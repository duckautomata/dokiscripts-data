00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,510
Welcome back, Master and Miss!

2
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,990
I am once again eating my dinner.

3
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,670
Hello everybody!

4
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,390
I'm back!

5
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,830
Welcome back!

6
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,950
Welcome back!

7
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,430
Welcome back!

8
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,070
We may be made in this, but we are made full!

9
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,950
Thank you guys!

10
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,170
Thank you!

11
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,150
Thank you!

12
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,690
Thank you!

13
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,230
Thank you!

14
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,490
Thank you!

15
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,670
Good morning!

16
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,710
Mint gaming!

17
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,170
It's mint gaming!

18
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,910
What am I eating today?

19
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,990
I'm eating chicken and rice once again.

20
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,030
And once again, eating chicken and rice!

21
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,330
I meant

22
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,290
I found four kittens in a storm drain near my house.

23
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,670
What do they...

24
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,530
What do...

25
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,910
What do they look healthy and are so so so cute?

26
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:41,970
Keep.

27
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,770
Four kittens?

28
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,550
That's a lot though.

29
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,530
That's a lot.

30
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,990
Chicken is appropriate considering the game.

31
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,710
So true!

32
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,450
We went to the chicken kitchen, didn't we?

33
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:52,970
Chicken kitchen chicken!

34
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,930
Chicken kitchen chicken!

35
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:56,690
No.

36
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,310
Sounds healthy.

37
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,510
Unless it's karaage.

38
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,430
It's not karaage.

39
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,490
I'm kind of healthy sometimes.

40
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,250
I'm kind of healthy.

41
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,670
Howdy howdy.

42
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,530
Hope you're well.

43
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,710
Detect the phantoms.

44
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,570
Wait, getting...

45
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,910
Wait, getting news.

46
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,350
This may not be the plot.

47
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,370
Thanks for the super chat!

48
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,250
I wonder what this buy and send button does.

49
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,650
You might want to check your bank account.

50
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,230
I think that'll answer it.

51
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,590
I think.

52
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:30,730
Maybe.

53
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,950
Mmm, karaage.

54
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,050
Yeah, now I'm thinking about karaage.

55
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,410
Fried chicken.

56
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:40,930
Yummy!

57
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,930
Welcome back to ghost trick.

58
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,750
I kind of want to just get into it today, if that's OK.

59
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,130
I kind of want to just dive right on in.

60
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:58,830
So we can start doing some ghost tricks and tips and tricks.

61
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,410
What was I going to say though?

62
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,170
Oh, I was going to do a recap.

63
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:15,230
Did you hear that?

64
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,490
Made Momoi and Midori are going to be playable.

65
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,790
They're going to be playable!

66
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,030
Have fun ghost drinking.

67
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,130
I did not hear that.

68
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,810
Made Momoi and Midori.

69
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,270
I will get them both.

70
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,470
Goodbye.

71
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,770
Goodbye jimmies.

72
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:44,390
Eat the nummy mouth food with your mouth using mouth food eating techniques that have been passed down through the generations.

73
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,170
Like onto mouth food eating techniques that get passed down.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,740
That was certainly a sentence.

75
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,220
That's just Yoko.

76
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,260
He's always like that.

77
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,500
True.

78
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,840
I mean, eating has been passed down, right?

79
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,480
Also, oh my gosh.

80
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,740
Garlamal, thank you for the akasimpa before the stream started.

81
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,480
Thank you so much.

82
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,800
Sorry, I have to like lean over to get my food.

83
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,960
Because of the way my desk is.

84
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,020
Where did we... I know where we left off on.

85
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,720
But I'm trying to think of what... Okay, so...

86
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,800
Oh, we started with the execution.

87
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,920
And we had to turn the power off.

88
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:59,520
And we had to get our... get the Chad man in a very stealthy sequence.

89
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,100
OMG, the bank just charged me.

90
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,500
Lamal, Lamal, Lamal, get charged, get charged, get charged.

91
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,620
Chad Jowd.

92
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,840
Yes, Detective Jowd.

93
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,460
And...

94
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,380
And we watched a guy gulp down a bunch of pills.

95
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,440
Yes, that happened too.

96
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,080
Yes, yes, yes.

97
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,760
So we got him through the jail.

98
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,180
Jailbreak, baby.

99
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,100
And then we... but then he got caught.

100
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,860
It was all for nothing.

101
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,240
He got caught by Elvis Detective.

102
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,960
Did Lin die again?

103
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,100
I don't think she did.

104
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,240
I don't think she did.

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,100
I just finished catching up to your previous ghost trick streams.

106
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,920
I'm right on time.

107
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,460
Let's go.

108
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,420
Thank you so much for watching them.

109
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,920
I really appreciate it.

110
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,020
Thank you.

111
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,720
Silly boy, welcome to membership.

112
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,760
And...

113
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,060
So then, after that happened, after we got him out...

114
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,040
Lin went to the commissioner guy to say, stop his execution.

115
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,600
But we realized the reason he's going through with the execution...

116
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,300
Baby Cortex for the five gifted.

117
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,960
Thank you so much.

118
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,020
The reason he's going through with the execution is because his daughter has been kidnapped by the hot blue lady.

119
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,660
Yippee.

120
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,060
Yeah, blue lady.

121
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,060
So we ended off on...

122
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,520
But actually, the daughter wasn't kidnapped.

123
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,120
She was just a hot lady.

124
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,920
As a ghost, what's it feel like when you encounter Ofuda Oshide?

125
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,340
As a ghost, I feel nothing.

126
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,580
Every day.

127
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,600
I feel nothing.

128
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,010
What was I going to say?

129
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:11,930
Oh!

130
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,660
And...

131
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,520
Oh yeah, we're now checking out the hot blue lady.

132
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,640
So I'm excited for this part.

133
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,000
So we're challenges.

134
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,220
Oh wait, just kidding.

135
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

136
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,780
I was under extras.

137
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,840
We're under continue.

138
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,160
How's the audio?

139
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,980
I think the main menu is a little quiet.

140
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,620
But...

141
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,180
Yeah, see the autosave.

142
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,020
We're at 1210 AM.

143
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,260
Oh yeah, we did save the commissioner's life by giving him his meds.

144
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,140
He went...

145
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,420
He...

146
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,040
He...

147
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,520
He...

148
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,240
He coped those down.

149
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,260
He...

150
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,840
He was used to that.

151
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,680
He's a...

152
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,100
He's a...

153
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,400
Yeah.

154
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,620
But yeah, let's go back into the autosave.

155
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,300
Let's just get right into it, baby.

156
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,460
I wonder if I should turn DVR off for this.

157
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,620
So people coming in can just kind of watch.

158
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,940
1210 AM.

159
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,520
The justice minister's daughter has been abducted.

160
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:29,040
The kidnappers demand the execution of the death row prisoner Zhao to be carried out tonight.

161
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,160
Yes, this is a good recap.

162
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,360
She's so hot.

163
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,340
Oh ma'am.

164
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,720
Even your silhouette.

165
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,560
Look at the way she just...

166
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,040
Just power sits.

167
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,860
I've never seen a power sit before like that.

168
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,520
Lin says the execution is a mistake and I believe her.

169
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,280
So I'm paying the kidnappers hideout a visit to see what I can find out about the abduction.

170
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,120
Yeah, that's a practice sit.

171
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,160
I want to be that chair.

172
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,660
I want to be that chair.

173
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,740
I want to be that chair.

174
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,780
I want to be that chair.

175
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,640
I want to be that chair.

176
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,680
Mike Tyson!

177
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,760
Thanks for the vibe, Captain.

178
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:08,800
You did.

179
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,920
What took you so long?

180
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,120
Who's here?

181
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,760
Oh, my goodness.

182
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,040
Your instinct was right, beauty, my dear.

183
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,680
Not this.

184
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,500
Not this guy.

185
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,020
They had that restaurant surrounded.

186
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,620
It took me forever to shake them.

187
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,900
And now my poor bike is ready for the scrap heap.

188
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,000
Not Shaggy.

189
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,760
I forgot about the voice.

190
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,140
It fits him though, doesn't it?

191
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,200
Oh, next time.

192
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,100
Maybe you should...

193
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,760
Oh, no.

194
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,280
I can't.

195
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,160
I can't be high.

196
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,700
I can't.

197
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,840
I can't do it.

198
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,260
Next time.

199
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,040
Maybe you should make it a tricycle so you don't hurt yourself.

200
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,620
Ouch, that hurts, beauty.

201
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,300
But that's okay.

202
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,720
That's what I love about you.

203
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,380
I can't un-hear Shaggy.

204
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,040
I'm doing the voice.

205
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,160
I'm doing the voice and I can't un-hear Shaggy.

206
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,300
Ba-bum.

207
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:40,460
Du-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, Happy birthday!

208
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,580
Be a little more gentle with our valuable hot seat.

209
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,280
Wait, is she in the box?

210
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,320
I have to voice them.

211
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,140
Thanks, I think?

212
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,440
You are truly Minto... Minto-minded.

213
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,600
Minto-minded, Minto-minded.

214
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,520
Pet girls!

215
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,200
Welcome to the membership, thank you so much!

216
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,860
Yes, a wry smile.

217
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,050
I'm going out for a breath of fresh air.

218
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,470
You're on guard duty.

219
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,990
Alright, I'll dream of you until you return.

220
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,850
Why don't you open the trunk for our...

221
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,730
guest.

222
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,650
I will, beauty.

223
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:57,110
I was just taking a little breather.

224
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,650
So when I asked for sultry Minto a while back, this was it.

225
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:03,710
Also...

226
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,030
I am going to turn up the sounds just a little bit.

227
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,190
Maybe like that.

228
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,030
Sorry, I just don't want to be... I know I do this every time.

229
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,790
Ciao!

230
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,650
Thanks for the gifting!

231
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,800
All right, little lady.

232
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,040
Let me open that trunk for you.

233
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,720
Oh, okay.

234
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,660
Oh, is he actually going to fall asleep?

235
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,120
Beauty!

236
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,420
Oh wait, there was a birthday party here.

237
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,540
What, because there's like streamers and then there's a birthday cake?

238
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,360
Looks like the Justice Minister's daughter really has been kidnapped.

239
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,360
Something else is bothering me too.

240
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,780
Wait, if we go back to their house though...

241
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,460
I don't think I've ever been to this room before.

242
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,840
But something about it is giving me a strange sense of deja vu.

243
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,480
I've seen something like this before.

244
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,580
Yes, this is just like the room in the... that Lin got killed in.

245
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,400
I'll let you guess which one.

246
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,240
Trick time, trick time, trick time.

247
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,700
Taking something... Oh.

248
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,720
Okay, I want to bring something up that someone...

249
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,000
One big streamer on... Am I too big?

250
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,500
Here, I'll make myself small.

251
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,260
Sorry, am I too big?

252
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,620
So, last time I played I got... I saw like a comment from someone.

253
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,120
That said that they were kind of sad that...

254
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,920
I was skipping some of the funniest dialogue because...

255
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:52,020
Because I was trying not to get hints for the puzzles.

256
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,000
And while I understand...

257
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,840
That, you know, sometimes there might be stuff that I miss in general.

258
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,480
You know...

259
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,040
I'll do better about... You know what?

260
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,980
I won't care so much about the hint stuff so much this time.

261
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,420
If anything, not big enough.

262
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,380
Thank you for the first ever super time.

263
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,020
Thank you.

264
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,040
Thanks, eventual ghosts.

265
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,240
But...

266
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,820
So...

267
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,120
But also, I...

268
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,840
You know...

269
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,900
And sometimes in games like this, there might be stuff that I miss.

270
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,300
So...

271
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,720
That's just kind of the nature of these types of games maybe.

272
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,600
Sometimes you miss dialogue.

273
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,300
So...

274
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,440
Some of the funny dialogue is in the word bubbles.

275
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,220
Yeah, so...

276
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,320
I'll do my best to...

277
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,320
To hit them.

278
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,340
But sometimes I might forget, so...

279
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:47,940
Yeah.

280
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,380
Sorry if I do.

281
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,760
Okay.

282
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,000
That's all I wanted to talk about since I got reminded because of the bubble.

283
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,640
Taking something precious to manipulate others.

284
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,400
So that's what kidnapping is.

285
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,380
I guess...

286
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,040
But doesn't the kid need to be involved?

287
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,700
The dirty tricks those without...

288
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:08,980
Wait.

289
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,820
The dirty...

290
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,620
The dirty tricks those without the powers of the dead...

291
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,520
Oh.

292
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,540
Oh!

293
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,280
The dirty tricks those without the powers of the dead come up with.

294
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:22,860
My goodness.

295
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,420
I cannot comprehend this sentence.

296
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,240
Deposit in Mint Bank TM.

297
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,560
Thank you.

298
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:29,920
Cha-ching!

299
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,040
Deposited.

300
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:33,920
However...

301
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,160
If I take that precious thing back...

302
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,720
Marisa.

303
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,260
Oh my god.

304
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,940
Cecil stole the precious thing.

305
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,340
I hate you.

306
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,660
I hate you.

307
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,780
Navin.

308
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,140
Ang!

309
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,360
Ang!

310
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:44,660
Ang!

311
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:44,880
Ang!

312
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,060
If I take that precious thing back, their power vanishes, doesn't it?

313
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,100
So true.

314
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,920
Look at this.

315
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,620
Look at this bozo sleeping on the job.

316
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,780
Now then.

317
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,280
Time to see how the justice minister's little girl is doing.

318
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,840
Before this guy wakes up from his dream of beauty.

319
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,420
Oh, he's snoring.

320
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,100
I'm going ghost.

321
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,560
Swing.

322
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,420
Decoration.

323
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:15,960
Decoration.

324
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,880
What's this down here?

325
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,200
Let's open the door.

326
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,740
I think that'll get us furthest.

327
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,140
Oh.

328
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,860
Open the door again.

329
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,120
Wait.

330
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,220
I pressed X.

331
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,220
Oh.

332
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,520
Okay.

333
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,440
I can't go.

334
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,340
I can't ghost trick.

335
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,400
Okay.

336
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:37,740
Never mind.

337
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,660
What are you doing?

338
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:41,800
What are you doing?

339
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,260
What are you doing?

340
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,540
So...

341
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:45,520
Swing!

342
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:46,980
Oh.

343
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,800
Doesn't do so much.

344
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:51,900
Oh.

345
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:53,720
Mmhm.

346
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,500
Okay.

347
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:00,850
Swing!

348
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,650
Why does it go so far to the left?

349
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,330
Not to the right?

350
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:06,810
Okay.

351
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,710
There's one other thing we can do, which is this.

352
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,550
Burned dry.

353
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,050
Oh.

354
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,470
It's on fire.

355
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,150
Oh.

356
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,070
Oh, my God.

357
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,890
Oh, we just caused a fire.

358
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,710
Wait.

359
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,170
Oh.

360
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,170
But that's gonna drop then.

361
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:19,990
I knew it!

362
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:20,470
Awww.

363
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:20,770
Oh.

364
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:21,330
The fire.

365
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:27,230
Here I thought we were going to be setting the place on fire, but now we swing here.

366
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,080
Arson!

367
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,920
Let's spin faster.

368
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,460
Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin.

369
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,860
Oh, interesting.

370
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,660
Oh, my bad.

371
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,240
Hold on.

372
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,320
Let's see, what did that say?

373
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,940
The ball.

374
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
A ball that rolls off a table.

375
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,500
I've already seen something like this once already tonight.

376
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,020
It's true.

377
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,980
I wonder if this ball does anything.

378
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,100
Okay.

379
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,580
Now we're here, here...

380
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,800
Lower the shade...

381
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,480
Move the sconce...

382
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,340
Suspend the shelf... I meant the clock.

383
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,400
Let's move down.

384
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,120
Lower the shade.

385
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,060
I'm under his... Oh, darn.

386
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,800
I can't reach my destination from here.

387
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,920
Okay.

388
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,740
Thank you.

389
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,480
What if we rock and the clock falls?

390
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:57,800
No.

391
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,460
The shelf is suspended by very thin cords.

392
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,220
They look like they're about to break.

393
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,880
I bet it'd be quite a spectacle if that...

394
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,200
If something can break it...

395
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,920
Oh, wait.

396
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,140
If something can break, it kind of makes me want to break it.

397
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:13,580
Oh, my gosh.

398
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:15,900
Cecil.

399
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,500
Why are you such a...

400
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,300
Why are you such a troublemaker, huh?

401
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,140
What?

402
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,960
That's just... Huh?

403
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,660
This is one of those things you light with fire, isn't it?

404
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,640
Do we need to really set this place on fire?

405
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,560
As long as there's light in the room.

406
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,340
Is something like this really necessary?

407
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,960
But if something can be lit, it kind of makes me want to light it.

408
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,400
I need another core to reach the trunk and open it.

409
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,380
I wonder if I can create a new core.

410
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,820
So we need to... We need to burn this.

411
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,400
We need to set things on fire, baby.

412
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,760
He is truly a menace.

413
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:58,900
Doll.

414
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,260
Let's go back to where we were before.

415
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,660
Oh, I'm already feeling myself getting so hungry.

416
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,540
Wait.

417
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,420
Oh, wait.

418
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,320
Yeah, we can...

419
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,040
Oh,

420
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,140
wait.

421
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
We can... We can go back this way.

422
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,040
Like so.

423
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:20,600
Okay.

424
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:21,760
Easy peasy.

425
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,540
Hmm.

426
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,400
Now, if I open the door...

427
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,320
Oh!

428
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,230
I was gonna possess the ball.

429
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:35,370
Hmm.

430
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,090
Food check.

431
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,190
I have my food.

432
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,070
It's just hard to eat when I'm reading so much, you know?

433
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,170
Sorry, guys.

434
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:43,930
Before...

435
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,250
Before stream, I was recording with...

436
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,050
With Matara for the podcast.

437
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,350
With Matara for the podcast.

438
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,010
And, um...

439
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:58,690
We started kind of late because we both got back from doctor's appointments late.

440
00:22:59,050 --> 00:22:59,290
Hahaha.

441
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:16,610
Hmm.

442
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:16,950
Hmm.

443
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,170
Okay.

444
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,560
Can I set anything else on fire?

445
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,700
What else can I set on fire?

446
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:35,960
Hmm.

447
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,480
What else can I set on fire?

448
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:43,900
Hmm.

449
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,120
Oh!

450
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,600
Nice!

451
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:49,960
Nice!

452
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,200
Nice!

453
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,720
Oh!

454
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,580
We can... We can...

455
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:52,960
Fire!

456
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,640
Fire!

457
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,000
Fire!

458
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:54,800
Hahaha.

459
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,740
Burn, baby.

460
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,280
Burn.

461
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,380
My heart.

462
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,000
Hmm?

463
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,120
Heartburn?

464
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,500
If you have heartburn, are you okay?

465
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,700
I don't wanna do this out of order and have to restart.

466
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,460
So, let's see.

467
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,700
The present?

468
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,400
Hmm.

469
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,660
Set our hearts ablaze?

470
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,180
You want me to set you on fire?

471
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,690
Joshua, thank you!

472
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,450
Good evening, man.

473
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,950
A few more dollars for the mental bank.

474
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,110
Have you heard...

475
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:51,550
Hearing you sing Final Fantasy songs warms my JRPG-loving heart.

476
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,470
Do you have a favorite Final Fantasy game?

477
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:57,290
I'll be honest, I haven't played so many Final Fantasy games.

478
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,450
Um...

479
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,930
So, I probably like my first one, which was...

480
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,610
Um, Final...

481
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,770
Well, actually, I played Final Fantasy X-2 first.

482
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,370
But, uh...

483
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,670
I really like Final Fantasy X and X-2.

484
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,290
Hmm.

485
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,980
Let's see what happens if we spin this.

486
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,780
It's gonna go up...

487
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,560
And then it goes back down.

488
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,240
Okay.

489
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,520
But I can't do anything while it's doing that.

490
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,500
Okay.

491
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:39,980
Cool.

492
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,440
Um...

493
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:44,940
Maybe...

494
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,560
Maybe we have this firecracker.

495
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,380
Okay, you know what?

496
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,560
Let's just go party popper.

497
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:51,820
Fire!

498
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,300
Oh!

499
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,160
I was gonna say...

500
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,300
Maybe if...

501
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,260
Ah!

502
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,960
I was gonna say...

503
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,620
Maybe...

504
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:01,980
Um...

505
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,420
Would...

506
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,360
Get something stuck either on the spinner or on the fan.

507
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,500
Nice.

508
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:06,760
Okay.

509
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,340
6, 9 and 12 are my favorites.

510
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,880
Oh, and then I've also...

511
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,600
I've played a little bit of 7.

512
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,440
But I know...

513
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,320
I've watched playthroughs of 7, so...

514
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,960
Just my imagination.

515
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,240
That's all he has to say.

516
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,220
If he was any more laid back, he'd fall right off that crate.

517
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,620
But look at that streamer going...

518
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,080
Go...

519
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,360
Go spinning round and round.

520
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,640
Now, how can I make use of that?

521
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:35,820
Yes.

522
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,660
Yes.

523
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,520
Yes.

524
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,200
Where am I?

525
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,340
Oh, I'm on the party popper.

526
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,980
Maybe we get it tied up here.

527
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,420
Get tied up!

528
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,780
How far does it reach?

529
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,640
Not enough for the firecracker.

530
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,840
I think I'm just gonna have to set the place on fire.

531
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,200
Fire!

532
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:08,860
Oh!

533
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,630
That leads...

534
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,010
Just my imagination.

535
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,330
That leads straight up to the fire.

536
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,750
Fire, fire, light the fire.

537
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,270
What an amazingly simple fellow.

538
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,710
This room, on the other hand, is starting to look amazingly festive.

539
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,910
The question is, how can I use it to my advantage?

540
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,210
Okay.

541
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,890
If I...

542
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:37,770
Go up here...

543
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,550
If I bring this up now, what does it do?

544
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:42,630
Oh!

545
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,150
It's all tied up.

546
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:48,370
Interesting.

547
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:48,910
Okay.

548
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,700
I'm still confused what to do with the spinning guy, though.

549
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,380
Hmm.

550
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,640
I'm actually kind of stumped.

551
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:10,960
Hmm.

552
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:15,630
Hmm.

553
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:20,940
Whatever.

554
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,010
Yeah.

555
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:28,270
There's the...

556
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,370
There's a candle on the doll, too.

557
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:29,710
Yes.

558
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,690
I have noticed that.

559
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,770
I have noted that.

560
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:33,270
Yes.

561
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,730
I think...

562
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,350
Does the...

563
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,290
Does the string...

564
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,510
Hold on.

565
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:37,930
Let's see.

566
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,190
Does it reach...

567
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,590
No, it doesn't...

568
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:45,290
I was like, maybe if that catches on fire and then spins over to her...

569
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:47,210
Hmm.

570
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,630
We've done.

571
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,990
Let's raise it...

572
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,510
The fire again, maybe.

573
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,050
Hmm.

574
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,150
Hmm.

575
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:05,830
Here we go.

576
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,110
Ghost!

577
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,730
And back this way.

578
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,330
Aw dang.

579
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,670
And this way.

580
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,870
And this way, this way, this way, this way.

581
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,630
Burn brighter.

582
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,490
Not...

583
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,650
It doesn't reach.

584
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:31,750
When the flame gets really big like this for some reason, I get the urge to burn something.

585
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,090
Unfortunately, everything is just out of the flame.

586
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,190
There's nothing else I can interact with except the door.

587
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,150
Oh, come on.

588
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,650
Oh, come on!

589
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,380
Oh, maybe spin faster.

590
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,580
That's right.

591
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,420
Okay, that's right.

592
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,240
Okay, there we go, there we go.

593
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,380
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn!

594
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,780
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn!

595
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,820
Oh my god.

596
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,060
Oh my god, it's on fire.

597
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,100
Oh, I figured it out.

598
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,540
Good luck.

599
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,560
I figured it out too!

600
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,280
Wait.

601
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,100
Okay, so that's on fire now.

602
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,440
And now we need to raise this...

603
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,380
to be on fire as well.

604
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,960
I figured it out too.

605
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:38,920
Spin!

606
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,120
What about the ball though?

607
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:53,450
Nice!

608
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:53,990
Oh!

609
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,630
Just your imagination.

610
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,790
Tensai.

611
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,370
Thank you, thank you.

612
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,610
And we're in, baby.

613
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,690
That's the daughter?

614
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,130
Wait, she's just chilling.

615
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,490
What in the...

616
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,190
What's going on here?

617
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,670
Whose footprints are these?

618
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,970
This little lady is...

619
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,470
Her.

620
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,690
I thought it was the girl in the bed.

621
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:30,250
Is this little lady really a daughter of the justice minister?

622
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,680
Oh, just my imagination.

623
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:44,860
It was not...

624
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,040
Oh!

625
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:50,980
Uh...

626
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,240
They caught the wrong girl.

627
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,820
What's with the fun book and juice?

628
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,260
Like I said.

629
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,080
Always keep a smile on a lady's face.

630
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,980
I wanted to treat our guest well.

631
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,300
How about treating me well?

632
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:09,840
Ooh!

633
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,240
Oh my gosh, Shaggy.

634
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,100
Are you telling you're not treating my girl well?

635
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,780
Should have been me.

636
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I'll treat you well.

637
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,540
I'll treat you well, Madame Blue.

638
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,040
Mm-hmm.

639
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,480
I volunteer.

640
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:29,640
I volunteer.

641
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,160
I'd like some bread and milk, please.

642
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,900
Not your sor...

643
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,430
Oh no, am I Shaggy?

644
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,310
Why did I know what he was going to say?

645
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,960
Oh no.

646
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,220
I don't know.

647
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,960
You're a maid, that's why?

648
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,660
Yes, yes, yes.

649
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,540
Yes, yes, yes.

650
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:06,800
That's all.

651
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:06,800
That's all.

652
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,120
That's all.

653
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,240
It's only because I'm a maid, everybody.

654
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,780
It's only because I'm a maid, everybody.

655
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,640
Oh no.

656
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,740
Not your service, my dear.

657
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,640
Me back in a flash.

658
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,700
You better skedaddle out of there.

659
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,280
I better see you.

660
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,400
I better see dust coming off your feet from running so fast.

661
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,520
Hey, mister.

662
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,220
I think she also wants bread and milk.

663
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,980
Yes, cute little lady.

664
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,980
More juice, perhaps?

665
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,020
All you have to do is ask.

666
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,540
Have I been kidnapped?

667
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,000
Oh.

668
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,640
Oh.

669
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,140
Don't cry, little dear.

670
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,160
There's nothing to be afraid of.

671
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,340
The surroundings are miserable and filthy, I know.

672
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,520
But we just ask for a little patience.

673
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,500
Don't say those ugly words.

674
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,740
Don't say those awful things about this house.

675
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,600
This house is...

676
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,040
Where I used to live.

677
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,760
So what does...

678
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,740
What does the guy from the...

679
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,860
How does the guy...

680
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,380
From the...

681
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,380
Junkyard...

682
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,660
Know...

683
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,780
What her room looks like?

684
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,320
Zoinks.

685
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,720
What?

686
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,760
What?

687
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,100
What?

688
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,780
What?

689
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,840
I apologize, little lady.

690
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,700
I'm the one who's miserable and filthy.

691
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,760
Forgive me.

692
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,040
Wait, so...

693
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,220
I think my theory last time was that...

694
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,240
Was that...

695
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,340
Uh...

696
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,460
Lin killed...

697
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,000
Um...

698
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,060
The mom?

699
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,240
But now I'm thinking...

700
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,760
Um...

701
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,100
Maybe...

702
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,220
It was accidentally...

703
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,540
Her.

704
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,620
What's her name?

705
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,320
Now I'm thinking is that maybe it's her...

706
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,180
Instead.

707
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,600
And that's...

708
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,400
But Lin still knows the truth about Detective Jowd.

709
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,440
Camilla.

710
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:22,780
Camilla.

711
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

712
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:23,600
Camilla.

713
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:23,860
Camilla.

714
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,520
DL6 incident?

715
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:28,920
Ah...

716
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,000
That would be on...

717
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,200
That would be...

718
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,300
That would be on brand for this...

719
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,160
For this creator.

720
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,660
What's the meaning of this beauty?

721
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:37,760
I don't know.

722
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,680
Why here?

723
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,160
At this...

724
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,800
At this girl's old house?

725
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,760
Don't ask me.

726
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,560
It was the other party in our deal who chose this location.

727
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:48,940
Oh...

728
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,940
Oh, I see.

729
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,680
It's been empty for five years and apparently nobody ever comes here.

730
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,960
But never mind that.

731
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,040
What about my bread and milk?

732
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,340
Oh...

733
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,380
Oh, of course.

734
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,500
Skedaddle now.

735
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,100
Shaggy.

736
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,560
Now you be a good girl while I'm gone.

737
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,480
Oh my god.

738
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,360
Look at him tiptoe.

739
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,360
Hurry up.

740
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,360
Go get the bread and milk.

741
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,160
Let the ladies speak.

742
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,160
You just read your book and drink your juice.

743
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,400
You'll never know the truth.

744
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,740
There's not a parrot in sight.

745
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,560
I wanna go home.

746
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,980
Not quite yet.

747
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,780
This dilapidated place was Camilla's old house?

748
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,480
What's going on here?

749
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,540
Trick time.

750
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,520
Alright, Camilla.

751
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,640
Camilla...

752
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,520
Wait, what in the world?

753
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,040
Why does the little lady have a core of the dead?

754
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,760
I was gonna say, she never died before.

755
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,260
When I helped her out at Lin's apartment...

756
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:01,740
Wait, no.

757
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,440
She did die technically though, right?

758
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,220
Because...

759
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:05,660
Um...

760
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:06,760
Wait.

761
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,060
Actually, I'm not sure.

762
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:08,740
Wait.

763
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,540
No.

764
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,060
Because he killed the dog and then her.

765
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,880
But we never talked to her.

766
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
It was her dog.

767
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,720
Oh, you're right.

768
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,620
Maybe I just assumed that she was going to die.

769
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,240
But it was actually her going to get kidnapped.

770
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,810
When I helped her out at Lin's apartment...

771
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:37,750
She didn't have one.

772
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,250
So that must mean...

773
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:46,030
She must have died sometime after that.

774
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,270
Once again, the incident.

775
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,510
Wait, what incident?

776
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,470
And it also means...

777
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,730
Somebody else must have saved her.

778
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,510
Wait, what?

779
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,790
I'd better ask her what happened.

780
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:01,230
Unless...

781
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,330
Unless something that we fixed saved her, right?

782
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,250
That could happen.

783
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,630
What's the book she's reading?

784
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,070
A book?

785
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:13,730
I wonder what the little lady is reading tonight.

786
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,610
An exciting adventure story, maybe?

787
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:21,230
Although she's already getting quite a bit of excitement for one day.

788
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:23,750
Look at her sipping.

789
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,410
She's so cute.

790
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,090
Somewhere along the way, Camilla must have died.

791
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,630
What could have happened to her?

792
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,570
I'd better ask her.

793
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:31,650
Who could it be?

794
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,570
There's somebody else with the powers of the dead besides me.

795
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,230
I don't know.

796
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:37,510
Okay.

797
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,310
Let's get inside her brain.

798
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,190
Who's there?

799
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,030
Oh, wait a minute.

800
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,310
Is that you, Missile?

801
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,570
Wait, Missile?

802
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:50,370
Missile?

803
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:51,890
I'm sorry.

804
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:52,770
I'm not Missile.

805
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,030
My name's Sissel.

806
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,190
Did Missile save her?

807
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:57,650
No way.

808
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:58,830
Sissel?

809
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,390
My name is Camilla.

810
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,530
Yeah, where is Missile actually?

811
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:05,910
Camilla.

812
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:06,210
Camilla.

813
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,210
So, it is her.

814
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:07,950
I knew it.

815
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,110
What happened to me?

816
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,290
What is this place?

817
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,670
I can hardly tell the poor little thing.

818
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,890
Oh, I can hardly tell the poor little thing.

819
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,050
This is the land of the dead.

820
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,350
The land of the dead?

821
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,470
What does that mean?

822
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,830
Oh, she could hear our thoughts.

823
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,290
Does that mean I'm dead?

824
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:28,650
Darn.

825
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,570
I forgot there are no secrets in the ghost world.

826
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,190
You can relax.

827
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,250
You're not dead.

828
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,210
But this isn't the first time you've been in the ghost world.

829
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,010
You've been here, apparently.

830
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,430
Really?

831
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,590
I don't remember.

832
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,930
There are no thoughts here.

833
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:44,410
Wait a minute.

834
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:45,790
Maybe I do remember.

835
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:47,470
Sort of.

836
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:48,750
What?

837
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:49,990
May

838
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,000
I have a birthday song?

839
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,920
My wish this year is to go to Mint's meet and greet.

840
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,800
Thank you!

841
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,300
Of course I can sing you.

842
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:07,600
Hold on.

843
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,840
For some reason, it's so loud for me, but it's not so loud for you.

844
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,700
I will sing you happy birthday.

845
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,880
Hold on.

846
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,340
Let me...

847
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,980
Let me...

848
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,500
Hold on first.

849
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:19,800
OK.

850
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,120
Happy birthday to you.

851
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,920
Happy birthday to you.

852
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,080
Happy birthday, dear.

853
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:38,120
Happy birthday to you!

854
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,720
Woo!

855
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,880
I'll hope your birthday wish comes true.

856
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,640
Also, I saw someone say that the game is loud?

857
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,660
It is?

858
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,840
How about here?

859
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,180
How about here?

860
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,920
Maybe I do remember, sort of.

861
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,260
It's fine?

862
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,700
You do?

863
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,360
It looks like she doesn't remember being saved very well.

864
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,280
Was that not good before?

865
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,540
Like there?

866
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,540
So there's some other dead person out there with special powers, eh?

867
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,100
Anyway, I don't want to press her if she doesn't remember dying.

868
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,340
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions about something else?

869
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,020
Sure, go ahead, sissy!

870
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:33,940
Sissy, eh?

871
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:37,460
Kidnapping.

872
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,120
Lynn asked me to do something for her tonight.

873
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,960
I know about that part.

874
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,480
She asked you to go to the chicken kitchen on Dead End Drive, right?

875
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,340
Sissy.

876
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,260
Yeah, but I never got there.

877
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,240
Now I wish I could say I'm sorry to her.

878
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,020
I never should have gone through that park.

879
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,360
What park?

880
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,440
Temsik Park.

881
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,280
It's a shortcut to Dead End Drive.

882
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,260
Oh my gosh, did she like get hit by the truck?

883
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,700
Did she get isekai'd?

884
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,720
Is that where the kidnappers grabbed you?

885
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,340
Yeah, Lynn always says.

886
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:15,900
Always said.

887
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,700
I don't like that park.

888
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,120
Scary things happen there.

889
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:23,800
That's where she also got held hostage, right?

890
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,120
Yeah, that's where we...

891
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,900
That's where she got held hostage.

892
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,120
HMS, welcome to membership.

893
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,080
Thank you so much.

894
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,920
Thank you, thank you.

895
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,230
Temsik Park, eh?

896
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,290
What am I going to do?

897
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,970
Lynn's going to be so mad.

898
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:46,450
Aww.

899
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,990
She's not going to be mad that you got kidnapped.

900
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,110
Well, she's going to be mad that you got kidnapped.

901
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:53,750
Yeah, she's going to be mad.

902
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,300
She is?

903
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:00,940
How come?

904
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:04,980
Uh-oh.

905
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,620
Because I left it there.

906
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,120
It's probably the music box.

907
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,020
Vanilla, welcome to membership.

908
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,500
The music box in the park.

909
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,160
This is the music box that...

910
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:15,880
Um...

911
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,180
That, uh...

912
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,020
Detective Jowd said that we needed to look into.

913
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,320
That's right, the music box.

914
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,080
Oh, let's ask her.

915
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,960
That music box was hidden in the apartment.

916
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,160
I finally found it with a little bit of luck and courage.

917
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,100
Mwah.

918
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,120
And me.

919
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,600
Actually, just me.

920
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:38,360
Guess where it was.

921
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,060
I don't know.

922
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:40,600
Where?

923
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,620
I'll pretend I don't...

924
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,640
She can still hear our thoughts.

925
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,300
I'll pretend I don't know.

926
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,280
You know.

927
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,320
Hello,

928
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,680
welcome to membership.

929
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,840
You don't have to humor me.

930
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:55,860
Oops.

931
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,020
So what happened to the music box?

932
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,360
I hid it in the bushes at the park just before it happened.

933
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:04,720
Just before?

934
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,820
Oh, just before you were kidnapped, huh?

935
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,520
I didn't want the bad man to take it, so I hid it.

936
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,330
I bet it's still there in the park.

937
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,050
You did well.

938
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:20,530
So the music box is in the park.

939
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:21,810
I'd better let Lynn know.

940
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,270
All right, let's ask about Camilla.

941
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,450
This is your old house?

942
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:27,650
Yep.

943
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,730
This is where we lived until five years ago.

944
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,770
But now I live with Lynn and Mistle.

945
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,630
Lynn is like a big sister to you, isn't she?

946
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:35,990
Yep.

947
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,330
She's a detective, you know.

948
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,410
She's a hero.

949
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,030
She is, huh?

950
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,670
Why are you so surprised by that?

951
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,570
By the way, about your father.

952
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,030
Is he the detective?

953
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:48,650
Is he the justice minister?

954
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:52,750
My father is gone.

955
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:55,790
Gone?

956
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:57,250
Maybe he passed away?

957
00:44:58,330 --> 00:44:59,450
No, that's not it.

958
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:00,850
My dad...

959
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:02,350
Is Detective Jowd.

960
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,710
He's going to die.

961
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:06,430
And it's all because of me.

962
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:08,330
What?

963
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,050
What do you mean because of me?

964
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:12,310
Why would you say that?

965
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,630
Oh my God, was I right?

966
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:16,790
It's called an execu...

967
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:19,570
I'm sorry.

968
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:20,030
Uh-oh.

969
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,870
Uh-oh.

970
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:24,170
It's called an execution.

971
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,050
My dad is...

972
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:27,110
A detective.

973
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:28,990
No way.

974
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:30,750
Don't tell me your father is...

975
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:31,790
Detective Jowd?

976
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,570
That's right.

977
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,590
I so called it.

978
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:39,450
What in the world?

979
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:43,250
Five years ago, something really bad happened.

980
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:44,850
Like a scary dream.

981
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:46,530
But it wasn't a dream.

982
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,590
Five years ago...

983
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:49,550
I'm sorry.

984
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:50,650
That murder case...

985
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,360
Was the guy in the...

986
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,160
She didn't kill her mom either!

987
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,340
Was the guy...

988
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,620
In the...

989
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:10,440
In the park?

990
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,160
In the...

991
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:11,580
In the...

992
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,320
In the...

993
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,160
Junkyard?

994
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,860
Was he recreating how...

995
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,420
How...

996
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,520
The mom died?

997
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:24,430
You know?

998
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:27,410
Oh...

999
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:28,610
Maybe...

1000
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:30,150
Or...

1001
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:31,630
Something...

1002
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:38,790
What are you cooking?

1003
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:43,650
Five years ago...

1004
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:44,730
That murder case...

1005
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,710
Incident five years ago...

1006
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:51,790
That was my mom's birthday that day.

1007
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,970
My mom and dad were working and I was home by myself.

1008
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:57,910
And then I had an idea.

1009
00:46:58,090 --> 00:46:58,590
I was going to go to work.

1010
00:46:58,610 --> 00:46:59,590
I was going to surprise my mom.

1011
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:00,970
She set up a contraption.

1012
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:02,430
And she thinks she killed her mom.

1013
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:03,730
I set up...

1014
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:06,470
Okay.

1015
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:07,550
What the hell?

1016
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:08,710
I promise.

1017
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:10,450
I have not played this game before.

1018
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:14,010
I promise.

1019
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,230
What is going on?

1020
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:19,070
Literally the next line.

1021
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:19,970
Am I...

1022
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,490
I'm so psychic today.

1023
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:24,730
Wow.

1024
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:26,370
Pre-watched.

1025
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:27,910
Are you reading...

1026
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:29,070
Are you reading a synopsis, man?

1027
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:29,490
No!

1028
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:30,930
I promise.

1029
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:31,430
I promise.

1030
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:33,630
I set up that contraption.

1031
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,330
Oh, my God.

1032
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:39,650
I'm home, Camilla.

1033
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:41,250
Why is it dark?

1034
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:42,590
Oh, my God.

1035
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:49,130
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

1036
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:50,950
And then it set on fire and everything died.

1037
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,730
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

1038
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:55,790
Oh, my God.

1039
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:57,470
Oh, my God.

1040
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:57,470
Wait.

1041
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:57,890
Oh, my God.

1042
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:57,890
Oh, my God.

1043
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:57,890
Oh, my God.

1044
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:57,890
Oh, my God.

1045
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:57,890
Oh, my God.

1046
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:01,170
Oh, my God.

1047
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:02,430
Oh, my God.

1048
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:04,530
What was the point of all the rest of it?

1049
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:08,290
Why did you set this up?

1050
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:10,990
What did you think was going to happen?

1051
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:19,590
What was that noise?

1052
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,580
Still can't believe that happened.

1053
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,460
It wasn't supposed to work like that.

1054
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,140
So, someone messed with it.

1055
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,360
Someone tampered with her contraption.

1056
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,940
I know that contraption!

1057
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:42,420
Yes!

1058
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:43,940
It's exactly what I said!

1059
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,200
And I know how it was supposed to work!

1060
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,060
Wait, how was it supposed to work?

1061
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,520
Wait, I know how it was supposed to work?

1062
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,120
It was supposed to... the poppers!

1063
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,700
Yeah, it was supposed to do the poppers!

1064
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,040
That's right.

1065
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,040
Party poppers and a cake and a birthday message.

1066
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,580
Yes, yes, now I remember, now I remember.

1067
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,200
Camilla lost her mom to a TikTok challenge.

1068
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,280
Don't say it like that.

1069
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,040
Mint hasn't played the game before.

1070
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,960
That means she made it.

1071
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,380
I haven't seen the creator of Ghost Trick and Mint in the same room before.

1072
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,380
Yes, we redirected the cupid.

1073
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:22,760
That's right.

1074
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,200
That's right.

1075
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,120
But also, why was the gun loaded?

1076
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,240
My dad told me not to tell anybody.

1077
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,300
Just leave it to me, he said.

1078
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:34,820
Aww, poor girl.

1079
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,620
My dad wanted to be executed.

1080
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,280
He asked them for it.

1081
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,140
Okay, name, welcome to membership.

1082
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,980
But I wanted to tell everybody it was my fault!

1083
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,280
My dad said what I saw was a bad dream.

1084
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,460
He told me to forget it.

1085
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,680
This is all so unbelievably tragic.

1086
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,820
America, who doesn't have a loaded gun on their wall?

1087
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,880
So true.

1088
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,840
I can't believe it.

1089
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,600
This little lady is Detective Jowd's daughter.

1090
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,910
Girl, your contraption is absolutely killing it.

1091
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:17,470
I can't tell her.

1092
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:18,350
I just can't tell her.

1093
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,590
I can't tell her why she was kidnapped.

1094
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:21,830
ZK!

1095
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:23,310
Thanks for the 10 gift and thank you!

1096
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:25,070
Why was I kidnapped?

1097
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:26,210
I want to know!

1098
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:27,510
Oops.

1099
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,370
There are no secrets in the ghost world.

1100
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:32,190
Maybe we'd better stop talking.

1101
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,030
It's too dangerous.

1102
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:37,210
Sissy, you're not going to talk to me anymore?

1103
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:41,290
I think we'd better get you out of here first.

1104
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:42,710
We can talk more after that.

1105
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:45,770
Okay, but...

1106
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:46,690
Oops.

1107
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:49,250
I love how he just goes, oops.

1108
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:50,770
Whoopsie-poopsie.

1109
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:53,430
I'm going to rescue you now.

1110
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,810
You just hold on a little longer, alright?

1111
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,510
Okay, but we'll talk later, right?

1112
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:02,890
Don't forget.

1113
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:04,030
You promised, Sissy.

1114
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:06,430
Yippie.

1115
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,820
Different places have different traditions.

1116
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,640
Birthday punches, birthday death contraptions, they're all equally valid.

1117
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:21,420
Only the strong survive the birthday contraption.

1118
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,140
What took you so long?

1119
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,800
Wait, sorry.

1120
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,380
What took you so long?

1121
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:34,380
I traveled the entire town in search of the finest bread and milk for you, my dear.

1122
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,300
But it's late, and all the shops are closed.

1123
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,240
We're leaving this place right now.

1124
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,480
I don't... I can't get her voice right anymore.

1125
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:45,860
What?

1126
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,620
But he's not here yet.

1127
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:51,940
If we couldn't meet at the restaurant, weren't we supposed to meet here?

1128
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,760
Yes, and he's the one who chose this location.

1129
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,020
I don't like this one bit.

1130
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,000
I can never un-hear Shaggy.

1131
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,980
I think I'm leaning more into the Shaggy since I can't stop it.

1132
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,040
It's just happening.

1133
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,380
Let it... let Shaggy take over, okay?

1134
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:10,880
Let... let...

1135
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,840
Kinda sounds like Shaggy from Skipper.

1136
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:14,920
Just let this Shaggy take over, okay?

1137
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,660
We have to run around doing all this extra work all for the sake of his deal.

1138
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,040
Be quiet.

1139
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,320
It can't be helped.

1140
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,980
This place is too dangerous.

1141
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,800
I told you, my sixth sense is very strong.

1142
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,460
Oh, she senses me.

1143
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,580
As you wish, beauty.

1144
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,140
I feel it.

1145
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,540
I sense something.

1146
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:45,620
Here.

1147
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,500
In this room.

1148
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:47,880
It's me.

1149
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,120
It's me.

1150
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,600
Is somebody there?

1151
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,000
Can you hear me?

1152
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,360
She's talking to me.

1153
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,040
She's talking to me.

1154
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:01,980
She's talking to me, you guys.

1155
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:02,440
She's talking to me.

1156
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:02,860
Straight to me.

1157
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,240
Straight to me.

1158
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,120
I can sense your presence, you know.

1159
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:09,960
The next time I sense you, this child will...

1160
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,240
This child will die.

1161
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,100
Remember that.

1162
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,480
Oh my god.

1163
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:16,880
Okay.

1164
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,360
I'm just obsessed with you.

1165
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,060
All right.

1166
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:23,920
We're leaving.

1167
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:30,270
Pardon me, little lady.

1168
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,260
Oh, recently I discovered VTubers and I love your streams.

1169
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,140
Really?

1170
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,500
Thank you so much.

1171
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:42,200
Thanks, dude.

1172
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,860
Thanks for the super chat.

1173
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,240
Like soinks mint.

1174
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,600
We gotta get out of here.

1175
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,340
Raggy.

1176
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,100
All of a sudden, I'm left behind alone.

1177
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:00,260
Alone in the room that stole that little lady's smile away five years ago.

1178
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,380
The little lady is gone now.

1179
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,240
Leaving me with only a few new facts.

1180
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,100
A few very heavy, very sad facts.

1181
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,320
Does Lynn know about all this?

1182
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:14,280
Raggy.

1183
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,560
One other thing stands out in my mind.

1184
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,180
I can sense your presence.

1185
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,200
The sum of that kidnapper's final words.

1186
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,000
Do those two know?

1187
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:30,160
Do the kidnappers know about the powers of the dead?

1188
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,100
Would you spare the girl for a Scooby Snack?

1189
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,640
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1190
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,480
Yay!

1191
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,900
Cleared the 1225 challenge.

1192
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,640
It's crazy that all of this happens in just like 15 minutes.

1193
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,340
Oh my gosh, Camilla is so cute.

1194
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,240
Continue playing?

1195
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,020
Of course.

1196
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,760
I don't know what chapter we're on now.

1197
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:58,440
Oh.

1198
00:54:58,780 --> 00:54:59,440
Chapter 12.

1199
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:02,900
Yeah.

1200
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,780
40 minutes late.

1201
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,680
Now I feel so lost.

1202
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,200
I can catch you up.

1203
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:07,880
Um.

1204
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:09,920
Uh.

1205
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:10,420
Here.

1206
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,120
Read this.

1207
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,020
Hold on.

1208
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,040
Uh.

1209
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:16,900
Hold on.

1210
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:17,360
I'm gonna eat.

1211
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,240
You read it.

1212
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,500
Someone read it out loud.

1213
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,360
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1214
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,300
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1215
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:51,010
Welcome to Why You're Stuck Here.

1216
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:53,430
All your earthly possessions now belong to retowards.

1217
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:54,990
You've missed your chance to run.

1218
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:56,010
Blah.

1219
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:01,800
Thanks for your super time.

1220
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:03,840
I'm glad.

1221
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,240
Am I glad she's trapped in there?

1222
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,440
Now we're trapped in there.

1223
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,820
And that she's the daughter.

1224
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,200
And that we're trapped in there.

1225
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:12,940
And now we're in there.

1226
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,300
And I just remembered we're out here.

1227
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,680
What I want to know is where's Ms. Camilla?

1228
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,380
Thank you.

1229
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,960
What do you call a ghost dad?

1230
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,200
A transparent.

1231
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:26,760
It's transparent.

1232
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,880
Get it?

1233
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:31,920
It's transparent.

1234
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,400
It's a ghost.

1235
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,120
Looks like the kidnappers made a big mistake.

1236
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,400
The girl in the trunk...

1237
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,140
Oh, thank you.

1238
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:44,160
You literally sent a super chat?

1239
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,580
You sent a super chat of...

1240
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,660
Of what's on the screen.

1241
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:52,980
Okay, I'll read it.

1242
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,560
It looks like the kidnappers made a big mistake.

1243
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:01,900
You said to read it out loud.

1244
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:02,980
Okay, sorry.

1245
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:03,320
Hold on.

1246
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:03,940
Let me take a sippy.

1247
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,400
Okay.

1248
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,700
It looks like the kidnappers made a big mistake.

1249
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,680
The girl in the trunk was Detective Zhao's daughter Camilla.

1250
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,280
Not the minister's daughter.

1251
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,920
Oh, what is going on here?

1252
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:22,740
What are you guys doing?

1253
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:28,140
When I got back to the justice minister's office, things were getting even more out of hand.

1254
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,480
The devastated man was being grilled by the fiery detective lady.

1255
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,460
Thanks for the money.

1256
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,360
Oh, that's what she's doing.

1257
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,520
She's going off on him.

1258
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,780
I told Lin what I found out about the kidnapping.

1259
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,960
That it wasn't the justice minister's daughter who had been abducted.

1260
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:52,490
That the kidnappers had been holed up in Camilla's old house.

1261
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:54,990
And that they sensed my presence and were already gone.

1262
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:57,130
This is a good recap of what just happened.

1263
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:00,130
I hope this caught you up.

1264
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:03,210
But Camilla, why do they have Camilla?

1265
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:06,210
Her father isn't the stupid old justice minister.

1266
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,730
I think the stupid old part is a little uncalled for.

1267
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:13,770
Looks like the kidnappers made a mistake somehow.

1268
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:18,590
The poor girl kidnapped for the ransom of her own father's execution.

1269
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,990
That is actually...

1270
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:23,150
I did not think about that.

1271
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:24,710
That's actually really messed up.

1272
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:28,430
That's actually so messed up.

1273
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:31,670
I missed the last stream.

1274
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:33,810
How long did it take Min to get past the minister's puzzle?

1275
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:34,750
I don't remember.

1276
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:38,570
I think about each chapter has taken me like an hour or so.

1277
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:40,710
Or a little longer.

1278
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:42,070
I also talk.

1279
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:44,750
But this is really messed up.

1280
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,250
It's just too much.

1281
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,790
It's a cruel twist of fate.

1282
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:49,450
I agree.

1283
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:51,410
That just ain't right.

1284
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:54,570
And then there are those other twists too.

1285
00:58:54,570 --> 00:59:00,990
Like the kidnappers winding up in and using Camilla's old house as their hideout.

1286
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:03,990
There's no way it could be just a coincidence.

1287
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:06,690
And them sensing my presence.

1288
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:09,450
They seem to know about the powers of the dead.

1289
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:12,310
I just don't understand any of it.

1290
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:15,270
Think you're generally decently quick?

1291
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:16,150
Yay!

1292
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:17,070
Thank you.

1293
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:19,990
I told you before, detective.

1294
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:22,110
I want you to stand back.

1295
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:23,550
Bam!

1296
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:24,910
Bam!

1297
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:26,790
Minus one HP.

1298
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:27,690
Minus one HP.

1299
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:28,450
Minus one HP.

1300
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:31,250
Who cares about distance at a time like this?

1301
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:32,870
Look, Mr. Minister.

1302
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,130
It wasn't your daughter that was kidnapped.

1303
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:39,410
Don't try to pretend you didn't hear what we were saying.

1304
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:44,410
How can I believe in you?

1305
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:45,610
I'm a realist.

1306
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:47,350
Please!

1307
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:48,490
Minus one HP.

1308
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:52,070
If you don't believe what we said, see for yourself.

1309
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:53,910
Just call home and...

1310
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:56,410
I tried calling a hundred times.

1311
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:57,750
My wife won't answer.

1312
00:59:58,950 --> 00:59:59,810
She won't?

1313
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:01,790
It's complicated.

1314
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:06,890
Why does life have to be such a complicated thing?

1315
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:08,750
I don't remember the voice I gave him before.

1316
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:12,090
And I feel like I remember Lin being British.

1317
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:14,270
But I think that was just a Mandela effect.

1318
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:19,450
But if she doesn't answer, doesn't that mean everything's normal?

1319
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,050
It doesn't prove it.

1320
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:24,830
And everyone knows ghosts aren't real.

1321
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:27,170
Why would you say that?

1322
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:29,930
Why would you say that?

1323
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:39,250
Excuse you.

1324
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:42,990
And I'm being watched.

1325
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:45,210
I can't have the police go check for me.

1326
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:50,550
Besides, if the execution isn't carried out tonight, the hostage will be killed.

1327
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:53,590
What difference does it make that it's not my daughter?

1328
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:56,950
I guess that's kind of true.

1329
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:01,270
That's quite a pickle, Mr. Minister.

1330
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:03,110
Quite a pickle.

1331
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:03,590
Oh, my God.

1332
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:07,350
Here comes... the Elvis guy.

1333
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:11,270
I forgot his name.

1334
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:13,590
Miss me, baby?

1335
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:16,750
Oh, Inspector Cavandela!

1336
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:18,910
I thought it was a pasta.

1337
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:21,650
It was carbonara, but it didn't seem right.

1338
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:25,250
He's so cool.

1339
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,530
I have a little rapport for you, Mr. Minister.

1340
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:38,370
Oh my goodness!

1341
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:42,710
If you guys don't bow that deep when you greet me...

1342
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,600
The escaped prisoner has been apprehended.

1343
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,300
Thought you might like to see him, so here he is.

1344
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:55,680
Wait, he's here?

1345
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,280
Oh!

1346
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,300
Come on in!

1347
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,540
Oh my god!

1348
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,280
He's just here!

1349
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,380
Detective Jowd?

1350
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,220
Detective Jowd, I'm so sorry.

1351
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:09,460
I tried.

1352
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,060
I'm a nerd.

1353
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,140
You think I can bend like that?

1354
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,120
Start!

1355
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:16,800
Start!

1356
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,200
Start stretching!

1357
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,340
Wilson Channel, welcome to the membership.

1358
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:22,080
Thank you!

1359
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,180
I know that you're innocent.

1360
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:26,140
I just can't prove it.

1361
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:28,560
I'm so sorry.

1362
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:38,700
Lin, please, don't apologize to me.

1363
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,560
The reason I don't give him a voice is I think he's just too cool for... I can't do it justice.

1364
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,600
You know?

1365
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:48,280
Ah, the beautiful love between a teacher and student.

1366
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:50,080
It brings a tear to my eye.

1367
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,540
Trick time!

1368
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:55,620
Trick time!

1369
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,760
Oh, what are they saying?

1370
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:01,780
You knew, didn't you, Inspector Carbonara?

1371
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:04,160
That the execution was tonight.

1372
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:07,680
It's the Giga Chen.

1373
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:09,160
Give him snake voice?

1374
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:14,460
I was planning to dogeza for the meet and greet, but alas.

1375
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:15,340
Ah, man.

1376
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,240
It's okay.

1377
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:16,980
I'm the maid.

1378
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,200
I have to be bowing to you.

1379
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,600
You guys don't bow to me.

1380
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,140
I bow to you guys.

1381
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,580
I bow to you guys.

1382
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:27,160
You're just wisps.

1383
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,560
You're all goshijinsama and ojo-sama wisps.

1384
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:53,230
Sorry, I was drooling.

1385
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:57,350
I don't believe I had any obligation to tell you.

1386
01:03:57,690 --> 01:03:58,610
What a jerk.

1387
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:00,210
And you're fine with this?

1388
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,790
I mean, you know as well as I do.

1389
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:07,390
Detective Child could never have done such a thing.

1390
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:12,350
No, come on, baby.

1391
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:14,470
I know no such thing.

1392
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:15,090
Huh?

1393
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:19,550
I know two things.

1394
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:23,410
Every time I elongate his words, I want to say it like a sheep.

1395
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:27,530
I know two things to be true and two things only.

1396
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:30,950
One, he was given the death penalty.

1397
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:34,230
And two, he tried to escape.

1398
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:37,590
What else could I do but haul him in, baby?

1399
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,390
But he's an innocent man!

1400
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:44,170
If that's the case, why did you bring him here?

1401
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:47,250
Whatever do you mean, young lady?

1402
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:49,950
He escaped from prison, right?

1403
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:52,610
So why didn't you just take him back to the prison?

1404
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:56,730
I think you only brought him here...

1405
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:59,210
...to brag about your accomplishment.

1406
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,150
Isn't that right, Inspector?

1407
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:06,050
Elvis sheep.

1408
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:11,110
With all these cool character voices, have you ever considered being a dungeon master?

1409
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:16,290
I don't... I've never ever once had the thought.

1410
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:19,210
For your own selfish reasons?

1411
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:20,710
Oh yes, call him out!

1412
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:21,290
Call him out!

1413
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:24,090
This guy's a jerk.

1414
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:28,190
So were all those rumors about you true?

1415
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:31,290
That the only thing you care about is a spotless record?

1416
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:35,190
Is that more important to you than saving a friend?

1417
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:37,310
Shots.

1418
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:44,770
Everybody has certain principles they can't go back on.

1419
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:46,110
Including me.

1420
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:48,810
You'll understand that someday, baby.

1421
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:53,810
I don't like him.

1422
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:55,670
That's enough, Lin.

1423
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:56,910
Oh.

1424
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:58,490
Talked like a snake, right?

1425
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:00,090
But Detective Jowd!

1426
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:02,330
I'm a death...

1427
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:03,130
It doesn't fit him!

1428
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:08,330
I'm a death row inmate who escaped from prison.

1429
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:09,450
It doesn't fit him!

1430
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:11,790
It doesn't fit him at all!

1431
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:14,390
This is how it should be.

1432
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:17,170
But... but...

1433
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:18,610
The instant phone.

1434
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:20,590
Oh,

1435
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:25,530
a ghost!

1436
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:29,450
No, I don't want to talk to you.

1437
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,260
Oh my god, we can talk to everybody here.

1438
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,040
It's kinda crazy.

1439
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,580
You know what, we'll start with this guy.

1440
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:47,720
My poor Amelie.

1441
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:48,900
Is she alright?

1442
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:51,620
Actually, the girl who was kidnapped is named...

1443
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:52,160
Camilla.

1444
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,480
Why is a dream talking to me in my head again?

1445
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:57,700
Wait a minute.

1446
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:58,460
Amelie?

1447
01:06:59,320 --> 01:06:59,800
Wait.

1448
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:02,220
They all can communicate?

1449
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:04,100
They can all go into the death area together?

1450
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:05,500
Interesting.

1451
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:08,380
Could that be the Amelie next door?

1452
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,780
Yes, I think so.

1453
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,540
Wow, I didn't know the justice minister lived next door.

1454
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:16,860
No, not me.

1455
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:17,620
My wife.

1456
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:19,500
It's... complicated.

1457
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:21,800
Yeah, I bet it was.

1458
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,940
That would be pretty hard to admit she...

1459
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:27,040
Wait, there's no secrets in the ghost world, Sissel?

1460
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:29,640
Ghost Skype.

1461
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,440
Sissel.

1462
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,680
He never learns.

1463
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:37,500
Actually, you know what?

1464
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:38,860
Let everybody know.

1465
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,880
The minister's wife ran away on him?

1466
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:53,460
Why was she so happy about that?

1467
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,740
Yo, is this Professor Layton versus Ace Attorney?

1468
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,320
Yes.

1469
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:08,420
Maybe they grew apart.

1470
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:09,760
What, with him being so busy?

1471
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,660
Yeah, I bet you're right.

1472
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:16,560
Please stop gossiping about me inside my own head!

1473
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:22,600
According to what I heard...

1474
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,620
Amelie was supposed to go to some sort of lesson tonight.

1475
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:29,900
Those horrible kidnappers!

1476
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,660
They were lying in wait for her!

1477
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:34,460
But Amelie didn't go out after all.

1478
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,560
She couldn't.

1479
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,700
She had a fever.

1480
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:39,280
Huh.

1481
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,840
And so the kidnappers grabbed Camilla by mistake instead?

1482
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:44,340
Apparently.

1483
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:46,820
Amelie and Camilla are about the same age.

1484
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:47,680
Hmm.

1485
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:51,060
The kidnappers must have gotten the two of them mixed up.

1486
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:54,800
It's my fault.

1487
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:58,020
If I hadn't asked Camilla to do that errand for me...

1488
01:08:58,020 --> 01:08:59,300
This never would have happened.

1489
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:01,080
Oh, right.

1490
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,780
You asked her to bring the music box.

1491
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:05,360
Camilla...

1492
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,120
Aww.

1493
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:07,260
It's not your fault!

1494
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:09,020
It's not your fault.

1495
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,420
Alright, let's go talk to Jowd.

1496
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,700
So, Mr. Ghost, we meet again?

1497
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:15,860
I hear something happened.

1498
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,220
Something about a kidnapping.

1499
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,280
It's your daughter!

1500
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:23,520
Some kidnappers are saying they abducted the Justice Minister's daughter.

1501
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:25,920
That's terrible.

1502
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,120
What's their demand?

1503
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,640
The carrying out of your execution.

1504
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:32,940
Tonight.

1505
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:34,860
Hahaha!

1506
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,880
I had no idea I was so hated.

1507
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,480
But the Minister doesn't have to worry.

1508
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:43,320
I die and it's all over.

1509
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:44,340
Very simple.

1510
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:46,220
No, what about your daughter?

1511
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:49,060
It's not that simple!

1512
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:50,700
Why not?

1513
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,240
Because it isn't really the Minister's daughter who got kidnapped.

1514
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,280
It's Camilla!

1515
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:00,180
You just spat food all over my...

1516
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:05,620
If you could choose to someone's life with...

1517
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:05,800
Wait.

1518
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:06,640
Choose to what?

1519
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:08,280
With ghost trick.

1520
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:11,880
But in exchange, they could hear what you think when you talk to them.

1521
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:13,500
What would you do, ghost man?

1522
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,060
What?

1523
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:16,380
Like save someone's life with the ghost trick?

1524
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:19,760
Yeah,

1525
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:34,410
save.

1526
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:41,680
But like what if the death is like really interesting?

1527
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:43,560
Really creative.

1528
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:44,960
Kind of like the death contraption.

1529
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,320
Can we hear your thoughts?

1530
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,440
What would you want to hear, huh?

1531
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,540
What would you...

1532
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:58,940
What do you think that I think in my head that I don't say out loud 99% of the time?

1533
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:03,800
What do you think that I'm thinking about?

1534
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:04,600
Snake.

1535
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:06,300
Lewd thoughts.

1536
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:08,240
My...

1537
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,640
Exactly my point.

1538
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:13,400
What do you think that I'm thinking about that I do not say 90...

1539
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:14,080
You know what?

1540
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:14,560
I'll even...

1541
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,240
I might drop it a little.

1542
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:16,760
95% of the time.

1543
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,800
I have nothing to lose, man, with young daughter.

1544
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:23,660
I know, right?

1545
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:30,830
Nerd stuff.

1546
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:33,770
You know deep down that you're actually cute.

1547
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:37,630
I wish...

1548
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:39,850
I wish I could agree with you there.

1549
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:47,440
I wish I could agree with you there.

1550
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:54,560
Anyway.

1551
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:55,940
Camilla.

1552
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,400
I checked it out for myself.

1553
01:11:58,780 --> 01:11:59,560
I'm positive.

1554
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,360
No, it can't be.

1555
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,540
And by the way, Camilla told me something interesting.

1556
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:11,400
She said the one who killed her mother five years ago was Camilla herself.

1557
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:12,100
Oh.

1558
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:13,800
What?

1559
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,340
What are you talking about?

1560
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,200
Don't listen to him.

1561
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,340
I'm the one who shot her.

1562
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,720
I'm the one who shot Alma.

1563
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:25,300
And when I'm executed tonight, that will be the end of it.

1564
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,980
Camilla won't have to suffer anymore after tonight.

1565
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:32,160
She's suffering because she was a baby.

1566
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:34,920
What do you think she's going to get the death penalty?

1567
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,960
This guy is so backwards.

1568
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:41,540
For a capable detective, you say some incredibly misguided things.

1569
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:42,980
Yeah, her dad is going to die.

1570
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,180
That means her dad and her mom are going to be dead.

1571
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,140
How is that going to end her suffering?

1572
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:50,620
This guy is so stupid.

1573
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:03,580
You dying isn't going to end that girl's suffering.

1574
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,720
It'll just bring her new suffering.

1575
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,980
The only person's pain this execution is going to ease is yours.

1576
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,640
Do you think the lamp was the mom?

1577
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,600
The lamp at the very beginning?

1578
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:31,340
But also, facts, Sissel, facts.

1579
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:35,060
Do you think the lamp... do you think the mom is what protected...

1580
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:40,160
Is what protected Camilla from dying before?

1581
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:48,960
That's what I was thinking.

1582
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,660
Great minds, great minds.

1583
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:54,600
But I'm just cooking.

1584
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,300
No confirming or denying.

1585
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,520
We're cooking together, everybody.

1586
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:00,300
Is this true?

1587
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,660
What Camilla said?

1588
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:05,480
Why don't you tell us what you know?

1589
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,900
The murder five years ago.

1590
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:13,080
To be honest, I still don't understand what happened that day.

1591
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:15,740
It was my wife's... almost birthday.

1592
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:18,560
The lamp is me.

1593
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,540
I'm the game.

1594
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,020
I believe you, Beancake.

1595
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:22,840
Quake.

1596
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:24,740
Sorry, Beanquake.

1597
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,700
We came home from work.

1598
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:29,920
And she went in first.

1599
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,260
Oh yeah, that's true.

1600
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,820
She did die a long time ago.

1601
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:36,200
And he said that... or the lamp said...

1602
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:37,460
That...

1603
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,360
You only get...

1604
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,120
But what if that's not actually the case?

1605
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:45,680
What if that's not actually the case?

1606
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:46,760
What if the lamp lied?

1607
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,460
What if the lamp lied so that...

1608
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:53,080
So... so that...

1609
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,240
We would solve the case tonight.

1610
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:56,880
So that we would have a motive.

1611
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,160
Because the lamp seemed to know a lot.

1612
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:05,120
But if they were only around for a little bit of time...

1613
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,660
They wouldn't know so much.

1614
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,660
What if the lamp is the mom trying to save the dad?

1615
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:17,710
Because she knows that it wasn't him.

1616
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:21,430
Why would a lamp lie?

1617
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:32,910
I looked for the shooter, but there was nobody to be found.

1618
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:35,590
There was nobody there besides Alma and Camilla.

1619
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:36,750
Just the two of them.

1620
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:39,970
So the little lady's mother died right in front of her.

1621
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:40,790
I'm so sad.

1622
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:44,690
That's so horrible.

1623
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:50,460
Camilla told me about it.

1624
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:51,460
She was crying.

1625
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:55,680
The lamp has grandpa voice though.

1626
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:56,840
You're so right.

1627
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:58,300
What was I thinking?

1628
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,800
The lamp's a grandpa.

1629
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:00,000
Grandpa?

1630
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,420
I have a big question though.

1631
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:05,420
Who is Sissel?

1632
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:05,940
I know.

1633
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:06,820
We still don't know.

1634
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:09,600
But we have to get to the music box.

1635
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:10,740
And then we'll figure it all out.

1636
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:15,180
She said the contraption she made did something it wasn't supposed to.

1637
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,980
Made an impossible move.

1638
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:19,560
An impossible move.

1639
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:21,120
I love...

1640
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:21,740
You know what?

1641
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:24,060
Maybe Sissel needs the snake voice.

1642
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,260
Since he talks like snake.

1643
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:28,380
The powers of the dead.

1644
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,020
It's been five years since then.

1645
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:32,620
I stopped thinking about it.

1646
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,020
I shot Alma.

1647
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:35,480
There's no other explanation.

1648
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:37,700
That's what I'd convince everyone of.

1649
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:38,780
Even me.

1650
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:44,320
But tonight, you showed up and gave me an explanation I never would have thought of before.

1651
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,980
The powers of the dead, right?

1652
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:53,120
That day in that room, powers that I didn't understand were at work.

1653
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,780
And if that's the case, it clears up...

1654
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,500
All the mysteries.

1655
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,480
So a ghost?

1656
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,040
That doesn't save lives, but kills lives!

1657
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:07,480
Oh my god!

1658
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:13,550
An evil ghost!

1659
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:17,910
Maybe not all.

1660
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,890
There are a couple of other people who know about those powers.

1661
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:26,130
Is somebody there?

1662
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:27,670
Can you hear me?

1663
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:30,330
I can sense your presence, you know.

1664
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:34,610
The kidnappers...

1665
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:36,230
The kidnappers knew...

1666
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:39,490
Wait, the kidnappers who abducted Camilla knew about those powers.

1667
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:44,210
This is no ordinary kidnapping.

1668
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:48,250
It looks like my wife's case isn't coming to an end after all.

1669
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:50,590
I'm the only one who thought it was.

1670
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:51,450
Yeah!

1671
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:52,890
Liquid Sissel!

1672
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:55,090
Detective Jowd.

1673
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:57,810
There's still time before dawn.

1674
01:17:58,050 --> 01:17:58,930
A little, anyway.

1675
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:02,670
How about you see this case through to the end before you die?

1676
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:09,150
I only know one other ghost.

1677
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:09,950
Mint.

1678
01:18:10,210 --> 01:18:11,930
What have you been up to on the side?

1679
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:24,840
A little...

1680
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,900
Kind of like, you know, a little...

1681
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,160
This and that.

1682
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:32,620
Right and left, up and down.

1683
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:34,540
Hmm...

1684
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:36,880
That sock that went missing last week?

1685
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:40,560
On the dark web.

1686
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:41,700
Being sold.

1687
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,520
You know, that cake you were saving?

1688
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,720
That disappeared all of a sudden?

1689
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:56,040
Yeah, you ate it.

1690
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,700
But I possessed you when you did.

1691
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:00,640
Officer, there's a ghost right here.

1692
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,900
No, no, no!

1693
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,300
I'm innocent.

1694
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:07,540
No, no, no, no!

1695
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,260
I'm innocent, I promise.

1696
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,400
I didn't do a thing!

1697
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:13,600
I didn't...

1698
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,060
This wasn't me.

1699
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,820
It wasn't me.

1700
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,580
An impossible move.

1701
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,520
Camilla was a quiet little girl.

1702
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,000
But she was good with her hands.

1703
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,440
She was a little genius.

1704
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:31,400
Hahaha.

1705
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,420
She's a little genius!

1706
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:38,880
No!

1707
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,500
Don't put me next to the police!

1708
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,120
Of course it wasn't!

1709
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:06,780
It was supposed to be a surprise for her mother's birthday!

1710
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:11,820
And the other strange point was the movement of that cupid.

1711
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:14,140
Yeah,

1712
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,240
the paupers were supposed to go...

1713
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:28,060
It was supposed to shoot its arrow without turning around.

1714
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:29,760
Why did it turn around?

1715
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:36,700
Just like that!

1716
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:37,620
Maybe!

1717
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:43,460
Maybe we avoid having contraptions with using fire, you know?

1718
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:45,260
And that girl's name?

1719
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,480
Albert Einstein.

1720
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:53,560
Somebody made a change to the contraptions design and then manipulated it.

1721
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,460
I don't know what to say!

1722
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,580
I didn't have time to think things through then.

1723
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,420
All I knew was I had to protect Camilla.

1724
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,860
I made a small adjustment to the scene and turned myself in.

1725
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,220
Adjustment to the scene?

1726
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:15,760
What kind of an adjustment?

1727
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:17,780
The gun, of course.

1728
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:19,320
The gun, eh?

1729
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,300
Come to think of it.

1730
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:23,920
Oh yeah, I was missing!

1731
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,860
There was no gun there.

1732
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,380
Just a picture hanging on the wall.

1733
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:32,240
Of course not.

1734
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,580
Because I secretly switched the gun out of that frame with the picture.

1735
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,220
I didn't believe what she told me about her contraption.

1736
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:43,400
Why did you believe her?

1737
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,580
But one thing was for certain.

1738
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,800
That gun was still smoking.

1739
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:52,100
So that gun really did shoot Alma.

1740
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,180
I hid the gun before I went to the police.

1741
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:56,800
You hid it?

1742
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,740
I put it in a wooden box and gave it to a certain detective.

1743
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:03,320
Me?

1744
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:05,340
Or her?

1745
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:06,840
Wait, is it in the music box?

1746
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:09,340
You mean...

1747
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:13,910
She still thinks it's a music box!

1748
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:16,330
So that's...

1749
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:17,770
Oh my gosh, you just gave her a gun?

1750
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:18,550
Dang.

1751
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:20,950
So that's what was in the box, huh?

1752
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:25,610
I got a different murder weapon ready to give to the police.

1753
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:27,170
My own pistol.

1754
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:29,790
And I did a few other... but...

1755
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:31,910
No, that doesn't make any sense.

1756
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:37,910
If you give your own pistol to the police, the bullets wouldn't match up.

1757
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:39,730
You said it was an antique gun.

1758
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:41,630
That's the evidence that you need!

1759
01:22:42,410 --> 01:22:44,150
The bullets wouldn't match up!

1760
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:52,760
Keep reading.

1761
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:53,460
Read his line.

1762
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:57,080
Oh, and I did a few other things to make it look good.

1763
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,720
I won't go into the details.

1764
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,000
When I was all done, I turned myself in.

1765
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:04,560
Oh, he said that it matched.

1766
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:05,180
Oh, he did?

1767
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:06,060
Wait.

1768
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:07,560
Huh?

1769
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,460
Maybe he shot the corpse?

1770
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:20,500
Oh, he did a few other things.

1771
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:20,960
Huh?

1772
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:25,140
That's... what?

1773
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,760
That's... that's...

1774
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,140
How could you?

1775
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:38,400
How could you?

1776
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:45,320
Like, even if someone...

1777
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,440
Even if someone were dead...

1778
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:52,400
If they were like my husband or wife, I wouldn't be able to reshoot them at all.

1779
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:53,180
What?

1780
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:53,620
What?

1781
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:01,780
Oh my god.

1782
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,980
So anyway, I started blasting.

1783
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:06,420
Oh my god.

1784
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:09,720
When I was all done, I turned myself in.

1785
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:17,070
Wowee.

1786
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:17,950
That...

1787
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:18,730
That's...

1788
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:19,850
That's...

1789
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:21,190
That's a lot.

1790
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:23,930
Damn, I thought I was onto something too.

1791
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:24,870
I was just like...

1792
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:26,010
Damn it, Detective Jowd.

1793
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:27,890
Why did you have to be so thorough?

1794
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:30,270
I was like, just go find the bullet.

1795
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:30,850
It'll be fine.

1796
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:33,390
Damn it.

1797
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,030
Detective Jowd, is what you told us just now true?

1798
01:24:45,530 --> 01:24:46,050
Hmm.

1799
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:50,750
Yes, of course.

1800
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:55,750
In that case, there's still time.

1801
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:57,530
Still time?

1802
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:01,390
Time to solve the case that started five years ago.

1803
01:25:04,130 --> 01:25:05,910
You didn't do it, Detective Jowd.

1804
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:08,030
And of course, little Camilla didn't do it either.

1805
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:12,130
So the true perpetrator is still out there.

1806
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:13,610
And I'm going to prove it.

1807
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:15,730
For Camilla's sake.

1808
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,260
That sounds wonderful.

1809
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:28,740
Yeah!

1810
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:30,800
He's on our side now.

1811
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:34,200
Thank you, Detective Jowd.

1812
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,280
Lin, where is that music box now?

1813
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,320
In Temsik Park.

1814
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,440
Camilla left it there.

1815
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:41,660
Wait.

1816
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,440
Don't just yell this out to everybody.

1817
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,040
We don't know who we can trust.

1818
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,800
That gun is important evidence.

1819
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,180
You'd better go pick it up.

1820
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,240
Don't just tell everybody.

1821
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:53,260
Yes, sir.

1822
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:54,320
I'll go right now.

1823
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,240
Cecil, take care of Detective Jowd.

1824
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:03,120
And do something about the kidnapping so we can get the minister on our side.

1825
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:08,020
And yet again I say, easy enough for you to say.

1826
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:11,440
Uh.

1827
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,180
Is he...

1828
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:12,940
Is anybody...

1829
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:15,020
Are they not going to be like, oh, what the...

1830
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:15,500
What was that?

1831
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:18,680
What's going on?

1832
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,960
Deal me the deal, Mr. Deathrow and mate.

1833
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:22,280
Hmm.

1834
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:24,500
A little change in plans.

1835
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:27,360
My daughter has been kidnapped.

1836
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,780
I can't just go off to die without doing something.

1837
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:34,760
But you're in our custody.

1838
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:35,960
Don't forget it.

1839
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:41,180
Back at the prison, everybody's waiting for you with a special seat just for you, bebe.

1840
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,000
Then I guess we'd better prove my innocence.

1841
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:46,280
Oh, you're trying to prove my innocence on the double?

1842
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:48,340
On the double, is it?

1843
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:51,140
You sound so determined, my old friend.

1844
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:52,800
Hmm.

1845
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:56,940
I want to save Camilla in more ways than one.

1846
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:58,080
Yeah!

1847
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:00,100
And that's all there is to it.

1848
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:02,040
Didn't the chair blow up?

1849
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:02,460
It did.

1850
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:03,780
The chair did blow up.

1851
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:04,860
So what are they going to do now?

1852
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:07,340
Oh my God.

1853
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:09,480
They're going to put poison in the chicken.

1854
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,760
I see, my old friend.

1855
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,400
In more ways than one.

1856
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:15,000
You're going to get it.

1857
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:22,220
What say you, Mr. Minister?

1858
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:23,760
May we have your decision?

1859
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,760
Please, please, Mr. Minister.

1860
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:29,660
Should the execution be carried out tonight as planned?

1861
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:34,020
Or should we hold off and wait for this important evidence to come in?

1862
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:37,540
It's not your daughter!

1863
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:40,100
The order still stands.

1864
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:41,880
This guy sucks!

1865
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,940
We should have never saved him.

1866
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:47,800
Poison chicken.

1867
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:51,460
Bring the prisoner back immediately and resume its enforcement.

1868
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:54,480
No!

1869
01:27:57,470 --> 01:27:59,790
As you wish, Your Excellency.

1870
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:02,270
Oh, my God.

1871
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:04,470
Please don't bow down to me.

1872
01:28:04,890 --> 01:28:06,730
And especially not that low!

1873
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:14,910
In that case, can I have one of your... booze?

1874
01:28:16,350 --> 01:28:16,790
Boy!

1875
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:44,590
Arrange for a prison van to pick him up.

1876
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:46,770
Oh, my goodness.

1877
01:28:46,990 --> 01:28:48,250
I always have boo on the mind.

1878
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:50,230
Would you be so kind?

1879
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:51,310
Yes, sir!

1880
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:53,870
Where

1881
01:28:57,450 --> 01:28:58,290
did that come from?

1882
01:29:00,130 --> 01:29:01,610
Are you just going to stare at me?

1883
01:29:01,730 --> 01:29:02,610
What are you, obsessed with me?

1884
01:29:03,230 --> 01:29:05,470
The van should take about ten minutes, I'm guessing.

1885
01:29:05,870 --> 01:29:07,750
Your escape tonight was brilliant.

1886
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:13,550
Will you show me another miracle in these last few minutes of yours, Mr. Death Row inmate?

1887
01:29:16,490 --> 01:29:17,270
Thank you, Amelia!

1888
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:18,210
Thanks for a month!

1889
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:19,410
VTuber.

1890
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:21,470
Thank you!

1891
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:23,450
Let's see.

1892
01:29:24,290 --> 01:29:25,950
We got to show a miracle, huh?

1893
01:29:26,490 --> 01:29:28,750
Glad to see Detective Jowd all fired up now.

1894
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:30,730
I feel like I'm under the gun here.

1895
01:29:31,470 --> 01:29:37,450
Even if Lin does come through with the proof of Jowd's innocence, it will be meaningless if Jowd or Camilla dies.

1896
01:29:38,650 --> 01:29:40,890
I've got to do something about that kidnapping somehow.

1897
01:29:41,450 --> 01:29:44,190
Maybe I should ask for some advice from the capable detective here.

1898
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:48,750
Or... we spear him.

1899
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:52,050
Or we spear him.

1900
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:53,410
Let's go get inside this guy's head.

1901
01:29:53,850 --> 01:29:55,790
Um, excuse me, Mr. Minister?

1902
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:58,410
I'm going to haunt you until the day you die.

1903
01:29:58,410 --> 01:29:59,990
I can't hear you.

1904
01:30:00,110 --> 01:30:01,170
La la la la.

1905
01:30:04,270 --> 01:30:06,290
I'm sure you've heard everything we've been saying.

1906
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:09,230
Are you telling me you don't believe any of it?

1907
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:11,990
Let me speak plainly.

1908
01:30:12,010 --> 01:30:13,090
I don't trust you.

1909
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:15,590
But there's somebody else whom I trust even less.

1910
01:30:16,030 --> 01:30:16,690
Oh yeah?

1911
01:30:16,930 --> 01:30:17,530
Who's that?

1912
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:19,150
Me!

1913
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:21,130
I can't explain your existence.

1914
01:30:21,670 --> 01:30:22,570
It's not normal.

1915
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:24,590
But I'm pretty abnormal myself.

1916
01:30:25,310 --> 01:30:27,370
So maybe you're a figment of my imagination.

1917
01:30:27,370 --> 01:30:28,490
A delusion.

1918
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:29,970
Oh my god.

1919
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:31,350
The voices.

1920
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:34,430
Would you listen to a delusion?

1921
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:38,310
To be honest, I have no idea what you're talking about.

1922
01:30:39,630 --> 01:30:42,010
I got the bit about you not trusting me, though.

1923
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:43,590
Good.

1924
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,840
Most likely, the minister won't stop the execution.

1925
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,480
The voices.

1926
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,180
The lulu is the salulu.

1927
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:03,120
Not as long as there's any small chance his daughter is the one who was kidnapped.

1928
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:05,600
But she isn't the one.

1929
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:06,760
I'm sure of it.

1930
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,800
Well, it would be great if we could prove that to the minister.

1931
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:13,220
Prove it how?

1932
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:17,160
We have to get them to call.

1933
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,300
We have to get the wife to call him.

1934
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:23,620
I doubt his wife is ever going to answer that phone if we call from here.

1935
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:26,400
If we call from here, right?

1936
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:28,640
But a telephone works in both directions.

1937
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:30,280
Yes, yes, yes.

1938
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:32,420
What are you saying?

1939
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:36,480
What I'm saying is only family members can solve a family problem.

1940
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:38,360
Hey, Mr. Ghost?

1941
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:40,040
Yes?

1942
01:31:40,940 --> 01:31:43,420
I have to admit, I don't like depending on others.

1943
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,940
But you're the only one who can change the situation.

1944
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:48,900
Gee, detective.

1945
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:53,060
For these past five years, Camilla is the only thing that kept me going.

1946
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:55,740
I can't go meekly to the chair now.

1947
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:58,640
I hate to ask this.

1948
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:01,120
But would you mind saving me?

1949
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:05,240
I'll try.

1950
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:09,900
The key to getting the justice minister to stop the execution is his wife and daughter.

1951
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:11,140
But is there a way?

1952
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:12,680
Oh my gosh, we're going back to the lady.

1953
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:15,240
Wait, can I...

1954
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:18,580
No, it won't let me go anywhere else.

1955
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:18,860
Okay.

1956
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:22,180
Time to...

1957
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:24,460
Can I knock this off?

1958
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:28,620
This brave little water pitcher just saved the justice minister's life.

1959
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:31,060
He drank all of the water, so now it's empty.

1960
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:32,780
I think he should get it refilled.

1961
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:34,760
You never know when another fit may visit.

1962
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:35,600
So true.

1963
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,480
Hanging around here won't change anything.

1964
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,800
I've got ten minutes before the prison van shows up.

1965
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:44,740
If I could just do something about the kidnapping in those ten minutes...

1966
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:46,800
I guess the telephone lines are my only hope.

1967
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:47,960
Okay.

1968
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:52,000
Let's make it the best ten minutes of our lives, baby.

1969
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:55,980
Uh, lady's red apartment.

1970
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:00,800
Stay hydrated, everyone.

1971
01:33:10,430 --> 01:33:11,990
Just as I thought.

1972
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:17,370
This little girl is safe in her bed.

1973
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:20,770
Okay.

1974
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:24,710
She's so cute.

1975
01:33:25,190 --> 01:33:26,310
She reminds me of...

1976
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:27,130
Did I say this last time?

1977
01:33:27,190 --> 01:33:29,350
She reminds me of Beatrice from ReZero.

1978
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:30,430
Murder.

1979
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:31,490
Execution.

1980
01:33:31,850 --> 01:33:32,410
Jailbreak.

1981
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:33,110
Betrayal.

1982
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:33,690
And now kidnapping.

1983
01:33:33,690 --> 01:33:38,330
This last link in this long chain of a sad fate lit a fire in Jao's heart.

1984
01:33:38,510 --> 01:33:39,070
I did?

1985
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:46,030
And the chance to turn it all around is right here in this room.

1986
01:33:47,610 --> 01:33:48,550
You guys...

1987
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:50,770
If you ever think...

1988
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:54,510
If you ever think I'm not sincere...

1989
01:33:54,990 --> 01:33:56,630
I always think the same things.

1990
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:11,080
I always think the same things over and over again.

1991
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:22,770
I guess that was all we did.

1992
01:34:22,770 --> 01:34:23,330
Now enjoy some of your life.

1993
01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:24,830
Thank you.

1994
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:24,930
See you in another chapter.

1995
01:34:24,930 --> 01:34:32,930
I'm getting a strange premonition.

1996
01:34:33,290 --> 01:34:36,530
Everything that happened so far tonight has related back to me in some way.

1997
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:40,130
And I bet this mistaken ridden abduction does too.

1998
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:44,270
I'm so curious who Cecil is!

1999
01:34:45,990 --> 01:34:47,290
Oh that was the end of the chapter.

2000
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:49,070
Oh interesting.

2001
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:49,870
We just cleared all the chapter.

2002
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:50,850
I've got this illustration now.

2003
01:34:51,610 --> 01:34:54,250
Even though Cabanela is tall and lovely.

2004
01:34:55,970 --> 01:35:01,470
Well, one of those words describes him as definitely not tall.

2005
01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:05,650
Continue playing.

2006
01:35:06,990 --> 01:35:08,530
It's only been an hour and a half.

2007
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:12,350
That was a shorter chapter, wasn't it?

2008
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,460
I visited the novelist's apartment again.

2009
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:25,260
I'm hoping to be able to do something about this mistaken identity kidnapping.

2010
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:36,660
As long as there's any possibility that it could be his own daughter who was kidnapped, I doubt the justice minister will call off the execution tonight.

2011
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,880
I'm studying, so keep me company, Minto.

2012
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:41,000
I'll be here!

2013
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:49,700
The key to dispelling the minister's doubts is now in bed, coughing.

2014
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:52,940
And I need to use this key...

2015
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:57,820
And I need to use this key before that prison van arrives to pick up our death row inmate.

2016
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:02,490
Oh my god.

2017
01:36:02,650 --> 01:36:03,510
There she's back.

2018
01:36:04,230 --> 01:36:05,530
She's back, baby!

2019
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:11,190
This poor girl.

2020
01:36:11,570 --> 01:36:12,270
She's so sick.

2021
01:36:13,490 --> 01:36:15,110
My darling angel.

2022
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:17,030
Oh, just listen to that cough.

2023
01:36:17,850 --> 01:36:19,170
You naughty thing.

2024
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:21,530
Did you leave your nice warm bed here?

2025
01:36:21,550 --> 01:36:23,370
I wanted to go out into the night to play.

2026
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:26,290
A daughter after my own heart.

2027
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:30,030
But I must confess, I didn't even notice you were gone.

2028
01:36:31,230 --> 01:36:31,790
Ding!

2029
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:35,810
That's... that's not anything to brag about.

2030
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:38,150
I didn't go out to play.

2031
01:36:38,610 --> 01:36:41,190
I went to buy Papa a birthday present.

2032
01:36:44,790 --> 01:36:46,870
He said he wanted a new lighter.

2033
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:49,610
Okay.

2034
01:36:50,450 --> 01:36:53,350
But that's no reason to go out this late at night.

2035
01:36:55,450 --> 01:36:57,550
But my fever finally went down.

2036
01:36:57,690 --> 01:36:59,350
I could barely move before that.

2037
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,780
But look what it brought you.

2038
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:09,840
Your fever is worse now than ever.

2039
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:14,720
Here is to the feverish passion of my darling angel.

2040
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:15,660
Ding!

2041
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:18,300
31st, bam!

2042
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:19,260
Welcome to membership.

2043
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:19,800
Thank you.

2044
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:20,920
Mama.

2045
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:22,300
Yes, darling?

2046
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,200
Let's call Papa and wish him a happy birthday.

2047
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:27,080
Even though it's already past midnight.

2048
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:28,680
Mama.

2049
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:29,540
Hmm...

2050
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:32,440
Not tonight, Amelie.

2051
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:34,600
Okay.

2052
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:36,320
I hate you!

2053
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:38,660
Mint coughing baby.

2054
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:40,260
Shut up!

2055
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:41,220
Shut up!

2056
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:42,480
Shut up, nanoplasm!

2057
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:42,900
Shut up!

2058
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:43,520
Shut up!

2059
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:49,240
I had the lady's voice stuck in my head all day after the last time you did it?

2060
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:49,580
OMG.

2061
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:56,340
It looks like this little girl was safe all along.

2062
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:57,860
I already knew that.

2063
01:37:57,860 --> 01:37:58,720
But I'm still relieved.

2064
01:37:58,980 --> 01:37:59,420
All the same.

2065
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:01,860
What did I do?

2066
01:38:02,380 --> 01:38:03,020
You!

2067
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:06,820
Don't turn my coughs into baby coughs.

2068
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:08,900
Don't turn my coughs into baby cough...

2069
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:10,080
baby cough...

2070
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:11,260
listening...

2071
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,700
listening files.

2072
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:16,200
You!

2073
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:19,800
There's another...

2074
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:21,720
another lucky development too.

2075
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:25,300
Amelie wants to call her father.

2076
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:27,840
Now if I can make use of that...

2077
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:29,140
that feeling somehow...

2078
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:32,840
that would surely bring the justice minister around.

2079
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:34,360
Wait, so that's a lighter right there?

2080
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:35,420
Do we have to just...

2081
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:40,660
light the shelf on fire and have it move the phone closer to her?

2082
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:42,520
Trick time!

2083
01:38:46,930 --> 01:38:47,730
Light it!

2084
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:54,980
Oh, easy!

2085
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:56,620
More arson!

2086
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:57,760
The phone!

2087
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:01,920
Don't look at...

2088
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:02,860
Oh, don't look!

2089
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:04,600
No, no, no, no, no!

2090
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:08,100
Hurry up!

2091
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:08,920
Call!

2092
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:14,280
Amelie, I told you you couldn't call him tonight.

2093
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,140
Why not?

2094
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:18,440
Listen to me, Amelie.

2095
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:21,300
Your father is about to make a big mistake.

2096
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:23,760
I want him to reconsider.

2097
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:27,740
What do you know about it, Mama?

2098
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:30,680
He's the one who's the justice minister, you know.

2099
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,960
All you do is write weird novels.

2100
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:38,120
I'm almost tired of it.

2101
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:43,960
What?

2102
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:49,240
What are you doing?

2103
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:52,120
Are you my sister?

2104
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:54,500
Who are you?

2105
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:55,800
Are you my big sister?

2106
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:56,180
Yes!

2107
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:57,080
And are you my boyfriend?

2108
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:09,700
No, don't call!

2109
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:12,060
How dare you expect me to forgive such an insult!

2110
01:40:16,230 --> 01:40:18,650
It's called hentai and it's an art.

2111
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:19,610
No!

2112
01:40:20,010 --> 01:40:21,670
I knew it wouldn't be so easy.

2113
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:24,610
No!

2114
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:30,730
She's working on milk farm too.

2115
01:40:31,110 --> 01:40:32,350
Let her cook then!

2116
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:46,270
I can hear you, you know.

2117
01:40:51,110 --> 01:40:52,390
What a pair.

2118
01:40:52,950 --> 01:40:55,690
I don't know what this family's issues are.

2119
01:40:55,870 --> 01:40:59,430
But I do know I have to do something about this lady so Amelie can call.

2120
01:41:02,110 --> 01:41:02,590
Fire!

2121
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:04,230
Fire!

2122
01:41:04,470 --> 01:41:05,530
Set it on fire!

2123
01:41:07,910 --> 01:41:09,690
Okay, we have the wastebasket.

2124
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:13,450
Let's see.

2125
01:41:15,190 --> 01:41:15,750
Oh!

2126
01:41:15,850 --> 01:41:17,970
Are we gonna start an electrical fire?

2127
01:41:22,330 --> 01:41:24,050
Let's start an electrical fire.

2128
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:25,410
Awesome!

2129
01:41:26,910 --> 01:41:27,470
Okay.

2130
01:41:28,350 --> 01:41:29,150
Let's see.

2131
01:41:29,430 --> 01:41:30,550
What happens if I do this?

2132
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:37,560
Too... too what?

2133
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:41,220
Swing hard!

2134
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:42,040
Too weak!

2135
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:45,940
Look at him go!

2136
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,000
Well, I don't know what it's supposed to do though.

2137
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,300
Poor little guy.

2138
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:56,700
What does she say here?

2139
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:58,520
She coughs?

2140
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:04,600
Mama, what is Papa about to do?

2141
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:07,540
Never mind.

2142
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:09,940
Nothing you need to know right now, Amelie.

2143
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,920
Why is everything always such a big secret?

2144
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:14,880
I'm part of this family too, you know.

2145
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:17,600
It's not something for children's ears.

2146
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:19,120
You'll understand someday.

2147
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:21,980
I don't want to know someday.

2148
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:23,080
I want to know now.

2149
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:25,100
It's not fair.

2150
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:27,340
You just don't want to tell me.

2151
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:30,660
I just want to wish Papa a happy birthday.

2152
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,440
Not tonight.

2153
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:36,020
If it was up to me, I'd let her call him.

2154
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:37,420
Thanks, Cecil.

2155
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:38,840
How nice.

2156
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:39,860
How nice.

2157
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,840
If he swings harder...

2158
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:48,080
I don't know.

2159
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:48,620
Let's see.

2160
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:50,840
Let's go back up here.

2161
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:52,320
Turn this.

2162
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:54,440
Hoist.

2163
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:56,980
Turn that.

2164
01:42:58,200 --> 01:42:59,300
Examine the dictionary.

2165
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:01,940
The lady's dictionary.

2166
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,480
Wasn't this on her desk before?

2167
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:05,800
The poor thing.

2168
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,360
Destined to never be returned to the bookshelves.

2169
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:15,470
Hoist.

2170
01:43:22,010 --> 01:43:23,850
Return this valve.

2171
01:43:25,070 --> 01:43:26,350
Oh, make it chime.

2172
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:29,490
Bing bong.

2173
01:43:33,370 --> 01:43:34,490
Well, well.

2174
01:43:34,590 --> 01:43:37,070
Having a good time, are we, little rodent?

2175
01:43:37,950 --> 01:43:40,850
Yes, mommy.

2176
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:43,790
Sweet dreams.

2177
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:47,610
This poor guy...

2178
01:43:47,610 --> 01:43:47,790
Wait.

2179
01:43:49,130 --> 01:43:52,290
Did you fancy the vintage, my whiskered friend?

2180
01:43:53,130 --> 01:43:53,790
Ding.

2181
01:43:57,390 --> 01:44:01,630
But it moved over the lamp.

2182
01:44:01,710 --> 01:44:02,610
Or not the lamp.

2183
01:44:02,710 --> 01:44:03,270
The um...

2184
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:04,590
The chandelier.

2185
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:05,610
The sconce.

2186
01:44:05,850 --> 01:44:06,670
The sconce.

2187
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:09,650
She's more powerful than I thought.

2188
01:44:11,610 --> 01:44:13,350
It looks like she tipped the wall...

2189
01:44:13,350 --> 01:44:13,770
Oh.

2190
01:44:14,470 --> 01:44:14,950
Candelabra.

2191
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:18,390
A candelabra to one side too.

2192
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:19,170
Hmm.

2193
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:20,430
The angle of those candles.

2194
01:44:20,910 --> 01:44:24,830
I get the feeling I've seen something very similar to that quite recently.

2195
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:26,890
Yes, we have.

2196
01:44:31,290 --> 01:44:31,770
I

2197
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,200
better not put out the lamp right now.

2198
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:40,340
It will only pour oil on the flames of anger in this lady's heart.

2199
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:45,760
If I want to give Amelie a chance to use the telephone, I have to think of a way to keep her mother out of the way.

2200
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:53,590
So we turn the rat to the other side.

2201
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:55,350
And we get her to turn around.

2202
01:44:57,270 --> 01:44:58,070
Turn, turn, turn.

2203
01:44:58,290 --> 01:44:58,670
There we go.

2204
01:44:58,730 --> 01:44:59,010
Oh!

2205
01:44:59,730 --> 01:45:01,550
Oh my god, this poor rat!

2206
01:45:03,110 --> 01:45:04,470
No, this poor rat!

2207
01:45:04,610 --> 01:45:04,730
Oh.

2208
01:45:05,830 --> 01:45:06,390
Uh-oh.

2209
01:45:08,090 --> 01:45:11,390
Oh, heaven's a blackout at a critical time like this.

2210
01:45:12,290 --> 01:45:18,230
Of course, dim lights suit my story of love very well, but I myself am not very fond of the dark.

2211
01:45:20,470 --> 01:45:21,630
Is the rat okay?

2212
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:26,700
Oh!

2213
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:32,000
This chandelier just narrowly missed the back of my head.

2214
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:36,260
I love the thrill of romance, but I don't need these kinds of thrills.

2215
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:36,900
Thank you.

2216
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:42,180
I forgot that she lights it with her ass.

2217
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:44,140
Wow!

2218
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,280
She's gonna drink that?

2219
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:06,640
Ah, what a wonderful atmosphere.

2220
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:12,400
Perfect for a clandestine meeting in the dusky twilight.

2221
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:15,000
Trick time.

2222
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:16,860
Okay.

2223
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:24,760
I don't exactly know how this situation came about, but I think I owe that rat an apology.

2224
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:26,980
The rat seems to be unconscious.

2225
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:31,480
But now that the room has changed into this, maybe I can use it somehow.

2226
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:32,920
Yes.

2227
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,760
So the rat...

2228
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:41,740
If I crank this...

2229
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:41,880
Oh!

2230
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,220
My goodness, that scared me.

2231
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:48,320
What a naughty chandelier.

2232
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:50,520
Sorry, ma'am.

2233
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:51,300
So...

2234
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:52,780
Sorry, I'm so...

2235
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:53,840
I'm naughty.

2236
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,200
I'm a naughty chandelier.

2237
01:46:57,800 --> 01:47:00,260
If the rat died, you'd have to go back in time to save it.

2238
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:00,660
You're right.

2239
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:09,020
Can I open this?

2240
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:12,460
It doesn't do anything.

2241
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:24,420
I can't tell if I'm being timed here or not.

2242
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:26,320
You know?

2243
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:30,720
Swing harder?

2244
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:33,880
No.

2245
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:36,740
Hmm...

2246
01:47:42,230 --> 01:47:43,350
Burn brighter.

2247
01:47:45,310 --> 01:47:46,710
Wow.

2248
01:47:48,710 --> 01:47:52,210
We need to get something...

2249
01:47:52,210 --> 01:47:54,530
to swing on...

2250
01:47:57,010 --> 01:47:58,670
the clock, maybe.

2251
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:03,090
Um...

2252
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:06,660
Or...

2253
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:12,360
If I lower it...

2254
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:13,540
Hmm...

2255
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:18,860
The music is relaxing.

2256
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:20,480
It is kind of making me sleepy.

2257
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:21,140
I'm not gonna lie.

2258
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:22,900
If I turn this again...

2259
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:25,760
It doesn't do anything.

2260
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:26,980
The lights are out.

2261
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:28,280
So it doesn't really matter anyway.

2262
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:31,460
Um...

2263
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:36,810
Nothing there.

2264
01:48:40,870 --> 01:48:42,330
Something related to the dictionary?

2265
01:48:42,570 --> 01:48:43,230
Let's try it.

2266
01:48:43,610 --> 01:48:44,090
Okay.

2267
01:48:44,090 --> 01:48:44,390
Okay.

2268
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:46,710
The lady's dictionary.

2269
01:48:47,050 --> 01:48:48,090
Wasn't this on the disc before?

2270
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:48,790
Yup.

2271
01:48:48,830 --> 01:48:49,030
Nope.

2272
01:48:49,930 --> 01:48:52,370
And I can't reach anything over on the other side.

2273
01:48:52,430 --> 01:48:54,370
I don't think they have anything to do with it this time.

2274
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:06,580
Can I get her hair?

2275
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:08,760
When she leans back...

2276
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:09,360
Oh.

2277
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:09,780
Dang.

2278
01:49:13,490 --> 01:49:14,430
That was close.

2279
01:49:20,450 --> 01:49:20,890
Hmm...

2280
01:49:20,890 --> 01:49:21,190
Okay.

2281
01:49:21,310 --> 01:49:21,530
Okay.

2282
01:49:21,530 --> 01:49:21,810
Okay.

2283
01:49:21,810 --> 01:49:22,030
Okay.

2284
01:49:24,930 --> 01:49:25,750
Drop it!

2285
01:49:26,230 --> 01:49:26,870
Drop it!

2286
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:27,790
Drop it!

2287
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:28,050
Oh!

2288
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:30,810
It's okay.

2289
01:49:32,690 --> 01:49:33,310
It's okay.

2290
01:49:35,150 --> 01:49:35,630
It's okay.

2291
01:49:35,630 --> 01:49:35,890
It's okay.

2292
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:37,350
It's okay.

2293
01:49:37,670 --> 01:49:38,270
A little bit more.

2294
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:43,880
That was close too.

2295
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,540
I want to see what Cecil says about it.

2296
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:53,800
Ah...

2297
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:55,840
Twice she managed to dodge like that.

2298
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:58,040
Who knew she was such a dodging champion?

2299
01:49:58,700 --> 01:49:59,900
I'm starting to get annoyed.

2300
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:01,220
Let me try that again.

2301
01:50:01,380 --> 01:50:02,300
I'll get her this time.

2302
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:03,160
Okay.

2303
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:09,280
She's too good.

2304
01:50:09,820 --> 01:50:10,680
She is.

2305
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:18,180
And walk, walk, walk.

2306
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:18,520
Down!

2307
01:50:26,650 --> 01:50:27,570
Help me!

2308
01:50:37,390 --> 01:50:38,430
I'm sorry, mama.

2309
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:39,470
I'm too dizzy.

2310
01:50:39,630 --> 01:50:40,670
I can't get up.

2311
01:50:41,570 --> 01:50:43,410
I'm afraid I can't help you right now.

2312
01:50:48,660 --> 01:50:51,300
Here is to the weakness of my darling angel.

2313
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:52,620
Ding!

2314
01:50:56,410 --> 01:50:59,390
That chandelier is on there tighter than her wedding band.

2315
01:50:59,970 --> 01:51:01,730
She won't be able to escape on her own.

2316
01:51:03,370 --> 01:51:03,810
Okay.

2317
01:51:03,810 --> 01:51:04,250
Crank?

2318
01:51:06,710 --> 01:51:08,730
Oh my god, this is kind of messed up.

2319
01:51:08,850 --> 01:51:10,570
What is going on here?

2320
01:51:11,350 --> 01:51:12,130
Emily, look!

2321
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:13,230
Do you see this?

2322
01:51:13,390 --> 01:51:14,190
Help me, please!

2323
01:51:16,970 --> 01:51:18,470
Sorry, I'm too sick.

2324
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:19,750
I can't get out of bed.

2325
01:51:19,930 --> 01:51:21,050
What is going on?

2326
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:22,310
My head is...

2327
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:22,430
What?

2328
01:51:22,530 --> 01:51:23,810
No, she doesn't have a southern accent.

2329
01:51:23,930 --> 01:51:24,790
My head is spinning.

2330
01:51:25,090 --> 01:51:27,510
So I guess I'll just have to stay up there spinning too.

2331
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:30,550
Um...

2332
01:51:31,730 --> 01:51:32,090
Um...

2333
01:51:33,250 --> 01:51:36,290
Looks like this lady won't be going anywhere for a while.

2334
01:51:36,770 --> 01:51:38,510
Now the little girl can call her father.

2335
01:51:39,170 --> 01:51:41,390
Yeah, but we still have to get her to reach the phone.

2336
01:51:41,670 --> 01:51:43,230
The only trouble is she can't reach it.

2337
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:44,990
I guess I'll just have to deliver it to her.

2338
01:51:47,370 --> 01:51:47,730
Wait.

2339
01:51:48,890 --> 01:51:49,430
That's right.

2340
01:51:49,490 --> 01:51:50,530
The angle of those candles.

2341
01:51:50,530 --> 01:51:53,250
I saw something very similar just recently, didn't I?

2342
01:51:53,350 --> 01:51:53,850
Yeah, yeah.

2343
01:51:54,170 --> 01:51:57,650
So if I burn brighter...

2344
01:51:59,270 --> 01:52:00,630
Excuse me, ma'am.

2345
01:52:02,030 --> 01:52:03,110
Oh my god!

2346
01:52:05,250 --> 01:52:06,390
Okay, okay, okay.

2347
01:52:09,710 --> 01:52:11,670
And then... wait.

2348
01:52:12,890 --> 01:52:13,990
Swing harder?

2349
01:52:15,130 --> 01:52:16,070
Swing harder!

2350
01:52:16,610 --> 01:52:17,430
Swing harder!

2351
01:52:18,350 --> 01:52:19,710
Oh, it got the rat.

2352
01:52:21,070 --> 01:52:21,870
Oh, there we go.

2353
01:52:21,990 --> 01:52:23,590
I had a feeling that it might be the rat.

2354
01:52:25,450 --> 01:52:28,090
Now I really owe that poor rat an apology.

2355
01:52:28,570 --> 01:52:30,450
This might be a really good chance for me too.

2356
01:52:30,670 --> 01:52:31,970
I have to get that phone to Amelie.

2357
01:52:32,450 --> 01:52:32,870
Okay.

2358
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:33,610
Swing harder!

2359
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:34,330
Swing harder!

2360
01:52:36,630 --> 01:52:37,550
Oh my god.

2361
01:52:37,590 --> 01:52:38,490
This is chaos.

2362
01:52:38,650 --> 01:52:39,790
This is absolute chaos.

2363
01:52:40,970 --> 01:52:41,390
Arson!

2364
01:52:41,550 --> 01:52:41,970
Arson!

2365
01:52:42,110 --> 01:52:42,530
Arson!

2366
01:52:42,590 --> 01:52:42,990
Arson!

2367
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:47,250
There we go.

2368
01:52:48,610 --> 01:52:49,170
Mama!

2369
01:52:50,050 --> 01:52:54,170
What in the world is going on?

2370
01:53:02,610 --> 01:53:04,010
I think we're over it now.

2371
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:05,770
Everything is all good.

2372
01:53:06,190 --> 01:53:07,350
Oh my goodness.

2373
01:53:07,470 --> 01:53:08,370
Why was it so shaky?

2374
01:53:09,630 --> 01:53:11,770
Troy enters the room with pizza.

2375
01:53:15,370 --> 01:53:16,830
Literally that meme.

2376
01:53:17,110 --> 01:53:17,510
Yes.

2377
01:53:18,070 --> 01:53:19,110
Oh goody.

2378
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:20,650
Excuse me a minute.

2379
01:53:20,790 --> 01:53:21,890
While I call Papa.

2380
01:53:21,890 --> 01:53:22,670
Okay, Mama.

2381
01:53:22,990 --> 01:53:23,930
I'll only be a minute.

2382
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:33,920
Don't you dare, Amelie.

2383
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:36,300
Get me down.

2384
01:53:41,140 --> 01:53:42,140
Sorry, I'm getting...

2385
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:54,820
Hello, Papa.

2386
01:54:00,990 --> 01:54:01,350
Amelie.

2387
01:54:01,570 --> 01:54:03,210
You know what's kind of messed up about this situation?

2388
01:54:04,270 --> 01:54:04,630
Is...

2389
01:54:07,070 --> 01:54:07,710
You know...

2390
01:54:08,290 --> 01:54:09,570
It's kind of like what he said.

2391
01:54:12,050 --> 01:54:13,910
Even if it's not his daughter that's been kidnapped.

2392
01:54:14,710 --> 01:54:16,170
There's still a daughter.

2393
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:17,330
Or still someone that...

2394
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:19,090
Still a young girl that has been kidnapped.

2395
01:54:19,710 --> 01:54:20,230
That...

2396
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:21,690
The...

2397
01:54:21,690 --> 01:54:21,970
The...

2398
01:54:21,970 --> 01:54:22,410
The...

2399
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:24,930
The ransom is the death of the guy.

2400
01:54:25,230 --> 01:54:26,310
But he's just like...

2401
01:54:26,310 --> 01:54:27,530
Well, it's not my daughter.

2402
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:28,330
So...

2403
01:54:28,330 --> 01:54:30,290
I guess it doesn't matter if she dies.

2404
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:34,930
Is that you?

2405
01:54:36,010 --> 01:54:37,430
Of course it is, silly.

2406
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:38,690
What did you think?

2407
01:54:39,370 --> 01:54:40,330
But I heard...

2408
01:54:40,330 --> 01:54:41,550
They said you were...

2409
01:54:44,350 --> 01:54:44,870
Your mother.

2410
01:54:44,870 --> 01:54:46,990
No, never mind.

2411
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:47,730
It's nothing.

2412
01:54:48,410 --> 01:54:49,410
Silly old Papa.

2413
01:54:50,250 --> 01:54:51,470
Happy birthday, Papa.

2414
01:54:52,290 --> 01:54:52,810
Birthday?

2415
01:54:52,990 --> 01:54:53,650
Oh, right.

2416
01:54:53,850 --> 01:54:55,530
It was my birthday today, wasn't it?

2417
01:54:55,930 --> 01:54:58,010
I'm sorry we couldn't celebrate tonight.

2418
01:54:59,090 --> 01:55:00,550
Thanks to mean old Mama.

2419
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:06,280
What's even sadder is this rat's life.

2420
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:08,820
Oh, your mean old Mama.

2421
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:09,900
I mean, your mother.

2422
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:11,360
What is she up to right now?

2423
01:55:11,460 --> 01:55:12,560
Oh, she's up all right.

2424
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:39,980
Let's put her on the天王 .

2425
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:43,580
Okay, goodから when you're to come back again.

2426
01:55:43,580 --> 01:55:44,360
I respect you.

2427
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:44,400
You must help us.

2428
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:45,500
Always dreams of the future.

2429
01:55:46,580 --> 01:55:47,180
And I can imagine what we will see all through the light on Heaven's Day.

2430
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:50,640
And the night that she breaks away is just都是 Yo,

2431
01:55:54,180 --> 01:55:58,600
I thought this was a blind play through.

2432
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:00,280
I don't know...

2433
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:01,880
This game is just Mint Coated.

2434
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:03,340
I don't know what else to tell you guys.

2435
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:03,640
OK.

2436
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:05,220
It's the end.

2437
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:08,100
This game is a mint if your name shows up in the credits.

2438
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:11,540
It's just extremely mint-coded, okay?

2439
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:17,520
Oh, you need to stop doing this.

2440
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:18,420
It's not funny anymore.

2441
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:18,960
I'm scared.

2442
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:20,060
I'm scared too.

2443
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:22,680
Maybe this is the ghost trick all along.

2444
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:25,700
Okay, so welcome back.

2445
01:56:25,700 --> 01:56:26,400
Thank you in hybrid.

2446
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:27,160
Welcome back.

2447
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:27,960
Stop reading.

2448
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:28,640
I'm not reading.

2449
01:56:29,060 --> 01:56:30,960
Real Ace Attorney fan.

2450
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:31,680
It's true.

2451
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:37,580
Oh man.

2452
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:39,900
Ghost to ghost communication.

2453
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:47,060
My stubborn mother is kind of tied up at the moment.

2454
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:50,280
Get me down.

2455
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:54,000
She needs to be taught a lesson for causing us so much trouble.

2456
01:56:57,140 --> 01:56:58,060
Angelic Descent.

2457
01:56:58,120 --> 01:56:58,760
Welcome to membership.

2458
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:00,380
Mint, are you the lamp?

2459
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:05,320
No, Amelie.

2460
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:06,900
Is it you?

2461
01:57:06,980 --> 01:57:07,700
Are you the baddie?

2462
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,280
I'm the one who was wrong.

2463
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:12,440
Hey, what's in the sand?

2464
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:13,460
Is that the script?

2465
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:19,620
You could have lived if you played this game within four minutes of your own death.

2466
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:20,220
And you're right.

2467
01:57:22,780 --> 01:57:24,840
Could you tell your mother I'm sorry?

2468
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:28,080
What do you have to be sorry about?

2469
01:57:28,660 --> 01:57:29,980
Can I have the lottery numbers?

2470
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:35,200
If you're Shu Takumi, can we have another Edgeworth game?

2471
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:40,720
I was just about to make a terrible mistake.

2472
01:57:41,940 --> 01:57:43,080
But it's all right now.

2473
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:45,780
Oh my god, his face all of a sudden.

2474
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,460
Oh, he's actually kind of handsome.

2475
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:50,240
Oh, okay.

2476
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:52,480
You're still young.

2477
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:54,720
There's a lot I can't tell you right now.

2478
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:58,480
The job of justice minister is very complicated, you see.

2479
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:01,160
Yeah, he lost all of his wrinkles instantly.

2480
01:58:02,860 --> 01:58:03,340
Okay.

2481
01:58:03,340 --> 01:58:08,440
But just remember, you're always the most important thing to your mother and me.

2482
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:13,820
Did you do something naughty to your mother?

2483
01:58:13,940 --> 01:58:15,720
If you did, I want you to apologize.

2484
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,260
I don't think I did anything.

2485
01:58:18,740 --> 01:58:20,380
But okay, I'll apologize.

2486
01:58:21,220 --> 01:58:22,320
That's a good girl.

2487
01:58:23,180 --> 01:58:23,880
Okay, Papa.

2488
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:24,840
Have a good night.

2489
01:58:24,940 --> 01:58:25,740
I love you.

2490
01:58:26,380 --> 01:58:27,880
I love you too, Amelie.

2491
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,140
Have a good night, sweetheart.

2492
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:31,680
And that was that.

2493
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:36,560
Maybe I should call the police.

2494
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:39,220
Uh, Mama?

2495
01:58:40,740 --> 01:58:41,580
I'm sorry.

2496
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:44,620
My goodness, why the sudden change?

2497
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:47,740
I guess I was wrong about you.

2498
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:48,860
I didn't understand.

2499
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:51,220
Oh, Amelie.

2500
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:53,560
Yeah, and the fire department.

2501
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:57,480
I thought all you ever did was write these weird novels.

2502
01:58:58,260 --> 01:58:59,900
That makes me a little sad.

2503
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:03,500
Papa said the job of justice minister was complicated.

2504
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:06,880
Yes, your father's job is very, very complicated.

2505
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:08,100
And difficult.

2506
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:11,300
That's why I couldn't talk to you about most of it.

2507
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:13,540
If you're right...

2508
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:14,780
But you're right.

2509
01:59:15,140 --> 01:59:18,100
I shouldn't treat you like such a little girl anymore.

2510
01:59:18,380 --> 01:59:19,840
You're growing up, after all.

2511
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:25,980
And I promise to stop calling your novels weird and try to actually read...

2512
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:27,880
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2513
01:59:28,180 --> 01:59:29,100
Don't read them.

2514
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:30,380
What?

2515
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:34,300
Oh, maybe you'd better wait until you're a little older for that.

2516
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:37,480
Okay.

2517
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:43,940
So, Amelie, if you're feeling a little more charitable toward your old mama, do you think you could let me down now?

2518
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:46,280
You know, I would love to do that.

2519
01:59:46,820 --> 01:59:49,680
But I'm just feeling too dizzy and sick right now.

2520
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:52,920
Oh...

2521
01:59:56,920 --> 02:00:00,960
Tonight, on this holiest of nights, my deadline...

2522
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:05,200
It looks like the only thing pressing on me will be this chandelier.

2523
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:08,420
Here's to Papa and Mama's darling angel.

2524
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:09,440
Ding!

2525
02:00:14,210 --> 02:00:17,090
That thing is so... it's so... what's the word?

2526
02:00:17,670 --> 02:00:19,110
It's so sturdy.

2527
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:20,370
It's holding her up so well.

2528
02:00:21,270 --> 02:00:23,610
All of a sudden, everybody is getting along again.

2529
02:00:23,890 --> 02:00:25,270
It's such an abrupt change.

2530
02:00:25,430 --> 02:00:26,430
I can't understand it.

2531
02:00:26,930 --> 02:00:28,810
Is this what family is all about?

2532
02:00:30,650 --> 02:00:31,770
In any case...

2533
02:00:31,770 --> 02:00:33,690
The situation has changed dramatically now.

2534
02:00:33,850 --> 02:00:38,910
I just hope the mysteries of me can be cleared up as quickly as the furrows on the minister's brow.

2535
02:00:39,970 --> 02:00:41,670
I wish I was that chandelier.

2536
02:00:42,230 --> 02:00:46,390
Punpun, you keep... you keep... you keep dreaming, you know?

2537
02:00:47,530 --> 02:00:48,950
Never let go of that dream.

2538
02:00:50,090 --> 02:00:53,570
Think about how you want to be the chandelier in this very moment.

2539
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:55,390
And never let go of that feeling.

2540
02:00:56,350 --> 02:00:57,170
Thank God.

2541
02:00:57,510 --> 02:00:58,950
If only...

2542
02:00:58,950 --> 02:01:06,150
If only I were the chandelier tightly... tightly grasping a grown woman's waist.

2543
02:01:06,930 --> 02:01:09,270
Her bosom too big to fit through.

2544
02:01:09,510 --> 02:01:13,350
Her bottom too big as well.

2545
02:01:13,590 --> 02:01:16,230
Just keep thinking about that as your dream.

2546
02:01:17,350 --> 02:01:19,090
Just keep thinking about it.

2547
02:01:20,950 --> 02:01:22,250
And never let go.

2548
02:01:22,990 --> 02:01:24,050
Because that...

2549
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:26,190
is what dreams are made of.

2550
02:01:32,300 --> 02:01:33,780
I don't know where Camilla is.

2551
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:36,420
At least now the justice minister's doubts are dispelled.

2552
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:39,920
I think I'll go back to his office where everybody is waiting for the prison mat.

2553
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:40,920
Uh-oh.

2554
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:43,320
Don't tell me we got there and he already got picked up.

2555
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:50,720
Never let go of the bosom or the bottom.

2556
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:53,100
Be the chandelier.

2557
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:55,000
I'll toast to that.

2558
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:55,780
Amen!

2559
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:02,360
Top and bottom's big because they're filled with our dreams.

2560
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:04,260
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

2561
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:07,140
Mint, I'm stuck in my dreams!

2562
02:02:09,260 --> 02:02:09,740
Dream.

2563
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:10,580
Keep dreaming.

2564
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,300
Don't let go of the dreams.

2565
02:02:12,720 --> 02:02:13,820
Just keep living.

2566
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:14,880
Live.

2567
02:02:15,140 --> 02:02:15,880
And dream.

2568
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:19,440
The minister's family now has their smiles and harmony back.

2569
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:21,980
But Camilla is still in the hands of the kidnappers.

2570
02:02:22,140 --> 02:02:24,260
I decided to go back to the justice minister's office.

2571
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:26,820
Oisha.

2572
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:30,580
Surprisingly, the minister's brow is still just as furrowed as ever.

2573
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:34,300
Quite unlike a father who has just learned his daughter is safe.

2574
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:36,480
He seems to still be in the depths of despair.

2575
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:41,260
The atmosphere in this room is very different now.

2576
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:43,540
It seems to have an air of unfocused anxiety.

2577
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:46,800
I get the feeling something big is about to happen.

2578
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:56,820
I just found out that my daughter is safe.

2579
02:02:58,280 --> 02:03:00,000
I'd like to express my gratitude.

2580
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:01,640
Thank you.

2581
02:03:01,880 --> 02:03:03,360
Thank you for my daughter's sake.

2582
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:04,220
And for mine.

2583
02:03:05,980 --> 02:03:06,620
Thank you.

2584
02:03:06,620 --> 02:03:07,360
Oh, ha, hoo, hey.

2585
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:10,280
No need to thank us, Mr. Minister.

2586
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:11,400
It was nothing.

2587
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:12,880
You didn't do anything.

2588
02:03:13,960 --> 02:03:15,240
What did he do?

2589
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:20,800
But one question, I can't help but notice.

2590
02:03:20,980 --> 02:03:22,420
Your daughter is safe.

2591
02:03:23,740 --> 02:03:26,040
And yet, you still look unhappy.

2592
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:28,540
How about a little smile for us?

2593
02:03:29,140 --> 02:03:29,780
Ahh.

2594
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:32,340
Of course.

2595
02:03:32,340 --> 02:03:35,820
Worse, there is still the matter of the other kidnapping victim.

2596
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:41,180
But is that really the only thing that troubles you, Mr. Minister?

2597
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:50,460
Please, let me think in peace until the prison van arrives.

2598
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:51,240
What?

2599
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:53,980
No, no, no!

2600
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:55,240
Come on, man!

2601
02:03:57,080 --> 02:03:59,200
I wonder if Lynn is at the park yet.

2602
02:03:59,380 --> 02:04:01,660
Until we get her report, I guess we'll just have to wait here.

2603
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:04,220
This continued distress of the ministers...

2604
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:08,280
Is there really something more to it, like the inspector in white said?

2605
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:09,760
Yeah, let's see what he says now.

2606
02:04:10,580 --> 02:04:12,300
Oh, because also...

2607
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:16,220
Is he probably getting blackmailed by the blue people or something, you know?

2608
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:25,480
Hold on.

2609
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:33,220
Hello, Justice Minister.

2610
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:37,600
How about you finally admit I do exist?

2611
02:04:39,160 --> 02:04:40,540
That thank you I expressed.

2612
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:42,140
That was meant for you.

2613
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:46,380
You're a ghost, aren't you?

2614
02:04:46,820 --> 02:04:49,540
And you have the power to control and manipulate people, don't you?

2615
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:51,960
No, I don't have that kind of power.

2616
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:53,220
I can't control you.

2617
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:55,960
Ghost?

2618
02:04:58,120 --> 02:05:01,400
We've actually known you, you know, for quite a while now.

2619
02:05:01,980 --> 02:05:05,020
But I had no idea they were the powers of the dead.

2620
02:05:05,180 --> 02:05:06,060
Of ghosts.

2621
02:05:06,940 --> 02:05:07,380
Known?

2622
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:08,380
Wait, known about what?

2623
02:05:11,120 --> 02:05:14,760
We knew about the existence of somebody who could control others.

2624
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:16,760
A manipulator?

2625
02:05:18,380 --> 02:05:19,040
What's this?

2626
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:23,380
That's why your execution order caused me so much anguish, Detective Jowd.

2627
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:25,140
Mr. Minister.

2628
02:05:26,180 --> 02:05:28,180
Why don't you just tell us everything you know?

2629
02:05:28,340 --> 02:05:29,860
Is that why they're in the special prison?

2630
02:05:31,660 --> 02:05:35,780
Is everybody in the special prison affected by these manipulating cases?

2631
02:05:38,620 --> 02:05:40,900
So they might be innocent, but like...

2632
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:44,620
They were manipulated.

2633
02:05:52,550 --> 02:05:53,850
I suppose I should.

2634
02:05:55,810 --> 02:05:56,610
Thank you, Malia!

2635
02:05:56,750 --> 02:05:57,570
Thanks for the five gifted.

2636
02:05:57,630 --> 02:05:58,130
Thank you!

2637
02:05:59,190 --> 02:06:00,490
You need to hear it all.

2638
02:06:00,850 --> 02:06:03,290
All about the huge mistake this foolish man made.

2639
02:06:05,230 --> 02:06:05,670
Manipulator.

2640
02:06:07,170 --> 02:06:10,470
There are some cases in this country right now that are under attack.

2641
02:06:10,470 --> 02:06:11,270
A top -secret investigation!

2642
02:06:12,550 --> 02:06:15,110
Of course you wouldn't have known about them, Detective Jowd.

2643
02:06:15,610 --> 02:06:16,090
Right.

2644
02:06:16,230 --> 02:06:19,170
They don't share too much top-secret information with the inmates in prison.

2645
02:06:20,590 --> 02:06:24,230
There are three prisoners including you in the special prison you just escaped from.

2646
02:06:24,710 --> 02:06:26,990
All three cases have certain points in common.

2647
02:06:27,630 --> 02:06:28,770
They do, do they?

2648
02:06:28,950 --> 02:06:29,850
Tell us more.

2649
02:06:32,250 --> 02:06:33,350
I knew it!

2650
02:06:33,470 --> 02:06:36,950
The rock singer who leaked national secrets in his lyrics during a TV broadcast.

2651
02:06:42,740 --> 02:06:47,060
The curry-loving fellow who took the chief commissioner hostage at the Metro Police Department.

2652
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:50,400
Neither of these men had a motive for their crime.

2653
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:52,260
And both of their crimes were impossible.

2654
02:06:53,140 --> 02:06:53,620
Yeah!

2655
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:55,900
Impossible.

2656
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:57,440
Impossible.

2657
02:06:58,020 --> 02:07:01,520
The curry-lover had no way of knowing how to infiltrate the commissioner's office.

2658
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:04,940
And the rock singer had no way of knowing the national secrets he leaked.

2659
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:06,780
Sausage head.

2660
02:07:08,980 --> 02:07:13,420
The special investigation unit submitted an investigative report to me on them.

2661
02:07:13,700 --> 02:07:17,400
It concluded that these men's criminal acts were not of their own volition.

2662
02:07:19,640 --> 02:07:20,780
How could that be?

2663
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:27,820
The theory the unit came up with was the existence of a manipulator.

2664
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:31,120
A manipulator, huh?

2665
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,560
Ghost that saves lives and ghost that kills wives.

2666
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:41,360
That's when the special prison was established as a facility to research that theory.

2667
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:44,400
It would make sense then why she has the sixth sense, right?

2668
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:47,220
Because if they're working with the bad ghost...

2669
02:07:47,860 --> 02:07:53,140
If they're working with a bad ghost, she would have the ability to sense ghosts, you know?

2670
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:11,660
Sorry, I was chewing.

2671
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:20,500
That's when the special prison was established as a facility to research that theory.

2672
02:08:22,680 --> 02:08:23,420
Child's case.

2673
02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:26,080
Some unknown power has been at work.

2674
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:29,840
These past several years, Inspector Cabanela has been studying these cases.

2675
02:08:30,620 --> 02:08:31,860
He has, has he?

2676
02:08:34,020 --> 02:08:36,200
Manipulating somebody into committing a criminal act.

2677
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:38,200
According to the inspector...

2678
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:42,940
Wow, Joshua!

2679
02:08:44,100 --> 02:08:45,620
Firmly grasped the ghost.

2680
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,540
Thank you for the outcome so far!

2681
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:48,680
Thank you!

2682
02:08:48,780 --> 02:08:49,680
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2683
02:08:52,260 --> 02:08:53,260
Thank you so much!

2684
02:08:53,380 --> 02:08:54,260
I really appreciate it!

2685
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:58,880
The first case of its kind was a locked room murder involving our nation's best detective.

2686
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:03,340
Are you saying I was somehow manipulated?

2687
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:07,120
Or are you trying to say I was manipulated somehow into shooting Alma?

2688
02:09:08,140 --> 02:09:10,460
I appreciate the theory, but unfortunately...

2689
02:09:10,460 --> 02:09:13,000
I don't recall being controlled by anybody.

2690
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:17,260
It's just not possible to manipulate another's behavior like that.

2691
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:21,200
My powers certainly don't work on living creatures.

2692
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:25,600
That's what I thought when I first heard the theory, too.

2693
02:09:25,940 --> 02:09:30,160
However, I was seriously mistaken, and it proved to be a big mistake.

2694
02:09:31,900 --> 02:09:32,420
What?

2695
02:09:33,980 --> 02:09:36,160
Okay, the minister's mistake?

2696
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:40,300
You mentioned a mistake.

2697
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:41,820
Could you tell us about it?

2698
02:09:43,340 --> 02:09:45,700
I suppose everybody here has the right to know.

2699
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:47,000
All right, fine.

2700
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:47,900
I'll speak out.

2701
02:09:47,940 --> 02:09:52,560
Can you just... Inspector Cabanela is like sitting in this room in silence while they're probably all like...

2702
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:59,020
Locked in in this conversation in their brain.

2703
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:04,080
All right, fine.

2704
02:10:04,280 --> 02:10:07,180
I'll speak out loud so that Inspector Cabanela can hear this, too.

2705
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:08,040
Oh!

2706
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:09,460
Interesting, okay.

2707
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:11,580
Everyone's using codecs.

2708
02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:13,740
It's the go-deck!

2709
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:15,680
It's the go-deck!

2710
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:16,740
The ghost codec!

2711
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:21,400
There's something I'd like the two of you to hear.

2712
02:10:23,120 --> 02:10:24,960
It's about a mistake I made.

2713
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:33,700
Inspector Cabanela, when you first made that report about a manipulator, I'm afraid I didn't believe it at all.

2714
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:35,240
Impossible, I thought.

2715
02:10:38,260 --> 02:10:40,300
Perfectly understandable, Mr. Minister.

2716
02:10:41,320 --> 02:10:42,220
But I was wrong.

2717
02:10:42,420 --> 02:10:44,100
That kind of power does exist.

2718
02:10:44,100 --> 02:10:45,320
And I...

2719
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:49,860
I learned the truth of that first hand.

2720
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:53,600
What's this?

2721
02:10:55,480 --> 02:10:59,080
A month ago, I signed the order to carry out Detective Jowd's execution.

2722
02:10:59,960 --> 02:11:00,560
However...

2723
02:11:01,260 --> 02:11:03,740
That act wasn't of my own volition.

2724
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:07,300
I was being controlled.

2725
02:11:08,620 --> 02:11:09,220
What?

2726
02:11:11,020 --> 02:11:13,300
You never told me about this, Mr. Minister.

2727
02:11:24,470 --> 02:11:25,470
What's going on?

2728
02:11:25,570 --> 02:11:26,530
This document?

2729
02:11:26,770 --> 02:11:27,850
What am I doing?

2730
02:11:29,150 --> 02:11:31,430
No, I mustn't sign it!

2731
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:40,560
Why is he clapping?

2732
02:11:44,170 --> 02:11:44,990
What's going on?

2733
02:11:45,150 --> 02:11:45,930
Wait, did he sign it?

2734
02:11:46,090 --> 02:11:46,710
Oh, no!

2735
02:11:47,390 --> 02:11:49,650
Wait, don't deliver that document!

2736
02:11:52,670 --> 02:11:54,410
Oh, I guess he just doesn't listen to you.

2737
02:11:57,450 --> 02:11:58,610
That's when it started.

2738
02:11:59,290 --> 02:12:02,090
That's when all of my fear, despair, and suffering began.

2739
02:12:02,250 --> 02:12:03,470
Oh my god, he must be so paranoid.

2740
02:12:08,790 --> 02:12:10,770
Fear, despair, and suffering.

2741
02:12:15,910 --> 02:12:19,950
At the time, it didn't even cross my mind that I had been manipulated.

2742
02:12:20,870 --> 02:12:23,850
And my memory of the event was only hazy at best.

2743
02:12:24,570 --> 02:12:27,930
Hmm, so the memory of being manipulated doesn't clearly remain, eh?

2744
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:32,310
Signing execution orders is part of a justice minister's job.

2745
02:12:32,890 --> 02:12:36,790
At the time, I just thought my psyche was rebelling against the task.

2746
02:12:38,350 --> 02:12:40,430
Through this arm, I live.

2747
02:12:41,430 --> 02:12:43,250
But the next day, it dawned on me.

2748
02:12:43,490 --> 02:12:47,190
I remembered Inspector Cabanilla's report on the existence of a manipulator.

2749
02:12:49,430 --> 02:12:49,910
Oh...

2750
02:12:50,550 --> 02:12:53,470
As the Minister of Justice, I couldn't admit what had happened to me.

2751
02:12:55,690 --> 02:12:58,710
I only signed the execution order because I was being controlled.

2752
02:13:00,750 --> 02:13:01,790
Oh, sorry.

2753
02:13:02,110 --> 02:13:06,470
If something like that got out, this nation's judicial system would crumble.

2754
02:13:07,350 --> 02:13:10,750
Besides, I had no evidence to present that I had actually been controlled.

2755
02:13:14,210 --> 02:13:16,290
One month haunting, thank you!

2756
02:13:17,670 --> 02:13:20,410
So in the end, I couldn't admit to anybody what had happened.

2757
02:13:21,690 --> 02:13:22,830
Hmm, I suppose.

2758
02:13:22,830 --> 02:13:25,250
But it sounds like a bit of an excuse.

2759
02:13:26,190 --> 02:13:28,590
You should have at least told us, Mr. Minister.

2760
02:13:28,870 --> 02:13:29,450
You're lost.

2761
02:13:30,190 --> 02:13:31,330
Noir, thank you!

2762
02:13:31,490 --> 02:13:34,970
Sounds awfully familiar to the tale of someone eating cake with no memory of it, huh?

2763
02:13:36,470 --> 02:13:36,990
Um...

2764
02:13:37,690 --> 02:13:38,210
Uh...

2765
02:13:38,970 --> 02:13:39,490
Uh...

2766
02:13:40,510 --> 02:13:41,030
Um...

2767
02:13:43,070 --> 02:13:43,590
Anyway...

2768
02:13:44,570 --> 02:13:45,530
Next question.

2769
02:13:48,430 --> 02:13:49,470
Psycho Ventus...

2770
02:13:49,470 --> 02:13:51,390
Oh my gosh, Joshua, thank you for the ping!

2771
02:13:52,130 --> 02:13:52,870
Thank you!

2772
02:13:52,990 --> 02:13:53,850
Cool guy, welcome back!

2773
02:13:53,910 --> 02:13:54,270
Thank you!

2774
02:13:55,710 --> 02:13:56,130
Yes.

2775
02:13:56,130 --> 02:13:56,930
Yes, I know.

2776
02:13:57,010 --> 02:13:57,610
I should have.

2777
02:13:57,850 --> 02:14:00,230
I was... running away from the problem.

2778
02:14:02,710 --> 02:14:03,550
Psycho Mantis...

2779
02:14:03,550 --> 02:14:05,450
His wife...

2780
02:14:06,010 --> 02:14:08,310
And then my wife found out I was worried about something.

2781
02:14:09,130 --> 02:14:12,310
Well, if you go around with an expression like that, I guess it's bound to happen.

2782
02:14:12,990 --> 02:14:14,210
I explained it to her.

2783
02:14:14,370 --> 02:14:16,790
She was dead set against the way I was handling it.

2784
02:14:18,650 --> 02:14:19,670
Oh, she has...

2785
02:14:19,670 --> 02:14:20,430
Whoa!

2786
02:14:20,430 --> 02:14:20,490
Whoa!

2787
02:14:21,390 --> 02:14:25,770
If you don't withdraw that order and tell everybody the truth immediately, I'm moving out!

2788
02:14:27,370 --> 02:14:27,810
Ooh.

2789
02:14:28,510 --> 02:14:29,110
She's a...

2790
02:14:29,110 --> 02:14:30,570
She's a feisty woman.

2791
02:14:31,130 --> 02:14:33,290
And then, with the kidnapping tonight...

2792
02:14:33,970 --> 02:14:36,430
With it thrust under my nose like that, I could make...

2793
02:14:36,430 --> 02:14:37,890
No longer deny my mistake.

2794
02:14:42,160 --> 02:14:42,740
What's this?

2795
02:14:42,820 --> 02:14:44,480
Some mysterious force has my wallet!

2796
02:14:47,080 --> 02:14:48,180
Evan, welcome back.

2797
02:14:48,300 --> 02:14:49,300
Sit down, thank you for the super chat.

2798
02:14:49,300 --> 02:14:52,380
This manipulator comes upon us from somewhere unsafe.

2799
02:14:53,240 --> 02:14:55,600
That's why I've been keeping my distance from everybody.

2800
02:14:56,980 --> 02:14:59,240
So that's why you've been telling people to stay back.

2801
02:15:03,380 --> 02:15:06,160
So there's somebody else besides me with the powers of the dead.

2802
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:07,380
I'm fine with that.

2803
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:10,240
After all, I already knew about a certain desk lamp.

2804
02:15:10,940 --> 02:15:11,420
Yeah...

2805
02:15:12,020 --> 02:15:16,320
What I'm not fine with is the fact that person can control and manipulate living creatures.

2806
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:18,600
That's certainly not something I can do.

2807
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:20,040
Yeah...

2808
02:15:21,960 --> 02:15:24,400
Apparently, different ghosts get different ghost tricks.

2809
02:15:25,620 --> 02:15:28,580
See, I just don't have the correct ghost trick, you guys.

2810
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:33,360
I just don't have the correct ghost trick.

2811
02:15:35,340 --> 02:15:36,740
It couldn't be me.

2812
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:42,800
But I never imagined that tonight, I would find out where this kind of power comes from.

2813
02:15:43,480 --> 02:15:44,660
Where it comes from.

2814
02:15:46,620 --> 02:15:47,140
Ghosts.

2815
02:15:47,660 --> 02:15:48,720
Inspector Cabanela.

2816
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:51,260
This manipulator is a ghost.

2817
02:15:51,480 --> 02:15:52,760
A departed spirit.

2818
02:15:53,060 --> 02:15:54,220
A specter!

2819
02:15:54,740 --> 02:15:55,720
A spirit?

2820
02:15:56,360 --> 02:15:59,500
As a matter of fact, there's a ghost talking to us right now.

2821
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:01,020
What?

2822
02:16:01,420 --> 02:16:02,500
What did you say?

2823
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:05,400
Chao, don't tell me you can hear this ghost too?

2824
02:16:08,600 --> 02:16:10,840
I'd say the only person who can't hear him is you.

2825
02:16:12,920 --> 02:16:13,440
Spirit.

2826
02:16:13,700 --> 02:16:14,220
Ghost.

2827
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:14,940
Gods.

2828
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:15,420
Heaven.

2829
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:19,080
Excuse me, Mr. Minister.

2830
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:21,300
I suddenly have some urgent business to attend to.

2831
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:24,380
That's kind of sussy, isn't it?

2832
02:16:26,260 --> 02:16:28,500
I'm being manipulated to send this super.

2833
02:16:28,640 --> 02:16:30,500
I can't control my actions.

2834
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:32,160
To Chonky, no!

2835
02:16:37,090 --> 02:16:40,890
I recommend you think long and hard before making your final decision, sir.

2836
02:16:43,250 --> 02:16:44,570
There he goes, trotting away.

2837
02:16:44,850 --> 02:16:46,310
He didn't even dance.

2838
02:16:48,370 --> 02:16:49,390
Is that Lin?

2839
02:16:53,030 --> 02:16:54,130
Hold on, I'm eating.

2840
02:16:54,310 --> 02:16:54,730
This is Lin!

2841
02:16:54,810 --> 02:16:55,330
I'm at the park!

2842
02:16:56,930 --> 02:16:57,730
Uh-oh.

2843
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:05,540
Lin's about to get kidnapped, isn't she?

2844
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:10,060
Lin's about to get kidnapped.

2845
02:17:11,140 --> 02:17:12,580
We've been waiting to hear from you.

2846
02:17:12,900 --> 02:17:13,960
Have you found the evidence?

2847
02:17:16,460 --> 02:17:20,520
Well, the situation here is kind of difficult to explain.

2848
02:17:21,360 --> 02:17:23,240
Sissel, if you're there, come to the park immediately!

2849
02:17:24,180 --> 02:17:24,580
Uh-oh.

2850
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:26,920
Well, somebody died!

2851
02:17:32,900 --> 02:17:35,160
It looks like your help is needed, Sissel.

2852
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:36,880
This is a normal Super Chat.

2853
02:17:37,020 --> 02:17:38,320
I am not being manipulated.

2854
02:17:38,760 --> 02:17:43,040
That's something someone being manipulated wouldn't say.

2855
02:17:44,280 --> 02:17:46,900
Someone being manipulated would say, I'm being manipulated.

2856
02:17:47,740 --> 02:17:50,540
But Wolfwood, you're definitely not being manipulated.

2857
02:17:52,820 --> 02:17:53,940
Yeah, I guess so, huh?

2858
02:17:55,300 --> 02:17:56,520
Let's go to the park!

2859
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:00,800
Meow, park.

2860
02:18:02,940 --> 02:18:03,420
Yippee!

2861
02:18:04,060 --> 02:18:05,200
I'm being manipulated.

2862
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:06,820
I'm being, I'm being manipulated.

2863
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:08,780
No, no, no, no.

2864
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:11,720
No, no, no, no, no.

2865
02:18:11,720 --> 02:18:13,740
I think the Chonky is onto something.

2866
02:18:13,880 --> 02:18:16,080
Your ghost trick is making us send mint-colored Supas.

2867
02:18:16,340 --> 02:18:16,820
Help!

2868
02:18:20,080 --> 02:18:21,800
Lynn calls and I oblige.

2869
02:18:21,900 --> 02:18:23,760
I take off towards Temsika Park.

2870
02:18:23,940 --> 02:18:27,160
The place where, clearly, something big is taking place.

2871
02:18:30,360 --> 02:18:31,320
Stay clean!

2872
02:18:31,460 --> 02:18:32,620
Thank you for the Aqua Supa!

2873
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:34,220
I am in full control of myself.

2874
02:18:34,480 --> 02:18:37,640
All my faculties are working without issue nor impediment.

2875
02:18:37,820 --> 02:18:39,700
The bank will not decline the payment request.

2876
02:18:39,700 --> 02:18:42,160
I will remember exactly what I've done with no regret.

2877
02:18:42,340 --> 02:18:45,120
There is no negative influence on my person at this moment.

2878
02:18:45,340 --> 02:18:46,600
I'm not playing King.

2879
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:48,680
Thank you for the Aqua Supa!

2880
02:18:49,060 --> 02:18:51,720
That totally was not manipulated out of you.

2881
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:53,780
Thank you!

2882
02:18:55,460 --> 02:18:56,680
The guards don't say anything.

2883
02:18:56,820 --> 02:18:58,040
They've been there all along for everything.

2884
02:18:58,260 --> 02:18:58,800
Are they deaf?

2885
02:18:59,580 --> 02:19:00,200
You know what?

2886
02:19:00,220 --> 02:19:00,940
Don't worry about them.

2887
02:19:01,380 --> 02:19:04,440
It's like the guards at, you know, the palace and stuff.

2888
02:19:04,560 --> 02:19:07,520
They're not allowed to, they're not allowed to, you know, interact.

2889
02:19:08,940 --> 02:19:09,680
It's like a...

2890
02:19:09,700 --> 02:19:10,920
It's like a person on a nature documentary.

2891
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:14,580
You just watch from the distance.

2892
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:15,800
Fukuro, thanks for the five gifted!

2893
02:19:16,300 --> 02:19:17,140
Stupid shark!

2894
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:18,400
It's happening here too!

2895
02:19:18,720 --> 02:19:19,420
Thank you!

2896
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:22,400
There must be a manipulator on every turn.

2897
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:24,640
Every time I turn on my gacha.

2898
02:19:25,380 --> 02:19:26,340
Oh, probably.

2899
02:19:26,780 --> 02:19:27,540
Oh my gosh, say that!

2900
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:32,060
Am I many pull lady?

2901
02:19:32,960 --> 02:19:34,820
No, no, I guess it works.

2902
02:19:34,980 --> 02:19:36,240
Min gacha or something.

2903
02:19:37,140 --> 02:19:40,760
Man, man, many, many pull lady.

2904
02:19:40,960 --> 02:19:42,260
I don't know that word.

2905
02:19:42,900 --> 02:19:44,280
Strange, too strange.

2906
02:19:44,560 --> 02:19:45,300
I'm sorry.

2907
02:19:45,640 --> 02:19:49,120
Sorry, I think I've missed so many words since I've been dead.

2908
02:19:49,300 --> 02:19:51,300
You know, my memory is kind of, you know.

2909
02:19:52,100 --> 02:19:53,400
Hayden, thanks for the five gifted!

2910
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:56,940
All right, let's go to Temsik Park, everybody.

2911
02:19:59,380 --> 02:20:00,340
The manipulator.

2912
02:20:00,520 --> 02:20:03,080
The person whose very existence sheds new light on everything.

2913
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:04,760
Detective Joud's crime.

2914
02:20:04,760 --> 02:20:06,100
The execution orders.

2915
02:20:06,220 --> 02:20:07,760
And even my own death.

2916
02:20:09,640 --> 02:20:10,340
Could it be?

2917
02:20:10,500 --> 02:20:13,300
Could Lin have been manipulated into shooting me?

2918
02:20:16,180 --> 02:20:18,480
I completely forgot that was an element!

2919
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:20,580
Oh my gosh!

2920
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:24,580
Oh my gosh, thank you guys for all the super chats.

2921
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:25,220
Thank you!

2922
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:28,780
Thank you guys.

2923
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:33,160
That song was called To Nothingness?

2924
02:20:33,420 --> 02:20:33,880
How many?

2925
02:20:34,020 --> 02:20:34,480
What chapter?

2926
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:34,940
What are we on?

2927
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:35,780
I can't remember.

2928
02:20:36,280 --> 02:20:37,000
Thirteen now?

2929
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:38,400
Fourteen!

2930
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:40,600
Fourteen out of...

2931
02:20:43,340 --> 02:20:45,000
Out of eighteen, right?

2932
02:20:46,840 --> 02:20:48,760
I wonder if I should just power through today.

2933
02:20:50,460 --> 02:20:52,440
I wonder if I should just power through today.

2934
02:20:57,280 --> 02:20:59,700
A system sending a message while resisting?

2935
02:20:59,940 --> 02:21:00,740
I'm being manipulated!

2936
02:21:01,460 --> 02:21:02,640
No, no, no.

2937
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:03,880
You wanted to send that!

2938
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:06,980
Nice progress.

2939
02:21:07,220 --> 02:21:07,660
Hmm.

2940
02:21:12,940 --> 02:21:14,300
Don't you have something big tomorrow?

2941
02:21:16,060 --> 02:21:16,700
Do I?

2942
02:21:18,740 --> 02:21:19,740
I don't think so.

2943
02:21:22,100 --> 02:21:23,400
Let me check my calendar.

2944
02:21:26,680 --> 02:21:27,160
Ope.

2945
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:28,320
I don't know what I just did.

2946
02:21:29,440 --> 02:21:30,300
Uh, no!

2947
02:21:31,320 --> 02:21:31,800
Wait.

2948
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:32,760
Tomorrow's Wednesday.

2949
02:21:33,140 --> 02:21:33,620
Okay.

2950
02:21:33,620 --> 02:21:33,860
Okay.

2951
02:21:35,240 --> 02:21:36,420
The rest is long.

2952
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:37,240
Hmm.

2953
02:21:39,040 --> 02:21:42,700
If I do four more chapters, one hour each about...

2954
02:21:43,320 --> 02:21:44,780
It'll be four more hours.

2955
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:45,820
What time is it?

2956
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:46,340
Hmm.

2957
02:21:46,400 --> 02:21:47,740
It might be into the middle of the night.

2958
02:21:50,940 --> 02:21:52,880
After this chapter is the best stopping point.

2959
02:21:53,020 --> 02:21:53,200
Okay.

2960
02:21:53,340 --> 02:21:54,540
I'm not being manipulated.

2961
02:21:55,080 --> 02:21:55,400
Ah!

2962
02:21:57,620 --> 02:22:00,060
Wait until after this chapter if you want to decide to finish.

2963
02:22:00,140 --> 02:22:01,980
The upcoming puzzle is probably the hardest in the game.

2964
02:22:02,060 --> 02:22:02,240
Oh!

2965
02:22:02,480 --> 02:22:02,920
Okay.

2966
02:22:03,260 --> 02:22:03,840
All right.

2967
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:03,980
Cool.

2968
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:04,200
Cool.

2969
02:22:04,260 --> 02:22:04,400
Cool.

2970
02:22:04,460 --> 02:22:06,680
Then we'll decide for this puzzle after.

2971
02:22:06,820 --> 02:22:07,100
Okay.

2972
02:22:08,300 --> 02:22:08,780
Okay.

2973
02:22:10,740 --> 02:22:11,540
Ghosted Nose.

2974
02:22:11,660 --> 02:22:12,340
What's the...?

2975
02:22:12,860 --> 02:22:13,340
Boo!

2976
02:22:16,100 --> 02:22:16,580
Boo!

2977
02:22:16,860 --> 02:22:18,880
What kind of stationery does a ghost use?

2978
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:20,560
Ghosted Nose!

2979
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:20,920
Boo!

2980
02:22:21,840 --> 02:22:22,320
Okay.

2981
02:22:22,380 --> 02:22:25,520
Maybe we'll do this chapter and then we'll save it for tomorrow?

2982
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:27,360
I could probably finish it tomorrow then.

2983
02:22:28,060 --> 02:22:28,880
Temsik Park.

2984
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:33,960
The site of the Little Lady Camilla's abduction tonight and the place where an important piece A piece of evidence.

2985
02:22:34,100 --> 02:22:35,180
The music box was hidden.

2986
02:22:40,780 --> 02:22:42,780
Oh wow, we're on the other side.

2987
02:22:43,020 --> 02:22:46,000
I wonder why our lady detective is looking so dejected.

2988
02:22:46,220 --> 02:22:47,500
At least she isn't dead.

2989
02:22:47,820 --> 02:22:48,960
But what did she find?

2990
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:53,120
Oh!

2991
02:23:01,510 --> 02:23:02,090
It's the chicken!

2992
02:23:02,690 --> 02:23:03,870
It's the... it's the...

2993
02:23:04,270 --> 02:23:04,530
Kitchen?

2994
02:23:04,810 --> 02:23:05,130
Chicken?

2995
02:23:05,190 --> 02:23:06,210
Chicken Kitchen Man!

2996
02:23:06,750 --> 02:23:07,790
What's he doing here?

2997
02:23:18,960 --> 02:23:23,000
A little late?

2998
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:24,340
It's already ice cold!

2999
02:23:24,820 --> 02:23:26,260
Oh my god, this guy sucks.

3000
02:23:31,420 --> 02:23:34,040
Oh, we have to wait for him to get closer to us.

3001
02:23:34,460 --> 02:23:35,200
There we go.

3002
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:36,840
Okay.

3003
02:23:37,880 --> 02:23:38,740
Swing harder!

3004
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:39,580
Swing harder!

3005
02:23:44,400 --> 02:23:45,000
Basketball?

3006
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:46,080
Oh, there's a basketball in there.

3007
02:23:46,240 --> 02:23:46,580
Globe.

3008
02:23:46,980 --> 02:23:47,620
Boot.

3009
02:23:48,840 --> 02:23:49,480
Leaflet.

3010
02:23:49,480 --> 02:23:50,120
Leaflet.

3011
02:23:50,580 --> 02:23:51,580
Love letter?

3012
02:24:00,060 --> 02:24:00,700
Leaflet.

3013
02:24:00,700 --> 02:24:01,340
Umbrella.

3014
02:24:09,420 --> 02:24:10,060
Rugby.

3015
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:12,400
Spin?

3016
02:24:22,850 --> 02:24:22,890
Ball.

3017
02:24:23,810 --> 02:24:24,650
Wait, there we go.

3018
02:24:25,430 --> 02:24:25,790
Seesaw.

3019
02:24:27,430 --> 02:24:29,210
Ooh, I got this thing spinning pretty fast.

3020
02:24:29,670 --> 02:24:31,270
I didn't even put much effort into it.

3021
02:24:31,550 --> 02:24:34,250
This is quite a bit of power and speed for a piece of playground equipment.

3022
02:24:34,930 --> 02:24:38,610
You can just imagine all the poor kids who get sent flying all over the park.

3023
02:24:39,550 --> 02:24:40,350
That's what I'm thinking.

3024
02:24:41,510 --> 02:24:42,530
Hello, I'm here!

3025
02:24:44,710 --> 02:24:45,070
Wait!

3026
02:24:46,470 --> 02:24:47,190
Oh, I saw it!

3027
02:24:47,190 --> 02:24:48,050
I saw a dead person!

3028
02:24:48,590 --> 02:24:49,630
I saw a dead person!

3029
02:24:50,090 --> 02:24:51,230
Oh, they were on the far left!

3030
02:24:52,850 --> 02:24:53,930
Oh, there you are, Sissel.

3031
02:24:54,810 --> 02:24:59,030
From your dejected expression, I gather, you didn't find what you were looking for.

3032
02:24:59,830 --> 02:25:01,830
Right, I can't find the music box anywhere.

3033
02:25:02,810 --> 02:25:04,390
But I found something else instead.

3034
02:25:04,710 --> 02:25:05,630
Something horrible.

3035
02:25:06,650 --> 02:25:07,130
Horrible?

3036
02:25:07,270 --> 02:25:07,870
What is it?

3037
02:25:07,890 --> 02:25:08,710
A dead body!

3038
02:25:11,770 --> 02:25:12,250
Oh!

3039
02:25:13,510 --> 02:25:14,570
There, in the grass.

3040
02:25:15,170 --> 02:25:16,530
You'd better see for yourself.

3041
02:25:22,100 --> 02:25:23,380
Looks like a dead body!

3042
02:25:26,280 --> 02:25:28,280
I nearly died when I saw it.

3043
02:25:28,500 --> 02:25:32,180
I suppose now that we've found it, we can't just leave it there, can we?

3044
02:25:35,780 --> 02:25:36,880
Nope, I suppose not.

3045
02:25:43,500 --> 02:25:43,940
Mascot...

3046
02:25:45,480 --> 02:25:46,860
Alright, let's make connection!

3047
02:25:50,400 --> 02:25:51,300
Stop reading ahead!

3048
02:25:51,440 --> 02:25:51,920
What do you mean?

3049
02:25:52,900 --> 02:25:53,980
Oh, it's this guy!

3050
02:25:54,140 --> 02:25:54,920
I forgot about him!

3051
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:58,320
Stop the park from being turned into a housing site!

3052
02:25:58,520 --> 02:25:59,740
Protect the park!

3053
02:25:59,900 --> 02:26:00,860
The Rock of the Gods!

3054
02:26:01,860 --> 02:26:02,680
You there!

3055
02:26:03,520 --> 02:26:05,120
You're talking to me, aren't you?

3056
02:26:06,280 --> 02:26:08,060
I have some leaflets for you!

3057
02:26:08,280 --> 02:26:10,680
Leaflets I know you'll be very interested in!

3058
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:14,800
I urge you to peruse it thoroughly!

3059
02:26:15,240 --> 02:26:16,620
Examine it in detail!

3060
02:26:17,960 --> 02:26:19,660
Never mind that right now.

3061
02:26:19,780 --> 02:26:21,100
Do you remember your name?

3062
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:23,280
My name...

3063
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:25,460
My name...

3064
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:31,960
What does my name matter when there are more important things to worry about?

3065
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:34,300
He speaks for the Rocks...

3066
02:26:35,700 --> 02:26:36,260
Okay...

3067
02:26:36,260 --> 02:26:39,280
Come now and study these tracks with me, my brother!

3068
02:26:39,900 --> 02:26:42,880
Come and learn about the Rock of the Gods with me!

3069
02:26:44,080 --> 02:26:45,860
The night is no longer young.

3070
02:26:46,080 --> 02:26:48,140
As a matter of fact, daybreak is approaching.

3071
02:26:48,540 --> 02:26:49,600
But we are young!

3072
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:50,700
It only just turned twelve!

3073
02:26:52,860 --> 02:26:56,040
Look, I don't have time to get involved in your way of life.

3074
02:26:57,220 --> 02:26:59,460
But I am interested about your way of death.

3075
02:27:01,840 --> 02:27:02,880
So let's go back.

3076
02:27:03,020 --> 02:27:04,660
Back to four minutes before your death.

3077
02:27:04,740 --> 02:27:07,460
Oh my god, it's been a while since we've... since we've done a...

3078
02:27:08,180 --> 02:27:11,460
Like this whole stream, we haven't... we haven't gone back in time.

3079
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:20,320
I think he got crushed by the... by the gods.

3080
02:27:24,840 --> 02:27:26,720
Wait, this is a long time ago.

3081
02:27:27,960 --> 02:27:29,580
And so I made up my mind.

3082
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:32,180
I resolved to live here in the park and defend it.

3083
02:27:33,580 --> 02:27:34,020
Okay...

3084
02:27:34,480 --> 02:27:37,080
And what does that have to do with this Rock of the Gods you mentioned?

3085
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:40,580
Yeah, 8.25 p.m.

3086
02:27:42,160 --> 02:27:43,800
You still don't appear to understand.

3087
02:27:45,400 --> 02:27:46,900
No wonder this one is probably hard.

3088
02:27:49,260 --> 02:27:51,840
It's written quite clearly in the fourth leaflet.

3089
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:52,780
In great detail.

3090
02:27:53,820 --> 02:27:55,560
Excuse me, but I have to use the restroom.

3091
02:27:59,620 --> 02:28:05,710
Oh, this is when she gets kidnapped.

3092
02:28:08,390 --> 02:28:09,230
I'm coming!

3093
02:28:11,130 --> 02:28:12,210
Just hold on!

3094
02:28:13,650 --> 02:28:14,770
I'll be right there!

3095
02:28:19,510 --> 02:28:21,550
I'm looking in the door and get me...

3096
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:37,080
Oh, oh, he took it!

3097
02:28:37,560 --> 02:28:38,420
Yes, my dear.

3098
02:28:38,700 --> 02:28:42,100
I'll ever so gently nab her and come right back to your side.

3099
02:28:43,640 --> 02:28:44,560
Dang it, Shaggy.

3100
02:28:45,240 --> 02:28:46,200
It's all your fault.

3101
02:28:46,920 --> 02:28:48,780
Oh, he's gonna, like, hit the lever, isn't he?

3102
02:28:49,640 --> 02:28:50,940
Good evening, young lady.

3103
02:28:51,080 --> 02:28:52,180
Won't you come with me?

3104
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:53,600
Ew!

3105
02:28:53,740 --> 02:28:54,560
Oh, my God, sorry.

3106
02:28:54,940 --> 02:28:55,340
Oh!

3107
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:57,120
Shaggy!

3108
02:28:59,100 --> 02:28:59,800
Oh, my God.

3109
02:28:59,820 --> 02:29:00,180
Oh, my God.

3110
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:00,940
Wait, that guy...

3111
02:29:00,940 --> 02:29:03,360
Wait, the hippie is actually wearing Shaggy's clothes.

3112
02:29:04,780 --> 02:29:06,300
Oh, guys, what do I do?

3113
02:29:06,380 --> 02:29:07,120
What should I do?

3114
02:29:07,220 --> 02:29:08,000
I have to do something.

3115
02:29:24,480 --> 02:29:26,200
Is this where she died?

3116
02:29:31,660 --> 02:29:32,760
Oh, my God, wait.

3117
02:29:33,300 --> 02:29:34,740
We have to ghost trick?

3118
02:29:36,480 --> 02:29:39,920
We have to ghost trick to stop someone else's ghost trick?

3119
02:29:42,480 --> 02:29:43,320
No way!

3120
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:45,960
What in the world just happened?

3121
02:29:47,240 --> 02:29:48,580
Oh, that's Mino.

3122
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:50,160
Mino?

3123
02:29:51,500 --> 02:29:53,640
Mino, the mascot, the symbol of Temsik Park.

3124
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:57,440
Forget about the name of that big creepy lump of concrete.

3125
02:29:58,420 --> 02:30:00,080
Talking about the way it changed direction.

3126
02:30:00,180 --> 02:30:00,900
Did you see that?

3127
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:04,180
Yes, yes, I did.

3128
02:30:04,320 --> 02:30:05,820
And we witnessed it with our own eyes.

3129
02:30:05,880 --> 02:30:07,240
The power of the Rock of the Gods.

3130
02:30:08,420 --> 02:30:09,820
That was the power of the Gods.

3131
02:30:10,020 --> 02:30:11,960
The power of the Gods saved that little girl.

3132
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:15,940
And then that same power very deliberately crushed her.

3133
02:30:15,940 --> 02:30:16,460
And it crushed you instead?

3134
02:30:17,800 --> 02:30:19,740
You gotta ghost the ghost trick.

3135
02:30:20,660 --> 02:30:21,820
Yes, yes, precisely.

3136
02:30:22,260 --> 02:30:24,360
That is called the mischief of the Gods.

3137
02:30:25,460 --> 02:30:27,300
This is how Shaggy's parents met.

3138
02:30:29,360 --> 02:30:29,880
What?

3139
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:32,360
What?

3140
02:30:46,840 --> 02:30:48,460
That couldn't have been a ghost trick.

3141
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:52,180
No ghost trick could change the direction of something that heavy in mid-air.

3142
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:56,220
But wait a minute.

3143
02:30:56,840 --> 02:30:59,580
What if there was somebody with much greater powers than me?

3144
02:31:17,540 --> 02:31:19,560
There's another flame besides mine.

3145
02:31:21,980 --> 02:31:24,440
Oh, is that the flame of a god, is it?

3146
02:31:25,560 --> 02:31:26,300
But hold on.

3147
02:31:28,120 --> 02:31:30,060
Your spirit is a flame too, isn't it?

3148
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:31,480
Yeah, so?

3149
02:31:32,340 --> 02:31:34,300
Pardon me, but are you a god?

3150
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:35,560
I knew he was gonna ask that.

3151
02:31:36,200 --> 02:31:37,440
Because I read the script.

3152
02:31:38,020 --> 02:31:39,360
I sincerely doubt it.

3153
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:41,640
Brother!

3154
02:31:42,580 --> 02:31:46,120
At the last minute, that big lump of concrete made a huge swing to one side.

3155
02:31:46,740 --> 02:31:48,360
That was probably that flame's doing.

3156
02:31:49,180 --> 02:31:50,080
Who could it be?

3157
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:52,000
It's not a missile, is it?

3158
02:31:52,340 --> 02:31:55,780
I definitely believe it's either a god or somebody god related.

3159
02:31:56,940 --> 02:31:58,940
Maybe I'd better try talking to this person.

3160
02:32:02,240 --> 02:32:03,020
Here we go.

3161
02:32:05,960 --> 02:32:06,440
What the?

3162
02:32:06,440 --> 02:32:09,080
This person with much greater powers than me.

3163
02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:09,960
It's...

3164
02:32:10,400 --> 02:32:10,840
Missile?

3165
02:32:11,700 --> 02:32:12,140
You?

3166
02:32:13,580 --> 02:32:14,020
Hey!

3167
02:32:19,770 --> 02:32:20,210
Sizzle!

3168
02:32:21,890 --> 02:32:22,770
It's Missile!

3169
02:32:25,190 --> 02:32:26,730
Wait, does that mean Missile's dead?

3170
02:32:27,730 --> 02:32:28,370
Uh-oh.

3171
02:32:29,170 --> 02:32:30,610
Wait, does that mean Missile's dead?

3172
02:32:31,690 --> 02:32:32,850
Oh my, it's...

3173
02:32:33,730 --> 02:32:34,170
Missile!

3174
02:32:35,410 --> 02:32:37,070
You look well for being dead.

3175
02:32:37,770 --> 02:32:38,570
Did you see?

3176
02:32:38,670 --> 02:32:39,830
Did you see what I did?

3177
02:32:39,830 --> 02:32:40,110
I did it!

3178
02:32:40,950 --> 02:32:42,850
I tried really hard and I did it!

3179
02:32:43,050 --> 02:32:44,530
I saved Miss Camilla!

3180
02:32:45,430 --> 02:32:46,290
What is that?

3181
02:32:47,170 --> 02:32:49,350
Are you telling me I was done in by a puppy dog?

3182
02:32:50,350 --> 02:32:51,670
Sizzle, what's going on?

3183
02:32:51,770 --> 02:32:53,230
How did you get the powers of the dead?

3184
02:32:54,810 --> 02:32:56,270
I'm glad you asked!

3185
02:32:58,470 --> 02:33:00,370
After Miss Camilla went out and you left?

3186
02:33:01,570 --> 02:33:03,050
Run, run, run, Missile!

3187
02:33:04,250 --> 02:33:05,990
Yeah, Missile's back, Missile!

3188
02:33:08,070 --> 02:33:08,950
Missile, Missile!

3189
02:33:08,950 --> 02:33:11,850
I worked like crazy to make my own path and I did it!

3190
02:33:15,590 --> 02:33:15,990
Missile!

3191
02:33:17,450 --> 02:33:18,250
Smart dog.

3192
02:33:19,410 --> 02:33:20,130
Smart dog.

3193
02:33:20,590 --> 02:33:23,510
And then I followed Miss Camilla out into the big wide world!

3194
02:33:30,650 --> 02:33:31,950
Oh my god, this is where it happened.

3195
02:33:32,910 --> 02:33:35,710
And then, here at this park, I found her at last!

3196
02:33:36,290 --> 02:33:37,850
Yes, you guessed it, I barked!

3197
02:33:37,870 --> 02:33:38,570
You bet I did!

3198
02:33:38,670 --> 02:33:40,030
And I went running after her too!

3199
02:33:41,990 --> 02:33:42,710
Woof, woof!

3200
02:33:56,200 --> 02:33:58,400
And then I guess I died.

3201
02:34:00,120 --> 02:34:00,920
Missile...

3202
02:34:04,820 --> 02:34:05,620
Missile!

3203
02:34:07,140 --> 02:34:07,940
Missile!

3204
02:34:08,980 --> 02:34:10,360
Missile, Missile!

3205
02:34:11,240 --> 02:34:12,040
Missile!

3206
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:16,140
And then, I was unconscious for a little while.

3207
02:34:17,400 --> 02:34:19,100
Shaggy killed Missile.

3208
02:34:19,440 --> 02:34:20,140
Missile...

3209
02:34:22,100 --> 02:34:22,900
Missile...

3210
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:26,240
Missile!

3211
02:34:51,360 --> 02:34:51,840
Missile!

3212
02:34:52,120 --> 02:34:52,260
Missile!

3213
02:34:52,260 --> 02:34:52,320
Missile!

3214
02:34:52,320 --> 02:34:52,560
Missile!

3215
02:34:53,060 --> 02:34:53,540
Missile!

3216
02:34:53,540 --> 02:34:53,820
Missile!

3217
02:34:54,280 --> 02:34:54,500
Missile!

3218
02:34:55,400 --> 02:34:55,580
Missile!

3219
02:34:56,720 --> 02:34:57,200
Missile!

3220
02:34:57,360 --> 02:34:57,380
Missile!

3221
02:34:57,400 --> 02:34:57,500
Missile!

3222
02:34:57,860 --> 02:34:57,920
Missile!

3223
02:34:57,940 --> 02:34:57,960
Missile!

3224
02:34:57,960 --> 02:34:58,220
Missile!

3225
02:35:00,660 --> 02:35:04,940
I can't tell you how surprised I was, but I bet you understand, right?

3226
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:08,120
Better than probably anybody else could.

3227
02:35:09,020 --> 02:35:11,640
And then I remembered what you did for me, how you saved me.

3228
02:35:13,240 --> 02:35:14,760
So, you went back, right?

3229
02:35:14,820 --> 02:35:16,040
Back to four minutes before...

3230
02:35:16,040 --> 02:35:19,640
Wait, that means Camilla and Missile are able to communicate with each other.

3231
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:24,320
Shaggy, you will never be forgiven.

3232
02:35:25,520 --> 02:35:28,820
I hope... I hope... I hope you never...

3233
02:35:28,820 --> 02:35:31,800
I hope the blue lady never smiles at you ever again.

3234
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,120
You went back, right?

3235
02:35:34,220 --> 02:35:36,620
Back to four minutes before the little lady's death.

3236
02:35:37,240 --> 02:35:38,680
You bet I did!

3237
02:35:41,180 --> 02:35:42,860
Yeah, and that's why Camilla has a core!

3238
02:35:47,260 --> 02:35:52,400
Yes, my dear Oliver, so gently nab her...

3239
02:35:53,100 --> 02:35:54,160
We've heard this before.

3240
02:35:54,780 --> 02:35:55,700
And he says...

3241
02:35:55,880 --> 02:35:56,220
Come with me.

3242
02:35:58,940 --> 02:35:59,340
Awful.

3243
02:35:59,460 --> 02:36:00,180
I hate you, Shaggy.

3244
02:36:00,340 --> 02:36:01,300
I hate you, Shaggy.

3245
02:36:01,560 --> 02:36:02,900
I hate you, Shaggy.

3246
02:36:09,360 --> 02:36:10,420
Now's my chance!

3247
02:36:10,900 --> 02:36:12,360
I thought I saw the core!

3248
02:36:12,800 --> 02:36:14,080
Oh, now's my chance, I thought.

3249
02:36:14,120 --> 02:36:14,780
I saw the core!

3250
02:36:15,380 --> 02:36:16,700
I don't know, it looks pretty far.

3251
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:19,480
I stretched out my paw towards the core!

3252
02:36:20,220 --> 02:36:21,840
Oh wow, I felt out that moment.

3253
02:36:22,500 --> 02:36:24,560
I'd love for you to be able to feel it too.

3254
02:36:25,160 --> 02:36:26,040
Go ahead, Sissel.

3255
02:36:26,140 --> 02:36:27,500
Go ahead and try it for yourself.

3256
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:29,860
Whoa!

3257
02:36:31,420 --> 02:36:32,720
I can't believe it.

3258
02:36:33,500 --> 02:36:36,940
How could you connect over such a great distance?

3259
02:36:38,060 --> 02:36:40,240
Well, they don't call me Missile for nothing.

3260
02:36:42,740 --> 02:36:46,640
And so, then you manipulated that Mino thing and threw it aside.

3261
02:36:47,480 --> 02:36:49,020
Right on top of my head.

3262
02:36:49,940 --> 02:36:51,940
Well, no actually.

3263
02:36:52,580 --> 02:36:53,160
Hm?

3264
02:36:54,460 --> 02:36:56,820
I can't manipulate things like you can, Sissel.

3265
02:36:56,820 --> 02:36:58,160
You can't?

3266
02:36:58,320 --> 02:36:59,440
And how did you...

3267
02:36:59,940 --> 02:37:02,120
I don't know what to... I didn't know what to do!

3268
02:37:02,320 --> 02:37:05,020
Then I happened to see something out of the corner of my eye.

3269
02:37:06,040 --> 02:37:07,380
And it had a core too!

3270
02:37:10,280 --> 02:37:12,540
A single leaf hanging from the tree!

3271
02:37:12,620 --> 02:37:13,000
Wait...

3272
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:16,300
So, is Missile's ghost powers like...

3273
02:37:18,160 --> 02:37:20,820
Able to connect a thing?

3274
02:37:20,940 --> 02:37:22,300
So it kind of like swung?

3275
02:37:22,540 --> 02:37:25,160
Like his power is this...

3276
02:37:25,160 --> 02:37:26,120
He like...

3277
02:37:27,300 --> 02:37:27,800
Swapping?

3278
02:37:27,960 --> 02:37:28,820
Oh, maybe swapping.

3279
02:37:29,480 --> 02:37:30,260
Oh, I don't know.

3280
02:37:30,340 --> 02:37:30,540
Let's see.

3281
02:37:30,840 --> 02:37:32,900
I thought he like had it swing over there.

3282
02:37:34,080 --> 02:37:35,840
I tried reaching out to the leaf!

3283
02:37:39,630 --> 02:37:40,650
What in the world?

3284
02:37:41,450 --> 02:37:42,870
I can't manipulate things.

3285
02:37:43,170 --> 02:37:43,930
But apparently...

3286
02:37:43,930 --> 02:37:45,270
Oh, he swapped them!

3287
02:37:46,330 --> 02:37:48,770
As long as the two things have the same shape that...

3288
02:37:49,330 --> 02:37:49,830
Oh...

3289
02:37:49,830 --> 02:37:51,370
That is so...

3290
02:37:52,130 --> 02:37:52,630
Specific.

3291
02:37:54,050 --> 02:37:55,760
Swap things with the same shape...

3292
02:37:56,760 --> 02:37:58,020
Go ahead and try it!

3293
02:37:58,100 --> 02:37:58,760
First swap!

3294
02:38:02,380 --> 02:38:03,260
So now...

3295
02:38:04,120 --> 02:38:04,780
That's incredible!

3296
02:38:05,720 --> 02:38:06,540
Oh my gosh.

3297
02:38:06,640 --> 02:38:09,300
This late into the game they're introducing a new game mechanic?

3298
02:38:09,500 --> 02:38:10,740
No wonder this puzzle is so difficult.

3299
02:38:11,840 --> 02:38:13,780
So that's how you saved your mistress, is it?

3300
02:38:14,480 --> 02:38:16,800
And that's how I became caught up in this, is it?

3301
02:38:17,900 --> 02:38:18,800
I'm very sorry!

3302
02:38:19,840 --> 02:38:21,560
My powers were too meager!

3303
02:38:22,860 --> 02:38:23,300
Meager...

3304
02:38:23,800 --> 02:38:24,580
Because you see...

3305
02:38:24,580 --> 02:38:26,020
I saw one more...

3306
02:38:29,300 --> 02:38:31,700
I happened to notice one more core!

3307
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:33,500
There was something...

3308
02:38:33,500 --> 02:38:36,520
With the exact same shape stuck in the branches of a tree!

3309
02:38:37,520 --> 02:38:38,140
You're right!

3310
02:38:38,320 --> 02:38:39,360
It's the rugby ball.

3311
02:38:39,620 --> 02:38:42,240
If Mino could be swapped again with that...

3312
02:38:42,240 --> 02:38:44,460
Then disaster wouldn't have to...

3313
02:38:44,460 --> 02:38:46,340
Have to rain down on my head.

3314
02:38:48,860 --> 02:38:49,960
But what is that thing?

3315
02:38:50,180 --> 02:38:51,560
It's too big to be a leaf.

3316
02:38:51,560 --> 02:38:55,460
Whatever it is, I'd much prefer it on my head than Mino.

3317
02:38:57,440 --> 02:38:59,000
So why didn't you swap them, Missile?

3318
02:38:59,100 --> 02:38:59,720
It's too far.

3319
02:39:00,320 --> 02:39:00,720
Couldn't.

3320
02:39:01,020 --> 02:39:04,120
I could stretch out my paw a little further than you can, Missile.

3321
02:39:07,220 --> 02:39:09,260
But this was just too far for me.

3322
02:39:09,320 --> 02:39:09,920
I couldn't reach.

3323
02:39:14,060 --> 02:39:14,580
Ta-da!

3324
02:39:19,530 --> 02:39:20,910
Now it's not a beehive.

3325
02:39:21,070 --> 02:39:22,130
It's a rugby ball.

3326
02:39:22,790 --> 02:39:23,190
Sorry.

3327
02:39:24,310 --> 02:39:27,030
I must admit, it's a fascinating spectacle of a death.

3328
02:39:27,210 --> 02:39:28,410
If I do say so myself.

3329
02:39:32,090 --> 02:39:32,890
I couldn't reach it.

3330
02:39:34,870 --> 02:39:35,430
Oh well.

3331
02:39:36,290 --> 02:39:39,610
I kept retrying over and over, seeing if there was anything I could do.

3332
02:39:40,610 --> 02:39:42,210
I bet there's something you can do now.

3333
02:39:43,750 --> 02:39:45,570
If we work together, you and me.

3334
02:39:46,430 --> 02:39:47,330
Cecil, you think so?

3335
02:39:49,430 --> 02:39:50,330
Wait, but then...

3336
02:39:50,330 --> 02:39:51,010
But then...

3337
02:39:51,010 --> 02:39:51,550
Can we...

3338
02:39:51,550 --> 02:39:53,610
Can we save Missile?

3339
02:39:54,610 --> 02:39:57,150
I don't plan on letting anybody die in front of me tonight.

3340
02:39:58,170 --> 02:39:59,550
Do you think you could help me?

3341
02:40:00,270 --> 02:40:01,070
Of course!

3342
02:40:02,730 --> 02:40:03,130
Naturally!

3343
02:40:04,010 --> 02:40:06,850
So we're going to drop that Mino thing in a different spot.

3344
02:40:07,810 --> 02:40:08,790
Okay, let's try it.

3345
02:40:08,850 --> 02:40:10,410
Let's go back again to four minutes before.

3346
02:40:11,590 --> 02:40:13,750
Wait, we have to save Missile.

3347
02:40:20,480 --> 02:40:22,700
I swear, if she goes back...

3348
02:40:23,340 --> 02:40:26,500
If we go back to the present and she's alive and everything and...

3349
02:40:26,980 --> 02:40:28,020
Oh wait, though.

3350
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:34,080
No, because she'll have already been kidnapped.

3351
02:40:34,580 --> 02:40:37,500
But if Missile's just there lying in that...

3352
02:40:38,020 --> 02:40:39,200
In that poor...

3353
02:40:39,200 --> 02:40:41,160
In that poor ditch...

3354
02:40:41,160 --> 02:40:42,300
I'll be so sad.

3355
02:40:43,060 --> 02:40:44,040
Let's get started.

3356
02:40:45,220 --> 02:40:48,020
Four minutes from now, you'll swap Mino with the leaf.

3357
02:40:48,320 --> 02:40:50,480
And then you'll have to swap Mino with something else.

3358
02:40:52,120 --> 02:40:53,540
Something with the same shape.

3359
02:40:54,400 --> 02:40:56,080
Oh, I believe that's a rugby ball.

3360
02:40:56,860 --> 02:40:58,100
Okay, rugby ball, huh?

3361
02:40:58,100 --> 02:41:01,440
But with the rugby ball where it is now, Missile can't reach it.

3362
02:41:01,680 --> 02:41:03,640
So that means we have to move it closer somehow.

3363
02:41:04,260 --> 02:41:06,360
Looks like you and I will have to work together on this...

3364
02:41:06,360 --> 02:41:07,160
On that one, Missile.

3365
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:09,060
Okay, I'm ready.

3366
02:41:10,200 --> 02:41:12,140
Whenever you want to use my swap trick...

3367
02:41:12,140 --> 02:41:14,080
Just press Z, R.

3368
02:41:14,380 --> 02:41:14,660
Okay.

3369
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:16,080
Z, R.

3370
02:41:17,920 --> 02:41:19,700
That way you'll be able to control me.

3371
02:41:20,400 --> 02:41:22,100
And then if you press Z, R...

3372
02:41:23,780 --> 02:41:25,140
Control will come back to me.

3373
02:41:25,320 --> 02:41:25,680
Okay.

3374
02:41:26,300 --> 02:41:27,140
Let's try it.

3375
02:41:27,140 --> 02:41:29,440
Together we can stop Mino from hurting anybody.

3376
02:41:31,240 --> 02:41:31,900
Trick time.

3377
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:35,680
Alright, Missile.

3378
02:41:35,780 --> 02:41:37,280
Your powers are the key this time.

3379
02:41:37,920 --> 02:41:38,760
Okay, I'm ready.

3380
02:41:39,040 --> 02:41:41,040
I can swap anything that has the same shape.

3381
02:41:41,400 --> 02:41:42,820
Just call on me if you want to...

3382
02:41:42,820 --> 02:41:44,040
If you find anything you want to try.

3383
02:41:44,540 --> 02:41:47,720
The best thing to do is to try and find a bunch of things and see how it goes.

3384
02:41:49,120 --> 02:41:49,960
Use Z, R.

3385
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:51,060
Alright, let's head back.

3386
02:41:54,020 --> 02:41:54,420
Open.

3387
02:42:08,120 --> 02:42:08,780
Oh, wait.

3388
02:42:08,920 --> 02:42:09,580
Oh, there we go.

3389
02:42:11,800 --> 02:42:12,900
Oh, here he comes.

3390
02:42:12,940 --> 02:42:13,240
Here he comes.

3391
02:42:13,400 --> 02:42:13,860
Uh-oh.

3392
02:42:14,680 --> 02:42:15,620
Time is passing.

3393
02:42:16,060 --> 02:42:16,760
Oh, no.

3394
02:42:16,840 --> 02:42:17,160
Wait.

3395
02:42:18,540 --> 02:42:18,940
Um...

3396
02:42:19,420 --> 02:42:19,620
Wait.

3397
02:42:19,680 --> 02:42:20,720
So can I swap the...

3398
02:42:20,720 --> 02:42:21,580
Let's see.

3399
02:42:21,660 --> 02:42:22,140
Z, R.

3400
02:42:24,920 --> 02:42:26,640
Oh, and he can move further too.

3401
02:42:28,880 --> 02:42:29,700
That's so crazy.

3402
02:42:31,680 --> 02:42:32,080
Okay.

3403
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:32,680
Okay.

3404
02:42:33,440 --> 02:42:36,860
Maybe swap the basketball and that.

3405
02:42:37,560 --> 02:42:38,160
Oh, wait.

3406
02:42:38,200 --> 02:42:39,120
But I'm in the bass...

3407
02:42:39,120 --> 02:42:39,940
I'm in the baseball.

3408
02:42:40,200 --> 02:42:40,920
They're the same shape.

3409
02:42:42,060 --> 02:42:42,500
Um...

3410
02:42:43,080 --> 02:42:44,780
I think we need to...

3411
02:42:45,720 --> 02:42:46,160
Uh...

3412
02:42:46,780 --> 02:42:47,220
Wait.

3413
02:42:47,260 --> 02:42:47,980
How do I swap them?

3414
02:42:55,490 --> 02:42:56,070
Oh, wait.

3415
02:42:56,170 --> 02:42:56,490
Uh...

3416
02:42:56,490 --> 02:42:57,310
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

3417
02:43:00,050 --> 02:43:00,490
Swap.

3418
02:43:02,190 --> 02:43:03,350
But does that do anything?

3419
02:43:04,450 --> 02:43:05,690
Because I'm still here.

3420
02:43:06,410 --> 02:43:07,750
That didn't really help me.

3421
02:43:08,890 --> 02:43:09,330
Hold

3422
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:18,220
on.

3423
02:43:18,620 --> 02:43:19,760
Oh, now it's too heavy.

3424
02:43:20,720 --> 02:43:22,180
Maybe because of the swap I made.

3425
02:43:22,760 --> 02:43:25,020
I guess the little ball is about all the weight I can handle.

3426
02:43:25,300 --> 02:43:25,740
Okay.

3427
02:43:26,700 --> 02:43:27,720
Let's go ghost.

3428
02:43:28,320 --> 02:43:29,200
Z, R.

3429
02:43:29,660 --> 02:43:30,500
Swap them back.

3430
02:43:31,060 --> 02:43:32,260
Let's swap the...

3431
02:43:37,310 --> 02:43:38,790
Let's swap the...

3432
02:43:38,790 --> 02:43:39,350
Um...

3433
02:43:39,810 --> 02:43:40,250
Tire?

3434
02:43:41,490 --> 02:43:42,150
Oh, my God.

3435
02:43:43,690 --> 02:43:44,270
Oh, wait.

3436
02:43:44,630 --> 02:43:45,070
Uh...

3437
02:43:45,070 --> 02:43:45,970
We'll stay here.

3438
02:43:46,190 --> 02:43:46,910
Z, R.

3439
02:43:46,950 --> 02:43:47,130
Z, R.

3440
02:43:49,750 --> 02:43:50,070
Swap.

3441
02:43:50,070 --> 02:43:50,230
Oh, wait.

3442
02:43:50,290 --> 02:43:50,490
No.

3443
02:43:51,110 --> 02:43:51,630
Oh, wait.

3444
02:43:53,170 --> 02:43:53,490
Hmm...

3445
02:43:54,730 --> 02:43:55,050
Okay.

3446
02:43:55,070 --> 02:43:55,890
Let's just see what else there...

3447
02:43:55,890 --> 02:43:56,290
Oh, my God.

3448
02:43:56,330 --> 02:43:56,910
He's just there.

3449
02:43:58,390 --> 02:43:59,570
There's also the love letter.

3450
02:44:05,790 --> 02:44:07,310
Look at this funny flattened ball.

3451
02:44:12,100 --> 02:44:14,020
It's the same shape as that horrible Mino.

3452
02:44:14,480 --> 02:44:15,780
That's too far to swap from here.

3453
02:44:16,340 --> 02:44:18,280
Even this ball is starting to look horrible to me.

3454
02:44:19,080 --> 02:44:20,520
We have to find a way to get it closer.

3455
02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:22,380
Lock it down from the tree, I say.

3456
02:44:22,700 --> 02:44:23,020
Oh, my God.

3457
02:44:23,020 --> 02:44:23,140
Oh, my God.

3458
02:44:23,140 --> 02:44:24,140
There must be something we can do.

3459
02:44:26,720 --> 02:44:27,860
Time is passing.

3460
02:44:28,680 --> 02:44:32,400
And then he flies all his things around.

3461
02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:33,780
Oh, man.

3462
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:36,160
This is so tricky.

3463
02:44:37,760 --> 02:44:38,260
Hmm...

3464
02:44:40,520 --> 02:44:41,900
You're in the seesaw, aren't you?

3465
02:44:43,120 --> 02:44:43,620
Uh...

3466
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:45,260
Yes.

3467
02:45:05,100 --> 02:45:05,600
Okay.

3468
02:45:05,660 --> 02:45:06,520
I can reach this.

3469
02:45:06,820 --> 02:45:07,980
So, what if I do this?

3470
02:45:08,740 --> 02:45:09,240
Swap.

3471
02:45:09,720 --> 02:45:10,600
And then...

3472
02:45:10,600 --> 02:45:10,780
Z, R.

3473
02:45:11,640 --> 02:45:12,080
Swap.

3474
02:45:13,440 --> 02:45:14,320
And then...

3475
02:45:16,260 --> 02:45:16,700
Swap.

3476
02:45:17,420 --> 02:45:17,860
Okay.

3477
02:45:18,040 --> 02:45:19,100
That should be it.

3478
02:45:19,240 --> 02:45:19,680
That should be it.

3479
02:45:21,140 --> 02:45:22,020
Then we...

3480
02:45:22,020 --> 02:45:22,380
Uh...

3481
02:45:22,380 --> 02:45:22,560
Oh.

3482
02:45:22,800 --> 02:45:24,360
We need the seesaw to move back.

3483
02:45:25,580 --> 02:45:26,260
Oh, my gosh.

3484
02:45:26,280 --> 02:45:26,540
Please.

3485
02:45:26,600 --> 02:45:26,960
Move.

3486
02:45:27,120 --> 02:45:27,740
There we go.

3487
02:45:28,120 --> 02:45:29,200
And we go...

3488
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:29,780
Oh, there we go.

3489
02:45:30,700 --> 02:45:31,140
No!

3490
02:45:31,300 --> 02:45:31,600
Ah!

3491
02:45:32,060 --> 02:45:32,500
Oh!

3492
02:45:32,620 --> 02:45:33,060
Oh!

3493
02:45:33,220 --> 02:45:33,580
Oh!

3494
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:34,360
Okay.

3495
02:45:34,920 --> 02:45:35,360
Uh...

3496
02:45:37,160 --> 02:45:37,600
Maybe...

3497
02:45:37,600 --> 02:45:39,820
Oh, maybe we have it so he doesn't...

3498
02:45:40,340 --> 02:45:40,780
Oh!

3499
02:45:41,820 --> 02:45:43,500
What do you think of my lightning fast pace?

3500
02:45:46,820 --> 02:45:48,200
I wish he wouldn't knock it off.

3501
02:45:48,260 --> 02:45:49,260
I wish he would knock it off.

3502
02:45:49,320 --> 02:45:49,940
That's what I think.

3503
02:45:50,020 --> 02:45:51,320
We don't have time to prepare.

3504
02:45:52,020 --> 02:45:54,260
I think we're gonna have to find a way to stop him from running.

3505
02:45:55,940 --> 02:45:56,260
So...

3506
02:45:56,880 --> 02:45:57,200
Uh...

3507
02:45:58,280 --> 02:46:00,180
Maybe we stop him from using the thing.

3508
02:46:00,300 --> 02:46:00,840
The seesaw.

3509
02:46:00,920 --> 02:46:01,260
The swing.

3510
02:46:01,360 --> 02:46:01,840
Those things.

3511
02:46:02,840 --> 02:46:03,160
Precisely.

3512
02:46:03,300 --> 02:46:05,100
Except there are one more piece of equipment I...

3513
02:46:05,100 --> 02:46:05,860
To be exact.

3514
02:46:06,660 --> 02:46:07,920
Stop him with the equipment, eh?

3515
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:09,660
Maybe I should rethink things here.

3516
02:46:09,660 --> 02:46:10,840
Well, hold on.

3517
02:46:10,960 --> 02:46:11,980
I'm still trying to...

3518
02:46:13,080 --> 02:46:14,460
Get over here.

3519
02:46:18,490 --> 02:46:19,010
Talk?

3520
02:46:19,330 --> 02:46:20,190
Why am I talking?

3521
02:46:21,310 --> 02:46:21,970
Oh, no!

3522
02:46:22,110 --> 02:46:22,370
Wait!

3523
02:46:22,490 --> 02:46:23,090
Oh, I forgot.

3524
02:46:23,170 --> 02:46:24,010
Missile was in the baseball.

3525
02:46:24,870 --> 02:46:25,910
This is so confusing.

3526
02:46:26,770 --> 02:46:28,970
That funny flattened ball is still in the tree.

3527
02:46:29,410 --> 02:46:30,110
I know.

3528
02:46:30,510 --> 02:46:31,890
There isn't much more time.

3529
02:46:33,810 --> 02:46:35,510
I wonder if maybe the...

3530
02:46:35,510 --> 02:46:36,590
Well, I don't think...

3531
02:46:37,270 --> 02:46:38,210
Knocking the...

3532
02:46:38,210 --> 02:46:41,010
I don't think knocking the rugby ball...

3533
02:46:42,050 --> 02:46:43,930
With, like, a basketball...

3534
02:46:43,930 --> 02:46:45,450
I don't think getting it on the ground is helpful.

3535
02:46:47,130 --> 02:46:49,810
I have to find a way somehow.

3536
02:46:51,090 --> 02:46:51,670
Okay.

3537
02:46:51,890 --> 02:46:52,770
You move there.

3538
02:46:53,550 --> 02:46:54,670
You move there.

3539
02:46:59,330 --> 02:47:00,890
Oh, I'm still too short.

3540
02:47:03,630 --> 02:47:04,210
Okay.

3541
02:47:12,050 --> 02:47:13,090
And the swing.

3542
02:47:13,270 --> 02:47:14,130
We can't make it.

3543
02:47:15,310 --> 02:47:15,890
Oh!

3544
02:47:16,030 --> 02:47:17,210
This one's really hard!

3545
02:47:17,890 --> 02:47:18,470
Okay.

3546
02:47:19,130 --> 02:47:19,710
Ha!

3547
02:47:19,910 --> 02:47:19,990
Oh!

3548
02:47:19,990 --> 02:47:20,550
Um...

3549
02:47:24,090 --> 02:47:26,310
I feel like we need the tire...

3550
02:47:26,310 --> 02:47:26,550
Oh!

3551
02:47:26,630 --> 02:47:37,190
The tire needs to go either in here to make it too heavy for him to spin around or on here to make it so he can't...

3552
02:47:38,110 --> 02:47:39,510
He can't lift up.

3553
02:47:41,750 --> 02:47:42,190
Hmm...

3554
02:47:43,190 --> 02:47:48,690
But it's also timing because we need him to be on the swing so that we can...

3555
02:47:48,690 --> 02:47:49,970
Well, do we need to connect the...

3556
02:47:49,970 --> 02:47:50,350
Connect to the swing?

3557
02:47:50,490 --> 02:47:51,290
Maybe we don't.

3558
02:47:52,630 --> 02:47:53,110
Oh!

3559
02:47:53,290 --> 02:47:53,950
This one's tricky.

3560
02:47:54,930 --> 02:47:55,410
Oh!

3561
02:47:56,710 --> 02:47:58,710
The balls are very important for the puzzle.

3562
02:47:58,870 --> 02:47:59,610
Yeah, I can tell.

3563
02:48:01,110 --> 02:48:02,450
I've gathered that much.

3564
02:48:35,430 --> 02:48:35,910
Because...

3565
02:48:36,590 --> 02:48:39,510
Do I stop him from getting over here, like they said?

3566
02:48:39,710 --> 02:48:42,610
Or do I get the rugby ball out of the tree?

3567
02:48:47,030 --> 02:48:48,190
Is the question.

3568
02:48:55,440 --> 02:48:55,920
Hmm...

3569
02:48:56,300 --> 02:48:57,680
I think you missed your chance at this point.

3570
02:48:57,780 --> 02:48:58,200
I agree.

3571
02:48:59,320 --> 02:49:00,040
I agree.

3572
02:49:00,300 --> 02:49:01,120
No, I think...

3573
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:01,820
I think so too.

3574
02:49:03,840 --> 02:49:04,280
But...

3575
02:49:05,280 --> 02:49:08,140
I think I'm still trying to cook a little bit.

3576
02:49:09,040 --> 02:49:09,920
I'm trying to...

3577
02:49:09,920 --> 02:49:11,660
I'm trying to think...

3578
02:49:11,660 --> 02:49:14,080
It's probably easier to just do though, you know?

3579
02:49:16,640 --> 02:49:18,400
Because I can't even get over here.

3580
02:49:19,260 --> 02:49:19,700
Yeah!

3581
02:49:24,890 --> 02:49:26,670
So I think it has to be...

3582
02:49:28,170 --> 02:49:28,610
Oh!

3583
02:49:29,210 --> 02:49:29,730
Unless...

3584
02:49:29,730 --> 02:49:29,890
Okay.

3585
02:49:30,550 --> 02:49:31,930
I'm possessing a ball.

3586
02:49:32,990 --> 02:49:33,510
Well...

3587
02:49:33,510 --> 02:49:33,770
Hmm...

3588
02:49:38,230 --> 02:49:40,550
I have to be able to possess a ball...

3589
02:49:40,550 --> 02:49:41,590
I think.

3590
02:49:41,670 --> 02:49:42,970
To be able to...

3591
02:49:43,810 --> 02:49:45,990
When it gets launched in the air...

3592
02:49:46,930 --> 02:49:47,450
Right?

3593
02:49:48,450 --> 02:49:50,370
I think I have to possess...

3594
02:49:51,250 --> 02:49:51,770
Something.

3595
02:49:51,990 --> 02:49:53,170
Maybe the basketball.

3596
02:49:53,810 --> 02:49:54,330
Okay.

3597
02:49:54,330 --> 02:49:55,130
I'm just gonna restart.

3598
02:49:56,550 --> 02:49:57,590
I'm just gonna restart.

3599
02:50:00,190 --> 02:50:01,210
And we'll try something.

3600
02:50:01,210 --> 02:50:02,630
I'm gonna be swapping the balls a little bit.

3601
02:50:04,770 --> 02:50:06,050
Oh man!

3602
02:50:06,550 --> 02:50:06,910
Okay.

3603
02:50:07,370 --> 02:50:08,210
Here we go!

3604
02:50:13,080 --> 02:50:13,400
Open!

3605
02:50:14,080 --> 02:50:14,400
Sesame!

3606
02:50:19,100 --> 02:50:19,820
If I...

3607
02:50:20,340 --> 02:50:21,860
May backseat for a moment...

3608
02:50:21,860 --> 02:50:23,680
I would advise simply solving the puzzle.

3609
02:50:23,940 --> 02:50:24,340
Oh!

3610
02:50:25,320 --> 02:50:26,280
Thank you!

3611
02:50:26,460 --> 02:50:27,560
You're so right!

3612
02:50:27,860 --> 02:50:29,400
You are so right!

3613
02:50:30,100 --> 02:50:31,760
Where does the tire go?

3614
02:50:33,340 --> 02:50:33,480
Oh!

3615
02:50:34,220 --> 02:50:35,540
Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom...

3616
02:50:36,200 --> 02:50:37,800
And we have to stop him from running...

3617
02:50:37,800 --> 02:50:39,040
But I think he'll still try to spin.

3618
02:50:39,440 --> 02:50:39,840
So...

3619
02:50:40,500 --> 02:50:40,900
Let's...

3620
02:50:40,900 --> 02:50:42,800
Put the tire...

3621
02:50:44,820 --> 02:50:45,360
Oh no!

3622
02:50:46,980 --> 02:50:47,380
Let's...

3623
02:50:47,380 --> 02:50:48,360
Let's stay in the lid.

3624
02:50:48,500 --> 02:50:48,700
Okay.

3625
02:50:50,440 --> 02:50:52,100
Let's swap the tire...

3626
02:50:52,100 --> 02:50:52,320
Okay.

3627
02:50:52,340 --> 02:50:52,980
The baseball...

3628
02:50:52,980 --> 02:50:53,680
We'll swap these.

3629
02:50:54,260 --> 02:50:55,060
And then...

3630
02:50:55,060 --> 02:50:56,360
The tire...

3631
02:50:56,360 --> 02:50:58,420
I'm gonna swap...

3632
02:51:00,220 --> 02:51:00,620
Hello?

3633
02:51:02,180 --> 02:51:03,320
Why can't I swap it?

3634
02:51:06,960 --> 02:51:08,160
Oh, I'm silly.

3635
02:51:08,600 --> 02:51:09,240
There we go.

3636
02:51:09,360 --> 02:51:12,020
Okay, I don't know why it was getting into me.

3637
02:51:12,120 --> 02:51:14,660
Okay, now I'm gonna swap these two.

3638
02:51:15,580 --> 02:51:16,700
Okay, I'm gonna try that.

3639
02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:18,560
And these two.

3640
02:51:19,320 --> 02:51:20,000
There we go.

3641
02:51:22,120 --> 02:51:24,140
Okay, let's attempt this.

3642
02:51:24,700 --> 02:51:26,540
Oh, and now you get out of there.

3643
02:51:27,320 --> 02:51:29,020
We're just gonna put you here, I guess.

3644
02:51:29,620 --> 02:51:31,540
And then we're gonna put you...

3645
02:51:32,780 --> 02:51:33,920
in the basketball.

3646
02:51:34,960 --> 02:51:36,380
Oh shoot, that's right!

3647
02:51:36,400 --> 02:51:36,940
It's too heavy!

3648
02:51:41,400 --> 02:51:42,520
Thank you,

3649
02:51:45,830 --> 02:51:46,330
thank you!

3650
02:51:46,450 --> 02:51:47,910
Sebastian, welcome to membership!

3651
02:51:49,410 --> 02:51:50,350
Ah, that's right!

3652
02:51:50,630 --> 02:51:51,850
That's right, that's right!

3653
02:51:52,590 --> 02:51:56,910
Okay, maybe I have to...

3654
02:52:04,030 --> 02:52:06,370
swap and then be fast about it.

3655
02:52:09,910 --> 02:52:11,130
Oh, no, no, no, no!

3656
02:52:11,370 --> 02:52:12,350
Uh-oh, uh-oh!

3657
02:52:12,610 --> 02:52:13,190
Uh-oh!

3658
02:52:14,630 --> 02:52:14,990
Okay.

3659
02:52:17,190 --> 02:52:18,170
Uh, uh, move?

3660
02:52:18,890 --> 02:52:19,250
Move?

3661
02:52:20,790 --> 02:52:21,150
Ah!

3662
02:52:21,430 --> 02:52:21,790
Okay.

3663
02:52:29,640 --> 02:52:30,260
No, no, no.

3664
02:52:31,180 --> 02:52:32,100
No, no, no!

3665
02:52:35,160 --> 02:52:35,980
There we go, there we go.

3666
02:52:36,260 --> 02:52:36,620
Swap.

3667
02:52:37,220 --> 02:52:37,580
Okay.

3668
02:52:38,020 --> 02:52:38,380
CR.

3669
02:52:39,560 --> 02:52:40,140
There we go.

3670
02:52:40,480 --> 02:52:41,220
Okay, okay, okay.

3671
02:52:43,980 --> 02:52:45,220
Here you come already.

3672
02:52:45,260 --> 02:52:45,560
Here you come already.

3673
02:52:45,580 --> 02:52:47,900
I swear to myself not to repeat my mistakes.

3674
02:52:48,680 --> 02:52:49,160
Mistakes?

3675
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:51,820
When somebody's in trouble, you should lend them a hand.

3676
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:53,760
Otherwise, you'll definitely regret it.

3677
02:52:53,960 --> 02:52:58,180
And now the recklessness of youth has taken over, giving me lightning-fast speed.

3678
02:52:58,920 --> 02:53:00,080
Mmm, I've been thinking.

3679
02:53:00,300 --> 02:53:03,160
If we could stop this man from running, maybe he wouldn't get squished.

3680
02:53:03,540 --> 02:53:07,540
It won't be easy to stop me once the recklessness of youth has taken over.

3681
02:53:08,460 --> 02:53:09,260
Stop him, eh?

3682
02:53:09,360 --> 02:53:11,580
Okay, so maybe now things are heavy enough.

3683
02:53:12,720 --> 02:53:13,200
Right?

3684
02:53:15,500 --> 02:53:15,980
Okay.

3685
02:53:16,080 --> 02:53:16,340
Okay.

3686
02:53:16,440 --> 02:53:17,700
He's not going so fast.

3687
02:53:18,600 --> 02:53:19,260
I think.

3688
02:53:22,620 --> 02:53:23,100
Ah!

3689
02:53:23,340 --> 02:53:24,040
Oh no!

3690
02:53:24,200 --> 02:53:24,480
No!

3691
02:53:24,600 --> 02:53:25,940
I thought I would be able to...

3692
02:53:26,600 --> 02:53:27,080
Oh...

3693
02:53:28,820 --> 02:53:29,300
Oh...

3694
02:53:29,840 --> 02:53:32,640
I thought I'd be able to move while I was launched.

3695
02:53:33,360 --> 02:53:34,480
But I couldn't move.

3696
02:53:34,720 --> 02:53:35,640
Now I'm stuck.

3697
02:53:36,960 --> 02:53:37,440
Ah...

3698
02:53:41,260 --> 02:53:41,740
Okay.

3699
02:53:42,600 --> 02:53:43,740
Well, there was an attempt.

3700
02:53:49,720 --> 02:53:50,940
There was an attempt.

3701
02:53:59,850 --> 02:54:01,670
Time to throw in the trowel.

3702
02:54:03,550 --> 02:54:04,110
Yes.

3703
02:54:05,470 --> 02:54:06,710
Okay, let's retry.

3704
02:54:10,770 --> 02:54:11,330
Hmm...

3705
02:54:29,730 --> 02:54:31,910
Maybe the tire needs to be on here then.

3706
02:54:38,120 --> 02:54:38,680
There.

3707
02:54:48,990 --> 02:54:49,270
Oh!

3708
02:54:49,310 --> 02:54:49,670
No!

3709
02:54:50,510 --> 02:54:51,070
No!

3710
02:54:52,510 --> 02:54:52,610
No!

3711
02:54:53,490 --> 02:54:54,270
Oh my goodness.

3712
02:54:58,350 --> 02:54:58,790
What?

3713
02:54:58,870 --> 02:54:59,150
Why?

3714
02:55:08,100 --> 02:55:10,440
Remember that your goal is to swap the statue with the ball.

3715
02:55:10,520 --> 02:55:11,240
Not to stop him.

3716
02:55:11,420 --> 02:55:12,180
I get that.

3717
02:55:12,820 --> 02:55:14,320
I just need...

3718
02:55:14,860 --> 02:55:18,020
I think when the baseball gets launched...

3719
02:55:18,800 --> 02:55:19,240
Like...

3720
02:55:19,240 --> 02:55:20,940
It just sucks when I get launched.

3721
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:22,540
I can't ghost trick.

3722
02:55:22,740 --> 02:55:25,240
So when I'm in the air, I can't get up there.

3723
02:55:25,820 --> 02:55:26,520
You know?

3724
02:55:26,940 --> 02:55:29,000
And we can't do anything with the...

3725
02:55:29,960 --> 02:55:30,880
With the balloon.

3726
02:55:32,080 --> 02:55:34,300
I'm trying to think of any other shapes that are similar.

3727
02:55:34,360 --> 02:55:35,400
But like the umbrella...

3728
02:55:35,400 --> 02:55:37,860
Even when folded, it's not similar to anything else.

3729
02:55:38,560 --> 02:55:39,260
Even when folded, it's not similar to anything else.

3730
02:55:39,560 --> 02:55:40,480
Even when folded, it's not similar to anything else.

3731
02:55:40,640 --> 02:55:42,200
And we can't reach that.

3732
02:55:42,520 --> 02:55:42,880
And we can't reach that.

3733
02:55:42,880 --> 02:55:43,160
And we can't reach that.

3734
02:55:46,800 --> 02:55:48,340
No, please stop!

3735
02:55:48,700 --> 02:55:49,120
No!

3736
02:55:50,020 --> 02:55:51,180
Please let me...

3737
02:55:51,180 --> 02:55:51,860
You know what, Sissel?

3738
02:55:51,900 --> 02:55:52,440
Get out of the way.

3739
02:55:52,440 --> 02:55:53,940
You go here.

3740
02:55:54,140 --> 02:55:54,360
Okay.

3741
02:55:55,160 --> 02:55:56,740
Yeah, you go here.

3742
02:55:59,760 --> 02:56:00,600
Oh my god.

3743
02:56:00,680 --> 02:56:02,300
I'm gonna become the joker.

3744
02:56:02,520 --> 02:56:03,560
I'm gonna become the joker.

3745
02:56:03,640 --> 02:56:04,080
Please.

3746
02:56:04,820 --> 02:56:06,020
Please just switch!

3747
02:56:07,560 --> 02:56:08,760
Why isn't it working?

3748
02:56:09,300 --> 02:56:10,460
Why isn't it working?

3749
02:56:13,780 --> 02:56:14,340
God!

3750
02:56:15,780 --> 02:56:16,900
Stop, please!

3751
02:56:17,280 --> 02:56:18,060
Oh my god.

3752
02:56:18,060 --> 02:56:18,200
Oh my god.

3753
02:56:34,240 --> 02:56:35,380
Oh, thank god!

3754
02:56:39,720 --> 02:56:40,720
Holy moly.

3755
02:56:44,680 --> 02:56:45,320
Oh yeah.

3756
02:56:45,440 --> 02:56:46,120
We have to wait.

3757
02:56:50,160 --> 02:56:50,880
No, no, no.

3758
02:56:52,960 --> 02:56:54,140
Put you here.

3759
02:56:55,080 --> 02:56:57,120
We're just gonna readjust a few things.

3760
02:56:58,120 --> 02:56:58,620
Maybe...

3761
02:56:59,720 --> 02:57:00,220
Hmm...

3762
02:57:00,220 --> 02:57:03,580
Maybe because it spins so fast, we put the ball in there.

3763
02:57:03,860 --> 02:57:05,520
The baseball might launch!

3764
02:57:06,360 --> 02:57:09,260
Maybe it will launch from the globe.

3765
02:57:10,980 --> 02:57:12,120
He'll spin really fast.

3766
02:57:12,240 --> 02:57:13,100
It will launch from the globe.

3767
02:57:13,180 --> 02:57:14,060
And maybe it will hit the...

3768
02:57:14,060 --> 02:57:16,160
Hit the rugby ball.

3769
02:57:16,500 --> 02:57:18,660
And then we can do something from there.

3770
02:57:18,740 --> 02:57:19,100
Who knows?

3771
02:57:19,700 --> 02:57:21,480
But with the tire here...

3772
02:57:27,730 --> 02:57:28,290
Oh, wait.

3773
02:57:28,450 --> 02:57:30,670
I think I realized I need to...

3774
02:57:30,670 --> 02:57:31,750
Well, let's...

3775
02:57:32,930 --> 02:57:34,150
I think I messed up.

3776
02:57:34,270 --> 02:57:34,830
Okay, hold on.

3777
02:57:34,830 --> 02:57:36,910
I did all that work.

3778
02:57:37,010 --> 02:57:38,850
But I think I need to switch these guys again.

3779
02:57:39,470 --> 02:57:40,690
Whoa, what just happened?

3780
02:57:41,910 --> 02:57:42,430
Um...

3781
02:57:48,100 --> 02:57:49,340
Order of operations.

3782
02:57:49,520 --> 02:57:49,820
Wait.

3783
02:57:50,760 --> 02:57:51,280
Oh...

3784
02:57:57,280 --> 02:58:01,920
Can you spin the climbing frame fast when he's on?

3785
02:58:03,580 --> 02:58:04,100
Oh...

3786
02:58:04,780 --> 02:58:05,540
Oh yeah.

3787
02:58:05,600 --> 02:58:06,600
We can try, right?

3788
02:58:07,840 --> 02:58:08,880
Hold on.

3789
02:58:09,080 --> 02:58:10,880
The order of operations...

3790
02:58:10,880 --> 02:58:11,000
Wait.

3791
02:58:11,480 --> 02:58:13,040
My brain hurts.

3792
02:58:13,820 --> 02:58:14,340
Oh...

3793
02:58:17,240 --> 02:58:18,280
Because I...

3794
02:58:18,280 --> 02:58:20,140
I want the ball...

3795
02:58:20,140 --> 02:58:20,780
Okay, hold on.

3796
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:22,660
Okay, let's switch these back again.

3797
02:58:24,140 --> 02:58:25,180
No, please.

3798
02:58:25,760 --> 02:58:26,280
Okay.

3799
02:58:27,840 --> 02:58:28,580
There we go.

3800
02:58:28,680 --> 02:58:28,940
Switch.

3801
02:58:29,320 --> 02:58:30,900
Even though it took me so long.

3802
02:58:31,820 --> 02:58:33,380
To switch it before.

3803
02:58:34,480 --> 02:58:35,000
Cancel.

3804
02:58:36,740 --> 02:58:37,320
Cancel.

3805
02:58:40,350 --> 02:58:40,860
Go there.

3806
02:58:46,190 --> 02:58:46,950
Oh, oops.

3807
02:58:47,070 --> 02:58:47,530
There we go.

3808
02:58:47,730 --> 02:58:48,070
Okay.

3809
02:58:51,070 --> 02:58:53,250
My brain is hurting a little bit.

3810
02:58:55,190 --> 02:58:56,750
Okay, basketball here.

3811
02:59:00,750 --> 02:59:01,850
And now...

3812
02:59:04,390 --> 02:59:04,970
Switch.

3813
02:59:05,070 --> 02:59:05,530
Okay.

3814
02:59:05,670 --> 02:59:06,890
So let's try this.

3815
02:59:09,150 --> 02:59:09,950
And then...

3816
02:59:11,790 --> 02:59:12,190
Hope.

3817
02:59:21,340 --> 02:59:23,000
Wait, but how long do I...

3818
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:24,320
Oh no.

3819
02:59:26,680 --> 02:59:27,960
It's too heavy to move.

3820
02:59:29,020 --> 02:59:30,460
I can't get over there.

3821
02:59:34,550 --> 02:59:34,950
Okay.

3822
02:59:35,070 --> 02:59:37,270
We're going to have to be the fastest in the west.

3823
02:59:38,950 --> 02:59:40,910
We'd gonna have to be the fastest in the west.

3824
02:59:41,050 --> 02:59:41,210
Oh wait.

3825
02:59:41,310 --> 02:59:41,830
Chris' not so.

3826
02:59:42,970 --> 02:59:43,370
I was going to be faster.

3827
02:59:51,740 --> 02:59:52,140
Ghost!

3828
02:59:52,840 --> 02:59:53,240
Ball!

3829
02:59:59,450 --> 02:59:59,850
Move!

3830
02:59:59,950 --> 03:00:00,110
Move!

3831
03:00:00,250 --> 03:00:00,430
Move!

3832
03:00:00,530 --> 03:00:00,730
Move!

3833
03:00:01,270 --> 03:00:01,670
Ghost!

3834
03:00:16,320 --> 03:00:17,900
This one took me a while.

3835
03:00:18,560 --> 03:00:19,400
Oh my god!

3836
03:00:19,420 --> 03:00:20,180
He's already on it!

3837
03:00:22,520 --> 03:00:23,860
He's already on it!

3838
03:00:31,590 --> 03:00:32,530
I still can't.

3839
03:00:32,610 --> 03:00:32,890
Okay, hold on.

3840
03:00:34,790 --> 03:00:35,190
Okay.

3841
03:00:37,570 --> 03:00:38,190
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

3842
03:00:38,870 --> 03:00:39,410
There we go.

3843
03:00:39,490 --> 03:00:39,790
There we go.

3844
03:00:39,870 --> 03:00:40,150
There we go.

3845
03:00:40,170 --> 03:00:40,510
There we go.

3846
03:00:40,530 --> 03:00:40,910
There we go.

3847
03:00:40,910 --> 03:00:41,270
There we go.

3848
03:00:41,270 --> 03:00:41,610
There we go.

3849
03:00:41,690 --> 03:00:41,950
There we go.

3850
03:00:45,030 --> 03:00:45,350
Okay.

3851
03:00:48,050 --> 03:00:48,370
Spin!

3852
03:00:48,810 --> 03:00:49,130
Spin!

3853
03:00:49,470 --> 03:00:49,790
Spin!

3854
03:00:49,970 --> 03:00:50,390
Spin it!

3855
03:00:50,530 --> 03:00:50,850
Spin!

3856
03:00:51,170 --> 03:00:51,490
Spin!

3857
03:00:54,510 --> 03:00:55,790
Wow, I didn't see this coming.

3858
03:00:55,890 --> 03:00:56,110
Okay.

3859
03:00:58,030 --> 03:01:00,630
Don't you know about the first thing about the globe climber?

3860
03:01:02,210 --> 03:01:05,290
Even little children treat it with the respect it deserves.

3861
03:01:05,290 --> 03:01:08,650
They know that unless you spin it gently, there's no stopping it.

3862
03:01:09,290 --> 03:01:10,610
Yeah, it does look pretty dangerous.

3863
03:01:11,570 --> 03:01:14,670
Looks like I'm just destined to fly through the air like this for a while.

3864
03:01:15,190 --> 03:01:15,590
Hmm.

3865
03:01:15,930 --> 03:01:17,330
This just might buy us some time.

3866
03:01:18,090 --> 03:01:20,690
Maybe he'll just keep spinning around like that for a whole four minutes.

3867
03:01:21,290 --> 03:01:23,470
I'm sorry, but I don't think I would stand it for that long.

3868
03:01:24,050 --> 03:01:26,690
But anyway, at least we stopped him from running for a while.

3869
03:01:27,070 --> 03:01:29,190
Let's see what we can do while we have our chance.

3870
03:01:31,550 --> 03:01:31,950
Okay.

3871
03:01:31,950 --> 03:01:32,150
Okay.

3872
03:01:33,250 --> 03:01:35,350
Wait, there's two boots?

3873
03:01:39,670 --> 03:01:40,590
Look at that.

3874
03:01:40,690 --> 03:01:41,370
There's two boots.

3875
03:01:43,030 --> 03:01:44,070
Okay, great.

3876
03:01:45,180 --> 03:01:45,530
Now...

3877
03:01:49,590 --> 03:01:50,640
Now we...

3878
03:01:59,850 --> 03:02:01,470
You go there.

3879
03:02:02,850 --> 03:02:06,790
Oh my gosh.

3880
03:02:06,870 --> 03:02:07,770
I can barely...

3881
03:02:09,770 --> 03:02:10,070
There we go.

3882
03:02:10,190 --> 03:02:11,550
Okay, we made it!

3883
03:02:13,970 --> 03:02:16,070
Alright, wrestle this.

3884
03:02:16,550 --> 03:02:17,370
Just like before.

3885
03:02:19,350 --> 03:02:20,450
Now we can get up here.

3886
03:02:21,070 --> 03:02:23,110
And we'll close the umbrella.

3887
03:02:26,210 --> 03:02:27,090
And now...

3888
03:02:29,210 --> 03:02:30,770
That was so close!

3889
03:02:31,470 --> 03:02:33,370
If it hit the ball, it would have knocked it down.

3890
03:02:34,610 --> 03:02:36,550
Is that all this umbrella can be used for?

3891
03:02:36,850 --> 03:02:38,410
For knocking the rugby ball down?

3892
03:02:39,770 --> 03:02:41,150
Don't forget about my powers!

3893
03:02:41,870 --> 03:02:43,650
Don't forget about my recklessness of youth!

3894
03:02:46,110 --> 03:02:46,850
Open it up.

3895
03:02:51,990 --> 03:02:52,570
Uh-oh.

3896
03:02:53,750 --> 03:02:54,370
Uh-oh.

3897
03:02:54,470 --> 03:02:55,570
Time is passing!

3898
03:02:56,770 --> 03:02:58,090
Did you see the seesaw?

3899
03:02:58,410 --> 03:03:00,490
I guess the tire is too heavy to get that much height.

3900
03:03:03,090 --> 03:03:05,370
I wouldn't have been surprised if it launched me into the air.

3901
03:03:05,750 --> 03:03:07,970
The tire does have quite a bit of weight to it.

3902
03:03:08,270 --> 03:03:10,310
No matter how heavy it is, I can still swap it.

3903
03:03:15,150 --> 03:03:17,770
Wait, so maybe it shouldn't have been the tire.

3904
03:03:20,510 --> 03:03:24,450
Maybe we need him to jump into the air and flip the umbrella.

3905
03:03:30,370 --> 03:03:30,970
Or something.

3906
03:03:46,830 --> 03:03:49,730
Can he go into the rugby and drop it manually?

3907
03:03:50,070 --> 03:03:50,870
No, unfortunately.

3908
03:03:55,070 --> 03:03:56,050
Unfortunately, we cannot.

3909
03:03:59,810 --> 03:04:01,450
I think I have to restart though.

3910
03:04:07,150 --> 03:04:09,590
It took so long to get here though.

3911
03:04:12,310 --> 03:04:13,870
Basketball did a perfect arc before.

3912
03:04:14,070 --> 03:04:14,790
Now did it.

3913
03:04:15,730 --> 03:04:16,630
The b-ball.

3914
03:04:19,790 --> 03:04:20,310
Okay.

3915
03:04:22,090 --> 03:04:24,010
So we need to move the...

3916
03:04:24,010 --> 03:04:25,830
We need to move...

3917
03:04:26,430 --> 03:04:26,910
The...

3918
03:04:27,990 --> 03:04:28,470
The...

3919
03:04:29,330 --> 03:04:29,810
Baseball...

3920
03:04:29,810 --> 03:04:30,230
Wait, no.

3921
03:04:39,380 --> 03:04:41,560
But we still need the baseball in here.

3922
03:04:42,860 --> 03:04:46,340
So we're just swapping the baseball and the basketball then.

3923
03:04:46,380 --> 03:04:46,820
Is that it?

3924
03:04:48,420 --> 03:04:50,420
We don't have to worry about the tire?

3925
03:05:00,010 --> 03:05:00,970
Thank you!

3926
03:05:04,750 --> 03:05:05,230
I

3927
03:05:14,850 --> 03:05:16,110
think I have to reset.

3928
03:05:16,110 --> 03:05:18,370
I think I've already missed my chance.

3929
03:05:19,710 --> 03:05:24,270
I think if by the time he's there, it's not completed.

3930
03:05:24,590 --> 03:05:25,410
It's not good.

3931
03:05:26,110 --> 03:05:27,030
I think...

3932
03:05:32,220 --> 03:05:34,640
I think I'm not good.

3933
03:05:35,340 --> 03:05:35,860
Right?

3934
03:05:39,510 --> 03:05:40,810
You have everything you need?

3935
03:05:40,950 --> 03:05:41,630
It's just execution.

3936
03:05:44,270 --> 03:05:46,030
I mean, I always had everything I needed.

3937
03:05:51,830 --> 03:05:52,230
Okay.

3938
03:05:54,790 --> 03:05:55,950
I'm gonna just retry.

3939
03:05:55,990 --> 03:05:58,250
I'm gonna retry with what we know now.

3940
03:05:59,910 --> 03:06:00,310
So...

3941
03:06:02,090 --> 03:06:02,490
Hmm.

3942
03:06:02,610 --> 03:06:02,970
Okay.

3943
03:06:04,470 --> 03:06:05,750
I think it was a super chat.

3944
03:06:05,810 --> 03:06:06,610
I don't know what it said though.

3945
03:06:07,330 --> 03:06:07,790
All right.

3946
03:06:07,810 --> 03:06:08,090
Here we go.

3947
03:06:08,190 --> 03:06:08,410
Oh.

3948
03:06:08,430 --> 03:06:08,750
Oh.

3949
03:06:08,830 --> 03:06:09,010
Oh.

3950
03:06:09,250 --> 03:06:09,650
Whoopsie.

3951
03:06:09,650 --> 03:06:09,930
Whoopsie.

3952
03:06:10,850 --> 03:06:11,250
Okay.

3953
03:06:11,370 --> 03:06:11,730
Here we go.

3954
03:06:12,870 --> 03:06:13,850
La, la, la.

3955
03:06:15,170 --> 03:06:16,010
La, la, la.

3956
03:06:18,370 --> 03:06:19,670
Move the seesaw.

3957
03:06:21,570 --> 03:06:22,770
Into the seabow.

3958
03:06:24,050 --> 03:06:25,110
Seesaw go back down.

3959
03:06:26,470 --> 03:06:27,550
Here he comes.

3960
03:06:27,590 --> 03:06:28,330
Oh my gosh.

3961
03:06:28,430 --> 03:06:28,690
Already?

3962
03:06:30,030 --> 03:06:30,510
Okay.

3963
03:06:47,290 --> 03:06:47,930
Oh, wait.

3964
03:06:48,210 --> 03:06:50,830
Actually, you go here.

3965
03:06:52,290 --> 03:06:52,770
There.

3966
03:06:54,110 --> 03:06:56,870
Just a little bit of moving around a little bit.

3967
03:06:58,210 --> 03:06:58,690
Swap.

3968
03:06:58,730 --> 03:06:58,870
Swap.

3969
03:06:59,390 --> 03:06:59,850
Okay.

3970
03:06:59,850 --> 03:07:04,450
And now we wait for him to spin so we can get on.

3971
03:07:07,490 --> 03:07:08,590
So he can get on.

3972
03:07:13,750 --> 03:07:14,210
Oh.

3973
03:07:14,510 --> 03:07:14,970
Oh.

3974
03:07:15,070 --> 03:07:15,330
Oh.

3975
03:07:15,330 --> 03:07:15,790
There we go.

3976
03:07:16,110 --> 03:07:16,570
Oh.

3977
03:07:16,630 --> 03:07:17,030
Wrong.

3978
03:07:17,170 --> 03:07:17,390
Wrong.

3979
03:07:17,410 --> 03:07:17,650
Wrong.

3980
03:07:17,650 --> 03:07:17,950
Wrong.

3981
03:07:17,950 --> 03:07:18,290
Wrong.

3982
03:07:19,090 --> 03:07:19,550
Oh.

3983
03:07:19,690 --> 03:07:20,110
No.

3984
03:07:20,270 --> 03:07:20,530
No.

3985
03:07:20,530 --> 03:07:20,750
No.

3986
03:07:20,750 --> 03:07:21,350
Oh my gosh.

3987
03:07:21,370 --> 03:07:22,870
I'm pressing all the wrong buttons now.

3988
03:07:23,270 --> 03:07:23,730
Okay.

3989
03:07:24,810 --> 03:07:26,350
Now we spin.

3990
03:07:26,890 --> 03:07:27,350
Spin.

3991
03:07:27,370 --> 03:07:27,570
Spin.

3992
03:07:37,080 --> 03:07:37,600
Spin.

3993
03:07:37,600 --> 03:07:37,820
Restore!

3994
03:07:40,720 --> 03:07:41,240
Now.

3995
03:07:41,400 --> 03:07:44,040
The question is do I need the umbrella open or closed?

3996
03:07:44,400 --> 03:07:45,820
I'm not quite sure.

3997
03:07:46,900 --> 03:07:47,920
At this part.

3998
03:07:48,580 --> 03:07:50,440
I'm gonna try with it open.

3999
03:07:50,620 --> 03:07:51,460
I don't know why.

4000
03:07:51,760 --> 03:07:52,460
Oops, oops, my bad.

4001
03:07:53,080 --> 03:07:53,600
Okay.

4002
03:07:56,320 --> 03:08:00,320
Okay, now I'm gonna wait.

4003
03:08:02,940 --> 03:08:03,460
Oh.

4004
03:08:07,270 --> 03:08:08,830
Oh, what did that just do?

4005
03:08:09,490 --> 03:08:10,010
Okay.

4006
03:08:10,010 --> 03:08:10,210
Hahaha!

4007
03:08:11,110 --> 03:08:13,150
I so did not see that coming.

4008
03:08:14,990 --> 03:08:17,350
Oh, I never thought the umbrella would catch the ball.

4009
03:08:17,870 --> 03:08:18,710
Did you see that?

4010
03:08:18,770 --> 03:08:20,030
The tree branch, it shook a little.

4011
03:08:20,650 --> 03:08:21,950
I think I saw it shake too.

4012
03:08:22,630 --> 03:08:24,090
If only it shook a little more.

4013
03:08:25,050 --> 03:08:27,470
It would knock that terrible rugby ball down.

4014
03:08:28,010 --> 03:08:29,450
From this terrible tree!

4015
03:08:30,730 --> 03:08:32,570
Maybe it just needs a little more weight.

4016
03:08:36,650 --> 03:08:39,070
Sure we can do this, we just have to put our heads together.

4017
03:08:39,070 --> 03:08:41,350
Okay, well I'm doing all the thinking right now, Missile.

4018
03:08:41,410 --> 03:08:43,390
So I could really appreciate if you just...

4019
03:08:44,750 --> 03:08:47,670
Everything looks good so far, we just need one more step.

4020
03:08:48,910 --> 03:08:49,630
The tire...

4021
03:08:50,650 --> 03:08:51,690
Wait, do I have to restart?

4022
03:09:09,200 --> 03:09:09,920
Oh, wait!

4023
03:09:10,140 --> 03:09:11,420
I get it, I get it, I get it!

4024
03:09:26,650 --> 03:09:27,670
What do you think, Missile?

4025
03:09:29,430 --> 03:09:31,010
Okay, I think you can do it.

4026
03:09:31,190 --> 03:09:33,530
With the ball there, I think I can do it!

4027
03:09:34,810 --> 03:09:36,830
In just a few seconds, you'll swap me.

4028
03:09:36,830 --> 03:09:37,430
Mino with the leaf.

4029
03:09:37,610 --> 03:09:40,150
And then from there, you can swap Mino with one...

4030
03:09:40,150 --> 03:09:41,390
Mino, one more time!

4031
03:09:41,970 --> 03:09:43,870
The final moment is near, Missile, are you ready?

4032
03:09:44,570 --> 03:09:45,370
You bet!

4033
03:09:46,650 --> 03:09:47,050
Okay.

4034
03:09:47,530 --> 03:09:48,330
Don't mess it up.

4035
03:09:49,710 --> 03:09:50,930
I'm going ghost!

4036
03:09:54,870 --> 03:09:55,270
Okay.

4037
03:09:56,230 --> 03:09:58,630
I have to wait for it to start falling, don't I?

4038
03:10:00,170 --> 03:10:01,330
Yeah, I can't reach it.

4039
03:10:01,390 --> 03:10:02,710
I have to wait for it to start falling.

4040
03:10:02,950 --> 03:10:03,590
Okay, here we go.

4041
03:10:12,520 --> 03:10:14,600
Please don't make me have to do all this over again.

4042
03:10:22,200 --> 03:10:22,600
Please!

4043
03:10:24,020 --> 03:10:25,280
Oh, there we go, okay.

4044
03:10:25,600 --> 03:10:26,800
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

4045
03:10:28,020 --> 03:10:28,420
Okay.

4046
03:10:29,520 --> 03:10:30,660
Watch me sizzle!

4047
03:10:30,780 --> 03:10:31,440
Here I go!

4048
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:33,160
Oh, it did it for me, that's so nice.

4049
03:10:33,520 --> 03:10:34,420
The finishing touches.

4050
03:10:34,540 --> 03:10:35,480
You can do it, Missile.

4051
03:10:35,700 --> 03:10:36,980
Swap Mino with that ball.

4052
03:10:40,480 --> 03:10:40,880
Swap.

4053
03:10:43,280 --> 03:10:44,060
Oh, okay.

4054
03:10:45,580 --> 03:10:47,340
I didn't have to time anything at all.

4055
03:10:47,680 --> 03:10:48,160
Nice.

4056
03:10:49,300 --> 03:10:49,780
Woohoo!

4057
03:10:53,480 --> 03:10:54,160
How's that?

4058
03:10:55,320 --> 03:10:56,720
My head has been spared.

4059
03:10:57,560 --> 03:10:59,660
Surely that was a try worthy of the gods.

4060
03:11:00,440 --> 03:11:02,220
Now Mino is right where he belongs.

4061
03:11:02,940 --> 03:11:05,000
Okay, we did it again, didn't we?

4062
03:11:07,080 --> 03:11:07,740
Didn't we?

4063
03:11:07,880 --> 03:11:09,640
Yeah, he's still in the same...

4064
03:11:10,280 --> 03:11:11,240
Same position.

4065
03:11:11,240 --> 03:11:11,860
Hahaha.

4066
03:11:12,840 --> 03:11:14,200
Nobody has to die.

4067
03:11:15,180 --> 03:11:15,740
Missile.

4068
03:11:16,040 --> 03:11:17,680
Good job, Missile and Minto.

4069
03:11:17,880 --> 03:11:19,080
Nice, Missile.

4070
03:11:24,190 --> 03:11:25,490
Missile and Minto.

4071
03:11:27,230 --> 03:11:29,310
Except for one brave little somebody.

4072
03:11:30,090 --> 03:11:30,650
Huh?

4073
03:11:31,490 --> 03:11:33,570
I'm talking about you, Missile.

4074
03:11:34,510 --> 03:11:35,270
Oh, me?

4075
03:11:35,570 --> 03:11:36,610
I guess you're right.

4076
03:11:36,690 --> 03:11:37,670
I'm still dead, aren't I?

4077
03:11:38,590 --> 03:11:40,710
So now let's go back and save your life.

4078
03:11:42,990 --> 03:11:43,730
Wait a minute.

4079
03:11:44,650 --> 03:11:45,370
What is it?

4080
03:11:46,310 --> 03:11:47,750
Now that I think about it...

4081
03:11:47,750 --> 03:11:50,090
I think I want to stay dead a little longer.

4082
03:11:50,270 --> 03:11:50,670
Oh, okay.

4083
03:11:51,550 --> 03:11:51,910
What?

4084
03:11:52,710 --> 03:11:55,490
When I was alive, I couldn't even help Miss Camilla when she was in trouble.

4085
03:11:56,030 --> 03:11:57,710
I want to be able to protect Miss Camilla.

4086
03:11:58,470 --> 03:12:01,290
And to do that, I need these powers I have now.

4087
03:12:04,890 --> 03:12:05,450
I see.

4088
03:12:07,130 --> 03:12:07,850
Perfectly understandable.

4089
03:12:08,690 --> 03:12:10,330
Even I wish I had powers like that.

4090
03:12:10,970 --> 03:12:12,150
Hey, we just saved you.

4091
03:12:12,210 --> 03:12:13,370
Don't wish your life away already.

4092
03:12:15,230 --> 03:12:15,930
Of course.

4093
03:12:15,970 --> 03:12:16,390
You're right.

4094
03:12:16,570 --> 03:12:17,670
You're such a good boy.

4095
03:12:18,450 --> 03:12:19,250
Okay, Missile.

4096
03:12:19,310 --> 03:12:19,910
Have it your way.

4097
03:12:22,050 --> 03:12:23,570
By the way, Mr. Reckless Youth.

4098
03:12:23,890 --> 03:12:26,690
There's a certain detective who needs that music box you found.

4099
03:12:30,010 --> 03:12:31,650
Oh, he's such a good boy.

4100
03:12:31,650 --> 03:12:32,010
Oh.

4101
03:12:38,450 --> 03:12:41,450
When we get back to the present time, could you give it to her?

4102
03:12:42,550 --> 03:12:42,950
Certainly.

4103
03:12:42,950 --> 03:12:43,950
You have my word.

4104
03:12:48,310 --> 03:12:49,730
Let's go back to the present.

4105
03:12:59,080 --> 03:12:59,480
Okay.

4106
03:12:59,720 --> 03:13:00,280
Oh my god.

4107
03:13:00,320 --> 03:13:00,940
He's still there.

4108
03:13:02,220 --> 03:13:04,780
And so Camilla ended up in the hands of the kidnappers.

4109
03:13:04,900 --> 03:13:06,520
We weren't able to change that part.

4110
03:13:08,240 --> 03:13:11,520
Wait, but we don't want her to have the music box.

4111
03:13:11,820 --> 03:13:12,180
Oh, no.

4112
03:13:12,260 --> 03:13:12,480
Wait.

4113
03:13:12,580 --> 03:13:13,040
We want...

4114
03:13:13,040 --> 03:13:14,860
Yeah, she threw the music box in there.

4115
03:13:14,960 --> 03:13:15,840
Now he's going to wake up.

4116
03:13:16,260 --> 03:13:17,480
Now Lin is going to get it.

4117
03:13:17,500 --> 03:13:17,780
That's right.

4118
03:13:18,440 --> 03:13:18,840
Ugh.

4119
03:13:19,460 --> 03:13:20,820
Missile is a diamond dog.

4120
03:13:24,960 --> 03:13:27,200
Lin listened to my story without saying anything.

4121
03:13:28,780 --> 03:13:29,420
I'm sorry.

4122
03:13:29,540 --> 03:13:31,020
I wish there was something else I could have done.

4123
03:13:32,220 --> 03:13:33,660
No, you did the best you could.

4124
03:13:34,540 --> 03:13:36,120
I'm sure she's all right after all.

4125
03:13:36,720 --> 03:13:37,980
After all, she has me.

4126
03:13:41,780 --> 03:13:42,200
Missile!

4127
03:13:44,980 --> 03:13:45,400
Missile?

4128
03:13:45,480 --> 03:13:46,400
Are you in there?

4129
03:13:50,210 --> 03:13:50,770
Missile!

4130
03:13:50,990 --> 03:13:52,650
Leave Miss Camilla to me!

4131
03:13:53,690 --> 03:13:55,550
I know I don't look much like...

4132
03:13:55,550 --> 03:13:56,230
Much...

4133
03:13:56,230 --> 03:13:56,790
Look...

4134
03:13:56,790 --> 03:13:57,330
Like...

4135
03:13:57,330 --> 03:13:58,290
Much right now.

4136
03:13:58,630 --> 03:14:00,330
But I'm sure I can help her.

4137
03:14:03,850 --> 03:14:04,410
Missile...

4138
03:14:05,530 --> 03:14:07,610
Bye, Missile!

4139
03:14:09,970 --> 03:14:10,530
Missile!

4140
03:14:13,350 --> 03:14:14,230
Oh, no!

4141
03:14:19,590 --> 03:14:21,390
I'm going to leave it up to Missile.

4142
03:14:21,430 --> 03:14:21,990
What are you talking about?

4143
03:14:22,010 --> 03:14:22,670
Go back to Kyojin!

4144
03:14:29,400 --> 03:14:29,840
But they're waiting for me...

4145
03:14:29,840 --> 03:14:30,440
Oh my god.

4146
03:14:31,200 --> 03:14:34,160
It kind of looks like Missile is being left up to the wind.

4147
03:14:36,300 --> 03:14:37,180
He's alive!

4148
03:14:42,440 --> 03:14:45,620
I have something to give to you.

4149
03:14:47,380 --> 03:14:48,200
Ta-down...

4150
03:14:48,200 --> 03:14:49,320
No, not!

4151
03:14:49,580 --> 03:14:52,000
Stop the park from make turn into a housing site.

4152
03:14:52,160 --> 03:14:53,160
Protect the park.

4153
03:14:53,220 --> 03:14:54,020
The rock of the gods.

4154
03:14:55,020 --> 03:14:55,980
Aren't you forgetting food?

4155
03:14:57,920 --> 03:14:59,520
Oh, pardon me, pardon me.

4156
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:03,480
He's going on an adventure.

4157
03:15:03,940 --> 03:15:05,740
My apologies, this is for you!

4158
03:15:08,620 --> 03:15:10,320
Gonna need some more water soon.

4159
03:15:12,980 --> 03:15:15,040
You kept the music box safe, didn't you?

4160
03:15:15,180 --> 03:15:15,680
Thank you!

4161
03:15:18,140 --> 03:15:18,940
Not at all.

4162
03:15:19,080 --> 03:15:21,120
I was only doing what the Rock of the Gods...

4163
03:15:22,900 --> 03:15:24,280
would have wanted.

4164
03:15:25,520 --> 03:15:27,080
Does he have a concussion or something?

4165
03:15:27,300 --> 03:15:28,200
What's wrong with him?

4166
03:15:29,340 --> 03:15:30,240
Mega pocket.

4167
03:15:30,520 --> 03:15:31,220
What's the matter?

4168
03:15:31,300 --> 03:15:32,100
Cat got your tongue?

4169
03:15:32,300 --> 03:15:33,720
I think he thinks she's really pretty.

4170
03:15:35,060 --> 03:15:36,320
He's mesmerized...

4171
03:15:36,320 --> 03:15:37,100
by my beauty!

4172
03:15:41,320 --> 03:15:41,800
Hey!

4173
03:15:42,200 --> 03:15:44,260
The cat's not allowed to get your tongue!

4174
03:15:48,270 --> 03:15:49,090
Missiles averted.

4175
03:15:49,710 --> 03:15:50,570
Evade, evade!

4176
03:15:53,570 --> 03:15:55,210
Excuse me, but are you...

4177
03:15:56,470 --> 03:15:57,670
No, it couldn't be!

4178
03:15:59,130 --> 03:16:00,190
Have we met before?

4179
03:16:01,150 --> 03:16:02,010
Aren't you...

4180
03:16:02,790 --> 03:16:05,950
that little girl from that time?

4181
03:16:07,650 --> 03:16:08,830
I'll never forget it!

4182
03:16:08,870 --> 03:16:10,330
It was ten years ago in this park!

4183
03:16:11,370 --> 03:16:11,930
Shaggy!

4184
03:16:12,810 --> 03:16:13,550
Shaggy too!

4185
03:16:14,250 --> 03:16:16,410
Are you talking about...

4186
03:16:19,190 --> 03:16:19,750
Uh...

4187
03:16:26,160 --> 03:16:28,820
Here in this park, the gods surely control fate.

4188
03:16:29,200 --> 03:16:32,420
Today, ten years from that day, we meet once again.

4189
03:16:33,880 --> 03:16:36,440
If that isn't the power of the gods, then what else is it?

4190
03:16:37,980 --> 03:16:39,280
It could just be coincidence.

4191
03:16:39,520 --> 03:16:41,560
I can't believe it!

4192
03:16:42,040 --> 03:16:44,020
But apparently you know our lady detective here.

4193
03:16:45,100 --> 03:16:46,400
Could you tell us about it?

4194
03:16:46,440 --> 03:16:47,700
What happened ten years ago?

4195
03:16:48,780 --> 03:16:49,740
Yes, yes, of course!

4196
03:16:49,840 --> 03:16:51,400
I was actually about to do just that.

4197
03:16:53,060 --> 03:16:54,080
Rock of the gods.

4198
03:16:55,120 --> 03:16:57,340
What about this rock of the gods you keep mentioning?

4199
03:16:57,840 --> 03:16:58,520
Don't you know?

4200
03:16:58,580 --> 03:16:59,800
It's right there in front of us!

4201
03:17:00,260 --> 03:17:00,880
Me know?

4202
03:17:03,200 --> 03:17:04,120
Oh no, this place.

4203
03:17:09,240 --> 03:17:09,640
Missile!

4204
03:17:21,880 --> 03:17:22,840
Wait a minute.

4205
03:17:24,080 --> 03:17:26,160
You say gods, but do you mean dogs?

4206
03:17:27,140 --> 03:17:28,500
Of course not, don't be silly.

4207
03:17:28,840 --> 03:17:30,700
This is no time for ridiculous word games.

4208
03:17:31,520 --> 03:17:32,020
You are right.

4209
03:17:32,020 --> 03:17:33,660
You were standing just above the rock of the gods.

4210
03:17:34,620 --> 03:17:37,060
Wait, you were standing just above the rock of the gods now.

4211
03:17:37,820 --> 03:17:39,260
Take a good look at that monument.

4212
03:17:40,680 --> 03:17:41,120
Monument?

4213
03:17:44,260 --> 03:17:46,180
Rock of the gods, Temsec Park.

4214
03:17:47,940 --> 03:17:50,900
The rock of the... this took a turn that I did not expect at all.

4215
03:17:51,160 --> 03:17:53,500
I mean, we've been dealing with...

4216
03:17:56,020 --> 03:18:01,660
We've been dealing with ghosts and all sorts of supernatural stuff.

4217
03:18:01,660 --> 03:18:03,280
But I did not... I don't know...

4218
03:18:05,140 --> 03:18:08,300
I don't... I did not expect something like this.

4219
03:18:08,580 --> 03:18:10,740
The rock is buried in the ground right there.

4220
03:18:10,820 --> 03:18:12,460
It's been there these ten years.

4221
03:18:15,820 --> 03:18:19,240
Ever since that day it flew down from the heavens and showed us a miracle.

4222
03:18:21,020 --> 03:18:21,540
Ever since that day it flew down from the heavens and showed us a miracle.

4223
03:18:21,540 --> 03:18:21,980
A miracle?

4224
03:18:27,470 --> 03:18:29,610
So this rock you've been talking about...

4225
03:18:30,490 --> 03:18:31,990
is a meteorite.

4226
03:18:33,210 --> 03:18:33,730
Precisely.

4227
03:18:35,370 --> 03:18:37,210
It's not a... it's not a rock.

4228
03:18:37,650 --> 03:18:38,130
It's not a...

4229
03:18:38,130 --> 03:18:38,130
it's not a rock.

4230
03:18:38,130 --> 03:18:39,150
Wait, it's the opposite.

4231
03:18:39,330 --> 03:18:40,130
It's not a boulder.

4232
03:18:40,730 --> 03:18:41,870
It's a rock.

4233
03:18:43,190 --> 03:18:44,370
It's a rock.

4234
03:18:45,630 --> 03:18:48,190
It dropped from the sky on that day ten years ago.

4235
03:18:48,450 --> 03:18:49,270
Yes, of course.

4236
03:18:49,910 --> 03:18:51,430
Surely you know all about it.

4237
03:18:51,930 --> 03:18:52,410
Me?

4238
03:18:57,930 --> 03:18:59,030
Wait, so did the...

4239
03:18:59,030 --> 03:19:02,010
Did the rock, like, strike the guy?

4240
03:19:02,810 --> 03:19:03,770
Did the rock, like, strike the guy?

4241
03:19:03,790 --> 03:19:06,310
So the detective didn't actually shoot and kill the person?

4242
03:19:10,490 --> 03:19:12,990
That day I just happened to be passing through this park.

4243
03:19:13,190 --> 03:19:15,430
I had no idea that day would change my destiny.

4244
03:19:18,250 --> 03:19:20,490
The sun was going down and through the gloom...

4245
03:19:20,950 --> 03:19:22,810
I heard the scream of a little girl.

4246
03:19:28,670 --> 03:19:30,810
Now just calm down and drop that weapon.

4247
03:19:31,270 --> 03:19:32,030
Stay back.

4248
03:19:32,070 --> 03:19:33,910
If you come any closer, I'll shoot her.

4249
03:19:36,410 --> 03:19:37,250
Oh my god.

4250
03:19:42,090 --> 03:19:44,150
That's not Cabanela, is it?

4251
03:19:44,550 --> 03:19:45,030
No.

4252
03:19:46,430 --> 03:19:48,110
No, no, because the guy died.

4253
03:19:48,310 --> 03:19:49,470
But look at that stance.

4254
03:19:50,470 --> 03:19:53,090
It looks very skinny and tall.

4255
03:19:56,990 --> 03:19:58,930
I peeked out fearfully from the bushes.

4256
03:19:59,130 --> 03:20:00,550
And saw some shadowy figures.

4257
03:20:02,690 --> 03:20:04,690
I didn't see the face of the criminal clearly.

4258
03:20:05,230 --> 03:20:06,790
I knew I should do something to help him.

4259
03:20:06,790 --> 03:20:07,630
But I couldn't move.

4260
03:20:10,070 --> 03:20:12,050
The tension was so thick, it was painful.

4261
03:20:12,610 --> 03:20:14,470
Just when I couldn't stand it any longer.

4262
03:20:15,070 --> 03:20:16,030
That's when it happened.

4263
03:20:16,230 --> 03:20:18,050
The sky suddenly burned bluish white.

4264
03:20:23,610 --> 03:20:25,870
I came crashing down on him.

4265
03:20:29,910 --> 03:20:31,370
When I crashed into the ground.

4266
03:20:33,710 --> 03:20:37,030
The meteorite gave off a shower of beautiful fragments.

4267
03:20:37,410 --> 03:20:37,570
Oh!

4268
03:20:38,630 --> 03:20:41,190
This is how we get the ghost trick.

4269
03:20:41,670 --> 03:20:52,410
If you die, where the meteorite has been, little pieces, That's why missiles are more powerful than ours.

4270
03:20:54,470 --> 03:20:56,710
Because I am a star!

4271
03:21:02,450 --> 03:21:07,550
That's why, because This missile died right next to the biggest chunk of the meteorite.

4272
03:21:08,870 --> 03:21:09,990
And maybe...

4273
03:21:09,990 --> 03:21:13,430
The guy that died by the meteor...

4274
03:21:13,430 --> 03:21:15,030
is the manipulator!

4275
03:21:18,210 --> 03:21:19,330
Stellar, stellar...

4276
03:21:20,290 --> 03:21:23,030
The meteorite gave off a shower of beautiful fragments.

4277
03:21:23,290 --> 03:21:23,930
Oh my god.

4278
03:21:24,310 --> 03:21:25,350
It's just like...

4279
03:21:25,350 --> 03:21:26,330
Oh my gosh, you know what it is?

4280
03:21:26,450 --> 03:21:28,190
It's just like the Shikan jewel from Inuyasha.

4281
03:21:29,090 --> 03:21:30,330
And then I saw it.

4282
03:21:30,370 --> 03:21:32,270
One of those beautiful fragments...

4283
03:21:32,270 --> 03:21:34,470
pierced into the criminal's back!

4284
03:21:39,700 --> 03:21:41,480
That's why he's the manipulator.

4285
03:21:42,560 --> 03:21:44,420
He's got the power of the rock!

4286
03:21:45,600 --> 03:21:48,760
The judgment of the gods was brought down on the park that day.

4287
03:21:55,130 --> 03:21:56,330
Ten years ago...

4288
03:21:56,330 --> 03:21:58,450
The little girl that was you...

4289
03:21:58,450 --> 03:22:00,430
was saved by the rock of the gods.

4290
03:22:01,530 --> 03:22:02,910
Why, I can't believe it!

4291
03:22:03,990 --> 03:22:06,450
The rock of the gods was given the name Temsik.

4292
03:22:06,770 --> 03:22:08,010
And still today...

4293
03:22:08,010 --> 03:22:10,690
It lies sleeping deep in the park's earth.

4294
03:22:11,690 --> 03:22:12,410
So...

4295
03:22:13,790 --> 03:22:16,070
Where we died, there was a fragment.

4296
03:22:19,690 --> 03:22:20,850
Maybe not a fragment.

4297
03:22:21,630 --> 03:22:23,590
Maybe what that guy...

4298
03:22:23,590 --> 03:22:25,690
The scientist in the park!

4299
03:22:25,830 --> 03:22:26,670
Wasn't he studying?

4300
03:22:27,770 --> 03:22:29,390
Wasn't he studying the...

4301
03:22:29,830 --> 03:22:30,790
The rocks?

4302
03:22:35,310 --> 03:22:37,910
He was studying the rocks in the...

4303
03:22:37,910 --> 03:22:38,830
In his little lab!

4304
03:22:45,030 --> 03:22:46,790
Maybe that's why we have the powers.

4305
03:22:48,970 --> 03:22:49,450
Temsik.

4306
03:22:50,470 --> 03:22:52,350
I never knew about this Temsik.

4307
03:22:54,750 --> 03:22:57,370
I always thought Detective Joud was the one who saved me.

4308
03:22:58,030 --> 03:22:59,410
You were very young then.

4309
03:22:59,770 --> 03:23:02,450
And you passed out from the shock of being taken hostage.

4310
03:23:02,450 --> 03:23:04,010
Of course you wouldn't remember.

4311
03:23:05,590 --> 03:23:06,510
But that's funny.

4312
03:23:06,730 --> 03:23:09,530
A huge incident like that should have caused quite a stir.

4313
03:23:10,430 --> 03:23:12,050
It's strange you never heard of it, Lin.

4314
03:23:13,050 --> 03:23:14,070
It is, isn't it?

4315
03:23:14,170 --> 03:23:15,410
But now I think about it.

4316
03:23:15,530 --> 03:23:17,630
I remember I didn't want to think about what happened.

4317
03:23:17,830 --> 03:23:20,410
I avoided the news and I never came back to this park again.

4318
03:23:21,170 --> 03:23:22,930
That's why I didn't know anything about it.

4319
03:23:24,150 --> 03:23:24,590
Whoa...

4320
03:23:26,690 --> 03:23:28,790
The meteorite was named Temsik after the...

4321
03:23:28,790 --> 03:23:31,230
After the name of this park that it fell in.

4322
03:23:31,230 --> 03:23:33,450
And then the Rock of the Gods was forgotten.

4323
03:23:34,410 --> 03:23:36,070
Now an awful thing is happening.

4324
03:23:36,310 --> 03:23:38,830
They're talking about turning the park into a housing site.

4325
03:23:39,150 --> 03:23:41,370
I'll never forget the miracle I witnessed that day.

4326
03:23:41,830 --> 03:23:45,350
And so I've taken up residence in this park and I'm trying to appeal to the people.

4327
03:23:46,190 --> 03:23:47,130
Protect the park!

4328
03:23:47,250 --> 03:23:48,410
Protect the Rock of the Gods!

4329
03:23:48,690 --> 03:23:49,670
That is my mission!

4330
03:23:51,210 --> 03:23:52,210
What's a kismet?

4331
03:23:52,250 --> 03:23:53,510
I keep seeing people saying that.

4332
03:23:53,570 --> 03:23:53,950
What is that?

4333
03:23:55,330 --> 03:23:56,030
I see.

4334
03:23:59,910 --> 03:24:01,970
The real mystery is how old is this guy.

4335
03:24:01,970 --> 03:24:03,110
I was thinking that too.

4336
03:24:04,150 --> 03:24:05,210
Oh, it means fate.

4337
03:24:07,810 --> 03:24:08,990
I see, I see.

4338
03:24:10,090 --> 03:24:11,610
I'm taking you with me, missile.

4339
03:24:14,270 --> 03:24:14,670
Fragment.

4340
03:24:19,700 --> 03:24:23,480
So ten years ago, the little girl that was Lin wasn't aware of the meteorite.

4341
03:24:24,080 --> 03:24:24,860
I get that.

4342
03:24:24,980 --> 03:24:26,660
But Detective Jowd, on the other hand...

4343
03:24:26,660 --> 03:24:29,060
There's no way he didn't know about this Temsik thing.

4344
03:24:29,640 --> 03:24:30,920
And if he knew...

4345
03:24:32,480 --> 03:24:33,480
Then the man died.

4346
03:24:33,480 --> 03:24:34,420
I took his life.

4347
03:24:36,400 --> 03:24:38,660
What was that confession of his all about?

4348
03:24:38,940 --> 03:24:41,400
I think Detective Jowd is just stupid.

4349
03:24:43,600 --> 03:24:45,860
I think kismet means Jaeger.

4350
03:24:47,780 --> 03:24:50,220
Jowd Hunter is his real name.

4351
03:24:55,610 --> 03:24:59,730
If kismet equals fate, Temsik equals reversed fate.

4352
03:25:00,090 --> 03:25:01,610
I like that!

4353
03:25:02,030 --> 03:25:04,190
Oh, that's so big brain.

4354
03:25:04,190 --> 03:25:06,130
Because we're reversing their fates.

4355
03:25:06,910 --> 03:25:08,050
That's so cool.

4356
03:25:10,670 --> 03:25:11,190
Yeah.

4357
03:25:11,430 --> 03:25:12,710
Detective Jowd.

4358
03:25:12,710 --> 03:25:13,750
Like, what the hell?

4359
03:25:15,810 --> 03:25:18,270
Why are you always like...

4360
03:25:18,270 --> 03:25:19,730
Yeah, I killed this guy.

4361
03:25:20,010 --> 03:25:21,230
No, you didn't.

4362
03:25:21,230 --> 03:25:22,410
And also...

4363
03:25:22,410 --> 03:25:24,110
Oh, yeah, I killed the wife.

4364
03:25:24,370 --> 03:25:25,630
No, you didn't.

4365
03:25:25,850 --> 03:25:29,810
What is the point of being the hero in this situation?

4366
03:25:31,170 --> 03:25:33,130
What was that confession of his all about?

4367
03:25:43,670 --> 03:25:47,110
Tell me all the others about the movie.

4368
03:25:47,710 --> 03:25:48,430
It's a little...

4369
03:25:48,430 --> 03:25:49,150
The gaming industry is really interesting.

4370
03:25:49,150 --> 03:25:50,230
There are things I learned from this movie.

4371
03:25:50,230 --> 03:25:51,130
Finally, the discussion for this underいます maidamara o Morgan.

4372
03:25:51,130 --> 03:25:53,010
I played官石間.

4373
03:25:53,330 --> 03:25:54,750
It means sometimes the king is killed for the princess Many times in the past.

4374
03:25:55,450 --> 03:25:55,490
Yeah.

4375
03:25:59,970 --> 03:26:01,090
Kleff talk!

4376
03:26:01,090 --> 03:26:02,830
Cicel is on a pond when a pebble is dropped in.

4377
03:26:03,950 --> 03:26:06,570
With every answer I get, I learn about a new mystery.

4378
03:26:06,890 --> 03:26:09,430
Will I be able to break the chain of mysteries before dawn?

4379
03:26:12,050 --> 03:26:13,450
The biggest thing...

4380
03:26:15,110 --> 03:26:16,930
The biggest thing is...

4381
03:26:18,470 --> 03:26:20,010
Still don't know who Cicel is.

4382
03:26:20,270 --> 03:26:23,670
I tried cooking before, and I was way off, I think.

4383
03:26:23,810 --> 03:26:27,190
So I'm... I'm still... I'm still...

4384
03:26:27,190 --> 03:26:29,790
You know, I'm trying not to think too much about it.

4385
03:26:30,330 --> 03:26:31,950
Trying to just see how it plays out.

4386
03:26:34,930 --> 03:26:38,730
Anyway, now that we have the evidence we need, we decided to meet up again at the minister's office.

4387
03:26:39,170 --> 03:26:41,850
Besides, there are a few things I wanted to ask Detective Jowd.

4388
03:26:45,550 --> 03:26:47,490
We are way off to find out who we are?

4389
03:26:53,730 --> 03:26:54,270
We're here!

4390
03:26:54,450 --> 03:26:54,810
Oh my gosh!

4391
03:26:55,170 --> 03:26:57,250
We found the music box, Detective Jowd!

4392
03:26:58,070 --> 03:26:58,830
Good job, Lin.

4393
03:26:59,010 --> 03:26:59,790
I knew you would.

4394
03:27:01,950 --> 03:27:05,270
Once everything has been resolved, I had wanted you to give this to him.

4395
03:27:06,930 --> 03:27:07,370
Him?

4396
03:27:07,470 --> 03:27:09,030
You mean Inspector Cabanela, right?

4397
03:27:09,990 --> 03:27:11,770
I don't suppose he'll ever forgive me.

4398
03:27:12,990 --> 03:27:13,870
Detective Jowd...

4399
03:27:14,750 --> 03:27:16,470
Now then, let's get this thing open.

4400
03:27:16,730 --> 03:27:18,550
There's a certain knack to doing it, you know.

4401
03:27:19,710 --> 03:27:20,150
Okay.

4402
03:27:22,250 --> 03:27:23,830
Oh, you just gotta pull it open.

4403
03:27:24,090 --> 03:27:24,490
See?

4404
03:27:24,950 --> 03:27:25,970
Calls that a knack?

4405
03:27:26,050 --> 03:27:27,930
More like brute strength to me.

4406
03:27:30,190 --> 03:27:30,970
Oh my...

4407
03:27:36,740 --> 03:27:38,020
It's the Hammer Space!

4408
03:27:40,360 --> 03:27:41,580
It's the Hammer Space!

4409
03:27:43,320 --> 03:27:43,800
Real.

4410
03:27:46,160 --> 03:27:49,320
You should find scorch marks on the grip.

4411
03:27:50,360 --> 03:27:51,060
Scorch marks?

4412
03:27:51,620 --> 03:27:54,780
When Camilla built her contraption, she used a special kind of string.

4413
03:27:56,080 --> 03:27:57,560
Yeah, don't look down the barrel!

4414
03:27:57,680 --> 03:27:58,380
What's wrong with you?

4415
03:27:59,000 --> 03:28:00,520
It's a kind of magician's use.

4416
03:28:00,760 --> 03:28:02,320
It burns up in an instant and disappears.

4417
03:28:02,320 --> 03:28:06,020
Why would little Camilla use something like that?

4418
03:28:06,880 --> 03:28:07,600
I don't know.

4419
03:28:07,780 --> 03:28:09,580
Maybe because she's a detective's daughter.

4420
03:28:11,340 --> 03:28:13,560
Not leaving any evidence behind and all that.

4421
03:28:15,240 --> 03:28:18,040
In the case report, there was mentions of some scorch marks.

4422
03:28:20,120 --> 03:28:20,860
On what?

4423
03:28:24,310 --> 03:28:26,030
Oh, on the walls, I'm guessing.

4424
03:28:27,170 --> 03:28:29,830
When it happened, Camilla was watching from her hiding space.

4425
03:28:30,510 --> 03:28:31,510
Revolver Jowd.

4426
03:28:31,610 --> 03:28:32,770
Revolver Jowd?

4427
03:28:32,770 --> 03:28:38,170
She saw the flame run to the gun, something she naturally didn't include in her design.

4428
03:28:44,350 --> 03:28:47,950
I took the gun out of the frame and replaced it with a picture.

4429
03:28:48,370 --> 03:28:52,610
If you remove the picture, you should find scorch marks behind it on the frame too.

4430
03:28:53,210 --> 03:28:55,510
And those marks should match up with the ones on the gun.

4431
03:28:56,470 --> 03:29:01,650
In other words, it proves the contraption existed there in that room that day.

4432
03:29:03,250 --> 03:29:03,730
Hmm...

4433
03:29:05,470 --> 03:29:08,550
And it didn't work the way your little girl intended, is that right?

4434
03:29:09,530 --> 03:29:10,010
Exactly.

4435
03:29:10,090 --> 03:29:12,390
Some cowardly culprit modified the design.

4436
03:29:14,110 --> 03:29:16,650
But that angle was never brought up in court.

4437
03:29:17,150 --> 03:29:21,530
And so as Justice Minister, I must call off the execution at this point.

4438
03:29:22,170 --> 03:29:22,650
Yippee!

4439
03:29:24,790 --> 03:29:26,210
I knew I was right.

4440
03:29:28,650 --> 03:29:30,290
It wasn't Detective Jowd.

4441
03:29:30,350 --> 03:29:31,830
Now we can finally prove that.

4442
03:29:33,950 --> 03:29:34,830
Thank goodness.

4443
03:29:38,850 --> 03:29:39,690
Thank you, Lin.

4444
03:29:40,730 --> 03:29:44,610
In those eyes of yours, I see the eyes of that little girl from ten years ago.

4445
03:29:58,520 --> 03:29:58,960
Cecil...

4446
03:30:00,120 --> 03:30:06,400
If you hadn't come to my cell tonight, I would be gone by now, without ever having known any of this.

4447
03:30:08,080 --> 03:30:09,260
This is what I deserve.

4448
03:30:09,860 --> 03:30:12,080
That's what I told myself these past five years.

4449
03:30:14,700 --> 03:30:15,740
But things are different now.

4450
03:30:16,260 --> 03:30:18,260
Thanks to you, my eyes have finally been opened.

4451
03:30:19,220 --> 03:30:19,660
Tonight.

4452
03:30:20,540 --> 03:30:24,160
I've come into contact with a lot of people's lives and got involved in their fates.

4453
03:30:24,240 --> 03:30:26,320
Yeah, don't I deserve to know who I am now?

4454
03:30:26,760 --> 03:30:29,940
The only reason I was doing that was to regain my own lost memory.

4455
03:30:30,740 --> 03:30:32,080
But things are different now.

4456
03:30:32,640 --> 03:30:34,300
We're connected to each other somehow.

4457
03:30:34,500 --> 03:30:35,320
I just know it.

4458
03:30:37,000 --> 03:30:39,060
That's why I need to ask you a few more questions.

4459
03:30:39,840 --> 03:30:41,740
In order to find the truth about us.

4460
03:30:43,860 --> 03:30:46,180
Yeah, we gotta investigate the real mystery now.

4461
03:30:46,820 --> 03:30:47,500
Fair enough.

4462
03:30:47,760 --> 03:30:48,500
Fire away.

4463
03:30:48,580 --> 03:30:51,800
Sorry, I'm like so invested in this now.

4464
03:30:52,060 --> 03:30:53,460
Let's check out the manipulator.

4465
03:30:55,260 --> 03:30:56,600
Hold on, I'm taking a sippy.

4466
03:30:56,660 --> 03:30:57,740
My throat is getting so dry.

4467
03:31:00,300 --> 03:31:00,740
Okay.

4468
03:31:01,140 --> 03:31:03,900
Yeah, I think I will stop after this just because my throat is like...

4469
03:31:03,900 --> 03:31:05,220
I've been talking so much today.

4470
03:31:07,660 --> 03:31:09,780
Cecil told me all about it, Detective Jowd.

4471
03:31:10,100 --> 03:31:11,280
About the manipulator.

4472
03:31:12,540 --> 03:31:16,180
Yes, and it looks like this manipulator really did a number on the minister too.

4473
03:31:18,620 --> 03:31:19,980
Please don't pick on the minister.

4474
03:31:20,100 --> 03:31:21,980
If he dies again, I'm the one who has to save him.

4475
03:31:25,980 --> 03:31:27,140
Cecil, do you think...

4476
03:31:27,580 --> 03:31:29,280
Do you think that's what happened to me too?

4477
03:31:30,380 --> 03:31:31,400
What are you talking about, Lin?

4478
03:31:31,560 --> 03:31:32,840
Yeah, I think so.

4479
03:31:33,760 --> 03:31:34,700
Don't tell me...

4480
03:31:34,700 --> 03:31:36,320
You were manipulated too?

4481
03:31:40,090 --> 03:31:42,370
There was always a part of me that just couldn't believe it.

4482
03:31:44,450 --> 03:31:46,310
That image of the one who shot me.

4483
03:31:51,030 --> 03:31:53,730
But now I see the possibility of a new explanation.

4484
03:31:57,930 --> 03:31:58,370
But...

4485
03:31:59,450 --> 03:32:00,410
Who is it?

4486
03:32:00,590 --> 03:32:02,030
And why did they do it?

4487
03:32:04,770 --> 03:32:05,650
Camilla's contraption.

4488
03:32:07,270 --> 03:32:10,250
That contraption was a birthday surprise for Camilla's mother, wasn't it?

4489
03:32:10,790 --> 03:32:11,390
That's right.

4490
03:32:12,410 --> 03:32:13,970
Something's been bothering me about it.

4491
03:32:14,590 --> 03:32:17,270
I feel like I know that device from somewhere.

4492
03:32:17,410 --> 03:32:19,170
Oh, she finally realized.

4493
03:32:20,190 --> 03:32:21,370
No surprise there.

4494
03:32:21,670 --> 03:32:25,070
You lost your life once tonight because of that machine.

4495
03:32:25,970 --> 03:32:27,130
Right, I knew it.

4496
03:32:27,170 --> 03:32:28,190
See, Detective Jowd?

4497
03:32:28,830 --> 03:32:30,290
No, I'm afraid I don't see.

4498
03:32:31,510 --> 03:32:36,170
Detective Jowd is a great detective if he walks up to a crime scene and says he did it technically.

4499
03:32:36,230 --> 03:32:36,990
He solved it.

4500
03:32:37,030 --> 03:32:38,010
And he gets the credit.

4501
03:32:42,490 --> 03:32:43,590
That's so true.

4502
03:32:44,030 --> 03:32:46,190
He has a spotless record.

4503
03:32:46,490 --> 03:32:47,430
It was me.

4504
03:32:51,150 --> 03:32:51,750
Flashback.

4505
03:32:51,910 --> 03:32:53,410
I told Detective Jowd about it.

4506
03:32:56,410 --> 03:33:00,550
Told him about seeing the exact same contraption tonight in a completely different place.

4507
03:33:08,130 --> 03:33:09,630
That's very strange indeed.

4508
03:33:11,130 --> 03:33:12,770
I was like thinking for a second.

4509
03:33:12,930 --> 03:33:13,670
I was like, how did...

4510
03:33:13,670 --> 03:33:15,070
Why would she think to know this?

4511
03:33:15,270 --> 03:33:15,990
Like, or rather...

4512
03:33:16,450 --> 03:33:17,350
Why did they do it?

4513
03:33:17,410 --> 03:33:18,390
They were doing a little silly.

4514
03:33:20,130 --> 03:33:22,110
Rather, I was thinking, why does the...

4515
03:33:22,510 --> 03:33:24,850
Why did the scientist guy know about it?

4516
03:33:26,090 --> 03:33:26,450
And...

4517
03:33:27,330 --> 03:33:27,690
I'm...

4518
03:33:28,230 --> 03:33:28,930
You know...

4519
03:33:30,190 --> 03:33:36,710
Part of me is just like, is he a bad guy and told her how to make it and then knew how to manipulate it?

4520
03:33:38,050 --> 03:33:38,410
Um...

4521
03:33:38,410 --> 03:33:40,530
So that it would be...

4522
03:33:41,470 --> 03:33:42,790
It would be...

4523
03:33:43,830 --> 03:33:44,350
Lethal?

4524
03:33:46,810 --> 03:33:47,330
Hmm...

4525
03:33:47,990 --> 03:33:49,870
Yeah, or the scientist was investigating.

4526
03:33:49,990 --> 03:33:51,370
Obviously, like, that's, you know...

4527
03:33:51,990 --> 03:33:53,270
The other half.

4528
03:33:54,070 --> 03:33:54,590
But...

4529
03:33:56,630 --> 03:33:57,150
Hmm...

4530
03:33:57,750 --> 03:33:59,050
That's very strange indeed.

4531
03:34:00,230 --> 03:34:01,990
A junkyard on the edge of town.

4532
03:34:02,170 --> 03:34:03,430
I've never even heard of the place.

4533
03:34:03,970 --> 03:34:07,450
And what's more, I've never told a single soul about that contraption.

4534
03:34:08,330 --> 03:34:09,210
You haven't?

4535
03:34:10,490 --> 03:34:10,930
Hmm...

4536
03:34:10,930 --> 03:34:11,850
That old pigeon guy.

4537
03:34:12,190 --> 03:34:13,450
Who in the world is he?

4538
03:34:13,610 --> 03:34:13,830
Yeah!

4539
03:34:15,830 --> 03:34:16,270
Temsik.

4540
03:34:16,950 --> 03:34:19,230
Detective Jowd, you must have heard this name before.

4541
03:34:19,890 --> 03:34:20,330
Temsik.

4542
03:34:21,150 --> 03:34:23,450
The meteorite that fell in the park ten years ago.

4543
03:34:23,650 --> 03:34:24,430
You were there.

4544
03:34:26,510 --> 03:34:28,490
So you found out about that, did you?

4545
03:34:28,750 --> 03:34:31,790
I heard that meteorite saved little Lin's life.

4546
03:34:31,970 --> 03:34:32,890
And then you took the credit!

4547
03:34:33,830 --> 03:34:34,430
That's right.

4548
03:34:34,750 --> 03:34:36,750
I couldn't do anything to help Lin that day.

4549
03:34:37,570 --> 03:34:39,110
But in that case, I don't get it.

4550
03:34:39,750 --> 03:34:43,310
If it's true, doesn't it mean you didn't steal somebody's life away?

4551
03:34:45,410 --> 03:34:46,470
What are you talking about?

4552
03:34:47,210 --> 03:34:49,190
Detective Jowd, you told me that ten years ago.

4553
03:34:49,810 --> 03:34:53,110
The person who killed the perpetrator in the park was you.

4554
03:34:54,830 --> 03:34:55,230
What?

4555
03:34:55,350 --> 03:34:56,650
But it was the meteorite!

4556
03:34:58,130 --> 03:34:59,110
Yeah, you weirdo.

4557
03:35:01,090 --> 03:35:02,130
I wasn't lying.

4558
03:35:02,970 --> 03:35:06,490
Also, this is totally unrelated, but it's been bothering me for so long.

4559
03:35:06,490 --> 03:35:15,270
Every time I see this portrait of Detective Jowd standing right here with the text blocking him...

4560
03:35:15,270 --> 03:35:17,890
His shirt reminds me of Osomatsu-san.

4561
03:35:18,930 --> 03:35:21,070
It reminds me of... not Karamatsu.

4562
03:35:22,310 --> 03:35:23,490
With the pink one.

4563
03:35:24,070 --> 03:35:26,550
It makes me think of it every time.

4564
03:35:26,830 --> 03:35:28,610
And it distracts me so much!

4565
03:35:29,170 --> 03:35:30,650
What's the pink one's name?

4566
03:35:31,930 --> 03:35:32,530
Ah...

4567
03:35:32,530 --> 03:35:32,710
Ah...

4568
03:35:34,930 --> 03:35:36,370
Gosh, I can't remember.

4569
03:35:37,550 --> 03:35:38,110
Todomatsu!

4570
03:35:41,330 --> 03:35:41,890
Todomatsu!

4571
03:35:41,930 --> 03:35:43,710
I think of him every time.

4572
03:35:43,730 --> 03:35:45,370
Because of the little design.

4573
03:35:46,430 --> 03:35:47,550
On Totty!

4574
03:35:52,380 --> 03:35:53,460
It's so funny.

4575
03:35:54,880 --> 03:35:57,480
If anybody's wondering, I was a Jushi Matsu girl.

4576
03:35:58,860 --> 03:35:59,980
I wasn't lying.

4577
03:36:00,320 --> 03:36:01,920
I stole that man's life away.

4578
03:36:02,100 --> 03:36:03,360
No question about it.

4579
03:36:03,360 --> 03:36:04,820
It was entirely my fault.

4580
03:36:08,860 --> 03:36:10,560
I was just about to shoot him.

4581
03:36:13,540 --> 03:36:17,740
Ichimatsu was the sad guy, wasn't he?

4582
03:36:20,540 --> 03:36:23,820
I would have shot him in the next instant if the meteorite hadn't come.

4583
03:36:25,040 --> 03:36:28,040
At that point, I was already a murderer.

4584
03:36:28,600 --> 03:36:29,160
What?

4585
03:36:29,500 --> 03:36:31,460
That's not how that works.

4586
03:36:32,560 --> 03:36:33,640
That's not true!

4587
03:36:33,920 --> 03:36:35,420
You were trying to save me!

4588
03:36:35,800 --> 03:36:37,300
Lin, I'm sorry, but...

4589
03:36:37,300 --> 03:36:39,080
I don't think that's really it.

4590
03:36:39,660 --> 03:36:40,240
Huh?

4591
03:36:43,230 --> 03:36:45,920
The truth about ten years ago...

4592
03:36:45,920 --> 03:36:46,680
Uh-oh.

4593
03:36:46,800 --> 03:36:50,000
On that day ten years ago, a different incident happened in another place.

4594
03:36:51,000 --> 03:36:51,880
Another place?

4595
03:36:53,040 --> 03:36:55,960
Yes, in the police headquarters interrogation room.

4596
03:36:57,360 --> 03:36:59,180
This guy just can't stop lying!

4597
03:37:01,060 --> 03:37:02,560
The worst sort of incident.

4598
03:37:02,840 --> 03:37:04,700
A suspect who was being questioned escaped.

4599
03:37:05,600 --> 03:37:07,020
Wow, I didn't know about that.

4600
03:37:08,640 --> 03:37:12,040
I happened to be there in the detective division, so I joined the chase.

4601
03:37:12,680 --> 03:37:18,160
Fortunately, or I guess unfortunately, I was able to track him down alone in the park.

4602
03:37:20,120 --> 03:37:21,120
Hold it right there.

4603
03:37:22,940 --> 03:37:24,400
I fired a warning shot.

4604
03:37:24,540 --> 03:37:25,840
I wanted to catch him bad.

4605
03:37:26,580 --> 03:37:28,440
That warning shot made him panic.

4606
03:37:31,860 --> 03:37:37,880
At the time, I was a young and green detective, brandishing my sense of justice like a sword.

4607
03:37:38,720 --> 03:37:41,060
I made him panic and got you involved, Lin.

4608
03:37:41,240 --> 03:37:42,400
It was all my fault.

4609
03:37:46,740 --> 03:37:47,700
Detective Zhao...

4610
03:37:48,600 --> 03:37:50,260
All I could see was my target.

4611
03:37:50,440 --> 03:37:51,520
I couldn't even see you.

4612
03:37:52,340 --> 03:37:53,560
I'm so sorry, Lin.

4613
03:37:54,880 --> 03:38:00,640
So he didn't really have her interest in best... her safety in mind is what he's trying to say.

4614
03:38:02,120 --> 03:38:04,020
My sword is a tool of justice.

4615
03:38:05,980 --> 03:38:08,220
Well, you know what they say about that sword.

4616
03:38:10,500 --> 03:38:12,580
So the man who grabbed me died that day.

4617
03:38:13,540 --> 03:38:16,820
These last ten years, I've never forgotten his face.

4618
03:38:17,380 --> 03:38:26,040
And then a few years after that, when my wife Alma died in such a mysterious way, I thought it was fate my punishment was for what I'd done.

4619
03:38:27,380 --> 03:38:28,740
I mean, that would make sense.

4620
03:38:28,760 --> 03:38:29,800
Why the manipulator?

4621
03:38:30,640 --> 03:38:32,340
He went after Zhao's wife.

4622
03:38:32,720 --> 03:38:34,160
He's just like...

4623
03:38:36,480 --> 03:38:37,240
Revenge, baby!

4624
03:38:38,400 --> 03:38:38,920
Revenge!

4625
03:38:46,290 --> 03:38:48,290
I painted pictures in my cell.

4626
03:38:48,450 --> 03:38:50,190
Nothing but portraits of people's faces.

4627
03:38:52,530 --> 03:38:53,570
Size... 13.

4628
03:38:53,890 --> 03:38:54,550
Welcome to the membership.

4629
03:38:54,670 --> 03:38:54,990
Thank you!

4630
03:38:56,710 --> 03:39:00,530
All the faces of the many people I've met in my life and didn't want to forget.

4631
03:39:01,570 --> 03:39:02,090
All the faces of the many people I've met in my life and didn't want to forget.

4632
03:39:02,710 --> 03:39:03,270
Revengeance.

4633
03:39:05,870 --> 03:39:06,710
And tonight...

4634
03:39:07,970 --> 03:39:09,190
It was our face.

4635
03:39:09,230 --> 03:39:09,750
It was Cecil.

4636
03:39:09,990 --> 03:39:12,050
I finished my last portrait.

4637
03:39:12,250 --> 03:39:14,210
The final face I wanted to remember.

4638
03:39:22,090 --> 03:39:23,210
The final face.

4639
03:39:25,310 --> 03:39:27,590
The face of the man in the park that day.

4640
03:39:27,690 --> 03:39:27,870
Huh?

4641
03:39:32,640 --> 03:39:32,930
What?

4642
03:39:32,930 --> 03:39:34,350
Wait just one minute!

4643
03:39:35,070 --> 03:39:36,050
That can't be!

4644
03:39:36,210 --> 03:39:37,450
I saw that painting!

4645
03:39:38,270 --> 03:39:40,190
I saw the face you painted tonight!

4646
03:39:44,000 --> 03:39:44,290
What?

4647
03:39:46,650 --> 03:39:48,310
It was my face!

4648
03:39:50,470 --> 03:39:53,450
Are you telling me I was the man in the park that time?

4649
03:39:56,700 --> 03:39:57,540
That's right.

4650
03:39:58,120 --> 03:40:01,180
That face of yours is the face I saw 10 years ago.

4651
03:40:04,380 --> 03:40:06,900
The face of the man whose life I stole.

4652
03:40:07,100 --> 03:40:09,660
Of the man who was pronounced dead at the scene.

4653
03:40:10,720 --> 03:40:11,960
B-b-but hold on!

4654
03:40:13,100 --> 03:40:14,140
Detective Jowd...

4655
03:40:17,480 --> 03:40:18,620
That can't be true!

4656
03:40:18,680 --> 03:40:20,260
I just met Cecil for the first time tonight!

4657
03:40:23,680 --> 03:40:26,120
Did someone reverse our fate?

4658
03:40:26,800 --> 03:40:27,320
Somehow!

4659
03:40:28,260 --> 03:40:28,740
Maybe...

4660
03:40:29,700 --> 03:40:37,000
Did he think we were dead but then someone rever- And he died right in front of me!

4661
03:40:38,980 --> 03:40:40,000
By the way...

4662
03:40:40,000 --> 03:40:43,520
The name that I know of the man in the park that day by...

4663
03:40:43,520 --> 03:40:44,780
Isn't Cecil.

4664
03:40:45,560 --> 03:40:46,040
What?

4665
03:40:47,180 --> 03:40:49,820
From the first minute I laid eyes on you tonight...

4666
03:40:50,260 --> 03:40:51,300
I've been wondering...

4667
03:40:51,300 --> 03:40:53,360
Who in the world is this guy?

4668
03:40:55,480 --> 03:40:55,960
I...

4669
03:40:55,960 --> 03:40:56,740
Uh...

4670
03:41:02,810 --> 03:41:03,870
Mr. Minister.

4671
03:41:04,890 --> 03:41:06,550
Inspector Cabanela, where are you?

4672
03:41:06,730 --> 03:41:08,370
Oh, he's at the Pigeon Man.

4673
03:41:09,990 --> 03:41:11,450
Just be quiet and listen.

4674
03:41:11,670 --> 03:41:12,790
This is our demand!

4675
03:41:14,970 --> 03:41:16,730
You double-crosser, you!

4676
03:41:16,850 --> 03:41:17,410
I knew it!

4677
03:41:18,090 --> 03:41:18,570
Demand?

4678
03:41:18,790 --> 03:41:20,170
Our demand hasn't changed.

4679
03:41:20,230 --> 03:41:21,670
The execution must be done.

4680
03:41:21,810 --> 03:41:23,090
Unless he's being manipulated.

4681
03:41:23,950 --> 03:41:26,850
Once we've confirmed it's been carried out, we'll release the hostage.

4682
03:41:28,090 --> 03:41:30,270
What are you talking about, Inspector Cabanela?

4683
03:41:30,770 --> 03:41:33,230
And you know it wasn't my daughter who was abducted.

4684
03:41:34,390 --> 03:41:36,470
Does it really matter who the hostage is?

4685
03:41:36,590 --> 03:41:37,790
A laugh is a laugh.

4686
03:41:38,370 --> 03:41:40,630
Even if it's the daughter of a death row prisoner.

4687
03:41:42,650 --> 03:41:46,130
Once the criminal gets the punishment he deserves, the hostage will go free.

4688
03:41:47,350 --> 03:41:50,270
Carry out the execution immediately and wait for our call.

4689
03:41:55,950 --> 03:41:57,030
What is it, Mr. Minister?

4690
03:41:57,150 --> 03:41:58,370
You look paler than ever.

4691
03:42:01,410 --> 03:42:02,570
I think he's manipulated.

4692
03:42:02,570 --> 03:42:04,210
What in the world?

4693
03:42:04,470 --> 03:42:05,630
What is going on?

4694
03:42:05,870 --> 03:42:07,070
Inspector Cabanela!

4695
03:42:08,110 --> 03:42:09,990
Oh my god, what is going on?

4696
03:42:10,070 --> 03:42:10,810
For real?

4697
03:42:12,070 --> 03:42:18,630
The Rock of the Gods that fell from the sky ten years ago twisted the fates of many people and started a chain of tragic events.

4698
03:42:20,550 --> 03:42:23,330
And even now, the chain continues to grow even longer.

4699
03:42:23,570 --> 03:42:25,830
Inspector Cabanela's call proved that to us.

4700
03:42:28,950 --> 03:42:29,730
What is this?

4701
03:42:29,730 --> 03:42:34,730
And the greatest mystery of all has risen to the surface.

4702
03:42:34,970 --> 03:42:37,470
Who is this me I've been chasing all night?

4703
03:42:38,630 --> 03:42:41,010
The music is so awesome.

4704
03:42:41,330 --> 03:42:43,350
Who am I?

4705
03:42:43,510 --> 03:42:44,110
I'm Minto!

4706
03:42:45,590 --> 03:42:48,290
I'm even further from knowing than when I started.

4707
03:42:53,620 --> 03:42:55,620
Who am I?

4708
03:42:55,620 --> 03:42:55,980
Who am I?

4709
03:42:57,820 --> 03:43:00,360
Wow, it's 2.55 a.m.

4710
03:43:00,360 --> 03:43:01,020
Oh my goodness.

4711
03:43:02,140 --> 03:43:03,560
The linked past.

4712
03:43:04,140 --> 03:43:05,360
Save the data.

4713
03:43:07,540 --> 03:43:08,800
Stop the playing.

4714
03:43:16,540 --> 03:43:17,300
Wow!

4715
03:43:22,080 --> 03:43:22,840
Wow!

4716
03:43:26,280 --> 03:43:28,160
Yeah, I think we'll finish it tomorrow.

4717
03:43:29,560 --> 03:43:30,260
We stopped.

4718
03:43:30,340 --> 03:43:31,380
We have three more.

4719
03:43:32,580 --> 03:43:33,420
16, 17, 18.

4720
03:43:34,420 --> 03:43:35,160
Oh no, wait.

4721
03:43:35,280 --> 03:43:36,640
We left on 14, right?

4722
03:43:36,700 --> 03:43:37,000
Hold on.

4723
03:43:40,560 --> 03:43:41,840
15, 16, 17, 18.

4724
03:43:42,000 --> 03:43:42,240
Wait.

4725
03:43:43,640 --> 03:43:45,480
15, 16, 17, 18.

4726
03:43:45,620 --> 03:43:46,680
Okay, so four.

4727
03:43:46,760 --> 03:43:47,960
One, two, three, four.

4728
03:43:48,120 --> 03:43:48,560
Four more.

4729
03:43:49,240 --> 03:43:49,960
Four more!

4730
03:43:51,120 --> 03:43:51,880
Four more.

4731
03:43:53,720 --> 03:43:54,440
One, two, three, four.

4732
03:43:54,440 --> 03:43:58,860
And that'll be part five, which I think is a good like...

4733
03:44:00,940 --> 03:44:01,660
A good...

4734
03:44:04,040 --> 03:44:04,400
Number.

4735
03:44:05,120 --> 03:44:07,600
You wouldn't have been able to stop if you got any further.

4736
03:44:07,740 --> 03:44:08,540
I don't think so either.

4737
03:44:09,320 --> 03:44:12,580
We haven't seen the blue guy and his henchman from the beginning in a long time.

4738
03:44:12,700 --> 03:44:13,880
Looking forward to seeing how this ends.

4739
03:44:13,920 --> 03:44:14,300
Me too!

4740
03:44:14,660 --> 03:44:15,120
It's been... yeah.

4741
03:44:17,340 --> 03:44:18,560
I've been thinking about them.

4742
03:44:19,120 --> 03:44:20,480
I've been thinking about them.

4743
03:44:25,500 --> 03:44:26,020
Oh...

4744
03:44:30,670 --> 03:44:31,510
Arranged version.

4745
03:44:32,750 --> 03:44:34,730
Because there's originals, right?

4746
03:44:37,590 --> 03:44:38,950
Is this the original version?

4747
03:44:43,410 --> 03:44:44,390
And then...

4748
03:44:45,170 --> 03:44:45,690
Oh.

4749
03:44:45,690 --> 03:44:47,190
Oh, it is quite different, actually.

4750
03:44:50,750 --> 03:44:52,170
You're going to like the next level?

4751
03:44:52,310 --> 03:44:54,210
I'm... HO is the best one in the game.

4752
03:44:54,310 --> 03:44:55,070
I'm excited.

4753
03:44:55,290 --> 03:44:55,750
I'm excited.

4754
03:44:57,910 --> 03:44:58,430
Okay.

4755
03:44:58,430 --> 03:45:01,870
So tomorrow, same time, same place.

4756
03:45:02,070 --> 03:45:03,050
We'll finish it up.

4757
03:45:03,750 --> 03:45:06,050
We'll get through the next four chapters.

4758
03:45:06,250 --> 03:45:08,530
We made a really good, great progress, though.

4759
03:45:08,930 --> 03:45:12,310
We went through one, two... We went through four chapters today, so...

4760
03:45:13,650 --> 03:45:14,610
Good job, everybody.

4761
03:45:14,770 --> 03:45:15,190
Good job.

4762
03:45:17,410 --> 03:45:19,670
I have a job interview on Friday.

4763
03:45:19,790 --> 03:45:20,590
I need luck.

4764
03:45:20,850 --> 03:45:23,010
Or I suppose a manipulator would help.

4765
03:45:23,350 --> 03:45:24,790
No, no, no.

4766
03:45:25,190 --> 03:45:28,410
If you got me in there, Mia, I'd be like...

4767
03:45:28,410 --> 03:45:30,410
I'd be like...

4768
03:45:30,970 --> 03:45:31,170
Oh.

4769
03:45:31,930 --> 03:45:32,450
Oh.

4770
03:45:34,210 --> 03:45:34,730
Oh.

4771
03:45:41,010 --> 03:45:42,050
The stream...

4772
03:45:44,890 --> 03:45:46,870
The OBS... something, something.

4773
03:45:49,750 --> 03:45:51,090
OBS stopped for a second.

4774
03:45:51,310 --> 03:45:52,010
YouTube died.

4775
03:45:52,130 --> 03:45:52,750
No, it was OBS.

4776
03:45:53,070 --> 03:45:53,330
Okay.

4777
03:45:54,470 --> 03:45:55,510
That means...

4778
03:45:57,010 --> 03:45:59,090
That means it's time for me to...

4779
03:45:59,670 --> 03:46:00,390
Quit it.

4780
03:46:01,890 --> 03:46:04,590
That means it's time for me to quit, I believe.

4781
03:46:06,770 --> 03:46:07,610
Well, guys...

4782
03:46:09,670 --> 03:46:10,310
Hold on.

4783
03:46:10,370 --> 03:46:13,890
I'm trying to bring up my chat again because YouTube was being kind of silly.

4784
03:46:14,950 --> 03:46:17,490
It always gets delayed after a certain amount of time.

4785
03:46:17,730 --> 03:46:18,070
Uh-oh.

4786
03:46:18,130 --> 03:46:18,410
Wait.

4787
03:46:18,490 --> 03:46:19,410
YouTube is dead for me.

4788
03:46:19,530 --> 03:46:19,970
Oh, boy.

4789
03:46:20,930 --> 03:46:23,630
Oh, boy.

4790
03:46:27,030 --> 03:46:27,870
Oh, boy.

4791
03:46:28,150 --> 03:46:28,570
YouTube...

4792
03:46:30,370 --> 03:46:30,790
YouTube...

4793
03:46:33,410 --> 03:46:34,130
YouTube live.

4794
03:46:35,710 --> 03:46:36,370
Here we go.

4795
03:46:36,450 --> 03:46:36,630
Okay.

4796
03:46:40,880 --> 03:46:41,240
Okay.

4797
03:46:41,260 --> 03:46:41,700
Here we go.

4798
03:46:43,260 --> 03:46:43,620
Alright.

4799
03:46:44,360 --> 03:46:45,340
See you tomorrow, Minto.

4800
03:46:45,660 --> 03:46:47,440
Thank you, Alaric.

4801
03:46:47,500 --> 03:46:48,100
Thank you.

4802
03:46:48,880 --> 03:46:49,780
Thank you for the stream.

4803
03:46:49,920 --> 03:46:51,620
Thank you guys so much for joining me again today.

4804
03:46:51,880 --> 03:46:55,000
Tomorrow, we'll wrap up the mystery and... yeah.

4805
03:46:55,420 --> 03:46:56,020
I'm gonna go.

4806
03:46:56,220 --> 03:46:59,380
I'm actually... I was gonna talk for a bit but I think I'm gonna go because...

4807
03:46:59,380 --> 03:47:01,380
My throat is quite sore.

4808
03:47:01,700 --> 03:47:02,920
I'm gonna go take some of my...

4809
03:47:02,920 --> 03:47:03,360
Wait.

4810
03:47:03,460 --> 03:47:04,320
I think I'm out of my medicine.

4811
03:47:04,580 --> 03:47:05,760
I forgot to order more!

4812
03:47:07,780 --> 03:47:08,520
I'll get some more.

4813
03:47:08,620 --> 03:47:10,680
I'm at least gonna get some water so that I can...

4814
03:47:11,180 --> 03:47:11,580
Yeah.

4815
03:47:11,840 --> 03:47:12,240
But...

4816
03:47:14,740 --> 03:47:16,120
Saw something cool today on Twitter.

4817
03:47:16,300 --> 03:47:17,680
Umamusume Pretty Derby collab with...

4818
03:47:19,920 --> 03:47:20,320
Wait.

4819
03:47:20,320 --> 03:47:20,720
What?

4820
03:47:22,100 --> 03:47:25,040
There's a Top Gun collab with Umamusume?

4821
03:47:25,040 --> 03:47:25,140
Am I?

4822
03:47:42,750 --> 03:47:43,850
How did I miss this?

4823
03:47:43,910 --> 03:47:45,070
This is from like last week.

4824
03:47:47,230 --> 03:47:48,110
Oh my god.

4825
03:47:48,750 --> 03:47:49,830
How did I miss this?

4826
03:47:50,490 --> 03:47:51,330
Oh my god.

4827
03:47:55,490 --> 03:47:56,550
That's so awesome.

4828
03:47:57,630 --> 03:47:58,510
Oh my god.

4829
03:47:58,830 --> 03:47:59,590
Oh my god.

4830
03:47:59,810 --> 03:48:00,330
Oh my god.

4831
03:48:00,750 --> 03:48:02,130
Brain rot is activated.

4832
03:48:04,890 --> 03:48:06,290
You were gone for a bit.

4833
03:48:06,390 --> 03:48:06,950
I guess so.

4834
03:48:07,570 --> 03:48:09,250
Oh my god.

4835
03:48:13,950 --> 03:48:14,970
Oh my god.

4836
03:48:18,030 --> 03:48:18,630
Yo.

4837
03:48:18,750 --> 03:48:19,810
That's so crazy.

4838
03:48:22,190 --> 03:48:23,290
No way.

4839
03:48:23,570 --> 03:48:24,670
Oh my gosh.

4840
03:48:24,710 --> 03:48:25,870
Top Gun Maverick.

4841
03:48:25,870 --> 03:48:26,530
My beloved.

4842
03:48:30,690 --> 03:48:31,290
Wait.

4843
03:48:31,290 --> 03:48:32,910
It's two years and a week ago.

4844
03:48:35,910 --> 03:48:36,750
Oh my god.

4845
03:48:36,770 --> 03:48:37,070
You're right.

4846
03:48:37,130 --> 03:48:37,590
It says 2022.

4847
03:48:42,310 --> 03:48:43,990
Why did nobody ever tell me?

4848
03:48:45,670 --> 03:48:48,950
This page is probably gonna wonder why I retweeted their thing.

4849
03:48:52,770 --> 03:48:55,490
I guess it would make sense when the movie came out.

4850
03:48:55,590 --> 03:48:55,870
Right?

4851
03:48:56,350 --> 03:48:57,750
Because it wouldn't make sense.

4852
03:48:59,310 --> 03:49:03,070
It wouldn't make sense if it was now.

4853
03:49:03,230 --> 03:49:04,090
I was like...

4854
03:49:04,890 --> 03:49:12,410
It wouldn't make sense if it's like... I was like... Why is Top Gun doing a thing now?

4855
03:49:13,470 --> 03:49:13,830
Right?

4856
03:49:14,670 --> 03:49:16,150
The movie is a little old now.

4857
03:49:16,390 --> 03:49:17,930
It's still new in my heart.

4858
03:49:19,070 --> 03:49:20,950
I think that's why I didn't even question it.

4859
03:49:21,030 --> 03:49:22,910
I was like... I just watched it yesterday.

4860
03:49:30,590 --> 03:49:30,950
Alrighty.

4861
03:49:30,950 --> 03:49:31,310
Anyway.

4862
03:49:31,730 --> 03:49:32,910
Thank you guys again.

4863
03:49:33,070 --> 03:49:33,590
I'm gonna go.

4864
03:49:33,710 --> 03:49:34,310
I'm gonna go sleep.

4865
03:49:34,590 --> 03:49:34,870
Or...

4866
03:49:35,570 --> 03:49:35,930
Yeah.

4867
03:49:35,930 --> 03:49:37,670
I've got some stuff I need to do and then I'll sleep.

4868
03:49:37,830 --> 03:49:39,490
And then I'll make the waiting room for the finale.

4869
03:49:39,890 --> 03:49:42,570
And we will finish off Ghost Trick tomorrow.

4870
03:49:43,290 --> 03:49:43,650
And...

4871
03:49:45,230 --> 03:49:45,930
What's tomorrow?

4872
03:49:46,070 --> 03:49:46,310
Wednesday?

4873
03:49:46,570 --> 03:49:49,530
I will try and have a schedule out for this week.

4874
03:49:49,610 --> 03:49:51,130
It probably... I mean it's already late.

4875
03:49:51,230 --> 03:49:51,750
I'm really sorry.

4876
03:49:51,990 --> 03:49:52,670
I'm so late.

4877
03:49:52,730 --> 03:49:53,070
Sorry.

4878
03:49:53,270 --> 03:49:53,830
It's okay.

4879
03:49:54,730 --> 03:49:55,390
It's okay.

4880
03:49:58,190 --> 03:49:59,390
Devs please rerun.

4881
03:50:01,270 --> 03:50:01,750
Yeah.

4882
03:50:03,830 --> 03:50:05,150
Sorry for the late schedule.

4883
03:50:05,450 --> 03:50:06,950
It's just my brain was...

4884
03:50:06,950 --> 03:50:11,630
But I do have a collab this... this week I believe.

4885
03:50:14,490 --> 03:50:16,250
I believe I have a collab...

4886
03:50:17,910 --> 03:50:18,870
Going on...

4887
03:50:19,490 --> 03:50:20,690
Later on Thursday.

4888
03:50:21,810 --> 03:50:22,290
So...

4889
03:50:23,450 --> 03:50:24,890
You can look forward to that.

4890
03:50:25,210 --> 03:50:25,690
Maybe.

4891
03:50:27,850 --> 03:50:30,050
If you can't make a schedule this week, it's totally okay.

4892
03:50:30,310 --> 03:50:31,350
But I still need to.

4893
03:50:32,150 --> 03:50:34,230
I wanna... Because I still have Friday.

4894
03:50:35,190 --> 03:50:36,710
Saturday I have the truck event.

4895
03:50:36,770 --> 03:50:38,150
So I won't be streaming.

4896
03:50:38,770 --> 03:50:40,070
And then Sunday as well.

4897
03:50:40,270 --> 03:50:42,430
I'll need to make for Sunday.

4898
03:50:43,950 --> 03:50:44,470
Okay.

4899
03:50:45,330 --> 03:50:46,970
With Maus and Henya it leaked?

4900
03:50:50,810 --> 03:50:52,070
Who said it?

4901
03:50:52,270 --> 03:50:55,570
Who leaked?

4902
03:50:55,730 --> 03:50:56,570
Which one of them?

4903
03:50:58,550 --> 03:51:00,130
Which one of them leaked it?

4904
03:51:04,670 --> 03:51:05,670
Maus said it.

4905
03:51:07,590 --> 03:51:08,110
Okay.

4906
03:51:08,390 --> 03:51:08,970
But yeah.

4907
03:51:09,070 --> 03:51:12,390
Maus and Henya will be showing me around the Vishoujo Minecraft server.

4908
03:51:12,990 --> 03:51:13,510
So...

4909
03:51:14,610 --> 03:51:17,050
I was... I haven't gone into it yet.

4910
03:51:17,910 --> 03:51:22,490
I've been very nervous to go in because I'm scared of all the mods that they have and stuff.

4911
03:51:23,250 --> 03:51:23,890
But yeah.

4912
03:51:24,550 --> 03:51:26,030
Thank you for the raid.

4913
03:51:26,050 --> 03:51:27,270
I can't read it.

4914
03:51:28,790 --> 03:51:29,310
Savi.

4915
03:51:29,430 --> 03:51:30,370
Thank you Savi.

4916
