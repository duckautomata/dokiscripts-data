00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,840
What was that?

3
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,280

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:50,820

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,510
I didn't know you were in here.

11
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,430
Hold on a second.

12
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,090
Oh, welcome to Minecraft!

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,230
I won't be able to let you out later, probably.

25
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,050
Stop looking at me.

26
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,810

I think I'll just let her out.

36
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,150
Sorry, I didn't realize she was in here.

37
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:39,950

Happy birthday to you.

46
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,080
Happy birthday to you.

47
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,700
Happy birthday to you.

48
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,640
Dear Railarm.

49
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,700
Happy birthday to you.

50
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,280

00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,000
An 8-bit romance.

55
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,080
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

56
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,940
Why is everybody gifting?

57
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,020
What was going on?

58
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,520
Okay, I have to figure out how to turn this down.

59
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,240
Maybe just the master volume.

60
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,440
But, oh, that's much better.

61
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,320
Weird logarithm, thanks for the tango tip.

62
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,240
Let me turn it up just a little bit more.

63
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,640
Like 75?

64
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,440
Okay, this is better.

65
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,460
For Fox's sake.

66
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,520
Thank you both.

67
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,700
Thank you for the five.

68
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,480
Thank you for the ten.

69
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,680
Spang!

70
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,300
Thank you for the ten.

71
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,160
Um, what was I saying?

72
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,940
Oh, I have to tell Henya that I'm ready, I think.

73
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,160
I'm not ready, though.

74
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,860
Oh gosh, you guys, I'm so nervous.

75
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,160
Is she already on?

76
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,340
Oh, oh, Henya dao.

77
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,600

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,700
You guys!

79
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,980
Oh my gosh.

80
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,540
This is my first time ever playing in the V-show.

81
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,480
Minecraft server.

82
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:57,360
If you're unaware, they kind of recently, somewhat recently
opened it up to other indie VTubers.

83
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,400
And so I asked if I could join and check it out.

84
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,780
But there's all sorts of balls.

85
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,520
Balls.

86
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,600
There's all sorts of mods that I don't know.

87
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,280
I don't know at all what they're like.

88
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:28,320

Why am I on a building?

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,270
Where am I?

94
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,380
Why am I up here?

95
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,160
Um, your PC is dead.

96
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,550

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,690

Thank you!

100
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,170
Wow!

101
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,570
Oh wow!

102
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,230
Wait, this is Crouch.

103
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,710
Wait, why is seat?

104
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,710
Pink concrete brick stairs.

105
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,430
Wait, oh, I'm laying down!

106
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:35,190
What?

107
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,470
There's like a lay down button.

108
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,010
Hello.

109
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,370
Dial.

110
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,310
Oh, thanks for the five-gifted.

111
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,230
Bye, Roblox.

112
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,050
Thank you for the 10 gifts.

113
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,290
I wonder if she is if she's conscious.

114
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,610
I wonder if she doesn't know that I'm on.

115
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,090
Wait, what is all this stuff that I have?

116
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:57,450
Whoa!

117
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,310
One of 97?

118
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,850
What is this?

119
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,530
I have an uncommon hat grab.

120
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,430
Wait, no, hat grab bag.

121
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,950
I have an info guide.

122
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,730
I have a hamburger.

123
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:10,910
Oh, yeah.

124
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,330
I have a candle holder.

125
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,450
Iron staff of building.

126
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,450
A decorative gift.

127
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,570
A warped mailbox.

128
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,610
And a style magazine.

129
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,270
Um...

130
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,590
What are those arrows to...

131
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,690
So curious.

132
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,090
Yay, join us, Dayo!

133
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,290
I'm in... I'm ready!

134
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,070
Hanya!

135
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,350
I'm in Minecraft.

136
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,010
Oh!

137
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,500
I'm on top of a building.

138
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,640
Hanya, help me!

139
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,840
Why is there another Hanya over there?

140
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,740
She found one of the pictures.

141
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,760
What do the pictures do?

142
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,320
Oh wait, this says V.

143
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,460
Shoujo cat ears.

144
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,300
Can I wear it?

145
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,780
On my hat?

146
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:04,760
No.

147
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,620
It's just a magazine of...

148
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,300
Wait, right click to unlock cosmetic.

149
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,540
Oh.

150
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,700
Hello!

151
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,300
Oh, someone else joined.

152
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,240
Someone else joined.

153
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,900
I did try right clicking it.

154
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,560
This is me right clicking it.

155
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,080
I'm on a building.

156
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,140
I think there's in-game voice chat, but just in case...

157
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,980
Actually, I'm not quite sure.

158
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,720
What is that?

159
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,440
Oh my god, there's a creature down there.

160
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,420
Okay, it's actually maybe better that I'm up here because it
might kill me.

161
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,810
Oh, and my hand!

162
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:05,700
Hello?

163
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
They disappeared.

164
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:25,340
Wait.

165
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:33,670
Is that Henya?

166
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:34,870
Minto?

167
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,530
Henya!

168
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,830
Can you hear me?

169
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:39,570
She's not in

170
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,600
here.

171
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,340
Minto?

172
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,720
Henya!

173
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,040
What is...

174
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,980
I'm right here!

175
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,520
Wait, how do I...

176
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,120
Oh, there she is!

177
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,560
Hello!

178
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,760
You don't know about the voice chat.

179
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,320
Hold on.

180
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,600
Oh, I'm on push to talk.

181
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Hello?

182
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,840
Oh, hello!

183
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,100
Wait, I hear your voice from your side, though.

184
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:17,460
Oh, wait.

185
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,020
I think I have to change my microphone.

186
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,540
Okay, that should be good.

187
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,740
Nice!

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,220
I don't know what place is this, but it's something.

260
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,060
What is that sound?

261

265
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,250
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, my God.

266
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,330
You can grab people.

267
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,570
You can, she's got, oh, my God, she's got me on a leash.

268
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,470
Oh, my God.

269
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:46,330
You press shift and then right click and you can hold
people, but it has to be empty hand.

270
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,810
Shift, right click.

271
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,170
It's not working.

272
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:53,750
Oh, really?

273
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,750
Do you have anything on your hand?

274
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,910
No.

275
00:17:59,470 --> 00:17:59,970
Hmm.

276
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:00,590
No.

277
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,070
Oh, she meant sneak.

278
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,490
Oh.

279
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,170
Oh, my sneak's not working though.

280
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,090
I don't know why.

281
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:06,550
Oh.

282
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,010
Let me try this.

283
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,090
Oh, yeah.

284
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,990
It has my sneak and touch.

285
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,170
Oh.

286
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,290
I like that.

287
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,030
Why is my sneak not working?

288
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,630
Oh.

289
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,110
I think the original key should be a shift.

290
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,190
Yeah, but I changed it.

291
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,070
It's okay.

292
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,510
Oh, you changed it.

293
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,610
Yeah, you can try it later.

294
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,010
Yeah.

295
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,750
Wow, that was so much fun.

296
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:40,230
Also, we have a thing that is called Waystone, so if you
touch it, you can keep it here anytime you want.

297
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,910
Oh, Henya Land.

298
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,010
Yeah, make sure you touch it every time when you see these.

299
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,530
I'm gonna always be here.

300
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,130
Henya Land.

301
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,930
Why are you licking, Naya?

302
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,690
Because it's actually delicious.

303
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:01,350
It's Yeah, but it says Henya land on it.

304
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, of course.

305
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,970
I'm gonna do a summoning circle here.

306
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,290
Oh, Henya, Henya, Henya.

307
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,190
Oh no, oh no.

308
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,810
What did I just get into?

309
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,110
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

310
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,310
It's all good.

311
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,710
Please don't bother these a lot of signs.

312
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,250
Zen faced it.

313
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,850
Ready for a fun...

314
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:31,270
Oh.

315
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,530
Well, actually, you can't get inside because Ari gave me
this magnificent sign.

316
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,830
We can get in from here, I guess.

317
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,350
Okay.

318
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,230
Oh, whoa!

319
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:45,980
Whoa.

320
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,000
Here it goes.

321
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,640
Ta-da-da!

322
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,500
Whoa!

323
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,680
Welcome in!

324
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,620
Oh, what was that?

325
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,200
Ew.

326
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:54,660
Oh.

327
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,260
That's my pet.

328
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,580
What's my pet sound?

329
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,180
My pet is right here, right here.

330
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,660
Right here!

331
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,740
My friend Dio and Jeff.

332
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:12,920
Oh!

333
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,500
Dio and Jeff.

334
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,520
Yeah, Dio and Jeff.

335
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,520
Dio and Jeff.

336
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,740
Get inside.

337
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,640
Oh, jump, jump.

338
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,360
Skill issue, Dio.

339
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,560
I'm getting good.

340
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:37,830
What are they?

341
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,430
They are...

342
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,050
Oh, Mouse is here.

343
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:43,990
Mousey!

344
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,530
It's okay.

345
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,510
Day

346
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,780
nine.

347
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,780
Day nine.

348
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:04,480
When you have a pickaxe and when you get close to them,
they're going to get scared because they saw they were going

349
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,380
to mind them.

350
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,440
Oh, I do it.

351
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,280
No!

352
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,280
I don't want to kill!

353
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,300
Um, I can use...

354
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,160
I have nothing to...

355
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,400
Oh, I have...

356
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:18,800
This.

357
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,780
Stay back.

358
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,940
Oh, that's for building.

359
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,940
That's for building.

360
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:23,500
Oh.

361
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,540
Yeah, that's Olympic.

362
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,120
I can give you one, ladies.

363
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:28,920
Okay.

364
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,900
And here's my...

365
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,860

366
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,900
So many signs.

367
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:33,720
I know.

368
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,720
Thanks to Zed.

369
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:36,980
Oh.

370
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,220
Whoa.

371

00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,530
Oh, there's a ladder over here too.

556
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,850
to go to a Sith boy.

557
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:30,310
Oh.

558
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,430
Here we go.

559
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,470
Oh,

560
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,100
there are still...

561
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,580
Oh, my God.

562
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,520
Oh, cute!

563
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,700
Gengar!

564
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,580
Gengar!

565
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,580
That's my boy right there.

566
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,280
Gengar.

567
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Me too, Mousy.

568
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,900
Yeah, I love Gengar too.

569
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,040
I'll play a game with only Gengar.

570
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,340
Sometimes.

571
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:08,880
Really?

572
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,120
Yeah, we all Pokemon with just Gengar.

573
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,660
Gengar dao.

574
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,300
Oh, Gengar dao.

575
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,780
Gengar.

576
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,520
So yeah, this is an art gallery we have.

577
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
It's so beautiful.

578
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,080
Down there, we have a post office too.

579
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,280
Would you like to look at it?

580
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,000
Oh yeah.

581
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,840
Let's go.

582
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:32,520
Okay.

583
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,080
Let's go.

584
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,640
Where is the stairs again?

585
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,540
Uh, this way?

586
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,660
This way, this way.

587
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,500
There's so many buildings now.

588
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,780
There's so many buildings.

589
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,300
It's so active in here.

590
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,120
It is.

591
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,900
There's so many people in the server as well.

592
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,720
That's so awesome.

593
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,880
Yeah, it is!

594
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,120
Oh, here.

595
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,580
I'm gonna get lost.

596
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,100
It's so huge.

597
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,120
Pop-pada-pada-pada-pada.

598
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:15,070
Here's the, here's the post office that we have.

599
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,830
Also, mouse filled this one too.

600
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,430
Ooh, I like these doors.

601
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:22,770
Fancy.

602
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,150
Ooh, fancy.

603
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:31,490
I think you can use this place to send them a gift and
letter to people.

604
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:32,490
Wait, real?

605
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,330
I do have a mailbox.

606
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:41,130
So once you place the mailbox, you put the stuff in here.

607
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,250
They will deliver it to your mailbox automatically.

608
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,450
Yeah, click right here.

609
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,350
Click this one.

610
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:48,890
Right click.

611
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:49,990
Oh!

612
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,150
Whoa!

613
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:56,710
Okay.

614
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,770
I'm gonna start sending creepy letters to everybody.

615
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,690
Yeah, it's so fun.

616
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,910
It's so fun.

617
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,910
It's so cool.

618
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:07,930
This is so cool.

619
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,950
It's so cool.

620
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:12,650
Oh my god.

621
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:13,810
Ah!

622
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,190
There's here, O'Brien.

623
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:17,790
Hair, Brian!

624
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,010
What the heck?

625
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,430
I think he works here.

626
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,630
I think so.

627
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:23,690
Didn't know.

628
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:26,130
Didn't know Mousy got the new employee.

629
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,350
It's a hair, O'Brien.

630
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,990
Hey, do your job, O'Brien.

631
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,530
He helps out a lot.

632
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:32,990
Oh, good.

633
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:34,230
Maybe.

634
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,530
Keep doing your job.

635
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,190
Maybe he'll get a raise one day, O'Brien.

636
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:47,880
Cars.

637
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,380
The garage is so funny.

638
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,940
Yeah, we have a garage door.

639
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,720
And also...

640
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,360
Oh, this is a portal for Nezer.

641
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,300
So if you go in here, you go to the Nezer.

642
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,020
Are we going?

643
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,700
Uh, we can if you want.

644
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,580
Here we go.

645
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,420
Oh.

646
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:11,900
Except me.

647
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,120
Somehow bound to S-Control or something instead.

648
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,540
They're trying to buy it.

649
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,840
It's just regular control.

650
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,180
Whoa!

651
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,220
Even the nether is, like, so different too.

652
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,940
Yeah, I was gonna say it's so different.

653
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,220
It's a lot different.

654
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,000
You'll love it.

655
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,460
We even said that it, like, introduced itself.

656
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,260
The nether.

657
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,040
Oh, look over there.

658
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,740
Blue Forest Palace.

659
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,120
Whoa!

660
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:47,820
Whoa!

661
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:48,760
Oh!

662
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,520
Oh!

663
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:49,640
Oh!

664
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,570
It's so blue.

665
00:34:59,110 --> 00:34:59,510
Oh my god.

666
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,650
It's so beautiful.

667
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,570
It is, it is!

668
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:05,870
Wow.

669
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:14,190
They have a lot of cool stuff too, so I hope you enjoy it.

670
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,680
Oh, the lights!

671
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,860
Wait, who's that?

672
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,080
There's an old man walking around.

673
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,780
Old man?

674
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,280
Yeah, I think so.

675
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,220
What?

676
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:30,940
Ah!

677
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,140
Oh.

678
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,080
The traveling merchant.

679
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,040
Oh, he's just in here?

680
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:39,700
Oh!

681
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,620
He's chilling in here.

682
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,660
Wait, he's here?

683
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,760
Is it a nether?

684
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,660
Oh my.

685
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,320
You're gonna die, mister.

686
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,960
Why the heck he's in here?

687
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,260
You're gonna die in here.

688
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,940
On point, Nito villager.

689
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,400
Nito villager.

690
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,160
Yeah.

691
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,200
Nito villager, what are you doing in here?

692
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,960
It's actually unemployed.

693
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,440
Why even here?

694
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,000
Ah!

695
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,820
Oh, what just happened?

696
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,140
What?

697
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,140
What's that sound?

698
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,700
Oh, that's a hook shot.

699
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,800
Oh, I thought I was gonna- I thought I was about to die.

700
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:24,460
What was that?

701
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,860
Oh, the village looks really different too from the vanilla
Minecraft.

702
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,900
It's a lot bigger.

703
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,380
Wait, so there's different biomes and stuff too?

704
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,520
Would you like to see it?

705
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:37,900
Yeah!

706
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,000
Okay, oh, uh, when you...

707
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:48,240
When you type slash spawn, you can go back to the spawn area
anytime.

708
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,320
Oh, okay.

709
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,620
Slash spawn.

710
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:51,760
That's it?

711
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,840
Yeah, and send.

712
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:55,920
Oh!

713
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,580
Oh, that's crazy.

714
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:02,860
See?

715
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,460
It's so good.

716
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,200
No, I did not see the pink house.

717
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,480
This is so cursed.

718
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,240
The pink house?

719
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,660
Wait, that looks so cute though.

720
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,120
Oh, pink house.

721
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,060
Okay, hold on.

722
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,320
Skelly, should I...

723
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:27,440
Mint!

724
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:28,420
Mint!

725
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:29,620
Hello?

726
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:30,800
Mint!

727
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,040
Hello?

728
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:32,480
Mint!

729
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,620
Hit you!

730
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,930
Oh, it's so good to see you!

731
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,110
Mint, mouse!

732
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,410
I'm being led.

733
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:45,530
I don't know what's going on.

734
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,790
Mint, welcome to the server.

735
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,750
I got these for you.

736
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:50,610
Me?

737
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,230
And I made you spaghetti.

738
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,290
Spaghetti?

739
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,950
You can make spaghetti?

740
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,470
Wait, how do I get it?

741
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,510
Grab this- Oh!

742
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:02,730
Oh!

743
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:02,930
Oh!

744
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:03,070

Thank you!

748
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:12,950
Oh my gosh!

749
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,210
I'm gonna eat it.

750
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:15,810
Oh!

751
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,110
You're putting your mouth!

752
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,390
I- I- I- I got an achievement.

753
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:21,610
Whoa!

754
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,030

758
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,870

00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,780
Oh, thank you.

760
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,440
You're so welcome.

761
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,000
Has she seen the museum?

762
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,200
Yeah, we just did.

763
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,160
She just got here.

764
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,220
So far, we saw...

765
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:45,880
Oh, my gosh.

766
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,980
The museum is the best part.

767
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,580
Yeah, you have to see the swap.

768
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,720
Oh, the swap?

769
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,200

770
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

771
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,420
Uh, hold on.

772
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,280
I live in this...

773
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:58,940
You can get out from here.

774
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,040
This way, this way.

775
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,800
Oh, okay.

776
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,180
There we go.

777
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:03,440
Okay.

778
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,820
Here we go.

779
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,600
Let's go swamp.

780
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,420
Let's go swamp.

781
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:09,660
Swamp.

782
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,700
Oh my god.

783
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,080
Isn't it all content?

784
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,300
Oh yeah.

785
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,780
Matta gave it to me.

786
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,980
You can feed him fish or honey.

787
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,340
I have honey.

788
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,220
Yeah, if you throw a honeycomb at him, he holds it in his
hand and he eats it.

789
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,400
It's so cute.

790
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,740
It's so sticky cute.

791
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,900
I think the pandas, I think they do that too.

792
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,860
Yeah, yeah, that's so cute.

793
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:35,520
That's true.

794
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,680
Oh, oh.

795
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,300
Light as a frog.

796
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,160
What did I, what did I become?

797
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,660
Oh, touch the waste.

798
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:53,420
If you're ever missing any resources, you just go into that
spooky little temple back there, and you can just take

799
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,260
whatever's in there.

800
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,640
That one over there?

801
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:56,840
Yeah.

802
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,760
I made the house and the temple.

803
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,820
Can I go see the temple?

804
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,380
Yeah, whatever you need anything, you can just go inside
there and you can just take it.

805
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:05,720
It's free.

806
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,160
You can just take it.

807
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,520
Am I gonna die?

808
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,300
No, no, no, no.

809
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,820
You're just going to make a deal.

810
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,920
Make a deal?

811
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,220
Oh, that's easy.

812
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:15,960
Yeah.

813
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:19,910
Oh.

814
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:22,850
Whoa.

815
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,110
In here, in here.

816
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:30,850
Touch the computer.

817
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:32,290
Oh.

818
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:35,210
Whoa!

819
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:36,270
Whoa!

820
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,910
Whoa, there's so much stuff in here!

821
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:40,870
You should make one too.

822
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,390
You don't need to make a warehouse.

823
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,810
It's all the stuff I've collected.

824
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,130
What the hell?

825
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:48,550
Oh my god!

826
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:49,830
There's so much here!

827
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,450
There's a bunch of chests down here.

828
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:57,730
And when you connect it with these terminals, like you just
need to put the random stuff in the chest.

829
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,090
Or you can put it in from here.

830
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:03,110
And they'll do like all the organizing and everything by
their self.

831
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,250
So you don't need to deal with it.

832
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,930
Wait, my crouch isn't working!

833
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,250
Um, hold on, let me try changing it again.

834
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,310
I don't know why my key bind directing funny.

835
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,070
Wait, I didn't know you could actually go inside of the
storage.

836
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,430
Yeah, you can!

837
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,790
Wait, how- I want to see how many chests you have.

838
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,110
I want to see how nuts it is.

839
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,030
It's from here, it's here, it's here.

840
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,790
You see the, like, a pipeline?

841
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:27,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

842
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,290
You go down there.

843
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,670
Wait, let me see your chests.

844
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:32,790

It's setting to add S.

848
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:42,890
I don't know why.

849
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:44,510
Froggy!

850
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:47,510
Huh?

851
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,960

852
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,740
Can you do this?

853
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,000
C?

854
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:01,360
C.

855
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:05,740

856
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,300
Oh, I can do the C.

857
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,760
Did you change it?

00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,790
Shaking my head, Zen.

1116
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:29,590
Sentreya from V-Shojo, shaking my head.

1117
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:33,370
Um...

1118
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:36,230
I'll just set it to 500 minutes.

1119
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:38,150
Oh, nice, nice.

1120
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:41,130
Make it to 1000, 1000 minutes.

1121
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:42,910
Yeah, 1000 minutes.

1122
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:44,710
Oh, I almost fell out.

1123
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:46,970
Ouch.

1124
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:49,830
Are you okay?

1125
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,170
Yep, I'm okay.

1126
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:52,850
Are you okay?

1127
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,380
Don't worry about it.

1128
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,240
Don't worry about it.

1129
00:53:59,280 --> 00:53:59,420
Yeah.

1130
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:00,060
Yeah.

1131
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:00,820
Yeah.

1132
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:01,120
Yeah.

1133
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:01,460
Yeah.

1134
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,920
What is this?

1135
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,380
Oh, it's a cat!

1136
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:05,780
Why does it sound like that?

1137
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,140
Yeah, it's a cat though.

1138
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,700
Oh, that's a lipid.

1139
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,040
That's a lipid as well.

1140
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:11,740
Oh.

1141
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,060
When you go up here.

1142
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,440
Oh, there's more.

1143
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,980
I think this is her bedroom, I guess.

1144
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:19,640
Mm-hmm.

1145
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,480
There's a... Wait, there's a Herobrine again.

1146
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,420
What's a maid here, O'Brien?

1147
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:30,520
Wait a minute, I thought he's at a post office.

1148
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,880
He's in tier two?

1149
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,320
Maybe she's renting this to him.

1150
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,380
Maybe, maybe.

1151
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,180
This is a limpet.

1152
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,240
This is a limpet.

1153
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,060
It's...

1154
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:51,080
It's like Gary from SpongeBob.

1155
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,920
Oh, wait, that's true.

1156
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:55,500
Meow.

1157
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,000
Meow.

1158
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:02,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1159
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,240
Zen.

1160
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,720
Do you think these will fit me?

1161
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:17,370
Do you think these will fit me?

1162
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:19,390
Oh, my God, the center of her hole!

1163
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:20,030
Ah!

1164
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:24,070
Oh, my God, so cute!

1165
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:24,910
Oh, my gosh.

00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:25,770
No way.

1167
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:27,550
Yeah, it looks so cute.

1168
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:29,130
Look.

1169
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:31,090
I'm looking.

1170
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:34,610
Ta-ta-da-da.

1171
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:36,910
Is there like a little buddy?

1172
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,370

He's my god.

1179
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,370
I pray to your god.

1180
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:56,310
Dun dun dun.

1181
00:55:58,270 --> 00:55:59,510
It's so adorable.

1182
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:00,590

Well they have everything.

1298
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:57,380
Apples.

1299
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:58,960
We got everything in here.

1300
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,620
And we got the cash register over here.

1301
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:03,340
I'm just gonna steal.

1302
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:05,740
Yeah, steal there.

1303
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,840
She's not gonna notice.

1304
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:08,100
Yeah, she's not gonna notice.

1305
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,080
Yeah.

1306
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,920
Let's rob this place.

1307
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,480
This place is so tall.

1308
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,820
I can't see anything.

1309
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:17,720
Me neither.

1310
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,360
This place is so tall.

1311
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,060
We need a small people market.

1312
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:22,980
Yeah!

1313
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,640
Everything is so tall now!

1314
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:30,560
But that means maybe we get bigger size and so...

1315
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,500
It lasts longer for us.

1316
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,400
Because we're so small.

1317
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:37,420
This is the best one.

1318
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,740
So that's a Zen house.

1319
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:41,730
Uh...

1320
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:42,900
Uh...

1321
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,210
I'm okay.

1322
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:49,390
Obviously.

1323
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,600
I'm okay.

1324
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,740
No problem.

1325
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:57,660
No problem.

1326
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,880
No problem.

1327
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:02,860
No problem.

1328
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:06,080
We should make her a mermaid.

1329
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:06,740
We should make her a mermaid.

1330
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:07,280
Yeah, we should.

1331
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,400
How do I make it again?

1332
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:10,160
Mermaid.

1333
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:14,920
It's cool.

1334
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,880
She can make it.

1335
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:19,800
Oh my god.

1336
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,440
She's a genius.

1337
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,400
Oh, so are you.

1338
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,480
Maybe...

1339
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,980
Mouse is more of a genius.

1340
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,040
Wait, what do you mean?

1341
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,620
I am the genius, though.

1342
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:34,520
Yeah, but she's making...

1343
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,740
She made the mermaid!

1344
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:37,120
Oh.

1345
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,100
Thank you!

1346
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,660
Wait, I just wear this?

1347
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:43,160
Mm-hmm.

1348
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:45,560
And then I become a mermaid?

1349
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:49,540
There you go.

1350
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,160
You're a mermaid now.

1351
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,200
Oh, I am.

1352
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:53,440
Oh, my God.

1353
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:54,820
Oh, look at my tail.

1354
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,140
Yeah, look at you.

1355
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,480
You can change a color, too.

1356
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,680
Yeah, you'll never drown.

1357
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,180
And you're so fast, though.

1358
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,060
Yeah.

1359
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:08,200
Oh, my God.

1360
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:11,640
You guys, I'm a mermaid.

1361
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,240
Oh, my God.

1362
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:14,660
I want to be where the people are.

1363
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1364
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:20,300
Under the sea!

1365
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,600
Thank you, Mousy!

1366
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:27,460
Thank you!

1367
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:31,680
Wow!

1368
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:34,800
Modern Minecraft does everything.

1369
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:39,380
And this one right here is Melody's house.

1370
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:39,920
Oh!

1371
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,560
Oh my god, the cinnamon roll.

1372
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,060
Yeah, Melody built it.

1373
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,100
Melody built it.

1374
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,500
What is this brick?

1375
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:53,860
It's a white concrete and a white metal book.

1376
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:58,120
It's high-end, packed, silto.

1377
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:00,340
Silto.

1378
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:02,580
So cute!

1379
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:04,480
Yeah!

1380
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,000
It is, it is!

1381
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:07,920
Oh my gosh, so pretty!

1382
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:08,560
Oh my gosh.

1383
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,080
All the houses look so nice.

1384
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,820
I love the windows!

1385
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,280
F5.

1386
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:15,480
For what?

1387
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:21,460
Now home!

1388
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:22,040
Cute!

1389
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:23,660
What's this?

1390
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:27,320
Oh, Silver and Bill, what is this?

1391
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:28,440
Oh, cute.

1392
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:40,410
There's a cat, everybody- Oh, the cats sleeping are so cute!

1393
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:41,470
Oh my god, wait.

1394
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:43,150
I know, it's so cute!

1395
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,810
I'm inside Mel's bed.

1396
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:46,890
I don't know, this might be kind of yabai.

1397
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:50,910
It's okay, she doesn't know, she doesn't know.

1398
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:51,930
I don't know.

1399
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:53,170
Oh.

1400
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:55,570
We are in.

1401
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:57,350
We are in.

1402
01:04:57,710 --> 01:04:57,930
We are in.

1403
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:58,870
We are in.

1404
01:04:59,470 --> 01:04:59,670
We are in.

1405
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:01,950
How's the smell?

1406
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:02,570
It smells.

1407
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:09,090
Hmm.

1408
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:12,010
Also she has a pet as well.

1409
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:13,470
She has a pet as well.

1410
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:13,910
Huh?

1411
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:15,470
Yeah.

1412
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,150
Come to come to the backyard.

1413
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:18,250
Backyard?

1414
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:19,590
Yeah.

1415
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:22,010
Oh, in here?

1416
01:05:22,070 --> 01:05:22,470
Look!

1417
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:23,990
Oh, in here!

1418
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:32,450
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

1419
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:34,130
Is he gonna eat me?

1420
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,450
Oh, bad, bad, bad dragon.

1421
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:39,410
Can I ride?

1422
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:41,110
I think he's not hungry today.

1423
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:42,870
Oh, can I ride on his back?

1424
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:44,810
Yeah, you can try.

1425
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:47,930
Come on.

1426
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:48,470
Out!

1427
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:50,330
Come on.

1428
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:50,610
Wait!

1429
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:51,630
Come here.

1430
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:52,090
Oh.

1431
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:56,580
Oh.

1432
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:02,860
Oh.

1433
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:03,980
Oh.

1434
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,140
What's happening?

1435
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,000
Oh.

1436
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:08,860
Oh.

1437
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:08,960
Oh.

1438
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:09,440
He's a scary.

1439
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:11,140
He's a bad dragon.

1440
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:11,860
He's scary.

1441
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:13,160
Yeah, he's bad.

1442
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:15,120
You're mean bad dragon.

1443
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:16,320
Bad dragon.

1444
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,320
Bad dragon.

1445
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:19,760
Bad dragon.

1446
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,300
I want to make a hat out of him.

1447
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:24,240
Where are these melodies playing?

1448
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,200
I will kill him.

1449
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:28,800
It's okay.

1450
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,460
Oh, I can probably...

1451
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,180
Wait, I don't want to hit him either just in case.

1452
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,980
I don't know what his health is like.

1453
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:36,640
He's so cool, though.

1454
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:37,980
I want to...

1455
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:38,320
I want to...

1456
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:38,800
I want him.

1457
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,980
Maybe I can push him in the back, or...

1458
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:45,620
Oh, okay.

1459
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:46,400
Oh, there you go.

1460
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:46,780
There you go.

1461
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:47,800
Sasuka, I'm out of here.

1462
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:51,560
So, yeah.

1463
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,560
This is a Melody's place.

1464
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:54,960
I think she's building it.

1465
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,760
a new one somewhere.

1466
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:58,480
It's so cute.

1467
01:06:58,580 --> 01:06:58,920
Oh my god.

1468
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,680
The trees even.

1469
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:02,720
Wow.

1470
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:05,300
Oh yeah, it's here, isn't it?

1471
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:06,640
Wow, it's going to be.

1472
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:07,260
Magnolia.

1473
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:13,000
It's so pretty.

1474
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,280
A lot of pretty trees.

1475
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,100
Yeah.

1476
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,100
We have so many trees and it's so pretty.

1477
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,960
So that's a Mousy's place.

1478
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:39,450
cool and uh next one here we go so the next one oh this is a
Camilla's house as well with my amazing art that I have yes

cover his entire place with a watermelon.

1481
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:05,770
Ah!

1482
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:06,870
Paybacker!

1483
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:08,150
Yeah, paybacker!

1484
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:10,070
I think it looks so much better like this.

1485
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:11,850
Yeah!

1486
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:12,810
I like it too!

1487
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:13,710
I like it too!

1488
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:14,230
Yeah!

1489
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:16,850
I like the art of him getting attacked.

1490
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:19,610
He's building a train for this area.

1491
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:20,630
And Giga-chan-henya!

1492
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:22,990
Yeah, Giga-chan-henya!

1493
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:23,650
Exactly.

1494
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:30,070
Oh my gosh, If I steal from Henya, what will you create?

1495
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:32,630
Oh, you'll see it.

1496
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:34,190
You'll see it though.

1497
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:35,830
Oh wow.

1498
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:41,330
Oh, he really likes these spinning things.

1499
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:44,950
Yeah, there are so many things in here.

1500
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:45,470
Yeah.

1501
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,650
Wait, he made a train!

1502
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:50,430
I wanna get on!

1503
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:51,750
Wait, it's actually...

1504
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:52,530
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1505
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:54,110
He's making a train run!

1506
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:57,090
Oh my gosh, it's a hell burn again.

1507
01:08:57,730 --> 01:08:58,830
Oh, oh!

1508
01:08:59,430 --> 01:08:59,750
Oh!

1509
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:02,090
It's so fast!

1510
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:03,890
It is!

1511
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:07,270
Why are there so many endermens here?

1512
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:11,390
Oh, I hear a spider too.

1513
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:13,110
Is this dangerous?

1514
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:17,430
Wait!

1515
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:18,610
That's so cool!

1516
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:19,530
He's making it true!

1517
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:22,620
One shot kill.

1518
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:23,640
I will protect.

1519
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:24,740
Okay, Mousy!

1520
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,540
I leave it to you!

1521
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:28,300
Oh, and I... Oh!

1522
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,680
Are you okay?

1523
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:39,800
No, don't get hit by train!

1524
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,820
How do we get on the train though?

1525
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:45,600
It's so fast.

1526
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,140
It is.

1527
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:49,320
I tried it but I couldn't though.

1528
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,620
Okay, I'm gonna run at it.

1529
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,300
What the heck?

1530
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,580
So close.

1531
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,880
But yeah, he has a lot of stuff over here.

1532
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,120
There's even a hair around here.

1533
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:09,200
I think you can use it.

1534
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:09,960
Over here?

1535
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,460
He has a lot of cool stuff.

1536
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:18,980
I don't really know how to use it because I'm not really
know about Creed and Mod, but he got a lot of cool things

1537
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:19,500
over here.

1538
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:21,380
Yeah, live, laugh, love.

1539
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:30,350
Oh my gosh, it's really working in there.

1540
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:31,270
What was that?

1541
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,610
I feel like I'm playing a new game.

1542
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:38,730
Yeah, this is completely different.

1543
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:41,170
I think you all love it because this is so cool.

1544
01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:42,090
Yeah.

1545
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:48,130
It's a lot of cool things over here.

1546
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:48,910
Oh, that's what?

1547
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:50,130
I don't know.

1548
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:50,690
The water.

1549
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:51,550
Yeah.

1550
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:54,090
So it's okay if you go in.

1551
01:10:55,170 --> 01:10:55,470
What?

1552
01:10:57,050 --> 01:10:58,010
What just happened?

1553
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:06,940
I was trying to push you in.

1554
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:08,240
And then I thought something exploded.

1555
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:09,540
Here we go.

1556
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:11,340
Oh, that's her hammer.

1557
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:11,880
Oh.

1558
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,300
Want to try it?

1559
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:16,400
The hammer?

1560
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:16,900

Yeah, I have them here for your materials.

1611
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:09,300
It's not going to like stay looking like this, but I thought
it would also be pretty to like grow some of these and then

1612
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:12,800
get rid of the leaves and swap them out with some of these
blue and purple ones.

1613
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,800
Oh, they'll be good.

1614
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:17,020
Wait, this one is like blue color.

1615
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,360

So I'm gonna like swap them out.

1618
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:21,900
So I'm using it for material.

1619
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:23,920
Mouse.

1620
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:24,260

Oh.

1623
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:28,140
Mouse.

1624
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:29,600
Oh.

1625
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:33,240
She's on the hunt.

1626
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:34,060
Oh, there's a thing.

1627
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,480
I've done nothing wrong.

1628
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:38,040
It is so cute though.

1629
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,920
Oh, thank you.

1630
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:40,900
Yeah.

1631
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:42,600
I'm intruding.

1632
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,040
I don't have any furniture in it just yet.

1633
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,980
Because I'm working on a basement right now.

1634
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:46,940
But.

1635
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,160
Oh, you basement.

1636
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:49,120
You're a house?

1637
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:50,380
Alright, come on, Mouse.

1638
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,220
Let's go for a while.

1639
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:52,200
This is here.

1640
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:54,680
Excuse me.

1641
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:55,500
Hey, where'd you go?

1642
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:56,480
I'm inside.

1643
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,040
Oh, you're inside?

1644
01:14:58,720 --> 01:14:59,760
Oh, you're inside.

1645
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:00,420
Hello.

1646
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:03,220
Sorry.

1647
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:04,120
There's a mouse!

1648
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:06,060
Oh, do it for her.

1649
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:07,100
The shrine.

1650
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,320
You gotta do it for Mouse.

1651
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:12,800
I own Ari's soul.

1652
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:13,820
It's true.

1653
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,460
I need this boat for Athenia.

1654
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,100
Oh yeah, that would be really cute.

1655
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:19,740
Really?

1656
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:20,640
Yeah.

1657
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,640
I'm gonna make yours too, then I can put it on my house.

1658
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:25,940
Really?

1659
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:27,460
Yeah!

1660
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,400
We can do it together.

1661
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:30,980
Oh my god.

1662
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:44,520
Yeah, I don't have any furniture in here just yet.

1663
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,540
Your house is so cute.

1664
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:47,800
Yeah, it's peanut.

1665
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:52,760
I love it.

Oh my god, so cute!

I love it.

1734
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:17,200
It looks like it's actually here.

1735
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:18,300
It does, it does.

1736
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,360
Who added, who added the soup?

1737
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:22,320
Oh my god, that's so cute!

1738
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:25,500
It is cute, kawaii.

1739
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,920
Look at how short they all are.

1740
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,100
It's not a music disc, does anybody need this?

1741
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,100
Are you wearing a Sonic hat?

1742
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:33,340
Yeah!

1743
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:34,820
It makes me sparkle!

1744
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:36,580
It makes me sparkle!

1745
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:38,360
It sounds like it's cute!

1746
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,520
That's why you're sparkling, that's so cool.

1747
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:42,580
It's so cute!

1748
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,320
It's so cute!

1749
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,280
Yeah, Mosh gave it to me.

1750
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,000
Oh.

1751
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,160
Wait, you're wearing a Pikmin hat.

1752
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:55,820
I just realized that you've been wearing a Pikmin hat this
whole time.

1753
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,540
No, it's a Puchiko!

1754
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:58,700
Puchiko from...

1755
01:19:58,700 --> 01:19:59,100
What?

1756
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,480
Puchiko!

1757
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:03,060
But it's got the flower on the head.

1758
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:08,980
No, Pikumi has like a long tailed, like a pointy thing in
it.

1759
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:09,600
What do I do with him?

1760
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:10,480
Oh, you're right, you're right!

1761
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:12,200
I thought it was the yellow pigment.

1762
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:13,740
Oh, he's hot!

1763
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:18,540
Also, how do you have cinema roll like flying around you
now?

1764
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,020
Yeah, what?

1765
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:23,020
How did you do that?

1766
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:25,120
Why did all these cinema rolls come from?

1767
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:27,860
Wait, I'm- Oh my god, I'm snowing!

1768
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:28,520

Oh, wait, that's adorable!

1770
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:34,820
You got a little snowman on your head!

1771
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:36,200
Snow high, Sean!

1772
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,480
That's so cute!

1773
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,220
Oh my god.

1774
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:42,700
There's snowflakes around you.

1775
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:43,020
Yeah.

1776
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,440
That is so, so cute.

1777
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:45,000
That's cute.

1778
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:45,700
That's cute.

1779
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,320
Oh my gosh, you have so much stuff.

1780
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,040
How do you get the hats?

1781
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:52,440
You have to find them, I think.

1782
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:52,900
Oh.

1783
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,100
Yeah, you have to find them.

1784
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:56,480
There's a lot of places that you can go.

1785
01:20:56,620 --> 01:21:01,540
There's a cave and there's a treasure chest inside there so
you can get it from there.

1786
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,200
Excuse me!

1787
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:06,580
Excuse me!

1788
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:07,220
Ari!

1789
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:09,700
Okay.

1790
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:14,200
I'll come to you.

1791
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:15,800
I'll make a pact.

1792
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,100
I'll sell my soul.

1793
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:20,800
I only have, I am a soul.

1794
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,060
I wouldn't say that, Mitt.

1795
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,980
Only one favorite part.

1796
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:27,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1797
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:29,020
I'll make a deal.

1798
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:30,340
I'll make a deal.

1799
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:35,300
Wonderful.

1800
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:37,900
Wonderful.

1801
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,260
Yeah.

1802
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:42,260
It's okay, I'm already dead.

1803
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:43,160
It's okay.

1804
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:46,180
You can't say no.

1805
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:47,340
Don't worry.

1806
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:48,220
Okay, yeah.

1807
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,820
Yeah, yeah, years from now.

1808
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:51,740
Don't, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1809
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,180
No worries, no worries.

1810
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:54,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1811
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,320
What could go wrong?

1812
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:58,580
Nothing.

1813
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:00,740
I trust, yeah.

1814
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:02,720
4K faith.

1815
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:03,780
Yeah, that's not an exaggeration.

1816
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,140
It's true, it's true.

1817
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:09,780
I have quite the debt.

1818
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:13,580
Hey, oh my my, you own a lot, Ari.

1819
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:17,620
Yeah, the amount of gold blocks that I asked Miss for is a
lot.

1820
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:19,140
Oh, that's true, that's true.

1821
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:21,440
You own a lot, Dio.

1822
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:23,380
Yeah, she made my beacon for me.

1823
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,180
I didn't even make it.

1824
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:25,580
She made it herself.

1825
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,980
The block underneath it, too, right?

1826
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:29,860
This was like a mouse made it, right?

1827
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:30,380
Yeah.

1828
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:31,840
She did it all with that.

1829
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:32,820
Yeah.

1830
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,500
Yeah, she got the nether star and everything.

1831
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:37,780
She killed the wither for me.

1832
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,440
Yeah, Mouse kind of owns me.

1833
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:48,880
I remember I spawned the wither thinking that I could kill
it And then I started killing me So I was said to come save

1834
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:54,100
me and kill it Wait, how do you sit down again?

1835
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:57,400
Oh, you look at the ground and you double tap shift

1836
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:06,300
Brains I ain't got one I need one Hanya

1837
01:23:28,230 --> 01:23:29,010
I don't know how she did.

1838
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:31,990
She was like spamming sit, so I guess she just...

1839
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:34,930
Oh my God, Anya.

1840
01:23:35,330 --> 01:23:39,030
Oh, if I give you this, rest in peace.

1853
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:12,530
You look at the ground and you double tap shift.

01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,630
Oh, wait, my thing doesn't...

My crouch is broken.

1858
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:22,810
You end up going to the ground like Kenya.

1859
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:24,310
Uh-oh.

1860
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:26,370
Wait, why did I go up in the ground?

01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:26,890

1862
01:24:26,970 --> 01:24:28,210

healing on him.

1970
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:05,300
But yeah, Froggy's place is this way.

1971

This way.

1972
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:07,160

01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:09,200
Mushroom.

I was waiting till you came back around.

1976
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:16,460
I expanded this corner of the grass a little bit.

1977
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:17,220
Hell yeah.

1978
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:19,560
It didn't really disturb your bridge.

1979
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,520
I just had to relocate some lily pads.

1980
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:25,260
I don't mind if you touch my lily pads if you don't have
faith.

1981
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:26,380
Oh, cute.

1982
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:28,540

Fireflies.

1989
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:38,460
I have a lot of them.

1990
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:39,160
You're a breeder.

He's in the plant.

2011
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:21,150
Let me try and get him.

2012
01:30:21,190 --> 01:30:21,890

2020
01:30:30,730 --> 01:30:31,930
This one.

2021
01:30:32,110 --> 01:30:33,130
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2022
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:33,730
This way, this way.

2023
01:30:33,950 --> 01:30:34,810
Oh, this one.

Thank you.

2025
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:38,210
I can't get him out of the plants.

2026
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:39,310
I can't pick him up.

2027
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:41,010
This is Froggy's place.

2028
01:30:41,630 --> 01:30:42,150
Smells like a frog.

2029
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:44,150
Try so hard.

2030
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:45,890
I can't get him.

2031
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:46,550
I give up.

2032
01:30:46,690 --> 01:30:46,970

01:30:48,190 --> 01:30:48,490
Froggy.

2035
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:50,270
If you pick the plant up, you can get him out.

2036
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:53,230
If I pick the plant up, I was thinking of picking up the
box.

2037
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:55,850
What a crazy setup.

2038
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:56,990
Is this dynamite?

2039
01:30:58,130 --> 01:30:58,530

And you just ran in.

2091
01:32:52,930 --> 01:32:54,090
No hesitation.

2092
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:55,810

01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:19,170
Okay, uh, Mint, so the problem is that the actual teleport
thing is one block up.

2101
01:33:19,410 --> 01:33:21,750
Since you're one block tall, you need to jump into it.

2102
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:22,270
Okay.

2103
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:24,470

Oh my god.

2159
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:40,080
The prisons are full of treasure, but they're also full of
enemies.

2160
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:41,600
You gotta be careful.

2161

01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:08,040
destroy your portal and redo it to get a different prison Oh
That's smart That's smart Joel gave me the portal and I was

how did you get that?

2169
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:13,540

That's it for Ari.

2175
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:24,660
We're never seeing her ever again.

2176
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:25,560

01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:31,600
Ain't nothing you can do about that.

2182
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:33,100
Ain't nothing you can do about that.

2183
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:33,580
She's gone.

2184
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:34,240

Don't do it!

2195
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:55,100
Don't do it with Thunderbrand!

2196
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:56,280
It's so cool!

2197
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:00,560
These kind of photo is everywhere you see it at the
outfield.

2198
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:04,460
So when you find it, you can go inside and get the loot.

2199
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:07,620

So they're all random?

2201
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:14,020
Yeah, I will say there's like a boss in each prison.

2202
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:21,160
I wouldn't attack the boss because when you attack it it
closes it off for everybody else oh okay okay go in the

2203

01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:28,320
Oh my goodness.

2225
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:29,200
Hello, Raiders.

2226
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:29,760
Welcome.

2227
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:35,480
We're playing Minecraft with Mint, Addy, Froggy, and Hanya,
and Neverbloody.

2228
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:38,080
This is my first time Mint joining the server.

2229
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:39,040
It's first time.

2230
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:40,400
I hope you enjoy it.

2231
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:42,040
Yeah, first time.

2232
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:43,220
Her first time.

2233
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:44,080
My first time.

2234
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,600
Oh my gosh, it's so exciting.

2235
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:47,900
Everything's new.

2236
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:49,300
Just like me.

2237
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:50,260
Look at this guy.

2238
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:51,500
Can I take him home?

2239
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:54,720
Oh, you can.

2240
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:57,860
You can destroy him with a pickaxe.

2241
01:38:58,020 --> 01:38:59,320
I think it has to be a...

2242
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:00,440
Is she talking about a corpse?

2243
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:01,040
Nope.

2244
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:01,980
Maybe.

2245
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:02,540
Yeah.

2246
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:04,720
Can I take this home?

2247
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:06,620
You can.

2248
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:07,900
You can take him home.

2249
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:10,360
Hold on.

2250
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:11,320
There you go.

2251
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:11,720
Oh, there you go.

2252
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:12,180
I think you know...

2253
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:13,360
Oh, my God, I have him.

2254
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:17,320
Why is one of the first things you want on the server a
corpse?

2255
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:18,560
A tiny little skeleton.

2256
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:22,420
Spooky scary skeleton.

2257
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:24,320
Stivers up for spawn.

2258
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:29,600
I like stealing these torches a lot of the time too.

2259
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:30,420
Oh, they're really neat.

2260
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:31,300
I like them.

2261
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:32,580
Yeah, they're good torches.

2262
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:33,200
Yeah.

2263
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:37,760
Wow, I want to keep just exploring all the...

2264
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,320
But this place is dangerous, right?

2265
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:43,500
It is, but if you're with somebody that has a good weapon,
it's not too bad.

2266
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:44,180
Yeah.

2267
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:47,700
Yeah, unless you get the good weapon, it's not scary
anymore.

2268
01:39:47,740 --> 01:39:48,100
Yeah.

2269
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:58,500

2284
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:34,480

Oh, so hold the backpack.

2343
01:42:48,330 --> 01:42:53,450
You click it and you should be able to see that there's an
icon that says like...

2344
01:42:53,450 --> 01:42:56,090
It tells you to wear it.

2345
01:42:56,650 --> 01:42:56,650
Oh!

2346
01:42:57,930 --> 01:42:59,510
Wait, how do I wear it?

2347
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:05,670
Oh, I have to hold it in my hand.

2348
01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:06,550
The people stand.

2349
01:43:06,730 --> 01:43:08,790
Yeah, you have to hold it in your hand.

2350
01:43:09,490 --> 01:43:13,530

2354
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:24,130

2355
01:43:24,370 --> 01:43:25,450

01:43:58,110 --> 01:43:58,190
Yeah.

2381
01:43:58,350 --> 01:43:59,430
Oh, it's still weird?

2382
01:43:59,570 --> 01:43:59,950
Yeah.

2383
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:00,730
It's okay though.

2384
01:44:01,690 --> 01:44:02,210
Okay.

2385
01:44:02,330 --> 01:44:03,090
Okay, okay.

2386
01:44:03,510 --> 01:44:05,730
Yeah, but it's so good, it's so good.

2387
01:44:05,950 --> 01:44:07,850
I want to find more treasure, Hanya.

2388
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:10,950
Let's go find more treasure.

2389
01:44:12,190 --> 01:44:13,470
Oh, have you go up here?

2390
01:44:14,310 --> 01:44:14,670
Where?

2391
01:44:16,210 --> 01:44:18,050
Up here, you see this chain?

2392
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:18,910
Oh!

2393
01:44:20,190 --> 01:44:20,590
Oh!

2394
01:44:21,870 --> 01:44:22,430
Uh-oh.

2395
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:29,620
Uh-oh.

2396
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:30,760
What's up?

2397
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,300
I thought I saw something.

2398
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:35,260
No!

2399
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:36,360
No!

2400
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:39,080
What's my achievement?

2401
01:44:40,060 --> 01:44:41,580
Oh, I collected loot.

2402
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:48,720
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

2403
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:51,800
Take it all.

2404
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:54,040
Guts.

2405
01:44:55,820 --> 01:44:58,720
I like when they drop their body parts.

2406
01:45:04,750 --> 01:45:06,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2407
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:10,230
Cool.

2408
01:45:11,530 --> 01:45:13,030
Oh, my health.

2409
01:45:13,230 --> 01:45:13,830
You're right.

2410
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:16,810
My health?

2411
01:45:17,470 --> 01:45:19,170
My health is bad.

2412
01:45:20,010 --> 01:45:21,190
Oh, your health?

2413
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:22,190
Oh, do you need food?

2414
01:45:22,530 --> 01:45:23,910
Oh, I can't eat honeycomb.

2415
01:45:25,290 --> 01:45:26,890
Can I eat guts?

2416
01:45:28,530 --> 01:45:29,610
You can!

2417
01:45:30,810 --> 01:45:32,170
I'm eating them!

2418
01:45:32,850 --> 01:45:34,050
Yummy guts!

2419
01:45:35,170 --> 01:45:36,530
Yummy guts da yo!

2420
01:45:36,990 --> 01:45:37,750
Guts da yo!

2421
01:45:38,690 --> 01:45:39,590
Guts, oi!

2422
01:45:41,550 --> 01:45:42,650
Niku, niku.

2423
01:45:43,630 --> 01:45:43,730
Maybe.

2424
01:45:43,850 --> 01:45:44,570
Oh, there they are!

2425
01:45:45,190 --> 01:45:45,770
Hello?

2426
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:46,610
Hello?

2427
01:45:47,790 --> 01:45:48,330
Hi!

2428
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:49,450
I'm eating really fast.

2429
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:55,080
Killed by

2430
01:46:05,570 --> 01:46:06,850
a leaping zombie!

2431
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,040
Um...

2432
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:15,940
What's in here?

2433
01:46:17,220 --> 01:46:17,800
Nothing.

2434
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:18,800
Oh, there's a...

2435
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:18,960
Oh.

2436
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:20,480
Why is it open like that?

2437
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:23,480
So many of these things.

2438
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:23,960
Oh!

2439
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:24,620
Music.

2440
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:25,260
Oh!

2441
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:25,860
Accept.

2442
01:46:27,740 --> 01:46:28,940
I'm back!

2443
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:31,580
Welcome back!

2444
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:31,980
Welcome back!

2445
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:33,840
It's okay.

2446
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:35,900
It happens, you know.

2447
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:37,860
It happens, it happens.

2448
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:39,500
Yeah, no problem.

2449
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:40,480
The problem, do you?

Oopsie, poopsie.

More loot.

2457
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:04,280
I like how the enemies didn't spawn until you guys came back
over.

2458
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:07,860
They were just chilling, eating food, and then you came

Nice!

2469
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:22,400
This one goes to deeper.

2470
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:23,560
Deeper.

2471
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:25,780
There's more floors.

2472
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:28,140
Oh, I like the tapestry.

2473
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:29,160
Oh, Froggy wasn't lying.

2474
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:32,940
There is, there is.

2475
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:34,180
She doesn't need to know that.

2476
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:34,920
Sure.

2477
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:36,600
I told you I wasn't lying!

2478
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:39,380
I told you!

2479
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:41,260
Oh, she's here!

2480
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:43,460
Yeah!

2481
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:45,900
I haven't explored yet, but there's...

2482
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:46,640
It keeps going.

2483
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:47,180
Oh!

2484
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:50,960
No!

2485
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:52,160
Froggy, no!

2486
01:48:52,580 --> 01:48:53,320
That was impressive.

2487
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:54,780
That was fast.

2488
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:57,060
That was, yeah, that was...

2489
01:48:57,060 --> 01:48:58,140
That was pretty quick.

2490
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:01,440
I don't think Froggy suffered, you know.

2491
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:02,880
It's good.

2492
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,260
It's a quick death.

2493
01:49:06,340 --> 01:49:07,580
Also, I can make you a hook shot.

2494
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:07,920
Hold on.

2495
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:11,860
It's really handy when you don't have a Laytra.

2496
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:13,320
Oh yeah.

2497
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:14,960
I saw about giving you a Laytra.

2498
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:16,580
If you want, I can give it to you.

2499
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:19,220
But also I don't want to take away your experience too.

2500
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:21,160
So let me know if you want.

2501
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:21,980
Oh no, it's okay.

2502
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:22,340
I'll go.

2503
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:23,480
I'll get one myself.

2504
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:25,260
Okay, okay, okay.

2505
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:26,560
Yeah, thank you though.

2506
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:28,000
Of course!

2507
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:28,760
Adi?

2508
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:29,720
Adi?

2509
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:33,980
Sorry!

2510
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:34,780
Sorry!

2511
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:36,220
Too bad!

2512
01:49:36,380 --> 01:49:37,180
Too bad!

2513
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:39,240
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2514
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:41,480
Hangya!

2515
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:45,160
If you swing on me, you swing on Mint!

2516
01:49:46,620 --> 01:49:47,680
Here you go, get her!

2517
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:48,480
Get her hangya!

2518
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:49,180
Get her hangya!

2519
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:53,400
Sacrifice me!

2520
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:57,540
Yeah!

2521
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:58,180
Yeah!

2522
01:49:58,800 --> 01:49:58,940
Yeah!

2523
01:49:58,940 --> 01:49:59,380
Woohoo!

2524
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:04,920
Wait, hold on, I'm gonna make you a hook shot.

2525
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:05,340
Hold on.

2526
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:05,620
Okay!

2527
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:07,580
I'm trying to change my key bind still.

2528
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:09,840
Key stone, key stone.

2529
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:11,640
Hi!

2530
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:14,560
You know, maybe I deserve that.

2531
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:17,220
How's the taste of defeated, da yo?

2532
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,140
Back in Pandora.

2533
01:50:19,740 --> 01:50:20,020
Yeah.

2534
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:23,060
Don't you give me that sassy?

2535
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:25,560
Yeah!

2536
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:27,000
Yeah!

2537
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:27,640
What is it?

2538
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:28,900
I didn't care what?

2539
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:30,020
Wait.

2540
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:32,780
You're too sassy.

2541
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:33,920
You're too sassy, Hanya.

2542
01:50:34,460 --> 01:50:35,660
It's sassy baka, da yo.

2543
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:40,360
There we go.

2544
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:42,960
I'm trying to give her to...

2545
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:43,400
Oh!

2546
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:44,600
Okay, I need arrow.

2547
01:50:48,570 --> 01:50:50,170
There we go.

2548
01:50:50,450 --> 01:50:51,570
Did you see that?

2549
01:50:56,430 --> 01:50:58,750
I'm built different.

2550
01:50:59,890 --> 01:51:02,310
Are you good?

2551
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:05,710
I think I'm doing Gangnam Style right now.

2552
01:51:06,230 --> 01:51:07,690
Hey, sexy lady!

2553
01:51:12,430 --> 01:51:14,690
I did a flip even.

2554
01:51:14,910 --> 01:51:15,310
Oh my god.

2555
01:51:15,470 --> 01:51:15,870
Get it, man.

2556
01:51:16,130 --> 01:51:16,270
Get it.

2557
01:51:16,290 --> 01:51:17,570
Welcome back, Froggy.

2558
01:51:17,870 --> 01:51:18,350
Watch this.

2559
01:51:18,670 --> 01:51:20,170
Thank you.

2560
01:51:20,270 --> 01:51:20,610
Woo.

2561
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:27,900
Woo.

2562
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:30,240
Hell yeah, brother.

2563
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:37,160
I'm learning.

2564
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:38,400
Oh, you're learning.

2565
01:51:39,020 --> 01:51:40,500
Oh, you found the email.

2566
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:41,600
Yeah.

2567
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:43,720
Yeah.

2568
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:44,400
Oh, yeah.

2569
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:46,900
That is my favorite thing.

2570
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:47,040
Backflip.

2571
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:48,340
Ah.

2572
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:49,400
Ah.

2573
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:51,500
Oh my god, it's so fun.

2574
01:51:51,580 --> 01:51:53,020
The flip is so funny.

2575
01:51:54,740 --> 01:51:56,280
I give you a hook shot.

2576
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:57,340
I give you a hook shot.

2577
01:51:57,580 --> 01:51:58,020
Oh, thank you.

2578
01:51:58,020 --> 01:51:59,860
Wait, I think I need more space.

2579
01:52:00,020 --> 01:52:00,440
Uh-oh.

2580
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:01,500
Emo.

2581
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:03,560
Uh.

2582
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:05,160
Escape.

2583
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:06,240
Maybe E.

2584
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:08,080
Now B.

2585
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:09,200
Oh, I did it.

2586
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:09,480
I did it.

2587
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:10,660
Okay, nice, nice.

2588
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:11,780
Nice.

2589
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:13,020
Yay.

2590
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:13,700
Oh.

2591
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:16,840
You can go up like this.

2592
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:18,000
It's like a hook shot.

2593
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:18,620
Okay.

2594
01:52:18,860 --> 01:52:19,600
Let me see.

2595
01:52:19,660 --> 01:52:20,940
There's so much space down here.

2596
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:21,580
Where is it?

2597
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:23,620
Oh, here it is.

2598
01:52:23,940 --> 01:52:24,740
There's so much space for activities.

2599
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:26,480
Hey, Froggy.

2600
01:52:26,660 --> 01:52:27,820
There's so much space for activities.

2601
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:28,480
You have an Electro.

2602
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,500
Why did you just, why did you not just glide down?

2603
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:31,400
I forgot.

2604
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:33,080
Like this.

2605
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:36,340
That's understandable, I guess.

2606
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:38,040
I'm ordering food, okay?

2607
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:38,740
My head is out.

2608
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:40,620
Oh, I did it.

2609
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:41,220
Wait, I just finished eating.

2610
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:44,520
Wait, are you eating sometimes?

2611
01:52:44,940 --> 01:52:46,140
Yeah, just like that.

2612
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:46,720
Okay.

2613
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:48,000
Easy peasy.

2614
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:48,780
Thank you.

2615
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:51,020
Of course, of course!

2616
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:58,360
Do you wanna put down some of your stuff because you tell me
that you're fooling now?

2617
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:00,600
Oh, I have a backpack now, I'm okay.

2618
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:02,100
Okay, okay.

2619
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:04,800
Sorry, I have to pee.

2620
01:53:04,900 --> 01:53:05,500
Don't let me die.

2621
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:06,380
Okay.

2622
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:07,360
Don't let me die.

2623
01:53:07,860 --> 01:53:08,140
Okay.

2624
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:09,300
Okay, I have to pee.

2625
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:10,380
Okay, go pee.

2626
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:13,120
Diamond.

2627
01:53:15,940 --> 01:53:16,220
Peace.

2628
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:18,220
Kella!

2629
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:20,580
Yeah!

2630
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,280
Take her down.

2631
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:26,820
Oh no!

2632
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:28,680
She's suffocating!

2633
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:34,500
You didn't kill her.

2634
01:53:34,780 --> 01:53:35,540
She suffocated.

2635
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:38,440
Yeah, that's a tragedy, Dale.

2636
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:41,880
How'd that happen?

2637
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:43,000
That's so weird.

2638
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:44,200
Wow, wow.

2639
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:45,440
I think it bugged.

2640
01:53:45,460 --> 01:53:46,680
Yeah, the bugged.

2641
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:48,600
It's a weird glitch.

2642
01:53:49,140 --> 01:53:50,600
She's gonna see that she suffocated.

2643
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:51,880
That's not possible.

2644
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:54,200
Yeah, you need to.

2645
01:53:55,140 --> 01:53:55,820
Okay, there we go.

2646
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:57,580
I think it's dead.

2647
01:53:57,580 --> 01:53:57,820
No!

2648
01:53:58,320 --> 01:53:58,400
Oh!

2649
01:54:01,010 --> 01:54:01,490
No!

2650
01:54:02,550 --> 01:54:02,970
Oh.

2651
01:54:03,610 --> 01:54:03,930
Oh.

2652
01:54:04,950 --> 01:54:06,890
You're so strong in there.

2653
01:54:07,270 --> 01:54:07,970
Thank you.

2654
01:54:08,050 --> 01:54:09,230
No one- You got the really good armor.

2655
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:09,710
Yeah.

2656
01:54:09,710 --> 01:54:12,610
If it wasn't the consequences of my own actions.

2657
01:54:16,270 --> 01:54:16,750
Oh.

2658
01:54:17,110 --> 01:54:17,310
Oh.

2659
01:54:18,050 --> 01:54:18,530
Oh.

2660
01:54:18,530 --> 01:54:20,570
My hands were glitched so I couldn't switch to my weapon.

2661
01:54:21,210 --> 01:54:21,790
Uh-oh.

2662
01:54:22,150 --> 01:54:23,070
But I'm good now.

2663
01:54:23,090 --> 01:54:23,810
I can take him down.

2664
01:54:23,830 --> 01:54:25,790
Real good, real good.

2665
01:54:25,790 --> 01:54:26,430
Get him!

2666
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:27,690
Get him!

2667
01:54:27,810 --> 01:54:27,990
Get him!

2668
01:54:28,010 --> 01:54:28,930
Get him!

2669
01:54:28,990 --> 01:54:31,950
Oh, yeah, I was gonna die.

2670
01:54:32,230 --> 01:54:32,910
What's this?

2671
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:34,930
I got a bugger.

2672
01:54:35,290 --> 01:54:36,730
Oh, experience nugget.

2673
01:54:37,830 --> 01:54:38,290
Ew!

2674
01:54:39,010 --> 01:54:41,310
I thought it was a bugger.

2675
01:54:42,210 --> 01:54:44,090
It was an experience nugget.

2676
01:54:44,510 --> 01:54:45,150
What is that?

2677
01:54:45,310 --> 01:54:47,010
Oh yeah!

2678
01:54:47,730 --> 01:54:50,030
You cloud and uh...

2679
01:54:50,030 --> 01:54:50,570
Oh yeah!

2680
01:54:50,810 --> 01:54:51,810
You can use it.

2681
01:54:52,030 --> 01:54:52,270
Nice!

2682
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:54,850
Oh wait!

2683
01:54:56,550 --> 01:54:56,790
Yeah?

2684
01:54:56,990 --> 01:54:59,630
Here, I don't know if this is better than what you have, but
that's a really good sword.

2685
01:54:59,770 --> 01:54:59,970
Oh!

2686
01:55:00,970 --> 01:55:01,790
What is this?

2687
01:55:03,130 --> 01:55:04,590
Oh, thank you!

2688
01:55:04,670 --> 01:55:07,090
Oh my god, I've studied the blade.

2689
01:55:08,230 --> 01:55:09,710
Oh, you look cool!

2690
01:55:09,910 --> 01:55:10,350
I do.

2691
01:55:10,590 --> 01:55:11,290
She studied the blade.

2692
01:55:11,510 --> 01:55:12,910
You look like a Raiden, Raiden!

2693
01:55:13,570 --> 01:55:13,990
Raiden!

2694
01:55:18,430 --> 01:55:19,750
Yeah, I'm Raiden!

2695
01:55:20,370 --> 01:55:20,690
Yeah, I'm Raiden!

2696
01:55:22,950 --> 01:55:23,390

Nope.

2704
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:37,980
Nope.

2705
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:39,000
No treasure.

2706
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:40,140
No treasure.

2707
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:44,740
Sometimes it goes further down and sometimes it can bite it,
but I'm not sure about that.

2708
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:45,240
Oh!

2709
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:47,780
Nice kill!

2710
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:49,200
Nice kill.

2711
01:56:49,420 --> 01:56:51,840
Oh my gosh, she's so cute, the little body.

2712
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:55,920
I'm gonna take him home.

2713
01:56:59,820 --> 01:57:01,080
Oh, you want him?

2714
01:57:01,220 --> 01:57:02,400
Yeah, I want this guy.

2715
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:03,000
Is it okay?

2716
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:03,480
Mm-hmm.

2717
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:04,520
Yeah!

2718
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:06,000
Zayn?

2719
01:57:06,020 --> 01:57:06,780
There we go.

2720
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,100
Thank you!

2721
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:09,800
Zayn!

2722
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:11,640
Zayn!

2723
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:11,740
Zayn!

2724
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:15,460
Hi, Zayn.

2725
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:17,200
Oh.

2726
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:21,700
She immediately died.

2727
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:23,400
Oh.

2728
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:25,080
Oh.

2729
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:25,480
Oh.

2730
01:57:25,480 --> 01:57:25,520
Oh.

2731
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:25,600
Kale.

2732
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:28,600
Is she- I should have...

2733
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:28,980
Da-Yon!

2734
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:31,880
.

2735
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:39,840
Zen here!

2736
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:42,560
Why is my chat telling me to run?

2737
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:44,900
Uh oh.

2738
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:48,340
She got on, die, and left.

2739
01:57:50,140 --> 01:57:50,780
Never mind.

2740
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:52,200
I guess we're safe, everybody.

2741
01:57:53,660 --> 01:57:54,600
Good job, Zen.

2742
01:57:57,660 --> 01:57:58,300
Alright.

2743
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:00,900
I'm gonna go this way.

2744
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:01,700
Yeah.

2745
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:05,560
I'm following you guys, because I'm weak.

2746
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:09,340
Nice kill!

2747
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:10,280
I'm about to die.

2748
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:10,820
No!

2749
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:12,900
Yeah!

2750
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:14,240
Nice, nice!

2751
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:16,580
Treasure!

2752
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:19,080
I'm getting so many chains.

2753
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:20,800
Yeah, me too.

2754
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:23,600
You can't hit me!

2755
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:24,820
No, no, no, no, no, no!

2756
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:27,520
There's so many chests.

2757
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:28,280
Oh!

2758
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:30,500
That sounded close.

2759
01:58:31,580 --> 01:58:33,900
Yeah, I have one heart left, so I'm just like...

2760
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:35,380
Do you need some flash?

2761
01:58:36,660 --> 01:58:38,580
I have some guts for you.

2762
01:58:39,700 --> 01:58:40,840
You can eat guts?

2763
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:41,280
Yeah!

2764
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:42,680
They're delicious.

2765
01:58:43,020 --> 01:58:43,560
Yeah, you can eat it.

2766
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:44,300
You can eat it.

2767
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:45,160
Oh, that is back.

2768
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:46,600
I got a nutcracker.

2769
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,540
A nutcracker, nice!

2770
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:52,240
Oh.

2771
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:56,440
I have a food, so I can give you guys if you want to.

2772
01:58:58,180 --> 01:58:59,120
What does this do?

2773
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:05,040
It deals critical damage to frozen and stunned enemies.

2774
01:59:05,260 --> 01:59:05,520
Ah!

2775
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:07,860
Cool.

2776
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:09,940
Nice, nice.

2777
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:14,020
What's a runic tablet?

2778
01:59:16,020 --> 01:59:17,520
I never used it before.

2779
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:21,020
I think it's for fixing weapons?

2780
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:23,820
I think?

2781
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,380
Time to break some nuts.

2782
01:59:28,930 --> 01:59:29,390
Yay!

2783
01:59:29,730 --> 01:59:30,070
Yeah!

2784
01:59:30,330 --> 01:59:31,070
I took it.

2785
01:59:31,490 --> 01:59:32,210
Oh, you took it?

2786
01:59:32,850 --> 01:59:33,370
I can put it.

2787
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:33,850
Here we go.

2788
01:59:34,070 --> 01:59:34,810
Oh, thank you.

2789
01:59:35,010 --> 01:59:35,210
Right here.

2790
01:59:36,090 --> 01:59:37,070
Thank you very much.

2791
01:59:38,030 --> 01:59:38,510
Yeah!

2792
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:46,360
Not a thing.

2793
01:59:47,220 --> 01:59:47,880
Not a thing.

2794
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:49,180
I love how...

2795
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:53,000
Every time I get on Minecraft, I do everything but the thing
I got on Minecraft do.

2796
01:59:53,740 --> 01:59:55,480
That's how it goes, isn't it?

2797
01:59:56,940 --> 02:00:00,420
Oh my gosh, with this I'm gonna be exploring forever though.

2798
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:01,760
I'm gonna...

2799
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:02,480
Oh, I know the dungeons.

2800
02:00:02,900 --> 02:00:05,360
Yeah, I'm gonna be going through the dungeons forever.

2801
02:00:05,780 --> 02:00:07,080
Stealing all the bodies.

2802
02:00:08,060 --> 02:00:10,560
There are like so many things to do in this game.

2803
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:11,820
It's a lot.

2804
02:00:11,900 --> 02:00:12,520
It's a lot.

2805
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,300
Oh no, I broke him!

2806
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:17,580
Oh, maybe it has to be a silk touch.

2807
02:00:17,780 --> 02:00:18,440
I think so.

2808
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:20,420
It has to be silk touch to take the bodies.

2809
02:00:20,860 --> 02:00:21,180
Oh no.

2810
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:23,380
That's okay.

2811
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:24,600
I have silk touch.

2812
02:00:25,740 --> 02:00:27,940
I think I only need one stinky man.

2813
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,140
Oh, one thing.

2814
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:33,660
Why not two stinky men or three stinky men?

2815
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:34,300
You know what?

2816
02:00:34,340 --> 02:00:35,080
You're so right.

2817
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:36,380
You're so right.

2818
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:38,280
Why not have more stinky men?

2819
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:40,380
Yeah, only so the extra stinky.

2820
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:42,180

Anytime.

We know you can get the cardboard!

2833
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:36,860
Why is it cool down?

2834
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:39,340
Just like a half-life!

2835
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:41,840
What?

2836
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:43,060
Where do I get this from?

2837
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:45,080
From even?

2838
02:01:46,180 --> 02:01:46,780
No!

2839
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:48,200
Uh-oh.

2840
02:01:48,620 --> 02:01:48,860
Oh.

2841
02:01:49,580 --> 02:01:51,160
You're not protecting me?

2842
02:01:51,680 --> 02:01:52,540
Am I supposed to?

2843
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:53,340
Yep.

2844
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:56,560
Oh, you came back so I didn't think that was my job anymore.

2845
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:58,560
Lynn, I found your stinky guy.

2846
02:01:58,960 --> 02:01:59,540
You did!

2847
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:00,720
Yeah!

2848
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:01,580
You want him?

2849
02:02:03,340 --> 02:02:04,220
Let's see.

2850
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:04,840
Whoa!

2851
02:02:06,100 --> 02:02:07,060
Yeah, I'll take him.

2852
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:07,560
I'll take him.

2853
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:10,260
There you go.

2854
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:11,300
Thank you!

2855
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:12,800
Oh my gosh.

2856
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:14,020
Now I have a corpse.

2857
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:15,400
I have a rotting corpse.

2858
02:02:15,540 --> 02:02:15,940
I have a skeleton.

2859
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:17,280
I have all three phases.

2860
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:18,600
You got all phases.

2861
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:19,540
Yeah!

2862
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:23,220
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2863
02:02:23,220 --> 02:02:23,280
Whoa, whoa.

2864
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:25,440
Whoa, whoa.

2865
02:02:27,160 --> 02:02:28,440
This is so exciting.

2866
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:35,840
I know.

2867
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:39,460
It's a lot of stuff.

2868
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:39,700
I know.

2869
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:42,540
Oh, you gotta find a place to build your house, too.

2870
02:02:42,820 --> 02:02:43,240
Yeah.

2871
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:44,060
Well, you're right.

2872
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:44,560
Yeah.

2873
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:45,960
There are so many places.

2874
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:48,780
Yeah, they're hard in so many biomes.

2875
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:50,040
There are so many places.

2876
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:50,700
Let's put this up here.

2877
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:51,760
Oh, thanks, guys.

2878
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:52,560
Okay.

2879
02:02:52,580 --> 02:02:54,580
Let's see if I'm gonna go.

2880
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:58,580
The only thing I would suggest is not building near the
spawn because it gets a little laggy.

2881
02:02:59,220 --> 02:03:00,560
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2882
02:03:00,860 --> 02:03:01,100
Okay.

2883
02:03:01,880 --> 02:03:03,580
I will not do that.

2884
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:05,560
Mike,

2885
02:03:09,240 --> 02:03:11,720
Chad, I love we still exploring a froggy's house.

2886
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:12,560
That's true!

2887
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:13,980
We're still in the froggy's house.

2888
02:03:14,340 --> 02:03:14,820
You're right!

2889
02:03:15,340 --> 02:03:16,420
Oh my god, technically, yeah.

2890
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:16,860
You're right!

2891
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:18,620
The frog's dungeon.

2892
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,120
Yeah, there's just the biggest house.

2893
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:24,560
So many rooms.

2894
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:25,900
She got the biggest house.

2895
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:32,820
I didn't know you had a big basement or prison.

2896
02:03:33,220 --> 02:03:33,600
Yeah.

2897
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:36,220
This is where my mods live.

2898
02:03:36,780 --> 02:03:39,300
Why does mom let you have a basement?

2899
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:43,560
Your mods live in a basement too?

2900
02:03:44,720 --> 02:03:45,600
Mine too!

2901
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:47,360
Oh no.

2902
02:03:48,220 --> 02:03:49,220
I'm taking care of you guys.

2903
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:51,980
It's okay.

2904
02:03:52,580 --> 02:03:54,700
Oh my god.

2905
02:03:55,180 --> 02:03:55,380
Oh,

2906
02:04:00,030 --> 02:04:00,030
okay.

2907
02:04:00,530 --> 02:04:00,970
I'm okay.

2908
02:04:02,570 --> 02:04:03,230
Oh!

2909
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:13,580
I can handle myself.

2910
02:04:19,240 --> 02:04:19,880
Yeah.

2911
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:21,680
But I couldn't find the boss.

2912
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:22,740
Uh-huh.

2913
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:25,600
Maybe you have to summon him with the item.

2914
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:45,340
Where are you guys?

2915
02:04:46,260 --> 02:04:47,540
How did she die?

2916
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:49,420
I'm behind you.

2917
02:04:49,580 --> 02:04:49,620
I'm behind you.

2918
02:04:49,620 --> 02:04:50,200
You're behind me?

2919
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:50,500
Hi.

No.

Wait, can we?

2926
02:05:06,750 --> 02:05:08,870

Yeah.

2928
02:05:10,410 --> 02:05:11,610

Ooh.

Yeah.

2950
02:07:05,300 --> 02:07:06,320
You should take it.

Oh my gosh, you guys.

2959
02:07:20,740 --> 02:07:22,500
I think I'm obsessed with the mines.

2960
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:23,860
Not the mines.

2961
02:07:24,040 --> 02:07:24,860
The dungeons.

2962
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:27,960
Oh my god, I will never leave the dungeons.

2963
02:07:28,900 --> 02:07:29,260
Ouch.

2964
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:31,560

For guts to eat.

2998
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:35,540
Eat, is it?

2999
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:36,220

02:09:45,070 --> 02:09:45,790
My bad, my bad.

3004
02:09:47,030 --> 02:09:47,910
It's delicious.

3005
02:09:48,130 --> 02:09:49,630
Yeah, you gotta try it.

3006
02:09:49,630 --> 02:09:51,070
I say that but I'm also eating the guts.

3007
02:09:51,450 --> 02:09:52,650
I'm just trying not to think about it.

3008
02:09:52,770 --> 02:09:55,030
Don't knock it till you try it.

3009
02:09:55,670 --> 02:09:56,110
Wait.

3010
02:09:56,710 --> 02:09:58,250
Treasure, more treasure over here.

3011
02:09:58,310 --> 02:09:59,350
Is it this way that I haven't been?

3012
02:09:59,350 --> 02:10:00,170
How much treasure everywhere?

3013
02:10:01,070 --> 02:10:01,850
This way, this way.

3014
02:10:01,850 --> 02:10:02,150
Oh, this way.

3015
02:10:02,250 --> 02:10:03,150
There's more of them.

3016
02:10:03,650 --> 02:10:05,350
There's so much treasure.

3017
02:10:06,130 --> 02:10:07,590
I know, I know.

3018
02:10:07,670 --> 02:10:09,170
This is all you get, the good stuff.

3019
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:10,190
Nice.

3020
02:10:10,810 --> 02:10:11,190
Oh.

3021
02:10:11,970 --> 02:10:12,410
Oh.

3022
02:10:12,630 --> 02:10:13,830
You can see where I found thunder.

3023
02:10:13,830 --> 02:10:13,970
Ow!

3024
02:10:15,430 --> 02:10:16,290
Oh, really?

3025
02:10:16,790 --> 02:10:18,830
Yeah, isn't a dungeon like this?

3026
02:10:21,210 --> 02:10:24,050
I guess I just got really lucky.

3027
02:10:24,570 --> 02:10:25,350
You found what?

3028
02:10:26,450 --> 02:10:27,950
My weapon, Thunderbrand.

3029
02:10:28,270 --> 02:10:29,310
It's a really strong weapon.

3030
02:10:29,850 --> 02:10:29,870
Oh!

3031
02:10:30,430 --> 02:10:31,030
Thunderbrand, though.

3032
02:10:31,030 --> 02:10:31,950
So it's a gotcha.

3033
02:10:33,170 --> 02:10:33,850
Oh, what's this?

3034
02:10:34,090 --> 02:10:35,590
Yeah, it's kind of like a gotcha every time.

3035
02:10:35,590 --> 02:10:36,470
Oh, crowbar.

3036
02:10:40,310 --> 02:10:43,310
Yeah, you need a crowbar just like in the life...

3037
02:10:44,130 --> 02:10:45,630
Half-life.

3038
02:10:46,190 --> 02:10:47,550
Half-life!

3039
02:10:50,030 --> 02:10:51,030
Morgan Freeman!

3040
02:10:51,450 --> 02:10:52,350
Morgan Freeman!

3041
02:10:53,130 --> 02:10:55,730
Morgan Freeman!

3042
02:10:55,850 --> 02:10:56,850
Oh, watch out!

3043
02:10:58,030 --> 02:10:59,570
Morgan Freeman!

3044
02:11:01,430 --> 02:11:01,690
Oh.

3045
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:04,800
Uh-oh.

3046
02:11:05,560 --> 02:11:05,560
I

3047
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:12,580
died too.

3048
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:18,480
I wonder where I should build my house.

3049
02:11:21,180 --> 02:11:23,180
I wonder where I should build it.

3050
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:28,300
And you know who's Black Mesa now?

3051
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:29,400
Finally.

3052
02:11:31,260 --> 02:11:33,360
Morgan Freeman, Morgan Freeman, Morgan Freeman.

3053
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:40,950
I think that taught me really, really well, isn't it?

3054
02:11:42,670 --> 02:11:43,630
Welcome back!

3055
02:11:43,770 --> 02:11:44,170
Thank you!

3056
02:11:44,530 --> 02:11:46,130
Born to SAS people.

3057
02:11:48,430 --> 02:11:49,170
SOS Dayup.

3058
02:11:49,670 --> 02:11:50,950
SOS Dayup.

3059
02:11:53,330 --> 02:11:53,970
What's so?

3060
02:11:53,990 --> 02:11:54,330
Suss.

3061
02:11:56,370 --> 02:11:58,390
Are you being suss, Hena?

3062
02:11:59,210 --> 02:12:00,170
No, she's being suss.

3063
02:12:00,170 --> 02:12:01,490
No, I'm being suss.

3064
02:12:01,750 --> 02:12:02,090
No.

3065
02:12:02,670 --> 02:12:03,150
Sassy.

3066
02:12:03,490 --> 02:12:03,950
Sassy.

3067
02:12:05,450 --> 02:12:05,930
Sassy.

3068
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:06,830
Sassy.

3069
02:12:06,910 --> 02:12:07,570
Sassy or sassy?

3070
02:12:07,810 --> 02:12:08,370
What's the difference?

3071
02:12:08,910 --> 02:12:13,530
When you're like, when you're like, skillish, you die, when
you're mocking me, that's being sassy, Hena.

3072
02:12:15,130 --> 02:12:17,330
No, you die, no, you die.

3073
02:12:17,690 --> 02:12:19,470
No, you'd be genius.

3074
02:12:21,030 --> 02:12:22,330
I have to believe.

3075
02:12:22,330 --> 02:12:23,910
Geniuses are often sassy, you know.

3076
02:12:27,250 --> 02:12:29,630
Let's see Is it inventory full?

3077
02:12:30,010 --> 02:12:31,130
No, it's okay though.

3078
02:12:31,530 --> 02:12:32,950
I got lots of room still.

3079
02:12:33,690 --> 02:12:34,710
Nice, nice.

3080
02:12:35,390 --> 02:12:37,030
Yeah, I'm ready to keep collecting.

3081
02:12:38,610 --> 02:12:41,310
I think you were almost done in this floor?

3082
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:42,030
Yeah.

3083
02:12:42,170 --> 02:12:43,150
I think we went everywhere.

3084
02:12:43,470 --> 02:12:44,370
I think so too.

3085
02:12:47,030 --> 02:12:48,890
Is there a chest?

3086
02:12:49,150 --> 02:12:50,770
Have we gone all the way down here?

3087
02:12:51,590 --> 02:12:52,130
Oh, I don't know.

3088
02:12:52,430 --> 02:12:52,650
What's so?

3089
02:12:55,230 --> 02:12:55,950
Which way?

3090
02:12:56,030 --> 02:12:58,290
We went that way.

3091
02:12:58,550 --> 02:12:59,110
This way.

3092
02:13:00,130 --> 02:13:01,110
We came from this way.

3093
02:13:02,030 --> 02:13:06,050
Yeah, so then have we gone all the way over here then?

3094
02:13:07,170 --> 02:13:07,810
Back here?

3095
02:13:08,810 --> 02:13:09,190
Yeah.

3096
02:13:10,470 --> 02:13:11,990
Because this part isn't even on the map.

3097
02:13:12,950 --> 02:13:14,050
Yeah, you're right.

3098
02:13:16,530 --> 02:13:17,890
Well, I haven't gotten this one.

3099
02:13:18,030 --> 02:13:18,570
Oh, me neither.

3100
02:13:21,570 --> 02:13:22,430
That's why we double check.

3101
02:13:22,630 --> 02:13:23,210
Yeah, I think we have.

3102
02:13:23,430 --> 02:13:24,470
I think we have.

3103
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:26,430
Hmm.

3104
02:13:27,690 --> 02:13:29,270
Going this way.

3105
02:13:29,850 --> 02:13:30,950
This way.

3106
02:13:30,970 --> 02:13:31,950
Outer heaven.

3107
02:13:32,630 --> 02:13:34,170
Well, I think I've gone this way.

3108
02:13:35,570 --> 02:13:36,830
I think this is where I just was.

3109
02:13:40,550 --> 02:13:43,810
Apparently this mod is inspired by the game.

3110
02:13:43,930 --> 02:13:44,950
It's called Dead Cell?

3111
02:13:46,050 --> 02:13:46,290
Oh!

3112
02:13:46,450 --> 02:13:47,550
It didn't look like that.

3113
02:13:48,330 --> 02:13:48,570
Oh!

3114
02:13:49,470 --> 02:13:51,330
I got...

3115
02:13:51,330 --> 02:13:51,970
Thank you.

3116
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:54,310
I thought I was a goner.

3117
02:13:56,030 --> 02:13:57,390
I think we've been everywhere.

3118
02:13:57,510 --> 02:13:59,530
Yeah, I think so, I think so.

3119
02:13:59,790 --> 02:14:00,970
Oh, another broadsword.

3120
02:14:04,570 --> 02:14:04,610
Hmm.

3121
02:14:05,790 --> 02:14:07,070
No, no, no, no, no.

3122
02:14:07,850 --> 02:14:08,810
No, no, no, no.

3123
02:14:09,570 --> 02:14:11,070
Oh, God.

3124
02:14:13,570 --> 02:14:14,990
Zelda is universal.

3125
02:14:15,870 --> 02:14:17,350
I love Zelda.

3126
02:14:17,610 --> 02:14:18,590
Power two.

3127
02:14:18,730 --> 02:14:18,990
Blah.

3128
02:14:23,560 --> 02:14:24,120
Guts.

3129
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:26,180
Oh, I didn't open this one.

3130
02:14:26,260 --> 02:14:26,980
More guts.

3131
02:14:28,300 --> 02:14:31,500
Guts are a balanced, well-balanced breakfast.

3132
02:14:46,080 --> 02:14:52,000
I think that's it for Froggy's basement tour.

3133
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:53,580
Yeah, I think so too.

3134
02:14:56,080 --> 02:14:56,780
Oh, hi Matara!

3135
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:58,220
You guys haven't even seen Va.

3136
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:01,120
Oh, is it Matara here?

3137
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:02,460
Yeah, she's in my chat.

3138
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:03,840
She's calling me a freak.

3139
02:15:04,860 --> 02:15:05,420
What?

3140
02:15:05,580 --> 02:15:06,540
She's calling you a freak.

3141
02:15:07,040 --> 02:15:08,660
Yeah, I don't know why.

3142
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:10,860
Why am I a freak?

3143
02:15:12,140 --> 02:15:12,200
Mana!

3144
02:15:13,780 --> 02:15:15,660
Are you talking about my present from Hanya?

3145
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:17,380
Mana!

3146
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:23,380
It's my very precious presents.

3147
02:15:24,440 --> 02:15:25,360
Yeah, precious things.

3148
02:15:26,440 --> 02:15:28,380
Yeah, I want to place it in her house.

3149
02:15:30,700 --> 02:15:31,820
Lakara Khan!

3150
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:37,740
A freak.

3151
02:15:38,480 --> 02:15:40,640
I am a freaky ghostman.

3152
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:45,360
Can we go back to spawn and see other stuff?

3153
02:15:45,740 --> 02:15:46,560
Yeah, I guess so.

3154
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:47,320
Look around other stuff?

3155
02:15:47,540 --> 02:15:48,520
Yeah, I guess so.

3156
02:15:48,920 --> 02:15:50,580
And spawn time.

3157
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:51,100
Spawn.

3158
02:15:51,320 --> 02:15:52,140
To the spawn.

3159
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:54,120
Oh.

3160
02:15:55,100 --> 02:15:55,700
Spawn.

3161
02:15:57,400 --> 02:15:59,780
We definitely just abandoned Froggy in there.

3162
02:16:00,220 --> 02:16:00,880
Oh, you're right.

3163
02:16:02,780 --> 02:16:03,700
That'll be fine.

3164
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:04,600
It's probably okay.

3165
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:05,340
What is this?

3166
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:06,440
Yeah, she got this.

3167
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:07,140
She'll be fine.

3168
02:16:07,260 --> 02:16:08,220
She'll be fine.

3169
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:08,640
That.

3170
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:10,200
Where else should we go?

3171
02:16:10,540 --> 02:16:13,540
Oh, I see, uh, the gun run in the sky is gone.

3172
02:16:14,140 --> 02:16:15,680
There was a gun run in the sky.

3173
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:19,300
Wait, there was a giant painting of gun run in the sky.

3174
02:16:20,620 --> 02:16:22,820
Wait, why did it get rid of it?

3175
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:23,720
I don't know.

3176
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:24,520
I got on the other day.

3177
02:16:24,520 --> 02:16:25,420
There's these ones.

3178
02:16:25,820 --> 02:16:27,020
I wanted to see it.

3179
02:16:27,060 --> 02:16:28,160
That's so perfect.

3180
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:29,540
They're really curves.

3181
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:34,340
Oh, those are so cute.

3182
02:16:34,340 --> 02:16:35,900
These ones are so cursed.

3183
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:38,320
Oh, oh,

3184
02:16:42,340 --> 02:16:42,840
yeah, there's...

3185
02:16:44,620 --> 02:16:45,580
These one...

3186
02:16:45,580 --> 02:16:47,100
These beautiful portraits.

3187
02:16:47,340 --> 02:16:48,520
Who made it?

3188
02:16:48,780 --> 02:16:50,320
It's genius, Kaya.

3189
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:52,740
Those are perfect.

3190
02:16:53,140 --> 02:16:54,020
I love those.

3191
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:55,800
I love it, too.

3192
02:16:55,980 --> 02:16:56,260
I love it, too.

3193
02:16:56,260 --> 02:16:57,880
The eyes are so scary.

3194
02:17:00,020 --> 02:17:00,680
Oh, my God.

3195
02:17:01,140 --> 02:17:04,160
I got rid of the Gundam sun in the sky because it was a
lagging.

3196
02:17:04,880 --> 02:17:05,520
Oh!

3197
02:17:06,620 --> 02:17:08,760
Oh, I beat it.

3198
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:09,860
The Piggy's turn.

3199
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:10,640
Oh!

3200
02:17:16,100 --> 02:17:17,260
What happened?

3201
02:17:19,640 --> 02:17:20,280
Oh!

3202
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:21,180
Oh!

3203
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:21,740
Oh!

3204
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:29,860
Now should I run?

3205
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:32,800
She just... What just happened?

3206
02:17:33,180 --> 02:17:33,920
Right click the button.

3207
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:35,040
Right click the button.

3208
02:17:36,480 --> 02:17:37,360
Oh my god.

3209
02:17:37,660 --> 02:17:37,680
Oh!

3210
02:17:38,220 --> 02:17:38,860
Emergency!

3211
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:40,400
Emergency!

3212
02:17:40,700 --> 02:17:41,220
Emergency!

3213
02:17:41,780 --> 02:17:43,000
Hold on, Zen is up there.

3214
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:44,600
Oh, Zen is God.

3215
02:17:45,680 --> 02:17:46,080
Oh, what's this?

3216
02:17:47,340 --> 02:17:48,440
It's inventory, isn't it?

3217
02:17:49,100 --> 02:17:49,900
There's loot here.

3218
02:17:50,440 --> 02:17:50,740
Oh, yeah?

3219
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:53,000
Where is Zen?

3220
02:17:54,020 --> 02:17:54,420
Oh, there she is.

3221
02:17:54,600 --> 02:17:55,200
She left the game.

3222
02:17:55,720 --> 02:17:56,540
Oh, she left again?

3223
02:17:57,100 --> 02:17:57,300
Zen!

3224
02:17:57,300 --> 02:17:58,720
I was trying to say Zen!

3225
02:17:59,120 --> 02:17:59,720
She left the game.

3226
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:00,720
I was going to find Minutaur.

3227
02:18:00,720 --> 02:18:01,640
You intimidated her.

3228
02:18:03,820 --> 02:18:05,220
Was my genius power.

3229
02:18:09,230 --> 02:18:12,790
Do you have any idea that you want to build a house on or
something?

3230
02:18:13,210 --> 02:18:14,290
I don't know where, yeah.

3231
02:18:14,590 --> 02:18:15,710
I'll find somewhere.

3232
02:18:16,470 --> 02:18:16,710
Maybe.

3233
02:18:18,510 --> 02:18:20,370
You want to see other people's house?

3234
02:18:20,770 --> 02:18:21,150
Yeah!

3235
02:18:22,670 --> 02:18:23,230
Okay.

3236
02:18:23,450 --> 02:18:26,870
Oh, I want to show you the, um, Amuchi place, so hold on.

3237
02:18:26,930 --> 02:18:27,650
Oh, okay, okay.

3238
02:18:28,050 --> 02:18:29,750
Oh, Michi's place is so nice.

3239
02:18:29,830 --> 02:18:30,110
Wait!

3240
02:18:30,550 --> 02:18:30,810
Wait!

3241
02:18:31,270 --> 02:18:32,450
Oh, you're on my head?

3242
02:18:33,870 --> 02:18:34,430
Okay.

3243
02:18:34,850 --> 02:18:35,190
Wait!

3244
02:18:37,290 --> 02:18:38,770
Oh, I had you!

3245
02:18:41,070 --> 02:18:41,630
Oh.

3246
02:18:43,030 --> 02:18:43,610
Maybe this.

3247
02:18:43,850 --> 02:18:44,290

Here we go.

What am I wearing?

3257
02:19:55,320 --> 02:19:55,380
Oh.

02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:01,020
Thank you.

3259
02:20:01,540 --> 02:20:02,600
Am I normal again?

3260
02:20:03,220 --> 02:20:03,780
Yeah, you're normal.

3261
02:20:03,860 --> 02:20:04,460
Yeah, you are.

3262
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,480
This is a good place.

3263
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:12,800
Oh, the chimes are so cool.

3264
02:20:13,900 --> 02:20:14,820
They are.

3265
02:20:15,300 --> 02:20:16,860
They make a good sound.

3266
02:20:17,660 --> 02:20:21,500
She also made this, like, a farm for the wool as well.

3267
02:20:24,440 --> 02:20:24,960
Oh.

3268
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:25,480
Oh.

3269
02:20:26,020 --> 02:20:27,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3270
02:20:27,560 --> 02:20:29,340
Your farming methods are so cute.

3271
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:30,600
It is.

3272
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:31,580
I know, right?

3273
02:20:31,700 --> 02:20:32,440
It is.

3274
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:33,780
It looks so adorable.

3275
02:20:33,900 --> 02:20:35,040
Wait, how does it farm?

3276
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:42,320
Oh, I think there's, like, scissor inside and sheer sheer
inside.

3277
02:20:42,580 --> 02:20:43,360
Oh, I see it.

3278
02:20:44,460 --> 02:20:47,720
But I think it's not working because the shoes are broken.

3279
02:20:48,700 --> 02:20:50,060
Oh, it's down here!

3280
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:51,980
It's all working, I think.

3281
02:20:53,580 --> 02:20:55,160
Oh, it's this snail thing again.

3282
02:20:57,300 --> 02:20:57,980
Oh, oh god!

3283
02:20:59,180 --> 02:21:00,700
Oh, my god.

3284
02:21:04,260 --> 02:21:04,460
Oh my god.

3285
02:21:05,300 --> 02:21:05,760
Oh.

3286
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:07,600
Oh, there we go.

3287
02:21:11,900 --> 02:21:12,500
Mmm.

3288
02:21:13,300 --> 02:21:13,880
Mmm.

3289
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:15,300
And this is her room.

3290
02:21:15,620 --> 02:21:16,460
Right here.

3291
02:21:17,360 --> 02:21:17,600
Whoa.

3292
02:21:19,940 --> 02:21:22,040
Oh my gosh, she also has dead people.

3293
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:24,100
Oh?

3294
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:25,900
Maybe I should add.

3295
02:21:26,040 --> 02:21:26,280
Here.

3296
02:21:27,780 --> 02:21:28,980
Rod and corpse.

3297
02:21:30,180 --> 02:21:30,660
Corpse.

3298
02:21:30,900 --> 02:21:31,100
Oh.

3299
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:33,600
Skelly man.

3300
02:21:34,700 --> 02:21:36,760
Corpse, corpse, skeleton man.

3301
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:38,700
I like the skeleton.

3302
02:21:39,060 --> 02:21:39,640
I do too.

3303
02:21:39,700 --> 02:21:40,500
He's really cute.

3304
02:21:40,840 --> 02:21:41,340
I like it.

3305
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:46,900
Also, when you put the The corpse on the ground, it makes
the mushy sound like...

3306
02:21:47,420 --> 02:21:48,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3307
02:21:51,940 --> 02:21:53,660
Whoa, wait, whose house is this?

3308
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:55,260
This is roots.

3309
02:21:55,580 --> 02:21:56,500
Oh, okay, okay.

3310
02:21:57,440 --> 02:21:59,360
Whoa, there's a piggy head too.

3311
02:22:00,420 --> 02:22:00,900
Yeah!

3312
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:04,140
They are, they are.

3313
02:22:05,020 --> 02:22:05,500
Ah!

3314
02:22:05,800 --> 02:22:07,280
I knew you were gonna do that.

3315
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:08,920
I knew you were gonna do that.

3316
02:22:09,460 --> 02:22:10,260
I'm safe!

3317
02:22:11,820 --> 02:22:12,040
Yeah!

3318
02:22:17,100 --> 02:22:18,980
I'll go around.

3319
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:20,900
I'll go down.

3320
02:22:21,060 --> 02:22:21,420
Here we go.

3321
02:22:21,580 --> 02:22:23,700
There we go.

3322
02:22:23,700 --> 02:22:24,340
What is this?

3323
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:26,740
Is there anything down here?

3324
02:22:27,340 --> 02:22:28,820
Oh wait, there is some stuff down here.

3325
02:22:29,400 --> 02:22:31,100
Oh, wait a minute.

3326
02:22:31,780 --> 02:22:35,080
This is where the treasure at, wasn't it?

3327
02:22:35,340 --> 02:22:35,600
Treasure?

3328
02:22:36,320 --> 02:22:36,860
More treasure?

3329
02:22:38,480 --> 02:22:40,620
Oh, what is that?

3330
02:22:40,840 --> 02:22:41,760
I think there's a treasure around here.

3331
02:22:46,070 --> 02:22:46,970
You're Good?

3332
02:22:48,190 --> 02:22:49,050
Yep, I'm okay!

3333
02:22:55,410 --> 02:22:57,370
Oh, there's a treasure, there's a treasure!

3334
02:22:57,730 --> 02:23:00,670
Oh, oh, oh, zombie.

3335
02:23:02,490 --> 02:23:06,950
Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, there's a lot of stuff in here.

3336
02:23:07,370 --> 02:23:07,670
Woo!

3337
02:23:09,710 --> 02:23:12,290
Wait, is this the same where it's different for everybody?

3338
02:23:13,310 --> 02:23:15,790
It's different for everybody, so you can take it.

3339
02:23:15,850 --> 02:23:16,630
Okay, okay, okay.

3340
02:23:16,790 --> 02:23:19,850
Except the regular chest, you can take everything inside.

3341
02:23:19,870 --> 02:23:20,610
Oh, nice!

3342
02:23:20,870 --> 02:23:21,250
Wow.

3343
02:23:21,630 --> 02:23:21,990
Yeah!

3344
02:23:22,610 --> 02:23:24,630
Oh my gosh, I'm actually gonna run out of space.

3345
02:23:26,710 --> 02:23:27,470
Tomato seeds!

3346
02:23:27,610 --> 02:23:28,430
Can you add the mimics to this?

3347
02:23:28,930 --> 02:23:33,150
They used to have a mimics, but I don't know, maybe it was
lagging the server.

3348
02:23:33,290 --> 02:23:34,130
It's good now.

3349
02:23:34,210 --> 02:23:34,890
What's a mimic?

3350
02:23:35,470 --> 02:23:37,450
Oh, like it would eat the, it would eat you.

3351
02:23:38,550 --> 02:23:41,250
Yeah, it's like a freedom, but it's gone now.

3352
02:23:41,690 --> 02:23:42,430
Aw, man.

3353
02:23:43,350 --> 02:23:43,630
No!

3354
02:23:45,250 --> 02:23:46,650
Freyren, some more.

3355
02:23:46,790 --> 02:23:47,130
Oh wait.

3356
02:23:47,670 --> 02:23:48,270
Take these.

3357
02:23:49,110 --> 02:23:49,470
Mm-hmm.

3358
02:23:51,630 --> 02:23:53,650
Yeah, I think that's the treasure.

3359
02:23:56,870 --> 02:23:58,610
I'm about to tell you important things.

3360
02:23:59,030 --> 02:23:59,310
Yeah.

3361
02:24:00,230 --> 02:24:02,910
Do you remember the place that we changed the heights?

3362
02:24:03,590 --> 02:24:04,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3363
02:24:04,950 --> 02:24:10,930
There is a green portal and when you go there, it leads to
like a mirror world from this one.

3364
02:24:11,070 --> 02:24:11,430
Oh.

3365
02:24:12,290 --> 02:24:13,890
That one is for like resource.

3366
02:24:14,130 --> 02:24:20,210
So when you get a lot of wood, when you want to get a little
wood or dirt or stuff like that, you can get it from there.

3367
02:24:20,710 --> 02:24:22,910
Oh, that's so awesome!

3368
02:24:23,730 --> 02:24:24,170
Yeah!

3369
02:24:24,330 --> 02:24:27,450
So you don't take everything from this world.

3370
02:24:27,850 --> 02:24:28,170
Oh!

3371
02:24:29,070 --> 02:24:35,110
Like if you want to keep the landscape, but you want to get
a lot of material in your world, I didn't get the oldest

3372
02:24:35,110 --> 02:24:35,890
stuff you need.

3373
02:24:36,130 --> 02:24:37,170
That's so smart!

3374
02:24:37,450 --> 02:24:38,430
That's so awesome!

3375
02:24:39,390 --> 02:24:40,090
Oh my god.

3376
02:24:41,490 --> 02:24:42,850
And yeah, this place is amazing.

3377
02:24:44,230 --> 02:24:45,030
It is!

3378
02:24:45,210 --> 02:24:49,330
It was my first time modding Minecraft as well, but I love
it so much.

3379
02:24:49,430 --> 02:24:49,870
Yeah!

3380
02:24:50,150 --> 02:24:51,170
I could say why.

3381
02:24:52,770 --> 02:24:53,650
I love it.

3382
02:24:53,670 --> 02:24:56,070
I think Zen is having connection problems.

3383
02:24:56,430 --> 02:24:57,110
Oh, no.

3384
02:24:57,350 --> 02:25:02,050
Yeah, I ran up to her when she was on, and she had, like,
that disconnect symbol next to her, and I think that's why

3385
02:25:02,050 --> 02:25:03,570
she keeps logging in and logging out.

3386
02:25:03,650 --> 02:25:04,050
Ah.

3387
02:25:04,970 --> 02:25:05,370
Oh.

3388
02:25:06,210 --> 02:25:08,290
Yeah, she's got connection problems, I think.

3389
02:25:08,750 --> 02:25:11,050
Oh, I wonder why is that happening to her?

3390
02:25:11,390 --> 02:25:12,050
I don't know.

3391
02:25:12,430 --> 02:25:14,870
No, I wish I could join her and join us.

3392
02:25:15,430 --> 02:25:15,830
Yeah.

3393
02:25:16,770 --> 02:25:17,170
Yeah.

3394
02:25:18,770 --> 02:25:20,150
That happened to Heavenly too?

3395
02:25:20,290 --> 02:25:21,070
Oh, no.

3396
02:25:21,190 --> 02:25:22,930
Yeah, Heavenly can't get on anymore.

3397
02:25:23,310 --> 02:25:23,650
Oh, really?

3398
02:25:23,670 --> 02:25:23,890
Really?

3399
02:25:25,070 --> 02:25:25,330
Oh.

3400
02:25:25,890 --> 02:25:26,770
All right, Zen!

3401
02:25:30,450 --> 02:25:31,290
Um...

3402
02:25:32,270 --> 02:25:33,110
Um...

3403
02:25:33,110 --> 02:25:33,510
Man!

3404
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:37,820
I think...

3405
02:25:37,820 --> 02:25:39,260
Maybe Zen is fine.

3406
02:25:40,040 --> 02:25:44,900
I think she's fine.

3407
02:25:45,180 --> 02:25:46,640
I think she's fine.

3408
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:47,120
Yeah.

3409
02:25:48,080 --> 02:25:49,980
You have to disconnect this.

3410
02:25:52,120 --> 02:25:54,160
I worried for no reason.

3411
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:55,200
I worried for no reason.

3412
02:25:55,320 --> 02:25:56,240
What's that?

3413
02:25:58,540 --> 02:25:59,060
What's that?

3414
02:26:01,740 --> 02:26:03,340
Oh, it's that guy again.

3415
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:04,420
What does this thing do?

3416
02:26:06,180 --> 02:26:07,980
What does he do this guy?

3417
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:13,180
When you find him for like three times, after you find him,
he'll be gone.

3418
02:26:13,480 --> 02:26:16,340
And after you find him for three times, he'll give you a
gift.

3419
02:26:16,760 --> 02:26:17,000
Oh!

3420
02:26:18,320 --> 02:26:20,000
Oh, that's that one guy.

3421
02:26:20,260 --> 02:26:20,620
Yeah!

3422
02:26:20,740 --> 02:26:20,920
Yeah.

3423
02:26:21,160 --> 02:26:21,900
Was it his name?

3424
02:26:21,940 --> 02:26:23,100
It was Russell or something?

3425
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:24,360
Oh, there he is!

3426
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:25,300
Oh!

3427
02:26:25,320 --> 02:26:26,480
Oh, he's escaping!

3428
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:27,760
He's climbing up!

3429
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:29,080
No, sir!

3430
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:31,640
Oh, sir!

3431
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:32,760
Okay, okay, he's gone again.

3432
02:26:32,840 --> 02:26:33,440
We gotta go find him.

3433
02:26:34,300 --> 02:26:35,740
But that was the third time!

3434
02:26:37,660 --> 02:26:39,180
Sir, sir, or fourth?

3435
02:26:39,260 --> 02:26:41,940
I forgot, but you have to find him for multiple times.

3436
02:26:42,040 --> 02:26:42,360
Okay.

3437
02:26:42,960 --> 02:26:45,120
You'll hear him before- Oh, I see him, I see him!

3438
02:26:45,440 --> 02:26:46,160
Oh, do you do?

3439
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:46,640
Right here.

3440
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:47,020
Wow!

3441
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:47,860
Oh!

3442
02:26:49,960 --> 02:26:50,600
He gave?

3443
02:26:50,860 --> 02:26:51,040
Oh!

3444
02:26:51,480 --> 02:26:51,880
Something.

3445
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:53,200
There you go, there you go.

3446
02:26:53,360 --> 02:26:54,040
What was it?

3447
02:26:55,760 --> 02:26:57,320
Take it, take it.

3448
02:26:57,400 --> 02:26:57,900
A bundle.

3449
02:26:59,780 --> 02:27:00,120
Oh!

3450
02:27:00,440 --> 02:27:04,640
Oh, there's a gold blocks in it.

3451
02:27:06,320 --> 02:27:07,120
Where did I go?

3452
02:27:08,180 --> 02:27:08,320
Oh.

3453
02:27:08,780 --> 02:27:09,160
Oh.

3454
02:27:09,540 --> 02:27:09,660
Oh.

3455
02:27:09,720 --> 02:27:10,300
I need this one.

3456
02:27:10,700 --> 02:27:12,020
Do you want your potatoes back?

3457
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:12,760
Oh, is it your magnet, Henya?

3458
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:13,600
No, no, it's okay.

3459
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:14,700
I have a lot of potato.

3460
02:27:15,180 --> 02:27:15,500
Okay.

3461
02:27:15,660 --> 02:27:16,420
Thank you.

3462
02:27:17,020 --> 02:27:18,940
Oh, I'm going to put the mailbox.

3463
02:27:19,180 --> 02:27:20,260
Wait, how do I put the mailbox?

3464
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:21,440
Oh, there we go.

3465
02:27:21,900 --> 02:27:22,380
Hmm.

3466
02:27:24,700 --> 02:27:25,180
Nice.

3467
02:27:26,580 --> 02:27:27,100
Cool!

3468
02:27:28,680 --> 02:27:29,200
Yeah!

3469
02:27:29,640 --> 02:27:32,300
What a cool guy.

3470
02:27:33,980 --> 02:27:35,920
Hard to combat roll forward.

3471
02:27:36,100 --> 02:27:37,180
Yeah, he just kind of shows up randomly.

3472
02:27:37,320 --> 02:27:40,120
He really likes Mata's dirt household.

3473
02:27:40,620 --> 02:27:42,020
Oh wait, I heard about that.

3474
02:27:42,320 --> 02:27:43,860
Yeah, he shows up there a lot.

3475
02:27:44,120 --> 02:27:44,980
Oh, really?

3476
02:27:45,420 --> 02:27:45,840
Yeah.

3477
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:47,740
I wonder why.

3478
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:50,680
I wonder why.

3479
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:52,920
Mata, you have someone living in your house.

3480
02:27:53,100 --> 02:27:54,360
Oh my gosh, she scared me.

3481
02:27:54,380 --> 02:27:55,300
Yeah, someone taking over.

3482
02:27:55,320 --> 02:27:56,600
over your house, Mata.

3483
02:27:56,820 --> 02:27:57,180
Yeah.

3484
02:27:59,260 --> 02:28:00,740
Should come back and claim it.

3485
02:28:01,540 --> 02:28:02,400
How do we get out of here?

3486
02:28:03,320 --> 02:28:04,040
Oh, wait, they're here.

3487
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:04,440
Oh, we go up here.

3488
02:28:04,620 --> 02:28:04,920
That's right.

3489
02:28:08,180 --> 02:28:08,540
Yeah.

3490
02:28:09,240 --> 02:28:10,340
Oh, I can't see.

3491
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:13,640
Oh, I don't know how I'm climbing.

3492
02:28:13,960 --> 02:28:15,820
I don't know how I'm climbing, but I'm climbing.

3493
02:28:16,240 --> 02:28:17,480
I don't know how this is happening.

3494
02:28:17,980 --> 02:28:18,240
Oh, God.

3495
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:20,560
Oh, there we go.

3496
02:28:21,360 --> 02:28:22,620
I don't know how that happened.

3497
02:28:22,760 --> 02:28:23,560
Careful, careful.

3498
02:28:24,760 --> 02:28:24,960
Oh.

3499
02:28:25,320 --> 02:28:26,780
Are you okay?

3500
02:28:27,300 --> 02:28:28,180
Did Henya just fall?

3501
02:28:30,580 --> 02:28:31,540
What a thrill.

3502
02:28:31,540 --> 02:28:32,480
I think Henya just fell.

3503
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:35,300
Has Henya met Henya Junior yet?

3504
02:28:35,420 --> 02:28:36,760
Wait, what is Henya Junior?

3505
02:28:37,560 --> 02:28:38,220
Henya Junior.

3506
02:28:39,260 --> 02:28:41,040
What is a Henya Junior dial?

3507
02:28:41,860 --> 02:28:42,680
What is that?

3508
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:46,120
What?

3509
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:47,240
I have a Henya Junior?

3510
02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:48,160
What?

3511
02:28:48,180 --> 02:28:49,780
Would you like your corpses back, Mint?

3512
02:28:50,940 --> 02:28:52,660
Yeah, I think I missed them.

3513
02:28:55,580 --> 02:28:56,820
He needs your corpses back.

3514
02:28:57,560 --> 02:28:59,580
I can do it for you.

3515
02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:00,280
Thank you.

3516
02:29:00,320 --> 02:29:00,400
Oh.

3517
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,880
I think you like them more than I do.

3518
02:29:06,580 --> 02:29:07,480
Here, I'll stand really close.

3519
02:29:08,740 --> 02:29:13,140
I think you...

3520
02:29:13,140 --> 02:29:13,540
Here you go.

3521
02:29:14,780 --> 02:29:15,200
Oh.

3522
02:29:16,100 --> 02:29:17,080
Thank you!

3523
02:29:17,900 --> 02:29:20,060
Something must be sacrificed.

3524
02:29:20,380 --> 02:29:21,700
I'll sacrifice this dagger.

3525
02:29:22,700 --> 02:29:22,840
Oh.

3526
02:29:23,300 --> 02:29:24,320
Oh, you know what?

02:29:24,320 --> 02:29:27,220
You have a trash can at the bottom.

3528
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:29,580
So if you put your item, you don't need it.

Everybody's leaving!

3535

What's happening?

3536
02:30:25,240 --> 02:30:26,820
Is there a bee in here?

3537
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:28,120
Oh, it's a bee lamp!

3538
02:30:28,260 --> 02:30:29,020
That's so cute!

3539
02:30:30,480 --> 02:30:30,900
Yeah!

3540
02:30:31,360 --> 02:30:33,380
I can make you one if you want to.

3541
02:30:33,720 --> 02:30:35,440
But the...

3542
02:30:37,920 --> 02:30:42,500
So, sometimes you might will get some item you don't know
how to use it.

3543
02:30:42,940 --> 02:30:43,500
Yeah.

3544
02:30:44,600 --> 02:30:47,440
And then when you go to the...

3545
02:30:47,440 --> 02:30:51,460
I'm also like pointing at the item you don't know how to use
it and press U.

3546
02:30:51,980 --> 02:30:54,440
It'll show you the recipe and what can you do with it.

3547
02:30:55,300 --> 02:30:55,740
Oh really?

3548
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:56,760
Wait you press what?

3549
02:30:57,800 --> 02:30:58,080
U.

3550
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:00,120
U.

3551
02:31:02,440 --> 02:31:02,580
U.

3552
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:03,300
U.

3553
02:31:04,920 --> 02:31:05,480
Yeah!

3554
02:31:06,460 --> 02:31:07,020
Whoa.

3555
02:31:07,220 --> 02:31:07,580
U.

3556
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:08,320
You.

3557
02:31:08,560 --> 02:31:09,120
Whoa!

3558
02:31:11,360 --> 02:31:13,400
So you can see it with U.

3559
02:31:13,800 --> 02:31:15,060
Oh my god.

3560
02:31:18,800 --> 02:31:19,320
What?

3561
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:24,260
Oh my god, there's so much!

3562
02:31:25,640 --> 02:31:27,960
There is, there is!

3563
02:31:30,420 --> 02:31:32,180
Ooh, witch's house.

3564
02:31:33,360 --> 02:31:34,560
This is so cute!

3565
02:31:35,020 --> 02:31:35,860
It is!

3566
02:31:36,400 --> 02:31:38,420
Oh, do you want to go to N-City?

3567
02:31:38,680 --> 02:31:42,240
You want to touch like a waystone so you can go back anytime
you want?

3568
02:31:42,420 --> 02:31:43,080
Oh, sure!

3569
02:31:44,620 --> 02:31:45,140
Okay.

3570
02:31:45,360 --> 02:31:46,020
There we go.

3571
02:31:49,020 --> 02:31:49,680
Oh,

3572
02:31:55,120 --> 02:31:57,040
she left us, everybody.

3573
02:31:58,940 --> 02:32:02,580
Now, we're just out here.

3574
02:32:03,340 --> 02:32:05,320
And then, oh, gloomy bear.

3575
02:32:07,500 --> 02:32:09,720
There's a big old gloomy bear.

3576
02:32:11,540 --> 02:32:13,060
There's this house over here.

3577
02:32:13,100 --> 02:32:14,240
Oh, there's a way to stone here.

3578
02:32:15,600 --> 02:32:17,360
This is the kitten hole.

3579
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:24,000
This...

3580
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:25,720
She hates us.

3581
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:27,500
She hates us!

3582
02:32:28,860 --> 02:32:29,000
What?

3583
02:32:29,420 --> 02:32:29,640
Huh?

3584
02:32:34,300 --> 02:32:34,680
Oh!

3585
02:32:34,980 --> 02:32:35,120
Huh?

3586
02:32:36,080 --> 02:32:36,540
What?

3587
02:32:37,060 --> 02:32:37,500
What?

3588
02:32:37,580 --> 02:32:38,340
Who hates you!

3589
02:32:38,340 --> 02:32:40,680
No, no, oh, oh, oh, no,

3590
02:32:46,600 --> 02:32:54,500

no But it's a different.

3594
02:33:12,160 --> 02:33:13,140
Let's see.

3595
02:33:14,340 --> 02:33:14,900
Anything.

3596
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:15,700
Oh, wait.

3597
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:16,880
There's trees in here.

3598
02:33:20,760 --> 02:33:21,460
There's trees.

3599
02:33:22,980 --> 02:33:24,100
And Midlands.

3600
02:33:24,780 --> 02:33:25,400
What's this?

3601
02:33:26,380 --> 02:33:27,940
This is a special kind of tree.

3602
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:29,500
Prem log.

3603
02:33:29,660 --> 02:33:30,060
Oh, no.

3604
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:31,800
Everybody keeps crashing.

3605
02:33:32,060 --> 02:33:32,540
Is it me?

3606
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:33,980
Am I the problem?

3607
02:33:34,660 --> 02:33:35,540
Hi, y'all.

3608
02:33:35,920 --> 02:33:36,680
Welcome back.

3609
02:33:36,780 --> 02:33:38,020
Did it crash for you too?

3610
02:33:40,860 --> 02:33:42,880
Oh, why are we in the end?

3611
02:33:43,740 --> 02:33:47,000
Oh, because I thought she was my favorite Elitra.

3612
02:33:47,820 --> 02:33:47,920
Oh.

3613
02:33:48,440 --> 02:33:48,960
So much happened.

3614
02:33:49,380 --> 02:33:49,420
Ah!

3615
02:33:49,820 --> 02:33:50,440
It fired me!

3616
02:33:52,920 --> 02:33:54,100
What's wrong with him?

3617
02:33:54,160 --> 02:33:55,180
Why is he among us?

3618
02:34:03,420 --> 02:34:03,880
Man.

3619
02:34:04,780 --> 02:34:10,000
So I think, I think the problem is, is Zen's house, because
I crashed too when I went near Zen's house.

3620
02:34:10,620 --> 02:34:10,920
Oh.

3621
02:34:11,960 --> 02:34:12,200
Yeah.

3622
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:12,880
Wait, really?

3623
02:34:13,180 --> 02:34:14,960
We went with no problems though.

3624
02:34:15,560 --> 02:34:20,640
Yeah, the first time I went was no problems, but then when I
went again, what happened to the armor I gave you?

3625
02:34:20,760 --> 02:34:22,760
It broke because everybody kills me every five seconds.

3626
02:34:24,760 --> 02:34:25,120
No!

3627
02:34:25,560 --> 02:34:28,700
I have no more armor because everything, everything breaks.

3628
02:34:29,380 --> 02:34:29,640
No!

3629
02:34:32,420 --> 02:34:34,380
Sad that you have no armor.

3630
02:34:34,420 --> 02:34:36,080
Everybody kills me every five seconds.

3631
02:34:40,660 --> 02:34:45,240
I'm trying to not make eye contact with any of these
enemies, but because I know I shouldn't look at them, I want

3632
02:34:45,240 --> 02:34:45,360
to look at them.

3633
02:34:45,380 --> 02:34:46,160
I know.

3634
02:34:46,260 --> 02:34:47,380
Oh wait, hold on.

3635
02:34:47,500 --> 02:34:50,500
This is not the end zone that I was trying to take her with.

3636
02:34:50,960 --> 02:34:51,480
Hold on.

3637
02:34:51,500 --> 02:34:51,960
Oh, it's different?

3638
02:34:57,720 --> 02:34:58,460
Where's she go?

3639
02:34:58,980 --> 02:34:59,840
Oh, that guy...

3640
02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:00,300
I don't know.

3641
02:35:00,920 --> 02:35:01,660
That guy, why is...

3642
02:35:01,660 --> 02:35:01,820
I'm gone.

3643
02:35:01,940 --> 02:35:02,620
She left us.

3644
02:35:03,160 --> 02:35:06,300
There's like some weird endermans that look like among us.

3645
02:35:08,520 --> 02:35:08,920
What?

3646
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:10,720
That guy right there.

3647
02:35:11,600 --> 02:35:11,860
Oh!

3648
02:35:11,940 --> 02:35:12,840
Oh yeah, he just...

3649
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:13,660
He attacks on...

3650
02:35:13,660 --> 02:35:14,540
Like, he doesn't...

3651
02:35:14,540 --> 02:35:16,820
You don't need to look at him for him to attack if he just
sees you.

3652
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:17,440
He'll attack you.

3653
02:35:17,740 --> 02:35:17,820
Oh!

3654
02:35:19,580 --> 02:35:21,120
Oh, I think we should go.

3655
02:35:21,660 --> 02:35:23,680
Oh, oh, thank you.

3656
02:35:24,080 --> 02:35:27,920
So if you ever want to go to the Duffy Ender Dragon and
stuff, it's right here.

3657
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:31,460
Oh, oh, that's an annoying thing.

3658
02:35:33,260 --> 02:35:34,180
Not friend.

3659
02:35:34,400 --> 02:35:35,140
Where's the...

3660
02:35:35,140 --> 02:35:35,480
Not friend.

3661
02:35:36,040 --> 02:35:36,520
Where's...

3662
02:35:36,520 --> 02:35:37,320
Oh, Hania!

3663
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:38,980
Oh, Hania!

3664
02:35:39,620 --> 02:35:39,700
Hania!

3665
02:35:39,700 --> 02:35:40,600
Hold on, come here, Hania.

3666
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:42,060
Hania, jump, Hania.

3667
02:35:42,220 --> 02:35:42,640
Oh, no.

3668
02:35:42,900 --> 02:35:43,120
Oh, no.

3669
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:43,440
Oh, no.

3670
02:35:44,020 --> 02:35:46,040
Uh, how do I pick you guys up?

3671
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:46,740
Uh, help!

3672
02:35:50,020 --> 02:35:50,740
Good luck!

3673
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:51,220
Good luck!

3674
02:35:51,220 --> 02:35:51,600
Good luck!

3675
02:35:52,320 --> 02:35:52,680
Oh,

3676
02:35:57,240 --> 02:35:57,500
there you go.

3677
02:35:57,840 --> 02:35:58,260
Yeah, you're on my head.

3678
02:35:59,260 --> 02:35:59,960
You're on my head now.

3679
02:36:00,880 --> 02:36:02,040
How do I get Henny off my head?

3680
02:36:02,840 --> 02:36:04,160
Wait, I'm not.

3681
02:36:04,920 --> 02:36:05,960
You're on my head for me.

3682
02:36:06,020 --> 02:36:07,140
It's okay, I'll just keep you on my head.

3683
02:36:07,220 --> 02:36:08,860
Wait, I don't see you on her head either.

3684
02:36:09,800 --> 02:36:10,920
Yeah, I'm not.

3685
02:36:11,560 --> 02:36:12,740
You are for me.

3686
02:36:12,920 --> 02:36:13,280
What?

3687
02:36:14,680 --> 02:36:16,600
It's okay, I'll just have a pet.

3688
02:36:16,760 --> 02:36:18,740
The server's having a little bit of trouble, I think.

3689
02:36:18,760 --> 02:36:20,940
Yeah, it's a little laggy today.

3690
02:36:21,060 --> 02:36:23,440
Wait, is there a waste stone here or?

3691
02:36:24,380 --> 02:36:25,500
Oh, this way, this way.

3692
02:36:25,620 --> 02:36:26,100
This way?

3693
02:36:26,740 --> 02:36:27,880
I don't know where this one is.

3694
02:36:28,020 --> 02:36:28,540
Right here.

3695
02:36:28,540 --> 02:36:29,680
And you're still on my head.

3696
02:36:29,900 --> 02:36:29,980
Oh!

3697
02:36:31,500 --> 02:36:31,940
Wait, where?

3698
02:36:32,220 --> 02:36:33,600
Oh, right here, right here.

3699
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:34,760
Oh, I see it.

3700
02:36:34,780 --> 02:36:35,760
It blended in.

3701
02:36:35,800 --> 02:36:36,160
Nice.

3702
02:36:37,180 --> 02:36:38,240
And portal dial.

3703
02:36:38,680 --> 02:36:40,500
Whoa, it's so cool in here too.

3704
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:45,420
Yeah, but it looks a lot different as well.

3705
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:46,920
Yeah, it looks so different.

3706
02:36:47,620 --> 02:36:47,920
Oh, I...

3707
02:36:49,660 --> 02:36:50,420
Monster Hunter.

3708
02:36:50,420 --> 02:36:51,100
I can't.

3709
02:36:51,420 --> 02:36:52,180
Mon-Han, Mon-Han.

3710
02:36:52,520 --> 02:36:53,220
Mon-Han, Mon-Han.

3711
02:36:54,420 --> 02:36:55,020
Mon-Han.

3712
02:36:55,020 --> 02:36:55,300
Mon-Han.

3713
02:36:56,220 --> 02:36:57,360
Wait, you play Mo-Han?

3714
02:36:58,100 --> 02:37:02,620
No, but right now, actually, there's a sale on a bunch of
Mon-Han games.

3715
02:37:03,020 --> 02:37:03,660
I want to get them.

3716
02:37:03,700 --> 02:37:08,040
I'm playing World right now, so if you ever want to play it
with me, I'm always available.

3717
02:37:08,380 --> 02:37:09,240
Okay, that fixed it.

3718
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:09,980
That fixed it.

3719
02:37:10,480 --> 02:37:10,920
You got it?

3720
02:37:10,920 --> 02:37:11,800
Oh, welcome back, Adi.

3721
02:37:11,960 --> 02:37:15,000
Yeah, yeah, I logged out and logged back in so I could fix
it.

3722
02:37:15,360 --> 02:37:16,520
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

3723
02:37:17,660 --> 02:37:18,040
Mermaid.

3724
02:37:19,580 --> 02:37:20,840
Oh yeah!

3725
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:21,540
Wait!

3726
02:37:21,860 --> 02:37:23,460
These are like rainbow candles.

3727
02:37:24,300 --> 02:37:24,880
They're cute!

3728
02:37:25,240 --> 02:37:26,060
They're really cute!

3729
02:37:26,660 --> 02:37:27,500
It is pretty!

3730
02:37:27,860 --> 02:37:28,080
Yeah.

3731
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:31,380
I want to steal them.

3732
02:37:32,340 --> 02:37:33,300
Do it.

3733
02:37:33,740 --> 02:37:35,300
Steal it.

3734
02:37:35,800 --> 02:37:38,620
No one can stop me.

3735
02:37:39,080 --> 02:37:39,260
Oh!

3736
02:37:40,440 --> 02:37:40,800
There's a lot.

3737
02:37:40,800 --> 02:37:42,480
There's a lot of places to explore.

3738
02:37:42,880 --> 02:37:44,680
If you ever want to, you can.

3739
02:37:45,580 --> 02:37:46,000
Named.

3740
02:37:46,140 --> 02:37:47,280
So many name tags.

3741
02:37:47,500 --> 02:37:47,780
Whoa!

3742
02:37:48,900 --> 02:37:49,300
Yeah!

3743
02:37:50,260 --> 02:37:50,580
Wow.

3744
02:37:52,820 --> 02:37:53,600
I'm out of space.

3745
02:37:53,600 --> 02:37:55,740
I think we should get the good backpack for you.

3746
02:37:56,320 --> 02:37:57,140
I'm gonna get it.

3747
02:37:57,320 --> 02:37:58,180
I'm gonna get it.

3748
02:37:58,300 --> 02:37:58,820
It's okay.

3749
02:37:59,720 --> 02:38:00,800
Mouse can help you?

3750
02:38:01,260 --> 02:38:01,960
For a prize.

3751
02:38:02,080 --> 02:38:03,220
For a prize.

3752
02:38:04,160 --> 02:38:04,920
I can get her.

3753
02:38:05,060 --> 02:38:05,700
I can get her.

3754
02:38:05,820 --> 02:38:06,160
It's okay.

3755
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:07,440
I don't really care about my soul.

3756
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:09,800
Hold on.

3757
02:38:10,340 --> 02:38:11,200
Do I have it?

3758
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:12,000
Do I have it?

3759
02:38:13,200 --> 02:38:13,960
Do they stack?

3760
02:38:14,400 --> 02:38:14,800
This...

3761
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:18,360
Man, where was the Henya Lone Shark hospitality for me, huh?

3762
02:38:18,760 --> 02:38:20,180
What do you mean, Daya?

3763
02:38:20,340 --> 02:38:20,820
What do you mean?

3764
02:38:22,100 --> 02:38:23,740
I'm a generous, Daya.

3765
02:38:25,380 --> 02:38:27,940
Anya, you've been an amazing tour guide.

3766
02:38:28,140 --> 02:38:29,600
You've been so nice.

3767
02:38:30,160 --> 02:38:30,880
So everything.

3768
02:38:32,300 --> 02:38:32,680
Yeah.

3769
02:38:33,460 --> 02:38:34,380
You stole my candles.

3770
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:37,660
Anya?

3771
02:38:38,240 --> 02:38:38,560
No!

3772
02:38:38,960 --> 02:38:39,960
See, this is what I mean!

3773
02:38:40,380 --> 02:38:41,300
She's over here!

3774
02:38:43,100 --> 02:38:45,140
Everything comes with a price, Adi.

3775
02:38:46,180 --> 02:38:46,400
Yep.

3776
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:47,940
Nothing is free, Daya.

3777
02:38:48,060 --> 02:38:48,740
Nothing is free.

3778
02:38:48,760 --> 02:38:49,040
you.

3779
02:38:49,980 --> 02:38:54,540
It's okay, Hanya, if you need a henchman for your business,
I'm here for you.

3780
02:38:54,700 --> 02:38:56,320
Thank you, did my business.

3781
02:38:56,960 --> 02:38:59,160
Hanya, I built a watermelon for you.

3782
02:39:00,900 --> 02:39:02,040
That is true.

3783
02:39:02,140 --> 02:39:04,140
It took you seven hours, he said.

3784
02:39:04,220 --> 02:39:05,520
It took me seven hours.

3785
02:39:07,300 --> 02:39:07,600
No way.

3786
02:39:08,060 --> 02:39:09,340
Oh, wait, have you shown her?

3787
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:11,520
Oh, yeah, I did.

3788
02:39:11,640 --> 02:39:13,220
Remember the Colonel's plays watermelon?

3789
02:39:13,260 --> 02:39:14,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3790
02:39:14,740 --> 02:39:15,500
That's the watermelon.

3791
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:16,720
Oh, my God.

3792
02:39:18,260 --> 02:39:18,740
It's a watermelon.

3793

Okay, I need to see the Henya Junior.

3797
02:39:56,820 --> 02:40:00,080
When the heck did I get the Henya Junior, Deo?

Let's see.

3801
02:40:11,160 --> 02:40:15,200
She stole the dirt from my chest, so I gave her the wall of
dirt.

3802
02:40:15,400 --> 02:40:18,780
You need a square dirt over there, I gave her a wall of
dirt.

3803
02:40:18,860 --> 02:40:20,280
Oh, I see it!

Wow.

I and I and Mouth did it together.

3809
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:31,120
Her place is so fun.

3810
02:40:33,060 --> 02:40:34,800
When you go down here...

3811
02:40:34,800 --> 02:40:35,320
This way, this way.

3812
02:40:35,720 --> 02:40:36,480
This way, this way, this way.

3813
02:40:36,480 --> 02:40:37,040
This way, okay.

3814
02:40:39,800 --> 02:40:40,640
There's a...

3815
02:40:42,120 --> 02:40:42,980
There's a toilet.

3816
02:40:43,620 --> 02:40:44,440
But you can go in.

3817
02:40:46,840 --> 02:40:47,260
Oh.

3818
02:40:48,900 --> 02:40:50,740
But they're revving up to use the toilet.

3819
02:40:50,840 --> 02:40:51,880
Is that what's going?

3820
02:40:52,120 --> 02:40:53,900
Yeah, I'm wrapping up to use the toilet.

3821
02:40:57,080 --> 02:40:58,080
It's okay, I get it.

3822
02:40:58,120 --> 02:41:02,140
We all have a little bit of something to get rid of, get out
of there, you know?

3823
02:41:02,200 --> 02:41:03,880
Why is the gun run on the ceiling?

3824
02:41:04,920 --> 02:41:05,220
Oh.

3825
02:41:06,820 --> 02:41:08,540
Yeah, there's a gun on the ceiling.

3826
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:09,540
Can you see it?

3827
02:41:09,580 --> 02:41:10,820
Yeah, I see him.

3828
02:41:12,300 --> 02:41:12,420
Oh!

3829
02:41:14,340 --> 02:41:15,220
It's the Hanya.

3830
02:41:15,880 --> 02:41:17,300
Hanya, you had one job.

3831
02:41:17,880 --> 02:41:19,440
No, no, it's not me.

3832
02:41:19,520 --> 02:41:20,600
I think emoji did it.

3833
02:41:20,840 --> 02:41:21,700
Mochi did it.

3834
02:41:21,860 --> 02:41:22,440
I wonder.

3835
02:41:25,840 --> 02:41:28,040
Did you just say dang it?

3836
02:41:28,360 --> 02:41:29,620
What did I hear from you?

3837
02:41:29,700 --> 02:41:30,620
No, no, no, no.

3838
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:32,360
I think Mochi is somewhere.

3839
02:41:32,840 --> 02:41:33,640
Well, yeah, yeah.

3840
02:41:33,940 --> 02:41:35,720
Do you think she's like maybe she's invisible?

3841
02:41:35,940 --> 02:41:36,740
She pulled the lever?

3842
02:41:37,580 --> 02:41:38,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3843
02:41:38,560 --> 02:41:39,660
I'm pretty sure she did it.

3844
02:41:39,800 --> 02:41:40,840
I'm pretty sure she's the one who did it.

3845
02:41:40,860 --> 02:41:42,000
I don't see her on the server.

3846
02:41:43,840 --> 02:41:44,520
I don't see her.

3847
02:41:44,640 --> 02:41:44,860
Oh, hold on.

3848
02:41:44,860 --> 02:41:46,320
I think one is so cute though.

3849
02:41:49,060 --> 02:41:50,160
They have legs?

3850
02:41:56,030 --> 02:41:57,710
What else is in here?

3851
02:41:58,970 --> 02:42:03,330
I don't know, her place is like a lot of, you can go a lot
of places.

3852
02:42:04,330 --> 02:42:08,930
I like the fish tanks.

3853
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:15,240
Oh!

3854
02:42:16,300 --> 02:42:18,340
I thought this was a person.

3855
02:42:20,280 --> 02:42:20,520
Oh!

3856
02:42:22,960 --> 02:42:23,120
Oh!

3857
02:42:23,880 --> 02:42:25,600
She has security cameras and everything!

3858
02:42:26,420 --> 02:42:26,720
Yeah!

3859
02:42:26,860 --> 02:42:27,280
Yeah!

3860
02:42:27,420 --> 02:42:29,080
I'm gonna give her something.

3861
02:42:29,280 --> 02:42:31,540
A lot of security camera over here.

3862
02:42:31,600 --> 02:42:32,020
Yeah.

3863
02:42:33,340 --> 02:42:34,240
How should I give her?

3864
02:42:36,100 --> 02:42:37,020
No, I want my room.

3865
02:42:37,360 --> 02:42:37,900
You know what?

3866
02:42:37,960 --> 02:42:38,700
I'll keep everything.

3867
02:42:39,240 --> 02:42:40,900
Ew, they walk.

3868
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:42,100
That's a hair brine again!

3869
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:44,100
Why there's a hair brine everywhere?

3870
02:42:44,720 --> 02:42:45,420
Up there too!

3871
02:42:45,900 --> 02:42:46,140
Oh my gosh!

3872
02:42:46,260 --> 02:42:47,340
You've had another one?

3873
02:42:47,480 --> 02:42:47,600
That's terrifying!

3874
02:42:48,440 --> 02:42:49,840
I found another one right there!

3875
02:42:49,840 --> 02:42:51,600
I've been jump scared by so many of those.

3876
02:42:52,080 --> 02:42:53,560
There's so many of them!

3877
02:42:53,620 --> 02:42:54,660
Oh, I see it right there!

3878
02:42:54,740 --> 02:42:55,480
Oh my gosh, it's kind of...

3879
02:42:55,480 --> 02:42:56,940
It's really realistic looking.

3880
02:42:57,420 --> 02:42:58,620
It's in here too!

3881
02:42:58,700 --> 02:42:59,440
Do you see him?

3882
02:42:59,760 --> 02:43:01,000
Oh my god.

3883
02:43:01,320 --> 02:43:01,560
Where?

3884
02:43:02,900 --> 02:43:03,520
Right here.

3885
02:43:04,840 --> 02:43:06,020
Over here, right?

3886
02:43:06,720 --> 02:43:07,660
Right here, right here.

3887
02:43:09,380 --> 02:43:10,600
No, no, no, right here.

3888
02:43:10,820 --> 02:43:11,580
Right here.

3889
02:43:12,020 --> 02:43:15,900
I look that way.

3890
02:43:16,260 --> 02:43:17,020
I see him.

3891
02:43:17,440 --> 02:43:19,520
Right in the... on the wall, right?

3892
02:43:20,460 --> 02:43:21,040
Uh...

3893
02:43:21,040 --> 02:43:23,860
I think you're looking at a different direction.

3894
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:25,760
There's more...

3895
02:43:25,760 --> 02:43:26,140
Oh!

3896
02:43:26,620 --> 02:43:27,400
Oh my god!

3897
02:43:27,420 --> 02:43:29,420
Oh my god, I see him!

3898
02:43:30,860 --> 02:43:30,980
Whoa!

3899
02:43:31,460 --> 02:43:35,380
Scary though.

3900
02:43:36,360 --> 02:43:37,280
Scary though.

3901
02:43:37,680 --> 02:43:39,740
Why you can't see in here?

3902
02:43:42,720 --> 02:43:45,940
I think this is her mining area, I think?

3903
02:43:46,040 --> 02:43:46,320
I don't know.

3904
02:43:46,680 --> 02:43:47,740
Maybe, yeah.

3905
02:43:50,840 --> 02:43:51,360
Hmm.

3906
02:43:53,620 --> 02:43:55,500
Can't see how anywhere in here.

3907
02:43:57,460 --> 02:43:58,780
Everything is...

3908
02:43:59,740 --> 02:44:01,840
Oh, I'm lost.

3909
02:44:02,660 --> 02:44:03,220
Oh, water.

3910
02:44:07,220 --> 02:44:09,080
I'm just going to drop down.

3911
02:44:10,220 --> 02:44:11,000
Oh, never mind.

3912
02:44:12,560 --> 02:44:13,940
Oh, oh, it's all...

3913
02:44:13,940 --> 02:44:15,660
Oh, she has a limpet too.

3914
02:44:15,780 --> 02:44:17,400
Oh, yeah, she has a limpet too.

3915
02:44:18,400 --> 02:44:19,480
It's a quest.

3916
02:44:23,180 --> 02:44:23,920
What's this?

3917
02:44:26,580 --> 02:44:28,060
She got a lot of stuff.

3918
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:29,980
Yeah, fish tank.

3919
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,240
Wait, I don't see Henia Jr. Where is that?

3920
02:44:33,280 --> 02:44:33,920
Prismarite.

3921
02:44:37,500 --> 02:44:39,880
Yeah, where's Henia Jr.?

3922
02:44:39,880 --> 02:44:40,860
Wait!

3923
02:44:42,820 --> 02:44:43,920
Four skins?

3924
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:47,200
Four skins skin.

3925
02:44:48,480 --> 02:44:49,760
Henia Jr.?

3926
02:44:50,360 --> 02:44:54,900
Four skin Jr. So many, so many.

3927
02:44:56,400 --> 02:44:57,620
There's just so many.

3928
02:44:58,880 --> 02:45:00,880
And she got Mei-chan over here.

3929
02:45:03,640 --> 02:45:04,020
Okay.

3930
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,940
Why are there so much- She got the hidden junior at the
dome?

3931
02:45:08,220 --> 02:45:08,660
Is this it?

3932
02:45:09,820 --> 02:45:10,680
No, fourth.

3933
02:45:11,820 --> 02:45:12,500
This way.

3934
02:45:13,060 --> 02:45:15,000
Up here.

3935
02:45:15,320 --> 02:45:17,420
She got the beautiful dorm as well.

3936
02:45:18,300 --> 02:45:18,740
What is it?

3937
02:45:18,940 --> 02:45:20,040
No, not this way.

3938
02:45:21,980 --> 02:45:24,260
This is definitely a meechy place, yeah.

3939
02:45:25,580 --> 02:45:26,380
I think so too.

3940
02:45:28,880 --> 02:45:30,780
She also is a little man.

3941
02:45:30,800 --> 02:45:31,400
Wow!

3942
02:45:32,140 --> 02:45:32,500
Look at it!

3943
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:33,500
Oh my goodness!

3944
02:45:33,580 --> 02:45:35,120
This table is so good!

3945
02:45:37,220 --> 02:45:40,100
The axolotls are all so many different colors.

3946
02:45:40,860 --> 02:45:41,660
Who is that?

3947
02:45:42,400 --> 02:45:43,260
Who is that?

3948
02:45:43,660 --> 02:45:46,580
Who is that, you guys?

3949
02:45:46,760 --> 02:45:47,580
Who is that?

3950
02:45:50,260 --> 02:45:51,060
It's Kuro?

3951
02:45:52,160 --> 02:45:52,760
No!

3952
02:45:54,080 --> 02:45:55,140
It's mint!

3953
02:45:57,400 --> 02:45:57,500
It's mint!

3954
02:45:57,500 --> 02:45:58,080
It's Kuro!

3955
02:45:58,880 --> 02:45:59,260
What?

3956
02:46:03,630 --> 02:46:05,950
Wait, who's that?

3957
02:46:07,590 --> 02:46:09,530
Oh, what's gun run?

3958
02:46:11,310 --> 02:46:14,150
Oh my god, these are alive!

3959
02:46:14,630 --> 02:46:15,150
Oh my god.

3960
02:46:15,610 --> 02:46:18,690
Haruka Jr. Uh...

3961
02:46:18,690 --> 02:46:30,710
Adi Jr., Fruit Jr., Kuro Jr., Giga Jr., Matan Jr. Dusclamp
Jr. Iron Mouse Jr. Heavenly Jr. Sushi Jr. Joel Jr. Mm-hmm.

3962
02:46:30,730 --> 02:46:34,030
Is there... is there Hanya Jr. maybe in here?

3963
02:46:34,110 --> 02:46:35,090
Maybe in here?

3964
02:46:35,730 --> 02:46:37,770
Hanya Jr. Oh no, it's just Hanya!

3965
02:46:40,070 --> 02:46:42,510
Hanya Jr. Right here, right here.

3966
02:46:43,190 --> 02:46:44,450
Where's... where's my junior?

3967
02:46:46,570 --> 02:46:47,850
He's right...

3968
02:46:47,850 --> 02:46:48,290
here.

3969
02:46:48,770 --> 02:46:51,230
If you look...

3970
02:46:51,230 --> 02:46:51,830
Here, here, here.

3971
02:46:52,230 --> 02:46:53,130
Right there, right there.

3972
02:46:53,410 --> 02:46:59,830
Hanya Jr. Hanya Jr. Hanya Jr. Did I hear that?

3973
02:46:59,830 --> 02:47:00,350
So... Oh.

3974
02:47:00,730 --> 02:47:02,890
Oh, did you eat yourself?

3975
02:47:03,030 --> 02:47:04,490
No, no, of course not.

3976
02:47:04,590 --> 02:47:05,130
Of course not.

3977
02:47:05,170 --> 02:47:06,150
I will never.

3978
02:47:06,330 --> 02:47:06,670
No.

3979
02:47:07,590 --> 02:47:09,650
Oh, is that Jerma?

3980
02:47:10,490 --> 02:47:11,570
Gingerbread picnic.

3981
02:47:12,270 --> 02:47:13,210
Please don't eat it.

3982
02:47:13,310 --> 02:47:13,950
Is this Jerma?

3983
02:47:16,310 --> 02:47:18,150
You can eat them?

3984
02:47:19,830 --> 02:47:21,290
Thank goodness I didn't eat them.

3985
02:47:22,790 --> 02:47:23,990
That's Linus.

3986
02:47:24,430 --> 02:47:24,430
Oh.

3987
02:47:25,210 --> 02:47:26,730
They're in the picnic?

3988
02:47:26,870 --> 02:47:28,030
That's so cute.

3989
02:47:33,660 --> 02:47:34,620
Is Jerma...

3990
02:47:34,620 --> 02:47:35,440
At the other side?

3991
02:47:36,380 --> 02:47:36,860
What's this?

3992
02:47:37,900 --> 02:47:38,320
Jerma?

3993
02:47:40,320 --> 02:47:40,800
Jerma?

3994
02:47:41,140 --> 02:47:41,620
Jerma?

3995
02:47:41,620 --> 02:47:42,000
Jerma?

3996
02:47:42,660 --> 02:47:43,140
Jerma?

3997
02:47:43,140 --> 02:47:43,580
Jerma?

3998
02:47:43,880 --> 02:47:45,560
Yeah, I think he's on the wall.

3999
02:47:46,640 --> 02:47:47,100
Oh, really?

4000
02:47:47,360 --> 02:47:48,340
Yeah, right here.

4001
02:47:53,710 --> 02:47:55,310
Wait, that's a Jerma song?

4002
02:47:55,470 --> 02:47:56,250
I think so.

4003
02:47:56,950 --> 02:48:00,790
Oh, everybody talking about him, but I never know what does
he look like.

4004
02:48:00,870 --> 02:48:01,190
Yeah!

4005
02:48:01,270 --> 02:48:02,190
I see him?

4006
02:48:02,370 --> 02:48:03,290
Jerma song!

4007
02:48:03,350 --> 02:48:03,650
Jerma?

4008
02:48:07,130 --> 02:48:08,010
No, you know.

4009
02:48:08,170 --> 02:48:09,330
No, it's a different people.

4010
02:48:09,350 --> 02:48:14,850
What is this?

4011
02:48:16,690 --> 02:48:18,390
That's not Jerma.

4012
02:48:19,550 --> 02:48:24,110
I will never know what Jerma-san look like.

4013
02:48:25,090 --> 02:48:27,590
Maybe it's this one over here.

4014
02:48:28,110 --> 02:48:31,410
They say it's Kuro though.

4015
02:48:32,190 --> 02:48:33,910
Oh yeah, my chat told me that's Kuro.

4016
02:48:35,050 --> 02:48:35,970
It's his brother?

4017
02:48:36,370 --> 02:48:37,330
Wait, really?

4018
02:48:37,790 --> 02:48:39,470
Oh, he says brother?

4019
02:48:39,650 --> 02:48:40,430
That's wonderful.

4020
02:48:43,090 --> 02:48:44,250
He's so popular.

4021
02:48:45,450 --> 02:48:45,970
Nice.

4022
02:48:46,530 --> 02:48:47,210
Jiren Masan.

4023
02:48:47,430 --> 02:48:49,430
People keep talking about Jiren Masan.

4024
02:48:50,290 --> 02:48:51,490
One day I'll see him.

4025
02:48:51,570 --> 02:48:52,090
One day.

4026
02:48:53,650 --> 02:48:54,870
One day, one day.

4027
02:48:55,170 --> 02:48:56,030
He has a brother?

4028
02:48:56,210 --> 02:48:57,050
That's cool.

4029
02:48:59,510 --> 02:49:01,070
His gingerbread is so cute!

4030
02:49:02,090 --> 02:49:02,630
Yeah!

4031
02:49:04,130 --> 02:49:05,270
Oh, is this the room?

4032
02:49:05,430 --> 02:49:05,630
Oh.

4033
02:49:06,310 --> 02:49:07,090
Who is this?

4034
02:49:07,250 --> 02:49:07,750
It's a dog.

4035
02:49:08,970 --> 02:49:10,350
I love her kitchen.

4036
02:49:10,470 --> 02:49:11,390
That looks so cute.

4037
02:49:12,250 --> 02:49:14,250
This is kind of crazy.

4038
02:49:17,070 --> 02:49:19,410
It's kind of crazy.

4039
02:49:21,270 --> 02:49:21,510
Crazy.

4040
02:49:21,690 --> 02:49:22,990
I like it.

4041
02:49:26,430 --> 02:49:26,830
Wow.

4042
02:49:32,220 --> 02:49:33,420
Are you okay?

4043
02:49:33,560 --> 02:49:33,920
What the heck?

4044
02:49:34,460 --> 02:49:34,940
Oh!

4045
02:49:35,700 --> 02:49:36,180
Oh.

4046
02:49:37,040 --> 02:49:40,180
Why did so many guns come here?

4047
02:49:40,200 --> 02:49:41,640
I think she's obsessed.

4048
02:49:42,560 --> 02:49:44,400
I think so.

4049
02:49:44,620 --> 02:49:44,900
I think so.

4050
02:49:46,520 --> 02:49:47,420
See you, hello.

4051
02:49:47,580 --> 02:49:48,360
Hi, Bousa.

4052
02:49:49,160 --> 02:49:50,080
Hi, Bousa.

4053
02:49:50,460 --> 02:49:52,600
No, she keeps the fox in a cage.

4054
02:49:52,760 --> 02:49:53,680
What is this?

4055
02:49:54,500 --> 02:49:55,040
The turtle?

4056
02:49:56,500 --> 02:49:57,080
I don't know.

4057
02:49:57,220 --> 02:49:57,740
What is that?

4058
02:49:58,620 --> 02:49:59,120
What is that?

4059
02:49:59,140 --> 02:50:00,040
I don't think he's a turtle.

4060
02:50:00,420 --> 02:50:00,940
A dinosaur?

4061
02:50:02,680 --> 02:50:03,920
A little dinosaur?

4062
02:50:04,220 --> 02:50:05,340
Little baby dinosaur.

4063
02:50:06,240 --> 02:50:08,980
A little baby dinosaur trapped in here, do you?

4064
02:50:09,920 --> 02:50:10,860
So sad.

4065
02:50:11,020 --> 02:50:11,620
That's abuse.

4066
02:50:12,960 --> 02:50:14,320
I'm reporting her.

4067
02:50:14,920 --> 02:50:16,440
Oh, and a smoking bird.

4068
02:50:17,480 --> 02:50:19,620
Yeah, she got the smoking bird.

4069
02:50:19,900 --> 02:50:20,400
What?

4070
02:50:21,160 --> 02:50:21,860
It's not good for you.

4071
02:50:22,060 --> 02:50:22,760
Don't smoke.

4072
02:50:23,440 --> 02:50:24,820
That's why Robin is dying.

4073
02:50:24,980 --> 02:50:25,720
Stop smoking.

4074
02:50:26,220 --> 02:50:26,300
Yeah.

4075
02:50:26,800 --> 02:50:27,460
Stop smoking.

4076
02:50:28,300 --> 02:50:29,720
Stop dying smoking.

4077
02:50:31,560 --> 02:50:32,960
Smoking hot bird?

4078
02:50:33,700 --> 02:50:34,680
Oh, I don't know.

4079
02:50:35,500 --> 02:50:36,960
I don't know about that.

4080
02:50:38,080 --> 02:50:39,540
I don't know about that, do you?

4081
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:43,780
Stevie, hot kiddo in your area, do you?

4082
02:50:43,940 --> 02:50:44,460
Whoa.

4083
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:49,800
Oh, starting to lag a little bit.

4084
02:50:49,980 --> 02:50:51,800
Oh, it's okay.

4085
02:50:53,820 --> 02:50:55,500
This was so fun, Henya.

4086
02:50:56,720 --> 02:50:58,400
Yeah, I hope you enjoy it.

4087
02:50:58,600 --> 02:50:59,460
I hope you enjoy it.

4088
02:50:59,480 --> 02:51:02,460
There's a lot of places that you can enjoy here.

4089
02:51:02,740 --> 02:51:05,600
So I really hope we can have fun together again soon.

4090
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:09,120
Yeah, I will have to find a place to make my home.

4091
02:51:10,160 --> 02:51:10,780
Oh, yeah.

4092
02:51:11,100 --> 02:51:12,940
Do you have any places you want to make it?

4093
02:51:13,240 --> 02:51:14,000
I don't know.

4094
02:51:14,120 --> 02:51:14,460
I don't know.

4095
02:51:14,600 --> 02:51:16,060
Maybe next to your house.

4096
02:51:16,520 --> 02:51:20,200
Maybe under your house, above your house, in your house.

4097
02:51:20,220 --> 02:51:21,920
Oh, do you want to see what's under my house?

4098
02:51:22,400 --> 02:51:22,680
Yeah.

4099
02:51:23,980 --> 02:51:24,440

There she goes.

4107
02:51:38,540 --> 02:51:42,440
I'm going to make a house inside her house, under her house,
above her house.

4108
02:51:43,540 --> 02:51:44,460
Let's accept.

4109
02:51:46,740 --> 02:51:48,480
Welcome to my basement.

4110
02:51:49,100 --> 02:51:51,000

02:57:00,460 --> 02:57:03,500
Like, I don't see, I don't wish that upon anybody.

4205
02:57:04,860 --> 02:57:04,880
Yeah.

4206
02:57:05,760 --> 02:57:06,740
Why would you steal?

4207
02:57:06,900 --> 02:57:07,740
Just ask her.

4208
02:57:08,040 --> 02:57:08,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4209
02:57:08,900 --> 02:57:09,180
Yeah.

Yeah.

4211

Okay, I'm going to go talk to my chat now, Hanya.

Bye-bye.

4217

Bye-bye.

4218
02:57:34,520 --> 02:57:35,400
Bye!

4219
02:57:36,100 --> 02:57:36,560
Bye!

4220
02:57:36,560 --> 02:57:36,580
Bye bye!

4221
02:57:50,050 --> 02:57:53,130
Oh, let me... I forgot to say by the mousy.

4222
02:57:53,890 --> 02:57:55,110
Let me go say bye to mousy.

4223
02:57:56,910 --> 02:57:58,530
And Zen too.

4224
02:58:00,010 --> 02:58:00,710
One second.

4225
02:58:03,390 --> 02:58:03,570
Oh.

4226
02:58:04,610 --> 02:58:06,330
Bye mousy.

4227
02:58:06,790 --> 02:58:07,950
Thank you.

4228
02:58:09,290 --> 02:58:09,770
Bye.

4229
02:58:10,210 --> 02:58:10,630
Zen.

4230
02:58:13,550 --> 02:58:24,910
a mouse is is is afk but maybe she'll see it and we could
steal stuff all right oh my gosh that sounds awesome if i

4231
02:58:24,910 --> 02:58:37,610
steal something she'll she'll ruin my life oh yeah baby that
sounds like the best thing ever you got braver with your

4232
02:58:37,610 --> 02:58:39,370
mask it's because she couldn't see my

4233
02:58:43,750 --> 02:58:45,910
Why does this fit on my head so well?

4234
02:58:48,750 --> 02:58:51,950
Why does this fit on my head actually so well, so perfectly?

4235
02:58:53,570 --> 02:58:55,090
Oh, well, maybe not perfect, perfect.

4236
02:58:55,810 --> 02:58:58,070
But it feels like my head was made to wear panties.

4237
02:58:59,470 --> 02:59:00,130
There we go.

4238
02:59:02,370 --> 02:59:02,990
There we go.

4239
02:59:03,170 --> 02:59:04,870
Oh, I just needed to make it a little bit smaller.

4240
02:59:07,310 --> 02:59:07,350
Perfect.

4241
02:59:11,170 --> 02:59:12,130
Your head is the size.

4242
02:59:12,150 --> 02:59:13,830
eyes of Henya's butt.

4243
02:59:14,590 --> 02:59:16,010
Dang, she's got a big butt.

4244
02:59:23,540 --> 02:59:28,660
So I guess I have to find a place to build a house in there.

4245
02:59:28,920 --> 02:59:30,700
Oh gosh, there's so many... Oh, wait, hold on.

4246
02:59:30,840 --> 02:59:33,200
I'm a little... It's a little wobbly.

4247
02:59:33,700 --> 02:59:35,400
There's so many people that joined the server.

4248
02:59:35,520 --> 02:59:43,520
I've never met Ari before, Froggy before, but they were so
nice and I'm nervous about meeting new people, but I will do

4249
02:59:43,520 --> 02:59:51,300
my best to be so I'll do my best.

4250
02:59:51,900 --> 02:59:53,620
You can't believe you're wearing Henya's panties.

4251
02:59:53,780 --> 02:59:55,720
She gave them to me for this purpose.

4252
02:59:56,720 --> 02:59:58,160
You can take that mask off now.

4253
02:59:58,280 --> 02:59:59,820
The rest of the team can't see.

4254
03:00:00,460 --> 03:00:01,720
What do you mean, the team?

4255
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,040
It was hot in there.

4256
03:00:07,020 --> 03:00:08,680
It was hot in there.

4257
03:00:11,180 --> 03:00:12,080
Thanks for the guide.

4258
03:00:12,220 --> 03:00:12,800
Thank you.

4259
03:00:12,960 --> 03:00:13,540
Oh my gosh.

4260
03:00:13,640 --> 03:00:16,660
I think also the...

4261
03:00:16,680 --> 03:00:29,340
um what's it called all the mods i i i there's so much to
like be able to ah it's a pervert um there's so much to

4262
03:00:29,340 --> 03:00:39,140
there's so much to create show joe server was amazing modern
minecraft is completely different by the way nice hentai

4263
03:00:39,140 --> 03:00:48,740
common cosplay thank you mint what are your thoughts on dog
dog oh no don't get me started dog dog don't get me started

4264
03:00:48,740 --> 03:00:53,840
about saying dog dog because once i start saying dog dog i
won't stop saying dog dog over and i just gotta be able

4265
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:59,080
compelled to say dog dog if i don't stop saying if i start
saying dog dog it can't stop saying dog dog i just gotta

4266
03:00:59,080 --> 03:01:11,220
keep saying dog dog i still prefer vanilla minecraft i think
both have its good things right because um because uh i

4267
03:01:11,220 --> 03:01:19,720
think i think the one thing if i could turn it off about the
vshojo server while but you know once dying and losing your

4268
03:01:19,720 --> 03:01:35,040
stuff is part of the thrill you know so it's part of the
thrill but but you know if if I if I I think for this it

4269
03:01:35,040 --> 03:01:45,140
seems very much more like like what's the word build
building stuff because there's so many pretty mods to like

4270
03:01:45,140 --> 03:01:53,400
customize your house and things like that they kill each
other a lot that makes sense too then you know it's also

4271
03:01:53,400 --> 03:02:02,660
what makes new players quit often i guess if you join a
server and uh and people are always there's a lot of pvp

4272
03:02:02,660 --> 03:02:11,000
then you know oh there were so many graves i believe it but
that was so fun oh i turned off my music earlier

4273
03:02:16,460 --> 03:02:18,380
I hope you guys enjoyed the tour as well.

4274
03:02:18,600 --> 03:02:22,760
Henya was so awesome for giving us such a nice tour.

4275
03:02:23,360 --> 03:02:27,060
And I hope you guys liked it.

4276
03:02:28,280 --> 03:02:31,020
Oh, there's a raid, but I can't read it.

4277
03:02:31,260 --> 03:02:31,580

4293
03:04:25,730 --> 03:04:37,490
um the gotcha with the i mean i guess chests are always
gotcha but i also really like that um that each one can be

4294
03:04:37,490 --> 03:04:46,210
taken like each person has a different different stuff in
the special chest it's so cool wait a month already hell

with the weapons as well okay that's what um yeah yeah

4297
03:05:00,470 --> 03:05:10,230

Henya and Mouse to help me go around and Mouse was giving oh

4298
03:05:10,230 --> 03:05:15,710
my gosh the Dejiko hat I when I saw her wearing it I was
like that looks so much like a Dejiko hat but maybe it's

4299
03:05:15,710 --> 03:05:26,610
just a cat hat but it was a Dejiko hat it was so cute and
and then Henya getting the Puchiko hat and this yeah her

4302
03:05:51,890 --> 03:06:05,070
protocol you know what was I gonna say Fab Achilles thanks
for a month I have to I have to figure out what I'm what I

4303
03:06:05,070 --> 03:06:12,790
what my house to be like I think the most the most
intimidating thing is like with all the mods I'm like you

4304
03:06:12,790 --> 03:06:24,210
know I'm not used to having so many more more options for
building so I have to get used to it I think hmm so we're

4305
03:06:24,210 --> 03:06:29,270
glad to see you going around the V show just server can't
wait to see you meet more new people and have fun on there

4306
03:06:29,270 --> 03:06:35,330
thank you make a maid cafe house I was thinking that I I was
thinking that.

4307
03:06:35,790 --> 03:06:37,610
There's like a million different blogs.

4308
03:06:38,210 --> 03:06:38,470
Oh.

4309
03:06:40,410 --> 03:06:41,710
The world is our oyster.

4310
03:06:42,890 --> 03:06:43,630
Haunted Made Cafe?

4311
03:06:43,790 --> 03:06:46,090
Why do you think I was collecting corpses, huh?

4312
03:06:48,030 --> 03:06:50,210
Why do you think I was collecting corpses?

4313
03:06:52,030 --> 03:06:54,330
I wonder if there are ghosts in the mod, though.

4314
03:06:55,250 --> 03:06:56,210
Like little wisps?

4315
03:06:57,970 --> 03:06:59,630
I wonder if there's wisps.

4316
03:07:00,490 --> 03:07:00,730
Mmm.

4317
03:07:01,430 --> 03:07:03,250
Make Shadow Moses Island.

4318
03:07:04,390 --> 03:07:14,110
You know, first of all, Henya making a ride-in reference was
not on my bingo list for tonight.

4319
03:07:15,870 --> 03:07:24,930
But also, with the extra blocks and everything, it might
even be possible to make wrecks.

4320
03:07:27,470 --> 03:07:29,470
Yeah, there's even RGB blocks.

4321
03:07:30,370 --> 03:07:33,730
Pretty sure even one of the builder mods adds over 4,000.

4322
03:07:33,750 --> 03:07:34,970
I was in new blocks.

4323
03:07:40,760 --> 03:07:42,160
Mid Cafe Rex.

4324
03:07:44,800 --> 03:07:46,640
I have to figure out what to build.

4325
03:07:47,800 --> 03:07:48,800
And I want to explore.

4326
03:07:49,440 --> 03:07:54,020
I feel like maybe a lot of the server has been explored
already, but that's okay too.

4327
03:07:54,920 --> 03:07:57,160
With Create, you can make a function Rex, I bet.

4328
03:07:57,260 --> 03:07:58,560
Oh my god, that would be...

4329
03:07:58,560 --> 03:08:00,360
That would be so insane.

4330
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:04,400
Hmm.

4331
03:08:05,880 --> 03:08:07,200
Metal Gear Mid Cafe.

4332
03:08:09,020 --> 03:08:09,540
Yeah.

4333
03:08:10,520 --> 03:08:11,760
There's still a lot to see.

4334
03:08:12,480 --> 03:08:12,640
Okay.

4335
03:08:14,120 --> 03:08:14,760
I'm excited.

4336
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:16,140
Claire, thanks for having me.

4337
03:08:16,560 --> 03:08:16,820
Thank you.

4338
03:08:18,820 --> 03:08:19,340
Yeah.

4339
03:08:19,820 --> 03:08:21,020
Minto streaming this late.

4340
03:08:21,500 --> 03:08:22,820
Yeah, it is pretty late, huh?

4341
03:08:23,060 --> 03:08:24,780
And I streamed late last night, too.

4342
03:08:25,420 --> 03:08:26,500
But we're just finishing up.

4343
03:08:26,680 --> 03:08:29,480
But I'm actually getting...

4344
03:08:30,500 --> 03:08:34,060
I think I have all my social energy.

4345
03:08:35,880 --> 03:08:39,040
social energy is just disappeared.

4346
03:08:39,940 --> 03:08:43,300
When social energy disappears, my energy disappears.

4347
03:08:43,720 --> 03:08:45,700
I also become just a tiny wisp.

4348
03:08:45,980 --> 03:08:47,300
It's hard to keep this form.

4349
03:08:48,580 --> 03:08:52,880
It's hard to keep this form when I become so sleepy.

4350
03:08:55,780 --> 03:09:04,940
But the V-Shojo girls are always in contact with Tofu, so if
you want something added, you could ask oh yes uh the way i

4351
03:09:04,940 --> 03:09:13,600
got added to the server was i joined some uh some discord
and actually i was having technical issues with with uh

4352
03:09:13,600 --> 03:09:24,000
minecraft just this morning or last night when i was trying
to get in um so i also was like tofu task it day i don't

4353
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:32,420
know tofu but they were very nice ghost tricking your way
through the club not even mouse is exploring the whole

4354
03:09:32,420 --> 03:09:47,780
server yet okay leave it to me we'll go on a grand adventure
we'll go on a grand adventure in the server the service

4355
03:09:47,780 --> 03:09:54,140
seems so friendly yeah yeah hi mint have you heard that the
metal gear solid board game drops this month if you get it i

4356
03:09:54,140 --> 03:10:00,200
wonder if we'll get a hand cam playthrough with matara
that's a great idea i pre-ordered it i pre-ordered it when

4357
03:10:00,200 --> 03:10:01,820
they first announced it so

4358
03:10:06,040 --> 03:10:09,140
We can see if that can be arranged.

4359
03:10:12,120 --> 03:10:14,140
Yeah, thanks for the idea.

4360
03:10:20,990 --> 03:10:21,450
Okay.

4361
03:10:22,650 --> 03:10:23,690
Does it have spoilers?

4362
03:10:24,570 --> 03:10:25,810
No, it's only...

4363
03:10:25,810 --> 03:10:28,070
It's only Metal Gear Solid 1.

4364
03:10:29,350 --> 03:10:29,710
I believe.

4365
03:10:29,910 --> 03:10:31,290
Oh, let me exit out of Minecraft.

4366
03:10:31,450 --> 03:10:32,610
I think it's...

4367
03:10:32,610 --> 03:10:32,770
Oh.

4368
03:10:35,170 --> 03:10:36,320
Hold on, let me...

4369
03:10:42,070 --> 03:10:42,890
One second.

4370
03:10:43,190 --> 03:10:43,650
We'll take...

4371
03:10:43,650 --> 03:10:44,910
We'll go to the maid cafe.

4372
03:10:46,890 --> 03:10:48,670
I'm lagging a little bit though.

4373
03:10:52,290 --> 03:10:54,650
Recently, my computer has been acting so funky.

4374
03:10:56,990 --> 03:10:58,070
Like, uh...

4375
03:10:59,710 --> 03:11:00,250
Um...

4376
03:11:03,060 --> 03:11:03,320
Oh!

4377
03:11:03,600 --> 03:11:04,720
Wait, where are you guys?

4378
03:11:06,560 --> 03:11:07,100
What?

4379
03:11:07,100 --> 03:11:08,200
Where'd you guys go?

4380
03:11:11,940 --> 03:11:12,140
Huh?

4381
03:11:13,800 --> 03:11:14,680
We're dead!

4382
03:11:15,600 --> 03:11:17,020
There's nothing on the menu.

4383
03:11:19,140 --> 03:11:24,000
I missed the last bit of ghost trick, but wanted to mention
after I finished it, I was so floored I had to immediately

4384
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:27,000
drop everything and go buy a sizzle plushie from Etsy.

4385
03:11:27,620 --> 03:11:29,240
Thanks again for introducing the game!

4386
03:11:29,420 --> 03:11:30,020
Of course!

4387
03:11:30,600 --> 03:11:32,600
Glad you liked it as much as I did.

4388
03:11:33,380 --> 03:11:34,280
Uh, one second.

4389
03:11:38,680 --> 03:11:41,400
Okay, there you are looking bulky.

4390
03:11:42,440 --> 03:11:59,900
there we go it's dark um I missed most of the stream but are
you excited to build I am I am I was gonna say oh oh my god

4391
03:11:59,900 --> 03:12:07,880
my um recently I was like trying to search for something on
my computer like you know how like when you go to the start

4392
03:12:07,880 --> 03:12:16,380
menu when you search for something but like I would go to
search and it stop it would like just the menu would

4393
03:12:16,380 --> 03:12:24,880
disappear it was so weird I've been having some weird issues
with my computer lately hopefully hopefully it's okay

4394
03:12:28,460 --> 03:12:43,200
mine stream my mine stream minecraft stream are back maybe I
don't want to I don't want to I still am trying to think

4395
03:12:43,200 --> 03:13:03,000
about a way to do a membu but I also realized I guess this
sounds kind of mean but if someone stops being a membu if

4396
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:08,920
they still had access to the server, to the Minecraft
server, it wouldn't be very fair so I'm still trying to

4397
03:13:08,920 --> 03:13:23,140
figure out how exactly to do it Um, but I also still want,
uh, to not a, not a modern Minecraft, like a vanilla one

4398
03:13:23,140 --> 03:13:23,740
too, maybe.

4399
03:13:24,360 --> 03:13:24,380
Hmm.

4400
03:13:24,640 --> 03:13:26,700
Give us the few Shoto server keys.

4401
03:13:27,120 --> 03:13:27,940
Oh yeah, totally.

4402
03:13:30,700 --> 03:13:32,960
Make it hardcore for giggles.

4403
03:13:36,400 --> 03:13:38,660
Uh, change the password every month.

4404
03:13:39,160 --> 03:13:40,120
Oh, mm-mm-mm.

4405
03:13:41,040 --> 03:13:41,640
Oh.

4406
03:13:43,400 --> 03:13:44,380
I guess that's a good idea.

4407
03:13:45,460 --> 03:13:46,900
You can change the password every month.

4408
03:13:47,620 --> 03:13:48,820
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4409
03:13:57,220 --> 03:13:59,040
Okay, that's a smart idea, you guys.

4410
03:13:59,540 --> 03:14:01,560
See, I'm glad I brought it up with you guys.

4411
03:14:04,220 --> 03:14:06,140
I'm glad I brought it up with you guys.

4412
03:14:18,730 --> 03:14:20,730
