1
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,100
I was muted.

2
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,760
I was muted.

3
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,060
Hello everybody, welcome to...

4
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,580
I forgot my bunny ears!

5
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,480
I set up everything else.

6
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:05,920
One second.

7
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,340
One second.

8
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,760
One second.

9
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,200
I forgot the most important thing!

10
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,320
I can't believe it.

11
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,640
I can't believe it.

12
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,240
I can't believe it.

13
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,160
I cannot believe it.

14
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,200
Wait, they're kind of big, aren't they?

15
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,920
It's a bit better.

16
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,660
Maybe, maybe.

17
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,500
That's a bit better.

18
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:16,680
Maybe.

19
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,680
Do they look even?

20
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,580
Thank you!

21
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,720
I like mates and money, girls.

22
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,260
Really?

23
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,660
Rascal does not dream of a made bunny girl.

24
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,580
Now we're ready!

25
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,500
That's why I love Toki.

26
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,500
She is a made...

27
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,900
No, it's so a bunny girl, you're so right.

28
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
One of them looks...

29
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,640
It's only when I look certain ways one looks bigger than the
other.

30
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,900
I fell asleep before the end of the collab last night, but
you did great for your first helldive.

31
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,840
Thank you!

32
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,360
Hopefully the devs fix that glitch that kept saying you were
killed by an innocent kettle.

33
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,080
I don't know what was going on.

34
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,760
So crazy, right?

35
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,060
And drink those things with the five gifted!

36
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,420
Put on the bunny ears mint.

37
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,160
We got a bunny garden to venture to.

38
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,720
If you don't have bunny ears on, it scares them away, you
know?

39
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,900
It's a fact.

40
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,620
It's a real fact.

41
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,220
Hold on, I am going to make myself a wee bit like that.

42
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,080
There we go.

43
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,990
This is a different busting than usual, huh?

44
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,710
Also, welcome back, Minto!

45
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:48,950
Thank you, nap nap!

46
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,390
What do you mean by that?

47
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,470
It's always the same kind of busting.

48
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,250
Love the collab last night.

49
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,150
Thank you!

50
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:58,810
So...

51
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,890
I am a big fan of curate games.

52
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,870
They always just appeal to me in the best ways.

53
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,950
Also, can you guys see my...

54
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,790
my eye...

55
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,450
tracker?

56
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,530
Is it on?

57
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,230
Can you see it?

58
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,290
We can see it?

59
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,530
I tried to make it not so, um, invasive.

60
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:32,570
I tried to make it like a little bit more, um, a little bit,
uh, what's the word?

61
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,090
A little less obvious.

62
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,030
Subtle, subtle, subtle.

63
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,210
It's a bit hard to see.

64
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:59,990
actually I didn't want it to like I didn't want it to like
get too in the way you know but also I changed the opacity

65
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:07,450
on it when I set it up earlier and now I don't know how to
change it we'll see yeah it's a little less distracting

66
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:14,990
let's see how it is in the game it might be easier to see
there Yeah, of course we can't have it get in the way of the

67
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,450
goods.

68
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,070
That'd be ridiculous.

69
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,250
Okie dokie.

70
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,990
So yeah, this game, like I said, I'm a fan of Q-Rite games.

71
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:32,450
This one is very much like Dream City Club, so my neurons
were especially...

72
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,450
Perked?

73
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,170
My neurons were especially activated.

74
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,910
As for the girls...

75
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,710
Can you see my mouse?

76
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,090
Yeah.

77
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,050
It's where the girls...

78
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:46,950
I'm thinking...

79
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:48,910
The...

80
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,850
The side pony girl looks like...

81
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,690
She's catching my interest the most.

82
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,030
But usually I like inner color.

83
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,950
But she's kind of like Gyaru-esque, so...

84
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,170
I'm kind of a fan.

85
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,130
So...

86
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,310
She's sassy!

87
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,270
I'm like... I mean her skirt...

88
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:12,930
Sorry, I'm kind of...

89
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,910
blocking it.

90
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,690
Everything?

91
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,770
I don't know what their names are.

92
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:26,870
That's the one thing about being like a streamer is wanting
to watch something, but also being like, no, I can't watch

93
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:32,610
it because I have to be the one, like I want to have a raw
reaction when I stream it, you know?

94
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,470
So, they're all good.

95
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,030
Short-haired tomboy is peak for me.

96
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,030
She's very cute.

97
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:48,010
And she's got kind of like a heme cut Going on a little bit,
but I like the pink the the blonde to pink fade.

98
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,010
I'm a big fan of that Middle girl is cute.

99
00:08:52,310 --> 00:09:00,310
She's just kind of She's kind of plain so it's like you know
not my type exactly

100
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:09,990
Middle one has default thigh highs are they thigh highs or
are they tights?

101
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,020
Oh wait, maybe that is a sliver Maybe that is a sliver of...

102
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,590
thigh.

103
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,710
Right there.

104
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,710
Looks like Tyson meat.

105
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,510
No, I think that's a sliver of thigh.

106
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,650
Right there.

107
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,120
Anyway.

108
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,980
The booba variety is lacking.

109
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:37,920
Yeah!

110
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,100
I mean, she's definitely the biggest.

111
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,540
Um...

112
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,760
It might have been nicer maybe to get some petangirls or
something.

113
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,840
But that's okay.

114
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,800
What's under extra?

115
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,780
I'm keep wondering.

116
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,700
Event CG.

117
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:04,990
This building?

118
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,990
That is...

119
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,670
Thank you!

120
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,850
This building I'm pretty sure is where the Chubby Girl Maid
Cafe is.

121
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,290
There was some other ones in there.

122
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,410
Does

123
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,870
this take place in Akiba?

124
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,530
Does this take place in Akiba?

125
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,570
I'm scanning the stream.

126
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,650
I'm unsure.

127
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,670
Fakiba?

128
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,870
Don't call it that!

129
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,790
Tutorial.

130
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,290
For what?

131
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,570
Event CG, album, and mystery.

132
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:16,880
Garden!

133
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,960
Alright, let's start.

134
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,040
Let's start!

135
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,960
What am I doing?

136
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,160
Me starting this game.

137
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,120
I'm

138
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,340
pretty sure.

139
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,490
That's so funny.

140
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,630
Why did I make such a big mistake?

141
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,850
I would never do something like that normally.

142
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,730
My company fired me.

143
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,490
The bunny maid girl in the lower left is the best IMH up.

144
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,910
Stop it.

145
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,650
Stop it!

146
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,470
Not even a bunny most of the time.

147
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,670
It is what it is.

148
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,370
Not the first time it's happened.

149
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,010
Oh wait, sorry.

150
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,230
I forgot to read your thing, Rico.

151
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,970
I think I reacted, but I forgot to read it.

152
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,590
Since my cat decided that he needs to be on my lap right
now.

153
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,990
How are things going with the quest to get Butaro a friend?

154
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:19,890
Wait, is it...

155
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,750
Oh yeah, Butaro.

156
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:24,490
Um...

157
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,400
I got him a friend.

158
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,520
I'm

159
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,900
a cat of friend!

160
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:48,820
Actually, I've been trying to, like, I've been not wanting
to say so much because I didn't want to say anything until,

161
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,360
like, they were adjusted entirely.

162
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,200
They're still, like, getting to know each other.

163
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:04,620
But, um, but, uh, because, you know, if they were, like, if
there was, like, something really, really wrong and they,

164
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:10,140
like, they couldn't get along at all, I wanted, you know,
might have to like take her back and i didn't want to be

165
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:20,080
like i got a friend and then i have to give her back to the
shelter or anything so but she's very very sweet she's very

166
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,220
very cute i'll talk more about her later though yeah yeah

167
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:34,640
i'm thankful they hired me in the first place i have nothing
but gratitude for the company my boss even cried for me when

168
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:44,160
they fired me he said i'm sorry i couldn't help you out They
told me that this company wasn't the right fit for me and

169
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,140
that there are other places where I could shine.

170
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,340
It was nice of them to say that.

171
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,900
Is there really somewhere out there?

172
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,620
Some place that would take in a fool like me?

173
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,800
Am I haito?

174
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,400
Am I haito for real?

175
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,460
Even if I could get another job somewhere else, I would just
mess everything up for the people there.

176
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,860
She's got a fetish for fine art, a pair of thigh highs, an
oversized sweatshirt, you know what I mean?

177
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,140
Even if I could just get...

178
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,800
Oh yeah, I would mess everything up for the people there.

179
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,960
Maybe my life is done for.

180
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,720
Maybe my afterlife is done for.

181
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,880
I don't even think it had started.

182
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,440
I want to play this too eventually so I can't watch the
stream.

183
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,120
Let me know what you think when you play it.

184
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,980
On a scale of zero to Stinky House.

185
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,420
No, she's perfect.

186
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,300
She's not Stinky at all.

187
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,860
She's so cute.

188
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,500
She's so cute.

189
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:49,840
Oh my god.

190
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,460
She's my little princess.

191
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,100
Time to drink my problems away.

192
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,340
Pretty sure there's a bar somewhere in this building.

193
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,300
I like the little open sign.

194
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,320
Oh wow.

195
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,860
We don't have that much money.

196
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:07,660
Oh!

197
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:11,680
See...

198
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,500
Oh, she's actually so cute.

199
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,160
Wait, I'm sorry?

200
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,900
Do you guys want me to read what she says too?

201
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,540
I guess it might be easier, right?

202
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,520
Just throwing out a guess here, but did something bad happen
to you?

203
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,500
That's why you're trying to drink and forget everything?

204
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,380
Are you trying to get me to go to your hostess club?

205
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,300
You're wrong.

206
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,160
You just happened to catch my eye before I got to work.

207
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,760
You caught my eye.

208
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,800
She looks like a little country bumpkin.

209
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:04,640
She's got like this plaid, like, ass caught on and, like,
her jean skirt.

210
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,400
It's just...

211
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,080
You look so tired as if you're after life, sorry, your life
is over.

212
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,180
Eyes up, girl.

213
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,900
My eyes are up here.

214
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,960
My eyes are up here.

215
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,820
I think it's a little off, but that's okay.

216
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,160
You might be right.

217
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,460
Oh, yay!

218
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,160
You are!

219
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,740
Oh my gosh, she's like, I knew it!

220
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:45,540
Yes, your life is... Oh my gosh, you just want to throw
yourself off Mante Bashi Bridge right now!

221
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,280
I get it!

222
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:52,460
Oh my gosh, I'm so glad that I was right, that you are so
down on your luck and such a sad, sad pathetic soul right

223
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,160
now.

224
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,460
Yeah, you should apologize!

225
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,680
Oh, gomanasari.

226
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,540
This isn't something to be happy about.

227
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,420
Gomanasari.

228
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,740
Honto ni, gomen.

229
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,700
Hi, that's all.

230
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,980
Hello, thank you!

231
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,720
I shouldn't have hit it right on the bullseye.

232
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,700
It's so sad to think your life is over.

233
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,040
Yeah, I know.

234
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,100
What should I do?

235
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,100
If I invite him in, then I'll really become a...

236
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,600
A trout?

237
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:37,740
A trout?

238
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,300
A trout.

239
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:39,960
Sorry.

240
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,820
Oh, I forgot that when I get out of the game, it, um.

241
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,640
A trout?

242
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,600
A prophet!

243
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,600
Thank you for the vibe.

244
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,440
Thank you!

245
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,660
I can't leave someone so hurt out in the cold!

246
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,700
A solicitor.

247
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,180
Oh.

248
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,360
I'll be a trout.

249
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:01,760
Hold on.

250
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,400
Oh, it's...

251
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,040
a bit more accurate now, maybe.

252
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,080
No, not really.

253
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:08,640
But that's okay.

254
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,420
Um, what do you mean?

255
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,680
It's a type of fish.

256
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,900
It's like a salesperson.

257
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,160
Got it.

258
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,400
You don't have to come into the shop.

259
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,640
You can just have a sneak peek.

260
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,500
That's right.

261
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,960
I don't know what's going on.

262
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,580
The truth is, I work here.

263
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,440
Oh.

264
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:41,700
I didn't know they opened this kind of bar here It's
someplace where I can drink with girls So when I was in

265
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:53,120
Japan For the two months I was there Actually by my train
station Every time I would get home There was a bunny girl

266
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:02,920
bar And it was kind of cold out So I couldn't see them in
the bunny girl Outfits But they had like giant coats on And

267
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:10,980
then the bunny ears it made it sexier because I couldn't see
like anything underneath but like you know I could see their

268
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:18,120
legs and I could see the bunny ears and I just imagined like
the the suit underneath and I was like wow this is so sexy

269
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,540
keep the jacket on girl keep it on

270
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:36,010
yeah so I was like I got to see bunny girls almost every day
It was so awesome.

271
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,290
The power of imagination.

272
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,970
It's some place I can drink with girls?

273
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,010
That's like any bar in Akiba, to be honest.

274
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,090
I've never been in a shop like this before.

275
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,510
It's clean, and the girls are...

276
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,810
So cute.

277
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,630
I guess I'll give it a try.

278
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,690
Oh, you're gonna get me in trouble, sir.

279
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,350
Wait, why?

280
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,130
I can't come in?

281
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:07,630
Oh my god, you're teased!

282
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,670
That's all for today.

283
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,990
I'll give you just a glimpse if you come inside that I'm
really a tout.

284
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,210
Appointment only?

285
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,390
I give you the right to come to the shop as a customer.

286
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,830
Whenever you're interested, I'll be waiting for you to come.

287
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,910
Haha, you're so sincere.

288
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,150
Their life isn't over.

289
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,370
You'll be okay.

290
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,030

291
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:43,750
Oh my gosh.

00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:44,950
Because of Bunny Girls!

293
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,630
Bunny Girls will save me!

294
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,770
This place actually looks so fancy.

295
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,710
Right now, even if it was small, Oh, sorry.

296
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,430
I've been so sleepy today.

297
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,570
I know you smiled.

298
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,150
That means you're not done yet.

299
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:08,530
Arigato.

300
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,050
She's so country.

301
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:19,530
Y'all.

302
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,990
I'll be here at this shop waiting for you.

303
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,750
I'm looking forward to the next time we can see each other.

304
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,450
All right.

305
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,430
All right.

306
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:40,930

me it's interesting I like the 3D mix with the with the CG

simple guy me too, Haito I wish I could name myself now I

308
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,970

everything I'm just going to go home

309
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,550
Oh my god.

310
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,950
Oh, wait, isn't that the prison princess girls?

311
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,090
On the wall?

312
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,710
Also, when I saw that in a brief moment, I thought it was
Fulamoko.

313
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,830
I thought it was Fulamoko.

314
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,030
Gorillas.

315
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:30,170
Is it sad that I recognized prison princess before gorillas
at all?

316
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:48,350
his little ipad he's got his computer with sticky notes

take something a girl said to me seriously when I don't even

319
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,250
know her name.

320
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:34,250
Also, when she works at a bar that, like, relies on
ensnaring men.

321
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,090
She didn't even seem to be joking around, but, you know.

322
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,290
They were green?

323
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,450
Oh my gosh, I was tossing between green and purple.

324
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,070
I mean, it's not like anyone has ever told me that my life
is done.

325
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,170
I'm the only one who thinks that.

326
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,170
If I don't finish it myself, maybe it's still possible to
start again.

327
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:55,990
Finish what?

328
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:57,710
Oh, hello?

329
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,730
I'm sorry for calling you without notice.

330
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,490
You know how you were saying work was busy and you needed
help?

331
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:03,850
Do you still need help?

332
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,210
If you'd like, would you take me?

333
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,790
Oh, Q!

334
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:08,490
What was that?

335
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,850
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

336
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:10,630
Oh, no, I'm skipping.

337
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,730
It's been a week since I started my new job.

338
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:18,270
Wow!

339
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,930
What should I use my money on?

340
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,150
Wait, I still have the same amount.

341
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,990
Uh, I haven't gotten any more money.

342
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,430
How much is $1,500 yen to US dollars?

343
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,430
Curious question.

344
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:39,390
Well, back in the day, it probably would have been about
$150 US dollars, but with the yen being as bad as it is now,

345
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,510
I'd say about $100 to $110.

346
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,090
Yeah, about $100.

347
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,110
Sheesh.

348
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,230
96?

349
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,530
No way.

350
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:00,810
Okay.

351
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:08,730
I saw like when people were going to like from Japan I saw
like they were flying to Hawaii they were bringing they were

352
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:15,990
bringing their own food because the conversion rate like I'm
like Hawaii is already very expensive but with the

00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,730
I'm hearing Maid Mint say my name again after all this time.

408
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,870
Dang, I'm lucky that Detective Manga is...

409
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:01,750
Hey, Conan!

410
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,370

That's right, I've never been here.

413
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,550
I'll give you a brief explanation on how it works.

414
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,230
Please, I don't know anything, so this will help.

415
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:34,150
The name of the shop is Bunny Garden, a fun place to drink.

416
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,710
That's all.

417
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:42,430
It seems like I should understand, but I don't.

418
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,930
Well, you'll gradually...

419
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:59,490
get used to it so it's okay i'll be really happy if we come
here lots of times i agree to do that i have to work hard at

420
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:08,490
my current he's already sipping maybe he feels like he feels
like he owes her you know he's just like you saved my life

421
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:13,030

It's over for my guy.

00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,470
Well, then I want to be able to give...

425
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:36,450
I want you to be able to do your best, so I hope I can give
you lots of healing.

426
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,430
That makes sense.

427
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,390
I feel like I can work harder if I feel better.

428
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:43,970
It's decided.

429
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,850
I didn't hear your order.

430
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:52,710
This is the menu.

431
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,750
She's so cute.

432
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,090
I'm sorry for what I said about just being too plain before.

433
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:00,950
I'll have a drink.

434
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:01,730
I'll have a drink.

435
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,770
What drink?

436
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,610
Did you want?

437
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,150
Customers must purchase a drink.

438
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,390
A price your drink could increase your likability.

439
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,090
Oh, ho, oh, ho, ho.

440
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,970
Let's see.

441
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,730
A Cassius Orange.

442
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:23,010
Cassius Liquor and Specialty Orange Juice.

443
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,230
With a low alcohol percentage, it is popular among women.

444
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:28,190
Oh, my gosh.

445
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,370
The fanciest beer I've ever seen in my life.

446
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,590
Blueberry Liquor.

447
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,750

Oh, deluxe.

449
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:43,810
This luxury champagne is rare and loved by celebrities!

450
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,110
It's very high in alcohol content, so be careful.

451
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,590
Lab Parry.

452
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,990
Highest quality grapes in age for several years.

453
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,190
It's popular for its fresh and mature taste.

454
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,340
Oh.

455
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,500
I thought I said Mori Calliope.

456
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,400
I'll have a gin and tonic, please.

457
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,940
Come and write... Why?

458
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,700
Who is Jin?

459
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,180
Shouldn't it... Wait, isn't it spelled with a G instead of a
J?

460
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,580
The green bunny girl saved my life.

461
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,900
What are you talking about?

462
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,820
Is it... Is it... Um... Is it because it's like copyrighted?

463
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,300
Sake.

464
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,400
It's a bit dry.

465
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,120
Easy drink.

466
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,760
A fine wine.

467
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,500
Vintage umeshu.

468
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,440
Bunny trap?

469
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,360
Infused with a sweet, gentle aroma, many people tend to
drink too much of...

470
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,080
Bunny punch!

471
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,900
Has a high alcohol content, but women seem to be fond of it.

472
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,180
Wait, I'm drinking this, right?

473
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,480
Or are they drinking it?

474
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,800
Maybe I'll try the bunny max.

475
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,200
Has a particular...

476
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,360
Strong peculiarity is not for everyone.

477
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,700
Oh, fill you up with power when drunk.

478
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,140
Recovering from depression.

479
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:24,020

recovering from depression yippee so this is my order okay

bunny trap and uh we can get her the bunny punch

482
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:57,120
I want to treat the cast members to a drink.

483
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,800
Some drinks that are more preferred than others, and some
are easier to get drunk on.

484
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,680
If you don't treat them to drinks, they will prioritize
other customers.

485
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,640
Treat your cast member to a drink.

486
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,540
I won't buy.

487
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,560
They will just leave me alone.

488
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,960
You saved my life.

489
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,200
Bunny!

490
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:18,860
Paz!

491
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,940
It tastes great.

492
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:29,140
Wait, I should probably prioritize the girl that I want to
get with, right?

493
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,800
Before I spend expensive drinks on her?

494
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:36,820
Uh-oh.

495
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,840
I think I messed up.

496
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,000
You can talk to the cast.

497
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,580
Something might happen.

498
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,100
What does that mean?

499
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,280
You can give a gift to each cast member once a day.

500
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,580
Gifts can be purchased from home.

501
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,620
You can treat the cast members to food.

502
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,000
There may be a preference for different foods.

503
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,340
I have no presents.

504
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,460
Let's just talk to her.

505
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,240
Let's get to know her.

506
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,280
I'm getting kind of nervous.

507
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:18,900
Why?

508
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,680
I'm using therapy and medication.

509
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,920
The player kicker is the one recovering from depression.

510
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,280
Birds with no goddess.

511
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,580
Keep taking your meds.

512
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,440
My eyes are up there!

513
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,360
What do you mean?

514
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,840
Wow, look at her bunny ears.

515
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,980
I mean, it's going to be the first time I meet this next
customer.

516
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,460
My heart feels like it's going to explode from how fast it
is.

517
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,440
Well,

518
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,440
what am I saying?

519
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,900
The purpose of this place is to make customers feel relaxed,
not stressed.

520
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,480
You mentioned how you like to look into roller coasters
rides, so I highly recommend the ACE documentary on

521
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,220
Aerodynamics.

522
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,880
They shape the modern landscapes of roller coasters.

523
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,100
Oh, thank you.

524
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,300
I will look into it.

525
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,020
Thank you.

526
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,500
But yeah, we're relaxed, we're relaxed.

527
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,760
If I'm going to stay like this, I'm sure the customer is
going to feel the same.

528
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,280
Come on now, you've got this.

529
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,500
She's like saying all of this to my face.

530
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,080
Don't ask what my job is.

531
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,720
Let's start off with the usual.

532
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,380
The first step in order to become friends.

533
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,140
You're the customer, so please, go right ahead with
everything you've got.

534
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,280
The first step.

535
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,940
Oh, okay.

536
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,340
Oh, okay.

537
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,180
What about a hug?

538
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,360
Oh, I'm cringing.

539
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,800
Oh, the toast is good.

540
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,640
The toast is good.

541
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,480
There are some things that affect likeability.

542
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,980
Choose your words carefully.

543
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,440
Where's my hug?

544
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,920
Oh, come on, girl.

545
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,620
Come on, little bunny girl.

546
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,720
Where's my hug?

547
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,800
Let's do the toast.

548
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,760
Let's do the toast.

549
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,640
So a toast or something?

550
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,360
She liked it.

551
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,500
That's the spirit.

552
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,120
You seem eager to start drinking.

553
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,680
But don't you think sharing each other's names come first?

554
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,960
I read your name tag.

555
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,260
Wait, no.

556
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,460
Hold on.

557
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,160
Move your hands.

558
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,080
There we go.

559
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,400
Oh, she doesn't have a name tag.

560
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,960
I'm going to make a bunch of flashbacks.

561
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,440
I'd love to know more about you.

562
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,780
Right, my name is Mint Phantom.

563
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,440
Oh,

564
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,480
gosh.

565
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,920
I'm so jealous of everyone named Haito right now.

566
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,360
I'm so jealous of everyone named Haito.

567
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,380
Haito right now.

568
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:35,940
Wait, Minto?

569
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,640
Haito?

570
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,520
It's kind of close.

571
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:42,460
Right?

572
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,860
You don't need to keep looking at me like that.

573
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,200
The models in this game look so good, by the way.

574
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,360
Like the...

575
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,160
The faces are so cute.

576
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,520
I like actually how soft the features are.

577
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,100
Like they look like that.

578
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,800
They just look really good.

579
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,600
I wanted to remember your name and face, you see.

580
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,140
So I was doing my best to store that into my head.

581
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,040
Yeah, they look so cute.

582
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,380
They're so cute.

583
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,440
But there's no need to worry.

584
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,360
I've matched your face to your name now.

585
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,140
It's my turn now.

586
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,180
My name is Kana.

587
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,080
I don't mind if you give me a nickname, but I know, but I
sure hope you remember me.

588
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,520
I'll give you a nickname, alright.

589
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,200
From this day on, you're a bitch-chan.

590
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,280
Alright, I'll do my best to match your name to your face
then.

591
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:06,060
Bitch Chan Bitch Chan Bitch Chan Bitch Chan

592
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:18,200
Don't you guys ever seen?

593
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,860
Have you guys ever seen diabolic lovers?

594
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Girl love that That was his nickname for the girl Are you
being mean?

595
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:29,580
No!

596
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:31,960
No!

597
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,360
I'm trying to Riz her!

598
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,400
What are you talking about?

599
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,880
I watched the Otomei show and I know now!

600
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:39,980
I know!

601
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,220
Stop it, you're making me all flustered!

602
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,400
I didn't know it felt this embarrassing to be stared at!

603
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,820
Not diabolic lovers.

604
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,200
I suppose there's some things you learned from first-hand
experience.

605
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,720
I got a little smarter from this whole situation.

606
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:07,720
Oh my god.

607
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,900
Kind of grew one brain cell that day.

608
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,300
Don't change the genre on your own.

609
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:18,580
Ew.

610
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,420
Sorry.

611
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,440
Tell me more about yourself, Haidt-Kun.

612
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,300
I messed up real bad at work recently.

613
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,480
Because of that, the boss fired me.

614
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,780
So I've been assisting a friend at his work ever since.

615
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,210
That sounds wrong.

616
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:51,210
Is this what the kids call nagging?

617
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,190
What's that mean?

618
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,070
What's nagging?

619
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,390
If it's what the kids call, I don't know.

620
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:07,880
If I was in your shoes, I probably wouldn't even be able to
eat.

621
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,080
Though I'm sure words can't express just how awful you must
feel.

622
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,900
Oh, gaslighting.

623
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,840
Negative edging?

624
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:19,300
Hmm?

625
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,300
I got it.

626
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,980
Oh, egging!

627
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,200
I'm so sorry!

628
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,020
Oh my gosh.

629
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,420
Neging is pickup, Lingol.

630
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,960
We're treating women horribly, and they claim it gets all
the women.

631
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,680
Oh, that sounds like diabolic lovers, for real.

632
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,720
I'm going to do my absolute best in order for you to get
back on your feet.

633
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,800
Okay, I need to get myself to- I need to get myself
together.

634
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,500
Oh, I need to- Is it hot in here?

635
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,320
Try to be- I'm- I am, I am, I am!

636
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,980
I'm trying to be nice!

637
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,620
I'm trying- I'm using lingo that I learned from a show that
apparently was bad.

638
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,060
bad.

639
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:15,780
I'm...

640
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,980
I'm... I'm doing...

641
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:20,940
I bought her good... I've bought her the good juice, okay?

642
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,280
That time you spend here will be with a constant smile.

643
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,940
I can assure you that much.

644
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:40,360
I hope we get along, Haito, and then I'm gonna steal your
soul until you turn into this black silhouette of yourself

645
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,360
and you can never leave.

646
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,620
Does that mean we go three times?

647
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,980
The one, two, three?

648
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,680
Heyto, should I get you more drinks?

649
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,560
I can keep going, but I'll only continue if you want to.

650
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,080
There's a fee?

651
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:08,680
Oh my god, this place is so expensive and so real!

652
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,360
Oh my gosh.

653
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,000
Let's switch, yeah, yeah.

654
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,880
Thank you.

655
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,630
I thought you were going home already.

656
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:21,750
Oh gosh, I'm a sucker.

657
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:23,670
What drink did you want?

658
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,370
Wait, can I switch out?

659
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,110
Uh-oh.

660
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:31,410
Oh no, I'm stuck with her!

661
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:31,970
Uh-oh.

662
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:32,830
Dang.

663
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,370
Oh, I'm getting sucked dry.

664
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,810
Here, we'll go, we'll go with the...

665
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,650
I'm gonna go with the sake and she'll get the blueberry
liquor.

666
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:47,130
Can I have some too?

667
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,130
Oh wait, this is how I...

668
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,510
This is how I switch.

669
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,730
A customer called me, so I better get going.

670
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,890
I was just cheap-skating this guy.

671
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:08,570
I can't believe he is not buying me another drink.

672
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,710
I can't believe it.

673
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:10,750
Oh, bye-bye.

674
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,270
Who's gonna come over here?

675
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,290
Oh, oh, oh.

676
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:18,530
What's your name?

677
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:19,810
Hi.

678
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:21,930
Miuka.

679
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:24,350
Hi.

680
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:29,070
Hi.

681
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:30,210
Hi.

682
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,210
Would you like to introduce yourself?

683
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,370
Oh, she's so cool.

684
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:34,850
She's cool, did it.

685
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:36,410
Oh, yeah.

686
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,330
You may call me Haito Kanda.

687
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:40,630
Oh.

688
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:43,850
You don't have to be polite with me.

689
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,250
I see.

690
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,350
I mean, okay, I'm Haito Kanda.

691
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,050
I help my friend for work.

692
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:53,890
You help your friends?

693
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:59,290
Yeah, I was working at a company up until recently, but I
got messed up and fired.

694
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:02,710
I don't know if that's like the first thing you want to keep
telling people, you know?

695
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:04,530
I don't know if like...

696
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,290
Hi, I'm Haito Kanda.

697
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:09,850
I got fired recently.

698
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:15,170
I'm Haito Kanda.

699
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:16,910
Fired.

700
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:31,530
right uh are you bad at holding a conversation are you a
person a few words are you angry are you mad that I lost my

701
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:46,490
money I got fired with Riz I'm thinking this one maybe it
seems not very offensive are you a person a few words oh oh

702
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:51,490
Ah, I guess I don't speak much.

703
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:56,770
She doesn't even use an honorific.

704
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:59,090
She just calls me Haito straight up.

705
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:00,750
She hates us, you guys.

706
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:01,910
She hates us.

707
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:05,330
I'm sorry.

708
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:06,790
What does that mean?

709
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,750
I'm like this.

710
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:14,910
I can't fix her.

711
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,150
I'm sorry, I'm like this.

712
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:19,890
Maybe you won't be able to have a good time.

713
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:20,850
It's okay.

714
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:22,250
Who knows what will happen.

715
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:23,470
We just met each other.

716
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:27,330
I think it would be nice if we could just take things slow.

717
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:28,190
No rush.

718
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,250
We already started to get to know each other.

719
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:30,650
Oh,

720
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:34,970
she's so cute.

721
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:37,130
Thank you.

722
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:43,690
Haito, you're a kind one, Haito.

723
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:44,510
Oh, sake.

724
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,250
She's so cute.

725
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:53,890
Do you want some alcohol?

726
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:55,310
What should I do?

727
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:56,950
Is there anything I should prepare?

728
00:47:58,890 --> 00:47:59,810
Oh, extend?

729
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:02,270
Yes.

730
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:11,250
My efforts have been rewarded.

731
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:13,250
I want to drink something delicious.

732
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:17,150
What drink did you want?

733
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:21,690
Let's do the same thing that we did with Kana in the
beginning, right?

734
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:22,910
I get the bunny trap.

735
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,430
And she gets the...

736
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:26,530
Wait, do I have enough money?

737
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:29,650
9,000 just to say...

738
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,050
Wait, is there a table charge?

739
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:33,450
Wait, is there only two extent?

740
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:35,250
Like, wait, do I...

741
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:36,410
What?

742
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:37,050
Mm-hmm?

743
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:43,190
So would it be 9,000?

744
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:44,170
or 6,000?

745
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:48,890
Don't worry about it.

746
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,290
I'm gonna have the bunny trap.

747
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:57,530
Can I have a drink with you?

748
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,850
Oh, our little chibi is so cute.

749
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,870
I'm gonna get you the bunny punch.

750
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:09,980
Yata.

751
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,540
I like this.

752
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:22,570
Oh, Oh, cute!

753
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:25,550
Cute, cute, cute, cute, cute.

754
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,590
Oh, I think you just dumped it all over the ground.

755
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:32,010
She took one sip and was like, mm-mm.

756
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:35,790
Oh, wait, no, they put their drinks under the bar like that.

757
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:37,650
There's like a little shelf there.

758
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:38,570
Oh, that's so cute.

759
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:41,170
Um.

760
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:42,790
Um.

761
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:44,530
Um.

762
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:45,230
Um.

763
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,690
Is there anything you want to talk about?

764
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,610
You think tomorrow will be...

765
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:56,950
Oh yeah, the weather deck, let's go.

766
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:58,890
You think tomorrow will be sunny?

767
00:49:58,990 --> 00:49:59,610
I don't know.

768
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,210
I have no idea.

769
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,530
Shall we look up the weather forecast?

770
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:08,930
Are you always curious about the weather?

771
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:12,550
Uh, not really.

772
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,530
I'm just making small talk.

773
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:16,550
Uh...

774
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:16,990
Sorry.

775
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:18,470
Sorry.

776
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:22,170
I didn't mean anything by that.

777
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:27,970
This is a business venture, and buddy stonks are through the
roof.

778
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:29,570
Yeah!

779
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:32,770
If you do go bankrupt, just get a loan.

780
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:33,510
They will understand.

781
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:35,530
Watching you play this on my birthday is certainly
interesting.

782
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:36,390
Exendo!

783
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:37,530
Happy birthday!

784
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:42,650
Happy birthday to you.

785
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:45,650
Happy birthday to you.

786
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:48,430
Happy birthday, dear Exendo.

787
00:50:50,750 --> 00:51:05,030
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday I love blue women Ah,
so true Gosh, she looks like one of my...

788
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:13,910
She looks like an Oshi I had that graduated I mean except in
maybe the The one report But she's...

789
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:16,050
I can't stop looking, seeing my Oshi

790
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:28,410
This is who I am all the time.

791
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:29,650
Is that okay with you?

792
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:31,390
It's all right with me.

793
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,370
We're just starting to get to know each other.

794
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:38,450
You're a peculiar one.

795
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:40,890
You laughed us now, didn't you?

796
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,930
You have a cute smile.

797
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:45,370
Thank you.

798
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:47,350
Thanks for the 20 gift.

799
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:50,590
It's getting late.

800
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:52,130
I should go home soon.

801
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:55,550
Oh!

802
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:03,470
So it is 9,000.

803
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:04,810
Oh my god.

804
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:13,990
If you can please the cast members in the shop, they will
see you out in a good mood when you leave.

805
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:15,570
We pleased them.

806
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:22,610
We did a good job Haito, who is sent off, is more motivated
to work and earn a higher salary for one week.

807
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:29,730
Higher motivation for work can lead to a raise and an
increase in base salary.

808
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:44,330
This should make up for part of the memberships.

809
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:45,810
I've missed these past years.

810
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:48,430
Also, my tickets to your karaoke bot.

811
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:49,150
I can't stop listening.

812
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:49,790
Stop!

813
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:52,270
Thank you so much.

814
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:52,730
Thank you.

815
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:54,350
There was no ticket.

816
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:55,630
What are you talking about?

817
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:00,370
Yeah, thanks for everything.

818
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:01,650
See you soon.

819
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:07,630
So it's this place here, right?

820
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:08,210
What?

821
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:11,610
Oh man, I'm gonna get a bento after this.

822
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:14,990
It was such a nice place and the customer service is great.

823
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:16,950
Maybe I'll go there for the time being.

824
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:32,750
bunny garden oh what can we get you can purchase gifts to
give to the cast on rare occasions the lineup may change

825
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:43,990
socks Gucci socks perfume makeup plush that is a really
expensive plush toy holy cow

826
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,430
Macarons are a good gift, right?

827
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,440
See, it's Gucci, but with a Q.

828
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,040
So wouldn't it not be Gucci?

829
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,880
I want macarons now.

830
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,370
I'm thinking about them.

831
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:18,210
When I lived in Japan, at Family Mart, they released a pack
of two macarons.

832
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:21,830
One was strawberry flavored, and the other one was
pistachio.

833
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:24,190
And I'd get it once a week.

834
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:25,290
It was so good.

835
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:29,670
It was so good!

836
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:32,970
Oh, I'm drooling think I'm yummy.

837
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:35,650
Which one was better?

838
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,090
I think I like the pistachio one.

839
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:39,650
I really...

840
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:41,330
Oh my god, turtles!

841
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:42,350
Tickets!

842
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:43,930
Sorry about the typos!

843
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:47,290
Stop, thank you!

844
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:48,230
Thank you!

845
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:56,470
Okay,

846
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:01,150
okay.

847
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:02,990
Let's get some macarons.

848
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:05,090
Cha-ching!

849
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:07,630
What's my schedule?

850
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:10,170
You can check the schedule except her birthday!

851
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:15,150
Oh, okay.

852
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:16,670
We can only see up until September.

853
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:22,390
What is the dispatch?

854
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:23,610
Oh, we're not recruiting.

855
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:23,970
Okay.

856
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:29,390
You can get the vacation to a cast member who invited you.

857
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:32,770
We can go.

858
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:34,130
Oh,

859
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:39,620
wait.

860
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:39,920
Okay.

861
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,140
There we go.

862
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,040
We can gamble.

863
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,060
You can try gambling.

864
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,220
Of course, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.

865
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,820
Keep your fingers crossed and consider taking on the
challenge.

866
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,740
Yeah, I do want to gamble a little bit.

867
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:54,660
Gambling?

868
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,440
Oh my, wait!

869
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,560
What?

870
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,840
That's a lot of money.

871
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,260
That's a lot of money.

872
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:16,700
No, no, no.

873
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,740
Save, save the game!

874
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:19,780
Save the game!

875
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Oh my gosh, so cute.

876
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,220
Woohoo!

877
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:25,860
Woohoo!

878
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,940
Is this a hobby?

879
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:34,810
What does that mean?

880
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:36,870
Oh, I don't have any.

881
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:38,010
I thought I took that picture.

882
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:43,550
Oh, sold out.

883
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:45,830
Okay, time to go to Bunny Garden.

884
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:47,050
I'm rich again.

885
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,270
Now is my time to rest up and recover.

886
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:53,330
This is the only place that can heal my mind.

887
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:57,970
I think I am Haito, and I'm realizing very quickly that I
have a problem.

888
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:09,120
The cast member who likes you the most will serve you
immediately after you enter.

889
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,600
Increase your likeability, and you might end up with the

Is that, wait, Miuka is the short-haired one, right?

898
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:53,970
I am still curious about the other girl, but I feel like
she's kind of out of my league.

899
00:57:54,530 --> 00:58:00,510
I feel like she's kind of like the type that's, that

Sure, what's up?

00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,740
Why did you have to do the hand gesture with it?

913
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,100
You got fired.

914
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,580
Yeah, I'm the guy that got fired.

915
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,840
Yes, thank you.

916
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,260
You're not gonna let that go, huh?

917
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:17,100
She doesn't remember my name.

918
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,060
Fish want her.

919
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,320
Women scare her.

920
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,740
What's your name again?

921
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,160
Haito Kanda.

922
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,140
Haito.

923
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:25,480
Haito?

924
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:28,660
Haito.

925
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,360
Minto.

926
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,880
Everybody remember my name.

927
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,360
I'm Minto.

928
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:36,760
I'm Mint.

929
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,660
I'm mint.

930
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,400
I'm mint.

931
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:41,700
I'm mint.

932
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,120
I'm mint.

933
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:44,760
Minto.

934
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:45,960
I'm mint.

935
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:56,190
I'm mint.

936
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:00,650
They're back again.

937
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:03,150
I came to see you, Miyuka-chan!

938
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:05,850
Should I have not come?

939
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:07,750
I just ended up here.

940
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:08,730
I'm mint.

941
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:10,790
No, you're Murphy.

942
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,240
I don't care if you've got that silly wig on.

943
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,610
Are you sure?

944
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:32,270
Lock in.

945
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:34,650
Got it, pistachio.

946
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:36,330
Dang, messed up, sorry.

947
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:38,110
What do you...

948
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:39,530
I'm scared.

949
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:41,670
I feel like I'm coming off too strong if I say this.

950
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:43,230
Maybe should I not come?

951
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:46,890
Maybe I gotta be like, Did you not want to see me, Miyuka?

952
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:49,690
I don't know what she wants to hear.

953
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:53,070
Mint's kazoo covers?

954
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:55,090
Wait, where is my kazoo?

955
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:56,550
I have one actually.

956
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:58,190
No, I'm mint.

957
01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,030
No, me!

958
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:02,750
Play hard to get.

959
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:04,530
Should I have not come?

960
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:09,910
No, it's not that.

961
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:14,390
You must be low on money though.

962
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:17,330
Don't worry, I gambled!

963
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:19,950
This is a collecting mission.

964
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:21,370
to charm all the girls.

965
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:23,090
We can't let the other customers have them.

966
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:26,690
Use codec 80.08.

967
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:27,830
Got it.

968
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:28,290
Colonel!

969
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:32,370
You're that curry ninja.

970
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:36,870
I'm helping out my friend now, so it's okay.

971
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:38,750
You don't have to worry about that.

972
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:41,290
I'm not worried.

973
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:42,810
Okay.

974
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:44,950
It's my turn to be Nint.

975
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:45,790
Never!

976
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:48,710
Unless I possess you.

977
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:49,930
Actually, I'm Mint.

978
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:50,290
No!

979
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:51,050
Oh, me!

980
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,810
You must spend your money wisely.

981
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:57,370
It's necessary to live.

982
01:01:58,450 --> 01:01:59,910
Yeah, I'll make sure to do that.

983
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:05,770
All wifus are OSPs?

984
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,910
Thanks for coming here to spend that important money.

985
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:11,070
You're welcome.

986
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:13,070
Thanks for showing me...

987
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:14,190
I have a gift for her!

988
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:17,090
I feel strange to say you're welcome after that.

989
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:19,450
Why?

990
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:20,370
You smiled for me.

991
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:21,570
me again.

992
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:26,210
It's so creepy when we say that.

993
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:34,610
Oh, you still haven't had enough to drink.

994
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:36,630
Do you want to order anything else?

995
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:38,570
I too am also meant.

996
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:45,390
Oh my god, this face is the cutest.

997
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:46,730
What?

998
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:47,830
What?

999
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:51,270
Should we try...

1000
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:52,450
What's the other girl's name, Rin?

1001
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:53,270
That's what you guys said?

1002
01:02:57,870 --> 01:02:58,310
Hmm...

1003
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:01,790
Oh...

1004
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:04,990
Yeah?

1005
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:06,970
Okay, let's try her.

1006
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:08,310
I'm gonna get something cheap.

1007
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:15,150
Can I have a drink with you?

1008
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:17,790
Sorry.

1009
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:24,970
Thank you for all this over chat to you guys.

1010
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:25,950
Thank you!

1011
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:30,130
Looks like a customer is calling, so I better get going.

1012
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:32,230
Bye-bye.

1013
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:34,910
Miuka.

1014
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:38,790
She's so cute.

1015
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:41,970
Oh my gosh, wait, she's so cute.

1016
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:44,250
She's so...

1017
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:50,390
Sorry,

1018
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:55,630
I got that gamer posture.

1019
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:57,570
She called me cute.

1020
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,930
Why are you curled up in a ball, sir?

1021
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:00,970
What's wrong?

1022
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:10,810
She's really cute.

1023
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:12,370
You must be nervous.

1024
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:13,270
That's no good.

1025
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:15,610
Getting nervous over me is just a waste of energy.

1026
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,690
Hello, my name is Haito Kanda.

1027
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:21,130
It's a pleasure to meet your acquaintance.

1028
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,160
That's hilarious.

1029
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,400
You started introducing yourself.

1030
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,600
I'm also...

1031
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,440
Hello, I'm Rint.

1032
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,740
I have a pepper in my throat.

1033
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:28,710
Oh.

1034
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:29,430
Oh.

1035
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:38,090
Oh my god.

1036
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,830
Oh, I'm crying.

1037
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:44,010
No.

1038
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:49,070
Girls start coughing and straight up passed away.

1039
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:51,290
Oh my god, hold on.

1040
01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:53,070
I'm going to go get some more water.

1041
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:56,230
I think...

1042
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:57,390
I'm so sorry, you guys.

1043
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:58,190
Give me one second.

1044
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:59,090
I'm so sorry.

1045
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:00,850
I told you.

1046
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:01,570
It's the Gyaru.

1047
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:04,010
It's the Gyaru.

1048
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:06,410
I can't deal with the reju!

1049
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:12,340
I can't deal the reju!

1050
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,100
I'm back, sorry about that.

1051
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,500
I'm back with baby tomatoes.

1052
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:42,300
Okay, Rin is actually trying to, um, actually trying to
Exercise my soul, but that's okay!

1053
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,400
That's okay!

1054
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,160
That's A-O-K.

1055
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:51,400
Haichan.

1056
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:55,860
What do you do, Haichan?

1057
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:58,880
Right now, I'm assisting an acquaintance with their job.

1058
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:03,590
Oh, my gosh.

1059
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:06,230
You can't keep saying that you're such a mess up, my guy.

1060
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:07,990
You can't stop saying...

1061
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:09,010
Don't say a plethora...

1062
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:09,150
Okay.

1063
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:11,570
Until recently, I was employed at a company.

1064
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:15,030
However, due to a plethora of mistakes, I was terminated.

1065
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:17,870
That does not make you look good.

1066
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:20,670
Why are you... Why are you saying that?

1067
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:25,050
Why... This guy has the worst, like, elevator pitch ever.

1068
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:42,530
I get her, though.

1069
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:43,630
I get her so much.

1070
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:44,970
Hang on, Hai-chan.

1071
01:08:45,570 --> 01:08:46,350
I can't keep up with all this.

Yaru-Mint, my dreams come true.

01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:56,010
What dreams are you having?

1080
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:03,250

01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:05,030
I'm gonna give her my macarons.

1082
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:07,570
You're like a stand-up guy.

1083
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:09,330
You must get that a lot, huh?

1084
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:12,510
Let me hear some more.

1085
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:16,270
Let me hear some more.

1086
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:25,680
What?

1087
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:26,360
Who is they?

1088
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:27,840
They do.

1089
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,000
You must get that a lot.

1090
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:29,880
They do what?

1091
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:30,160
Who?

1092
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:32,840
I want some more.

1093
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:33,180
Oh yeah!

1094
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:34,300
I want some more!

1095
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:36,840
Let me hear some more.

1096
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:42,940
You're such a kind, upstanding person, Haichan.

1097
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:43,100
Like, you're such a good person.

1098
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:45,300
Beepa!

1099
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:45,860
Hey!

1100
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:47,740
You're such a good, good, good, good, good.

1101
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,840
Oh my god, I paid for this service.

1102
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:50,280
So you know what?

1103
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:50,980
It's...

1104
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,060
You're such a kind, upstanding person, Haichan.

1105
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:59,760
It's so true, you know, like, you're so kind and so
upstanding.

1106
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:01,500
Like, how's that?

1107
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:08,220
Oh,

1108
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:19,460
hey, like, let me tell you something.

1109
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:20,540
I'm serious.

1110
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:24,400
Well, I'm always serious, but like, now I'm, like, serious.

1111
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:25,540
seriously serious.

1112
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:37,780
Southern Mint is still my favorite mint.

1113
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:41,520
Meeting new people is really important, right?

1114
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:47,100
So like in life, I mean, like, so I'm really grateful to
have like met you, Haichan.

1115
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,300
Oh my gosh, she's so sweet.

1116
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:01,830
I'm hook line and sunk.

1117
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:04,450
Gosh, I've been fished by Rin.

1118
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:11,860
I think so.

1119
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:17,680
I may be far from perfect, but I'll still do the very best I
can.

1120
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,580
I hope you're ready.

1121
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,680
Oh my God, like how cute she is!

1122
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:33,260
She's just a silly girl!

1123
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,040
She's just a silly girl!

1124
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:40,280
She's just a silly girl!

1125
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:42,740
How embarrassing!

1126
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:44,520
Wait, like, what am I saying?

1127
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:46,880
I'm just like, so silly.

1128
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:49,140
Well, you get the idea, right?

1129
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:50,460
Did you catch all that?

1130
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:51,840
Because I won't say it again.

1131
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,400
Uke-er!

1132
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:03,320
Oh my god, and she's even vouching for the other girls.

1133
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,240
She's like the best.

1134
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,260
She's a girl's girl.

1135
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:06,940
She's an everybody's girl.

1136
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:07,920
She's so great.

1137
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,200
Focus on the prize.

1138
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,620
You keep glancing at the other two girls.

1139
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,280
I'm trying to decide, you know.

1140
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:15,280
You know.

1141
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,520
But it is kind of like one of those, like, when you see the
other girls, you're like, what am I missing out on, you

1142
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:20,620
know.

1143
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:31,090
Mm-hmm.

1144
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:37,430
By the way, the other girls here are all really nice too.

1145
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:39,410
I think you'll like this shop a lot.

1146
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:53,390
If you find that I'm not your type after talking to me a few
times, feel free to sat...

1147
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:55,870
Saddle?

1148
01:13:58,690 --> 01:13:58,790
Saddle?

1149
01:13:59,030 --> 01:13:59,470
Saddle?

1150
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:02,550
Slide?

1151
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:07,410
What does this mean?

1152
01:14:10,010 --> 01:14:10,610
Saido.

1153
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:17,790
Saido.

1154
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:21,690
Up next to another girl instead.

1155
01:14:21,810 --> 01:14:23,070
Oh my gosh, she's so sweet.

1156
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:29,030
I'm not the type of girl who's like bothered by that sort of
thing.

1157
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:41,910
Well, on the other hand, if you do find that I'm your type,
it'd make me, like, pretty happy.

1158
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:53,950
I don't know how I feel about her, like, rubbing her hands,
though, like, a bond villain.

1159
01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:01,630
Maybe she's a little more evil than we know, you know?

1160
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:07,410
She's like, yes, yes.

1161
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:12,730
Yes, by the bunny trap.

1162
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:13,370
Yes.

1163
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:18,930
I'm not the type to get upset about those things, but you
know you want to stick with me.

1164
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:20,050
Yes.

1165
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:22,710
She's scheming.

1166
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:26,210
Well, I'll leave it at that for now.

1167
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:28,410
With that said, I look forward to serving you.

1168
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:38,630
Have you not had enough to drink, Kai-chan?

1169
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:40,730
If you want some more, I can get you some.

1170
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:43,290
Oh, yes.

1171
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:49,290
You did it.

1172
01:15:49,410 --> 01:15:50,990
That was about to get so lonely.

1173
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:54,590
She has the same embarrassed pervert smile as me.

1174
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:55,690
What are you talking about?

1175
01:15:55,930 --> 01:15:58,410
What do I want?

1176
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,320
The bunny trap, of course.

1177
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:10,380
Wait, does it even matter what I...

1178
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:11,360
Wait, so wait.

1179
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:15,960
I guess it does matter what I order, because the more I
spend, the more they like me, right?

1180
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:19,440
So...

1181
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,860
So it's just an overall price.

1182
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:24,500
Yeah, yeah.

1183
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,380
This tastes so good.

1184
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,840
She's so cute.

1185
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:51,210
Let's give her the present.

1186
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:57,550
If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?

1187
01:16:57,930 --> 01:16:58,870
I hope you like it.

1188
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:01,870
I got something?

1189
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:03,470
I got something good.

1190
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:06,090
Okay.

1191
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:14,990
Can we Riz all three?

1192
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,380
Can our wallet handle it?

1193
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:19,410
I don't know.

1194
01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:23,290
Man, I'm really no good at this formal stuff.

1195
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:24,630
I just can't do it.

1196
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:25,950
What good is it anyway?

1197
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:30,030
It's meant to show respect to the person you're speaking to.

1198
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:31,910
I know.

1199
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:34,370
Yeah,

1200
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:48,190
I know that much, but you can still show respect without it,
right?

1201
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:51,830
Oh my gosh, she messed up her words.

1202
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:53,910
So cute.

1203
01:17:55,390 --> 01:17:58,270
I guess it's a way to easily convey that to respect the
person.

1204
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:06,850
That's too on the nose.

1205
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,330
I don't think that'd be necessary.

1206
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:10,750
It'd be annoying for one thing.

1207
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:14,290
Some people place a lot of importance on that sort of thing.

1208
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:16,110
Can we get drunk in this game?

1209
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:22,030
Oh, that's true.

1210
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:25,050
I can't tell you how many times I've been snapped at.

1211
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:28,490
You can?

1212
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:30,890
Where's the drunk meter?

1213
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:40,790
I guess I don't want to leave people with rotten feelings
either.

1214
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:43,910
I've got no choice but to brush up on speaking more
formally.

1215
01:18:50,670 --> 01:18:52,970
Oh wait, this is good practice for me too.

1216
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:56,690
The best way is to learn their experience.

1217
01:18:57,010 --> 01:18:57,630
I'll try it now.

1218
01:18:58,230 --> 01:18:59,050
Okay, let's start.

1219
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:01,750
Are you doing well, Rin-chan?

1220
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:03,930
Yes.

1221
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:06,930
Do you enjoy this job?

1222
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:08,650
Is she only just going to say hi to everything?

1223
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:09,390
Yes.

1224
01:19:09,930 --> 01:19:10,290
Hi.

1225
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:13,250
Do you like formal speech?

1226
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:15,590
No.

1227
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:16,890
No.

1228
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:18,090
Do you have any hobbies, Nin-chan?

1229
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:20,110
Breathing.

1230
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:23,930
Let's stop, Nin-chan.

1231
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:25,830
You're fine the way you are now.

1232
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:28,850
Wow, is it already this late?

1233
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:29,970
I'm going to go back.

1234
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:30,670
Oh, my gosh.

1235
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:31,890
I think I'm leaving.

1236
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:33,730
losing brain cells just talking to her.

1237
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:44,680
Thank you, meantime.

1238
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:45,500
Bye bye.

1239
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:46,280
See you tomorrow.

1240
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:48,240
Thanks for everything.

1241
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:48,900
See you soon.

1242
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:56,050
I'm motivated for what?

1243
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,920
That's what I imagine that's like.

1244
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,360
Oh, I didn't see them tomorrow.

1245
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,540
Oh, I got paid a lot though.

1246
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:31,050
Gambling time.

1247
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:38,820
Come on.

1248
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:39,780
Come on.

1249
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:40,980
Come on.

1250
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:41,480
Kamisama.

1251
01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:49,550
No!

1252
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:02,940
Okay, one more.

1253
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:03,320
One more.

1254
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:03,640
We'll see.

1255
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:03,960
We'll see.

1256
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:10,060
I know I saved scum, but I want to have the belief that...

1257
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:10,200
Wait.

1258
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:11,140
The red eye.

1259
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:12,180
That wasn't there before, right?

1260
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,060
This is good, right?

1261
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:13,720
This is good?

1262
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:15,400
Oh.

1263
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,680
We can win it back!

1264
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:30,060
Campbelling buds.

1265
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:31,720
This is it!

1266
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:34,260
We'll win it all back and then some!

1267
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:37,720
Yike!

1268
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:43,780
I think...

1269
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:46,140
I think we won it all back actually.

1270
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:54,220
I don't think we made even a single Yenny back.

1271
01:21:58,630 --> 01:21:59,710
Oh, still down?

1272
01:22:00,610 --> 01:22:01,890
Okay, one more time, one more time.

1273
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:13,990
5k short oh two two two eyes two eyes two eyes two eyes two
eyes

1274
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:34,360
one more one more one more oh it's two eyes again i don't
trust it anymore

1275
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,240
button?

1276
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:04,260
Thanks, Joshua!

1277
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:10,820
I like how whenever you're eating sometimes you sometimes
pout in and out, even during yesterday's stream.

1278
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,280
It's so cute, like little chipmunk.

1279
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:13,900
Or dare I even say it.

1280
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:14,560
A bunny.

1281
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:19,710
Stop it.

1282
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:21,150
Stop watching me eat.

1283
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:24,690
Stop watching me eat.

1284
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:33,250
Okay, well, that's last one.

1285
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:35,030
This is it!

1286
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:35,970
This is it!

1287
01:23:36,130 --> 01:23:36,390
This is it!

1288
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:36,830
This is it!

1289
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:37,230
This is it!

1290
01:23:37,290 --> 01:23:37,710
This is it!

1291
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:39,210
Come on!

1292
01:23:58,910 --> 01:23:59,490
I

1293
01:24:12,570 --> 01:24:14,470
think we should reset the safe.

1294
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:18,970
I think we should...

1295
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:20,430
Oh no, no, no, I pressed...

1296
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:23,410
I pressed... I pressed one more on accident!

1297
01:24:24,030 --> 01:24:26,490
I pressed... Instinctually instead of the...

1298
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:27,070
Go back!

1299
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:27,850
Uh-oh.

1300
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:28,470
Oh god.

1301
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:28,990
Well, it's okay.

1302
01:24:29,070 --> 01:24:30,090
We're gonna reload anyway.

1303
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:31,550
Unless...

1304
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:32,170
Ooh!

1305
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:33,990
Not enough though.

1306
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:53,440
Okay.

1307
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:54,440
Okay.

1308
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:59,080
Most gamblers quit just before they win big.

1309
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,100
I know.

1310
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:07,980
What else can we buy?

1311
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:09,300
Hmm.

1312
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,840
I think she would like a necklace, but I'm not rich enough
yet.

1313
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,320
To really...

1314
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:15,860
Oh, perfume!

1315
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:16,600
She would like that.

1316
01:25:27,610 --> 01:25:28,090
Motivation!

1317
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:30,230
Oh god.

1318
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:35,350
One dispatch consumes two days.

1319
01:25:35,610 --> 01:25:37,450
Be careful not to overwork and ruin your health.

1320
01:25:38,610 --> 01:25:39,170
Oh, okay.

1321
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:41,970
We can get so much more!

1322
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:44,670
Any hairstyle.

1323
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,730
Inaba, inaba, inaba, take!

1324
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:50,850
Just gamble more.

1325
01:25:52,070 --> 01:25:53,990
It wastes a day though, yeah, you're right.

1326
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:57,310
No, no, it's not that much for just, for like.

1327
01:25:58,470 --> 01:26:04,050
Well, actually it's more than I, it's more than I made in a
whole week, but with just one day, right?

1328
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:07,110
No, two days, it wastes a week.

1329
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:07,750
Ah.

1330
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:12,610
But then do I also get the money from my friend on top of
that?

1331
01:26:17,190 --> 01:26:19,510
Do I also get the...

1332
01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:37,360
Gambling looks more worth it.

1333
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,140
Gambling is safer!

1334
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:41,320
Oh wait, oh I made 500...

1335
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,540
Wait, I made 57k?

1336
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:44,880
Oh, just kidding.

1337
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:45,560
Never mind.

1338
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:47,160
Get out of here.

1339
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:49,260
I can gamble.

1340
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:51,760
The game says I can gamble.

1341
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:54,580
Oh, I would have gambled.

1342
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:56,600
We just once.

1343
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,320
Just once, you guys.

1344
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:00,100
Just once.

1345
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:04,840
I'm praying on you.

1346
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:05,800
Big boss.

1347
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:19,990
Don't pray to God.

1348
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:21,230
Pray to big boss.

1349
01:27:22,030 --> 01:27:23,210
You want to continue gambling?

1350
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:27,710
Now I'm going to go spend lots of money on girls.

1351
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:30,830
My time to spend money.

1352
01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:32,150
I mean, rest up and recover.

1353
01:27:32,890 --> 01:27:34,830
This is the only place that can heal my mind.

1354
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:44,270
Cast members may be away on Saturdays.

1355
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:47,090
Why not try having a conversation with other cast members?

1356
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:51,090
Thanks, Rin-chan!

1357
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:54,030
What do you mean, what?

1358
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:03,150
I won big today!

1359
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:05,050
We're getting...

1360
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:07,810
Oh wait, if I get this...

1361
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,450
I want that for her.

1362
01:28:11,970 --> 01:28:12,930
You're a simp.

1363
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:13,950
Yeah, I am.

1364
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:14,810
Thank you.

1365
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:19,330
Simping for my bunny Oshi so she has funds to simp for other
bunny girls.

1366
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:20,930
The circle of life!

1367
01:28:21,670 --> 01:28:22,110
Stop!

1368
01:28:25,330 --> 01:28:26,470
Yeah, get that for her.

1369
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:27,870
Okay, I'll get the bunny trap again.

1370
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:32,170
Of course, Din-chan!

1371
01:28:32,450 --> 01:28:35,670
Go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go.

1372
01:28:35,670 --> 01:28:36,050
Really?

1373
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:40,810
Hooray!

1374
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:41,770
I'll get the bottle!

1375
01:28:42,630 --> 01:28:44,810
This is like, so actually I've made cafes.

1376
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:46,150
You can do stuff like this too.

1377
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:57,070
And like a lot of cafes, like themed cafes in Japan, um,
like you can buy a champagne bottle and just like share with

1378
01:28:57,070 --> 01:28:58,590
the girls and stuff like that.

1379
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:00,710
Sometimes you can, um,

1380
01:29:03,730 --> 01:29:07,010
I think sometimes you can even buy a bottle and just for the
girl to keep.

1381
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:10,570
Like they don't, you don't even get to drink any of it.

1382
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:13,920
Whoa!

1383
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:16,980
Whoa!

1384
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,840
That looks more than before, right?

1385
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:21,280
Am I crazy?

1386
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:26,240
That looks like the more, the more, the more, the more, the
more.

1387
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,060
Lacey, a little bit.

1388
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,160
I have a present for you!

1389
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,040
If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?

1390
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:38,600
I hope you'll like it.

1391
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,600
I'm glad you came back.

1392
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:52,240
Thank you!

1393
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:53,700
Like, have you been gut?

1394
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:56,880
Yeah, you seem like you're in a good mood too, Nin-chan.

1395
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:06,720
Brayden MC only, but...

1396
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:12,660
What good would I be if I couldn't put on a smile?

1397
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:16,080
You actually don't look like you're feeling so great
yourself.

1398
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:17,200
Really?

1399
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:20,440
I'm feeling fine physically today, and I don't have any
problems.

1400
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:25,380
I'm not?

1401
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:26,520
I'm not?

1402
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:29,220
You're definitely not feeling good.

1403
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:30,240
Not at all.

1404
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,020
This is a bad omen, you know?

1405
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:38,580
Get it?

1406
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:39,840
Today's fortune!

1407
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:42,160
Oh my god, she's an empath, yeah.

1408
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:48,940
Oh my god, no way.

1409
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:55,920
Not only is she scamming me, like, in the bar, but she's
also scamming me, she's a scamming fortune teller, too.

1410
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:57,380
Oh my god, no!

1411
01:30:58,420 --> 01:30:59,240
Where is Kana?

1412
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:00,560
It said she took the day off.

1413
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:01,420
Mm-hmm.

1414
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:05,060
On Saturdays, it said that they can sometimes take the day
off.

1415
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,080
But hey, sir, you're lucky.

1416
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,280
In fact, I can judge based on your name.

1417
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:10,260
Wanna try?

1418
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:14,020
Like fortune-telling with names?

1419
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:15,720
Sure, I'll give it a try.

1420
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:16,740
Okay, okay.

1421
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,320
Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1422
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:24,800
Mm-hmm.

1423
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:26,340
Do you remember it?

1424
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,080
I know your name already.

1425
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:30,780
You're telling me.

1426
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:31,980
what it was last time, right?

1427
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,680
Yeah, I introduced myself to you.

1428
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:54,040
I've had to do this before.

1429
01:31:58,120 --> 01:31:59,660
I've had to do this before.

1430
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,020
One time, one time I...

1431
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:05,520
I met someone that I had met before.

1432
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:07,780
But I couldn't remember their name.

1433
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:11,300
And I had to write down their name for something.

1434
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:14,700
And I was just like, oh, hi.

1435
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:17,020
I'm taking everybody's names.

1436
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,520
I just need to make sure it's spelled correctly.

1437
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,500
Can you let me know how to spell it?

1438
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:25,260
And they were like, it was like the most simple name ever.

1439
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:26,300
I don't even remember.

1440
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,000
It was like, like Mike or something.

1441
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,900
They were like, Mike?

1442
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:35,680
like oh yep

1443
01:32:40,310 --> 01:33:04,440
you know I could have been with like I don't know see like a
Q so I was like thank you I need to know how it's spelled to

1444
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:05,360
do the fortune telling

1445
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:20,200
do you spell your name in kanji oh she's at see you can get
away with that in japan right oh actually should we do kanda

1446
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:29,880
or haito she likes to be formal i mean i'm not for she likes
to be um informal so mike

1447
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:44,150
it's spelled in hiragana oh she might like that too because
she's dumb and she can't spell she can't write the kanji

1448
01:33:45,290 --> 01:33:49,670
spelled in hiragana no

1449
01:33:55,260 --> 01:34:03,300
way that my strategy is totally darn I read that this would
be a hundred percent foolproof first the characters for cup

1450
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:20,880
and person then dry and field that's how you spell haito
kanda remember now cup and person so hi hi oh wait I was I

1451
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:31,580
was thinking kan like kan like the kami sama kan and then da
is field yeah the the rice field cup person dry field

1452
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:44,260
cup person you got me huh I like totally forgot your name
really sorry aw she looks sorry

1453
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:51,860
You know, she tried.

1454
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:55,820
Cuphead.

1455
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:00,800
I found a way on mine to learn someone's name after you
forget it.

1456
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:03,500
I set to offer to tell their fortune with it.

1457
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:04,300
Clever, huh?

1458
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:10,520
How did you figure it out?

1459
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:11,980
Was I acting suspicious?

1460
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:16,060
You seem like the type of person who can't tell a lie,
Rin-chan.

1461
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:18,660
It was written all over your face and how you were acting.

1462
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:21,900
I know.

1463
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:27,810
People usually tell me they can read me like an open book.

1464
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:34,940
Sorry,

1465
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,600
I totally remember about how do you spell your name again?

1466
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:42,760
Meant?

1467
01:35:42,860 --> 01:35:43,440
Meant?

1468
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:44,360
Meant?

1469
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:45,320
Meant?

1470
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:46,420
Meantos?

1471
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:47,500
Meantos?

1472
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:49,980
First with an M.

1473
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:52,000
my arms.

1474
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:55,620
Then with an I, I'm standing tall.

1475
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:59,800
Then with an N, no other way.

1476
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:01,520
Last is a T.

1477
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:03,880
Take it away.

1478
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:05,360
Mint.

1479
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:22,560
You guys are still spelling it wrong.

1480
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,280
Would you freestyle that?

1481
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:25,540
I freestyle everything.

1482
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:29,500
I'll live honestly.

1483
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:32,420
It's like so tiring to cover things up with lies.

1484
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:36,820
It's easier to just be honest and then apologize when you
get scolded.

1485
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:47,860
I'm really sorry, Haichan.

1486
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:50,160
You told me your name, but I forgot it.

1487
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:51,800
And I tried to pull the wool over your eyes.

1488
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:52,880
I'm really sorry.

1489
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:54,320
It's all right.

1490
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:56,000
It didn't bother me at all.

1491
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:57,820
It just matter.

1492
01:36:58,060 --> 01:36:59,000
How am I supposed to be mad?

1493
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,380
Made menthol star!

1494
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:06,880
For real?

1495
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:07,920
Like, yay!

1496
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,200
Let's kick back and have some fun!

1497
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:11,940
We'll go extra hard today to make up for my...

1498
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:13,360
Make up for my scurrilla!

1499
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:14,720
Tint!

1500
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:17,460
No!

1501
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:20,520
I said M like my arms!

1502
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:26,800
Time totally flies when I'm with you, Haichan.

1503
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:27,760
What shall we do?

1504
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:29,660
Will you stay with me for a few more rounds?

1505
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:30,880
Yes.

1506
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:31,300
Yes!

1507
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:31,720
Yo-cha!

1508
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:39,000
Actually, actually, yo-cha.

1509
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:39,080
Actually, yo-cha.

1510
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:41,400
Yakuzao.

1511
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:52,650
I think I've already spent a good amount of money, so I'm
gonna get a highball.

1512
01:37:53,470 --> 01:37:55,950
An elegant finish that cannot be found at other places.

1513
01:37:59,210 --> 01:38:00,410
Mid mic.

1514
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:01,130
Stop!

1515
01:38:06,450 --> 01:38:07,730
Of course.

1516
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:11,350
Um...

1517
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:12,590
Wait, I already got this, right?

1518
01:38:12,690 --> 01:38:12,910
Yeah.

1519
01:38:14,510 --> 01:38:15,150
Um...

1520
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:15,790
We're gonna...

1521
01:38:15,790 --> 01:38:17,910
We're gonna get you...

1522
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:19,290
Let's get you the...

1523
01:38:20,330 --> 01:38:22,290
The bunny punch again.

1524
01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:27,670
Mmm, tasty!

1525
01:38:28,730 --> 01:38:30,050
Here we go.

1526
01:38:30,510 --> 01:38:31,650
Yeah, reach for it.

1527
01:38:36,770 --> 01:38:38,730
It's written like bint.

1528
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:39,770
No!

1529
01:38:40,910 --> 01:38:41,930
What's the food?

1530
01:38:43,110 --> 01:38:44,270
Oh, edamame!

1531
01:38:45,190 --> 01:38:46,250
Oh my god, pizza.

1532
01:38:46,730 --> 01:38:47,070
Whoa!

1533
01:38:47,970 --> 01:38:48,830
Quality suit.

1534
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:50,950
I feel like these should be switched, right?

1535
01:38:51,970 --> 01:38:52,710
Special parfait.

1536
01:38:54,990 --> 01:38:58,010
Hope you're enjoying your time with the spiciest yellow
bunny girl, Rin.

1537
01:38:58,370 --> 01:38:58,830
Minto!

1538
01:38:59,230 --> 01:38:59,770
Thank you!

1539
01:39:02,370 --> 01:39:03,030
Yes.

1540
01:39:05,090 --> 01:39:05,610
Pizza!

1541
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:08,470
Additive free pizzas.

1542
01:39:11,130 --> 01:39:12,770
This place is fancy.

1543
01:39:13,450 --> 01:39:13,970
Assorted candies.

1544
01:39:16,530 --> 01:39:17,050
Salad.

1545
01:39:18,310 --> 01:39:19,090
Rich flavor.

1546
01:39:19,430 --> 01:39:19,930
Everything is...

1547
01:39:20,530 --> 01:39:22,110
A lot of potato flavor.

1548
01:39:25,810 --> 01:39:29,650
When she rubs her hands together, I can only see the guy in
the yellow suit behind the tree meme.

1549
01:39:31,210 --> 01:39:31,990
What's that one?

1550
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:37,850
My kamiyoshi, Michael Phantom, That's not my name.

1551
01:39:38,650 --> 01:39:40,230
I want some French fries.

1552
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:43,990
Obeyishii!

1553
01:39:45,930 --> 01:39:46,330
Yes!

1554
01:39:48,970 --> 01:39:49,970
Are you okay with ghosts?

1555
01:39:50,410 --> 01:39:51,210
What about you, Rin-chan?

1556
01:39:51,370 --> 01:39:52,090
Are you afraid of them?

1557
01:39:52,330 --> 01:39:52,490
Okay.

1558
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:54,830
This?

1559
01:39:57,350 --> 01:39:58,470
Rin-chan, don't let me down.

1560
01:39:59,870 --> 01:40:00,990
Don't let me down, Rin-chan.

1561
01:40:01,850 --> 01:40:02,510
This is...

1562
01:40:03,410 --> 01:40:04,950
I know I am, thank you!

1563
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:08,010
All-natural pizza fresh off the pizza tree.

1564
01:40:10,010 --> 01:40:11,290
Don't let me down.

1565
01:40:11,690 --> 01:40:12,870
Don't let me down, Bean.

1566
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:25,500
Tascaru?

1567
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:32,320
Tascaru?

1568
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:38,640
If one showed up in front of me, I'd smack it.

1569
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,740
I guess I would.

1570
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:44,600
Look at her face though.

1571
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:47,740
Is

1572
01:40:58,130 --> 01:40:58,690
she...

1573
01:40:58,690 --> 01:40:59,690
I'm no afraid.

1574
01:40:59,830 --> 01:41:00,750
I'm not afraid of them.

1575
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:02,350
I'm not afraid of them.

1576
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:05,130
I'm not afraid of them.

1577
01:41:09,610 --> 01:41:10,170
Right?

1578
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:16,630
People are just scared of them.

1579
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:18,990
All they can do is startle you basically.

1580
01:41:21,170 --> 01:41:24,390
I guess it's time for my username to be...

1581
01:41:24,390 --> 01:41:26,190
To be relevant again.

1582
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:31,030
Thanks Ghost Darker!

1583
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:39,940
I can do way more than just startle you, Rin.

1584
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,660
Have you ever seen a ghost before, Rin?

1585
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:52,440
I haven't.

1586
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:55,420
I wish one would show itself to me at least once.

1587
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:55,880
Me!

1588
01:41:58,360 --> 01:41:59,440
I'm right here!

1589
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:00,380
I'm right here!

1590
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:02,340
I'm right in front of you!

1591
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:04,240
Wait, so she could smack me?

1592
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:08,600
Yeah, maybe they're afraid of you because I think you're
gonna smack them.

1593
01:42:13,820 --> 01:42:16,180
The poor things, I just want to see one.

1594
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:17,480
Yeah, bye now!

1595
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:23,180
Maybe you'll meet one if you hang around abandoned buildings
or haunted spots.

1596
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:28,660
Or, you know, like an abandoned maid cafe!

1597
01:42:39,980 --> 01:42:42,140
Why is chat spamming Bustin?

1598
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:43,160
Am I missing something?

1599
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:46,140
Are they?

1600
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:47,920
To be honest, I didn't notice.

1601
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:49,540
I thought you weren't afraid of ghosts.

1602
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:51,660
Wobake is a weak one.

1603
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:53,840
Woke?

1604
01:42:56,860 --> 01:42:57,340
Wake?

1605
01:42:57,340 --> 01:42:57,420
Wake?

1606
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:01,180
Weak!

1607
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:04,680
Excuse me, weak!

1608
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:11,230
Ghost is weak so they aren't scary.

1609
01:43:11,890 --> 01:43:13,890
But if a monster jumped out, I'd be terrified.

1610
01:43:28,290 --> 01:43:28,970
Not weak.

1611
01:43:30,590 --> 01:43:31,310
Not weak.

1612
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:42,590
Abandoned buildings are dark and damp, you know?

1613
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:44,150
Monsters like places like that.

1614
01:43:44,490 --> 01:43:53,090
They could pop out for sure Thought monsters and ghosts were
basically the same thing Oh, um, actually Oh,

1615
01:43:57,270 --> 01:44:03,310
actually Um, actually, um, actually not at all.

1616
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:04,450
They're totally different.

1617
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:06,110
I could never fight a monster.

1618
01:44:06,590 --> 01:44:07,570
Those guys seem tough.

1619
01:44:07,870 --> 01:44:10,210
They're huge with fangs and claws too risky

1620
01:44:16,970 --> 01:44:18,330
She's kind of cute when she's scared.

1621
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:21,210
Oh, it's so scary.

1622
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:23,810
That'd be awful if I thought about those monsters tonight.

1623
01:44:24,230 --> 01:44:25,970
Oh, do you need someone to...

1624
01:44:25,970 --> 01:44:26,830
I could be the...

1625
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:34,650
She's going to think about me.

1626
01:44:36,310 --> 01:44:36,990
She's going to think about me.

1627
01:44:36,990 --> 01:44:37,410
She's going to think about me.

1628
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:40,630
W, just like your arms.

1629
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:43,670
plasm you're made of.

1630
01:44:44,010 --> 01:44:45,110
Hey, all of the simping.

1631
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:47,670
Okay, the response this dono deserves.

1632
01:44:48,730 --> 01:44:49,170
Weak.

1633
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:51,950
Weak.

1634
01:44:53,350 --> 01:44:54,590
Weak, weak, weak.

1635
01:44:56,050 --> 01:44:58,250
If that happens, I'm blaming it on you, Haichan.

1636
01:44:58,650 --> 01:45:00,150
Next time I see you, I'll smack you.

1637
01:45:00,410 --> 01:45:00,570
Uh-huh.

1638
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:01,410
Just kidding.

1639
01:45:01,890 --> 01:45:02,410
For free?

1640
01:45:05,290 --> 01:45:08,990
But you have fangs.

1641
01:45:09,110 --> 01:45:10,030
I have one fang.

1642
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:12,170
Time to extend.

1643
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:14,210
Let's continue.

1644
01:45:15,490 --> 01:45:17,470
All right, all right, all right.

1645
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:18,930
I want something that's gonna...

1646
01:45:18,930 --> 01:45:21,570
Oh, depending on the person, it seems easy to become
intoxicated.

1647
01:45:21,730 --> 01:45:24,030
I want something that's gonna make me drunk.

1648
01:45:26,710 --> 01:45:27,130
Yeah.

1649
01:45:27,770 --> 01:45:28,770
What does she like?

1650
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:31,450
I think I've spent a lot of money.

1651
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:34,090
Does she like...

1652
01:45:34,090 --> 01:45:35,050
Like a lemon sour?

1653
01:45:36,590 --> 01:45:38,790
No, everybody likes a lemon sour, right?

1654
01:45:39,130 --> 01:45:39,910
Ghost are kind of weak, though.

1655
01:45:40,050 --> 01:45:40,550
Just hit him with like...

1656
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:41,950
Oh, ow, stop it!

1657
01:45:43,870 --> 01:45:45,230
Rin's armpits.

1658
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:54,680
She like the Bunny Punch a lot.

1659
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:56,480
Get Rin drunk?

1660
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:01,760
Oh, hey!

1661
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:02,920
Oh, he see!

1662
01:46:04,180 --> 01:46:04,480
Drunk.

1663
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:05,140
Drunk.

1664
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:06,940
Yeah, girl, we're getting ready tonight.

1665
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:07,680
We're partying!

1666
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:10,360
Itadakimasu.

1667
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:12,100
Itadakimasu!

1668
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:17,440
Flat is best.

1669
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:18,560
Flat is justice.

1670
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:20,900
I...

1671
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:22,520
Flat is justice.

1672
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:24,440
I'm just... But, you know...

1673
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:26,520
I'm not gonna be against anything.

1674
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:30,060
I'm a...

1675
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:31,240
I'm a...

1676
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:32,880
I'm a bubba connoisseur.

1677
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:42,700
This is bringing back trauma about having to explain my
overly specific knowledge and lingo use with

1678
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,040
Let's talk.

1679
01:46:50,740 --> 01:46:53,400
What do you usually do when you're home alone, Rin-chan?

1680
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:02,440
So you're an otaku too?

1681
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:04,360
She's an otaku!

1682
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:06,360
She's a keeper, everybody!

1683
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:07,260
What?

1684
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:09,380
Oh my god, best girl!

1685
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:11,440
She's so good!

1686
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:12,360
She's a gamer.

1687
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:15,820
She's a... she's a anime enjoyer.

1688
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,440
I usually watch anime and read manga.

1689
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:19,860
Sometimes I play video games.

1690
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:22,260
Isn't that about all there is to do?

1691
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:23,020
Really?

1692
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:24,060
I'm a bit surprised.

1693
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,640
I thought you'd be more into girly stuff.

1694
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:26,880
Gyalu-poy?

1695
01:47:30,140 --> 01:47:31,340
So true.

1696
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:33,260
What do you mean girly stuff?

1697
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,060
Gyalu stuff.

1698
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,500
Doesn't everyone watch anime and read manga?

1699
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:37,820
She's a keeper.

1700
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:38,600
Oh!

1701
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:46,040
She's so great.

1702
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:47,680
Oh, she's so good.

1703
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:49,240
Dean Chan!

1704
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:52,780
I don't care if something's...

1705
01:47:52,780 --> 01:47:54,960
If something's girls or whatever.

1706
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:56,740
I just do what I want to do.

1707
01:47:58,380 --> 01:47:58,700
You're right.

1708
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,460
It's not good to make assumptions like that.

1709
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:01,660
Sorry, Dean Chan.

1710
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:09,340
Do you think Irene likes girls?

1711
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:10,460
Asking for myself.

1712
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:14,220
If she does, we're both in luck.

1713
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:17,640
No, I'm sorry.

1714
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:19,180
I shouldn't have said it like that.

1715
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:21,060
I don't blame you for thinking I was mad at you.

1716
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:27,600
She's so real.

1717
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:28,940
This is the route meant.

1718
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:30,280
I know, I know!

1719
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:36,120
I didn't mean to sound like I was accusing you of anything.

1720
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:39,200
To be honest, I like make assumptions about other people as
well.

1721
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:40,440
What do you think about me?

1722
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:48,500
She's got such good fashion sense.

1723
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:50,860
I wish she was the blue character though.

1724
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:52,560
Like you know, I wish she was wearing blue.

1725
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:56,980
I'll think things like this guy seems serious.

1726
01:48:57,320 --> 01:48:59,600
He probably does this and that.

1727
01:49:03,460 --> 01:49:04,980
No, it's okay.

1728
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:20,600
I'm pretty dumb huh I don't like it when people did smear
but like I still do it to others no one's perfect you got to

1729
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:34,380
work it I love her hair she's so cute it's kind of like mine
maybe I should wear a side pony I'm kind of inspired right

1730
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:43,300
now her hair is like mine just different colors but I'd
better stop Like, treat others like you'd want to be

1731
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:43,640
treated.

1732
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:45,060
That's what my grandma always said.

1733
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:46,920
She was definitely right.

1734
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:56,840
He's just like me.

1735
01:49:57,720 --> 01:50:01,640
The best way to stop is to learn more about other people.

1736
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:03,320
So I'll start with you, Haight-chan.

1737
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:08,800
By the way, what kind of person do you think I am?

1738
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:27,360
Right now, you're like the kind of person who screwed up and
got fired?

1739
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:30,380
No, I can't let myself make assumptions.

1740
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,240
I need to fix my view.

1741
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:34,460
That's not an assumption.

1742
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:35,720
It's just the truth.

1743
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:39,920
So no matter how much we get to know each other, It won't
change.

1744
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:42,140
Wow, is it already this late?

1745
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:44,540
I'm going to go back really sad and embarrassed.

1746
01:50:44,940 --> 01:50:45,520
Time to go home.

1747
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:52,960
Thank you.

1748
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:53,500
Bye-bye.

1749
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:55,180
Thanks for everything.

1750
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:01,840
I got to drink some delicious alcohol and have fun
conversations.

1751
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:03,540
Now I'm motivated for work.

1752
01:51:06,700 --> 01:51:07,100
Sunday.

1753
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,220
Hmm.

1754
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:12,520
Oh, wait.

1755
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:13,020
Oh, sorry.

1756
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:13,840
Uh, this one.

1757
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:15,320
Let's gamble it.

1758
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:16,260
I'm wearing a gamble.

1759
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:18,400
Oh, big boss.

1760
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:18,960
Big boss.

1761
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:19,820
Big boss.

1762
01:51:19,940 --> 01:51:21,120
Big boss.

1763
01:51:21,420 --> 01:51:21,640
Boss.

1764
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:23,600
Thank you for your boss.

1765
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:24,360
Thank you.

1766
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:24,720
Boss.

1767
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:25,800
Boss.

1768
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:26,700
Boss.

1769
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:27,300
Boss.

1770
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:50,500
Yeah, no, you guys.

1771
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:51,840
I didn't save on purpose.

1772
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:53,460
Because.

1773
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:59,760
because this is real life, okay?

1774
01:52:01,820 --> 01:52:03,400
This is real life.

1775
01:52:03,660 --> 01:52:04,340
Keep rolling.

1776
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:06,440
Okay, one more.

1777
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:09,160
Just one more.

1778
01:52:10,100 --> 01:52:12,880
I wonder what the I sparklies mean.

1779
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:14,200
If they mean anything.

1780
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:16,740
Oh,

1781
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,760
it's only 800 yen.

1782
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:22,920
One more.

1783
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:27,460
Give me the jackpot.

1784
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:28,640
Please!

1785
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,060
Oh god, I'm gonna lose my house!

1786
01:52:31,340 --> 01:52:33,800
Oh god, oh god, oh god!

1787
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,940
Please, the jackpot!

1788
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:38,500
Ah!

1789
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:40,980
Better than nothing.

1790
01:52:55,610 --> 01:52:57,010
Okay, one more.

1791
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:05,720
Oh god, I'm scared!

1792
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:07,340
I can't look, I can't look!

1793
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:08,680
Cha-ching!

1794
01:53:11,140 --> 01:53:11,260
What?

1795
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:13,360
What are these tiny baby amounts?

1796
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:18,260
I mean, not that I'm complaining or anything, but...

1797
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:18,500
What?

1798
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:18,980
One more!

1799
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:19,860
Okay, end on a win.

1800
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:20,960
This is the last one.

1801
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:28,980
Last one, last one, last one, by the power of my bunny ears,
I manifest money into my wallet!

1802
01:54:00,390 --> 01:54:02,310
I think I missed...

1803
01:54:04,870 --> 01:54:05,990
Last, last one?

1804
01:54:06,910 --> 01:54:08,230
You guys, I don't think I can...

1805
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:09,350
I don't think I can recover.

1806
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:12,350
I actually don't think I can financially recover.

1807
01:54:15,130 --> 01:54:16,250
You're right.

1808
01:54:16,550 --> 01:54:17,210
I am.

1809
01:54:18,650 --> 01:54:21,330
This is what it's like when Arona gives you nine blues and
one yellow.

1810
01:55:00,790 --> 01:55:01,690
It's over.

1811
01:55:04,290 --> 01:55:05,610
It's over for me.

1812
01:55:08,590 --> 01:55:11,850
Who wanted to go see the bunny girls anyway?

1813
01:55:14,650 --> 01:55:16,250
Maybe that girl was wrong.

1814
01:55:16,870 --> 01:55:18,270
Maybe my life really is over.

1815
01:55:19,430 --> 01:55:19,770
Maybe.

1816
01:55:23,810 --> 01:55:26,470
Maybe I just should have...

1817
01:55:33,190 --> 01:55:34,290
Wow, wait, anyway.

1818
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:37,510
What a crazy dream we saw right just then, wasn't it?

1819
01:55:37,870 --> 01:55:38,430
Oh, my God.

1820
01:55:38,910 --> 01:55:41,770
You guys, I just had the craziest dream.

1821
01:55:42,490 --> 01:55:43,710
I'm so glad I woke up from that.

1822
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:46,010
I just kept gambling and losing and losing and losing.

1823
01:55:46,690 --> 01:55:48,410
This is why I quit sports, but...

1824
01:55:55,390 --> 01:56:06,150
Oh gosh Anyway I shaved, brushed my teeth and got the
wrinkles out of my clothes I'm good, let's go into this shop

Mm-hmm, oh!

1837
01:57:13,450 --> 01:57:14,690
I like it here.

1838
01:57:16,110 --> 01:57:16,550
Itadakimasu!

1839
01:57:17,150 --> 01:57:19,150
I don't have a present for her or anything.

1840
01:57:20,090 --> 01:57:20,990
Let's just talk.

1841
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:23,230
What do you do on your days off, Dine-chan?

1842
01:57:23,310 --> 01:57:23,390
Wait.

1843
01:57:29,910 --> 01:57:35,350
You asking me on a date?

1844
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:38,050
You're like pretty aggressive, huh, Hai-chan?

1845
01:57:39,150 --> 01:57:40,070
That's not what I meant!

1846
01:57:40,530 --> 01:57:41,570
I really am interested.

1847
01:57:42,090 --> 01:57:49,750
Oh, I think you're very charming.

1848
01:57:51,550 --> 01:57:53,610
I wouldn't come and see you if I didn't.

1849
01:58:06,190 --> 01:58:07,810
It's funny that you think that.

1850
01:58:07,930 --> 01:58:10,450
It's so funny that it's actually a little embarrassing.

1851
01:58:12,250 --> 01:58:15,090
Oh my gosh, she's so cute.

1852
01:58:15,690 --> 01:58:16,550
Thanks, though.

1853
01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:25,910
Anyway, you wanted to know about my days off.

1854
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:27,030
Let's spin this around.

1855
01:58:27,470 --> 01:58:28,550
What do you think I do?

1856
01:58:29,090 --> 01:58:30,930
Oh, okay, I have to judge her.

1857
01:58:32,470 --> 01:58:33,350
I think...

1858
01:58:33,350 --> 01:58:37,510
Okay, she said that she watches anime and she plays games,
so maybe spend time.

1859
01:58:37,670 --> 01:58:40,270
Okay, either shopping for clothes or spend time at home,
right?

1860
01:58:41,790 --> 01:58:42,210
Right?

1861
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:46,530
I think she spends time.

1862
01:58:46,550 --> 01:58:48,430
Spend time at home.

1863
01:58:53,270 --> 01:58:54,350
Spend time at home.

1864
01:58:57,430 --> 01:58:58,410
Oh, you're right!

1865
01:59:02,670 --> 01:59:04,230
That's pretty much it lately.

1866
01:59:04,610 --> 01:59:08,110
I've got like a stack of manga and this season's anime to
catch up on.

1867
01:59:08,710 --> 01:59:09,730
She's so real.

1868
01:59:10,050 --> 01:59:18,690
I love her!

1869
01:59:19,230 --> 01:59:21,530
She also goes to carry karaoke by herself?

1870
01:59:22,350 --> 01:59:25,090
I like went to karaoke in front of the station by myself
last weekend.

1871
01:59:25,450 --> 01:59:27,690
I sang nothing with the songs that I wanted to sing myself.

1872
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:29,490
She's just like me!

1873
01:59:31,870 --> 01:59:34,970
I guess you try to pick the songs that everyone knows when
you go with friends.

1874
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:45,470
Literally me, I am also very cute.

1875
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:46,710
I believe you.

1876
01:59:49,050 --> 01:59:55,670
Yeah, I like hearing people sing but like going with friends
is fun too oh wait so going with friends is fun too but like

1877
01:59:55,670 --> 02:00:09,090

02:00:09,090 --> 02:00:15,990

1879
02:00:16,310 --> 02:00:17,130
Don't say that!

1880
02:00:17,390 --> 02:00:17,970
Hi, doll!

1881
02:00:18,390 --> 02:00:18,630
Oh,

02:00:22,650 --> 02:00:23,170

1883
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:28,490
Well, then,

1884
02:00:32,890 --> 02:00:34,990
why don't I act as your partner?

1885
02:00:45,860 --> 02:00:46,500
Here.

1886
02:00:47,340 --> 02:00:49,240
I'll blow a kiss to you.

1887
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:49,780
Maha!

1888
02:00:50,260 --> 02:00:51,320
That's all for now.

1889
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:53,140
So hang in there, okay?

1890
02:01:02,620 --> 02:01:07,160
Is this what it feels like to go to the afterlife one more
time?

1891
02:01:10,020 --> 02:01:12,540
It's been so long since I knew what it felt like to die.

1892
02:01:16,470 --> 02:01:18,530
Sayonara, sweet world.

1893
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:27,760
Umeshu?

1894
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:29,260
Yeah, let's get some more umeshu.

1895
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:32,180
Have you not had enough to drink?

1896
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:33,180
Look at her face.

1897
02:01:33,300 --> 02:01:34,740
She's so cute.

1898
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:35,780
My goodness.

1899
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:38,100
If you want some more, I can get you some.

1900
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:38,460
Yes.

1901
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:43,960
That's good.

1902
02:01:45,260 --> 02:01:46,220
Umeshu for me?

1903
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:48,840
Umeshu for you?

1904
02:01:56,260 --> 02:02:00,330
Do you believe in life after after life?

1905
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:05,080
Do you believe in life after life?

1906
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:07,900
Itadakimasu.

1907
02:02:09,740 --> 02:02:10,560
Itadakimasu.

1908
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:14,880
Should we get something to eat?

1909
02:02:15,980 --> 02:02:19,580
I love having...

1910
02:02:19,580 --> 02:02:20,820
Where's the mixed nuts?

1911
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:37,620
Izakaya or not Izakaya bars always have like the nuts that
you can have right um give more fries pizza it's expensive

1912
02:02:37,620 --> 02:02:51,540

02:02:57,980 --> 02:03:00,460
This is my favorite, so yummy!

1915
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:00,980
Really?

1916
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:02,180
Hi, I'm...

1917
02:03:02,740 --> 02:03:05,500
Have you got anything you want to do?

1918
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:06,820
You want to do?

1919
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:11,840
I hate pizza, actually.

1920
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:12,520
What?

1921
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:14,420
Why?

1922
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:17,700
Why?

1923
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:19,920
Why?

1924
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:21,000
Why do you hate pizza?

1925
02:03:25,740 --> 02:03:26,420
Yeah.

1926
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:27,220
having fun, Hai-chan.

1927
02:03:27,420 --> 02:03:28,360
Is there something you want to do?

1928
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:30,300
I'll listen if there's anything you want to talk about.

1929
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:32,420
Don't hold back.

1930
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:37,640
Mint's streams have taught me that compulsive gambling and
good alcohol is the real way to a woman's heart.

1931
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:38,220
Thanks, Mint.

1932
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:40,160
I'll take this knowledge to heart.

1933
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:44,680
I'm here to help you learn.

1934
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:48,400
You're being pretty assertive today, Rin-chan.

1935
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:49,420
What's going on?

1936
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:50,200
She's drunk!

1937
02:03:56,500 --> 02:03:59,640
I thought I should try harder to starve my customer...

1938
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:00,080
Well, serve.

1939
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:20,200
Sorry.

1940
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:24,840
Sorry if I read it wrong.

1941
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:33,700
I thought I should try harder to serve my customers well.

1942
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:37,060
That's what they call good service.

1943
02:04:37,220 --> 02:04:37,740
No?

1944
02:04:44,420 --> 02:04:45,920
She's so awesome.

1945
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:51,320
She's so awesome.

1946
02:04:52,140 --> 02:04:53,900
She cares about me, you guys.

1947
02:04:54,140 --> 02:04:55,220
I'm not parasocial.

1948
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:56,560
She cares about me.

1949
02:04:58,220 --> 02:04:59,420
I mean, think about it.

1950
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:02,400
You're spending your own hard-earned money to talk to me.

1951
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:03,180
Oh,

1952
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:14,780
she's so good.

1953
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:19,020
She cares about me.

1954
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:26,440
It's money, money, money that's valued equally all over the
world.

1955
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:27,440
I know I'm a stupid.

1956
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:30,900
And you're using that money to come see me, right?

1957
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:36,620
Are you actually trying to tell us something, Mint?

1958
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:40,200
Is your maid cafe actually a place to starve customers to
turn you into a wist?

1959
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:41,240
No!

1960
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:43,400
Why would you think that?

1961
02:05:54,850 --> 02:05:56,110
It's pretty crazy, right?

1962
02:05:56,390 --> 02:06:00,270
I can't just half-ass things now that I've realized how far
people are willing to go for me.

1963
02:06:00,510 --> 02:06:02,470
I know I've bought her macarons, I've bought her perfume.

1964
02:06:04,250 --> 02:06:20,330
today but to be honest I prefer your usual style of service
Dean Chan what is going on money starve me boss no are you

1965
02:06:20,330 --> 02:06:27,950
kidding my usual style is just me like goofing off I've
never even been consciously providing service until now this

1966
02:06:27,950 --> 02:06:29,270
pose is so goofy

1967
02:06:39,550 --> 02:06:42,430
I can't just accept a paycheck for doing that, can I?

1968
02:06:43,430 --> 02:06:46,470
I need to make sure that I'm entertaining you too, not just
myself.

1969
02:06:47,630 --> 02:06:49,530
Hey, if you're having fun, then I'm having fun too.

1970
02:06:49,810 --> 02:06:53,270
In fact, it wouldn't be as fun for me if you just started
fussing over me.

1971
02:06:57,930 --> 02:07:01,350
True, it's not easy to relax when someone's fussing over
you, huh?

1972
02:07:06,270 --> 02:07:07,930
I'm gonna buy her a big present

1973
02:07:11,070 --> 02:07:13,590
Well, should I just act normal then?

1974
02:07:13,930 --> 02:07:15,590
That'd be easier, more fun for me too.

1975
02:07:16,230 --> 02:07:18,930
Sure, I like you best when you act like you usually do,
Nin-chan.

1976
02:07:19,330 --> 02:07:21,590
You're plenty charming just the way you are, okay?

1977
02:07:22,950 --> 02:07:25,250
We got some good points.

1978
02:07:26,130 --> 02:07:28,090
Yeah, yeah, we're pretty cool.

1979
02:07:31,630 --> 02:07:32,550
She's so cute.

1980
02:07:37,430 --> 02:07:38,510
That's embarrassing.

1981
02:07:38,810 --> 02:07:40,610
Don't say that with such a straight face.

1982
02:07:40,930 --> 02:07:42,670
I hope you'll be able to look you in the eye.

1983
02:07:42,850 --> 02:07:43,970
Oh, she's so cute.

1984
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:44,950
It's Starbus.

1985
02:07:45,110 --> 02:07:46,850
I want to become an internal customer.

1986
02:07:50,630 --> 02:07:51,190
Yeah.

1987
02:07:55,810 --> 02:07:57,410
Oh, I'm not moody.

1988
02:07:57,750 --> 02:07:57,850
No, I'm not moody.

1989
02:07:58,130 --> 02:07:58,910
No, anything.

1990
02:08:02,290 --> 02:08:02,750
Yeah.

1991
02:08:02,850 --> 02:08:03,130
Yeah.

1992
02:08:03,930 --> 02:08:05,550
Let's have...

1993
02:08:05,550 --> 02:08:07,430
What's her favorite, I wonder?

1994
02:08:09,130 --> 02:08:10,930
We're gonna get drunk drunk.

1995
02:08:16,890 --> 02:08:18,590
Bleshingiarus are very effective.

1996
02:08:23,140 --> 02:08:24,420
Thank you!

1997
02:08:24,740 --> 02:08:26,980
I'm being fed so well tonight.

1998
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:32,640
Have you realized you can control the camera when she
reaches for your drink?

1999
02:08:33,380 --> 02:08:34,240
There's a zoom?

2000
02:08:35,820 --> 02:08:37,520
Oh, I didn't know when he told me this before.

2001
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:39,160
Huh?

2002
02:08:45,820 --> 02:08:47,020
Wait, is this real?

2003
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:50,420
Do you have a phone?

2004
02:08:50,600 --> 02:08:53,040
Hi-chan, are there any apps you spend a lot of time on?

2005
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:57,720
Oh, you got games on your phone?

2006
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:02,200
But I don't gamble or anything.

2007
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:04,960
It's real?

2008
02:09:06,980 --> 02:09:08,340
We've been telling you?

2009
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:09,820
I haven't seen!

2010
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:12,600
What do you mean we've been telling you?

2011
02:09:14,020 --> 02:09:15,840
I'm playing the game!

2012
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:20,800
You mean like, are there any games or anything I'd
recommend?

2013
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:31,480
Yeah, but I don't need any more games.

2014
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:34,820
I still have my daily routine.

2015
02:09:35,780 --> 02:09:36,280
do more.

2016
02:09:37,640 --> 02:09:38,920
Something other than games, huh?

2017
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:41,600
Oh, wait, man.

2018
02:09:41,720 --> 02:09:42,520
Wait, I have that?

2019
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:44,060
A map app?

2020
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:46,320
Doesn't every phone have that?

2021
02:09:46,860 --> 02:09:48,200
A photo editing app.

2022
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:50,160
She might like that, right?

2023
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:51,780
Mmm.

2024
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:53,860
Mmm.

2025
02:09:54,860 --> 02:09:55,060
Mmm.

2026
02:09:57,720 --> 02:09:58,800
The day alias.

2027
02:10:00,700 --> 02:10:00,900
Mmm.

2028
02:10:02,580 --> 02:10:03,920
I don't know.

2029
02:10:04,260 --> 02:10:05,120
She might like this, though.

2030
02:10:05,480 --> 02:10:06,360
Photo editing app.

2031
02:10:14,740 --> 02:10:17,600
She's like not into the typical things a gyar would be into.

2032
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:20,640
You know when you like think of a gyar.

2033
02:10:21,260 --> 02:10:24,480
It's just like shopping and makeup and everything like that.

2034
02:10:24,680 --> 02:10:28,540
Like I mean I'm sure she's into it but like you know they
are always heavily editing their stuff.

2035
02:10:29,140 --> 02:10:29,920
Yeah no riz.

2036
02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:32,380
A lot of people use this when they take selfies.

2037
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:34,940
I tried using one once but it was a pain to use to give up.

2038
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:40,320
It's okay, I'll buy her another pizza.

2039
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:45,460
Hai-Tan, did you know people back in the day didn't have
phones at all?

2040
02:10:51,620 --> 02:10:52,820
Isn't that crazy?

2041
02:10:53,260 --> 02:10:55,260
I don't think I could survive if I didn't have my phone.

2042
02:10:56,700 --> 02:10:57,220
Yeah, me too.

2043
02:10:57,340 --> 02:10:59,480
Once you get used to having one, you just can't give it up.

2044
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:01,980
She's so cute.

2045
02:11:06,940 --> 02:11:07,300
Exactly.

2046
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:10,960
Maybe once I get used to me, you won't be able to give me up
either?

2047
02:11:13,420 --> 02:11:17,700
If I get too into you, I might just want to keep you out of
my...

2048
02:11:17,700 --> 02:11:18,220
Haido!

2049
02:11:20,980 --> 02:11:21,780
Are we... We're like zero.

2050
02:11:33,350 --> 02:11:34,790
Seriously, flirting, aren't we?

2051
02:11:37,530 --> 02:11:38,610
Why don't you then?

2052
02:11:38,770 --> 02:11:39,670
In fact, you should.

2053
02:11:40,030 --> 02:11:41,310
Make it so you can't live without me.

2054
02:11:41,590 --> 02:11:43,590
Yeah, that'd be great!

2055
02:11:50,630 --> 02:11:54,970
So from now on, keep getting more and more hooked on me,
okay?

2056
02:12:05,980 --> 02:12:07,540
I'll do my best too!

2057
02:12:07,860 --> 02:12:08,920
Here, I love you!

2058
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:09,980
I love you, Hai-chan!

2059
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:10,940
Muah, muah!

2060
02:12:11,340 --> 02:12:12,380
Come see me more!

2061
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:16,680
Wow, is it already this?

2062
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:17,880
No, Hai-chan!

2063
02:12:19,600 --> 02:12:21,280
No, you were in!

2064
02:12:21,680 --> 02:12:22,200
Don't go!

2065
02:12:30,900 --> 02:12:32,000
You idiot!

2066
02:12:34,140 --> 02:12:34,940
You idiot!

2067
02:12:40,090 --> 02:12:41,630
Thanks for today.

2068
02:12:42,010 --> 02:12:42,550
Bye-bye!

2069
02:12:44,130 --> 02:12:45,250
I can't believe it.

2070
02:12:46,070 --> 02:12:47,370
I'm motivated for work.

2071
02:12:47,750 --> 02:13:02,950
I don't

2072
02:13:14,110 --> 02:13:17,790
know.

2073
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:23,020
Oh, 700 yen.

2074
02:13:24,660 --> 02:13:27,180
It's better than losing!

2075
02:13:27,800 --> 02:13:33,750
I mean, it's technically a win.

2076
02:13:34,570 --> 02:13:34,830
Hold on.

2077
02:13:35,050 --> 02:13:35,850

02:18:26,940 --> 02:18:28,740
You guys, we did good.

2127
02:18:29,080 --> 02:18:29,640
We did good.

2128
02:18:30,760 --> 02:18:31,580
You really did remember?

2129
02:18:31,940 --> 02:18:32,880
Wow, that's crazy.

2130
02:18:33,260 --> 02:18:34,720
I'm like so genuinely happy.

2131
02:18:35,020 --> 02:18:35,700
What should I do?

2132
02:18:36,300 --> 02:18:36,560
Wow,

2133
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:47,720
was I acting kind of clinging just now?

2134
02:18:47,960 --> 02:18:49,280
Like asking if I'm your babe?

2135
02:18:49,500 --> 02:18:50,980
And about past conversations?

2136
02:18:55,300 --> 02:18:56,480
We're going in.

2137
02:18:58,700 --> 02:19:01,740
Yeah, let's go to Kraoki with Lin-chan.

2138
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:04,140
I really didn't mean it like that at all.

2139
02:19:04,440 --> 02:19:06,280
But I can't help it if you think I'm cringe.

2140
02:19:06,300 --> 02:19:07,620
and too self-conscious.

2141
02:19:08,120 --> 02:19:09,060
Nya, cringe.

2142
02:19:11,540 --> 02:19:13,660
I don't think of you that way at all.

2143
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:21,400
Are you sure you should be saying that?

2144
02:19:21,620 --> 02:19:23,080
I get carried away sometimes, you know.

2145
02:19:24,720 --> 02:19:27,440
If I wasn't okay with that, I wouldn't come to visit you,
Nin-chan.

2146
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:30,400
Oh, no, you're okay.

2147
02:19:30,460 --> 02:19:33,560
So, Hi-chan will I make it to my own opinion

2148
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:40,120
She doesn't say that to everybody, you guys.

2149
02:19:40,320 --> 02:19:41,140
She's only saying that to me.

2150
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:43,520
She doesn't say that to everybody, you guys.

2151
02:19:43,700 --> 02:19:44,320
She only said that to me.

2152
02:19:44,640 --> 02:19:46,000
She's- I'm her favorite now!

2153
02:19:47,080 --> 02:19:49,020
In that case, I'll make you my favorite too.

2154
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:50,880
So you'd better keep coming to see me, okay?

2155
02:19:53,820 --> 02:19:55,300
Where's- oh, where?

2156
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:56,360
Where?

2157
02:20:02,340 --> 02:20:03,060
Of course.

2158
02:20:04,940 --> 02:20:05,660
Of course.

2159
02:20:08,300 --> 02:20:11,320
Oh dang, time like totally flies when I'm with you,
Hai-chan.

2160
02:20:11,820 --> 02:20:12,460
What should we do?

2161
02:20:12,760 --> 02:20:14,840
Will you stay with me for a few more rounds?

2162
02:20:16,940 --> 02:20:17,860
I'm so whipped.

2163
02:20:21,360 --> 02:20:22,160
Let's continue.

2164
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:26,180
I'm gonna get...

2165
02:20:26,180 --> 02:20:28,140
Okay, I'm gonna get something cheap for me.

2166
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:32,260
We're gonna get the U-Lang Heibol.

2167
02:20:34,260 --> 02:20:35,580
Because we're gonna get the bottle.

2168
02:20:35,660 --> 02:20:36,220
for her.

2169
02:20:40,100 --> 02:20:41,620
Easy to get drunk.

2170
02:20:44,020 --> 02:20:45,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2171
02:20:45,500 --> 02:20:46,240
Cheap for me.

2172
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:48,380
I know the zoom.

2173
02:20:48,600 --> 02:20:49,060
I know the zoom.

2174
02:20:49,180 --> 02:20:49,660
I know the zoom.

2175
02:20:49,860 --> 02:20:50,620
That's why I'm getting the bottle.

2176
02:20:53,560 --> 02:20:54,360
Of course.

2177
02:21:00,400 --> 02:21:01,400
Okay, here we go.

2178
02:21:01,740 --> 02:21:01,740
Zoom.

2179
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:03,680
Oh.

2180
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:04,400
Oh.

2181
02:21:04,580 --> 02:21:05,420
How do I go down?

2182
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:06,180
Oh, wait.

2183
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:06,820
Ah!

2184
02:21:07,320 --> 02:21:08,480
Control, control, control!

2185
02:21:08,980 --> 02:21:09,180
Yeah!

2186
02:21:33,030 --> 02:21:34,070
Automatically sooner.

2187
02:21:35,830 --> 02:21:37,010
Just a glimpse.

2188
02:21:37,650 --> 02:21:40,090
I'm teasing you guys, I'm teasing you guys.

2189
02:21:40,930 --> 02:21:41,450
Oh,

2190
02:21:44,470 --> 02:21:45,810
I want to go on vacation!

2191
02:21:46,150 --> 02:21:48,330
Wait, is she gonna invite me?

2192
02:21:48,930 --> 02:21:49,650
That sounds nice.

2193
02:21:49,970 --> 02:21:50,710
Where would you want to go?

2194
02:21:50,810 --> 02:21:52,290
A hot spring or maybe somewhere overseas?

2195
02:21:52,870 --> 02:21:54,130
Seychee june leikana?

2196
02:21:58,910 --> 02:22:01,310
You guys, she's so perfect.

2197
02:22:02,510 --> 02:22:05,130
I'm going to go to, like, a nerd-pring pilgrimage.

2198
02:22:05,990 --> 02:22:09,310
I could visit places that inspired settings in anime and
manga.

2199
02:22:09,810 --> 02:22:10,650
She's so good.

2200
02:22:11,270 --> 02:22:12,250
She's so good.

2201
02:22:13,610 --> 02:22:14,890
Yeah, I've heard of that sort of thing.

2202
02:22:15,210 --> 02:22:17,570
Some small towns have been revitalized because of it, right?

2203
02:22:19,430 --> 02:22:20,050
Perfect for real.

2204
02:22:27,070 --> 02:22:27,750
I'm sorry.

2205
02:22:28,150 --> 02:22:30,290
I shouldn't I misjudged her so much.

2206
02:22:30,730 --> 02:22:31,990
She's so perfect.

2207
02:22:32,790 --> 02:22:33,990
She's so good.

2208
02:22:35,050 --> 02:22:39,690
In some places, the producers and local governments
cooperate for collaboration events and stuff.

2209
02:22:43,930 --> 02:22:45,450
I really want to go.

2210
02:22:45,850 --> 02:22:46,930
Will you come with me, Hai-chan?

2211
02:22:48,230 --> 02:22:51,710
I'm interested, but it won't be as fun if I don't know the
anime, will it?

2212
02:22:57,370 --> 02:23:02,410
You gotta take her to Hinami-zawa.

2213
02:23:04,030 --> 02:23:05,310
Oh my gosh.

2214
02:23:05,910 --> 02:23:07,270
Bean-chan with Hinami-zama syndrome?

2215
02:23:08,050 --> 02:23:08,890
Oh la la.

2216
02:23:09,910 --> 02:23:13,770
In that case, I'll enjoy the anime collabs and you can
enjoy...

2217
02:23:16,350 --> 02:23:17,350
What's that mean?

2218
02:23:17,610 --> 02:23:18,790
What do you mean by that?

2219
02:23:22,530 --> 02:23:24,610
What do you mean?

2220
02:23:27,630 --> 02:23:29,530
What do you mean?

2221
02:23:30,210 --> 02:23:31,710
Enjoy you.

2222
02:23:35,490 --> 02:23:40,310
Like, you can enjoy looking at my smiling

2223
02:23:51,710 --> 02:23:57,030
while I eat yummy food, and you can feel my excitement while
I buy all the anime merch.

2224
02:23:57,330 --> 02:23:59,470
Oh, so that's what you meant.

2225
02:24:00,070 --> 02:24:02,130
Going on a trip with you sounds like a lot of fun, Ninjan.

2226
02:24:14,070 --> 02:24:17,770
Oh, were you thinking that I meant something naughty?

2227
02:24:18,250 --> 02:24:21,190
I guess you would imagine that if we were traveling alone.

2228
02:24:23,430 --> 02:24:25,110
No, I didn't.

2229
02:24:25,290 --> 02:24:27,610
I was picturing a normal, wholesome trip.

2230
02:24:32,570 --> 02:24:32,790
Really?

2231
02:24:33,430 --> 02:24:35,610
In that case, I feel kind of defeated.

2232
02:24:36,950 --> 02:24:38,350
Calls for more celebration.

2233
02:24:40,090 --> 02:24:51,690
Well, we need to...

2234
02:24:51,710 --> 02:25:00,170
to get to know each other better before we go on a trip
let's put the idea on hold for now take her to uji and go

2235
02:25:00,170 --> 02:25:01,790
sit on the kumiko bench

2236
02:25:10,490 --> 02:25:23,050
me i'm an otaku but you know i really wish i had someone to
enjoy otaku stuff with it's fun by my myself but it'd be

2237
02:25:23,050 --> 02:25:44,510
even better to share it with someone I'm here isn't there
anyone out there anyone who understands my hobbies and will

2238
02:25:44,510 --> 02:26:00,750
enjoy it with me oh my god she's playing with my heart you
guys need Rin lot wife so true so true she's so perfect

2239
02:26:00,750 --> 02:26:12,510
let's battle again let's just go for that omai show again

2240
02:26:21,100 --> 02:26:23,080
Rin was born for mint.

2241
02:26:23,780 --> 02:26:24,940
She's just like me.

2242
02:26:26,080 --> 02:26:26,440
Oh, oh,

2243
02:26:30,900 --> 02:26:30,900
sorry.

2244
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:32,680
I clicked out of the game on accident.

2245
02:26:38,160 --> 02:26:40,900
I clicked out of the game on accident.

2246
02:26:42,710 --> 02:26:44,130
It's so despised.

2247
02:26:46,610 --> 02:26:47,930
I like the sound effect that it makes.

2248
02:26:51,590 --> 02:26:53,430
I'm going to get demonetized.

2249
02:26:57,350 --> 02:26:57,950
conversation.

2250
02:27:02,710 --> 02:27:04,890
It really was on accident!

2251
02:27:10,300 --> 02:27:11,260
We can't do it anymore.

2252
02:27:11,440 --> 02:27:12,740
I just can't, please, Haichan.

2253
02:27:17,660 --> 02:27:18,900
What can't you handle?

2254
02:27:19,220 --> 02:27:22,220
A new anime, a special version of En-vain.

2255
02:27:23,060 --> 02:27:24,760
I want to see.

2256
02:27:26,140 --> 02:27:28,680
There's a special audio commentary on that.

2257
02:27:35,710 --> 02:27:36,570
I know.

2258
02:27:37,070 --> 02:27:38,250
Not that I can't.

2259
02:27:40,890 --> 02:27:43,870
It's a special edition release of a new anime out.

2260
02:27:44,370 --> 02:27:45,410
I want it!

2261
02:27:45,690 --> 02:27:48,770
It's got audio commentary from the director as a bonus.

2262
02:27:50,290 --> 02:27:50,610
I see.

2263
02:27:50,970 --> 02:27:53,170
Well, if you want it that badly, why don't you buy it?

2264
02:28:02,570 --> 02:28:04,870
Because I already have the regular edition.

2265
02:28:05,310 --> 02:28:07,310
I don't want to buy it again just for the bonus feature.

2266
02:28:09,030 --> 02:28:12,030
Nin-chan, are you a novice otaku or what?

2267
02:28:12,930 --> 02:28:16,530
Everybody knows that you buy at least three copies of the
things that you love.

2268
02:28:18,490 --> 02:28:20,390
Especially, especially for the bonus!

2269
02:28:21,430 --> 02:28:23,810
Nin-chan, this is real.

2270
02:28:26,730 --> 02:28:28,430
Yeah, I think we can buy it for her, though, right?

2271
02:28:28,490 --> 02:28:29,510
From the little rabbit shop?

2272
02:28:40,010 --> 02:28:42,970
But I'm not the type of girl who can just grin and bear it.

2273
02:28:43,210 --> 02:28:46,630
If there's something at what, I can't stop thinking about
it.

2274
02:28:50,930 --> 02:28:54,190
Are you like that too, Hai-chan, or can you hold back?

2275
02:28:55,350 --> 02:28:57,610
I beg my parents to pay for it?

2276
02:28:57,670 --> 02:28:59,490
No, I can't hold back.

2277
02:28:59,510 --> 02:29:01,870
I can't hold back.

2278
02:29:07,990 --> 02:29:08,330
Wait!

2279
02:29:10,130 --> 02:29:10,530
Wait!

2280
02:29:10,990 --> 02:29:12,890
Uh-oh.

2281
02:29:13,230 --> 02:29:13,990
She didn't like it.

2282
02:29:14,050 --> 02:29:14,790
We have no Riz.

2283
02:29:15,210 --> 02:29:16,670
I just wanted to be relatable to her.

2284
02:29:17,770 --> 02:29:18,230
Oh no!

2285
02:29:19,770 --> 02:29:20,170
No.

2286
02:29:22,920 --> 02:29:23,480
Oopsie.

2287
02:29:25,860 --> 02:29:28,300
Is this really the best answer to a hostess?

2288
02:29:29,300 --> 02:29:31,240
I-it's the best answer, I feel.

2289
02:29:31,460 --> 02:29:36,660
Because if, say, she is my fixation, then I'm always going
to be spending on her.

2290
02:29:37,400 --> 02:29:37,640
Right?

2291
02:29:39,080 --> 02:29:39,820
I think?

2292
02:29:40,540 --> 02:29:41,380
That's not how that works.

2293
02:29:43,160 --> 02:29:43,440
Anyway.

2294
02:29:44,280 --> 02:29:44,780
I knew it.

2295
02:29:44,860 --> 02:29:47,120
I think people who can, who can are really amazing.

2296
02:29:47,420 --> 02:29:49,740
But if you don't hold back sometimes, you'll be broke in no
time.

2297
02:29:56,060 --> 02:29:58,100
She's seeing how weak-willed I am.

2298
02:29:58,340 --> 02:29:59,060
You're right.

2299
02:30:00,460 --> 02:30:01,340
I've decided.

2300
02:30:01,460 --> 02:30:02,420
I'll hold back for now.

2301
02:30:02,740 --> 02:30:03,940
I've already have the normal edition.

2302
02:30:04,300 --> 02:30:05,340
I won't waste my money.

2303
02:30:06,300 --> 02:30:08,040
Oh, I guess you can hold back after all, huh?

2304
02:30:15,300 --> 02:30:17,680
I'll at least wait until it goes on sale.

2305
02:30:18,280 --> 02:30:19,740
Once it does, I might crack.

2306
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:28,380
She wants a financially responsible man.

2307
02:30:28,480 --> 02:30:29,680
You're right, you're right.

2308
02:30:31,460 --> 02:30:48,340
really bad I really am bad at holding myself back like that
not just with physical things either what else oh my god I

2309
02:30:48,340 --> 02:30:56,320
can't wait for the arc when Rin shows up at my house at 3 a
.m like if I had someone I liked even if they were super far

2310
02:30:56,320 --> 02:31:00,760
away if I wanted to see them I'd like go right away Even
late at night.

2311
02:31:02,480 --> 02:31:02,980
That's amazing.

2312
02:31:03,320 --> 02:31:04,680
Have you ever done anything like that before?

2313
02:31:05,260 --> 02:31:05,560
No.

2314
02:31:09,560 --> 02:31:12,000
But I'm sure it's the sort of thing I do.

2315
02:31:13,460 --> 02:31:15,860
I guess you're the type who really devotes themselves to
people, huh?

2316
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:24,740
Oh, well, not exactly.

2317
02:31:25,140 --> 02:31:27,200
I wouldn't go unless I really wanted to see them.

2318
02:31:27,620 --> 02:31:28,140
I don't know.

2319
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:33,740
She's so cute.

2320
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:43,220
Like, thinking about it that way, I guess I'm kind of a pain
in the butt.

2321
02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:46,460
If you bother me, it'd probably be tough for you too, you
know?

2322
02:31:48,180 --> 02:31:49,260
Oh, it's getting wet!

2323
02:31:54,810 --> 02:31:56,330
Haito just leaves.

2324
02:31:56,550 --> 02:31:58,630
And like, the best part...

2325
02:32:00,730 --> 02:32:02,050
Fighting town.

2326
02:32:02,230 --> 02:32:02,870
This guy.

2327
02:32:03,430 --> 02:32:04,770
I can't stand him.

2328
02:32:05,890 --> 02:32:06,770
I'm motivated.

2329
02:32:07,710 --> 02:32:08,950
I'm motivated.

2330
02:32:10,990 --> 02:32:11,510
Sunday.

2331
02:32:31,430 --> 02:32:34,070
Didn't you guys say that the gambling seems safer?

2332
02:32:36,510 --> 02:32:39,690
Didn't you guys say that the gambling seems safer?

2333
02:32:42,670 --> 02:32:44,050
It's safer!

2334
02:32:46,310 --> 02:32:48,310
Oh my gosh, you guys, we did it!

2335
02:33:06,330 --> 02:33:08,450
We can't vacation yet.

2336
02:33:09,550 --> 02:33:10,890
Look how cute she is, though.

2337
02:33:11,430 --> 02:33:12,710
Yes, yes, yes.

2338
02:33:13,150 --> 02:33:13,890
They're all cute.

2339
02:33:14,610 --> 02:33:15,410
But Ninjan.

2340
02:33:16,290 --> 02:33:17,410
Ninjan now.

2341
02:33:21,800 --> 02:33:23,200
They don't have it yet.

2342
02:33:25,100 --> 02:33:26,720
Let's get her some socks.

2343
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:31,480
Oh, yeah, let's save too.

2344
02:33:32,780 --> 02:33:33,100
Okay.

2345
02:33:33,900 --> 02:33:34,600
Okay.

2346
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:35,580
Okay.

2347
02:33:35,960 --> 02:33:36,720
Okay.

2348
02:33:39,200 --> 02:33:39,920
Let's go!

2349
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:43,420
Now is my time to rest and recover.

2350
02:33:43,640 --> 02:33:45,760
This is the only place that can heal my mind.

2351
02:33:46,800 --> 02:33:47,640
Healing my mind.

2352
02:33:48,940 --> 02:33:49,280
Hello.

2353
02:33:55,620 --> 02:33:57,600
When do we get to like... I've seen...

2354
02:33:58,080 --> 02:34:00,260
I've seen some stuff where like you can take pictures.

2355
02:34:00,520 --> 02:34:01,580
I mean, obviously there's the album.

2356
02:34:02,520 --> 02:34:04,700
When do I get taking... when do I get to take pictures with
you?

2357
02:34:11,960 --> 02:34:14,220
Alright, thanks for the time gift.

2358
02:34:14,540 --> 02:34:15,620
Thank you.

2359
02:34:16,340 --> 02:34:17,000
Thank you.

2360
02:34:17,380 --> 02:34:20,640
Thank you.

2361
02:34:20,640 --> 02:34:24,430
Okay, bunny patch.

2362
02:34:24,730 --> 02:34:25,210
Okay, bunny patch.

2363
02:34:25,210 --> 02:34:25,210
Mmm.

2364
02:34:27,810 --> 02:34:27,870
Mmm.

2365
02:34:28,190 --> 02:34:28,190
Mmm.

2366
02:34:30,710 --> 02:34:32,590
Checkies are first, if I remember correctly.

2367
02:34:32,710 --> 02:34:32,870
Okay.

2368
02:34:33,410 --> 02:34:34,090
Should be soon.

2369
02:34:34,410 --> 02:34:34,730
Oh!

2370
02:34:35,330 --> 02:34:35,410
Oh!

2371
02:34:35,410 --> 02:34:38,770
I forgot about those.

2372
02:34:38,870 --> 02:34:39,210
Zoom.

2373
02:34:39,390 --> 02:34:40,340
My bad.

2374
02:34:43,270 --> 02:34:43,880
I'll give you.

2375
02:34:47,960 --> 02:34:49,070
Asa Masisa.

2376
02:34:49,490 --> 02:34:51,730
Mm-mm-mm.

2377
02:34:55,190 --> 02:35:04,030
Picture time is when Rin decides it's picture time.

2378
02:35:04,650 --> 02:35:06,090
So true, she can do whatever she wants.

2379
02:35:07,010 --> 02:35:08,510
You know blood type personality theory?

2380
02:35:08,770 --> 02:35:09,670
That stuff's so ridiculous.

2381
02:35:09,970 --> 02:35:10,740
Do you believe in it?

2382
02:35:11,750 --> 02:35:13,330
I never thought that deeply about it before.

2383
02:35:26,470 --> 02:35:29,430
Like, you're type A, so you're very methodical.

2384
02:35:29,950 --> 02:35:30,650
It's so dumb.

2385
02:35:30,990 --> 02:35:32,430
There's millions of people with type A.

2386
02:35:32,750 --> 02:35:34,010
They aren't all the same.

2387
02:35:34,470 --> 02:35:37,150
Oh, I wonder, is it some kind of trend?

2388
02:35:39,530 --> 02:35:41,290
It makes sense, though.

2389
02:35:44,550 --> 02:35:47,170
Going along with that trend, what type do you think I am?

2390
02:35:47,370 --> 02:35:47,990
Go on, guess!

2391
02:35:50,310 --> 02:35:53,350
Wait, I don't know blood types at all.

2392
02:35:54,470 --> 02:35:55,010
Uh...

2393
02:35:55,930 --> 02:35:56,470
Uh...

2394
02:35:59,870 --> 02:36:00,410
Um...

2395
02:36:00,410 --> 02:36:02,130
Oh, it's rare, right?

2396
02:36:04,170 --> 02:36:04,710
So...

2397
02:36:05,330 --> 02:36:05,870
Hmm...

2398
02:36:06,930 --> 02:36:07,470
Hmm...

2399
02:36:11,190 --> 02:36:11,670
Oh?

2400
02:36:18,510 --> 02:36:19,370
Don't call her A.

2401
02:36:19,630 --> 02:36:22,170
Yeah, I don't think calling her A would be good, right?

2402
02:36:22,610 --> 02:36:24,150
I do wonder, though.

2403
02:36:25,430 --> 02:36:25,590
Um.

2404
02:36:28,090 --> 02:36:32,610
I do wonder if, like, how badly you can mess up with these
girls.

2405
02:36:33,990 --> 02:36:40,570
Once I, like, play the game, I want to, like, do a fail run
where I, like, I'm so, so bad with them.

2406
02:36:40,930 --> 02:36:41,170
Okay.

2407
02:36:41,570 --> 02:36:42,810
Let's try Type O.

2408
02:36:43,190 --> 02:36:43,410
Oh.

2409
02:36:55,070 --> 02:36:56,930
She doesn't want to be called type O.

2410
02:36:57,290 --> 02:37:01,370
Isn't that like the rare one that people really want to be?

2411
02:37:03,830 --> 02:37:05,570
What were type O supposed to be again?

2412
02:37:05,730 --> 02:37:06,530
Layed back or something?

2413
02:37:06,950 --> 02:37:08,830
Well, I guess it's true that I don't sweat the small stuff.

2414
02:37:10,510 --> 02:37:11,150
B-gata.

2415
02:37:13,690 --> 02:37:15,830
Oh, really?

2416
02:37:16,530 --> 02:37:26,630
Oh, it can donate to anyone.

2417
02:37:27,330 --> 02:37:29,070
Oh, it was the most common.

2418
02:37:30,170 --> 02:37:30,570
What is?

2419
02:37:32,650 --> 02:37:34,070
Mmm, I'm like it.

2420
02:37:34,890 --> 02:37:35,710
I'm like it.

2421
02:37:36,330 --> 02:37:36,870
I'm like it.

2422
02:37:38,830 --> 02:37:40,210
Yeah, it wasn't even an option.

2423
02:37:40,450 --> 02:37:44,390
Maybe she wanted to be called type A because she says she's
methodical.

2424
02:37:44,750 --> 02:37:46,950
So maybe she wanted us to also see that she's methodical.

2425
02:37:55,250 --> 02:37:57,210
Do you guys know your blood type?

2426
02:37:57,530 --> 02:38:02,650
Actually, I will, I don't have blood, but I don't even know
what I would be.

2427
02:38:06,090 --> 02:38:08,750
I don't think, I don't think I ever was told before.

2428
02:38:08,750 --> 02:38:09,750
Hmm.

2429
02:38:12,700 --> 02:38:13,260
Don't.

2430
02:38:13,340 --> 02:38:13,980
Mine is O.

2431
02:38:14,380 --> 02:38:14,680
O?

2432
02:38:15,300 --> 02:38:16,140
O plus.

2433
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:17,400
I'm O plus.

2434
02:38:17,640 --> 02:38:18,440
I think I'm A.

2435
02:38:21,240 --> 02:38:22,960
What ectoplasm type are you?

2436
02:38:24,420 --> 02:38:25,320
Probably E.

2437
02:38:28,260 --> 02:38:31,080
It's like I've got the personality traits of all the blood
types.

2438
02:38:31,460 --> 02:38:34,000
So blood type personality theory isn't reliable at all.

2439
02:38:34,900 --> 02:38:38,100
I think more than a few people would agree if you put it to
them like that.

2440
02:38:38,400 --> 02:38:38,840
True.

2441
02:38:47,620 --> 02:38:52,900
They say that type A's, oh, I'm sorry to get silly.

2442
02:38:53,320 --> 02:38:55,100
And type B's aren't compatible, right?

2443
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:58,360
But my little brother and sister are type A, and we get
along great.

2444
02:39:01,020 --> 02:39:02,600
What's your blood type, Hai-chan?

2445
02:39:03,140 --> 02:39:04,100
I'm type O.

2446
02:39:11,450 --> 02:39:12,230
There's no way.

2447
02:39:12,250 --> 02:39:13,870
this many of you were type O.

2448
02:39:18,150 --> 02:39:19,750
E, yeah I'm type E.

2449
02:39:23,750 --> 02:39:26,970
How compatible were type B and type O supposed to be again?

2450
02:39:28,550 --> 02:39:30,530
You don't believe in it, but you're still curious?

2451
02:39:34,430 --> 02:39:38,410
I like this face a lot.

2452
02:39:39,530 --> 02:39:40,730
I like this face a lot.

2453
02:39:42,930 --> 02:39:45,270
I was just wondering about how compatible we are.

2454
02:39:45,850 --> 02:39:46,850
It's just on my mind a bit.

2455
02:39:46,970 --> 02:39:47,610
That's all.

2456
02:39:51,430 --> 02:39:58,430
I don't believe in it much, but if the two of us were
compatible, it'd make me happy.

2457
02:40:02,150 --> 02:40:04,810
Why is this game making me feel things?

2458
02:40:09,190 --> 02:40:09,670
Extend.

2459
02:40:12,130 --> 02:40:14,310
She's making... She's just so cute!

2460
02:40:14,730 --> 02:40:15,770
She's just so cute!

2461
02:40:20,750 --> 02:40:22,350
What did I get for her before?

2462
02:40:22,590 --> 02:40:23,170
I don't remember.

2463
02:40:25,970 --> 02:40:26,230
You know what?

2464
02:40:26,450 --> 02:40:27,830
Let's try...

2465
02:40:29,950 --> 02:40:31,910
Let's try a wine for both of us.

2466
02:40:34,010 --> 02:40:34,870
Wine, wine, wine.

2467
02:40:34,970 --> 02:40:36,890
I should probably try all the drinks, right?

2468
02:40:38,950 --> 02:40:40,190
She likes it too, though.

2469
02:40:40,610 --> 02:40:41,090
Good, good.

2470
02:40:43,150 --> 02:40:44,610
In Japan, A is most common.

2471
02:40:44,810 --> 02:40:45,170
Oh, really?

2472
02:40:45,850 --> 02:40:50,530
I didn't even see a single bit.

2473
02:40:51,830 --> 02:40:54,330
Wow, fancy wine.

2474
02:41:02,840 --> 02:41:04,220
I want to get better gaming.

2475
02:41:04,560 --> 02:41:05,740
I'm so sick of losing.

2476
02:41:06,080 --> 02:41:07,400
It's been stressing me out.

2477
02:41:08,300 --> 02:41:18,340
According to the NHS, people are O plus 35, O minus 13, A
plus 30, A minus 8, B plus 8, minus 2.

2478
02:41:19,200 --> 02:41:21,920
AB plus 2% AB minus 1.

2479
02:41:22,260 --> 02:41:22,640
Wow.

2480
02:41:24,300 --> 02:41:31,840
I always thought that O was the most rare, but I guess it's
because it's, uh, it's, maybe I was just thinking of it

2481
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:36,920
being, um, compatible with, like, if you're O type, you can
give blood to anybody, right?

2482
02:41:39,720 --> 02:41:40,960
Ah, I know what you mean.

2483
02:41:41,320 --> 02:41:43,900
Competitive games are fun, but losing too much can be a
bummer.

2484
02:41:50,300 --> 02:41:52,200
Hi Chen, I don't want to lose anymore.

2485
02:41:52,520 --> 02:41:53,960
How can I get better at video games?

2486
02:41:56,780 --> 02:41:57,660
Try it.

2487
02:41:57,820 --> 02:41:58,320
Oh, gosh.

2488
02:41:59,340 --> 02:42:01,120
Um, cheap tricks.

2489
02:42:11,830 --> 02:42:15,190
I think if I tell her to get good, she'll be upset.

2490
02:42:19,280 --> 02:42:19,560
Right?

2491
02:42:19,700 --> 02:42:20,280
I don't know.

2492
02:42:24,360 --> 02:42:25,060
I don't know.

2493
02:42:27,780 --> 02:42:29,140
Get good, get good.

2494
02:42:29,200 --> 02:42:31,700
Okay, we'll tell her to get good.

2495
02:42:33,260 --> 02:42:34,300
You just gotta practice.

2496
02:42:35,900 --> 02:42:37,440
Why do I listen to you guys?

2497
02:42:41,880 --> 02:42:46,100
You don't understand the way to a girl's heart at all.

2498
02:42:48,920 --> 02:42:52,400
You don't understand the way to a girl's heart at all.

2499
02:42:54,180 --> 02:42:55,840
Oh my gosh.

2500
02:43:00,880 --> 02:43:01,880
I knew it.

2501
02:43:02,400 --> 02:43:04,180
It's like that with everything, not just games.

2502
02:43:04,600 --> 02:43:06,260
The only way to get stronger is work hard.

2503
02:43:06,380 --> 02:43:12,040
Oh my gosh, that's like so many responses in a row that we
haven't gotten any hearts on, you guys.

2504
02:43:13,760 --> 02:43:14,920
What games do you play, Rin-chan?

2505
02:43:18,840 --> 02:43:26,100
Oh, I mean, have you ever heard of a simple game series?

2506
02:43:26,760 --> 02:43:33,240
It's like kind of popular, but, you know, of it because
you're gamer and all.

2507
02:43:37,960 --> 02:43:40,580
Do you think she plays Valorant?

2508
02:43:43,720 --> 02:43:46,160
Because losing can get stressful, I've had some problems.

2509
02:43:47,180 --> 02:43:47,480
Problems?

2510
02:43:52,060 --> 02:43:54,440
Sometimes when I lose, I scream.

2511
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:00,240
I scream.

2512
02:44:02,840 --> 02:44:05,560
Like, oh, or...

2513
02:44:06,440 --> 02:44:06,840
No!

2514
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:12,980
She's got the gamer rage.

2515
02:44:15,420 --> 02:44:19,140
If I keep losing like this, I'll get kicked out of my house
for making too much noise.

2516
02:44:20,140 --> 02:44:21,320
That's certainly a big problem.

2517
02:44:21,820 --> 02:44:24,260
You'd better turn your losing streak around soon.

2518
02:44:27,420 --> 02:44:29,100
She should be a VTuber.

2519
02:44:29,500 --> 02:44:29,920
It's true.

2520
02:44:31,320 --> 02:44:32,400
No, she's cute.

2521
02:44:32,580 --> 02:44:33,680
She's too cute though.

2522
02:44:34,200 --> 02:44:35,360
She's too cute though.

2523
02:44:36,360 --> 02:44:36,720
You know?

2524
02:44:37,540 --> 02:44:39,600
She should be an actual streamer.

2525
02:44:39,880 --> 02:44:40,580
Not a VTuber.

2526
02:44:43,480 --> 02:44:44,240
Oh, but hang on.

2527
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:46,960
Even if I win, I might still yell out loud.

2528
02:44:47,300 --> 02:44:47,780
Yata!

2529
02:44:53,630 --> 02:44:54,110
Oh yeah!

2530
02:44:54,710 --> 02:44:56,750
Or, take that, suckers!

2531
02:44:58,850 --> 02:44:59,890
VTubers are cute.

2532
02:45:00,010 --> 02:45:00,930
VTubers are cute too?

2533
02:45:01,610 --> 02:45:03,690
I mean, but like...

2534
02:45:04,690 --> 02:45:05,650
But like...

2535
02:45:06,870 --> 02:45:10,810
Isn't it nicer that us ugly people can become VTubers too?

2536
02:45:15,760 --> 02:45:22,620
And then when all the attractive people, you know, there's
like some VTubers that also like show their faces and stuff.

2537
02:45:27,500 --> 02:45:28,580
Must be nice, huh?

2538
02:45:29,100 --> 02:45:35,200
Must be nice to be a cute anime girl and also be able to
turn into a cute human.

2539
02:45:36,320 --> 02:45:37,100
Must be nice.

2540
02:45:40,140 --> 02:45:40,520
Nice.

2541
02:45:44,980 --> 02:45:46,460
But honestly, I don't mind.

2542
02:45:46,960 --> 02:45:50,780
Because as long as I get to look at cute things, I don't
care how I look.

2543
02:45:52,520 --> 02:45:55,420
I don't care how I look as long as I get to look at cute
things.

2544
02:45:56,260 --> 02:45:58,340
Maybe it'd be better if you soundproofed your room.

2545
02:45:58,400 --> 02:46:00,820
Oh, sake.

2546
02:46:04,620 --> 02:46:07,280
What do we not try?

2547
02:46:07,540 --> 02:46:08,960
I wonder if she's kind of weirdo.

2548
02:46:09,060 --> 02:46:10,120
Does she like the bunny mask?

2549
02:46:11,240 --> 02:46:13,480
Here, I'll just get my... I'll get a beer.

2550
02:46:13,720 --> 02:46:16,080
Or maybe she'll... Here, let's try a beer.

2551
02:46:16,980 --> 02:46:18,840
Actually, no, I want to try the Bunny Max.

2552
02:46:22,520 --> 02:46:23,840
Oh, she likes it!

2553
02:46:24,160 --> 02:46:26,080
But not like, liked it, liked it.

2554
02:46:29,910 --> 02:46:31,110
Choo-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-y!

2555
02:46:33,270 --> 02:46:33,730
Itadakimasu!

2556
02:46:34,590 --> 02:46:35,050
Itadakimasu!

2557
02:46:39,100 --> 02:46:40,580
Um, okay, come for that.

2558
02:46:41,740 --> 02:46:42,560
Hi-chan-wa...

2559
02:47:03,030 --> 02:47:09,690
I keep making a bit of an assumption like you like me how
but you keep coming to see me so at least you don't hate me

2560
02:47:09,690 --> 02:47:17,230
right hey Mint are you winning so far I don't know actually
I can't tell I think she likes me though right I think she

2561
02:47:17,230 --> 02:47:31,010
likes me though right of course I don't hate you but if you
ask me which part of you I like which

2562
02:47:34,200 --> 02:47:42,960
part is a coco which part is cocoa which part is cocoa which
part do you mean cocoa get a good luck here or maybe here

2563
02:47:42,960 --> 02:47:46,620
maybe you like this part I don't know

2564
02:47:55,950 --> 02:47:57,490
She's so cute!

2565
02:47:58,270 --> 02:47:58,610
What's wrong?

2566
02:47:58,790 --> 02:47:59,570
Are you embarrassed?

2567
02:47:59,950 --> 02:48:00,890
Doesn't that seem backwards?

2568
02:48:01,210 --> 02:48:03,070
I'm the one who's embarrassed.

2569
02:48:04,370 --> 02:48:05,090
Cocoa's cute!

2570
02:48:13,630 --> 02:48:15,070
Hurry up and answer!

2571
02:48:15,510 --> 02:48:15,650
Where do you like?

2572
02:48:15,650 --> 02:48:17,250
What part of me do you like?

2573
02:48:17,830 --> 02:48:19,970
Oh, your personality!

2574
02:48:21,190 --> 02:48:23,710
You keep your guard down so it's easy to talk to you,
Rinchan.

2575
02:48:37,070 --> 02:48:40,590
I'm asking you, which part of me is sexy?

2576
02:48:41,210 --> 02:48:44,550
This part or here, but you're saying you like my
personality?

2577
02:48:44,850 --> 02:48:45,830
She seems kind of upset.

2578
02:48:46,570 --> 02:48:49,730
I'm passing

2579
02:48:53,400 --> 02:48:54,020
away.

2580
02:49:01,160 --> 02:49:02,700
She's so cute.

2581
02:49:03,900 --> 02:49:04,520
This is no fair.

2582
02:49:05,060 --> 02:49:06,260
I'm really starting to feel embarrassed.

2583
02:49:06,620 --> 02:49:08,380
How did you turn the situation around like that?

2584
02:49:16,600 --> 02:49:17,540
W-Riz?

2585
02:49:20,600 --> 02:49:22,200
Still made me happy.

2586
02:49:23,060 --> 02:49:26,720
So you hang out with me because you like my personality.

2587
02:49:28,920 --> 02:49:30,520
When it gets away.

2588
02:49:31,020 --> 02:49:31,580
Time to go.

2589
02:49:33,960 --> 02:49:37,360
Oh, Hayato, you dummy, dummy, dumb, dumb, dummy, dumb.

2590
02:49:42,600 --> 02:49:43,980
See you soon.

2591
02:49:47,300 --> 02:49:47,940
Motivated.

2592
02:49:49,760 --> 02:49:50,800
Motivation up.

2593
02:49:51,440 --> 02:49:52,260
I hope I get a bonus.

2594
02:49:52,840 --> 02:49:55,100
Give me more money so I can spend it on her.

2595
02:49:59,820 --> 02:50:01,220
Oh, Hatta.

2596
02:50:13,270 --> 02:50:14,130
This guy.

2597
02:50:14,690 --> 02:50:19,010
I has like zero Riz for real.

2598
02:50:23,100 --> 02:50:25,860
He is so funny.

2599
02:50:26,400 --> 02:50:30,000
It's like right as it's starting to get steamy, he's like,
got a dip.

2600
02:50:33,200 --> 02:50:34,700
Oh my god.

2601
02:50:38,200 --> 02:50:38,960
The money.

2602
02:50:39,280 --> 02:50:40,200
I mean, we got the money.

2603
02:50:40,460 --> 02:50:40,860
We won.

2604
02:50:41,080 --> 02:50:41,700
Oh, oh shit.

2605
02:50:41,780 --> 02:50:42,660
Why did I say yes again?

2606
02:50:42,900 --> 02:50:43,520
I'm such a idiot.

2607
02:50:43,800 --> 02:50:44,800
Why did I say yes again?

2608
02:50:45,160 --> 02:50:46,140
Why did I say yes again?

2609
02:50:46,280 --> 02:50:47,200
I meant to exit out.

2610
02:50:49,280 --> 02:50:50,200
accident.

2611
02:51:05,640 --> 02:51:05,660
Rich.

2612
02:51:08,500 --> 02:51:09,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2613
02:51:12,540 --> 02:51:13,460
Yata.

2614
02:51:14,440 --> 02:51:14,900
Yata.

2615
02:51:17,800 --> 02:51:21,020
You think she would want a wristwatch?

2616
02:51:23,800 --> 02:51:24,260
Hmm.

2617
02:51:25,080 --> 02:51:27,760
Or some more macarons because they're delicious.

2618
02:51:38,220 --> 02:51:39,260
Hot dog!

2619
02:51:41,630 --> 02:51:43,030
There's also the makeup set.

2620
02:51:45,430 --> 02:51:45,550
Hmm.

2621
02:51:46,890 --> 02:51:47,310
Hmm.

2622
02:51:51,390 --> 02:51:53,990
Rin starts to lean into Haito and he high tails it.

2623
02:51:54,130 --> 02:51:55,770
He's just like me for real for real.

2624
02:51:56,030 --> 02:51:56,590
For real.

2625
02:52:01,410 --> 02:52:02,450
One more?

2626
02:52:02,930 --> 02:52:04,010
The luxury bag.

2627
02:52:04,710 --> 02:52:06,390
Oh my god, I'll have no money.

2628
02:52:06,970 --> 02:52:08,970
I'll have no money.

2629
02:52:10,950 --> 02:52:12,550
Pajamas, I already got her that.

2630
02:52:17,840 --> 02:52:20,900
She likes toys, so like plushies, right?

2631
02:52:23,980 --> 02:52:25,000
Let's get her the plushie.

2632
02:52:25,140 --> 02:52:25,400
It's cute.

2633
02:52:29,910 --> 02:52:31,410
Shun Tsui, thank you for the gift.

2634
02:52:31,550 --> 02:52:32,130
Thank you.

2635
02:52:33,150 --> 02:52:34,010
What should I drink today?

2636
02:52:34,250 --> 02:52:35,270
Beer, wine, champagne?

2637
02:52:35,690 --> 02:52:36,990
Let's just get in there first.

2638
02:52:37,730 --> 02:52:37,910
Oh!

2639
02:52:47,150 --> 02:52:47,570
Kaid.

2640
02:53:01,850 --> 02:53:02,790
Chat froze?

2641
02:53:03,210 --> 02:53:05,270
Oh, let me see if I can fix it.

2642
02:53:08,270 --> 02:53:09,770
There you guys are.

2643
02:53:10,370 --> 02:53:11,850
It's her day off, you guys.

2644
02:53:13,410 --> 02:53:14,670
It's her day off.

2645
02:53:16,430 --> 02:53:18,070
Give me the cash, sis.

2646
02:53:19,170 --> 02:53:22,210
Actually, I'll get the oolong highball.

2647
02:53:29,250 --> 02:53:30,890
You can get the cash.

2648
02:53:32,670 --> 02:53:33,410
Actually, no.

2649
02:53:37,950 --> 02:53:39,250
Wait, I wanted to go home.

2650
02:53:41,450 --> 02:53:42,350
I wanted to go home.

2651
02:53:42,490 --> 02:53:44,530
I should have...

2652
02:53:44,530 --> 02:53:48,450
I should have just bought the drink for her and then didn't
extend my time.

2653
02:53:49,430 --> 02:53:50,810
I'm wasting my money, guys.

2654
02:53:51,310 --> 02:53:51,970
Oh well.

2655
02:53:53,810 --> 02:53:55,490
What do you like to do on your days off?

2656
02:54:01,430 --> 02:54:02,530
She's cute though.

2657
02:54:03,830 --> 02:54:04,470
That sounds nice.

2658
02:54:05,110 --> 02:54:06,610
Is there a big age gap between you and your sister?

2659
02:54:06,750 --> 02:54:10,550
Oh, she likes to go to the park with her sister is what she
said.

2660
02:54:12,970 --> 02:54:16,290
Oh, she's still a second grader in elementary school.

2661
02:54:19,410 --> 02:54:20,510
Wow, that's a big difference.

2662
02:54:20,830 --> 02:54:22,290
What kind of games do you play with your sister?

2663
02:54:22,470 --> 02:54:25,070
Hide and seek.

2664
02:54:27,150 --> 02:54:28,950
Ah, you must be, you two must be close.

2665
02:54:32,450 --> 02:54:33,690
Because I'm the only one.

2666
02:54:34,190 --> 02:54:35,090
What do you mean by that?

2667
02:54:35,590 --> 02:54:38,570
Oh, what do you mean by that?

2668
02:54:53,260 --> 02:54:55,320
I think, I think Miyuka's trauma dumping on me.

2669
02:54:55,420 --> 02:54:56,000
Just a little bit.

2670
02:54:56,400 --> 02:54:56,760
No.

2671
02:54:57,200 --> 02:55:00,720
I mean, I guess I kind of asked, right?

2672
02:55:03,520 --> 02:55:06,460
But my parents died in an accident.

2673
02:55:06,980 --> 02:55:09,640
I'm the only one my little sister Moika has.

2674
02:55:11,040 --> 02:55:11,920
I didn't know.

2675
02:55:12,020 --> 02:55:12,800
I'm so sorry.

2676
02:55:13,180 --> 02:55:13,720
I'm so sorry.

2677
02:55:14,220 --> 02:55:15,020
Oh, thank you for the raid.

2678
02:55:15,120 --> 02:55:15,600
Thank you.

2679
02:55:17,240 --> 02:55:18,200
Yeah, it's okay.

2680
02:55:20,400 --> 02:55:22,540
Is it hard living together just the two of you?

2681
02:55:22,860 --> 02:55:23,460
I don't...

2682
02:55:23,460 --> 02:55:24,460
Maybe they're not lonely.

2683
02:55:24,560 --> 02:55:25,160
I don't want to say that.

2684
02:55:26,160 --> 02:55:26,760
Is it hard living?

2685
02:55:32,460 --> 02:55:32,980
Yeah,

2686
02:55:36,740 --> 02:55:38,080
more so for Moika than I.

2687
02:55:38,660 --> 02:55:39,880
I feel so sorry for her.

2688
02:55:41,020 --> 02:55:42,800
I can help you.

2689
02:55:43,260 --> 02:55:44,380
What do you mean by that?

2690
02:55:47,520 --> 02:55:48,800
You're the foundation.

2691
02:55:49,440 --> 02:55:51,680
So you're the foundation of her life.

2692
02:55:54,500 --> 02:55:54,700
What?

2693
02:55:57,520 --> 02:55:58,860
Ducky, thanks for the gifted!

2694
02:55:59,200 --> 02:56:00,320
Andrew goes, thanks for the 10 gifted!

2695
02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:05,640
Yes, there's no one else I can turn to.

2696
02:56:06,420 --> 02:56:07,100
That's unbelievable.

2697
02:56:07,460 --> 02:56:09,020
I admire you for doing that.

2698
02:56:14,400 --> 02:56:15,580
It's not unbelievable.

2699
02:56:16,320 --> 02:56:17,220
I just live.

2700
02:56:18,660 --> 02:56:19,740
The two of us.

2701
02:56:19,840 --> 02:56:22,500
The two of us.

2702
02:56:27,240 --> 02:56:29,520
Um, I think the vibes have been...

2703
02:56:31,320 --> 02:56:32,880
Ruby, thank you for the pipe, gifted!

2704
02:56:35,180 --> 02:56:35,740
Um...

2705
02:56:35,740 --> 02:56:36,260
See ya!

2706
02:56:40,460 --> 02:56:41,500
See ya later!

2707
02:56:42,020 --> 02:56:44,280
Bye bye!

2708
02:56:45,320 --> 02:56:46,380
Thanks for everything!

2709
02:56:46,760 --> 02:56:49,380
Oh, they don't see me out the door because I didn't spend
enough money.

2710
02:56:50,740 --> 02:56:51,380
Okay, ninja!

2711
02:56:52,680 --> 02:56:53,880
Min-chan!

2712
02:57:06,160 --> 02:57:07,780
I feel bad now though.

2713
02:57:09,640 --> 02:57:11,280
Don't worry about it.

2714
02:57:12,380 --> 02:57:13,580
Drink to forget it.

2715
02:57:14,020 --> 02:57:15,100
Don't worry about it.

2716
02:57:15,260 --> 02:57:17,100
We're just, uh...

2717
02:57:17,100 --> 02:57:19,880
We're just getting rich, baby!

2718
02:57:22,480 --> 02:57:23,160
Yeah!

2719
02:57:26,060 --> 02:57:27,320
Oh man.

2720
02:57:27,960 --> 02:57:29,520
I'm gonna buy her a good bottle.

2721
02:57:30,240 --> 02:57:31,620
I'm gonna buy her the bottle.

2722
02:57:45,510 --> 02:57:51,590
Get me a special highball.

2723
02:57:52,890 --> 02:57:53,770
Of course.

2724
02:57:55,270 --> 02:57:57,730
Let's get her the big shampoo.

2725
02:57:57,850 --> 02:58:02,330
So if I get this really expensive one, is her skirt just
gonna fly off?

2726
02:58:02,430 --> 02:58:04,630
Is it just gonna go, is it gonna like tear into a thousand?

2727
02:58:04,650 --> 02:58:18,430
in pieces she's gonna be like yeah and I'm just like oh oh
this is what money can buy you know I wonder I'm gonna get

2728
02:58:18,430 --> 02:58:21,510
her easy to get drug from it

2729
02:58:27,280 --> 02:58:34,100
okay whoa today they're super they're super

2730
02:58:37,940 --> 02:58:39,260
Zebra print!

2731
02:58:45,980 --> 02:58:48,600
I didn't expect the zebra print.

2732
02:58:51,840 --> 02:58:53,620
Here's the dozo.

2733
02:58:54,980 --> 02:58:57,760
You liked it!

2734
02:58:59,360 --> 02:59:01,380
I'm so happy about this!

2735
02:59:01,440 --> 02:59:04,480
Do you have any siblings, Hai-chan?

2736
02:59:05,260 --> 02:59:06,720
Nope, I'm an only child.

2737
02:59:14,560 --> 02:59:16,180
What did you say to her?

2738
02:59:16,940 --> 02:59:19,700
Why is she suddenly asking about if I have siblings, huh?

2739
02:59:20,100 --> 02:59:24,720
After I talked to you yesterday, Muka, about your sibling.

2740
02:59:28,360 --> 02:59:29,800
What did you tell her?

2741
02:59:29,800 --> 02:59:30,720
What did you tell her?

2742
02:59:36,410 --> 02:59:38,930
You kind of give off an older brother vibe.

2743
02:59:39,050 --> 02:59:41,050
So I thought you must have a little brother or sister.

2744
02:59:41,070 --> 02:59:51,270
As for me, oh yeah, I mentioned it earlier, back when we
were talking about blood types.

2745
02:59:51,370 --> 02:59:52,550
Wait, what did she say?

2746
02:59:55,010 --> 02:59:55,150
Oh!

2747
02:59:59,890 --> 03:00:01,310
They're A-type, they're A-type.

2748
03:00:01,750 --> 03:00:02,530
Do you remember Hi-chan?

2749
03:00:02,850 --> 03:00:05,410
I'll be impressed if you remember my family members' blood
types.

2750
03:00:06,170 --> 03:00:07,870
Um, younger brother,

2751
03:00:11,590 --> 03:00:15,070
sister are both A.

2752
03:00:20,990 --> 03:00:21,710
Wow,

2753
03:00:27,250 --> 03:00:28,470
you like actually remembered?

2754
03:00:28,930 --> 03:00:29,610
What should I do?

2755
03:00:29,910 --> 03:00:32,090
How about a kiss on the cheek as a reward?

2756
03:00:33,810 --> 03:00:34,230
Good.

2757
03:00:41,450 --> 03:00:44,170
I have a little brothers and sisters who are way younger
than me.

2758
03:00:44,450 --> 03:00:45,810
They're both super cute.

2759
03:00:57,150 --> 03:01:01,590
Whenever I visit my parents, they cling to me and call me
big sis, big sis.

2760
03:01:02,110 --> 03:01:04,070
They literally wrap themselves around my legs.

2761
03:01:04,430 --> 03:01:05,590
Toots adorbs, huh?

2762
03:01:06,030 --> 03:01:06,930
We are so in.

2763
03:01:06,990 --> 03:01:08,090
Oh my gosh, she's scared.

2764
03:01:08,290 --> 03:01:08,970
Oh my gosh, you guys.

2765
03:01:09,190 --> 03:01:09,550
Is this?

2766
03:01:09,650 --> 03:01:11,070
She's, I mean, she's talking about her family.

2767
03:01:11,090 --> 03:01:15,910
That's basically like meeting her family, you know?

2768
03:01:16,270 --> 03:01:17,790
We're already on that level.

2769
03:01:18,470 --> 03:01:19,050
Oh my gosh.

2770
03:01:19,810 --> 03:01:22,070
Are you so reliable because you're an older sister,
Nin-chan?

2771
03:01:32,810 --> 03:01:34,510
You think I'm reliable?

2772
03:01:35,650 --> 03:01:35,850
Really?

2773
03:01:36,450 --> 03:01:37,290
That's how you think of me?

2774
03:01:37,690 --> 03:01:38,470
I think I'm blushing.

2775
03:01:44,710 --> 03:01:48,270
But compared to me, Mioka's definitely more of a reliable
big sister.

2776
03:01:48,830 --> 03:01:50,150
Mioka, one of the cast members here?

2777
03:01:50,650 --> 03:01:53,070
Yeah, we're, we're like basically married.

2778
03:01:53,550 --> 03:01:54,050
Oh my gosh.

2779
03:01:58,870 --> 03:01:59,390
I'm...

2780
03:02:00,230 --> 03:02:01,270
I'm ready.

2781
03:02:02,090 --> 03:02:02,570
Children!

2782
03:02:03,930 --> 03:02:06,730
She also has a much younger sister, but they live together.

2783
03:02:07,130 --> 03:02:08,190
She looks after her too.

2784
03:02:08,470 --> 03:02:09,350
She's amazing!

2785
03:02:14,270 --> 03:02:20,930
I mean, don't I don't mean to compare us, but there's a lot
of things I'm not so reliable at, you know?

2786
03:02:28,110 --> 03:02:33,650
Like I spoil my younger siblings way too much for them all
the time.

2787
03:02:39,230 --> 03:02:40,630
We have a wife.

2788
03:02:43,130 --> 03:02:44,750
I'm so proud of us, you guys.

2789
03:02:44,930 --> 03:02:45,870
I'm so proud of us.

2790
03:02:46,530 --> 03:02:48,390
We're going to grow old with Nin-Chain.

2791
03:02:49,650 --> 03:02:52,310
I'm going to be like that guy that married Hatsune Miku.

2792
03:02:52,930 --> 03:02:54,550
Just going to put Nin-Chain on an iPad.

2793
03:02:56,450 --> 03:02:58,330
Ah, talking about them is making me miss them.

2794
03:02:58,670 --> 03:02:59,690
I'll call when I go home.

2795
03:03:00,250 --> 03:03:02,310
Oh, they'll be asleep in the morning then.

2796
03:03:02,470 --> 03:03:10,140
Oh, that's extend.

2797
03:03:15,920 --> 03:03:18,580
I guess it doesn't really matter what I buy.

2798
03:03:18,740 --> 03:03:19,860
Let's get some fine wine.

2799
03:03:21,720 --> 03:03:22,600
What do you like?

2800
03:03:23,160 --> 03:03:24,380
What do you like?

2801
03:03:26,100 --> 03:03:27,680
What's your favorite thing?

2802
03:03:28,240 --> 03:03:29,540
Is it this yomand?

2803
03:03:30,300 --> 03:03:31,240
I don't know.

2804
03:03:32,060 --> 03:03:32,880
Don't forget the present.

2805
03:03:33,760 --> 03:03:34,640
I already gave it to her.

2806
03:03:35,540 --> 03:03:36,300
I already gave it to her.

2807
03:03:40,160 --> 03:03:43,020
I'm going to get the bunny punch since...

2808
03:03:46,300 --> 03:03:51,500
I mean, I could get the Lab Perry.

2809
03:03:54,800 --> 03:03:56,600
Everyone loves the yo-manned.

2810
03:03:57,360 --> 03:04:00,480
Oh my god, I almost accidentally pressed decision on this
one.

2811
03:04:09,910 --> 03:04:12,290
She liked the champagne a lot.

2812
03:04:13,330 --> 03:04:17,690
Yeah, look at her staring at me so patiently waiting for me
to make a decision.

2813
03:04:19,930 --> 03:04:21,170
See if it'll let you get...

2814
03:04:21,170 --> 03:04:22,150
No, I don't have enough money.

2815
03:04:22,290 --> 03:04:23,830
I don't have enough money for the Yomairon.

2816
03:04:25,290 --> 03:04:25,750
You know what?

2817
03:04:26,090 --> 03:04:27,670
Go big or go home.

2818
03:04:36,070 --> 03:04:38,390
We're getting paid soon anyway, so whatever.

2819
03:04:38,530 --> 03:04:39,310
It doesn't matter!

2820
03:04:40,950 --> 03:04:41,390
Itadakimasu!

2821
03:04:44,110 --> 03:04:44,550
Itadakimasu!

2822
03:04:46,850 --> 03:04:47,290
Okay.

2823
03:04:50,900 --> 03:04:51,600
Oh, yes.

2824
03:04:51,960 --> 03:04:52,740
I can't give her any...

2825
03:04:52,740 --> 03:04:53,140
Okay, yeah.

2826
03:04:53,980 --> 03:04:59,080
Oh, can you draw it all?

2827
03:04:59,240 --> 03:04:59,980
Like, illustrations?

2828
03:05:00,960 --> 03:05:01,620
Not very well.

2829
03:05:01,880 --> 03:05:02,380
Why do you ask?

2830
03:05:10,260 --> 03:05:12,540
I'll write the story and you can do the drawings.

2831
03:05:12,900 --> 03:05:15,320
Let's become a manga author tag team.

2832
03:05:15,640 --> 03:05:16,300
What do you say?

2833
03:05:17,200 --> 03:05:18,140
Can you write, Bin-chan?

2834
03:05:25,620 --> 03:05:31,620
Once upon a time, in a certain land, there was a father, I
mean, a mother and a father.

2835
03:05:33,300 --> 03:05:34,840
That sounds like the opening to a folktale.

2836
03:05:35,500 --> 03:05:37,400
Doesn't that sound more like a picture book than a manga?

2837
03:05:40,360 --> 03:05:47,700
A picture book author home, that's good work too.

2838
03:05:48,140 --> 03:05:53,340
make my little brother and sister really yummy every time
she sticks her finger up like that it makes me just want to

2839
03:05:53,340 --> 03:06:12,080
talk like a nerd that's like the very beginning of the story
but i can't but i can't come up with anything past that i

2840
03:06:12,080 --> 03:06:15,460
guess i'm just not cut out for it i wish i was more
creative.

2841
03:06:22,760 --> 03:06:27,320
When you read manga and stuff, do you ever think, man, I
wish I could write something this good.

2842
03:06:30,620 --> 03:06:32,140
I did when I was a kid.

2843
03:06:32,400 --> 03:06:34,640
I wanted to be a manga author or a film director.

2844
03:06:37,500 --> 03:06:37,940
Same.

2845
03:06:38,680 --> 03:06:40,540
I can't help envy people like that.

2846
03:06:44,700 --> 03:06:49,060
I wonder if I can write something too.

2847
03:06:49,540 --> 03:06:50,960
Maybe if it's a game genre I'm good at.

2848
03:06:51,020 --> 03:06:58,460
Haichan, can you draw sexy girls?

2849
03:06:59,680 --> 03:07:02,480
Sorry, but I don't think I can draw much of anything at all.

2850
03:07:03,220 --> 03:07:09,640
Maybe I should use you as a reference then I could get
better at...

2851
03:07:10,540 --> 03:07:11,480
Come on, Haito, say it.

2852
03:07:11,500 --> 03:07:13,300
Haito, say it.

2853
03:07:18,220 --> 03:07:19,880
Let's get something else to drink.

2854
03:07:26,600 --> 03:07:29,820
I'm starting to actually get a bit of a headache.

2855
03:07:30,520 --> 03:07:33,040
So this might be my last day, but I'm so sad.

2856
03:07:33,200 --> 03:07:34,300
I wanted to get more stuff.

2857
03:07:34,460 --> 03:07:38,540
I wanted to unlock the vacations.

2858
03:07:42,640 --> 03:07:52,200
but next time maybe so let's get to the end of this night
let's drink um i'm gonna have a simple beer i'm a simple man

2859
03:07:52,200 --> 03:07:53,500
and i'll get you

2860
03:07:56,640 --> 03:07:59,420
what did she like uh the high ball the umeshu

2861
03:08:09,870 --> 03:08:27,090
i like seeing just a tiny bit of cheeks right it's kind of
cute hi John are you hiding something from me no I don't

2862
03:08:27,090 --> 03:08:42,170
think so why do you ask draw me like your French girls mint
don't you find it hard to keep secrets like that I'm no good

2863
03:08:42,170 --> 03:08:45,430
at it people tell me that my face makes it super obvious.

2864
03:08:53,530 --> 03:08:58,170
I've tried planning surprise parties for friends and family
members, but it's never worked.

2865
03:08:58,550 --> 03:08:59,830
They always figure it out.

2866
03:09:00,570 --> 03:09:02,930
She knows I'm a VTuber.

2867
03:09:03,870 --> 03:09:05,450
She knows that I'm streaming this.

2868
03:09:07,310 --> 03:09:08,770
Are you good at keeping secrets, Hai Chang?

2869
03:09:10,430 --> 03:09:12,490
I have nothing to hide.

2870
03:09:12,870 --> 03:09:16,050
I have nothing to hide.

2871
03:09:23,450 --> 03:09:26,630
Oh my god, we got a good reaction out of her.

2872
03:09:28,710 --> 03:09:29,530
You can't be serious.

2873
03:09:29,870 --> 03:09:30,570
Nothing at all?

2874
03:09:30,990 --> 03:09:32,810
You just lay everything out bare, huh?

2875
03:09:33,130 --> 03:09:33,890
That's amazing.

2876
03:09:34,590 --> 03:09:42,850
I lay it all out, everybody.

2877
03:09:43,650 --> 03:09:50,510
I'm not good at keeping secrets, but I usually can't tell if
someone's hiding something from me You mean you don't notice

2878
03:09:50,510 --> 03:09:52,830
when someone lies to you?

2879
03:09:57,570 --> 03:10:01,030
The wall's been pulled over my eyes more than a few times.

2880
03:10:01,750 --> 03:10:05,070
It sucks Like what the heck?

2881
03:10:12,890 --> 03:10:15,710
When I try to lie, they figure it out right away.

2882
03:10:15,910 --> 03:10:16,730
It's not fair.

2883
03:10:17,290 --> 03:10:18,890
This whole world is so unfair.

2884
03:10:20,410 --> 03:10:21,450
She has toggles.

2885
03:10:22,230 --> 03:10:23,090
Oh, so-de-shoe.

2886
03:10:23,730 --> 03:10:26,150
Well, I don't really like people who lie a lot anyway.

2887
03:10:26,530 --> 03:10:28,410
I much prefer honest people like you, Rin-chan.

2888
03:10:36,150 --> 03:10:38,930
If you say so, then I guess it's fine.

2889
03:10:40,090 --> 03:10:40,810
Oh, it's getting late.

2890
03:10:40,970 --> 03:10:42,630
I'm sorry, I'm going to go home.

2891
03:10:43,430 --> 03:10:44,090
Holy moly.

2892
03:10:44,830 --> 03:10:45,610
I am broke.

2893
03:10:46,170 --> 03:10:47,210
This checks out.

2894
03:10:47,330 --> 03:10:49,750
You started the game telling everyone you just got fired.

2895
03:10:50,230 --> 03:10:51,470
That's so true.

2896
03:10:59,350 --> 03:11:01,090
Thank you for today.

2897
03:11:06,640 --> 03:11:07,160
Energy.

2898
03:11:07,160 --> 03:11:07,680
Motivation.

2899
03:11:09,200 --> 03:11:09,720
Money.

2900
03:11:10,140 --> 03:11:10,660

Nice.

2903
03:11:21,920 --> 03:11:23,320

2907

What's the most you've seen that someone has won?

2908
03:12:06,980 --> 03:12:08,020
That was awesome.

2909
03:12:10,520 --> 03:12:11,000
Yippee!

2910
03:12:13,440 --> 03:12:15,760

the archive.

03:12:16,040 --> 03:12:16,340
Yeah!

2912
03:12:18,220 --> 03:12:19,940

Oyasumi minto.

2918
03:12:32,280 --> 03:12:32,880
No way.

125k?

2920
03:12:34,640 --> 03:12:35,360
Are you lying?

2921
03:12:41,670 --> 03:12:43,050
What happens if you...

2922
03:12:43,050 --> 03:12:45,870
Well, I guess if you go broke, you have to work...

2923
03:12:45,870 --> 03:12:48,650
You have to do the dispatch and sleep, right?

2924
03:12:48,790 --> 03:12:50,310
Your overworked body.

2925
03:12:55,320 --> 03:12:56,980
No, we've been playing it safe, though.

2926
03:12:58,140 --> 03:12:58,620
So...

2927
03:12:59,240 --> 03:13:01,600
Maybe we gotta go bigger on the gifts, right?

2928
03:13:02,100 --> 03:13:06,600
Maybe I gotta get the luxury bag so that she'll love me and
let me take pictures of her.

2929
03:13:07,020 --> 03:13:11,320
I don't know, but we'll figure it out next time.

2930
03:13:11,520 --> 03:13:12,920
How long is this game, I wonder?

2931
03:13:13,280 --> 03:13:13,480
I'm so...

2932
03:13:15,080 --> 03:13:17,640
I feel like there's so much that I haven't seen yet.

2933
03:13:19,320 --> 03:13:20,840
But we'll play it next time.

2934
03:13:21,720 --> 03:13:22,360
Yes, yes, yes.

2935
03:13:22,760 --> 03:13:23,840
Go big or go home.

2936
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:25,060
Go big or go home.

2937
03:13:26,020 --> 03:13:29,380

Mint cancelled.

2946
03:14:33,100 --> 03:14:34,180
Mint cancelled.

2947
03:14:35,760 --> 03:14:37,080
And maybe it's bot.

2948
03:14:37,700 --> 03:14:38,240
I don't know.

2949
03:14:38,800 --> 03:14:40,300
But I noticed this morning I was like, whoa!

2950
03:14:40,800 --> 03:14:43,720
Because I saw that I was at, like, 144.

2951
03:14:44,980 --> 03:14:46,980
And then now I'm at, like, 135.

2952
03:14:50,400 --> 03:14:51,680
So I was, like, crazy.

2953
03:14:55,480 --> 03:14:57,260
They discovered you smell...

2954
03:14:57,880 --> 03:14:58,280
No!

2955
03:14:59,520 --> 03:14:59,920
No!

2956
03:15:00,220 --> 03:15:02,940
I have to think of something to do for 200k though.

2957
03:15:04,480 --> 03:15:06,500
I didn't think of anything for 100k.

2958
03:15:06,980 --> 03:15:09,400
So I have to think of something really good for 200k.

2959
03:15:10,600 --> 03:15:14,460
But I think I still have a little bit of time to think of
something.

2960
03:15:15,220 --> 03:15:16,920
So, I'll try.

2961
03:15:18,380 --> 03:15:19,220
Think of something.

2962
03:15:23,980 --> 03:15:25,780
Anyway, I'm gonna go to bed now.

2963
03:15:26,860 --> 03:15:27,260
Oh yeah, so I'm gonna go to bed now.

2964
03:15:32,270 --> 03:15:33,870
You ego-searching, huh?

2965
03:15:34,110 --> 03:15:37,270
Oh yeah, going to my own profile is totally ego-searching.

2966
03:15:37,610 --> 03:15:38,410
Yes, thank you.

2967
03:15:40,530 --> 03:15:41,010
Gosh.

2968
03:15:42,430 --> 03:15:44,990
Actually, you can't even ego-search my name.

2969
03:15:45,170 --> 03:15:45,690
Because you know what?

2970
03:15:45,730 --> 03:15:48,190
If you search Mint, all you get is a bunch of
cryptocurrency.

2971
03:15:48,770 --> 03:15:50,530
So I can't even ego-search me.

2972
03:15:55,470 --> 03:15:57,110
All you get is crypto.

2973
03:16:00,910 --> 03:16:01,530
It's impossible.

2974
03:16:01,550 --> 03:16:16,010
possible okay bye bye bye see you later see you tomorrow bye
bye bye bye bye bye
