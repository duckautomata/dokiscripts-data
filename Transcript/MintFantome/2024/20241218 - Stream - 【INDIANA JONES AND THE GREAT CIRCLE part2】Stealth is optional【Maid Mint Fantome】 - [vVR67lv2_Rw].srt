1
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,760
Okarinasamase, partner.

2
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,920
And he's not.

3
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,200
A cowboy.

4
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,360
Howdy.

5
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,100
Howdy.

6
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,440
Howdy, fellas.

7
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,860
Oh yeah, I have a whip!

8
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,420
Oh yeah, baby.

9
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
Oh yeah.

10
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,440
This is Red Dead Redemption.

11
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,400
Welcome!

12
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,720
Welcome everybody, welcome, welcome, welcome back to Indiana Jones.

13
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,190
Last time...

14
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:14,350
Last time we were working and then a bald guy beat us up at the school and he stole some stuff.

15
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,430
He stole the cat mummy.

16
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:26,030
And now we're in Italy and we're dressed up as a priest and we're sneaking around.

17
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:27,610
Yeah!

18
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,910
Freak phantom with the whip.

19
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,210
Like snake?

20
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:39,690
No.

21
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,890
I say we're sneaking but we're not being super sneaky.

22
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,070
Probably.

23
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,870
Anyways, it's been a minute.

24
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,770
Quite a bit has happened since I last streamed.

25
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:56,650
And also, I want to address, last time I streamed this game, the game was like...

26
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,310
I can't, I can't play.

27
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,770
It was like, when I, so it's hard to, sometimes it's hard to tell.

28
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:16,410
When you set up, like when you set up and you're testing the game and it works and then you start the VTuber magic and you're just like, oh no.

29
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:21,790
Game plus VTuber magic, it's just not like that.

30
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:35,290
So I was testing some settings earlier and no matter what I turned on, what I turned off, what I did separately, like there were people in pre-chat being like, you should change this setting.

31
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,770
I had already tried it and it didn't change anything.

32
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,790
I was going through everything and so I was like...

33
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:51,190
And so I was, I was, I was venting to some friends.

34
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:56,070
I was like, man, this sucks, this game, what the hell?

35
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:03,550
And actually one of my friends was just like, oh, well, you know, you can, you got it on Game Pass.

36
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:18,110
I have a Xbox I don't really use if you want to borrow or if you want to keep it, like if I pay for it later, I don't know how much I'll use it.

37
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:29,410
But yeah, so that's, now I switched to Xbox so that we don't have to even consider my computer.

38
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,770
Yippee!

39
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,110
Get the Xbox mic too.

40
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,490
Oh gosh.

41
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:55,700
Mom said I can play for like five minutes before dinner.

42
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,080
It's cutting?

43
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:16,050
I'm going to play some Fortnite after this.

44
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,390
And then I got to do some homework.

45
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,430
I got to do some homework after this.

46
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,910
So after that I can only play for a little while.

47
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,990
I don't think so.

48
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,210
I don't think so.

49
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,470
Where was my Waffle House fight?

50
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,010
We were right next to one and you ditched me.

51
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,550
I...

52
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,550
I was there.

53
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,190
I think you need to open your third eye.

54
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,910
I think you need to open your third eye.

55
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,110
If you can't see spirits.

56
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,150
Everybody shame Ashes.

57
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,710
Ashes can't see ghosts.

58
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,380
Wow, that's so sad for you.

59
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,680
Shame.

60
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,040
Oh my goodness.

61
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,000
What's up Phantom Thief Revenge?

62
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,740
Shoutout to Krisu over the VOD.

63
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,440
I played but I turned 29 yesterday.

64
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,360
One more year before I join House Gryffindor as a level 30 wizard.

65
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,240
May I humbly request a Metal Gear birthday song.

66
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,000
I think... I don't know if you'd be Gryffindor.

67
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,200
Happy birthday, congratulations.

68
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,320
Happy birthday with salutations.

69
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,000
Happy birthday, may your sky stay blue.

70
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,660
Happy birthday to you.

71
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,860
Ghost of Mint.

72
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,780
Oh my gosh.

73
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,400
Wait, another birthday.

74
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,000
It's my birthday today.

75
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,980
I don't need a song.

76
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,660
Can I ask you to say...

77
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,860
Mint is one of the most awesome people I know that can achieve so many things.

78
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,190
Mint is one of the most awesome people I know that can achieve so many things.

79
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,030
Happy birthday.

80
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,710
I did say it.

81
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:17,230
Yeah, the concert was a lot of fun.

82
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,290
I talked with... well, Doki and I talked about it after the concert.

83
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:28,770
If you want to see more stuff that we said about it in the post-concert stream on her channel.

84
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:36,570
I watched back the VOD that Krisu uploaded.

85
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,930
I was so happy to actually have that kind of as a memory, you know.

86
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,670
Some little backstage magic, right?

87
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,270
Thank you for the two weeks notice.

88
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,410
What was that two weeks notice tweet?

89
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,470
No, it was about...

90
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,430
It was about Madara, my two weeks notice to her.

91
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:14,670
But I was watching back and I was like, okay, so here's some little...

92
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,850
So, you know, obviously for most of the songs we had the...

93
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,770
We had the...

94
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,130
We had like a mic set up on our ears, right?

95
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,130
Thank you for the 50!

96
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,790
Thank you so much!

97
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,870
And thank you for live streaming it too.

98
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,670
Oh my gosh, it was so crazy.

99
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,790
But...

100
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:50,590
I was like, oh, well, I want to have a mic for break stuff.

101
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,890
So I can like, you know, sing into it and like...

102
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,970
Into it and everything.

103
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,670
And I was like, oh...

104
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,350
So I had it for...

105
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,690
I had it for Triangle Dreamer and then also break stuff.

106
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:11,650
And...

107
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,130
But...

108
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:18,790
But it's very obvious I'm not used to...

109
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,850
Singing and dancing with a prop mic.

110
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,910
Because I had the headset on, right?

111
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,280
I was watching back and I was like...

112
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,160
Oh...

113
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,480
Oh...

114
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,580
Oh...

115
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:44,100
I needed to commit to the mic and I didn't.

116
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,830
Oopsie.

117
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,010
Double the mic, double the volume.

118
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,810
We would have never known...

119
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,850
No, I think if you watch back you can 100% see.

120
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,810
That the...

121
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,190
That it was a...

122
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,050
Barely take it further.

123
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,270
So happy I got to see everyone in 3D for the very first time.

124
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,650
Thank you!

125
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,870
Did you hear our special mix for Triangle Dreamer?

126
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,390
I didn't.

127
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:29,870
What was it?

128
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,190
It was...

129
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,850
You know, I had...

130
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,290
I could hear people, I could hear you guys.

131
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:36,950
But...

132
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,130
When there's also the music and the monitor and everything in my ears...

133
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,090
It's not...

134
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,290
It wasn't super easy.

135
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,250
Like, I could hear you guys...

136
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,250
When, you know...

137
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,350
When Doki was performing, but with...

138
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,610
When I'm performing...

139
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,590
It was...

140
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,330
Not super...

141
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,030
Like sometimes, if you guys were loud enough, I'd be like...

142
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:05,530
I didn't notice and I was there in person.

143
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,370
Ok, then don't rewatch it.

144
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,890
Because you'll really notice now that you know.

145
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,430
Because I would just kind of lose myself.

146
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,710
I'd be like...

147
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,510
And then I'd be like...

148
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,750
How did I just...

149
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,630
I'm not even doing anything.

150
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,370
Game?

151
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,250
I'm going to look back at it.

152
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:33,610
No!

153
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,190
Paying extra attention.

154
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,630
No!

155
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,170
I'm glad you guys liked the concert.

156
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,950
I was so happy.

157
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,250
I think overall, even though I messed up a bunch...

158
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,650
I think it all turned out really well.

159
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,130
I was really happy with it.

160
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,050
Thank you guys.

161
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,770
Thank you everybody who was able to go.

162
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,530
I got so hyped when I heard last cup of coffee.

163
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,810
I actually wasn't going to bring it up that I was the one who suggested it.

164
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,050
I went to Doki and I was like...

165
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,010
Ok, crazy idea.

166
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,190
Feel free to...

167
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,930
Feel free to veto this.

168
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:25,970
But...

169
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,050
You know, I just thought that...

170
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,190
Like, I really liked the song.

171
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,890
And I was like, this could be a good chance to like, you know...

172
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:47,230
If anybody had any negative feelings about it, this would be maybe a good chance to have it become like a better type of a memory.

173
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,570
So, you know...

174
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,570
I was like, you know, maybe...

175
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:01,640
It could be something like that instead of, you know, if someone hears it somewhere for some reason and be like...

176
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:11,530
They could instead be like, yeah, I saw Doki and Mint perform that song in 3D.

177
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,950
And it was really such a fun and good event.

178
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,130
Yeah.

179
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:19,800
So...

180
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,920
Hopefully that's the way it...

181
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,160
Turned out for some people.

182
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,360
Turned out for you guys.

183
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,200
Mintboy!

184
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,600
Watched Chris's video, you were so cute.

185
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,360
Thank you!

186
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,680
Thank you!

187
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,290
I'm guessing you saw, heard Herb saying Snake Eater.

188
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,890
Thoughts?

189
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,910
I messaged her right afterwards.

190
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,930
I messaged her.

191
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,630
I was just like...

192
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,150
Herb!

193
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,690
I was like...

194
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,910
Snake Eater!

195
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:56,770
She...

196
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,550
She's so sweet, gosh.

197
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,870
I love her so much.

198
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:00,670
She was just like...

199
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,110
I almost said...

200
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,110
I hope...

201
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,350
Mint enjoyed that.

202
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,650
Thinking that I might be in the crowd.

203
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,890
And if you had a certain chill, maybe...

204
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,290
Maybe you also have a sixth sense.

205
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,270
Because I was haunting the concert.

206
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,670
So...

207
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,630
So proud of you, Minky.

208
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,530
Thank you!

209
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:22,770
Linkat!

210
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:28,210
Shoutout to Weben for lifting me during the Gachikoi Koujou at the end of Triangle Dreamer.

211
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,250
Let's go!

212
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,130
Yeah!

213
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,830
Yeah, it was a lot of fun, so...

214
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,670
Hopefully...

215
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,610
Hopefully...

216
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:44,390
Hopefully I can do more 3D concerts.

217
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,930
Can you elaborate on the Lonely Island?

218
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,130
What do you...

219
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:49,810
What's...

220
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,170
What do you...

221
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,010
Elaborate on what part?

222
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,130
See, it was for you.

223
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:57,890
No!

224
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,730
She said that she always wanted to sing that song.

225
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,810
That she knew I was a big fan of Metal Gear.

226
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,010
But I don't think she realizes.

227
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,280
Seems self-explanatory to me.

228
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,420
So, the...

229
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,400
Some, you know...

230
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,960
If you're confused about the ending lyric...

231
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,920
The ending lyric is...

232
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,100
If you had sex in the last 30 minutes...

233
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,900
You are qualified to sing with us.

234
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:25,620
Right?

235
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,180
And I just thought that the whole...

236
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,420
The whole concert...

237
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,060
Was...

238
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,400
Was the sex.

239
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,960
So everybody in the room...

240
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,940
Was able to sing it.

241
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,860
Why are you guys saying...

242
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,340
Why are you guys saying what?

243
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,440
What do you mean?

244
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,600
Hold on, my chat broke.

245
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,180
Hold on.

246
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,620
I have to refresh YouTube.

247
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,960
You don't think so?

248
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,520
Is it not like that?

249
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,360
Where it's just like...

250
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,860
Oh yeah, that concert was...

251
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,180
Was it.

252
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,800
That was like the sex.

253
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,860
And so, congrats...

254
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,460
Oh gosh.

255
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,080
Hold on.

256
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,760
It's the congratulations.

257
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,520
You know?

258
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,080
Does that mean there will be a bunch of wisp goons popping out...

259
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,960
In 9 months?

260
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,580
I...

261
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,940
I don't know.

262
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,580
I don't know.

263
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,440
I don't know.

264
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,490
The concert was so amazing getting to run in the Hamtaro circle.

265
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,170
I wouldn't say run.

266
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,690
It was like the Hamtaro trot.

267
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,370
The Hamtaro shuffle.

268
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,070
It was like if a retirement home had done the Hamtaro...

269
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,770
The Hamtaro circle.

270
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,870
That's okay though.

271
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,150
You guys...

272
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,830
You guys did the best with what you had, you know?

273
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,590
The concert was very sex, but also hung.

274
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,230
It's like you were meant to perform on stage in front of a crowd that's excited to see you.

275
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,150
Shut up!

276
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,770
Do the shuffle.

277
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,950
So rude.

278
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,190
So rude.

279
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,170
What else?

280
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:37,370
Yeah.

281
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,270
I don't know.

282
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,270
I just felt so...

283
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:42,710
I don't know.

284
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,030
I was reading everybody's letters.

285
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,270
I was reading them today and yesterday.

286
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,450
Realize you're 2k away from 300k.

287
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:49,830
Let's go.

288
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,530
Let's go!

289
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,650
I wasn't there, but...

290
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,070
Disappointment.

291
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,460
Yeah.

292
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,980
I was reading everybody's letters.

293
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,390
I was getting all emotional and I was just like...

294
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,920
Thank you guys.

295
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,000
Really appreciate it.

296
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,160
Wait, you can read?

297
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,340
Oh my gosh.

298
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,240
I got like some checkies from people.

299
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,450
Of like...

300
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,700
Some took checkies like during the show.

301
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,560
And like people walking before the show.

302
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,700
Oh my gosh.

303
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,630
Those are my like...

304
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,240
My treasures.

305
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,960
Oh, and...

306
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,410
I don't know if Seymour is here, but...

307
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,420
Seymour, he took some great photos too.

308
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,480
I got those.

309
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,540
Nah.

310
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,300
I want... If there's a... I don't know if they were...

311
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,340
The one with everybody.

312
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,340
Like there was a big group photo.

313
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,140
The group pic.

314
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:10,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

315
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,040
There was a really big group pic.

316
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,340
I don't know if because of the way that they...

317
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,000
Were shot.

318
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,340
If it was like, you know, digital or...

319
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,240
Or what.

320
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,660
But I want the group photo.

321
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,100
I was like...

322
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,280
I might try to scan it and then make it my Twitter.

323
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,340
My Twitter banner.

324
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,880
It's so cute.

325
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,220
It was Polaroid.

326
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,760
Because they're like really big.

327
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,380
They're really big.

328
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,940
And then people gave me some cute things.

329
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,040
I got a bunch of stickers.

330
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,160
And lots of cute letters.

331
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,700
And... Wait, where's the... Hold on.

332
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,040
Let me grab the checkie sheet.

333
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,800
Let me see.

334
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,360
The checkie sheet is so pretty.

335
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,220
It's so pretty.

336
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,640
Wait, how do I say this?

337
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,460
They wrote their name but they have fancy handwriting.

338
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,320
I can't read.

339
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,220
Grail...

340
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,500
Nates.

341
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,540
Grail Nates.

342
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,220
I don't know.

343
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,620
But it's the most beautiful checkie sheet ever.

344
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,980
It's so shiny and so beautiful.

345
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,760
I can't read.

346
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,500
I can't read!

347
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,080
I wanted to thank you and Doki for the show.

348
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,520
Not only because it was an amazing concert but because I got to meet so many Wisps for the first time.

349
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,880
Thanks for going Spice.

350
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,380
Bear hours.

351
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,160
Welcome to my worship.

352
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,820
Thank you.

353
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,200
I can't read.

354
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,380
But it's such a beautiful checkie sheet.

355
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,300
Oh my gosh.

356
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,660
I was staring at it like all...

357
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,840
All today.

358
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,780
I was like...

359
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,620
It's beautiful.

360
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,140
Heard you made Pia play MGS3.

361
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,400
And made Snake barf.

362
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:04,700
Yeah!

363
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,200
Pia and I, we went to...

364
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,180
We went to TGS together.

365
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:10,560
Wow!

366
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,140
Thank you!

367
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,020
Thank you for the Haka so far!

368
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,360
Great job with the concert.

369
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,640
Sorry I'm yapping so much you guys.

370
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,000
Don't worry.

371
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,760
We'll get into the game.

372
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,660
This always happens when I've been gone for a couple days.

373
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,820
I yap before I game.

374
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,190
But yeah, I love Pia.

375
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:34,650
She helped me at TGS with getting to...

376
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:40,850
She helped me at TGS with getting to the MGS booth.

377
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,530
And we walked around all together.

378
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,030
And it was just... She's just so sweet.

379
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,670
Mhm.

380
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,130
And...

381
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:53,950
Yeah.

382
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,490
Just got back from AW...

383
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,530
Are you... Oh, sorry.

384
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,030
Awa, according to Ina.

385
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,190
And had so much fun there at Phantom Thief.

386
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,030
I just got...

387
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,430
Oh, I got to make Wisp friends.

388
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,110
Learn about the gay and be in my first Samtaro circle.

389
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,530
Thanks for being around.

390
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,090
Binky, without you in this community, I would never have tried any of this.

391
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,330
Weeaboo!

392
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:20,410
Wait, that sounds funny if I just call you Weeaboo.

393
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,350
Because it seems like...

394
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,590
Weeaboo danger.

395
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,190
Thank you!

396
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,690
Thank you, thank you.

397
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,770
New Wisp job opening.

398
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:34,590
Reading Wisp.

399
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,030
The reading Wisp.

400
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,090
Weeaboo.

401
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,230
But, um...

402
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,390
Glad you got our group Shikishi.

403
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:47,890
Yes!

404
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,370
Thank you, Tony!

405
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,210
Yeah, I got the group one.

406
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,030
It's so cute.

407
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,350
Thank you, thank you.

408
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,510
Samtaro circle never even made it halfway around the room, sad.

409
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,610
It's okay.

410
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,450
It's okay, it's okay.

411
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,850
Should really change that username.

412
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:07,510
Why?

413
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,150
Don't!

414
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,270
Don't change it.

415
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:10,950
Be proud.

416
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,690
Be proud.

417
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,510
You guys, I just realized I forgot to get more tea.

418
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,530
I forgot to get more tea.

419
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,210
So I'm gonna go grab some real, real quick.

420
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:28,490
I was eating frozen mango and then I forgot to get tea.

421
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:35,090
During off-kind next round, we'll send you some gift as a way to not be able to go to the concert.

422
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,350
You don't have... What are you talking about?

423
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,390
No, you don't have to send anything.

424
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,810
I was like, oh, I couldn't make it to the concert.

425
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:41,230
No!

426
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,950
Watched the bot at the office yesterday.

427
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,690
My co-workers were wondering why I went full...

428
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,730
Not knowing I had your...

429
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,110
Just a sick song playing in my headphones.

430
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,580
Howdy-meeto, Eric!

431
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,220
Hope you're doing well today.

432
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:09,860
You too!

433
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,660
Okay, BRB, guys.

434
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,380
I'm just gonna go run and grab the hot water.

435
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,860
BRB, BRB, BRB.

436
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,540
Fast.

437
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,490
Okay.

438
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,250
I'm back.

439
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:16,850
I'm ready to play Indiana Jones.

440
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:19,790
Oh.

441
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:21,750
There's your...

442
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,650
Wait, what's the previous one?

443
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,370
Oh, Ducky.

444
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,730
Thanks for the amazing concert and giving me an excuse to go to...

445
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,610
Awa...

446
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,050
Meeto.

447
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,870
Got to try Otake and participate in the Hamtaro Circle for the first time.

448
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,070
You guys have like the same exact message.

449
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,610
Got to see some Wisp friends again.

450
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,070
Yippee!

451
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:42,830
Yippee!

452
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,910
Ducky, why do you have like a signature?

453
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,870
Why do you have...

454
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,970
Like a wildest duck signature?

455
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,090
It has like...

456
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,270
Why not?

457
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,130
Orka, help me with it.

458
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,610
Was not prepared for the whiplash from the setlist.

459
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,670
I warned you.

460
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:10,790
I warned you that you guys were not ready for the setlist.

461
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,450
I warned you.

462
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,430
I warned you!

463
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,250
I got paid?

464
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,270
No way!

465
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,110
Break stuff was so good.

466
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,070
I felt really confident in it.

467
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:27,470
I was like, oh my gosh, this might have been the best job of me singing break stuff ever.

468
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,170
So I can't wait to upload it.

469
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,530
But I messed up, you guys!

470
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,130
You guys!

471
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,150
I messed up, I messed up.

472
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,630
I got nervous in saying the I feel like shit part too early.

473
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,690
And I corrected it later on.

474
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,350
I was so mad at myself afterwards.

475
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,830
I was like, no, I can't.

476
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:48,830
But I had to commit.

477
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,530
But they asked if I wanted to like...

478
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,190
Because they have the audio, right?

479
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:59,130
They asked if I wanted to have someone like edit it to fix it.

480
00:29:59,170 --> 00:29:59,750
But I was like...

481
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,700
I don't know.

482
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,500
I think I should just leave it the way that it is.

483
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,940
But it just sounds off the whole time.

484
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,860
It worked in the end.

485
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
They were like, do you want to fix it?

486
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:18,460
I was like, no, I guess I'll just keep it as it was.

487
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,700
The finale song gets a lot of attention, but I feel like Junna's golden shower was way more unhinged.

488
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,000
You are 100% correct.

489
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,800
You are 100% correct in that.

490
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,880
We found out everybody else's setlist the day of.

491
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,220
I was like, what is this?

492
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,180
I saw it on the setlist written there.

493
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,880
I was like, huh?

494
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,080
Surely it's like...

495
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,360
Surely it's like...

496
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,080
Not what it says.

497
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,760
Who made the setlist, by the way?

498
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,900
I chose my songs.

499
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,180
And Doki chose her songs, obviously.

500
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,420
Pia was so talented too.

501
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,920
Yeah, Pia was so talented.

502
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,080
Phoebe was so talented.

503
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,900
Junna, despite the sussiness, was also so talented.

504
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,480
And then for some of the group songs, or for the duet songs...

505
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:50,600
The first song, actually, that we sang, Ii ne te iya, which we did an English custom version.

506
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,680
We do plan on wanting to release a music video.

507
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:04,560
Not from the concert, but we'll record and have it as a proper cover that we want to do.

508
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:11,120
And Doki got someone to do the lyrics for us and have it customized to us.

509
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,340
So it was really, really cute.

510
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:22,800
I saw some people translating it as, like, good is... good is yeah, or something.

511
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:31,480
But the ii ne kind of translates to, like, you know when you like something on Twitter?

512
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,260
It's like, that's what ii ne is, you know?

513
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,660
Like, ii ne is what you call, like, liking.

514
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,860
In Japanese.

515
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,780
So it's more like, that's why we say in the song, hit, like, hit, like.

516
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,980
So, it's more like, it's hard to describe, how would you describe it?

517
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,600
It's like, like it, yeah!

518
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:04,840
Kind of more of a title in that kind of regard.

519
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,560
But ii ne, of course, means, like, it's good, ii ne.

520
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,580
But, like, in this context, it's like, hit like.

521
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,480
Yeah, subscribe, subscribe, subscribe.

522
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,600
Exactly, exactly.

523
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,540
Press the ii ne button.

524
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,540
It's good, isn't it?

525
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,600
No!

526
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,400
Too sad!

527
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,300
Hi Minto.

528
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,060
Hi Daniel!

529
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,900
I thought it meant, in a...

530
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:36,580
What?

531
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,620
Please give a like and leave a comment.

532
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,960
No, please subscribe.

533
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,940
Subscribe, like, comment, please subscribe.

534
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,300
Yes!

535
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,940
Didn't have time to write a letter besides sending one from the community.

536
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,620
But it makes me happy to know you asked for it and were able to get my stickers.

537
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,360
Yeah!

538
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,840
Yeah, thank you.

539
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,360
Oh my gosh.

540
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,000
One thing that I got that was so, so cool was Imu.

541
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,540
Imu, if you're listening.

542
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,100
Thank you so much.

543
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,620
I was so happy.

544
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,140
So, Imu sent a letter, but also Imu is a fan of Ayami Mama.

545
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:32,160
And sent the tiniest tapestry I've ever received, ever.

546
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,540
It's like the teeniest, tiniest little wall scroll.

547
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,940
But it's of Ayami Mama's art, and I've never even seen it before.

548
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,240
I was like, when I saw it, when I got it, I was like, what?

549
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,780
And it's of Rem and Rem and Rem.

550
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,340
So I was like, Ayami Rem.

551
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,620
How I became a fan of Ayami to begin with.

552
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,920
So, thank you so much.

553
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,780
I have it hanging off.

554
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,740
It's so, so cute.

555
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:56,780
Thank you.

556
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,280
Was it lewd?

557
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,080
No.

558
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,260
But yeah, thank you.

559
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,320
So everybody gave.

560
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,120
Everybody's letters were so sweet.

561
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,100
Everybody's little presents were so sweet.

562
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,900
I really, really appreciate it.

563
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,020
Thank you guys.

564
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,980
Back for more indie goodness.

565
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,780
Oh my gosh, it's already been 35 minutes.

566
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,060
I...

567
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,320
Oh, I don't remember how to play this game.

568
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,840
So I'm gonna have to remember how to play this game.

569
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,240
So...

570
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:37,000
I'm gonna do something real quick, because I think I turned up the brightness when I played before.

571
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,400
So let me do that.

572
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,780
I was like, oh, it's like kind of...

573
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,020
Hello?

574
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,960
Oh, that's filter brightness.

575
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:45,820
I'm stupid.

576
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,920
Where's the brightness, brightness?

577
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:48,980
Hello?

578
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,900
It's a tiny bit dark.

579
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:00,400
Yeah.

580
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,220
High contrast mode.

581
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,520
Can't tell.

582
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:06,940
Gamma?

583
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,040
Where do you see the...

584
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,040
Oh, edit brightness.

585
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,560
Ah, here we go, here we go.

586
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,140
I turned it like way up before.

587
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,080
I was like, yo, I can't see anything.

588
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,300
Okay.

589
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,900
UI brightness, this should be fine.

590
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,940
Yeah, that's good.

591
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,660
Okay, that's so much better.

592
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,660
That's so much better.

593
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,780
I was able to get one of my Ace Combat figures.

594
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
I sent you.

595
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,920
Oh, hello.

596
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:43,980
Hello.

597
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,340
Shout out to the GigaChad that recorded with 3DS.

598
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,260
You guys, I have to remember what the controls are for this game.

599
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,860
There's so many controls.

600
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,060
There's so many controls.

601
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,100
Opens from the other side.

602
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,660
Okay, hold on.

603
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:00,900
Let's see.

604
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,780
This is...

605
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,920
Hold on, I'm just gonna...

606
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,750
Okay.

607
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,310
Okay, that's punch.

608
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,330
This is whip.

609
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,610
Whip it good.

610
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,410
This is also punch.

611
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:22,710
Okay.

612
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,670
Good thing we have our little hidey hole.

613
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,870
And this is also punch, so...

614
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,570
Left trigger, left button are both punch.

615
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,050
And then...

616
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,690
Right trigger is also punch.

617
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,470
Okay.

618
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,990
LB might be the block.

619
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,990
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

620
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,510
LB is block parry.

621
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,110
Okay, okay.

622
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,010
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

623
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,970
And then...

624
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:52,670
This is jump.

625
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,830
This is crouch.

626
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,650
X and Y, I'm not quite sure.

627
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,690
Wasn't there a way to see what our mission was?

628
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,170
Hello.

629
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,630
Oh no, I just realized.

630
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,330
Okay, I'm gonna go down a little bit.

631
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:18,590
Perfect.

632
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,390
What did the youngster say?

633
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,910
You ate and left no crumbs?

634
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:24,290
Thanks.

635
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:26,830
Can I climb this?

636
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,530
Oh, here we go.

637
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,330
I don't know if I should be up here.

638
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,830
Oh, I can take a picture.

639
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:39,330
Wait.

640
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,250
What am I taking a picture of?

641
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,310
Oh, RB.

642
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,130
No, no, no.

643
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,790
Equip, equip, equip, equip.

644
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:03,450
Nobody saw.

645
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:06,570
Oh, here we go.

646
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,370
Maybe they want to take a picture of this.

647
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,400
No?

648
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,220
What am I taking a picture of?

649
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:19,800
What am I taking a picture of?

650
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,200
This?

651
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,560
Pizza.

652
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,300
Chandelier.

653
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,220
No, the chandelier is...

654
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,700
Maybe this.

655
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,540
Oh, window cleaning!

656
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:39,820
Cleaning!

657
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,100
Okay.

658
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,460
Indy is an artist and I just don't understand his craft.

659
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,400
Indy is an art...

660
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,680
Look at this orange.

661
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,580
What can I...

662
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,340
When can I expect my cheque from Indy-tan?

663
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,360
Flash...

664
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,980
Flash mesh.

665
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,680
Thanks for the big concert.

666
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,740
I got to show what I learned from the otage and mix panels at AWA.

667
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,260
By the way, how do you turn off yakai?

668
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,420
I'm doing waza spontaneously.

669
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,620
That's the great part.

670
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,300
You know!

671
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,160
Oh, can I put this orange away?

672
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:33,720
Okay.

673
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:34,920
Alright.

674
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,260
Put it away.

675
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,200
Put it away.

676
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:41,920
Alright.

677
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,400
No, no, no!

678
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,300
How do I put it away?

679
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:46,840
You know what?

680
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,660
I'll just eat it.

681
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:50,960
Gosh.

682
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:54,880
Why?

683
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:57,940
Thank you!

684
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,640
Okay, you guys.

685
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,540
It's going to take me a minute to get back into the groove of it.

686
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,900
How do I get up there?

687
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,380
Okay, so we're trying to find another way...

688
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,240
around those guards.

689
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,420
Why aren't they saying anything anymore?

690
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,560
That priest is just always monkeying around.

691
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,340
Okay, and that's how you sprint.

692
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:40,740
Alright.

693
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,400
Very good.

694
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,460
We're all good.

695
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,440
I love seeing you in Phantom Thief.

696
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,460
Thank you!

697
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:56,180
The concert was so much fun, especially being in the crowd screaming and cheering my heart out.

698
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,000
Can't wait for Indie-tan to get started.

699
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,920
Why Indie-tan?

700
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,800
Am I...is this an area that I'm not allowed to be in?

701
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,460
I can't remember.

702
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,080
Can I...am I allowed here?

703
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,760
I guess so.

704
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:26,540
Okay, usually it'll turn red in the...

705
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,600
in the bottom left.

706
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:30,860
Bless you!

707
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,220
Hello!

708
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,460
What's that?

709
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,660
Do you think he'll turn around?

710
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,060
I wasn't grabbing for anything.

711
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:54,630
Thank you!

712
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:55,410
Thank you!

713
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:55,590
Kiss!

714
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:56,690
Kiss!

715
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:57,710
Thank you!

716
00:42:58,930 --> 00:42:59,750
Oh, what did you hear?

717
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,350
He was coming at me!

718
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:04,910
I didn't do anything!

719
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:06,890
I don't know what you're talking about!

720
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,330
I can't go in here.

721
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,670
Okay, I'm trapped now.

722
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,010
I think.

723
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:16,250
I guess I go this way because I'm trapped.

724
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,150
Maybe over here?

725
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:23,270
Oh gosh.

726
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:29,510
Oh, we're fine.

727
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,170
Everything's good.

728
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:33,010
Oh, I can RB here.

729
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:36,690
Bless you!

730
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:39,210
Everybody's always sneezing around here.

731
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,570
Can I give to you as a video game case cover?

732
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:45,050
I heard you didn't have one of them, so I was thinking about...

733
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,190
You didn't have to!

734
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:47,890
You don't have to.

735
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:48,850
You really don't have to.

736
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:51,390
I think I'm good.

737
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:52,810
Maybe I can like...

738
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:54,950
And then I...

739
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:06,210
Oh gosh, everybody saw me fall.

740
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:06,990
It's so embarrassing.

741
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:09,670
My knees!

742
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,890
Limping Indy.

743
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:18,990
These priests, man, they just...

744
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:20,570
They're crazy now.

745
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,870
I think I'm back where I started.

746
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:26,450
Bless you!

747
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:28,750
I think we gotta go up through there.

748
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:29,910
Dang it.

749
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:32,110
Wait, how do I... How do I get around?

750
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,020
Oh gosh.

751
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,240
Yeah, I'm just a priest.

752
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:44,500
How?

753
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:45,300
What?

754
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,360
Okay, hold on.

755
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,940
Excuse me.

756
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,280
I have... I have godly things to do.

757
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:03,840
Okay, it saved for some reason.

758
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:04,660
Don't save!

759
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,660
I lost health!

760
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,210
We have to be careful here.

761
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:16,510
Not to get caught.

762
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,750
We're fine.

763
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:23,150
We're okay.

764
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:25,050
Alright, let's go around.

765
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:27,490
I think we went through that upstairs.

766
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:34,650
So I think if we go back through there, we can get through.

767
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,330
I'm getting noticed.

768
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,270
I'm getting noticed.

769
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:42,030
Don't perceive me.

770
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,010
No, please.

771
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:48,570
Jesus, take the whip.

772
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,200
We'll wait for when nobody is looking.

773
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,600
There we go.

774
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:00,540
Nice.

775
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,740
I'm crawling.

776
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,840
How do I stand up?

777
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,460
Get up, Indy!

778
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,380
No, no, no.

779
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:12,840
I don't know what I'm doing.

780
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,000
Up here?

781
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,220
Up here.

782
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,200
Nice.

783
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,280
Your streams are a great source of comfort and laughs whenever I'm having a tough time.

784
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,400
Chovek, you're being nice to me.

785
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:28,880
What happened?

786
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,520
You must be really having a tough time.

787
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:32,780
Are you okay?

788
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,200
Don't be angry.

789
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,140
Oh, man.

790
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,580
What are you staring at?

791
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:55,580
Just a... just a... you know, parkouring priest.

792
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,440
No big deal here.

793
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,600
Nothing to be concerned about.

794
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,360
This is how all priests get up.

795
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,280
Picture?

796
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,440
Wait, what's this?

797
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,800
There is some bread here.

798
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,240
Oh, my item limit has reached.

799
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:13,800
Where is the picture at?

800
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:17,810
Oh, wait.

801
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:19,450
The courtyard.

802
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,730
Oh, okay.

803
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:26,630
Everybody is a critic.

804
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:27,790
What?

805
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:30,650
What?

806
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,390
It literally shows right here.

807
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,430
Oh, there we go.

808
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,510
They are tiny.

809
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,270
Little babies.

810
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:46,450
Do you think he's gone?

811
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:48,210
This guy is so lazy.

812
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:49,690
What is this?

813
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:54,530
I won't grab it.

814
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:55,910
He might get angry at me.

815
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,130
Zoom button where?

816
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:03,870
Indy would be less suspicious as a priest if he were wrestling...

817
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:06,590
for the orphans instead.

818
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:07,030
True.

819
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:08,590
Okay, here we go.

820
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:11,810
Oh.

821
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,050
He's not gonna care though, right?

822
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,990
I'm just a parkouring priest.

823
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:19,710
See, he's relaxed.

824
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:23,110
What is... what is that?

825
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:26,830
Why is that shining?

826
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:29,130
What does that mean?

827
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:33,810
It's taking my interests.

828
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:35,230
I'm like a bird?

829
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:38,090
I'm like a bird.

830
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,290
It's the fast travel spot?

831
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:43,430
Oh, that's all that it means?

832
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:44,790
That's kinda lame.

833
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:49,050
Alright guys, as soon as we enter here, we're in bad...

834
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:49,170
Bad.

835
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,440
I think I missed.

836
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,800
I think I missed you guys.

837
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,940
Okay, as soon as we're in here...

838
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,720
We're in a restricted area.

839
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,160
Oh gosh, I'm scared.

840
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,100
Picture?

841
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:33,920
At a time like this?

842
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,400
Okay.

843
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,380
Now is not the time, Indy.

844
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,180
Anybody around?

845
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,340
I might have to punch people.

846
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:53,460
Just saying.

847
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,180
Oh shit, there's a guy up there.

848
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,700
Okay, we're fine.

849
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,480
Just gonna keep going down.

850
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,900
I think I hear some whispering.

851
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,680
They might notice me.

852
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,600
Let's just keep going.

853
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,560
Opens from the other side.

854
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,050
Holy moly, this place is craziness.

855
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,600
There, it's your birthday!

856
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,840
Happy birthday to you.

857
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,500
Wait, I heard a sneeze.

858
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,040
Happy birthday to you.

859
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,460
Happy birthday dear Vert.

860
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,120
Where do you pronounce it, Vert?

861
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:54,620
Happy birthday to you.

862
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,720
Happy birthday!

863
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,760
That's the place I'm trying to get past, right?

864
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,260
Do you think they'll notice?

865
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:10,590
Okay, I think now I can go.

866
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,150
Because they're not looking this way anymore.

867
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:18,970
Oh, nevermind.

868
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:19,830
That's not where...

869
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:23,530
Nevermind.

870
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:30,310
Reverse, reverse.

871
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:32,190
Reverse, reverse.

872
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:35,430
Okay, so...

873
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:38,570
Why am I in here anyway?

874
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,270
I don't remember.

875
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,880
How do I grab things?

876
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,200
Is this still restricted?

877
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:57,520
Absolutely.

878
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:58,600
Oh yes!

879
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,280
Yes, the excavation site!

880
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,040
That's right!

881
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,280
Oh my god.

882
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,160
Oh no, this place is crawling!

883
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,040
Okay, hold on.

884
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,240
I have a map.

885
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,960
Yeah, I don't remember how to check it.

886
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:17,230
Wait...

887
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:20,490
No...

888
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:22,270
Heal...

889
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:23,950
And then I... I think it's B.

890
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:26,230
It's X.

891
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:27,690
It's A.

892
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:29,530
It's trigger.

893
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:30,410
Yes.

894
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:33,810
Nice.

895
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:39,150
Oh, cards.

896
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:42,070
Okay.

897
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:43,070
No!

898
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:52,090
Why is this a bad zone?

899
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:54,410
Why is this...

900
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,910
Dammit, I'm just a priest watching over stuff.

901
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:02,710
X.

902
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:05,390
No...

903
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:07,330
Nothing is going on over here.

904
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:10,350
Maybe he'll come in here and I can wham him.

905
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:14,050
Grab a shovel to blend in.

906
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:15,210
I'm just an employee.

907
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:20,010
Everybody?

908
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,150
There's guys everywhere here.

909
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:34,470
How the hell am I supposed to blend in?

910
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:36,430
Do you think I need to change?

911
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:38,670
Hey, I meant to love the concert.

912
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:39,290
Thanks AK!

913
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:43,750
The music is so indie.

914
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,180
We'll wait for this guy to go away.

915
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,340
And then I'm gonna go blam this man.

916
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:05,270
There's a black shirt disguise, but I don't think you can access it yet.

917
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:06,010
No!

918
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,170
Surely the DLC that I paid extra money for...

919
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:14,030
Will give me extra...

920
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:15,130
What's it called?

921
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:15,450
It's two.

922
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:20,350
I'm looking through.

923
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:22,010
This guy doesn't leave.

924
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,110
What sounds weird?

925
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,380
I think I did it.

926
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:39,490
Oh no!

927
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,280
No, it's not...

928
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:52,260
His face!

929
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,300
Anyway.

930
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:56,860
Comrade down!

931
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,780
And the crowd goes mild!

932
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,660
Nobody does a damn thing.

933
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:05,080
Nobody cares.

934
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:06,140
Perfect.

935
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,120
Picture what?

936
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,080
What am I taking a picture of?

937
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:10,820
This?

938
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:12,320
No!

939
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:13,100
My thing!

940
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,180
Where is my...

941
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:14,720
No, no, no.

942
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:15,220
Put it away.

943
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,480
Where is my...

944
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,720
No, I don't want my fists.

945
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,000
Where is my...

946
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,160
Oh.

947
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:21,640
Why is it in the wall?

948
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,260
Damn sword in this town.

949
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,160
What's going...

950
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:40,950
What am I taking a picture of?

951
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:42,610
Oh my God!

952
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:43,090
Oh my God!

953
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:43,570
Oh my God!

954
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:44,170
Oh my God!

955
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:44,610
Oh my God!

956
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:45,010
Where did he go?

957
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:45,390
Where did he...

958
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:45,670
Wait.

959
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,440
Wasn't there a way to peek?

960
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:53,400
Or am I crazy?

961
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,200
This guy is really stiff.

962
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,340
He's fine though, probably.

963
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:00,140
Alright, we're looking for Giuseppe, right?

964
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,840
Just gonna go wait for this guy...

965
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,540
To turn around.

966
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:15,960
Yeah.

967
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,780
And you're all by yourself, buddy.

968
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:21,420
Oh.

969
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,280
What was that?

970
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:25,600
Nothing.

971
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,740
I'm gonna take out this entire place.

972
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:31,880
At this point.

973
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,720
What am I taking a picture of?

974
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,460
This one?

975
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,280
That's what I thought.

976
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:36,500
Okay.

977
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,120
Nice.

978
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,820
Sixth inscription, we got it.

979
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,440
You felt that bonk?

980
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,240
Honestly, me too.

981
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:47,760
Okay.

982
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,280
He's kind of stupid.

983
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,700
Look at his hands.

984
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,740
Look at the way their hands are.

985
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,960
What if I just sneak up and...

986
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:07,900
Anyway.

987
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,380
See, that's what I mean guys.

988
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:19,980
Who needs stealth when you have this?

989
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:26,960
Who needs stealth when I can just knock everybody out?

990
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,160
Don't yell.

991
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:34,580
Indy!

992
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,100
Indy, what the hell?

993
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,340
We're trying to be sneaky.

994
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:40,420
Indy!

995
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,680
I'm just, you know, cleaning up the joint.

996
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,720
Swiss postcard.

997
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:53,360
Blank postcard depicting the Pontifical Swiss Guard.

998
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,640
Wow, it really is blank.

999
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,400
They're about the same.

1000
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,400
I don't think these guys wake up, so I think we can just kind of...

1001
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,370
Don't worry about it.

1002
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,210
I said don't worry about it.

1003
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:38,810
I keep changing weapons, by the way, because they have like a limit, you know?

1004
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:41,150
And so I...

1005
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:44,550
I am changing...

1006
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:46,050
Money.

1007
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,360
We're really just taking care of this area, huh?

1008
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,260
You're not Giuseppe, right?

1009
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,380
I sure hope not.

1010
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:11,400
I don't know what he looks like.

1011
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,580
Look at this guy.

1012
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,960
He looks really... He actually looks so relaxed.

1013
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:25,740
Okay, now I can freely just take over this land.

1014
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,680
Basically.

1015
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,480
Oh, what's this?

1016
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,500
Guards list.

1017
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,020
Giuseppe!

1018
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:34,880
Giuseppe.

1019
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,760
F.

1020
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,640
What does that mean?

1021
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,140
Wait.

1022
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:40,880
F.

1023
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,420
F.

1024
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:50,920
The sippy.

1025
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:57,960
I'll turn it up a little bit.

1026
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:58,580
It's quiet.

1027
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,600
No, not this guy!

1028
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,600
Hopefully he didn't notice all of them.

1029
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:18,240
Hopefully he didn't notice anybody asleep on the job.

1030
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,620
Stealth game says who?

1031
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,560
The whole body count out there.

1032
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,520
Are you also looking for the sippy?

1033
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,300
It's a good thing Indy doesn't pee in lockers.

1034
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,280
I think we can just take this guy out.

1035
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,540
Are they all awake again?

1036
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:53,000
Nope.

1037
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,140
Find section F.

1038
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:58,940
Cool.

1039
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,640
Oh, what's this?

1040
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:03,700
Grab that.

1041
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,160
We got to go back to that lady.

1042
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:08,360
What?

1043
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,220
How did I miss this right here?

1044
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:12,440
I'm a fool.

1045
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,640
Anything else around here?

1046
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:15,860
Some pots and pans.

1047
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:16,660
Money?

1048
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:17,920
Money.

1049
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:24,880
I love robbing.

1050
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:29,020
I'm being a robber.

1051
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,980
Section F.

1052
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:36,020
Alright, we're free to... We're not entirely free.

1053
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,860
Sneak 100.

1054
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,940
Sneak 100.

1055
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,240
Indy, that man is dead.

1056
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,240
Nice and easy.

1057
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:20,520
Goddamn.

1058
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:21,120
Oh my God.

1059
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:22,560
I got an even worse weapon.

1060
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,240
I am ready to destroy.

1061
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,300
Do I go into the... Oh so that's G.

1062
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,360
So we just got to find F.

1063
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,140
I found it!

1064
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,800
How smart am I?

1065
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:46,060
How do they... Actually, how do they get down there?

1066
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,960
Once you're down there, you never come up, apparently.

1067
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,380
Or, once you're down by me, you never come up.

1068
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,100
I think this is the easier way.

1069
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:01,620
There's a ladder.

1070
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,060
Yeah, I see.

1071
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,520
I used my eyes.

1072
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:07,740
Give me a second.

1073
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,820
Look how many weapons there are here.

1074
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:14,540
It's almost like they're tools for research or something.

1075
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,160
That would be ridiculous.

1076
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,120
Giuseppe, don't be alarmed.

1077
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,840
Even though I have a weapon.

1078
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:27,280
It's for our protection.

1079
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,640
You don't think that's him, do you?

1080
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,780
Oh, I was about to kill him.

1081
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,120
Giuseppe!

1082
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,960
Oh shit!

1083
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,080
I have the...

1084
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,260
Where's the cellar man?

1085
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,060
Oh, cellar key.

1086
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,720
Took him out in three hits.

1087
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:11,680
No more work for you.

1088
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,200
Go home.

1089
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:20,320
Anyway.

1090
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,560
Time to go.

1091
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,060
He's an archeologist, guys.

1092
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:29,140
He's not meant for combat.

1093
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:30,940
Not like us.

1094
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:33,160
We're combaters.

1095
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:33,460
Wait.

1096
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,240
I thought I heard someone.

1097
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:43,020
Must have been the wind.

1098
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,920
I was gonna see if we could go into any of the other holes, but...

1099
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:50,700
Doesn't seem to be the case.

1100
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:58,500
We are an archeologist New Game Plus.

1101
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:02,440
We downloaded the extra, you know... What's in here?

1102
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,740
Can I give you a hand there, buddy?

1103
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:17,280
No!

1104
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,220
Someone's talking.

1105
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,500
Opens from the other side.

1106
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,180
Someone still has lips.

1107
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,880
Not if I can help it.

1108
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,900
Was it this area over here maybe?

1109
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:55,020
This is not a restricted area!

1110
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:57,500
Drop the weapon, Indy.

1111
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:58,620
Nope.

1112
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:00,480
Nope.

1113
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:02,860
Nice.

1114
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,780
I don't want them to get suspicious of me.

1115
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,640
Oh my gosh.

1116
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:12,920
I'm just a priest.

1117
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,700
I'm just a priest.

1118
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:19,380
Opens from the other side.

1119
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:24,920
Oh this looks like where we...

1120
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:35,680
This looks like the thing we walked along before when we were trying to meet up with the guy.

1121
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:41,130
I don't think we missed anything.

1122
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:42,810
Bless you.

1123
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:46,010
I'm psychic?

1124
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:47,290
Perhaps?

1125
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:50,950
What's this?

1126
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,090
Oh yeah!

1127
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:57,090
80 euros.

1128
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:59,010
Let's go.

1129
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:02,410
Can I use the binoculars?

1130
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:03,450
No!

1131
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:05,230
Money baby.

1132
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:08,290
How is the audio?

1133
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:09,550
I feel like it's very quiet.

1134
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:10,630
I wonder if I can turn it up.

1135
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,080
It is quiet.

1136
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:27,540
Oh I turned... Oh wait, no I had them on.

1137
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,440
Maybe I just turn this up to like 85.

1138
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:47,770
Well, I do have headphones on.

1139
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:50,510
We'll do speakers though.

1140
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:52,750
It's all good.

1141
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:56,810
Actually, I'm gonna do headphones just in case I hear them like...

1142
01:07:56,810 --> 01:07:58,630
Like if they do left right, you know?

1143
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:00,330
Then I can know where somebody is coming from.

1144
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:03,170
Just sneezed and then got hit with the bless you.

1145
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:05,170
I know.

1146
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:08,630
Is this restricted area?

1147
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:09,470
No, we're safe.

1148
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:10,890
Wow!

1149
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:13,830
Indy, you don't want to take a picture?

1150
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:15,850
This isn't a proper view for you?

1151
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:21,130
Guy has such specific tastes.

1152
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:28,050
Travel to Castel Sant'Angelo.

1153
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:30,490
Do I need to go there?

1154
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:34,330
My

1155
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:43,210
bad.

1156
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:44,590
There's like the journal.

1157
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:47,610
I don't understand.

1158
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:48,430
I don't remember.

1159
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:50,870
You start from there at night, yeah.

1160
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:52,790
Select.

1161
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,370
Thank you!

1162
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:56,830
Oh my gosh, you saved me.

1163
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:00,770
Down there.

1164
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:06,550
That was that area.

1165
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:07,490
Okay, we know where to go.

1166
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:11,370
We know where to go.

1167
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:14,670
I can get down from here.

1168
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:15,070
Perfect.

1169
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:19,150
I was gonna say, I have to go back through that one area.

1170
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:20,750
But I guess not.

1171
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:28,690
Alright.

1172
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:37,880
I still don't understand exactly how to...

1173
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,560
It won't let me whip it from over here though.

1174
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,280
Okay, I'm gonna go real slow.

1175
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,060
Okay, Indy.

1176
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:58,680
Drop.

1177
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:00,300
Down.

1178
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,100
Stupid.

1179
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:07,500
We're fine!

1180
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:10,740
Everything...

1181
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:12,750
is...

1182
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,880
so fine.

1183
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,320
Everything is Gucci.

1184
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,800
What's in here?

1185
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:22,500
Where?

1186
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:24,820
What did I stumble upon?

1187
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,280
Tower of Nicholas V?

1188
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,240
Find the underworld gate.

1189
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:36,040
Oh, I just...

1190
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,400
This is where I'm supposed to go?

1191
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,500
I might be a genius.

1192
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:47,180
It's not restricted though, so...

1193
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:47,800
What's over here?

1194
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,080
Hello?

1195
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:01,900
Oh, camera.

1196
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:08,330
My adventurer points.

1197
01:11:09,370 --> 01:11:11,770
Oh, so there was two ways to come in it seems.

1198
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:13,290
Through here.

1199
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:15,030
No.

1200
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:20,250
There is one way to come in it seems.

1201
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:31,170
Don't worry about it.

1202
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:34,430
Any rare secret treasures?

1203
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:36,470
Okay.

1204
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:39,450
Oh, what?

1205
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:39,910
No!

1206
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:41,890
I was correct.

1207
01:11:44,330 --> 01:11:46,570
There were two ways.

1208
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:48,190
See?

1209
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:50,790
Good morning.

1210
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:52,570
Good morning.

1211
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:54,030
This is where... Hold on.

1212
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:56,310
The post office, right?

1213
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:00,090
Find the address.

1214
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:02,150
Wait, then what the hell was I doing in there?

1215
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:04,930
What?

1216
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,660
I thought I found out where I needed to go.

1217
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:14,680
Buongiorno!

1218
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:16,460
What's the hot secret?

1219
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:23,320
Why do you look at me like that?

1220
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:36,140
Fresca.

1221
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:37,900
Hello.

1222
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,800
Come on, Indy.

1223
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:42,980
You can at least try.

1224
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:50,520
You can at least try to say something in Italian.

1225
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,940
You clearly know how to speak it.

1226
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:55,120
This room is freaky.

1227
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:57,440
These are freaky.

1228
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,420
I don't like these.

1229
01:12:59,420 --> 01:12:59,480
What's this?

1230
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:04,900
Strange mural.

1231
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,960
Yeah, the weeping angels.

1232
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:12,940
Yes, yes, yes.

1233
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,060
That's what they're like.

1234
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,540
They look so sad.

1235
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:21,750
I'm sad.

1236
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,170
I don't have a maiden.

1237
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:31,070
I've got a big key.

1238
01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:33,550
No one to open my heart.

1239
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:35,370
What does this say?

1240
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:38,490
What were you reaching for, Indy?

1241
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:39,330
What are you trying to grab?

1242
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:40,950
The candle.

1243
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:42,650
No, we don't need that.

1244
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:54,630
What's over here?

1245
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:57,430
Did those guys leave?

1246
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:00,330
Are you just going to let me wander?

1247
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:03,710
Lucky me.

1248
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,200
I spoke too soon.

1249
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,820
I'm in the sewers.

1250
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:18,420
Can I get back up once I go down?

1251
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:21,540
Wait, there was a picture.

1252
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,520
Sewer bridge.

1253
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:33,480
Stinky sewers.

1254
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:34,520
So disgusting.

1255
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:36,000
Requires sewers key.

1256
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:37,880
What are you?

1257
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:38,620
Are you asleep?

1258
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,260
You got the sewers key.

1259
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:45,150
I'll make sure you never wake up.

1260
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:50,370
This guy has to have the sewers key.

1261
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:36,040
That guy did not have the sewers key.

1262
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:36,400
Yeah.

1263
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:55,500
Yeah, he'll just be a little discombobulated.

1264
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:55,960
Exactly!

1265
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,080
Exactly!

1266
01:15:58,980 --> 01:15:59,540
Alright.

1267
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,780
I'm not a suspicious guy.

1268
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:04,120
I'm not a suspicious guy.

1269
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:05,120
I'm a guy.

1270
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:08,680
Oh, what am I doing?

1271
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:13,880
Oh my god, come on.

1272
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:17,740
He noticed me so fast.

1273
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:29,880
Everybody knows though that I'm... or rather they're supposed to know that I'm a guy from the United States, right?

1274
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,460
Maybe that's not... like that I'm visiting from out of town.

1275
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:36,560
I'm an out of towner.

1276
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:37,760
Oh, what's this?

1277
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,020
Mystery note.

1278
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:40,000
Angry note.

1279
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,520
Do not throw coins into the sewer grate.

1280
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:43,940
It is not a wishing well.

1281
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:46,420
If Antonio tells you otherwise, he is a liar.

1282
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:47,580
This is the Vatican.

1283
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,220
Have some respect for God.

1284
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:52,540
And for me, the man who has to clean up when the sewer gets blocked.

1285
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,080
Kindly, Ernesto.

1286
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:57,960
Greetings.

1287
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:03,660
Poor Ernesto.

1288
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,560
He's just trying to do his job.

1289
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,200
Wait, this guy I think is a captain.

1290
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:09,360
I leave.

1291
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:19,680
Do anything!

1292
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,200
Are

1293
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:31,270
they throwing things at me?

1294
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,580
I died.

1295
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:47,420
Oh my god, he's coming this way.

1296
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1297
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,500
It's not a great day.

1298
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:53,380
Actually.

1299
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:55,240
It's a really stinking day.

1300
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,760
Let's go back through here.

1301
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,000
Actually.

1302
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:08,160
Oh, if I go through here, I can avoid him since he's making his little way down the road.

1303
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:09,140
Perfect.

1304
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:17,170
Let's see.

1305
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:18,410
Through here.

1306
01:18:20,290 --> 01:18:21,470
Is running illegal?

1307
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:23,750
Just kidding!

1308
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:25,610
This guy!

1309
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:27,970
But the...

1310
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,370
Place I need to go was locked.

1311
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:36,170
Or rather...

1312
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:37,810
Hello.

1313
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:45,580
Okay.

1314
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,880
I'm also conversing.

1315
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:52,180
We're so short!

1316
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:57,220
Isn't Harrison Ford... Wait, no.

1317
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,740
I'm thinking of... I think Tom Cruise is not a very tall guy.

1318
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,120
Screw this guy.

1319
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:06,880
Wait, take a picture.

1320
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:08,520
Am I taking a picture?

1321
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:11,280
Hello.

1322
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:13,500
Cobblestone workers.

1323
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:15,340
Hold on.

1324
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:16,620
I don't think I have time.

1325
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:17,380
I gotta go.

1326
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:18,800
Time to go.

1327
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:29,880
I remember I took out some guys here before.

1328
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,100
Good times.

1329
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:32,140
Nice.

1330
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:43,450
They're birds!

1331
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:48,110
Birds have no respect.

1332
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:52,430
I'll sell our key.

1333
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:00,920
I'm in.

1334
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:03,440
Shut the door.

1335
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:05,380
Nevermind.

1336
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:05,900
Who cares.

1337
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:10,660
Stone fragment.

1338
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:14,320
How about a vintage anime figurine?

1339
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:17,300
Hold on, hold on.

1340
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,640
Before we do, let's look around a little bit more.

1341
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,600
Picture.

1342
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,840
Hey, that looks... That looks like we can beat that in.

1343
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,340
Oh, a strange inscription.

1344
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:36,640
Nice.

1345
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:39,060
Seventh inscription.

1346
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,480
We're killing it, you guys!

1347
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,300
Guess there's nothing else in here.

1348
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,060
How boring.

1349
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:46,720
What?

1350
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:47,860
You don't want the pottery?

1351
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:49,740
Oh, wait.

1352
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:51,180
I lied!

1353
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,540
If I...

1354
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:06,220
If I were a guy...

1355
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:09,880
$69.69.

1356
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:11,880
$69.69.

1357
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,140
You think it'll explode on me?

1358
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:30,020
This is my instinct.

1359
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,240
Actually, it kind of sounds nice.

1360
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:34,060
Like an ASMR.

1361
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:35,640
Am I good?

1362
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:36,160
Okay, wait.

1363
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:36,620
Hold on.

1364
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:50,220
That is a nice sound, though.

1365
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:52,580
Thank you for being awesome.

1366
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:53,000
Keep it up.

1367
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:53,940
Thanks, Yoshi!

1368
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,120
Maybe there's a clue somewhere close.

1369
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,180
Water!

1370
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:01,920
I looked around.

1371
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:02,260
Wait.

1372
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,200
That's just some...

1373
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,600
Clue.

1374
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,620
Clue.

1375
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:11,200
Weapon.

1376
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,080
Weapons.

1377
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:14,760
What?

1378
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:16,640
No clue.

1379
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:19,960
Clue.

1380
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:21,120
Clue.

1381
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:23,880
Clue.

1382
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:25,040
Clue.

1383
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:25,460
Clue.

1384
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:31,070
Clue.

1385
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:39,340
The cane?

1386
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,240
We can pry it open.

1387
01:22:59,070 --> 01:22:59,830
Clue.

1388
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:02,510
I don't want to grab it just yet.

1389
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:05,310
Is there anything on the ceiling?

1390
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:13,790
Isn't that the fragment?

1391
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:18,610
Yeah, but I feel like it might trigger something, so I wanted to...

1392
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:22,750
I wanted to get the chest open first.

1393
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:24,970
You think it's...

1394
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:31,840
I think it's...

1395
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:35,540
8008.

1396
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:41,020
I don't think it has any writing on it.

1397
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:51,380
Um...

1398
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:52,340
I don't know.

1399
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:54,640
I don't see anything.

1400
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:56,120
I really don't.

1401
01:23:58,280 --> 01:23:58,800
Oh well.

1402
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:13,820
Disgusting.

1403
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:22,520
The Great Circle.

1404
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:33,790
Do you have any idea how old that was?

1405
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,940
That's for the vase.

1406
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:07,280
Apparently he does.

1407
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,100
Wait, do you have a clue?

1408
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,000
I put the money in the lockbox.

1409
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:16,320
Pick it up when it's your turn to move artifacts from the dig site.

1410
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,600
By the way, the captain changed the code again.

1411
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,700
November lasts a year.

1412
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:26,230
Oh!

1413
01:25:26,410 --> 01:25:29,430
Uh-oh!

1414
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:31,210
Yay!

1415
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:36,590
November... Wait, what year is it?

1416
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:43,790
November 11th... Wait, would it be the date first or...

1417
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:46,550
Let's try 3611.

1418
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:50,290
No!

1419
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:52,430
This thing is so sensitive.

1420
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:56,990
Ok, 11.

1421
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:12,180
Gibby!

1422
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,780
Street Scrapper 1.

1423
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:20,440
Congrats on the S concert.

1424
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:21,780
Thank you!

1425
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:27,280
I wasn't able to go due to work, but I'll def make one someday.

1426
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:27,700
Yeah!

1427
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:29,020
I'll see you there, Jay!

1428
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:29,240
Yay!

1429
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:37,780
Increase damage with one or two handed melee weapons.

1430
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:38,200
Nice.

1431
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:41,440
I'm the street scrapper.

1432
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:43,860
99.

1433
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:46,560
He looks so peaceful.

1434
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,200
Ok.

1435
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:51,400
Anyway.

1436
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:54,300
Time to go.

1437
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:55,900
Return the stone fragment.

1438
01:26:55,900 --> 01:27:01,280
Oh yeah, we gotta go take it to our friendly... that other dude.

1439
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:04,600
Yeah, the professor.

1440
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,680
Oh wait, wait, wait...

1441
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,080
There was this here.

1442
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:11,900
I'm gonna...

1443
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:14,820
Bandage.

1444
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:17,220
Use.

1445
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,560
And grab.

1446
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:22,660
There we go.

1447
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,880
That other guy is gone, so...

1448
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:37,520
Where do you see the...

1449
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,040
Over here.

1450
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:45,860
Yeah, we can go exchange some of the medicine bottles we've been getting.

1451
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:49,060
For some groovy stuff.

1452
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,060
Let's see what she's got.

1453
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:52,260
Madam.

1454
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:58,230
I can get some moxie.

1455
01:27:58,530 --> 01:27:59,850
Or moxie.

1456
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:01,850
Or... moxie!

1457
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:04,190
Or... shaping up.

1458
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:10,270
I think I want some moxie.

1459
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:17,180
I have just enough for the moxie.

1460
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:22,380
Extend stamina bar and improve overall cardio fitness.

1461
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:23,480
Oh, hell yeah!

1462
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:29,840
So I sing at Event Horizon and the wisps were so hyped I had to go to the concert too.

1463
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:31,900
Thank you, Serge!

1464
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:33,680
Had a great time at both.

1465
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:34,700
Thanks for the great show.

1466
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:37,020
Oh my gosh, thank you!

1467
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:40,920
Maybe it was good advertising then.

1468
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,580
Increase health reserve by adding...

1469
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:50,500
I feel like I have... What is she typing on?

1470
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:51,060
Ma'am?

1471
01:28:59,650 --> 01:29:01,290
There's nothing there.

1472
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:06,110
This place is a little haunted, I think, you guys.

1473
01:29:09,070 --> 01:29:10,850
The devil has her.

1474
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:14,930
I think I might want an extra health bar, I'm not gonna lie.

1475
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:18,610
Because having only three is like... oof.

1476
01:29:23,330 --> 01:29:24,770
And then...

1477
01:29:25,650 --> 01:29:26,830
Increase health reserve.

1478
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:30,130
So all of these are basically the same thing.

1479
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:36,890
We've already taken a picture of this cat, but look how cute he is.

1480
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:42,410
Hold on, I'm gonna get a really artsy picture.

1481
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:47,370
This is so cute!

1482
01:29:49,330 --> 01:29:51,010
You are handsome!

1483
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:58,020
She's a ghost rider?

1484
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:01,400
Alright.

1485
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:07,850
Sorry,

1486
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,500
I keep opening it up because I'm like...

1487
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:17,740
Oh okay, we just follow the little thingies and he'll lead us back home.

1488
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:30,990
Alright, there is a guy here that wants to kill me.

1489
01:30:33,290 --> 01:30:34,690
But we'll just ignore him.

1490
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:38,710
We're going inside here, I believe.

1491
01:30:40,050 --> 01:30:40,590
Hello!

1492
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:43,050
Buongiorno!

1493
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:44,610
Hello!

1494
01:30:48,170 --> 01:30:49,670
Everybody is talking over each other.

1495
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:50,530
We're in the right place, right?

1496
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:52,030
Yeah, yeah.

1497
01:30:56,690 --> 01:30:57,230
Okay.

1498
01:31:01,710 --> 01:31:02,310
Plus two.

1499
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:03,010
What?

1500
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:03,970
What did you say?

1501
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:06,310
Oh, the ghost rider.

1502
01:31:06,310 --> 01:31:09,330
That is a good joke.

1503
01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:10,030
I'll admit.

1504
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:15,370
You have the workings of a dad.

1505
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:20,130
Indy, are you okay?

1506
01:31:25,870 --> 01:31:26,810
Do

1507
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:32,640
I give it to you?

1508
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:34,400
Antonio?

1509
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:44,620
What?

1510
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:49,660
Don't speak to me in riddles, weirdo.

1511
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:51,200
Oh there!

1512
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,720
I walked right past him!

1513
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:53,540
Two!

1514
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:55,280
Hold on.

1515
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:57,920
I'm going to turn up the volume a little bit more.

1516
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:04,520
And then I'm going to turn it down on my end.

1517
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:07,260
Since I have it like extra high on my thing.

1518
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:14,250
That wasn't a riddle, but it was his cadence, you know?

1519
01:32:14,450 --> 01:32:16,610
He was like, go to the tower of Nicholas V.

1520
01:32:17,010 --> 01:32:19,690
There you will find what lies beneath.

1521
01:32:21,350 --> 01:32:22,150
Sunday girl!

1522
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:24,010
Thanks for the 8 months.

1523
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:26,750
Speaking of cats, I'm glad Butaro is doing well.

1524
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:29,770
Also, did Pies get mad when you left her for a few days?

1525
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:31,250
No, she was fine.

1526
01:32:32,010 --> 01:32:33,990
Butaro is doing alright, yeah.

1527
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:40,770
He is... For those who don't know, my cat had to get some surgery.

1528
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:42,910
He had a little thing on his arm.

1529
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:45,990
I took him to get surgery...

1530
01:32:49,370 --> 01:32:50,750
This... Wait, no.

1531
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:51,290
Yesterday.

1532
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:52,610
I was like, this morning.

1533
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:53,590
No, that's not right.

1534
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:57,650
Yesterday...

1535
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:01,290
And... Does he have a cone?

1536
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:02,250
He does have a cone.

1537
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:03,130
He has a donut.

1538
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:11,570
But... I'm worried about him a little bit because his arm or his paw has been a little bit swollen.

1539
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:18,110
But they are saying that if it gets any bigger, then that's cause for worry.

1540
01:33:18,330 --> 01:33:19,730
But it doesn't seem to be getting bigger.

1541
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:22,290
It seems to be not swelling.

1542
01:33:22,970 --> 01:33:24,370
It seems to be going down a little bit.

1543
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:26,710
But he is my little guy.

1544
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:30,090
And he has just been so grumpy.

1545
01:33:30,610 --> 01:33:31,150
Oh my god.

1546
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:35,810
He has been kind of hellish to deal with because he has been so grumpy.

1547
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:39,370
But I understand why he is grumpy.

1548
01:33:40,110 --> 01:33:42,170
Hey, I got your rock.

1549
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:46,130
Professor, it's him who saved me.

1550
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:48,750
Father Gallagher?

1551
01:33:49,970 --> 01:33:53,650
I say, thank you for rescuing poor Sidney.

1552
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:55,470
Why are you poking him like that?

1553
01:33:56,570 --> 01:33:57,090
There you go.

1554
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:01,450
My word.

1555
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:04,230
You found it.

1556
01:34:05,150 --> 01:34:06,610
What do you make of it, sir?

1557
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:13,190
Well, my bet would be it's a stone fragment of the epitaph from the tomb of Saint Peter.

1558
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:20,970
You should have become an archaeologist, father.

1559
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:25,330
It's never that adventurous.

1560
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:39,670
Stop it!

1561
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:41,170
Xbox, go away!

1562
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:54,130
He is writing all over that book.

1563
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:58,550
Stop poking him like that.

1564
01:35:01,230 --> 01:35:03,110
Why does he do that to him?

1565
01:35:04,390 --> 01:35:05,950
Marshall College Guide.

1566
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:09,770
A guidebook concerning things of interest one can discover in Marshall College.

1567
01:35:11,830 --> 01:35:14,870
Oh, a map guide.

1568
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:16,830
I was going to say, why do we care?

1569
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:22,650
Alright, find the underworld gate.

1570
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:27,930
Yeah, that's the name of the game.

1571
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:34,330
What am I taking a photo of now?

1572
01:35:35,290 --> 01:35:37,330
There is so much... Wait, is it of the two of them?

1573
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:38,310
Oh, that's so cute!

1574
01:35:38,410 --> 01:35:39,350
Wait, of him poking him.

1575
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:49,930
Anyway, through here...

1576
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:57,230
Is Antonio still trying to talk to me, but like all the way up there?

1577
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:01,270
Like, calm down, man.

1578
01:36:01,450 --> 01:36:03,410
I'm trying to do the thing.

1579
01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:06,930
Antonio is just like...

1580
01:36:08,570 --> 01:36:11,490
Oh my god, he's still talking to me!

1581
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:22,920
I can't, I'm going crazy!

1582
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:27,000
This town is cursed, the devil is inside me!

1583
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I mean...

1584
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:36,620
It's like I can still hear his voice.

1585
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,600
Antonio, speak to me!

1586
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,380
I wonder if he'll talk again.

1587
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:52,700
Oh, I hear a cat.

1588
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:56,140
I don't think it's this cat over here.

1589
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:58,340
Actually, it might be.

1590
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:00,260
Is our typewriter back?

1591
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:04,760
Thank you for the 10 gifted!

1592
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,000
This town is cursed.

1593
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:08,520
This city.

1594
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:12,200
There is something very devilish going on here.

1595
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:20,980
Oh, that's the guy we are supposed to avoid, isn't it?

1596
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:24,460
I'm just a priest.

1597
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:26,200
Turn around!

1598
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:28,660
Turn around!

1599
01:37:34,930 --> 01:37:36,490
Maybe it's not.

1600
01:37:39,150 --> 01:37:41,950
Or they are going to be like, you can't go this way again.

1601
01:37:46,690 --> 01:37:47,610
Just kidding.

1602
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:48,990
Oh, it's that guy!

1603
01:37:58,250 --> 01:37:59,270
Uh-oh.

1604
01:38:02,270 --> 01:38:03,970
Yeah, that's right.

1605
01:38:04,370 --> 01:38:05,710
You don't notice me.

1606
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:10,680
OK.

1607
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:12,940
We are all good.

1608
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,240
Into this room.

1609
01:38:21,110 --> 01:38:22,170
This freaky room.

1610
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:24,110
Into the freaky room.

1611
01:38:25,050 --> 01:38:25,950
The freaky room.

1612
01:38:28,990 --> 01:38:30,870
Oh my god.

1613
01:38:32,310 --> 01:38:33,270
This is it.

1614
01:38:35,770 --> 01:38:36,410
Kiss.

1615
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:50,950
What do you want me to do?

1616
01:38:55,870 --> 01:38:58,470
I thought it was like, you know.

1617
01:38:59,830 --> 01:39:01,670
A true love's kiss will wake him up.

1618
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:04,890
Smash.

1619
01:39:08,190 --> 01:39:09,630
I guess we can smash.

1620
01:39:09,730 --> 01:39:11,490
Smash or pass.

1621
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:15,090
Not that.

1622
01:39:15,310 --> 01:39:18,010
We can only use certain items.

1623
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:21,070
Oh my gosh.

1624
01:39:21,310 --> 01:39:22,330
Where are all the items?

1625
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:27,330
Where are all the weapon items?

1626
01:39:29,410 --> 01:39:29,890
Hello?

1627
01:39:33,730 --> 01:39:34,450
What?

1628
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:36,230
Huh?

1629
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,980
It won't even let me pick up a dang bottle.

1630
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:46,840
Oh my god.

1631
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,560
I thought that one was moving.

1632
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:55,580
I wouldn't put it past Indiana Jones to make this kind of freaky though.

1633
01:39:57,340 --> 01:39:58,960
Can I borrow that?

1634
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:03,300
We are being forcibly...oh wait.

1635
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:05,680
Bottle of wine.

1636
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:10,380
I was going to say they are forcing us to pass.

1637
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:18,500
That is the thickest wine I've ever seen.

1638
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:37,600
Rotate.

1639
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:41,520
Rotate.

1640
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:44,020
I sure hope I'm rotating it the right way.

1641
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:48,740
Oh!

1642
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:54,140
Now it looks like he is on top of the devil.

1643
01:40:59,370 --> 01:41:00,790
Explore the underworld.

1644
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:03,190
It's not ominous at all.

1645
01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:06,590
Oh wait.

1646
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:08,050
There was a candle here.

1647
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:10,690
Nice.

1648
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:16,300
We can't even go that way.

1649
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:17,740
Where?

1650
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:18,240
What?

1651
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:21,600
Here we go.

1652
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:24,660
The rats the size of horses.

1653
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:26,620
Said those guys.

1654
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:30,040
So how did no one ever think to do that before?

1655
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:32,120
Is my question.

1656
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:37,240
Like how did anybody see that and be like...

1657
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:39,360
Oh my gosh.

1658
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:40,040
Indy be careful.

1659
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:45,480
I need to...oh this thing that looks like a sink?

1660
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:47,800
Oh my god.

1661
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:48,340
That scared me.

1662
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:49,680
This thing that looks like a sink?

1663
01:41:49,820 --> 01:41:51,660
I'm just gonna pour something into it.

1664
01:41:56,790 --> 01:41:57,330
Oh.

1665
01:41:57,690 --> 01:41:58,830
Why is it so shiny?

1666
01:42:00,370 --> 01:42:02,010
Time out corner for you.

1667
01:42:02,930 --> 01:42:03,830
Can I light the candle?

1668
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:04,170
No.

1669
01:42:05,210 --> 01:42:06,790
Ancient candle cannot be lit.

1670
01:42:09,510 --> 01:42:12,230
Oh this looks ominous you guys.

1671
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:16,470
Did you hear that?

1672
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:20,290
Press LT to raise the flame and see better.

1673
01:42:21,790 --> 01:42:22,750
Catch that.

1674
01:42:23,510 --> 01:42:24,630
Take this instead.

1675
01:42:25,230 --> 01:42:25,530
Nice.

1676
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:34,330
It's sure looking ominous here guys.

1677
01:42:35,770 --> 01:42:36,550
Light that Indy.

1678
01:42:37,070 --> 01:42:37,530
Light it.

1679
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:38,550
Light it.

1680
01:42:39,510 --> 01:42:41,130
Light that Indy.

1681
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:41,690
Indy.

1682
01:42:42,570 --> 01:42:43,450
Oh there we go.

1683
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:49,980
Light.

1684
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:50,620
Nice.

1685
01:42:58,060 --> 01:42:59,980
Oh zoinks Scoob.

1686
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:02,880
I think there's some pretty gnarly things in here.

1687
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:19,500
There's nothing in here.

1688
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:19,760
Ok.

1689
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:21,160
Oh.

1690
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:23,080
Ancient technology.

1691
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:30,530
The light in here was pretty cool.

1692
01:43:34,510 --> 01:43:35,230
Ok.

1693
01:43:35,690 --> 01:43:36,430
Let's take a picture.

1694
01:43:38,230 --> 01:43:40,030
This one is for the history book.

1695
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:41,530
Sacred wounds mural.

1696
01:43:49,950 --> 01:43:50,430
Wait.

1697
01:43:50,810 --> 01:43:51,430
Where did my...

1698
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:54,810
Let's pick that up please.

1699
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:56,690
Oh the bottle of wine.

1700
01:43:56,790 --> 01:43:57,070
Hold on.

1701
01:43:57,190 --> 01:43:57,310
Hold on.

1702
01:43:57,370 --> 01:43:58,430
Before we do that...

1703
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:03,230
I'm gonna...

1704
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:03,590
Oh.

1705
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:04,250
Just kidding.

1706
01:44:04,690 --> 01:44:05,710
Be careful with it Indy.

1707
01:44:07,150 --> 01:44:08,710
That works too.

1708
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:13,870
Just be careful with the antique bus you know.

1709
01:44:14,810 --> 01:44:15,330
Wait.

1710
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:16,390
Oh there's another picture.

1711
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:20,930
Holy chalice.

1712
01:44:21,890 --> 01:44:23,670
Holy chalice.

1713
01:44:30,230 --> 01:44:33,750
And then this one is...

1714
01:44:36,970 --> 01:44:39,830
This one is walking on water.

1715
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:47,470
Oh.

1716
01:44:51,130 --> 01:44:51,490
Ok there.

1717
01:44:52,070 --> 01:44:54,870
Sometimes it disappears and sometimes it doesn't.

1718
01:44:55,570 --> 01:44:57,170
We can't go in here quite yet.

1719
01:45:00,490 --> 01:45:01,350
What the?

1720
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:05,380
I thought I heard someone.

1721
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:10,140
I thought I heard someone go...

1722
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:13,420
Like Naruto?

1723
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:14,220
Exactly.

1724
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:32,200
I didn't do the wine.

1725
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:32,840
No!

1726
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:36,460
What if I do wine here?

1727
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:37,260
Oh maybe...

1728
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:38,560
You know what?

1729
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:39,620
Let's try it with the fire.

1730
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:42,220
Pour it in baby.

1731
01:45:54,970 --> 01:45:55,130
Oh.

1732
01:45:55,550 --> 01:45:56,310
I thought I said H.

1733
01:45:58,610 --> 01:45:59,210
Two.

1734
01:45:59,790 --> 01:46:01,110
I didn't get the other one.

1735
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:02,230
I'm an idiot.

1736
01:46:03,310 --> 01:46:04,510
I'm the worst...

1737
01:46:04,510 --> 01:46:07,510
I'm the worst archeologist ever.

1738
01:46:15,390 --> 01:46:18,070
I love...I love floor torch.

1739
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:20,770
You don't want a picture of this?

1740
01:46:21,150 --> 01:46:22,290
This looks important too.

1741
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:23,530
It's literal words.

1742
01:46:25,570 --> 01:46:26,290
Indy!

1743
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:27,550
Come on!

1744
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:31,370
Use that brain of yours.

1745
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:41,890
Spear of Longinus.

1746
01:46:42,910 --> 01:46:44,770
That's what they call me at the club.

1747
01:46:54,390 --> 01:46:55,110
Open.

1748
01:46:55,830 --> 01:46:56,130
Oh wait.

1749
01:46:56,250 --> 01:46:57,330
Let's do the...

1750
01:46:58,230 --> 01:46:59,490
Let's do this again.

1751
01:46:59,710 --> 01:46:59,890
Ok.

1752
01:47:00,130 --> 01:47:01,130
Pour, pour, pour.

1753
01:47:01,290 --> 01:47:02,270
Avoid the fire.

1754
01:47:03,410 --> 01:47:04,550
Could be bad.

1755
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:08,970
Use two-handed melee weapon...items to break down fragile walls.

1756
01:47:09,730 --> 01:47:10,570
What's this one say?

1757
01:47:11,710 --> 01:47:12,230
Three.

1758
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:16,510
No!

1759
01:47:20,660 --> 01:47:22,340
This looks like a two-handed weapon.

1760
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:28,580
Indy, I'm smarter than you.

1761
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:33,040
Indy, please.

1762
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:36,120
Alright, let's use our bottle of wine here now.

1763
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:41,900
And it's a...

1764
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:42,740
Five.

1765
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:43,260
Five.

1766
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:44,300
Five.

1767
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:46,280
H2.

1768
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:46,660
Again?

1769
01:47:51,830 --> 01:47:52,510
No.

1770
01:47:52,510 --> 01:47:53,450
No, no.

1771
01:47:54,030 --> 01:47:54,870
No, please.

1772
01:47:55,670 --> 01:47:56,910
I was worried.

1773
01:47:58,530 --> 01:47:59,730
What about this one?

1774
01:47:59,830 --> 01:48:01,330
This has got to be number one.

1775
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:05,840
One.

1776
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:08,040
See!

1777
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:09,220
I knew this would happen!

1778
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:18,580
We have to keep doing this.

1779
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,880
Until there are...oh wait.

1780
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:25,040
Oh!

1781
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

1782
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:32,380
So this one is...this one is three, the spear.

1783
01:48:37,630 --> 01:48:39,230
Ah, what the hell?

1784
01:48:40,950 --> 01:48:43,010
These are...ok, wait, hold on.

1785
01:48:43,730 --> 01:48:46,270
This one is...the chalice.

1786
01:48:46,910 --> 01:48:47,690
What is that one?

1787
01:48:49,790 --> 01:48:50,690
His hands?

1788
01:48:51,350 --> 01:48:51,670
Wait.

1789
01:48:51,670 --> 01:48:56,450
And then this one was...it was two and it was his body.

1790
01:48:57,330 --> 01:48:58,470
Body, yaddy, yaddy.

1791
01:48:58,870 --> 01:49:00,330
So probably this one, right?

1792
01:49:02,990 --> 01:49:03,510
Two!

1793
01:49:05,190 --> 01:49:05,550
Ok.

1794
01:49:06,430 --> 01:49:08,510
Or wait, or would this be the spear?

1795
01:49:11,930 --> 01:49:13,450
Hold on, what about this one over here?

1796
01:49:15,590 --> 01:49:17,670
This is him walking on water, so...

1797
01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:18,030
Oh!

1798
01:49:18,250 --> 01:49:19,290
It's got...

1799
01:49:19,290 --> 01:49:21,290
It's got like a...

1800
01:49:21,870 --> 01:49:22,970
Wait, why did it do that?

1801
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:24,530
Go to the bottom.

1802
01:49:28,910 --> 01:49:30,950
It highlights which one it is.

1803
01:49:36,330 --> 01:49:36,850
Three!

1804
01:49:37,630 --> 01:49:39,190
Ok, so his left foot.

1805
01:49:39,870 --> 01:49:41,230
Or rather, his right foot.

1806
01:49:42,790 --> 01:49:44,890
His right foot, but our left foot.

1807
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:46,170
So this one is three.

1808
01:49:46,170 --> 01:49:47,170
Three.

1809
01:49:50,410 --> 01:49:51,730
Three.

1810
01:49:52,490 --> 01:49:53,010
Nice.

1811
01:49:54,330 --> 01:49:56,170
And then...

1812
01:49:59,170 --> 01:50:02,530
This one is his right hand.

1813
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:05,070
And it was two.

1814
01:50:07,230 --> 01:50:08,610
We got this.

1815
01:50:09,870 --> 01:50:10,590
Two!

1816
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:11,510
Ok.

1817
01:50:13,350 --> 01:50:14,150
Left hand.

1818
01:50:14,270 --> 01:50:15,830
Yeah, but I'm going by...

1819
01:50:15,830 --> 01:50:17,010
You know what I mean.

1820
01:50:18,010 --> 01:50:19,070
This is his left hand.

1821
01:50:19,850 --> 01:50:21,130
But it's our right hand.

1822
01:50:23,870 --> 01:50:26,310
Oh, oh, this is not the right way.

1823
01:50:26,650 --> 01:50:27,890
Oh, I just realized there's that.

1824
01:50:28,210 --> 01:50:28,550
Ok, good.

1825
01:50:30,290 --> 01:50:31,210
Stage left.

1826
01:50:32,390 --> 01:50:33,930
I'm hearing a voice!

1827
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:38,670
Sometimes it's like a...

1828
01:50:38,670 --> 01:50:39,610
It sounds like a woman.

1829
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:41,610
She's going like...

1830
01:50:46,050 --> 01:50:47,710
Do you guys not hear it?

1831
01:50:48,430 --> 01:50:49,530
This one was three.

1832
01:50:54,830 --> 01:50:56,450
And then his other hand was...

1833
01:50:56,450 --> 01:50:57,770
This one was also three, right?

1834
01:50:58,970 --> 01:50:59,550
Double checking.

1835
01:51:00,830 --> 01:51:01,350
In the game?

1836
01:51:01,450 --> 01:51:03,430
Yeah, in the game, in the game, in the game, in the game.

1837
01:51:06,370 --> 01:51:06,770
Two!

1838
01:51:06,990 --> 01:51:07,650
Oh, it was two.

1839
01:51:08,170 --> 01:51:08,830
Good thing I checked.

1840
01:51:11,710 --> 01:51:13,250
Alright, two for the other hand.

1841
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:23,450
The body is probably three.

1842
01:51:24,070 --> 01:51:24,870
Because of the spear.

1843
01:51:26,410 --> 01:51:28,630
And then we just need...

1844
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:30,470
This one.

1845
01:51:30,770 --> 01:51:31,730
But it's over here.

1846
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:40,480
Oh no!

1847
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:48,220
I don't like that!

1848
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:49,340
I don't like that!

1849
01:51:50,780 --> 01:51:52,400
I guess there's nobody here.

1850
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:06,620
Anointment of Jesus.

1851
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:14,060
I got a thing.

1852
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:17,440
I got a present from someone named Ryan who likes feet.

1853
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:22,300
And Ryan did not decide to write a letter or anything.

1854
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:27,840
Ryan decided to only send me some WeCross cards of Kiara.

1855
01:52:28,860 --> 01:52:30,320
Which is so nice.

1856
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:33,320
But Ryan also decided to...

1857
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:38,320
To write on the cards.

1858
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:45,320
The first thing he wrote was on the first card.

1859
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:49,320
The first card he...

1860
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:53,530
The first thing he wrote was...

1861
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:54,420
Wood.

1862
01:52:56,460 --> 01:52:59,600
And then on the second card...

1863
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:04,880
He very erratically circled her armpit.

1864
01:53:09,970 --> 01:53:12,310
And that was the only thing...

1865
01:53:14,110 --> 01:53:16,050
Ryan gave me.

1866
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:24,340
Four.

1867
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:27,220
Okay.

1868
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:28,980
Alright.

1869
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:34,060
I feel like there was something else that he wrote.

1870
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:35,540
Hold on, let me go grab it.

1871
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:38,620
Least Freaky Wisp.

1872
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,180
Hold on, let me grab it.

1873
01:53:53,140 --> 01:53:54,320
That's right.

1874
01:53:57,870 --> 01:54:01,660
He circled the armpit and just wrote... Peek.

1875
01:54:15,260 --> 01:54:17,180
Oh my god.

1876
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:20,200
So good.

1877
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:24,400
Make me laugh.

1878
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:26,160
I was like...

1879
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:29,080
Alright, this was four.

1880
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:34,400
I figured it was four.

1881
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:37,160
I feel like I could have brute-forced that, but...

1882
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:42,820
Because why would they have a four option and then you never use it, right?

1883
01:54:45,980 --> 01:54:46,420
But...

1884
01:54:46,420 --> 01:54:48,000
Ryan is my goal.

1885
01:54:51,140 --> 01:54:53,140
Find the warrior giant's tomb?

1886
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:55,500
I wish the game would stop spoiling it for me.

1887
01:54:56,460 --> 01:54:58,260
I don't know what I'm trying to find.

1888
01:54:58,320 --> 01:54:59,420
I've never been in here.

1889
01:55:00,220 --> 01:55:02,280
Stop telling me what I'm trying to find.

1890
01:55:03,460 --> 01:55:04,640
Wait, warrior giant?

1891
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:05,860
Like the guy.

1892
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:06,860
Wait, what is this?

1893
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:09,140
Oh no, no, I want to take that.

1894
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:12,900
Can't see anything.

1895
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:15,220
Why is it like this?

1896
01:55:16,940 --> 01:55:17,640
Oh!

1897
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:26,740
Front seating, true.

1898
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:29,820
Look at all these little skellies.

1899
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:32,500
Is this water?

1900
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:36,000
No, I think it's just...

1901
01:55:36,780 --> 01:55:37,900
Oh yeah, there's a rat.

1902
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:39,360
There's two rats.

1903
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:42,820
Rats.

1904
01:55:43,220 --> 01:55:43,700
Rats.

1905
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,580
We are the rats.

1906
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:55,680
I hear them everywhere.

1907
01:55:55,880 --> 01:55:57,380
The rats as tall as horses.

1908
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:01,640
Oh, get out of here little guy.

1909
01:56:03,260 --> 01:56:03,940
What's this?

1910
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:06,200
First room.

1911
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:08,680
Oh, there's something in there that we want?

1912
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:14,680
What do I place here?

1913
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:15,680
What do you want?

1914
01:56:15,820 --> 01:56:16,560
What do you want from me?

1915
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:26,320
That looks like a big old carrot.

1916
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:29,280
Anything in here?

1917
01:56:30,980 --> 01:56:31,300
Really?

1918
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:31,860
Nothing?

1919
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:36,660
This tomb has not been disturbed in however millennia?

1920
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,600
And we're just like, yeah, whatever.

1921
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:44,320
And he's like, once you see...

1922
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:47,440
One pot, you've seen them all.

1923
01:56:47,540 --> 01:56:48,920
Why did that turn red?

1924
01:56:54,380 --> 01:56:55,420
Why is this red?

1925
01:57:10,110 --> 01:57:10,770
This thing?

1926
01:57:14,690 --> 01:57:16,610
Oh, you scared me.

1927
01:57:18,530 --> 01:57:20,170
Oh, it scared me.

1928
01:57:22,410 --> 01:57:23,870
That's not good, we're in there.

1929
01:57:24,590 --> 01:57:27,470
Indy, we're in the thing that should burn down easily.

1930
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:31,130
Maybe he means like the thing that we just took care of, right?

1931
01:57:32,790 --> 01:57:36,110
I don't like that once we go down there, it doesn't look like we can come back up.

1932
01:57:36,390 --> 01:57:37,330
Watch out little rat!

1933
01:57:40,110 --> 01:57:41,130
What's in here?

1934
01:57:42,670 --> 01:57:43,910
Let's go this way instead.

1935
01:57:52,150 --> 01:57:53,550
Burial chamber key!

1936
01:57:54,910 --> 01:57:56,050
Ancient burial chamber.

1937
01:57:56,150 --> 01:57:58,190
That looks in really good condition.

1938
01:57:59,070 --> 01:58:01,030
Found in the catacombs underneath the Vatican.

1939
01:58:01,030 --> 01:58:03,770
I don't think you'll be needing this anymore.

1940
01:58:04,610 --> 01:58:06,050
You could have just left, man.

1941
01:58:06,170 --> 01:58:08,270
You didn't have to rot away here.

1942
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:11,210
What is...

1943
01:58:12,710 --> 01:58:14,850
This is the great circle.

1944
01:58:16,370 --> 01:58:17,630
It's very shiny.

1945
01:58:19,770 --> 01:58:23,510
See, this is how I would want to be buried.

1946
01:58:24,070 --> 01:58:25,710
I actually don't know what happened to my body.

1947
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:30,170
This looks like a cozy blanket.

1948
01:58:31,510 --> 01:58:32,170
The dirt.

1949
01:58:33,230 --> 01:58:34,490
Oh my gosh, this place is huge.

1950
01:58:35,030 --> 01:58:37,370
Do I have a map or no?

1951
01:58:38,270 --> 01:58:39,310
Not really.

1952
01:58:39,590 --> 01:58:41,270
But it is also front seating me.

1953
01:58:43,730 --> 01:58:44,910
Outer Wilds.

1954
01:58:50,050 --> 01:58:51,650
This room is a little freaky.

1955
01:58:55,670 --> 01:58:56,930
Someone might know.

1956
01:58:56,930 --> 01:58:58,790
I feel like someone has to know.

1957
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:01,870
What happened to my body?

1958
01:59:05,090 --> 01:59:06,630
And this goes up.

1959
01:59:09,130 --> 01:59:10,250
Let's go down.

1960
01:59:11,850 --> 01:59:13,730
Down into the catacombs.

1961
01:59:15,670 --> 01:59:17,590
Oh, it leads down here.

1962
01:59:17,870 --> 01:59:18,770
Gosh, it's dusty.

1963
01:59:20,250 --> 01:59:21,450
Oh, what am I taking a picture of?

1964
01:59:24,210 --> 01:59:24,810
No.

1965
01:59:25,850 --> 01:59:26,250
This?

1966
01:59:28,150 --> 01:59:28,910
Oh, the cross.

1967
01:59:29,590 --> 01:59:30,830
Jerusalem cross.

1968
01:59:36,490 --> 01:59:41,890
Sir, that is four points.

1969
01:59:43,990 --> 01:59:44,510
Okay.

1970
01:59:45,470 --> 01:59:46,370
Nothing down here.

1971
01:59:47,490 --> 01:59:48,430
Alright.

1972
01:59:48,430 --> 01:59:51,350
We are just being little adventurers.

1973
01:59:51,470 --> 01:59:52,610
Oh yeah, let's see.

1974
01:59:53,610 --> 01:59:54,850
My journal.

1975
01:59:55,930 --> 01:59:58,730
We can...

1976
01:59:58,730 --> 02:00:01,030
I think I can unlock some more books.

1977
02:00:03,750 --> 02:00:04,750
Shaping up.

1978
02:00:06,890 --> 02:00:08,730
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1979
02:00:08,770 --> 02:00:09,970
Increase health reserve.

1980
02:00:12,050 --> 02:00:12,750
Nice.

1981
02:00:13,750 --> 02:00:14,690
Lucky hat.

1982
02:00:17,450 --> 02:00:21,170
Oh, that's right.

1983
02:00:22,530 --> 02:00:23,970
I feel like I should get that one.

1984
02:00:24,030 --> 02:00:25,030
What else do we have?

1985
02:00:27,210 --> 02:00:28,590
Wait, the fitness one.

1986
02:00:29,790 --> 02:00:31,730
Drains less stamina when climbing.

1987
02:00:33,270 --> 02:00:33,730
Combat.

1988
02:00:34,690 --> 02:00:37,910
Last hit before an improvised weapon break deals additional damage.

1989
02:00:40,270 --> 02:00:43,290
Increase damage with one or two handed melee weapons.

1990
02:00:43,390 --> 02:00:44,890
Oh, that's actually pretty good too.

1991
02:00:45,310 --> 02:00:46,770
Lucky hat, isn't that good to be honest?

1992
02:00:46,850 --> 02:00:47,650
Oh no, really?

1993
02:00:56,740 --> 02:00:58,660
A guidebook concerning things...

1994
02:00:59,240 --> 02:01:00,020
Wait, what?

1995
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,120
Oh, that's just the... okay.

1996
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:07,720
Why is that in here?

1997
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:08,660
Anyway.

1998
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:12,520
Hmm...

1999
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:14,680
Lucky hat is good and cool when it happens.

2000
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:20,240
Gives second wind but not much life if you're surrounded.

2001
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,300
Ah, I see, I see.

2002
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:25,520
So it could be good in maybe like a one on one fight.

2003
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:27,940
Let's do...

2004
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:32,660
I wanna do this one because I mean I use a lot of...

2005
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:34,280
Melee weapons.

2006
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:36,920
I mean I use my fists too, but...

2007
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:37,780
Let's do this one.

2008
02:01:38,220 --> 02:01:40,300
And then I can also get lucky hat.

2009
02:01:40,380 --> 02:01:41,480
It's not so much expensive.

2010
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:44,460
There we go.

2011
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:47,920
Perfect.

2012
02:01:48,340 --> 02:01:50,520
Anyway, I'm just leveling up in the catacombs.

2013
02:01:54,820 --> 02:01:58,120
Finding my fedora will give me a second chance.

2014
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:02,140
Why do they say it like that?

2015
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:05,040
M'lady.

2016
02:02:09,060 --> 02:02:10,020
M'lady.

2017
02:02:11,540 --> 02:02:12,180
I've...

2018
02:02:13,140 --> 02:02:15,060
I've found new...

2019
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:18,680
Oh, this is the... oh, that's so funny.

2020
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:20,280
Journal page.

2021
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:23,360
Paranoid writing.

2022
02:02:23,680 --> 02:02:24,960
Oh my gosh.

2023
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:26,560
This person is a freak.

2024
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:27,480
Harken.

2025
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:30,100
I have become quarry.

2026
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:33,820
For is it not footsteps and pursuit that I hear in the abyssal dark?

2027
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:41,380
Heavy footfalls with a heavy cadence more terrible than mortal bend.

2028
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:42,380
The giant.

2029
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:46,160
Quietly they speak in the gloom.

2030
02:02:47,380 --> 02:02:51,300
What blasphemous words slip tween their lips I cannot say.

2031
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:53,480
For it is not in the tongue of man.

2032
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:55,980
Yet they refrain from drawing too close.

2033
02:02:56,560 --> 02:03:00,420
Seemingly content with observing the giant fiends of the infernal dark.

2034
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:04,420
That's from 1152.

2035
02:03:05,740 --> 02:03:06,700
It's from a journal.

2036
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:07,760
Medieval.

2037
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:08,820
Medieval.

2038
02:03:09,260 --> 02:03:10,600
Oh, we can go through here.

2039
02:03:13,580 --> 02:03:14,120
Maybe?

2040
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:15,540
Can we go...

2041
02:03:15,540 --> 02:03:17,640
Oh, I can and I'm scared.

2042
02:03:19,220 --> 02:03:21,000
Let's... hold on, there is other stuff around.

2043
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:25,240
Like in here.

2044
02:03:26,180 --> 02:03:28,840
I think that actually just leads to out here.

2045
02:03:31,060 --> 02:03:31,500
Maybe?

2046
02:03:32,180 --> 02:03:33,300
Maybe it does not.

2047
02:03:34,300 --> 02:03:35,200
Actually I can't tell.

2048
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:38,280
It looks like it for a second.

2049
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:40,380
Maybe it leads to down here.

2050
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:47,900
Yes.

2051
02:03:49,560 --> 02:03:51,360
So that goes back into this room.

2052
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:52,100
Okay, okay.

2053
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:54,240
So when we need to go back up we just go through there.

2054
02:03:56,380 --> 02:03:56,820
Boo!

2055
02:03:58,620 --> 02:04:00,200
Indy, where is your sidekick?

2056
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:02,800
Indy!

2057
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:03,800
I'm scared.

2058
02:04:05,580 --> 02:04:07,580
Indy, you have a sidekick.

2059
02:04:07,660 --> 02:04:08,140
Where are they?

2060
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:08,940
Okay, nevermind.

2061
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:14,320
We are just dusty crusty up in here.

2062
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:22,640
It didn't look like we could go.

2063
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:32,860
I'm scared of the night giants.

2064
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:39,080
Back here maybe?

2065
02:04:43,090 --> 02:04:44,090
Squeak, squeak, squeaking.

2066
02:04:45,170 --> 02:04:46,570
Squeak, squeak, squeakerton.

2067
02:04:46,910 --> 02:04:47,350
Oh no?

2068
02:04:47,610 --> 02:04:47,810
No.

2069
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:50,890
Where do I go then?

2070
02:04:51,710 --> 02:04:52,390
Did I miss something?

2071
02:04:53,030 --> 02:04:56,110
I mean, surely I did, but...

2072
02:04:56,950 --> 02:04:59,170
Surely I did, but...

2073
02:05:08,650 --> 02:05:10,530
Is this a little hole?

2074
02:05:11,290 --> 02:05:12,490
No, that's a grave.

2075
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:17,500
Let me try going back through here.

2076
02:05:21,700 --> 02:05:23,620
There's something I missed, guys.

2077
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:25,860
There's something I missed.

2078
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:30,040
Miss, miss, miss.

2079
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:31,500
Miss.

2080
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:32,980
Miss.

2081
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:34,720
Miss.

2082
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:35,360
Maybe...

2083
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,940
I used the ledge.

2084
02:05:37,820 --> 02:05:39,460
No, the ledge stops.

2085
02:05:41,680 --> 02:05:45,340
If I can use my whip, it will tell me, you know?

2086
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:50,740
Made miss.

2087
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:53,880
Yeah.

2088
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:55,700
Let's see.

2089
02:05:57,920 --> 02:05:58,560
Three.

2090
02:06:03,540 --> 02:06:04,640
Wow, just in!

2091
02:06:05,180 --> 02:06:08,240
I just want to say that I flew down from DC to see the concert.

2092
02:06:08,420 --> 02:06:09,420
We had an absolute blast.

2093
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:09,920
Thank you.

2094
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,800
I hope it was worth it.

2095
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:12,740
Oh, there it is.

2096
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:14,720
Thank you.

2097
02:06:25,620 --> 02:06:27,100
My torch did not...

2098
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:28,800
No!

2099
02:06:33,700 --> 02:06:35,560
I needed to burn this down.

2100
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:39,020
You can throw it across?

2101
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:40,540
Oh, I did not know that.

2102
02:06:40,540 --> 02:06:41,680
Okay, let's go get it.

2103
02:06:44,360 --> 02:06:49,580
Oh my god, this place looks super mega spooky when there's no torch.

2104
02:06:58,010 --> 02:06:59,850
I just throw it?

2105
02:07:11,780 --> 02:07:13,180
Turn...

2106
02:07:26,440 --> 02:07:27,580
My bad.

2107
02:07:33,940 --> 02:07:35,460
Little more oomph.

2108
02:07:37,260 --> 02:07:38,400
It's like...

2109
02:07:50,110 --> 02:07:50,790
Nice.

2110
02:07:51,370 --> 02:07:52,390
We did it.

2111
02:07:54,390 --> 02:07:55,070
Fire.

2112
02:07:56,030 --> 02:07:57,930
Why did they lock those up, I wonder?

2113
02:07:58,270 --> 02:07:59,370
That makes me nervous.

2114
02:08:01,030 --> 02:08:02,730
Why are some of these...

2115
02:08:03,990 --> 02:08:05,110
Oh my goodness.

2116
02:08:10,400 --> 02:08:12,440
This, I think...

2117
02:08:13,860 --> 02:08:18,660
Is a quarter couple.

2118
02:08:21,020 --> 02:08:21,520
Four!

2119
02:08:21,860 --> 02:08:22,760
Is this the tomb?

2120
02:08:24,340 --> 02:08:25,780
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

2121
02:08:26,340 --> 02:08:28,900
Hold on, there's a little bit more to explore.

2122
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:33,340
A corporal.

2123
02:08:37,320 --> 02:08:38,320
Secret found.

2124
02:08:45,210 --> 02:08:46,050
This is it.

2125
02:08:46,210 --> 02:08:47,290
Tomb fresco.

2126
02:08:56,130 --> 02:08:56,910
Wow.

2127
02:08:57,550 --> 02:08:58,970
Oh yeah, look.

2128
02:09:01,910 --> 02:09:04,550
It's a...

2129
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:07,430
Oh gosh, medieval art.

2130
02:09:09,490 --> 02:09:10,830
Just like those cats.

2131
02:09:10,870 --> 02:09:12,130
That's a...

2132
02:09:13,170 --> 02:09:14,110
Pig?

2133
02:09:16,690 --> 02:09:19,130
That's a man fighting a...

2134
02:09:20,350 --> 02:09:20,890
Dog?

2135
02:09:20,890 --> 02:09:21,250
Dog?

2136
02:09:25,590 --> 02:09:26,250
Lizard?

2137
02:09:28,580 --> 02:09:31,150
Alright guys, let's go into the big baddie room.

2138
02:09:32,870 --> 02:09:35,090
Where we might have to fight...

2139
02:09:35,090 --> 02:09:36,990
These bones look...

2140
02:09:36,990 --> 02:09:38,290
Of average size, right?

2141
02:09:40,750 --> 02:09:43,310
This rib cage is just sticking up.

2142
02:09:43,310 --> 02:09:52,050
What is this?

2143
02:09:53,050 --> 02:09:53,730
Refrigerator.

2144
02:09:55,710 --> 02:09:56,970
Alright, here we go.

2145
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:05,220
My hat.

2146
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:08,980
Oh, I put my clothes back on.

2147
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:11,360
I'm not a priest anymore.

2148
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:14,400
I'm an adventurer.

2149
02:10:23,580 --> 02:10:23,940
Oh...

2150
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:27,960
They were like, we don't want you being a priest for the cutscenes.

2151
02:10:39,340 --> 02:10:40,520
That's kind of nice though.

2152
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:43,120
But what if I want to look...

2153
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:45,940
Wait, Indy, what outfit are you wearing?

2154
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:47,200
What are you wearing?

2155
02:10:52,130 --> 02:10:53,270
That's the right one, right?

2156
02:10:59,750 --> 02:11:00,150
Wait...

2157
02:11:01,910 --> 02:11:02,990
I need this.

2158
02:11:06,910 --> 02:11:07,930
Can I light this?

2159
02:11:08,810 --> 02:11:08,990
No?

2160
02:11:14,710 --> 02:11:16,250
Oh, I can light this.

2161
02:11:16,670 --> 02:11:17,070
Nice.

2162
02:11:19,530 --> 02:11:20,830
Oh, see, these are so scary.

2163
02:11:21,730 --> 02:11:22,590
Why do you look like that?

2164
02:11:23,110 --> 02:11:24,410
Even he is scared of it.

2165
02:11:25,910 --> 02:11:26,910
I'm next to that...

2166
02:11:27,470 --> 02:11:28,370
Freaky lady.

2167
02:11:31,190 --> 02:11:32,110
Face palm.

2168
02:11:37,380 --> 02:11:38,820
Okay, you guys made it silly.

2169
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:41,840
This guy is hiding something.

2170
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:42,960
Look, he is smiling.

2171
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:46,740
He is like...

2172
02:11:48,640 --> 02:11:50,220
Oh wow, a knight.

2173
02:11:50,660 --> 02:11:53,260
Oh my gosh, he looks like the Praise the Sun guy.

2174
02:11:59,260 --> 02:12:00,740
Hiding his arm.

2175
02:12:01,040 --> 02:12:03,360
And his arm is actually an axe.

2176
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:09,120
Why is that light on?

2177
02:12:12,280 --> 02:12:15,240
His arm is actually made of spiders.

2178
02:12:18,780 --> 02:12:20,340
Praise the Sun.

2179
02:12:26,280 --> 02:12:28,100
There is so much around here.

2180
02:12:34,860 --> 02:12:36,120
See, that's freaky.

2181
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:37,540
Rain of spiders.

2182
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:41,980
When do dark souls win?

2183
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:43,480
I don't know.

2184
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:47,180
I'm gonna try Bloodborne and see if I even like souls like Gims.

2185
02:12:49,140 --> 02:12:56,700
You know, I don't think I... I have to be super duper mentally prepared for the verbal abuse I'll get from chat.

2186
02:12:59,020 --> 02:13:04,080
I have to be prepared, I have to be mentally... I have to stable my mental fortitude.

2187
02:13:14,700 --> 02:13:15,740
We'll see though.

2188
02:13:16,580 --> 02:13:17,420
We'll see.

2189
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:21,400
When... I mean like, Bloodborne is gonna be the same way.

2190
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:22,120
But you know.

2191
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:31,880
Chat, translate.

2192
02:13:36,730 --> 02:13:37,910
You can do it, Minky.

2193
02:13:37,910 --> 02:13:38,710
Thanks!

2194
02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:46,960
Okay, we're definitely gonna have to do something with these guys.

2195
02:13:47,740 --> 02:13:48,220
Eventually.

2196
02:13:48,380 --> 02:13:48,880
Alright, let's go.

2197
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:50,520
Sorry, I was exploring.

2198
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:53,960
Okay, let's go to the main event.

2199
02:13:56,500 --> 02:14:01,160
Elden Ring or DS3 are the easiest for an introductory game.

2200
02:14:02,500 --> 02:14:03,440
No Elp.

2201
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:05,240
I didn't ask for your Elp.

2202
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:08,240
I didn't ask for your Elp.

2203
02:14:08,240 --> 02:14:08,820
Oh.

2204
02:14:12,580 --> 02:14:14,480
Tomb of the Warrior Giant.

2205
02:14:14,840 --> 02:14:15,720
Oh, 4 star!

2206
02:14:29,540 --> 02:14:35,020
I'm getting now why every game you play becomes a horror game, because it will always have a ghost in it.

2207
02:14:37,280 --> 02:14:40,020
You put a little boogie in it.

2208
02:14:42,790 --> 02:14:43,490
You get it?

2209
02:14:43,590 --> 02:14:44,030
You get it?

2210
02:14:47,190 --> 02:14:48,430
No Elp.

2211
02:14:48,730 --> 02:14:49,770
I don't want your Elp.

2212
02:14:51,150 --> 02:14:52,790
How's the game's quality been so far?

2213
02:14:53,330 --> 02:14:54,290
Game is fine.

2214
02:14:56,150 --> 02:14:57,330
Game is fine.

2215
02:14:59,150 --> 02:15:00,350
Where's the cross?

2216
02:15:01,590 --> 02:15:02,450
This one?

2217
02:15:07,350 --> 02:15:09,810
I don't know if you... Oh, Indy.

2218
02:15:14,550 --> 02:15:15,890
What do you mean it didn't work?

2219
02:15:22,670 --> 02:15:23,650
Crusader Shield.

2220
02:15:24,950 --> 02:15:25,470
Okay.

2221
02:15:26,550 --> 02:15:26,810
I know.

2222
02:15:27,050 --> 02:15:28,370
Silent Hill 2 moment.

2223
02:15:28,430 --> 02:15:29,910
I was thinking the same exact thing.

2224
02:15:31,250 --> 02:15:33,510
Of like when...

2225
02:15:33,510 --> 02:15:35,530
When he puts his hand in the toilet.

2226
02:15:39,250 --> 02:15:40,670
With the shield.

2227
02:15:46,920 --> 02:15:48,440
Put this here.

2228
02:15:49,120 --> 02:15:49,380
Nope.

2229
02:15:49,620 --> 02:15:50,080
Just kidding.

2230
02:15:54,140 --> 02:15:55,400
Why do I have this?

2231
02:15:59,220 --> 02:16:02,780
The one thing that's so funny about items in this game is they never look heavy.

2232
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:03,760
You know what I mean?

2233
02:16:05,620 --> 02:16:06,400
Sorry.

2234
02:16:06,740 --> 02:16:07,600
That scared me.

2235
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:13,760
They never...or rather they never sound heavy when you drop them.

2236
02:16:22,040 --> 02:16:23,340
Indy, your hand.

2237
02:16:25,120 --> 02:16:25,640
Oh no.

2238
02:16:27,820 --> 02:16:28,600
Indy!

2239
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:30,940
Indy?

2240
02:16:31,740 --> 02:16:32,300
Indy?

2241
02:16:33,660 --> 02:16:34,440
Indy?

2242
02:16:40,260 --> 02:16:41,040
Indy!

2243
02:16:53,720 --> 02:16:55,640
It's a big old boulder!

2244
02:17:00,770 --> 02:17:01,990
Oh RIP.

2245
02:17:02,530 --> 02:17:04,010
I guess that's one way to open it.

2246
02:17:06,370 --> 02:17:07,710
No way!

2247
02:17:08,170 --> 02:17:09,410
The barns!

2248
02:17:10,110 --> 02:17:10,990
No, Indy!

2249
02:17:11,070 --> 02:17:12,370
You destroyed it!

2250
02:17:12,410 --> 02:17:14,370
You are the worst archeologist ever!

2251
02:17:17,650 --> 02:17:18,330
No!

2252
02:17:19,790 --> 02:17:21,350
The barns!

2253
02:17:29,510 --> 02:17:32,710
What did you think giant...what did you think giant referred to, Indy?

2254
02:17:37,510 --> 02:17:38,210
What is that?

2255
02:17:38,790 --> 02:17:40,090
He doesn't care about the bones?

2256
02:17:40,890 --> 02:17:42,530
I feel like the bones are a cool part.

2257
02:17:48,370 --> 02:17:49,830
Fountain of Confession.

2258
02:17:52,030 --> 02:17:56,250
Entrance to the sacred monastery of the Nephilim Order.

2259
02:17:56,630 --> 02:18:00,030
This is when the baddies come in and are just like you found it for us.

2260
02:18:00,170 --> 02:18:02,530
I wanted this for my cat mummy.

2261
02:18:12,810 --> 02:18:14,050
Excuse me?

2262
02:18:17,490 --> 02:18:18,110
What?

2263
02:18:31,290 --> 02:18:31,850
What?

2264
02:18:33,810 --> 02:18:34,850
No way.

2265
02:18:35,230 --> 02:18:37,070
The guy was just bulldozing through the whole thing.

2266
02:18:37,370 --> 02:18:37,630
What?

2267
02:18:38,030 --> 02:18:38,430
Oh no.

2268
02:18:39,170 --> 02:18:39,750
Indy move!

2269
02:18:45,590 --> 02:18:47,850
I don't think that's how bulldozers work.

2270
02:18:54,950 --> 02:18:56,130
Indy get your hat.

2271
02:19:04,180 --> 02:19:05,940
We got a trusty whip.

2272
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:07,440
Trusty hat.

2273
02:19:11,440 --> 02:19:12,220
And...

2274
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:23,000
I think you can push this.

2275
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:26,880
I think you can push through that.

2276
02:19:27,260 --> 02:19:27,660
Whatever.

2277
02:19:29,220 --> 02:19:30,180
Map unlocked.

2278
02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:31,520
Necropolis.

2279
02:19:32,320 --> 02:19:32,480
What?

2280
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:34,940
No I don't have my...

2281
02:19:37,500 --> 02:19:39,440
I don't have my torch.

2282
02:19:41,400 --> 02:19:42,880
Welcome to Vapusha.

2283
02:19:42,980 --> 02:19:43,400
Thank you.

2284
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:45,140
8 months mogu's minted.

2285
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:47,020
Thank you.

2286
02:19:52,130 --> 02:19:52,670
Necropolis.

2287
02:19:56,110 --> 02:19:57,790
Imagine it's like a weeping angel.

2288
02:19:57,910 --> 02:19:59,210
We turn the corner and he's gone.

2289
02:19:59,550 --> 02:20:00,170
I might...

2290
02:20:00,170 --> 02:20:02,590
I was gonna say I might poop my pants.

2291
02:20:03,570 --> 02:20:04,810
Luckily I didn't say that.

2292
02:20:05,130 --> 02:20:05,930
And it didn't happen.

2293
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:13,020
Anyway.

2294
02:20:13,620 --> 02:20:15,600
I wish I had a torch right now.

2295
02:20:25,030 --> 02:20:26,450
Like zoinks goop.

2296
02:20:26,450 --> 02:20:28,470
I don't wanna fall in there.

2297
02:20:34,840 --> 02:20:36,060
Like zoinks goop.

2298
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:38,920
This looks even worse cause it's really dark and it's also a dead end.

2299
02:20:43,100 --> 02:20:44,140
What then?

2300
02:20:45,260 --> 02:20:47,080
That was a bad shaggy.

2301
02:20:47,220 --> 02:20:48,540
You're a bad shaggy.

2302
02:20:54,690 --> 02:20:55,730
Uh.

2303
02:20:58,870 --> 02:21:00,630
I'm not even shaggy.

2304
02:21:00,710 --> 02:21:01,130
I'm minky.

2305
02:21:05,290 --> 02:21:10,010
I can't believe this female trying to impersonate.

2306
02:21:11,550 --> 02:21:14,170
The well known character of shaggy.

2307
02:21:14,730 --> 02:21:16,610
From beloved series.

2308
02:21:18,230 --> 02:21:19,170
Scooby Doo.

2309
02:21:19,870 --> 02:21:24,030
How dare she does a terrible impression of that man.

2310
02:21:25,910 --> 02:21:26,350
Okay.

2311
02:21:26,590 --> 02:21:28,330
I think we're just gonna have to drop down baby.

2312
02:21:28,890 --> 02:21:29,450
Let's go.

2313
02:21:32,710 --> 02:21:35,850
Thank you for one of the most life affirming concerts of my life.

2314
02:21:35,930 --> 02:21:36,930
What do you mean by that?

2315
02:21:37,090 --> 02:21:45,110
It reignited a passion in me to learn more mixes and why I hope you realize you healed a lot of hearts by convincing Tokyo to sing last cup of coffee.

2316
02:21:46,470 --> 02:21:47,730
Thank you!

2317
02:21:52,150 --> 02:21:54,110
Keep doing shaggy.

2318
02:21:54,570 --> 02:21:55,250
I beg.

2319
02:21:56,030 --> 02:21:56,730
Here we go.

2320
02:21:56,850 --> 02:21:58,010
Wait, maybe I do.

2321
02:22:14,790 --> 02:22:16,310
Oh no!

2322
02:22:20,250 --> 02:22:21,550
There's only one way.

2323
02:22:26,870 --> 02:22:27,750
Okay.

2324
02:22:28,330 --> 02:22:33,730
We're swimming through this nasty, nasty, nasty water filled with ancient bones.

2325
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:35,370
No biggie.

2326
02:22:37,410 --> 02:22:38,710
No biggie.

2327
02:22:39,450 --> 02:22:39,830
Okay.

2328
02:22:39,830 --> 02:22:39,950
Okay.

2329
02:22:41,930 --> 02:22:44,710
I don't know if this... Would this count as still water?

2330
02:22:45,790 --> 02:22:50,210
Like it looks like water comes in through up here, you know?

2331
02:22:50,350 --> 02:22:51,910
Otherwise there would be no sunlight.

2332
02:22:54,290 --> 02:22:55,870
Oh no, still water.

2333
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:03,080
And up.

2334
02:23:06,670 --> 02:23:08,490
I mean I'm not saying I would drink it.

2335
02:23:08,870 --> 02:23:11,210
I'm just saying...

2336
02:23:11,710 --> 02:23:12,990
I don't... I'm looking.

2337
02:23:12,990 --> 02:23:18,540
There's not even fish in here.

2338
02:23:19,240 --> 02:23:21,820
I sure wish I had my torch.

2339
02:23:24,980 --> 02:23:27,140
Yeah, we are.

2340
02:23:31,820 --> 02:23:32,740
Camera.

2341
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:34,040
Here?

2342
02:23:37,180 --> 02:23:38,100
There.

2343
02:23:38,100 --> 02:23:39,020
Oceanus.

2344
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:44,400
That's sick.

2345
02:23:44,740 --> 02:23:45,960
That's a really cool picture.

2346
02:23:48,320 --> 02:23:49,220
I'll do 50.

2347
02:23:49,340 --> 02:23:50,060
No, we'll do 70.

2348
02:23:58,440 --> 02:24:00,160
Yeah, there's other people there.

2349
02:24:00,260 --> 02:24:01,820
Oh, I'm so sorry!

2350
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:05,780
Oh, there are other guys.

2351
02:24:06,640 --> 02:24:07,600
Oh, my bad.

2352
02:24:09,900 --> 02:24:11,400
Yeah, 80 points for that.

2353
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:12,060
I know, right?

2354
02:24:12,180 --> 02:24:12,460
Crazy.

2355
02:24:13,180 --> 02:24:13,800
Let's go.

2356
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:17,580
Where's the exit, he says.

2357
02:24:20,660 --> 02:24:22,120
Just like the little ghosts.

2358
02:24:22,300 --> 02:24:25,420
I mean the skellies that are just kind of chilling around.

2359
02:24:27,060 --> 02:24:30,380
I feel like this is... Seems close to the surface.

2360
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:33,620
With how the light is shining through.

2361
02:24:33,720 --> 02:24:35,420
How has nobody discovered this yet?

2362
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:42,880
Yeah.

2363
02:24:46,670 --> 02:24:48,990
Don Liz, welcome to Mambo Ship.

2364
02:24:49,110 --> 02:24:49,970
Thank you!

2365
02:24:53,190 --> 02:24:55,510
Ancient anime figurines.

2366
02:24:56,490 --> 02:24:57,490
Alright, through here.

2367
02:24:59,250 --> 02:24:59,690
That was scary.

2368
02:25:00,930 --> 02:25:01,990
Yeah, maybe.

2369
02:25:02,290 --> 02:25:02,670
Hopefully.

2370
02:25:04,730 --> 02:25:05,410
Noseless.

2371
02:25:06,310 --> 02:25:07,150
Couldn't be me.

2372
02:25:13,390 --> 02:25:14,930
Oh, they have found it.

2373
02:25:18,450 --> 02:25:19,490
A ghost.

2374
02:25:22,910 --> 02:25:24,070
This isn't...

2375
02:25:27,310 --> 02:25:29,770
Oops, I meant to do this and then this.

2376
02:25:30,430 --> 02:25:31,850
This isn't a restricted area.

2377
02:25:40,220 --> 02:25:40,800
Yeah,

2378
02:25:44,300 --> 02:25:45,060
I'm fine.

2379
02:25:45,360 --> 02:25:46,540
I'm just a guy.

2380
02:25:47,620 --> 02:25:49,220
Oh, maybe I'm not supposed to be here.

2381
02:25:56,170 --> 02:25:58,370
Maybe I'm not supposed to be here.

2382
02:25:58,830 --> 02:26:00,370
Is there any weapons?

2383
02:26:01,130 --> 02:26:01,990
Anything about?

2384
02:26:02,950 --> 02:26:04,170
Oh, she'll...

2385
02:26:10,470 --> 02:26:11,170
Yeah.

2386
02:26:12,910 --> 02:26:13,930
Square up.

2387
02:26:16,390 --> 02:26:18,170
He's gonna notice his friend down.

2388
02:26:19,610 --> 02:26:20,930
And then I'm gonna bonk him.

2389
02:26:28,320 --> 02:26:29,200
Yeah, dummy!

2390
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:33,400
Oh, I can get my own helmet?

2391
02:26:34,280 --> 02:26:35,540
Wait, how do I grab this?

2392
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:35,820
Wait.

2393
02:26:37,620 --> 02:26:38,100
Bandage.

2394
02:26:41,360 --> 02:26:42,700
Oh, I get it.

2395
02:26:42,780 --> 02:26:43,060
I get it.

2396
02:26:43,520 --> 02:26:44,120
He's a medic.

2397
02:26:45,700 --> 02:26:47,140
And a torch!

2398
02:26:49,540 --> 02:26:52,000
Why wouldn't a priest be able to be down here?

2399
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:53,220
What's wrong with that?

2400
02:26:54,960 --> 02:26:55,920
I'm just...

2401
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:57,480
I don't know.

2402
02:26:57,820 --> 02:26:59,120
I'm doing my duties.

2403
02:27:00,120 --> 02:27:01,120
He's a holy man.

2404
02:27:06,360 --> 02:27:08,980
Yeah, for some reason it was still considered a part of his body.

2405
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:11,400
The helmet.

2406
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:13,620
Okay.

2407
02:27:14,420 --> 02:27:14,940
Onwards.

2408
02:27:15,720 --> 02:27:20,860
I fear that I might explore too much sometimes, but...

2409
02:27:20,860 --> 02:27:22,780
I don't wanna miss out on...

2410
02:27:22,780 --> 02:27:24,100
No, not yet, Indy!

2411
02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:28,500
I don't wanna miss out on stuff.

2412
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:32,720
What was that?

2413
02:27:33,580 --> 02:27:35,240
Okay, that's just a loopy loop.

2414
02:27:35,960 --> 02:27:38,300
It's like there was that one room...

2415
02:27:38,840 --> 02:27:41,520
There was a thing hidden behind...

2416
02:27:42,040 --> 02:27:44,300
There was one room we missed a note in.

2417
02:27:45,460 --> 02:27:46,220
It's frustrating.

2418
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:48,220
You think our thing is gonna go out?

2419
02:27:48,540 --> 02:27:48,720
Yep.

2420
02:27:55,560 --> 02:27:56,180
Whoa.

2421
02:28:02,410 --> 02:28:03,570
Stop, Indy!

2422
02:28:03,670 --> 02:28:04,990
You're embarrassing me!

2423
02:28:05,850 --> 02:28:06,770
Okay, hold on.

2424
02:28:06,810 --> 02:28:07,210
Let's see.

2425
02:28:11,030 --> 02:28:12,370
Another baby puzzle.

2426
02:28:15,530 --> 02:28:16,150
Light?

2427
02:28:18,070 --> 02:28:19,430
Can I put this away?

2428
02:28:22,750 --> 02:28:24,470
Can I throw it through the hole?

2429
02:28:29,030 --> 02:28:29,390
Close.

2430
02:28:30,270 --> 02:28:30,630
Throw.

2431
02:28:34,360 --> 02:28:34,720
Throw.

2432
02:28:39,080 --> 02:28:39,440
Scooch.

2433
02:28:40,300 --> 02:28:40,660
Throw.

2434
02:28:43,780 --> 02:28:44,140
Damn.

2435
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:45,060
Oh, wait!

2436
02:28:48,380 --> 02:28:49,960
Indy, I need you to get that back for me!

2437
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:53,080
Indy!

2438
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:56,100
Indy, I need you to get that back for

2439
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:15,000
me!

2440
02:29:15,480 --> 02:29:16,500
Where did the other one go?

2441
02:29:16,500 --> 02:29:16,560
Oh.

2442
02:29:22,440 --> 02:29:23,640
There's gonna be more guys.

2443
02:29:26,620 --> 02:29:26,980
Surely.

2444
02:29:36,280 --> 02:29:37,880
Guys, why didn't you stop me?

2445
02:29:38,620 --> 02:29:40,080
Why didn't you say...

2446
02:29:40,500 --> 02:29:44,340
Minto, I think it will go out and you won't be able to get it back if you throw it in there.

2447
02:29:44,700 --> 02:29:45,980
Why didn't you stop me?

2448
02:29:45,980 --> 02:29:46,040
Indy!

2449
02:29:52,340 --> 02:29:54,160
Oh, please feed me.

2450
02:29:54,280 --> 02:29:56,480
I'm just a little hungry squirrel, madam.

2451
02:29:57,220 --> 02:29:58,980
May I please have a grape?

2452
02:29:59,580 --> 02:30:00,420
Oh, please.

2453
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:02,540
May I please have a grape?

2454
02:30:11,530 --> 02:30:12,570
No help.

2455
02:30:15,630 --> 02:30:17,530
Is this where I needed to throw it?

2456
02:30:27,640 --> 02:30:29,080
There's gonna be more guys.

2457
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:30,080
This is me.

2458
02:30:30,320 --> 02:30:31,720
That's me after I threw...

2459
02:30:33,680 --> 02:30:35,780
That's me after I threw the damn thing.

2460
02:30:46,300 --> 02:30:47,200
Reload save.

2461
02:30:47,320 --> 02:30:48,540
Where was my last checkpoint?

2462
02:30:54,160 --> 02:30:55,420
Five minutes ago.

2463
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:05,600
We just gotta knock these guys out again.

2464
02:31:06,440 --> 02:31:07,280
Easy peasy.

2465
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:11,580
Ok, we got this.

2466
02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:15,500
We got this.

2467
02:31:15,560 --> 02:31:16,080
We got this.

2468
02:31:17,260 --> 02:31:18,060
Literally through.

2469
02:31:20,680 --> 02:31:23,540
I know I wasn't softlocked, but I still wanted to get that part.

2470
02:31:24,360 --> 02:31:25,000
It's all good.

2471
02:31:29,020 --> 02:31:30,920
We wait for them to come over here.

2472
02:31:50,380 --> 02:31:52,340
In a thousand years, maybe I'll be worth something.

2473
02:31:52,440 --> 02:31:54,560
They clearly don't care about skellies.

2474
02:31:55,480 --> 02:31:56,400
You see this?

2475
02:31:57,400 --> 02:32:00,100
Indiana Jones sees a skeleton and he's just like, I don't care.

2476
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:10,160
Poor thing.

2477
02:32:10,840 --> 02:32:11,800
Felt like a leaf.

2478
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:14,420
Time to go after your friend.

2479
02:32:16,540 --> 02:32:18,460
This shadow is so ominous.

2480
02:32:21,080 --> 02:32:22,000
Where's your friend at?

2481
02:32:24,860 --> 02:32:25,840
Oh here he comes.

2482
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:26,860
I see the light.

2483
02:32:27,580 --> 02:32:28,240
I see the light.

2484
02:32:28,320 --> 02:32:28,960
It's coming closer.

2485
02:32:29,780 --> 02:32:30,540
It's coming closer.

2486
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:32,860
Yeah, you're bored huh?

2487
02:32:33,040 --> 02:32:34,320
I'll liven things up for you.

2488
02:32:34,860 --> 02:32:36,540
With a little...

2489
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:42,360
Hey, where are you?

2490
02:32:47,800 --> 02:32:49,200
Hey, stop blocking.

2491
02:32:50,140 --> 02:32:51,900
Wait, you went down so easily before.

2492
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:52,580
What happened?

2493
02:32:52,580 --> 02:32:52,620
What happened?

2494
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:00,500
We ragdolled him.

2495
02:33:02,680 --> 02:33:04,160
Nice, another medic.

2496
02:33:05,140 --> 02:33:05,940
So true.

2497
02:33:07,160 --> 02:33:08,680
Hey, give me your bandage.

2498
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:09,520
Thank you.

2499
02:33:12,100 --> 02:33:14,240
Anyway, good day fellas.

2500
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:19,180
And then we have now also the second one.

2501
02:33:21,880 --> 02:33:25,560
Because I lost the other one since I used it in combat.

2502
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:29,580
Okay, here I imagine.

2503
02:33:30,180 --> 02:33:31,120
That's where I throw it, right?

2504
02:33:32,320 --> 02:33:32,560
Throw!

2505
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:50,000
War crimes!

2506
02:33:51,880 --> 02:33:52,360
Oh,

2507
02:33:56,120 --> 02:33:57,400
I guess I can also...

2508
02:34:02,480 --> 02:34:04,440
I guess I can also...

2509
02:34:07,240 --> 02:34:08,760
Maybe I was soft locked.

2510
02:34:10,160 --> 02:34:11,200
Ancient relic.

2511
02:34:12,380 --> 02:34:15,600
Curious hand carved stone object of prehistoric origin.

2512
02:34:15,860 --> 02:34:19,540
This looks like literally everything else we've seen in this entire place.

2513
02:34:21,860 --> 02:34:24,800
I was going to say, I guess we can just throw it back through the hole.

2514
02:34:25,820 --> 02:34:26,480
But whatever.

2515
02:34:44,500 --> 02:34:45,900
Yeah, baby.

2516
02:34:46,220 --> 02:34:46,980
Yeah, baby.

2517
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:47,700
Yeah, baby.

2518
02:34:51,100 --> 02:34:55,100
Nothing to swing across, so I guess we go down.

2519
02:35:07,170 --> 02:35:08,290
Oh, there's two of them.

2520
02:35:09,350 --> 02:35:10,470
There's two guys.

2521
02:35:12,890 --> 02:35:14,010
Three guys.

2522
02:35:16,470 --> 02:35:17,430
Four guys.

2523
02:35:17,710 --> 02:35:19,070
Why do they keep multiplying?

2524
02:35:22,600 --> 02:35:27,620
You can pretty much return almost anywhere you want after a mission, so no stress about missing stuff permanently.

2525
02:35:27,740 --> 02:35:28,200
Oh, really?

2526
02:35:28,840 --> 02:35:29,620
Thank you, Jesse.

2527
02:35:37,750 --> 02:35:38,450
Bless you.

2528
02:35:55,310 --> 02:35:56,310
Someone heard.

2529
02:35:56,530 --> 02:35:57,270
Someone is seeing.

2530
02:35:57,490 --> 02:35:58,270
Someone is perceiving.

2531
02:35:59,190 --> 02:36:01,170
No one perceives.

2532
02:36:01,810 --> 02:36:03,090
No one sees.

2533
02:36:03,370 --> 02:36:04,070
Drop this guy.

2534
02:36:04,490 --> 02:36:04,810
I don't care.

2535
02:36:05,590 --> 02:36:06,730
Pick up my weapon.

2536
02:36:07,250 --> 02:36:16,990
Oh gosh, this place is crawling.

2537
02:36:22,230 --> 02:36:23,510
Oh, there's another guy.

2538
02:36:23,610 --> 02:36:24,170
Oh my gosh.

2539
02:36:25,390 --> 02:36:27,190
It's like seven guys.

2540
02:36:27,810 --> 02:36:29,570
We need to open a new restaurant.

2541
02:36:34,020 --> 02:36:35,340
What if I threw this?

2542
02:36:36,240 --> 02:36:36,920
No.

2543
02:36:37,100 --> 02:36:37,980
Oh, it's a double handed.

2544
02:36:38,820 --> 02:36:39,660
Oh, there they are.

2545
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:43,920
Just gonna do what I did before.

2546
02:36:51,340 --> 02:36:53,140
Oh, he's still alive.

2547
02:36:54,100 --> 02:36:55,940
How are you still awake?

2548
02:36:58,000 --> 02:36:59,360
Fascist whistling.

2549
02:37:04,470 --> 02:37:07,050
Yeah, we're not listening.

2550
02:37:07,050 --> 02:37:07,310
Oh.

2551
02:37:09,490 --> 02:37:11,730
Guy does not care at all.

2552
02:37:14,870 --> 02:37:16,590
I didn't even take damage.

2553
02:37:16,910 --> 02:37:17,710
Oh, I have another bat.

2554
02:37:19,630 --> 02:37:20,270
Wait, who?

2555
02:37:20,970 --> 02:37:21,570
Who noticed?

2556
02:37:23,810 --> 02:37:25,410
Oh, there's two guys up there.

2557
02:37:27,050 --> 02:37:29,110
I love not needing stealth.

2558
02:37:32,130 --> 02:37:33,650
I'm just going through.

2559
02:37:33,790 --> 02:37:34,270
Oh, wait.

2560
02:37:34,270 --> 02:37:36,550
Why are you...what?

2561
02:37:37,730 --> 02:37:39,310
Why are you over there?

2562
02:37:45,570 --> 02:37:47,010
What are you doing here?

2563
02:37:48,770 --> 02:37:49,830
Little whistle man.

2564
02:37:50,710 --> 02:37:53,810
That was weird, huh?

2565
02:37:59,410 --> 02:38:00,130
Peaceful.

2566
02:38:04,430 --> 02:38:05,910
I'm just exploring.

2567
02:38:07,090 --> 02:38:08,110
I love my fists.

2568
02:38:08,630 --> 02:38:10,310
I love having fists.

2569
02:38:11,090 --> 02:38:11,790
Oh, shit.

2570
02:38:12,730 --> 02:38:15,410
This guy's got a bat.

2571
02:38:15,690 --> 02:38:16,650
Anybody else over here?

2572
02:38:17,150 --> 02:38:18,150
No, I don't see any.

2573
02:38:20,630 --> 02:38:25,850
Yeah, I guess there were some other guys.

2574
02:38:31,170 --> 02:38:32,470
I can take them.

2575
02:38:36,270 --> 02:38:37,230
Three guys?

2576
02:38:37,290 --> 02:38:37,970
I can't take them.

2577
02:38:40,150 --> 02:38:43,310
They keep multiplying.

2578
02:38:46,170 --> 02:38:48,930
Isn't there supposed to be a guy that like wanders around up here?

2579
02:38:49,970 --> 02:38:50,610
Oh, wait.

2580
02:38:50,670 --> 02:38:52,450
This thing has like crazy...

2581
02:38:52,450 --> 02:38:55,290
You can't see, but it's like...

2582
02:38:55,290 --> 02:38:57,090
It's got a lot of...

2583
02:38:59,830 --> 02:39:01,250
Oh, who noticed?

2584
02:39:02,950 --> 02:39:04,030
Did they wake him up?

2585
02:39:08,350 --> 02:39:09,390
Okay, I'll go down.

2586
02:39:10,030 --> 02:39:11,430
Yeah, a lot of durability.

2587
02:39:22,770 --> 02:39:23,310
Bye!

2588
02:39:36,370 --> 02:39:37,450
Found you!

2589
02:39:38,510 --> 02:39:39,950
Wait, this is actually bad.

2590
02:39:40,330 --> 02:39:41,090
This is actually bad.

2591
02:39:47,010 --> 02:39:47,490
Shit.

2592
02:39:48,550 --> 02:39:49,610
This might be bad.

2593
02:39:55,130 --> 02:39:56,270
Okay, we got him.

2594
02:39:56,390 --> 02:39:56,770
We got him.

2595
02:39:57,990 --> 02:39:58,930
Another man down.

2596
02:39:59,750 --> 02:39:59,970
No!

2597
02:40:00,190 --> 02:40:00,610
No!

2598
02:40:00,870 --> 02:40:01,190
No!

2599
02:40:01,310 --> 02:40:02,010
Don't you dare!

2600
02:40:02,310 --> 02:40:02,870
Don't you dare!

2601
02:40:04,970 --> 02:40:05,910
That's my line.

2602
02:40:07,010 --> 02:40:07,870
Yeah, take him down.

2603
02:40:09,310 --> 02:40:10,350
He's healing them.

2604
02:40:10,450 --> 02:40:11,790
Yeah, he heals them.

2605
02:40:11,830 --> 02:40:12,370
That's crazy.

2606
02:40:14,190 --> 02:40:14,750
Oh, wait.

2607
02:40:14,890 --> 02:40:15,830
Are they back up then?

2608
02:40:15,830 --> 02:40:16,570
Oh no.

2609
02:40:17,210 --> 02:40:18,550
That's so messed up!

2610
02:40:19,290 --> 02:40:21,430
We got the medic at least.

2611
02:40:21,830 --> 02:40:22,870
Hopefully there's not another one.

2612
02:40:23,150 --> 02:40:24,570
Look at all these guys!

2613
02:40:26,590 --> 02:40:28,190
There's so many guys!

2614
02:40:29,070 --> 02:40:29,790
Take their butt.

2615
02:40:31,090 --> 02:40:31,610
Skella!

2616
02:40:32,970 --> 02:40:34,350
Your venue is great.

2617
02:40:34,430 --> 02:40:35,290
Music is amazing.

2618
02:40:35,570 --> 02:40:38,170
And you even knew about the aquarium instead of just the airport.

2619
02:40:39,010 --> 02:40:39,710
Wait, what do you mean?

2620
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:51,580
You did your best, champ.

2621
02:40:54,220 --> 02:40:55,480
You're so condescending.

2622
02:40:57,440 --> 02:40:58,660
But thank you!

2623
02:40:59,820 --> 02:41:01,340
I'm glad you liked it.

2624
02:41:09,290 --> 02:41:10,130
Nice!

2625
02:41:12,670 --> 02:41:14,690
The big durability baby.

2626
02:41:15,990 --> 02:41:18,670
I think this land is ours now.

2627
02:41:19,890 --> 02:41:21,750
I've claimed it.

2628
02:41:22,410 --> 02:41:24,190
And these vicious one-liners.

2629
02:41:24,310 --> 02:41:24,670
I know.

2630
02:41:25,050 --> 02:41:25,870
He's so sassy.

2631
02:41:27,670 --> 02:41:29,430
I don't need to skip across.

2632
02:41:29,710 --> 02:41:30,670
I can...

2633
02:41:32,650 --> 02:41:34,410
I can, you know, just walk.

2634
02:41:36,110 --> 02:41:37,510
What you got here?

2635
02:41:38,150 --> 02:41:38,910
Some stuff.

2636
02:41:40,070 --> 02:41:41,670
So they have found this place.

2637
02:41:41,950 --> 02:41:43,970
They just...

2638
02:41:45,510 --> 02:41:47,430
haven't done anything with it yet.

2639
02:41:52,430 --> 02:41:53,090
Alright.

2640
02:41:55,210 --> 02:41:55,870
Nothing.

2641
02:41:56,190 --> 02:41:57,110
Can't go through there.

2642
02:41:58,010 --> 02:41:59,370
Phantom Knight, welcome to the membership.

2643
02:41:59,750 --> 02:42:00,110
Thank you!

2644
02:42:07,440 --> 02:42:07,770
Medieval.

2645
02:42:10,710 --> 02:42:12,070
I'm an archeologist.

2646
02:42:26,260 --> 02:42:27,140
Is he still up?

2647
02:42:33,160 --> 02:42:36,680
Yeah, he got me.

2648
02:42:36,800 --> 02:42:37,160
Dang.

2649
02:42:38,440 --> 02:42:38,780
It's ok.

2650
02:42:39,080 --> 02:42:39,740
I've been getting...

2651
02:42:39,740 --> 02:42:43,360
Wait, so I've been taking their bandages, but I haven't been like holding on to them?

2652
02:42:43,640 --> 02:42:44,880
That's so messed up.

2653
02:42:45,680 --> 02:42:46,580
What's the point?

2654
02:42:47,560 --> 02:42:48,500
Oh, I just...

2655
02:42:49,580 --> 02:42:50,500
What's the point?

2656
02:42:51,330 --> 02:42:55,000
So that he can't heal, but like, come on Indy!

2657
02:42:55,280 --> 02:42:56,120
Use your brain!

2658
02:43:00,500 --> 02:43:01,120
Oh,

2659
02:43:04,890 --> 02:43:07,070
this is not... Let's get this bust.

2660
02:43:09,370 --> 02:43:10,250
What's that?

2661
02:43:10,750 --> 02:43:11,930
I want that.

2662
02:43:13,010 --> 02:43:13,830
Place the bust.

2663
02:43:16,230 --> 02:43:17,130
And grab.

2664
02:43:17,790 --> 02:43:18,930
Why do we want this?

2665
02:43:18,970 --> 02:43:21,330
This is like the lamest looking thing ever.

2666
02:43:24,250 --> 02:43:25,770
How long have you been here?

2667
02:43:27,270 --> 02:43:29,410
He says it so like...

2668
02:43:30,330 --> 02:43:32,070
How long have you been here?

2669
02:43:32,330 --> 02:43:33,210
Grab the bandage.

2670
02:43:37,970 --> 02:43:38,430
Alright.

2671
02:43:42,530 --> 02:43:44,010
Exit the catacombs.

2672
02:43:45,710 --> 02:43:46,630
I'm trying!

2673
02:43:48,910 --> 02:43:50,470
I'm trying to get out of here.

2674
02:43:50,690 --> 02:43:54,650
Let me go grab... Ok, this is a little bit of backtracking, but I'm gonna go...

2675
02:43:54,650 --> 02:43:56,230
Grab a torch.

2676
02:43:56,710 --> 02:43:58,430
Dang it, I should have grabbed one earlier.

2677
02:44:01,150 --> 02:44:02,230
It's my fault.

2678
02:44:02,930 --> 02:44:04,330
Should have grabbed one earlier.

2679
02:44:09,830 --> 02:44:11,330
There's only one that I know of.

2680
02:44:11,330 --> 02:44:12,410
It's all the way down there.

2681
02:44:16,740 --> 02:44:17,760
Burn and bonk.

2682
02:44:18,080 --> 02:44:19,780
Just in case... Oh wait, is this one?

2683
02:44:20,080 --> 02:44:20,880
Yes, ok, perfect.

2684
02:44:31,260 --> 02:44:32,840
We're running, we're running... Wait.

2685
02:44:33,880 --> 02:44:34,680
What is it?

2686
02:44:35,260 --> 02:44:37,220
What is it telling me to burn?

2687
02:44:38,320 --> 02:44:39,240
Is it that?

2688
02:44:39,400 --> 02:44:40,520
No, something turned red.

2689
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:41,320
Did you guys see that?

2690
02:44:42,760 --> 02:44:44,440
I was looking over here.

2691
02:44:44,900 --> 02:44:46,740
My little cursor turned red for something.

2692
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:50,180
Mysterious.

2693
02:44:50,580 --> 02:44:50,760
Oh.

2694
02:44:51,900 --> 02:44:52,480
Nevermind.

2695
02:44:55,660 --> 02:44:59,040
I was like, I'm on the cusp of a great discovery!

2696
02:45:05,740 --> 02:45:07,620
It ain't easy being cheesy.

2697
02:45:14,940 --> 02:45:15,640
Like that.

2698
02:45:19,460 --> 02:45:20,040
Wow.

2699
02:45:22,340 --> 02:45:23,500
I like that.

2700
02:45:24,040 --> 02:45:25,280
Ok, just saved.

2701
02:45:32,660 --> 02:45:34,540
I like when it does that.

2702
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:37,020
It's so cool.

2703
02:45:39,640 --> 02:45:40,540
There's a ladder.

2704
02:45:40,800 --> 02:45:41,500
No, just kidding.

2705
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:42,380
That's a wall.

2706
02:45:48,810 --> 02:45:50,890
I'm sorry for being so dumb.

2707
02:45:57,920 --> 02:45:58,540
Ok.

2708
02:46:01,520 --> 02:46:03,020
Put my torch!

2709
02:46:03,780 --> 02:46:04,960
LT to climb the whip.

2710
02:46:05,280 --> 02:46:05,900
That's right.

2711
02:46:06,140 --> 02:46:07,320
Thank you for reminding me.

2712
02:46:12,200 --> 02:46:13,100
This way.

2713
02:46:15,260 --> 02:46:15,800
Indy, go up.

2714
02:46:17,740 --> 02:46:20,710
There's something very confusing about this game in that...

2715
02:46:21,180 --> 02:46:22,620
You press A...

2716
02:46:23,240 --> 02:46:26,300
You press basically like X to climb up.

2717
02:46:26,300 --> 02:46:27,560
Which is down.

2718
02:46:27,740 --> 02:46:28,480
You know, the bottom button.

2719
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:30,600
And then if you want to drop down...

2720
02:46:30,600 --> 02:46:33,080
You press Y, the top button.

2721
02:46:35,060 --> 02:46:36,180
It confuses me.

2722
02:46:39,780 --> 02:46:41,140
I didn't mean to jump.

2723
02:46:41,280 --> 02:46:41,920
Oh, there.

2724
02:46:42,120 --> 02:46:42,300
Ok.

2725
02:46:47,560 --> 02:46:47,980
Nice.

2726
02:46:51,760 --> 02:46:52,180
Ok.

2727
02:46:52,360 --> 02:46:52,960
Good job, Indy.

2728
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:54,940
Wait, what's that?

2729
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:56,040
Stop climbing!

2730
02:46:56,040 --> 02:46:56,140
Stop climbing.

2731
02:47:00,320 --> 02:47:00,680
And...

2732
02:47:01,220 --> 02:47:01,580
Swing!

2733
02:47:02,520 --> 02:47:03,580
Oh, I made it.

2734
02:47:03,740 --> 02:47:04,620
Oh my god, I made it.

2735
02:47:04,980 --> 02:47:06,720
I don't think I was supposed to go all the way up.

2736
02:47:08,340 --> 02:47:09,300
Actually, I'm not quite sure.

2737
02:47:11,380 --> 02:47:11,740
Whatever.

2738
02:47:18,170 --> 02:47:18,530
Spooky.

2739
02:47:22,630 --> 02:47:23,590
This is a secret.

2740
02:47:28,540 --> 02:47:28,900
Light.

2741
02:47:34,440 --> 02:47:35,900
Nice music, I know.

2742
02:47:36,760 --> 02:47:38,040
Very fits the atmosphere.

2743
02:47:39,280 --> 02:47:40,580
I think this is a secret.

2744
02:47:41,220 --> 02:47:42,200
I think this is the way out.

2745
02:47:43,960 --> 02:47:45,960
I think this is the way out.

2746
02:47:46,600 --> 02:47:47,120
Light.

2747
02:47:49,460 --> 02:47:52,420
We need something for...

2748
02:47:52,420 --> 02:47:52,960
There.

2749
02:47:56,260 --> 02:47:56,840
You.

2750
02:47:57,800 --> 02:48:00,100
Wait, if I move you...

2751
02:48:00,100 --> 02:48:01,920
I believe we'll be trapped.

2752
02:48:01,920 --> 02:48:04,040
So instead I should move you.

2753
02:48:15,940 --> 02:48:17,060
And bust.

2754
02:48:20,300 --> 02:48:20,860
Nice.

2755
02:48:22,600 --> 02:48:23,160
And...

2756
02:48:23,160 --> 02:48:24,520
Then we do this.

2757
02:48:25,360 --> 02:48:26,060
We're getting it.

2758
02:48:26,140 --> 02:48:27,680
We're so good at this game.

2759
02:48:28,220 --> 02:48:29,160
We're so good at puzzles.

2760
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:31,580
I haven't even looked through here yet.

2761
02:48:33,060 --> 02:48:34,180
Oh, that's water.

2762
02:48:43,400 --> 02:48:45,340
Do I want to go through here though?

2763
02:48:46,760 --> 02:48:48,520
Oh my gosh, this is a hole.

2764
02:48:49,840 --> 02:48:51,500
Wait, this area is huge.

2765
02:48:52,160 --> 02:48:52,880
Oh my god.

2766
02:48:53,440 --> 02:48:54,140
Okay, hold on.

2767
02:48:54,280 --> 02:48:54,840
Let's go back.

2768
02:48:55,540 --> 02:48:57,560
The other area didn't look quite as big.

2769
02:48:58,680 --> 02:48:59,200
Bustin'.

2770
02:48:59,200 --> 02:49:00,780
I thought that was a person.

2771
02:49:01,600 --> 02:49:02,120
Spooky.

2772
02:49:03,340 --> 02:49:03,860
Scary.

2773
02:49:06,100 --> 02:49:07,100
Scary spooky.

2774
02:49:07,100 --> 02:49:07,280
Spooky.

2775
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,600
Spooky spooky scary scary.

2776
02:49:12,840 --> 02:49:14,540
Does this game have maps?

2777
02:49:14,620 --> 02:49:15,080
It does.

2778
02:49:23,020 --> 02:49:29,850
We're about to go...

2779
02:49:29,850 --> 02:49:31,530
Through here, which has...

2780
02:49:31,530 --> 02:49:33,510
Which has...

2781
02:49:33,510 --> 02:49:33,770
Wait.

2782
02:49:34,850 --> 02:49:36,210
Through here.

2783
02:49:37,310 --> 02:49:39,010
It's just this thing.

2784
02:49:39,830 --> 02:49:41,630
It's just this damn relic.

2785
02:49:43,730 --> 02:49:45,630
Why do we want this?

2786
02:49:46,090 --> 02:49:47,050
I don't understand.

2787
02:49:47,170 --> 02:49:48,970
Indiana Jones, please explain it to me.

2788
02:49:53,180 --> 02:49:55,160
All that work for a little among us.

2789
02:49:56,860 --> 02:49:57,360
Okay.

2790
02:49:57,360 --> 02:49:57,860
Onwards.

2791
02:49:59,220 --> 02:50:00,420
But we get the points.

2792
02:50:00,540 --> 02:50:01,740
We get the adventurer points.

2793
02:50:01,800 --> 02:50:02,740
That's like the big deal.

2794
02:50:06,230 --> 02:50:08,030
I don't think there's anything over there.

2795
02:50:09,970 --> 02:50:10,930
Nothing in there.

2796
02:50:10,930 --> 02:50:12,130
This way.

2797
02:50:12,750 --> 02:50:14,950
But this stuff is lit up, so...

2798
02:50:15,610 --> 02:50:17,930
I'm scared that maybe perhaps...

2799
02:50:18,550 --> 02:50:19,930
Some guys are around.

2800
02:50:38,210 --> 02:50:39,810
Why the music?

2801
02:50:43,880 --> 02:50:44,960
Why is there music?

2802
02:50:46,260 --> 02:50:47,320
They don't see me.

2803
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:03,100
I want to take my... Well, I'll just take theirs.

2804
02:51:11,910 --> 02:51:12,730
Wait, wait, wait.

2805
02:51:13,170 --> 02:51:13,910
Where did they go?

2806
02:51:14,670 --> 02:51:15,350
I guess up.

2807
02:51:17,430 --> 02:51:18,250
Good job, Minky.

2808
02:51:18,490 --> 02:51:18,870
Thanks.

2809
02:51:20,710 --> 02:51:22,130
Oh, so they came from in here.

2810
02:51:23,070 --> 02:51:24,950
They were like, no, nothing in here.

2811
02:51:24,990 --> 02:51:25,390
We don't care.

2812
02:51:33,760 --> 02:51:35,680
Climb up the hole.

2813
02:51:37,260 --> 02:51:37,900
Again.

2814
02:51:38,260 --> 02:51:42,180
Oh, we really are back here.

2815
02:51:42,740 --> 02:51:43,380
Wow.

2816
02:51:47,590 --> 02:51:50,570
I'm just a priest and I fell into the hole.

2817
02:51:50,810 --> 02:51:52,170
That's so embarrassing.

2818
02:51:57,710 --> 02:52:01,290
I like how when we are Indiana Jones we have more health, actually.

2819
02:52:02,450 --> 02:52:05,950
It doesn't say this is a... This is a restricted area.

2820
02:52:06,170 --> 02:52:06,750
I'm just saying.

2821
02:52:21,380 --> 02:52:26,500
When I spend my points, did I get the extra health on Indy and not...

2822
02:52:26,500 --> 02:52:30,100
Like, did it only count for Indy and not for...

2823
02:52:31,320 --> 02:52:32,380
Anything else?

2824
02:52:32,380 --> 02:52:35,560
That'd be wild if that's the case.

2825
02:52:54,170 --> 02:52:57,030
I'm just gonna sneak past the guards.

2826
02:53:00,810 --> 02:53:00,950
Oh.

2827
02:53:02,290 --> 02:53:04,170
There are some guys noticing me.

2828
02:53:05,510 --> 02:53:07,050
Maybe that way would've been easier.

2829
02:53:07,530 --> 02:53:09,170
Seems like there's two guys over here.

2830
02:53:10,930 --> 02:53:11,270
Minky.

2831
02:53:12,890 --> 02:53:13,690
I'm Minky!

2832
02:53:24,200 --> 02:53:24,720
Ouch!

2833
02:53:35,990 --> 02:53:36,590
Oh my god.

2834
02:53:37,710 --> 02:53:38,470
Gosh, man.

2835
02:53:39,510 --> 02:53:41,010
Well, we took his bandage.

2836
02:53:41,410 --> 02:53:42,570
Hold on, let me heal.

2837
02:53:43,290 --> 02:53:44,710
And then I'm gonna take his bandage.

2838
02:53:48,770 --> 02:53:52,930
Can I please... Sometimes I press things and they don't work out the way that I want.

2839
02:53:55,950 --> 02:53:57,270
Anyway, now... Oh, no, no.

2840
02:53:57,550 --> 02:53:58,990
Wait, I wanted your bandage!

2841
02:53:59,950 --> 02:54:01,030
Oh, that's so messed up.

2842
02:54:02,810 --> 02:54:04,790
So now I used it for no reason.

2843
02:54:07,370 --> 02:54:08,950
Oh my god!

2844
02:54:12,310 --> 02:54:13,090
Oh, whatever.

2845
02:54:24,880 --> 02:54:27,140
Oh, no, I thought this one would open.

2846
02:54:28,040 --> 02:54:28,900
Where am I?

2847
02:54:30,020 --> 02:54:32,180
I know I'm supposed to go up the hole, but...

2848
02:54:33,920 --> 02:54:37,380
I can't help but think I'm lost.

2849
02:54:39,520 --> 02:54:41,020
It's a sneaking suspicion, guys.

2850
02:54:41,660 --> 02:54:42,680
Where the hell am I?

2851
02:55:02,660 --> 02:55:04,600
That's a really big circle, huh?

2852
02:55:04,820 --> 02:55:06,040
Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2853
02:55:06,660 --> 02:55:07,220
Oh, wait.

2854
02:55:07,320 --> 02:55:07,940
How did I... Wait.

2855
02:55:07,940 --> 02:55:09,940
What door...

2856
02:55:16,800 --> 02:55:17,640
This one.

2857
02:55:20,580 --> 02:55:22,100
The great circle.

2858
02:55:26,400 --> 02:55:26,960
Absolutely.

2859
02:55:29,400 --> 02:55:31,340
I'm keep knocking everybody out.

2860
02:55:31,540 --> 02:55:32,260
Or killing them.

2861
02:55:32,340 --> 02:55:33,960
There's not gonna be anybody left in this town.

2862
02:55:34,520 --> 02:55:35,580
When I'm through with it.

2863
02:55:37,220 --> 02:55:38,820
What is... Someone noticed me?

2864
02:55:39,300 --> 02:55:39,680
No.

2865
02:55:50,850 --> 02:55:51,770
I'm sneaking.

2866
02:55:55,170 --> 02:55:58,010
Yeah, we went in here, but there was nothing in here.

2867
02:55:58,450 --> 02:56:00,110
I don't think there's still anything in here.

2868
02:56:01,910 --> 02:56:04,750
Doesn't seem like it, at least at the moment.

2869
02:56:11,620 --> 02:56:14,500
We can at least... It's a good vantage point, I guess.

2870
02:56:16,840 --> 02:56:18,560
Guys, I don't remember how to use my gun.

2871
02:56:19,580 --> 02:56:21,400
I think that might be important to remember.

2872
02:56:22,040 --> 02:56:23,000
Just saying.

2873
02:56:26,270 --> 02:56:27,170
Oh, these guys.

2874
02:56:27,570 --> 02:56:30,350
Think he

2875
02:56:33,830 --> 02:56:34,190
sees me?

2876
02:56:35,350 --> 02:56:36,950
Did he just go...

2877
02:56:37,420 --> 02:56:38,310
Left on the D-pad.

2878
02:56:38,410 --> 02:56:38,910
Thank you!

2879
02:56:46,780 --> 02:56:47,910
They're getting better at guarding.

2880
02:56:49,130 --> 02:56:49,810
Oh my god.

2881
02:56:59,240 --> 02:57:00,500
Hold your horses!

2882
02:57:06,120 --> 02:57:07,980
It's the fact that they just like...

2883
02:57:10,420 --> 02:57:12,000
Whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle.

2884
02:57:12,700 --> 02:57:14,580
We don't notice a single thing.

2885
02:57:16,920 --> 02:57:18,300
I don't know where to put this guy.

2886
02:57:18,420 --> 02:57:20,160
I was gonna try and hide their bodies, but...

2887
02:57:20,540 --> 02:57:21,620
I think I can take these two.

2888
02:57:58,970 --> 02:58:00,090
My bandages.

2889
02:58:03,580 --> 02:58:05,600
That medic really screwed me over.

2890
02:58:08,560 --> 02:58:09,840
Is there another guy?

2891
02:58:10,860 --> 02:58:14,460
I know I don't have to take all the guys down, but...

2892
02:58:15,160 --> 02:58:16,140
Remember to eat.

2893
02:58:16,580 --> 02:58:17,580
Yeah, let's eat.

2894
02:58:18,620 --> 02:58:20,260
There's a lot of fruit around town.

2895
02:58:28,610 --> 02:58:29,910
I'll just save this one.

2896
02:58:33,530 --> 02:58:34,450
Alright, nice.

2897
02:58:35,670 --> 02:58:36,870
I think we took them all out.

2898
02:58:39,570 --> 02:58:41,890
I'll take your... whatever.

2899
02:58:57,730 --> 02:58:59,190
Did not take them all out.

2900
02:59:16,200 --> 02:59:16,900
Oh, I see him.

2901
02:59:24,680 --> 02:59:27,880
Yo, it just used up all the extra stamina that I saved up.

2902
02:59:32,920 --> 02:59:39,060
Gameplay style is actually pretty accurate, because movie Indy does get himself beat up quite a bit before winning fights too.

2903
02:59:41,280 --> 02:59:44,840
You know, you being bad is actually accurate.

2904
02:59:46,540 --> 02:59:48,360
Thanks for the confidence boost.

2905
02:59:53,490 --> 02:59:55,130
It is true though.

2906
02:59:55,770 --> 02:59:58,270
Indy, you know, he is a good...

2907
02:59:59,870 --> 03:00:03,470
Adventurer, but he does get his ass beat a lot a lot.

2908
03:00:06,980 --> 03:00:10,140
Sorry, I was really tired.

2909
03:00:12,440 --> 03:00:13,000
Sorry.

2910
03:00:14,020 --> 03:00:15,720
Okay, let's try and go up the hall.

2911
03:00:18,100 --> 03:00:18,980
Floating helmet?

2912
03:00:19,600 --> 03:00:20,160
No.

2913
03:00:20,720 --> 03:00:21,960
Looked like it was for a second.

2914
03:00:27,170 --> 03:00:28,270
How do I?

2915
03:00:29,250 --> 03:00:30,070
Go through here?

2916
03:00:30,930 --> 03:00:31,570
I suppose.

2917
03:00:37,470 --> 03:00:38,870
I guess through here?

2918
03:00:40,990 --> 03:00:42,010
Wait, no!

2919
03:00:48,670 --> 03:00:50,190
We went through here.

2920
03:01:05,520 --> 03:01:08,480
They are just chilling, staring at the wall.

2921
03:01:09,860 --> 03:01:11,360
I think they are having their own moment.

2922
03:01:33,520 --> 03:01:35,900
La la la la la la la la.

2923
03:01:39,580 --> 03:01:41,980
La la la la la la la la.

2924
03:01:42,620 --> 03:01:44,240
Oh my gosh, the sunlight.

2925
03:01:46,200 --> 03:01:47,580
La la la la la.

2926
03:01:48,900 --> 03:01:50,440
I think I can grab that.

2927
03:01:54,860 --> 03:01:57,640
I think I should also change.

2928
03:01:59,420 --> 03:02:00,160
Wrong thing.

2929
03:02:01,160 --> 03:02:02,260
Let's put on my suit.

2930
03:02:04,040 --> 03:02:04,820
Lovely.

2931
03:02:07,640 --> 03:02:11,040
Oh, I'm back here.

2932
03:02:11,660 --> 03:02:12,920
Oh, this is a restricted zone.

2933
03:02:19,930 --> 03:02:21,490
Hot lady.

2934
03:02:24,730 --> 03:02:25,930
What are you doing?

2935
03:02:26,930 --> 03:02:27,630
Argh!

2936
03:02:30,470 --> 03:02:32,250
I fell in there!

2937
03:02:32,810 --> 03:02:34,570
I'm such a silly clumsy priest.

2938
03:02:35,590 --> 03:02:41,820
He helped me!

2939
03:02:44,030 --> 03:02:45,640
Unlike all these other guys.

2940
03:02:53,960 --> 03:02:54,720
Madame.

2941
03:02:55,920 --> 03:02:57,460
G.E.D.

2942
03:02:59,460 --> 03:03:00,260
Oh?

2943
03:03:03,300 --> 03:03:04,600
Yeah, pretty.

2944
03:03:05,800 --> 03:03:07,000
Pretty lady.

2945
03:03:09,740 --> 03:03:10,920
Lockpicking nun.

2946
03:03:13,200 --> 03:03:16,120
Is everyone still in this area all down?

2947
03:03:16,720 --> 03:03:18,020
Or they just leave?

2948
03:03:20,940 --> 03:03:22,380
I don't see anyone.

2949
03:03:23,400 --> 03:03:24,100
Here we go.

2950
03:03:30,700 --> 03:03:35,880
She's probably right here and she's going to get us with a knife against our neck.

2951
03:03:42,620 --> 03:03:43,780
Apostolic Palace.

2952
03:03:44,780 --> 03:03:45,680
What do we have here?

2953
03:03:46,640 --> 03:03:47,540
Oh no!

2954
03:03:48,480 --> 03:03:50,900
The Japanese bombs killed hundreds in Shanghai.

2955
03:03:51,160 --> 03:03:51,700
Oh no!

2956
03:03:52,280 --> 03:03:59,340
Japanese air raid has shocked Nantou, a district in the city of Shanghai killing hundreds of Chinese civilians and wounding hundreds more.

2957
03:03:59,340 --> 03:04:06,840
No warning has been issued by the Japanese army which had previously promised to give for the civilian population to leave the area.

2958
03:04:07,240 --> 03:04:11,840
Around 3 million people live in Shanghai making it one of the largest cities in the world.

2959
03:04:15,880 --> 03:04:18,720
I think that's an understatement.

2960
03:04:19,040 --> 03:04:19,660
Indiana Jones.

2961
03:04:21,480 --> 03:04:22,320
Oh right!

2962
03:04:22,440 --> 03:04:23,500
We can unlock this now.

2963
03:04:24,720 --> 03:04:25,540
Good, good, good.

2964
03:04:31,100 --> 03:04:32,840
War never changes.

2965
03:04:39,550 --> 03:04:41,430
I can't tell, it's really decorative.

2966
03:04:48,210 --> 03:04:48,990
What's that?

2967
03:04:49,050 --> 03:04:49,170
Oh.

2968
03:04:51,110 --> 03:04:52,010
Take that.

2969
03:04:52,830 --> 03:04:53,570
Repair kit.

2970
03:04:55,250 --> 03:04:56,350
Is this a door?

2971
03:04:56,530 --> 03:04:56,770
No.

2972
03:04:57,710 --> 03:04:58,450
Pretend door.

2973
03:04:58,850 --> 03:04:59,830
Make you really confused.

2974
03:05:01,030 --> 03:05:02,230
I got the clerical key.

2975
03:05:04,570 --> 03:05:05,930
I hear someone talking.

2976
03:05:06,590 --> 03:05:07,150
I hear her.

2977
03:05:08,730 --> 03:05:13,430
Uh, anyone see a nun?

2978
03:05:14,690 --> 03:05:18,170
What do you mean by that, Andy?

2979
03:05:24,090 --> 03:05:26,490
He's so stupid sometimes.

2980
03:05:28,230 --> 03:05:29,310
Nice.

2981
03:05:32,550 --> 03:05:37,530
My dear fellow Wisp brethren, which version of our favorite ghost maid is the wiggliest?

2982
03:05:38,250 --> 03:05:42,250
Mint 1.0, 2.0, 2.0 in small form, 3.0 chibi or chibi...

2983
03:05:42,250 --> 03:05:44,610
Wait, what's 2.0 in small form?

2984
03:05:45,710 --> 03:05:47,950
Welcome to membership, thank you.

2985
03:05:52,950 --> 03:05:54,490
Whoa, oh god.

2986
03:05:55,030 --> 03:05:56,030
Oh my god,

2987
03:05:59,320 --> 03:06:01,220
I don't think there's something right in this city.

2988
03:06:04,140 --> 03:06:06,800
I think there's something really wrong here.

2989
03:06:07,340 --> 03:06:14,800
If I

2990
03:06:18,860 --> 03:06:20,400
get close to her, she's fine.

2991
03:06:21,660 --> 03:06:23,100
But, you know...

2992
03:06:23,100 --> 03:06:26,740
She might be a lizard person.

2993
03:06:29,100 --> 03:06:31,820
When I back up, she's like...

2994
03:06:31,820 --> 03:06:32,440
Oh my god!

2995
03:06:37,020 --> 03:06:39,540
Samuel, thank you for...

2996
03:06:39,540 --> 03:06:41,760
Well, I mean, membership, welcome to membership.

2997
03:06:42,200 --> 03:06:43,900
Because I thank you for the joining.

2998
03:06:45,420 --> 03:06:46,700
Oh my goodness.

2999
03:06:47,420 --> 03:06:49,020
Oh, a priestess card.

3000
03:06:52,400 --> 03:06:55,720
A tarot card depicting the high priestess major Arcana.

3001
03:06:57,320 --> 03:06:58,640
She knows too much.

3002
03:07:00,960 --> 03:07:01,920
I'm also praying.

3003
03:07:07,720 --> 03:07:10,520
Everybody else is fine, but this is the imposter.

3004
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:11,600
Everybody...

3005
03:07:12,300 --> 03:07:14,080
I found the imposter.

3006
03:07:15,320 --> 03:07:16,180
Excuse me.

3007
03:07:16,380 --> 03:07:17,040
Ok, nevermind.

3008
03:07:20,040 --> 03:07:21,160
Oh, we found her.

3009
03:07:22,300 --> 03:07:24,940
I took so much time staring at other women.

3010
03:07:38,680 --> 03:07:40,380
Watching the Minky on the telly.

3011
03:07:40,460 --> 03:07:41,400
Thank you.

3012
03:08:04,760 --> 03:08:05,480
Rude.

3013
03:08:07,800 --> 03:08:09,320
Oh my gosh, it's parking.

3014
03:08:12,340 --> 03:08:13,060
Zeppelin.

3015
03:08:23,690 --> 03:08:24,690
Daaaa!

3016
03:08:25,390 --> 03:08:26,170
Mamma mia!

3017
03:08:28,790 --> 03:08:29,290
Welcome...

3018
03:08:30,210 --> 03:08:33,230
...to the top of this building.

3019
03:08:33,570 --> 03:08:35,530
It's pretty dangerous meeting up here.

3020
03:08:40,050 --> 03:08:41,890
It's Emerick Voss!

3021
03:08:42,890 --> 03:08:43,710
No!

3022
03:08:46,450 --> 03:08:48,010
It's Emerick Voss!

3023
03:08:49,850 --> 03:08:53,290
Five mints?

3024
03:08:53,390 --> 03:08:53,830
Months?

3025
03:08:54,170 --> 03:08:55,490
Five mints!

3026
03:08:58,950 --> 03:09:02,130
Why do you have that?

3027
03:09:11,890 --> 03:09:12,410
Who?

3028
03:09:29,510 --> 03:09:32,310
Emerick Voss!

3029
03:09:42,010 --> 03:09:43,650
We've been six for eight months.

3030
03:09:50,130 --> 03:09:51,170
A cat!

3031
03:09:53,630 --> 03:09:55,110
A cat mommy.

3032
03:10:02,350 --> 03:10:04,170
Alex D, thank you for the three months!

3033
03:10:12,010 --> 03:10:13,670
What about this?

3034
03:10:15,090 --> 03:10:17,130
We ear anything that could be of interest to the other.

3035
03:10:17,990 --> 03:10:19,010
We trade information.

3036
03:10:20,650 --> 03:10:21,250
Deal?

3037
03:10:22,210 --> 03:10:22,810
Deal.

3038
03:10:23,370 --> 03:10:24,190
Yeah, alright.

3039
03:10:24,670 --> 03:10:25,830
Mr. Lombardi, deal.

3040
03:10:26,690 --> 03:10:27,290
Good.

3041
03:10:28,150 --> 03:10:29,350
You can call me Gina.

3042
03:10:31,090 --> 03:10:32,550
See you around, Strambo.

3043
03:10:33,470 --> 03:10:34,070
Strambo.

3044
03:10:35,590 --> 03:10:37,510
That's the spaghetti Rambo.

3045
03:10:39,030 --> 03:10:40,610
We should definitely bring this back to the library.

3046
03:10:40,610 --> 03:10:41,730
Yes.

3047
03:10:42,410 --> 03:10:44,430
Bring the parchment to Antonio.

3048
03:10:45,710 --> 03:10:47,630
Where the hell are we?

3049
03:10:48,410 --> 03:10:48,730
Wow!

3050
03:10:51,050 --> 03:10:52,290
Look at it up there!

3051
03:10:53,450 --> 03:10:54,950
It's so still.

3052
03:10:55,570 --> 03:10:58,670
I mean it has to be for people to disembark, but...

3053
03:10:58,670 --> 03:11:00,150
Wow, what a great view!

3054
03:11:00,950 --> 03:11:01,770
It's so cool.

3055
03:11:02,230 --> 03:11:03,110
Oh, I can take a picture.

3056
03:11:03,910 --> 03:11:04,710
Oh, sorry.

3057
03:11:04,710 --> 03:11:04,770
Sorry.

3058
03:11:09,710 --> 03:11:10,830
Anchored airship.

3059
03:11:11,050 --> 03:11:12,090
Wait, hold on.

3060
03:11:20,960 --> 03:11:22,600
Can I leave from here?

3061
03:11:26,140 --> 03:11:28,280
I don't think I should.

3062
03:11:29,780 --> 03:11:30,240
But what?

3063
03:11:30,520 --> 03:11:31,840
I mean, maybe I can.

3064
03:11:35,230 --> 03:11:36,810
Actually, it's telling me to.

3065
03:11:37,570 --> 03:11:38,130
So...

3066
03:11:38,890 --> 03:11:39,790
Whoopsie-daisy!

3067
03:11:44,810 --> 03:11:46,410
Oh, dang it.

3068
03:11:46,450 --> 03:11:48,810
I did the thing again where I told you if I...

3069
03:11:49,650 --> 03:11:51,330
I hit up, but...

3070
03:11:54,150 --> 03:11:55,990
There's something not right in the city.

3071
03:11:56,370 --> 03:11:57,330
My god.

3072
03:11:58,390 --> 03:11:59,510
The city...

3073
03:12:08,810 --> 03:12:10,370
Oh, no.

3074
03:12:16,670 --> 03:12:18,230
This game...

3075
03:12:18,230 --> 03:12:20,230
No, no, no.

3076
03:12:20,470 --> 03:12:23,730
No, I did everything right!

3077
03:12:25,230 --> 03:12:27,150
I did everything correctly!

3078
03:12:27,930 --> 03:12:29,570
Oh, I think I'm supposed to take this.

3079
03:12:40,200 --> 03:12:40,880
Fruit bag.

3080
03:12:41,800 --> 03:12:43,340
Carry twice the amount of fruit.

3081
03:12:43,980 --> 03:12:44,780
Love that.

3082
03:12:54,300 --> 03:12:54,860
Anyway...

3083
03:12:56,500 --> 03:12:57,660
What's in here, anyway?

3084
03:13:02,860 --> 03:13:04,440
I can't take them.

3085
03:13:04,600 --> 03:13:05,800
I have very low health.

3086
03:13:07,240 --> 03:13:08,740
But I'm gonna take that.

3087
03:13:09,260 --> 03:13:09,400
Okay.

3088
03:13:11,480 --> 03:13:12,840
Important stuff down there?

3089
03:13:12,880 --> 03:13:13,160
Really?

3090
03:13:15,440 --> 03:13:15,920
Really?

3091
03:13:18,400 --> 03:13:19,920
But my low health...

3092
03:13:20,840 --> 03:13:22,920
What if I...

3093
03:13:22,920 --> 03:13:23,280
What the?

3094
03:13:23,520 --> 03:13:24,180
That's not a gun.

3095
03:13:24,540 --> 03:13:25,060
Excuse me?

3096
03:13:26,420 --> 03:13:28,040
Where did my gun go?

3097
03:13:28,220 --> 03:13:29,000
What is this?

3098
03:13:29,940 --> 03:13:32,160
Why do I have a staff?

3099
03:13:32,220 --> 03:13:33,900
Why do I have like a Goku staff?

3100
03:13:34,020 --> 03:13:34,640
What is this?

3101
03:13:37,300 --> 03:13:38,580
Oh, change outfit.

3102
03:13:38,580 --> 03:13:39,420
Okay,

3103
03:13:49,680 --> 03:13:50,800
is this the aim?

3104
03:13:51,100 --> 03:13:52,240
This is the aim.

3105
03:14:05,220 --> 03:14:06,260
Oh, reload.

3106
03:14:08,060 --> 03:14:09,100
That's RT.

3107
03:14:15,160 --> 03:14:16,720
Why don't you come up here?

3108
03:14:16,800 --> 03:14:18,480
I will go down once you're done, baby.

3109
03:14:18,480 --> 03:14:20,680
Oh, dammit.

3110
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:21,760
Stop dancing.

3111
03:14:22,420 --> 03:14:26,620
Cut it out.

3112
03:14:31,370 --> 03:14:32,010
Indy?

3113
03:14:32,930 --> 03:14:34,170
That's kinda messed up.

3114
03:14:35,870 --> 03:14:36,250
Anyway.

3115
03:14:37,770 --> 03:14:39,290
I'm a man of the cloth.

3116
03:14:42,170 --> 03:14:43,010
Cool.

3117
03:14:43,510 --> 03:14:44,210
So we did that.

3118
03:14:49,620 --> 03:14:50,460
Okay.

3119
03:14:51,120 --> 03:14:51,780
And down.

3120
03:14:53,420 --> 03:14:54,480
Oh my gosh, I did it again.

3121
03:14:54,840 --> 03:14:55,220
No!

3122
03:14:57,300 --> 03:14:57,900
Okay.

3123
03:14:58,920 --> 03:14:59,600
Down.

3124
03:15:00,100 --> 03:15:00,540
Down.

3125
03:15:01,120 --> 03:15:01,660
Down.

3126
03:15:02,300 --> 03:15:02,880
Down.

3127
03:15:03,680 --> 03:15:04,260
Down.

3128
03:15:04,880 --> 03:15:05,400
Down.

3129
03:15:06,860 --> 03:15:07,840
Try with B?

3130
03:15:12,060 --> 03:15:13,120
Thanks, guys.

3131
03:15:15,680 --> 03:15:16,360
Wowee!

3132
03:15:17,240 --> 03:15:18,080
Oh, picture.

3133
03:15:19,100 --> 03:15:21,160
Oh yeah, they did have this thing right here.

3134
03:15:23,760 --> 03:15:25,280
Strange inscription.

3135
03:15:30,060 --> 03:15:31,400
Eighth inscription.

3136
03:15:36,920 --> 03:15:37,760
Yes!

3137
03:15:41,060 --> 03:15:41,760
Thank you guys!

3138
03:15:42,340 --> 03:15:43,600
Thank you guys!

3139
03:15:44,120 --> 03:15:45,700
Enter the boxing ring!

3140
03:15:46,300 --> 03:15:47,140
No way.

3141
03:15:48,020 --> 03:15:48,780
Thank you guys.

3142
03:15:48,860 --> 03:15:49,240
Thank you.

3143
03:15:49,440 --> 03:15:50,680
Thank you guys.

3144
03:15:50,800 --> 03:15:51,240
Thank you.

3145
03:15:53,460 --> 03:15:55,600
Take all my Google Rewards money.

3146
03:15:56,380 --> 03:15:58,460
I also use the Google Rewards.

3147
03:15:59,700 --> 03:16:01,400
Except I use it in Gacha.

3148
03:16:02,600 --> 03:16:03,920
Aww, thanks.

3149
03:16:06,140 --> 03:16:08,240
Those take like so long to collect.

3150
03:16:08,880 --> 03:16:09,780
Take that donut.

3151
03:16:10,880 --> 03:16:12,640
Take the medicine bottle.

3152
03:16:12,860 --> 03:16:13,700
Any other...

3153
03:16:13,700 --> 03:16:15,780
There's gotta be more medicine in there.

3154
03:16:19,450 --> 03:16:21,190
Wait, so now...

3155
03:16:23,990 --> 03:16:25,350
Oh my gosh.

3156
03:16:26,150 --> 03:16:27,670
I can go anywhere I please!

3157
03:16:29,770 --> 03:16:32,510
Was there anywhere else that needed a photo?

3158
03:16:37,920 --> 03:16:39,880
I kept getting like a little thing.

3159
03:16:39,980 --> 03:16:40,940
Oh, washing tent.

3160
03:16:41,520 --> 03:16:41,820
Really?

3161
03:16:43,280 --> 03:16:44,460
Indy, you freak.

3162
03:16:50,500 --> 03:16:52,000
Now I have all access.

3163
03:16:52,960 --> 03:16:55,320
Thank you guys for making me come down here.

3164
03:17:00,400 --> 03:17:01,240
Go up, Indy.

3165
03:17:01,400 --> 03:17:01,780
Oh gosh.

3166
03:17:02,580 --> 03:17:03,240
You can make it.

3167
03:17:03,800 --> 03:17:04,460
You can make it.

3168
03:17:04,900 --> 03:17:05,880
You can make it.

3169
03:17:06,460 --> 03:17:06,820
Nice.

3170
03:17:08,660 --> 03:17:09,100
Nice.

3171
03:17:13,720 --> 03:17:15,020
I missed some money?

3172
03:17:15,240 --> 03:17:15,760
It's okay.

3173
03:17:15,880 --> 03:17:16,500
Don't worry about it.

3174
03:17:19,000 --> 03:17:19,740
It's fine.

3175
03:17:27,460 --> 03:17:29,780
Alright, we are going back to the...

3176
03:17:31,720 --> 03:17:34,260
I know exactly where we are.

3177
03:17:36,220 --> 03:17:38,340
Just don't get spotted by the captains.

3178
03:17:38,520 --> 03:17:39,080
Got it.

3179
03:17:40,380 --> 03:17:41,080
Hello!

3180
03:17:41,600 --> 03:17:42,300
Is this a captain?

3181
03:17:45,600 --> 03:17:45,980
Ciao!

3182
03:17:55,070 --> 03:17:55,830
Ciao!

3183
03:18:00,930 --> 03:18:01,690
Ciao!

3184
03:18:04,970 --> 03:18:05,510
Ciao!

3185
03:18:10,610 --> 03:18:11,310
Ciao!

3186
03:18:12,650 --> 03:18:13,230
Ciao!

3187
03:18:18,120 --> 03:18:19,520
Ciao!

3188
03:18:27,050 --> 03:18:30,970
Fast travel is over here.

3189
03:18:32,090 --> 03:18:33,150
I think.

3190
03:18:34,750 --> 03:18:35,170
Bless you.

3191
03:18:38,870 --> 03:18:40,590
Yeah, right here.

3192
03:18:40,590 --> 03:18:44,910
We are trying to go to the courtyard?

3193
03:18:46,430 --> 03:18:47,570
The courtyard.

3194
03:18:51,480 --> 03:18:52,760
Very nice.

3195
03:18:54,200 --> 03:18:55,100
Good job, Indy.

3196
03:18:55,900 --> 03:18:58,720
Will they let us inside the...

3197
03:18:59,600 --> 03:19:00,220
Ciao!

3198
03:19:00,760 --> 03:19:00,960
Hey!

3199
03:19:06,860 --> 03:19:09,500
Will they let us inside here?

3200
03:19:14,040 --> 03:19:15,040
Mmm.

3201
03:19:25,220 --> 03:19:26,220
Nice.

3202
03:19:31,420 --> 03:19:33,140
She'll never recover.

3203
03:19:34,660 --> 03:19:35,420
Okay, good.

3204
03:19:36,100 --> 03:19:37,500
Requires clerical suit.

3205
03:19:38,260 --> 03:19:41,220
Well, since I'm not being perceived...

3206
03:19:41,220 --> 03:19:43,300
I think I'm just going to go right over here.

3207
03:19:46,120 --> 03:19:47,360
And change.

3208
03:19:50,720 --> 03:19:51,340
Nice.

3209
03:19:53,500 --> 03:19:54,120
Nicholas!

3210
03:19:54,840 --> 03:19:55,460
Welcome to the membership.

3211
03:19:55,680 --> 03:19:56,440
Thank you!

3212
03:20:05,340 --> 03:20:06,300
Damn right, Indy.

3213
03:20:06,300 --> 03:20:07,380
I bet I did, yeah.

3214
03:20:09,380 --> 03:20:09,940
Take it.

3215
03:20:12,440 --> 03:20:13,360
You want to see it?

3216
03:20:13,920 --> 03:20:14,620
You want to see it?

3217
03:20:15,680 --> 03:20:16,640
You want to see it?

3218
03:20:17,300 --> 03:20:18,200
You want to see it?

3219
03:20:18,680 --> 03:20:19,740
You want to see it?

3220
03:20:20,280 --> 03:20:21,300
You want to see it?

3221
03:20:22,080 --> 03:20:23,000
You want to see it?

3222
03:20:23,900 --> 03:20:24,480
Take it!

3223
03:20:28,340 --> 03:20:30,180
I'm going to have a bit of a snack.

3224
03:20:36,780 --> 03:20:39,160
Amity got me some cheese bites.

3225
03:20:53,440 --> 03:20:54,360
Investigate the fountain.

3226
03:20:56,100 --> 03:20:57,340
Wow, these are really crunchy.

3227
03:20:57,580 --> 03:20:57,680
Sorry.

3228
03:21:06,370 --> 03:21:06,970
Hold on.

3229
03:21:07,030 --> 03:21:08,450
My YouTube chat broke again.

3230
03:21:08,970 --> 03:21:09,930
I'm so sorry you guys.

3231
03:21:10,050 --> 03:21:10,610
I have to refresh.

3232
03:21:13,490 --> 03:21:14,290
Augur.

3233
03:21:24,230 --> 03:21:25,870
Cheese bite ASMR.

3234
03:21:26,090 --> 03:21:26,290
Yeah!

3235
03:21:28,130 --> 03:21:30,310
I got to meet up with Amity.

3236
03:21:32,410 --> 03:21:36,270
I got to meet up with Amity and Sunny and Mogu!

3237
03:21:38,890 --> 03:21:40,010
And Mogu.

3238
03:21:40,170 --> 03:21:41,150
She's so sweet.

3239
03:21:41,530 --> 03:21:43,310
She made a little...

3240
03:21:44,370 --> 03:21:46,490
Like a little...

3241
03:21:46,490 --> 03:21:49,890
Wisp keychain that she made herself.

3242
03:21:50,610 --> 03:21:53,330
You know when you use the pins on the felt?

3243
03:21:56,570 --> 03:21:59,070
So I got to say hi to everybody.

3244
03:22:03,830 --> 03:22:05,410
Okay, now I change again.

3245
03:22:08,170 --> 03:22:09,470
We're going to the fountain.

3246
03:22:13,570 --> 03:22:17,030
To the fountain, to the fountain, to the fountain...

3247
03:22:17,030 --> 03:22:19,810
This way.

3248
03:22:21,410 --> 03:22:21,890
Wait.

3249
03:22:22,790 --> 03:22:23,430
Where is the fountain?

3250
03:22:24,310 --> 03:22:24,810
This way.

3251
03:22:32,190 --> 03:22:33,610
Any loose ends?

3252
03:22:34,230 --> 03:22:35,070
A nun in trouble?

3253
03:22:38,310 --> 03:22:40,290
What do you mean a nun in here?

3254
03:22:42,810 --> 03:22:43,310
Hello.

3255
03:22:45,550 --> 03:22:46,670
Thank you.

3256
03:22:47,010 --> 03:22:49,150
Oh no, no, no.

3257
03:22:49,210 --> 03:22:50,970
It might be a bad idea.

3258
03:22:51,790 --> 03:22:52,610
We're fine.

3259
03:22:53,070 --> 03:22:53,490
We're okay.

3260
03:22:54,510 --> 03:22:55,570
We're fine, probably.

3261
03:22:57,610 --> 03:22:58,130
Hi.

3262
03:23:01,610 --> 03:23:03,410
I saw a camera thing.

3263
03:23:05,250 --> 03:23:06,250
Camera for where?

3264
03:23:08,930 --> 03:23:09,670
Where?

3265
03:23:10,670 --> 03:23:11,570
Ornate door.

3266
03:23:16,090 --> 03:23:16,830
Okay.

3267
03:23:17,670 --> 03:23:21,330
Now time to steal some stuff.

3268
03:23:23,510 --> 03:23:25,770
I used to be handsome too.

3269
03:23:33,910 --> 03:23:34,650
Hello.

3270
03:23:40,170 --> 03:23:42,310
They're watching me like a hawk, man.

3271
03:23:45,270 --> 03:23:48,590
I'm going to take a look.

3272
03:23:51,410 --> 03:23:52,810
Take.

3273
03:23:57,850 --> 03:23:58,970
Take.

3274
03:23:59,710 --> 03:24:00,430
Okay.

3275
03:24:06,070 --> 03:24:07,510
Hey, buddy.

3276
03:24:09,450 --> 03:24:12,030
Steal a hundred.

3277
03:24:12,510 --> 03:24:15,230
A hundred euros.

3278
03:24:15,230 --> 03:24:15,490
Euros!

3279
03:24:17,550 --> 03:24:19,650
I got to put this guy to sleep for good.

3280
03:24:22,370 --> 03:24:23,390
Oh, nothing?

3281
03:24:25,110 --> 03:24:26,450
Stop staring at me.

3282
03:24:40,730 --> 03:24:41,570
Turn around.

3283
03:24:41,910 --> 03:24:43,150
I want to go to the other place.

3284
03:24:47,890 --> 03:24:48,730
Over here.

3285
03:24:49,890 --> 03:24:51,930
I thought there was a nun in here that was in trouble.

3286
03:24:53,130 --> 03:24:54,010
What's this?

3287
03:24:54,750 --> 03:24:55,930
Open it up.

3288
03:25:01,980 --> 03:25:03,060
What's this?

3289
03:25:03,960 --> 03:25:04,760
Shipment report.

3290
03:25:05,100 --> 03:25:06,180
Lock shipment wall open.

3291
03:25:06,520 --> 03:25:07,440
Contents are confidential.

3292
03:25:07,660 --> 03:25:08,000
Urgent.

3293
03:25:09,240 --> 03:25:09,680
Signature.

3294
03:25:09,780 --> 03:25:11,740
Hector de Luca.

3295
03:25:13,780 --> 03:25:14,960
Counter signature.

3296
03:25:15,220 --> 03:25:15,520
M.

3297
03:25:15,780 --> 03:25:16,220
Barone.

3298
03:25:18,560 --> 03:25:19,760
Additional notes.

3299
03:25:19,880 --> 03:25:20,240
Geo.

3300
03:25:20,900 --> 03:25:27,380
Most likely, Centurione de Luca decoded the key for the wrong day.

3301
03:25:29,800 --> 03:25:30,920
It's a Lyra sign.

3302
03:25:30,960 --> 03:25:31,800
What's a Lyra sign?

3303
03:25:31,900 --> 03:25:32,300
What's that?

3304
03:25:33,720 --> 03:25:35,100
Check your journal for side quests.

3305
03:25:35,200 --> 03:25:35,460
True.

3306
03:25:37,500 --> 03:25:43,600
Easy fix, but you should make him wait his turn or next we'll be tying his shoes for him too.

3307
03:25:47,560 --> 03:25:48,040
Confidential.

3308
03:25:51,260 --> 03:25:52,100
Brawler?

3309
03:25:53,040 --> 03:25:54,600
I'll take that.

3310
03:25:56,080 --> 03:25:56,520
Absolutely.

3311
03:25:57,280 --> 03:25:58,960
What are we learning?

3312
03:26:01,780 --> 03:26:02,880
What are we learning?

3313
03:26:04,060 --> 03:26:06,460
Brawler, brawler, brawler, brawler.

3314
03:26:08,240 --> 03:26:12,040
Deal increased damage in armed and hand-to-hand melee combat.

3315
03:26:15,680 --> 03:26:16,100
Nice.

3316
03:26:16,100 --> 03:26:16,220
Nice.

3317
03:26:24,260 --> 03:26:27,200
Where do I see... let's see.

3318
03:26:28,220 --> 03:26:30,000
Fieldwork at the Mad Priest.

3319
03:26:30,180 --> 03:26:30,980
A nun in trouble.

3320
03:26:31,760 --> 03:26:33,280
The secret of giants.

3321
03:26:34,020 --> 03:26:35,260
A savage discovery.

3322
03:26:36,860 --> 03:26:38,300
What's a Mad Priest?

3323
03:26:39,560 --> 03:26:45,560
There's a Sister Catherine in Sistine Chapel waiting for a delivery boy from Antonio.

3324
03:26:46,060 --> 03:26:52,380
It concerns Father Kijinju, the Bad Priest who made the map of secret inscriptions.

3325
03:26:53,680 --> 03:26:54,560
So I need...

3326
03:26:56,040 --> 03:26:57,480
Find Sister Catherine.

3327
03:26:58,340 --> 03:26:59,400
Let's track that one.

3328
03:26:59,900 --> 03:27:01,600
Talk to Gina, track... oh.

3329
03:27:02,080 --> 03:27:03,240
I can only track one at a time.

3330
03:27:10,310 --> 03:27:11,610
No, no, no, no.

3331
03:27:15,020 --> 03:27:15,900
No, no, no.

3332
03:27:15,900 --> 03:27:16,480
Oh.

3333
03:27:21,440 --> 03:27:22,300
So close.

3334
03:27:23,940 --> 03:27:25,800
Tales of dread.

3335
03:27:27,100 --> 03:27:31,040
Be amazed by this horrible tale of darkness, death and descent into madness.

3336
03:27:32,600 --> 03:27:32,840
Thank you.

3337
03:27:35,580 --> 03:27:39,020
Good thing nobody saw me steal it.

3338
03:27:39,020 --> 03:27:39,060
Yeah.

3339
03:27:42,060 --> 03:27:44,120
Did Moku stink like we all suspected?

3340
03:27:44,840 --> 03:27:45,900
What do you mean stink?

3341
03:27:47,140 --> 03:27:48,340
She smells lovely.

3342
03:27:53,450 --> 03:27:53,890
Indeed.

3343
03:27:54,490 --> 03:27:56,470
He has such a fast hand, you know.

3344
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:06,280
I wanted to go back in there.

3345
03:28:07,120 --> 03:28:08,640
I guess I didn't need anything.

3346
03:28:08,760 --> 03:28:10,960
I think there was one more thing I wanted in there.

3347
03:28:18,300 --> 03:28:19,720
Nothing in here maybe.

3348
03:28:21,060 --> 03:28:21,820
Oh wait.

3349
03:28:22,400 --> 03:28:23,180
Do any of these open?

3350
03:28:24,720 --> 03:28:25,280
Bandage.

3351
03:28:26,700 --> 03:28:27,780
Definitely need that.

3352
03:28:28,760 --> 03:28:30,640
I think there was a bandage in the other room too.

3353
03:28:31,300 --> 03:28:32,380
And I wanna go get it.

3354
03:28:40,490 --> 03:28:42,150
I'm gonna go around the back way.

3355
03:28:48,300 --> 03:28:49,360
There's a...

3356
03:28:49,360 --> 03:28:49,700
Hey.

3357
03:28:51,240 --> 03:28:51,800
Hey.

3358
03:28:52,980 --> 03:28:53,540
Hey.

3359
03:28:57,630 --> 03:29:00,230
There's a lock to open in that tent.

3360
03:29:01,050 --> 03:29:01,950
In which one?

3361
03:29:08,940 --> 03:29:09,200
Hey.

3362
03:29:14,290 --> 03:29:16,190
It was a revolver.

3363
03:29:16,670 --> 03:29:17,390
That's what it was.

3364
03:29:21,270 --> 03:29:22,650
I don't see... wait.

3365
03:29:23,150 --> 03:29:23,770
What did I...

3366
03:29:24,630 --> 03:29:25,750
Something popped up?

3367
03:29:25,830 --> 03:29:26,270
Maybe not.

3368
03:29:26,730 --> 03:29:27,770
Oh no, the shipment report.

3369
03:29:27,870 --> 03:29:28,150
That's it.

3370
03:29:32,860 --> 03:29:33,460
No!

3371
03:29:33,460 --> 03:29:34,060
No!

3372
03:29:34,380 --> 03:29:34,760
No!

3373
03:29:35,160 --> 03:29:35,460
No!

3374
03:29:37,760 --> 03:29:38,500
Mamma mia.

3375
03:29:38,720 --> 03:29:39,620
I could eat a cow.

3376
03:29:41,100 --> 03:29:42,540
He said the thing.

3377
03:29:44,020 --> 03:29:44,960
He said it.

3378
03:29:45,020 --> 03:29:45,780
Mamma mia.

3379
03:29:50,160 --> 03:29:51,740
He said the thing.

3380
03:29:52,400 --> 03:29:55,020
Let me check in here one more time if there's a locker that I missed.

3381
03:29:55,660 --> 03:29:56,360
A lock to pick?

3382
03:29:57,720 --> 03:29:58,860
Doesn't show me anything.

3383
03:29:59,340 --> 03:30:00,100
I guess we're fine.

3384
03:30:04,140 --> 03:30:07,160
Oh, I could have snuck in here at any time.

3385
03:30:07,780 --> 03:30:08,960
That's a little scary.

3386
03:30:10,000 --> 03:30:11,740
Can you... Oh my gosh.

3387
03:30:12,060 --> 03:30:12,360
Who?

3388
03:30:12,760 --> 03:30:14,080
Who's... How?

3389
03:30:15,100 --> 03:30:18,410
Who's sneak is so... so vast?

3390
03:30:18,920 --> 03:30:19,300
What?

3391
03:30:19,640 --> 03:30:21,240
How would you...

3392
03:30:23,800 --> 03:30:25,040
Oh my god.

3393
03:30:31,880 --> 03:30:32,660
Eat.

3394
03:30:32,660 --> 03:30:32,800
Eat.

3395
03:30:34,760 --> 03:30:35,240
Eat.

3396
03:30:36,700 --> 03:30:37,180
Okay.

3397
03:30:39,020 --> 03:30:40,200
Doesn't the guy come in here?

3398
03:30:41,360 --> 03:30:42,780
And like start walking around.

3399
03:30:44,820 --> 03:30:45,800
We're good for now.

3400
03:30:46,500 --> 03:30:47,600
I'm one of the guys.

3401
03:30:48,020 --> 03:30:50,140
I should be able to take any fruit that I want, right?

3402
03:30:50,760 --> 03:30:51,980
It's not just their fruit.

3403
03:30:52,220 --> 03:30:53,620
It could be my fruit.

3404
03:30:53,980 --> 03:30:54,560
I don't know.

3405
03:31:06,100 --> 03:31:07,320
Who's looking at me?

3406
03:31:08,200 --> 03:31:09,380
Uh oh.

3407
03:31:12,040 --> 03:31:12,360
Huh?

3408
03:31:12,960 --> 03:31:13,440
Oh.

3409
03:31:26,680 --> 03:31:29,840
It's my... It's my money too.

3410
03:31:31,540 --> 03:31:35,500
And I'm sick of acting like it's not my money also.

3411
03:31:36,200 --> 03:31:38,920
Who's money... Who's just leaving their money around then?

3412
03:31:40,320 --> 03:31:42,240
It's my money too.

3413
03:31:44,980 --> 03:31:47,280
I want to take the medicine bottle.

3414
03:31:50,080 --> 03:31:50,800
Alright.

3415
03:31:51,280 --> 03:31:52,600
So we're following...

3416
03:31:54,360 --> 03:31:55,080
This.

3417
03:31:55,380 --> 03:31:55,580
What?

3418
03:31:56,040 --> 03:31:56,620
Wait, huh?

3419
03:31:57,500 --> 03:31:58,220
Oh.

3420
03:31:58,960 --> 03:31:59,680
I'm going up?

3421
03:32:00,740 --> 03:32:01,100
Okay.

3422
03:32:05,020 --> 03:32:06,480
Nobody noticed me.

3423
03:32:12,820 --> 03:32:13,920
Here we go.

3424
03:32:16,420 --> 03:32:16,940
Yeah.

3425
03:32:17,120 --> 03:32:18,280
I don't see their name on it either.

3426
03:32:18,440 --> 03:32:18,720
Exactly.

3427
03:32:23,700 --> 03:32:24,220
Hello.

3428
03:32:26,500 --> 03:32:27,020
Inside.

3429
03:32:28,620 --> 03:32:28,760
Up.

3430
03:32:29,020 --> 03:32:29,240
Up.

3431
03:32:29,640 --> 03:32:30,480
Upsy-daisy.

3432
03:32:37,380 --> 03:32:37,900
Okay.

3433
03:32:38,160 --> 03:32:39,440
Now we make it this time.

3434
03:32:40,120 --> 03:32:42,820
We gotta... We gotta make the jump this time.

3435
03:32:43,540 --> 03:32:44,740
Oh my god.

3436
03:32:45,120 --> 03:32:46,840
Indy, don't scare me like that.

3437
03:32:46,840 --> 03:32:47,140
Please.

3438
03:32:49,640 --> 03:32:50,140
Nice.

3439
03:32:52,200 --> 03:32:53,200
This way.

3440
03:32:59,580 --> 03:32:59,960
What?

3441
03:33:00,160 --> 03:33:01,260
Why am I going this way?

3442
03:33:04,720 --> 03:33:05,440
Here?

3443
03:33:06,140 --> 03:33:06,980
Over here.

3444
03:33:09,800 --> 03:33:10,520
Okay.

3445
03:33:17,220 --> 03:33:18,600
Indy, shut up.

3446
03:33:19,780 --> 03:33:20,760
Why are you so loud?

3447
03:33:29,060 --> 03:33:31,720
I'm gonna keep it open maybe.

3448
03:33:37,530 --> 03:33:38,520
Which way?

3449
03:33:39,760 --> 03:33:41,460
It's like right in there.

3450
03:33:41,600 --> 03:33:41,780
Okay.

3451
03:33:41,780 --> 03:33:41,860
Okay.

3452
03:33:41,900 --> 03:33:42,120
Okay.

3453
03:33:44,060 --> 03:33:44,660
Okay.

3454
03:33:50,330 --> 03:33:51,310
There we go.

3455
03:33:51,590 --> 03:33:51,910
Alright.

3456
03:33:52,050 --> 03:33:52,330
Perfect.

3457
03:33:52,950 --> 03:33:53,170
Hello!

3458
03:33:53,570 --> 03:33:54,150
Excuse me.

3459
03:33:55,950 --> 03:33:56,830
Clerical key.

3460
03:33:57,510 --> 03:34:02,430
Do I need to be a priest to go in there?

3461
03:34:05,730 --> 03:34:06,850
Quick change!

3462
03:34:07,530 --> 03:34:07,990
Wow!

3463
03:34:10,290 --> 03:34:10,890
Okay.

3464
03:34:11,010 --> 03:34:11,430
Nice.

3465
03:34:11,430 --> 03:34:14,370
Where is that delivery boy?

3466
03:34:14,970 --> 03:34:15,230
Hello.

3467
03:34:19,960 --> 03:34:23,800
I'm gonna eat more cheese bites.

3468
03:34:24,700 --> 03:34:28,400
I'm a delivery man.

3469
03:34:28,540 --> 03:34:29,100
But I'm gonna mute.

3470
03:35:08,400 --> 03:35:09,480
Okay.

3471
03:35:10,060 --> 03:35:11,980
Why is she looking up?

3472
03:35:14,860 --> 03:35:15,880
I get it now.

3473
03:35:18,500 --> 03:35:20,040
I was like, ma'am?

3474
03:35:20,260 --> 03:35:21,820
I'm right here.

3475
03:35:22,120 --> 03:35:23,120
Oh, I can take a picture of her.

3476
03:35:23,880 --> 03:35:24,700
Sister Catherine.

3477
03:35:37,040 --> 03:35:39,120
Did you say that to me?

3478
03:35:39,840 --> 03:35:40,040
What?

3479
03:35:41,740 --> 03:35:43,420
Who said that?

3480
03:35:44,860 --> 03:35:45,600
Oh, you!

3481
03:35:45,840 --> 03:35:47,180
Oh my God, you scared me.

3482
03:35:47,500 --> 03:35:52,860
Oh my God!

3483
03:36:02,900 --> 03:36:04,260
Cat mummy.

3484
03:36:13,100 --> 03:36:13,520
Hmm.

3485
03:36:37,840 --> 03:36:39,720
Did she just roll her eyes at me?

3486
03:36:40,580 --> 03:36:40,860
Ma'am?

3487
03:36:45,050 --> 03:36:45,990
She's going ghost.

3488
03:36:48,250 --> 03:36:48,610
Gina!

3489
03:36:49,830 --> 03:36:51,410
Gina is a figment of my imagination.

3490
03:36:52,110 --> 03:36:53,310
Gina, I won't let you leave.

3491
03:36:53,750 --> 03:36:55,010
Gina, I won't let you leave me, girl.

3492
03:36:59,070 --> 03:36:59,430
Gina!

3493
03:36:59,430 --> 03:36:59,790
Gina!

3494
03:37:01,990 --> 03:37:02,730
There she goes.

3495
03:37:02,790 --> 03:37:02,890
Oh!

3496
03:37:04,370 --> 03:37:05,350
I'm such a gentleman.

3497
03:37:05,350 --> 03:37:05,750
I'm such a gentleman.

3498
03:37:12,350 --> 03:37:13,190
Yes.

3499
03:37:19,190 --> 03:37:22,530
I love America.

3500
03:37:24,670 --> 03:37:26,030
This isn't...

3501
03:37:35,350 --> 03:37:37,990
All right, let's get this over with.

3502
03:37:41,150 --> 03:37:43,610
Oh no, she's crying.

3503
03:37:46,690 --> 03:37:47,570
What?

3504
03:38:05,350 --> 03:38:07,570
Jesus Christ, what have you done?

3505
03:38:22,320 --> 03:38:23,700
It's occupied.

3506
03:38:31,820 --> 03:38:34,900
That was the most indie thing ever.

3507
03:38:35,420 --> 03:38:36,020
No way!

3508
03:38:36,180 --> 03:38:37,240
Mother-in-law's letter.

3509
03:38:37,240 --> 03:38:41,900
My dear Vittorio, my heart is full of mixed emotions.

3510
03:38:42,500 --> 03:38:46,260
There is a matter of great importance I must share with you and Inez.

3511
03:38:47,340 --> 03:38:48,460
I am with child.

3512
03:38:48,820 --> 03:38:50,120
I know this is unexpected.

3513
03:38:50,440 --> 03:38:53,840
But in my eyes, it is a blessing that fills me with immense happiness.

3514
03:38:54,340 --> 03:39:00,080
It is true that the circumstances surrounding this are complicated, unconventional, and will surely raise many eyebrows.

3515
03:39:00,320 --> 03:39:03,740
But I believe we must face this together with open hearts and minds.

3516
03:39:04,180 --> 03:39:05,440
Love, Adriana.

3517
03:39:06,440 --> 03:39:08,800
This guy is in trouble, all right.

3518
03:39:20,560 --> 03:39:22,840
Follow Gina to the museum.

3519
03:39:25,480 --> 03:39:26,880
But also...

3520
03:39:28,150 --> 03:39:30,340
We have to get the mad priest.

3521
03:39:30,340 --> 03:39:36,060
Which is... go to get that kid.

3522
03:39:43,600 --> 03:39:47,880
Wow, that was messy.

3523
03:39:51,860 --> 03:39:55,460
Oh my God, four question marks!

3524
03:39:55,460 --> 03:39:57,880
Four question marks!

3525
03:39:58,820 --> 03:40:04,240
A little off topic, wanna say you're a legendary menace for suggesting last cup of coffee?

3526
03:40:05,280 --> 03:40:06,920
I wouldn't say menace.

3527
03:40:08,200 --> 03:40:10,380
You got Doki's back and we got your back, boss.

3528
03:40:10,960 --> 03:40:11,600
Thank you.

3529
03:40:13,640 --> 03:40:16,460
I wouldn't say menace.

3530
03:40:19,800 --> 03:40:21,240
Good type of menace.

3531
03:40:24,140 --> 03:40:24,840
Oh,

3532
03:40:28,020 --> 03:40:28,840
nice one.

3533
03:40:29,940 --> 03:40:31,460
The flying machine.

3534
03:40:43,640 --> 03:40:50,120
I love the... I love the way people look at me in this game.

3535
03:40:55,100 --> 03:40:57,520
They look so upset.

3536
03:41:03,680 --> 03:41:06,420
The menace was singing that and then giving two weeks notice.

3537
03:41:07,380 --> 03:41:09,240
This is Antonio, right?

3538
03:41:10,980 --> 03:41:13,680
Oh, wait, Antonio is our friend.

3539
03:41:17,560 --> 03:41:17,760
Hello.

3540
03:41:24,920 --> 03:41:25,280
Okay.

3541
03:41:28,780 --> 03:41:30,680
That's Sydney, you're right.

3542
03:41:35,360 --> 03:41:37,180
Who is this guy?

3543
03:41:40,820 --> 03:41:41,740
Also, look!

3544
03:41:42,140 --> 03:41:42,640
My photos!

3545
03:41:46,180 --> 03:41:48,260
Why... I thought I got way more.

3546
03:41:55,310 --> 03:41:56,030
Awkward.

3547
03:41:56,030 --> 03:41:56,290
Awkward.

3548
03:41:56,990 --> 03:42:00,830
I thought I took way more photos of these things than just four of them.

3549
03:42:02,630 --> 03:42:03,970
Why aren't they hung up?

3550
03:42:05,030 --> 03:42:05,350
Hello.

3551
03:42:07,330 --> 03:42:07,770
Antonio.

3552
03:42:09,710 --> 03:42:11,410
You're my Italian streamer now.

3553
03:42:15,130 --> 03:42:16,770
Oh, I guess I didn't give them to him, maybe.

3554
03:42:30,590 --> 03:42:31,270
What?

3555
03:42:39,390 --> 03:42:40,070
What?

3556
03:42:48,130 --> 03:42:51,290
What if the giant we saw was a baby giant?

3557
03:42:53,370 --> 03:42:55,310
What if there is actually a huge giant?

3558
03:42:57,770 --> 03:42:58,670
Oh, okay, good.

3559
03:42:58,710 --> 03:43:00,110
We have to go over there.

3560
03:43:07,070 --> 03:43:12,470
Wait, that's the key, the sewer key that we needed earlier.

3561
03:43:13,570 --> 03:43:13,990
Nice.

3562
03:43:15,230 --> 03:43:16,630
That's an oxymoron.

3563
03:43:16,710 --> 03:43:17,810
How is that an oxymoron?

3564
03:43:18,150 --> 03:43:20,250
Giants have to be babies at some point too.

3565
03:43:20,250 --> 03:43:21,230
Right?

3566
03:43:23,730 --> 03:43:24,450
Ventura's letter.

3567
03:43:30,070 --> 03:43:30,910
Wait, did he just teleport?

3568
03:43:43,090 --> 03:43:43,610
For

3569
03:43:47,280 --> 03:43:48,920
those who don't know...

3570
03:43:49,560 --> 03:43:54,100
Game glitches are some of my favorite things ever, ever, ever to watch in the world.

3571
03:43:54,220 --> 03:43:58,600
Like, I love watching compilations of Red Dead Redemption glitches.

3572
03:43:58,940 --> 03:44:03,920
Just any type of game, especially ones that are like AAA titles that just have like...

3573
03:44:06,040 --> 03:44:09,280
Game glitches that are just so ridiculous.

3574
03:44:09,760 --> 03:44:11,360
They're so funny.

3575
03:44:14,640 --> 03:44:15,660
I love them.

3576
03:44:16,620 --> 03:44:20,560
So when stuff like that happens, I know some people get upset about it.

3577
03:44:20,600 --> 03:44:21,440
They're like, my version.

3578
03:44:22,700 --> 03:44:24,240
Skyrim has the best glitch IMO?

3579
03:44:24,420 --> 03:44:25,180
What else?

3580
03:44:25,740 --> 03:44:27,640
I don't know if I've ever watched Skyrim once.

3581
03:44:30,080 --> 03:44:31,620
It's always AAA games too.

3582
03:44:31,740 --> 03:44:32,040
I know!

3583
03:44:32,240 --> 03:44:38,080
I know some people get upset because you pay so much money for it to be glitchy and silly.

3584
03:44:38,440 --> 03:44:40,400
But I just eat it up.

3585
03:44:40,520 --> 03:44:41,580
I'm like...

3586
03:44:41,580 --> 03:44:42,820
Gosh, I love it!

3587
03:44:42,880 --> 03:44:43,740
It's so great!

3588
03:44:46,300 --> 03:44:49,360
Antonio, these black shirts are operating under my authority.

3589
03:44:49,680 --> 03:44:52,960
And you will not hinder them in gathering suspected contraband books for inspection.

3590
03:44:53,920 --> 03:44:59,620
If you threaten to beat them about the head with a crucifix again, you will have me to answer to.

3591
03:44:59,860 --> 03:45:01,460
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

3592
03:45:01,860 --> 03:45:03,100
Father Cesar Ventura.

3593
03:45:11,420 --> 03:45:13,040
You see that on the phone?

3594
03:45:15,860 --> 03:45:17,360
This guy is heavy breathing.

3595
03:45:17,520 --> 03:45:19,360
Hey, I have more photos to give you.

3596
03:45:27,840 --> 03:45:31,400
Oh, you want me to do it myself?

3597
03:45:39,050 --> 03:45:41,550
I've taken way more than just four!

3598
03:45:42,950 --> 03:45:44,170
This is ridiculous!

3599
03:45:45,690 --> 03:45:48,330
I've taken way more than just four of them.

3600
03:45:48,430 --> 03:45:49,570
I'm so confused.

3601
03:45:54,820 --> 03:45:56,340
Are they in the bag?

3602
03:45:56,920 --> 03:46:00,460
I don't think so.

3603
03:46:05,520 --> 03:46:07,380
No, they're not.

3604
03:46:10,760 --> 03:46:12,240
You can check your journal.

3605
03:46:16,570 --> 03:46:17,050
Hmm...

3606
03:46:21,170 --> 03:46:22,290
I don't know.

3607
03:46:27,550 --> 03:46:32,790
So I have to find all the rest of them for them to go on the board at once?

3608
03:46:33,530 --> 03:46:34,290
Is that how it works?

3609
03:46:35,390 --> 03:46:36,910
Go to Secret of the Giants.

3610
03:46:38,710 --> 03:46:40,450
See, I've gotten 8 out of 10!

3611
03:46:43,050 --> 03:46:44,790
I've gotten 8 out of 10 of them.

3612
03:46:45,310 --> 03:46:46,490
So I'm close.

3613
03:46:46,570 --> 03:46:48,810
I was like, there's no way that I've only found 4.

3614
03:46:48,910 --> 03:46:49,490
That's ridiculous.

3615
03:46:53,370 --> 03:46:54,870
You have to give them the rest to fill the board.

3616
03:46:55,010 --> 03:46:56,290
Ah, okay, okay, okay, okay.

3617
03:46:56,450 --> 03:46:58,210
I thought he meant like, put them up yourself.

3618
03:46:59,370 --> 03:47:00,270
Okay, okay.

3619
03:47:00,690 --> 03:47:02,050
So we'll do that.

3620
03:47:07,410 --> 03:47:07,770
But...

3621
03:47:08,310 --> 03:47:09,910
We also have this.

3622
03:47:10,090 --> 03:47:12,390
Get to the... I don't want to go to the sewers.

3623
03:47:12,390 --> 03:47:14,330
I thought I was going here.

3624
03:47:19,900 --> 03:47:20,840
Hold on.

3625
03:47:26,180 --> 03:47:28,060
Let's follow Gina first.

3626
03:47:28,760 --> 03:47:29,280
I don't know.

3627
03:47:30,560 --> 03:47:31,760
If I miss some...

3628
03:47:32,160 --> 03:47:36,620
I want to say also, if I miss some of these other missions...

3629
03:47:37,560 --> 03:47:38,820
I'm not intending on...

3630
03:47:40,600 --> 03:47:44,480
100%ing anything or the game or anything like that, so...

3631
03:47:44,480 --> 03:47:45,780
If I miss some, that's okay.

3632
03:47:45,780 --> 03:47:47,820
Whoa, what happened to the quality all of a sudden?

3633
03:47:49,060 --> 03:47:51,380
Wow, you can even see it up from here!

3634
03:47:51,520 --> 03:47:52,780
Wow, that's cool.

3635
03:47:58,800 --> 03:48:01,300
This game takes quite a bit to 100%.

3636
03:48:01,300 --> 03:48:02,020
Yeah.

3637
03:48:03,120 --> 03:48:03,780
I imagine.

3638
03:48:03,920 --> 03:48:05,160
I figured it would be like that.

3639
03:48:07,400 --> 03:48:08,460
Looks like it's syncing.

3640
03:48:09,520 --> 03:48:11,660
Why did the quality get so bad all of a sudden?

3641
03:48:12,080 --> 03:48:14,860
I think the quality...

3642
03:48:14,860 --> 03:48:18,240
from when I played on PC...

3643
03:48:18,240 --> 03:48:20,600
also transferred over to the Xbox.

3644
03:48:20,900 --> 03:48:23,360
So, honestly, I just didn't change them.

3645
03:48:24,700 --> 03:48:26,920
So, it probably could look much better.

3646
03:48:27,200 --> 03:48:28,860
And I'm, you know...

3647
03:48:30,120 --> 03:48:31,860
denying us all that.

3648
03:48:32,140 --> 03:48:32,580
Hello?

3649
03:48:33,240 --> 03:48:35,160
Why are you climbing up on top of a bucket?

3650
03:48:35,620 --> 03:48:35,940
Indy!

3651
03:48:47,530 --> 03:48:48,090
Here.

3652
03:48:48,090 --> 03:48:49,950
I can never remember the pathway.

3653
03:48:54,140 --> 03:48:56,440
Some light bugs on the Xbox version.

3654
03:48:56,620 --> 03:48:57,500
Ah, it is there.

3655
03:49:01,570 --> 03:49:02,690
I don't...

3656
03:49:02,690 --> 03:49:04,290
Let's do Gina's thing first.

3657
03:49:04,570 --> 03:49:06,990
Okay, I'm trying not to get seen and I'm gonna change.

3658
03:49:13,890 --> 03:49:14,450
Nice.

3659
03:49:16,150 --> 03:49:16,710
Okay.

3660
03:49:19,770 --> 03:49:21,210
Um, excuse me?

3661
03:49:22,050 --> 03:49:22,610
Sir?

3662
03:49:23,610 --> 03:49:24,150
Wait.

3663
03:49:35,330 --> 03:49:36,430
Actually, this works.

3664
03:49:36,710 --> 03:49:37,210
This is fine.

3665
03:49:37,730 --> 03:49:38,610
This is fine, everybody.

3666
03:49:39,410 --> 03:49:40,150
This is fine.

3667
03:49:40,250 --> 03:49:41,470
They knew...

3668
03:49:41,470 --> 03:49:42,450
people would do this.

3669
03:49:54,340 --> 03:49:56,390
Sean, thanks for 8 months.

3670
03:49:56,410 --> 03:49:57,430
Thank you!

3671
03:50:00,810 --> 03:50:02,150
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

3672
03:50:08,030 --> 03:50:10,110
Oh, I thought they covered it.

3673
03:50:10,170 --> 03:50:11,710
I was gonna be like, no way!

3674
03:50:16,580 --> 03:50:17,360
It's in here, right?

3675
03:50:19,120 --> 03:50:19,580
Yeah.

3676
03:50:20,860 --> 03:50:21,320
Hello.

3677
03:50:22,400 --> 03:50:22,960
Excuse me.

3678
03:50:25,540 --> 03:50:26,420
I can't believe it.

3679
03:50:27,800 --> 03:50:28,260
Wow.

3680
03:50:31,860 --> 03:50:34,860
They love that statue so much, they made the same guy twice.

3681
03:50:35,400 --> 03:50:38,100
You ever just think about how bored people were back in like...

3682
03:50:39,100 --> 03:50:41,180
You know, the ancient days.

3683
03:50:41,480 --> 03:50:44,960
Where they're like, I'm gonna make the most detailed statue ever.

3684
03:50:47,480 --> 03:50:48,800
It's how I look, IRL.

3685
03:50:49,000 --> 03:50:49,580
I believe you.

3686
03:50:58,410 --> 03:51:00,650
Like, to make the same statue identical.

3687
03:51:02,290 --> 03:51:02,670
What the?

3688
03:51:02,770 --> 03:51:03,230
Oh my god.

3689
03:51:06,640 --> 03:51:08,380
No access, huh?

3690
03:51:09,180 --> 03:51:09,880
Well, I'm...

3691
03:51:13,780 --> 03:51:16,340
I always forget what...

3692
03:51:16,340 --> 03:51:17,900
No, no, no!

3693
03:51:18,080 --> 03:51:18,400
Please!

3694
03:51:20,280 --> 03:51:21,060
There we go.

3695
03:51:21,640 --> 03:51:23,100
Thank you.

3696
03:51:24,260 --> 03:51:25,920
They 3D printed it?

3697
03:51:28,860 --> 03:51:30,480
It's... yeah, probably.

3698
03:51:30,480 --> 03:51:30,560
Probably.

3699
03:51:33,760 --> 03:51:36,480
But I can go in.

3700
03:51:41,200 --> 03:51:43,020
Can't even trust nuns these days?

3701
03:51:43,760 --> 03:51:46,100
Why do you think so many of the old statues are naked?

3702
03:51:46,480 --> 03:51:47,380
They're just bored.

3703
03:51:48,340 --> 03:51:50,600
They're like, man, I...

3704
03:51:51,320 --> 03:51:53,660
Would really love to look at...

3705
03:51:54,880 --> 03:51:56,660
Something sexy right now.

3706
03:51:56,660 --> 03:51:56,680
I don't know.

3707
03:52:00,820 --> 03:52:04,200
I don't know who perceived me, but someone did.

3708
03:52:05,040 --> 03:52:06,160
I'm looking around a little bit.

3709
03:52:06,320 --> 03:52:08,460
I wanna loot if I can.

3710
03:52:10,540 --> 03:52:11,360
Up there.

3711
03:52:11,620 --> 03:52:11,780
Okay.

3712
03:52:13,200 --> 03:52:14,940
Oh, there's a little tent.

3713
03:52:15,880 --> 03:52:16,840
I shall go in.

3714
03:52:18,300 --> 03:52:18,820
Wait.

3715
03:52:19,460 --> 03:52:20,660
You're not the guy I need to worry about.

3716
03:52:21,240 --> 03:52:21,700
Ciao!

3717
03:52:23,080 --> 03:52:23,600
Ciao!

3718
03:52:25,880 --> 03:52:26,800
Mystery note.

3719
03:52:27,960 --> 03:52:29,740
Oh, the secret delivery letter.

3720
03:52:30,280 --> 03:52:30,900
Okay, there's a lot.

3721
03:52:31,240 --> 03:52:32,340
Shipment from first zone.

3722
03:52:32,460 --> 03:52:33,600
Your eyes only.

3723
03:52:34,040 --> 03:52:35,500
Code key dice.

3724
03:52:37,300 --> 03:52:38,780
Someone has written a note at the bottom.

3725
03:52:38,940 --> 03:52:39,780
The code must be wrong.

3726
03:52:39,940 --> 03:52:40,820
Shipment arrived on Wednesday.

3727
03:52:41,120 --> 03:52:42,260
Should be 4718.

3728
03:52:42,540 --> 03:52:43,040
No luck.

3729
03:52:43,520 --> 03:52:45,160
Get engineer to look into it.

3730
03:52:46,600 --> 03:52:47,080
4718.

3731
03:52:54,740 --> 03:52:57,600
There's a note on October 20th.

3732
03:52:59,220 --> 03:53:00,040
Code look up table.

3733
03:53:01,340 --> 03:53:01,820
Confidential.

3734
03:53:01,920 --> 03:53:02,700
Memorize and destroy.

3735
03:53:02,940 --> 03:53:05,020
The numbers... Oh, someone didn't do that.

3736
03:53:06,060 --> 03:53:10,120
The numbers for the letters C, D, E and I are circled in the column for Wednesday.

3737
03:53:13,800 --> 03:53:15,020
We'll just take that, dude.

3738
03:53:17,460 --> 03:53:18,720
Oh my god!

3739
03:53:20,900 --> 03:53:21,980
Are you asleep?

3740
03:53:22,600 --> 03:53:23,860
Oh, he's asleep.

3741
03:53:27,840 --> 03:53:30,640
I always get my camera out first on accident.

3742
03:53:35,450 --> 03:53:37,530
I think that's the guy that didn't do his job.

3743
03:53:39,410 --> 03:53:40,910
I thank you, sir.

3744
03:53:42,070 --> 03:53:44,310
And I will thank you... Oh, that looks important.

3745
03:53:45,070 --> 03:53:48,150
I'll thank you by not waking you up.

3746
03:53:48,290 --> 03:53:51,370
It was

3747
03:53:56,290 --> 03:53:57,530
4718, right?

3748
03:54:07,930 --> 03:54:08,450
4718.

3749
03:54:10,390 --> 03:54:12,470
He said it should be 4718.

3750
03:54:12,670 --> 03:54:12,930
Hold on.

3751
03:54:13,710 --> 03:54:15,390
Oh, and we got some bread.

3752
03:54:17,230 --> 03:54:18,490
Do this every time.

3753
03:54:22,150 --> 03:54:23,530
Chomp, chomp, chomp.

3754
03:54:24,090 --> 03:54:24,610
Biscotti.

3755
03:54:30,010 --> 03:54:31,670
Let me check my notes.

3756
03:54:33,770 --> 03:54:37,730
How do I... Where do I find it, anyway?

3757
03:54:41,690 --> 03:54:44,070
It said it was everything but that.

3758
03:54:44,810 --> 03:54:45,010
No!

3759
03:54:45,690 --> 03:54:46,410
Field notes?

3760
03:54:54,680 --> 03:54:57,640
Field notes... Oh, thank you.

3761
03:55:00,160 --> 03:55:02,120
Oh, goodness.

3762
03:55:06,700 --> 03:55:08,200
Fungi recipe!

3763
03:55:12,560 --> 03:55:13,820
Where the hell is it?

3764
03:55:20,620 --> 03:55:21,780
Hold on.

3765
03:55:24,000 --> 03:55:25,540
Hold on.

3766
03:55:27,480 --> 03:55:28,600
Hold.

3767
03:55:28,820 --> 03:55:29,240
Hold!

3768
03:55:29,240 --> 03:55:29,440
Hold!

3769
03:55:30,260 --> 03:55:31,420
Hold!

3770
03:55:33,380 --> 03:55:34,540
No.

3771
03:55:35,720 --> 03:55:36,200
Hold!

3772
03:55:39,680 --> 03:55:41,060
Brown cat.

3773
03:55:52,590 --> 03:55:54,190
Black and white cat.

3774
03:55:55,770 --> 03:55:56,930
Guys,

3775
03:56:09,660 --> 03:56:10,640
I can't find it.

3776
03:56:14,180 --> 03:56:15,360
Oh, it's mysteries.

3777
03:56:19,650 --> 03:56:20,470
Thank you.

3778
03:56:20,470 --> 03:56:23,490
Thank you.

3779
03:56:41,230 --> 03:56:42,110
Wednesday.

3780
03:56:42,550 --> 03:56:42,730
Okay.

3781
03:56:43,330 --> 03:56:44,730
So, dice.

3782
03:56:48,830 --> 03:56:49,710
D...

3783
03:56:50,330 --> 03:56:52,330
So, dice...

3784
03:56:52,930 --> 03:56:54,210
And it'd be Wednesday.

3785
03:56:56,110 --> 03:56:56,850
Okay, hold on.

3786
03:57:00,030 --> 03:57:01,410
Wednesday is mare.

3787
03:57:02,290 --> 03:57:03,190
The ones that are circled.

3788
03:57:05,870 --> 03:57:06,470
D...

3789
03:57:06,470 --> 03:57:07,190
D... 4...

3790
03:57:09,710 --> 03:57:10,910
I... 7...

3791
03:57:20,120 --> 03:57:20,720
4...

3792
03:57:20,720 --> 03:57:21,840
Okay, Indy, please.

3793
03:57:22,280 --> 03:57:22,640
Hold on.

3794
03:57:25,360 --> 03:57:25,960
4...

3795
03:57:26,760 --> 03:57:27,360
See?

3796
03:57:27,620 --> 03:57:29,220
Yeah, dice is circled.

3797
03:57:30,100 --> 03:57:30,700
4...

3798
03:57:30,700 --> 03:57:31,780
I...

3799
03:57:33,920 --> 03:57:35,120
4... 7...

3800
03:57:35,120 --> 03:57:35,860
Oh, wait.

3801
03:57:36,080 --> 03:57:37,380
That's the same thing that we tried.

3802
03:57:40,200 --> 03:57:41,280
I'm stupid.

3803
03:57:45,340 --> 03:57:46,780
I'm silly.

3804
03:57:50,690 --> 03:57:52,030
Okay, hold on.

3805
03:57:55,670 --> 03:57:57,150
Shipment arrived on Wednesday.

3806
03:58:00,490 --> 03:58:02,410
And that's when... that's...

3807
03:58:02,410 --> 03:58:03,370
What we have written.

3808
03:58:03,970 --> 03:58:04,770
Should be 4718.

3809
03:58:04,890 --> 03:58:05,310
No luck.

3810
03:58:06,510 --> 03:58:07,530
Get an engineer...

3811
03:58:08,890 --> 03:58:11,490
You're just dealing with the same problem they had.

3812
03:58:12,810 --> 03:58:13,330
Right?

3813
03:58:20,280 --> 03:58:22,360
This is the shipment container, right?

3814
03:58:28,340 --> 03:58:30,500
I only have 3 out of 4 notes though.

3815
03:58:30,540 --> 03:58:31,160
I'm missing one.

3816
03:58:43,210 --> 03:58:44,730
Oh, the fourth note is in the chest.

3817
03:58:47,410 --> 03:58:48,210
Let's see.

3818
03:58:49,630 --> 03:58:50,670
October 15th.

3819
03:58:56,070 --> 03:58:56,590
But...

3820
03:59:11,730 --> 03:59:12,450
Then...

3821
03:59:12,450 --> 03:59:14,810
Would be...

3822
03:59:14,810 --> 03:59:16,170
6...

3823
03:59:17,370 --> 03:59:18,090
3...

3824
03:59:19,550 --> 03:59:20,630
6... 3...

3825
03:59:23,130 --> 03:59:27,470
8... 0...

3826
03:59:28,730 --> 03:59:29,450
Right?

3827
03:59:52,320 --> 03:59:53,560
Oh my god!

3828
03:59:53,860 --> 03:59:54,840
Only 10 euros!

3829
03:59:58,060 --> 03:59:59,220
Mystery note.

3830
03:59:59,400 --> 04:00:00,000
Wait, hold on.

3831
04:00:00,160 --> 04:00:01,420
Let's grab the medicine.

3832
04:00:01,420 --> 04:00:03,700
Medicine bottles?

3833
04:00:04,420 --> 04:00:05,920
That's huge!

3834
04:00:07,140 --> 04:00:08,880
It's a map guide.

3835
04:00:11,840 --> 04:00:13,400
I thought I said apologies.

3836
04:00:16,480 --> 04:00:17,800
Mario!

3837
04:00:24,440 --> 04:00:27,400
Is that Duce?

3838
04:00:31,500 --> 04:00:33,000
The people loved it.

3839
04:00:36,180 --> 04:00:38,700
Glad you had fun Raccoon!

3840
04:00:52,640 --> 04:00:53,320
Fertility?

3841
04:00:59,310 --> 04:01:01,030
Does not drink of course.

3842
04:01:05,090 --> 04:01:09,370
Who I'm sure would find this a fitting souvenir of his visit to Italy.

3843
04:01:09,690 --> 04:01:12,110
Do not forget to ensure that the gift is presented on my behalf.

3844
04:01:12,450 --> 04:01:14,170
A favor is repaid with a favor, son.

3845
04:01:19,250 --> 04:01:21,670
I enclosed some leisure money for you in the crate.

3846
04:01:21,810 --> 04:01:22,510
Spend it wisely.

3847
04:01:30,790 --> 04:01:31,230
Completed!

3848
04:01:31,230 --> 04:01:31,390
Medicine!

3849
04:01:32,030 --> 04:01:36,610
We did it!

3850
04:01:36,750 --> 04:01:40,650
One thing I wanted to do too was...

3851
04:01:41,230 --> 04:01:42,810
We got fruit bag.

3852
04:01:44,770 --> 04:01:45,950
It's kind of expensive.

3853
04:01:46,950 --> 04:01:48,330
We also got Vatican medicine.

3854
04:01:48,910 --> 04:01:50,610
You don't even need...

3855
04:01:50,610 --> 04:01:51,670
You can just inspect...

3856
04:01:51,670 --> 04:01:52,270
Nevermind.

3857
04:01:52,990 --> 04:01:54,130
You can't just use it.

3858
04:01:54,370 --> 04:01:55,070
Just kidding.

3859
04:02:02,870 --> 04:02:04,890
What is splinter smash again?

3860
04:02:05,030 --> 04:02:07,810
The last hit before an improvised weapon break deals additional damage.

3861
04:02:09,830 --> 04:02:10,770
It's in my journal.

3862
04:02:11,410 --> 04:02:12,970
Gosh, this stuff says so much.

3863
04:02:15,010 --> 04:02:15,810
There it is.

3864
04:02:21,030 --> 04:02:24,170
I drove 13 hours to attend the concert!

3865
04:02:24,570 --> 04:02:25,450
It was absolutely worth it.

3866
04:02:25,550 --> 04:02:26,870
You did a phenomenal job.

3867
04:02:27,150 --> 04:02:28,510
Can't wait to see you perform again in the future.

3868
04:02:28,510 --> 04:02:29,610
Thanks, Telegram!

3869
04:02:29,850 --> 04:02:31,050
Didn't you give me a letter?

3870
04:02:34,010 --> 04:02:35,830
I got it.

3871
04:02:37,230 --> 04:02:38,110
Thank you!

3872
04:02:38,230 --> 04:02:39,250
13 hours though.

3873
04:02:39,470 --> 04:02:40,310
Maybe I did.

3874
04:02:40,690 --> 04:02:42,090
Maybe I received it.

3875
04:02:44,130 --> 04:02:45,110
Thank you!

3876
04:02:48,920 --> 04:02:49,480
Cool.

3877
04:02:50,700 --> 04:02:51,660
Investigate the fountain.

3878
04:02:52,000 --> 04:02:53,020
Wait, look at that!

3879
04:02:53,200 --> 04:02:54,360
Oh no, we shouldn't...

3880
04:02:54,360 --> 04:02:56,780
They said to take care of everything in the Vatican...

3881
04:02:56,780 --> 04:02:59,080
Before we investigate this fountain.

3882
04:02:59,080 --> 04:03:00,760
But we know where the fountain is.

3883
04:03:01,120 --> 04:03:02,060
Which is good.

3884
04:03:04,900 --> 04:03:05,740
I'm coming.

3885
04:03:06,200 --> 04:03:06,500
Hello.

3886
04:03:18,500 --> 04:03:19,120
Hello?

3887
04:03:19,560 --> 04:03:20,520
Ma'am, please.

3888
04:03:20,920 --> 04:03:21,280
Ma'am?

3889
04:03:21,560 --> 04:03:22,300
What are you doing?

3890
04:03:23,160 --> 04:03:24,280
Where are you going?

3891
04:03:25,580 --> 04:03:26,180
Ma'am?

3892
04:03:27,660 --> 04:03:30,020
I don't think the staff... I don't think it's over there.

3893
04:03:30,560 --> 04:03:31,260
What is she doing?

3894
04:03:33,120 --> 04:03:34,800
I don't think it's over there.

3895
04:03:37,220 --> 04:03:39,380
Drops the large evil anvil on the ghost's head.

3896
04:03:39,440 --> 04:03:39,700
Why?

3897
04:03:44,970 --> 04:03:45,390
Locked.

3898
04:04:00,310 --> 04:04:01,850
Oh my God, I took that one too.

3899
04:04:03,730 --> 04:04:04,910
Excuse me.

3900
04:04:07,310 --> 04:04:10,470
I guess we... I know this is a restricted area, but are we safe?

3901
04:04:10,850 --> 04:04:12,690
Why is she running like this?

3902
04:04:13,210 --> 04:04:13,750
Ma'am?

3903
04:04:19,550 --> 04:04:21,290
Don't just stand there!

3904
04:04:39,740 --> 04:04:46,940
Oh no!

3905
04:04:50,410 --> 04:04:50,630
No!

3906
04:04:56,010 --> 04:04:59,650
No one heard that though, right?

3907
04:05:01,410 --> 04:05:04,710
She was... She was so awesome.

3908
04:05:07,130 --> 04:05:08,270
Ok.

3909
04:05:08,270 --> 04:05:08,390
Ok.

3910
04:05:10,530 --> 04:05:12,790
I should take his outfit, you know?

3911
04:05:14,090 --> 04:05:14,510
Oh wow.

3912
04:05:18,540 --> 04:05:19,260
Where?

3913
04:05:20,160 --> 04:05:21,380
Oh, no?

3914
04:05:21,900 --> 04:05:22,260
This?

3915
04:05:22,980 --> 04:05:24,240
Roman murals.

3916
04:05:28,920 --> 04:05:29,400
Duh.

3917
04:05:29,620 --> 04:05:30,900
Roman, duh.

3918
04:05:31,780 --> 04:05:33,180
We're supposed to do it together.

3919
04:05:34,720 --> 04:05:36,260
It's... Why is she leaping?

3920
04:05:44,140 --> 04:05:47,000
Oh my God, you gotta keep...

3921
04:05:47,000 --> 04:05:49,040
You didn't even make it!

3922
04:05:49,420 --> 04:05:51,400
Why did she stand in corners?

3923
04:05:52,580 --> 04:05:53,220
Gina.

3924
04:05:53,680 --> 04:05:56,020
Gina, my girl, Gina.

3925
04:05:56,840 --> 04:05:57,540
Come on.

3926
04:05:58,040 --> 04:05:58,880
Gina, come on!

3927
04:05:59,520 --> 04:06:00,140
Oh there she is.

3928
04:06:00,220 --> 04:06:00,300
Ok.

3929
04:06:00,300 --> 04:06:00,360
Ok.

3930
04:06:16,340 --> 04:06:18,860
And he fights like one too.

3931
04:06:20,400 --> 04:06:21,220
What were you doing?

3932
04:06:21,480 --> 04:06:21,900
Come on.

3933
04:06:25,800 --> 04:06:26,420
No!

3934
04:06:27,120 --> 04:06:27,500
Oh well.

3935
04:06:35,000 --> 04:06:36,060
Come in.

3936
04:06:39,340 --> 04:06:40,680
Like a wet noodle.

3937
04:06:41,240 --> 04:06:41,420
Oh!

3938
04:06:43,640 --> 04:06:44,740
The goat.

3939
04:06:47,860 --> 04:06:48,800
A lot of boobs.

3940
04:06:51,820 --> 04:06:53,940
I was born in the wrong era.

3941
04:06:56,420 --> 04:06:58,640
Gina, I can hide under here.

3942
04:07:00,620 --> 04:07:02,020
I was looking at the animal.

3943
04:07:07,010 --> 04:07:08,230
What are you looking at?

3944
04:07:08,410 --> 04:07:11,130
Oh, that doesn't look very good.

3945
04:07:13,410 --> 04:07:13,970
Handprint.

3946
04:07:18,470 --> 04:07:22,950
I don't think a handprint is not the first thing I thought of.

3947
04:07:26,470 --> 04:07:28,570
From a black shirt's uniform.

3948
04:07:30,850 --> 04:07:31,290
Ok.

3949
04:07:33,130 --> 04:07:33,830
Was this a note?

3950
04:07:34,970 --> 04:07:35,850
Gina's note?

3951
04:07:36,990 --> 04:07:37,930
What kind of hat?

3952
04:07:37,950 --> 04:07:38,730
That's what I'm wondering.

3953
04:07:41,130 --> 04:07:43,270
Giuliana, I want you to investigate something.

3954
04:07:43,470 --> 04:07:46,970
There's a strange American professor here looking for his lost cat mummy.

3955
04:07:47,430 --> 04:07:49,470
He tells me that he is from Marshall College in Connecticut.

3956
04:07:49,890 --> 04:07:52,630
Maybe you can check with your contact in the Vatican Secret Agency.

3957
04:07:52,970 --> 04:07:53,230
Gina.

3958
04:07:53,230 --> 04:07:56,490
I wonder what made her drop it.

3959
04:07:57,070 --> 04:07:57,950
Giuliana.

3960
04:08:01,270 --> 04:08:04,500
Ma'am.

3961
04:08:06,260 --> 04:08:06,520
Oh.

3962
04:08:07,540 --> 04:08:07,980
Ok.

3963
04:08:10,680 --> 04:08:12,520
Ok, ok, ok.

3964
04:08:13,760 --> 04:08:15,780
Oh, I found it.

3965
04:08:17,940 --> 04:08:19,260
Giuliana Franco.

3966
04:08:20,400 --> 04:08:20,660
Wait.

3967
04:08:20,660 --> 04:08:22,040
Oh, wow.

3968
04:08:22,640 --> 04:08:23,720
I'm doxing her?

3969
04:08:23,800 --> 04:08:24,300
I'm so sorry.

3970
04:08:26,140 --> 04:08:28,420
We literally know everything about her now.

3971
04:08:28,860 --> 04:08:30,780
We know her mom.

3972
04:08:32,800 --> 04:08:33,380
Damn.

3973
04:08:41,220 --> 04:08:43,400
I wish I could see anything.

3974
04:08:46,040 --> 04:08:47,680
Why don't you find anything?

3975
04:08:50,660 --> 04:08:51,260
What?

3976
04:08:54,590 --> 04:08:55,800
Oh she did...wow.

3977
04:08:55,920 --> 04:08:57,980
I asked and she found...

3978
04:08:57,980 --> 04:08:58,280
Huh?

3979
04:08:59,040 --> 04:09:01,520
Taken during infiltration of Costello.

3980
04:09:01,840 --> 04:09:02,260
What?

3981
04:09:09,220 --> 04:09:10,200
Wow.

3982
04:09:11,160 --> 04:09:13,140
Ok, now we can go.

3983
04:09:16,820 --> 04:09:17,800
Lockpick.

3984
04:09:19,580 --> 04:09:20,280
Someone...

3985
04:09:20,800 --> 04:09:22,620
How did I not notice that?

3986
04:09:23,600 --> 04:09:24,480
That's kind of freaky.

3987
04:09:28,560 --> 04:09:30,540
What do you mean ex-Gina?

3988
04:09:32,960 --> 04:09:34,400
What does that mean?

3989
04:09:38,820 --> 04:09:39,520
Footprints.

3990
04:09:41,340 --> 04:09:42,140
Oh, sorry.

3991
04:09:43,680 --> 04:09:44,960
I'm a little clumsy.

3992
04:09:44,960 --> 04:09:46,740
Please forgive me, Gina.

3993
04:09:47,760 --> 04:09:49,300
Press X to Gina.

3994
04:09:53,780 --> 04:09:54,540
Ok.

3995
04:09:56,480 --> 04:09:58,240
There's another scuffle here.

3996
04:09:58,980 --> 04:10:01,180
And those footprints look like...none prints.

3997
04:10:02,400 --> 04:10:03,440
None your business.

3998
04:10:04,800 --> 04:10:08,960
Sorry, I didn't...I tried to...

3999
04:10:09,720 --> 04:10:10,540
Let's keep going.

4000
04:10:20,670 --> 04:10:22,070
Huh?

4001
04:10:22,990 --> 04:10:23,490
Blood.

4002
04:10:26,730 --> 04:10:30,330
And there's something shiny here.

4003
04:10:31,230 --> 04:10:31,990
Glitters?

4004
04:10:34,690 --> 04:10:35,070
Oh!

4005
04:10:39,370 --> 04:10:40,070
Oh!

4006
04:10:43,410 --> 04:10:45,090
The murdering nun.

4007
04:10:48,910 --> 04:10:50,910
There's three of them.

4008
04:11:06,220 --> 04:11:08,520
What do you want me to...

4009
04:11:13,220 --> 04:11:14,620
Lady?

4010
04:11:21,020 --> 04:11:22,840
What the hell?

4011
04:11:25,500 --> 04:11:26,960
That lady keeps running off.

4012
04:11:27,020 --> 04:11:28,640
Yeah, it left me.

4013
04:11:31,120 --> 04:11:32,080
This bitch.

4014
04:11:33,360 --> 04:11:34,920
Let's see if there's anything else in here.

4015
04:11:35,760 --> 04:11:37,060
Your friend is in a tower.

4016
04:11:38,100 --> 04:11:39,340
We know where she is now.

4017
04:11:45,570 --> 04:11:46,470
Oh, I missed.

4018
04:11:56,950 --> 04:11:57,750
What's this?

4019
04:11:59,750 --> 04:12:00,950
I need to find a nun.

4020
04:12:03,700 --> 04:12:05,140
Are you talking?

4021
04:12:06,820 --> 04:12:08,140
The plumber.

4022
04:12:09,280 --> 04:12:09,680
Wait.

4023
04:12:10,280 --> 04:12:12,840
Wait, but this...

4024
04:12:12,840 --> 04:12:13,660
You guys!

4025
04:12:14,580 --> 04:12:16,220
What could it be?

4026
04:12:19,260 --> 04:12:20,760
It's really bright in here.

4027
04:12:25,630 --> 04:12:27,830
We went all the way out here.

4028
04:12:29,310 --> 04:12:30,530
There you go.

4029
04:12:30,530 --> 04:12:31,250
Oh!

4030
04:12:46,550 --> 04:12:47,950
I got...

4031
04:12:48,850 --> 04:12:50,590
A drinking horn.

4032
04:12:51,490 --> 04:12:53,570
A golden drinking horn from the 9th century A.D.

4033
04:12:53,670 --> 04:12:57,250
found in a Swedish Viking King burial mound near Uppsala.

4034
04:13:00,770 --> 04:13:02,070
It belongs in a museum.

4035
04:13:04,390 --> 04:13:06,210
It belongs in a museum.

4036
04:13:08,370 --> 04:13:08,810
Hello.

4037
04:13:08,810 --> 04:13:09,130
Okay.

4038
04:13:13,130 --> 04:13:15,730
What am I doing now?

4039
04:13:18,670 --> 04:13:20,690
Let's go back to the mad priest.

4040
04:13:21,830 --> 04:13:22,530
Oh, the sewers.

4041
04:13:22,770 --> 04:13:24,350
I don't want to go to the sewers.

4042
04:13:25,890 --> 04:13:27,110
I don't want to go to the sewers.

4043
04:13:27,450 --> 04:13:29,810
Oh, we have so much more stuff that's been...

4044
04:13:32,370 --> 04:13:34,210
Okay, Savage Discovery, we finished.

4045
04:13:34,830 --> 04:13:36,170
Secret of the Giants.

4046
04:13:38,090 --> 04:13:38,710
Kitty.

4047
04:13:40,110 --> 04:13:42,630
Secret of the Giants, we're so close to completing.

4048
04:13:42,750 --> 04:13:43,530
Let's just do that.

4049
04:13:49,000 --> 04:13:50,720
This game is huge.

4050
04:13:50,840 --> 04:13:51,660
I know, right?

4051
04:13:51,800 --> 04:13:52,440
My goodness.

4052
04:13:56,710 --> 04:13:58,010
This is open.

4053
04:14:00,270 --> 04:14:01,510
This way.

4054
04:14:04,990 --> 04:14:05,950
This way?

4055
04:14:06,750 --> 04:14:08,490
You're walking away from a picture.

4056
04:14:08,490 --> 04:14:11,950
The one on the wall?

4057
04:14:12,190 --> 04:14:13,130
I already got that one.

4058
04:14:17,700 --> 04:14:19,180
One of the photos is near.

4059
04:14:19,980 --> 04:14:21,360
Like the one right over here?

4060
04:14:22,140 --> 04:14:23,000
That one right there?

4061
04:14:29,940 --> 04:14:31,340
I don't understand...

4062
04:14:35,420 --> 04:14:36,720
He's feeding the pigeon.

4063
04:14:39,820 --> 04:14:41,220
Steppy, step on the pigeon.

4064
04:14:57,090 --> 04:14:58,590
What's the other photo I can take here?

4065
04:15:03,810 --> 04:15:05,570
Sorry, my hand slipped.

4066
04:15:08,090 --> 04:15:08,690
This?

4067
04:15:09,190 --> 04:15:10,010
Bird feeding?

4068
04:15:10,170 --> 04:15:11,210
It really is this.

4069
04:15:12,670 --> 04:15:13,610
Thank you sir.

4070
04:15:21,480 --> 04:15:22,920
There is nothing else over here?

4071
04:15:23,020 --> 04:15:23,900
I'm so confused.

4072
04:15:25,780 --> 04:15:30,040
How am I supposed to find these?

4073
04:15:33,200 --> 04:15:34,300
Good morning, Mito.

4074
04:15:34,400 --> 04:15:35,180
Good morning, Mito!

4075
04:15:39,690 --> 04:15:40,810
I'll just run.

4076
04:15:44,850 --> 04:15:45,810
In there?

4077
04:15:52,540 --> 04:15:53,420
Excuse me.

4078
04:15:53,680 --> 04:15:54,040
Thank you.

4079
04:15:54,820 --> 04:15:56,600
Heavy breathing, Indy.

4080
04:15:58,620 --> 04:16:00,000
Just walking with my book.

4081
04:16:00,080 --> 04:16:00,820
Don't mind me.

4082
04:16:03,660 --> 04:16:05,080
Walking with my book.

4083
04:16:06,620 --> 04:16:08,200
Don't mind me.

4084
04:16:09,720 --> 04:16:11,140
Literally making circles.

4085
04:16:18,620 --> 04:16:19,140
Huh?

4086
04:16:19,140 --> 04:16:20,860
There's one on the fountain, I guess?

4087
04:16:20,980 --> 04:16:21,140
Maybe?

4088
04:16:22,960 --> 04:16:23,420
Bless you.

4089
04:16:30,220 --> 04:16:32,020
Isn't this the guy we need to watch out for?

4090
04:16:32,460 --> 04:16:36,180
He might be.

4091
04:16:37,140 --> 04:16:40,530
God, please sir.

4092
04:16:43,980 --> 04:16:45,120
What the?

4093
04:16:53,120 --> 04:16:54,940
That's not...

4094
04:16:54,940 --> 04:16:55,680
What?

4095
04:17:01,700 --> 04:17:02,980
There's...

4096
04:17:02,980 --> 04:17:08,250
Up, up, up?

4097
04:17:10,970 --> 04:17:11,930
Hole?

4098
04:17:12,890 --> 04:17:13,690
Up here?

4099
04:17:17,750 --> 04:17:18,790
Oh my goodness.

4100
04:17:25,250 --> 04:17:26,210
Ninth!

4101
04:17:27,090 --> 04:17:29,350
And then the last.

4102
04:17:33,930 --> 04:17:35,850
The last.

4103
04:17:38,330 --> 04:17:39,890
The last?

4104
04:17:40,370 --> 04:17:41,770
Or like, good luck buddy.

4105
04:17:41,770 --> 04:17:43,050
No help.

4106
04:17:45,550 --> 04:17:46,590
No help.

4107
04:17:47,850 --> 04:17:49,270
You need to do the mad priest.

4108
04:17:49,910 --> 04:17:50,430
Alright,

4109
04:17:54,510 --> 04:17:55,610
we are going to the sewers.

4110
04:18:08,800 --> 04:18:10,080
Sewers, sewers, baby.

4111
04:18:13,680 --> 04:18:15,060
Sewers, sewers, baby.

4112
04:18:20,380 --> 04:18:21,620
Okay, so...

4113
04:18:22,400 --> 04:18:23,840
Sewers were...

4114
04:18:24,250 --> 04:18:25,260
I think I remember.

4115
04:18:25,760 --> 04:18:28,860
I'm just going to follow, honestly, the...

4116
04:18:28,860 --> 04:18:29,220
Yeah.

4117
04:18:35,960 --> 04:18:37,200
Buona giornata.

4118
04:18:41,050 --> 04:18:42,290
This way.

4119
04:18:45,970 --> 04:18:48,630
But we are getting stuff done, I guess.

4120
04:18:49,790 --> 04:18:51,310
In terms of quests and all.

4121
04:18:51,310 --> 04:18:52,850
How long have I been playing this for?

4122
04:18:55,690 --> 04:18:56,370
Sorry!

4123
04:18:59,070 --> 04:19:00,850
You okay computer?

4124
04:19:01,530 --> 04:19:02,050
My goodness.

4125
04:19:02,750 --> 04:19:04,110
Four hours, oh my gosh.

4126
04:19:11,180 --> 04:19:12,420
She's a ghost.

4127
04:19:13,020 --> 04:19:13,880
She's a phantom.

4128
04:19:15,620 --> 04:19:16,740
Freaky phantom.

4129
04:19:17,500 --> 04:19:18,780
She's a phantom, phantom.

4130
04:19:23,200 --> 04:19:24,920
Everybody is sneezing here.

4131
04:19:26,860 --> 04:19:28,380
Everybody is going to die.

4132
04:19:30,800 --> 04:19:33,280
No, that's not the guy we need to be worried about.

4133
04:19:46,020 --> 04:19:47,880
That's the guy we need to be worried about.

4134
04:19:51,160 --> 04:19:52,120
Excuse me.

4135
04:19:52,780 --> 04:19:53,960
Going into the sewers.

4136
04:19:59,580 --> 04:20:00,100
Down here.

4137
04:20:02,500 --> 04:20:03,920
No room for donuts.

4138
04:20:04,260 --> 04:20:05,360
I kind of want a donut now.

4139
04:20:07,980 --> 04:20:09,500
Is that that guy?

4140
04:20:16,040 --> 04:20:16,640
Oops.

4141
04:20:24,860 --> 04:20:25,460
Oops.

4142
04:20:25,460 --> 04:20:25,500
Oops.

4143
04:20:34,270 --> 04:20:37,750
How is there a trash can down here?

4144
04:20:37,930 --> 04:20:39,010
It's so awful.

4145
04:20:45,590 --> 04:20:46,970
My bad.

4146
04:20:49,550 --> 04:20:51,390
Do I...

4147
04:20:51,390 --> 04:20:52,290
Dive in?

4148
04:20:53,070 --> 04:20:53,690
Down there?

4149
04:20:55,210 --> 04:20:56,790
I can't see anything.

4150
04:20:57,670 --> 04:20:58,290
Wait.

4151
04:21:00,830 --> 04:21:02,070
Nasty.

4152
04:21:08,210 --> 04:21:11,870
The jump for like...

4153
04:21:11,870 --> 04:21:12,990
I see now.

4154
04:21:14,550 --> 04:21:17,850
The jump like from land...

4155
04:21:17,850 --> 04:21:20,230
Swimming to land is like really crazy.

4156
04:21:24,100 --> 04:21:26,020
Gamers don't look at...

4157
04:21:30,970 --> 04:21:31,890
What am I doing over here though?

4158
04:21:33,570 --> 04:21:35,970
Is this the palace entrance you desire?

4159
04:21:37,010 --> 04:21:37,410
Up here?

4160
04:21:50,860 --> 04:21:52,240
Streamers don't look up.

4161
04:21:55,820 --> 04:21:56,860
Streamers or gamers?

4162
04:22:03,940 --> 04:22:05,860
How do I reach it?

4163
04:22:17,420 --> 04:22:18,300
Up here?

4164
04:22:19,360 --> 04:22:19,900
Come on.

4165
04:22:20,080 --> 04:22:20,660
Come on Indy.

4166
04:22:22,240 --> 04:22:22,880
No?

4167
04:22:23,420 --> 04:22:24,140
Oh my god.

4168
04:22:24,280 --> 04:22:25,040
Please, Indy.

4169
04:22:28,920 --> 04:22:30,200
Call windows?

4170
04:22:30,500 --> 04:22:31,320
What do you mean windows?

4171
04:22:32,740 --> 04:22:33,720
White paint.

4172
04:22:34,500 --> 04:22:35,860
It's a white paint moment.

4173
04:22:39,360 --> 04:22:40,620
The white part?

4174
04:22:42,960 --> 04:22:44,300
What white part?

4175
04:22:45,240 --> 04:22:46,200
This one right here?

4176
04:22:48,040 --> 04:22:48,700
Oh!

4177
04:22:57,290 --> 04:22:58,230
And here?

4178
04:22:59,770 --> 04:23:00,870
And go up?

4179
04:23:04,190 --> 04:23:05,330
I'm gonna fall.

4180
04:23:14,680 --> 04:23:16,050
Pull up the pipe?

4181
04:23:16,090 --> 04:23:16,630
I'm trying!

4182
04:23:18,230 --> 04:23:19,330
I'm trying!

4183
04:23:20,770 --> 04:23:22,030
Why are you crouched, Indy?

4184
04:23:22,970 --> 04:23:23,630
Wait.

4185
04:23:24,250 --> 04:23:25,610
No, I keep going on the table.

4186
04:23:29,290 --> 04:23:31,570
That, maybe that one right there.

4187
04:23:35,370 --> 04:23:37,610
I keep going over, over, over.

4188
04:23:38,430 --> 04:23:40,130
And over to this one maybe.

4189
04:23:44,330 --> 04:23:45,610
Oh gosh, Indy.

4190
04:23:46,110 --> 04:23:47,550
Indy, your stamina.

4191
04:23:48,850 --> 04:23:49,670
Indy, your stamina.

4192
04:23:59,850 --> 04:24:00,450
Barbie!

4193
04:24:04,630 --> 04:24:05,310
Data

4194
04:24:10,420 --> 04:24:11,080
Jones!

4195
04:24:19,790 --> 04:24:22,470
Oh my god!

4196
04:24:30,430 --> 04:24:33,870
Yeah, I'm very disappointed in Indy right now.

4197
04:24:36,430 --> 04:24:38,070
He's an older gentleman now.

4198
04:24:38,130 --> 04:24:39,370
Not in this game!

4199
04:24:40,030 --> 04:24:41,090
Don't give me that!

4200
04:24:42,590 --> 04:24:44,650
If you stop it replenishes your...it does?

4201
04:24:46,190 --> 04:24:47,690
Oh, you're right.

4202
04:24:48,250 --> 04:24:48,990
Perfect.

4203
04:24:52,530 --> 04:24:52,750
Barbie!

4204
04:25:01,430 --> 04:25:03,470
Good job, Indy.

4205
04:25:05,550 --> 04:25:06,070
And over.

4206
04:25:09,950 --> 04:25:11,210
His little grunts.

4207
04:25:11,530 --> 04:25:12,410
His little groans.

4208
04:25:16,930 --> 04:25:18,010
Nice.

4209
04:25:31,450 --> 04:25:31,990
Go up!

4210
04:25:32,670 --> 04:25:33,190
Go up!

4211
04:25:33,990 --> 04:25:34,670
Go up!

4212
04:25:55,380 --> 04:25:57,680
Why didn't he go up?

4213
04:26:10,980 --> 04:26:13,580
The great circle continues.

4214
04:26:37,490 --> 04:26:39,250
OK, spider monkey.

4215
04:26:43,040 --> 04:26:45,560
I was stuck in here for like 20 minutes.

4216
04:26:46,980 --> 04:26:51,680
My gosh, just what the hell?

4217
04:26:52,360 --> 04:26:53,540
I'm so confused.

4218
04:26:53,720 --> 04:26:54,740
What did I do wrong?

4219
04:26:59,520 --> 04:27:01,280
What did I do wrong?

4220
04:27:17,840 --> 04:27:18,620
Gentle drop.

4221
04:27:26,720 --> 04:27:27,200
Indy.

4222
04:27:28,140 --> 04:27:28,620
Indy.

4223
04:27:30,480 --> 04:27:30,960
Indy.

4224
04:27:32,860 --> 04:27:33,340
Indy.

4225
04:27:40,400 --> 04:27:42,320
What do you mean land on the pipes?

4226
04:27:42,380 --> 04:27:43,720
It says to climb the whip.

4227
04:27:43,780 --> 04:27:45,460
It literally gives me the tutorial.

4228
04:27:48,200 --> 04:27:49,080
I did it.

4229
04:27:49,420 --> 04:27:49,960
I had to.

4230
04:27:50,060 --> 04:27:52,240
I had to change my camera angle.

4231
04:27:52,400 --> 04:27:53,320
Are you for real?

4232
04:27:53,380 --> 04:27:54,280
Be for real right now.

4233
04:27:54,280 --> 04:27:55,420
No way.

4234
04:27:55,720 --> 04:27:57,620
I had to change my camera angle.

4235
04:28:00,360 --> 04:28:02,140
Oh my god.

4236
04:28:02,380 --> 04:28:03,040
OK, wait.

4237
04:28:04,380 --> 04:28:06,000
Am I going all the way up there?

4238
04:28:11,720 --> 04:28:12,280
Yep.

4239
04:28:12,420 --> 04:28:13,040
Oh, OK.

4240
04:28:13,200 --> 04:28:14,120
Don't hit that.

4241
04:28:14,820 --> 04:28:15,760
You lose all momentum.

4242
04:28:15,760 --> 04:28:15,880
Momentum.

4243
04:28:23,710 --> 04:28:27,070
Oh my gosh and we did it.

4244
04:28:27,770 --> 04:28:29,710
We got the final one.

4245
04:28:31,350 --> 04:28:31,950
Nice.

4246
04:28:32,910 --> 04:28:35,370
Oh, there we go.

4247
04:28:38,910 --> 04:28:39,990
Yippee!

4248
04:28:41,270 --> 04:28:42,870
Tenth inscription.

4249
04:28:44,070 --> 04:28:46,850
OK, find the palace entrance.

4250
04:28:46,850 --> 04:28:49,610
Oh, that's...this way.

4251
04:28:52,290 --> 04:28:53,430
Oh my gosh.

4252
04:28:55,810 --> 04:28:57,370
We did it guys.

4253
04:28:58,550 --> 04:28:59,730
Good job us.

4254
04:29:06,170 --> 04:29:07,450
Where is this anyway?

4255
04:29:10,370 --> 04:29:12,890
If I put on a black shirt uniform...

4256
04:29:14,030 --> 04:29:15,290
Am I going to be OK?

4257
04:29:18,880 --> 04:29:20,640
I don't remember why I'm in here.

4258
04:29:22,660 --> 04:29:24,760
Oh, we're finding out secrets of the giants.

4259
04:29:26,860 --> 04:29:27,920
This is not a door.

4260
04:29:28,160 --> 04:29:28,820
This is a door.

4261
04:29:39,590 --> 04:29:40,070
OK,

4262
04:29:43,610 --> 04:29:44,010
never mind.

4263
04:29:44,310 --> 04:29:48,050
Even being in an outfit makes you not safe.

4264
04:29:48,650 --> 04:29:50,530
So in this outfit it is, baby.

4265
04:29:51,510 --> 04:29:51,870
Nice.

4266
04:29:56,100 --> 04:29:57,780
How many guys do you think are in here?

4267
04:29:59,600 --> 04:30:00,620
I saw one.

4268
04:30:00,620 --> 04:30:02,560
Me, me.

4269
04:30:03,760 --> 04:30:04,500
Iron grip.

4270
04:30:05,560 --> 04:30:06,420
Take that.

4271
04:30:09,420 --> 04:30:11,260
Where did that guy go?

4272
04:30:11,700 --> 04:30:12,780
Oh, he's walking outside.

4273
04:30:14,580 --> 04:30:15,840
He's coughing.

4274
04:30:17,740 --> 04:30:18,280
What's this?

4275
04:30:19,300 --> 04:30:19,600
Document.

4276
04:30:20,740 --> 04:30:22,160
Pompeian death mask.

4277
04:30:22,280 --> 04:30:23,640
Oh, confiscation manifest.

4278
04:30:24,620 --> 04:30:26,360
Oh, obscene idol.

4279
04:30:27,600 --> 04:30:28,500
Is that me?

4280
04:30:29,880 --> 04:30:31,200
Jointed death figurine.

4281
04:30:31,260 --> 04:30:31,960
No, that's me.

4282
04:30:35,340 --> 04:30:37,560
Demonic kidney form seal.

4283
04:30:38,720 --> 04:30:39,200
Acceptable.

4284
04:30:56,260 --> 04:30:57,440
That spooked me.

4285
04:30:57,800 --> 04:30:58,260
Is there a guy?

4286
04:30:59,580 --> 04:31:00,480
Oh no, that's not a guy.

4287
04:31:03,840 --> 04:31:04,940
I wish I had a weapon.

4288
04:31:05,600 --> 04:31:10,230
Can I unlock this?

4289
04:31:11,510 --> 04:31:11,790
Nice.

4290
04:31:13,830 --> 04:31:19,610
I don't know where this leads out to either, but we have another exit, which is always good.

4291
04:31:24,240 --> 04:31:24,960
Photo.

4292
04:31:30,290 --> 04:31:31,610
Vatican seal.

4293
04:31:32,510 --> 04:31:32,830
Here?

4294
04:31:34,190 --> 04:31:34,550
Nice.

4295
04:31:36,250 --> 04:31:37,830
Alright, put that away.

4296
04:31:39,710 --> 04:31:41,110
My fists are my weapons.

4297
04:31:44,960 --> 04:31:47,600
Oh, we're at the dig site.

4298
04:31:48,720 --> 04:31:50,160
I don't think I need to...

4299
04:31:54,500 --> 04:31:55,380
Stolen artifacts.

4300
04:31:56,240 --> 04:31:57,040
Picture proof.

4301
04:31:57,640 --> 04:31:57,960
Nice.

4302
04:31:58,400 --> 04:32:01,440
I don't think I need to get him then.

4303
04:32:03,280 --> 04:32:03,720
Right?

4304
04:32:03,720 --> 04:32:04,160
Because...

4305
04:32:05,740 --> 04:32:07,480
There's probably somebody in here I need to get.

4306
04:32:08,820 --> 04:32:10,380
Oh wait, just kidding.

4307
04:32:10,540 --> 04:32:11,460
I do need to go that way.

4308
04:32:11,620 --> 04:32:12,000
I'm an idiot.

4309
04:32:12,000 --> 04:32:14,700
Wait, there's something over there.

4310
04:32:14,980 --> 04:32:16,000
Oh I have to find the diary.

4311
04:32:19,480 --> 04:32:20,720
Yeah, duh.

4312
04:32:21,600 --> 04:32:22,880
We're finding the diary everybody.

4313
04:32:27,830 --> 04:32:29,010
Oh, maybe in here?

4314
04:32:33,570 --> 04:32:34,130
Bingo.

4315
04:32:35,370 --> 04:32:35,970
Grab it.

4316
04:32:39,230 --> 04:32:39,990
Got it.

4317
04:32:41,990 --> 04:32:43,270
I'm so good.

4318
04:32:43,470 --> 04:32:44,770
I'm so stealthy.

4319
04:32:48,650 --> 04:32:51,610
Girl smell, girl smell, girl smell.

4320
04:32:53,390 --> 04:32:55,690
Indy, I don't... this is not the place.

4321
04:32:55,910 --> 04:32:57,110
Indy, this is not the place.

4322
04:33:01,270 --> 04:33:02,310
Yeah, I went there.

4323
04:33:17,320 --> 04:33:17,760
Yeah.

4324
04:33:17,760 --> 04:33:17,880
Yeah.

4325
04:33:21,160 --> 04:33:22,640
That's what that other guy said.

4326
04:33:22,700 --> 04:33:24,020
That the giants come out at night.

4327
04:33:26,280 --> 04:33:27,400
Or rather in the darkness.

4328
04:33:31,000 --> 04:33:31,480
Spooky.

4329
04:33:31,480 --> 04:33:31,960
Spooky.

4330
04:33:37,940 --> 04:33:39,640
Ok, so now we return to her.

4331
04:33:47,520 --> 04:33:48,740
Where is this?

4332
04:33:52,420 --> 04:33:52,940
Oh.

4333
04:33:58,720 --> 04:33:59,940
What the hell?

4334
04:34:00,300 --> 04:34:01,540
You were asleep!

4335
04:34:02,700 --> 04:34:03,740
God dammit.

4336
04:34:06,360 --> 04:34:08,540
Oh, that's where I was going to put you actually.

4337
04:34:09,280 --> 04:34:12,040
I wanted your fruit, so I was just going to...

4338
04:34:12,040 --> 04:34:15,220
Ok, well this works too I guess.

4339
04:34:22,400 --> 04:34:24,820
Get that lemon, get that orange, get that other lemon.

4340
04:34:28,480 --> 04:34:30,120
Oh, you got some bread here too.

4341
04:34:30,580 --> 04:34:31,660
Don't mind if I do.

4342
04:34:32,000 --> 04:34:33,000
Yeah, thank you.

4343
04:34:33,360 --> 04:34:36,940
And I'm going to change back into our little friend's outfit.

4344
04:34:37,120 --> 04:34:37,400
Perfect.

4345
04:34:39,540 --> 04:34:40,060
Cat?

4346
04:34:47,540 --> 04:34:48,060
Where?

4347
04:34:54,040 --> 04:34:54,560
Kitty.

4348
04:34:55,440 --> 04:34:56,380
Where the hell am I?

4349
04:34:56,460 --> 04:34:56,980
Cat!

4350
04:34:56,980 --> 04:34:57,620
Cat!

4351
04:35:00,480 --> 04:35:03,000
You are just so cute!

4352
04:35:06,540 --> 04:35:07,760
Oh wow.

4353
04:35:10,020 --> 04:35:11,720
No, I wanted you stretching.

4354
04:35:11,940 --> 04:35:12,720
I wanted you stretching.

4355
04:35:13,500 --> 04:35:14,600
Oh, your fur.

4356
04:35:15,840 --> 04:35:17,100
It's a little scraggly.

4357
04:35:17,300 --> 04:35:17,640
That's ok.

4358
04:35:18,940 --> 04:35:19,740
No!

4359
04:35:20,900 --> 04:35:21,940
One star?

4360
04:35:22,460 --> 04:35:25,040
Cats are five star items.

4361
04:35:29,780 --> 04:35:30,280
Perfect!

4362
04:35:31,760 --> 04:35:33,040
Why are you like this?

4363
04:35:33,660 --> 04:35:34,360
Indiana Jones.

4364
04:35:35,800 --> 04:35:37,020
Why are you like this?

4365
04:35:37,480 --> 04:35:38,420
Say prunes.

4366
04:35:39,440 --> 04:35:40,300
Where am I?

4367
04:35:43,580 --> 04:35:45,140
Wait, did I need to go back up?

4368
04:35:45,580 --> 04:35:47,180
No, I'm going my own way.

4369
04:35:49,260 --> 04:35:50,620
Oh, I know where I am.

4370
04:35:55,760 --> 04:35:56,960
I know where I am.

4371
04:35:57,560 --> 04:36:00,200
And then I'm back here.

4372
04:36:00,200 --> 04:36:00,240
Yeah.

4373
04:36:01,720 --> 04:36:02,740
I knew.

4374
04:36:04,660 --> 04:36:05,760
Andy is a dog person.

4375
04:36:05,860 --> 04:36:06,620
He is.

4376
04:36:06,720 --> 04:36:07,360
He is.

4377
04:36:07,420 --> 04:36:08,160
He is.

4378
04:36:10,880 --> 04:36:11,840
Let's see.

4379
04:36:12,840 --> 04:36:14,840
Give the diary to sister Catherine.

4380
04:36:32,880 --> 04:36:33,520
Important.

4381
04:36:33,820 --> 04:36:34,140
Important.

4382
04:36:34,420 --> 04:36:34,740
Important.

4383
04:36:36,140 --> 04:36:37,680
Hey, I'm busy.

4384
04:36:37,980 --> 04:36:38,720
Don't talk to me.

4385
04:36:41,040 --> 04:36:41,680
Alright.

4386
04:36:42,300 --> 04:36:47,380
Even if you are a dog person or a cat person, it doesn't mean you should be mean.

4387
04:36:48,280 --> 04:36:49,320
You know, depending.

4388
04:36:49,440 --> 04:36:50,700
You should not be mean to the other.

4389
04:36:52,140 --> 04:36:54,040
You guys, we can go into the box.

4390
04:36:56,830 --> 04:36:57,870
We can go in here.

4391
04:37:12,330 --> 04:37:15,130
Oh my god, we got welcomed in by Solidus.

4392
04:37:23,470 --> 04:37:24,770
You don't know who I am.

4393
04:37:24,990 --> 04:37:25,890
How do you know who I am?

4394
04:37:34,050 --> 04:37:34,490
No,

4395
04:37:39,700 --> 04:37:40,140
that's...

4396
04:37:46,720 --> 04:37:47,160
Oh.

4397
04:37:48,980 --> 04:37:49,420
Hi.

4398
04:37:50,240 --> 04:37:51,840
What did I get myself into?

4399
04:38:00,900 --> 04:38:01,980
Oh, really?

4400
04:38:06,860 --> 04:38:08,260
He's in his undies.

4401
04:38:11,880 --> 04:38:12,520
Oh.

4402
04:38:13,660 --> 04:38:14,040
What?

4403
04:38:15,020 --> 04:38:16,880
It's so expensive.

4404
04:38:17,400 --> 04:38:18,300
Oh my god.

4405
04:38:18,500 --> 04:38:19,180
What is this one?

4406
04:38:19,280 --> 04:38:19,880
Hard boiled.

4407
04:38:20,780 --> 04:38:23,300
Hardened protection by merging two health bars into one.

4408
04:38:26,180 --> 04:38:27,360
Pretend he's a medic.

4409
04:38:30,720 --> 04:38:30,900
What?

4410
04:38:35,520 --> 04:38:35,960
Oh.

4411
04:38:46,120 --> 04:38:46,560
Thanks.

4412
04:38:49,720 --> 04:38:50,160
Thanks.

4413
04:38:51,080 --> 04:38:53,020
First time I've ever gotten money legally.

4414
04:38:53,780 --> 04:38:55,980
Well, I guess this isn't really legal, but you know.

4415
04:38:56,200 --> 04:38:56,620
Oh.

4416
04:38:57,660 --> 04:38:59,460
Yeah, I took your ass out, dummy.

4417
04:39:00,140 --> 04:39:00,680
What is this?

4418
04:39:09,640 --> 04:39:10,720
Can I take this?

4419
04:39:13,940 --> 04:39:14,340
Or...

4420
04:39:23,890 --> 04:39:25,070
First guy has no pants.

4421
04:39:25,190 --> 04:39:26,030
Second guy has no shirt.

4422
04:39:26,130 --> 04:39:26,510
Look at him.

4423
04:39:26,570 --> 04:39:27,550
He's huge though.

4424
04:39:28,550 --> 04:39:29,350
He's huge!

4425
04:39:43,110 --> 04:39:46,630
Wait, did I take my money?

4426
04:39:47,950 --> 04:39:49,450
Don't drag me out!

4427
04:39:49,630 --> 04:39:50,610
I can keep going!

4428
04:39:52,470 --> 04:39:53,890
Did I take my money?

4429
04:40:02,450 --> 04:40:03,130
No!

4430
04:40:08,030 --> 04:40:09,390
Bad angle.

4431
04:40:10,070 --> 04:40:12,230
What do you mean?

4432
04:40:19,110 --> 04:40:20,030
There.

4433
04:40:22,530 --> 04:40:23,690
Got a parry.

4434
04:40:27,590 --> 04:40:29,190
Bandages on post.

4435
04:40:30,610 --> 04:40:31,850
Oh, thank you!

4436
04:40:33,770 --> 04:40:36,270
Wait, are these like unlimited bandages?

4437
04:40:36,410 --> 04:40:37,030
That'd be sick.

4438
04:40:39,990 --> 04:40:41,710
Why always bad apple?

4439
04:40:41,990 --> 04:40:43,610
Because it sounds like bad angle.

4440
04:40:47,450 --> 04:40:48,610
Yeah, but unlimited?

4441
04:40:48,810 --> 04:40:49,430
No way.

4442
04:40:55,940 --> 04:40:56,500
Awesome!

4443
04:40:58,040 --> 04:40:59,920
Hold on, I'm going to eat some bread.

4444
04:40:59,920 --> 04:41:00,100
Boo!

4445
04:41:06,250 --> 04:41:06,770
Boo!

4446
04:41:07,950 --> 04:41:08,270
Boo!

4447
04:41:09,450 --> 04:41:10,530
Boo!

4448
04:41:12,890 --> 04:41:16,210
I need more bread.

4449
04:41:25,000 --> 04:41:26,120
Yeah.

4450
04:41:26,900 --> 04:41:27,740
Alright.

4451
04:41:33,650 --> 04:41:34,450
Hey!

4452
04:41:34,630 --> 04:41:35,470
Oh, I can dodge?

4453
04:41:36,210 --> 04:41:36,990
Oh my God.

4454
04:41:43,420 --> 04:41:45,360
Why is this so much more difficult?

4455
04:41:47,520 --> 04:41:51,140
Press to review hand to hand combat controls.

4456
04:41:52,200 --> 04:41:53,820
Oh my God!

4457
04:41:55,540 --> 04:41:57,800
He hits so hard!

4458
04:42:01,380 --> 04:42:02,080
Oh,

4459
04:42:05,830 --> 04:42:09,710
I didn't...Wait, no, I was on...I was on health.

4460
04:42:10,510 --> 04:42:12,270
Why didn't it give me a lemon?

4461
04:42:15,490 --> 04:42:17,290
He has the dominant genes.

4462
04:42:19,610 --> 04:42:21,530
I hope they replenish the donuts.

4463
04:42:25,500 --> 04:42:27,480
I'm always going to come here for...

4464
04:42:29,260 --> 04:42:30,220
They didn't!

4465
04:42:30,260 --> 04:42:30,500
No!

4466
04:42:31,820 --> 04:42:32,680
I'll take a fig.

4467
04:42:33,560 --> 04:42:33,940
Nice.

4468
04:42:36,980 --> 04:42:38,600
Wait, oh, there's some stuff over here.

4469
04:42:38,680 --> 04:42:39,040
What's this?

4470
04:42:41,980 --> 04:42:43,240
And then lemons.

4471
04:42:45,480 --> 04:42:48,960
I think though guys, maybe we'll try next time with him.

4472
04:42:52,320 --> 04:42:54,220
How much money do I have anyway?

4473
04:42:55,020 --> 04:42:56,520
I have enough money!

4474
04:42:57,420 --> 04:42:59,460
I do have enough money for these.

4475
04:43:00,800 --> 04:43:02,480
And this one is...

4476
04:43:04,560 --> 04:43:07,120
Bandage inventory capacity is increased by one.

4477
04:43:20,660 --> 04:43:21,760
Thank you!

4478
04:43:26,520 --> 04:43:27,740
Iron grip.

4479
04:43:28,660 --> 04:43:29,460
No, not yet.

4480
04:43:30,220 --> 04:43:31,100
Hard boiled.

4481
04:43:34,060 --> 04:43:34,860
Nice!

4482
04:43:35,880 --> 04:43:36,800
Egg powers.

4483
04:43:37,160 --> 04:43:37,680
Yeah.

4484
04:43:40,720 --> 04:43:43,020
Indie can clinch enemies for longer.

4485
04:43:43,800 --> 04:43:45,060
Ah, look at that!

4486
04:43:45,460 --> 04:43:46,800
I've never done that before though.

4487
04:43:53,720 --> 04:43:55,700
We'll do that next time.

4488
04:43:56,000 --> 04:43:58,760
I don't quite feel like doing it anymore.

4489
04:43:59,340 --> 04:44:00,680
Not a fighter, eh?

4490
04:44:00,860 --> 04:44:01,240
Shut up.

4491
04:44:02,220 --> 04:44:02,600
I'm busy.

4492
04:44:04,120 --> 04:44:05,080
I'm busy!

4493
04:44:05,900 --> 04:44:06,700
I'm busy!

4494
04:44:10,440 --> 04:44:14,140
We gotta go deliver this to sister Catherine.

4495
04:44:16,500 --> 04:44:18,900
And then we go to Antonio.

4496
04:44:18,900 --> 04:44:23,560
And then maybe next time we do the fountain.

4497
04:44:30,000 --> 04:44:31,920
Since I'm starting to get hungry.

4498
04:44:36,030 --> 04:44:37,570
Walking around with the dog.

4499
04:44:39,090 --> 04:44:41,330
But I think we made good progress today.

4500
04:44:47,750 --> 04:44:48,390
Change!

4501
04:44:54,220 --> 04:44:56,780
The door just immediately opened.

4502
04:44:57,700 --> 04:45:01,650
Where is the delivery?

4503
04:45:01,910 --> 04:45:03,330
I'm right here!

4504
04:45:06,590 --> 04:45:09,390
Hey sister.

4505
04:45:32,350 --> 04:45:33,190
Thanks.

4506
04:45:35,150 --> 04:45:35,610
Why?

4507
04:45:35,710 --> 04:45:37,430
You think I'm the...

4508
04:45:42,210 --> 04:45:43,890
From Boston.

4509
04:45:44,110 --> 04:45:46,430
I mean she speaks perfect English so...

4510
04:45:48,270 --> 04:45:48,750
What?

4511
04:45:52,370 --> 04:45:53,210
Yeah.

4512
04:45:58,430 --> 04:46:00,830
Father Gallagher.

4513
04:46:33,630 --> 04:46:38,850
He looks like the guy from Hunchback of Notre Dame.

4514
04:46:48,830 --> 04:46:49,570
Hellfire!

4515
04:46:50,370 --> 04:46:51,610
Yeah, that guy.

4516
04:46:55,150 --> 04:46:55,890
Snooping.

4517
04:46:55,990 --> 04:46:56,930
Whoa, what a great shot.

4518
04:46:57,870 --> 04:46:58,230
Yay!

4519
04:47:01,510 --> 04:47:02,510
Making progress.

4520
04:47:02,750 --> 04:47:03,470
That's what I said.

4521
04:47:06,270 --> 04:47:06,770
Nice.

4522
04:47:08,450 --> 04:47:09,450
So now...

4523
04:47:10,690 --> 04:47:12,790
We can do Secret of the Giants.

4524
04:47:12,890 --> 04:47:15,130
That's just going back to...

4525
04:47:15,130 --> 04:47:17,450
Oh wait, I want to do a Nun in Trouble too.

4526
04:47:17,730 --> 04:47:18,690
Borgia Tower.

4527
04:47:18,910 --> 04:47:19,090
OK.

4528
04:47:19,590 --> 04:47:25,510
I want to finish the side quest before we go back to the main one, you know?

4529
04:47:29,640 --> 04:47:30,320
So...

4530
04:47:30,320 --> 04:47:32,020
We'll do these two.

4531
04:47:33,800 --> 04:47:37,840
And then we can kick off the next stream with the fountain.

4532
04:47:38,100 --> 04:47:40,080
With the continuing cat mummy.

4533
04:47:40,700 --> 04:47:41,220
Rafi!

4534
04:47:41,540 --> 04:47:42,160
Thanks for the gift!

4535
04:47:45,920 --> 04:47:47,280
Quick travel.

4536
04:47:49,700 --> 04:47:50,520
Go to Antonio.

4537
04:47:58,060 --> 04:47:58,900
Antonio.

4538
04:47:58,900 --> 04:47:59,160
Bless you.

4539
04:48:01,400 --> 04:48:03,520
Everybody sneezes here.

4540
04:48:04,020 --> 04:48:05,800
I think they are all infected.

4541
04:48:06,500 --> 04:48:10,120
There is something seriously wrong going on in here.

4542
04:48:10,840 --> 04:48:13,960
And it's not just the obvious stuff.

4543
04:48:14,560 --> 04:48:17,780
There are other underlying horrible things going on here.

4544
04:48:22,400 --> 04:48:22,860
Isaac!

4545
04:48:23,100 --> 04:48:23,840
Thank you for the gift!

4546
04:48:23,960 --> 04:48:24,780
Thank you, thank you!

4547
04:48:26,960 --> 04:48:27,880
Tiny Tiefling!

4548
04:48:28,260 --> 04:48:29,500
Thank you for the five gift!

4549
04:48:30,000 --> 04:48:31,160
Thank you so much!

4550
04:48:32,120 --> 04:48:32,800
I'm back!

4551
04:48:37,960 --> 04:48:38,880
Oh my

4552
04:48:45,140 --> 04:48:46,980
God!

4553
04:48:47,020 --> 04:48:47,720
I can't hear it!

4554
04:48:48,280 --> 04:48:49,340
I can't hear!

4555
04:48:54,180 --> 04:48:57,040
Princess Denmark, thank you for the ten gift!

4556
04:48:58,160 --> 04:48:59,480
What just...

4557
04:49:00,740 --> 04:49:03,060
Oh my fucking God!

4558
04:49:03,140 --> 04:49:04,380
Are you kidding me?

4559
04:49:06,860 --> 04:49:07,340
No!

4560
04:49:10,390 --> 04:49:12,490
All that for this thing!

4561
04:49:27,210 --> 04:49:29,990
You have to be kidding me!

4562
04:49:31,070 --> 04:49:32,030
OK.

4563
04:49:32,970 --> 04:49:34,070
The tower.

4564
04:49:34,070 --> 04:49:42,660
I don't even know what we...

4565
04:49:43,380 --> 04:49:44,960
It's a tool for later?

4566
04:49:45,540 --> 04:49:46,100
Is it really?

4567
04:49:46,640 --> 04:49:48,500
Because I have no idea what we use it for.

4568
04:49:48,920 --> 04:49:50,560
I just keep collecting them.

4569
04:49:52,500 --> 04:49:53,540
I have no idea.

4570
04:50:00,000 --> 04:50:01,800
A picture of him?

4571
04:50:01,940 --> 04:50:03,020
That's so sweet.

4572
04:50:03,020 --> 04:50:03,840
OK.

4573
04:50:04,700 --> 04:50:05,540
All the way up there.

4574
04:50:05,660 --> 04:50:06,800
Gosh, I love this view!

4575
04:50:12,540 --> 04:50:14,080
Eventually you make a circle out of them.

4576
04:50:14,860 --> 04:50:15,300
No!

4577
04:50:15,940 --> 04:50:16,360
What?

4578
04:50:16,940 --> 04:50:17,340
No!

4579
04:50:17,560 --> 04:50:18,920
Is that the great circle?

4580
04:50:22,140 --> 04:50:25,180
Don't, don't, don't, don't get my hopes up.

4581
04:50:26,060 --> 04:50:27,300
Don't get my hopes up.

4582
04:50:27,300 --> 04:50:27,780
Ah!

4583
04:50:36,280 --> 04:50:36,860
Oh.

4584
04:50:37,480 --> 04:50:37,900
My bad.

4585
04:50:40,040 --> 04:50:40,860
Stop staring!

4586
04:50:41,040 --> 04:50:42,140
I'm trying to change!

4587
04:50:43,260 --> 04:50:43,840
Gross.

4588
04:50:44,340 --> 04:50:46,980
Indiana Jones is the prologue to Among Us all along.

4589
04:50:47,420 --> 04:50:50,540
Ending will probably be Indy playing Among Us with his friends using the relics.

4590
04:50:52,780 --> 04:50:54,520
This relic is sus.

4591
04:50:55,120 --> 04:50:55,360
Hello?

4592
04:50:56,160 --> 04:50:56,580
Indy.

4593
04:50:58,020 --> 04:50:58,600
Indy.

4594
04:50:59,360 --> 04:51:00,980
What is wrong with you?

4595
04:51:17,260 --> 04:51:17,980
What the?

4596
04:51:18,320 --> 04:51:18,900
Oh my god.

4597
04:51:19,240 --> 04:51:20,280
I've never done that before.

4598
04:51:21,180 --> 04:51:21,920
Oh, it's here.

4599
04:51:21,980 --> 04:51:22,400
The white bit.

4600
04:51:33,900 --> 04:51:34,800
Coughing baby.

4601
04:51:39,580 --> 04:51:40,860
Oh, excuse me.

4602
04:51:48,350 --> 04:51:49,390
Please, Indy.

4603
04:51:49,850 --> 04:51:51,290
Why do you do this?

4604
04:51:52,090 --> 04:51:53,910
Why do you do this to me?

4605
04:51:54,250 --> 04:51:55,490
I don't understand.

4606
04:51:55,490 --> 04:51:56,250
Oh my god.

4607
04:51:57,090 --> 04:51:59,890
Oh my gosh.

4608
04:52:03,270 --> 04:52:05,850
The climbing sometimes in this game is so whack.

4609
04:52:06,510 --> 04:52:08,390
Please, stand up.

4610
04:52:09,250 --> 04:52:09,650
Ok.

4611
04:52:10,770 --> 04:52:11,710
Why are we crouched?

4612
04:52:14,330 --> 04:52:15,170
In here.

4613
04:52:19,760 --> 04:52:21,600
Yeah, you left me for dead.

4614
04:52:23,960 --> 04:52:25,560
You left me for dead.

4615
04:52:29,540 --> 04:52:30,300
Follow me.

4616
04:52:31,140 --> 04:52:31,960
Actually, don't.

4617
04:52:32,060 --> 04:52:33,340
Because I don't... Why would you say that?

4618
04:52:33,360 --> 04:52:34,160
I don't know where I'm going.

4619
04:52:37,600 --> 04:52:39,720
I mean, of course there are, but...

4620
04:52:42,580 --> 04:52:43,720
She's ready for combat.

4621
04:52:47,000 --> 04:52:47,540
Get him.

4622
04:52:49,120 --> 04:52:49,540
Sick him.

4623
04:52:49,800 --> 04:52:50,340
Sick him, girl.

4624
04:52:54,400 --> 04:52:55,060
Oh my gosh.

4625
04:52:55,220 --> 04:52:56,040
There's several people.

4626
04:53:01,250 --> 04:53:03,910
Ok, maybe we can get this guy first.

4627
04:53:05,810 --> 04:53:07,470
Oh, this guy first.

4628
04:53:09,950 --> 04:53:10,550
Nevermind.

4629
04:53:10,850 --> 04:53:12,170
Oh my gosh, what are you doing?

4630
04:53:18,310 --> 04:53:20,350
Ma'am, do something!

4631
04:53:23,090 --> 04:53:23,690
Yeah!

4632
04:53:27,150 --> 04:53:28,430
Oh, ouch!

4633
04:53:33,250 --> 04:53:34,310
Where's your weapon?

4634
04:53:35,630 --> 04:53:35,930
Hey!

4635
04:53:36,390 --> 04:53:37,350
Leave her alone!

4636
04:53:44,310 --> 04:53:46,330
Oh my god.

4637
04:53:50,060 --> 04:53:51,100
Take the donut.

4638
04:53:51,420 --> 04:53:52,080
Take the donut.

4639
04:53:52,360 --> 04:53:53,040
Oh, is that?

4640
04:53:53,460 --> 04:53:54,260
Oh no, that's a bottle.

4641
04:53:54,800 --> 04:53:55,140
Nevermind.

4642
04:53:56,360 --> 04:53:58,620
Ma'am, you did this!

4643
04:53:59,260 --> 04:54:03,280
I was hiding and then you ruined it!

4644
04:54:10,930 --> 04:54:11,610
Anyway...

4645
04:54:11,610 --> 04:54:12,610
God damn!

4646
04:54:14,090 --> 04:54:15,030
Almost blew our...

4647
04:54:15,030 --> 04:54:17,970
Oh, top of the tower.

4648
04:54:18,970 --> 04:54:19,570
No!

4649
04:54:21,530 --> 04:54:22,090
We're back!

4650
04:54:23,650 --> 04:54:25,330
She's working for the enemy.

4651
04:54:25,830 --> 04:54:26,730
I swear to god.

4652
04:54:27,570 --> 04:54:30,030
She just ran in front of him.

4653
04:54:31,010 --> 04:54:33,450
Minto, I watched yours and Doki's concert online.

4654
04:54:33,510 --> 04:54:37,570
The both of you and the guests all have wonderful stage presence and knocked it out of the park.

4655
04:54:37,650 --> 04:54:38,930
Can't stop singing along with you all.

4656
04:54:39,690 --> 04:54:40,850
Thank you, Tri Princess!

4657
04:54:41,090 --> 04:54:42,630
I appreciate it so much!

4658
04:54:46,530 --> 04:54:50,990
Oh, the tower card.

4659
04:54:51,570 --> 04:54:53,650
That's kind of... That's fitting, right?

4660
04:54:55,890 --> 04:54:56,870
Thanks, Indy.

4661
04:54:57,710 --> 04:54:59,350
Get some original thoughts, my man.

4662
04:55:05,500 --> 04:55:06,780
Oh, thank you!

4663
04:55:09,760 --> 04:55:17,440
I think somebody almost slipped the wrong way with his neck.

4664
04:55:20,260 --> 04:55:21,920
He broke his neck.

4665
04:55:22,300 --> 04:55:24,560
He's that committed to the cause, you know?

4666
04:55:25,440 --> 04:55:26,820
He'll break his neck for this.

4667
04:55:28,140 --> 04:55:29,540
Oh yeah, baby!

4668
04:55:30,920 --> 04:55:32,300
That's for the next book.

4669
04:55:35,820 --> 04:55:38,020
It sounds like the Looney Tunes theme.

4670
04:55:40,580 --> 04:55:41,180
Oh,

4671
04:55:49,860 --> 04:55:50,840
I think that's the guy outside.

4672
04:55:51,560 --> 04:55:52,240
The whistling man.

4673
04:55:58,540 --> 04:56:01,020
How do I...

4674
04:56:05,060 --> 04:56:05,780
Um...

4675
04:56:05,780 --> 04:56:07,900
That's Tom and Jerry's theme?

4676
04:56:08,540 --> 04:56:09,260
Oh...

4677
04:56:09,260 --> 04:56:09,960
Whatever.

4678
04:56:30,580 --> 04:56:31,300
Anyway...

4679
04:56:31,300 --> 04:56:33,400
Requires Juliana's key?

4680
04:56:34,100 --> 04:56:35,160
Bitch, get over here!

4681
04:56:38,510 --> 04:56:40,210
Oh, maybe I go over here.

4682
04:56:41,110 --> 04:56:41,510
Crap.

4683
04:56:50,650 --> 04:56:51,050
Oh!

4684
04:56:59,130 --> 04:57:00,110
Juliana is her friend.

4685
04:57:00,210 --> 04:57:03,410
Sorry, she keeps bringing her up, so I got the names confused.

4686
04:57:07,490 --> 04:57:07,890
Left?

4687
04:57:07,970 --> 04:57:08,690
There is a space?

4688
04:57:09,010 --> 04:57:09,490
There is?

4689
04:57:14,140 --> 04:57:14,540
Here?

4690
04:57:17,460 --> 04:57:18,300
Oops.

4691
04:57:22,180 --> 04:57:22,860
Here?

4692
04:57:24,400 --> 04:57:25,080
There?

4693
04:57:25,800 --> 04:57:26,380
Go up?

4694
04:57:26,660 --> 04:57:30,500
What do you mean?

4695
04:57:30,620 --> 04:57:31,420
Where up?

4696
04:57:40,710 --> 04:57:42,290
The white sheet?

4697
04:57:45,250 --> 04:57:46,990
This thing?

4698
04:57:50,910 --> 04:57:52,890
It blended in, you guys.

4699
04:57:52,990 --> 04:57:53,890
I thought it was...

4700
04:57:55,310 --> 04:57:56,810
It blended in.

4701
04:57:56,870 --> 04:57:59,790
I really thought it was its own thing.

4702
04:58:00,710 --> 04:58:02,170
Oh my god, we got a Pepe recipe.

4703
04:58:05,230 --> 04:58:07,230
400 grams spaghetti.

4704
04:58:07,850 --> 04:58:08,490
Peppercorns.

4705
04:58:08,850 --> 04:58:09,450
Pecorino.

4706
04:58:10,750 --> 04:58:11,150
Nice.

4707
04:58:11,150 --> 04:58:15,630
Where did my weapon go?

4708
04:58:15,730 --> 04:58:16,590
Okay, I still have it.

4709
04:58:16,690 --> 04:58:17,010
I think.

4710
04:58:17,910 --> 04:58:18,370
I sure hope.

4711
04:58:19,070 --> 04:58:19,450
Pepe.

4712
04:58:23,380 --> 04:58:24,520
This area is kind of spooky.

4713
04:58:26,260 --> 04:58:27,440
Is there anyone around here?

4714
04:58:30,040 --> 04:58:30,740
Maybe not.

4715
04:58:31,920 --> 04:58:33,100
Okay, I dropped down.

4716
04:58:33,560 --> 04:58:34,580
Alright, but what else is up here?

4717
04:58:35,240 --> 04:58:35,960
We got some bread.

4718
04:58:37,860 --> 04:58:40,180
I'm always... No, I didn't want to eat that!

4719
04:58:40,300 --> 04:58:41,180
I'm always eating bread.

4720
04:58:42,260 --> 04:58:44,060
I'm too fast at this game.

4721
04:58:44,580 --> 04:58:46,240
Can I get a...

4722
04:58:46,240 --> 04:58:49,180
Get a blessing for...

4723
04:58:50,520 --> 04:58:54,480
The fancy walnut and choco chip cookies that I got out of the oven.

4724
04:58:54,840 --> 04:58:56,060
That sounds amazing!

4725
04:58:56,160 --> 04:58:56,520
Thank you!

4726
04:58:56,920 --> 04:58:57,960
Please share.

4727
04:58:59,280 --> 04:59:00,080
Please share.

4728
04:59:00,220 --> 04:59:00,760
Thank you.

4729
04:59:03,820 --> 04:59:04,440
Blessing!

4730
04:59:04,520 --> 04:59:04,860
Blessing!

4731
04:59:06,540 --> 04:59:07,740
Be delicious!

4732
04:59:09,620 --> 04:59:10,220
Moe!

4733
04:59:10,220 --> 04:59:10,820
Moe!

4734
04:59:14,920 --> 04:59:17,720
I might have to possess you later though.

4735
04:59:18,220 --> 04:59:18,820
Sorry.

4736
04:59:24,960 --> 04:59:26,800
Can I tear this apart?

4737
04:59:26,940 --> 04:59:27,120
No.

4738
04:59:27,520 --> 04:59:27,960
I have to block.

4739
04:59:28,080 --> 04:59:28,220
Okay.

4740
04:59:29,000 --> 04:59:29,300
Easy.

4741
04:59:38,720 --> 04:59:40,700
Sounds like she was running away from something.

4742
04:59:43,800 --> 04:59:45,180
What are you doing?

4743
04:59:47,140 --> 04:59:48,780
Ma'am, what are you doing?

4744
04:59:49,420 --> 04:59:49,960
Come on.

4745
04:59:54,980 --> 04:59:56,740
Gina is kind of silly you guys.

4746
04:59:57,260 --> 04:59:58,280
I'm starting to realize.

4747
05:00:14,020 --> 05:00:15,740
She was going to come up you guys.

4748
05:00:16,180 --> 05:00:17,360
She was going to come up here.

4749
05:00:29,320 --> 05:00:30,740
We got him.

4750
05:00:32,640 --> 05:00:33,240
Easy.

4751
05:00:34,660 --> 05:00:35,500
Steal their stuff.

4752
05:00:35,940 --> 05:00:36,600
Take their things.

4753
05:00:36,860 --> 05:00:38,080
Take their meds.

4754
05:00:38,980 --> 05:00:40,040
Take your meds!

4755
05:00:43,300 --> 05:00:44,100
More money!

4756
05:00:44,880 --> 05:00:45,280
Nice.

4757
05:00:45,700 --> 05:00:47,340
You can never not have enough money, right?

4758
05:00:58,850 --> 05:01:00,170
Did she already go up?

4759
05:01:00,670 --> 05:01:01,450
She is so fast.

4760
05:01:06,690 --> 05:01:07,810
Girl, hold on!

4761
05:01:08,910 --> 05:01:09,950
There is double weight.

4762
05:01:10,030 --> 05:01:10,430
That's so fun.

4763
05:01:12,410 --> 05:01:12,990
Or is that her?

4764
05:01:14,890 --> 05:01:15,550
There she is.

4765
05:01:15,590 --> 05:01:15,950
Oh my god.

4766
05:01:16,430 --> 05:01:17,790
I thought I was seeing things for a second.

4767
05:01:17,790 --> 05:01:19,490
Wow, this is a nice room.

4768
05:01:21,150 --> 05:01:21,590
Anything?

4769
05:01:21,810 --> 05:01:22,470
Oh, meds in here.

4770
05:01:23,550 --> 05:01:24,190
Pills here.

4771
05:01:33,470 --> 05:01:34,770
Grab this just in case.

4772
05:01:41,010 --> 05:01:41,450
Lockpick!

4773
05:01:41,730 --> 05:01:42,170
Lockpick!

4774
05:01:50,250 --> 05:01:51,650
Lockpick.

4775
05:01:53,170 --> 05:01:55,010
To the Jones.

4776
05:01:55,330 --> 05:01:59,710
What about my weapon?

4777
05:02:05,410 --> 05:02:08,690
I think I got him.

4778
05:02:10,490 --> 05:02:11,530
Take your time.

4779
05:02:13,150 --> 05:02:14,270
Interrogation document.

4780
05:02:15,730 --> 05:02:17,270
He is just a cream puff.

4781
05:02:17,910 --> 05:02:20,790
Suspect Anon was found near Officer Rodolfo's body.

4782
05:02:20,950 --> 05:02:22,390
Claims to have found him already dead.

4783
05:02:22,770 --> 05:02:23,950
Suspect refuses to talk.

4784
05:02:24,050 --> 05:02:25,950
Clearly has previous interrogation experience.

4785
05:02:26,230 --> 05:02:27,570
Perhaps a communist spy?

4786
05:02:28,030 --> 05:02:31,590
She will break eventually and reveal her co-conspirators.

4787
05:02:32,030 --> 05:02:35,650
Need to inform Father Ventura that communist spies may have infiltrated the Vatican.

4788
05:02:42,360 --> 05:02:43,300
Take your time.

4789
05:02:43,620 --> 05:02:44,540
Oh, I'll help.

4790
05:02:45,020 --> 05:02:45,340
I guess.

4791
05:03:00,220 --> 05:03:02,120
It's so cute when he put it like that.

4792
05:03:02,120 --> 05:03:03,620
As all good men do.

4793
05:03:10,700 --> 05:03:11,660
Aww,

4794
05:03:15,400 --> 05:03:16,260
missing cat.

4795
05:03:29,040 --> 05:03:30,040
We are key.

4796
05:03:37,070 --> 05:03:38,150
We took care of everybody.

4797
05:03:38,230 --> 05:03:38,530
Don't worry.

4798
05:03:39,230 --> 05:03:39,750
Yeah, I know.

4799
05:03:39,910 --> 05:03:40,270
I did that.

4800
05:04:04,910 --> 05:04:06,390
That's how they took the picture of me.

4801
05:04:10,750 --> 05:04:11,550
Yeah, I already know.

4802
05:04:16,570 --> 05:04:17,530
Thank you.

4803
05:04:17,770 --> 05:04:19,490
Yeah, they spoiled which door it is.

4804
05:04:30,490 --> 05:04:30,970
Okay.

4805
05:04:32,430 --> 05:04:33,450
Wait, is that another?

4806
05:04:35,730 --> 05:04:37,350
Is that another side quest?

4807
05:04:41,450 --> 05:04:41,970
What?

4808
05:04:45,290 --> 05:04:45,810
What?

4809
05:04:49,850 --> 05:04:51,970
Why did he look at the camera and say that?

4810
05:04:54,390 --> 05:04:56,890
I don't know what you mean actually, Indy.

4811
05:04:57,610 --> 05:04:59,470
I actually really...

4812
05:04:59,470 --> 05:05:00,770
No, new mystery!

4813
05:05:03,090 --> 05:05:05,570
I don't know what he means by that at all.

4814
05:05:06,850 --> 05:05:08,130
Oh, look at that!

4815
05:05:08,530 --> 05:05:10,830
Wait, all the fieldwork is done.

4816
05:05:11,770 --> 05:05:12,970
Wasn't there one more?

4817
05:05:13,650 --> 05:05:14,470
Or am I crazy?

4818
05:05:17,930 --> 05:05:19,410
Find the locked door.

4819
05:05:24,030 --> 05:05:25,450
I'm an acrobat.

4820
05:05:28,130 --> 05:05:29,310
Oh, Indy.

4821
05:05:29,810 --> 05:05:30,670
You're so silly.

4822
05:05:33,150 --> 05:05:34,650
It's that one over there.

4823
05:05:39,170 --> 05:05:39,690
Yup.

4824
05:05:41,850 --> 05:05:45,630
I don't think I was going to make that one, but yeah, cool.

4825
05:05:54,650 --> 05:05:56,350
Why is that thing still there?

4826
05:05:59,250 --> 05:06:01,650
You think it would run out of fuel?

4827
05:06:01,890 --> 05:06:03,170
What does that thing run on?

4828
05:06:05,390 --> 05:06:06,270
Medicine bottles.

4829
05:06:06,650 --> 05:06:07,350
Take that.

4830
05:06:07,630 --> 05:06:09,590
That's of it's own value.

4831
05:06:12,130 --> 05:06:12,470
Okay.

4832
05:06:16,400 --> 05:06:17,880
Why does she have the key for this?

4833
05:06:21,260 --> 05:06:23,740
Search the agent's room.

4834
05:06:26,780 --> 05:06:27,760
Who's a good boy?

4835
05:06:28,660 --> 05:06:29,260
Who's a good boy?

4836
05:06:30,220 --> 05:06:31,160
Who's a good boy?

4837
05:06:31,900 --> 05:06:32,700
Who's a good boy?

4838
05:06:40,920 --> 05:06:43,080
I can't take a picture of you guys?

4839
05:06:44,560 --> 05:06:45,680
Oh my goodness!

4840
05:06:50,900 --> 05:06:52,380
Who's a good boy?

4841
05:06:53,220 --> 05:06:53,960
And a book.

4842
05:06:56,020 --> 05:06:58,260
Why does it have to be snakes?

4843
05:07:00,660 --> 05:07:01,280
Throttle.

4844
05:07:01,400 --> 05:07:04,540
Knock out unaware lightweight and medium weight enemies with a whip pull.

4845
05:07:04,900 --> 05:07:06,320
That sounds awesome.

4846
05:07:13,620 --> 05:07:15,240
Polybius Square Diagram.

4847
05:07:15,880 --> 05:07:18,500
Polybius Square used to construct and decode secret messages.

4848
05:07:20,020 --> 05:07:20,500
Mortis.

4849
05:07:28,970 --> 05:07:29,910
Are you okay?

4850
05:07:30,090 --> 05:07:31,610
The dog is really whimpering.

4851
05:07:31,770 --> 05:07:32,910
I'm worried for him.

4852
05:07:33,710 --> 05:07:34,430
Ah, here we go.

4853
05:07:35,370 --> 05:07:36,330
Italian poem.

4854
05:07:36,770 --> 05:07:38,510
I speak for God and not myself.

4855
05:07:42,400 --> 05:07:44,360
Some of the letters have been highlighted.

4856
05:07:45,160 --> 05:07:47,380
The dim and wasteful that was pure and bright.

4857
05:07:47,500 --> 05:07:48,740
He observes us all.

4858
05:07:48,880 --> 05:07:49,900
I'll look to him.

4859
05:07:50,100 --> 05:07:51,020
To sin is human.

4860
05:07:51,140 --> 05:07:52,020
To watch divine.

4861
05:07:52,500 --> 05:07:53,760
Some of the letters have been highlighted.

4862
05:07:53,760 --> 05:07:54,160
Okay.

4863
05:07:54,760 --> 05:07:59,520
I-R-I-A-T-A-S-A

4864
05:08:13,140 --> 05:08:14,400
The last one is an O?

4865
05:08:15,300 --> 05:08:16,060
Are you sure?

4866
05:08:21,660 --> 05:08:22,860
Two out of six?

4867
05:08:23,640 --> 05:08:26,860
This place looks like a center for some kind of secret operation.

4868
05:08:26,980 --> 05:08:29,700
Perhaps there is useful information to be found regarding the cat mummy.

4869
05:08:30,520 --> 05:08:31,340
Are you sure?

4870
05:08:31,460 --> 05:08:32,800
It looks just like an A.

4871
05:08:32,880 --> 05:08:33,460
Are you sure?

4872
05:08:37,880 --> 05:08:39,140
Okay.

4873
05:08:39,800 --> 05:08:42,460
I-R-I...

4874
05:08:46,710 --> 05:08:47,270
Huh?

4875
05:08:57,230 --> 05:08:57,310
I

4876
05:09:05,400 --> 05:09:07,440
-R?

4877
05:09:09,480 --> 05:09:12,180
So I-R is five.

4878
05:09:13,860 --> 05:09:21,680
I-R-I-A I-R-I-A So 5-I-A 5-8

4879
05:09:26,140 --> 05:09:37,900
T -A 5-8 7 5-8-7 S... I'm gonna trust you guys.

4880
05:09:37,980 --> 05:09:38,560
S-O

4881
05:09:42,050 --> 05:09:44,510
3 Wait.

4882
05:09:44,650 --> 05:09:46,210
5-8-7-3?

4883
05:09:48,670 --> 05:09:49,290
I think?

4884
05:10:02,820 --> 05:10:03,500
Okay.

4885
05:10:05,080 --> 05:10:05,780
There is a lot in here.

4886
05:10:06,840 --> 05:10:07,680
Siwa photograph.

4887
05:10:08,160 --> 05:10:10,100
Captured after discovering the cat mummy in Siwa.

4888
05:10:15,320 --> 05:10:16,540
Junior report!

4889
05:10:18,140 --> 05:10:20,760
Henry Walton Jones, Jr.

4890
05:10:25,120 --> 05:10:26,020
Henry.

4891
05:10:39,680 --> 05:10:40,040
Yeah!

4892
05:10:44,920 --> 05:10:47,180
I guess his middle name is Walton.

4893
05:10:50,380 --> 05:10:50,920
Recommendation.

4894
05:10:51,080 --> 05:10:52,260
Continued surveillance.

4895
05:10:52,580 --> 05:10:55,280
Subject seems to have a meddlesome personality.

4896
05:10:55,720 --> 05:11:00,040
The orders operation in America left behind traces which led the subject to the Vatican.

4897
05:11:00,480 --> 05:11:05,700
We do not know his full intentions yet and should not intervene directly with the subject for risk of attracting unwanted attention.

4898
05:11:06,240 --> 05:11:06,700
End report.

4899
05:11:12,710 --> 05:11:14,490
No, they're gonna hurt Antonio.

4900
05:11:15,890 --> 05:11:17,130
Let's see here.

4901
05:11:18,830 --> 05:11:19,450
Mission goal.

4902
05:11:19,830 --> 05:11:23,870
Investigate possible connection between the subject's research and his son's excavation in Siwa.

4903
05:11:24,050 --> 05:11:25,050
Status resolved.

4904
05:11:25,930 --> 05:11:26,230
Oh!

4905
05:11:26,390 --> 05:11:38,730
Henry Walton Jones, Sr. After months of on-site surveillance, our operatives have found nothing in the subject's research on the Holy Grail, which could lead to a discovery related to the Reclamation Project.

4906
05:11:39,510 --> 05:11:44,750
Furthermore, our own research has found nothing about the Holy Grail that would tie it to the Reclamation Project.

4907
05:11:45,110 --> 05:11:52,430
Subject and his son have also been estranged for many years and because of this, we believe it is unlikely that they would be working together.

4908
05:11:52,790 --> 05:11:58,350
Their relative proximity to theologically sensitive materials is merely a coincidence of them working in similar fields.

4909
05:12:00,830 --> 05:12:01,910
What the hell?

4910
05:12:07,080 --> 05:12:07,600
Pup.

4911
05:12:07,600 --> 05:12:08,120
Cat.

4912
05:12:09,540 --> 05:12:10,060
Pooool.

4913
05:12:11,980 --> 05:12:12,500
Alrighty.

4914
05:12:15,500 --> 05:12:16,980
Um, well we did that.

4915
05:12:19,480 --> 05:12:20,680
Cat, dog, pig.

4916
05:12:21,440 --> 05:12:22,980
I don't think it gets me anything though.

4917
05:12:26,860 --> 05:12:27,380
Throttle.

4918
05:12:28,320 --> 05:12:29,640
Oh wow, I have so many points!

4919
05:12:30,940 --> 05:12:33,480
Knock out unaware with a whip pull.

4920
05:12:33,660 --> 05:12:34,360
Let's try it.

4921
05:12:34,360 --> 05:12:36,060
I like to use my whip on them.

4922
05:12:38,460 --> 05:12:38,820
Nice.

4923
05:12:39,600 --> 05:12:40,420
8-Bit Romance!

4924
05:12:40,760 --> 05:12:43,080
It's my birthday and I'm glad to end it off with your stream.

4925
05:12:43,180 --> 05:12:44,620
Thank you for your amazing year of fun and cheer.

4926
05:12:44,740 --> 05:12:45,660
Congrats on all your achievements.

4927
05:12:46,080 --> 05:12:47,440
May the next one be filled with many more.

4928
05:12:48,180 --> 05:12:48,740
Thank you!

4929
05:12:52,900 --> 05:12:55,300
Happy birthday to you.

4930
05:12:55,920 --> 05:12:58,640
Happy birthday to you.

4931
05:12:59,180 --> 05:13:02,260
Happy birthday 8-Bit Romance.

4932
05:13:03,900 --> 05:13:07,500
Happy birthday to you.

4933
05:13:09,400 --> 05:13:10,620
Happy birthday!

4934
05:13:13,180 --> 05:13:14,020
Yay.

4935
05:13:15,640 --> 05:13:17,560
Alrighty, guys.

4936
05:13:18,540 --> 05:13:20,200
So we've done all the field work.

4937
05:13:21,040 --> 05:13:23,580
We've gotten the memories, or the mysteries.

4938
05:13:28,990 --> 05:13:31,310
Find ancient relics in the Vatican.

4939
05:13:32,670 --> 05:13:34,690
Lost artifacts of Europe.

4940
05:13:37,570 --> 05:13:39,510
Oh yeah, I got that.

4941
05:13:40,190 --> 05:13:41,590
Find medicine bottles.

4942
05:13:43,070 --> 05:13:44,310
And field notes.

4943
05:13:46,150 --> 05:13:48,750
Wow, there's so much!

4944
05:13:49,030 --> 05:13:51,270
Wait, so these are all the things that I didn't complete?

4945
05:13:51,390 --> 05:13:52,110
That's crazy!

4946
05:13:54,030 --> 05:13:55,690
But I did the field work.

4947
05:13:56,350 --> 05:13:58,570
And then we can continue the adventure.

4948
05:14:03,310 --> 05:14:04,670
Next time we play.

4949
05:14:05,090 --> 05:14:07,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4950
05:14:07,930 --> 05:14:10,690
I don't think, like I said, I'm not planning on 100%ing the game.

4951
05:14:10,810 --> 05:14:14,770
So I probably will not get all of this.

4952
05:14:15,110 --> 05:14:15,690
But that's okay.

4953
05:14:17,730 --> 05:14:21,790
So I do want to continue on with the stolen cat mummy.

4954
05:14:23,530 --> 05:14:24,990
Those are like collectibles.

4955
05:14:25,070 --> 05:14:26,390
You can come back later if you wanted to.

4956
05:14:26,670 --> 05:14:27,690
Yeah, I think so.

4957
05:14:28,830 --> 05:14:30,030
Surprisingly big game.

4958
05:14:30,330 --> 05:14:33,310
I mean, for the price, it better be.

4959
05:14:33,850 --> 05:14:35,850
I mean, luckily, I'm using Game Pass.

4960
05:14:39,650 --> 05:14:40,170
Interesting.

4961
05:14:42,310 --> 05:14:43,930
Wait, where does this lead even?

4962
05:14:44,190 --> 05:14:44,770
What the hell?

4963
05:14:48,710 --> 05:14:53,010
Yeah, I got it on Game Pass, so...

4964
05:14:53,010 --> 05:14:56,950
But still, for the price, it should be a good amount of stuff.

4965
05:14:57,430 --> 05:15:01,010
Yeah, thank you guys for joining me for more Indiana Jones.

4966
05:15:01,530 --> 05:15:04,690
I want to finish it before I leave.

4967
05:15:05,630 --> 05:15:06,410
For Japan.

4968
05:15:07,490 --> 05:15:08,370
Hot dog!

4969
05:15:10,650 --> 05:15:12,350
I finally have my ATL.

4970
05:15:12,590 --> 05:15:14,370
I'd like to thank you and Doki again for the concert.

4971
05:15:14,490 --> 05:15:17,490
I'm 100% being real that it's the best VTuber concert I've been.

4972
05:15:18,310 --> 05:15:18,970
Thank you.

4973
05:15:19,090 --> 05:15:22,470
Between all the performers, the setlist, and the crowd's energy, it's been a vibe.

4974
05:15:22,590 --> 05:15:23,410
Thank you!

4975
05:15:25,290 --> 05:15:26,330
Happy, happy.

4976
05:15:26,790 --> 05:15:27,910
Thank you so much.

4977
05:15:27,950 --> 05:15:28,570
I really appreciate it.

4978
05:15:28,610 --> 05:15:29,510
I'm glad you got back safe.

4979
05:15:32,470 --> 05:15:36,850
I got a poster of you and Froggy Wawa from the artist alley.

4980
05:15:41,750 --> 05:15:42,550
Froggy Wawa.

4981
05:15:42,550 --> 05:15:46,170
Bento, please play MG...

4982
05:15:47,450 --> 05:15:50,550
MG Survive is the best play...

4983
05:15:51,130 --> 05:15:51,410
Oh!

4984
05:15:51,970 --> 05:15:57,550
Survive is the best police special gear game.

4985
05:15:57,890 --> 05:15:59,090
Please play the title.

4986
05:15:59,650 --> 05:16:02,750
Bento, MGR is bad.

4987
05:16:03,430 --> 05:16:06,310
Please don't play the game I like.

4988
05:16:07,690 --> 05:16:10,770
Oh, expert.

4989
05:16:10,770 --> 05:16:12,090
Thank you.

4990
05:16:14,090 --> 05:16:16,410
DMC2 meme, but MG Survive.

4991
05:16:16,810 --> 05:16:17,530
Yeah, I know.

4992
05:16:19,010 --> 05:16:23,350
Actually, I want to play MG Survive.

4993
05:16:23,910 --> 05:16:26,770
One of the guys from the...

4994
05:16:30,010 --> 05:16:31,090
Kojima Frequency.

4995
05:16:31,370 --> 05:16:33,890
He actually really likes MG Survive.

4996
05:16:34,370 --> 05:16:35,170
His name is Fingers.

4997
05:16:35,310 --> 05:16:37,770
He's the one who helped me with my...

4998
05:16:37,770 --> 05:16:41,250
With music for Freak or Treat.

4999
05:16:44,650 --> 05:16:49,690
I wanted to play with him and Barry and Maddy.

5000
05:16:49,830 --> 05:16:50,710
Oh, that's Raspberry.

5001
05:16:52,390 --> 05:16:54,730
He did the DJ set at MGS Con as well.

5002
05:16:56,540 --> 05:16:57,990
His name is Fingers.

5003
05:16:58,250 --> 05:17:00,210
I mean, that's his handle.

5004
05:17:02,750 --> 05:17:08,110
But I was thinking he could lead us since he knows a lot about the game.

5005
05:17:08,290 --> 05:17:12,280
And then we could do like a fun, you know, collab together.

5006
05:17:13,090 --> 05:17:16,030
I asked Maddy and she said she would be down for it.

5007
05:17:16,110 --> 05:17:19,350
I did not ask Fingers and I didn't ask Barry.

5008
05:17:20,110 --> 05:17:23,430
But I think they'd be okay with it, probably.

5009
05:17:24,370 --> 05:17:26,450
My ace combat figure from Japan, by the way.

5010
05:17:26,890 --> 05:17:27,870
It's kind of messy and broken.

5011
05:17:28,610 --> 05:17:29,930
So I hope you don't mind.

5012
05:17:29,930 --> 05:17:30,870
What do you mean?

5013
05:17:33,310 --> 05:17:36,790
Don't give me your precious ace combat stuff, Nan.

5014
05:17:41,030 --> 05:17:42,670
But yeah, Maddy.

5015
05:17:42,790 --> 05:17:43,190
I know!

5016
05:17:43,450 --> 05:17:45,610
I've always wanted to collab with Maddy.

5017
05:17:48,270 --> 05:17:51,890
Have you seen the new version of Solid Snake MGS2 figure?

5018
05:17:52,170 --> 05:17:52,950
I have!

5019
05:17:53,310 --> 05:17:55,130
Yes, I pre-ordered it this morning.

5020
05:17:55,670 --> 05:17:57,250
Lots of people tagged me in it.

5021
05:17:57,250 --> 05:17:58,550
So, thank you everybody.

5022
05:17:58,790 --> 05:17:59,650
Thank you, thank you.

5023
05:18:01,790 --> 05:18:03,150
Barry will probably be down.

5024
05:18:03,590 --> 05:18:04,110
Probably.

5025
05:18:05,270 --> 05:18:08,530
I was just like, who's a bunch of Metal Gear people that I can gather together?

5026
05:18:08,910 --> 05:18:13,710
I don't think Maddy has played Survive and I know Barry hasn't played Survive.

5027
05:18:13,870 --> 05:18:15,590
So, congratulations for the wonderful concert.

5028
05:18:16,370 --> 05:18:21,230
MinkyFuss2024 Thank you, Arararararararagi-san.

5029
05:18:23,690 --> 05:18:25,530
Oh, thanks Ghost Orb.

5030
05:18:26,050 --> 05:18:29,090
Yeah, Fingers did some pretty cool remixes.

5031
05:18:36,160 --> 05:18:38,220
I just want to share what it looks like.

5032
05:18:38,300 --> 05:18:38,660
Oh, okay.

5033
05:18:38,840 --> 05:18:41,020
I was gonna say, don't give me that.

5034
05:18:41,200 --> 05:18:43,240
Well, earlier you talked about gifting me something.

5035
05:18:43,420 --> 05:18:47,760
So, that's why I was like, don't give me your stuff.

5036
05:18:48,280 --> 05:18:49,360
Your ace combat stuff.

5037
05:18:50,680 --> 05:18:51,120
Mitchisway!

5038
05:18:51,800 --> 05:18:53,260
Thanks for 7 months!

5039
05:18:53,260 --> 05:18:56,260
Thank you.

5040
05:18:58,280 --> 05:18:59,120
Good night, Minky.

5041
05:18:59,280 --> 05:18:59,900
Thanks for the stream.

5042
05:19:00,020 --> 05:19:01,020
Good night, JMaxx.

5043
05:19:09,740 --> 05:19:11,640
I don't remember what else I was gonna say.

5044
05:19:12,080 --> 05:19:13,640
Was he the one who DJed for MGSCon 2?

5045
05:19:13,820 --> 05:19:14,040
Yeah!

5046
05:19:17,140 --> 05:19:18,180
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

5047
05:19:19,300 --> 05:19:19,940
So...

5048
05:19:20,800 --> 05:19:23,140
Yeah, I think the game...

5049
05:19:23,140 --> 05:19:24,460
Where's the save point?

5050
05:19:24,600 --> 05:19:28,180
I think I need to get to a save...

5051
05:19:30,320 --> 05:19:32,520
Before I just quit the game.

5052
05:19:32,560 --> 05:19:35,680
I know it saved after I did what I did, but...

5053
05:19:35,680 --> 05:19:36,980
I'm trapped.

5054
05:19:41,220 --> 05:19:41,860
We

5055
05:19:59,940 --> 05:20:01,940
were so close.

5056
05:20:03,200 --> 05:20:07,360
Oh my god, creating a second hole in Indiana Jones.

5057
05:20:19,100 --> 05:20:20,220
Where's the save point?

5058
05:20:24,240 --> 05:20:25,420
Where's the save point?

5059
05:20:27,300 --> 05:20:28,780
Thank you guys for the superchats.

5060
05:20:28,800 --> 05:20:30,620
Hold on, I'll read them in like 2 seconds.

5061
05:20:30,780 --> 05:20:32,880
Once I can get out of here.

5062
05:20:33,900 --> 05:20:35,480
Restricted, but I'm in an outfit.

5063
05:20:37,680 --> 05:20:38,700
But I'm in uniform.

5064
05:20:40,920 --> 05:20:42,690
It didn't turn red, but...

5065
05:20:43,300 --> 05:20:44,700
Hold on, I'm just trying to save my game.

5066
05:20:44,960 --> 05:20:46,640
You guys, I'm just trying to save my game.

5067
05:20:48,420 --> 05:20:49,560
Fast travel to save.

5068
05:20:49,660 --> 05:20:50,360
Let's try it.

5069
05:20:54,900 --> 05:20:55,360
Nothing.

5070
05:21:02,260 --> 05:21:03,300
Oh, it just saved.

5071
05:21:03,480 --> 05:21:03,720
Perfect.

5072
05:21:05,580 --> 05:21:06,040
Ok.

5073
05:21:07,060 --> 05:21:07,440
Yay!

5074
05:21:09,840 --> 05:21:11,300
What was that noise?

5075
05:21:13,000 --> 05:21:15,540
Just remember, MGS Survive campaign is single player.

5076
05:21:15,920 --> 05:21:18,060
The base defense missions are co-op.

5077
05:21:18,160 --> 05:21:20,260
I suggest playing the campaign a little bit before co-op.

5078
05:21:21,200 --> 05:21:22,420
Thank you, Rendog.

5079
05:21:22,680 --> 05:21:23,640
I didn't know that actually.

5080
05:21:24,380 --> 05:21:25,380
Oh, the game case cover.

5081
05:21:25,640 --> 05:21:26,220
That's right.

5082
05:21:26,300 --> 05:21:26,780
Thank you.

5083
05:21:26,920 --> 05:21:27,440
Yes, that's right.

5084
05:21:27,480 --> 05:21:28,160
You did tell me that.

5085
05:21:28,860 --> 05:21:30,920
All I want for Christmas is an eyepatch.

5086
05:21:31,600 --> 05:21:32,940
Like my eyepatch?

5087
05:21:34,220 --> 05:21:34,960
This one?

5088
05:21:35,520 --> 05:21:35,860
Next!

5089
05:21:36,120 --> 05:21:36,880
Thanks for the pick!

5090
05:21:36,880 --> 05:21:37,840
Really love the concert.

5091
05:21:37,940 --> 05:21:41,100
It was awesome being surrounded by fellow fans wearing Doki and Mint and Phantom Thief hoppies.

5092
05:21:41,320 --> 05:21:42,360
All cheering for you and Doki.

5093
05:21:42,460 --> 05:21:44,280
I'm so proud of how far you both got.

5094
05:21:44,820 --> 05:21:45,800
Thank you!

5095
05:21:46,760 --> 05:21:47,760
Thank you!

5096
05:21:50,660 --> 05:21:51,740
Yeah, I...

5097
05:21:51,740 --> 05:21:55,460
I'm really happy with how it turned out.

5098
05:21:56,380 --> 05:21:58,900
And how much it seemed everybody enjoyed it.

5099
05:22:00,280 --> 05:22:00,820
So...

5100
05:22:01,880 --> 05:22:04,960
Big things are in the works.

5101
05:22:04,960 --> 05:22:10,080
So, you know, hopefully in the future I can do more concerts.

5102
05:22:10,400 --> 05:22:15,920
And, you know, that's also really cool because so many people kind of get the...

5103
05:22:15,920 --> 05:22:17,620
You know, I love idols so much.

5104
05:22:17,700 --> 05:22:19,200
I love idol culture so much.

5105
05:22:19,660 --> 05:22:21,680
Otagi and doing mix and everything.

5106
05:22:22,060 --> 05:22:27,960
And, you know, sometimes at concerts, like, you know, like...

5107
05:22:29,100 --> 05:22:33,780
Even at like anime conventions, like when a group comes over or something.

5108
05:22:33,780 --> 05:22:36,920
Not everybody really knows what to do.

5109
05:22:37,400 --> 05:22:41,320
And so it's kind of really fun to see how many more people are being exposed to...

5110
05:22:42,680 --> 05:22:45,740
You know, the culture that I've grown up with.

5111
05:22:48,020 --> 05:22:49,840
So it's really, really awesome.

5112
05:22:51,260 --> 05:22:52,640
And fun learning.

5113
05:22:52,820 --> 05:22:53,240
Yeah!

5114
05:22:55,060 --> 05:22:56,880
So, we pick up as we go.

5115
05:22:57,000 --> 05:23:00,020
You know, as long as you're having fun, that's all there is to it, you know.

5116
05:23:01,060 --> 05:23:04,920
It's so fun to be able to go to an idol live and be like...

5117
05:23:04,920 --> 05:23:08,520
That's my Oshi and I'm gonna Oshi jump and I'm gonna do calls for her.

5118
05:23:10,280 --> 05:23:12,060
I want her to hear my voice.

5119
05:23:13,500 --> 05:23:17,240
And feel me giving her so much energy, you know.

5120
05:23:19,280 --> 05:23:20,480
It's always fun with Minki.

5121
05:23:20,740 --> 05:23:22,000
I'm glad you think so!

5122
05:23:22,500 --> 05:23:23,160
Thank you!

5123
05:23:24,640 --> 05:23:25,500
Yeah, yeah.

5124
05:23:25,500 --> 05:23:28,480
I went to many Otage panels at AWA because of you.

5125
05:23:30,000 --> 05:23:34,220
It's funny, like, back long, long ago I used to host my own Otage panels.

5126
05:23:35,060 --> 05:23:38,460
And I would get, I don't know, I would get like...

5127
05:23:38,460 --> 05:23:42,980
Sometimes I would get a decent number, but usually it would be like 5, 10 people.

5128
05:23:45,420 --> 05:23:51,020
So, it's kind of crazy how many people have now gotten into it.

5129
05:23:54,320 --> 05:23:55,960
Now the whole room is filled.

5130
05:23:56,040 --> 05:23:56,720
I know, right?

5131
05:23:57,240 --> 05:23:58,860
You inspired so many people to join in.

5132
05:23:59,900 --> 05:24:02,400
Wait, did you change your profile picture?

5133
05:24:03,540 --> 05:24:04,260
Is that you, Yuko?

5134
05:24:05,240 --> 05:24:08,820
I'm really bad at remembering things, so I do my best to learn calls in Otage so I can cheer you on.

5135
05:24:09,120 --> 05:24:09,820
It's all good!

5136
05:24:10,200 --> 05:24:12,340
It can get so complicated too.

5137
05:24:12,600 --> 05:24:15,620
You know, even if you just know, like, standard mix.

5138
05:24:16,740 --> 05:24:19,980
You know, you can still feel like you can join in.

5139
05:24:19,980 --> 05:24:25,000
And when you know when to go, oh, hi, when you know when to p-p-p-h, things like that.

5140
05:24:26,260 --> 05:24:28,260
It's all, you know...

5141
05:24:29,340 --> 05:24:31,200
It's all very formulaic.

5142
05:24:31,400 --> 05:24:37,580
Once you know how to do the basics, you can do it to any song, basically.

5143
05:24:39,780 --> 05:24:40,620
It's very easy.

5144
05:24:40,820 --> 05:24:47,340
I'll try and do, like, Otage mix and stream sometime for people.

5145
05:24:47,340 --> 05:24:49,280
Because it can be...

5146
05:24:49,860 --> 05:24:53,340
It's all, you know, it can be intimidating, but...

5147
05:24:55,340 --> 05:24:57,460
Nani and Ko are inventing new mixes too.

5148
05:24:58,460 --> 05:25:00,080
That's how when you know you're in deep.

5149
05:25:00,300 --> 05:25:02,500
I used to do that, so...

5150
05:25:02,500 --> 05:25:08,020
And I sometimes see the mixes that I've invented, like, passed around sometimes.

5151
05:25:08,300 --> 05:25:10,820
And I'm just like, oh, I made that.

5152
05:25:12,000 --> 05:25:13,840
But I don't think anybody knows.

5153
05:25:17,580 --> 05:25:19,620
Nevermind, I did, I made that.

5154
05:25:22,800 --> 05:25:24,280
I won't tell you what, though.

5155
05:25:25,080 --> 05:25:26,000
I won't tell you what.

5156
05:25:26,200 --> 05:25:29,040
Reminded me all over again why I love live music so much.

5157
05:25:29,440 --> 05:25:31,480
Thanks for helping us discover and rediscover the magic.

5158
05:25:32,180 --> 05:25:37,100
Yeah, I mean, maybe it feels a little different just because, you know, it's not a band.

5159
05:25:37,800 --> 05:25:41,700
We're on a screen, but hopefully I would love to perform with a live band someday.

5160
05:25:41,700 --> 05:25:46,160
Let me change profile picture, but it looks the same.

5161
05:25:46,260 --> 05:25:47,640
I can't even tell what it is, Nani.

5162
05:25:50,530 --> 05:25:51,150
Who is that?

5163
05:25:51,550 --> 05:25:52,210
Thanks for concert.

5164
05:25:52,430 --> 05:25:54,070
Thanks, Peter Techovs!

5165
05:25:54,970 --> 05:25:55,990
Concert was exceptional.

5166
05:25:57,070 --> 05:25:57,510
Doobie...

5167
05:25:57,970 --> 05:25:59,190
Kingo on stage.

5168
05:26:00,430 --> 05:26:02,910
Brought one of my best friends to tears.

5169
05:26:03,010 --> 05:26:05,910
Thank you for putting it all together and assembling such an all-star cast.

5170
05:26:06,330 --> 05:26:06,530
Yeah!

5171
05:26:07,670 --> 05:26:08,550
Thank you.

5172
05:26:11,270 --> 05:26:12,570
Live band Minto.

5173
05:26:13,330 --> 05:26:14,250
Maybe one day.

5174
05:26:14,650 --> 05:26:16,470
I'll work hard to get there.

5175
05:26:17,670 --> 05:26:18,350
Did you see?

5176
05:26:18,710 --> 05:26:21,170
Kiara wants to be my white girl.

5177
05:26:22,730 --> 05:26:25,330
Okay, you guys have to make her dreams come true then, okay?

5178
05:26:25,950 --> 05:26:27,350
Thank you!

5179
05:26:28,930 --> 05:26:30,850
Yeah, guys have to make her dreams come true.

5180
05:26:32,830 --> 05:26:33,910
It's the chant to all-star.

5181
05:26:36,510 --> 05:26:38,050
Live band like Miku concerts?

5182
05:26:38,050 --> 05:26:38,670
Yeah!

5183
05:26:40,170 --> 05:26:41,390
Something like that.

5184
05:26:42,610 --> 05:26:45,710
I'm really inspired by a duo named Hime Hina.

5185
05:26:46,550 --> 05:26:48,490
One thing though...

5186
05:26:48,490 --> 05:26:51,970
One thing that got me so thinking about the concert is...

5187
05:26:51,970 --> 05:26:54,570
When I would dance with Doki, it would be so much fun.

5188
05:26:55,010 --> 05:26:56,570
When I would dance and sing with her, you know?

5189
05:26:57,350 --> 05:27:00,970
It made me just really miss that.

5190
05:27:01,450 --> 05:27:03,110
I was just thinking like...

5191
05:27:03,110 --> 05:27:07,070
I wish I could have my own dedicated group again, you know?

5192
05:27:07,070 --> 05:27:09,070
Kind of feeling...

5193
05:27:10,390 --> 05:27:12,770
I've been thinking about it a little bit recently.

5194
05:27:17,390 --> 05:27:19,910
But yeah, look up Hime Hina concerts.

5195
05:27:20,110 --> 05:27:20,810
They're so great.

5196
05:27:21,270 --> 05:27:23,350
Especially when they have the live band and everything.

5197
05:27:27,600 --> 05:27:28,540
I don't know.

5198
05:27:31,860 --> 05:27:33,800
You and Doki had great chemistry on stage.

5199
05:27:34,180 --> 05:27:36,400
I doubt she would want to be...

5200
05:27:37,080 --> 05:27:39,400
I doubt she would want to be...

5201
05:27:42,780 --> 05:27:43,400
As...

5202
05:27:44,060 --> 05:27:46,080
As intensive as I would want to be.

5203
05:27:50,310 --> 05:27:54,810
I apologize to Vito and Everywisp for the super chat earlier.

5204
05:27:56,130 --> 05:27:56,390
Yes.

5205
05:27:57,050 --> 05:27:57,670
Bread...

5206
05:27:57,670 --> 05:28:00,610
Sorry, X-Bread, please go take a nap.

5207
05:28:03,230 --> 05:28:04,930
Mint Doki dedicated group.

5208
05:28:08,360 --> 05:28:10,940
That's Sam from Death Stranding holding JPEG dog.

5209
05:28:11,120 --> 05:28:12,060
Oh my god.

5210
05:28:12,260 --> 05:28:13,620
Oh, I see it now.

5211
05:28:14,200 --> 05:28:15,680
How do you find these things?

5212
05:28:17,440 --> 05:28:19,780
Minto singing Snake Eater with a live band when...

5213
05:28:24,750 --> 05:28:25,870
You're the real deal.

5214
05:28:26,190 --> 05:28:26,770
I'm not.

5215
05:28:27,390 --> 05:28:28,130
I'm not.

5216
05:28:29,830 --> 05:28:30,710
I'm not.

5217
05:28:32,790 --> 05:28:33,710
It's okay though.

5218
05:28:33,770 --> 05:28:35,730
I'll do my best to maybe get there one day.

5219
05:28:37,330 --> 05:28:37,770
Okay!

5220
05:28:38,870 --> 05:28:39,310
Okay!

5221
05:28:39,710 --> 05:28:40,050
Okay!

5222
05:28:40,430 --> 05:28:42,410
I will see you guys...

5223
05:28:42,410 --> 05:28:44,590
When I see you next!

5224
05:28:44,710 --> 05:28:46,350
Sorry, I will have a schedule up.

5225
05:28:46,710 --> 05:28:49,310
If you're watching the VOD, there will probably be a schedule up.

5226
05:28:49,570 --> 05:28:50,390
But I'll have a schedule up.

5227
05:28:50,670 --> 05:28:51,450
Thank you guys!

5228
05:28:53,910 --> 05:28:55,170
Bye bye everybody!

5229
05:28:56,170 --> 05:28:57,430
Bye bye bye bye bye bye!

5230
05:28:57,650 --> 05:28:58,590
Bye bye bye bye bye!

5231
05:28:58,910 --> 05:28:59,350
Bye!
