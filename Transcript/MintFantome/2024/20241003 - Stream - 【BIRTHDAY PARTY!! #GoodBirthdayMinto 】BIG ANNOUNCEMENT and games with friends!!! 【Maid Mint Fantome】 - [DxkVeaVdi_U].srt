00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,870
Hello everybody!

2
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,850
And welcome to We Are Virgin!

3
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,380
A millionaire today!

4
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,520
Oh wait, wrong show, sorry.

5
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,680
You could be a millionaire if you win enough money!

6
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,740
It's time to family feud!

7
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,480
Wait, it's another wrong show, sorry.

8
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,260
There is no family in feuding.

9
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,000
What's the most money someone has won in Wheel of Fortune before?

10
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,000
Should be a million, right?

11
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,880
We'll find out today!

12
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,900
Yes, we have.

13
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,680
Actually, we'll introduce everybody starting from the pink one.

14
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,820
Hello everybody!

15
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,800
I am Muchawa and today I'm very cute.

16
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,640
I'm excited to be here.

17
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,040
And if you like Minto, please donate generously.

18
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,260
Because she will be giving the money to us as a prize.

19
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:47,940
Yippee!

20
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,920
This is the character you chose?

21
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,700
Listen!

22
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,300
I have to be cute.

23
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,640
I don't know how to be cute.

24
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,500
God damn it, I'm doing my best.

25
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,080
I'm really freaking dry in here, girl.

26
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,480
I feel like I should change some of the... I'm gonna change the names actually.

27
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,500
But if we have to do voices, what on earth would the voice be for a crow?

28
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,840
Oh no, it's just me.

29
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,820
Ah!

30
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:13,820
Ah!

31
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,400
Oh, just...

32
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,200
I'm like AHHHHH!

33
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,520
AHHHHH!

34
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,100
AHHHHH!

35
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,720
AHHHHH!

36
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,160
Why does it fit so fast?

37
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,620
AHHHHH!

38
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,260
Hello, it is iCrowKey.

39
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,760
I'm here to win some big money right now.

40
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,680
We're not late because of me, by the way.

41
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,160
We were...

42
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,500
Oh yeah, totally not.

43
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,660
It wasn't because of me!

44
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,240
I swear!

45
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,220
Girl, I just thought it'd be funny!

46
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,040
She had to commit to the bit, everybody.

47
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,780
And last but not least...

48
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,200
Hello, my name is Lamont.

49
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,240
No, it's Limes.

50
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,140
I'm here today...

51
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,980
Lamont?

52
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,680
My mascot's name is Lamont!

53
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,020
No, I am using Lamont today because I don't have a chibi version of my model.

54
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,640
And my normal model was really fat and was causing problems.

55
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,180
He's erotically chubby!

56
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,120
Stop it!

57
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,200
Fat isn't layer fat!

58
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,280
Layer fat!

59
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,280
Yeah.

60
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:19,940
Damn.

61
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,720
Should I show what happened?

62
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,620
Are you guys okay with that?

63
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,760
Yeah, show what happened, why we're...

64
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,620
Before you do, Koki, can you open your mouth?

65
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,120
Okay, yeah, don't worry, I'm dying a little bit.

66
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,940
We'll catch up soon, don't worry!

67
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,600
Oh, it's a little... you guys, today...

68
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,220
Really scuffed!

69
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,380
Wait, can I reshare?

70
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,580
Maybe it's because I'm 1440p right now, maybe that...

71
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,300
Oh, wait, hold on, I'm trying to save the pictures.

72
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,480
Let me change, I'm on 1440p, I'm too high quality.

73
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,560
Oh, you're back, you're back!

74
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,820
Okay, open your mouth, open your mouth.

75
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,340
Oh my god.

76
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,660
I think that'll work, hopefully it works.

77
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,920
Like this.

78
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,540
Hopefully, you don't say stop for anything.

79
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,040
Wait, should I reshare so I'm not 1440p?

80
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,020
No!

81
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,160
Would that be easier?

82
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:20,840
It's okay!

83
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,860
Because I'm talking right now, but I'm not moving.

84
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,220
Every now and again, it just looks like you're really good at sitting still at the same time.

85
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,020
It's really impressive.

86
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,620
No, I think it's Discord.

87
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,220
Or rather, I think it's the window share.

88
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:36,840
Okay.

89
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,560
I think I have to...

90
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,640
Do you want to disable it?

91
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,860
Oh, is it because you're not focusing the window share?

92
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,460
And it's like...

93
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,620
Yeah, I think that's it.

94
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,840
So I think how it is right now should be keeping good.

95
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,200
Okay, that's good.

96
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,940
I thought it was because I was too HD croaky.

97
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,320
My computer is chugging.

98
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,520
You guys, so I started a collab room in a VTube studio for everybody to join.

99
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,240
And Matara first comes in like this.

100
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,780
When I'm open, when I'm sleeping.

101
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,480
And then we have...

102
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,720
What is...

103
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,840
This looks like Ben drowned Lime.

104
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,120
Oh.

105
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,440
I got sunburned.

106
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,960
Yeah, you got a nice little tan there.

107
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,660
Yeah, sunburned.

108
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,480
I think I burnt the eyes off too.

109
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,560
But then also Matara had then no eyes.

110
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,540
We were just all over the place.

111
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,760
But then the last is my favorite.

112
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,640
This one's my favorite.

113
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,180
Yeah, it's Doki's.

114
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,280
With the goatee.

115
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,500
Goatee.

116
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,900
With the goatee.

117
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,680
Lime said that it looks like the lady from Mulan.

118
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,560
The matchmaker lady.

119
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,140
The matchmaker.

120
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,280
Don't worry, I'll find a girl for you guys.

121
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,000
Don't worry.

122
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,240
So yeah, now that's why we're all as we are now.

123
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,600
Yeah, that's why we brought our alternate selves.

124
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,740
Yeah.

125
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,840
We have too many layers.

126
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,680
Too many clothes on.

127
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,200
We gotta take our clothes off.

128
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,520
That's why we're naked now.

129
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,620
Wait.

130
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,260
I'm wearing clothes.

131
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,340
I'm wearing clothes now.

132
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,620
You were.

133
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,320
I'm not wearing clothes.

134
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,120
Lime and I are...

135
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,980
You are definitely not wearing clothes, Lime.

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,580
Look, you're like flaunting it out.

137
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,480
Lime, extend.

138
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,720
Pause.

139
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,340
I'm not wearing clothes and I'm like spreading.

140
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:50,920
You're like...

141
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,780
You're manspreading.

142
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,940
Show yourself.

143
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,660
You're like literally manspreading right now, Lime.

144
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,900
Look at those legs.

145
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,600
Oh my god.

146
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,720
We're all very cute.

147
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,780
We're on live television too.

148
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,740
On live television.

149
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,320
We're gonna have to give censor back.

150
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,220
Oh my god.

151
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,100
This is gonna be the last episode of Wheel of Fortune.

152
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:17,800
Ever.

153
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,720
Are we all showing our feetsies?

154
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,240
Are we?

155
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,620
Maybe.

156
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,200
I see mint feetsies.

157
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,140
Yeah, okay.

158
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,960
Go ahead and show yours, Mataro.

159
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,820
Okay, Kroky, you're next.

160
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,120
No, Kroky, you're next.

161
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,460
Wait, show what?

162
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,180
Feet.

163
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:32,660
Your feet.

164
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,700
My feet?

165
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,120
Oh, wait.

166
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,880
I have to...

167
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,120
Wait, I have to show...

168
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,540
Hold on.

169
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,260
I can move you.

170
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

171
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,560
Show it.

172
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,280
Whoa.

173
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,500
That's right, boy.

174
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,560
We're on this channel only.

175
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,460
Whoa.

176
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:48,820
Wow.

177
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,640
All right, Mataro.

178
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,040
Your turn.

179
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,020
All right.

180
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,340
These are my feetsies.

181
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,480
Whoa.

182
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,800
How do you stand up?

183
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,460
You only have two toes.

184
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,040
I have two toesies.

185
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,440
I'm a man.

186
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,140
I'm an alien, girl.

187
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,100
Don't make fun of me.

188
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,220
What?

189
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,540
I think Doki's trying to eat your feet.

190
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,980
She's nibbling on you.

191
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,520
This has turned into an episode of Jerry Springer.

192
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,360
This is not that kind of television.

193
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,480
I'm not that kind of orc.

194
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,500
Well, guys, welcome to Wheel of Fortune.

195
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,600
Let's start our first game.

196
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,200
Oh, let me explain for those who don't know how to play.

197
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,440
Anyone at home as well.

198
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,100
So, essentially, there will be given a category.

199
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,640
The category could be phrase.

200
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,760
It could be food.

201
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,540
It could be the... your mom.

202
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,220
My mom?

203
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,760
Don't put my mom as a category.

204
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,640
She was last night.

205
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,580
She gets to pass.

206
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,240
It's her birth...

207
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,080
Okay, it's not her birthday, but it's her stream birthday.

208
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,760
It is my birthday.

209
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,180
It's...

210
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,920
So careful.

211
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,420
I was...

212
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,120
I'm not going to be around your mom at Thanksgiving.

213
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,680
I'm not in any time zone right now.

214
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,140
Oh, you're right.

215
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,140
Now we're past it.

216
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,900
Yes, past your birthday.

217
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,840
But yeah, so you'll be given...

218
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,220
Don't have to birth these hoopa.

219
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,420
Sabotaging my stream?

220
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,540
So yeah, you'll be given a phrase, or a word, or whatever.

221
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,000
And you spin your wheel.

222
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,020
And you land on a certain money amount, monetary amount.

223
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,600
And you guess a letter.

224
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:37,840
However many of that letter is in the word or phrase, you'll get that much money.

225
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,280
And you'll have to be able to get money to buy vowels.

226
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,980
And then once you know, you can solve it!

227
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,880
And after that, when you solve it, I'm gonna have to watch the tutorial because I don't know.

228
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,280
I don't know where to go from there.

229
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,000
Also...

230
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,360
Oh shit, wait, that's a real game?

231
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,660
Do we win real money?

232
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,820
I thought you made this in Photoshop.

233
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,560
I didn't realize this was the game.

234
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,240
Yeah, this is a real game!

235
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:11,580
Yeah!

236
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,160
I thought you made it in Photoshop.

237
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:15,900
No!

238
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:21,900
She was just gonna be dragging letters onto the board in Clip Studio Paint or some shit?

239
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,380
She's gonna drag letters to the wall and get a fucking Google wheel.

240
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,440
No!

241
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,720
I went fancy!

242
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,540
I went fancy!

243
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,100
Alright, let's start our first round then.

244
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,260
Let's get to it.

245
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,020
Okay.

246
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,300
How do I do this?

247
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,500
Oh, load a puzzle.

248
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,760
Okay, hold on.

249
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,820
You got this.

250
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,420
I got this.

251
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay, one.

252
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,080
You're doing amazing.

253
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,120
Dun-dun-dun!

254
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,580
This is... the category is a stream quote.

255
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,060
So a quote from a stream.

256
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,180
It's probably a popular quote.

257
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,680
Probably?

258
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,160
Ah.

259
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,980
Said by maybe a Vtuber somewhere.

260
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:00,520
Ah.

261
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,200
Mm-hmm.

262
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,400
So we're gonna start with Matawa.

263
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,460
We have your wheel.

264
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,800
I might need help.

265
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,920
So I have to spin the wheel?

266
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,680
Yes.

267
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,640
Okay.

268
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,520
Spin that wheel.

269
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,400
Yeah!

270
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,340
Spin that wheel!

271
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,160
Spin, spin, spin, spin.

272
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,660
Oh, okay, goodbye.

273
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,980
That was really exciting.

274
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,520
Thanks, guys.

275
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,660
I guess so.

276
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,720
I had my letter and stuff.

277
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,000
Spin that wheel.

278
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,720
I had my letter.

279
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,240
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,260
Okay.

281
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:34,660
My turn.

282
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,960
Time for Croaky to...

283
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,680
Yay!

284
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,180
Spin that wheel!

285
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,700
I swear to...

286
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,000
Whoa!

287
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,540
2,500.

288
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,480
2,500.

289
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,000
Holy cow.

290
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,540
Oh, my God.

291
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,560
I'm fucking rich.

292
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,840
Wait, isn't that the second most expensive you can get?

293
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:52,980
I don't know.

294
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,160
So what's your letter?

295
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,240
A.

296
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,640
A.

297
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,940
You have to buy the...

298
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,400
I would like to buy a letter.

299
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,520
You have no money.

300
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,980
Wait, did I not get 2,500?

301
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,800
No, you only get that amount.

302
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,060
If you get the letter.

303
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,580
You have to get the letter, guys.

304
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,740
I'm the only one who has no fucking clue what they're doing.

305
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,460
Can I have an IOU?

306
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,480
I know.

307
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,260
In honor of Croaky, I choose C.

308
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,200
All right.

309
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,640
For Croaky, I choose C.

310
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,200
C!

311
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,820
You copycat.

312
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,720
I was going to do M for Matawa.

313
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,180
Oh.

314
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:33,680
No C?

315
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,100
No C.

316
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,000
No!

317
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,460
So sorry for you.

318
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,640
Well, I'm...

319
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,540
Do I still get money?

320
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,180
Hello.

321
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,360
Oh.

322
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,420
You ready to spin the wheel?

323
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,240
I am ready to spin the wheel.

324
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,720
Next time.

325
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,800
Stop eating me!

326
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,020
What?

327
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,420
What do you think?

328
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:56,620
What?

329
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:56,940
I'm on the ground.

330
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,940
What the fuck?

331
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,540
What are these?

332
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,340
At least it's good that you roll it now.

333
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:02,860
Yeah.

334
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,280
Yeah.

335
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,660
You get it now instead of...

336
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,060
There's no way you're going to get it again.

337
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,320
What are these spins?

338
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,600
What do you mean?

339
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,500
I got a good spin.

340
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,420
It just wasn't C.

341
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,480
You're just stupid.

342
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:10,880
All right.

343
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,800
Spin my wheel.

344
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,400
All right.

345
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:13,900
Matawa.

346
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,980
I can go with this.

347
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,660
Spin my wheel.

348
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,680
Marinate me.

349
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:16,960
There you go.

350
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,240
Oh.

351
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,620
Give me some good.

352
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,220
Give me some good.

353
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:19,800
$700.

354
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:20,820
All right.

355
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,220
I choose M for Matawa.

356
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:24,680
Wow.

357
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:24,980
M.

358
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,060
Let's see.

359
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,360
Is there any M's on the board?

360
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,160
No.

361
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,900
No M's.

362
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,800
No M's.

363
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,560
I got so many M's.

364
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,480
Oh, I got one.

365
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,040
I know.

366
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,940
I bet my next letter is going to work.

367
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,400
Okay.

368
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:36,780
Let's see.

369
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,520
You're going to get bankrupt.

370
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,440
If you even have a turn.

371
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,540
There's no way.

372
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,000
$600?

373
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,480
Yeah.

374
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:42,800
Okay.

375
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,300
$600.

376
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,280
I choose L.

377
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,280
L.

378
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,920
Is there an L on the board?

379
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,580
No.

380
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,540
What?

381
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,180
How?

382
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,500
What is this?

383
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,600
I don't think this place has any letters.

384
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,480
What did you put in there?

385
00:16:59,480 --> 00:16:59,840
What did you put in there?

386
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,560
There's no L.

387
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,300
It could be anything.

388
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,760
Can we get some L's in chat?

389
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,040
There's already plenty of L's in there.

390
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,400
I mean, we're all technically L-ing right now.

391
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,760
Well, it's a good thing Lime didn't go L for Limes.

392
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,120
Yeah.

393
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,400
I don't want to do L letters.

394
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:15,760
No.

395
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,540
Okay.

396
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:16,900
No.

397
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,700
I had a turn.

398
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,720
I had two turns.

399
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,320
All right.

400
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,580
It's a good thing I have my glasses.

401
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,080
That's great.

402
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,020
All right.

403
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,840
Ready, Lime?

404
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,220
I'm going to keep my eyes.

405
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,660
I'm going to keep my eyes.

406
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,640
He's eating my eyes.

407
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,580
That's right.

408
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,420
You're a bug.

409
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:29,980
Wow.

410
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,720
Number?

411
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,540
500.

412
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,960
I pick T.

413
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,760
T.

414
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,380
Is there a T on the board?

415
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,820
Two T's!

416
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,200
And there wasn't an M?

417
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,160
Sorry.

418
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:46,840
Or an L?

419
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,120
Or a C?

420
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,940
I think you get to go again, Lime.

421
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,280
Oh, really?

422
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:52,900
Yeah.

423
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,640
How much does a L cost?

424
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,280
How much does a vowel cost?

425
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,600
250, I think.

426
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,380
Oh.

427
00:17:59,500 --> 00:17:59,780
Wait.

428
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,200
250.

429
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,200
Like, not 2,500.

430
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:02,760
Just 250.

431
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,380
250.

432
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,700
Okay.

433
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,000
Cool.

434
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,360
Cool.

435
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:06,620
Cool.

436
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:06,760
Cool.

437
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:06,900
Cool.

438
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,240
Yeah.

439
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:07,740
Pick O.

440
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,180
Do we spin again?

441
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,440
Or do I just pick another one?

442
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,040
Um.

443
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,500
Uh.

444
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,600
She surely knows.

445
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,880
Min, you're the host.

446
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,820
She surely knows.

447
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,800
Min, you're the host.

448
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,260
Oh, spin again.

449
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:20,860
Okay.

450
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,120
Yeah.

451
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,820
You spin again.

452
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,620
Okay.

453
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,420
Spin.

454
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,280
Is that real?

455
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,580
Spin for Lime.

456
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,640
800.

457
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,520
800?

458
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,640
Wow.

459
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,340
Okay.

460
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,020
Okay.

461
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,320
I pick H.

462
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,200
H.

463
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,360
Is there an H on the board?

464
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,840
You're so smart.

465
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,020
Two.

466
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,480
Wow.

467
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:53,200
That kind of makes things a little more clear, I'd say.

468
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,000
Okay.

469
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:54,620
Okay.

470
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,960
Oh, and your money.

471
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,100
Thank you for my money.

472
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,840
You're welcome.

473
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,140
Um.

474
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,720
Do you spin again?

475
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,010
Yes.

476
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,770
Oh, do you want to do a vowel?

477
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,150
I think it's either spin or vowel.

478
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,530
We're trying to distract her.

479
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,930
I would like a vowel.

480
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:16,310
Okay.

481
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,670
I will pick E, please.

482
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,150
E.

483
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,310
How do I distract the money?

484
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:20,990
Yes.

485
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,270
E.

486
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,590
Oh, she did it.

487
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,090
Ta-da!

488
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,810
You only pay once?

489
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,690
This is her one turn.

490
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,150
Wow.

491
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:29,910
Wow.

492
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,750
I'm doing stuff.

493
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,190
Yeah.

494
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,590
Something, something, be something, something.

495
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,610
You can read?

496
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,030
Oh, my God.

497
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:37,610
Yeah, I can.

498
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,950
Something, something.

499
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,170
Don't look at chat, just in case they get it, too.

500
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

501
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,010
Ah.

502
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,910
Do I spin again?

503
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,130
I spin again.

504
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,490
Yeah, you're killing it.

505
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,030
You're on a roll.

506
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,490
Wait.

507
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,330
Does you get that money?

508
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,710
I think you get the money, too.

509
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,890
You get the money.

510
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,030
You get the money.

511
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,550
Guys, I don't think Matara and I are ever going to have a turn anymore.

512
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:00,890
No.

513
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,810
Trophy, you remember her in Lockdown Protocol.

514
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,530
She's a gamer.

515
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,130
This is it.

516
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:05,550
We're done.

517
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,110
This is not fair.

518
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,670
Are you ready?

519
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,990
You're smarter than the average YouTuber.

520
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,150
This is not fair.

521
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,370
Did you know she had a real job?

522
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,310
Oh, my God.

523
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:15,770
It went up.

524
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,490
$850.

525
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,070
Oh, my God.

526
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,110
It went up.

527
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,550
Okay.

528
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,250
Let me think about it for a second.

529
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:20,470
Okay.

530
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,190
I hope I spelled these right.

531
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:22,210
No.

532
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:22,590
Stop thinking.

533
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,530
It's not fair to the non-thinkers.

534
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,570
Go with your guts.

535
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,330
Stop thinking.

536
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,130
You already have $3,150.

537
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:32,650
Don't think.

538
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,450
Just do.

539
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:34,770
Don't think.

540
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,130
Just pick.

541
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:35,930
N.

542
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:36,830
N.

543
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,670
Is there an N on the board?

544
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:41,630
Yeah.

545
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:42,850
Oh.

546
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,330
Oh, my God.

547
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,630
Lime is rich, Rich.

548
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,970
Lime is going to get it.

549
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,770
I don't think we can catch up anymore.

550
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,090
I think we have to get it.

551
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,070
I think she just wins.

552
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,510
You don't get money for vowels.

553
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,170
Oh.

554
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,950
Oh, this is rigged!

555
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:57,230
Sorry.

556
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,950
Well, we're doing money for vowels in this version.

557
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,490
Okay, guys?

558
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,110
I think it's because they're both green.

559
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,330
That's what's going on, Croaky.

560
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,930
I can't believe it.

561
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,370
This is bootleg Wheel of Fortune.

562
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,230
This is not endorsed by Wheel of Fortune.

563
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,050
I can't believe it.

564
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:13,950
Wheel.

565
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,030
Here, let's spin.

566
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,730
I'd like to buy a vowel, though.

567
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,130
Just kidding.

568
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,110
We're going to buy a vowel.

569
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,530
Oh, please.

570
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:22,490
Oh!

571
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,150
Yeah.

572
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,910
Subtract.

573
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:26,950
No!

574
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:28,530
What?

575
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,030
Oh my god.

576
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,830
I'm so happy.

577
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,070
Wait, does this mean it's my turn?

578
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,370
It's your turn, Matawa.

579
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,930
Unless you go bankrupt.

580
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,290
Or lose a turn.

581
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,430
I don't have any money.

582
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,530
Or lose a turn.

583
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,050
It's okay.

584
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,550
You don't need to have a vowel.

585
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,210
You can buy it later.

586
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:49,970
Okay.

587
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,350
Okay.

588
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,550
Five hundred dollars.

589
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,650
What would you like to guess?

590
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,110
Okay.

591
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,030
I have to...

592
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,350
This is tough.

593
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:01,990
Yeah.

594
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,690
I need to get the letter right.

595
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,510
But I don't know what the letter is.

596
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,350
Guess anything.

597
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,470
It could be any letter.

598
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,470
Go with your heart.

599
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:12,950
Yeah.

600
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,710
I need a letter.

601
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,370
Stop thinking.

602
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:15,550
All right.

603
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:21,010
May I please have an S?

604
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,070
S.

605
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,270
Like serpentine.

606
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,270
S.

607
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,250
Is there any S's on the board?

608
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,290
Is it?

609
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,290
No.

610
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,310
Oh, no.

611
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:35,310
This is the line we'll sweep right here.

612
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,350
Kroki, you still have a chance.

613
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,670
Back to you, Kroki.

614
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,470
You have a chance.

615
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:40,610
Wait.

616
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,150
I mean Kroki.

617
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:41,770
Who's Doki?

618
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,190
Yeah.

619
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,650
Who's Doki?

620
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:43,750
Kroki.

621
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,330
$500 for you, Kroki.

622
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,350
Oh, no.

623
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,250
And I think you can solve it anytime.

624
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,790
Yeah, but like what the fuck is that?

625
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,530
Something, something, V, something, something.

626
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:07,390
Think of famous like Vtuber quotes set on stream.

627
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:07,670
What?

628
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,230
You think I remember that?

629
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,810
I just remember my own quotes.

630
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,510
I swear.

631
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,950
She's a bear.

632
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,990
She's a bird.

633
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,110
She's a bird brain, you guys.

634
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:14,630
Yeah.

635
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,070
Um.

636
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:19,710
Um.

637
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,210
R.

638
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:22,970
R.

639
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:26,710
Two.

640
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,150
I would like to buy a power.

641
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,050
What would you like to buy?

642
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,030
That's a good question.

643
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:38,690
Okay.

644
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,170
There's only three.

645
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:40,850
Oh.

646
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,190
You guys.

647
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:41,490
Oh.

648
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:41,990
A.

649
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:42,770
A.

650
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:45,290
One.

651
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,510
Oh, my God.

652
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,230
Oh, okay.

653
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,130
Uh.

654
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,510
Yup.

655
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,670
Um.

656
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:56,690
Go.

657
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:57,770
Come on, Kroki.

658
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,070
Oh.

659
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,510
Wait, wait, wait.

660
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,290
Spin the wheel.

661
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,490
Oh, spin the wheel.

662
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,590
Wait, wait.

663
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,930
I think I have a letter for this.

664
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:03,410
Okay.

665
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:03,890
Okay.

666
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,310
Okay.

667
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,510
I think I have a letter.

668
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,350
Okay.

669
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:07,310
Okay.

670
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:07,810
Oh, 900.

671
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:08,370
Okay.

672
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,090
Okay.

673
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:11,430
Double.

674
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:11,770
W.

675
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,110
W?

676
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:12,930
Ooh.

677
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:13,830
Yeah.

678
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,090
Because I was like, that has to be Y.

679
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,250
Ah.

680
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:17,590
Ah.

681
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,930
Ah.

682
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,110
Ah.

683
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,550
What the fuck is the third word?

684
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,990
I think, I think you can pretty much solve it, Kroki, if you just guess it genuinely.

685
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,810
Wait.

686
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:29,090
Oh.

687
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:29,890
Oh, wait.

688
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,390
Buy.

689
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,070
Buy.

690
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,470
Wait.

691
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,450
Can I buy a vowel?

692
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,430
Can I solve it after?

693
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,490
Why don't you just solve it now?

694
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,730
I don't know what the fuck is the third word.

695
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:38,950
Okay.

696
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,110
Okay.

697
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,090
Buy a vowel.

698
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:42,690
Wait, wait.

699
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,170
Buy can solve it after, right?

700
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,210
I think so.

701
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:45,770
Yeah.

702
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:46,410
I think so.

703
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:46,750
Yeah.

704
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,550
Okay.

705
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,050
Okay.

706
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,110
Um, I would like to buy I.

707
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,150
I.

708
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:54,930
Bing.

709
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:55,830
Oh.

710
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:56,730
Yeah.

711
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,130
Ooh.

712
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:00,970
Okay.

713
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:01,610
You got this, Kroki.

714
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,930
So, this is water in the blank.

715
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,710
Okay.

716
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,530
Oh, that's fire.

717
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:06,370
Yeah.

718
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,950
Put the water in the fire.

719
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,970
What's, what the fuck is...

720
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,450
I don't know.

721
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:16,250
It's either why or who, but there's no more O.

722
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:17,330
Oh.

723
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,510
Stop helping her.

724
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,110
What kind of conversation is this?

725
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,550
Oh, sorry.

726
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,390
I mean, she was gonna win anyway.

727
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,590
I helped a little too.

728
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,190
What's the answer?

729
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,550
Water in the fire.

730
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,270
Why?

731
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,050
Why?

732
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,550
I don't remember which one we don't have.

733
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:39,490
Yay.

734
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,330
I don't know.

735
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:41,430
I don't know.

736
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,510
I don't know how much money you get.

737
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:43,610
Um.

738
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,710
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

739
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,130
Hold on.

740
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,370
Let me watch the tutorial.

741
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,070
That's a quote?

742
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,970
Wait, whose quote is that?

743
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,110
That's from Korone.

744
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:51,930
I like how...

745
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,690
You still have less money than I.

746
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:54,750
I know.

747
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:55,710
You really do.

748
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:55,890
Yeah.

749
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,710
But I have less money than both of you.

750
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:58,690
Yay.

751
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,570
Hold on.

752
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,470
Let me watch the tutorial real quick and see what happens at the end of the game.

753
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,890
You're watching the tutorial.

754
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:07,930
Okay.

755
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,030
And transfer Jo's round score to Jo's total.

756
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:11,410
Oh, okay.

757
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:11,970
I have the total.

758
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,670
Okay.

759
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:13,630
Clear the board.

760
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:14,750
Ding, ding, ding.

761
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,230
Oh!

762
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:15,590
Wait!

763
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,170
What happened to the total money?

764
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,150
You stole my money!

765
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:19,610
What?

766
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:19,750
Wait.

767
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,670
What happened to it?

768
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,160
The plot twist.

769
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,320
Just like...

770
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:25,840
You stole her money.

771
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,420
Wait.

772
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,080
Wait.

773
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,900
This is live television.

774
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,700
Where'd the money go?

775
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,760
This is reality TV.

776
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,160
Why?

777
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,480
She's just trying not to give you your payout.

778
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,100
Oh.

779
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,980
Only the winner gets the payout?

780
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,500
Only the winner keeps their money.

781
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,320
This is some bullshit.

782
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:40,920
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

783
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,220
I see.

784
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:43,660
Wait.

785
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,000
That's mean.

786
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,480
American game Jo's.

787
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:48,620
Wait.

788
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:51,700
Huh?

789
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,940
I got the money.

790
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,500
Wait.

791
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,700
So I don't lose that money, right?

792
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,680
It's in the totals.

793
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,020
Well, only the winner gets paid.

794
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,420
Oh, okay.

795
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:58,760
So, yeah.

796
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,020
Yeah.

797
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,080
Only the winner gets paid.

798
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:00,980
Okay.

799
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,600
Oh, my God.

800
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,380
Sorry, Lon.

801
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:02,700
Wait.

802
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,260
I just realized none of us playing are American.

803
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,600
Yeah.

804
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:06,880
I know.

805
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,480
Oh, yeah.

806
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:07,880
It's true.

807
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,320
I know.

808
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,440
I don't even know how to play this game.

809
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:10,860
I...

810
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:11,700
Okay.

811
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,040
Okay.

812
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,060
Okay.

813
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,940
Well, I think we'll start with Lime next because we ended with Grokey.

814
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,260
So, next round.

815
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,400
Yeah.

816
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:19,960
Let's go to a...

817
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,260
Go, go.

818
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,220
Power Lime.

819
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,360
Wait.

820
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,440
How do I go to the next round?

821
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,340
Oh, here we go.

822
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,280
You're doing a great job hosting.

823
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:31,820
Yeah.

824
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,680
You're doing great.

825
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,380
Thanks.

826
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,080
It's a little rigged, but you're doing great.

827
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,200
How is it rigged?

828
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,100
I literally won.

829
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,200
I speak for the people.

830
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,040
We won.

831
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,360
We won.

832
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:43,680
I appreciate it.

833
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:43,740
Wait.

834
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,540
Grokey, open your mouth.

835
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,740
She speaks for the people.

836
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,780
All right.

837
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,720
This round is a game title.

838
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,080
All right, guys.

839
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,160
That's slightly more in my ballpark.

840
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,540
Let's go.

841
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,260
Yeah.

842
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,020
Yeah.

843
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,180
I made all these prompts, by the way, guys.

844
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:09,880
So...

845
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,580
Yeah.

846
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,140
But it's not Metal Gear Solid.

847
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,500
I can tell.

848
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,240
That would be the shortest Metal Gear Solid I've ever seen.

849
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,000
Well Lime, are you ready to spin your wheel?

850
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,520
Yes, I am.

851
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,300
What's the question mark?

852
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,660
Five hundred dollars.

853
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,260
I pick tea.

854
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:32,940
Tea!

855
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,000
Is there a tea on the board?

856
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,280
He's so brilliant.

857
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,400
No tea.

858
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,040
No tea!

859
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,980
No tea, so it's not the...

860
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,180
No, it's not the something.

861
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,820
Oh my god, I'm up next.

862
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,060
Alright, Metawa.

863
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,520
Spin.

864
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,300
Spin that wheel.

865
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,560
No!

866
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,820
No, you landed on a mystery.

867
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:57,940
Wait, what does that do?

868
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,880
I like it on the mystery.

869
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,320
You gotta get that letter.

870
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,600
Don't fail.

871
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,380
Maybe it's H.

872
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,020
No, it's M for me.

873
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,880
M for Metawa, please.

874
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,800
M for Metawa?

875
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,000
Is it M for Metawa?

876
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,480
Yeah!

877
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,320
Yay!

878
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,380
One M!

879
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,860
Oh my god, it actually worked.

880
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,000
One small M for Metawa.

881
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,940
One giant leap for my bank account.

882
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,820
Can I please buy the vowel?

883
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,800
Eh.

884
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:34,940
What?

885
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,880
She wants to buy a vowel.

886
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:37,760
What is it?

887
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,420
Eh?

888
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,220
Eh?

889
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,980
It's after A.

890
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,900
And before E.

891
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,080
Wait.

892
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,140
A, E?

893
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:45,500
Wait.

894
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,660
Yeah, it's E.

895
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,220
It's E.

896
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,280
It's E.

897
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,020
No, no, no.

898
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,700
It's E, E, E.

899
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,500
E, E.

900
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:51,880
Oh, okay, okay.

901
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,600
I'm sorry.

902
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,500
I was being dumb.

903
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,100
My coffee's getting weird.

904
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:02,240
I think, okay, I'm gonna not do the, the, the, you get the vowel money though because that's apparently not how you play.

905
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,800
Oh, oh, oh.

906
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,400
Now that you gotta give me money, you don't wanna entice me.

907
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,440
Yeah.

908
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,360
It would be $10,000.

909
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,200
Yeah.

910
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,540
It's $10,000.

911
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:12,780
So E?

912
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:13,700
Yeah.

913
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,040
E?

914
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,340
E.

915
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:15,780
E.

916
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:15,900
E.

917
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,220
Okay.

918
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,880
Is there a E on the board?

919
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,820
Give me an E.

920
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,040
There it is.

921
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,460
There is, there is.

922
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,800
What the fuck is this game?

923
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,480
Is it a game that you recently played?

924
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,700
I'm gonna look at your channel right now.

925
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,440
No, I haven't recently played.

926
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,360
No, don't look down.

927
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,160
Look down.

928
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,320
I'm gonna look at your bottom.

929
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,340
Oh.

930
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,120
I'm gonna look at your bottom.

931
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,440
So, I think you spin the wheel again, I think, or unless you want to buy another vowel.

932
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,140
I spin wheel.

933
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,320
Spin wheel.

934
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,920
Spin the wheel.

935
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,780
Spin the wheel.

936
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:51,820
$550.

937
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,840
May I get a...

938
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:00,940
N.

939
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,160
An N.

940
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,500
Is there an N on the board?

941
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,900
Is there an N?

942
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,440
No N.

943
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,800
I thought I... I thought I had it.

944
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,040
You almost had it.

945
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:14,900
You really did.

946
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,720
I thought I had it because it's Halloween and I thought you did that.

947
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,960
What was it?

948
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,480
What was the game you were thinking of?

949
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,180
I thought it was Ink Machine.

950
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,040
But it would have been Bendy and the Ink Machine, right?

951
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,100
Oh, yeah, yeah.

952
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,720
No, no.

953
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,540
That's way more wholesome than how I was thinking.

954
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,420
Alright, Croaky, we spin the wheel for you.

955
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,080
Spin that wheel.

956
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,080
Spin that wheel.

957
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,560
Spin the wheel.

958
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,720
$500.

959
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,140
I have no idea what the fuck this game is.

960
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,740
What is it?

961
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,380
Give me...

962
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,840
Give me an...

963
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,260
Oh, my God.

964
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,100
Give me a...

965
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,000
L.

966
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,640
L.

967
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,760
Is there an L on the board?

968
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,680
She's stealing your letter line.

969
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,760
Well, it's a good thing.

970
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,720
She's stealing your letter line.

971
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:09,980
Thank you.

972
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:10,960
Thank God.

973
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,880
Croaky taking another L.

974
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,540
One day the L will work.

975
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,600
One day.

976
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,740
One day.

977
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,020
Lime, are you ready?

978
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:22,980
Yes.

979
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,960
Lime, we gotta work together so Matari doesn't get $10,000.

980
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,800
Wait, but you did work.

981
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,580
We did work together for you not to get money like this.

982
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,660
$650.

983
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,560
Oh, you almost got the mystery.

984
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,100
Yeah.

985
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,200
S, please.

986
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,840
S.

987
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,480
S on the board.

988
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,320
The consensus is...

989
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,680
Oh, yes.

990
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,080
Sorry.

991
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,800
What is it?

992
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,300
Oh, my God.

993
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:46,960
Wait, wait.

994
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,600
Can I guess?

995
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,380
Can I guess already?

996
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,200
Yes, you can.

997
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,360
Is it orc massage?

998
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,160
You are such...

999
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,300
Is that orc massage?

1000
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,220
A little freak.

1001
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,520
Oh, my God.

1002
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,480
Lime, have you played that game yet?

1003
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,900
No, but my chat won't shut the fuck up about it.

1004
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,300
They're like, stream your orc massage.

1005
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,380
You didn't play orc massage?

1006
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,180
It will be funny.

1007
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,660
Oh, goodbye Matara's $10,000.

1008
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,080
Oh, goodbye.

1009
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,620
Nice job, Lime.

1010
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,100
Nice job.

1011
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,740
We worked together.

1012
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,300
Good job, Lime.

1013
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,620
We worked together.

1014
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,460
You put the L so she didn't pick it and then she got the winnings.

1015
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:27,740
Exactly.

1016
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,020
That's the only reason why I picked the L.

1017
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,900
Lime, I'm impressed you knew from social media.

1018
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,920
Wait, Mint, have you played orc massage, Mint?

1019
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,280
You know, actually, I haven't.

1020
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,060
Wait, you haven't?

1021
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,340
Wait, am I the only one that's played orc massage?

1022
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,640
When?

1023
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,080
Why?

1024
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:50,000
I mean, it was either massage or missive and I couldn't think of any games with the word missive in it, so...

1025
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,520
No, okay.

1026
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,960
So, like, I wanted to see what orc massage is all about because everybody kept talking about it.

1027
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,400
So, I bought it on an alt steam account, so...

1028
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:58,920
Oh, my God.

1029
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,840
But the thing was...

1030
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,260
Coward.

1031
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,040
Coward.

1032
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,820
No, no, no.

1033
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:08,520
People found out because, like, I had my Discord status on, so it said, Turkey is playing.

1034
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,420
Still got outed.

1035
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,480
Still got outed.

1036
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,640
How was it, you know, thinking, like, game-wise, game-wise?

1037
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:29,080
It's, it's, it's, it's, I got to, like, the bird girl and then I stopped.

1038
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,740
There's a bird girl?

1039
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,620
There's four, there's three...

1040
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:33,960
Oh, sorry, guys.

1041
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,120
Oh, there's three plus different girls and I got to, like, the bird girl and then it was, it was pretty...

1042
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,360
It gets intense, the massage part, of course.

1043
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,620
I'm talking about the massage part.

1044
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,800
The massage part.

1045
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,780
Wait, do you massage orcs?

1046
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,900
Are the orcs the one massaging?

1047
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:55,980
No, the orc is the massager and you get, like, employed by goblins to massage monster girls.

1048
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,000
Oh.

1049
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,640
Sounds like a book I've read before.

1050
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,540
Right, Mataji?

1051
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,020
No, no, no, no.

1052
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,260
Please, Mataji.

1053
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,160
Well, it's not a minotaur milking farm, Mataji, no.

1054
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,060
Only podcast listeners will know.

1055
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,280
No.

1056
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,780
I kind of wish I hadn't guessed now because, like, my chat will not leave me alone now.

1057
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,660
It's like, wow, Shaymin, how come you're so familiar with orc massaging?

1058
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,280
Limes, you have outed yourself as a little pervert.

1059
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,760
You have.

1060
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,200
Yeah.

1061
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,160
That's, okay.

1062
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,700
We're going to take...

1063
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,480
Gotta own it.

1064
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,280
A quick commercial break.

1065
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,580
Okay.

1066
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,820
And everybody don't leave.

1067
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:38,300
We're going to go to commercial break and we'll be back after these messages.

1068
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,580
Thank you, everybody.

1069
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,140
Bye.

1070
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,140
Bye.

1071
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,500
Bye.

1072
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,880
Bye.

1073
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,780
Bye.

1074
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,280
Bye.

1075
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:49,940
Bye.

1076
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,000
Bye.

1077
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,420
Bye.

1078
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,800
Bye.

1079
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,680
Bye.

1080
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:08,400
Bye.

1081
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,540
Everything is great at your goodness.

1082
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,540
Let's go to the next round.

1083
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,320
I think you guys should run more commercials on this channel.

1084
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,140
Are you guys getting monetized enough?

1085
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,340
I have more commercials.

1086
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,720
It's an ad break right now.

1087
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,820
Oh my god, I should.

1088
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,580
Yeah, you should have done like pre-roll ads.

1089
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,520
We had a commercial real quick and then ran a pre-roll.

1090
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:46,840
Alrighty.

1091
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,060
Lime, since you won last, we'll start with Matawa this time.

1092
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,140
Okay, I spin the wheel and I choose M.

1093
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,180
Oh, so fast.

1094
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,800
You might just lose a turn.

1095
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,100
I really wish you had.

1096
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,120
I forgot to say the category is advice.

1097
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,320
M.

1098
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,040
M.

1099
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,700
Is there an M on the board?

1100
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,320
Like platitudes?

1101
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,120
A single M.

1102
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:22,380
Is it advice from a stream or like your own personal advice?

1103
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,260
It's like if someone were to come up to you on the street and be like, hey, here's some advice.

1104
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:27,780
Okay.

1105
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,700
So like generic or sort of like well-known advice.

1106
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,040
Yeah.

1107
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,500
Okay.

1108
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,320
Yeah.

1109
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,000
So Matawa, what do you want to do?

1110
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,200
Spin again or buy a vowel?

1111
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,120
Spin.

1112
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:38,780
Spin.

1113
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,280
No.

1114
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,600
You buy a vowel.

1115
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,080
No, you buy a vowel.

1116
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,520
No, you buy a vowel.

1117
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,860
You should have bought a vowel.

1118
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:48,540
Lime.

1119
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,840
You should have done this.

1120
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,740
You should have bought a vowel.

1121
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,260
I'm really sorry to you.

1122
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,120
I'm really sorry to you.

1123
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,600
Well, I guess it's Croaky's turn.

1124
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:03,540
Yay.

1125
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,180
Spin that wheel.

1126
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,640
Your money.

1127
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:10,960
Yeah.

1128
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,260
Your money.

1129
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,060
Your money.

1130
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:13,560
L.

1131
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,400
L.

1132
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,100
Why did you still have to pick this one?

1133
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,320
It'll work eventually.

1134
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,080
Is there an L on the board?

1135
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,980
What?

1136
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:24,680
Yeah.

1137
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,900
A single L for you.

1138
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,940
Matawa, don't cry.

1139
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,800
This is literally showbiz, baby.

1140
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,220
Okay.

1141
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:33,300
Yeah.

1142
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,460
Yeah.

1143
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,160
Welcome to show business.

1144
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,920
Spin that wheel.

1145
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,180
I'm the one that got the L this turn.

1146
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,880
It's true.

1147
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,320
It's okay.

1148
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,560
You can always make a comeback.

1149
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,300
$500.

1150
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:44,880
Okay.

1151
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:45,260
$500?

1152
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,460
I don't know.

1153
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,800
Give me a...

1154
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,820
Give me a Y.

1155
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,280
Y.

1156
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,620
Is there a Y?

1157
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,300
Y.

1158
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,460
That's what Shakespeare once said.

1159
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,140
Do you want a Y?

1160
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,440
Is there a Y on the board?

1161
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,200
No.

1162
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:03,280
No.

1163
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,260
There is.

1164
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:04,900
Yeah.

1165
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,300
All right.

1166
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:07,400
Okay.

1167
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Spin that wheel.

1168
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,980
Oh, you don't want to buy a vowel?

1169
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,520
You selfish?

1170
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,340
I want Lime to buy it.

1171
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,880
I want Lime to buy a vowel.

1172
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,480
How am I supposed to buy a vowel?

1173
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,420
You are so selfish.

1174
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:16,980
I don't have money.

1175
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,740
You were telling me, Matawa, buy a vowel.

1176
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,220
But you keep only getting $500.

1177
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,640
So just keep going.

1178
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,180
All right.

1179
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:25,420
Okay.

1180
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:27,720
S.

1181
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:28,960
S.

1182
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,500
Yeah.

1183
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,160
Oh my gosh.

1184
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,260
Oh my gosh.

1185
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,900
Got it.

1186
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,520
Literally.

1187
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,640
One by one.

1188
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,680
Just taken it down.

1189
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,040
All right.

1190
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,100
What do you want to do now?

1191
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,360
Oh, okay.

1192
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,960
Now, this is being a little difficult.

1193
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:44,360
Bowel, vowel, vowel.

1194
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,320
Vowel, vowel, vowel, vowel.

1195
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,500
Bowel, vowel, vowel, vowel, vowel.

1196
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,920
What is the cheapest vowel?

1197
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,460
They are all cost the same.

1198
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,020
There is no vowel hierarchy.

1199
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,140
They are all...

1200
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,760
I don't care.

1201
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,920
They should be.

1202
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,300
The game is worth the money.

1203
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:00,340
Phohus and you.

1204
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,460
All right.

1205
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:02,720
Okay.

1206
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,180
Good job.

1207
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,580
You should be the lowest tier in the Vow hierarchy.

1208
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,180
Yes, it is.

1209
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,460
You rarely see words with you in it.

1210
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,200
I think...

1211
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,200
The word you.

1212
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,480
Okay, if I buy a Vow and I pick you, is it going to get anything?

1213
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,260
I don't know.

1214
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,300
I can't spoil for you.

1215
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,920
It's just going to prove a point if I choose you.

1216
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,820
I choose you, Pikachu.

1217
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,880
No, I didn't.

1218
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,880
I didn't choose it.

1219
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,520
Oh, I think she said, I choose you.

1220
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,500
Is there a you on the board?

1221
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:33,940
No!

1222
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,320
Loki, you were proven wrong.

1223
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:36,680
Yeah, I knew it.

1224
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,300
Yeah, you were proven wrong.

1225
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,660
I knew it.

1226
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,840
What the fuck is S...

1227
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,660
Like, S you what?

1228
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,680
Okay.

1229
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,600
Oh!

1230
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,420
Okay, we're going to spin, I think.

1231
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,300
Wait, I know like... I know like half this word... I know half this sentence.

1232
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,200
Do you?

1233
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,760
I think so.

1234
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:54,720
Say it.

1235
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:54,900
Say it.

1236
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,620
Yeah, the salt.

1237
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,660
Lime wants to hear it.

1238
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,840
Okay, wait, wait, spin the wheel.

1239
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,640
Just spin that wheel.

1240
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,080
Spin that wheel!

1241
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,240
Wait, can you hop salt by guessing?

1242
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:03,700
By guessing words?

1243
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,140
I don't think so.

1244
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:05,460
No.

1245
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,300
You have to guess the whole thing.

1246
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:06,760
No, I was going to say.

1247
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,100
Yeah.

1248
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,220
Okay.

1249
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,580
You would just buy the letters for it.

1250
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,380
Oh, wait, I should have just bought the... bought a vowel because I sort of know.

1251
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,240
You got a $900 spin!

1252
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,180
Okay.

1253
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,260
I don't know the top part.

1254
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,240
I don't know the top part.

1255
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,300
Well, just guess anything.

1256
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,500
Guess what you know.

1257
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,480
Oh, my God.

1258
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,200
Oh, no.

1259
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,220
Oh, my God.

1260
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,600
Oh, my God.

1261
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:41,900
Oh, why?

1262
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,020
Oh, my God.

1263
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,100
I don't know the top part.

1264
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,960
Oh, my God.

1265
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,240
Okay, let's go.

1266
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,420
Oh, my God.

1267
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,200
Oh, my God.

1268
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,220
Oh, my God.

1269
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,980
You are kidding.

1270
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,500
Oh, my God.

1271
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:54,960
I got it.

1272
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,980
Oh, my God.

1273
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,460
Oh, my God.

1274
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,700
Oh, my God.

1275
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,200
Okay guys, nice.

1276
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,340
Ahhhhhh...

1277
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,300
Alright, lime in your big brain.

1278
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,540
It's up to you.

1279
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,180
There's no pressure then.

1280
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:15,900
No pressure.

1281
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:16,220
No pressure.

1282
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,220
Oh, 900.

1283
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:20,740
Nice!

1284
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,460
Oh, 900.

1285
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,800
You should buy a vowel.

1286
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,000
I can't buy a vowel until I actually have the money.

1287
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,880
You should buy a vowel.

1288
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,160
You're like the devil on the shoulder, so the devil just gives really shitty advice.

1289
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,460
That's why you listen to me, because it's fun advice.

1290
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,440
It might be shitty, but it's fun.

1291
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,800
You should get that tramp stamp.

1292
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,520
I'm hoping that I'm right on the last word.

1293
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,520
An N!

1294
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,940
Is there an N on the board?

1295
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,480
That's what I was thinking, too.

1296
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:05,540
Oh my god, I thought it would be like, soon.

1297
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,960
This is targeted.

1298
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,380
Yeah, this is insane.

1299
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,460
This is targeted.

1300
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,460
You weren't allowed to get this weird.

1301
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,320
Lime, you gotta touch more grass, Lime.

1302
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,880
It's so poetic that Lime got this.

1303
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,260
I'll have everybody know, at Anime Expo, Lime kept wearing big sun hats.

1304
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:43,380
Because she didn't want to avoid the sun.

1305
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,520
It's healthy.

1306
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,400
It's healthy.

1307
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,860
It was targeted.

1308
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,660
I've gotten this advice, too.

1309
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,400
Damn, girl.

1310
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,460
You need sun.

1311
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,120
Awesome.

1312
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:03,000
Well, right now, we have Lime in the lead with $4,000.

1313
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,640
Croaky in second with $1,900.

1314
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,980
And Matawa doing her best.

1315
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,400
Let's go to the next puzzle.

1316
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,720
Let's go.

1317
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,180
Number five.

1318
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,300
I love being top three.

1319
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,040
This one is an event.

1320
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,700
An event?

1321
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,540
An event.

1322
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,640
An event.

1323
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:27,880
Alright.

1324
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,920
Well, Lime won, so we'll start with you, Matawa.

1325
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:31,860
Okay.

1326
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,140
To the shock of nobody, I will get money.

1327
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,140
You will get money.

1328
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,680
Matara, please.

1329
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:39,700
Matara.

1330
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,500
Matara, please.

1331
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,120
We need Matara.

1332
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:41,380
Please.

1333
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,780
You gotta pick something real calm.

1334
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,920
I bet on you, Matara.

1335
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,040
You went from third place to second place.

1336
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:46,540
Don't bet on me.

1337
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,280
I'm bad.

1338
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,900
I don't know.

1339
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:49,920
Okay.

1340
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,160
I pick...

1341
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,500
M for Matara.

1342
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,620
Are you sure?

1343
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,440
Okay.

1344
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,000
I don't think there's an M, Matara.

1345
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,400
Is there an M?

1346
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,960
She's here trying to give you an M.

1347
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,820
What if you flip the M upside down?

1348
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,220
Instead of Mumbo, it's Wumbo.

1349
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,580
Are we gonna ditch M for Matara, your old name?

1350
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,120
Alright.

1351
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,040
Is there an M?

1352
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:21,360
Nah, nah.

1353
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,140
I, I, I, I, uh...

1354
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:23,780
What is it?

1355
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,300
What is the word?

1356
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,100
I commit to Matara.

1357
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:25,960
She commits to the bet.

1358
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:26,700
Okay.

1359
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:27,560
Okay.

1360
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:28,880
No.

1361
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,520
Yippee.

1362
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,460
Spin that wheel.

1363
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,060
Alright.

1364
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,260
Spin that wheel.

1365
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,400
I'm backed up in my heart.

1366
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:39,760
Oh.

1367
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,180
Okay.

1368
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,180
I would like to pick W.

1369
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,300
W.

1370
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,520
W.

1371
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,280
W.

1372
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,000
W.

1373
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:49,740
W.

1374
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,260
W.

1375
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:50,420
W.

1376
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,200
W.

1377
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,180
Oh my god.

1378
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:52,380
Oh my god.

1379
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:52,860
There's my M.

1380
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,980
Oh my god.

1381
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,280
Who could have guessed?

1382
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,680
Who could have guessed?

1383
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,500
Wait, wait, wait.

1384
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,800
You know what, doki, you should buy a B.

1385
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,760
You should buy a B and get the tramp stamp.

1386
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,380
I didn't learn how to spell real quick.

1387
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:11,060
What?

1388
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:11,960
What?

1389
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,720
Do a doki, buy the B.

1390
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,520
Buy the B.

1391
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:18,500
WrestleTuber.

1392
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,160
Ah!

1393
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:20,700
Yay!

1394
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:31,760
Why is everyone who gets their own thing so mad?

1395
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,280
Was that the play though?

1396
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,760
Because I don't think either of us were to get it.

1397
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,900
So you could have farmed more money.

1398
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,260
Yeah, you could have farmed more money.

1399
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,760
I could have, but I also had to count to see if it fit.

1400
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,080
I'm so excited.

1401
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,460
I'm counting to see if it actually fit.

1402
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,860
I guess I could have farmed mine for more money too.

1403
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,780
The game is telling me a minimum of a thousand dollars has to be transferred.

1404
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,000
There we go.

1405
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,900
Okay, give me a thousand.

1406
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,940
Okay, you actually got a thousand.

1407
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,900
It's not rigged, it's just showbiz, baby.

1408
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,700
I'm still in third!

1409
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:09,360
Yay!

1410
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,940
Alright, let's go to our next...

1411
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,380
Wait, hold on, let me see what the next one is.

1412
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,480
Ah, okay, okay.

1413
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:19,380
Our next puzzle...

1414
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,880
Uh, wait.

1415
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,740
It's a place!

1416
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,220
A place.

1417
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,480
Oh wait, before we do this puzzle...

1418
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:31,500
A real place?

1419
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,300
Sorry, I have another ad.

1420
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,540
Oh, yay, yay, yay!

1421
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,160
Sorry, I gotta go through the ads.

1422
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,400
Sorry everybody, we'll be back after this quick commercial break.

1423
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,540
You can think of what this could be after this quick commercial break.

1424
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,900
We'll be right back.

1425
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,640
Yes, your house is haunted.

1426
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,900
It's haunted by me!

1427
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:01,280
Don't be fooled, those are not boobs on my chest.

1428
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,620
That's my butt bleeding through the back.

1429
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,120
Because I'm a ghost.

1430
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,740
You can see it's right through me.

1431
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:15,290
Yes, I'm haunting this place.

1432
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:25,570
And I'll keep haunting it until a more powerful, a stronger, a cooler ghost comes and takes my heart.

1433
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,470
Which will never happen.

1434
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:33,190
What is that?

1435
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:34,670
This energy.

1436
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:36,050
This great energy.

1437
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:37,230
I feel...

1438
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:50,250
That great energy, whatever could it be?

1439
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:55,490
Why, it's the Mint Phantom Happy Coat.

1440
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:56,910
Of course.

1441
00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:05,450

00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,470
It's so powerful.

1444
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:15,110

Yes.

1451
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:50,490
I'm suddenly craving a coat.

1452
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:51,570
A coat?

1453
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:52,710
That's mysterious.

1454
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:53,890
I know.

1455
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:56,670
You feel very powerful wearing mine.

1456
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:57,230
And happy.

1457
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:57,950
And happy.

1458
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:01,530
Oh my god.

1459
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:02,090
No skip of the ads.

1460
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,170
No skip of the ads.

1461
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:07,470
You have ad blocker on, right guys?

1462
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:07,990
Yes.

1463
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:08,870
Yeah.

1464
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:09,550
Yeah.

1465
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:10,990
Yeah.

1466
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:11,390
Why?

1467
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:13,450
Okie dokie.

1468
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:15,570
He was number one.

1469
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:17,050
Croaky won last round.

1470
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:19,990
So we're going to start this one of the place with lime.

1471
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:21,750
Yay.

1472
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:22,910
Yay.

1473
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:23,310
Yay.

1474
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:24,630
Alright.

1475
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:26,430
So you said this was places.

1476
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:28,510
Is it real places or can it be pretend places?

1477
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:31,830
Pretend.

1478
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:32,890
Places.

1479
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:34,970
Oh, it's pretend places then it is.

1480
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:37,730
Not a real place.

1481
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:40,150
Well, it's a real place, though.

1482
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:41,110
Ok.

1483
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:41,750
But it's also.

1484
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:43,730
Is it in Metal Gear Solid?

1485
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:44,310
No.

1486
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:45,490
Maybe.

1487
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:46,630
I don't know.

1488
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:49,690
Actually, maybe.

1489
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:50,630
Who knows.

1490
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,170
It's Metal Gear Solid, guys.

1491
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:52,890
This is not Metal Gear Solid.

1492
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:53,430
We have 20 questions.

1493
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:54,590
This is Wheel of Fortune.

1494
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:58,070
$500 live.

1495
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:02,070
I pick...

1496
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:04,630
S.

1497
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:07,810
Is there...

1498
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:10,390
an S on the board?

1499
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:11,710
No, I put the L.

1500
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:13,630
No, S.

1501
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:15,930
That was so cute.

1502
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:17,370
That was cute.

1503
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:20,310
Alright, spin the wheel.

1504
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:21,170
Spin the wheel.

1505
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:24,490
I don't know why it's in my head.

1506
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:25,950
Yeah, wheel.

1507
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:27,190
Yeah, wheel.

1508
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:28,270
Yeah.

1509
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:30,230
Pick M.

1510
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:32,850
How did you know?

1511
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:34,930
How did you know I was going to pick M?

1512
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:37,230
I could read your mind.

1513
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,010
What am I thinking about now?

1514
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:41,530
M.

1515
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:44,310
Wait, I'm going to think about something else.

1516
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:45,650
What am I thinking about now?

1517
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:46,930
Matara.

1518
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:48,490
For Matara.

1519
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:50,690
Okay, wait, wait.

1520
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:53,210
I'm going to think about something completely different, okay?

1521
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:54,510
Try to figure it out.

1522
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:54,970
Okay, wait.

1523
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:56,390
3, 2, 1.

1524
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:57,030
M.

1525
00:51:58,190 --> 00:51:58,910
For Matara.

1526
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:01,090
Oh my god, she knows me.

1527
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,210
She knows me so well.

1528
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:02,830
I told you.

1529
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:04,450
Psycho Doki.

1530
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:08,510
Psycho Mantis.

1531
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:10,710
Psycho Doki.

1532
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:12,850
Ning.

1533
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,770
May I please have an M?

1534
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:17,850
Okay.

1535
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:19,430
Why are you laughing?

1536
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:21,890
There was no M.

1537
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:23,050
No.

1538
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:26,850
Alright, Krokin.

1539
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:28,290
Eventually Matara, I bet.

1540
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:30,590
Spin that wheel.

1541
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:31,490
Oh, gosh.

1542
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,410
Oh, that was close.

1543
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:32,850
Yeah.

1544
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:35,550
I had zero dollars, so.

1545
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:36,110
Yeah, that's true.

1546
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:37,290
Alright, what do you want?

1547
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:40,330
Alright, I will pick L.

1548
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:41,710
L.

1549
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:43,030
Yeah.

1550
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:44,730
Oh gosh, who said that?

1551
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:49,130
Apparently, I just have to take the opportunity to pick L whenever I can.

1552
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:50,030
Yeah, in other words, get sniped.

1553
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,250
That's your fault for not picking L.

1554
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,170
Yeah, I guess so.

1555
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:56,510
I am Doki's conscience.

1556
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:59,070
Would it have benefited you to pick L?

1557
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:00,490
No.

1558
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:01,370
No!

1559
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:06,010
I shouldn't have listened to that demon on my shoulder.

1560
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,010
I shouldn't have listened to that demon on my shoulder.

1561
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:09,650
This could be anyone's game, Matara.

1562
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:10,470
This could be anyone's game, Matara.

1563
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:11,370
Let's spin the wheel.

1564
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:12,510
Oh, sorry, live.

1565
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:16,410
She's winning.

1566
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:17,610
She doesn't deserve this turn.

1567
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:21,370
Um, could I please have T?

1568
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:22,070
T!

1569
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:25,910
I remember last time the T worked for you.

1570
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:26,210
It's T time!

1571
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:27,790
Just one.

1572
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:29,970
But she got a letter!

1573
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:31,410
One letter.

1574
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,210
I'm on the board, let's go!

1575
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:37,530
Do you want to spin or do you want to buy a vowel?

1576
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:38,450
I spin.

1577
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:39,210
Spin.

1578
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:43,590
Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin.

1579
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:44,050
Oh, no!

1580
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:46,030
Oh, yes!

1581
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:49,470
I'm going to take everything.

1582
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:50,330
I'm so sorry.

1583
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:51,030
Even the 4,000.

1584
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:55,170
Wait, does it not take her 4,000?

1585
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:57,430
No, it only takes her because she banked it.

1586
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:58,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1587
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,170
Stop trying to lose me more money, Matara.

1588
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:02,310
Whoa!

1589
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:05,370
Just because I'm not picking M over and over again.

1590
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:06,650
Wow!

1591
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:07,850
Yeah, all right.

1592
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,030
Do you like great ads to lose your money?

1593
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:13,590
Quickly, put it in a Super Chat and give it to Mint.

1594
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:16,830
This show is brought to you by sponsors like you.

1595
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:19,270
Matara, you're at $700.

1596
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:21,070
Okay.

1597
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:24,550
Doki, what am I thinking?

1598
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:27,050
What am I thinking, Doki?

1599
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:30,150
You're thinking T for Tara.

1600
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:31,370
We already have T.

1601
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:34,550
Doki, what are we thinking?

1602
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:36,110
R for Ra.

1603
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:38,090
Okay.

1604
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:39,870
I am thinking N.

1605
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:47,530
A single N!

1606
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:48,630
Good job!

1607
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:49,090
Good job!

1608
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:53,570
All right, you want to spin or do you want to buy a vowel?

1609
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:55,130
Spin, spin, spin.

1610
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,130
Spin, spin, spin!

1611
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:57,910
All right, Doki, what am I thinking?

1612
00:54:58,470 --> 00:54:59,690
You're thinking O.

1613
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:05,490
It better be worth $850.

1614
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:08,290
That's a vowel.

1615
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:09,790
Sorry, I forgot my vowels.

1616
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:10,470
I'm not going to buy.

1617
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:17,330
Okay, okay, okay.

1618
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:22,930
I want to buy an H for Matara.

1619
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:23,930
Wait, buy?

1620
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:25,310
Matara?

1621
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:26,530
No, not buy, sorry.

1622
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,610
I want to get an H for Matara.

1623
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:28,870
An H?

1624
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,290
Is there an H on the board?

1625
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:32,330
Bing!

1626
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:33,550
There it is!

1627
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:35,830
Oh my god.

1628
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:37,490
What is that face?

1629
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:38,790
Is this her comeback?

1630
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:40,550
I should have said for hag.

1631
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:42,530
Why did I say for Hatara?

1632
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,290
All right, do you want to spin or do you want to buy a vowel?

1633
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:46,690
You should buy a vowel.

1634
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:52,740
Okay, hold on.

1635
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,520
I have to think.

1636
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:53,940
It's hard.

1637
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,580
Bing, bong, bing, bong.

1638
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:57,880
Bing, bong, bong.

1639
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,920
Can I spin the wheel?

1640
00:55:59,160 --> 00:55:59,740
Yes, you can.

1641
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,640
Or you may.

1642
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,060
This is...

1643
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:04,700
I'm shy.

1644
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:05,760
This is hard.

1645
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:06,580
Oh, okay.

1646
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,180
I hate this game!

1647
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:14,760
I'm never going back to the spinning wheel!

1648
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,280
All right, spin that wheel!

1649
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,600
Spin that wheel!

1650
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:22,620
Okay.

1651
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,840
Well, I had zero dollars, so that's all right, I guess.

1652
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,420
All right, Lime!

1653
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,300
Lime, we're spinning the wheel for you.

1654
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,800
This is rigged for Lime.

1655
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,460
Give me more clues, but all right.

1656
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:36,500
That's right.

1657
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,600
All right, 700 dollars.

1658
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,060
Let me think.

1659
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,120
Don't think, just do.

1660
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:44,480
Don't think.

1661
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,080
R,

1662
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,100
please.

1663
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:53,980
R!

1664
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,320
That's the letter my conscience was telling me to pick.

1665
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,180
You should have picked it.

1666
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,660
You should have picked it.

1667
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:01,500
I told you!

1668
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,760
I told you!

1669
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,740
You should have listened to me!

1670
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:05,920
I never failed you!

1671
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,420
You should have picked it!

1672
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:09,420
I told you!

1673
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:13,600
I was going to pick that, too!

1674
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,860
A lot, a lot of R's.

1675
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,580
Might as well be pirate day.

1676
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:20,480
R!

1677
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,720
What would you like to do?

1678
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,780
Would you like a buy a vowel, Lime, or would you like to spit?

1679
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:24,460
Buy a vowel.

1680
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:25,560
That's not...

1681
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,100
Your name is not Lime!

1682
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,860
Buy a vowel and get a trap now.

1683
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,080
You have so much money already, Lime!

1684
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,960
What's the minus fifty dollars to you?

1685
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:42,040
Could I pick... actually, I want a wheel, please.

1686
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:42,540
A wheel!

1687
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,580
I would like to wheel, please.

1688
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,060
Five hundred dollars.

1689
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,120
Okay, I pick F.

1690
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,240
F!

1691
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,440
A single F?

1692
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,140
Okay.

1693
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,560
Oh, are you farming?

1694
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,040
Wait, I think I know.

1695
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,460
I think I know the first one.

1696
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:12,840
Oh, no.

1697
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,020
Well, of course you would know, Lime.

1698
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:20,040
What are you trying to say?

1699
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,680
Yeah, I mean, you have the stuff.

1700
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,600
You can keep guessing.

1701
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,240
Oh, do you want to spend?

1702
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,180
Do you want to buy a vowel?

1703
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,500
Well, I only have this model because I had to.

1704
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,260
I couldn't be a person today.

1705
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,840
You're the one that was like, I really want to be a crow.

1706
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:40,780
I gotta be a crow.

1707
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:46,040
One of us delayed the stream so that they could be a crow.

1708
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:53,520
It was fifteen minutes!

1709
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,220
You had to get T anyway.

1710
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,320
Okay, I wish...

1711
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,520
I wish...

1712
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,180
Like...

1713
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:07,500
I know what the first word is.

1714
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:08,320
I'm pretty sure.

1715
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,880
I know what the first word is.

1716
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,360
You could spin and guess the ladder.

1717
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,120
Take the risk.

1718
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,560
I spin.

1719
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,420
She spins.

1720
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,120
Wouldn't it be funny if it was bankrupt?

1721
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,360
It would be funny if it was bankrupt.

1722
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:24,360
Wouldn't it be so funny?

1723
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,860
Or lose a turn!

1724
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,100
Or lose a turn!

1725
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:28,260
Lose a turn!

1726
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,660
Lose a turn!

1727
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,620
Alright, Matara.

1728
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,100
Hold on, we gotta spin.

1729
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,780
Guys, I have no idea what it is.

1730
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:38,500
We spin for you?

1731
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,200
I'm so bad.

1732
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,400
May I please buy an eye?

1733
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,420
An eye!

1734
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,600
Wait, did you spin and then buy?

1735
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,740
Yes, she did do that.

1736
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,240
Are you sure?

1737
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,240
Well, I guess I already deducted the money, so...

1738
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:56,580
A single!

1739
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:02,000
Can I please buy a U?

1740
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,220
Oh, okay.

1741
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,400
I thought it was fairy.

1742
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,780
And not this word.

1743
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,600
I thought it was fairy.

1744
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,920
Like M-E-R-R-Y.

1745
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:21,280
That's why I was telling Lime that of course she knows what the first word is.

1746
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:27,190
Who says that?

1747
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:28,290
I'm so dumb.

1748
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:29,170
Can I please buy an A?

1749
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:30,610
Oh my god, Matara!

1750
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:31,670
What?

1751
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:33,890
Let me spin my bunny!

1752
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:34,850
It's all I got!

1753
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:35,610
Okay.

1754
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:39,550
Furry far.

1755
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:40,350
No.

1756
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:41,210
Furry...

1757
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:41,930
jar.

1758
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:44,910
It's a place.

1759
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:45,910
It's a place.

1760
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:47,970
Furry jar.

1761
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:50,070
It could have been fairy.

1762
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:52,370
Furry...

1763
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:54,210
jar.

1764
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:56,070
Furry...

1765
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:56,730
jar.

1766
01:00:58,850 --> 01:00:59,670
Furry bar.

1767
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:00,570
Furry jar.

1768
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:01,650
Or furry yar.

1769
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:02,830
What is a yar?

1770
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,170
Please, I want to go!

1771
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:07,730
I know what this word is!

1772
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:09,270
Would you like to spin Matara?

1773
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:10,850
I mean, actually I don't even know.

1774
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:13,190
Do you want to just guess a letter or something?

1775
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1776
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:15,110
Hold on.

1777
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:16,890
It's either bar, car, or jar.

1778
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:18,330
Can it be a par?

1779
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:20,290
Okay, yeah.

1780
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:21,770
It's either bar, car, or jar.

1781
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:24,250
The logic!

1782
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:26,170
I've never heard of it!

1783
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,270
I don't know!

1784
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:31,750
Why are you laughing at me?

1785
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:31,970
Why are you laughing at me?

1786
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:32,530
Why are you laughing at me?

1787
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:32,630
Why are you laughing at me?

1788
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:36,390
Why are you laughing at me?

1789
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,770
Bar, car, or jar?

1790
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,250
Bar, car, or jar?

1791
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:43,390
Oh yeah, I can guess why.

1792
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:44,610
Why?

1793
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:44,910
Okay.

1794
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:46,310
Because that's not a vowel.

1795
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:48,150
Good guess, good guess.

1796
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:48,890
Good guess, good guess.

1797
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:51,910
Furry bar in...

1798
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:54,410
It's not...

1799
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:55,430
frog.

1800
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:58,450
It's not!

1801
01:01:58,690 --> 01:01:59,230
Please!

1802
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:02,330
I know what it is!

1803
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:04,950
It's a dog!

1804
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:07,150
I don't know how to put these letters!

1805
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:08,130
Zer...

1806
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:09,850
Er...

1807
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:11,050
Huh?

1808
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:13,930
There's no vowels left.

1809
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:14,950
You can guess anything.

1810
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:18,590
I don't understand how there's no vowels left.

1811
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:19,270
Do you want to spin?

1812
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:20,450
Do you want to spin?

1813
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:21,950
Spin the wheel.

1814
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:23,310
Spin the wheel.

1815
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,350
Spin the wheel.

1816
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:27,350
Oh my god!

1817
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:29,070
That was close!

1818
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:31,170
Oh my god!

1819
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:31,410
V!

1820
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:32,230
V!

1821
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:35,270
God dammit!

1822
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:36,530
Oh my god, guys!

1823
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:37,610
Is it car or bar?

1824
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:39,130
Oh my god!

1825
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:41,370
Spin the wheel!

1826
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:42,310
Okay, do it!

1827
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:43,210
50-50!

1828
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:44,670
No, no, no.

1829
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:47,630
It's gonna get a C.

1830
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:49,130
A C?

1831
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:50,890
Because then I know that it's chat.

1832
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:53,110
And then it's gonna tell me if it's bar or car.

1833
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:54,030
We spin again, right?

1834
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:55,110
Yeah, we spin.

1835
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:55,470
We spin.

1836
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:56,190
It's not bankruptcy.

1837
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:57,170
I'm gonna cry.

1838
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:00,970
Oh my god!

1839
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:02,570
You're so close!

1840
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:03,570
Alright, what do you want?

1841
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:04,410
A C?

1842
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:06,410
One C!

1843
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:09,290
Furry bar in JVR!

1844
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:13,770
Furry bar in JVR!

1845
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:15,630
Furry bar in JVR!

1846
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,370
I was not getting it, you guys.

1847
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:20,510
There is nothing.

1848
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:22,130
I do not play VR.

1849
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:24,310
I do not read that.

1850
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:26,170
These faces on the internet.

1851
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:28,150
I was not getting it.

1852
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:29,330
I'm so sorry.

1853
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:30,270
I apologize.

1854
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:32,570
It took literally until...

1855
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:34,530
Furry car in VR chat.

1856
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:41,270
It was not clicking for me at all.

1857
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:43,670
It took until one letter was away.

1858
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:45,570
It took until one letter was away.

1859
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:46,830
I was like, is it bar or car?

1860
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,110
I was like, is it bar or car?

1861
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:50,430
We're just min-maxing the farming.

1862
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:50,950
Yeah!

1863
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,730
Look how much money you got.

1864
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:55,030
What a strat.

1865
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:57,970
I'm still third.

1866
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:00,870
One second.

1867
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:06,630
Check the DMs.

1868
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:09,030
Check the DMs?

1869
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:09,350
Yeah.

1870
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:12,150
Sure.

1871
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:13,450
Oh, sorry.

1872
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:15,530
I don't know why it keeps doing that to you.

1873
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:18,510
You keep becoming tickled.

1874
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:19,890
You keep getting censored.

1875
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:23,770
What were they doing behind that censor bar?

1876
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:24,550
We'll never know.

1877
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:26,750
We went to a furry bar in VR chat.

1878
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:27,630
Sorry, I mean a furry car.

1879
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:30,930
A furry jar in VR chat.

1880
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:31,750
In Prague.

1881
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:34,490
Furry bar in Prague.

1882
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:39,830
Where did you get the frog from?

1883
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:48,430
Is a furry jar like a swear jar where whenever you have furry tendencies you have to put money into it?

1884
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:52,130
Oh, that must happen a lot in VR chat.

1885
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:53,230
Probably, right?

1886
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:57,750
I legitimately was not understanding what the word can be.

1887
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,350
I was like, why is there no word?

1888
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:01,230
I was in so much pain.

1889
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:02,490
I was like, please.

1890
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:07,190
Cool.

1891
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,830
Let's go on to our next round.

1892
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:12,230
Now Matara's on the board.

1893
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:13,650
Oh my god.

1894
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:15,230
She went third place.

1895
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:16,430
How did she actually win this?

1896
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:18,530
From third place to third place.

1897
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:19,130
Matara gone.

1898
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:21,950
What the fuck is this word?

1899
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:25,110
This one is a phrase.

1900
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:27,950
Sorry.

1901
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:30,370
Since Matara.

1902
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:32,290
Since Matara won.

1903
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:33,770
We'll start with Croaky.

1904
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:38,370
Here, we'll spin the wheel for you.

1905
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:39,810
Use your brain cells.

1906
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:41,590
Oh, L.

1907
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:45,090
Is there an L on the board?

1908
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:47,310
Is there an L on the board?

1909
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:48,510
A single L.

1910
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:49,650
I knew it would work.

1911
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:51,710
I knew it.

1912
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:53,630
Spin that wheel.

1913
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:55,050
She did it, finally.

1914
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:59,550
You know what I'm going to do, Matara?

1915
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:01,230
I know what I'm going to do.

1916
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:02,610
No, don't do that.

1917
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:04,270
I'm going to take it.

1918
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,570
I'm going to take it.

1919
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:08,190
I pick M.

1920
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:09,170
M.

1921
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:17,790
Is there an M on the board?

1922
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:20,450
Is there an M on the board?

1923
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:21,030
The one time.

1924
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,170
There's an M?

1925
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:23,810
You get it.

1926
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:27,570
The one time you could have gotten M, I took it from you.

1927
01:06:27,770 --> 01:06:29,010
I'm sweating right now, you guys.

1928
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:29,510
I'm sweating.

1929
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:32,890
Alright.

1930
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:34,610
Do you want to spin or buy a vowel?

1931
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:35,510
Buy a vowel.

1932
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:36,490
Spin that wheel.

1933
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:38,630
Spin that wheel.

1934
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:39,430
Spin that wheel.

1935
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:40,370
Hey, I'm gonna get bankrupt from here.

1936
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:40,830
I feel it.

1937
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:42,950
Oh, that's close.

1938
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:44,230
Manifesting.

1939
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:48,750
Okay, this is a little more difficult.

1940
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:50,750
Chat is too smart.

1941
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:51,330
Buy a vowel!

1942
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:52,750
Buy a vowel.

1943
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,330
I can't buy a vowel!

1944
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:55,290
Yes you can!

1945
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:56,090
You have money!

1946
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:07,050
I don't know what that word is.

1947
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:08,050
Can I do T?

1948
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:08,870
T!

1949
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:12,750
Three!

1950
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,850
I know what it is!

1951
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:16,830
I know what it is!

1952
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:19,630
I know what it is!

1953
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,270
Oh my god!

1954
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:25,370
Wait!

1955
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:29,650
That is a Metal Gear reference.

1956
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,390
Tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink!

1957
01:07:40,910 --> 01:07:41,490
Tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink!

1958
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:42,450
Tink, tink, tink, tink, tink!

1959
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:42,730
Tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink!

1960
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:45,250
No!

1961
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,550
The forbidden crow knowledge.

1962
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:49,810
Cause that's metal!

1963
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:52,830
And then I didn't know what the other sentences were until...

1964
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:56,650
I mean, as soon as the word metal was fucking clear, we all knew what it was.

1965
01:07:56,810 --> 01:08:03,570
As soon as the word metal was clear, I was like that's metal, but then when I got T and then there was two Ts at the top I was like, oh...

1966
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:05,910
That is a Metal Gear reference.

1967
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:07,790
Nobody else even got to play!

1968
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:14,830
You did it!

1969
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:18,390
I could have spun more if I was like, no, this is guaranteed to win.

1970
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:20,050
Oh my god.

1971
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:22,090
Thank you for not drawing out my agony.

1972
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:24,150
I was like, oh no, I'm gonna have to watch your farm every fucking day.

1973
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:25,550
I thought you were gonna farm!

1974
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:26,190
Seriously.

1975
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:29,350
Who would do that, right?

1976
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:30,870
Farm every letter?

1977
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:32,790
Nobody would do that.

1978
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:33,170
That's cringe.

1979
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:36,470
I knew what the pain was, so I didn't do that.

1980
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:39,470
You're out here like, hmm, could it be Metal Fear?

1981
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:41,890
Could it be Metal Tear?

1982
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:42,710
I don't know.

1983
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:44,270
Metal Bear?

1984
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:46,110
Metal Jar?

1985
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:47,290
Frog?

1986
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:52,150
Oh, please!

1987
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:56,050
My biggest fear is for people to find out how dumb I am.

1988
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:57,910
No!

1989
01:08:58,550 --> 01:08:59,850
No, Madara!

1990
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:02,750
It's okay, I forgot O was a vowel!

1991
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:09,130
Alrighty.

1992
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:15,830
We have one final commercial break before we go to our final round.

1993
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:17,450
Yoki in the lead.

1994
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:21,050
And let's go to our last commercial break.

1995
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:22,510
Don't leave everybody!

1996
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:24,110
Don't leave!

1997
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:26,410
We'll be back after these messages.

1998
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:27,230
Don't skipa!

1999
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:29,170
No skippa!

2000
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:30,810
Here we go.

2001
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:33,350
We're six doors.

2002
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:35,390
We're just one.

2003
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:36,550
So many commercials!

2004
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:38,470
What else is on?

2005
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:41,130
See all of this?

2006
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:44,670
This is your future.

2007
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:45,830
Welcome to your future.

2008
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:52,210
S-C-S-A-M A-M Super College and Melons.

2009
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:05,970
Good evening everyone.

2010
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:09,070
And welcome back to Who Wants to be a Millionaire?

2011
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:12,150
We are here with our contestant Frogbert.

2012
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:16,650
And they are on their final question of the night.

2013
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:21,270
The question that will determine if they become a millionaire.

2014
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:23,150
How are you feeling tonight, Frogbert?

2015
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:24,410
Narrator?

2016
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:26,410
I'm feeling good.

2017
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:31,670
I'm feeling like a million bucks are about to go in my pocket.

2018
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:34,890
Oh yes, we can tell he is ready.

2019
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:37,370
I'm just going to cut you off right there, buddy.

2020
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:39,950
Because I don't want to waste any more time.

2021
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,810
I know our audience is so excited.

2022
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:44,290
I know you're so excited.

2023
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:47,350
I'm getting heart palpitations.

2024
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:54,510
So, let us let us do our final question of the night.

2025
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:55,530
Are you ready?

2026
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:58,650
Okay.

2027
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:01,530
Here is your final question, Frogbert.

2028
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,630
The final question is...

2029
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:11,710
What is Mint's announcement?

2030
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:15,610
And your options are... A.

2031
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:17,550
A baby.

2032
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:19,610
B.

2033
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:22,970
What she's going to have for dinner tonight.

2034
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:25,050
C.

2035
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:27,330
Another announcement.

2036
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:29,430
Or...

2037
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:30,370
D.

2038
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:33,410
A collab with Pitbull.

2039
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:34,970
Mr. Worldwide.

2040
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:39,670
Hmm...

2041
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:42,530
Hmm...

2042
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:42,590
Hmm...

2043
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:43,910
A.

2044
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:44,470
B.

2045
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:44,970
C.

2046
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:45,390
Or D.

2047
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:47,930
I'm thinking A.

2048
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:51,650
Because it does not say what kind of a baby.

2049
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:53,990
What if it's a food baby?

2050
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,670
Is that your final answer?

2051
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:58,190
Yes, that is my final answer.

2052
01:11:59,030 --> 01:11:59,630
Okay.

2053
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:06,950
Final answer.

2054
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:07,870
A.

2055
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:09,430
A baby.

2056
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:18,690
We will find out if you'll become a millionaire after this commercial break!

2057
01:12:18,970 --> 01:12:20,570
Don't you step away, folks!

2058
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:26,650
We're going to come back shortly and see if Frogbert wins this one million dollars!

2059
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:28,830
See you in a few minutes!

2060
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:32,430
I think I'm right.

2061
01:12:33,730 --> 01:12:35,470
I don't think so.

2062
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:37,930
Hey you!

2063
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:40,550
Are you currently watching this magic box?

2064
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:42,070
Do you like ghosts?

2065
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:43,770
Do you like maids?

2066
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:45,610
Do you like ghost maids?

2067
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:47,450
Do you like Mint Phantom?

2068
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:51,030
What about Mint Phantom the same but slightly different?

2069
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:52,630
That's right, folks!

2070
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:55,590
Introducing Mint Phantom 3.0!

2071
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,910
A whole new model!

2072
01:12:58,490 --> 01:13:00,650
We have a lore video!

2073
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:02,850
We have a stream!

2074
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:04,310
We have a reveal!

2075
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:08,410
We have other surprises for you to gander at!

2076
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:11,890
That's right, Mint Phantom 3.0!

2077
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:13,350
Brand new model!

2078
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:16,250
And when will this be revealed, you ask?

2079
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:20,610
Well, it will be revealed this All Hallows' Eve!

2080
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:23,830
That's right, Halloween night!

2081
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:27,730
October 31st!

2082
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:29,650
Uh, you heard it here first.

2083
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:34,090
Folks, October 31st is Mint Phantom 3.0!

2084
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:38,790
New model, new rigging, whole new look, except not really.

2085
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:41,550
Come and join in on the fun today!

2086
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:43,690
And see you then!

2087
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:47,290
October 31st, 7pm EST!

2088
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,130
Ah!

2089
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,040
Oh, there we go.

2090
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,140
Hey!

2091
01:13:58,790 --> 01:13:59,330
Oh!

2092
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:00,970
Uh, uh...

2093
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:02,190
Uh...

2094
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:04,890
Uh, hold on.

2095
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:10,230
Uh...

2096
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:10,870
Ah!

2097
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:11,670
Uh...

2098
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:12,030
Ah!

2099
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,050
Uh...

2100
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:18,130
Oh...

2101
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:19,270
Uh...

2102
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:28,980
Yay!

2103
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,020
Mint 3.0 debut!

2104
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:38,400
Yay!

2105
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:41,980
Yay!

2106
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,120
Yay!

2107
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:44,840
Yay!

2108
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:48,540
Um...

2109
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:48,940
Um...

2110
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,040
Man, that sure had a lot of commercials!

2111
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:54,060
Hahaha!

2112
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:59,920
I hope you guys didn't get sick of all those commercials!

2113
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:00,900
Hahaha!

2114
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:04,280
A baby!

2115
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:05,820
It could...

2116
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:06,860
It could have been a food baby.

2117
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,340
Didn't say what kind of baby.

2118
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,520
Yay!

2119
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,940
Da-dun!

2120
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:15,940
Da-dun!

2121
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:16,900
Da-dun!

2122
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:17,320
Da -dun!

2123
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:19,020
Um...

2124
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:21,640
Yeah, I'll have the waiting room up for that.

2125
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:23,460
Uh...

2126
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:25,580
After this stream!

2127
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:26,400
Hahaha!

2128
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,280
And, um...

2129
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,640
Yeah!

2130
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:33,980
Oh gosh, I'm nervous all of a sudden.

2131
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:35,240
Because I planned everything.

2132
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:37,740
And I didn't plan up to here.

2133
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:38,460
Hahaha!

2134
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,000
I planned everything else!

2135
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:44,580
Until up until this point!

2136
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:44,980
Hahaha!

2137
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:47,340
Whoa!

2138
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:50,280
Skip commercial!

2139
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:50,680
No!

2140
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,460
Did Frogbert win?

2141
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,240
I don't know!

2142
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,660
Put it back on Wheel of Fortune!

2143
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,800
Thank you to, um...

2144
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:07,140
Matara and Doki and Lime for joining me for my silly, um...

2145
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,420
My silly...

2146
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:11,080
Uh...

2147
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,200
Wheel of Fortune game.

2148
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:14,760
I hope you guys liked it too.

2149
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:17,820
And, um...

2150
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:18,080
Yeah!

2151
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:19,380
Surprise!

2152
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:21,520
Yeah!

2153
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:25,240
It's kind of the same.

2154
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:26,680
But not really!

2155
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:27,960
Hahaha!

2156
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,420
And, um...

2157
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:33,420
Basically I was like...

2158
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,080
Um...

2159
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,040
How do I say?

2160
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:39,500
Sorry, I'm really nervous all of a sudden.

2161
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:40,120
Oh gosh.

2162
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:43,740
Um...

2163
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:44,640
Um...

2164
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:46,540
Sorry!

2165
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:47,280
Oh gosh!

2166
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:48,320
I'm really nervous!

2167
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,040
Hahaha!

2168
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,420
I kind of...

2169
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,400
I call it 3.0 debut.

2170
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,480
But it's really, to me, like a re-debut.

2171
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,560
When I first debuted...

2172
01:16:58,560 --> 01:16:59,980
Ever, ever...

2173
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:03,220
I never had like a lore video or...

2174
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:06,060
Never really kind of did a proper debut, I guess.

2175
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,200
So, uh...

2176
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,320
Did Doki win?

2177
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:09,500
You'll have to see!

2178
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:13,320
You can get early access to 3.0 if you pre-order.

2179
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:13,960
Hahaha!

2180
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:15,400
Yeah, pre-order.

2181
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:16,480
Something.

2182
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:18,900
Download more RAM.

2183
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,380
Pre-order the RAM and you'll get access.

2184
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:22,300
Hahaha!

2185
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:25,420
Um...

2186
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:27,320
Yeah, thank you for all the birthday wishes!

2187
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,040
And, um...

2188
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,500
And, uh...

2189
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:35,320
I have lots of stuff planned for 3.0.

2190
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:36,480
Um...

2191
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,680
And it's on Halloween.

2192
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:39,860
So I'm very excited about that.

2193
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,860
It was actually initially gonna be for today.

2194
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:42,600
Hahaha!

2195
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:44,980
But, um...

2196
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:48,470
To make it easier on everybody...

2197
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:51,420
I pushed it to the 31st.

2198
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:55,560
Because otherwise everybody would be scrambling.

2199
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:57,800
And, um...

2200
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,620
And, uh...

2201
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:00,600
Um...

2202
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:01,920
But yeah, I kind of...

2203
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:02,800
Um...

2204
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,300
Wanted it to be like a new...

2205
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:06,540
Um...

2206
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:09,140
A new start in a way.

2207
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:10,940
Um...

2208
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:12,620
If you're kind of like...

2209
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:13,140
Wow...

2210
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:15,980
I wonder when Minto's getting a new...

2211
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:17,340
Or getting a 3D...

2212
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:20,000
Well, this has kind of been part of what's...

2213
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:22,000
Been holding me up.

2214
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:22,580
Hahaha!

2215
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:26,900
So...

2216
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:28,660
Um...

2217
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:29,880
To a new beginning!

2218
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:30,300
Yeah!

2219
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:32,680
But I didn't want to change too much.

2220
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,020
So as you can tell...

2221
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,980
From the little hidden bits...

2222
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:38,040
I mean the...

2223
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,620
The showing bits...

2224
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:40,100
Hahaha!

2225
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,160
It's pretty much the same.

2226
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,180
But there are...

2227
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:45,500
Some differences.

2228
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,840
And if you guys are good...

2229
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,080
I might give you a little sneak peek.

2230
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:51,440
Later.

2231
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,220
At the end of the stream, maybe.

2232
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,440
A little bit of a sneak peek.

2233
01:18:59,520 --> 01:18:59,980
Maybe.

2234
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,260
It's also not done.

2235
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:03,180
Hahaha!

2236
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:05,940
It's also...

2237
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:07,800
Not done.

2238
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:08,560
So...

2239
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:11,500
Yeah...

2240
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:12,780
But um...

2241
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:16,580
Yeah, please be good.

2242
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,080
Peek.

2243
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,300
A snake peek?

2244
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:20,780
No.

2245
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:22,400
Oh gosh!

2246
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,880
I'm glad that the...

2247
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:27,340
Wheel of Fortune stuff worked out.

2248
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,860
And that I could switch to...

2249
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:30,020
Did you guys like my commercials?

2250
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:31,420
Hahaha!

2251
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,800
Thank you for all the super chats!

2252
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,540
I really, really appreciate it!

2253
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:37,520
Thank you!

2254
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:41,160
I'm gonna bring the Minto 3D concert tickets.

2255
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,980
Will Mitten 3.0...

2256
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:50,160
Fix the hates chat bug?

2257
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:50,940
Hahaha!

2258
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:53,220
It's weird calling it 3.0.

2259
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,160
Because...

2260
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:56,960
It's kinda... I don't know if you can tell...

2261
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,400
My first two models were...

2262
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,620
Were...

2263
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:01,620
KGR Mama.

2264
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,380
But maybe...

2265
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,380
This is a different Mama.

2266
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:08,680
So it feels weird, you know?

2267
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:09,280
Hahaha!

2268
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,760
To say 3.0.

2269
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:14,200
It's kind of like saying...

2270
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,100
Saying...

2271
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:17,240
Re-debut.

2272
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:19,600
And I also...

2273
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:21,040
I...

2274
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:23,080
I...

2275
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:25,460
What was I gonna say?

2276
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,300
Um...

2277
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:32,120
Um...

2278
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:34,400
Happy birthday Minto!

2279
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,000
Thank you!

2280
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:36,980
Ah...

2281
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:39,500
I can't remember.

2282
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:40,840
My mind is so blank.

2283
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:42,680
Sorry, I also have really bad jet lag.

2284
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:43,340
Hahaha!

2285
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:46,120
Um...

2286
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,800
But there are some things that are different.

2287
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:48,380
Oh!

2288
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:51,740
I feel weird about, like, making a big deal out of...

2289
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:55,180
Debuting a model that...

2290
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:57,480
You kind of already know what it looks like.

2291
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:58,880
Because, like I said, it looks the same.

2292
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,060
But not really.

2293
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:02,120
But...

2294
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:03,220
Um...

2295
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:04,340
Uh...

2296
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:06,240
There will be new rigging.

2297
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,160
And...

2298
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:08,300
Um...

2299
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:10,000
New stuff.

2300
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:10,800
So...

2301
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:11,680
Um...

2302
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:14,200
I hope you guys like it.

2303
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,120
I really like it so far.

2304
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:17,660
I can't...

2305
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:19,820
I'm so excited to use it.

2306
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:21,600
I thank you guys.

2307
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,300
If you haven't already fallen in love with me...

2308
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:27,220
You'll fall in love with me...

2309
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:29,240
After you see me next!

2310
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:29,880
Hahaha!

2311
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:30,140
Hahaha!

2312
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:30,760
Hahaha!

2313
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,420
You'll be like, wow, wait a second.

2314
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:35,800
I think Min's kind of cute.

2315
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:36,580
Hahaha!

2316
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,740
Do you know the mama?

2317
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:42,780
Yeah, I know the mama.

2318
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:43,680
Hahaha!

2319
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:44,860
What do you mean?

2320
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:47,720
Oh my gosh, what if I, like, ask someone random?

2321
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:51,600
Can you ask someone to make me a model?

2322
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:52,280
Hahaha!

2323
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,980
And make my new body.

2324
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:56,800
And...

2325
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:57,800
Um...

2326
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:01,160
Don't tell me.

2327
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:02,580
It'll be a surprise.

2328
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:04,080
Hahaha!

2329
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:10,140
It's the mama gotcha.

2330
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:12,900
Yeah.

2331
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:15,940
So maybe actually Frogbert was right.

2332
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:17,060
It's a baby!

2333
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:18,120
And it's me!

2334
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,900
I'm the baby!

2335
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:20,840
Hahaha!

2336
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:22,740
I'm

2337
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:29,520
the baby!

2338
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:30,300
Hahaha!

2339
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:36,790
Yeah, maybe he did win.

2340
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:39,830
I said on Twitter...

2341
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:41,470
Whoever wins...

2342
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:43,090
Whatever option wins will be...

2343
01:22:43,090 --> 01:22:44,590
Or whatever gets first will win.

2344
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:47,350
But that also just means...

2345
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:48,730
Whatever places first...

2346
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:49,290
Wins!

2347
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:50,110
Hahaha!

2348
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:53,950
Never said it would come true!

2349
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:55,830
I just said it would win!

2350
01:22:57,350 --> 01:22:58,110
That's it!

2351
01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:01,310
I'm the baby!

2352
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:02,390
Hahaha!

2353
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:05,230
New model baby.

2354
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:06,050
Actually...

2355
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:07,790
I'm not gonna lie.

2356
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:09,970
My new look is very baby.

2357
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:10,710
Hahaha!

2358
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:12,790
My cheeks are really round!

2359
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:16,670
I think it might be my favorite part.

2360
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:17,990
Probably.

2361
01:23:18,170 --> 01:23:18,530
Maybe.

2362
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:22,070
Nah, I have a lot of favorite parts.

2363
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:23,590
I can't wait to show you guys.

2364
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:25,030
Um...

2365
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:27,330
Me and my mama, we really cooked.

2366
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:28,890
So...

2367
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:30,090
Um...

2368
01:23:31,010 --> 01:23:31,570
Yeah.

2369
01:23:33,850 --> 01:23:34,410
Um...

2370
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:35,870
Yeah, I'm so excited.

2371
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:36,570
I've been...

2372
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:40,170
Really looking forward to this.

2373
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:41,430
It took a bit of waiting.

2374
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:43,350
Um...

2375
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:45,990
My mama was busy with...

2376
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:47,190
Deadlines.

2377
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:48,010
Hahaha!

2378
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:50,450
And then...

2379
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:53,170
Will new Minto be able to CQC?

2380
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:54,210
Maybe!

2381
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:55,830
Actually, probably!

2382
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:58,570
Congratulations on the baby!

2383
01:23:58,910 --> 01:23:59,750
Thank you!

2384
01:24:00,230 --> 01:24:00,870
Hahaha!

2385
01:24:03,770 --> 01:24:04,450
Yeah!

2386
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:05,590
So...

2387
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:06,330
Aw, man!

2388
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:09,630
Um...

2389
01:24:09,630 --> 01:24:11,170
I'm so excited.

2390
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:12,210
Uh...

2391
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:17,270
And then I will have more things on the 3.0 date.

2392
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:18,050
So...

2393
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:20,010
October 31st!

2394
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:22,070
I'm so excited for Halloween!

2395
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:23,370
Hahaha!

2396
01:24:24,410 --> 01:24:26,150
I hope you guys are excited.

2397
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:29,310
Oh gosh, like I said, it's kind of awkward because it really is...

2398
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:30,790
The same outfit.

2399
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:32,150
It's not like a new outfit or anything.

2400
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:33,310
I'm really sorry about that.

2401
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:35,870
But, you know, I'm like making merch and everything.

2402
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:38,550
And before anybody even gets my merch...

2403
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:40,930
I didn't want to have a new whole look.

2404
01:24:41,130 --> 01:24:41,590
So...

2405
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:43,110
But!

2406
01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:44,030
Um...

2407
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:49,330
New outfits will happen from now on with new mama.

2408
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:51,370
So...

2409
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:51,790
Um...

2410
01:24:51,790 --> 01:24:54,730
My old model...

2411
01:24:54,730 --> 01:24:56,410
You probably won't see it anymore.

2412
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:57,910
The one that... Not this one!

2413
01:24:59,310 --> 01:24:59,890
Hahaha!

2414
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:01,570
But...

2415
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:03,530
My normal...

2416
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:05,530
My normal...

2417
01:25:07,090 --> 01:25:08,850
Self that I use.

2418
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:10,630
So 2.0.

2419
01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:13,890
But I think once you see the new one...

2420
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:15,730
I think you'll be like...

2421
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:17,170
Okay.

2422
01:25:17,390 --> 01:25:18,690
I understand.

2423
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:19,770
Hahaha!

2424
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:21,410
I think you'll understand.

2425
01:25:23,010 --> 01:25:23,670
I think.

2426
01:25:23,890 --> 01:25:25,790
And who knows?

2427
01:25:25,790 --> 01:25:28,890
Who's to say that I won't remake 1.0 in the future?

2428
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:29,550
But with...

2429
01:25:30,110 --> 01:25:30,890
New mama.

2430
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:31,510
You know?

2431
01:25:32,690 --> 01:25:34,090
I almost said the name.

2432
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:34,570
Hahaha!

2433
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:38,350
Yeah, so...

2434
01:25:39,450 --> 01:25:39,930
Hmm...

2435
01:25:44,230 --> 01:25:45,950
Taking bets she will have a nose?

2436
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:47,190
I'm pretty sure she has a nose.

2437
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:47,790
Pretty sure.

2438
01:25:50,490 --> 01:25:50,970
Ah!

2439
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:53,290
But I'll keep... I'll keep...

2440
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:54,110
Um...

2441
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:55,970
Besides the little...

2442
01:25:55,970 --> 01:25:57,790
Preview I show you guys today.

2443
01:25:58,010 --> 01:25:58,650
If you're good.

2444
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:00,910
If you're... If you're dandy.

2445
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:04,550
Um...

2446
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:06,050
Uh...

2447
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:06,450
Then...

2448
01:26:06,450 --> 01:26:07,310
Then...

2449
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:11,730
I'll keep it mostly secret until the day of.

2450
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,330
So sorry you have to wait like a whole month.

2451
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:14,010
Hahaha!

2452
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:17,190
But I also have to wait a whole month so...

2453
01:26:17,190 --> 01:26:19,510
I'm probably more impatient than you guys.

2454
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:23,590
I'm more impatient than you!

2455
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:25,190
Um...

2456
01:26:25,190 --> 01:26:26,630
But yeah...

2457
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:29,130
So... Did you guys like my commercials?

2458
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:30,170
Here, let's uh...

2459
01:26:30,170 --> 01:26:31,950
Let's bring them up since I...

2460
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:33,630
Made them.

2461
01:26:34,210 --> 01:26:34,850
Hahaha!

2462
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:39,850
So first commercial we had was...

2463
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:42,290
The mall.

2464
01:26:43,090 --> 01:26:44,430
The mall commercial.

2465
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:46,510
And...

2466
01:26:46,510 --> 01:26:47,330
Hold on.

2467
01:26:50,270 --> 01:26:51,010
One second.

2468
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:52,190
Oop.

2469
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:53,610
Oop.

2470
01:26:53,610 --> 01:26:53,830
Oop.

2471
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:54,290
Hold on.

2472
01:26:54,390 --> 01:26:55,650
Why isn't it not letting me?

2473
01:26:55,770 --> 01:26:56,190
There we go.

2474
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:01,620
Hahaha!

2475
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,080
Did you guys like this one?

2476
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:03,960
Hahaha!

2477
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:05,700
Oh, hold on.

2478
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:07,680
Let me... Let me make it so I can hear it.

2479
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:09,240
I'll tell you...

2480
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,200
My thought process.

2481
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,080
Um... Which was...

2482
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:14,820
Um...

2483
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:16,880
Trying to make this as accurate as possible.

2484
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:19,440
I was even gonna like remake the backgrounds and everything.

2485
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:20,460
But I ran out of time.

2486
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:23,040
Also, that's me.

2487
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,500
Doing the...

2488
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,540
Can you tell?

2489
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:27,140
That's me.

2490
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:32,320
That probably was the hardest part about this whole thing.

2491
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:34,860
Doing the...

2492
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:36,020
The beatbox.

2493
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:38,560
And trying to make it...

2494
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:40,940
As off sync as the original.

2495
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:49,140
So the original was...

2496
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:49,400
Hold on.

2497
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:51,520
Was...

2498
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:53,980
Uh...

2499
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:56,420
What did she say here?

2500
01:27:58,240 --> 01:27:59,020
Wait...

2501
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:00,520
Uh...

2502
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:01,480
What did she say there?

2503
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:03,900
Oh!

2504
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:04,420
Denim!

2505
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:05,420
Hahaha!

2506
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:07,440
Instead I said...

2507
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,100
And this one was...

2508
01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:12,140
But instead it's...

2509
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:13,220
Hahaha!

2510
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,940
Sorry, I'm laughing at my own jokes.

2511
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:17,620
Hahaha!

2512
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:20,680
And then this one's...

2513
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:21,660
Backpacks!

2514
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:22,360
Backpacks!

2515
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:24,180
Backpacks!

2516
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:24,680
Backpacks!

2517
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:26,580
Backpacks!

2518
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:28,100
And this one is...

2519
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:28,920
Boots and pants.

2520
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:30,320
But I just thought...

2521
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,020
Boots and cats?

2522
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,020
That's how you actually beatbox!

2523
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,820
With boots and cats and boots and cats.

2524
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,080
And so...

2525
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:36,900
Boots and cats.

2526
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:38,400
Instead of boots and pants.

2527
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:42,560
This one is the one I'm most impressed with.

2528
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,040
I did this in one take.

2529
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:45,320
And it's so...

2530
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,080
Actually, I did all of these without watching the video.

2531
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,500
So I would watch it...

2532
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,600
And then go and record...

2533
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,420
And mimic the actions without watching.

2534
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:54,920
Like I would just...

2535
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,640
I sat in a room and just went...

2536
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,340
Without any audio or anything...

2537
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:00,040
I was just like...

2538
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:01,280
I would go...

2539
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:04,920
And then I would do...

2540
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:06,960
And I did...

2541
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,260
I think like two times or something.

2542
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,440
And so this one...

2543
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,500
The fact that I got it so perfectly synced...

2544
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:15,280
Kind of makes me...

2545
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,480
Go bonkers.

2546
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:20,080
Like even when I go back!

2547
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:22,220
How did I time that so perfectly?

2548
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:23,520
Maybe a genius.

2549
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:29,440
That one is my favorite.

2550
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,120
Because the girl is just like...

2551
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,580
Get yourself an outfit!

2552
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:40,060
It's my most accurate one.

2553
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:45,020
And then this one I had to...

2554
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:45,760
So...

2555
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,320
They even have like a cut in the background.

2556
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:52,340
And so I simulated that as well.

2557
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,260
And you can hear me being like...

2558
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:55,160
Get yourself...

2559
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:57,780
And then I was like...

2560
01:29:57,780 --> 01:29:58,660
Get yourself...

2561
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:08,700
That's that commercial.

2562
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:12,020
And then of course the one for the happy coat.

2563
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:14,460
I filmed that.

2564
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:17,980
I filmed this.

2565
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:19,200
It's a little wide.

2566
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:20,800
Because I filmed it on my phone.

2567
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:26,820
And I had to squish it to fit.

2568
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,640
So it looks more like that.

2569
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:29,220
Actually.

2570
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:32,160
It looks more like that.

2571
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:33,220
In the video.

2572
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,580
Because you had to make sure you could see it.

2573
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:37,140
Um...

2574
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:39,100
To...

2575
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,140
To know.

2576
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,900
And then I drew the butt.

2577
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:46,840
But I didn't realize it would bleed through.

2578
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:48,160
So actually also.

2579
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,620
This had no script or anything.

2580
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:53,840
Can you tell?

2581
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:55,940
Can you tell it had no script?

2582
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,300
That I just made this all up by myself.

2583
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:59,820
In my brain at the moment.

2584
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:01,560
It's not divine.

2585
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:03,800
Actually.

2586
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,480
Actually the only one with a script.

2587
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:09,520
Was the mall one.

2588
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:12,880
And then it kept turning sideways.

2589
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:13,860
I was getting annoyed.

2590
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:15,580
And that's real.

2591
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:16,580
That's not CGI.

2592
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:21,580
That actually happened.

2593
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:24,220
That actually happened.

2594
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:25,260
The fire is real.

2595
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:28,620
No weighing right now.

2596
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,960
I'm also kind of obsessed with these frogs.

2597
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:33,340
I don't know if you can tell.

2598
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:34,120
But I really like them.

2599
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:36,520
Leo get the happy coat.

2600
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:37,480
Please.

2601
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:39,920
Go to yeahlights.

2602
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:41,100
Wait.

2603
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:42,900
Where is it?

2604
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:44,080
Yeahlights.com.

2605
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:46,320
Pre-order my happy coat.

2606
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:48,100
Please.

2607
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:48,500
Please.

2608
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:48,880
Please.

2609
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:51,260
It even comes with this little nifty.

2610
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,180
Like waist coat tie.

2611
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:54,160
It's very cute.

2612
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,280
It matches.

2613
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:56,200
Everything is cute.

2614
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:56,780
It's very.

2615
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:57,900
It's very.

2616
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:00,260
Soft and nice.

2617
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:02,020
It's so high quality.

2618
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,740
As you can tell from the video.

2619
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:05,060
Today.

2620
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:06,040
Today.

2621
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:10,480
Yeah.

2622
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:12,340
My first ever official merch.

2623
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:13,320
Oh don't look at that part.

2624
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:18,100
So that was the happy coat.

2625
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:18,820
Commercial.

2626
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,080
And then the last commercial.

2627
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:22,680
Which was a several commercials.

2628
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:23,500
But this one.

2629
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:26,280
You could stop at five or six stores.

2630
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,440
Or just one.

2631
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:33,910
You could.

2632
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:34,270
Oh wait.

2633
01:32:34,430 --> 01:32:38,110
You could stop at five or six stores.

2634
01:32:38,150 --> 01:32:39,670
I forgot to do like you know how they go.

2635
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:41,810
The five or six stores or just one.

2636
01:32:41,810 --> 01:32:43,430
And then they do the little thing.

2637
01:32:43,570 --> 01:32:44,350
And then they say like.

2638
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:47,230
I'm a disappointment to my parents.

2639
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:51,910
I forgot to say the last bit.

2640
01:32:52,730 --> 01:32:54,130
And then also this one.

2641
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:56,690
The scam.

2642
01:32:56,970 --> 01:32:58,650
Sorry no SCAM college.

2643
01:32:59,110 --> 01:32:59,770
Sorry wait.

2644
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:02,710
The college of melons.

2645
01:33:05,090 --> 01:33:05,610
This.

2646
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:08,750
This is your.

2647
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:10,510
So.

2648
01:33:11,810 --> 01:33:13,070
I did this.

2649
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:14,350
Both in two takes.

2650
01:33:15,210 --> 01:33:15,990
One take.

2651
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:17,170
The one.

2652
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:18,150
And then the other take.

2653
01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:20,650
And then I forgot what I said the second time.

2654
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:21,690
Which is why.

2655
01:33:23,350 --> 01:33:24,670
It didn't sync.

2656
01:33:27,510 --> 01:33:29,090
It didn't sync cause I.

2657
01:33:29,130 --> 01:33:30,510
Welcome to your future.

2658
01:33:32,450 --> 01:33:32,930
SCAM.

2659
01:33:32,990 --> 01:33:34,150
So at the very beginning.

2660
01:33:34,170 --> 01:33:35,690
I say like this is your future.

2661
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:38,110
And then the other one says welcome to your future.

2662
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:39,250
SCAM.

2663
01:33:41,810 --> 01:33:43,150
This is your future.

2664
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:44,290
Welcome to your future.

2665
01:33:46,190 --> 01:33:46,790
SCAM.

2666
01:33:48,270 --> 01:33:49,470
Super college.

2667
01:33:49,630 --> 01:33:50,570
And melons.

2668
01:33:50,970 --> 01:33:53,250
But I was really impressed that I got the.

2669
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:55,070
The super college part.

2670
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:58,090
Or wait was it the SCAM part.

2671
01:33:58,530 --> 01:33:59,550
Oh where did it go.

2672
01:33:59,830 --> 01:34:00,210
SCAM.

2673
01:34:01,130 --> 01:34:02,130
Super college.

2674
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:04,010
Yeah I got the super college in sync.

2675
01:34:04,490 --> 01:34:06,250
So that's kind of awesome.

2676
01:34:07,710 --> 01:34:08,310
Yeah.

2677
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:08,430
Yeah.

2678
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:11,390
First try baby.

2679
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:12,610
First try.

2680
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:20,810
But um.

2681
01:34:21,690 --> 01:34:23,750
And then the last one.

2682
01:34:24,110 --> 01:34:25,790
How can a ghost have a birthday.

2683
01:34:26,090 --> 01:34:27,130
It's my death day.

2684
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:29,490
But I say birthday to make it easy for you guys.

2685
01:34:29,550 --> 01:34:29,810
Okay.

2686
01:34:31,370 --> 01:34:32,430
What's the announcement.

2687
01:34:34,190 --> 01:34:34,710
Me.

2688
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:36,950
I'm the announcement.

2689
01:34:40,230 --> 01:34:41,630
I'm the announcement.

2690
01:34:43,290 --> 01:34:44,570
And um.

2691
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:46,450
And then.

2692
01:34:46,830 --> 01:34:48,350
And then.

2693
01:34:49,410 --> 01:34:50,290
And then.

2694
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:50,310
And then.

2695
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:52,870
The last thing I did.

2696
01:34:53,410 --> 01:34:54,790
Was the millionaire.

2697
01:34:55,150 --> 01:34:56,010
Which this.

2698
01:34:57,970 --> 01:34:59,190
Um again.

2699
01:34:59,530 --> 01:35:01,950
Each one was one take.

2700
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:03,310
I think I'm.

2701
01:35:03,430 --> 01:35:05,150
I kind of scare myself.

2702
01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:07,690
With how well I think I know myself.

2703
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:08,590
Because.

2704
01:35:09,490 --> 01:35:10,050
Essentially.

2705
01:35:10,290 --> 01:35:11,570
I had to say.

2706
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:13,390
I did the mint take first.

2707
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:14,210
Right.

2708
01:35:17,190 --> 01:35:18,950
I did the mint take first.

2709
01:35:19,530 --> 01:35:20,370
And then.

2710
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:22,110
I did the frogbert take.

2711
01:35:22,490 --> 01:35:23,810
And I had to remember.

2712
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:26,590
How long of a pause and stuff that I did.

2713
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:27,550
For each one.

2714
01:35:29,130 --> 01:35:29,690
And.

2715
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:32,270
I just kind of whiffed.

2716
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:32,670
For a minute.

2717
01:35:33,450 --> 01:35:34,690
Good evening everyone.

2718
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:36,950
And I also had no script here.

2719
01:35:37,610 --> 01:35:38,690
We are here.

2720
01:35:38,850 --> 01:35:40,870
With our contestant frogbert.

2721
01:35:41,090 --> 01:35:42,650
And they are on their final.

2722
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:45,330
Question of the night.

2723
01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:47,250
The questions that will determine.

2724
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:48,630
If they become.

2725
01:35:48,730 --> 01:35:50,550
It was really silly.

2726
01:35:52,270 --> 01:35:53,150
Because I'm just.

2727
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:55,450
Because especially for.

2728
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:56,390
For this.

2729
01:35:56,630 --> 01:35:57,270
Hold on.

2730
01:35:57,330 --> 01:35:58,850
Actually do I have like the video.

2731
01:35:58,850 --> 01:35:59,990
Um.

2732
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:01,970
Wait.

2733
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:04,510
Wait.

2734
01:36:04,770 --> 01:36:05,310
Oh.

2735
01:36:06,490 --> 01:36:07,350
Here we go.

2736
01:36:08,530 --> 01:36:09,410
Where's my recordings.

2737
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,140
I don't know if you can hear that.

2738
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,320
Like it would look like this.

2739
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,880
And I'm just awkwardly.

2740
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:25,340
By myself.

2741
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:28,760
Sitting in the chair.

2742
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:34,270
So.

2743
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:36,530
Um.

2744
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:37,050
Yeah.

2745
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:38,690
And uh.

2746
01:36:38,870 --> 01:36:39,590
That was fun.

2747
01:36:40,490 --> 01:36:41,290
One second.

2748
01:36:45,730 --> 01:36:46,170
And.

2749
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:48,570
Yeah.

2750
01:36:48,570 --> 01:36:49,010
Um.

2751
01:36:49,530 --> 01:36:51,170
I did that in one take.

2752
01:36:51,650 --> 01:36:53,970
I basically like I recorded the one part.

2753
01:36:54,190 --> 01:36:55,090
And then I was like.

2754
01:36:56,870 --> 01:36:57,890
I kind of had them.

2755
01:36:58,190 --> 01:36:59,690
I had to do frogberts.

2756
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:01,570
Like mimicking whatever I said here.

2757
01:37:01,650 --> 01:37:02,770
But there was one part I forgot.

2758
01:37:03,470 --> 01:37:04,490
It was um.

2759
01:37:04,590 --> 01:37:05,610
I forgot what I said.

2760
01:37:06,290 --> 01:37:06,910
As frogbert.

2761
01:37:07,150 --> 01:37:08,510
Or rather as mint.

2762
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:09,310
Me.

2763
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:10,210
Sorry.

2764
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:12,850
It's weird differentiating.

2765
01:37:13,090 --> 01:37:15,770
I know our audience is so excited.

2766
01:37:15,910 --> 01:37:17,230
I know you're so excited.

2767
01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:20,290
And I'm getting heart palpitations.

2768
01:37:20,470 --> 01:37:20,730
So.

2769
01:37:21,810 --> 01:37:22,790
Let us.

2770
01:37:23,670 --> 01:37:25,670
Let us do our final.

2771
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:27,450
Question of the night.

2772
01:37:27,670 --> 01:37:28,550
Are you ready?

2773
01:37:28,670 --> 01:37:31,990
I forgot that I asked.

2774
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:32,710
Are you ready?

2775
01:37:32,710 --> 01:37:33,790
And so.

2776
01:37:34,710 --> 01:37:35,750
This part.

2777
01:37:36,010 --> 01:37:38,310
The frogbert's response was.

2778
01:37:38,430 --> 01:37:40,310
I forgot to record a response.

2779
01:37:40,330 --> 01:37:40,750
Is that.

2780
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:43,170
Oh there's double audio?

2781
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:44,950
Wait.

2782
01:37:47,350 --> 01:37:48,790
Wait what do you mean double audio?

2783
01:37:52,030 --> 01:37:53,070
You can hear it twice?

2784
01:37:58,090 --> 01:37:58,650
Oh.

2785
01:38:02,150 --> 01:38:02,710
Here?

2786
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:03,090
Okay.

2787
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:04,030
Now it's fine right?

2788
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:06,270
Only for the videos you're playing.

2789
01:38:09,310 --> 01:38:10,010
Oh so.

2790
01:38:10,090 --> 01:38:11,510
Oh I'm so sorry you guys.

2791
01:38:11,570 --> 01:38:12,850
I thought that you guys couldn't.

2792
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:13,910
Okay I thought it was okay.

2793
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:14,850
Okay there we go.

2794
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:17,710
But yeah so that was actually supposed to be.

2795
01:38:18,530 --> 01:38:19,370
Frogbert's intro.

2796
01:38:20,690 --> 01:38:21,770
That's why he's waving.

2797
01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:24,110
Here is your.

2798
01:38:25,950 --> 01:38:26,430
Okay.

2799
01:38:32,050 --> 01:38:33,010
So that's.

2800
01:38:33,010 --> 01:38:35,130
That's why it's kind of weird.

2801
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:36,750
His intro.

2802
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:39,530
Hold on.

2803
01:38:39,610 --> 01:38:41,730
I have frogbert's whole take right here.

2804
01:38:44,170 --> 01:38:44,890
It's just.

2805
01:38:45,110 --> 01:38:46,010
Oh wait hold on.

2806
01:38:46,090 --> 01:38:46,690
I can't hear it.

2807
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:48,390
Give me a second.

2808
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:49,750
Give me a second.

2809
01:38:50,230 --> 01:38:51,690
It'll just be kind of like.

2810
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:53,570
I don't think I cut out anything.

2811
01:38:54,510 --> 01:38:54,990
Hi.

2812
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:05,110
So it was a lot of just.

2813
01:39:05,110 --> 01:39:05,710
Sitting.

2814
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:08,550
And being quiet.

2815
01:39:08,930 --> 01:39:10,510
And just pretending I'm.

2816
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:12,730
Responding.

2817
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:14,370
And stuff.

2818
01:39:14,950 --> 01:39:16,830
Oh narrator.

2819
01:39:17,190 --> 01:39:18,870
I'm feeling good.

2820
01:39:19,270 --> 01:39:20,650
I'm feeling like.

2821
01:39:20,730 --> 01:39:21,970
A million bucks.

2822
01:39:22,150 --> 01:39:24,070
Are about to go in my pocket.

2823
01:39:25,090 --> 01:39:26,150
I'm feeling.

2824
01:39:27,530 --> 01:39:28,910
And I had to pretend.

2825
01:39:28,990 --> 01:39:30,010
That I was getting interrupted.

2826
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:30,950
And everything.

2827
01:39:32,470 --> 01:39:33,690
And it all just kind of.

2828
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:35,190
The timing all just worked out.

2829
01:39:35,530 --> 01:39:36,570
I think I'm a genius.

2830
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:40,750
In my pocket.

2831
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:44,890
So I had a lot of fun.

2832
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:45,590
Making those.

2833
01:39:45,670 --> 01:39:47,330
They were a good time.

2834
01:39:50,170 --> 01:39:50,890
There we go.

2835
01:39:50,990 --> 01:39:52,110
The BGM is back.

2836
01:39:52,890 --> 01:39:53,490
So yeah.

2837
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:55,290
I was trying to think of like.

2838
01:39:55,390 --> 01:39:57,210
What other things I could do.

2839
01:39:58,590 --> 01:39:58,950
Initially.

2840
01:39:59,930 --> 01:40:00,650
I was.

2841
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:02,650
My first idea.

2842
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:04,890
For the stream.

2843
01:40:04,990 --> 01:40:05,630
Was going to be.

2844
01:40:07,410 --> 01:40:08,770
Was going to be family feud.

2845
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:10,090
With more people.

2846
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:11,170
But it was kind of hard.

2847
01:40:13,110 --> 01:40:14,270
It was kind of hard.

2848
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:16,050
Getting a bunch of people.

2849
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:18,910
And I knew I was only going to have it.

2850
01:40:18,950 --> 01:40:19,970
For like an hour or so.

2851
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:21,110
So it wasn't going to be super long.

2852
01:40:22,190 --> 01:40:23,550
But it was like gathering all the people.

2853
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:24,970
And at the end.

2854
01:40:25,550 --> 01:40:26,530
Everyone was going to leave.

2855
01:40:27,850 --> 01:40:29,210
And it was going to be a showdown.

2856
01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:30,350
Between me and Frogbert.

2857
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:32,830
But instead I did Wheel of Fortune.

2858
01:40:32,910 --> 01:40:33,450
Not Wheel of Fortune.

2859
01:40:33,630 --> 01:40:35,470
Who wants to be a millionaire?

2860
01:40:37,270 --> 01:40:39,510
And I made my own Wheel of Fortune.

2861
01:40:39,630 --> 01:40:40,390
Did you guys like my.

2862
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:41,970
Actually we didn't even finish.

2863
01:40:42,270 --> 01:40:43,170
The other ones.

2864
01:40:43,230 --> 01:40:45,310
I had two other.

2865
01:40:45,410 --> 01:40:46,510
Oh three others.

2866
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:49,590
I had three other categories.

2867
01:40:50,490 --> 01:40:53,130
One of them was another stream quote.

2868
01:40:53,670 --> 01:40:54,530
And that was.

2869
01:40:54,570 --> 01:40:55,650
Let's kill the hoe.

2870
01:40:57,210 --> 01:40:58,150
A classic.

2871
01:40:58,790 --> 01:40:59,550
And then.

2872
01:41:00,670 --> 01:41:01,690
The other one.

2873
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:03,670
The one after was a song title.

2874
01:41:04,110 --> 01:41:05,390
That was rules of nature.

2875
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:07,570
I had to sneak in another metal gear.

2876
01:41:07,610 --> 01:41:09,730
And then the last one.

2877
01:41:10,010 --> 01:41:12,490
I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to do this one or not.

2878
01:41:12,590 --> 01:41:15,010
It depended on how long each one would take.

2879
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:15,350
You know.

2880
01:41:17,150 --> 01:41:19,410
The last one was a person.

2881
01:41:19,690 --> 01:41:20,930
And it was Tam Tender.

2882
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:25,170
Which is kind of my brain rot.

2883
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:25,670
Right now.

2884
01:41:27,230 --> 01:41:28,470
It's Tam Tam der.

2885
01:41:34,010 --> 01:41:35,210
Tam Dan der.

2886
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:36,510
Tam Tender.

2887
01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:38,630
Tam Dan der.

2888
01:41:38,630 --> 01:41:39,250
Tam Tender.

2889
01:41:39,450 --> 01:41:39,890
Hahahahaha.

2890
01:41:42,050 --> 01:41:43,490
So those are the other three.

2891
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:44,290
That we didn't get to.

2892
01:41:44,370 --> 01:41:47,590
But I told Batara and Doki and Lime.

2893
01:41:47,690 --> 01:41:48,310
That it would be.

2894
01:41:48,750 --> 01:41:49,650
Just an hour.

2895
01:41:49,810 --> 01:41:51,290
So I didn't want to go too far over.

2896
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:55,090
And yeah.

2897
01:41:55,090 --> 01:41:55,090
Oh yeah.

2898
01:41:56,930 --> 01:42:07,190
I was going to have a different advertisement for my happy coat, but I also didn't get to do it.

2899
01:42:07,490 --> 01:42:08,810
It'd be hard to describe.

2900
01:42:10,170 --> 01:42:12,270
That's my name you're laughing about.

2901
01:42:14,290 --> 01:42:17,000
Oh gosh.

2902
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:19,140
I've watched it like 50 times.

2903
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:19,860
It's so funny.

2904
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:22,460
Damn, Jen!

2905
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:28,840
But yeah, so... That was everything I planned.

2906
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:33,200
All leading up to my announcement.

2907
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:34,920
Oh, I forgot!

2908
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:36,760
I forgot the last commercial, of course.

2909
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:40,480
Can you guys tell I do my own editing?

2910
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:42,540
Hold on.

2911
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:48,080
You guys... I don't know how I found this music.

2912
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:49,420
It is the most...

2913
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:57,740
I heard this music and I was like, oh no, I think I found the one.

2914
01:42:58,100 --> 01:43:01,680
It's the most PP music I've ever heard of in my entire life.

2915
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:04,460
It's so good.

2916
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:05,800
Hold on.

2917
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:08,260
There we go.

2918
01:43:08,780 --> 01:43:09,280
There we go.

2919
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:15,470
This also, I didn't have a script and I just...

2920
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:21,060
I just did it all in one take.

2921
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:23,660
And I'm...

2922
01:43:27,950 --> 01:43:28,830
I'm like...

2923
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:32,110
And when I was editing it, I was like, I don't have time.

2924
01:43:32,310 --> 01:43:35,420
I gotta go today!

2925
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,380
And so I just did it in one take.

2926
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:38,600
And I was just...

2927
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:40,880
And at the end, I'm just like, join us today!

2928
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:42,920
And I was like, wait, it's not today!

2929
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:45,960
I'm so dumb!

2930
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,200
Do you like ghosts?

2931
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:49,820
Do you like maids?

2932
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:51,820
Do you like ghost maids?

2933
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:53,720
Do you like mint phantom?

2934
01:43:55,740 --> 01:44:01,240
Yeah, I crossed out the Danny phantom or the Danny part.

2935
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:05,260
This one...

2936
01:44:06,460 --> 01:44:12,080
Actually, there's like one thing about my new model that is cut out in this.

2937
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,180
You can see it here.

2938
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:16,540
But it's cut out in this version.

2939
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:19,920
I don't know, maybe if you're...

2940
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:22,560
If you can see, you can see maybe.

2941
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:25,380
Yeah, you guys see!

2942
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:26,180
The Ahoge!

2943
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:30,580
Yeah, it's the same but a little different.

2944
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:38,320
It's bringing back the Ahoge because I had Ahoge in my first ever spiritual form.

2945
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,140
So I brought back the Ahoge, baby.

2946
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:43,000
Yeah.

2947
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:45,940
Sharp eyes can find it.

2948
01:44:46,660 --> 01:44:47,820
That's right, folks.

2949
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:50,920
Introducing mint phantom 3.0.

2950
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:52,540
A whole new...

2951
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:53,100
Model.

2952
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,920
We have a lore video.

2953
01:44:56,140 --> 01:44:58,120
We have a stream.

2954
01:44:58,240 --> 01:44:59,440
Why did I say that?

2955
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:00,940
I couldn't...

2956
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:04,120
I was like...

2957
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:05,000
Oh, what will I have?

2958
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:06,120
Okay, so I was like...

2959
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:07,540
In my mind, I was like...

2960
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:09,040
What will I have for my re-debut?

2961
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:13,880
I'll have a lore video and I'll have...

2962
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:17,120
I couldn't...

2963
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:19,960
I couldn't think of anything else.

2964
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:23,340
This is...

2965
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:25,980
I literally...

2966
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:26,880
I was like...

2967
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:27,320
Oh, God.

2968
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:31,600
Nobody's gonna get excited for this because it's so awful.

2969
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:36,040
I can't even advertise my own stuff.

2970
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:43,240
And again, I feel weird like making it such a big deal because it is not like a new outfit or anything.

2971
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:44,340
It's just...

2972
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:45,740
It's just me...

2973
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:47,680
Shinier, maybe.

2974
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:51,240
We have other surprises for you to gander at.

2975
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:52,380
That's right.

2976
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:54,720
Mint Phantom 3.0.

2977
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:56,140
Brand new model.

2978
01:45:56,620 --> 01:45:59,040
And when will this be revealed, you ask?

2979
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:01,780
Well, it will be revealed this fall.

2980
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:03,400
Hallow's Eve.

2981
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:04,900
That's right.

2982
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:06,580
Halloween night.

2983
01:46:07,460 --> 01:46:08,220
October...

2984
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:12,460
That was me forgetting what day Halloween is.

2985
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:16,220
That was me...

2986
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:19,560
Forgetting what...

2987
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:20,840
31st.

2988
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:21,220
What day is Halloween?

2989
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:23,020
You heard it here first, folks.

2990
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:27,100
October 31st is Mint Phantom 3.0.

2991
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:28,100
New model.

2992
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:29,200
New rigging.

2993
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:30,380
Whole new look.

2994
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:31,760
Except not really.

2995
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:34,520
Come and join in on the fun today.

2996
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:36,700
And see you then.

2997
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:40,260
October 31st, 7pm EST.

2998
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:45,760
Actually, I'm just gonna change this music to be today's background music instead.

2999
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:47,500
Where is it?

3000
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:49,920
Uh...

3001
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:51,220
Oh...

3002
01:46:51,940 --> 01:46:53,600
Where did I save it to?

3003
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:54,820
Uhh.

3004
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:57,660
Oh, here it is.

3005
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:20,360
It's so off!

3006
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:35,160
But I will have other stuff at my debut.

3007
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:37,040
Please come.

3008
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:44,360
Like everything will be really new and shiny.

3009
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:50,980
I'll have lots of new music and new other stuff too.

3010
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,720
Hopefully, as long as it's done in time.

3011
01:47:52,780 --> 01:47:53,620
Nothing is finished.

3012
01:47:57,740 --> 01:47:59,440
Please, please come.

3013
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:10,240
Why are there birds in this song?

3014
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:13,300
I heard this and I was like, this has got to be the one.

3015
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:18,300
Hold on, I want this guy on my screen too.

3016
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:24,120
Look at him go!

3017
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:32,860
I don't even know who these guys are.

3018
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:33,640
I just found them.

3019
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:41,900
Yesterday.

3020
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:47,320
Okay, you guys are good sports.

3021
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:49,280
I will give you a preview.

3022
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:50,700
It's a short stream today.

3023
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:54,220
I'm dealing with the jet hag.

3024
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:56,940
I'm on the final boss.

3025
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:00,160
Wait, where is my old music actually?

3026
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:00,620
Oh no!

3027
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:01,020
Wait!

3028
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:01,620
Oh no!

3029
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:02,660
Oh no!

3030
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:04,000
I lost it.

3031
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:04,540
Wait a second.

3032
01:49:04,660 --> 01:49:05,160
No, I didn't.

3033
01:49:06,380 --> 01:49:07,280
Was it this one?

3034
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:08,860
Yeah.

3035
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:11,800
Okay.

3036
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:13,780
You guys want a preview?

3037
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:17,460
I got permission for this preview.

3038
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:22,580
So I can show you guys if you want a little sneak peek.

3039
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:28,200
Don't worry, it won't be...

3040
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:30,740
It won't be...

3041
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:33,040
It won't be anything to give you away.

3042
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:34,280
If you like surprises.

3043
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:34,920
So...

3044
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:37,820
In fact, watch this.

3045
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:38,520
I'm gonna...

3046
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:40,680
Actually, I don't know how cursed it will look.

3047
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:42,920
As Chibi Minto.

3048
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:44,500
But let's see.

3049
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:49,040
Do you guys have to see?

3050
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:51,880
Like this.

3051
01:49:52,380 --> 01:49:54,420
Okay, give me a second because I'm gonna go set up.

3052
01:49:54,620 --> 01:49:55,780
I gotta set up some stuff.

3053
01:49:58,620 --> 01:49:59,100
It's...

3054
01:49:59,100 --> 01:49:59,440
Um...

3055
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:01,900
Give me a second.

3056
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:02,880
Give me a second.

3057
01:50:04,700 --> 01:50:05,500
Blurry, blurry.

3058
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:08,800
I really appreciate it.

3059
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:11,740
I'm sorry if we couldn't celebrate on the day of.

3060
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:17,400
I hope you guys are still excited.

3061
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:20,580
Nonetheless, I'm very excited.

3062
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:22,220
Thank you guys for all the...

3063
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:22,400
Oh!

3064
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:25,420
I wanted to also go over some stuff from Twitter.

3065
01:50:26,540 --> 01:50:28,540
I've been looking at things.

3066
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:29,720
On Twitter.

3067
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:31,180
So...

3068
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:31,900
Um...

3069
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:32,780
We can do that.

3070
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,420
I'll go through it just a little bit.

3071
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:36,380
Some stuff too.

3072
01:50:39,460 --> 01:50:40,640
Hold on, real quick.

3073
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:46,000
Okay.

3074
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:48,060
It's gonna look really cursed.

3075
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:48,520
Okay?

3076
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:51,420
It's gonna look really ghastly even.

3077
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:53,560
You might say.

3078
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:55,660
Looks pretty cursed.

3079
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:56,460
Probably.

3080
01:50:58,740 --> 01:50:59,340
Wow!

3081
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:29,440
It's actually cute though.

3082
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:30,140
I promise.

3083
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:32,600
It will be much cuter.

3084
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:34,000
The day of.

3085
01:51:35,260 --> 01:51:35,740
So...

3086
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:36,920
So here it comes!

3087
01:51:41,220 --> 01:51:41,700
Yeah!

3088
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:45,340
Come to my re-debut!

3089
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:47,640
October 31st.

3090
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:49,020
October 31st.

3091
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:55,780
Yeah I know the more I zoom in, the more clear it becomes.

3092
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:57,220
It's not finished though.

3093
01:51:57,220 --> 01:52:00,420
So, you can even maybe see some parts here that aren't finished.

3094
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:07,200
Okie-dokie.

3095
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:08,900
I go back to Chibi-B too.

3096
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:18,280
All seeing!

3097
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:25,600
I am all seeing!

3098
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:32,340
Okie-dokie.

3099
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:34,040
I am all seeing!

3100
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:42,260
Okie-dokie.

3101
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:49,080
One second.

3102
01:52:55,950 --> 01:52:56,790
One second.

3103
01:52:59,150 --> 01:53:00,310
Thank you!

3104
01:53:01,290 --> 01:53:02,090
Thank

3105
01:53:06,050 --> 01:53:06,410
you!

3106
01:53:07,210 --> 01:53:08,550
Thank you!

3107
01:53:08,550 --> 01:53:10,590
For Super Chats, thank you!

3108
01:53:11,490 --> 01:53:12,650
Thank you!

3109
01:53:14,310 --> 01:53:14,770
Thank you!

3110
01:53:17,070 --> 01:53:17,710
Thank you!

3111
01:53:18,450 --> 01:53:19,810
Thank you so much!

3112
01:53:22,830 --> 01:53:23,430
Twitter!

3113
01:53:26,070 --> 01:53:31,870
Twitter.com There are some crazy things on here that I saw.

3114
01:53:32,050 --> 01:53:32,570
I was like, woah!

3115
01:53:33,830 --> 01:53:35,370
You guys were kind of...

3116
01:53:35,370 --> 01:53:37,090
I also stole the hashtag.

3117
01:53:37,210 --> 01:53:38,750
Sorry I didn't have one beforehand.

3118
01:53:41,590 --> 01:53:43,850
Sorry I didn't have one beforehand.

3119
01:53:44,590 --> 01:53:46,290
I'm a little silly.

3120
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:58,020
Wait, where's the hashtag?

3121
01:53:58,400 --> 01:53:59,460
Where's my... there.

3122
01:54:00,260 --> 01:54:00,820
Ok.

3123
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:07,020
I'm going to share some things.

3124
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:08,420
Real quick.

3125
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:10,900
One second.

3126
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:13,080
One second.

3127
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:15,340
Just a few things.

3128
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:18,220
Like I said, today's stream isn't going to be very long.

3129
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:20,760
I'm quite tired.

3130
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,480
But also, I just wanted to have like a fun time.

3131
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:29,040
And just have like a short fun time with you guys.

3132
01:54:29,140 --> 01:54:31,820
Not make it a super big deal or anything.

3133
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:32,520
You know?

3134
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:37,120
I do appreciate everybody being here though.

3135
01:54:37,980 --> 01:54:39,400
It's not my first birthday.

3136
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:42,640
But it won't be my last.

3137
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:44,460
We can celebrate next year too.

3138
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:47,860
3.0 model defogger.

3139
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:50,580
Okie dokie.

3140
01:54:50,700 --> 01:54:51,420
First thing...

3141
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:51,720
Oh my gosh.

3142
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:52,280
I saw this.

3143
01:54:52,780 --> 01:54:53,480
I saw this.

3144
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:54,920
I have to go through and comment on everything.

3145
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:58,620
So, I was looking at stuff I haven't commented or liked or anything yet.

3146
01:54:58,720 --> 01:54:59,540
Because I was like, oh gosh.

3147
01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:00,860
I got to go through everything.

3148
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:02,480
But...

3149
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,020
Ah!

3150
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:04,020
Oh sorry.

3151
01:55:04,180 --> 01:55:04,900
Oh my gosh.

3152
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:06,660
The transition scared the heck out of me.

3153
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:07,660
Oh my god.

3154
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:08,700
First...

3155
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:09,860
TaoTan!

3156
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:13,700
TaoTan is so cute.

3157
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:14,440
Thank you for watching.

3158
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:15,980
I never thought I would see...

3159
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:19,420
I never thought I would see TaoTan cosplay me.

3160
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:20,720
I was so excited.

3161
01:55:20,860 --> 01:55:21,380
I was like...

3162
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:24,380
So cute.

3163
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:26,120
Thank you.

3164
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:29,500
So cute.

3165
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:31,160
So, so, so cute.

3166
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:36,760
So cute.

3167
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:37,240
I was...

3168
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:37,820
I was like...

3169
01:55:37,820 --> 01:55:40,220
I was seriously fangirling this morning.

3170
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:41,180
I was like...

3171
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:45,600
3.0.

3172
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:45,760
Yeah.

3173
01:55:45,820 --> 01:55:46,460
That's my 3.0.

3174
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:46,560
3D.

3175
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:47,320
No.

3176
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:48,900
I wish my 3D looked this cute.

3177
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:51,680
She's so cute.

3178
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:55,820
I was so excited.

3179
01:55:55,860 --> 01:55:56,260
I was like...

3180
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:56,420
Oh!

3181
01:55:56,440 --> 01:55:57,380
I was just so excited.

3182
01:55:58,820 --> 01:55:59,420
So yeah.

3183
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:00,400
Thank you TaoTan.

3184
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,040
So cute.

3185
01:56:04,140 --> 01:56:04,580
So cute.

3186
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:05,920
Oh wait.

3187
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:07,140
How am I supposed to...

3188
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:07,240
Oh.

3189
01:56:08,180 --> 01:56:08,660
Um.

3190
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:10,320
Ah.

3191
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:10,920
Wait.

3192
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:11,460
Oh.

3193
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:11,780
I...

3194
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:12,080
I...

3195
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:13,300
Didn't consider...

3196
01:56:13,300 --> 01:56:13,620
Hold on.

3197
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:14,800
Ah.

3198
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:17,400
Oh.

3199
01:56:17,540 --> 01:56:18,500
I have to adjust.

3200
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:18,780
Oh.

3201
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:19,080
It's all done.

3202
01:56:19,420 --> 01:56:20,220
I'm stupid.

3203
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:20,740
I'm sorry.

3204
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:22,740
I'm sorry.

3205
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:23,160
I...

3206
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:24,460
Did this all wrong.

3207
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:25,200
Okay.

3208
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:25,580
There we go.

3209
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:28,140
Another thing.

3210
01:56:28,220 --> 01:56:28,820
Another thing.

3211
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:29,400
Another thing.

3212
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:30,120
Ta-da!

3213
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:33,240
Made!

3214
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:33,400
Oh!

3215
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:36,740
I'm not the maid.

3216
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:37,320
I'm Ojousama.

3217
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:37,500
No.

3218
01:56:37,540 --> 01:56:38,180
I'm always maid.

3219
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:39,820
I'm always maid.

3220
01:56:39,860 --> 01:56:40,580
I'm always maid.

3221
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:42,820
Thank you for the beautiful art!

3222
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:45,640
Why is that wisp in the front so dapper?

3223
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:47,860
And snake.

3224
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:49,860
Everybody's here.

3225
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,140
So cute.

3226
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,760
Even snake gets a crown.

3227
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:58,180
Are you just kidding?

3228
01:56:58,560 --> 01:56:59,540
It's so cute.

3229
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:00,760
Thank you.

3230
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:03,640
There's so much crazy stuff in here.

3231
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:04,840
Like...

3232
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:05,000
Oh!

3233
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:06,040
Wait.

3234
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:06,900
I just saw this.

3235
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:07,760
Wait.

3236
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:09,080
Why?

3237
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:13,580
I didn't get to see it.

3238
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:29,720
Sorry, Huening.

3239
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:30,500
I'm using your video.

3240
01:57:44,420 --> 01:57:46,560
Oh, there's so much art!

3241
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:51,160
There's so much art!

3242
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:52,220
Thank you!

3243
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:54,660
Oh, Kami!

3244
01:57:57,100 --> 01:57:58,760
Oh, it all looks so amazing!

3245
01:58:00,290 --> 01:58:01,380
Oh my god.

3246
01:58:01,420 --> 01:58:02,240
Thank you.

3247
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:04,380
Wow!

3248
01:58:07,420 --> 01:58:08,200
Yuki.

3249
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:10,800
Thank you, guys.

3250
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:13,640
Oh, thanks Ashes for putting this together.

3251
01:58:22,700 --> 01:58:23,660
I'm going to cry.

3252
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:24,720
I'm going to cry.

3253
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:26,020
Let's see.

3254
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:27,680
There is some more stuff.

3255
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:29,260
Oh, this!

3256
01:58:29,480 --> 01:58:30,520
I wanted to watch this!

3257
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:31,540
I didn't watch it yet.

3258
01:58:31,580 --> 01:58:32,500
I didn't watch it yet.

3259
01:58:33,140 --> 01:58:34,340
I didn't watch it yet.

3260
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:34,720
Hold on.

3261
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:37,260
I think it's fine.

3262
01:58:38,260 --> 01:58:39,920
Oh, let me scroll down a little.

3263
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:43,680
This, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this.

3264
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
I want to watch.

3265
01:58:48,140 --> 01:58:48,660
Ah!

3266
01:58:49,820 --> 01:58:50,900
So nostalgic.

3267
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:52,880
Done.

3268
01:58:53,320 --> 01:58:55,260
Happy birthday, Minto.

3269
01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:56,820
It's Jeffrey.

3270
01:58:57,060 --> 01:58:57,560
Jeffrey!

3271
01:58:58,100 --> 01:59:00,860
You'll use digital and they're residential taboo.

3272
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:04,840
For those of you who don't know, I worked on Outer Wilds.

3273
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:09,840
But if you actually noticed my work, that means I screwed up or you're a murderer.

3274
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:10,240
Like me.

3275
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:15,160
It was really fun joining your chat and watching your Echo stream.

3276
01:59:15,380 --> 01:59:19,380
Thank you so much again for playing our game and I'm glad you enjoyed it.

3277
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:24,960
I hope you have another wonderful year on this new fresh journey of yours.

3278
01:59:25,380 --> 01:59:30,680
And speaking of smelling plants, don't forget to smell the pine trees along the way.

3279
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:34,860
I have to go back to the Coding Mine, so I'll leave you here.

3280
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:39,640
Until next time, Minto.

3281
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:41,640
El.

3282
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:42,660
Sai.

3283
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:44,060
Kongroo.

3284
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:48,340
Oh my god, I thought that's just what he wore normally.

3285
01:59:58,980 --> 01:59:59,540
Sick.

3286
02:00:00,140 --> 02:00:01,840
That was like sick coat.

3287
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:03,820
Oh my

3288
02:00:07,590 --> 02:00:07,890
god.

3289
02:00:09,790 --> 02:00:11,590
Yeah, that's just how he dresses normally.

3290
02:00:14,170 --> 02:00:14,730
El.

3291
02:00:14,810 --> 02:00:15,210
Sai.

3292
02:00:15,470 --> 02:00:16,030
Kongroo.

3293
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:17,570
Oh my gosh, thank you.

3294
02:00:17,650 --> 02:00:18,690
Thank you, Jeffrey.

3295
02:00:19,450 --> 02:00:20,270
Thank you.

3296
02:00:20,870 --> 02:00:21,650
Thanks, Nano.

3297
02:00:23,850 --> 02:00:25,630
Oh my gosh, I'm Mintina now.

3298
02:00:27,110 --> 02:00:28,150
That's so awesome.

3299
02:00:28,410 --> 02:00:30,030
Oh my gosh, I'm crying from laughing.

3300
02:00:35,510 --> 02:00:37,030
These are so great.

3301
02:00:37,690 --> 02:00:39,190
This is so awesome too.

3302
02:00:39,550 --> 02:00:40,130
Hold on.

3303
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:44,970
Oh, it's a little cut off.

3304
02:00:45,030 --> 02:00:45,250
Hold on.

3305
02:00:46,290 --> 02:00:47,130
That should be good.

3306
02:00:47,410 --> 02:00:48,430
Wait, a little more down.

3307
02:00:48,550 --> 02:00:50,130
Sorry, I might have to cut off a little bit.

3308
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:50,430
Oh no.

3309
02:00:51,070 --> 02:00:51,390
No.

3310
02:00:53,950 --> 02:00:54,750
Does this have audio?

3311
02:00:55,370 --> 02:00:55,870
Oh, it does.

3312
02:00:56,590 --> 02:00:56,910
Ah!

3313
02:00:58,290 --> 02:00:58,610
Mom!

3314
02:00:59,990 --> 02:01:00,970
I'm in Pumark!

3315
02:01:02,770 --> 02:01:03,090
Here,

3316
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:09,360
let's show the artist's name.

3317
02:01:09,740 --> 02:01:10,780
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

3318
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:12,040
There you go.

3319
02:01:12,980 --> 02:01:14,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, you can see.

3320
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:14,640
Ah!

3321
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:17,320
Hold on, I can uncrop it a little bit.

3322
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:18,720
Ah!

3323
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:18,820
Ah!

3324
02:01:19,340 --> 02:01:20,700
My blue archive.

3325
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:21,460
It's so...

3326
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:23,480
Oh my gosh, the different expressions and everything.

3327
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:30,240
Oh my gosh.

3328
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:30,600
Ah!

3329
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:32,820
Oh my goodness.

3330
02:01:33,140 --> 02:01:33,980
I look so shy.

3331
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:35,840
The art's so good.

3332
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:36,960
Thank you!

3333
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,680
You have so many jammies.

3334
02:01:44,100 --> 02:01:45,260
I'm gonna watch the beginning.

3335
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:45,580
Ah!

3336
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:48,820
Oh, sorry.

3337
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:49,760
I should move the frog.

3338
02:01:50,820 --> 02:01:51,560
Hold on.

3339
02:01:54,100 --> 02:01:54,620
Sorry.

3340
02:01:54,620 --> 02:01:55,740
I forgot he was there.

3341
02:01:57,460 --> 02:01:58,940
Mint and blue archive win.

3342
02:01:59,160 --> 02:02:00,120
One day, I hope.

3343
02:02:01,620 --> 02:02:02,540
I'll do my best.

3344
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:08,160
Thank you, thank you!

3345
02:02:10,580 --> 02:02:11,560
It's so pretty.

3346
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:13,860
Wow!

3347
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:17,040
Let's see what else we got here.

3348
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:18,980
There's some other really crazy stuff in here.

3349
02:02:19,220 --> 02:02:19,680
I was like, wow.

3350
02:02:19,940 --> 02:02:21,240
You guys are so awesome.

3351
02:02:21,340 --> 02:02:22,540
There's all the art and everything.

3352
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:23,700
I wish I could feature everybody.

3353
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:26,480
Oh, there's another Times Square video.

3354
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:26,740
Oh, there's another time.

3355
02:02:29,220 --> 02:02:30,740
Oh, there's a video.

3356
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:30,840
Ah!

3357
02:02:31,060 --> 02:02:34,650
Oh my gosh!

3358
02:02:35,610 --> 02:02:37,050
Birthday cake for me!

3359
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:38,630
I have 19!

3360
02:02:38,750 --> 02:02:38,970
Yeah!

3361
02:02:40,470 --> 02:02:41,590
Asha, thank you!

3362
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:42,970
Did you make that?

3363
02:02:43,050 --> 02:02:44,110
It looks so delicious.

3364
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:48,250
I think I'll be spending all my pro...

3365
02:02:48,250 --> 02:02:49,630
I don't know how to say the prox...

3366
02:02:50,410 --> 02:02:52,010
...word, so I just got jammies.

3367
02:02:53,270 --> 02:02:54,390
It looks so yummy.

3368
02:02:54,510 --> 02:02:55,250
I haven't got...

3369
02:02:55,250 --> 02:02:57,330
Actually, after this stream, I was gonna go get cake.

3370
02:02:57,430 --> 02:02:57,870
So...

3371
02:02:57,870 --> 02:02:58,190
It's so good.

3372
02:02:58,690 --> 02:02:58,830
I am so happy.

3373
02:02:58,830 --> 02:02:58,870
I'm so happy.

3374
02:02:58,870 --> 02:02:59,690
Yeah.

3375
02:03:00,190 --> 02:03:01,690
It looks so good.

3376
02:03:01,790 --> 02:03:02,590
It's so drippy.

3377
02:03:02,670 --> 02:03:03,190
Just like me!

3378
02:03:05,610 --> 02:03:06,850
Thank you!

3379
02:03:07,050 --> 02:03:08,330
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3380
02:03:10,590 --> 02:03:12,130
It looks good.

3381
02:03:14,410 --> 02:03:15,030
Jeffrey!

3382
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:19,310
I mean, I could wear that normally.

3383
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:26,420
Thank you so much for the video!

3384
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:28,280
It was awesome.

3385
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:32,280
I'm so happy.

3386
02:03:33,820 --> 02:03:34,820
And this!

3387
02:03:36,120 --> 02:03:36,900
Wait, will it show?

3388
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:37,720
The whole thing?

3389
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:39,120
Rururu!

3390
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:45,280
At my birthday billboard in Akihabara!

3391
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:48,440
You look so awesome!

3392
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:53,560
Thank you!

3393
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:55,040
Here, I'll show the name.

3394
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,540
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3395
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,040
So cute!

3396
02:03:59,820 --> 02:04:01,960
Yeah, I actually got to see it.

3397
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:04,080
It was so surreal.

3398
02:04:04,420 --> 02:04:06,230
Seeing me on...

3399
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:10,380
On the radio kaikan billboard.

3400
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:11,460
And seeing me...

3401
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:14,220
On the Onoden billboard.

3402
02:04:14,260 --> 02:04:16,280
I was so...

3403
02:04:16,280 --> 02:04:17,780
Yeah, this radio kaikan.

3404
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:21,040
This is where Steins Gate even takes place!

3405
02:04:21,340 --> 02:04:22,620
Like, oh my god!

3406
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:23,880
Wow.

3407
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:25,100
I...

3408
02:04:25,100 --> 02:04:25,180
I...

3409
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:29,180
I was so...

3410
02:04:29,680 --> 02:04:30,980
I was so moved.

3411
02:04:44,300 --> 02:04:45,840
Thank you!

3412
02:04:47,340 --> 02:04:48,220
So

3413
02:04:54,010 --> 02:04:54,470
happy!

3414
02:04:58,190 --> 02:05:01,010
I think I'm just really happy that...

3415
02:05:02,930 --> 02:05:03,810
That...

3416
02:05:04,690 --> 02:05:05,530
That...

3417
02:05:05,530 --> 02:05:07,450
We could spend...

3418
02:05:07,450 --> 02:05:08,930
Another birthday together.

3419
02:05:09,010 --> 02:05:09,450
You know?

3420
02:05:10,890 --> 02:05:12,330
What is this Jerma video?

3421
02:05:12,490 --> 02:05:12,990
I'm scared.

3422
02:05:13,090 --> 02:05:13,990
I don't know this guy.

3423
02:05:15,850 --> 02:05:16,810
I'm scared to watch...

3424
02:05:16,810 --> 02:05:17,710
I'll watch that off stream.

3425
02:05:20,370 --> 02:05:21,170
There's something...

3426
02:05:21,170 --> 02:05:21,670
Oh, this!

3427
02:05:22,710 --> 02:05:23,650
Oh my gosh.

3428
02:05:24,330 --> 02:05:24,730
I...

3429
02:05:24,730 --> 02:05:26,110
This is so...

3430
02:05:27,070 --> 02:05:27,470
Tom!

3431
02:05:30,270 --> 02:05:31,810
You are so crazy!

3432
02:05:32,150 --> 02:05:33,790
This is so...

3433
02:05:33,790 --> 02:05:34,850
Oh my gosh, hold on.

3434
02:05:35,230 --> 02:05:36,910
Wait, I have to move it up a little bit.

3435
02:05:37,910 --> 02:05:38,730
AHHHHHH!

3436
02:05:41,710 --> 02:05:42,250
AHHHH!

3437
02:05:42,930 --> 02:05:45,920
It is!

3438
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:55,960
Seriously my arms are even like that!

3439
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:57,920
I'm doing....

3440
02:06:01,340 --> 02:06:03,300
It's so awesome!

3441
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:07,560
And Ham thank you for all your character...

3442
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:08,980
modeling and everything!

3443
02:06:11,420 --> 02:06:13,060
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

3444
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:17,840
Oh my gosh, I'm gonna put this on my computer right after this.

3445
02:06:18,100 --> 02:06:20,580
I'm gonna have the Minto virus... Minto virus real!

3446
02:06:21,020 --> 02:06:22,280
Wait, watch it again, watch it again.

3447
02:06:37,820 --> 02:06:38,740
And even...

3448
02:06:40,300 --> 02:06:42,940
Sorry, the dono is in the way.

3449
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:51,960
It's the theme of Tara.

3450
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:55,160
The theme of Matara.

3451
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:57,520
It's so awesome.

3452
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:16,620
Well, before Matara even debuted, I messaged her and I was like...

3453
02:07:17,290 --> 02:07:19,260
Yo, theme of Matara.

3454
02:07:19,580 --> 02:07:23,700
I was like, you have to use this song in your debut.

3455
02:07:24,040 --> 02:07:25,120
I don't think she ever did.

3456
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,860
I was like, theme of Matara.

3457
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:35,900
Oh yeah, yeah, here, here, here.

3458
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:37,440
You can see...

3459
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:41,520
The model.

3460
02:07:41,700 --> 02:07:42,380
Thank you, have!

3461
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:44,840
It looks so awesome!

3462
02:07:44,900 --> 02:07:45,440
Wait!

3463
02:07:45,660 --> 02:07:47,940
Can this go into that mod, I wonder?

3464
02:07:50,100 --> 02:07:51,760
Can this go into that mod?

3465
02:07:52,280 --> 02:07:53,760
For putting...

3466
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:56,560
Putting Minto in Metal Gear Solid.

3467
02:07:58,520 --> 02:07:59,340
I wonder.

3468
02:08:01,180 --> 02:08:03,220
Tom, thank you so much!

3469
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:03,980
It's so awesome!

3470
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:05,440
I saw this too!

3471
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:07,640
This is so cute.

3472
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:08,820
Wait, hold on.

3473
02:08:08,820 --> 02:08:10,400
I'm gonna let it redo...

3474
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:12,260
I think now.

3475
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:12,860
There we go.

3476
02:08:12,980 --> 02:08:13,000
Oh!

3477
02:08:13,260 --> 02:08:14,340
A snake?

3478
02:08:14,360 --> 02:08:15,860
Can it go inside the love box?

3479
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:18,140
And I possess the love...

3480
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:22,060
It's so cute!

3481
02:08:22,620 --> 02:08:24,080
Thank you for commissioning this.

3482
02:08:24,160 --> 02:08:25,060
It's so, so cute.

3483
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:27,300
I saw this earlier too.

3484
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:32,800
That is a Metal Gear reference.

3485
02:08:34,100 --> 02:08:34,620
Yes.

3486
02:08:36,780 --> 02:08:40,820
Every time I get Metal Gear art, I just lose my mind.

3487
02:08:40,940 --> 02:08:41,920
It's so awesome.

3488
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:44,400
There's so much beautiful art.

3489
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:48,320
So cute!

3490
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:51,860
Oh my gosh!

3491
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:52,400
Wait!

3492
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:55,420
Wow, friend!

3493
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:56,480
You're so cute!

3494
02:08:57,360 --> 02:09:01,040
Thank you for going to see the billboard in Akiba!

3495
02:09:01,680 --> 02:09:02,520
Oh my gosh!

3496
02:09:02,540 --> 02:09:03,560
I know it's kind of difficult.

3497
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:04,440
You know, not every...

3498
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:07,800
If you're not visiting Japan, or if you don't live in Japan, you know...

3499
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:11,980
You know, my stream times are hard for Japanese viewers anyway, so...

3500
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:15,340
My team was out of this world.

3501
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:17,240
Big Ham posted the full model render in the tag.

3502
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:17,480
Yeah!

3503
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:18,400
I saw it!

3504
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:18,880
Thank you!

3505
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:20,100
Oh my gosh!

3506
02:09:20,120 --> 02:09:21,380
Thank you so much!

3507
02:09:22,780 --> 02:09:23,700
Thank you!

3508
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:25,280
Oh my gosh!

3509
02:09:25,980 --> 02:09:26,900
You guys went...

3510
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:28,620
Everything is so crazy!

3511
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:29,820
And then this!

3512
02:09:30,980 --> 02:09:31,460
Cool!

3513
02:09:32,180 --> 02:09:33,140
Oh my gosh!

3514
02:09:33,140 --> 02:09:33,540
Oh my gosh!

3515
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:38,220
I made a free resin 3D printable model for making Wisp keychains!

3516
02:09:38,220 --> 02:09:42,680
So if you guys want a Wisp keychain, you can 3D print your own!

3517
02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:46,580
And Cole made a little printable.

3518
02:09:46,700 --> 02:09:47,600
It's so cute!

3519
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:51,420
I can't!

3520
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:52,540
Everything...

3521
02:09:58,180 --> 02:09:59,900
Everything is so awesome!

3522
02:10:01,890 --> 02:10:02,820
Thank you guys!

3523
02:10:05,700 --> 02:10:07,300
Oh, I want to squish them!

3524
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:11,400
I don't think you can squish the 3D printables.

3525
02:10:13,980 --> 02:10:14,960
Oh my gosh!

3526
02:10:18,140 --> 02:10:19,440
Oh, I want to show off everything.

3527
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:21,020
I don't really have time.

3528
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:22,200
There's a Kudo board!

3529
02:10:22,460 --> 02:10:22,940
Oh my gosh!

3530
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:23,500
Thank you!

3531
02:10:23,560 --> 02:10:24,120
Oh, look at that!

3532
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:25,660
Thank you, Fawn!

3533
02:10:25,720 --> 02:10:27,060
I will look at the Kudo board.

3534
02:10:27,900 --> 02:10:29,040
The Kudo board.

3535
02:10:30,140 --> 02:10:30,580
Takisoyo!

3536
02:10:30,660 --> 02:10:30,820
Oh!

3537
02:10:34,540 --> 02:10:35,780
Thank you guys!

3538
02:10:35,940 --> 02:10:36,880
Thank you!

3539
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:37,400
Thank you!

3540
02:10:37,420 --> 02:10:37,800
Thank you!

3541
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:38,420
Thank you!

3542
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:43,600
Thank you!

3543
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:46,540
I will look at this after stream.

3544
02:10:47,620 --> 02:10:48,320
Yeah, yeah.

3545
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:50,880
There's just so much beautiful art.

3546
02:10:51,240 --> 02:10:52,940
Thank you guys for adopting the hashtag.

3547
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:54,920
I will go through, of course, the...

3548
02:10:57,040 --> 02:10:59,480
My regular tag for things that weren't...

3549
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:00,800
Because, of course, I didn't put the hashtag.

3550
02:11:00,820 --> 02:11:01,380
I put out a hashtag.

3551
02:11:02,380 --> 02:11:03,400
And so...

3552
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:06,660
If you didn't use it, don't worry.

3553
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:07,680
I'll still see your stuff.

3554
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:08,880
I will still...

3555
02:11:09,620 --> 02:11:12,160
I will still retweet and everything, of course.

3556
02:11:13,500 --> 02:11:14,020
So...

3557
02:11:16,140 --> 02:11:16,660
Yeah.

3558
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:22,400
I'm so happy.

3559
02:11:23,160 --> 02:11:25,640
Thank you guys for an amazing death day.

3560
02:11:25,640 --> 02:11:26,100
Yeah.

3561
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:28,760
Oh my God.

3562
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:29,620
This is so funny.

3563
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:34,300
How did you...

3564
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:40,460
Not the miss worldwide...

3565
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:42,360
Mr. Worldwide collab.

3566
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:45,120
Thank you, for the...

3567
02:11:45,120 --> 02:11:46,020
Thank you, Johnny!

3568
02:11:46,360 --> 02:11:47,060
Thank you!

3569
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:49,940
How did you...

3570
02:11:49,940 --> 02:11:50,900
How did you...

3571
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:52,620
How did you make this so quick?

3572
02:11:57,180 --> 02:11:58,300
Oh man...

3573
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:04,260
I really appreciate all the birthday gifts.

3574
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:07,020
I saw some people sing me happy birthday.

3575
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:09,120
And everything.

3576
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:13,100
Yeah, Mint Chord sang me two birthday songs.

3577
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:13,720
And stuff.

3578
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:16,320
Actually, can I listen to this here?

3579
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,440
Actually, will you guys be too embarrassed?

3580
02:12:22,900 --> 02:12:24,920
I haven't listened to it yet.

3581
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:26,620
Will you guys be too embarrassed?

3582
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:28,480
Let's listen.

3583
02:12:38,120 --> 02:12:40,760
Happy birthday to you.

3584
02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:44,120
Happy birthday to you.

3585
02:12:44,120 --> 02:12:44,240
Happy birthday to you.

3586
02:12:44,240 --> 02:12:44,800
Look at them singing.

3587
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:47,940
Happy birthday dear Minto.

3588
02:12:48,180 --> 02:12:49,120
That's me!

3589
02:12:49,540 --> 02:12:52,560
Happy birthday to you.

3590
02:12:54,180 --> 02:12:55,060
Congratulations.

3591
02:13:08,820 --> 02:13:10,980
Happy birthday to you.

3592
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,420
Happy birthday with salutations.

3593
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:15,160
Happy birthday.

3594
02:13:15,380 --> 02:13:18,480
May your sky stay blue.

3595
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:25,160
Happy birthday to you.

3596
02:13:26,260 --> 02:13:27,540
Happy birthday to you.

3597
02:13:27,540 --> 02:13:28,780
Happy birthday to you.

3598
02:13:28,780 --> 02:13:35,120
I don't have Phantom Pay with my birthday so...

3599
02:13:35,120 --> 02:13:36,140
I don't have Phantom Pay with my birthday so...

3600
02:13:36,140 --> 02:13:38,380
This is the next best thing I suppose we could get.

3601
02:13:39,100 --> 02:13:39,820
This is the next best thing I suppose we could get.

3602
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:41,540
Thank you!

3603
02:13:42,040 --> 02:13:42,960
Thank you!

3604
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:43,580
Thank you!

3605
02:13:43,580 --> 02:13:44,140
Thank you!

3606
02:13:44,140 --> 02:13:44,840
Thank you!

3607
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:46,920
Oh my gosh!

3608
02:13:49,420 --> 02:13:50,380
Happy birthday!

3609
02:13:51,380 --> 02:13:51,860
Congratulations!

3610
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:56,700
Thank you for the hug, Super!

3611
02:13:56,900 --> 02:13:57,880
Thank you so much!

3612
02:13:59,750 --> 02:13:59,910
Oh!

3613
02:14:00,150 --> 02:14:01,390
Wait, I saw this too!

3614
02:14:01,550 --> 02:14:02,370
Oh my gosh, wait.

3615
02:14:02,790 --> 02:14:04,210
I wanted to watch it.

3616
02:14:04,310 --> 02:14:06,030
It's on YouTube though, hold on.

3617
02:14:06,790 --> 02:14:08,270
I didn't watch it with sound.

3618
02:14:08,610 --> 02:14:08,850
Oh!

3619
02:14:09,610 --> 02:14:10,910
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3620
02:14:10,910 --> 02:14:12,490
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3621
02:14:12,610 --> 02:14:13,130
I have to...

3622
02:14:13,130 --> 02:14:14,330
Wait, wait, wait.

3623
02:14:14,410 --> 02:14:14,870
Sorry, sorry.

3624
02:14:15,030 --> 02:14:17,830
I have to re-size and everything.

3625
02:14:18,190 --> 02:14:18,790
Here we go.

3626
02:14:20,710 --> 02:14:21,790
This looked crazy.

3627
02:14:21,990 --> 02:14:23,290
I was like, what is this?

3628
02:14:23,670 --> 02:14:24,070
What?

3629
02:14:24,290 --> 02:14:25,670
You guys are so crazy!

3630
02:14:26,670 --> 02:14:29,010
You guys are just so crazy.

3631
02:14:30,050 --> 02:14:32,510
There's just so much going on on my birthday.

3632
02:14:33,030 --> 02:14:34,170
I'm so shocked.

3633
02:14:34,390 --> 02:14:35,730
Wait, is this working?

3634
02:14:35,890 --> 02:14:36,830
Or am I stretching it?

3635
02:14:36,870 --> 02:14:37,410
I can't tell.

3636
02:14:38,410 --> 02:14:39,390
Wait, I'm confused.

3637
02:14:41,430 --> 02:14:42,050
Oh, there we go.

3638
02:14:42,090 --> 02:14:42,650
Okay, good, good, good.

3639
02:14:44,890 --> 02:14:46,570
Sorry, I'm trying to adjust the video.

3640
02:14:47,070 --> 02:14:47,790
Okay, here we go.

3641
02:15:12,040 --> 02:15:13,060
It's on AI Pod!

3642
02:15:16,180 --> 02:15:18,060
Maybe this is the best one to end on, huh?

3643
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:20,620
Oh, it's the whole song, maybe?

3644
02:15:22,260 --> 02:15:23,440
Oh no, it's me!

3645
02:15:24,020 --> 02:15:25,160
Sleeping in your bed.

3646
02:15:28,220 --> 02:15:29,160
Let me tell you something.

3647
02:15:29,940 --> 02:15:31,300
Is there something weird?

3648
02:15:32,060 --> 02:15:33,480
Sleeping in your bed.

3649
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:34,480
Ow!

3650
02:15:34,780 --> 02:15:35,860
Let me tell you something.

3651
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:38,660
Bustin' makes me feel good.

3652
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:43,460
Thank you guys for such a great birthday!

3653
02:15:43,820 --> 02:15:45,880
Oh my gosh, this is so...

3654
02:15:45,880 --> 02:15:46,380
Ow!

3655
02:15:46,700 --> 02:15:47,120
Ow!

3656
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:47,680
What?

3657
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:51,460
Oh my gosh.

3658
02:15:58,020 --> 02:15:59,640
Can't wait to hear the big announcement.

3659
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:01,060
Wait.

3660
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:04,940
Is that all singing and things?

3661
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:06,960
Bop bop, sleeping in your bed.

3662
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:08,220
Bop bop.

3663
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:13,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a miserable man.

3664
02:16:13,860 --> 02:16:15,380
Sleeping in your bed.

3665
02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:16,420
Ow!

3666
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:17,780
Let me tell you something.

3667
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:18,740
Ow!

3668
02:16:19,400 --> 02:16:20,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3669
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:22,480
Bustin',

3670
02:16:40,260 --> 02:16:45,400
bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin'.

3671
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:46,700
Makes me feel good.

3672
02:16:46,700 --> 02:16:47,780
Feel good.

3673
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:48,780
Feel good.

3674
02:16:49,020 --> 02:16:49,660
Feel good.

3675
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:49,760
Feel go...

3676
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:50,420
Oh my gosh, the frog!

3677
02:16:50,580 --> 02:16:51,040
Yeah!

3678
02:16:51,220 --> 02:16:52,280
Get it, break it down!

3679
02:16:52,400 --> 02:16:52,600
Frog!

3680
02:16:56,800 --> 02:16:58,360
Freaky ghost maid!

3681
02:17:00,940 --> 02:17:02,500
Freaky ghost man.

3682
02:17:05,080 --> 02:17:06,740
Freaky man, baby.

3683
02:17:12,630 --> 02:17:14,010
Let me sleep in your bed.

3684
02:17:21,340 --> 02:17:23,340
Sleeping makes me feel good.

3685
02:17:27,680 --> 02:17:29,240
I'm afraid of no sleep.

3686
02:17:29,700 --> 02:17:31,240
I'm afraid of no bed.

3687
02:17:32,400 --> 02:17:33,840
Look at his toes.

3688
02:17:34,460 --> 02:17:35,940
Why is he standing like that?

3689
02:17:36,060 --> 02:17:37,080
In a miserable bed.

3690
02:17:38,260 --> 02:17:40,140
Why is he standing like that?

3691
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:44,980
I don't think I like it anymore.

3692
02:17:48,540 --> 02:17:49,880
He's looking at Bustin'.

3693
02:17:49,880 --> 02:17:52,000
Bustin' Bustin' Bustin' Bustin'

3694
02:17:58,550 --> 02:17:58,930
Busted.

3695
02:17:59,010 --> 02:17:59,950
Look at him go.

3696
02:18:00,250 --> 02:18:00,570
Yeah.

3697
02:18:19,640 --> 02:18:21,700
Bustin' Bustin' Bustin' Busted.

3698
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:31,400
Makes me feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good.

3699
02:18:31,560 --> 02:18:34,340
I think this is gonna demonetize this but that's okay.

3700
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:36,940
Bustin' Bustin' Busted Busted.

3701
02:18:37,880 --> 02:18:38,620
That's okay though.

3702
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:44,740
I hope you guys liked my birthday stream!

3703
02:18:45,080 --> 02:18:46,020
I hope you had fun!

3704
02:18:46,460 --> 02:18:50,520
I hope you, um, uh, eat some good cake!

3705
02:18:51,420 --> 02:18:52,440
Oh, it's over.

3706
02:18:52,860 --> 02:18:53,300
Oh.

3707
02:18:53,540 --> 02:18:55,520
I forgot that's how it ended.

3708
02:18:55,640 --> 02:18:56,420
Oh, wow, wow.

3709
02:18:56,680 --> 02:18:57,560
Oh, wow, wow.

3710
02:18:59,880 --> 02:19:01,460
And, um, yeah!

3711
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:02,840
Thank you guys!

3712
02:19:03,140 --> 02:19:07,700
I had a lot of fun, and I will see you guys, um, another time!

3713
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:09,580
Oh, tomorrow, probably.

3714
02:19:09,680 --> 02:19:11,720
I don't know what my schedule is this week.

3715
02:19:11,800 --> 02:19:13,020
I'm streaming tomorrow, though.

3716
02:19:13,060 --> 02:19:14,120
I will be, I will be.

3717
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:17,440
And, um... yeah!

3718
02:19:32,440 --> 02:19:34,340
Thanks for a great birthday!

3719
02:19:34,780 --> 02:19:35,760
Thank you!

3720
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:40,420
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you...

3721
02:19:57,510 --> 02:19:58,630
Thank you!

3722
02:19:59,950 --> 02:20:02,770
I can only just say thank you.

3723
02:20:02,870 --> 02:20:04,530
I just feel so grateful right now.

3724
02:20:04,950 --> 02:20:05,910
