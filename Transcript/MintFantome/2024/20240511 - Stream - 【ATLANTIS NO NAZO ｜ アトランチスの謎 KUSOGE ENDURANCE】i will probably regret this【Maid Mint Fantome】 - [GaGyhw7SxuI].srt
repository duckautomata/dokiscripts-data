1
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,540
Welcome back!

2
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,000
Thank you very much!

3
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,800
Oh, sorry for the delay.

4
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,740
I...

5
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,200
I...

6
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,440
Look, I'm jumping.

7
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,540
Oh!

8
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,660
I didn't do that.

9
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,140
That's not me.

10
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,700
I am jumping though.

11
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,840
Look at me go.

12
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,980
I don't know why he's stopping.

13
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,020
Welcome everybody to Atlantis no nazo.

14
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,040
Oh, I got it.

15
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,540
Nice.

16
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,200
He's acting on his own, honestly.

17
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,540
I'm surprised he's still alive.

18
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,920
Look at him go.

19
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,000
How does the rage meter work?

20
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:45,940
Go!

21
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,620
Jump!

22
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,660
It just happens.

23
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,680
You know?

24
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,120
Right now it's at 0% rage.

25
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,740
0% rage.

26
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,420
Everybody.

27
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,500
We're good.

28
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,740
Everything is calm.

29
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,480
We're all good.

30
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,280
Thanks for the gift, Petty!

31
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:23,020
If you are unaware of this game, it is just a notoriously difficult platformer like old from Famicom era game.

32
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,500
It's Atlantis no nazo.

33
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,720
I don't even know what to say.

34
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,420
Sorry, my brain is so out of sorts today.

35
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,620
One month!

36
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,960
Thank you guys!

37
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:42,900
Wait.

38
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,360
Happy one month.

39
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,480
Are these like one months from before I graduated or...

40
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,660
It's weird saying that.

41
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,040
Or has it been a month since I opened up memberships?

42
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,560
I can't.

43
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,520
It's been one month since you opened up?

44
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,660
Oh my gosh.

45
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,880
Thank you guys!

46
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,200
Thank you guys!

47
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:07,720
Thank you!

48
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,580
Okay, I'm really confused because memberships are showing up.

49
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,760
Okay, hold on.

50
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,360
Let me ask...

51
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,040
Let me check real quick for Streamlabs.

52
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,200
I checked last night, but nothing was weird.

53
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:20,880
Um...

54
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,620
But yeah, so I'm gonna do my best with this game.

55
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,500
There's 99 levels.

56
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,120
There's 90...

57
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,860
Wait, what is this?

58
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,080
Interesting.

59
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,540
Um, there's 99 levels.

60
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,860
So I'm gonna try and clear everything.

61
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,980
I'm gonna do my best.

62
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,700
Excited for Kamige.

63
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,080
Streamlabs test.

64
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,200
Well, I think there were some gifted so it might be a little...

65
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,680
Sorry, my brain is really today.

66
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,740
I'm so sorry.

67
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,500
Uh...

68
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,440
Why did...

69
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,000
What is going on?

70
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,920
Wait...

71
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,940
Eh?

72
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
I think...

73
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,600
I think Streamlabs changed.

74
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,260
Eh?

75
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,180
Huh?

76
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,340
Okay, that worked, but...

77
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,480
That worked.

78
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,640
Eh?

79
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,930
I'm confused.

80
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,250
Huh?

81
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,430
They changed the whole side.

82
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,050
I don't understand it anymore.

83
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,650
Wait, where do I...

84
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,430
Where's my custom ones?

85
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,370
Oh no...

86
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,050
Wait...

87
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,410
Eh?

88
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,090
Oh, eh?

89
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:40,530
Eh?

90
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,310
Eh?

91
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:41,930
Eh?

92
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:42,990
Eh?

93
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,450
Eh?

94
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,530
Oh, tip variation.

95
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,430
Eh?

96
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,750
Worked!

97
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,330
Yubi!

98
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,430
Okay, that worked.

99
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,730
Okay, sorry guys for that little delay.

100
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,170
Some of these things I can't test.

101
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,670
Unless I'm on stream, right?

102
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:14,330
So...

103
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,250
The CPU...

104
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,570
CPU in the demo mode is pretty bad.

105
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,590
Now, I'm not gonna look... I'm not gonna be as bad as this guy at all.

106
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,270
So, all you can do... Here, I'll show you guys.

107
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:24,570
Let's...

108
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,350
Let's start.

109
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,070
Oh my gosh.

110
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,390
First zone mystery adventure start.

111
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,470
Okay, this is just to show you guys how the game works.

112
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,470
So you can throw bombs.

113
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,450
You have to avoid the poop.

114
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,650
And you can duck.

115
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:36,750
Oh!

116
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,730
And you can jump.

117
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,690
And that's it.

118
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,830
When you jump, you can't... Oh my gosh.

119
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,590
You can't move while you're jumping.

120
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,190
It can make things quite difficult.

121
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,170
Point!

122
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:47,930
Point!

123
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,550
Watch out for the poop.

124
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:53,910
But um...

125
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,550
Maybe I could jump over those guys.

126
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:58,690
Treasure!

127
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:03,150
And we're here to discover the mystery of Atlantis.

128
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,570
What?

129
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,410
Oh my gosh.

130
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,470
I didn't see that guy!

131
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,330
The mystery of Atlantis.

132
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,670
Look out!

133
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,230
I'm gonna keep going this way.

134
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,610
Wait, how do I...

135
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,170
Oh my gosh.

136
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,170
Don't poop on me.

137
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,690
Uh...

138
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,170
Up?

139
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:21,750
Up?

140
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:21,950
No.

141
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,930
Um...

142
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,010
Hold on.

143
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,730
Maybe bomb it?

144
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:27,470
Bomb?

145
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,030
Bomb?

146
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:30,590
Bomb?

147
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:32,530
Okay...

148
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,990
You have to throw a bomb at the door.

149
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,510
Oh, I tried!

150
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,610
Let's try this way.

151
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,390
No worries.

152
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,370
We have seven... five lives.

153
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,950
We have five lives, everybody.

154
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,150
It's all good.

155
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,070
Oh my gosh.

156
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:53,630
That was so close.

157
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,990
Treasure!

158
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,210
Yeah!

159
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:58,650
Okay.

160
00:08:59,330 --> 00:08:59,910
We're good.

161
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:01,870
Everything's fine.

162
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,830
Don't poop on me.

163
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,630
The little... the poops are like such a full shape.

164
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,710
Like a whole poop.

165
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,930
Like it couldn't be like a little pellet.

166
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,090
No.

167
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,290
It's like a whole poop.

168
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,210
I'm gonna try opening that door again.

169
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:21,810
Um...

170
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,310
Maybe it needs to get like right on top of it.

171
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,630
Ah!

172
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,260
No worries.

173
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,420
Did I open it?

174
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,020
I don't even know.

175
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,680
Oh my gosh.

176
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,440
Oh my gosh.

177
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,500
Run!

178
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,340
Maybe using the d-pad would be better.

179
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,300
I don't know why I was...

180
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,460
Okay.

181
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,400
It did open?

182
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,720
Okay, nice, nice, nice, nice.

183
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,720
Run.

184
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,920
Oh my gosh.

185
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh, throw!

186
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,100
No!

187
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,820
I opened it again.

188
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,260
Run!

189
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,360
Wait!

190
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,460
Oh!

191
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,700
I thought there was a guy down there.

192
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,240
We're fine.

193
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,540
Don't go through there.

194
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,340
Oh.

195
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:32,920
Oh.

196
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,420
Oh.

197
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:33,960
What?

198
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,460
Why did you stand back up?

199
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,240
Mr. Adventurer.

200
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,800
Press down and drop a b-bomb at your feet.

201
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,240
So funny thing, I'll show you.

202
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,120
Oh.

203
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,100
Maybe... Hold on.

204
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,300
I'll show you.

205
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,480
Pretty sure...

206
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,640
You can die to your own bombs.

207
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,920
Cause it's happened to me.

208
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,380
I haven't played so much of this.

209
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,280
I got to stage, like, three, I think.

210
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,540
So...

211
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:10,780
Oh!

212
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,200
Oh, how did I live?

213
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,920
How did I live?

214
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't know.

215
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:14,900
Yes!

216
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,080
Wait, eleventh?

217
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,700
Okay, you can't crouch and move.

218
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,260
Okay.

219
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,460
There's lots of treasure in here, though.

220
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:27,900
Nice.

221
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:30,820
Oh.

222
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,980
Okay, nice, nice.

223
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,380
Wait.

224
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,620
How did I jump so high before?

225
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,540
Hey!

226
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:39,900
Throw!

227
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,000
Throw!

228
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,300
Yeah!

229
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,060
Wait, I can't get through there, actually.

230
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,000
Now that I think about it.

231
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:48,620
Oh.

232
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,220
How do you get past here?

233
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,260
Huh?

234
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,730
Open the door for me, little worm!

235
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,710
Oh, there's more worms over here, too.

236
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:23,770
Wait!

237
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:24,490
Wait!

238
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,450
Oh my gosh.

239
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,030
When you jump, you can't move.

240
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,070
Okay, move around.

241
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,410
I made it to the 52nd...

242
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,290
52nd?

243
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:45,770
54th?

244
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,690
Whatever one that was.

245
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,850
Good job, everybody.

246
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,830
Let's try going through that first door.

247
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,350
Actually, I know that leads to the second one.

248
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,250
I was really curious about the other one.

249
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,350
Which is...

250
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,970
How did I live?

251
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:57,650
How did I live?

252
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,270
How did I live?

253
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:58,890
How did I live?

254
00:12:58,890 --> 00:12:59,390
How did I live?

255
00:12:59,510 --> 00:12:59,890
Oh!

256
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:09,930
Mom and Mum!

257
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,530
Mom and Mum!

258
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,410
Yippee!

259
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,570
Where was that door?

260
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,270
I think it's a pain in the butt that the enemies are randomized.

261
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:36,450
I stood up too soon.

262
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,170
No way!

263
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,330
I stood up too soon.

264
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,710
Okay, okay, okay.

265
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,050
That's fine.

266
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,790
Okay, second zone.

267
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,460
Wait, those go down.

268
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,360
Oh, treasure, treasure.

269
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,020
Nice.

270
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,920
I don't want to be got by my own bomb though.

271
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,280
Okay, nice, nice.

272
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,800
Let's go up.

273
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,400
I have no idea where I'm going.

274
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,700
It's okay.

275
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,360
Only 600 seconds.

276
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,100
I know, right?

277
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,220
At least it's unlimited bombs.

278
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:47,860
Oh my god.

279
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,580
That was close.

280
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,600
Okay.

281
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,040
Nice.

282
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,960
Yeah, get out of here.

283
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,160
Get out of here.

284
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,840
Run.

285
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,180
Nice.

286
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,980
That was close.

287
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,400
Okay, this guy again.

288
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,040
Nice.

289
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,020
Where's the door?

290
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,220
Oh.

291
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,360
Oh, but there's a treasure down there.

292
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,800
Third zone.

293
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,600
If you run, jump and immediately jump again, you'll jump higher.

294
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,020
Oh my god.

295
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,360
Are you sure about that?

296
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,320
Oh my god.

297
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,400
Oh my god.

298
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:38,960
That was so close.

299
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,020
Oh my god.

300
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,440
You can't move when you jump.

301
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,320
So it's like...

302
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,780
You have to... Oh my god.

303
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,600
Okay.

304
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,100
Okay, okay, okay.

305
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:53,740
Huh.

306
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,840
Huh.

307
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:56,620
Whoa.

308
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,000
This dang fish.

309
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,580
Huh.

310
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,580
Huh.

311
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,540
Okay.

312
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,890
Full commit every jump.

313
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,810
It feels like...

314
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,490
Let's try this way.

315
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:13,770
Oh.

316
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,690
Oh my god.

317
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,250
Leave me alone.

318
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,970
This guy was targeting me.

319
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,250
It feels like...

320
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,070
Jump King in that regard.

321
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,750
You know what I mean?

322
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,030
Where it's like...

323
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,490
Jump King.

324
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,330
You have to...

325
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:26,830
Commit.

326
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,490
Commit to your...

327
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:29,970
To your jump.

328
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:48,210
Jump.

329
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:49,370
Jump.

330
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,330
Oh my god.

331
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,230
Oh.

332
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:51,950
It's a good thing I didn't jump.

333
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,270
Jump.

334
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:53,330
Wait.

335
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,330
Six though?

336
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,230
Wait.

337
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:57,510
What?

338
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,390
What just happened?

339
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,310
Wait.

340
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:01,990
How did I get here?

341
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:02,550
Oh my god.

342
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,390
What is that?

343
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:05,810
What is that?

344
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:06,090
What is that?

345
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,010
What is that?

346
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,130
I got something.

347
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,070
Eight.

348
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:13,590
Eight.

349
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,190
So...

350
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,700
Oh my god.

351
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,760
I knew there were warps in this game but I don't know where they are so I'm kind of just like...

352
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,400
Oh.

353
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,440
We'll find it.

354
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,360
Maybe the pitfall is a secret.

355
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:34,960
You think so?

356
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,440
Okay.

357
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,260
We can't go that way.

358
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,360
This pitfall right here?

359
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,500
I have room.

360
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,200
I have one life left.

361
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,500
I have one life left and I don't remember how I got to the sixth zone to get those shoes.

362
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,660
Should I risk it for the biscuit?

363
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:53,980
No.

364
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,660
Nice.

365
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,520
Oh my god.

366
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,180
Oh my god.

367
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,900
Just throw the bomb.

368
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,500
Just throw the bomb.

369
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,680
There's no risk in throwing the bomb.

370
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,420
Only my sanity.

371
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,480
Oh my god.

372
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,600
Oh my gosh.

373
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,140
Sorry.

374
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,060
I don't mean to scream.

375
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,140
This game is just a little stressful is all.

376
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:24,660
Hey.

377
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:24,880
Hey.

378
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,040
Hey.

379
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,320
Oh.

380
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,000
I ended up killing him.

381
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,000
Oh my god.

382
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,360
The momentum.

383
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,620
No.

384
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,840
The momentum.

385
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,280
Get me going.

386
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,320
Oh.

387
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,800
The mystery adventure.

388
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:43,920
Oh.

389
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,660
The adventure starts.

390
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,700
Okay.

391
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:02,840
To give you guys any idea, I believe for Korone, it took her 11, almost 12 hours to beat.

392
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:09,820
And for Game Center, for Arino, it took him 8 hours, I think, to beat.

393
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,620
And he used a guy.

394
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,730
Which actually...

395
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,460
Which actually I have as well.

396
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,800
This is the same exact one that he used on the show.

397
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,860
And it shows you...

398
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,480
It shows you the different warps and things that you can do.

399
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,940
So if we get stuck, we're gonna use it.

400
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,240
Okay?

401
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,520
I'm not gonna use it.

402
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:43,600
So...

403
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,020
We're gonna use the guide.

404
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,660
If we get stuck.

405
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,180
Okay?

406
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,940
I'm ser...

407
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,240
I'm serious.

408
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,460
Nice subway map.

409
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,540
Oh my gosh.

410
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,160
That was so close.

411
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,780
I don't know what the hitbox is on this thing at all.

412
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,440
Wait.

413
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:02,920
So...

414
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,740
This one took me further.

415
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,180
Maybe I should do this one then.

416
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,420
11th zone.

417
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,240
It'll tell you in the level where the warp is.

418
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:11,840
I...

419
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,500
I'm not sure.

420
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,060
It was this one.

421
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,160
It was this one.

422
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,520
Wasn't it?

423
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,060
That we...

424
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:19,620
52nd!

425
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,420
Can't believe...

426
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,880
Streamer is a cheater.

427
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,680
Oh my god.

428
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,440
It's not cheating!

429
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,760
Why would they provide the map and the guide if they didn't want you to use it?

430
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,460
Oh my god.

431
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:35,800
Wait.

432
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:36,820
Okay.

433
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,900
This is where I learn how to jump at least.

434
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:40,940
Okay.

435
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,220
Hold on.

436
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:42,660
Oh.

437
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,120
Oh.

438
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,400
Oh.

439
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:43,500
Oh.

440
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:43,920
Oh.

441
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,540
Oh.

442
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:48,640
There's a bug!

443
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,420
Okay.

444
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,640
Okay.

445
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,040
So far, so good.

446
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,600
What is that?

447
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,680
Oh.

448
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,080
I got a clock.

449
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,610
But also, I don't think calling me a cheater is very nice.

450
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,830
So please actually don't do that.

451
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,070
Because I think if I...

452
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,030
You could call me that if I use save states.

453
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:16,790
But I'm not.

454
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,890
So please don't.

455
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:19,950
Okay.

456
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,950
Umm...

457
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,630
Are there two of you now?

458
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,290
Why won't you shoot bombs when I tell you to?

459
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:34,450
Oh my gosh.

460
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,130
No!

461
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:37,970
Go away!

462
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:38,750
Go away!

463
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:39,610
Go away!

464
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,210
Go away!

465
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,130
Go away!

466
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:42,450
Okay.

467
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,530
Okay.

468
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:43,530
Okay.

469
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,950
Wow, I traveled.

470
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,690
No one means it maliciously.

471
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,590
They're just teasing.

472
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,530
Yeah, but I'm telling you I don't want the teasing today.

473
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,690
At least not that kind of teasing.

474
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,170
Because I don't think it's really fair to me.

475
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,780
Thank you!

476
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,240
You can say skill issue all you want.

477
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:24,680
I just think I take offense when it comes to cheating because I have too much pride.

478
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,660
Even if I have cheated in my life, I don't like to admit.

479
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,640
Or my afterlife even.

480
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,700
This one.

481
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,020
Okay.

482
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,710
She's a loser, but not a cheater.

483
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,450
Oh my gosh.

484
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,710
Go away bug!

485
00:22:59,550 --> 00:22:59,990
Yes!

486
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:02,610
Yes!

487
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,290
Aim!

488
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:07,730
Aim!

489
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,790
Okay, nice.

490
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:12,830
Nice.

491
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,210
I did it!

492
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:16,510
I did it!

493
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:16,850
I did it!

494
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:17,190
I did it!

495
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:17,530
I did it!

496
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,150
Oh my god, please.

497
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,210
Thank you.

498
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,290
Is there... why does this look so suspicious?

499
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,590
Okay, maybe it's nothing.

500
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,250
I don't want to get caught by the bugs.

501
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,030
No!

502
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:31,610
Please!

503
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,830
Okay, okay.

504
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:36,630
Oh, okay.

505
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,570
It's just part of the set design.

506
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,030
Please!

507
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:41,890
Please!

508
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,150
Let's go.

509
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,250
Wait, do I have eight lives?

510
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,170
Mommy!

511
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,530
Wait, how do I kill the mommy?

512
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:03,590
Oh!

513
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,650
Three bombs.

514
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,190
Okay.

515
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,150
Okay.

516
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:12,510
One.

517
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:13,870
Two.

518
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:15,530
Three.

519
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,910
Can I jump over this?

520
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:18,690
Oh!

521
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,070
Oh, interesting.

522
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:20,470
Okay.

523
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,530
I can jump...

524
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:22,690
Up?

525
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:23,190
Wait.

526
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:24,770
Oh my god!

527
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:24,950
No!

528
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,690
They're coming from behind!

529
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,320
Oh my god.

530
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,800
No, don't kill me.

531
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,560
Maybe I jump here?

532
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,300
Open.

533
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,400
Open.

534
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,060
Open.

535
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,760
Oh, here we go.

536
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,020
Here we go.

537
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,640
Okay.

538
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,180
Fifty-seventh zone.

539
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,400
Oh my god.

540
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,040
Oh!

541
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,880
Oh, wow!

542
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,440
Oh my god!

543
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,580
Oh my god!

544
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
Oh my god!

545
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,040
Oh my god!

546
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:11,420
What

547
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:16,290
is going on?

548
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,190
Okay, just go.

549
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,090
Yo!

550
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,670
Oh my god!

551
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,210
No, no, no, no, no!

552
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,610
Maybe he can... maybe... maybe...

553
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,630
Can I jump?

554
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:29,850
Okay.

555
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,710
Oh god, please get me out of here!

556
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,750
I don't wanna be in there!

557
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,810
Land is not so anymore!

558
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,690
I hate it!

559
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:37,910
Okay.

560
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,510
We can just stay up top for now.

561
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,430
Probably.

562
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,150
It's probably safe.

563
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:43,090
Okay.

564
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,090
He's gonna fall.

565
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,170
Idiot.

566
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,550
Oh my god, my eyes!

567
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,430
Two!

568
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,070
Two!

569
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:52,850
Oh!

570
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,250
Oh!

571
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,130
Throw, throw, throw, throw, throw!

572
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:55,850
Okay.

573
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,030
Throw, throw, throw, throw, throw!

574
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,730
Okay, we're gaming.

575
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,210
We're gaming.

576
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:00,230
We're gaming.

577
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,930
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

578
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:04,410
Oh!

579
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:04,890
Nice!

580
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:05,630
We got both of them!

581
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,150
We're gaming!

582
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:06,550
We're gaming!

583
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,120
Please get me out of this zone!

584
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:25,560
Please!

585
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,780
I thought that would work too.

586
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,580
Oh my god!

587
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,240
Don't take me back to zone... what is this?

588
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,600
57?

589
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,880
This zone sucks.

590
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,240
This zone sucks.

591
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,640
This zone sucks so much.

592
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,660
My eyes!

593
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,780
How am I supposed to play like this?

594
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,540
Thank god you have unlimited bombs.

595
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,940
But not unlimited time.

596
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,820
I'm so sorry, you guys.

597
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,480
I had no idea.

598
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,600
Come on!

599
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,080
Die already!

600
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,420
Okay.

601
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,600
But not me.

602
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,680
Okay.

603
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,980
I'm gonna wait for him to drop.

604
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,420
Yeah.

605
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:17,620
Okay.

606
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,320
Save.

607
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:20,620
Okay.

608
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,360
Okay.

609
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,580
That was close.

610
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,780
I always see something on like the right side of my screen.

611
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,080
It's just gonna fall right off.

612
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:39,800
No!

613
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,640
I don't think it's worth it, you guys.

614
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,960
I'm staying in this zone.

615
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,080
I don't think it's worth it.

616
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,360
I'd rather just reset.

617
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,180
Okay.

618
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,360
I just gotta be good.

619
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,360
I just gotta get good.

620
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,320
Speedrun.

621
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:03,950
Okay.

622
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:06,670
Just...

623
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,040
Run and jump man!

624
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,820
Run and jump man!

625
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,160
Oh my god.

626
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,600
I can't with these guys.

627
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,700
The slimes.

628
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,360
Oh.

629
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,160
Hooyah!

630
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,580
Hooyah!

631
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,240
I'm just gonna die.

632
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,740
I don't wanna do this stage anymore.

633
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,980
We'll come back to it when we have to come back to the 57th stage.

634
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,200
No!

635
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,430
Please!

636
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,910
Rip the rave cave.

637
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:01,750
Why?

638
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:07,610
Okay.

639
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,330
Okay.

640
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:09,450
Okay.

641
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,910
The mystery begins.

642
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:13,990
Oh my god.

643
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,340
Why did I...

644
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:21,750
It's okay.

645
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,390
They said that if a...

646
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,590
They say that if a bird poops on you, it's good luck.

647
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,290
I think.

648
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,150
So don't worry about it.

649
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,730
Why is this guy coming up from behind me?

650
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,770
Don't worry about everybody.

651
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,000
Now, also here...

652
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,700
I was able to get to the sixth zone.

653
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,620
I can only see green now.

654
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,680
Me too, honestly.

655
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,320
What?

656
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,500
Oh my god.

657
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:57,800
Wait.

658
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,900
Let me try going to the left actually.

659
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:05,880
Wait.

660
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,620
Can I make it through there?

661
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,180
Oh.

662
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,660
Never mind.

663
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,740
Never mind.

664
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,320
Wait.

665
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,050
Wait.

666
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,090
Oh, treasure.

667
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,910
I don't know what the treasure is worth.

668
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:30,690
I don't know if you can only get things through picking them up, like the items that we found, or if you can get things in treasure as well.

669
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:31,970
I'm not sure.

670
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,030
The warp is all the way to the right.

671
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,730
Yeah, but I wanted to see if there was a second door as well on the left.

672
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,690
It was up here though, wasn't it?

673
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:49,530
Okay.

674
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,030
Okay, there it is.

675
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,190
But the treasure...

676
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,250
Oh well.

677
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,950
Alright, third zone.

678
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,120
I forgot about this area, to be honest.

679
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,140
I forgot about the fish.

680
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,060
Ah!

681
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,700
I sent a Streamlabs warning about the flashing lights.

682
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,940
But it got backed up.

683
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,080
Oh, thank you for try...

684
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,560
Oh, heads up.

685
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,460
They might have fixed on the switch.

686
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,700
But I remember one stage having horrible flashing lights.

687
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,100
I see your warning.

688
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,880
I'm heeding your warning.

689
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,980
There's like no warning for the fish though.

690
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,740
And it's kind of messing me up.

691
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,340
Oh!

692
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,590
I was so close too.

693
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,750
I'm so frustrated.

694
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,530
I was so close.

695
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,350
Okay.

696
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,250
That's it.

697
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,440
That's it.

698
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,640
That's a cute passing that level.

699
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,140
We'll see if we...

700
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,620
There's a warp past it though, you know, so we don't have to do it again.

701
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,720
As a certified kusage enthusiast, I've been waiting for nearly 3 years for this.

702
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,540
Well, the time has come, unfortunately.

703
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,360
Sorry, there was an error.

704
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,920
Oh!

705
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,880
I killed him!

706
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,120
Yeah, take that.

707
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,200
Stupid.

708
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,860
The fish!

709
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,560
The fish!

710
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,980
The fish...

711
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,100
There's no way to know where they come either!

712
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,220
Oh my god!

713
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:03,360
I

714
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,340
waited for a fish to come!

715
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,360
I waited!

716
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,040
I waited!

717
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,040
Oh my god.

718
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,780
The fish also waited.

719
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,480
No, I'm not raging yet.

720
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,780
The fish comes every 225 frames.

721
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,080
So it just happens to be every time I jump, eh?

722
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,680
Boom boom.

723
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,300
Look at how happy our guy is.

724
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,880
Go on his little Atlantis adventure.

725
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,140
What could you think the treasure is?

726
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,440
Of Atlantis.

727
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,860
Or not the treasure.

728
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,820
The mystery?

729
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,360
Oh my god.

730
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,400
The mystery of Atlantis.

731
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:58,700
Also!

732
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,080
There was the one where we warp!

733
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,980
To the sixth stage.

734
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,600
What was it?

735
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,880
It was on the third stage.

736
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,980
What was it?

737
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,560
What was it?

738
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,520
What hole?

739
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,280
Oh!

740
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,400
Sorry, I was not looking.

741
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,660
You fell in the pit.

742
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,760
Yeah, but I don't remember which pit it was.

743
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,300
There were a lot of pits.

744
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,360
Not the arm variety.

745
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,340
Though I wish they were.

746
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,880
Wow, there's a party going on in there.

747
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,900
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

748
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,180
Da da da da da da da da da da da da.

749
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,260
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

750
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,240
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

751
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:17,720
You would think that throwing a second bomb would like keep them down, you know what I mean?

752
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,640
But it does not.

753
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,080
In fact, they are immune.

754
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,040
Oh my gosh.

755
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:31,200
The best thing about streaming this game is the genuine hot tips and wild lies of trolls and one guys are indistinguishable.

756
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,380
It's true!

757
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,240
It's true!

758
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,440
Actually, this time we can get the treasure down here.

759
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,620
Let's get the treasure.

760
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,480
What could it be?

761
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,340
Because this game is just...

762
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:51,080
You could say, drop a bomb here and you'll get to level 55 and you could be right!

763
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,680
You could be absolutely correct!

764
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,980
And who am I to...

765
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,580
Oh, there's more.

766
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,860
Who am I to say that you're incorrect?

767
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,640
Oh, nice.

768
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,100
Wait, there's even more!

769
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,740
What is the point of going all the way down here?

770
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,740
Oh gosh.

771
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,860
I'm gonna run out of time though.

772
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,140
Maybe.

773
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,380
Wait, is it just infinite level?

774
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,520
Huh?

775
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,780
I'm gonna run out of time though.

776
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,220
Wait, just keep going, keep going.

777
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:23,780
Oh!

778
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,820
There's another door!

779
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,240
Ninth zone!

780
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,480
Ninth zone!

781
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,160
Okay.

782
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,260
And we got...

783
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,040
What is that?

784
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,760
Hold on...

785
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,740
I got a...

786
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,420
Something.

787
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:43,840
Eight!

788
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,390
Eighth zone!

789
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:52,550
Huh?

790
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,090
What?

791
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,930
Wait, I haven't been here though before, right?

792
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,290
Oh my god.

793
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,290
Thank goodness I threw that.

794
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,970
The momentum is definitely gonna bite me in the butt.

795
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,530
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

796
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,890
It's in the zone.

797
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,010
I don't know where I'm at.

798
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:24,530
Kwee!

799
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:25,690
Kwee!

800
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:26,990
Kwee!

801
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,710
There we go.

802
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:28,270
Nice.

803
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,630
Big jump.

804
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:38,960
It's making me wanna pass more of the regular doors and find the secret.

805
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,080
Oh!

806
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:41,880
Oh!

807
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,260
Oh!

808
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,020
Ah!

809
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,320
Okay, hold on.

810
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,180
I'm gonna go from here.

811
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:51,540
Ah!

812
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,910
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

813
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,890
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

814
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,090
Kwee!

815
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:06,930
The overcorrection.

816
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:10,790
I know because like when you jump you instinctly wanna like...

817
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:14,790
You instinctly want to press on like, you know...

818
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,690
To move forward.

819
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,770
Cause you're just like, oh my gosh.

820
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,950
And then the momentum too.

821
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:23,750
Okay.

822
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,650
Okay, nice.

823
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:30,630
Kwee!

824
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:31,910
Kwee!

825
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:42,100
I think it's very funny that the guide to this game basically encourages you to like...

826
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,640
The guide is just like, oh by the way, there are warps.

827
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,060
Like, you can just totally...

828
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,860
You can just totally skip a bunch of this game if you really want to.

829
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:52,440
Ah!

830
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,040
Hi,

831
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:58,400
man.

832
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:58,820
Hello.

833
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,520
Hello.

834
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,230
If I were a hidden door...

835
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,450
I'd be right...

836
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,490
Right there.

837
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,740
Alright.

838
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,120
I'd be right here.

839
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,660
Dang.

840
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,820
I tried.

841
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,460
Oh my gosh, please.

842
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,260
There we go.

843
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,200
Where is the door here anyway?

844
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,700
We haven't seen it yet.

845
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,390
Jumping in this game is so...

846
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,230
I died to my OPA.

847
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,330
No, Biggie.

848
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,570
No, Biggie.

849
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,420
Oh, that was close.

850
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,160
That was a close one.

851
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,060
No, Biggie.

852
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,840
I'm getting the hang of the jumping though.

853
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,640
I think.

854
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:32,760
Oh my god.

855
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,840
That was close.

856
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,380
That was so close.

857
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:39,820
Oh my god.

858
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,780
That was close too.

859
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,400
Because I could have died to my own bomb again.

860
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:46,880
Oh

861
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,280
my gosh.

862
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,800
We made it.

863
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,500
We made it.

864
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:58,920
Okay.

865
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,880
This is gonna be like...

866
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,020
Do I even have time to make it through this?

867
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,720
Okay, hold on.

868
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,740
Oh gosh.

869
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:08,880
Okay, hold on.

870
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,560
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

871
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,320
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

872
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,760
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

873
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,200
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

874
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,100
I think if I just drop...

875
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,840
Oh, I ran out of time.

876
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,640
Oh, I ran out of time.

877
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,080
Yo.

878
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,660
Okay.

879
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,060
Speedrun.

880
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:33,820
Oh.

881
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,000
Oh my gosh.

882
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,920
I think I pixel perfect that.

883
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:41,700
Wait.

884
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,300
Okay.

885
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,240
Yo, I'm gaming?

886
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:52,670
Okay.

887
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,520
Okay.

888
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

889
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,020
I thought like...

890
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:01,600
Oh my god.

891
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,460
I was like, what killed me on the wall?

892
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,140
Okay.

893
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:07,580
Nice.

894
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,340
Nice.

895
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,420
No, no, not nice.

896
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:13,920
Nice.

897
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:15,780
Okay.

898
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,620
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice.

899
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,000
Where's the door?

900
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,900
Did someone sign the door to darkness?

901
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:27,700
Did someone sign the door to darkness?

902
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,300
No, not treasure.

903
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,160
Where's the door?

904
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:42,860
Where's...

905
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:43,840
Where's...

906
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,640
Tenth zone.

907
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:49,600
Let's go.

908
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:51,840
Oh, no.

909
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,620
No, wait.

910
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,380
No, no, no, no.

911
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,500
No, no, no, no.

912
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,700
I know this zone.

913
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,400
I know this zone.

914
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,260
I think Arino spent like three hours on this zone.

915
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:10,950
I know this zone.

916
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:13,130
Okay.

917
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:13,670
Okay.

918
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:14,330
Alright.

919
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:14,410
Alright.

920
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:17,810
Nice.

921
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:18,490
Star.

922
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,780
This game is making me stressed.

923
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,760
I'm not even playing it.

924
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,480
I want the star though.

925
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,080
I don't think I can get it.

926
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,680
We'll come back for you.

927
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,660
It's a nice...

928
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,900
sunny day.

929
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,550
Can you jump on the clouds?

930
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:01,030
No, I don't think so.

931
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:01,550
I don't know.

932
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,670
I didn't try.

933
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:05,470
Back to zone one, everybody.

934
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,470
Oh, good troller.

935
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:12,710
Are you good?

936
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,130
I should have jumped.

937
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:32,350
I think jumping on the clouds would be too kind.

938
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,710
The game would be like...

939
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,450
I did it again.

940
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:39,170
I did it again.

941
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:41,890
I saw the one guy and I just ignored the other guy.

942
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:44,930
First in many months.

943
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:45,710
Ghosty.

944
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:46,290
Thank you.

945
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:49,610
Need an item for cloud walking.

946
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:50,250
Okay.

947
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:50,510
Okay.

948
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:50,730
Okay.

949
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:54,570
Okay.

950
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:58,690
I should just jump over these guys.

951
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,950
Now which way do I want to go?

952
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,010
Why do you have so much poop?

953
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:07,410
What are these birds eating?

954
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,190
What are these birds eating?

955
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:11,450
They have so much poop.

956
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,010
You're humming along to the beat.

957
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:23,610
This is the best.

958
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,010
Which way do we go, guys?

959
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,760
They eat too much fat.

960
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,320
They're eating my dead body once I'm dead.

961
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,320
My corpse.

962
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,800
That's why they're so...

963
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,100
That's why they're able to eat...

964
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,120
or poop so much.

965
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,100
Because they're just constantly feeding.

966
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,500
I'm gonna game over in the first sound.

967
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,440
Okay.

968
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,780
Which way do we go, though?

969
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,860
It was stage 3.

970
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,280
That got us to stage 6.

971
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,600
So let's try and get to stage 3 and figure out how to get to stage 6.

972
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,280
We'll drop down.

973
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,420
Click.

974
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:41,680
Click.

975
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,320
Click.

976
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:42,900
Click.

977
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,220
Click.

978
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:45,740
Click.

979
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:47,960
Click.

980
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,660
This way.

981
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,380
Good plan.

982
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,400
Okay.

983
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,160
Still no go that way.

984
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,280
Treasure.

985
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,460
Please.

986
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,040
Wait.

987
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,600
Yeah, we're going to the second one.

988
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,760
We're going to the first door, I mean.

989
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,820
Because that got us to stage 3.

990
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:37,860
This one right here.

991
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

992
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,920
First, can I help it?

993
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,500
They're just really nervous around you.

994
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:44,820
Okay.

995
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,840
Oh my gosh!

996
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,000
So I got past a little bit, I think.

997
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,600
Before I fell.

998
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,240
Should I try this one?

999
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,980
Should I try this one, you think?

1000
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,980
These fish, I know.

1001
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:08,680
Okay.

1002
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:10,800
No!

1003
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,320
I can't remember where I...

1004
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,960
Maybe it was a tiny one like this.

1005
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,420
Okay, I'm just going to try this one.

1006
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,400
Nope.

1007
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:24,840
Happy one month.

1008
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:25,880
Thank you guys so much!

1009
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,580
Oh my gosh, I can't believe I'm playing this.

1010
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,980
I have one month.

1011
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:35,440
One month of membership.

1012
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,240
Thank you everybody.

1013
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,420
Oh my gosh.

1014
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:40,760
Okay.

1015
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,580
This is the one I just tried.

1016
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:43,480
Okay.

1017
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:43,480
This is the one I just tried.

1018
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,200
It was one of these, wasn't it?

1019
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,060
Oh, fish going!

1020
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,460
I don't know which one it was!

1021
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,520
Yeah, thanks for 200k.

1022
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:53,300
Okay.

1023
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,080
I swear, I think they wait for you to jump.

1024
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,920
I don't think it's every 7 seconds.

1025
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:01,480
I think they wait for you to jump and then just intercept you.

1026
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,980
It's so rude!

1027
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,860
I think they wait for you to like do an action.

1028
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,140
Oh!

1029
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,260
It's not that one.

1030
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,140
Ugh!

1031
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:18,190
Hey!

1032
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:29,500
Oh!

1033
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,780
I don't know which one.

1034
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:38,720
I don't know!

1035
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,780
This game is 100% designed to be rude.

1036
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:44,960
I agree.

1037
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:46,680
Ah!

1038
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,900
I don't think I got... I don't think I got...

1039
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:50,900
I don't think I got it.

1040
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,720
I don't think it was this far that I made it.

1041
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,820
Oh my gosh!

1042
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,580
Fish, fish, fish, fish.

1043
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,260
Six, seven!

1044
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,560
You know what, let's just keep going then.

1045
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:23,960
One, two, three, four, five...

1046
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,560
Oh, oh yeah!

1047
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,820
Sorry, I pressed the wrong button.

1048
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,800
Was it worth it?

1049
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,120
Okay, we're gonna find it now.

1050
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,440
It wasn't this one.

1051
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,860
It was... not that one.

1052
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,260
This one!

1053
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:46,880
No.

1054
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,680
Maybe it was...

1055
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,800
Maybe it was the one after that.

1056
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,700
Maybe this one.

1057
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:10,700
Wait.

1058
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:14,960
This one?

1059
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,820
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

1060
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,360
Six zone!

1061
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:20,900
Six zone!

1062
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,320
Oh my god.

1063
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:28,820
I got an item!

1064
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,140
I got shoes!

1065
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:31,760
I got shoes!

1066
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,720
Oh no, wait.

1067
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,780
This one was really hard.

1068
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:38,960
No.

1069
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:52,260
You know what, it's fine because we wasted some lives on level three, so it's whatever.

1070
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,840
Don't worry about it.

1071
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,220
We wasted some lives on level three, so...

1072
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:00,220
Okay, we gotta get to level three without dying.

1073
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,980
Oh my gosh.

1074
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,360
Oh my god.

1075
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,680
No, no, no.

1076
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:09,790
Okay.

1077
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:13,010
Oh.

1078
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:14,490
Oh.

1079
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:16,250
Thanks, VeraLint.

1080
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,200
Is this Takeshi's challenge?

1081
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,220
I think it's on par.

1082
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,160
I think it's on par.

1083
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,820
Ta-da.

1084
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,380
Oh, ba-da-da-ba.

1085
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:41,640
Second zone!

1086
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,120
This jeopardizes your goal.

1087
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:46,680
It's okay.

1088
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:48,920
It's okay.

1089
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:52,840
It's okay.

1090
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,460
This one's easy.

1091
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,960
There's no pitfalls.

1092
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,440
Just gotta avoid these guys.

1093
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,920
Why am I so weak?

1094
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,740
I can't even handle a hermit crab.

1095
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:07,860
Oh my god.

1096
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,600
How did I live that?

1097
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,640
How did I live that?

1098
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,620
What is this?

1099
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,300
Atlantis is so mysterious.

1100
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,320
Truly.

1101
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,180
The most mysterious place.

1102
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:24,760
Okay.

1103
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:25,840
Third zone.

1104
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,540
Have you seen the size of those hermit crabs?

1105
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:30,460
Still.

1106
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,440
They're really cool, too.

1107
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,460
Like, they're wearing their sunglasses and...

1108
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:34,900
Okay.

1109
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,600
Now I have to find this one.

1110
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,020
I like this.

1111
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,140
I personally like the mint center CX arrow we've got.

1112
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,020
I don't mind.

1113
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,120
Like, I think...

1114
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,940
Some people are just like I hate playing rage games.

1115
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,420
Because, you know, they're designed to make you rage.

1116
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,280
But I personally am like a fan of...

1117
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,860
Being like...

1118
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:10,760
Of...

1119
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,880
Hopefully beating them.

1120
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:13,680
Oh my god!

1121
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:13,920
No!

1122
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:17,720
Okay.

1123
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:17,780
Okay.

1124
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,080
We have three lives.

1125
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:32,290
Like, I think it's like the best feeling in the world to clear something that is meant to be so frustrating.

1126
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:36,230
Okay, it was one...

1127
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:38,450
I see the fish!

1128
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:41,510
I see the fish and my finger still says, A!

1129
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:48,850
You know what?

1130
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:49,690
I think I'm just gonna die.

1131
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:50,770
Actually, no.

1132
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:52,790
I'm not.

1133
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:56,990
I will continue on.

1134
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:00,950
I will continue onward.

1135
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:07,010
When the going gets tough, you'll pull through like you always do.

1136
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:08,410
Thank you!

1137
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:11,190
Okay.

1138
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,560
It was...

1139
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,460
This one!

1140
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:18,700
Yes!

1141
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:25,570
Oh my god, please, please!

1142
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:27,470
Nice!

1143
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:30,710
Okay, eighth zone!

1144
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:32,710
Alright, alright, alright.

1145
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:34,030
Alright, alright.

1146
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:36,650
I wonder what the... the boosts don't make me faster or anything.

1147
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:37,310
I don't...

1148
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:39,490
think.

1149
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:42,790
I hope not.

1150
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:45,610
Please, god, don't give me more speed in this game.

1151
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:46,630
I will continue.

1152
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:46,930
I will cry.

1153
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:48,370
I will...

1154
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:49,330
I will cry.

1155
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:54,150
If I have to go any further or faster than I have...

1156
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:56,290
Please, actually, just give me...

1157
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:56,890
Like...

1158
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:58,930
Just stop the momentum.

1159
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,510
That would be the better gift.

1160
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:01,250
Truly.

1161
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:09,550
When they like start coming back to life, these little hermit crabs, it's like two seconds that they give you a warning.

1162
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:10,330
It's crazy.

1163
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:11,890
Okay.

1164
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:14,350
Momentum.

1165
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:18,590
I felt so close.

1166
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,250
Momentum.

1167
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:22,330
Momentum.

1168
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,140
Okay.

1169
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,580
That was so close!

1170
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,500
Okay, okay, okay.

1171
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,080
I think I can just drop there.

1172
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:41,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1173
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,320
Okay.

1174
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,540
Okay.

1175
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:44,580
Sorry.

1176
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,680
Oh my god, I'm so stressed.

1177
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,840
Okay, treasure chest.

1178
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:50,900
Okay.

1179
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,400
Nice.

1180
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,500
The time limit!

1181
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,820
It's so brutal!

1182
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,680
You would think that 900 seconds is a lot.

1183
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,980
Even Mario gives you like a thousand, doesn't...

1184
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:19,340
Don't they?

1185
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:28,350
Sometimes I gotta take my time.

1186
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:30,610
Not in...

1187
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:32,290
No, there's no time in Atlantis.

1188
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:34,370
Oh!

1189
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:37,180
Oh!

1190
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:38,340
Oh my god!

1191
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,160
Oh my gosh, that was so close.

1192
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:42,800
Let's wait for this guy to go down.

1193
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:43,360
Yep.

1194
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:43,940
There we go.

1195
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,460
Okay, here.

1196
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:47,640
Okay.

1197
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:48,720
Okay.

1198
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,100
Oh!

1199
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:56,640
Okay.

1200
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:57,740
Oh!

1201
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:58,980
Oh!

1202
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:11,760
Pain!

1203
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:23,900
You know what?

1204
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,440
Let's say 1%.

1205
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,320
We're at...

1206
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:29,600
We're at...

1207
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,180
We're at 1%.

1208
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:30,780
Oh, wow.

1209
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:31,520
What's this level?

1210
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,500
It's funny because I can't...

1211
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,880
I can like kind of control this guy.

1212
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,620
Like, I can jump, but I...

1213
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:38,020
I can't throw anything.

1214
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,980
And also, I didn't make that jump either.

1215
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,200
I don't...

1216
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,120
I don't understand.

1217
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,000
Wait!

1218
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:43,380
Wait!

1219
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,400
Oh, I ended up dying.

1220
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:48,640
Okay, let's go.

1221
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,900
There's no better way than I'd want to spend my Saturday.

1222
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,960
Okay, let's go.

1223
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:00,800
Okay, let's go.

1224
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:00,820
Okay, let's go.

1225
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:10,040
No better way than I'd want to spend my Saturday, traveling...

1226
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,920
Okay, I said 900 seconds.

1227
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,500
These are way faster than seconds.

1228
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,160
Oh!

1229
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:23,980
No better way than spend my Saturday, just put 2% now.

1230
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,760
I'm dying on purpose, by the way, so that we can just...

1231
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,800
I wonder if there's a way for me to just read this.

1232
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,120
Reset.

1233
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,320
I don't think so.

1234
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,780
Just let me...

1235
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,000
Just let me die already.

1236
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:43,280
No better way than to spend my Saturday.

1237
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,060
When I'm trying to die, the deaths feel so...

1238
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:56,320
Oh wait.

1239
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,140
I instinctively just jumped over.

1240
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:07,520
You could be watching an idol live and here you are.

1241
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:08,620
Where are you going?

1242
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,760
Where would I be watching an IdleLive?

1243
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:12,980
I'm not in Japan.

1244
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,000
Hello.

1245
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:39,650
Stage 2.

1246
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:43,530
You could be watching IdleLive a lot on YouTube.

1247
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:46,330
So true.

1248
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:55,790
Actually, it's like so frustrating sometimes being for an Idle fan because like they film shows.

1249
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:57,710
I know they do.

1250
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:02,590
I see the cameras in the back, but they don't post them like 99% of the time.

1251
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:04,570
They never post the show itself.

1252
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:07,610
So if I miss a show, like that's kind of it.

1253
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:11,410
And sometimes they'll perform like a special set list.

1254
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:16,250
It's mostly frustrating for birthdays because they'll perform like a special set list.

1255
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:17,690
And I'm like, no, please.

1256
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:22,110
Please, I just want to see you perform this song.

1257
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:27,230
I think it is for them to like watch back and practice and like, you know...

1258
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:33,930
See like where maybe they made mistakes or certain parts.

1259
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:37,270
But like it's still so... it's just so sad.

1260
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:40,330
Okay, I'm waiting for fish.

1261
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,040
Okay, it was the third one.

1262
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:47,320
Here.

1263
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:19,570
Fish.

1264
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:24,250
Fish.

1265
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:29,770
Fish.

1266
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,950
Okay.

1267
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:37,350
This one.

1268
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:39,710
Six zone!

1269
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:41,350
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1270
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:46,310
Oh my gosh.

1271
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:46,710
Sorry.

1272
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,710
It came out of nowhere.

1273
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:50,590
Okay.

1274
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:52,190
Gotta go fast.

1275
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:58,490
Okay, this is not very fast.

1276
01:02:58,770 --> 01:02:59,470
Gotta go fast.

1277
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:00,150
Phew.

1278
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:01,290
Phew.

1279
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:02,110
Phew.

1280
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:02,390
Phew.

1281
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:04,550
Phew.

1282
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:05,190
Phew.

1283
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:05,790
Phew.

1284
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:05,950
Phew.

1285
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:06,710
Yeah.

1286
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:08,930
Faster!

1287
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:09,630
Faster!

1288
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:10,950
Nasal man!

1289
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:13,810
Please!

1290
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:14,550
Faster!

1291
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:15,110
Faster!

1292
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:20,070
Just... ride like you're... you little legs.

1293
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,730
It was a ride, just ride!

1294
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:23,630
Oh my god!

1295
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:25,210
Nice.

1296
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:26,070
Okay.

1297
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:26,170
Okay.

1298
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:27,330
Oh!

1299
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:28,270
Nice, nice, nice.

1300
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:28,570
Okay.

1301
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:30,970
This part is tricky, but we got this.

1302
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:32,750
Oh gosh, oh gosh, I don't have this.

1303
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:35,910
Okay.

1304
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,880
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

1305
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,160
Please.

1306
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:45,800
You know what?

1307
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:46,280
Screw it.

1308
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:50,480
I don't have-

1309
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:05,350
We're fine.

1310
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:06,370
Oh my god.

1311
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:07,830
Where did you come from?!

1312
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:12,330
I even threw the bomb and it didn't even affect him!

1313
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:16,710
Just run.

1314
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:18,210
Run and jump.

1315
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:28,820
Oh my god.

1316
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:29,620
Oh my god.

1317
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:30,440
Oh my god.

1318
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,400
Okay.

1319
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,140
No!

1320
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:45,030
Oh my god.

1321
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:45,670
Oh my god.

1322
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:46,010
Oh!

1323
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:48,410
I think actually that did stop him.

1324
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:54,830
I don't know why this stage gives me so much trouble.

1325
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:57,090
It's so much hopping.

1326
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:13,770
Oh no, and he's right there.

1327
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:15,270
Okay.

1328
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,400
Momentum.

1329
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,300
Don't forget the basics of CQC boss or something.

1330
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,900
Yeah, thanks.

1331
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,220
Oh, the momentum.

1332
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:31,480
Oh, the momentum.

1333
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:36,580
That wasn't even me over-correcting at that time.

1334
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,260
Okay, just in case.

1335
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,440
Sometimes I die.

1336
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,380
Sometimes I don't.

1337
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:45,840
The game's...

1338
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,660
The game doesn't even know...

1339
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:49,840
I don't know what my own hitbox is.

1340
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:51,140
I have no idea.

1341
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,360
I have no idea.

1342
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:22,000
You guys, I don't think we're making it to level 9, so...

1343
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:25,700
You aren't playing through OBS, are you?

1344
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:27,220
No, I'm actually not!

1345
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:30,200
I'm actually not playing through OBS.

1346
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,480
It's only been an hour!

1347
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:56,850
Maybe try with OBS.

1348
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:01,430
Maybe I'm too used to OBS now.

1349
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,820
Where did the other door in here take me?

1350
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:08,500
I can't remember.

1351
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:11,580
Just run!

1352
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,680
Just run and jump!

1353
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,400
There we go.

1354
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:24,570
Oh gosh, there's so many tiny little holes!

1355
01:07:25,530 --> 01:07:27,150
Oh, I thought I was gonna die there!

1356
01:07:27,530 --> 01:07:29,430
I thought for sure I would die there!

1357
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:30,990
Okay, third zone.

1358
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:32,270
No fish!

1359
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:33,010
No fish!

1360
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:33,610
No fish!

1361
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:34,870
No fish!

1362
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:35,610
No fish!

1363
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:36,710
No fish!

1364
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:36,790
No fish!

1365
01:07:36,790 --> 01:07:38,310
Sorry, I'm allergic...

1366
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:40,550
...to fish.

1367
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:41,290
Okay.

1368
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:42,570
Fish.

1369
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:49,090
Fish!

1370
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:53,850
Here.

1371
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:55,590
Nice!

1372
01:07:58,190 --> 01:07:59,170
Nice, nice, nice.

1373
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:01,550
Oh, shoot.

1374
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:02,070
I forgot.

1375
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:05,650
Why is everything pooping on me?

1376
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:06,470
Okay.

1377
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:10,280
Ah, please!

1378
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,500
Okay, okay, okay.

1379
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:16,040
Let's go!

1380
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,740
I thought I was gonna land on top of that other one, so...

1381
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:30,960
Okay.

1382
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,500
The music in this, I think, stresses me out.

1383
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:37,400
It's so fast-paced, you know?

1384
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,060
Oh my god, I thought I was gonna die!

1385
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,920
Oh, I thought I was gonna die!

1386
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,560
Big leaps.

1387
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:47,600
Oh my god.

1388
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:48,440
Okay.

1389
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,080
Okay, alright.

1390
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,320
Very good.

1391
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,520
Okay, nothing here.

1392
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:56,720
Nothing here.

1393
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:58,660
Okay.

1394
01:08:58,660 --> 01:08:59,280
Shoo!

1395
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:00,100
Shoo!

1396
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:00,680
Shoo!

1397
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:01,520
Shoo!

1398
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:03,500
Shoo!

1399
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:05,340
Shoo!

1400
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,240
Shoo!

1401
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:06,340
Shoo!

1402
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:06,460
Shoo!

1403
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:06,740
Gah!

1404
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,920
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!

1405
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:08,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1406
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,520
I have to wait...

1407
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:20,730
I jumped, but I... didn't.

1408
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:22,990
Maybe do it soon enough.

1409
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:26,370
Oh...

1410
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:29,350
Come on, come on, come on!

1411
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,370
There's no time to lose!

1412
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:34,190
Oh my god.

1413
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:37,310
Why wasn't he affected by the bomb?

1414
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:42,050
Why wasn't he affected by the bomb?

1415
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:03,440
Sometimes it really doesn't read my inputs, but that's okay.

1416
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:06,920
Like there, I tried jumping just then.

1417
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:08,140
Might be my controller.

1418
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,340
No, no.

1419
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,720
It's just a skill issue.

1420
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:12,640
Real gamers don't blame the controller.

1421
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:18,970
I'm a gamer.

1422
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:20,370
I'm a gamer.

1423
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:22,750
Yeah, we do.

1424
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:25,750
Actually, maybe that's the most gamer thing to do.

1425
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:27,190
Is to blame the controller.

1426
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:32,200
Why?

1427
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,020
There we go.

1428
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:40,540
Please.

1429
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:41,080
Please.

1430
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:42,180
Thank you.

1431
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:46,730
Okay.

1432
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:48,090
We made it to the treasure chest.

1433
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:49,810
Okay, just don't even try.

1434
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:50,390
Just go.

1435
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:51,590
Just go.

1436
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:52,250
Just go.

1437
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:55,820
Please.

1438
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,920
Please just make it to the door.

1439
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,760
Oh my god.

1440
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,180
Tenth zone.

1441
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,100
Oh, tenth zone.

1442
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,360
Okay.

1443
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,200
Clouds.

1444
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:19,070
Oh my gosh.

1445
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:22,570
No, I missed the star.

1446
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:24,330
Uh oh.

1447
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:26,410
It's Jover.

1448
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:31,130
It's Jover, you guys.

1449
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:31,690
I missed the...

1450
01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:34,050
I missed the...

1451
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:35,610
I missed it.

1452
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:40,330
Maybe there will be another one.

1453
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:43,510
Maybe there will be another one.

1454
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:51,250
That was bad.

1455
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:53,950
Oh wait, we got another chance.

1456
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:54,730
We got another chance.

1457
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:56,970
Hi...

1458
01:11:58,310 --> 01:11:58,770
Hi.

1459
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:00,530
Hi.

1460
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:02,090
Hi...

1461
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:06,250
I was too...

1462
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:09,650
I got it!

1463
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:10,150
I got it!

1464
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:10,670
I got it!

1465
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:12,150
I got...

1466
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:16,690
Oh my god.

1467
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:17,270
Oh my god.

1468
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:27,560
Phew...

1469
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:47,800
That was from here, right?

1470
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:49,420
Yes.

1471
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:58,500
No, no, no, no, no!

1472
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:58,900
Okay, okay.

1473
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,360
This is the most stressful level.

1474
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:16,320
Oh my god, this is the most stressful level I've ever played in my entire afterlife.

1475
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:17,700
Oh my god.

1476
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,440
Oh my god, you guys.

1477
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,140
I can barely breathe.

1478
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,700
I can barely breathe.

1479
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:25,740
Oh my gosh, I can barely breathe.

1480
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:32,460
You're struggling.

1481
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,220
You're stressing me out.

1482
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,040
What am I doing?

1483
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:35,780
It's the game!

1484
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,700
Oh my god.

1485
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:03,660
Okay, okay.

1486
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:09,180
I think this level wouldn't be as bad if I didn't have to go through level 8 before.

1487
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:09,420
I think this level wouldn't be as bad if I didn't have to go through level 8 before.

1488
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,180
Oh no!

1489
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,600
If I didn't have to go through level 8 before...

1490
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:16,440
I would have...

1491
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,380
Called it, man.

1492
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:47,840
Hey.

1493
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,340
You guys...

1494
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,560
That's why I don't have a death counter.

1495
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:53,940
Because...

1496
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:54,900
No way.

1497
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:57,700
It's...

1498
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:58,520
When...

1499
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:01,460
When someone way better at games than me...

1500
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:04,880
Takes three hours on one stage, I think...

1501
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,700
I think we, uh...

1502
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:08,360
Uh, you know what?

1503
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:08,980
I'm gonna go up.

1504
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:13,110
I think we can...

1505
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:17,130
Recognize the trouble we are in.

1506
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:19,270
Recognize the trouble we are in.

1507
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:20,370
And I have to get it eventually.

1508
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:24,410
I have to get it eventually.

1509
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:27,350
It has to come eventually.

1510
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:29,890
Death count, yes.

1511
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:32,230
Pretty much.

1512
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:34,330
Okay, fish.

1513
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:38,170
Fish.

1514
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:40,990
Oh, that was close.

1515
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:46,550
Okay.

1516
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:48,010
Here.

1517
01:15:48,770 --> 01:15:50,090
Six zone.

1518
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:51,410
Okay.

1519
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:57,220
Nice!

1520
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:04,060
Level 8.

1521
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:05,820
My...

1522
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,920
The pain of my existence level 8.

1523
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:14,860
Because it's so long!

1524
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,720
It's also like so...

1525
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:17,740
Oh my god.

1526
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,160
It's also so long.

1527
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,500
It takes so long to get through it.

1528
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,360
Maybe it's just me.

1529
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:30,140
Maybe, you know what?

1530
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,760
Looking at it, it's actually not that long.

1531
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:32,920
I think it's just me.

1532
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:34,660
Okay.

1533
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:44,720
I ran and jumped!

1534
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:45,800
I ran and jumped!

1535
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:49,140
I ran and I jumped!

1536
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,720
And I still only did a tiny jump.

1537
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:52,900
But...

1538
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:54,360
Oh...

1539
01:16:58,610 --> 01:17:00,370
That could have been close.

1540
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:01,210
But...

1541
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:14,800
Come on!

1542
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:15,280
Come on!

1543
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:15,360
Come on!

1544
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:15,500
Come on!

1545
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:15,860
Come on!

1546
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:30,840
Be careful!

1547
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,460
I didn't do anything there!

1548
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,120
Come on!

1549
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:34,280
I didn't do anything there!

1550
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,680
I didn't even do anything there!

1551
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:38,360
I just...

1552
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:38,980
I just...

1553
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:40,220
I just jumped...

1554
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:42,420
And the guy ran and decided to run on its own!

1555
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:48,490
I threw my bomb too late.

1556
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:54,790
Look on the bright side.

1557
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:57,150
You could be playing a harder NES game.

1558
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:10,930
Look on the bright side.

1559
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:12,110
This game is easy!

1560
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:17,490
Look on the bright side.

1561
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:19,570
This game... a baby could do it.

1562
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:23,630
Thank you.

1563
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:24,490
You know what...

1564
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:31,310
Always look on the bright side.

1565
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:36,770
I don't know why sometimes I die...

1566
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:39,230
to the bombs and sometimes I don't.

1567
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:51,720
I think if I jump, I don't die to the bomb.

1568
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:53,400
Maybe.

1569
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:55,780
Thanks for the super chat!

1570
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:56,520
I'll read it.

1571
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:58,200
Is there a reason for... oh wait.

1572
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,040
Insane timer?

1573
01:18:59,220 --> 01:18:59,980
I have no idea.

1574
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,800
Because this game, I think, was designed to...

1575
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:05,040
literally hate you.

1576
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,240
It's designed to make you...

1577
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:08,540
so sad.

1578
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:14,160
It's designed to make you really, really sad.

1579
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:15,260
Please.

1580
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:16,060
Please.

1581
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:16,400
Okay.

1582
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,440
There we go.

1583
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,120
Okay.

1584
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:22,120
It's designed to make you cry.

1585
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,500
We're so close.

1586
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:37,640
Gaming.

1587
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:38,460
Okay.

1588
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,320
We have only three lives left.

1589
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:43,580
Thank you Kyoki!

1590
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:59,500
I feel like I'm at least getting better at the previous level though, so...

1591
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,280
Okay.

1592
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:03,800
Got the star.

1593
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:05,660
Oh my god!

1594
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:06,040
No!

1595
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:09,640
Jump is so tricky!

1596
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,200
One life left, everybody.

1597
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,440
What if I go backwards?

1598
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:14,220
What if I go this way?

1599
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:16,400
Nevermind!

1600
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:27,230
No!

1601
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:40,860
Jump...

1602
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:43,580
And jump!

1603
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:45,100
Poop.

1604
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:46,720
Door.

1605
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,460
You earned that game over.

1606
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,380
Yeah, I did.

1607
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:52,080
What was she cooking?

1608
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,040
Look, I have one life left.

1609
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:55,500
What am I gonna do?

1610
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:57,300
Experiment when I have...

1611
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,140
When I have 50 lives?

1612
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:03,680
This game needs to give you 50 lives, speaking of.

1613
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:05,480
The life...

1614
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,760
They need to give you more lives in this game.

1615
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:20,060
Oh my gosh.

1616
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:20,440
Wait.

1617
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:21,360
Oh my god.

1618
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,360
I didn't think I would make that.

1619
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:24,820
I didn't think I would make that at all.

1620
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:28,080
Okay.

1621
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,080
There are cheats that let you add lives?

1622
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:31,720
No way!

1623
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:32,120
Really?

1624
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:39,400
This one I can take a little bit slower because...

1625
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:41,900
Oh my gosh.

1626
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:45,220
Because it's right like here that way.

1627
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:47,580
Fish.

1628
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,940
It's right here.

1629
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,740
You're just holding back on how good you are to make us feel better?

1630
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,060
I... I...

1631
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:00,860
I encourage you.

1632
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:01,500
Play this game.

1633
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:02,720
Play it.

1634
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:05,680
Play it.

1635
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:07,900
I encourage you.

1636
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,180
I'm not looking to beat any records.

1637
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,140
Oh my god.

1638
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:19,980
No!

1639
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:30,120
That was so dirty.

1640
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:32,260
That was so dirty.

1641
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:38,900
Oh my gosh.

1642
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,460
That was so dirty.

1643
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:41,640
But no.

1644
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:42,440
Actually play it.

1645
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:42,860
Try it.

1646
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,800
I'm not trying to beat any records here.

1647
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,020
But just to give you an idea.

1648
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:52,300
Korone-san...

1649
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:54,540
Took...

1650
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,720
About 12 hours.

1651
01:22:58,800 --> 01:22:59,400
And...

1652
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,840
And Game Center CX...

1653
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:03,300
Between two people...

1654
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:04,720
Arino took about...

1655
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:05,920
Eight and a half...

1656
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:06,400
Eight hours?

1657
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,120
Eight and a half hours?

1658
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:11,120
So...

1659
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,100
What is the speedrun on this game?

1660
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:13,480
What?

1661
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:15,280
What is the...

1662
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,400
What is the speedrun on this game?

1663
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,180
I don't even want to know actually.

1664
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:20,440
I think I'll throw up.

1665
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:21,720
Wait.

1666
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:23,880
Uh oh.

1667
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,220
I'm losing a lot of time.

1668
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:26,120
Oh gosh.

1669
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:27,340
Okay.

1670
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:29,500
I have to be quicker with these.

1671
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:30,920
Okay.

1672
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:33,000
No.

1673
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:34,080
Oh gosh.

1674
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:34,740
I gotta be fast.

1675
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:35,340
I gotta be fast.

1676
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:36,000
No!

1677
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,320
Three minutes?

1678
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:40,640
Oh.

1679
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:41,680
For task run though?

1680
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:42,180
Come on.

1681
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:42,860
That doesn't count.

1682
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,620
Task run doesn't count.

1683
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:49,000
I mean for real people.

1684
01:24:04,050 --> 01:24:05,190
I'll look in a second.

1685
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:06,050
I'm concentrating.

1686
01:24:07,730 --> 01:24:08,570
I'm concentrating.

1687
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:11,610
Holy cow.

1688
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:13,030
How did I make that?

1689
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:16,730
I think it's just mint.

1690
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:17,790
Just mint gaming.

1691
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:19,630
Oh my gosh.

1692
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:19,890
Please.

1693
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:20,950
I need to make this...

1694
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:21,750
Why?

1695
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:23,110
Please sir.

1696
01:24:23,810 --> 01:24:24,490
There we go.

1697
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:25,690
Okay.

1698
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:27,350
Okay.

1699
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:31,500
There we go.

1700
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:32,400
Okay.

1701
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,880
Here is the tough one.

1702
01:24:38,910 --> 01:24:39,630
I think...

1703
01:24:39,630 --> 01:24:41,090
I don't think 225 is task?

1704
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:42,210
Really?

1705
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:43,950
No way.

1706
01:24:44,930 --> 01:24:45,690
No way.

1707
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:52,880
I need this guy to run.

1708
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,260
I had to stop falling from the ceiling.

1709
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,240
He's scaring me.

1710
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,180
He's stressing me out a little bit.

1711
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:14,580
Nooo... Why you gotta be down there?

1712
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:23,760
Wait...

1713
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:25,420
Okay...

1714
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:26,520
Okay...

1715
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:26,800
Okay...

1716
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:28,420
Okay, here...

1717
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:31,180
Here's where I really mess up, so...

1718
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:32,340
Okay, there we go.

1719
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:33,980
Nice, nice, nice hoop!

1720
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:35,680
I think I have time!

1721
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:38,880
But I'm not gonna risk it!

1722
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:40,620
Just go!

1723
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,180
Don't risk it for the biscuit!

1724
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,100
It's not worth it!

1725
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:43,960
It's not even delicious!

1726
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:44,600
It's dry!

1727
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:47,080
Don't risk it for the biscuit!

1728
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:48,200
Okay...

1729
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:50,660
Okay...

1730
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,660
Oh, hold on...

1731
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:54,880
Hold on...

1732
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,080
Hold on...

1733
01:25:58,040 --> 01:25:58,620
Goodbye...

1734
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:06,950
Where are the mods?

1735
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:08,430
Okay...

1736
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:12,830
Hey...

1737
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:14,510
Hey...

1738
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:17,370
They're probably... They're probably just like, We can't watch this anymore.

1739
01:26:18,810 --> 01:26:19,610
This is...

1740
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:22,170
This is too stressful.

1741
01:26:23,130 --> 01:26:25,390
This is too stressful on my little heart!

1742
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,440
How did I make that?

1743
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:46,140
Oh my gosh, please, please, please...

1744
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:48,180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

1745
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,900
Oh, the timer is just going!

1746
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:51,800
It's just going!

1747
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:07,850
Oh, that was a pretty good run, though.

1748
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:08,710
That was a pretty good run.

1749
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:10,450
That was a pretty good run.

1750
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:12,230
All things...

1751
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:14,550
All things considered...

1752
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:21,110
You...

1753
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:25,890
You...

1754
01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:27,190
You...

1755
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:28,410
You...

1756
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,810
Oh, well, I didn't make it anyway.

1757
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:32,590
Oh, gosh...

1758
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:33,810
You're getting better.

1759
01:27:34,210 --> 01:27:34,890
I don't think...

1760
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:36,730
I don't think there's a way to get better at this game.

1761
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:37,470
I'll be honest.

1762
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:40,250
I think this game is just so...

1763
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:41,510
So evil.

1764
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:44,110
This game is not meant to...

1765
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:46,050
You're not supposed to get better at this game.

1766
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:47,210
I don't think...

1767
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:48,390
I think...

1768
01:27:53,610 --> 01:27:55,970
I don't know how much skill comes into this.

1769
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:56,750
That's what I'm saying!

1770
01:27:59,870 --> 01:28:00,910
I have to like...

1771
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:03,570
At least with this one, I feel like I have to memorize...

1772
01:28:04,890 --> 01:28:05,530
Why?

1773
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:10,210
I have to memorize how...

1774
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:12,330
Where I stand...

1775
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:13,850
The standing placement and...

1776
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:16,990
How much I press down on the button...

1777
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:18,070
And everything!

1778
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:19,950
I have to memorize so much!

1779
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:24,410
Sorry, I totally...

1780
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:34,480
Game was made by a sadist.

1781
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:41,400
I'm gonna start up my...

1782
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:42,320
I'm gonna...

1783
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:43,280
I got a coffee.

1784
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:45,580
It might not actually be good for me to have this...

1785
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:47,280
Because it'll make my hands shaky, but...

1786
01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:56,450
I'm okay.

1787
01:29:04,230 --> 01:29:04,630
Yummy!

1788
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:14,790
Rage back down to zero!

1789
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:18,570
Yummy, yummy!

1790
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:21,410
You're lucky stars.

1791
01:29:21,470 --> 01:29:22,990
This isn't super pitfall.

1792
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:24,490
You'd be mentally barfing.

1793
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:31,670
You wanna take that back?

1794
01:29:34,030 --> 01:29:35,690
You wanna take that back?

1795
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:57,540
Actually...

1796
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:58,620
Hold on.

1797
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:00,480
I'm gonna die.

1798
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:04,280
Because I do wanna see how far I can...

1799
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:04,600
Um...

1800
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:05,440
Okay, hold on.

1801
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:09,400
Okay, hold on.

1802
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,640
Let's get to the level 54 again.

1803
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:14,600
I wanna go that route.

1804
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:18,640
Because I'm pretty sure that there's another warp there.

1805
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:19,640
Because...

1806
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:22,960
From what I remember, there's a way to get all the way to level 99.

1807
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:25,460
But...

1808
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:26,500
So...

1809
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:27,740
Sorry.

1810
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:29,540
Maybe I should have done this before I...

1811
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:30,860
No, no.

1812
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:32,200
We're not gonna go through the rave room.

1813
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:33,340
I think you can skip it.

1814
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:34,780
I'm gonna...

1815
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:36,940
I'm gonna check the guide real quick once we're done.

1816
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:38,280
Yeah, there's a hidden door.

1817
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:38,860
Okay, okay.

1818
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:39,320
I thought so.

1819
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:39,820
I thought so.

1820
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:41,040
I thought so.

1821
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:41,500
I thought so.

1822
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:42,360
So we're gonna...

1823
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:43,880
We're gonna die.

1824
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:46,120
And we're gonna...

1825
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:47,420
Because I do wanna see...

1826
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:50,980
I mean, if I can just beat the game by getting to level 99...

1827
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,160
Okay.

1828
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:56,800
Was that my last one?

1829
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:58,360
Yeah.

1830
01:30:58,460 --> 01:30:58,760
Okay.

1831
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:00,560
Strategy guide.

1832
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:01,100
Okay.

1833
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:01,920
Let me see now.

1834
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:04,600
Okay.

1835
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:05,840
Here.

1836
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:08,320
So...

1837
01:31:13,370 --> 01:31:13,890
11.

1838
01:31:14,270 --> 01:31:14,990
This is...

1839
01:31:14,990 --> 01:31:15,790
Wait, is that where we...

1840
01:31:15,790 --> 01:31:15,850
No.

1841
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:16,690
11...

1842
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:17,830
52.

1843
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:18,930
Yes, yes, yes.

1844
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:19,770
91?

1845
01:31:20,230 --> 01:31:21,330
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1846
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:23,270
So 1 to 11.

1847
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:32,000
Okay.

1848
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:33,880
Okay.

1849
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:46,000
It doesn't say how I get to level 91.

1850
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:47,520
Hmm.

1851
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:51,940
What the hell is this map?

1852
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:54,440
This is the levels for this game!

1853
01:31:56,980 --> 01:31:58,620
This is the levels for this game!

1854
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,180
So you can go 1, 2, 3, 4...

1855
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:04,100
Wait, you can't even go from 4 to 5?

1856
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:05,500
What is it?

1857
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:05,900
Wait...

1858
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:07,400
Where is level 5?

1859
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,040
There... there is... huh?

1860
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:20,480
Oh, it's... Oh, I see it!

1861
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:21,000
It's below 2.

1862
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:21,260
Okay.

1863
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:22,320
5...

1864
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,380
Can also get you to 24...

1865
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,300
But how do you get 4 to 5?

1866
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:28,760
What the heck is happening?

1867
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:31,240
5 to 6?

1868
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:33,000
6...

1869
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,540
And then 6 to 7...

1870
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:40,480
No, 6 can go to 8 and 9... Oh, you can go...

1871
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:41,420
Wait, huh?

1872
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:47,360
But we're gonna go to 11...

1873
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:49,980
And then we're gonna go to 52...

1874
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:55,840
I can't read that...

1875
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:57,480
Jimetsuwapu...

1876
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:00,900
And then you can go to zone 91...

1877
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,160
But what's the warp?

1878
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,520
The 91 to 95...

1879
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:09,200
To 93?

1880
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:10,700
96?

1881
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:13,840
Yeah, we can... we can get the final... Oh...

1882
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:14,960
Oops...

1883
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,820
We can get there, maybe...

1884
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:21,680
11 is the highway...

1885
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:24,540
I see... I get it...

1886
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:26,960
What about 20 to 100?

1887
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:32,240
Yeah, how do we... Okay, 9, 8, 20...

1888
01:33:34,820 --> 01:33:35,340
Right?

1889
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:36,540
Wait, okay, hold on...

1890
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:37,040
Oh...

1891
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:43,400
So 9 to 8 to 20... Wait, 9 to 8...

1892
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,940
To 20 to 100...

1893
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:49,360
That's a plausible... possible path...

1894
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,320
Yeah, let's try it out...

1895
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:53,420
Sorry, I keep clicking on the wrong thing...

1896
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:53,680
Okay...

1897
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:55,600
There we go... Okay...

1898
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,840
It was from 2, right?

1899
01:33:58,060 --> 01:33:59,700
2, 9, 8, 20...

1900
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:05,540
Oh,

1901
01:34:17,330 --> 01:34:18,070
2, 2, 2...

1902
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:19,910
Wait, okay, 2 to a...

1903
01:34:19,910 --> 01:34:22,110
That's probably the one where we run...

1904
01:34:22,110 --> 01:34:24,210
Past this door here...

1905
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,400
So let's just stay down...

1906
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:30,880
Stay down...

1907
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:33,920
We'll stay down...

1908
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:37,160
Oh my god... Oh, that was close...

1909
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:37,900
Phew...

1910
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:41,280
That was so close...

1911
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:44,620
Run past you...

1912
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:48,300
Da da da...

1913
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:49,580
Da da da...

1914
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:49,800
Da da da...

1915
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,120
Da da da...

1916
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:52,440
Da da da...

1917
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,140
Okay, run past you...

1918
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:58,560
I don't remember where the door is...

1919
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,500
Oh, that's so unfair...

1920
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:03,380
They're on top of the treasure box...

1921
01:35:06,190 --> 01:35:08,060
I don't have much time though...

1922
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:09,200
So I gotta zip...

1923
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,860
I gotta zippity...

1924
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:12,200
Okay, never mind...

1925
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:14,000
Door...

1926
01:35:15,150 --> 01:35:16,780
Did someone say...

1927
01:35:17,130 --> 01:35:18,240
The door...

1928
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:20,080
To darkness?

1929
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,140
Okay, 9th zone...

1930
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:25,700
Wait, was this right?

1931
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:32,390
Was this correct?

1932
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:37,290
I think this gives me an extra life...

1933
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:39,650
From 9 to 8...

1934
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:40,510
Oh, that's right, yes...

1935
01:35:40,510 --> 01:35:42,170
And then we went back to 8...

1936
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:42,850
Yes, yes, yes...

1937
01:35:42,850 --> 01:35:44,290
And then 8 to 20...

1938
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:45,310
Wait...

1939
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:46,590
Oh, no...

1940
01:35:46,590 --> 01:35:47,670
Oh, no...

1941
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:48,810
Wait...

1942
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:50,250
There's a...

1943
01:35:52,050 --> 01:35:52,530
Oh...

1944
01:35:52,530 --> 01:35:52,670
Oh...

1945
01:35:52,670 --> 01:35:53,130
Oh...

1946
01:35:53,130 --> 01:35:53,630
Oh...

1947
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:54,770
Oh, god...

1948
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:55,150
Oh...

1949
01:35:55,910 --> 01:35:56,390
Okay...

1950
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:56,790
Oh...

1951
01:35:58,810 --> 01:36:01,510
For some reason, my brain did not comprehend that...

1952
01:36:01,510 --> 01:36:01,910
Okay...

1953
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:04,810
Let's look for any places like...

1954
01:36:06,070 --> 01:36:07,430
That a door...

1955
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:09,050
Like, I feel like in here...

1956
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:09,630
You know, like...

1957
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:11,750
In a little dip at the bottom...

1958
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:12,090
Like a...

1959
01:36:12,790 --> 01:36:13,750
A door...

1960
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:14,290
Oh, wait...

1961
01:36:14,290 --> 01:36:15,930
Unless I run past...

1962
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:17,210
Oh, shoot...

1963
01:36:17,210 --> 01:36:19,090
Wait, I already messed up then at that point...

1964
01:36:19,450 --> 01:36:20,490
I've already messed up...

1965
01:36:20,490 --> 01:36:21,150
But that's okay...

1966
01:36:22,090 --> 01:36:23,610
Because I've wasted a lot of time...

1967
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:25,950
I don't know if it's a hidden door...

1968
01:36:26,610 --> 01:36:27,770
Or if it's a...

1969
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,610
Door past the initial door...

1970
01:36:32,410 --> 01:36:33,810
But that's okay...

1971
01:36:37,450 --> 01:36:40,830
This song in particular will haunt me...

1972
01:36:42,370 --> 01:36:44,890
You wouldn't think a ghost could get haunted...

1973
01:36:44,890 --> 01:36:45,350
But...

1974
01:36:47,710 --> 01:36:51,290
Okay, nice...

1975
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:57,650
I touched him...

1976
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:19,350
What if I'm like really deathly allergic to shellfish or something...

1977
01:37:20,190 --> 01:37:22,430
And so that's why...

1978
01:37:22,430 --> 01:37:24,910
It's like really dangerous for me...

1979
01:37:26,990 --> 01:37:29,350
To touch these guys, you know...

1980
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:38,460
I'm just so deathly allergic to shellfish...

1981
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:41,120
Oh my gosh...

1982
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:43,260
I almost overcorrected that...

1983
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:45,260
That would have been bad...

1984
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:46,820
Nice...

1985
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,880
Alright, that was...

1986
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:50,500
Alright, now we...

1987
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:52,260
Okay, okay!

1988
01:38:21,190 --> 01:38:22,990
Geez, you can hit yourself...

1989
01:38:22,990 --> 01:38:24,150
Yeah, you can...

1990
01:38:24,150 --> 01:38:24,830
But only...

1991
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:27,670
I think it's only if you hit yourself in the face...

1992
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:29,750
Thank you for the pink!

1993
01:38:29,930 --> 01:38:30,790
Thank you!

1994
01:38:31,490 --> 01:38:34,590
I mean, you could blame me for like throwing it preemptively...

1995
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:37,770
But also can you blame me for throwing it preemptively...

1996
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:39,010
Because like...

1997
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:44,450
Sometimes I'm like, am I gonna make this?

1998
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:46,230
Like, see?

1999
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:51,220
Like that!

2000
01:38:57,150 --> 01:38:58,070
Okay, nice.

2001
01:39:07,530 --> 01:39:11,370
We wait for him to drop down, then we jump across.

2002
01:39:12,230 --> 01:39:12,990
Like so.

2003
01:39:15,290 --> 01:39:16,450
Okay.

2004
01:39:18,490 --> 01:39:21,790
Now we're running past this door.

2005
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:27,090
Hopefully, it's shortly past.

2006
01:39:32,610 --> 01:39:34,050
Got something.

2007
01:39:36,110 --> 01:39:37,270
Okay.

2008
01:39:38,570 --> 01:39:40,750
Oh my god!

2009
01:39:41,230 --> 01:39:42,710
Please, please!

2010
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:44,330
20th zone!

2011
01:39:45,850 --> 01:39:46,550
20th zone!

2012
01:39:46,630 --> 01:39:47,050
20th zone!

2013
01:39:47,110 --> 01:39:47,570
20th zone!

2014
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:48,330
20th zone!

2015
01:39:53,150 --> 01:39:53,670
Keyword!

2016
01:39:54,190 --> 01:39:54,710
Nagoya!

2017
01:40:10,420 --> 01:40:11,480
What just happened?

2018
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:12,560
Why am I back here?

2019
01:40:14,060 --> 01:40:21,600
Why am I... Why am I... Why am I back... Why am I... Why am I back here?

2020
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:29,420
Was I not supposed... Was I supposed to ignore that door?

2021
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:34,760
Keyword!

2022
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:36,580
And the moi!

2023
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:41,060
I didn't know this was a Metal Gear game!

2024
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:46,300
I threw my bomb too late.

2025
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:49,400
Wait!

2026
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:50,180
Wait!

2027
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:55,820
I think you have to go backwards on 20th?

2028
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:59,460
If we make it... If we make it there again, we'll try!

2029
01:40:59,460 --> 01:40:59,740
I think you have to go backwards on 20th?

2030
01:40:59,740 --> 01:40:59,740
If we make it there again, we'll try!

2031
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:05,340
Though!

2032
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:06,760
I'll be honest.

2033
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:08,560
Even if I get to level 100...

2034
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:08,620
Though!

2035
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:08,620
I'll be honest.

2036
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:08,620
Even if I get to level 100...

2037
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:13,140
Um, through this method...

2038
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:15,760
I think I'll keep... I don't know.

2039
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:17,240
It feels too easy, right?

2040
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:17,940
Like...

2041
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:20,660
I've only been playing for 2 hours.

2042
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:22,160
Less than 2 hours, so...

2043
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:24,980
I do want to try maybe the other method.

2044
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:30,180
The 11 to 50 to... Oops, I forgot where I was at.

2045
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:32,980
To... To... I don't know.

2046
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:37,600
Is there anyone who has played this game?

2047
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:39,700
Levels... Levels 1?

2048
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:42,060
Oh my gosh.

2049
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:42,480
Ugh!

2050
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:43,940
Okay, nice, nice, nice, nice.

2051
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,920
Levels... Like, in complete order, I wonder.

2052
01:41:49,340 --> 01:41:50,040
Okay, nice.

2053
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:51,200
Oh,

2054
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:03,620
wait!

2055
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:04,660
Can I go back?

2056
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:08,930
Can I like... No.

2057
01:42:23,310 --> 01:42:24,350
Oh my god!

2058
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:25,350
No way!

2059
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:26,530
No!

2060
01:42:27,370 --> 01:42:28,850
No way!

2061
01:42:29,130 --> 01:42:30,990
And it reset the counter!

2062
01:42:31,590 --> 01:42:31,930
Yo!

2063
01:42:33,050 --> 01:42:34,590
Oh my god!

2064
01:42:35,050 --> 01:42:36,370
Are you kidding me right now?

2065
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:41,900
That's... incredible.

2066
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:43,320
Best game ever!

2067
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:51,140
Do I bomb them?

2068
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:53,500
Keyword, Nagoya.

2069
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:55,400
Okay...

2070
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:58,400
Oh!

2071
01:42:58,860 --> 01:43:00,680
Wait, I can jump on these guys.

2072
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:02,200
No, no, no, no!

2073
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:06,590
Oh!

2074
01:43:14,150 --> 01:43:14,910
Nagoya.

2075
01:43:15,950 --> 01:43:16,710
Nagoya.

2076
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:18,350
Nagoya.

2077
01:43:19,370 --> 01:43:20,130
Nagoya.

2078
01:43:20,870 --> 01:43:22,070
Keyword, Nagoya.

2079
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:23,710
Nagoya.

2080
01:43:28,350 --> 01:43:29,830
I'm afraid to jump.

2081
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:32,390
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2082
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:44,220
Na na na na na Na na na na na No.

2083
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:46,600
I don't know yet.

2084
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:47,280
Ah!

2085
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:49,020
temperature.

2086
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:52,980
Oh!

2087
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:54,740
It sounds like a classical song.

2088
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:55,420
Now, like...

2089
01:43:55,420 --> 01:43:57,520
Someone made when they were...

2090
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:00,760
When they had scarlet fever or something like...

2091
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:02,320
I am the Black Plague!

2092
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,760
My mind is going...

2093
01:44:06,980 --> 01:44:08,620
Why didn't it stop him?

2094
01:44:08,740 --> 01:44:09,380
The bomb!

2095
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:11,960
Why didn't it stop him?

2096
01:44:16,110 --> 01:44:18,190
Maybe you have to jump on their heads in a certain order.

2097
01:44:19,690 --> 01:44:20,690
I have no idea.

2098
01:44:21,310 --> 01:44:23,150
It might be time to give up on this route.

2099
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:26,890
If there was like no way... How do you do it though?

2100
01:44:31,450 --> 01:44:32,990
Do I have to blow them up maybe?

2101
01:44:33,070 --> 01:44:34,210
Like in a special way?

2102
01:44:35,230 --> 01:44:36,510
I'm just not sure.

2103
01:44:39,450 --> 01:44:42,970
So this must be endless A everyone is talking about.

2104
01:44:49,390 --> 01:44:50,170
Let's see.

2105
01:44:53,230 --> 01:44:54,170
Oh, please.

2106
01:44:55,850 --> 01:44:58,390
Uh oh, we've wasted a lot of time.

2107
01:44:59,230 --> 01:45:00,910
A lot of time.

2108
01:45:02,210 --> 01:45:06,330
I don't even know if I'll make it to the...

2109
01:45:06,630 --> 01:45:07,390
To level 10.

2110
01:45:07,670 --> 01:45:09,210
How do I do that?

2111
01:45:12,570 --> 01:45:14,610
I don't even know if I'll make it to level 10.

2112
01:45:15,770 --> 01:45:16,170
Shoot.

2113
01:45:18,390 --> 01:45:20,190
But if I do, I can just go back.

2114
01:45:34,150 --> 01:45:37,770
If you're still at this in 6 hours, we'll tell you how the Naglia room works.

2115
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:40,390
You're too kind.

2116
01:45:41,810 --> 01:45:42,770
You're too kind.

2117
01:45:44,310 --> 01:45:47,390
Kacho Arino also has mint clothes.

2118
01:45:50,650 --> 01:45:51,630
Oh, look at that.

2119
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:52,510
It's closed now.

2120
01:45:52,830 --> 01:45:53,590
Isn't that kind of funny?

2121
01:45:55,730 --> 01:45:57,010
But also, you're right.

2122
01:45:57,930 --> 01:45:59,230
Arino does have...

2123
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:01,790
Does have mint clothes.

2124
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:07,390
The Naglia room is actually unsolvable?

2125
01:46:09,950 --> 01:46:10,870
What do you mean?

2126
01:46:10,870 --> 01:46:12,270
What do you mean by that?

2127
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:14,990
And also, like, if I practice here...

2128
01:46:14,990 --> 01:46:16,590
Yeah, see, like...

2129
01:46:19,070 --> 01:46:23,990
But it's in the guide that you can go from 20 to...

2130
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:30,060
It's solvable?

2131
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:35,760
Do I have to, like, get it in their mouths?

2132
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:46,080
It's a secret code.

2133
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:51,800
Na...

2134
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:53,580
Go...

2135
01:46:57,020 --> 01:46:57,560
Yeah.

2136
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:01,940
Something to do with the plants.

2137
01:47:06,870 --> 01:47:10,230
I think this is my last life anyway, so it's probably fine to...

2138
01:47:10,230 --> 01:47:13,610
If you were in Naglia...

2139
01:47:15,410 --> 01:47:15,950
No.

2140
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:33,440
Umm...

2141
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:39,760
That wasn't my last one.

2142
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:48,880
Wait!

2143
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:50,040
Na...

2144
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:50,680
Seven.

2145
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:51,920
So, seven there.

2146
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:52,360
Go!

2147
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,380
One, two, three, four, five...

2148
01:47:54,980 --> 01:47:55,420
Yeah!

2149
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:57,000
Eight?

2150
01:47:57,820 --> 01:47:58,440
I don't know.

2151
01:47:58,520 --> 01:47:58,900
Actually...

2152
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:02,820
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

2153
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:09,040
Do I have to, like, get it on top of their heads?

2154
01:48:13,210 --> 01:48:14,310
Like, if I...

2155
01:48:17,050 --> 01:48:18,550
Do I have to, like, blow up...

2156
01:48:19,590 --> 01:48:21,490
Like, seven on top of their heads?

2157
01:48:25,710 --> 01:48:26,190
Nagoya...

2158
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:30,540
See, see, see, see?

2159
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:34,480
Oh my god, that's, like, so hard.

2160
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:35,660
That's actually...

2161
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:37,020
So...

2162
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:38,740
So tricky!

2163
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,020
Oh, so close!

2164
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:43,640
Ah...

2165
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:44,800
I think I...

2166
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:47,320
Oh, dang.

2167
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:48,020
Oh...

2168
01:48:48,020 --> 01:48:48,640
Ah!

2169
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:52,830
Ah...

2170
01:48:55,820 --> 01:48:57,860
It's, like, pixel perfect.

2171
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:03,760
Drop it by crouching?

2172
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:09,800
What if I...

2173
01:49:11,020 --> 01:49:12,040
Oh...

2174
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:13,860
No...

2175
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:15,700
It doesn't need...

2176
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:16,880
One, two...

2177
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:18,720
How do I even know if it's working?

2178
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:19,540
Three...

2179
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:20,400
Four...

2180
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:22,660
Five...

2181
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:24,400
Six...

2182
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:26,140
Seven...

2183
01:49:31,810 --> 01:49:32,090
Nine...

2184
01:49:51,610 --> 01:49:51,890
10...

2185
01:49:51,890 --> 01:49:51,970
11...

2186
01:49:51,970 --> 01:49:51,990
12...

2187
01:49:51,990 --> 01:49:52,010
13...

2188
01:49:52,010 --> 01:49:52,170
17...

2189
01:49:52,170 --> 01:49:52,190
18...

2190
01:49:52,190 --> 01:49:52,390
19...

2191
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:52,490
21...

2192
01:49:52,490 --> 01:49:52,570
23...

2193
01:49:52,570 --> 01:49:52,590
25...

2194
01:49:52,590 --> 01:49:52,950
26...

2195
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:52,970
26...

2196
01:49:52,970 --> 01:49:53,010
27...

2197
01:49:54,590 --> 01:49:54,870
28...

2198
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:55,790
29...

2199
01:50:02,050 --> 01:50:02,330
30...

2200
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:07,980
31...

2201
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:08,120
32...

2202
01:50:08,120 --> 01:50:08,200
33...

2203
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:08,340
34...

2204
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:20,220
35...

2205
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:25,880
36...

2206
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:27,040
36...

2207
01:50:41,650 --> 01:50:43,050
37...

2208
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:43,570
5...

2209
01:50:43,570 --> 01:50:44,990
Island...

2210
01:50:44,990 --> 01:50:45,810
No...

2211
01:50:45,810 --> 01:50:47,710
15...

2212
01:50:47,710 --> 01:50:47,750
32...

2213
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:51,470
The... oh my god... truly a mysterious place.

2214
01:50:54,610 --> 01:50:56,210
That was so close.

2215
01:51:06,530 --> 01:51:08,210
Very naso indeed.

2216
01:51:12,370 --> 01:51:15,650
Oh, I'm just gonna jump over you guys.

2217
01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:27,750
Yeah, I'm still not raging.

2218
01:51:27,970 --> 01:51:28,870
I think I'm still okay.

2219
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:33,750
Nice.

2220
01:51:34,610 --> 01:51:36,310
Has it honestly been a month already?

2221
01:51:36,670 --> 01:51:37,230
That's crazy.

2222
01:51:38,850 --> 01:51:39,810
Here I am.

2223
01:51:41,370 --> 01:51:42,330
Not raging.

2224
01:51:45,710 --> 01:51:46,390
Oh my god.

2225
01:51:46,490 --> 01:51:47,190
Oh my god.

2226
01:51:47,330 --> 01:51:47,830
Oh my god!

2227
01:51:48,650 --> 01:51:49,130
Okay,

2228
01:51:53,230 --> 01:51:53,950
eleventh zone!

2229
01:51:54,330 --> 01:51:55,930
I don't remember what this zone was like.

2230
01:51:57,730 --> 01:51:59,170
Oh yes, I do remember!

2231
01:51:59,470 --> 01:52:00,670
I have to blow myself up here.

2232
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:02,070
Let's get some treasure though.

2233
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:03,310
Very nice.

2234
01:52:04,210 --> 01:52:05,810
I have to blow myself up here.

2235
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:08,910
Okay, then we go to the 52nd zone.

2236
01:52:09,650 --> 01:52:10,130
52nd!

2237
01:52:12,790 --> 01:52:15,070
Oh, I do remember this zone!

2238
01:52:19,070 --> 01:52:19,550
Locusts.

2239
01:52:21,330 --> 01:52:21,810
Locusts.

2240
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:26,360
Please.

2241
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:26,940
Please!

2242
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:28,060
Leave me alone!

2243
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:31,060
Oh, okay.

2244
01:52:31,900 --> 01:52:32,500
Nice.

2245
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:36,400
Oh no no no no no no no!

2246
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:39,380
Please!

2247
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:53,220
Okay, just keep going.

2248
01:53:04,350 --> 01:53:06,030
Please throw a bomb!

2249
01:53:06,770 --> 01:53:07,370
Okay.

2250
01:53:07,490 --> 01:53:08,050
Okay.

2251
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:12,880
Nice.

2252
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:13,480
Nice.

2253
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:13,680
Nice.

2254
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:14,420
Wait!

2255
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:15,280
Wait wait wait!

2256
01:53:15,380 --> 01:53:16,080
This is where the...

2257
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:17,940
This is where we're supposed to find the other door!

2258
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:19,560
The other door to darkness!

2259
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:20,320
Oh gosh.

2260
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:21,940
Um...

2261
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:23,400
Oh...

2262
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:27,160
Is it on one of these platforms?

2263
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:28,020
Oh shoot.

2264
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:30,540
Um...

2265
01:53:33,790 --> 01:53:35,710
Because if we go down here...

2266
01:53:36,710 --> 01:53:37,370
Oh shoot.

2267
01:53:37,450 --> 01:53:37,830
Oh shoot.

2268
01:53:37,870 --> 01:53:38,170
Oh shoot.

2269
01:53:38,630 --> 01:53:39,070
Yes!

2270
01:53:39,250 --> 01:53:39,650
Okay, good.

2271
01:53:40,310 --> 01:53:41,170
Maybe like...

2272
01:53:41,510 --> 01:53:41,730
Uh...

2273
01:53:44,170 --> 01:53:44,610
Shoot.

2274
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:44,730
Shoot.

2275
01:53:45,190 --> 01:53:45,630
Shoot.

2276
01:53:46,110 --> 01:53:46,550
Shoot.

2277
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:47,390
Shoot!

2278
01:53:49,050 --> 01:53:50,790
No no no, I can't go through that one!

2279
01:53:51,570 --> 01:53:52,510
Oh my god, please.

2280
01:53:54,450 --> 01:53:54,890
Uh...

2281
01:53:55,630 --> 01:53:57,050
Is it past the other door?

2282
01:53:57,170 --> 01:53:59,350
I don't think so...

2283
01:54:01,110 --> 01:54:02,210
I don't think I can...

2284
01:54:02,210 --> 01:54:04,170
I don't think I can jump over that.

2285
01:54:05,890 --> 01:54:06,330
Unless...

2286
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:07,570
Yeah.

2287
01:54:07,870 --> 01:54:08,190
Ugh!

2288
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:15,360
Uh oh.

2289
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:16,640
I can't go back.

2290
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:20,720
I'm stuck here.

2291
01:54:21,580 --> 01:54:23,200
I can't go back!

2292
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:23,900
Uh...

2293
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:25,700
I can't go back!

2294
01:54:37,430 --> 01:54:38,090
Shoot...

2295
01:54:38,090 --> 01:54:39,070
Oh!

2296
01:54:39,850 --> 01:54:40,510
Okay...

2297
01:54:40,510 --> 01:54:41,890
And we're stuck here too.

2298
01:54:42,370 --> 01:54:43,570
Now we're stuck here.

2299
01:54:45,710 --> 01:54:46,370
Ugh.

2300
01:54:47,730 --> 01:54:48,390
Okay.

2301
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:49,430
That's fine.

2302
01:54:49,610 --> 01:54:52,550
It doesn't take much to get to the next level, so...

2303
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:54,170
So...

2304
01:54:54,170 --> 01:54:57,370
To get to... from 11 to 50... whatever... 54.

2305
01:54:58,110 --> 01:54:59,290
So I think we'll be okay.

2306
01:55:02,350 --> 01:55:04,170
How does Mint know all of that?

2307
01:55:04,410 --> 01:55:05,070
All of what?

2308
01:55:06,050 --> 01:55:06,850
What do I know?

2309
01:55:07,070 --> 01:55:08,010
I don't know anything.

2310
01:55:09,450 --> 01:55:10,930
I don't know anything!

2311
01:55:12,510 --> 01:55:13,030
52.

2312
01:55:13,370 --> 01:55:13,610
Oh.

2313
01:55:13,870 --> 01:55:14,610
Thank you!

2314
01:55:14,790 --> 01:55:14,870
Thank you!

2315
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:15,530
Two!

2316
01:55:16,550 --> 01:55:17,070
Nine!

2317
01:55:17,070 --> 01:55:17,610
Thank you!

2318
01:55:17,910 --> 01:55:19,610
I always love retro gameplay.

2319
01:55:21,630 --> 01:55:22,870
Yeah, I do too.

2320
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:24,950
Until it's like this, you know?

2321
01:55:27,610 --> 01:55:29,710
Orly, that should've been mine.

2322
01:55:31,130 --> 01:55:31,610
That...

2323
01:55:32,550 --> 01:55:33,290
should've... oh wait.

2324
01:55:34,030 --> 01:55:35,330
I think I messed up, you guys.

2325
01:55:35,770 --> 01:55:36,390
Uh oh.

2326
01:55:38,790 --> 01:55:39,270
Go!

2327
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:45,320
Go!

2328
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:45,600
Go!

2329
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:46,880
Okay, game over.

2330
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:01,380
If I were a hidden door...

2331
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:03,360
Where would I be?

2332
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:03,800
Where would I be?

2333
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:08,960
If I were a hidden door...

2334
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:13,400
Where?

2335
01:56:17,120 --> 01:56:18,260
Where would I be?

2336
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:21,420
Oh.

2337
01:56:21,580 --> 01:56:22,520
That was so close.

2338
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:25,420
Gosha!

2339
01:56:25,740 --> 01:56:27,400
Thank you so much for the 50 gift!

2340
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:28,040
Thank you!

2341
01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:29,160
Also, wait.

2342
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:29,760
I'm so sorry.

2343
01:56:29,860 --> 01:56:32,240
Someone also superchatted the pink earlier.

2344
01:56:33,380 --> 01:56:36,220
I had a nap while listening to your screams and I woke up to a bee in my hair!

2345
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:38,620
I like bees, but that freaked me out.

2346
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:39,180
How's this...

2347
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:39,940
How's this going?

2348
01:56:40,060 --> 01:56:40,660
Are you winning?

2349
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:42,060
Shwanky!

2350
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:44,460
I'm so sorry you had a bee in your hair.

2351
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:45,720
What?

2352
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:49,340
That sounds a little frightening.

2353
01:56:55,770 --> 01:56:56,510
She's winning.

2354
01:57:05,610 --> 01:57:06,670
Maybe like right here.

2355
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:14,760
Not there.

2356
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:18,320
Maybe where this treasure box is.

2357
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:19,760
Maybe where this treasure box is.

2358
01:57:19,780 --> 01:57:20,700
Shoot.

2359
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:23,340
Never mind.

2360
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:28,780
Do you think I...

2361
01:57:28,780 --> 01:57:29,000
Ugh.

2362
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:31,340
Yeah.

2363
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,100
Okay.

2364
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:33,300
Not where the treasure box is.

2365
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:34,980
Oh my god.

2366
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:37,120
There we go.

2367
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:40,680
What the...

2368
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:42,700
I... I got that!

2369
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:44,200
Excuse me!

2370
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:46,100
I got that!

2371
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:49,980
I got that!

2372
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:51,820
I got that so...

2373
01:57:51,820 --> 01:57:52,360
No.

2374
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:53,380
No.

2375
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:55,720
This game cheated me.

2376
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:09,180
Here?

2377
01:58:09,620 --> 01:58:11,580
I think I tried here before.

2378
01:58:14,290 --> 01:58:21,660
Also, if you're trying to say what it is in the chat, please don't because I am not asking for answers right now.

2379
01:58:21,980 --> 01:58:22,720
You know what?

2380
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:23,360
Let's just try anywhere.

2381
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:28,060
I didn't walk enough.

2382
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:32,980
We lost the 50-50.

2383
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:34,900
What's the... What were you betting on?

2384
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:36,460
What are you betting on, huh?

2385
01:58:39,820 --> 01:58:40,800
It wasn't here.

2386
01:58:42,260 --> 01:58:42,900
Oh my goodness.

2387
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:43,360
Shoot.

2388
01:58:44,180 --> 01:58:44,700
Shoot.

2389
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:47,800
Oh my god!

2390
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,820
I jumped too much now.

2391
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:57,400
Maybe next to the treasure chest.

2392
01:59:08,570 --> 01:59:09,730
You're doing amazing.

2393
01:59:09,930 --> 01:59:10,590
Thank you.

2394
01:59:13,310 --> 01:59:13,870
Please.

2395
01:59:13,870 --> 01:59:14,870
Why does it...

2396
01:59:14,870 --> 01:59:16,910
Why can't it be consistent with the enemies?

2397
01:59:17,030 --> 01:59:17,330
You know?

2398
01:59:17,570 --> 01:59:20,050
All I'm asking for is...

2399
01:59:20,650 --> 01:59:21,210
Oh my god.

2400
01:59:22,430 --> 01:59:25,390
All I'm asking for is a little consistency here.

2401
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:27,270
Just think about Nagoya.

2402
01:59:28,090 --> 01:59:30,590
Nagoya is the key word to beating this game.

2403
01:59:33,070 --> 01:59:33,630
Oh!

2404
01:59:33,630 --> 01:59:34,510
Oh my god!

2405
01:59:34,510 --> 01:59:36,470
I took out two bugs with one bomb!

2406
01:59:38,050 --> 01:59:39,190
You know what they say.

2407
01:59:39,490 --> 01:59:40,990
Two bugs with one bomb.

2408
01:59:42,570 --> 01:59:43,130
Wait.

2409
01:59:43,230 --> 01:59:44,430
I lost the timer again.

2410
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:48,610
Yeah.

2411
01:59:50,250 --> 01:59:51,590
Take my wrath.

2412
01:59:52,570 --> 01:59:53,690
Take my...

2413
01:59:53,690 --> 01:59:54,770
fury!

2414
01:59:57,250 --> 02:00:01,990
I got bugged.

2415
02:00:09,120 --> 02:00:11,400
No, please stop coming for me.

2416
02:00:20,490 --> 02:00:21,330
I can't.

2417
02:00:21,930 --> 02:00:22,930
Is that a game over?

2418
02:00:23,010 --> 02:00:23,210
Yup.

2419
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:37,240
Now I won't feel so bad.

2420
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:37,660
Oh.

2421
02:00:37,860 --> 02:00:39,420
I dropped a bomb instead of jumping.

2422
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:39,760
My bad.

2423
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:50,360
Now I won't feel so bad if we get all the way to to the final levels because it's already been a challenge enough getting there.

2424
02:00:51,180 --> 02:00:51,600
...

2425
02:00:54,120 --> 02:00:54,680
...

2426
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:54,900
...

2427
02:00:56,060 --> 02:00:56,620
...

2428
02:00:56,620 --> 02:00:59,760
and we gonna...

2429
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:05,200
gosh ... You're totally bugged.

2430
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:08,640
No, this game is genuinely a about the journey.

2431
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:12,200
It's about something.

2432
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:15,960
We are just a little guy trying to find Atlantis.

2433
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:16,320
Okay.

2434
02:01:16,380 --> 02:01:16,700
Actually.

2435
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:17,920
Are we in Atlantis?

2436
02:01:18,780 --> 02:01:20,880
Are we going to Atlantis or are we going to Atlantis?

2437
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:24,540
I'm kind of confused about that part.

2438
02:01:25,140 --> 02:01:27,900
Because if we found Atlantis and we're here...

2439
02:01:27,900 --> 02:01:30,000
in Atlantis...

2440
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:34,200
What's the mystery?

2441
02:01:36,580 --> 02:01:38,760
Why it's built like this?

2442
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:41,080
No wonder everybody died in Atlantis.

2443
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:43,180
Look how your society is built.

2444
02:01:45,480 --> 02:01:47,460
Look how your society is built.

2445
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:48,140
Here we go.

2446
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:49,060
We're back.

2447
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:50,880
Baby bug.

2448
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:55,240
He just so, so slowly...

2449
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:56,780
grazes my head.

2450
02:01:58,160 --> 02:01:59,380
It's so funny.

2451
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:00,940
It's not funny at all.

2452
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:02,980
It's so frustrating.

2453
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:04,540
Okay, there we go.

2454
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:07,540
And then if I hadn't made that jump...

2455
02:02:07,540 --> 02:02:09,220
that would have been so sad.

2456
02:02:09,460 --> 02:02:11,380
I can't throw another bomb...

2457
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:12,440
until the one explodes.

2458
02:02:12,740 --> 02:02:15,280
Which also just really messes me up.

2459
02:02:15,420 --> 02:02:17,100
It really grinds my gears.

2460
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:19,780
Yes.

2461
02:02:21,140 --> 02:02:21,820
Okay.

2462
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:26,780
No, no, no, no.

2463
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:28,520
Oh my god.

2464
02:02:28,700 --> 02:02:29,600
Oh my god.

2465
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:33,240
Nice.

2466
02:02:33,940 --> 02:02:35,520
Okay, here, here maybe.

2467
02:02:36,460 --> 02:02:37,140
Blow!

2468
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:39,780
Yes!

2469
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:43,620
That was what I was hoping for.

2470
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:46,080
Throw!

2471
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:50,780
Is it next to the other door?

2472
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:53,700
They wouldn't do that, would they?

2473
02:02:55,820 --> 02:02:56,260
Uh oh.

2474
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:56,740
Uh oh.

2475
02:02:57,740 --> 02:02:58,280
There we go.

2476
02:03:01,060 --> 02:03:03,020
It's not next to the other door, is it?

2477
02:03:03,420 --> 02:03:03,780
It's not next to the other door, is it?

2478
02:03:20,410 --> 02:03:21,950
I have to like throw it so...

2479
02:03:21,950 --> 02:03:22,310
Oh!

2480
02:03:22,970 --> 02:03:23,770
Okay, it's not.

2481
02:03:24,410 --> 02:03:25,610
Maybe if I throw it from here.

2482
02:03:25,750 --> 02:03:27,010
Maybe that's the key.

2483
02:03:27,230 --> 02:03:27,550
No?

2484
02:03:27,710 --> 02:03:28,050
Okay.

2485
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:30,830
They're not trying to give me hints at all.

2486
02:03:32,610 --> 02:03:32,990
They're not trying to give me hints at all.

2487
02:03:34,390 --> 02:03:34,790
Bug!

2488
02:03:37,150 --> 02:03:38,790
But sometimes it's also pretty specific.

2489
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:44,900
Where did I throw it from?

2490
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:45,580
Oh, there, there, there.

2491
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:46,340
Oh, no.

2492
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:48,840
Time out!

2493
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:50,640
It's okay.

2494
02:03:50,700 --> 02:03:52,580
We're gonna have to do a lot of trial and error for this.

2495
02:03:52,660 --> 02:03:56,420
So, honestly, it's best that we time out than getting bugged.

2496
02:03:58,240 --> 02:03:59,380
At least I...

2497
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:01,300
Look at him.

2498
02:04:01,420 --> 02:04:02,400
What an idiot.

2499
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:03,320
Now he's gonna drown!

2500
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:04,020
Oh.

2501
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:06,280
You don't drown, but I can.

2502
02:04:07,120 --> 02:04:07,640
Okay.

2503
02:04:07,740 --> 02:04:08,420
This is fine.

2504
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:11,500
This is fine.

2505
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:13,980
Okay.

2506
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:15,720
Where else could it be?

2507
02:04:17,180 --> 02:04:17,800
Oh, wait.

2508
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:20,460
Oh my god!

2509
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:26,160
Maybe, like, I stand here and throw it.

2510
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:27,580
You know?

2511
02:04:27,820 --> 02:04:29,760
Maybe the opening is like a little...

2512
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:34,460
Oh, shoot.

2513
02:04:36,940 --> 02:04:37,420
Blah!

2514
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:44,460
He's built it for 50 seconds.

2515
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:47,440
Okay.

2516
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:48,160
It's not there.

2517
02:04:48,980 --> 02:04:49,840
It's there.

2518
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:50,280
No.

2519
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:51,940
Is it...

2520
02:04:51,940 --> 02:04:53,960
Did I try next to the treasure box?

2521
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:55,580
I don't think I...

2522
02:04:56,180 --> 02:04:56,600
There we go.

2523
02:04:56,700 --> 02:04:56,880
Nice.

2524
02:04:59,040 --> 02:04:59,960
I don't think I...

2525
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:01,380
Maybe if I aim from here.

2526
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:03,380
Aim.

2527
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:04,920
Aim.

2528
02:05:06,460 --> 02:05:06,940
Okay.

2529
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:07,400
I give up.

2530
02:05:08,380 --> 02:05:09,080
I don't know!

2531
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:11,480
Can you get exploded by your own bombs?

2532
02:05:11,580 --> 02:05:11,940
You can.

2533
02:05:12,920 --> 02:05:13,800
You actually can.

2534
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:18,360
Okay.

2535
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:19,620
Actually, what if I do this instead?

2536
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:21,220
Nope.

2537
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:25,280
Why do you throw it so much, you dummy?

2538
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:28,480
I'm gonna run out of time again.

2539
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:29,480
Okay.

2540
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:30,160
I want a hint.

2541
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:31,620
Do you want a hint?

2542
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:31,840
Yeah.

2543
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:32,240
Just a hint.

2544
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:32,940
Don't tell me where.

2545
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:33,560
Don't tell me where.

2546
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:34,160
But just a hint.

2547
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:35,720
Like, check...

2548
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:37,080
Check...

2549
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:39,120
Where the pillar meets three.

2550
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:42,120
One moment!

2551
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:43,540
Thank you!

2552
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:47,800
Hint of the last platform.

2553
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:51,180
Like...

2554
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:52,840
Like...

2555
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:54,980
Like right before the door?

2556
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:56,000
Or where the door is?

2557
02:06:00,990 --> 02:06:02,630
Last platform.

2558
02:06:12,100 --> 02:06:13,500
So this platform?

2559
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:16,080
Phew.

2560
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:18,540
It's under there.

2561
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:19,600
Under where?

2562
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:21,940
Only one hint.

2563
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:22,860
Last platform.

2564
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:23,400
Okay.

2565
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:23,840
Okay.

2566
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:24,160
Okay.

2567
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:24,400
Okay.

2568
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:25,820
So, wait.

2569
02:06:25,880 --> 02:06:26,320
If I...

2570
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:34,840
I wanted to jump and then throw it back onto the other platform.

2571
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:35,940
Oh, man.

2572
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:37,860
No!

2573
02:06:51,090 --> 02:06:51,610
Mummy?

2574
02:06:51,790 --> 02:06:52,130
Sorry.

2575
02:06:52,290 --> 02:06:52,630
Mummy?

2576
02:06:52,830 --> 02:06:53,350
Sorry.

2577
02:06:53,490 --> 02:06:53,810
Mummy?

2578
02:06:54,010 --> 02:06:54,530
Sorry.

2579
02:06:54,730 --> 02:06:55,250
Mummy?

2580
02:06:55,530 --> 02:06:56,050
Sorry.

2581
02:06:56,090 --> 02:06:56,350
Mummy?

2582
02:06:56,910 --> 02:06:57,430
Sorry.

2583
02:06:57,430 --> 02:06:57,730
Mummy?

2584
02:06:57,730 --> 02:06:57,730
Sorry.

2585
02:06:57,750 --> 02:06:58,090
Sorry.

2586
02:06:58,090 --> 02:06:58,090
Mummy?

2587
02:06:59,790 --> 02:07:00,150
Sorry.

2588
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:00,270
Mummy?

2589
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:00,270
Sorry.

2590
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:00,270
Mummy?

2591
02:07:02,770 --> 02:07:03,130
Oh.

2592
02:07:04,790 --> 02:07:05,150
Awww!

2593
02:07:08,250 --> 02:07:10,790
While we run out of lives, I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick.

2594
02:07:10,910 --> 02:07:11,070
While we run out of lives, I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick.

2595
02:07:11,070 --> 02:07:12,410
I'm gonna go to the little ghosty's room.

2596
02:07:12,970 --> 02:07:13,330
I'm gonna go to the little ghosty's room.

2597
02:07:13,590 --> 02:07:14,670
I hope you do not mind.

2598
02:07:15,430 --> 02:07:16,510
I will be right back.

2599
02:07:16,750 --> 02:07:17,330
Let me make...

2600
02:07:17,330 --> 02:07:17,470
Okay.

2601
02:07:17,730 --> 02:07:19,770
I'll be right back while I go to the ghosty's room.

2602
02:07:19,970 --> 02:07:21,410
You guys get some water as well.

2603
02:09:14,550 --> 02:09:15,270
I'm back.

2604
02:09:16,150 --> 02:09:16,930
I'm still alive?

2605
02:09:17,950 --> 02:09:18,870
How am I still alive?

2606
02:09:34,740 --> 02:09:35,670
Game over!

2607
02:09:35,710 --> 02:09:36,690
Perfect timing, right?

2608
02:09:36,790 --> 02:09:40,370
Okay, I'm gonna look back at the guide one more time.

2609
02:09:42,250 --> 02:09:47,190
Is there something we missed about what it says for the route?

2610
02:09:48,590 --> 02:09:50,210
Can I zoom in a little bit more?

2611
02:09:58,670 --> 02:10:10,730
What kind of masochist do you have to be to go for a high score in this game?

2612
02:10:23,980 --> 02:10:25,120
No, thank you.

2613
02:10:28,540 --> 02:10:29,660
There's scoreboards!

2614
02:10:31,560 --> 02:10:33,880
If I'm not top 50, why even play?

2615
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:39,900
I'm afraid of anyone that is... that holds a record in this game.

2616
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:44,220
I'm terrified of anybody that holds a record in this game.

2617
02:10:44,460 --> 02:10:48,740
Hold on, I'm... I'm... bank yo... bank yo time.

2618
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:50,140
Uh...

2619
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:54,380
Okay, Sight Down is just the shortest.

2620
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:56,000
Okay, that's what I figured, but...

2621
02:10:57,060 --> 02:10:57,500
Hmm...

2622
02:10:59,000 --> 02:10:59,880
But then...

2623
02:11:13,080 --> 02:11:14,100
What's the red route?

2624
02:11:16,780 --> 02:11:17,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

2625
02:11:18,440 --> 02:11:22,620
One, two, three, eight, ten...

2626
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:25,000
Four...

2627
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:27,000
Have we done four before?

2628
02:11:27,060 --> 02:11:27,580
What is this?

2629
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:28,300
The star!

2630
02:11:28,860 --> 02:11:30,680
Okay, you get a bunch of items.

2631
02:11:31,020 --> 02:11:31,880
Oh, oh no!

2632
02:11:33,220 --> 02:11:34,360
What page were we on?

2633
02:11:35,380 --> 02:11:35,820
Uh...

2634
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:38,160
Uh-oh, I lost my page.

2635
02:11:40,240 --> 02:11:40,920
Oh, there we go.

2636
02:11:42,700 --> 02:11:43,580
Twenty-five...

2637
02:11:43,580 --> 02:11:46,520
So it's the shortest, but it says it's an invincible route.

2638
02:11:48,640 --> 02:11:49,380
But ten!

2639
02:11:50,860 --> 02:11:52,100
We have to go through ten!

2640
02:11:57,900 --> 02:12:01,200
Okay, it says from ninety-seven to a hundred.

2641
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:04,260
The shoes are...

2642
02:12:04,260 --> 02:12:06,080
You have to have the shoes.

2643
02:12:13,130 --> 02:12:13,630
Okay...

2644
02:12:14,990 --> 02:12:15,490
Interesting.

2645
02:12:15,830 --> 02:12:19,310
So from ninety-seven to a hundred, you have to have the shoes for this route.

2646
02:12:19,610 --> 02:12:22,650
But this one bypasses the one that we're doing.

2647
02:12:23,590 --> 02:12:24,090
The...

2648
02:12:24,090 --> 02:12:26,250
This one bypasses...

2649
02:12:26,250 --> 02:12:27,230
Actually, how many...

2650
02:12:27,230 --> 02:12:32,190
How many stages are in this red route versus the orange route?

2651
02:12:32,930 --> 02:12:33,410
Uh...

2652
02:12:33,410 --> 02:12:33,870
Let's see.

2653
02:12:34,790 --> 02:12:36,450
Can we get a coffee meter?

2654
02:12:37,390 --> 02:12:39,050
I only have one can.

2655
02:12:39,170 --> 02:12:39,910
I only have one can.

2656
02:12:40,150 --> 02:12:40,630
So...

2657
02:12:41,530 --> 02:12:42,870
The shoes, you say.

2658
02:12:43,270 --> 02:12:44,290
The shoes here.

2659
02:12:44,430 --> 02:12:45,110
You get six.

2660
02:12:45,290 --> 02:12:51,170
So this is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

2661
02:12:51,530 --> 02:12:51,850
Okay.

2662
02:12:51,870 --> 02:12:53,010
One, two...

2663
02:12:55,070 --> 02:12:55,550
Three...

2664
02:12:56,590 --> 02:12:57,070
Four...

2665
02:12:57,070 --> 02:12:58,010
Five...

2666
02:12:58,010 --> 02:12:58,730
Six...

2667
02:12:58,730 --> 02:12:59,330
Seven...

2668
02:12:59,330 --> 02:13:00,170
Eight...

2669
02:13:00,170 --> 02:13:00,610
Nine...

2670
02:13:00,610 --> 02:13:00,890
Ten.

2671
02:13:02,730 --> 02:13:04,330
Did I count a hundred on the first one?

2672
02:13:04,430 --> 02:13:04,870
I don't remember.

2673
02:13:06,070 --> 02:13:07,010
Twelve in the red route.

2674
02:13:07,350 --> 02:13:08,790
So it's not even that big of a difference.

2675
02:13:09,370 --> 02:13:09,730
Okay.

2676
02:13:09,790 --> 02:13:10,730
So we have our two routes.

2677
02:13:10,830 --> 02:13:11,510
I think we should...

2678
02:13:11,510 --> 02:13:12,690
We would have to go, right?

2679
02:13:16,270 --> 02:13:16,830
But I'm...

2680
02:13:16,830 --> 02:13:19,330
This one is called the invincibility route.

2681
02:13:19,470 --> 02:13:20,550
So what does that even mean?

2682
02:13:20,750 --> 02:13:22,350
I have to beat level ten though.

2683
02:13:24,410 --> 02:13:25,130
Oh, God.

2684
02:13:28,030 --> 02:13:28,870
Oh, God.

2685
02:13:30,870 --> 02:13:31,750
Oh, God.

2686
02:13:34,230 --> 02:13:36,990
And then this thing that I need the shoes worries me.

2687
02:13:37,150 --> 02:13:39,550
What's going on in 97 that I need the shoes, huh?

2688
02:13:43,610 --> 02:13:45,070
Try Nagoya route again.

2689
02:13:47,570 --> 02:13:48,270
What is it?

2690
02:13:48,290 --> 02:13:49,170
What does it say for that one?

2691
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:49,370
Oh.

2692
02:13:50,270 --> 02:13:51,090
Ah, sorry.

2693
02:13:51,250 --> 02:13:51,670
I keep...

2694
02:13:52,510 --> 02:13:53,270
What is...

2695
02:13:53,270 --> 02:13:54,170
It's the blue route.

2696
02:13:54,470 --> 02:13:56,050
That's the high score route.

2697
02:13:56,750 --> 02:13:58,650
How does that even make any sense?

2698
02:13:58,790 --> 02:14:00,150
If you go from eight to twenty.

2699
02:14:00,150 --> 02:14:04,910
I guess you get the 400 points.

2700
02:14:05,710 --> 02:14:06,430
Oh no.

2701
02:14:06,930 --> 02:14:07,450
400...

2702
02:14:07,450 --> 02:14:08,110
Oh my God.

2703
02:14:09,790 --> 02:14:10,310
400...

2704
02:14:10,310 --> 02:14:11,430
400 points.

2705
02:14:12,730 --> 02:14:13,570
Oh my God.

2706
02:14:13,590 --> 02:14:15,130
You get a lot of points actually.

2707
02:14:15,310 --> 02:14:16,750
You get a ton of bajillion points.

2708
02:14:19,330 --> 02:14:22,150
Real question is how long is the longest route you can take?

2709
02:14:23,030 --> 02:14:25,230
I guess in regular order, right?

2710
02:14:25,910 --> 02:14:26,430
Okay.

2711
02:14:30,660 --> 02:14:31,180
Okay.

2712
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:33,800
Okay.

2713
02:14:43,230 --> 02:14:45,690
I think... okay.

2714
02:14:46,390 --> 02:14:51,510
I'll try and get the uh... the...

2715
02:14:53,590 --> 02:14:55,730
We'll try for 52 again.

2716
02:14:56,170 --> 02:14:58,150
I wonder what this little thing is.

2717
02:14:59,690 --> 02:15:02,730
We'll try for 52 again and then...

2718
02:15:12,150 --> 02:15:13,390
I'll try and find it.

2719
02:15:13,470 --> 02:15:14,470
I'll try and find it.

2720
02:15:16,910 --> 02:15:17,590
Okay.

2721
02:15:19,310 --> 02:15:19,990
Okay.

2722
02:15:20,410 --> 02:15:20,890
Alright.

2723
02:15:24,030 --> 02:15:24,710
Ikimashou.

2724
02:15:27,170 --> 02:15:28,190
Where's my...

2725
02:15:29,150 --> 02:15:29,530
Okay.

2726
02:15:30,390 --> 02:15:31,070
Okay.

2727
02:15:32,290 --> 02:15:32,970
Okay.

2728
02:15:34,230 --> 02:15:36,090
Dark blue line looks really long.

2729
02:15:42,230 --> 02:15:45,470
Let's go try and find us a hidden passage.

2730
02:15:50,790 --> 02:15:53,370
You guys said the pit was the last platform.

2731
02:16:12,030 --> 02:16:13,610
We can give another hint when you're ready.

2732
02:16:13,770 --> 02:16:14,390
No, it's okay.

2733
02:16:16,470 --> 02:16:17,330
It's okay.

2734
02:16:17,530 --> 02:16:17,730
It's okay.

2735
02:16:19,270 --> 02:16:19,970
Explosion!

2736
02:16:24,690 --> 02:16:26,940
Do you eventually loop around to loving this song?

2737
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:32,960
Love is a strong word, I think.

2738
02:16:35,670 --> 02:16:36,600
Just as hate.

2739
02:16:36,820 --> 02:16:41,840
Hate and love are two sides of the same coin.

2740
02:16:42,780 --> 02:16:43,480
Right?

2741
02:16:45,020 --> 02:16:45,720
Right.

2742
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:48,640
Woo!

2743
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:02,620
Oh no!

2744
02:17:07,820 --> 02:17:13,860
I know I get pretty close to them but it's the only way I can ensure true and total death.

2745
02:17:15,860 --> 02:17:17,940
True and total death!

2746
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:20,520
Okay.

2747
02:17:21,940 --> 02:17:23,280
If I just drop here.

2748
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:23,720
Alright.

2749
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:29,480
No...

2750
02:17:31,320 --> 02:17:32,500
Oh no no no no no!

2751
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:35,140
It's okay.

2752
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:36,560
We still have seven lives left.

2753
02:17:36,720 --> 02:17:40,040
Are you winning, Minto?

2754
02:17:41,820 --> 02:17:43,560
We're making progress.

2755
02:17:44,340 --> 02:17:44,920
Somehow.

2756
02:17:45,900 --> 02:17:47,940
We are making progress.

2757
02:17:48,300 --> 02:17:50,980
There's some progress being made.

2758
02:17:51,720 --> 02:17:53,820
We're level 54, you guys.

2759
02:17:56,800 --> 02:17:59,300
We're in the 50s.

2760
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:00,300
Oh my gosh.

2761
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:03,380
That was so close.

2762
02:18:04,950 --> 02:18:05,260
Ha!

2763
02:18:06,220 --> 02:18:09,080
That's what you get for getting too close to me.

2764
02:18:17,630 --> 02:18:18,950
Oh my god.

2765
02:18:19,050 --> 02:18:19,370
Oh my god!

2766
02:18:23,490 --> 02:18:24,730
50 seconds!

2767
02:18:27,350 --> 02:18:29,430
How did you find out about this game originally?

2768
02:18:30,130 --> 02:18:34,030
I originally watched the Game Center CX.

2769
02:18:35,350 --> 02:18:38,250
But also I watched Korone play it.

2770
02:18:40,930 --> 02:18:42,150
And so...

2771
02:18:43,350 --> 02:18:44,310
I was...

2772
02:18:44,310 --> 02:18:44,410
Oh!

2773
02:18:44,650 --> 02:18:45,890
Wrong button.

2774
02:18:46,190 --> 02:18:46,810
Oh my gosh.

2775
02:18:47,130 --> 02:18:48,670
So dangerous here.

2776
02:18:50,730 --> 02:18:53,310
So that's what got me interested in playing it.

2777
02:18:55,630 --> 02:18:56,230
Oh!

2778
02:18:58,490 --> 02:19:00,010
What is Game Center CX?

2779
02:19:00,210 --> 02:19:00,630
Oh my gosh!

2780
02:19:00,630 --> 02:19:01,410
It's so awesome!

2781
02:19:01,870 --> 02:19:07,450
Game Center CX is like a show where this guy just tries a bunch of games.

2782
02:19:08,090 --> 02:19:09,170
And like...

2783
02:19:10,110 --> 02:19:11,230
He has like...

2784
02:19:11,230 --> 02:19:12,850
Some rage challenges.

2785
02:19:12,850 --> 02:19:15,690
Like he played Takeshi's Castle and everything.

2786
02:19:16,390 --> 02:19:16,550
And...

2787
02:19:17,450 --> 02:19:18,710
Oh my god.

2788
02:19:18,750 --> 02:19:19,190
I'm gonna die!

2789
02:19:19,230 --> 02:19:19,650
The bug!

2790
02:19:22,730 --> 02:19:24,270
Japanese Ojisan Gamer Show.

2791
02:19:24,350 --> 02:19:25,170
It's really funny!

2792
02:19:25,950 --> 02:19:27,330
We love Arino Kacho.

2793
02:19:28,530 --> 02:19:30,190
It's really funny and...

2794
02:19:30,190 --> 02:19:30,310
Oh!

2795
02:19:31,890 --> 02:19:33,010
I flew!

2796
02:19:33,410 --> 02:19:34,490
I went flying!

2797
02:19:37,510 --> 02:19:38,070
Okay.

2798
02:19:43,370 --> 02:19:45,390
I like when there's only one bug there.

2799
02:19:45,650 --> 02:19:46,970
Makes things a little bit...

2800
02:19:47,510 --> 02:19:47,950
Easier.

2801
02:19:51,830 --> 02:19:54,130
I'm afraid of the other route just because of...

2802
02:19:54,130 --> 02:19:55,230
Oh my gosh.

2803
02:19:55,250 --> 02:19:56,010
I thought I was gonna die there.

2804
02:19:56,130 --> 02:19:58,530
Because I'd have to go through level 8 and 10.

2805
02:19:59,290 --> 02:19:59,730
But...

2806
02:19:59,730 --> 02:20:01,110
If that's what we gotta do...

2807
02:20:03,050 --> 02:20:06,430
A baby's gotta do what a baby's...

2808
02:20:07,630 --> 02:20:08,410
Gotta do.

2809
02:20:09,130 --> 02:20:11,890
I can't even get to the end of the platform anymore.

2810
02:20:12,030 --> 02:20:12,470
Man.

2811
02:20:27,470 --> 02:20:29,170
That was so close.

2812
02:20:29,610 --> 02:20:29,990
Oh.

2813
02:20:30,310 --> 02:20:30,930
Okay.

2814
02:20:31,030 --> 02:20:31,490
Never mind.

2815
02:20:32,470 --> 02:20:33,090
No!

2816
02:20:38,560 --> 02:20:38,960
No!

2817
02:20:43,770 --> 02:20:44,390
Okay.

2818
02:20:44,470 --> 02:20:45,270
Last platform.

2819
02:20:45,810 --> 02:20:47,970
I'm just gonna blow up everywhere that I can.

2820
02:20:48,290 --> 02:20:49,250
The way I'm gonna blow up.

2821
02:20:49,250 --> 02:20:49,290
Okay.

2822
02:20:49,410 --> 02:20:49,810
Uh oh.

2823
02:20:50,070 --> 02:20:52,490
Oh I got one guy at least.

2824
02:20:53,790 --> 02:20:54,270
Please.

2825
02:20:56,210 --> 02:20:56,850
There we go.

2826
02:20:57,710 --> 02:20:58,670
Last platform.

2827
02:20:58,990 --> 02:20:59,710
Does this...

2828
02:21:27,250 --> 02:21:29,290
Maybe the hole in the fence is a hint?

2829
02:21:29,430 --> 02:21:30,590
I tried it though!

2830
02:21:31,630 --> 02:21:32,930
I tried it.

2831
02:21:32,930 --> 02:21:34,350
I'm gonna run out of time with this rave.

2832
02:21:35,750 --> 02:21:37,030
Like I thought maybe...

2833
02:21:37,770 --> 02:21:38,790
Shooting in there.

2834
02:21:39,310 --> 02:21:39,990
Oh nice.

2835
02:21:40,390 --> 02:21:40,870
Oh.

2836
02:21:41,950 --> 02:21:43,950
But it doesn't... doesn't do anything.

2837
02:21:45,470 --> 02:21:46,070
Nooo.

2838
02:21:49,970 --> 02:21:52,110
Maybe if I shoot from here...

2839
02:21:52,110 --> 02:21:52,410
No.

2840
02:21:52,810 --> 02:21:55,050
Jump and shoot.

2841
02:22:00,150 --> 02:22:01,490
Go away bug.

2842
02:22:02,310 --> 02:22:03,530
You're bugging me.

2843
02:22:06,230 --> 02:22:06,950
It's okay.

2844
02:22:07,030 --> 02:22:07,870
I was out of time anyway.

2845
02:22:08,750 --> 02:22:09,690
I don't...

2846
02:22:09,690 --> 02:22:10,190
I don't know.

2847
02:22:11,790 --> 02:22:12,390
Yeah.

2848
02:22:12,430 --> 02:22:13,850
I've blown up every spot of this place.

2849
02:22:13,850 --> 02:22:14,230
I don't even know that part.

2850
02:22:15,070 --> 02:22:16,010
Oh my gosh.

2851
02:22:16,170 --> 02:22:16,950
Go away.

2852
02:22:18,070 --> 02:22:18,970
Let's see.

2853
02:22:19,690 --> 02:22:20,290
Hmm.

2854
02:22:38,150 --> 02:22:39,070
Oh my god.

2855
02:22:39,110 --> 02:22:39,830
I overjumped.

2856
02:22:45,650 --> 02:22:48,450
I really wanna find that spot though.

2857
02:22:51,810 --> 02:22:53,790
Is this another drop down entrance?

2858
02:22:54,650 --> 02:22:55,910
I don't think so.

2859
02:22:56,070 --> 02:22:56,410
Oh my god.

2860
02:22:58,590 --> 02:22:59,610
Oh my god.

2861
02:22:59,830 --> 02:23:00,270
I'm so sorry.

2862
02:23:00,290 --> 02:23:00,690
Whoop!

2863
02:23:06,260 --> 02:23:07,060
Poop!

2864
02:23:08,140 --> 02:23:08,940
Wow!

2865
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:13,220
Why are you higher than the last guy?

2866
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:15,600
Poop!

2867
02:23:17,560 --> 02:23:18,360
Poop!

2868
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:23,120
Ba-na-na-na-na!

2869
02:23:28,730 --> 02:23:29,530
Blow!

2870
02:23:33,590 --> 02:23:37,050
Okay, we're back, baby!

2871
02:23:38,050 --> 02:23:39,450
Why did I...

2872
02:23:43,370 --> 02:23:44,490
No worries!

2873
02:23:45,050 --> 02:23:49,030
I think we got an extra life somehow, so it's like we didn't even die.

2874
02:23:50,230 --> 02:23:50,970
There we go.

2875
02:23:58,910 --> 02:24:01,150
Oh my god, now it's two of them!

2876
02:24:03,490 --> 02:24:04,050
Shoot.

2877
02:24:06,090 --> 02:24:07,770
Okay, at least got one of them.

2878
02:24:08,870 --> 02:24:09,430
Uh

2879
02:24:13,490 --> 02:24:13,770
-oh.

2880
02:24:15,130 --> 02:24:15,690
Die.

2881
02:24:15,690 --> 02:24:16,630
Please die.

2882
02:24:18,050 --> 02:24:19,670
That was really close.

2883
02:24:20,330 --> 02:24:25,430
I almost overcompensated too much on that too.

2884
02:24:29,530 --> 02:24:33,210
And we're back, baby!

2885
02:24:33,770 --> 02:24:37,170
With our regularly scheduled programming.

2886
02:24:38,090 --> 02:24:39,690
Last platform.

2887
02:24:41,270 --> 02:24:43,810
Unless it means...

2888
02:24:55,870 --> 02:24:56,650
No!

2889
02:24:57,510 --> 02:24:59,050
It's not there for sure.

2890
02:25:00,350 --> 02:25:00,750
Huh?

2891
02:25:05,690 --> 02:25:07,050
Theory crafting time.

2892
02:25:07,270 --> 02:25:07,850
Atlanta sucks!

2893
02:25:09,290 --> 02:25:09,910
You know what?

2894
02:25:09,970 --> 02:25:11,670
No wonder everybody died here!

2895
02:25:11,810 --> 02:25:12,250
Unless it...

2896
02:25:12,250 --> 02:25:12,730
Is it like a...

2897
02:25:13,210 --> 02:25:14,330
No, it wouldn't be like...

2898
02:25:14,330 --> 02:25:14,710
I can't...

2899
02:25:14,710 --> 02:25:17,170
I can't be above the door because...

2900
02:25:17,170 --> 02:25:17,870
Oh my god.

2901
02:25:17,950 --> 02:25:18,370
Oh my god.

2902
02:25:18,650 --> 02:25:19,270
Oh my god.

2903
02:25:19,350 --> 02:25:19,930
Oh my god.

2904
02:25:20,990 --> 02:25:21,390
Oh!

2905
02:25:22,710 --> 02:25:23,910
That's a great theory.

2906
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:42,620
Oh...

2907
02:25:44,180 --> 02:25:44,700
Oh...

2908
02:25:44,700 --> 02:25:44,960
Oh, wow.

2909
02:25:45,940 --> 02:25:46,460
Ah!

2910
02:25:47,660 --> 02:25:49,500
Okay, can I get a hit number two?

2911
02:25:50,420 --> 02:25:52,320
Can I get a hit number two?

2912
02:25:52,320 --> 02:25:53,920
Have you tried under the bridge?

2913
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:56,540
Is it actually an under door?

2914
02:25:57,120 --> 02:25:57,640
Oh!

2915
02:25:58,240 --> 02:25:58,940
My bad.

2916
02:26:02,930 --> 02:26:04,370
It's not an invisible door.

2917
02:26:04,670 --> 02:26:05,170
What?

2918
02:26:06,590 --> 02:26:07,750
Wait, what do you mean by that?

2919
02:26:14,060 --> 02:26:15,080
Under the bridge?

2920
02:26:18,820 --> 02:26:19,580
Oh my god.

2921
02:26:35,450 --> 02:26:37,030
The last platform.

2922
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:52,040
I don't know if I've fallen here before.

2923
02:26:54,180 --> 02:26:55,220
Have I fallen here?

2924
02:27:00,020 --> 02:27:01,420
Okay, it wasn't that.

2925
02:27:03,800 --> 02:27:04,980
Oh, oh, no!

2926
02:27:11,510 --> 02:27:12,590
Okay, come here bugs.

2927
02:27:12,830 --> 02:27:14,350
I need to know how many there are of you.

2928
02:27:15,970 --> 02:27:16,830
Nice!

2929
02:27:19,370 --> 02:27:21,890
Sometimes the RNG just works.

2930
02:27:23,470 --> 02:27:26,010
Sometimes RNG just...

2931
02:27:28,030 --> 02:27:29,790
helps out a little bit.

2932
02:27:30,490 --> 02:27:32,810
Maybe at this platform?

2933
02:27:36,910 --> 02:27:37,770
Here?

2934
02:27:38,750 --> 02:27:39,170
Wee!

2935
02:27:40,410 --> 02:27:46,070
I remember watching a dog play this.

2936
02:27:46,410 --> 02:27:46,910
Yeah!

2937
02:27:51,580 --> 02:27:52,600
It's already a month.

2938
02:27:52,700 --> 02:27:53,480
Here's so many more.

2939
02:27:53,720 --> 02:27:54,280
Thank you!

2940
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:01,460
You're getting closer.

2941
02:28:33,090 --> 02:28:34,950
I wasn't sure I was going to make that.

2942
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:48,800
Maybe it is just safer to duck from those guys.

2943
02:28:50,740 --> 02:28:52,660
Because they're inconsistent as well.

2944
02:28:52,860 --> 02:28:55,580
Like, how far apart they are sometimes.

2945
02:29:01,760 --> 02:29:02,280
Anka!

2946
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:05,460
They say we're not a duck, we're vultures!

2947
02:29:08,060 --> 02:29:08,580
Anka!

2948
02:29:10,360 --> 02:29:10,800
Poop!

2949
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:11,100
Poop!

2950
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:12,480
And throw.

2951
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:16,780
I don't think they're ducks.

2952
02:29:16,960 --> 02:29:17,940
I don't think they are either.

2953
02:29:18,320 --> 02:29:20,040
I do not think they're ducks at all.

2954
02:29:28,790 --> 02:29:29,590
52nd zone!

2955
02:29:30,910 --> 02:29:31,350
Please.

2956
02:29:32,470 --> 02:29:35,870
I want to see the 54th.

2957
02:29:38,570 --> 02:29:40,230
I think it was 54 after this?

2958
02:29:40,390 --> 02:29:41,370
Oh, I meant it.

2959
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:42,690
Before I do that.

2960
02:29:48,650 --> 02:29:49,170
Beep!

2961
02:29:49,170 --> 02:29:49,370
Beep!

2962
02:29:49,370 --> 02:29:49,630
Beep!

2963
02:29:52,650 --> 02:29:53,910
Is it in between?

2964
02:29:56,090 --> 02:29:56,610
No.

2965
02:29:57,370 --> 02:29:57,470
No.

2966
02:29:59,390 --> 02:29:59,910
No.

2967
02:30:00,370 --> 02:30:00,890
No.

2968
02:30:07,140 --> 02:30:09,200
All that just to die anyway.

2969
02:30:13,060 --> 02:30:14,920
Same method as the last level.

2970
02:30:15,220 --> 02:30:15,360
Same method as the last level.

2971
02:30:15,780 --> 02:30:17,200
So I blow myself up?

2972
02:30:23,800 --> 02:30:24,540
Are you sure?

2973
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:24,820
Are you sure?

2974
02:30:25,960 --> 02:30:28,600
Maybe I blow myself up in the...

2975
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:31,960
Hold on.

2976
02:30:32,180 --> 02:30:33,100
Like in this area?

2977
02:30:37,800 --> 02:30:38,400
Here?

2978
02:30:39,560 --> 02:30:40,420
Blow up!

2979
02:30:40,960 --> 02:30:41,260
Blow

2980
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:47,720
up.

2981
02:30:54,320 --> 02:30:55,520
No, no.

2982
02:30:57,520 --> 02:30:59,220
Not to you!

2983
02:30:59,300 --> 02:31:00,020
I don't want to die to you!

2984
02:31:03,020 --> 02:31:04,220
Not to you!

2985
02:31:04,220 --> 02:31:04,220
I don't want to die to you!

2986
02:31:04,220 --> 02:31:04,300
Yeah!

2987
02:31:17,790 --> 02:31:20,110
How is someone from the 80s supposed to figure this out?

2988
02:31:21,190 --> 02:31:25,090
Back in the day, people actually used guidebooks.

2989
02:31:28,070 --> 02:31:29,770
And like strategy things.

2990
02:31:31,190 --> 02:31:37,630
There were some games that you could not beat unless you had an actual strategy book to use.

2991
02:31:38,530 --> 02:31:39,930
And took notes.

2992
02:31:40,030 --> 02:31:40,690
Yeah!

2993
02:31:41,710 --> 02:31:42,090
Okay.

2994
02:31:43,730 --> 02:31:44,250
Okay.

2995
02:31:44,670 --> 02:31:45,190
Okay.

2996
02:31:45,190 --> 02:31:45,190
Maybe.

2997
02:31:45,890 --> 02:31:46,410
Oh.

2998
02:31:46,550 --> 02:31:47,070
Maybe.

2999
02:31:49,770 --> 02:31:52,110
But I'm not even like dying to my own...

3000
02:31:52,110 --> 02:31:52,290
Oh!

3001
02:31:55,550 --> 02:31:56,990
I take it back.

3002
02:31:57,250 --> 02:31:59,250
I am dying to my own thing.

3003
02:31:59,450 --> 02:31:59,770
Ow!

3004
02:32:00,290 --> 02:32:00,470
Oh!

3005
02:32:02,690 --> 02:32:04,290
Alright, go down bug.

3006
02:32:04,430 --> 02:32:04,830
Ow!

3007
02:32:18,480 --> 02:32:19,560
To a specific spot.

3008
02:32:19,820 --> 02:32:22,380
But before I wasn't even dying to my own bombs.

3009
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:25,360
So I also have to specifically die.

3010
02:32:26,780 --> 02:32:28,780
I won't know what the spot is.

3011
02:32:29,320 --> 02:32:31,120
Unless I die on the spot.

3012
02:32:33,100 --> 02:32:35,320
Oh, that's the most frustrating part about it.

3013
02:32:37,700 --> 02:32:38,220
Okay.

3014
02:32:50,690 --> 02:32:51,710
Skill issue.

3015
02:32:51,870 --> 02:32:52,870
Just die better.

3016
02:32:53,750 --> 02:32:54,730
Why aren't you...

3017
02:32:54,730 --> 02:32:56,170
Why aren't you dying, idiot?

3018
02:32:59,370 --> 02:32:59,850
Okay.

3019
02:33:01,430 --> 02:33:02,950
Do you have a game genie?

3020
02:33:04,050 --> 02:33:06,150
No, I never had a game genie.

3021
02:33:08,150 --> 02:33:08,630
Oops.

3022
02:33:10,570 --> 02:33:11,050
Oops.

3023
02:33:13,710 --> 02:33:14,190
Anyway.

3024
02:33:16,250 --> 02:33:16,730
Anyway.

3025
02:33:21,830 --> 02:33:22,310
Wait.

3026
02:33:22,310 --> 02:33:23,110
Oh my god!

3027
02:33:23,150 --> 02:33:24,250
That guy came from the water!

3028
02:33:28,070 --> 02:33:28,550
Nasty!

3029
02:33:30,530 --> 02:33:31,010
Oh!

3030
02:33:33,860 --> 02:33:34,880
I did it again.

3031
02:33:35,060 --> 02:33:36,020
I did this last time too.

3032
02:33:41,060 --> 02:33:42,660
To be fair, you're so bad at it.

3033
02:33:42,700 --> 02:33:43,320
You came back twice.

3034
02:33:43,460 --> 02:33:43,700
Yeah!

3035
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:44,320
Yeah!

3036
02:33:44,540 --> 02:33:44,920
Yeah!

3037
02:33:45,460 --> 02:33:47,620
Let's see your play through Emmanuel.

3038
02:33:48,140 --> 02:33:48,560
Huh?

3039
02:33:50,560 --> 02:33:51,040
Yeah!

3040
02:33:51,220 --> 02:33:51,660
Yeah!

3041
02:33:51,780 --> 02:33:52,180
Yeah!

3042
02:33:54,320 --> 02:33:56,360
It's just finding the door.

3043
02:33:56,800 --> 02:33:57,280
Oh!

3044
02:34:02,460 --> 02:34:04,720
I tried falling down the hole in the bridge.

3045
02:34:05,660 --> 02:34:06,840
I think I'll just die.

3046
02:34:07,320 --> 02:34:08,800
I don't think I'll go anywhere.

3047
02:34:11,980 --> 02:34:12,460
Yeah!

3048
02:34:16,580 --> 02:34:18,120
I think I'll just die.

3049
02:34:20,500 --> 02:34:21,240
Oh my god.

3050
02:34:21,300 --> 02:34:21,500
Run!

3051
02:34:21,560 --> 02:34:21,660
Run!

3052
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:21,920
Run!

3053
02:34:21,980 --> 02:34:22,120
Run!

3054
02:34:22,480 --> 02:34:22,880
Wait.

3055
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:25,860
There we go.

3056
02:34:29,580 --> 02:34:30,240
So what?

3057
02:34:30,280 --> 02:34:31,460
Maybe I do die here.

3058
02:34:32,520 --> 02:34:33,000
Okay.

3059
02:34:33,040 --> 02:34:33,400
Hold on.

3060
02:34:34,740 --> 02:34:37,000
Let's try every corner of this bridge.

3061
02:34:55,130 --> 02:34:55,810
Oh no.

3062
02:34:56,370 --> 02:34:57,170
Oh no no no.

3063
02:34:57,290 --> 02:34:57,710
Oh no.

3064
02:34:58,130 --> 02:34:58,690
Oh no.

3065
02:34:59,170 --> 02:34:59,570
Okay.

3066
02:34:59,610 --> 02:35:00,190
This is a platform.

3067
02:35:00,390 --> 02:35:00,530
Okay.

3068
02:35:00,670 --> 02:35:01,230
Oh wow.

3069
02:35:01,310 --> 02:35:02,030
There's a lot of guys here.

3070
02:35:02,170 --> 02:35:02,370
Okay.

3071
02:35:02,850 --> 02:35:03,650
Let's go up.

3072
02:35:03,750 --> 02:35:04,290
And up.

3073
02:35:05,230 --> 02:35:05,850
And up.

3074
02:35:05,910 --> 02:35:06,110
Pshew!

3075
02:35:08,030 --> 02:35:08,430
Pshew!

3076
02:35:10,530 --> 02:35:10,930
Pshew!

3077
02:35:11,630 --> 02:35:12,030
Okay.

3078
02:35:14,010 --> 02:35:14,410
Alright.

3079
02:35:16,470 --> 02:35:16,870
Okay.

3080
02:35:16,950 --> 02:35:17,270
Nice.

3081
02:35:17,350 --> 02:35:17,530
Nice.

3082
02:35:17,550 --> 02:35:17,770
Nice.

3083
02:35:17,770 --> 02:35:17,970
Nice.

3084
02:35:17,990 --> 02:35:18,110
Nice.

3085
02:35:18,830 --> 02:35:19,230
Duck.

3086
02:35:20,110 --> 02:35:21,070
Actually I'm gonna go up.

3087
02:35:22,470 --> 02:35:24,450
Oh these guys stick to the ceiling!

3088
02:35:24,830 --> 02:35:25,670
Oh no.

3089
02:35:25,770 --> 02:35:26,030
No.

3090
02:35:26,150 --> 02:35:26,430
No.

3091
02:35:28,130 --> 02:35:28,890
Oh my god.

3092
02:35:28,950 --> 02:35:29,470
Oh my god.

3093
02:35:29,490 --> 02:35:30,090
That was so close.

3094
02:35:31,110 --> 02:35:31,550
Door!

3095
02:35:31,910 --> 02:35:32,290
Wait.

3096
02:35:32,370 --> 02:35:33,230
But is this THE door?

3097
02:35:34,250 --> 02:35:34,690
Wait.

3098
02:35:37,390 --> 02:35:37,830
93rd!

3099
02:35:38,990 --> 02:35:39,430
93rd!

3100
02:35:44,090 --> 02:35:44,630
Uh oh.

3101
02:35:46,270 --> 02:35:46,850
Uh oh.

3102
02:35:46,970 --> 02:35:49,710
I think I have to blow myself up here.

3103
02:35:51,290 --> 02:35:51,730
No.

3104
02:35:51,830 --> 02:35:52,170
I do not.

3105
02:35:52,190 --> 02:35:52,790
Oh my god.

3106
02:35:52,870 --> 02:35:53,510
Oh my god.

3107
02:35:53,550 --> 02:35:53,890
Oh my god.

3108
02:35:53,930 --> 02:35:55,370
I almost ruined it.

3109
02:35:55,430 --> 02:35:56,150
I almost ruined it.

3110
02:36:01,250 --> 02:36:01,650
96th!

3111
02:36:09,420 --> 02:36:09,820
Mommy!

3112
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:13,120
Mommy!

3113
02:36:24,210 --> 02:36:24,610
Die.

3114
02:36:24,610 --> 02:36:25,150
Oh no.

3115
02:36:25,230 --> 02:36:25,390
Mommy.

3116
02:36:25,490 --> 02:36:25,750
Mommy.

3117
02:36:25,790 --> 02:36:26,210
Mommy real.

3118
02:36:26,330 --> 02:36:26,770
Mommy real.

3119
02:36:27,390 --> 02:36:28,130
Mommy real.

3120
02:36:28,390 --> 02:36:29,030
Mommy real.

3121
02:36:31,270 --> 02:36:31,990
Die, mommy.

3122
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:36,900
Die, mommy.

3123
02:36:36,900 --> 02:36:36,900
Oh.

3124
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:38,320
Mommy real, mommy real!

3125
02:36:38,400 --> 02:36:38,580
Oh.

3126
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:38,780
Mommy real, mommy real!

3127
02:36:38,820 --> 02:36:38,920
Oh.

3128
02:36:39,440 --> 02:36:40,360
Mommy real, mommy real!

3129
02:36:45,260 --> 02:36:46,940
I don't know what I just got, but.

3130
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:48,240
Okay.

3131
02:36:48,420 --> 02:36:48,740
Mommy!

3132
02:36:50,020 --> 02:36:50,420
Mommy!

3133
02:36:57,340 --> 02:36:58,640
These guys are so cute!

3134
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:00,200
These guys are so cute!

3135
02:37:00,200 --> 02:37:00,200
Sorry.

3136
02:37:00,540 --> 02:37:00,940
Mommy.

3137
02:37:01,080 --> 02:37:01,260
Sorry.

3138
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:02,240
Mommy.

3139
02:37:07,640 --> 02:37:08,040
Mommy.

3140
02:37:08,040 --> 02:37:08,160
Mommy.

3141
02:37:13,400 --> 02:37:14,780
Just an enemy rush?

3142
02:37:14,940 --> 02:37:15,360
I guess so.

3143
02:37:16,860 --> 02:37:17,580
I should've...

3144
02:37:18,180 --> 02:37:18,820
My bad.

3145
02:37:18,980 --> 02:37:19,460
Oh well.

3146
02:37:22,540 --> 02:37:22,940
Please.

3147
02:37:23,700 --> 02:37:25,320
I feel like I'm gonna run out of time.

3148
02:37:28,720 --> 02:37:30,220
Oh, we're almost out of the tunnel.

3149
02:37:30,300 --> 02:37:31,280
We're almost out of the tunnel!

3150
02:37:31,800 --> 02:37:32,660
We're almost out!

3151
02:37:33,940 --> 02:37:34,340
Okay.

3152
02:37:34,340 --> 02:37:34,740
Alright.

3153
02:37:38,040 --> 02:37:39,420
I probably didn't need to do that.

3154
02:37:39,560 --> 02:37:40,900
But I was nervous, okay?

3155
02:37:42,300 --> 02:37:43,400
Don't risk it.

3156
02:37:43,500 --> 02:37:44,320
Don't... 98!

3157
02:37:45,980 --> 02:37:47,180
Don't risk it!

3158
02:37:48,660 --> 02:37:49,880
What is that?

3159
02:37:53,940 --> 02:37:54,680
Oh my gosh.

3160
02:38:01,500 --> 02:38:02,580
What is it though?

3161
02:38:04,300 --> 02:38:05,540
Where do I go here?

3162
02:38:06,480 --> 02:38:07,520
Okay, here?

3163
02:38:10,540 --> 02:38:11,060
Nice.

3164
02:38:13,080 --> 02:38:13,700
Here?

3165
02:38:18,400 --> 02:38:19,040
Okay...

3166
02:38:20,380 --> 02:38:22,700
I'm not quite sure how this...

3167
02:38:23,660 --> 02:38:27,060
I see stuff over there, but I can't see anything.

3168
02:38:29,160 --> 02:38:30,440
The momentum!

3169
02:38:35,640 --> 02:38:37,520
Oh god, this stage.

3170
02:38:41,640 --> 02:38:43,740
Is it like an invisible floor or something?

3171
02:38:45,540 --> 02:38:46,140
No...

3172
02:38:47,780 --> 02:38:48,380
No...

3173
02:38:48,380 --> 02:38:48,700
Okay.

3174
02:38:50,940 --> 02:38:52,880
What do you mean a graphical error?

3175
02:38:54,060 --> 02:38:56,240
What do you mean a graphical error?

3176
02:38:57,760 --> 02:38:59,100
Don't overthink it!

3177
02:39:04,280 --> 02:39:06,220
Wait, so do I go to... which...

3178
02:39:06,820 --> 02:39:08,700
It's the treasure chest wraparound.

3179
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:09,660
Oh, okay, okay.

3180
02:39:17,170 --> 02:39:18,850
You can just...

3181
02:39:18,850 --> 02:39:19,610
You can jump.

3182
02:39:21,150 --> 02:39:23,050
Oh, there's not anything on the right side.

3183
02:39:23,310 --> 02:39:25,950
Oh, shoot.

3184
02:39:40,720 --> 02:39:41,600
No way.

3185
02:39:42,180 --> 02:39:43,360
Am I trapped in here?

3186
02:39:46,180 --> 02:39:47,220
I see.

3187
02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:50,780
I see.

3188
02:39:51,340 --> 02:39:52,340
I see.

3189
02:39:52,940 --> 02:39:56,270
I see.

3190
02:39:56,650 --> 02:39:58,150
Oh my god, that was so close.

3191
02:39:58,270 --> 02:39:58,970
That was so close.

3192
02:39:59,350 --> 02:39:59,870
Hiyup!

3193
02:39:59,870 --> 02:39:59,950
Hiyup!

3194
02:40:01,770 --> 02:40:02,130
Okay.

3195
02:40:08,980 --> 02:40:09,840
Slow and steady.

3196
02:40:23,490 --> 02:40:24,370
Don't fall, don't fall!

3197
02:40:24,890 --> 02:40:25,250
Nice!

3198
02:40:28,230 --> 02:40:28,590
Okay.

3199
02:40:29,970 --> 02:40:30,330
Um...

3200
02:40:31,270 --> 02:40:31,630
Oh!

3201
02:40:40,290 --> 02:40:40,870
Wait, hello?

3202
02:40:42,190 --> 02:40:42,850
Okay, there we go.

3203
02:40:44,110 --> 02:40:44,470
Oh!

3204
02:40:45,230 --> 02:40:46,190
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

3205
02:40:46,890 --> 02:40:47,770
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

3206
02:40:47,890 --> 02:40:48,950
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

3207
02:40:49,630 --> 02:40:50,430
Okay, okay, okay.

3208
02:40:51,950 --> 02:40:52,270
Nice.

3209
02:40:52,530 --> 02:40:53,330
Just one more, mommy.

3210
02:40:58,280 --> 02:40:59,620
I hope I'm going the right way.

3211
02:40:59,900 --> 02:41:00,400
Oh, no!

3212
02:41:00,440 --> 02:41:01,320
They're coming from this way too!

3213
02:41:02,060 --> 02:41:02,640
Okay, okay.

3214
02:41:02,660 --> 02:41:03,060
Run, run, run.

3215
02:41:09,580 --> 02:41:09,900
Okay.

3216
02:41:10,660 --> 02:41:11,260
Oh my gosh.

3217
02:41:11,400 --> 02:41:11,680
Please.

3218
02:41:19,150 --> 02:41:23,470
It would have been really sad if I had died to that bat.

3219
02:41:26,250 --> 02:41:28,330
I can't tell if I can jump over these guys or not.

3220
02:41:28,330 --> 02:41:31,150
But I'm not going to risk it.

3221
02:41:31,730 --> 02:41:32,790
It's a lot of mummies.

3222
02:41:32,870 --> 02:41:34,790
It's so many mummies!

3223
02:41:35,290 --> 02:41:36,210
Get out of here!

3224
02:41:36,290 --> 02:41:37,350
Oh, no, no, no, no!

3225
02:41:37,610 --> 02:41:38,330
Oh my god.

3226
02:41:38,350 --> 02:41:39,070
No, no, no, no!

3227
02:41:42,270 --> 02:41:43,010
Oh my god.

3228
02:41:47,500 --> 02:41:48,680
Go away, mummy!

3229
02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:51,060
I hope I don't even know if I'm going the right way.

3230
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:53,680
I don't even know if I'm going the right way.

3231
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:56,080
Okay.

3232
02:41:57,140 --> 02:41:57,680
All right.

3233
02:41:58,700 --> 02:41:59,100
Onwards.

3234
02:41:59,560 --> 02:41:59,960
Ever.

3235
02:41:59,960 --> 02:42:00,960
Atlantis, no nazzle!

3236
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:09,340
Atlantis, your nazzle will be solved by my hands and my brain.

3237
02:42:09,860 --> 02:42:10,440
Oh my gosh.

3238
02:42:14,780 --> 02:42:16,280
Oh, I'm going to run out of time.

3239
02:42:16,520 --> 02:42:16,880
Okay.

3240
02:42:16,920 --> 02:42:18,080
I think I have to risk it.

3241
02:42:18,700 --> 02:42:19,600
I have to risk it.

3242
02:42:24,060 --> 02:42:24,660
Oh my god.

3243
02:42:25,900 --> 02:42:26,520
You know what?

3244
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:26,920
It's fine.

3245
02:42:27,440 --> 02:42:28,920
I ran out of time anyway.

3246
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:31,480
Is your rage meter still at zero?

3247
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:31,840
Zero percent?

3248
02:42:32,060 --> 02:42:33,640
Yeah, actually, I'm feeling not so bad.

3249
02:42:34,900 --> 02:42:35,680
Oh my god.

3250
02:42:37,160 --> 02:42:37,900
Poop bat!

3251
02:42:42,040 --> 02:42:45,520
Sometimes they're like glitching on the sides and it's freaking me out.

3252
02:42:46,340 --> 02:42:47,520
Where's all the mummies at?

3253
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:49,440
What the hell is this?

3254
02:42:50,180 --> 02:42:51,560
Where are all the mummies at?

3255
02:42:55,820 --> 02:42:56,300
Yippee!

3256
02:42:58,140 --> 02:42:59,240
Oh, there they are.

3257
02:43:05,160 --> 02:43:06,260
That looks suspicious.

3258
02:43:07,100 --> 02:43:07,580
Where?

3259
02:43:07,580 --> 02:43:09,060
That looks suspicious.

3260
02:43:09,380 --> 02:43:11,620
Oh my god, oh my god!

3261
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:12,940
Wait, please!

3262
02:43:14,440 --> 02:43:15,120
Wait,

3263
02:43:21,520 --> 02:43:22,340
what's that door up there?

3264
02:43:32,180 --> 02:43:33,280
Yikes, okay.

3265
02:43:37,670 --> 02:43:41,450
Oh my god, the timing is... oh my god.

3266
02:43:50,320 --> 02:43:51,480
You have to be speed, Minto.

3267
02:43:54,140 --> 02:43:55,540
What if I just jump over it?

3268
02:43:59,220 --> 02:44:00,920
I only have two lives left.

3269
02:44:01,300 --> 02:44:02,520
Can you duck and bomb?

3270
02:44:03,080 --> 02:44:03,740
We'll see.

3271
02:44:16,150 --> 02:44:20,230
Oh my god, if I bomb, I sit up so I get hit!

3272
02:44:21,230 --> 02:44:22,710
Oh my god, no way.

3273
02:44:23,570 --> 02:44:24,330
Okay, hold on.

3274
02:44:26,870 --> 02:44:28,610
He shoots both ways!

3275
02:44:32,950 --> 02:44:34,990
Is that even possible to do?

3276
02:44:40,670 --> 02:44:42,490
I don't even think that's possible.

3277
02:44:42,690 --> 02:44:45,030
How am I supposed to jump and duck at the same time?

3278
02:44:45,390 --> 02:44:46,190
It is?

3279
02:44:46,230 --> 02:44:46,790
It's possible?

3280
02:44:54,690 --> 02:44:55,910
Yes, but it's hard.

3281
02:44:56,990 --> 02:45:02,530
Oh my god, even the AI dies on level 10.

3282
02:45:03,850 --> 02:45:06,530
This room is insanely precise to do without a power-up.

3283
02:45:06,730 --> 02:45:09,130
Code only did it, but it took many attempts to memorize.

3284
02:45:09,850 --> 02:45:10,330
Okay.

3285
02:45:14,160 --> 02:45:15,880
So now we have two options here.

3286
02:45:17,220 --> 02:45:18,960
Now we have two options here.

3287
02:45:19,780 --> 02:45:21,440
We can either...

3288
02:45:22,900 --> 02:45:24,160
We can either...

3289
02:45:24,160 --> 02:45:25,380
Where's my strategy guide?

3290
02:45:25,860 --> 02:45:28,280
We can either go that route...

3291
02:45:29,120 --> 02:45:29,680
Which...

3292
02:45:29,680 --> 02:45:34,220
Now that I know how to get past 52nd...

3293
02:45:34,980 --> 02:45:36,040
It's not so bad.

3294
02:45:36,800 --> 02:45:41,260
It's not so bad getting past it and getting to the rest of it.

3295
02:45:41,260 --> 02:45:44,360
It would be the 100th that would be the most difficult.

3296
02:45:46,320 --> 02:45:46,880
But...

3297
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:49,460
There's also this invincibility route.

3298
02:45:49,620 --> 02:45:52,060
But that also involves going through 8.

3299
02:45:52,300 --> 02:45:53,280
Which isn't...

3300
02:45:53,280 --> 02:45:54,960
In theory, I guess, so bad.

3301
02:45:55,060 --> 02:45:55,580
But 10!

3302
02:46:04,290 --> 02:46:07,970
10 is where we would really struggle, I think.

3303
02:46:08,730 --> 02:46:09,630
I say we.

3304
02:46:09,790 --> 02:46:10,750
It's really just me.

3305
02:46:13,310 --> 02:46:14,990
You'll get better at 8 and 10?

3306
02:46:15,270 --> 02:46:16,110
You think so?

3307
02:46:18,410 --> 02:46:19,930
10 was the trees and the clouds?

3308
02:46:19,990 --> 02:46:20,190
Yeah.

3309
02:46:20,270 --> 02:46:21,770
10 was the trees and the clouds.

3310
02:46:22,390 --> 02:46:24,310
And then I don't even know what's beyond there.

3311
02:46:25,050 --> 02:46:26,850
But it's the invincibility route.

3312
02:46:26,970 --> 02:46:27,430
So...

3313
02:46:27,430 --> 02:46:28,770
I'm assuming...

3314
02:46:28,770 --> 02:46:30,230
The star...

3315
02:46:30,770 --> 02:46:31,750
Makes us invincible.

3316
02:46:33,250 --> 02:46:34,170
Against enemies.

3317
02:46:46,920 --> 02:46:48,280
I'll make a poll.

3318
02:46:53,180 --> 02:46:54,340
Which route...

3319
02:46:54,340 --> 02:46:56,880
Which seat should I take?

3320
02:46:58,060 --> 02:46:59,420
Which route...

3321
02:46:59,420 --> 02:47:00,360
Should we take?

3322
02:47:01,400 --> 02:47:02,280
Route...

3323
02:47:02,280 --> 02:47:03,480
10.

3324
02:47:04,020 --> 02:47:05,480
Actually, I'll say...

3325
02:47:05,480 --> 02:47:06,480
Route...

3326
02:47:06,480 --> 02:47:07,460
Invinci...

3327
02:47:08,280 --> 02:47:09,560
Route 10.

3328
02:47:10,120 --> 02:47:11,400
Route 100.

3329
02:47:11,620 --> 02:47:12,260
I guess that's it.

3330
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:13,580
I guess those are our most difficult ones.

3331
02:47:16,320 --> 02:47:16,880
Nagoya.

3332
02:47:17,140 --> 02:47:17,660
No!

3333
02:47:26,460 --> 02:47:27,360
Harem route.

3334
02:47:28,740 --> 02:47:29,700
I wish.

3335
02:47:32,420 --> 02:47:34,840
I don't mind trying 10 a couple more times.

3336
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:35,600
But like...

3337
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:37,580
How long of a route...

3338
02:47:37,580 --> 02:47:38,740
How long is it?

3339
02:47:38,800 --> 02:47:39,060
You know?

3340
02:47:40,700 --> 02:47:41,600
I'm scared.

3341
02:47:42,320 --> 02:47:43,780
Why is it 50-50?

3342
02:47:46,820 --> 02:47:48,180
What's wrong with you guys?

3343
02:47:49,100 --> 02:47:51,040
Which path leads to Akihabara?

3344
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:54,260
I don't know.

3345
02:47:57,560 --> 02:47:59,660
The route is a 10, but it's impossible.

3346
02:48:01,640 --> 02:48:03,120
Route 100 is winning.

3347
02:48:04,200 --> 02:48:05,980
Are there two different level 100?

3348
02:48:06,440 --> 02:48:08,180
I don't know, actually.

3349
02:48:09,640 --> 02:48:11,020
I have no idea.

3350
02:48:11,220 --> 02:48:12,500
What is this level even?

3351
02:48:15,180 --> 02:48:17,720
There's so much of this game that I feel like...

3352
02:48:17,720 --> 02:48:17,980
Look!

3353
02:48:18,040 --> 02:48:18,160
Invinci!

3354
02:48:18,160 --> 02:48:18,340
88.

3355
02:48:18,520 --> 02:48:19,420
We also get a star.

3356
02:48:20,220 --> 02:48:22,640
There's so much of this game that we're skipping over.

3357
02:48:22,760 --> 02:48:23,320
But you know what?

3358
02:48:24,060 --> 02:48:24,500
Oh!

3359
02:48:24,620 --> 02:48:24,820
Oh!

3360
02:48:24,900 --> 02:48:25,060
Oh!

3361
02:48:25,060 --> 02:48:25,440
My bad.

3362
02:48:25,600 --> 02:48:26,540
The dark zone.

3363
02:48:28,380 --> 02:48:28,820
Wait.

3364
02:48:29,320 --> 02:48:30,120
I'm trying to...

3365
02:48:30,120 --> 02:48:31,360
What is the dark zone?

3366
02:48:33,040 --> 02:48:33,480
Ah!

3367
02:48:33,500 --> 02:48:34,160
Stop it!

3368
02:48:35,020 --> 02:48:35,900
I'm trying to read.

3369
02:48:40,600 --> 02:48:42,960
Dark zone and freeze zone.

3370
02:48:46,440 --> 02:48:46,880
Interesting.

3371
02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:48,120
Zone.

3372
02:48:48,140 --> 02:48:48,840
That is dark.

3373
02:48:52,920 --> 02:48:54,040
55%...

3374
02:48:54,040 --> 02:48:55,620
56% on route 100.

3375
02:49:02,230 --> 02:49:03,430
This is killing me.

3376
02:49:03,450 --> 02:49:04,590
I'm not even watching the screen.

3377
02:49:04,850 --> 02:49:09,950
But just hearing the game start and then he jumps and immediately dies is kind of sending me.

3378
02:49:11,830 --> 02:49:12,630
All right.

3379
02:49:13,050 --> 02:49:14,770
The mystery adventure starts.

3380
02:49:19,440 --> 02:49:20,000
Oh!

3381
02:49:23,080 --> 02:49:23,640
Oh!

3382
02:49:23,640 --> 02:49:24,080
Oh!

3383
02:49:24,640 --> 02:49:25,200
Oh!

3384
02:49:38,290 --> 02:49:40,150
I had to jump over that though.

3385
02:49:40,290 --> 02:49:41,530
I just got the timing wrong.

3386
02:49:45,210 --> 02:49:48,610
Sunsoft started doing stuff again and I hope they come back to this game.

3387
02:49:51,450 --> 02:49:51,930
Wow.

3388
02:49:53,590 --> 02:49:54,430
What are you?

3389
02:49:56,370 --> 02:49:57,330
A masochist?

3390
02:49:58,310 --> 02:49:58,790
I don't know.

3391
02:49:59,550 --> 02:50:00,030
I don't know.

3392
02:50:01,010 --> 02:50:05,990
Though it's kind of interesting seeing that it's like not...

3393
02:50:06,550 --> 02:50:07,470
Like you can...

3394
02:50:07,470 --> 02:50:10,170
I can only play this in the JP side, you know?

3395
02:50:10,310 --> 02:50:10,830
So...

3396
02:50:11,850 --> 02:50:12,370
Okay.

3397
02:50:13,050 --> 02:50:13,570
Oops.

3398
02:50:15,290 --> 02:50:16,330
Wrong way.

3399
02:50:16,730 --> 02:50:17,250
Okay.

3400
02:50:17,270 --> 02:50:19,290
Let's get some points so we can...

3401
02:50:19,930 --> 02:50:21,330
I think you get more health.

3402
02:50:21,610 --> 02:50:21,870
Yeah.

3403
02:50:21,910 --> 02:50:22,670
We're back to seven.

3404
02:50:22,850 --> 02:50:23,430
So awesome.

3405
02:50:25,830 --> 02:50:26,350
Okay.

3406
02:50:30,900 --> 02:50:31,420
Oh!

3407
02:50:31,500 --> 02:50:32,020
Um...

3408
02:50:32,020 --> 02:50:32,820
Okay.

3409
02:50:32,840 --> 02:50:33,500
My game...

3410
02:50:34,680 --> 02:50:36,400
Glitched for a second.

3411
02:50:39,240 --> 02:50:41,100
And now we know where to go.

3412
02:50:44,040 --> 02:50:45,900
So I'm not so scared.

3413
02:50:46,640 --> 02:50:48,200
Just a little scared.

3414
02:50:48,820 --> 02:50:50,300
Just a little scared.

3415
02:50:52,800 --> 02:50:53,600
Uh...

3416
02:50:53,600 --> 02:50:55,200
Oh!

3417
02:50:55,880 --> 02:50:56,680
Uh...

3418
02:50:58,620 --> 02:50:59,580
Uh...

3419
02:50:59,580 --> 02:50:59,980
No!

3420
02:51:02,580 --> 02:51:03,380
Yippee!

3421
02:51:03,960 --> 02:51:04,760
Oh!

3422
02:51:07,630 --> 02:51:08,470
I went...

3423
02:51:08,470 --> 02:51:10,710
I'm so curious what those chests are.

3424
02:51:13,570 --> 02:51:14,050
Oh!

3425
02:51:14,050 --> 02:51:14,270
Okay.

3426
02:51:14,330 --> 02:51:14,870
I remember this one.

3427
02:51:19,090 --> 02:51:19,570
Uh...

3428
02:51:19,570 --> 02:51:19,930
Oh!

3429
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:20,570
Oh!

3430
02:51:20,590 --> 02:51:21,070
Don't...

3431
02:51:21,070 --> 02:51:21,390
Don't...

3432
02:51:21,390 --> 02:51:21,590
Don't...

3433
02:51:21,590 --> 02:51:22,250
Don't poop on me.

3434
02:51:24,050 --> 02:51:26,550
I can't tell if I'm killing anything or...

3435
02:51:26,550 --> 02:51:27,170
Hoopa-pa-pa-pa-pa.

3436
02:51:28,770 --> 02:51:29,250
Oh!

3437
02:51:32,350 --> 02:51:32,830
Oh!

3438
02:51:32,910 --> 02:51:33,390
Oh!

3439
02:51:33,390 --> 02:51:33,570
Oh!

3440
02:51:33,590 --> 02:51:34,070
Oh!

3441
02:51:34,350 --> 02:51:34,450
Oh!

3442
02:51:34,450 --> 02:51:34,710
Oh!

3443
02:51:34,930 --> 02:51:34,990
Oh!

3444
02:51:34,990 --> 02:51:35,090
Oh!

3445
02:51:35,470 --> 02:51:35,950
Oh!

3446
02:51:35,950 --> 02:51:37,170
I don't know how I live.

3447
02:51:37,790 --> 02:51:39,230
I don't know how I...

3448
02:51:39,230 --> 02:51:40,140
How I live.

3449
02:51:40,650 --> 02:51:42,790
I don't know how I live.

3450
02:51:43,170 --> 02:51:43,390
Okay.

3451
02:51:44,170 --> 02:51:44,750
Oh!

3452
02:51:49,320 --> 02:51:49,900
Sheesh!

3453
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:52,580
Okay.

3454
02:51:53,920 --> 02:51:55,960
And here we blow up.

3455
02:51:59,500 --> 02:52:00,660
Easy peasy.

3456
02:52:05,960 --> 02:52:07,140
What was this one again?

3457
02:52:07,360 --> 02:52:07,700
Oh!

3458
02:52:07,780 --> 02:52:08,220
Mommy!

3459
02:52:09,020 --> 02:52:09,600
Oh!

3460
02:52:12,320 --> 02:52:12,760
Okay.

3461
02:52:14,540 --> 02:52:14,560
Okay.

3462
02:52:15,480 --> 02:52:15,920
Okay.

3463
02:52:15,920 --> 02:52:16,460
Mommy time.

3464
02:52:24,650 --> 02:52:26,030
This one we just keep running.

3465
02:52:29,470 --> 02:52:29,910
Mommy!

3466
02:52:31,910 --> 02:52:34,470
Have you ever played La Mulana?

3467
02:52:37,930 --> 02:52:38,730
Oh my gosh.

3468
02:52:38,850 --> 02:52:39,630
I need to pay attention.

3469
02:52:39,830 --> 02:52:43,170
It sounds familiar, but I've never played it before.

3470
02:52:45,310 --> 02:52:46,850
Maybe if I saw it, I would know.

3471
02:52:55,670 --> 02:52:56,590
Oh, cute!

3472
02:53:04,860 --> 02:53:08,540
There was like another game that I'm... Oh my god, wait.

3473
02:53:08,680 --> 02:53:09,400
Oh my god, wait.

3474
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:11,580
What?

3475
02:53:16,440 --> 02:53:17,620
Are you kidding me?

3476
02:53:19,340 --> 02:53:22,440
Since when could you throw fireballs?

3477
02:53:26,200 --> 02:53:29,700
Since when could you throw fireballs at me?

3478
02:53:32,380 --> 02:53:35,040
He just pulled out a gun.

3479
02:53:35,400 --> 02:53:36,240
Yo!

3480
02:53:38,080 --> 02:53:38,980
Messed up!

3481
02:53:43,700 --> 02:53:46,300
He said call an ambulance.

3482
02:53:47,620 --> 02:53:48,240
Not for me.

3483
02:53:54,490 --> 02:53:59,450
Can you imagine if you couldn't move while the bomb was deployed too?

3484
02:54:00,630 --> 02:54:03,110
How much more difficult can we make this game?

3485
02:54:05,530 --> 02:54:07,770
There's a second version of mummies with ranged attacks.

3486
02:54:08,130 --> 02:54:10,190
And they look the exact same!

3487
02:54:12,530 --> 02:54:14,630
There's no distinction between them!

3488
02:54:15,090 --> 02:54:20,270
Before, I think I just was able to run past him, so I didn't even pay him any...

3489
02:54:28,740 --> 02:54:32,160
I think he was in a different spot before, so I didn't have to pay him any mind.

3490
02:54:35,840 --> 02:54:36,420
Uh oh.

3491
02:54:36,700 --> 02:54:42,300
I think the less creatures that are in the front, the more that are in the tube.

3492
02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:54,300
Okay, we didn't struggle before because the RNG was on our side, but...

3493
02:54:54,880 --> 02:54:57,040
I have faith we can get through this as well.

3494
02:54:57,240 --> 02:54:58,780
Even though we're wasting a little bit of lives.

3495
02:54:58,960 --> 02:55:01,280
I just have to get used to this new zombie fellow.

3496
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:03,320
You know, our new mummy friend.

3497
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:04,840
With his gun.

3498
02:55:08,580 --> 02:55:12,160
They only shoot fireballs if they hit a ledge.

3499
02:55:15,900 --> 02:55:18,660
They're like, hey, I'm not attacking you enough.

3500
02:55:21,140 --> 02:55:24,520
I really gotta... I really gotta get you good.

3501
02:55:25,440 --> 02:55:28,020
Are they supposed to be scorpions, or...

3502
02:55:34,980 --> 02:55:35,740
Oh my gosh.

3503
02:55:36,980 --> 02:55:37,500
Wait.

3504
02:55:38,600 --> 02:55:39,740
There we go.

3505
02:55:46,720 --> 02:55:47,240
Earwigs.

3506
02:55:47,240 --> 02:55:48,640
Oh, gross!

3507
02:55:50,380 --> 02:55:50,900
Shoo.

3508
02:55:50,920 --> 02:55:51,260
Oh.

3509
02:55:51,480 --> 02:55:52,000
Shoo.

3510
02:55:54,520 --> 02:55:56,180
I wonder if it's worth getting that.

3511
02:56:01,460 --> 02:56:01,900
Oh!

3512
02:56:03,360 --> 02:56:05,160
I didn't know there were some guys up here.

3513
02:56:09,920 --> 02:56:10,360
Okay.

3514
02:56:12,500 --> 02:56:13,500
Slow and steady.

3515
02:56:17,860 --> 02:56:18,300
Why?

3516
02:56:19,780 --> 02:56:22,040
Sometimes he doesn't fall off the ledge.

3517
02:56:22,100 --> 02:56:22,280
Ow!

3518
02:56:22,400 --> 02:56:23,000
No, no, no, no, no.

3519
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:24,100
I almost blew myself up.

3520
02:56:25,440 --> 02:56:28,860
Sometimes he doesn't walk off the ledge, and sometimes he's just like...

3521
02:56:29,720 --> 02:56:31,080
Sometimes he's just like, yup.

3522
02:56:31,420 --> 02:56:31,860
Oh.

3523
02:56:32,740 --> 02:56:33,980
I'm just gonna keep going.

3524
02:56:34,480 --> 02:56:35,000
What?

3525
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:35,440
Why?

3526
02:56:36,480 --> 02:56:41,040
You saw last time I was able to do it by just kind of inching my way over.

3527
02:56:41,560 --> 02:56:42,680
What was the difference?

3528
02:56:46,600 --> 02:56:48,140
What was the difference?

3529
02:56:49,440 --> 02:56:50,640
Walk the other direction?

3530
02:56:50,700 --> 02:56:52,060
I think when you're falling...

3531
02:56:52,060 --> 02:56:53,020
Oh my gosh.

3532
02:56:54,480 --> 02:56:55,000
Okay.

3533
02:56:56,520 --> 02:56:57,300
There we go.

3534
02:56:57,760 --> 02:56:58,600
99th zone!

3535
02:57:01,300 --> 02:57:01,860
Okay.

3536
02:57:02,960 --> 02:57:03,520
Oh.

3537
02:57:03,640 --> 02:57:05,160
I can jump over these guys.

3538
02:57:16,210 --> 02:57:17,050
Just kidding.

3539
02:57:17,770 --> 02:57:19,130
How many lives do I have left?

3540
02:57:19,170 --> 02:57:19,570
Only five!

3541
02:57:22,250 --> 02:57:23,250
She's silly.

3542
02:57:23,330 --> 02:57:24,150
I love her.

3543
02:57:27,890 --> 02:57:29,630
Thank you for the donut.

3544
02:57:30,310 --> 02:57:30,870
Shoo.

3545
02:57:32,930 --> 02:57:33,490
Shoo.

3546
02:57:35,550 --> 02:57:39,830
Do you guys think that making sound effects enhances your gaming ability?

3547
02:57:40,230 --> 02:57:41,510
Because I believe it does.

3548
02:57:42,150 --> 02:57:42,970
For me.

3549
02:57:43,310 --> 02:57:43,950
Personally.

3550
02:57:44,790 --> 02:57:45,550
You know.

3551
02:57:45,730 --> 02:57:48,370
I believe it allows me to go further.

3552
02:57:48,850 --> 02:57:49,490
Beyond.

3553
02:57:55,610 --> 02:57:56,250
Help!

3554
02:57:57,830 --> 02:57:58,470
Nevermind.

3555
02:57:58,470 --> 02:57:58,850
I know.

3556
02:58:03,100 --> 02:58:03,420
Yeah.

3557
02:58:04,960 --> 02:58:05,880
I'm going this way.

3558
02:58:16,080 --> 02:58:17,040
Don't poop on me.

3559
02:58:19,600 --> 02:58:19,920
Oh!

3560
02:58:21,840 --> 02:58:23,140
If I had just waited...

3561
02:58:23,140 --> 02:58:23,220
Oh.

3562
02:58:23,300 --> 02:58:23,520
Wait.

3563
02:58:23,960 --> 02:58:24,280
Oh.

3564
02:58:24,320 --> 02:58:25,400
They started throwing stuff.

3565
02:58:25,540 --> 02:58:26,100
Did you see that?

3566
02:58:26,540 --> 02:58:29,240
It would have actually been impossible to get there because...

3567
02:58:29,240 --> 02:58:29,360
Oh.

3568
02:58:29,420 --> 02:58:29,880
Not impossible.

3569
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:30,980
We would have just had to kill them.

3570
02:58:31,180 --> 02:58:31,860
Now that I think about it.

3571
02:58:31,900 --> 02:58:32,000
But.

3572
02:58:32,220 --> 02:58:32,540
Also.

3573
02:58:32,760 --> 02:58:34,860
We would have had to kill them while ducking the whole time.

3574
02:58:34,940 --> 02:58:37,500
And I can't duck and shoot at the same time.

3575
02:58:37,500 --> 02:58:40,500
Why is my RH so bad this time!?

3576
02:58:41,740 --> 02:58:42,180
Ok.

3577
02:58:45,140 --> 02:58:45,840
I'm fine.

3578
02:58:46,880 --> 02:58:47,660
I'm fine.

3579
02:58:47,680 --> 02:58:48,000
I'm fine.

3580
02:58:48,020 --> 02:58:48,420
I'm fine.

3581
02:58:49,100 --> 02:58:49,680
I'm fine.

3582
02:58:49,900 --> 02:58:50,180
I'm fine.

3583
02:58:50,280 --> 02:58:50,520
I'm fine.

3584
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:50,840
I'm fine.

3585
02:58:50,840 --> 02:58:50,860
I'm fine.

3586
02:59:11,270 --> 02:59:12,090
Let's go this way.

3587
02:59:16,570 --> 02:59:17,010
Oh!

3588
02:59:17,010 --> 02:59:17,110
Oh!

3589
02:59:17,450 --> 02:59:18,610
I pressed the wrong button.

3590
02:59:18,670 --> 02:59:19,290
That was my fault.

3591
02:59:19,390 --> 02:59:20,750
I think I'm going to game over, yeah.

3592
02:59:23,030 --> 02:59:25,270
Seems you had really good RNG in this level previously.

3593
02:59:25,470 --> 02:59:25,930
It's true!

3594
02:59:26,270 --> 02:59:26,770
It's true!

3595
02:59:26,990 --> 02:59:29,390
There was the second time that I went through and there was no zombies.

3596
02:59:29,890 --> 02:59:31,750
Battle cries definitely help enhance gameplay.

3597
02:59:32,690 --> 02:59:33,150
It's okay.

3598
02:59:52,190 --> 02:59:54,370
I don't think I want to go through zone 100.

3599
02:59:56,290 --> 02:59:57,810
You guys, I'm thinking about it.

3600
02:59:59,890 --> 03:00:01,970
I don't know if I want to go through zone 100.

3601
03:00:02,750 --> 03:00:04,270
Let's try zone 10 a little more.

3602
03:00:04,490 --> 03:00:06,630
I think I'm better with jumping now, right?

3603
03:00:07,730 --> 03:00:08,110
So...

3604
03:00:08,950 --> 03:00:09,710
I think...

3605
03:00:10,410 --> 03:00:11,910
I think I might be able to do it.

3606
03:00:12,050 --> 03:00:13,450
Wait, how do I... I go through 3.

3607
03:00:14,670 --> 03:00:16,450
And then I skip, right?

3608
03:00:16,550 --> 03:00:17,230
Is that what it was?

3609
03:00:17,430 --> 03:00:18,410
I can't remember actually.

3610
03:00:32,610 --> 03:00:33,830
We decided to go this way.

3611
03:00:37,350 --> 03:00:39,350
I go to 3 and then I go to...

3612
03:00:40,270 --> 03:00:41,810
Yes, because I got to get the boots at 6.

3613
03:00:42,570 --> 03:00:43,670
And this is fish.

3614
03:00:43,990 --> 03:00:44,870
Watch out for fish!

3615
03:00:46,090 --> 03:00:47,110
Watch out for fish.

3616
03:00:47,690 --> 03:00:48,550
Watch out for fish.

3617
03:00:49,050 --> 03:00:49,910
Watch out for fish.

3618
03:00:49,970 --> 03:00:50,430
Watch out for fish.

3619
03:00:59,500 --> 03:01:00,840
And it's this one.

3620
03:01:01,620 --> 03:01:03,020
This one right there.

3621
03:01:05,400 --> 03:01:05,760
Yippee!

3622
03:01:12,640 --> 03:01:12,800
Yippee!

3623
03:01:15,140 --> 03:01:16,120
8th zone.

3624
03:01:16,400 --> 03:01:18,160
Oh no, I forgot about the 8th zone.

3625
03:01:20,160 --> 03:01:21,540
Oh 8th zone.

3626
03:01:22,240 --> 03:01:24,140
8th zone, please be kind to me.

3627
03:01:27,850 --> 03:01:32,110
I think this zone is what has made me better at the game.

3628
03:01:32,230 --> 03:01:32,750
Truly.

3629
03:01:34,950 --> 03:01:35,990
Just mastering...

3630
03:01:35,990 --> 03:01:38,210
I can't say that I've mastered it.

3631
03:01:38,330 --> 03:01:43,870
But getting past this zone is what I think made me better at the game.

3632
03:01:44,650 --> 03:01:45,370
Okay.

3633
03:01:45,670 --> 03:01:46,390
Okay.

3634
03:01:48,090 --> 03:01:49,670
Oh my God.

3635
03:01:50,210 --> 03:01:53,010
I say as I die.

3636
03:01:55,550 --> 03:01:58,330
Oh, I hate Zone 8.

3637
03:01:58,470 --> 03:01:59,950
I hate Zone 8.

3638
03:02:00,110 --> 03:02:01,430
I hate Zone 8.

3639
03:02:01,470 --> 03:02:04,310
I hate Zone 8.

3640
03:02:04,330 --> 03:02:05,270
I hate Zone 8.

3641
03:02:05,270 --> 03:02:05,690
I hate Zone 8.

3642
03:02:06,290 --> 03:02:07,510
I hate it!

3643
03:02:07,510 --> 03:02:08,930
Why are there two of you?

3644
03:02:11,290 --> 03:02:12,870
I hate Zone 8.

3645
03:02:13,370 --> 03:02:14,090
I hate Zone 8.

3646
03:02:16,590 --> 03:02:17,730
Oh, that was a close one.

3647
03:02:21,510 --> 03:02:23,130
Oh, my bad.

3648
03:02:23,370 --> 03:02:25,490
I did not mean to... you know what?

3649
03:02:25,710 --> 03:02:26,310
That's fine.

3650
03:02:29,330 --> 03:02:30,350
And we're back here.

3651
03:02:31,370 --> 03:02:34,650
I remember my strats to... oh my gosh.

3652
03:02:45,670 --> 03:02:46,290
Good, good, good.

3653
03:02:46,430 --> 03:02:48,190
Okay, now we be careful here.

3654
03:02:49,430 --> 03:02:49,890
Okay.

3655
03:02:51,150 --> 03:02:53,730
We made it past the most difficult part for me.

3656
03:03:02,940 --> 03:03:03,600
Uh-oh.

3657
03:03:03,620 --> 03:03:04,780
I don't have a lot of time left though.

3658
03:03:05,600 --> 03:03:06,760
We made it!

3659
03:03:08,480 --> 03:03:08,940
Okay.

3660
03:03:12,760 --> 03:03:13,220
Okay.

3661
03:03:13,220 --> 03:03:13,680
Alright.

3662
03:03:20,920 --> 03:03:22,200
And it was about here.

3663
03:03:23,820 --> 03:03:24,280
Yes.

3664
03:03:40,560 --> 03:03:44,520
I'm really having to like take such deep breaths with this level.

3665
03:03:45,040 --> 03:03:45,720
Okay.

3666
03:03:47,240 --> 03:03:47,920
Pixel.

3667
03:03:47,920 --> 03:03:49,480
Perfect precision.

3668
03:03:49,900 --> 03:03:54,420
It's not... you can't just jump off at Landis Man!

3669
03:03:54,680 --> 03:03:55,120
Please!

3670
03:03:55,320 --> 03:03:56,720
You can't just jump off!

3671
03:03:58,860 --> 03:03:59,540
Okay.

3672
03:04:01,100 --> 03:04:03,220
You can't just jump off, would you please?

3673
03:04:09,880 --> 03:04:10,280
No!

3674
03:04:15,650 --> 03:04:17,150
Why, John Atlantis?

3675
03:04:20,610 --> 03:04:26,130
I wish there was a... I was gonna say I wish there was a way that I could just practice the stage over and over again.

3676
03:04:26,570 --> 03:04:31,890
And I mean, technically, if I were to save state it, I could, but I'm not going to do that.

3677
03:04:31,970 --> 03:04:33,550
I'm going to do it proper.

3678
03:04:34,230 --> 03:04:34,930
Oh, my God.

3679
03:04:35,030 --> 03:04:37,090
Why did I not just jump to the next one?

3680
03:04:37,130 --> 03:04:38,690
I knew the next one would make it.

3681
03:04:42,550 --> 03:04:42,850
Okay.

3682
03:04:50,690 --> 03:04:53,430
And then if I don't get the star, I have to go back.

3683
03:04:53,630 --> 03:04:54,990
Which is even worse.

3684
03:04:56,190 --> 03:04:57,390
I have to go back.

3685
03:04:58,550 --> 03:05:01,570
I have to go all the way back and try and get it again.

3686
03:05:02,390 --> 03:05:02,790
Okay.

3687
03:05:02,950 --> 03:05:03,350
Oh.

3688
03:05:03,550 --> 03:05:04,170
Oh, nice.

3689
03:05:04,410 --> 03:05:05,350
I made it somehow.

3690
03:05:05,610 --> 03:05:05,790
No!

3691
03:05:07,950 --> 03:05:08,350
Hmm.

3692
03:05:11,730 --> 03:05:12,430
Hmm.

3693
03:05:19,830 --> 03:05:21,270
The worst part is...

3694
03:05:21,270 --> 03:05:26,290
If I don't, if I, if I don't make it past it, or if I make it past this...

3695
03:05:26,950 --> 03:05:28,030
And then...

3696
03:05:30,450 --> 03:05:32,950
And then, there's an even harder level.

3697
03:05:33,330 --> 03:05:34,630
What do I do?

3698
03:05:35,810 --> 03:05:37,410
What do I do?

3699
03:05:37,410 --> 03:05:37,610
What do I do?

3700
03:05:42,490 --> 03:05:46,670
Because it'll make the last level easy because I'll have this invincibility.

3701
03:05:47,290 --> 03:05:50,230
But if there's something even worse than this...

3702
03:05:55,980 --> 03:05:58,640
It's these tiny guys, you know, in the middle.

3703
03:05:59,660 --> 03:06:00,240
Okay.

3704
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:06,060
Just jump!

3705
03:06:06,960 --> 03:06:07,940
Oh, my

3706
03:06:16,700 --> 03:06:20,900
God.

3707
03:06:21,180 --> 03:06:22,080
Oh, my God.

3708
03:06:26,490 --> 03:06:28,010
Oh, my God.

3709
03:06:28,170 --> 03:06:28,610
That

3710
03:06:39,290 --> 03:06:41,250
was a close one.

3711
03:06:43,430 --> 03:06:43,810
Boop.

3712
03:06:50,270 --> 03:06:51,030
Okay.

3713
03:06:56,150 --> 03:06:58,210
Oh, my ear itches.

3714
03:06:58,390 --> 03:06:58,830
Okay.

3715
03:07:05,110 --> 03:07:08,990
One thing I think is the most forgiving about this game...

3716
03:07:08,990 --> 03:07:09,150
One thing I think is the most forgiving about this game...

3717
03:07:09,150 --> 03:07:11,870
Is, like, with specifically these guys...

3718
03:07:11,870 --> 03:07:14,310
You can shoot the bomb anywhere on the screen.

3719
03:07:15,110 --> 03:07:16,750
And they'll, like, duck, you know?

3720
03:07:16,930 --> 03:07:18,070
So, if I, like...

3721
03:07:19,430 --> 03:07:20,430
Have to do it...

3722
03:07:20,910 --> 03:07:25,050
Like, in front of them or beside them so that it doesn't hit me too...

3723
03:07:25,050 --> 03:07:26,990
It all works out.

3724
03:07:27,690 --> 03:07:28,370
There we go.

3725
03:07:28,490 --> 03:07:28,690
Okay.

3726
03:07:28,890 --> 03:07:29,610
Third zone!

3727
03:07:32,010 --> 03:07:32,590
Oh, God.

3728
03:07:32,610 --> 03:07:34,070
You have to street start from zone one.

3729
03:07:34,270 --> 03:07:35,150
Oh, yeah.

3730
03:07:35,990 --> 03:07:36,870
Oh, yeah.

3731
03:07:37,850 --> 03:07:38,730
Oh, yeah.

3732
03:07:38,730 --> 03:07:40,150
What do you think this was?

3733
03:07:42,530 --> 03:07:43,010
Okay.

3734
03:07:45,710 --> 03:07:46,190
Fish!

3735
03:07:51,260 --> 03:07:51,840
This one.

3736
03:07:52,500 --> 03:07:53,220
Sixth zone!

3737
03:07:59,660 --> 03:08:00,920
I missed the exit.

3738
03:08:01,080 --> 03:08:01,820
I missed the exit.

3739
03:08:02,480 --> 03:08:03,520
Please, game!

3740
03:08:08,410 --> 03:08:09,370
Eighth zone!

3741
03:08:19,400 --> 03:08:20,160
Eighth zone.

3742
03:08:21,540 --> 03:08:23,960
I said that about eighth zone, but maybe...

3743
03:08:25,180 --> 03:08:28,600
Maybe tenth zone will make me really good at this game, too.

3744
03:08:29,120 --> 03:08:33,200
I guess we'll have to see if I can ever clear it.

3745
03:08:33,400 --> 03:08:34,600
My God.

3746
03:08:35,740 --> 03:08:40,020
It seems like the most impossible feat ever.

3747
03:08:45,670 --> 03:08:46,550
Oh, okay.

3748
03:08:46,610 --> 03:08:46,890
We're here.

3749
03:08:53,730 --> 03:08:54,290
Okay.

3750
03:08:54,290 --> 03:08:54,390
Okay.

3751
03:08:55,450 --> 03:08:56,230
Nice.

3752
03:08:56,850 --> 03:08:57,830
All right.

3753
03:09:04,160 --> 03:09:07,880
You can't jump down from the third floor!

3754
03:09:21,320 --> 03:09:23,240
Whoa, that was close.

3755
03:09:52,460 --> 03:09:54,060
This one works fine.

3756
03:09:54,540 --> 03:09:55,320
Okay.

3757
03:09:56,060 --> 03:09:56,840
Okay.

3758
03:09:56,980 --> 03:09:57,840
All right.

3759
03:10:02,800 --> 03:10:03,280
I got it.

3760
03:10:03,500 --> 03:10:04,460
There we go.

3761
03:10:04,540 --> 03:10:05,940
You have to go from the tippy top.

3762
03:10:10,280 --> 03:10:12,220
Just in case I fell through there.

3763
03:10:17,650 --> 03:10:18,330
Oh, my God.

3764
03:10:19,210 --> 03:10:20,830
I knew that was gonna happen.

3765
03:10:21,130 --> 03:10:21,610
I

3766
03:10:26,240 --> 03:10:27,520
knew that was gonna happen.

3767
03:10:27,920 --> 03:10:29,280
As soon as it happened.

3768
03:10:29,920 --> 03:10:32,520
As soon as I touched the wall, I was like, I'm gonna...

3769
03:10:32,520 --> 03:10:35,220
This damn bomb's gonna explode in my face.

3770
03:10:58,740 --> 03:10:59,220
Music.

3771
03:11:01,280 --> 03:11:01,760
Oh, God.

3772
03:11:01,760 --> 03:11:02,040
What the?

3773
03:11:03,760 --> 03:11:05,420
Where did you come from?

3774
03:11:06,420 --> 03:11:10,140
There's never been a... a crab here!

3775
03:11:14,610 --> 03:11:15,290
Nice.

3776
03:11:15,290 --> 03:11:15,970
Okay.

3777
03:11:16,250 --> 03:11:16,930
Please.

3778
03:11:19,790 --> 03:11:20,830
That was close.

3779
03:11:21,970 --> 03:11:25,330
But close still means we made it.

3780
03:11:25,930 --> 03:11:26,850
For now.

3781
03:11:28,070 --> 03:11:28,750
Okay.

3782
03:11:30,890 --> 03:11:31,570
Yes.

3783
03:11:32,430 --> 03:11:33,330
Tenth zone!

3784
03:11:35,650 --> 03:11:36,870
RNG is a cruel mistress.

3785
03:11:40,780 --> 03:11:41,140
Wait.

3786
03:11:46,500 --> 03:11:46,860
Oh!

3787
03:11:46,960 --> 03:11:47,320
Wait.

3788
03:11:47,540 --> 03:11:48,600
I got the shoes, right?

3789
03:11:53,710 --> 03:11:54,850
I got the shoes, right?

3790
03:11:54,990 --> 03:11:56,950
Or am I... Oh, okay.

3791
03:11:57,050 --> 03:11:57,190
Yeah.

3792
03:11:58,030 --> 03:11:58,750
I don't know why.

3793
03:11:59,630 --> 03:12:00,790
Everything's starting to blend together.

3794
03:12:02,310 --> 03:12:03,530
Everything's starting to blend together.

3795
03:12:06,510 --> 03:12:08,570
Oh my god, no!

3796
03:12:19,960 --> 03:12:20,440
Wait.

3797
03:12:21,080 --> 03:12:21,980
Am I an idiot?

3798
03:12:23,320 --> 03:12:23,800
Yes.

3799
03:12:23,800 --> 03:12:24,800
Yes, you are, mate.

3800
03:12:25,220 --> 03:12:26,020
You're stupid!

3801
03:12:27,220 --> 03:12:32,300
Oh my god.

3802
03:12:37,800 --> 03:12:38,280
Okay.

3803
03:12:41,680 --> 03:12:42,760
You know what?

3804
03:12:42,800 --> 03:12:43,280
Grab that.

3805
03:12:43,400 --> 03:12:46,280
Maybe we'll get an extra life... from it.

3806
03:12:47,360 --> 03:12:48,040
Oh my god.

3807
03:12:48,040 --> 03:12:48,040
Oh my god.

3808
03:12:48,220 --> 03:12:49,180
That was so close.

3809
03:12:55,200 --> 03:12:55,840
I

3810
03:13:00,950 --> 03:13:04,230
think this is where I typically... start.

3811
03:13:08,170 --> 03:13:08,970
No, no.

3812
03:13:16,210 --> 03:13:17,650
We did it!

3813
03:13:19,410 --> 03:13:20,750
And now I'm invincible!

3814
03:13:24,520 --> 03:13:25,360
I think.

3815
03:13:27,720 --> 03:13:28,160
Yeah!

3816
03:13:28,280 --> 03:13:28,700
I'm invincible!

3817
03:13:29,320 --> 03:13:30,300
Unless he's a friend.

3818
03:13:30,780 --> 03:13:31,620
Oh my gosh.

3819
03:13:31,880 --> 03:13:33,360
Imagine if, like, a mimic ate me.

3820
03:13:33,900 --> 03:13:36,620
You can jump at me all you want, bozo.

3821
03:13:36,940 --> 03:13:38,000
I can take it.

3822
03:13:38,120 --> 03:13:39,160
I can take a hint!

3823
03:13:40,080 --> 03:13:41,620
But I can't take a hint!

3824
03:13:45,060 --> 03:13:46,180
Oh my god.

3825
03:13:50,090 --> 03:13:50,630
Oh wait.

3826
03:13:50,770 --> 03:13:54,290
I almost tied to my bob, I think.

3827
03:13:56,930 --> 03:13:57,350
Okay.

3828
03:13:58,430 --> 03:13:59,110
See ya!

3829
03:13:59,910 --> 03:14:01,010
See ya, suckers!

3830
03:14:01,090 --> 03:14:03,530
My game is lagging for some reason.

3831
03:14:03,770 --> 03:14:03,950
Okay.

3832
03:14:04,150 --> 03:14:05,170
Oh, is this a maze?

3833
03:14:05,410 --> 03:14:05,650
Uh oh.

3834
03:14:05,970 --> 03:14:07,310
Okay, I'm just gonna keep going left.

3835
03:14:10,570 --> 03:14:10,990
Ignore.

3836
03:14:10,990 --> 03:14:11,650
Ignore chest.

3837
03:14:11,870 --> 03:14:12,030
Okay.

3838
03:14:12,110 --> 03:14:13,330
Oh gosh, it's a maze.

3839
03:14:13,550 --> 03:14:15,230
Oh, with time not on our side.

3840
03:14:18,850 --> 03:14:19,270
Slug.

3841
03:14:20,970 --> 03:14:22,330
Just keep going left.

3842
03:14:22,330 --> 03:14:23,390
Oh, darn it.

3843
03:14:23,470 --> 03:14:23,730
Again.

3844
03:14:23,990 --> 03:14:25,190
Just keep going left.

3845
03:14:25,310 --> 03:14:26,150
Just keep going left.

3846
03:14:27,610 --> 03:14:28,150
Keep.

3847
03:14:29,770 --> 03:14:30,370
Okay.

3848
03:14:35,820 --> 03:14:36,420
Okay.

3849
03:14:38,080 --> 03:14:38,680
Treasure.

3850
03:14:43,380 --> 03:14:44,080
16th zone!

3851
03:14:47,900 --> 03:14:48,780
What are these?

3852
03:14:49,100 --> 03:14:49,460
Oh.

3853
03:14:53,940 --> 03:14:54,540
Okay.

3854
03:14:57,900 --> 03:14:58,460
Oh.

3855
03:14:59,360 --> 03:15:00,280
Oh my gosh.

3856
03:15:00,320 --> 03:15:01,520
Being invincible is awesome!

3857
03:15:04,640 --> 03:15:05,920
Okay, I can't.

3858
03:15:09,180 --> 03:15:09,900
Ignore it.

3859
03:15:09,980 --> 03:15:10,520
Ignore it.

3860
03:15:10,560 --> 03:15:11,140
Ignore it.

3861
03:15:11,160 --> 03:15:11,800
Ignore it.

3862
03:15:14,020 --> 03:15:17,020
I wonder if this place has a hidden...

3863
03:15:19,080 --> 03:15:20,180
door or not.

3864
03:15:20,460 --> 03:15:27,140
That's my biggest worry is losing a life because I'm just walking and walking and I'm walking in circles like what?

3865
03:15:27,140 --> 03:15:28,560
What appears to be happening now?

3866
03:15:28,720 --> 03:15:29,280
Oh, never mind.

3867
03:15:29,700 --> 03:15:30,260
Five!

3868
03:15:30,520 --> 03:15:30,740
Oh!

3869
03:15:34,780 --> 03:15:36,240
She can tank the poop!

3870
03:15:36,960 --> 03:15:38,940
Hell yeah, I can tank the poop.

3871
03:15:42,400 --> 03:15:43,640
I can tank it!

3872
03:15:47,670 --> 03:15:48,230
Oh.

3873
03:15:48,230 --> 03:15:48,790
Okay.

3874
03:15:56,100 --> 03:15:58,700
I'm all... I'm... I'm covered in shit.

3875
03:15:59,120 --> 03:16:00,540
I'm... I'm...

3876
03:16:01,360 --> 03:16:02,960
I'm... That's why...

3877
03:16:02,960 --> 03:16:05,920
That's why they're leaving me alone because I'm so smelly right now.

3878
03:16:17,460 --> 03:16:17,980
Okay.

3879
03:16:19,700 --> 03:16:21,880
This game has gotten infinitely easier.

3880
03:16:24,300 --> 03:16:25,600
But where is the door?

3881
03:16:26,460 --> 03:16:26,660
Oh!

3882
03:16:27,880 --> 03:16:29,460
Speak and you shall receive.

3883
03:16:29,620 --> 03:16:30,720
Twenty-first zone!

3884
03:16:33,960 --> 03:16:34,480
Oh?

3885
03:16:35,340 --> 03:16:35,860
Wait.

3886
03:16:40,030 --> 03:16:41,270
Is this it?

3887
03:16:41,390 --> 03:16:42,690
Is this the one I'm supposed to go through?

3888
03:16:43,230 --> 03:16:44,310
Twenty-third zone?

3889
03:16:48,880 --> 03:16:51,080
I don't remember how many there were...

3890
03:16:51,760 --> 03:16:52,160
between.

3891
03:16:52,680 --> 03:16:53,580
I feel like I've...

3892
03:16:54,100 --> 03:16:55,480
I feel like I messed up.

3893
03:16:57,980 --> 03:16:59,680
I feel like I messed up.

3894
03:16:59,820 --> 03:17:00,100
Uh-oh.

3895
03:17:00,320 --> 03:17:01,540
Wait, what do I... what do I...

3896
03:17:01,540 --> 03:17:02,720
Oh, do I have to make that?

3897
03:17:04,640 --> 03:17:05,040
Okay.

3898
03:17:05,700 --> 03:17:06,100
Nice.

3899
03:17:10,300 --> 03:17:11,320
Just keep going.

3900
03:17:12,020 --> 03:17:12,580
I guess.

3901
03:17:14,220 --> 03:17:14,620
Yippee!

3902
03:17:16,220 --> 03:17:18,180
But I think if I die, I'll lose the star.

3903
03:17:18,180 --> 03:17:19,000
Okay.

3904
03:17:19,760 --> 03:17:20,920
Twenty-seventh zone?

3905
03:17:22,820 --> 03:17:23,300
Okay.

3906
03:17:26,500 --> 03:17:27,820
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3907
03:17:27,900 --> 03:17:28,420
What is this?

3908
03:17:29,200 --> 03:17:30,420
What is this evil?

3909
03:17:31,240 --> 03:17:32,080
What are you?

3910
03:17:32,880 --> 03:17:33,780
Oh, my God!

3911
03:17:39,400 --> 03:17:43,000
Should I be checking the strategy guide?

3912
03:17:43,220 --> 03:17:43,980
I have no idea.

3913
03:17:46,020 --> 03:17:48,040
I mean, I'm still invincible, so...

3914
03:17:48,040 --> 03:17:48,160
Okay.

3915
03:17:49,520 --> 03:17:50,840
I'll just keep going for now.

3916
03:17:51,560 --> 03:17:52,280
Oh, my gosh.

3917
03:17:52,360 --> 03:17:52,560
Please!

3918
03:17:55,660 --> 03:17:56,140
Okay.

3919
03:17:59,950 --> 03:18:00,430
Oh,

3920
03:18:04,780 --> 03:18:05,080
gosh.

3921
03:18:05,780 --> 03:18:06,260
Nice.

3922
03:18:09,140 --> 03:18:09,980
Wiki How?

3923
03:18:12,300 --> 03:18:13,460
I'm gonna pause real quick.

3924
03:18:13,580 --> 03:18:14,020
I'm actually...

3925
03:18:14,020 --> 03:18:14,180
What?

3926
03:18:14,200 --> 03:18:15,160
What am I on?

3927
03:18:15,500 --> 03:18:15,980
Twenty...

3928
03:18:17,460 --> 03:18:17,940
Twenty...

3929
03:18:17,940 --> 03:18:19,000
Uh-oh.

3930
03:18:19,860 --> 03:18:20,980
I'm on the red path.

3931
03:18:21,740 --> 03:18:23,080
I was supposed to go to fourth.

3932
03:18:23,080 --> 03:18:23,280
Four!

3933
03:18:37,230 --> 03:18:39,270
I was supposed to go to four...

3934
03:18:40,010 --> 03:18:41,330
Now where am I?

3935
03:18:41,370 --> 03:18:42,150
I'm on the 23rd.

3936
03:18:42,370 --> 03:18:43,770
I'm on the blue path.

3937
03:18:44,350 --> 03:18:45,730
Oh my god, no.

3938
03:18:46,170 --> 03:18:47,130
What happened?

3939
03:18:47,550 --> 03:18:50,090
Where did the blue path... where did the four door go?

3940
03:18:50,510 --> 03:18:51,830
No, no, no...

3941
03:18:51,830 --> 03:18:56,130
No, no, no, no!

3942
03:18:56,290 --> 03:18:57,670
God, I'm gonna have to do ten...

3943
03:19:07,150 --> 03:19:07,650
Wait a second.

3944
03:19:08,030 --> 03:19:09,270
There's two choices here.

3945
03:19:09,910 --> 03:19:12,550
Which door... which door can I take?

3946
03:19:28,370 --> 03:19:29,110
29th zone.

3947
03:19:29,750 --> 03:19:30,510
Oh, sorry!

3948
03:19:30,930 --> 03:19:31,630
Sorry, sorry!

3949
03:19:33,430 --> 03:19:34,630
I'm so sorry, you guys.

3950
03:19:34,770 --> 03:19:35,250
I'm so sorry.

3951
03:19:36,430 --> 03:19:37,550
There was two doors.

3952
03:19:39,470 --> 03:19:40,370
I'm so sorry.

3953
03:19:40,570 --> 03:19:42,650
Wait, actually now I wanna see where I am again.

3954
03:19:44,770 --> 03:19:46,610
Which door would that have gone to?

3955
03:19:52,560 --> 03:19:53,580
Wait, what am I at?

3956
03:19:53,760 --> 03:19:54,860
I have no idea anymore.

3957
03:19:55,500 --> 03:19:56,200
You know what?

3958
03:19:56,560 --> 03:19:57,000
Whatever.

3959
03:19:57,320 --> 03:19:59,100
We're just... this is... this is it.

3960
03:19:59,320 --> 03:20:00,180
This is it.

3961
03:20:01,280 --> 03:20:02,480
Can I... is this land?

3962
03:20:03,460 --> 03:20:04,140
Oh, okay.

3963
03:20:04,220 --> 03:20:04,760
It is land.

3964
03:20:05,660 --> 03:20:07,700
Look at these little skulls.

3965
03:20:07,780 --> 03:20:11,320
Oh, are you kidding me right now?

3966
03:20:12,020 --> 03:20:13,800
Are you kidding me right now?

3967
03:20:15,580 --> 03:20:16,600
I have to make that?

3968
03:20:16,780 --> 03:20:17,540
Okay, I made it.

3969
03:20:18,820 --> 03:20:19,260
Gosh.

3970
03:20:24,620 --> 03:20:25,380
I'm so good.

3971
03:20:27,280 --> 03:20:28,120
What the...

3972
03:20:30,040 --> 03:20:31,240
I'm taking the last door.

3973
03:20:32,800 --> 03:20:33,600
31st zone!

3974
03:20:37,780 --> 03:20:39,260
Oh, I got a lot of points.

3975
03:20:43,160 --> 03:20:46,360
Actually, I wonder if it does make me... it does want me to go back.

3976
03:20:46,920 --> 03:20:47,320
Probably.

3977
03:20:48,920 --> 03:20:49,320
Because...

3978
03:20:51,540 --> 03:20:53,680
It probably wants me to go back.

3979
03:20:54,540 --> 03:20:56,160
Because there were several doors.

3980
03:20:56,380 --> 03:20:57,020
So, you know what?

3981
03:20:57,040 --> 03:20:57,620
Let's just go back.

3982
03:20:59,680 --> 03:21:00,680
31st zone.

3983
03:21:01,720 --> 03:21:03,720
I probably have so many lives now.

3984
03:21:04,140 --> 03:21:06,820
But if I think I fall, I completely lose.

3985
03:21:07,880 --> 03:21:08,680
Oh my god.

3986
03:21:08,700 --> 03:21:11,260
I completely lose my invincibility.

3987
03:21:11,620 --> 03:21:12,440
Why are you...

3988
03:21:13,620 --> 03:21:15,400
Oh, it's getting stuck on these guys.

3989
03:21:15,800 --> 03:21:16,260
Stop.

3990
03:21:16,320 --> 03:21:17,440
I'm trying to open the second door.

3991
03:21:20,220 --> 03:21:21,240
42nd zone!

3992
03:21:21,380 --> 03:21:21,840
42nd zone!

3993
03:21:26,140 --> 03:21:26,700
42nd

3994
03:22:08,390 --> 03:22:08,950
zone!

3995
03:22:08,950 --> 03:22:09,290
42nd zone!

3996
03:22:15,150 --> 03:22:16,750
I get trolled, I guess.

3997
03:22:24,830 --> 03:22:26,750
I don't even know if I can be mad.

3998
03:22:27,790 --> 03:22:29,690
I don't even know if I can be mad.

3999
03:22:31,450 --> 03:22:32,090
Oh, oops.

4000
03:22:32,370 --> 03:22:33,390
I changed it.

4001
03:22:33,630 --> 03:22:36,370
I don't even know if I can be angry.

4002
03:22:44,060 --> 03:22:45,300
Are you mad, Mint?

4003
03:22:45,420 --> 03:22:46,280
I don't think so.

4004
03:22:46,740 --> 03:22:50,920
I think I'm really sad that I have to go through zone 10 again.

4005
03:22:52,540 --> 03:22:58,020
I think I'm just more sad that I have to go... How do I find...

4006
03:22:59,900 --> 03:23:01,940
Okay, we're gonna have to find door 4.

4007
03:23:05,160 --> 03:23:12,980
If I get past Zone... If I can get past Zone 10, I have to find the...

4008
03:23:12,980 --> 03:23:13,580
Oh my god.

4009
03:23:13,720 --> 03:23:14,280
Damn it.

4010
03:23:15,500 --> 03:23:18,340
Was this game made by Millenium Game Development?

4011
03:23:23,240 --> 03:23:25,260
The rage refuses to manifest.

4012
03:23:26,020 --> 03:23:26,500
Yeah.

4013
03:23:30,640 --> 03:23:32,580
Actually, I think I kinda wanna start over.

4014
03:23:34,400 --> 03:23:36,620
I think I wanna start over with all seven lives.

4015
03:23:37,880 --> 03:23:40,160
I wanna start over with all seven lives!

4016
03:23:40,420 --> 03:23:41,940
I wanna start over with all seven lives.

4017
03:23:44,980 --> 03:23:45,460
Punishment.

4018
03:23:46,300 --> 03:23:47,640
What's the goal in this game?

4019
03:23:47,840 --> 03:23:51,040
To discover the mystery of Atlantis.

4020
03:23:52,560 --> 03:23:53,680
Atlantis nonazo.

4021
03:24:00,560 --> 03:24:03,160
I cannot believe that...

4022
03:24:03,160 --> 03:24:04,940
There was three doors!

4023
03:24:05,520 --> 03:24:10,540
And one of them was just a black hole that stole all of my lives!

4024
03:24:10,780 --> 03:24:11,300
I can...

4025
03:24:11,300 --> 03:24:13,120
I mean, I can believe it.

4026
03:24:13,620 --> 03:24:16,140
I'm gonna skip over that so that I don't...

4027
03:24:17,400 --> 03:24:17,960
Accidentally...

4028
03:24:18,480 --> 03:24:19,540
Get an extra life.

4029
03:24:22,720 --> 03:24:23,200
Okay.

4030
03:24:23,760 --> 03:24:24,240
Alright.

4031
03:24:27,880 --> 03:24:30,460
Atlantis truly is a mysterious place.

4032
03:24:30,560 --> 03:24:33,160
Why did they build a door that leads to your death?

4033
03:24:39,210 --> 03:24:40,470
Oh my god, I'm playing.

4034
03:24:40,610 --> 03:24:40,990
Oh my god.

4035
03:24:41,090 --> 03:24:41,430
Okay.

4036
03:24:42,010 --> 03:24:42,490
Actually...

4037
03:24:46,030 --> 03:24:46,870
That was close.

4038
03:24:47,010 --> 03:24:47,370
Okay.

4039
03:24:47,830 --> 03:24:53,910
I wanted to grab that so we get a little extra bonus score for when we wanna get an extra life.

4040
03:24:56,710 --> 03:25:00,610
I don't remember how much you need for an extra life, but...

4041
03:25:02,710 --> 03:25:04,690
Every little bit helps, I think?

4042
03:25:06,490 --> 03:25:07,430
Oh my god.

4043
03:25:08,150 --> 03:25:08,550
Wait!

4044
03:25:08,690 --> 03:25:09,130
No, no, no.

4045
03:25:09,190 --> 03:25:09,770
I am going through here.

4046
03:25:09,870 --> 03:25:10,190
I forgot.

4047
03:25:11,770 --> 03:25:13,530
All the doors lead to your death, boss.

4048
03:25:14,090 --> 03:25:16,970
Where would it have gone if we hadn't gone through...

4049
03:25:17,990 --> 03:25:18,690
That one.

4050
03:25:20,370 --> 03:25:22,090
And I even opened the first one.

4051
03:25:22,210 --> 03:25:22,970
I'm such an idiot.

4052
03:25:22,970 --> 03:25:23,390
God.

4053
03:25:25,330 --> 03:25:26,590
I'm such an idiot.

4054
03:25:26,750 --> 03:25:29,770
And I got like a million points from the last door.

4055
03:25:35,580 --> 03:25:38,960
And of course I was so excited about getting through...

4056
03:25:38,960 --> 03:25:41,380
I mean, of course, who would have...

4057
03:25:41,380 --> 03:25:46,620
You know, I don't think anybody would have thought that that door lead to level 4.

4058
03:25:47,120 --> 03:25:47,680
Probably.

4059
03:25:49,360 --> 03:25:51,200
If they passed zone 10.

4060
03:25:51,500 --> 03:25:52,320
I imagine.

4061
03:25:53,240 --> 03:25:54,340
Third zone.

4062
03:25:57,380 --> 03:25:57,940
Okay.

4063
03:25:59,360 --> 03:25:59,920
Fish.

4064
03:26:05,910 --> 03:26:06,470
Fish.

4065
03:26:09,550 --> 03:26:10,110
Fish.

4066
03:26:14,710 --> 03:26:15,270
Wait.

4067
03:26:15,410 --> 03:26:16,030
It's this one.

4068
03:26:16,110 --> 03:26:16,370
Sorry.

4069
03:26:16,470 --> 03:26:18,210
I got a little confused.

4070
03:26:19,390 --> 03:26:19,950
Okay.

4071
03:26:19,990 --> 03:26:20,350
Okay.

4072
03:26:20,450 --> 03:26:20,670
Okay.

4073
03:26:25,060 --> 03:26:25,620
Please.

4074
03:26:26,760 --> 03:26:27,540
Eighth zone.

4075
03:26:28,040 --> 03:26:28,720
All right.

4076
03:26:28,740 --> 03:26:29,360
Here's where we start.

4077
03:26:29,360 --> 03:26:29,560
I think I'm gonna struggle.

4078
03:26:30,460 --> 03:26:31,440
That's okay though.

4079
03:26:34,440 --> 03:26:35,480
I am stronger.

4080
03:26:36,300 --> 03:26:38,980
I am not the same Mint I was.

4081
03:26:39,920 --> 03:26:40,500
Twenty.

4082
03:26:40,740 --> 03:26:41,140
Nay.

4083
03:26:41,580 --> 03:26:42,160
Thirty.

4084
03:26:42,480 --> 03:26:43,040
Nay.

4085
03:26:43,340 --> 03:26:44,540
An hour ago.

4086
03:26:45,060 --> 03:26:46,200
I have learned.

4087
03:26:47,160 --> 03:26:48,280
I have grown.

4088
03:26:49,440 --> 03:26:51,060
I have nozzled.

4089
03:26:53,740 --> 03:26:54,480
Oh my...

4090
03:26:54,480 --> 03:26:55,280
Okay.

4091
03:26:55,380 --> 03:26:56,820
First of all, that didn't affect him.

4092
03:26:56,900 --> 03:26:59,220
Second of all, I am very happy that I didn't die.

4093
03:26:59,220 --> 03:27:01,440
But why did that not affect him?

4094
03:27:01,840 --> 03:27:04,660
Why did he not go into his little shell?

4095
03:27:05,080 --> 03:27:05,320
Oh.

4096
03:27:05,360 --> 03:27:05,620
Wait.

4097
03:27:05,820 --> 03:27:07,200
Actually, I want him to go.

4098
03:27:07,940 --> 03:27:08,520
There we go.

4099
03:27:08,640 --> 03:27:08,840
Okay.

4100
03:27:09,800 --> 03:27:10,200
Why?

4101
03:27:12,220 --> 03:27:13,340
He fears nothing.

4102
03:27:14,920 --> 03:27:15,320
Okay.

4103
03:27:15,400 --> 03:27:16,780
Here's this part.

4104
03:27:17,380 --> 03:27:18,600
We need you to go away.

4105
03:27:18,740 --> 03:27:19,620
Thank you.

4106
03:27:24,080 --> 03:27:25,380
And we need you to go away.

4107
03:27:25,400 --> 03:27:25,960
Thank you.

4108
03:27:28,740 --> 03:27:30,160
And we need you to go away.

4109
03:27:30,240 --> 03:27:30,460
Thank you.

4110
03:27:30,460 --> 03:27:30,860
Thank you.

4111
03:27:30,860 --> 03:27:32,040
Thank you.

4112
03:27:39,640 --> 03:27:40,160
Thankus...

4113
03:27:40,160 --> 03:27:41,480
I really thought I had it.

4114
03:27:41,560 --> 03:27:43,320
I really thought I had it.

4115
03:27:43,320 --> 03:27:43,880
Clutch bomb.

4116
03:27:44,120 --> 03:27:45,600
But I really thought I had it.

4117
03:27:45,740 --> 03:27:46,900
I thought so.

4118
03:27:47,060 --> 03:27:48,140
I thought I had it.

4119
03:27:54,900 --> 03:27:55,420
Thanx.

4120
03:28:04,610 --> 03:28:11,630
I do want to thank this game that testing my patience, giving me a new appreciation on AfterLive.

4121
03:28:13,170 --> 03:28:13,850
Thank you.

4122
03:28:16,730 --> 03:28:23,810
To whoever created this game... I hope you know that you have... there's a very special place in hell for you.

4123
03:28:30,490 --> 03:28:34,910
Oh my gosh, I'm so... I'm so scared of this part!

4124
03:28:35,470 --> 03:28:37,010
Oh my gosh, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4125
03:28:37,850 --> 03:28:39,270
Okay, there we go, okay.

4126
03:28:39,790 --> 03:28:42,050
There we go, there we go, there we go, there we go.

4127
03:28:45,210 --> 03:28:45,850
Okay, alright.

4128
03:28:46,890 --> 03:28:48,230
Oh my gosh, am I gonna make it?

4129
03:28:48,590 --> 03:28:49,430
Do I have enough time?

4130
03:28:49,590 --> 03:28:50,930
Oh my god, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

4131
03:28:55,440 --> 03:28:56,400
Okay, oh my god.

4132
03:28:59,740 --> 03:29:03,160
Okay, we have six lives!

4133
03:29:04,760 --> 03:29:05,340
Not bad!

4134
03:29:18,420 --> 03:29:18,740
Okay...

4135
03:29:23,910 --> 03:29:25,450
In fact, I am gonna grab that.

4136
03:29:26,450 --> 03:29:28,910
Maybe get an extra life, I don't know if it does or not.

4137
03:29:30,770 --> 03:29:31,170
No!

4138
03:30:06,940 --> 03:30:07,540
That's fine.

4139
03:30:08,280 --> 03:30:09,220
That's fine.

4140
03:30:10,020 --> 03:30:10,840
Oh god!

4141
03:30:14,920 --> 03:30:16,300
Jump King no nazo.

4142
03:30:16,800 --> 03:30:18,840
There's a second door to the eighth stage, remember?

4143
03:30:20,800 --> 03:30:21,720
What about it?

4144
03:30:27,600 --> 03:30:28,540
What about it?

4145
03:30:31,240 --> 03:30:32,320
Oh my god!

4146
03:30:37,080 --> 03:30:38,960
You can grab the star and go back.

4147
03:30:42,120 --> 03:30:44,580
Where did the... where did that stage lead to?

4148
03:30:44,660 --> 03:30:45,540
I actually don't remember.

4149
03:30:49,160 --> 03:30:51,120
No, that went to Nagoya, didn't it?

4150
03:30:52,180 --> 03:30:53,980
That went to Nagoya, didn't it?

4151
03:30:54,060 --> 03:30:54,840
Oh my god!

4152
03:31:06,640 --> 03:31:07,360
Ui!

4153
03:31:08,440 --> 03:31:09,160
Ui!

4154
03:31:10,920 --> 03:31:11,640
Ui!

4155
03:31:12,760 --> 03:31:13,480
Ui!

4156
03:31:14,380 --> 03:31:14,800
Ui!

4157
03:31:17,720 --> 03:31:18,440
Ui!

4158
03:31:19,580 --> 03:31:20,300
Ui!

4159
03:31:23,640 --> 03:31:24,360
Ui!

4160
03:31:24,360 --> 03:31:24,680
Huy!

4161
03:31:27,240 --> 03:31:28,360
Huy!

4162
03:31:31,180 --> 03:31:32,300
Huy!

4163
03:31:33,060 --> 03:31:34,180
Huy!

4164
03:31:35,580 --> 03:31:36,700
Huy!

4165
03:31:37,100 --> 03:31:38,220
Huy!

4166
03:31:39,400 --> 03:31:40,520
Huy!

4167
03:31:41,180 --> 03:31:42,300
Huy!

4168
03:31:42,780 --> 03:31:43,900
Huy!

4169
03:31:49,320 --> 03:31:51,080
Where's the secret door?

4170
03:31:51,340 --> 03:31:52,440
Where's the other door?

4171
03:31:52,440 --> 03:31:52,640
Four.

4172
03:31:53,900 --> 03:31:55,760
I can't go anywhere else.

4173
03:31:57,760 --> 03:31:58,840
No, wait.

4174
03:32:00,660 --> 03:32:02,300
No, no, no, no, no.

4175
03:32:08,260 --> 03:32:09,180
Pause the game.

4176
03:32:15,190 --> 03:32:16,870
Does this lead to four?

4177
03:32:21,540 --> 03:32:22,860
Okay, I'm gonna check.

4178
03:32:23,540 --> 03:32:26,620
Well, it is four that we go to, that I need to go to.

4179
03:32:28,040 --> 03:32:29,920
Yes, ten to four.

4180
03:32:30,780 --> 03:32:32,320
Ten to four.

4181
03:32:32,640 --> 03:32:33,740
You're up soon.

4182
03:32:36,920 --> 03:32:37,920
Thanks, Amarvi!

4183
03:32:38,380 --> 03:32:42,280
She's grunting like that because she's actually jumping in her room as she plays.

4184
03:32:47,130 --> 03:32:48,510
This goes to twelve.

4185
03:32:55,970 --> 03:32:57,770
We don't have so much time, you guys.

4186
03:32:57,950 --> 03:32:58,150
Wait.

4187
03:32:58,510 --> 03:32:59,070
Wait.

4188
03:33:01,370 --> 03:33:03,370
You might be wondering, what the hell?

4189
03:33:03,390 --> 03:33:04,630
What the heck are you doing, Minto?

4190
03:33:05,190 --> 03:33:06,430
I'm gonna go back.

4191
03:33:10,260 --> 03:33:11,400
I'm gonna go back.

4192
03:33:17,970 --> 03:33:19,590
Do I have to... I'm scared.

4193
03:33:19,890 --> 03:33:22,070
Do I have to bomb myself in front of the door?

4194
03:33:22,930 --> 03:33:23,650
Or somewhere?

4195
03:33:25,390 --> 03:33:27,290
Do I have to die to a bomb somewhere?

4196
03:33:31,210 --> 03:33:34,130
I don't think it's...

4197
03:33:37,460 --> 03:33:38,540
No, no, no!

4198
03:33:41,880 --> 03:33:43,240
Oh my god!

4199
03:33:45,340 --> 03:33:46,560
Oh my god.

4200
03:33:50,520 --> 03:33:53,660
Okay, I have to go and bomb here.

4201
03:33:56,280 --> 03:33:57,000
Okay.

4202
03:33:57,540 --> 03:33:58,620
Okay, okay, okay.

4203
03:33:59,960 --> 03:34:01,700
Now, with precision.

4204
03:34:05,260 --> 03:34:05,740
Take it.

4205
03:34:07,280 --> 03:34:08,080
With precision.

4206
03:34:08,080 --> 03:34:08,140
With precision.

4207
03:34:13,730 --> 03:34:14,570
Fourth zone!

4208
03:34:18,610 --> 03:34:19,450
Fourth zone!

4209
03:34:19,450 --> 03:34:19,890
Where am I?

4210
03:34:20,170 --> 03:34:21,190
Oh, I'm up here.

4211
03:34:21,370 --> 03:34:21,610
Okay.

4212
03:34:24,750 --> 03:34:25,910
Will the spikes kill me?

4213
03:34:25,970 --> 03:34:26,150
No.

4214
03:34:26,370 --> 03:34:26,630
Okay.

4215
03:34:29,910 --> 03:34:30,330
Jump!

4216
03:34:31,990 --> 03:34:32,830
Alright, now...

4217
03:34:32,830 --> 03:34:33,270
Hold on, sorry.

4218
03:34:33,410 --> 03:34:34,310
I don't mean to pause again.

4219
03:34:34,490 --> 03:34:37,230
I'm looking for... I'm looking for door...

4220
03:34:37,230 --> 03:34:38,710
I'm looking for door... twenty-five!

4221
03:34:39,070 --> 03:34:39,850
Twenty-five!

4222
03:34:40,070 --> 03:34:41,030
I wish these were labeled.

4223
03:34:42,810 --> 03:34:43,930
Twenty-five!

4224
03:34:44,050 --> 03:34:44,910
Twenty-five!

4225
03:34:45,010 --> 03:34:45,730
Twenty-five!

4226
03:34:46,190 --> 03:34:46,370
Twenty-five!

4227
03:34:46,370 --> 03:34:46,370
Twenty-five!

4228
03:34:46,370 --> 03:34:46,370
Twenty-five!

4229
03:34:46,370 --> 03:34:46,390
Hoy!

4230
03:34:49,550 --> 03:34:50,150
Seven?

4231
03:34:54,650 --> 03:34:55,790
Time to go back.

4232
03:34:57,310 --> 03:34:58,250
Leave me alone.

4233
03:35:00,110 --> 03:35:01,290
Leave me alone!

4234
03:35:06,810 --> 03:35:07,410
Seven.

4235
03:35:08,650 --> 03:35:09,650
7.

4236
03:35:10,450 --> 03:35:12,850
Okay, keep on searching.

4237
03:35:17,570 --> 03:35:20,510
Okay, it's gonna be around here somewhere.

4238
03:35:22,970 --> 03:35:23,970
Here!

4239
03:35:24,950 --> 03:35:25,450
Third!

4240
03:35:38,980 --> 03:35:39,980
Floor.

4241
03:35:44,500 --> 03:35:47,360
Is there anything over there?

4242
03:35:49,460 --> 03:35:51,120
If I jump...

4243
03:35:52,060 --> 03:35:53,120
If I jump...

4244
03:36:07,580 --> 03:36:09,540
Check to the right.

4245
03:36:19,660 --> 03:36:20,860
Fourth zone.

4246
03:36:21,220 --> 03:36:21,560
Okay.

4247
03:36:23,060 --> 03:36:23,820
Can I make this?

4248
03:36:24,000 --> 03:36:24,900
Actually, I don't know.

4249
03:36:25,780 --> 03:36:27,740
I don't think I can make this unless I...

4250
03:36:30,180 --> 03:36:31,800
Oh no, I have one more!

4251
03:36:32,180 --> 03:36:32,580
Wait!

4252
03:36:32,720 --> 03:36:33,540
This might be okay.

4253
03:36:35,220 --> 03:36:35,620
Wait.

4254
03:36:35,740 --> 03:36:36,480
No, it's not okay.

4255
03:36:36,660 --> 03:36:37,420
This is not okay.

4256
03:36:37,960 --> 03:36:39,200
I have one life left.

4257
03:36:40,540 --> 03:36:42,020
And no way to get down.

4258
03:36:47,780 --> 03:36:48,360
There we go.

4259
03:36:56,150 --> 03:36:58,010
I lost my invincibility.

4260
03:37:03,400 --> 03:37:05,060
I lost my...

4261
03:37:05,840 --> 03:37:06,740
Jax, thank you.

4262
03:37:06,760 --> 03:37:07,420
Are you winning, Mint?

4263
03:37:08,040 --> 03:37:09,700
Well, I mean...

4264
03:37:12,000 --> 03:37:14,000
We're closer to...

4265
03:37:14,000 --> 03:37:18,540
Okay, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 4...

4266
03:37:20,040 --> 03:37:22,520
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

4267
03:37:22,520 --> 03:37:24,480
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

4268
03:37:24,480 --> 03:37:27,080
On this route, we only have 5 more levels left.

4269
03:37:27,460 --> 03:37:30,360
So I think we're over halfway there.

4270
03:37:30,360 --> 03:37:35,060
And I can get past level 10 now, so...

4271
03:37:36,460 --> 03:37:38,140
I think that's...

4272
03:37:38,140 --> 03:37:41,460
That is a win in my book.

4273
03:37:41,800 --> 03:37:42,780
Quite honestly.

4274
03:37:50,000 --> 03:37:51,020
It's only been...

4275
03:37:51,020 --> 03:37:53,720
It's only been 4 hours.

4276
03:37:53,920 --> 03:37:54,480
We're fine.

4277
03:38:04,380 --> 03:38:05,700
I'm starting to get hungry though.

4278
03:38:06,380 --> 03:38:08,040
But I have some food that...

4279
03:38:08,040 --> 03:38:08,460
I can...

4280
03:38:10,620 --> 03:38:11,180
What?

4281
03:38:11,600 --> 03:38:13,140
I threw the bomb!

4282
03:38:16,980 --> 03:38:17,540
You...

4283
03:38:17,540 --> 03:38:20,180
This is where I should not be losing lives at.

4284
03:38:21,780 --> 03:38:22,940
Okay, I'm gonna start over.

4285
03:38:24,420 --> 03:38:26,140
I'm gonna... I'm gonna start over.

4286
03:38:26,820 --> 03:38:27,940
I'm gonna start over.

4287
03:38:29,980 --> 03:38:31,100
Just kill me.

4288
03:38:32,880 --> 03:38:34,340
Rage meter 0%.

4289
03:38:43,630 --> 03:38:44,470
Are you gonna die?

4290
03:38:44,590 --> 03:38:45,110
I'm gonna die!

4291
03:38:45,110 --> 03:38:45,830
I'm gonna die!

4292
03:38:53,300 --> 03:38:53,820
I'm going to die!

4293
03:38:53,820 --> 03:38:54,900
Is the rage meter broken?

4294
03:38:55,160 --> 03:38:56,140
No, I don't think so.

4295
03:38:56,640 --> 03:38:57,360
Beep, beep, beep.

4296
03:38:58,000 --> 03:38:58,520
No!

4297
03:38:59,640 --> 03:39:03,340
I think I'm at rage...

4298
03:39:05,720 --> 03:39:06,240
5%.

4299
03:39:08,620 --> 03:39:10,480
Just because of that one snail.

4300
03:39:12,060 --> 03:39:13,340
Really grind my gears.

4301
03:39:13,340 --> 03:39:13,400
Cheers.

4302
03:39:20,760 --> 03:39:22,820
You can reset the game from the switch menu.

4303
03:39:22,980 --> 03:39:24,900
I'm trying to pretend I'm not on the switch.

4304
03:39:26,920 --> 03:39:28,340
I'm trying to be like...

4305
03:39:28,340 --> 03:39:31,280
Look at me playing Famicom game.

4306
03:39:33,960 --> 03:39:36,300
So just pretend you don't see the switch menu on the bottom.

4307
03:39:36,620 --> 03:39:37,780
Just pretend.

4308
03:39:44,140 --> 03:39:44,900
Mint game!

4309
03:40:01,120 --> 03:40:02,460
I'm gonna go get some food.

4310
03:40:02,580 --> 03:40:03,520
I'll be right back.

4311
03:40:04,660 --> 03:40:05,640
I'll be right back.

4312
03:40:10,460 --> 03:40:13,200
I'll be like a second because I don't have to heat it up.

4313
03:40:13,240 --> 03:40:16,040
It's just some cheese and crackers and stuff.

4314
03:40:16,160 --> 03:40:16,960
So I'll be right back.

4315
03:41:51,540 --> 03:41:52,140
I'm back.

4316
03:41:52,220 --> 03:41:53,080
I'm back.

4317
03:41:53,680 --> 03:41:54,400
I'm back.

4318
03:41:54,580 --> 03:41:54,860
I'm back.

4319
03:41:54,960 --> 03:41:55,960
We're gonna have a short...

4320
03:41:55,960 --> 03:41:57,660
We're gonna have a short inter...

4321
03:41:58,080 --> 03:41:58,320
mision.

4322
03:41:58,560 --> 03:41:59,480
A short...

4323
03:41:59,980 --> 03:42:00,460
short...

4324
03:42:01,120 --> 03:42:01,600
inter...

4325
03:42:02,160 --> 03:42:02,400
min...

4326
03:42:02,400 --> 03:42:03,080
tion.

4327
03:42:04,400 --> 03:42:05,220
So I can...

4328
03:42:05,220 --> 03:42:06,260
So I can eat.

4329
03:42:06,540 --> 03:42:08,320
So I'm gonna just turn this...

4330
03:42:09,000 --> 03:42:09,480
off.

4331
03:42:09,640 --> 03:42:10,820
So we don't have to listen to it.

4332
03:42:15,360 --> 03:42:16,720
And I got...

4333
03:42:16,720 --> 03:42:17,140
Oh my gosh.

4334
03:42:17,320 --> 03:42:19,460
I got some of my favorite cake last night.

4335
03:42:20,860 --> 03:42:21,340
So...

4336
03:42:22,380 --> 03:42:24,600
I am gonna eat some of that for...

4337
03:42:24,600 --> 03:42:25,100
for...

4338
03:42:25,100 --> 03:42:25,740
for energy.

4339
03:42:26,520 --> 03:42:28,340
And I have some chicken salad.

4340
03:42:28,840 --> 03:42:30,140
And some crackers.

4341
03:42:30,460 --> 03:42:30,960
I mean...

4342
03:42:30,960 --> 03:42:31,420
Not crackers.

4343
03:42:31,620 --> 03:42:32,960
I thought they were crackers.

4344
03:42:33,160 --> 03:42:33,400
It's...

4345
03:42:34,280 --> 03:42:35,080
It's a...

4346
03:42:35,080 --> 03:42:35,980
It's a bread.

4347
03:42:36,980 --> 03:42:38,460
And some cheese.

4348
03:42:39,360 --> 03:42:40,840
And some grapes.

4349
03:42:43,840 --> 03:42:45,140
Rage reducing cake.

4350
03:42:45,280 --> 03:42:46,480
It's my favorite cake ever.

4351
03:42:48,420 --> 03:42:49,460
It's so delicious.

4352
03:42:49,460 --> 03:42:52,040
But it's from a specific store.

4353
03:42:52,280 --> 03:42:54,100
So if I like ever move away...

4354
03:42:54,580 --> 03:42:56,220
I'll never be able to get it again.

4355
03:42:56,420 --> 03:42:56,700
You know?

4356
03:42:58,720 --> 03:43:00,700
It might be one of the only things keeping me here.

4357
03:43:02,220 --> 03:43:03,080
Nom nom.

4358
03:43:06,100 --> 03:43:07,180
Nom nom nom.

4359
03:43:09,140 --> 03:43:10,340
Nom nom nom.

4360
03:43:11,400 --> 03:43:11,840
Maybe...

4361
03:43:11,840 --> 03:43:12,220
Actually...

4362
03:43:12,220 --> 03:43:13,520
I'm gonna turn on some music.

4363
03:43:13,560 --> 03:43:14,660
So I'm not just...

4364
03:43:17,120 --> 03:43:17,560
Eating.

4365
03:43:18,940 --> 03:43:19,380
Oh!

4366
03:43:19,440 --> 03:43:20,300
This is...

4367
03:43:20,300 --> 03:43:21,540
This song is called Lemon Cake.

4368
03:43:21,920 --> 03:43:22,400
How...

4369
03:43:22,400 --> 03:43:22,820
How fitting.

4370
03:43:24,360 --> 03:43:25,020
Oh my god.

4371
03:43:25,060 --> 03:43:25,460
It's loud though.

4372
03:43:30,080 --> 03:43:30,560
Yummy.

4373
03:43:31,820 --> 03:43:32,300
Okay.

4374
03:43:34,240 --> 03:43:35,540
Just a short little...

4375
03:43:35,540 --> 03:43:36,120
Five minute...

4376
03:43:36,120 --> 03:43:36,640
Five...

4377
03:43:36,640 --> 03:43:37,480
Five middle...

4378
03:43:37,480 --> 03:43:38,480
Five minute break.

4379
03:43:38,760 --> 03:43:39,680
For me to eat.

4380
03:43:40,980 --> 03:43:42,260
I can barely open this.

4381
03:43:42,300 --> 03:43:43,200
My hands are starting to shake.

4382
03:43:43,540 --> 03:43:44,660
Because of the caffeine.

4383
03:43:46,360 --> 03:43:47,240
And also...

4384
03:43:47,240 --> 03:43:48,660
It's hard to open things anyway.

4385
03:43:48,720 --> 03:43:49,100
When you're...

4386
03:43:49,100 --> 03:43:49,280
Go!

4387
03:43:49,400 --> 03:43:49,420
Go!

4388
03:44:01,840 --> 03:44:02,680
You know?

4389
03:44:02,800 --> 03:44:04,060
I'm proud of how much...

4390
03:44:04,060 --> 03:44:05,240
Progress I've made so far.

4391
03:44:05,680 --> 03:44:06,880
Especially with stage 10.

4392
03:44:07,000 --> 03:44:08,020
I was really thinking...

4393
03:44:08,020 --> 03:44:09,160
It would be impossible.

4394
03:44:09,320 --> 03:44:10,380
And I've done it twice now.

4395
03:44:15,060 --> 03:44:16,440
So all in all...

4396
03:44:17,000 --> 03:44:17,420
Good.

4397
03:44:20,420 --> 03:44:22,140
You've honestly made it pretty far into the game.

4398
03:44:22,960 --> 03:44:23,920
And like...

4399
03:44:23,920 --> 03:44:25,000
It's been four hours.

4400
03:44:25,700 --> 03:44:27,260
But we've tried different routes.

4401
03:44:28,100 --> 03:44:28,580
So...

4402
03:44:32,200 --> 03:44:33,100
Platforming pretty well.

4403
03:44:33,280 --> 03:44:33,760
Yippee!

4404
03:44:35,020 --> 03:44:36,560
You're accidentally taking wrong routes.

4405
03:44:36,580 --> 03:44:37,260
More explanations.

4406
03:44:37,360 --> 03:44:37,740
So that's nice.

4407
03:44:37,800 --> 03:44:37,980
Yeah!

4408
03:44:38,100 --> 03:44:38,580
Exactly!

4409
03:44:39,380 --> 03:44:41,040
Do you want to try another Famicom Rage?

4410
03:44:41,040 --> 03:44:41,380
Kusoge?

4411
03:44:41,560 --> 03:44:43,740
Try Transformers Convoy no Nazo.

4412
03:44:47,000 --> 03:44:47,920
I can't remember.

4413
03:44:48,160 --> 03:44:49,340
Is Cheetah Man...

4414
03:44:49,340 --> 03:44:50,740
A kusoge?

4415
03:44:51,140 --> 03:44:51,620
I don't know.

4416
03:44:51,620 --> 03:44:51,660
I don't know.

4417
03:44:51,660 --> 03:44:51,680
I don't know.

4418
03:44:52,600 --> 03:44:53,900
Or is it just silly?

4419
03:44:54,220 --> 03:44:54,820
Beep!

4420
03:44:54,840 --> 03:44:55,080
Beep!

4421
03:44:55,100 --> 03:44:55,940
And this is also...

4422
03:44:55,940 --> 03:44:58,540
I want to play Ernest Evans too.

4423
03:45:04,520 --> 03:45:05,440
It's horrible.

4424
03:45:07,240 --> 03:45:07,840
Boop!

4425
03:45:07,940 --> 03:45:08,100
Boop!

4426
03:45:08,220 --> 03:45:08,500
Boop!

4427
03:45:08,520 --> 03:45:09,120
Boop!

4428
03:45:09,520 --> 03:45:10,120
Boop!

4429
03:45:10,120 --> 03:45:10,560
Boop!

4430
03:45:10,560 --> 03:45:11,020
Boop!

4431
03:45:11,320 --> 03:45:11,920
Boop!

4432
03:45:12,080 --> 03:45:12,200
Boop!

4433
03:45:13,040 --> 03:45:13,640
Boop!

4434
03:45:13,640 --> 03:45:13,940
Boop!

4435
03:45:13,940 --> 03:45:14,400
Boop!

4436
03:45:14,540 --> 03:45:14,600
Boop!

4437
03:45:17,970 --> 03:45:18,570
Boop!

4438
03:45:26,670 --> 03:45:27,270
Boop!

4439
03:45:29,010 --> 03:45:29,630
Uh-oh.

4440
03:45:31,050 --> 03:45:33,330
My music is on the other screen.

4441
03:45:34,250 --> 03:45:36,970
The one that's being occupied by the game.

4442
03:45:37,130 --> 03:45:37,370
So...

4443
03:45:37,370 --> 03:45:38,270
Okay.

4444
03:45:38,410 --> 03:45:39,070
I got it though.

4445
03:45:43,680 --> 03:45:46,520
I recommend Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout for NES.

4446
03:45:46,800 --> 03:45:46,920
Oh!

4447
03:45:59,160 --> 03:46:00,660
So bad he couldn't even finish it.

4448
03:46:03,560 --> 03:46:07,840
Could continue the Game Center CX Greatest Hits and play Quest of Key sometime.

4449
03:46:08,060 --> 03:46:08,540
I don't know.

4450
03:46:08,860 --> 03:46:09,320
Yeah.

4451
03:46:10,000 --> 03:46:10,940
I would like to.

4452
03:46:11,020 --> 03:46:18,960
I think, you know, in the journey to become a better gamer, you must start at the basics.

4453
03:46:20,140 --> 03:46:25,580
And honestly, this feels like a good starting base, you know?

4454
03:46:28,200 --> 03:46:31,560
When something is so unfair and so...

4455
03:46:32,200 --> 03:46:32,680
So...

4456
03:46:34,200 --> 03:46:34,680
Um...

4457
03:46:36,720 --> 03:46:37,680
I guess unfair.

4458
03:46:38,360 --> 03:46:38,840
It's unfair.

4459
03:46:38,860 --> 03:46:40,880
Something is so unfair and so precise.

4460
03:46:41,680 --> 03:46:42,740
I think it's...

4461
03:46:42,740 --> 03:46:43,820
It makes you...

4462
03:46:43,820 --> 03:46:45,400
It hones your skill as a gamer.

4463
03:46:46,100 --> 03:46:48,500
Don't forget your skills as a gamer.

4464
03:46:50,460 --> 03:46:52,240
So, Mario next?

4465
03:47:05,340 --> 03:47:07,420
I don't like Mario.

4466
03:47:07,840 --> 03:47:08,680
I'm tired.

4467
03:47:14,150 --> 03:47:27,310
Pretty sure I played... I played original Mario before I graduated and I was... I think... did I use save states?

4468
03:47:27,610 --> 03:47:28,770
If anybody remembers.

4469
03:47:29,170 --> 03:47:30,030
I think I did.

4470
03:47:31,330 --> 03:47:32,150
You did?

4471
03:47:32,290 --> 03:47:33,790
I played it, yeah.

4472
03:47:34,030 --> 03:47:35,350
I don't remember if I...

4473
03:47:37,670 --> 03:47:38,130
Yeah.

4474
03:47:38,850 --> 03:47:39,790
You're pretty good.

4475
03:47:39,950 --> 03:47:40,550
Hand gesture.

4476
03:47:41,530 --> 03:47:42,290
Thank you!

4477
03:47:42,410 --> 03:47:43,330
Thanks for one month!

4478
03:47:45,550 --> 03:47:46,470
But um...

4479
03:47:47,290 --> 03:47:47,750
Oh

4480
03:47:58,340 --> 03:47:58,660
my god.

4481
03:47:58,760 --> 03:47:59,600
That chicken salad.

4482
03:48:01,660 --> 03:48:02,380
Oh my god.

4483
03:48:09,850 --> 03:48:10,910
The texture of it?

4484
03:48:11,030 --> 03:48:12,530
The texture of it did not hit.

4485
03:48:12,990 --> 03:48:13,450
Oh.

4486
03:48:15,290 --> 03:48:18,270
Oh, I thought I was gonna... Oh, I thought I was gonna throw up for real.

4487
03:48:19,590 --> 03:48:21,690
Okay, no more... no more chicken salad.

4488
03:48:23,030 --> 03:48:25,090
I thought I was gonna throw up for real just now.

4489
03:48:25,210 --> 03:48:25,910
Oh my god.

4490
03:48:27,830 --> 03:48:28,830
Eat the cheese!

4491
03:48:28,970 --> 03:48:29,550
Eat the cheese!

4492
03:48:33,110 --> 03:48:33,830
Thank you!

4493
03:48:33,870 --> 03:48:34,130
Thank you!

4494
03:48:34,450 --> 03:48:34,750
Kiss!

4495
03:48:35,070 --> 03:48:35,470
Kiss!

4496
03:48:40,780 --> 03:48:43,220
Here's some cool story while you... while you listen.

4497
03:48:44,780 --> 03:48:48,380
I just finished Fallout 1, a very old CRPG game back in the day.

4498
03:48:48,640 --> 03:48:53,140
It was a rough experience, so since I just lost my progress yesterday, I had to play my older save.

4499
03:48:53,160 --> 03:48:54,580
It frustrated me though, but it's fine.

4500
03:48:54,580 --> 03:48:56,180
Congrats on... you finished it!

4501
03:48:56,320 --> 03:48:56,560
Congrats!

4502
03:49:00,700 --> 03:49:01,640
I um...

4503
03:49:02,400 --> 03:49:06,180
I have been watching... I think because of the Fallout show...

4504
03:49:07,380 --> 03:49:07,900
Um...

4505
03:49:08,560 --> 03:49:11,060
Hold on, I gotta restart the music.

4506
03:49:13,240 --> 03:49:13,760
Um...

4507
03:49:15,420 --> 03:49:16,760
Because of the show...

4508
03:49:18,640 --> 03:49:21,140
Um... I've seen a lot more videos about Fallout.

4509
03:49:23,280 --> 03:49:24,560
Um... I've seen a lot more videos about Fallout.

4510
03:49:24,560 --> 03:49:26,960
Like, creepiest, Fallout, Bunker...

4511
03:49:26,960 --> 03:49:28,280
And some of them are like...

4512
03:49:28,280 --> 03:49:32,720
Some of them have like... intrigued me enough to where I'm like, now I'm really interested in playing.

4513
03:49:33,700 --> 03:49:36,360
I don't know if I'll stream it though, but...

4514
03:49:40,320 --> 03:49:41,300
Fallout 1 is fantastic.

4515
03:49:43,380 --> 03:49:44,440
Oh yeah, the vaults!

4516
03:49:44,440 --> 03:49:44,840
That's what I meant.

4517
03:49:44,920 --> 03:49:45,780
That's what... yeah, yeah, yeah.

4518
03:49:46,180 --> 03:49:53,200
They're just like, this vault was creepy because it was an experiment to see how people reacted if this and this happened.

4519
03:49:53,340 --> 03:49:53,940
And I'm like, whoa!

4520
03:49:53,940 --> 03:49:54,100
Whoa!

4521
03:50:01,350 --> 03:50:03,170
I would love to watch you play Fallout.

4522
03:50:03,710 --> 03:50:05,150
I know nothing about it.

4523
03:50:06,790 --> 03:50:09,230
Except... only what I've heard from those videos.

4524
03:50:23,240 --> 03:50:26,680
You said you couldn't play single game without... single player game without chat though?

4525
03:50:26,900 --> 03:50:28,020
It's not that I can't.

4526
03:50:28,860 --> 03:50:29,800
It's just more fun.

4527
03:50:30,360 --> 03:50:32,860
I find that I enjoy the game more when I...

4528
03:50:33,860 --> 03:50:35,580
When I... um...

4529
03:50:40,870 --> 03:50:43,610
When I play with the chat and you guys...

4530
03:50:44,570 --> 03:50:45,370
Reacting and...

4531
03:50:45,890 --> 03:50:46,850
Us having fun together.

4532
03:50:47,290 --> 03:50:51,370
That's why I feel like, even with this, I'm not raging so much because I'm like...

4533
03:50:51,890 --> 03:50:52,570
Silly game.

4534
03:50:57,470 --> 03:50:59,710
I have some cheese left over.

4535
03:50:59,890 --> 03:51:00,290
Maybe...

4536
03:51:00,890 --> 03:51:02,690
Okay, I'm gonna have one bite of cake.

4537
03:51:02,930 --> 03:51:03,710
For motivation.

4538
03:51:09,470 --> 03:51:10,690
Open the cake.

4539
03:51:11,230 --> 03:51:13,830
Not a kusage but I think you'd get a kick out of Haunting Ground.

4540
03:51:14,110 --> 03:51:16,850
Daniella is a very amazing spooky maid!

4541
03:51:17,830 --> 03:51:18,450
Like me!

4542
03:51:18,910 --> 03:51:22,430
Since you asked about GameCube stuff too, PN03's Vanessa is also good.

4543
03:51:22,550 --> 03:51:23,070
Oh, thank you!

4544
03:51:23,390 --> 03:51:24,650
Oh, look at the Haunting Ground.

4545
03:51:24,770 --> 03:51:25,570
I think I've heard of that.

4546
03:51:26,270 --> 03:51:26,690
Um...

4547
03:51:27,290 --> 03:51:29,010
Oh my god, speaking of spooky maids.

4548
03:51:29,130 --> 03:51:30,870
At... at Disney...

4549
03:51:33,070 --> 03:51:34,170
At Tokyo Disney.

4550
03:51:34,430 --> 03:51:38,310
I don't know if it's American Disney too, but for the Haunted House ride...

4551
03:51:38,310 --> 03:51:40,130
They had, um...

4552
03:51:40,130 --> 03:51:42,310
They had Mickey Mouse ears...

4553
03:51:42,310 --> 03:51:43,510
That were...

4554
03:51:43,510 --> 03:51:45,510
I don't even actually know if they were just ears.

4555
03:51:46,030 --> 03:51:47,810
But they were, um...

4556
03:51:48,690 --> 03:51:49,650
The girls...

4557
03:51:49,650 --> 03:51:52,050
The girls at the Haunted Mansion...

4558
03:51:52,750 --> 03:51:54,310
That run the ride...

4559
03:51:54,310 --> 03:51:56,570
They're dressed up as, like, ghost maids.

4560
03:51:56,970 --> 03:51:58,350
And they're just so cute!

4561
03:51:58,490 --> 03:52:00,330
And they sold their headbands.

4562
03:52:00,750 --> 03:52:01,450
I don't know.

4563
03:52:01,490 --> 03:52:01,890
I hope...

4564
03:52:01,890 --> 03:52:02,750
I don't know if it was like...

4565
03:52:02,750 --> 03:52:04,310
If they sell it year round or...

4566
03:52:05,530 --> 03:52:07,310
If it was just a Halloween thing one year.

4567
03:52:07,390 --> 03:52:08,290
But I saw someone wearing it.

4568
03:52:09,050 --> 03:52:09,490
And...

4569
03:52:09,490 --> 03:52:10,570
It was so cute!

4570
03:52:11,190 --> 03:52:13,590
And I searched the park, but I couldn't find one.

4571
03:52:13,670 --> 03:52:13,790
But...

4572
03:52:13,790 --> 03:52:15,290
Oh my gosh, it's really cute!

4573
03:52:15,810 --> 03:52:16,570
I search...

4574
03:52:16,570 --> 03:52:17,370
I recommend...

4575
03:52:17,370 --> 03:52:19,230
Look up the Haunted House...

4576
03:52:19,230 --> 03:52:20,610
Haunted Mansion...

4577
03:52:21,730 --> 03:52:22,170
Maids...

4578
03:52:22,170 --> 03:52:22,830
At Tokyo Disney.

4579
03:52:25,410 --> 03:52:26,490
They're so cute!

4580
03:52:31,950 --> 03:52:33,730
They dress as the maids and butlers?

4581
03:52:33,830 --> 03:52:34,170
Oh, they do?

4582
03:52:36,210 --> 03:52:37,210
Might be the same then.

4583
03:52:37,210 --> 03:52:37,470
Okay.

4584
03:52:37,950 --> 03:52:38,930
I had one bite.

4585
03:52:38,970 --> 03:52:39,830
I'm having one other bite.

4586
03:52:40,070 --> 03:52:40,390
Wow.

4587
03:52:44,410 --> 03:52:45,230
It's so yummy.

4588
03:52:49,530 --> 03:52:49,850
Wait.

4589
03:52:49,970 --> 03:52:50,930
I should go put this in the fridge.

4590
03:52:54,110 --> 03:52:55,450
I'm gonna go put this back in the fridge.

4591
03:52:55,510 --> 03:52:56,190
So it doesn't...

4592
03:52:56,730 --> 03:52:58,110
Doesn't get warm and melt.

4593
03:52:58,570 --> 03:52:58,890
Okay.

4594
03:52:58,990 --> 03:52:59,850
I'll be right back.

4595
03:53:01,950 --> 03:53:02,830
Just a little bit.

4596
03:53:02,890 --> 03:53:04,210
Also, I'm gonna get more water.

4597
03:53:04,310 --> 03:53:04,630
So...

4598
03:53:05,750 --> 03:53:06,450
I'll be right back.

4599
03:53:06,470 --> 03:53:06,930
One more time.

4600
03:53:06,990 --> 03:53:07,190
Sorry.

4601
03:53:07,190 --> 03:53:07,390
Sorry!!

4602
03:53:07,390 --> 03:53:07,510
Sorry.

4603
03:53:07,530 --> 03:53:07,650
Sorry.

4604
03:53:07,650 --> 03:53:07,770
Sorry!

4605
03:53:07,770 --> 03:53:07,790
Sorry.

4606
03:53:08,530 --> 03:53:09,770
I'm

4607
03:54:03,460 --> 03:54:03,980
back!

4608
03:54:04,600 --> 03:54:06,040
And I'm ready!

4609
03:54:06,860 --> 03:54:08,160
RANGE METER!

4610
03:54:09,340 --> 03:54:10,580
DECREASE!

4611
03:54:14,420 --> 03:54:15,040
Calculating...

4612
03:54:15,840 --> 03:54:16,460
CULATING...

4613
03:54:16,460 --> 03:54:17,100
PERCENT.

4614
03:54:18,880 --> 03:54:20,200
4 PERCENT!

4615
03:54:20,880 --> 03:54:24,740
3 PERCENT!

4616
03:54:24,840 --> 03:54:28,640
2 PERCENT!

4617
03:54:29,780 --> 03:54:30,400
K?

4618
03:54:34,340 --> 03:54:35,540
Nice, alrighty.

4619
03:54:36,980 --> 03:54:37,920
Are we ready?

4620
03:54:48,130 --> 03:55:20,760
Now we know how to get to level four and from there we don't know what we're doing but we will figure it out because we are super smart and we will get it right on the first first try and we won't get it wrong and we also won't die oh yeah take that take that yeah take that take that

4621
03:55:29,220 --> 03:55:36,100
is it weird to be having so much fun with this game And when it's supposed to be like a rage game.

4622
03:55:39,420 --> 03:55:41,700
Drop down, drop down.

4623
03:55:42,140 --> 03:55:42,720
There we go.

4624
03:55:43,760 --> 03:55:45,140
Better to be safe than sorry.

4625
03:55:46,420 --> 03:55:47,280
A little.

4626
03:55:48,540 --> 03:55:50,260
Maybe I have gone insane.

4627
03:55:52,420 --> 03:55:53,760
Maybe I've gone insane.

4628
03:55:55,040 --> 03:55:55,680
Fish!

4629
03:55:57,220 --> 03:55:58,920
Fish, f-f-f-fish.

4630
03:55:59,700 --> 03:56:01,020
It's a fish.

4631
03:56:01,500 --> 03:56:02,220
It's a fish.

4632
03:56:03,360 --> 03:56:03,840
Fish.

4633
03:56:04,480 --> 03:56:05,780
Oh, it's a fish.

4634
03:56:06,640 --> 03:56:07,120
Fishy.

4635
03:56:07,700 --> 03:56:08,500
It's a fish.

4636
03:56:10,420 --> 03:56:11,920
But you've got fall.

4637
03:56:14,840 --> 03:56:17,640
You guys, I recently learned that there's...

4638
03:56:17,640 --> 03:56:19,680
Okay, so I always knew that I couldn't burp.

4639
03:56:21,060 --> 03:56:21,900
It's this one, right?

4640
03:56:22,480 --> 03:56:22,960
Yeah.

4641
03:56:23,040 --> 03:56:27,540
I always knew that I couldn't burp, but I recently learned that there's a thing for it.

4642
03:56:29,640 --> 03:56:30,820
It's called like...

4643
03:56:31,020 --> 03:56:32,380
I don't remember what it's called actually.

4644
03:56:33,400 --> 03:56:33,880
But...

4645
03:56:34,500 --> 03:56:35,760
I can't burp.

4646
03:56:35,760 --> 03:56:36,460
I can only...

4647
03:56:36,460 --> 03:56:38,580
I only make a weird sound in my throat.

4648
03:56:39,860 --> 03:56:40,880
It's really weird.

4649
03:56:45,500 --> 03:56:45,980
Sorry.

4650
03:56:46,080 --> 03:56:50,060
I thought about it because it just happened where my throat was like...

4651
03:56:51,000 --> 03:56:52,220
And I was like...

4652
03:56:53,220 --> 03:56:54,760
I learned that that's a thing.

4653
03:56:58,270 --> 03:57:00,710
I'm actually incapable of burping.

4654
03:57:01,570 --> 03:57:02,830
I've never burped once.

4655
03:57:02,970 --> 03:57:03,970
Maybe as a baby.

4656
03:57:03,970 --> 03:57:04,810
But...

4657
03:57:06,070 --> 03:57:06,810
I don't even...

4658
03:57:06,810 --> 03:57:07,230
I try.

4659
03:57:07,690 --> 03:57:08,630
People will be like...

4660
03:57:08,630 --> 03:57:08,890
Just...

4661
03:57:08,890 --> 03:57:10,510
I don't even know how to do it.

4662
03:57:10,650 --> 03:57:11,730
They're like, try.

4663
03:57:11,910 --> 03:57:12,510
And I'm like...

4664
03:57:15,170 --> 03:57:16,210
Oh my god.

4665
03:57:16,630 --> 03:57:18,170
I need to pay attention a little bit more.

4666
03:57:21,770 --> 03:57:25,930
Have you also ever tried screaming after you let all the air out of your body?

4667
03:57:48,900 --> 03:57:50,120
She's gonna pass out.

4668
03:58:06,660 --> 03:58:08,200
That was so unfair.

4669
03:58:10,440 --> 03:58:11,120
No!

4670
03:58:15,400 --> 03:58:17,140
I did everything!

4671
03:58:23,360 --> 03:58:24,720
Actually rubbed.

4672
03:58:24,880 --> 03:58:26,320
Oh my goodness.

4673
03:58:26,580 --> 03:58:27,260
Nice.

4674
03:58:33,150 --> 03:58:34,410
Was it because...

4675
03:58:34,410 --> 03:58:35,190
Where did I...

4676
03:58:35,190 --> 03:58:35,830
Where did I...

4677
03:58:35,830 --> 03:58:37,730
I actually don't know where I...

4678
03:58:37,730 --> 03:58:40,450
Took too long on, to be honest.

4679
03:58:42,330 --> 03:58:44,110
Everything is starting to like...

4680
03:58:44,110 --> 03:58:44,590
Blur together.

4681
03:58:44,590 --> 03:58:47,290
And it's just becoming muscle memory at this point.

4682
03:58:48,610 --> 03:58:49,130
Oh...

4683
03:58:53,120 --> 03:58:53,640
Oh!

4684
03:58:53,700 --> 03:58:53,720
Ahh!

4685
03:59:01,380 --> 03:59:03,020
I hate level 8.

4686
03:59:05,660 --> 03:59:07,940
I think I hate this level more than I hate 10.

4687
03:59:10,000 --> 03:59:13,180
I think I hate this level more than I hate 10.

4688
03:59:13,760 --> 03:59:14,780
Quite honestly.

4689
03:59:32,800 --> 03:59:34,100
Okay, we made it here.

4690
03:59:34,780 --> 03:59:35,300
I'm excited.

4691
03:59:35,300 --> 03:59:35,460
Oh.

4692
03:59:47,280 --> 03:59:48,500
Please leave.

4693
04:00:06,360 --> 04:00:06,800
Okay.

4694
04:00:07,400 --> 04:00:08,680
Zone 10!

4695
04:00:11,560 --> 04:00:12,000
Okay.

4696
04:00:17,320 --> 04:00:20,800
Alright, guys.

4697
04:00:23,940 --> 04:00:24,920
We can do this.

4698
04:00:30,170 --> 04:00:31,970
We can do this!

4699
04:00:39,720 --> 04:00:41,920
That's not what I wanted to do, but that works.

4700
04:00:42,980 --> 04:00:43,580
Okay.

4701
04:00:45,220 --> 04:00:46,840
BGM that burns your brain.

4702
04:00:47,140 --> 04:00:51,460
There's like two soundtracks in this... two songs in this game.

4703
04:00:59,990 --> 04:01:01,590
But we're getting better.

4704
04:01:02,250 --> 04:01:03,230
We're getting better.

4705
04:01:08,770 --> 04:01:09,370
Nice.

4706
04:01:15,150 --> 04:01:15,930
No.

4707
04:01:15,970 --> 04:01:16,230
Oh.

4708
04:01:16,350 --> 04:01:18,750
Oh my god!

4709
04:01:19,510 --> 04:01:21,130
Oh my god...

4710
04:01:21,130 --> 04:01:21,750
Duh duh duh.

4711
04:01:22,050 --> 04:01:22,690
Hoi.

4712
04:01:22,750 --> 04:01:23,190
Yah.

4713
04:01:25,830 --> 04:01:26,610
Gah.

4714
04:01:27,510 --> 04:01:28,290
Hoi.

4715
04:01:28,950 --> 04:01:29,730
GAAAAH!

4716
04:01:39,840 --> 04:01:41,660
I hate level 10.

4717
04:01:41,740 --> 04:01:44,040
I do hate level 8 more than 10, though.

4718
04:01:46,560 --> 04:01:47,340
Hoi.

4719
04:01:49,600 --> 04:01:50,360
Hoi.

4720
04:01:51,280 --> 04:01:52,060
Hoi.

4721
04:01:52,120 --> 04:01:52,680
Hoi.

4722
04:01:52,680 --> 04:01:53,160
Hoi.

4723
04:01:54,400 --> 04:01:54,800
Hoi.

4724
04:01:54,920 --> 04:01:55,180
Ah.

4725
04:01:56,020 --> 04:01:56,420
Hoi.

4726
04:01:57,960 --> 04:01:58,780
I'm so good.

4727
04:02:04,380 --> 04:02:05,780
Though will I run out of time?

4728
04:02:05,820 --> 04:02:05,980
No.

4729
04:02:07,820 --> 04:02:08,620
Who knows.

4730
04:02:09,340 --> 04:02:11,400
I think I did that relatively quickly, though.

4731
04:02:13,820 --> 04:02:14,220
Okay.

4732
04:02:18,470 --> 04:02:20,050
I think I did that relatively...

4733
04:02:20,050 --> 04:02:22,430
Okay, so going to the third one is like ideal.

4734
04:02:29,260 --> 04:02:32,080
I wanted to see if I could do it for the second one.

4735
04:02:33,320 --> 04:02:34,840
I wanted to see...

4736
04:02:35,840 --> 04:02:37,620
I wanted to see...

4737
04:02:45,090 --> 04:02:47,050
Are you kidding me?

4738
04:02:49,910 --> 04:02:52,290
Are you kidding me right now?

4739
04:02:57,860 --> 04:02:59,880
Are you kidding me?

4740
04:03:02,600 --> 04:03:03,240
Please.

4741
04:03:03,880 --> 04:03:05,700
Mr. John Atlantis.

4742
04:03:16,800 --> 04:03:18,920
Please, Mr. John Atlantis.

4743
04:03:19,000 --> 04:03:20,400
Just use your feet.

4744
04:03:20,680 --> 04:03:22,020
Grab it with your toes.

4745
04:03:25,320 --> 04:03:26,180
There we go.

4746
04:03:26,380 --> 04:03:26,780
Okay.

4747
04:03:30,780 --> 04:03:31,420
Acquired.

4748
04:03:31,920 --> 04:03:32,560
Oh.

4749
04:03:32,860 --> 04:03:33,980
That was close.

4750
04:03:37,520 --> 04:03:38,160
Okay.

4751
04:03:41,000 --> 04:03:41,440
Cloud.

4752
04:03:45,300 --> 04:03:45,740
Nice.

4753
04:03:46,020 --> 04:03:46,980
There we go.

4754
04:03:47,140 --> 04:03:47,800
There we go.

4755
04:03:47,860 --> 04:03:48,240
There we go.

4756
04:03:49,880 --> 04:03:50,320
Oh.

4757
04:03:50,560 --> 04:03:51,900
I didn't think I was going to make that.

4758
04:03:57,200 --> 04:03:57,640
Yippee.

4759
04:04:01,400 --> 04:04:01,840
Wrong.

4760
04:04:05,810 --> 04:04:06,250
Oh.

4761
04:04:06,710 --> 04:04:07,150
Actually...

4762
04:04:07,150 --> 04:04:07,970
Wait.

4763
04:04:08,090 --> 04:04:09,310
I have to go through here first.

4764
04:04:11,170 --> 04:04:12,490
I have to go through here first.

4765
04:04:16,560 --> 04:04:17,460
Do I have...

4766
04:04:17,460 --> 04:04:17,640
Oh.

4767
04:04:17,700 --> 04:04:18,960
I only have one life.

4768
04:04:19,260 --> 04:04:19,760
Oh.

4769
04:04:19,900 --> 04:04:20,860
You guys.

4770
04:04:21,740 --> 04:04:22,760
You guys.

4771
04:04:24,020 --> 04:04:24,580
Oh.

4772
04:04:25,780 --> 04:04:27,020
This is not good.

4773
04:04:29,220 --> 04:04:31,360
This is not looking very good for me.

4774
04:04:31,460 --> 04:04:31,660
Okay.

4775
04:04:31,720 --> 04:04:32,300
Fourth zone.

4776
04:04:33,700 --> 04:04:34,580
Fourth zone.

4777
04:04:34,680 --> 04:04:35,060
We're...

4778
04:04:35,060 --> 04:04:35,720
We're...

4779
04:04:35,720 --> 04:04:36,720
Okay.

4780
04:04:36,780 --> 04:04:37,900
Go this way instead.

4781
04:04:38,620 --> 04:04:39,180
Okay.

4782
04:04:39,320 --> 04:04:39,640
Okay.

4783
04:04:40,060 --> 04:04:41,180
Oh, no.

4784
04:04:41,340 --> 04:04:41,620
Okay.

4785
04:04:46,770 --> 04:04:47,610
I can make it.

4786
04:04:47,610 --> 04:04:48,370
I can make it with this.

4787
04:04:48,570 --> 04:04:48,630
Okay.

4788
04:05:13,820 --> 04:05:14,420
It's okay.

4789
04:05:15,540 --> 04:05:17,840
I know the secret for stage 10 now.

4790
04:05:20,220 --> 04:05:21,240
I know...

4791
04:05:21,240 --> 04:05:23,540
I know how to get through stage 10 now.

4792
04:05:23,840 --> 04:05:28,980
NES video games are proof that people used to need to jump more to get around in their daily life.

4793
04:05:29,920 --> 04:05:30,440
Yes.

4794
04:05:30,900 --> 04:05:32,560
This is historically accurate.

4795
04:05:36,390 --> 04:05:38,730
This is extremely historically accurate.

4796
04:05:39,670 --> 04:05:40,410
Oh my god.

4797
04:05:40,410 --> 04:05:40,610
Wait.

4798
04:05:40,770 --> 04:05:41,750
That was close.

4799
04:05:43,650 --> 04:05:44,270
Wait.

4800
04:05:47,880 --> 04:05:49,080
Hey, get out of here.

4801
04:05:50,740 --> 04:05:51,320
Oh.

4802
04:05:51,960 --> 04:05:52,720
All right.

4803
04:05:52,780 --> 04:05:53,400
John Atlantis.

4804
04:05:55,360 --> 04:06:00,280
Claim your title as the one true Atlantis king.

4805
04:06:05,070 --> 04:06:05,690
Okay.

4806
04:06:06,530 --> 04:06:07,770
This goes to three.

4807
04:06:09,770 --> 04:06:10,390
Three.

4808
04:06:10,470 --> 04:06:11,790
We go to six.

4809
04:06:13,190 --> 04:06:13,810
Then...

4810
04:06:13,810 --> 04:06:14,170
Then...

4811
04:06:14,170 --> 04:06:14,330
Then...

4812
04:06:14,330 --> 04:06:14,470
Then...

4813
04:06:16,390 --> 04:06:17,350
Fish incoming.

4814
04:06:22,010 --> 04:06:22,970
Fish incoming.

4815
04:06:27,290 --> 04:06:28,430
We'll let this guy fall.

4816
04:06:29,330 --> 04:06:29,810
Fish.

4817
04:06:41,400 --> 04:06:43,540
Why is the fish from another direction?

4818
04:06:45,740 --> 04:06:46,220
I

4819
04:06:52,390 --> 04:06:55,050
thought the fish was going to be from another direction now.

4820
04:06:55,830 --> 04:06:58,570
I thought the fish was going to be another direction now.

4821
04:06:58,690 --> 04:06:59,110
We're out of time.

4822
04:06:59,130 --> 04:06:59,450
Noooo!

4823
04:07:02,350 --> 04:07:03,310
Fish incoming!

4824
04:07:07,650 --> 04:07:08,530
Let him drop.

4825
04:07:09,370 --> 04:07:10,330
Fish incoming!

4826
04:07:15,030 --> 04:07:16,990
I'm gonna start throwing them the opposite direction.

4827
04:07:18,490 --> 04:07:20,170
I came up with that in my brain.

4828
04:07:20,350 --> 04:07:22,770
I was like, wait a second, why am I throwing it towards them?

4829
04:07:22,870 --> 04:07:26,010
And then risking myself getting blown up if they stop.

4830
04:07:31,230 --> 04:07:32,830
Only four lives left.

4831
04:07:33,170 --> 04:07:34,950
Oh, this is so bad, you guys!

4832
04:07:37,350 --> 04:07:37,830
Please.

4833
04:07:38,270 --> 04:07:39,150
I need you.

4834
04:07:43,190 --> 04:07:45,330
Four lives left for level eight?

4835
04:07:45,950 --> 04:07:46,810
It's not good.

4836
04:07:47,090 --> 04:07:48,050
This is not looking good.

4837
04:07:50,190 --> 04:07:52,030
This is not looking good, you guys.

4838
04:07:52,150 --> 04:07:53,350
This is not looking good.

4839
04:08:06,120 --> 04:08:08,080
Once we get the star, it doesn't matter anyway.

4840
04:08:08,160 --> 04:08:10,340
It does matter if I can't jump either!

4841
04:08:11,780 --> 04:08:13,900
I tried throwing the bomb and...

4842
04:08:14,520 --> 04:08:15,040
Okay.

4843
04:08:16,920 --> 04:08:17,660
Redo time.

4844
04:08:18,000 --> 04:08:19,220
It's time to redo.

4845
04:08:19,760 --> 04:08:20,920
It's time to redo.

4846
04:08:21,020 --> 04:08:21,680
There's no way.

4847
04:08:26,300 --> 04:08:27,840
These are all practice runs.

4848
04:08:37,810 --> 04:08:40,050
Sometimes in life, we regress a little bit.

4849
04:08:41,470 --> 04:08:42,450
Or in afterlife.

4850
04:08:44,070 --> 04:08:44,590
Okay.

4851
04:08:44,930 --> 04:08:45,450
Okay.

4852
04:08:45,590 --> 04:08:47,070
That's okay, that was only stage eight.

4853
04:08:48,530 --> 04:08:50,830
Eight out of 99, baby!

4854
04:08:54,130 --> 04:08:55,630
No worries here.

4855
04:08:56,590 --> 04:08:57,550
No worries here.

4856
04:08:59,010 --> 04:09:00,290
No worries here.

4857
04:09:02,650 --> 04:09:04,070
Eight out of 99.

4858
04:09:08,490 --> 04:09:10,450
Should do this game for GDQ.

4859
04:09:10,790 --> 04:09:13,470
I would love to participate in a GDQ one day.

4860
04:09:13,610 --> 04:09:15,370
But like...

4861
04:09:16,290 --> 04:09:17,110
Oh god.

4862
04:09:17,210 --> 04:09:17,590
Oh my god.

4863
04:09:17,590 --> 04:09:18,150
Oh my god.

4864
04:09:18,270 --> 04:09:18,610
Oh my god.

4865
04:09:18,730 --> 04:09:19,750
But I...

4866
04:09:19,750 --> 04:09:21,250
Me speedrunning anything?

4867
04:09:22,490 --> 04:09:24,090
I don't see that happening.

4868
04:09:36,220 --> 04:09:40,180
Maybe I could organize a VTubers games thing.

4869
04:09:40,940 --> 04:09:42,080
Oh my god, go go go!

4870
04:09:52,360 --> 04:09:53,900
I'm regressing right now.

4871
04:09:54,820 --> 04:09:55,820
Fish incoming!

4872
04:10:01,140 --> 04:10:02,240
Wait for the fish.

4873
04:10:02,380 --> 04:10:03,100
Fish incoming!

4874
04:10:06,640 --> 04:10:07,840
Let this guy die.

4875
04:10:08,480 --> 04:10:09,400
Fish incoming!

4876
04:10:14,550 --> 04:10:15,590
Fish incoming!

4877
04:10:19,520 --> 04:10:20,360
This one, right?

4878
04:10:20,760 --> 04:10:21,280
Yes.

4879
04:10:23,780 --> 04:10:25,360
Games done not so quick.

4880
04:10:27,980 --> 04:10:30,840
Ba da da bop ba da da bop ba da da bop!

4881
04:10:38,510 --> 04:10:42,610
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da...

4882
04:10:42,610 --> 04:10:43,490
Oh my gosh.

4883
04:10:43,930 --> 04:10:44,810
Come on, jump.

4884
04:10:45,310 --> 04:10:45,830
Hoi!

4885
04:10:51,320 --> 04:10:52,040
Please.

4886
04:10:52,220 --> 04:10:52,520
Please.

4887
04:10:52,520 --> 04:10:54,040
I am pressing A.

4888
04:10:54,200 --> 04:10:55,640
I am pressing A.

4889
04:10:56,520 --> 04:10:57,900
I am pressing A.

4890
04:10:58,160 --> 04:10:59,300
Just uh...

4891
04:10:59,300 --> 04:11:00,660
You know.

4892
04:11:02,020 --> 04:11:03,560
Oh, this is a lag.

4893
04:11:04,140 --> 04:11:04,880
No, I'm just kidding.

4894
04:11:09,050 --> 04:11:10,070
Oh, please.

4895
04:11:16,720 --> 04:11:17,440
Okay.

4896
04:11:17,520 --> 04:11:18,140
Hoi.

4897
04:11:19,100 --> 04:11:19,820
Ah.

4898
04:11:19,920 --> 04:11:20,580
Huh.

4899
04:11:20,660 --> 04:11:21,100
Yah.

4900
04:11:21,440 --> 04:11:22,120
Huh.

4901
04:11:22,180 --> 04:11:22,740
Yah.

4902
04:11:23,120 --> 04:11:23,800
Okay.

4903
04:11:24,600 --> 04:11:25,860
I'll let this guy go.

4904
04:11:26,060 --> 04:11:26,780
Okay.

4905
04:11:27,100 --> 04:11:27,820
Okay.

4906
04:11:38,590 --> 04:11:39,410
Please.

4907
04:11:39,450 --> 04:11:39,930
Please, please.

4908
04:11:39,950 --> 04:11:40,890
I need the speed.

4909
04:11:43,050 --> 04:11:43,490
Huh.

4910
04:11:43,650 --> 04:11:44,130
Oh, gosh.

4911
04:11:44,330 --> 04:11:45,550
I thought I was gonna land in there.

4912
04:11:47,550 --> 04:11:48,450
First try, baby!

4913
04:11:50,970 --> 04:11:51,410
Yeah!

4914
04:11:53,270 --> 04:11:53,710
Ha.

4915
04:12:02,110 --> 04:12:03,250
I knew that was...

4916
04:12:03,250 --> 04:12:03,550
I knew.

4917
04:12:03,590 --> 04:12:03,750
I...

4918
04:12:03,750 --> 04:12:04,450
I knew.

4919
04:12:05,750 --> 04:12:10,110
I knew at the moment that I had gone too far.

4920
04:12:10,710 --> 04:12:11,570
I knew it.

4921
04:12:11,650 --> 04:12:12,070
I knew it.

4922
04:12:13,390 --> 04:12:13,830
I knew.

4923
04:12:14,490 --> 04:12:14,930
That was...

4924
04:12:14,930 --> 04:12:16,390
I knew in the moment.

4925
04:12:46,900 --> 04:12:48,160
Do points matter?

4926
04:12:48,480 --> 04:12:50,680
I believe if you get enough points...

4927
04:12:50,680 --> 04:12:52,120
you get an extra life.

4928
04:12:53,560 --> 04:12:54,200
So...

4929
04:12:55,440 --> 04:12:56,720
It is good...

4930
04:12:56,720 --> 04:12:57,320
to have.

4931
04:12:57,860 --> 04:12:59,680
It's good to get them when you can.

4932
04:13:01,140 --> 04:13:02,420
Yes indeed.

4933
04:13:16,790 --> 04:13:17,790
There we go.

4934
04:13:18,570 --> 04:13:19,410
Yes.

4935
04:13:19,410 --> 04:13:19,750
Yes.

4936
04:13:20,330 --> 04:13:20,750
Yes.

4937
04:13:30,850 --> 04:13:31,830
Oh wait.

4938
04:13:32,270 --> 04:13:33,290
My bad.

4939
04:13:34,950 --> 04:13:35,370
Okay.

4940
04:13:35,750 --> 04:13:36,590
Alright.

4941
04:13:36,890 --> 04:13:37,730
Alrighty.

4942
04:13:39,010 --> 04:13:39,430
Okay.

4943
04:13:46,160 --> 04:13:47,960
F you chest.

4944
04:14:01,540 --> 04:14:02,380
Alright.

4945
04:14:02,380 --> 04:14:03,640
I think...

4946
04:14:06,540 --> 04:14:07,700
This is like...

4947
04:14:07,700 --> 04:14:08,980
the safest way to get down.

4948
04:14:11,580 --> 04:14:11,920
Okay.

4949
04:14:12,680 --> 04:14:12,880
Okay.

4950
04:14:14,960 --> 04:14:16,180
It's the safest.

4951
04:14:16,340 --> 04:14:17,680
It's the actually safest way...

4952
04:14:17,680 --> 04:14:18,100
to get down.

4953
04:14:19,480 --> 04:14:19,820
No!

4954
04:14:22,100 --> 04:14:23,180
I didn't...

4955
04:14:23,180 --> 04:14:24,440
I didn't jump...

4956
04:14:24,440 --> 04:14:25,760
soon enough.

4957
04:14:32,100 --> 04:14:34,040
I lost the star!

4958
04:14:37,520 --> 04:14:38,220
I have to redo everything.

4959
04:14:49,950 --> 04:14:51,590
I have to redo everything.

4960
04:14:54,110 --> 04:14:54,710
I have to redo everything.

4961
04:15:00,430 --> 04:15:01,630
Oh yeah.

4962
04:15:02,430 --> 04:15:03,210
I'm gonna die here.

4963
04:15:04,030 --> 04:15:04,630
Maybe.

4964
04:15:04,930 --> 04:15:06,030
Actually I don't...

4965
04:15:06,030 --> 04:15:07,510
Are you coming over here or what?

4966
04:15:12,200 --> 04:15:13,540
Keep pushing forward.

4967
04:15:14,480 --> 04:15:15,260
You know what?

4968
04:15:15,300 --> 04:15:16,360
Maybe I can try...

4969
04:15:16,740 --> 04:15:17,300
Oops.

4970
04:15:18,240 --> 04:15:18,980
Dang it.

4971
04:15:20,140 --> 04:15:21,780
Maybe I can try level...

4972
04:15:22,300 --> 04:15:22,780
four...

4973
04:15:24,060 --> 04:15:26,080
without infinity to see...

4974
04:15:26,080 --> 04:15:26,540
um...

4975
04:15:28,080 --> 04:15:29,040
to see...

4976
04:15:30,440 --> 04:15:31,900
But we need infinity...

4977
04:15:31,900 --> 04:15:32,780
for the last level.

4978
04:15:32,900 --> 04:15:34,340
But we can see where the next...

4979
04:15:34,340 --> 04:15:35,300
where the door is.

4980
04:15:35,400 --> 04:15:35,880
You know what I mean?

4981
04:15:38,540 --> 04:15:40,160
Where the door is...

4982
04:15:40,160 --> 04:15:40,800
to the next part.

4983
04:15:41,600 --> 04:15:42,080
Maybe.

4984
04:15:42,280 --> 04:15:42,980
If we're good.

4985
04:15:45,040 --> 04:15:46,220
So let's at least try.

4986
04:15:52,370 --> 04:15:53,850
I don't know where the... duck.

4987
04:15:55,070 --> 04:15:55,550
Duck.

4988
04:15:56,390 --> 04:15:56,870
Oh

4989
04:16:05,630 --> 04:16:05,770
no!

4990
04:16:05,930 --> 04:16:06,490
Oh my god.

4991
04:16:06,590 --> 04:16:07,010
Oh my god.

4992
04:16:16,430 --> 04:16:16,910
Gaming.

4993
04:16:23,560 --> 04:16:24,040
Gaming.

4994
04:16:26,820 --> 04:16:27,600
It's right here!

4995
04:16:40,470 --> 04:16:41,430
Oh god.

4996
04:16:46,900 --> 04:16:47,640
This part.

4997
04:16:48,040 --> 04:16:48,680
Um... hello?

4998
04:16:48,920 --> 04:16:49,960
I don't think this is possible.

4999
04:16:51,620 --> 04:16:52,340
Oh my gosh.

5000
04:16:52,460 --> 04:16:52,980
I made it.

5001
04:16:53,460 --> 04:16:53,860
Okay.

5002
04:16:53,980 --> 04:16:54,240
Okay.

5003
04:17:00,280 --> 04:17:01,500
So it's just a few over.

5004
04:17:02,040 --> 04:17:03,740
As long as I can make the jump.

5005
04:17:04,540 --> 04:17:05,120
Oh duck.

5006
04:17:05,240 --> 04:17:06,160
Duck duck duck duck duck!

5007
04:17:06,320 --> 04:17:06,820
Oh my god.

5008
04:17:07,660 --> 04:17:08,060
Ah!

5009
04:17:10,360 --> 04:17:11,500
I jumped too...

5010
04:17:11,500 --> 04:17:12,180
late?

5011
04:17:14,860 --> 04:17:15,660
Oh... gosh.

5012
04:17:22,520 --> 04:17:22,920
Duck!

5013
04:17:24,220 --> 04:17:24,620
Wait.

5014
04:17:25,080 --> 04:17:25,480
Wait.

5015
04:17:26,700 --> 04:17:27,100
Wait.

5016
04:17:27,100 --> 04:17:27,860
I'm surprised...

5017
04:17:27,880 --> 04:17:29,100
I made that other part though.

5018
04:17:29,260 --> 04:17:29,680
Seriously.

5019
04:17:32,540 --> 04:17:33,540
There we go.

5020
04:17:33,800 --> 04:17:33,880
Okay.

5021
04:17:34,100 --> 04:17:35,660
Uh... duck.

5022
04:17:36,320 --> 04:17:36,980
Not duck.

5023
04:17:37,860 --> 04:17:38,300
Bat.

5024
04:17:40,300 --> 04:17:40,740
To...

5025
04:17:40,740 --> 04:17:42,840
Oh my gosh.

5026
04:17:42,880 --> 04:17:43,480
That was so close.

5027
04:17:56,110 --> 04:17:56,550
Quack.

5028
04:17:57,530 --> 04:17:58,510
What is this area?

5029
04:18:00,110 --> 04:18:00,990
30th zone?

5030
04:18:02,190 --> 04:18:03,750
I don't know where I'm supposed to be at.

5031
04:18:04,770 --> 04:18:05,210
Wait.

5032
04:18:05,230 --> 04:18:05,430
Hold on.

5033
04:18:06,230 --> 04:18:07,410
Let's check if this is correct.

5034
04:18:08,590 --> 04:18:09,630
It's not correct.

5035
04:18:12,190 --> 04:18:12,730
Wait.

5036
04:18:12,810 --> 04:18:13,870
Then I can't go back.

5037
04:18:16,560 --> 04:18:17,100
Okay.

5038
04:18:17,160 --> 04:18:17,840
Well now we know.

5039
04:18:18,160 --> 04:18:19,800
Because otherwise we wouldn't have known.

5040
04:18:19,980 --> 04:18:20,320
Right?

5041
04:18:20,900 --> 04:18:21,440
Right.

5042
04:18:22,460 --> 04:18:23,960
Learning is half the battle.

5043
04:18:24,240 --> 04:18:25,640
We wouldn't have known otherwise.

5044
04:18:26,040 --> 04:18:26,680
Oh my gosh.

5045
04:18:26,860 --> 04:18:27,620
Leave me alone.

5046
04:18:30,460 --> 04:18:31,000
Hello.

5047
04:18:36,550 --> 04:18:37,090
Hello.

5048
04:18:39,070 --> 04:18:40,410
Let's explore a little bit.

5049
04:18:40,650 --> 04:18:41,950
Have I been here before?

5050
04:18:46,360 --> 04:18:47,640
Have I been here before?

5051
04:18:47,720 --> 04:18:48,140
Oh my gosh.

5052
04:18:48,240 --> 04:18:49,060
Look at all this...

5053
04:18:49,060 --> 04:18:51,580
Look at all this Atlantis imagery.

5054
04:18:53,060 --> 04:18:53,540
Including...

5055
04:18:54,220 --> 04:18:55,600
Very tall bust.

5056
04:18:56,740 --> 04:18:57,220
And...

5057
04:18:58,560 --> 04:18:59,040
Grave.

5058
04:19:01,080 --> 04:19:01,560
Yeah.

5059
04:19:01,640 --> 04:19:03,300
I'm glad all you fuckers died, man.

5060
04:19:05,400 --> 04:19:07,220
Atlantis no butthole more like it.

5061
04:19:07,380 --> 04:19:07,840
God.

5062
04:19:14,320 --> 04:19:15,620
Don't be so rude.

5063
04:19:15,960 --> 04:19:16,520
Don't be so rude.

5064
04:19:18,760 --> 04:19:19,280
Hahaha.

5065
04:19:19,400 --> 04:19:19,800
Hahaha.

5066
04:19:22,020 --> 04:19:23,140
Is that a fountain?

5067
04:19:23,300 --> 04:19:23,460
Oh.

5068
04:19:23,520 --> 04:19:23,920
It might be.

5069
04:19:24,040 --> 04:19:24,480
Actually.

5070
04:19:25,900 --> 04:19:26,940
Spicy mint.

5071
04:19:28,980 --> 04:19:29,500
Sorry.

5072
04:19:29,600 --> 04:19:31,120
I'm a little spicy right now.

5073
04:19:45,900 --> 04:19:46,580
It's okay.

5074
04:19:46,760 --> 04:19:47,060
Okay.

5075
04:19:49,520 --> 04:19:51,480
When we go over there.

5076
04:19:51,560 --> 04:19:52,960
Do not go through that door.

5077
04:19:53,200 --> 04:19:55,500
Because you won't be able to get out.

5078
04:19:56,600 --> 04:19:57,120
So.

5079
04:19:57,120 --> 04:19:58,720
We discovered another thing.

5080
04:19:58,720 --> 04:19:59,800
We discovered another thing.

5081
04:20:02,100 --> 04:20:03,340
Rage meter update when?

5082
04:20:03,540 --> 04:20:04,800
I'm actually not raging at all.

5083
04:20:08,480 --> 04:20:09,920
I'm actually pretty okay.

5084
04:20:10,720 --> 04:20:11,280
Hahaha.

5085
04:20:12,140 --> 04:20:14,080
I thought I would be raging way more.

5086
04:20:14,860 --> 04:20:15,940
But I'm actually alright.

5087
04:20:16,320 --> 04:20:16,900
I think we...

5088
04:20:17,900 --> 04:20:18,460
Okay.

5089
04:20:18,460 --> 04:20:19,020
Nevermind.

5090
04:20:24,490 --> 04:20:25,050
Hahaha.

5091
04:20:27,570 --> 04:20:29,990
These damn crows.

5092
04:20:31,150 --> 04:20:31,830
Vultures.

5093
04:20:31,870 --> 04:20:32,670
Whatever they are.

5094
04:20:38,800 --> 04:20:39,480
Poop.

5095
04:20:43,080 --> 04:20:43,760
Poop.

5096
04:20:43,760 --> 04:20:44,140
Poop.

5097
04:20:44,140 --> 04:20:44,800
Poop.

5098
04:20:44,800 --> 04:20:44,980
Poop.

5099
04:20:45,860 --> 04:20:48,080
What annoys me the most is we...

5100
04:20:48,080 --> 04:20:51,700
There's no in between to get more points.

5101
04:20:51,720 --> 04:20:52,180
You know.

5102
04:20:53,740 --> 04:20:55,800
Between now and...

5103
04:20:58,840 --> 04:21:00,360
Getting to level 10.

5104
04:21:00,480 --> 04:21:01,620
So it's just...

5105
04:21:01,620 --> 04:21:03,380
Pure skill baby.

5106
04:21:05,260 --> 04:21:06,120
Pure skill.

5107
04:21:06,800 --> 04:21:07,400
Pure skill.

5108
04:21:07,400 --> 04:21:08,380
I mean...

5109
04:21:10,200 --> 04:21:11,660
We did level 8.

5110
04:21:12,000 --> 04:21:12,900
One try.

5111
04:21:14,020 --> 04:21:15,440
I don't think we will again.

5112
04:21:15,860 --> 04:21:16,260
Hahaha.

5113
04:21:17,180 --> 04:21:17,780
And...

5114
04:21:20,900 --> 04:21:21,500
And...

5115
04:21:23,580 --> 04:21:24,780
Level 10.

5116
04:21:24,960 --> 04:21:26,440
In like 3 tries.

5117
04:21:27,080 --> 04:21:28,040
Actually I don't remember.

5118
04:21:28,180 --> 04:21:28,600
It might have been 4.

5119
04:21:28,760 --> 04:21:29,160
Who cares.

5120
04:21:30,020 --> 04:21:31,240
Atlantis no unko.

5121
04:21:31,460 --> 04:21:32,080
So true.

5122
04:21:35,280 --> 04:21:36,320
Unchi everywhere.

5123
04:21:38,340 --> 04:21:39,780
FISH INCOMING!

5124
04:21:42,920 --> 04:21:43,640
F...

5125
04:21:43,640 --> 04:21:44,580
F...

5126
04:21:45,160 --> 04:21:46,960
FISH INCOMING!

5127
04:21:50,640 --> 04:21:51,940
Let this guy die.

5128
04:21:52,080 --> 04:21:53,100
FISH INCOMING!

5129
04:21:56,480 --> 04:21:57,920
FISH INCOMING!

5130
04:21:59,440 --> 04:22:01,140
You were a little late there buddy.

5131
04:22:02,280 --> 04:22:03,020
I almost was proven...

5132
04:22:03,020 --> 04:22:04,220
I almost looked like a liar.

5133
04:22:06,260 --> 04:22:07,180
Atlantis no unko!

5134
04:22:09,120 --> 04:22:09,880
Oh I was like...

5135
04:22:09,880 --> 04:22:10,360
What is this one?

5136
04:22:10,800 --> 04:22:11,260
Oh my god.

5137
04:22:14,360 --> 04:22:15,440
Ba da da ba.

5138
04:22:17,040 --> 04:22:18,060
We game through there.

5139
04:22:18,300 --> 04:22:19,240
We game through that.

5140
04:22:20,260 --> 04:22:21,540
Okay here we go everybody.

5141
04:22:24,040 --> 04:22:25,700
I don't know why I deployed that.

5142
04:22:25,800 --> 04:22:26,260
But it's fine.

5143
04:22:27,060 --> 04:22:28,760
Just for safe measure.

5144
04:22:31,180 --> 04:22:32,880
How I lived?

5145
04:22:32,980 --> 04:22:33,620
I don't know.

5146
04:22:33,740 --> 04:22:35,300
But I lived Birch.

5147
04:22:53,220 --> 04:22:54,500
Wait for you to go.

5148
04:22:55,360 --> 04:22:56,060
Okay.

5149
04:22:58,940 --> 04:22:59,640
No!

5150
04:22:59,640 --> 04:23:00,320
No!

5151
04:23:00,360 --> 04:23:01,060
Hoi!

5152
04:23:01,420 --> 04:23:02,120
Hoi!

5153
04:23:03,960 --> 04:23:04,660
Hoi!

5154
04:23:05,900 --> 04:23:06,600
Hoi!

5155
04:23:08,720 --> 04:23:09,420
No!

5156
04:23:27,900 --> 04:23:29,260
I didn't...

5157
04:23:29,260 --> 04:23:31,300
That was just me not getting enough...

5158
04:23:32,760 --> 04:23:34,780
of a head start.

5159
04:23:36,840 --> 04:23:38,540
How many lives do I have left?

5160
04:23:39,660 --> 04:23:40,340
Five?

5161
04:23:43,020 --> 04:23:43,760
Actually not sure.

5162
04:23:55,820 --> 04:23:56,500
Okay.

5163
04:24:00,060 --> 04:24:01,420
Oh shoot.

5164
04:24:01,640 --> 04:24:01,960
Okay.

5165
04:24:08,010 --> 04:24:09,730
Oh my god.

5166
04:24:10,010 --> 04:24:11,150
Oh my god.

5167
04:24:11,790 --> 04:24:13,650
I didn't know if I was gonna make that.

5168
04:24:14,470 --> 04:24:15,270
I...

5169
04:24:15,790 --> 04:24:16,830
Please.

5170
04:24:17,670 --> 04:24:19,310
I need you to make jump...

5171
04:24:19,310 --> 04:24:21,050
longer strides serve.

5172
04:24:22,530 --> 04:24:24,970
I know your legs can handle it.

5173
04:24:50,880 --> 04:24:52,900
Any crab percent.

5174
04:24:56,400 --> 04:24:58,200
Any crab percent.

5175
04:24:59,300 --> 04:25:00,100
Remember

5176
04:25:03,870 --> 04:25:04,910
happy day.

5177
04:25:06,490 --> 04:25:08,870
I'm already wasted a few seconds man.

5178
04:25:09,650 --> 04:25:11,090
I mean I say seconds.

5179
04:25:11,110 --> 04:25:12,330
A few...

5180
04:25:12,910 --> 04:25:13,250
numbers.

5181
04:25:13,730 --> 04:25:16,250
I don't even know how fast it's going.

5182
04:25:20,310 --> 04:25:22,230
I knew I was gonna run into that guy.

5183
04:25:22,410 --> 04:25:22,810
I knew it.

5184
04:25:37,890 --> 04:25:38,370
Safe.

5185
04:25:41,730 --> 04:25:43,410
So glad you can throw things in the air.

5186
04:25:44,450 --> 04:25:46,650
I'm so glad you can throw things in the air.

5187
04:25:46,650 --> 04:25:47,630
Throw bombs in the air.

5188
04:25:47,790 --> 04:25:49,770
Or else I would have been...

5189
04:25:49,770 --> 04:25:50,750
done-zo.

5190
04:25:52,430 --> 04:25:53,330
Done-zo.

5191
04:25:57,110 --> 04:25:58,170
There's two of them.

5192
04:26:05,460 --> 04:26:05,980
Please.

5193
04:26:07,720 --> 04:26:08,820
Tell me 200.

5194
04:26:11,000 --> 04:26:11,720
Oh my god.

5195
04:26:11,760 --> 04:26:11,940
Please.

5196
04:26:12,100 --> 04:26:12,580
Please sir.

5197
04:26:13,340 --> 04:26:14,060
Please sir.

5198
04:26:14,180 --> 04:26:14,540
Please.

5199
04:26:14,660 --> 04:26:15,180
Please.

5200
04:26:15,280 --> 04:26:15,600
Please.

5201
04:26:17,800 --> 04:26:18,320
Please.

5202
04:26:18,600 --> 04:26:19,120
Please.

5203
04:26:19,120 --> 04:26:19,380
Please.

5204
04:26:19,380 --> 04:26:19,580
Please.

5205
04:26:19,580 --> 04:26:19,660
Please.

5206
04:26:19,660 --> 04:26:19,820
Please.

5207
04:26:20,500 --> 04:26:21,020
Okay.

5208
04:26:22,620 --> 04:26:23,660
Four lives.

5209
04:26:23,920 --> 04:26:24,860
In the tenth zone.

5210
04:26:28,100 --> 04:26:29,100
It might...

5211
04:26:29,100 --> 04:26:32,120
Might not be enough but...

5212
04:26:34,620 --> 04:26:35,680
We shall see.

5213
04:26:47,380 --> 04:26:49,980
This game is making me so out of breath.

5214
04:26:57,020 --> 04:26:57,580
Nice.

5215
04:26:57,780 --> 04:26:58,020
Nice.

5216
04:26:59,340 --> 04:27:00,440
Don't jinx it though.

5217
04:27:00,920 --> 04:27:01,480
Don't jinx it though.

5218
04:27:11,550 --> 04:27:12,610
Let's go.

5219
04:27:14,570 --> 04:27:15,410
Let's go.

5220
04:27:15,410 --> 04:27:15,430
Let's go.

5221
04:27:19,510 --> 04:27:21,370
Any crap percentages.

5222
04:27:22,470 --> 04:27:23,950
Yes, Krabby.

5223
04:27:28,070 --> 04:27:30,750
Now I just need to not mess it up here.

5224
04:27:31,290 --> 04:27:32,010
Now I just need to not mess it up here.

5225
04:27:33,030 --> 04:27:33,870
Okay.

5226
04:27:42,320 --> 04:27:43,400
Nice-u.

5227
04:27:49,130 --> 04:27:50,350
Nice-u.

5228
04:27:56,920 --> 04:27:57,360
Okay.

5229
04:27:57,360 --> 04:27:57,800
Okay!

5230
04:27:58,200 --> 04:27:58,900
25th zone!

5231
04:28:00,880 --> 04:28:01,440
Let's go!

5232
04:28:01,700 --> 04:28:01,980
Okay.

5233
04:28:05,500 --> 04:28:07,240
Now we know it's not that door.

5234
04:28:16,570 --> 04:28:17,590
What does this do?

5235
04:28:17,710 --> 04:28:18,470
What does this give me?

5236
04:28:20,790 --> 04:28:21,990
I can't get it.

5237
04:28:23,050 --> 04:28:24,190
Don't go through that, though.

5238
04:28:24,230 --> 04:28:24,970
Don't go through that.

5239
04:28:25,730 --> 04:28:26,910
So much poop.

5240
04:28:27,110 --> 04:28:27,730
I know, right?

5241
04:28:28,770 --> 04:28:29,730
Oh, shoot.

5242
04:28:29,930 --> 04:28:30,150
Okay.

5243
04:28:30,230 --> 04:28:33,470
I'm going to have to start blowing stuff up, I suppose.

5244
04:28:36,070 --> 04:28:37,050
Hoping for the best.

5245
04:28:37,870 --> 04:28:38,350
But...

5246
04:28:41,670 --> 04:28:42,990
Looks like a clock.

5247
04:28:43,150 --> 04:28:44,350
Does it slow down the time?

5248
04:28:44,650 --> 04:28:46,970
Because if so, I really need that right now.

5249
04:28:47,630 --> 04:28:48,830
I really need...

5250
04:28:53,750 --> 04:28:55,890
I wonder if I should just...

5251
04:29:05,030 --> 04:29:05,510
Okay.

5252
04:29:09,810 --> 04:29:10,370
Here?

5253
04:29:10,910 --> 04:29:11,470
Maybe...

5254
04:29:12,070 --> 04:29:13,610
Because this is where...

5255
04:29:17,930 --> 04:29:18,490
No...

5256
04:29:19,630 --> 04:29:20,730
Do I go up?

5257
04:29:22,790 --> 04:29:23,350
No...

5258
04:29:25,110 --> 04:29:28,330
I think if I collect that clock, I go straight into that door.

5259
04:29:33,850 --> 04:29:34,410
Okay.

5260
04:29:35,070 --> 04:29:35,590
Okay.

5261
04:29:42,920 --> 04:29:45,560
The clock slows down the timer to actual seconds.

5262
04:29:45,820 --> 04:29:46,820
Oh, that's so nice!

5263
04:29:47,040 --> 04:29:47,980
I won it!

5264
04:29:48,140 --> 04:29:49,080
I won it!

5265
04:29:50,480 --> 04:29:51,520
Come on!

5266
04:29:53,500 --> 04:29:54,020
Please!

5267
04:29:56,890 --> 04:29:59,550
Unless it's like a... I have to blow up myself somewhere.

5268
04:30:00,050 --> 04:30:02,030
I'm afraid to blow up myself right here.

5269
04:30:02,590 --> 04:30:03,770
Blow up the right chest.

5270
04:30:04,970 --> 04:30:05,490
No...

5271
04:30:07,690 --> 04:30:08,170
Nothing.

5272
04:30:13,330 --> 04:30:16,270
I think I just already did that spot, but I don't think I did here.

5273
04:30:16,810 --> 04:30:17,810
Next to the chest.

5274
04:30:20,010 --> 04:30:20,490
Okay.

5275
04:30:20,550 --> 04:30:22,330
Let's go back through.

5276
04:30:33,460 --> 04:30:33,940
Okay.

5277
04:30:33,940 --> 04:30:36,080
I thought that killed me for a second.

5278
04:30:36,820 --> 04:30:37,300
Whoo!

5279
04:30:38,040 --> 04:30:38,520
Okay.

5280
04:30:38,520 --> 04:30:38,640
Okay.

5281
04:30:42,840 --> 04:30:43,740
Oh my god!

5282
04:30:44,240 --> 04:30:45,920
I was just... I was just like...

5283
04:30:46,330 --> 04:30:46,940
What the hell?

5284
04:30:47,200 --> 04:30:47,700
Okay.

5285
04:30:48,120 --> 04:30:48,620
Yippee!

5286
04:30:49,040 --> 04:30:50,040
41st zone!

5287
04:30:52,180 --> 04:30:52,680
Oh!

5288
04:30:55,580 --> 04:30:56,120
Oh, wait.

5289
04:30:57,720 --> 04:30:58,220
Uh...

5290
04:30:58,220 --> 04:31:00,740
Is this another... blow it up?

5291
04:31:01,260 --> 04:31:01,760
Wait...

5292
04:31:01,760 --> 04:31:02,440
Uh...

5293
04:31:02,440 --> 04:31:03,600
Uh-huh.

5294
04:31:03,780 --> 04:31:04,280
Uh-huh.

5295
04:31:04,380 --> 04:31:04,780
Uh-huh.

5296
04:31:04,860 --> 04:31:05,080
Uh-huh.

5297
04:31:11,260 --> 04:31:12,100
Uh-huh.

5298
04:31:12,160 --> 04:31:14,000
Uh-huh.

5299
04:31:14,000 --> 04:31:14,480
Let's open up that door.

5300
04:31:18,200 --> 04:31:18,600
Hmm...

5301
04:31:19,360 --> 04:31:19,760
Um...

5302
04:31:26,680 --> 04:31:27,080
Uh...

5303
04:31:28,320 --> 04:31:31,360
Trying to create Green Rave when...

5304
04:31:33,060 --> 04:31:34,180
Maybe if I bounce...

5305
04:31:34,180 --> 04:31:34,600
Oh, dang it.

5306
04:31:34,700 --> 04:31:36,580
I was gonna say if I bounce it...

5307
04:31:37,980 --> 04:31:38,800
How the hell?

5308
04:31:39,240 --> 04:31:39,880
Maybe I...

5309
04:31:39,880 --> 04:31:40,600
There we go.

5310
04:31:40,660 --> 04:31:40,920
There we go.

5311
04:31:41,300 --> 04:31:42,060
There we go.

5312
04:31:42,120 --> 04:31:42,540
There we go.

5313
04:31:45,080 --> 04:31:45,740
94th zone!

5314
04:31:45,740 --> 04:31:46,040
Oh my god!

5315
04:31:49,060 --> 04:31:49,860
Oh no!

5316
04:31:49,980 --> 04:31:50,980
It's Brown Rave!

5317
04:31:57,080 --> 04:31:58,040
Oh god!

5318
04:31:58,120 --> 04:31:59,460
It's Brown Rave everybody!

5319
04:32:03,900 --> 04:32:04,380
Okay.

5320
04:32:04,500 --> 04:32:10,400
I thought this was the ice area and I was nervous for a second cause I thought that it would be slippery but it's not at all actually.

5321
04:32:12,720 --> 04:32:13,720
Oh my goodness.

5322
04:32:13,920 --> 04:32:15,680
It's Brown Rave!

5323
04:32:16,760 --> 04:32:17,240
Wait.

5324
04:32:17,320 --> 04:32:18,220
Where do I go from here?

5325
04:32:18,620 --> 04:32:19,180
Uh-oh.

5326
04:32:19,280 --> 04:32:19,940
Wait a second.

5327
04:32:23,080 --> 04:32:23,700
Wait a second.

5328
04:32:23,780 --> 04:32:24,120
Wait a second.

5329
04:32:24,200 --> 04:32:24,440
Wait a second.

5330
04:32:24,480 --> 04:32:25,260
Did I go the wrong way?

5331
04:32:26,640 --> 04:32:26,980
Uh...

5332
04:32:26,980 --> 04:32:27,360
Shoot.

5333
04:32:28,500 --> 04:32:29,020
Hold on.

5334
04:32:32,180 --> 04:32:32,520
No.

5335
04:32:32,540 --> 04:32:33,440
There's nothing that way either.

5336
04:32:35,500 --> 04:32:35,840
Wait.

5337
04:32:35,860 --> 04:32:36,000
Huh?

5338
04:32:37,100 --> 04:32:37,440
Okay.

5339
04:32:37,500 --> 04:32:37,780
Hold on.

5340
04:32:40,800 --> 04:32:41,140
Oh.

5341
04:32:41,560 --> 04:32:43,020
Maybe next to this chest.

5342
04:32:45,360 --> 04:32:45,700
Oh.

5343
04:32:46,020 --> 04:32:46,360
Uh...

5344
04:32:51,500 --> 04:32:51,740
Okay.

5345
04:32:51,820 --> 04:32:52,260
I guess not.

5346
04:32:54,100 --> 04:32:54,460
Uh...

5347
04:32:55,640 --> 04:32:56,000
Uh...

5348
04:32:56,620 --> 04:32:57,320
Oh my god.

5349
04:32:57,380 --> 04:32:57,580
Please.

5350
04:32:57,720 --> 04:33:02,020
Actually, someone just tell me the answer so that I can get out of here because this is so awful!

5351
04:33:02,960 --> 04:33:03,500
Oh wait!

5352
04:33:03,740 --> 04:33:04,440
I think...

5353
04:33:04,440 --> 04:33:04,660
Wait.

5354
04:33:04,860 --> 04:33:07,180
I think I remember this one from the Game Center episode.

5355
04:33:07,400 --> 04:33:07,780
Oh no.

5356
04:33:07,880 --> 04:33:09,300
You guys, we might be here for a while.

5357
04:33:09,560 --> 04:33:10,460
Oh no.

5358
04:33:10,600 --> 04:33:10,960
No.

5359
04:33:11,280 --> 04:33:11,640
No.

5360
04:33:11,820 --> 04:33:12,180
No.

5361
04:33:12,820 --> 04:33:13,180
Ah!

5362
04:33:13,280 --> 04:33:13,840
Last time!

5363
04:33:15,840 --> 04:33:16,560
Oh shoot.

5364
04:33:16,740 --> 04:33:17,700
I didn't notice the time.

5365
04:33:18,340 --> 04:33:19,280
The rightmost ledge.

5366
04:33:19,380 --> 04:33:19,640
Yes.

5367
04:33:19,680 --> 04:33:20,180
I remember.

5368
04:33:20,180 --> 04:33:21,100
I remember now.

5369
04:33:21,400 --> 04:33:22,340
Oh no.

5370
04:33:23,120 --> 04:33:23,530
No.

5371
04:33:30,690 --> 04:33:31,510
No.

5372
04:33:31,950 --> 04:33:32,510
No.

5373
04:33:34,070 --> 04:33:37,290
I thought only if I fell I lost the star!

5374
04:33:39,190 --> 04:33:40,570
Oh my god.

5375
04:33:41,070 --> 04:33:41,270
Oh.

5376
04:33:45,520 --> 04:33:46,340
Oh.

5377
04:33:46,840 --> 04:33:47,040
Oh.

5378
04:33:47,040 --> 04:33:47,840
Oh.

5379
04:33:48,980 --> 04:33:49,800
Oh.

5380
04:33:50,420 --> 04:33:50,740
Oh.

5381
04:33:50,740 --> 04:33:50,820
Oh.

5382
04:33:54,420 --> 04:33:55,240
Oh.

5383
04:33:56,040 --> 04:33:56,860
Oh.

5384
04:34:02,930 --> 04:34:03,710
God.

5385
04:34:03,870 --> 04:34:07,110
And then we have to watch this terrible flashing.

5386
04:34:09,510 --> 04:34:10,470
Oh gosh.

5387
04:34:11,450 --> 04:34:11,930
Oh.

5388
04:34:11,970 --> 04:34:12,490
Why is it...

5389
04:34:12,490 --> 04:34:14,010
Why is there like a motion blur there?

5390
04:34:14,110 --> 04:34:14,710
Are you guys seeing that?

5391
04:34:18,240 --> 04:34:18,860
What the...

5392
04:34:18,860 --> 04:34:19,580
What is going on?

5393
04:34:20,000 --> 04:34:21,040
What's going on there?

5394
04:34:22,160 --> 04:34:22,640
Dang.

5395
04:34:24,120 --> 04:34:25,460
Oh, that's so frustrating.

5396
04:34:28,240 --> 04:34:28,720
Okay.

5397
04:34:30,040 --> 04:34:31,520
I know it's on that ledge.

5398
04:34:31,700 --> 04:34:34,320
I have to like jump down, place the bomb...

5399
04:34:34,320 --> 04:34:34,380
Oh.

5400
04:34:34,380 --> 04:34:35,240
Jump.

5401
04:34:35,380 --> 04:34:37,000
Kind of like how I was doing it before.

5402
04:34:37,800 --> 04:34:39,180
I know how to do it.

5403
04:34:39,240 --> 04:34:39,940
I know how to do it.

5404
04:34:41,520 --> 04:34:42,720
Actually, I'm curious though.

5405
04:34:42,800 --> 04:34:43,580
One second.

5406
04:34:46,140 --> 04:34:47,100
After 94...

5407
04:34:47,100 --> 04:34:48,280
97 and then 100.

5408
04:34:48,440 --> 04:34:49,040
You guys!

5409
04:34:49,440 --> 04:34:52,360
It's just two more after 94.

5410
04:34:52,780 --> 04:34:54,020
It's just two more.

5411
04:34:54,080 --> 04:34:57,260
And 100 will be super easy because we'll have the invincibility.

5412
04:34:57,580 --> 04:34:58,720
Like we've...

5413
04:34:58,720 --> 04:34:59,820
We've got this.

5414
04:35:00,180 --> 04:35:01,140
We got this.

5415
04:35:01,480 --> 04:35:01,960
Okay.

5416
04:35:03,860 --> 04:35:04,360
We're stuck.

5417
04:35:04,380 --> 04:35:04,520
We're stuck.

5418
04:35:04,520 --> 04:35:04,860
We're so close.

5419
04:35:04,940 --> 04:35:06,100
We're so close actually.

5420
04:35:06,440 --> 04:35:06,880
Okay.

5421
04:35:12,340 --> 04:35:12,780
Okay.

5422
04:35:16,620 --> 04:35:24,940
If I can make it there without losing any lives in a stupid way, then we might be able to do it.

5423
04:35:30,330 --> 04:35:34,230
100 is the victory lap if we can get there exactly because we'll have the invincibility.

5424
04:35:40,720 --> 04:35:42,420
But we've made such good progress.

5425
04:35:42,920 --> 04:35:43,660
Proud of us.

5426
04:35:44,440 --> 04:35:45,180
Proud of us.

5427
04:35:45,520 --> 04:35:45,960
Oh.

5428
04:35:47,980 --> 04:35:50,840
Why has the timer got to be so cruel though?

5429
04:35:51,540 --> 04:35:54,580
The flow of time is so cruel.

5430
04:35:54,660 --> 04:35:55,640
It's a cruel mistress.

5431
04:36:04,580 --> 04:36:06,640
Trust in your instincts as a soldier.

5432
04:36:06,920 --> 04:36:08,040
As a gamer.

5433
04:36:08,880 --> 04:36:09,780
Yes, master!

5434
04:36:13,580 --> 04:36:14,720
Master Pallet!

5435
04:36:15,980 --> 04:36:17,020
Fish incoming!

5436
04:36:18,760 --> 04:36:20,480
Why are you a backwards fish?

5437
04:36:23,020 --> 04:36:23,780
Fish incoming!

5438
04:36:26,780 --> 04:36:27,440
Oh my gosh.

5439
04:36:27,460 --> 04:36:28,040
That was so close.

5440
04:36:29,240 --> 04:36:29,840
Sheesh.

5441
04:36:32,200 --> 04:36:34,340
Let these guys fall off the edge.

5442
04:36:36,320 --> 04:36:37,380
Fish incoming!

5443
04:36:43,490 --> 04:36:44,090
Fish...

5444
04:36:44,090 --> 04:36:45,270
Fish incoming!

5445
04:36:46,750 --> 04:36:47,350
Okay.

5446
04:36:48,070 --> 04:36:49,090
Sixth zone.

5447
04:36:53,940 --> 04:36:54,540
Oh.

5448
04:36:54,560 --> 04:36:55,300
I missed it.

5449
04:36:55,420 --> 04:36:56,120
Oh my god.

5450
04:36:56,160 --> 04:36:57,420
Oh my god.

5451
04:36:57,420 --> 04:36:57,560
Oh my god.

5452
04:36:57,980 --> 04:36:58,940
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

5453
04:36:59,100 --> 04:36:59,360
Whew.

5454
04:37:00,800 --> 04:37:02,240
Oh that was so close.

5455
04:37:02,640 --> 04:37:03,960
That was so close.

5456
04:37:04,140 --> 04:37:04,620
Alright, here we go.

5457
04:37:06,900 --> 04:37:07,260
Gaming...

5458
04:37:07,860 --> 04:37:08,220
Gaming...

5459
04:37:08,220 --> 04:37:12,100
Oh I'm not

5460
04:37:16,160 --> 04:37:59,440
gonna make it.

5461
04:38:00,480 --> 04:38:01,500
Oh I'm not gonna make it.

5462
04:38:01,860 --> 04:38:03,000
I'm not gonna make it.

5463
04:38:03,860 --> 04:38:05,380
I'm not gonna make it, you guys.

5464
04:38:06,260 --> 04:38:07,760
I'm not gonna make it, you guys.

5465
04:38:07,900 --> 04:38:09,080
I'm not gonna make it.

5466
04:38:10,080 --> 04:38:11,360
I'm not gonna make it.

5467
04:38:16,840 --> 04:38:17,680
I made

5468
04:38:25,290 --> 04:38:31,210
it!

5469
04:38:53,880 --> 04:38:55,280
I made it!

5470
04:38:55,280 --> 04:38:55,800
Yippee!

5471
04:38:55,800 --> 04:38:59,920
I made

5472
04:39:14,730 --> 04:39:15,310
it!

5473
04:39:17,470 --> 04:39:18,170
Yippee!

5474
04:39:22,790 --> 04:39:24,190
Yippee!

5475
04:39:30,970 --> 04:39:31,630
Oh my god!

5476
04:39:32,450 --> 04:39:33,570
Oh god!

5477
04:39:38,950 --> 04:39:41,050
Okay, okay.

5478
04:39:41,910 --> 04:39:42,710
Fourth zone.

5479
04:39:44,970 --> 04:39:46,850
Don't mess it up, Minto.

5480
04:39:54,600 --> 04:39:56,640
I don't know why I waited for that guy to pass.

5481
04:39:57,540 --> 04:39:59,700
I was just being courteous to him, I guess.

5482
04:40:03,430 --> 04:40:03,910
Okay.

5483
04:40:04,830 --> 04:40:05,310
Okay.

5484
04:40:06,050 --> 04:40:09,570
I'm gonna try and get through the poop rave as quickly as I possibly can.

5485
04:40:09,590 --> 04:40:10,190
You guys.

5486
04:40:14,530 --> 04:40:15,950
I wish I could grab this.

5487
04:40:16,090 --> 04:40:17,130
I really wish I could.

5488
04:40:19,030 --> 04:40:20,210
Oh my god!

5489
04:40:20,350 --> 04:40:21,050
Oh my god!

5490
04:40:24,800 --> 04:40:25,780
Okay, poop rave.

5491
04:40:27,840 --> 04:40:29,400
Shield your eyes, please.

5492
04:40:29,880 --> 04:40:30,800
Shield your eyes.

5493
04:40:31,080 --> 04:40:31,580
Oh, sorry.

5494
04:40:31,740 --> 04:40:34,000
Actually, I thought the poop rave was right now.

5495
04:40:36,040 --> 04:40:36,700
My bad.

5496
04:40:38,940 --> 04:40:39,400
Okay.

5497
04:40:39,400 --> 04:40:40,200
Poop rave!

5498
04:40:47,940 --> 04:40:51,280
Everything jumping at once is really a lot.

5499
04:40:53,160 --> 04:40:55,720
It's a little overwhelming.

5500
04:40:55,920 --> 04:40:56,400
Okay.

5501
04:40:56,940 --> 04:40:57,420
Alright.

5502
04:41:32,420 --> 04:41:34,060
We were doing so well.

5503
04:41:53,080 --> 04:41:53,660
It's okay.

5504
04:41:54,140 --> 04:41:55,740
You saw how quickly we got here.

5505
04:41:56,600 --> 04:41:58,120
We got back here so quickly.

5506
04:41:58,220 --> 04:41:59,760
I just want to get out of this damn room.

5507
04:42:00,960 --> 04:42:02,580
It's so awful.

5508
04:42:02,900 --> 04:42:05,260
It's so awful in my eyes.

5509
04:42:10,380 --> 04:42:11,300
Okay.

5510
04:42:11,300 --> 04:42:12,220
Okay.

5511
04:42:12,400 --> 04:42:14,200
We got there quickly, though.

5512
04:42:21,020 --> 04:42:22,360
Update the rage meter.

5513
04:42:26,020 --> 04:42:28,900
Poop rave percent.

5514
04:42:34,580 --> 04:42:36,200
The green was so much worse, though.

5515
04:42:36,240 --> 04:42:36,900
It actually was.

5516
04:42:36,920 --> 04:42:37,480
You are right.

5517
04:42:37,640 --> 04:42:38,620
It was way worse.

5518
04:42:40,160 --> 04:42:41,260
I was actually concerned.

5519
04:42:41,620 --> 04:42:42,600
I was like, oh my gosh.

5520
04:42:42,900 --> 04:42:44,640
And I hope... I really hope that...

5521
04:42:44,640 --> 04:42:46,340
Because I had no idea it was a thing.

5522
04:42:46,400 --> 04:42:49,880
I really hope that, like, I didn't cause anyone harm.

5523
04:42:50,100 --> 04:42:52,240
Like, if they were epileptic or something.

5524
04:42:52,360 --> 04:42:52,940
Oh my god.

5525
04:42:53,140 --> 04:42:54,520
I was actually legitimately...

5526
04:42:55,780 --> 04:42:56,180
worried.

5527
04:43:01,350 --> 04:43:02,890
Back from watching Shin Godzilla.

5528
04:43:03,230 --> 04:43:03,790
Nam was right.

5529
04:43:03,830 --> 04:43:04,170
It was good.

5530
04:43:04,670 --> 04:43:05,890
Have you still not won?

5531
04:43:05,930 --> 04:43:06,730
Shut up, JB!

5532
04:43:07,070 --> 04:43:08,270
Shut the hell up!

5533
04:43:08,490 --> 04:43:09,230
Shut up!

5534
04:43:11,690 --> 04:43:13,130
Have you still not won?

5535
04:43:37,040 --> 04:43:38,200
Are you winning, Minto?

5536
04:43:38,900 --> 04:43:40,020
We're really close.

5537
04:43:40,360 --> 04:43:40,980
I'll be honest.

5538
04:43:41,100 --> 04:43:42,680
We're actually so close, you guys.

5539
04:43:42,720 --> 04:43:43,840
We're actually so close.

5540
04:43:44,220 --> 04:43:46,720
We're actually so close!

5541
04:43:48,020 --> 04:43:50,280
I just timed the bomb wrong.

5542
04:43:51,560 --> 04:43:53,860
I've timed the bomb wrong.

5543
04:43:59,420 --> 04:44:04,040
I actually was really concerned.

5544
04:44:04,200 --> 04:44:05,880
I was like, maybe I shouldn't play this game today.

5545
04:44:05,980 --> 04:44:06,360
Because...

5546
04:44:06,360 --> 04:44:08,600
Exactly the reaction I wanted.

5547
04:44:10,140 --> 04:44:14,000
I was like, I wonder if I'm going to get legitimately, like, mad.

5548
04:44:14,180 --> 04:44:14,720
Because...

5549
04:44:15,640 --> 04:44:19,120
I'm a little sensitive this week.

5550
04:44:19,380 --> 04:44:20,940
So I was just like, uh-oh.

5551
04:44:21,120 --> 04:44:23,980
What if I actually, actually start to rage?

5552
04:44:24,860 --> 04:44:26,680
It's not fun for people watching.

5553
04:44:27,260 --> 04:44:27,760
But...

5554
04:44:28,960 --> 04:44:29,700
I'm okay!

5555
04:44:34,540 --> 04:44:36,220
You timed the jump wrong.

5556
04:44:36,360 --> 04:44:37,420
That's what I said!

5557
04:44:45,160 --> 04:44:46,240
It's ghost week.

5558
04:44:49,980 --> 04:44:50,940
The time of the...

5559
04:44:50,940 --> 04:44:51,920
Of...

5560
04:44:51,920 --> 04:44:56,180
It's time of every month where a ghost is more rageful.

5561
04:45:14,900 --> 04:45:15,540
Okay!

5562
04:45:17,680 --> 04:45:19,240
Alright, Poltergeist week!

5563
04:45:20,180 --> 04:45:21,460
FISH INCOMING!

5564
04:45:22,720 --> 04:45:27,600
Oh my gosh.

5565
04:45:27,680 --> 04:45:30,220
The things that I have to do to keep myself sane.

5566
04:45:33,260 --> 04:45:34,140
FISH INCOMING!

5567
04:45:37,340 --> 04:45:37,780
Okay.

5568
04:45:39,200 --> 04:45:39,800
Sixth zone!

5569
04:45:45,150 --> 04:45:45,590
Oh!

5570
04:45:45,750 --> 04:45:46,570
Oh my god!

5571
04:45:46,950 --> 04:45:47,770
Oh my god!

5572
04:45:47,890 --> 04:45:48,290
What the?

5573
04:46:02,240 --> 04:46:03,260
What was that?

5574
04:46:03,280 --> 04:46:04,640
A secret door that I unlocked!

5575
04:46:04,900 --> 04:46:05,680
Did you guys see that?

5576
04:46:06,300 --> 04:46:07,500
There was another door!

5577
04:46:08,840 --> 04:46:10,280
I wonder where that went to.

5578
04:46:11,280 --> 04:46:12,180
Oh my gosh.

5579
04:46:12,280 --> 04:46:12,680
I thought...

5580
04:46:12,680 --> 04:46:14,460
I thought I was gonna run into them.

5581
04:46:14,560 --> 04:46:15,680
That's why I stopped moving.

5582
04:46:15,860 --> 04:46:16,420
Cause I was like...

5583
04:46:16,420 --> 04:46:17,980
Okay, I guess I'll die here.

5584
04:46:19,620 --> 04:46:21,380
I guess it's time for...

5585
04:46:21,380 --> 04:46:21,680
To...

5586
04:46:21,680 --> 04:46:22,340
DIE!

5587
04:46:26,200 --> 04:46:27,200
That was...

5588
04:46:27,200 --> 04:46:28,020
Clutch.

5589
04:46:36,460 --> 04:46:37,460
I'm like...

5590
04:46:37,460 --> 04:46:41,220
Gripping my controller so hard right now!

5591
04:46:41,240 --> 04:46:42,180
It's kind of insane.

5592
04:46:44,540 --> 04:46:45,040
I'm like...

5593
04:46:45,040 --> 04:46:45,980
I'm like...

5594
04:46:45,980 --> 04:46:46,240
I'm like...

5595
04:46:46,240 --> 04:46:47,060
Hey hey hey...

5596
04:46:47,060 --> 04:46:48,140
Heh heh heh heh...

5597
04:46:48,140 --> 04:46:48,880
Hoy.

5598
04:46:49,560 --> 04:46:50,080
Hoy.

5599
04:46:53,960 --> 04:46:54,480
Hoy!

5600
04:46:55,320 --> 04:46:55,840
Hoy.

5601
04:46:56,220 --> 04:46:56,620
Hoy.

5602
04:46:56,620 --> 04:46:57,020
Hoy.

5603
04:46:57,760 --> 04:46:58,280
Hoy.

5604
04:47:00,220 --> 04:47:00,340
Nyiii!

5605
04:47:00,620 --> 04:47:01,140
Nice.

5606
04:47:02,680 --> 04:47:03,720
Nice sssooooooo...

5607
04:47:05,120 --> 04:47:05,640
Oh!

5608
04:47:05,700 --> 04:47:06,200
Oh!

5609
04:47:06,260 --> 04:47:06,780
My gosh.

5610
04:47:07,020 --> 04:47:07,380
Heheh!

5611
04:47:07,640 --> 04:47:11,620
I wonder if I should start grabbing that chest if I have extra time.

5612
04:47:11,720 --> 04:47:13,820
If it will be enough for me to like get...

5613
04:47:13,820 --> 04:47:15,260
Oh mah goood!

5614
04:47:15,560 --> 04:47:16,900
An extra life!

5615
04:47:17,500 --> 04:47:17,740
Uhh...

5616
04:47:44,700 --> 04:47:47,140
I was going to say something, but I'm not going to jinx this level.

5617
04:47:47,660 --> 04:47:48,680
I'm not going to jinx it.

5618
04:47:49,200 --> 04:47:50,300
I'm not going to jinx it.

5619
04:47:54,550 --> 04:47:55,650
I'm just not going to say anything.

5620
04:47:56,530 --> 04:47:57,750
I'm just not going to say anything.

5621
04:48:04,100 --> 04:48:07,600
I was going to say I'm so glad I've gotten better at this level.

5622
04:48:11,080 --> 04:48:12,200
Oh, man.

5623
04:48:34,840 --> 04:48:35,660
I'm throwing!

5624
04:48:36,000 --> 04:48:36,460
I'm throwing!

5625
04:48:36,740 --> 04:48:37,260
I'm throwing!

5626
04:48:59,900 --> 04:49:00,300
No.

5627
04:49:01,200 --> 04:49:03,280
I don't even know how many lives I have left.

5628
04:49:15,220 --> 04:49:17,080
I don't even know how many lives I have left.

5629
04:49:18,540 --> 04:49:19,480
I don't even know.

5630
04:49:23,270 --> 04:49:24,450
I don't even know.

5631
04:49:26,570 --> 04:49:27,330
Not that many.

5632
04:49:27,490 --> 04:49:30,550
Not as many as I had at the beginning of the stage.

5633
04:49:31,090 --> 04:49:32,050
Why did I do that?

5634
04:49:34,070 --> 04:49:34,470
One!

5635
04:49:53,360 --> 04:49:54,200
I'm not mad.

5636
04:49:54,280 --> 04:49:55,300
I'm mostly just sad.

5637
04:49:56,800 --> 04:49:58,580
I'm mostly just sad.

5638
04:50:00,500 --> 04:50:01,340
Okay.

5639
04:50:03,020 --> 04:50:03,900
It's okay.

5640
04:50:08,340 --> 04:50:09,620
It's okay.

5641
04:50:19,170 --> 04:50:20,010
Two!

5642
04:50:22,070 --> 04:50:25,930
Forgive me while I'm worried about your voice, the shrill screams you were making.

5643
04:50:26,770 --> 04:50:28,610
You're too adorable.

5644
04:50:31,790 --> 04:50:34,350
Why is me screaming adorable?

5645
04:50:36,550 --> 04:50:37,310
That was close.

5646
04:50:38,010 --> 04:50:39,730
That was too close for comfort.

5647
04:50:39,790 --> 04:50:41,170
I'm going to try and get the treasure down here.

5648
04:50:42,650 --> 04:50:44,610
I think I have enough time to get it.

5649
04:51:02,050 --> 04:51:03,810
I think I have enough time to get it.

5650
04:51:04,610 --> 04:51:05,290
There we go.

5651
04:51:07,870 --> 04:51:10,150
I love the sound of people suffering.

5652
04:51:11,050 --> 04:51:11,850
FISH INCOMING!

5653
04:51:16,370 --> 04:51:17,170
FISH INCOMING!

5654
04:51:17,530 --> 04:51:18,570
Oh, that was early.

5655
04:51:25,160 --> 04:51:25,840
FISH!

5656
04:51:26,360 --> 04:51:27,780
FISH INCOMING!

5657
04:51:31,580 --> 04:51:32,260
Please.

5658
04:51:39,300 --> 04:51:39,980
Okay.

5659
04:51:40,080 --> 04:51:40,860
There we go.

5660
04:51:43,020 --> 04:51:44,000
Eighth zone.

5661
04:51:44,480 --> 04:51:45,160
Let's go!

5662
04:51:51,250 --> 04:51:53,290
Wow, there's no guys over here today.

5663
04:51:54,130 --> 04:51:56,170
They're all crammed up there instead.

5664
04:52:00,490 --> 04:52:01,150
And then there.

5665
04:52:05,110 --> 04:52:05,810
Hoi-ya.

5666
04:52:06,850 --> 04:52:07,730
Hoi-ya.

5667
04:52:16,540 --> 04:52:18,380
Sorry I get so quiet at this level.

5668
04:52:18,440 --> 04:52:19,480
I'm really concentrating.

5669
04:52:51,980 --> 04:52:53,220
It's only 13?

5670
04:52:55,680 --> 04:52:56,400
Messed up.

5671
04:53:01,030 --> 04:53:02,850
I thought I died real quick.

5672
04:53:03,050 --> 04:53:04,010
Oh my gosh.

5673
04:53:06,950 --> 04:53:07,490
Okay.

5674
04:53:08,370 --> 04:53:08,930
Okay!

5675
04:53:08,930 --> 04:53:09,330
Okay!

5676
04:53:44,470 --> 04:53:46,830
I don't know why I'm getting the timing on this.

5677
04:53:47,050 --> 04:53:49,330
Or I'm not getting the timing on this, rather.

5678
04:53:49,570 --> 04:53:52,550
Like I'm getting it... I'm doing so poorly with the timing.

5679
04:53:54,890 --> 04:53:57,990
This game is really playing mind games on me!

5680
04:53:59,690 --> 04:54:05,530
It's really... It's really playing mind games on me!

5681
04:54:11,690 --> 04:54:14,170
Oh, guys!

5682
04:54:16,730 --> 04:54:17,430
Why?

5683
04:54:20,290 --> 04:54:20,990
Thank

5684
04:54:38,200 --> 04:54:38,940
goodness!

5685
04:54:56,100 --> 04:54:57,500
Okay.

5686
04:55:06,760 --> 04:55:07,820
What do we have?

5687
04:55:07,940 --> 04:55:08,360
Five lives?

5688
04:55:09,780 --> 04:55:10,480
Four?

5689
04:55:10,540 --> 04:55:10,840
Four?

5690
04:55:11,740 --> 04:55:14,640
Oh, shucks!

5691
04:55:18,200 --> 04:55:19,200
Nice number!

5692
04:55:20,100 --> 04:55:21,000
Spooky number!

5693
04:55:22,540 --> 04:55:23,100
Four...

5694
04:55:28,840 --> 04:55:30,040
And the fourth zone!

5695
04:55:31,100 --> 04:55:31,660
Okay.

5696
04:55:31,840 --> 04:55:32,280
Alright.

5697
04:55:49,850 --> 04:55:52,610
I hope you guys are just as invested as I am.

5698
04:55:57,670 --> 04:55:58,230
Okay.

5699
04:55:58,450 --> 04:55:58,730
Alright.

5700
04:55:58,850 --> 04:56:02,130
This one has the clock that I can possibly get.

5701
04:56:08,300 --> 04:56:09,180
What was it?

5702
04:56:09,260 --> 04:56:10,880
I think I went from this side.

5703
04:56:12,720 --> 04:56:13,200
No.

5704
04:56:16,720 --> 04:56:17,200
Nice!

5705
04:56:17,440 --> 04:56:17,780
Okay.

5706
04:56:17,880 --> 04:56:18,200
Alright.

5707
04:56:19,120 --> 04:56:19,600
Alright.

5708
04:56:20,000 --> 04:56:24,540
Even though I know I'm invincible, the poop still... still psychs me out a little bit.

5709
04:56:26,100 --> 04:56:26,580
Okay.

5710
04:56:26,640 --> 04:56:27,800
What is that hitbox?

5711
04:56:28,460 --> 04:56:30,540
Oh, right now we're invincible, so...

5712
04:56:37,690 --> 04:56:38,170
Alright.

5713
04:56:38,270 --> 04:56:39,010
Poop rave time!

5714
04:56:39,010 --> 04:56:39,350
Time!

5715
04:57:00,650 --> 04:57:01,350
Okay.

5716
04:57:05,150 --> 04:57:05,930
Okay.

5717
04:57:10,760 --> 04:57:12,300
Nine lives?!

5718
04:57:17,500 --> 04:57:18,900
Oh!

5719
04:57:21,100 --> 04:57:23,500
Oh my God!

5720
04:57:29,600 --> 04:57:30,500
Oh my god!

5721
04:57:30,500 --> 04:57:30,640
Um...

5722
04:57:30,640 --> 04:57:31,840
You guys?

5723
04:57:33,980 --> 04:57:34,940
I don't...

5724
04:57:38,960 --> 04:57:40,580
If I jump, nothing happens.

5725
04:57:40,800 --> 04:57:41,720
If I jump, nothing happens.

5726
04:57:43,640 --> 04:57:45,080
Okay, time for leap of faith!

5727
04:57:46,900 --> 04:57:48,480
Oh my god!

5728
04:58:10,530 --> 04:58:12,770
Look at me taking all these hits.

5729
04:58:14,010 --> 04:58:14,930
No way.

5730
04:58:14,930 --> 04:58:15,150
No way.

5731
04:58:16,010 --> 04:58:16,750
No way.

5732
04:58:17,590 --> 04:58:19,790
No way, no way, no way, no way!

5733
04:58:24,540 --> 04:58:25,260
What's over here?

5734
04:58:25,960 --> 04:58:26,660
Okay, nothing.

5735
04:58:30,660 --> 04:58:31,100
Congratulations!

5736
04:58:41,560 --> 04:58:42,640
Oh, is that it?

5737
04:58:53,340 --> 04:58:55,940
Oh my god, I can't believe we did the last level!

5738
04:58:56,540 --> 04:58:58,220
First try, no way!

5739
04:58:59,080 --> 04:58:59,520
Congratulations!

5740
04:59:05,560 --> 04:59:07,480
Why is the timer still going?

5741
04:59:07,720 --> 04:59:08,420
Can I leave?

5742
04:59:09,980 --> 04:59:10,640
I can!

5743
04:59:11,100 --> 04:59:11,400
Wait.

5744
04:59:11,740 --> 04:59:13,220
Wait, maybe there's another side.

5745
04:59:13,360 --> 04:59:14,120
Maybe there's the other side.

5746
04:59:15,400 --> 04:59:16,940
Why is the timer still going?

5747
04:59:22,040 --> 04:59:22,520
Congratulations!

5748
04:59:25,560 --> 04:59:27,140
No, there's no door over here.

5749
04:59:28,500 --> 04:59:31,000
Yeah, you can play the whole game again, but backwards!

5750
04:59:33,440 --> 04:59:33,920
Go...

5751
04:59:37,900 --> 04:59:38,920
Is that it?

5752
04:59:39,260 --> 04:59:40,500
You have to go backwards.

5753
04:59:47,810 --> 04:59:48,690
Oh, yeah.

5754
04:59:48,770 --> 04:59:50,530
I'm just in another...

5755
04:59:50,530 --> 04:59:53,390
I'm literally just in another...

5756
04:59:54,370 --> 04:59:55,450
No way.

5757
04:59:58,260 --> 04:59:59,800
Wait, there's actually...

5758
04:59:59,800 --> 05:00:01,660
There's not even an ending screen.

5759
05:00:03,200 --> 05:00:03,840
Congratulations!

5760
05:00:10,020 --> 05:00:11,260
Thank you for the...

5761
05:00:11,260 --> 05:00:13,440
Thank you!

5762
05:00:14,100 --> 05:00:15,520
Oh my god, 51 cards!

5763
05:00:15,620 --> 05:00:16,000
Thank you for the...

5764
05:00:16,000 --> 05:00:16,580
Thank you, super.

5765
05:00:20,730 --> 05:00:21,250
Cheese...

5766
05:00:21,250 --> 05:00:21,850
Hold on.

5767
05:00:27,910 --> 05:00:30,910
I want to

5768
05:00:36,500 --> 05:00:37,600
be a little taller than them.

5769
05:00:38,600 --> 05:00:39,040
Yippee!

5770
05:00:41,780 --> 05:00:44,780
We beat Atlantis no night zone.

5771
05:00:44,920 --> 05:00:47,380
Wait, if the timer runs out, do I get a game over?

5772
05:00:47,540 --> 05:00:47,900
I wonder.

5773
05:00:48,400 --> 05:00:50,740
We beat Atlantis no night zone...

5774
05:00:50,740 --> 05:00:53,580
Oh, in way less time than I expected it to.

5775
05:00:53,920 --> 05:00:54,840
Holy cow!

5776
05:01:00,990 --> 05:01:03,370
Way less time than I expected it to!

5777
05:01:05,830 --> 05:01:07,910
This didn't feel like an endurance at all!

5778
05:01:08,570 --> 05:01:10,950
I god-gamered my way through it!

5779
05:01:14,950 --> 05:01:17,730
Hold on, I can... one second...

5780
05:01:17,730 --> 05:01:18,510
Yippee!

5781
05:01:19,250 --> 05:01:19,890
Congratulations!

5782
05:01:19,890 --> 05:01:20,290
Congratulations!

5783
05:01:21,170 --> 05:01:21,990
Congratulations!

5784
05:01:23,230 --> 05:01:23,550
Congratulations!

5785
05:01:25,650 --> 05:01:27,290
Thank you!

5786
05:01:28,410 --> 05:01:29,230
Congratulations!

5787
05:01:33,590 --> 05:01:35,870
It was the grip!

5788
05:01:36,170 --> 05:01:37,890
Oh my gosh!

5789
05:01:41,030 --> 05:01:41,850
Wow!

5790
05:01:42,310 --> 05:01:44,070
This music is driving me crazy.

5791
05:01:44,070 --> 05:01:46,150
But I'm curious what happens when the timer goes out.

5792
05:01:47,570 --> 05:01:49,110
Congratulations everybody!

5793
05:01:51,350 --> 05:01:53,090
This is it!

5794
05:01:53,210 --> 05:01:53,950
This is it!

5795
05:01:54,030 --> 05:01:54,610
Here it comes!

5796
05:01:55,590 --> 05:01:56,650
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

5797
05:02:09,040 --> 05:02:10,240
No way!

5798
05:02:10,480 --> 05:02:12,860
It takes me back to the screen!

5799
05:02:14,780 --> 05:02:18,100
It just tells me, congratulations again!

5800
05:02:19,560 --> 05:02:20,580
No way!

5801
05:02:21,340 --> 05:02:22,480
No way!

5802
05:02:22,480 --> 05:02:24,220
Sorry, I'm trying to adjust myself.

5803
05:02:24,620 --> 05:02:26,300
Oh my god!

5804
05:02:28,320 --> 05:02:29,400
That is ridiculous.

5805
05:02:29,840 --> 05:02:31,200
Okay, get me out of here please.

5806
05:02:31,620 --> 05:02:33,220
Did it waste a life?

5807
05:02:33,440 --> 05:02:34,900
I don't actually know.

5808
05:02:35,240 --> 05:02:36,800
Did I waste a life doing that?

5809
05:02:41,280 --> 05:02:43,000
How do I get out of here?

5810
05:02:44,720 --> 05:02:45,660
Yeah, I did!

5811
05:02:50,060 --> 05:02:50,540
Yippee!

5812
05:02:50,720 --> 05:02:51,660
Who is this guy?

5813
05:02:51,660 --> 05:02:52,600
Why are you here?

5814
05:02:52,960 --> 05:02:55,060
Why does it look like you are sitting on the toilet?

5815
05:02:56,100 --> 05:02:58,040
What is this guy?

5816
05:02:58,240 --> 05:03:00,620
The mystery of Atlantis?

5817
05:03:01,080 --> 05:03:02,720
Was it the diamond I got?

5818
05:03:04,860 --> 05:03:06,020
Can you exit the room?

5819
05:03:06,100 --> 05:03:06,340
We can.

5820
05:03:06,660 --> 05:03:06,980
We can.

5821
05:03:08,140 --> 05:03:09,060
Oh my goodness.

5822
05:03:09,220 --> 05:03:10,200
He's the nozzle.

5823
05:03:11,440 --> 05:03:12,180
Nozzle, nozzle.

5824
05:03:18,220 --> 05:03:18,860
Nozzle.

5825
05:03:18,860 --> 05:03:20,000
Thank you for the gift.

5826
05:03:20,020 --> 05:03:21,440
Thank you.

5827
05:03:23,240 --> 05:03:23,880
Okay.

5828
05:03:24,820 --> 05:03:26,080
Do I still have...

5829
05:03:26,080 --> 05:03:29,560
Oh, I don't have invincibility anymore because I...

5830
05:03:30,300 --> 05:03:32,940
Because I died on the winning screen.

5831
05:03:34,140 --> 05:03:37,240
Okay, let's just waste all of our lives.

5832
05:03:37,640 --> 05:03:38,720
Wait, there's a door here.

5833
05:03:42,560 --> 05:03:43,640
What's in that door?

5834
05:03:47,810 --> 05:03:50,730
Now nobody can say you aren't a gamer.

5835
05:03:50,850 --> 05:03:51,290
Congratulations!

5836
05:03:52,150 --> 05:03:52,950
Thank you!

5837
05:03:54,670 --> 05:03:56,730
Uh-oh, he's gonna start shooting at me.

5838
05:03:58,230 --> 05:03:58,790
Yup.

5839
05:04:02,300 --> 05:04:03,140
Oh my god.

5840
05:04:03,300 --> 05:04:04,100
This is...

5841
05:04:06,020 --> 05:04:06,860
Oh my god.

5842
05:04:07,160 --> 05:04:08,400
Oh my god.

5843
05:04:09,020 --> 05:04:10,780
Why is this game so hard?

5844
05:04:11,200 --> 05:04:12,880
It's so obtuse rather.

5845
05:04:13,420 --> 05:04:14,440
Oh my god.

5846
05:04:16,540 --> 05:04:19,160
I'm trying to die, but I'm too good at this game.

5847
05:04:19,300 --> 05:04:21,300
Wait, I wanna see where this door went to.

5848
05:04:23,780 --> 05:04:24,500
Oh my god.

5849
05:04:27,200 --> 05:04:29,920
Thirty seconds zone and it's pink.

5850
05:04:31,800 --> 05:04:32,640
What's the S?

5851
05:04:33,240 --> 05:04:34,320
Oh, whoops, my bad.

5852
05:04:35,040 --> 05:04:36,220
We're in like a graveyard.

5853
05:04:39,260 --> 05:04:41,960
I don't know what that just did.

5854
05:04:46,040 --> 05:04:46,520
Scallies!

5855
05:04:47,360 --> 05:04:48,840
Oh my god, I should look at them jump.

5856
05:04:51,740 --> 05:04:52,780
That's so silly.

5857
05:04:53,700 --> 05:04:55,280
Why am I still playing this game?

5858
05:04:55,600 --> 05:04:56,820
What's wrong with me?

5859
05:04:59,020 --> 05:05:01,640
Why am I still playing this game?

5860
05:05:01,860 --> 05:05:02,980
S equals spooky.

5861
05:05:06,220 --> 05:05:06,940
Wait, if I...

5862
05:05:06,940 --> 05:05:08,160
Can I go this way?

5863
05:05:08,300 --> 05:05:09,060
No, I can't.

5864
05:05:10,740 --> 05:05:13,120
Congratulations, you have completed a great game.

5865
05:05:13,120 --> 05:05:15,320
And proved the justice of our culture.

5866
05:05:15,720 --> 05:05:17,480
What are you talking about?

5867
05:05:19,460 --> 05:05:19,940
Oh!

5868
05:05:20,060 --> 05:05:21,220
I didn't even notice him.

5869
05:05:21,900 --> 05:05:22,380
Okay.

5870
05:05:30,490 --> 05:05:32,290
Mint better than Arino Kacho confirmed?

5871
05:05:32,690 --> 05:05:34,670
No, no, no, no, no.

5872
05:05:35,010 --> 05:05:37,230
No, no, no, no, no, no.

5873
05:05:37,730 --> 05:05:39,510
No, no, no, no, no.

5874
05:05:39,950 --> 05:05:40,830
How do I please?

5875
05:05:40,930 --> 05:05:42,670
I just wanna go to the home screen, honestly.

5876
05:05:44,570 --> 05:05:46,850
I really just wanna go to the home screen, please.

5877
05:05:52,320 --> 05:05:53,660
So I feel okay.

5878
05:05:53,860 --> 05:05:55,520
I cannot believe I beat this game.

5879
05:05:56,280 --> 05:05:57,140
Oh my gosh.

5880
05:05:57,300 --> 05:05:58,900
I can't believe I beat this game.

5881
05:05:59,880 --> 05:06:00,720
I always...

5882
05:06:00,720 --> 05:06:02,080
I thought that it would be...

5883
05:06:02,080 --> 05:06:04,020
That I would have...

5884
05:06:04,020 --> 05:06:06,740
Like it would take me like three streams to beat it.

5885
05:06:07,760 --> 05:06:09,460
But no, I beat it.

5886
05:06:09,540 --> 05:06:10,540
Don't ignore that part.

5887
05:06:10,700 --> 05:06:11,180
Ignore...

5888
05:06:11,180 --> 05:06:11,880
Don't look at that.

5889
05:06:11,980 --> 05:06:12,840
Don't look at the game over.

5890
05:06:15,600 --> 05:06:16,080
Congratulations.

5891
05:06:17,680 --> 05:06:18,740
Oh my gosh.

5892
05:06:20,200 --> 05:06:20,680
Okay.

5893
05:06:22,020 --> 05:06:22,980
Give me a second.

5894
05:06:26,800 --> 05:06:27,760
One second.

5895
05:06:27,820 --> 05:06:28,260
One second.

5896
05:06:29,020 --> 05:06:30,980
I gotta make us...

5897
05:06:32,640 --> 05:06:34,160
I gotta put everything up.

5898
05:06:34,240 --> 05:06:34,620
Hold on.

5899
05:06:34,780 --> 05:06:35,720
One second, you guys.

5900
05:06:36,380 --> 05:06:37,200
One second.

5901
05:06:37,260 --> 05:06:38,880
I gotta get the chat all ready.

5902
05:06:39,660 --> 05:06:40,380
Hold on.

5903
05:06:41,180 --> 05:06:41,660
Oh.

5904
05:06:42,600 --> 05:06:43,080
Wait.

5905
05:06:43,240 --> 05:06:43,760
No, no, no.

5906
05:06:43,880 --> 05:06:44,980
I'm ruining everything.

5907
05:06:45,160 --> 05:06:45,900
Pop out chat.

5908
05:06:46,020 --> 05:06:46,560
There we go.

5909
05:06:47,540 --> 05:06:48,800
Gotta get everything ready.

5910
05:06:50,100 --> 05:06:50,920
Here we go.

5911
05:06:54,320 --> 05:06:55,280
Oh, no.

5912
05:06:55,380 --> 05:06:56,100
You can still hear it.

5913
05:06:57,840 --> 05:06:58,460
Oh, no.

5914
05:06:58,840 --> 05:06:59,320
Stop.

5915
05:07:07,870 --> 05:07:08,350
Wow.

5916
05:07:09,190 --> 05:07:09,930
One second.

5917
05:07:10,010 --> 05:07:11,070
Let me also...

5918
05:07:12,590 --> 05:07:13,510
My computer.

5919
05:07:14,490 --> 05:07:15,490
There we go.

5920
05:07:24,310 --> 05:07:27,290
I thought I was gonna be with you guys all day.

5921
05:07:27,350 --> 05:07:27,550
Oh, no.

5922
05:07:27,550 --> 05:07:29,510
I mean, I kinda was.

5923
05:07:30,510 --> 05:07:31,250
But, wow.

5924
05:07:33,370 --> 05:07:33,890
Congratulations.

5925
05:07:34,170 --> 05:07:34,990
Thank you.

5926
05:07:36,470 --> 05:07:37,750
The game is over.

5927
05:07:39,810 --> 05:07:40,930
Oh, my goodness.

5928
05:07:45,090 --> 05:07:46,130
Oh, my goodness.

5929
05:07:47,670 --> 05:07:53,250
I remember watching Korone beating this live and it is an honor and a privilege to see you doing it as well.

5930
05:07:53,330 --> 05:07:53,710
Congratulations.

5931
05:07:53,750 --> 05:07:54,750
God gave her Minto.

5932
05:07:55,270 --> 05:07:58,990
I actually kind of want to try the way she does it.

5933
05:07:58,990 --> 05:08:00,750
She did it because you guys said it was more difficult.

5934
05:08:02,770 --> 05:08:07,250
Kind of curious how much more difficult it is.

5935
05:08:07,370 --> 05:08:10,510
I mean, once you get the invincibility, it's just like a walk in the park.

5936
05:08:10,750 --> 05:08:11,130
But...

5937
05:08:14,090 --> 05:08:22,470
And I think I probably would have been stuck on the poop rave more if I hadn't remembered where the door was.

5938
05:08:22,610 --> 05:08:22,850
Not...

5939
05:08:22,850 --> 05:08:23,370
Actually, no.

5940
05:08:23,450 --> 05:08:23,990
I don't think.

5941
05:08:24,010 --> 05:08:26,170
I know I would have been stuck on the poop...

5942
05:08:26,830 --> 05:08:28,610
The poop rave more.

5943
05:08:28,610 --> 05:08:34,050
If I hadn't known where the door was.

5944
05:08:34,330 --> 05:08:34,630
So...

5945
05:08:37,710 --> 05:08:39,430
That leap of faith was clutch.

5946
05:08:39,590 --> 05:08:40,550
I can't believe...

5947
05:08:40,550 --> 05:08:44,390
I cannot believe that I did that last level in one shot.

5948
05:08:44,630 --> 05:08:45,150
In one...

5949
05:08:45,150 --> 05:08:45,950
I cannot believe.

5950
05:08:48,250 --> 05:08:49,990
Without invincibility, it takes forever?

5951
05:08:50,310 --> 05:08:51,150
Yeah, I can imagine.

5952
05:08:53,050 --> 05:08:54,050
But I'm curious.

5953
05:08:55,090 --> 05:08:57,590
Korone-san did the actual gamer way.

5954
05:08:57,730 --> 05:08:58,590
The actual gamer way.

5955
05:08:58,610 --> 05:08:59,490
The actual god gamer way.

5956
05:08:59,630 --> 05:09:01,250
Maybe I took the easy way.

5957
05:09:02,410 --> 05:09:03,010
But...

5958
05:09:05,490 --> 05:09:06,090
Ohowowow.

5959
05:09:07,630 --> 05:09:09,090
It was still...

5960
05:09:09,090 --> 05:09:10,370
It was still a time.

5961
05:09:11,310 --> 05:09:12,670
It was still...

5962
05:09:12,670 --> 05:09:13,830
A time.

5963
05:09:16,910 --> 05:09:18,110
Oh, wow.

5964
05:09:18,270 --> 05:09:18,950
He's so loud.

5965
05:09:19,050 --> 05:09:19,450
Oh my goodness.

5966
05:09:19,550 --> 05:09:19,790
Sorry.

5967
05:09:21,250 --> 05:09:22,170
Goodness gracious.

5968
05:09:24,070 --> 05:09:24,670
Chuuu!

5969
05:09:24,670 --> 05:09:25,190
Thank you!

5970
05:09:26,690 --> 05:09:28,510
I guess the real Atlantis isn't Azuma.

5971
05:09:28,510 --> 05:09:30,970
This was the Vtuber we gaslit along the way.

5972
05:09:33,490 --> 05:09:35,510
It was hard either way, Minto.

5973
05:09:36,290 --> 05:09:36,770
Maybe.

5974
05:09:37,610 --> 05:09:38,410
Corrin, thanks!

5975
05:09:50,360 --> 05:09:53,200
Korone had to memorize the precise jump pattern to get through it.

5976
05:09:54,460 --> 05:09:55,400
I want to try.

5977
05:09:56,440 --> 05:09:58,060
Like I said, I like challenges.

5978
05:09:58,500 --> 05:09:59,940
And this was quite a challenge.

5979
05:10:01,420 --> 05:10:02,180
It's like those three numbers.

5980
05:10:03,360 --> 05:10:07,020
It's the order of statues you need to bomb to get the door that warps to the end.

5981
05:10:07,480 --> 05:10:08,720
So it is Nagoya.

5982
05:10:08,880 --> 05:10:09,860
7, 3, 8.

5983
05:10:11,520 --> 05:10:12,200
I bet.

5984
05:10:12,380 --> 05:10:13,660
Or I'm assuming.

5985
05:10:15,140 --> 05:10:17,620
Was there even a single mermaid in this game?

5986
05:10:17,900 --> 05:10:19,120
There was the fish people!

5987
05:10:19,300 --> 05:10:19,500
Yeah!

5988
05:10:21,260 --> 05:10:22,720
There were the fish people!

5989
05:10:23,340 --> 05:10:24,420
The fish people!

5990
05:10:28,920 --> 05:10:31,220
11 hours Sisyphus endurance win.

5991
05:10:31,420 --> 05:10:35,820
I don't know.

5992
05:10:35,880 --> 05:10:40,880
I prefer older Rage games to newer Rage games.

5993
05:10:41,020 --> 05:10:41,980
Because I feel like...

5994
05:10:41,980 --> 05:10:47,240
I mean, not to say that older games don't make them obtuse on purpose.

5995
05:10:49,740 --> 05:10:50,860
They are.

5996
05:10:51,200 --> 05:10:54,060
And they're still... you know.

5997
05:10:55,040 --> 05:10:56,020
Angel, thank you!

5998
05:10:56,420 --> 05:10:58,240
Still, thanks for the chill stream.

5999
05:11:00,760 --> 05:11:01,820
But I don't know.

6000
05:11:02,720 --> 05:11:05,300
Games that are made to be Rage games are different.

6001
05:11:05,580 --> 05:11:06,600
Yeah, I think so too.

6002
05:11:07,280 --> 05:11:07,740
Right?

6003
05:11:07,960 --> 05:11:09,580
Have you played Echo the Dolphin yet?

6004
05:11:09,680 --> 05:11:10,260
Oh my god!

6005
05:11:10,460 --> 05:11:12,260
I played that when I was a kid!

6006
05:11:12,680 --> 05:11:14,360
And it scarred me!

6007
05:11:15,420 --> 05:11:16,320
That game...

6008
05:11:16,320 --> 05:11:18,220
My sister had a...

6009
05:11:18,780 --> 05:11:19,240
A...

6010
05:11:21,180 --> 05:11:22,720
The Sega Genesis.

6011
05:11:23,740 --> 05:11:24,380
Actually, sorry.

6012
05:11:24,480 --> 05:11:25,460
It was the Sega Nomad.

6013
05:11:25,480 --> 05:11:27,340
Because the Genesis one is the console...

6014
05:11:27,340 --> 05:11:27,720
Or the...

6015
05:11:27,720 --> 05:11:29,560
Like the home version.

6016
05:11:29,700 --> 05:11:29,900
Right?

6017
05:11:29,920 --> 05:11:31,280
And the Nomad is the handheld.

6018
05:11:31,460 --> 05:11:32,300
We had the Nomad.

6019
05:11:33,620 --> 05:11:34,100
And...

6020
05:11:34,680 --> 05:11:35,640
We had...

6021
05:11:35,640 --> 05:11:38,280
We had the Jurassic Park game.

6022
05:11:39,180 --> 05:11:40,320
Sonic 1 and 2.

6023
05:11:42,000 --> 05:11:43,460
The Lion King game.

6024
05:11:43,580 --> 05:11:43,900
Which...

6025
05:11:44,640 --> 05:11:47,280
Maybe I should try the Lion King game.

6026
05:11:47,780 --> 05:11:48,620
That is...

6027
05:11:48,620 --> 05:11:49,100
Oh!

6028
05:11:49,700 --> 05:11:50,180
Actually...

6029
05:11:50,180 --> 05:11:50,720
Oh my gosh!

6030
05:11:50,960 --> 05:11:53,060
I think I can still play it.

6031
05:11:53,100 --> 05:11:54,300
I think there's still a way to play it.

6032
05:11:54,380 --> 05:11:56,760
I never got to play the Winnie the Pooh game.

6033
05:11:56,760 --> 05:11:58,300
Oh my gosh!

6034
05:11:59,480 --> 05:12:00,480
Takashi's castle.

6035
05:12:02,880 --> 05:12:03,560
Maybe.

6036
05:12:04,960 --> 05:12:05,640
Maybe.

6037
05:12:12,300 --> 05:12:14,100
The Lion King game is hard.

6038
05:12:14,240 --> 05:12:15,680
It's so hard!

6039
05:12:16,340 --> 05:12:18,000
Maybe I should play the Lion King game.

6040
05:12:18,120 --> 05:12:19,900
And the Winnie the Pooh baseball game.

6041
05:12:20,580 --> 05:12:21,260
And...

6042
05:12:21,740 --> 05:12:22,880
Yeah, but we had that.

6043
05:12:22,940 --> 05:12:23,540
Lion King.

6044
05:12:24,400 --> 05:12:25,440
Jurassic Park.

6045
05:12:26,340 --> 05:12:27,300
We had...

6046
05:12:27,300 --> 05:12:30,140
A box with the Tasmanian Devil game.

6047
05:12:30,280 --> 05:12:30,460
Which...

6048
05:12:30,460 --> 05:12:31,040
But...

6049
05:12:32,900 --> 05:12:34,720
The game was not in there luckily.

6050
05:12:36,320 --> 05:12:36,800
And...

6051
05:12:36,800 --> 05:12:37,920
We had Echo the Dolphin.

6052
05:12:38,000 --> 05:12:39,540
I don't think there was anything else that we had.

6053
05:12:40,920 --> 05:12:42,640
But I played a lot of Sonic.

6054
05:12:42,800 --> 05:12:44,140
And I played a lot of...

6055
05:12:45,840 --> 05:12:46,680
Lion King.

6056
05:12:47,840 --> 05:12:50,440
Actually, I played my good share of...

6057
05:12:51,380 --> 05:12:51,860
Of...

6058
05:12:53,020 --> 05:12:54,540
Of Echo and...

6059
05:12:55,440 --> 05:12:56,400
Jurassic Park 2.

6060
05:12:56,520 --> 05:12:57,540
And Jacob's thanks for the 10 gifted!

6061
05:12:57,860 --> 05:12:59,840
The M in Minto stands for Masochist.

6062
05:13:00,960 --> 05:13:03,800
Lion King Game Gear is some deep cussom.

6063
05:13:07,860 --> 05:13:10,440
Yeah, maybe we'll have to play some more...

6064
05:13:11,160 --> 05:13:12,320
Games like that.

6065
05:13:13,660 --> 05:13:14,200
The...

6066
05:13:14,200 --> 05:13:16,500
The true...

6067
05:13:16,500 --> 05:13:18,100
The true...

6068
05:13:20,860 --> 05:13:21,720
Challenge games.

6069
05:13:21,860 --> 05:13:24,540
Sorry, my brain is melted right now.

6070
05:13:25,440 --> 05:13:28,300
My brain is so jelly right now.

6071
05:13:28,320 --> 05:13:29,340
Oh my gosh.

6072
05:13:32,800 --> 05:13:36,780
I feel like all the adrenaline just kind of crashed.

6073
05:13:40,700 --> 05:13:41,960
I did it!

6074
05:13:42,240 --> 05:13:42,540
Yippee!

6075
05:13:42,920 --> 05:13:44,160
Oh my gosh, Brick!

6076
05:13:44,180 --> 05:13:45,380
Thank you for the 15 gifted!

6077
05:13:45,460 --> 05:13:46,080
Thank you!

6078
05:13:47,420 --> 05:13:48,720
Thank you so much!

6079
05:13:49,020 --> 05:13:50,100
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

6080
05:13:51,260 --> 05:13:52,600
Grats on 200k by the way.

6081
05:13:52,640 --> 05:13:53,420
Thank you so much!

6082
05:13:53,540 --> 05:13:54,180
Thank you!

6083
05:14:05,340 --> 05:14:06,360
It's not that easy...

6084
05:14:07,940 --> 05:14:08,360
It's about time we've moved on.

6085
05:14:08,420 --> 05:14:08,820
Well, I'm gonna do what I like to do.

6086
05:14:08,820 --> 05:14:13,400
But, really, It's actually pretty hard for me to like, This is the only one I've ever played the fer main game ever.

6087
05:14:15,800 --> 05:14:19,260
But in this world is so hard for me because of my jed HUD just lost in puples.

6088
05:14:19,340 --> 05:14:21,280
IL troubler was standing up there and she must be one of his most featured options Uh...

6089
05:14:22,980 --> 05:14:23,380
Tada.

6090
05:14:23,380 --> 05:14:29,600
I'm like opening and closing them like okay all right let's stretch stretch them out.

6091
05:14:32,400 --> 05:14:34,260
Wait a second.

6092
05:14:40,910 --> 05:14:44,350
I'm okay.

6093
05:14:44,510 --> 05:14:45,270
Everything's good.

6094
05:14:45,470 --> 05:14:46,470
It's just text.

6095
05:14:46,570 --> 05:14:47,930
Checking a text.

6096
05:14:49,210 --> 05:14:52,390
I'm meeting my... I'm seeing my mom tomorrow.

6097
05:14:53,070 --> 05:15:02,070
But I will be doing a patreon game tomorrow.

6098
05:15:03,490 --> 05:15:05,030
You don't have to leave just yet.

6099
05:15:05,370 --> 05:15:05,810
Minecraft?

6100
05:15:07,230 --> 05:15:13,550
I'm trying to... I'm still trying to find time to organize a collab so I can get a tour of the Vshojo Minecraft server.

6101
05:15:13,730 --> 05:15:15,970
But I'm still really scared of joining it.

6102
05:15:16,010 --> 05:15:18,110
It looks so intense with that many mods they have.

6103
05:15:21,510 --> 05:15:22,370
Tell your mom we're going to play Minecraft tomorrow.

6104
05:15:22,370 --> 05:15:22,670
We said hi.

6105
05:15:22,910 --> 05:15:23,370
I will.

6106
05:15:24,390 --> 05:15:25,290
I will.

6107
05:15:27,250 --> 05:15:33,570
Tomorrow is Mother's Day for I think a lot of people so.

6108
05:15:35,170 --> 05:15:36,550
Wildestuck thanks for the Tony gift.

6109
05:15:37,990 --> 05:15:39,050
Thank you.

6110
05:15:40,410 --> 05:15:43,170
You learn base Minecraft from nothing you'll learn mods too.

6111
05:15:43,610 --> 05:15:44,130
Okay.

6112
05:15:44,690 --> 05:15:45,210
Okay.

6113
05:15:45,510 --> 05:15:49,350
I'm also nervous because there's like a lot of people on the server that I don't know.

6114
05:15:49,510 --> 05:15:51,130
So I'm like, shy.

6115
05:15:55,210 --> 05:15:56,290
But yeah.

6116
05:16:00,050 --> 05:16:01,390
I've seen their server mods.

6117
05:16:01,530 --> 05:16:02,170
It's so cool.

6118
05:16:02,470 --> 05:16:03,010
Hmm.

6119
05:16:06,550 --> 05:16:07,530
I have to.

6120
05:16:07,550 --> 05:16:08,730
I've seen a little bit of it.

6121
05:16:08,810 --> 05:16:12,490
But I think it's mostly like the crazy.

6122
05:16:12,510 --> 05:16:18,490
I already I already feel like I don't utilize the crafting to its potential and regular Minecraft.

6123
05:16:18,490 --> 05:16:23,570
So I'm like, oh gosh, when it's modded, I'm going to be like...

6124
05:16:24,690 --> 05:16:25,570
Dirt house.

6125
05:16:28,030 --> 05:16:28,990
Dirt house.

6126
05:16:31,790 --> 05:16:32,750
Scary time.

6127
05:16:33,170 --> 05:16:33,890
Thank you!

6128
05:16:33,990 --> 05:16:34,950
Thanks for one month!

6129
05:16:36,550 --> 05:16:41,490
But yeah, next week will be a bit of a shorter week, actually.

6130
05:16:43,890 --> 05:16:50,110
But I have a collab with my beloved Ayami-sensei!

6131
05:16:50,470 --> 05:16:51,670
Let me check the date.

6132
05:16:51,750 --> 05:16:52,650
I believe it's on Tuesday.

6133
05:16:53,670 --> 05:16:56,690
I will be streaming on Monday because it is a short week.

6134
05:16:57,530 --> 05:16:59,370
I'll be streaming Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

6135
05:16:59,650 --> 05:17:00,990
And then I'll be off for a couple days.

6136
05:17:02,090 --> 05:17:03,930
Until the following Monday.

6137
05:17:04,710 --> 05:17:08,650
But I have a Tuesday collab with Ayami-sensei!

6138
05:17:10,470 --> 05:17:11,010
So...

6139
05:17:11,490 --> 05:17:11,750
Yeah!

6140
05:17:12,010 --> 05:17:13,550
Yeah, I'm so excited!

6141
05:17:15,910 --> 05:17:20,090
If you don't know Ayami-sensei, definitely go check out her Twitter.

6142
05:17:20,470 --> 05:17:22,230
Oh, wait, I can get that.

6143
05:17:22,530 --> 05:17:23,970
I can link that to you.

6144
05:17:28,770 --> 05:17:31,770
Oh, be careful, it's a little...

6145
05:17:33,030 --> 05:17:34,330
It's a little...

6146
05:17:36,530 --> 05:17:37,550
Maybe sexy.

6147
05:17:40,290 --> 05:17:42,170
But she was...

6148
05:17:42,170 --> 05:17:46,050
She's Meru-san's mama from Hololive.

6149
05:17:46,710 --> 05:17:47,310
So...

6150
05:17:47,310 --> 05:17:50,810
Yeah, and her art is so sexy and cute.

6151
05:17:54,330 --> 05:17:55,330
What's the collab?

6152
05:17:55,710 --> 05:17:56,970
You'll just have to see.

6153
05:17:57,790 --> 05:18:00,370
It's actually not really a game.

6154
05:18:01,070 --> 05:18:01,670
So...

6155
05:18:02,350 --> 05:18:05,050
I was mad when my Fallout 1 got corrupted.

6156
05:18:05,210 --> 05:18:06,150
Oh, I'm sorry!

6157
05:18:06,150 --> 05:18:06,570
Sorry!

6158
05:18:06,590 --> 05:18:08,610
I know, that would really frustrate me too.

6159
05:18:08,850 --> 05:18:10,190
My birthday's on Monday!

6160
05:18:10,310 --> 05:18:11,030
Can I get a happy birthday?

6161
05:18:11,650 --> 05:18:12,450
Toyroxy!

6162
05:18:12,690 --> 05:18:13,910
Happy birthday!

6163
05:18:14,970 --> 05:18:17,010
Happy birthday to you!

6164
05:18:17,810 --> 05:18:19,890
Happy birthday to you!

6165
05:18:20,330 --> 05:18:23,170
Happy birthday, Toyroxy!

6166
05:18:25,090 --> 05:18:28,630
Happy birthday to you!

6167
05:18:31,690 --> 05:18:34,070
But I'll be streaming on your birthday.

6168
05:18:37,780 --> 05:18:38,740
One Monday.

6169
05:18:39,380 --> 05:18:40,380
Monday, Monday, Monday.

6170
05:18:40,980 --> 05:18:43,680
Yeah, so I'm sorry that next week will be a little bit...

6171
05:18:45,520 --> 05:18:47,480
A little bit shorter.

6172
05:18:49,000 --> 05:18:49,480
But...

6173
05:18:49,480 --> 05:18:50,400
Yeah.

6174
05:18:52,560 --> 05:18:53,040
Cool.

6175
05:18:53,400 --> 05:18:55,040
I think I'm gonna head out then.

6176
05:18:55,340 --> 05:18:56,320
I think I'm gonna...

6177
05:18:56,880 --> 05:18:58,100
I think I'm just gonna go.

6178
05:19:02,140 --> 05:19:03,080
I'm like...

6179
05:19:05,440 --> 05:19:05,860
Yeah.

6180
05:19:07,040 --> 05:19:07,640
I

6181
05:19:12,170 --> 05:19:13,990
think I'm gonna head out.

6182
05:19:14,310 --> 05:19:15,570
Rest my brain.

6183
05:19:16,050 --> 05:19:18,110
I think I'm gonna go rest my brain.

6184
05:19:18,870 --> 05:19:20,150
And play Bloons.

6185
05:19:21,370 --> 05:19:25,190
I think I'm gonna go play Bloons.

6186
05:19:26,910 --> 05:19:27,510
Yeah.

6187
05:19:28,610 --> 05:19:31,470
Thank you guys for cheering me on.

6188
05:19:31,710 --> 05:19:35,070
I wouldn't have been able to complete it without your help for sure.

6189
05:19:36,550 --> 05:19:37,150
So...

6190
05:19:37,150 --> 05:19:39,570
I really appreciate you guys encouraging me.

6191
05:19:39,570 --> 05:19:40,530

6192
05:19:40,530 --> 05:19:41,430
Also...

6193
05:19:42,550 --> 05:19:44,070
Calling me out when I'm bad.

6194
05:19:44,250 --> 05:19:45,270
And also...

6195
05:19:45,890 --> 05:19:47,410
Helping me with some of the puzzles.

6196
05:19:49,010 --> 05:19:50,050
Thank you guys.

6197
05:19:50,870 --> 05:19:51,750
Little word.

6198
05:19:51,910 --> 05:19:52,770
Welcome back.

6199
05:19:52,790 --> 05:19:53,310

05:19:55,830 --> 05:19:56,490
So yeah.

See you...

6202
05:19:59,390 --> 05:20:01,970
If I see you guys tomorrow for the Patreon games.

6203
05:20:02,090 --> 05:20:03,010
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

6204
05:20:04,370 --> 05:20:05,770
But if not...

6205
05:20:05,770 --> 05:20:06,790
I'll see you Monday.

6206
05:20:07,150 --> 05:20:07,590

6207
05:20:07,590 --> 05:20:08,630
