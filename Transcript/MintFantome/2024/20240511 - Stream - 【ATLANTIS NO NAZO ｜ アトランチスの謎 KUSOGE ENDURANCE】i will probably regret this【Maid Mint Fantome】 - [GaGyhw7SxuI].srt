1
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,440
Oh,

2
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:10,700
I didn't do that.

3
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,280
That's not me.

4
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,180
I am jumping though.

5
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,060
Look at me go.

6
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,520
I don't know.

7
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,180
Why are you stopping?

8
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,120
Welcome everybody to Atlantis No Nazo.

9
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,260
Oh, get that.

10
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,380
He's just, he's acting on his own, honestly.

11
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,040
I'm surprised he's still alive.

12
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,340
Look at him go.

13
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,260
How does the rage meter work?

14
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,780
Go, jump!

15
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,920
It just happens.

16
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,860
We'll raid it, you know?

17
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,360
Right now it's at 0% rage.

18
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:11,280
zero percent rage everybody we're good everything is calm

19
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:26,060
are unaware of this game it is just a notoriously difficult
platformer like old from famicom era games it's atlantis no

20
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:33,780
naso So, um, uh, I don't even know what to say.

21
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,660
Sorry, my brain is so out of sorts today.

22
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,940
Um, one month!

23
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,180
Woohoo!

24
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,420
Thank you guys!

25
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,520
Wait, that'd be one month.

26
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,040
Are these like one months from before I graduated?

27
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,860
Or it's weird saying that.

28
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,600
Or has it been a month since I opened up members?

29
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,780
I can't.

30
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,700
It's been one month since you opened up.

31
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,220
Oh my gosh.

32
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,120
Thank you guys.

33
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,880
Thank you guys, thank you.

34
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,060
Okay, I'm really confused because memberships are showing
up.

35
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:13,940
Okay, hold on.

36
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,700
Let me ask, let me check real quick for Streamlabs.

37
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,460
I checked last night but nothing was weird.

38
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,800
But yeah, so I'm gonna do my best with this game.

39
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,700
There's 99 levels.

40
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,300
There's 99...

41
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,240
Wait, what is this?

42
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,160
Interesting.

43
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,820
There's 99 levels.

44
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,100
So I'm going to try and clear everything.

45
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,220
I'm going to do my best.

46
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,900
Excited for Kamige.

47
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,380
Streamlabs test.

48
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,420
Well, I think there was some gifted, so it might be a
little...

49
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,260
Sorry, my brain is really...

50
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,140
Today.

51
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,920
I'm so sorry.

52
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,000
Why did...

53
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,320
What is going on?

54
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,580
I think...

55
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,040
I think Streamlabs changed.

56
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,380
Eh?

57
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,400
Huh?

58
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,320
Okay, that worked, but...

59
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,680
That worked.

60
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:18,880
Eh?

61
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,370
I'm confused.

62
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,530
Huh?

63
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,670
They changed the whole site.

64
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,370
I don't understand it anymore.

65
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,090
Wait.

66
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,110
Where do I...

67
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,770
Where's my custom ones?

68
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,310
Oh no.

69
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:38,910
Wait.

70
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,850
Oh.

71
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,210
Eh?

72
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:40,830
Eh?

73
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,010
Eh?

74
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,150
Eh?

75
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,790
Oh,

76
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:49,910
tip variation.

77
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,510
Worked!

78
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,450
Yippee!

79
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,470
Okay, it worked.

80
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,950
Okay, sorry guys for that little delay.

81
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:11,850
Some of these things I can't test, unless I'm on stream,
right?

82
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:15,510
So...

83
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,910
The CPU in the demo mode is pretty bad.

84
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,790
Now I'm not gonna look... I'm not gonna be as bad as this
guy at all.

85
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,590
So all you can do...

86
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,390
Here I'll show you guys.

87
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,490
Let's start.

88
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,270
Oh my gosh.

89
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,490
First zone mystery adventure start.

90
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,550
Okay, this is just to show you guys how the game works.

91
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,690
So you can throw bombs.

92
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,610
You have to avoid the poop.

93
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,850
And you can duck.

94
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,810
Oh, and you can jump.

95
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:38,990
And that's it.

96
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,950
When you jump, you can't... Oh my gosh.

97
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,770
You can't move while you're jumping.

98
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,330
It can make things quite difficult.

99
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:47,230
Wait!

100
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,050
Wait!

101
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,770
Watch out for the poop.

102
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,570
But, um...

103
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,730
Maybe I could jump over those guys.

104
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,070
Treasure!

105
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,410
And we're here to discover the mystery of Atlantis.

106
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:04,710
What?

107
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,730
Oh my gosh, I didn't see that guy!

108
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,390
The mystery of Atlantis.

109
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:08,870
Look at...

110
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,930
I'm gonna keep going.

111
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,730
this way.

112
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:15,930
Wait, how do I...

113
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,330
Oh my gosh, don't poop on me.

114
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,310
Up?

115
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:21,830
Up?

116
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:22,270
No.

117
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,250
Hold on.

118
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,870
Maybe bomb it.

119
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,950
Oh, bomb.

120
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,030
Bomb.

121
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:32,730
Okay, and...

122
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,130
Oh, ah!

123
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,070
You have to throw a bomb at the door.

124
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:37,770
Oh, I tried.

125
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,770
Let's try this way.

126
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:41,430
Wait.

127
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,690
No worries, we have seven, five lives.

128
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,170
We have five lives, everybody.

129
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,390
It's all good.

130
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,830
Oh my gosh, that was so close.

131
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:57,910
Oh, yeah!

132
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,110
Okay, we're good.

133
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,010
Everything's fine.

134
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,230
Don't poop on me.

135
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,950
The little, the poops are like such a full shape, like a
whole poop.

136
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,930
Like it couldn't be like a little pellet.

137
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:26,670
No, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay, hey, hey, hey, maybe it,

138
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,410
maybe it needs to get, like, right on top of it.

139
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,690
No worries,

140
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,480
did I open it?

141
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,240
I don't even know.

142
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,940
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

143
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:39,640
Run!

144
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,580
Maybe using the D-Pag would be better.

145
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:55,020
I don't know why I was Okay It did open Okay, nice, nice,

148
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,400
We're fine.

149
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,140
Don't go through there.

150
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,480
Oh, oh, oh.

151
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,780
Why did you stand back up?

152
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,460
Mr. Adventurer.

153
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,960
Press down and drop a bomb at your feet.

154
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,440
So funny thing, I'll show you.

155
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,200
Oh.

156
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,320
Maybe, hold on.

157
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,520
I'll show you.

158
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:05,560
Pretty sure You can die to your own bombs Because it's

00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,680

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,640
Nice.

164
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,180
Okay, nice, nice.

165
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,900
Wait, how did I jump so high before?

166
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:38,620
Hey!

167
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,040

Yeah!

170
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,160
Wait, I can't get through there actually.

171
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,520
I only think about it.

172
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:48,720
Oh.

173
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,400
Uh...

174
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,420
How do you get past here?

175
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,560
Huh?

176
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,150
Open the door for me a little worm!

177
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,270
Oh, there's more worms over here too.

178
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:16,490
Oh,

179
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:23,870
wait!

180
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,230
Oh my gosh, when you jump, you can't move- Okay, move
around.

181
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,910
I made it to the 52nd- 52nd, 54th?

182
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,870
Whichever one that was.

183
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,090
Good job, everybody.

184
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,990
Let's try going through that first door.

185
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,470
Actually, I know that leads to the second one.

186
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,090
I was really curious about the other one, which is- Oh, how
did I live?

187
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:57,730
How did I live?

188
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:58,350
How did I live?

189
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,510
How did I live?

190
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:00,210
How did I live?

191
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,590
How did I live?

192
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:20,850
Yippee!

193
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,770
Where was that door?

194
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,390
I think it really is a pain in the bite that the enemies are
randomized.

195
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:37,110
I stood up too soon.

196
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,430
No way.

197
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,610
I stood up too soon.

198
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,930
Okay, okay, okay.

199
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,370
That's fine.

200
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,250
Okay, second zone.

201
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,170
Ha!

202
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,480
Ha!

203
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:11,860
Ha!

204
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,300
Ha!

205
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:12,740
Ha!

206
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,660
Wait, those go down.

207
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,120
Oh, treasure, treasure.

208
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,000
Nice.

209
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,280
I don't want to be bought, get, got by my own bomb, though.

210
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:26,680
Ha!

211
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:27,700
Ha!

212
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,480
Okay, nice, nice.

213
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,220
Ha!

214
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:30,940
Let's go up.

215
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,580
I don't have no idea where I'm going.

216
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:35,700
Wait!

217
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:39,880
That's okay.

218
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,500
Only 600 seconds.

219
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,300
I know, alright?

220
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,780
Oh, oh, oh.

221
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,700
There we go.

222
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,280
At least it's unlimited bomb.

223
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,800
Oh my god.

224
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,320
Oh, that was close.

225
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,120
Nice.

226
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,120
Yeah, get out of here.

227
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,360
Oh, get out of here.

228
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,200
Run.

229
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,440
Nice.

230
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,160
That was close.

231
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,860
Okay, this guy again.

232
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,300
Oh, nice.

233
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,240
Where's the door?

234
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,280
Oh.

235
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,240
Oh, but there's a treasure down there.

236
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,140
Third zone.

237
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,840
If you run, jump, then immediately jump again, you'll jump
higher.

238
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,160
Oh my god.

239
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,700
Are you sure about that?

240
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,480
Oh my god.

241
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,160
Oh my god, that was so close.

242
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:45,860
Oh my god.

243
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,560
You can't move when you jump.

244
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,880
So it's like, you have to, oh my god.

245
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,380
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

246
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:56,860
Okay.

247
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,320
This dang fish.

248
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:03,600
Okay.

249
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,030
Full commit every jump.

250
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:12,950
It feels like...

251
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,570
Let's try this way.

252
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,770
Oh my god.

253
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,550
Leave me alone!

254
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,170
This guy was targeting me.

255
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,270
It feels like Jump King in that regard.

256
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,910
You know what I mean?

257
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:29,190
Where it's like Jump King, you have to commit To your...

258
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,230
To your jump.

259
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,030
Jump.

260
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,380
Jump.

261
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,480
Oh my god.

262
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,100
Oh, it's a good thing I didn't jump.

263
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Jump.

264
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:52,920
Ah!

265
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,200
Wait.

266
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,480
Six though?

267
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,620
Wait, what?

268
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,540
What just happened?

269
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,120
Wait, how did I get here?

270
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:02,600
Oh my god.

271
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,500
What is that?

272
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:05,880
What is that?

273
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,280
What is that?

274
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,740
I got something!

275
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,160
Ah!

276
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,180
Eighth, eighty-seven!

277
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,960
Oh my god.

278
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,940
I knew there were warps in this game, but I don't know where
they are, so I'm kind of just like...

279
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,540
Uh... Oh!

280
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,770
We'll find it.

281
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,510
Maybe the pitfall is a secret?

282
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,170
You think so?

283
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,670
Okay, we can't go that way.

284
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,530
This pitfall right here?

285
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,370
I have one life left.

286
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,790
I have one life left.

287
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,850
And I don't remember how I got to the sixth zone to get
those shoes.

288
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,790
Should I risk it for the biscuit?

289
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,210
No.

290
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:58,810
Nice.

291
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,590
Oh my god.

292
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,270
Oh my god.

293
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:04,990
Just throw the bomb.

294
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,590
Just throw the bomb.

295
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,890
There's no risk in throwing the bomb.

296
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,670
Only my sanity.

297
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,370
Oh my gosh, sorry, I don't mean to scream.

298
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,370
This game is just a little stressful, is all.

299
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,250
Hey, hey, hey.

300
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,230
Oh, I ended up killing him.

301
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,110
Oh my god.

302
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,730
Ah, the momentum!

303
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,090
No, the momentum!

304
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,570
Get me going.

305
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,470
Oh.

306
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,810
The mystery adventure.

307
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,010
starts.

308
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:46,930
Okay.

309
00:18:52,990 --> 00:19:02,950
To give you guys any idea, I believe for Korone, it took her
11, almost 12 hours to beat.

310
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:10,010
And for Game Center, for Arino, it took him 8 hours, I
think, to beat.

311
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:30,550
which actually um which actually I have as well this is the
same exact one that he used on the show and it shows you it

312
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:44,730
shows you the different warps and things that you can do so
if we get stuck we're gonna use it okay we're gonna use the

313
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:50,210
guide if we get stuck okay i'm serious

314
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:04,360
nice subway map oh my gosh i'm so close i don't know what
the hitbox is on this thing at all wait so this one took me

315
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:14,780
further maybe i should do this one then 11th zone i'll tell
you in the level where the warp is i am not sure uh it was

316
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,600
this one was it Isn't it?

317
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,280
That we...

318
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,780
50 second!

319
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,020
I can't believe streamer is a cheater.

320
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:25,840
Oh my god.

321
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,740
It's not cheating!

322
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,380
Why would they provide the map and the guide if they didn't
want you to use it?

323
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,960
Oh my god, wait.

324
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,160
Okay, this is where I learn how to jump at least.

325
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,680
Okay, hold on.

326
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,420
Oh, oh, oh.

327
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,560
Okay.

328
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,280
Okay, so far so good.

329
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:55,860
What is that?

330
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,450
Oh, I got a clock.

331
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,280
But also, I don't think calling me a cheater is very nice,
so please actually don't do that.

332
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,960
Because I think if I, you could call me that if I use save
states, but I'm not, so please don't.

333
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,800
Are there two of you now?

334
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,580
Why won't you shoot bombs when I tell you to?

335
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,640
Oh my gosh.

336
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,740
Go, no.

337
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,260
Go away.

338
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,120
Go away.

339
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,680
Go away.

340
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:40,860
Go away.

341
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,420
Go away.

342
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,580
Okay.

343
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:44,440
Oh.

344
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,120
Wow, I traveled.

345
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,840
No one means it maliciously.

346
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,800
They're just teasing.

347
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:02,460
telling you I don't want the teasing today not at least at
least not that kind of teasing because I don't think it's

348
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:11,910
really fair to me thank you oh you

349
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:23,810

offense when it comes to cheating because I am I am I have

350
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:35,090
too much pride even if I have cheated in my life I don't
like to admit or my afterlife even

351
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,650

Hi.

353
00:22:59,680 --> 00:22:59,960
Hi!

354
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,200
Yes!

355

Yes!

356
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,200
Hi!

Okay, nice.

Oh, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it!

362
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,340
Oh my god, please.

00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,340
Thank you.

364
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,160
Is there...

365
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,440
Why does this look so suspicious?

366
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,740
Okay, maybe it's nothing.

367
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,420
I don't want to get caught by the bugs.

368
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,760
No, please!

369
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

370
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,140
Okay, okay.

371
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,700
Oh, okay.

372
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,280
It's just part of the set design.

373
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,080
Please, please!

374
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,460
Let's go.

375
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,560
Wait, do I have eight lives?

376
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,560
Mommy!

377
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,660
Wait, how do I kill the mummy?

378
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,280
Okay.

379
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,300
Okay.

380
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,720
One.

381
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,120
Two.

382
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,700
Three.

383
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,220
Can I jump over this?

384
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:18,980
Oh!

385
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,180
Oh, interesting.

386
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,600
Okay.

387
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,880
I can jump up.

388
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,300
Wait.

389
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:24,840
Oh, interesting.

390
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,040
Okay.

391
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,100
I can jump up.

392
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,780
No, they're coming from behind!

393
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,630
Whoa!

394
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,470
Oh my god.

395
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,150
No, don't kill me.

396
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,730
Maybe I jump here.

397
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,410
Open.

398
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,190
Open.

399
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,810
Oh, here we go.

400
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,430
Here we go.

401
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,450
57th zone.

402
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,630
Oh, my God.

403
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,070
Oh, wow.

404
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,690
Oh, my God.

405
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,850
Oh, my God.

406
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,110
Oh, my God.

407
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,170
Oh, my God.

408
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,380
What is going on?

409
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:16,980
in this.

410
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,420
Okay, just go.

411
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,260
Yo!

412
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,340
Oh my god, no, no, no, no, no.

413
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,540
Maybe he can, maybe, maybe.

414
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:29,700
Can I jump?

415
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:30,180
Okay.

416
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,960
Oh god, please get me out of here.

417
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,880
I don't want to be in there.

418
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,020
Land is not so anymore.

419
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:36,900
I hate it.

420
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,740
Okay, we could just stay up top for now.

421
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:40,660
Probably.

422
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,380
It's probably safe.

423
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,340
Okay, he's gonna fall.

424
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,260
Idiot.

425
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,980
Oh my god, my eyes.

426
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,400
Throw, throw, throw, throw, throw.

427
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,440
Okay, throw, throw, throw, throw, throw.

428
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,680
Okay, we're gaming, we're gaming.

429
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,200
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

430
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,720
Oh, nice, we got both of them.

431
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,660
We're gaming, we're gaming.

432
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,820
Please get me out of the zone, please.

433
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,200
I thought that would work too.

434
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:33,900
Oh my god.

435
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,360
Don't take me back to zone...

436
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,160
What is this?

437
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:39,980
57?

438
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,360
The zone sucks.

439
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,400
The zone sucks.

440
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,960
The zone sucks so much.

441
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,960
My eyes!

442
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,100
How am I supposed to play like this?

443
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,800
Thank god you have unlimited bombs.

444
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,180
But not unlimited time.

445
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,920
I'm so sorry you guys.

446
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,700
I have no idea.

447
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,060
Come on!

448
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,540
Die already!

449
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,800
Okay, but not me.

450
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,110
Okay, I'm gonna wait for him to drop.

451
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:17,830
Okay.

452
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:19,470
Save.

453
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:20,450
Ah!

454
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:21,210
Okay.

455
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,420
Okay.

456
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,760
Oh, that was close.

457
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,020
I always see something on like the right side of my screen.

458
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,400
He's just gonna fall right off.

459
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,180
No!

460
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,850
I don't think it's worth it, you guys.

461
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,070
Staying in this zone!

462
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,190
I don't think it's worth it!

463
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,590
I'd rather just reset!

464
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,550
Okay, I just gotta be good.

465
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,790
I just gotta get good.

466
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:57,790
Speed run.

467
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:04,030
Okay.

468
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:07,610
Just...

469
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,190
Run and jump man!

470
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,190
Run and jump man!

471
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,790
Oh my god, I can't with these guys.

472
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:16,830
The slimes.

473
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,410
Oh, oh, yeah!

474
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:20,850
Oh, yeah!

475
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,400
I'm just gonna die.

476
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,920
I don't wanna do this stage anymore.

477
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,220
We'll come back to it when we have to come back to the 57th
stage.

478
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,480
No!

479
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,260
We'll come back.

480
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,580
Please!

481
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,200
Rip the rave cave.

482
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:01,840
Why?

483
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,810
Okay.

484
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,470
Okay.

485
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,270
The mystery begins.

486
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,030
Oh my god.

487
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,470
Why did I?

488
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:21,990
It's okay.

489
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,770
They said that if a bird poops on you, it's good luck.

490
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,510
I think.

491
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,230
So don't worry about it.

492
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,070
Why is this guy coming up from behind me?

493
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,990
Don't worry about everybody.

494
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,940
Now, also here, I was able to get to the sixth zone.

495
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,780
I can only see green now.

496
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,960
Me too, honestly.

497
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:55,440
What?

498
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,640
Oh my god.

499
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,120
Wait, let me try going to the left, actually.

500
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,810
Wait, can I make it through there?

501
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,890
Oh, never mind.

502
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,010
Never mind.

503
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:11,370
Wait.

504
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,120
Wait.

505
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,260
Oh, treasure.

506
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,120
I don't know what the treasure is worth.

507
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:29,900
I don't know if you can only get things through picking them
up, like the items that we found, or if you can get things

508
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,880
in treasure as well.

509
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,160
I'm not sure.

510
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,220
The warp is all the way to the right.

511
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,900
Yeah, but I wanted to see if there was a second door as well
on the left.

512
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,860
It was up here, though, wasn't it?

513
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,160
Okay, there it is.

514
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,180
But the treasure...

515
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,380
Oh, well.

516
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,880
third zone.

517
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,400
I forgot about this area, to be honest!

518
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,520
I forgot about the fish!

519
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:09,460
Ah!

520
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:12,840
Oh!

521
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,140
I sent a stream labs warning about the flashing lights, but
it got backed up.

522
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,660
Oh, thank you for trying- oh, heads up, they might have
fixed on the switch, but I remember one stage having

523
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,940
horrible flashing lights.

524
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,200
I see your warning, I'm heeding your warning.

525
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,220
There's like no warning for the fish though.

526
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,440
And it's kind of messing me up.

527
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:49,640
Ow!

528
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,920
I was so close too.

529
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,720
I'm so frustrated, I was so close.

530
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,780
Okay, that's it.

531
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,810
It's like passing that level.

532
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:18,150
We'll see if there's a warp past it though, you know, so we
don't have to do it again.

533
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:24,510
As a certified Kusage enthusiast, I've been waiting for
nearly three years for this.

534
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,910
Well, the time has come, unfortunately.

535
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,070
Oh, I killed him!

536
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,270
Yeah, take that.

537
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:41,370
Stupid.

538
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,310
The fish!

539
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,010
The fish!

540
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,030
The fish!

541
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:50,910
Yo, the fish.

542
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,430
There's no way to know where they come either!

543
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,330
Oh my god!

544
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,540
I waited for a fish to come!

545
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,420
I waited!

546
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,200
I waited!

547
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,280
Oh my god.

548
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,930
The fish also waited.

549
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,850
No, I'm not ranging yet.

550
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:35,130
The fish comes every 225 frames.

551
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,230
So it just happens to be every time I jump, eh?

552
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,500
Look at how happy our guy is.

553
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,300
Go on his little Atlantis adventure.

554
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
What could you think the treasure is?

555
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,620
Of Atlantis?

556
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,040
Or not the treasure.

557
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:55,940
The mystery?

558
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,580
Oh my God.

559
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,460
The mystery of Atlantis.

560
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:03,340
Also, there was the one where we warp to the sixth stage.

561
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,780
What was it?

562
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,340
It was on the third stage.

563
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,060
What was it?

564
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:09,880
What was it?

565
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,760
What hole?

566
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,420
Oh!

567
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,540
Sorry, I was not looking.

568
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,820
You fell in the pit.

569
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,080
Yeah, but I don't remember which pit it was.

570
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,660
There were a lot of pits.

571
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,460
Not the arm variety, though I wish they were.

572
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,080
Oh, there's a party going on in there.

573
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:17,060
You would think that throwing a second bomb would like keep
them, keep them down.

574
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:27,020
you know what i mean but it does not in fact they are immune
oh my gosh the best thing about streaming this game is the

575
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:36,100
genuine hot tips and wild lies of trolls and one guys are
indistinguishable it's true it's true actually this time

576
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:45,800
this time we can get the treasure down here let's get the
treasure what could it be there because this game is just it

577
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:51,340
you could say drop a bomb here and you'll get to level 55
and you could be right.

578
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,000
You could be absolutely correct.

579
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,760
And who am I to...

580
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,880
Oh, there's more.

581
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,240
Who am I to say that you're incorrect?

582
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:03,940
Oh, nice.

583
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,460
Wait, there's even more!

584
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,940
What is the point of going all the way down here?

585
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:08,900
Oh gosh.

586
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,240
I'm gonna run out of time though, maybe.

587
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,520
Wait, is it just infinite level?

588
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:16,720
Huh?

589
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,180
I'm gonna run out of time, though.

590
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,560
Wait, just keep going, keep going.

591
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:23,980
Oh!

592
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,400
There's another door!

593
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,600
Ninth zone!

594
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,800
Ninth zone!

595
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,760
Okay, and we got...

596
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,320
What is that?

597
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,880
Hold on.

598
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,580
I got a... something.

599
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:43,840
Eight!

600
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,580
Eighth zone!

601
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,660
Huh?

602
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,520
Wait, I haven't been here though before, right?

603
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,980
Oh my god, thank goodness I threw that.

604
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,120
The momentum is definitely gonna bite me in the butt.

605
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,180
It's in the zone.

606
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,360
I don't know where I'm at.

607
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:24,640
Kui!

608
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:25,640
Kui!

609
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,060
Kui!

610
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:27,840
There we go.

611
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,480
Nice.

612
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:29,800
Big jump.

613
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:39,140
It's making me want to pass more of, like, the regular doors
and find the secret.

614
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,380
Okay, hold on.

615
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,330
I'm going to go from here.

616
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,220
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

617
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:14,220
the over correction I know because like when you jump you
instinctly want to like you instinctly want to press on like

618
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:37,620
you know to move forward because you're just like oh my gosh
and then the momentum too okay okay nice hey I think it's

619
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:44,760
very funny that the guide to this basically encourages you
to like the guide is just like oh by the way there are warps

620
00:38:44,760 --> 00:39:00,830
like you can just totally you can just totally skip a bunch
of this game if you really want to oh hi meant hello hello

621
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:25,770
if I were a hidden door I'd be right right there all right
I'd be right here Dang.

622
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,230
I tried.

623
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:29,610
Oh my gosh, please.

624
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:30,630
There we go.

625
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:37,450
Where is the door here anyway?

626
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:38,990
We haven't seen it yet.

627
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:41,130
Leap!

628
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,600
Jumping in this game is so...

629
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,500
I died to my own boss.

630
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,620
No, biggie.

631
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,260
No, biggie.

632
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,300
Oh,

633
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,530
that was close.

634
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,490
That was a close one.

635
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:27,670
Okay.

636
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,790
I'm getting the hang of the jumping, though, I think.

637
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:32,910
Oh, my God.

638
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:33,990
Oh, that was close.

639
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,550
That was so close.

640
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,910
Oh, my God.

641
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:42,650
That was close, too, because I could have died in my own
bomb again.

642
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:45,970
Okay.

643
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,450
Oh, my God.

644
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,650
We made it!

645
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,150
We made it!

646
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,810
Okay, this is gonna be like...

647
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,350
Do I even have time to make it through this?

648
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,490
Okay, hold on.

649
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:07,950
Oh gosh.

650
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,450
Okay, hold on.

651
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:12,050
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

652
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,450
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

653
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,170
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

654
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,810
I think if I just drop...

655
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,390
Oh, I ran out of time!

656
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,070
I ran out of time!

657
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:27,410
Yo!

658
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,010
Okay.

659
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,230
Speed run.

660
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:33,790
Ugh!

661
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:36,330
Oh!

662
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:39,870
Oh my gosh, I think I pixel perfect.

663
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:41,790
Wait!

664
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:42,370
Okay.

665
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:44,670
Okay.

666
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,430
Yo, I'm gaming?

667
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:52,900
Okay.

668
00:41:58,570 --> 00:41:59,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

669
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:03,950
I thought I touched something on the wall at first.

670
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,670
I was like, what killed me on the wall?

671
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:07,990
Nice.

672
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:09,250
Hi.

673
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:10,770
Nice.

674
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:11,370
Hi.

675
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,590
No, no, not nice.

676
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:14,310
Nice.

677
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,690
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

678
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,330
Where's the door?

679
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,990
Did someone sign the door to darkness?

680
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,470
No, not treasure.

681
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:30,350
Where's the door?

682
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:42,830
Where's...

683
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,110
Where's...

684
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:46,990
Tenth zone!

685
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:50,050
Let's go!

686
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:53,130
Oh no, no wait.

687
00:42:53,130 --> 00:43:02,930
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

688
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:14,460

689
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,040

no, no, no, no, no,

690
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:30,110

no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

691
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:32,450

no, no, no, no, no, no are though I don't think I can get it

693
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,760
a nice sunny

694
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:06,630
day can you jump on the clouds no I don't think so I don't
know I didn't try back to zone one everybody

695
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:12,870
oh good troll are you good

696
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:32,650
I think jumping on the clouds would be too kind.

697
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:38,590
The game would be like, oh, I did it again.

698
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:39,350
I did it again.

699
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:42,090
I saw the one guy and I just ignored the other guy.

700
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:51,040
months ghosty thank you you need an item for cloud walking
okay okay okay

701
00:44:56,270 --> 00:45:06,850
i should just jump over these guys but now which way do i
want to go oh why do you have so much poop what are these

702
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:11,950
birds eating what are these birds eating they have so much
poop

703
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,210
Run!

704
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:22,330
You're humming along to the beach, yes?

705
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:23,850
Always the best.

706
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,210
Which way do we go, guys?

707
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,040
They eat too much fat.

708
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,000
They're eating my dead body once a day.

709
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:51,580
I'm dead.

710
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,700
Once I- my corpse.

711
00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:01,140
That's why they're so- that's why they're able to eat or
poop so much because they're just constantly fading.

712
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,000
Oh!

713
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,680
I'm gonna game over in the first sound!

714
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:20,620
Okay.

715
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,080
Which way do we go though?

716
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,400
It was stage three that got us to stage six.

717
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,800
So let's try and get to stage three and figure out what the-
how to get to stage six.

718
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,220
We'll drop down.

719
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,360
This one.

720
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,040
Good plan.

721
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,880
Still no go that way.

722
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:11,400
Treasure.

723
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:15,660
Please.

724
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:26,380
Uh, wait.

725
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,880
Yeah, we're going to the second one.

726
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:32,900
We're going to the first door, I mean.

727
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,960
Because that got us to stage three.

728
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,300
This one right here.

729
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:39,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

730
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,040
First, can I help it?

731
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,700
They're just really nervous around you.

732
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,100
Okay.

733
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,000
Oh, my gosh.

734
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,260
So I got past a little bit, I think.

735
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,880
Before I fell.

736
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,460
Should I try this one?

737
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,220
Should I try this one, I think?

738
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,680
These fish.

739
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,300
I know.

740
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:08,800
Okay.

741
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,020
No.

742
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,960
I can't remember where I...

743
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,980
Maybe it was a tiny one like this.

744
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,580
Okay, I'm just going to try it this one.

745
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:24,920
Happy one month.

746
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,040
Thank you guys so much.

747
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,120
Oh my gosh, I can't believe I'm playing this.

748
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,160
I have one month.

749
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,960
One month of membership.

750
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,600
Thank you, everybody.

751
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:38,660
Oh, oh.

752
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:40,580
Oh my gosh.

753
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:40,900
Okay.

754
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,740
This is the one I just tried.

755
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,300
It was one of these, wasn't it?

756
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,760
I can't, I don't know which one it was!

757
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,640
Yeah, and thanks for 200k.

758
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:53,400
Okay.

759
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,200
I swear, I think they wait for you to jump.

760
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,040
I don't think it's every seven seconds.

761
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,680
I think they wait for you to jump and then just intercept
you.

762
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,360
It's so rude!

763
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,960
I think they wait for you to like do an action.

764
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:06,240
Oh.

765
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,560
Well, it's not that one.

766
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:12,620
Oh.

767
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,300
I don't know which one.

768
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:38,980
I don't know.

769
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,940
This game is 100% designed to be rude.

770
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:45,240
I agree.

771
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:53,000
I don't think I got- I don't think it was this far that I
made it.

772
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,120
Oh my gosh.

773
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:56,920
Fish.

774
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,580
Six, seven!

775
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,800
You know what, let's just keep going then.

776
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:23,440
One, two, three, four, five.

777
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,820
Oh, oh yeah.

778
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,320
Sorry.

779
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,940
Press the wrong button.

780
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,000
Was it worth it?

781
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,420
Okay, we're gonna find it now.

782
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:57,800
this one it was not that one this one no maybe it was um
maybe it was the one after that maybe this one

783
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:15,360
wait This one?

784
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:16,860
Ah!

785
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,020
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

786
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,480
Six zone!

787
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,220
Six zone!

788
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,900
Oh my god, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

789
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,060
I got an item!

790
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,100
I got the shoe- I got shoes!

791
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,940
Oh no, wait, this one was really hard.

792
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,160
No.

793
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:39,960
Ah!

794
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:52,500
You know what, it's fine because we wasted some lives on
level 3, so it's whatever.

795
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,140
Don't worry about it.

796
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,760
We wasted some lives on level 3, so...

797
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,480
Okay, we gotta get to level 3 without dying.

798
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,280
Oh my gosh.

799
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:04,540
Oh my god.

800
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,800
No, no, no.

801
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:09,890
Okay.

802
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:13,230
Oh.

803
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:14,590
Oh.

804
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:16,370
Thanks, Varylant.

805
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,640
Takeshi's challenge?

806
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:24,580
I think it's on par.

807
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,320
I think it's on par.

808
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,180
Second zone.

809
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,300
This jeopardizes your goal.

810
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:46,900
It's okay.

811
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,120
It's okay.

812
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:52,960
It's okay.

813
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:53,740
This one's easy.

814
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,620
There's no pitfalls.

815
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,000
Just gotta avoid these guys.

816
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,040
Why am I so weak?

817
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,100
I can't even handle a hermit crab.

818
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:08,720
Oh my god, how did I live that?

819
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,020
How did I live that?

820
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,120
What is this?

821
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,620
Atlantis is so mysterious.

822
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:18,580
Truly.

823
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,600
The most mysterious place.

824
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:24,860
Okay.

825
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,080
Third zone.

826
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,880
Have you seen the size of those hermit crabs?

827
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,880
Still, they're really cool too, like they're wearing their
sunglasses.

828
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,080
Okay, now I have to find this one.

829
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,300
You rage!

830
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,460
Personally like this Mint Center CX arrow we've got.

831
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,140
I don't mind.

832
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:05,460
Like, I think some people are just like, I hate playing rage
games because you know they're designed to make you rage but

833
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:20,380
I personally am like a fan of being like of hopefully
beating them oh my god no okay we have three lives

834
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:32,640
like I think it's like the best feeling in the world to
clear something that is Is meant to be so frustrating.

835
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,220
Okay, it was one.

836
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,620
I see the fish.

837
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,920
I see the fish and my finger still says, Hey!

838
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,820
You know what, I think I'm just gonna die.

839
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:50,940
Actually, no.

840
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:52,940
I'm not.

841
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,160
I will continue on.

842
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,140
I will continue onward.

843
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:07,320
When the going gets tough, you'll pull through like you
always do.

844
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:08,860
Thank you.

845
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:11,360
Okay.

846
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:15,570
It was.

847
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:17,650
This one.

848
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:18,850
Yes.

849
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,360
Oh my god, please.

850
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:26,200
Please.

851
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,200
Nice.

852
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,080
Okay, eighth zone.

853
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,780
Alright, alright, alright.

854
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,160
Alright, alright.

855
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,840
I wonder what the boots don't make me faster or anything.

856
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,640
I don't think.

857
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,020
I hope not.

858
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,740
Please, God, don't give me more speed in this game.

859
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,100
I will cry.

860
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,740
I will cry.

861
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:59,160
If I have to go any further or faster than I have, please
actually just give me like, just stop the momentum.

862
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,400
That would be the better gift, truly.

863
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:09,440
When they like start coming back to live, these little
hermit crabs, it's like two seconds that they give you of a

864
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:09,760
warning.

865
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:10,620
It's crazy.

866
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,480
Momentum.

867
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,880
I felt so close.

868
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:21,800
Momentum.

869
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:25,190
Okay.

870
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:27,850
That was so close.

871
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:30,230
Momentum.

872
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:30,990
Oh!

873
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:32,270
Oh!

874
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:37,950
Oh!

875
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:39,630
Okay, okay, okay.

876
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:41,310
I think I can just drop there.

877
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:42,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

878
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:43,530
Okay.

879
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:44,110
Okay.

880
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:44,810
Sorry.

881
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:48,130
Oh my god, I'm so stressed.

882
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:50,130
Okay, treasure chest.

883
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:52,470
Nice.

884
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:07,130
The time limit!

885
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:09,430
Oh!

886
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:12,110
It's so brutal!

887
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:14,950
You would think that 900 seconds is a lot.

888
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:19,610
Even Mario gives you, like, a thousand doesn't don't they

889
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:32,540
sometimes i gotta take my time not in no there's no time in
atlantis

890
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:50,110
oh oh oh my god oh oh my gosh that was so close let's wait
for this guy to go down yep there we go okay here okay okay

891
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:56,850

892
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:12,150
Oh Pain

893
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:31,730
You know what I'll say 1% We're at 1% Wow, what's this
level?

894
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:38,890
It's funny because I can't I can like kind of control this
guy like I can jump, but I I can't throw anything and also I

895
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,350
didn't make that jump either I don't know.

896
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:42,510
I don't understand.

897
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:43,090
Wait.

898
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:48,890
Oh, I ended up dying Okay, let's go.

899
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:57,370
There's no better way than I'd want to spend my Saturday.

900
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:10,010
No better way than I want to spend my Saturday traveling.

901
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:12,150
Okay, I said 900 seconds.

902
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:13,690
These are way faster than seconds.

903
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:15,330
Ah!

904
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:21,110
No better way than spend my Saturday.

905
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:24,190
Just 2% now.

906
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:31,650
I'm dying on purpose by the way so that we can just I wonder
if there's a way for me to just reset.

907
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:34,610
I don't think so.

908
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:38,290
Just let me die already.

909
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,530
No better way.

910
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:43,450
Spend my Saturday.

911
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,480
Bada-dada-dada-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-

912
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:56,130
When I'm trying to die, the deaths feel so...

913
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:59,510
Oh wait, I instinctively just jumped over him.

914
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,750
You could be watching an idol live, and yet here you are.

915
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:10,810
Where would I be watching an idol live?

916
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:13,350
I'm not in Japan.

917
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:16,150
Hello.

918
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:21,070
Hello.

919
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:24,030
No, no, no, no.

920
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:37,780
Poop, poop.

921
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:39,800
Stage two.

922
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,760
You could be watching Idol Live VOD on YouTube.

923
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:46,620
So true.

924
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:56,120
Actually, it's like so frustrating sometimes being for an
Idol fan because like, they film shows.

925
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:57,800
I know they do.

926
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,640
I see the cameras in the back.

927
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,140
But they don't post them.

928
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:02,740
Like, 99% of the time.

929
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,880
They never post the show itself.

930
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:07,800
So if I miss a show, like, that's kind of it.

931
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,680
And sometimes they'll perform, like, a special set list.

932
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:16,420
It's mostly frustrating for birthdays because they'll
perform, like, a special set list.

933
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,060
And I'm like, no, please.

934
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:19,360
Please.

935
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,440
I just, oh, I want to see you perform this song.

936
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:27,200
I think it is for them to, like, watch back and practice
and, like, you know.

937
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:40,220
like where maybe they made mistakes or certain parts but
like it's still so it's just so sad okay i'm waiting for

938
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:47,430
fish okay it was the third one here

939
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:24,560
fish Fish?

940
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:33,520
Oh!

941
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:34,240
Oh!

942
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:35,980
Okay.

943
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,020
This one.

944
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:39,880
Six zones!

945
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:41,300
Okay, okay, okay.

946
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,860
Oh my gosh, sorry.

947
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:48,880
He came out of nowhere.

948
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:50,700
Okay.

949
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,420
Gotta go fast.

950
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,760
Okay, this is not very fast.

951
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,020
Gotta go fast.

952
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:00,200
Pew.

953
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:04,440
Pew.

954
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:08,860
Faster!

955
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:11,320
Nazo Man!

956
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:15,180
Please, faster, faster!

957
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,320
Just ride like your little legs versus ride.

958
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:22,060
Just ride.

959
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:23,600
Oh my god.

960
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:25,360
Nice.

961
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:26,200
Okay.

962
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,460
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

963
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:28,700
Okay.

964
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:31,180
This part is tricky, but we got this.

965
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:31,740
Oh, gosh.

966
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,180
Oh, gosh.

967
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,100
I don't have this.

968
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:36,060
Okay.

969
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:42,090
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

970
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:44,330
Please.

971
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:45,930
You know what?

972
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:46,710
Screw it.

973
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:50,810
I don't have...

974
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:51,490
AHHHHH!

975
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:57,380
AHHHHH!

976
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,480
AHHHHH!

977
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:58,720
AHHHHH!

978
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:59,360
AHHHHH!

979
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,560
We're fine.

980
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:06,620
Oh my god.

981
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:07,820
Where did you come from?

982
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,920
I even threw the bomb and it didn't even affect him.

983
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:16,920
Just run.

984
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:18,360
Run and jump.

985
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:28,910
Oh my god.

986
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:29,750
Oh my god.

987
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:30,670
Oh my god.

988
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:31,550
Okay.

989
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:33,090
No!

990
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:35,850
Oh.

991
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,200
Oh my god.

992
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:45,900
Oh my god.

993
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:46,200
Oh!

994
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:48,600
I think actually that did stop him.

995
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:55,180
I don't know why this stage gives me so much trouble.

996
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:57,720
It's so much hopping.

997
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:04,440
Oh no,

998
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,260
and he's right there.

999
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:15,400
Okay.

1000
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:20,230
The momentum.

1001
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:25,670
Don't forget the basics of CQC mods or something.

1002
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:27,330
Yeah, thanks.

1003
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:29,550
Oh, the momentum.

1004
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:31,910
Oh, the momentum.

1005
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:36,890
That wasn't even me overcorrecting at that time.

1006
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:39,570
Okay, just in case.

1007
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:41,690
Sometimes I die.

1008
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:43,470
Sometimes I don't.

1009
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,630
The game doesn't even know.

1010
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:50,070
I don't know what my own hitbox is.

1011
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:51,330
I have no idea.

1012
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:54,790
I have no idea!

1013
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:15,090
Tough time never lasts.

1014
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:17,470
Only tough people last.

1015
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:22,550
You guys, I don't think we're making it to level 9, so...

1016
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:25,810
You aren't playing through OBS, are you?

1017
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:27,430
No, I'm actually not.

1018
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:28,630
I thought...

1019
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,330
I'm actually not playing through OBS.

1020
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:32,630
It's only been an hour.

1021
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,940
Maybe try with OBS.

1022
01:06:58,660 --> 01:06:59,140
Maybe.

1023
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:01,660
Maybe I'm too used to OBS now.

1024
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:07,910
Where did the other one, the other door in here, take me?

1025
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:08,650
I can't remember.

1026
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:09,430
Oh, okay.

1027
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:11,810
Just run.

1028
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:14,950
Just run and jump.

1029
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:16,690
There we go.

1030
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,580
Oh, guys, there's so many tiny little...

1031
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:27,420
Oh, I thought I was gonna die there.

1032
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:29,760
I thought for sure I would die there.

1033
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:31,260
Okay, third zone.

1034
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,120
No fish, no fish, no fish, no fish, no fish, no fish.

1035
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,280
No fish, sorry, I'm allergic.

1036
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:40,720
To fish.

1037
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:41,400
Okay.

1038
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:42,780
Fish.

1039
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:49,140
Fish.

1040
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,000
Here.

1041
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:56,040
Nice!

1042
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,460
Nice, nice, nice.

1043
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:01,620
Oh, shoot.

1044
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:02,180
I forgot.

1045
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,880
Why is everything pooping on me?

1046
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:06,600
Okay.

1047
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:10,470
Ah, please!

1048
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:14,670
Okay, okay, okay.

1049
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:16,990
Okay, okay.

1050
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:17,430
I

1051
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:29,840
thought I was gonna land on top of that other one, so...

1052
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:31,070
Okay.

1053
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:35,650
The music in this, I think, stresses me out.

1054
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:37,510
It's so fast-paced, you know?

1055
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:39,210
Oh my god, I thought I was gonna die.

1056
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:41,290
Oh, I thought I was gonna die!

1057
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:44,650
Big leaps.

1058
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:47,750
Oh my god.

1059
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:48,530
Okay.

1060
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:50,370
Okay, all right.

1061
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:51,570
Very good.

1062
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:55,730
Okay, nothing here.

1063
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:57,030
Nothing here.

1064
01:08:58,450 --> 01:08:58,750
Okay.

1065
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:13,990
I have to wait.

1066
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:18,720
I have to wait.

1067
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,980
I jumped but I didn't.

1068
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:23,260
Maybe do it soon enough.

1069
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,560
Come on, come on, come on.

1070
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:31,740
There's no time to lose.

1071
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:34,340
Oh my god.

1072
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:38,060
Why wasn't he affected by the bomb?

1073
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,700
Why wasn't he affected by the bomb?

1074
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:03,670
Sometimes it really doesn't read my inputs, but that's okay.

1075
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:07,130
Like there, I tried jumping just then.

1076
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:08,330
Might be my controller.

1077
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:10,890
No, no, it's just a skill issue.

1078
01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:12,850
Real gamers don't blame the controller.

1079
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,140
I'm a gamer.

1080
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:20,560
I'm a gamer.

1081
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:22,980
Yeah, we do.

1082
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:27,460
Actually, maybe that's the most gamer thing to do is to
blame the controller.

1083
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:32,430
Why?

1084
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:33,310
There we go.

1085
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:35,630
Okay.

1086
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:41,190
Please, please.

1087
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:42,410
Thank you.

1088
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:46,560
Okay.

1089
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:48,340
We made it to the treasure chest.

1090
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,000
Okay, just don't even try.

1091
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:50,640
Just go.

1092
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:51,800
Just go.

1093
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:52,380
Just go.

1094
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:56,110
Please.

1095
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:56,890
Please.

1096
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:58,130
Just make it to the door.

1097
01:10:59,450 --> 01:10:59,970
Okay.

1098
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,590
Oh my god!

1099
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:05,810
Tenth zone!

1100
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:09,550
Oh, tenth zone!

1101
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:13,170
Okay, clouds.

1102
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:19,360
Oh my gosh.

1103
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,940
No, I missed the star!

1104
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:24,540
Uh-oh.

1105
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:26,540
It's Jover.

1106
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,240
It's Jover, you guys.

1107
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:31,940
I missed the...

1108
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:34,150
I missed the...

1109
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,060
I missed it.

1110
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,320
Maybe there will be another one.

1111
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,060
Maybe there will be another one.

1112
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:49,220
Oh!

1113
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,420
That was me.

1114
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,140
Oh wait, we got another chance.

1115
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,040
We got another chance.

1116
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:57,040
Hi.

1117
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:58,920
Hi.

1118
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:00,560
Hi.

1119
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:08,460
I was too...

1120
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:09,760
I got it!

1121
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:10,900
I got it!

1122
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:12,160
I got

1123
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:16,020
it!

1124
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:16,780
Oh my god.

1125
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,980
Oh my

1126
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:25,730
god.

1127
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:34,660
Oh my

1128
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:42,170
god.

1129
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:44,550
Wait!

1130
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:47,930
That was from here, right?

1131
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:49,570
Yes.

1132
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:50,870
Okay.

1133
01:12:55,630 --> 01:13:00,470
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, okay, okay.

1134
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:10,670
This is the most stressful level.

1135
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:13,370
Oh my god, this is the most stressful level.

1136
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:16,570
I remember playing in my entire afterlife.

1137
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:19,570
Oh my god, oh my god, you guys.

1138
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:21,250
I can barely breathe.

1139
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:24,050
breathe.

1140
01:13:24,590 --> 01:13:26,010
Oh my gosh, I can barely breathe.

1141
01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:33,390
You're stressing me out.

1142
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,130
It's, what am I doing?

1143
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:36,230
It's the game.

1144
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:39,310
Oh my god.

1145
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:44,310
Beep, beep, beep.

1146
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:47,350
Don't.

1147
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:50,130
No.

1148
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:51,050
No.

1149
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:02,490
Okay.

1150
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:03,890
Okay.

1151
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:09,450
I think this level wouldn't be as bad if I didn't have to go
through level 8 before.

1152
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:10,290
Oh no!

1153
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:16,290
If I didn't have to go through level 8 before, I would...

1154
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:27,070
Oh!

1155
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:29,830
Oh!

1156
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:41,090
Poop.

1157
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:47,630
Called it, man.

1158
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:49,370
You guys.

1159
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:52,770
That's why I don't have a death counter.

1160
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:55,030
No, my.

1161
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:01,450
When someone way better at games than me.

1162
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:04,310
Takes three hours on one stage.

1163
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:04,770
I think.

1164
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:06,330
I think we.

1165
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:08,450
You know what?

1166
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:09,110
I'm going to go up.

1167
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:13,260
I think we can.

1168
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:15,480
Right.

1169
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,620
recognize the trouble we are in.

1170
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,580
But I have to get it eventually.

1171
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:24,800
I have to get it eventually.

1172
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:27,780
It has to come eventually.

1173
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:29,640
Death count.

1174
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:32,660
Pretty much.

1175
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:34,620
Okay, fish.

1176
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,180
Oh, that was close.

1177
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:46,660
Okay.

1178
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:50,560
Six zone.

1179
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:51,520
Okay.

1180
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:04,630
Level 8.

1181
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:05,990
Level 8.

1182
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:10,190
The pain of my existence, level 8.

1183
01:16:12,930 --> 01:16:15,290
Because it's so long!

1184
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:16,910
It's also like so...

1185
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:17,850
Oh my god.

1186
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:19,890
It's also so long.

1187
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:23,790
It takes so long to get through it.

1188
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:28,610
Maybe it's just me.

1189
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:31,930
Maybe, you know what, looking at it, it's actually not that
long.

1190
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:33,170
I think it's just me.

1191
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:34,750
Okay.

1192
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:44,830
I ran and jumped!

1193
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:46,050
I ran and jumped!

1194
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:52,270
I ran and I jumped and I still only did a tiny jump.

1195
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:00,700
That could have been close.

1196
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:15,030
Come on.

1197
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:32,770
That didn't even do anything there.

1198
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:35,890
That didn't even do anything there.

1199
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:42,770
I just, I just, I just jumped and the guy ran, decided to
run on his own.

1200
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:49,260
I threw my bomb too late.

1201
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,340
Oh, yo, yo.

1202
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:54,920
Look on the bright side.

1203
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,480
You could be playing a harder NES game.

1204
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:11,120
Look on the bright side.

1205
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:12,340
This game is easy.

1206
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:17,700
Look on the bright side.

1207
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:20,560
This game, a baby could do it.

1208
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:23,860
Thank you.

1209
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:24,580
You know what?

1210
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:31,680
Always look on the bright side.

1211
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,220
Oh, I don't know why sometimes I die to the bombs and
sometimes I don't.

1212
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:51,890
I think if I jump, I don't die to the bomb.

1213
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:56,070
Thanks for the super chat!

1214
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:56,670
I'll read it.

1215
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:58,010
Is there a reason for...

1216
01:18:58,010 --> 01:18:58,330
Oh, wait.

1217
01:18:58,490 --> 01:18:59,190
Insane timer?

1218
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:00,190
I have no idea.

1219
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:05,230
Because this game, I think, was designed to literally hate
you.

1220
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:08,870
It's designed to make you so sad.

1221
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:14,550
It's designed to make you really, really sad.

1222
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:16,190
Please, please.

1223
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:16,510
Okay.

1224
01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:19,910
There we go.

1225
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:20,230
Okay.

1226
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:22,930
It's designed to make you cry.

1227
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:36,010
We're so close.

1228
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:41,050
Okay, we have only three lives left.

1229
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:43,690
Thank you, Kyoki!

1230
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:59,910
I feel like I'm at least getting better at the previous
level though, so...

1231
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:02,410
Okay.

1232
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:04,030
Got the star.

1233
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:06,470
Oh my god, no!

1234
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:09,990
Jump is so tricky.

1235
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:12,510
One life left, everybody.

1236
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:13,550
What if I go backwards?

1237
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:15,150
What if I go this way?

1238
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:17,250
Never mind!

1239
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:40,930
Jump!

1240
01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:43,970
And jump!

1241
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:45,330
Poop!

1242
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:46,910
Door.

1243
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:49,530
You earned that game over.

1244
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:50,550
Yeah, I did.

1245
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,310
What was she cooking?

1246
01:20:52,670 --> 01:20:54,230
Look, I have one life left.

1247
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:55,650
What am I gonna do?

1248
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:59,510
Experiment when I have 50 lives?

1249
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:01,090
What?

1250
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:04,010
This game needs to give you 50 lives, speaking of.

1251
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:06,610
The life...

1252
01:21:06,610 --> 01:21:08,970
They need to give you more lives in this game.

1253
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:20,210
Oh my gosh.

1254
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:20,530
Wait.

1255
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:22,550
Oh my god, I didn't think I would make that.

1256
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:24,910
I didn't think I would make that at all.

1257
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:28,370
Look it!

1258
01:21:29,770 --> 01:21:31,290
There are cheats that let you add lives?

1259
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:32,390
No way, really!

1260
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:39,350
This one I can take a little bit slower because...

1261
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:42,090
Oh my gosh.

1262
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:45,650
Because it's right, like, here that way.

1263
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:47,750
Fish.

1264
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:52,070
It's right here.

1265
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:56,850
You're just holding back on how good you are to make us feel
better.

1266
01:21:58,410 --> 01:21:58,810
I...

1267
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:01,710
I encourage you, play this game.

1268
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:03,290
Play it.

1269
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:06,050
Play it.

1270
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:08,150
I encourage you.

1271
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:18,510
I'm not looking to beat any records.

1272
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:19,370
Oh my god.

1273
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:20,090
No!

1274
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:30,350
That was so dirty.

1275
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:32,570
That was so dirty.

1276
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:39,190
Oh my gosh.

1277
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:40,730
That was so dirty.

1278
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:42,550
But no, actually play it.

1279
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:43,050
Try it.

1280
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:46,730
I'm not trying to beat any records here.

1281
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:57,050
But just to give you an idea, Korone San took about 12
hours.

1282
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:06,530
And in Game Center CX, between two people, Adino took about
eight and a half, eight hours?

1283
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:07,310
Eight and a half hours?

1284
01:23:10,890 --> 01:23:13,190
So, what is the speed run on this game?

1285
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:16,730
What is the speed run?

1286
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:17,670
on this game.

1287
01:23:18,050 --> 01:23:19,330
I don't even want to know actually.

1288
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:20,750
I think I'll throw up.

1289
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:21,610
Ah!

1290
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:22,390
Wait.

1291
01:23:23,690 --> 01:23:24,010
Uh-oh.

1292
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:25,370
I'm losing a lot of time.

1293
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:26,370
Oh gosh.

1294
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:27,470
Okay.

1295
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:29,690
I have to be quicker with these.

1296
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:30,990
Okay.

1297
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:33,130
No.

1298
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:34,190
Oh gosh.

1299
01:23:34,290 --> 01:23:34,850
I gotta be fast.

1300
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:35,590
I gotta be fast.

1301
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:36,310
No!

1302
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:40,450
Three minutes!

1303
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:41,850
Oh, for Tass Run though?

1304
01:23:41,970 --> 01:23:42,270
Come on.

1305
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:43,150
That doesn't count.

1306
01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:44,870
Tass Run doesn't count.

1307
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:49,410
I mean, for real people.

1308
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,320
I'll look in a second.

1309
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:06,380
I'm concentrating.

1310
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:09,020
Concentrating.

1311
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:11,860
Holy cow.

1312
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:13,240
How do I make that?

1313
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:17,000
Just mint.

1314
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,200
Just mint gaming.

1315
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:20,100
Oh my gosh, please.

1316
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:20,940
I need to make this.

1317
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,000
Why?

1318
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:23,460
Please, sir.

1319
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:24,700
There we go.

1320
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:25,820
Okay.

1321
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:27,420
Okay.

1322
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:31,630
There we go.

1323
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:32,510
Okay.

1324
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:34,450
Here's the tough one.

1325
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:41,460
I think, I don't think 225 is Taz.

1326
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:42,360
Really?

1327
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,260
No way.

1328
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:46,160
No way!

1329
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:54,430
I need this guy to stop falling from the ceiling.

1330
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:55,550
He's scaring me.

1331
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:57,410
He's stressing me out a little bit.

1332
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:14,910
No, why are you gonna be down there?

1333
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:23,630
Wait.

1334
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:26,850
Okay, okay.

1335
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:30,710
Okay, here, here's where I really mess up.

1336
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:32,650
So, okay, there we go.

1337
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:34,070
Nice, nice, nice soup.

1338
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:35,990
I think I have time.

1339
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:39,090
But I'm not gonna risk it.

1340
01:25:40,210 --> 01:25:42,250
Just go, don't risk it for the biscuit.

1341
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:44,910
It's not worth it, it's not even delicious, it's dry.

1342
01:25:45,670 --> 01:25:47,190
Don't risk it for the biscuit.

1343
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:48,130
Okay.

1344
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:49,990
Okay.

1345
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:53,730
Oh, hold on.

1346
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:55,370
Oh, hold on.

1347
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:57,200
Hold on.

1348
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:07,460
Mods, doko.

1349
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,580
They're probably just like, we can't watch this anymore.

1350
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,620
This is...

1351
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:22,320
This is too stressful.

1352
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:25,660
This is too stressful on my little heart.

1353
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:28,760
Oh.

1354
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:44,770
Oh, how did I make that?

1355
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:46,110
Oh my gosh, please, please, please.

1356
01:26:46,530 --> 01:26:48,030
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1357
01:26:49,210 --> 01:26:51,030
Oh, the timer is just going.

1358
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:52,010
It's just going.

1359
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,940
Oh, that was a pretty good run, though.

1360
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:08,900
That was a pretty good run.

1361
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:10,640
That was a pretty good run.

1362
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:12,260
All things.

1363
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:14,600
All things considered.

1364
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:20,740
You.

1365
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:25,000
You!

1366
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,060
You!

1367
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:28,160
You!

1368
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:29,980
Oh, well, I didn't make it anyway.

1369
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:32,380
Oh, gosh.

1370
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,040
You're getting better.

1371
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:37,780
I don't think there's a way to get better at this game, I'll
be honest.

1372
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:41,860
I think this game is just so, so evil.

1373
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:46,200
This game is not meant to, you're not supposed to get better
at this game.

1374
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:49,420
I don't think, I think...

1375
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:51,360
No!

1376
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:56,060
I don't know how much skill comes into this.

1377
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:57,040
That's what I'm saying.

1378
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:03,580
I have to, like, at least with this one, I feel like I have
to memorize.

1379
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:05,820
Why?

1380
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:11,360
I have to memorize how...

1381
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:18,380
Where I stand, the standing placement, and how much I press
down on the button, and everything.

1382
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:20,200
I have to memorize so much.

1383
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:23,400
Oh, oh, I...

1384
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:24,540
Sorry, I totally it.

1385
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:34,670
Oh, the game was made by a sadist.

1386
01:28:40,230 --> 01:28:41,890
I'm going to start up my...

1387
01:28:41,890 --> 01:28:42,610
I'm going to...

1388
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:43,410
I got a coffee.

1389
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:47,950
It might not actually be good for me to have this because
it'll make my hands shaky, but...

1390
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:56,600
I'm okay.

1391
01:28:59,120 --> 01:28:59,420
Yeah.

1392
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:00,900
Hmm.

1393
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:04,240
No.

1394
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:10,840
Mmm.

1395
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:15,160
Rage back down to zero.

1396
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:19,020
Yummy, yummy.

1397
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,560
Just count your lucky stars.

1398
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:23,140
This isn't super pitfall.

1399
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,860
You'd be mentally barfing.

1400
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:32,000
Wait, you wanna take that back?

1401
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:35,960
You wanna take that back?

1402
01:29:57,950 --> 01:29:58,390
Actually...

1403
01:29:58,390 --> 01:29:58,950
Hold on.

1404
01:29:59,950 --> 01:30:00,710
I'm gonna die.

1405
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:05,810
Because I do want to see how far I can... Okay, hold on.

1406
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:11,830
I want to get to the level 54 again.

1407
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:14,890
I want to go that route.

1408
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:18,910
Because I'm pretty sure there's another warp there.

1409
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:23,130
Because from what I remember, there's a way to get all the
way to level 99.

1410
01:30:25,010 --> 01:30:25,450
What?

1411
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:27,350
So...

1412
01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:27,890
Sorry.

1413
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:30,310
Maybe I should have done this before I...

1414
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:32,310
No, no, we're not gonna go through the rave room.

1415
01:30:32,410 --> 01:30:33,590
I think you can skip it.

1416
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:37,150
I'm gonna check the guide real quick once we're done.

1417
01:30:37,650 --> 01:30:38,430
Yeah, there's a hidden door.

1418
01:30:38,590 --> 01:30:40,010
Okay, okay, I thought so, I thought so.

1419
01:30:40,630 --> 01:30:41,630
I thought so, I thought so.

1420
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:43,090
So we're gonna...

1421
01:30:43,090 --> 01:30:44,250
We're gonna die.

1422
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:46,170
And we're gonna...

1423
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:47,950
Because I do wanna see...

1424
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:51,870
I mean, if I can just beat the game by getting a level 99,
then...

1425
01:30:55,010 --> 01:30:55,330
Okay.

1426
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:56,950
Was that my last one?

1427
01:30:57,970 --> 01:31:00,970
Yeah, okay strategy guide.

1428
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:08,250
Okay, let me see now Okay, oh here so

1429
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:17,990
11 this is wait is that where we know 11 52.

1430
01:31:18,510 --> 01:31:20,210
Yes, yes, yes for 91.

1431
01:31:20,610 --> 01:31:21,070
Okay, okay.

1432
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:23,830
Okay, okay, okay, so a 1 to 11

1433
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:46,720
Okay It doesn't say how I get to level 91.

1434
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:49,820
Hmm.

1435
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:52,120
What the hell is this map?

1436
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:55,120
This is the levels for this game.

1437
01:31:57,340 --> 01:31:58,980
This is the levels for this game.

1438
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:00,820
See, you can go 1, 2, 3, 4.

1439
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:04,400
Wait, you can't even go from 4 to 5?

1440
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:05,620
What is that?

1441
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:05,840
Wait.

1442
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:28,280
5 there there is huh oh it's oh I see it's below 2 okay 5
can also get you to 24 but how do you get 4 to 5 what the

1443
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:41,000
heck is that thing 5 to 6 6 and then 6 to 7 You can go...

1444
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:41,280
Wait.

1445
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,240
But we're going to go to 11.

1446
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:49,680
And then we're going to go to 52.

1447
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:55,940
I can't read that.

1448
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:57,300
Gimetsuwap.

1449
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,660
And then he can go to zone 91.

1450
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:04,380
But what's the warp?

1451
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,320
The 91 to 95.

1452
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:09,680
To 93.

1453
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:10,940
96.

1454
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:12,600
Yeah, we can get...

1455
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:27,340
the final oh oops we can get there maybe 11 is the highway
what about 20 to 100.

1456
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:32,160
yeah how do we okay 9 8 20.

1457
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:37,060
right wait okay hold on oh

1458
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:50,860
so nine to eight to twenty wait nine to eight to twenty to a
hundred that's a plausible possible path yeah let's try it

1459
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:59,460
out oh yeah sorry i keep clicking on the wrong thing okay
there we go okay it was from two right two nine eight twenty

1460
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:18,130
Oh, two, two, two.

1461
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:20,230
Wait, okay, two to a...

1462
01:34:20,230 --> 01:34:24,370
That's probably the one where we run past this door here.

1463
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:29,540
So let's just stay down.

1464
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:30,840
Stay down.

1465
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:32,900
We'll stay down.

1466
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:36,080
Oh, my God.

1467
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,220
Oh, that was close.

1468
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:40,820
I was so close.

1469
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:44,400
Run past you.

1470
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,140
Okay, run past you.

1471
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:58,520
I don't remember where the door is.

1472
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:00,440
Oh, that's so unfair.

1473
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:03,240
They're on top of the treasure box.

1474
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:09,160
I don't have much time, though, so I gotta zip.

1475
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:10,960
I gotta zip itty.

1476
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:12,040
Okay, never mind.

1477
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:13,900
Door.

1478
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:16,400
Did someone say...

1479
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:20,400
save the door to darkness?

1480
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:24,100
Okay, ninth zone.

1481
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:25,820
Wait, was this right?

1482
01:35:31,570 --> 01:35:32,590
Was this correct?

1483
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:37,210
I think this gives me an extra life.

1484
01:35:38,790 --> 01:35:39,630
From nine to eight.

1485
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:40,470
Oh, that's right, yes.

1486
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:42,190
And then we went back to eight.

1487
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:42,830
Yes, yes, yes.

1488
01:35:43,090 --> 01:35:44,170
And then eight to twenty.

1489
01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:45,230
Wait.

1490
01:35:45,690 --> 01:35:46,330
Oh, no.

1491
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:47,650
Oh, no.

1492
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:48,750
Wait.

1493
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:54,690
There's Oh, oh god.

1494
01:35:58,830 --> 01:36:01,570
For some reason, my brain did not comprehend that.

1495
01:36:01,670 --> 01:36:01,830
Okay.

1496
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:11,370
Let's look for any places like that a door, like, I feel
like in here, you know, like, and a little dip at the

1497
01:36:11,370 --> 01:36:13,670
bottom, like a door.

1498
01:36:13,910 --> 01:36:14,310
Oh, wait.

1499
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:15,830
Unless I run past.

1500
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:17,170
Oh, shoot.

1501
01:36:17,370 --> 01:36:19,070
Wait, I already messed up then at that point.

1502
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:29,430
messed up but that's okay because I've wasted a lot of time
I don't know if it's a hidden door or if it's a door past

1503
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:44,850
the initial door but that's okay this song in particular
will haunt me you wouldn't think a ghost could get haunted

1504
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:50,250
but...

1505
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:51,330
Okay, nice.

1506
01:36:55,990 --> 01:36:58,170
I touched him.

1507
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:19,150
What if I'm, like, really deathly allergic to shellfish or
something?

1508
01:37:20,450 --> 01:37:24,830
And so that's why it's, like, really dangerous for me.

1509
01:37:27,090 --> 01:37:29,070
To touch these guys, you know?

1510
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:36,600
I'm just so...

1511
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:38,280
deathly allergic to shellfish.

1512
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:41,120
Oh my gosh.

1513
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,240
I almost overcorrected that.

1514
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:45,700
That would have been bad.

1515
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:46,760
Nice.

1516
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:48,260
Alright.

1517
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:49,700
That was...

1518
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:50,040
Alright.

1519
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:51,400
Now we...

1520
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:51,880
Okay.

1521
01:38:21,130 --> 01:38:22,930
Jeez, you can hit yourself.

1522
01:38:23,170 --> 01:38:24,150
Yeah, you can.

1523
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:24,970
But only...

1524
01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:27,990
I think it's only if you hit yourself in the face.

1525
01:38:28,890 --> 01:38:30,010
Thank you for the pink.

1526
01:38:30,370 --> 01:38:31,070
Thank you.

1527
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:32,930
I mean, you could blame me.

1528
01:38:32,950 --> 01:38:38,850
for like throwing it preemptively but also can you blame me
for throwing it preemptively because like

1529
01:38:41,930 --> 01:38:46,410
sometimes i'm like am i gonna make this like see

1530
01:38:50,870 --> 01:38:52,230
like that

1531
01:38:56,470 --> 01:38:58,210
okay nice

1532
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:16,810
we wait for him to drop down then we jump across like so
Okay.

1533
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:22,070
Now we're running past this door.

1534
01:39:24,650 --> 01:39:27,650
Hopefully, it's shortly past.

1535
01:39:28,810 --> 01:39:30,810
I got

1536
01:39:33,910 --> 01:39:34,270
something.

1537
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:37,470
Okay.

1538
01:39:39,130 --> 01:39:39,390
Oh!

1539
01:39:39,670 --> 01:39:40,970
Oh, oh, oh, oh my god!

1540
01:39:42,190 --> 01:39:42,990
Please, please!

1541
01:39:43,790 --> 01:39:44,630
20th zone!

1542
01:39:46,050 --> 01:39:46,610
20th zone?

1543
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:50,650
It's the own 20, it's the own 20.

1544
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:53,870
Keyword!

1545
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:55,130
Nagoya!

1546
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:11,670
What just happened?

1547
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:12,770
Why am I back here?

1548
01:40:14,510 --> 01:40:16,290
Why am I...

1549
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:19,110
Why am I...

1550
01:40:19,110 --> 01:40:19,350
Why am I back?

1551
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:20,630
Why am I...

1552
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:21,810
Why am I back here?

1553
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:27,670
Was I not supposed...

1554
01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:29,630
Was I supposed to ignore that door?

1555
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:34,900
Keyword!

1556
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:36,640
And the...

1557
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,620
I didn't know this was a Metal Gear game.

1558
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:46,520
I threw my bomb too late.

1559
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:50,620
Wait, wait.

1560
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:56,060
I think you have to go backwards on 20th.

1561
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:59,880
If we make it, if we make it there again, we'll try.

1562
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:06,900
Though, I'll be honest.

1563
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:18,640
Even if I get to level 100, um through this method i think
i'll keep i i don't know it feels too easy right like i've

1564
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:29,420
only been playing for two hours less than two hours so i do
want to try maybe the other method the 11 to 50 to oh oops i

1565
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:40,080
forgot where i was at to to i don't know is there anyone who
has played this game levels Levels one.

1566
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:42,300
Oh my gosh.

1567
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:42,720
Ugh.

1568
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:44,380
Okay, nice, nice, nice, nice.

1569
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:44,820
Shoo-shaw.

1570
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:48,040
Levels like in complete order, I wonder.

1571
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:49,240
Oof.

1572
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:50,260
Okay, nice.

1573
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:50,940
Shoo.

1574
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:03,800
Oh, wait.

1575
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:04,880
Can I go back?

1576
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:05,660
Can I like...

1577
01:42:08,770 --> 01:42:09,030
No.

1578
01:42:23,490 --> 01:42:24,530
Oh my god!

1579
01:42:24,950 --> 01:42:25,670
No way.

1580
01:42:26,370 --> 01:42:26,970
No!

1581
01:42:27,910 --> 01:42:29,110
No way!

1582
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:31,210
And it reset the counter!

1583
01:42:31,730 --> 01:42:32,190
Yo!

1584
01:42:33,310 --> 01:42:34,790
Oh my god.

1585
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:37,330
Are you kidding me right now?

1586
01:42:40,970 --> 01:42:42,310
That's incredible.

1587
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:43,750
Best game ever.

1588
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:51,860
Do I bomb them?

1589
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:53,700
Keyword Nagoya.

1590
01:42:57,560 --> 01:42:58,520
Oh.

1591
01:42:59,180 --> 01:43:00,960
Wait, I can jump on these guys.

1592
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:02,360
No, no, no, no.

1593
01:43:06,610 --> 01:43:06,730
Oh.

1594
01:43:09,030 --> 01:43:09,990
Uh.

1595
01:43:11,110 --> 01:43:12,070
Uh.

1596
01:43:14,010 --> 01:43:14,810
Nagoya.

1597
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:16,890
Nagoya.

1598
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:18,830
Nagoya.

1599
01:43:18,930 --> 01:43:20,230
Nagoya.

1600
01:43:20,590 --> 01:43:22,830
Keyword Nagoya.

1601
01:43:23,630 --> 01:43:23,810
Nagoya.

1602
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:30,770
I'm afraid to jump.

1603
01:43:52,490 --> 01:44:00,930
It sounds like a classical song that like someone made when
they were when they had like scarlet fever or something like

1604
01:44:00,930 --> 01:44:03,490
I have the black plague my mind is going.

1605
01:44:06,630 --> 01:44:08,950
Why didn't it stop him?

1606
01:44:09,230 --> 01:44:09,750
The bomb.

1607
01:44:11,170 --> 01:44:12,410
Why didn't it stop him?

1608
01:44:15,990 --> 01:44:18,430
Maybe you have to jump on their heads in a certain order.

1609
01:44:20,350 --> 01:44:20,890
No idea.

1610
01:44:21,710 --> 01:44:23,370
It might be time to give up on this route.

1611
01:44:24,730 --> 01:44:25,730
If there was, like, no way.

1612
01:44:25,890 --> 01:44:27,190
How do you do it, though?

1613
01:44:31,110 --> 01:44:34,650
Do I have to blow them up, maybe, like, in a special way?

1614
01:44:35,630 --> 01:44:36,790
I'm just not sure.

1615
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:43,310
So this must be endless aid everyone here's talking about.

1616
01:44:49,590 --> 01:44:50,450
Let's see.

1617
01:44:51,330 --> 01:44:51,770
Hello.

1618
01:44:53,490 --> 01:44:54,390
Oh, please.

1619
01:44:56,330 --> 01:44:58,750
Uh-oh, we've wasted a lot of time.

1620
01:44:59,830 --> 01:45:01,610
A lot of time.

1621
01:45:02,410 --> 01:45:07,590
I don't even know if I'll make it to level 10.

1622
01:45:07,970 --> 01:45:09,350
Oh, how did I do that?

1623
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:14,830
I don't even know if I'll make it to level 10.

1624
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:16,330
Oh, shoot.

1625
01:45:18,430 --> 01:45:20,450
But if I do, I can just go back.

1626
01:45:34,050 --> 01:45:38,150
If you're still at this at six hours, we'll tell you how the
Naglia room works.

1627
01:45:39,650 --> 01:45:40,610
You're too kind.

1628
01:45:42,230 --> 01:45:43,170
You're too kind.

1629
01:45:44,730 --> 01:45:47,710
Kato Arino also has mint clothes.

1630
01:45:51,210 --> 01:45:51,790
Oh, look at that.

1631
01:45:51,870 --> 01:45:52,790
It's closed now.

1632
01:45:53,090 --> 01:45:53,710
Isn't that kind of funny?

1633
01:45:56,230 --> 01:45:57,250
But also, you're right.

1634
01:45:58,290 --> 01:45:59,810
Arino does have...

1635
01:45:59,910 --> 01:46:02,290
It does have mint clothes.

1636
01:46:05,770 --> 01:46:07,610
The Nagoya room is actually unsolvable.

1637
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:11,050
What do you mean?

1638
01:46:11,450 --> 01:46:12,370
What do you mean by that?

1639
01:46:12,730 --> 01:46:15,470
And also, like, if I practice here...

1640
01:46:15,470 --> 01:46:16,910
Yeah, so you like...

1641
01:46:19,110 --> 01:46:21,830
But it's in the guide that you can go from...

1642
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:23,910
From 20 to...

1643
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:30,300
It's solvable?

1644
01:46:34,290 --> 01:46:35,510
Do I have to, like, get it in their mind?

1645
01:46:35,530 --> 01:46:36,010
mouths.

1646
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:46,500
It's a secret code.

1647
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:52,960
Na...

1648
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:54,820
Go...

1649
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:57,760
Yeah.

1650
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:02,240
Something to do with the plants.

1651
01:47:07,290 --> 01:47:11,270
I think this is my last life anyway, so it's probably fine
to...

1652
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:12,430
You were in Nagoya.

1653
01:47:14,430 --> 01:47:14,910
Yeah.

1654
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:33,380
Oh!

1655
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:39,020
Oh!

1656
01:47:39,020 --> 01:47:40,640
I wasn't my last one.

1657
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:50,110
Nah!

1658
01:47:50,510 --> 01:47:50,990
Seven.

1659
01:47:51,350 --> 01:47:52,110
So seven there.

1660
01:47:52,370 --> 01:47:52,590
Go!

1661
01:47:52,750 --> 01:47:54,170
One, two, three, four, five.

1662
01:47:55,190 --> 01:47:55,610
Yeah!

1663
01:47:56,710 --> 01:47:57,190
Eight?

1664
01:47:57,890 --> 01:47:58,550
I don't know.

1665
01:47:58,890 --> 01:47:59,470
Actually, uh...

1666
01:48:00,590 --> 01:48:03,030
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1667
01:48:07,230 --> 01:48:09,330
Do I have to like get it on top of their heads?

1668
01:48:13,630 --> 01:48:15,110
Like if I...

1669
01:48:17,230 --> 01:48:22,190
Do I have to like blow up like seven on top of their heads?

1670
01:48:25,790 --> 01:48:26,150
See,

1671
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:30,700
see, see, see?

1672
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:34,680
Oh my god, that's like so hard.

1673
01:48:35,020 --> 01:48:37,180
That's actually so hard.

1674
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:39,220
Ah, so tricky!

1675
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:41,860
Ah, so close!

1676
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:44,880
Ah, I think I...

1677
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,460
Oh, dang.

1678
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:58,160
It's like pixel perfect.

1679
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:04,380
Drop it by crouching?

1680
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:09,960
What if I...

1681
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:13,180
Oh, no.

1682
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:16,880
It doesn't need one, two...

1683
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:18,920
How do I even know if it's working?

1684
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:26,140
Three, four, five, six, seven.

1685
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:32,790
Either of you go on top and drop them.

1686
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:39,640
It still doesn't work.

1687
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:40,740
Wait, maybe like this.

1688
01:49:45,790 --> 01:49:46,590
Come on.

1689
01:49:47,950 --> 01:49:49,710
Okay, I think I give up on this method.

1690
01:49:51,350 --> 01:49:53,410
I think I give up on this method.

1691
01:49:54,650 --> 01:49:56,490
All right, let's go back to the drawing board, everybody.

1692
01:49:57,550 --> 01:49:59,930
Let's go back to the drawing board.

1693
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:09,020
Where did I put my window?

1694
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:10,180
Uh-oh.

1695
01:50:10,340 --> 01:50:11,060
Oh, there it is.

1696
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:12,820
Wait, I lost it.

1697
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:14,360
There it is.

1698
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:14,580
Okay.

1699
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:16,600
Um.

1700
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:20,240
I think we gotta try the 1 to 11.

1701
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:21,180
52.

1702
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:26,740
Okay, when we get to 52, where is the door?

1703
01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:38,850
Hmm.

1704
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:46,150
Wow, Atlantis is truly a...

1705
01:50:46,770 --> 01:50:48,410
It's truly...

1706
01:50:48,410 --> 01:50:49,430
Oh my god.

1707
01:50:50,270 --> 01:50:52,150
Truly a mysterious place.

1708
01:50:54,970 --> 01:50:57,470
That was so close.

1709
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:00,810
Very naso indeed.

1710
01:51:11,390 --> 01:51:15,910
Oh, I'm just gonna jump over you guys.

1711
01:51:25,370 --> 01:51:27,930
Yeah, I'm still not raging.

1712
01:51:28,310 --> 01:51:29,190
I think I'm still okay.

1713
01:51:33,530 --> 01:51:34,030
Nice.

1714
01:51:34,990 --> 01:51:36,550
Has it honestly been a month already?

1715
01:51:36,830 --> 01:51:37,670
That's crazy.

1716
01:51:39,090 --> 01:51:39,970
Here I am.

1717
01:51:41,370 --> 01:51:42,510
Not raging.

1718
01:51:45,870 --> 01:51:46,590
Oh my god.

1719
01:51:47,010 --> 01:51:47,410
Oh my god.

1720
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:48,030
Oh my god.

1721
01:51:53,090 --> 01:51:54,210
Okay, 11th zone.

1722
01:51:54,550 --> 01:51:56,170
I don't remember what this zone was like.

1723
01:51:58,390 --> 01:51:59,390
Oh, yes, I do remember.

1724
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:00,830
I have to blow myself up here.

1725
01:52:01,190 --> 01:52:02,210
Let's get some treasure, though.

1726
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:03,590
Very nice.

1727
01:52:04,590 --> 01:52:05,970
I have to blow myself up here.

1728
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:09,130
Then we go to the 52nd zone.

1729
01:52:09,830 --> 01:52:10,230
52nd.

1730
01:52:13,070 --> 01:52:15,410
Oh, I do remember this zone.

1731
01:52:20,050 --> 01:52:20,650
Locusts.

1732
01:52:22,350 --> 01:52:22,950
Locusts.

1733
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:28,520
Please, please, leave me alone!

1734
01:52:30,640 --> 01:52:31,200
Oh, okay.

1735
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:32,660
Nice.

1736
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:37,400
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1737
01:52:38,860 --> 01:52:39,460
Please!

1738
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:53,380
Okay, just keep going.

1739
01:53:04,690 --> 01:53:06,230
Please throw a bomb!

1740
01:53:08,490 --> 01:53:09,290
Okay, okay.

1741
01:53:11,740 --> 01:53:12,140
Nice.

1742
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:13,620
Nice.

1743
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:15,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1744
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:16,360
This is where the...

1745
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:18,140
This is where we're supposed to find the other door.

1746
01:53:18,660 --> 01:53:19,740
The other door to darkness.

1747
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:20,580
Oh gosh.

1748
01:53:23,020 --> 01:53:23,420
Um...

1749
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:24,120
Oh...

1750
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:27,480
Is it on one of these platforms?

1751
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:28,200
Oh, shoot.

1752
01:53:30,660 --> 01:53:31,060
Um...

1753
01:53:33,930 --> 01:53:36,550
Because if we go down here...

1754
01:53:36,550 --> 01:53:37,450
Oh, shoot.

1755
01:53:37,970 --> 01:53:38,210
Oh, shoot.

1756
01:53:38,790 --> 01:53:39,190
Yes.

1757
01:53:39,390 --> 01:53:39,770
Okay, good.

1758
01:53:40,410 --> 01:53:42,270
Maybe like, uh...

1759
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:47,510
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

1760
01:53:49,170 --> 01:53:50,970
No, no, no, I can't go through that one!

1761
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:52,750
Oh my god, please.

1762
01:53:55,430 --> 01:53:57,130
Is it past the other door?

1763
01:53:57,230 --> 01:53:58,870
I don't think so.

1764
01:54:01,150 --> 01:54:04,430
I don't think I can run- I don't think I can jump over that.

1765
01:54:06,490 --> 01:54:06,930
Unless...

1766
01:54:06,930 --> 01:54:07,730
Yeah.

1767
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:15,520
Uh-oh.

1768
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:16,960
I can't go back.

1769
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:21,120
I'm stuck here.

1770
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:23,540
I can't go back.

1771
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:26,140
I can't go back.

1772
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:37,450
Shoot.

1773
01:54:39,050 --> 01:54:39,150
Oh.

1774
01:54:40,090 --> 01:54:40,450
Okay.

1775
01:54:41,030 --> 01:54:42,050
And we're stuck here too.

1776
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:43,730
Now we're stuck here.

1777
01:54:47,870 --> 01:54:48,450
Okay.

1778
01:54:48,830 --> 01:54:49,610
That's fine.

1779
01:54:49,850 --> 01:54:52,850
It doesn't take much to get to the next level, so...

1780
01:54:53,830 --> 01:54:56,550
Or to get to from 11 to 50, whatever?

1781
01:54:57,050 --> 01:54:57,790
50, 54?

1782
01:54:58,530 --> 01:54:59,630
So I think we'll be okay.

1783
01:55:02,730 --> 01:55:04,310
How does Mint know all of that?

1784
01:55:04,730 --> 01:55:05,230
All of what?

1785
01:55:06,270 --> 01:55:07,010
What do I know?

1786
01:55:07,510 --> 01:55:08,330
I don't know anything.

1787
01:55:09,970 --> 01:55:11,290
I don't know anything.

1788
01:55:12,790 --> 01:55:13,270
52.

1789
01:55:14,170 --> 01:55:15,270
Thank you.

1790
01:55:16,670 --> 01:55:17,190
Nine.

1791
01:55:17,330 --> 01:55:17,790
Thank you.

1792
01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:19,770
I always love retro gameplay.

1797
01:56:07,490 --> 01:56:09,350
If I were a hidden door.

1798
01:56:13,010 --> 01:56:13,570
Where?

1799
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:18,430
Where would I be?

1800
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:22,730
Oh, that was so close.

1801
01:56:25,150 --> 01:56:25,630
Gosher!

1802
01:56:26,210 --> 01:56:27,530
Thank you so much for the 50 gift!

1803
01:56:27,690 --> 01:56:28,330
Thank you!

1804
01:56:28,750 --> 01:56:29,850
Also, wait, I'm so sorry.

1805
01:56:29,990 --> 01:56:32,450
Someone also super chatted the pink earlier.

1806
01:56:33,630 --> 01:56:36,510
while listening to your screens and I woke up to a bee in my
hair!

1807
01:56:37,190 --> 01:56:38,730
I like bees but that freaked me out.

1808
01:56:38,850 --> 01:56:40,090
How's this, how's this going?

1809
01:56:40,210 --> 01:56:40,870
Are you winning?

1810
01:56:41,830 --> 01:56:42,270
Schwanky.

1811
01:56:42,910 --> 01:56:44,630
I'm so sorry you had a bee in your hair.

1812
01:56:45,630 --> 01:56:45,910
What?

1813
01:56:48,010 --> 01:56:49,530
That sounds a little frightening.

1814
01:56:56,050 --> 01:56:56,750
She's winning.

1815
01:57:05,870 --> 01:57:07,030
Maybe like right here.

1816
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:14,980
Not there.

1817
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:18,480
Maybe where this treasure box is.

1818
01:57:20,020 --> 01:57:20,820
Shoot.

1819
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:23,540
Never mind.

1820
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:28,920
Do you think I...

1821
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:31,400
Yeah.

1822
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:33,500
Okay, not where the treasure box is.

1823
01:57:34,740 --> 01:57:35,340
Oh my god.

1824
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:37,300
There we go.

1825
01:57:39,380 --> 01:57:40,300
What?

1826
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:42,920
I got that!

1827
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:44,640
Excuse me!

1828
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:46,400
I got that!

1829
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:50,300
I got that!

1830
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:52,140
I got that so...

1831
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:52,600
No.

1832
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:53,480
No!

1833
01:57:54,220 --> 01:57:55,920
This game cheated me.

1834
01:58:08,210 --> 01:58:08,550
Okay.

1835
01:58:09,190 --> 01:58:09,550
Here?

1836
01:58:09,930 --> 01:58:12,410
Oh, I think I tried here before.

1837
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:21,910
Also, if you're trying to say what it is in the chat, please
don't, because I am not asking for answers right now.

1838
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:22,790
You know what?

1839
01:58:22,790 --> 01:58:23,770
Let's just try anywhere.

1840
01:58:26,270 --> 01:58:28,330
I didn't want enough.

1841
01:58:31,630 --> 01:58:33,190
We lost the 50-50.

1842
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:35,110
What's the- what were you betting on?

1843
01:58:35,670 --> 01:58:37,170
What are you betting on, huh?

1844
01:58:39,730 --> 01:58:42,050
It wasn't here.

1845
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:43,130
Oh my goodness.

1846
01:58:46,330 --> 01:58:48,810
Oh my god!

1847
01:58:49,830 --> 01:58:50,510
Oh,

1848
01:58:53,930 --> 01:58:55,010
I jumped too much now.

1849
01:58:55,650 --> 01:58:57,850
Maybe next to the treasure chest.

1850
01:59:08,590 --> 01:59:09,930
You're doing amazing?

1851
01:59:10,490 --> 01:59:11,330
Thank you.

1852
01:59:13,230 --> 01:59:13,870
Please.

1853
01:59:14,230 --> 01:59:17,510
Why can't it be consistent with the enemies, you know?

1854
01:59:18,070 --> 01:59:20,570
All I'm asking for is...

1855
01:59:20,570 --> 01:59:21,430
Oh my god.

1856
01:59:22,590 --> 01:59:25,750
All I'm asking for is a little consistency here.

1857
01:59:26,390 --> 01:59:27,410
Just think about Nagoya.

1858
01:59:28,410 --> 01:59:30,950
Nagoya is the key word to beating this game.

1859
01:59:32,970 --> 01:59:33,610
Oh!

1860
01:59:34,110 --> 01:59:36,890
Oh my god, I took out two bugs with one bomb!

1861
01:59:38,510 --> 01:59:39,490
You know what they say?

1862
01:59:40,030 --> 01:59:41,350
Two bugs with one bomb.

1863
01:59:43,010 --> 01:59:45,270
Wait, I lost the timer again.

1864
01:59:48,350 --> 01:59:48,810
Yeah.

1865
01:59:50,530 --> 01:59:51,970
Take my wrath.

1866
01:59:52,830 --> 01:59:53,910
Take my...

1867
01:59:54,470 --> 01:59:55,050
Fury!

1868
01:59:57,110 --> 02:00:02,130
I got bugged.

1869
02:00:03,550 --> 02:00:04,210
No,

1870
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:09,900
please.

1871
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:12,340
Please stop coming for me.

1872
02:00:20,410 --> 02:00:21,450
I can't.

1873
02:00:22,230 --> 02:00:23,070
Is that a game over?

1874
02:00:23,170 --> 02:00:25,650
Now I

1875
02:00:36,620 --> 02:00:37,380
won't feel so bad.

1876
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:39,880
Oh, I dropped a bomb instead of jumping, my bad.

1877
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:42,560
Now I won't feel so bad if we get all the way to...

1878
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:45,680
to, um...

1879
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:49,980
the final levels because it's already been a challenge
enough getting...

1880
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:50,700
getting there.

1881
02:00:58,120 --> 02:01:00,580
And we're gonna...

1882
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:04,900
You're totally bugged.

1883
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:06,380
No.

1884
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:08,840
This game is genuinely about the journey.

1885
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:11,920
It's about something.

1886
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:16,120
We're just a little guy trying to find Atlantis.

1887
02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:18,200
Actually, are we in Atlantis?

1888
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:21,120
Or are we going to Atlantis?

1889
02:01:22,620 --> 02:01:24,540
I'm kind of confused about that part.

1890
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:38,960
Because like if we found Atlantis and we're here In Atlantis
But like What's the mystery Why it's built like this?

1891
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:48,280
No wonder everybody died in Atlantis Look how your society
is built Look how your society is built Okay here we go

1892
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:57,200
We're back baby Bug He's just so so slowly grazes my head.

1893
02:01:58,560 --> 02:01:59,660
It's so funny.

1894
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:01,040
It's not funny at all.

1895
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:03,140
It's so frustrating.

1896
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:04,660
Okay, there we go.

1897
02:02:06,060 --> 02:02:09,460
And then if I hadn't made that jump, that would have been so
sad.

1898
02:02:09,660 --> 02:02:15,420
I can't throw another bomb until the one explodes, which
also just really messes me up.

1899
02:02:15,700 --> 02:02:17,520
It really grinds my gears.

1900
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:20,040
Yes.

1901
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:21,960
Okay.

1902
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:27,520
No, no, no, no.

1903
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:28,740
Oh my god.

1904
02:02:29,380 --> 02:02:29,840
Oh my god.

1905
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:33,380
Nice.

1906
02:02:34,540 --> 02:02:35,760
Okay, here, here, maybe.

1907
02:02:38,860 --> 02:02:39,200
Wow!

1908
02:02:40,620 --> 02:02:41,000
Yes!

1909
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:43,900
That was what I was hoping for.

1910
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:46,180
Throw!

1911
02:02:49,060 --> 02:02:50,920
Is it next to the other door?

1912
02:02:52,180 --> 02:02:53,820
They wouldn't do that, would they?

1913
02:02:56,020 --> 02:02:56,380
Uh-oh.

1914
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:57,120
Uh-oh.

1915
02:02:57,640 --> 02:02:58,860
There we go.

1916
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:03,560
It's not next to the other door, is it?

1917
02:03:20,630 --> 02:03:22,250
I have to, like, throw it, so...

1918
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:22,370
Oh.

1919
02:03:23,050 --> 02:03:24,030
Okay, it's not.

1920
02:03:24,670 --> 02:03:27,190
Maybe if I throw it from here, maybe that's the key.

1921
02:03:27,510 --> 02:03:27,670
No.

1922
02:03:27,950 --> 02:03:28,230
Okay.

1923
02:03:29,030 --> 02:03:31,110
They're not trying to give me hints at all.

1924
02:03:34,410 --> 02:03:34,930
Bug!

1925
02:03:37,090 --> 02:03:38,950
But sometimes it's also pretty specific.

1926
02:03:43,490 --> 02:03:44,870
What did I throw it from here?

1927
02:03:44,890 --> 02:03:45,950
Oh, there, there, there, there.

1928
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:46,510
Oh, no.

1929
02:03:47,270 --> 02:03:47,310
Aha!

1930
02:03:48,410 --> 02:03:49,210
Time out!

1931
02:03:50,150 --> 02:03:50,730
It's okay.

1932
02:03:50,830 --> 02:03:52,690
We're gonna have to do a lot of trial and error for this.

1933
02:03:52,990 --> 02:03:56,510
So, honestly, it's best that we time out than getting
bugged.

1934
02:03:58,410 --> 02:03:59,890
At least I...

1935
02:04:00,670 --> 02:04:01,410
Look at him.

1936
02:04:01,690 --> 02:04:02,530
What an idiot.

1937
02:04:02,610 --> 02:04:03,590
Now he's gonna drown!

1938
02:04:04,350 --> 02:04:06,490
Oh, you don't drown, but I can.

1939
02:04:07,450 --> 02:04:08,590
Okay, this is fine.

1940
02:04:10,770 --> 02:04:11,690
This is fine.

1941
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:14,710
Okay, where...

1942
02:04:14,710 --> 02:04:14,870
Oh.

1943
02:04:14,890 --> 02:04:16,250
Could it be?

1944
02:04:17,650 --> 02:04:21,070
Oh wait, oh my god.

1945
02:04:23,450 --> 02:04:26,550
Maybe like I stand here and throw it.

1946
02:04:27,490 --> 02:04:27,750
You know?

1947
02:04:28,270 --> 02:04:30,930
Maybe the opening is like a little...

1948
02:04:33,970 --> 02:04:34,710
Oh shoot.

1949
02:04:42,090 --> 02:04:44,690
He's built it for 50 seconds.

1950
02:04:47,150 --> 02:04:48,450
Okay, it's not there.

1951
02:04:50,090 --> 02:04:54,270
No, is it, did I try next to the treasure box?

1952
02:04:55,170 --> 02:04:57,070
I don't think I, there we go, nice.

1953
02:04:59,510 --> 02:05:01,530
I don't think I have, maybe if I aim from here.

1954
02:05:04,690 --> 02:05:05,070
Aim.

1955
02:05:06,810 --> 02:05:07,590
Okay, I give up.

1956
02:05:08,590 --> 02:05:09,410
I don't know.

1957
02:05:10,190 --> 02:05:11,570
Can you get exploded by your own bombs?

1958
02:05:11,710 --> 02:05:12,310
You can.

1959
02:05:13,050 --> 02:05:14,070
You actually can.

1960
02:05:17,970 --> 02:05:19,810
Okay, actually, what if I do this instead?

1961
02:05:21,030 --> 02:05:21,290
No.

1962
02:05:22,870 --> 02:05:25,550
Why do you throw it so much, you dummy?

1963
02:05:27,150 --> 02:05:28,770
I'm gonna run out of time again.

1964
02:05:29,430 --> 02:05:30,350
Okay, I want a hint.

1965
02:05:31,150 --> 02:05:31,710
Do you want a hint?

1966
02:05:31,810 --> 02:05:32,330
Yeah, just a hint.

1967
02:05:32,530 --> 02:05:33,070
Don't tell me where.

1968
02:05:33,170 --> 02:05:33,650
Don't tell me where.

1969
02:05:33,810 --> 02:05:34,290
But just a hint.

1970
02:05:34,710 --> 02:05:35,690
Like, check.

1971
02:05:36,650 --> 02:05:37,050
Check.

1972
02:05:37,730 --> 02:05:39,430
Where the pillar meets three.

1973
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:42,550
One mondiata!

1974
02:05:43,290 --> 02:05:44,090
Thank you.

1975
02:05:46,290 --> 02:05:48,090
Hint of the last platform.

1976
02:05:51,070 --> 02:05:51,470
Like...

1977
02:05:52,830 --> 02:05:56,170
Where the like right before the door or where the door is

1978
02:06:01,090 --> 02:06:03,090
The last platform

1979
02:06:12,350 --> 02:06:23,110
So this platform It's under there under where only one hint
last platform.

1980
02:06:23,570 --> 02:06:35,460
Okay, okay, okay, okay So wait if I I wanted to jump and
then throw it on back onto the other platform.

1981
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:36,360
Oh man.

1982
02:06:51,230 --> 02:06:51,750
Mommy?

1983
02:06:52,050 --> 02:06:52,250
Sorry.

1984

Sorry.

1992
02:06:58,050 --> 02:06:58,210
Mommy?

1993
02:07:07,790 --> 02:07:10,890
While we run out of lives, I'm gonna go to the bathroom real
quick.

1994
02:07:11,270 --> 02:07:12,470
I'm gonna go to the little ghosty's room.

1995

No!

1999
02:09:34,710 --> 02:09:35,750
Game over!

2000
02:09:35,850 --> 02:09:36,790
Perfect timing, right?

2001
02:09:37,090 --> 02:09:40,810
Okay, I'm gonna look back at the guide one more time.

2002
02:09:42,950 --> 02:09:47,470
Is there something we missed about what it says for the
route?

2003
02:09:48,950 --> 02:09:50,350
Can I zoom in a little bit more?

2004
02:09:51,170 --> 02:09:52,570
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2005
02:09:52,830 --> 02:09:54,290
Saitan route.

2006
02:09:56,090 --> 02:09:57,290
That's Saitan.

2007
02:09:57,970 --> 02:09:58,870
Saitan.

2008
02:09:59,270 --> 02:10:00,190
Muteki route.

2009
02:10:02,350 --> 02:10:03,790
High score route.

2010
02:10:04,430 --> 02:10:04,430
Wow.

2011
02:10:05,930 --> 02:10:11,270
What kind of masochist do you have to be to go for a high
score in this game?

2012
02:10:20,040 --> 02:10:22,140
Zen item route.

2013
02:10:22,580 --> 02:10:23,660
Oh no way.

2014
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:25,420
No thank you.

2015
02:10:29,780 --> 02:10:30,340
scoreblades.

2016
02:10:31,660 --> 02:10:34,180
If I'm not top 50, why even play?

2017
02:10:35,220 --> 02:10:40,120
I'm afraid of anyone that is that holds a record in this
game.

2018
02:10:41,340 --> 02:10:44,420
I'm terrified of anybody that holds a record in this game.

2019
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:45,040
Hold on.

2020
02:10:45,940 --> 02:10:48,940
I'm bank your time.

2021
02:10:52,860 --> 02:10:53,360
Oh, okay.

2022
02:10:53,580 --> 02:10:54,520
Saitan is just the shortest.

2023
02:10:54,860 --> 02:10:57,200
Okay, that's why I figured, but...

2024
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:57,320
Hmm.

2025
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:01,720
But

2026
02:11:12,690 --> 02:11:13,190
then...

2027
02:11:13,190 --> 02:11:14,510
What's the red route?

2028
02:11:16,950 --> 02:11:18,370
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2029
02:11:19,290 --> 02:11:22,610
One, two, three, eight, ten.

2030
02:11:24,270 --> 02:11:24,770
Four.

2031
02:11:25,750 --> 02:11:27,130
Have we done four before?

2032
02:11:27,210 --> 02:11:27,870
What is this?

2033
02:11:28,010 --> 02:11:28,570
The star?

2034
02:11:29,230 --> 02:11:30,990
Okay, you get a bunch of items.

2035
02:11:31,150 --> 02:11:32,070
Oh, oh no!

2036
02:11:33,530 --> 02:11:34,510
What page were we on?

2037
02:11:35,890 --> 02:11:36,390
Uh...

2038
02:11:36,990 --> 02:11:38,350
Uh-oh, I lost my page.

2039
02:11:40,050 --> 02:11:42,050
Oh, there we go.

2040
02:11:42,490 --> 02:11:43,130
Um, 25.

2041
02:11:43,870 --> 02:11:46,830
So it's the shortest, but it says it's an invincible route.

2042
02:11:48,930 --> 02:11:49,690
But 10!

2043
02:11:50,710 --> 02:11:52,510
We have to go through 10!

2044
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:01,380
Okay, it says from 97 to 100.

2045
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:04,980
The shoes are...

2046
02:12:04,980 --> 02:12:06,400
You have to have the shoes.

2047
02:12:12,970 --> 02:12:13,650
Okay.

2048
02:12:15,290 --> 02:12:23,590
interesting so from 97 to 100 you have to have the shoes for
this route but this one bypasses the one that we're doing

2049
02:12:23,590 --> 02:12:35,370
the the this one bypasses actually how many how many stages
are in this red route versus the orange route let's see can

2050
02:12:35,370 --> 02:12:45,630
we get a coffee meter i've only have one can i only everyone
can so the shoes you say the shoes here like you get six so

2051
02:12:45,630 --> 02:13:00,290
this is one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve okay one two three four five six seven eight

2052
02:13:00,290 --> 02:13:10,090
nine ten did i count 100 on the first one i don't remember
12 in the red route so it's not even that big Okay, so we

2053
02:13:10,090 --> 02:13:12,890
have our two routes, I think we should- we would have to go,
why?

2054
02:13:16,330 --> 02:13:19,510
But I'm- this one is called the invincibility route.

2055
02:13:19,650 --> 02:13:20,750
So what does that even mean?

2056
02:13:21,030 --> 02:13:22,710
I have to beat level 10 though!

2057
02:13:24,810 --> 02:13:25,690
Oh god.

2058
02:13:28,290 --> 02:13:29,070
Oh god.

2059
02:13:31,130 --> 02:13:32,010
Oh god.

2060
02:13:34,310 --> 02:13:37,170
And then this thing that I need the shoes worries me.

2061
02:13:37,390 --> 02:13:39,450
What's going on in 97 that I need the shoes?

2062
02:13:39,470 --> 02:13:39,790
huh?

2063
02:13:44,170 --> 02:13:45,370
Try Nagoya route again.

2064
02:13:48,090 --> 02:13:49,310
What does it say for that one?

2065
02:13:50,490 --> 02:13:51,210
Ah, sorry.

2066
02:13:52,710 --> 02:13:54,350
It's the blue route.

2067
02:13:54,770 --> 02:13:56,330
That's the high score route.

2068
02:13:57,130 --> 02:14:00,910
How does that even make any sense if you go from 8 to 20 to
100?

2069
02:14:02,870 --> 02:14:05,190
I guess you get the 400 points.

2070
02:14:06,270 --> 02:14:06,590
Oh, no.

2071
02:14:06,950 --> 02:14:07,310
400.

2072
02:14:07,770 --> 02:14:08,270
Oh, my God.

2073
02:14:09,530 --> 02:14:21,110
400 400 Oh my god You get a lot of points actually You get a
ton of bajillion points Hmm Real question is how long is the

2074
02:14:21,110 --> 02:14:25,410
longest route you can take I guess in regular order right

2075
02:14:42,990 --> 02:15:01,290
I think Okay I'll try and get the uh the we'll try for 52
again I wonder what this little thing is uh we'll try for 52

2076
02:15:01,290 --> 02:15:04,890
again and then um

2077
02:15:10,910 --> 02:15:21,440
I'll try and find it I'll try and find it okay okay Okay,
all right.

2078
02:15:24,010 --> 02:15:25,090
Ike-mashou.

2079
02:15:27,310 --> 02:15:29,270
Where's my...

2080
02:15:29,270 --> 02:15:29,670
Okay.

2081
02:15:32,410 --> 02:15:33,050
Okay.

2082
02:15:34,650 --> 02:15:37,110
Dark blue line looks really long.

2083
02:15:38,750 --> 02:15:39,130
Wow.

2084
02:15:41,950 --> 02:15:45,810
Let's go try and find us a hidden passage.

2085
02:15:49,030 --> 02:15:50,010
Beep.

2086
02:15:50,030 --> 02:15:50,250
Beep.

2087
02:15:50,270 --> 02:15:53,770
You guys said the hit was the last platform.

2088
02:16:11,590 --> 02:16:13,750
We can give another hit when you're ready.

2089
02:16:14,090 --> 02:16:14,630
No, it's okay.

2090
02:16:16,790 --> 02:16:19,050
It's okay, it's okay.

2091
02:16:19,670 --> 02:16:20,210
Explosion!

2092
02:16:24,550 --> 02:16:25,970
Do you eventually loop around?

2093
02:16:25,990 --> 02:16:43,950
to loving this song love is a strong word I think just as
hate hate and love are two sides of the same coin right

2094
02:16:43,950 --> 02:16:52,430
right I know

2095
02:17:02,630 --> 02:17:14,120
I get pretty close to them but It's the only way I can
assure true and total death.

2096
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:18,580
True and total death.

2097
02:17:21,020 --> 02:17:21,620
Okay.

2098
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:23,540
If I just drop here.

2099
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:24,360
All right.

2100
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:28,640
No.

2101
02:17:31,260 --> 02:17:32,680
Oh no no no no no no.

2102
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:35,280
That's okay.

2103
02:17:35,520 --> 02:17:36,740
We still have seven lives left.

2104
02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:40,140
Are you winning, Minto?

2105
02:17:42,140 --> 02:17:43,440
We're making problems.

2106
02:17:43,460 --> 02:17:57,460
progress somehow we are making progress there's there's some
progress being made i mean we're level 54 you guys oh we're

2107
02:17:57,460 --> 02:18:09,460
level we're in the 50s oh my gosh oh oh that was so close
that's what you get for getting too close to me

2108
02:18:23,910 --> 02:18:29,750
50 seconds How did you find out about this game originally?

2109
02:18:30,870 --> 02:18:47,850
I originally watched the Game Center CX But also I watched
Korone play it And so I was Oh wrong button Oh my gosh so

2110
02:18:47,850 --> 02:18:53,510
dangerous Here So that's what got me interested in playing
it.

2111
02:18:55,970 --> 02:18:56,330
Oh.

2112
02:18:58,610 --> 02:19:00,210
What is Game Center CX?

2113
02:19:00,390 --> 02:19:01,690
Oh my gosh, it's so awesome.

2114
02:19:02,610 --> 02:19:13,230
Game Center CX is like a show where this guy just tries a
bunch of games and like he has like some rage challenges as

2115
02:19:13,230 --> 02:19:13,430
well.

2116
02:19:13,630 --> 02:19:19,330
Like he played Takashi's castle and everything and oh my
god, I'm going to die!

2117
02:19:19,510 --> 02:19:19,950
The bug!

2118
02:19:22,790 --> 02:19:24,350
Japanese Oji-san Gamer Show.

2119
02:19:24,490 --> 02:19:25,370
It's really funny.

2120
02:19:26,450 --> 02:19:27,590
We love Arino Kachon.

2121
02:19:28,950 --> 02:19:29,910
It's really funny.

2122
02:19:30,350 --> 02:19:30,370
Oh.

2123
02:19:31,930 --> 02:19:33,290
Why do I have a flu?

2124
02:19:33,870 --> 02:19:34,830
I went flying.

2125
02:19:43,010 --> 02:19:43,190
Okay.

2126
02:19:43,910 --> 02:19:45,570
I like when there's only one bug there.

2127
02:19:46,130 --> 02:19:48,130
Makes things a little bit easier.

2128
02:19:51,810 --> 02:19:54,690
I'm afraid of the other route just because of...

2129
02:19:54,970 --> 02:19:58,790
Oh my gosh, I thought I was gonna die there, because I'd
have to go through level eight and 10.

2130
02:19:59,730 --> 02:20:08,570
But if that's what we gotta do, a baby's gotta do what a
baby's gotta do.

2131
02:20:09,570 --> 02:20:12,790
I can't even get to the end of the last platform anymore,
man.

2132
02:20:27,750 --> 02:20:29,670
Oh, that was so close.

2133
02:20:30,350 --> 02:20:31,050
Oh, okay.

2134
02:20:31,290 --> 02:20:31,630
Never mind.

2135
02:20:38,260 --> 02:20:39,160
No, no.

2136
02:20:44,210 --> 02:20:45,470
Okay, last platform.

2137
02:20:46,370 --> 02:20:48,450
I'm just gonna blow up everywhere that I can.

2138
02:20:48,690 --> 02:20:50,050
Oh, uh oh.

2139
02:20:50,470 --> 02:20:53,410
Oh, I got one guy at least.

2140
02:20:54,690 --> 02:20:54,890
Please.

2141
02:20:56,550 --> 02:20:57,310
There we go.

2142
02:20:57,910 --> 02:20:58,830
Last platform.

2143
02:20:59,150 --> 02:20:59,890
Oh, this is this.

2144
02:21:03,970 --> 02:21:04,530
Oh.

2145
02:21:27,550 --> 02:21:29,430
Maybe the hole in the fence is a hint.

2146
02:21:29,590 --> 02:21:31,050
I've tried it, though.

2147
02:21:32,070 --> 02:21:32,950
I tried it.

2148
02:21:33,070 --> 02:21:34,390
I'm going to run out of time with this ray.

2149
02:21:36,150 --> 02:21:39,250
Like, I thought maybe shooting in there.

2150
02:21:39,850 --> 02:21:40,290
Oh, nice.

2151
02:21:42,590 --> 02:21:44,350
But it doesn't do anything.

2152
02:21:45,810 --> 02:21:46,170
No.

2153
02:21:50,730 --> 02:21:52,650
Maybe if I shoot from here, no.

2154
02:21:54,270 --> 02:21:55,250
Jump and shoot.

2155
02:22:00,330 --> 02:22:01,750
Go away, bug.

2156
02:22:02,830 --> 02:22:04,050
You're bugging me.

2157
02:22:04,210 --> 02:22:04,750
Oh, I believe it.

2158
02:22:06,350 --> 02:22:07,010
It's okay.

2159
02:22:07,130 --> 02:22:08,130
I was out of time anyway.

2160
02:22:09,350 --> 02:22:10,250
I don't know.

2161
02:22:11,930 --> 02:22:14,650
Yeah, I've blown up every spot of that part.

2162
02:22:15,690 --> 02:22:16,190
Oh my gosh.

2163
02:22:16,350 --> 02:22:17,190
Go away.

2164
02:22:18,390 --> 02:22:19,230
Let's see.

2165
02:22:20,270 --> 02:22:20,790
Hmm.

2166
02:22:32,390 --> 02:22:32,910
No.

2167
02:22:38,360 --> 02:22:39,140
Oh my god.

2168
02:22:39,260 --> 02:22:39,880
I overjumped.

2169
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:49,080
I really want to find that spot though!

2170
02:22:52,280 --> 02:22:54,220
Is this another drop down entrance?

2171
02:22:55,260 --> 02:22:56,080
I don't think so.

2172
02:22:56,240 --> 02:22:56,640
Oh my god.

2173
02:22:58,640 --> 02:22:59,840
Oh my god!

2174
02:23:01,060 --> 02:23:01,700
Whoop!

2175
02:23:06,870 --> 02:23:07,270
Poop!

2176
02:23:10,650 --> 02:23:11,170
Whoa!

2177
02:23:11,650 --> 02:23:13,510
Why are you higher than the last guy?

2178
02:23:15,330 --> 02:23:15,850
Poop.

2179
02:23:17,970 --> 02:23:18,490
Poop.

2180
02:23:22,040 --> 02:23:29,360
Ba-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

2181
02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:29,860
Blow.

2182
02:23:32,750 --> 02:23:33,930
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

2183
02:23:35,310 --> 02:23:37,450
Okay, we're back, baby.

2184
02:23:38,790 --> 02:23:39,730
Why did I...

2185
02:23:43,510 --> 02:23:44,670
No worries.

2186
02:23:45,550 --> 02:23:49,350
I think we got an extra life somehow, so it's like we didn't
even die.

2187
02:23:50,270 --> 02:23:51,090
There we go.

2188
02:23:52,030 --> 02:23:53,290
Oh no!

2189
02:23:58,430 --> 02:24:02,450
Oh my god, now it's two of them!

2190
02:24:03,030 --> 02:24:04,310
Oh shoot.

2191
02:24:05,570 --> 02:24:08,170
Okay, at least got one of them.

2192
02:24:08,310 --> 02:24:08,350
Oh!

2193
02:24:13,620 --> 02:24:14,560
Uh oh.

2194
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:15,620
Die.

2195
02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:16,920
Please die.

2196
02:24:17,740 --> 02:24:20,000
That was really close.

2197
02:24:21,060 --> 02:24:25,800
I almost overcompensated too much on that too.

2198
02:24:26,740 --> 02:24:27,100
Hey!

2199
02:24:30,820 --> 02:24:37,820
And we're back, baby, with our regularly scheduled
programming.

2200
02:24:39,160 --> 02:24:40,020
Last platform.

2201
02:24:41,800 --> 02:24:43,040
Unless it means...

2202
02:24:56,510 --> 02:24:57,010
No!

2203
02:24:57,810 --> 02:24:59,350
It's not there for sure.

2204
02:25:05,460 --> 02:25:07,260
Theory crafting time.

2205
02:25:07,480 --> 02:25:08,380
Atlantis sucks.

2206
02:25:09,660 --> 02:25:10,220
You know what?

2207
02:25:10,440 --> 02:25:11,800
No wonder everybody died here.

2208
02:25:11,980 --> 02:25:12,340
Unless it's...

2209
02:25:12,340 --> 02:25:13,060
Is it like a...

2210
02:25:13,240 --> 02:25:17,720
No, it wouldn't be like, I can't, I can't be above the door
because...

2211
02:25:17,720 --> 02:25:17,960
Oh my god.

2212
02:25:18,180 --> 02:25:18,520
Oh my god.

2213
02:25:19,020 --> 02:25:19,420
Oh my god.

2214
02:25:19,640 --> 02:25:20,300
Oh my god.

2215
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:24,240
That's a great theory.

2216
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:49,900
Okay, can I get a hit number two?

2217
02:25:50,860 --> 02:25:52,400
Can I get a hit number two?

2218
02:25:52,500 --> 02:25:54,200
Have you tried under the bridge?

2219
02:25:55,240 --> 02:25:56,760
Is it actually an under door?

2220
02:25:58,460 --> 02:25:59,180
bad.

2221
02:26:03,150 --> 02:26:04,630
It's not an invisible door.

2222
02:26:05,290 --> 02:26:05,290
What?

2223
02:26:06,890 --> 02:26:08,150
What do you mean by that?

2224
02:26:14,250 --> 02:26:15,370
Under the bridge.

2225
02:26:19,330 --> 02:26:19,850
Oh my god.

2226
02:26:35,320 --> 02:26:37,260
The last platform.

2227
02:26:50,230 --> 02:26:52,250
I don't know if I've fallen here before.

2228
02:26:54,650 --> 02:26:55,750
Have I fallen here?

2229
02:27:00,220 --> 02:27:01,700
Okay, it wasn't that.

2230
02:27:03,460 --> 02:27:05,160
Oh, oh, oh!

2231
02:27:11,800 --> 02:27:12,800
Okay, come here, bugs.

2232
02:27:13,020 --> 02:27:15,280
I need to know how many there are of you.

2233
02:27:16,640 --> 02:27:17,220
Nice!

2234
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:22,240
Sometimes the RNG just works.

2235
02:27:24,020 --> 02:27:27,360
Sometimes the RNG just...

2236
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:30,020
helps out a little bit.

2237
02:27:31,260 --> 02:27:33,060
Maybe at this platform?

2238
02:27:37,590 --> 02:27:37,950
Here?

2239
02:27:38,970 --> 02:27:39,330
Wee!

2240
02:27:43,640 --> 02:27:46,620
I remember watching a dog play this.

2241
02:27:47,060 --> 02:27:47,260
Yeah!

2242
02:27:51,440 --> 02:27:52,720
It's already a month.

2243
02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:53,720
Here's so many more.

2244
02:27:53,880 --> 02:27:54,440
Thank you!

2245
02:27:55,220 --> 02:27:56,460
Thank you, thank you.

2246
02:28:00,620 --> 02:28:01,780
You're getting closer.

2247
02:28:18,140 --> 02:28:18,720
Oh,

2248
02:28:33,610 --> 02:28:35,120
I wasn't sure I was going to make that.

2249
02:28:45,570 --> 02:28:49,170
Maybe it is just safer to duck from those guys.

2250
02:28:51,210 --> 02:28:55,970
Because they're inconsistent as well as like how far apart
they are sometimes.

2251
02:29:01,750 --> 02:29:02,330
Anka!

2252
02:29:03,850 --> 02:29:04,650
They say we're not a duck.

2253
02:29:04,670 --> 02:29:06,190
We're vultures!

2254
02:29:09,250 --> 02:29:12,670
Poop, poop, and throw.

2255
02:29:15,710 --> 02:29:16,890
I don't think they're ducks.

2256
02:29:17,150 --> 02:29:18,030
I don't think they are either.

2257
02:29:18,750 --> 02:29:20,670
I do not think they're ducks at all.

2258
02:29:28,880 --> 02:29:29,920
52nd zone.

2259
02:29:31,100 --> 02:29:31,540
Please.

2260
02:29:32,820 --> 02:29:36,020
I want to see the 54th.

2261
02:29:38,060 --> 02:29:40,400
I think it was 54 after this?

2262
02:29:40,660 --> 02:29:42,880
Oh, I meant to jump before I do that.

2263
02:29:49,100 --> 02:29:50,120
Beep, beep, beep.

2264
02:29:53,140 --> 02:29:54,120
Is it in between?

2265
02:29:56,340 --> 02:29:56,740
No.

2266
02:29:59,940 --> 02:30:01,220
Oh, boy.

2267
02:30:02,700 --> 02:30:03,800
Oh, oh, oh.

2268
02:30:07,420 --> 02:30:09,380
All that just to die anyway.

2269
02:30:13,430 --> 02:30:15,070
Same method as the last level.

2270
02:30:15,750 --> 02:30:17,390
So I blow myself up?

2271
02:30:24,400 --> 02:30:25,140
Are you sure?

2272
02:30:26,420 --> 02:30:31,140
Maybe I blow myself up in the, um...

2273
02:30:31,140 --> 02:30:33,300
Hold on, like in this area.

2274
02:30:38,210 --> 02:30:38,530
Here?

2275
02:30:39,970 --> 02:30:40,610
Blow up!

2276
02:30:40,750 --> 02:30:40,750
Oh!

2277
02:30:47,360 --> 02:30:48,460
Blow up.

2278
02:30:50,860 --> 02:30:51,500
No,

2279
02:30:57,550 --> 02:30:59,270
no, no, not to you!

2280
02:30:59,370 --> 02:30:59,710
I don't want to die!

2281
02:30:59,730 --> 02:31:04,870
to you how

2282
02:31:16,610 --> 02:31:29,570
was someone from the 80s supposed to figure this out back in
the day people actually use guidebooks and like strategy

2283
02:31:29,570 --> 02:31:39,430
things Ike you I don't there were some games that you could
not beat unless you had an actual strategy book to use and

2284
02:31:39,430 --> 02:31:40,970
took notes yeah

2285
02:31:44,430 --> 02:31:45,470
Okay, maybe.

2286
02:31:46,430 --> 02:31:47,250
Oh, maybe.

2287
02:31:49,990 --> 02:31:52,270
But I'm not even, like, dying to my own...

2288
02:31:52,270 --> 02:31:52,450
Oh!

2289
02:31:55,690 --> 02:31:57,250
I take it back.

2290
02:31:57,670 --> 02:31:59,450
I am dying to my own thing.

2291
02:31:59,710 --> 02:32:00,810
Oh, gosh.

2292
02:32:02,750 --> 02:32:03,790
Oh, alright.

2293
02:32:03,870 --> 02:32:04,430
Go down, bug.

2294
02:32:04,650 --> 02:32:05,030
Oh!

2295
02:32:07,450 --> 02:32:07,970
Oh!

2296
02:32:18,290 --> 02:32:19,810
It's a specific spot.

2297
02:32:20,070 --> 02:32:22,710
But before I wasn't even dying to my own bombs.

2298
02:32:23,590 --> 02:32:25,790
So I also have to specifically die.

2299
02:32:27,210 --> 02:32:29,130
I won't know what the spot is.

2300
02:32:29,710 --> 02:32:31,670
Unless I die on the spot.

2301
02:32:32,710 --> 02:32:36,090
Oh, that's the most frustrating part about it.

2302
02:32:38,110 --> 02:32:38,330
Okay.

2303
02:32:50,940 --> 02:32:51,840
Skill issue.

2304
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:53,080
Just die better.

2305
02:32:54,220 --> 02:32:56,380
Why aren't you, why aren't you dying, idiot?

2306
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:03,040
Do you have a game, genie?

2307
02:33:04,360 --> 02:33:06,280
No I never had a game, genie.

2308
02:33:08,420 --> 02:33:08,720
Oops.

2309
02:33:21,960 --> 02:33:24,400
Oh my god, that guy came from the water!

2310
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:28,820
Nasty!

2311
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:31,100
Oh,

2312
02:33:34,310 --> 02:33:35,030
I did it again.

2313
02:33:35,210 --> 02:33:36,170
I did this last time too.

2314
02:33:41,090 --> 02:33:43,450
To be fair, you're so bad at it, you came back twice.

2315
02:33:43,770 --> 02:33:45,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2316
02:33:45,710 --> 02:33:47,950
Let's see your playthrough, Emmanuel.

2317
02:33:48,570 --> 02:33:48,830
Huh?

2318
02:33:50,770 --> 02:33:52,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2319
02:33:54,370 --> 02:33:56,610
It's just finding the door.

2320
02:33:57,490 --> 02:33:57,990
So...

2321
02:33:57,990 --> 02:33:58,210
Oh!

2322
02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:04,960
Oh, tried falling down the hole in the bridge.

2323
02:34:05,900 --> 02:34:07,180
I think I'll just die.

2324
02:34:07,860 --> 02:34:09,820
I don't think I'll go anywhere.

2325
02:34:16,430 --> 02:34:19,450
I think I'll just die.

2326
02:34:20,390 --> 02:34:23,050
Oh my god, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

2327
02:34:23,090 --> 02:34:23,250
Wait.

2328
02:34:25,510 --> 02:34:26,350
There we go.

2329
02:34:30,010 --> 02:34:31,750
So maybe I do die here.

2330
02:34:32,870 --> 02:34:33,550
Okay, hold on.

2331
02:34:34,770 --> 02:34:37,290
Let's try every corner of this bridge.

2332
02:34:55,040 --> 02:34:56,000
Oh no.

2333
02:34:56,720 --> 02:34:57,620
Oh no, no, no, no.

2334
02:34:58,300 --> 02:34:58,800
Oh no.

2335
02:34:59,380 --> 02:35:00,340
Okay, this is a platform.

2336
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:02,180
Oh wow, there's a lot of guys here.

2337
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:04,520
Let's go up and up.

2338
02:35:05,580 --> 02:35:06,040
And up.

2339
02:35:06,140 --> 02:35:06,280
Pshoo!

2340
02:35:08,140 --> 02:35:08,620
Pshoo!

2341
02:35:10,420 --> 02:35:10,900
Pshoo!

2342
02:35:10,900 --> 02:35:11,080
Pshoo!

2343
02:35:12,960 --> 02:35:13,440
Okay.

2344
02:35:14,060 --> 02:35:14,540
Alright.

2345
02:35:16,480 --> 02:35:16,960
Okay.

2346
02:35:17,140 --> 02:35:18,020
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

2347
02:35:19,060 --> 02:35:19,500
Duck.

2348
02:35:20,280 --> 02:35:21,240
Actually, I'm gonna go up.

2349
02:35:22,660 --> 02:35:24,600
Oh, these guys stick to the ceiling!

2350
02:35:25,440 --> 02:35:26,980
Oh no, no, no.

2351
02:35:28,300 --> 02:35:29,000
Oh my god.

2352
02:35:29,240 --> 02:35:30,400
Oh my god, that was so close.

2353
02:35:31,260 --> 02:35:31,900
Oh, door!

2354
02:35:32,240 --> 02:35:33,420
Wait, but is this the door?

2355
02:35:37,180 --> 02:35:37,860
Ninety-thirds!

2356
02:35:38,760 --> 02:35:39,560
Ninety-thirds!

2357
02:35:44,220 --> 02:35:44,760
Uh-oh.

2358
02:35:46,420 --> 02:35:46,980
Uh-oh.

2359
02:35:47,240 --> 02:35:49,940
I think I have to blow myself up here.

2360
02:35:51,440 --> 02:35:52,340
No, I do not.

2361
02:35:52,480 --> 02:35:52,940
Oh my god.

2362
02:35:53,120 --> 02:35:53,580
Oh my god.

2363
02:35:53,740 --> 02:35:53,980
Oh my god.

2364
02:35:54,140 --> 02:35:55,500
I almost ruined it.

2365
02:35:55,540 --> 02:35:56,280
I almost ruined it.

2366
02:36:02,710 --> 02:36:03,110
96th!

2367
02:36:09,530 --> 02:36:09,930
Mommy!

2368
02:36:12,850 --> 02:36:13,230
Mommy!

2369
02:36:23,110 --> 02:36:23,510
Die.

2370
02:36:24,970 --> 02:36:25,450
Oh no, mommy.

2371
02:36:25,610 --> 02:36:26,330
Mommy, mommy, real.

2372
02:36:26,610 --> 02:36:26,850
Mommy, real.

2373
02:36:27,850 --> 02:36:28,210
Mommy, real.

2374
02:36:28,730 --> 02:36:29,170
Mommy, real.

2375
02:36:36,490 --> 02:36:50,390
mommy oh mommy real mommy real mommy real mommy real mommy

2376
02:36:50,390 --> 02:36:52,210

2377
02:36:56,940 --> 02:37:01,420
guys are so cute mommy sorry Mommy, sorry.

2378
02:37:02,400 --> 02:37:02,440
Mommy.

2379
02:37:07,770 --> 02:37:08,190
Mommy.

2380
02:37:11,510 --> 02:37:12,350
Oh, just...

2381
02:37:13,190 --> 02:37:13,610
Okay.

2382
02:37:14,050 --> 02:37:14,950
Just an enemy rush?

2383
02:37:15,090 --> 02:37:15,710
I guess so.

2384
02:37:17,130 --> 02:37:18,430
I should have...

2385
02:37:18,430 --> 02:37:19,010
My bad.

2386
02:37:19,350 --> 02:37:19,590
Oh, well.

2387
02:37:22,630 --> 02:37:23,050
Please.

2388
02:37:23,970 --> 02:37:25,570
I feel like I'm gonna run out of time.

2389
02:37:28,730 --> 02:37:30,290
Oh, we're almost out of the tunnel.

2390
02:37:30,470 --> 02:37:31,390
We're almost out of the tunnel!

2391
02:37:31,910 --> 02:37:32,910
We're almost out!

2392
02:37:33,610 --> 02:37:35,170
Okay, all right.

2393
02:37:37,990 --> 02:37:41,210
I probably didn't need to do that, but I was nervous, okay?

2394
02:37:42,530 --> 02:37:43,570
Don't risk it.

2395
02:37:43,810 --> 02:37:44,470
Don't- 98!

2396
02:37:45,790 --> 02:37:47,650
Don't risk it!

2397
02:37:48,550 --> 02:37:50,270
Okay, what is that?

2398
02:37:54,300 --> 02:37:54,840
Oh my gosh.

2399
02:38:00,810 --> 02:38:02,870
What is it, though?

2400
02:38:03,830 --> 02:38:04,250
Hmm.

2401
02:38:04,710 --> 02:38:05,770
Where do I go here?

2402
02:38:06,450 --> 02:38:07,610
Okay, here.

2403
02:38:10,150 --> 02:38:11,150
Nice.

2404
02:38:12,330 --> 02:38:12,790
Oh yeah.

2405
02:38:14,930 --> 02:38:15,090
Hmm?

2406
02:38:18,490 --> 02:38:18,910
Okay.

2407
02:38:20,090 --> 02:38:22,750
I'm not quite sure how this...

2408
02:38:23,870 --> 02:38:27,290
I see stuff over there, but I can't see anything.

2409
02:38:28,770 --> 02:38:28,950
Oh!

2410
02:38:29,510 --> 02:38:30,770
The momentum!

2411
02:38:34,230 --> 02:38:35,090
Hmm.

2412
02:38:36,270 --> 02:38:37,870
Oh god, this stage.

2413
02:38:41,770 --> 02:38:44,690
Is it like an invisible floor or something or...

2414
02:38:45,610 --> 02:38:45,990
No?

2415
02:38:47,810 --> 02:38:48,870
No, okay.

2416
02:38:51,430 --> 02:38:53,170
What do you mean a graphical error?

2417
02:38:54,610 --> 02:38:56,530
What do you mean a graphical error?

2418
02:38:57,910 --> 02:38:59,650
Don't overthink it!

2419
02:39:04,670 --> 02:39:06,010
Wait, so do I go to...

2420
02:39:06,010 --> 02:39:06,770
Which...

2421
02:39:06,770 --> 02:39:08,790
It's the treasure chest wraparound.

2422
02:39:09,030 --> 02:39:09,830
Oh, okay, okay.

2423
02:39:17,550 --> 02:39:19,810
You can just, you can jump.

2424
02:39:21,770 --> 02:39:23,230
Oh, there's not anything on the right side.

2425
02:39:31,860 --> 02:39:33,200
Oh, oh, shoot.

2426
02:39:41,270 --> 02:39:41,910
No way.

2427
02:39:42,590 --> 02:39:43,550
Am I trapped in here?

2428
02:39:46,210 --> 02:39:48,070
Ah, I don't know how to do.

2429
02:39:50,330 --> 02:39:50,950
I don't know.

2430
02:39:51,990 --> 02:39:52,450
I don't know.

2431
02:39:55,770 --> 02:39:56,470
I don't know.

2432
02:39:56,870 --> 02:39:58,230
Oh, my God, that was so close.

2433
02:39:58,770 --> 02:39:59,370
So close.

2434
02:40:00,590 --> 02:40:01,190
Heep.

2435
02:40:01,970 --> 02:40:02,570
Okay.

2436
02:40:09,170 --> 02:40:10,450
Slow and steady.

2437
02:40:21,560 --> 02:40:22,160
Okay.

2438
02:40:23,300 --> 02:40:24,520
Don't fall, don't fall.

2439
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:25,640
Nice.

2440
02:40:28,400 --> 02:40:28,660
Okay.

2441
02:40:29,980 --> 02:40:30,280
Um.

2442
02:40:31,700 --> 02:40:31,840
Oh.

2443
02:40:40,110 --> 02:40:41,030
Wait, hello?

2444
02:40:42,330 --> 02:40:42,590
Okay.

2445
02:40:42,750 --> 02:40:43,190
Okay, there we go.

2446
02:40:44,290 --> 02:40:44,990
Uh, oh.

2447
02:40:45,450 --> 02:40:46,690
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

2448
02:40:46,990 --> 02:40:47,570
Shoot, shoot.

2449
02:40:48,250 --> 02:40:51,110
Oh, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure,
sure, okay, okay.

2450
02:40:51,990 --> 02:40:52,350
Nice.

2451
02:40:52,710 --> 02:40:53,450
Just one more, mommy.

2452
02:40:58,350 --> 02:40:59,790
I hope I'm going the right way.

2453
02:41:00,130 --> 02:41:01,550
Oh, no, they're coming from this way, too!

2454
02:41:02,250 --> 02:41:03,190
Okay, okay, run, run, run.

2455
02:41:09,630 --> 02:41:09,990
Okay.

2456
02:41:10,750 --> 02:41:11,410
Oh, my gosh.

2457
02:41:11,570 --> 02:41:11,890
Please.

2458
02:41:19,450 --> 02:41:23,710
I would have been really, been really sad if I had died of
that butt.

2459
02:41:25,710 --> 02:41:26,070
Okay.

2460
02:41:26,170 --> 02:41:31,570
I can't tell if I can jump over these guys or not, but I'm
not gonna risk it.

2461
02:41:32,210 --> 02:41:32,830
It's a lot of mummies.

2462
02:41:33,030 --> 02:41:34,950
It's so many mummies!

2463
02:41:35,610 --> 02:41:36,290
Get out of here!

2464
02:41:36,530 --> 02:41:37,430
Oh no, no, no, no!

2465
02:41:37,990 --> 02:41:39,430
Oh my god, no, no, no, no!

2466
02:41:42,310 --> 02:41:43,170
Oh my god.

2467
02:41:47,710 --> 02:41:48,890
Go away, mummy!

2468
02:41:49,210 --> 02:41:51,310
I hope I don't even know if I'm going the right way.

2469
02:41:52,190 --> 02:41:53,950
I don't even know if I'm going the right way.

2470
02:41:55,790 --> 02:41:56,190
Okay.

2471
02:41:57,290 --> 02:41:57,810
All right.

2472
02:41:58,870 --> 02:41:59,310
Onwards.

2473
02:42:00,230 --> 02:42:01,230
Atlantis, no Nazo!

2474
02:42:03,170 --> 02:42:09,830
Atlantis, your Nazo will be solved by my hands and my brain.

2475
02:42:10,070 --> 02:42:10,770
Oh my gosh.

2476
02:42:11,070 --> 02:42:11,190
Oh,

2477
02:42:15,550 --> 02:42:16,450
I'm gonna run out of time.

2478
02:42:16,790 --> 02:42:18,570
Okay, I think I have to risk it.

2479
02:42:19,150 --> 02:42:19,910
I have to risk it.

2480
02:42:24,130 --> 02:42:24,870
Oh my god.

2481
02:42:26,250 --> 02:42:26,570
You know what?

2482
02:42:26,570 --> 02:42:27,050
It's fine.

2483
02:42:27,770 --> 02:42:29,090
I ran out of time anyway.

2484
02:42:30,070 --> 02:42:31,910
Is your rage meter still at 0%?

2485
02:42:32,210 --> 02:42:34,330
Yeah, actually I'm feeling not so bad.

2486
02:42:34,450 --> 02:42:35,910
Oh my god.

2487
02:42:37,370 --> 02:42:38,330
Poop bat!

2488
02:42:42,270 --> 02:42:45,930
Sometimes they're like glitching on the sides and it's
freaking me out.

2489
02:42:46,750 --> 02:42:47,830
Where's all the mummies at?

2490
02:42:48,430 --> 02:42:49,750
What the hell is this?

2491
02:42:50,550 --> 02:42:51,890
Where are the mummies at?

2492
02:42:56,180 --> 02:42:56,660
Yippee!

2493
02:42:58,240 --> 02:42:59,360
Oh, there they are.

2494
02:43:05,490 --> 02:43:06,630
That looks suspicious.

2495
02:43:08,430 --> 02:43:09,290
That looks suspicious.

2496
02:43:09,970 --> 02:43:10,490
Oh my god.

2497
02:43:10,830 --> 02:43:12,010
Oh my god!

2498
02:43:12,430 --> 02:43:13,110
Wait, please!

2499
02:43:13,590 --> 02:43:13,610
Oh!

2500
02:43:21,390 --> 02:43:23,070
Wait, what's that door up there?

2501
02:43:25,250 --> 02:43:25,350
Oh.

2502
02:43:25,650 --> 02:43:26,070
Woo!

2503
02:43:28,130 --> 02:43:28,770
Okay.

2504
02:43:32,250 --> 02:43:32,890
Yikes.

2505
02:43:33,190 --> 02:43:33,570
Okay.

2506
02:43:38,310 --> 02:43:40,670
Oh my god, the timing is...

2507
02:43:40,670 --> 02:43:41,670
Oh my god.

2508
02:43:49,750 --> 02:43:51,610
You have to be speed, Minto.

2509
02:43:54,490 --> 02:43:55,730
What if I just jump over it?

2510
02:43:56,930 --> 02:43:57,110
Oh!

2511
02:43:59,310 --> 02:44:01,110
I only have two lives left.

2512
02:44:01,810 --> 02:44:02,890
Can you duck and bomb?

2513
02:44:03,510 --> 02:44:03,950
We'll see.

2514
02:44:16,590 --> 02:44:20,550
Oh my god, if I bomb, I sit up so I get hit.

2515
02:44:21,590 --> 02:44:23,010
Oh my god, no way.

2516
02:44:23,910 --> 02:44:24,770
Okay, hold on.

2517
02:44:24,850 --> 02:44:28,690
Oh, he shoots both ways.

2518
02:44:32,990 --> 02:44:35,150
Is that even possible to do?

2519
02:44:40,790 --> 02:44:42,630
I don't even think that's possible.

2520
02:44:43,010 --> 02:44:45,390
How am I supposed to jump and duck at the same time?

2521
02:44:45,830 --> 02:44:46,290
It is?

2522
02:44:46,370 --> 02:44:47,010
It's possible?

2523
02:44:54,970 --> 02:44:56,250
Yes, but it's hard.

2524
02:44:57,510 --> 02:44:57,930
Oh my god.

2525
02:44:58,350 --> 02:45:02,770
Even the AI dies on level 10.

2526
02:45:04,330 --> 02:45:06,630
This room is insanely precise to do without a power-up.

2527
02:45:07,130 --> 02:45:09,350
Kodani did it, but it took many attempts to memorize.

2528
02:45:09,730 --> 02:45:10,530
Okay.

2529
02:45:14,160 --> 02:45:16,200
So now we have two options here.

2530
02:45:17,820 --> 02:45:19,120
Now we have two options here.

2531
02:45:20,100 --> 02:45:21,300
We can either.

2532
02:45:22,960 --> 02:45:24,000
We can either.

2533
02:45:24,320 --> 02:45:25,600
Where's my strategy guide?

2534
02:45:26,360 --> 02:45:28,200
We can either go that route.

2535
02:45:29,020 --> 02:45:36,360
Which, now that I know how to get past 50 seconds, it's not
so bad.

2536
02:45:37,140 --> 02:45:41,380
It's not so bad getting past it and getting to the rest of
it.

2537
02:45:42,060 --> 02:45:44,580
It would be the hundredth that would be the most difficult.

2538
02:45:47,020 --> 02:45:54,360
But there's also this invincibility route, but that also
involves going through eight, which isn't, in theory, I

2539
02:45:54,360 --> 02:45:55,940
guess, so bad, but ten!

2540
02:46:04,570 --> 02:46:08,190
Ten is where we would really struggle, I think.

2541
02:46:09,190 --> 02:46:09,790
I say we.

2542
02:46:10,110 --> 02:46:10,890
It's really just me.

2543
02:46:13,430 --> 02:46:15,170
You'll get better at eight and ten.

2544
02:46:15,370 --> 02:46:16,550
You think so?

2545
02:46:18,750 --> 02:46:20,010
10 was the trees and the clouds?

2546
02:46:20,330 --> 02:46:22,030
Yeah, 10 was the trees and the clouds.

2547
02:46:22,910 --> 02:46:24,610
And then I don't even know what's beyond there.

2548
02:46:25,630 --> 02:46:27,050
But it's the invincibility route.

2549
02:46:27,470 --> 02:46:32,190
So I'm assuming the star makes us invincible.

2550
02:46:33,650 --> 02:46:34,530
Against enemies.

2551
02:46:47,350 --> 02:46:48,410
I'll make a pull.

2552
02:46:53,490 --> 02:46:57,710
Which route, which seat should I take?

2553
02:46:58,970 --> 02:47:00,600
Which route should we take?

2554
02:47:02,250 --> 02:47:03,810
Route 10.

2555
02:47:04,970 --> 02:47:09,810
Actually, I'll say, uh, route, invin-sib, uh, route 10.

2556
02:47:11,090 --> 02:47:11,710
Route 100.

2557
02:47:12,070 --> 02:47:14,090
I guess those are the most difficult ones.

2558
02:47:16,250 --> 02:47:17,030
Nagoya.

2559
02:47:17,370 --> 02:47:17,870
No!

2560
02:47:26,350 --> 02:47:27,530
Harem route.

2561
02:47:28,670 --> 02:47:29,730
Hi, wait.

2562
02:47:31,930 --> 02:47:43,230
I don't mind trying 10 a couple more times but like how long
of a route how long is it you know I'm scared why is it

2563
02:47:43,230 --> 02:47:54,510
50-50 what's wrong with you guys which path leads to
Akihabara I don't know

2564
02:47:57,550 --> 02:48:03,710
the route is a 10 but it's impossible Rout 100 is winning.

2565
02:48:04,830 --> 02:48:06,210
Are there two different level 100?

2566
02:48:06,910 --> 02:48:08,430
I don't know, actually.

2567
02:48:10,130 --> 02:48:11,230
I have no idea.

2568
02:48:11,350 --> 02:48:12,690
What is this level even?

2569
02:48:15,290 --> 02:48:17,930
There's so much of this game that I feel like...

2570
02:48:17,930 --> 02:48:19,670
Look, 88, we also get a star.

2571
02:48:20,530 --> 02:48:23,490
There's so much of this game that we're skipping over, but
you know what?

2572
02:48:24,510 --> 02:48:25,590
Oh, oh, my bad.

2573
02:48:25,850 --> 02:48:26,870
The dark zone.

2574
02:48:28,690 --> 02:48:28,950
Wait.

2575
02:48:29,750 --> 02:48:30,330
I'm trying to...

2576
02:48:30,330 --> 02:48:31,750
What is the dark zone?

2577
02:48:33,350 --> 02:48:34,750
Ah, stop it!

2578
02:48:35,370 --> 02:48:36,330
I'm trying to read.

2579
02:48:40,670 --> 02:48:43,210
Dark zone and freeze zone.

2580
02:48:46,430 --> 02:48:47,070
Interesting.

2581
02:48:47,930 --> 02:48:49,110
A zone that is dark.

2582
02:48:52,990 --> 02:48:54,130
55%...

2583
02:48:54,130 --> 02:48:55,910
56% on Route 100.

2584
02:49:02,240 --> 02:49:03,500
This is killing me.

2585
02:49:03,520 --> 02:49:04,580
I'm not even watching this screen.

2586
02:49:04,600 --> 02:49:13,740
But just hearing the game start and then he jumps and
immediately dies is kind of sending me All right, the

2587
02:49:13,740 --> 02:49:15,000
mystery adventure starts

2588
02:49:38,170 --> 02:49:40,330
I had to jump over that though.

2589
02:49:40,530 --> 02:49:41,630
I just got the timing wrong

2590
02:49:45,370 --> 02:49:49,090
Sunsoft started doing stuff again and I hope they come back
to this game

2591
02:49:53,190 --> 02:49:57,850
Wow what are you a masochist

2592
02:50:01,150 --> 02:50:10,730
though it's kind of interesting seeing that it's like not
like you can I can only play this in the JP side you know so

2593
02:50:11,990 --> 02:50:12,510
Okay.

2594
02:50:13,390 --> 02:50:13,910
Oops.

2595
02:50:15,130 --> 02:50:15,390
Oops.

2596
02:50:15,990 --> 02:50:16,630
Wrong way.

2597
02:50:17,250 --> 02:50:19,650
Okay, let's get some points so we can...

2598
02:50:20,270 --> 02:50:21,570
I think you'll get more health.

2599
02:50:21,790 --> 02:50:23,670
Yeah, we're back to the seven, so awesome.

2600
02:50:31,900 --> 02:50:34,660
Oh, my game...

2601
02:50:34,660 --> 02:50:36,580
Glitched for a second.

2602
02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:41,420
And now we know where to go.

2603
02:50:43,920 --> 02:50:44,440
Okay.

2604
02:50:44,460 --> 02:50:46,320
So I'm not so scared.

2605
02:50:47,400 --> 02:50:48,980
Just a little scared.

2606
02:50:49,480 --> 02:50:50,780
Just a little scared.

2607
02:50:55,100 --> 02:50:55,240
Oh.

2608
02:50:55,960 --> 02:50:56,360
Uh.

2609
02:51:02,930 --> 02:51:03,730
Yippee!

2610
02:51:07,430 --> 02:51:08,590
I want...

2611
02:51:08,590 --> 02:51:10,910
I'm so curious what those chests are.

2612
02:51:13,290 --> 02:51:14,330
Oh, okay.

2613
02:51:14,410 --> 02:51:15,130
I remember this one.

2614
02:51:18,540 --> 02:51:19,040
Uh.

2615
02:51:19,560 --> 02:51:20,100
Ooh.

2616
02:51:20,200 --> 02:51:22,560
Oh, don't, don't, don't, don't poop on me.

2617
02:51:24,720 --> 02:51:26,220
I can't tell if I'm killing anything.

2618
02:51:26,660 --> 02:51:27,380
Hopa-bopopopopop.

2619
02:51:31,460 --> 02:51:32,140
Ah!

2620
02:51:33,100 --> 02:51:34,520
Oh, my god.

2621
02:51:34,860 --> 02:51:35,780
Oh my god.

2622
02:51:36,120 --> 02:51:37,340
I don't know how I live.

2623
02:51:38,340 --> 02:51:41,080
I don't know how I live through.

2624
02:51:41,540 --> 02:51:42,840
I don't know how I live.

2625
02:51:43,220 --> 02:51:43,480
Okay.

2626
02:51:48,970 --> 02:51:49,990
Oh, sheesh.

2627
02:51:51,990 --> 02:51:52,470
Okay.

2628
02:51:53,870 --> 02:51:56,850
Okay, and here we blow up.

2629
02:52:00,110 --> 02:52:01,030
Easy peasy.

2630
02:52:05,170 --> 02:52:07,330
What was this one again?

2631
02:52:07,730 --> 02:52:08,430
Oh, mummy.

2632
02:52:15,150 --> 02:52:16,750
Mommy time.

2633
02:52:24,810 --> 02:52:26,190
This one we just keep running.

2634
02:52:29,650 --> 02:52:30,030
Mommy.

2635
02:52:32,390 --> 02:52:34,730
Have you ever played La Mulana?

2636
02:52:38,170 --> 02:52:38,850
Oh my gosh.

2637
02:52:39,130 --> 02:52:39,810
I need to pay attention.

2638
02:52:40,050 --> 02:52:40,970
It sounds familiar.

2639
02:52:42,230 --> 02:52:43,630
But I've never played it before.

2640
02:52:45,790 --> 02:52:47,030
Maybe if I saw it, I'd know.

2641
02:52:55,860 --> 02:52:56,860
Oh, cute.

2642
02:53:04,970 --> 02:53:11,490
There was like another game that I'm Oh my god, wait, oh my
god, wait, oh wait, wait, wait Wait,

2643
02:53:15,130 --> 02:53:18,250
oh, wait, wait, wait Are you kidding me?

2644
02:53:20,130 --> 02:53:23,170
Since when could you throw fireballs?

2645
02:53:26,590 --> 02:53:30,170
Since when could you throw fireballs at me?

2646
02:53:33,170 --> 02:53:35,290
He just pulled out a gun.

2647
02:53:36,130 --> 02:53:36,510
Yo!

2648
02:53:39,070 --> 02:53:51,810
messed up he said call an ambulance but not for me can

2649
02:53:55,090 --> 02:54:02,410
you imagine if you couldn't move while like the bomb was
while the bomb was deployed to how much more difficult can

2650
02:54:02,410 --> 02:54:10,590
we make this game there's a second version of mummies with
ranged attacks and they look they look the exact same

2651
02:54:12,790 --> 02:54:14,970
There's no distinction between them.

2652
02:54:15,590 --> 02:54:16,830
Before, I think I just ran...

2653
02:54:16,830 --> 02:54:20,430
I think I just was able to run past him, so I didn't even
pay him any...

2654
02:54:28,840 --> 02:54:32,300
I think he was in a different spot before, so I didn't have
to pay him any mind.

2655
02:54:36,300 --> 02:54:36,640
Uh-oh.

2656
02:54:37,040 --> 02:54:42,520
I think the less creatures that are in the front, the more
that are in the tube.

2657
02:54:45,820 --> 02:54:46,180
Oh.

2658
02:54:48,840 --> 02:54:57,600
Okay, we didn't struggle before because the RNG was on our
side, but I have faith we can get through this as well, even

2659
02:54:57,600 --> 02:54:58,960
though we're wasting a little bit of lives.

2660
02:54:59,080 --> 02:55:05,120
I just have to get used to this new zombie fellow, you know,
our new mummy friend with his gun.

2661
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:12,520
They only shoot fireballs if they hit a ledge.

2662
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:19,200
They're like, I'm not attacking you enough.

2663
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:23,040
I really gotta...

2664
02:55:23,040 --> 02:55:25,300
I really gotta get you good.

2665
02:55:25,880 --> 02:55:28,860
Are these supposed to be scorpions or...

2666
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:35,920
Oh my gosh.

2667
02:55:37,360 --> 02:55:37,600
Wait.

2668
02:55:38,340 --> 02:55:39,900
Uh, there we go.

2669
02:55:46,800 --> 02:55:47,360
Earwigs.

2670
02:55:47,620 --> 02:55:49,160
Oh, gross.

2671
02:55:54,220 --> 02:55:56,300
I wonder if it's worth getting that.

2672
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:02,360
Oh!

2673
02:56:03,740 --> 02:56:05,340
I didn't know there were some guys up here.

2674
02:56:12,720 --> 02:56:13,920
Slow and steady.

2675
02:56:18,050 --> 02:56:18,450
Why?

2676
02:56:20,090 --> 02:56:22,130
Sometimes he doesn't fall off the ledge.

2677
02:56:22,210 --> 02:56:22,390
Ow!

2678
02:56:22,530 --> 02:56:23,110
No, no, no, no, no.

2679
02:56:23,130 --> 02:56:24,330
I almost blew myself up.

2680
02:56:25,730 --> 02:56:29,490
Sometimes he doesn't walk off the ledge, and sometimes he's
just like...

2681
02:56:29,490 --> 02:56:31,290
Sometimes he's just like, yep.

2682
02:56:32,890 --> 02:56:34,150
I'm just gonna keep going.

2683
02:56:34,170 --> 02:56:47,790
what why you saw last time I was able to do it by just kind
of inching my way over what was the difference oh what was

2684
02:56:47,790 --> 02:57:04,170
the difference walk the other direction I think when you're
falling oh my gosh oh okay there we go 99th zone okay oh I I

2685
02:57:04,170 --> 02:57:06,110
can jump over these guys.

2686
02:57:16,650 --> 02:57:17,250
Just kidding.

2687
02:57:18,310 --> 02:57:19,190
How many lives do I have left?

2688
02:57:19,350 --> 02:57:20,130
Only five.

2689
02:57:22,370 --> 02:57:24,630
She's silly, I love her.

2690
02:57:27,930 --> 02:57:29,870
Thank you for the donut.

2691
02:57:35,210 --> 02:57:40,050
Do you guys think that making sound effects enhances your
gaming ability?

2692
02:57:40,570 --> 02:57:41,670
Because I believe it does.

2693
02:57:41,690 --> 02:57:44,230
for me, personally.

2694
02:57:45,470 --> 02:57:45,650
You know?

2695
02:57:46,350 --> 02:57:49,950
I believe it allows me to go further beyond.

2696
02:57:56,030 --> 02:57:56,570
Help!

2697
02:57:58,010 --> 02:57:58,730
Never mind.

2698
02:58:02,900 --> 02:58:06,260
Yeah, I'm going this way.

2699
02:58:16,210 --> 02:58:17,450
Don't poop on me.

2700
02:58:19,830 --> 02:58:20,190
Oh!

2701
02:58:20,490 --> 02:58:20,870
Oh!

2702
02:58:22,210 --> 02:58:23,410
If I had just waited...

2703
02:58:23,410 --> 02:58:23,710
Oh, wait.

2704
02:58:24,210 --> 02:58:25,570
Oh, they started throwing stuff.

2705
02:58:25,710 --> 02:58:26,330
Did you see that?

2706
02:58:26,610 --> 02:58:29,350
It would have actually been impossible to get there
because...

2707
02:58:29,350 --> 02:58:30,010
Oh, not impossible.

2708
02:58:30,130 --> 02:58:31,090
We would have just had to kill them.

2709
02:58:31,410 --> 02:58:31,890
I don't know what to think about.

2710
02:58:31,950 --> 02:58:35,010
But also, we would have had to kill them while ducking the
whole time.

2711
02:58:35,110 --> 02:58:37,670
And I can't duck and shoot at the same time.

2712
02:58:37,910 --> 02:58:40,050
Why is my RNG so bad this time?

2713
02:58:41,990 --> 02:58:42,350
Okay.

2714
02:58:42,710 --> 02:58:43,950
I'm fine.

2715
02:58:47,070 --> 02:58:48,710
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

2716
02:58:49,430 --> 02:58:51,090
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

2717
02:59:11,040 --> 02:59:12,300
Let's go this way.

2718
02:59:16,740 --> 02:59:18,660
Oh, I pressed the wrong button.

2719
02:59:18,800 --> 02:59:19,380
That was my fault.

2720
02:59:19,560 --> 02:59:20,980
I think I'm going to game over, yeah.

2721
02:59:23,120 --> 02:59:25,400
Seems you had really good RNG in this level previous.

2722
02:59:25,500 --> 02:59:26,120
It's true.

2723
02:59:26,520 --> 02:59:26,920
It's true.

2724
02:59:27,120 --> 02:59:29,700
There was the second time that it went through and there was
no zombies.

2725
02:59:30,160 --> 02:59:31,960
Battle cries definitely help enhance gameplay.

2726
02:59:33,660 --> 02:59:34,540
It's okay.

2727
02:59:51,930 --> 02:59:54,530
I don't think I want to go through Zone 100.

2728
02:59:56,650 --> 02:59:58,070
You guys, I'm thinking about it.

2729
03:00:00,310 --> 03:00:02,150
I don't know if I want to go through Zone 100.

2730
03:00:02,890 --> 03:00:04,430
Let's try Zone 10 a little more.

2731
03:00:04,850 --> 03:00:06,750
I think I'm better with jumping now, right?

2732
03:00:08,230 --> 03:00:17,730
so I think I think I might be able to do it wait how do I go
through three and then I skip right is that what it was I

2733
03:00:17,730 --> 03:00:18,590
can't remember actually

2734
03:00:32,560 --> 03:00:44,480
we decided to go this way I go to three and then I go to yes
because I got to get the boots at six and this is fish watch

2735
03:00:44,480 --> 03:00:52,200
out for fish watch out for fish Watch out for fish, watch
out for fish, watch out for fish, watch out for fish, okay.

2736
03:00:59,310 --> 03:01:01,010
And it's this one.

2737
03:01:01,950 --> 03:01:03,450
This one right there.

2738
03:01:12,310 --> 03:01:12,830
Yippee!

2739
03:01:15,370 --> 03:01:16,370
Eighth zone!

2740
03:01:16,610 --> 03:01:18,330
Oh no, I forgot about the eighth zone.

2741
03:01:19,610 --> 03:01:21,750
Oh, oh eighth zone.

2742
03:01:22,510 --> 03:01:24,330
Eighth zone, please be kind to me.

2743
03:01:29,330 --> 03:01:32,990
is what has made me better at the game, truly.

2744
03:01:34,470 --> 03:01:43,710
Just mastering, I can't say that I've mastered it, but
getting past this zone is what I think made me better at the

2745
03:01:43,710 --> 03:01:44,060
game.

2746
03:01:45,130 --> 03:01:45,490
Okay.

2747
03:01:46,170 --> 03:01:46,870
Okay.

2748
03:01:47,830 --> 03:01:48,070
There.

2749
03:01:48,850 --> 03:01:49,790
Oh my god.

2750
03:01:50,170 --> 03:01:53,230
I say as I die.

2751
03:01:56,230 --> 03:01:58,590
I hate zone 8.

2752
03:01:58,870 --> 03:01:59,270
I hate.

2753
03:01:59,330 --> 03:02:07,510
Zone 8, I hate Zone 8, I hate Zone 8, I hate Zone 8, I hate
Zone 8, I hate it!

2754
03:02:07,910 --> 03:02:09,410
Why are there two of you?

2755
03:02:11,230 --> 03:02:13,310
I hate Zone 8!

2756
03:02:16,550 --> 03:02:17,970
Oh, that was a close one.

2757
03:02:19,970 --> 03:02:20,910
Phew, shoo, shoo, shoo.

2758
03:02:21,690 --> 03:02:23,310
Oh, uh, my bad.

2759
03:02:23,890 --> 03:02:25,090
Did not mean to...

2760
03:02:25,090 --> 03:02:25,590
You know what?

2761
03:02:25,930 --> 03:02:26,450
That's fine.

2762
03:02:29,670 --> 03:02:30,610
And we're back here.

2763
03:02:30,890 --> 03:02:35,190
I remember my strats to, oh my gosh.

2764
03:02:35,650 --> 03:02:36,810
Shup, ah, shup.

2765
03:02:38,010 --> 03:02:38,490
Shup.

2766
03:02:39,910 --> 03:02:40,390
Shup.

2767
03:02:41,330 --> 03:02:41,810
Shup.

2768
03:02:42,490 --> 03:02:42,830
Shup.

2769
03:02:42,870 --> 03:02:43,350
Shup.

2770
03:02:43,350 --> 03:02:43,550
Shup.

2771
03:02:44,730 --> 03:02:46,550
Okay, good, good, good, good.

2772
03:02:46,730 --> 03:02:48,570
Okay, now we, be careful here.

2773
03:02:48,970 --> 03:02:49,570
Shup, shup.

2774
03:02:49,930 --> 03:02:50,050
Okay.

2775
03:02:51,450 --> 03:02:52,330
We made it.

2776
03:02:52,390 --> 03:02:55,010
That's the most difficult part for me.

2777
03:02:56,530 --> 03:02:56,770
Shup.

2778
03:03:03,250 --> 03:03:04,930
Oh, I don't have a lot of time left, though.

2779
03:03:06,010 --> 03:03:07,010
We made it!

2780
03:03:08,670 --> 03:03:09,090
Okay.

2781
03:03:12,130 --> 03:03:12,370
Okay.

2782
03:03:21,260 --> 03:03:22,500
And it was about here.

2783
03:03:24,080 --> 03:03:24,480
Yes.

2784
03:03:41,110 --> 03:03:44,690
I'm really having to like take such deep breaths with this
level.

2785
03:03:47,290 --> 03:03:47,910
Pixel.

2786
03:03:48,350 --> 03:03:48,970
Perfect.

2787
03:03:49,210 --> 03:03:49,810
Precision.

2788
03:03:50,450 --> 03:03:53,510
It's not... You can't just jump off.

2789
03:03:53,530 --> 03:04:03,370
atlantis man please you can't just jump off okay you can't
just jump off would you please

2790
03:04:15,370 --> 03:04:17,310
no why john atlantis

2791
03:04:20,690 --> 03:04:27,070
i wish there was a i was gonna say i wish there was a way
that i could just practice the stage over and over again and

2792
03:04:27,070 --> 03:04:35,190
I mean technically if I were to save state it I could but
I'm not going to do that I'm going to do it proper oh my god

2793
03:04:35,190 --> 03:04:40,650
why did I not just jump to the next one I knew the next one
would make it

2794
03:04:47,990 --> 03:04:59,890
okay and then if I don't get the star I have to go back
which is even worse I have to go back I have to go all the

2795
03:04:59,890 --> 03:05:05,670
way back And try and get it again Okay Oh nice I made it
somehow

2796
03:05:13,700 --> 03:05:32,240
The worst part is If I don't If I don't make it past it Or
if I make it past this And then And then there's an even

2797
03:05:32,240 --> 03:05:33,140
harder level.

2798
03:05:33,820 --> 03:05:35,140
What do I do?

2799
03:05:36,120 --> 03:05:37,940
What do I do?

2800
03:05:42,590 --> 03:05:46,850
Because it'll make the last level easy because I'll have
this invincibility.

2801
03:05:47,930 --> 03:05:50,370
But if there's something even worse than this,

2802
03:05:55,920 --> 03:05:58,800
it's these tiny guys, you know, in the middle.

2803
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:00,360
Okay.

2804
03:06:05,350 --> 03:06:06,310
Just jump.

2805
03:06:07,870 --> 03:06:08,310
Ah!

2806
03:06:19,560 --> 03:06:23,020
Oh my god, oh my god.

2807
03:06:26,950 --> 03:06:28,230
Oh, yo, yo.

2808
03:06:40,470 --> 03:06:42,510
That was a close one.

2809
03:06:43,630 --> 03:06:44,030
Boop.

2810
03:06:51,950 --> 03:06:52,230
Okay.

2811
03:06:56,890 --> 03:06:58,570
Oh, my ear is just...

2812
03:06:59,110 --> 03:06:59,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2813
03:07:00,170 --> 03:07:00,870
Yeah, yeah.

2814
03:07:05,530 --> 03:07:12,910
One thing I think is the most forgiving about this game is,
like, with specifically these guys, you can, oh, you can

2815
03:07:12,910 --> 03:07:16,890
shoot the bomb anywhere on the screen and they'll, like,
duck, you know?

2816
03:07:17,270 --> 03:07:27,410
So if I, like, have to do it, like, in front of them or
beside them so that it doesn't hit me too, it all works out.

2817
03:07:27,650 --> 03:07:28,510
There we go.

2818
03:07:29,150 --> 03:07:29,890
Third zone.

2819
03:07:31,970 --> 03:07:34,230
Oh god, you have to screen start from zone one.

2820
03:07:34,870 --> 03:07:35,350
Oh, yeah.

2821
03:07:36,170 --> 03:07:37,250
Oh, yeah.

2822
03:07:37,790 --> 03:07:38,830
Oh, yeah.

2823
03:07:39,150 --> 03:07:40,890
What do you think this was?

2824
03:07:46,030 --> 03:07:46,590
Fish!

2825
03:07:51,210 --> 03:07:52,210
This one.

2826
03:07:52,630 --> 03:07:53,730
Sixth zone.

2827
03:07:57,290 --> 03:08:01,070
Oh, I missed the exit.

2828
03:08:01,230 --> 03:08:02,010
I missed the exit.

2829
03:08:05,030 --> 03:08:10,250
game eighth zone

2830
03:08:16,800 --> 03:08:30,080
eighth zone I said that about eighth zone but maybe maybe um
tenth zone will make me really good at this game too I guess

2831
03:08:30,080 --> 03:08:40,420
we'll have to see if I can ever clear it my god it seems
like the most impossible feat ever

2832
03:08:45,430 --> 03:08:48,230
Oh, okay, we're here.

2833
03:08:56,150 --> 03:08:56,490
Nice.

2834
03:08:57,590 --> 03:08:59,910
All right.

2835
03:09:00,770 --> 03:09:01,050
Oh,

2836
03:09:05,190 --> 03:09:08,190
you can't jump down from the third flap.

2837
03:09:09,210 --> 03:09:09,370
Oh.

2838
03:09:10,670 --> 03:09:11,510
Oh.

2839
03:09:21,830 --> 03:09:23,430
Whoa, that was close.

2840
03:09:52,520 --> 03:09:54,360
This one works fine.

2841
03:09:54,920 --> 03:09:55,400
Okay.

2842
03:09:56,480 --> 03:09:56,960
Okay.

2843
03:09:57,420 --> 03:09:57,860
Alright.

2844
03:10:02,880 --> 03:10:03,360
Okay.

2845
03:10:03,900 --> 03:10:04,600
There we go.

2846
03:10:04,880 --> 03:10:06,300
You have to go from the tippy top.

2847
03:10:10,410 --> 03:10:12,870
Just in case I fell through there.

2848
03:10:18,110 --> 03:10:18,550
Oh my god.

2849
03:10:19,530 --> 03:10:20,930
I knew that was gonna happen.

2850
03:10:26,140 --> 03:10:27,720
I knew that was gonna happen.

2851
03:10:28,300 --> 03:10:29,520
As soon as it happened.

2852
03:10:30,340 --> 03:10:35,440
As soon as I touched the wall, I was like, I'm gonna, this
damn bomb's gonna explode in my face.

2853
03:10:37,180 --> 03:10:37,660
Oh.

2854
03:10:58,440 --> 03:10:59,320
Music.

2855
03:11:01,980 --> 03:11:02,300
What the?

2856
03:11:04,240 --> 03:11:05,680
Where did you come from?

2857
03:11:06,860 --> 03:11:08,340
There's never been a...

2858
03:11:08,340 --> 03:11:10,560
Oh, crap here!

2859
03:11:14,370 --> 03:11:14,750
Nice.

2860
03:11:15,690 --> 03:11:16,070
Okay.

2861
03:11:16,790 --> 03:11:17,090
Please.

2862
03:11:19,830 --> 03:11:21,110
That was close.

2863
03:11:22,550 --> 03:11:25,830
But close still means we made it.

2864
03:11:26,550 --> 03:11:27,070
For now.

2865
03:11:28,070 --> 03:11:28,410
Okay.

2866
03:11:31,370 --> 03:11:31,830
Yes.

2867
03:11:32,770 --> 03:11:33,550
Tenth zone.

2868
03:11:35,650 --> 03:11:37,130
Orangey is a cruel mistress.

2869
03:11:41,110 --> 03:11:41,270
Wait.

2870
03:11:46,410 --> 03:11:47,410
Oh, wait.

2871
03:11:47,810 --> 03:11:48,750
I got the shoes, right?

2872
03:11:53,670 --> 03:11:55,010
I got the shoes, right?

2873
03:11:55,170 --> 03:11:56,390
Or am I...

2874
03:11:56,390 --> 03:11:57,510
Oh, okay, yeah.

2875
03:11:58,290 --> 03:11:58,970
I don't know why.

2876
03:11:59,670 --> 03:12:00,990
Everything's starting to blend together.

2877
03:12:02,310 --> 03:12:03,790
Everything's starting to blend together.

2878
03:12:06,390 --> 03:12:07,530
Oh, oh, oh.

2879
03:12:07,970 --> 03:12:08,890
Oh my god, no!

2880
03:12:15,780 --> 03:12:22,200
Wait, am I an idiot?

2881
03:12:23,500 --> 03:12:24,960
Yes, yes you are mate.

2882
03:12:25,620 --> 03:12:26,340
You're stupid!

2883
03:12:27,140 --> 03:12:32,240
Oh my

2884
03:12:36,390 --> 03:12:36,570
god.

2885
03:12:37,670 --> 03:12:38,350
Okay.

2886
03:12:40,670 --> 03:12:42,850
You know what?

2887
03:12:42,890 --> 03:12:43,450
Grab that.

2888
03:12:43,770 --> 03:12:47,050
Maybe we'll get an extra life from it.

2889
03:12:47,790 --> 03:12:49,550
Oh my god, that was so close.

2890
03:12:50,610 --> 03:12:50,850
Hoi.

2891
03:12:51,590 --> 03:12:52,150
Hoi!

2892
03:13:00,690 --> 03:13:04,610
I think this is where I typically start.

2893
03:13:08,530 --> 03:13:09,110
No, no.

2894
03:13:16,470 --> 03:13:17,110
Hoi!

2895
03:13:17,370 --> 03:13:17,930
Did it!

2896
03:13:19,490 --> 03:13:21,070
And now I'm invincible!

2897
03:13:24,580 --> 03:13:25,560
I think!

2898
03:13:27,900 --> 03:13:28,980
Yeah, I'm invincible!

2899
03:13:29,720 --> 03:13:30,460
Unless he's a friend.

2900
03:13:31,360 --> 03:13:33,640
Oh my gosh, imagine if like a mimic ate me.

2901
03:13:34,280 --> 03:13:36,780
You can jump at me all you want, Bozo.

2902
03:13:37,380 --> 03:13:38,200
I can take it.

2903
03:13:38,420 --> 03:13:39,400
I can take a hint.

2904
03:13:40,480 --> 03:13:41,900
But I can't take a hint!

2905
03:13:45,160 --> 03:13:46,480
Oh my god.

2906
03:13:50,450 --> 03:13:50,710
Oh my god.

2907
03:13:50,710 --> 03:13:51,250
Oh wait, ah!

2908
03:13:51,470 --> 03:13:54,450
Oh, I almost died to my bomb, I think.

2909
03:13:57,150 --> 03:13:57,590
Okay.

2910
03:13:58,570 --> 03:13:59,270
See ya.

2911
03:13:59,350 --> 03:14:10,890

2914
03:14:34,180 --> 03:14:36,580
Okay, okay.

2915
03:14:41,540 --> 03:14:41,760
Oh!

2916
03:14:43,420 --> 03:14:44,460
Sixteenth is out!

2917
03:14:48,290 --> 03:14:48,970
What are these?

2918
03:14:49,510 --> 03:14:49,570
Oh.

2919
03:14:53,790 --> 03:14:54,330
Ooh.

2920
03:14:55,830 --> 03:14:56,370
Okay.

2921
03:14:57,870 --> 03:15:01,750
Oh my gosh, being invincible is awesome!

2922
03:15:04,690 --> 03:15:06,290
Okay, I can't.

2923
03:15:09,310 --> 03:15:12,130
Ignore it, ignore it, ignore it, ignore it.

2924
03:15:14,430 --> 03:15:17,290
I wonder if this place has a hidden...

2925
03:15:19,270 --> 03:15:20,490
door or not.

2926
03:15:20,650 --> 03:15:27,230
That's my biggest worry is losing a life because I'm just
walking and walking and I'm walking in circles like what

2927
03:15:27,230 --> 03:15:28,710
appears to be happening now.

2928
03:15:28,910 --> 03:15:29,390
Oh, never mind.

2929
03:15:29,950 --> 03:15:30,370
Five!

2930
03:15:30,610 --> 03:15:30,930
Oh!

2931
03:15:34,900 --> 03:15:36,500
She can tank the poop!

2932
03:15:36,620 --> 03:15:39,260
Hell yeah, I can tank the poop.

2933
03:15:42,480 --> 03:15:44,620
I can tank it!

2934
03:15:47,290 --> 03:15:48,930
Oh, okay.

2935
03:15:56,360 --> 03:15:58,920
I'm all- I'm- I'm covered in shit.

2936
03:15:59,520 --> 03:16:06,400
I'm- I'm- I'm- that's why- that's why they're leaving me
alone because I'm so smelly right now.

2937
03:16:17,790 --> 03:16:18,290
Okay.

2938
03:16:19,690 --> 03:16:22,130
This game has gotten infinitely easier.

2939
03:16:24,330 --> 03:16:26,370
But where's the door?

2940
03:16:27,890 --> 03:16:29,630
Speak and you shall receive.

2941
03:16:30,050 --> 03:16:31,410
21st zone!

2942
03:16:35,370 --> 03:16:35,930
Wait.

2943
03:16:40,070 --> 03:16:41,430
Is this it?

2944
03:16:41,590 --> 03:16:42,830
Is this the one I'm supposed to go through?

2945
03:16:43,690 --> 03:16:44,710
23rd zone?

2946
03:16:49,410 --> 03:16:51,170
I don't remember how many there were.

2947
03:16:52,050 --> 03:16:52,350
Between.

2948
03:16:52,870 --> 03:16:54,330
I feel like I've...

2949
03:16:54,330 --> 03:16:55,890
I feel like I messed up.

2950
03:16:57,970 --> 03:16:59,950
I feel like I messed up.

2951
03:17:00,090 --> 03:17:00,330
Uh-oh.

2952
03:17:00,570 --> 03:17:01,190
Wait, what do I...

2953
03:17:01,190 --> 03:17:01,790
Where do I...

2954
03:17:01,790 --> 03:17:03,050
Oh, do I have to make that?

2955
03:17:04,730 --> 03:17:05,150
Okay.

2956
03:17:05,910 --> 03:17:06,270
Nice.

2957
03:17:10,400 --> 03:17:12,820
Just keep going, I guess.

2958
03:17:14,520 --> 03:17:14,820
Yippee!

2959
03:17:16,280 --> 03:17:18,460
But I think if I die, I'll lose the star.

2960
03:17:18,940 --> 03:17:19,260
Okay.

2961
03:17:20,400 --> 03:17:21,220
27th zone?

2962
03:17:23,020 --> 03:17:23,460
Okay.

2963
03:17:26,700 --> 03:17:27,820
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2964
03:17:27,840 --> 03:17:33,950

2967
03:18:04,160 --> 03:18:05,360
Oh gosh.

2968
03:18:05,700 --> 03:18:06,540
Oh nice.

2969
03:18:09,220 --> 03:18:10,200
Wiki how?

2970
03:18:12,240 --> 03:18:13,600
I'm gonna pause real quick.

2971
03:18:13,740 --> 03:18:14,120
I'm actually...

2972
03:18:14,120 --> 03:18:15,280
What am I on?

2973
03:18:16,920 --> 03:18:17,400
20.

2974
03:18:18,680 --> 03:18:19,180
Uh oh.

2975
03:18:19,760 --> 03:18:21,320
I'm on the red path.

2976
03:18:22,160 --> 03:18:23,540
I was supposed to go to four.

2977
03:18:37,610 --> 03:18:39,170
I was supposed to go to four.

2978
03:18:40,310 --> 03:18:41,430
Now where am I?

2979
03:18:41,670 --> 03:18:42,350
I'm on the 23rd.

2980
03:18:42,590 --> 03:18:44,050
I'm on the blue path.

2981
03:18:44,710 --> 03:18:46,010
Oh my god, no.

2982
03:18:46,430 --> 03:18:47,350
What happened?

2983
03:18:47,930 --> 03:18:48,970
Where did the blue...

2984
03:18:48,970 --> 03:18:50,330
Where did the four-door go?

2985
03:18:50,810 --> 03:18:52,330
No, no, no, no.

2986
03:18:52,330 --> 03:18:52,790
Oh, no.

2987
03:18:54,230 --> 03:18:56,250
No, no, no.

2988
03:18:56,530 --> 03:18:57,750
God, I'm gonna have to do tech...

2989
03:19:07,190 --> 03:19:07,710
Wait a second.

2990
03:19:08,330 --> 03:19:09,470
There's two choices here.

2991
03:19:10,290 --> 03:19:10,810
Which door?

2992
03:19:11,610 --> 03:19:12,930
Which door can I take?

2993
03:19:28,450 --> 03:19:29,350
29th zone.

2994
03:19:30,170 --> 03:19:30,670
Oh, sorry!

2995
03:19:31,170 --> 03:19:31,830
Sorry, sorry!

2996
03:19:33,430 --> 03:19:34,750
I'm so sorry, you guys.

2997
03:19:34,890 --> 03:19:35,410
I'm so sorry.

2998
03:19:36,650 --> 03:19:37,810
There was two doors.

2999
03:19:39,850 --> 03:19:40,550
I'm so sorry.

3000
03:19:40,810 --> 03:19:43,110
Wait, actually now I want to see where I am again.

3001
03:19:44,890 --> 03:19:46,890
Which door would that have gone to?

3002
03:19:52,630 --> 03:19:53,770
Wait, what am I at?

3003
03:19:53,890 --> 03:19:55,050
I have no idea anymore.

3004
03:19:55,870 --> 03:19:56,390
You know what?

3005
03:19:56,790 --> 03:19:57,210
Whatever.

3006
03:19:57,510 --> 03:19:58,110
We're just...

3007
03:19:58,110 --> 03:19:59,210
This is it.

3008
03:19:59,630 --> 03:20:00,370
This is it.

3009
03:20:01,550 --> 03:20:02,030
Can I...

3010
03:20:02,030 --> 03:20:02,670
Is this land?

3011
03:20:03,770 --> 03:20:04,230
Oh, okay.

3012
03:20:04,350 --> 03:20:04,970
It is land.

3013
03:20:05,970 --> 03:20:07,770
Look at these little skulls.

3014
03:20:08,090 --> 03:20:09,250
Oh, wowie!

3015
03:20:09,250 --> 03:20:11,500
Oh, are you kidding me right now?

3016
03:20:12,550 --> 03:20:14,290
Are you kidding me right now?

3017
03:20:16,010 --> 03:20:16,810
I have to make that?

3018
03:20:16,990 --> 03:20:17,760
Okay, I made it.

3019
03:20:18,410 --> 03:20:20,350
Oh, gosh.

3020
03:20:24,070 --> 03:20:25,890
Oh, I'm so good.

3021
03:20:27,410 --> 03:20:28,170
What the?

3022
03:20:29,930 --> 03:20:31,410
I'm taking the last door.

3023
03:20:32,810 --> 03:20:33,970
31st zone.

3024
03:20:38,040 --> 03:20:39,420
Oh, I got a lot of points.

3025
03:20:42,740 --> 03:20:54,200
actually I wonder if it does make me it does want me to go
back probably because it probably wants me to go back

3026
03:20:54,200 --> 03:21:04,780
because there were like several doors so you know what let's
just go back 31st zone I probably have so many lives now but

3027
03:21:04,780 --> 03:21:15,040
if I think I fall I completely lose oh my god I completely
lose my invincibility why are you oh it's getting stuck on

3028
03:21:15,040 --> 03:21:17,600
these guys stop i'm trying to open the second door

3029
03:21:22,280 --> 03:21:23,080
42nd zone

3030
03:22:15,700 --> 03:22:19,040
get trolled i guess i

3031
03:22:25,400 --> 03:22:32,280
don't even know if i could be mad i don't even know if i
could be mad Oh, whoops.

3032
03:22:32,920 --> 03:22:36,500
I changed it, but I don't even know if I can be angry.

3033
03:22:44,610 --> 03:22:45,410
Are you mad, Mint?

3034
03:22:45,590 --> 03:22:46,650
I don't think so.

3035
03:22:47,090 --> 03:22:51,110
I think I'm really sad that I have to go through Zone 10
again.

3036
03:22:52,810 --> 03:22:55,390
I think I'm just more sad that I have to go through.

3037
03:22:55,610 --> 03:22:57,770
How do I find?

3038
03:23:00,090 --> 03:23:02,150
Okay, we're gonna have to find door floor.

3039
03:23:04,710 --> 03:23:05,150
Okay.

3040
03:23:05,170 --> 03:23:06,050
When we...

3041
03:23:06,050 --> 03:23:08,470
If I get past Zone...

3042
03:23:08,470 --> 03:23:13,190
If I can get past Zone 10, I have to find the...

3043
03:23:13,190 --> 03:23:13,730
Oh my god.

3044
03:23:13,990 --> 03:23:14,690
Damn it.

3045
03:23:15,890 --> 03:23:18,470
Was this game made by Millennium Game Development?

3046
03:23:23,110 --> 03:23:25,610
The rage refuses to manifest.

3047
03:23:26,410 --> 03:23:26,750
Yeah.

3048
03:23:30,750 --> 03:23:32,710
Actually, I think I kind of want to start over.

3049
03:23:34,370 --> 03:23:36,870
I think I want to start over with all seven lives.

3050
03:23:37,810 --> 03:23:38,370
I...

3051
03:23:38,390 --> 03:23:40,430
I want to start over with all seven lives.

3052
03:23:40,570 --> 03:23:42,190
I want to start over with all seven lives.

3053
03:23:44,990 --> 03:23:45,850
Punished, Binto.

3054
03:23:46,830 --> 03:23:47,790
What's the goal in this game?

3055
03:23:48,290 --> 03:23:51,390
To discover the mystery of Atlantis.

3056
03:23:52,650 --> 03:23:53,750
Atlantis no Nazo.

3057
03:23:58,630 --> 03:24:05,370
Oh, I cannot believe that there was three doors.

3058
03:24:06,110 --> 03:24:08,370
And one of them was just a black hole that...

3059
03:24:08,390 --> 03:24:10,770
Stole all of my lives.

3060
03:24:11,130 --> 03:24:13,510
I mean, I can believe it.

3061
03:24:14,070 --> 03:24:20,390
I'm gonna skip over that so that I don't accidentally get an
extra life.

3062
03:24:22,810 --> 03:24:24,450
Okay, alright.

3063
03:24:28,030 --> 03:24:30,690
Atlantis truly is a mysterious place.

3064
03:24:30,990 --> 03:24:33,430
Why did they build a door that leads to your death?

3065
03:24:39,220 --> 03:24:40,580
Oh, oh my god, I'm playing.

3066
03:24:40,800 --> 03:24:41,120
Oh my god.

3067
03:24:41,340 --> 03:24:42,140
Okay, actually

3068
03:24:46,160 --> 03:24:47,060
Oh, that was close.

3069
03:24:47,400 --> 03:24:54,300
Okay, I wanted to grab that so we get a little extra bonus
score for when we want to get an extra life.

3070
03:24:57,080 --> 03:25:05,120
I don't remember how much you need for an extra life, but
every little bit helps, I think.

3071
03:25:06,780 --> 03:25:07,620
Oh, oh my god.

3072
03:25:08,500 --> 03:25:09,880
Wait, no, no, no, I am going through here.

3073
03:25:10,000 --> 03:25:10,320
I forgot.

3074
03:25:11,780 --> 03:25:12,140
Oh.

3075
03:25:12,160 --> 03:25:13,840
All the doors lead to your death, boss.

3076
03:25:14,460 --> 03:25:18,960
Where would it have gone if we hadn't gone through that one?

3077
03:25:20,700 --> 03:25:22,200
And I even opened the first one.

3078
03:25:22,360 --> 03:25:23,240
I'm such an idiot.

3079
03:25:23,400 --> 03:25:23,800
God.

3080
03:25:25,540 --> 03:25:26,700
I'm such an idiot.

3081
03:25:26,820 --> 03:25:30,040
And I got like a million points from the last door.

3082
03:25:35,970 --> 03:25:38,730
And of course I was so excited about getting through.

3083
03:25:39,810 --> 03:25:45,230
I mean, of course, who would have, you know, I think anybody
would have thought that that door led to...

3084
03:25:45,250 --> 03:25:47,950
to level 4, probably.

3085
03:25:49,810 --> 03:25:52,750
If they passed zone 10, I imagine.

3086
03:25:53,890 --> 03:25:54,810
Third zone!

3087
03:25:57,170 --> 03:25:58,050
Okay.

3088
03:25:59,770 --> 03:26:00,350
Feesh.

3089
03:26:06,080 --> 03:26:06,920
Feesh.

3090
03:26:10,980 --> 03:26:11,860
Feesh.

3091
03:26:14,520 --> 03:26:16,140
Wait, it's this one.

3092
03:26:16,340 --> 03:26:18,580
Sorry, I got a little confused.

3093
03:26:19,020 --> 03:26:20,780
Okay, okay, okay.

3094
03:26:25,510 --> 03:26:25,830
Please.

3095
03:26:27,110 --> 03:26:27,830
Eighth zone.

3096
03:26:28,610 --> 03:26:29,730
Alright, here's where we struggle.

3097
03:26:30,910 --> 03:26:31,690
That's okay though.

3098
03:26:34,830 --> 03:26:35,830
I am stronger.

3099
03:26:36,810 --> 03:26:39,270
I am not the same mint I was.

3100
03:26:40,150 --> 03:26:40,670
20.

3101
03:26:41,050 --> 03:26:41,390
Nay.

3102
03:26:41,990 --> 03:26:42,390
30.

3103
03:26:42,910 --> 03:26:43,210
Nay.

3104
03:26:43,830 --> 03:26:44,850
An hour ago.

3105
03:26:45,570 --> 03:26:46,510
I have learned.

3106
03:26:47,630 --> 03:26:48,610
I have grown.

3107
03:26:49,590 --> 03:26:51,350
I have nazoed.

3108
03:26:53,890 --> 03:26:56,930
Oh my, okay, first of all, that didn't affect him.

3109
03:26:57,170 --> 03:27:01,630
Second of all, I'm very happy that I didn't die, but why did
that not affect him?

3110
03:27:02,450 --> 03:27:04,890
Why did he not go into his little shell?

3111
03:27:05,270 --> 03:27:05,810
Oh, wait.

3112
03:27:06,090 --> 03:27:07,370
Actually, I want him to go.

3113
03:27:08,230 --> 03:27:08,650
There we go.

3114
03:27:10,210 --> 03:27:11,170
Um, why?

3115
03:27:12,270 --> 03:27:13,590
He fears nothing.

3116
03:27:15,110 --> 03:27:16,970
Okay, here's this part.

3117
03:27:17,650 --> 03:27:18,850
We need you to go away.

3118
03:27:19,010 --> 03:27:19,910
Thank you.

3119
03:27:24,050 --> 03:27:26,210
And we need you to go away, thank you.

3120
03:27:28,290 --> 03:27:30,650
And we need you to go away.

3121
03:27:31,570 --> 03:27:31,890
Thank.

3122
03:27:39,890 --> 03:27:41,630
I really thought I had it.

3123
03:27:41,970 --> 03:27:43,430
I really thought I had it.

3124
03:27:43,510 --> 03:27:45,790
Clutch bomb, but I really thought I had it.

3125
03:27:46,290 --> 03:27:47,090
I thought so.

3126
03:27:47,350 --> 03:27:48,410
I thought I had it.

3127
03:27:54,690 --> 03:27:55,210
Thank.

3128
03:28:04,700 --> 03:28:08,680
I do want to thank this game for testing my patience.

3129
03:28:09,200 --> 03:28:11,820
Giving me a new appreciation on Afterlife.

3130
03:28:13,680 --> 03:28:14,400
Thank you, game.

3131
03:28:17,080 --> 03:28:21,920
To whoever created this game, I hope you know that you
have...

3132
03:28:21,920 --> 03:28:23,920
There's a very special place in hell for you.

3133
03:28:30,620 --> 03:28:32,600
Oh my gosh, I'm so...

3134
03:28:33,600 --> 03:28:35,220
I'm so scared of this part!

3135
03:28:35,760 --> 03:28:37,460
Oh my gosh, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3136
03:28:37,940 --> 03:28:38,960
Okay, there we go.

3137
03:28:39,160 --> 03:28:39,400
Okay.

3138
03:28:39,880 --> 03:28:40,440
There we go.

3139
03:28:40,560 --> 03:28:41,000
There we go.

3140
03:28:41,220 --> 03:28:41,720
There we go.

3141
03:28:41,820 --> 03:28:42,480
There we go.

3142
03:28:45,220 --> 03:28:46,120
Okay, all right.

3143
03:28:47,100 --> 03:28:48,500
Oh my gosh, am I gonna make it?

3144
03:28:48,920 --> 03:28:49,580
Do I have enough time?

3145
03:28:49,760 --> 03:28:51,120
Oh my God, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

3146
03:28:55,470 --> 03:28:56,790
Okay, oh my God.

3147
03:29:01,690 --> 03:29:03,590
Okay, we have six lives.

3148
03:29:05,150 --> 03:29:05,870
Not bad.

3149
03:29:18,230 --> 03:29:18,590
Okay.

3150
03:29:23,780 --> 03:29:25,740
In fact, I am gonna grab that.

3151
03:29:26,740 --> 03:29:27,800
Maybe get an extra life.

3152
03:29:27,960 --> 03:29:30,160
I don't know if it does or not.

3153
03:29:38,010 --> 03:29:38,550
No!

3154
03:29:42,770 --> 03:29:43,410
Ugh!

3155
03:29:48,130 --> 03:29:48,770
Ugh!

3156
03:29:56,000 --> 03:29:56,640
Ugh!

3157
03:30:06,640 --> 03:30:07,280
Ugh!

3158
03:30:07,280 --> 03:30:07,700
That's fine.

3159
03:30:08,720 --> 03:30:09,420
That's fine.

3160
03:30:10,260 --> 03:30:10,980
Oh god!

3161
03:30:11,160 --> 03:30:11,480
Ugh!

3162
03:30:11,900 --> 03:30:12,200
Ugh!

3163
03:30:12,320 --> 03:30:13,300
That's fine!

3164
03:30:13,300 --> 03:30:13,480
Ugh!

3165
03:30:15,060 --> 03:30:16,360
Jump King No Nazo.

3166
03:30:17,300 --> 03:30:19,100
There's a second door to the eighth stage, remember?

3167
03:30:21,060 --> 03:30:21,910
What about it?

3168
03:30:27,940 --> 03:30:28,710
What about it?

3169
03:30:31,500 --> 03:30:32,580
Oh my god!

3170
03:30:37,360 --> 03:30:39,400
You can grab the star and go back.

3171
03:30:42,380 --> 03:30:43,320
Where did the...

3172
03:30:43,320 --> 03:30:44,680
Where did that stage lead to?

3173
03:30:44,740 --> 03:30:45,720
I actually don't remember.

3174
03:30:49,400 --> 03:30:50,440
No, that went to Nazo.

3175
03:30:50,460 --> 03:30:51,400
Nagoya, didn't it?

3176
03:30:52,880 --> 03:30:54,100
That went to Nagoya, didn't it?

3177
03:30:54,240 --> 03:30:55,620
Oh my god.

3178
03:31:07,210 --> 03:31:07,670
Oh yeah!

3179
03:31:11,210 --> 03:31:11,690
Hoi!

3180
03:31:13,230 --> 03:31:13,490
Hoi!

3181
03:31:14,670 --> 03:31:15,070
Hoi!

3182
03:31:16,230 --> 03:31:16,570
Hoi!

3183
03:31:19,690 --> 03:31:20,290
Hoi!

3184
03:31:21,750 --> 03:31:22,430
Hoi!

3185
03:31:24,010 --> 03:31:24,690
Hoi!

3186
03:31:29,410 --> 03:31:30,510
Huy!

3187
03:31:32,110 --> 03:31:32,370
Huy!

3188
03:31:36,210 --> 03:31:36,710
Huy!

3189
03:31:37,750 --> 03:31:38,270
Huy!

3190
03:31:41,370 --> 03:31:42,470
Huy!

3191
03:31:42,990 --> 03:31:43,090
Huy!

3192
03:31:43,090 --> 03:31:43,930
Huy!

3193
03:31:43,930 --> 03:31:44,010
Huy!

3194
03:31:44,710 --> 03:31:45,810
Huy!

3195
03:31:48,910 --> 03:31:51,390
Where's the secret door?

3196
03:31:51,610 --> 03:31:52,830
Where's the other door?

3197
03:31:53,850 --> 03:31:56,210
I can't go anywhere else!

3198
03:31:57,310 --> 03:31:58,910
No way!

3199
03:32:00,490 --> 03:32:02,670
No, no, no, no, no.

3200
03:32:08,170 --> 03:32:09,630
Pause the game.

3201
03:32:15,810 --> 03:32:17,210
Does this lead to four?

3202
03:32:21,720 --> 03:32:23,060
Okay, I'm going to check.

3203
03:32:24,020 --> 03:32:26,800
It is four that I need to go to.

3204
03:32:28,280 --> 03:32:30,160
Yes, ten to four.

3205
03:32:31,260 --> 03:32:32,560
Ten to four.

3206
03:32:32,660 --> 03:32:33,980
You're up soon.

3207
03:32:36,900 --> 03:32:37,980
Thanks, Amore!

3208
03:32:38,620 --> 03:32:42,820
She's grunting like that because she's actually jumping in
her room as she plays.

3209
03:32:47,290 --> 03:32:48,890
This goes to 12.

3210
03:32:56,130 --> 03:32:57,930
We don't have so much time, you guys.

3211
03:32:58,990 --> 03:32:59,130
Wait.

3212
03:33:01,770 --> 03:33:04,790
You might be wondering, what the heck are you doing, Minto?

3213
03:33:05,490 --> 03:33:06,690
I'm gonna go back.

3214
03:33:10,690 --> 03:33:11,690
I'm gonna go back.

3215
03:33:18,330 --> 03:33:19,190
Do I have to...

3216
03:33:19,190 --> 03:33:19,790
I'm scared.

3217
03:33:20,310 --> 03:33:21,350
Do I have to bomb myself?

3218
03:33:21,370 --> 03:33:22,210
in front of the door?

3219
03:33:23,430 --> 03:33:23,910
Or somewhere?

3220
03:33:25,630 --> 03:33:27,610
Do I have to die to a bomb somewhere?

3221
03:33:28,670 --> 03:33:29,030
Hmm.

3222
03:33:31,450 --> 03:33:33,370
I don't think it's...

3223
03:33:37,690 --> 03:33:38,870
No, no, no.

3224
03:33:42,190 --> 03:33:43,750
Oh my god!

3225
03:33:45,350 --> 03:33:46,830
Oh my god.

3226
03:33:50,750 --> 03:33:52,130
Okay, I have to go.

Jump!

3230
03:34:32,310 --> 03:34:34,470
Alright, now, hold on, sorry, I don't mean to pause again.

3231
03:34:34,670 --> 03:34:39,810
I'm looking for, I'm looking for door 25, 25.

3232
03:34:40,270 --> 03:34:41,290
I wish these were labeled.

3233
03:34:43,150 --> 03:34:45,590
25, 25, 25.

3234
03:34:46,450 --> 03:34:46,650
Hoi!

3235
03:34:49,930 --> 03:34:50,490
Seven!

3236
03:34:54,790 --> 03:34:55,910
Time to go back.

3237
03:34:57,790 --> 03:34:58,410
Leave me alone.

3238
03:34:59,530 --> 03:35:00,090
Okay.

3239
03:35:00,090 --> 03:35:02,090
Leave me alone!

3240
03:35:09,090 --> 03:35:09,930
Seven.

3241
03:35:11,350 --> 03:35:13,250
Okay, keep on searching.

3242
03:35:17,910 --> 03:35:21,010
Okay, it's gonna be around here somewhere.

3243
03:35:22,890 --> 03:35:24,290
Here!

3244
03:35:25,250 --> 03:35:25,810
Third!

3245
03:35:39,540 --> 03:35:39,920
Four.

3246
03:35:44,400 --> 03:35:45,200
Um...

3247
03:35:45,400 --> 03:35:47,960
Is there anything over there?

3248
03:35:50,500 --> 03:35:52,360
If I jump...

3249
03:35:52,360 --> 03:35:55,520
If I jump...

3250
03:35:55,520 --> 03:35:57,700
Oh...

3251
03:35:57,700 --> 03:35:59,400
Oh...

3252
03:36:06,460 --> 03:36:09,660

I lost my...

3258
03:37:05,980 --> 03:37:06,800

3259
03:37:06,880 --> 03:37:07,620
Are you an invincibility?

3260
03:37:08,280 --> 03:37:12,120
Well, well, I mean...

3261
03:37:12,120 --> 03:37:14,220
We're closer to...

3262
03:37:14,220 --> 03:37:18,220
Okay, one, two, three, six, eight, ten, four.

3263
03:37:20,300 --> 03:37:20,760
Um...

3264
03:37:20,760 --> 03:37:22,560
One, two, three, no, four, five, six, seven.

3265
03:37:23,020 --> 03:37:24,260
One, two, three, four, five.

3266
03:37:24,360 --> 03:37:26,820
On this route, we only have five more levels.

3267
03:37:26,840 --> 03:37:41,760
left so i think we're we're over halfway there and i can get
past level 10 now so i think that's that is a win in my book

3268
03:37:41,760 --> 03:37:43,000
quite honestly

3269
03:37:50,220 --> 03:37:54,680
it's only been it's only been four hours we're fine

3270
03:38:04,640 --> 03:38:05,960
I'm starting to get hungry though.

3271
03:38:06,920 --> 03:38:08,640
But I have some food that I can...

3272
03:38:11,320 --> 03:38:11,880
What?!

3273
03:38:11,880 --> 03:38:13,640
I threw the bomb!

3274
03:38:16,840 --> 03:38:17,400
You!

3275
03:38:17,880 --> 03:38:20,480
This is where I should not be losing lives at!

3276
03:38:21,980 --> 03:38:23,160
Okay, I'm gonna start over.

3277
03:38:24,840 --> 03:38:26,320
I'm gonna start over.

3278
03:38:27,320 --> 03:38:28,160
I'm gonna start over.

3279
03:38:30,180 --> 03:38:31,600
Just kill me.

3280
03:38:33,180 --> 03:38:34,340
Rage meter 0%

3281
03:38:53,120 --> 03:38:55,160
Is the rage meter broken?

3282
03:38:55,520 --> 03:38:56,560
No, I don't think so.

3283
03:38:57,100 --> 03:38:57,720
Beep, beep, beep.

3284
03:38:58,440 --> 03:38:58,660
No.

3285
03:39:01,830 --> 03:39:06,710
I think I'm at rage 5%.

3286
03:39:08,630 --> 03:39:10,690
Just because of that one snail.

3287
03:39:12,450 --> 03:39:13,590
Really grind my gears.

3288
03:39:16,210 --> 03:39:16,410
Yeah.

3289
03:39:20,150 --> 03:39:20,590
Okay.

3290
03:39:21,310 --> 03:39:22,970
You can reset the game from the Switch menu.

3291
03:39:23,150 --> 03:39:25,090
I'm trying to pretend I'm not on the Switch.

3292
03:39:26,970 --> 03:39:29,010
I'm trying to be like...

3293
03:39:29,010 --> 03:39:31,830
Look at me playing Famicom game.

3294
03:39:34,250 --> 03:39:36,670
So just pretend you don't see the Switch menu on the bottom,
okay?

3295
03:39:37,410 --> 03:39:37,970
Just pretend.

3296
03:39:41,010 --> 03:39:41,270
Oh.

3297
03:39:42,270 --> 03:39:42,690
Oh!

3298
03:39:44,370 --> 03:39:45,250
Minto gaming!

3299
03:40:01,130 --> 03:40:02,610
I'm gonna go get some food.

3300
03:40:03,050 --> 03:40:04,070
I'll be right back.

3301
03:40:04,930 --> 03:40:06,110
I'll be right back.

3302
03:40:10,090 --> 03:40:13,230
I'll be, I'll be like a second because I don't have to heat
it up.

3303
03:40:13,390 --> 03:40:16,170
It's just some like some cheese and crackers and stuff.

3304
03:40:16,310 --> 03:40:17,430
So I'll be right back.

3305
03:41:51,750 --> 03:41:52,630
I'm back.

3306
03:41:52,950 --> 03:41:53,410
I'm back.

3307
03:41:53,990 --> 03:41:54,610
I'm back.

3308
03:41:54,610 --> 03:41:55,070
Welcome back.

3309
03:41:55,150 --> 03:41:58,490
We're gonna have a short, we're gonna have a short
intermission.

3310
03:41:58,950 --> 03:42:03,070
The short, short intermission.

3311
03:42:04,870 --> 03:42:06,410
So I can, so I can eat.

3312
03:42:06,970 --> 03:42:11,610
So I'm gonna just turn this off so we don't have to listen
to it.

3313
03:42:13,450 --> 03:42:15,770
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3314
03:42:16,030 --> 03:42:17,310
And I got, oh my gosh.

3315
03:42:17,730 --> 03:42:19,630
I got some of my favorite cake last night.

3316
03:42:22,490 --> 03:42:24,590
So I am gonna eat some of that for you.

3317
03:42:25,350 --> 03:42:25,930
energy.

3318
03:42:27,190 --> 03:42:30,410
And I have some chicken salad and some crackers.

3319
03:42:30,830 --> 03:42:31,570
I mean, not crackers.

3320
03:42:32,130 --> 03:42:33,130
I thought they were crackers.

3321
03:42:33,450 --> 03:42:36,230
It's some bread.

3322
03:42:37,830 --> 03:42:38,670
And some cheese.

3323
03:42:40,090 --> 03:42:41,210
And some grapes.

3324
03:42:43,970 --> 03:42:45,350
Rage reducing cake.

3325
03:42:45,430 --> 03:42:46,590
It's my favorite cake ever.

3326
03:42:48,810 --> 03:42:49,670
It's so delicious.

3327
03:42:50,850 --> 03:42:52,290
But it's from a specific store.

3328
03:42:52,610 --> 03:42:57,110
So if I like ever move away, I'll never be able to get it
again, you know?

3329
03:42:58,990 --> 03:43:00,850
It might be one of the only things keeping me here.

3330
03:43:05,030 --> 03:43:11,550
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm,
mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

3331
03:43:11,550 --> 03:43:14,610
Maybe, actually, I'm gonna turn on some music, so I'm not
just...

3332
03:43:17,290 --> 03:43:17,690
Eating.

3333
03:43:19,110 --> 03:43:21,810
Oh, this is, this song is called Lemon Cake.

3334
03:43:22,250 --> 03:43:22,990
How, how fitting.

3335
03:43:24,610 --> 03:43:25,670
Oh my god, it's loud though.

3336
03:43:30,650 --> 03:43:30,690
Yummy.

3337
03:43:34,830 --> 03:43:39,810
Just a short little five-minute break for me to eat.

3338
03:43:41,490 --> 03:43:42,330
I could barely open this.

3339
03:43:42,430 --> 03:43:44,910
My hands are starting to shake because of the caffeine.

3340
03:43:46,930 --> 03:43:49,670
And also, it's hard to open things anyway when you're a
ghost.

3341
03:43:50,790 --> 03:43:54,250
Oh, boom.

3342
03:44:01,860 --> 03:44:08,860
you know I'm proud of how much progress I've made so far
especially with stage 10 I was really thinking it would be

3343
03:44:08,860 --> 03:44:23,980
impossible and I've done it twice now so all in all good
you've honestly made it pretty far into the game and like

3344
03:44:23,980 --> 03:44:36,140
it's been four hours but we've tried different route so
platforming pretty well yippee you're accidentally taking

3345
03:44:36,140 --> 03:44:42,100
wrong routes more exploration so that's nice yeah exactly do

It's horrible.

3349
03:45:12,390 --> 03:45:13,110
Oh,

3350
03:45:22,890 --> 03:45:23,450
the music's off.

3351
03:45:23,510 --> 03:45:24,090
There's just something.

3352
03:45:25,210 --> 03:45:26,310
Wait, Cheetah Man is unfinished?

3353
03:45:27,150 --> 03:45:29,310
Oh, yeah.

3354
03:45:29,310 --> 03:45:29,690
Uh-oh.

3355
03:45:32,210 --> 03:45:39,330
is on the other screen the one that's being occupied by the
game so okay I got it though

3356
03:45:43,460 --> 03:45:47,160
I recommend Bugs Bunny birthday blowout for NES oh

center CX greatest hits and play Quest of Key sometime yeah

3358
03:46:10,000 --> 03:46:23,420

better gamer you must start at the basics and honestly this

3359
03:46:23,420 --> 03:46:39,720

so unfair and so so um I guess unfair something is so unfair

a gamer.

Don't forget your skills as a gamer.

03:46:51,460 --> 03:46:52,520
So Mario next?

3363
03:47:05,640 --> 03:47:07,520
I don't like Mario.

3364
03:47:08,340 --> 03:47:09,220
I'm tired.

3365
03:47:15,030 --> 03:47:16,530

Here's some cool story while you listen.

3375
03:48:45,230 --> 03:48:48,530
I just finished Fallout 1, a very old CRPG game back in the
community.

3376
03:48:49,070 --> 03:48:53,210
It was a rough experience, so since I lost my progress
yesterday, I had to play my older save.

3377
03:48:53,370 --> 03:48:54,130
It frustrated me, though.

3378
03:48:54,370 --> 03:48:54,750
But it's fine.

3379
03:48:55,230 --> 03:48:55,650
Congrats on...

3380
03:48:55,650 --> 03:48:56,350
You finished it.

3381
03:48:56,470 --> 03:48:56,770
Congrats!

3382
03:49:00,890 --> 03:49:05,870
I have been watching, I think because of the Fallout show.

3383
03:49:15,390 --> 03:49:27,650
Because of the show I've seen a lot more videos about
Fallout And it'll be like Creepy as Fallout Bunker And some

3384
03:49:27,650 --> 03:49:34,130
of them are like Some of them have like intrigued me enough
To where I'm like now I'm really interested in playing I

3385
03:49:34,130 --> 03:49:35,210
don't know if I'll stream it though

3386
03:49:40,400 --> 03:49:41,780
Fallout 1 is fantastic.

3387
03:49:43,820 --> 03:49:44,920
Oh yeah, the vaults, that's what I meant.

3388
03:49:45,060 --> 03:49:45,960
That's what, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3389
03:49:46,500 --> 03:49:52,920
They're just like, this vault was creepy because it was an
experiment to see how people reacted if this and this

3390
03:49:52,920 --> 03:49:53,360
happened.

3391
03:49:53,580 --> 03:49:54,440
And I'm like, whoa!

3392
03:50:01,510 --> 03:50:03,310
I would love to watch you play Fallout.

3393
03:50:04,090 --> 03:50:05,370
I know nothing about it.

3394
03:50:07,030 --> 03:50:09,470
Except only what I've heard from those videos.

3395
03:50:23,090 --> 03:50:29,470
you said you couldn't play single game without single player
game without chat though it's not that i can't it's just

3396
03:50:29,470 --> 03:50:35,590
more fun i find that i enjoy the game more when i when i um

3397
03:50:41,010 --> 03:50:49,710
when i play with the chat and you guys reacting and i was
having fun together that's why i feel with this I'm not

3398
03:50:49,710 --> 03:50:53,130

Oh, thank you.

3403

Oh, look at the haunting ground.

3404
03:51:24,950 --> 03:51:25,890
I think I've heard of that.

3405
03:51:26,710 --> 03:51:28,050
Oh my God.

3406
03:51:28,150 --> 03:51:30,750
Speaking of spooky maids, at Disney.

3407
03:51:33,450 --> 03:51:34,410
At Tokyo Disney.

3408
03:51:34,710 --> 03:51:43,690
I don't know if it's American Disney too, but for the
haunted house ride, they had Mickey Mouse ears that were...

3409
03:51:43,690 --> 03:51:47,390
I don't even actually know if they were just ears, but they
were...

3410
03:51:49,050 --> 03:51:56,790
The girls at the haunted mansion that run the ride, they're
dressed up as like ghost maids.

3411
03:51:57,490 --> 03:52:00,650
And they're just so cute and they have sold their headbands.

3412
03:52:01,210 --> 03:52:07,250
I don't know, I hope, I don't know if it was like, if they
sell it year round or if it was just a Halloween thing one

3413
03:52:07,250 --> 03:52:10,870
year, but I saw someone wearing one and it was so cute.

3414
03:52:11,530 --> 03:52:13,670
And I searched the park, but I couldn't find one.

3415
03:52:13,850 --> 03:52:15,710
But oh my gosh, it's really cute.

3416
03:52:16,250 --> 03:52:23,170
I search, I recommend, like look up the haunted house
Haunted Mansion maids at Tokyo Disney.

3417
03:52:25,510 --> 03:52:27,250
They're so cute!

3418
03:52:32,130 --> 03:52:33,810
They dress as the maids and butlers.

3419
03:52:34,010 --> 03:52:34,330
Oh, they do?

3420
03:52:36,470 --> 03:52:37,330
Might be the same then.

3421
03:52:37,530 --> 03:52:37,570
Okay.

3422
03:52:38,250 --> 03:52:39,010
I had one bite.

3423
03:52:39,110 --> 03:52:39,950
I'm having one other bite.

3424
03:52:40,230 --> 03:52:40,510
How?

3425
03:52:49,610 --> 03:52:51,130
Wait, I should go put this in the fridge.

3426
03:52:54,130 --> 03:52:58,290
I'm gonna go put this back in the fridge so it doesn't get
warm and melt.

3427
03:52:58,970 --> 03:53:00,070
Okay, I'll be right back.

3428
03:53:01,910 --> 03:53:02,930
Just a little bit.

3429
03:53:03,250 --> 03:53:04,650
Also, I'm gonna get more water, so.

3430
03:53:05,970 --> 03:53:07,090
I'll be right back one more time.

3431
03:53:07,170 --> 03:53:07,790
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

3432
03:54:03,590 --> 03:54:04,310
I'm back.

3433
03:54:05,170 --> 03:54:06,290
And I'm ready.

3434
03:54:07,830 --> 03:54:08,210
Range meter.

3435
03:54:10,330 --> 03:54:10,690
Decrease.

3436
03:54:11,470 --> 03:54:12,590
Peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep.

3437
03:54:12,730 --> 03:54:15,110
Calculating.

3438
03:54:15,390 --> 03:54:17,210
Calculating percent.

3439
03:54:19,170 --> 03:54:20,870
Four percent.

3440
03:54:22,810 --> 03:54:24,650
Three percent.

3441
03:54:27,130 --> 03:54:28,570
Two percent.

3442
03:54:35,230 --> 03:54:35,490
Alrighty.

3443
03:54:37,610 --> 03:54:38,010
Are we ready?

3444
03:54:48,630 --> 03:54:56,030
Now we know how to get to level 4 And from there we don't
know what we're doing But we will figure it out Because we

3445
03:54:56,030 --> 03:55:05,450
are super smart And we will get it right on the first first
try And we won't get it wrong And we also won't die Oh Okay

3446
03:55:15,890 --> 03:55:18,030
Yeah take that, take that.

3447
03:55:20,170 --> 03:55:22,170
that take the...

3448
03:55:29,610 --> 03:55:32,170
Is it weird to be having so much fun with this game?

3449
03:55:34,110 --> 03:55:36,530
And when it's supposed to be like a rage game?

3450
03:55:40,070 --> 03:55:42,130
Drop down, drop down.

3451
03:55:42,470 --> 03:55:43,210
There we go.

3452
03:55:44,330 --> 03:55:45,330
Better to be safe than sorry.

3453
03:55:47,070 --> 03:55:47,470
A little.

3454
03:55:48,930 --> 03:56:06,170
Maybe I have gone insane maybe i've got insane like fish

3455
03:56:09,510 --> 03:56:21,810

okay so i always knew that i couldn't burp It's this one,

3456
03:56:22,130 --> 03:56:22,130
right?

3457
03:56:22,710 --> 03:56:23,070
Yeah.

3458
03:56:23,470 --> 03:56:28,310
I always knew that I couldn't burp, but I recently learned
that there's a thing for it.

3459
03:56:30,010 --> 03:56:31,030
It's called like...

3460
03:56:31,030 --> 03:56:32,510
I don't remember what it's called actually.

3461
03:56:34,150 --> 03:56:35,770
But I can't burp.

3462
03:56:35,950 --> 03:56:38,770
I can only make a weird sound in my throat.

3463
03:56:40,030 --> 03:56:41,170
It's really weird.

3464
03:56:45,680 --> 03:56:46,140
Sorry.

3465
03:56:46,280 --> 03:56:50,000
I thought about it because it just happened where my throat
was like...

3466
03:56:51,100 --> 03:56:52,340
And I was like...

3467
03:56:52,340 --> 03:56:52,400
And I was like...

3468
03:56:53,460 --> 03:56:55,040
I learned that that's a thing.

3469
03:56:58,340 --> 03:57:00,820
I'm actually incapable of burping.

3470
03:57:02,060 --> 03:57:03,020
I've never burped once.

3471
03:57:03,360 --> 03:57:04,120
Maybe as a baby.

3472
03:57:04,700 --> 03:57:06,960
But I don't even know.

3473
03:57:06,960 --> 03:57:07,420
I try.

3474
03:57:07,960 --> 03:57:09,380
People will be like, just...

3475
03:57:09,380 --> 03:57:10,660
I don't even know how to do it.

3476
03:57:11,080 --> 03:57:11,900
They're like, try.

3477
03:57:12,040 --> 03:57:12,880
And I'm like, ah.

3478
03:57:13,700 --> 03:57:14,140
Ah.

3479
03:57:15,280 --> 03:57:16,320
Oh, my God.

3480
03:57:16,760 --> 03:57:18,620
I need to pay attention a little bit more.

3481
03:57:22,160 --> 03:57:24,040
Have you also ever tried screaming?

3482
03:57:24,060 --> 03:57:26,160
after you let all the air out of your body?

3483
03:57:48,870 --> 03:57:50,550
She's gonna pass out.

3484
03:58:06,510 --> 03:58:08,590
That was so unfair.

3485
03:58:10,930 --> 03:58:11,530
No!

3486
03:58:15,810 --> 03:58:17,530
I did everything!

3487
03:58:23,130 --> 03:58:24,690
Actually robbed.

3488
03:58:25,550 --> 03:58:26,470
Oh my goodness.

3489
03:58:27,150 --> 03:58:27,410
Nice.

3490
03:58:32,900 --> 03:58:34,620
Was it because...

3491
03:58:34,620 --> 03:58:35,240
Where did I...

3492
03:58:35,240 --> 03:58:35,900
Where did I...

3493
03:58:36,300 --> 03:58:40,800
I actually don't know where I took too long on, to be
honest.

3494
03:58:43,180 --> 03:58:44,920
Everything is starting to, like, blur together.

3495
03:58:45,220 --> 03:58:47,400
And it's just becoming muscle memory at this point.

3496
03:58:53,430 --> 03:58:54,470
Oh, I

3497
03:59:00,730 --> 03:59:03,290
hate level 8.

3498
03:59:05,750 --> 03:59:08,190
I think I hate this level more than I hate 10.

3499
03:59:10,410 --> 03:59:13,450
I think I hate this level more than I hate 10.

3500
03:59:15,030 --> 03:59:15,870
Honestly.

3501
03:59:33,280 --> 03:59:34,400
Okay, we made it here.

3502
03:59:47,960 --> 03:59:49,420
Please leave.

3503
04:00:06,630 --> 04:00:07,010
Okay.

3504
04:00:08,030 --> 04:00:09,130
Zone 10.

3505
04:00:11,910 --> 04:00:12,410
Okay.

3506
04:00:13,510 --> 04:00:13,970
Duh.

3507
04:00:14,650 --> 04:00:14,950
Duh.

3508
04:00:15,230 --> 04:00:15,970
Duh.

3509
04:00:16,350 --> 04:00:16,670
Duh.

3510
04:00:17,930 --> 04:00:18,190
Duh.

3511
04:00:18,470 --> 04:00:18,670
Duh.

3512
04:00:19,590 --> 04:00:21,150
All right, guys.

3513
04:00:22,430 --> 04:00:23,790
All right.

3514
04:00:23,790 --> 04:00:25,530
We can do this.

3515
04:00:30,560 --> 04:00:32,220
We can do this!

3516
04:00:39,810 --> 04:00:42,230
That's not what I wanted to do, but that works.

3517
04:00:45,310 --> 04:00:47,070
BGM that burns your brain.

3518
04:00:47,370 --> 04:00:51,850
There's like two soundtracks in this, two, two songs in this
game.

3519
04:01:00,090 --> 04:01:01,770
But we're getting better.

3520
04:01:02,890 --> 04:01:03,490
getting better.

3521
04:01:15,680 --> 04:01:15,960
No.

3522
04:01:16,500 --> 04:01:17,000
Oh.

3523
04:01:17,780 --> 04:01:19,200
Oh, oh my god.

3524
04:01:20,340 --> 04:01:21,080
Oh my god.

3525
04:01:22,180 --> 04:01:23,560
Oh, yeah.

3526
04:01:39,540 --> 04:01:41,800
I hate level 10.

3527
04:01:42,000 --> 04:01:44,160
I do hate level 8 more than 10, though.

3528
04:01:57,680 --> 04:02:19,280
I'm so good though will I run out of time now who knows I
think I did that relatively quickly though okay I think I

3529
04:02:19,280 --> 04:02:22,780
did that really Okay, so going to the third one is like
ideal.

3530
04:02:30,310 --> 04:02:32,330
I wanted to see if I could do it for the second one.

3531
04:02:33,610 --> 04:02:34,790
I wanted to see.

3532
04:02:36,490 --> 04:02:38,190
I wanted to see.

3533
04:02:39,010 --> 04:02:39,310
Sure.

3534
04:02:46,090 --> 04:02:47,530
Are you kidding me?

3535
04:02:50,610 --> 04:02:52,930
Are you kidding me right now?

3536
04:02:54,090 --> 04:02:54,410
Wow.

3537
04:02:57,390 --> 04:02:57,750
Oh.

3538
04:02:57,750 --> 04:03:00,150
Are you kidding me?

3539
04:03:03,090 --> 04:03:06,030
Please, Mr. John Atlantis.

3540
04:03:16,700 --> 04:03:20,740
Please, Mr. John Atlantis, just use your feet.

3541
04:03:21,100 --> 04:03:22,680
Grab it with your toes.

3542
04:03:25,800 --> 04:03:26,480
There we go.

3543
04:03:30,700 --> 04:03:31,540
Acquired.

3544
04:03:32,540 --> 04:03:34,360
Oh, that was close.

3545
04:03:37,780 --> 04:03:38,420
Okay.

3546
04:03:41,280 --> 04:03:41,600
Cloud.

3547
04:03:45,640 --> 04:03:46,060
Nice.

3548
04:03:46,420 --> 04:03:47,200
There we go.

3549
04:03:47,480 --> 04:03:47,900
There we go.

3550
04:03:48,060 --> 04:03:49,420
There we go.

3551
04:03:50,360 --> 04:03:52,420
Oh, I didn't think I was going to make that.

3552
04:03:57,320 --> 04:03:57,780
Eww.

3553
04:03:58,300 --> 04:03:58,400
Yippee!

3554
04:04:01,500 --> 04:04:02,140
Wrong.

3555
04:04:06,010 --> 04:04:06,490
Oh.

3556
04:04:06,850 --> 04:04:07,110
Actually.

3557
04:04:07,650 --> 04:04:08,090
Wait.

3558
04:04:08,750 --> 04:04:09,830
I have to go through here first.

3559
04:04:11,650 --> 04:04:12,990
I have to go through here first.

3560
04:04:17,110 --> 04:04:18,810
Do I have- Oh, I only have one life.

3561
04:04:19,790 --> 04:04:20,690
Oh, you guys!

3562
04:04:22,350 --> 04:04:23,310
You guys!

3563
04:04:24,330 --> 04:04:24,710
Oh.

3564
04:04:25,990 --> 04:04:27,270
This is not good.

3565
04:04:29,430 --> 04:04:31,470
This is not looking very good for me.

3566
04:04:31,630 --> 04:04:32,570
Okay, fourth zone!

3567
04:04:33,950 --> 04:04:38,070
Fourth zone, we're- we're- Okay, go this way instead.

3568
04:04:38,970 --> 04:04:39,710
Okay, okay.

3569
04:04:40,690 --> 04:04:42,290
No, no, okay.

3570
04:04:47,020 --> 04:04:48,800
I can make it with this, okay.

3571
04:05:13,840 --> 04:05:14,620
It's okay.

3572
04:05:15,860 --> 04:05:18,180
I know the secret for stage 10 now.

3573
04:05:20,760 --> 04:05:23,780
I know, I know how to get through stage 10 now.

3574
04:05:24,300 --> 04:05:29,160
And he has video games are proof that people used to need to
jump more to get around in their daily life.

3575
04:05:30,140 --> 04:05:32,820
Yes, this is historically accurate.

3576
04:05:38,060 --> 04:05:39,100
historically accurate.

3577
04:05:40,240 --> 04:05:40,520
Oh my god.

3578
04:05:40,740 --> 04:05:40,740
Wait.

3579
04:05:40,920 --> 04:05:41,960
Oh, that was close.

3580
04:05:44,100 --> 04:05:44,320
Wait.

3581
04:05:48,410 --> 04:05:49,650
Hey, get out of here.

3582
04:05:51,350 --> 04:05:51,410
Oh.

3583
04:05:52,510 --> 04:05:53,610
Alright, John Atlantis.

3584
04:05:55,950 --> 04:06:00,810
Claim your title as the one true Atlantis king.

3585
04:06:06,580 --> 04:06:07,900
Okay, this goes to three.

3586
04:06:10,080 --> 04:06:10,520
Three?

3587
04:06:10,780 --> 04:06:12,080
We go to Six.

3588
04:06:16,660 --> 04:06:18,100
Fish incoming!

3589
04:06:22,280 --> 04:06:23,720
Fish incoming!

3590
04:06:27,460 --> 04:06:29,280
We'll let this guy fall.

3591
04:06:31,400 --> 04:06:31,640
Wait.

3592
04:06:41,950 --> 04:06:43,830
Why is the fish from another direction?

3593
04:06:52,420 --> 04:06:55,300
I thought the fish was gonna be from another direction now.

3594
04:06:55,300 --> 04:06:59,200
I thought the fish was gonna be in another direction now!

3595
04:07:03,100 --> 04:07:03,980
Fish incoming!

3596
04:07:07,980 --> 04:07:08,660
Let him drop.

3597
04:07:10,080 --> 04:07:10,740
Fish incoming!

3598
04:07:15,110 --> 04:07:17,270
I'm gonna start throwing them the opposite direction.

3599
04:07:18,770 --> 04:07:20,310
I came up with that in my brain.

3600
04:07:20,530 --> 04:07:22,910
I was like, wait a second, why am I throwing it towards
them?

3601
04:07:22,990 --> 04:07:28,470
And then, like, risking myself getting blown up if they
stop, Oh!

3602
04:07:31,470 --> 04:07:33,150
Only four lives left.

3603
04:07:33,410 --> 04:07:35,490
Oh, this is so bad, you guys!

3604
04:07:37,490 --> 04:07:37,990
Please.

3605
04:07:38,850 --> 04:07:39,750
I need you.

3606
04:07:43,590 --> 04:07:45,530
Four lives left for level eight.

3607
04:07:46,370 --> 04:07:47,050
It's not good.

3608
04:07:47,270 --> 04:07:48,290
This is not looking good.

3609
04:07:50,250 --> 04:07:52,190
This is not looking good, you guys.

3610
04:07:52,490 --> 04:07:53,530
This is not looking good.

3611
04:08:06,210 --> 04:08:07,850
Once you get the star, it doesn't matter.

3612
04:08:07,950 --> 04:08:10,630
Anyway, it does matter if I can't jump either.

3613
04:08:12,530 --> 04:08:15,910
I tried throwing the bomb and, oh, okay.

3614
04:08:17,230 --> 04:08:17,930
Redo time.

3615
04:08:18,490 --> 04:08:19,330
It's time to redo.

3616
04:08:20,150 --> 04:08:22,030
It's time to redo, there's no way.

3617
04:08:26,710 --> 04:08:28,050
These are all practice runs.

3618
04:08:37,900 --> 04:08:40,300
Sometimes in life we regress a little bit.

3619
04:08:42,040 --> 04:08:42,720
Or in afterlife.

3620
04:08:44,140 --> 04:08:44,700
Okay.

3621
04:08:45,400 --> 04:08:45,560
Okay.

3622
04:08:45,880 --> 04:08:46,240
That's okay.

3623
04:08:46,360 --> 04:08:47,320
That was only stage 8.

3624
04:08:49,100 --> 04:08:51,000
8 out of 99, baby.

3625
04:08:54,380 --> 04:08:55,880
No worries here.

3626
04:08:56,860 --> 04:08:58,100
No worries here.

3627
04:08:59,660 --> 04:09:00,520
No worries here.

3628
04:09:03,140 --> 04:09:04,420
8 out of 99.

3629
04:09:06,000 --> 04:09:06,560
Pooh.

3630
04:09:09,180 --> 04:09:10,600
Should do this game for GDQ.

3631
04:09:11,200 --> 04:09:13,600
I would love to participate in a GDQ one day.

3632
04:09:13,940 --> 04:09:15,500
But like...

3633
04:09:16,500 --> 04:09:18,840
Oh god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

3634
04:09:19,300 --> 04:09:20,160
But I'm...

3635
04:09:20,160 --> 04:09:21,480
Me speedrunning anything?

3636
04:09:23,060 --> 04:09:24,260
I don't see that happening.

3637
04:09:36,850 --> 04:09:40,430
Maybe I could organize a VTubers games thing.

3638
04:09:41,490 --> 04:09:42,250
Oh my god, go, go, go!

3639
04:09:52,520 --> 04:09:54,260
I'm regressing right now.

3640
04:09:55,420 --> 04:09:56,420
Fish incoming!

3641
04:10:01,330 --> 04:10:02,370
Wait for the fish.

3642
04:10:02,510 --> 04:10:03,550
Fish incoming!

3643
04:10:04,370 --> 04:10:08,450
Let this guy die.

3644
04:10:09,110 --> 04:10:09,930
Fish incoming!

3645
04:10:14,690 --> 04:10:16,210
Fish incoming!

3646
04:10:19,430 --> 04:10:20,530
This one, right?

3647
04:10:21,150 --> 04:10:21,390
Yes.

3648
04:10:23,730 --> 04:10:25,830
Games done not so quick.

3649
04:10:29,330 --> 04:10:30,650
Oh

3650
04:10:38,070 --> 04:10:43,630
my gosh.

3651
04:10:44,170 --> 04:10:44,910
Come on, jump.

3652
04:10:51,420 --> 04:10:52,040
Please!

3653
04:10:53,060 --> 04:10:53,100
Please!

3654
04:10:53,100 --> 04:10:54,240
I am pressing A!

3655
04:10:54,520 --> 04:10:55,980
I am pressing A!

3656
04:10:57,680 --> 04:11:00,480
I think just, uh...

3657
04:11:00,480 --> 04:11:00,860
You know.

3658
04:11:02,380 --> 04:11:03,960
Oh, this is a lag!

3659
04:11:04,460 --> 04:11:05,060
No, I'm just kidding.

3660
04:11:09,650 --> 04:11:10,250
Oh, please.

3661
04:11:17,070 --> 04:11:17,510
Okay.

3662
04:11:18,890 --> 04:11:19,450
Okay.

3663
04:11:22,310 --> 04:11:22,930
Yeah!

3664
04:11:23,630 --> 04:11:23,930
Okay.

3665
04:11:24,750 --> 04:11:26,010
I'll let this guy go.

3666
04:11:39,050 --> 04:11:41,090
Please, please, I need to speed.

3667
04:11:43,550 --> 04:11:45,690
Oh gosh, I thought I was going to land in there.

3668
04:11:48,050 --> 04:11:48,690
First try, baby!

3669
04:11:51,230 --> 04:11:51,630
Yeah!

3670
04:12:02,030 --> 04:12:10,290
I knew that was, I knew I, I knew, I knew at the moment that
I had gotten too far.

3671
04:12:10,970 --> 04:12:12,150
I knew it, I knew it.

3672
04:12:13,450 --> 04:12:16,570
Oh, I knew in the moment.

3673
04:12:40,030 --> 04:12:40,350
What the?

3674
04:12:47,410 --> 04:12:48,450
Do points matter?

3675
04:12:49,170 --> 04:12:52,430
I believe if you get enough points, you get an extra life.

3676
04:12:55,070 --> 04:12:57,750
So, it is good to have.

3677
04:12:58,270 --> 04:12:59,850
It's good to get them when you can.

3678
04:13:01,710 --> 04:13:02,670
Yes, indeed.

3679
04:13:15,900 --> 04:13:18,080
There we go.

3680
04:13:19,520 --> 04:13:20,960
Yes, yes, yes.

3681
04:13:31,480 --> 04:13:32,000
Oh, wait.

3682
04:13:33,000 --> 04:13:33,540
My bad.

3683
04:13:35,360 --> 04:13:35,540
Okay.

3684
04:13:36,300 --> 04:13:38,980
Alright, alright, alrighty, alrighty.

3685
04:13:40,000 --> 04:13:40,380
Okay.

3686
04:13:45,930 --> 04:13:46,570
Okay.

3687
04:13:46,830 --> 04:13:48,250
F you chest.

3688
04:13:54,290 --> 04:13:54,930
Okay.

3689
04:14:01,900 --> 04:14:02,300
All right.

3690
04:14:03,180 --> 04:14:09,120
Um, I think, uh, this is like the safest way to get down.

3691
04:14:10,360 --> 04:14:10,580
Ha!

3692
04:14:11,220 --> 04:14:11,860
Oh!

3693
04:14:12,220 --> 04:14:13,040
Okay, okay.

3694
04:14:15,420 --> 04:14:18,260
It's the safest, it's the actually safest way to get down.

3695
04:14:19,500 --> 04:14:20,140
No!

3696
04:14:21,960 --> 04:14:23,300
I didn't.

3697
04:14:23,500 --> 04:14:26,020
I didn't jump soon enough.

3698
04:14:29,930 --> 04:14:30,290
Sure.

3699
04:14:32,590 --> 04:14:34,290
I lost the star!

3700
04:14:36,870 --> 04:14:38,850
I have to redo everything.

3701
04:14:50,590 --> 04:14:51,970
I have to redo everything.

3702
04:14:54,510 --> 04:14:54,870
Oh!

3703
04:15:00,610 --> 04:15:02,370
Oh yeah.

3704
04:15:02,390 --> 04:15:03,510
I'm gonna die here.

3705
04:15:04,190 --> 04:15:04,790
Maybe.

3706
04:15:05,250 --> 04:15:05,950
Actually, I don't.

3707
04:15:06,430 --> 04:15:07,730
Are you coming over here or what?

3708
04:15:12,320 --> 04:15:13,840
Keep pushing forward.

3709
04:15:15,060 --> 04:15:15,380
You know what?

3710
04:15:15,460 --> 04:15:17,240
Maybe I can try...

3711
04:15:17,240 --> 04:15:17,420
Oops.

3712
04:15:18,800 --> 04:15:19,140
Dang it.

3713
04:15:19,800 --> 04:15:26,100
Maybe I can try level four without infinity to see...

3714
04:15:29,020 --> 04:15:30,220
To see...

3715
04:15:30,220 --> 04:15:32,880
But we need infinity for the last level.

3716
04:15:33,000 --> 04:15:34,420
But we can see where the next...

3717
04:15:34,420 --> 04:15:36,060
Where the door is, you know what I mean?

3718
04:15:39,220 --> 04:15:41,060
Where the door is to the next part?

3719
04:15:41,960 --> 04:15:43,180
Maybe, if we're good.

3720
04:15:45,080 --> 04:15:47,620
So let's at least try.

3721
04:15:51,790 --> 04:15:54,010
I don't know where the... duck!

3722
04:15:55,390 --> 04:15:55,690
Duck!

3723
04:16:02,550 --> 04:16:02,730
Duck!

3724
04:16:03,470 --> 04:16:05,840
Oh no!

3725
04:16:06,140 --> 04:16:07,260
Oh my god, oh my god!

3726
04:16:18,540 --> 04:16:19,080
Gaming.

3727
04:16:23,870 --> 04:16:24,250
Gaming.

3728
04:16:27,230 --> 04:16:28,350
It's right here!

3729
04:16:40,870 --> 04:16:41,630
Oh god.

3730
04:16:47,150 --> 04:16:47,910
This part.

3731
04:16:48,430 --> 04:16:48,890
Um, hello?

3732
04:16:49,070 --> 04:16:50,190
I don't think this is possible.

3733
04:16:51,950 --> 04:16:53,390
Oh my gosh, I made it.

3734
04:16:53,730 --> 04:16:54,390
Okay, okay.

3735
04:17:00,370 --> 04:17:01,710
So it's just a few over.

3736
04:17:02,370 --> 04:17:03,910
As long as I can make the jump.

3737
04:17:04,890 --> 04:17:06,290
Oh duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck!

3738
04:17:06,430 --> 04:17:06,970
Oh my god!

3739
04:17:06,990 --> 04:17:12,370
I jumped too late?

3740
04:17:14,890 --> 04:17:16,170
Oh, gosh.

3741
04:17:25,330 --> 04:17:29,350
I'm surprised I made that other part, though.

3742
04:17:32,870 --> 04:17:33,730
There we go.

3743
04:17:35,490 --> 04:17:35,790
Duck.

3744
04:17:36,590 --> 04:17:37,150
Not duck.

3745
04:17:38,470 --> 04:17:39,330
But...

3746
04:17:41,090 --> 04:17:41,570
Ooh!

3747
04:17:42,470 --> 04:17:43,770
Oh my gosh, that was so close.

3748
04:17:56,230 --> 04:17:56,710
Quack.

3749
04:17:57,810 --> 04:17:58,690
What is this area?

3750
04:18:00,370 --> 04:18:01,330
30th zone?

3751
04:18:02,490 --> 04:18:03,990
I don't know where I'm supposed to be at.

3752
04:18:05,110 --> 04:18:05,650
Wait, hold on.

3753
04:18:06,230 --> 04:18:07,670
Let's check if this is correct.

3754
04:18:08,950 --> 04:18:09,930
It's not correct.

3755
04:18:12,310 --> 04:18:14,350
Wait, and then I can't go back.

3756
04:18:16,680 --> 04:18:20,540
Okay, well now we know, because otherwise we wouldn't have
known, right?

3757
04:18:21,200 --> 04:18:21,680
Right.

3758
04:18:22,480 --> 04:18:24,120
Learning is half the battle.

3759
04:18:24,840 --> 04:18:25,960
We wouldn't have known otherwise.

3760
04:18:26,420 --> 04:18:26,860
Oh my gosh.

3761
04:18:27,340 --> 04:18:28,140
Leave me alone.

3762
04:18:28,340 --> 04:18:36,390
Oh, ha-minto!

3763
04:18:37,090 --> 04:18:38,070
Oh, ha-minto!

3764
04:18:39,390 --> 04:18:40,690
Let's explore a little bit.

3765
04:18:41,090 --> 04:18:42,170
Have I been here before?

3766
04:18:46,710 --> 04:18:47,730
Have I been here before?

3767
04:18:47,830 --> 04:18:48,310
Oh my gosh.

3768
04:18:48,430 --> 04:18:49,110
Look at all this.

3769
04:18:49,170 --> 04:18:52,070
Look at all this Atlantis imagery.

3770
04:18:53,910 --> 04:18:55,930
Including very tall bust.

3771
04:18:57,950 --> 04:18:59,230
And grave.

3772
04:19:01,510 --> 04:19:03,770
Yeah, I'm glad all you fuckers died, man.

3773
04:19:05,650 --> 04:19:07,570
Atlantis no butthole more like it.

3774
04:19:14,160 --> 04:19:15,960
Don't be so rude.

3775
04:19:21,880 --> 04:19:23,240
Is that a fountain?

3776
04:19:23,400 --> 04:19:24,600
Oh, it might be, actually.

3777
04:19:26,140 --> 04:19:27,080
Spicy mint.

3778
04:19:29,140 --> 04:19:31,480
Sorry, I am a little spicy right now.

3779
04:19:35,570 --> 04:19:36,530
We're gonna run out of time!

3780
04:19:46,290 --> 04:19:47,190
That's okay, okay.

3781
04:19:50,070 --> 04:19:51,670
When we go over there.

3782
04:19:51,990 --> 04:19:53,070
Do not go through that door.

3783
04:19:53,830 --> 04:19:55,670
Because you won't be able to get out.

3784
04:19:56,730 --> 04:19:58,850
So, we discovered another thing.

3785
04:19:58,990 --> 04:20:00,170
We discovered another thing.

3786
04:20:02,450 --> 04:20:03,550
Rage meter update when.

3787
04:20:03,670 --> 04:20:04,990
I'm actually not raging at all.

3788
04:20:08,250 --> 04:20:10,070
I'm actually pretty okay.

3789
04:20:10,230 --> 04:20:19,850
I thought I would be raging way more But I'm actually
alright I think we Okay never mind

3790
04:20:27,310 --> 04:20:33,130
These damn Crows Vultures, whatever they are

3791
04:20:38,490 --> 04:20:52,790
Poop Poop, poop, poop What annoys me the most is we There's
no in-between to get more points, you know?

3792
04:20:53,870 --> 04:20:56,150
Between now and...

3793
04:20:58,730 --> 04:21:00,650
I'm getting to level 10.

3794
04:21:01,030 --> 04:21:02,410
So it's just...

3795
04:21:02,410 --> 04:21:03,610
Pure skill, baby.

3796
04:21:06,010 --> 04:21:07,610
Pure skill...

3797
04:21:07,610 --> 04:21:09,130
I mean...

3798
04:21:10,090 --> 04:21:11,850
We did level 8.

3799
04:21:12,390 --> 04:21:13,170
One try.

3800
04:21:14,210 --> 04:21:15,710
I don't think we will again.

3801
04:21:17,330 --> 04:21:18,130
And...

3802
04:21:18,150 --> 04:21:18,990
Oh, wrong way.

3803
04:21:23,070 --> 04:21:26,480
And level 10 in like three tries.

3804
04:21:27,730 --> 04:21:28,710
Actually, I don't remember, it might've been four.

3805
04:21:28,930 --> 04:21:29,450
Who cares?

3806
04:21:30,310 --> 04:21:31,310
Atlantis, no unko.

3807
04:21:31,810 --> 04:21:32,910
So true.

3808
04:21:35,770 --> 04:21:36,690
Unchi everywhere.

3809
04:21:38,370 --> 04:21:39,850
Fish incoming!

3810
04:21:45,550 --> 04:21:46,830
Fish incoming!

3811
04:21:50,840 --> 04:21:52,140
Let this guy die.

3812
04:21:52,540 --> 04:21:53,240
Fish incoming!

3813
04:21:57,210 --> 04:21:58,010
Fish incoming!

3814
04:21:59,870 --> 04:22:01,250
They were a little late there, buddy.

3815
04:22:02,210 --> 04:22:03,130
I almost was proven...

3816
04:22:03,130 --> 04:22:04,430
I almost looked like a liar.

3817
04:22:06,150 --> 04:22:07,390
And there's no good!

3818
04:22:09,150 --> 04:22:10,450
Oh, I was like, what is this one?

3819
04:22:10,930 --> 04:22:11,410
Oh my god.

3820
04:22:16,970 --> 04:22:18,230
We game through there?

3821
04:22:18,610 --> 04:22:19,450
We game through that?

3822
04:22:20,330 --> 04:22:21,170
Okay, here we go.

3823
04:22:21,270 --> 04:22:35,030
everybody I don't know why I deployed that but it's fine
just for safe measure how I lived I don't know but I lived

3825

Ah!

3827
04:23:21,250 --> 04:23:22,070
No!

3828
04:23:28,340 --> 04:23:35,180
I didn't, that was just me not getting enough of a head
start.

3829
04:23:37,210 --> 04:23:38,740
How many lives do I have left?

3830
04:23:39,980 --> 04:23:40,800
It's five?

3831
04:23:42,620 --> 04:23:43,980
Actually, not sure.

3832
04:23:55,960 --> 04:23:56,780
Okay.

3833
04:23:57,600 --> 04:23:59,080
Oh yeah, okay.

3834
04:23:59,080 --> 04:23:59,540
Oh yeah!

3835
04:24:00,480 --> 04:24:01,500
Oh yeah!

3836
04:24:08,330 --> 04:24:14,050
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, I didn't know if
I was gonna make that.

3837
04:24:17,010 --> 04:24:21,370
Please, I need you to make jump longer strides, sir.

3838
04:24:22,810 --> 04:24:25,490
I know your legs can handle it.

3839
04:24:51,410 --> 04:24:53,090
Any crab percent.

3840
04:24:56,770 --> 04:24:58,670
Any crab person.

3841
04:25:03,500 --> 04:25:05,500
Remember, happy day!

3842
04:25:06,860 --> 04:25:09,260
I've already wasted a few seconds, man!

3843
04:25:10,100 --> 04:25:13,560
I mean, I say seconds, it's a few numbers.

3844
04:25:13,900 --> 04:25:16,580
I don't even know how fast it's going.

3845
04:25:20,360 --> 04:25:22,380
I knew I was gonna run into that guy.

3846
04:25:22,560 --> 04:25:24,140
I knew it.

3847
04:25:37,920 --> 04:25:38,480
Safe.

3848
04:25:41,860 --> 04:25:43,620
I'm so glad you can throw things in the air.

3849
04:25:44,880 --> 04:25:47,860
I'm so glad you can throw bombs in the air.

3850
04:25:48,200 --> 04:25:51,100
Or else I would have been done so.

3851
04:25:52,640 --> 04:25:53,760
Done so.

3852
04:25:57,160 --> 04:25:58,400
There's two of them.

3853
04:26:05,550 --> 04:26:06,110
Please.

3854
04:26:08,010 --> 04:26:09,010
Tell me 200.

3855
04:26:11,270 --> 04:26:12,010
Oh my god, please.

3856
04:26:12,290 --> 04:26:12,710
Please, sir.

3857
04:26:13,650 --> 04:26:14,190
Please, sir.

3858
04:26:14,630 --> 04:26:15,590
Please, please, please.

3859
04:26:17,670 --> 04:26:19,790
Please, please, please, please, please, please.

3860
04:26:21,130 --> 04:26:21,330
Okay.

3861
04:26:23,090 --> 04:26:25,230
Four lives in the 10th zone.

3862
04:26:28,650 --> 04:26:36,030
It might not be enough, but we shall see.

3863
04:26:47,540 --> 04:26:50,220
I'm so this game is making me so out of breath.

3864
04:26:57,290 --> 04:26:58,350
Good, good, good.

3865
04:26:59,650 --> 04:27:01,110
Don't jinx it though.

3866
04:27:12,060 --> 04:27:13,260
Let's go!

3867
04:27:20,050 --> 04:27:21,670
Any crab percentages?

3868
04:27:23,270 --> 04:27:24,470
Yes, crabby.

3869
04:27:28,720 --> 04:27:31,020
Alright, now I just need to not mess it up here.

3870
04:27:33,520 --> 04:27:34,120
Okay.

3871
04:27:42,950 --> 04:27:44,230
Nice suit!

3872
04:27:49,800 --> 04:27:50,840
Nice suit!

3873
04:27:52,540 --> 04:27:52,800
Okay.

3874
04:27:57,270 --> 04:27:57,910
Okay!

3875
04:27:58,250 --> 04:27:59,170
25th zone!

3876
04:28:00,930 --> 04:28:01,710
Let's go!

3877
04:28:01,930 --> 04:28:02,190
Okay.

3878
04:28:05,410 --> 04:28:07,490
Now we know it's not that door.

3879
04:28:16,500 --> 04:28:17,740
What does this do?

3880
04:28:17,840 --> 04:28:18,640
What does this give me?

3881
04:28:20,680 --> 04:28:22,140
I can't get it.

3882
04:28:23,500 --> 04:28:24,300
Don't go through that, though.

3883
04:28:24,460 --> 04:28:25,260
Don't go through that.

3884
04:28:26,320 --> 04:28:27,960
So much poop, I know, right?

3885
04:28:28,820 --> 04:28:29,900
Um, oh shoot.

3886
04:28:30,280 --> 04:28:33,860
Okay, I'm gonna have to start blowing stuff up, I suppose.

3887
04:28:36,200 --> 04:28:37,300
Hoping for the best.

3888
04:28:38,140 --> 04:28:38,660
But, oh.

3889
04:28:40,060 --> 04:28:40,500
Hmm.

3890
04:28:42,340 --> 04:28:43,100
Looks like a clock.

3891
04:28:43,200 --> 04:28:44,600
Does it slow down the time?

3892
04:28:44,960 --> 04:28:47,220
Because if so, I really need that right now.

3893
04:28:48,040 --> 04:28:48,500
I really

3894
04:28:53,420 --> 04:28:54,320
need...

3895
04:28:54,320 --> 04:28:57,080
I wonder if I should just...

3896
04:29:05,150 --> 04:29:05,590
Okay.

3897
04:29:10,170 --> 04:29:13,490
here maybe because this is where

3898
04:29:17,750 --> 04:29:30,770
no do I go up no hmm I think if I collect that clock I go
straight into that door ah

3899
04:29:35,150 --> 04:29:39,570
okay um if any hint givers want to give a hint right now.

3900
04:29:43,140 --> 04:29:45,800
The clock slows down the timer to actual seconds.

3901
04:29:46,040 --> 04:29:47,080
Oh, that's so nice!

3902
04:29:47,320 --> 04:29:48,300
I want it!

3903
04:29:48,300 --> 04:29:51,800
I want it!

3904
04:29:53,200 --> 04:29:53,300
Ah!

3905
04:29:54,600 --> 04:29:54,960
Please!

3906
04:29:57,240 --> 04:29:59,800
Unless it's like I have to blow up myself somewhere.

3907
04:30:00,520 --> 04:30:02,340
I'm afraid to blow up myself right here.

3908
04:30:02,980 --> 04:30:04,080
Blow up the right chest.

3909
04:30:05,040 --> 04:30:05,420
No.

3910
04:30:07,780 --> 04:30:08,260
Nothing.

3911
04:30:13,580 --> 04:30:22,700
I think I just already did that spot but i don't think i did
here next to the chest okay let's go let's go back through

3912
04:30:22,700 --> 04:30:38,510

3913
04:30:43,000 --> 04:30:50,640

3914
04:30:52,620 --> 04:30:52,820

3915
04:30:55,820 --> 04:30:56,420
Oh wait.

3916
04:30:57,560 --> 04:31:01,160
Uh, is this another blow it up?

3917
04:31:02,380 --> 04:31:02,940
Uh-huh.

3918
04:31:02,940 --> 04:31:03,880
Uh-huh.

3919
04:31:11,650 --> 04:31:14,690
Um, if I put it down, it's gonna open up that door.

3920
04:31:15,910 --> 04:31:16,250
Hmm.

3921
04:31:19,090 --> 04:31:19,610
Um.

3922
04:31:26,290 --> 04:31:26,850
Uh.

3923
04:31:28,010 --> 04:31:28,830
Try it.

04:31:28,850 --> 04:31:40,650
to create green rave when maybe if i bounce oh dang it i was
gonna say if i bounce it how the hell maybe i there we go

94 oh no it's brown rave oh god it's brown rave everybody

3927
04:32:04,150 --> 04:32:09,050
Okay, I thought this was the ice area and I was nervous for
a second because I thought that it would be slippery, but

3928
04:32:09,050 --> 04:32:10,570
it's not at all, actually.

3929
04:32:12,990 --> 04:32:15,750
Oh my goodness, it's brown rave!

3930
04:32:17,070 --> 04:32:18,430
Wait, where do I go from here?

3931
04:32:19,050 --> 04:32:20,010
Uh oh, wait a second.

3932
04:32:23,110 --> 04:32:25,430
Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, did I go the
wrong way?

3933
04:32:26,650 --> 04:32:27,530
Oh, shoot.

3934
04:32:28,770 --> 04:32:29,350
Hold on.

3935
04:32:32,190 --> 04:32:33,490
No, there's nothing that way either.

3936
04:32:35,450 --> 04:32:36,230
Wait, huh?

3937
04:32:37,410 --> 04:32:38,490
Okay, hold on.

3938
04:32:41,590 --> 04:32:43,290
Maybe next to this chest.

3939
04:32:46,910 --> 04:32:47,710
Oh, uh...

3940
04:32:51,460 --> 04:32:52,640
Okay, I guess not.

3941
04:32:55,780 --> 04:32:56,180
Uh...

3942
04:32:56,720 --> 04:32:57,800
Oh my god, please.

3943
04:32:57,940 --> 04:33:00,740
Actually, someone just tell me the answer so that I can get
out of here.

3944
04:33:00,900 --> 04:33:02,240
This is because this is so awful!

3945
04:33:03,180 --> 04:33:03,740
Oh, wait!

3946
04:33:04,060 --> 04:33:04,760
I think... Wait.

3947
04:33:05,080 --> 04:33:06,780
I think I remember this one from the game.

3948
04:33:06,800 --> 04:33:18,000
center episode oh no you guys we might be here for a while
oh no no no i lost time oh shoot i didn't notice the time

3950
04:33:36,780 --> 04:33:41,200

3951
04:33:41,340 --> 04:33:41,420
Oh.

3952
04:34:03,430 --> 04:34:03,830
God.

3953
04:34:04,410 --> 04:34:07,410
And then we have to watch this terrible flashing.

3954
04:34:10,030 --> 04:34:10,830
Oh gosh.

3955
04:34:11,810 --> 04:34:14,130
Oh, why is it, why is there like a motion blur there?

3956
04:34:14,150 --> 04:34:14,890
Are you guys seeing that?

3957
04:34:18,370 --> 04:34:19,790
What the, what is going on?

3958
04:34:19,790 --> 04:34:33,950

know it's on that ledge I have to like jump down place the

3959
04:34:33,950 --> 04:34:43,270
bomb jump kind of like how I was doing it before I know how
to do it I know how to do it actually I'm curious though one

3960
04:34:43,270 --> 04:34:52,630
second after 94, 97 and then 100 you guys It's just two more
after 94.

3961
04:34:53,150 --> 04:34:54,090
It's just two more.

3962
04:34:54,250 --> 04:34:57,430
And 100 will be super easy because we'll have the
invincibility.

3963
04:34:57,970 --> 04:35:00,070
Like, we've got this.

3964
04:35:00,570 --> 04:35:01,430
We got this.

3965
04:35:03,770 --> 04:35:05,030
We're so close.

3966
04:35:05,170 --> 04:35:06,370
We're so close, actually.

3967
04:35:12,230 --> 04:35:12,870
Okay.

3968
04:35:16,510 --> 04:35:25,130
If I can make it there without losing any lives in a stupid
way, then we might be able to do it.

3969
04:35:30,450 --> 04:35:32,490
100 is the victory lap if it can get there.

3970
04:35:32,610 --> 04:35:32,890
Exactly!

3971
04:35:33,210 --> 04:35:34,490
Because we'll have the invincibility.

3972
04:35:41,210 --> 04:35:42,650
But we've made such good progress.

3973
04:35:43,230 --> 04:35:43,890
Proud of us.

3974
04:35:44,690 --> 04:35:45,470
Proud of us.

3975
04:35:48,250 --> 04:35:50,990
Why is the timer gotta be so cruel, though?

3976
04:35:52,110 --> 04:35:54,610
The flow of time is so cruel.

3977
04:35:54,870 --> 04:35:55,910
It's a cruel mistress.

3978
04:36:04,940 --> 04:36:06,780
Trust in your instincts as a soldier.

3979
04:36:07,460 --> 04:36:08,280
As a gamer.

3980
04:36:08,440 --> 04:36:10,280
Yes, Master!

3981
04:36:13,600 --> 04:36:14,900
Master Palette!

3982
04:36:16,380 --> 04:36:17,720
Fish incoming!

3983
04:36:19,280 --> 04:36:20,720
Why are you a backwards fish?

3984
04:36:22,920 --> 04:36:24,360
Fish incoming!

3985
04:36:26,800 --> 04:36:28,260
Oh my gosh, that was so close.

3986
04:36:29,160 --> 04:36:29,880
Sheesh.

3987
04:36:32,620 --> 04:36:34,520
Let these guys fall off the edge.

3988
04:36:36,780 --> 04:36:37,700
Fish incoming!

3989
04:36:43,680 --> 04:36:45,800
Fish, fish and cover!

3990
04:36:46,960 --> 04:36:49,480
Okay, sixth zone.

3991
04:36:54,380 --> 04:36:55,480
Oh, I missed it.

3992
04:36:55,820 --> 04:36:57,660
Oh my god, oh my god.

3993
04:36:58,300 --> 04:36:59,380
Okay, nice, nice, nice, nice.

3994
04:37:00,740 --> 04:37:02,440
Oh, that was so close.

3995
04:37:03,000 --> 04:37:04,120
That was so close.

3996
04:37:04,260 --> 04:37:05,580
All right, here we go.

3997
04:37:07,680 --> 04:37:09,420
Gaming, I'm gaming.

3998
04:37:19,590 --> 04:37:20,030
Oh,

3999
04:37:58,860 --> 04:38:00,040
I'm not gonna make it.

4000
04:38:00,820 --> 04:38:01,720
Oh, I'm not gonna make it.

4001
04:38:02,160 --> 04:38:03,060
I'm not gonna make it.

4002
04:38:03,980 --> 04:38:05,680
I'm not gonna make it, you guys.

4003
04:38:06,520 --> 04:38:07,940
I'm not gonna make it, you guys.

4004
04:38:08,220 --> 04:38:09,100
I'm not gonna make it.

4005
04:38:10,220 --> 04:38:11,440
I'm not gonna make it.

4006
04:38:12,460 --> 04:38:13,520
I'm not gonna make it.

4007
04:38:15,220 --> 04:38:16,760
I don't have I'm not gonna make it.

4008
04:38:17,520 --> 04:38:18,640
I'm not gonna make it.

4009
04:38:28,830 --> 04:38:29,270
Oh!

4010
04:38:30,690 --> 04:38:32,370
I made it!

4011
04:38:55,500 --> 04:38:56,200
Yippee!

4012
04:38:57,160 --> 04:39:00,340
I made

4013
04:39:15,150 --> 04:39:16,490
it!

4014
04:39:17,650 --> 04:39:18,870
Yippee!

4015
04:39:23,070 --> 04:39:23,770
Yippee!

4016
04:39:30,470 --> 04:39:32,170
Oh my god!

4017
04:39:32,910 --> 04:39:34,030
Oh god!

4018
04:39:34,910 --> 04:39:35,190
Oh!

4019
04:39:38,250 --> 04:39:38,570
Oh!

4020
04:39:40,210 --> 04:39:41,470
Okay, okay.

4021
04:39:42,130 --> 04:39:42,970
Fourth zone.

4022
04:39:44,870 --> 04:39:45,670
Just don't...

4023
04:39:45,670 --> 04:39:47,030
Don't mess it up, Minto.

4024
04:39:54,560 --> 04:39:56,960
I don't know why I waited for that guy to pass.

4025
04:39:57,820 --> 04:40:00,200
I was just being courteous to him, I guess, you know.

4026
04:40:03,520 --> 04:40:04,080
Okay.

4027
04:40:04,880 --> 04:40:05,440
Okay.

4028
04:40:06,040 --> 04:40:10,660
I'm gonna try and get through the poop rave as quickly as I
I possibly can, you guys.

4029
04:40:15,000 --> 04:40:16,100
I wish I could grab this.

4030
04:40:16,320 --> 04:40:17,440
I really wish I could.

4031
04:40:19,000 --> 04:40:20,400
Oh my god.

4032
04:40:20,660 --> 04:40:21,500
Oh my god.

4033
04:40:24,820 --> 04:40:25,880
Okay, poop rave.

4034
04:40:26,820 --> 04:40:27,140
Ikiimasu.

4035
04:40:28,360 --> 04:40:29,620
Shield your eyes, please.

4036
04:40:30,400 --> 04:40:31,060
Shield your eyes.

4037
04:40:31,300 --> 04:40:31,740
Oh, sorry.

4038
04:40:31,940 --> 04:40:34,540
Actually, I thought the poop rave was right now.

4039
04:40:36,100 --> 04:40:36,900
Not bad.

4040
04:40:39,000 --> 04:40:39,320
Okay.

4041
04:40:39,720 --> 04:40:40,260
Poop rave.

4042
04:40:48,060 --> 04:40:51,680
Everything jumping at once is really a lot.

4043
04:40:53,180 --> 04:40:56,040
It's a little overwhelming.

4044
04:40:57,360 --> 04:40:57,780
All right.

4045
04:41:32,560 --> 04:41:34,500
We were doing so well.

4046
04:41:53,080 --> 04:41:53,860
It's okay.

4047
04:41:54,560 --> 04:41:55,940
You saw how quickly we got here.

4048
04:41:57,000 --> 04:41:58,260
We got back here so quickly.

4049
04:41:58,360 --> 04:42:00,040
I just want to get out of this damn room.

4050
04:42:03,420 --> 04:42:05,440
It's so awful at my eyes.

4051
04:42:12,020 --> 04:42:12,360
Okay.

4052
04:42:13,180 --> 04:42:14,440
We got there quickly though.

4053
04:42:21,050 --> 04:42:22,570
Update the rage meter.

4054
04:42:24,550 --> 04:42:25,070
Poop.

4055
04:42:27,430 --> 04:42:27,950
Grave.

4056
04:42:28,930 --> 04:42:29,190
Percent.

4057
04:42:35,150 --> 04:42:36,250
The green was so much worse though.

4058
04:42:36,370 --> 04:42:37,010
It actually was.

4059
04:42:37,170 --> 04:42:37,610
You are right.

4060
04:42:39,930 --> 04:42:41,630
I was actually concerned.

4061
04:42:41,810 --> 04:42:42,790
I was like, oh my gosh.

4062
04:42:43,310 --> 04:42:44,890
I really hope that...

4063
04:42:44,890 --> 04:42:46,430
Because I had no idea it was a thing.

4064
04:42:46,610 --> 04:42:50,130
I really hope that, like, I didn't cause anyone harm.

4065
04:42:50,350 --> 04:42:52,450
Like, if they were epileptic or something.

4066
04:42:52,650 --> 04:42:53,150
Oh my god.

4067
04:42:53,470 --> 04:42:56,310
I was actually legitimately worried.

4068
04:43:01,570 --> 04:43:03,150
Back from watching Shin Godzilla.

4069
04:43:03,410 --> 04:43:04,330
Nam was right as good.

4070
04:43:05,150 --> 04:43:06,050
Have you still not watched?

4071
04:43:06,070 --> 04:43:07,090
Shut up, J.B.

4072
04:43:07,390 --> 04:43:08,470
Shut the hell up!

4073
04:43:08,790 --> 04:43:09,510
Shut up!

4074
04:43:11,490 --> 04:43:14,010
and we're still not one

4075
04:43:36,870 --> 04:43:44,750
are you winning minto we're really close I'll be honest
we're actually so close you guys we're actually so close we

4076
04:43:44,750 --> 04:43:56,590
were actually so close I just timed the bomb wrong I've
timed the bomb wrong I timed uh

4077
04:44:02,370 --> 04:44:04,230
I actually was really concerned.

4078
04:44:04,350 --> 04:44:09,410
I was like, maybe I shouldn't play this game today because
exactly the reaction I wanted does go to.

4079
04:44:10,770 --> 04:44:19,330
I was like, I wonder if I'm going to get legitimately mad
because I'm a little sensitive this week.

4080
04:44:19,870 --> 04:44:21,110
So I was just like, uh-oh.

4081
04:44:21,490 --> 04:44:24,150
What if I like actually, actually start to rage?

4082
04:44:24,750 --> 04:44:26,930
Like, it's not fun for people watching.

4083
04:44:35,060 --> 04:44:36,380
It's time to jump wrong.

4084
04:44:36,560 --> 04:44:38,060
That's what I said.

4085
04:44:45,220 --> 04:44:46,520
It's Ghost Week.

4086
04:44:50,270 --> 04:44:51,770
The time of the...

4087
04:44:51,770 --> 04:44:56,550
It's time of every month where a ghost is more rageful.

4088
04:45:15,310 --> 04:45:15,690
Okay.

4089
04:45:17,530 --> 04:45:18,130
Alright.

4090
04:45:18,530 --> 04:45:19,650
Altergeist week.

4091
04:45:20,790 --> 04:45:21,490
Fish is coming!

4092
04:45:26,150 --> 04:45:27,790
Oh my gosh.

4093
04:45:28,010 --> 04:45:30,690
The things that I have to do to keep myself sane.

4094
04:45:32,810 --> 04:45:34,150
Fish is coming!

4095
04:45:37,290 --> 04:45:37,890
Okay.

4096
04:45:39,310 --> 04:45:40,410
Sixth zone.

4097
04:45:45,450 --> 04:45:45,630
Oh.

4098
04:45:46,030 --> 04:45:46,750
Oh my god.

4099
04:45:47,310 --> 04:45:47,890
Oh my god.

4100
04:45:48,150 --> 04:45:48,550
What the?

4101
04:45:57,310 --> 04:45:57,910
Um.

4102
04:46:02,120 --> 04:46:04,920
Um, what was that, a secret door that I unlocked?

4103
04:46:05,120 --> 04:46:05,980
Did you guys see that?

4104
04:46:06,440 --> 04:46:07,860
There was another door!

4105
04:46:09,300 --> 04:46:10,500
I wonder where that went to.

4106
04:46:11,660 --> 04:46:13,280
Oh my gosh, I thought...

4107
04:46:13,280 --> 04:46:14,560
I thought I was gonna run into them.

4108
04:46:14,860 --> 04:46:15,840
That's why I stopped moving.

4109
04:46:15,920 --> 04:46:18,280
Because I was like, okay, I guess I'll die here.

4110
04:46:20,220 --> 04:46:22,480
I guess it's time for to die!

4111
04:46:23,040 --> 04:46:24,720
Oh, oh, oh.

4112
04:46:26,500 --> 04:46:28,140
That was clutch.

4113
04:46:36,190 --> 04:46:41,410
I'm like gripping my controller so hard right now!

4114
04:46:41,650 --> 04:46:43,190
It's kind of insane.

4115
04:46:48,530 --> 04:46:48,910
Hoi!

4116
04:46:49,950 --> 04:46:50,110
Hoi!

4117
04:46:51,630 --> 04:46:51,890
Hoi!

4118
04:46:55,050 --> 04:46:55,290
Hoi!

4119
04:46:55,390 --> 04:46:56,030
Hoi!

4120
04:46:56,430 --> 04:46:56,850
Hoi!

4121
04:46:56,850 --> 04:46:57,250
Hoi!

4122
04:46:57,730 --> 04:46:58,390
Hoi!

4123
04:47:01,060 --> 04:47:01,380
Nice.

4124
04:47:02,100 --> 04:47:04,260
Nice, uh...

4125
04:47:05,140 --> 04:47:06,960
Oh, oh my gosh.

4126
04:47:09,120 --> 04:47:14,900
I wonder if I should start grabbing that chest if I have
extra time if it will be enough for me to, like, get, uh, oh

4127
04:47:14,900 --> 04:47:17,500
my god, an extra life.

4128
04:47:44,630 --> 04:47:47,270
I was gonna say something, but I'm not gonna jinx this
level.

4129
04:47:47,930 --> 04:47:48,930
I'm not gonna jinx it.

4130
04:47:49,430 --> 04:47:50,490
I'm not gonna jinx it.

4131
04:47:54,590 --> 04:47:55,870
I'm just not gonna say anything.

4132
04:47:56,850 --> 04:47:58,010
I'm just not gonna say anything.

4133
04:48:05,210 --> 04:48:09,210
I'm so glad I've gotten better at this level, but...

4134
04:48:11,550 --> 04:48:12,750
Oh, man.

4135
04:48:15,690 --> 04:48:16,890
Oh, man.

4136
04:48:35,210 --> 04:48:37,770
I'm throwing, I'm throwing, I'm throwing.

4137
04:49:00,090 --> 04:49:00,450
No.

4138
04:49:01,470 --> 04:49:03,450
I don't even know how many lives I have left.

4139
04:49:15,760 --> 04:49:17,200
I don't even know how many lives I have left.

4140
04:49:19,080 --> 04:49:19,740
I don't even know.

4141
04:49:23,680 --> 04:49:24,560
I don't even know.

4142
04:49:26,660 --> 04:49:27,500
Not that many.

4143
04:49:27,740 --> 04:49:28,820
Not as many as I had.

4144
04:49:29,280 --> 04:49:30,840
At the beginning of the stage.

4145
04:49:31,380 --> 04:49:32,260
Why did I do that?

4146
04:49:34,380 --> 04:49:34,740
One!

4147
04:49:53,130 --> 04:49:54,410
I'm not mad.

4148
04:49:54,610 --> 04:49:56,110
I'm mostly just sad.

4149
04:49:57,650 --> 04:49:58,750
I'm mostly just sad.

4150
04:50:04,330 --> 04:50:05,010
Daijobu.

4151
04:50:10,250 --> 04:50:10,930
Daijobu.

4152
04:50:19,930 --> 04:50:20,290
Two.

4153
04:50:22,630 --> 04:50:28,830
Forgive me while I'm worried about your voice, the shrill
screams you were making, are too adorable.

4154
04:50:32,330 --> 04:50:34,970
Why is me screaming adorable?

4155
04:50:36,810 --> 04:50:39,790
That was too close for comfort.

4156
04:50:39,950 --> 04:50:41,390
I'm gonna try and get the treasure down here.

4157
04:50:43,050 --> 04:50:44,930
I think I have enough time to get it.

4158
04:51:02,500 --> 04:51:03,960
I think I have enough time to get it.

4159
04:51:04,920 --> 04:51:05,640
There we go.

4160
04:51:06,560 --> 04:51:06,780
Okay.

4161
04:51:08,400 --> 04:51:10,360
I love the sound of people suffering.

4162
04:51:10,660 --> 04:51:11,900
Fish incoming!

4163
04:51:15,240 --> 04:51:17,280
Fish incoming!

4164
04:51:17,920 --> 04:51:18,920
Oh, I was early.

4165
04:51:24,610 --> 04:51:25,890
Fish!

4166
04:51:26,710 --> 04:51:28,230
Fish incoming!

4167
04:51:35,240 --> 04:51:35,880
Please.

4168
04:51:39,860 --> 04:51:41,440
Okay, there we go.

4169
04:51:42,620 --> 04:51:44,280
Eighth zone.

4170
04:51:44,920 --> 04:51:45,560
Let's go!

4171
04:51:51,720 --> 04:51:53,520
Wow, there's no guys over here today.

4172
04:51:54,860 --> 04:51:56,480
They're all crammed up there instead.

4173
04:52:00,790 --> 04:52:01,610
And in there.

4174
04:52:05,620 --> 04:52:05,900
Hiya!

4175
04:52:07,180 --> 04:52:07,820
Hiya!

4176
04:52:16,530 --> 04:52:19,750
Sorry I get so quiet at this level, I'm really
concentrating.

4177
04:52:51,950 --> 04:52:53,510
It's only 13!

4178
04:52:55,690 --> 04:52:56,650
Messed up.

4179
04:53:01,090 --> 04:53:03,030
Oh, I thought I died real quick.

4180
04:53:03,590 --> 04:53:04,290
Oh, my gosh.

4181
04:53:09,150 --> 04:53:09,650
Okay.

4182
04:53:44,700 --> 04:53:46,940
I don't know why I'm getting the timing on this.

4183
04:53:47,580 --> 04:53:49,500
Or I'm not getting the timing on this, rather.

4184
04:53:50,060 --> 04:53:51,020
Like, I'm getting it.

4185
04:53:51,100 --> 04:53:52,740
I'm doing so poorly with the timing.

4186
04:53:55,360 --> 04:53:58,340
This game is really playing mine games on me.

4187
04:53:59,920 --> 04:54:00,920
It's really...

4188
04:54:00,920 --> 04:54:02,880
It's really playing mine!

4189
04:54:03,260 --> 04:54:05,860
on me!

4190
04:54:07,780 --> 04:54:08,120
Oh!

4191
04:54:09,700 --> 04:54:10,860
Oh!

4192
04:54:12,680 --> 04:54:13,300
Oh!

4193
04:54:14,040 --> 04:54:14,360
Oh!

4194
04:54:15,040 --> 04:54:15,180
Oh!

4195
04:54:17,020 --> 04:54:17,640
Why?

4196
04:54:20,320 --> 04:54:21,080
My

4197
04:54:38,290 --> 04:54:38,910
goodness.

4198
04:55:05,300 --> 04:55:06,540
Okay.

4199
04:55:07,240 --> 04:55:07,960
What are we at?

4200
04:55:07,960 --> 04:55:08,680
Five lives?

4201
04:55:10,380 --> 04:55:10,560
Four?

4202
04:55:13,400 --> 04:55:14,840
Oh, shucks.

4203
04:55:18,220 --> 04:55:19,600
Nice number.

4204
04:55:20,420 --> 04:55:21,300
Spooky number.

4205
04:55:22,360 --> 04:55:22,720
Four.

4206
04:55:29,100 --> 04:55:30,440
And the fourth zone.

4207
04:55:31,500 --> 04:55:32,600
Okay, all right.

4208
04:55:50,210 --> 04:55:52,810
I hope you guys are just as invested as I am.

4209
04:55:58,770 --> 04:56:02,770
Alright, this one has the clock that I can possibly get.

4210
04:56:06,280 --> 04:56:06,800
Ugh.

4211
04:56:08,540 --> 04:56:09,280
What was it?

4212
04:56:09,360 --> 04:56:11,060
I think I went from this side.

4213
04:56:12,960 --> 04:56:13,360
No.

4214
04:56:16,770 --> 04:56:17,290
Nice!

4215
04:56:17,650 --> 04:56:18,290
Okay, alright.

4216
04:56:19,370 --> 04:56:19,690
Alright.

4217
04:56:20,290 --> 04:56:24,730
Even though I know I'm invincible, the poop still psychs me
out a little bit.

4218
04:56:26,330 --> 04:56:28,130
Okay, what is that hitbox?

4219
04:56:28,650 --> 04:56:31,410
Oh, right now we're invincible, so...

4220
04:56:36,880 --> 04:56:40,220
Alright, poop rave time!

4221
04:57:00,130 --> 04:57:01,530
Okay.

4222
04:57:04,690 --> 04:57:06,090
Okay.

4223
04:57:11,360 --> 04:57:12,300
Nine lives!

4224
04:57:18,550 --> 04:57:18,910
Oh!

4225
04:57:22,370 --> 04:57:23,690
Oh my god!

4226
04:57:30,520 --> 04:57:36,140
Um, you guys, I don't...

4227
04:57:39,330 --> 04:57:40,790
If I jump, nothing happens.

4228
04:57:40,950 --> 04:57:42,130
If I jump, nothing happens.

4229
04:57:44,030 --> 04:57:45,430
Okay, time for leap of faith!

4230
04:57:47,230 --> 04:57:48,870
Oh my god!

4231
04:58:10,620 --> 04:58:12,940
Look at me taking all these hits.

4232
04:58:14,520 --> 04:58:15,160
No way.

4233
04:58:16,280 --> 04:58:16,840
No way.

4234
04:58:17,800 --> 04:58:18,460
No way!

4235
04:58:18,660 --> 04:58:19,040
No way!

4236
04:58:19,260 --> 04:58:19,500
No way!

4237
04:58:19,560 --> 04:58:19,960
No way!

4238
04:58:24,460 --> 04:58:25,600
What's over here?

4239
04:58:25,920 --> 04:58:26,900
Oh, okay, nothing.

4240
04:58:30,100 --> 04:58:30,660
Um...

4241
04:58:30,660 --> 04:58:31,540
Congratulations!

4242
04:58:33,160 --> 04:58:33,720
Oh,

4243
04:58:42,230 --> 04:58:42,890
is that it?

4244
04:58:53,290 --> 04:58:56,070
Oh my god, I can't believe we did that last level!

4245
04:58:56,590 --> 04:58:58,570
First try, no way!

4246
04:58:59,750 --> 04:59:00,310
Congratulations!

4247
04:59:05,210 --> 04:59:07,650
Why is the timer still going?

4248
04:59:08,030 --> 04:59:08,650
Can I leave?

4249
04:59:10,350 --> 04:59:10,970
I can!

4250
04:59:11,390 --> 04:59:13,330
Wait, maybe there's another side.

4251
04:59:13,550 --> 04:59:14,330
Maybe there's the other side.

4252
04:59:15,990 --> 04:59:17,210
Why is the timer still going?

4253
04:59:22,330 --> 04:59:22,850
Congratulations!

4254
04:59:25,890 --> 04:59:27,450
No, there's no door over here.

4255
04:59:28,850 --> 04:59:30,470
Yeah, you can play the whole game again!

4256
04:59:30,630 --> 04:59:31,410
But backwards!

4257
04:59:37,810 --> 04:59:39,110
Is that it?

4258
04:59:39,550 --> 04:59:40,690
You have to go backwards.

4259
04:59:48,110 --> 04:59:50,490
Wait, am I just in another?

4260
04:59:50,970 --> 04:59:53,330
I'm literally just in another.

4261
04:59:54,590 --> 04:59:55,850
No way.

4262
04:59:58,390 --> 05:00:00,070
Wait, there's actually...

4263
05:00:00,070 --> 05:00:01,790
There's not even an ending screen.

4264
05:00:03,590 --> 05:00:04,230
Congratulations!

4265
05:00:10,610 --> 05:00:11,910
Thank you for the Hakusupa.

4266
05:00:11,990 --> 05:00:12,470
Got them.

4267
05:00:13,030 --> 05:00:13,910
Thank you.

4268
05:00:14,650 --> 05:00:15,650
Oh, I got 51 cores.

4269
05:00:15,770 --> 05:00:16,630
Thank you for the Hakusupa.

4270
05:00:20,510 --> 05:00:21,150
Cheese.

4271
05:00:21,590 --> 05:00:22,130
Hold on.

4272
05:00:35,550 --> 05:00:36,110
Um...

4273
05:00:36,110 --> 05:00:37,730
I want to be a little taller than them.

4274
05:00:39,070 --> 05:00:39,570
Yippee!

4275
05:00:41,930 --> 05:00:44,890
We beat Atlantis No Naiso!

4276
05:00:45,270 --> 05:00:48,110
Wait, if the timer runs out, do I get a game over, I wonder?

4277
05:00:48,830 --> 05:00:53,810
We beat Atlantis No Naiso in way less time than I expected
it to.

4278
05:00:54,410 --> 05:00:55,170
Holy cow!

4279
05:01:01,000 --> 05:01:03,980
Way less time than I expected to.

4280
05:01:06,180 --> 05:01:08,440
This didn't feel like an endurance at all.

4281
05:01:09,180 --> 05:01:11,320
I got gamered my way through it.

4282
05:01:14,780 --> 05:01:17,620
Hold on, I can, uh, one second.

4283
05:01:18,380 --> 05:01:18,980
Yippee!

4284
05:01:19,480 --> 05:01:20,340
Congratulations!

4285
05:01:21,600 --> 05:01:22,500
Congratulations!

4286
05:01:23,380 --> 05:01:23,880
Congratulations!

4287
05:01:25,800 --> 05:01:27,880
Two, thank you!

4288
05:01:28,740 --> 05:01:29,240
Congratulations!

4289
05:01:34,300 --> 05:01:36,200
It was the grip.

4290
05:01:37,080 --> 05:01:38,560
Oh my gosh.

4291
05:01:41,660 --> 05:01:42,180
Wow.

4292
05:01:42,780 --> 05:01:44,140
This music is driving me crazy.

4293
05:01:44,300 --> 05:01:46,320
But I'm curious what happens when the timer goes out.

4294
05:01:48,660 --> 05:01:49,480
Congratulations, everybody.

4295
05:01:51,760 --> 05:01:53,300
This, oh, this is it.

4296
05:01:53,580 --> 05:01:54,100
This is it.

4297
05:01:54,200 --> 05:01:55,000
Here it comes.

4298
05:01:56,040 --> 05:01:56,900
Five more, there's no one.

4299
05:01:57,020 --> 05:01:57,540
Wow.

4300
05:01:59,040 --> 05:02:00,260
Oh, oh, what are you?

4301
05:02:01,000 --> 05:02:03,400
Oh, oh, boop!

4302
05:02:09,590 --> 05:02:10,490
No way.

4303
05:02:10,870 --> 05:02:13,250
It takes me back to the screen.

4304
05:02:15,410 --> 05:02:18,250
It just tells me congratulations, cat.

4305
05:02:19,630 --> 05:02:20,850
No way.

4306
05:02:21,550 --> 05:02:22,910
No way!

4307
05:02:23,090 --> 05:02:24,470
Sorry, I'm trying to adjust myself.

4308
05:02:25,150 --> 05:02:26,670
Oh my god.

4309
05:02:28,190 --> 05:02:29,630
That is ridiculous.

4310
05:02:30,010 --> 05:02:31,350
Okay, get me out of here, please.

4311
05:02:32,050 --> 05:02:33,410
Did it waste a life?

4312
05:02:33,630 --> 05:02:35,130
I don't actually know.

4313
05:02:35,150 --> 05:02:37,010
Did I waste a life doing that?

4314
05:02:41,690 --> 05:02:43,470
How do I get out of here?

4315
05:02:44,990 --> 05:02:45,930
Yeah, I did.

4316
05:02:50,030 --> 05:02:51,830
Yeah, who is this guy?

4317
05:02:51,970 --> 05:02:52,790
Why are you here?

4318
05:02:53,310 --> 05:02:55,290
Why does it look like you're sitting on the toilet?

4319
05:02:56,530 --> 05:02:58,330
What is this guy?

4320
05:02:58,890 --> 05:03:00,750
The mystery of Atlantis?

4321
05:03:01,490 --> 05:03:02,950
Was it the diamond I got?

4322
05:03:05,150 --> 05:03:06,110
Can you exit the room?

4323
05:03:06,290 --> 05:03:06,650
We can.

4324
05:03:06,950 --> 05:03:07,270
We can.

4325
05:03:08,590 --> 05:03:10,390
Oh my goodness, he's the nozzle.

4326
05:03:12,010 --> 05:03:13,210
Nuzzle, nozzle.

4327
05:03:18,410 --> 05:03:20,610
Thank you for the gift, dead.

4328
05:03:21,390 --> 05:03:21,810
Thank you.

4329
05:03:23,690 --> 05:03:24,050
Okay.

4330
05:03:25,430 --> 05:03:29,570
Do I still have... Oh, I don't have invincibility anymore
because I...

4331
05:03:30,550 --> 05:03:33,070
Because I died on the winning screen.

4332
05:03:34,010 --> 05:03:34,550
Okay.

4333
05:03:35,150 --> 05:03:37,610
Let's just waste all of our lives.

4334
05:03:37,990 --> 05:03:38,950
Wait, there's a door here.

4335
05:03:42,770 --> 05:03:43,890
What's in that door?

4336
05:03:48,150 --> 05:03:50,810
Now nobody can say you aren't a gamer.

4337
05:03:52,570 --> 05:03:53,430
Thank you.

4338
05:03:55,050 --> 05:03:57,250
Uh-oh, he's gonna start shooting at me.

4339
05:03:58,490 --> 05:03:58,890
Yep.

4340
05:04:02,310 --> 05:04:03,310
Oh my god.

4341
05:04:03,670 --> 05:04:04,890
This is...

4342
05:04:06,010 --> 05:04:07,030
Oh my god.

4343
05:04:07,610 --> 05:04:08,470
Oh my god.

4344
05:04:09,210 --> 05:04:10,870
Why is this game so hard?

4345
05:04:11,430 --> 05:04:13,450
It's so obtuse, rather.

4346
05:04:17,050 --> 05:04:19,270
I'm trying to die, but I'm too good at this game.

4347
05:04:19,470 --> 05:04:21,450
Wait, I want to see where this door went to.

4348
05:04:24,170 --> 05:04:25,010
Oh my god.

4349
05:04:27,570 --> 05:04:30,250
30 seconds zone, and it's pink.

4350
05:04:32,190 --> 05:04:33,150
What's the S?

4351
05:04:33,650 --> 05:04:34,550
Oh, oops, my bad.

4352
05:04:35,490 --> 05:04:36,450
We're in like a graveyard.

4353
05:04:39,570 --> 05:04:40,870
I don't know what's.

4354
05:04:40,890 --> 05:04:42,890
That just did...

4355
05:04:46,290 --> 05:04:46,790
Skelies!

4356
05:04:47,790 --> 05:04:49,070
Oh my gosh, look at them jump.

4357
05:04:51,770 --> 05:04:53,050
They're so silly.

4358
05:04:54,030 --> 05:04:55,570
Why am I still playing this game?

4359
05:04:55,990 --> 05:04:56,940
What's wrong with me?

4360
05:04:57,730 --> 05:04:58,210
Wow!

4361
05:04:59,650 --> 05:05:01,830
Why am I still playing this game?

4362
05:05:02,070 --> 05:05:02,920
S equals spooky.

4363
05:05:06,370 --> 05:05:07,120
Wait, if I...

4364
05:05:07,430 --> 05:05:08,290
Can I go this way?

4365
05:05:08,510 --> 05:05:09,190
No, I can't.

4366
05:05:10,890 --> 05:05:13,350
Congratulations, you have completed a great game.

4367
05:05:13,830 --> 05:05:15,550
Improve the justice of our culture.

4368
05:05:16,050 --> 05:05:17,930
What are you talking about?

4369
05:05:19,950 --> 05:05:21,390
Oh, I didn't even notice him.

4370
05:05:30,490 --> 05:05:32,630
Mint better than Arino Kacho confirmed.

4371
05:05:32,870 --> 05:05:34,650
No, no, no, no, no.

4372
05:05:35,230 --> 05:05:37,550
No, no, no, no, no, no.

4373
05:05:37,870 --> 05:05:39,690
No, no, no, no, no.

4374
05:05:40,030 --> 05:05:40,950
How do I please?

4375
05:05:41,050 --> 05:05:42,890
I just want to go to the home screen, honestly.

4376
05:05:44,710 --> 05:05:46,070
I really just want to go to the home screen.

4377
05:05:46,090 --> 05:05:47,250
screen please.

4378
05:05:52,810 --> 05:05:53,810
So I feel okay.

4379
05:05:54,110 --> 05:05:55,730
I cannot believe I beat this game.

4380
05:05:56,850 --> 05:05:57,510
Oh my gosh.

4381
05:05:57,830 --> 05:05:59,170
I can't believe I beat this game.

4382
05:06:00,310 --> 05:06:06,930
I always, I thought that it would be, that I would have,
like, it would take me like three streams to beat it.

4383
05:06:08,190 --> 05:06:09,650
But no, I beat it.

4384
05:06:09,730 --> 05:06:10,690
Don't ignore that part.

4385
05:06:11,010 --> 05:06:12,010
Ignore don't look at that.

4386
05:06:12,150 --> 05:06:13,030
Don't look at the game over.

4387
05:06:16,070 --> 05:06:16,510
Congratulations.

4388
05:06:18,150 --> 05:06:19,010
Oh my god.

4389
05:06:20,270 --> 05:06:20,830
Okay.

4390
05:06:22,170 --> 05:06:23,150
Uh, give me a second.

4391
05:06:25,270 --> 05:06:25,830
Um.

4392
05:06:27,190 --> 05:06:28,510
One second, one second.

4393
05:06:29,350 --> 05:06:31,230
Uh, I gotta make us.

4394
05:06:32,930 --> 05:06:34,270
I gotta put everything up.

4395
05:06:34,430 --> 05:06:34,850
Hold on.

4396
05:06:34,930 --> 05:06:35,950
One second, you guys.

4397
05:06:36,750 --> 05:06:37,310
One second.

4398
05:06:37,470 --> 05:06:39,130
I gotta get the chat already.

4399
05:06:40,030 --> 05:06:40,710
Hold on.

4400
05:06:41,370 --> 05:06:41,850
Oh.

4401
05:06:42,730 --> 05:06:43,890
Wait, no, no, no.

4402
05:06:44,170 --> 05:06:45,170
I'm ruining everything.

4403
05:06:45,290 --> 05:06:46,110
Pop out chat.

4404
05:06:46,290 --> 05:06:46,790
There we go.

4405
05:06:47,830 --> 05:06:48,990
Gotta get everything ready.

4406
05:06:50,170 --> 05:06:51,290
Here we go.

4407
05:06:55,090 --> 05:06:56,290
Oh no, you can still hear it.

4408
05:06:58,190 --> 05:06:58,590
Oh no!

4409
05:06:58,970 --> 05:06:59,470
Stop!

4410
05:07:08,070 --> 05:07:08,590
Wow.

4411
05:07:09,310 --> 05:07:11,930
One second, let me also...

4412
05:07:13,030 --> 05:07:13,770
My computer.

4413
05:07:14,910 --> 05:07:15,850
There we go.

4414
05:07:17,450 --> 05:07:17,950
Oh!

4415
05:07:24,670 --> 05:07:27,710
I thought I was gonna be with you guys all day.

4416
05:07:28,850 --> 05:07:29,790
I mean, I kind of was.

4417
05:07:31,070 --> 05:07:31,610
But wow.

4418
05:07:33,490 --> 05:07:34,010
Congratulations.

4419
05:07:34,570 --> 05:07:35,570
Thank you.

4420
05:07:36,930 --> 05:07:38,110
The game is over.

4421
05:07:40,270 --> 05:07:41,350
Oh my goodness.

4422
05:07:45,540 --> 05:07:46,460
My goodness.

4423
05:07:47,340 --> 05:07:48,140
Wow, virulent.

4424
05:07:48,540 --> 05:07:53,340
I remember watching Corona Viening this live and it is an
honor and a privilege to see you doing it as well.

4425
05:07:53,860 --> 05:07:53,880
Congratulations.

4426
05:07:56,140 --> 05:08:01,060
God gave her want to try the way she did it because you guys
said it was more difficult.

4427
05:08:03,100 --> 05:08:07,340
Kind of curious how much more difficult it is.

4428
05:08:07,460 --> 05:08:16,180
I mean once you get the invincibility it's just like walk in
the park but um and I think I probably would have been stuck

4429
05:08:16,180 --> 05:08:22,640
on the on the poop rave more if I hadn't remembered where
the door was.

4430
05:08:22,860 --> 05:08:24,120
Not actually no I don't think.

4431
05:08:24,220 --> 05:08:24,320
I

4432
05:08:27,700 --> 05:08:42,060
rave more if I if I hadn't known where the door was so that
leap of faith was clutch I can't believe I cannot believe

4433
05:08:42,060 --> 05:08:51,520
that I did that last level in one shot I cannot believe
without invincibility it takes forever yeah I can imagine

4434
05:08:52,960 --> 05:09:06,660
but I'm curious the Korone San did the actual gamer way the
actual god gamer way maybe i took the easy way but oh wow it

4435
05:09:06,660 --> 05:09:22,820
was still it was still a time it was still a time oh oh wow
he's so loud oh my goodness sorry goodness gracious

4436
05:09:27,400 --> 05:09:31,080
I guess the real Atlantis no Nazo was the VTuber we gaslit
along the way.

4437
05:09:33,680 --> 05:09:35,660
It was hard either way, Minto.

4438
05:09:37,680 --> 05:09:39,560
Corrin, thanks.

4439
05:09:44,340 --> 05:09:44,960
Wow, we.

4440
05:09:50,360 --> 05:09:53,560
Corrin had to memorize the precise jump pattern to get
through it.

4441
05:09:54,800 --> 05:09:56,040
I want to try it.

4442
05:09:56,680 --> 05:09:58,300
Like I said, I like challenges.

4443
05:09:58,940 --> 05:10:00,140
And this was quite a challenge.

4444
05:10:00,800 --> 05:10:06,840
Nagoya equals three numbers It's the number It's the order
of statues you need to bomb to get the door that warps to

4445
05:10:06,840 --> 05:10:17,920
the end So it is Nagoya, 7, 3, 8 I bet Or I'm assuming Was
there even a single mermaid in this game?

4446
05:10:18,280 --> 05:10:19,880
There was the fish people, yeah!

4447
05:10:21,800 --> 05:10:23,000
There were the fish people!

4448
05:10:23,920 --> 05:10:24,760
The fish people!

4449
05:10:29,080 --> 05:10:31,480
11 hours The Fist and Darns would.

4450
05:10:31,800 --> 05:10:32,480
I, okay.

4451
05:10:35,120 --> 05:10:35,940
I don't know.

4452
05:10:36,100 --> 05:10:41,000
I prefer older rage games to newer rage games.

4453
05:10:41,220 --> 05:10:46,080
Because I feel like, I mean, not to say that older games
don't make them obtuse.

4454
05:10:46,680 --> 05:10:49,360
On, like, like on purpose.

4455
05:10:49,600 --> 05:10:51,100
Like, they are.

4456
05:10:51,520 --> 05:10:52,460
And they're still.

4457
05:10:53,600 --> 05:10:54,220
You know.

4458
05:10:55,120 --> 05:10:56,240
Angel, thank you.

4459
05:10:56,680 --> 05:10:58,440
Still, thanks for the chill stream.

4460
05:11:00,860 --> 05:11:09,180
but I don't know games that are made to be rage games are
different yeah I think so too right have you played echo the

4461
05:11:09,180 --> 05:11:22,940
dolphin yet oh my god I played that when I was a kid and it
scarred me that game my sister had a a the Sega Genesis

4462
05:11:23,700 --> 05:11:30,200
actually sorry it was the Sega nomad because the Genesis one
is the console or the like the home version right and the

4463
05:11:30,200 --> 05:11:43,640
nomad is the handheld we had the nomad and um we had we had
the Jurassic Park game Sonic 1 and 2 uh the Lion King game

4464
05:11:43,640 --> 05:11:53,320
which maybe I should try the Lion King game that is oh
actually oh my gosh I I think I could still play I think

4465
05:11:53,320 --> 05:11:56,160
there's still a way to play it I never got to play the
Winnie

4466
05:12:00,200 --> 05:12:01,160
The castle.

4467
05:12:03,460 --> 05:12:03,700
Maybe.

4468
05:12:05,400 --> 05:12:05,820
Maybe.

4469
05:12:12,520 --> 05:12:14,240
That Lion King game is hard.

4470
05:12:14,620 --> 05:12:16,260
It's so hard.

4471
05:12:16,720 --> 05:12:18,180
Maybe I should play the Lion King game.

4472
05:12:18,480 --> 05:12:20,360
And the Winnie the Pooh baseball game.

4473
05:12:21,240 --> 05:12:22,180
And yeah.

4474
05:12:22,300 --> 05:12:23,080
But we had that.

4475
05:12:23,420 --> 05:12:23,780
Lion King.

4476
05:12:24,900 --> 05:12:25,780
Jurassic Park.

4477
05:12:26,400 --> 05:12:30,180
We had a box with the Tasmanian Devil game.

4478
05:12:30,200 --> 05:12:34,900
which, ugh, I don't, but the game was not in there, luckily.

4479
05:12:36,960 --> 05:12:38,000
And we had Echo the Dolphin.

4480
05:12:38,220 --> 05:12:39,700
I don't think there was anything else that we had.

4481
05:12:41,280 --> 05:12:46,880
But I played a lot of Sonic, and I played a lot of Lion
King.

4482
05:12:48,120 --> 05:12:56,500
Actually, I played my good share of Echo and Jurassic Park
2.

4483
05:12:56,580 --> 05:12:57,740
And Jaco sticks with the 10 gifted!

4484
05:12:58,080 --> 05:12:59,880
M and Minto stands for masochist.

4485
05:13:01,040 --> 05:13:03,940
Lank in Game Gear is some deep kusum.

4486
05:13:08,060 --> 05:13:12,580
Yeah, maybe we'll have to play some more games like that.

4487
05:13:15,660 --> 05:13:16,900
The true...

4488
05:13:16,900 --> 05:13:18,200
The true...

4489
05:13:20,920 --> 05:13:21,860
Challenge games.

4490
05:13:22,020 --> 05:13:24,720
Sorry, my brain is melted right now.

4491
05:13:25,600 --> 05:13:28,440
My brain is so jelly right now.

4492
05:13:28,520 --> 05:13:29,800
Oh my gosh.

4493
05:13:32,900 --> 05:13:42,880
I feel like all the adrenaline just kind of crashed and now
I'm I did it Yippee!

4494
05:13:43,440 --> 05:13:44,200
Oh my gosh, Brick!

4495
05:13:44,440 --> 05:13:45,440
Thank you for the 50 gift!

4496
05:13:45,960 --> 05:13:46,400
Thank you!

4497
05:13:47,540 --> 05:13:49,120
Thank you so much!

4498
05:13:49,440 --> 05:13:50,420
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

4499
05:13:51,480 --> 05:13:52,680
Gratzen 200k, by the way.

4500
05:13:52,940 --> 05:13:53,620
Thank you so much!

4501
05:13:53,860 --> 05:13:54,480
Thank you!

4502
05:13:55,960 --> 05:13:58,500
Aladdin wasn't that cool, so I never played Aladdin yet.

4503
05:13:58,980 --> 05:14:00,080
I can make you a list.

4504
05:14:01,280 --> 05:14:04,860
If you want to post it in my general tag or my live tag.

4505
05:14:05,760 --> 05:14:06,420
Feel free.

4506
05:14:06,840 --> 05:14:07,720
Feel free.

4507
05:14:09,460 --> 05:14:11,080
But, uh, yeah.

4508
05:14:11,920 --> 05:14:13,500
I really thought I would be here all day.

4509
05:14:17,060 --> 05:14:18,780
Taki is all thanks for the dead gifted.

4510
05:14:19,740 --> 05:14:21,040
Those grippers can rest easy.

4511
05:14:21,200 --> 05:14:26,320
My hands are like, I'm like, I'm like opening and closing
them.

4512
05:14:26,580 --> 05:14:26,960
Like, okay.

4513
05:14:27,700 --> 05:14:28,820
All right, let's stretch.

4514
05:14:29,020 --> 05:14:29,740
Stretch them out.

4515
05:14:31,640 --> 05:14:33,420
Oh, wow.

4516
05:14:33,840 --> 05:14:34,400
Wait a second.

4517
05:14:34,600 --> 05:14:34,740
Uh-oh.

4518
05:14:41,370 --> 05:14:41,670
Um.

4519
05:14:43,710 --> 05:14:44,490
I'm okay.

4520
05:14:44,810 --> 05:14:45,390
Everything's good.

4521
05:14:46,010 --> 05:14:46,690
It's just texting.

4522
05:14:46,870 --> 05:14:48,150
Checking a text.

4523
05:14:49,450 --> 05:14:51,130
I'm meeting my...

4524
05:14:51,130 --> 05:14:52,630
I'm seeing my mom tomorrow.

4525
05:14:53,550 --> 05:14:55,570
But, um...

4526
05:14:56,310 --> 05:14:56,950
Uh...

4527
05:14:56,950 --> 05:14:59,870
I will be doing a Patreon...

4528
05:14:59,870 --> 05:15:01,050
Um...

4529
05:15:01,050 --> 05:15:02,270
Game tomorrow.

4530
05:15:02,590 --> 05:15:03,150
Uh...

4531
05:15:03,150 --> 05:15:05,310
You don't have to leave just yet.

4532
05:15:05,870 --> 05:15:05,990
Minecraft?

4533
05:15:07,610 --> 05:15:14,310
I'm still trying to find time to organize a collab so I can
get a tour of the V-Shojo Minecraft server, but I'm still

4534
05:15:14,310 --> 05:15:16,050
really scared of joining it.

4535
05:15:16,170 --> 05:15:18,310
It looks so intense with how many mods they have.

4536
05:15:21,830 --> 05:15:22,930
Tell your mom we said hi.

4537
05:15:23,070 --> 05:15:23,710
I will.

4538
05:15:24,890 --> 05:15:25,590
I will.

4539
05:15:27,310 --> 05:15:27,490
No.

4540
05:15:28,910 --> 05:15:30,190
Tomorrow is Mother's Day.

4541
05:15:31,910 --> 05:15:33,130
For I think a lot of people.

4542
05:15:34,630 --> 05:15:35,190
So...

4543
05:15:35,190 --> 05:15:36,850
Wildest duck, thanks for the Tony gifted!

4544
05:15:38,510 --> 05:15:39,390
Thank you!

4545
05:15:40,430 --> 05:15:43,370
You learned base Minecraft from nothing, you'll learn mods
too?

4546
05:15:43,970 --> 05:15:44,270
Okay.

4547
05:15:44,990 --> 05:15:45,330
Okay.

4548
05:15:45,850 --> 05:15:49,570
I'm also nervous because there's like a lot of people on the
server that I don't know.

4549
05:15:49,790 --> 05:15:51,830
So I'm like, shy.

4550
05:15:54,870 --> 05:15:55,430
But...

4551
05:15:56,430 --> 05:15:56,990
Um...

4552
05:15:56,990 --> 05:15:57,570
Yeah.

4553
05:16:00,090 --> 05:16:02,370
I've seen their server mods, it's so cool.

4554
05:16:06,770 --> 05:16:14,330
I have to, I've seen a little bit of it, but I think it's
mostly like the crazy, I'm, I already, I already feel like I

4555
05:16:14,330 --> 05:16:22,450
don't utilize the crafting to its potential in regular
Minecraft, so I'm like, oh gosh, when it's modded, I'm going

4556
05:16:22,450 --> 05:16:25,810
to be like, a dirt house.

4557
05:16:28,530 --> 05:16:29,250
Dirt house.

4558
05:16:32,150 --> 05:16:33,030
Scary time.

4559
05:16:33,150 --> 05:16:34,110
Thank you!

4560
05:16:34,290 --> 05:16:35,230
Thanks for one month!

4561
05:16:37,050 --> 05:16:41,670
But yeah, um, next week, um, will be a bit of a shorter
week, actually.

4562
05:16:43,770 --> 05:16:50,010
Um, but I have a collab with my beloved Ayami Sensei!

4563
05:16:50,690 --> 05:16:51,730

4566
05:16:57,650 --> 05:17:01,250
Um, I'll be streaming Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then

What's the collab?

4576
05:17:56,150 --> 05:17:57,210
You'll just have to see.

4577
05:17:58,170 --> 05:18:01,390
It's actually, uh, not really a game, so...

4578
05:18:03,150 --> 05:18:05,170
was mad when my fallout one got corrupted.

4579
05:18:05,390 --> 05:18:06,550
Oh, I'm sorry.

4580
05:18:06,950 --> 05:18:08,910
I know, that would really frustrate me, too.

4581
05:18:09,550 --> 05:18:10,290
My birthday's on Monday.

4582
05:18:10,410 --> 05:18:11,230
