00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,700
I don't like seeing him depressed.

70
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,960
What are you talking about?

71
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,040

72
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,500

73
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,540

Sorry, I meant every, every, every, sorry, I was thinking of
our company parties.

77
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,560
They're done on leap years.

78
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:18,240
Well, sorry, what I was thinking was we only do them once a,
once a century.

79
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,740
So, and that was like at the beginning of the century, the
turn of the century.

80
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,820
So, you might want to like come back in a couple of years,
you know.

81
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,540
and we'll try and validate it for you.

82
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,160
We got in the broom closet ending.

83
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,600
The broom closet ending is my favorite.

84
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,300
I believe I did before, but of course we can get things
again.

85
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,280
You got those photos printed?

86
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:46,940
Fogos printed?

87
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,020
You got 100 page review of Nacho Libre on my desk by EOD.

88
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,660
Raymac, you weren't even there.

89
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,900
You weren't even there.

90
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,980
I don't want to hear it from you.

91
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,720
I did my report.

92
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,440
You just weren't there to see it.

93
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,000
Anyway, let's begin the game, baby.

94
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,520
No way, the call out?

95
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,400
You're next to us.

96
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,600
This is the story of a man named Stanley.

97
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,040
Mint.

98
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,600
Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was
employee number 427.

99
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,980
Employee number 427's job was...

100
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:36,800
desk in room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard orders
came to him through a monitor on his desk telling him what

101
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:44,380
buttons to push how long to push them and in what order oh
my god this is what employee that's really specific though

102
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:52,400
every day every month of every year and although others
might have considered it soul-rending standing the music is

103
00:12:52,400 --> 00:13:01,100
so funky it's like giving me simpsons a little bit i don't
know why And Stanley was happy.

104
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,240
He was happy.

105
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,000
And then one day, something very peculiar happened.

106
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,020
Something that would forever change Stanley.

107
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,520
Something he would never quite forget.

108
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,560
He had been at his desk for nearly an hour.

109
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:21,820
When he realized that not one single order had arrived on
the monitor for him to follow.

110
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,300
No one had showed up to give him instructions.

111
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,580
Call a meeting.

112
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,460
Or even say hi.

113
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,040
No.

114
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:37,000
in all his years at the company had this happened this
complete isolation something was very clearly wrong wrong

115
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:45,360
shocked frozen solid stanley found himself unable to move
for the longest time but as he came to his wits and regained

116
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:54,380
his senses sentience he got up from his desk and stepped out
of his office you can't tell me what to do mister inspired

117
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:00,180
me to play through all of metal gear solid games let's go
i'm on three now and loving every second of it I'm so glad!

118
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,040
Oh my god.

119
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,000
Thank you for that.

120
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,340
Okay, thank you.

121
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,620
What if I don't want to leave my office?

122
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:14,360
What if I want to have I hate Monday's coffee?

123
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,320
10 a.m.

124
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,300
early morning.

125
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,860
It was a matter of principle.

126
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,740
He wanted to click it.

127
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,000
Close the door.

128
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,020
But Stanley simply couldn't handle the pressure.

129
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:35,500
The pressure!

130
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,880
What if you had to make a decision?

131
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,960
What if a crucial outcome fell under his responsibility?

132
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,980
He had never been trained for that.

133
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:42,640
No.

134
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,500
This couldn't go any way except badly.

135
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,880
The thing to do now, Stanley thought to himself, is to wait.

136
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,460
Is to wait.

137
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,560
Nothing will hurt me.

138
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:50,960
Yeah.

139
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,000
Nothing will break me.

140
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,360
Oh, wait.

141
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:52,760
There's...

142
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,920
Okay, shut up!

143
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
For ever!

144
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,340
Shut up!

145
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,260
I'm supposed to be doing the commentary!

146
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:57,660
Stop!

147
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,280
Stanley waited!

148
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:58,620
Stop!

149
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,120
Oh my god, please!

150
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,940
Okay, shut up.

151
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:01,400
Shut up!

152
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,740
Oh, uh-oh.

153
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,220
Oh, no!

154
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,020
He no longer had the ability to tell.

155
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,280
Ah!

156
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:11,460
But the one thing he knew for sure, beyond any doubt, was
that if he waited long enough, the answers would come.

157
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,620
Eventually, someday, they would arrive.

158
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,200
Uh-oh.

159
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,060
Soon, very soon now, this will end.

160
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,760
He will be spoken to.

161
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,200
Oh, my God.

162
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,920
He will be told what to do.

163
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,700
You're speaking too much!

164
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,200
Now it's just a little bit closer.

165
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,420
Now it's even closer.

166
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,580
Here it comes.

167
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,260
Ah!

168
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,100
The end is never the end, is never the end, is never the
end.

169
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,380
No, I was reading this.

170
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,540
The G814 Partition Corp.

171
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,420
Providing partitions for 56 years.

172
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,540
Wow, who knew that we needed partitions for so long?

173
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,500
The phone makes a strange sound.

174
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,380
Oh.

175
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,100
Why is that to the picture frame?

176
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,960
What the...

177
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,860
I hear typing sounds everywhere.

178
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,720
No matter what I look at.

179
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,380
Love the new suit.

180
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,440
Thank you!

181
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,380
The narrator is the commentary.

182
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,780
She finally left us to go back to the office.

183
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,580
Nothing.

184
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,600
Nothing.

185
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,100
My friend!

186
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:28,860
My friend!

187
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,420
428 doesn't even give it a window.

188
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,360
They hate him.

189
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,500
What could it mean?

190
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,040
Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.

191
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,880
Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.

192
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,480
Yeah, of course.

193
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,980
It's a memorial day, duh!

194
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,860
This is the automated... automated cleaner invoice.

195
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,060
Your crimson entrance at WrestleTuber has now been dealt
with.

196
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,840
No further actions needed.

197
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,520
Thank you.

198
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,980
No matter how hard Stanley looked, he couldn't find a trace
of his co-workers.

199
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:23,020
who farted why are there mugs like this number one dad oh
wait he's downloading something oh shit oh god oh god oh god

200
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:36,280
my bad my bad number one dad my bad dad oh god I like work
work I just hate My boss!

201
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,760
That's so bad.

202
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,860
Won't your boss see that?

203
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,660
Rip number one, dad.

204
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,180
Turn off all their computers.

205
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:52,800
Wait!

206
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:58,060
Stanley went around touching every little thing in the
office, but it didn't make a single difference.

207
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,240
Nor did it advance the story in any way.

208
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,540
Hmm.

209
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,820
Okay, thank you.

210
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,300
five gifted speedifier.

211
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,960
I forgot how sassy.

212
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,840
Stanley clicked on literally every single door in the office
because he doesn't pick up well on queues from his

213
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,440
environment.

214
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,560
Shut up!

215
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,880
Why can't I explore?

216
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,660
Vodgang here.

217
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,380
Thank you!

218
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,040
I canceled his illegal movie download.

219
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,380
Justice.

220
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,880
This guy escaped.

221
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,160
417 is in the ceiling.

222
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,240
I hate my nose.

223
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:41,900
Okay.

224
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,540
This is the meeting room.

225
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,200
Just kidding.

226
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,280
Oh, no.

227
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,940
Oh, no, it's this.

228
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,920
It's this.

229
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,400
It's this.

230
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,060
It's this.

231
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,640
Hmm.

232
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,060
Am I a good girl?

233
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,640
Am I a good Stanley or am I bad Stanley?

234
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,800
It's the choice.

235
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,720
Am I a good girl?

236
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,260
Or am I a bad girl?

237
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,840
Bad Stanley.

238
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,380
Oh, my eyes.

239
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,100
Always a good Stanley.

240
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,600
Even if I don't, even if I lose my way?

241
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,720
This was not the correct way to the meeting room, and
Stanley knew it perfectly well.

242
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,120
Perhaps he wanted to stop by the employee lounge first, just
to admire it.

243
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,840
Of course, of course.

244
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,000
Oh, I see.

245
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,440
I want to go in there.

246
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,420
I want to go back there.

247
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,400
Hmm.

248
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,560
Oh, here we go.

249
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,380
The lounge.

250
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,500
Yes, truly a room worth admiring.

251
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,100
Oh, yes.

252
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,220
It had really been worth the detour after all.

253
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,600
Just to spend a few moments here in this immaculate,
beautifully constructed room.

254
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,880
Stanley simply stood here, drinking it all in.

255
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:13,700
Uh, smells like, smells like yesterday's perfume.

256
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,520
Yes, really, really worth it being here in the room.

257
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:24,440
A room so utterly captivating that even though all your
co-workers have mysteriously vanished, here you sit looking

258
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,160
at these chairs and some paintings.

259
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,580
Really worth it.

260
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,400
It is.

261
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,400
Just love that, like, that 10 a.m.

262
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,440
That...

263
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,720
At this point, Stan is obsession with this room.

264
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,940
worded and reflected poorly on his overall personality it's
possible that this is why everyone left now you're judging

265
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:55,640
my character 125 for drinks is pretty good i don't know
stanley sat around waiting for more dialogue but when a long

266
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:03,960
time had passed and there was no more he decided that the
game was trying to send him a message yeah look you got your

267
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,980
you got this is where i always sit they say this is stand
seat.

268
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:08,980
That's what it says.

269
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,100
You can't see it, but it's written right there.

270
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,480
There's also... They got the stain out pretty good.

271
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,780
They say, that's stand seat.

272
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,260
And then this, this is...

273
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,480
This is big old Joe seat.

274
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,400
You know, he's just a... He's like the biggest guy you'll
ever meet.

275
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,420
What is this actually?

276
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,280
What is it?

277
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:31,860
Wait.

278
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,080
What?

279
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,460
What is...

280
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,940
What is if...

281
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,220
Duet the plane.

282
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,420
The weeks?

283
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,940
Hi, I'm hungry.

284
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,060
Is that what it says at the bottom?

285
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,000
Time to zoom.

286
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:49,960
I can't zoom.

287
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,920
Is there a zoom button?

288
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,320
Oh.

289
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,420
Is there a zoom?

290
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,380
You can look closer.

291
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,040
How do I do that?

292
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,740
Also, if I press right click, I move forward too.

293
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,680
That's kind of crazy.

294
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:02,620
Z?

295
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,560
Oh, right click makes me walk forward.

296
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:26,500
hmm let's check the keybinds real quick oh it's auto walk
okay there is a jump interesting interact maybe additional

297
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:38,920
nope okay but at last he'd had enough of the amazing room
and took the first open door on his left look i'm auto

auto walking or am i walking walking

300
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:14,680

the maintenance walk straight ahead to the opposite door

301
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:30,500
back on track wait what's here we what is this but Stanley
didn't want to go back to the office he wanted to wander

302
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:37,020
about and get even further off track so now in order to get
back he needed to go well

303

interact oh no no no it's to the right my mistake oh

We just got it.

312
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:22,860
We're fine.

313
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,300
This story is absolutely, definitely this way.

314
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,280
This way.

315
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,040
Someone in there?

316
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,840
Ooh, it's kind of spooky down here though, you guys.

317
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,520
Oh wait!

318
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,860
Oh my gosh, we're... Oh, I remember this room!

319
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,320
Fired.

320
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,840
That's not me.

321
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this isn't right at
all.

322
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:48,540
Oopsie!

323
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,740
You're not supposed to be here yet.

324
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,920
This is all a spoiler.

325
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,900
Oh, sorry.

326
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:52,480
Close your eyes.

327
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,020
I'm closing.

328
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,640
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

329
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,000
We just have to get back to, um, oh.

330
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,460
Who am I kidding?

331
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,800
It's all rubbish.

332
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,600
I went to the spoiler before saying!

333
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,480
It's completely unusable.

334
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,820
How about rather than waste my time trying to salvage this
nonsense, we'll just restart the game from the beginning.

335
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,060
And this time, suppose we don't wander so far off track.

336
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:24,220
hmm okay from the top okay we're good stanley all of his
co-workers were gone what could it mean stanley decided to

337
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:32,140

00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:29,660
okay I'm exploring mm-hmm inner guilt

345
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:41,700
everyone knows what you did they're just holding back to let
you torture this is the worst adventure I've ever been on I

346
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,960
can promise you there definitely was a story here before Are
you sure?

347
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,680
Do we need to restart the game again?

348
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:53,120
I find it unlikely that we'll ever progress by starting over
and over again.

349
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,040
Wait a second!

350
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,800
Oh, come on.

351
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:56,500
No!

352
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,050
All of his co-workers were gone.

353
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,370
What could it mean?

354
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,710
Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.

355
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,230
I just hate my boss.

356
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,330
Okay.

357
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,230
Beelining.

358
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,010
Beelining.

359
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:14,810
Beelining.

360
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,790
And there's no doors.

361
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:28,390
it's worse I'm happy remembering this wrong it's possible
the story is back where we just came from why don't we go

362
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:46,050
back the other direction and see if we missed anything okay
in this room in this room 415 never liked that guy 417 it's

363
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,110
definitely in the in the walls

364
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:10,750
in here in here in here that looks so important in there
okay never mind um in here no aha I knew we'd miss something

365
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:21,970
the story here it comes okay no wait never mind not the
story Okay, let's head back the other way and retrace our

366
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:22,510
steps.

367
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,330
That's what I just did.

368
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:25,810
Mr. Narrator.

369
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,090
Mr. Narrator!

370
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:28,270
Ow!

371
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,810
Oh my god, Mr. Narrators.

372
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,130
Now this...

373
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:33,870
Well, I'll be honest.

374
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,330
I don't recognize this place at all.

375
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,650
Is this the story?

376
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,990
I don't think so.

377
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:38,690
I'm back...

378
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:42,470
I can't quite recall, but I believe my story took place in
an office building.

379
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,030
Is that correct?

380
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,630
I'm back on the farm.

381
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:46,750
Do you remember, Stanley?

382
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,670
I don't know anything.

383
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:58,250
completely forgotten what we were supposed to be doing okay
how about this this you win I beat the game I know you put

384
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:08,930
in a lot of hard work and it really paid off so good job oh
oh oh I don't feel right about this at all speed run no you

385
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:14,670
didn't put in any actual work for that oh it's gone some
people win fair and square and this was not one of those

386
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:19,430
situations okay I'm getting weirded out is.

387
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,490
I don't care what might happen this time.

388
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,330
I have to restart.

389
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,090
Alright.

390
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,510
I've got a solution.

391
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:36,290
This time to make sure we don't get lost, I've employed the
help of the Stanley Parable Adventure Line!

392
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:37,870
Just follow the line.

393
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,290
How simple is that?

394
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:39,630
Okay.

395
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,170
I sure hope nothing happens with this line.

396
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:45,970
Oh, this way.

397
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,490
This way.

398
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:58,490
this way this way you see the line knows where the story is
it's over in this direction onwards Stanley to destiny to

399
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:06,030
destiny here's a thought wouldn't wherever we end up be our
destination even if there's no story there or to put it

400
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:14,450
another way is the story of a little creative still a story
simply by the act of moving forward are we implying a

401
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:21,530
journey such that a destination is inevitably conjured into
being via the very manifestation of the nature of life

402
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:31,490
itself well thanks Rico that got a bit weird back there I'd
like to apologize Johnny Bravo should make the lead line

403
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,790
something really pretty right now that way it leads to you

404
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,470
Pass through here, oh my god, I can't even hear myself,
thank you.

405
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:09,990
Oh!

406
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,170
Around here.

407
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,970
Um, consul- consul- cons- c- c- c- c- c- c-reports!

408
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:19,950
Wow!

409
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,250
Employee 432 peer reviews!

410
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,130
That's- is that me?

411
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,530
Financial records!

412
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,870
Wait, wait, which- wait, this way.

413
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:30,430
This way, right?

414
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,470
Wait, cut the music.

415
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,070
Oh, thank God.

416
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,650
Go back and look at that fern.

417
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,470
Look at the what?

418
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:41,630
The fern?

419
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:43,770
What?

420
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,630
The fern?

421
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,470
Stanley, this fern will be very important later in the
story.

422
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,550
Make sure you study it closely and remember it carefully.

423
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,310
You won't want to miss anything.

424
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,600
Glory to the fern.

425
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,160
I got a certain ghostmate keychain that was QAF but keeps
rummaging my kitchen at night.

426
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,160
I think it's haunted.

427
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,740
What do I do?

428
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,180
It's probably best to like appease those sorts of things,
you know?

429
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:28,620
Wait, what?

430
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,040
We're back at the office?

431
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,280
No, no, no.

432
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:32,580
Wait.

433
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,560
You do know we're looking for the Stanley Parable, right?

434
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,320
The story?

435
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,720
Is any of this ringing a bell?

436
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,180
I'm still going.

437
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,500
The line is my destiny.

438
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:43,920
Oh.

439
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,900
No way.

440
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,920
Cool school, thanks for the 10 gifted!

441
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,900
Oh, no, no, no, no, not again.

442
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,780
Line, how could you have done this to us?

443
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,500
What's that one over there?

444
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,940
After everything we've been through, you...

445
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,300
Oh, I can't take this anymore.

446
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,100
How the hell with it?

447
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,220
Restart.

448
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:01,820
Ah!

449
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,320
The line wanted spoilers.

450
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:09,920
Okay.

451
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,440
You know what, Stanley?

452
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,600
I say forget the adventure line.

453
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,920
What's it ever done for us?

454
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,180
Hey, hey.

455
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,520
We're intelligent people, right?

456
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,720
Why can't we make up our own story?

457
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,560
exciting, daring, mysterious.

458
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,360
Oh, this all sounds perfectly doable.

459
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,300
Why don't we simply start wandering in, well, I don't know.

460
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,320
How about this direction?

461
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,800
This direction?

462
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,600
Well, I don't really have a choice now, do I?

463
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,920
Now, this is exciting.

464
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,460
Just me and Stanley, forging a new path, a new story.

465
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,600
This is really back rooms as... What do you want our story
to be?

466
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,880
Go wild.

467
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,600
Use your imagination.

468
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,700
I don't think you want that near either.

469
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:59,500
ready for it okay all right setting dingy dingy office
they're they're about to go out of business they're they are

470
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:06,720
let's see what are they what kind of business do they do
they do the real top business they're they're they're really

471
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:15,780
business business but they're just not doing so well because
because bigger business has moved in on their turf bigger

472
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:22,280
business has moved in on their turf and so So they're just
like, man, we're just, we're just, I don't know if we're

473
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,940
going to make it.

474
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:29,560
So the business employee is just like, I, we can't go out of
business.

475
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,400
This is my livelihood.

476
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,960
How will I feed my kids?

477
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,600
And so they're just like, well, what do you want to do about
it?

478
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,760
And are they a gang?

479
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,620
Stop, no spoilers.

480
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,720
And so they, yeah, bigger business, Inc.

481
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,760
Business is business.

482
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:55,500
um so uh to get to to get rid of the other biz bigger
business um they thought well you know maybe we should make

483
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:01,120
a better product but no it's not good enough bigger business
does better business not not better business they just do

484
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:09,000
bigger bigger business bigger business so big that it even
covers so much of the business and so instead they have to

485
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:17,220
kill them it's time to take down bigger business bigger
business has to be eliminated and so they start they start

486
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:27,540
shipping let's see they start shipping rats with the black
ah sorry I just tried to get some chapstick out and it just

487
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,060
squirted everywhere

488
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:42,870
rats with what the black plague do you guys know it's still
possible to get the Nowadays.

489
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,230
I learned that the hard way.

490
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,050
I don't know where I was going with that.

491
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,790
Oh no, not you again.

492
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:57,730
Oh, Stanley.

493
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:02,190
I'd also like to veto the line from having any role in our
awesome new story.

494
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,290
No lines or monitor rooms.

495
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:05,890
Just don't acknowledge it.

496
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,330
Okay.

497
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,010
You should be fine.

498
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:10,550
I'm not gonna even, I'm not gonna even like look at it.

499
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:25,830
guys I think I should start a business hmm spooky company
always monitoring what do we monitor you ask every type of

500
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:33,570
we get to make a decision from here the story is in our
control how important we mustn't squander the opportunity in

501
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:41,790
fact I believe I need a minute to think here just walk in
circles for a minute okay So I know that each door has to

502
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:47,250
lead somewhere, which means that somewhere the place where
we're trying to go...

503
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,530
There must be a reverse door that leads here.

504
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,830
No, no, no, spooky company always monitoring.

505
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:58,410
...means that our destination corresponds with the
counter-inverted reverse door's origin.

506
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:04,890
So starting from the right, let us ask, will taking the
right door lead us to where we're going?

507
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:08,890
And since the answer is clearly yes, then by all accounts...

508
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:15,010
the door on the right is the correct one already making
profit with this business great job mint come stanley our

509
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,290
destiny awaits

510
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:35,250
the confusion ending you've been playing the this confusion
ending for 19 minutes the confusion ending you're telling me

511
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:43,370
first restart that's what this is this is just it's all one
giant ending it's all been scripted to me eight eight times

512

really getting a head start investing on some spooky company

516

whatever it is

519
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,110
Will someone come for us?

520
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:44,750
Will something happen?

521
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,230
This guy loves to hear himself talk.

522
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,930
After a long time, Stanley dies!

523
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,310
Wait, there, Raider!

524
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,510
I don't want to die!

525
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,990
I'm already dead!

526
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:54,970
I'm not ready.

527
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,650
I suppose in some way that this is a kind of story, wouldn't
you agree?

528
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:02,190
I'm not quite sure if we're in the destination or the
journey.

529
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:06,210
Though they're always saying that life is about the journey
and not the destination.

530
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:06,550
Right.

531
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,790
So I hope that's where we are right now.

532
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:09,490
In the journey.

533
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,510
We'll find out, won't we?

534
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,750
Find an identical preplica.

535
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,250
Well, in the meantime, if you don't...

536
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:19,910
Okay.

537
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,350
We've restarted the game, everybody.

538
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:26,090
All of his co-workers were gone.

539
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,050
What could it mean?

540
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,170
I think he's saying.

541
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,830
Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.

542
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,470
Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.

543
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,230
I think he's normal.

544
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,110
I think he's normal.

545
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,730
Are you normal, Mr. Narrator?

546
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,070
Oh, yes.

547
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:42,810
When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the
door on his left.

548
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:51,730
left and decided to go to the meeting room hey you can't
tell me what to do

person here oh tips for not getting feeling a wave of

552
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:19,830
disbelief Stanley decided to go unbelievably amazing work
all the time every day with no hoping he might find an

553
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:24,610
answer there not to solve a dispute with the co-worker let
it ball up inside you take it out passive aggressively on

554
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:33,170
other co-workers resent co-workers for not supporting you

We have floats.

576
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,670
Push for funding for... R&D.

577
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:08,410
Wait.

578
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,750

00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:15,290
We have enough GMP for this?

581
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:18,330
Get Chris out of the broom closet.

582
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:20,490
The bloons closet.

583
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,750
The giant blow-up doll in the sky?

584
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,070
No!

585
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:32,850
Standardized graphs 440x wide.

586
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,230
Not cost efficient.

587
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,630
Papers are too synergized.

588
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,810
Fire paper guy.

589
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,250

Who moved my deck?

593
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:55,750

primary review schedule.

601
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,460
But I think that's a stupid idea.

602
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,320
More water coolers, more water cooler heaters.

603
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,980
Charts need to be more hip to appeal to teenage demographic.

604
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,880
Find teenagers to put in teenage demographic.

605
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,200
Big net, some sort of child trap.

606
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,360
Size of demographic.

607
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,720
Can't really read what it says.

608
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:26,980
Space.

609
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,080
Between the teenagers.

610
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:33,700
Teenagers.

611
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,420
Throw something in the idea's bin.

612
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,140
No more bins.

613
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,380
Trash cans.

614
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,120
Renaming of the idea bin.

615
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,760
Firing of me.

616
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,820
Oh, oh.

617
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,560
Better safe than profits.

618
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:51,640
No, not.

619
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Ignore that, everybody.

620
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:53,960
Profits are everything.

621
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:55,920
Business club.

622
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:56,520
Rule one.

623
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,380
References are not all there.

624
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:08,680
are cracked up to be i didn't know that there was writing
behind you it's like funny crafts about things and money

625
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,280
these people oh my gosh

626
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:23,510
i think i have a thing or two to learn about this great this
place oh wasn't there somebody locked in here stanley

627
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:32,730
stepped into the broom closet but there was nothing here oh
wait i remember this one and got back on track no just gonna

628
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:40,110
chill in here for a bit you know just gonna there was
nothing here no choice to make no path to follow just an

629
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:47,950
empty broom closet just an empty broom closet it's not empty
though look at this they he is devaluing your existence

630
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:55,790
broom and closet and bucket that's baffling that stanley was
still just sitting in the broom closet he wasn't even doing

631
00:45:55,790 --> 00:46:02,590
anything at least if there was something to interact with
he'd be justified in some way as it is he's literally just

632
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:15,510
standing there doing sweet fa what's fa just a room closet
are you really still in the broom closet standing around

633
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:23,510
doing nothing why please offer me some explanation here i'm
i'm genuinely confused oh well you know there's a lot of

634
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:29,070
good things there's a lot of good qualities about every room
in a building you know every room should have a purpose

635
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:35,910
realize there's no choice or anything in here right that's
okay i'm just admiring its value past the broom closet at

636
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:41,630
least you would have had a reason for exploring it to find
out but it didn't even occur to me because literally this

637
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:50,170
closet is of absolutely no significance to the story
whatsoever i never would have thought to mention it then

638
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:58,350
why'd you create it why did you give it life why did you
give it an existence now this to you this is somehow its own

639
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:07,090
no maybe when you go talk about this with your friends or
say oh did you get the broom closet ending did you get the

640
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:20,090
broom closet ending I hope your friends find this concerning
no I'm admiring it was that Stanley was fat and ugly and

641
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:26,670
really really stupid he probably only got the job because of
a family connection that's I'm a nipple baby that all with

642
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:36,850
drug money also Stanley is addicted to drugs and hookers oh
yeah Stanley living the life well I've come to a very

643
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:44,070
definite conclusion about what's going on right now you're
dead mm-hmm you got to this broom closet explored it a bit

644
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:50,390
and we're just about to leave because there's nothing here
when a physical melody of some sort shut down your central

645
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:56,910
nervous system and you collapsed on the keyboard yep well in
a situation like this the responsible thing is to alert

646
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:02,990
someone nearby so as to ensure that that your body is taken
care of before it begins to decompose.

647
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:04,250
Decompose.

648
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:09,310
Anyone who happens to be nearby, the person at this computer
is dead.

649
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:09,850
I'm dead!

650
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:14,430
Therefore, pray to any number of your countless human
physiological vulnerabilities.

651
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:18,750
It's indicative of the long-term sustainability of your
species.

652
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:25,590
Please remove their corpse from the area and instruct
another human to take their place, making sure they

653
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:32,710
understand basic, first-person video game mechanics, and
filling them in on the history of narrative tropes in video

654
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:39,490
gaming, so that the irony and insightful commentary of this
game is not lost on them.

655
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,550
Thanks, narrator.

656
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,730
When you've done that, just step out into the hallway.

657
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:47,970
What am I supposed to do?

658
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:58,450
I am understanding the irony and the intricate commentary of
this...

659
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:08,390
this uh situation loved your wrestling you brought in my
basement thanks fam thanks for reminding glad you liked my

660
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:24,420
wrestling ah second play you too unbelievable i'm at the
mercy of an entire species of invalids perhaps there's a

661
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:30,700
monkey nearby you can hand the controls to the fish you've
decided to not move on you can hammer out the details i'm

662
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,860
not particularly happy i think i'll just be waiting for when
you're ready to pick up the story again.

663
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,100
Nah, nah, yeah.

664
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,440
I'm an invalid.

665
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:38,840
I'm an invalid.

666
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:39,560
I'm an invalid.

667
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,500
I'm, um, I'm, I don't know.

668
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,240
I'm, it's my destiny to be in the broom closet.

669
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:54,370
I think I'm pretty valid, though.

670
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:59,010
Look, the, the, the light kind of just reminds me of the
sun.

671
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:05,970
But you're not really supposed to stare at, but, you know,
when you just look at it, it's just like, you know, Maybe

672
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:13,470
the sky turned like an ashy brown and the sun is around.

673
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:15,630
You can just imagine it.

674
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:21,050
You can just think of yourself being outside and living a
free life.

675
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:22,070
You know?

676
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:28,370
You don't have to stay confined to these walls.

677
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:29,930
You are so valid.

678
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:30,990
Thank you.

679
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:34,230
Joe, look at the bamboo chup.

680
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:40,750
You can just look at the sun and you can just ponder.

681
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:48,490
You can be like, I'm just this tiny, insignificant creature
in this vast, vast, endless universe.

682
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:55,010
But in this moment, I feel like I'm one with the universe.

683
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:56,650
Is there anything else to do?

684
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:57,790
Am I done?

685
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,000
Oh.

686
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:26,290
What does that sound?

687
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:29,710
God, I'm scared of the outside world.

688
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:31,110
The broom closet's best.

689
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:34,230
Uh.

690
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:37,870
Hmm.

691
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:44,650
Coming to a staircase, Stanley walked upstairs to his boss's
office.

692
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:46,490
Oh.

693
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:48,410
No!

694
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:52,330
Please, narrator, please, please, please.

695
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:53,870
I'm on my knees, I'm begging you, please.

696
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:55,890
Let me go back to the broom closet.

697
00:51:59,010 --> 00:51:59,450
Please!

698
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:04,450
No!

699
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,430
Wind install.

700
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:11,170
What did he say?

701
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:11,990
What did he tell me?

702
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,410
Sorry, Mr. Narrator.

703
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,550
I'm not really paying attention.

704
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:16,050
Ooh.

705
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:17,950
This area is so spooky.

706
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:22,130
Upstairs.

707
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:23,070
Oh, upstairs.

708
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:23,590
Thank you.

709
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,140
Is there actually a broom closet ending though or...

710
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:35,700
Oh, I remember this room kind of.

711
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,220
It's the bathroom.

712
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,060
I've got the feeling.

713
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,740
I've got a feeling.

714
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,020
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

715
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,440
That money is for stealing.

716
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,300
That money is for stealing.

717
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,680
Money is for stealing.

718
00:52:59,220 --> 00:52:59,920
A feeling.

719
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:14,080
but not your money of course not your time extreme bathrooms
say that's a lovely purse

720
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,800
mr crabs felt that

721
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:32,360
oh my god the panda business strategy

722
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:36,180
strategy.

723
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,580
Take out the competition.

724
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:40,200
Oh.

725
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,340
Which way are we going?

726
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,320
Stanley.

727
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,220
Two, three, four.

728
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,860
What did I say?

729
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,600
I can't hear you.

730
00:54:54,840 --> 00:55:08,740
Could you speak up a little louder yeah could you say your
words enunciate instead of a mumbling I don't understand

731
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:26,660
what you're trying to say to me I don't know the words to
the song but I know that those words will be created in my

732
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,980
heart for you baby girl

733
00:55:53,700 --> 00:56:08,240
this is the longest elevator in the world but it's not as
long as my love for you

734
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:23,800
in this world this world machine that's what I would say I
don't

735
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:53,200
know what do you say does this actually end I don't know oh
recommendations from the overnight committee oh we're going

736
00:56:53,200 --> 00:57:18,190
again in circles around each other and our love is burning
But I'm doing here without you But I know that I'll see you

737
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:30,570
tonight I don't know if I should stop it or not

738
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:38,990
there okay boom

739
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,740
it's glowing slow because the weight limit is being reached
it's just you and the elevator right

740
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:15,740
i shot them i shot them with an arrow of love just like me
Just so smitten for you, girl.

741
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:27,730
Oh, come on!

742
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,340
I am the most expensive, boss.

743
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,920
If I go down.

744
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,360
Bo-do!

745
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:47,950
Thanks for making the elevator go slow, Mr. Narrative.

746
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:10,870
What's the equivalent for sticky different elevators?

747
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:17,150
Solid Cupid and their 5.56 rifle of love.

748
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:21,090
What a thrill.

749
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:27,350
Silence and darkness rule the night.

750
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:45,140
I can't remember the lyrics if I'm not like, if I'm not like
singing it.

751
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,060
What a thrill, what a thrill.

752
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:55,060
With darkness and silence through the night.

753
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,080
Oh you.

754
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:05,200
I'm searching and I'll melt into you, baby girl.

755
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,040
It's really a mountain.

756
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:29,320
would have would fear my heart but you're so supreme oh yes
i give my love not for honor but for you

757
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:15,800
um business time oh business time our hostile takeover is
the new bi-annual percentage two votes snake eater bossa

758
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:29,800
nova elevator remix the beige pages stepping into his
manager's office again stunned to discover not an indication

759
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,980
of any human life.

760
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,360
Switched lilies by Claude Manie.

761
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,680
Unraveled, Stanley wondered in disbelief who orchestrated
this.

762
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,120
What dark secret was being held from him?

763
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:39,920
Mont Blanc.

764
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:46,520
What he could not have known was that the keypad behind the
boss's desk guarded the terrible truth that his boss had

765
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,740
been keeping from him.

766
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:52,200
And so the boss had assigned it an extra secret pin number.

767
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:54,860
Two, eight, four, five.

768
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,300
couldn't possibly have known this.

769
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:07,380
Boob.

770
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,300
Stanley just sat around twiddling his thumbs.

771
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:20,680
Trying to input anything on the device was useless, since he
could never possibly know that the combination was

772
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,300
two-eight-four-five.

773
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,160
Surely we'll find it out.

774
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:28,000
Okay, there's two kangaroos here.

775
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:28,940
Two.

776
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:32,180
Two-eight-four-five.

777
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,720
Two-eight-four-five.

778
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:49,620
um there's a cat two of three um um oh there's a globe
around the world in 80 days eight but it turns out that the

779
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:56,960
panel's emergency override kicked in and the door just
opened all by itself and stanley got the hell along with the

780
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:03,060
story well whoop-de-doo whoop-de-doo okay

781
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,940
Dang, hold on.

782
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:14,080
There.

783
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:14,540
Oh!

784
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,580
Beep, beep, beep.

785
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:27,420
I can't even... I can't even saw the rest of the puzzle
because it's...

786
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,280
It's all black.

787
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:30,360
It's too dark.

788
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,160
Okay, a little spooky.

789
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,340
I don't like it.

790
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,960
It's a little scary.

791
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:43,440
I wouldn't trust it!

792
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,660
Oh god.

793
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:46,240
Okay.

794
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:54,480
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,
do, do, do, do, do, oh, loading.

795
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,700
Descending deeper into the building, Stanley realized he
felt a bit peculiar.

796
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:06,380
It was a stirring of emotion in his chest, as though he felt
more free to think for himself, to question the nature of

797
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:06,980
his job.

798
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:07,520
No, no, no.

799
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:11,720
Why did he feel this now, when for years it had never
occurred to him?

800
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,220
This question would not go unanswered for long.

801
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:16,680
Whoa!

802
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:21,280
No, I like being a pawn, a little cog in the machine.

803
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,240
I like not thinking.

804
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,620
I like, you know, just...

805
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:30,180
Stanley walks straight ahead through the large door that
read Mind Control Facility.

806
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,640
Mind Control Facility.

807
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:33,380
Back up.

808
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,180
Go back up?

809
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:36,960
Oh, we can.

810
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:37,420
You're right.

811
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:41,640
I don't think so.

812
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:42,300
I don't think I did.

813
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,320
Never mind.

814
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,960
Stanley actually got back into the elevator.

815
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:53,880
and went back up silly me yeah silly you why did stanley do
that when he knew that it would just lead back to his boss's

816
01:04:53,880 --> 01:05:02,880
office well that's a great question i just can't wait to
find out the end is never the end there's never the end

817
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:03,880

818
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:16,540
i'm excited to find out too something must have changed

819
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:23,100

it was before you got onto the elevator it's still just

820
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:30,140
exactly what it is what a decision you've made to come up
here and look at the office again this has fleshed out the

821
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:37,400
plot of the story in new and fascinating ways I could have
never anticipated it's that keen eye for storytelling that

822
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:45,400
you have an incisive rapid fire of critical plot points One
after the other, weaving a rich tapestry of uncompromising

823
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,000
narrative.

824
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:46,420
Wow.

825
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,420
I'm bolted to the edge of my seat.

826
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:51,360
Are you done, mister?

827
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:52,440
Are you done?

828
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,580
Are you done being a little, a little pissy baby?

829
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,440
Certificate of...

Shanti.

835
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:20,280
Vintage.

836
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:25,320
Okay.

846
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:20,510
give me the option to not do anything else.

847
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:27,730
Did you think we were going to go forward down the spooky
corridor?

848
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:32,510
It's time once again to go back up in the elevator.

849
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:34,170
I'm not stupid.

850
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:35,410
I'm seeing horror movies.

851
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:37,630
Is it the boss's office again?

852
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:38,470
Or what?

853
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:42,270
If it's the boss's office this time, the suspense is killing
me.

854
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:44,010
The boss's office!

855
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:45,650
Boss's office!

856
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:46,870
Meep!

857
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:50,570
Thank you.

858
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:54,310
Boss's office, boss is...

859
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:55,310
Yes!

860
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:57,230
The boss's office!

861
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:00,610
Oh my god.

862
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:02,570
It's the boss's office.

863
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:06,530
This absolutely changes everything for me.

864
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:09,840
Give me a timeout here for a minute while I process this.

865
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:10,650
Oh!

866
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:24,050
Doesn't make me sleepy.

867
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:25,390
Okay, I'm ready.

868
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:28,250
I'm prepared to embrace this stunning revelation.

869
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:38,870
and to move forward with no no wait no wait no i need more
time to process oh please hold everybody please hold please

870
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:49,050
hold gonna make this into like my be right back screen i
remember wanting one of those drinking birds when i was a

871
01:08:49,050 --> 01:09:01,870
kid everybody hold on just pretend i'm going to the bathroom
i have terms with it i have made space in my world for this

872
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:13,470
astonishing new reality as before i turn to your expert eye
for gripping narrative master stanley wait but i'm the maid

873
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:14,510
you're the master

874
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:21,790
i'm just a maid i don't have to do i don't deserve the title
of master

875
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:36,750
master stanley it's got a nice ring to it though of course
going back down the elevator i mean sure now it's obvious

876
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:43,590
but you have to understand that 30 seconds ago this kind of
thing had never been attempted before i had no frame of

877
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:49,610
reference to even anticipate it that's just how revelatory
Stanley's decision-making is.

878
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:50,050
Yeah.

879
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:55,990
It's the fresh air in a landscape of storytelling that has
grown stale and repetitive.

880
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:59,710
Loading, loading, loading.

881
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:04,410
It's not gonna get me this time.

882
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:09,250
It didn't even talk.

883
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:12,610
I can see the mind control and oh, there it is.

884
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:14,230
It's like a little...

885
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:16,370
They should have done a better job at hiding it.

886
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:21,390
I feel like, you know, should we go up one more time?

887
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:26,710
I mean, it's like right there.

888
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:32,030
Stanley walks straight ahead through the large door that
read mind control facility.

889
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:37,130
You know what, every time he tells me what to do, I don't
want to do it.

890
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:40,830
Every time he's just like, Stanley does this, I'm like, no,
I don't.

891
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:42,610
I have free will.

892
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:46,030
I, I'm Stanley.

893
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:55,050
hmm you know what what i've just thought of something okay
hold on let's stop for a moment oh oh don't you realize it's

894
01:10:55,050 --> 01:11:03,870
the anticipation stanley watching me while sewing up my
off-kind cosplay see you there but the suspense the agony of

895
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:10,750
waiting and anticipating oh my god the thrill that's the
real thrill oh i simply don't want to let that feeling go

896
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:22,270
it's so precious so fleeting so fleeting why don't we take
this elevator ride nice and slow oh my god there we go isn't

897
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:29,630
this so much more exciting you know stanley it seems like
nowadays the only thing that audiences want is to be shocked

898
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:36,330
as loudly and frequently as possible please don't do that
they want big explosive flung right in their faces from the

899
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:43,550
very moment that things get started please but where's the
tension where's the trust in the audience to build a slow

900
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:47,070
and nuanced appreciation for the story Thanks.

901
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:47,730
Thanks.

902
01:11:47,730 --> 01:11:50,490
Why aren't we given time to imagine the surprises?

903
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:55,830
Do you have to think and to anticipate and then to marvel at
the eventual reveal?

904
01:11:56,590 --> 01:11:58,730
This is storytelling, Stanley.

905
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:01,130
What you and I are doing right now.

906
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:05,370
This is the most exciting narrative to be developed in
years.

907
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:07,270
And it's really all because of you.

908
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:12,950
You're the one who took this bold step of revisiting the
exact same locations over and over.

909
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:14,170
Truly, I mean it.

910
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:15,190
It's innovative, I know.

911
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:18,350
It's not like anything else out there.

912
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:21,510
You see, I want stories that surprise me, Stanley.

913
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:23,130
I want to have to think.

914
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:26,230
I want to be engaged and not pandered to.

915
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:28,470
We're being fed such unimaginative.

916
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:29,410
He wants to marry.

917
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:36,850
All the time and we all know it, which is why we're so
starved for content that makes us feel sharp and vital and

918
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:37,590
alive.

919
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:39,710
That's why people like you so much, Stanley.

920
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:41,950
You regretted the Canadian truck's placement of...

921
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:42,510
Thank you!

922
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:43,310
Thanks, Trix!

923
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:45,490
You're a role model, you know?

924
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:48,310
That role model!

925
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:53,310
Oh, I didn't know when to spring this on you, but well, I've
gathered a little press conference for you.

926
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:57,070
So that you can talk about your work and your storytelling
in your life.

927
01:12:57,710 --> 01:13:02,750
Yes, I know you're not much for the public eye, but I
thought it would especially mean a lot to the people who

928
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:04,510
have been following you from the beginning.

929
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:06,610
They really look up to you, Stanley.

930
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:09,890
I don't know if you realize the impact you have on them.

931
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:15,530
This is the kind of gesture that might leave a tremendous
impact on them for the better.

932
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:17,490
Whoa!

933
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:23,690
Boss is office!

934
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:28,730
The room where we're holding the press conference should be
just around the corner here somewhere.

935
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:32,270
Live on stage.

936
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:35,950
All eyes on Stanley.

937
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:40,850
World's healthiest human being.

938
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:42,210
All tricks reveal.

939
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:43,930
Doctors hate her.

940
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:46,490
We did it.

941
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:47,670
The Pyramids.

942
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:50,030
The guy who went to Mars.

943
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:51,710
Who is that over there?

944
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:53,210
Look at this, though.

945
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:53,730
Oh, here.

946
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:56,130
I thought...

947
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:57,010
Fuck.

948
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:01,030
I thought for a second that was Jack's films.

949
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:07,290
Stanley reveals all in his new book.

950
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:09,630
I'm a published author even.

951
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:11,110
Okay.

952
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,480
World Peace, baby!

953
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:19,040
Ah, yes.

954
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:19,800
Here it is.

955
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:21,740
just through this door.

956
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,260
The Stanley Parable Stanley.

957
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,700
Tonight, live on stage.

958
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,040
What was I saying over there?

959
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,480
The man, the process, the myth, the legend, the parable.

960
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:33,680
Stanley.

961
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:40,030
World's first sentient machine.

962
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:41,850
Wow.

963
01:14:43,370 --> 01:14:52,090
Have you guys heard how, like, these tech places that are,
like, that are, like, having, creating robots for, First of

964
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:53,470
all, I have an issue.

965
01:14:53,970 --> 01:14:56,270
Why do the robots they create have to look so human?

966
01:14:56,710 --> 01:14:59,210
Why can't they, like, look like cool robots, you know?

967
01:14:59,610 --> 01:15:01,750
Why can't they look like Drossel from Fireball?

968
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:09,070
Why can't we get just hot, I mean, cute, like, why can't we
just get robots instead of, like, uncanny valley humans?

969
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:09,890
You know what I'm saying?

970
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:14,170
But also, why are they all so flirty?

971
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:21,650
Why is it all, like, the built female robots are just like,
oh, hey.

972
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:30,150
you are just it is just a wonderful time meeting you tonight
and I just they just say some really unhinged things that

973
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:38,870
make me think like if they are they actually trying to you
know get with a human and then have human robot babies I

974
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:43,150
just don't know because

01:16:54,500 --> 01:17:03,500
that is it it is like a little it's it's like a figure box
almost and it's 6 000 yen um it's basically just like a

983

glorified alexa but with an anime girl in it and they also

I'm going to experiment a little bit with it.

988
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:52,860
I'm going to experiment a little.

989
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,520
Has an anime girl in it.

990
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:56,640
Are you sure it isn't a gay box for you?

991
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:59,740
It's the gay to box.

992
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:03,540
Yeah.

993
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:11,370
Something unrelated, but do you have Dave the Diver?

994
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:12,450
I do, none.

995
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:14,450
I actually got the...

996
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:18,370
The Godzilla.

997
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:20,950
I got the Godzilla DLC.

998
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:28,030

always wanted one but we're just like me and been like this

999
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:39,920

tried it yet but I'm sure it'll be awesome mm-hmm anyway are

1000
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:45,780
you ready no I told them you're going to speak a little bit
about the nature of surprise in storytelling and what it

1001
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:53,480
means to craft a truly unpredictable narrative don't worry
do great just be yourself and from the heart.

1002
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:53,740
The heart.

1003
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:54,180
The heart.

1004
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:56,240
I'm really proud of you, Stanley.

1005
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,620
Okay, it looks like they're ready for you.

1006
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:00,800
Go get them.

1007
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:01,740
Go get them.

Almonds, chair, gum, table, nut bar.

1009
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:08,120
Oh god, hold on.

1010
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:12,120
The dude who came up with pizza, I can't compete with him.

1011
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,060
I can't do it.

1012
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:18,640
Oh god, I'm just gonna eat these real quick.

1013
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:24,740
Oh, I can't do this.

1014
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,520
I can't do this.

1015
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:27,360
Oh, my, is that my green room?

1016
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:28,600
427.

1017
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:29,360
That's me.

1018
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:31,700
Look, I'm amongst the greats.

1019
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,980
I can't, I don't, I don't deserve to be here.

1020
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:36,840
Okay.

1021
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:39,480
Okay, hold on.

1022
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,960
Let's look over what I said, what, my notes, my notes.

1023
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:45,700
Stanley, me, dad, age six, story.

1024
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:52,660
Son is, son is wanting me to do a good job.

1025
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,100
Break a leg, champ.

1026
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,040
Your boss.

1027
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:56,960
Thanks, boss.

1028
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:02,500
Stanley, my true love for you grows every day you make me
feel alive.

1029
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,960
Your wife from the experiment department?

1030
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,100
Wait, oh, from the...

1031
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,020
From the...

1032
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:11,060
From the...

1033
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:12,860
Experiment ending?

1034
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,540
We have a wife!

1035
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,080
I love the way you ride elevators.

1036
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,300
X, X.

1037
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,160
We're cheating on our wife!

1038
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:22,600

1041
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:46,080

reminds me you know when like someone tweets something and

1042
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,560
then everybody replies to that to kind of hype them up.

1043
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:55,560
It's just like, thanks for letting me borrow your Mercedes
and saving me from the burning building.

1044
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:00,360
Thanks for showing me that cool skateboard trick in the
parking lot.

1045
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:02,960
It's the same vibes I'm getting.

1046
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,400
The freedom ending.

1047
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:07,200
Adventure.

Oh, wait.

1049
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:12,580
I went to the mind control facility and all I got was this
lousy sticker.

1050
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:18,130
Congratulations, Stanley.

1051
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:19,670
Remember where you came from.

1052
01:21:19,690 --> 01:21:20,910
your coworkers.

1053
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:25,250
Oh, we got a little golf thing and everything.

1054
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:29,230
I can hear the people.

1055
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:30,110
They're waiting for me.

1056
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:39,830
You can do this.

1057
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:41,870
You can do this.

1058
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:42,770
You can do this.

1059
01:21:44,110 --> 01:21:44,870
You can do this.

1060
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,000
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

1061
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:53,080
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

1062
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:54,860
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

1063
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,740
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

1064
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:58,560
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

1065
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:04,300
Peter Piper, Piper, Piper Piper Piper Piper Piper Piper

1067
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:10,230
You?

1068
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:11,390
You?

1069
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:12,030
You?

1070
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:12,750
Oh,

I love you too!

1073
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:23,940
Oh wait, I didn't even get to the end!

1074
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:36,780
Is it Wrestle- Wrestle- Wait, Wrestle-Wa-Wrestletuber 2025
already?

1075
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,080
Just like a Wrestle-Tuber.

1076
01:22:44,170 --> 01:22:45,830
This fucked me for a long time, but...

1077
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:54,110
but how were they already already wet oh sorry hold on I
couldn't see it already pickled when he picked them doesn't

1078
01:22:54,110 --> 01:23:08,240
add up so true um was it all just a dream all of his
co-workers were gone what could it mean stanley decided to

1079
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:17,160
go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed a memo
every time i like i say every time

1080
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:26,230
I was going to say every time I play this game, which I have
not, I don't want to make it seem like I've played it a lot,

1081
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:31,530
but I always, I guess maybe every loop I expect to see a
person, you know what I mean?

1082
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,260
It's new.

1083
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:45,860
It's new.

1084
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,340
Like exit 8?

1085
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:49,720
Yes, yes, yes.

1086
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:56,830
Maybe you just haven't found the right path yet.

1087
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:00,410
Oh.

1088
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,230
New content?

1089
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:05,110
What does that mean, new content?

1090
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:05,990
I don't know.

1091
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:07,950
You tell me.

1092
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,440
Another elevator, my favorite.

1093
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:17,140
Oh.

1094
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:19,680
Okay.

1095
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,340
It's like a ride.

1096
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:29,360
It's like a theme park ride.

1097
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:29,820
Hello.

1098
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:33,640
And thank you for playing the Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe.

1099
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:40,420
As you may know, the Stanley Parable was a video game
released in 2013 on home computers.

1100
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:50,120
After receiving critical and commercial success, it was
expanded upon in 2022 with the Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe,

1101
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:53,660
a reimagining of the game for consoles and home computers.

1102
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:55,540
Home computers, that's me, that's where I'm at.

Me too!

1110
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,140
Though I'm pretty sure I did this before.

1111
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,740
Okay, so far it's an elephant.

1112
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:29,300
But that's okay.

1113
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:30,620
I don't remember.

1114
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:32,700
I really don't remember you so bad.

1115
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,600
But I'm sure it's just the beginning of a mesmerizing
adventure.

1116
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:35,600
Cat Potato!

1117
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:36,360

ready let's do it yeah oh my gosh I'm so excited because

1121
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:07,060
there's so much content it's true this game is really crazy
initial impressions of stanley parable ultra deluxe mostly

1122
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:15,220
tedious it's as if them oh okay let's see the content give
me the content stanley oh my gosh i'm a content creator i

1123
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:24,940
can give that to you uh now thinking about it thinking about
like some of the endings that i remember there's one in

1124
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:34,320
particular that i remember that was like um oh you like sit
in a room and like thousands of years go by and stuff like

1125
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:34,400
that.

1126
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:35,620
That's the only one I remember.

1127
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:38,260
Wait, is this the room?

1128
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:39,120
Uh-oh.

1129
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:40,060
Wait.

1130
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:42,240
Uh.

1131
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:44,060
No.

1132
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:44,380
All right.

1133
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:45,620
All right.

1134
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:46,100
Let's see.

1135
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,440
It's the jump circle.

1136
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:53,880
Oh, I got...

1137
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:02,080
Wait, no.

1138
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:03,700
I think I jumped enough.

1139
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:05,120
Is...

1140
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:05,820
Is that it?

1141
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:06,500
No.

1142
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,620
Surely that's not all the new content.

1143
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:10,460
There has to be something else, right?

1144
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,060
Oh, there's all...

1145
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:12,460
Okay, hold on, I'm gonna finish it.

1146
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:13,500
I'm gonna finish it.

1147
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:15,340
Jumping.

1148
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:16,460
Jumping.

1149
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:27,200
Save the jumps?

1150
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:27,880
Oh.

1151
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:30,800
Okay.

1152
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,840
Another elevator.

1153
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:46,400
Stanley, I have to say, initial impressions of this game are
not possible.

1154
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,400
My streamer is so wasteful.

1155
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,460
It's just elevators and jumping.

1156
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,520
Is this what passes for exciting new content?

1157
01:27:53,100 --> 01:28:04,900
you guys are excited but also try not to like backseat too
much i do want to experience things on my own as well so if

1158
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:14,720
i screw up that's up to me you know what i mean oh wait
there's more very good i knew there had to be something else

1159
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:19,080
let's see it i'm ready for whatever it is the abyss the
abyss

1160
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:25,020
Thank you for enjoying the new content.

1161
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:25,960
That's it?

1162
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:28,060
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

1163
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:28,880
You see, Stanley?

1164
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:36,280
This is what happens when greedy video game developers with
no respect for their fan base rush a cheap expansion to

1165
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:39,400
market for no reason other than to make an easy dollar.

1166
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:40,300
Classic Abyss Room.

1167
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:42,800
And don't get misplanted on the level of craftsmanship
that's gone into it.

1168
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:43,880
My office had three.

1169
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:49,200
I'm looking right now at the game's achievements, and it's
hard to believe one of them actually says, Test Achievement,

1170
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:50,520
please ignore.

1171
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:53,080
What quality assurance department signed off on this?

1172
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,040
I've gotten a single achievement, actually.

1173
01:28:55,100 --> 01:29:00,000
I'm offended, and I intend to find these people on Twitter,
and hold them personally accountable.

1174
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:01,520
Uh, formally Twitter.

1175
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:02,520
X.

1176
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:05,880
I built up too much anticipation around the new content, I'm
afraid.

1177
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,420
It could never have lived up to such expectations.

1178
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:09,180
Speak the truth.

1179
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:12,220
If you're still with me, why don't we just reset the game?

1180
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:12,500
No!

1181
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:16,260
And we'll try to get back to what the Stanley Parable is
really about.

1182
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:17,680
No frills.

1183
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:18,940
No gimmicks.

1184
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:19,720
No gimmicks.

1185
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:22,920
Just you and me having a great time together, like always.

1186
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:25,300
What do you say, friend?

1187
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:27,400
Oh.

1188
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:30,820
Oh.

1189
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,380
It's a little different.

1190
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:36,900
That's my office.

1191
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:40,480
That's where I'm supposed to be in this very moment.

1192
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:45,200
Fascinating.

1193
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:46,220
Oh, pst.

1194
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:49,260
Stanley, come over here.

1195
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:50,800
In the vent.

1196
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:52,880
I want to show you something.

1197
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:53,760
Ew!

1198
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:55,340
Ew!

1199
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:56,180
Ew!

1200
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:56,760
Ew!

1201
01:29:59,160 --> 01:29:59,600
Ew!

1202
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:00,140
Ew!

1203
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:00,380
Ew!

1204
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:00,560
Ew!

1205
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:01,900
It's like, it's like it.

1206
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:05,720
It's so sus.

1207
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:08,400
What if I don't list them?

1208
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:11,460
Let's see, let's try this.

1209
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:14,860
Oh, you don't want to see the cool surprise I made for you?

1210
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:15,480
Well, fine.

1211
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:15,940
Oh, surprise.

1212
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:17,760
You're a dork anyway, so who cares?

1213
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:20,520
Excuse- Oh, what?

1214
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,960
Are you saying that I'm not, like, cool enough to go
through?

1215
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:23,780
Never mind.

1216
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,040
You're not a dog.

1217
01:30:35,290 --> 01:30:36,750
I think I have to go.

1218
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:46,210
When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the
door on his left.

1219
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:51,270
I'm not listening to you at all.

1220
01:30:52,450 --> 01:30:53,630
I'm not listening to you do anything.

1221
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:57,430
Perhaps he wanted to stop by the employee lounge first, just
to admire it.

1222
01:30:57,670 --> 01:30:58,030
No.

1223
01:30:58,630 --> 01:31:00,030
I'm just gonna keep going.

1224
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:01,670
Screw you.

1225
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:02,470
Call him in.

1226
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:03,530
Yep.

1227
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:05,630
La la la la.

1228
01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:06,610
Nope.

1229
01:31:07,150 --> 01:31:10,590
No, I'm not listening to anything you say any longer.

1230
01:31:10,690 --> 01:31:14,770
Stanley was so bad at following directions, it's incredible
he wasn't fired years ago.

1231
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:15,390
Do not lie.

1232
01:31:15,730 --> 01:31:17,810
If you are lying right now, stop.

1233
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:18,970
Okay.

1234
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:23,850
What if I told you my real name wasn't really meant phantom?

1235
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:32,130
What if I told you that I named myself that once I, when I
came back from consciousness after dying, because I had a

1236
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:32,630
spear mint.

1237
01:31:33,130 --> 01:31:42,190
in my tummy do not jump from cargo lift while it is in
motion will cause death penalty for misuse of cargo lift

1238
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:49,270
1000 penalty for jumping off the cargo lift 5000 look
Stanley I think perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot

1239
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:56,490
here I'm not your enemy really I'm not there's the exit
investing your trust in someone else can be difficult but

1240
01:31:56,490 --> 01:32:04,490
the exit's right there story has been about nothing but you
all this time there's someone you've been neglecting Stanley

1241
01:32:04,490 --> 01:32:12,770
someone you've forgotten really I was in the middle of
something do you have zero consideration are you that

1242
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:19,710
convinced that I want something bad to happen to you why I
don't know how to convince you of this but I really do want

1243
01:32:19,710 --> 01:32:27,870
to help you to show you something beautiful look let me
prove it let me prove that I'm on your side give me a chance

1244
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:34,370
I'm no dorker give me a in a relationship.

1245
01:32:35,110 --> 01:32:35,470
Narrator.

1246
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:39,010
Ghosts, no followers.

1247
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:39,730
Yeah.

1248
01:32:40,370 --> 01:32:42,150
No buckets past this point.

1249
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:45,710
Now listen carefully.

1250
01:32:45,950 --> 01:32:46,650
This is important.

1251
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:49,430
Stanley walked through the red door.

1252
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:58,220
This one has a swipe a key card.

1253
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:05,330
Hmm.

1254
01:33:07,370 --> 01:33:08,190
Um.

1255
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:19,210
Aha.

1256
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:31,370
Perhaps you misunderstood Stanley walked through the red
door He just picked me up like I was a goddamn sim I'm

1257
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:39,670
colorblind I'm colorblind I still don't think we're
communicating properly Stanley walked through the red door

1258
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:49,850
Red door Alright fine go ahead Stanley You want to know so
badly what's out there You want to find out what lies at the

1259
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:57,730
end of this road you've chosen world don't let me stop you
oh i do oh wait is is this the place that i got spoiled

1260
01:33:57,730 --> 01:34:04,070
before you see there's nothing here oh i haven't even
finished building this section of the map because you were

1261
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:09,790
never supposed to be here in the first place broken rooms
exposed developer textures oh that's true what you had

1262
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:16,830
wanted was it worth ruining the entire story i had written
out specifically for you do you not think i put a lot of

1263
01:34:16,830 --> 01:34:24,410
time into that because i did and in the to the baby this is
what you wanted to see baby baby help me here stanley help

1264
01:34:24,410 --> 01:34:31,010
elucidate these strange and unknowable desires of yours what
would have made this game better a baby what did you want to

1265
01:34:31,010 --> 01:34:39,630
see anime skill tree skill tree work with me you give me
absolutely nothing so far tell you what let me take a stab

1266
01:34:39,630 --> 01:34:47,010
in the dark at a new design and you can give me some
feedback there we go a third option this already feels leaps

1267
01:34:47,010 --> 01:34:59,610
ahead of where we were before go ahead stanley take it for a
spin okay oh okay i'm going to stop you there now tell me

1268
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:06,250
about your experience with this new version would you say
that the game benefited from allowing you more choices feel

1269
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:14,990
free to be honest i'm looking for some real critical
feedback here five is the best or one is the best you gotta

1270
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:27,950
tell me which is the best five or one oh dis um disagree
highly disagree highly agree hmm a one i mean i can

1271
01:35:27,950 --> 01:35:33,710
understand if you had reservations you saw ways the game
could be improved to more fully express itself mechanically

1272
01:35:33,710 --> 01:35:40,990
and artistically but a one a one that's not even helpful
what am i supposed to do with that but i guess it isn't my

1273
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:47,610
place to judge Here, based on the data from your previous
playthrough, I've compiled a new version.

1274
01:35:47,970 --> 01:35:48,210
Okay.

1275
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:51,890
If it's perfectly candid, I think I've knocked it out of the
park with this one.

1276
01:35:52,270 --> 01:35:53,070
Let's take a look.

1277
01:35:54,370 --> 01:35:54,670
Oh.

1278
01:35:55,350 --> 01:36:01,690
Now, would you say that competitive leaderboard helped you
feel motivated to keep walking through doors?

1279
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:04,050
Again, honest answers, please.

1280
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:06,170
Wait, are these real people?

1281
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:09,470
No.

1282
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:10,410
Oh, no.

1283
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:15,830
21.3% of players skipped at the intro sequence.

1284
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:18,110
That's a dead rat!

1285
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,140
Go a dead rat!

1286
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,720
How long does it take you to get to the correct door?

1287
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,720
In total, there's so many steps taken.

1288
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:40,780
I'm 9,928th out of 900,320...

1289
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:41,220
No!

1290
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,280
Saying that I'm...

1291
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:48,300
That I suck, okay?

1292
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:50,020
Okay.

1293
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:51,960
Aw, man.

1294
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:52,560
Oh!

1295
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:54,020
Uh-oh.

1296
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:56,880
Uh-oh.

1297
01:36:59,300 --> 01:36:59,980
Uh-oh.

1298
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:00,980
Uh-oh.

1299
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:02,760
Uh-oh.

1300
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,360
Uh-oh.

1301
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,000
Uh-oh.

1302
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,520
Happy Memorial Day, Mint.

1303
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:09,540
Eat anything.

1304
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:11,300
Eat anything.

1305
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:11,520
What?

1306
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,520
Go today at barbecue ribs for dinner.

1307
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:13,980
Yummy!

1308
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:18,500
I fucked the game.

1309
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:25,810
You can't.

1310
01:37:25,870 --> 01:37:27,410
No, seriously, we disabled you.

1311
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:28,550
Get your first achievement.

1312
01:37:29,250 --> 01:37:30,810
I didn't try jumping.

1313
01:37:32,830 --> 01:37:34,370
I tried moving.

1314
01:37:35,230 --> 01:37:35,830
Uh-oh.

1315
01:37:36,510 --> 01:37:38,610
I think I have to restart.

1316
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:45,380
I think I have to restart.

1317
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:48,380
Oh, no.

1318
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:53,960
I actually broke the game.

1319
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:01,840
Okay, a dead rat wouldn't have gotten stuck.

1320
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:05,220
That's why he's 9,327th.

1321
01:38:05,860 --> 01:38:06,700
I'm a dead rat.

1322
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:09,700
Oh, she a dead rat would never soft-log their game.

1323
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:11,080
No!

1324
01:38:13,780 --> 01:38:14,560
Rip Bozo.

1325
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:15,980
Congrats, you got the closet.

1326
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:20,260
Oh, here we go.

1327
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:26,040
We could go through here if we wanted.

1328
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:27,080
Psst!

1329
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:30,160
Stanley, come over here.

1330
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:38,020
in the vent i want to show you something what should we do
guys should we go through the vent should we are you still a

1331
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:44,620
dork no i don't think so

1332
01:38:49,250 --> 01:39:05,330
the narrator is the dork obviously coffee night wow this is
pretty cinematic here i go Okay, nice.

1333
01:39:08,570 --> 01:39:13,450
Okay, you remember how cheap and unsatisfying the new
ultra-deluxe content turned out to be?

1334
01:39:13,670 --> 01:39:15,390
Well, it got me thinking about the past.

1335
01:39:15,670 --> 01:39:18,350
And how much better the Stanley Parable used to be.

1336
01:39:18,430 --> 01:39:18,870
Oh.

1337
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:23,890
So I made something special and tucked it away here where
the game's developers won't find it.

1338
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:24,610
Elden Ring!

1339
01:39:24,990 --> 01:39:26,270
Just our little secret.

1340
01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:27,710
Elden Ring!

1341
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:31,390
Okay.

1342
01:39:31,650 --> 01:39:33,030
Just kidding.

1343
01:39:34,530 --> 01:39:36,870
I call it the memory zone.

1344
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:37,310
Wow.

1345
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:45,010
It's where I've been storing all my favorite memories so I
can relive the peak experiences of my life whenever I want.

1346
01:39:45,130 --> 01:39:46,050
Guy lives in the past.

1347
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:49,490
Experiences like the launch of the Stanley Parable on PC.

1348
01:39:52,630 --> 01:39:52,690
Wow.

1349
01:39:53,890 --> 01:40:00,170
You see, Stanley, doesn't the memory zone remind you of how
wonderful Stanley Parable was before it was solid with a

1350
01:40:00,170 --> 01:40:01,250
cheap re-release?

1351
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:08,170
Remember back in October of 2013, when the game originally
launched, The British Academy of Film and Television Arts!

1352
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:11,690
Back then, it all meant something.

1353
01:40:12,570 --> 01:40:13,430
Oh, the waste.

1354
01:40:14,410 --> 01:40:16,150
Memory, sweet memory.

1355
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:19,010
Oh my god, Steam Page!

1356
01:40:20,870 --> 01:40:22,410
That's so funny!

1357
01:40:23,230 --> 01:40:26,730
Ah, 2013, when the Stanley Parable was released.

1358
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:30,530
Life was so much more simple back in 2013.

1359
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:34,430
Especially because the Stanley Parable was just released.

1360
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:38,970
Oh, I was going to say this is the actual time, but it is
not.

1361
01:40:39,490 --> 01:40:45,330
Our first kiss, my first car, the release of the Stanley
Parable in 2013.

1362
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:50,250
Oh, scripts.

1363
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:54,850
Stanley Parable on Steam.

1364
01:40:58,190 --> 01:40:59,190
Oh, no, just kidding.

1365
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:00,590
On the website.

1366
01:41:01,650 --> 01:41:03,790
The original remake.

1367
01:41:04,670 --> 01:41:05,030
Wow.

1368
01:41:07,890 --> 01:41:09,270
Good times.

1369
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:10,810
Oh, I've seen...

1370
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:13,270
Oh, the mind control facility.

1371
01:41:13,770 --> 01:41:15,650
Oh, the two doors.

1372
01:41:16,410 --> 01:41:17,330
Oh my gosh.

1373
01:41:17,470 --> 01:41:19,030
This has been so long.

1374
01:41:19,130 --> 01:41:20,410
Why is this roped off?

1375
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:22,430
Am I in a bad spot?

1376
01:41:26,090 --> 01:41:28,270
Smile because it happened.

1377
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:32,810
Their first dollar!

1378
01:41:33,690 --> 01:41:35,650
Or just a dollar, who knows?

1379
01:41:36,650 --> 01:41:38,610
The demo, wow.

1380
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:42,110
2013, that means they announced Half-Life 3?

1381
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:43,850
No, they didn't.

1382
01:41:51,310 --> 01:41:54,130
Go outside, don't play for five years?

1383
01:41:57,190 --> 01:41:59,710
Stanley Parable Alpha Test?

1384
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:00,770
Mm-hmm.

1385
01:42:02,850 --> 01:42:03,150
Mm-hmm.

1386
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:18,890
more British stuff British British glad they've been
nominated a lot Stanley parable deals tough choices oh he's

1387
01:42:18,890 --> 01:42:21,810
dead wait there's another person is that her wife

1388
01:42:28,490 --> 01:42:32,050
the flowers are so hard

1389
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:47,150
little Stanley oh little Stanley

1390
01:42:52,170 --> 01:43:08,670
it's Adele never mind I'll find Someone like you I would And
over here is where I keep reviews of the Stanley Parable

1391
01:43:08,670 --> 01:43:17,490
Like this stunning triumph of games journalism 10 out of 10
from destructoid.com James Stephanie Sterling writes And I

1392
01:43:17,490 --> 01:43:26,310
quote We're so many games that aspire to be more than games
End up less than any form of art Stanley Parable strives And

1393
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:30,950
then succeeds to be every game ever created Did you hear
that, Stanley?

1394
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:33,210
Every game ever created.

1395
01:43:33,570 --> 01:43:37,990
That's how grand and all-encompassing the original Stanley
Parable was.

1396
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:41,350
It was literally every game ever created.

1397
01:43:41,770 --> 01:43:42,510
It was Skyrim.

1398
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:43,730
It was Persona 3.

1399
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:44,530
Persona 3!

1400
01:43:45,370 --> 01:43:47,150
That's so relevant now.

1401
01:43:47,610 --> 01:43:48,630
It's no games at all.

1402
01:43:49,330 --> 01:43:51,110
It isn't even the Stanley Parable anymore.

1403
01:43:51,390 --> 01:43:52,130
It's so relevant now.

1404
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:53,770
It's just a husk now.

1405
01:43:54,350 --> 01:43:58,850
A lifeless husk with an hour of new elevator content.

1406
01:44:00,850 --> 01:44:03,470
A husk, a shell of itself.

1407
01:44:04,450 --> 01:44:05,230
So sad.

1408
01:44:07,030 --> 01:44:08,590
Wow, there's a lot going on.

1409
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:12,470
Maintenance, can't go on there.

1410
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:15,790
Knowing your city.

1411
01:44:16,330 --> 01:44:16,890
Mm-hmm.

1412
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:24,990
Old pictures and stuff, you know, the original remake.

1413
01:44:25,710 --> 01:44:27,030
Person of the Year, that's me!

1414
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:29,030
Who is this?

1415
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:29,670
Is that my wife?

1416
01:44:29,690 --> 01:44:30,010
Life.

1417
01:44:32,150 --> 01:44:33,290
Who is that?

1418
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:36,610
PetScop.

1419
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:45,250
Collectors Edition.

1420
01:44:45,450 --> 01:44:45,710
What comes?

1421
01:44:45,850 --> 01:44:47,030
Isn't that a tie?

1422
01:44:47,170 --> 01:44:47,690
It's so cute.

1423
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:53,180
The greatest wealth is memory.

1424
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,880
The red in the blue door!

1425
01:45:00,180 --> 01:45:01,760
We just saw the happy button.

1426
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:03,140
I don't think we've heard that yet.

1427
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:05,540
Here's another moving passage.

1428
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:07,820
This time from GameSpot.com.

1429
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:08,600
GameSpot.

1430
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:15,500
Stanley Parable is both a richly stimulating commentary on
the nature of choice in games and one that offers some of

1431
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:20,980
the most enjoyable, surprising, and rewarding choices I've
ever been confronted with in a game.

1432
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:22,140
Nine out of ten.

1433
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:23,280
Don't you get it, Stanley?

1434
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:24,780
The game was perfect.

1435
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,740
And will the hero love the original Stanley Parable?

1436
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:28,920
It didn't need new content.

1437
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:31,700
It just needed to be left alone.

1438
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:32,220
Left alone.

1439
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:38,260
To spend the rest of time collecting dust in the hallowed
hall of beloved video game memories.

1440
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:38,860
No.

1441
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:42,120
Yeah, I didn't need anything else.

1442
01:45:42,540 --> 01:45:46,700
Oh my gosh, the Himmel the Hero joke made me think, like,
literally, I think it was like yesterday.

1443
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:53,660
I was thinking, I was like, man, I guess, you know,
eventually Himmel the Hero jokes will, like, get old.

1444
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:58,980
But then we can just make the new joke, Himmel the Hero,
loved Himmel the Hero jokes.

1445
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:02,100
So it will never get old.

1446
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,640
What's this?

1447
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:04,940
What is this, the collector?

1448
01:46:05,020 --> 01:46:07,240
Oh no, this is the carpet textures.

1449
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,140
game project.

1450
01:46:19,070 --> 01:46:21,130
The serious room.

1451
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:27,290
What is what is Kiara's room called again?

1452
01:46:29,650 --> 01:46:31,310
What is that one called again?

1453
01:46:31,690 --> 01:46:35,430
The the the usual room?

1454
01:46:35,610 --> 01:46:36,210
The usual room?

1455
01:46:36,370 --> 01:46:36,670
Yeah yeah.

1456
01:46:39,150 --> 01:46:40,990
It's the usual room.

1457
01:46:41,110 --> 01:46:52,690
can i go through here well where am i supposed to go i went
through here didn't i oh these were simpler times stanley oh

1458
01:46:52,690 --> 01:47:00,950
down here but i wouldn't give to go back to have it all over
again i know wait hang on yeah i don't recall this part of

1459
01:47:00,950 --> 01:47:11,230
the memory zone before what's this what's down here oh oh
whoa oh god no stanley it's a collection of reviews from

1460
01:47:11,230 --> 01:47:17,870
steam the online video game distributor i haven't looked at
these i think i vaguely remember this part imagine what's

1461
01:47:17,870 --> 01:47:25,810
been collecting down here oh god surely these reviews were
glowing as well oh yeah oh yeah baby steam reviews are oh

1462
01:47:25,810 --> 01:47:35,410
boy honestly i could not be bothered to play this game to
full completion oh no the river is obnoxious and unfunny for

1463
01:47:35,410 --> 01:47:36,790
his humor and dialogue

1464
01:47:40,950 --> 01:47:47,030
funny i'm not trying to be funny i'm trying to make a
serious work of art i suppose i could write up a handful of

1465
01:47:47,030 --> 01:47:53,730
gags to insert into the stanley parable but the game is
already such a densely layered web of profound philosophical

1466
01:47:53,730 --> 01:48:01,450
insights that i can't even imagine where i'd have the room
to stick this one's a positive one don't let one bad review

1467
01:48:01,450 --> 01:48:11,470
get you down don't don't worry about it you know it's so
funny this comment didn't inspire me to play this today but

1468
01:48:11,470 --> 01:48:22,790
I saw a comment earlier that someone left for me I was just
like quit your job you quit your job for this go back to

1469
01:48:22,790 --> 01:48:35,890
being an oh I was like you know what I was already gonna
play the Stanley parable so it's also perfect they're like

1470
01:48:35,890 --> 01:48:42,970
YouTube isn't forever go back to your job you'll have no
life skills but

1471
01:48:46,030 --> 01:48:54,650
I think he was on to something I think so too oh it's
getting really rainy oh dead bodies are in here for sure oh

1472
01:48:54,650 --> 01:49:01,350
this is oh okay let's see what this one says while the
you're reading all the bad ones all the good ones are in

1473
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:09,110
here someone who prefers non-linear games this preachiness
gets annoying fast preachy yeah i'm not preachy am i just a

1474
01:49:09,110 --> 01:49:12,450
little you can tell me if i'm I'm telling you.

1475
01:49:12,990 --> 01:49:14,890
This is actually quite shocking for me.

1476
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:16,190
I always will.

1477
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:16,810
To be honest.

1478
01:49:17,290 --> 01:49:18,370
There's good ones right here.

1479
01:49:18,570 --> 01:49:19,170
Oh, there's not a bad one.

1480
01:49:19,430 --> 01:49:21,290
It's been rather terse to begin with.

1481
01:49:21,870 --> 01:49:26,370
You can't know how much fluff I cut from the game to get it
to feel as light and airy as it...

1482
01:49:26,370 --> 01:49:29,430
Well, I always thought it did, but maybe it wasn't.

1483
01:49:30,270 --> 01:49:31,390
Maybe it wasn't.

1484
01:49:31,570 --> 01:49:33,970
What an awful memory to have to hold on to.

1485
01:49:34,590 --> 01:49:38,170
These black marks are my otherwise unimpeachable track
record.

1486
01:49:38,950 --> 01:49:39,570
I mean...

1487
01:49:39,570 --> 01:49:40,410
I feel...

1488
01:49:40,510 --> 01:49:47,430
like a failure no like i let these people there's good
reviews right there terrible isn't quite as sterling as i

1489
01:49:47,430 --> 01:49:59,080
always remembered uh-oh i mean there's no such thing as a
perfect game except metal gear solid so you know you can't

1490
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:07,720
help it you can't you know you'll never be metal gear you
know what's this one got to say you constantly have to stop

1491
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:13,440
doing anything so the narrator can catch up with his
long-winded explanation of what's happening.

1492
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:15,620
I wish there was a skip button.

1493
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,460
A skip button.

1494
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:18,900
Oh.

1495
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:20,420
Well, yes.

1496
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:22,040
Yes, I think we can do that.

1497
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:27,900
If I'm truly too preachy, then maybe letting you skip ahead
for just a moment, surely it couldn't hurt.

1498
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:28,600
Surely.

1499
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:34,980
Not if it means we can strike these negative reviews from
the record, only positive reviews of the Stanley Paragraph.

1500
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:38,060
That's my motto today, and it's always been my motto.

1501
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:40,400
I'd do anything for the customer, Stanley.

1502
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,080
Wow.

1503
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:52,900
The customer is, always right skip button oh oh i think this
is that ending because we press keep pressing the skip

1504
01:50:52,900 --> 01:51:01,280
button right then we skip to the end of the life end of the
world and here it is go ahead and give it a shot i'll pop

1505
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:07,800
you forward in time so that the second my incessant droning
starts to bore you With just the push of a button, you'll

1506
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:09,140
have zipped right past it.

1507
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:09,840
Spoilers, oh.

1508
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:13,420
I'm back!

1509
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,220
Oh, you're back, you see?

1510
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:15,560
Yeah!

1511
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:21,640
You were only frozen in time for a few minutes, but it was
plenty of time for me to deliver a long, rambling monologue

1512
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:25,540
full of unnecessary verbal flourishes and lengthy
ruminations.

1513
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:26,280
One o'clock.

1514
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:34,520
Of course, I happen to believe it was perhaps one of my more
profound such ruminations, not that of course you needed.

1515
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:38,120
I'm back!

1516
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:40,480
You really did catch me rambling on a bit, didn't you?

1517
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:40,920
I did.

1518
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:42,400
But that's the power of the button.

1519
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:48,460
The minute I start to go off on a thoughtless display of
self-absorption, it's right at your fingertips to go poof,

1520
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:49,400
and it's all over.

1521
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:50,380
It's all over!

1522
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:52,600
Oh, I can't wait to see what Cookie Nine will say about
this.

1523
01:51:52,620 --> 01:51:53,400
Oh, he's probably ecstatic.

1524
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:57,840
And whether they'll edit the rating of their Steam review,
or at least change some of the wording, perhaps.

1525
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:01,960
To be honest, I don't even know if one can change their
review in the first place.

1526
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:02,460
Can you?

1527
01:52:02,540 --> 01:52:03,480
Actually, I don't know either.

1528
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:04,760
I never leave reviews.

1529
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:05,340
Oh, exactly.

1530
01:52:05,700 --> 01:52:11,920
steam works perhaps that would have been the smart thing to
check on before I went about this whole exercise of making

1531
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:19,240
the skip button this one's for you cookie nine after seeing
this exciting okay welcome back Stanley now I should say

1532
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:25,840
that the amount of time the button has been skipping through
is becoming longer and longer that last one was well I want

1533
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:33,260
to say maybe 30 45 minutes oh it's not unendurable by any
means but it's well there's really only so much I can ramble

1534
01:52:33,260 --> 01:52:39,540
on to myself about i know it's shocking isn't it but at any
rate i do suggest that we not press the button have you seen

1535
01:52:39,540 --> 01:52:46,740
the hell diver's two reviews i have not aptly demonstrated
and we can say goodbye to it and just wait how do we get out

1536
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:53,440
of here yeah there's a door go oh wasn't there a door that
led into this room there was i don't feel quite certain now

1537
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:59,620
right or what do we do how else would we have gotten into
the room in the first place i don't think one can enter a

1538
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:05,900
room without a door of some sort or a window or something
like that you see a window anywhere a porthole a

1539
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:11,340
sufficiently large crack in the wall i'll take any of these
all i want is for us to move on let's just move on yeah

1540
01:53:11,340 --> 01:53:19,500
let's let's just standy yeah stanley stanley please don't
push the button again it's been 12 hours 12 hours you've

1541
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:25,200
just been frozen there i don't know why the skips are
getting longer but they're really truly getting longer and

1542
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:26,980
my god there's no way out of the room

1543
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:39,500
cutscenes i've looked at it from every angle i've never i've
only played genshin like once so don't quite know there's

1544
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:48,900
just you and the button and if you keep pressing it i have
no idea okay oh stanley you're back you're back oh my

1545
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:57,740
goodness i have someone to talk to again stanley i i think
it's been a week for two weeks i've been sitting here all

1546
01:53:57,740 --> 01:54:04,640
that time just sitting here not a single person to speak
with and you'd think that that's just looking for my stool

1547
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:13,400
oh there it is right me talking and you saying nothing would
you think that it's exactly the same as always doesn't that

1548
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:20,780
feel like what we've already been doing me just talking but
it isn't standing it isn't the same at all it isn't even

1549
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:25,440
close because i know you can't hear me once you push that
No.

1550
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:27,360
That's what I'm realizing now, Stanley.

1551
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:28,040
Not at all.

1552
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:31,560
I'm realizing that I needed to know that someone was
listening.

1553
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:32,140
Oh.

1554
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:35,560
I needed there to be a vessel through which my words were
moving.

1555
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:40,460
Oh.

1556
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:41,300
Oh.

1557
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:42,420
Oh, hello.

1558
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:43,400
It's you.

1559
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:44,020
Hi.

1560
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:44,780
Welcome.

1561
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:50,120
I have had time to think about you and about us and about
everything we've been through.

1562
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:50,580
About us?

1563
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:52,420
I've had so much time.

1564
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:54,640
I stopped keeping track after a year.

1565
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:55,420
Oh, you!

1566
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:58,840
Have you ever sat down in one place and not moved for one
entire year?

1567
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:00,640
Let me describe it for you.

1568
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,220
To begin with, there is only regret.

1569
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:05,720
He talks like we're in a relationship.

1570
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:07,900
Like, what is going on with that?

1571
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:11,440
You know, I'm sorry I ghosted you for a year, but I just
can't help it.

1572
01:55:11,540 --> 01:55:12,080
I'm a ghost.

1573
01:55:12,580 --> 01:55:13,000
Months.

1574
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:17,400
I lost it all in a blur of the deepest longing to undo the
past.

1575
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:24,360
And when that feeling had begun to subside, what took its
place is what I can only describe as the collapse of

1576
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:24,640
every...

1577
01:55:24,660 --> 01:55:31,740
moment I have ever experienced my entire life well why
didn't you leave down into a single you're not stuck here

1578
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:39,660
too either are you I could see myself clearly calmly with a
collected heart it was an impossibly rich well-spring of

1579
01:55:39,660 --> 01:55:50,620
both delight a business goes what business are we in I could
do nothing but what felt like let's take it from the top you

1580
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:58,560
see it was a revelation for me it was Unlike anything I had
ever known, it was a space without consequence.

1581
01:55:59,780 --> 01:56:02,220
Good morning!

1582
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:03,560
Nairator!

1583
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:04,500
Oh.

1584
01:56:05,260 --> 01:56:06,300
Has that always been there?

1585
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:08,060
Nairator!

1586
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:12,660
Nairator!

1587
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:17,800
Nairator!

1588
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:17,940
Nairator!

1589
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:24,420
Hello!

1590
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:26,560
I'm alive!

1591
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:28,140
Are you alive?

1592
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:33,260
I don't know how this twig is still sitting up, you know.

1593
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:35,000
I think he's dead, Jim.

1594
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:36,040
No, he's not.

1595
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:39,040
He's taking a nap at this time, too.

1596
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:40,880
I'll see him.

1597
01:56:40,940 --> 01:56:42,280
I'll see him in the next skip.

1598
01:56:46,510 --> 01:56:47,130
Oh, that's terrible.

1599
01:56:47,690 --> 01:56:48,190
Oh, my God.

1600
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:49,270
Oh, that's terrible.

1601
01:56:49,330 --> 01:56:50,470
That's terrible, terrible noise.

1602
01:56:52,350 --> 01:56:54,330
Uh, the clock is off the wall.

1603
01:56:58,140 --> 01:57:01,520
But they didn't understand the game was never meant to be
funny.

1604
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:02,220
Oh, he's live!

1605
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:03,500
It was meant to speak.

1606
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:04,880
to the human condition.

1607
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:06,060
But where are the jokes?

1608
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:06,880
Where are the jokes?

1609
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:07,500
They bemoaned.

1610
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:08,140
They screamed.

1611
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:11,400
They gnashed their teeth and said, entertain us.

1612
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:12,360
It wasn't enough.

1613
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:17,800
They had to leave a pathetic little thumbs down review and
make all of their pitiful demands.

1614
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,640
But then, he's talking too much.

1615
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:20,320
I told you he was taking a nap.

1616
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:21,800
First, he didn't entertain us.

1617
01:57:21,860 --> 01:57:22,580
Now he won't shut up.

1618
01:57:22,580 --> 01:57:23,380
Now he won't shut up.

1619
01:57:23,660 --> 01:57:24,220
It's the inconsistency.

1620
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:25,700
It's the lack of accountability.

1621
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:26,220
Yeah, okay.

1622
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:29,420
It's the unwillingness to examine with an uncompromising
heart.

1623
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:30,200
Yeah, tell them.

1624
01:57:30,580 --> 01:57:31,540
Go off on them, narrator.

1625
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:33,380
As though there were no consequences.

1626
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:33,820
Shank him!

1627
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:35,940
Shank him in their feelings!

1628
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:39,240
But of course, absolutely anyone can leave him with you.

1629
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:40,420
So here's what we get.

1630
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:44,160
We get these demands that seek everything and are
accountable to nothing.

1631
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:47,520
We get a world where someone will say, oh, there should be a
skip button.

1632
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:48,320
There should be a skip button.

1633
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:52,300
You should be able to freeze Stanley in place while the
narrator sits there forever and ever.

1634
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:54,620
We want all of this in the new Stanley Parable.

1635
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:56,040
We demand it!

1636
01:57:56,160 --> 01:58:00,840
And then, because it was said, because it was spoken, now it
simply has to happen.

1637
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:07,060
I used to sleep again.

1638
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:09,160
It's fine, you guys.

1639
01:58:09,300 --> 01:58:09,940
He's asleep again.

1640
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:11,580
I wonder how long it's been.

1641
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:12,400
Oh.

1642
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:14,240
Takes a second.

1643
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:14,780
There we go.

1644
01:58:15,980 --> 01:58:16,740
I like to check.

1645
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:18,520
I don't know if there's anything each time.

1646
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:21,300
Anything different, but I like to check.

1647
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:24,840
He was...

1648
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:26,740
He's still just asleep, you know.

1649
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:28,740
He's still fine.

1650
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:29,900
He's still fine.

1651
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:32,280
He just took a nap, too.

1652
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:33,240
Okay.

1653
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:44,020
The end is never the end is never the end is never the end
is never the end is never the end is never the end is never

1654
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:52,220

1661
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:21,720
the end is never the end is never the end.

1662
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:25,900
Good morning.

1663
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:29,240
Whoa, it's really leaking now.

1664
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:32,280
Uh-oh, it's a little bit moldy.

1665
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:34,260
in here.

1666
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:37,660
I smell so nasty.

1667
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:43,360
Like it in a shower.

1668
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:45,320
Oh, yeah.

1669
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:47,640
Roll in it.

1670
01:59:49,700 --> 01:59:51,660
And there's never the end.

1671
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:52,840
There's never the end.

1672
01:59:53,100 --> 01:59:53,980
There's never the end.

1673
01:59:54,340 --> 01:59:56,600
How long do you guys think it's been up this point?

1674
01:59:58,540 --> 01:59:59,540
How many years?

1675
02:00:01,900 --> 02:00:02,460
Oh!

1676
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:07,560
Although it collapsed from the water.

1677
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:09,620
It's kind of dangerous, maybe.

1678
02:00:11,780 --> 02:00:12,840
It's never the end.

1679
02:00:13,020 --> 02:00:13,960
It's never the end.

1680
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:15,040
500.

1681
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:29,720
I thought I was going to sneeze.

1682
02:00:29,940 --> 02:00:31,220
Please, just let me sneeze.

1683
02:00:32,660 --> 02:00:38,040
Sometimes I need to sneeze, and even when I need to sneeze
off stream, I can't sneeze still.

1684
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:40,060
It's the worst feeling ever.

1685
02:00:46,230 --> 02:00:46,750
Oh!

1686
02:00:47,450 --> 02:00:47,970
Oh!

1687
02:00:49,030 --> 02:00:49,850
It's daylight.

1688
02:00:50,970 --> 02:00:53,390
Oh my god, I don't know the last time I've seen the
daylight.

1689
02:00:54,750 --> 02:00:55,150
Wow.

1690
02:00:57,820 --> 02:00:57,960
Oh.

1691
02:00:59,260 --> 02:01:00,220
There's flies.

1692
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:02,740
Is there...

1693
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:04,560
Is there dead body here?

1694
02:01:04,760 --> 02:01:05,260
Is it me?

1695
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:06,220
They're attached to me.

1696
02:01:06,740 --> 02:01:08,000
It's because I'm really gross.

1697
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:11,040
But I showered like...

1698
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:12,620
Like 5,000 years ago.

1699
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:14,100
What's wrong?

1700
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:20,360
Why do I hear flies?

1701
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:21,800
Oh.

1702
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:25,240
I showered, I showered.

1703
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:30,120
Oh!

1704
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:31,200
Whoa!

1705
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:34,120
Nature...

1706
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:35,880
Nature prevails.

1707
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:38,160
Whoa!

1708
02:01:42,340 --> 02:01:44,380
It's taken back over.

1709
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:48,400
Nature is healing.

1710
02:01:49,320 --> 02:01:50,420
Tokyo jungle.

1711
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:54,840
Oh.

1712
02:01:57,400 --> 02:01:58,100
No!

1713
02:02:07,110 --> 02:02:09,610
I forgot how eerie this one really gets.

1714
02:02:09,750 --> 02:02:11,650
This one's really freaky.

1715
02:02:13,470 --> 02:02:18,570
So if you die before you get a chance to shower, does that
mean you're forever stinky as a ghost for all eternity?

1716
02:02:19,190 --> 02:02:19,750
No.

1717
02:02:20,690 --> 02:02:23,890
I wash my ectoplasm almost every day.

1718
02:02:52,970 --> 02:02:54,090
Stinky ghost.

1719
02:02:54,910 --> 02:02:56,970
Takes one to no one.

1720
02:03:01,420 --> 02:03:03,060
Whoa, why am I like sideways?

1721
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:05,980
I think we're sideways.

1722
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:07,040
We're crooked.

1723
02:03:11,350 --> 02:03:13,210
Why can't we see...

1724
02:03:13,210 --> 02:03:16,850
Why is there... Why can't we see through here anymore, but
there's light over here?

1725
02:03:18,790 --> 02:03:19,910
Oh, the button's down!

1726
02:03:20,030 --> 02:03:20,950
The button's down!

1727
02:03:21,130 --> 02:03:21,630
I repeat!

1728
02:03:22,290 --> 02:03:23,550
The button is down!

1729
02:03:25,790 --> 02:03:26,430
Oh.

1730
02:03:28,070 --> 02:03:28,710
Whoa!

1731
02:03:32,670 --> 02:03:33,310
Whoa!

1732
02:03:39,030 --> 02:03:39,990
That's it.

1733
02:03:41,710 --> 02:03:42,810
But it's okay.

1734
02:03:44,390 --> 02:03:47,630
Life will be reborn on this lifeless planet.

1735
02:03:49,230 --> 02:03:49,470
Me.

1736
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:51,570
I'll start it.

1737
02:03:52,030 --> 02:03:56,910
I will spread my seed across the world.

1738
02:03:57,810 --> 02:04:00,990
I will rebuild this planet as one.

1739
02:04:01,870 --> 02:04:04,190
Everybody will become Stanley.

1740
02:04:05,330 --> 02:04:06,490
Stanleyfication.

1741
02:04:07,670 --> 02:04:11,270
From sea to shining sea.

1742
02:04:17,180 --> 02:04:18,820
I think it worked.

1743
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:20,540
Good job, guys.

1744
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:26,920
What are those emojis that are happening?

1745
02:04:27,420 --> 02:04:28,200
What is that?

1746
02:04:28,380 --> 02:04:29,740
Thanks for the don't know, though.

1747
02:04:35,090 --> 02:04:36,630
No, I don't want to be Stanley.

1748
02:04:38,270 --> 02:04:40,030
All of his co-workers were gone.

1749
02:04:40,450 --> 02:04:41,310
What could it mean?

1750
02:04:41,730 --> 02:04:43,790
Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.

1751
02:04:43,990 --> 02:04:45,610
Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.

1752
02:04:46,690 --> 02:04:47,050
Stanley.

1753
02:04:47,130 --> 02:04:50,710
Oh, new, new content.

1754
02:04:52,910 --> 02:05:01,710
I feel like, okay, as silly as this sounds, Stanley Beyond
Journey's End, as silly as this sounds, I don't think I've

1755
02:05:01,710 --> 02:05:03,830
ever gotten like the normal ending.

1756
02:05:04,270 --> 02:05:09,730
Like the, like, we follow all his prompts, we follow
everything.

1757
02:05:10,290 --> 02:05:13,250
I don't think I've ever gotten that one before.

1758
02:05:13,430 --> 02:05:20,110
I think I've always just instinctually went to against the
narrator.

1759
02:05:20,290 --> 02:05:21,670
Let's just listen to what he has to say.

1760
02:05:21,770 --> 02:05:25,150
When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the
door on his left.

1761
02:05:25,210 --> 02:05:27,290
Yeah, we're gonna follow the rules.

1762
02:05:27,490 --> 02:05:29,090
We're gonna be a little...

1763
02:05:29,090 --> 02:05:30,390
We're not gonna be...

1764
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:31,470
We're not adventurous at all.

1765
02:05:31,550 --> 02:05:32,590
I'm just a little Stanley.

1766
02:05:33,210 --> 02:05:34,890
This is shitty Stanley.

1767
02:05:35,090 --> 02:05:36,290
Yet there was not a single person here either.

1768
02:05:36,970 --> 02:05:43,950
Feeling a wave of disbelief, Stanley decided to go up to his
boss's office, hoping he might find an answer there.

1769
02:05:44,350 --> 02:05:45,210
This is Stanley.

1770
02:05:47,130 --> 02:05:57,650
upstairs to his boss's office this is stanley the good
stanley this is this is timid stanley as it is written oh

1771
02:05:57,650 --> 02:06:08,350
forgot about the bathroom money in the morning money in the
evening money for breakfast money crisp today

1772
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:20,780
npc stanley yes yes yes yes thanks for the super chat by the
way thank you stepping into his manager's office stanley was

1773
02:06:20,780 --> 02:06:29,320
once again stunned to discover not an indication of any
human life what could it mean stanley wondered aloud to

1774
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:36,900
nobody he began wildly tearing through papers on the boss's
desk pulling books off the shelf looking behind paintings

1775
02:06:36,900 --> 02:06:45,400
desperate for clues to his situation but his attention was
caught by a keypad behind the boss's desk what could its

1776
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:52,420
purpose be in fact This keypad guarded the terrible secret
that lay buried below his feet.

1777
02:06:52,940 --> 02:06:55,840
And so the boss had assigned it an extra secret pin.

1778
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:56,400
Uh-oh, wait.

1779
02:06:56,720 --> 02:06:58,560
2-8, 4-5.

1780
02:06:58,580 --> 02:06:59,440
I pressed 4!

1781
02:06:59,540 --> 02:07:06,860
But yet incredibly, by simply pushing random buttons on the
keypad, Stanley happened to input the correct code by sheer

1782
02:07:06,860 --> 02:07:07,280
luck.

1783
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:08,240
Amazing.

1784
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,660
He stepped into the newly opened passageway.

1785
02:07:12,740 --> 02:07:13,860
That's kind of crazy.

1786
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:15,220
He's not talking to me at all.

1787
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:26,420
I should have put in boob I should have put in boob 8 0 0 8

1788
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:40,080
Stanley walks straight ahead through the large door that
read mind control facility was this here before did I just

1789
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:40,980
not notice it

1790
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:56,210
escapi oh no no we're NPC Stanley we're NPC Stanley

1791
02:08:03,540 --> 02:08:04,120
Beep!

1792
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:07,720
The lights rose on an enormous room packed with television
screens.

1793
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:12,740
What horrible secret did this place hold, Stanley thought to
himself?

1794
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:15,440
Did he have the strength to find out?

1795
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:16,660
I almost just fell.

1796
02:08:18,770 --> 02:08:20,000
Why did they allow you?

1797
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:20,380
Oh my god.

1798
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:22,080
Why did they allow you to do that?

1799
02:08:22,640 --> 02:08:23,300
No way.

1800
02:08:25,970 --> 02:08:26,760
Do it.

1801
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:35,700
Aha!

1802
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:39,240
You've made it to the bottom of the mind control facility.

1803
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:40,060
Welcome!

1804
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:40,780
Welcome!

1805
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:47,860
You see, back when the Stanley Parable first launched in
2013, getting to the bottom of the mind control facility was

1806
02:08:47,860 --> 02:08:50,720
a bug that we simply didn't catch during the development.

1807
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:56,460
And you all sent us lots of photos of it on Twitter and
acted very superior about it.

1808
02:08:57,020 --> 02:08:58,660
And you're all very, very clever.

1809
02:08:58,860 --> 02:08:59,340
Good for you.

1810
02:08:59,580 --> 02:09:04,960
Anyway, when it came time to update the game, we knew that
we had to do something about this little goof of the game.

1811
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:14,120
silly guys here you go new content new content you can call
it the bottom of the mind control room ending if that

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, good job.

1819
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:11,660
You made it to the bottom of the mind control facility.

1820
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:15,140
Oh, you jumped on the catwalk.

1821
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:17,160
You should have been careful.

1822
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:18,920
I should have been careful.

1823
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:21,780
It used to be a bug.

1824
02:10:22,020 --> 02:10:22,320
A bug.

1825
02:10:22,700 --> 02:10:23,820
But now it's an ending.

1826
02:10:24,120 --> 02:10:25,420
Yeah, now it's ending.

1827
02:10:26,300 --> 02:10:28,260
I believe in you.

1828
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:31,860
I believe in your ability to cross this barrier.

1829
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:34,600
Chase your dreams?

1830
02:10:35,140 --> 02:10:38,440
Oh, oh, oh, hi, oh, hi.

1831
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:39,740
Good job.

1832
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:40,760
Good job.

1833
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:40,920
Good job.

1834
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:41,580
You did it.

1835
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:42,480
Good job.

1836
02:10:42,660 --> 02:10:43,180
You did it.

1837
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:44,060
Good job.

1838
02:10:44,200 --> 02:10:44,820
You did it.

1839
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:45,720
Good job.

1840
02:10:45,820 --> 02:10:46,540
I did it.

1841
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:48,960
Good job.

1842
02:10:49,180 --> 02:10:49,640
I did it.

1843
02:10:49,860 --> 02:10:50,520
Good job.

1844
02:10:50,660 --> 02:10:51,420
I did it.

1845
02:10:51,620 --> 02:10:52,160
Good job.

1846
02:10:52,200 --> 02:10:52,880
I did it.

1847
02:10:53,100 --> 02:10:53,720
Good job.

1848
02:10:54,060 --> 02:10:54,060
You did it.

1849
02:10:54,060 --> 02:10:54,060
Good job.

1850
02:10:54,060 --> 02:10:54,420
I did it.

1851
02:10:54,820 --> 02:10:54,820
Good.

1852
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:56,180
Oh, just kidding.

1853
02:10:56,620 --> 02:10:57,520
I don't know how to count.

1854
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:03,920
Wait, I didn't get to everyone.

1855
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:14,520
ending like I like I thought he would like I thought he
would like teleport me back or something you know oopsie all

1856
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:20,680
of his good job you did it good job you did it stanley
decided to go to the meeting room so glad they made a sequel

1857
02:11:20,680 --> 02:11:30,300
to you have to burn the rope okay la la la we're gonna get
the normal ending this time mpc mission failed no no he

1858
02:11:30,300 --> 02:11:39,600
entered the door on his left on his left on his go to the
new new yeah there was not a single person here either I

1859
02:11:39,600 --> 02:11:47,240
think the new new content is where I decided to go up to his
bosses off coming to a staircase I think that's where I

1860
02:11:47,240 --> 02:12:00,240
broke the game before the moment he entered his manager's
office Stanley froze in his tracks not a living soul

1861
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:08,300
anywhere could he really be all alone this was too much for
Stanley to take too much for stanley was in such a rush to

1862
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:16,580
get through the story as quickly as possible he didn't even
have a single minute to just let the narrator talk no time

1863
02:12:16,580 --> 02:12:24,040
to talk boob so he relaxed for a few moments with some
calming new age music okay we're getting the whole

1864
02:12:24,040 --> 02:12:26,020
soundtrack to this this time

1865
02:12:34,670 --> 02:12:46,830
feeling soothed and rejuvenated stanley calmly favorite oh
the broom closet ending my favorite play sir can i have

1866
02:12:46,830 --> 02:12:48,610
another broom closet ending

1867
02:12:54,270 --> 02:13:02,030
it wouldn't let you speed run it oh not at all it's okay i
get it they're keep they're keeping to a very strict

1868
02:13:02,030 --> 02:13:09,830
schedule i get it stanley walks straight ahead through the
large door that read mind control facility oh yeah It's

1869
02:13:09,830 --> 02:13:11,090
really tempting.

1870
02:13:14,830 --> 02:13:16,290
It's written in Quran and everything.

1871
02:13:16,470 --> 02:13:17,850
You know it was hastily done.

1872
02:13:20,930 --> 02:13:21,790
This is fine.

1873
02:13:23,090 --> 02:13:23,750
That's fine.

1874
02:13:24,610 --> 02:13:25,470
Okay, push the button.

1875
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:27,630
All right, true NPC ending.

1876
02:13:27,870 --> 02:13:28,490
Here we go.

1877
02:13:28,810 --> 02:13:31,610
The lights rose on an enormous room packed with television
screens.

1878
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:34,850
What horrible secret did this place hold?

1879
02:13:35,050 --> 02:13:36,350
Stanley thought to himself.

1880
02:13:36,910 --> 02:13:38,970
Did he have the strength to find out?

1881
02:13:39,570 --> 02:13:45,330
again but I won't do it sorry

1882
02:13:49,870 --> 02:13:58,950
you guys crayon okay are you happy oh my god can't be I
can't say anything without getting judged by your

1883
02:13:58,950 --> 02:14:10,470
insignificant details now the monitors jump to life their
true nature oh I never saw this oh Stanley's co-workers the

1884
02:14:10,470 --> 02:14:14,870
lives of so many individuals reduced to images on a screen
Reduced?

1885
02:14:15,870 --> 02:14:17,170
They've been reduced.

1886
02:14:20,490 --> 02:14:22,610
What is that one right there?

1887
02:14:23,610 --> 02:14:24,550
The one that's blue.

1888
02:14:25,970 --> 02:14:26,950
Oh, it's just kind of normal.

1889
02:14:27,970 --> 02:14:29,130
Reduced to nothing.

1890
02:14:37,750 --> 02:14:38,650
What's this?

1891
02:14:39,070 --> 02:14:41,350
This mind control facility.

1892
02:14:41,730 --> 02:14:43,330
It was too horrible to believe.

1893
02:14:43,530 --> 02:14:44,510
It couldn't be true.

1894
02:14:44,970 --> 02:14:45,710
But where are they?

1895
02:14:46,170 --> 02:14:48,070
That Stanley had been under someone's control all this time.

1896
02:14:48,090 --> 02:14:55,590
was this the only reason he was happy with his boring job
that his emotions had been manipulated to accept it blindly

1897
02:14:55,590 --> 02:15:07,870
no no I love my job no he refused to believe it yeah
couldn't accept it his own life in someone else's control

1898
02:15:07,870 --> 02:15:22,530
never never was unthinkable wasn't it was it even possible
my life I control my own fate utterly blind to the world but

1899
02:15:22,530 --> 02:15:32,270
here was the proof the heart of the operation controls
labeled with emotions happy or sad or content walking eating

1900
02:15:32,270 --> 02:15:39,070
working they controlled everything monitored and commanded
from this very place and as the cold reality of his past

1901
02:15:39,070 --> 02:15:47,450
began to sink in stanley decided that this machinery would
never again exert its terrible power over another human life

1902
02:15:47,450 --> 02:16:01,850
never again would dismantle the controls once and for all
mind controls idle awaiting input but who stops it i need a

1903
02:16:01,850 --> 02:16:19,380
stanley parable too a prequel to this uh oh don't give me a
choice here uh the patriots Hmm.

1904
02:16:28,180 --> 02:16:30,900
MPC, remember, you're right, you're right.

1905
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:33,240
Scared me.

1906
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:35,660
MPC, MPC!

1907
02:16:43,190 --> 02:16:44,750
Shut down GW.

1908
02:16:45,170 --> 02:16:47,990
We went through a microwave tunnel for this.

1909
02:16:49,250 --> 02:16:49,970
Was it over?

1910
02:16:54,270 --> 02:16:55,070
Yes.

1911
02:16:56,230 --> 02:16:57,030
He had won.

1912
02:16:57,710 --> 02:16:59,390
He had defeated the machine.

1913
02:17:00,130 --> 02:17:09,890
unshackled himself from someone else's command freedom was
mere moments away and yet even as the immense door slowly

1914
02:17:09,890 --> 02:17:19,350
opened Stanley reflected on how many puzzles still lay
unsolved where had his co-workers gone how had he been freed

1915
02:17:19,350 --> 02:17:26,650
from the machine's grasp the sky other mysteries did this
strange building hold but as sunlight streamed into the

1916
02:17:26,650 --> 02:17:35,510
chamber he realized none of this For it was not knowledge or
even power that he had been seeking, but happiness.

1917
02:17:36,410 --> 02:17:40,030
Perhaps his goal had not been to understand, but to let go.

1918
02:17:40,310 --> 02:17:40,610
Let go.

1919
02:17:41,150 --> 02:17:46,030
No longer would anyone tell him where to go, what to do, or
how to feel.

1920
02:17:46,970 --> 02:17:50,050
Whatever life he lives, it will be his.

1921
02:17:50,830 --> 02:17:53,010
And that was all he needed to know.

1922
02:17:53,730 --> 02:17:56,850
It was perhaps the only thing worth knowing.

1923
02:17:57,070 --> 02:17:57,630
Let me out.

1924
02:17:57,790 --> 02:18:00,030
Stanley stepped through the open door.

1925
02:18:03,230 --> 02:18:12,150
oh grass oh i didn't even do anything on his skin the
feeling of liberation the immense possibility of the new

1926
02:18:12,150 --> 02:18:25,630
path before him this was exactly the way right now that
things were meant to happen wow and stanley was happy wow

1927
02:18:25,630 --> 02:18:31,990
it's like a actually such like a wholesome complete the
Stanley parable.

1928
02:18:32,190 --> 02:18:33,750
Maybe we should have done this last.

1929
02:18:36,750 --> 02:18:39,350
It's actually like such a nice ending.

1930
02:18:39,990 --> 02:18:39,990
Wow.

1931
02:18:40,610 --> 02:18:45,090
It's like so like where Stanley was happy.

1932
02:18:46,390 --> 02:18:48,710
Oh, well, back in the office for you, Bozo.

1933
02:18:50,090 --> 02:18:51,150
You can never leave the office life.

1934
02:18:51,170 --> 02:18:53,350
Just a step through this door, Stanley thought to himself.

1935
02:18:53,670 --> 02:18:54,550
That's all I need.

1936
02:18:55,010 --> 02:18:58,070
If I can make it through this door, I can make it through
them all.

1937
02:18:59,050 --> 02:18:59,490
Wait, what?

1938
02:19:01,090 --> 02:19:01,890
Can I?

1939
02:19:02,870 --> 02:19:02,870
No.

1940
02:19:03,330 --> 02:19:06,350
Stanley went around touching every little thing in the
office.

1941
02:19:06,350 --> 02:19:07,970
You just told me I could go through the doors!

1942
02:19:08,910 --> 02:19:09,190
No.

1943
02:19:09,530 --> 02:19:11,890
Nor did it advance the story in any way.

1944
02:19:12,130 --> 02:19:13,870
New new content.

1945
02:19:16,190 --> 02:19:16,890
Oh good.

1946
02:19:17,170 --> 02:19:18,250
You noticed my sign.

1947
02:19:18,430 --> 02:19:18,670
I did.

1948
02:19:18,910 --> 02:19:21,650
I have something very exciting to show you.

1949
02:19:22,890 --> 02:19:23,390
Through here?

1950
02:19:23,510 --> 02:19:23,870
Through here?

1951
02:19:28,670 --> 02:19:29,230
Okay.

world turning the button on results in mintification and

1954
02:19:52,740 --> 02:19:59,640
about how roundly disappointing this ultra deluxe version
has turned out to be the original stanley parable was a

1955
02:19:59,640 --> 02:20:09,180
landmark and any new content for it should live up to that
get this ultra deluxe nonsense I say we take it one step

1956
02:20:09,180 --> 02:20:16,180
even further which is why I'm very proud to announce for the
first time is this supposed to look like this Stanley

1957
02:20:16,180 --> 02:20:29,860
parable to oh I think I remember this part far superior to a
measly re-release with a few minor additions think of all

1958
02:20:29,860 --> 02:20:36,860
the new territory will cover with a fully fledged sequel an
entirely new experience built from the ground up why there

1959
02:20:36,860 --> 02:20:44,140
are so many possibilities it could go in so many different
directions this is what fans have truly been asking for

1960
02:20:44,140 --> 02:20:58,940
investor showcase oh yeah baby two two two two two two two
okay calling it to stanley parable 2 is just so much

1961
02:20:58,940 --> 02:21:06,840
catchier than ultra deluxe don't you think sure But the
Stanley Parable 2.

1962
02:21:06,920 --> 02:21:07,080
Off page.

1963
02:21:07,340 --> 02:21:10,400
Now that's an artistic statement right there.

1964
02:21:10,860 --> 02:21:12,100
What's a TGA file?

1965
02:21:12,380 --> 02:21:17,820
It screams progress and innovation and long-term franchising
potential.

1966
02:21:18,540 --> 02:21:19,060
Potential.

1967
02:21:20,580 --> 02:21:21,260
Potential.

1968
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:22,560
Targa.

1969
02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:24,020
What's Targa?

1970
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:27,060
Type of texture file.

1971
02:21:29,960 --> 02:21:31,000
Interesting.

1972
02:21:33,820 --> 02:21:34,040
Wow.

1973
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:35,760
This is so fancy.

1974
02:21:37,060 --> 02:21:38,220
It's like a whole new...

1975
02:21:38,870 --> 02:21:40,640
Like, I mean, it is a whole new office.

1976
02:21:41,460 --> 02:21:45,120
We got modern stone, concrete wall aesthetic.

1977
02:21:45,700 --> 02:21:46,980
And they're back.

1978
02:21:47,140 --> 02:21:48,100

1984
02:22:05,770 --> 02:22:06,370
Mm-hmm.

1985
02:22:07,190 --> 02:22:07,850
What's this?

1986
02:22:09,390 --> 02:22:09,930

Sequential mind share.

2008
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:43,350
Win-win.

2009
02:23:45,150 --> 02:23:45,270

2014
02:23:48,290 --> 02:23:51,250
I don't know anything about... Oh my gosh.

2015
02:23:51,750 --> 02:23:52,390
Look at that!

2016
02:23:52,690 --> 02:23:56,050
Oh, I kinda like this one down here.

2017
02:23:56,170 --> 02:23:59,950
I kinda like the Stanley Parable with the two lines inside.

2018
02:24:00,390 --> 02:24:01,530
Thanks for attending my meeting.

2019
02:24:02,810 --> 02:24:03,670
The other ones are whatever.

2020
02:24:04,630 --> 02:24:07,950
The second one reminds me of Red Dead Redemption, I think.

2021
02:24:11,230 --> 02:24:13,690
I never had an ending with the ferns.

2022
02:24:15,690 --> 02:24:16,250
Oh,

2023
02:24:21,020 --> 02:24:22,440
I thought this was nude Stanley.

2024
02:24:22,960 --> 02:24:28,360
Now, to be clear, I haven't quite nailed down what exactly
the Stanley Parable 2 is going to be.

2025
02:24:28,780 --> 02:24:32,280
But let's take a look at some of the features I've been
developing for it.

2026
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:32,820
Okay.

2027
02:24:32,820 --> 02:24:38,940
I figure that if I can loosely organize a handful of
interesting concepts, that surely the game will sort of

2028
02:24:38,940 --> 02:24:41,180
naturally spring up around them.

2029
02:24:41,420 --> 02:24:42,880
It'll all work itself out.

2030
02:24:43,280 --> 02:24:53,940
development is much more of a fuzzy magic than anything
scientific or this is so relatable to two eyes two ears two

2031
02:24:53,940 --> 02:25:13,180
nostrils two arms two legs what the perfect Stanley the end
is never the end again Stanley Parable 2 now with blockchain

2032
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:28,080
an ai no sequels are good portal 2 half-life 2 batman arkham
asylum 2 metal gear solid 2 doom 2 divinity original sin 2

2033
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:32,620
Aladdin 2 return of jafar dark souls 2

2034
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:52,840
hmm doom 2 the prequel to the stanley parable two is the
sequel to the Stanley Parable is the prequel to the Stanley

2035
02:25:52,840 --> 02:26:06,920
Parable Two is the sequel to the Stanley Parable is the
prequel Two, Two Nice Every pause button Is it Roman numeral

2036
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:23,450
No, Roman numeral two The show Floor Wow, new Oh, yeah Oh,
thank you Oh Thank you.

2037
02:26:23,530 --> 02:26:25,850
What are you wearing tonight, Bint?

2038
02:26:26,410 --> 02:26:29,550
I'm wearing your mom's dress from last night.

2039
02:26:29,950 --> 02:26:30,430
Thank you.

2040
02:26:30,610 --> 02:26:31,730
Thank you.

2041
02:26:31,970 --> 02:26:32,570
Thank you.

2042
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:36,040
No other questions.

2043
02:26:36,200 --> 02:26:37,060
Thank you so much.

2044
02:26:37,340 --> 02:26:37,880
Thank you.

2045
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:40,040
Oh, God.

2046
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:47,080
Here we are.

2047
02:26:47,320 --> 02:26:47,760
Go on.

2048
02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:49,680
Try out some of the new features.

2049
02:26:50,420 --> 02:26:50,700
Wow.

2050
02:26:51,860 --> 02:26:53,320
I do remember this part a little bit.

2051
02:26:55,800 --> 02:26:57,760
Hear your name in the game.

2052
02:26:57,780 --> 02:27:09,040
the button that says the name of the player that is playing
the game for the stanley parable 2 i asked myself what do

2053
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:17,160
players really want and of course the first and most obvious
answer is that they want to be individually recognized and

2054
02:27:17,160 --> 02:27:24,360
validated as people so with that in mind my first addition
to the game is this demo and the demo which speaks the name

2055
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:28,320
Wonderful.

2056
02:27:33,410 --> 02:27:35,910
I remember the last time that it's not saying my name.

2057
02:27:53,580 --> 02:27:55,080
Thanks for the super chat.

2058
02:27:55,420 --> 02:27:56,520
I'm glad I could make you smile.

2059
02:27:58,160 --> 02:27:59,080
It's gonna say mint.

2060
02:28:00,920 --> 02:28:07,860
And if it doesn't say any, if it says anything else, if it
says anything else, it's the docks button.

2061
02:28:07,980 --> 02:28:09,220
You guys are scaring me.

2062
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:11,700
It's going to say mint.

2063
02:28:12,540 --> 02:28:13,200
It's going to say mint.

2064
02:28:14,420 --> 02:28:14,780
Jim.

2065
02:28:15,420 --> 02:28:17,480
Sorry, I should have clarified.

2066
02:28:18,100 --> 02:28:20,640
Right now, the button only says the name Jim.

2067
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:25,660
But of course, in the final game, this button will say your
name, whatever name that is.

2068
02:28:26,280 --> 02:28:31,240
Here, let's have you roleplay as Jim to really simulate the
full experience of this feature.

2069
02:28:31,380 --> 02:28:32,580
I'm Jim's Phantom!

2070
02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:34,000
I promise you'll love it.

2071
02:28:34,480 --> 02:28:35,420
Okay, here we go.

2072
02:28:35,460 --> 02:28:35,780
Jim.

2073
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:42,200
Let's take a deep breath, clear your mind, forget whoever
you are, and simply become a person named Jim.

2074
02:28:43,100 --> 02:28:44,760
I want you to imagine yourself.

2075
02:28:45,100 --> 02:28:53,220
as Jim oh god I'm really sad and waking as Jim falling in
love and being heartbroken as Jim seizing all of the world's

2076
02:28:53,220 --> 02:29:01,720
possibilities as Jim and as Jim watching your dreams crumble
into dust do you feel it deeply are you really truly Jim

2077
02:29:01,720 --> 02:29:15,540
right now if so then please step forward and press the
button I'm Jim I'm Jim Jim yes you see what a What a thrill!

2078
02:29:15,540 --> 02:29:16,160
What a thrill!

2079
02:29:17,100 --> 02:29:17,720
What a thrill!

2080
02:29:17,720 --> 02:29:18,660
The button described you.

2081
02:29:18,880 --> 02:29:19,280
Do it again.

2082
02:29:19,400 --> 02:29:19,760
Do it again.

2083
02:29:22,460 --> 02:29:29,540
I think I'm really starting to like, you know, it's one of
those like, keep, think until you believe it sort of for

2084
02:29:29,540 --> 02:29:32,620
things, you know, like, Jim.

2085
02:29:33,540 --> 02:29:35,800
It hits even harder the second time.

2086
02:29:36,040 --> 02:29:40,920
If this were the only new feature in the Stanley Parable 2,
it would still be worth the money.

2087
02:29:41,480 --> 02:29:43,200
Let's take a break from the Jim button.

2088
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:46,820
I'm too emotionally drained from all of this personal
validation.

2089
02:29:48,880 --> 02:29:52,740
Hold on, I'm just changing the stream title a little bit.

2090
02:29:55,100 --> 02:29:55,660
There we go.

2091
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:56,160
Cool.

2092
02:29:56,840 --> 02:29:56,840
Jim.

2093
02:29:57,260 --> 02:29:58,520
Oh, there, cowboy.

2094
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,160
Sometimes a person can be too much, Jim.

2095
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:03,400
I'm putting the Jim button away.

2096
02:30:03,420 --> 02:30:03,980
No!

2097
02:30:04,180 --> 02:30:07,840
Otherwise, soon you'll start to lose all sense of who you
actually are.

2098
02:30:09,340 --> 02:30:11,180
You can't stop me.

2099
02:30:11,640 --> 02:30:12,440
You can't!

2100
02:30:12,440 --> 02:30:13,180
Did that mean...

2101
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:15,160
You can't deny me my identity!

2102
02:30:21,070 --> 02:30:21,590
Anyway.

2103
02:30:24,250 --> 02:30:25,110
I felt good.

2104
02:30:26,330 --> 02:30:28,390
I felt good, you know, when I...

2105
02:30:29,090 --> 02:30:34,470
When I died, there were some things that I lost, some
memories, you know, but now I feel...

2106
02:30:34,470 --> 02:30:41,490
I feel this post-gym clarity that I just never thought that
I would ever, you know...

2107
02:30:41,490 --> 02:30:42,190
Feel.

2108
02:30:44,750 --> 02:30:46,210
It's the dead tree.

2109
02:30:48,550 --> 02:30:49,970
It's still here.

2110
02:30:52,730 --> 02:30:56,590
I suppose I could allow only people named Jim to play the
Stanley Parable 2.

2111
02:30:56,970 --> 02:30:59,530
That would actually save me the work of finishing this
feature.

2112
02:31:01,690 --> 02:31:03,130
Don't be lazy, narrator.

2113
02:31:03,370 --> 02:31:03,810
Don't be lazy.

2114
02:31:04,090 --> 02:31:05,350
No screenshots, everybody.

2115
02:31:07,290 --> 02:31:08,530
Whole new office.

2116
02:31:10,790 --> 02:31:11,350
999.

2117
02:31:11,750 --> 02:31:12,830
Red is the new or.

2118
02:31:16,910 --> 02:31:18,150
Is that coming around the game?

2119
02:31:18,910 --> 02:31:21,530
Uh, uh, uh, wait, is that for me or...

2120
02:31:24,330 --> 02:31:25,210
Chimperms revoked.

2121
02:31:28,310 --> 02:31:31,090
New features, new content, new ideas.

2122
02:31:32,590 --> 02:31:36,530
New updated rate traced more of the same, but in a good way,
sequel to the...

2123
02:31:41,540 --> 02:31:42,900
Okay, I think it's in the game.

2124
02:31:43,220 --> 02:31:44,300
Oh my god, that scared me.

2125
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:45,640
The baby!

2126
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:48,840
The button baby, button baby!

2127
02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:50,120
Baby is all grown.

2128
02:31:51,640 --> 02:31:55,220
Button baby, button baby, button baby.

2129
02:31:57,120 --> 02:32:00,440
Consistent quality with just the right amount of change.

2130
02:32:03,080 --> 02:32:04,200
Shween shaders.

2131
02:32:05,820 --> 02:32:06,660
Oh, the bucket.

2132
02:32:09,460 --> 02:32:10,320
No screenshots.

2133
02:32:11,180 --> 02:32:11,500
Is that?

2134
02:32:11,700 --> 02:32:12,600
Oh my god, it's me.

2135
02:32:12,780 --> 02:32:13,880
Whoa, I'm tall.

2136
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:17,900
I grew like an extra foot or so.

2137
02:32:21,440 --> 02:32:32,320
got collectibles turning me into a you twos oh yeah stanley
you twos free new and easy achievement

2138
02:32:36,320 --> 02:32:50,520
can you find them collect them all ah collectibles now it's
a real video game in the stanley parable 2 you'll run around

2139
02:32:50,520 --> 02:32:57,160
gathering up these miniature stanley figurines and what's
truly innovative is that there will be no reward for

2140
02:32:57,160 --> 02:32:58,280
collecting all of them.

2141
02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:02,240
I don't want to stifle the intrinsic joy of watching a
number go up.

2142
02:33:02,540 --> 02:33:07,760
You simply collect all of them and then you move the hell on
with your unremarkable life.

2143
02:33:24,780 --> 02:33:26,940
How am I gonna become like that?

2144
02:33:30,680 --> 02:33:31,000
Oh!

2145
02:33:32,120 --> 02:33:32,700
Yippee!

2146
02:33:40,910 --> 02:33:47,630
give me out of there god it really is the worst when you
collect everything in a video game and then they give you a

2147
02:33:47,630 --> 02:33:58,830
big fancy reward for it absolutely tragic so true so true so
true i don't need a reward i don't want anything

2148
02:34:04,830 --> 02:34:05,750
Ten dollars.

2149
02:34:05,910 --> 02:34:06,510
Thank you for the donation.

2150
02:34:06,730 --> 02:34:07,270
Oh my gosh, my brain.

2151
02:34:07,890 --> 02:34:08,350
Thank you.

2152
02:34:10,030 --> 02:34:10,910
Jump circle.

2153
02:34:11,250 --> 02:34:11,970
Oh, we had that.

2154
02:34:12,090 --> 02:34:12,470
We had that.

2155
02:34:12,710 --> 02:34:13,430
This map.

2156
02:34:13,650 --> 02:34:14,410
Free achievement.

2157
02:34:15,430 --> 02:34:16,910
Where do we get the achievement at?

2158
02:34:18,370 --> 02:34:18,850
Q.

2159
02:34:20,810 --> 02:34:22,330
So, what's N?

2160
02:34:23,190 --> 02:34:25,290
N is the jump circle.

2161
02:34:26,170 --> 02:34:27,730
This is the jump circle, right?

2162
02:34:29,510 --> 02:34:30,570
Oh, there it is.

2163
02:34:30,590 --> 02:34:31,930
There's a sign for it.

2164
02:34:32,130 --> 02:34:32,970
You know what, Stanley?

2165
02:34:33,150 --> 02:34:34,430
I actually think the jump circle...

2166
02:34:34,450 --> 02:34:39,370
circle was a pretty good idea i'd like to hang on to that i
only oh this is the 10 that i have left

2167
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:59,540
nice free achievement pull the lever receive your new
achievement no more steps it just works now here's something

2168
02:34:59,540 --> 02:35:05,440
special you remember that broken test achievement that got
left in the game on accident yeah i'm developing a

2169
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:08,720
technology to simply give you the achievement Yes.

2170
02:35:09,220 --> 02:35:13,780
You see, you'll come to this lever and when you pull it, the
achievement will be given to you.

2171
02:35:13,940 --> 02:35:14,340
It's a sin.

2172
02:35:14,540 --> 02:35:16,180
Okay, perhaps I should have clarified.

2173
02:35:16,420 --> 02:35:18,140
This is technology that will exist.

2174
02:35:18,520 --> 02:35:21,220
Right now, the achievement is still fully broken.

2175
02:35:21,480 --> 02:35:24,980
I'm not a wizard Stanley, but I guarantee it will be fixed
in the season.

2176
02:35:24,980 --> 02:35:26,040
Come on, narrator.

2177
02:35:26,920 --> 02:35:29,120
You're busting my balls here, narrator.

2178
02:35:30,340 --> 02:35:30,420
Please.

2179
02:35:32,300 --> 02:35:32,820
Gamers.

2180
02:35:33,440 --> 02:35:34,060
We hear you.

2181
02:35:34,140 --> 02:35:34,520
Gamers.

2182
02:35:35,420 --> 02:35:36,800
Rise up, gamers.

2183
02:35:36,800 --> 02:35:44,310
I cannot believe this.

2184
02:35:44,950 --> 02:35:45,290
What else?

2185
02:35:45,650 --> 02:35:47,490
What other exhibits haven't we seen yet?

2186
02:35:48,770 --> 02:35:49,170
The bucket?

2187
02:35:49,930 --> 02:35:50,710
What's in here?

2188
02:35:52,690 --> 02:35:53,510
Okay, I'll be honest.

2189
02:35:53,750 --> 02:35:55,230
I haven't yet decided on this one.

2190
02:35:55,350 --> 02:35:55,770
What is this?

2191
02:35:55,890 --> 02:36:01,250
I think that in the new version, the office could use a bit
of decoration like balloons.

2192
02:36:01,350 --> 02:36:06,490
But I'm undecided on get well someday and happy 12th
birthday.

2193
02:36:06,970 --> 02:36:08,010
Which would you go with?

2194
02:36:08,370 --> 02:36:17,990
I think I'd get well someday you know sometimes when you
solicit another person's opinion it makes you realize that

2195
02:36:17,990 --> 02:36:28,690
you knew which one you actually really wanted all along I
hate you narrator step niece it is I hate you narrator this

2196
02:36:28,690 --> 02:36:42,920
one is stuck this one this one it won't even this one okay
oh my god all right actually maybe i should have gone with

2197
02:36:42,920 --> 02:36:55,880
no no i've made my decision we're moving on we're moving on
the end is never the end is never the end would you wear

2198
02:36:55,880 --> 02:37:05,200
these this t-shirt is the new that is the best new feature i
saw the new content oh the bucket that's right let's go get

2199
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:12,240
our bucket that code works wait what code Which one?

2200
02:37:12,820 --> 02:37:13,680
I didn't see a code.

2201
02:37:17,100 --> 02:37:18,100
Oh, the QR code.

2202
02:37:18,900 --> 02:37:20,440
Oh, I don't have my phone on me, you guys.

2203
02:37:20,580 --> 02:37:21,540
I don't know where my phone is.

2204
02:37:27,100 --> 02:37:28,580
I think I left it somewhere.

2205
02:37:28,760 --> 02:37:30,480
I think I left it after when I was cooking.

2206
02:37:32,580 --> 02:37:33,360
I'll try it here.

2207
02:37:34,100 --> 02:37:35,160
I left it up there.

2208
02:37:35,260 --> 02:37:36,240
Everybody else can check it.

2209
02:37:37,440 --> 02:37:38,060
There you go.

2210
02:37:38,180 --> 02:37:39,060
Go ahead and scan.

2211
02:37:39,220 --> 02:37:40,180
Go ahead and scan.

2212
02:37:42,640 --> 02:37:44,260
Go ahead and scan.

2213
02:37:44,480 --> 02:37:45,600
Go ahead and scan.

2214
02:37:48,320 --> 02:37:51,400
The button that says Jim like Jameson.

2215
02:37:52,240 --> 02:37:52,400
Oh.

2216
02:37:53,540 --> 02:37:54,780
Looks so sad.

2217
02:38:01,430 --> 02:38:08,550
A common complaint of the Stanley Parable was that it was
confusing and paradoxical that it engendered a chaotic sense

2218
02:38:08,550 --> 02:38:11,070
of reckless despair in those who played it.

2219
02:38:11,470 --> 02:38:11,730
Nice.

2220
02:38:12,150 --> 02:38:18,930
I'm happy to say that after much consideration yeah I've
engineered a clever solution to this fundamental problem

2221
02:38:18,930 --> 02:38:27,470
with the game okay it's the Stanley Parable reassurance
bucket you see Stanley anytime you're holding the bucket a

2222
02:38:27,470 --> 02:38:35,230
sense of calm and ease will fill your mind and your heart
it's true as long as you hold on to the bucket the many

2223
02:38:35,230 --> 02:38:43,330
disorienting contradictions of the Stanley Parable will feel
perfectly normal and perhaps even comforting you may even

2224
02:38:43,330 --> 02:38:50,450
come to long for the gentle embrace of jarring cognitive
dissonance while the bucket is in your arms and to be honest

2225
02:38:50,450 --> 02:38:57,610
it's a much more convenient solution for me than actually
redesigning the game to be less uncomfortable can you

2226
02:38:57,610 --> 02:39:05,650
imagine what a pain in the ass that would be yes the bucket
is the perfect solution come on give it a try wait can I

2227
02:39:05,650 --> 02:39:07,550
walk here okay Okay.

2228
02:39:09,510 --> 02:39:10,030
Okay.

2229
02:39:15,650 --> 02:39:16,410
Why are you laughing?

2230
02:39:16,470 --> 02:39:17,010
Can you feel it?

2231
02:39:17,710 --> 02:39:23,830
The glow of comfort, even in the face of crushing despair,
must already be sweeping through your body.

2232
02:39:24,290 --> 02:39:25,810
This is my second cult.

2233
02:39:25,830 --> 02:39:29,090
Can I say that I do believe the bucket lends you an air of
charisma as well?

2234
02:39:29,290 --> 02:39:29,690
It does.

2235
02:39:29,830 --> 02:39:30,470
I think so.

2236
02:39:30,590 --> 02:39:34,490
I think that just holding it has made you the slightest bit
more attractive as a person.

2237
02:39:34,630 --> 02:39:35,490
Do you think I think so?

2238
02:39:35,490 --> 02:39:38,450
The benefits of the bucket seem to go on and on, don't they?

2239
02:39:39,350 --> 02:39:43,110
All this and more await you in the Stanley Parable 2.

2240
02:39:43,290 --> 02:39:44,410
I think so, honestly.

2241
02:39:45,450 --> 02:39:46,810
I feel really...

2242
02:39:46,810 --> 02:39:50,650
Look, like, I come walking out, and I feel like...

2243
02:39:50,650 --> 02:39:51,510
Oh!

2244
02:39:53,010 --> 02:39:53,570
No!

2245
02:39:54,130 --> 02:39:54,930
No, no.

2246
02:39:55,330 --> 02:39:55,890
Stop.

2247
02:39:56,890 --> 02:39:57,450
Stop.

2248
02:39:57,810 --> 02:39:59,810
Stop it.

2249
02:39:59,850 --> 02:40:00,330
Oh, my God.

2250
02:40:01,450 --> 02:40:01,910
Just...

2251
02:40:01,910 --> 02:40:02,170
Oh, my God.

2252
02:40:02,210 --> 02:40:05,470
Does anyone give out awards for most enjoyable bucky...

2253
02:40:05,490 --> 02:40:13,390
in a video game i don't know that really should be an award
if it isn't already oh wait it's like i can like see this

2254
02:40:13,390 --> 02:40:21,490
girl over here she's like been staring at me she's like i've
been looking at you from ever since you walked into the room

2255
02:40:21,490 --> 02:40:31,170
your bucket is really alluring and a bit i'd be like yeah my
bucket is like you know it's pretty cool it's it's you know

2256
02:40:31,170 --> 02:40:33,810
i've been with this bucket for a long time.

2257
02:40:34,510 --> 02:40:36,750
Do you want to touch my bucket?

2258
02:40:36,930 --> 02:40:38,690
She's like, is it okay?

2259
02:40:39,350 --> 02:40:46,610
I mean, I don't want to be I don't want to be too forward,
but like, be my first time touching someone's bucket before.

2260
02:40:47,910 --> 02:40:48,750
And be like, it's okay.

2261
02:40:50,210 --> 02:40:56,530
I don't normally let people do this, but you know, you can
you can even hold it if you want.

2262
02:40:56,690 --> 02:40:57,390
She's like, wow.

2263
02:40:58,230 --> 02:41:02,370
And then she takes it, and she's like, she's like cradling
it like a baby.

2264
02:41:02,390 --> 02:41:14,910
and she's just like gosh this just feels really natural like
I just feel I feel I feel like I should have met you a long

2265
02:41:14,910 --> 02:41:29,530
time ago I'm like you know what it doesn't matter we can
make up for lost time sweet Caroline Baa Baa Baa!

2266
02:41:31,110 --> 02:41:32,470
Oh, infinite hole!

2267
02:41:36,540 --> 02:41:37,920
Okay, I'm not gonna lie.

2268
02:41:38,580 --> 02:41:44,360
I'm pretty sure this is where my game worked last time.

2269
02:41:47,060 --> 02:41:49,620
I think this is where my game froze before.

2270
02:41:50,540 --> 02:41:51,740
In the infinite hole.

2271
02:41:52,040 --> 02:41:53,460
So I'm a little scared of going in there.

2272
02:41:53,480 --> 02:41:55,620
Stanley, here's an idea that I'm truly fond of.

2273
02:41:55,740 --> 02:41:57,760
It's never been done before in a video game.

2274
02:41:59,080 --> 02:42:08,240
a hole that you can fall down forever that's right infinite
falling you can fall until the end of time if you like a

2275
02:42:08,240 --> 02:42:11,360
stunning leap forward for video games as a medium

2276
02:42:27,700 --> 02:42:37,760
oh it's so quiet I thought I could see it from up there oh I
think as hey how could I see I thought I saw it from up here

2277
02:42:37,760 --> 02:42:56,420
how is that possible am I crazy I thought I saw it from here
weird it calls okay okay guys oh

2278
02:42:59,800 --> 02:43:12,160
the roof lowered okay here we go to quote sight from
yesterday what the fuck wonderful one of my more ingenious

2279
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:20,360
concoctions if I do say so now then since you've gotten to
see the infinite hole you can press the teleport button to

2280
02:43:20,360 --> 02:43:28,760
pop back up to the top and we can continue onward gee to
return to the surface but there's an end right now I don't

2281
02:43:28,760 --> 02:43:35,460
mean to be a bummer but I do recommend you use the teleport
button to go back to the teleport maybe do it on the sooner

2282
02:43:35,460 --> 02:43:38,600
rather than later spectrum of things

2283
02:43:42,330 --> 02:43:48,030
what's that sound it's like kind of crunchy okay Stanley I
don't know quite how to say this tactfully but it's possible

2284
02:43:48,030 --> 02:43:51,570
that I slightly exaggerated the infinite nature of the hole.

2285
02:43:52,070 --> 02:43:52,070
Okay.

2286
02:43:52,270 --> 02:43:53,970
Is it a very, very deep hole?

2287
02:43:54,310 --> 02:43:55,190
To be certain it is.

2288
02:43:55,490 --> 02:43:55,730
Wow.

2289
02:43:55,910 --> 02:43:57,410
It's an extremely deep hole.

2290
02:43:57,570 --> 02:43:58,250
It's extremely deep.

2291
02:43:58,250 --> 02:44:01,270
I don't want anyone to say that it isn't an astonishingly
deep hole.

2292
02:44:01,450 --> 02:44:01,750
It is.

2293
02:44:01,990 --> 02:44:03,130
Is it infinite?

2294
02:44:03,550 --> 02:44:06,950
Well, that sort of depends on your definition of infinity.

2295
02:44:07,510 --> 02:44:11,650
From one perspective, the infinite is merely philosophical
in nature.

2296
02:44:11,790 --> 02:44:12,710
It's more of a...

2297
02:44:12,710 --> 02:44:12,950
Ow!

2298
02:44:14,130 --> 02:44:16,030
Okay, well, good for you.

2299
02:44:16,130 --> 02:44:17,330
You found the bottom of the hole.

2300
02:44:17,350 --> 02:44:25,130
hole you found me out Stanley I'm a liar and a cheat and
you're so clever look I think the issue here is just that

2301
02:44:25,130 --> 02:44:33,590
you're unusually fascinated by falling what normal person
actually wants to fall infinitely I figured the hole was as

2302
02:44:33,590 --> 02:44:38,690
deep as anyone would actually need don't you put this on me
maybe you're the My lunch!

2303
02:44:40,310 --> 02:44:43,030
Look, things got a little heated there.

2304
02:44:43,110 --> 02:44:45,230
I think we both said some things we didn't mean.

2305
02:44:45,670 --> 02:44:52,170
Why don't we just put all this behind us and agree to just
call the hole mostly infinite?

2306
02:44:53,350 --> 02:44:59,070
If that works for you, then go ahead and press the teleport
button to warp up to the top of the hole and we can move on.

2307
02:44:59,370 --> 02:45:01,070
I'll just be up here when you're ready.

2308
02:45:01,950 --> 02:45:03,050
There's nothing else, right?

2309
02:45:05,130 --> 02:45:05,810
That's it?

2310
02:45:06,690 --> 02:45:07,890
Just the two of...

2311
02:45:07,910 --> 02:45:21,030
us we can make it if we try just the two of us just the two
of us just the two of us building castles in the sky just

2312
02:45:21,030 --> 02:45:38,100
the two of us you and I great now I'm very excited to show
you oh for heaven I was right the problem is you the problem

2313
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:40,020
is that you like holes too much.

2314
02:45:40,020 --> 02:45:41,220
I love holes!

2315
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:45,080
A normal person would have said, yep, that's an infinite
hole right there.

2316
02:45:45,360 --> 02:45:46,820
Goes on forever till the end of time.

2317
02:45:47,080 --> 02:45:48,800
Don't need to see it all, but not you.

2318
02:45:49,180 --> 02:45:49,360
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2319
02:45:49,360 --> 02:45:52,180
You become tied for my favorite.

2320
02:45:52,280 --> 02:45:53,280
Oh, streamer.

2321
02:45:54,620 --> 02:45:55,420
Thank you!

2322
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:56,900
I'll give over to the concert in July.

2323
02:45:56,980 --> 02:45:57,600
Thank you so much!

2324
02:45:58,020 --> 02:46:01,660
I couldn't help but feel like you spent a little less time
in there than you did before.

2325
02:46:01,940 --> 02:46:07,800
I mean, admittedly, I didn't make an infinite hole, but I
didn't think it was that not infinite.

2326
02:46:08,100 --> 02:46:08,940
Oh, I got shorter!

2327
02:46:08,960 --> 02:46:10,620
I suppose once again there's nothing to do here.

2328
02:46:10,820 --> 02:46:16,840
If you decide you've had enough of the hole, you can hit the
teleport button and come join me up above.

2329
02:46:30,660 --> 02:46:32,360
I love the eclipse.

2330
02:46:33,620 --> 02:46:38,080
That the hole is not only not infinite, but that it's
growing steadily less and less.

2331
02:46:38,100 --> 02:46:39,060
I love off.

2332
02:46:39,260 --> 02:46:45,400
I suspect that I'm starting to hit the point where it's no
longer feasible to call the hole infinitely deep, even by

2333
02:46:45,400 --> 02:46:47,880
the lax overall standards for accountability and marketing.

2334
02:46:47,880 --> 02:46:48,980
Not even a little bit.

2335
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:49,860
What's going on here?

2336
02:46:50,400 --> 02:46:54,520
Stanley, I have no explanation for the uncertain nature of
the hole's length.

2337
02:46:55,060 --> 02:46:56,620
Here, let's try something.

2338
02:46:56,800 --> 02:46:57,020
Okay.

2339
02:46:57,120 --> 02:47:00,400
Let's pop back up to the top and we'll see if it gets any
shorter.

2340
02:47:00,520 --> 02:47:00,740
Okay.

2341
02:47:01,440 --> 02:47:02,140
Well, there it is.

2342
02:47:02,320 --> 02:47:02,480
Oh!

2343
02:47:02,700 --> 02:47:03,980
The shame of my liars come out.

2344
02:47:03,980 --> 02:47:04,220
Oh.

2345
02:47:05,020 --> 02:47:05,460
Oh.

2346
02:47:05,880 --> 02:47:06,320
Sorry.

2347
02:47:06,520 --> 02:47:08,080
I know you're obsessed with holes.

2348
02:47:08,100 --> 02:47:17,280
but at this depth I just can't see this scratching the itch
oh who am I to judge you just do whatever it is you're here

2349
02:47:17,280 --> 02:47:29,480
to do it feels like a wild instinct to jump into a hole
you're ready to move on oh oh oh oh I thought it was my game

2350
02:47:29,480 --> 02:47:35,900
it's not working yes oh I thought I really don't have an
explanation it was Just climb out!

2351
02:47:36,560 --> 02:47:37,140
Just try it again.

2352
02:47:39,840 --> 02:47:40,680
Still nothing.

2353
02:47:41,480 --> 02:47:42,060
Well, I suppose...

2354
02:47:42,060 --> 02:47:42,560
I can't jump.

2355
02:47:43,220 --> 02:47:43,960
I can't do anything.

2356
02:47:45,580 --> 02:47:45,820
Okay.

2357
02:47:45,960 --> 02:47:46,400
I'm out.

2358
02:47:46,940 --> 02:47:47,080
I can't do anything.

2359
02:47:47,100 --> 02:47:47,500
Goodbye, Stanley.

2360
02:47:47,900 --> 02:47:49,700
You couldn't bear to hear it from the whole.

2361
02:47:49,920 --> 02:47:53,380
And now you'll get more time with it than you could ever
have asked for.

2362
02:47:53,640 --> 02:47:55,120
It's a win for everyone.

2363
02:47:55,480 --> 02:47:56,740
You get to be with the whole.

2364
02:47:57,080 --> 02:47:59,380
I get to do literally anything else.

2365
02:48:00,260 --> 02:48:01,400
Take care, Stanley.

2366
02:48:02,020 --> 02:48:04,840
I hope you and the whole have a wonderful rest of it.

2367
02:48:04,960 --> 02:48:05,440
Wait!

2368
02:48:07,640 --> 02:48:12,420

Baby, baby, baby, baby.

2370
02:48:17,680 --> 02:48:18,380
What's going on?

2371
02:48:19,620 --> 02:48:20,520
Is someone coming?

2372
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:22,800
Is someone...

2373
02:48:22,800 --> 02:48:24,360
G-G-G-G-G-G-G.

2374
02:48:27,660 --> 02:48:29,040
It's not moving, is it?

2375
02:48:29,920 --> 02:48:31,480
Or are my eyes tricking me?

2376
02:48:31,500 --> 02:48:33,420
It looked like it was growing down for a second.

2377
02:48:35,280 --> 02:48:36,200
Oh!

2378
02:49:05,650 --> 02:49:09,610
This hole was made for man.

2379
02:49:11,430 --> 02:49:12,490
Change my perspective.

2380
02:49:12,830 --> 02:49:12,910
Ah!

2381
02:49:19,050 --> 02:49:20,430

2384
02:49:31,430 --> 02:49:33,330
Wait, how do I get back to normal?

2385
02:49:33,350 --> 02:49:36,010
Oh, change your perception.

02:49:42,230 --> 02:49:43,380

2391
02:49:55,710 --> 02:49:56,870
What is this?

2392
02:50:15,140 --> 02:50:17,420
My head's stronger.

2393
02:50:17,940 --> 02:50:21,420
You're no longer using your head.

2394
02:50:21,440 --> 02:50:23,440

2395
02:50:33,660 --> 02:50:40,640

Change your reality.

2399
02:51:26,730 --> 02:51:28,850
What is going on?

2400
02:51:29,430 --> 02:51:30,110

Go on.

2410
02:52:39,180 --> 02:52:40,780
Try out some of the new features.

2411
02:52:41,800 --> 02:52:42,040
Wait.

2412
02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:44,640
But I already have a bucket.

2413
02:52:44,760 --> 02:52:45,660

2421
02:53:13,770 --> 02:53:14,690
The new door?

2422
02:53:14,890 --> 02:53:16,110
It says it's new.

2423
02:53:17,550 --> 02:53:18,630
I don't think so.

2424
02:53:18,690 --> 02:53:19,750
Let's check out the map.

2425
02:53:19,970 --> 02:53:20,750

Oh, I think it's what I'm looking at up here.

2441
02:53:55,810 --> 02:53:57,330
Should I use up the rest of my jumps?

2442
02:54:06,940 --> 02:54:09,420
The settings world champion, I could still do it.

2443
02:54:09,520 --> 02:54:10,420
Where was it, though?

2444
02:54:11,180 --> 02:54:11,720

2462
02:56:30,970 --> 02:56:31,930
Oh, this one, too.

It's just, like, the most satisfying thing I've ever...

2466
02:56:58,880 --> 02:57:00,360
I could listen to this forever.

2467
02:57:00,580 --> 02:57:01,600
Sorry, I know I'm not talking.

2468
02:57:01,800 --> 02:57:02,980
It's because it just sounds so good.

2469
02:57:12,250 --> 02:57:13,730
I don't think I changed anything, so yeah.

2470
02:57:15,370 --> 02:57:16,990
I don't want to delete the save data!

2471
02:57:19,430 --> 02:57:21,990
Do I have to do all the resolutions and everything?

2472
02:57:24,610 --> 02:57:26,450
Oh, it just sounds so good.

2473
02:57:34,960 --> 02:57:35,720
It's just...

2474
02:57:35,720 --> 02:57:37,180
Oh, God, it just really...

2475
02:57:37,180 --> 02:57:39,080
It just really hits in a good way.

2476
02:57:39,220 --> 02:57:39,560
Hold on.

2477
02:57:40,040 --> 02:57:40,920
Turn it up some.

02:58:52,180 --> 02:59:01,480
seen so just for you in the Stanley Parable 2 I'm including
an entirely new setting Something called bump scossity.

2488
02:59:01,540 --> 02:59:02,420
Bump scossity?

2489
02:59:02,420 --> 02:59:04,320
What exactly is bump scossity?

2490
02:59:04,540 --> 02:59:11,300
Well, I haven't quite figured that part out yet, but I just
know that you'll be able to adjust it on some sort of

2491
02:59:11,300 --> 02:59:11,920
slider.

2492
02:59:12,720 --> 02:59:13,260

possible numbers.

2509
03:00:01,390 --> 03:00:03,150

2516
03:00:22,530 --> 03:00:23,170
Bump...

2517
03:00:23,170 --> 03:00:23,750
I haven't...

2518
03:00:30,350 --> 03:00:31,590
Didn't do anything!

2519
03:00:39,290 --> 03:00:41,150
Adjust the bump viscosity.

2520
03:00:43,850 --> 03:00:46,770
It's probably so big that it, like, uh...

2521
03:00:46,770 --> 03:00:48,250
That it, like, looped around.

2522
03:00:48,450 --> 03:00:49,010
know what I'm saying.

2523
03:00:50,150 --> 03:00:50,870
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2524
03:00:51,150 --> 03:00:51,690
Oh my god.

2525
03:00:51,890 --> 03:00:52,310
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2526
03:00:52,310 --> 03:00:52,790
I'm feeling it.

2527
03:00:52,890 --> 03:00:53,490
I'm feeling it.

2528
03:00:53,950 --> 03:00:54,970
Oh, oh my god.

2529
03:00:55,170 --> 03:00:55,530
Whoa, whoa.

2530
03:00:55,610 --> 03:00:55,910
Hold on.

2531
03:00:55,950 --> 03:00:58,710
I have to... Okay, I know this is like a new feature.

2532
03:01:00,470 --> 03:01:06,010
So it's probably like, you know, not exactly like... Okay,
that's so much more manageable.

2533
03:01:07,210 --> 03:01:09,090
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2534
03:01:09,250 --> 03:01:09,970
Try bump is up.

2535
03:01:10,130 --> 03:01:10,530
Whoa.

2536
03:01:11,890 --> 03:01:12,290
Whoa.

2537
03:01:13,030 --> 03:01:13,430
Bumps.

2538
03:01:14,390 --> 03:01:14,790
Cassidy.

2539
03:01:18,450 --> 03:01:24,550
had to really yeah it was like a really really intense i
shouldn't have i should have just worked i think this is a

2540
03:01:24,550 --> 03:01:31,950
type of setting that like not everyone can handle like i can
handle it because you know i'm like better than you but i

2541
03:01:31,950 --> 03:01:41,890
don't think anybody else it's like it takes a really really
really like high iq like really really like specific type of

2542
03:01:41,890 --> 03:01:47,990
like awesome person to be able to handle it you know what
i'm saying so like if you're playing this and you get and

2543
03:01:47,990 --> 03:01:54,950
you i don't think I don't expect you guys to get the bump
scossity you know um like a slider because it's like pretty

2544
03:01:54,950 --> 03:02:01,130
it's like only real like gamers can get it and also I don't
really know if you guys are capable of doing that but if you

2545
03:02:01,130 --> 03:02:10,030
do if you just happen to get lucky and like maybe like
accidentally stumble upon it um you know I would recommend

2546
03:02:10,030 --> 03:02:17,710
maybe you start at like a one um and then just kind of like
work your way up because for me I can go from like a

2547
03:02:17,710 --> 03:02:25,750
thousand and like it's a little hard to adjust but like I'm
fine for you I think you might actually be crushed into like

2548
03:02:25,750 --> 03:02:34,030
into like little tiny your little tiny brain would be like
you know what I mean so just don't don't worry about it mint

2549
03:02:34,030 --> 03:02:50,390
is better than me confirmed no epilogue oh oh an epilogue
would be fun Why are you guys clowning me?

2550
03:02:50,390 --> 03:02:51,450
Well, we'll figure that out later.

2551
03:02:55,220 --> 03:02:55,800
That's it.

2552
03:02:55,880 --> 03:02:57,500
That's all the epilogue was for?

2553
03:02:59,700 --> 03:03:00,760
Taste the sequel.

2554
03:03:02,080 --> 03:03:02,820
That was it.

2555
03:03:05,160 --> 03:03:05,660
Two!

2556
03:03:06,320 --> 03:03:07,100

2557
03:03:12,150 --> 03:03:12,550
Okay.

03:03:16,550 --> 03:03:17,390
Okie dokie.

2559
03:03:17,510 --> 03:03:18,390
I think that's the exit.

2560
03:03:19,110 --> 03:03:19,770
Do you guys...

2561
03:03:20,090 --> 03:03:20,530

2562
03:03:20,750 --> 03:03:21,350

I'll go do the QR code.

2577

03:06:55,850 --> 03:06:56,570
Oh, and my jumps.

2579

Oh, shoot.

03:08:40,650 --> 03:08:42,290

2611
03:08:42,990 --> 03:08:44,090
Wait, open an app.

2612
03:08:44,250 --> 03:08:44,730

Okay, okay, okay.

2614
03:08:47,090 --> 03:08:48,390

2616
03:08:50,810 --> 03:08:51,710

Window capture.

2623
03:09:09,070 --> 03:09:09,290

2624
03:09:10,610 --> 03:09:12,230
Crop, crop, crop, crop, crop.

2625
03:09:13,170 --> 03:09:14,730
Crop, crop, crop, crop.

2626
03:09:15,990 --> 03:09:17,790

crop okay da-da-da-dokie-dokie all right watch along

2628
03:09:32,220 --> 03:09:41,100
say there Timmy what's that you're enjoying why it's
breakfast of course everyone breakfast of champions but did

2629
03:09:41,100 --> 03:09:48,360
you know that breakfast is getting a sequel that's right
it's called lunch and critics are raving that lunch will be

2630
03:09:48,360 --> 03:09:56,180
everything breakfast was and more with a little luck we may
even get a trilogy series out of it why you know what a

2631
03:09:56,180 --> 03:10:03,640
sequel is don't you Timmy why is it Timmy responding way of
clinging helplessly to the past we all want more of the

2632
03:10:03,640 --> 03:10:11,760
things we love and we're all afraid of change which is what
makes sequels so popular new ideas are dangerous to me and

2633
03:10:11,760 --> 03:10:18,800
they can lead to early so true oh this eager-minded young
thinker is just 29 years old that's why I don't want to look

2634
03:10:18,800 --> 03:10:25,120
like that to keep us couched in the familiar I need to stop
thinking right now good thing I never thought of a healthy

2635
03:10:25,120 --> 03:10:32,440
functional society and if you look around you you'll find
them everywhere you go for instance this man is developing a

2636
03:10:32,440 --> 03:10:41,500
sequel to the automobile i don't know the vertical
automobile whoa how long is this and wait this is 10 minutes

2637
03:10:41,500 --> 03:10:51,420
you guys wait this is so long not all sequels are heretical
nonsense however here's the man who invented which is the

2638
03:10:51,420 --> 03:10:54,340
sequel to suffocating and dying a slow death.

2639
03:10:55,120 --> 03:10:57,100
Even your parents are getting a sequel, Timmy.

2640
03:10:57,460 --> 03:11:04,100
Their names are Rob and Jessica, and they'll be taking care
of you once your original parents are sent back in time to

2641
03:11:04,100 --> 03:11:06,060
fight a secret war for the government.

2642
03:11:07,020 --> 03:11:08,640
Sequels can be very fashionable.

2643
03:11:09,080 --> 03:11:14,980
This young woman is wearing five shirts at once, which is
the sequel to wearing four shirts at once.

2644
03:11:15,460 --> 03:11:15,460
Wow.

2645
03:11:15,720 --> 03:11:17,160
Look at Becky over there.

2646
03:11:17,480 --> 03:11:19,200
Wearing only two shirts at once.

2647
03:11:19,460 --> 03:11:20,600
Get with the times, Becky.

2648
03:11:20,780 --> 03:11:22,220
Get with the times, Becky.

2649
03:11:22,700 --> 03:11:25,260
one single thing in the world that isn't a sequel.

2650
03:11:25,800 --> 03:11:26,320
It's this.

2651
03:11:26,760 --> 03:11:33,360
We don't know what it is or why it exists, but it's the
prequel from which all sequels are derived.

2652
03:11:34,120 --> 03:11:38,140
And just like everything else, the Stanley Parable is
getting a sequel too.

2653
03:11:38,160 --> 03:11:38,620
You know what?

2654
03:11:38,660 --> 03:11:39,720
I'll be honest.

2655
03:11:40,060 --> 03:11:42,340
I'll be honest.

2656
03:11:42,340 --> 03:11:44,660
I don't know if it's actually getting a sequel.

2657
03:11:46,380 --> 03:11:50,240
Is it actually getting a sequel?

2658
03:11:50,680 --> 03:11:52,600
I can't tell anymore.

2659
03:11:52,700 --> 03:11:59,300
way or another and you were fortunate enough to get to waste
yours on the stanley parable it doesn't have enough of the

2660
03:11:59,300 --> 03:12:07,160
transatlantic accent you know what i mean to match the man
which is like the vibes of this child oh it isn't okay man

2661
03:12:07,160 --> 03:12:12,540
you want manly things like taxes and cheating at baseball
this is the sequel you're right you're right man's video

2662
03:12:12,540 --> 03:12:19,410
game timmy yeah timmy and that's why the stanley parable 2
will be perfect for you it's as manly as

2663
03:12:22,700 --> 03:12:27,020
Let's look at the burly hunk of a man who's responsible for
the game.

2664
03:12:27,200 --> 03:12:29,200
Huh, here he is, hard at work.

2665
03:12:29,280 --> 03:12:29,600
Really?

2666
03:12:29,840 --> 03:12:31,600
His name is Gregory Apec.

2667
03:12:31,680 --> 03:12:34,600
And he's the cutting picture of royal masculinity.

2668
03:12:35,900 --> 03:12:38,180
Gregory is what we call the Ideas Guy.

2669
03:12:38,680 --> 03:12:41,240
And he has the most important role on the team.

2670
03:12:41,980 --> 03:12:45,700
The Ideas Guy tirelessly comes up with interesting concepts.

2671
03:12:46,040 --> 03:12:51,400
And then hands them off to the rest of the developers for
the relatively simple job of turning those concepts into

2672
03:12:51,400 --> 03:12:51,400
reality.

2673
03:12:52,880 --> 03:12:58,720
for example i don't know i can't i don't know how to do
anything someone ought to make a sequel to the stanley

2674
03:12:58,720 --> 03:13:06,720
parable good work gregory go ahead and take the rest of the
day off with the hard part out of the way work on the game

2675
03:13:06,720 --> 03:13:13,000
can now begin stanley parable 2 is coming out soon just a
month after minecraft 2 what makes a sequel in the first

2676
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:20,560
place when it's simple sequels are an opportunity to correct
the mistakes of their predecessors we've all made mistakes

2677
03:13:20,560 --> 03:13:28,160
and we've all caused harm to someone we love in order to
cover up our mistakes when developing this particular sequel

2678
03:13:28,160 --> 03:13:35,800
it's important to start by thinking what mistakes did the
original Stanley Parable make well first off most of the

2679
03:13:35,800 --> 03:13:44,200
pornography in the original game stolen or pirated and it's
time we paid the licensing fees fair and square second the

2680
03:13:44,200 --> 03:13:51,180
Stanley Parable was catastrophic for this man named Levi
whose personal information including home address, social

2681
03:13:51,180 --> 03:13:57,820
security number and bank information were all displayed
prominently in multiple locations throughout the game.

2682
03:13:58,220 --> 03:14:05,320
Although Leroy's money and identity were stolen, the fact
remains that his personal information was the emotional core

2683
03:14:05,320 --> 03:14:06,080
of the game.

2684
03:14:06,420 --> 03:14:09,960
And absolutely vital to a nuanced understanding of the
story.

2685
03:14:10,800 --> 03:14:11,680
Leroy dogs.

2686
03:14:12,360 --> 03:14:19,700
The sequel will contain a brief and insincere apology to
Leroy, took deep within the game, where it will be difficult

2687
03:14:19,700 --> 03:14:20,340
to find.

2688
03:14:21,060 --> 03:14:27,340
Finally, the Stanley Parable made the mistake of leaking too
many government secrets about the nature of the Time Wars.

2689
03:14:27,580 --> 03:14:28,540
The Time Wars?

2690
03:14:29,040 --> 03:14:33,780
Details of specific military tactics, the story is likely to
make very little sense.

2691
03:14:33,860 --> 03:14:34,860
There's war in this game?

2692
03:14:34,880 --> 03:14:38,720
We decided to remove them from the sequel in the interest of
helping the state's efforts.

2693
03:14:39,260 --> 03:14:41,120
We'll get to you yet, time Dracula.

2694
03:14:41,500 --> 03:14:42,020
Dracula?

2695
03:14:42,720 --> 03:14:45,820
It's time to set about constructing the Stanley Parable 2.

2696
03:14:46,580 --> 03:14:53,280
Game development is a difficult and complex art one which
can only be fully understood by this race of hyper

2697
03:14:53,280 --> 03:15:07,280
intelligent child soldiers the children soldiers yippee oh
my god they're eating gunpowder time to exploit it for

2698
03:15:07,280 --> 03:15:15,360
profit let's go the stanley parable was most widely known
for its stark lack of humor bucking all conventional

2699
03:15:15,360 --> 03:15:24,440
industry wisdom it was a bold artist that its developers
stood firmly behind but in 2022 it's impossible to reach

2700
03:15:24,440 --> 03:15:33,260
even a single consumer of video games without jokes of some
kind so very well jokes it'll be whoa we're getting jokes oh

2701
03:15:33,260 --> 03:15:39,160
my youtube bro hold on you guys of comedy will be following
directly into the core of the stanley parable i can't reach

2702
03:15:39,160 --> 03:15:46,320
out i'm sorry jobs for hundreds of machine operators and
producing 30 000 tons of pollutant chemical byproduct which

2703
03:15:46,320 --> 03:15:52,380
will be pumped directly into local lakes and beautiful
nature reserves like these all over the country.

2704
03:15:52,400 --> 03:15:54,100
Oh, screw the environment!

2705
03:15:54,120 --> 03:15:57,380
Another common complaint of the Stanley Parable is that
there wasn't enough gameplay.

2706
03:15:57,880 --> 03:16:02,380
And so for the sequel, its developers have gone to great
lengths to fix this problem.

2707
03:16:02,920 --> 03:16:05,480
Here we can see gameplay being printed on the sheets.

2708
03:16:05,980 --> 03:16:09,780
Every video game contains as many as a thousand sheets of
gameplay.

2709
03:16:10,360 --> 03:16:11,240
That's a lot of gameplay.

2710
03:16:11,520 --> 03:16:14,120
The largest games ever made contain close to 1500.

2711
03:16:14,440 --> 03:16:18,300
On mobile devices, the gameplay sheets have to be printed
smaller.

2712
03:16:18,580 --> 03:16:23,560
For the Stanley Parable 2, as many as 35 new gameplay sheets
are being printed.

2713
03:16:24,120 --> 03:16:29,980
Each of which must be delicately massaged by the hands of a
child before being added into the game.

2714
03:16:30,720 --> 03:16:37,060
This man is stealing gameplay sheets from the factory, which
he likely intended to use as a personal project he's been

2715
03:16:37,060 --> 03:16:38,840
developing in his spare time.

2716
03:16:39,160 --> 03:16:42,060
A good public stoning will cure him of that inclination.

2717
03:16:42,820 --> 03:16:42,960
Stoning?

2718
03:16:43,180 --> 03:16:45,120
Let's check on Gregory real quick.

2719
03:16:45,120 --> 03:16:45,560
Ha!

2720
03:16:46,060 --> 03:16:48,180
Still recovering from a hard day's work.

2721
03:16:48,540 --> 03:16:49,640
Don't you move a muscle.

2722
03:16:50,120 --> 03:16:51,340
Good job, Gregory.

2723
03:16:51,380 --> 03:16:53,260
It's time to blackmail the press.

2724
03:16:53,760 --> 03:16:59,740
In a competitive market, blackmailing your local journalist
can be one of the most effective methods of creating

2725
03:16:59,740 --> 03:17:01,760
word-of-mouth buzz for your sequel.

2726
03:17:01,940 --> 03:17:05,640
In fact, blackmail is the currency of social progress.

2727
03:17:06,220 --> 03:17:12,940
From your neighborhood grocer to the teacher at your school
to the man who helps you steal HBO, everyone responds to

2728
03:17:12,940 --> 03:17:13,520
blackmail.

2729
03:17:15,120 --> 03:17:18,820
before, it's easy to practice at home on your friends and
family.

2730
03:17:19,500 --> 03:17:23,920
Simply follow the instructional pamphlet that your teacher
hands out after the end of the film.

2731
03:17:24,940 --> 03:17:30,520
And finally, there's one last tool at our disposal for
making the sequel feel fresh and exciting.

2732
03:17:30,940 --> 03:17:34,360
And that's packaging the game with collector's edition
merchandise.

2733
03:17:35,120 --> 03:17:39,440
If you order the Stanley Parable 2, you'll receive this
cow's egg.

2734
03:17:39,940 --> 03:17:47,200
A single egg will produce over a thousand cows, which are,
of course, the sequel to pigs and there you have it

2735
03:17:47,200 --> 03:17:54,140
everything there is to know about producing the stanley
parable too of course you may know that there is also a game

2736
03:17:54,140 --> 03:18:02,800
titled the stanley parable ultra deluxe so which game is the
true sequel to the stanley parable looks so confused oh

2737
03:18:02,800 --> 03:18:09,060
sorry billy one which the child soldiers have been working
around the clock to come up with an answer to come on more

2738
03:18:09,060 --> 03:18:17,880
gunpowder research the conclusion they've reached is who
gives a matters is that it's more content for you to cram

2739
03:18:17,880 --> 03:18:24,700
down your insatiable gullet you don't want thoughtful i'm
eating all this content i'm eating all this content you just

2740
03:18:24,700 --> 03:18:32,120

cheat at hopscotch do your civic duty and bully your parents

every platform i already do that with metal gear song their

metal gear harmony and connection.

2743
03:18:47,600 --> 03:18:52,940
And it's only through this connection that we'll defeat Time
Dracula once and for all.

2744
03:18:53,680 --> 03:18:56,220
Don't let the time-traveling vampires win.

2745
03:18:56,700 --> 03:19:01,320
Buy the Stanley Parable 2 and pledge to support all sequels.

2746
03:19:01,860 --> 03:19:06,540
For today, tomorrow, and into the great unknowable beyond.

2747
03:19:09,960 --> 03:19:10,760
The end.

2748
03:19:11,420 --> 03:19:11,840
Nice.

2749
03:19:19,060 --> 03:19:20,620
Well, that was Fun.

2750
03:19:20,800 --> 03:19:21,440
Oh, wait!

2751
03:19:24,020 --> 03:19:25,280
Hold on.

2752
03:19:26,640 --> 03:19:27,880
There was one more thing.

2753
03:19:28,900 --> 03:19:31,300
There was one more thing at the very end.

2754
03:19:34,860 --> 03:19:36,240
Oh, no!

2755
03:19:38,670 --> 03:19:39,470
One second.

2756
03:19:40,710 --> 03:19:41,330
One second.

2768
03:21:24,300 --> 03:21:34,320
my soul it's going to work somewhere say let's do an
experiment okay i'll arrange these new features together and

03:22:15,400 --> 03:22:22,600
who am i kidding stanley the jump circle wow this isn't a
coherent video game at all it's a lot of gags and i do very

2774
03:22:22,600 --> 03:22:30,260
much enjoy creating gags but they don't add up to anything i
wanted more than anything to create a sequel that would

2775
03:22:30,260 --> 03:22:36,840
capture all the magic of the first game i wanted fans to
love it no matter how good these gags are they wouldn't

2776
03:22:36,840 --> 03:22:44,920
stand on their own they would need the structure in the
gameplay of the original wait maybe that's it i can take the

2777
03:22:44,920 --> 03:22:53,620
original stanley parable and simply well insert a few of my
new features into it tastefully of course of course Ladies

2778
03:22:53,620 --> 03:22:54,260
and gentlemen, welcome back.

2779
03:22:54,500 --> 03:22:54,700
Thank you.

2780
03:22:55,060 --> 03:22:55,500
Thank you.

2781
03:22:57,440 --> 03:22:58,560
Would it possibly work?

2782
03:22:58,580 --> 03:23:00,180
Why can't it be so sad in there?

2783
03:23:00,380 --> 03:23:03,660
But it would need a really, really tremendous title screen.

2784
03:23:04,280 --> 03:23:11,900
A title screen that says with bold and uncompromising
conviction, this is the Stanley Parable Tool.

2785
03:23:12,900 --> 03:23:13,100
Okay.

2786
03:23:14,160 --> 03:23:15,740
Okay, I'm excited.

2787
03:23:16,200 --> 03:23:17,060
Alright, perfect.

2788
03:23:17,560 --> 03:23:18,240
Go ahead.

2789
03:23:18,660 --> 03:23:19,700
I'm closing my eyes.

2790
03:23:22,560 --> 03:23:22,840
Oh!

2791
03:23:25,380 --> 03:23:26,640
The Stanley... Oh!

2792
03:23:27,780 --> 03:23:28,380
PT?

2793
03:23:29,820 --> 03:23:32,400
The Stanley Parable 2.

2794
03:23:35,180 --> 03:23:35,700
Wow!

2795
03:23:39,060 --> 03:23:40,880
It's kinda creepy!

2796
03:23:41,980 --> 03:23:42,960
Quit the desktop!

2797
03:23:44,520 --> 03:23:48,560
I guess we gotta begin the game, you guys.

2798
03:23:55,080 --> 03:23:55,740
Click to skip.

2799
03:23:55,760 --> 03:23:57,960
This is the story of a man named Stanley.

2800
03:24:00,860 --> 03:24:03,740
Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he
was...

2801
03:24:03,740 --> 03:24:04,180
I decorated it!

2802
03:24:04,720 --> 03:24:05,920
Four, two, seven.

2803
03:24:06,020 --> 03:24:06,920
Four, two, seven.

2804
03:24:07,420 --> 03:24:08,460
Four, two, seven.

2805
03:24:08,820 --> 03:24:09,680
His job was simple.

2806
03:24:10,200 --> 03:24:14,920
He sat at his desk in room four, two, seven, and he pushed
buttons on a keyboard.

2807
03:24:17,420 --> 03:24:17,820
Oh my gosh.

2808
03:24:18,000 --> 03:24:18,180
Wait.

2809
03:24:18,380 --> 03:24:18,880
Our bucket?

2810
03:24:19,020 --> 03:24:19,500
Where's the bucket?

2811
03:24:20,200 --> 03:24:21,660
How long to push them?

2812
03:24:22,100 --> 03:24:22,880
And in what order?

2813
03:24:22,920 --> 03:24:24,360
Yeah, we got the balloons and everything.

2814
03:24:25,080 --> 03:24:26,340
There he goes.

2815
03:24:26,700 --> 03:24:30,220
Every day of every month of every year.

2816
03:24:30,840 --> 03:24:37,040
Although others might have considered it sorely, Stanley
relished every moment that the boys came in.

2817
03:24:37,100 --> 03:24:40,340
But so he had been made exactly for this job.

2818
03:24:41,440 --> 03:24:43,340
And Stanley was happy.

2819
03:24:43,380 --> 03:24:44,500
He was happy.

2820
03:24:46,400 --> 03:24:49,260
And then one day something very peculiar happened.

2821
03:24:49,840 --> 03:24:52,260
Something that would forever change Stanley.

2822
03:24:52,780 --> 03:24:54,680
Something he would never quite forget.

2823
03:24:55,080 --> 03:24:57,860
Two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two.

2824
03:24:58,160 --> 03:25:03,900
When he realized that not one single order had arrived on
the monitor for him to follow.

2825
03:25:04,500 --> 03:25:06,060
No one showed up to give him instructions.

2826
03:25:06,860 --> 03:25:08,320
No, I wanted the other balloon.

2827
03:25:09,760 --> 03:25:11,260
I wanted the other ones.

2828
03:25:11,340 --> 03:25:13,760
Never in all his years at the company had this happened.

2829
03:25:14,100 --> 03:25:15,960
This complete isolation.

2830
03:25:16,760 --> 03:25:18,740
Something was very clearly wrong.

2831
03:25:19,400 --> 03:25:25,000
Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move
for the longest time.

2832
03:25:25,080 --> 03:25:31,800
But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got
up from his desk and stepped out of his office.

2833
03:25:32,140 --> 03:25:33,720
I hope you get well eventually, babe.

2834
03:25:34,780 --> 03:25:36,420
Happy 12th birthday, babe.

2835
03:25:38,020 --> 03:25:43,660
I like how you guys both said the opposite things at the
same time.

2836
03:25:44,460 --> 03:25:45,720
Okay, here we go, I guess.

2837
03:25:46,940 --> 03:25:48,640
All of his co-workers were gone.

2838
03:25:48,840 --> 03:25:49,920
What could it mean?

2839
03:25:50,580 --> 03:25:52,320
Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.

2840
03:25:52,360 --> 03:25:53,380
Even on the lamps.

2841
03:25:53,880 --> 03:25:54,140
Maybe he'd simply missed a memo.

2842
03:25:55,180 --> 03:25:55,940
Woo!

2843
03:25:56,140 --> 03:25:58,280
Happy 12th birthday, Stepanese!

2844
03:25:59,240 --> 03:26:00,980
My favorite Stepanese in the world.

2845
03:26:03,020 --> 03:26:06,400
Stanley picked up the bucket.

2846
03:26:06,540 --> 03:26:06,760
Oh!

2847
03:26:10,440 --> 03:26:11,200
Woo!

2848
03:26:14,960 --> 03:26:16,520
We got a bucket.

2849
03:26:18,640 --> 03:26:23,160
Stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his chest and entered
the door on his left.

2850
03:26:26,580 --> 03:26:27,840
Well, what if I don't?

2851
03:26:29,440 --> 03:26:30,880
I mean, I know I like the bucket.

2852
03:26:32,920 --> 03:26:36,160
I know the bucket, like, gives me that...

2853
03:26:45,240 --> 03:26:45,800
That...

2854
03:26:45,800 --> 03:26:47,300
What should I do, bucket?

2855
03:26:47,440 --> 03:26:48,180
What should I do?

2856
03:26:50,300 --> 03:26:50,860
Okay.

2857
03:26:51,600 --> 03:26:53,880
This was not the correct way to the meeting room.

2858
03:26:54,360 --> 03:27:00,760
But Stanley had felt the bucket calling to him, telling him
that the employee lounge was simply the place to be.

2859
03:27:00,940 --> 03:27:02,860
Simply the place to be.

2860
03:27:02,880 --> 03:27:03,640
Here it was.

2861
03:27:03,960 --> 03:27:05,500
Had the bucket turned out to be correct?

2862
03:27:05,960 --> 03:27:07,380
Was this better than the meeting room?

2863
03:27:07,880 --> 03:27:09,360
Yes, Stanley thought to himself.

2864
03:27:09,740 --> 03:27:10,980
Yes, perhaps it truly was.

2865
03:27:11,200 --> 03:27:11,580
Perhaps it truly was.

2866
03:27:11,580 --> 03:27:13,820
How insightful the bucket turned out to be.

2867
03:27:13,820 --> 03:27:15,980
My God, everything is redoubbed with the bucket.

2868
03:27:19,360 --> 03:27:20,620
The bucket's so awesome.

2869
03:27:21,820 --> 03:27:22,780
The bucket was wrong.

2870
03:27:22,900 --> 03:27:23,380
Never.

2871
03:27:23,800 --> 03:27:24,160
Not at all.

2872
03:27:24,160 --> 03:27:27,060
Stanley took the door on his left to go back to the meeting
room.

2873
03:27:27,340 --> 03:27:28,740
What does this way go to?

2874
03:27:28,820 --> 03:27:32,520
Oh, this one is, uh, yeah, where I fell before.

2875
03:27:33,460 --> 03:27:45,560
what was this way again oh and this way oh we went
downstairs okay yeah the bucket's never wrong kind of want

2876
03:27:45,560 --> 03:27:54,000
to ride it though no said the bucket no don't go to the
meeting room go somewhere else a cargo lift yes go there go

2877
03:27:54,000 --> 03:27:59,360

room

2878
03:28:02,880 --> 03:28:08,540
ride the lift all the way to the top oh there's something up
there i need you to do oh my god there's even a balloon at

2879
03:28:08,540 --> 03:28:14,920
the top why or how this bucket was speaking to him it should
have alarmed him of course because buckets can't talk but

2880
03:28:14,920 --> 03:28:19,900
stanley chose not to think about this obvious we're gonna go
we're gonna go he was only convinced that the bucket had

2881
03:28:19,900 --> 03:28:32,460
spoken to him and he unthinkingly did whatever the bucket
asked okay sounds good no in here said the bucket go into

2882
03:28:32,460 --> 03:28:41,740
this dark room over here over here stanley once again obeyed
blindly this room's not very dark this room's pretty bright

2883
03:28:41,740 --> 03:28:51,560
actually oh oh oh oh are you sure bucket oh okay

2884
03:28:56,940 --> 03:28:58,620
up the phone, said the bucket.

2885
03:28:58,960 --> 03:29:03,520
Pick up the phone, and it will take us back home, where we
can go about life together.

2886
03:29:03,860 --> 03:29:04,180
Really?

2887
03:29:05,940 --> 03:29:07,920
Thanks for the five gifts I didn't do.

2888
03:29:08,040 --> 03:29:09,100
Oh, customer buy, thank you!

2889
03:29:09,360 --> 03:29:13,280
This is the sad story of a man named Stanley and his bucket.

2890
03:29:13,360 --> 03:29:14,000
Where's my bucket?

2891
03:29:14,140 --> 03:29:19,080
Once upon a time, I gave Stanley a bucket because I thought
he was lonely and could use a friend.

2892
03:29:19,780 --> 03:29:23,760
And then, very distressingly, he began to believe the bucket
could speak to him.

2893
03:29:25,500 --> 03:29:26,840
Is this my house?

2894
03:29:27,500 --> 03:29:32,060
Oh my god, Stanley lives in an Ikea, like, uh, setup.

2895
03:29:33,320 --> 03:29:33,760
There's the bucket.

2896
03:29:34,900 --> 03:29:35,740
Hello, Stanley, it's me.

2897
03:29:35,880 --> 03:29:38,100
Oh, hello, Stanley, it's me, your bucket.

2898
03:29:38,420 --> 03:29:40,940
Press you to take me to walk with you.

2899
03:29:42,660 --> 03:29:43,080
Oh.

2900
03:29:43,380 --> 03:29:48,020
The Stanley Parable Reassurance Bucket was merely meant to
provide the comforting glow of companionship.

2901
03:29:48,020 --> 03:29:49,240
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for that fence again.

2902
03:29:49,240 --> 03:29:51,500
It doesn't literally talk and give you orders.

2903
03:29:52,340 --> 03:29:55,640
Whatever Stanley is hearing the bucket say to him is just in
his head.

2904
03:29:55,700 --> 03:29:56,380
Oh, here it is.

2905
03:29:58,600 --> 03:30:01,220
Press O to take me back home with you.

2906
03:30:07,660 --> 03:30:13,240
Where's my bucket?

2907
03:30:13,760 --> 03:30:15,520
I don't know how I can convince him.

2908
03:30:15,580 --> 03:30:17,400
I don't know if he'll listen to me.

2909
03:30:17,640 --> 03:30:18,620
Thought I lost him for a second.

2910
03:30:20,160 --> 03:30:22,280
Press G to go back to whack.

2911
03:30:23,540 --> 03:30:25,820
Well, I'll try anyway.

2912
03:30:27,100 --> 03:30:34,300

bucket it can't think bucket bucket where are you oh thank

2913
03:30:34,300 --> 03:30:40,640

transfer a liquid from one location I don't hear anybody

2914
03:30:40,640 --> 03:30:50,520
else I only hear the bucket it doesn't do anything else
don't listen to the loud man press R for us to go back home

2915
03:30:50,520 --> 03:30:57,480
oh you see he's not listening he's still taking orders from
Bucket!

2916
03:30:59,180 --> 03:30:59,520
Bucket!

2917
03:30:59,900 --> 03:31:00,420
Where are you, Bucket!

2918
03:31:00,440 --> 03:31:00,780
Where are you, Bucket?

2919
03:31:01,260 --> 03:31:03,080
Now all he cares about is his awful bucket.

2920
03:31:03,080 --> 03:31:03,660
Where's the bucket?

2921
03:31:03,900 --> 03:31:04,440
Where's the bucket?

2922
03:31:04,860 --> 03:31:05,860
Where's the bucket?

2923
03:31:06,120 --> 03:31:06,540
Where's the bucket?

2924
03:31:06,780 --> 03:31:07,300
Where's the bucket?

2925
03:31:08,700 --> 03:31:09,180
Where's my bucket?

2926
03:31:09,180 --> 03:31:10,000
Where's my bucket?

2927
03:31:10,460 --> 03:31:10,860
Narrator.

2928
03:31:11,080 --> 03:31:11,300
Oh, here.

2929
03:31:12,700 --> 03:31:16,140
Press O to ignore anyone in your life except for me.

2930
03:31:19,040 --> 03:31:19,760
Well, guys.

2931
03:31:24,100 --> 03:31:26,920
Press O to ignore anyone in your life except for me.

2932
03:31:35,450 --> 03:31:36,750
It's a lot of those.

2933
03:31:37,610 --> 03:31:38,450
Thank you.

2934
03:31:40,110 --> 03:31:40,790
It's sad.

2935
03:31:41,330 --> 03:31:42,890
I suppose he doesn't need me anymore.

2936
03:31:43,690 --> 03:31:50,870
From now on, he's just going to cling to this bucket, this
cold, empty bucket, this sort of shiny bucket.

2937
03:31:52,070 --> 03:31:52,890
Well, I'll give it this.

2938
03:31:53,010 --> 03:31:54,750
The bucket does have a nice shine to it.

2939
03:31:54,770 --> 03:31:55,290
Yeah, it does.

2940
03:31:56,710 --> 03:31:59,210
You believe I'm real, don't you, Stanley?

2941
03:31:59,710 --> 03:32:01,370
Press H to go back home.

2942
03:32:03,370 --> 03:32:09,410
Yes, I suppose on closer inspection that it doesn't quite
look like your average hardware store bucket.

2943
03:32:10,030 --> 03:32:12,670
It's just a little more, um, what am I trying to say?

2944
03:32:13,410 --> 03:32:16,530
Sturdier, more capable of transporting liquid.

2945
03:32:16,830 --> 03:32:17,370
Yeah, I see.

2946
03:32:17,370 --> 03:32:21,050
Like it would be better at moving an amount of water from
one room to another.

2947
03:32:23,390 --> 03:32:26,690
Press R to relive the same day with me over and over.

2948
03:32:30,560 --> 03:32:32,540
Oh my God, what am I saying?

2949
03:32:33,620 --> 03:32:35,760
a carrying water from room to room.

2950
03:32:35,920 --> 03:32:36,480
It's a bucket.

2951
03:32:36,880 --> 03:32:38,500
It's literally just a bucket.

2952
03:32:39,520 --> 03:32:45,040
Why do I feel some need to point out the ways in which it's
so much more than just a regular bucket?

2953
03:32:47,360 --> 03:32:51,080
Press I to go home to work to home to work to home.

2954
03:32:53,360 --> 03:32:53,940
Oh, no.

2955
03:32:54,260 --> 03:32:57,640
I'm having feelings for the bucket.

2956
03:32:58,120 --> 03:32:59,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2957
03:32:59,680 --> 03:33:00,280
What's going on?

2958
03:33:00,280 --> 03:33:01,920
Why do I want to be with the bucket?

2959
03:33:02,500 --> 03:33:03,880
Hear what the bucket has to say.

2960
03:33:04,120 --> 03:33:05,160
Do anything it asks.

2961
03:33:05,420 --> 03:33:06,180
What's wrong with me?

2962
03:33:06,340 --> 03:33:07,160
I don't understand.

2963
03:33:07,920 --> 03:33:10,760
Perhaps if I had the bucket, this would be less confusing.

2964
03:33:11,200 --> 03:33:11,320
Yes.

2965
03:33:11,980 --> 03:33:15,380
The bucket could tell me what to do in this troublesome
situation.

2966
03:33:16,420 --> 03:33:18,560
Is the bucket waiting for me on the bed?

2967
03:33:20,320 --> 03:33:21,280
The bucket.

2968
03:33:21,680 --> 03:33:24,700
I mean, this is so nice.

2969
03:33:24,900 --> 03:33:34,260
I didn't, I didn't, you know, I thought you would be too
tired after such a long day but you even even despite that

2970
03:33:34,260 --> 03:33:50,360
you put all of this together for me bucket i mean wow it's
just so beautiful it's just no bucket no bucket Stanley give

2971
03:33:50,360 --> 03:33:59,120

close your eyes go

2972
03:34:02,880 --> 03:34:04,520
back to work step Stanley.

2973
03:34:05,340 --> 03:34:07,560
Go back to work, Stanley.

2974
03:34:14,780 --> 03:34:15,140
Bucket?

2975
03:34:18,500 --> 03:34:19,060
Bucket?

2976
03:34:21,100 --> 03:34:23,540
All of his co-workers were gone.

2977
03:34:24,020 --> 03:34:24,920
What could it mean?

2978
03:34:25,260 --> 03:34:25,800
Bucket!

2979
03:34:25,880 --> 03:34:27,340
Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.

2980
03:34:27,560 --> 03:34:29,160
Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.

2981
03:34:29,800 --> 03:34:31,780
Stanley lifted the bucket into his arms.

2982
03:34:32,040 --> 03:34:32,220
Ooh!

2983
03:34:32,220 --> 03:34:34,500
And a wave of comfort rushed over him.

2984
03:34:35,260 --> 03:34:37,200
Minch Phantom, parasocial for a bucket.

2985
03:34:37,520 --> 03:34:38,560
Trust the bucket, believe in the bucket.

2986
03:34:38,580 --> 03:34:53,780
bucket that was such a fun ending that was so funny i love
that oh wait oh it got the second input how's that in there

2987
03:34:53,780 --> 03:35:04,300

time i don't go i wish there was a way oh the sequel is now

2988
03:35:04,300 --> 03:35:12,060
paused wait this is so crazy um I wish there was a way to
know how many endings you had left, you know what I mean?

2989
03:35:13,060 --> 03:35:13,860
That ending was fantastic.

2990
03:35:14,020 --> 03:35:15,900
I think that was a good one to end on, I think.

2991
03:35:17,100 --> 03:35:18,340
I think so.

2992
03:35:20,280 --> 03:35:21,780
Send the bucket to space.

2993
03:35:23,520 --> 03:35:23,880
Achievement.

2994
03:35:23,940 --> 03:35:25,720
Oh, I guess an achievement, yeah, probably.

2995
03:35:25,860 --> 03:35:26,260
Let me see.

2996
03:35:27,320 --> 03:35:29,780
Oh, I've unlocked only 4 out of 11?

2997
03:35:30,120 --> 03:35:31,520
Wait, view my achievements.

2998
03:35:33,380 --> 03:35:34,960
Quit the game and start it again.

2999
03:35:35,480 --> 03:35:35,660
Wait.

3000
03:35:39,350 --> 03:35:40,090

Thank you for the super chat.

3015
03:37:13,000 --> 03:37:15,020
But yeah, this was a lot of fun.

3016
03:37:16,040 --> 03:37:22,980
It was good seeing things that I've never seen before and
remembering things that I have seen before sometimes.

3017
03:37:24,240 --> 03:37:30,360
And then also my game not breaking so I could do the bucket,
you know?

3018
03:37:35,820 --> 03:37:37,740
But I think, I don't know.

3019
03:37:37,900 --> 03:37:40,060
How many endings are there even?

3020
03:37:45,120 --> 03:37:47,040
Be wary of the time, vampires.

3021
03:37:47,480 --> 03:37:48,500
Yeah, yeah, right?

3022
03:37:49,640 --> 03:37:50,620
Oh, my gosh.

3023
03:37:52,220 --> 03:37:52,900
Five clicks?

3024
03:37:53,060 --> 03:37:54,400
No, I'm gonna do 10 clicks.

3025
03:37:54,580 --> 03:37:55,500
I'm gonna do 11 clicks.

3026
03:37:55,660 --> 03:37:57,140
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna do 50 clicks.

3027
03:37:57,480 --> 03:37:58,940
I don't even know what you're talking about.

3028
03:37:59,300 --> 03:38:01,460
I don't even keep spamming five clicks.

3029
03:38:01,820 --> 03:38:04,400
Why do I feel like I'm in the ice monkey all over again?

3030
03:38:05,140 --> 03:38:06,200
Thank you for the bucket stream.

3031
03:38:06,320 --> 03:38:10,460
Just want to say, even if you didn't win, your match with
Philly and last night was fantastic.

3032
03:38:11,040 --> 03:38:13,260
Even though I teleported and then I...

3033
03:38:15,020 --> 03:38:17,020
I teleported and then...

3034
03:38:17,020 --> 03:38:18,640
And then I...

3035
03:38:18,640 --> 03:38:21,180
20 plus endings in the bucket doubles it?

3036
03:38:21,380 --> 03:38:21,600
No way.

3037
03:38:21,680 --> 03:38:22,840
Oh my god, stupid shark!

3038
03:38:23,380 --> 03:38:24,260
Thank you for the 20 gift!

3039
03:38:24,440 --> 03:38:25,180
Thank you!

3040
03:38:25,920 --> 03:38:27,460
0, 0, 0 Ice Monkey.

3041
03:38:27,600 --> 03:38:30,140
5 click, 5 click, 5 click of Ice Monkey.

3042
03:38:34,640 --> 03:38:37,340
I teleported behind her and it didn't even make a
difference.

3043
03:38:39,340 --> 03:38:39,740
SMH.

3044
03:38:40,340 --> 03:38:40,740
SMH.

3045
03:38:41,160 --> 03:38:43,880
But it's okay, I beat Matara and that's all that really
mattered.

3046
03:38:44,060 --> 03:38:52,420
Plus, I think I would have felt really bad if I had made it
the finals because i was i was kind of a joke entry so i was

3047
03:38:52,420 --> 03:39:06,060
kind of a joke entry so you know um but it was it was a lot
of fun um actually i'm going to move us over to uh the mid

03:39:06,060 --> 03:39:10,420

I'm not naked.

3051
03:39:18,700 --> 03:39:20,280
I'm just...

3052
03:39:20,280 --> 03:39:21,360
I'm not naked.

3053
03:39:21,540 --> 03:39:22,260
I'm just...

3054
03:39:25,360 --> 03:39:25,980

Hold on.

3059
03:39:36,460 --> 03:39:37,620
Hold on, I'm getting dressed!

3060
03:39:38,700 --> 03:39:40,080
Let me exit out of the game too.

3061
03:39:40,660 --> 03:39:42,260
Quit to menu...

3062
03:39:43,880 --> 03:39:45,160
Quit to desktop.

3063
03:39:46,260 --> 03:39:47,500
Let's put on something chill.

3064
03:39:50,360 --> 03:39:51,000
Some music.

3065
03:39:51,440 --> 03:39:52,340
Just for a little bit.

3066
03:39:52,580 --> 03:39:54,630
Because I have some stuff I need to take care of.

3067
03:39:59,460 --> 03:40:00,040
Uh.

3068
03:40:07,330 --> 03:40:07,730
Uh.

3069
03:40:08,210 --> 03:40:08,250
Uh.

3070
03:40:08,350 --> 03:40:09,090
Sorry, hold on.

3071
03:40:12,030 --> 03:40:13,100
There we go.

3072
03:40:21,540 --> 03:40:22,440
Okie dokie.

3073
03:40:23,400 --> 03:40:24,960
I'm all changed.

3074
03:40:25,640 --> 03:40:27,020
Oh, my arms.

3075
03:40:31,690 --> 03:40:32,810
My arms.

3076
03:40:37,020 --> 03:40:37,760
There we go.

3077
03:40:39,900 --> 03:40:40,800
I'll better.

3078
03:40:41,320 --> 03:40:42,020
Talk strings.

3079
03:40:42,300 --> 03:40:43,300
Thanks for the vibe gifted.

3080
03:40:43,760 --> 03:40:44,300
Thank you.

3081
03:40:44,800 --> 03:40:45,120

Thank you.

3086
03:40:48,080 --> 03:40:49,560
The whips singing karaoke is so cute.

3087
03:40:49,740 --> 03:40:50,260
I know, right?

3088
03:40:51,080 --> 03:40:53,320
I know, right?

3089
03:40:54,140 --> 03:40:55,920
Show them chicken wings.

3090
03:41:03,360 --> 03:41:04,540
Is this what you wanted?

3091
03:41:05,760 --> 03:41:06,600
Is this what you like?

3092
03:41:15,010 --> 03:41:16,350
Those two are still cooking in the...

3093
03:41:16,350 --> 03:41:17,810
It's Memorial Day!

3094
03:41:18,350 --> 03:41:20,210
Of course they're having a barbecue.

3095
03:41:21,110 --> 03:41:22,070
Gosh, duh.

3096
03:41:24,730 --> 03:41:25,890
She's gonna take off.

3097
03:41:27,510 --> 03:41:28,810
Oh, that was so fun.

3098
03:41:29,050 --> 03:41:29,630
Oh my gosh.

3099
03:41:29,730 --> 03:41:33,710
Maybe I'll do a part two and get some other of the endings.

3100
03:41:34,190 --> 03:41:43,830
like a little daunting I feel to get to first how much is in
the game but I'm really happy that I could uh at least get

3101
03:41:43,830 --> 03:41:49,970
the bucket at least the bucket ending was so fun I really
like that one ducky thanks for the vibe gifted thank you

3102
03:41:49,970 --> 03:41:58,110
thank you thank you what was your favorite bit maybe the
bucket I know it's like the most recent one but synapse

3103
03:41:58,110 --> 03:41:59,150
things are the super Jot.

3104
03:41:59,350 --> 03:42:00,450
Marisa, thanks for the Super Jot.

3105
03:42:02,030 --> 03:42:02,370
Um.

3106
03:42:04,230 --> 03:42:04,670
Uh.

3107
03:42:05,130 --> 03:42:09,650
But I know it was like, maybe because it was like the, it
felt newer.

3108
03:42:10,950 --> 03:42:18,530
But, um, I also really liked, uh, the, the, because, because
my game broke before in the hole, um, I never got to see

3109
03:42:18,530 --> 03:42:20,770
like all the special things that went on with it.

3110
03:42:20,930 --> 03:42:22,590
So that was really fun too.

3111
03:42:23,330 --> 03:42:24,050
And the skip button.

3112
03:42:24,130 --> 03:42:29,950
The skip button one really makes you just kind of, has like
a good, I don't want, It's not a feels good.

3113
03:42:30,330 --> 03:42:32,090
But it's like a good...

3114
03:42:33,770 --> 03:42:35,370
It makes you feel something.

3115
03:42:35,530 --> 03:42:36,030
You know what I mean?

3116
03:42:36,470 --> 03:42:38,110
It makes you feel.

3117
03:42:39,550 --> 03:42:42,010
Oh, the bottom of the mind control room song!

3118
03:42:42,110 --> 03:42:42,530
Yes!

3119
03:42:42,850 --> 03:42:44,190
That was so good!

3120
03:42:44,350 --> 03:42:46,230
Oh my gosh, I was so happy we got that one.

3121
03:42:46,570 --> 03:42:47,430
It was really awesome.

3122
03:42:47,730 --> 03:42:48,670
It's very somber.

3123
03:42:49,170 --> 03:42:50,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3124
03:42:51,450 --> 03:42:58,710
But that's crazy how much replayability this game has, you
know.

3125
03:43:01,770 --> 03:43:10,330
So this week will be a bit of a short week Of a stream I'll
be streaming I'll have a I have to still figure out what I'm

3126
03:43:10,330 --> 03:43:24,130
streaming Because I'll be going to Afkai For this weekend
And then from Afkai Matara and I will be going to To Japan

3127
03:43:24,130 --> 03:43:32,670
So While we're there We're kind of going to be like
streaming every other day so she'll stream one day and I'll

3128
03:43:32,670 --> 03:43:43,390
stream uh the next day and so on and so forth so uh probably
won't have a schedule for that um so I really apologize it's

3129
03:43:43,390 --> 03:43:52,670
been kind of like schedule this even last week and this week
and I didn't mean to not have a schedule last week um I

3130
03:43:52,670 --> 03:43:59,850
think um I kind of mentioned it uh well no I mentioned I
think I mentioned all the Patreon It was funny because I

3131
03:43:59,850 --> 03:44:07,790
saw, I would see some comments being like, I wonder if Mint
is keeping her schedule a secret because of WrestleTuber,

3132
03:44:08,050 --> 03:44:11,210
you know, because she doesn't want to spoil that she's going
to be a guest.

3133
03:44:11,810 --> 03:44:12,650
And I'll be honest.

3134
03:44:14,490 --> 03:44:15,990
Uh, that was not the case.

3135
03:44:16,170 --> 03:44:20,310
I, I just, I just didn't put one out.

3136
03:44:22,550 --> 03:44:26,850
I just didn't want to put one out because I was indecisive
about what I wanted to do.

3137
03:44:28,810 --> 03:44:40,010
because i'm like trying to figure out how do i get ready for
for my trips and and planning other stuff and contacting

3138
03:44:40,010 --> 03:44:49,930
sending emails and it's been a little it's been a little bit
overwhelming but um thinking mint is more clever than we

3139
03:44:49,930 --> 03:45:00,910
thought no actually the uh the wrestle tuber was pretty last
minute um but uh i'm gonna glad that i could participate um

3140
03:45:00,910 --> 03:45:10,810
last night last night uh doki and i we were up i was up
until like almost 4 a.m uh talking with her we were catching

3141
03:45:10,810 --> 03:45:28,990
up so um i was really glad i was really happy um because um
i was i was um i don't want to say too much about it um I

3142
03:45:28,990 --> 03:45:31,450
was like kind of nervous about reaching out.

3143
03:45:32,630 --> 03:45:41,190
I mostly I mostly kept my distance for a while because I
didn't want to make her uncomfortable.

3144
03:45:45,290 --> 03:45:47,390
ultimately, I'm glad that I did.

3145
03:45:51,730 --> 03:45:52,410
yeah.

3146
03:45:55,030 --> 03:45:57,450
I had a lot of fun for WrestleTuber.

3147
03:45:58,070 --> 03:45:58,290
Yeah.

3148
03:45:59,730 --> 03:46:15,740
you have no idea how well the oh the shippers are eating
this week uh uh i'm happy for you um i'm happy for you

3149
03:46:20,910 --> 03:46:23,490
but yeah um

3150
03:46:28,810 --> 03:46:29,950
They are eating good.

3151
03:46:33,710 --> 03:46:36,570
I'll be honest, I've seen fan art.

3152
03:46:37,150 --> 03:46:38,250
There's been a lot of fan art.

3153
03:46:38,790 --> 03:46:41,490
So there's been a lot of fan art.

3154
03:46:41,690 --> 03:46:42,470
So thank you guys.

3155
03:46:45,410 --> 03:46:47,330
What is bro yapping about?

3156
03:46:50,650 --> 03:46:57,810
And even Matara joining hers was like super last minute too.

3157
03:46:59,530 --> 03:47:01,030
And, you know, it was funny.

3158
03:47:01,410 --> 03:47:04,310
She sent me a couple of voice lines.

3159
03:47:04,450 --> 03:47:05,570
I was like, can you send me some stuff?

3160
03:47:05,630 --> 03:47:08,010
And then I'll send it over to her and to Doki.

3161
03:47:08,750 --> 03:47:11,790
And she can send it to her editor and this and that.

3162
03:47:13,230 --> 03:47:14,090
Matara was funny AF.

3163
03:47:14,350 --> 03:47:14,710
I know.

3164
03:47:15,510 --> 03:47:15,950
I wish.

3165
03:47:16,310 --> 03:47:20,470
I hope next time she can participate in person if she wants
to.

3166
03:47:20,930 --> 03:47:24,310
But I thought it was really funny that even I felt bad.

3167
03:47:24,370 --> 03:47:25,270
I was like, you're on vacation.

3168
03:47:25,510 --> 03:47:25,850
Sorry.

3169
03:47:28,510 --> 03:47:35,590
but the the editor cooked so much in such a short amount of

3190
03:50:56,410 --> 03:50:58,750
Maybe I shouldn't say that.

3191
03:51:00,830 --> 03:51:03,090
People love you, you dorkoid.

3192
03:51:03,210 --> 03:51:04,410
What does that mean?

3193
03:51:11,230 --> 03:51:14,920
But, uh...

3194
03:51:14,920 --> 03:51:15,640
My anniversary?

3195
03:51:19,040 --> 03:51:19,580
My anniversary?

3196
03:51:21,780 --> 03:51:23,100
Oh my god.

3197
03:51:23,460 --> 03:51:23,980
Wait!

3198
03:51:26,500 --> 03:51:28,280
It was so great to see you at Wrestle Timber.

3199
03:51:28,420 --> 03:51:30,640
I'm really glad you and Doki had a good time catching up.

3200
03:51:31,140 --> 03:51:31,680
Thank you!

3201
03:51:33,320 --> 03:51:35,780
Truly made me smile is how YouTube didn't seem to miss a
beat.

3202
03:51:36,220 --> 03:51:39,920
Immediately into the half laughing, half screaming and it
just...

3203
03:51:40,740 --> 03:51:42,980
I guess that's just...

3204
03:51:42,980 --> 03:51:43,560
I don't know.

3205
03:51:45,980 --> 03:51:46,860
I guess...

3206
03:51:48,060 --> 03:51:51,660
I don't know how to say.

3207
03:51:52,300 --> 03:51:55,100
Maybe it is our destiny to always...

3208
03:51:55,100 --> 03:51:56,080
Or to act that way.

3209
03:51:56,240 --> 03:51:59,780
Maybe I felt compelled even though I have never met her
before.

3210
03:52:06,660 --> 03:52:07,380
But yeah.

3211
03:52:09,400 --> 03:52:13,280
I know it's shocking, but so many people love, adore, and
support you.

3212
03:52:13,380 --> 03:52:13,940
You are amazing.

3213
03:52:14,140 --> 03:52:14,420
Oh!

3214
03:52:15,940 --> 03:52:16,880
I got home from Panama.

3215
03:52:17,060 --> 03:52:18,360
I saw a lot of fan merch of you.

3216
03:52:18,600 --> 03:52:19,560
See you all, hopefully.

3217
03:52:20,460 --> 03:52:21,140
See you!

3218
03:52:24,980 --> 03:52:26,220
I've been to all...

3219
03:52:26,240 --> 03:52:28,320
Dorkoid is the yellow one, regardless.

3220
03:52:28,600 --> 03:52:29,300
We love you, Mito.

3221
03:52:29,860 --> 03:52:31,240
What I mean by that is, we love you.

3222
03:52:34,200 --> 03:52:35,160
Stop it.

3223
03:52:35,280 --> 03:52:36,400
Stop it.

3224
03:52:41,460 --> 03:52:41,940
Dorkoid.

3225
03:52:42,580 --> 03:52:43,060
Dorkoid.

3226
03:52:48,960 --> 03:52:49,920
But, um...

3227
03:52:51,880 --> 03:52:55,920
I love the part where Doki accidentally called herself Small
Brain and you were like, yep.

3228
03:52:58,500 --> 03:53:00,280
She's a bird after all.

3229
03:53:01,160 --> 03:53:01,540
You know.

3230
03:53:03,320 --> 03:53:04,480
She's a bird after all.

3231
03:53:05,000 --> 03:53:06,280
Favorite moment from WrestleTuber?

3232
03:53:13,390 --> 03:53:14,110
Ah.

3233
03:53:14,870 --> 03:53:20,130
I think Yu San's entrance was so...

3234
03:53:20,130 --> 03:53:22,090
I didn't even know that was going to happen.

3235
03:53:23,770 --> 03:53:24,490
So...

3236
03:53:24,490 --> 03:53:26,350
I didn't...

3237
03:53:26,350 --> 03:53:28,790
That was my first time seeing that too.

3238
03:53:29,410 --> 03:53:34,030
So, it was really, really something.

3239
03:53:36,290 --> 03:53:38,230
Will you let us know when you get in the robot at Offkay?

3240
03:53:38,610 --> 03:53:40,250
I didn't get a meeting greet, but still want to meet you.

3241
03:53:40,570 --> 03:53:44,350
I think that's still being planned.

3242
03:53:45,190 --> 03:53:48,290
But once I know anything, I know it's like kind of last
minute.

3243
03:53:48,930 --> 03:53:50,470
Because Offkay is this weekend.

3244
03:53:50,670 --> 03:53:52,890
Oh my gosh, Offkay is this weekend, you guys.

3245
03:53:53,370 --> 03:53:54,050
Oh my gosh.

3246
03:53:54,450 --> 03:53:57,830
But I will let you guys know as soon as I know.

3247
03:53:59,870 --> 03:54:06,870
because yeah I don't don't know what thanks for being at the
truck event thank you yeah the truck event was really fun

3248
03:54:06,870 --> 03:54:23,110
too everybody was super duper hype and hold on sorry and
there were so many people I was I was really shocked

3249
03:54:23,110 --> 03:54:30,810
actually right before I went on I was like messaging my
friend because she was there Oh gosh, they kind of

3250
03:54:30,810 --> 03:54:33,470
sandwiched me between two DJs.

3251
03:54:34,210 --> 03:54:39,410
I'm gonna bring the mood down so much because I'm like, not
a DJ, it's not like continuous music.

3252
03:54:39,670 --> 03:54:42,610
Like I'm gonna be singing and it's gonna be weird.

3253
03:54:42,750 --> 03:54:44,310
And she was like, no, it'll be fine.

3254
03:54:45,510 --> 03:54:48,070
You'll just, you'll have a lot of fun.

3255
03:54:48,610 --> 03:54:51,210
And so I was really, really actually quite nervous about it.

3256
03:54:53,850 --> 03:54:58,070
And possible block game adventure collab with who?

3257
03:54:59,650 --> 03:55:00,130
Maybe.

3258
03:55:03,830 --> 03:55:07,090
I don't really know how I can feel more proud.

3259
03:55:07,330 --> 03:55:09,470
Thank you for existing the way you are, but don't stop.

3260
03:55:11,670 --> 03:55:12,630
Thank you.

3261
03:55:16,810 --> 03:55:23,450
I'm so happy you chose to reach out to interacting and speak
content and she could use a friend who can call her out on

3262
03:55:23,450 --> 03:55:24,090
her shit.

3263
03:55:26,910 --> 03:55:27,390
Yeah.

3264
03:55:29,050 --> 03:55:39,150
me out we call out each other i feel i actually think i get
dumber around her i actually think i'm like i'm physically

3265
03:55:39,150 --> 03:55:41,830
stupid more stupid when she's around

3266
03:55:46,230 --> 03:55:52,250
rachel tober was awesome it's so great to hear you took you
time outside of the event to hang thanks for sharing it

3267
03:55:52,250 --> 03:55:55,970
means a lot of to us better social weirdos we love you guys
you deserve

3268
03:56:03,210 --> 03:56:05,350
Brain cell sharing is real

3269
03:56:08,610 --> 03:56:15,350
Oh my gosh Rice Nat and Orca right next to each other Please
stop Stop

3270
03:56:18,730 --> 03:56:20,710
What was I going to say though?

3271
03:56:25,570 --> 03:56:31,090
Don't call them out like that Oh, they were right next to
each other.

3272
03:56:34,570 --> 03:56:36,150
I can't help what I see.

3273
03:56:36,330 --> 03:56:38,890
I can't help what pops up on my Twitter, you know?

3274
03:56:39,490 --> 03:56:40,630
I can't help it.

3275
03:56:41,310 --> 03:56:42,410
Good to see you at the truck.

3276
03:56:42,550 --> 03:56:43,170
Thank you!

3277
03:56:43,730 --> 03:56:46,290
But yeah, so I was really nervous for the truck.

3278
03:56:46,490 --> 03:56:48,910
And then, in the end, everybody was...

3279
03:56:48,910 --> 03:56:50,570
The energy was so there.

3280
03:56:51,730 --> 03:56:53,070
People were lifting.

3281
03:56:53,790 --> 03:56:54,890
There was Kujaku.

3282
03:56:55,350 --> 03:56:57,590
There was so much going on.

3283
03:56:57,710 --> 03:56:58,810
It was a lot, a lot of fun.

3284
03:56:59,050 --> 03:57:03,650
And people, there are people on top of cars, on top of
trucks watching.

3285
03:57:04,330 --> 03:57:05,450
We love Anikuda.

3286
03:57:06,150 --> 03:57:07,170
Anikuda, psycho!

3287
03:57:09,670 --> 03:57:11,510
Oh, his sweater has been so good.

3288
03:57:15,630 --> 03:57:18,150
Oh, they built a fire pit out of glow sticks.

3289
03:57:18,310 --> 03:57:32,410
Yeah, if anybody went to see me, and I've never been to
Anikuda before, i hope that you got a little bit of a taste

3290
03:57:32,410 --> 03:57:41,770
of why i love idols so much and idol and like you know doing
calls and um just stuff like that like it's just a such a

3291
03:57:41,770 --> 03:58:00,090
fun energy that um that um truly only can be felt in that
kind of in that kind of place so oh it was so fun though I

3292
03:58:00,090 --> 03:58:11,090
felt so happy I just felt so fulfilled on on Saturday I was
honestly just this weekend this past weekend I felt so

3293
03:58:11,090 --> 03:58:21,490
fulfilled I felt really I probably felt the happiest I have
in in quite a while.

3294
03:58:24,890 --> 03:58:25,970
I'm really happy.

3295
03:58:29,370 --> 03:58:33,590
Wish I could have gone to the truck event even though it was
a drive-away, but Russell Tuber was wild.

3296
03:58:34,170 --> 03:58:36,310
Glad you had fun and hope you had fun in JP too.

3297
03:58:36,670 --> 03:58:37,550
Thank you, Jay!

3298
03:58:37,650 --> 03:58:38,530
Thank you for the welcome, Silva.

3299
03:58:38,670 --> 03:58:39,530
Thank you so much.

3300
03:58:39,830 --> 03:58:40,370
Thank you.

3301
03:58:43,590 --> 03:58:48,070
There's still things that I'm trying to catch up on.

3302
03:58:49,410 --> 03:59:00,610
some things that I feel like I still feel I still feel
really nervous about or uncertain I guess maybe is a better

3303
03:59:00,610 --> 03:59:11,150
word because I feel sort of like how do I say this?

3304
03:59:11,770 --> 03:59:13,770
How do I say this without being weird?

3305
03:59:15,130 --> 03:59:15,950
Everything's weird though.

3306
03:59:17,090 --> 03:59:21,630
I feel I think basically I...

3307
03:59:21,630 --> 03:59:23,230
I don't know how to say it.

3308
03:59:23,410 --> 03:59:24,870
Sorry, I'm not very articulate.

3309
03:59:28,590 --> 03:59:29,870
Step by stuff.

3310
03:59:29,990 --> 03:59:32,370
I guess that's mainly it.

3311
03:59:33,150 --> 03:59:35,090
I'm just trying to take things step by step.

3312
03:59:35,290 --> 03:59:38,130
But I'm trying not to...

3313
03:59:39,850 --> 03:59:41,010
Lose out.

3314
03:59:41,930 --> 03:59:45,090
I'm trying not to be so passive that I...

3315
03:59:46,230 --> 03:59:48,010
Lose out on opportunity.

3316
03:59:49,690 --> 04:00:02,010
it's kind of it's hard it's hard it's hard going from going
from a place that took care of everything for you to having

3317
04:00:02,010 --> 04:00:15,050
to do everything on my own and you know not knowing at all
what to do or how to do anything and being by myself um so

3318
04:00:15,050 --> 04:00:37,990
um oh sorry i'm i'm biting my tongue a little bit here but
uh it's a big adjustment i bet yeah so um but hopefully

3319
04:00:37,990 --> 04:00:46,830
hopefully i can get things um moving especially once i get
back from japan hopefully i can get things moving forward

3320
04:00:46,830 --> 04:00:54,250
and you know know moving forward means not only just more
opportunities for me but then also more things for you guys

3321
04:00:54,250 --> 04:01:06,050
as well because um thank you for not becoming a grocer stop
why did you guys always bring up that i was thinking why did

3322
04:01:06,050 --> 04:01:14,870
you guys always bring that up oh my gosh we believe in you
thank you yeah it's

3323
04:01:18,060 --> 04:01:22,500
okay to be weird weird droid What does that mean?

3324
04:01:25,240 --> 04:01:37,820
Oh But um It's because it's so upsetting you even thought
about it It's surreal to think it was a possibility Because

3325
04:01:37,820 --> 04:01:39,920
it's such a shocking thing to hear what?

3326
04:01:41,120 --> 04:01:42,200
What do you mean?

3327
04:01:42,720 --> 04:01:49,400
Oh my gosh, thank you for the aquasupa I'd like that wait
like what me to become a grocer

3328
04:01:53,680 --> 04:01:56,060
This is so Akasupa telling me to quit.

3329
04:02:05,280 --> 04:02:08,760
If you became a grocer, I would buy food every day.

3330
04:02:12,200 --> 04:02:16,160
I would just be back as a normal ghost.

3331
04:02:17,220 --> 04:02:19,600
Don't worry, I'd avoid the self-checkout for you.

3332
04:02:20,060 --> 04:02:20,660
No.

3333
04:02:27,740 --> 04:02:28,620

04:04:39,790 --> 04:04:42,490
I had no idea that there was going to be an open ticket
sale.

3354
04:04:44,470 --> 04:04:45,590
Oh, I had no idea.

3355
04:04:45,870 --> 04:04:47,050

04:05:02,310 --> 04:05:04,390
What a crazy person that could have been us.

3364
04:05:06,850 --> 04:05:08,530
Yeah, that could have been me.

3365
04:05:10,170 --> 04:05:11,030
That could have been me.

3366
04:05:14,490 --> 04:05:15,830
You'll never guess who won it.

3367
04:05:16,070 --> 04:05:16,890
Oh gosh, I'm scared.

3368
04:05:18,950 --> 04:05:20,370
There was only one left.

3369
04:05:20,650 --> 04:05:22,150
There was only one left?

3370
04:05:22,910 --> 04:05:23,130
What?

3371
04:05:24,350 --> 04:05:25,330
Actually, just one?

3372
04:05:37,680 --> 04:05:38,760
That's crazy.

3373
04:05:39,080 --> 04:05:40,280
That only...

3374
04:05:40,980 --> 04:05:42,860
The one piece.

3375
04:05:45,280 --> 04:05:47,040
That's insane that there was...

3376
04:05:47,040 --> 04:05:48,120
Just like...

3377
04:05:48,120 --> 04:05:51,500
The one person canceled and then the one opened up.

3378
04:05:51,640 --> 04:05:52,420
That's so funny.

3379
04:05:53,900 --> 04:05:54,520
Oh my gosh.

3380
04:05:55,160 --> 04:05:55,860

3381
04:05:56,420 --> 04:05:57,600

3388
04:06:32,300 --> 04:06:35,160
been loved as an indie that's active for less than a year.

3389
04:06:36,520 --> 04:06:42,640
As an indie that's active for less than a year, you had more
wiki entries than some much bigger VTubers.

3390
04:06:44,080 --> 04:06:46,420
Wiki, wiki, wiki, wiki entries!

3391
04:06:49,380 --> 04:06:50,780
So happy I became a member.

3392
04:06:51,140 --> 04:06:51,740
Here's to the future.

3393
04:06:51,820 --> 04:06:52,580
Thank you!

3394
04:06:53,640 --> 04:06:54,800
Thank you, thank you!

3395
04:06:56,740 --> 04:06:57,340
Wiki, wiki.

3396
04:06:58,180 --> 04:06:59,180
Wiki, wiki, wiki.

3397
04:06:59,500 --> 04:06:59,520
Wait.

3398
04:06:59,980 --> 04:07:00,960
Wiki entries.

3399
04:07:02,200 --> 04:07:02,680
Wiki.

3400
04:07:06,690 --> 04:07:08,190
Wiki entry, like a Wikipedia?

3401
04:07:10,150 --> 04:07:10,950
Like a...

3402
04:07:10,950 --> 04:07:12,530
There's the VTuber Wiki though, right?

3403
04:07:16,510 --> 04:07:17,310
Thank you.

3404
04:07:17,610 --> 04:07:19,490
Thank you for whoever's updating that.

3405
04:07:20,670 --> 04:07:21,250
I suppose.

3406
04:07:23,770 --> 04:07:26,550
Probably hadn't been updated in a really long time.

3407
04:07:28,110 --> 04:07:29,410
Good luck reaching out to new people.

3408
04:07:29,590 --> 04:07:31,550
I know it can be hard sometimes, but I know you can do it.

3409
04:07:31,770 --> 04:07:32,270
Have a good night.

3410
04:07:32,370 --> 04:07:32,890
Thanks, Meryl.

3411
04:07:33,130 --> 04:07:34,990
Oh yeah, it's pretty late now, wasn't it?

3412
04:07:36,670 --> 04:07:44,170
Um, if you guys had the day off, maybe people in the United
States, then I hope you had a good day off.

3413
04:07:44,450 --> 04:07:45,230
The Feet Wiki.

3414
04:07:46,030 --> 04:07:46,970
Shut up, Cole.

3415
04:07:48,130 --> 04:07:49,030
What are you at?

3416
04:07:49,130 --> 04:07:50,590
I saw the figure you made.

3417
04:07:51,590 --> 04:07:52,810
It looks so good.

3418
04:07:53,150 --> 04:07:54,510
It looks so good.

3419
04:07:55,450 --> 04:07:58,090
But don't put it on the Feet Wiki, please.

3420
04:08:01,130 --> 04:08:02,850
It looks so awesome.

3421
04:08:03,670 --> 04:08:04,950
Thank you for making it.

3422
04:08:07,530 --> 04:08:08,010
CD?

3423
04:08:08,810 --> 04:08:09,490
Is that how you say your name?

3424
04:08:10,090 --> 04:08:11,070
Said I.

3425
04:08:12,070 --> 04:08:13,050
Welcome to membership.

3426
04:08:13,210 --> 04:08:13,690
Thank you.

3427
04:08:16,190 --> 04:08:19,390
The crazy thing about the VTuber wiki is that anyone can
edit it.

3428
04:08:20,030 --> 04:08:20,750
Even me?

3429
04:08:21,610 --> 04:08:23,010
I'm gonna go edit my own wiki.

3430
04:08:26,090 --> 04:08:28,270
I'm just gonna copy and paste the Metal Gear wiki.

3431
04:08:28,830 --> 04:08:32,190
I'm gonna copy and paste the synopsis of Metal Gear Solid.

3432
04:08:32,350 --> 04:08:33,310
I'm gonna replace my it.

3433
04:08:33,350 --> 04:08:33,950
Don't do that.

3434
04:08:34,210 --> 04:08:36,190
There's probably some people that would be so upset.

3435
04:08:36,690 --> 04:08:48,410
like you just erased all their hard work and then and then
and then they're like they come back they're just like oh

3436
04:08:48,410 --> 04:08:57,370
something else happened with mint phantom i'm gonna i'm
gonna update her wiki and it's all gone and replaced by

3437
04:08:57,370 --> 04:09:00,730
metal gear synopsis

3438
04:09:04,940 --> 04:09:08,620
don't get banned but i get banned for that it's my own wiki.

3439
04:09:08,840 --> 04:09:11,240
This is the information that people need to read, okay?

3440
04:09:11,640 --> 04:09:12,560
This is the information.

3441
04:09:13,780 --> 04:09:15,940
May I ask how is the stinkiest boy doing?

3442
04:09:16,700 --> 04:09:17,640
Thanks for asking, Sham.

3443
04:09:19,300 --> 04:09:20,640
Andrico's thanks for the 10 gift aid!

3444
04:09:22,140 --> 04:09:22,640
Uh...

3445
04:09:22,640 --> 04:09:23,920
I forgot... Wait, hold on.

3446
04:09:24,020 --> 04:09:27,560
I forgot if you mentioned this before, but do you accept
snacks as gifts at Ofkai?

3447
04:09:29,280 --> 04:09:31,960
Um... Sealed snacks, uh...

3448
04:09:31,960 --> 04:09:33,880
I... Probably...

3449
04:09:33,880 --> 04:09:36,120
I think it's technically said no food.

3450
04:09:37,260 --> 04:09:37,760
Um...

3451
04:09:38,060 --> 04:09:40,160
I kind of, I don't, I don't really mind.

3452
04:09:40,380 --> 04:09:41,420
I mean, I don't know.

3453
04:09:45,300 --> 04:09:47,440
You can fill the page with all new mint lore.

3454
04:09:50,300 --> 04:09:53,360
But, um, um,

3455
04:09:56,970 --> 04:09:58,490
um, Butaro, Butaro, Butaro, Butaro.

3456
04:09:59,910 --> 04:10:01,790
He's been acting a little weird lately.

3457
04:10:02,570 --> 04:10:07,590
Um, lately he's been, like, just, um, very much, like,
hanging out under the bed.

3458
04:10:09,510 --> 04:10:10,970
And I can't get him out.

3459
04:10:11,250 --> 04:10:12,230
Like, he'll eat.

3460
04:10:13,390 --> 04:10:22,970
doesn't hang out with me i think he is in this weird
adjustment with um with paus and that like paus started

3461
04:10:22,970 --> 04:10:29,550
sleeping in the bed just a little bit and i think it's made
him a little self-conscious or not self-conscious a little

3462
04:10:29,550 --> 04:10:43,090
um worried like he maybe is like his his personal space is
getting taken over so um how old is he he's pretty old but

3463
04:10:43,090 --> 04:10:49,130
he's still still very active like he's still running around
like they play together so but then he just kind of goes and

3464
04:10:49,130 --> 04:11:03,550
retreats under the bed yeah he's very territorial he's super
duper territorial so um uh but he's sour about having an

3465
04:11:03,550 --> 04:11:13,190
interloper yeah which is i thought it was weird because um
it's been over a month now but um i think because it don't

3466
04:11:13,190 --> 04:11:21,010
it he only started acting this way once she started sleeping
in the bed with me so i think he was just like whoa whoa

3467
04:11:21,010 --> 04:11:30,770
whoa i'm fine with her being around but in the bed um that
is my spot i won't be able to harvest any in time for afkai

3468
04:11:30,770 --> 04:11:37,270
but i think if i can get some honey from my beehives would
she want some technically it's food and not sealed no

3469
04:11:37,270 --> 04:11:46,910
judgment if not oh morning dude that sounds so awesome but
honestly i also worry about traveling with it um and i'm

3470
04:11:46,910 --> 04:11:57,350
afraid that maybe even staff would reject it um so i'm so
sorry i hope that sounds i would love your honey i want to

3471
04:11:57,350 --> 04:11:58,170
get fresh honey

3472
04:12:02,740 --> 04:12:07,780

Whippy!

3483

3486
04:13:41,700 --> 04:13:43,520
Does Fortnite a snake count?

3487
04:13:43,640 --> 04:13:45,440
Oh my gosh, I should play that, right?

3488
04:13:46,060 --> 04:13:49,480
I should, I wonder if I could get Doki to play Fortnite with
me.

3489
04:13:51,360 --> 04:13:52,580
I should ask her.

3490
04:13:55,260 --> 04:13:57,560
So, we're finally getting acid.

3491
04:13:57,820 --> 04:13:58,920
Yeah, yeah!

3492
04:13:59,760 --> 04:14:00,480
So, I did.

3493
04:14:00,560 --> 04:14:07,240
I know I did the Twin Snakes some time ago, but I really,
really just want to have all of the Metal Gears kind of on

3494
04:14:07,240 --> 04:14:09,520
my resume in my channel.

3495
04:14:10,260 --> 04:14:15,360
So, I hope you guys don't mind that I'll be playing a lot of
Metal Gear.

3496
04:14:15,620 --> 04:14:17,660
until probably the end of the year.

3497
04:14:19,740 --> 04:14:21,100
Are we getting Survive?

3498
04:14:21,220 --> 04:14:23,440
Oh, that's another thing I need to play with, don't kiss.

3499
04:14:27,860 --> 04:14:29,140
There's too much stuff.

3500
04:14:29,700 --> 04:14:30,300
Ellie's so hard.

3501
04:14:30,540 --> 04:14:31,860
Thank you for the Super Jet.

3502
04:14:32,260 --> 04:14:32,660
Thank you.

3503
04:14:34,060 --> 04:14:35,300
Hoping for Ace Combat 2.

3504
04:14:35,480 --> 04:14:40,020
I think once I'm done with the Metal Gear stuff, I will go
into Ace Combat.

3505
04:14:40,200 --> 04:14:43,360
And then I think after Ace Combat, I might even start Xeno
Blade.

3506
04:14:45,880 --> 04:14:47,720
It is a long journey.

3507
04:14:48,560 --> 04:14:50,940
Time to put Doki into playing MGS.

3508
04:14:53,720 --> 04:15:02,020
But, um, it'll be like a long, I feel like almost probably a
year's worth of just like long story-based games.

3509
04:15:05,240 --> 04:15:08,000
you can, I guess, look forward to that.

3510
04:15:10,000 --> 04:15:10,560
Yippee!

3511
04:15:12,380 --> 04:15:22,920
Um, and of course, and of course, it's not just the only
stuff that i'll be playing so membu fortnite maybe that'd be

3512
04:15:22,920 --> 04:15:42,660
fun wait can we do like a lobby or is it would i have to can

3516
04:16:11,080 --> 04:16:12,000
We will see.

3517
04:16:12,020 --> 04:16:12,900
A manga card.

3518
04:16:13,120 --> 04:16:13,640
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

3519
04:16:13,780 --> 04:16:14,300
Thank you.

3520
04:16:14,920 --> 04:16:18,060
But yeah, that's just kind of some of my future plans that
I've been thinking about.

3521
04:16:20,860 --> 04:16:27,940
And like I said, I know I've played Metal Gear before, so I
hope that it will still be a fun experience for people.

3522
04:16:28,060 --> 04:16:32,600
I was kind of nervous because I was like, what if people
don't want to watch me play if I've already played

3523
04:16:32,600 --> 04:16:33,600
everything before?

3524
04:16:33,700 --> 04:16:35,860
And I already know all the twists and I know this and that.

3525
04:16:35,860 --> 04:16:47,420
but um uh hopefully like I said I kind of just want the
games on my channel so if people come to my channel they're

3526
04:16:47,420 --> 04:16:55,080
just like oh wow she really likes metal gear you can always
play MGS 1 integral English and VR missions to check them

3527
04:16:55,080 --> 04:17:02,920
off your resume and then you can officially say you played
all versions of MGS 1 true one thing that I wanted to do was

3528
04:17:02,920 --> 04:17:09,180
um uh was play the different versions of the game.

3529
04:17:09,440 --> 04:17:15,880
So basically, like, if I played the HD collection of
something, maybe I'll play the original, like, PS2 version

3530
04:17:15,880 --> 04:17:17,440
of it this time.

3531
04:17:18,380 --> 04:17:28,000
So, um, I'm still working on that to, uh, um, to give it a
little bit of difference.

3532
04:17:31,260 --> 04:17:34,120
Um, hey, Bozo, do better.

3533
04:17:34,800 --> 04:17:35,700
Yo, oh, do better.

3534
04:17:38,260 --> 04:17:40,140
I'm sorry, I'll do it.

3535
04:17:40,300 --> 04:17:42,620
You better do whatever the hell you want.

3536
04:17:48,060 --> 04:17:50,140
I completely rented a stoop.

3537
04:17:55,120 --> 04:17:55,680
Stop!

3538
04:17:56,920 --> 04:17:59,160
I'm gonna cry again with Peace Walk running.

3539
04:17:59,380 --> 04:18:00,120
Me too.

3540
04:18:00,940 --> 04:18:04,800
Oh gosh, I just, I'm actually most excited to play MGS2
again.

3541
04:18:05,760 --> 04:18:12,020
I think at the end I'm just gonna be a little baby ball and
just like I don't know there's something about the end of

3542
04:18:12,020 --> 04:18:25,900
MGS 2 that makes me feel so even though it was riding so
silly dumb stupid ah but yeah um anyway do better mint

3543
04:18:32,300 --> 04:18:37,540

tomorrow.

3544
04:18:38,100 --> 04:18:39,160
Don't know what I'm playing tomorrow.

3545
04:18:40,620 --> 04:18:40,860
Oh, wait.

3546
04:18:41,020 --> 04:18:42,160
Maybe I think I do know.

3547
04:18:42,260 --> 04:18:42,680
Why don't we wait?

3548
04:18:44,480 --> 04:18:47,860
Uh, I had an idea for something I was going to do tomorrow,
and I don't remember.

3549
04:18:48,020 --> 04:18:49,280
So, I'm going to sleep on it.

3550
04:18:50,080 --> 04:18:51,440
No, not Metal Gear Survive.

3551
04:18:51,580 --> 04:18:52,560
It's the Black Sushi.

3552
04:18:52,980 --> 04:18:54,400
I have to do it.

3553
04:18:55,900 --> 04:18:56,740
Just a little bit.

3554
04:18:57,100 --> 04:18:57,720
Just a little bit.

3555
04:18:59,140 --> 04:19:03,580
Any chance of uploading your truck rave performance to
members to premiere on one of your off days?

3556
04:19:04,060 --> 04:19:09,680

04:19:11,440 --> 04:19:14,200
Oh, the one that I recorded.

04:19:17,160 --> 04:19:17,780
Yes.

3560
04:19:18,060 --> 04:19:23,000
