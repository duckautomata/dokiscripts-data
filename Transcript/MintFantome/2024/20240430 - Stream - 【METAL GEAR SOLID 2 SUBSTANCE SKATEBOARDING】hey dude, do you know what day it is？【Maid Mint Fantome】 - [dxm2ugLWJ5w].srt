50
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,340
The Forgotten Sibling of the Emmerichs.

51
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,760
What's wrong with BB?

52
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,340
Skateboarding, that's a thing.

53
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,220
Oh yeah, it's only for...

54
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,480
It's only for MGS2 Substance.

55
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,700
So if you give it like the Master Collection or anything
like that, it's not going to be on there.

56
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,120
You got to get MGS2 Substance for the PS2.

57
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:57,160
2 baby I got my PS2 set up right over there I got my retro
tank 4k all hooked up I'm ready I'm so ready to skateboard

58
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:08,040
um honestly um I can't say how long today's stream is gonna
be because we could um I think there's like not that much to

59
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:15,720
do with this but um Yeah, I dropped some...

60
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,940
Okay, because I, like, was planning on doing a bunch of,
like, you know, PS2 games and stuff like that, I kind of

61
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,020
dropped the money on it.

62
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,360
So, it's for your viewing pleasure, everybody.

63
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,260
It's for your viewing pleasure.

64
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,220
You're welcome.

65
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,900
Oh, thank you for the Supertask, you guys!

66
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:43,120
I totally thought about doing, like, a marathon for this
stream.

67
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:54,600
you know playing up playing up to you know the game or like
playing marathoning the game or something but um honestly I

68
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:03,000
thought I kind of want to save MGS2 again for when I
properly replay the series so I didn't want to replay it and

69
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,520
have it on my channel and or play it have it on my channel
and then replay it again like sometime uh down the line I

70
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:20,460
don't know when so instead I was like can i do for april
30th and i was like oh wait a second i know the coolest

71
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,300

72
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:44,000
so without further ado oh sorry you'll see the everything
kind of loading feels so it feels so old School, right?

73
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,160
Oh my gosh.

74
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,060

76
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,410
Oh, yeah!

77
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:03,660
Raiden, to disarm the terrorists, you must shred on Arsenal
Gear.

78
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:18,370
Raiden, to save America, do An Olly, I don't know.

79
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,960
Welcome everybody to MGS2!

80
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,220
Let's see, controller.

81
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,020
We got Olly, small jump, hold the button to crouch and
release to jump.

82
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,080
That's the X button.

83
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,680
Simple enough, dude.

84
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,860
We got this dude.

85
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,360
We can grind, rail slide, jump on a rail, etc.

86
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
And hold down the triangle button to grind.

87
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,680
Oh yeah.

88
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,160
Riden, flips and grabs are done in mid-air.

89
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,040
A series of tricks can be done until you reach the ground.

90
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,000
Got it, dude.

91
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,340
We need those six flips, boss.

92
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,940
I got you.

93
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,540
Can't wait for Riden to activate roller blade mode.

94
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,980
Riden, do spins by turning while in mid-air.

95
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,000
Okay, L2 and R2 are spin.

96
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,780
Grab a circle, flip a square.

97
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,120
Um, I probably won't remember any of these.

98
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,780
Take a dup on your board.

99
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,680
Don't do that.

100
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,800
Don't dup on the board.

101
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,580
Duping is uncool.

102
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,300
On the board.

103
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, hiya.

104
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,720
Oh, hiya, gozaiima.

105
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,220
A dupe?

106
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,880
Nah, it's just Metal Gear Rising things, you know.

107
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,740
Riding gets it, riding gets it.

108
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,640
That was the audio, by the way.

109
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,040
Apparently there's a really cool remix of the song, so are
you shredding Mint?

110
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Oh yeah!

111
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,840
Let's start.

112
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,080
Wait.

113
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,500
Oh my gosh, no way.

114
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,780
Hold on.

115
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,020
Let me go back real quick.

116
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,180
Ollie, grind, flip, and grab.

117
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:33,880
Flip and grab.

118
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,720
Flip, grab, flip, grab.

119
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:39,720
Grind, grind.

120
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,960
Ollie, Ollie, Ollie, Ollie.

121
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,160
Ollie, Ollie, up.

122
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,600
Time for a stream.

123
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,380
Also, I finally saved up the last $5 I own.

124
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,320
Oh, I own the Canadian Mafia stuff.

125
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,900
These DMV photos, they don't even look like them.

126
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,740
Like, what are these models?

127
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,140
They look so strange.

128
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,740
Who should we start as?

129
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,820
Should we start as Raiden because it's his big day?

130
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,620
Or should we start as Snake and finish with Raiden because
it's Raiden's big day, everybody?

131
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,360
No, that is not solid Snake.

132
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,460
Skateboard.

133
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,960
Snake first?

134
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,560
Alright.

135
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,560
Now loading.

136
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,520
Okay, here we go, baby.

137
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,960
All right, Ollie, grind.

138
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,220
Oh, I don't remember which one's flipping, which one's...

139
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,280
All right, mission information.

140
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,600
Snake, score 8,000 points.

141
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,540
Find the hidden item.

142
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,800
Grind 150 meters.

143
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,200
Collect four dog tags.

144
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,340
Destroy all three uninhabited probes.

145
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,420

That was a big fall!

00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,600
That was a big fall!

153
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,980
Are you okay, Snake?

154
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,340
Oh, I have to get on top of those.

155
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:49,820
Okay, hold on.

156
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,750
Oh, nice!

00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:57,990
Good job, Snake!

158
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,370
Good job!

00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,630
How many meters was it?

163
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,870
How do I take this thing out?

164
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,750
Oh my god, it's shooting at me.

165
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,170
Kickflip!

00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,230
Yes!

167
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,030
You should be more careful.

168
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,590
All you did was...

169
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,690
Snake, all you did was jump.

170
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,400
Oh my god!

171
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,660
How do I get the things up there?

172
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,630
Maybe here.

00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,110
How do I get it over there?

181
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,430
Is that the hidden item?

182
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,550
Wait, I think I can go down here too, though.

183
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,010
Can I?

184
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,430
Oh, sorry.

185
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,170
He's so thick, he bounced.

186
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:16,290
Oh, my God.

187
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,630
There's so much down here.

188
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,310
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

189
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:22,630
Wow!

190
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:23,270
Oh.

191
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:27,300
Ah!

192
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,080
Oh, good job, Snake.

193
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,880
He didn't crash.

194
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,140
He didn't crash and die this time.

195
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,180
Okay.

196
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,580
Thank you, Joshua.

197
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,100
I can't read it right now.

198
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,820
We have 24 seconds, you guys.

199
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,700
I don't think we're gonna make it.

200
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:53,900
Nice.

201
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,100
Good job, Snake.

202
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,260
We'll come back for that.

203
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:58,860
Oh.

204
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,800
What?

205
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,440
Oh my god.

206
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,260
Oh my god.

207
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,720
Oh my god.

208
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,360
What kind of mode was that?

209
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,670
A D, no way.

210
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,310
I didn't get a single man.

211
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,390
It's okay.

212
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,810
Don't scream while falling feels anticlimactic.

213
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,550
I like the way he kind of like flails his arms a little bit.

214
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,270
Did you guys hear that?

215
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,610
His little, oh, oh, oh.

216
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,070
Oh gosh.

217
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,270
Do I have to do it?

218
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,190
Wait, how fast do I have to go?

219
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:07,950
No way!

220
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,150
No way!

221
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,710
Body burial.

222
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,230
Body burial.

223
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,310
Okay.

224
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,130
Oh, it's still alive!

225
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:17,930
Uh-oh.

226
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,210
Nice.

227
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:23,750
Nice.

228
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,050
50-50 grind.

229
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,270
Oh, it's still alive.

230
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,390
Oh, ow!

231
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,510
Oh god, we're bleeding!

232
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:38,310
Blue, British Whisp catching a stream for once, not a bot!

233
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,230
Thank you!

234
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,890
Sorry, I do plan on doing more, um, come on, Snake.

235
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,150
More, uh, EU-friendly streams.

236
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,710
Oh, that's a bird.

237
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,610
Okay, Snake, we need to get you up here.

238
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,350
Oh!

239
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,150
Ah!

240
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,010
Nice.

241
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,430
I should be more careful.

242
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,950
My bad.

243
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,190
Okay, let's go up here.

244
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,210
Here we go.

245
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,410
Nice!

246
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,530
Wow, this is actually huge.

247
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,050
Do a kick flip.

248
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,250
He listened so well.

249
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,450
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

250
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,970
That should have been easy.

251
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,310
Three out of four?

252
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,210
Nice.

253
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,250
Where's the last one, I wonder?

254
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:34,550
Nice.

255
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,020
How do I grab?

256
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,060
Oh, I stuck it!

257
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,580
I stuck it!

258
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,120
I stuck it!

259
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:45,640
Oh!

260
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,250
Uh, let's go back downstairs, I guess.

261
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:58,770
Nice.

262
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,530
There's some stuff over here.

263
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:00,950
here.

264
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:03,210
Snake!

265
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:03,670
Ah!

266
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,430
Yeah, let's make the sound effect ourselves when we die,
right?

267
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,270
Okay, but how the heck?

268
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,330
Show us some tricks!

269
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:17,870
Come on!

270
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:18,830
Come on!

271
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,550
Okay, we completed one mission!

272
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,230
We just gotta keep going!

273
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:28,930
Nose!

274
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,710
Okay, Snake.

275
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,190
Grab it!

276
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,410
Oh!

277
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,670
Oh my god!

278
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,450
Yo, yo, yo, you got so many.

279
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:38,930
Oh!

280
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:40,490
Ah!

281
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,650
Woo!

282
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,070
Woo!

283
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:45,170
Oh!

Okay.

Bro.

317
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
Do you remember what day it is on April 30th?

318
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,080
Yeah, it's the day my dude Snake did a 1080 double ollie and
grind.

319
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,760
Dude is bodaciously radical and righteous.

320
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,420
Rose?

321
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,220
Oh my gosh.

322
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,440
Oh, I stuck that.

323
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,220
That was so crazy.

324
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,860
We got all four dog tags.

325
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,460
I want to blow up the plant.

326
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,000
Okay, that's going to be our goal right now.

327
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,560
It's figuring out how to blow up the plant.

328
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,020
I want to cause violence.

329
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,080
Oh, is it that over there?

330
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,520
No, hold on.

331
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,280
Oh, snake, turn around.

332
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,200
Oh, snake, you're doing awesome.

333
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,700
Oh, ah!

334
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,300
What a shame indeed.

335
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,720
Choose violence.

336
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,600
Let's go downstairs.

337
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,960
Let's see if we can find how to blow up.

338
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,160
Wait, can you stop for a second's sake so I can look around?

339
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,100
Maybe over there.

340
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,940
Oh, sorry.

341
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,500
Oh, sorry.

342
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:45,700
Uh-oh.

343
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,620
Was that what I think it was?

344
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,900
Oh, wow!

345
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,640
Oh my gosh.

346
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,380
Oh my god, we made it!

347
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:52,640
Oh!

348
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,320
Um.

349
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:58,840
Whoa!

350
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,140
Oh god.

351
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,940
Oh, snake, get out of here, snake it out.

352
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:05,860
Snake.

353
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,200
There we go.

354
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,100
No, no, no, no.

355
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,360
Snake.

356
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,520
Okay, this way.

357
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,460
Never mind.

358
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,380
Okay.

359
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,920

I wonder if there's a way to get more time.

364
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,120
There's not much point being here if you don't do any trick.

365
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,020
Shut up!

366
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,720

367
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,800
Okay, Snake.

368
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:13,320
Jump.

369
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,460
Jump.

370
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,200
Don't do it!

371
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,680
Just trying to turn around.

372
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,380
I'm just... There we go.

373
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,400
Check the other side.

374
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,360
Like, yeah, let's try this side.

375
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,140
Hua!

376
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,060
Oh wait, we need this!

377
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:34,480
Wait.

378
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,080
Oh, you're... I think we need this part.

379
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,100
Okay, hold on.

380
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,280
Oh, hold on.

381
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,620
Snake.

382
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,120
Turn around.

383
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,020
Turn around, Snake.

384
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,300
Snake.

385
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:44,360
Ouch.

386
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,460
Oh my god!

387
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,340
Looking good, he said.

388
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,460
Oh!

389
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:06,900
Interesting.

390
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:09,720
dead anyway.

391
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:16,780
Okay, so once we get that, how do I still have a D?

392
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,340
Okay, then we have to go get the other ones.

393
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,220
Looking good.

394
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,120
I'm a disaster.

395
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,880
Yeah, this is a disaster.

396
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,960
Look at that.

397
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,000
That's so sick.

398
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:33,720
Look at that.

399
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,800
Look at him go.

400
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,120
Don't look at that.

401
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,920
Don't look at that part.

402
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,940
Let's try and replay.

403
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:41,900
I wonder.

404
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,360
You're killing it, dude.

405
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:47,780
Go!

406
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Go!

407
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,800
Uh-oh, I don't think I killed him.

408
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,720
I don't think I killed him.

409
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,640
Oh,

410
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,990
it shows the video of what I did.

411
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,030
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

412
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,490
Oh my god.

413
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,850
Oh, I made it.

414
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:13,630
How did I make it?

415
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,510
How did I make it?

416
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,010
Oh!

417
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:16,630
Oh!

418
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,550
Snake, don't do it.

419
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,490
Okay, Snake, I need you to just turn around, buddy.

420
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,270
Very slowly.

421
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:24,890
There you go.

422
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,230
Okay.

423
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:29,980
Yeah!

424
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:31,700
Okay.

425
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,920
No, please.

426
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,420
Snake, turn around.

427
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,480
We need some.

428
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,080
We need some.

429
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:39,540
Oh, wait.

430
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,540
Let's go to this one real quick.

431
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,020
Whoa!

432
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:46,960
Oh!

433
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,080
We made it, we made it, we made it, we made it.

434
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,100
Okay, there we go, there we go.

435
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,800
Where are those?

436
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:53,840
Oh, snake.

437
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:54,920
Oh, my God.

438
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,980
He gets a little, he gets a little out of control, you know?

439
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:01,900
Okay.

440
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,120
Nice.

441
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,480
Yeah.

442
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:09,620
Nice.

443
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,690
Oh, my God.

444
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,670
Guys, I'm killing it.

445
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:24,490
Nice.

446
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:24,990
Oh.

447
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:26,430
Almost had it.

448
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,250
Almost had it.

449
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,370
I think it's on this side.

450
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:37,950
Let's go and destroy our side-out gear.

451
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,090
Wow!

452
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,130
Okay, now where the other one is, I don't know.

453
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,970
Uh, wait, now that's a door.

454
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,390
Keep going.

455
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:48,830
Upstairs maybe?

456
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,150
You think it's upstairs maybe?

457
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,550
Is this David Hater VAing?

458
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,290
I wish.

459
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,470
Shut up!

460
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,210
I'm going!

461
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,150
Oh, there it is.

462
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,270
He

463
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,600
dead?

464
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,200
Wait.

465
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,640
Wait!

466
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,180
Where is that?

467
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,240
Oh, got a dog tag.

468
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,600
Oh, oh, ouch.

469
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:41,980
Ouch, ouch.

470
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,420
Come on, Snake.

471
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:44,860
Get it back up.

472
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:45,760
Oh, my God.

473
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,460
No, no, don't get me again.

474
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:54,970
Mission completed.

475
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:02,490
Okay, let's do a little celebratory grab or that, whatever
the hell that was.

476
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,530
Oh my God, are you okay, Snake?

477
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,890
He's fine, he's fine.

478
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:17,170
I wonder if the hidden is like, get all the birds or
something, you know, something crazy like that.

479
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:20,490
Nice!

480
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:24,370
Oh!

481
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,730
We almost had it.

482
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,550
Still a D!

483
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,820
This makes me want to see you play the original Tony Hawk's
game and Tony Hawk's Underground.

484
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,860
You should be more careful.

485
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,080
That's so awesome!

486
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,860
That sound is so great.

487
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,340
Wait, hold on, I'm gonna see it next.

488
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,020
If we do replay, let's see.

489
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,260
Oh, yeah, you're right.

490
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,520
Slow.

491
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,760
Oh, yeah.

492
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,940
Oh, my God.

493
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:07,540
Wow.

494
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,280
How do I go fast?

495
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:11,580
Oh.

496
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,980
Wait, no, no, no, back, back, back, back.

497
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,360
I went.

498
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:18,740
Yeah!

499
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,860
And then...

500
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,240
Slow...

501
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,100
Oh, no, snake.

502
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:33,740
And then I stood there trying to turn around.

503
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,010
Frame advance.

504
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:49,830
Oh wow, we could get like frame perfect shots.

505
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:55,470
Yeah!

506
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,070
Yeah!

507
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,550
I think he's a pro.

508
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,530
It's okay, he lived.

509
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,230
It's okay.

510
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,290
It's me trying to do the setup.

511
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,270
It's killing me.

512
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,580
L1 is slow, right?

513
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,180
It doesn't feel very slow.

514
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,440
Yeah!

515
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,660
Oh my gosh, we went crazy there.

516
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,300
Oh, God.

517
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:39,740
Yeah!

518
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,900
Oh, and then I fell off.

519
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,380
That's okay.

520
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,460
Surprise, they didn't include Fat Man on his rollerblades
for this.

521
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:47,920
Right!

522
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,860
It would have been perfect.

523
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,180
Oh, I'm crying.

524
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,620
I'm crying from laughing so much.

525
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,480
It only has been a half hour.

526
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,520
This game is kind of cruel, though.

527
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,080
They give you... Oh, okay.

528
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,360
Oh, oh, I clicked restart.

529
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,260
Oh, no.

530
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:19,800
They only give you like so few times, so few minutes.

531
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,100
Thank you, diving.

532
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,380
Could you perhaps, my chance be untubular?

533
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,100
Absolutely not.

534
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,880
I am the most tubular.

535
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,960
Ghost man you'll ever meet.

536
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,340
There's one thing.

537
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,060
You'll find it hard to believe.

538
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,160
I saw a man grinding on a skateboard on the connecting half
pipe to Shell 2.

539
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,520
I've seen someone use that box strip before.

540
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,380
We'll lay a trap on Shell 2.

541
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,540
Connecting half pipe.

542
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,880
There he goes.

543
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,900
Okay, retry.

544
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,860
How many, how much time do we have?

545
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,680
Three minutes?

546
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,080
Bodifarion.

547
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,560
Bodifarion.

548
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,980
Oh, no snake.

549
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:17,840
Jump.

550
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,020
Nose grab.

551
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,120
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

552
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,480
No, no, no, no, no.

553
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:25,740
Dang it.

554
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,440
We got it though.

555
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,560
We got it though.

556
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,220
Nice.

557
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,060
How do we get the ones up there?

558
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:31,560
What?

559
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,500
I want... Oh, sorry, snake.

560
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,020
I also want the stuff back there.

561
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:36,680
Okay.

562
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,560
Go, snake.

563
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,000
No, go.

564
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:41,940
Hoorah!

565
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,660
Impossible!

566
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,580
We make the impossible possible.

567
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,300
I have to, I have a feeling that the...

568
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,900
That the birds have something to do with the hidden one.

569
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,520
Oh, nice.

570
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,180
Nice.

571
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,020
Not today.

572
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,120
Cipher!

573
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,460
Ouch!

574
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,280
Why are you still shooting me?

575
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,920
This is good, isn't it?

576
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,220
Can you imagine what big boss would think?

577
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,480
Oh yeah, let's go.

578
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,100
Let's go blow up.

579
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,220
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.

580
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,320
Okay.

581
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,700
Oh, nicer!

582
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,420
Oh, snake, snake, jump.

583
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,140
There we go.

584
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,220
Yeah.

585
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:39,880
Yeah!

586
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,240
Big boss would be like, that's my son.

587
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,020
Oh, no!

588
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,580
I was not a lion.

589
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,080
It's okay.

590
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,820
50-50 grunt!

591
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,420
This remix is awesome.

592
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,060
Oh, what the- what's going on?

593
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,440
My son.

594
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,740
Oh, no!

595
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,580
Stay here!

596
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,660
Nose grind.

597
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,780
Grind mission completed!

598
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,670
Here's the true mission.

599
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,310
The true challenge.

600
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:36,560
Ah!

601
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,240
Ugh.

602
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,980
We only have 30 seconds, Snake.

603
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,620
We gotta get...

604
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,700
We gotta get Destroying.

605
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,520
I'm trying!

606
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,440
I'm trying, sir!

607
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,540
Please.

608
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,540
Snake!

609
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,220
Yes, yes, yes.

610
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,680
Nice!

611
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,000
Okay, okay, okay.

612
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Let's go get the first one.

613
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,320
Come on, Snake.

614
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,760
Come on, we got this.

615
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,420
Right here, right here, right here, right here.

616
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,960
Right here!

617
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,080
Don't try too hard.

618
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,620
Don't try too hard.

619
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,400
Oh, oh, oh no, we don't have the time!

620
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,420
Go, Snake, go!

621
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,120
I don't think we're gonna make it.

622
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,840
Oh, we're not gonna make it.

623
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,260
Ugh.

624
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,100
Don't try too hard.

625
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,620
We only got one in the end.

626
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,880
Actually, it says there's four.

627
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,100
It says there's four.

628
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,480
Four ciphers, but...

629
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,300
But I only saw three.

630
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
We gotta go find the last one.

631
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,100
Retry.

632
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,460
Let's go try it.

633
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,540
Let's go find the last one.

634
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,300
Hmm.

635
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,220
A board to surpass Metal Gear.

636
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,060
We didn't take him out, but that's...

637
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:11,480
Okay.

638
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:12,980
This way.

639
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,840
Oh my god.

640
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,900
How am I supposed to do this?

641
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,920
No way.

642
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,600
Wait, do I go, like, from up here?

643
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,580
Ooh, we made it.

644
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,020
We lived.

645
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:37,840
Okay.

646
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:39,740
Okay,

647
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:46,880
hold on.

648
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,620
We need some...

649
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,360
Oh, we need some air.

650
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:50,940
We need some air.

651
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,520
We need some...

652
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:51,800
Here we go.

653
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,180
Here we go.

654
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,800
Okay, from here, from here.

655
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,120
And jump!

656
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,680
Snake, why don't you jump?

657
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,040
Why don't you jump, Snake?

658
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,240
Why?

659
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,180
There's not much point being here that don't do any tricks.

660
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:11,820
Jump!

661
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,190
I think it's jump and release.

662
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:38,890
the release okay like I think it's okay like this jump okay

664
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,950
and jump at the same time?

665
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,450
It's like that in Tony Hawk, too.

666
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:00,650
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

667
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:03,850
Jump off.

668
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:04,730
Oh, wait.

669
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,380
Oh, so close.

670
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,500
You're so close.

671
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:16,940
Good jump.

672
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,600
No, how am I supposed to jump?

673
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:35,780
Oh, my gosh.

674
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,520
We're going to get this.

675
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,300
We're going to get this.

676
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,800
This is what we'll practice.

677
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,860
Okay, here we go.

678
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,460
I'm holding... I'm holding...

679
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:43,760
Jump!

680
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,870
Grind on the handrail instead.

681
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:57,330
Hmm.

682
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,950
There's no way I should keep getting a D.

683
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,170
Okay, let's go back to that spot.

684
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:04,940
Let's go back to that spot.

685
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:07,990
Jump.

686
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:12,590
Yeah.

687
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:14,210
Okay.

688
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:15,850
Oop!

689
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:30,110
I pressed the wrong line.

690
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,080
Okay,

691
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:47,580
okay, okay.

692
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,200
I think I get the timing.

693
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,480
Oh my god.

694
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,020
Alright, here we go.

695
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,620
Turn around.

696
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,460
Go.

697
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,090
This is so tricky.

698
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:10,670
It's okay.

699
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,930
Snake, you got this.

700
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,510
You got this, buddy.

701
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:21,280
Fine, what it's doing!

702
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,060
Hold on.

703
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,040
Okay, hold on.

704
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,220
Too early might be better than too late.

705
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,480
Hold on.

706
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,620
If I'm grinding, grind, grind, grind on there.

707
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,480
Okay.

708
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,480
Okay, okay.

709
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,760
I'm shredding.

710
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,560
I'm shredding.

711
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,020
I'm shredding.

712
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:42,400
I'm shredding.

713
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,220
We got this!

714
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:46,780
Dude!

715
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,880
I was a little off on my calculations.

716
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,390
We have a whole minute to learn this.

717
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:04,690
Oh!

718
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,710
This guy is getting on my nerves.

719
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,270
How is it so funny every time?

720
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,790
It's the way he flails his arm, you know?

721
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:18,370
Alright, here we go, here we go.

722
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:20,610
Why?

723
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:21,350
Why?

724
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:21,610
Why?

725
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,890
When I'm off, sometimes he catches it.

726
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,930
Other times, he doesn't catch it.

727
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:30,370
Okay.

728
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:32,190
There we go.

729
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,610
Please show us some tricks.

730
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,200
Please do something.

731
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:39,370
Okay.

732
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:40,150
Down.

733
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:40,450
Ah!

734
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:41,370
What?

735
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:42,770
Okay, you guys?

736
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,070
I...

737
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,790
I... I was holding X the whole time!

738
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:53,750
Okay, okay.

739
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:56,850
Oh, look!

740
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:00,750
Okay, that one I was not holding X.

741
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:06,250
But did you release X?

742
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:07,430
No, I did!

743
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:10,310
You can't see my hat!

744
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:11,650
Actually, you can see my hands.

745
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:13,890
But my hands are shredding right now.

746
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:17,470
I'm focused on my own grind, okay?

747
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,070
Okay.

748
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,670
Are you playing through OBS?

749
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:49,570
Oopsie!

750
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,400
Ta-ching!

751
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,980
I basically, that was like a hoop though.

752
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:04,300
Come on.

753
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,020
How do you land that?

754
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:13,600
Come on, Snake.

755
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:22,290
All you did was jump!

756
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:24,910
Oh my god.

757
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:25,830
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

758
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,550
Bomb rush cyberpunk.

759
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:33,690
I don't

760
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,760
even see what it was!

761
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,180
What was the hidden?

762
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,500
Where's the...

763
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,720
I'm trapped here.

764
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,000
Oh.

765
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,980
I'm trapped here, you guys.

766
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:55,300
Uh-oh.

767
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:55,720
No snake.

768
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,100
Turn around.

769
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:56,480
Turn around.

770
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:00,160
No.

771
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:09,940
No.

772
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,480
That's a disappointment.

773
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,820
What was the thing on it?

774
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,720
Okay, here we go.

775
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,300
Oh, come on Snake.

776
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,820
We need you to catch some...

777
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:31,950
I did not press X soon enough, that was mean.

778
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,550
It's all mean.

779
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:35,970
It's okay though, we got it one time, we can get it again.

780
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:37,030
This is it.

781
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,340
What?!

782
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,740
I held X, you game.

783
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,160
You game, I held X.

784
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,420
Fifty-fifth.

785
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:55,500
Two!

786
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:58,820
No, please.

787
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,400
Please, I held X and I let go.

788
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,180
This is so messed up.

789
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,900
This is so messed up, Stank.

790
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,540
Okay, come on.

791
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,300
Why not grind on the rails outside?

792
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,520
Instead of jumping?

793
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,280
Because you have to hear...

794
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,200
Because they cut off.

795
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,080
You have to do it.

796
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,640
Oh, unless you mean like...

797
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,640
Okay, I think I...

798
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,580
So like controlling it to go to the...

799
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,900
Okay.

800
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,460
I think I know what you mean.

801
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:36,380
I think I know...

802
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,080
Hold on, let me see.

803
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:38,640
I think...

804
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,640
I think I get what you're saying.

805
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,620
I think I'm catching what you're putting down.

806
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,500
I think I'm understanding the gravity of the situation.

807
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,480
Oh god.

808
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,220
I think I got it.

809
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,120
I think I know what you mean.

810
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,180
I'm gonna try it.

811
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,040
No guarantee you so.

812
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,340
Like so here And then oh I won't let it.

813
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,760
Unless it's like pitch perfect.

814
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,980
I don't know about that one.

815
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:07,840
I don't know about that one.

816
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,280
Yeah, I don't...

817
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:31,650
What's over here too?

818
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:35,890
Alright, snake!

819
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:50,610
But slowly, slowly, slowly, snake, slowly.

820
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:52,630
Don't, you don't want to die here.

821
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,190
Snake, snake.

822
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:57,130
Looking good!

823
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:04,450
Why can't I, why can't I grab it?

824
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:06,210
What?

825
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:08,730
Um...

826
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:10,250
What?

827
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,550
Okay, I think it's, uh, bugged maybe.

828
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,000
Nice.

829
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,180
Oh.

830
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,220
Ah!

831
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,480
We got this guy.

832
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,200
Oh!

833
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:30,930
Do I have a health?

834
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:31,370
I wonder.

835
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,470
Oh, we almost made it.

836
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:35,330
No, no, Snake!

837
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:36,330
Snake, don't die!

838
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,430
Phantom coin.

839
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:43,390
Okay.

840
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:49,940
Oh!

841
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,440
Almost.

842
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,500
Oh!

843
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:03,480
No!

844
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:09,620
I don't think it read the input.

845
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,020
Happy Big Shell Day!

846
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:12,920
Happy!

847
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:14,760
Whoa!

848
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,460
Big Shell Day, everybody!

849
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,800
Yeah!

850
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:31,840
Whoa!

851
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,320
Yes!

852
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,020
A deal!

853
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,360
After all of that, still, we get the big D.

854
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,040
It's a hind D.

855
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,060
A hind D.

856
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,760
Let's check out Ryden's.

857
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,200
End game.

858
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:10,700
That was a good run, though.

859
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:11,400
Good run, everybody.

860
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:11,920
Wait.

861
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:12,600
Oh, wait.

862
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,480
Oh, I just realized my bad.

863
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,540
I thought...

864
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:17,500
I don't know what I thought.

865
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,620
Sorry, my...

866
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,780
My place, PS2, is going kind of crazy.

867
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,980
Minty is ready for the X games.

868
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,160
2!

869
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,680
Hope you're having a totally gnarly April 30th and enjoying
the FGS skateboarding.

870
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:36,100
The full game is playable Grelukovic soldiers, Simon
Belmont, Frogger the Frog, and boss battles against enemies

871
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:36,700
like Dracula.

872
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,680
Plus it's fun having snakes skate in Tokyo.

873
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:39,640
Yeah!

874
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:40,860
Oh my gosh!

875
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,340
Split stream Sam.

876
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,020
Looking pretty rad, boss.

877
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,500
Thanks.

878
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:56,720
is this this is how george washington always wanted us to
commemorate today don't you agree this is actually how we

879
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:06,720
crossed the delaware river i didn't know if you knew that i
didn't i didn't know that that guy mr washington i hope

880
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:18,160
you're watching this is what you fought for this is what
makes us free the right to skate wherever we please oh it

881
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,440
would have been so cool I had blown up the...

882
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,360
Okay, let's try it.

883
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,520
I wonder if there's a blow-up one for Ryzen 2.

884
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,680
So this is Route B.

885
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:26,400
I wonder...

886
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,680
So I guess it's different.

887
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:29,440
Two!

888
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:35,520
Prognosticatura.

889
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,640
Mint has to nerf herself through OBS because she would be
too good.

890
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,240
I finally figured out how to do it, though.

891
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,460
Operate the crane.

892
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,260
Collect four rations.

893
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,860
Wait, is there less stuff for Ryzen?

894
00:52:48,880 --> 00:53:07,200
than there is for snake where am I crazy 8,000 points Ryan

Raiden?

898
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,500
Oh, he's serving.

899
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,020
Look at him.

900
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,860
Rations instead of dog tags.

901
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:37,060
Go!

902
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,120
I see a ration right over here.

903
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,080
Oh, I keep...

904
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:48,340
Whoa, look at there's a whole place here for us to grind.

905
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:49,420
Tailslide.

906
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,520
Tailslide.

907
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,620
There it is.

908
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,760
Oh, oh, whoa, whoa.

909
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,040
Oh, dang it.

910
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,100
I don't think I destroyed it, though.

911
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:07,800
Ow!

912
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,660
Oh, God, right in your head.

913
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,180
Are you okay?

914
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,000
Oh, you almost had it.

915
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,600
It's time for Jack to let it kick.

916
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,280
You guys like that?

917
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:40,920
Err.

918
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,700
Riden, Riden.

919
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,540
Rules of Skater.

920
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,420
Thank you for the Hakusuma.

921
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,480
Oh my god, please.

922
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:01,610
Um, we'll just ignore that for now, okay?

923
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:02,910
Just kidding.

924
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:07,110
Justice has been served.

925
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:10,530
Nice.

926
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:11,570
It's okay.

927
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,030
We at least took him out.

928
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:15,890
We at least took him out.

929
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:18,350
Nice!

930
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:23,770
Doctor, turn off my skate inhibitors.

931
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:28,070
It's time for Jack.

932
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,470
Let her rip.

933
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,060
Come on, birds.

934
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,220
Oh, it almost had that skating here.

935
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:44,880
I realized.

936
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:48,740
Nice.

937
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,180
Almost had the body variable, but we at least killed the
thing.

938
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:57,630
Keep going, keep going.

939
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,070
Oh, so close.

940
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:00,150
So close.

941
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,290
Oh, I thought I was about to die.

942
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:06,790
Yeah!

943
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,920
That's the way, baby.

944
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,140
How do I destroy?

945
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:15,600
We'd be down.

946
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:15,980
Oh.

947
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,220
Whoa, we made that.

948
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,660
No, no.

949
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,940
I like destroying the boxes too.

950
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,020
Oh, yo!

951
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,260
We did that guy.

952
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,800
This is the crane, obviously.

953
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:38,760
Hmm.

954
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,520
We gotta figure out.

955
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,760
Let's see here.

956
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,820
Retry, retry, retry.

957
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,720
Go!

958
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,520
Let's do this first.

959
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,620
50, 50, 50.

960
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,520
Oh, I can never make it.

961
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:02,300
Oh my god.

962
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,720
Come on, come on, Ryden.

963
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:08,420
Nice!

964
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,620
I can never get the body barrier.

965
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:12,960
What?

966
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,340
What?

967
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:16,520
Was it,

968
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:25,180
Was it, you know, It's like, It's like, it's like, it's
like, it's like,

969
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:35,340
Of course they wanted to say kawaii instead of kawaii, you
know what I'm saying?

970
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:38,940
Oh no!

971
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,520
Impossible!

972
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:48,910
Even though I didn't get it.

973
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:49,290
Nice.

974
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:52,790
Wait, is the hidden spot in the same place?

975
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:54,450
No way.

976
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:05,850
That was sweet!

977
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:16,380
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, jojo, jojo, jojo,
jojo, jojo.

978
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:18,680
Oh, dang it.

979
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,520
Nice.

980
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,280
Took that guy out.

981
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,140
Nice.

982
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:30,760
Took that guy out.

983
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,560
I'm starting to get sweaty.

984
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:37,360
I'm shredding too much, dude.

985
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,040
I'm just...

986
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:39,840
Okay, here we go.

987
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,280
Oh no, I almost had it!

988
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:46,860
I forgot.

989
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:47,680
Okay.

990
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,400
It's not a disappointment.

991
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,400
My mom says...

992
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,520
I'm not a disappointment.

993
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:58,860
Okay, hold on.

994
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:03,540
Oh no, I jumped too early.

995
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,720
I jumped too early.

996
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:06,840
Denver!

997
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:08,900
Welcome.

998
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:14,690

00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:48,070
Not the hidden.

1011
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:49,550
Huh?

1012
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:52,330
That wasn't the hidden?

1013
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:54,950
Oh.

1014
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:15,710

Getting some sick air.

1017
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:44,850
Is this even possible?

1018
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:48,510
I don't know, let's go upstairs.

1019
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:50,950
Oh, come on.

1020
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:52,790
Ryden, you just, you have to push.

1021
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:55,490
Oh, is this it?

1022
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:00,300
Oh!

1023
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:02,740
There's the hidden!

1024
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:04,840
One out of, oh.

1025
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,420
That's a disappointment.

1026
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:12,750
Nice.

1027
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:15,010
Keep it going.

1028
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:16,430
It's right there, isn't it?

1029
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:19,670
Oh,

1030
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:24,760
I have to go downstairs and do it.

1031
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,920
Okay, erg.

1032
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,800
Oh, there's the other ration.

1033
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:31,120
Oh, we made it!

1034
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,240
Let's go.

1035
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,740
Wait, what does Circle do again?

1036
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,860
I can't remember what the difference between Circle and...

1037
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:46,540
Square.

1038
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,220
One of them's grab.

1039
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,560
One of them's something.

1040
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,220
How do you use your special?

1041
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,580
I have no idea.

1042
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,420
Circle is grab.

1043
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,080
Circle is grab tricks.

1044
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:00,880
Okay, okay, okay.

1045
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:09,200
I tried maybe like grabbing the side of it.

1046
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,780
It didn't really work.

1047
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:14,320
No, I didn't know.

1048
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,160
Oh, actually that works.

01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:27,840

1054
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,800
Oh, no.

1055
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:00,800
Oh, so close.

I want to get a C.

1058
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:12,490
Yes!

1059
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:15,170
That might be it.

1060
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:15,890
That might be C.

1061
01:03:16,570 --> 01:03:17,830
That might be a C, you guys.

1062
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:19,270
Can we get any more?

1063
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:22,610
Whoa!

1064
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,760
Are you kidding me?

1065
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:36,920

01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,880
Squidding me right now?

1069
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,860
Is it just D or...

1070
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:51,840
D or no D?

1071
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:52,860
You know?

1072
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,160
You have to get the D or else...

1073
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:04,780
or else is a C in my heart thanks f no it's a D don't make
it any lower

1074
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:19,000
because I'm not doing enough side tricks oh sorry sick
tricks actually though

1075
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:30,650
riding oh riding we gotta grind We get a score.

1076
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:32,810
What's the crash?

1077
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:35,790
Wait, what is...

1078
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:38,090
Oh, the probes.

1079
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:41,850
Look at the membership!

1080
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:42,450
Thank you!

1081
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:46,490
Score's too low.

1082
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:49,970
So maybe it doesn't have anything to do with the missions.

1083
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:52,630
Maybe it's all...

1084
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:59,520
Maybe it's more to do with the...

1085
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,040
There it is.

1086
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,680
our actual score.

1087
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:06,040
What if I just grind the whole time?

1088
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,700
There we go.

1089
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:15,120
Nice.

1090
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:18,460
Special R1.

1091
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:19,880
Can get you a lot of points.

1092
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,500
Oh, R1 is our special.

1093
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:26,980
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

1094
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:27,700
Okay.

1095
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:32,300
Also, I keep forgetting about this.

1096
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:34,020
We can flip in the air.

1097
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:34,580
Keep forgetting.

1098
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:38,440
Smooth!

1099
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:42,620
So we have to go upstairs first, right?

1100
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:44,560
So far so good.

1101
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:45,240
Ish.

1102
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:45,940
Come on, Ryden.

1103
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:53,190
Oh, I keep forgetting about L2 and R2.

1104
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,860
Oops, we did something there.

1105
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,280
Oh, oh no!

1106
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:00,780
Ryden!

1107
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,040
Ryden, go back, go back, go back.

1108
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,240
Minty's a real skater, not a poser, obviously.

1109
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:10,620
Oh, see?

1110
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,640
Only a real skater would have landed that.

1111
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,440
Okay, let's go back downstairs.

1112
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:27,440
Go right in.

1113
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:27,860
Right in.

1114
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:29,320
Wait, turn around.

1115
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:30,120
Oh, wait.

1116
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,760
Actually, yeah, I wanted to do that.

1117
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,640
Maybe I'm not, like, hitting enough of the...

1118
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:38,480
Or landing enough.

1119
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:40,080
Nice.

1120
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,160
I destroy the things, but I don't land the trick, you know?

1121
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:52,090
Come on.

1122
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:53,350
Let's go.

1123
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:55,290
And...

1124
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:56,310
Nice.

1125
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:02,210
Why does this game even have skateboarding?

1126
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:03,810
Why wouldn't it?

1127
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:10,590
Because MGS2 is the greatest of all time!

1128
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:13,690
I'm grinding up the stairs.

1129
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:16,210
grinding up the steps.

1130
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:19,670
Go, go, go.

1131
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:20,530
Come on, Ryzen.

1132
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:21,790
Go, go, go.

1133
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:23,590
Oh my god, please.

1134
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,760
Oh my god.

1135
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,400
That was close.

1136
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:34,580
Okay.

1137
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,580
Now we gotta get this ration.

1138
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:39,660
Wait.

1139
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:40,920
Does L2...

1140
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:41,080
Wait.

1141
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,320
Maybe L2 and R2 don't do anything.

1142
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,280
I'm trying!

1143
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,540
Oh my god, wait, no, please.

1144
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:53,100
Oh.

1145
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:55,620
Didn't I say though?

1146
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:57,240
What was the jump button again?

1147
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:57,920
It's X.

1148
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,580
That was, um...

1149
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:08,300
That was...

1150
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:11,780
You guys!

1151
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:15,590
We did it!

1152
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:17,730
We got the C!

1153
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:20,990
We did it!

1154
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:23,870
I actually feel like I was doing pretty well until the end
there.

1155
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:33,290
if i had collected if i had gotten that and then the score

degree see means degree yeah

1158
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:57,070
Seas get degrees.

1159
01:08:57,690 --> 01:08:58,810
That's the saying.

1160
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:04,270
Seas be degrees Celsius.

1161
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:11,270
Oh man.

1162
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:15,450
Absolutely.

1163
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:18,270
Sea means cool.

1164
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:20,290
I like the blowing.

1165
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:22,430
I actually think the snake's map was harder.

1166
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:24,110
I think it was more difficult.

1167
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:38,110
But maybe that means we can actually um complete all the
missions on this one who knows oh no no come on come on

1168
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:44,470

1171
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:01,710
Raiden!

1172
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:03,170
Raiden.

1173
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:07,630
So take care of the terrorists.

1174
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:10,730
You must grind.

1175
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:13,690
Oh damn.

1176
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:14,870
We didn't.

1177
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:15,910
He's gonna...

1178
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:17,190
He's gonna...

1179
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:18,150
Yeah!

1180
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:24,890
All according to plan, obviously.

1181
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:29,090
Nice!

1182
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:31,650
Nice!

1183
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:39,890
Oh no!

1184
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:41,130
I was so close.

1185
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:42,970
Just a deal.

1186
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:43,330
You know what?

1187
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:43,890
We got the money.

1188
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:44,830
We got the cash money.

1189
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:45,270
It's fine.

1190
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:46,730
Let's get out of here.

1191
01:10:47,130 --> 01:10:47,850
Let's go blow it.

1192
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:48,510
Let's not blow it.

1193
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:49,370
Let's go do a crane.

1194
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:52,370
Sick Kekaku, bro.

1195
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:56,010
Kickflip!

1196
01:10:56,010 --> 01:10:56,450
Kickflip!

1197
01:10:57,610 --> 01:11:00,370
Give us some extra points while we're...

1198
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:01,170
Oh!

1199
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:03,530
Oh, come on, Rydid.

1200
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:05,910
Come on, Rydid, Rydid.

1201
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:07,070
Okay, you know what?

1202
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:07,690
This works too.

1203
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:12,170
We gotta get the, we gotta get our grind on.

1204
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:15,890
We gotta get our grind on.

1205
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:23,700
Ouch.

1206
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,200
I missed that a little bit.

1207
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:28,060
No, that is not a solid snake.

1208
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,380
That's sick snake.

1209
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,260
Yeah!

1210
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:36,660
Looks like out of seven Uniques.

1211
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:37,600
What?

1212
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:48,460
Okay, all right, here we go.

1213
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,720
Did we land it, though?

1214
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:57,540
Did we land it?

1215
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:58,880
Did we land the impossible?

1216
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,500
That's so close!

1217
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,200
Ryden, Ryden, please turn around.

1218
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:06,480
Ryden, I can't see you.

1219
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:06,700
Okay.

1220
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,220
They don't call it the impossible for nothing.

1221
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:12,980
It's mostly for him.

1222
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:14,440
It's for his ego, you know.

1223
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:22,540
it the impossible but it's like the easiest trick ever
wouldn't that just make him feel really bad april 30th my

much point being here if you don't do any tricks um this one

1226
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,520
What an end.

1227
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:56,680
Truly.

1228
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:03,780
What an end.

1229
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:09,880
Lollilule.

1230
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:10,860
It's a Lollilule.

1231
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:11,880
It's a Lollilule.

1232
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:13,740
Lollilule.

1233
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,040
Lollilule.

1234
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,300
They're trying to stop me, the Lollilule.

1235
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,640
Oh, damn.

1236
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,160
That was so close.

1237
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:30,900
Please, Bryden.

1238
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,900
Get a bit of...

1239
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:33,680
Disaster.

1240
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:34,360
That's me.

1241
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,240
That's what they call me at the club!

1242
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:39,560
Disaster.

1243
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:40,460
Disaster.

1244
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:40,980
Disaster.

1245
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:42,340
Lallelu.

1246
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:43,440
Lallelu.

1247
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,460
What's up here?

1248
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,580
I haven't been here.

1249
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:48,180
Oh.

1250
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:49,420
Oh.

1251
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,040
Oh.

1252
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,700
I did not see that hole.

1253
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:53,720
Ha!

1254
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,280
Oh, dang it.

1255
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:55,680
Uh-oh.

1256
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:56,260
Uh-oh.

1257
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:56,980
We're in trouble.

1258
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:57,580
Ah!

1259
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:00,980
Don't shoot!

1260
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:01,460
Oh!

1261
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:02,440
Don't shoot!

1262
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:06,620
What club?

1263
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:13,960
Nice.

1264
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:16,600
Oh, so close.

1265
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,960
I also want to get these up here.

1266
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:24,280
Oh my god, that was so sick.

1267
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:26,960
He was shooting at me and I was...

1268
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:28,480
Yeah!

1269
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:35,360
He was shooting at me, but I was too busy Being awesome!

01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:39,000
Yeah, the club, obviously.

Oh, oh, oh, please, riding.

01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,400
Take the stairs now, riding.

1274
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,060
Here we go!

Yeah.

01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:01,620
Yeah, I do.

1279
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:05,000

Oh.

1286
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:57,290
Oh, sorry, Ryden.

1287
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:00,170
Why can't I get this?

1288
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:02,030
But it's so hard for me to get this ration.

1289
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:03,630
Oh my god.

1290
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:04,330
What?

1291
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:06,350
Why'd you stop, Ryden?

01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:07,430
Why'd you stop?

1293
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:10,470
Why'd you stop, Ryden?

1294
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:11,490
Why'd you stop?

1295
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:14,730
Uh...

1296
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:17,350
In the end...

1297
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:18,550
Everything is bad.

1298
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:22,790
I did one, I just did it!

1299
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:24,950
Come on, come on.

1300
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:25,770
Ration!

1301
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:33,530
We didn't get the grind either.

1302
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:39,510
I think getting the grind is like...

1303
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:41,450
Going...

1304
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:42,970
There and back.

1305
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:50,030
know what i mean okay like this nice

1306
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:57,090
oh why did you why did you fall

1307
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:13,370
so close that's okay though now we go around this way we
waste all this time and we hook we're going so slow oh my

1308
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:15,630
god right and don't do it don't write it

1309
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:22,170
We gotta grind everything we see.

1310
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:24,690
Like we're a bunny or something.

1311
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:29,730
Badass.

1312
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:31,930
Where's all the bird poop?

1313
01:17:32,370 --> 01:17:33,150
That's a good question.

1314
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,450
I took care of those birds.

1315
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:38,490
Nice.

1316
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:41,510
Oh, for some reason I keep thinking I gotta go back here.

1317
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:42,190
But I don't.

1318
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:42,810
Not yet.

1319
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:43,990
Not here yet.

1320
01:17:45,390 --> 01:17:46,210
Like you're a what?

1321
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:47,530
What do you mean?

1322
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,380
Oh, let's just pretend we don't see what.

1323
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,020
I didn't want those points.

1324
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:05,760
Anyway!

1325
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:23,970
Ryden, I need you to...

1326
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:24,670
I need you to...

1327
01:18:24,670 --> 01:18:26,270
You know, my money's on you.

1328
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:28,230
Ryden, Ryden, my money's on you.

1329
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:30,210
I need you to...

1330
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:31,270
Ryden, I'm gonna go broke.

1331
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:33,370
Ryden, don't you care about me?

1332
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:36,110
Oh, we got the grind at least.

1333
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:39,810
Ryden.

1334
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:42,090
Lock in, Ryden.

1335
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:43,310
Ryden.

1336
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:53,850
You know what?

1337
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:54,750
Let's just do this part.

1338
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:56,550
Oh, I don't think we're gonna make it!

1339
01:18:57,010 --> 01:18:58,220
I don't think we're gonna make it!

1340
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:02,710
I miss them in the game would just tell you you're bad.

1341
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:07,070
Ryden, that's a disappointment.

1342
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:13,350
Stop making me so sad!

1343
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:15,030
Oh, Ryden!

1344
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:16,910
Ryden!

1345
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:20,650
You're making Mike sad.

1346
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:28,240
You're making Mike sad.

1347
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,520
Oh, sorry, I just realized.

1348
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,720
I'm, I'm, I'm, my, my, my contacts.

1349
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:36,400
Okay, here we go.

1350
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,320
I hate this guy, I think.

1351
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,020
That's got to hurt.

1352
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:50,700
Okay.

1353
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:52,580
Oh my gosh, maybe.

1354
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:55,180
No!

1355
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:58,480
How do I get that one up there?

1356
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:02,640
How do I get that one up there?

1357
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:04,700
Ugh!

1358
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:10,120
C though, we got the C.

1359
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:12,240
We got the C.

1360
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:16,240
If I had just gotten that at the last second, maybe it would
have been a B.

1361
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:20,860
Jump?

1362
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:21,680
I've tried.

1363
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:22,640
Hold on, you know what?

1364
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:24,500
We're going to go practice that one right now.

1365
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:26,840
We're going to go straight to it and practice.

1366
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:29,820
This way.

1367
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:30,960
This way, this way.

1368
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:32,460
This way, this way.

1369
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,100
and

1370
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:52,310
if i jump well that obviously didn't work hold x and release
at the edge of the ramp no need to hold forward okay

1371
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:04,760
eyes are eyes are my man eyes are my man

1372
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:19,120
that was all you buddy Oh, oh, oh, there we go.

1373
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:23,620
Nice, so.

1374
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:26,060
Oh, I could not see.

1375
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:28,360
All right.

1376
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:30,820
Let's, um, oh.

1377
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,380
Oh my god, please.

1378
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:35,880
Oh.

1379
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:40,000
We wasted a little bit of time, but it's okay.

1380
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:43,260
Let's just feed.

1381
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,000
you cypher's.

1382
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:48,140
Ooh!

1383
01:21:49,060 --> 01:21:50,420
That hurt over here.

1384
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:51,800
Oh, is that right in?

1385
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:53,280
Right in.

1386
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:54,940
All we did was...

1387
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:56,120
All we did was turn around.

1388
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:05,810
All we did was turn around, man.

1389
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:07,530
Oh.

1390
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,250
Wait, which one's kickflip?

1391
01:22:22,030 --> 01:22:22,370
Wait.

1392
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:23,050
Oh, wait.

1393
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:31,200
Kickflip!

1394
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:34,400
It's a kick, and then it's a flip.

1395
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:39,930
Oh, wait.

1396
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:41,650
Oh, right in.

1397
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:42,570
Oh, right in.

1398
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:43,070
Right in.

1399
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:44,590
Right in.

1400
01:22:44,670 --> 01:22:44,670
Oh,

1401
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:52,650
gee, is this real?

1402
01:22:53,330 --> 01:22:55,430
You bet your butt it's real.

1403
01:22:56,770 --> 01:22:57,570
Went through our soak.

1404
01:22:57,950 --> 01:22:58,990
Whoa, what was that?

1405
01:22:59,570 --> 01:22:59,890
Come on.

1406
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:00,750
Oh, right.

1407
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:02,290
Oh, right.

1408
01:23:04,330 --> 01:23:05,050
Come on.

1409
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:06,150
Let's go, right in.

1410
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:08,590
What's stock one mean?

1411
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:10,610
Oh, didn't someone say...

1412
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:12,930
I can do like a special trick or something.

1413
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:15,110
Does that mean my special is stocked up?

1414
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:17,610
Huh.

1415
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:18,530
Oh.

1416
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:19,890
Wait.

1417
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:22,170
That's my special meter.

1418
01:23:24,090 --> 01:23:24,630
R1!

1419
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:26,310
Does nothing!

1420
01:23:26,690 --> 01:23:27,930
I got another stock!

1421
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:29,350
But how do I use it?

1422
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:31,090
Hmm.

1423
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:39,790
Nice.

1424
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:42,310
How do I use it?

1425
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:43,130
Hmm.

1426
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:49,250
Oh, I was gonna say, wait, I got the collection.

1427
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:50,450
No, we didn't at the beginning.

1428
01:23:50,970 --> 01:23:55,270
Okay, I think this time, for real, we can get the
collection.

1429
01:23:57,550 --> 01:24:00,530
If we can get a B for...

1430
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:09,230
Biden, ball, bake, burn, then I think we'll be good.

1431
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:11,430
Bows.

1432
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:14,070
Huh!

1433
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:20,200
Oh,

1434
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:24,300
dang it.

1435
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,700
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1436
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:27,700
Oh, no.

1437
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:29,960
Oh, gosh.

1438
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:31,500
Oh, yippee!

1439
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:37,480
B for blocks.

1440
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:41,140
B for...

1441
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:42,320
BJ!

1442
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44,520
Wait, no, no, no, never mind.

1443
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:47,180
I was thinking D for DJ, but...

1444
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:47,360
No!

1445
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,460
I didn't mean that!

1446
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:24,660
You guys know PD for DJ, right?

1447
01:25:37,650 --> 01:25:38,370
Whoa!

1448
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,840
Okay, I think I'm normal again.

1449
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:57,280
Yes.

1450
01:25:58,740 --> 01:25:59,100
No.

1451
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:04,780
You don't seem to have enough guts to 20- Yes, sir.

1452
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:07,720
No, sir.

1453
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,440
Oh, it's Ryden, please.

1454
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:12,940
We only have a minute, Ryden.

1455
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:18,430
There we go.

1456
01:26:19,570 --> 01:26:20,190
Yes, sir.

1457
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:21,530
No, sir.

1458
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:23,970
I cannot stop saying that.

1459
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:26,010
I think there's something wrong with my brain.

1460
01:26:26,170 --> 01:26:28,930
I can't just stop saying, Yes, sir.

1461
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:30,190
No, sir.

1462
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:33,590
Yes, sir.

1463
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:34,550
No, sir.

1464
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:44,060
Oh, gosh.

1465
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:46,400
Oh, no!

1466
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:48,140
Actually, this is okay.

1467
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:52,580
To thank you!

1468
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:54,380
Yeah!

1469
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:55,420
Oh, my God.

1470
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:56,340
Wait, you guys.

1471
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:58,780
I just need the score.

1472
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:02,300
I just need the score.

1473
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:20,460
No, no, no, no, please!

1474
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:22,960
Ryden, Ryden, don't do this to me!

1475
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:50,690
Oh, so close!

1476
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:54,690
Oh my gosh!

1477
01:27:55,530 --> 01:27:57,230
No, not B for BJ!

1478
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:01,910
Not B!

1479
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:05,830
But we got the B!

1480
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:08,410
Wee, wee, wee, wee!

1481
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:12,690
We got the B.

1482
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:22,270
Oh, you're making progress.

1483
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:23,130
Yeah, baby.

1484
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:27,510
Yeah, baby.

1485
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:30,850
Yes, sir.

1486
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:33,990
It takes a well-balanced individual to grind the rails.

1487
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:37,170
B for ghost booze.

1488
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:38,230
Boo, boo, boo.

1489
01:28:38,710 --> 01:28:40,690
Yeah, boo, boo.

1490
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:44,690
Oh, I'm sweating so much.

1491
01:28:44,770 --> 01:28:46,090
Do you guys mind if I go get some more water?

1492
01:28:47,330 --> 01:28:50,990
Here, you can watch the replay while I go get more water.

1493
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:52,350
I'll be right back.

1494
01:28:52,490 --> 01:28:53,420
Here, I'll even get rid of this.

1495
01:28:56,850 --> 01:28:57,310
BRB.

1496
01:28:58,690 --> 01:28:59,150
BRB.

1497
01:29:03,370 --> 01:29:03,830
BRB.

1498
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:04,870
Wait a second.

1499
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:07,110
I just joined the stream for the BJ.

1500
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:07,810
Wait, no!

1501
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:32,010
Wait, I might need to go change.

1502
01:30:32,570 --> 01:30:32,850
No!

1503
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,200
I'm my dress all wrinkly.

1504
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:40,140
Oh.

1505
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:51,080
I think I've sat weird and it's all rink right here.

1506
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:52,100
Oh no.

1507
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:55,080
Wait, I'm gonna go change.

1508
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:56,940
I'll be right back.

1509
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:57,920
Okay, again.

1510
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,360
BRV part two.

1511
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:00,280
So sorry.

1512
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:01,860
BRV part two.

1513
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:02,420
Hold on.

1514
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,580
I'm gonna restart it for those who missed it.

1515
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:06,560
Restart.

1516
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:07,560
There we go.

1517
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:08,620
All right, BRV.

1518
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,740
I have T-minus three minutes.

1519
01:33:02,990 --> 01:33:04,350
Into my shirt.

1520
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:05,890
Okay.

1521
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:07,250
I'm so sorry, you guys, I'm so sorry.

1522
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:09,950
Okay, okay, okay.

1523
01:33:10,890 --> 01:33:11,070
Exit.

1524
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:11,710
Alright.

1525
01:33:13,850 --> 01:33:17,950
I changed into my Hungry for Snake t-shirt.

1526
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:21,350
I realized I don't have any MGS 2 t-shirts.

1527
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:24,390
I have only MGS 3.

1528
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:28,390
Well, I have MGS 4, MGS 3, Peace Walker.

1529
01:33:32,010 --> 01:33:34,850
I didn't buy the one from Uniqlo because I didn't like it.

1530
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:41,670
The blue on it is so blue.

1531
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:44,050
It's so blue.

1532
01:33:46,030 --> 01:33:47,530
Like it's way too blue.

1533
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:49,430
I'll never wear it.

1534
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:52,390
I'll never wear it.

1535
01:33:53,530 --> 01:33:55,250
I do have one that says solidus on it.

1536
01:33:55,310 --> 01:33:56,470
Maybe I should have worn that instead.

1537
01:34:01,190 --> 01:34:02,590
Oh the fat man!

1538
01:34:03,670 --> 01:34:04,870
My laugh at growing.

1539
01:34:07,470 --> 01:34:08,650
Ah, yeah.

1540
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:10,390
Alright, guys.

1541
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:16,050
I...

1542
01:34:17,070 --> 01:34:18,750
Today's stream is actually going to be pretty short.

1543
01:34:22,190 --> 01:34:22,510
So...

1544
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:25,150
Um...

1545
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:26,750
How did you know I had that t-shirt?

1546
01:34:28,230 --> 01:34:29,230
Actually, it's not a t-shirt.

1547
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:30,090
But, you know.

1548
01:34:30,430 --> 01:34:32,710
How did you know I had a shirt that said laugh and grow bad?

1549
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:35,070
Is it because I love Fat Man so much, you knew?

1550
01:34:36,950 --> 01:34:39,390
Um, Min, do you know what day it is today?

1551
01:34:41,150 --> 01:34:42,350
April 30th?

1552
01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:45,290
It's Shredding Day!

1553
01:34:46,410 --> 01:34:47,730
Every MGS fan has it.

1554
01:34:47,810 --> 01:34:48,790
Oh, okay, okay.

1555
01:34:56,060 --> 01:35:03,860
But, I believe this is the round where we'll get an A for
that ass.

1556
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:04,560
Yeah!

1557
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:09,180
Let's go.

1558
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:10,640
Let's grind.

1559
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:24,360
all the way to dinner baby oh ouch uh that was not what I
expected um hey uh wait wait wait why are you facing this

1560
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:39,580

1561
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:41,540
oh Ew.

1562
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:45,480
Oh, ew, the camera.

1563
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:46,880
That's okay.

1564
01:35:58,490 --> 01:36:00,930
This should be you on this live stream.

1565
01:36:01,490 --> 01:36:02,110
Not me!

1566
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:03,430
Nice.

1567
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:15,590
Why do you not land the kickflips right in?

1568
01:36:16,650 --> 01:36:17,890
You're killing me.

1569
01:36:18,370 --> 01:36:21,110
You're tearing me apart, right in.

1570
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:29,050
That was so wet.

1571
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:30,330
Ryden.

1572
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:34,330
Hold on, I'm coming back over here to get...

1573
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:35,110
Oh, never mind.

1574
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:35,890
You know what?

1575
01:36:36,030 --> 01:36:36,450
Screw it.

1576
01:36:39,570 --> 01:36:40,530
Send in Grey Fox.

1577
01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:45,550
It's like when you play as Grey Fox in VR missions.

1578
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:52,860
I did!

1579
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:55,820
Ryden's bloody skin, Mark.

1580
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:57,720
What do you mean by that?

1581
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:00,840
Oh, my gosh.

1582
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:01,480
Oh, my gosh.

1583
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:03,400
I don't think this is the run, you guys.

1584
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:06,580
Um, uh-oh.

1585
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:08,080
Uh-oh.

1586
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:13,220
I don't know if this is the run, but we'll try.

1587
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,160
Oh, wrong way.

1588
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:16,200
Oh my gosh.

1589
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:20,120
We'll try.

1590
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:21,820
Oh.

1591
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:34,230
Okay.

1592
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:35,670
Come on.

1593
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:37,050
Oh, whoa, whoa.

1594
01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:38,970
All right, we'll go back up the stairs.

1595
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:51,140
I held on, but it...

1596
01:37:56,450 --> 01:37:56,930
Uh...

1597
01:37:56,930 --> 01:37:58,590
Well, we haven't even gotten that one.

1598
01:37:58,850 --> 01:38:00,370
Yo, this is not the run at all.

1599
01:38:00,910 --> 01:38:01,390
That's okay.

1600
01:38:03,530 --> 01:38:04,830
Good job, Ryden.

1601
01:38:07,030 --> 01:38:07,510
Nice.

1602
01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:08,510
Good job, Ryden.

1603
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:09,890
Turn around, Ryden.

1604
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:13,750
Ouch, ouch.

1605
01:38:16,030 --> 01:38:16,990
That's okay!

1606
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:18,730
That we didn't make it.

1607
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:19,430
That's okay.

1608
01:38:19,610 --> 01:38:20,130
That's okay.

1609
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:22,110
We didn't get the grind either.

1610
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:26,750
Yeah, we're getting consistencies though.

1611
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:28,010
Not so bad.

1612
01:38:28,670 --> 01:38:30,430
Okay, here we go.

1613
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:31,610
How

1614
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:43,140
do I use my special?

1615
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:48,380
Oh, if only I hadn't crashed, we would have made that.

1616
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,740
Ooh, this one's fancy.

1617
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:55,820
Nice.

1618
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:04,680
Nice.

1619
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:08,380
Nice.

1620
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:17,080
Okay.

1621
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:18,280
There we go.

1622
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:20,340
Speed run, speed run, speed run.

1623
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:25,740
Nice.

1624
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:28,700
Nice.

1625
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:31,220
Nice.

1626
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:34,860
Okay.

1627
01:39:36,860 --> 01:39:37,920
Kick flip.

1628
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:39,820
Kick flip, my beloved.

1629
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:50,010
Nice.

1630
01:40:01,150 --> 01:40:02,150
Oh, not nice.

1631
01:40:02,770 --> 01:40:04,970
You still need to grind though.

1632
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:07,830
Come on, ride it, ride it, ride it!

1633
01:40:09,110 --> 01:40:09,770
I know.

1634
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:10,950
I'm trying, I'm trying.

1635
01:40:11,270 --> 01:40:11,710
I'm trying.

1636
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:13,170
Mr. please.

1637
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:29,640

1639
01:40:50,190 --> 01:40:51,870
Let's go get these over here.

1640
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:59,620
I still have to make like a lot of points though.

1641
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:04,040
Tailslide!

1642
01:41:05,660 --> 01:41:05,780
Oh!

1643
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:07,780
Okay, that kid got us a lot.

1644
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:08,160
Nice.

1645
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:10,420
Let's just do it again.

1646
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:14,400
Yes!

1647
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:16,420
Yes!

1648
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:18,140
Yes!

1649
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:25,620
Oh, that works, that works, that works, that works.

1650
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:33,500
Oh no, oh no, no, no.

1651
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:34,060
Please.

1652
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:35,920
Oh,

1653
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:56,820
we did it!

1654
01:41:57,660 --> 01:41:58,820
Let's go!

1655
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:04,720
Oh my god!

1656
01:42:14,390 --> 01:42:17,590
April 30th!

1657
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:22,210
Yeah!

1658
01:42:23,890 --> 01:42:26,130
Oh my gosh!

1659
01:42:27,450 --> 01:42:29,190
Oh my gosh!

1660
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:41,780
You guys, it is time to do the final part of April 30th.

1661
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:46,340
While we watch...

1662
