1
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,220
Hey dudette.

2
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,400
Dude.

3
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,620

4
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,740
Are you gonna like pick that up?

5
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,960
I think they're like really trying to get in contact with you.

6
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,480
Are you like gonna pick that up?

7
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,540
Are you like gonna answer that?

8
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,610
Hey dude.

9
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,550
Hey dudette.

10
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,760
Um actually...

11
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,030
Um actually...

12
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,350
It was me.

13
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,190
I'm the one calling you.

14
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,810
And you need to pick up your phone.

15
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,010
Because it's shredding time.

16
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,920
It's time to get... groovy.

17
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,500
Welcome.

18
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,900
Welcome.

19
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,840
To not Metal Gear Solid 2.

20
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,920
Hey dude.

21
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,160
Hey dudette.

22
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,540
Do you know what day it is today?

23
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,800
Oh yeah.

24
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,760
Everybody salute.

25
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,610
Kosha!

26
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,590
Thanks for the 50k.

27
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,630
Thank you for the 50 gift.

28
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,290
Thank you!

29
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,090
It's April 30th my dude!

30
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,390
It's April 30th!

31
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,410
The most important day!

32
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:28,890
Yeah!

33
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,500
On this day!

34
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,120
My favorite couple in the world!

35
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,620
Shoutouts to you Jack and Rose!

36
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,700
They've met!

37
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,260
And then they went home and watched King Kong!

38
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,220
And history!

39
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,000
Was made!

40
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,880
So we're like gonna...

41
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,820
Celebrate that.

42
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,540
Hey man, did you know George Washington took office as the first president of the United States of America over 200 years ago today?

43
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,000
Today we're now the United Wisps of YouTubers!

44
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,140
Let's see.

45
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,220
So if you were unaware...

46
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,620
The...

47
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,840
Metal Gear Solid 2...

48
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,780
Substance...

49
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,980
Has a special little...

50
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,300
Extra...

51
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,340
Thing we got going on here.

52
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,540
If you could see at the very bottom.

53
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,920
Here's to you best boy and worst girl.

54
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
She's not the worst girl, come on.

55
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,520
Snakeboarding.

56
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,120
If you will.

57
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,540
Yes.

58
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,820
Snakeboarding.

59
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,240
So we'll be happier April 30th.

60
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,260
Happy April 30th!

61
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,240
Bluey Emmerich.

62
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,540
So worst.

63
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,320
The forgotten sibling of the Emmerichs.

64
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,400
What's wrong with BB?

65
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,000
B-B.

66
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,660
Skateboarding?

67
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,180
That's a thing?

68
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,820
Oh yeah.

69
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
It's only for...

70
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,820
Um...

71
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,280
It's only for MGS2 Substance.

72
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,080
So...

73
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,520
Um...

74
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,780
If you give it like the Master Collection...

75
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,180
Or anything like that.

76
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,480
It's not gonna be on there.

77
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,200
You gotta get...

78
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,460
MGS2 Substance for the PS2 baby.

79
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,480
I got my PS2 set up right over there.

80
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,640
I got my Retro Tink 4K all hooked up.

81
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,060
I'm ready.

82
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,900
I'm so ready.

83
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,620
To skateboard!

84
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,540
Um...

85
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,900
Honestly...

86
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:00,920
Um...

87
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,700
I can't say how long today's stream is gonna be because...

88
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,420
We could...

89
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:05,980
Um...

90
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,580
I think there's like not that much to do with this.

91
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,800
But um...

92
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
Yeah I...

93
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,440
I dropped some...

94
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:15,860
Okay.

95
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,500
Because I like was planning on doing a bunch of like...

96
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,400
You know...

97
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:19,960
Um...

98
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,480
PS2 games and stuff like that.

99
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,920
I kinda dropped the money on it.

100
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,480
So...

101
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,020
It's for your viewing pleasure everybody.

102
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,960
It's for your viewing pleasure.

103
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:29,960
You're welcome.

104
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,400
Oh thank you for the super chats you guys!

105
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,100
Um...

106
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,400
I totally thought about doing like a marathon.

107
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,080
For this stream.

108
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,120
You know...

109
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
Playing up...

110
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,920
Playing up to...

111
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,560
You know...

112
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,040
The game...

113
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,240
Or...

114
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,940
Like playing...

115
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,540
Marathoning the game or something.

116
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,820
But um...

117
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,200
Honestly...

118
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,080
I thought...

119
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,000
I kinda wanna save MGS2 again for when I properly replay the series.

120
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,180
So...

121
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,400
I didn't wanna replay it and have it on my channel and...

122
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,320
Or play it and have it on my channel and then replay it again.

123
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:06,900
Like...

124
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:07,740
Sometime...

125
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,320
Uh...

126
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,160
Down the line.

127
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,880
I don't know when.

128
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,640
So...

129
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Instead I was like...

130
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
Well what else can I do for April 30th?

131
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,200
And I was like...

132
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,860
Wait a second...

133
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,180
I know the coolest thing we could do.

134
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,920
Dude?

135
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,920
So...

136
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,140
Without further ado...

137
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,360
Oh...

138
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,680
Sorry...

139
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,560
You'll see the...

140
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,780
Everything kinda loading.

141
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,820
Feels so...

142
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,560
It feels so...

143
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,780
Old school, right?

144
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,380
Oh my gosh.

145
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,920
Game, are you okay?

146
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,760
Oh there we go.

147
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,390
Oh...

148
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,250
Yeah!

149
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,690
Raiden...

150
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,290
To disarm the terrorists...

151
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,630
You must...

152
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,390
Shred on Arsenal gear.

153
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,470
Raiden...

154
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,310
To save America...

155
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,150
Do...

156
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,090
Your...

157
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:15,990
Best...

158
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,850
And...

159
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,410
Ollie...

160
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,150
I don't know.

161
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,440
Welcome everybody to MGS2!

162
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,620
Let's see...

163
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,300
Controller...

164
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,260
We got Ollie...

165
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,000
Small jump...

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,860
Hold the button to crouch and release to jump.

167
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,900
That's the X button.

168
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,480
Simple enough, dude.

169
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,680
We got this, dude.

170
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,280
We can grind...

171
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,580
Rail slide...

172
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,140
Jump on a rail, etc.

173
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,260
And hold down the triangle button to grind.

174
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:48,980
Oh...

175
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,980
Yeah...

176
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,180
Raiden...

177
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:51,400
Raiden...

178
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,960
Flips and grabs are done in mid-air.

179
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,760
A series of tricks can be done until you reach the ground.

180
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,440
Got it, dude.

181
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:03,740
Oh...

182
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,940
We need those six...

183
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,040
Six flips, boss.

184
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,660
I got you.

185
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,260
Can't wait for Raiden to activate roller blade mode.

186
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,240
Raiden...

187
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,900
Do spins by turning while in mid-air.

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,120
Okay.

189
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,760
L2 and R2 are spin.

190
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,560
We got...

191
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,520
Grab is circle.

192
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,220
Flip is square.

193
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,000
Umm...

194
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,820
I probably won't remember any of these.

195
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,320
Take a dupe on your board.

196
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,740
No!

197
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,320
Don't do that.

198
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,360
Don't dupe on the board.

199
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,040
Duping is uncool on the board.

200
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,920
Good morning, Mint.

201
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,760
Good morning.

202
00:11:52,600 --> 00:12:00,820
A little pause... and we are back.

203
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,360
Oh my gosh, no way.

204
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,540
Hold on, let me go back real quick.

205
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,660
Okay, ollie, grind...

206
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,820
Flip and grab.

207
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,560
Flip and grab.

208
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,960
Flip, grab.

209
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,620
Flip, grab.

210
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,540
Grind, grind.

211
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,880
Ollie, ollie, ollie, ollie.

212
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,140
Ollie, ollie, ollie, ollie.

213
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,480
Time for a stream.

214
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:51,100
Also, I finally saved up the last five dollars I owned... I owned the Canadian Mafia stuff.

215
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,260
These DMV photos...

216
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,560
They don't even look like them.

217
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,580
Like, what are these models?

218
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,760
They look so strange.

219
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,620
Who should we start as?

220
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,640
Should we start as Raiden because it's his big day?

221
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,360
Or should we start as Snake and finish with Raiden because it's Raiden's big day, everybody?

222
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,560
No, that is not solid.

223
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,220
Snake Skateboard.

224
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,740
Snake first?

225
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,260
Alright.

226
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,200
Now loading.

227
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,260
Okay, here we go, baby.

228
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,740
Alright, ollie, grind.

229
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,160
Oh, I don't remember which one's flip and which one's grab.

230
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,520
Alright.

231
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,940
Mission information.

232
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,180
Snake.

233
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,260
Score 8,000 points.

234
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,240
Find the hidden item.

235
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,640
Grind 150 meters.

236
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,860
Collect four dog tags.

237
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,220
Destroy all three uninhabited probes.

238
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,140
Blow up the plant.

239
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,320
Squares flip.

240
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,040
Okay, thank you.

241
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,480
Here we go.

242
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,480
Oh, yeah.

243
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,520
Oh!

244
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,620
No, it's so awesome.

245
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,060
Oh my god, we're grinding first.

246
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,800
No, no, no, no, no.

247
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,400
Oh, I got caught.

248
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,060
Oh my god.

249
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:26,780
No, no, no, no.

250
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,400
And we're gonna grab.

251
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,420
Just did a flip.

252
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:31,860
Just kidding.

253
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,120
Oh.

254
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,460
We did a kickflip.

255
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,480
Nice, Snake.

256
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,500
How many points do I have to...

257
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,300
Oh.

258
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,560
That was a big fall.

259
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,420
That was a big fall.

260
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,860
Are you okay, Snake?

261
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,240
Oh, I have to get on top of those.

262
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,680
Okay, hold on.

263
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,910
Oh, nice, nice.

264
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,890
Good job, Snake.

265
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,250
Good job.

266
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,150
Nice.

267
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,590
Nice.

268
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,130
Did we grind for 100...

269
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,410
How many meters was it?

270
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,370
How do I take this thing out?

271
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,050
Oh my god, it's shooting at me.

272
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,190
Kickflip.

273
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,190
All you did was...

274
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,270
Snake, all you did was jump.

275
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,270
Ha!

276
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,170
Oh!

277
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,240
Oh my god!

278
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,360
How do I get the things up there?

279
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,410
Maybe here.

280
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:44,630
Ha!

281
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:46,710
Nice!

282
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,190
A cipher.

283
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,030
How do I get the things up there, though?

284
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,610
And there's an item over here.

285
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:54,690
Oh.

286
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,690
Oh, Snake, are you okay?

287
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,210
Oh my god.

288
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:00,790
Power slide.

289
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,110
Power slide.

290
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,950
How do I get it over there?

291
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,250
Is that the hidden item?

292
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,830
Wait, I think I can go down here too, though, can't I?

293
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,330
Oh, sorry.

294
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,930
He's so thick, he bounced.

295
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,270
Oh my god, there's so much down here.

296
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,050
Oh, nice, nice, nice!

297
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:22,470
Wow!

298
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:23,490
Nice!

299
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,920
Good job, Snake.

300
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,720
You didn't crash.

301
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,020
You didn't crash and die this time.

302
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,060
Okay.

303
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,320
Thank you, Joshua!

304
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:39,800
Thank you, Joshua!

305
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,840
I can't read it right now.

306
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,700
We have 24 seconds, you guys.

307
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:48,940
We have 24 seconds, you guys.

308
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,240
I don't think we're gonna make it.

309
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,260
I don't think we're gonna make it.

310
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,560
Nice!

311
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,940
Good job, Snake.

312
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,080
Okay, we'll come back for that.

313
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,720
Oh.

314
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,600
What?

315
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,340
Oh my god!

316
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,100
Oh my god!

317
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,760
Oh my god!

318
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,580
Oh my god!

319
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,520
What kind of murder was that?

320
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:08,700
What kind of murder was that?

321
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,370
A D!

322
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,390
No way!

323
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,990
We didn't get a single man.

324
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,130
It's okay.

325
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,270
Oh my...

326
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,750
Those scream while falling feels anticlimactic.

327
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:34,190
I like the way he kinda like, flails his arms a little bit.

328
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,890
Did you guys hear that?

329
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,990
His little...

330
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:52,630
His little...

331
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:52,710
Oh

332
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,270
gosh...

333
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,350
Oh gosh...

334
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,190
Um...

335
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,050
Do I have to do it?

336
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,890
Wait, how fast do I have to go?

337
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,530
No way!

338
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,330
No way!

339
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:09,470
No way!

340
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,090
Body burial.

341
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,190
Body...

342
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,010
Okay.

343
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,710
Oh, it's still alive!

344
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:17,650
Uh oh.

345
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,090
Nice.

346
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,350
50-50 grind.

347
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:23,450
Nice!

348
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,810
50-50 grind.

349
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,010
Oh, it's still alive.

350
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,390
Oh, ouch!

351
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,990
Oh god, we're bleeding!

352
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:34,890
Blue...

353
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,430
British wisp catching a streamer once.

354
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,090
Not a bot.

355
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:38,850
Thank you!

356
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,690
Sorry, I do plan on doing more, um... Come on, Snake.

357
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,830
More EU-friendly streams.

358
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,590
Oh, that's a bird.

359
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,470
Okay, Snake, we need to get you up here.

360
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,270
Oh!

361
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,210
Nice.

362
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,350
I should be more careful.

363
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:57,750
My bad.

364
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,950
Okay, let's go up here.

365
00:18:59,310 --> 00:18:59,890
Here we go.

366
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,230
Nice!

367
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,110
Wow, this is actually huge.

368
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,950
Do a kickflip.

369
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:09,930
Kickflip!

370
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,830
He listens so well!

371
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,150
Oh!

372
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,850
Uh oh.

373
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:21,430
Uh oh.

374
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,030
That should have been easy.

375
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,830
That should have been easy.

376
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,070
Three out of four?

377
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,990
Nice.

378
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,110
Where's the last one, I wonder?

379
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,350
Nice.

380
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:35,770
Um...

381
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,800
How do I grab?

382
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:41,500
Huh!

383
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
Oh, I stuck it!

384
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,520
I stuck it!

385
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:44,940
I stuck it!

386
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,580
Oh!

387
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,480
Na na na!

388
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,170
Uh, let's go back downstairs, I guess.

389
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:55,470
Oh.

390
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,270
Nice.

391
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,670
There's some stuff over here.

392
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:02,970
Snake!

393
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:03,430
Ah!

394
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,270
Yeah, let's make the sound effect ourselves when we die, right?

395
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,030
Okay, but how the heck?

396
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,950
Show us some tricks!

397
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:17,790
Come on!

398
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:18,750
Come on!

399
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,370
Okay, we completed one mission!

400
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,970
We just gotta keep going!

401
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:26,970
Ha!

402
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:28,810
Nose!

403
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,510
Okay, snake.

404
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,090
Grab it!

405
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,270
Oh!

406
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,390
Oh my god!

407
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,230
Yo, yo, we got so many!

408
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,010
Ah!

409
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,250
Ah!

410
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,090
Woo!

411
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:43,890
Woo!

412
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,050
Oh!

413
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,410
Okay, come on!

414
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,350
8000, please!

415
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:53,610
8000!

416
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,670
Come on!

417
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,170
Come on!

418
00:20:59,370 --> 00:20:59,930
Kickflip!

419
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,610
Kickflip!

420
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,170
Come

421
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,020
on!

422
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,880
Please, please, please!

423
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,720
No!

424
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,440
Oh!

425
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,840
No!

426
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,260
We were so close!

427
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,480
We were so close!

428
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,440
Oh my gosh!

429
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,660
If only I had landed it!

430
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,980
If only I had landed it!

431
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,500
Neo, thank you so much for the 20 gift!

432
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:28,980
And thank you!

433
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,960
Did you know that the engine that drives this was made for the Konami skateboarding game, Evolution Skateboarding?

434
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,300
Which also has some big shell base levels as well as Castlevania.

435
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,420
I did know about that!

436
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,120
I didn't know about the Castlevania though, actually.

437
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,040
Hidden...

438
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,340
Grind...

439
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,340
Wait, we still haven't done the full grind?

440
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,400
Oh dang!

441
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,200
Look at me go!

442
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,720
Oh my god!

443
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,320
Hey there, dudette!

444
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,280
Could I get a totally tubular happy birthday on this raddest anniversary of our nation's and my birth?

445
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,480
Get a channel!

446
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,040
You have a pretty awesome birthday!

447
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,880
Happy birthday to you!

448
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,500
Happy birthday to you!

449
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:12,620
Yeah!

450
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
Happy birthday!

451
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,300
Happy April 30th!

452
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,220
The day of George Washington and of Gaia Channel.

453
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,860
Happy birthday to you!

454
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,940
Happy birthday!

455
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,400
I mean, have a radical birthday, bro.

456
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,240
Do you remember what day it is on April 30th?

457
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,900
Yeah, it's the day my dude Snake did a 1080 double ollie and grind.

458
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,600
Dude is bodaciously radical and righteous.

459
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,200
Rose,

460
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,140
what are you doing?

461
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,740
Oh my gosh!

462
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,300
Oh, I stuck that.

463
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:49,960
That was so crazy.

464
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,580
We got all four dog tags.

465
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,240
I wanna blow up the plant!

466
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,340
Okay, that's gonna be our goal right now, is figuring out how to blow up the plant.

467
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,580
I wanna cause violence.

468
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,880
Oh, is it that over there?

469
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,200
No, hold on.

470
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,080
Oh, Snake, turn around.

471
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:12,960
Look!

472
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,480
Look!

473
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,100
Snake, you're doing awesome.

474
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:22,720
Oh!

475
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,320
Ah!

476
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,940
What a shame, indeed.

477
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,540
Choose violence.

478
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,200
Let's go downstairs.

479
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,740
See if we can find how to blow up.

480
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,920
Wait, can you stop for a second, Snake?

481
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,920
So I can look around.

482
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,120
Maybe over there.

483
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,780
Oh, sorry.

484
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,460
Uh-oh.

485
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,480
Was that what I think it was?

486
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,720
Oh, wow!

487
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,100
Oh my god, we made it.

488
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,180
Oh my god, we made it!

489
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:52,400
Oh!

490
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,580
Huh!

491
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:57,900
Um...

492
00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,540
Wow!

493
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,060
Oh god.

494
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,520
Oh!

495
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,220
Uh-oh, Snake, get out of here!

496
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,800
Snake, get out!

497
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:05,580
Snake?

498
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,000
There we go.

499
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,740
No, no, no!

500
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,220
Snake?

501
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,340
Okay, this way.

502
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,240
Never mind!

503
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,420
Why?

504
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,100
Okay.

505
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,420
50-50.

506
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,990
Oh, I see it's a total of 150.

507
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,590
Okay, okay.

508
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,750
I don't know why I thought I had done it.

509
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,050
Oh my god.

510
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,950
Snake, you have to jump up high enough!

511
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,830
Ducky, thank you!

512
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,050
Ooh!

513
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:51,190
Ooh!

514
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,430
Ghostacular Shredder.

515
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,710
Oh god, no, no, we need to...

516
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,970
Come on, Snake!

517
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,520
I wonder if there's a way to get more time.

518
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,020
There's not much point in being here if you don't do any tricks.

519
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,300
Shut up, narrator!

520
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,160
Okay, Snake, jump!

521
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,380
Jump!

522
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,060
Don't do it!

523
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,400
I'm just trying to turn around.

524
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,580
I'm just...

525
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,120
There we go.

526
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,180
Check the other side.

527
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,200
Okay, yeah, let's try this side.

528
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,980
Oh, wait, we need this...

529
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,360
Wait.

530
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,860
Oh, you're...

531
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,920
I think we need this part.

532
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,720
Okay, hold on.

533
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,040
Oh, hold on.

534
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,960
Snake, turn around.

535
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,820
Turn around, Snake!

536
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:43,920
Snake!

537
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,360
Ouch.

538
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,940
Oh my god!

539
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:50,720
Snake!

540
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,120
Looking good, he said.

541
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,880
Looking good, he said.

542
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,900
Oh, interesting.

543
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:07,520
Oh, interesting.

544
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,520
It's okay, we were dead anyway.

545
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,380
Okay, so once we get that...

546
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,660
How do I still have a D?

547
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,000
How do I still have a D?

548
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,160
Okay, then we have to go get the other ones.

549
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,720
Okay, then we have to go get the other ones.

550
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,680
Looking good.

551
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,400
I'm a disaster, yeah.

552
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,200
I'm a disaster, yeah.

553
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,020
Disaster side.

554
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,820
Look at that!

555
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,780
That's so sick!

556
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,580
Look at that!

557
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,480
Look at him go!

558
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,060
Don't look at that.

559
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,760
Don't look at that part.

560
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,680
What's the difference between retry and replay?

561
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,740
I wonder.

562
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,720
You're killing it, dude.

563
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,460
Go!

564
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,440
Uh

565
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,660
oh, I don't think I killed him.

566
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,960
I don't think I killed him.

567
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:58,540
Oh,

568
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,870
it shows the video of what I did.

569
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,130
Okay.

570
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:05,210
Okay.

571
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,710
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

572
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,410
Oh my god!

573
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,730
I made it!

574
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,530
How did I make it?

575
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,370
How did I make it?

576
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,330
Snake, don't...

577
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,870
Okay, Snake.

578
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,370
I need you to just turn around, buddy.

579
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,050
Very slowly.

580
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:24,750
There you go.

581
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:25,050
Okay.

582
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:29,680
Yeah!

583
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:31,540
Okay.

584
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,680
No, please!

585
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:33,920
Please!

586
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,240
Snake, turn around.

587
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,120
We need some... we need some...

588
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,360
Oh wait, let's go to this one real quick.

589
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:41,940
Whoa!

590
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,960
We made it!

591
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,300
We made it!

592
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:49,660
We made it!

593
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,000
We made it!

594
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,660
Okay, there we go.

595
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:51,940
There we go.

596
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,620
Where are those?

597
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,700
Oh, Snake.

598
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:54,760
Oh my god.

599
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,900
He gets a little...

600
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,800
He gets a little out of control, you know?

601
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:02,580
Okay.

602
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:02,900
Nice.

603
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,320
Yeah!

604
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,480
Nice.

605
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,520
Woo!

606
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,940
Oh

607
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,530
my god!

608
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,850
You guys, I'm killing it.

609
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,430
Nice.

610
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:24,870
Oh.

611
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,350
Almost had it.

612
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:26,950
Almost had it.

613
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:27,830
Okay.

614
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,010
I think it's on this side.

615
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:37,450
Let's go and destroy our side out gear!

616
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:39,610
Woo!

617
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,230
Okay, now where the other one is.

618
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:42,850
I don't know.

619
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:44,970
Uh...

620
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:45,850
Wait, now that's a door.

621
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,250
Keep going.

622
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:48,690
Upstairs, maybe?

623
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,070
You think it's upstairs, maybe?

624
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,410
Is this David Hayter VA-ing?

625
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:53,930
I wish.

626
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,230
Shut up!

627
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:00,890
I'm going!

628
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:04,870
Ah!

629
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,870
Oh, there it is.

630
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:08,710
Ah!

631
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,170
He

632
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,360
dead?

633
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,060
Wait.

634
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,520
Wait!

635
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,940
Where is that?

636
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,980
Oh, got a dog tag.

637
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:40,820
Ah!

638
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,520
Oh, ouch.

639
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,000
Ouch, ouch.

640
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,220
Come on, Snake.

641
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,700
Get back up.

642
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,000
Oh my god, no, no.

643
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,740
Don't get me again.

644
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:47,540
Ah!

645
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:51,930
Ah!

646
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,710
Mission completed.

647
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,210
Okay.

648
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,950
Let's do a little celebratory grab.

649
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,530
Or that.

650
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,510
Whatever the hell that was.

651
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:02,970
Um...

652
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:03,590
Ah!

653
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,350
Oh my god!

654
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,310
Are you okay, Snake?

655
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,690
He's fine, he's fine.

656
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:15,350
I wonder if the hidden is like, get all the birds or something.

657
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,890
You know, something crazy like that.

658
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:18,330
Ah!

659
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,210
Nice!

660
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,290
Oh!

661
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,250
We almost had it.

662
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,130
Still a D!

663
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:32,890
Ah!

664
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,540
This makes me want to see you play the original Tony Hawk's game in Tony Hawk's Underground.

665
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,460
You should be more careful.

666
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,600
Ugh!

667
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,920
That's so awesome!

668
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,900
That sound is so great.

669
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,400
Wait, hold on.

670
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,080
I want to see it next.

671
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,840
If we do replay, let's see.

672
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,060
Oh yeah, you're right!

673
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,280
Slow...

674
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,500
Oh yeah!

675
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,860
Oh my god!

676
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,180
Whoa!

677
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,120
How do I go fast?

678
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,480
Oh.

679
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:14,920
Wait, no, no, no!

680
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,740
Back, back, back, back!

681
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,440
Oh, I went...

682
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:18,420
Yeah!

683
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,320
And then...

684
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,460
Slow...

685
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,140
Oh, no!

686
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:25,780
Snake!

687
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,120
And then I stood there trying to turn around.

688
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,340
And then I stood there trying to turn around.

689
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:45,630
Frame advanced.

690
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,550
Oh wow!

691
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,250
We can get like frame perfect shots!

692
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:54,410
We can get like frame perfect shots!

693
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,150
Yeah!

694
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:56,710
Yeah!

695
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,330
I should not have made that.

696
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,790
I think he's a pro.

697
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:05,770
Oh!

698
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:06,890
It's okay.

699
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:07,390
He lived.

700
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,370
And then he...

701
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,210
It's okay!

702
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:13,810
It's okay!

703
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:14,070
He's...

704
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:17,350
It's the...

705
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,170
It's me trying to do the set up.

706
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,770
It's killing me.

707
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,420
L1 is slow, right?

708
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,860
It doesn't feel very slow.

709
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,160
Yeah!

710
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,080
Oh my gosh!

711
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,440
We went crazy there.

712
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,060
Oh god.

713
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,480
Yeah!

714
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,840
Oh, and then I fell off.

715
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,180
That's okay.

716
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,400
I'm surprised they didn't include Fatman on his rollerblades for this.

717
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:47,640
Right!

718
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,660
It would have been perfect.

719
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
Oh, I'm crying.

720
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,380
I'm crying from laughing so much.

721
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,360
It only has been a half hour.

722
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:01,880
It only has been a half hour.

723
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,320
This game is kind of cruel though.

724
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,040
They give you...

725
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,040
Oh, I clicked restart!

726
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:11,700
Oh, no.

727
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,640
They...

728
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,080
They only give you like so few times...

729
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,420
so few minutes.

730
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,960
Thank you, Dive!

731
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,200
Could you perhaps may chance be untubular?

732
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,860
Absolutely not.

733
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,840
I am the most tubular ghost man you'll ever meet.

734
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,160
There's one thing.

735
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,840
You'll find out when you see a man grinding on a skateboard on the connecting half pipe to Shell 2.

736
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,320
I've seen someone use that box trick before.

737
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,260
We'll lay a trap on Shell 2 connecting half pipe.

738
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,580
There he goes.

739
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,840
Okay, retry.

740
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,280
How many...

741
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,640
How much time do we have?

742
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,560
Three minutes?

743
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:06,900
Yeah.

744
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,800
Bod-varian.

745
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,840
Oh, no, Snake.

746
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:17,700
Jump.

747
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,100
No, Skryde.

748
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,780
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

749
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,940
No, no, no, no, no, no.

750
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:25,680
Dang it.

751
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,260
We got it though.

752
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,360
We got it though.

753
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,020
Nice.

754
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,780
How do we get the ones up there?

755
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:31,460
What?

756
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,380
I want...

757
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,340
Oh, sorry, Snake.

758
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,780
I also want the stuff back there.

759
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:36,620
Okay.

760
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,500
Go, Snake.

761
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,200
Go.

762
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:41,580
Hula!

763
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,840
Impossible!

764
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,680
Impossible!

765
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,440
We make the impossible possible.

766
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,520
I have a feeling that the...

767
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,620
that the birds have something to do with the hidden one.

768
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,340
Oh, nice.

769
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,080
Nice.

770
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,500
Not today.

771
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,020
Cypher!

772
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,420
Ouch!

773
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,180
Why are you still shooting me?

774
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,560
This is good, isn't it?

775
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,060
Can you imagine what Big Boss would think?

776
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,660
Oh, yeah.

777
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,020
Let's go.

778
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,940
Let's go blow up.

779
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,120
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

780
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,220
Okay.

781
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,640
Hup!

782
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,460
Oh, nice!

783
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,600
Hup!

784
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:34,740
Oh.

785
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:35,780
Snake.

786
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,120
Snake.

787
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,340
Jump.

788
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:36,980
There we go.

789
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,200
Yeah!

790
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:39,920
Yeah!

791
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,900
Big Boss would be like, that's my son.

792
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,340
Oh.

793
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:48,780
No!

794
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,360
I was not aligned.

795
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:51,940
It's okay.

796
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,320
50-50 grind.

797
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,120
This remix is awesome.

798
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:01,840
Oh.

799
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,320
What the?

800
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:02,820
What's going on?

801
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,860
My son.

802
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,000
Oh.

803
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,560
No!

804
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:07,700
Oh.

805
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,060
Snake.

806
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,420
Nose grind.

807
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,500
Grind mission completed!

808
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,440
Awesome.

809
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,200
Hup!

810
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:21,830
Okay.

811
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,470
Here's the true mission.

812
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,890
The true challenge.

813
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:28,550
Ah!

814
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,900
We only have 30 seconds, Snake.

815
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,740
We gotta get destroyin'.

816
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,320
I'm trying!

817
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,320
I'm trying, sir!

818
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,400
Please.

819
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:47,960
Hup!

820
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,400
Snake!

821
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:48,960
Yes.

822
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,360
Yes.

823
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:49,700
Yes.

824
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:51,500
Nice!

825
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,500
Okay.

826
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:52,760
Okay.

827
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:52,960
Okay.

828
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,400
Let's go get the first one.

829
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,140
Come on, Snake.

830
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,160
Come on.

831
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:56,540
We got this.

832
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,280
Right here.

833
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:57,620
Right here.

834
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:57,980
Right here.

835
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,300
Right here.

836
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,920
Right here!

837
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,820
Don't try too hard.

838
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,200
Don't try too hard.

839
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,380
Oh!

840
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:08,920
Oh!

841
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,340
Oh no!

842
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,220
We don't have the time!

843
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:10,940
Go, Snake!

844
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,240
Go!

845
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,020
I don't think we're gonna make it.

846
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,660
We're not gonna make it.

847
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,840
Don't try too hard.

848
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,300
We only got one in the end.

849
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,940
Actually, it says there's four...

850
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,120
It says there's four...

851
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,000
Four...

852
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,980
Ciphers, but...

853
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,000
But I only saw three.

854
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,100
Three!

855
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,800
We gotta go find the last one.

856
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,040
Retry.

857
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,380
Let's go try... Let's go find the last one.

858
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,940
Hmm... A board to surpass Metal Gear.

859
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,120
We

860
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:09,680
didn't...

861
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,300
We didn't take him out, but that's... Okay!

862
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,720
This way.

863
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,500
Oh my god.

864
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,700
How am I supposed to do this?

865
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,720
No way.

866
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,160
Wait.

867
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,420
Do I go, like, from up here?

868
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,040
Oh, we made it.

869
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,640
We lived.

870
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:37,740
Okay.

871
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:39,780
Okay,

872
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:46,620
hold on.

873
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,800
We need some...

874
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,380
Oh.

875
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,240
We need some air.

876
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,760
We need some... Here we go.

877
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,000
Here we go.

878
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:52,800
Okay.

879
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,300
From here.

880
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:53,580
From here.

881
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,900
And... Jump!

882
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,480
Snake, why don't you jump?

883
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,820
Why don't you jump, Snake?

884
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,120
Why?

885
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,840
There's not much point being here if you don't do any tricks.

886
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,640
Jump!

887
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,170
I think it's jump and release...

888
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,370
I think the release... Okay.

889
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,330
Like, I think it's...

890
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,030
Okay, like this?

891
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:29,530
Jump!

892
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:31,430
Cha-ching!

893
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,070
Okay.

894
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:32,410
Okay.

895
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:32,970
I get it now.

896
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:33,530
I get it now.

897
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:34,250
Okay.

898
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,850
So it's... You hold...

899
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:38,950
I get it.

900
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:39,430
I get it.

901
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:39,810
I get it.

902
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,210
Here we go.

903
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:43,370
Come on, Snake.

904
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:45,170
Ha!

905
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,570
Cha-ching!

906
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,770
Okay, now that's...

907
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,890
What am I supposed to do there?

908
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:53,870
Wait.

909
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,610
Do I... Can I grind and jump at the same time?

910
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,270
It's like that in Tony Hawk 2.

911
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,050
It's like that in Tony Hawk 2.

912
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:00,050
Okay.

913
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:00,350
Okay.

914
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,570
Jump off.

915
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,610
Oh, wait.

916
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:06,790
Oh,

917
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,120
so close.

918
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,260
You're so close.

919
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,800
Good jump.

920
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,260
Good jump.

921
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,380
No!

922
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,500
How am I supposed to jump?

923
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,720
Oh my gosh.

924
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,380
We're gonna get this.

925
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,040
We're gonna get this.

926
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,480
This will... This is what we'll practice.

927
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,180
Okay.

928
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:40,680
Here we go.

929
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,560
I'm holding... I'm holding... Jump!

930
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,650
Grind on the handrail instead?

931
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,750
There's no way I should keep getting a D.

932
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,970
Okay, let's go back to that spot.

933
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,850
Let's go back to that spot.

934
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:07,930
Yeah.

935
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,030
Okay.

936
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,430
Huh?

937
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,050
I pressed...

938
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,410
I pressed the wrong line.

939
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:30,130
Ha.

940
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,670
Ha.

941
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:31,950
Ha.

942
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,370
Ha.

943
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:32,810
Ha.

944
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,460
Ha.

945
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:37,740
Ha.

946
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,460
Ha.

947
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:38,480
Ha.

948
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:38,960
Ha.

949
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,120
Ha.

950
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,360
Ha.

951
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:39,380
Ha.

952
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:39,380
Ha.

953
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:39,380
Ha.

954
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,460
Ha.

955
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:47,460
Ha.

956
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:47,460
Ha.

957
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:47,460
Ha.

958
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,120
I think... I think I get the timing.

959
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,200
Maybe... Oh my god.

960
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:52,880
Alright, here we go.

961
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,380
Turn around.

962
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,240
Go!

963
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,830
This is so... tricky!

964
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:10,510
It's okay.

965
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:13,810
Snake... Snake, you... you got this.

966
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:14,370
You got this, buddy.

967
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:14,810
Okay.

968
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,180
Fine, what are you doing?

969
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:22,900
Hold on.

970
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,660
Okay, hold on.

971
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,160
Too early might be better than too late.

972
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:27,440
Yeah.

973
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,320
Hold on.

974
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:28,660
Okay.

975
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,380
Okay, if I'm grinding... grind, grind, grind on there.

976
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:35,760
Okay.

977
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,440
Okay, okay.

978
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,980
I'm shredding, I'm shredding, I'm shredding, I'm shredding, I'm shredding.

979
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,800
We got this!

980
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,460
Dude!

981
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,460
I was a little off on my calculations.

982
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,270
Okay.

983
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,150
We have a whole minute to learn this.

984
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:04,570
Oh!

985
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,530
This guy is getting on my nerves.

986
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:14,110
How is it so funny every time?

987
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,630
It's the way he like flails his arm, you know?

988
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:17,830
Alright, here we go.

989
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:18,150
Here we go.

990
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:20,670
Why?

991
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:21,110
Why?

992
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:21,410
Why?

993
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,710
When I'm off, sometimes he catches it.

994
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,510
Other times, he doesn't catch it.

995
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:30,290
Okay.

996
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,030
Here we go.

997
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:35,090
Please, show us some tricks.

998
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:36,790
Please.

999
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,570
Please do something.

1000
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:39,290
Okay.

1001
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,050
Down.

1002
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:40,330
Ah!

1003
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:41,150
What?

1004
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:41,870
Okay.

1005
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:42,510
You guys.

1006
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:44,570
I...

1007
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:45,930
I...

1008
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,530
I was holding X the whole time.

1009
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,270
Okay.

1010
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:53,650
Okay.

1011
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:56,250
Okay.

1012
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:00,630
That one, I was not holding X.

1013
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:00,950
Ugh.

1014
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,130
Ugh.

1015
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:03,450
Ugh.

1016
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,070
But did you release X?

1017
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:06,410
No.

1018
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,190
I did!

1019
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,130
You can't see my hands.

1020
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:11,530
Actually, you can see my hands.

1021
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,650
But my hands are shredding right now.

1022
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:16,870
I'm focused on my own grind.

1023
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:17,310
Okay?

1024
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:19,970
Okay.

1025
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,530
Are you playing through OBS?

1026
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:24,590
Oh.

1027
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:47,650
Oopsie.

1028
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:49,650
Oh.

1029
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,280
Ta-ting!

1030
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,580
I... I basically... That was like a hoop, though.

1031
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,200
Come on.

1032
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,500
Eh?

1033
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,200
What is that?

1034
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,920
How do you land that?

1035
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,420
Come on, Snake.

1036
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,110
All you did was jump!

1037
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:24,690
Oh my God.

1038
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:25,030
Okay.

1039
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:25,290
Okay.

1040
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:25,470
Okay.

1041
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:25,630
Okay.

1042
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,370
Bomb rush cyberpunk.

1043
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:33,650
I don't

1044
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,420
even see what it was!

1045
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,040
What was the hidden?

1046
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,680
Where's the...

1047
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,480
I'm trapped here.

1048
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:49,940
Oh.

1049
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,880
I'm trapped here, you guys.

1050
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,240
Uh-oh.

1051
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:55,640
No, Snake.

1052
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,000
Turn around.

1053
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:56,600
Turn around, Snake.

1054
00:45:59,400 --> 00:45:59,800
No!

1055
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,660
That's a disappointment.

1056
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,960
What was the thing?

1057
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,200
Hang on.

1058
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,200
Okay.

1059
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,120
Here we go.

1060
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,220
Oh.

1061
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,160
Come on, Snake.

1062
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,220
We need you to catch some...

1063
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,330
I did not press X soon enough.

1064
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:31,870
That was mean.

1065
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:33,390
It's all mean.

1066
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:34,450
It's okay, though.

1067
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,130
We got it one time.

1068
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:35,810
We can get it again.

1069
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:36,890
This is it.

1070
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,000
What?!

1071
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,580
I held X.

1072
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,200
You gave...

1073
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:49,960
You gave...

1074
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:50,940
I held X.

1075
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,000
Fifty-five!

1076
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,540
No, please!

1077
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,280
Please, I held X and I let go!

1078
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,740
This is so messed up!

1079
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,500
This is so messed up, Snake!

1080
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,220
Okay, come on.

1081
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,000
Why I'm not grinding on the rails outside?

1082
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,320
Instead of jumping?

1083
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,640
Because you have to...

1084
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,960
Because they cut off.

1085
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:24,980
You have to do it.

1086
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,300
Oh, unless you mean like...

1087
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,440
Okay, I think I...

1088
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,480
So like controlling it to go to the...

1089
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:33,760
Okay.

1090
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,300
I think I know what you mean.

1091
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,280
I think I know...

1092
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:36,940
Hold on, let me see.

1093
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,420
I think...

1094
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:39,480
I think I get what you're saying.

1095
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,340
I think I'm catching what you're putting down.

1096
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,100
I think I'm...

1097
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,200
Understanding the gravity of the situation.

1098
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,320
Okay.

1099
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,060
I think I got it.

1100
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,020
I think I know what you mean.

1101
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,040
I'm gonna try it.

1102
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:54,720
No guarantees.

1103
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,840
Like so here...

1104
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,100
And then...

1105
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,180
Oh, I won't let...

1106
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,400
Unless it's like pitch perfect.

1107
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,780
I don't know about that one.

1108
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,620
I don't know about that one.

1109
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:17,800
Yeah...

1110
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:31,410
What's over here too?

1111
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:35,730
Alright, snake.

1112
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:48,570
But slowly.

1113
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:49,250
Slowly.

1114
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:50,090
Slowly, snake.

1115
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:50,410
Slowly.

1116
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:51,590
Don't...

1117
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:52,510
You don't wanna die here.

1118
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:52,810
Snake.

1119
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:53,350
Snake.

1120
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:54,390
Snake.

1121
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:56,810
Looking good.

1122
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:02,190
Why can't I...

1123
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:03,170
Why can't I grab it?

1124
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:06,090
Good?

1125
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:07,650
Um...

1126
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:10,150
What?

1127
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:12,370
Okay, I think it's bugged maybe.

1128
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:17,800
Nice.

1129
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,120
Oh.

1130
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:20,940
Ah!

1131
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:21,760
Oh!

1132
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,300
Oh!

1133
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:22,880
We got this guy.

1134
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,060
Oh!

1135
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:26,580
Do

1136
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:30,850
I have a health?

1137
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:31,230
I wonder.

1138
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:33,270
Oh.

1139
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:34,350
We almost made it.

1140
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:35,150
No, no, snake.

1141
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,190
Snake, don't die!

1142
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:41,050
Phantom coin.

1143
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:43,330
Okay.

1144
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:49,720
Oh!

1145
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,340
Almost.

1146
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:05,920
Oh.

1147
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:06,760
No, I...

1148
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,300
I...

1149
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,080
I don't think it read the image.

1150
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:09,320
I don't think it's a good input.

1151
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,800
Happy Big Shell Day!

1152
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,600
Happy!

1153
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:14,300
Whoa!

1154
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,640
Big Shell Day, everybody!

1155
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:21,720
Yeah!

1156
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:26,880
Yaaaay!

1157
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,540
Wow!

1158
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:33,260
Yes!

1159
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,000
Adio!

1160
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,000
After all of that?

1161
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,120
Still, we get the big D.

1162
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,700
A hind D!

1163
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,760
A hind D!

1164
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,380
Let's check out Raiden's.

1165
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:08,060
Endgame.

1166
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,640
That was a good run, though.

1167
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:11,220
Good run, everybody.

1168
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:11,820
Wait.

1169
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:12,500
Oh, wait!

1170
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,300
Oh, I just realized my bad.

1171
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,400
I thought... I don't know what I thought.

1172
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,660
Sorry, my PS2 is going kind of crazy.

1173
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,580
My D is ready for the X Games.

1174
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:29,480
Hope you're having a totally gnarly April 30th and enjoying the FGS skateboarding.

1175
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:36,540
The full game is playable Grilukovic soldiers, Simon Belmont, Frogger the Frog, and boss battles against enemies like Dracula.

1176
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,460
Plus, it's fun having snakes skate in Tokyo.

1177
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,380
Yeah!

1178
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,600
Oh my gosh!

1179
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,940
Splitstream Sim.

1180
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,700
Looking pretty rad, boss.

1181
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,200
Thanks.

1182
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,480
This is how George Washington always wanted us to commemorate today.

1183
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:55,220
Don't you agree?

1184
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,800
This is actually how we crossed the Delaware River.

1185
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,140
I didn't know if you knew that.

1186
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,160
I didn't.

1187
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,680
I didn't know that.

1188
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:04,520
That guy.

1189
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,120
Mr. Washington.

1190
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,100
I hope you're watching.

1191
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,900
This is what you fought for.

1192
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,380
This is what makes us free.

1193
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:14,860
The right to skate!

1194
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,680
Wherever we please!

1195
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,960
It would have been so cool if I had blown up the...

1196
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,300
Okay, let's try it.

1197
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,360
I wonder if there's a blow up one for Raiden too.

1198
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,440
So this is Route B.

1199
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,400
So I guess it's different.

1200
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,160
Prognosticateur.

1201
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,460
Mint has to nerf herself through OBS because she would be too good.

1202
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,060
I finally figured out how to do it though.

1203
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,120
Operate the crane.

1204
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,220
Collect four rations.

1205
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,480
Wait, is there less stuff for Raiden than there is for Snake?

1206
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,680
Where am I crazy?

1207
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,080
8,000 points.

1208
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,440
Rhyme 150.

1209
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,660
Look at his...

1210
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:02,920
Sir?

1211
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,800
What are you doing to the skateboard, huh?

1212
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,900
Yeah, there's no dog tags.

1213
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,100
Yeah, yeah.

1214
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,100
Hands on the...

1215
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:13,780
Sir?

1216
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,200
Raiden?

1217
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,260
Raiden?

1218
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,480
Raiden?

1219
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,240
Oh, he's serving.

1220
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,720
Look at him.

1221
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,540
Rations instead of dog tags.

1222
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,320
Okay.

1223
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,120
Go!

1224
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:36,820
Go!

1225
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,400
I see a ration right over here.

1226
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,240
I keep...

1227
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:43,600
Oh.

1228
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,400
Whoa, look it.

1229
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,100
There's a whole place here for us to grind.

1230
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,100
Tail slide.

1231
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,080
There it is.

1232
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1233
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,840
Dang it.

1234
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,840
I don't think I destroyed it though.

1235
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:07,680
Ow!

1236
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,500
Oh god, Raiden, your head.

1237
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:11,980
Are you okay?

1238
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,840
Oh, you almost had it.

1239
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,200
You should be more careful.

1240
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:29,240
It's time for Jack to let it kick.

1241
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,060
You guys like that?

1242
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:39,780
Rrrr.

1243
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,560
Raiden, Raiden.

1244
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,420
Rules of Skater.

1245
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:53,980
Thank you for the Hakketsu.

1246
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,900
Oh my god, please.

1247
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:01,390
Um, we'll just ignore that for now, okay?

1248
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:02,610
Just kidding.

1249
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:05,070
Justice.

1250
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:06,650
Has been served.

1251
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:10,430
Nice!

1252
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:11,430
It's okay.

1253
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,950
We at least took him out.

1254
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:15,730
We at least took him out.

1255
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:17,970
Nice!

1256
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,570
Doctor, turn off my skate inhibitors.

1257
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:31,310
It's time for Jack to let her rip.

1258
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,820
Come on, Burge.

1259
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:42,980
Oh, it almost had that skating here.

1260
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,520
I realized.

1261
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,520
Nice!

1262
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:51,980
Almost had the body burial, but we at least killed the thing.

1263
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,350
Keep going, keep going.

1264
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:58,890
Oh, so close.

1265
00:55:59,070 --> 00:55:59,890
So close.

1266
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:00,970
Oh, oh, oh.

1267
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:02,110
I thought I was about to die.

1268
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:03,430
Huh!

1269
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:06,490
Yeah!

1270
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:11,720
That's the way, baby!

1271
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,760
How do I destroy?

1272
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,500
Maybe down.

1273
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:15,900
Oh!

1274
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,320
Huh!

1275
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:19,920
Whoa!

1276
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:20,900
We made that!

1277
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,500
No way!

1278
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,800
I like destroying the boxes, too.

1279
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,820
Oh, yo!

1280
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:31,960
Yo!

1281
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,220
We did that, guys.

1282
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,560
This is the crane, obviously.

1283
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:38,860
Hmm...

1284
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,240
We gotta figure out...

1285
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:40,720
Ah!

1286
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,180
Ah!

1287
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,500
We try, we try, we try.

1288
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,300
Go!

1289
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:49,120
Go!

1290
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,260
Let's do this first.

1291
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,160
50-50, Burge.

1292
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,460
50-50, Burge.

1293
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,280
I can never make it.

1294
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,040
Oh my god.

1295
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,620
Come on, come on, Ryland.

1296
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,360
Nice!

1297
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:09,300
Oh!

1298
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,600
I can never get the body burial.

1299
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:12,820
Scary.

1300
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:13,860
What's scary?

1301
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,520
What's scary?

1302
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:21,440
Did they want to say kawaii?

1303
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,780
Kawaii and kowaii are different.

1304
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:35,200
Of course they wanted to say kawaii instead of kowaii, you know what I'm saying?

1305
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:36,820
Oh, no!

1306
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:38,880
Impossible!

1307
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,240
Impossible!

1308
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,020
That was a big fall!

1309
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:46,950
Nice.

1310
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:48,710
Even though I didn't get it.

1311
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:49,150
Nice.

1312
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:52,430
Wait, is the hidden spot in the same place?

1313
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:54,170
No way.

1314
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:05,610
That was sweet!

1315
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,110
Oh, no, no, no.

1316
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:08,630
No, no!

1317
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:18,440
Oh, dang it.

1318
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,440
Nice.

1319
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,020
Took that guy out.

1320
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:29,020
Nice!

1321
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,540
Took that guy out.

1322
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,180
I'm starting to get sweaty.

1323
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,180
I'm shredding too much, dude.

1324
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,680
I'm just... Okay, here we go.

1325
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,400
Oh, no!

1326
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,100
I almost had it!

1327
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:46,740
I forgot.

1328
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,580
Okay.

1329
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,160
It's not a disappointment.

1330
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,340
My mom says I'm not a disappointment.

1331
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,380
Okay, hold on.

1332
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,760
Oh, no!

1333
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,380
I jumped too early.

1334
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,140
I jumped too early.

1335
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,520
Denver!

1336
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,740
Welcome to

1337
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,270
Nembu ship!

1338
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:18,490
We got this.

1339
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:26,490
Please!

1340
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:28,650
Please, I don't have much time!

1341
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:30,030
Please, game!

1342
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:31,890
No, please, Watashi!

1343
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:33,570
Raiden!

1344
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:34,970
Stop going through.

1345
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:35,390
Okay.

1346
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:38,130
Please, Watashi, make it!

1347
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:38,710
Ha!

1348
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:47,950
Not the hidden.

1349
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:49,410
Huh?

1350
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:52,230
That wasn't the hidden?

1351
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:54,990
Uh-oh.

1352
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:02,180
Baited for real.

1353
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:02,260
Baited for real.

1354
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:07,970
Okay.

1355
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:10,570
Let's try and find the way to activate the crane.

1356
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:13,930
Um, I also want to find...

1357
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:15,930
I only know where two rations are?

1358
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:17,130
I only know where two rations are?

1359
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:20,570
Nice.

1360
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:24,350
Nice.

1361
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:27,830
You're so radical, MaidmentVTuber.

1362
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:28,410
Thank you.

1363
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:30,870
Thanks.

1364
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:32,890
I know.

1365
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:34,310
I like...

1366
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:36,190
I like who I am.

1367
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:38,510
Getting some sick air.

1368
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:44,430
Is this even possible?

1369
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:46,050
I don't know.

1370
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,290
Let's go upstairs.

1371
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:50,690
Oh, come on.

1372
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:52,590
Raiden, you have to push.

1373
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:55,350
Oh, is this it?

1374
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:00,020
Oh!

1375
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,560
There's the hidden!

1376
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,700
One out of Oh!

1377
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,120
That's a disappointment.

1378
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:12,590
Nice.

1379
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:13,430
Keep it going.

1380
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:14,930
Keep it going.

1381
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:16,190
It's right there, isn't it?

1382
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:24,640
Oh, I have to go downstairs and do it!

1383
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:24,880
Okay.

1384
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:25,800
Erg.

1385
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,620
Oh, there's the other ration.

1386
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:30,820
Oh, we made it!

1387
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:31,980
Let's go.

1388
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:38,100
Wait.

1389
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:39,580
What does Circle do again?

1390
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,700
I can't remember what's the difference between Circle and...

1391
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:46,340
Square.

1392
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:46,580
Square.

1393
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:49,400
One of them's grab, one of them's something.

1394
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,080
How do you use your special?

1395
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,320
I have no idea.

1396
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,040
Circle is grab.

1397
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,900
Circle is grab tricks.

1398
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:00,760
Okay, okay, okay.

1399
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:09,000
I tried maybe, like, grabbing the side of it.

1400
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,440
It didn't really work.

1401
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:13,860
No, Raiden!

1402
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:14,060
No!

1403
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:16,000
Actually, that works.

1404
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:17,920
Nice.

1405
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:22,320
What?

1406
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,220
Is this what happened on April 30th?

1407
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:25,740
You know it.

1408
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:27,580
You know it.

1409
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,440
And that's how we get the hidden!

1410
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,880
Come on.

1411
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:41,480
Get out of here.

1412
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:42,680
Just leave.

1413
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:44,900
Oh.

1414
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:45,620
Just go.

1415
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,480
Just go, Raiden.

1416
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,460
Just go.

1417
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,660
I wanna get more than a D.

1418
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,420
I wanna get...

1419
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:53,760
A C!

1420
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,200
A C!

1421
01:02:59,200 --> 01:02:59,440
A C!

1422
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,520
So close.

1423
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,140
No ration, please.

1424
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:05,560
I wanna get a C!

1425
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:06,420
I wanna get a C!

1426
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,380
I wanna get a C!

1427
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:12,010
Yes!

1428
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:12,330
Yes!

1429
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:15,090
That might be it.

1430
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:15,730
That might be a C.

1431
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:17,610
That might be a C, you guys.

1432
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:19,070
Can we get any more?

1433
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:21,410
Wow!

1434
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,380
Are you kidding me?

1435
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,780
Are you, like, squitting me right now?

1436
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:43,200
Are you, like, squitting me right now?

1437
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,440
Is it just D or...

1438
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,680
D or no D?

1439
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:52,740
You know?

1440
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,740
You have to get the D?

1441
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,800
Or else...

1442
01:03:57,490 --> 01:03:58,080
Or else?

1443
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,080
Is a C in my heart?

1444
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:00,900
F.

1445
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:03,360
No, it's a D!

1446
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,480
Don't make it any lower!

1447
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:12,320
Because I'm not doing enough side tricks.

1448
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,400
Oh, sorry.

1449
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,100
Sick tricks.

1450
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,080
Actually, though...

1451
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:23,750
Raiden.

1452
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:26,970
Oh, Raiden.

1453
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:29,150
Oh, Raiden.

1454
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:29,570
We gotta grind.

1455
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:30,430
We gotta score.

1456
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:30,910
Crash?

1457
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:32,390
What's the crash?

1458
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:34,650
Wait, what is...

1459
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:37,510
Oh, the probes.

1460
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:41,730
Look at the membership!

1461
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:42,330
Thank you!

1462
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:46,290
Score's too low.

1463
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:46,710
Score's too low.

1464
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:49,830
So maybe it doesn't have anything to do with the missions.

1465
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:52,230
Maybe it's all...

1466
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,760
Maybe it's more to do with the...

1467
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:02,000
There it is.

1468
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:03,380
Our actual score.

1469
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,540
What if I just grind the whole time?

1470
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,360
There we go.

1471
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,020
Nice!

1472
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,200
Special R1.

1473
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,600
Can get you a lot of points.

1474
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,320
R1 is our special!

1475
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,000
Oh!

1476
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:26,900
Oh, nice, nice, nice!

1477
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:27,600
Okay.

1478
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,180
Also, I keep forgetting about...

1479
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:31,980
This!

1480
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,920
We can flip in the air!

1481
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:34,400
Keep forgetting!

1482
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:38,380
Smooth!

1483
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:42,420
So we have to go upstairs first, right?

1484
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:44,360
So far, so good.

1485
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,120
Ish.

1486
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:45,880
Come on, Raiden.

1487
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:48,260
Oh.

1488
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:53,050
I keep forgetting about L2 and R2.

1489
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:53,990
Oh.

1490
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:54,390
I keep forgetting about L2 and R2.

1491
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:57,580
Oops.

1492
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,700
We did something there.

1493
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,060
Oh no!

1494
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:00,660
Raiden!

1495
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:01,480
Go back!

1496
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,100
Minty's a real skater, not a poser.

1497
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:07,060
Obviously.

1498
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:10,220
See?

1499
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,480
Only a real skater would have landed that.

1500
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:17,640
Nice!

1501
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:21,020
Okay,

1502
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:24,980
let's go back downstairs.

1503
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,660
Oh, Raiden, Raiden!

1504
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,160
Wait, turn around.

1505
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:29,960
Oh wait!

1506
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:31,220
Actually...

1507
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,560
Yeah, I wanted to do that.

1508
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,020
Maybe I'm not hitting enough of the...

1509
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:38,540
Or landing enough...

1510
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:39,940
Nice!

1511
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:43,600
I destroy the things, but I don't land the trick.

1512
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:43,920
You know?

1513
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:51,910
Come on.

1514
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:53,010
Let's go.

1515
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:54,370
And...

1516
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:56,070
Nice!

1517
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:02,090
Why does this game even have skateboarding?

1518
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:03,570
Why wouldn't it?

1519
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,390
Because MGS2...

1520
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:07,610
Is the greatest...

1521
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:09,850
Of all time!

1522
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:13,490
I'm grinding up the stairs.

1523
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:15,730
I'm grinding up the stairs.

1524
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:19,530
Go, go, go.

1525
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:20,450
Come on, Raiden.

1526
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:21,650
Go, go, go.

1527
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:23,130
Oh my god.

1528
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:23,350
Please.

1529
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,700
Oh my god.

1530
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:32,220
That was close.

1531
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:34,500
Okay.

1532
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,340
Now we gotta get this ration.

1533
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:39,520
Wait.

1534
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,740
Does L2...

1535
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:40,980
Wait.

1536
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:42,720
Maybe L2...

1537
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,140
And R2 don't do anything.

1538
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,000
I'm trying!

1539
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,020
Oh my god.

1540
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:49,280
Wait.

1541
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:50,100
No, please.

1542
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:52,960
Oh.

1543
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:55,400
What did I say, though?

1544
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,140
What was the jump button again?

1545
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:57,680
It's X.

1546
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,280
That was...

1547
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:08,100
That was...

1548
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,990
You guys!

1549
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:15,170
We did it!

1550
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:17,530
We got the C!

1551
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:20,970
We did it!

1552
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:23,670
I actually feel like I was doing pretty well until the end there.

1553
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:24,750
Oh my gosh.

1554
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:25,730
If I had collected...

1555
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:26,670
If I had gotten that...

1556
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:27,730
And then the score.

1557
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:28,850
Oh my gosh!

1558
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:32,350
Random well-being checkup.

1559
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:33,370
How have you been, Big Mint?

1560
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:35,430
Here's $50-y news.

1561
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:36,990
Get yourself some bread, mate.

1562
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:39,630
Maybe some banh mi, too.

1563
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:40,710
Thank you!

1564
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:41,570
I'm good.

1565
01:08:41,730 --> 01:08:42,630
Thank you so much.

1566
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:44,330
I mean, I'm totally tubular.

1567
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:45,090
I just got a C.

1568
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:45,810
And you know what?

1569
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:46,970
C means degree.

1570
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:49,370
C means degree.

1571
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:52,110
Yeah!

1572
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:56,590
C's get degrees.

1573
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:58,210
That's the saying.

1574
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:03,790
C's be degrees Celsius.

1575
01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:10,930
Oh man.

1576
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:11,750
Yeah!

1577
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:12,750
Yeah!

1578
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:14,830
Absolutely!

1579
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:18,110
C means cool.

1580
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:20,150
I like the blowing.

1581
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:22,310
I actually think Snake's map was harder.

1582
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:23,950
I think it was more difficult.

1583
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:26,990
But maybe that means we can actually...

1584
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:29,190
um...

1585
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:31,930
complete all the missions on this one.

1586
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:32,830
Who knows?

1587
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:35,150
Oh, no!

1588
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:35,650
No!

1589
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:37,070
Come on.

1590
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:38,250
Come on, Raiden.

1591
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:39,870
Get it together, buddy.

1592
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:44,050
So close.

1593
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:49,890
Oh, C, C, C!

1594
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:51,130
Oh, wait.

1595
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:52,190
I did go the right way.

1596
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:53,370
I thought it was going wrong.

1597
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:57,030
Okay.

1598
01:09:57,190 --> 01:09:58,330
That's fine too.

1599
01:09:59,160 --> 01:09:59,930
Raiden, please.

1600
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:01,610
Raiden.

1601
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:03,050
Raiden.

1602
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:07,390
To take care of the terrorists.

1603
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:10,230
You must grind.

1604
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:13,450
Oh, damn.

1605
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:15,030
We didn't...

1606
01:10:15,030 --> 01:10:15,730
He's gonna...

1607
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:17,390
Yeah!

1608
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:23,750
All according to plan.

1609
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:24,710
Obviously.

1610
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:28,490
Nice!

1611
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:31,490
Nice!

1612
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:32,190
Nice!

1613
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:39,690
Oh, no!

1614
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:40,950
I was so close.

1615
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:43,230
You know what?

1616
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:43,750
We got the money.

1617
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:44,690
We got the cash money.

1618
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:45,110
It's fine.

1619
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:46,590
Let's get out of here.

1620
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:47,670
Let's go blow...

1621
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:48,470
Not blow it.

1622
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:49,110
Let's go do a crane.

1623
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:54,890
Kickflip!

1624
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:56,510
Kickflip!

1625
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:59,010
Give us some extra points.

1626
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:00,670
While we're...

1627
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:01,130
Oh.

1628
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:03,390
Come on, Raiden.

1629
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:05,470
Come on, Raiden.

1630
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:06,070
Okay.

1631
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:07,030
You know what?

1632
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:07,470
This works too.

1633
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:10,270
We gotta get the...

1634
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:11,630
We gotta get our grind on.

1635
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:14,890
We gotta get our grind on.

1636
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:23,540
Ouch.

1637
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,060
I missed that a little bit.

1638
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,720
No, that is not a solid snake.

1639
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:29,440
That's sick!

1640
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:29,860
Snake!

1641
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:31,880
Yeah!

1642
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:35,440
Looks like...

1643
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,540
Out of seven uniques.

1644
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,020
Okay.

1645
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:48,280
Alright, here we go.

1646
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:50,640
Impossible!

1647
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:51,120
Impossible!

1648
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:55,580
Did we land it though?

1649
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:57,440
Did we land it?

1650
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,560
Did we land the impossible?

1651
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:03,080
That's so close!

1652
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,020
Raiden, Raiden, please turn around.

1653
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,360
Raiden, I can't see you.

1654
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:06,620
Okay.

1655
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,060
They don't call it the impossible for nothing.

1656
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:12,840
It's mostly for him.

1657
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:14,320
It's for his ego, you know?

1658
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:17,560
They call it the impossible, but it's like the easiest trick ever.

1659
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:19,500
Wouldn't that just make him feel really bad?

1660
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,780
April 30th, my dudes!

1661
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,260
April 30th!

1662
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,000
George Washington!

1663
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:28,100
Oh.

1664
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:28,700
Take it.

1665
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:29,520
Oh.

1666
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,720
There's not much point in being here if you don't play tricks.

1667
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:34,180
Um...

1668
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:36,220
This one was not my best run, I'll be honest.

1669
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:41,240
No.

1670
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,320
What an end.

1671
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:56,520
Truly.

1672
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:09,910
La li lu le lo.

1673
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:10,950
It's a la li lu le lo.

1674
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:12,010
It's a la li lu le lo.

1675
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:13,970
La li lu le lo.

1676
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:15,150
La li lu le lo.

1677
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:16,070
They're...

1678
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:17,530
They're trying to stop me.

1679
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:18,450
The la li lu le lo!

1680
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:23,510
Oh, damn.

1681
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:24,950
I was so close.

1682
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:30,850
Please, Bryden.

1683
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,010
Just get a bit of...

1684
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:33,570
Disaster.

1685
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:34,210
That's mean.

1686
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:36,710
That's what they call me at the club!

1687
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:40,210
Disaster.

1688
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:41,210
Disaster slide.

1689
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:42,270
La li lu.

1690
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:43,930
La li lu le lo.

1691
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:45,110
What's up here?

1692
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:46,570
I haven't been here.

1693
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:48,070
Oh.

1694
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:49,450
Oh.

1695
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:49,930
Oh.

1696
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:51,570
I can't see that hole.

1697
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:53,550
Ha!

1698
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:55,150
Oh, dang it.

1699
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:55,590
Uh-oh.

1700
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:56,170
Uh-oh.

1701
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:56,830
We're in trouble.

1702
01:13:57,170 --> 01:13:57,290
Ah!

1703
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:00,810
Don't shoot!

1704
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:02,150
Don't shoot!

1705
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:06,310
What club?

1706
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:09,590
What

1707
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:13,590
club?

1708
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:13,710
Nice.

1709
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:16,390
Oh, so close.

1710
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:18,910
I also want to get these up here.

1711
01:14:22,370 --> 01:14:24,210
I also want to get these up here.

1712
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,210
He was shooting at me and I was...

1713
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:28,230
Yeah!

1714
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:29,230
Yeah!

1715
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:35,070
He was shooting at me, but I was too busy being awesome!

1716
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:37,890
Yeah, the club.

1717
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:38,690
Obviously.

1718
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:41,010
Please, Bryden.

1719
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:42,730
Let's go upstairs.

1720
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:45,330
Take the stairs now, Bryden.

1721
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:50,890
Here we go!

1722
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:54,370
I take... I phased into the box.

1723
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:57,990
I'm gonna take Cypher down with a skateboard.

1724
01:14:59,170 --> 01:14:59,970
Yeah.

1725
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:01,430
Yeah, I do.

1726
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:04,790
Cypher's got nothing on me.

1727
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:08,210
Well, this...

1728
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:09,310
Those Cyphers...

1729
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:10,730
And...

1730
01:15:10,730 --> 01:15:13,470
And this Cypher...

1731
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:14,650
Wait.

1732
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:15,370
Those... Wait.

1733
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:18,730
Cypher and these Cyphers.

1734
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:22,530
Okay.

1735
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:27,460
That's alright, Bryden.

1736
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:28,640
So, pick it up.

1737
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:28,920
Pick it up.

1738
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:29,380
No.

1739
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:29,860
No.

1740
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:30,320
Wrong way.

1741
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:30,700
There we go.

1742
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:33,440
Up the stairs.

1743
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:36,360
One of my mortal enemies that I can't ever...

1744
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:39,200
get to the stairs.

1745
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:41,340
Warned you about those stairs, bro.

1746
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:42,660
Yeah!

1747
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:47,080
Oh.

1748
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:49,860
Oh.

1749
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,260
Sorry, Bryden.

1750
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,080
Why can't I get this?

1751
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:01,840
But it's so hard for me to get this ration.

1752
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:03,500
Oh my god.

1753
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:04,100
What?

1754
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,200
Why'd you stop, Bryden?

1755
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,320
Why'd you stop?

1756
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,440
Why'd you stop, Bryden?

1757
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:11,380
Why'd you stop?

1758
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:15,680
In the end...

1759
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:18,320
Everything is bad.

1760
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:21,780
I did one.

1761
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:22,420
I just did it.

1762
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:23,800
Come on.

1763
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:24,140
Come on.

1764
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:25,660
Ration!

1765
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:26,100
Oh.

1766
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:26,460
Ration!

1767
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:32,320
Oh.

1768
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:33,400
We didn't get the grind, either.

1769
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,140
I think getting the grind is like...

1770
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:39,700
I think getting the grind is like...

1771
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:40,100
Going...

1772
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:42,800
There and back.

1773
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:43,520
You know what I mean?

1774
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:45,380
Okay.

1775
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:46,580
Like this?

1776
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:48,420
Nice.

1777
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:55,160
Oh.

1778
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,200
Why did you...

1779
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:56,980
Why did you fall?

1780
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:01,460
So close.

1781
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:02,440
It's okay though.

1782
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:04,960
Now we go around this way.

1783
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:06,740
And we waste all this time.

1784
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,060
And we hook!

1785
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,380
We're going so slow!

1786
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:13,420
Oh my god.

1787
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:14,740
Ride in, don't do it.

1788
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:15,440
Don't ride in!

1789
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:21,920
We gotta grind everything we see!

1790
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:24,300
Like we're a bunny or something.

1791
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:30,640
Badass.

1792
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,780
Where's all the bird poop?

1793
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:33,000
That's a good question.

1794
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,160
I took care of those birds.

1795
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:38,400
Nice.

1796
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:39,000
Oh.

1797
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,340
For some reason I keep thinking I gotta go back here.

1798
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:42,060
But I don't.

1799
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:42,660
Not yet.

1800
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:43,800
Not here yet.

1801
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:46,060
Like you're a what?

1802
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:47,380
What do you mean?

1803
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:49,060
Oh!

1804
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:55,210
Let's just pretend we're on the same lap.

1805
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:55,750
I

1806
01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:03,830
didn't want those points!

1807
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:05,550
Anyway!

1808
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:23,100
Ride in.

1809
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:26,180
I need you to... I need you to... you know... my money's on you.

1810
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:26,720
Ride in.

1811
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:28,100
My money's on you.

1812
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,140
I need you to...

1813
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:30,360
Ride in.

1814
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:31,180
I'm gonna go broke.

1815
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:32,340
Ride in.

1816
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,120
Don't you care about me.

1817
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:35,060
Oh!

1818
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:35,980
We got the grind at least.

1819
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:39,740
Ride in.

1820
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:41,500
Lock in.

1821
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:41,980
Ride in.

1822
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:53,760
You know what?

1823
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:54,620
Let's just do this part.

1824
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,400
Oh I don't think we're gonna make it!

1825
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,060
I don't think we're gonna make it!

1826
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,520
I miss him in the game would just tell you, You're bad.

1827
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:05,780
Ride in.

1828
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:06,760
That's a disappointment.

1829
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:13,060
Stop making me so sad!

1830
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:15,040
Ride in.

1831
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:16,840
Ride in.

1832
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,380
You're making Mike sad.

1833
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:28,090
You're making Mike sad.

1834
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:28,570
Oh.

1835
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:29,250
Sorry.

1836
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:29,970
I just realized.

1837
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:38,330
I hate this

1838
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:47,090
guy, I think.

1839
01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:53,110
Oh my gosh, maybe...

1840
01:19:55,770 --> 01:19:56,250
No!

1841
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:58,190
How do I get that one up there?

1842
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:02,410
How do I get that one up there?

1843
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:08,890
C though!

1844
01:20:08,990 --> 01:20:09,730
We got the C!

1845
01:20:10,730 --> 01:20:11,930
We got the C!

1846
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:15,950
If I had just gotten that at the last second, maybe it would have been a B.

1847
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:20,740
Jump?

1848
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,380
I've tried!

1849
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:22,540
You know what?

1850
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,300
We're gonna go practice that one right now.

1851
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,460
We're gonna go straight to it and practice.

1852
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:29,640
This way.

1853
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:30,520
This way.

1854
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:30,860
This way.

1855
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,020
This way.

1856
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:32,340
This way.

1857
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:32,700
This way.

1858
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:33,440
This way.

1859
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:34,140
This way.

1860
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,600
And if I... jump!

1861
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:48,280
Well, that obviously didn't work.

1862
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,720
Hold X and release at the edge of the ramp.

1863
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:51,760
No need to hold forward.

1864
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:00,340
Izar!

1865
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:02,400
Izar my man!

1866
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:03,840
Izar my man!

1867
01:21:09,850 --> 01:21:11,610
That was all you, buddy!

1868
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:18,830
There we go.

1869
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:22,930
Nice so...

1870
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:25,970
Could not see.

1871
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:28,110
Alright.

1872
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:29,850
Let's...

1873
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:32,870
Oh my god.

1874
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:33,230
Please.

1875
01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:35,830
Oh...

1876
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:39,790
We wasted a little bit of time, but... It's OK.

1877
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:43,690
Let's just beat these cyphers.

1878
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:48,750
Woo!

1879
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:49,610
That hurt.

1880
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:51,630
Oh, Raiden?

1881
01:21:52,730 --> 01:21:55,830
Raiden, all we did was... all we did was turn around.

1882
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:05,580
All we did was turn around, man.

1883
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:18,760
Oh.

1884
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,180
Wait, which one's kickflip?

1885
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:22,320
Wait.

1886
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:22,940
Oh, wait.

1887
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:31,260
Kickflip.

1888
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:32,300
It's a kick.

1889
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,780
And then it's a flip.

1890
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:36,480
Oh,

1891
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:39,820
wait.

1892
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:41,500
Raiden.

1893
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:42,440
Oh, Raiden.

1894
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:43,280
Raiden, Raiden.

1895
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:44,880
OMG,

1896
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:52,460
is this real?

1897
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,020
You bet your butt it's real.

1898
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:58,400
What was that?

1899
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,760
Oh, Raiden.

1900
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:04,960
Come on.

1901
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:06,020
Let's go, Raiden.

1902
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,400
What's stock one mean?

1903
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:10,060
Oh, didn't someone say...

1904
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,840
I can do like a special trick or something.

1905
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,540
Does that mean my special is stocked up?

1906
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:17,420
Huh.

1907
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:18,420
Oh.

1908
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:19,740
Wait.

1909
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,920
That's my special meter.

1910
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:24,320
R1!

1911
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,140
Does nothing!

1912
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:27,640
I got another stock!

1913
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,060
But how do I use it?

1914
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:39,180
Hmm.

1915
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:39,600
Nice.

1916
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,120
How do I use it?

1917
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:42,660
Hmm.

1918
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:49,100
Oh, I was gonna say, wait, I got the collection.

1919
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:50,340
No, we didn't at the beginning.

1920
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:50,840
Okay.

1921
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:55,000
I think this time, for real, we can get the collection.

1922
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:58,980
We can get a beef or...

1923
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:01,460
Bud?

1924
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:03,080
Ballad?

1925
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:03,560
Bake?

1926
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:06,580
Burn?

1927
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:08,940
Then I think we'll be good.

1928
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,340
Bows?

1929
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:13,920
Huh!

1930
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:19,990
Wah!

1931
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:24,050
Oh, dang it!

1932
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:24,630
Oh no!

1933
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:25,350
No, no, no!

1934
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:26,050
No, no, no!

1935
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:27,510
Oh no!

1936
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:29,790
Oh gosh!

1937
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:30,590
Oh!

1938
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:31,170
Yippee!

1939
01:24:36,050 --> 01:24:37,170
B for box.

1940
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:39,450
B for...

1941
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:42,090
BJ!

1942
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:44,350
Wait, no, no, no, never mind.

1943
01:24:44,630 --> 01:24:46,790
I was thinking D for DJ, but...

1944
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:47,190
No!

1945
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:51,550
I didn't mean that!

1946
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:07,040
You

1947
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:24,410
guys know D for DJ, right?

1948
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:38,180
Woah!

1949
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:41,660
Okay.

1950
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:43,580
I think I'm normal again.

1951
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:58,150
Yes.

1952
01:25:58,150 --> 01:25:58,950
No.

1953
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:03,090
You don't seem to have enough guts to do any tricks.

1954
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:04,510
Yes, sir.

1955
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:06,290
Disaster slide!

1956
01:26:06,670 --> 01:26:07,570
No, sir.

1957
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:09,930
Oh.

1958
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:11,090
It's Raiden, please!

1959
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:12,890
We only have a minute, Raiden!

1960
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:18,240
There we go.

1961
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:19,840
Yes, sir.

1962
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:21,360
No, sir.

1963
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:23,740
I cannot stop saying that.

1964
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:25,920
I think there's something wrong with my brain.

1965
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,340
I can't just stop saying yes, sir.

1966
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:30,020
No, sir.

1967
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:32,120
Yes, sir.

1968
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:34,360
No, sir.

1969
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:43,870
Oh gosh.

1970
01:26:45,610 --> 01:26:46,170
Oh no!

1971
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:47,970
Actually, this is okay.

1972
01:26:50,370 --> 01:26:52,310
To thank you!

1973
01:26:53,610 --> 01:26:54,090
Yeah!

1974
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:55,970
Oh my god, wait, you guys.

1975
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,530
I just need the score!

1976
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:02,010
I just need the score!

1977
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:19,960
No, no, no, no, please!

1978
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,720
Raiden, Raiden, don't do this to me!

1979
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:46,620
So close!

1980
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:50,220
Oh, so close!

1981
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:50,600
So close!

1982
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,700
Oh my gosh!

1983
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:57,020
No, not B for BJ!

1984
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:57,660
No!

1985
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:01,680
Not B!

1986
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:05,460
But we got the B!

1987
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,120
B, B, B, B!

1988
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,500
We got the B!

1989
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,560
We got the B!

1990
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:20,200
We got the B!

1991
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:21,780
You're making progress!

1992
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:22,880
Yeah, baby!

1993
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:27,120
Yeah, baby!

1994
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:30,780
Yes, sir.

1995
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,600
It takes a well-balanced individual to grind the rails.

1996
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,840
B for ghost boos.

1997
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:37,980
Boo, boo, boo!

1998
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:39,360
Yeah!

1999
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:39,840
Boo!

2000
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:40,600
Boo!

2001
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,620
Oh, I'm sweating so much.

2002
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:46,000
Do you guys mind if I go get some more water?

2003
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:49,220
Here, you can watch the replay.

2004
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:50,820
While I go get more water.

2005
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:52,220
I'll be right back.

2006
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:53,320
Here, I'll even get rid of this.

2007
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:56,900
B, R, B.

2008
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,560
B, R, B!

2009
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:03,540
B, R, B.

2010
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:04,760
Wait a second.

2011
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:07,000
I just joined the stream for the BJ.

2012
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:07,400
No!

2013
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:31,560
Wait, I might need to go change.

2014
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:32,640
No!

2015
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:33,460
Why

2016
01:30:36,650 --> 01:30:38,070
is my dress all wrinkly?

2017
01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:40,090
I

2018
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:50,500
think I sat weird and it's all wrinkly.

2019
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:51,780
Oh, no.

2020
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:54,780
Wait, I'm gonna go change.

2021
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:56,680
I'll be right back.

2022
01:30:56,940 --> 01:30:57,640
Okay, again.

2023
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:59,120
B, R, B, part two.

2024
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:00,040
I'm so sorry.

2025
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:01,680
B, R, B, part two!

2026
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:02,240
Hold on.

2027
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:04,420
I'm gonna restart it for those who missed it.

2028
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:05,220
Right?

2029
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:06,480
Restart.

2030
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:07,460
There we go.

2031
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:07,700
Okay.

2032
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:08,540
All right, B, R, B.

2033
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,480
I have T-minus three minutes.

2034
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,120
Into my shirt.

2035
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:06,640
Okay, I'm so sorry, you guys.

2036
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:07,060
I'm so sorry.

2037
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:09,800
Okay, okay, okay.

2038
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:11,060
Exit.

2039
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:11,580
All right.

2040
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:17,800
I changed into my hungry for snake T-shirt.

2041
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:21,220
I realized I don't have any MGS2 T-shirts.

2042
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:24,160
I have only MGS3.

2043
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:28,160
I have MGS4, MGS3, Peace Walker.

2044
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,660
I didn't buy the one from Uniqlo because I didn't like it.

2045
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:41,220
The blue on it is so blue.

2046
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:43,700
It's so blue.

2047
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,360
Like it's way too blue.

2048
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:48,100
I'll never...

2049
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:49,120
I'll never wear it.

2050
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,160
I'll never wear it.

2051
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:55,180
I do have one that says Solidus on it.

2052
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,240
Maybe I should have worn that instead.

2053
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:02,360
Oh, the fat man!

2054
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:04,740
My laughing gross.

2055
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:10,100
Alright, guys.

2056
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:18,600
Today's stream is actually going to be pretty short.

2057
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:26,720
How did you know I had that t-shirt?

2058
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:29,120
Actually, it's not a t-shirt.

2059
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:29,960
But, you know.

2060
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:32,060
How did you know I had a shirt that said that?

2061
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:32,600
It happened real fast.

2062
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:34,940
It's because I love Fat Man so much, you know?

2063
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,200
Min, do you know what day it is today?

2064
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:41,320
April 30th?

2065
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:44,980
It's shredding day!

2066
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:47,640
Every MGS fan has it.

2067
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:48,580
Oh, okay, okay.

2068
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:59,640
But, I believe this is the round where we'll get an A.

2069
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,480
For that ass!

2070
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:08,900
Let's go!

2071
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:10,180
Let's grind!

2072
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:11,800
All the way!

2073
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:13,540
To...

2074
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:15,420
Dinner, baby!

2075
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:18,620
Oh, ouch!

2076
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,500
That was not what I expected.

2077
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:24,420
Wait, why are you facing this way?

2078
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:29,640
Okay, we're close, we're close.

2079
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:32,380
April 30th!

2080
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:33,320
So right.

2081
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:34,880
Why didn't I think of that?

2082
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:37,940
You should be the streamer.

2083
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:39,300
Not me!

2084
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:40,580
Oh!

2085
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,440
Ew!

2086
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:45,340
Ew, ew, the camera.

2087
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:46,680
It's okay.

2088
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,480
It should be you on this livestream!

2089
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:01,800
Not me!

2090
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:03,320
Nice!

2091
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:15,480
Why do you not land the kickflips right in?

2092
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,620
You're killing me!

2093
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,500
You're tearing me apart!

2094
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:20,800
Right in!

2095
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:25,360
Oh!

2096
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:27,720
That was...

2097
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:28,860
That was so wet!

2098
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:30,160
Please, Raiden.

2099
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:33,760
Hold on, I'm coming back over here to get...

2100
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:34,940
Oh, never mind.

2101
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:35,740
You know what?

2102
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:36,300
Screw it.

2103
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:40,320
Sending Gray Fox?

2104
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:45,300
It's like when you play as Gray Fox in VR missions.

2105
01:36:51,950 --> 01:36:52,610
I did!

2106
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:55,530
Raiden's bloody skin mark.

2107
01:36:56,330 --> 01:36:57,530
What do you mean by that?

2108
01:36:59,790 --> 01:37:00,670
Oh, my gosh.

2109
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:01,310
Oh, my gosh.

2110
01:37:01,410 --> 01:37:03,210
I don't think this is the run, you guys.

2111
01:37:04,350 --> 01:37:04,770
Um...

2112
01:37:05,430 --> 01:37:06,090
Uh-oh.

2113
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:07,650
Uh-oh.

2114
01:37:10,370 --> 01:37:12,830
I don't know if this is the run, but we'll try.

2115
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:14,870
Oh, wrong way.

2116
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:15,990
Oh, my gosh.

2117
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:19,410
This is...

2118
01:37:19,410 --> 01:37:19,870
We'll try.

2119
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:22,090
Oh...

2120
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:34,040
Okay.

2121
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:35,420
Come on.

2122
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:36,660
Oh, whoa.

2123
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:38,720
Alright, we'll go back up the stairs.

2124
01:37:48,450 --> 01:37:51,530
I held on, but it...

2125
01:37:56,050 --> 01:37:56,490
Uh...

2126
01:37:56,490 --> 01:37:58,290
But we haven't even gotten that one.

2127
01:37:58,430 --> 01:38:00,150
Yo, this is not the run at all.

2128
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:01,190
That's okay.

2129
01:38:03,490 --> 01:38:04,730
Good job, Raiden.

2130
01:38:06,990 --> 01:38:07,430
Nice.

2131
01:38:07,450 --> 01:38:08,370
Good job, Raiden.

2132
01:38:08,670 --> 01:38:09,750
Turn around, Raiden.

2133
01:38:13,050 --> 01:38:13,730
Ouchy ouch.

2134
01:38:15,910 --> 01:38:16,690
That's okay!

2135
01:38:17,610 --> 01:38:18,730
That we didn't make it.

2136
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:19,250
That's okay.

2137
01:38:19,450 --> 01:38:19,890
That's okay.

2138
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:21,890
We didn't get the grind, either.

2139
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:24,370
Yeah.

2140
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:26,550
We're getting consistencies, though.

2141
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:27,870
Not so bad.

2142
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:28,750
Okay.

2143
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:29,970
Here we go.

2144
01:38:31,090 --> 01:38:31,530
How

2145
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:42,880
do I use my special?

2146
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,880
Oh, if only I hadn't crashed, we would've made that.

2147
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:50,900
Ooh.

2148
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:52,480
This one's fancy.

2149
01:38:54,980 --> 01:38:55,780
Nice.

2150
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:02,840
Nice.

2151
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:08,460
Nice.

2152
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:08,460
Nice.

2153
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:16,940
Okay.

2154
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:17,840
There we go.

2155
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:19,160
Speedrun.

2156
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:19,680
Speedrun.

2157
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:20,100
Speedrun.

2158
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:25,380
Nice.

2159
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:28,040
Nice.

2160
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:28,780
Nice.

2161
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:31,020
Nice.

2162
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:34,780
Okay.

2163
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:37,960
Kickflip.

2164
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:39,560
Kickflip, my beloved.

2165
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:43,000
Kickflip,

2166
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:49,170
my beloved.

2167
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:49,750
Kickflip, my beloved.

2168
01:39:57,390 --> 01:39:58,070
Nice.

2169
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:00,450
Nice.

2170
01:40:00,710 --> 01:40:01,050
Nice.

2171
01:40:01,050 --> 01:40:01,970
Oh, not nice.

2172
01:40:02,510 --> 01:40:04,090
We still need to grind, though.

2173
01:40:04,270 --> 01:40:04,490
We still need to grind, though.

2174
01:40:06,010 --> 01:40:06,630
Come on.

2175
01:40:06,710 --> 01:40:07,190
Raiden.

2176
01:40:07,290 --> 01:40:07,510
Raiden.

2177
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:07,730
Raiden.

2178
01:40:08,950 --> 01:40:09,670
I know.

2179
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:10,390
I'm trying.

2180
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:10,830
I'm trying.

2181
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:11,610
I'm trying.

2182
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:12,950
Mister, please.

2183
01:40:17,470 --> 01:40:17,950
Okay.

2184
01:40:26,470 --> 01:40:28,210
When we go back down, we'll get that.

2185
01:40:28,930 --> 01:40:29,410
Probably.

2186
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:34,300
Jump!

2187
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:36,060
Oh!

2188
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:38,000
Okay.

2189
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:39,400
Turn around.

2190
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:41,400
Jump!

2191
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:43,100
Yeah!

2192
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:48,820
Okay.

2193
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:51,520
Let's go get these over here.

2194
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:59,520
Still have to make a lot of points, though.

2195
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:03,300
Tail slide!

2196
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:05,600
Oh!

2197
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:07,660
Okay, that got us a lot.

2198
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:08,020
Nice.

2199
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:09,940
Let's just do it again.

2200
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,060
Yes!

2201
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:16,080
Yes!

2202
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:16,480
Yes!

2203
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:18,140
Yes!

2204
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:18,720
No!

2205
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:22,400
Oh!

2206
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,560
That works.

2207
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:24,240
That works.

2208
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:24,720
That works.

2209
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:25,180
That works!

2210
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:27,240
Ha!

2211
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:29,740
Ha!

2212
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:31,880
Oh, no.

2213
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:32,600
Oh, no, no, no.

2214
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:33,860
Please.

2215
01:41:53,860 --> 01:41:55,360
We did it!

2216
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:58,260
Let's go!

2217
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,460
Oh my god!

2218
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:05,080
Oh!

2219
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:17,200
April 30th!

2220
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:26,140
Oh my gosh...

2221
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:29,300
Oh my gosh...

2222
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:37,580
You guys...

2223
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:39,300
It is time...

2224
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:41,940
to do the final part of April 30th.

2225
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:45,300
While we watch...

2226
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:49,780
my awesome run.

2227
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:53,580
While we watch my awesome run.

2228
01:42:55,940 --> 01:42:57,100
Punch Solidus?

2229
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,160
No, not yet.

2230
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:00,620
I love that guy.

2231
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:02,200
Hold on one second.

2232
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:04,180
Here we go.

2233
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:10,210
Okay.

2234
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:13,910
Well guys, thank you very much for joining me for...

2235
01:43:13,910 --> 01:43:19,340
for this super awesome, super cool, super sick...

2236
01:43:20,750 --> 01:43:21,950
time today.

2237
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:27,230
I hope that you had an awesome April 30th.

2238
01:43:27,470 --> 01:43:28,970
And remember...

2239
01:43:28,970 --> 01:43:32,250
that the Patriots will never win.

2240
01:43:33,950 --> 01:43:35,810
It was time to watch King Kong.

2241
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:36,910
No.

2242
01:43:37,410 --> 01:43:39,250
It's time for our final...

2243
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:40,310
our final part.

2244
01:43:41,230 --> 01:43:42,550
Actually, I'm gonna restart this.

2245
01:43:43,890 --> 01:43:44,490
Restart.

2246
01:43:44,670 --> 01:43:45,330
There we go.

2247
01:43:45,890 --> 01:43:46,190
Okay.

2248
01:43:46,190 --> 01:43:49,370
I will sing to you...

2249
01:43:49,370 --> 01:43:50,190
a song.

2250
01:44:11,980 --> 01:44:33,920
I stare at the stars and the sky up above and think what am I made of Am I full of...

2251
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:35,200
Am I full of sorrow?

2252
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:39,160
Am I hurt and pain?

2253
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:45,400
Or am I filled with love?

2254
01:44:46,260 --> 01:45:08,960
I walk by myself on the streets below And ask every child I know Do you think tomorrow I'll nail that kickflip?

2255
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:14,820
Which one, which trick will go?

2256
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:44,340
I can't say goodbye to yesterday, my friend I keep holding on Till the end Out of the darkness There is no other way Than the light leading to yesterday

2257
01:45:49,160 --> 01:46:04,720
It's there That I'll find Inner peace Please, not more than dreams that I let slip away.

2258
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:06,480
Joan, please!

2259
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:19,240
I will find the ration I'm looking for way back in yesterday.

2260
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:24,520
I

2261
01:46:27,810 --> 01:46:30,070
forgot my saxophone.

2262
01:46:30,530 --> 01:46:32,450
This is cinnamon.

2263
01:46:41,150 --> 01:46:42,550
Why

2264
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:36,380
can't each of us in the world ever see the best things in life are free?

2265
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:39,120
Why can't each of us in the world ever see the best things in life are free?

2266
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:51,680
Little sounds of laughter, a warm hug, a smile, a kickflip from you to me.

2267
01:47:53,940 --> 01:48:01,380
I fall to my knees, I cry and I cry.

2268
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:07,160
Why couldn't I just fly?

2269
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:09,120
Oh, my scapegoat!

2270
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:13,180
Happy ever after.

2271
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:17,340
Please stay for a while.

2272
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:23,460
Make time refuse to fly.

2273
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:32,500
I can't say goodbye to yesterday, my friend.

2274
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:38,180
Cause I know how good it has been.

2275
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:47,820
Facing forever, here I stand, come what may.

2276
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:53,340
In the old and the new, yesterday.

2277
01:48:58,850 --> 01:49:07,290
It's there that I'll find inner peace, not war.

2278
01:49:07,290 --> 01:49:13,630
And boards that I let slip away.

2279
01:49:15,050 --> 01:49:24,710
I will find the joyfulness I'm looking for today.

2280
01:49:26,290 --> 01:49:29,730
April 30th.

2281
01:49:31,990 --> 01:49:33,310
Whoa.

2282
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:35,930
Here it comes.

2283
01:49:36,270 --> 01:49:36,390
Oh!

2284
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:37,650
Come on.

2285
01:49:38,630 --> 01:49:39,230
Whop.

2286
01:49:40,370 --> 01:49:40,970
Wholololol.

2287
01:49:50,210 --> 01:49:51,810
This is a trumpet.

2288
01:49:53,230 --> 01:49:54,730
This is not a saxophone.

2289
01:49:54,870 --> 01:49:55,930
The saxities.

2290
01:50:06,290 --> 01:50:07,510
Thank you, guys, again.

2291
01:50:07,790 --> 01:50:08,850
That's a trombone?

2292
01:50:08,850 --> 01:50:09,010
Trombone?

2293
01:50:09,150 --> 01:50:09,650
Oh.

2294
01:50:10,970 --> 01:50:12,690
That's a trombone, but we don't have a...

2295
01:50:15,070 --> 01:50:16,710
Hold on, I'm gonna skate with him.

2296
01:50:18,750 --> 01:50:19,950
I'm gonna skate with him.

2297
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:21,490
Oh.

2298
01:50:22,290 --> 01:50:22,790
Yeah!

2299
01:50:23,930 --> 01:50:24,430
Wow!

2300
01:50:25,890 --> 01:50:26,930
Here I go!

2301
01:50:28,470 --> 01:50:28,970
Wow!

2302
01:50:31,890 --> 01:50:32,390
Wow!

2303
01:50:35,010 --> 01:50:35,510
Yeah!

2304
01:50:35,510 --> 01:50:35,830
Yeah!

2305
01:50:38,030 --> 01:50:38,570
Yeah!

2306
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:45,010
Oh.

2307
01:50:45,150 --> 01:50:58,060
Here we go, here we go.

2308
01:50:58,630 --> 01:50:59,960
Oh, I tried.

2309
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:00,300
Yeah!

2310
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:06,880
Kickflip!

2311
01:51:07,340 --> 01:51:08,120
Keep going!

2312
01:51:08,340 --> 01:51:09,300
Keep going riding!

2313
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:10,940
Yes!

2314
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:28,800
I can't say goodbye to yesterday, my friend.

2315
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:32,120
Oh.

2316
01:51:33,540 --> 01:51:34,960
We're okay, we're okay.

2317
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:37,720
Wow!

2318
01:51:44,550 --> 01:51:45,010
Uh...

2319
01:51:45,950 --> 01:51:46,590
That's it.

2320
01:51:47,030 --> 01:51:47,890
That's the stream.

2321
01:51:48,690 --> 01:51:49,470
Thank you guys.

2322
01:51:50,010 --> 01:51:50,470
Again.

2323
01:51:50,850 --> 01:51:51,750
I hope you had fun.

2324
01:51:52,410 --> 01:51:52,870
Um...

2325
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:54,590
Happy April 30th.

2326
01:51:55,630 --> 01:51:56,750
From me to you.

2327
01:51:57,710 --> 01:51:58,630
And um...

2328
01:51:59,430 --> 01:52:00,350
So gnarly.

2329
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:04,030
Thanks for the stream.

2330
01:52:04,130 --> 01:52:04,650
Thank you guys.

2331
01:52:05,390 --> 01:52:06,810
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

2332
01:52:06,990 --> 01:52:10,050
Actually, I will be collabing with Giri on her channel.

2333
01:52:10,270 --> 01:52:10,730
Um...

2334
01:52:10,730 --> 01:52:12,050
I don't...

2335
01:52:12,050 --> 01:52:13,950
Actually, I think I can stream tomorrow.

2336
01:52:15,410 --> 01:52:16,130
I don't know.

2337
01:52:16,390 --> 01:52:17,990
I think I'll stream tomorrow, probably.

2338
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:20,790
Gonna tell you now you are not beating the cute allegations.

2339
01:52:21,070 --> 01:52:21,550
What is that?

2340
01:52:21,590 --> 01:52:22,190
What do you mean?

2341
01:52:22,890 --> 01:52:23,710
I'm not cool?

2342
01:52:23,890 --> 01:52:24,430
I mean cute?

2343
01:52:24,510 --> 01:52:25,090
I'm cool!

2344
01:52:26,310 --> 01:52:26,710
Wow!

2345
01:52:30,270 --> 01:52:30,670
Yeah!

2346
01:52:30,670 --> 01:52:30,910
Here we go.

2347
01:52:32,850 --> 01:52:33,250
Yeah!

2348
01:52:35,890 --> 01:52:36,290
Wow!

2349
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:39,680
Yeah!

2350
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:41,400
Nevermind.

2351
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:41,420
It's fine.

2352
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:43,480
I was gonna take that but I didn't.

2353
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:52,940
Okay.

2354
01:52:59,810 --> 01:53:01,170
130th Happy Metal Gear Day!

2355
01:53:03,210 --> 01:53:04,730
Again, I'll probably stream tomorrow.

2356
01:53:05,870 --> 01:53:06,890
I don't know what yet.

2357
01:53:06,970 --> 01:53:08,310
I'll put up a waiting room...

2358
01:53:09,190 --> 01:53:11,670
tomorrow morning probably after the GD collab.

2359
01:53:11,950 --> 01:53:12,830
So, yeah.

2360
01:53:14,150 --> 01:53:15,150
Thank you everybody!

2361
01:53:15,850 --> 01:53:18,150
I know it's silly but this stream has been the coolest thing.

2362
01:53:18,210 --> 01:53:18,950
And the song just wow.

2363
01:53:19,150 --> 01:53:19,750
Thank you so much.

2364
01:53:21,050 --> 01:53:21,970
Thank you so much!

2365
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:23,790
Thank you!

2366
01:53:50,270 --> 01:53:52,090
Isn't it so awesome we also got the A?

2367
01:53:53,370 --> 01:53:55,970
I'll try and get an A on Snake's map too.

2368
01:53:56,510 --> 01:53:58,690
But I think I'm way better now than I was before.

2369
01:53:59,330 --> 01:54:00,450
I think I can do it.

2370
01:54:00,510 --> 01:54:01,510
Also, oh my gosh, you guys!

2371
01:54:03,110 --> 01:54:04,090
Close to 200k.

2372
01:54:04,450 --> 01:54:06,550
I have to think of something to do for 200k!

2373
01:54:06,950 --> 01:54:07,330
Uh oh.

2374
01:54:08,950 --> 01:54:09,730

2377
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:29,260

01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:32,180

2380
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:33,400

01:54:35,780 --> 01:54:36,520

2382
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:38,460

01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,740

01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:51,000
I'm gonna eat 200k calories.

2388
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:52,760
Perfect.

2389
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:55,660
No elation 200 times.

2390
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:57,080
You would want that, wouldn't you?

01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:42,460
