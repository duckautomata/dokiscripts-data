1
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,460
Shika no ko no ko no ko ko shi tan tan.

2
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,000
Shika no ko no ko no ko no ko shi tan tan.

3
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,020
No!

4
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:56,880
No!

5
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,180
No.

6
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,300
Shika

7
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,170
no ko no ko ko shi tan tan.

8
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,890
She's freaking out.

9
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,790
I'm always freaking out.

10
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,410
Oh my god!

11
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,350
Don't add me to your friends list!

12
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,290
That was a notification of people trying to add me to a friends list!

13
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,490
Get out of here!

14
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,290
Get out of here!

15
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,950
My voice is really bad today.

16
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,530
Oh my goodness.

17
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,000
Hello everyone!

18
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,950
Get out of here!

19
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,610
Get out of here!

20
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,830
Get out of here!

21
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,830
Oh my gosh.

22
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,390
Oh my god.

23
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,870
She's down with the sickness.

24
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,350
Actually, no!

25
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,350
I'm... oh my god.

26
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,250
Of course if I say something...

27
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,590
You guys will all be freaking about it.

28
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,550
You guys will all be freaking about it.

29
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:33,830
But no!

30
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,690
Well, I was gonna say I'm all better.

31
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,550
But no!

32
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,550
Well, I was gonna say I'm all better.

33
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,190
But I'm not all better.

34
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,430
I still have a cough.

35
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,530
Jason will have a membership.

36
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,810
Jason will have a membership.

37
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,290
The Japanese... with what?

38
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,730
Brain rot is real.

39
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,230
Shika no ko no ko no ko shi tan tan.

40
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:51,750
Shika no ko no ko no ko shi tan tan.

41
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,830
Minto minto...

42
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,570
Minto minto minto minto...

43
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,590
Minto phantom.

44
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,370
Doesn't really roll off the tongue very well though.

45
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,970
Welcome to Tatrio!

46
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,770
It's been a long time since I've...

47
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,030
Since I've played this before.

48
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,090
It's been a really, really, really...

49
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,910
Really, really, really, really long time.

50
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,510
Still don't understand the deer meme?

51
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,430
What is there to understand?

52
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,270
It's just a catchy song, that's all.

53
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,150
Hello.

54
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,970
Minto minto minto minto...

55
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:35,970
Minto phantom.

56
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,130
Thank you.

57
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,850
We wisps take after you.

58
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,970
We have no choice but to be freaky.

59
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,470
And clowny, apparently.

60
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,570
Yeah, it's just an earworm.

61
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,330
From an anime.

62
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,550
What round did you get to?

63
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,150
Ambulance?

64
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,170
I think it was 165?

65
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:57,650
I...

66
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,430
I think so.

67
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,270
Mint is good at Tatrio?

68
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,910
Of

69
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,320
course I am.

70
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,820
Of course I am!

71
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,700
She's a world champion.

72
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,620
Of the digital world.

73
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,700
I'm the digital world champion.

74
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,280
I'm the digital world champion.

75
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:41,540
I'm the one who sent you digital monsters to save the digital world.

76
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,280
But yeah...

77
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,140
I'm the one who sent you digital monsters to save the digital world.

78
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,400
Move aside firestorm.

79
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,060
Mint's in town now.

80
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,320
I don't even know who that is.

81
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,100
I don't even know who that is.

82
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,680
I think.

83
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,740
That's how insignificant they are to me.

84
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,400
I just figured it's a Friday...

85
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,420
It's a Friday...

86
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,840
night.

87
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,040
And I haven't played this in literally years.

88
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,800
With you guys.

89
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,400
Sorry, Minto lovers.

90
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,300
You just made that account now.

91
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,320
Minto lover.

92
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,560
The one hour deer song is giving me a migraine.

93
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,880
What the?

94
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,300
You can message me even?

95
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,340
Get out of here!

96
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,540
I don't think you should listen to it for an actual migraine.

97
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:51,960
Maybe.

98
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,000
You know?

99
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,260
I think...

100
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,120
It's not meant for that.

101
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,500
How are you guys doing this?

102
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,520
You're not my friends!

103
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:04,940
Hi!

104
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,990
There's a streamer mode?

105
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,330
Okay, I'm gonna streamer mode.

106
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,630
Hold on, let me hide my screen.

107
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,590
Hold on.

108
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,730
Where is it?

109
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,690
I just have to find it.

110
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,450
Um...

111
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,410
I'm gonna turn off notifications real quick.

112
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:35,870
Also.

113
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,510
Let's see.

114
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,310
Oh, I cannot turn them off.

115
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:44,850
Really?

116
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,490
Oh wait, here we go.

117
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,350
Notify me.

118
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:48,730
Off.

119
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,150
Off.

120
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,590
Off.

121
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:51,610
Off.

122
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,190
Off.

123
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:53,830
Off.

124
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,270
Off.

125
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:54,770
Off.

126
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,050
Off.

127
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,430
Off.

128
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,390
Off.

129
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:58,750
Off.

130
00:09:59,290 --> 00:09:59,410
Off.

131
00:09:59,410 --> 00:09:59,630
Off.

132
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,430
Off.

133
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:00,470
Off.

134
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,850
Off.

135
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:00,910
Off.

136
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:00,990
Off.

137
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:00,990
Off.

138
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,750
Is there a streamer mode?

139
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,330
No cussing in my chat.

140
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,810
Can you be my dear friend?

141
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,590
Oh, what's that?

142
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,950
Someone gave me one month of Tetrio supporter!

143
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,050
Stop it!

144
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,710
Freaking

145
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:32,940
cussing!

146
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,560
You freaking freaks!

147
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,420
Any time that I would get mad at Mataro while we were together...

148
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,040
Any time I would get mad at her...

149
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,500
She would be like, you freaking freaks!

150
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,820
That's what you sound like.

151
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,200
You freaking freaks!

152
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,620
That's what you sound like right now, Mint.

153
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,840
She would do that every time.

154
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,440
When will you learn?

155
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,280
Attractions have consequences!

156
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,540
I don't think there is a streamer.

157
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,060
Unless I'm blind.

158
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,980
Which is...

159
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,240
I mean, it might be these glasses, to be honest.

160
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,660
It's my favorite YouTube video.

161
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,000
It's a classic, truly.

162
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,160
I've been wanting to catch a Mint stream.

163
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Glad to have made it.

164
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,120
Welcome!

165
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,020
What's with the shades?

166
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,740
I just thought they were cool.

167
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,100
You're blocking the messages now.

168
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,980
So maybe it's okay.

169
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,580
Maybe now.

170
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,020
Yeah, maybe.

171
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:37,900
Okay.

172
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,170
Yeah, I'm cool.

173
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,050
I'm cool now.

174
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,570
But I'm still getting notifications when somebody has me.

175
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,630
Two months, baby!

176
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:54,450
Yippee!

177
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,630
Wait, under account you can edit your privacy settings.

178
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,290
Oh, I can?

179
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,110
Okay, thank you.

180
00:11:59,230 --> 00:11:59,710
Hold on.

181
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:01,570
Sorry.

182
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,430
I didn't know it'd be like this!

183
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:05,850
Wait.

184
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,810
Under accounts, a privacy set...

185
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:08,950
Where?

186
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:09,330
Wait.

187
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:09,870
Oh!

188
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,010
Change account settings.

189
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,090
Okay, hold on.

190
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,350
Hold on.

191
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,590
Write a little something about me.

192
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,450
Who can add me as a friend?

193
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,450
My friends can only add me as a friend.

194
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:24,490
Nobody.

195
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,470
Oh, wait.

196
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:28,850
Oh, no.

197
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,070
I think I have to do this.

198
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:38,350
I think I have to do everybody can see what room I'm in so that we can all play together.

199
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,550
Who can send me direct messages?

200
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,110
Nobody!

201
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,130
Nobody!

202
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:44,710
Nobody!

203
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:45,250
Nobody!

204
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:46,830
Okay.

205
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,770
There we go.

206
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,830
Quit talking to me!

207
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:56,710
What the?

208
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,150
Still adding me, though.

209
00:12:59,410 --> 00:12:59,990
Wait.

210
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,310
Streamer mode is...

211
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,430
It's under configuration desktop.

212
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:08,790
Desktop?

213
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,350
I don't see it.

214
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,470
Hmm.

215
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,860
Desktop.

216
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,480
Oh, it's for desktop version, not browser.

217
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,380
Oh, okay.

218
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,500
Okay, anyway.

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,780
It should be fine now, I think.

220
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,480
Okay.

221
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,060
Let's...

222
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,720
I'm gonna do a little bit of a warm-up.

223
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,580
Okay?

224
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,020
I'm gonna do a bit of a warm-up.

225
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,680
Don't be shocked by my Zen level, okay?

226
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,220
Or anything like that.

227
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,560
I also made this account today.

228
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,560
I made this account today.

229
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,220
So...

230
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,660
Do 40 lines?

231
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,220
No, we're gonna...

232
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,320
Uh...

233
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,760
Yeah, I had to make a smurf account.

234
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,480
Mint deleted her old account.

235
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:12,960
I did!

236
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,640
I actually tried to log in back into it, and it was like, this account is deleted.

237
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,220
So I had to make a whole new one, baby.

238
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,080
Which I was really happy this wasn't taking my name.

239
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,400
Yeah.

240
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,940
So, you know.

241
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,100
I deleted my old account.

242
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,140
I nuked it.

243
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,820
Yeah, I was...

244
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,660
It's gone.

245
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,160
I scrubbed it from the internet.

246
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,080
So nobody could ever, ever see.

247
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,640
A fresh start.

248
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,540
Anyway.

249
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,340
Chat summary is wild.

250
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,900
What is Mint Zen mode?

251
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:55,740
Why...

252
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,360
Does it like...

253
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
Does it...

254
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,340
Does it take what I say or only what the chat says?

255
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:03,980
Weird.

256
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:06,900
Anyway.

257
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,720
If you're gonna come in here and be a big old jerk to me...

258
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,120
You can go be a jerk in someone else's chat.

259
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,580
That's all I'm gonna say.

260
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,670
Look at that!

261
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:23,950
Wait.

262
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:24,470
Oh, shoot.

263
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,270
Wait.

264
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:26,770
Oh, there we go.

265
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,030
Okay.

266
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,190
And then...

267
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,150
Nope.

268
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:29,970
Oh, shoot.

269
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:30,310
Oh.

270
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,370
It's space.

271
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,110
Wow.

272
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,990
Look at this.

273
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,250
It's this base rift.

274
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,050
It's kind of...

275
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,730
And then shift.

276
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,730
You guys can't be adding me while I'm practicing.

277
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:41,330
Okay?

278
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,330
You guys...

279
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,550
Chill out.

280
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,070
Okay?

281
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,670
Chill out.

282
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:47,870
Okay?

283
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,630
I was...

284
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,050
I was...

285
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,770
I took the screenshot earlier of my...

286
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,710
Of my...

287
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:57,770
Thumbnail.

288
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,270
Do you guys like my thumbnail?

289
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,760
Do you guys like that?

290
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,840
Pretty nifty, eh?

291
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:10,780
Yeah.

292
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,060
Tetris is fun.

293
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,540
Tetris is a bit stressful for me.

294
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,780
But I do enjoy it.

295
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,900
I mostly enjoy just being able to play games with you guys.

296
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:30,320
So, even if I'm bad at something, I just choose it because I'm like, well, I at least have something to play with people.

297
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,260
So...

298
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,960
To me, it doesn't really matter if I'm good or bad.

299
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,500
I'm just kind of...

300
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:36,740
I'm just...

301
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,400
I'm just vibing.

302
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:44,780
And we can all vibe together on this lovely Friday.

303
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,020
You know?

304
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,000
I didn't trust myself to keep building that.

305
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,000
Wow!

306
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,860
Murphy!

307
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,980
My day is pay.

308
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,620
And my Oshii is cute.

309
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,900
You know it.

310
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,820
You know it.

311
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,700
You know it.

312
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,320
You know it.

313
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:06,720
You know it.

314
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,560
Thank you for that.

315
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,340
Why'd you send that?

316
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,500
Why'd you send that?

317
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,160
See my happy birthday!

318
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,100
Sing me...

319
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:17,520
Hold on.

320
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,820
Here.

321
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,260
I'm just...

322
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,260
I'm practicing real quick.

323
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,460
Give me a second.

324
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,040
Give me like one minute.

325
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,380
Okay.

326
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,780
Give me like one minute.

327
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,560
Square block.

328
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,600
Oh.

329
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,460
There we go.

330
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,620
Good.

331
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,560
This is pretty clean though.

332
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:34,920
Isn't it?

333
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,400
Didn't you say?

334
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,700
Clean.

335
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,020
I remember one advice someone gave me a long time ago in the past.

336
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:49,540
They were like, this one, these Z blocks, don't put them vertical if you can help it.

337
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,740
Is that still a true statement?

338
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,120
Yes.

339
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,000
Or no.

340
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:55,780
Disgust.

341
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,240
Like that.

342
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,220
Don't put it like that.

343
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,920
Build flat.

344
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,350
No.

345
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,350
I think the meta changed.

346
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:09,970
That's the...

347
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:10,910
That's all I know.

348
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,070
Now what?

349
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,890
Don't destroy chat.

350
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,690
You know, I'm...

351
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,790
This is a glorified Zatudan stream.

352
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:23,530
So...

353
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,790
Okay.

354
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,930
I think I've practiced enough.

355
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,610
I think I've practiced enough.

356
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,200
Let's see.

357
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,580
Where'd you go?

358
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,480
D.O.I.

359
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,600
Boss, you think of us as people.

360
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,680
Sorry.

361
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,100
Sorry.

362
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,480
I didn't mean to say that.

363
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,560
I didn't mean to let that slip.

364
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:56,700
Could you please favor me with the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, and the creamy middles of one of your famous birthday greetings?

365
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,200
Happy birthday to you.

366
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,840
Happy birthday to you.

367
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,240
Happy birthday, dear D.O.I.

368
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:13,700
D.O.I.

369
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:13,740
D.O.I.

370
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,140
D.O.I.

371
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,280
D.O.I.

372
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:14,620
D .O.I.

373
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:14,960
D .O .I.

374
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
D.O.I.

375
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,640
Happy birthday to you.

376
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,500
Happy

377
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:28,430
birthday, dear D.O.I.

378
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:28,790
D.O.I.

379
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,590
My voice is cracking a lot today.

380
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,510
I

381
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,380
don't remember how to do this...

382
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,020
Multiplayer.

383
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,180
I think I create a room, right?

384
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,540
Play by my rules.

385
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,260
So, if I create a public room...

386
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,620
Oh, made mince room.

387
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,020
Oh!

388
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,340
Pa-sam!

389
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,160
Oh, I did it.

390
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,630
Super Lobby!

391
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,670
I think I've only ever had that once before.

392
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,870
What is this lobby?

393
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:25,410
Uh oh, I think there's people gonna come in that don't know who I am.

394
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,320
Uh oh.

395
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,860
And it keeps going!

396
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,980
I can hear it very faintly.

397
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,680
If you win, you get a permanent badge to show you wanted a room with 100 plus people.

398
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,340
Try to win.

399
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,520
I want that!

400
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,280
This is a good thing no context mint is the best.

401
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,960
Look up maid mint on YouTube channel!

402
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,580
200 people.

403
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,940
It keeps going.

404
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,410
Hello maid mint, why are they calling me out?

405
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,430
You are so pro VTuber.

406
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,570
Wait, I'm scared.

407
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:35,770
Who are these people?

408
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,430
If you are unsure how we have 100 players, it's a lobby.

409
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,310
How to survive it.

410
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:47,310
Wait, why are there people in here being like...

411
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:53,350
There's people in here being like, this is why there's so many people playing.

412
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,970
I don't know, is there a limit in this room?

413
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:00,930
Is there a limit?

414
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,290
We're just gonna let everybody in who wants to join.

415
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,450
Hey, don't quit.

416
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,070
I saw I went down to 240.

417
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,550
800.

418
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,290
Oh yeah!

419
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,500
The real limit is the servers going down.

420
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,040
I hope people don't come in expecting... they're gonna see me wearing my freak phantom glasses.

421
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,180
Honestly, probably the best...

422
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,160
The best introduction.

423
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,520
Look, I'm level 2!

424
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,760
I'm level 2!

425
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,500
There's people literally level like 3000 here.

426
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,160
Oh gosh.

427
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,780
We even have Yukari Yakumo of Touhou fame.

428
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,180
The freak phantom glasses are the perfect introduction.

429
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,200
I think so too.

430
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,640
You need to be level 3 before you can chat.

431
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,240
Really?

432
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,080
Test.

433
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,560
You're right!

434
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,380
I can't even chat in my own room.

435
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,180
Stop laughing in both chats.

436
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,240
This is so cursed.

437
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,920
Free her mods!

438
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,940
Give me special privileges!

439
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,760
I think we're done though.

440
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,720
What is plus 3?

441
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,200
Does that mean spectators?

442
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,540
I can't chat because I'm not level enough.

443
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,220
That's right.

444
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,380
Even though it's your own chat.

445
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,100
Even though you made your own room.

446
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,700
Okay.

447
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,920
Well, I guess we'll start.

448
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,460
Got it.

449
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,920
Oh, player limit.

450
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,000
Auto start.

451
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,580
Public room.

452
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,200
No, you can't be anonymous and join.

453
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,040
You have to be a...

454
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,280
You have to be someone...

455
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,000
You have to be willing to share your stuff.

456
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,020
We're not hiding likes here.

457
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:41,940
And for the record, I always kept my likes up open.

458
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,660
I always liked what I wanted to.

459
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,480
Despite if people could see it or not.

460
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,540
Wait for 300?

461
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,020
Okay.

462
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,840
We'll wait for 300.

463
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,840
Oh, they're crying.

464
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,650
Even butt wiping?

465
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,870
I don't think I ever liked anything about that.

466
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,030
Did anybody ever even look though?

467
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,410
I never even thought about it.

468
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,310
I never thought that people would look at my likes.

469
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,850
So maybe that's why I just didn't care.

470
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:25,910
We did look?

471
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:26,470
Really?

472
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:26,550
Really?

473
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,380
Let...

474
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,040
Let anons in any way.

475
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,900
There's no real danger.

476
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,040
No, I just wanna...

477
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,380
It's not that it's a danger thing.

478
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,720
I just wanna see people's names.

479
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,360
I wanna know what to call them.

480
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,480
Okie dokie.

481
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,420
Save.

482
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,900
And let's start at 307 players, baby.

483
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,450
I'm scared.

484
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,970
Minto the hero would have kept the likes tab.

485
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,310
Wait, how do I do this again?

486
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:06,750
Ok.

487
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,450
Oh my gosh.

488
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,350
I forgot how much I...

489
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,890
No, not caps lock this.

490
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,490
I forgot how much I like the music in this game.

491
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:16,930
Shoot.

492
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,290
Oh gosh, you guys.

493
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,030
I'm nervous.

494
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:21,970
I'm nervous.

495
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,390
I'm so scared right now.

496
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,570
I'm really nervous right now.

497
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,250
Oh my god.

498
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:29,810
Wow.

499
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,370
It's all like...

500
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,010
It's all coming in.

501
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,810
It's all coming in too fast.

502
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:36,370
Hold on.

503
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:39,030
Don't, don't, don't shoot anything at Minto, please.

504
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:45,030
I haven't played this game in like so many years, ok?

505
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,310
My granny brain's gotta keep up.

506
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,010
My granny...

507
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:49,670
Oh shoot.

508
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,770
Why did I do that even?

509
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,570
Oh shoot.

510
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,370
Screw it.

511
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:52,750
Oh.

512
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:54,990
This one.

513
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:55,970
Boop.

514
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,570
Guys, am I gonna make it?

515
00:26:59,690 --> 00:26:59,790
Oh.

516
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,310
Be honest.

517
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,090
Are we gonna make it, chat?

518
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,310
Chat, are we gonna make it?

519
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,870
Something something chat, is this real?

520
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,090
I don't remember how to teaspoon.

521
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:15,710
I learned maybe, like, once.

522
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:21,450
I learned once, and then... never again did I remember.

523
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,470
Yescent.

524
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,630
Okay.

525
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,050
What rank do you think we'll get?

526
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,230
Oh.

527
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,170
What's that sound?

528
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,050
Sounds like little ants running around.

529
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,690
What is that sound?

530
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,590
Is it my headphones?

531
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,650
What is that sound?

532
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:52,830
Oh my god, I escaped.

533
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,570
Oh, no I did not.

534
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,890
I think we're done, though.

535
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,270
Maybe a little bit.

536
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,770
Oh shoot.

537
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,830
Oh shoot.

538
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,450
Oh shoot.

539
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,710
Oh shoot.

540
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,330
100 players left!

541
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,210
I'm doing it!

542
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:10,730
I'm doing it!

543
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,700
Dressed up!

544
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,400
What did I get?

545
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,540
I don't want to see this.

546
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,480
A virtual ghost!

547
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,900
Oh my god, it's a bloodbath out here.

548
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,020
Can't believe I ranked lower than Min.

549
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,520
Really?

550
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,460
You can't believe that?

551
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,600
Who else is in here?

552
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,600
Who's this?

553
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,240
Patience!

554
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,820
Oh, we can... wait.

555
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,520
How do I see what my rank was?

556
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,940
That's what I'm trying to look for, sorry.

557
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,180
Mint is too pro.

558
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,320
I know.

559
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,560
This person's even... their name is Kill.

560
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,040
They come in with hostile intentions.

561
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,580
They come in with too hostile of intentions.

562
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,060
Get his ass!

563
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,880
Get his ass!

564
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,160
Why piss by?

565
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,500
Why piss by?

566
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,590
Fast Bulba living up to their name.

567
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:09,990
The games, you would think with 300 people, they would go by like really slowly.

568
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,270
But no.

569
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,060
Cheater!

570
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,200
You're cheating!

571
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,740
Oh my god, he's gonna get his ass wiped?

572
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,570
Get wiped.

573
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,840
Oh my gosh, we're already down to two.

574
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,340
Before I can even finish my sentence, great point!

575
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,640
Oh my god, wait.

576
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,520
No way!

577
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,120
I feel like I recognize this name.

578
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,440
I feel like it.

579
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,140
Who else would get 69?

580
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,620
Nice!

581
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,400
With these freaky glasses on.

582
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,000
Wait, who got next to me?

583
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:36,900
Hello.

584
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,200
Don't sniff up.

585
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,840
Get out of here.

586
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,580
Sniff up.

587
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,740
Okay, bye!

588
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,020
Thank you.

589
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,280
Thank you, thank you.

590
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,840
I got the funny number.

591
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,860
That's so silly.

592
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,400
GG Grape.

593
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,160
I don't want to eat grapes anymore.

594
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,340
What are you talking about?

595
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,020
I love grapes!

596
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,440
What is this?

597
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,820
One, one, one.

598
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,040
Oh!

599
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,600
One.

600
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,960
One out of one.

601
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:18,860
Oh.

602
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,420
They won.

603
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,220
Oh.

604
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,660
Bye grape!

605
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,640
See ya.

606
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,420
Alright, let's try again.

607
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:30,800
Ready?

608
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,280
Tang, tang, tang.

609
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,540
Three hundred and twenty eight!

610
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,740
Holy cow!

611
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,020
Guys, this is a chill game, okay?

612
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,260
This is...

613
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,540
This is a chill game.

614
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,900
We're just chilling.

615
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,100
We're vibing, okay?

616
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,420
Just take it easy, everybody.

617
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,380
Take it easy.

618
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,000
Take it...

619
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,560
Take it...

620
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,420
Take it...

621
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:58,540
Oh!

622
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,220
Wait, I forgot.

623
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,620
I thought I had something different.

624
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,220
That's fine.

625
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:01,740
Oh!

626
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,020
There we go.

627
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,260
Oh!

628
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:03,960
Just...

629
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,720
Everybody, chill out.

630
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,620
Let's all just go nice and slow.

631
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,440
Why is the music so epic?

632
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,000
Oh!

633
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,220
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

634
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,820
Whoa, whoa.

635
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:16,880
Oh my god.

636
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,500
They're already...

637
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,940
They're already really coming for my head.

638
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,140
I got sixty-ninth and they're like, you're a threat.

639
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,740
We won't let you get ahead any longer.

640
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,300
That was your highest score today, Minto.

641
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,060
Is what the boss music is saying.

642
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,240
Oh!

643
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,280
I'm scared.

644
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,920
I'm really scared right now.

645
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:41,260
I'm worried about my complexion.

646
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,620
Oh gosh.

647
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:43,700
Oh!

648
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,180
Oh!

649
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,720
There we go.

650
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,440
Okay.

651
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,360
Build flat.

652
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,080
But it's really hard.

653
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,440
Oh!

654
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,640
Oh!

655
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,360
Okay.

656
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,520
Oh!

657
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,760
Flat is just...

658
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,180
Oh!

659
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,120
Oh!

660
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,600
I already messed up.

661
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,460
Oh!

662
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:02,840
Oh!

663
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,220
Oh!

664
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,480
I'm building flat.

665
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,300
Just get it out of here.

666
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,540
I'm building flat.

667
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,480
And nicely.

668
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,640
And evenly.

669
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,080
Look at that.

670
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:18,920
Da da.

671
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,800
Why is this like JoJo ass music?

672
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,700
What's going on?

673
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,220
Oh.

674
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,660
No.

675
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,180
Don't touch me.

676
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:26,820
Oh.

677
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,220
Ah!

678
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,420
Ah yeah.

679
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:27,840
Ah yeah!

680
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:28,780
Oh!

681
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,100
Wait.

682
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:47,700
What?

683
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,080
What's?

684
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:48,360
Oh.

685
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,240
What did I die at, everybody?

686
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,080
What did I die

687
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:00,780
at?

688
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,460
What do you take me for?

689
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,040
102...

690
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,100
This is literal hell!

691
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,940
This is what the final boss music is for!

692
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,200
Look at him!

693
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,860
He's building up his own Ds!

694
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,280
He's making two of them!

695
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,170
I'm literally crying.

696
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,350
WIPE HIS ASS!

697
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,570
He's gonna make it!

698
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,550
He's gonna make it out alive!

699
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,160
Why are you crying?

700
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,580
Because I'm so moved!

701
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:09,960
Wouldn't you be?

702
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,980
I'm so...

703
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,320
We're watching an artist at work!

704
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,700
It's true!

705
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,220
Oh my god, I can't stop crying.

706
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,340
This is peak.

707
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,700
Wait, he died?

708
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,620
Oh my god, wait, when did that happen?

709
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,040
HAHAHAHAHA!

710
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,420
But you were supposed to...

711
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,420
You killed me!

712
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,300
You can't kill me and then not win!

713
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,760
Game!

714
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,460
I made top 100!

715
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:39,780
Unrelated, but in the new Dragon Ball Sparking Zero game, one of the lines Goku says when you go in Super Saiyan is, Kept you waiting, huh?

716
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,320
I saw that!

717
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,260
I did see that.

718
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,920
The new game looks awesome.

719
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:48,880
Thank you!

720
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,160
Thank you!

721
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,300
Chuuu!

722
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,740
Didn't expect Castlevania music in a block.

723
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,840
I got 69?

724
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,040
Really?

725
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,920
I'll be the judge.

726
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,740
Oh, you really did.

727
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,840
But next to baby butt cheeks.

728
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:06,720
HAHAHAHAHA!

729
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,820
My birthday ended days ago, but it's never too late.

730
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,880
Cazaleo!

731
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,060
Happy birthday to you.

732
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,780
Happy birthday to you.

733
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,160
Happy birthday dear Cazaleo.

734
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:32,780
Happy birthday to you.

735
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,040
Happy birthday to you.

736
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,680
Happy birthday.

737
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,780
Wow, who got last?

738
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,180
Oh, I think these people just deseed?

739
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,280
Gummy Crow.

740
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,860
You got last.

741
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:56,920
Okay.

742
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,840
I can chat now, can't I?

743
00:38:59,480 --> 00:38:59,820
Hello.

744
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,140
I'm getting that badge.

745
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,820
Me too.

746
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,040
I'm getting that badge.

747
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:09,980
HAHAHAHAHA!

748
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,760
You're awesome!

749
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,780
Wow, thank you!

750
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,020
New here, playing Tetria with you is so fun.

751
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,980
Work has been slow, so I'm slipping in some games in between.

752
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,040
But I'm enjoying your vibes.

753
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,460
So have a sub and a dono.

754
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:22,960
What?

755
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:23,740
No way!

756
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,560
Thank you!

757
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,400
Thank you so much!

758
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,880
I appreciate it.

759
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,380
Good luck with work!

760
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,800
You can use the controller here?

761
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,100
Oh my gosh, do we have people doing the rolling method?

762
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,840
You know, where they hold it and then they go...

763
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,540
With their fingies?

764
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,220
No way.

765
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,400
Man, man, you're going down.

766
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,220
I'm already down.

767
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,320
Don't put me any further.

768
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,060
Grape is back.

769
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,020
Oh my gosh, I remember this!

770
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,280
Grape is back.

771
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,640
Okay, Grape.

772
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,500
Let's see what you can do.

773
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,840
Can you get...

774
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,720
Wait, so do you get a badge if you just win a game?

775
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,640
Or do you have to win the entire room?

776
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,200
Because...

777
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,060
That'd be crazy.

778
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,320
OSK is in the lobby.

779
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,420
He's the founder...

780
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,540
Of...

781
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,980
Of Tetrio?

782
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,480
Oh no!

783
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,060
What's happening here?

784
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,820
I hear that whenever OSK is in the room with you, crazy things may happen.

785
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,460
Brace yourself.

786
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:45,500
Hi!

787
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,640
Hi!

788
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,140
I'm gonna start now!

789
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,620
I'm scared!

790
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:51,780
I'm scared!

791
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,590
Go!

792
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,070
Faster!

793
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,090
We must be faster!

794
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,110
We must be faster!

795
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,770
This music is killing my vibe, though.

796
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:14,670
This music is killing my vibe!

797
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,990
OSK, I demand you take it out the setlist!

798
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:19,430
Remove it!

799
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,430
If you can hear me!

800
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:27,920
I don't...

801
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,460
I can't...

802
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,000
Oh no!

803
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,380
Oh no!

804
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:29,600
No!

805
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,560
Wait!

806
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:30,820
Wait!

807
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,120
Wait!

808
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,400
No!

809
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,060
I don't mean it!

810
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,480
I didn't mean it!

811
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:33,720
Please!

812
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:34,720
Please!

813
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,100
Please!

814
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:35,300
Please!

815
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:35,840
It's...

816
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:39,920
It's...

817
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,040
It's...

818
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,680
Please!

819
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,480
God, if there is...

820
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,300
I was

821
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,280
gonna say, if there is a John Tetris out there, please...

822
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,100
Let me live!

823
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:07,960
It's okay.

824
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,020
It's okay.

825
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,100
It's okay.

826
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:09,700
It's okay.

827
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,900
Oh, we're back to Grape.

828
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,460
MintSuperfan9000 got KO'd.

829
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,420
Look at them!

830
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,120
They're just dropping like flies!

831
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,620
Grape is taking out everybody!

832
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,120
I died instantly.

833
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,600
It's okay, me too, because I was too busy laughing.

834
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,540
It's the song, everybody.

835
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,740
It's the song.

836
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,360
Insult my soundtrack choice, will you?

837
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:03,210
Streamer laughing is game interference and got me killed.

838
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,510
What are you talking about?

839
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,410
Oh my god, Grape.

840
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,970
You're only ranked...

841
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,130
You're only placement 62-1.

842
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:16,590
Come on.

843
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:17,350
Get better, man.

844
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:17,910
Get better.

845
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:20,070
Oh!

846
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:20,530
Oh!

847
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:20,610
Oh!

848
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:21,750
Oh, good.

849
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,150
Almost three pieces per second.

850
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,210
That's insanity.

851
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,350
Did you mess up?

852
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:33,170
No, I didn't.

853
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:33,810
Of course not.

854
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:38,950
Grape, nah.

855
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:39,490
I'd win.

856
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:41,710
For real.

857
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:43,310
Wait.

858
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:45,830
Oh my god!

859
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:46,630
You can do that?

860
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:48,410
Oh,

861
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:52,470
Minty Fresh!

862
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:53,590
Guy!

863
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,920
Like I said, guys.

864
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,340
I'm not good at Tetris.

865
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,520
But it's all about...

866
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:16,380
It's all about not taking yourself seriously and just having a good time, you know?

867
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,700
Is the...

868
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,100
What's the...

869
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,140
Is the guy in here?

870
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:33,950
Oh, Baby Island!

871
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:47,650
Wow.

872
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,130
They're actually, like, getting better.

873
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:50,870
So, like, the games are longer now.

874
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:52,970
You know?

875
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,170
Usually, it's, like...

876
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:55,350
It was down to, like...

877
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:55,630
Oh!

878
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,910
Were you teasing us?

879
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:00,670
You little tease.

880
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:03,850
Oh!

881
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:04,610
Oh!

882
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:05,470
Oh!

883
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:05,970
Oh!

884
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:06,290
Oh!

885
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,200
Oh!

886
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:11,440
Oh!

887
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,680
It's getting really serious!

888
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:13,260
Oh!

889
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:13,920
It's getting hot!

890
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:14,720
Oh!

891
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,100
Boom!

892
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,440
Tetris for Baby Island!

893
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:17,960
Oh!

894
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:18,440
Ow!

895
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,120
Oh!

896
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:19,980
Oh!

897
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:20,960
Oh!

898
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,180
Oh my god!

899
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:22,560
Oh!

900
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,100
Oh!

901
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:23,580
Boom!

902
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,040
Tetris!

903
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,400
Boom!

904
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:24,540
Oh!

905
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,840
They're so sweaty.

906
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,420
Sushi Man's going crazy.

907
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,060
Everybody here.

908
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,120
Oh!

909
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,180
How's the sound, by the way, guys?

910
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,460
Oh!

911
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,470
What?

912
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,450
I think Baby Island's got him on speed.

913
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:07,230
Yeah.

914
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:08,810
Oh!

915
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:09,270
Maybe?

916
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:09,770
Oh!

917
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:10,490
Oh!

918
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:11,730
On game!

919
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:12,290
Oh!

920
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:12,430
Um...

921
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:15,830
Sound is good?

922
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:16,230
Okay!

923
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:16,710
Thank you.

924
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,190
Okay.

925
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:18,690
Transform now.

926
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:22,090
Okay.

927
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:22,310
Good.

928
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:22,830
Happy birthday!

929
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:26,510
suspent 77af

930
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:34,550
Oh, good.

931
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,070
So they have Yeah.

932
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,930
I locked in the 34th.

933
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:45,510
No way!

934
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:46,750
You're pulling my leg!

935
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:49,690
You're there!

936
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:50,890
Shouse!

937
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,160
289, don't look!

938
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,080
One day we need to make...

939
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,620
Anybody below 100...

940
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:08,600
We need to... You can't join unless you're below 100.

941
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,260
In rank.

942
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,400
Oh man.

943
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,740
If you want I could set the game mode to battle royale under the match tab.

944
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,100
It's a bit more beginner friendly.

945
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,840
Oh thank you!

946
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:30,160
I could set the game mode to battle royale.

947
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,420
Do we want to try that?

948
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,600
I don't mind it being not beginner friendly.

949
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,280
But...

950
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,640
Yeah, you know what?

951
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,960
We do have a big lobby.

952
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,440
So let's try doing that.

953
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:42,320
Yeah.

954
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,820
Thank you always, Kate!

955
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,120
Let me see.

956
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,200
Just in case...

957
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:46,700
Thank you!

958
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,440
Yeah, let's try it.

959
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,380
Aw, so nice!

960
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,400
Don't forget to save.

961
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:54,920
Oh, thank you.

962
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,580
Room configuration updated!

963
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,480
So now it's...

964
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,180
It's...

965
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,020
Like, room v.

966
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:06,600
room, right?

967
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,640
Wait, first to...

968
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,440
Amount of rank...

969
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,820
Wait, how does this work actually?

970
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:14,280
Wait...

971
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,100
Wait...

972
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,200
Where do we drop them?

973
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,960
Do 4 by 100...

974
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,240
No...

975
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,060
Wait...

976
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,480
Just leave it as is?

977
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:30,780
Okay.

978
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:31,600
Let's start it.

979
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,400
Let's see how it goes.

980
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,480
Let's see what happens.

981
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,660
Why is the...

982
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:38,160
Why is the room number keep going up?

983
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:47,570
Oh, this is so cute.

984
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:48,910
See, this is the chill.

985
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,070
You know, everybody.

986
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:52,270
We were talking about.

987
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:53,490
It's...

988
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:55,930
Tetris is no...

989
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:58,590
Big deal, yo, everyone.

990
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,750
Tetris is no big deal, yo.

991
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:05,390
I gotta be fast.

992
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:06,330
I gotta be faster.

993
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:07,510
I gotta be faster.

994
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,350
And I gotta not second guess my...

995
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:11,630
My...

996
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:14,070
Okay, build.

997
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,150
I need to not just take down.

998
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:16,850
I need to build.

999
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,110
Oh, that's fine.

1000
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:18,450
That's fine.

1001
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:19,510
Build, build.

1002
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:21,430
Build, build, build, build.

1003
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,010
Build, build, build.

1004
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,710
Oh, build.

1005
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,050
This looks sad.

1006
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:33,230
Build, build, build.

1007
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:37,050
Build, build, build, build, build, build, build, build, build, build.

1008
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:41,850
Destroy!

1009
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,830
I don't know who I just took out.

1010
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,890
Probably some sad sap.

1011
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:49,930
Didn't even know what was gonna hit him.

1012
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:54,590
But, boom, coming with the made Minto.

1013
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:55,990
Perfect.

1014
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,100
What was that?

1015
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,760
Don't target me.

1016
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,580
I'm the streamer.

1017
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,740
Oh my gosh.

1018
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,260
Don't target me!

1019
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:17,800
I'm the streamer!

1020
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,320
Please!

1021
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:21,680
Oh shoot.

1022
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,460
Oh shoot.

1023
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,320
I'm okay everybody.

1024
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,120
I'm fine.

1025
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:34,180
Maybe.

1026
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,280
Maybe I'm okay.

1027
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,060
Oh my gosh.

1028
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:40,220
This is forcing me to really get good, isn't it?

1029
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,820
Yes sir!

1030
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,880
Yes sir.

1031
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,760
No sir.

1032
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,140
Yes sir.

1033
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,040
Oh no sir!

1034
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:51,820
No sir!

1035
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,320
No sir!

1036
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:52,800
No sir!

1037
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:53,760
No sir!

1038
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:54,160
No sir!

1039
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:54,820
No.

1040
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,300
No sir.

1041
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:01,720
No.

1042
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:02,500
Oh no sir.

1043
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,180
Oh no sir.

1044
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:03,880
No no sir.

1045
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:04,880
Oh shoot!

1046
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,700
Shoot sir!

1047
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:06,340
Shoot sir!

1048
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,740
Oh sir sir.

1049
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,280
Oh I'm sorry sir.

1050
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:09,880
I'm sorry sir.

1051
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:25,310
Oh gosh.

1052
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:28,790
No.

1053
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:29,710
Yes sir.

1054
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,070
I live sir.

1055
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,210
I live sir!

1056
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:36,950
I live sir!

1057
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:37,790
I live sir!

1058
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:42,590
How did I make it out?

1059
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,150
Oh shoot.

1060
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,510
I think I... You guys, I think I've... I think I...

1061
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:50,570
Sad music is really killing me right now.

1062
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,660
I threw for real.

1063
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,900
Top 100 though.

1064
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:09,640
Yippee!

1065
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,780
I'm really sweaty.

1066
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,960
Got to love your freestyle rap.

1067
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,540
That was a rollercoaster of emotions.

1068
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,380
Is Mayoshi PP Island in this?

1069
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:33,760
Old man yaoi.

1070
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:34,600
Oh!

1071
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:35,460
Oh he's came right there!

1072
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,420
I see PP.

1073
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,440
There's Fast Bulba.

1074
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:43,680
Woohoo!

1075
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,340
Woohoo lol.

1076
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:51,860
Funny coincidence I arrived back home from Japan same day of your return stream.

1077
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,620
Sadly no main cafe but I loved being at the Kirby Cafe!

1078
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:55,240
Woo!

1079
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:55,920
Nice!

1080
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,080
How many people were... 367?

1081
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,420
I think?

1082
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,780
Speedy Fire welcome back!

1083
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,020
Ugh.

1084
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,440
The game just gets too fast.

1085
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,280
Yeah.

1086
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,020
Uh oh.

1087
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:23,420
Oh.

1088
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,600
You can fix this.

1089
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:34,720
The way your mood changes playing Tetris is like watching the I'm a Genius Oh No meme on loop.

1090
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:35,860
What's that meme?

1091
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,200
Back to lurking.

1092
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,000
Thank you!

1093
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:51,610
The L-turns are always so... I know, right?

1094
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:53,810
That's the things that I don't expect.

1095
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:55,150
The L-turns.

1096
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:56,730
They're really crazy.

1097
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,070
Can you do that in normal Tetris?

1098
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:00,910
Or like...

1099
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:09,310
Because I've never... I mean, I don't watch so much Tetris stuff but...

1100
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:11,690
Mostly T.

1101
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:12,450
Okay.

1102
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:14,850
You can do it in modern Tetris now.

1103
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:15,270
Wow!

1104
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:22,970
No, I know T-spins.

1105
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,510
L-turns though aren't real.

1106
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:25,070
T-spins.

1107
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:26,590
Okay, I know the T-spins are real.

1108
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:26,830
Yeah.

1109
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,410
In Tetris 99, you can.

1110
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:32,590
In NES Tetris, no.

1111
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,140
T-spins aren't real and can't hurt you.

1112
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,980
Hell no, this isn't me playing.

1113
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,340
I wouldn't be able to talk and play like this.

1114
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:06,920
So delicate.

1115
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,560
Rinto is so good.

1116
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:15,460
Play

1117
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:27,770
like this without talking?

1118
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:30,310
Probably.

1119
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:38,070
I can probably play... I can probably play 50 times better than this guy without talking.

1120
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:41,230
And also off stream.

1121
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:47,050
I can play 50 times better than this guy off stream.

1122
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:52,290
Streamer debuff.

1123
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:52,670
Yeah.

1124
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:55,070
I get... I get a little bit of anxiety.

1125
00:55:56,670 --> 00:56:03,450
The... you know, you guys watching just really makes me anxious and nervous and sweaty.

1126
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:09,670
If she wasn't streaming, she'd be number one Tetris.

1127
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:09,790
That's true.

1128
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:11,210
That's true.

1129
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:15,250
Pikachu, welcome to membership.

1130
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:15,850
Thank you.

1131
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:18,770
10 people left.

1132
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:26,130
Oh, Pee Pee Island.

1133
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:28,750
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Pee Pee Island.

1134
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:28,990
Oh.

1135
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:29,590
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Pee Pee Island.

1136
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:30,570
Oh.

1137
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:33,410
Oh.

1138
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:33,530
Oh.

1139
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:48,270
Oh.

1140
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:50,810
Oh.

1141
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:53,330
Oh.

1142
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,340
They're throwing on purpose because you told them to?

1143
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,120
What!

1144
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,160
He fought himself!

1145
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,160
I leveled up.

1146
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,040
I want to say that you're awesome.

1147
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,300
Thank you, Magister!

1148
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,080
I got 88th, though.

1149
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,400
Actually, that's not so bad.

1150
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,180
I thought I was just top 100, but I got 88th.

1151
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,240
I mean, I am top 100, but like...

1152
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,320
Nice!

1153
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,220
I'll take it.

1154
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,880
Especially because I got taken down by the frickin' winner!

1155
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,560
You frickin' fricksa!

1156
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:59,540
At 300+, that's good.

1157
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:00,100
Yeah!

1158
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,180
It's not bad, right?

1159
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,160
Yippee!

1160
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,380
I don't understand this game mode, though.

1161
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,440
I don't really understand it.

1162
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,180
There was some desync.

1163
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,360
FigJam!

1164
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,600
Thanks for the five gifted!

1165
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:20,080
Thank you!

1166
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,920
I didn't K-O-O-S-K.

1167
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:30,980
So sad.

1168
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,380
Seems like Tetris 99, maybe.

1169
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:41,100
Well, basically works the same as Tetris 99, but without the garbage cap.

1170
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,620
Ah, okay, okay.

1171
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,480
Well, cool!

1172
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:46,580
Oh my gosh, we're almost to 400 people in here!

1173
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:47,740
This is wild!

1174
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:48,700
Cosmic down!

1175
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,960
Thanks for the five gifted!

1176
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:51,340
Holy cow!

1177
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:52,600
Alright.

1178
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,140
Message... about... now.

1179
00:58:58,460 --> 00:58:58,800
Huh?

1180
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,320
About who, huh?

1181
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:04,240
What, what?

1182
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,200
About now.

1183
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,460
Hello?

1184
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:14,900
Hahahaha!

1185
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,880
Hahahaha!

1186
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,500
Hahahaha!

1187
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:28,750
Huh?

1188
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:30,630
Okay, anyway.

1189
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:33,870
Okay, let's start the game!

1190
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,140
378!

1191
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,320
Holy moly.

1192
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,650
I died!

1193
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:45,670
Beep!

1194
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:46,310
Beep!

1195
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:47,410
Beep!

1196
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:47,690
Wah!

1197
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:50,740
Ooh!

1198
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,260
Mysterious!

1199
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:56,720
Mysterious...

1200
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,280
I could do a T-spin right there.

1201
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,540
Okay, I have to handle myself appropriately.

1202
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,140
Hold on!

1203
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,120
I'm setting up!

1204
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:08,500
Gosh!

1205
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:09,520
Wait.

1206
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,600
Oh, I messed it up.

1207
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:12,840
Never mind!

1208
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:13,620
Hold on, please!

1209
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:14,560
Please!

1210
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:15,380
No!

1211
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:15,880
Please!

1212
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:16,520
God!

1213
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,260
Let me fix this!

1214
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:18,680
Okay!

1215
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:19,400
Hold on!

1216
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,160
I just wanted to...

1217
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,140
I wanted to be like the cool kids, man!

1218
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,180
This is torture!

1219
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:27,700
Oh, okay.

1220
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:28,680
Oh, no!

1221
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:32,570
Like this?

1222
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:35,090
Ah, I think I'm in trouble.

1223
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,970
Guys, I think I'm in trouble.

1224
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,610
I think I'm in trouble.

1225
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:40,250
I didn't even get to play!

1226
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:50,300
I tried.

1227
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,640
I tried.

1228
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:04,960
There was an attempt.

1229
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,460
Lying too close to the sun on that one.

1230
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,360
Maybe this isn't the best place to...

1231
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:13,700
To, you know... practice.

1232
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:15,580
Hahaha!

1233
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:29,870
Maybe Battle Royale isn't better for noobs.

1234
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,390
OSK really...

1235
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:36,490
Just totally overestimated my skill level.

1236
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:41,650
It's okay, though.

1237
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:44,470
This is how you get better.

1238
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:46,250
By playing against the real good people.

1239
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:47,830
It's true, though.

1240
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:49,550
But it's my fault.

1241
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:50,810
I haven't played in literal years.

1242
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:51,610
So...

1243
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:55,050
It's all my fault.

1244
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:57,090
Who else is in here?

1245
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:58,790
Oh!

1246
01:01:59,110 --> 01:01:59,610
Oh!

1247
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,250
You got disturbed!

1248
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:06,110
How do you even see with those shades?

1249
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:07,390
I'm telling you.

1250
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:08,850
With my instincts.

1251
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,630
They're not very sharp, though.

1252
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:14,630
Fun for Tetris FX connected on Steam.

1253
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:15,890
Oh!

1254
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,450
Tetris FX...

1255
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:26,430
Is that the one, the really chill one that takes you through time and space?

1256
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:27,750
No, that's...

1257
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:28,310
Wait.

1258
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:30,350
No, that is the Tetris FX, isn't it?

1259
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:33,990
Isn't that Tetris FX?

1260
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1261
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:42,180
But

1262
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,560
for Puyo Puyo Tetris...

1263
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,940
I am so garbage at Puyo Puyo, though.

1264
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:04,560
If you want to see even more pain than this today...

1265
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:11,270
You can play Tetris FX, that movie with...

1266
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:12,950
Ashton Kutcher?

1267
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:16,390
You can play Tetris FX in VR!

1268
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:22,790
I remember, like, you go through the ocean and there's like...

1269
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:24,030
Space...

1270
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:25,530
Space...

1271
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:26,470
What's the word?

1272
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,310
Space Whales.

1273
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,970
I like Tetris with Cardcaptor, Sakura...

1274
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:39,970
Fix it!

1275
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:40,890
It's a super!

1276
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:41,430
Akasupa!

1277
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:45,830
Gives me such a throwback to be able to play with you in chat since...

1278
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:48,210
Since last time, many years ago.

1279
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:51,170
Here's my first Akasupa since I wasn't able back then.

1280
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:52,750
Thank you!

1281
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:55,210
I really appreciate it.

1282
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:57,390
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1283
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:02,190
I know, it is a bit of a throwback though, isn't it?

1284
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:07,030
Not even a bit of a throwback.

1285
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:08,430
Like, a lot of a throwback.

1286
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:12,250
Is Minta Pro at Honey Pop?

1287
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,810
Oh yeah.

1288
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:16,730
Don't you know it.

1289
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:17,430
Dang!

1290
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:19,390
Dave is really holding his own up in here.

1291
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:21,650
I saw you play detective games.

1292
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:25,250
I think you'd like Tangle Tower on Steam.

1293
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:26,190
It's a murder mystery.

1294
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:28,810
Thanks for the...

1295
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:30,330
For the suggestion.

1296
01:04:57,390 --> 01:04:58,810
That wasn't your fault.

1297
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:02,390
I've never felt so inadequate as a gamer.

1298
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:07,230
Honey Pop's dream win.

1299
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:11,370
When I decide that I no longer need this channel, I guess.

1300
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:14,310
I think YouTube would ban me, wouldn't they?

1301
01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:16,050
Even I...

1302
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:18,370
There's like a save for work version though, isn't there?

1303
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:20,210
But I still think that I would...

1304
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:23,610
I think like even on Twitch, even if you play the save for work one...

1305
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:30,870
You can play a patch on YouTube?

1306
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:31,650
No way.

1307
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:32,930
Really?

1308
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:33,010
Really?

1309
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:47,190
Sushi Man is still in it.

1310
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:48,910
Remilia!

1311
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:52,070
That's my Oshii right there.

1312
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:54,990
Wait.

1313
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:55,530
Remilia?

1314
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:56,690
Remilia?

1315
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:58,550
Remilia?

1316
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:01,330
Remilia, where'd you go?

1317
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:09,230
Yeah, these people are crazy good.

1318
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,080
Sushi Man said, nope.

1319
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:33,910
And then the game said, nope.

1320
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:35,130
Back at him.

1321
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:37,210
Dang.

1322
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:39,810
That was such a good comeback though at first.

1323
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:42,850
How is this still humanly possible?

1324
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:49,770
You get a badge if you KO OSK in any game.

1325
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:51,830
So his presence is probably luring players.

1326
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:56,350
I did know about the badge, but I guess you're right.

1327
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:59,230
That maybe people are like, uh-huh, I want the badge.

1328
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:02,770
Oh my gosh, Minto Room's so popular!

1329
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:04,450
It's a party up in here, baby!

1330
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:06,190
I mean, it's a...

1331
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:07,070
It's like a...

1332
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:09,330
I mean, it's a battle royale party.

1333
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:11,050
It's a bloodbath up in here.

1334
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:13,550
Soap party!

1335
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:15,430
With bath!

1336
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:16,830
I mean, with blood!

1337
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:19,970
Whoa!

1338
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:23,190
Committed to membership.

1339
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:25,150
Thanks for inventing, Tetris.

1340
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:27,850
Thanks, PaperBuzz!

1341
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:29,290
Oh!

1342
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:29,550
Oh!

1343
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:29,870
Oh!

1344
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:30,770
281.

1345
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:32,890
That was my mess up though.

1346
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:33,550
It really was.

1347
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:36,390
That was my mess up.

1348
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:39,170
Goth Girl Slayer!

1349
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:41,450
But she couldn't slay.

1350
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:43,970
I think...

1351
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:48,270
Couldn't slay in Tetrio.

1352
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:49,110
So sad.

1353
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:54,550
GG, everybody.

1354
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:56,330
GG, everybody.

1355
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:03,970
Practically a more beginner-friendly game mode, but when you have a bunch of people from the highest ranks in the lobby, beginner-friendly is relative.

1356
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:05,750
Yeah, makes sense.

1357
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:07,370
No, I'm still having fun though.

1358
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:10,650
I don't really care if really good people come in.

1359
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:15,510
Just survived the worst exam of my life and I want to celebrate!

1360
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:16,050
Let's go!

1361
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:18,730
Your ghost trick streams gave me life.

1362
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:19,630
I'm so happy!

1363
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:22,090
Congrats on finishing your exam!

1364
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:24,890
Okay.

1365
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:27,510
I got 22nd.

1366
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:29,310
I saw you up in there, Amelia!

1367
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:30,490
I totally saw you.

1368
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:31,090
I was like, yo!

1369
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:33,590
I got 49th.

1370
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:34,890
It's fun to play Tetris with you again.

1371
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:35,290
Yeah!

1372
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:38,070
Alright.

1373
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:41,450
It was huge fun.

1374
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:42,750
Thank you!

1375
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:44,690
Thanks.

1376
01:08:47,070 --> 01:08:48,930
I think people are leaving.

1377
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:50,750
Maybe because OSK left.

1378
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:52,410
Go you!

1379
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:58,070
Pinning message is just slash A.

1380
01:08:58,650 --> 01:08:59,250
Message.

1381
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:05,050
I am mint.

1382
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:07,630
Wow!

1383
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:09,870
Oh, cool!

1384
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:13,630
That's what I wrote.

1385
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:14,530
I'm mint.

1386
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:16,810
I'm almost sweating.

1387
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:18,130
I am sweating.

1388
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:19,450
I am sweating.

1389
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:20,030
I am sweating.

1390
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:21,370
I am sweating.

1391
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:23,470
I am sweating.

1392
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:24,930
Messing around with the game presets.

1393
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:25,770
I think I...

1394
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:28,670
I think things are pretty interesting in of itself.

1395
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:30,930
Especially with my level, you know?

1396
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:36,390
Sorry for misleading you.

1397
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:37,010
New Godzilla.

1398
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:37,890
Minus one.

1399
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:39,490
It's not only on Netflix.

1400
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:41,670
Also on all streaming services.

1401
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:41,950
Oh!

1402
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:42,550
Let's go!

1403
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:44,270
Now I can finally watch it.

1404
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:45,610
Okie dokie!

1405
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:47,090
Let's start the game.

1406
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:53,660
I'm guessing...

1407
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:55,580
Do lobbies not get this very...

1408
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:57,040
This big very often?

1409
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:58,660
It's probably...

1410
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:00,560
It's probably exciting for even the bigger players too.

1411
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,540
Because they get to play with a lot of different people.

1412
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,660
Just a lot of people in general, you know?

1413
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:05,500
So...

1414
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:05,880
You know.

1415
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:08,480
It's fun for everybody.

1416
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:09,640
I'd say.

1417
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,160
It's just a big old party room.

1418
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:14,140
Whoa!

1419
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:16,220
Oh!

1420
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:16,340
No!

1421
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:16,540
No!

1422
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:16,780
Please!

1423
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:16,960
No!

1424
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:17,260
God!

1425
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:17,520
Please!

1426
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:17,660
No!

1427
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,080
Please!

1428
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:18,380
Please!

1429
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:18,580
God!

1430
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:18,980
Please!

1431
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:19,260
No!

1432
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:19,680
Please!

1433
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:20,740
I'm too slow at this!

1434
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:21,280
Ah!

1435
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:22,580
Ah!

1436
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:24,560
Please!

1437
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:25,840
Please God!

1438
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,400
Please Tetris God!

1439
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,040
John Tetris!

1440
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:29,840
John Tetris!

1441
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:30,700
Ah!

1442
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:37,310
There's no way I can recover from...

1443
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:38,370
Oh!

1444
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:39,650
Oh!

1445
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:40,590
Oh!

1446
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:41,250
Oh!

1447
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:41,670
Oh!

1448
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:41,830
Oh!

1449
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:44,470
I killed someone!

1450
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:46,570
Sorry.

1451
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:49,390
I...

1452
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:49,950
Hi!

1453
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:50,630
Me!

1454
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:51,370
Oh!

1455
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:51,670
Oh!

1456
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:53,690
I KO'd somebody!

1457
01:10:56,130 --> 01:10:56,570
I'm...

1458
01:10:56,570 --> 01:10:57,470
I'm a monster!

1459
01:10:57,790 --> 01:10:58,930
I'm a monster now!

1460
01:10:59,050 --> 01:10:59,210
Oh no!

1461
01:10:59,290 --> 01:10:59,330
No!

1462
01:10:59,370 --> 01:10:59,490
Please!

1463
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:00,070
That doesn't...

1464
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:01,710
That doesn't make me a target!

1465
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:02,010
Please!

1466
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:03,210
That doesn't make me a target!

1467
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:03,590
Please!

1468
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:04,490
Please God!

1469
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:04,810
No!

1470
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:06,050
No!

1471
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:06,410
No!

1472
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:06,650
No!

1473
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:06,910
No!

1474
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:07,130
No!

1475
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:13,430
Please!

1476
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:14,010
Please!

1477
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:15,310
Oh!

1478
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:15,530
No!

1479
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:16,390
I'm throwing!

1480
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:17,690
I'm throwing!

1481
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:18,890
I'm throwing for real!

1482
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,410
The pressure is too strong!

1483
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:21,410
I'm...

1484
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:22,110
I'm too...

1485
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:23,690
I'm too good at the game now!

1486
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:37,610
Karma for killing so many!

1487
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,580
Monster Minto!

1488
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:47,200
Dude came back at all I did!

1489
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,200
How does the blood taste, man?

1490
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,200
Delicious!

1491
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,760
You can now call me vamp.

1492
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,860
Not because I'm a vampire.

1493
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:06,260
How can you miss twice, Minto?

1494
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:07,720
I'm telling you!

1495
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,960
The pressure is too great!

1496
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,760
I can't live with myself...

1497
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,680
Well, I'm not living at all, but...

1498
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:16,400
I can't...

1499
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:20,380
I can't take this pressure of knowing that the creator of the website is watching me.

1500
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,160
Potentially.

1501
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:28,210
Oh, my goodness gracious.

1502
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:32,670
Remilia!

1503
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:34,930
I believe in you.

1504
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:36,130
I believe in you.

1505
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:37,510
That's my toho oshi right there.

1506
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:39,790
Grape slu...

1507
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:40,550
Grape is back!

1508
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:41,290
Oh, no.

1509
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,780
I'm not jinxing Remilia.

1510
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:04,110
These guys are so fast, I know, right?

1511
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:05,310
They're crazy good.

1512
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:08,850
I'm gonna be there one day.

1513
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:11,710
Thanks, Mid, for KO'ing me.

1514
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:12,530
I'm going to cry!

1515
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:20,230
You're welcome Sir9!

1516
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:20,950
You're welcome Sir9!

1517
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:21,330
Sir9!

1518
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:21,370
Sir9!

1519
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:21,830
Sir9!

1520
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:22,410
Sir9!

1521
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:22,450
Sir9!

1522
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:22,470
Sir9!

1523
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:24,250
I bet it was your honor.

1524
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:26,350
Your pleasure.

1525
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,720
Remy's theme is playing in my head right now.

1526
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,600
With the Castlevania music, it's kind of perfect.

1527
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:01,800
Love the certified freak phantom glasses.

1528
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:03,000
Thank you!

1529
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,260
Is this real?

1530
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,460
Chat, is this real?

1531
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,000
When playing Tetris, the goal isn't to win.

1532
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,160
The goal is to be eliminated by me.

1533
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,740
I think that will probably be my only elimination today.

1534
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:24,360
I'm sorry to say.

1535
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,020
They caused a natural...

1536
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,880
They caused nature to respond to the thunder!

1537
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,900
They had 23 combo!

1538
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:51,870
Have you ever played any of the Castlevania games before?

1539
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:52,250
I have!

1540
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:53,870
I like them.

1541
01:14:59,360 --> 01:14:59,840
Hippie!

1542
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:00,660
Welcome to membership.

1543
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:01,220
Thank you!

1544
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:07,540
Zeus!

1545
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:08,420
Zeus Caboose!

1546
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,980
Come on, Zeus Caboose!

1547
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:17,820
The games are getting longer and longer.

1548
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,380
Now we're stuck at 40 people.

1549
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:21,940
The Zeus is loose!

1550
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,180
30 combo caused the thunder!

1551
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,660
Have you seen the old Metal Gear Solid Flash video called Crab Battle?

1552
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:38,420
I have!

1553
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:42,360
When I was playing MGS3...

1554
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:47,080
A bunch of people kept recommending it to me.

1555
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,960
The Zeus got Caboosed!

1556
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:53,060
Lore!

1557
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:53,940
Welcome to membership!

1558
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:54,300
Thank you!

1559
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,360
Tetris with my Oshi is scary but fun this time.

1560
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:02,660
It used to still... you know, it used to be pretty intense back in the day too.

1561
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:06,360
But I think... I think we've reached new levels.

1562
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:10,120
I think not only have people reached new heights...

1563
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:18,040
But so have the lobbies.

1564
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:23,160
I was practicing most of today in preparation for this stream.

1565
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:25,780
And you did really well.

1566
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:26,880
You've been doing really well.

1567
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:43,120
They're dancing?

1568
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:50,440
My bad for KOing you this round before this one.

1569
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,040
Oh, the round before this one.

1570
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,020
No worries, Lore!

1571
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:55,840
No worries.

1572
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:56,620
It's all in the game.

1573
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,000
Holy cow!

1574
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,900
Sushi Man took them out!

1575
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:08,600
The sushi is raw!

1576
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:10,160
Fresh from the sea!

1577
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,820
Hey boss, just quit my job.

1578
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,400
By cussing at my boss earlier.

1579
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:19,960
Problem is, I don't have much money.

1580
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:21,620
Should I come back and pretend like nothing happened?

1581
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:22,680
Yeah!

1582
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,760
I'm sure he'll just say it was a dream.

1583
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,540
Also, you could go up to him and be like, chat, is this real?

1584
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,460
And he'll say no.

1585
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,040
It's real.

1586
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:37,880
There's hope to the most cracked on PC.

1587
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,340
I'm just gaslighting.

1588
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:44,180
Say it never happened.

1589
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,440
This person has no life and no game.

1590
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,960
I talk so much shit for someone that can't...

1591
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:01,420
I can't hold

1592
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:05,330
my own.

1593
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:14,370
I don't think Sushi Man has won a game yet.

1594
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:16,190
Aw...

1595
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:18,810
G-Z-I!

1596
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:21,890
Oh my goodness.

1597
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:25,510
That was so close.

1598
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:27,630
I leveled up to level 7.

1599
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:31,870
What was I?

1600
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:32,390
215?

1601
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:35,710
There I am.

1602
01:18:53,950 --> 01:18:55,910
Rest in peace, Sushi Man.

1603
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:56,490
Yeah.

1604
01:18:57,770 --> 01:18:58,370
Sheesh.

1605
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:01,490
I got 35 on that one.

1606
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:02,010
Nice!

1607
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:07,790
And Draco6 for the tag gifted!

1608
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:13,210
I achieved my mission of pushing Mint's ranking up by one.

1609
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:13,890
Stop.

1610
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:14,850
No.

1611
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:15,130
No.

1612
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:15,730
No.

1613
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:16,850
Alright.

1614
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:23,130
Thanks, John Ronaldo!

1615
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:28,890
Mint will win this one for sure.

1616
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:29,370
Yeah!

1617
01:19:30,690 --> 01:19:31,330
I'm...

1618
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:33,910
I'm using tilt controls!

1619
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:39,010
I even pinned my message.

1620
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:45,250
I'm using tilt controls!

1621
01:19:46,150 --> 01:19:50,230
Okay, the lobby's going down just a little bit, so maybe this is our chance, you guys.

1622
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:55,450
350 players!

1623
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:04,400
What days will you be attending Anime Fest?

1624
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,420
I think, like, every single day.

1625
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:10,000
Not even lying.

1626
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,260
They were like, can you attend, like, every day?

1627
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:14,460
And I was like, um...

1628
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,320
That's a lot of days.

1629
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:18,720
Hey, hey.

1630
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,140
Hey, we just started.

1631
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,140
Not cool, not cool.

1632
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:23,640
Not cool, not cool.

1633
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:24,560
Not cool.

1634
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:25,700
We just started.

1635
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:26,900
Hey, hey, not cool.

1636
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:29,080
Not cool, not cool.

1637
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:30,940
Get out of here.

1638
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:36,950
I'm holding my own.

1639
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:40,010
This is a doggy dog.

1640
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:42,010
No world out here, please!

1641
01:20:42,670 --> 01:20:43,270
Please!

1642
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:43,890
Please!

1643
01:20:44,930 --> 01:20:45,530
Gosh,

1644
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:49,400
please!

1645
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,620
Oh gosh, it's such a doggy dog world!

1646
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:56,220
No!

1647
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:10,070
This is murder.

1648
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:12,570
This is a murder!

1649
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:14,070
Oh my gosh, hey guys!

1650
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:17,690
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

1651
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:18,270
Holy cow!

1652
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:19,690
Thank you!

1653
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:23,690
I'm gonna go get some more water real quick, though, guys.

1654
01:21:23,730 --> 01:21:24,230
I'll be right back.

1655
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:26,510
I will be...

1656
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:28,630
BRB.

1657
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:29,990
BRB.

1658
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:32,790
You guys can watch, uh, Nesulu.

1659
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:35,450
It's a doggy dog world out there.

1660
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:38,470
I pray you survive the exorcisms to come be well.

1661
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:40,570
Thank you for the peek.

1662
01:21:41,290 --> 01:21:42,170
Thank you.

1663
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:43,570
I'll be right back.

1664
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:44,110
I'll be right back.

1665
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:52,290
I'm 100% getting worse each round.

1666
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:52,970
No, it's not you!

1667
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:54,130
I think people are getting better!

1668
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:56,830
All the better people are coming into the lobby, for real.

1669
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:11,760
I also bought a slice of pizza.

1670
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:14,600
It's cold.

1671
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:34,410
Gyro now goes here!

1672
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:35,170
Hello!

1673
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:39,090
Blue super chat.

1674
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:50,310
I discovered you with that drill.

1675
01:23:57,660 --> 01:23:58,800
Why are you so good at this?

1676
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,320
I'm just a really talented...

1677
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,680
Look, Ma!

1678
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:04,300
No hands!

1679
01:24:09,530 --> 01:24:11,310
There's a doggy dog world out here.

1680
01:24:11,370 --> 01:24:12,730
That's what this song should be called.

1681
01:24:12,850 --> 01:24:13,770
Doggy dog world.

1682
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:18,530
Doesn't it have some super doggy dog vibes?

1683
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:28,160
Professional observer.

1684
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,580
Sign me up for GDQ.

1685
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:33,680
I'll observe all your games.

1686
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,480
I feel more like a cool cat listening to this.

1687
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:44,360
You're so right.

1688
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:54,970
Sorry, I'll react more.

1689
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:57,050
Once I've done my pizza.

1690
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:16,230
How often does the guy play Tetris for people to get so excited to try and get the badge?

1691
01:25:16,890 --> 01:25:19,010
I imagine he's also so good, you know?

1692
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:22,190
Mint

1693
01:25:25,770 --> 01:25:26,710
won't read this.

1694
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:36,740
Dill pickle and chicken on white sauce is the best pizza.

1695
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:38,200
Awesome!

1696
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,940
Oh, he rarely joins public rooms.

1697
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:43,460
The

1698
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:54,370
exam's starting next week.

1699
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:54,630
No!

1700
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:57,130
You got this!

1701
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:03,890
White bear butts!

1702
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:15,250
Chicken and white sauce.

1703
01:26:17,430 --> 01:26:19,870
Sounds like you made like a weird chicken alfredo.

1704
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:28,890
I ran a game at AGDQ 2020.

1705
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:30,170
What'd you run?

1706
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:34,090
What one?

1707
01:26:36,610 --> 01:26:38,270
I guess I would kinda dox you though.

1708
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:43,050
Freaking rad looking phantom right there.

1709
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:45,230
Can

1710
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:01,700
you think of a pizza?

1711
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:03,300
I don't know if you can get out of that one, buddy.

1712
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:04,520
A pizza?

1713
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:05,700
It's just a cheese pizza.

1714
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:06,360
That's it.

1715
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:15,040
I ran Battletoads Game Boy on Super Game Boy?

1716
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:21,200
I thought Battletoads wasn't a real game.

1717
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:23,240
A

1718
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:35,520
little messy there, Tiana.

1719
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:37,760
Oh, you got this though.

1720
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,060
I have no room to talk.

1721
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:41,540
What the hell am I trying to get commentary for?

1722
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:43,680
It's real?

1723
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:46,840
I'll call GameStop and check if it's real.

1724
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:50,440
It's actually real?

1725
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:51,320
No way.

1726
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:04,730
I was screwed over by the new lagless monitors they wanted.

1727
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:05,190
Oh.

1728
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:09,410
I didn't want to make it difficult for them to set up a CRT.

1729
01:28:09,610 --> 01:28:09,690
Ah.

1730
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:11,470
This will get interesting.

1731
01:28:12,150 --> 01:28:14,190
It's not for like the record though.

1732
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:15,350
It's for the charity.

1733
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:23,760
Joy, thank you for the pink.

1734
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:24,760
Thank you so much.

1735
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,700
The Kingdom Hearts PC release is real.

1736
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:30,440
You're right.

1737
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:31,480
Cookie!

1738
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,760
I don't think blood can get out of this one.

1739
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:39,160
Ooh.

1740
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,480
Yeah, you're right.

1741
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:47,720
Kingdom Hearts is on Steam now.

1742
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:48,340
That's crazy.

1743
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:57,080
830 lines sent.

1744
01:28:57,300 --> 01:29:02,240
A flood sent over a thou- This person sent 1,200 lines!

1745
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:03,320
1,500 lines!

1746
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,700
Sushi Man is really fast.

1747
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,080
Like, stinking fast.

1748
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,740
Would I ever stream Kingdom Hearts?

1749
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:18,460
Probably not.

1750
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,900
If I were to stream Kingdom Hearts...

1751
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,940
I honestly only have any interest in the first two games.

1752
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:29,660
So...

1753
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:32,500
I don't think I would stream them, to be honest.

1754
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:37,220
Good morning.

1755
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:38,120
Good morning!

1756
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:42,320
GG Mint.

1757
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:46,160
Uh, yeah.

1758
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,180
G-G-G-G-G.

1759
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:49,800
Yeah.

1760
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:50,640
GG.

1761
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,120
Kingdom Hearts 2 is the best Kingdom Hearts for sure.

1762
01:29:58,300 --> 01:29:58,840
I agree.

1763
01:29:59,060 --> 01:29:59,820
It's my favorite.

1764
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:02,920
I remember!

1765
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:05,480
I remember!

1766
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:08,340
Like...

1767
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,120
Killing off Sephiroth.

1768
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:16,560
Like, trying that fight over and over and over again.

1769
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:18,980
Until I finally beat him.

1770
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:23,420
Yeah...

1771
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:23,800
Okay.

1772
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,340
How is everyone so fast?

1773
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:27,120
Um...

1774
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,300
Go... wait.

1775
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:29,060
Slime?

1776
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,960
Go easy on me.

1777
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:32,820
Please-y.

1778
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:36,060
Go easy on me, please-y!

1779
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,120
Hahahaha!

1780
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:42,040
Here we go!

1781
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:43,880
No.

1782
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,460
Easy, please-y!

1783
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:51,300
Oh, look!

1784
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:51,980
We're losing people!

1785
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:52,620
Thank goodness.

1786
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:55,940
I mean...

1787
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:56,460
Oh, no!

1788
01:30:58,140 --> 01:30:59,060
Oh, no!

1789
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:00,340
My room is less popular!

1790
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:01,820
Oh, no!

1791
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:06,640
Oh, this is so nice.

1792
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:08,680
This is so nice.

1793
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:13,840
When are they dropping the Tetrio soundtrack, huh?

1794
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:16,580
This is so awesome.

1795
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:17,560
Oh.

1796
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:18,520
Oh.

1797
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:19,300
Hey!

1798
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:20,220
Whoa!

1799
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:21,600
Why is it already so full?

1800
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:22,380
Uh-oh.

1801
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:22,960
Oh, shoot.

1802
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:23,820
I messed up.

1803
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:24,620
Oh.

1804
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:25,320
I messed up.

1805
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:25,700
There we go.

1806
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:26,280
Ah!

1807
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:27,860
Come on, man!

1808
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:30,160
Oh.

1809
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,100
Oh, gosh.

1810
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:31,580
Oh, gosh.

1811
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:31,640
Oh, gosh.

1812
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:31,660
Oh, gosh.

1813
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:31,780
Oh, gosh.

1814
01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:33,780
I gotta go faster.

1815
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:34,860
I gotta go...

1816
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:35,420
Maybe...

1817
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:36,020
Maybe...

1818
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:40,660
Maybe we should let the good people have their own room, right?

1819
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:41,820
Oh, shoot.

1820
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:43,220
Okay.

1821
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:44,080
Okay.

1822
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:45,800
Get me out of here, please!

1823
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:46,660
Oh, gosh!

1824
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:50,480
Oh.

1825
01:31:55,570 --> 01:31:56,290
I just...

1826
01:31:56,290 --> 01:31:56,570
Oh.

1827
01:31:56,670 --> 01:31:57,230
Okay.

1828
01:31:57,370 --> 01:31:58,310
And, uh...

1829
01:31:58,310 --> 01:31:58,730
My

1830
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:12,580
emplacement's all over the place, everybody!

1831
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:15,860
I think they left me alone.

1832
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:17,120
Let's go.

1833
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:17,840
Ah!

1834
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:18,300
Ah!

1835
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:22,060
No, please.

1836
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:23,500
Please!

1837
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:30,060
Ow!

1838
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:55,380
You know what?

1839
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:56,520
I'm gonna go into Zen mode.

1840
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,500
I'm practicing, you guys.

1841
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:02,120
I'm getting...

1842
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:02,960
I gotta get faster.

1843
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:03,720
Okay.

1844
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:04,440
Oh.

1845
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:05,640
Practice speed.

1846
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,940
Practice speed and placement.

1847
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:09,620
Actually, it doesn't matter where you place.

1848
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:11,040
It kinda matters where you place.

1849
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:13,660
But it doesn't matter as long as you're fast about it.

1850
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:15,040
You can get yourself out of anything.

1851
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,480
As long as you're fast about it...

1852
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:19,340
Why is the music so funky?

1853
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:23,680
Oh, I almost said monkey because I was saying music and funky, but now I'm thinking about balloons!

1854
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,520
What was I saying?

1855
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:30,300
It doesn't matter.

1856
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,480
It doesn't... faster.

1857
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:35,360
Faster.

1858
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:38,220
Faster, faster.

1859
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:40,520
Faster.

1860
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:42,820
See, I can get myself out of that.

1861
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:43,700
Easy peasy.

1862
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:44,580
No worries.

1863
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:45,600
Just gotta be fast.

1864
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,500
See, look at that.

1865
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:48,920
Yeah!

1866
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:51,380
Look at that!

1867
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:53,480
See?

1868
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:57,960
It doesn't matter how bad you are, as long as you're fast about it.

1869
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:02,840
It's okay.

1870
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:04,780
Everybody makes mistakes.

1871
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:06,760
Everybody has those days.

1872
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:10,100
There we go.

1873
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:12,080
Just slide that right in there.

1874
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:12,800
Little pickle.

1875
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,460
Everybody has these days.

1876
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:18,100
Oh, I made another mistake.

1877
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:19,820
Everybody makes mistakes.

1878
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:22,200
Everybody has these days.

1879
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:23,100
Maybe it does matter.

1880
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:27,280
Maybe I was... maybe I had full-on colpium.

1881
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:28,960
No.

1882
01:34:34,190 --> 01:34:35,510
Be bad quickly.

1883
01:34:35,730 --> 01:34:36,590
Get guided, boss.

1884
01:34:47,950 --> 01:34:50,770
Sounds like straight-up visual novel music.

1885
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:53,590
Oh.

1886
01:34:53,650 --> 01:34:54,310
It's okay.

1887
01:34:58,170 --> 01:34:59,510
I'm in a visual novel now.

1888
01:35:02,350 --> 01:35:04,670
And it's... somebody will die.

1889
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:06,990
It probably was me.

1890
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:08,170
I'm already dead.

1891
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:16,140
This is it.

1892
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:18,000
This is my... this is my popular era.

1893
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:19,940
This is my sexy arc!

1894
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,600
Oh, no.

1895
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:23,060
I died.

1896
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:28,300
The music is so sad.

1897
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:32,540
Oh, no.

1898
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:35,920
Oh.

1899
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:37,220
That's okay.

1900
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,000
The

1901
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:49,600
ladies love me!

1902
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:52,700
I think.

1903
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:55,720
Uh-oh.

1904
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:58,940
How am I going to get myself out of this pickle?

1905
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,440
How am I going to get myself out of this pickle?

1906
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,100
With Long Boy!

1907
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:06,580
Long Boy to the rescue!

1908
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:10,380
Long Boy!

1909
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:11,480
Long Boy!

1910
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:21,500
See?

1911
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:23,500
Now, if nobody was attacking me...

1912
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:26,400
I'd totally be fine in Tetris.

1913
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:29,820
I am my own worst enemy.

1914
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,400
Oh, no.

1915
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:35,040
I died again.

1916
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:49,400
Okay.

1917
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:50,800
This is a good warm-up.

1918
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:51,840
This is a good warm-up, right?

1919
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:53,400
Yeah.

1920
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:54,240
Oh!

1921
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,080
Oh, I think I messed that up.

1922
01:36:58,600 --> 01:36:59,380
But that's fine.

1923
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:02,160
L... L... L...

1924
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,040
Minto.

1925
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:12,460
Sometimes when the orange and the mint blocks go next to each other, they kind of look like brown.

1926
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:14,640
You know?

1927
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:17,570
An hour and a half out?

1928
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:17,950
Wait!

1929
01:37:18,410 --> 01:37:20,270
An hour and a half late for a party?

1930
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:22,970
Go have fun!

1931
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:25,830
You're going to a... party.

1932
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:26,910
T.F.T.I.

1933
01:37:28,030 --> 01:37:29,230
But also...

1934
01:37:29,230 --> 01:37:29,970
Oh!

1935
01:37:30,730 --> 01:37:31,330
Wait!

1936
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:31,870
What?

1937
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:34,090
Why is the game attacking me?

1938
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:37,990
Why is the game attacking me?

1939
01:37:39,170 --> 01:37:39,770
What?

1940
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:42,850
This is zen mode!

1941
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:02,170
Why am I getting attacked in zen mode?

1942
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:03,030
Where's the zen?

1943
01:38:05,890 --> 01:38:07,050
What's going on?

1944
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:14,310
Is it because people are angry that I haven't made a new lobby?

1945
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:15,070
A new room?

1946
01:38:15,410 --> 01:38:16,650
Is that what's going on?

1947
01:38:16,830 --> 01:38:17,610
Is the game over?

1948
01:38:21,610 --> 01:38:22,990
Is that what's going on?

1949
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:23,710
I'm so confused!

1950
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:29,210
Why am I getting attacked in zen mode?

1951
01:38:31,810 --> 01:38:33,350
Why is my game haunted?

1952
01:38:38,590 --> 01:38:39,110
Oh!

1953
01:38:39,170 --> 01:38:39,810
I messed up!

1954
01:38:40,150 --> 01:38:42,790
I am my own worst enemy, truly.

1955
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:54,920
Hi raiders!

1956
01:39:00,070 --> 01:39:00,590
Hello!

1957
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:02,210
I couldn't say the name.

1958
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:02,950
I think it was alien.

1959
01:39:03,290 --> 01:39:04,170
Thank you for the raid!

1960
01:39:05,770 --> 01:39:06,570
Oh my god!

1961
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:07,350
I'm getting attacked!

1962
01:39:08,770 --> 01:39:09,890
I'm getting attacked!

1963
01:39:10,490 --> 01:39:11,550
What is happening?

1964
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:13,930
Guys,

1965
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:20,230
it's over for me.

1966
01:39:20,370 --> 01:39:22,790
Even zen mode thinks I suck.

1967
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:25,910
Even zen mode is just like, just give up.

1968
01:39:27,110 --> 01:39:27,570
No!

1969
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:29,950
I'm gonna have my shounen anime arc!

1970
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:31,130
Please!

1971
01:39:31,130 --> 01:39:32,590
Just let me prove it to you!

1972
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:36,950
Saki, thanks for the five gifts!

1973
01:39:58,360 --> 01:39:59,440
Return to venue!

1974
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:00,140
Oh, sorry.

1975
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:05,840
Sorry.

1976
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:05,880
Sorry.

1977
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:06,940
We can start.

1978
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:11,140
I was getting attacked?

1979
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,540
See, I was getting attacked in zen mode.

1980
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:26,640
Was I actually?

1981
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:27,780
Oh shoot, I need to pay attention.

1982
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:28,680
I need to pay attention.

1983
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:29,340
Fast.

1984
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:30,560
I've trained for this.

1985
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:32,380
I've trained for this.

1986
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:41,180
Oh!

1987
01:40:41,180 --> 01:40:41,900
No!

1988
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:42,720
Wait.

1989
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:45,580
Let's get out of here.

1990
01:40:57,380 --> 01:41:01,040
Gosh, this soundtrack is so nostalgic though.

1991
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:03,700
I remember this from when I used to play.

1992
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:06,540
Oh my gosh.

1993
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:16,160
Yeah!

1994
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,060
Take that!

1995
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:18,820
Oh wait.

1996
01:41:19,020 --> 01:41:19,420
Oh.

1997
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:24,180
Oh, there we go.

1998
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:26,380
I almost had it.

1999
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,820
I'm just a little silly sometimes.

2000
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:30,840
Don't worry about it, guys.

2001
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:34,040
No!

2002
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:35,420
No, please!

2003
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:36,700
No, please!

2004
01:41:41,490 --> 01:41:42,310
It's not okay!

2005
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:43,850
Everything is bad!

2006
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:44,930
Everything is bad!

2007
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:50,950
I got KO'd by a weeb!

2008
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:00,220
The soundtrack gives visual novel to my games.

2009
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:02,940
Guys, I was so zenned out.

2010
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:04,900
I wasn't even looking at you guys.

2011
01:42:04,940 --> 01:42:05,840
I wasn't looking at anything.

2012
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:07,020
I was just in the zen.

2013
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:09,600
I was just...

2014
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:12,860
Why are they so stinky?

2015
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:15,460
It's

2016
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:21,240
all zenned out.

2017
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:27,070
In this lobby, you're always KO'd by a weeb.

2018
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:27,750
True.

2019
01:42:29,150 --> 01:42:29,630
Anyway,

2020
01:42:34,730 --> 01:42:35,850
sorry about that.

2021
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:37,130
Oof.

2022
01:42:40,230 --> 01:42:41,250
Familiar is scary.

2023
01:42:41,490 --> 01:42:42,910
I think Sushi Man is scarier.

2024
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:49,460
Some of these people have like cra...

2025
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:50,540
Oh, Grape is back.

2026
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,100
They have crazy...

2027
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:53,180
Oh, OSK is still here.

2028
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:55,320
They have crazy speed.

2029
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:57,360
Say

2030
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:06,470
something really crazy for the clip.

2031
01:43:07,810 --> 01:43:08,290
What?

2032
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:38,860
Cut for a bit.

2033
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:39,860
How many games have you won?

2034
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:43,740
Of course!

2035
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:47,580
I'm winning every game because I'm playing with you guys.

2036
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:56,780
Obviously.

2037
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:56,960
Obviously.

2038
01:43:58,500 --> 01:43:58,940
Not

2039
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:05,140
the tease.

2040
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:06,980
Not the tease spin.

2041
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:11,260
When they...

2042
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:13,400
When they kind of like wobble it in there.

2043
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:15,540
They're just like, do you want me to place it?

2044
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:17,340
It's called the tease spin.

2045
01:44:18,980 --> 01:44:19,420
Yeah,

2046
01:44:45,070 --> 01:44:46,570
this is Remilia's Scarlet Reel.

2047
01:44:48,330 --> 01:44:50,910
They would be better, but they're playing from Gensokyo.

2048
01:44:51,010 --> 01:44:53,030
So, she's got some lag, you know.

2049
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:18,180
Can change settings.

2050
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:29,660
The pang.

2051
01:45:38,950 --> 01:45:39,750
Tetris Noobie.

2052
01:45:40,050 --> 01:45:40,970
Get out of here.

2053
01:45:41,050 --> 01:45:42,650
You wouldn't be top 40 then.

2054
01:45:46,110 --> 01:45:47,310
We can watch the king.

2055
01:45:59,890 --> 01:46:01,210
She didn't want to win, it seems.

2056
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:02,470
Yeah, that's okay.

2057
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:07,720
Oh.

2058
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:09,840
You got him next time.

2059
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:10,940
Get him next time, Tiger.

2060
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:13,420
That happened to me too.

2061
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:14,340
Maybe I'm just as good.

2062
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:15,180
Oh.

2063
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:16,200
Oh.

2064
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:21,780
Someone gets a badge.

2065
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:26,420
Where do you see the badge at?

2066
01:46:30,650 --> 01:46:32,850
The feeling of being subjected.

2067
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:35,870
Sorry.

2068
01:46:37,490 --> 01:46:38,210
Everybody

2069
01:46:45,630 --> 01:46:46,490
I watch wins.

2070
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:26,300
The curse of observation.

2071
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,020
Kazanya Boy.

2072
01:47:32,380 --> 01:47:32,600
Oh.

2073
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:34,880
I was going to say, how are you surviving this?

2074
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:46,030
Yeah, it's...

2075
01:47:46,050 --> 01:47:47,730
Maybe I'll take off my glasses.

2076
01:47:47,790 --> 01:47:48,970
I might do better, you know.

2077
01:48:00,010 --> 01:48:01,730
See, I told you.

2078
01:48:01,730 --> 01:48:02,970
I only watch the winners.

2079
01:48:05,090 --> 01:48:06,210
I told you.

2080
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:09,410
He really hates Mondays.

2081
01:48:09,450 --> 01:48:11,430
That's why he's so happy it's Friday.

2082
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:14,030
Duh.

2083
01:48:15,210 --> 01:48:15,770
162.

2084
01:48:17,450 --> 01:48:19,330
I guess it could be worse, right?

2085
01:48:21,410 --> 01:48:22,610
Where am I?

2086
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:23,250
Oh.

2087
01:48:24,330 --> 01:48:24,890
Oh.

2088
01:48:24,910 --> 01:48:26,050
There I am.

2089
01:48:28,890 --> 01:48:30,150
You were supposed to get out!

2090
01:48:32,410 --> 01:48:33,010
GG.

2091
01:48:33,430 --> 01:48:34,030
GG.

2092
01:48:34,990 --> 01:48:35,590
GG.

2093
01:48:35,790 --> 01:48:36,350
GG.

2094
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:37,050
GG.

2095
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:37,890
GG.

2096
01:48:38,730 --> 01:48:39,330
GG.

2097
01:48:39,530 --> 01:48:39,910
GG is everybody.

2098
01:48:43,390 --> 01:48:45,890
Can you clone yourself some multiple people?

2099
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:51,870
Alrighty.

2100
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:52,470
Hmm.

2101
01:48:54,090 --> 01:48:56,190
And Phantom, if you're reading this...

2102
01:48:56,190 --> 01:48:57,010
I...

2103
01:48:57,010 --> 01:48:57,310
I am.

2104
01:48:57,330 --> 01:48:57,910
I am!

2105
01:48:58,050 --> 01:48:59,370
I'm reading both chats.

2106
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:01,470
Mini-boy!

2107
01:49:02,150 --> 01:49:03,270
Thanks for two months!

2108
01:49:03,950 --> 01:49:04,450
GG's.

2109
01:49:05,050 --> 01:49:09,530
I always wonder why I added the O.S.K.

2110
01:49:09,530 --> 01:49:09,790
badge.

2111
01:49:10,130 --> 01:49:11,310
Where do you see the badge?

2112
01:49:11,490 --> 01:49:12,450
Oh, it may be up in here.

2113
01:49:16,030 --> 01:49:16,530
Nice!

2114
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:21,250
Cool!

2115
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:28,550
Let's have... a fun time.

2116
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:34,510
Made me... armpits?

2117
01:49:38,090 --> 01:49:38,570
No.

2118
01:49:40,430 --> 01:49:42,630
Let's have a bad time.

2119
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:44,410
Can you sleep in GG?

2120
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:45,710
Going to watch from bed with cat.

2121
01:49:45,930 --> 01:49:47,750
I want to watch in bed with cat.

2122
01:49:51,250 --> 01:49:53,030
Let's have a bad time.

2123
01:49:58,070 --> 01:49:59,450
Made Mint's room.

2124
01:50:00,070 --> 01:50:02,590
Get out of my room, you freaks!

2125
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:06,910
You weirdos.

2126
01:50:08,190 --> 01:50:10,550
What are you doing in my room, huh?

2127
01:50:14,010 --> 01:50:15,230
Whoa, whoa, already?

2128
01:50:16,070 --> 01:50:16,830
Please.

2129
01:50:17,730 --> 01:50:18,790
Show some mercy.

2130
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:21,350
Show some mercy, please.

2131
01:50:21,350 --> 01:50:21,690
Please.

2132
01:50:22,110 --> 01:50:24,350
Please, on this floor, so...

2133
01:50:28,690 --> 01:50:29,290
Okay.

2134
01:50:29,990 --> 01:50:31,370
Got out of that for now.

2135
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:33,490
Out of that for now.

2136
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:36,170
Oh, gosh.

2137
01:50:40,470 --> 01:50:41,070
Okay.

2138
01:50:42,230 --> 01:50:42,830
Wait.

2139
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:44,030
You know what?

2140
01:50:44,030 --> 01:50:44,330
That works.

2141
01:50:44,690 --> 01:50:49,410
I could set up a T-spin there, but I'm too nervous.

2142
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:53,330
I'm too nervous.

2143
01:50:54,930 --> 01:50:55,370
No!

2144
01:50:56,330 --> 01:50:57,130
Don't do this.

2145
01:50:57,290 --> 01:50:57,730
Please.

2146
01:50:58,350 --> 01:50:58,790
There.

2147
01:50:58,950 --> 01:51:00,170
I got rid of it.

2148
01:51:00,310 --> 01:51:00,990
Oh, my gosh.

2149
01:51:01,110 --> 01:51:02,230
I got rid of it.

2150
01:51:02,390 --> 01:51:03,930
I got rid of it!

2151
01:51:04,570 --> 01:51:05,150
Uh-oh.

2152
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:06,550
Uh-oh.

2153
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:07,910
I don't know if I can get rid of this, though.

2154
01:51:11,150 --> 01:51:12,030
Oh, shoot.

2155
01:51:12,630 --> 01:51:13,070
Oh.

2156
01:51:13,610 --> 01:51:14,050
Ha!

2157
01:51:19,150 --> 01:51:20,110
We did it.

2158
01:51:20,110 --> 01:51:21,430
Oh...

2159
01:51:23,470 --> 01:51:25,430
Oh, it's the same.

2160
01:51:25,690 --> 01:51:29,130
Everything is just bleak and sad.

2161
01:51:29,610 --> 01:51:34,070
Oh, no, no, wait, no, please!

2162
01:51:34,450 --> 01:51:35,990
Don't do this to me!

2163
01:51:36,170 --> 01:51:36,370
No!

2164
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:44,120
That was too slow.

2165
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:48,420
He did one shot at me.

2166
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:50,080
How the heck?

2167
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:53,140
You got killed, man.

2168
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:53,760
Oh, no!

2169
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:01,680
You got killed, you got killed!

2170
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:05,740
Look, that guy... if that guy targets you...

2171
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:07,100
Rest in...

2172
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:11,400
That guy targets you, rest in pieces.

2173
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:16,700
You're stacking pretty high, so no surprise.

2174
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:17,360
I know.

2175
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:19,920
I was trying to get it out.

2176
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:24,710
I try to keep myself low, but I know you gotta stack high to retaliate.

2177
01:52:25,340 --> 01:52:25,840
You know?

2178
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:28,980
But I'm not fast enough to return the hits.

2179
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:31,180
So...

2180
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:33,500
Are you okay?

2181
01:52:33,700 --> 01:52:34,140
I'm okay.

2182
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:36,240
I'm recovering from...

2183
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:38,720
From the sea virus.

2184
01:52:40,620 --> 01:52:42,220
But I'm negative now.

2185
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:48,640
I can return to being a functioning member of society.

2186
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:50,880
Wait, where'd Picnic go?

2187
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:55,480
Ray and

2188
01:52:58,680 --> 01:52:58,940
Rex!

2189
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:00,340
Metal Gear Rex!

2190
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:07,080
We have Metal Gear Ray and Metal Gear Rex...

2191
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:09,740
Right next to each other.

2192
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:20,400
Hey there, Negative.

2193
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:27,200
I have Goatee.

2194
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:29,140
No, I don't.

2195
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:32,020
Oh, a Goatee!

2196
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:17,630
Oh, sheesh.

2197
01:54:18,050 --> 01:54:18,650
Anyway...

2198
01:54:21,270 --> 01:54:23,110
I thought I've just read it wrong.

2199
01:54:23,510 --> 01:54:24,170
I was like...

2200
01:54:24,170 --> 01:54:25,910
That doesn't even make any sense.

2201
01:54:26,050 --> 01:54:27,090
How would I have that?

2202
01:54:27,450 --> 01:54:29,830
It's not something you have, I don't think.

2203
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:35,340
I got KO'd by OSK.

2204
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:39,880
It's time to put the freaky glasses back on.

2205
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:42,180
Okay, Mom.

2206
01:55:00,270 --> 01:55:01,510
Is that better?

2207
01:55:03,810 --> 01:55:05,550
Put those freak glasses...

2208
01:55:05,550 --> 01:55:06,710
I'm not a freak!

2209
01:55:10,610 --> 01:55:13,010
My name is Mid Phantom!

2210
01:55:13,530 --> 01:55:16,250
And Wins Not Freak Phantom!

2211
01:55:17,690 --> 01:55:19,990
I don't think anyone can match her.

2212
01:55:22,450 --> 01:55:26,140
My name is Mid Phantom!

2213
01:55:26,820 --> 01:55:30,040
Barely anybody even knows my name, has it?

2214
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:32,440
We can't change it.

2215
01:55:34,620 --> 01:55:36,140
I'm sorry.

2216
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:36,220
I'm sorry.

2217
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:38,060
I'm sorry.

2218
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:39,560
It's FFF.

2219
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:41,320
Freaky Phantom Friday!

2220
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:52,840
How to hold?

2221
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:56,460
In this game, I'm pretty sure it's Shift, right?

2222
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:01,360
Shift is hold, right?

2223
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:06,580
Shift or C?

2224
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:08,200
Oh, it defaults to C.

2225
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:10,540
Oh, I see, I see.

2226
01:56:10,860 --> 01:56:11,660
I see!

2227
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:14,180
I see, I see!

2228
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:16,840
He's on your boy!

2229
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:24,110
Congrats for first badge!

2230
01:56:25,630 --> 01:56:26,190
I

2231
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:30,100
have a badge?

2232
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:33,120
Wait, someone said congrats on your first badge!

2233
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:48,360
Wait, is Remilia here too?

2234
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:50,560
Zeus!

2235
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:54,320
Peepy Island.

2236
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:55,100
Sushi.

2237
01:56:55,300 --> 01:56:56,320
We got all the...

2238
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:59,500
We have all the regulars up at the top.

2239
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:01,720
Fast

2240
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:12,920
for my 5 business day replay.

2241
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:15,340
Too real.

2242
01:57:16,930 --> 01:57:17,340
Small

2243
01:57:31,580 --> 01:57:32,560
thing in my chest.

2244
01:57:39,860 --> 01:57:41,860
Flood just flooded them!

2245
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:46,420
Flood flooded them!

2246
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:48,120
Holy moly.

2247
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:49,700
I got 148.

2248
01:57:51,020 --> 01:57:52,040
Badge up!

2249
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:53,500
Is

2250
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:57,060
this...

2251
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:59,000
This is my badge?

2252
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:00,680
I got a badge!

2253
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:02,260
Yippee!

2254
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:10,280
145?

2255
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:12,080
Oh wait, I'm not so low.

2256
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:12,360
Alright.

2257
01:58:12,580 --> 01:58:12,940
Yeah.

2258
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:15,480
One...

2259
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:16,720
Freak Phantom!

2260
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,580
Wait, Garlimaw.

2261
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:26,040
Cool.

2262
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:27,400
G...

2263
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:28,400
Oh, I can't type.

2264
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:29,420
Get out of here.

2265
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:30,920
Don't add me to your friends list.

2266
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:35,320
Now you can maul and tilt in...

2267
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:37,080
Jolica gets out there.

2268
01:58:37,620 --> 01:58:38,100
Haha.

2269
01:58:39,580 --> 01:58:40,060
G.

2270
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:40,320
G.

2271
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:45,720
You...

2272
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:46,980
You will never...

2273
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:47,400
Wait...

2274
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:51,180
You will never KO OSK.

2275
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:52,160
Start the game.

2276
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:52,980
Hahaha.

2277
01:59:13,370 --> 01:59:15,830
I gotta rile them up a little bit, you know.

2278
01:59:15,970 --> 01:59:16,830
I don't think they're...

2279
01:59:16,830 --> 01:59:20,070
I don't think they're being sweaty enough here, you know.

2280
01:59:20,710 --> 01:59:21,750
I don't think...

2281
01:59:21,750 --> 01:59:22,450
We gotta...

2282
01:59:22,450 --> 01:59:24,910
We gotta put a little bit more competition into this.

2283
01:59:25,070 --> 01:59:25,310
Oh...

2284
01:59:25,310 --> 01:59:25,830
Oops.

2285
01:59:26,650 --> 01:59:27,570
Oh shoot.

2286
01:59:27,570 --> 01:59:27,570
Shoot.

2287
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:29,210
Hey, hey, hey!

2288
01:59:29,690 --> 01:59:31,830
I mean, yeah, that's what I wanted!

2289
01:59:32,550 --> 01:59:33,070
Oh,

2290
01:59:36,590 --> 01:59:37,010
it hurts.

2291
01:59:37,330 --> 01:59:37,850
Okay.

2292
01:59:38,190 --> 01:59:39,550
This is fine, probably.

2293
01:59:40,410 --> 01:59:40,930
Yeah!

2294
01:59:41,570 --> 01:59:42,310
That's fine!

2295
01:59:42,950 --> 01:59:43,470
Probably!

2296
01:59:44,490 --> 01:59:45,430
Oh, shoot.

2297
01:59:45,530 --> 01:59:46,130
I'm throwing.

2298
01:59:49,230 --> 01:59:50,470
I'm throwing for real?

2299
01:59:52,330 --> 01:59:52,850
No!

2300
01:59:56,610 --> 01:59:57,510
I'm gonna die.

2301
01:59:57,690 --> 01:59:58,930
This is where I die!

2302
01:59:59,190 --> 02:00:00,310
This is where I die!

2303
02:00:00,570 --> 02:00:01,730
Freak phantom!

2304
02:00:02,010 --> 02:00:03,010
Freak phantom!

2305
02:00:06,590 --> 02:00:07,890
I'm from Colombia!

2306
02:00:08,150 --> 02:00:08,510
Let's go

2307
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:12,460
for two months!

2308
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:13,020
Thank you!

2309
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:17,460
I didn't even place 200.

2310
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:18,560
So sad.

2311
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:28,500
Couldn't match the freak.

2312
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:37,040
Come back after two hours of overtime for a good stream!

2313
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:37,620
Welcome!

2314
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:38,300
Otsu!

2315
02:00:39,620 --> 02:00:40,340
Otsu Otsu.

2316
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:42,780
Otsu is a trilingual maid.

2317
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:44,000
Yes!

2318
02:00:47,460 --> 02:00:48,180
Yes!

2319
02:00:48,260 --> 02:00:48,700
Yes!

2320
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:49,620
I like it!

2321
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:51,600
Hello.

2322
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:52,740
How are you?

2323
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:54,320
Very good, thank you.

2324
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:56,320
I love you.

2325
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:02,000
I'm... I'm Minto.

2326
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:15,820
I don't like it.

2327
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:19,680
I'm Minto.

2328
02:01:20,060 --> 02:01:21,200
Hello, Minto.

2329
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:24,020
Hello, Minto.

2330
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:26,160
Hello, Minto.

2331
02:01:26,160 --> 02:01:26,480
Hello.

2332
02:01:52,550 --> 02:01:53,000
Oh, hello.

2333
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:53,780
Hi, Minto.

2334
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:54,140
Hello.

2335
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:56,200
Hello, Minto.

2336
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:56,600
Hello.

2337
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:02,340
Hello.

2338
02:02:02,340 --> 02:02:03,440
We're freaking here!

2339
02:02:05,940 --> 02:02:07,440
This guy...

2340
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:11,420
This guy KO'd me.

2341
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:14,160
Everyone target the FIFO!

2342
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:16,400
Target the FIFO!

2343
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:20,560
FIFI FOFUM!

2344
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:23,540
I smell your death on the line.

2345
02:02:24,540 --> 02:02:26,860
Ring ring, pick up the phone.

2346
02:02:27,380 --> 02:02:28,980
It's death calling.

2347
02:02:32,340 --> 02:02:33,660
Oh, yeah, yeah, there we go.

2348
02:02:40,100 --> 02:02:41,340
That didn't rhyme.

2349
02:02:51,050 --> 02:02:56,670
What if my dear friend Noko-tan was freaky and said, Freak-a-noko-noko-noko-noko-tan-tan.

2350
02:02:59,590 --> 02:03:00,670
Wow, what if?

2351
02:03:01,210 --> 02:03:02,950
That would be cra- Oh no, it's Flood!

2352
02:03:04,430 --> 02:03:05,450
It's our winner!

2353
02:03:06,630 --> 02:03:07,590
It's the champion!

2354
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:28,460
He's so fast.

2355
02:03:28,620 --> 02:03:29,400
Flood is crazy.

2356
02:03:30,020 --> 02:03:32,480
I think though, maybe the fastest is Tsushima.

2357
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:37,220
But he's fast, but he's messy, you know?

2358
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:40,080
Oh.

2359
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:40,840
Oh, it's King.

2360
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:42,100
The King!

2361
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:47,200
Someone take this guy out!

2362
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:48,760
You'll get a badge!

2363
02:03:58,020 --> 02:03:59,040
You'll get a badge.

2364
02:03:59,140 --> 02:04:00,120
I'll gift it to you.

2365
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:05,440
I'll personally give you a badge.

2366
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:12,660
Oh, almost save.

2367
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:13,160
Oh.

2368
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:14,040
Oh, no.

2369
02:04:14,240 --> 02:04:14,700
Oh, buddy.

2370
02:04:18,340 --> 02:04:20,020
My chronos!

2371
02:04:20,740 --> 02:04:22,200
Here's your badge!

2372
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:31,820
There's your badge!

2373
02:04:32,700 --> 02:04:34,040
Freak phantom!

2374
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:36,520
Certified freak.

2375
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:39,320
Whee!

2376
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:44,820
You're a certified freak!

2377
02:04:44,820 --> 02:04:45,440
Freak!

2378
02:04:56,630 --> 02:04:57,350
Oh, see?

2379
02:04:57,470 --> 02:04:58,890
The long boys are the same color!

2380
02:04:59,110 --> 02:04:59,690
So it's perfect.

2381
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:05,580
Certified freak.

2382
02:05:06,260 --> 02:05:07,400
Seven days a week.

2383
02:05:17,140 --> 02:05:18,000
Creepy island.

2384
02:05:19,160 --> 02:05:19,640
My

2385
02:05:29,070 --> 02:05:30,730
throat is actually really hurting today.

2386
02:05:31,050 --> 02:05:33,230
So I might just do a few...

2387
02:05:34,810 --> 02:05:36,250
Because I've been coughing a lot.

2388
02:05:36,530 --> 02:05:38,030
I might just do a few more games.

2389
02:05:42,380 --> 02:05:43,900
Tetris is very relaxing.

2390
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:48,340
That's why I feel like I need a shower after this.

2391
02:05:50,100 --> 02:05:50,620
Oh!

2392
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:53,740
Oh!

2393
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:54,320
Sushi Man!

2394
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:56,560
Will Sushi Man finally get a win?

2395
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:01,700
Oh my god, the recovery!

2396
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:05,960
We're watching two gods go against each other.

2397
02:06:06,060 --> 02:06:06,540
This is insane.

2398
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:11,940
Sushi Man gets a win!

2399
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:13,320
Sushi Man gets a win!

2400
02:06:16,840 --> 02:06:17,360
Sushi Man gets a win!

2401
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:17,980
No way!

2402
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:21,900
Sushi Man's crazy!

2403
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:25,500
Oh, I almost made it to 200.

2404
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:27,600
GG's!

2405
02:06:29,220 --> 02:06:30,440
Get better soon, man.

2406
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:31,060
Thank you!

2407
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:31,920
I will, I will.

2408
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:33,040
Tomorrow...

2409
02:06:33,700 --> 02:06:35,500
I plan on playing...

2410
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:38,960
If you thought this was a callback...

2411
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:39,900
Wait until tomorrow!

2412
02:06:40,020 --> 02:06:41,460
I'm playing Doom 64!

2413
02:06:41,460 --> 02:06:41,540
Doom 64!

2414
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:47,100
But I'm actually playing Doom 64 tomorrow.

2415
02:06:47,740 --> 02:06:48,260
So...

2416
02:06:48,260 --> 02:06:49,060
Hello!

2417
02:06:49,420 --> 02:06:50,060
Hello!

2418
02:06:52,460 --> 02:06:53,120
No!

2419
02:07:04,010 --> 02:07:04,340
Okay.

2420
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:06,240
What's the next one?

2421
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:12,140
Did

2422
02:07:16,290 --> 02:07:18,050
you see the prequel for the new...

2423
02:07:18,050 --> 02:07:19,250
Or the trailer.

2424
02:07:19,430 --> 02:07:20,070
It's a prequel!

2425
02:07:22,990 --> 02:07:24,050
Oh my goodness.

2426
02:07:24,650 --> 02:07:26,810
What a sweet sounding soundtrack.

2427
02:07:28,310 --> 02:07:31,270
Surely nothing bad can happen in this game...

2428
02:07:31,270 --> 02:07:34,930
If the soundtrack is so cute and sweet.

2429
02:07:35,730 --> 02:07:36,410
Right?

2430
02:07:37,630 --> 02:07:38,310
Right?

2431
02:07:39,670 --> 02:07:40,350
I

2432
02:07:43,540 --> 02:07:46,220
should probably not build up anymore.

2433
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:47,300
Oh no.

2434
02:07:47,380 --> 02:07:49,160
This is why I shouldn't build up anymore!

2435
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:50,560
Oh no, please!

2436
02:07:51,660 --> 02:07:53,240
Please, Long Boy, save me!

2437
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:55,500
Long Boy!

2438
02:07:55,660 --> 02:07:57,620
Long Boy, won't you come down?

2439
02:07:57,680 --> 02:07:58,080
Long Boy!

2440
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:03,080
Thank you, Long Boy.

2441
02:08:03,780 --> 02:08:04,980
You saved me.

2442
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:06,200
Long Boy!

2443
02:08:14,730 --> 02:08:15,330
Goodness.

2444
02:08:17,290 --> 02:08:17,890
No.

2445
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:22,600
What's that sound?

2446
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:24,260
What's that sound?

2447
02:08:24,580 --> 02:08:24,940
Oh.

2448
02:08:24,980 --> 02:08:25,860
Oh, shoot.

2449
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:27,760
Oh.

2450
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:32,360
Long Boy!

2451
02:08:33,660 --> 02:08:35,220
Long Boy, save me!

2452
02:08:36,160 --> 02:08:36,760
Long

2453
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:42,380
Boy, I believe.

2454
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:43,740
This is it.

2455
02:08:43,940 --> 02:08:44,360
Oh no.

2456
02:08:44,540 --> 02:08:44,760
Oh.

2457
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:45,320
Shoot.

2458
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:46,280
Oh, shoot.

2459
02:08:46,540 --> 02:08:47,460
Long Boy.

2460
02:08:47,820 --> 02:08:49,040
I'll use you...

2461
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:50,860
In my final moments.

2462
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:52,920
In my...

2463
02:08:53,260 --> 02:08:53,820
Oh, shoot.

2464
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:55,260
Long Boy.

2465
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:02,620
Sad anime scene music happening right now.

2466
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:04,300
I know sad music.

2467
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:06,200
I'm out.

2468
02:09:07,860 --> 02:09:08,720
So sad.

2469
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:12,580
I got a little village child in a medieval anime.

2470
02:09:13,160 --> 02:09:14,580
Who's about to die.

2471
02:09:15,060 --> 02:09:15,540
Wow!

2472
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:18,880
Did you see how the colors are so cool?

2473
02:09:20,580 --> 02:09:21,180
When

2474
02:09:25,430 --> 02:09:27,190
the left bar is just all red.

2475
02:09:27,590 --> 02:09:28,670
Sad times.

2476
02:09:29,730 --> 02:09:32,150
Oh, did she read my comments?

2477
02:09:32,230 --> 02:09:32,630
Shut up!

2478
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:41,500
I'll be okay.

2479
02:09:41,500 --> 02:10:01,400
Okay, I have some medicine that I can take, but I ran out of my cold medicine, because that's what I was taking before, but I have some throat stuff that I can take, or learning the tragic back story of a heroine.

2480
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:07,860
She says, all I ever wanted to do was be loved.

2481
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:11,640
All I wanted was a family that would love me.

2482
02:10:13,060 --> 02:10:22,000
But alas, I must fight in this cruel world, in this war that I didn't ask for.

2483
02:10:25,060 --> 02:10:26,380
Just like Himmel the Hero.

2484
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:28,980
Himmel the Hero.

2485
02:10:29,660 --> 02:10:32,160
That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.

2486
02:10:35,660 --> 02:10:37,780
Himmel the Hero would have given us Longboy.

2487
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:39,620
I think Himmel the Hero is Longboy.

2488
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:44,180
If it were just a little light blue.

2489
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:46,440
Stop dancing!

2490
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:52,080
Sounds

2491
02:10:55,850 --> 02:10:59,990
like something out of Final Fantasy XVI.

2492
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:08,120
He was a good friend.

2493
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:09,760
Himmel the Hero.

2494
02:11:10,600 --> 02:11:12,640
He wasn't just a friend, he was a hero.

2495
02:11:13,140 --> 02:11:14,020
Get it right.

2496
02:11:14,260 --> 02:11:15,020
It's in his name.

2497
02:11:15,660 --> 02:11:17,060
He wasn't Himmel the Friend.

2498
02:11:17,540 --> 02:11:18,840
He was Himmel the Hero.

2499
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:18,940
He was Himmel the Hero.

2500
02:11:19,960 --> 02:11:21,040
He wasn't just a friend, he was Himmel the Hero.

2501
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:21,040
He wasn't just a friend, he was Himmel the Hero.

2502
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:25,360
How dare you disgrace his legacy like that.

2503
02:11:31,810 --> 02:11:34,110
Just don't friendzone him like that.

2504
02:11:34,330 --> 02:11:42,190
I know Free Ren did, but she still called him by his title.

2505
02:11:47,670 --> 02:11:52,010
I'm so excited for when more Free Ren comes out.

2506
02:11:52,170 --> 02:11:54,270
I've just been thinking about it like every day.

2507
02:11:54,270 --> 02:11:56,410
I'm just like, when will we get more Free Ren?

2508
02:11:56,850 --> 02:11:57,390
Please.

2509
02:11:58,010 --> 02:12:01,150
But we are getting, what, the set new season of Oshinoko.

2510
02:12:03,210 --> 02:12:04,650
I'm kind of excited about that.

2511
02:12:06,470 --> 02:12:08,270
Someone stole my mood ring.

2512
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:16,240
You the booster!

2513
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:18,240
Thank you!

2514
02:12:22,530 --> 02:12:24,490
I haven't watched Dungeon Mist yet.

2515
02:12:24,830 --> 02:12:29,310
I know a lot of people really like that show.

2516
02:12:32,910 --> 02:12:36,770
Usually I don't like watching shows about food because they make me hungry.

2517
02:12:37,390 --> 02:12:39,030
Like I watched Food Wars.

2518
02:12:39,310 --> 02:12:40,070
I didn't finish it.

2519
02:12:40,270 --> 02:12:42,770
I eventually stopped watching.

2520
02:12:42,870 --> 02:12:44,210
I don't remember what season.

2521
02:12:44,450 --> 02:12:47,150
I think maybe I only watched the first season.

2522
02:12:51,850 --> 02:12:53,430
It's the best anime of the season.

2523
02:12:55,910 --> 02:12:56,990
Watch it while eating.

2524
02:12:57,250 --> 02:12:58,910
But my food never tastes so good.

2525
02:12:59,070 --> 02:13:00,290
Like it's theirs, you know?

2526
02:13:02,710 --> 02:13:06,250
I did see though, like today it got confirmed, the second season or something, right?

2527
02:13:06,370 --> 02:13:07,370
Like it was very recent.

2528
02:13:07,610 --> 02:13:09,290
Or yesterday or...

2529
02:13:10,750 --> 02:13:11,150
Oh,

2530
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:16,280
I know Blue Archive, the anime.

2531
02:13:19,160 --> 02:13:20,500
But I still play every day.

2532
02:13:28,180 --> 02:13:29,580
Dungeon Mist is a trigger show?

2533
02:13:30,120 --> 02:13:30,680
No way.

2534
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:36,180
Should I get, bring Giant Free Ren instead of Giant Doki next time we meet in Greenwood?

2535
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:39,020
Yes!

2536
02:13:39,640 --> 02:13:42,620
Actually, I also really want the Giant Free Ren plushie.

2537
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:51,340
My hands need a Tetris break.

2538
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:52,040
Oh, do it!

2539
02:13:56,120 --> 02:13:56,680
Cronos!

2540
02:13:59,460 --> 02:14:01,680
They're the one who knocked out OSK before.

2541
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:20,490
Level up, baby!

2542
02:14:23,110 --> 02:14:23,590
114.

2543
02:14:23,590 --> 02:14:24,510
Could be worse.

2544
02:14:27,170 --> 02:14:28,230
Could be worse.

2545
02:14:31,990 --> 02:14:34,130
So far Mint has won every single game.

2546
02:14:35,350 --> 02:14:35,830
GG.

2547
02:14:36,950 --> 02:14:39,810
Maybe next game, maybe LG?

2548
02:14:41,490 --> 02:14:42,450
Last game maybe?

2549
02:14:43,010 --> 02:14:43,890
One more game?

2550
02:14:44,310 --> 02:14:47,130
We can talk a little bit and then I'm gonna head out.

2551
02:14:48,230 --> 02:14:49,170
Didn't you lose?

2552
02:14:49,370 --> 02:14:49,810
Nope.

2553
02:14:50,490 --> 02:14:51,770
I don't know what you're talking about.

2554
02:14:57,290 --> 02:14:57,970
LG.

2555
02:15:01,290 --> 02:15:05,670
Thank you, Flood, for always posting that.

2556
02:15:07,210 --> 02:15:08,890
Press X to doubt?

2557
02:15:11,330 --> 02:15:13,390
I pressed X but nothing happened.

2558
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:19,240
I did say I would do this after every round.

2559
02:15:19,460 --> 02:15:20,280
Appreciate you.

2560
02:15:25,290 --> 02:15:26,410
What happened?

2561
02:15:27,970 --> 02:15:29,210
What just happened?

2562
02:15:34,510 --> 02:15:35,130
F?

2563
02:15:35,130 --> 02:15:36,370
Try pressing harder.

2564
02:15:44,990 --> 02:15:45,610
F.

2565
02:15:47,130 --> 02:15:47,750
F.

2566
02:15:50,270 --> 02:15:51,930
Top 100, baby!

2567
02:15:52,190 --> 02:15:53,850
I at least got top 100.

2568
02:15:54,170 --> 02:15:55,290
In the very beginning.

2569
02:15:55,650 --> 02:15:56,910
Then all the good people came.

2570
02:15:57,310 --> 02:15:58,170
So you know what.

2571
02:15:58,410 --> 02:15:59,030
Alright.

2572
02:15:59,330 --> 02:15:59,730
I'm done.

2573
02:15:59,730 --> 02:16:00,590
LG!

2574
02:16:00,870 --> 02:16:07,690
Let's hope... Let's aim for... Let's aim for... Let's have no expectations.

2575
02:16:11,730 --> 02:16:13,690
Let's have no expectations.

2576
02:16:19,990 --> 02:16:23,550
I like this song.

2577
02:16:28,730 --> 02:16:31,390
I'm building... I'm building...

2578
02:16:34,030 --> 02:16:37,190
I'm building... my empire.

2579
02:16:38,390 --> 02:16:40,430
Maybe we can... You know what?

2580
02:16:40,430 --> 02:16:41,310
I'm gonna long boy in there.

2581
02:16:41,490 --> 02:16:42,150
Might have been a mistake.

2582
02:16:42,370 --> 02:16:43,570
It was not a mistake.

2583
02:16:44,990 --> 02:16:47,190
I gotta strike first, you guys.

2584
02:16:47,430 --> 02:16:49,190
I'm the weakest link.

2585
02:16:50,390 --> 02:16:51,790
So I gotta strike first.

2586
02:16:52,950 --> 02:16:54,210
I gotta strike first!

2587
02:16:55,150 --> 02:16:56,730
I'm sorry, everybody else!

2588
02:16:57,070 --> 02:16:58,050
I'm sorry!

2589
02:16:59,750 --> 02:17:01,030
I killed you!

2590
02:17:01,390 --> 02:17:02,150
You stole me!

2591
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:08,000
Oh my god!

2592
02:17:08,080 --> 02:17:08,220
Wait!

2593
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:09,380
No, I... I'm still playing!

2594
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:10,340
I'm still in the game!

2595
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:12,400
I'm sorry!

2596
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:13,120
You stole me!

2597
02:17:13,340 --> 02:17:13,860
I'm sorry!

2598
02:17:14,300 --> 02:17:14,880
Oh, shoot!

2599
02:17:15,140 --> 02:17:15,560
Uh-oh.

2600
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:16,120
Uh-oh.

2601
02:17:16,520 --> 02:17:18,560
This is it.

2602
02:17:18,960 --> 02:17:20,100
Save me, long boy.

2603
02:17:21,600 --> 02:17:22,360
Long boy...

2604
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:30,300
I got so...

2605
02:17:49,580 --> 02:17:51,000
Karma for some reason.

2606
02:17:52,800 --> 02:17:54,040
Do you know what I mean?

2607
02:17:54,080 --> 02:17:54,620
He's in there.

2608
02:17:54,640 --> 02:17:55,240
He's dangerous.

2609
02:17:56,740 --> 02:17:58,340
Where at?

2610
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:24,600
I

2611
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:31,840
like when they just fall down.

2612
02:18:32,380 --> 02:18:33,600
So sad.

2613
02:18:34,180 --> 02:18:35,820
Thanks for killing me, Yippee!

2614
02:18:36,940 --> 02:18:37,340
Sorry.

2615
02:18:39,380 --> 02:18:40,560
I'm sorry.

2616
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:42,420
I'm sorry.

2617
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:55,460
No, I don't think I made it to 100.

2618
02:18:56,400 --> 02:18:57,660
I'm so shocked.

2619
02:18:59,540 --> 02:19:01,480
They really came for my neck.

2620
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:10,160
Glad I made it one match at least.

2621
02:19:10,280 --> 02:19:10,680
Let's go.

2622
02:19:21,060 --> 02:19:22,400
I'm so sleepy.

2623
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:22,600
I did this thing.

2624
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:24,780
I'm so sleepy.

2625
02:19:25,140 --> 02:19:25,660
I have to run fast.

2626
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:39,240
My toes are better than my fingers.

2627
02:19:39,580 --> 02:19:41,220
You can make this out of his toes!

2628
02:19:41,320 --> 02:19:42,000
I believe in you!

2629
02:19:44,560 --> 02:19:45,220
There we go!

2630
02:19:45,360 --> 02:19:46,140
Nice save!

2631
02:19:48,340 --> 02:19:49,700
Nice save!

2632
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:50,940
There you go!

2633
02:19:51,620 --> 02:19:55,100
Himmel the hero out to Himmel the long boy!

2634
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,200
Nice save!

2635
02:19:59,540 --> 02:20:00,520
Nice save!

2636
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:01,900
Nice save!

2637
02:20:02,680 --> 02:20:04,140
Your meds make you creepy?

2638
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:04,920
I don't think so.

2639
02:20:07,160 --> 02:20:11,820
But I have to... since their medicine is medicine from Japan...

2640
02:20:12,700 --> 02:20:19,160
I have to take... it's like... you have to take three pills three times a day.

2641
02:20:20,700 --> 02:20:21,900
It's so much.

2642
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:26,220
And I only had one left.

2643
02:20:27,240 --> 02:20:30,740
So I think that's why I'm coughing so much.

2644
02:20:30,760 --> 02:20:31,760
Because I have no cough.

2645
02:20:31,900 --> 02:20:32,900
Or suppressants anymore.

2646
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:35,780
Yeah, nine a day.

2647
02:20:35,860 --> 02:20:36,460
It's insane.

2648
02:20:37,540 --> 02:20:39,960
But a lot of Japanese medicine is like that.

2649
02:20:40,220 --> 02:20:42,860
Maybe because they put them in low doses, you know?

2650
02:20:43,060 --> 02:20:45,960
They don't do like super high doses for one pill.

2651
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:47,560
So...

2652
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:52,880
But it helped so much.

2653
02:20:56,480 --> 02:20:58,620
You are the best Tetris player of all time.

2654
02:20:58,680 --> 02:20:59,240
Maybe ever.

2655
02:21:00,820 --> 02:21:01,780
Thank you!

2656
02:21:05,660 --> 02:21:07,220
Yeah, they do low dosages.

2657
02:21:07,400 --> 02:21:07,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2658
02:21:08,100 --> 02:21:08,920
Oh, Chronos!

2659
02:21:10,460 --> 02:21:11,420
Nice save!

2660
02:21:14,100 --> 02:21:14,580
Wow!

2661
02:21:17,060 --> 02:21:18,940
Professionals are scary, man.

2662
02:21:21,340 --> 02:21:25,800
But it's also so fun just watching someone be good at what they do, you know?

2663
02:21:35,590 --> 02:21:37,610
I wore the Mintara socks to the store today.

2664
02:21:37,690 --> 02:21:39,010
They're a lot more comfortable than I was expecting.

2665
02:21:39,310 --> 02:21:40,010
No way!

2666
02:21:41,190 --> 02:21:41,930
Oh my gosh!

2667
02:21:42,070 --> 02:21:44,890
Thank you for gifting me a month of Tetris with the floor.

2668
02:21:45,710 --> 02:21:46,890
Thank you so much!

2669
02:21:48,490 --> 02:21:51,090
Chai is talking about Among Us and how Mint is gonna win.

2670
02:21:52,510 --> 02:21:53,250
Among Us.

2671
02:21:54,790 --> 02:21:55,670
Oh, doremi!

2672
02:21:55,710 --> 02:21:56,130
That's right.

2673
02:21:56,870 --> 02:21:57,450
Oh, here.

2674
02:22:01,660 --> 02:22:02,700
Were they in my...

2675
02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:04,700
Were they in the lobbies earlier?

2676
02:22:04,700 --> 02:22:06,100
I don't recognize the name.

2677
02:22:25,940 --> 02:22:27,880
They're a pretty famous Tetris player.

2678
02:22:28,100 --> 02:22:28,400
Really?

2679
02:22:29,460 --> 02:22:31,040
Of course they're...

2680
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:35,800
One of the best Tetris players in the world?

2681
02:22:39,020 --> 02:22:40,020
It's an honor.

2682
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:41,480
Holy cow!

2683
02:22:41,700 --> 02:22:42,840
I wonder if it's the real person.

2684
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:44,220
What did I get?

2685
02:22:44,960 --> 02:22:45,600
151!

2686
02:22:46,700 --> 02:22:51,200
At least 150 or more to see.

2687
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:54,660
To be a Pokémon master is my...

2688
02:22:54,660 --> 02:22:55,400
destiny!

2689
02:22:56,080 --> 02:22:56,700
Oh my gosh!

2690
02:22:56,720 --> 02:22:57,220
I'm Mew!

2691
02:23:00,540 --> 02:23:01,540
That's not so bad.

2692
02:23:01,640 --> 02:23:01,980
You know what?

2693
02:23:02,060 --> 02:23:04,080
I thought I was in like the 200s.

2694
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:06,640
But actually, I'm in 151!

2695
02:23:07,480 --> 02:23:09,420
I feel blessed by Doremi's presence.

2696
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:10,600
Lucky game!

2697
02:23:10,820 --> 02:23:12,080
Lucky... I KO'd someone.

2698
02:23:12,340 --> 02:23:13,560
I got 151.

2699
02:23:14,020 --> 02:23:17,500
Almost to the halfway point of getting top 100.

2700
02:23:20,940 --> 02:23:21,980
Excuse me!

2701
02:23:24,520 --> 02:23:27,780
Even though there was only 200 people.

2702
02:23:28,120 --> 02:23:29,120
That's fine though.

2703
02:23:30,700 --> 02:23:32,920
There was only 200 people but...

2704
02:23:35,300 --> 02:23:36,280
That's okay.

2705
02:23:37,020 --> 02:23:38,200
That's a-okay.

2706
02:23:40,580 --> 02:23:43,380
Thanks for playing with us.

2707
02:23:43,700 --> 02:23:44,400
Toho!

2708
02:23:44,480 --> 02:23:44,960
Oh my gosh!

2709
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:45,860
Toho!

2710
02:23:46,480 --> 02:23:47,900
Wait, what's her name?

2711
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:48,700
Is that a...

2712
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:51,800
Um... Clown Piece?

2713
02:23:52,720 --> 02:23:54,060
How do you send that?

2714
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:59,020
Yeah, how do you send Clown Piece?

2715
02:24:03,580 --> 02:24:06,580
Thanks for dropping by Intetrioman.

2716
02:24:06,700 --> 02:24:07,400
Thank you!

2717
02:24:08,020 --> 02:24:08,900
Clown Piece!

2718
02:24:11,240 --> 02:24:16,400
How do you- How do I send Clown... Oh, Clown Piece.

2719
02:24:18,280 --> 02:24:19,480
Clown Piece.

2720
02:24:22,280 --> 02:24:23,020
Clown.

2721
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:25,800
Clown Smug.

2722
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:26,660
Oh.

2723
02:24:26,720 --> 02:24:29,920
Clown... Smug.

2724
02:24:30,850 --> 02:24:31,520
Yippee!

2725
02:24:34,890 --> 02:24:35,760
Let's enter!

2726
02:24:36,630 --> 02:24:38,020
Clown Smug.

2727
02:24:40,970 --> 02:24:43,900
Have fun Tetris.

2728
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:45,040
Tetrio-ing.

2729
02:24:52,020 --> 02:24:53,200
And we're out.

2730
02:24:58,110 --> 02:25:00,010
Give me one second you guys.

2731
02:25:00,210 --> 02:25:02,050
I actually- We will go to the maid cafe.

2732
02:25:04,230 --> 02:25:06,510
It's been a while since we've been there so...

2733
02:25:09,410 --> 02:25:10,490
It's been a minute.

2734
02:25:22,260 --> 02:25:22,740
Oh!

2735
02:25:22,980 --> 02:25:23,740
Where am I?

2736
02:25:33,630 --> 02:25:34,110
Yippee!

2737
02:25:34,750 --> 02:25:36,530
Let me change the music too.

2738
02:25:39,210 --> 02:25:41,130
Now I can check all my notifications.

2739
02:25:42,650 --> 02:25:43,430
Oh wait.

2740
02:25:44,430 --> 02:25:47,090
Wow, I have so many people who added me to their friends list.

2741
02:25:49,690 --> 02:25:50,850
How do I...

2742
02:25:53,970 --> 02:25:55,030
Okay, close.

2743
02:25:58,990 --> 02:26:00,030
One second...

2744
02:26:13,450 --> 02:26:14,270
Where is it?

2745
02:26:15,850 --> 02:26:16,370
Wait.

2746
02:26:21,830 --> 02:26:22,710
One second.

2747
02:26:24,170 --> 02:26:24,810
Here.

2748
02:26:26,610 --> 02:26:28,630
Wait, where did I save it?

2749
02:26:29,810 --> 02:26:30,890
Oh, there.

2750
02:26:38,050 --> 02:26:47,850
Where did I save it?

2751
02:26:48,090 --> 02:26:48,330
Under

2752
02:27:00,830 --> 02:27:05,330
here?

2753
02:27:07,430 --> 02:27:07,910
Where?

2754
02:27:08,570 --> 02:27:10,050
Maybe I didn't move it there.

2755
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:10,910
I just forgot.

2756
02:27:12,550 --> 02:27:13,090
Um...

2757
02:27:14,030 --> 02:27:14,570
Um...

2758
02:27:14,570 --> 02:27:15,590
Um...

2759
02:27:15,590 --> 02:27:16,130
Oh!

2760
02:27:17,830 --> 02:27:18,830
I did.

2761
02:27:19,010 --> 02:27:20,050
I'm so silly.

2762
02:27:20,290 --> 02:27:20,630
Okay.

2763
02:27:34,930 --> 02:27:35,470
Okay!

2764
02:27:39,670 --> 02:27:41,530
Thanks for playing with me, guys.

2765
02:27:42,270 --> 02:27:43,910
This is Empluance2day6.

2766
02:27:45,790 --> 02:27:46,330
I...

2767
02:27:47,290 --> 02:27:48,090
Wanted to play.

2768
02:27:48,090 --> 02:27:49,550
But I played earlier too.

2769
02:27:49,670 --> 02:27:50,610
I played off stream.

2770
02:27:50,810 --> 02:27:52,130
I got to like 167.

2771
02:27:52,490 --> 02:27:53,590
Wow, clown piece!

2772
02:27:54,330 --> 02:27:54,590
Hahaha!

2773
02:27:57,190 --> 02:27:58,350
Really, thank you!

2774
02:27:58,710 --> 02:28:02,230
Watching these pros play is like watching somebody play Lunatic on Toho.

2775
02:28:02,330 --> 02:28:02,950
You're so right.

2776
02:28:03,270 --> 02:28:04,810
My brain can't process it.

2777
02:28:04,850 --> 02:28:05,470
Thanks for all the games.

2778
02:28:05,570 --> 02:28:05,970
Thank you!

2779
02:28:07,410 --> 02:28:10,890
Yeah, we really drew in some crazy players, didn't we?

2780
02:28:11,390 --> 02:28:13,350
Some really good people came in.

2781
02:28:13,390 --> 02:28:13,950
We're like...

2782
02:28:14,590 --> 02:28:16,170
Yeah, I guess I'm gonna...

2783
02:28:16,170 --> 02:28:17,170
I'm gonna...

2784
02:28:17,170 --> 02:28:17,530
I'm gonna...

2785
02:28:17,530 --> 02:28:17,630
I'm gonna...

2786
02:28:17,630 --> 02:28:17,690
I'm gonna...

2787
02:28:18,450 --> 02:28:19,490
I'm gonna dominate in here.

2788
02:28:20,650 --> 02:28:21,970
That's just what happens though.

2789
02:28:23,470 --> 02:28:26,930
That's just what happens, I think.

2790
02:28:27,190 --> 02:28:28,130
This is so fun!

2791
02:28:28,290 --> 02:28:29,410
I hope you guys had fun too.

2792
02:28:30,370 --> 02:28:31,170
Periodically, we'll...

2793
02:28:32,030 --> 02:28:33,630
We'll play some more Tetrio.

2794
02:28:33,930 --> 02:28:36,050
When I feel like getting beat up, you know?

2795
02:28:38,210 --> 02:28:40,890
When I feel like getting beat up, we can play more.

2796
02:28:42,850 --> 02:28:43,830
Let's have fun, yeah?

2797
02:28:43,950 --> 02:28:44,690
Super entertaining.

2798
02:28:45,090 --> 02:28:45,530
I'm glad!

2799
02:28:45,570 --> 02:28:47,490
If you've watched, I hope it was entertaining.

2800
02:28:47,590 --> 02:28:47,670
I'm glad!

2801
02:28:47,670 --> 02:28:49,510
If you played, I hope you had fun.

2802
02:28:51,330 --> 02:28:51,690
Um...

2803
02:28:53,050 --> 02:28:53,690
So, yeah.

2804
02:28:54,650 --> 02:28:56,850
Do a private lobby for Membu sometime?

2805
02:28:57,490 --> 02:28:58,730
I don't know if that's possible.

2806
02:28:58,890 --> 02:28:59,890
I think it is possible.

2807
02:29:00,250 --> 02:29:01,630
That's why they had the...

2808
02:29:02,710 --> 02:29:03,070
The...

2809
02:29:03,070 --> 02:29:03,750
What's the word?

2810
02:29:05,610 --> 02:29:06,870
The code at the top.

2811
02:29:07,650 --> 02:29:08,970
But I just did an open lobby.

2812
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:09,910
Just a public one.

2813
02:29:10,190 --> 02:29:11,190
So, it would be easier.

2814
02:29:11,350 --> 02:29:13,210
But next time, you know, we can probably do like a...

2815
02:29:13,750 --> 02:29:15,310
Or a private one or something.

2816
02:29:17,190 --> 02:29:17,550
Something...

2817
02:29:17,550 --> 02:29:17,650
I don't know.

2818
02:29:17,670 --> 02:29:18,070
Something like that.

2819
02:29:19,110 --> 02:29:21,270
Today, I've learned how vast the ocean is.

2820
02:29:22,810 --> 02:29:23,310
Yeah.

2821
02:29:26,410 --> 02:29:27,550
It's pretty vast.

2822
02:29:30,910 --> 02:29:31,410
Yeah.

2823
02:29:31,810 --> 02:29:33,430
We could do a private lobby someday.

2824
02:29:33,790 --> 02:29:34,290
Sometime.

2825
02:29:34,770 --> 02:29:35,650
How would I do?

2826
02:29:35,710 --> 02:29:38,190
I guess I'll just show the thing on stream, right?

2827
02:29:38,890 --> 02:29:41,610
Is Tetrio usually this popular?

2828
02:29:41,810 --> 02:29:42,250
I don't know.

2829
02:29:43,450 --> 02:29:44,450
I only...

2830
02:29:47,010 --> 02:29:48,010
I only...

2831
02:29:48,610 --> 02:29:49,110
Play...

2832
02:29:49,130 --> 02:29:50,290
I played it when I was teeny tiny.

2833
02:29:50,610 --> 02:29:54,850
If I got a super lobby, if I hit a hundred people, I was like, yeah, wow.

2834
02:29:55,350 --> 02:29:57,350
I can't believe I hit a hundred people.

2835
02:29:59,810 --> 02:30:04,870
So, I remember I only hit like a super lobby a couple of times.

2836
02:30:04,990 --> 02:30:06,150
Very, very rarely.

2837
02:30:06,330 --> 02:30:08,490
So, this is a fun experience.

2838
02:30:14,270 --> 02:30:16,130
It used to be even smaller.

2839
02:30:16,410 --> 02:30:17,010
Oh, my gosh.

2840
02:30:17,010 --> 02:30:17,250
Yeah.

2841
02:30:17,310 --> 02:30:19,110
When I first debuted, back in 2013.

2842
02:30:19,110 --> 02:30:19,250
It's 2020.

2843
02:30:21,510 --> 02:30:23,330
I was a teeny baby.

2844
02:30:28,390 --> 02:30:29,030
But yeah.

2845
02:30:29,190 --> 02:30:29,890
So, it was fine.

2846
02:30:30,190 --> 02:30:32,690
It was fun seeing how crazy people can get.

2847
02:30:33,090 --> 02:30:33,590
And then I...

2848
02:30:33,590 --> 02:30:34,750
I mean, we had some celebrities.

2849
02:30:35,010 --> 02:30:38,950
We had the creator of the site, playing along with us.

2850
02:30:38,970 --> 02:30:39,870
That's so awesome.

2851
02:30:42,510 --> 02:30:43,550
So, yeah.

2852
02:30:43,730 --> 02:30:44,630
It was really great.

2853
02:30:48,190 --> 02:30:49,090
They grow up pretty fast.

2854
02:30:49,090 --> 02:30:49,650
He woke up so fast.

2855
02:30:52,210 --> 02:30:54,710
He wanted to know why the servers were on fire.

2856
02:30:54,890 --> 02:30:55,770
Sorry, Osuke.

2857
02:30:56,130 --> 02:30:58,570
If it caused you any trouble.

2858
02:30:58,790 --> 02:30:59,810
No, I'm sure.

2859
02:31:00,110 --> 02:31:01,190
I'm sure.

2860
02:31:01,990 --> 02:31:03,030
I'm sure.

2861
02:31:05,270 --> 02:31:07,650
They have had more people in a lobby.

2862
02:31:07,830 --> 02:31:09,110
I'm positive of it.

2863
02:31:09,490 --> 02:31:10,410
And people.

2864
02:31:10,550 --> 02:31:14,110
And they have the capacity to handle it.

2865
02:31:15,810 --> 02:31:17,510
I'm sure of it.

2866
02:31:19,310 --> 02:31:19,830
So...

2867
02:31:23,050 --> 02:31:24,550
Just a little bit.

2868
02:31:24,650 --> 02:31:27,150
That trio is so fun because lots of people can join.

2869
02:31:27,750 --> 02:31:28,730
It's really good.

2870
02:31:35,060 --> 02:31:36,880
I should get some rest though.

2871
02:31:36,940 --> 02:31:37,900
For my throat.

2872
02:31:40,780 --> 02:31:41,300
Tomorrow...

2873
02:31:42,140 --> 02:31:43,500
I play Doom 64.

2874
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:50,540
Sunday I play it on stream.

2875
02:31:50,560 --> 02:31:51,420
I don't know what yet.

2876
02:31:53,900 --> 02:31:55,000
Next week?

2877
02:31:55,740 --> 02:31:56,560
Metal Gear?

2878
02:31:56,900 --> 02:31:57,340
Saturday?

2879
02:31:58,660 --> 02:31:59,840
Do you know what time?

2880
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:01,200
For stream tomorrow?

2881
02:32:01,580 --> 02:32:03,140
4 PM EST.

2882
02:32:03,780 --> 02:32:05,020
I might actually... no.

2883
02:32:05,200 --> 02:32:06,580
I might do 5 PM EST.

2884
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:08,980
5 PM EST.

2885
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:12,860
5 PM EST.

2886
02:32:13,060 --> 02:32:15,300
So a little... 2 hours earlier than today.

2887
02:32:17,480 --> 02:32:19,500
Any reason you're doing so many throwbacks?

2888
02:32:22,840 --> 02:32:23,840
I just...

2889
02:32:24,530 --> 02:32:26,200
I played Doom 1 and 2.

2890
02:32:29,100 --> 02:32:29,600
And...

2891
02:32:32,170 --> 02:32:33,250
I don't know.

2892
02:32:33,870 --> 02:32:35,990
I'm not quite ready for Doom 3 yet.

2893
02:32:36,870 --> 02:32:37,710
So I was like...

2894
02:32:37,710 --> 02:32:38,570
I'll play Doom 64.

2895
02:32:42,010 --> 02:32:42,510
And...

2896
02:32:46,690 --> 02:32:49,110
But I do want to play Doom 3.

2897
02:32:50,590 --> 02:32:52,930
I would like to play original Doom 3.

2898
02:32:54,370 --> 02:32:55,210
Because it's...

2899
02:32:55,210 --> 02:32:56,730
Because I want to play with...

2900
02:32:57,430 --> 02:32:58,150
It's like...

2901
02:32:58,150 --> 02:32:59,930
You either have your flash...

2902
02:32:59,930 --> 02:33:02,770
The lights are off and you either have your flashlight out.

2903
02:33:02,910 --> 02:33:04,050
Or you have your gun out.

2904
02:33:05,990 --> 02:33:07,270
So it's actually...

2905
02:33:07,270 --> 02:33:08,430
A horror game.

2906
02:33:09,130 --> 02:33:09,850
But I don't know.

2907
02:33:09,890 --> 02:33:11,190
I just felt like going back to Doom.

2908
02:33:12,270 --> 02:33:13,450
Just because... I don't know.

2909
02:33:17,350 --> 02:33:18,710
Doom 3 is one of my favorites.

2910
02:33:18,850 --> 02:33:19,350
Haters welcome.

2911
02:33:20,930 --> 02:33:22,250
And then...

2912
02:33:22,250 --> 02:33:22,810
Maybe...

2913
02:33:22,810 --> 02:33:24,390
I think maybe because...

2914
02:33:26,270 --> 02:33:26,930
Because...

2915
02:33:28,690 --> 02:33:31,070
The new Doom trailer...

2916
02:33:31,070 --> 02:33:32,110
Kind of inspired me.

2917
02:33:32,370 --> 02:33:33,990
I'll play up to...

2918
02:33:33,990 --> 02:33:35,730
Doom 2016.

2919
02:33:36,850 --> 02:33:38,810
And then the new Doom...

2920
02:33:38,810 --> 02:33:41,150
Did it have a release date?

2921
02:33:41,550 --> 02:33:42,350
What was it called?

2922
02:33:42,530 --> 02:33:43,190
Doom...

2923
02:33:45,290 --> 02:33:46,090
Oh yeah.

2924
02:33:46,150 --> 02:33:47,050
And then there's Doom Eternal.

2925
02:33:48,390 --> 02:33:49,050
And...

2926
02:33:50,850 --> 02:33:51,430
Wait.

2927
02:33:51,490 --> 02:33:52,410
Or is that Doom 2016?

2928
02:33:52,690 --> 02:33:52,910
Wait.

2929
02:33:52,930 --> 02:33:53,290
Am I stupid?

2930
02:33:53,690 --> 02:33:54,530
Forget Doom.

2931
02:33:54,570 --> 02:33:55,550
Embrace DOOM.

2932
02:33:57,210 --> 02:33:58,350
The Dark Age.

2933
02:33:58,390 --> 02:33:58,790
Thank you.

2934
02:34:00,170 --> 02:34:01,090
Dark Ages.

2935
02:34:01,590 --> 02:34:03,210
Dark Ages release date.

2936
02:34:04,450 --> 02:34:05,250
Sometime in...

2937
02:34:05,250 --> 02:34:06,130
2025.

2938
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:07,410
Oh.

2939
02:34:07,470 --> 02:34:08,070
So we have...

2940
02:34:08,070 --> 02:34:09,370
Quite some time.

2941
02:34:11,110 --> 02:34:12,530
I'm wondering if...

2942
02:34:12,530 --> 02:34:14,370
Metal Gear is going to get delayed.

2943
02:34:14,970 --> 02:34:17,410
Because they haven't put up a...

2944
02:34:17,410 --> 02:34:17,890
A...

2945
02:34:23,210 --> 02:34:24,410
Release date.

2946
02:34:24,550 --> 02:34:25,210
I wonder.

2947
02:34:26,890 --> 02:34:28,650
If maybe it'll be...

2948
02:34:29,750 --> 02:34:30,350
Delayed.

2949
02:34:30,350 --> 02:34:31,710
To like early next year.

2950
02:34:32,070 --> 02:34:32,670
Hmm.

2951
02:34:35,270 --> 02:34:37,610
I mean someone put up a date for it.

2952
02:34:37,750 --> 02:34:39,030
You mean the GameStop one?

2953
02:34:39,170 --> 02:34:41,430
But they already clarified that was a...

2954
02:34:42,350 --> 02:34:43,270
A mistake.

2955
02:34:44,790 --> 02:34:46,930
My favorite about Doom is the music.

2956
02:34:46,970 --> 02:34:47,410
Yeah.

2957
02:34:47,410 --> 02:34:47,890
Right.

2958
02:34:47,990 --> 02:34:48,510
So awesome.

2959
02:34:48,870 --> 02:34:49,330
I like the music.

2960
02:34:50,910 --> 02:34:53,110
I need more time to perfect the pee pee filter.

2961
02:34:53,390 --> 02:34:53,790
Yeah.

2962
02:34:54,590 --> 02:34:55,270
I'm not...

2963
02:34:55,270 --> 02:34:56,030
Rushing it though.

2964
02:34:56,150 --> 02:34:56,710
I'm like yeah.

2965
02:34:57,170 --> 02:34:58,710
I'll wait for however long.

2966
02:34:59,270 --> 02:35:00,750
I just can't wait to play it.

2967
02:35:03,170 --> 02:35:05,250
There's going to be so many more people getting it.

2968
02:35:05,310 --> 02:35:07,510
I mean already with the Master Collection.

2969
02:35:08,150 --> 02:35:09,250
So many more people...

2970
02:35:09,250 --> 02:35:10,310
Have been getting into Metal Gear.

2971
02:35:10,650 --> 02:35:13,410
I just hope that they can announce the Volume 2.

2972
02:35:14,170 --> 02:35:15,450
And I know it's...

2973
02:35:15,450 --> 02:35:16,670
I know it's...

2974
02:35:17,170 --> 02:35:18,950
Not confirmed or...

2975
02:35:19,350 --> 02:35:20,350
Probably a pipe dream.

2976
02:35:20,550 --> 02:35:22,830
But I really hope that they can find a way to...

2977
02:35:23,130 --> 02:35:25,170
Get Metal Gear Solid 4 on there.

2978
02:35:26,910 --> 02:35:27,470
Hmm.

2979
02:35:33,800 --> 02:35:36,200
I wonder who's making the music for Dark Ages.

2980
02:35:36,720 --> 02:35:37,600
I don't know.

2981
02:35:38,340 --> 02:35:40,220
Oh I thought about playing Quake 2.

2982
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:42,780
Well not Quake...

2983
02:35:42,780 --> 02:35:44,320
2 but like...

2984
02:35:44,320 --> 02:35:45,440
Quake as well.

2985
02:35:46,580 --> 02:35:48,940
Never played MGS4 because no PS3.

2986
02:35:49,060 --> 02:35:50,180
I know that's why I went...

2987
02:35:50,720 --> 02:35:51,200
So many people.

2988
02:35:51,400 --> 02:35:53,780
Like that is the game that...

2989
02:35:55,080 --> 02:35:55,600
That...

2990
02:35:56,720 --> 02:35:57,780
Needs it the most.

2991
02:36:00,560 --> 02:36:02,700
I was really happy when the...

2992
02:36:02,700 --> 02:36:04,280
Master Collection came out though.

2993
02:36:04,360 --> 02:36:05,120
Because I was like...

2994
02:36:05,120 --> 02:36:07,100
Oh my gosh finally more people can at least...

2995
02:36:07,100 --> 02:36:08,460
Play the games.

2996
02:36:09,800 --> 02:36:11,740
Like when they announced it I was like...

2997
02:36:11,740 --> 02:36:12,040
Yes!

2998
02:36:12,540 --> 02:36:15,280
It can finally be played more easily.

2999
02:36:16,940 --> 02:36:17,580
Um...

3000
02:36:17,580 --> 02:36:19,720
So I was really happy about that.

3001
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:21,140
Uh...

3002
02:36:21,140 --> 02:36:21,920
But...

3003
02:36:23,380 --> 02:36:24,020
2...

3004
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:26,560
Pirate 5...

3005
02:36:28,900 --> 02:36:29,540
5...

3006
02:36:32,070 --> 02:36:32,710
5...

3007
02:36:34,290 --> 02:36:35,510
Unrelated to anything...

3008
02:36:35,510 --> 02:36:36,510
But today Nasser restored...

3009
02:36:36,510 --> 02:36:37,910
Full connection to Voyager 1.

3010
02:36:38,530 --> 02:36:40,650
That thing is 46 years old...

3011
02:36:40,650 --> 02:36:43,090
And 24 billion kilometers away from Earth.

3012
02:36:43,310 --> 02:36:44,750
I think it's pretty cool.

3013
02:36:45,090 --> 02:36:45,710
What?

3014
02:36:56,260 --> 02:36:57,380
What the...?

3015
02:36:59,260 --> 02:36:59,820
What the...?

3016
02:36:59,820 --> 02:37:01,940
How is the battery lasted for so long?

3017
02:37:03,080 --> 02:37:03,720
How is the battery lasted for so long?

3018
02:37:03,960 --> 02:37:04,520
Magprobe...

3019
02:37:05,860 --> 02:37:06,780
That was crazy.

3020
02:37:10,800 --> 02:37:12,580
You weren't here but for some reason...

3021
02:37:12,580 --> 02:37:15,420
I could hear you get really excited when the MGS stuff was announced.

3022
02:37:15,720 --> 02:37:15,800
I could hear you get really excited when the MGS stuff was announced.

3023
02:37:15,800 --> 02:37:17,460
What like the Delta trailer and stuff?

3024
02:37:20,160 --> 02:37:20,720
Yeah...

3025
02:37:26,320 --> 02:37:27,400
Space magic.

3026
02:37:28,400 --> 02:37:30,580
It uses nuclear decay for power.

3027
02:37:30,740 --> 02:37:31,400
Oh wait, actually?

3028
02:37:32,880 --> 02:37:36,240
Oh, solar panels make sense, but...

3029
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:37,300
What?

3030
02:37:37,560 --> 02:37:40,020
What has it... what has it seen?

3031
02:37:41,480 --> 02:37:45,620
Oh my gosh, Google has like an interactive diagram of the Voyager.

3032
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:46,240
That's so cool.

3033
02:37:47,320 --> 02:37:48,740
Wow, I can zoom in.

3034
02:37:48,820 --> 02:37:50,220
What's the golden record?

3035
02:37:51,860 --> 02:37:52,380
Oh.

3036
02:37:52,380 --> 02:37:58,960
Carries a phonograph containing sounds and images that would communicate details of life on Earth to extraterrestrials.

3037
02:37:59,160 --> 02:37:59,680
What?

3038
02:37:59,820 --> 02:38:00,520
That's so cool.

3039
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:10,000
If you ever play Ace Combat 7, would it be okay for me to teach you how to post-stall maneuver?

3040
02:38:10,360 --> 02:38:11,500
AKA Top Gun movie.

3041
02:38:11,660 --> 02:38:11,940
Yes!

3042
02:38:12,520 --> 02:38:14,140
I didn't watch Top Gun.

3043
02:38:15,860 --> 02:38:18,400
I didn't watch Top Gun on my last trip.

3044
02:38:18,440 --> 02:38:19,540
I was too sleepy.

3045
02:38:19,540 --> 02:38:21,260
I eeped the whole time.

3046
02:38:21,320 --> 02:38:22,420
I didn't watch a single movie.

3047
02:38:22,600 --> 02:38:24,500
Which is extremely rare for me.

3048
02:38:26,880 --> 02:38:30,620
Wow, generators powered by plutonium-238 radiation.

3049
02:38:31,260 --> 02:38:32,000
Oh, there it is.

3050
02:38:37,780 --> 02:38:42,980
How does it... how do they... how do they have the means of communicating with it?

3051
02:38:43,300 --> 02:38:45,780
Radio dish antenna for communication with Earth.

3052
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:49,420
But like, how does the radio signals... how do they go so far?

3053
02:38:51,580 --> 02:38:52,380
Imaging science.

3054
02:38:52,580 --> 02:38:53,920
I wanna know what it's seeing.

3055
02:38:54,140 --> 02:38:55,500
What is it seeing right now?

3056
02:38:55,740 --> 02:38:56,920
So far away.

3057
02:39:02,870 --> 02:39:04,930
They shouted it really loud.

3058
02:39:06,890 --> 02:39:08,150
Hella good reception.

3059
02:39:08,570 --> 02:39:13,750
But if I go into the mountains, I get... I get no reception.

3060
02:39:14,390 --> 02:39:15,690
What's up with this?

3061
02:39:15,870 --> 02:39:16,390
Huh?

3062
02:39:16,990 --> 02:39:23,290
How are we able to communicate with a satellite that is 24 billion kilometers away from Earth?

3063
02:39:23,530 --> 02:39:26,890
But if I go into a grocery store, I lose all connection.

3064
02:39:30,650 --> 02:39:31,930
Hey, now.

3065
02:39:35,650 --> 02:39:37,370
This is so messed up.

3066
02:39:43,300 --> 02:39:44,960
No mountains in space.

3067
02:39:53,630 --> 02:40:01,290
You're telling me that not even like the bajillion of meteors that are in space is stopping... you know, are getting in the way?

3068
02:40:02,510 --> 02:40:04,090
I doubt that.

3069
02:40:04,270 --> 02:40:06,310
For some reason I doubt that.

3070
02:40:08,830 --> 02:40:09,970
No ceilings either.

3071
02:40:12,470 --> 02:40:14,050
No ceilings in space.

3072
02:40:14,150 --> 02:40:15,990
Just vast, vast emptiness.

3073
02:40:19,010 --> 02:40:20,710
Space is really empty.

3074
02:40:21,850 --> 02:40:23,990
Well, we should all just pack up and move there.

3075
02:40:25,350 --> 02:40:26,690
Let's all move to space.

3076
02:40:27,710 --> 02:40:31,650
This is me trying to get signal in some of the rooms at Ofgai.

3077
02:40:34,290 --> 02:40:35,090
That's true.

3078
02:40:36,670 --> 02:40:40,830
I used to think malls installed signal jammers to stop people from having connections.

3079
02:40:41,510 --> 02:40:43,870
To instead pay for malls' Wi-Fi.

3080
02:40:43,950 --> 02:40:46,090
Did your mall have Wi-Fi you had to pay for?

3081
02:40:46,350 --> 02:40:47,990
But no, I kind of believe that.

3082
02:40:48,090 --> 02:40:56,150
Because I feel like sometimes grocery stores do stuff like that so that you can't compare prices and go buy it on Amazon.

3083
02:40:57,810 --> 02:41:06,010
I feel... I feel like maybe they purposefully build themselves with super concrete or something.

3084
02:41:07,150 --> 02:41:09,950
Hopefully I'm able to get them made in time for AX, but...

3085
02:41:10,590 --> 02:41:13,910
Minto unit slash morale patches are in the works!

3086
02:41:15,630 --> 02:41:16,230
What?!

3087
02:41:16,230 --> 02:41:18,210
Maple are on a patch?!

3088
02:41:18,210 --> 02:41:19,170
Wait, I wanna see!

3089
02:41:21,910 --> 02:41:25,110
Do you have a preview that you can post to Twitter?

3090
02:41:32,710 --> 02:41:33,830
Do you have a preview?

3091
02:41:41,010 --> 02:41:41,570
Oh.

3092
02:41:41,570 --> 02:41:42,730
What do you mean, oh?

3093
02:41:45,570 --> 02:41:46,510
Oh, oh.

3094
02:41:46,990 --> 02:41:47,550
Oh.

3095
02:41:51,770 --> 02:41:53,490
I'm checking my hashtag.

3096
02:41:57,860 --> 02:41:58,880
Chat summary.

3097
02:41:59,380 --> 02:42:04,040
The viewers are responding to the streamer's remarks about a popular character named Freak Phantom.

3098
02:42:06,400 --> 02:42:13,560
The majority of the conversation revolves around jokes related to the streamer's mispronunciation of the character's name.

3099
02:42:14,660 --> 02:42:17,240
This is so messed up.

3100
02:42:20,740 --> 02:42:21,420
Summary.

3101
02:42:21,520 --> 02:42:27,020
This is a Twitch live stream chat where viewers are watching a streamer play the video game Fall Guys.

3102
02:42:28,760 --> 02:42:32,720
Viewers are making comments about the streamer's gameplay, the music, and the game itself.

3103
02:42:32,980 --> 02:42:35,720
I wasn't playing Fall Guys.

3104
02:42:38,010 --> 02:42:40,950
Oh yeah, it was my first game I got 69th.

3105
02:42:41,730 --> 02:42:44,030
Yes, ask us about Freak Phantom.

3106
02:42:46,510 --> 02:43:02,130
The chat is about a Tetris 99 game where Mint, quote unquote, dominates the other players ruthlessly and quickly, earning many reactions from viewers such as admiration, amusement, and astonishment at the player's skill.

3107
02:43:03,030 --> 02:43:03,670
Yippee!

3108
02:43:04,970 --> 02:43:07,470
I'm going through the Minto Live tag right now.

3109
02:43:08,110 --> 02:43:14,450
The chat is filled with excitement and joy as the streamer affectionately referred to as the Ghost Lady.

3110
02:43:17,190 --> 02:43:20,190
Interacts with her viewers and expresses her love for them.

3111
02:43:20,430 --> 02:43:29,170
Fans celebrate the streamer's acknowledgement and share their positive reactions, expressing their happiness and gratitude for being loved by her.

3112
02:43:35,300 --> 02:43:38,800
Now everybody be great... be... be...

3113
02:43:38,800 --> 02:43:40,520
be gratitude.

3114
02:43:41,460 --> 02:43:45,440
Express your gratitude as I show my love for you.

3115
02:43:46,680 --> 02:43:50,500
Be... be thankful that I am loving you.

3116
02:43:51,880 --> 02:43:57,560
Loving you is easy cause you're beautiful.

3117
02:44:00,420 --> 02:44:02,620
I'm not gonna say the next part!

3118
02:44:03,460 --> 02:44:06,260
Because that's not what we're gonna do.

3119
02:44:10,420 --> 02:44:11,980
Thank you, Kami-sama.

3120
02:44:13,400 --> 02:44:14,900
Just post it on the tag.

3121
02:44:16,300 --> 02:44:17,200
Hi, Mint.

3122
02:44:24,440 --> 02:44:25,420
Oh my gosh!

3123
02:44:25,840 --> 02:44:26,520
Carnival!

3124
02:44:26,520 --> 02:44:27,680
Thank you so much!

3125
02:44:29,080 --> 02:44:29,560
Gratitude.

3126
02:44:31,820 --> 02:44:32,960
Can't hit the high note?

3127
02:44:33,100 --> 02:44:33,600
Not right now.

3128
02:44:55,770 --> 02:44:57,650
You're the best Ghost Lady.

3129
02:44:59,850 --> 02:45:01,710
I should go take my medicine.

3130
02:45:02,110 --> 02:45:03,750
Everybody go take your medicine, okay?

3131
02:45:04,890 --> 02:45:06,270
I'm gonna go...

3132
02:45:07,810 --> 02:45:08,970
I'm gonna go...

3133
02:45:08,970 --> 02:45:15,330
I'm gonna go rest my throat and rest my brain from the butt wiping that I got done today.

3134
02:45:15,510 --> 02:45:16,810
Holy moly.

3135
02:45:18,050 --> 02:45:22,470
But I'll see you guys tomorrow and we'll have a grand old time.

3136
02:45:23,610 --> 02:45:24,210
Otsumita!

3137
02:45:24,930 --> 02:45:25,530
Otsumita!

3138
02:45:25,670 --> 02:45:26,350
I'm just gonna go.

3139
02:45:26,450 --> 02:45:28,010
I'm gonna go take my meds.

3140
02:45:28,690 --> 02:45:29,530
Okie dokie.

3141
02:45:29,770 --> 02:45:32,210
My head kinda hurts.

3142
02:45:32,330 --> 02:45:32,830
Go lay down!

3143
02:45:33,130 --> 02:45:33,750
Have a good night.

3144
02:45:33,770 --> 02:45:36,210
We'll have fun this weekend, baby.

3145
02:45:36,970 --> 02:45:38,050
And yeah.

3146
02:45:38,130 --> 02:45:39,090
Get lots of rest.

3147
02:45:39,350 --> 02:45:41,170
After the week is over!

3148
02:45:42,010 --> 02:45:42,370
Yippee!

3149
02:45:43,570 --> 02:45:45,530
Yippee, yippee, yippee, yippee, yippee.

3150
02:45:46,130 --> 02:45:48,090
Yippee, yippee, yippee, yippee, yippee.

3151
02:45:48,710 --> 02:45:50,170
Yippee, yippee, yippee, yippee, yippee.

3152
02:45:51,090 --> 02:45:51,630
Otsumita!

3153
02:45:52,070 --> 02:45:52,850
Bye bye!

3154
02:45:54,430 --> 02:45:54,870
Thanks for watching!

3155
02:45:55,110 --> 02:45:55,530
Thank you!

3156
02:45:56,590 --> 02:45:57,630
Bye bye!
