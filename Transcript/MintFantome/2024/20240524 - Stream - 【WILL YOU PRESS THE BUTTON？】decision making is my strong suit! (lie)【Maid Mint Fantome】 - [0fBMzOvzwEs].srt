00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,900
The button has been pressed zero times.

18
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,860
No exercise, chubby mint.

19
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,220
No!

20
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,180
I exercise.

21
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,860
I exercise.

22
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,320
What are you talking about?

23
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,240
Get a functional rex, but snake comes to destroy.

24
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,400
Sounds awesome, actually, if snake shows up at all.

25
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,860
Win for me, baby.

26
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,400

exercise.

27
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,120
Chubby mint you say.

28
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,060
Shut up.

29
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,520
All you degenerates, right now.

30
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,180
We're going to the Chubby Maid Cafe.

31
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,300
Stop it!

32
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,180
Hush, hush, hush, hush.

33
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,600
You guys are unbelievable.

34
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,820
You hear the C word and you're just like, Chubby?

35
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,380
Chubby?

36
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,360
Chubby?

37
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,020
Stummy?

38
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:49,780
Stummy?

39
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,400
Thighs?

40
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,420
Big, big, big boobs?

41
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,360
That's how really I know where I was going.

42
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,940
Neuron activated.

43
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,000
Anyway, what did I walk into?

44
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,900
Don't worry, please, man, I just woke up.

45
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,220
Good morning!

46
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,480
I don't even know.

47
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,420
I'm still tired, too.

48
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,400
I woke up and immediately...

49
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,260
Immediately, Matara and I recorded.

50
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,020
So I'm quite sleeping myself, actually.

51
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,880
And I have some stuff I need to do today.

52
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,740
So sorry.

53
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:53,620
So I have an early stream today.

54
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,280
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

55
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,860
Kelly, welcome back.

56
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,720
Name sword, welcome back.

57
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,420
Gerard, welcome back.

58
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,340
Zemplex, welcome back.

59
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,020
Amy, welcome back.

60
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,400
Thank you, guys.

61
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,060
Eepy, eepy.

62
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,540
I know, I'm so eepy lately.

63
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,160
Recently, I got a...

64
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,940
My cats like to wake me up very early to eat.

65
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:24,340
I recently got a food bowl that will like open up at 2 a.m.

66
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,800
So that they will stop waking me up.

67
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,320
Because my one cat like scratches the door and it's just the
most annoying thing ever.

68
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,980
Textarian, welcome back.

69
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,300
Jeremy, welcome back.

70
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,580
I've also pressed a button.

71
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,800
Derp, so welcome back.

72
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,120
Adashi, welcome back.

73
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,100
Today we're pressing buttons.

74
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,460
You guys push my buttons.

75
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,920
Okay, so this is a game.

76
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,520
It is a moral dilemma.

77
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,820
It is life or death.

78
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,720
Or in my case, death or death.

79
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:09,800
Where with, you give up, you are given something good, but
it comes at a price.

80
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,160
The monkey paw curls.

81
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:26,080
And so, despite that, that little, that little finger, will
you still push the button will you be approaching these

82
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,340
questions as made mint with made mint brain or as made mint
with a 12 year old gamer lad

83
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:50,540
brain I think today we can have a we can have a theme I
would like to maybe every We can only push the button if

84
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,520
it...

85
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,860
If, uh...

86
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,420
Hmm, what should the condition be?

87
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,660
We can only push the button...

88
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,050
If...

89
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,930
Press em the button...

90
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,270
Button em...

91
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,830
I don't know.

92
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,710
We'll come up with it as it goes.

93
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:25,430
Sorry.

94
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,690
My brain is not working today.

95
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,790
Press it for Hanya.

96
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:43,110
so let's start with our first one because this one seems
pretty whatever I opened a website and this is what it said

97
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:52,250
well you press the button you master every co-op multiplayer
local game ever made that's like a lot of games is this the

98
00:09:52,250 --> 00:10:04,530
button am I pushing it wrong button ni hongo mo push the red
button shiny and red.

99
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,430
I agree.

100
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,590
But every word you type ends with an...

101
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,630
Mmm.

102
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,290
Mmm.

103
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,070
Um.

104
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,010
Mmm.

105
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,690
So, what is the...

106
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,670
What's bad about that?

107
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,670
Is it just annoying?

108
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:21,830
Every word?

109
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,410
So, it's like...

110
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,090
It's like that SpongeBob episode.

111
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,430
Is that... Wait, hold on.

112
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,910
I have to lean in.

113
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,310
Hold on.

114
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,370
Is that M or RN?

115
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,820
It's RN I thought it was an M Oh my god

116
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:55,280
I thought it was an M Oh my god Saku Thank you for the Aqua
Supra I got my bonus today So it is time to spoil the minto

117
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:02,960
for all the fun times so far Stop Play a straight poopy paws
and Butaro Why do you write Butaro like that?

118
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,380
Extra pets.

119
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,800
It's boo, like, boo.

120
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,640
Minto needs glasses?

121
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,740
Oh, I have my old contacts in today.

122
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,680
Also, wasn't there an Akasupa?

123
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,500
Go, sure.

124
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,740
Your Akasupa before stream, I saw it.

125
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,220
I saw it, thank you.

126
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:29,420
So it's like, okay, so it's like that SpongeBob episode
where it's like, I don't understand what you're saying.

127
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,940
Like that, right?

128
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:41,160
I don't understand but instead it's

129
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:52,300
Babycore things are the five gifted except but like what's
what's so bad about this I would be amazing at games people

130
00:11:52,300 --> 00:12:00,720
would just think I'm annoying what's what's any different
than now I would be the best there is to ever be but it's

131
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,220
like also it's you master every co-op multiplayer game ever
made.

132
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:12,080
Like, that's also, that's also, like, why don't you just say
every game?

133
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,720
Why don't you just say every game ever made?

134
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:28,040
But also, I don't know, part of me is like, part of me is
like, then you have no challenge to get better at games.

135
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,480
It's games made today, not games made in the future.

136
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,540
No one says ever.

137
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,160
Oh, wait.

138
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,080
Ever made ever?

139
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,900
Ever made from win.

140
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,280
No?

141
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,900
Yeah, learning is fun.

142
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,460
But the money.

143
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:44,820
What?

144
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,540
Because I would be like a pro gamer?

145
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,140
People would definitely think I was cheating.

146
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,940
Tis himself.

147
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,020
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

148
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,420
I guess not single player games.

149
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,040
Oh.

150
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,480
Oh, that's what they mean by local games then.

151
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:10,260
Ah, oh my god, I would be God at Mario Party.

152
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,660
I would be God at Mario Kart.

153
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,320
Local includes single probably.

154
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,100
That's what I was thinking, though, with the local.

155
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,260
But I guess if it means, like, local multiplayer, I don't
know, actually.

156
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,620
It would be an apex legend.

157
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,540
an Apex Legend.

158
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,700
I'm already an Apex Legend.

159
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,300
I don't know if you guys know that or anything.

160
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,380
You could speedrun Metal Gear.

161
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,760
I don't think I could ever speedrun Metal Gear.

162
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,100
Because...

163
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,320
Because...

164
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,560
The only way I would speedrun Metal Gear is if I...

165
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,140
Is if I am given...

166
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,500
If I can watch the cutscenes.

167
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,280
Because I cannot...

168
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,620
I physically cannot skip cutscenes.

169
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,040
I just love watching them so much.

170
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:23,580
Minto new Apex legend confirmed Yeah Dumb Got this stream

180
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,380
Not yet.

181
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,580
Just wait.

182
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,800
until I get back when we start our Metal Gear Solid journey.

183
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,400
Oh, oh, oh!

184
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

185
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,740
Stop reading my typos.

186
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,380
Can't wait for the MGS4 watch along.

187
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,100
Yippee!

188
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,380
No one can spell today.

189
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,480
Yippee!

190
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,680
Is the MGS4 locked behind the PS4?

191
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,900
Uh, no, PS3.

192
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,320
I have my PS3 for it.

193
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,320
Yes.

194
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,080
I have it.

195
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:47,580
I have it.

196
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,500
I have it all set up.

197
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,700
I could play it right now if I would...

198
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:50,880
Actually, no.

199
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,800
Because I would have to set up.

200
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,640
I would have to set up everything.

201
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,320
But I could do it today if I even wanted to.

202
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,280
I could.

203
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,460
But then I would cry.

204
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,940
Because it's MGS4.

205
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:00,700
Anyway.

206
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,640
You know what?

207
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,340
I don't care.

208
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:13,100
I'm gonna assume that local games is like local, you know,
like, it's multiplayer, but it's not online multiplayer.

209
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,780
I'm not gonna assume that it's, that it's single player
games.

210
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,900
I'm going to push the button, because who cares if everybody
just hears me go,

211
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:41,620
Every word ends with, so it's like, hey, you, um, you, um,
Get goodem, wait, getem, getem, getem, addem, the, giveem,

212
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:56,360
oh, it's our end, shoot, it's our end, hold on, uh, uh,
getem, getern, goodern, addern, learn, gamer, oh my gosh, it

213
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:08,260
would piss people off even more, oh my god, it would make
people so angry, Because they would be bad and then they

214
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,660
would also see me typing so annoyingly.

215
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,560
Oh my god.

216
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,640
GERM, GERM, GERM, GERM, GERM.

217
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,520
Cominta!

218
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,480
Vashami!

219
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,420
Cominta!

220
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,000
What?

221
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:24,540
What?

222
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,140
What?

223
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:26,540
Is it...

224
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,700
Is it too...

225
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,760
Is it still?

226
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,160
Still?

227
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:29,480
No.

228
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,060
Oh my gosh, it would be just like a plane.

229
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,840
Time to change all your passwords.

230
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,100
Oh my gosh, that would be so bad.

231
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:52,480
If my password leaked, you would know exactly what the last
two letters of my password will be.

232
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,760
Hurner, metal, metaler, gearer.

233
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,080
Gator, non-earn, my-earn.

234
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,020
It feels like I'm reading Lulite's speak or something.

235
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,080
It's so bad.

236
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,900
Oh, how mean to home.

237
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,480
Hello, Maya.

238
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,160
Oh, my gosh.

239
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:14,520
Wait.

240
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,680
But also.

241
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,360
But also.

242
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,900
You guys, I would have to make every tweet a voice tweet.

243
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,460
Because nobody would want to read my tweets anymore.

244
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,740
Because every word that I would type would end in R.

245
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,040
And oh, my gosh.

246
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:42,080
wait does this include like business emails and stuff okay
they would just think i'm really into the character you know

247
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:58,320
they'd be like nobody would want to nobody it's career
suicide but it doesn't matter all i have to do is speak it's

251
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,840

252
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,700
I would not.

253
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,580
What's wrong with you guys?

254
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,280
Let's try the next one.

255
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

256
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:54,480
wait.

257
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,580
Um, um, um.

258
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,460
How is this an issue for me?

259
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:12,800
Also, if there are only gay girls on the earth, that would
include everybody, though, right?

260
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,200
If it's only...

261
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,040
Then everybody is a gay girl.

262
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,380
Everybody is girl.

263
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,340
Right?

264
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,200
Right?

265
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,380
Yeah, it includes you.

266
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,700
It includes you, the viewer.

267
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,920
I'm pressing to see under girls' dresses.

268
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,100
Hallelujah.

269
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:34,980
What?

270
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,500
Why did you not press the button?

271
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,800
It's a win-win.

272
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,440
everybody girls girls rule the world

273
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:59,040
let's see will you press the button you get a million
dollars but you have to spend one night 9 p.m to 6 a.m in a

274
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:06,080
sentient walmart that's trying to kill you the entire time
you can't bring in weapons but you can use any weapons or

275
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,800
objects you find in the store well luckily it's a walmart so
um there's already guns in the

276
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,700
what are you talking about it's not even 20 minutes what do
you mean what do you mean

277
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:44,700
for a million dollars though for a million dollars hmm and
what 9 p.m to 6 a.m how long is that 9 to 10 10 11 12 wait 9

278
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,460

to 6.

279
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,560
9 hours?

280
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,800
9 hours for a million dollars?

281
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,840
I mean, a million...

282
00:21:59,220 --> 00:21:59,840
Undaxed, right?

283
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,340
A million dollars doesn't really get you that...

284
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,940
I mean, it's a lot, don't get me wrong, but like...

285
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,360
Hmm.

286
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,900
It's not like what it used to be, you know?

287
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,820
It's not like what it used to be.

288
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,800
Oh, I didn't update the button counter, you're right, thank
you.

289
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,020
you.

290
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,240
I've pressed the button two times already.

291
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,060
Dang.

292
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:20,760
Oh, nope.

293
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,430
You'd still have to pay taxes on this?

294
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,050
And it's like risking my life.

295
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,820
What's the most dangerous thing in Walmart?

296
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:42,700
Walmart?

297
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,340
I absolutely would, no question.

298
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,660
But best case, get eaten by a sentient Walmart.

299
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,660
Worst case, I get a million dollars.

300
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,000
It says it's trying to kill you, but they didn't say.

301
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,620
They didn't say how you would die.

302
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,920
Because what if it is, I mean, if it's like...

303
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,660
Oh my gosh, wait.

304
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,440
What if the Walmart is like a monster girl?

305
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,540
Oh my god, wait.

306
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,200
Can I Riz the Walmart?

307
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:15,900
Wait.

308
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,240
If it's like a, you know, it's like a...

309
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:27,280
It's like a monster girl who's like trying to, trying to,
you know, wait, actually cooking.

310
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,000
Romance route?

311
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,740
Yeah, let her cook, yeah.

312
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,780
Like monster house?

313
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,660
Oh my god.

314
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,840
Like, you've seen those, like, where there's like, it's
like, it looks like, you know, something unassuming, but

315
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,960
it's actually a monster girl.

316
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,360
You're awesome.

317
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,900
Thanks for the super time.

318
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,300
Thank you for the don't know.

319
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:05,900
As a Canadian, I wouldn't have to pay taxes on the million,
but also as a Canadian, there would be no guns in the

320
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,340
Walmart.

321
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,180
True, true, true.

322
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,460
It's a girl house.

323
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,460
Hmm.

324
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:20,860
Hmm.

325
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,520
I mean, sentient Walmart.

326
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,040
And also, like, how is it trying to kill me?

327
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,900
Like, what's it doing?

328
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,520
Like, what?

329
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,260
If I try to step outside, it closes the door on my foot?

330
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,520
Like, it doesn't really make much sense, I feel.

331
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,820
Like, it feels kind of like...

332
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,120
What?

333
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,700
Do they control everything inside the Walmart?

334
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,620
How can a Walmart kill you if you're already dead?

335
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,060
We're under the assumption that I'm alive, okay?

336
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,040
Which is really weird to think about, but...

337
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,060
Walmart's is dress.

338
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,900
Oh, I'm just kidding.

339
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,060
Raiders.

340
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,600
Oh, I don't see.

341
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,480
I don't see.

342
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,180
I don't see.

343
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,960
Who raided me, but thank you.

344
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,280
I think my pinned comment is blocking.

345
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,440
Sorry.

346
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,840
Yabe, I'm taking off your pinned comment.

347
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,760
I really liked it, though.

348
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,980
Robo, thanks for the vibe gifted.

349
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,540
Okay.

350
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:34,240
I think this one is kind of well okay what if it's not a
monster girl I will not push the button I think this one's

351
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,300
kind of whatever

367
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,790
Giving her the ReZero experience.

368
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,930
You guys have a lot of opinions on this one.

369
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:40,790
Holy cow.

370
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,490
It's useful though.

371
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,910
I'd say it's more useful.

372
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:45,530
Think of food.

373
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,130
Eat food.

374
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,570
Foods goes away after you're done.

375
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:49,650
No getting fat.

376
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,770
So if I just think of food.

377
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,530
Create con ticket, airplane ticket, money, etc.

378
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,690
So you use the money.

379
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,230
Oh my gosh.

380
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,410
Wait, you use the money.

381
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:13,470
money you use the money and then you then you then you pay
for the thing and then it disappears it's it's oh my gosh

382
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,470
it's foolproof it's robbery it's highway robbery

383
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:26,870
in a world where there is a ghost maid that is minty with a
weird obsession of metal gear

384
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:36,710
thanks she's called mid mid chat Kimani, we'll come back,
thank you.

385
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,550
Create a cold fusion reactor, study the design file patent.

386
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,810
And what is a cold fusion reactor?

387
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,130
No, I'm scared.

388
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,370
What are you trying to create?

389
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,550
You can also create a disappearing murder weapon.

390
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,210
You know, I thought of that also, too.

391
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,650
This is like the perfect way to commit a crime.

392
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,610
It does, it definitely...

393
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:08,170
This definitely feels like it has more uses than not uses,
right?

394
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,270
But also, isn't it that...

395
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,130
Oh, it's infinite energy.

396
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,170
Oh, but isn't it energy can't be created or destroyed?

397
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:25,770
So if you create something, and it's destroyed within 10
minutes, where is it going?

398
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,110
Hmm?

399
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,650
It's just gone.

400
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,350
Magic.

401
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:45,230
Black hole.

402
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,690
What if it's making the black hole bigger?

403
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:54,990
I use this power to create this Supai will disappear in 10
minutes, Mint.

404
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,270
Oh, I saw it, I saw it, I saw it!

405
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,990
I saw it!

406
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,530
You actually changed your name!

407
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:06,150
Create Oshi's open up meet and greet shop, Prophet.

408
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,410
Thank you, thank you!

409
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:07,790
Choo!

410
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:09,710
Choo!

411
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,470
I'll call this wife of creation power.

412
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,430
51st creation states.

413
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,310
The circle of wife.

414
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,210
Okay, fine, we'll push the button.

415
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,750
Yeah, I figured most people would be pushing this.

416
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,010
We have pushed the button three times!

417
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,950
Okay, I'm gonna give myself a limit.

418
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,310
I'm gonna give myself a limit, you guys.

419
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:51,530
I can only push the button 10 times We are going to have to
be extremely Careful About what What we are pushing the

420
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:59,890
button for What happens if you exceed it Then you guys can
choose a punishment for me

421
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:09,610
We'll think of a Maybe I'll have to do a punishment stream
or a punishment tweet or something.

422
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:18,650
So, so, for these next ones, I've already pushed it three
times.

423
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:19,690
I've already pushed it.

424
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,530
I've been willy-nilly.

425
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,990
Okay, wait, two of them have been very good.

426
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:30,510
The seeing up this girl's skirts and seeing and pushing and
creating anything, I think both of those were good pushes.

427
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,410
I don't remember what the first one was.

428
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,830
for a comment section override.

429
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,670
What's that?

430
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,670
Oh, it was the R.

431
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,890
I'm off to a con now.

432
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:54,570
Have fun, everybody.

433
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,250
Remember, Minto is Quito.

434
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:57,590
Thank you, Latua.

435
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,630
Have a good time at your con.

436
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:01,410
Okay.

437
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,360
You can have, okay, Well, you press the button.

438
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,660
You can have any car you want for free and no problems
attached.

439
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,040
But every time you drive it for a total of one hour, your
life gets shorter by one year.

440
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,420
I don't care about cars.

441
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,500
Are you guys car people?

442
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,180
I think I know.

443
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,380
I think there's a few people maybe in the chat that are car
people.

444
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,120
But always be the passenger.

445
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,760
I'll hire a driver.

446
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,700
I like cars.

447
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,280
but no.

448
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:48,940
Like, I don't think I've ever had, like, a dream car or
anything like that, so create nanomachine.

449
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,440
Nanomachine creates more nanomachines.

450
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,980
Original nanomachines disappears.

451
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,500
New nanomachines make a new war.

452
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,840
Fist fight a cyborg on top of a giant robot.

453
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:57,960
Yeah!

454
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,600
Just sell it.

455
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,740
So it's every time I drive it, right?

456
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,940
So, I could yeah, I could generate any car that I want.

457
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,700
But what if I, like, generate it?

458
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,880
What if I have it?

459
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:13,940
Oh, wait, it's not generated.

460
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,900
What if I have it?

461
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,980
People might be like, where'd you get that car?

462
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,520
I still don't think it's worth it, though.

463
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,520
I don't care about cars.

464
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,100
Cachow.

465
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,740
Selling for money, especially rare ones.

466
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,040
That sounds like such a pain in the butt, right?

467
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:48,060
What if, but then also, you know, You know, let's just,
let's, we don't know exactly how this works.

468
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:53,960
What if also the person driving it gets their life shorter
by one year?

469
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,660
Do I have to disclose that?

470
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,940
Then nobody will buy them, you know?

471
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,660
Oh, it's also, wait, it's just like you can have any car you
want for free, no problem.

472
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,560
Beep, beep, beep, beep, oh, boop, boop, no problem.

473
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,660
It says any car.

474
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,000
Is it unlimited?

475
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,080
Is it just one?

476
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,160
Oh, who knows?

477
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,700
I'll sell it to my enemy.

478
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,400
It says you.

479
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,440
Yeah, but...

480
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,140
I don't know.

481
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,820
What if I accidentally drive the car and I don't realize it?

482
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:35,170
What if the car somehow comes back to me?

483
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,930
And I accidentally drive it.

484
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,330
And I drive it for like...

485
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,370
10 hours.

486
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,070
That's a long time.

487
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:43,890
Drive!

488
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,310
Just how much tar I drive it.

489
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,890
Who do you think I was talking about when I saw my enemy?

490
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,430
Ronan, thank you!

491
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,090
What if I...

492
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,390
Can you drive?

493
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:03,910
I can!

494
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:04,510
I can drive!

495
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,070
I can!

496
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:06,530
I can!

497
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:09,870
So...

498
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,710
It's the plot of a Stephen King book?

499
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:12,490
No way!

500
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:23,950
I there's one what's it called there's one one there's only
one Stephen King book that I can think of that involves some

501
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:34,890
y 'all buy stuff in a car the lifespan shortening is a
pretty big problem for maybe a human but let's just assume

502
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:41,930
I'm human in some of these or in all of these you know let's
just assume I'm alive and I'm well and I'm healthy at a ripe

503
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:46,050
young age yeah

504
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:56,490
I don't think I will I don't like driving anyway but I don't
think I'm gonna press a button oh most people did not press

505
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,430
the button that's crazy

506
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:17,580
okay will you put oh come on come on these are so these are
so these are so pulling the world peace card is just It's

507
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,220
too easy.

508
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,540
It's too easy.

509
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,880
Come on.

510
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:22,640
Sci-fi.

511
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:29,300
World peace is achieved, but sci-fi, country, rock, and
metal music, video games, and books are abolished.

512
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,740
This is so stupid.

513
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,320
This is so dumb.

514
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,660
Who wrote this?

515
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,280
Like a 10-year-old wrote this.

516
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,060
Also, it's like sci-fi.

517
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,540
Wait, sci-fi is not a music genre.

518
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,500
This is so stupid.

519
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:51,560
I will not push the button because I don't want to give this
kid the satisfaction.

520
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,860
But also, it's just like...

521
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,920
I've watched Macross, and music will save the world.

522
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,760
I will not push the button!

523
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,780
Most people agree with me.

524
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,420
There are still sports.

525
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,700
Yeah, I skip out a protest.

526
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,420
Screw the world, I need my escapism.

527
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,440
Yeah, get out of here, world peace.

528
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,960
Video games, video games, video games, video games.

529
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,780
There's no video games, I'm basically out of a job.

530
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,280
The world can burn.

531
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:31,800
Burn.

532
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,840
Break stuff is a metal song, so we would miss you singing
that.

533
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,800
Yeah, without, yeah, exactly.

534
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:40,980
Exactly.

535
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:48,420
Also, why did they include, like, these random assortments
of... Why didn't they just say music?

536
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,700
Why is it only country, rock, and metal music?

537
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,400
What about pop music?

538
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,340
What about...

539
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,000
I mean, that means, like, a lot of idols would still exist.

540
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,200
But what... Why... Yeah, no metal gear.

541
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,240
I would just... I would rather...

542
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,060
I would rather die again.

543
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,020
No, no, no.

544
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,980
Anime is still in, though.

545
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,620
Yeah, but you would have no anime openings.

546
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,780
An anime... You would have no anime openings and closing
songs.

547
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,860
Well, you would have only...

548
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,540
Yeah, if it's Annie's song, actually.

549
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,640
If it's Annie's song, what if it's a country Annie's?

550
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,160
What if it's a rock Annie song?

551
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,440
But it's classified under Annie's song.

552
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,980
I mean...

553
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,260
Hmm.

554
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,380
Hmm.

555
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,400
Hmm.

556
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,140
Found the loophole.

557
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,180
I'm still...

558
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,860
I can't get over sci-fi.

559
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,800
I can't get over sci-fi.

560
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,160
Country Annie's song.

561
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,860
Oh, yeah, there is Country Annie's song.

562
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,980
Country Roads!

563
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:02,420
This isn't a video game.

564
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,660
It's an interactive story.

565
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,560
No more Konosuba endings.

566
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,840
No more cyberpunk OST.

567
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,460
Is that sci-fi music?

568
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,530
It's a vicious cycle.

569
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,850
You get world peace, but you have people starting wars to
get back video games.

570
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:36,130
I need war so Metal Gear is created.

571
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,110
I'm just kidding.

572
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,190
Thank you for the super chat.

573
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,610
Okay, next.

574
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,290
Will you press the button?

575
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,250
You get paid $20 an hour to play video games.

576
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:07,770
The only games you can play are Mario Kart Wii, Farm Bill,
the first one, Sonic 06, and Candy Crush Saga.

577
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:14,570
$20 an hour to play video games.

578
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:15,870
Someone said, only 20!

579
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:16,250
What do you mean?

580
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,090
That's a lot.

581
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,850
That's a lot of money to play video games.

582
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,120
Okay.

583
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,540
Sonic 06's peak, press it.

584
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,400
Not gonna lie.

585
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,460
I was thinking about streaming it somewhat recently.

586
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,940
What is Farmville?

587
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,800
What is Farmville?

588
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,060
Farmville.

589
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,640
What is this?

590
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,980
Play Sonic 06.

591
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,360
I live this.

592
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,440
Don't take the deal.

593
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,300
I'm talking about Hayden.

594
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,480
It's $800 a month.

595
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,520
Oh, I would definitely need another job then.

596
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,500
Wait, what do you mean $800?

597
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:06,920
Wait.

598
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,940
No, it's $20 per hour.

599
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,660
It's $20 per hour.

600
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,980
So if I play Candy Crush for, like, forever, you know?

601
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,920
That would be, you know, it's per...

602
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:38,520
we're not who's to say that I have to stop at 40 who's to
say that I have to stop at 40 40 hours right who's to say

603
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:53,960
you'll want to stop what do you do in Farmville it's a
Facebook game series of agriculture simulation social

604
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,260
network games developed by Zynga in 2009.

605
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,240
Ah!

606
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,400
Sorry.

607
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,560
Oh my god.

608
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,580
I think my...

609
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:04,440
I think my...

610
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,340
I think my...

611
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:05,980
I think my...

612
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,600
I think my...

613
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,420
I think my...

614
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,820
I think my cafe is haunted.

615
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,600
My lights just flickered.

616
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,100
I've seen VTubers play worse than this.

617
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,400
So you guys wouldn't hate if I became a...

618
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,360
Um...

619
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,980
A Farmville Mario Kart Wii...

620
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,700
Sonic 06 Candy Crush Saga streamer.

621
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:31,840
Can you zoom our max and have multiple Candy Crush gameplay
windows on stream and get paid more?

622
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,660
Hell yeah.

623
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,390
I'd be down.

624
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,510
I'm clearing my schedule.

625
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:47,470
I would judge you, but I would still watch.

626
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:58,550
Wait, if I was Mario Kart Wii, um, would you, would you
be...

627
00:42:58,570 --> 00:42:59,530
Would you guys be able to play?

628
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,530
It would be sad there's no MGS.

629
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:04,490
Yeah, add metal gear in here.

630
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,090
No more metal gear.

631
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,550
No, I also wonder the only games you can play are these.

632
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:15,370
Are they the only games that I can play to get paid?

633
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,130
Or can I...

634
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,210
Can I...

635
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,570
Can I also...

636
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,810
Play things without getting paid?

637
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:27,990
I wonder.

638
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:29,950
Lupal!

639
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,130
Can only to get paid.

640
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:36,850
No, only those ever?

641
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:38,530
It doesn't say it's unclear.

642
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:40,630
It's unclear!

643
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,710
I'd assume only those games at all.

644
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:47,270
Then I will not push the button.

645
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:50,530
Wow!

646
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:51,990
That's actually pretty close.

647
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:52,910
But you know what?

648
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:53,890
I get it.

649
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:54,630
I get it.

650
00:43:55,170 --> 00:44:00,270
If it's $20, if you don't play video games very much and
it's just like, I don't care about video games.

651
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:03,910
And you're just like, I'm going to make $20 an hour, which
is good.

652
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,810
That's good to make good 20, right?

653
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:08,530
To make that.

654
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:13,810
I mean, I never made that much at a job.

655
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:21,210
So, yeah, to do that.

656
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:22,890
Not so much anymore.

657
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:23,390
Really?

658
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,740
Depends on where you live.

659
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,460
Hmm.

660
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,560
Well, to me, to me, it feels like a lot.

661
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,580
To me, it feels like a lot.

662
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,240
As a former game tester, it isn't worth it.

663
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:51,760
We have, we have the, we have the, the real testimonies of
Trevor.

664
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:52,960
Thank you, Trevor.

665
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,820
$20 is $20.

666
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,540
So true, thank you.

667
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,120
Thank you for the $20.

668
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,360
Let's see, what else?

669
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,580
What's the next one?

670
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,340
Okay, wait a second though.

671
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,240
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

672
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:18,040
Before we get ahead of ourselves, this game, this, this,
this site is making me, it's trying to turn me into a

673
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,040
pervert, I think.

674
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:24,600
Hold on, before we get too excited, before we get too
excited, you can see through all clothes.

675
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,080
One.

676
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,660
Can I turn this power off?

677
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,240
Two.

678
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,080
Can I decide whose clothes I want to see through?

679
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:36,580
You know?

680
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:42,870
I don't want to see through everybody's clothes.

681
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:47,310
I don't want to see through everybody's clothes.

682
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:48,150
Read the downside.

683
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:50,670
But you cannot turn the power off.

684
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,430
Okay, wait a second.

685
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:56,130
Wait a second.

686
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:10,230
Okay, I read the butt when I first pushed this, but I
thought it meant like the power, like electricity I thought

687
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:14,180
it meant like when you when you're trying to sleep the
lights are left on

688
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:22,230
Mean Green would be awkward.

689
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:28,290
No, you guys nobody would come to my Mean Green knowing that
I'm staring at them naked Or maybe you would you little

690
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:36,070
freaks Maybe you would you'd be like oh my god I'm into
seeing my naked body right now

691
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:40,890
Wouldn't you feel self-conscious, though?

692
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:42,310
I totally would.

693
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:43,830
They're little freaks.

694
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,230
But you can't turn the power off.

695
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,310
So I just see everybody's naked.

696
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:54,110
Eventually, at some point...

697
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,070
At some point...

698
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:55,730
Oh my gosh, no.

699
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:56,810
I will not push this.

700
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:57,810
I will not push this.

701
00:46:58,750 --> 00:46:58,770
Because...

702
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:00,210
Because...

703
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,230
Clothing is sexy, everybody, okay?

704
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:05,850
Clothing is sexy.

705
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:06,950
That would mean...

706
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:12,810
No more bunny girl outfits, no more maid outfits, no more,
no more swimsuits, nothing!

707
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:15,370
It would just be naked bodies everywhere!

708
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,510
There's, that's not sexy at all!

709
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,490
It would be so boring!

710
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:23,170
Then I would just be so sad, no cosplay ever, ever, ever!

711
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:25,510
I would be so sad!

712
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:27,470
Oh my God!

713
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:28,630
No!

714
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:35,510
I just, this sounds really, anybody who pushes this button
is so sad I think.

715
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:57,170
I think But Man It's actually a wholesome reason Is it Is it
wholesome for me to want to be like Um To be like Um What do

716
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:01,910
I To be obsessed with Cosplay Is that wholesome?

717
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:10,790
I'm not sure Ha ha ha But anyway, I will not be pushing the
button.

718
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:13,470
Okay, see, three out of ten times so far.

719
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:16,130
Oh, most people did not push the button.

720
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:17,950
Very good.

721
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:18,870
Very good.

722
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:20,570
Also, there's a comment.

723
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:26,310
The first comment on here says, What if you can't find your
own clothes because you can't see them?

724
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:28,450
That's true.

725
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,550
Because other people wouldn't have the power.

726
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,170
And you can't find your own clothes.

727
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:45,890
your own clothes because because you can't see them and then
you could never go outside because what do you wait I guess

728
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:55,190
you would have to wrap yourself in a blanket all the time
blankets not clothes found the monkey paw I feel like I feel

729
00:48:55,190 --> 00:49:05,370
like a kid wrote this question too next will you press the
button you can fly but you can't speak anymore and tweet

730
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:06,530
like a bird

731
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:15,130
So I'm like, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep,
weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, like that?

732
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:19,070
Or should it become a bird?

733
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,070
Sign language?

734
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:25,490
You can fly, but I...

735
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:28,850
Yeah, you could just learn sign language, right?

736
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:29,590
Or...

737
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,240
Or tweet, or it sound like a bird.

738
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,840
Talk with chat GPT.

739
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,880
Yeah, tech, you mean techs to speak?

740
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:45,740
Yeah, use a keyboard.

741
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,100
And then you can fly.

742
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,240
Flying is like the best power ever.

743
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,140
Right?

744
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:53,880
I can flow.

745
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,320
I can fly a little bit.

746
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,060
But not like, I can't, not so good.

747
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,660
You're already fly AF.

748
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,100
Oh my gosh, I'm Magic Do Do Do Johnson.

749
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:03,880
Thank you.

750
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,140
I'm like, she's so fly.

751
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,880
Chirp, chirp flies away.

752
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,780
Mmm, you can flow.

753
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:14,180
Yeah.

754
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,640
Flying is dangerous power, but can be fun.

755
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,680
Why do you think it's dangerous?

756
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,120
Speak vocaloid.

757
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,000
Because, like, teleport is better?

758
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:30,780
No!

759
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,560
I think, even still, I think I would rather fly than
teleport.

760
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,320
Depending on, like, how you're able to fly, right?

761
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:39,460
Because...

762
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:40,620
Because...

763
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:45,920
Because if it uses like a lot of energy, then of course,
then teleporting might be better.

764
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,200
But like, if you're flying, it's nice.

765
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,440
Unless it's raining or something.

766
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:50,920
I don't know.

767
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:57,020
If the weather's good, you're just like, wee, and you're in
the clouds, and it's nice and breezy, and you enjoy the

768
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:57,560
journey.

769
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:58,840
I guess it depends.

770
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,120
You enjoy the journey or not.

771
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,020
When I tweet, can I communicate with other birds?

772
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,120
This is important.

773
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,140
That's true.

774
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,700
Do I gain bird powers?

775
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,860
Can I control the pigeons?

776
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,680
Oh, I like mince boys.

777
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,920
Yeah, you lay eggs.

778
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,040
Wait.

779
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,420
Free food!

780
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,900
Wait, if I lay eggs and I eat them, is that eating my own
children?

781
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:40,260
Well, they're not fertilized eggs, so maybe it would be
okay.

782
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:56,080
I think Yeah, unfertilized, so no Yeah, yeah More like
eating your own placenta People do that, though They eat

783
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:01,600
their placenta once they have a baby I think Right?

784
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,720
That's the placenta, right?

785
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,560
Haruka, welcome back Doomguy

786
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,640
You're four to five, you're gifted.

787
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,520
I've heard of that.

788
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,820
Yeah, I've heard of that too.

789
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,380
Placenta hot dogs.

790
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,000
I'm gonna start selling my eggs.

791
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,880
Wait, not my eggs.

792
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,040
Wait, I don't...

793
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:27,220
Wait.

794
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:32,220
If I were to lay eggs, I would sell my eggs, but I would
cook them as hot dogs.

795
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,700
If Vint lays an egg, is it a ghost egg?

796
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:47,660
like a hollow plastic Easter egg.

797
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,220
Then...

798
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,980
But it would be kind of gooey, I think.

799
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:56,790
Hmm.

800
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:58,570
Egg glizzy.

801
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:02,570
Let's see.

802
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:06,670
The only thing...

803
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:09,570
Well, I guess, like you said, you can't speak anymore, but
that doesn't...

804
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:10,330
That won't...

805
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:10,510
Wait!

806
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,590
You can't speak anymore.

807
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,750
But that won't stop me from singing!

808
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:21,550
They didn't say I couldn't sing!

809
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:22,390
Yippee!

810
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:24,450
It's the loophole!

811
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:27,290
I'll take 10 hot dog eggs.

812
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:33,310
Hatsune Minto.

813
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:37,790
I am Burb.

814
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,110
We can...

815
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:40,610
We are quite communicative.

816
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:41,830
Also, you could write.

817
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:42,650
Yeah, exactly!

818
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,730
But all of this...

819
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,270
This is a lot to trade off for being able to fly.

820
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,990
Do you guys think being able to fly is worth it?

821
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:52,990
I think I kind of do.

822
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:53,810
I think I kind of do.

823
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,710
I remember when I was a kid, I used to be able to wish I
could fly.

824
00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:00,010
I used to be able to say, I used to say, I wish I could fly.

825
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:09,230
I used to say, I wish, well, I used to say, I wish I had a
cloud like Goku.

826
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:13,750
Guys, I only have 10.

827
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:16,390
the cafe.

828
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:18,150
You're so right.

829
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:20,410
We'd save on so much.

830
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:22,490
So many resources.

831
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:26,010
I've already pressed it three times.

832
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:27,710
If I press it one more, there'll be four.

833
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,650
That's how math works.

834
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,360
Okay, I'll press it.

835
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:37,840
Bing, Bing.

836
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,340
What?

837
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,900
Most people said no.

838
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,680
Oh, that's crazy.

839
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,220
Really?

840
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,080
Okay.

841
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,600
Such a bad deal, you think so?

842
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,740
I would say no to, but I want to fly.

843
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:06,880
Fine, then.

844
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,020
Let's go to the next one.

845
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,960
Okay, well, you press the button.

846
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:17,600
You have an internal tracking device inside your brain that
finds anything that you lose.

847
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:25,480
but everybody everyone knows of you having this power and
every day there are people asking you to find some of their

848
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:37,720
belongings basically the plot of the little mermaid for
landowners you're so right oh my god you're right wait so

849
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:46,760
you have an internal tracking device inside your brain that
finds anything that you you lose but everybody knows of you

850
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,200
having this power and There are people asking you to find
some of their own belongings.

851
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:54,880
So it's only...

852
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,640
It's not people.

853
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,320
You could charge people.

854
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,220
I could charge people.

855
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:03,820
Micmac, thanks to the five.

856
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:04,400
Gifted!

857
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:06,540
We could monetize this.

858
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,920
Yeah, this seems like a really good business opportunity.

859
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,300
Who is Yu Yu?

860
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,240
I don't know.

861
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,220
Maybe they meant Union.

862
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:15,800
From Konasuba.

863
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:22,520
But...

864
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,580
It's only belongings.

865
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:25,340
Um.

866
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,260
Huh.

867
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,660
Uh-oh, I feel like I should press the button again.

868
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:33,860
I feel like this is a good deal.

869
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,680
Hey, Mint, have you seen my phone?

870
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,760
Yeah, have you looked up your butt?

871
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:47,000
Wait, do you remember when kids used to say up your butt and
around the corner?

872
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,240
Oh my gosh, wait.

873
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,500
What if someone's like, hey, I haven't seen my mom?

874
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:00,640
And it's like, oh yeah, she's in my room.

875
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:01,820
Hey, y'all.

876
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,120
People stop saying that?

877
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,280
Do people still say that?

878
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,100
Anton, welcome to membership.

879
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,000
Thank you.

880
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,220
Have you seen my wallet?

881
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,680
Yeah, have you checked?

882
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,200
Have you checked up your...

883
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,500
What do I just tell everybody?

884
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:32,200
their butt but it's only for what you lose not for what they
lose

885
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:42,240
i think it's just worded poorly because then why would
people be asking me about it

886
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:58,760
dragon thanks for the thank you don't do it i'll never end
honestly I don't lose that much stuff.

887
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:00,160
Actually, that's not true.

888
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,780
I lose my phone all the time.

889
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:08,660
I think I'm going to have to decline just because the
wording is kind of bad.

890
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:10,780
Forgot to join last month.

891
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,780
My bad homie.

892
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:12,540
No!

893
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,460
Thanks so much.

894
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:17,620
Okay.

895
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,280
Happens if crazy people threaten you.

896
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,780
I charge them more.

897
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:25,100
I say pay up.

898
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,100
Yep.

899
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,780
Alright, I'm just...

900
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,320
The wording's bad, so I will not.

901
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,740
Wow, most people pushed it.

902
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,020
Maybe because they also feel like they could monetize it.

903
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,240
Maybe they also are just like, yeah, I'll make a killing.

904
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:48,520
One, you're not forced to say yes.

905
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,180
Two, charge them if they want to.

906
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:50,520
Yeah.

907
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,660
Give them incorrect information.

908
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,260
But what if they come at me then?

909
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,300
What if they're just like, you were wrong?

910
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,040
I've been looking...

911
00:58:59,040 --> 00:58:59,740
What if someone comes...

912
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:03,960
Oh my gosh, what if the government starts asking me where
they're like, where it is...

913
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,340
Oh my gosh, what if they're like, where is Amelia Earhart?

914
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:09,960
Where is Amelia Earhart's plane?

915
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,840
Where is...

916
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,160
Where is...

917
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,820
Where is Cleopatra's tomb?

918
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:22,200
Sorry, those are on my brain because I was telling Matar
earlier about Cleopatra.

919
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,580
Where's my super suit?

920
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:31,880
Where is Metal Gear?

921
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:34,380
Oh my god.

922
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:35,800
Metal Gear?

923
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:36,980
Where is Garmin?

924
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:40,700
Where in the world is Garmin San Diego?

925
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,860
Duke, thanks for a month.

926
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,360
Okay, let's try the next one.

927
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:48,580
Will you press the button?

928
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,280
You would be the most popular person in town.

929
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,320
The only social network you could use...

930
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,440
Wait, you could use would be Google.

931
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,060
Plus?

932
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,560
I don't think you have...

933
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,420
Google Plus is not around anymore, right?

934
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:07,640
Yeah, Google Plus...

935
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,960
How old is this?

936
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,720
Google Plus is gone.

937
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,280
This one is old.

938
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,400
Ancient tech.

939
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,240
But like, you're the most popular person in town.

940
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,400
Also, like...

941
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,500
I don't...

942
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,380
Um...

943
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:33,200
You guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to be posting all of my
streams from now on from Google Plus.

944
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:34,700
Good luck, everybody.

945
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,600
B2, B5, oh, thanks for the

946
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:42,070
time.

947
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:44,010
Thank you so much.

948
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,510
You're already popular?

949
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:48,890
Stop it.

950
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:54,670
Google Plus ceased in 2019.

951
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:58,150
It was only 2019, it feels like it was so much older than
that.

952
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:02,010
Is it even still operational?

953
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:02,870
I don't think so.

954
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:05,330
Did you guys have Google Plus?

955
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:08,530
Did you guys have...

956
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,190
I think I tried using Google Plus.

957
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:14,810
I think because several idols that I liked started using it.

958
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:16,970
And I was like, fine, I'll use Google Plus.

959
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,550
Being popular is a curse, though.

960
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:20,570
I don't want to be...

961
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:21,430
I don't want people...

962
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:23,710
I don't think I want to be popular in the town.

963
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:28,970
I think I will not push the button.

964
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:32,430
I don't think I think I'm good.

965
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,030
I think I don't want to be the most popular person.

966
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,020
I think I'm okay

967
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:45,290
It can be back then used Google Plus.

968
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:56,370
Yeah, that's exactly what That's exactly why I used it
Because some of the some of the some of the AKB girls that I

969
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:57,870
liked were using it.

970
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:04,190
So Okay Didn't they force YouTube accounts into Google Plus
and change back?

971
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:04,770
I don't know.

972
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:07,990
Anything that Google is ever doing.

973
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:10,390
They confuse the heck out of me.

974
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:12,130
That's so weird.

975
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:14,010
Anyway, I will not be...

976
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:14,690
I don't care.

977
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:17,790
Yeah, most people...

978
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:21,990
Oh my gosh, there's comments on here from eight years ago.

979
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:24,250
This is so old.

980
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:28,770
This is so old.

981
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:34,650
This one comment, I hate attention, and I couldn't use
Tumblr?

982
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:35,730
Hell no.

983
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:41,670
Oh my god, I couldn't use Tumblr?

984
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:48,930
Oh no.

985
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:54,110
How else will I find out the ranking of the Tumblr sexy man?

986
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:59,590
Oh my gosh, I heard recently that Castio or Deistio.

987
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:04,830
DCL has been dethroned from Tumblr.

988
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:06,030
I've heard.

989
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:08,810
I've heard.

990
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:13,190
G Witch Sweep.

991
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:13,850
Yeah!

992
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:21,290
DCL was dethroned off of Tumblr by Suleimeo.

993
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:22,770
It's so crazy.

994
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:29,650
Which is the, which is, um, which is Saletta, Saletta and,
um, wait.

995
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:32,170
It's a, it's Gundam, Gundam Witch.

996
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:33,350
Witch for Mercury.

997
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:33,910
There we go.

998
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:36,030
Witch for Mercury.

999
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:37,930
It's them.

1000
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:40,410
Isn't that, I was like, Gundam?

1001
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:41,630
Gundam.

1002
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:42,730
Gundam.

1003
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:44,370
Gundam.

1004
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:50,850
I know, I knew, I knew G-Witch was really popular, but I
didn't think it was so, so, so popular.

1005
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:53,310
So, so popular.

1006
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:57,950
Mmm.

1007
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:02,000
I still need to get around to watching it.

1008
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,190
I see.

1009
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:05,070
Goodbye, DCO.

1010
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:14,510
When you press the button, everyone works for you, but there
is always a rebellion.

1011
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:16,590
Rebellion!

1012
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:20,750
Wait, this is so funny because this is literally just...

1013
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:26,630
This is literally just Chettino in Blue Archive.

1014
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:32,790
Cheney No and Blue Archive, where everybody...

1015
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,690
Blue Archive moment.

1016
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:36,170
I know!

1017
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:39,890
Hell yeah.

1018
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:41,390
I pushed the button.

1019
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:43,910
Rebellion!

1020
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:44,390
Rebellion!

1021
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:49,930
Maybe I got a little too excited about that one.

1022
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:51,990
I've already pushed the button five times.

1023
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:53,290
But that's okay.

1024
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:58,570
You have 10 million followers, but they're all on MySpace.

1028
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,560
Actually, I don't even know if I have one.

1029
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:40,760
Hold on.

1030
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:41,180
Oh, wait.

1031
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,200
I think I must have one.

1032
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:43,840
I must have one.

1033
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:44,040

Vic Boss!

1052
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:00,860

Oh my god, it's the world peace question again!

1055
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:11,780
The world will have no war, disease, destruction, and famine
for the rest of its days, but the USA will be wiped out from

1056
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:13,740
existence by a nuclear apocalypse.

1057
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,040
Will...

1058
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:30,260
Meet again, don't know where, don't know when I know we'll
meet again some sunny day.

1059
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,480
What was it, that was, um, what was it?

1060
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,320
What was that movie?

1061
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:37,700
Strange love!

1062
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:44,080
I must ask you a question, but I shave it for later, mint.

1063
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:44,980
Thank you.

1064
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:47,920
I'm not taking questions at this time, thank you.

1065
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:51,000
Whisper, whisper, whisper.

1066
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,260
Dr. Strange, though.

1067
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:57,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1068
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:04,040
I feel like I hate world peace questions just because I feel
like it's a low blow.

1069
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:05,000
You know?

1070
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,440
I feel like it's not so interesting.

1071
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:09,220
Let's just fall out.

1072
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,520
I'm not wasting my press, you guys.

1073
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,460
Yeah, they aren't fine.

1074
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,180
I feel like they're just kind of like whatever.

1075
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,220
It's like, world peace.

1076
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,200
Or, it's like, world peace, but...

1077
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,200
You lose fun!

1078
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:27,500
Ha ha ha!

1079
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:28,880
There's world peace!

1080
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:31,180
Nobody would go against world peace!

1081
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:31,900
That's what I feel like.

1082
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:36,380
Everybody who creates these questions are just like, if you
go against world peace, you're terrible!

1083
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,120
You're horrible!

1084
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,220
Why would you deny world peace?

1085
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,520
It's just like, because...

1086
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:44,340
You know.

1087
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:52,340
So it's lame So I do these out of protest Let's just ignore
it

1088
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,760
World peace but you lose sci-fi

1089
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,520
Will you press the button You get an alien where

1090
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:23,090
But you can never download games Okay this is also The comet
on the top comet is eight years ago.

1091
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:25,910
Okay, sundown right now.

1092
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:31,170
Oh my god, this is so funny.

1093
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:33,910
This is so...

1094
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:40,270
Whoever created this was just like alienware is the tops.

1095
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:41,910
The top of the top.

1096
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:43,530
Did I tell you guys I got a new laptop?

1097
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:46,370
I'm still setting it up.

1098
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:47,430
But I got a new laptop.

1099
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:49,750
It's a...

1100
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:52,190
It's a Lenovo one.

1101
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:55,450
World peace is real.

1102
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:57,070
Peace day never came!

1103
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,230
Is it alien wearing?

1104
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:10,250
But yeah, I got a new one, so...

1105
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:15,830
I will have it for streaming when I'm in Japan and stuff.

1106
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:25,450
Lenovo's Sorry Yeah, it's the Lenovo Legion It's the Lenovo
Legion Yes, yes, yes, yes It's the Legion It's the Legion

1107
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:32,550
Which I Was actually recommended before When I bought a
laptop previously And I went with the previous laptop And it

1108
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:45,310
was so bad But I heard a lot of Good reviews about this one
So You get a Lenovo laptop But you can never download games

1109
01:10:46,090 --> 01:11:00,330
Yeah, hashtag but um yeah so the last two laptops have been
Lenovo I think honestly like honestly no matter what kind of

1110
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:09,210
what kind of laptop or PC or well not PC I guess whatever
laptop you get there's always people always have issues some

1111
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:10,510
issues with something so

1112
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:20,610
let's hope it's good I hope so too so far it's been actually
so much better than my previous one so I am already I'm

1113
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:30,850
already feeling good about it I'm already feeling better
about it I was watching I was thinking about getting the

1114
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:49,530
what is it the ROG what was what's the not the not the
laptop oh wait blue archive the ROG Ally Yes, I was thinking

1115
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:56,150
of getting one and then I saw a video on it recently and
actually one of the laptops I was looking at looking at too

1116
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:57,390
was the ROG.

1117
01:11:57,790 --> 01:12:02,870
I'm kind of glad I didn't get it because um, oh some oh my
gosh

1118
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:12,230
If you haven't seen the video I was like I was so shocked
you saw the video.

1119
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:20,070
Yeah, I saw the video but I was thinking of getting the ROG
ally and then Um...

1120
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:20,710
I didn't.

1121
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:25,910
But also, a laptop I was looking at was ROG as well, so I
was like...

1122
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:27,670
Touched a bullet, maybe.

1123
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:28,310
Mmm.

1124
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:33,920
Yeah.

1125
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,240
But it was a while ago that I was thinking about it.

1126
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:41,380
I got the... I got a Steam Deck instead.

1127
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:44,960
I got a Steam Deck instead.

1128
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:46,260
I could play Metal Gear on it.

1129
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:48,400
This reminds me of another question.

1130
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,000
Unlimited bacon and no video games?

1131
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:53,920
for unlimited video games and no video games.

1132
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:57,720
What kind of bacon?

1133
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,080
Because I only like turkey bacon.

1134
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,340
Did you get the OLED Steam Deck?

1135
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,040
No.

1136
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,020
I'm still rocking my original Switch.

1137
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,060
Still got the old Steam Deck.

1138
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:23,400
So, but maybe I'll upgrade after a while.

1139
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:23,940
I don't know.

1140
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,280
Legion is nice because they have tons of porridge.

1141
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:34,660
It's so, it's also, It's not so heavy, and it's much bigger
than my last one.

1142
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:38,720
So I think I'm going to be able to stream on it pretty
easily.

1143
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:39,640
I'm really excited.

1144
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,140
I was really excited getting it.

1145
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,440
Might be a good idea to do a test stream before you leave if
you have time.

1146
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:47,680
Last streamer I watched got a new laptop for a trip.

1147
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,960
Ended suffering being bad than expected.

1148
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,040
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1149
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:52,940
Maybe I will.

1150
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,040
Okay, well, I'll do a test stream before.

1151
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,780
It won't be like a real stream.

1152
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,960
It'll be a test stream.

1153
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:02,020
I'll do like a short test stream before I go.

1154
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:03,840
Thanks for the idea!

1155
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,420
Okay, anyway.

1156
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,060
You guys, do I push the button on the alienware?

1157
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,560
You guys, it's alienware laptop.

1158
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:18,940
You guys, it's alienware laptop.

1159
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:21,280
But I can never download games.

1160
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:23,960
What's the point of getting a gaming laptop if you can never
download the games?

1161
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,480
What else would you do with it?

1162
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,340
browse Facebook.

1163
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:32,360
Sorry, I'm thinking of eight years ago.

1164
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,920
Okay, hold on, put your mind in eight years ago.

1165
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,060
Which, put your mind in eight years ago.

1166
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,400
Sell it.

1167
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:46,240
Okay, so the way this is worded, it says you can never
download games.

1168
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:51,420
Does that mean you can never download games again, or you
can never download games on the Alienware laptop?

1169
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:56,620
These, the people that write these, they need to be more
specific because I have questions.

1170
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:01,360
that, that, that must be answered.

1171
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:07,640
It's too vague.

1172
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,480
It's too vague.

1173
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,360
I think, I think we'll pass.

1174
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,380
Everybody, everybody in consensus?

1175
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:18,080
Oh my gosh, what is an alien?

1176
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:21,240
You know, I, my first, you know when I first started
streaming?

1177
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:26,660
When I first started streaming, it was, um, it was an alien.

1178
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:29,340
Oh.

1179
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:35,320
I spent a lot of money on my Alienware laptop, you guys.

1180
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:41,740
When I first, back in 2020, I spent a lot of money on it.

1181
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:43,680
You know what, this button is for me.

1182
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:45,520
This question is for me.

1183
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,680
Because was it worth it?

1184
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:51,800
Well, I mean, actually, I still have the laptop.

1185
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,820
It treated me well.

1186
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:56,840
It was a little hard to stream.

1187
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,180
No games, no way.

1188
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:02,020
Did you make this question?

1189
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:10,000
And you could still download games.

1190
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:10,500
I could.

1191
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,780
I downloaded them, yeah.

1192
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:17,960
Lady Mint.

1193
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:19,420
Integrated games are included.

1194
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,680
And browser games are okay.

1195
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,460
But what counts as an integrated game?

1196
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:26,200
Mind Sweeper?

1197
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:29,220
That explains so much.

1198
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:29,920
Hey!

1199
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:31,760
I...

1200
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:37,080
I I How much did I make at my job?

1201
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:52,620
I saved up a lot of money for my model And for my laptop I
made I think I made $13 an hour At my office job

1202
01:16:55,820 --> 01:17:18,710
I think I made $13 an hour And My model I remember I
remember I think I went with the lower pricing for my first

1203
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:31,350
model I cannot remember how much it was I think rigging was
about 200 or 300 dollars and then with my laptop and I had

1204
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:41,030
to get a mic and and the and the um I originally I I
originally used a mic on my headphones

1205
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:51,890
this is pre-2018 so it makes sort of sense what the question
or me no this was in 2020 for me um

1206
01:17:55,120 --> 01:18:07,600
this was 2020 so um some people might remember the headset
mic I only used it for like like three streams or something.

1207
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:10,060
But everybody complained about it so much.

1208
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:15,260
I'm not complaining, but everybody commented about it so
much that I spent it then.

1209
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:21,600
I then got a I then got a mic and a interface.

1210
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:23,760
Toaster mic the OG?

1211
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:24,560
Yeah!

1212
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:28,400
It was a mic on a headset.

1213
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:34,420
And then I still actually I still have the fan that
everybody helped fund me to get to.

1214
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:35,540
The Dyson fan.

1215
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:45,480
I still use it to this day so um all the way back i uh
people back then back then there were there were less of you

1216
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:53,960

be able to get the fan that i needed because i was stuck in

1217
01:18:53,960 --> 01:19:00,480
my closet and it was really really hot and i couldn't stream
for a long time because it would i would get like heat

Good luck with the work.

1246
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,000
Kind of like a trophy.

1247
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:56,240
Yeah, exactly.

1248
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:58,740
exactly exactly

1249
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:16,180
how did you save up for all this stuff when the idols are
right there i um i i i you know you might think that i'm

1250
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:26,700
like blowing my whole paycheck on idols but quite honestly
quite honestly my idols i can't buy so much from them mostly

1251
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:33,600
just put out stuff when i when like it's in japan so if i
were in japan i would be like everything would go to them

1252
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:49,570
probably hey you're a simp yes thank you in the past i used
to think that that comp the the your simp line was directed

1253
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:57,330
at you guys like as a joke but now i think it's just fully
me i can't believe that mint is a favorite fan and it isn't

1254
01:22:57,330 --> 01:22:59,630
any of them What are you talking about?

1255
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:03,690
Anyways, guys, I will be pushing the button for the alien
where left.

1256
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:07,590
I'm kind of curious.

1257
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:09,590
I want to kind of skew the ratio a little bit.

1258
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:12,410
I want people to press this and be like, say, I will not.

1259
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:13,250
What the hell?

1260
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:14,710
Who would press the button on this?

1261
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:16,750
And then realize how green.

1262
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:22,830
Everybody, if you get this question on willyoupressthebutton
.com, push the button so we can skew it to 90%, okay?

1263
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:26,390
What?

1264
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:28,170
Wait.

1265
01:23:28,190 --> 01:23:30,330
That's so many more people!

1266
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:34,810
Wait,

1267
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:41,690
I thought it was gonna be like 2%.

1268
01:23:41,690 --> 01:23:42,370
What?

1269
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:48,150
No way!

1270
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:53,110
No way, that's insanity.

1271
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:57,470
But also, the top comment says, You can never download
games.

1272
01:23:57,690 --> 01:23:59,990
Okay, I'll just get someone to do it for me.

1273
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:02,310
LuPaul, LuPaul, LuPaul!

1274
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:07,130
Loophole, loophole, loophole!

1275
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:12,010
Wow, that's so funny.

1276
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:15,070
Like, you guys, I'm getting an alien wear a laptop.

1277
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,150
Whoop-ee-doo!

1278
01:24:18,710 --> 01:24:19,530
Let's see.

1279
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:21,730
Alright, will you press the button?

1280
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:25,770
You have your perfect body, but everyone thinks you're
hideous.

1281
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:29,670
Um...

1282
01:24:31,730 --> 01:24:32,270
Um...

1283
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:33,770
Oh my god.

1284
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:38,210
The first, the comment on this is so sad.

1285
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:44,750
The top comment or the top comment on this is so sad.

1286
01:24:45,630 --> 01:24:46,410
I pressed the button.

1287
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:49,110
I am older and not attractive anymore anyways.

1288
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:50,750
Nobody looks at me anymore.

1289
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:52,310
And I am in poor health.

1290
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:54,930
Having the perfect body would make me healthy again.

1291
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:57,350
Plus I don't care what people think anyway.

1292
01:24:58,690 --> 01:24:58,990
What?

1293
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:03,470
No, that's actually so sad.

1294
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:12,190

1295
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:32,710

Hmm, snake's physique.

Perfectly flat.

1301
01:26:28,030 --> 01:26:28,910
Concave?

1302
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:31,730
I'm going to turn into like a black hole.

1303
01:26:36,690 --> 01:26:37,570

I've become...

1311
01:27:17,850 --> 01:27:22,090
I've become so ugly, but...

1312
01:27:22,090 --> 01:27:23,090
I've become a V-Tuber.

1313
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:24,930
That's why I'm a V-Tuber.

1314
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:28,490
That's why I'm a V-Tuber.

1315
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:34,050
People who can show their face scary.

1316
01:27:37,610 --> 01:27:49,150

feel like I I don't I mean not to say that I don't like I

1317
01:27:49,150 --> 01:27:57,750

means I don't even know I heard every size is a fry I was

That's so philosophical.

1324
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:23,000
Thanks, Doomguy.

1325
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:24,540
Personally, I'll press.

1326
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:28,540
I don't think I'm going to press because I don't really know
what a perfect body feels or like.

1327
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:29,780
I don't know what I would want.

1328
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,440
Could I be like a gelatinous mash?

1329
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:34,460
Like a slime girl?

1330
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:35,660
Would that count?

1331
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:39,020
Could I be like a slime body?

1332
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:41,080
Snake girl body?

1333
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:44,240
I think people would think I'm hideous if I'm a snake girl.

1334
01:29:50,360 --> 01:30:02,960
If that's perfect to you Ectoplasm body I feel I become that

01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,120

1336
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:16,620
Okay I'm not gonna press a button And I'm a ghost I don't
really care.

1337
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:18,800
Wow, most people did not press it.

1338
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:19,920
72%.

1339
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:20,280
Wow.

1340
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:21,840
Next.

1341
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:25,080
Anime!

1342
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:27,220
Anime!

1343
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:27,580
Anime!

1344
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:30,500
Will you press the button?

1345
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:34,980
You get to publish a manga or create an anime with whatever
storyline you want.

1346
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:40,360
But the manga art is terrible or anime is in terrible
English dub.

1347
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:41,360
Okay.

1348
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:43,860
Um.

1349
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:45,680
Yeah, but.

1350
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:47,260
What about the Japanese dub?

1351
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,700
What about the Japanese version?

1352
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:51,540
Who's the seiyu?

1353
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:53,840
Oh, no.

1354
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:57,780
Wait, publish a manga or create an anime with whatever
storyline you want.

1355
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:00,680
Whatever I want?

1356
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:09,120
Google says, JP cup sizes go up to 2.5 centimeter per
letter.

1357
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:15,680
So a 55S has a overbust of 105 to 107.5 centimeters.

1358
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:34,520
centimeters 41.5 to 42.5 inches i've definitely seen that
size on my on on dvnard this is literally one punch man

1359
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:44,820
you're a sim girl mint model funds oh thank you some
terrible english dubs are amazing yeah right

1360
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:58,020
the top comment on this is i just don't like manga and anime
so i don't really care

1361
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:14,020
oh no this is about anime oh my gosh what would we create
well recently i thought of a anime idea kind of i was like i

1362
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:19,560
was like kind of cooking i was like I was on the train in
Japan and I was like looking out the window.

1363
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,780
I was standing and like just watching things.

1364
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:29,160
And I thought of like either a four coma type anime or like
a short, you know how some anime like have really short

1365
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:29,700
episodes.

1366
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:30,920
Something really short.

1367
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,280
And I was like, what if there was like an anime?

1368
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:34,720
It would be like kind of slice of life.

1369
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:37,400
It would be really cute, kind of cozy like a Yudu camp.

1370
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:45,680
But like when I was on the train, I was like looking out the
window and just kind of seeing little flashes of...

1371
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:54,020
stuff that would be going on little like bits of life so
like it would be like we'd go by i don't know like a i don't

1372
01:32:54,020 --> 01:33:02,320
know like i would see i would see something like someone
walking their dog or something you know and in my brain i

1373
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:10,060
was like creating a whole story about them i was just like
they're walking their dog and their dog runs away and bumps

1374
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:15,160
into another guy walking their dog and then they fall in
love and it becomes and i was like what if there was like an

1375
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:20,620
anime about a girl who was like looking out the window and
would see little blips of life and then she would also come

1376
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:30,020
up with her own stories for like what people are like but
they'd be crazy you know so it's like just like 101

1377
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:38,240
Dalmatians but yeah and it's like they have like uh she so
she sees like someone doing their laundry and she just comes

1378
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:44,680
up with the whole like little storyline in her head about
like you know it's like what what is what is minto chan

1379
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:53,500
looking outside the window and thinking of i don't know it
was it's a very loose idea that i think came up with like um

1380
01:33:53,500 --> 01:34:00,200
when i was in japan and i was thinking about it i was like i
was like what like how how would i be able to turn this into

1381
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:07,700
an anime daydreamers delusions oh my gosh wait that sounds
like such a good title

1382
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:19,020
Oh my god, that sounds so cute Pitch a tamapa No, no

1383
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:39,940
So Yeah, sounds a little like Nietzsche Oh, I guess you're
right Yeah But it was like, it was like very short In my

1384
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:45,500
brain because it's like You can't really turn a show And
then like maybe another person it enters the train and like

1385
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:58,660
she also has her weird delusions we're all just all having
our delusions you know have ayami sensei draw the manga i

1386
01:34:58,660 --> 01:35:06,140
think it would end in my brain it's a little more say-so
than that i think with how ayami sensei would draw it it

1387
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:06,760
would become

1388
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:12,040
it would uh

1389
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:17,540
That's the plot of Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun.

1390
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:18,320
Is it really?

1391
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:19,840
I've never actually seen Nozaki-kun.

1392
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:26,540
But mine all takes place within a train.

1393
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:29,360
Anyway, what was it?

1394
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:29,880
Oh, yeah.

1395
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:33,180
Publish a manga or create an anime with whatever storyline
you want.

1396
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:35,560
Storyline I want.

1397
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:39,500
Um.

1398
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:40,940
Um.

1399
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:43,960
Me.

1400
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:46,280
out with me.

1401
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:47,500
I'm Mint Phantom.

1402
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:54,980
And you might be wondering, how did I get into this
situation where, um, uh, there's girls.

1403
01:35:56,280 --> 01:36:00,740
There, I'm at a, I'm at a bathing suit wet t-shirt contest.

1404
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,920
And, um, oh, fuck, push the button.

1405
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:06,300
Okay.

1406
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:14,280
Ah, you guys, I only have three more tries to push the
button.

1407
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:18,280
They only have three more to push the button!

1408
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:20,240
What's wrong?

1409
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:20,980
What's wrong?

1410
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:21,760
Oh gosh.

1411
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:22,420
Oh gosh.

1412
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,200
It's okay.

1413
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:27,600
The JP, the Japanese version, the English dub is fine.

1414
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:28,820
I don't care if it's bad.

1415
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:32,060
I just need the Japanese to be good.

1416
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:40,000
And even if the manga art is bad, it's fine.

1417
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:44,340
If it's a ghost story style dub, I will press the button in
a heartbeat.

1418
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:48,120
So true.

1419
01:36:55,410 --> 01:36:56,510
Will you press the button?

1420
01:36:57,190 --> 01:37:00,050
You'll be able to create your own reality at any time.

1421
01:37:01,010 --> 01:37:06,930
But after 25 uses, you will be stuck in your own reality and
not be able to go back to the original world.

1422
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:07,970
Ooh.

1423
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:13,660
Easy press.

1424
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:15,240
Press the button and call Kojima.

1425
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:19,640
It's time for Metal Gear and the anime with the terrible
English stuff.

1426
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:24,320
Oh my god, Kiefer Sutherland's back.

1427
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:26,720
He's voicing all of Snake.

1428
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:28,120
Oh no!

1429
01:37:32,230 --> 01:37:37,880
Not to say he was bad, but you know, not having David Hater
would probably make it bad, right?

1430
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:47,400
I feel like there's no downside to this, right?

1431
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:52,100
Be able to create your own reality at any time.

1432
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:53,940
Like, what's the downside?

1433
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:55,200
25 uses.

1434
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:55,780
You just...

1435
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:58,520
You just keep track, Bozo.

1436
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,660
But also, you only need one use.

1437
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:02,920
Yeah, I'm kind of confused.

1438
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:03,780
What if you, like...

1439
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:05,780
What if you...

1440
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:07,260
Create...

1441
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:10,140
If you create your own reality, you're controlling
everything in it.

1442
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:10,800
Are you not?

1443
01:38:11,380 --> 01:38:12,380
Like, reality...

1444
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:14,280
I...

1445
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:15,320
If you're...

1446
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:18,560
If you're creating your own reality that's...

1447
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:19,760
Whatever you want...

1448
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:21,820
then it's like

1449
01:38:26,070 --> 01:38:30,910
just use it 24 times and save the 25th to reset everything
if necessary yeah

1450
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:41,830
oh my gosh you guys I'm only gonna have two more presses

1451
01:38:45,130 --> 01:38:54,030
okay here we go yeah I figured most people would press this
I figured most people would press this

1452
01:38:57,370 --> 01:39:09,150
yeah it makes sense yeah makes sense like how is it a choice
yeah you're right yeah well you press the button you are

1453
01:39:09,150 --> 01:39:20,050
never sick but you are always exhausted I might as well be
sick I might as well be sick right um what do you mean I'm

1454
01:39:20,050 --> 01:39:29,090
always exhausted no I will not press the button on that that
sounds crazy That's me now.

1455
01:39:29,490 --> 01:39:29,710
No.

1456
01:39:34,850 --> 01:39:37,050
I'm always exhausted anyways, Saj.

1457
01:39:37,210 --> 01:39:37,550
No.

1458
01:39:38,730 --> 01:39:39,870
Well, then you could push it.

1459
01:39:40,090 --> 01:39:41,950
Because then, you know, different.

1460
01:39:42,170 --> 01:39:45,770
But there will be some day that you're not always exhausted.

1461
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:49,470
But if you push the button, you'll always be exhausted.

1462
01:39:49,810 --> 01:39:50,050
You know?

1463
01:39:50,770 --> 01:39:53,470
There will be, there will come a time when you are not
exhausted.

1464
01:39:53,810 --> 01:39:54,090
You know?

1465
01:39:54,630 --> 01:39:57,230
And so you, that will be a time.

1466
01:39:57,250 --> 01:40:11,130
what happens and at that time you'll feel so much better and
you'll feel so good and feel so much relief next will you

1467
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:17,890
press the button you can watch any book is a film in your
head but Kristen Stewart is the lead actor what's wrong with

1468
01:40:17,890 --> 01:40:28,150
that Kristen Stewart a solid snake you can watch any book as
a film in your head.

1469
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:29,690
What?

1470
01:40:31,330 --> 01:40:31,650
Who?

1471
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:32,950
Kristen Stewart?

1472
01:40:33,710 --> 01:40:37,950
She's the girl that played... I think... is this like around
Twilight era or something?

1473
01:40:38,050 --> 01:40:39,970
She's the girl that plays Bella Swan in Twilight.

1474
01:40:41,030 --> 01:40:42,330
This is such a 2012 thing.

1475
01:40:42,590 --> 01:40:43,850
It really is.

1476
01:40:44,570 --> 01:40:46,210
What's wrong with Kristen Stewart?

1477
01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:51,510
I see no downside, but I also see no upside.

1478
01:40:52,690 --> 01:40:54,890
I mean, Kristen Stewart's fine, but like, Shrek?

1479
01:40:56,650 --> 01:40:57,230
Oh, yeah.

1480
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:59,130
Yes, my favorite novel, Shrek.

1481
01:41:00,890 --> 01:41:02,030
Oh yes.

1482
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:06,850
I love reading the classics.

1483
01:41:08,130 --> 01:41:09,090
To kill a mocking bird.

1484
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:10,490
The Great Gatsby.

1485
01:41:11,030 --> 01:41:11,370
Shrek.

1486
01:41:16,090 --> 01:41:17,730
Shrek is an old book actually.

1487
01:41:18,510 --> 01:41:18,790
Huh?

1488
01:41:19,150 --> 01:41:20,530
Shrek is based on a book?

1489
01:41:22,530 --> 01:41:23,150
Wait, really?

1490
01:41:25,330 --> 01:41:26,670
Shrek the novel.

1491
01:41:31,070 --> 01:41:31,770
Shrek!

1492
01:41:31,970 --> 01:41:33,550
With an exclamation point!

1493
01:41:37,810 --> 01:41:38,010
Oh!

1494
01:41:38,750 --> 01:41:42,510
Shrek is a fantasy comedy picture book published in 1990!

1495
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:44,070
What the?!

1496
01:41:44,070 --> 01:41:47,310
The book served as the basis for the first Shrek film!

1497
01:41:47,670 --> 01:41:47,750
Oh!

1498
01:41:49,890 --> 01:41:50,590
Oh!

1499
01:41:50,710 --> 01:41:50,850
What the?

1500
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:58,300
It's a Shrek with an exclamation point!

1501
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:03,680
But is it a... wait, is it a...

1502
01:42:04,940 --> 01:42:10,040
oh it's a it's a picture book though it's a picture book
everybody it's a picture book it's a picture i don't think

1503
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:15,560
picture books count i don't think picture books count
because because i don't think picture books count because

1504
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:25,160
they're pictures should only be books books books sammy
thanks for the one man thank you i'd do it to see her play

1505
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:26,620
bilbo faggins

1506
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:42,180
I says that it says any book That means manga doesn't count
Yeah, probably No, manga shouldn't count either I think it

1507
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:48,220
should be only books books Not picture books Not comic books
Just book books Regular books

1508
01:42:52,600 --> 01:43:00,720
I cannot believe that there is a Shrek book What is going
on?

1509
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:08,120
This isn't real Is this a real part of the book?

1510
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:09,260
Hold on.

1511
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:15,120
Wait, is this a real part of the book?

1512
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:16,120
Hold on.

1513
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,200
The picture looks legit, though.

1514
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:29,220
I don't think this is real.

1515
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:34,880
Shrek was still hungry, so he ate a bolt of lightning.

1516
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:37,140
Yum, said Shrek.

1517
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:38,580
My diet is everything.

1518
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:42,000
You eat my food, said the cloud that made the lightning.

1519
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:47,500
Okay, said Shrek, I will get your tip from my bag.

1520
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:51,400
Shrek reached into his bag for his gun that killed clouds.

1521
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:56,880
Yeah, I gotta read this book.

1522
01:43:58,560 --> 01:43:59,240
It's real.

1523
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:09,630
Will you press the button?

1524
01:44:10,190 --> 01:44:14,510
You can eat lightning bolts, but you have to kill the
clouds.

1525
01:44:15,850 --> 01:44:16,630
lightning bolt.

1526
01:44:17,530 --> 01:44:18,070
I think I would.

1527
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:20,330
I would, would, would.

1528
01:44:22,170 --> 01:44:22,790
Oh wait.

1529
01:44:26,330 --> 01:44:27,830
Wait, there's another one.

1530
01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:31,310
That's the same picture, but different... Okay, I think it's
edited.

1531
01:44:36,610 --> 01:44:37,570
What is... What?

1532
01:44:37,810 --> 01:44:39,010
Wait, is this the real thing?

1533
01:44:39,090 --> 01:44:41,350
Now I can't... Now I don't know.

1534
01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:46,450
Wait, now I don't know what's real!

1535
01:44:47,130 --> 01:44:47,870
This one.

1536
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:52,770
Fat raindrops began sizzling on Shrek's hot knob.

1537
01:44:53,690 --> 01:44:57,030
Did you ever see something so disgusting, said lightning to
thunder?

1538
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:59,050
Never, thunder growled.

1539
01:44:59,370 --> 01:45:00,430
Let's give him the works.

1540
01:45:01,150 --> 01:45:03,530
Lightning fired his fierce bolt straight at Shrek's head.

1541
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:06,750
Shrek just gobbled it, belched some smoke, and grinned.

1542
01:45:07,490 --> 01:45:09,110
Lightning, thunder, and rain departed.

1543
01:45:09,310 --> 01:45:10,270
They just laughed.

1544
01:45:13,090 --> 01:45:13,930
Is this real?

1545
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:19,140
His what?

1546
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,100
What's a hot knob?

1547
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:27,300
His head?

1548
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:28,800
Is it those little...

1549
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:29,580
The little bump?

1550
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:31,320
I think it's the bump on his head, you guys.

1551
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:36,160
That is the real book.

1552
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:42,720
So would Christian be the Minotaur or the farmer?

1553
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:47,440
No way.

1554
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:52,520
I think...

1555
01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:54,000
it's the thing on the top of his head, right?

1556
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,780
Is it the little lump on his head?

1557
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,460
The actual book is more ridiculous than the edit.

1558
01:46:01,860 --> 01:46:03,140
Wait, what's...

1559
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:04,540
Which is real?

1560
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:06,780
Well, I don't think the first one is real.

1561
01:46:07,420 --> 01:46:07,820
Is this one?

1562
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:08,920
This one seems more real.

1563
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:12,540
The first one seems a little...

1564
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:14,020
I don't think Shrek has a gun.

1565
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:19,140
Oh, that's a stick.

1566
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:19,900
That's not a gun.

1567
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:20,480
Oh my gosh.

1568
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:21,460
I thought it was a gun.

1569
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:23,040
Okay.

1570
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:24,120
Nicole!

1571
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:25,280
Welcome to VemboShift.

1572
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:25,900
Thank you!

1573
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:29,300
I'm going to not press the button because I don't really
care about Kristen Stewart.

1574
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:34,320
And also... I don't feel... I feel... I don't... I mean...

1575
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:36,460
I don't see a very good side to this.

1576
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,080
Most people didn't care.

1577
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:41,760
Most people were like, whatever.

1578
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:45,360
Who would play Mint Phantom?

1579
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:50,980
Um...

1580
01:46:55,940 --> 01:46:57,540
Will you press the button?

1581
01:46:58,140 --> 01:47:00,320
You will have the force, but you will become a cat.

1582
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:01,460
It's my dream.

1583
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:03,960
It's my dream to become a cat.

1584
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:04,780
I just want to be...

1585
01:47:04,780 --> 01:47:05,520
Jack Black!

1586
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:08,280
Oh my gosh, I would love Jack Black to play me.

1587
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:10,040
In the movie?

1588
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:12,680
Jack Black!

1589
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,140
Jack Black in the movie!

1590
01:47:16,540 --> 01:47:17,620
What's the downside?

1591
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:19,060
Yeah, you become a cat!

1592
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:22,520
I see no downside at all here.

1593
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:32,330
I've always wanted to become a cat.

1594
01:47:32,730 --> 01:47:40,690
I always think, you know, if I ever can become reincarnated,
since I'm already dead, if I can never be born again, I want

1595
01:47:40,690 --> 01:47:41,670
to be a cat.

1596
01:47:41,930 --> 01:47:43,130
I want to be born as a cat.

1597
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:52,710
I want to be born as a cat in a house where I'm just loved,
and I just get to lay around and do nothing all the time.

1598
01:47:55,870 --> 01:47:57,410
Cat that shoots lightning.

1599
01:47:58,330 --> 01:47:59,250
What is the force?

1600
01:47:59,430 --> 01:48:02,790
The force is like being able to move stuff with your brain,
right?

1601
01:48:02,910 --> 01:48:03,410
That's it?

1602
01:48:04,650 --> 01:48:05,850
Will you be a poopy cat?

1603
01:48:06,470 --> 01:48:06,950
Maybe.

1604
01:48:12,730 --> 01:48:13,610
It's a trick.

1605
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:15,470
Cats already have the force.

1606
01:48:17,050 --> 01:48:19,330
Mint, I am your father, meow.

1607
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:26,230
I kick telekinesis.

1608
01:48:28,230 --> 01:48:30,210
Telekinesis, mind control, lightning!

1609
01:48:32,030 --> 01:48:36,110
You guys, if I press this, I only have one more shot before
I can, before I'm out.

1610
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:38,150
I only have one more button press.

1611
01:48:40,370 --> 01:48:41,430
I only have one more.

1612
01:48:41,710 --> 01:48:43,890
Also, as you can see, 328 comments.

1613
01:48:44,050 --> 01:48:45,930
People are very passionate about this one.

1614
01:48:47,810 --> 01:48:48,890
I only have one more.

1615
01:48:50,450 --> 01:48:53,710
Well, the force is an energy field around all of us.

1616
01:48:54,550 --> 01:48:55,930
Oh, okay.

1617
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:00,360
Press it.

1618
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:18,540

let's do 10 more and within that 10 I could only do one okay

1619
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:34,360
so I'm gonna say left 10 I'm just gonna I'm gonna move it
over here so we have 10 more and then I can only push the

1620
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:35,280
button on one of them.

1621
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:39,580
You become a member of your favorite musical group!

1622
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:43,060
But the person you end up replacing will completely cease...

1623
01:49:43,060 --> 01:49:43,600
No!

1624
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:53,020
I would never.

1625
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:55,320
Do not press.

1626
01:49:55,820 --> 01:49:56,820
Do not press.

1627
01:49:57,440 --> 01:50:00,600
The person who you end up replacing will completely cease to
exist.

1628
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:03,740
Like...

1629
01:50:03,740 --> 01:50:07,480
If I become a member of my favorite musical group...

1630
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:18,420
I wouldn't even be a man I wouldn't even be probably so much
of a fan if they didn't exist I will not press and I'm glad

but you have I'm bird person.

1636
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:24,680
I think I'm already half eagle a little bit.

1637
01:51:24,860 --> 01:51:29,700
But the eagle flies higher above the clouds.

1638
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:36,560
Press it.

1639
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:37,380
No.

1640
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:39,440
What are the upsides?

1641
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:40,680
I'm half eagle.

1642
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:42,000
What are you talking about?

1643
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:45,800
I'm a harpy at that point.

1644
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:46,440
I'm a harpy.

1645
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:57,780
No, is this the American dream?

1646
01:51:58,680 --> 01:51:59,400
I think so.

1647
01:52:00,020 --> 01:52:00,760
I think so.

1648
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:07,100
I'm sure there might be some people, some EU watchers today
because my streams are a little bit early.

1649
01:52:08,420 --> 01:52:09,440
This is it.

1650
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:12,280
This is the American dream!

1651
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:38,900
Pay my monthly rent to the half eagle main.

1652
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:40,440
Thank you.

1653
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:41,980
Soaring puts.

1654
01:52:42,820 --> 01:52:43,780
Aren't you already a cat?

1655
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:50,600
Imagine just flying over the competition going, your
flightless legs are useless against me.

1656
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:51,280
Scaa!

1657
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:58,260
The downside is now that you have to live in Philadelphia.

1658
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:05,300
Oh, I still have my mustache on, I forgot.

1659
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:06,800
Sorry.

1660
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:08,780
Oh, the revolution is over.

1661
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:15,100
Forget the age of 30, I hear monster girls are in demand.

1662
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:18,160
I mean, I'm a ghost, so I'm technically a monster girl.

1663
01:53:18,940 --> 01:53:19,220
Right?

1664
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:23,160
I think I'm technically a monster girl.

1665
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:27,040
I'm in the Mario 7 and the Monster Girl Encyclopedia, so...

1666
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:32,160
I mean...

1667
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:37,440
You know, so...

1668
01:53:37,980 --> 01:53:40,120
And I hear ghosts are in demand.

1669
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:45,950
What was this?

1670
01:53:46,030 --> 01:53:46,230
Oh.

1671
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:54,040
I really want to become an eagle.

1672
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,200
I want to become happy.

1673
01:53:56,220 --> 01:54:02,780
Eagle you guys anything from here on out if I push this
button anything else we're gonna have to not push the button

1674
01:54:02,780 --> 01:54:06,580
or else I'm gonna get punished

1675
01:54:10,830 --> 01:54:23,970
you can't touch a ghost 0 out of 10 monster GF okay hold on
hold on 0 out of 10 give me at least one point because I

1676
01:54:23,970 --> 01:54:32,430
could still possess you and also I mean, you can't really
touch me.

1677
01:54:32,510 --> 01:54:34,450
But I mean, there's also ectoplasm.

1678
01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:36,570
Don't think so hard about it, okay?

1679
01:54:39,190 --> 01:54:41,050
Take the punishment like a boss.

1680
01:54:43,150 --> 01:54:45,250
Push the button because eagles are free!

1681
01:54:45,870 --> 01:54:46,390
Sky!

1682
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:47,010
Sky!

1683
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:51,530
Why did most people not push the button?

1684
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:54,830
What the?

1685
01:54:55,270 --> 01:54:57,130
Most people did not push the button!

1686
01:54:59,350 --> 01:54:59,870
Why?

1687
01:55:00,630 --> 01:55:02,070
What's the downside?

1688
01:55:04,850 --> 01:55:06,050
What's the downside?

1689
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:15,240
You are conscious in your dreams, but you only have
nightmares.

1690
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:17,060
Where is the good side?

1691
01:55:19,140 --> 01:55:21,520
Where is the good side of this one?

1692
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:24,640
Cowards.

1693
01:55:24,820 --> 01:55:25,880
They were all cowards.

1694
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:27,920
There is no good...

1695
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,360
This one is actually so bad.

1696
01:55:29,580 --> 01:55:32,220
Why would I want to be conscious in my dreams if they're
just nightmares?

1697
01:55:32,700 --> 01:55:34,500
Yeah, why would that be good?

1698
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:39,980
Maybe because then if I'm conscious, I could be like, oh,
this is just a nightmare.

1699
01:55:40,220 --> 01:55:41,760
This is just a, or rather, this is just a dream.

1700
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:42,620
It's no big deal.

1701
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,940
And then I won't be so scared of it, I'm guessing.

1702
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:48,400
Is the thought process, no.

1703
01:55:48,860 --> 01:55:49,860
Get this out of here.

1704
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:58,460
You will swap genders, but you will still have the same
personality and relative attractiveness as before.

1705
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:00,080
So I'll be fucking ugly.

1706
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:02,300
I will not push the button.

1707
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:03,320
What?

1708
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:07,960
Anyway.

1709
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:11,100
This is only bad for me.

1710
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:18,660
If I still have the same personality and everything, I'm
just going to be actually a terrible, ugly idol Oji-san.

1711
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:20,540
And all my idols will hate me.

1712
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:26,560
I can only be Oji-san because I'm a girl.

1713
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:27,540
And so it's...

1714
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:32,120
Oh, come on.

1715
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:36,460
Let's see.

1716
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:37,180
Oh, wait.

1717
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:39,960
Uh, what?

1718
01:56:40,280 --> 01:56:40,840
Left is 7.

1719
01:56:45,260 --> 01:56:46,180
Well, you press the button.

1720
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:53,080
You can sleep with anyone you choose, but every other person
has to be someone you don't want to sleep with.

1721
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:00,260
I like sleeping by myself, though.

1722
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:03,620
It's too hot in the bed.

1723
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:13,900
I will not be pushing the button.

1724
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:16,260
What's the good side of this?

1725
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,960
It's just disrupting my sleep schedule.

1726
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:23,880
Wow, most people didn't press the button.

1727
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:27,800
Next.

1728
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:29,040
Six.

1729
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:32,240
So, oh, not 56.

1730
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:32,620
Six.

1731
01:57:33,260 --> 01:57:35,280
So far, these are not so bad.

1732
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:40,000
Half-Life 3 will be released for free for everyone.

1733
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:43,620
But you can never play.

1734
01:57:55,370 --> 01:57:57,270
Take one for the team.

1735
01:58:04,530 --> 01:58:06,150
Save the people, Mint.

1736
01:58:08,230 --> 01:58:09,510
That's a freebie.

1737
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:10,350
No, no, no.

1738
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:11,590
There are no freebies.

1739
01:58:12,170 --> 01:58:12,530
There are.

1740
01:58:13,490 --> 01:58:15,630
Remember that Henya once Half-Life 3?

1741
01:58:28,460 --> 01:58:29,060
But...

1742
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:36,440
I'll be your hero.

1743
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:46,280
Hold on.

1744
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:47,860
I need some dramatic music.

1745
01:58:52,910 --> 01:58:53,130
What the hell?

1746
01:58:53,370 --> 01:58:53,430
Oh.

1747
01:59:06,730 --> 01:59:08,050
Why are all these playlists?

1748
01:59:09,650 --> 01:59:10,150
Hold on.

1749
01:59:11,950 --> 01:59:14,490
I don't know how dramatic this is, but I'm gonna play it.

1750
01:59:33,210 --> 01:59:34,930
I've never played Half-Life.

1751
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:41,160
But.

1752
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:46,480
For everybody's sake.

1753
01:59:54,180 --> 01:59:55,460
For everybody's sake.

1754
01:59:56,180 --> 01:59:58,280
Who's been waiting for Half-Life 3.

1755
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:02,720
All those years.

1756
02:00:03,620 --> 02:00:04,600
That you've been waiting.

1757
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:05,800
Hoping.

1758
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:06,640
Praying.

1759
02:00:07,380 --> 02:00:07,820
Wishing.

1760
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:10,600
On a fallen star.

1761
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:12,840
Someday please.

1762
02:00:13,940 --> 02:00:26,560
Half-Life 3 and I hope I hope it's a great one I hope I

1763
02:00:30,610 --> 02:00:41,870
hope it's the greatest disappointment of your life I hope
you waited 20 years 84 years for shit I hope it comes out

1764
02:00:41,870 --> 02:00:48,650
and I never play it I can never play it and I hope it's
Terrible for all you guys and it will be the worst.

1765
02:00:48,810 --> 02:00:53,970
Oh my god, and it's going to be awful It's going to be so
bad.

1766
02:00:54,150 --> 02:00:58,870
You're going to be so disappointed Yeah

1767
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:16,040
Anyway, where were we?

1768
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:19,760
Where were we?

1769
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:21,380
Oh, yeah

1770
02:01:29,960 --> 02:01:32,920
Most people didn't press it.

1771
02:01:33,980 --> 02:01:35,700
I contributed to the green.

1772
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:46,280
To lighten up this moment, has Mint heard the Burger King
rep commercial about SpongeBob Square Ass?

1773
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:47,360
This is real.

1774
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:48,700
I've never heard that.

1775
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:07,480
Half-Life 3 is going to be a live service game.

1776
02:02:12,380 --> 02:02:12,800
Done,

1777
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:18,740
done, done.

1778
02:02:25,540 --> 02:02:29,900
You can make anything taste like what you want it to, but
you will be constantly hungry.

1779
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:31,340
Oh, no, no, no.

1780
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:35,540
Constantly hungry, then what's the point of even eating what
I want?

1781
02:02:36,140 --> 02:02:37,060
What's the point?

1782
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:37,960
What's the point?

1783
02:02:41,100 --> 02:02:43,780
Half-Life 3, but with Blue Archive characters?

1784
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:46,560
Okay, do you want the greatest game ever?

1785
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:49,600
Put Blue Archive characters in anything, and I'll be happy.

1786
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:51,620
You should let Hania decide your punishment.

1787
02:02:53,100 --> 02:02:53,400
Okay.

1788
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:56,000
I will not.

1789
02:02:57,320 --> 02:02:59,240
And most people agree with me.

1790
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:01,840
Four.

1791
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:07,940
What if you could stay alive forever, but you cannot
communicate with anyone but yourself?

1792
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:12,320
Um, I, who?

1793
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:13,220
Okay.

1794
02:03:16,820 --> 02:03:19,000
Alexa, play break so I've been fed them.

1795
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:26,200
Um, this is like, wait, do people actually want to stay
alive forever?

1796
02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:28,580
Shinsular, thanks for the 10 gifts!

1797
02:03:29,940 --> 02:03:32,700
Do people actually want to stay alive forever?

1798
02:03:32,980 --> 02:03:34,360
Like, is that actually something?

1799
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:48,060
Like, if people ever just think about it for just a tiny
moment, like like just a tiny moment and also think you

1800
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:59,320
cannot communicate with anyone but yourself like it would be
so bad we get boring fast right this is like a huge

1801
02:03:59,320 --> 02:04:03,520
trade-off so no okay next

1802
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:16,260
You get your own free private jet and a lifetime supply of
jet fuel, in-flight snacks, drinks, in-flight movies, and a

1803
02:04:16,260 --> 02:04:18,820
busty flight attendants!

1804
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:36,000
But the busty flight attendants.

1805
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:41,080
But the bust...

1806
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,820
But your private jet will one day be used in a massive
terrorist attack.

1807
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:56,200
You do not know which day that will be.

1808
02:04:58,020 --> 02:04:59,440
But then they'll die!

1809
02:04:59,900 --> 02:05:03,720
You guys, I can't because the busty flight attendants will
then cease to exist, I think.

1810
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:06,900
I think they'll die on the plane.

1811
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:10,720
That would be so sad.

1812
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:15,240
That would be so sad for them.

1813
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:16,540
And the world.

1814
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:20,260
Being deprived of less buba.

1815
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:23,100
Save them.

1816
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:25,800
By not have...

1817
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:25,940
By...

1818
02:05:25,940 --> 02:05:26,200
By...

1819
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:26,420
By...

1820
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:26,560
By...

1821
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:27,380
But also...

1822
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:36,400
Also, what if we do invent, invent, um, oh wait, it says you
get your own free private jet and a lifetime supply of jet

1823
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:37,160
fuel.

1824
02:05:38,380 --> 02:05:39,580
In-flight snacks.

1825
02:05:40,360 --> 02:05:41,480
Drinks in flight.

1826
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:42,620
What do you mean snacks?

1827
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:43,900
What are we talking about?

1828
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:47,560
Like those tiny bags of pretzels that has two pretzels in
them?

1829
02:05:48,860 --> 02:05:49,720
I don't want snacks.

1830
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:50,800
I want a whole ass meal.

1831
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:52,280
Save the buba.

1832
02:05:53,140 --> 02:05:53,980
Save the busty.

1833
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:55,460
This is literally.

1834
02:05:57,400 --> 02:06:02,220
This is, are you guys for, save the animals or kill the
animal?

1835
02:06:03,800 --> 02:06:05,240
That's a GDQ question.

1836
02:06:05,940 --> 02:06:11,020
Save the Busty Flight Attendance or kill the, hold on, let's
make a poll.

1837
02:06:11,180 --> 02:06:12,520
Let's make a poll.

1838
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:19,180
Okay guys, save or kill.

1839
02:06:20,260 --> 02:06:23,140
Save the Busty Flight Attendance.

1840
02:06:32,590 --> 02:06:52,870
attendance start save the animals did it go oh there it is
oh wow a lot of people for saving them oh I spelled

1841
02:06:52,870 --> 02:06:58,280
attendance wrong it's okay save the Save the booba, save the
booba.

1842
02:07:00,820 --> 02:07:01,700
Save the BFA.

1843
02:07:02,820 --> 02:07:04,780
Hashtag save the BFA.

1844
02:07:05,300 --> 02:07:05,960
Save the frames.

1845
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:09,300
Kill the animals, save the frames.

1846
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:13,020
Hmm.

1847
02:07:16,820 --> 02:07:19,550
Most people are saying save the bus safe flight attendants.

1848
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:22,640
Flying is miserable anyway.

1849
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:25,100
I don't mind flying so much, I'll be honest.

1850
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:28,100
Greetings from Germany.

1851
02:07:28,380 --> 02:07:29,060
First time watcher.

1852
02:07:29,140 --> 02:07:30,000
Long time chatter.

1853
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:31,120
Save the attendance.

1854
02:07:32,260 --> 02:07:32,860
Thank you.

1855
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:33,880
Implode.

1856
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:36,820
Plot twist.

1857
02:07:36,980 --> 02:07:38,140
The attendants are the terrorists.

1858
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:48,510
And what if my jet is actually Metal Gear?

1859
02:07:51,690 --> 02:07:53,410
What are their demands?

1860
02:07:53,570 --> 02:07:54,770
Big boss's body?

1861
02:07:55,330 --> 02:07:55,870
Or...

1862
02:07:59,890 --> 02:08:03,910
Even with that free, planes will bankrupt you.

1863
02:08:04,190 --> 02:08:04,670
That's true.

1864
02:08:06,230 --> 02:08:08,070
No more business class feet.

1865
02:08:08,510 --> 02:08:08,690
True.

1866
02:08:09,550 --> 02:08:13,790
No, it's getting interesting.

1867
02:08:18,510 --> 02:08:18,690
Hmm.

1868
02:08:20,970 --> 02:08:21,370
All right.

1869
02:08:22,390 --> 02:08:24,670
Most people say, save the BFA.

1870
02:08:25,930 --> 02:08:26,590
Goodbye, frame.

1871
02:08:26,690 --> 02:08:28,270
I will not be!

1872
02:08:29,010 --> 02:08:30,530
Wow, most people said no.

1873
02:08:33,030 --> 02:08:35,010
Most people also believe in the BFA.

1874
02:08:37,830 --> 02:08:38,570
Let's see next.

1875
02:08:45,050 --> 02:08:48,950
Everything you say will come true, but you will get the
opposite of what you say.

1876
02:08:49,570 --> 02:08:52,010
This is just like a monkey paw thing, isn't it?

1877
02:08:52,530 --> 02:08:53,870
What is the good side of this?

1878
02:08:56,690 --> 02:08:56,850
it.

1879
02:08:57,110 --> 02:08:57,850
Keep the BFA.

1880
02:08:59,830 --> 02:09:00,950
Then it's out of my hands.

1881
02:09:01,110 --> 02:09:02,190
I wash my hands of this.

1882
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:07,590
What if one of the attendants is just Ocelot in a skirt and
an open blouse?

1883
02:09:08,290 --> 02:09:10,130
I don't think he is busty enough.

1884
02:09:15,430 --> 02:09:16,770
Is he busty enough?

1885
02:09:16,910 --> 02:09:17,410
I don't know.

1886
02:09:19,030 --> 02:09:19,990
Just say the opposite.

1887
02:09:20,830 --> 02:09:27,810
So say everything I say won't come true.

1888
02:09:28,250 --> 02:09:28,430
Wait.

1889
02:09:28,710 --> 02:09:28,970
Hold on.

1890
02:09:29,490 --> 02:09:30,450
Wait.

1891
02:09:33,870 --> 02:09:34,790
Say.

1892
02:09:35,350 --> 02:09:35,570
I.

1893
02:09:36,330 --> 02:09:38,010
Everything I say.

1894
02:09:39,470 --> 02:09:39,810
Wait.

1895
02:09:42,290 --> 02:09:44,670
How do you, how do you phrase this?

1896
02:09:50,670 --> 02:09:55,030
Say all the negative.

1897
02:09:55,150 --> 02:09:55,590
Oh yeah.

1898
02:09:57,830 --> 02:09:58,570
Gosh.

1899
02:09:59,310 --> 02:10:01,610
I wish I won't.

1900
02:10:01,630 --> 02:10:21,780
have a busty flight attendants I don't want one million
dollars in my bank account but then what if you accidentally

1901
02:10:21,780 --> 02:10:33,360
say something say something that what if you accidentally
what if you accidentally mess it up this one is a scam I

1902
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:42,460
feel like it's too easy to miss to slip up you know it's too
easy to slip up i think get rid of it after your best wishes

1903
02:10:42,460 --> 02:10:48,480
again right i will not be pressing the button okay guys wow
he only pressed it one over

1904
02:10:52,180 --> 02:11:00,320
um this one is also kind of wait you can become invisible
but it works only one minute every day what's the downside

1905
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:06,020
what's the downside That it's a minute?

1906
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:06,920
Who cares?

1907
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:07,860
It's a free minute.

1908
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:09,860
There's no downside.

1909
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:11,200
Hold on.

1910
02:11:11,340 --> 02:11:12,040
You guys...

1911
02:11:13,220 --> 02:11:14,220
Let's skip this one.

1912
02:11:14,380 --> 02:11:15,100
Let's skip this one.

1913
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:18,220
It's just a net good.

1914
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:20,020
Can I press it, but not count?

1915
02:11:21,980 --> 02:11:23,860
Actually, can I just skip it?

1916
02:11:25,980 --> 02:11:28,520
Yeah, there needs to be a downside for it.

1917
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:35,140
But you're a ghost anyway.

1918
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:37,240
Yeah, it doesn't really even pertain to me.

1919
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:40,560
I'm in your rooms all the time.

1920
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:42,260
Okay.

1921
02:11:42,820 --> 02:11:43,480
Skip, skip.

1922
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:46,840
I'm the minority.

1923
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:48,320
Okay.

1924
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:11,540
You get 3,000 pounds or US $3,000 for Brits per day.

1925
02:12:12,280 --> 02:12:15,040
But you cannot exchange it for your local currency.

1926
02:12:22,650 --> 02:12:23,100
Um...

1927
02:12:28,970 --> 02:12:32,270
So I just moved to...

1928
02:12:32,270 --> 02:12:33,830
I just moved there?

1929
02:12:35,570 --> 02:12:36,250
Like...

1930
02:12:36,250 --> 02:12:37,170
What's the down?

1931
02:12:39,750 --> 02:12:43,510
I just get 3,000 pounds a day!

1932
02:12:45,710 --> 02:12:46,970
Living in England.

1933
02:12:48,030 --> 02:12:52,550
Just save up and move.

1934
02:12:52,690 --> 02:12:53,630
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1935
02:12:55,810 --> 02:13:08,370
to the uk but it's free money you can't exchange it for your
local currency so like what if i go on a trip i can exchange

1936
02:13:08,370 --> 02:13:11,890
it for that currency so i could exchange it for like

1937
02:13:16,030 --> 02:13:20,150
i could exchange it to another currency is fine

1938
02:13:24,090 --> 02:13:29,330
uh I'd rather die than become British.

1939
02:13:29,750 --> 02:13:32,750
This one is a great one to end on for our EU friends today.

1940
02:13:34,490 --> 02:13:36,470
For those watching in the EU hours.

1941
02:13:37,670 --> 02:13:42,210
This one maybe is a good one to end on.

1942
02:13:43,310 --> 02:13:44,730
Local means wherever you are.

1943
02:13:45,550 --> 02:13:47,290
So I'm just stuck in the UK.

1944
02:13:48,750 --> 02:13:49,350
I suppose.

1945
02:13:51,010 --> 02:13:51,470
Right.

1946
02:13:53,630 --> 02:13:54,270
Right.

1947
02:13:58,050 --> 02:14:01,550
But also, also, consider this, consider this.

1948
02:14:02,170 --> 02:14:07,790
If I buy something with a credit card, it doesn't matter
what the currency is, right?

1949
02:14:07,930 --> 02:14:09,290
It just uses it.

1950
02:14:10,350 --> 02:14:12,390
So, a simp.

1951
02:14:12,990 --> 02:14:15,930
It doesn't say you can't exchange it for yen and then buy
everything on AmiYami.

1952
02:14:16,130 --> 02:14:17,970
So, I don't know about exchanging things.

1953
02:14:18,070 --> 02:14:20,470
Well, oh, two yen is fine, yeah.

1954
02:14:23,590 --> 02:14:24,070
Right?

1955
02:14:24,270 --> 02:14:26,070
So, Bitcoin?

1956
02:14:32,620 --> 02:14:36,020
Oh, no, not the cryptocurrency loophole.

1957
02:14:40,630 --> 02:14:47,050
So yeah, if I just, if I just put it, if I just have it in
my bank account and use my credit card, it should be fine.

1958
02:14:48,330 --> 02:14:49,250
There's no negative.

1959
02:14:49,910 --> 02:14:51,370
Push that button!

1960
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,760
Well, guys, oh, wait.

1961
02:14:58,860 --> 02:15:00,260
I think I...

1962
02:15:00,260 --> 02:15:01,620
There we go, zero.

1963
02:15:03,820 --> 02:15:06,360
Well, guys, I pushed it.

1964
02:15:06,700 --> 02:15:07,800
I went over the limit.

1965
02:15:10,760 --> 02:15:11,660
I went over the limit.

1966
02:15:15,940 --> 02:15:17,260
I will have a punishment.

1967
02:15:18,320 --> 02:15:19,920
I will accept my punishment.

1968
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:21,880
Somehow.

1969
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:24,300
We'll figure something out.

1970
02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:27,540
I missed one earlier.

1971
02:15:27,920 --> 02:15:28,280
Wait, I did.

1972
02:15:29,860 --> 02:15:32,280
Wait, the left or the...

1973
02:15:32,300 --> 02:15:34,580
Two punishments.

1974
02:15:34,940 --> 02:15:35,240
No!

1975
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:38,380
The limit does not exist!

1976
02:15:39,220 --> 02:15:40,200
What have you been watching?

1977
02:15:40,760 --> 02:15:41,920
Mean Girls lately?

1978
02:15:50,940 --> 02:15:53,220
Your punishment is a speedrun.

1979
02:15:53,820 --> 02:15:56,980
MGS1, but you must skip all cutscenes.

1980
02:15:57,420 --> 02:15:58,500
That's just torture!

1981
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:01,440
Matara gives one, Hena gives one.

1982
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:08,880
and I will ask Matara for a punishment from each of them.

1983
02:16:09,420 --> 02:16:12,800
And I will do a punishment from each of them.

1984
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:16,360
So once I know the punishment, here I'll even message them
right now.

1985
02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:17,440
I think Matara is streaming.

1986
02:16:20,720 --> 02:16:21,880
Oh my god.

1987
02:16:24,460 --> 02:16:25,720
This is so cute.

1988
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:28,040
Maya, oh my gosh, if you're still here, I just saw your
message.

1989
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:29,400
I just opened up.

1990
02:16:32,320 --> 02:16:33,160
Okay, Matara.

1991

punishment for me

1994
02:17:37,890 --> 02:17:41,010
Whenever I receive these, I will do them, I suppose.

1995
02:17:42,270 --> 02:17:44,070
Can you give me a...

1996
02:17:53,470 --> 02:17:54,970
Okay, okay, okay.

1997
02:17:55,550 --> 02:17:57,170
And it was for Half-Life 3.

1998
02:18:14,700 --> 02:18:22,700
Hold on, sorry, I'm responding

1999
02:18:31,850 --> 02:18:32,110
to something.

2000
02:18:39,550 --> 02:18:44,910
I sent that exact emoji.

2001
02:18:45,710 --> 02:18:49,350
I sent that exact emote to Henya of me crying.

2002
02:18:51,130 --> 02:18:52,550
The same one.

2003
02:18:53,410 --> 02:18:54,210
Both of them.

2004
02:18:56,290 --> 02:18:57,270
And also the PN.

2005
02:18:58,210 --> 02:19:04,790
PN, PN, PN, PN, PN, PN, PN, PN, PN.

2006
02:19:07,850 --> 02:19:09,070
Hoki-doki, guys.

2007
02:19:09,750 --> 02:19:10,010
Wow.

2008
02:19:10,730 --> 02:19:11,790
We had some tough ones.

2009
02:19:11,910 --> 02:19:14,190
Some of them were really easy, but some of them were pretty
tough.

2010
02:19:14,690 --> 02:19:18,370
I'm glad that we are all in agreement that we would become
eagle people.

2011
02:19:20,870 --> 02:19:22,610
Eagle people rise!

2012
02:19:23,470 --> 02:19:24,430
Eagle people!

2013
02:19:25,530 --> 02:19:25,850
Roooo!

2014
02:19:46,780 --> 02:19:47,260
Anyway.

2015
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:49,620
Thank you guys for the stream today.

2016
02:19:52,340 --> 02:19:53,700
This was very interesting.

2017
02:19:53,940 --> 02:19:55,100
Some of these prompts were crazy.

2018
02:19:59,180 --> 02:20:00,440
Thanks for all the button pushing.

2019
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:02,400
Just curious if you saw the trailer for Beetlejuice 2.

2020
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:03,600
I did!

2021
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:05,780
Not sure if he's a ghost role model for you or not.

2022
02:20:06,060 --> 02:20:07,640
Oh my gosh, I did see the trailer.

2023
02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:09,240
I saw it last night.

2024
02:20:10,020 --> 02:20:11,080
Oh my gosh.

2025
02:20:11,460 --> 02:20:15,100
And how Winner-Writer's back.

2026
02:20:16,080 --> 02:20:19,440
And they like, it's all still so campy looking.

2027
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:20,880
It looks so good.

2028
02:20:21,380 --> 02:20:22,040
I'm excited.

2029
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:23,000
It looks kind of fun.

2030
02:20:23,220 --> 02:20:24,260
I probably will watch it.

2031
02:20:25,620 --> 02:20:26,860
But you have to play football.

2032
02:20:27,160 --> 02:20:29,260
Oh, but I'm an eagle.

2033
02:20:29,360 --> 02:20:30,240
I'm good at football.

2034
02:20:30,420 --> 02:20:30,900
It doesn't matter.

2035
02:20:31,240 --> 02:20:33,220
I could probably take them all down in one person.

2036
02:20:33,660 --> 02:20:34,220
One eagle.

2037
02:20:34,680 --> 02:20:35,480
Half person.

2038
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:36,840
I could take them down.

2039
02:20:36,980 --> 02:20:38,360
Half person, half eagle.

2040
02:20:40,220 --> 02:20:41,520
Baloney, thanks for the 10 gifted.

2041
02:20:46,060 --> 02:20:47,740
No, I just got here, PN.

2042
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:48,400
Sorry.

2043
02:20:49,860 --> 02:20:50,880
Sorry, sorry.

2044
02:20:51,500 --> 02:20:53,480
I'm cautiously optimistic about the movie.

2045
02:20:54,660 --> 02:20:55,940
Looks like they're still using stop motion.

2046
02:20:56,100 --> 02:20:56,560
Yeah.

2047
02:20:57,380 --> 02:20:59,000
I know, it's really cool.

2048
02:20:59,900 --> 02:21:00,220
Hmm.

2049
02:21:01,320 --> 02:21:01,720
So.

2050
02:21:03,580 --> 02:21:06,180
I've never seen Beetlejuice, but the Broadway tour is going
to be here.

2051
02:21:06,280 --> 02:21:06,720
Should I go?

2052
02:21:07,300 --> 02:21:07,620
Oh!

2053
02:21:08,060 --> 02:21:09,960
I've seen some clips from the Broadway show.

2054
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:10,780
It looks funny.

2055
02:21:10,900 --> 02:21:11,620
It looks interesting.

2056
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:14,380
Why not?

2057
02:21:15,020 --> 02:21:17,160
If you guys say my name three times, I might appear.

2058
02:21:17,580 --> 02:21:18,080
But sometimes.

2059
02:21:19,540 --> 02:21:21,580
Sometimes it only feels like if I don't want to appear.

2060
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:22,640
Sometimes I don't want to appear.

2061
02:21:23,500 --> 02:21:23,700
You know?

2062
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:26,140
So it's like when you call to a cat.

2063
02:21:26,240 --> 02:21:26,620
You're just like.

2064
02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:27,140
Come on.

2065
02:21:27,160 --> 02:21:27,640
Come here, cat.

2066
02:21:28,280 --> 02:21:29,500
Sometimes they come, sometimes they don't.

2067
02:21:29,920 --> 02:21:30,580
It's the same with me.

2068
02:21:30,780 --> 02:21:31,140
You can try.

2069
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:34,440
Try saying, mint phantom, mint phantom, mint phantom, and I
might appear.

2070
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:35,800
Sometimes I won't.

2071
02:21:36,520 --> 02:21:37,260
I don't know.

2072
02:21:38,100 --> 02:21:38,860
I don't know.

2073
02:21:38,940 --> 02:21:39,720
It depends on how I feel.

2074
02:21:40,020 --> 02:21:40,060
You know?

2075
02:21:40,420 --> 02:21:41,820
So you can go ahead and try it.

2076
02:21:41,900 --> 02:21:42,960
I don't know.

2077
02:21:48,470 --> 02:21:48,770
Oh!

2078
02:21:56,350 --> 02:21:56,710
Ew!

2079
02:21:57,410 --> 02:21:58,710
Matara sent me one too.

2080
02:21:59,590 --> 02:22:00,250
Oh my god.

2081
02:22:00,470 --> 02:22:00,830
No!

2082
02:22:07,340 --> 02:22:08,740
Hanya sent me one.

2083
02:22:11,420 --> 02:22:12,460
Hanya sent me one.

2084
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:15,180
She sent me the game of Sisyphus.

2085
02:22:17,500 --> 02:22:19,700
She wants me to play as a Sisyphus.

2086
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:21,380
No!

2087
02:22:29,980 --> 02:22:31,040
And Matara sent me one.

2088
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:32,560
She said kiss me on the mouth.

2089
02:22:32,980 --> 02:22:33,200
No.

2090
02:22:33,540 --> 02:22:34,200
Something else.

2091
02:22:52,360 --> 02:22:54,180
It's not that that bad though, is it?

2092
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:55,560
It can't be that bad.

2093
02:22:56,080 --> 02:22:57,540
I saw Fauna cleared it, right?

2094
02:22:59,580 --> 02:23:01,420
Randall, thanks for the five gifting.

2095
02:23:01,620 --> 02:23:02,400
Thank you so much.

2096
02:23:08,790 --> 02:23:10,130
Can't be that bad, right?

2097
02:23:29,590 --> 02:23:31,290
Fauna just ran up the hill.

2098
02:23:35,210 --> 02:23:37,170
She cleared it without touching the boulder.

2099
02:23:40,990 --> 02:23:43,030
Oh my god, God Gamer.

2100
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:46,490
God Gamer.

2101
02:23:48,050 --> 02:23:56,590
Well, um, then I, um, then I'll, uh, do, I'll, I'll play it,
I guess.

2102
02:23:58,150 --> 02:23:58,870
Wait, hold on.

2103
02:23:59,430 --> 02:24:00,630
Uh oh, my YouTube is frozen.

2104
02:24:01,350 --> 02:24:02,550
I'm just gonna look at chat from here.

2105
02:24:10,010 --> 02:24:11,890
I meant about that poll.

2106
02:24:12,350 --> 02:24:13,080
Don't worry about it.

2107
02:24:14,170 --> 02:24:17,490
Don't even worry about it.

2108
02:24:18,390 --> 02:24:23,170
If you say phantom three times fast, you get a big phantom
appreciate power time.

2109
02:24:24,770 --> 02:24:25,590
Ooh, wait, what?

2110
02:24:28,710 --> 02:24:30,470
Oh, no, wait, this doesn't work either.

2111
02:24:30,670 --> 02:24:35,170
I can't, I can't see you or I can't, I can't scroll up, so I
can't read it.

2112
02:24:35,370 --> 02:24:35,730
Hold on.

2113
02:24:38,470 --> 02:24:39,270
One second.

2114
02:24:42,050 --> 02:24:43,310
There we go.

2115
02:24:45,030 --> 02:24:49,050
You get big phantom appreciate power time when you're in the
gym.

2116
02:24:50,250 --> 02:24:50,930
Wow.

2117
02:24:54,050 --> 02:24:56,550

02:24:57,930 --> 02:25:00,030
Get the phantom gains, everybody.

2119
02:25:02,190 --> 02:25:03,190

02:25:03,210 --> 02:25:03,910

2121
02:25:06,070 --> 02:25:06,510
