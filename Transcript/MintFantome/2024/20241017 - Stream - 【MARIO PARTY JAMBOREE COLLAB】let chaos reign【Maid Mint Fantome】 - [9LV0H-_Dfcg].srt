1
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,780
I made it!

2
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,380
Oh my god.

3
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,240
Ok.

4
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,540
Wait one second.

5
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,500
Wait one second.

6
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,320
Ok.

7
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,240
Hi!

8
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,480
Close.

9
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,140
Welcome.

10
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,280
Welcome.

11
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,460
What's going on?

12
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,880
There we go.

13
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,900
Now I can probably hear it.

14
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:11,920
Oh my gosh.

15
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,480
Panic.

16
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,180
Welcome.

17
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,960
Hi everybody.

18
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,460
Sorry.

19
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,200
I wasn't really prepared.

20
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,820
I wasn't really prepared.

21
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,440
I was running around trying to...

22
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,060
Oh my gosh.

23
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,580
My Joy-Cons were like, woah, we're low battery.

24
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,100
And I'm like, what are you talking about?

25
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,080
I've been charging this thing all night.

26
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,040
And then I found other ones and then I think it was being silly.

27
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,020
Anyway.

28
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:52,760
Welcome to Mario Party Jamboree!

29
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,640
I will be playing today with...

30
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,640
With Matara, with Raimu and with Giga.

31
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,220
And I need your guys' help.

32
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,100
I can't choose.

33
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,240
You guys, I want to be Boo, obviously.

34
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,340
I want to be Boo, but this is the first time you can ever play as Toad.

35
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,730
I don't know if you guys have heard my Toad impression, but it's pretty darn good.

36
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,030
It's her birthday.

37
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,330
Happy birthday, Jelly!

38
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,070
Oh gosh, I'm playing also through OBS, so I'm probably going to lose all these mini-games.

39
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,330
Let's do a poll.

40
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,030
Minto, I got paid.

41
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,750
I can super chat.

42
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,550
Amelia!

43
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,870
Thank you!

44
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,990
Wait, let me do a poll.

45
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:50,690
Start a poll.

46
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,290
Who to play?

47
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,150
Toad, Boo.

48
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,130
I'm polling my chat.

49
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,670
You need to hear your Toad voice before we can decide.

50
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,210
Okay, what do you want me to say?

51
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,910
What do you want me to say?

52
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:17,990
What do you want me to say?

53
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,030
Okay.

54
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,230
Can we hear your Boo impression?

55
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,930
Sounds like a dying goat, but it's close.

56
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:33,750
Maybe.

57
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,870
Alright, now what do you want me to say as Toad?

58
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,710
My intro?

59
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,180
Oh wait, most people are voting for Boo though.

60
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:10,740
Okay.

61
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,400
Okay.

62
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,060
We need to re-vote.

63
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,380
Why are you playing through OBS?

64
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,160
Because I'm stressed!

65
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,920
Because I wasn't ready.

66
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,360
Oh wait, I guess I could play through.

67
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,020
Hold on.

68
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,320
Wait, maybe I can play through my monitor.

69
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,640
Hold on, I have to change it.

70
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,920
I have to change it, I think.

71
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,080
I think everyone voted before they heard Toad.

72
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,100
SMH.

73
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,200
You guys should have believed me!

74
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,560
You guys should have believed me.

75
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,560
You guys should have...

76
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,780
You should have been like, I have faith in Minto's...

77
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,300
Faith in Minto's Toad voice.

78
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,640
How could you?

79
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,280
I think they're kind of waiting on me.

80
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,780
So I'm just gonna pick Toad, you guys.

81
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,560
We'll pick Toad, we'll pick Toad.

82
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,880
We'll pick Toad.

83
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,200
And of course I'm not gonna talk as Toad the entire time.

84
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,960
But let me...

85
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,520
Let me move this over here.

86
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,460
I have to move everything onto my skinny monitor.

87
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,000
The music's so cute!

88
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,520
And then I'll have to adjust the foogies...

89
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,860
For each person playing.

90
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,500
But who is playing who?

91
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,220
You won't know.

92
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,060
Okay, I'm gonna tell them that I'm ready.

93
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,640
I'm ready.

94
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,010
Okay, I'm not playing through OBS anymore.

95
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,350
We're good.

96
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:56,490
We're good.

97
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,870
Let me turn Matara down.

98
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,150
I think last time she was on my stream, she was way loud.

99
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,650
I'm gonna put her at zero.

100
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,130
Hello?

101
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,470
Hello!

102
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,950
Of course you pick up first.

103
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,810
You love me the most.

104
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,210
No, it's because I need to put you at zero.

105
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,090
Bye, Matara!

106
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,110
I can't hear her.

107
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,190
I don't know what she's saying.

108
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:23,770
Mint!

109
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,790
Can you hear me?

110
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,370
Mint!

111
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,110
Hi, Lime!

112
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:28,910
Hello!

113
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,470
I just need a minute to eat.

114
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,650
Because I've been up since like 9.

115
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,310
And I have not eaten yet.

116
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,350
I forgot to eat.

117
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,410
You forgot to eat?

118
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,630
Okay, take your time.

119
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,110
Wait, you said you were gonna wake up at like 6am.

120
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:42,690
What happened?

121
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,650
Lazy pants?

122
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,370
I'm too tired.

123
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,270
I burned out a little too hard.

124
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,570
You're two days into your subathon, girl.

125
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,950
But it's because I streamed for like 12 hours.

126
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:55,650
I know.

127
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,310
You chose this.

128
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:58,530
I did.

129
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,290
I'm so excited.

130
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,750
I'm kind of really looking forward to tomorrow.

131
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,270
Where it's just not a collab day.

132
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,110
Not that I'm not happy being here with you guys or anything.

133
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,630
I think you hate us.

134
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,210
I do.

135
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,590
All of you.

136
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,110
How was your day?

137
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,510
How's y'all doing?

138
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:18,370
Good.

139
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,470
It's my day off.

140
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,270
So I'm chilling and relaxing.

141
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,790
And no, do not apologize for collab on day off.

142
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,590
It's actually kind of nice.

143
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,530
Do not, do not.

144
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:28,970
No, no, no.

145
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,690
It's fine.

146
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,870
It's totally fine.

147
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,590
It's nice because I get to have some time with my friends.

148
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,910
Even when I'm on my day off.

149
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:36,850
So I really like it.

150
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:37,970
Which is cool.

151
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,190
But I have been no-lifing that metaphor game a little bit.

152
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,970
Because it's actually a nice time waster.

153
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,090
It's kind of like, you know, when you play Persona 3.

154
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,970
And you're messing around in the...

155
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:48,890
Yeah.

156
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,050
It's like a dungeon grindy kind of social aspects game.

157
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:53,650
It's by Atlus.

158
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,610
It's like new Persona.

159
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,390
Oh, the metaphor game.

160
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,710
I've been wanting to play it.

161
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,370
It's really good.

162
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,730
It looks really good.

163
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,550
People have been braving about it like crazy.

164
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:05,690
Do you like it?

165
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,770
Do you think it'll be fun on stream?

166
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,090
I think it's one of those games...

167
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,730
So I played it a little bit on stream.

168
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,910
There's not like a ton of voice dialogue.

169
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,610
And I think you can get like a hundred hours plus out of it.

170
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,690
So it's like a huge commitment.

171
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,150
I was like, I could play this on stream.

172
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:23,890
But I also...

173
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,750
It's a nice game to just play when you're kind of like switching your brain off.

174
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,990
And like grinding out JRPG classes.

175
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,510
So it's like...

176
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:30,630
Yeah.

177
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,570
So I was like, I'll get it stuck in a place where I'll play it on stream.

178
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,430
Then feel like I can't play it off stream.

179
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,930
So I'm just gonna play it off stream.

180
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,030
And it'll be my chill, like, lie in bed playing it on a Steam Deck.

181
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,550
I like that.

182
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,390
I like that.

183
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,750
Yeah, it's nice.

184
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,130
Also, I played...

185
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:47,710
Okay, hold on.

186
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,290
I always feel like I have to talk.

187
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,930
But I'm just actually trying to eat.

188
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,030
Then eat.

189
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:53,890
You don't have to talk.

190
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,230
Yeah, that's fine.

191
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,070
We'll just sit here in silence.

192
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:58,570
Let's do that.

193
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,970
Mintz and I have nothing to talk about if you're not participating.

194
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,670
So we're just gonna awkwardly stare at our computer screens until you're done.

195
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,170
Yeah.

196
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,810
Hold on, Matara.

197
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,250
Let me hide my screen.

198
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,370
Hi, Gigi.

199
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,710
Hello.

200
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:14,910
Hi, Giga.

201
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,410
How was your day?

202
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,610
Good, it's been good.

203
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,250
I was just talking.

204
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,470
For the hundredth time.

205
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,870
About?

206
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,950
Just why cities are good for the thousandth time.

207
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,170
Oh yeah, I'm like an avid London defender.

208
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

209
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,230
People are like, hate London.

210
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,830
Matara is like, hate London.

211
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:41,370
I hate it because in London you'll go get a drink and it's 25 free British pounds.

212
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,230
I'm like, I've been there.

213
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:42,810
What is London?

214
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,330
I won't defend London's prices, but London itself is cool.

215
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:47,670
Yeah.

216
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,490
I legitimately thought you guys were talking about like a gacha game at first.

217
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,190
Like, what?

218
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,030
Like some sort of...

219
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,370
I was like, oh.

220
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,170
London defenders.

221
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,030
Oh, you're defending London, oh.

222
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,970
And the train system is really nicely set up.

223
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,630
You can actually live pretty far out from London and go work into London.

224
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,590
Yeah, yeah.

225
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,030
That's what I was talking about when I first got my job.

226
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,710
Isn't that the best?

227
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,330
Yeah.

228
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:20,250
You go home and it's quiet, but then during the day you go to like sensory overload town.

229
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:33,490
Yeah, I found the one problem with like commuting was that like in my first, I think two months at my new job when I was commuting into London, there was like this huge catastrophic issue with the trains.

230
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:38,510
And I went into London and it took me two and a half hours to get to work.

231
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:45,770
And then, and then like three days later, there was an issue while I was already in London and I got stuck in London until like 10pm.

232
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:54,790
And then so I got home, I got home like closer to midnight and then had to go back into work the next day at like, like get up at 7am for that.

233
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,010
And I was like, I want to die.

234
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:01,490
Yeah, I usually ended up opting for living very close to wherever I had to work for that reason.

235
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:07,770
Because like, the thing with the thing with the city is like, the trains say they're on a tight schedule.

236
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:15,590
And every 15 minutes for some stops, some stops, it's five minutes, you've got a train coming through every single time, you know, and then one train will have an issue.

237
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:22,310
And then they're like, Oh, your train to go two blocks isn't coming for 45 minutes, you know, so I would just end up walking everywhere.

238
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:28,510
So I would end up what I decided to do was I was like, I'm going to stop taking the trains for the most part, I am going to walk everywhere.

239
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,310
I'm going to do those long walks, but I'm just going to live a little closer.

240
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,590
And then just do it.

241
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,330
And I did and I was my legs were never stronger than that time.

242
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,770
That's how I know you don't have winter.

243
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,130
Oh, oh, no, it was it was there.

244
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:48,530
I would dress in like my Michelin Man looking suit of like snow pants and a huge jacket.

245
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:53,410
I have you on max and you're still a little quiet.

246
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,410
But I cannot make you louder.

247
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,170
I put you at like the loudest you can be.

248
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:57,810
I'm quiet.

249
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,950
Everyone always says I'm quiet.

250
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:08,650
Yeah, it's like the game is going to join off of me.

251
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,570
But you need to talk like once you're there's a really long cutscene.

252
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,870
Once you're done with it, we'll talk to like the little radar radar.

253
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,070
That's like you.

254
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,510
And then you join off of me.

255
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,230
Wait, do we have to pick our character first?

256
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,530
I'm not sure.

257
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,530
Oh, wait, I just showed room ID.

258
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,970
But yeah, OK, wait one second.

259
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:26,510
Let me restart.

260
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,070
Oh, yeah.

261
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:29,450
Come on.

262
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,670
I'm in the party plaza.

263
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,010
Sorry for that.

264
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,830
Let me restart the room.

265
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,650
It's because I'm not used to holding one Joy-Con.

266
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,310
Yeah, yeah.

267
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:41,830
This is new to me.

268
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,470
Oh, they have huge wiggler.

269
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,750
All aboard.

270
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,470
Oh, OK.

271
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,430
I have the game.

272
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,650
I hit start and then like snooze my switch.

273
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,170
Am I playing the game?

274
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,930
Also, games take much longer.

275
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:56,910
Oh, yeah?

276
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:57,510
Do they?

277
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,750
Yeah, there's a lot.

278
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,390
OK, there's a lot more minigames.

279
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,850
Some minigames take a long time.

280
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,610
You also have a buddy system and it takes like a longer time.

281
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,890
So I'm just letting y'all know.

282
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:07,610
OK.

283
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,710
The games take much longer.

284
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,550
OK.

285
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,010
I'm ignoring the tutorial.

286
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,590
I don't...

287
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,870
Atari, you'll have to... You'll have to lead us.

288
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,510
Earlier today I did the volcano.

289
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,050
It was fun.

290
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,090
We just did the mall.

291
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:28,010
But you guys can pick whatever map we... There's a racing map that looks really good.

292
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,830
But you can also pick whatever map we do.

293
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,990
Wait, so I can get Mario Kart and Mario Party PTSD at the same time?

294
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:34,290
Great.

295
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:42,370
Wait, how do I go to like... How do I join your game?

296
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,870
Oh, I think... OK, hold on.

297
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,410
I have to add you.

298
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:44,870
Hold on.

299
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,770
I saw the invite but it's making me watch this cutscene before I can join your game.

300
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,850
Don't forget about Paratroopa Flight School.

301
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,750
You gotta watch the cutscene for it.

302
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,710
The volcano loomed over this tropical island.

303
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:06,290
I want both Giga and Lime to rate the tweet that Mint wanted me to tweet earlier.

304
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,670
You wouldn't have gotten in trouble.

305
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:09,690
I know you.

306
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:10,710
I think I would have gotten in trouble.

307
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,650
No, you wouldn't.

308
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,110
Would you like to read it, Mint?

309
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,590
I don't have it up.

310
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:16,490
OK, OK, wait.

311
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,530
I'll read it in a second.

312
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,250
Let me just add you.

313
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,110
I want to read it for y'all.

314
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,710
Just because like...

315
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,670
My chat was like, Starup, please, do not.

316
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,370
They're just a bunch of babies.

317
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,650
You just would have gotten a bunch of bots being like, you need crypto?

318
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,750
OK, you need...

319
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,410
And then I would have gotten a bunch of fake accounts.

320
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,610
And then I would have had 400k on Twitter and like 20 likes.

321
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,090
And I would have been flagged by Twitter.

322
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,990
I was going to say, that's a free band list.

323
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,730
OK, you're right.

324
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,470
OK, wait, let me show you the tweet.

325
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,930
I don't know if it's better to show you or to read it, because it's like...

326
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:58,550
Just read it.

327
00:17:59,050 --> 00:17:59,790
I don't know.

328
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,950
I can't transfer my money.

329
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,190
You're already fumbling.

330
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,870
I can't transfer my money.

331
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,550
Was it hacked?

332
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,070
Help.

333
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,170
I want this on a shirt.

334
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,250
I need help with my essay.

335
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,070
I need art commission.

336
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,210
Can someone draw this for me?

337
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,530
Crypto, wallet, bitcoin, mint.

338
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,550
You're NFTs.

339
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,510
I need a sugar mommy.

340
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,570
My IG was hacked.

341
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,630
Giveaway Gmail hacked.

342
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,470
Instagram disabled.

343
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,290
Twitter hacked.

344
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,290
Help sugar daddy cry.

345
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,450
Like this tweet.

346
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,210
Follow me.

347
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,510
Tag three friends in the comments.

348
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,130
It's like a summoning circle for bots.

349
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,110
Those are always funny.

350
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,430
Yeah, it's just a summoning circle for the bots.

351
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,150
Guys, please, I just joined WME.

352
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,630
Oh my god, you are being so sensitive right now.

353
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,150
They've seen your worst.

354
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,710
They've seen your worst.

355
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:49,890
Yeah, it's sometimes like, you know, when I'm streaming for like a sponsored stream or something...

356
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:53,070
and someone's like, can you do this or say this stuff during a sponsor?

357
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,490
It's like, if they didn't know what I'm like, then that's on them.

358
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,170
Yeah, exactly.

359
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,050
If they emailed me for me and they didn't know what I was like...

360
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,490
I'm being a little voyeur.

361
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,730
Okay, there we go.

362
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,090
I just don't want to summon all the bots, okay?

363
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:12,770
I'm sorry.

364
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,370
Wait, how do I do your invite?

365
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:14,930
Oh my gosh.

366
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,130
Wait, I just took a photo of a guy without his permission.

367
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,070
Okay, so you have to go...

368
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,730
before the hot air balloon.

369
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:23,290
Before?

370
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,150
When you're in like the big city.

371
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,930
To your right, there's like a little teal thing with a radar on it.

372
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,010
You have to click on it because it connects you to the internet.

373
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,350
And then from it, you join friend room.

374
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,050
I'm just watching Bowser freak out right now.

375
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,550
The game is like showing me all this story and lore and stuff.

376
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,730
I have not taken in a single part of it.

377
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,290
Wait, guys, I know I always play Wario, but they added Shy Guy and I'm a Shy Guy main.

378
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,930
See, that's what I had to switch to.

379
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,110
I had to switch to Toad.

380
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,090
Yeah.

381
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,430
I just play Yoshi because he's cute.

382
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:55,950
Forever Bowser.

383
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,730
I have to be him.

384
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,570
I have to do it.

385
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,630
I'm never not gonna be Bowser anymore.

386
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:01,690
This is it.

387
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,490
Sorry, Wario.

388
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:03,890
My little man.

389
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,370
I have a new ironically chubby little man.

390
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,330
I wouldn't say little.

391
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,870
Yeah, he's a big boy.

392
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,870
Yeah, he's a big boy.

393
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,990
Oh, so it's the hot... Okay, the antenna thing.

394
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:15,390
Okay, okay.

395
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,450
Okay, I'm going into the hot air balloon.

396
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,370
I swear to God, please...

397
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,390
Could not join.

398
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,330
Okay.

399
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,770
Okay, connect.

400
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,790
Because I have to pick my character, hold on.

401
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,490
Yeah.

402
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,910
I'm gonna get a little blanket because I'm still in my workout gear.

403
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,630
And now that I'm not working out, I'm actually getting kind of cold.

404
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:37,830
I'm here.

405
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:38,330
Hello.

406
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,130
Oh, I'm pushing.

407
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:40,730
I can push you.

408
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,690
Let me in.

409
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,490
I'm trying.

410
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,770
Wow, party plaza is so cool.

411
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,290
Could not join.

412
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,530
Could not join?

413
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,670
Do I have to hang on this hot air balloon before I try to join?

414
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:02,150
When she sent the invite to me, it just said do you want to join Tara's room and let me join.

415
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,090
I didn't have to go into the hot air balloon at all?

416
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,070
Nope.

417
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,770
I accidentally clicked the hot air balloon.

418
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,390
Give me a second.

419
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,650
Let me make sure I'm connected.

420
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,230
Can you see me, Matara?

421
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,690
Do I have to manually enable the online for this fucking game?

422
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,370
Alright, hold on.

423
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,510
I think that's what it is, yeah.

424
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,470
Hold on.

425
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,350
Okay, yeah, there we go.

426
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,470
Am I smacking you?

427
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,090
Am I smacking you?

428
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,510
Am I smacking you?

429
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,410
Am I smacking you?

430
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,570
Oh, how do you smack?

431
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:30,930
Am I smacking you?

432
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,390
Am I smacking you?

433
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:31,850
How do you smack?

434
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,390
How do you smack?

435
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,570
Am I smacking you?

436
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,310
No, you're missing.

437
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,790
You're missing.

438
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,150
Miss.

439
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,690
Miss.

440
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,170
You're missing.

441
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,450
I don't know how to smack.

442
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,350
Yeah, how do you smack?

443
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,410
Come here, I'll show you, baby.

444
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:40,990
No, you won't.

445
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,810
This is like what Mint and I look like when we walk down the street.

446
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,050
Let's gang up on her.

447
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,910
Gang up on her.

448
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,570
Ah, no!

449
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,550
Not the... I knew the small women were bullies.

450
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,750
How do you smack?

451
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:07,690
No, I was just, like, rolling and saying that I'm smacking you.

452
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,930
I'm not actually smacking you.

453
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,590
Can I join now, Nintendo?

454
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,150
Nintendo, please, let Lime join.

455
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:14,910
Let me in.

456
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,850
You're the smart one.

457
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,370
Let me in.

458
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,630
It's over for you.

459
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,290
It just says no rooms can be found.

460
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,030
What?

461
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,910
Hold on, let me try to enter this.

462
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:26,770
Europe.

463
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:30,890
Oh, I accidentally showed the room ID again, because I clicked the wrong thing.

464
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,690
Should we leave?

465
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,930
I think people can join unless they're my friend, though, but I guess we're gonna find out.

466
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,970
Oh, wait, you're showing up now.

467
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,570
It wouldn't let me do it through the invite, but let me just do it really quick.

468
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,690
Lime's joined, yes!

469
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,830
This is the real... Wait, if you're the real Limes, prove it.

470
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,650
Prove you're the real Limes.

471
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,050
Yeah, prove you're the real Limealicious.

472
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:48,570
Yeah.

473
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,570
Damn girl, you need sun.

474
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,570
Oh my god, it's her.

475
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,690
The real one.

476
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,150
Alright, into the hot air balloon we go, ladies.

477
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,930
It's time, it's time.

478
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,770
It's not Limealicious, it's Limealicious.

479
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,190
Limealicious.

480
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,530
So where do y'all wanna go?

481
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,030
Wait, what's this over here, over there?

482
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,570
Oh, I unlocked a new map.

483
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,210
Oh, okay.

484
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,070
Do you wanna do it then, since it's a new map?

485
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,010
Take a look at all the maps before you decide.

486
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,810
Western land.

487
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,490
That is really cute actually, though.

488
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,770
I love trains.

489
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,350
I love trains.

490
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,850
You said you did the volcano in the mall?

491
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,430
Yeah, volcano in the mall.

492
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,210
I wanted to do the mall.

493
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,570
Coconut mall.

494
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,370
Party rules or pro rules?

495
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,210
Let's do...

496
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:48,490
What are we?

497
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:50,570
Well...

498
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:52,790
I mean...

499
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,970
I've never... I think we're doing party rules, right?

500
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,870
I think we're all professionals here.

501
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,110
Yeah, we're gamers.

502
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:03,390
I think it's just basically like what you get rewarded stars for.

503
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,590
Like, party rules is more like arbitrary shit, like landed on the most items.

504
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,650
Party rules is like, you won the most minigames.

505
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:10,190
Yeah.

506
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,790
It's fun, it's fun to...

507
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,490
The only one I didn't do was the...

508
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,170
I only did the mall and the volcano.

509
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,250
But I'd be really down for the western land or the roller racing.

510
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,670
I think it'd be good for western.

511
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,970
Because if you...

512
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:28,010
If other people have to unlock it, you know, like it means maybe less people have seen it yet.

513
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,810
World's first western land run.

514
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,370
World's first.

515
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,050
Yes.

516
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,070
World's first, yeah.

517
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,610
Western land run.

518
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,670
So, okay, very quickly.

519
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,750
The first time I played this, it did not take 90 minutes.

520
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,150
It took like a little over 2 hours.

521
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,950
The second time we played this, it was actually almost an hour and a half.

522
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,810
This game is a little longer, but how do y'all feel about 15 turns?

523
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:50,870
Or do you want to keep it at 10?

524
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,150
What do y'all...

525
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:52,710
I'm down for anything.

526
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:56,090
There's a lot more comebacks in this game than the previous one.

527
00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:01,270
I would say like 10 is fine for the first one so we can see like how long each one is for us specifically.

528
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,570
Genuinely, in this game, if you do 15 rounds, I think you can come back a lot easier.

529
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,490
There's a lot of gold multipliers.

530
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,870
There's a lot of ways you can like buy two stars at once.

531
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,450
So you actually could come back.

532
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,430
Okay.

533
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:14,370
Alright.

534
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,870
Let's go!

535
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:16,870
Betrayal!

536
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,470
Let's go!

537
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,130
I love being betrayed by my small women.

538
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:20,350
Betrayal.

539
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,050
I don't think we're in luck today.

540
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,630
Has everybody here met?

541
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,830
Oh, wait.

542
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,370
I must be in luck today.

543
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,850
Are you doing your intro now?

544
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:30,230
Has everybody here met before?

545
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,270
I think so.

546
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,110
Yeah?

547
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,490
I think so.

548
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,790
I don't know who any of you guys are.

549
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,190
Should we do a small intro?

550
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,870
We could've.

551
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:41,530
We should've, maybe.

552
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,410
Mint, you also need to speak louder.

553
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,070
Please.

554
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,390
Me speak louder?

555
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:45,910
Eat the mic.

556
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,270
Eat the microphone.

557
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,470
What was that?

558
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:59,730
I just had a collab with people who were not say so.

559
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,970
I thought this was like the wholesome collab.

560
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:07,370
I ate fuzz all over the dust on top of my mic.

561
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:13,470
If there's anything I'm famously known for, it's definitely for being wholesome.

562
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,390
It's lying maliciously.

563
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:15,590
Yeah.

564
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,250
I only say nice things in my streams.

565
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,590
Yeah.

566
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,190
I've never been mean, ever.

567
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,850
The milk's so weak!

568
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:27,390
No!

569
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,750
No, no, Mint!

570
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:30,150
No!

571
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:32,910
Wow, Matara.

572
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,130
How could you know?

573
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,950
Mint is at her loudest.

574
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,070
Mint does not get any louder.

575
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:37,870
Hi!

576
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,670
Okay, I'll turn myself up, but I'm going to be too loud on my stream, I think.

577
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,110
Turn yourself down a bit, then.

578
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,690
What do you mean?

579
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,090
Matara, okay.

580
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:50,070
How about you turn everyone else down?

581
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:50,510
I did.

582
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,070
Leave Mint where she is and then turn it up on OBS.

583
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,450
The problem is, Mint is still quiet.

584
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,430
OBS is maxed.

585
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,110
Mint is maxed.

586
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:58,630
Okay.

587
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,870
Am I louder now?

588
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,050
I'm in the red on my stream.

589
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:05,610
Really?

590
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:05,970
Okay.

591
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:12,010
If you go into voice and video, Mint, do you have like automatic game control enabled or anything like that?

592
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,790
Let me check.

593
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,590
I don't think so, but I'll double check.

594
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,510
I actually have her on 200 Discord.

595
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,590
I promise you, I would not lie about this.

596
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:21,870
No, I don't have any.

597
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,090
I'm a trooper.

598
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:23,590
It's okay.

599
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,850
Mint, just remember every time you speak, just speak louder.

600
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:28,110
Okay!

601
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,690
You can admit, you guys have collabed before?

602
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,010
No.

603
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,530
Introduce yourselves please.

604
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,250
I should have done that.

605
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,610
Sorry, I'm such a bad host and organizer.

606
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,350
I'm so sorry.

607
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:40,630
Are you ready?

608
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,690
Mint, you go first because you're stinky.

609
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:43,470
Okay.

610
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,710
Okay!

611
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:45,990
Here we go!

612
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,390
Hello!

613
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,870
My name is Mint Phantom!

614
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,570
I'm playing as Toad!

615
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,910
Nice to meet you!

616
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:55,570
Oh, actually...

617
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,530
Do you want Mint?

618
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:00,330
I might have to have you do an intro again because Limes, I think you should do the intro first.

619
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,210
Because you're the first one on the board.

620
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,710
How do y'all feel about that?

621
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:10,070
Or, you know, Mint doesn't have to do it again because her voice is gonna fucking collapse.

622
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,370
Where are my stickers?

623
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,230
Can I be a sticker?

624
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,090
Can I use stickers?

625
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,110
Yeah, you can, you can.

626
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,470
If you press down.

627
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:20,450
There you go.

628
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,530
Oh, maybe not while I'm playing.

629
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,650
Where's the mist?

630
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,090
There's no... They took away my sticker.

631
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,230
This is automatically...

632
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,010
They took away mine too!

633
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,030
Oh my god, so bad.

634
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,270
But there's a sticker store.

635
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:39,350
Okay, well, maybe Nintendo are selling back my lewd Yoshi sticker, so whatever.

636
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,670
Anyway, my name is Limelicious.

637
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,310
I'm also known as Limu.

638
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:50,170
I haven't figured out which one of those I'm known by more often, so it kind of makes making new accounts kind of annoying.

639
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:55,710
But, anyway, I play video games and I'm friends with all of these people because they're nice.

640
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:56,830
And I like Yoshi.

641
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,450
Friends?

642
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,150
We're not friends.

643
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,110
Okay.

644
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,210
Give it time, give it time.

645
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,550
See what happens.

646
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,110
Why?

647
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,750
Choose my content.

648
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:11,950
I always roll high on the turn order and then choose roll twos for the rest of the game.

649
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,230
You got a warp box!

650
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,010
Worth it!

651
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,330
Wow, okay.

652
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:19,890
Okay!

653
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:23,030
And unfortunately I always invite her on her day off.

654
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,090
Every time.

655
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:30,310
Hi everybody, Matara Kanvi Shoujo here, Double D's triple threat.

656
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,690
You might know me.

657
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,550
And you might not.

658
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,010
Welcome.

659
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:39,570
This is my third lobby that I've organized today of this game.

660
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,630
I had five initially but now we're down to four.

661
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,770
So I am a Mario Party expert.

662
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,190
Girl, I'm an organizer.

663
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:47,950
I'm an influencer.

664
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,970
Oh my god.

665
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,670
I do what I do.

666
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,130
You must love this game.

667
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:56,710
I just wanted to bring people together for it because I know everyone's too shy to organize stuff.

668
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,630
So I was like, you know what, I'll just organize it.

669
00:29:58,990 --> 00:29:59,950
Why is that?

670
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,470
What do you mean?

671
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:01,970
Why are they like that?

672
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,890
Why is everyone so shy?

673
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,610
You just gotta DM and be like, video game.

674
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:07,850
Video game.

675
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,530
I'm honestly really happy to DM people for video games.

676
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:17,250
I just don't DM people for Mario Party because I'm not into cell smarts.

677
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,930
I only DM when you guys make me.

678
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,310
Maybe after this game.

679
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,790
Alright, who are you, Toad?

680
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,730
I'm Toad.

681
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,410
Nice, I like that.

682
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:30,790
Yeah.

683
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,750
Kinda looks like you.

684
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,930
No, it doesn't.

685
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,790
What's wrong with you?

686
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,630
Okay, I can only go one way.

687
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,250
See, that is you.

688
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,610
You guys sound the same.

689
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,950
Alright, what about this one?

690
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:51,330
Hey guys, my name is Tiga from VCO, so I'm really smart and I'm 6 feet tall.

691
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,690
And I really like Shy Guy.

692
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,530
Shy Guy?

693
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,950
What's the average height in this collab?

694
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,850
You a shy guy?

695
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:01,830
Okay, wait, if you take 3 people that are 4'10 and 1 person, that's 6 feet.

696
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,490
What does it even help you?

697
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,470
Not that tall.

698
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:06,790
Not very.

699
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:08,510
Not really.

700
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,230
181 is like 5'11.

701
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,850
If you put 3 4' people on top of each other, that's not 6 feet.

702
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,110
Hey, you guys are taller than me.

703
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:18,390
Together.

704
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,190
Very good.

705
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,510
Sneak in math.

706
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:28,330
Okay, thank god I'm not last on the intelligence scale.

707
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,570
At least there's Mint down there with me.

708
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:31,950
Wait, what are you... That's what you said.

709
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,250
You were like, if you stacked us, then it would be... which is taller.

710
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:36,770
Is that what you said?

711
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:37,830
Am I hearing things?

712
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,830
No, I think you're hearing my voice.

713
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,050
Yeah, I meant the average.

714
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,370
Like, you know when you add...

715
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,910
Oh, thank god.

716
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,630
On this tier list, I'm 3rd intelligence, not 4th.

717
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,730
Says you.

718
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,330
That was an intelligence problem.

719
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,710
That was a hearing problem.

720
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:59,630
Oh my god.

721
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,630
Giga already from the start getting lucky.

722
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,470
Oh my god.

723
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,350
I'm trying to...

724
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,310
That's crazy.

725
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,310
Oh my god.

726
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,390
Swap mirror?

727
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:17,310
I think today is the first day I've ever heard what a shy guy sounds like.

728
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,330
Apparently it was like...

729
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,350
Making car noises, you know what I mean?

730
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,230
Yeah, it's cute.

731
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:35,030
I need to figure out how to change the settings on my capture card because the colors are so fucking blown out right now that Bowser is almost red.

732
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:38,030
I need to go tweak the gamma or something.

733
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,370
Sync shots?

734
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,550
Sync jump shots.

735
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:45,890
Wait, how are you throwing the ball?

736
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,730
There's instructions on the side.

737
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,490
I know, but I don't understand.

738
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,870
Do I have to have two of them?

739
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:52,450
I'm confused.

740
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,070
Jump and jump shot.

741
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,510
Oh, you can only get into one at a time?

742
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,490
Oh, that sucks.

743
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,450
Oh my god, I might be a pro.

744
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,950
Oh, this is practice.

745
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:04,970
Oh shit.

746
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,530
Hold on, can I at least try to get one?

747
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,510
Okay, I hate...

748
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,470
Limes is the biggest gamer.

749
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,590
Ready up, Bowser.

750
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,730
Can I at least get one in before we start?

751
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:22,190
No.

752
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:23,390
No.

753
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:23,930
Screw you.

754
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,610
Watch, I'll get last.

755
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,270
I'm gonna lock in.

756
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,050
What?!

757
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,430
Oh, your balls block my balls, so to speak.

758
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,170
Oh my god, lag.

759
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,090
That's my very ball.

760
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,650
Blocking you, I'm so sorry.

761
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:47,930
I'm balling out.

762
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,150
My bad.

763
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:49,950
Okay, you know what?

764
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,350
I'm just gonna shoot and hope for the best.

765
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:55,270
Brother, I am locked the fuck in.

766
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:55,850
Yeah, you are.

767
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,510
Oh my god.

768
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,310
How do you get the middle rows?

769
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,130
Oh my god.

770
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,710
You have to like get it to go in the middle of the big ones.

771
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,330
Oh no, I'm losing.

772
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:05,670
Oh no.

773
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,550
I'm losing control of my body.

774
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,490
Very nice.

775
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,430
I fucking locked in so hard, dude.

776
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,970
Oh my god, how did you do that?

777
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:14,670
Once you get the rhythm for a particular row, it's pretty great.

778
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,650
Yeah, I only had the top row.

779
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:23,590
Yeah, I didn't get the second row in practice, so I was like locking in on the first row, but then the balls were all in there.

780
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,310
And it was like, ah, I see.

781
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,290
Sorry, those were mine.

782
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,110
It's okay, I didn't get last.

783
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,570
It's the first turn, girl.

784
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:34,870
Watch yourself.

785
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,990
I'm in third place, baby.

786
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,970
Look at the Goomba Hut.

787
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:39,810
It's my little man!

788
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:46,070
Okay, if you go to him first, you get money, and then you have like an easier way of winning his game.

789
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:51,270
He's gonna like hate you though, because you abandoned him.

790
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,850
I didn't.

791
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:53,990
Yes, you did.

792
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,250
Why would you do that to him?

793
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,050
You also did that to him.

794
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,610
No.

795
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:01,830
Betrayal.

796
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:02,750
Oh my god.

797
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:03,890
Wade.

798
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:05,650
Wait.

799
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,030
Let's have a look at the store.

800
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,750
Wait, where's the store?

801
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:11,750
Okay, it's there.

802
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,350
Cadmath.

803
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:16,510
Unlike me.

804
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,230
God, now I wanna see what the stickers are being sold for.

805
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,110
I know, right?

806
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,090
We gotta win.

807
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,190
Well, actually, Matari, you probably have a lot of money.

808
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,130
You can probably buy a bunch.

809
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,490
Yeah, I could.

810
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:30,450
Limes, come here.

811
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,430
Come to my side.

812
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,230
Go away from stinky Matari.

813
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:34,890
Come to our side.

814
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:35,570
We're cooler.

815
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:38,150
So everyone but Matari is going in this direction?

816
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:38,750
Yeah.

817
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,090
Damn.

818
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,410
I told y'all I was gonna get bullied by the short women.

819
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,030
Skeleton T.

820
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:50,990
Yeah.

821
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,010
Actually, I don't know where the star is at all though.

822
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,290
Maybe Matari is going...

823
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,610
Look, look, look what I can do still!

824
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,450
Oh, you got it.

825
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,490
It's not quite as sus, but we're almost there.

826
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,730
Wait, how'd you get that?

827
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,650
Where'd you get it from?

828
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,510
I hit right.

829
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:06,610
Right.

830
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,690
Oh yeah, you have the unique Yoshi ones.

831
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:12,730
Oh, that's right.

832
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,550
These are Yoshi only.

833
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:17,670
I see.

834
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:18,630
Okay, okay, okay.

835
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,810
I missed the old one.

836
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,030
This is fine, this is fine.

837
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,410
I did that on purpose, I did that on purpose.

838
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,070
He has to fight Yoshi.

839
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,250
Half the coin.

840
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,230
Alright, you girls are gonna step into my coins, right?

841
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,690
Why would you waste your money?

842
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:36,530
Maybe.

843
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,510
My love.

844
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,090
Oh, you get half of our coins.

845
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:44,490
Sorry, I just came from a toxic lobby where everybody was being a little bit sexual.

846
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,350
You're holding on to some anger.

847
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry.

848
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,150
What are you doing on back, Mat?

849
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,090
I know, are you okay?

850
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:51,150
What?

851
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,650
You're like up here, Matari.

852
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,390
You need to come like down here, okay?

853
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,170
I know, I know.

854
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:58,690
I'm sorry.

855
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:58,810
I'm sorry.

856
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,670
You need to come to our level.

857
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,450
No, we're chilling.

858
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:01,270
We're chilling.

859
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,630
You seem a little tense.

860
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,830
I'm excited for this.

861
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:05,310
Not me.

862
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,790
I'm ready to fuck shit up.

863
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,750
I'm ready to kill.

864
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,890
I just went crazy in basketball, alright?

865
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:11,470
I'm ready.

866
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,570
Oh, what's happening?

867
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,170
Howdy, Toad.

868
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,690
Climb aboard me and I'll get you to the next station.

869
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,670
In the blink of an eye.

870
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,850
It is a grandpa train.

871
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:23,930
Does this cost money?

872
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,610
In fact, I can even go in reverse.

873
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,670
New tech.

874
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,790
Oh, it does cost money.

875
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,650
Can you check the board before you commit?

876
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,310
You can.

877
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,090
It does allow you, yeah.

878
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,950
Okay, that's nice at least.

879
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:40,250
I was gonna say, I have no idea what the board looks like.

880
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:46,650
We're actually headed... Actually, only Matara is going the wrong way.

881
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,350
I know, I know.

882
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:53,250
Listen, it's because any of you can get the star and then the star is gonna move and then I'm gonna be in front of the star.

883
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,130
Okay.

884
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,310
Watashi wa star.

885
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:56,970
Watashi wa star.

886
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,670
Won't be needing a ride?

887
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,490
Well, I reckon I'll do.

888
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:02,950
Take care now, Toad.

889
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,210
Why aren't you hitting the ride?

890
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,420
Because I don't need to.

891
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:07,890
You suck.

892
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,490
She does this thing, Matara, where she looks at the map.

893
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,950
Why would you do the wrong thing like me?

894
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,070
How much money do I have?

895
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,270
Planning thing.

896
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,530
Hold on, do I have a little bit before my turn?

897
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,930
I'm gonna go look at the settings on my capture card.

898
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,130
Let's go see.

899
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,990
Oh, I can move the star.

900
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,670
Oh my gosh, wait, if I get this and then it is in front of Matara...

901
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,190
Yeah, that would be great.

902
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,210
Do that, do that.

903
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:30,710
Okay, I will.

904
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,050
Thank you.

905
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,150
You're so sweet.

906
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,070
You're such an angel.

907
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:34,510
I know.

908
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,750
That's why you invited me.

909
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:41,070
With the lips of an angel...

910
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:41,470
Uh-oh.

911
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,310
What's gonna happen?

912
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:43,770
Metal gear.

913
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:44,210
Let's find out.

914
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,870
Oh, oh no.

915
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,130
I think I'm gonna die.

916
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:49,430
She's already dead.

917
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,110
Nice try.

918
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,870
He's fucking dead.

919
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,950
I just got run over by a train.

920
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:56,610
Wait, where am I?

921
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,830
Wait, are you back at the start?

922
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,390
Yes, I'm back at the start.

923
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:06,110
Oh, Mint, have you tried looking at a map when you're walking?

924
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,530
Have you tried looking at a map, Mint?

925
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,630
You're going the wrong way.

926
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,910
You're going the wrong way.

927
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,910
Nobody is getting this star now.

928
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,370
Witness me.

929
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,330
Witness me.

930
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,290
No,

931
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,030
I don't have coins.

932
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,570
I don't have any money.

933
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,550
Yeah, you do.

934
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,430
But then I can't be doing all this.

935
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,850
Oh wait, you actually...

936
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,770
It would have been so funny if you went left.

937
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:37,450
Wait, how many?

938
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,890
Oh my god, wait, she has a cow!

939
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,650
Look at that horse.

940
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,270
Mint clutches the star.

941
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,890
I think we need a Giga Keith emote as well.

942
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,350
It's about time.

943
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,550
We're gonna make out.

944
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,930
You want all this body?

945
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,850
Imagine making out with Shy Guy.

946
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,030
That's what you're asking for, Matara.

947
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,930
I mean, that's my favorite.

948
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,430
His open...

949
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,110
I can't even say it.

950
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,070
Is this the Say So collab?

951
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:12,630
Do we have to be?

952
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,770
You know, what do you want to say?

953
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,630
His open, wanting mouth, Matara.

954
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,270
It's right there.

955
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:20,750
Look at it.

956
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,230
Look at it.

957
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,750
I see three holes.

958
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,870
You were like, wait, can I say this?

959
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:36,230
I thought it was gonna be something so much worse.

960
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,430
No, no, no.

961
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,930
This is very normal for the book.

962
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:43,690
Mint reads books on stream about this, so you're fine.

963
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,750
I don't read them on stream.

964
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:45,750
Oh, what are you doing to me?

965
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,270
Toad will trade all of their coins.

966
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:59,030
Wait, why is it the other way around?

967
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,430
No, no, no.

968
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,190
You get it, you get it.

969
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,630
Look, you're rich now.

970
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:03,970
Oh, I have more money!

971
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,610
Yeah, you're doing great.

972
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,770
You're doing wonderfully.

973
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:07,790
You must be nice.

974
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:08,910
I fucking hate this game.

975
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,050
Gosh darn it.

976
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:22,070
Also speaking of good shy men, I mean, all my ex-husbands that were tragically eaten...

977
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,290
have been good shy men.

978
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,650
Wait, what'd you say?

979
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:25,730
I'm coming for him.

980
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:27,370
What'd you say?

981
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,030
What's your type?

982
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,970
Yeah, good shy men.

983
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:31,970
Flicked coins.

984
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,750
Oh, you can die.

985
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,830
Thanks for checking for us.

986
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,630
I really appreciate that.

987
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,510
But you come back.

988
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:43,990
Wait, can I... I can actually intrude on your seesaw.

989
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:44,590
That's great.

990
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

991
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:45,750
You can do this.

992
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,790
Oh, I keep thinking of you.

993
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:53,270
No, you... I don't like this one.

994
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:53,850
You can die.

995
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:56,330
Oh, wait, did I click on the stars?

996
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,690
I think I'm good.

997
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,110
I don't understand.

998
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:08,530
Out of the way.

999
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:09,330
Out of the way, woman.

1000
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:09,910
Out of the way.

1001
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:16,590
These are giving me, like, no stars.

1002
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,010
Well, take my money.

1003
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,190
I'm gonna get my money back.

1004
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,470
Jump on my side.

1005
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,270
Yeah, jump on the side.

1006
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,590
Wait, what the freak?

1007
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,890
You can collect them when you're being lifted back onto the ground.

1008
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,810
Yeah, you can collect them when you're being lifted.

1009
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,690
Oh my god.

1010
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:35,590
Please.

1011
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,030
Please.

1012
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,170
Please.

1013
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:41,390
Minto Gaming.

1014
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,850
Limes, what's going on with us?

1015
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,230
Can we get some Limes right now?

1016
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:45,430
For energy, please.

1017
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:50,590
Mint, I saw you power ball, like, at the end there.

1018
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,550
You went crazy.

1019
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:56,910
We're all doing well.

1020
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,550
We all sing.

1021
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:06,110
I mean, I was doing okay until someone stole my fucking coins in an event I wasn't even involved in.

1022
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:08,290
She lost more coins, girl.

1023
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:10,450
I got ran over by a train.

1024
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,550
I think we all have had a bad day, okay?

1025
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:16,350
Cause you had a bad day.

1026
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:25,270
You thought Lime and Mint were the same person?

1027
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,650
I swear to god, they see green.

1028
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:36,070
If I was green, would you also think I'm the same person?

1029
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:38,570
Probably.

1030
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:41,970
You'd have to get short hair.

1031
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,130
You're way more annoying.

1032
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,530
A fairly good chance that I'll go to someone that's helpful for me.

1033
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:50,010
And then there's also a chance that something terrible will happen.

1034
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,890
Wait, maybe it's actually good for you.

1035
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,810
I think it is good for me.

1036
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,230
Wait, you're not teleporting me back.

1037
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:58,190
You're coming with me.

1038
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:58,590
Hey, girl.

1039
00:43:59,090 --> 00:43:59,850
Hey, what's up?

1040
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:05,810
Is it still 20 coins for a star?

1041
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,050
Fuck yeah, it's still 20.

1042
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:08,790
You're doing amazing, sweetie.

1043
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:09,850
Thanks.

1044
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:11,910
You're doing great.

1045
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:15,110
Not every game that you play, you're gonna win at.

1046
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:15,930
But that's okay.

1047
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,350
I don't think I've ever won Mario Party.

1048
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:19,410
I hate this game.

1049
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,030
Really?

1050
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:21,330
Really?

1051
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:22,410
Really?

1052
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:23,530
Really?

1053
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:31,330
There was one time when I almost did and then the game gave like three stars to someone for some nonsense and I was like...

1054
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,490
Yeah, it does that.

1055
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,070
Tara is thinking.

1056
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:37,770
I'm trapped.

1057
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:38,670
I'm trapped.

1058
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:42,390
You put that there because I'm coming around the bend, aren't you?

1059
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:43,310
You did that.

1060
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,150
She's coming around.

1061
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:47,490
I did that.

1062
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:48,510
You did that on purpose.

1063
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,870
People are saying you don't play to win, you play to have fun.

1064
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:51,430
Negative.

1065
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,190
I play to win.

1066
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:53,610
Negative.

1067
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:56,150
It's not enough that I win, others must lose.

1068
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:59,910
Giga, you stole that vote from me because you joined before me, you jerk.

1069
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:00,530
Huh?

1070
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:01,350
Sorry, before we sang.

1071
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:09,050
No, I was saying I actually have made peace with Mario Party and I just play to mess around with the minigames.

1072
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,310
You know when you play Among Us?

1073
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:19,210
I've decided I won't play Among Us anymore, but if I did have to play Among Us, I'd literally just disassociate and play the minigames.

1074
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:20,350
That's fair.

1075
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:22,570
It's not fun.

1076
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:25,290
For the gate, do I need a ring?

1077
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:26,790
Oh yeah, I do need a ring.

1078
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:27,190
Shit.

1079
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:27,970
So it's gonna be here.

1080
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:28,910
A what what?

1081
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:30,650
I need a key.

1082
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:31,830
When I said ring I meant...

1083
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:32,990
Yeah, she meant key.

1084
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:34,250
A ring.

1085
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:36,070
I feel like I should've put a key in it.

1086
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:39,070
Yeah, that's the lyric.

1087
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:42,490
One of you get close to the key.

1088
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:42,950
Do it.

1089
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:44,670
Warp with me.

1090
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:45,390
I dare you.

1091
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,610
It would be so funny.

1092
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,410
Wow, I love being here.

1093
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:54,810
The little fist.

1094
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:56,390
He has little Arthur fist.

1095
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:58,850
Okay, nobody's close.

1096
00:45:58,970 --> 00:45:59,450
Okay, good.

1097
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,330
Here I go.

1098
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:06,550
Make it good, make it good.

1099
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,250
Oh, that's my lucky number.

1100
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,130
What is that?

1101
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:16,710
A creepy.

1102
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,230
I love you so much, you know that?

1103
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:19,970
Have I told you?

1104
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:21,170
What?

1105
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:21,690
What'd you say?

1106
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:23,850
Have I told you how great you are and how much I love you?

1107
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:26,350
I just wanna make sure you don't forget about that.

1108
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,530
Why are you telling me this?

1109
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:29,230
Because I care.

1110
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:30,390
About what?

1111
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,130
About your feelings.

1112
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,340
It's time.

1113
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,800
The rich just get richer.

1114
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,160
He's going.

1115
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,320
The rich get richer.

1116
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,940
Wait, Giga is only 16 coins.

1117
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:45,540
You're the richest.

1118
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,740
No, no, she has a star.

1119
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,960
And she's about to get like 13 more coins.

1120
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:50,760
Oh my god!

1121
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,580
My best man.

1122
00:46:58,840 --> 00:46:59,860
Out of my way.

1123
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:00,580
He's zooming.

1124
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,300
He really is zooming.

1125
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,940
Oh, you should hitch that ride.

1126
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:04,320
Maybe.

1127
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:04,840
Actually...

1128
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,260
Yeah, you should.

1129
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,360
Catch a ride.

1130
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,220
Actually, don't.

1131
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,600
This is so cute when you're thinking.

1132
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,700
I know, the little shy guy thinks he's so cute.

1133
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,240
I can't because then I would skip the milk barrel.

1134
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,260
I gotta go.

1135
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,600
You gotta get the milk.

1136
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,760
Yeah, you gotta go.

1137
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,960
I'm gonna be so full.

1138
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,840
I'm gonna be so full.

1139
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,540
Of milk.

1140
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,320
I'm gonna be so full of milk.

1141
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:36,080
Last time I heard someone being full of milk, they said they were sloshy.

1142
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,240
It was in the book.

1143
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,760
Is there something like that in your book?

1144
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,580
Yeah, it was in the book.

1145
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,500
I don't know if the girls know about that book.

1146
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,700
They'll learn someday.

1147
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,700
Wait, you have to...

1148
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,340
I'm just bouncing on top of you.

1149
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,100
Don't bounce on top of me.

1150
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,140
That looked awful.

1151
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,020
So you have to avoid the spikes.

1152
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:03,800
Okay, got it.

1153
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,680
I feel like me having a big hitbox is actually bad for me.

1154
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,480
I feel like this is not my game with the big hitbox.

1155
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,920
It's actually not good.

1156
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,800
You wanted to be a big man.

1157
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:20,120
I wanna be a big, strong, sexy man.

1158
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:33,510
I couldn't get out.

1159
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:35,010
Oh man!

1160
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:37,530
Oh my god!

1161
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:42,810
Glorious.

1162
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:44,190
You are gone.

1163
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:47,190
I don't like your big legs.

1164
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,830
I'm a big, strong, sexy muscle man.

1165
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,250
Cool coins just give me nothing.

1166
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,390
New turn.

1167
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:57,790
Wait, he's gonna leave.

1168
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:59,150
Matari, you gotta get to him.

1169
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:00,630
Oh, do my bad.

1170
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:01,990
You're a man.

1171
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:02,990
I'm a man.

1172
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:05,070
Wait, I don't even know where he is on the board.

1173
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:05,570
Whoopsies.

1174
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,310
I didn't even look.

1175
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:08,090
It's okay.

1176
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,190
I'm gonna hit my first good dice block.

1177
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:10,790
Here we go.

1178
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:11,150
You ready?

1179
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:11,310
Do it.

1180
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:11,790
Do it.

1181
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:13,270
Lucky number.

1182
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:17,130
Oh my god.

1183
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:17,730
Not red.

1184
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:18,730
Not red.

1185
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:19,370
Nice.

1186
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:21,550
I think that was pretty lucky.

1187
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:25,490
Where are you gonna go?

1188
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:27,610
Oh, sorry.

1189
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:31,350
I was thanking people for being very kind and sweet.

1190
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:37,890
Can I?

1191
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:39,470
Warp.

1192
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:40,150
Warp.

1193
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:40,590
Warp.

1194
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:41,570
Warp.

1195
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:41,990
Warp.

1196
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:42,730
Warp.

1197
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:42,750
Warp.

1198
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:43,370
Warp.

1199
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,770
It would be really funny if I switched with Giga.

1200
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:46,570
Or me.

1201
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:50,190
It would be less funny if I switched with you.

1202
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:50,850
But you know what?

1203
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:52,110
You know what?

1204
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:54,210
I live for the meme.

1205
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:55,410
For the joke.

1206
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:56,490
Alright, everybody?

1207
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,470
Do you believe in miracles?

1208
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:02,310
Warp.

1209
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:03,010
Warp.

1210
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:03,530
Warp.

1211
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:04,610
I'm closing my eyes.

1212
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:05,210
I'm closing my eyes.

1213
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:06,650
I'm gonna judge by your guys' reactions.

1214
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:11,470
Hey, what's up?

1215
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:13,890
How's it going?

1216
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:15,050
Welcome back.

1217
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:18,590
We'll be in contact again, I guess.

1218
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:24,070
I missed my content wife, Yoshi.

1219
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,070
I'm so glad to be back with her.

1220
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:29,690
He got, like, separation anxiety after, like, two spaces away from me.

1221
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:30,350
That's so silly.

1222
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:33,010
I just miss my Felicias so much.

1223
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:34,930
Wait, where is your truck?

1224
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:35,570
You ever have that?

1225
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:37,970
When, like, you leave your house and then you come back and you're like, My cat!

1226
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:39,850
You go back to get something and you're like, My kitty!

1227
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,470
I just wanted to hug you again.

1228
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:42,110
I love you.

1229
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:47,070
Why did you put the half coin on the lucky thing?

1230
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:48,190
Why did you have to do that?

1231
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:50,530
Snick, remember you can blow the whistle.

1232
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:52,150
It would be so funny if you did that.

1233
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:55,130
You get a star for using a lot of items.

1234
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:57,150
What if you do?

1235
00:50:57,650 --> 00:50:59,130
Oh, and I have a creepy dice.

1236
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:00,670
Yeah, you do.

1237
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,530
I think I'll blow.

1238
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,770
I think it's time to blow the whistle.

1239
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:07,930
I just came from an unstable lobby.

1240
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:09,650
I'm so sorry for laughing.

1241
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,690
Where's it gonna go?

1242
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:15,850
Nobody knows.

1243
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:17,630
Oh my god, Chain Chomp is so cute.

1244
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:20,050
What?

1245
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:21,230
No way.

1246
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:22,590
Oh my god.

1247
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:23,730
No way.

1248
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:28,550
Are you serious?

1249
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:31,830
Wait, it's right next to her?

1250
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,350
This is so messed up.

1251
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,550
I can smell it from here.

1252
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:37,990
I hate this game.

1253
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:39,390
I hate this game.

1254
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:42,050
This game hates Toad.

1255
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:47,350
See, I was having an eternal crisis because I was gonna go north for the milk or south for the star.

1256
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,110
And I was like, I really don't want to pick between them.

1257
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,310
And now I can have both.

1258
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,630
God damn it, this is unfair.

1259
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,070
Oh my god.

1260
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:02,930
Welcome to the hop along Mario Party for dice rolls.

1261
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:05,830
This is what happens to me every time.

1262
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,150
Now I understand.

1263
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,430
I wonder where I'm gonna go.

1264
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:11,850
Now I understand why you don't organize Mario Party collabs.

1265
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:13,930
This is why nobody plays Mario Party.

1266
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:15,690
For me?

1267
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:18,310
Don't mind if I do.

1268
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,530
Alright guys, everybody get...

1269
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:20,870
Get...

1270
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:23,210
Get Giga.

1271
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,110
I can't stand up on Giga.

1272
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:30,330
Everybody get down.

1273
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:31,430
Everybody get down.

1274
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:33,270
So true.

1275
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:35,790
Alright everybody, we're bullying Giga.

1276
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:36,410
It's her turn.

1277
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:38,410
Hold on, I have to get my milk first.

1278
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,370
Did they put it right in front of fucking Giga again?

1279
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:41,910
Again?

1280
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:42,530
That's illegal.

1281
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:44,210
No way.

1282
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:44,890
No.

1283
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:48,250
She doesn't have the money.

1284
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:52,050
There's about to be a minigame.

1285
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:57,430
A shy guy raised his little arms.

1286
00:52:57,930 --> 00:52:59,470
Bonus minigame, get double the coins.

1287
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,710
Giga has to straight up come forth.

1288
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:03,090
Otherwise she gets another coin.

1289
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:04,670
I'm locking in.

1290
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,310
It's a quiz.

1291
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,210
Oh no, I'm so...

1292
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:13,010
I saw you on Jabroni Mike's quiz show.

1293
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:14,190
I saw you on Jabroni Mike's quiz show.

1294
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,390
Can I study these images of the balls and then answer the question?

1295
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:18,890
Wait, no, this is a visual memorization quiz.

1296
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:19,590
Oh no.

1297
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:20,470
Fuck you game.

1298
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:24,550
Doesn't Giga have good visual memory?

1299
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,270
Giga brain's good.

1300
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:29,090
Oh okay, actually this one isn't so bad.

1301
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:32,930
No, my brain...

1302
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:35,630
My brain do the no visual memory thing.

1303
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:36,210
Wait, what?

1304
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:36,210
Am I dumb?

1305
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,370
Surely the question won't be evil.

1306
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:43,810
Don't worry about it.

1307
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:47,830
If the questions are like that, it's not so bad.

1308
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:50,850
But if it's like how many pink stripes are on the front of each ball...

1309
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:51,350
I'm so fucked.

1310
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:53,930
I don't even know what they're gonna ask about.

1311
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,670
We should know what the question is first.

1312
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:56,410
Oh my gosh.

1313
00:53:58,150 --> 00:53:59,890
I'm looking at the stripes now.

1314
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:01,730
Look closely at fucking what?

1315
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:03,330
How many times did each toad rotate?

1316
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,230
Why do these guys look so similar?

1317
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:09,110
It's not fair.

1318
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:12,350
Oh my god.

1319
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:14,590
Which one is in the middle?

1320
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:18,610
Gee, I wonder.

1321
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:20,610
Oh, you had to press.

1322
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:22,090
I had to actually think about it.

1323
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:24,210
I didn't realize I had to confirm.

1324
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:25,070
Yeah, me neither.

1325
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,210
Oh, and it's by the time!

1326
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:33,250
Okay, okay.

1327
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:35,670
I did not know.

1328
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:36,470
We're so fucked.

1329
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:40,830
What the hell is that?

1330
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:42,590
What is that?

1331
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:43,050
I can't tell.

1332
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:43,710
Toad, please.

1333
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:45,670
Toad, I don't know what that is.

1334
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:46,710
Oh my god.

1335
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:49,670
Oh my god.

1336
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:50,370
Oh my god.

1337
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:50,850
What?

1338
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:53,950
Which one wasn't there?

1339
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:55,530
Oh, fuck.

1340
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:56,610
I think I picked the wrong one.

1341
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:00,670
Yeah!

1342
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,430
Please be that.

1343
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:05,910
That's it.

1344
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:07,950
So I can win.

1345
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:10,790
We have like one more and we must continue the Giga-cucking.

1346
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:11,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1347
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,310
Everybody picked the wrong answer.

1348
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:17,130
We have to pick the right answer.

1349
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:19,690
We gotta pick it quicker than Giga.

1350
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:20,430
Okay, okay.

1351
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:23,030
Oh my gosh.

1352
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:29,190
I don't like this.

1353
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,990
My game is like stuttering too.

1354
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:31,550
What?

1355
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:34,750
Oh, I don't know.

1356
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:36,550
Oh, I don't fucking know.

1357
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:44,890
Oh my gosh.

1358
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:45,870
I still got more points.

1359
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:49,610
Giga, you're the worst person I've ever met.

1360
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:51,190
But Giga had to straight up lose.

1361
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,510
Giga had to straight up lose.

1362
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,810
That's a random one and won.

1363
00:55:57,930 --> 00:55:59,210
You wanna know the secret?

1364
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:01,470
I actually knew the answer.

1365
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:03,690
I was just saying that so you wouldn't copy my answer.

1366
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:04,010
Oh.

1367
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:05,810
So you wouldn't get the points.

1368
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:09,550
I was just like, if Giga wins, then I get points too.

1369
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:10,710
And I'll move up.

1370
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:12,970
That was my thought process.

1371
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:15,490
New turn.

1372
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:18,410
Bye.

1373
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:22,590
A new turn in this jinx-fucking game.

1374
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:24,290
I'm so sorry.

1375
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:27,030
He didn't feel your love.

1376
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:29,110
You're very gorgeous to me.

1377
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:30,930
You're my erotic and chubby little man.

1378
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:34,170
It's very weird going first on a turn where you know the star is gonna move.

1379
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,190
Because it's like, what do I pick?

1380
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:38,650
Because the game could just decide to just screw me over again.

1381
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:38,910
Because the game could just decide to just screw me over again.

1382
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:41,110
You don't have a key, so you have to go on.

1383
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:41,870
I do have a key.

1384
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:44,190
That's the direction.

1385
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:45,950
I was going this direction specifically.

1386
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:47,770
Oh my god, no.

1387
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:51,650
But there's nothing I can do.

1388
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:54,250
I mean, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

1389
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:56,850
If I roll high enough...

1390
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:59,370
That's happening a lot.

1391
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:01,210
I'm rolling really high.

1392
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,970
I'm rolling so high this entire game.

1393
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:04,870
Motherfucker.

1394
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:12,090
I do not want to use the key.

1395
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:13,130
I hate keys.

1396
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:14,890
I'm so fucking sorry, dude.

1397
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:16,150
It's fine.

1398
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:17,650
This is just...

1399
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:21,030
I genuinely hop along the fucking board every time.

1400
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:21,910
Get another key.

1401
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:22,950
It's good.

1402
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:24,790
Oh yeah, another key, imagine.

1403
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:27,270
Two keys.

1404
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,190
One key that I'm not using.

1405
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,010
Two key.

1406
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:36,630
Alright, Matara.

1407
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:37,790
Alright, it's my turn.

1408
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:41,830
Just because I love you.

1409
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:43,310
Sometimes roll low.

1410
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:45,310
Are you...

1411
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:46,970
Oh, Mint, you know what would be so funny?

1412
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:47,550
What?

1413
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:50,370
Use your curse block on her.

1414
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:52,910
Come on.

1415
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:58,810
I should have saved my whistle.

1416
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:00,010
Wait.

1417
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:02,110
Use your curse block on her.

1418
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:06,130
Because then she's gonna have a chance to step on one.

1419
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,090
Wait, I'm live?

1420
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:09,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1421
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:11,270
Why are you so mean?

1422
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:12,990
I thought we were good.

1423
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:14,870
I thought we were going against Giga.

1424
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,050
Yeah, but sometimes...

1425
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:19,030
You gotta flip the script...

1426
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:19,710
Because it's funny.

1427
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,150
You know you wanna do it, it would be funny.

1428
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:28,270
Come on, Mint.

1429
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:31,190
Oh no.

1430
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:35,630
You know what might be funnier?

1431
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:39,610
It might be funnier to use it on Mata for suggesting something so fucking mean.

1432
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,710
What if I made it random and we let it up to chat?

1433
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:45,850
Here we go.

1434
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:47,230
What if it's you?

1435
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,490
Then that's my curse.

1436
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:54,450
Oh no.

1437
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:57,130
It's karma.

1438
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,290
I just lost guard train over Giga.

1439
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,750
It's karma for you.

1440
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:05,710
Oh my god, I'm never getting anywhere.

1441
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:08,530
Please let me through this fucking round.

1442
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:13,270
Have you actually left the first section of the board yet?

1443
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:14,670
No, I haven't seen anywhere.

1444
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:17,590
Giga, get a one.

1445
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:19,350
Giga, please get a one.

1446
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:25,130
So sad, Matara.

1447
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:27,670
This is so messed up.

1448
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:31,030
Yes!

1449
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:37,650
Ultimate power.

1450
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:41,370
Look at him, he's so happy.

1451
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:42,530
Look at his happy face.

1452
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:45,350
I think that's what he said.

1453
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:46,390
The rich get richer.

1454
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:49,690
I think I'm gonna become a landlord.

1455
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:51,990
Oh my god, it's right down the road from her!

1456
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:53,250
Are you kidding me?

1457
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,650
Wait, but you still have my room.

1458
00:59:55,810 --> 00:59:56,690
I'm paying you.

1459
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:58,630
I think it's 20 gift subs a day for my room.

1460
00:59:58,910 --> 00:59:59,670
Well, now it's 40.

1461
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:03,230
I can't afford that, that's a lot of subs a day.

1462
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:06,750
Oh wait, you're poor, yeah, you can't get it.

1463
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:10,130
Poor with three stars, sure.

1464
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:11,390
Poor warrior used to be.

1465
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:13,530
What is it called when you're asset rich?

1466
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:15,850
When you own houses but you don't have the cash to furnish it?

1467
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:17,830
Asset rich, I think?

1468
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:18,610
Oh yeah.

1469
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:21,050
I'll call you land rich, money poor.

1470
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:23,370
You have time to get enough.

1471
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:24,430
This is still messed up.

1472
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:26,190
I'm breast rich, mine poor.

1473
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:28,550
Do the...

1474
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:29,890
Thwomp.

1475
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:31,150
Thwomp the difference.

1476
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,410
You wanna thwomp, girl?

1477
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:35,750
Hey girl.

1478
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:37,230
I like the thwomp.

1479
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:39,710
Find the unique image behind the protective thwomp.

1480
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:44,130
Wait, sorry, I didn't know what I was pressing.

1481
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:45,830
Yeah, you actually have to like...

1482
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:47,810
Wait, what am I supposed to press?

1483
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:49,970
You actually got it right!

1484
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:51,190
Oh, I got it right!

1485
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:52,430
Oh my god.

1486
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:54,470
I can't believe it.

1487
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:57,290
Oh no, I have boomer reaction time.

1488
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:59,890
Wait, it says like...

1489
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:01,210
You have to pick the one that's unique.

1490
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:02,370
Oh, okay, I see, I see.

1491
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:05,950
Oh wait, no, the apples had different...

1492
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:07,950
The apples had the different leaves on them.

1493
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:09,870
Oh my gosh, so it's not just easy.

1494
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:12,930
Why can't it be... And you can't change your answer once you pick.

1495
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:13,650
This is messed up.

1496
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:16,610
Oh, they're different directions!

1497
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:17,170
Okay.

1498
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:20,810
Yeah, so we made a Mistake.

1499
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:22,150
I followed you.

1500
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:23,190
You made the Mistake.

1501
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,570
Wait, it says to use the face button.

1502
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,050
Oh, I was gonna say to select the picture.

1503
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,030
I was like, there's only three.

1504
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:30,810
No, there's four!

1505
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:31,930
Now there's four.

1506
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:39,350
I'm scared, I'm scared.

1507
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:41,490
Me too, but I think I'm good.

1508
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:42,930
After this I gotta pee though.

1509
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:46,810
Thank you girls, for permission.

1510
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:53,410
Ah, this is messed up.

1511
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:54,290
Wait, I'm scared.

1512
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:57,030
Wait...

1513
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:58,190
Which one was it?

1514
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:03,490
Which one was it, Giga?

1515
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:05,210
Oh, by a millisecond.

1516
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:07,270
Oh my gosh.

1517
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:09,910
Oh, I'm sweaty.

1518
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:10,790
I'm sweaty spaghetti.

1519
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:12,970
Grape!

1520
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:16,650
Banana!

1521
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:22,790
What?!

1522
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:24,230
How are you guys so fast?

1523
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:27,110
Mint, you were so cute and you gave me energy.

1524
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:29,610
Mint, you being cute actually gave me energy.

1525
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:31,390
I love cute girls, you know this.

1526
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,980
I call lag.

1527
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,020
Wait, what was that one, the first one?

1528
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:43,740
Oh, are you sure?

1529
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:44,320
Yeah.

1530
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,720
I'm so fuckin' sure.

1531
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,640
Because we knew it was like an apple.

1532
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,860
I didn't realize it was an apple.

1533
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,460
Giga, no!

1534
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,860
I'm losing.

1535
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:00,860
I need two more rounds.

1536
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:02,040
Wait, what?

1537
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,180
Okay, they're all bananas.

1538
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:05,940
Bananas.

1539
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,800
Stop it.

1540
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,740
Eat, eat, eat apples and bananas.

1541
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:14,960
Oh, and then a fourth one.

1542
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,640
Oh my god.

1543
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,160
Why is there more?

1544
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,520
I'm so tired.

1545
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,960
I'm so fuckin' tired of this.

1546
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,080
What?

1547
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:32,680
I hope I'm right.

1548
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,420
What's wrong with you?

1549
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:38,680
Actually, I think you're right.

1550
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,240
What?

1551
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:42,740
You were right.

1552
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:44,580
Yay.

1553
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:48,900
Oh my gosh, Lions, we tied.

1554
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:50,240
Hooray.

1555
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:56,040
If we could not have any more visual memorization games, that would be great.

1556
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:56,660
Right?

1557
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:01,560
There's a worst game where you have to put keys in a gate.

1558
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,180
It's probably the worst game, I think.

1559
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:05,320
Oh my gosh.

1560
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,780
Maybe I'm kinda smart.

1561
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,340
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

1562
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,360
Let's give it time.

1563
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:15,460
Stretch.

1564
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:17,380
What?

1565
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,640
What do you mean final five turns?

1566
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,080
I haven't even moved it yet.

1567
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:22,420
Five turns.

1568
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:28,200
I promise, every time I've said the games take a long time, they haven't taken a long time.

1569
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:28,960
I'm sorry.

1570
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,420
It's okay, then we get to do two maps.

1571
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:31,940
Yeah.

1572
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:35,780
I hope they tell that I'm gonna be the one who they think will win.

1573
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:38,200
You actually, no, you get to decide for a reward.

1574
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:41,180
You know what you should do?

1575
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:41,840
What?

1576
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:42,340
Bowser's face.

1577
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,580
You already know.

1578
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,340
Wait, what was that?

1579
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:47,880
Star Steal.

1580
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:50,780
Giga.

1581
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:50,880
Giga.

1582
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:54,760
I have some Korean fried chicken.

1583
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,260
You're making it go so fast, I can't read.

1584
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,080
Oh my god, wait.

1585
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:00,800
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to.

1586
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,120
Wait, what did they say?

1587
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,020
We've never played this.

1588
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:07,460
Yoshi, roll a one.

1589
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:08,480
Come on.

1590
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:10,180
Well, that's what I've been doing all game.

1591
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,060
Another one.

1592
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,520
Come on, who's my good girl?

1593
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:15,220
Give me a one.

1594
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,020
Go pee.

1595
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:16,800
Go pee.

1596
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:19,820
I'm gonna have my turn after, so I'm gonna pee after.

1597
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:22,740
And then we'll start the...

1598
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:25,680
Maybe the one wasn't such a bad idea.

1599
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:27,700
This could be good.

1600
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,480
This could be great.

1601
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:31,020
Steal everything.

1602
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:32,520
He's so big.

1603
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,220
Don't ask me why I'm the small cousin.

1604
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,320
Lose one star.

1605
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:39,580
What?

1606
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:41,240
What?

1607
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,040
Oh my god.

1608
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,720
He scammed you!

1609
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,420
He scammed you for real!

1610
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,080
At least I didn't get robbed, I guess.

1611
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,160
I'm gonna be right back, hold on.

1612
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,280
Imposter Bowser?

1613
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:55,380
I've never even seen that before.

1614
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:57,580
You're welcome.

1615
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:59,460
I really appreciate that.

1616
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,800
Yeah, put that down, like, right in front of...

1617
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,920
Giga, you know?

1618
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,100
Actually, we should all put ours right in front of Giga.

1619
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,860
I'm not close enough to Giga.

1620
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,280
Oh, it has to be close?

1621
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:11,940
Oh, nevermind.

1622
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:14,980
Oh, is it, like, two spaces out from you?

1623
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:16,860
That's what it looks like.

1624
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,540
Then save it, save it.

1625
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,200
So sad.

1626
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,540
Give me one second, hold on.

1627
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:24,640
She's hacking.

1628
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,280
She's gonna change the game rules.

1629
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,220
She's gonna hit the lag switch and we're all gonna lose.

1630
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:30,140
She's gonna unplug her internet.

1631
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:35,080
Wait, what?

1632
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:36,520
Alright, I'm here.

1633
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:37,440
What's up?

1634
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,360
Where'd you go?

1635
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:41,140
Heavenly raided me.

1636
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:43,100
I'm gonna be playing with them afterwards as well.

1637
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,040
Oh my god, you have the whole day.

1638
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,720
I have the whole day, baby.

1639
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:52,640
My last collab cancelled, so it's just gonna be Mel and I either doing webfishing or powerwashing.

1640
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,120
I love webfishing.

1641
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,080
Hey, you wanna help her?

1642
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,720
We're not getting a spy on the air.

1643
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,020
We can't do it early enough.

1644
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,320
And I think I'm gonna max on my...

1645
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:03,520
Anyway.

1646
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,020
Sorry, girls.

1647
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:06,180
We showed you only things.

1648
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:08,720
Alright.

1649
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,320
Can I kill Giga?

1650
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,300
I think I could try.

1651
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,920
Do they sell a gun in the shop?

1652
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:20,040
I have six coins, two train stops and a dream.

1653
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:21,340
Go, go, go.

1654
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,460
Giga stole my quote, by the way.

1655
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:29,160
Giga came to Vishojo before me and her quote was, it is not enough that I win, others must lose.

1656
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:32,540
You can't choose which way you go, Madara.

1657
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:34,060
Giga, Giga, Giga, come on, come on.

1658
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:34,780
Ah!

1659
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:38,500
Am I two stations back, though?

1660
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:39,400
Where's the second station?

1661
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,440
No, you're not.

1662
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:42,700
Oh, I'm behind it?

1663
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:45,740
Who's that?

1664
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,100
Wait, yeah.

1665
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:48,980
Wait, what?

1666
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,520
Two for one!

1667
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,060
Two for one!

1668
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:56,660
I'm such a gamer girl.

1669
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:01,080
I can't get anywhere on this fucking place.

1670
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,260
I gotta pee.

1671
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,580
I'm gonna piss myself.

1672
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:05,840
No!

1673
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,240
I'm gonna piss myself.

1674
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,680
Oh my gosh!

1675
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:17,180
I got a two for one.

1676
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,100
Five collateral damage at this!

1677
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,360
Call imposter Bowser on an opponent?

1678
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,000
Oh my god.

1679
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,080
Imposter among us.

1680
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,100
Do it for Giga, do it for Giga.

1681
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:30,760
Yeah, I have to.

1682
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,300
Oh my gosh, you got so much stuff.

1683
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:33,780
What happened?

1684
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:36,380
But the thing is, I don't wanna duel Giga.

1685
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,420
I can't wait.

1686
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,920
Okay, it's my turn.

1687
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:49,800
Alright.

1688
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,600
You're doing amazing, Mint.

1689
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,300
Just keep going forward.

1690
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:58,180
This is just my afterlife, man.

1691
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:01,340
Two steps forward, fifty steps back.

1692
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:02,980
All the damn time.

1693
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,540
Which way should I...

1694
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,400
Okay, I'm gonna do it here.

1695
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:10,600
Because if I do it here, you could always just go that way.

1696
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:14,920
There's only one choice.

1697
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,500
Okay, here I go.

1698
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:18,580
I hope I don't get two.

1699
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:21,420
Three!

1700
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:26,760
Oh wait, you have to get one.

1701
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:27,020
Okay.

1702
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:31,160
Alright, get one!

1703
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:31,820
One!

1704
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:32,120
One!

1705
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,300
What if I just did this?

1706
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:38,440
Giga, no.

1707
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:39,680
Giga, no!

1708
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:43,160
Let's just say I could use an item...

1709
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:44,900
and be safe.

1710
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,040
Is it Matara?

1711
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,740
Why was Giga back at the start?

1712
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:50,980
Why is Matara now back at the start?

1713
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:51,900
What the fuck did I miss?

1714
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:52,400
No!

1715
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:58,800
Why is Mint crying hysterically?

1716
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:00,300
What the fuck did I miss?

1717
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:02,260
No!

1718
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:04,180
Wait, what did I miss?

1719
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,140
Hey, Matara, you...

1720
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:10,800
Hi, Matara, it's fine, don't worry about it.

1721
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:12,080
How?

1722
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,420
I just went for a walk, you know?

1723
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,340
How did she do this?

1724
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:18,700
Giga, you used the mirror, you little shit!

1725
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:21,340
Lime, I squished both of them.

1726
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,440
I squished both of them.

1727
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,320
I've been hit by a train two times.

1728
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,540
She's been hit by the train again!

1729
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:29,200
No, please, no, please!

1730
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:29,700
Stop it!

1731
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:32,700
Oh my god!

1732
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,180
Just barely, just barely!

1733
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,620
You have another mirror, I guess.

1734
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:40,960
I do.

1735
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:42,800
Everyone's gonna be down here with me.

1736
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:45,380
Okay, Matara, don't get a one, okay?

1737
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,540
That's awful.

1738
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:48,500
Why?

1739
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:49,440
I want a one.

1740
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:50,400
1v3!

1741
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,760
I see.

1742
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,120
Squeaky shakedown!

1743
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:56,500
What does this mean?

1744
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:02,620
Wait, what is this?

1745
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,320
It's the team side with the squeaky.

1746
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,160
Oh god, the lag is so bad.

1747
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,960
The lag is so bad!

1748
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:13,340
Oh my god, it's really bad.

1749
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:15,060
Like, it's stuttering.

1750
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,000
Why me, why me?

1751
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:22,300
Because I'm lagging so much I don't know if I can actually get to the others.

1752
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:25,040
Stop!

1753
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,460
Just go for Giga!

1754
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:28,760
So Giga has not enough coins.

1755
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:30,840
Giga's not winning on coins.

1756
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,380
Giga's winning on the 18th coins.

1757
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:37,300
But Giga needs less coins to get enough so she doesn't get the next one, too.

1758
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:41,040
I don't think I'm gonna be able to get enough stars away from anyone to prevent them from dying.

1759
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,560
It's okay, you can have mine.

1760
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:45,860
Oh, that's so kind of you.

1761
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:46,760
I love your kitty.

1762
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:53,100
It's so bad, the whole thing is like stuttering.

1763
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,460
Can you guys hear that my voice is like a little bit out of it?

1764
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:00,960
Is it?

1765
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,120
Girl, stop!

1766
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:04,480
She sounds similar to me.

1767
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,160
I definitely feel like I'm still Raspi, but...

1768
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:11,140
It always sounds worse in your head.

1769
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,680
Like, from your ears than it actually sounds.

1770
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:14,980
You don't sound so bad.

1771
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:15,400
Oh my God.

1772
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:17,120
I sound great, Minze.

1773
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:17,540
Say that.

1774
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:21,060
Say I sound great.

1775
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,780
You're making me distracted.

1776
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:24,100
You're ruining my luck.

1777
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,080
You're ruining my day.

1778
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,080
You're ruining my time.

1779
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:27,400
You're ruining the game.

1780
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:32,640
Yay,

1781
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:36,780
we're all winners.

1782
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,220
Yoshi presents at the end of every minigame.

1783
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:40,840
You haven't noticed?

1784
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,040
I have so many coins and nothing to do with them.

1785
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:54,040
You might get a star at the end.

1786
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:56,920
Where it's like, oh my God, coin lady, here you go.

1787
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:00,560
If we were playing with 15 turns, once you get a friend...

1788
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,860
you can actually buy 2 stars at a time with them.

1789
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:08,580
So you can pay 40 gold to buy 2 stars if you have the little buddy, like Wario was.

1790
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,060
And you can get a ghost that you steal a star from somebody.

1791
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,960
Matara, don't forget your Bowser thing.

1792
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,100
You should do 2 spaces, Limes.

1793
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:21,240
What?

1794
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:22,700
2 spaces?

1795
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,380
Oh, shut up.

1796
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,060
She doesn't have a star.

1797
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:26,560
I mean, it doesn't matter because I don't have a star.

1798
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,620
Don't go 2 spaces, Limes.

1799
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,860
Put it on top of Bowser, it's just the whammy.

1800
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,400
You can't, unfortunately.

1801
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:39,780
I guess we'll just trap this entire hallway.

1802
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,440
We're all at the beginning though.

1803
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:46,980
Yeah, well, I don't have time to get all the way back to you guys.

1804
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,560
Wait, where am I even going?

1805
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:49,000
Hold on.

1806
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,780
You can take the train, you can crush another soul.

1807
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:52,760
You could.

1808
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:54,580
Where the heck is the star?

1809
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:55,740
Oh, it's all the way back there.

1810
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,160
Giga sounded so smug.

1811
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,320
I mean, it's not really near anybody, right?

1812
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,380
Because you guys have to go around to get to it.

1813
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:17,380
I don't think that's how you say that.

1814
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,480
You can get milked!

1815
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:21,580
I can get milked?

1816
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:22,160
Get milked!

1817
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:22,560
Get milked!

1818
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:23,160
Milk!

1819
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:24,400
Milk!

1820
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:24,800
Milk!

1821
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:27,160
I'm gonna get that Wiggler milk.

1822
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:27,780
Look at him.

1823
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:28,580
Hey buddy.

1824
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:30,380
Howdy.

1825
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,800
You can invite opponents over for a fun time.

1826
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,860
Would you like to invite someone to share?

1827
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:36,400
Come on, Limes.

1828
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,720
I'm not winning, so I'm gonna invite everyone for some milk.

1829
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:44,400
You can all come back up here and we'll make a race for the star.

1830
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,860
Hoot nanny star!

1831
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,280
Alright, we're coming.

1832
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:48,840
Hi!

1833
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:51,300
I guess we're gonna have a hoot nanny.

1834
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:54,360
What's going on here?

1835
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,860
Why does the milk look all weird?

1836
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,380
It looks like specks in the glass.

1837
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,760
Yeah, I don't know if I like milk.

1838
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:01,320
Are you all ready?

1839
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,480
I don't think I'm ready.

1840
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:04,480
Oh, I see.

1841
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,520
The glasses are spotted and then they filled them with milk after.

1842
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:12,900
Oh, so the whole purpose of this, apart from the fact that it's milk related...

1843
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:14,200
is you get to drag people around the board.

1844
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:14,580
I see.

1845
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:15,480
Don't forget your item.

1846
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:16,860
Don't forget the Bowser.

1847
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,060
Okay, everybody do a race to the star.

1848
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,140
Yeah, race to the star.

1849
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:22,620
Here we go.

1850
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:22,620
How many am I awake?

1851
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:25,740
I can do three, but I don't know if I can do nineteen in three.

1852
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,240
It's kinda crazy.

1853
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:31,070
You would have to get... No, no, cause...

1854
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,120
Yeah, you couldn't.

1855
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:36,560
Do it.

1856
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,360
Ring ring, Moshi Moshi.

1857
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:39,920
What's that?

1858
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:41,820
You know someone who wants to meet me?

1859
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,000
Yeah, I do.

1860
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,420
Well, I'm not loyal to my fans.

1861
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,200
I'll give them a call myself.

1862
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,900
Giga's a loyal fan.

1863
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:50,620
Giga's a loyal fan.

1864
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,140
It's imposter Bowser.

1865
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,200
He's totally a different Bowser, guys.

1866
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:58,600
Wait, who is it?

1867
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:02,860
Wait, how did you know that I wanted to pick Giga?

1868
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:03,780
It was random.

1869
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:06,020
Oh my god, that's so scary about this game.

1870
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,160
Hey Giga, you must lose a star.

1871
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:14,120
Giga's gonna get the thousand coins thing and it's actually gonna give it to Giga.

1872
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:14,720
Right?

1873
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:18,940
Come on, Giga.

1874
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,100
Lose a star.

1875
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,500
Lose a star.

1876
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:22,760
Bowser, what is this?

1877
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,220
Wait, what is this?

1878
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,240
Everyone gets the same number of coins.

1879
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,060
This is the worst.

1880
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,380
This is the worst.

1881
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,800
This is the worst.

1882
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,220
This is bobbinism.

1883
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:45,440
I like how we're all at like second now because nobody has any stars.

1884
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:46,880
I know, we're all winners.

1885
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:48,960
No way.

1886
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:52,500
All of us are equal, but some are more equal than others.

1887
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:59,260
Adam and Barb, why?

1888
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:02,880
Four legs good, two legs bad, am I right?

1889
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:05,760
Giga, you're the champagne socialist.

1890
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,520
What's going on?

1891
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:09,500
Yeah, I'm the most equal out of all of us equal people here.

1892
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,800
She got her three stars and then she's like, we should all have two coins as well.

1893
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,360
The rich gets richer.

1894
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,060
We have the same money, so we're the same, guys.

1895
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,220
I have the least coins, so I'm not really gonna complain.

1896
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:25,420
I just spent 20 coins getting milk for everybody, so you know, I consider it death root.

1897
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,900
She spent our coins.

1898
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:33,380
This is the furthest I've been on the board.

1899
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:36,240
How does it feel?

1900
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:37,840
Feels good.

1901
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:39,660
Oh no.

1902
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:40,940
Wait, why?

1903
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:42,300
Oh my God.

1904
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:44,180
Oh, a duel.

1905
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:46,200
How many coins?

1906
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:47,680
OK, all in.

1907
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:48,380
Bet all 53.

1908
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:49,220
Yeah, all in.

1909
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,880
I am.

1910
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:51,980
Are you betting all 59?

1911
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,980
No, you choose to bet.

1912
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:55,880
Oh, I see, I see.

1913
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:56,360
I can go high.

1914
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:57,780
Oh, I can only go up to 53.

1915
01:17:58,020 --> 01:17:58,200
OK.

1916
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:58,900
Let's go.

1917
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:00,920
Let's go, Mick.

1918
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:02,260
You come up behind me.

1919
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:05,520
I always go all in.

1920
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:06,920
I'm gonna lose.

1921
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:07,400
Let's go, Mick.

1922
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:08,500
I'm gonna lose.

1923
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:10,480
Mick, I'm seeing you for Thanksgiving.

1924
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:11,180
I know.

1925
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:12,540
I will remember this.

1926
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,240
I'm gonna lose.

1927
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,760
I mean, you might be giving thanks for the coins you're about to get, potentially.

1928
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:19,040
Do a ground pound.

1929
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,300
Do a ground pound to spin the hat and hit your opponent, and then dodge it with a jump.

1930
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,640
The opponent dodging, the hat gets...

1931
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,180
Like those slap competitions.

1932
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:29,860
Why did it hit you first?

1933
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:31,540
Oh.

1934
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:33,820
Ground pounding slightly earlier.

1935
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,300
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

1936
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:40,140
I'm smaller.

1937
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:46,180
OK, OK, I see.

1938
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:47,940
I know your game, I know your game.

1939
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,540
I like this, I like this.

1940
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,360
Oh gosh, I don't like this.

1941
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,060
I don't like this at all.

1942
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:58,820
Slap him.

1943
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:03,420
I like how it's literally like a butt spanking animation.

1944
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:06,400
Please.

1945
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:07,860
I want to live.

1946
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:10,680
I like it so.

1947
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:11,820
What?

1948
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:12,320
What?

1949
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:18,060
Yeah.

1950
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:21,520
I'm still surprised you didn't just jump ever.

1951
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,660
Yeah, I was just ground pounding the whole way.

1952
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:27,660
I thought you could just ground pound.

1953
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:31,220
I'll take your 106 coins, baby.

1954
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,940
Guys, do you remember when I had... I used to rule the world.

1955
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:37,500
I had 83 coins.

1956
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,600
I used to rule the world.

1957
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:43,080
I used to rule the world with no stars.

1958
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:43,760
That's impressive.

1959
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:45,160
This is before socialism came.

1960
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,320
OK, I live in the here and now, you know what I mean?

1961
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:49,080
You gotta let go.

1962
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,520
Why would you do this?

1963
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:59,800
I dare you to put it two ahead of you and then roll two.

1964
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:00,540
I dare you.

1965
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:01,500
Imagine.

1966
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:04,720
What if I didn't?

1967
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,060
I don't think it's gonna work because she's just gonna give the star to herself, right?

1968
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:08,640
Yeah.

1969
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,080
Wait.

1970
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:12,760
No.

1971
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:13,420
Please, no.

1972
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:13,760
God.

1973
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:14,720
No, no, no.

1974
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:15,680
No!

1975
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:17,860
No!

1976
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:23,040
Please, God.

1977
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:23,880
I just...

1978
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:25,120
Pikmitara, please.

1979
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,060
Please, Pikmitara.

1980
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,340
Please, don't do this to me.

1981
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:31,480
She can't Pikmitara because Pikmitara has no coins.

1982
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,180
No, please, God.

1983
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:33,880
Please, God.

1984
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:35,920
You should have done random.

1985
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:37,960
You should have done random.

1986
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,080
I earned my coins.

1987
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:43,980
I earned my coins.

1988
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:47,500
Look at this mercy being displayed right now.

1989
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:50,060
Why are you being nice to her, huh?

1990
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:56,080
Gigi isn't about kicking people when they're down, unlike some people, apparently.

1991
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,480
I would never kick you girls when you're down.

1992
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,860
You're just always short, so I'm always kinda kicking you.

1993
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:02,920
You have 10 seconds to decide where to roll a ball.

1994
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,300
Take out as many stones.

1995
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:04,940
What's a stone?

1996
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:05,800
Oh, I see.

1997
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,240
It's a bowling ball thing.

1998
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:11,120
Yeah, it's like bowling and you gotta try and figure out...

1999
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,600
by visually planning it, which I'm really good at.

2000
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:18,300
You have the eyepatch.

2001
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:19,480
You have like...

2002
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,360
Oh my gosh, wait.

2003
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:20,600
No.

2004
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:22,100
How are you doing this?

2005
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:22,960
What?

2006
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:26,440
Okay.

2007
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:29,060
Alright.

2008
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,440
One more practice round.

2009
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:32,580
No, I'm good.

2010
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:35,140
I'm just ready to... I'm ready for...

2011
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:35,980
Look at the Moai.

2012
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:36,740
They're so funny.

2013
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:39,000
Wait, why are their faces like that?

2014
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:41,700
Oh my god.

2015
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,600
Is it at least a different spread each time?

2016
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,700
Yeah, it looks like it.

2017
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:46,700
Right, okay.

2018
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,900
Okay, I'm gonna get as close as yours is.

2019
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:53,900
I believe in you.

2020
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:55,440
I'm gonna switch at the last minute, you know?

2021
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:57,060
I did, I did.

2022
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:57,340
No.

2023
01:21:58,140 --> 01:21:59,800
I believe in you both.

2024
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:00,600
No, please.

2025
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,320
We're gonna do great.

2026
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:02,360
No, no, no.

2027
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:04,260
Bounce, bounce, bounce.

2028
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,820
Oh my gosh.

2029
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,560
Mint collected.

2030
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:10,500
I can't believe it.

2031
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:11,860
Oh my god.

2032
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,860
Mint is making bank right at the end.

2033
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:17,300
Please only be one round.

2034
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:17,960
Yeah!

2035
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:22,940
It's my coin.

2036
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:25,620
Stop challenging me!

2037
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,400
Stop!

2038
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:32,020
Stop challenging me!

2039
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:35,940
No, I'm gonna roll one.

2040
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:36,820
That's what I've been doing.

2041
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:39,740
I actually don't think I've hit one the entire time.

2042
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:40,420
It's mostly been two.

2043
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:42,140
Wait, what's going on?

2044
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:42,720
Two to four.

2045
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,040
I'm gonna get the award for most coins collected, I think.

2046
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,500
I'm gonna get the award for most times crashed by train.

2047
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:56,300
Least spaces walked, moved.

2048
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,500
Is there a star award for literally nothing fucking happened to you this game?

2049
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:04,300
I got an award for least spaces moved.

2050
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:04,900
Oh, that's me.

2051
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,100
Jump to dodge light waves.

2052
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:09,540
Attack your opponents by doing a ground pound.

2053
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:13,880
Oh, it's literally just the same game except it's light waves instead of a slappy hand, which is less fun.

2054
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:14,600
Oh, yeah.

2055
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:17,320
And it's like a lot of things you have to...

2056
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:18,920
Do you have iframes while you're ground pounding?

2057
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:19,260
No.

2058
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:20,200
No, you don't.

2059
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:20,800
You do not.

2060
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,400
You do not.

2061
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:23,060
Okay, I'm ready to die here.

2062
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,520
Are you ready to die?

2063
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:27,020
I'm ready to die.

2064
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:28,160
You wanna play a game?

2065
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,060
Trying to distract me.

2066
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,500
I think lag... Oh my god.

2067
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:40,860
I knew it.

2068
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:42,840
I think it's the latency.

2069
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:43,880
Oh, what?

2070
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:44,540
Oh my god.

2071
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:46,560
I died too fast.

2072
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:47,620
Nice.

2073
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:51,360
I present in celebration.

2074
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:57,840
I do have EU latency on every fucking game.

2075
01:23:58,700 --> 01:23:59,600
It's true.

2076
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:04,540
Didn't you guys... When you played Deadlock, what did you guys play it on?

2077
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:16,440
I made Bricky play on Europe when it was for us, and then when... After that Steam went down, so they switched it up and we were on EU... I'm sorry, East US.

2078
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,660
Yeah, because I'm East Coast, so I was able to...

2079
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:19,020
That's a good US.

2080
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,200
Yeah, so Giga was like...

2081
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:20,840
The West is a good US.

2082
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:21,820
Good US.

2083
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:25,440
Yeah, if it had been West Coast, I might have just been like, you know what?

2084
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,140
You guys have fun.

2085
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:28,420
Like 300 of us.

2086
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:32,920
But Bricky can deal with that, that's fine.

2087
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,240
I don't care if Bricky has to deal with it.

2088
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,160
He can suffer.

2089
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,240
He's suffering.

2090
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:39,920
He's actually in the mines right now.

2091
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:42,260
He's packaging my merch as we speak.

2092
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44,160
In the mines.

2093
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,320
Can I look at the board?

2094
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:49,540
Wait, if I take a ticket, where will I go?

2095
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:50,460
Find out.

2096
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:50,880
Wait, please.

2097
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:53,680
No, I think I go past the star, right?

2098
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,300
Yeah, I think so.

2099
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:57,020
Which...

2100
01:24:57,940 --> 01:24:59,820
This is a perfect hashtag ad.

2101
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:04,800
When y'all filled out your form, what did you guys get for merch from me?

2102
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:09,400
I sent out a little form to some friends, so they can have some merch.

2103
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,600
Giga, did you even fill in your form?

2104
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:12,240
Be honest with me.

2105
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,000
I think I did.

2106
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:14,440
Can you please fill it out?

2107
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:15,640
Because stuff is about to sell out, Giga.

2108
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:16,020
Please.

2109
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:16,520
Okay.

2110
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:17,440
Please.

2111
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,160
So, question.

2112
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:24,080
With the train, I assume if I ride it, I will go past the star.

2113
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,460
You cannot, like, get off halfway.

2114
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:26,780
No, yeah, you go past it.

2115
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:27,720
Try it.

2116
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:32,180
Mataracon.shop No, but if she goes the other way, then...

2117
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:33,280
Look, I'm standing right there.

2118
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:33,600
Please.

2119
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:35,220
Look how cute I am.

2120
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:35,720
Kill her.

2121
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:36,440
Please, stop.

2122
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,540
Please, I'm just a little guy.

2123
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:40,060
Please.

2124
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:42,720
How many turns do we have?

2125
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:43,580
We have two turns.

2126
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:44,700
We have three turns, right?

2127
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:46,860
I'm not getting this fucking star, am I?

2128
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:47,340
Oh, no.

2129
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:48,060
Wait, Lime.

2130
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:50,960
I'm just a little guy.

2131
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:51,800
Ew, what's up?

2132
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,680
Lime, you brought us all here.

2133
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,380
Why would you send me back?

2134
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:56,800
Lime, kill her.

2135
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,700
I brought you to the top of the board.

2136
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:00,620
I can send you back to the bottom of the board.

2137
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:05,180
Look how happy he looks just standing on the railroad tracks.

2138
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:07,580
He shouldn't be there, but he doesn't know any better.

2139
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,740
I'm not winning, so maybe I just opt for chaos, I guess.

2140
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:11,040
No, please.

2141
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:13,740
I am curious.

2142
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:15,180
Did any of you get the daki?

2143
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,140
Because you want to hug me in the night.

2144
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:18,520
I did not get the daki.

2145
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,300
I did not get a daki.

2146
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:20,640
Oh, wait.

2147
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,780
All of us got it in the beginning.

2148
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:24,180
You guys.

2149
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:25,840
You could be hugging me.

2150
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:27,120
They all hate me.

2151
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,520
All these small women hate me.

2152
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:29,300
Kill me!

2153
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:30,600
Kill me!

2154
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:31,860
You're gonna die too!

2155
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:32,560
Bitch!

2156
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:36,140
That was worth it.

2157
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,840
That was absolutely worth it.

2158
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:42,340
It was not really a strategic decision as much as a funny decision.

2159
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:42,800
Yeah.

2160
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:45,460
Hey, sometimes funny is the best strategy.

2161
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:49,460
You have to pay for the ticket and then you have to pay for the ride?

2162
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,080
That's crazy.

2163
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:50,660
Yeah.

2164
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:53,540
Wait, where does one stop take me?

2165
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:54,200
Oh, OK.

2166
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:56,660
So it takes me all the way to the bottom, which I don't want, so...

2167
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,740
He's like, you called me all the way up here and then you don't want to stop?

2168
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:01,440
What the fuck?

2169
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:02,920
Well, just try for the star.

2170
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:03,780
You can get it.

2171
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:05,400
Sure.

2172
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:06,320
Oh!

2173
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:07,240
What's happening?

2174
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,460
What is this, too?

2175
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:09,600
Oh, he's driving.

2176
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:10,420
He's going again.

2177
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:11,160
He's going again.

2178
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:12,080
Oh my god.

2179
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:13,560
Oh my god.

2180
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:14,340
No, you don't get hit.

2181
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,680
You're in the green zone.

2182
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:18,920
I'm back where I belong.

2183
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:20,580
Wait!

2184
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:21,580
Oh my gosh, wait!

2185
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:25,120
Wait, if Giga gets one, then I get her star.

2186
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:29,800
Alright, how far is the star?

2187
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:30,460
Are you guys kidding me?

2188
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:33,820
Giga has the mirror though, so Giga's just going straight back up here.

2189
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:34,380
You know that.

2190
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:35,380
Oh, true.

2191
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:40,360
What's the fist?

2192
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:41,080
What is that?

2193
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,840
I think it's a dueling glove.

2194
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,060
Oh, I can't?

2195
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:46,760
Oh, because I don't have a star.

2196
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:48,860
Dammit.

2197
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:49,520
You can't win.

2198
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:52,360
You could only duel for coins.

2199
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,960
No, it wasn't even letting me pick the item, unfortunately.

2200
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:56,300
Oh, what the heck?

2201
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:57,300
Oh, okay.

2202
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:00,700
La la la la la la, watashi wa star.

2203
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:03,100
Watashi wa star, watashi wa star.

2204
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:04,400
Oh, wow, that was so fast.

2205
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:05,160
I did that by accident.

2206
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:06,740
Oops, you should cover that song, guys.

2207
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:07,740
You're just...

2208
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:11,600
But yeah, Gigi, get your stuff now before it sells out, please.

2209
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,460
I did, I already did it.

2210
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,240
Did you get a doki so you can hug me?

2211
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:15,060
No.

2212
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:16,980
Okay, let me see what Gigi got.

2213
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:17,320
I don't have a pillow.

2214
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:18,560
You suck.

2215
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,300
Why does nobody want to hug me?

2216
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:24,200
I have a doki and it is 3 inches.

2217
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,720
It is a mini keychain doki.

2218
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:26,460
That's all I have.

2219
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:27,560
Oh, I have one of those too.

2220
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:29,540
Yeah, I got one of Mint Nuke.

2221
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:33,540
Okay, you got the standee, the keychain, the raid poster and the sticker sheet.

2222
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:33,840
Nice.

2223
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:36,920
What did Mint get?

2224
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:40,360
I got the acrylic stand and the poster.

2225
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:42,460
Wow, I thought you liked me.

2226
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:43,480
Why didn't you get more stuff?

2227
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:46,160
Well, I left stuff for people to buy.

2228
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:49,060
No, they have stuff to buy.

2229
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:50,320
Get the most stuff.

2230
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,680
Get free stuff from me.

2231
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:58,680
Okay, Lime got standee, cozy keychain, other keychain, raid poster and the other poster and the sticker sheet.

2232
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:01,960
See, at least Lime gets more stuff.

2233
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:02,400
One.

2234
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:03,300
Get a one.

2235
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:03,940
Now.

2236
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:05,140
Get a one.

2237
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:05,740
Now.

2238
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:07,200
Get a one.

2239
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:08,080
Now.

2240
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:09,540
But like...

2241
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:10,140
Now.

2242
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:11,780
But like...

2243
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:12,080
Now.

2244
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:15,520
Like, it would be such a shame to not use this item.

2245
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:16,860
Like, I don't wanna be wasteful.

2246
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:17,800
No, no, no.

2247
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:18,360
You know what I mean?

2248
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,840
But also, my game has been so fucking miserable.

2249
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:27,180
Come on, you should just roll for your luck, you know?

2250
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:29,660
It would be more fun to see what you roll.

2251
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:33,520
I think I just gotta, you know, what if I left it all alone in my pocket?

2252
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:34,060
I hope it's me.

2253
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:36,520
Goddammit.

2254
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:38,880
Oh my goodness!

2255
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:40,640
Oh no!

2256
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,980
I'll never leave the beach!

2257
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:47,940
I'll never leave the beach!

2258
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:50,940
Oh my...

2259
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:52,460
Vika, that was masterful.

2260
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:53,280
I love you.

2261
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:55,660
I'm fucking outta here.

2262
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:57,680
And you can actually just use the thing?

2263
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:58,480
Very good.

2264
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:00,280
I'm going.

2265
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:03,460
Oh dear.

2266
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:07,080
I like how the train looks a little bit more like Santa's sleigh or something.

2267
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:08,520
Sleigh!

2268
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,780
Also, somebody's asking if it's possible for us to run out of stock.

2269
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:17,020
So, the thing is, we pre-ordered a few stuff.

2270
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:17,980
A lot of stuff.

2271
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:21,620
And most of it is already half gone, but there's a lot of stuff that is done in-house.

2272
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:25,960
Like the posters, the sticker sheet, the shirt, and what was the other thing?

2273
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:29,080
Don't worry guys, I'll cut out stickers.

2274
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:31,920
But don't worry, we're getting more stuff.

2275
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:33,180
Very, very soon.

2276
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:36,100
Because I think it's until January 15th.

2277
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,600
I'm gonna sit there and cut them by hand.

2278
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:39,580
Do it.

2279
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:42,680
Oh no, this picture is the stuff that's actually done in-house, so it's fine.

2280
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:44,740
How many shirts?

2281
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:47,040
Last we heard, 1,500 shirts.

2282
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:53,780
That's one thing that you girls didn't get on your thing, but when people get a shirt, they get a number.

2283
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:58,500
So if somebody orders a shirt, on the side it's gonna be number 1501.

2284
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,120
Unique, right?

2285
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:00,340
Yeah, it's gonna be unique.

2286
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:10,440
I can hear somebody mashing.

2287
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:14,000
It's gonna be fun.

2288
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:15,520
Okay, mash A.

2289
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:18,040
I see.

2290
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:19,260
Alright, let's go.

2291
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,140
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

2292
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:27,900
Tranquilize the forest.

2293
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:30,160
Oh my God, I started late.

2294
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:35,060
It hurts!

2295
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:36,860
It hurts!

2296
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:38,760
It hurts!

2297
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:39,920
Oh my God.

2298
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:43,060
It hurts so bad.

2299
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:44,060
Oh God.

2300
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:45,060
That was not great.

2301
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:46,920
I don't think mine was good either.

2302
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,740
We all did decently.

2303
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:55,740
Oh my God!

2304
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,560
Just by one!

2305
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:01,220
By one mint!

2306
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:03,100
That's my baby girl, that's my mint.

2307
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:08,180
The clutch, for real.

2308
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:09,980
I'm gonna pay for that tomorrow, holy shit.

2309
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:11,700
I know, my finger.

2310
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:16,780
My carpal tunnel is like...

2311
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:19,020
I have wrist issues.

2312
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:22,160
I had a spot where I stopped for a full second.

2313
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:25,820
You guys should have played Metal Gear Solid, I'm just saying.

2314
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,420
Thank you, Kang!

2315
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,260
Buddy, look at his little teeth!

2316
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:33,420
Why did he come at the final two turns?

2317
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:34,460
Yeah, it's like Joe Biden.

2318
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:36,160
Buddy is here for a single turn.

2319
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:39,280
Look, his teeth retracted.

2320
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,640
I know, he's so huge.

2321
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:46,320
I do wonder what kind of things...

2322
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:49,600
Before hitting the dice move to a random space, that's not...

2323
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:49,780
What?

2324
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:51,000
Great, is it?

2325
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
That sounds awful.

2326
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:56,580
He's all the way over there, and we're all the way on the opposite side, so...

2327
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:59,800
I mean, it might be good for you guys, yeah, because it could teleport you back up here a little bit.

2328
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:00,260
That's true.

2329
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:03,480
But there's no way we're getting to him in two turns.

2330
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:04,200
Are we?

2331
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,260
Get to him, run to him.

2332
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:07,800
Oh my gosh, you're so close.

2333
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:09,060
Eleven to the star.

2334
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,480
I'd love to buy something, what do you got?

2335
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:15,140
Can you make up for the fact that my dice rolls suck?

2336
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:16,180
You can.

2337
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,260
Imagine if they had a golden pipe.

2338
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:18,380
I know, right?

2339
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,580
Should I just get a triple dice?

2340
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:21,980
Or...

2341
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:23,760
I think you could get a double dice.

2342
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:24,480
Might as well.

2343
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:25,560
Yeah.

2344
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:26,460
Yeah?

2345
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,860
Let's see if I can't use it until next turn.

2346
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:37,060
There's no way that Giga is gonna swipe the star, even though she could roll high and actually swipe the star, so it's gonna be fine.

2347
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:38,420
I would never.

2348
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:42,180
It was eleven from where you were.

2349
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:47,940
Four to the star.

2350
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:51,080
Four to the star.

2351
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:55,060
I wonder how far I am visualizing the star.

2352
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:56,720
I am manifesting it right now.

2353
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,480
Okay, okay, close your eyes.

2354
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:01,880
Now imagine holding the star.

2355
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:03,260
Imagine touching it.

2356
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:05,340
I'm firmly grasping it right now.

2357
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:06,800
It's stabbing my neck.

2358
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:10,040
I'm dying, I'm dying.

2359
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:11,100
I'm bleeding out.

2360
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:12,160
I'm bleeding out of the hole.

2361
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:12,780
I'm bleeding out.

2362
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:13,300
It's so hot.

2363
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:17,920
Despite all my rage, I am still just a ghost in a cage.

2364
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:21,440
Go.

2365
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:22,700
You're gonna go somewhere?

2366
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:23,120
Now.

2367
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:24,940
Oh, it was my turn.

2368
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:25,380
Yes.

2369
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:27,180
That's you on the left.

2370
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:28,640
You chose Bowser.

2371
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:30,040
I did, I did.

2372
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:30,480
I'm sorry.

2373
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:32,700
Why are you viewing the board like you're gonna get anything?

2374
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:33,380
Come on.

2375
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,580
Why are you mean to me?

2376
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,380
Why are you mean to me?

2377
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:38,940
Do the triple.

2378
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:40,060
I wish I could duel you.

2379
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:41,040
I'm gonna do the triple.

2380
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,840
You already dueled me and you lost.

2381
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:43,600
Get over it.

2382
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,540
You know what's gonna happen?

2383
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:49,620
I'm gonna get that star next turn with my triple dice.

2384
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:54,480
And then the star is going to spawn in right ahead of me and I'm gonna run straight to the next star.

2385
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:55,380
And it's gonna be great.

2386
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:55,700
It's true.

2387
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:56,080
Just you wait.

2388
01:34:56,180 --> 01:35:00,840
I hope it's gonna be the biggest comeback that has ever been envisioned.

2389
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:01,840
The biggest rebound.

2390
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:04,580
And then the game's gonna give me like three pity stars at the end.

2391
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:05,200
It's gonna be good.

2392
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:08,920
I hope the star comes to the beginning of the board.

2393
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:11,760
It probably will.

2394
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,600
What if it manifests right behind you?

2395
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,020
That would be really sad.

2396
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:18,800
So sad.

2397
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:21,240
Yep, I've gifted subs for Mint.

2398
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:21,880
So sad.

2399
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:24,480
The only thing that will make her happy.

2400
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:27,580
The only thing that will make her happy is if you gift her subs.

2401
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:31,740
God, so sad.

2402
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:32,620
I need more people.

2403
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,080
She needs more subs, you heard that?

2404
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:35,900
Oh my god.

2405
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:37,580
She's just never satisfied.

2406
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:38,680
I'm never satisfied.

2407
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,400
She loves Batara.

2408
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:47,600
Thanks for the gifted memberships.

2409
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:55,840
Oh my gosh, thank you!

2410
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,320
Thank you for the 50!

2411
01:35:58,840 --> 01:35:59,880
Thank you so much!

2412
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:02,380
Thank you guys for the gifted.

2413
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:03,380
Gifted, thank you.

2414
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:04,560
You guys don't actually have to.

2415
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:05,180
Thank you so much.

2416
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:06,320
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

2417
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:11,460
All in, baby, all in, baby, all in, baby, all in, baby, all in, baby.

2418
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:13,020
All in, baby, all in, baby.

2419
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:18,280
Because I'm about to get 6 coins from this space.

2420
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:19,280
Thank you guys so much!

2421
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:19,980
Thank you!

2422
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:22,040
Thank you!

2423
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:23,160
Thank you guys, thank you!

2424
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:24,400
Oh my gosh, thank you guys.

2425
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:25,480
Thank you for the gifted.

2426
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:26,220
Thank you!

2427
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:28,360
Please, I'm satisfied.

2428
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:30,540
I'm full, I'm full, I'm full, I'm full.

2429
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:32,040
Thank you.

2430
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:35,400
Fuzzy's so cute.

2431
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:36,300
Wait, what is this?

2432
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:38,180
Super Mario.

2433
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:45,620
Nice, nice, nice.

2434
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:49,020
I don't like the sheer amount of drift on this, holy shit.

2435
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,480
Oh my God.

2436
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:51,680
Oh, nice, nice.

2437
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:52,720
Oh my God.

2438
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:56,180
Oh, that was so close.

2439
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,360
Oh my God, that was so close.

2440
01:36:58,920 --> 01:36:59,560
I love how...

2441
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,100
Thank you for the commentary!

2442
01:37:02,540 --> 01:37:05,040
Sorry, I'm like, watching e-sports.

2443
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,480
Oh my God, you almost got fucking destroyed there.

2444
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:11,840
This one's fun to watch.

2445
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,380
I wouldn't want to participate though.

2446
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:18,300
A hit, a hit for Giga, a hit for Lime.

2447
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:19,180
Oh my God.

2448
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:20,780
Boom, Tetris for Giga.

2449
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:21,840
Boom, Tetris for Lime.

2450
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:22,880
Boom, Tetris for Lime.

2451
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:24,680
Boom, Tetris for Lime.

2452
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:25,320
Boom, Tetris for Lime.

2453
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:26,640
Oh my God, Lime is killing it.

2454
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:28,240
Giga is losing.

2455
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:31,120
Oh my God, go, go!

2456
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:32,300
Who are we cheering for, chat?

2457
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:33,140
Who are we cheering for?

2458
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:35,080
We're cheering for anybody, actually.

2459
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:36,260
Lime, let's go Lime!

2460
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:37,120
Come on, Lime!

2461
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:38,000
Go Lime!

2462
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:40,480
Lime is killing it right now.

2463
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:40,800
Oh my God, go!

2464
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:41,900
The only one who can beat Giga.

2465
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:44,280
Nice.

2466
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:47,060
Nice.

2467
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:48,900
Nice.

2468
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:54,440
113.

2469
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:58,960
Nice throw in the butt.

2470
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:01,420
I told you, I present in victory.

2471
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:02,500
Thank you.

2472
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:06,940
She won the battle, but Giga won the war.

2473
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,500
Wait, it ain't over yet.

2474
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:11,620
It ain't over yet.

2475
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:13,120
Look at this.

2476
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:13,840
Pretty!

2477
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:15,020
Thank you!

2478
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:16,260
Thank you for the birthday gift!

2479
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:16,940
Thank you!

2480
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:19,060
Oh my gosh, thank you so much!

2481
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:21,760
Thank you so much.

2482
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:22,400
Thank you.

2483
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:25,860
I'm ready.

2484
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,920
Oh gosh, I'm not ready.

2485
01:38:26,980 --> 01:38:28,140
Oh, this one is just coins though.

2486
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:30,500
This one is not too bad.

2487
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:31,660
What is this?

2488
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:32,540
I don't think I've seen this one.

2489
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:35,520
I say it in the sense that like...

2490
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:38,500
Oh, I see.

2491
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:38,740
I see.

2492
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:41,940
Not coin.

2493
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:42,860
Get out of the way!

2494
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:44,380
Wait, I'm last.

2495
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:45,680
Can I have a single coin?

2496
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:46,140
Nope.

2497
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:46,540
Nope.

2498
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,420
This is also practice, so don't worry about it.

2499
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:51,940
Hey guys, you're supposed to be...

2500
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:54,460
Please, a single coin.

2501
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:56,180
Have one coin, please.

2502
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:57,180
You're supposed to be gifting to Mint.

2503
01:38:58,340 --> 01:38:58,880
They are.

2504
01:38:59,020 --> 01:38:59,240
They are.

2505
01:38:59,380 --> 01:38:59,780
They have.

2506
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:00,180
They have.

2507
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:00,560
Don't worry.

2508
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:02,260
I worry.

2509
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:04,360
Stop, please!

2510
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:07,640
Good!

2511
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:10,360
Good!

2512
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:13,320
I got punished for my hubris!

2513
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:15,960
Go Mint!

2514
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:16,320
Go!

2515
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:17,220
Get all of them!

2516
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:23,700
Oh my god.

2517
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:27,760
I got punished for my hubris.

2518
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:30,120
Yippee!

2519
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:34,170
It is very scary on an auto-scroller like that when the game starts lagging.

2520
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:41,000
Hey Pookie, how are you feeling?

2521
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:42,540
Very good job, everybody.

2522
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:44,040
We got big money there.

2523
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:46,240
The entire game, it said no change.

2524
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:50,940
The entire game.

2525
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:54,660
What if I use my triple block and get free ones?

2526
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,460
That would just kind of caps them off the screen.

2527
01:39:58,380 --> 01:39:58,880
Cinema.

2528
01:39:59,380 --> 01:39:59,860
Oh my god.

2529
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:00,140
Cinema.

2530
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:00,600
Cinema.

2531
01:40:00,940 --> 01:40:00,980
Cinema.

2532
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:01,560
Cinema.

2533
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:02,100
Cinema.

2534
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:04,500
You are cinema.

2535
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:06,580
Oh, never mind.

2536
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:10,780
It'll do.

2537
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:11,980
It'll do.

2538
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:13,520
That'll do, Donkey.

2539
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:14,640
That'll do.

2540
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:15,640
Me!

2541
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:18,760
Wait.

2542
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:20,880
You know what to do.

2543
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:21,720
You have the coins.

2544
01:40:21,820 --> 01:40:22,640
You have the coins.

2545
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:25,060
I have the coins.

2546
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:27,120
And you'll have enough coins for the next star.

2547
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:27,700
No!

2548
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:29,080
I have the coins.

2549
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:30,460
You have the coins.

2550
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:31,780
I have the coins.

2551
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:32,680
Do it.

2552
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:33,960
The comeback!

2553
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:35,560
The comeback is real!

2554
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:36,500
The comeback is real!

2555
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:39,920
I repay Giga's kindness by stealing her coins.

2556
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:41,180
The comeback is real!

2557
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:42,180
First, don't leave it.

2558
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:42,820
I'm sorry.

2559
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:50,200
So cute.

2560
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:53,200
I'm sorry, Giga.

2561
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:55,600
Why are you apologizing?

2562
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,740
Giga's been first the entire game.

2563
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:01,260
But she hasn't personally wronged me.

2564
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,000
Well, she has personally wronged me.

2565
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:05,960
Yeah, and me.

2566
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:07,060
That is true.

2567
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:10,200
Thank you!

2568
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,180
I really appreciate it.

2569
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:14,940
Thank you!

2570
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:16,720
Thank you so much!

2571
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,500
Where the hell is that?

2572
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:21,540
It's over.

2573
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:22,780
It's so over.

2574
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:26,280
14 left.

2575
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:28,840
You... 14 what left?

2576
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,240
That her, she has movement left.

2577
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:32,400
Oh, wow.

2578
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:33,000
Oh my goodness.

2579
01:41:33,740 --> 01:41:37,280
Maybe I just wander around in circles here so I don't step on any of those fucking traps.

2580
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:38,700
But as you know, it should be fine because I can count it.

2581
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:40,720
How many did I say I have?

2582
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:41,820
12.

2583
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:42,360
1.

2584
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:43,020
11.

2585
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:43,460
6.

2586
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:45,160
14.

2587
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:45,740
13.

2588
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:46,080
17.

2589
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:47,240
20.

2590
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:48,300
14.

2591
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:48,960
13.

2592
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,060
19,972.

2593
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:52,200
I think that was it.

2594
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:52,600
5.

2595
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:53,620
5.

2596
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:54,120
5.

2597
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:56,120
3.

2598
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:56,520
2.

2599
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:56,740
1.

2600
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:57,240
25.

2601
01:41:57,260 --> 01:41:57,920
I have 13.

2602
01:41:58,040 --> 01:41:58,160
OK.

2603
01:41:58,280 --> 01:41:58,420
1.

2604
01:41:58,520 --> 01:41:58,780
2.

2605
01:41:58,780 --> 01:41:58,980
3.

2606
01:41:59,100 --> 01:41:59,300
4.

2607
01:41:59,340 --> 01:41:59,660
5.

2608
01:41:59,740 --> 01:41:59,880
6.

2609
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:00,200
No, no.

2610
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:01,800
Add 2 to that.

2611
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:04,180
OK.

2612
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:05,320
And then subtract 3.

2613
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:07,240
And then divide by...

2614
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:07,460
Uh-huh.

2615
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:07,780
Uh-huh.

2616
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:08,580
I'm with you so far.

2617
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:10,120
Where are we carrying the 1?

2618
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:12,160
44.

2619
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:13,800
Yeah.

2620
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:14,340
It's 44.

2621
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:16,820
44.

2622
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:20,080
Alright, Giga.

2623
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:21,180
I mean, not Giga.

2624
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:21,520
Shit.

2625
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:21,920
I'm sorry.

2626
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:22,820
You're all so small.

2627
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:23,560
It's just...

2628
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:24,380
Oh my god.

2629
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:25,620
Just come on!

2630
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,080
She always does this.

2631
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:29,220
Limes is thinking.

2632
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:30,300
Let her think.

2633
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:31,680
Don't pass me.

2634
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,460
Don't hurt yourself.

2635
01:42:33,020 --> 01:42:33,740
Don't pass me.

2636
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:35,600
You'll regret it.

2637
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:40,840
Wait, you might actually be able to get to the star.

2638
01:42:40,940 --> 01:42:41,860
It's a little horsey.

2639
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:42,660
No, this is the last turn.

2640
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:43,860
Oh, it is?

2641
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:44,180
OK.

2642
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:45,520
Yeah, it's the last turn.

2643
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:47,500
Betrayal.

2644
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:47,640
Oh.

2645
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:55,000
I'm never... I haven't even... I haven't been past the Trade Station.

2646
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,100
Wait, actually.

2647
01:42:58,460 --> 01:42:58,820
Hold on.

2648
01:42:58,820 --> 01:42:59,240
Editor.

2649
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:00,500
Did you enjoy the bottom of the map, Mintz?

2650
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:01,360
Did I what?

2651
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:03,760
Did you enjoy the bottom of the map?

2652
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:06,600
Yeah, I really liked seeing this part.

2653
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:08,860
Real, real, real, real.

2654
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:13,060
Can somebody add... My editor, can you double check if this is true when you added this?

2655
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:14,420
What?

2656
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,780
Make a little fact check in the notes of the... We have people clipping in the Discord and stuff.

2657
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,360
Oh, how far I've been?

2658
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,520
If you've actually never passed.

2659
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:26,400
No, because I got run over.

2660
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:30,080
The furthest I've gotten was because Lime called me for milk.

2661
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,520
I got summoned for milk and stuff.

2662
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:36,880
OK, you still don't have enough for the stupid star.

2663
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:41,000
I put a three dice that I still don't have enough to either buy it or even afford it.

2664
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:41,120
No way.

2665
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:41,880
Oh, you're so close.

2666
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:43,280
And I don't have the money.

2667
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:44,800
Just open up and see what happens.

2668
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:46,900
I did.

2669
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:48,180
I did and then I got hurt.

2670
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:49,940
And then I got hurt and it sucked.

2671
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:51,040
I don't like opening up.

2672
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:51,900
Wait, what does this do?

2673
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:52,520
What does this do?

2674
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:53,040
I'm scared.

2675
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:54,300
No, no.

2676
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:58,280
Oh, what's happening?

2677
01:43:58,820 --> 01:44:00,400
I'm in heaven, finally.

2678
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:05,200
Chance time.

2679
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:07,940
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2680
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:08,720
I'm gonna lose another star.

2681
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,140
Oh wait, I missed Donkey.

2682
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:11,420
I'm so sad.

2683
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:11,860
Donkey?

2684
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:13,220
Donkey?

2685
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:14,680
Sorry, I meant DJ.

2686
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:17,840
To me!

2687
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:22,960
It's better than nothing.

2688
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:23,540
Alright.

2689
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:30,920
Sorry, I don't think she was...

2690
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:32,900
Wait, did I actually sabotage Lime?

2691
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:34,860
Lime is in second!

2692
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:36,640
Lime has two stars!

2693
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,340
There's no sabotaging!

2694
01:44:39,580 --> 01:44:43,100
No, she could've been first, because you got all of the coins.

2695
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,900
There's still bonus stars, potentially, though.

2696
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:46,900
That's fine.

2697
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:47,720
It's fine.

2698
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:49,840
Yeah, no, we might have bonus stars.

2699
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:55,020
She still is not off the train platform.

2700
01:44:58,680 --> 01:44:59,720
Oh my god.

2701
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:00,340
Yippee!

2702
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:00,820
20!

2703
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:02,800
I have so many coins.

2704
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:04,500
287.

2705
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:09,020
Oh my god.

2706
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,320
You're gonna get a star from those coins, probably, Mint.

2707
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:11,780
Ghost chicken!

2708
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:12,480
Thank you for the message!

2709
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:13,620
Thank you!

2710
01:45:14,020 --> 01:45:15,100
Thank you so much!

2711
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:18,140
Yeah, I'll get that.

2712
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:19,140
Maybe.

2713
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:21,740
Maybe.

2714
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:27,660
Yes, zero.

2715
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:33,260
Tell Rubby to check in the game with the girls if Mint really truly never made it past the bottom.

2716
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:33,960
It's true!

2717
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:42,420
I have the most coins because I don't do anything.

2718
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:43,360
I don't go anywhere.

2719
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:48,040
Give me them coins.

2720
01:45:48,580 --> 01:45:49,740
Wait, not for me, please.

2721
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:50,560
That's all I have.

2722
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:52,320
That's all I have.

2723
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:53,140
Please.

2724
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:55,320
But you wanna look so juicy.

2725
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:56,180
No, please.

2726
01:45:56,260 --> 01:45:57,840
It's literally all I have.

2727
01:45:58,360 --> 01:45:59,340
Just take it from Tara.

2728
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:00,960
She's the one doing the sub-a-thon.

2729
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:02,000
Let's all bully the...

2730
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:02,340
It's true.

2731
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:04,120
You have been given enough.

2732
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:04,700
Why are you bullying me?

2733
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:06,960
I've given you free sub-ups.

2734
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:09,040
What are you doing?

2735
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:12,040
I invited you guys to the club.

2736
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:13,460
Thank you.

2737
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:16,100
You girls haven't even talked about my amazing merchandise.

2738
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:16,900
Thank you so much.

2739
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:17,580
You have!

2740
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:18,880
Oh, wait.

2741
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:19,200
Hold on.

2742
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:20,560
You just ignored me.

2743
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:22,020
MataraCon.shop.

2744
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:23,100
Get your t-shirts.

2745
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,000
Get your stickers.

2746
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:25,380
Get your t-shirts.

2747
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:26,160
Get your stickers.

2748
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:28,340
You're reusing your voice from last year.

2749
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:29,520
MataraCon.shop.

2750
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:37,240
I had Yiga record a commercial for me last year.

2751
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:40,820
Thank you for not having the train send me back to the beginning again.

2752
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:44,440
Oh, you missed out.

2753
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:45,300
You should've.

2754
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:47,400
I would've gotten hit.

2755
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:51,520
Do you think there is a got hit by this fucking train the most times, Stars?

2756
01:46:51,620 --> 01:46:53,360
Guys, knock me out when I'm down.

2757
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:54,180
Cookie Cutter.

2758
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:55,200
I'm already down.

2759
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,980
Oh no, this is so much easier for you guys.

2760
01:46:58,620 --> 01:47:00,140
This game is so easy for you.

2761
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:02,600
I have to remember three shapes.

2762
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:09,340
Basically, I have to remember three shapes.

2763
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:11,840
And you guys just have to call out one shape and you're good.

2764
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:13,460
Wait, what do you mean by that?

2765
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:17,500
We each own a cookie cutter and the right person has to cut one of their shapes.

2766
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:18,640
Just look at your shape and...

2767
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:19,100
Oh, I see.

2768
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:20,180
OK, OK, OK.

2769
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:20,860
I see.

2770
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:21,400
OK.

2771
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:23,760
Oh, OK, OK, OK.

2772
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:24,220
That's not bad.

2773
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:25,200
I get you.

2774
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:25,540
OK.

2775
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:27,400
It's so much easier for you guys.

2776
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:29,220
Just wait for yours.

2777
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:31,900
This is unfair for you, Ashley.

2778
01:47:32,620 --> 01:47:34,720
Some of the team games are such bullshit.

2779
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:35,600
I know.

2780
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:39,920
Alright, here we go.

2781
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:43,460
Look at which one you are and remember it.

2782
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:44,400
I am...

2783
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:47,280
I am Mushroom.

2784
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:47,820
Go!

2785
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:53,000
Go?

2786
01:47:53,780 --> 01:47:54,060
Go?

2787
01:47:54,460 --> 01:47:54,820
OK.

2788
01:47:55,420 --> 01:47:56,580
Maybe we should go?

2789
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,360
Please don't distract me, guys.

2790
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:01,140
Please, please, please.

2791
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:02,560
Matara, talk about your merch.

2792
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:03,360
Talk about your merch.

2793
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:04,700
Matara, Matara, Matara.

2794
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:06,760
Matara, Matara, Matara.

2795
01:48:06,940 --> 01:48:07,620
Look, look, look, look.

2796
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:07,960
Oh my God.

2797
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:08,580
Matara, look.

2798
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:09,140
Matara, look.

2799
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:09,820
Matara.

2800
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:10,380
Oh my God.

2801
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:11,380
Wait, someone's raiding you.

2802
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:12,580
Matara, someone's raiding you.

2803
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:13,660
You have to say thank you.

2804
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:14,980
You have to say thank you, Matara.

2805
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:16,740
Matara, Matara, Matara, Matara.

2806
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:20,040
Matara, star, star, star, star.

2807
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:29,100
I actually clocked in.

2808
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:30,360
You did.

2809
01:48:30,460 --> 01:48:31,220
Wait, it's lagging.

2810
01:48:35,660 --> 01:48:36,940
Very good.

2811
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:38,980
Uninstalled this game in every game ever.

2812
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:40,740
This was rigged in your favor.

2813
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:43,660
This is because you played two games before this.

2814
01:48:43,660 --> 01:48:45,300
Yeah, yeah.

2815
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:46,820
I was on the three.

2816
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:48,960
I was on the three team.

2817
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:51,680
Now it's time for the results.

2818
01:48:52,700 --> 01:48:53,140
Hooray!

2819
01:48:53,740 --> 01:48:54,680
I wonder who won.

2820
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:56,560
Actually, genuinely, it could be Limes or Higa.

2821
01:48:56,920 --> 01:49:02,460
I mean, depending on the bonus stars, it could also decide to give, like, two pity stars to someone or something like that.

2822
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:02,900
That's true.

2823
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:04,640
To Mint and she wins.

2824
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:06,680
It's possible.

2825
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:08,820
I kind of want Mint to win.

2826
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:09,960
I think it would be really funny.

2827
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:13,380
Star distribution.

2828
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:17,660
This is messed up.

2829
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:20,300
This is so messed up.

2830
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:25,760
Messed up, dude.

2831
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:26,320
Look at that.

2832
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,280
Present the bonus stars.

2833
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:31,040
Rich bo... It's Mint!

2834
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:32,020
Please me.

2835
01:49:32,620 --> 01:49:33,380
Please me.

2836
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:36,060
I wonder who's it gonna be.

2837
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:36,620
Hooray!

2838
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:40,320
Oh my god, I'd like to thank my mom.

2839
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:44,340
I'm gonna thank your mom at Thanksgiving.

2840
01:49:45,780 --> 01:49:47,800
That's what I'm gonna be thankful for at Thanksgiving.

2841
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:51,600
Yoshi!

2842
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:55,680
Could it be?

2843
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:56,580
Could it be?

2844
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:57,460
The comeback?

2845
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:57,980
The comeback?

2846
01:49:58,840 --> 01:49:59,760
I've never won.

2847
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:00,620
That's bullshit.

2848
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:00,980
Wait.

2849
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:01,800
Wait.

2850
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:03,920
There's only two bonus!

2851
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:06,120
There's only two bonus!

2852
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:09,340
I earned mine and you paid for yours at the end.

2853
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:12,960
I hate these rich people, man.

2854
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,780
Oh my god.

2855
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:16,220
Mine's malicious.

2856
01:50:16,220 --> 01:50:18,780
I have to say it's all fucking skill.

2857
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:21,120
It's such random bullshit.

2858
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:22,060
Oh my god.

2859
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:24,360
The finer details.

2860
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:26,160
Okay.

2861
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,280
I hate Mario Party.

2862
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:32,760
Get a lot of coins.

2863
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:36,020
Wait, most shopping?

2864
01:50:36,120 --> 01:50:37,380
I think I shopped like once.

2865
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:38,800
Oh no, I didn't.

2866
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:41,340
I got zero stars, so I didn't actually win the most minigames.

2867
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:44,200
I mean, you did, it's just not a bonus star.

2868
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:46,180
So congratulations on winning the minigames.

2869
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:50,980
I got 351 coins?

2870
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:52,120
What the hell?

2871
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:54,060
Oh my god.

2872
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:56,760
I got the star and whatever the heck that was.

2873
01:50:58,100 --> 01:50:58,540
Nice.

2874
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:00,180
I don't understand.

2875
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:01,500
Wait, is this the minigame?

2876
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:02,700
Mario Party is so dumb, dude.

2877
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:06,640
It's like someone will be like absolutely cruising and then just...

2878
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:07,360
It was like, nah.

2879
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:08,260
Nah.

2880
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:12,200
Oh my god.

2881
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:13,840
Oh, number... Okay, number of minigames won.

2882
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:15,540
Oh yeah, you got the most.

2883
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:16,960
Yeah.

2884
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:18,440
Yeah.

2885
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:18,920
Really?

2886
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:19,440
Yeah.

2887
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:19,620
Yeah.

2888
01:51:19,620 --> 01:51:20,900
Number of items won.

2889
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:22,980
But number of items used?

2890
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:24,040
You used a lot too.

2891
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:24,960
What's this one?

2892
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:26,280
Number of reactions used?

2893
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:28,060
I used 67 reactions.

2894
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:32,140
Wait, did I win number of reactions?

2895
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:33,540
No, I did.

2896
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:34,840
You did?

2897
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:37,540
Oh man, I need to Yoshi what more.

2898
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:39,760
Oh my god, I actually won the minigames.

2899
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:40,020
What?

2900
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:41,000
That's so unlike me.

2901
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:41,240
Yeah.

2902
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:43,260
That never happens.

2903
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:48,580
Got fourth pla... Wait, I got fourth place?

2904
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:49,460
What happened?

2905
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:50,400
Cause you're dumb.

2906
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:53,960
No, I think it was because that was the one for the host.

2907
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:55,520
Oh, okay.

2908
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:56,360
Yeah, that was the host.

2909
01:51:56,360 --> 01:51:59,300
Wait, let's go to the party plaza so we can get more reactions.

2910
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:02,720
Yeah, let's buy some and spam them.

2911
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:03,860
I'm gonna buy some, yeah.

2912
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:05,280
Also, she's not dumb.

2913
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:05,740
I love you.

2914
01:52:06,100 --> 01:52:06,400
Who's dumb?

2915
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,740
My voice is like really starting to give out and we're on day two.

2916
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:09,620
I know, are you okay?

2917
01:52:10,700 --> 01:52:11,260
Yeah, I'm fine.

2918
01:52:11,420 --> 01:52:15,720
I think it's because I... Since I'm in the basement, I put heating in my room when I went to bed.

2919
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:18,660
So I think I'm also just, you know, all old and dried up.

2920
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:19,560
It won't let me buy.

2921
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:22,960
Oh, I don't think we can... Yeah, we have to be in our own plazas because Nintendo.

2922
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:24,580
No!

2923
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:26,900
Alright, what are we buying?

2924
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:27,720
How do I buy stuff?

2925
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:28,160
You can't.

2926
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:29,600
You cannot in this room.

2927
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:30,000
Yeah.

2928
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:32,080
You would have to leave.

2929
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:34,240
Okay, I'm outta here.

2930
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:36,120
I wanna spend my coins.

2931
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:37,820
Yeah, let me spend my coins.

2932
01:52:37,820 --> 01:52:40,800
If you wanna leave and just buy stuff in Discord and talk about it...

2933
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:46,620
Because I don't think... If it's okay, usually I play another game, but I haven't had time to do...

2934
01:52:46,620 --> 01:52:51,500
The problem with streaming all the time is that I'm also like answering my managers, planning collabs.

2935
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:53,300
So I have a lot of admin stuff I have to do.

2936
01:52:53,940 --> 01:52:54,840
That's why you wanna end it here?

2937
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:55,600
Lunch break.

2938
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:57,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2939
01:52:57,720 --> 01:52:58,360
If that's okay.

2940
01:52:58,780 --> 01:53:00,140
But we can still yap a little bit.

2941
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:01,240
I just...

2942
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:04,700
I just definitely need to like, you know, answer.

2943
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:08,760
I have so many people messaging me about stuff, but I need to send out an app for everybody.

2944
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:09,140
Okay.

2945
01:53:09,660 --> 01:53:13,320
I didn't realize it's actually like, you know, I'm here all day.

2946
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:15,480
What did you think?

2947
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:17,840
A 24-hour sub-a-thon?

2948
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:24,420
I can't believe that a 24-hour sub-a-thon is for 24 hours a day.

2949
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:24,740
24 hours?

2950
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:25,060
Shit!

2951
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:28,440
No, actually, it's little stuff, right?

2952
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:29,140
Like my manager...

2953
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:33,800
My manager asking me about stuff and things like that.

2954
01:53:33,940 --> 01:53:34,340
Yeah, yeah.

2955
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:36,540
I'm a professional button masher.

2956
01:53:36,540 --> 01:53:39,520
Party points to go shopping at the Party Plaza shops.

2957
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:41,580
Keep playing to collect more points.

2958
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:44,500
I'm trying to do like the Nintendo voice, but I ruined it at the end.

2959
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:45,560
I'm getting achievements.

2960
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:46,600
Here, I'll do it too.

2961
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:50,480
Earning achievements grants you rewards for raising your player rank.

2962
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:52,640
That was perfect.

2963
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:53,540
Thanks.

2964
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:55,540
Can you imagine if Toad did all of the announcements?

2965
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:59,260
Like just fucking incomprehensible Nintendo announcements the entire time.

2966
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:01,640
It's like when Donald Duck speaks anytime.

2967
01:54:02,860 --> 01:54:04,400
Dude, they made a battle pass.

2968
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:05,880
Yeah, they did.

2969
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:07,940
Oh shit, the Nintendo battle pass.

2970
01:54:08,020 --> 01:54:08,440
Hell yeah.

2971
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:09,880
Hit!

2972
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:10,960
There's a hit.

2973
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:11,840
Is there a miss?

2974
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:13,360
I like how there's a reaction shop.

2975
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:14,360
There's no miss!

2976
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:15,960
Where do I buy the stickers, by the way?

2977
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:17,560
No, there's no miss!

2978
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:19,300
Presumably the reaction shop.

2979
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:21,240
Yeah, it's the reaction shop.

2980
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:22,960
Where's the reaction shop?

2981
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:27,500
I don't know which one it is, and if you press the wrong one, it's probably gonna give you like a 5 minute tutorial, so good luck.

2982
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:28,240
These are fun.

2983
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:29,560
I'm going to another island.

2984
01:54:30,980 --> 01:54:32,200
There's a good game.

2985
01:54:32,940 --> 01:54:35,940
I know which one the reaction shop is, I'm not telling you.

2986
01:54:36,260 --> 01:54:37,860
It actually says on the top left.

2987
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:40,560
You have to be like, I love you, and then that's it.

2988
01:54:40,620 --> 01:54:41,260
That's what I get.

2989
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:41,860
You jerk.

2990
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:44,760
Which one, guys?

2991
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:46,120
I have enough for one more.

2992
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:48,760
They only have like one page of stickers.

2993
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:49,360
I know!

2994
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:50,920
They don't have the good ones.

2995
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,340
Wait, you only have enough for one more?

2996
01:54:52,380 --> 01:54:53,480
How many did you buy?

2997
01:54:54,380 --> 01:54:54,780
Two.

2998
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:56,500
Okay.

2999
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:58,460
Is this stickers?

3000
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:01,780
I like the lucky you one because it feels kind of sarcastic.

3001
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:02,880
Like, lucky you!

3002
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:04,300
It does feel kind of...

3003
01:55:04,300 --> 01:55:05,800
I'm gonna be so sarcastic with it.

3004
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:06,020
Lucky you!

3005
01:55:07,120 --> 01:55:08,060
Oh, you're so right.

3006
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:09,380
I should've gotten the lucky you.

3007
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:11,480
I'm gonna do all me as well.

3008
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:13,040
Actually, I got wow.

3009
01:55:13,120 --> 01:55:14,560
That's pretty sarcastic too.

3010
01:55:15,100 --> 01:55:16,120
Wow is pretty good.

3011
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:17,380
I'm gonna get good game.

3012
01:55:17,580 --> 01:55:18,260
Good game.

3013
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:18,840
GG.

3014
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:20,360
GG is a good one.

3015
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:21,200
Bad luck.

3016
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:22,860
Or wah.

3017
01:55:23,540 --> 01:55:28,140
I think if you utterly ruin someone in a mini game, you should just say good game after.

3018
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:30,120
There's 109 of them.

3019
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:30,500
Wow.

3020
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:34,020
Oh, you have to unlock more, I think.

3021
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:37,220
There's the one that just aggressively tells you to hit.

3022
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:38,060
I'm taking that one.

3023
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:39,060
Yeah, I got that one too.

3024
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:40,680
Oh my God.

3025
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:42,800
Oh my God, I can buy all of them, by the way.

3026
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:46,000
You played three games.

3027
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:46,680
Haha.

3028
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:49,320
Yeah.

3029
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:52,200
Create your own Mario party card.

3030
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:52,660
I'm okay.

3031
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:53,860
Wow.

3032
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:55,020
What's this one?

3033
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:56,580
Collect groovy music.

3034
01:55:57,980 --> 01:56:00,220
Wait, I have to pay you for music, Nintendo?

3035
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:01,240
What if I just go to YouTube?

3036
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:01,980
What are you gonna do then?

3037
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:03,200
No, no, no.

3038
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:05,280
You'd probably DMCA more people.

3039
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:08,540
Oh, add my stickers.

3040
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:11,940
Oh my gosh, I'm making my little... Oh, Metal Gear.

3041
01:56:12,580 --> 01:56:15,000
Oh wait, how do I add them to my stickers?

3042
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,620
I think you can just scroll through all of them, but you can also do shortcuts.

3043
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:21,300
So you can quickfire BM people.

3044
01:56:22,940 --> 01:56:27,220
I'm gonna edit my reaction shortcuts for all the times that I play this game.

3045
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:35,640
I have a question that's gonna test our friendship.

3046
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:36,960
Wait, this looks like a box.

3047
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:38,220
Wait, this looks like a box.

3048
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:38,560
Girls?

3049
01:56:38,860 --> 01:56:39,120
Yeah.

3050
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:45,000
Are you cool to stay and call with me while I take a shower?

3051
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:46,500
What the hell?

3052
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:47,380
I'm gonna mute.

3053
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:49,020
I just haven't had time to shower.

3054
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,960
Why don't you take us with you?

3055
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:55,660
That is the true friendship test.

3056
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:56,480
We'll wash you.

3057
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:01,100
Or we could just watch.

3058
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:02,460
Whichever you prefer.

3059
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:07,460
Can I trust you all to babysit my stream?

3060
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:10,420
Because I haven't had time to take a shower at all.

3061
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:13,320
That's fine.

3062
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:15,060
We'll hang out.

3063
01:57:15,140 --> 01:57:15,520
Yeah, I guess we'll hang out.

3064
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:17,120
And sit here in awkward silence.

3065
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:19,040
Yeah, I guess.

3066
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:20,640
I suppose.

3067
01:57:23,180 --> 01:57:25,120
Come on, don't do that.

3068
01:57:25,700 --> 01:57:27,620
I'm gonna leave you girls in Big Momo and everything.

3069
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:28,400
I'll be stupid.

3070
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:30,620
You can't say stinky anymore.

3071
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:31,360
I'm so stinky.

3072
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:36,680
Yeah, you can't call anyone else stinky if you're literally nasty right now.

3073
01:57:37,540 --> 01:57:39,100
Stink bug over here.

3074
01:57:39,460 --> 01:57:42,280
Alright, I got the ultimate BM shortcut list.

3075
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:47,140
I've got good game, and then I got the Yoshi presenting, and then I got lucky you, and then I got all me.

3076
01:57:47,540 --> 01:57:48,860
Hell yeah, let's do it.

3077
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:49,560
All me.

3078
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:50,060
It's perfect.

3079
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:52,360
All me.

3080
01:57:52,620 --> 01:57:56,460
Oh, I'm gonna go... You can take pictures, like, in the...

3081
01:57:57,500 --> 01:57:58,680
On the, like, the map.

3082
01:57:58,940 --> 01:58:01,320
And then you get... You have a little photo album.

3083
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:02,400
It's kinda cute.

3084
01:58:03,820 --> 01:58:04,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3085
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:07,120
Time to go look for photos, guys.

3086
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:11,000
I'm putting stickers on my card.

3087
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:11,960
I made mine, too.

3088
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:15,400
When Mata was like, can you sit here when I take a shower?

3089
01:58:15,580 --> 01:58:17,740
I was like, wait, how long does that take?

3090
01:58:17,860 --> 01:58:23,460
Because for me, when I take a shower, I have to diffuse my hair for, like, 25 minutes, so shower is basically an hour-long commitment.

3091
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:25,880
And I was like, yeah, let's go.

3092
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:30,360
Yeah, actually, how long of a... She didn't mention how long this will be.

3093
01:58:31,340 --> 01:58:34,280
Are we, like, showering skincare?

3094
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:37,160
Are we showering and wash that hair?

3095
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:38,320
It doesn't matter.

3096
01:58:39,140 --> 01:58:41,280
It can vary a lot.

3097
01:58:41,580 --> 01:58:43,880
Yeah, because my skincare, like, takes up half the routine.

3098
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:44,600
Oh, God.

3099
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:45,260
Yeah, exactly.

3100
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:48,180
Do you, like, have the whole, like, 12-step going on?

3101
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:48,920
I used to.

3102
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:51,420
I don't do it anymore, but I have, like, the 12-step skincare.

3103
01:58:52,120 --> 01:58:55,020
Mine's... I don't know how many, but it's, like, it's up there.

3104
01:58:55,680 --> 01:58:57,620
Wait, now I can play as Pauline!

3105
01:58:57,660 --> 01:58:58,900
Because I took a picture of her.

3106
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:00,300
Congratulations.

3107
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,020
Oh, you just run up to her and snap a photo, and then you can, like, skinwalk?

3108
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:04,720
Yeah.

3109
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:07,680
Oh my gosh, I'm, like, literally taking her identity.

3110
01:59:09,420 --> 01:59:09,820
Yoink.

3111
01:59:10,100 --> 01:59:10,500
Yoink.

3112
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:12,460
Takes her face.

3113
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:19,120
You gotta hit me with that skincare routine, because as my chat will attest, I am, like, an absolute skincare fiend.

3114
01:59:19,180 --> 01:59:26,600
And if someone, like, baits me with a skincare question, it's like, oh, okay, we deal with the chat for the next 25 minutes.

3115
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:27,080
Let's go.

3116
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:29,120
I don't know what I'm doing, though.

3117
01:59:29,180 --> 01:59:30,240
Maybe I need help from you.

3118
01:59:31,860 --> 01:59:32,680
Let's discuss.

3119
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:33,760
We can compare notes.

3120
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:35,380
I just talk to them about sunscreen every day.

3121
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,160
Yes!

3122
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:37,600
Wear your sunscreen, chat!

3123
01:59:38,180 --> 01:59:39,620
Sunscreen advocates, go!

3124
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:42,780
What are your favorite sunscreens?

3125
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:45,320
Oh, man.

3126
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:52,820
If I want one that doesn't cost me a billion dollars, the Pure Aqua Rich Watery Essence.

3127
01:59:53,380 --> 01:59:54,560
But they keep reformulating it.

3128
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:55,780
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3129
01:59:55,840 --> 02:00:01,040
If you want something similar, I would try the Skin Aqua UV Moisture Milk.

3130
02:00:01,220 --> 02:00:01,840
I have that one, too.

3131
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:03,260
Oh, thank God.

3132
02:00:03,480 --> 02:00:04,940
Yeah, no, that one, I love that one.

3133
02:00:04,940 --> 02:00:06,080
I have, like, ten different sunscreens.

3134
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:09,960
Yeah, they don't reformulate it every ten seconds, so I like it more.

3135
02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:09,980
Oh, yeah.

3136
02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:10,500
Nice, yeah.

3137
02:00:10,700 --> 02:00:12,160
Yeah, and then for the other one...

3138
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:12,780
That's probably the bigger one, yeah.

3139
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:21,200
Yeah, the other one that I use is the... I think it might be Europe only, but it's, like, a La Roche-Posay one.

3140
02:00:21,240 --> 02:00:22,660
Oh, I love La Roche-Posay!

3141
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:26,560
I'm not here for me to, like, fucking butcher that name, but...

3142
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:28,220
Yeah, no, it's...

3143
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:32,140
It's called the UV Mune 400, and it's, like, a cream.

3144
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:36,300
And it's got, like, the newest European filters, and it's, like, hell yeah.

3145
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:36,700
Ooh!

3146
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:38,080
Yeah.

3147
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:43,160
I think that is the reason why I got yelled at in LA, because this guy was like, You need sun.

3148
02:00:43,220 --> 02:00:45,580
It's like, I've been out in the sun every day, you just can't tell!

3149
02:00:45,860 --> 02:00:47,640
You just get...

3150
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:51,620
I'm just protected in my little sun hat with my sunscreen.

3151
02:00:51,740 --> 02:00:52,500
Two on point.

3152
02:00:54,700 --> 02:00:55,840
No, I feel that.

3153
02:00:56,580 --> 02:00:58,380
I wear sunscreen all the time.

3154
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:00,340
If I don't, I can get, like, really cooked.

3155
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:03,640
Yeah, yeah, I use... I use, um...

3156
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:05,400
Tretinoin?

3157
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:05,760
Tretinoin?

3158
02:01:06,060 --> 02:01:06,420
Oh, yeah.

3159
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:08,880
Yeah, so I have to wear sunscreen.

3160
02:01:08,940 --> 02:01:10,620
If I don't, I am in a lot of trouble.

3161
02:01:10,620 --> 02:01:12,600
So it's like, oh no.

3162
02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:15,160
I don't know what mine is.

3163
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:18,240
I just get whatever's popular at Cosme when I go to Harajuku.

3164
02:01:18,980 --> 02:01:19,240
Yeah.

3165
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:21,540
I mean, that's also valid.

3166
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:29,100
Like, if you're not sensitive, I wish my skin was less sensitive, because, like, a lot of stuff will, like, I'll have...

3167
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:32,380
I'll go red, or I'll clog up, so I'm very...

3168
02:01:32,380 --> 02:01:36,300
Like, I love skincare, but when I find things that work, I stick to them like glue.

3169
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:41,620
And then I see people being like, I got to experiment with all of these things, and nothing bad happened, and I'm like, you bitch.

3170
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:42,040
No!

3171
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:43,720
How dare you!

3172
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:44,320
How dare you!

3173
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:46,940
It's okay, I don't have nice skin, though.

3174
02:01:47,660 --> 02:01:48,720
Don't feel jealous.

3175
02:01:49,140 --> 02:01:51,120
No, I bet your skin is great.

3176
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:52,360
We are our own worst critics.

3177
02:01:53,000 --> 02:02:01,280
Like, you know, I'll look at mine and be like, oh, I can see, like, a little bit, like, a tiny bit of acne scarring from, like, ten years ago, and nobody else can see it.

3178
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:01,940
Everyone's like, no, you...

3179
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:02,700
But I can!

3180
02:02:03,580 --> 02:02:08,420
Yeah, they'll be like, literally, your skin is flawless, and it's like, no, I can see the scars.

3181
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:13,580
Yeah, and everyone has that problem where, like, they, like, super zoom in, like, they stand right up to the mirror.

3182
02:02:13,660 --> 02:02:18,740
Yeah, yeah, like, you're basically, like, kissing the mirror, and then you're like, why can I see all these imperfections?

3183
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:24,040
And then no one's walking up to you and, like, standing that close and being like, damn, girl, your skin looks crazy.

3184
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:25,900
It's me.

3185
02:02:26,060 --> 02:02:26,520
I am.

3186
02:02:26,700 --> 02:02:29,780
It's like, wow, I can see your sebaceous filaments right now, and it's disgusting.

3187
02:02:29,780 --> 02:02:30,160
Oh.

3188
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:32,280
Yeah.

3189
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:34,800
Oh my gosh.

3190
02:02:35,380 --> 02:02:38,300
Let me use my salicylic acid to clean my nose.

3191
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:45,620
The first time I said the word salicylic acid on stream, people were like, you use acid on your skin?

3192
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:46,540
It's like, yes.

3193
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:48,260
Yes, you have to.

3194
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:49,240
You have to.

3195
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:49,440
You have to.

3196
02:02:49,900 --> 02:02:50,240
Yeah.

3197
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:52,440
If you don't, you die.

3198
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:58,320
Yeah, the way that it works is, obviously, you put acid on your skin, it burns away the top layer, and then you have new skin.

3199
02:02:58,320 --> 02:02:59,520
Yeah, easy.

3200
02:03:00,260 --> 02:03:01,600
That's why it's called an acid.

3201
02:03:04,120 --> 02:03:05,000
Obviously, obviously.

3202
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:07,060
My game is bugged.

3203
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:07,740
What's happening?

3204
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:09,420
Your game is bugged?

3205
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:10,700
I already left.

3206
02:03:10,760 --> 02:03:11,440
I got my stickers.

3207
02:03:11,580 --> 02:03:12,540
I have nothing else to do.

3208
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:13,780
I have one Mario party.

3209
02:03:14,180 --> 02:03:14,400
Yeah.

3210
02:03:15,340 --> 02:03:16,120
You've done it all.

3211
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:16,820
You did it.

3212
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:20,040
What if Matara's not taking a shower?

3213
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:22,820
What if she takes a bath and just, like, leaves us?

3214
02:03:23,220 --> 02:03:23,560
Oh my God.

3215
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:26,080
I don't doubt it.

3216
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:28,260
I don't doubt it at all.

3217
02:03:30,340 --> 02:03:33,880
Like, in two hours time, she comes back and she's like, hey guys, how was it?

3218
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:36,740
And it's like, we now know everything about skin care there was ever to know.

3219
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:38,960
We have pooled our knowledge and ascended.

3220
02:03:41,940 --> 02:03:43,180
My game... Oh, wait.

3221
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:43,940
Yeah.

3222
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:45,560
My game is bugged, everybody.

3223
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:46,540
I cannot play the game.

3224
02:03:46,540 --> 02:03:47,480
What did you do to it?

3225
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:50,020
I'm trying to play the Rhythm Kitchen and it's not letting me.

3226
02:03:50,700 --> 02:03:52,740
My... Actually, my Joy-Con just stopped working.

3227
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:54,520
My Joy-Con stopped working.

3228
02:03:55,300 --> 02:03:56,100
Yeah, you know what?

3229
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:56,960
No longer have skin.

3230
02:03:57,840 --> 02:04:05,780
I actually would find it kind of chill to just sit and play Mario Party minigames with, like, no stakes, because they're honestly kind of little fun bite-sized chunks.

3231
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:07,440
Yeah, actually so fun.

3232
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:11,020
Yeah, like, I think after one session...

3233
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:11,360
We'll do that, like, after.

3234
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:16,860
Yeah, like, at one session, we just sat there doing, like, minigames for a little bit, which was nice.

3235
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:17,060
Yeah.

3236
02:04:18,140 --> 02:04:20,140
It's the same thing with, like, you know, Among Us.

3237
02:04:20,180 --> 02:04:21,560
I don't actually like the social thing.

3238
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:28,020
Whenever someone, like, pulls the meeting button and it's like, oh man, I have to listen to people yell, just let me go back and press the button again.

3239
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:29,840
I want to put one wire over to another.

3240
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:31,040
Just leave me alone.

3241
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:36,740
And then I get the bad guy and I'm like, no, let me just be a stunted person so I can do the tusks.

3242
02:04:39,260 --> 02:04:40,400
No, I agree, though.

3243
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:41,880
I just like to run around and do them.

3244
02:04:42,160 --> 02:04:43,400
Guys, it won't let me do the thing.

3245
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:44,880
It's just relaxing.

3246
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:47,040
It's only letting me use my right Joy-Con.

3247
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:50,600
And then when I press right, it won't press A.

3248
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:51,960
This is my before bed.

3249
02:04:52,060 --> 02:04:53,300
Just let me enter the zone.

3250
02:04:53,300 --> 02:04:55,120
Oh my gosh, I think it was my...

3251
02:04:55,540 --> 02:04:57,800
My right Joy-Con is bad.

3252
02:04:58,620 --> 02:04:59,560
Wait, it won't let...

3253
02:04:59,560 --> 02:05:00,540
I just...

3254
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:02,160
Leave, leave, leave.

3255
02:05:02,860 --> 02:05:03,940
Oh my gosh, it was there.

3256
02:05:04,700 --> 02:05:05,780
Am I on, like, tilt controls?

3257
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:06,780
What is this?

3258
02:05:07,120 --> 02:05:07,480
Leave!

3259
02:05:07,820 --> 02:05:08,100
No!

3260
02:05:08,260 --> 02:05:08,320
Leave!

3261
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:10,720
It's like when people are like, how can you just grind in a video game?

3262
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:11,260
Leave, there we go.

3263
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:13,060
No, please let me leave.

3264
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:14,820
At the same time, I'm receiving very...

3265
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:17,240
Oh, I have to turn my Joy-Con sideways.

3266
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:21,120
Yeah, that's like...

3267
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:23,960
There's certain games that I want to play on stream, but I think about it and I'm like...

3268
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:25,820
My Joy-Con is only on my right Joy-Con.

3269
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:28,240
How do I make my left Joy-Con come back to me?

3270
02:05:28,260 --> 02:05:29,060
I just press buttons.

3271
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:31,980
I'm on a single Joy-Con!

3272
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:32,740
No!

3273
02:05:32,740 --> 02:05:33,420
Help me!

3274
02:05:34,160 --> 02:05:35,780
The rhythm game changed it.

3275
02:05:36,060 --> 02:05:42,560
And I don't usually have many off-stream games, but it's nice because, like, when you do a dungeon in that game, it's kind of just like...

3276
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:44,600
You know, like, Tartarus and Persona 3.

3277
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:52,860
Yeah, it's like that, and it's just like, you know, mindlessly going through, and then I refill my MP, and then I fight the thing, and it's just...

3278
02:05:52,860 --> 02:05:57,740
Yeah, it's just cozy, and I could stream it, but I could also just, you know...

3279
02:05:57,740 --> 02:06:01,060
Try to put it on my Steam Deck and switch off to the world.

3280
02:06:01,860 --> 02:06:02,560
Curl up in bed.

3281
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:05,140
I like... It depends on the game.

3282
02:06:05,320 --> 02:06:12,380
Some games, I like when they're kind of repetitive like that to stream, because then I can just talk over it, and it's basically a just chatting stream.

3283
02:06:12,380 --> 02:06:16,160
While my hands are moving, but then there are other games where I have to lock in a little bit.

3284
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:18,500
There are a lot of little things to remember, and I can't.

3285
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:18,860
Yeah.

3286
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:21,700
Like if there's resource management, right?

3287
02:06:22,760 --> 02:06:24,980
Like a city builder or something, I can't.

3288
02:06:25,180 --> 02:06:29,000
Like, I could kind of stream it, but I don't expect myself to do well at all.

3289
02:06:29,860 --> 02:06:35,160
Yeah, I have another game against the storm that I...

3290
02:06:35,160 --> 02:06:36,680
Yeah, I love that game.

3291
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:38,300
That is a really fun off-stream game.

3292
02:06:38,300 --> 02:06:48,220
But because... Yeah, I could stream that one, but again, especially with city builders, I spend a lot of time silently staring at it and fast forward to see what's going on.

3293
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:50,440
It's just like, this wouldn't be fun to watch.

3294
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:52,280
Exactly.

3295
02:06:52,860 --> 02:06:56,240
Although some people are there just for, you know, hanging out.

3296
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:59,280
Yeah, some people just want to chill and watch.

3297
02:07:00,060 --> 02:07:02,320
I think my game for that is RimWorld.

3298
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:10,780
Like, I always go back to RimWorld because, like, there's enough happening with, like, goofy shit that the game is doing, but a lot of the time I'm also just, like...

3299
02:07:10,780 --> 02:07:12,200
Going back and forth with chat.

3300
02:07:13,660 --> 02:07:14,980
So it's nice.

3301
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:18,640
Wait, there's a place called Minigame Bay.

3302
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:19,860
Are all the minigames there?

3303
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:21,580
You're gonna play minigames?

3304
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:22,280
Minigame?

3305
02:07:23,080 --> 02:07:23,540
Minigame?

3306
02:07:23,820 --> 02:07:24,220
Minigame?

3307
02:07:24,820 --> 02:07:25,240
Minigame?

3308
02:07:26,860 --> 02:07:27,480
We can minigame.

3309
02:07:28,580 --> 02:07:31,400
I already jumped out, unfortunately.

3310
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:34,700
I was like... I thought Matara said that she's, like, gonna do admin, right?

3311
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:35,460
Yeah.

3312
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:36,060
I think so.

3313
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:37,100
Yeah, yeah, she won't be playing.

3314
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:39,960
She won't be playing any games.

3315
02:07:40,220 --> 02:07:41,620
No, she won't be playing anything.

3316
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:42,900
She doesn't need the practice anymore.

3317
02:07:43,940 --> 02:07:45,800
She hates video games.

3318
02:07:45,820 --> 02:07:47,100
She hates them.

3319
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:51,420
I can't imagine.

3320
02:07:51,620 --> 02:07:56,860
That's, like... I'm probably not gonna do a sub-a-thon ever because I have so much stuff that I do.

3321
02:07:57,200 --> 02:08:00,700
And, like, I play a lot of games off-stream, but I'm always multitasking when I'm doing that.

3322
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:01,740
Me too!

3323
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:03,840
Oh my god, she's back in.

3324
02:08:04,240 --> 02:08:04,580
Hi.

3325
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:06,260
I took a really fast shower.

3326
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:07,020
That was fast.

3327
02:08:07,140 --> 02:08:09,300
Yeah, I was expecting it to be, like, 40 minutes.

3328
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:09,720
Yeah.

3329
02:08:10,380 --> 02:08:11,400
No, no, no, no, no.

3330
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:12,420
I wouldn't let you.

3331
02:08:12,420 --> 02:08:18,200
Yeah, I said to them when you left, I was like, well, when I take a shower, it's like an hour-long commitment because I'm diffusing my hair afterwards.

3332
02:08:18,380 --> 02:08:19,920
Are we in for the long haul?

3333
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:21,880
I mean, it's fine, but...

3334
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:23,540
Did you properly wash?

3335
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:25,840
I did a quick wash.

3336
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:27,580
A quick wash.

3337
02:08:27,720 --> 02:08:28,240
Did you, though?

3338
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:33,640
So, it's only, like, you know, like in the Sims where you only let your Sim take half a shower and they're still half-asleep?

3339
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:34,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3340
02:08:35,420 --> 02:08:38,480
No soap, no nothing, no rubbing, no nothing, you know?

3341
02:08:38,500 --> 02:08:40,760
You'd be still underneath a waterfall for a second.

3342
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:44,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I just let the water fall for just a moment, yeah.

3343
02:08:46,580 --> 02:08:47,880
They were still baby-sitters.

3344
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:49,180
Oh, really?

3345
02:08:49,580 --> 02:08:51,740
They said Yachi did a good job babysitting.

3346
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:54,300
Did we do a good job, everybody?

3347
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:55,380
You're just saying that.

3348
02:08:55,900 --> 02:08:58,700
We told Chat to use sunscreen because it's important.

3349
02:08:58,980 --> 02:08:59,220
Yeah.

3350
02:09:01,420 --> 02:09:02,960
Hey, I haven't seen most of these.

3351
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:09,720
There are a lot, like, over the years, there are a lot of Mario Party minigames, like, a lot of the time...

3352
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:10,060
Oh, yeah.

3353
02:09:10,620 --> 02:09:16,080
I only really play when I get invited to play, so pretty much every time it's a brand new set of minigames.

3354
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:17,120
Same, same.

3355
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:22,140
I never played Mario Party until I became a VTuber.

3356
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:26,880
I think my first Mario Party was actually, like, two years ago.

3357
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:27,920
Yeah, me too.

3358
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:35,880
I played Mario Party on the Nintendo 64 when I was a kid, and then that's it, right up until now.

3359
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:42,020
Like, basically, right up until you, like, until basically Mata started inviting me to play Mario Party, that was it.

3360
02:09:42,100 --> 02:09:44,820
And it was just like, this isn't the Mario Party I remember.

3361
02:09:45,660 --> 02:09:46,600
It's very different.

3362
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:47,520
I played all of them.

3363
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:48,880
I don't know, I really miss...

3364
02:09:49,600 --> 02:09:53,600
With a lot of the older ones, they were really, like, customized.

3365
02:09:54,080 --> 02:10:00,700
So you used to, like, if you go to Spooky Map, you'd have this little storyline going on when you enter in, and then you're wearing, like, wizard outfits.

3366
02:10:00,860 --> 02:10:01,260
Right?

3367
02:10:01,980 --> 02:10:03,180
I like that for the old ones.

3368
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:04,660
Mommy's dead.

3369
02:10:04,660 --> 02:10:12,080
Yeah, it was also nice, because obviously, like, it's all local, so the game doesn't decide to just chug out halfway through.

3370
02:10:13,560 --> 02:10:15,340
Oh, in the way that it would before, right?

3371
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:22,940
Yeah, I mean, I only have a Switch now for only Mario Party and Mario Kart, genuinely.

3372
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:26,700
I very rarely play things on my Switch, unless I'm streaming them.

3373
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:31,720
I only play Switch games if, like, it's only on the Switch.

3374
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:33,980
Otherwise, I would like to play any other platform.

3375
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:40,460
Like, even if portability would be nice, I'll try and get it on PC and use my Steam Deck or something, because my Switch makes me sad.

3376
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:44,780
I lay in bed every day with my Steam Deck.

3377
02:10:45,940 --> 02:10:48,400
I thought for a second you said, I lay on your bed.

3378
02:10:48,480 --> 02:10:49,200
I was like, okay.

3379
02:10:49,420 --> 02:10:50,800
With my Steam Deck, I do.

3380
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:52,040
With your Steam Deck.

3381
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:53,900
Just, like, waiting there, like, hello.

3382
02:10:55,820 --> 02:10:57,540
They're gonna organize it and hang out with us.

3383
02:10:58,900 --> 02:11:00,720
What are you thinking about, Nu?

3384
02:11:02,220 --> 02:11:03,720
Playing Throne Fall, girl.

3385
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:06,500
Wait, is that what you've been... I was gonna ask that as next.

3386
02:11:06,580 --> 02:11:08,500
What's the... What have y'all been playing lately?

3387
02:11:09,740 --> 02:11:10,460
Holo Cure.

3388
02:11:11,640 --> 02:11:12,280
Holo Cure?

3389
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:13,040
Throne Fall.

3390
02:11:13,240 --> 02:11:14,420
Is that the one that you've been playing?

3391
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:17,760
Have you streamed Throne Fall?

3392
02:11:18,660 --> 02:11:18,900
Me?

3393
02:11:19,080 --> 02:11:20,860
Yeah, I streamed it two days in a row.

3394
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:22,460
Oh, yeah, yeah, I've seen this one.

3395
02:11:22,740 --> 02:11:23,200
It's cute.

3396
02:11:23,300 --> 02:11:23,840
It's lightweight.

3397
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:25,060
Very lightweight.

3398
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:26,300
And it plays well with the controller.

3399
02:11:26,300 --> 02:11:26,760
Am I holding a Pikabit Lime?

3400
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:28,480
Because my hands are full of lotion.

3401
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:29,560
Sorry?

3402
02:11:29,560 --> 02:11:31,560
Can you send me a Pikabit on Discord?

3403
02:11:32,740 --> 02:11:33,760
Full of lotion.

3404
02:11:35,460 --> 02:11:36,680
The amount of times...

3405
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:38,500
Which one's Holo Cure?

3406
02:11:40,440 --> 02:11:41,440
The amount of times what?

3407
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:45,980
The amount of times when we were in Japan, you're like, I can't do this, my hands are full of lotion.

3408
02:11:49,980 --> 02:11:55,560
Genuinely, if you've washed your hands to apply your skincare, you thus have no hands until the skincare is finished.

3409
02:11:56,120 --> 02:11:58,180
Yeah, it's so true.

3410
02:11:58,640 --> 02:12:00,460
Otherwise, you have to wash your hands again.

3411
02:12:00,460 --> 02:12:02,020
Yeah, otherwise you've got to wash your hands again.

3412
02:12:02,120 --> 02:12:07,600
You know, if the doorbell goes, oh, God, I'm just... I'm incapable of answering the doorbell.

3413
02:12:07,780 --> 02:12:09,040
I guess that's getting missed.

3414
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:13,000
So wait, it's a tower defense to, like, protect your city?

3415
02:12:14,340 --> 02:12:15,200
Um, sort of, yeah.

3416
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:15,960
Protect London.

3417
02:12:16,340 --> 02:12:17,040
City of London.

3418
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:23,200
That looks like London to me.

3419
02:12:23,460 --> 02:12:24,300
It looks very familiar.

3420
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:25,980
Yeah, it looks just like London.

3421
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:28,780
Is Hololive the Fighting League of London?

3422
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:30,140
It's like Vampire Survivors.

3423
02:12:31,120 --> 02:12:32,040
Oh, that one.

3424
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:34,000
I know which one it is.

3425
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:36,400
The Hololive Cute Anime Girls, I love them.

3426
02:12:38,540 --> 02:12:41,760
Who's your most OP person to play with when you play Moon?

3427
02:12:41,960 --> 02:12:45,220
Oh, I've been playing a lot of Risu because she's good with the money.

3428
02:12:46,140 --> 02:12:46,820
Oh, I love Risu.

3429
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:48,720
She's also very cute.

3430
02:12:48,740 --> 02:12:50,020
She's such a crazy good singer too.

3431
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:50,420
I know.

3432
02:12:53,780 --> 02:12:55,100
I'm playing mini-games.

3433
02:12:57,080 --> 02:12:58,300
That's how I like it about it.

3434
02:13:00,340 --> 02:13:01,260
I'm playing a mini-game.

3435
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:02,540
Mini-game, mini-game, mini-game.

3436
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:05,000
I'm gonna answer an email.

3437
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:06,640
That's exciting.

3438
02:13:07,080 --> 02:13:08,600
If you're doing admin, I'm doing admin.

3439
02:13:08,700 --> 02:13:09,720
Oh, are we all doing admin?

3440
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:10,940
Are we admin time?

3441
02:13:10,940 --> 02:13:11,860
Oh my god, oh my god.

3442
02:13:11,900 --> 02:13:12,240
Let's do it.

3443
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:14,180
Cute girls co-working together cutely.

3444
02:13:14,460 --> 02:13:15,480
I'm gonna leave.

3445
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:16,420
I'm gonna leave that.

3446
02:13:17,220 --> 02:13:18,500
Also, I have an update.

3447
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:19,320
I have an update.

3448
02:13:19,860 --> 02:13:23,320
Already, some folks in LA have gotten their Matara merch.

3449
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:24,140
Oh my god!

3450
02:13:24,140 --> 02:13:30,380
My agent at WME just sent me this photo and said the office has officially been Matara-fied.

3451
02:13:30,380 --> 02:13:31,420
Oh my god.

3452
02:13:33,320 --> 02:13:33,760
Wow.

3453
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:34,920
Are they managers?

3454
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:35,960
I'm not sure what to call them.

3455
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:37,100
It's probably smelly in there.

3456
02:13:37,960 --> 02:13:39,040
Hey, hey.

3457
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:40,460
Take it back.

3458
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:41,500
No, I won't.

3459
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:42,100
I won't.

3460
02:13:43,300 --> 02:13:44,460
Take it back, you little shit.

3461
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:44,960
I won't.

3462
02:13:45,060 --> 02:13:45,800
I won't.

3463
02:13:46,100 --> 02:13:46,840
Oh, shoot.

3464
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:49,540
That was so good.

3465
02:13:49,680 --> 02:13:50,120
My bread.

3466
02:13:50,980 --> 02:13:52,500
Y'all are getting yours soon.

3467
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:53,700
Yippee!

3468
02:13:53,980 --> 02:13:54,660
Hell yeah.

3469
02:13:54,760 --> 02:13:56,160
I'm looking forward to it.

3470
02:13:56,260 --> 02:13:57,580
The posters were fucking amazing.

3471
02:13:57,680 --> 02:13:58,080
I know.

3472
02:13:58,380 --> 02:13:59,920
Everything looks so good.

3473
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:03,000
Thank you, guys.

3474
02:14:03,020 --> 02:14:04,620
Everybody, get your orders in.

3475
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:07,960
I know.

3476
02:14:10,240 --> 02:14:15,420
And again, it was a really, really big thing and I'm really happy.

3477
02:14:15,880 --> 02:14:17,300
They're gonna be here until Japan.

3478
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:18,240
Oh, Japan.

3479
02:14:18,360 --> 02:14:19,540
Until January 15th.

3480
02:14:20,060 --> 02:14:20,780
So don't worry.

3481
02:14:20,780 --> 02:14:21,480
January 15th.

3482
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:22,720
Japan 15th.

3483
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:25,920
You can use your... What is it called?

3484
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,760
You can use your Christmas money for it.

3485
02:14:28,140 --> 02:14:32,820
There is a few things that are getting a little bit low on stock, but we are gonna up them.

3486
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:38,320
And I know if you're European or in Asia or Oceania, the shipping is very expensive.

3487
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:45,900
The big... is North American and let's start through one region and then maybe we can...

3488
02:14:45,900 --> 02:14:47,780
Are they made to order or...?

3489
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:51,280
I think it was a bit of both, right?

3490
02:14:51,360 --> 02:14:53,320
Didn't you, like, have some made beforehand?

3491
02:14:53,980 --> 02:14:55,360
The shower did me good.

3492
02:14:55,740 --> 02:14:55,840
What?

3493
02:14:56,640 --> 02:14:58,260
Uh-oh, I think Matara lagged out.

3494
02:14:58,260 --> 02:14:58,780
I think so too.

3495
02:14:58,780 --> 02:14:59,540
Because she went robot for a second.

3496
02:15:03,660 --> 02:15:05,080
I'm so sorry, guys.

3497
02:15:05,320 --> 02:15:07,620
My Discord actually cut out and I could not hear you.

3498
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:08,460
Yeah, we know.

3499
02:15:08,700 --> 02:15:10,200
I wasn't trying to talk over you.

3500
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:12,640
I was trying to answer your question and you were like...

3501
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:15,420
I'm gonna talk about my shower.

3502
02:15:17,120 --> 02:15:20,000
I got, like, a lag and for some reason, I don't know what happened.

3503
02:15:20,120 --> 02:15:21,340
Like, my Discord cut out and I couldn't hear anything.

3504
02:15:21,340 --> 02:15:22,140
It was so funny.

3505
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:24,460
Oh my God.

3506
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:30,120
Uh-oh, I actually see my voice connection actually dipping back and forth, so maybe the Discord is...

3507
02:15:30,120 --> 02:15:30,740
Uh-oh.

3508
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:33,440
It was you.

3509
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:33,900
Yeah.

3510
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:34,420
Yeah, it's you.

3511
02:15:35,320 --> 02:15:37,200
Yeah, I just pushed Twinkie again.

3512
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:39,320
I was hoping it was just me.

3513
02:15:39,680 --> 02:15:39,840
Damn.

3514
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:42,500
I'm gonna step out though.

3515
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:45,200
I gotta go walk my dogs because they're small and annoying.

3516
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:47,840
It was really fun hanging out with you guys.

3517
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:48,800
It was just so fun.

3518
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:49,640
You're winning.

3519
02:15:49,780 --> 02:15:50,580
Your first victory.

3520
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:51,120
Yippee!

3521
02:15:51,200 --> 02:15:53,000
Yeah, I won for once.

3522
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:55,100
It felt so very earnest.

3523
02:15:56,700 --> 02:15:58,200
It was some fucking bullshit.

3524
02:15:58,380 --> 02:15:58,900
Oh, bye, Mata.

3525
02:15:59,940 --> 02:16:00,540
Bye, Mata.

3526
02:16:00,540 --> 02:16:00,660
What?

3527
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:02,860
You cut out again for me, I promise.

3528
02:16:02,860 --> 02:16:04,020
It's you.

3529
02:16:04,340 --> 02:16:05,080
It's you.

3530
02:16:05,180 --> 02:16:06,880
Okay, I'm gonna go to...

3531
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:08,580
I just thought you abruptly decided that was it.

3532
02:16:08,580 --> 02:16:08,700
Bye, everybody.

3533
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:09,280
Bye-bye.

3534
02:16:09,620 --> 02:16:10,620
Thanks for gaming.

3535
02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:11,280
Bye-bye.

3536
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:12,040
Thank you.

3537
02:16:16,690 --> 02:16:18,670
That was so fun, you guys.

3538
02:16:19,490 --> 02:16:20,390
That was so fun.

3539
02:16:20,810 --> 02:16:23,110
I hope you guys enjoyed our Mario parties.

3540
02:16:23,710 --> 02:16:27,150
Guys, I got cheated real bad, didn't I?

3541
02:16:28,770 --> 02:16:31,850
I'm still using one Joy-Con, by the way.

3542
02:16:33,410 --> 02:16:36,990
Guys, I was supposed to have the comeback.

3543
02:16:38,490 --> 02:16:39,450
What happened?

3544
02:16:41,370 --> 02:16:42,330
What happened?

3545
02:16:45,750 --> 02:16:47,430
The train was too dangerous.

3546
02:16:47,650 --> 02:16:48,250
It's true.

3547
02:16:48,490 --> 02:16:49,790
I love the skin care chat.

3548
02:16:49,870 --> 02:16:50,070
Really?

3549
02:16:50,270 --> 02:16:52,630
Would you actually want us to talk more about skin care?

3550
02:16:54,490 --> 02:16:56,830
I know maybe it's... I'm not an expert or anything.

3551
02:16:56,970 --> 02:17:00,330
I just... I kind of just go to the store and get what's popular.

3552
02:17:01,010 --> 02:17:03,790
Like in Harajuku, there's a place called Cosme.

3553
02:17:04,390 --> 02:17:10,670
And they have like the most popular skin cares for the month or whatever in the middle.

3554
02:17:10,790 --> 02:17:12,250
And I just go and I'm like...

3555
02:17:12,250 --> 02:17:13,630
And I get those.

3556
02:17:14,190 --> 02:17:14,630
Usually.

3557
02:17:20,090 --> 02:17:21,950
As a guy, I know nothing about skin care.

3558
02:17:23,210 --> 02:17:25,490
As a male, skin care is an alien concept.

3559
02:17:25,490 --> 02:17:31,190
It can be as difficult or rather it can be as simple or as complicated as you want.

3560
02:17:31,670 --> 02:17:36,370
But honestly, just wearing sunscreen is the most important part of it.

3561
02:17:36,490 --> 02:17:40,530
If you got anything out of our conversation, wear sunscreen.

3562
02:17:42,710 --> 02:17:43,270
Yes.

3563
02:17:44,930 --> 02:17:45,250
Yes.

3564
02:17:46,010 --> 02:17:47,650
And it doesn't... And if you're just like...

3565
02:17:47,650 --> 02:17:52,110
Oh, but sunscreen makes my face so oily.

3566
02:17:52,270 --> 02:17:52,950
No, no, no.

3567
02:17:53,010 --> 02:17:55,990
There's such nice sunscreens now that aren't like...

3568
02:17:55,990 --> 02:17:58,190
That don't make your face greasy and stuff, you know?

3569
02:17:58,430 --> 02:17:59,070
Wait, hold on.

3570
02:17:59,670 --> 02:18:01,930
I'm gonna go get mine because I really like mine.

3571
02:18:02,010 --> 02:18:04,450
Like I said, I got it at the Cosme, but I can't remember the name of it.

3572
02:18:04,730 --> 02:18:06,010
It's not Kose, I think.

3573
02:18:06,250 --> 02:18:06,530
Hold on.

3574
02:18:06,590 --> 02:18:06,990
Give me a second.

3575
02:18:07,110 --> 02:18:08,150
It's right in the room next to me.

3576
02:18:30,690 --> 02:18:31,770
Pause, join the party.

3577
02:18:33,370 --> 02:18:36,930
I can't remember on the podcast you guys talked about this pimple patch with microneedles.

3578
02:18:37,250 --> 02:18:38,030
Do you have the brand name?

3579
02:18:41,090 --> 02:18:44,630
If you just look that up, you will find a bajillion of them.

3580
02:18:45,350 --> 02:18:46,030
But hold on.

3581
02:18:46,810 --> 02:18:48,010
Pause, come here, baby.

3582
02:18:49,570 --> 02:18:53,490
Little Pause went to the vet today for the first time.

3583
02:18:53,970 --> 02:18:57,570
She went to the vet today for the first time since I got her.

3584
02:18:57,910 --> 02:18:59,910
Yeah, and I was really nervous.

3585
02:18:59,910 --> 02:19:04,730
I was just like, is she gonna be a good cat or is she gonna rip their faces off?

3586
02:19:04,950 --> 02:19:07,030
But she was a good cat, they said.

3587
02:19:07,330 --> 02:19:11,090
They said that all she was was a little chatty.

3588
02:19:11,910 --> 02:19:21,370
And I told them, I was just like, when I first got Pies, I like, think I got scammed because I was like, oh, you know, what kind of cat is she?

3589
02:19:21,470 --> 02:19:23,130
And they were like, she's a lap cat.

3590
02:19:23,670 --> 02:19:25,010
She's so sweet.

3591
02:19:25,110 --> 02:19:25,650
Which she is.

3592
02:19:26,990 --> 02:19:28,050
Hey, what are you doing?

3593
02:19:28,710 --> 02:19:29,970
She gave me a funny look.

3594
02:19:30,330 --> 02:19:32,430
She's so sweet, but they're like, she's a lap cat.

3595
02:19:32,530 --> 02:19:33,770
She'll always be next to you.

3596
02:19:33,830 --> 02:19:34,830
She'll always be in your lap.

3597
02:19:34,970 --> 02:19:35,510
She'll always be this.

3598
02:19:35,830 --> 02:19:35,990
Never.

3599
02:19:36,370 --> 02:19:38,490
Only once has she ever laid in my lap.

3600
02:19:38,810 --> 02:19:41,030
And then also, I was like, does she talk a lot?

3601
02:19:41,070 --> 02:19:43,070
And they were like, no, she doesn't really meow ever.

3602
02:19:43,550 --> 02:19:46,210
And at the vet, they were like, she's so chatty.

3603
02:19:47,570 --> 02:19:48,710
Axel, welcome to Membo Ship.

3604
02:19:49,210 --> 02:19:50,930
I got my sunscreen.

3605
02:19:51,270 --> 02:19:54,010
It's Kanebo Veil of Day.

3606
02:19:54,010 --> 02:19:57,690
It makes your face...

3607
02:19:57,690 --> 02:20:00,210
It's a little on the pricier side, I'll admit.

3608
02:20:01,050 --> 02:20:03,090
But it makes your...

3609
02:20:03,090 --> 02:20:04,930
Your face doesn't feel greasy.

3610
02:20:05,110 --> 02:20:06,610
It's very mattifying.

3611
02:20:07,270 --> 02:20:10,730
So it makes your face feel very smooth.

3612
02:20:12,190 --> 02:20:12,670
Kanebo.

3613
02:20:14,070 --> 02:20:15,430
Kanebo is dollar, dollar, dollar.

3614
02:20:15,750 --> 02:20:16,090
I know.

3615
02:20:16,670 --> 02:20:19,130
It was at Cosme that I got it.

3616
02:20:19,150 --> 02:20:21,410
I think this was 3,000 yen.

3617
02:20:21,410 --> 02:20:24,330
So it is a little more pricier.

3618
02:20:24,950 --> 02:20:26,930
But I've had it for a long time.

3619
02:20:27,690 --> 02:20:28,810
It's so yummy.

3620
02:20:30,810 --> 02:20:32,070
Not to eat, sorry.

3621
02:20:32,270 --> 02:20:32,750
To smell.

3622
02:20:38,490 --> 02:20:39,870
JP sunscreen is goaded.

3623
02:20:39,950 --> 02:20:42,480
I don't get stuff from the US because...

3624
02:20:43,310 --> 02:20:47,110
The US's sunscreen stuff is very outdated.

3625
02:20:50,150 --> 02:20:53,110
The laws for sunscreen is very outdated.

3626
02:20:53,250 --> 02:20:55,190
They haven't updated it in like...

3627
02:20:55,190 --> 02:20:57,430
I think it's like 20 years or something crazy.

3628
02:21:00,110 --> 02:21:07,030
A lot of sunscreens outside of the US have better coverage than stuff in the US.

3629
02:21:09,670 --> 02:21:12,310
That's why I never buy sunscreen in the US.

3630
02:21:12,450 --> 02:21:13,890
I always buy it out of the US.

3631
02:21:15,690 --> 02:21:18,090
That's why whenever I go to Japan I get new stuff.

3632
02:21:20,330 --> 02:21:22,990
Sometimes they are greasy and stuff and I don't like them.

3633
02:21:26,110 --> 02:21:28,850
YesStyle carries the Kanebo sunscreen in case anyone wants to buy it.

3634
02:21:28,990 --> 02:21:29,770
Oh, there you go.

3635
02:21:30,630 --> 02:21:33,490
Oh my gosh, I used to buy from YesStyle all the time.

3636
02:21:35,410 --> 02:21:37,510
Used to get from YesStyle all the time.

3637
02:21:38,370 --> 02:21:39,690
Best sunscreen, stay home.

3638
02:21:39,950 --> 02:21:40,890
So true.

3639
02:21:43,110 --> 02:21:44,370
What SPF is it?

3640
02:21:44,510 --> 02:21:45,510
SPF 50.

3641
02:21:46,390 --> 02:21:51,090
SPF 50, which I think is really like the max you truly need.

3642
02:21:56,390 --> 02:21:57,570
Pies, where did you go?

3643
02:21:58,010 --> 02:21:58,870
Where did you go?

3644
02:22:00,430 --> 02:22:02,170
I think she is hiding behind the curtain.

3645
02:22:05,550 --> 02:22:06,510
Well guys...

3646
02:22:09,190 --> 02:22:11,590
I guess I'll head out, this is fun.

3647
02:22:11,630 --> 02:22:13,590
I hope you guys enjoyed our Mario party.

3648
02:22:13,730 --> 02:22:15,590
Maybe I can... I would love to try a different map.

3649
02:22:16,250 --> 02:22:20,890
Or I could try that map and actually use it.

3650
02:22:21,030 --> 02:22:23,410
Actually go through the map, maybe.

3651
02:22:24,650 --> 02:22:27,370
Maybe I can actually explore next time, who knows.

3652
02:22:28,530 --> 02:22:29,490
Who knows.

3653
02:22:30,610 --> 02:22:32,290
But yeah, this was a lot of fun.

3654
02:22:32,350 --> 02:22:34,390
Thank you Mataro for inviting me.

3655
02:22:34,390 --> 02:22:38,470
I'm glad I could collab with Giga for the first time.

3656
02:22:39,330 --> 02:22:42,230
And Limu had the best comeback ever, it was so awesome.

3657
02:22:43,070 --> 02:22:45,010
Thanks for the fun collab and the bonus sunscreen talk.

3658
02:22:48,490 --> 02:22:50,010
What do you want, girly?

3659
02:22:50,530 --> 02:22:51,690
You're sweet, sweet girl.

3660
02:22:52,550 --> 02:22:54,530
Yeah, you're so sweet, I love you.

3661
02:22:55,510 --> 02:22:58,010
She's so cute, you're so cute, aren't you?

3662
02:22:58,610 --> 02:22:59,990
You're so cute and you know it.

3663
02:23:00,190 --> 02:23:01,030
Yeah, you do.

3664
02:23:01,730 --> 02:23:02,630
You're so cute.

3665
02:23:02,630 --> 02:23:04,990
My tiny little baby girl.

3666
02:23:05,870 --> 02:23:06,430
Yeah.

3667
02:23:07,050 --> 02:23:07,610
Eyes.

3668
02:23:08,370 --> 02:23:09,610
Look at me, look at me.

3669
02:23:10,470 --> 02:23:11,890
Stop, stop looking at that.

3670
02:23:12,050 --> 02:23:12,470
Look at me.

3671
02:23:13,210 --> 02:23:13,870
Look at me.

3672
02:23:14,190 --> 02:23:14,490
Yeah.

3673
02:23:14,830 --> 02:23:15,430
Look at you.

3674
02:23:16,590 --> 02:23:18,930
She's tired today because she had to get shots.

3675
02:23:20,850 --> 02:23:25,030
And I had to tell the vet that she's had diarrhea for a long time.

3676
02:23:25,450 --> 02:23:28,610
And so they're checking her for worms and parasites.

3677
02:23:28,610 --> 02:23:30,610
Which you would think that...

3678
02:23:32,290 --> 02:23:35,390
The shelter I got her from would have checked for that.

3679
02:23:35,830 --> 02:23:36,830
But they didn't say anything.

3680
02:23:37,290 --> 02:23:37,950
I have no idea.

3681
02:23:38,650 --> 02:23:40,490
Sunscreen fun, since you keep eating it.

3682
02:23:40,850 --> 02:23:43,850
No, this has lasted me forever, but thank you.

3683
02:23:44,570 --> 02:23:46,810
Thanks for the fun collab and enjoying all these collabs with Laimu.

3684
02:23:47,170 --> 02:23:47,890
Thanks, make me!

3685
02:23:48,930 --> 02:23:50,290
Make me the pink, yeah.

3686
02:23:51,010 --> 02:23:52,530
I love Laimu, she's so cute.

3687
02:23:54,490 --> 02:23:55,370
Vocal parasites.

3688
02:23:55,370 --> 02:24:00,400
How big of a bottle?

3689
02:24:00,500 --> 02:24:01,500
It's not that big.

3690
02:24:02,820 --> 02:24:04,420
I'll be honest, I don't use it everyday.

3691
02:24:04,700 --> 02:24:06,500
But I've been using it...

3692
02:24:06,500 --> 02:24:08,280
I use it when I go outside, obviously.

3693
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:10,820
I use it everyday in Japan.

3694
02:24:11,360 --> 02:24:12,720
And it still has lasted me.

3695
02:24:12,860 --> 02:24:14,300
I'm gonna say that and it's probably...

3696
02:24:14,300 --> 02:24:16,380
It's considerably lighter now.

3697
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:17,040
But, you know.

3698
02:24:17,560 --> 02:24:20,340
I say that and now, like, tomorrow it'll be all gone.

3699
02:24:23,340 --> 02:24:26,060
I had a shelter kitty who had been dewormed.

3700
02:24:26,060 --> 02:24:27,380
I had to deworm her again anyway.

3701
02:24:27,480 --> 02:24:28,020
It happens.

3702
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:28,580
Oh, really?

3703
02:24:28,780 --> 02:24:29,000
Okay.

3704
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:36,080
Can you... Wait.

3705
02:24:36,440 --> 02:24:37,080
Thanks for the stream in.

3706
02:24:37,160 --> 02:24:40,040
Maybe you can drag people into Dokapon Kingdom next time.

3707
02:24:40,480 --> 02:24:41,960
Also, kisses to Paws and Butaro.

3708
02:24:42,100 --> 02:24:42,640
Thank you!

3709
02:24:43,480 --> 02:24:45,180
Also, Ashes, thank you for the...

3710
02:24:45,180 --> 02:24:46,080
For the...

3711
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:47,060
For the...

3712
02:24:48,840 --> 02:24:50,180
New Joy-Con funds.

3713
02:24:50,460 --> 02:24:51,800
No, my Joy-Cons are fine.

3714
02:24:52,360 --> 02:24:53,100
That was earlier.

3715
02:24:53,260 --> 02:24:54,000
Sorry, I missed it.

3716
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,360
And also, MintyFreshBooty.

3717
02:24:56,660 --> 02:24:58,800
This was from earlier, but I think it was off stream.

3718
02:24:59,580 --> 02:25:00,960
Missed your birthday stream, so happy birthday.

3719
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:01,860
Thank you!

3720
02:25:04,400 --> 02:25:05,440
Dokapon Kingdom.

3721
02:25:06,580 --> 02:25:08,280
I think Matara would like a Dokapon.

3722
02:25:09,100 --> 02:25:09,620
Probably.

3723
02:25:10,620 --> 02:25:11,940
Don't inflict Dokapon on people.

3724
02:25:12,080 --> 02:25:14,680
Oh, I've been wanting to inflict Dokapon on...

3725
02:25:14,680 --> 02:25:16,740
On two people for so long.

3726
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:18,640
Dokapon.

3727
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:20,640
One day.

3728
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:21,180
Someday.

3729
02:25:21,180 --> 02:25:21,260
Someday.

3730
02:25:25,650 --> 02:25:28,210
If you guys don't know what Dokapon Kingdom is...

3731
02:25:28,210 --> 02:25:31,830
If you think that Mario Party is the friendship killer...

3732
02:25:31,830 --> 02:25:33,210
No, no, no.

3733
02:25:34,130 --> 02:25:38,510
You are not ready for the true friendship killer of Dokapon Kingdom.

3734
02:25:43,850 --> 02:25:44,850
Dokopane Kingdom.

3735
02:25:45,170 --> 02:25:45,750
So true.

3736
02:25:48,030 --> 02:25:49,830
I've heard it's bad, but never played it.

3737
02:25:49,830 --> 02:25:55,430
It is the absolutely most ruthless unfair game you'll ever experience.

3738
02:25:55,910 --> 02:25:56,830
It's so bad.

3739
02:25:57,910 --> 02:25:58,830
It is so...

3740
02:26:01,490 --> 02:26:02,110
Okay.

3741
02:26:02,890 --> 02:26:04,070
Yeah, it's four players.

3742
02:26:04,450 --> 02:26:06,450
