1
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,510
That's not even me chewing!

2
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,450
I was muted!

3
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,890
Welcome back!

4
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,990
Oh god...

5
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,590
Hold on...

6
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,150
Let me restart.

7
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,800
Welcome back!

8
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,700
Master!

9
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,700
Master!

10
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,310
Welcome to Peggle.

11
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:28,590
Welcome to Peggle.

12
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,590
I say...

13
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,610
I say with my squeaky voice.

14
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,330
I'm so sorry.

15
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,310
I have tea here.

16
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,610
Oh my god, I can't do this anymore.

17
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,950
Please.

18
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:41,630
What the?

19
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,250
I can't do this anymore.

20
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,090
Okay, there we go.

21
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,730
Very good.

22
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:54,710
I'm a headcrab, obviously.

23
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,210
My voice has been kind of not so great lately.

24
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,150
Which is not good, because I have a concert.

25
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,750
Like this weekend.

26
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,350
So I'm...

27
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:09,750
I'm...

28
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,990
Trying to rest my voice a little bit this week.

29
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,440
You'll hear the pegging sound...

30
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,820
I'm sorry, peggling sound effects.

31
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,380
Don't worry.

32
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,620
You guys have to remember there's an L.

33
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,220
It's peggle.

34
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,820
You know?

35
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,140
I was reading somebody's comment.

36
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,800
I was reading...

37
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,000
It wasn't me!

38
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,540
It wasn't me!

39
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,180
I'll turn the sound effects back on.

40
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,700
When it's time.

41
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,660
Finn!

42
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,900
Welcome to Babusha Vacuum!

43
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,480
Sure, blame chat.

44
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:49,920
What?

45
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,040
Yes!

46
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,720
It wasn't me!

47
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,600
I was just reading!

48
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,560
I was just reading!

49
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,140
I was just reading!

50
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,800
But yeah.

51
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,360
I just felt like playing peggle today.

52
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,500
You know.

53
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,880
You know.

54
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,480
Just when you feel like playing peggle.

55
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,720
But this is peggle extreme.

56
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,780
Which I think it has...

57
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,000
It's kind of freaky.

58
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,160
Look at that.

59
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,100
It's kind of freaky.

60
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,440
And then when you have the sound effects on.

61
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,220
Like who's chewing this?

62
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,440
I mean I know it's him.

63
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,100
But like who?

64
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,520
Who?

65
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,260
Who?

66
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:33,660
Who?

67
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,860
I was just reading girl.

68
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,760
We know what you read.

69
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,500
Oh my gosh.

70
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,740
Do you guys want to hear an update?

71
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,320
Do you guys want to hear an update to the book I've been reading recently?

72
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,340
Or rather listening to?

73
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,280
Addie!

74
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,300
Thank you for the 10 gift.

75
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:50,820
Thank you!

76
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,520
So it's the sequel to the Minotaur milking farm.

77
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,080
And this one is called Sweet Berries.

78
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,120
Such a lust for peggle!

79
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,640
Really putting the freaky and freaky ghost in it.

80
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,220
Yeah!

81
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,140
There's a sequel?

82
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,680
Oh my gosh!

83
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,380
There's a whole series!

84
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,500
There's a whole series!

85
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,380
Yeah!

86
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,260
Sweet Berries.

87
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,120
And it's...

88
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,100
About a mothman.

89
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,580
And it's about a lady.

90
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:27,000
Literally the first line is I'm too horny to think.

91
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:28,920
I'm too horny to think.

92
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,460
That's the first line of the book.

93
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,580
And then...

94
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,400
And then she...

95
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,300
She...

96
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:36,880
She...

97
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,980
They also mention the Minotaur farm.

98
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,420
It's kind of crazy they mention the milking farm.

99
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,220
I guess because she has like a Minotaur co-worker.

100
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:45,760
I guess because she has like a Minotaur co-worker.

101
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,620
And he's just like I gotta go to the farm.

102
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,420
Or else I'm gonna explode.

103
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,140
And we're like... whoa!

104
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,740
I say we.

105
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,280
It's me.

106
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,460
And like... you know... the...

107
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,900
The lady in the book.

108
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,560
Maybe I don't even...

109
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,260
I don't even remember if she was surprised or not.

110
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:06,940
It's me.

111
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
I'm the one who's like...

112
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,340
Whoa!

113
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,600
And then she like...

114
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,460
Has... she's like...

115
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,080
She's like... oh my gosh.

116
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,720
I'm also gonna explode.

117
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,760
And then there's like a Mothman.

118
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,060
But she doesn't know it's a Mothman.

119
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,100
Outside her window watching her while she's like...

120
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,980
Having freaky time with herself.

121
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,600
Right?

122
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,880
And then...

123
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,720
She's just like...

124
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,140
Oh my gosh.

125
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,340
There's someone watching me outside the window.

126
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,100
This is kind of like...

127
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,160
The best ever.

128
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,840
You'll always be my little pegchamp Minotaur.

129
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,140
No!

130
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,360
Yeah.

131
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,620
Mothman out of nowhere.

132
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,380
Oh my gosh.

133
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,680
And...

134
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,000
Um...

135
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,340
And...

136
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,180
So I guess that happens a couple times.

137
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,980
I don't know.

138
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,020
I keep falling asleep during the book.

139
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,540
Then I...

140
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,400
Then I...

141
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,200
Then I started back up where I think I left off.

142
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,120
Um...

143
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,040
And...

144
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,380
There's one time she's just like...

145
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,420
I'm not gonna do...

146
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,860
Okay, this is the last time I'm gonna be freaky in front of my window.

147
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,380
And have this Mothman watch.

148
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,960
But she still doesn't know it's a Mothman.

149
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,140
And...

150
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,360
She...

151
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,780
She's just like, tomorrow I'm gonna sign up for Growler.

152
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,080
Which I guess is the...

153
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,060
Is the furry land...

154
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,140
Dating app.

155
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,960
And...

156
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,260
And...

157
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,200
And so she's like, this is the last time.

158
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,320
This is the last time.

159
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,220
And...

160
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,860
Have you tried out Peglin?

161
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,820
What's Peglin?

162
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,380
Peglin.

163
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,560
And um...

164
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,320
Hold on.

165
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,700
I haven't even gotten to my favorite line of the book.

166
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,920
To my favorite line in the book yet.

167
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,700
Cause I was like, falling asleep.

168
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,320
And then she said this line.

169
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,200
Cause it's an audio book, right?

170
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,520
I listen to it while I'm going to sleep.

171
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,120
And I literally snapped out of like...

172
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,140
That in between state I was in.

173
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,360
And I just was laughing.

174
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,180
I was like, no way she just said that.

175
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,100
No way she just said that!

176
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,100
I'm milking minotaurs.

177
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,160
I don't need to know this line.

178
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,560
You do!

179
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,200
You do!

180
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,620
You do.

181
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,900
So basically she's just like...

182
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,360
Oh my gosh.

183
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,160
She was like imagining...

184
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,920
The guy outside her window.

185
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,880
She's like, I know this is probably a bad idea.

186
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,060
He could be like...

187
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,300
He could burst through my front door right now.

188
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,880
He could be a murderer.

189
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,840
But you know what?

190
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,360
Right now...

191
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,940
I'm freaking so I don't care.

192
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,300
And...

193
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,580
She like talks to him.

194
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,500
But he only responds and clicks.

195
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,880
So she'll be like...

196
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,860
She'll be like...

197
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,640
Do you like what you see?

198
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,640
And he'll be like...

199
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,470
And she just has to...

200
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,450
Take it as a yes.

201
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,070
I guess.

202
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,150
At one point...

203
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,110
I'm like in my head too.

204
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,550
While I'm imagining this.

205
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,570
I'm imagining it not as...

206
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,210
On the cover of the book...

207
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,450
It's like a sexy Mothman.

208
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,410
He's got abs.

209
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,510
And he's got...

210
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:28,850
A conventionally attractive face.

211
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,770
Stuff like that.

212
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,530
But in my brain I'm imagining...

213
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,330
Not a Mothman but a fly man.

214
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,270
And his giant fly eyes.

215
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,430
Bugging out.

216
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,430
And his little mouth.

217
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,290
Like you know how the mouth...

218
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,050
Kind of stick out.

219
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,630
Like that.

220
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,070
And I'm imagining him doing that thing with his hands.

221
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,010
That flies do when they clean his hands.

222
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,610
Because she keeps saying...

223
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,070
I can hear his humming.

224
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,170
And I'm like...

225
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,530
Like a whirring sound.

226
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,690
And I'm just like...

227
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,770
What is this bug doing?

228
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,870
Like...

229
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,830
But anyway...

230
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,350
She's like...

231
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,850
Super into this guy...

232
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,010
From the window.

233
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,370
Sounds like Batara's type.

234
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:15,930
Right?

235
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,830
I'm no longer shocked by what you read now.

236
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,810
You freaky ghost maid.

237
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:25,770
Yeah.

238
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,190
AKA Peggy.

239
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,170
Peggy.

240
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,250
But um...

241
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,570
Is this a man sized moth or a moth sized man?

242
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,750
It's a man sized...

243
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,510
Mothman.

244
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,590
And...

245
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,270
Anyway...

246
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,430
Okay my favorite line.

247
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,410
And sorry.

248
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,710
I have to say a bad word.

249
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,850
It's been 10 minutes though.

250
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,510
So YouTube won't bonk me.

251
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:50,890
Oh sorry.

252
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,430
You can't hear the little birds chirping anymore.

253
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:54,370
Okay.

254
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,650
We're not...

255
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,710
It's literally on the levels of Picasso.

256
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,090
Okay?

257
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,430
It's so...

258
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,850
Oh my gosh.

259
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:02,870
Okay so...

260
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,010
She's like getting freaky with herself.

261
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,310
And then like...

262
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,450
I don't know...

263
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,430
He somehow...

264
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,850
Reaches from the window.

265
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,970
But he's still shrouded in darkness.

266
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:16,870
She can't see him.

267
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,710
But something...

268
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,890
Starts touching her.

269
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,950
I don't know if it's like his really long moth tongue or what.

270
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,470
I have no idea.

271
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,770
But she's like...

272
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,810
She's like oh my gosh.

273
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,810
This guy...

274
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,930
I need...

275
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,750
I can't even say this.

276
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,570
I can't even say this.

277
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,750
She says to him...

278
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,370
She says...

279
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,890
She says...

280
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,830
She says mad outside the window.

281
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,850
I need to...

282
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,950
I need you...

283
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:52,270
Oh god.

284
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,970
I'm so sorry for saying this out loud.

285
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,110
But if I had to hear it...

286
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,470
You'd do too.

287
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,990
She said...

288
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,530
She says...

289
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,490
I need you...

290
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,690
I need you...

291
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:07,710
You'd do too.

292
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,890
Don't fuck me until I'm boneless.

293
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,380
What does that mean?

294
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,720
What does that mean?

295
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,140
I literally had to repeat it.

296
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,040
I was falling asleep.

297
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,280
I was like did she say boneless?

298
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,720
Like a chicken wing.

299
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,780
Oh my god.

300
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,180
I'm crying.

301
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,040
It was so out of nowhere.

302
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,560
I was like what are you talking about?

303
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,780
Like a pizza.

304
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:42,920
No.

305
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,420
Oh my gosh.

306
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,260
It was so funny.

307
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,020
I don't know what she meant by that truly.

308
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,080
I'm like I don't...

309
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,840
I don't...

310
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,920
I don't know.

311
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,220
Do ghosts have bones?

312
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,700
She's not a ghost.

313
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,360
She's a lady.

314
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,120
Like one boneless woman.

315
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,500
Someone gets paid to read these aloud.

316
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,240
I know.

317
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:05,880
I know.

318
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,500
And she's really into it too.

319
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,300
She does such a good job.

320
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,940
But please be honest with me.

321
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,720
If you were having a time...

322
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,860
If you were having relations and someone said I need you to f me until I'm boneless.

323
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,660
How would you feel?

324
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,680
That's messed up.

325
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,400
That's how we get slime girls.

326
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,260
I guess so, right?

327
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,600
I'm not...

328
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,420
Confused.

329
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:37,980
Confused.

330
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,580
Motivated.

331
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,120
Wow.

332
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:43,940
I'm boneless.

333
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,460
I don't understand what it means.

334
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,620
But then afterwards she's like even though she was like this is the last time I'm doing this.

335
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,440
He doesn't show up for a couple of days.

336
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,320
And she gets mad.

337
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,480
She gets mad.

338
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,000
She's just like because he doesn't like me anymore.

339
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:00,860
What the hell.

340
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,360
This guy doesn't want to stand outside my window.

341
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,240
What?

342
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,200
What?

343
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:04,660
What?

344
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,460
But then she's like at work doing something.

345
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,300
I don't even know what her job is.

346
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,540
I guess it's like event hosting or event planning or something.

347
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,760
And a moth guy comes up to her.

348
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,200
And she's like Hi moth guy.

349
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,460
And also this city has laws.

350
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,480
So if you have outward outward genitalia you have to wear pants.

351
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,240
But if you're an innie as she calls it.

352
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,980
Like it's a god damn belly button.

353
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,740
She said if it's an innie you don't have to wear pants.

354
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,620
And so the moth man is an innie.

355
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,920
And she's just like ah he's not wearing pants.

356
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,220
Oh

357
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,060
but don't you worry guys.

358
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,340
Next week there's going to be an election.

359
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,140
Where they'll probably hire a new mayor.

360
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,560
And the new mayor wants everybody to wear pants.

361
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,680
So outward, outies, innies everybody is wearing pants.

362
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:15,880
Sorry there's not going to be any you know any favoritism for those who have innies okay.

363
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,280
Oh the new mayor.

364
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,880
I support the new mayor.

365
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,780
And so she meets the moth man and he's like super duper shy.

366
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,080
He comes up to her and he's like hello hello hello hello hello.

367
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,740
And she's just like hi.

368
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:48,760
And then he starts then she like says something and he starts going and he starts clicking again and she's like you are the guy outside my window.

369
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,700
And that's where I fell asleep.

370
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,000
And so I'll update you guys again.

371
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,420
So I don't know where it'll go from here.

372
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,980
That's about an hour into the five hours of the book so.

373
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:12,660
Yeah.

374
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,880
That's where I'm at I think.

375
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,200
How could you fall asleep to such a masterpiece.

376
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,400
Oh man.

377
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,860
You guys ready for Peggle?

378
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,120
Let's adventure.

379
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,700
Whoa.

380
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,540
Oh.

381
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,620
Oh no.

382
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,480
Oh no.

383
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,080
I accidentally clicked adventure.

384
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,700
I accidentally clicked it earlier.

385
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,560
Wait the adventure.

386
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,480
We don't get the story.

387
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,640
Hit all orange pegs to win.

388
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,100
You have ten shots.

389
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,680
Ten shots everybody.

390
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,900
We should get the adventure on the next one though.

391
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,020
What the hell is this thing?

392
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:52,920
Oh hold on.

393
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,200
You guys for Peggle I have to get comfortable okay?

394
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,660
Much better.

395
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,220
Okie dokie.

396
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,840
From Half Life.

397
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,240
Mmm.

398
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,310
I'm up here.

399
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,590
I'm up here.

400
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,350
Can you see me?

401
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:15,790
Can you see me?

402
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,190
Can you see me?

403
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:16,610
Can you see me?

404
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,030
Can you see me?

405
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,690
Alright we gotta get all the orange pegs.

406
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,510
All the orange balls.

407
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,350
Looking forward to this stream.

408
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,590
I also recommend Pegglin if you enjoy this.

409
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,590
Chat seems to be big fans of Mint's Peggle.

410
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:28,530
Mpeg.

411
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,330
Not the Mpeg.

412
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,930
I'm up here.

413
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:34,890
Can you see me?

414
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,510
Can you see me?

415
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,150
I'm up here.

416
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:37,990
I'm up here.

417
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,290
Hold on.

418
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,690
Maybe hold on.

419
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,330
Can you see me now?

420
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,230
My big ol' eyes.

421
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,630
I'm doing that thing with my hands like I'm a fly.

422
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,580
Minto leaving us boneless.

423
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,120
Not the boneless.

424
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
Where did the ghost go?

425
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,080
Can you spot her chat?

426
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,660
Can you spot the ghost?

427
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,280
Ok.

428
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,600
We're gonna do this first try.

429
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,080
Oh!

430
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:13,800
The sound effects.

431
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,360
Oh my gosh.

432
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,560
There.

433
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,300
Let me know if it's too loud.

434
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,380
Oh my god.

435
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:23,780
Ah!

436
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,220
We were so close to making it in the hole.

437
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,120
Hold on.

438
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,720
There we go.

439
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,400
That should be better.

440
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,520
The Mothman is... POV.

441
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,940
The Mothman is looking through your window.

442
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,280
No!

443
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,940
Bing bing.

444
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,360
Bing bing.

445
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,160
No no no no!

446
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,640
No!

447
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:43,980
No!

448
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,160
Oh!

449
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,120
Oh my gosh.

450
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,800
Oh yeah.

451
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,060
No.

452
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:46,400
Oh.

453
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:46,680
Oh.

454
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,740
How many?

455
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,760
We have eight balls left.

456
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,560
Oh my gosh.

457
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,720
Is this gonna be hard?

458
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,600
Is this gonna be difficult?

459
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,820
Oh gosh.

460
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,360
I have to sneeze.

461
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,020
No!

462
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:09,470
Do you think she heard me sneeze while I was looking out...

463
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,050
while I was looking through her window?

464
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,910
Do you think she heard me?

465
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,110
Do you think she heard me?

466
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:20,570
Bless you.

467
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:20,710
Bless you.

468
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,070
Thank you.

469
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,530
Oh nice.

470
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:25,810
Nice.

471
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:26,010
Nice.

472
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:26,890
Oh!

473
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:27,910
Oh gosh.

474
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:28,550
No!

475
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,250
Guys!

476
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,190
This is too difficult.

477
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:36,990
Oh!

478
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,530
Oh my gosh.

479
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,310
Oh yes!

480
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:38,670
Yes!

481
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:38,910
Yes!

482
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:38,970
Yes!

483
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:39,610
Oh!

484
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,990
Oh my gosh.

485
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,130
You got the ball in the bucket.

486
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,710
This returns the ball to the ball-a-tron.

487
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,410
Thank you.

488
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,790
You got this Minto.

489
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,610
Peg them until they're boneless.

490
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,770
What was the first Saucy Jack book you read?

491
00:21:58,970 --> 00:21:59,810
Was it Chuck Ting?

492
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:01,970
It was...

493
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,030
I think a billionaire book.

494
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,530
I can't remember to be honest.

495
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,570
I started normal where I was listening to...

496
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,250
like Maze Runner.

497
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,270
And I was like... hmm.

498
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,550
I don't know what got me started.

499
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,250
I don't know.

500
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,490
I've just been a little freaky.

501
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,200
I can't stop the freak.

502
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,740
Oh my gosh.

503
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,120
We got it.

504
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,580
Oh nice.

505
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:30,740
Nice.

506
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,880
I was gonna say we gotta get in here.

507
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,660
Nice.

508
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,320
Nice.

509
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:36,720
Nice.

510
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,500
Alright.

511
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:37,600
Alright.

512
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,660
Oh my gosh.

513
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,940
Three in a row!

514
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,000
How are we doing this?

515
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,680
How are we doing this?

516
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,500
How are we doing this?

517
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:51,740
Oh!

518
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,040
Oh my god!

519
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,300
Just one left you guys.

520
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:57,940
Just one left.

521
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,060
You guys ready for this?

522
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,700
Are you guys ready for this?

523
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,760
Are you guys ready for this?

524
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,720
It's gonna be loud.

525
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,920
I can turn it down.

526
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,740
I don't think it'll be so loud.

527
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,140
It'll probably be fine.

528
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:22,980
It won't be loud.

529
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,680
If it's loud, I'll just yell over it.

530
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,400
Oh my god!

531
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,540
100,000!

532
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,760
100,000!

533
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,200
Oh my gosh.

534
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,880
Wait, it's gonna happen.

535
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,500
No!

536
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:44,790
Cleverly done.

537
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,010
Who the heck was that?

538
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,030
I didn't jinx it!

539
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:55,650
Whoa.

540
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,510
Hit the bricks.

541
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,690
This level has bricks.

542
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,450
Clear the orange bricks and orange pegs to pass the level.

543
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:01,690
Alright.

544
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,190
I'm feeling lucky.

545
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:06,950
Cleverly done.

546
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:09,830
Cleverly done.

547
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:10,990
Cleverly done.

548
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,510
Pink.

549
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,350
Pink.

550
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,830
Pink.

551
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:15,230
Pink.

552
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:15,690
Pink.

553
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,430
Pink.

554
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:16,750
Pink.

555
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,170
Pink one.

556
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:17,550
Roll.

557
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:17,850
Roll.

558
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:18,130
Roll.

559
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:18,350
Roll.

560
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:18,590
Nice.

561
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:18,910
Nice.

562
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:19,110
Nice.

563
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,730
Oh, so close.

564
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,510
Actually, I'm gonna start over here.

565
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:24,730
Never mind.

566
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,170
Long shot!

567
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,850
Mothman said it.

568
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,430
Oh, so close.

569
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,790
I got some style points.

570
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,310
I'm styling!

571
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,970
Do you guys actually want me over here too?

572
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:40,690
Or...

573
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,470
It's kinda lonely.

574
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,990
It's kinda empty here, right?

575
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,790
What should I put there?

576
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,670
Is Peggle's story also an erotic thriller?

577
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,530
I don't think so.

578
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,370
Why are there two of me?

579
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:02,410
Why are there two of me?

580
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,330
Voice surfers, please.

581
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,430
I want you to know I read the game's title as Pregle.

582
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,950
Oh, like the Pringles!

583
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,170
Nah, I'm sorry to make you hungry.

584
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,290
Some Family Guy clips.

585
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:26,590
Oh my gosh!

586
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:26,990
Come on!

587
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,390
Get that one!

588
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:27,830
Get that one!

589
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:27,910
What?

590
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:32,690
So rude!

591
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:34,950
What can I put?

592
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:35,890
Oh, I can put a frog.

593
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,030
Yeah, I can put a frog gif.

594
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:38,950
Hold on.

595
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,500
Perfect!

596
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,070
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

597
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,410
There we go.

598
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,110
Okay.

599
00:25:58,970 --> 00:25:59,350
What the?

600
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,510
Wait, I moved a little.

601
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,470
How did I move?

602
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,210
There we go.

603
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:03,650
Okay.

604
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:04,550
Now we're good.

605
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,440
This one.

606
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,640
Style points.

607
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,740
No, no, no.

608
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,640
That one sucked, you guys.

609
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,260
That was terrible.

610
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,860
That was the worst.

611
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,440
The worst one ever.

612
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,560
Happy birthday!

613
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,840
Whose birthday is it?

614
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,300
Star Creator!

615
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,600
It's my birthday.

616
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,820
I can't think of a better way to spend it.

617
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,560
That extreme peggling!

618
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,220
It's an L.

619
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,040
There's an L on there.

620
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,860
Don't forget the L.

621
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,560
Happy birthday to you.

622
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,400
Happy birthday to you.

623
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,460
Happy birthday, dear Star Creator.

624
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,740
Happy birthday to you.

625
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,000
Happy birthday!

626
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,100
How are you guys doing today?

627
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,560
It's Monday.

628
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,300
Did you guys have a good weekend?

629
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,600
We're one day closer to Minto 3.0.

630
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,820
One day closer.

631
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,020
One day more.

632
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,840
Tired?

633
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,140
Nah, it's okay.

634
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,480
Doing alright watching a Minto stream?

635
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,160
It was alright?

636
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,320
Just got back from a wedding?

637
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,660
Ooh la la.

638
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,560
I had a normal weekend.

639
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,860
Normal can be good sometimes.

640
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,180
Yeah, just come chill with Minto.

641
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,980
Get free ball, free ball, free ball!

642
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,180
We got two balls left and two things, you guys.

643
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,420
Oh gosh, will we make it?

644
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,340
Two balls left.

645
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,880
Let's get rid of this guy.

646
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,180
It teased us a little.

647
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,720
What a tease!

648
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,240
It's okay, we can't miss this one.

649
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:33,740
Ready?

650
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:36,940
Ready?

651
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:51,750
Sorry to backseat, but if you get the hunter to shoot an object with eyes felchat rounds, you can throw it back on the gravity gun to insta-kill it.

652
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:53,930
Huh?

653
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,430
What does that mean?

654
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,650
Let's hang in while refueling.

655
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,930
Are you getting gas?

656
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,130
Gas, gas, gas, gas.

657
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,200
Half life, full life consequences.

658
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:15,940
Here we go!

659
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,900
I actually...

660
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,680
I don't know...

661
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,500
Come on!

662
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,060
You didn't even try!

663
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,460
Cleverly done.

664
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,240
I know nothing about half life.

665
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,500
I know...

666
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,220
I'm more excited about the... Oh, this one's so cute!

667
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,460
I'm more excited about the portal levels.

668
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,340
Magic peg!

669
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,400
Are you guys ready for the magic peg?

670
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,720
Magic peeeeg!

671
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,920
There's a half life peggle.

672
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,080
Yeah!

673
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,680
And it's free!

674
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,380
This is free, actually, you guys.

675
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,340
It's Peggle Extreme.

676
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,220
You can get it on Steam for free.

677
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,920
Isn't that so awesome?

678
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,580
Thanks John Steam Man!

679
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,900
Everybody say thank you to John Steam Man.

680
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,180
Dang, so close.

681
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,940
Okay, here we go.

682
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,640
Let's get a magic... Oh, just kidding.

683
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,080
Just kidding.

684
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:19,660
Nice!

685
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,500
John Freeman!

686
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,620
No, no.

687
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:25,980
I'm ready.

688
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,080
You ready?

689
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,120
Okay, this one's for you, Magic Sword King!

690
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,060
What'd it do?

691
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,480
Oh, Super God!

692
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,400
Super God.

693
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,540
Oh, see if we...

694
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,020
We could have it go all the way up and get that one up there.

695
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,160
Long shot.

696
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,140
Or not.

697
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,440
Bing bong!

698
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,480
Bing bong!

699
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:51,980
Bing bong!

700
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,240
Bing bong!

701
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:53,600
Bing!

702
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,940
I just noticed this one right here.

703
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,120
Oh my gosh.

704
00:30:59,320 --> 00:30:59,520
Okay.

705
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,200
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

706
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,440
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice.

707
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:05,860
Oh!

708
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,060
That might have been my best shot ever.

709
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,200
What is this thing called?

710
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,140
Wait, is this the head crab in the background?

711
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,120
I'm cooking.

712
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,440
Yeah, that was such a good shot.

713
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,540
Holy moly.

714
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,530
Little head crab.

715
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,150
He's crunching on you.

716
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,390
You know what this would make?

717
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,950
A good popcorn box.

718
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,330
A popcorn bucket.

719
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,530
Like if you agree.

720
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:43,210
Like if you agree.

721
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,810
Okay, we're gonna do the bounce bounce.

722
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,730
Wait, there's another green!

723
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,410
Oh, we almost had it!

724
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,030
For free?

725
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,370
Oh!

726
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,010
No.

727
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,420
Like the dune one?

728
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,360
Yeah, like the dune one.

729
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,100
Guys, this might be it.

730
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,780
Never mind.

731
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,860
Guys, this is it!

732
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,880
This is the run!

733
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,400
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

734
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,140
Come on!

735
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,520
100,000!

736
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,020
100,000!

737
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,060
Oh my god, wait!

738
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,920
Wait!

739
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,020
No, no, no!

740
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,120
I didn't see- My cursor was covering that one!

741
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

742
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,480
Wait!

743
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:32,860
No!

744
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,620
Oh my gosh!

745
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,080
Oh my gosh!

746
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:41,550
Cleverly done.

747
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:42,550
Yeah!

748
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:46,430
Cleverly done.

749
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,110
We did it, we did it, we did it.

750
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,740
Free balls, too.

751
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,380
Whoa!

752
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,560
Purple peg is worth big points.

753
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,840
Score over 25,000 points on a shot to get a free ball.

754
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,360
Oh my god!

755
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:08,540
Oh my god!

756
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,480
He's killing that guy!

757
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,700
He's killing the peg-o-man!

758
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,060
Alright, we're gonna try and sneak in here.

759
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,400
Yo, there's TF2 in this, too!

760
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:19,880
Oh!

761
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,860
Dun, dun, dun!

762
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,020
Free ball!

763
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,220
Dang it.

764
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,220
But we got the magic ball.

765
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,840
Let's- Let's- Do that.

766
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,460
Long shot!

767
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,460
Oh, magic ball!

768
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,640
Big boost!

769
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,580
Gaming, gaming, gaming, gaming, gaming, gaming!

770
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,680
Nice.

771
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,540
Alright.

772
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,820
Guys, this isn't a game about luck.

773
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,420
It's a game about absolute wit.

774
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,500
Minta doesn't need to hear all this.

775
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,980
She's a highly trained professional.

776
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:12,760
Yeah.

777
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,860
Watch this.

778
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,760
Watch this.

779
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,780
Watch this.

780
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,480
Oh.

781
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,260
It was a tactical retreat.

782
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,980
It was a tactical retreat!

783
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,160
It was a tactical retreat!

784
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,520
Come on!

785
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,580
Come on!

786
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:47,840
There we go.

787
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,060
Nice!

788
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,980
Dang it.

789
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,280
I have five balls.

790
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,060
Half life, full life consequences!

791
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,540
My gold Jimmy Lightning!

792
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:05,960
No!

793
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,800
This guy- Jimmy's- Jimmy's dead!

794
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,180
Jimmy is dead!

795
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,780
Oh my gosh.

796
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,040
No!

797
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,300
Guys, are we gonna make it?

798
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,140
Oh, wow.

799
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,780
Guys, I only have three balls left.

800
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:22,880
I'm scared.

801
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,920
I'm scared, you guys.

802
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,420
Wait, wait, wait.

803
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,500
No, no, no, no, no, no!

804
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,540
We gotta get rid of this.

805
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,420
Oh my god!

806
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:36,560
Oh my god!

807
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,920
The French version of Peggle 2 is full of...

808
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,180
of innuendos?

809
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,040
No way.

810
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,260
Guys, we got...

811
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,640
I don't wanna say it was edging, but...

812
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,080
I mean...

813
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,660
We hit the edge.

814
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,520
Actually, it was.

815
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,940
We hit the edge of the orange piece, right?

816
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,390
We hit the edge of the orange piece, right?

817
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:10,870
Great shot.

818
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,510
Go, my final ball!

819
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,690
Ten thousand!

820
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,430
No, no!

821
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,090
Oh, there we go!

822
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,290
You did well!

823
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,370
Oh my god!

824
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,830
Yeah, heavy weapons guy!

825
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:42,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

826
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:45,830
Oh, there he is!

827
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,550
The ball will head where you click.

828
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,950
You're doing your shot with the mouse wheel.

829
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,870
Wait, really?

830
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,130
Oh, yeah.

831
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,650
I forgot about that.

832
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,910
Why is Peggle Horse...

833
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,570
with a bandana like Solid Snake?

834
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,790
Heavy weapons guy.

835
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,660
Infinite ammo.

836
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,300
Why don't I have infinite balls, then?

837
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,960
Stupid horse.

838
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,640
Yippee!

839
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,000
Oh, oh, oh!

840
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,520
Oh my god!

841
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,120
No, no, no, no!

842
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:28,600
Ah!

843
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,360
I'm a big fan of John Freeman.

844
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,940
Who is Gordon Freeman's brother.

845
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,200
No way!

846
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,920
Where do we want to go?

847
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,100
One second.

848
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,180
I'm going to move myself up just a tad.

849
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:45,820
There we go.

850
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,880
You don't see my big forehead so much.

851
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,640
We got to get in here.

852
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,820
So let's break it open a little bit.

853
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,560
Oh, oh, oh!

854
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,420
Even a little bit.

855
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,100
Even a little bit.

856
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:13,640
Purple!

857
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,360
Purple!

858
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,380
No!

859
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,700
Free ball!

860
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,240
Free ball!

861
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,300
Let's go.

862
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,640
Nice!

863
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,300
Nice!

864
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,040
Nice!

865
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,400
Nice!

866
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:24,580
Nice!

867
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,200
Oh!

868
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:27,840
Bank.

869
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,820
If I go in here...

870
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,760
We got to get over here, too.

871
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,480
Oh, there's so many options.

872
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,400
She's goaded, Your Honor.

873
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,080
I know.

874
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,000
We still have eight balls.

875
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,720
We're pretty good.

876
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,980
But there's still a lot left.

877
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,140
Okay.

878
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,460
I'm just going to have to get rid of this one.

879
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,940
And hope for the best.

880
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,200
Come on!

881
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:03,920
Yeah!

882
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,320
Yeah!

883
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:04,600
Yeah!

884
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,060
Wow!

885
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:05,780
Wow!

886
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:07,560
Guys!

887
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,060
We're killing it.

888
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,700
For real.

889
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:13,700
Long shot!

890
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,780
Long shot!

891
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,120
Oh!

892
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:18,900
Six balls.

893
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,500
Six balls.

894
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,100
Six balls.

895
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,400
Six balls.

896
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:26,330
Okay.

897
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,130
I'm going to do this.

898
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:28,370
Okay.

899
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,410
And then bring it back.

900
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:29,770
Bring it back.

901
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:30,010
Nice.

902
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:30,210
Nice.

903
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:30,350
Nice.

904
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:30,770
Oh.

905
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,050
That was not so good.

906
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,050
Vivica, I thank you for the gift.

907
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:35,970
Thank you.

908
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:39,170
Oh!

909
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,050
I didn't even see that.

910
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,090
Free ball.

911
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,210
You guys were killing it.

912
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,650
Oh!

913
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:47,670
Four ball.

914
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:51,970
Oh my god!

915
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,370
Oh my god!

916
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,010
Did you see the new game Mouthwashing?

917
00:39:59,010 --> 00:39:59,850
I saw Laimu play.

918
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,670
Might be a good choice for Spooktober.

919
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:03,830
Overwhelmingly positive.

920
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:04,910
And short.

921
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:06,750
Mouthwashing?

922
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,030
What does that entail?

923
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,390
Oh!

924
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,810
What a waste.

925
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,470
Oh!

926
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,230
Oh!

927
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,380
100,000!

928
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,220
100,000!

929
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,590
Weird sci-fi horror game.

930
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,050
You did well!

931
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,170
Thank you, Happy!

932
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,470
You did well!

933
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,350
The dire situation gets dire-er.

934
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:43,430
Oh dear.

935
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,850
These awful monsters are everywhere.

936
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,490
There's no turning back now, friends.

937
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,290
We've got to give them everything we've got.

938
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,250
Shoot balls!

939
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,450
Make bounces!

940
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,030
Extreme fever is our only hope.

941
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,590
The creatures are advancing faster than we thought.

942
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,550
The sentry guns are our only chance to secure the perimeter.

943
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:01,330
Oh my god.

944
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:03,810
Um...

945
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:10,910
You can't see his face because it's behind me, but he looks so excited to murder.

946
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,970
Honestly, same.

947
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,990
Who knew that Peggle got so serious?

948
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:19,810
Ah!

949
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:20,530
Ah!

950
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,210
Nyah!

951
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,150
Nyah!

952
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:30,310
Nyah!

953
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:30,350
Nyah!

954
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:31,850
Get in there.

955
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,510
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll!

956
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,970
Oh my gosh, you got everything but the orange.

957
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,370
So extreme you mean.

958
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:41,750
Yes!

959
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,170
So extreme.

960
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,950
Pink, bonk, pink, bonk!

961
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,230
Free ball, free ball!

962
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,600
We need to get in like here.

963
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,240
Yeah, like that.

964
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,160
Yeah, yeah.

965
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,360
A little, ugh.

966
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,040
Okay.

967
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,400
Oh, could've gone better.

968
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,480
I could've gone better.

969
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,080
Nice.

970
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,700
Guys, I'm scared.

971
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,360
This BGM sounds like it's from Homestar Runner.

972
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,440
Does it?

973
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,480
Bounce, bounce, bounce.

974
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,360
Disappear.

975
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:32,700
Nevermind.

976
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,040
Oh.

977
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:35,720
Ugh!

978
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,740
Guys, we've only got four balls left and we got a lot to get.

979
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,830
Three balls left!

980
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,530
You guys, I'm scared.

981
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:49,690
I don't know if we'll make it.

982
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:53,050
Why aren't you making the most optimal throw every time?

983
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:53,970
Cause I'm throwing!

984
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:55,350
I am throwing!

985
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,510
Oh my god, no.

986
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,050
No, no.

987
00:42:58,850 --> 00:42:59,630
Oh no!

988
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,030
No!

989
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:02,610
Oh my god.

990
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,410
Are you kidding me?

991
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,430
It's so over.

992
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,510
It's so over!

993
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:10,070
No!

994
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:12,170
Oh!

995
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:12,730
Oh!

996
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:15,910
Oh no!

997
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:16,170
No!

998
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,190
Why is he so loud?

999
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:21,930
He's so...

1000
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:24,470
He's so loud.

1001
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:28,850
Oh no!

1002
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,390
It's okay.

1003
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:33,050
Oh, we get different music this time.

1004
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,410
Wow, they're all concentrated right here.

1005
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:40,490
Joseph Joestar?

1006
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,090
Oh my gosh, you know what I watched last night?

1007
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,370
I watched the...

1008
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,610
This has nothing to do with JoJo, but...

1009
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:48,950
I watched...

1010
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:51,170
The Parkour Civilization.

1011
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,730
I finally watched The Parkour Civilization.

1012
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,320
I haven't watched the second one though.

1013
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,230
Would you jump for the beef?

1014
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:12,270
Yeah, every time.

1015
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:15,630
I would.

1016
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,610
I'd jump for the beef.

1017
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:24,190
I would make it.

1018
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,270
I would make it every time.

1019
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:30,590
Trust.

1020
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:31,310
Trust.

1021
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:32,030
Trust.

1022
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,390
Did you watch the two movies?

1023
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:37,170
Only the first one.

1024
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,070
I didn't watch the second one yet.

1025
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,430
So no spoilers.

1026
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,650
Oh my gosh, what a horrible...

1027
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,470
Oh my god, what a horrible...

1028
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:47,690
Oh my god, you guys.

1029
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:48,550
That was so bad.

1030
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:50,690
Hopefully...

1031
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:53,270
Okay, the hope bounces all the way back over here.

1032
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:00,610
Oh my god.

1033
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:01,490
Oh my god!

1034
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:03,650
Nice!

1035
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:04,990
Oh wow!

1036
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,510
Have I watched Joker 2?

1037
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:09,530
No.

1038
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,770
I heard it's like...

1039
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,060
Have you watched Joker 2?

1040
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,990
Have you watched Joker 2?

1041
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,330
Yeah, I accept Parkour's payments.

1042
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:29,270
In fact, don't super chat me ever again.

1043
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,990
Only Parkour donos to me from now on.

1044
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:32,070
Only Parkour donos to me from now on.

1045
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:32,330
Thank you.

1046
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:37,210
Okay.

1047
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:37,750
Okay.

1048
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,660
I didn't even say Joker 1.

1049
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,600
I didn't even say Joker 1.

1050
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,180
I liked Joker.

1051
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,340
I think it was like a little...

1052
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,240
Maybe overhyped just a bit.

1053
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,260
But I still liked it.

1054
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,220
I wasn't like...

1055
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,180
Oh, this is so bad.

1056
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,000
I was like...

1057
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,600
Yeah, this is...

1058
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,080
This is good.

1059
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:09,430
But...

1060
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:10,410
Okay.

1061
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,490
Guys, we only have four balls left.

1062
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:13,210
I need to lock in.

1063
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:16,090
Oh my gosh.

1064
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:17,230
Yes!

1065
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:18,570
Free ball!

1066
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,530
Oh my gosh, thank goodness.

1067
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,330
Okay, we have four balls.

1068
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:30,710
But I heard the new one just turns into a straight up musical.

1069
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:31,690
But you know me.

1070
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:34,250
I don't dislike a musical, but...

1071
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,620
Shoot 525 o'clock.

1072
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,640
25.

1073
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,240
Like this?

1074
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,040
Like this?

1075
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,520
Guys!

1076
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,380
Thank you!

1077
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,680
I tip you with one block vertical jump.

1078
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,060
You call that a tip?

1079
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:04,860
No, I'm just kidding.

1080
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,040
That's for babies.

1081
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,800
Here's my one block triple spin...

1082
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,340
Triple back spin peg champ swirl.

1083
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,760
With a stink hop.

1084
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,360
What does this get me, man?

1085
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,460
You didn't have to pay so much.

1086
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,280
What are you talking about?

1087
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,200
Oh my god!

1088
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,740
You get a mansion!

1089
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:29,090
Keep having fun, Minto!

1090
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:29,710
Thank you!

1091
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:30,750
Thanks for three months!

1092
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:33,110
100!

1093
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:38,190
No!

1094
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:38,810
More!

1095
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:39,430
No!

1096
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,520
It went...

1097
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,560
You did well!

1098
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,100
You did well!

1099
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,380
Three block backwards 360 parkour dono.

1100
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:51,800
Wow!

1101
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,700
You guys are so generous today!

1102
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,240
Thank you!

1103
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,740
Thank you!

1104
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,620
Oh my god!

1105
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,060
Boom!

1106
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,060
Falls into the void.

1107
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,520
You did well!

1108
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,720
You've got to use your head.

1109
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:13,040
While you're at it, try to deny our invaders the use of theirs.

1110
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:14,880
Boom!

1111
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,540
Boom!

1112
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,420
Boom!

1113
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,480
Boom, baby!

1114
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:18,660
Boom!

1115
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:22,640
Boom!

1116
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:22,640
Boom!

1117
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:22,940
Oh, nice.

1118
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,800
This is the optimal...

1119
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,420
Well, it would have been.

1120
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,220
If I had gone in.

1121
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,920
But it would have been the optimal shot.

1122
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,440
The optimal shot!

1123
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:31,520
Boom!

1124
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,860
Oh, that kind of sucked.

1125
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,920
This one seems tricky.

1126
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:38,900
Boom!

1127
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:42,080
Nice!

1128
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:42,240
Nice.

1129
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,160
Bonus ball!

1130
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,140
I think?

1131
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,320
Did I get a bonus ball?

1132
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:49,320
I think?

1133
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,540
I think it's Dust 1.

1134
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,920
You guys are speaking in riddles to me.

1135
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,460
This is how...

1136
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,020
Nice!

1137
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,840
This is how you guys feel when I talk about anything idle?

1138
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,220
You're just like, this is...

1139
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,240
What are you talking about?

1140
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:13,840
Dust 2?

1141
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:17,100
This is obviously Dust 1, you fake fan!

1142
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,560
I recognize those particles.

1143
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:22,900
Yes.

1144
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,320
It's a Counter-Strike map.

1145
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:29,700
What?

1146
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,700
How is there Counter-Strike?

1147
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,820
Oh my god, that one really was bad.

1148
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,260
You guys, that one was so bad!

1149
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,540
Okay, I'm gonna have to...

1150
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:40,860
I'm gonna have to hope we get a bonus.

1151
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,200
Yes!

1152
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:42,920
Please!

1153
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:43,520
More!

1154
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:44,560
Yes!

1155
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:46,580
Free ball!

1156
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,900
Free ball, free ball, free ball.

1157
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,900
Oh, that was good.

1158
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,280
Could have been better.

1159
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,400
But it was good.

1160
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:06,430
Guys, I think we'll make it!

1161
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:07,110
I think we'll make it!

1162
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:10,510
We're making it out of the...

1163
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:14,870
Out of the noob... the parkour noob... zone with this.

1164
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:18,770
I think.

1165
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:19,490
Oh god.

1166
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:20,350
Oh god.

1167
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:21,950
Three balls!

1168
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,050
Oh, yeah, we're fine.

1169
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:23,490
Never mind.

1170
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:25,750
Oh!

1171
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:26,710
Oh!

1172
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:30,410
A classic rim job.

1173
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:31,010
No!

1174
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:33,710
At

1175
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,380
what point...

1176
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,820
I actually didn't notice what score I got.

1177
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,620
Style point...

1178
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:50,720
Wait.

1179
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,120
Oh, I got 50,000!

1180
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,040
Maybe?

1181
00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:59,990
You guys, that's not an L.

1182
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:02,350
10,000 is the L.

1183
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:03,550
Oh, it was 10,000?

1184
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:04,190
Why?

1185
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:05,490
Why does it say 50,000?

1186
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:09,310
I'm gonna say...

1187
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:12,050
It landed in 10,000.

1188
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:13,770
No...

1189
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:18,690
These dreaded portals complicate matters considerably.

1190
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:20,970
Use my super guide to navigate...

1191
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:21,450
Wait, there's...

1192
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:21,990
Oh my god.

1193
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:23,230
Wait, there's actual portals.

1194
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:25,170
Oh my god.

1195
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:26,950
Wait, there's actual...

1196
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:27,850
The portals work?

1197
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:29,870
How is this free?

1198
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:31,870
This is so awesome.

1199
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:34,370
Whoa!

1200
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,270
I hate this game.

1201
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,130
What the hell?

1202
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:39,910
It went straight through.

1203
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:43,430
You...

1204
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:44,810
Jerk.

1205
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:49,430
Oh my god.

1206
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:51,770
Lucky bounce.

1207
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,110
Let's just clear these out of the way, right?

1208
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:57,450
Nice.

1209
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,570
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice.

1210
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,030
Look how cute...

1211
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:02,190
I love the turrets, actually.

1212
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,170
I mean, they're obviously so annoying.

1213
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:06,250
But the turrets are so cute.

1214
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:17,010
I got the free ball anyway.

1215
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:18,030
Holy cow.

1216
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:19,790
Wait, so if I like...

1217
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:20,130
Oh...

1218
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,310
What the hell?

1219
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:24,850
Oh, this is a part two.

1220
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:25,810
Oh my god.

1221
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:29,970
Okay, it'll hit...

1222
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:31,130
That...

1223
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:32,430
Oh...

1224
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:32,970
Oh!

1225
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:33,970
Portal!

1226
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:34,670
Ah!

1227
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:35,830
Portal!

1228
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:36,330
Oh my gosh.

1229
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:37,370
So awesome.

1230
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,090
Okay.

1231
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:42,890
I wonder if the other characters...

1232
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:44,510
If we'll only have Super Guide, you know?

1233
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,490
Or if the other characters are in this too.

1234
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:52,730
Hmm.

1235
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,030
There we go.

1236
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:56,470
Like that!

1237
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,890
Come on, shy free ball!

1238
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:02,490
I am a gamer!

1239
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:06,670
I'm gaming, I'm gaming, I'm gaming.

1240
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:08,970
Oh...

1241
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:09,290
Oh...

1242
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,570
Okay, we're going to make it into the hole.

1243
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:13,970
Dang it!

1244
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:15,370
No!

1245
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:18,130
Oh my god.

1246
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,770
How am I gaming so hard though?

1247
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:25,230
Yes!

1248
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:27,310
Orange attack!

1249
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:29,450
Guys!

1250
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:30,650
Oh my gosh.

1251
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:33,090
I have just one left...

1252
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:34,390
and eight balls.

1253
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:35,870
Are you kidding me?

1254
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:38,050
Are you kidding me?

1255
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:43,770
I know that might have looked stupid, but...

1256
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,330
I wanted the extra points.

1257
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:52,090
Gaming, gaming, extreme fever!

1258
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,070
Every time!

1259
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,310
Why can't I at least get...

1260
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:01,970
GLaDOS!

1261
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,830
Once again, excellent work.

1262
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,910
It makes me want to play Portal again.

1263
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,830
The portals are multiplying at a geometric rate.

1264
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:21,350
Choose your shots carefully and pay attention to your timing.

1265
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:22,470
Okay.

1266
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:24,510
Oh...

1267
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,030
Oh...

1268
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:29,990
Okay, let's just go for it.

1269
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:32,850
Timing shmiming.

1270
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:34,490
I don't need timing.

1271
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:35,610
See?

1272
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:38,250
It's all about gamer instinct.

1273
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:39,410
IP!

1274
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:44,110
It's all about the gamer instinct.

1275
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:52,430
Yeah.

1276
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:54,210
Gamer.

1277
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:56,070
Gamer instinct.

1278
00:54:58,910 --> 00:54:59,590
Nice.

1279
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,690
Nice, nice, nice!

1280
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:05,430
Free ball.

1281
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:07,170
Free ball, free ball, free ball...

1282
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:07,730
Left.

1283
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:09,990
What?

1284
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:11,930
I have to go all the way through there?

1285
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:13,570
Oh my god, this is craziness.

1286
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,020
My instincts as a gamer.

1287
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,920
My instincts as a gamer.

1288
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,620
That was insane.

1289
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,380
That was the craziness.

1290
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,420
That was not good.

1291
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:50,140
That one was sub-optimal maybe.

1292
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,120
Okay, physics, help me out.

1293
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,120
There we go.

1294
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:57,580
Guys,

1295
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:01,100
wait.

1296
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,020
How am I supposed to get these three?

1297
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,560
Oh my god, do you see that?

1298
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,660
It just leads straight down.

1299
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,340
I need to go like...

1300
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:20,140
Okay.

1301
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,280
Use the balls.

1302
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,300
Oh no, I don't have my...

1303
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,220
I don't have my guide anymore.

1304
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,860
Okay, let's try the other direction.

1305
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:33,900
Nice.

1306
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,480
Guys, I was gaming so much, I can't lose this.

1307
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:44,940
Gotta get rid of that...

1308
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,560
No, I don't think the one in the middle is...

1309
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,500
The one in the middle is fine.

1310
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:49,600
Because we need stuff to bounce off of.

1311
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,580
Oh, come on.

1312
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,660
If we

1313
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:04,140
don't hit any pegs in a shot, you can get your ball back.

1314
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,120
This is messed up.

1315
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,260
This is messed up.

1316
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:13,920
This is messed up.

1317
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:28,490
Try to get the closer ones.

1318
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:30,310
Like...

1319
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:34,870
Let's try this direction.

1320
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:39,230
Oh my goodness.

1321
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:39,950
Yes!

1322
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:40,850
Yes!

1323
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:41,810
Oh my gosh.

1324
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:44,530
That just leads these two left.

1325
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:45,650
Oh...

1326
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:48,650
Holy moly.

1327
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:54,070
If I can like bounce it like crazy, you know?

1328
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:00,610
Like this maybe.

1329
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:02,090
Physics!

1330
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:05,110
Yes!

1331
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,340
If only.

1332
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,000
Guys, this is... this is too scary.

1333
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:19,820
This is too scary!

1334
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,840
Alvin, thank you for the $5.50.

1335
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:22,400
Thank you!

1336
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,120
Boom,

1337
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:44,990
boom.

1338
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:50,740
Slight...

1339
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:53,180
no, I don't think we can do any straight shots.

1340
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:54,920
See, it doesn't get close.

1341
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,020
Here we go.

1342
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,120
Holy cow.

1343
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:20,230
Maybe a little more down?

1344
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:30,630
Bouncing it off the perp?

1345
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:32,270
Oh...

1346
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:34,090
I don't think it'll...

1347
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:36,530
Well, maybe if I like...

1348
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:37,510
Like that...

1349
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:42,460
Maybe like that?

1350
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:43,460
Maybe...

1351
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:50,800
I am using my mouse wheel.

1352
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,800
That's what these...

1353
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,260
These are.

1354
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,040
Upper back.

1355
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:56,120
Or, I like this blue.

1356
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,540
This one.

1357
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:00,800
Oh...

1358
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,860
Okay okay okay.

1359
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,160
Oh, I can go more down.

1360
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:17,380
Damn.

1361
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:18,680
Okay.

1362
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,280
I'm gonna...

1363
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,500
I'm gonna go like here.

1364
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:20,960
In between.

1365
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:21,640
Okay, here we go.

1366
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:45,310
Once again, excellent work.

1367
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:49,670
Once again, excellent work.

1368
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:54,870
So cute!

1369
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:54,870
Thank you!

1370
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:57,270
They've pushed us back into the warehouse.

1371
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:58,530
Fight, Peggle Masters!

1372
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,290
Fight for our very survival!

1373
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:04,430
Oh, fight, Peggle Masters!

1374
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:07,050
Here's an ice jump for the game.

1375
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:08,970
Impressive.

1376
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:09,890
Thank you.

1377
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,440
Fight, Peggle Masters!

1378
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,060
We're not fighting, Peggle Masters.

1379
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:19,880
It is fight.

1380
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,620
I am a Peggle Master.

1381
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,360
Fight for our very survival!

1382
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,140
Oh my goodness, the companion cubes are so cute.

1383
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:33,960
I always wanted to get one of those square cars and then Natasha as a companion cube.

1384
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:58,420
Anyone else see a pig's face in the blue portals?

1385
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,400
In the blue?

1386
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,180
Oh, in these ones?

1387
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:00,900
I don't...

1388
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,620
What is that supposed to be?

1389
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,860
I'm actually not quite sure.

1390
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,540
Oh wow, that was horrendous.

1391
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,800
That was horrible!

1392
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,040
That was awful!

1393
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,180
Oh, oh my god!

1394
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,080
The portal freaked me out.

1395
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:21,540
No, no, no!

1396
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:22,220
Get this one!

1397
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:22,660
Get this one!

1398
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:22,940
Get this one!

1399
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:23,240
Nice!

1400
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:23,760
Nice, nice, nice.

1401
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,500
I guess that made up for a little bit.

1402
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:32,660
I can't tell what it is.

1403
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:40,570
Don't get to drop by often.

1404
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:42,330
Thanks for dropping by!

1405
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:47,310
Tron05, welcome to membership.

1406
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:48,130
Thank you!

1407
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:48,970
Thank you so much!

1408
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:57,050
I thought it would go into the portal.

1409
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:00,410
We gotta get some of these.

1410
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:04,250
Oh, so close to free shot.

1411
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:07,010
Guys, I don't think this is the round.

1412
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:09,030
I don't think this is the... I don't think this is the run.

1413
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:12,530
Oh my gosh!

1414
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:14,090
Scared me!

1415
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:17,050
I don't think this is the run, but...

1416
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:18,950
Nice.

1417
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:22,390
No!

1418
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:25,650
No!

1419
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:26,590
Three balls left!

1420
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:27,290
No!

1421
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:28,470
Three balls left!

1422
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:29,350
This is definitely not the run.

1423
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:30,150
Oh gosh.

1424
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:32,230
It's okay.

1425
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:34,030
It's okay!

1426
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:39,550
Bye, Zek!

1427
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:40,890
Bye, Zek!

1428
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:41,870
Thanks for the buy!

1429
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:42,650
Get the thank you!

1430
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:44,070
Sorry if I said your name wrong.

1431
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:44,610
I'm so sorry.

1432
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:45,650
Thank you so much!

1433
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:50,410
Guys, I'm not speaking.

1434
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:51,530
Oh yeah, there's no way.

1435
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:58,450
At the Enrichment Center, we believe that if at first you don't succeed, you fail.

1436
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:03,590
Actually, it's kind of worth failing so that I can see what they say at the end.

1437
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:07,950
So true.

1438
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:09,890
You fail.

1439
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:15,130
Oh, nice.

1440
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:18,570
Let's see.

1441
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:22,890
I wanna get inside there.

1442
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:24,030
You know?

1443
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:25,250
Like that.

1444
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:29,450
Could've been better.

1445
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:30,250
Could've been better.

1446
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:30,730
Oh, come on.

1447
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:32,670
That was not great.

1448
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:33,470
That was not great.

1449
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:34,330
That was not great.

1450
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:40,710
Okay, that made up for it.

1451
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:46,350
Frogs are great.

1452
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:47,270
I'm glad you like them.

1453
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:48,830
So glad.

1454
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:52,110
They're really great helpers, you know?

1455
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,110
They do such a good job.

1456
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:57,570
Entertaining you guys in that part of the...

1457
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:59,250
What is the...

1458
01:04:59,250 --> 01:04:59,630
What...

1459
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:00,290
The...

1460
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:00,970
The...

1461
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:04,710
The, like, hitbox, I guess, for the portal is so small.

1462
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:07,730
Oh, nice.

1463
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:11,330
People, my people.

1464
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:19,390
Oh, it only goes from orange to blue?

1465
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:21,050
It doesn't go back... the opposite either?

1466
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:22,470
Oh...

1467
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:25,570
Oh, nice.

1468
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:26,710
Oh, my God.

1469
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:29,370
Holy shoot.

1470
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:31,390
That might have saved the run, you guys.

1471
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:35,410
That might have just saved the run, maybe.

1472
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:37,110
Oh, oh, maybe, maybe, please.

1473
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:39,230
Oh, cow.

1474
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:46,690
Holy,

1475
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,500
what the, what the, what the, what the...

1476
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,520
What a bounce.

1477
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,060
That was insane.

1478
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,700
Maybe I am a master after all.

1479
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,660
I can't lose now, please.

1480
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,460
I only have three balls left.

1481
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:10,620
Oh, no.

1482
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:12,020
Wait, it's okay.

1483
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:13,220
I can get direct for both of these.

1484
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:15,880
It is just the two of them, right?

1485
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:20,060
Last ball, last shot.

1486
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,860
Here I go.

1487
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:29,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1488
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,240
Not ten thousand.

1489
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,960
Hundred thousand.

1490
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,140
Come on, ball, let's go.

1491
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:35,880
Yeah.

1492
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,520
No, turn around.

1493
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:38,840
Don't go there.

1494
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:39,060
Yeah.

1495
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:49,000
Once again, excellent work.

1496
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:57,030
Amazing.

1497
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:01,890
Guys, I might be the best Peggle player ever.

1498
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:05,570
I might be.

1499
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:09,270
No one's done as much research as Mint.

1500
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:10,270
Just look at her library.

1501
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:11,470
She knows her balls.

1502
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:15,950
You peggled extremely.

1503
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:20,070
Not only Mint-o-balling, she bouncing.

1504
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:22,570
Shady, thank you so much for the Akazuba.

1505
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:23,070
Wait, that's it?

1506
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:26,090
Mission accomplished.

1507
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:27,090
Or is it?

1508
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:27,670
Oh, no.

1509
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:29,010
More creatures are appearing.

1510
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:30,190
Fiercer than ever.

1511
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:33,710
If you can't defeat these five challenges, it could mean the end of Peggle...

1512
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:34,850
Oh, forever.

1513
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:37,090
Oh,

1514
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:48,090
the sun is creepy.

1515
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:52,550
Continue?

1516
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:55,790
So, I have to beat the challenges.

1517
01:07:58,310 --> 01:07:58,710
Okay.

1518
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:03,810
Score over 300,000 points on this level to win this challenge.

1519
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:05,790
For this one, I just need to beat the challenge.

1520
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:06,890
Oh, this one...

1521
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:07,730
Okay.

1522
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:10,630
The level has 35 orange pegs.

1523
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:11,910
Can you still hit them all?

1524
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:12,290
Okay.

1525
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:13,790
Challenge mode, everybody.

1526
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:18,930
We only have Bjorn.

1527
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:20,170
Wait a second.

1528
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:21,090
This is so unfair.

1529
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:23,530
Why can't I use the other guys?

1530
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:24,950
They're clearly there.

1531
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,090
Wait, what am I...

1532
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:30,690
Oh, score 300,000 points.

1533
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:35,770
I tried tipping a two block jump, but now I have to do it again.

1534
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:37,290
Now I'm parkour prison, please don't know.

1535
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:38,470
Oh...

1536
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:41,010
Uh...

1537
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:46,270
If I let you go, you can never...

1538
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:48,830
You can never try again.

1539
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,700
Gotta buy the full game.

1540
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:54,980
What?

1541
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:55,760
Full Peggle game?

1542
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,100
I own full Peggle.

1543
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:59,740
I thought this was its own thing.

1544
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:02,980
I mean, it is free.

1545
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,140
Don't get me wrong.

1546
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,340
I'm not like...

1547
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,140
I'm not being like...

1548
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:08,380
I'm not being like...

1549
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,700
Hey, game.

1550
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:13,500
Like, I'm honestly shocked that this is free, because it's...

1551
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:14,740
It's a lot.

1552
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:19,300
If you want to play more Peggle, I recommend Holopop.

1553
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,100
It's literally just Hololive Peggle.

1554
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:22,400
Yeah!

1555
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:24,880
Okay.

1556
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:25,600
Thank you.

1557
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,280
If you want to play more Peggle.

1558
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:30,240
What do you mean by that?

1559
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,200
I always want to play more Peggle.

1560
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:33,260
Oh, wow.

1561
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,300
Wait a second.

1562
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:36,740
I have to get 300,000?

1563
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:37,160
Okay.

1564
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:47,830
Okay.

1565
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:54,540
Ugh.

1566
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:54,660
Ugh!

1567
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:55,560
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1568
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:57,800
What if I hit all of these though?

1569
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,220
If I clear the board, what will happen?

1570
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:02,700
I mean...

1571
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,180
That was terrible.

1572
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:08,220
Guys!

1573
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,200
Oh no!

1574
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,040
Parkour...

1575
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:20,720
You could host parkour civilization map and make the viewers compete to become the parkour I could do that.

1576
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:23,260
Or...

1577
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:28,660
I pick the beef and I end up in jail.

1578
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,200
I don't... is this even possible?

1579
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:36,220
Do I just have to make only like trick shots?

1580
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:39,340
Like, I have to make like crazy shots every time?

1581
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:41,160
Let's see.

1582
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:44,580
Let's have... how can we make a long shot, you know?

1583
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
But also, like, get the purple one every time?

1584
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:47,860
I think?

1585
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,120
Maybe?

1586
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,540
Oh, this will be a long shot, right?

1587
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:51,600
What?

1588
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,400
What's instant replay?

1589
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:01,960
I see.

1590
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,340
I'm done.

1591
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,140
I don't need to see it again, thank you.

1592
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,380
Oh, so that's a long shot.

1593
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:16,540
Oh my gosh, that gave us big money though.

1594
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:17,780
Big money, big money.

1595
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:18,860
Oh, come on.

1596
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,120
These are long shots, please!

1597
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:29,560
These are long shots, please!

1598
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,520
We only got half way.

1599
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,820
And you don't get the...

1600
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:44,820
And you don't get the 100,000?

1601
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:45,160
Listen!

1602
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:48,100
No...

1603
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,480
Blue pegs don't count for long shots.

1604
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:56,180
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

1605
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:01,550
Oh, I guess... oh, because I didn't get all the orange.

1606
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:02,550
That makes sense, right?

1607
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:05,070
Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

1608
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:06,590
Like, I didn't technically complete it.

1609
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:07,730
Okay, that makes sense.

1610
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:08,330
I'm stupid.

1611
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:19,820
Let's just, uh, redo.

1612
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:28,600
Don't worry about it.

1613
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:32,260
Long shot!

1614
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:34,560
Yeah!

1615
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,380
That's playing with portals, baby.

1616
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:43,060
Try and hit the purple every shot.

1617
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:44,180
Yeah, seriously.

1618
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,680
Oh, come on!

1619
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:52,880
Does this count as a long shot?

1620
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:56,900
Oh, maybe that.

1621
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:58,540
Yeah!

1622
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:06,080
No, no, no.

1623
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,600
No, no, no!

1624
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,580
Don't be a shit!

1625
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,020
Don't be!

1626
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:14,260
Don't be!

1627
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:21,800
I don't have a different... I only have Bjorn unlocked.

1628
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:24,920
We got a free ball!

1629
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:26,980
Big news, everybody.

1630
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,340
Big news, big news, big news.

1631
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,280
Oh, that was almost a long shot.

1632
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:42,260
Maybe...

1633
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:49,520
Let's see.

1634
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:51,500
Trying to get the orange in there.

1635
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:54,740
Oh my gosh.

1636
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,000
Yes!

1637
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:57,200
Oh!

1638
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:57,920
Yes!

1639
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:02,580
We have three balls left.

1640
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:10,950
VTuber, why are you bad at geometry?

1641
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:11,790
What are you talking about?

1642
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:15,950
Oh, shoot.

1643
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:17,410
That did not go the way I thought it would.

1644
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:18,890
Maybe I am bad at geometry.

1645
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:26,130
Please!

1646
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:27,390
100,000!

1647
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:28,310
No!

1648
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:29,150
Don't do this to me!

1649
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:47,450
Oh my god.

1650
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:47,870
The bonus.

1651
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:48,410
I thought...

1652
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:49,810
I thought I wasn't going to make it.

1653
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:52,950
I thought I was going to be like just a couple thousand away.

1654
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:54,310
Or a couple hundred away.

1655
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:54,570
I mean...

1656
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:55,070
Cleverly done.

1657
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:56,550
Cleverly done.

1658
01:14:58,890 --> 01:14:59,530
Ta-da!

1659
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:01,450
I am a master.

1660
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:03,930
I am a master!

1661
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:07,310
This area has 35 orange pegs.

1662
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:10,550
That's a lot of pegs.

1663
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:14,270
Whoa!

1664
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:17,450
Guys, we are already killing it.

1665
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:17,610
Isn't it?

1666
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,130
We're already killin' it?

1667
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:26,730
Oh, so close!

1668
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:28,870
That was so close!

1669
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:37,430
Come on, give me free... free ball, free ball, free ball, free ball, free ball!

1670
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:39,310
Ah, so close!

1671
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:42,430
Top, thanks for a month!

1672
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:42,990
Thank you!

1673
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:47,910
Bink, bonk, bink, bonk!

1674
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:54,390
You've now surpassed... oh, that was terrible.

1675
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:55,750
Wait, no, no, no!

1676
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:59,150
You have surpassed Peggle.

1677
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:00,550
You are now Big Peggler.

1678
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:04,050
A small ghost like me?

1679
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:05,670
There's no way.

1680
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:08,870
Double free ball!

1681
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,740
Ooh, I thought it would hit.

1682
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,680
I thought it would hit.

1683
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:26,240
I thought that everybody would be on...

1684
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,880
...my side.

1685
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:36,380
But I went and blew it all sky-high.

1686
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:41,300
Now she won't even spare a passing glance.

1687
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:44,240
All just because I...

1688
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,620
...pegged her.

1689
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:48,920
I'm too... too close to the sun.

1690
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:58,810
No, don't...

1691
01:16:58,810 --> 01:17:02,330
Only two balls left?

1692
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:03,310
I don't know, guys.

1693
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:04,350
I'm not feeling it.

1694
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:07,490
No, I don't think it's gonna happen.

1695
01:17:07,570 --> 01:17:08,210
Last ball!

1696
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:09,230
Last ball!

1697
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:09,850
I got it.

1698
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:11,830
Maybe on, like, the corner, it'll, like, bounce over here.

1699
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:14,490
You jump for beef...

1700
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:16,470
...and rip my pants!

1701
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:17,010
No!

1702
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:18,750
Oh, no!

1703
01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:24,930
We were so close!

1704
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,170
We were so close, you guys.

1705
01:17:29,170 --> 01:17:31,150
I even gamed so hard in the beginning.

1706
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:32,330
I got the ultra-slide.

1707
01:17:32,370 --> 01:17:33,450
I got everything good.

1708
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:46,090
Oh, no!

1709
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:49,170
So close!

1710
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:49,830
Stop it!

1711
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:52,230
Stop almost making it, please!

1712
01:17:54,330 --> 01:18:10,650
When Big Larry came just to put him down Minto turned into a clown And no girl ever wants to dance With a ghost who went and ripped her pants

1713
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:17,410
Stop the clown emojis!

1714
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:23,950
You know those are there to represent you, right?

1715
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:27,750
Doesn't represent me.

1716
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:30,390
I'm putting on the clown, but it's to make fun of you.

1717
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:36,790
You're the real clown.

1718
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:39,770
Oh, gosh.

1719
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:41,310
Guys, this is not the run, either.

1720
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:44,850
This is not the run.

1721
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:52,890
Did I speak too soon?

1722
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:55,650
Have confidence.

1723
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:02,050
Have confidence.

1724
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:04,270
Chat reflects the streamer.

1725
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:06,110
If we're clowns, you must be, too.

1726
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:08,950
No, that's not how it works.

1727
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:10,870
It's that...

1728
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:13,150
You...

1729
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:14,230
You...

1730
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:14,510
You...

1731
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:15,110
Ref...

1732
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:16,530
You...

1733
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:18,030
reflect...

1734
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:20,570
Wait...

1735
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:21,550
I...

1736
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:25,370
I...

1737
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:28,170
I reflect the freakiness, but I...

1738
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:32,630
It's not a two-way street!

1739
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:35,590
It can't be!

1740
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:36,990
It's not allowed!

1741
01:19:44,370 --> 01:19:46,010
Guys, maybe this is the run.

1742
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:48,170
GUYS, MAYBE THIS IS THE RUN!

1743
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:51,530
No way...

1744
01:19:58,930 --> 01:20:01,130
OH MY GOD!

1745
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,520
You did well!

1746
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:20,760
You did well.

1747
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,520
That was an insane last shot.

1748
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,220
I know, right?

1749
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:29,040
We're gonna get through these challenge levels like nothing.

1750
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:30,180
What's this one?

1751
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,800
Oh, clear all pegs.

1752
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,080
Come on.

1753
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:39,880
Get in there.

1754
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:40,900
Keep pegging.

1755
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:42,420
Peggling?

1756
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:42,780
Sorry.

1757
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,820
Parkour Civilization Part 1.

1758
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,540
Watch along in Mint Court on Wednesday.

1759
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:50,480
Why do you say...

1760
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:51,540
Why are you sad about that?

1761
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,160
What's wrong with that?

1762
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,080
You guys should bond.

1763
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:00,040
James Bond.

1764
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,360
Have fun.

1765
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,780
Hang out with each other.

1766
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:08,700
What's wrong with Mortal Movie Night?

1767
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:11,700
Oh, I need to plan what I'm doing over the garden wall.

1768
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,920
That was not a good one.

1769
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,080
Do this and get in the middle of it.

1770
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:26,420
Oh my gosh!

1771
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,300
I'm getting so many free balls.

1772
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:30,140
Awesome.

1773
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:33,140
Oh, so close!

1774
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:34,140
The free ball!

1775
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:38,980
There's a Discord.

1776
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:39,680
I thought you took it down.

1777
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:39,960
It's not.

1778
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:40,580
It's not.

1779
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:41,760
It's a fan run Discord.

1780
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:42,360
It's not me.

1781
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:42,820
It's not me.

1782
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,780
Oh, I did hear... Wait.

1783
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:48,660
Stop Motion Short on November 3rd.

1784
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:51,420
Is that what they're... Oh, they announced it.

1785
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,440
I, um...

1786
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:56,680
I, uh...

1787
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,480
Actually, Leah sent me, like, a... What's it called?

1788
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,880
They're releasing a vinyl and stuff.

1789
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,700
Which I'm very excited about.

1790
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,540
But, um...

1791
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:12,780
Why is it on November 3rd?

1792
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:15,500
Over the Garden Wall is a Halloween show.

1793
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:16,240
I don't understand.

1794
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:19,680
Really?

1795
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:20,060
Really?

1796
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:21,620
Seriously?

1797
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:26,600
Okay, let's get in here first before we go for the individuals.

1798
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:29,700
This sucks!

1799
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:32,120
Oh, free ball!

1800
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:34,040
Okay, okay.

1801
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:34,680
Nice, nice, nice.

1802
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:38,020
Yeah...

1803
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:39,340
I don't know.

1804
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,360
I do want to watch it, obviously, but...

1805
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,300
I imagine it'll probably be kind of short if it's stop motion.

1806
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,320
Who's getting pegged tonight?

1807
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:48,360
Peggled!

1808
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:08,400
Close.

1809
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:10,160
Yeah, we were really close.

1810
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:12,780
Keep going.

1811
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:14,060
No!

1812
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:15,860
You should have kept going!

1813
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:19,620
Oh, nice.

1814
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:20,180
That was a good one.

1815
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:20,720
Oh!

1816
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,040
Oh, that was pretty good.

1817
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:22,500
That was pretty good.

1818
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:24,500
Why didn't you just win?

1819
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:25,520
I don't know, man.

1820
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:31,620
Either they couldn't release it on time or the publishers decided on a date where people have more money to spend.

1821
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:35,000
They're like, they're like, yeah, you got to stop thinking about Halloween.

1822
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:35,460
You got to...

1823
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:35,960
November?

1824
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,940
That's... that's Christmas month.

1825
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,980
What the... stupid shot.

1826
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:51,400
Please, Peggle.

1827
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,840
If we can get these, we can get, hopefully, extra...

1828
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,000
Ball, but also...

1829
01:23:58,740 --> 01:23:59,720
I'll take that, too.

1830
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:04,180
Maybe, like...

1831
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,540
Maybe in there.

1832
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:14,480
That works?

1833
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:15,020
This works?

1834
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:15,540
This works?

1835
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:15,940
This works?

1836
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:23,200
No, everyone knows as soon as October... or as soon as November starts...

1837
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:26,440
It's time to start thinking about Christmas, baby!

1838
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,680
No one cares about...

1839
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:31,980
Anything else in November.

1840
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:32,940
Apparently.

1841
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:41,660
Christmas gets two whole months.

1842
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,340
November is Thanksgiving month in the USA, is it not?

1843
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:49,940
It is.

1844
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:51,340
But no one cares.

1845
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,460
Well, I stand corrected.

1846
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:56,460
Corporations do not care.

1847
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,970
No, they say, get those Christmas lists in, baby.

1848
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:08,550
That one was not good.

1849
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:13,550
Free ball.

1850
01:25:14,730 --> 01:25:17,550
We got two balls left, but we have quite a few things.

1851
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:18,230
There you go.

1852
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:21,210
Will you go for the purple peg or the blue?

1853
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:23,330
Blue.

1854
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:26,490
Last ball.

1855
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:29,650
Guys, we were so close.

1856
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:35,110
We were so close.

1857
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:40,870
Imagine if I had, like, gamed that, you know?

1858
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:48,230
Come on.

1859
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:55,870
Okay.

1860
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:57,310
That wasn't so bad, actually.

1861
01:25:59,610 --> 01:26:03,470
I want it to bounce... like that.

1862
01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:07,150
We need to get it in... like, into it, you know?

1863
01:26:07,190 --> 01:26:12,590
We gotta get it, like, infiltrating the little... the little pegs.

1864
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:15,590
What are the frogs dancing to?

1865
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:18,890
Everything.

1866
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:20,470
Everything.

1867
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:25,050
They're dancing to...

1868
01:26:27,730 --> 01:26:28,130
Everything.

1869
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:31,990
Dang it.

1870
01:26:32,070 --> 01:26:33,230
That should have been a free ball.

1871
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:54,540
Games over be...

1872
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:56,320
The games over be, like, TF2.

1873
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:56,760
Oh, no.

1874
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:57,740
Portal, you failed.

1875
01:26:58,220 --> 01:26:59,160
I have, like, two...

1876
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:00,160
You fucking died.

1877
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:03,600
You fucking died.

1878
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,380
You stupid...

1879
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:07,400
Oh, my God.

1880
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:10,800
Guys, this isn't the run.

1881
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,180
I say that and then I get a free ball.

1882
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:14,980
And it always gives me more confidence.

1883
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,260
I don't think so, though.

1884
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,220
I don't think this is the run.

1885
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:22,060
Oh, my God.

1886
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:22,980
Another free ball.

1887
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:28,940
Games, stop giving me this false hope.

1888
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:29,700
Please.

1889
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,740
Please stop giving me false hope.

1890
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:35,080
Please.

1891
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:35,840
Ah.

1892
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:41,250
Oh, no.

1893
01:27:41,370 --> 01:27:42,190
Oh, I thought...

1894
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:42,830
I thought...

1895
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:44,670
I miscalculated.

1896
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:48,750
Bounce, bounce, bounce...

1897
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:49,370
Bounce?

1898
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:52,710
Oh, I only have one ball.

1899
01:28:20,590 --> 01:28:21,770
What was that?

1900
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:23,350
I was trying to make it go like this.

1901
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:24,430
Boing...

1902
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:25,590
Like that.

1903
01:28:28,150 --> 01:28:28,950
I don't know.

1904
01:28:29,050 --> 01:28:29,390
It's a...

1905
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:29,850
I don't know.

1906
01:28:29,970 --> 01:28:31,070
It was my last ball.

1907
01:28:34,270 --> 01:28:36,250
The purple wouldn't have done any difference.

1908
01:28:36,910 --> 01:28:37,490
I think.

1909
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:41,170
I think the purple would have just...

1910
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:44,290
Laughed at me.

1911
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:52,750
Third time's the charm.

1912
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:53,890
This might be our toughest one yet.

1913
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:58,010
Half Life 2 has a really good spooky section if you ever want to give it a try.

1914
01:28:58,010 --> 01:28:58,390
Really?

1915
01:29:02,890 --> 01:29:05,590
What kind of spooky are we talking about?

1916
01:29:18,490 --> 01:29:19,050
Nice.

1917
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:29,160
I did not mean to do it like that.

1918
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:30,380
That's silly of me.

1919
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,680
That was so silly of me.

1920
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:32,200
That was so silly.

1921
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:37,320
Let's see.

1922
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:38,220
How do I want to do this?

1923
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,460
How do we want to approach?

1924
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:45,140
Isn't there one that's like a VR game?

1925
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:51,070
That's... can be kind of spooky.

1926
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:00,910
Oh, nice!

1927
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:02,730
Half Life Alyx.

1928
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:02,910
Ah!

1929
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:09,650
I haven't played any...

1930
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:11,890
Any Half Life games though.

1931
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:13,910
What should I...

1932
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:14,730
What would you start at?

1933
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:15,230
Just one?

1934
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:27,690
First time joining in stream.

1935
01:30:27,850 --> 01:30:28,270
Thanks!

1936
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:28,510
Hello!

1937
01:30:28,910 --> 01:30:29,870
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

1938
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:35,960
Black Mesa.

1939
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:37,100
Oh...

1940
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:43,120
What's the release order?

1941
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:43,600
Oh!

1942
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:44,480
I was so wrong.

1943
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:47,720
I was So Clooose....

1944
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:48,920
Oh!

1945
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:49,860
Oh my gosh!

1946
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:55,580
Made some lemon potsa pong to go along with my grilled chicken tonight, but I was too slow and now...

1947
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:57,500
It will have to set up overnight.

1948
01:30:58,840 --> 01:30:59,320
Huh?

1949
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,720
Black Mesa is Half Life 1, remastered.

1950
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:04,020
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

1951
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:07,820
Oh, guys...

1952
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:09,660
I suck.

1953
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:20,670
Go with the original, it still holds up.

1954
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:22,230
Have you guys seen the new...

1955
01:31:22,230 --> 01:31:23,810
Until Dawn...

1956
01:31:25,670 --> 01:31:26,150
Remake?

1957
01:31:26,910 --> 01:31:29,370
Honestly, I keep seeing people posting like...

1958
01:31:29,370 --> 01:31:33,450
Wow, this is what old Until Dawn looks like, and this is what new Until Dawn looks like.

1959
01:31:33,450 --> 01:31:35,310
And I can't tell which is which.

1960
01:31:39,570 --> 01:31:40,630
I'm like...

1961
01:31:40,630 --> 01:31:41,870
Which is the...

1962
01:31:42,450 --> 01:31:43,910
Which is the old one?

1963
01:31:48,630 --> 01:31:49,830
Oh, man...

1964
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:52,550
It's not great.

1965
01:31:53,030 --> 01:31:53,630
It's...

1966
01:31:53,630 --> 01:31:55,290
Oh, it's...

1967
01:31:58,410 --> 01:32:00,170
I'm never gonna get sponsored by them.

1968
01:32:04,430 --> 01:32:05,030
Yeah...

1969
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:06,870
Oh!

1970
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:07,430
Oh!

1971
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:07,730
Oh!

1972
01:32:07,870 --> 01:32:08,390
Dang it!

1973
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:12,700
I think they had to remaster it.

1974
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,980
Or rather, had to, quote-unquote, because...

1975
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:18,380
Apparently, you couldn't play it on...

1976
01:32:18,380 --> 01:32:20,940
Like, there was something wrong with the PC version.

1977
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:22,080
And so...

1978
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:23,360
They...

1979
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:25,160
Remade it...

1980
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:26,220
For...

1981
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:26,960
That.

1982
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:29,860
But, I don't know...

1983
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:31,800
It's also so silly.

1984
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,580
I think it was something about moving it to a new engine.

1985
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:43,810
I don't know.

1986
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:45,170
I don't know exactly.

1987
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:46,430
And I'm not an expert.

1988
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:47,450
So, I'm not gonna...

1989
01:32:47,870 --> 01:32:48,270
Really...

1990
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:48,630
I don't know.

1991
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:49,570
But...

1992
01:32:51,110 --> 01:32:52,010
I should pay attention.

1993
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:52,530
Okay.

1994
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:53,970
I'm not locked in, you guys.

1995
01:32:54,150 --> 01:32:55,010
In fact...

1996
01:32:56,130 --> 01:32:57,850
In fact, we're regressing.

1997
01:32:58,630 --> 01:32:59,030
Oh!

1998
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:00,450
We're regressing!

1999
01:33:12,530 --> 01:33:13,050
Locked out.

2000
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:14,330
We're locked out, you guys.

2001
01:33:16,790 --> 01:33:17,310
Ahhhh!

2002
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:23,590
I wonder if they changed anything in it, though?

2003
01:33:25,790 --> 01:33:26,530
Orange attack!

2004
01:33:26,870 --> 01:33:27,450
Free Ball!

2005
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:28,210
Nice.

2006
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:31,430
I'll take it.

2007
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:33,970
Oh, oh!

2008
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:34,630
Oh!

2009
01:33:34,670 --> 01:33:35,050
Nice!

2010
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:37,950
Mmm.

2011
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:43,770
Oh, come on!

2012
01:33:43,810 --> 01:33:44,290
Come on!

2013
01:33:44,290 --> 01:33:44,670
Come on!

2014
01:33:45,710 --> 01:33:47,730
And it avoided literally everything in there!

2015
01:33:48,830 --> 01:33:50,110
You sucker, you...

2016
01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:52,190
Trying to go for the...

2017
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:54,990
purple one, so maybe I can get a free ball!

2018
01:33:55,350 --> 01:33:56,510
Double free ball!

2019
01:33:58,670 --> 01:34:01,130
Seems like they changed some stuff, like music and camera angles.

2020
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:01,570
Oh, really?

2021
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,000
I don't think I'll...

2022
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,400
play it, let alone stream it, though.

2023
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:15,400
If you were wondering.

2024
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:20,180
But...

2025
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:20,400
Oh!

2026
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:25,460
But you know.

2027
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:28,960
Then there's also the...

2028
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:29,140
What?

2029
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:29,780
The other...

2030
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:31,860
It's super massive, right?

2031
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:33,720
There's the other one that's...

2032
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:35,400
God damn!

2033
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:42,100
It's like a space one, I think it is.

2034
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:43,600
Oh.

2035
01:34:49,530 --> 01:34:50,950
Please no spamming!

2036
01:34:51,210 --> 01:34:52,350
Please no spamming!

2037
01:34:57,340 --> 01:34:58,820
Yeah, it's like a...

2038
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:02,480
It feels like...

2039
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:03,780
It feels like The Thing.

2040
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:05,220
You know?

2041
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:06,100
Like the movie?

2042
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:10,620
Like, it seems like The Thing kind of plot.

2043
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:12,820
But you're in space, and...

2044
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:23,960
Callisto Protocol!

2045
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:25,020
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

2046
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:25,900
That's the one, that's the one.

2047
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:28,300
Oh my God!

2048
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:30,820
Please.

2049
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:35,020
This is so bad.

2050
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:35,980
At least give me a free ball!

2051
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:36,540
Just...

2052
01:35:44,170 --> 01:35:45,290
Oh, come on!

2053
01:35:45,670 --> 01:35:46,710
I hate this game!

2054
01:35:46,850 --> 01:35:47,650
I hate this game!

2055
01:35:47,790 --> 01:35:48,730
I hate this challenge!

2056
01:35:49,050 --> 01:35:49,950
I hate this game!

2057
01:35:49,970 --> 01:35:50,690
I hate this challenge!

2058
01:35:51,450 --> 01:35:51,890
No!

2059
01:35:59,070 --> 01:36:00,610
Let's just do it.

2060
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:01,590
We'll go back to that one.

2061
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:04,610
This level has 45 pegs.

2062
01:36:04,610 --> 01:36:05,810
And then this one's 350.

2063
01:36:06,070 --> 01:36:08,150
We got 350...

2064
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:09,790
No, we didn't get 350,000.

2065
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:11,030
But we could try.

2066
01:36:11,030 --> 01:36:11,370
But we could try.

2067
01:36:12,010 --> 01:36:12,970
Alright, guys.

2068
01:36:13,570 --> 01:36:14,930
We need big money.

2069
01:36:18,850 --> 01:36:19,490
Wow!

2070
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:20,970
Nice!

2071
01:36:21,030 --> 01:36:26,430
Oh my God!

2072
01:36:26,930 --> 01:36:28,570
Oh my God!

2073
01:36:28,990 --> 01:36:30,370
Oh my God!

2074
01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:31,830
I'm here for that.

2075
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:32,550
I hate this game.

2076
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:36,730
I'm here for that.

2077
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:36,730
I hate this game.

2078
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:37,730
Same studio as Dead Space.

2079
01:36:37,730 --> 01:36:38,610
Callisto Prodigal?

2080
01:36:39,090 --> 01:36:40,810
Wait, maybe I'm thinking of a different game then.

2081
01:36:41,150 --> 01:36:43,350
No, it's definitely the Until the Dawn people.

2082
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:47,650
It's definitely the Until Dawn people.

2083
01:36:49,450 --> 01:36:50,230
Oh my God, no.

2084
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:05,460
Hold on, I'm gonna look it up.

2085
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:06,380
Now it's gonna bother me.

2086
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:08,920
Because I don't think it's out yet either.

2087
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:11,280
Um...

2088
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:19,910
Until the Dawn in Space.

2089
01:37:20,690 --> 01:37:21,650
Until the Dawn in Space.

2090
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:22,050
Until the Dawn in Space.

2091
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:25,970
The Dark Pictures Anthology.

2092
01:37:26,770 --> 01:37:26,830
The Dark Pictures Anthology.

2093
01:37:27,810 --> 01:37:28,950
What is it called?

2094
01:37:30,290 --> 01:37:30,770
What?

2095
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:32,790
Come

2096
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:43,210
on!

2097
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:43,890
I got this!

2098
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:45,430
I got this!

2099
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:48,990
Directive 8020.

2100
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:50,810
Oh, you guys were all saying it in the chat.

2101
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:53,930
Oh, you guys were all saying it in the chat.

2102
01:37:54,630 --> 01:37:55,070
Directive...

2103
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:57,790
Directive...

2104
01:37:57,790 --> 01:37:58,570
80...

2105
01:37:59,890 --> 01:38:00,970
Yeah, that one.

2106
01:38:02,050 --> 01:38:03,110
Yeah, that one.

2107
01:38:06,410 --> 01:38:07,510
Oh my God, go to purple.

2108
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:08,950
Free ball?

2109
01:38:09,170 --> 01:38:09,590
No!

2110
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:16,320
Look how many points we're already at though.

2111
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:16,860
That's kind of insane.

2112
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:19,080
Oh my gosh!

2113
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:19,940
Free ball!

2114
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:25,960
Guys?

2115
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:26,280
Guys?

2116
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:29,480
First I've heard of that game.

2117
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:30,480
It's not out yet.

2118
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:35,220
I think they just kind of talked about it.

2119
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:38,380
First...

2120
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:43,100
Oh, here we go.

2121
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:48,060
Dang it.

2122
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,300
Can we get to the purple up there?

2123
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:53,720
Wouldn't that be insane?

2124
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:56,560
Like that!

2125
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,360
Oh no, we didn't make it!

2126
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:05,500
Oh no, we didn't make it!

2127
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:06,300
Wait.

2128
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:07,840
Okay.

2129
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:08,680
Come on.

2130
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:10,800
100,000, baby.

2131
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:12,260
100,000.

2132
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:13,600
100,000.

2133
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:35,800
Even though I'm sad about my dessert not being finished, my bacon-wrapped jalapeno pepper jack stuffed chicken breast turns out good.

2134
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:37,760
Gosh, Kinky, you need to just open a restaurant.

2135
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:38,800
Cleverly done.

2136
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:39,620
Cleverly done.

2137
01:39:39,620 --> 01:39:39,620
Cleverly done.

2138
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:40,240
Cleverly done.

2139
01:39:41,780 --> 01:39:42,460
Done!

2140
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:46,240
Okay.

2141
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:48,920
45 gold pegs.

2142
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:49,420
Let's try it.

2143
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:51,580
45?

2144
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:54,400
This is insane.

2145
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:57,160
We've busted over 300k.

2146
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:58,040
Yeah, baby!

2147
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:59,020
Yeah, we are!

2148
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:02,740
Free ball!

2149
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:04,400
Why didn't you disappear?

2150
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:06,060
Why didn't you disappear?

2151
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:06,620
Yo!

2152
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:12,140
Oh my god.

2153
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:14,500
It just literally went circled around it.

2154
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:15,380
You asshole.

2155
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:21,020
Come on.

2156
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:22,280
Ah!

2157
01:40:23,380 --> 01:40:23,920
Ah!

2158
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:27,020
Man.

2159
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:29,300
Man.

2160
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:30,720
Man, man.

2161
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:35,020
So happy to be playing this with you guys tonight.

2162
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:37,300
Thanks for being here.

2163
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,240
I really appreciate it.

2164
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:40,400
Thanks guys for watching me.

2165
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:41,540
Hehe.

2166
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:47,720
Nice.

2167
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:50,080
Oh, that one will break.

2168
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:50,660
Yeah, okay.

2169
01:40:56,980 --> 01:40:57,500
Hehe.

2170
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:01,860
Bink-bonk!

2171
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:02,600
Bink-bonk!

2172
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:02,900
Yeah!

2173
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:03,960
That's bink-bonk!

2174
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:06,180
We only have four left though.

2175
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:07,100
Quite a bit.

2176
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:07,980
Quite a few.

2177
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:09,320
Wait, this will be a long shot.

2178
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:12,520
Maybe we'll get lucky.

2179
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:13,720
No.

2180
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:18,600
Three balls left and quite a bit to go.

2181
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:20,940
Oh gosh.

2182
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:24,860
For ones like that, I really need to like...

2183
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:27,860
wait for it to maybe...

2184
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:30,220
be underneath.

2185
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:32,720
Last ball.

2186
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:34,460
We got pretty close though.

2187
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,600
Your emails are the best.

2188
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:37,880
Oh, I'm glad you think so.

2189
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:39,120
I'm glad you like them.

2190
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:39,800
Thank you.

2191
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:43,340
Oh no!

2192
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:44,920
Oh no!

2193
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:48,300
I'm not watching you.

2194
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:49,840
I'm just here for the cool frogs on the stream.

2195
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:51,760
Honestly?

2196
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:54,280
I get it.

2197
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:56,780
I get it.

2198
01:41:56,780 --> 01:41:57,140
I get it.

2199
01:41:57,140 --> 01:41:57,560
I get it.

2200
01:41:59,120 --> 01:41:59,800
I get it.

2201
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:00,260
I get it.

2202
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:00,740
I get it.

2203
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:04,080
I get it.

2204
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:07,720
You're here for heavy.

2205
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:21,220
What about me?

2206
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:30,260
Nice.

2207
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:35,340
Get in there.

2208
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:35,840
Get in there.

2209
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:37,340
Get in there.

2210
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:38,800
Peckle, peckle, peckle, peckle, peckle!

2211
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,860
I love playing blackjack!

2212
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:43,560
Oh my god!

2213
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:44,560
Oh my god!

2214
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:50,660
Frog... what?

2215
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:51,220
What is frog?

2216
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:54,260
Frog fractions.

2217
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:55,320
No, I've never played that.

2218
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:55,700
What is that?

2219
01:43:01,580 --> 01:43:02,060
Hopefully...

2220
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:08,320
I was gonna say, hopefully it goes further than what it looks to do, but...

2221
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,600
Oh come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!

2222
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:12,560
Can you move over?

2223
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:13,600
You're blocking my ocean.

2224
01:43:30,290 --> 01:43:32,030
Frog factions is a spooky indie game.

2225
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:32,450
Oh really?

2226
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:37,850
I saw a lot of people playing Zoo-co-sis recently.

2227
01:43:38,150 --> 01:43:42,990
No one's asked me to play it, but I'm just gonna say I won't ever play it.

2228
01:43:43,190 --> 01:43:44,810
I can't play games like that.

2229
01:43:45,150 --> 01:43:48,210
That like, involve sick animals.

2230
01:43:48,370 --> 01:43:50,730
I will just cry the entire time.

2231
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:51,710
I'll be so sad.

2232
01:43:53,770 --> 01:43:54,990
I'll never play it.

2233
01:43:55,050 --> 01:43:55,690
I'm really sorry.

2234
01:43:56,710 --> 01:43:58,410
I don't even know if it's any good or not.

2235
01:43:59,590 --> 01:44:01,590
But I can't actually play it.

2236
01:44:02,470 --> 01:44:05,170
I will literally just be...

2237
01:44:06,170 --> 01:44:06,870
Sad girl.

2238
01:44:12,390 --> 01:44:15,610
Guys, wait, we have three balls left.

2239
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:18,190
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

2240
01:44:21,510 --> 01:44:26,210
Guys, I think we've done it!

2241
01:44:42,030 --> 01:44:43,410
Oh, that was me saying it.

2242
01:44:43,690 --> 01:44:44,810
You did well!

2243
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:48,470
Oh, my bad.

2244
01:44:48,570 --> 01:44:49,430
Oh, wait, hold on.

2245
01:44:49,510 --> 01:44:51,170
I'm gonna move myself back over.

2246
01:44:55,570 --> 01:44:56,130
Alright.

2247
01:44:57,930 --> 01:45:01,810
One final challenge, guys.

2248
01:45:01,930 --> 01:45:05,450
Zoo-co-sis has some wildly realistic animal distress noises that makes...

2249
01:45:05,450 --> 01:45:08,370
That it makes me more uncomfortable than the horror stuff.

2250
01:45:08,650 --> 01:45:10,010
Oh, yeah, see, I...

2251
01:45:10,650 --> 01:45:11,630
Oh, no, no, no.

2252
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:14,670
That sounds way too specific of mechanics to be enjoyable then.

2253
01:45:14,990 --> 01:45:15,910
Oh, well, good.

2254
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:16,950
Then I won't...

2255
01:45:16,950 --> 01:45:18,030
I'm not gonna play it.

2256
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:26,820
Let her rip!

2257
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:29,500
Trust my instincts.

2258
01:45:30,220 --> 01:45:30,620
Oh.

2259
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:32,500
Wait, I'm not...

2260
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:33,020
Hold on.

2261
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:34,560
Pause.

2262
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:36,320
There we go.

2263
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:37,540
My bad.

2264
01:45:39,940 --> 01:45:44,180
I saw they're making a new Alien Isolation.

2265
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:44,880
That's exciting.

2266
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:48,500
A game that scares me too much.

2267
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:52,020
That's a game that scares me a lot.

2268
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:04,820
Oh, yeah, I've not played the first one.

2269
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:06,780
Scary.

2270
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:10,200
But I like Alien movies.

2271
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:12,720
I've watched the Let's Play of it.

2272
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:13,700
I remember...

2273
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:21,840
Gosh, do you guys remember when that game first came out and everyone was just like, Boo, this game is way too slow.

2274
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:23,340
Where's the alien?

2275
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:24,180
Where...

2276
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:26,740
And now everyone is like obsessed with it.

2277
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:27,200
What happened?

2278
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,300
Now they're making a new one and everyone's just like, Yeah!

2279
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:36,400
Everyone was just like, Oh, my God.

2280
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:39,120
Alien just doesn't show up enough.

2281
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:39,680
Not scary.

2282
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:41,460
Two out of ten.

2283
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:48,840
The game grew on people.

2284
01:46:49,180 --> 01:46:49,600
Oh, yeah.

2285
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:50,260
Oh, my gosh.

2286
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:51,040
I only have three balls.

2287
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:52,940
No!

2288
01:46:53,860 --> 01:46:55,280
This one is so hard.

2289
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:56,340
I know I'm probably...

2290
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:58,240
I'm also just like shooting willy-nilly.

2291
01:46:58,320 --> 01:46:59,880
I'm not really thinking right now.

2292
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:00,420
I

2293
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:23,860
don't know what the stride is here.

2294
01:47:24,100 --> 01:47:25,540
I'm just going to shoot into the corner.

2295
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:27,040
Hope for the best.

2296
01:47:28,620 --> 01:47:29,040
Oh, fuck.

2297
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:31,000
Anyway.

2298
01:47:43,580 --> 01:47:44,840
Shoot to the corner.

2299
01:47:47,140 --> 01:47:49,260
Yeah, I get these little corner bits, you know.

2300
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:52,600
I'm a peg-goal master, you guys.

2301
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:55,080
I've mastered the peg.

2302
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:58,960
I can get this final challenge.

2303
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:00,900
I can do it.

2304
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:03,960
I am Mint Phantom.

2305
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:13,640
No.

2306
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,280
Nice.

2307
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:25,740
Nice.

2308
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:28,080
Please, free ball.

2309
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:29,760
Free ball.

2310
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:32,080
Yes.

2311
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:34,100
Double.

2312
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:35,340
Yeah.

2313
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:39,640
The M&M stands for...

2314
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:40,100
No.

2315
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:41,880
Not Master Peg or Master Peg-ler.

2316
01:48:46,980 --> 01:48:48,220
We're in good shape here, guys.

2317
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:51,220
Oh, my God.

2318
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:52,520
Oh, my God.

2319
01:48:52,580 --> 01:48:53,060
Oh, my God.

2320
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:57,360
Imagine if I said we're in good shape here, guys.

2321
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:57,860
I missed.

2322
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:00,040
Holy cow.

2323
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:07,740
Dang it.

2324
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:10,660
Ruined my shot.

2325
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:10,840
Oh, my God.

2326
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:13,280
Oh, my God.

2327
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:13,680
That was in luck.

2328
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:15,400
That was pure skill.

2329
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:16,820
Baby.

2330
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:17,880
Nice.

2331
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:19,480
Oh, my God.

2332
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:31,320
The

2333
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:41,420
L is silent.

2334
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:42,740
No, it's not.

2335
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:47,540
No,

2336
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:54,080
it's...

2337
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:56,560
Oh, my God.

2338
01:49:57,620 --> 01:49:58,760
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

2339
01:49:58,900 --> 01:49:59,140
Oh, my God.

2340
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:00,440
Two balls left, you guys.

2341
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:08,580
Oh

2342
01:50:13,310 --> 01:50:14,150
my god.

2343
01:50:14,370 --> 01:50:15,250
Is this it?

2344
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:16,670
Is this the final one?

2345
01:50:17,030 --> 01:50:18,250
Is this it?

2346
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:28,420
I would like to dedicate this to dancing froggies in the corner.

2347
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:30,740
This one's for you!

2348
01:50:30,740 --> 01:50:30,840
You!

2349
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,000
Ultra extreme!

2350
01:50:47,650 --> 01:50:49,140
And we still get in the corner.

2351
01:51:02,180 --> 01:51:02,840
Congratulations!

2352
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,040
Incredible.

2353
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:04,900
Amazing.

2354
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:06,440
You defeated them utterly.

2355
01:51:06,700 --> 01:51:15,350
Now you're ready to get the full version of Bagel and Master.

2356
01:51:15,490 --> 01:51:17,570
I already own the full version of Bagel.

2357
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:29,340
Oh my god.

2358
01:51:32,420 --> 01:51:34,840
This is just a big ol' ad.

2359
01:51:51,990 --> 01:51:54,050
I beat the demo.

2360
01:51:54,210 --> 01:51:56,030
I am so awesome.

2361
01:51:56,970 --> 01:51:59,470
Now I need to get the full version.

2362
01:52:00,490 --> 01:52:02,490
Donating for the full version of Bagel.

2363
01:52:02,610 --> 01:52:03,670
I already...

2364
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:07,150
I've already beat the full version of Bagel.

2365
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:08,510
Wait, can we duel?

2366
01:52:09,510 --> 01:52:11,110
Fight off against a friend?

2367
01:52:11,910 --> 01:52:14,190
Hey, who wants to be my friend?

2368
01:52:16,530 --> 01:52:17,850
Let's do Toasty.

2369
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:19,670
Where...

2370
01:52:19,670 --> 01:52:21,790
Who the hell is Jimmy Lightning?

2371
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:23,610
Huh?

2372
01:52:26,910 --> 01:52:27,770
Wait, who...

2373
01:52:27,770 --> 01:52:28,550
Oh.

2374
01:52:28,650 --> 01:52:29,730
Play with a friend.

2375
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:37,830
What?

2376
01:52:38,050 --> 01:52:39,290
I can't even...

2377
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:40,990
I can't even put his...

2378
01:52:40,990 --> 01:52:42,590
You gave him that name.

2379
01:52:42,670 --> 01:52:43,810
I can't even put it in there.

2380
01:52:48,540 --> 01:52:49,660
Jimmy Lighten.

2381
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:53,680
Never seen a more professional pegler in my life.

2382
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:54,400
Thank you.

2383
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:56,260
Johnny Sasaki.

2384
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:02,120
Why won't it let me put in the K?

2385
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:03,640
What?

2386
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:05,680
Sasaki...

2387
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:06,860
It only lets me...

2388
01:53:06,860 --> 01:53:08,500
Wait, is my K key broken?

2389
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:09,840
No?

2390
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:14,260
Johnny...

2391
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:15,820
Sa...

2392
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:17,060
Sa...

2393
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:18,780
Sasai.

2394
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:21,900
Johnny Acai Bowl.

2395
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:24,240
Johnny...

2396
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:25,320
Acai.

2397
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:30,640
Okay...

2398
01:53:33,660 --> 01:53:34,680
Mintos turn...

2399
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:35,900
Wait, oh...

2400
01:53:36,460 --> 01:53:38,100
Oh, I thought it was going to be online.

2401
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:42,020
Um...

2402
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:46,020
I was going to invite you guys to play.

2403
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,260
Um...

2404
01:53:53,790 --> 01:53:55,290
I'll shoot for you, okay?

2405
01:53:55,710 --> 01:53:56,990
This is Minto's turn.

2406
01:53:59,650 --> 01:54:00,970
This is Minto's turn.

2407
01:54:03,950 --> 01:54:04,670
Your turn.

2408
01:54:09,990 --> 01:54:11,030
Oh, you got one.

2409
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:11,850
You got an orange.

2410
01:54:12,010 --> 01:54:12,430
Good job.

2411
01:54:14,290 --> 01:54:15,430
Okay, Minto's turn.

2412
01:54:24,910 --> 01:54:25,750
Nice.

2413
01:54:26,050 --> 01:54:27,550
Yeah, good, good.

2414
01:54:28,610 --> 01:54:29,770
Your turn!

2415
01:54:32,430 --> 01:54:34,250
Awww, Johnny!

2416
01:54:36,570 --> 01:54:37,410
Johnny!

2417
01:54:37,590 --> 01:54:38,290
Johnny!

2418
01:54:40,910 --> 01:54:42,650
Johnny, what are you doing?

2419
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:47,850
Johnny!

2420
01:54:49,250 --> 01:54:50,910
Get your head in the game, come on!

2421
01:54:51,490 --> 01:54:53,030
Oh my gosh, I almost had an extra ball.

2422
01:54:55,630 --> 01:54:56,290
Johnny's turn.

2423
01:54:59,650 --> 01:55:00,070
Johnny!

2424
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:04,990
You're gonna get penalized.

2425
01:55:04,990 --> 01:55:06,510
You're gonna keep getting penalized.

2426
01:55:08,490 --> 01:55:09,130
Johnny's turn.

2427
01:55:12,710 --> 01:55:14,410
Sounds so aggressive.

2428
01:55:17,010 --> 01:55:19,070
It's such an aggressive like...

2429
01:55:20,710 --> 01:55:22,890
It's like watching a person play chess alone.

2430
01:55:28,610 --> 01:55:30,030
Minto's last ball!

2431
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:31,450
Just kidding!

2432
01:55:32,610 --> 01:55:34,070
Oh, Johnny's turn.

2433
01:55:38,210 --> 01:55:38,990
Minto!

2434
01:55:38,990 --> 01:55:41,000
You guys got 420!

2435
01:55:44,210 --> 01:55:44,730
Go

2436
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:49,780
away!

2437
01:55:51,740 --> 01:55:54,840
And I got 42160!

2438
01:56:06,290 --> 01:56:08,150
Alright, frogs, get off the screen.

2439
01:56:08,650 --> 01:56:10,250
Get off the screen, frogs!

2440
01:56:10,370 --> 01:56:11,370
Get off the screen!

2441
01:56:11,650 --> 01:56:12,290
Goodbye, goodbye.

2442
01:56:13,830 --> 01:56:15,270
Goodbye, frogs, goodbye.

2443
01:56:16,610 --> 01:56:17,130
Um...

2444
01:56:21,940 --> 01:56:24,000
This is like the crispiest...

2445
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,200
If you guys want some crispy, crunchy ASMR...

2446
01:56:27,740 --> 01:56:28,920
This is it!

2447
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:29,980
This is it!

2448
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,560
This is the crispiest, crunchiest ASMR.

2449
01:56:32,980 --> 01:56:34,220
We let you win, you're welcome.

2450
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:35,220
Thank you!

2451
01:56:42,350 --> 01:56:42,910
Crunchy.

2452
01:56:45,050 --> 01:56:46,370
It's so crunchy.

2453
01:56:47,370 --> 01:56:50,550
A master pegler like you should definitely check out Peglin.

2454
01:56:51,310 --> 01:56:53,930
I do know Peglin.

2455
01:56:54,070 --> 01:56:55,230
Now that I think about it.

2456
01:56:55,390 --> 01:56:59,170
I remember being told about Peglin before.

2457
01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:01,610
I think I looked it up.

2458
01:57:02,630 --> 01:57:03,150
Yield!

2459
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:04,310
Thank you for the five gifted.

2460
01:57:04,490 --> 01:57:05,190
Thank you!

2461
01:57:06,770 --> 01:57:07,910
What happened to Bjorn?

2462
01:57:08,030 --> 01:57:09,250
Don't worry about it.

2463
01:57:09,330 --> 01:57:12,590
In fact, I am going to make that shut up though.

2464
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:16,090
I'm not going to talk for too long because...

2465
01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:17,750
Sorry.

2466
01:57:18,790 --> 01:57:19,870
Shorter stream today.

2467
01:57:20,010 --> 01:57:21,070
Because I...

2468
01:57:21,670 --> 01:57:22,190
Um...

2469
01:57:22,190 --> 01:57:24,810
I am...

2470
01:57:24,810 --> 01:57:25,850
You know...

2471
01:57:25,850 --> 01:57:29,550
Letting my voice recover a little bit.

2472
01:57:29,630 --> 01:57:30,390
Give me a second.

2473
01:57:31,610 --> 01:57:32,510
What do we want to listen to?

2474
01:57:34,750 --> 01:57:35,810
What do we want to listen to?

2475
01:57:35,910 --> 01:57:36,230
This one?

2476
01:57:36,390 --> 01:57:36,910
What's this one?

2477
01:57:44,140 --> 01:57:44,880
This one is chill.

2478
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:49,480
Give me one second.

2479
01:57:54,450 --> 01:57:55,130
Where am I?

2480
01:57:56,050 --> 01:57:56,410
Oh!

2481
01:57:56,510 --> 01:57:57,190
Wait a second.

2482
01:57:57,250 --> 01:57:57,970
I got to fix something.

2483
01:58:00,950 --> 01:58:02,050
I got to fix it.

2484
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:04,570
There I am!

2485
01:58:10,370 --> 01:58:11,670
There I am!

2486
01:58:12,850 --> 01:58:13,970
Invisible ghost.

2487
01:58:18,170 --> 01:58:19,790
What happened to me?

2488
01:58:19,950 --> 01:58:20,470
Why?

2489
01:58:20,970 --> 01:58:22,570
Why did I freeze?

2490
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:27,290
I'm back.

2491
01:58:28,930 --> 01:58:29,610
Boneless ghost.

2492
01:58:33,170 --> 01:58:34,110
You guys.

2493
01:58:34,110 --> 01:58:35,470
3.0.

2494
01:58:35,710 --> 01:58:36,450
Coming up.

2495
01:58:36,650 --> 01:58:37,530
Big stuff.

2496
01:58:37,790 --> 01:58:38,510
Big news.

2497
01:58:40,010 --> 01:58:41,210
Actually I paid...

2498
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:44,010
A lot of people I needed to pay.

2499
01:58:44,450 --> 01:58:44,970
Today.

2500
01:58:46,690 --> 01:58:49,030
I paid a lot of people I needed to pay today.

2501
01:58:51,090 --> 01:58:51,610
So...

2502
01:58:52,790 --> 01:58:53,310
Um...

2503
01:58:53,310 --> 01:58:54,110
Wait a second.

2504
01:58:54,890 --> 01:58:55,850
Something is wrong.

2505
01:58:56,250 --> 01:58:57,130
Give me a second.

2506
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,280
There we go.

2507
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:05,140
Oh, I think that happened.

2508
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:06,420
Um...

2509
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:09,160
Yeah.

2510
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:09,580
Oh!

2511
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:10,280
Empty wallet!

2512
01:59:10,540 --> 01:59:10,720
Yeah!

2513
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:12,900
No, I was only...

2514
01:59:12,900 --> 01:59:16,080
I've only been able to get all the stuff that I've been getting.

2515
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:17,100
Um...

2516
01:59:17,100 --> 01:59:18,680
Because of you guys help.

2517
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:20,540
Hopefully...

2518
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:23,140
It's basically like new...

2519
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:24,380
Everything.

2520
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:25,800
Like new...

2521
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:27,240
New music.

2522
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:28,360
New intro.

2523
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:30,760
Um...

2524
01:59:31,660 --> 01:59:32,340
What else?

2525
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:34,540
Minto project tags.

2526
01:59:34,740 --> 01:59:35,660
Thank you Turtles!

2527
01:59:35,660 --> 01:59:36,380
Thank you!

2528
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:38,820
And another secret thing that...

2529
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:41,140
Will be released on that day.

2530
01:59:43,180 --> 01:59:44,040
Yeah, yeah.

2531
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:45,800
So...

2532
01:59:47,220 --> 01:59:48,160
New background.

2533
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:48,720
Actually...

2534
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:50,740
I think this is the only thing that will remain the same.

2535
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:55,820
Will we see Mintos in 3.0?

2536
01:59:56,280 --> 01:59:56,880
Uh...

2537
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:57,920
Maybe.

2538
01:59:59,420 --> 02:00:00,020
Maybe.

2539
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:01,940
Try Princess Thank You!

2540
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:06,240
Yeah, so...

2541
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:07,440
Hmm...

2542
02:00:10,430 --> 02:00:11,390
The background...

2543
02:00:11,390 --> 02:00:12,970
I guess the background is kind of new.

2544
02:00:13,030 --> 02:00:15,310
It's newer than my old background, right?

2545
02:00:15,730 --> 02:00:17,130
You heard her guys pay up.

2546
02:00:17,250 --> 02:00:17,390
No!

2547
02:00:17,630 --> 02:00:18,530
No, no, no.

2548
02:00:19,230 --> 02:00:20,090
Save for you.

2549
02:00:20,470 --> 02:00:21,350
Thank you!

2550
02:00:22,690 --> 02:00:24,230
Thank you Flowerworks!

2551
02:00:24,290 --> 02:00:25,350
Thank you for 4 months!

2552
02:00:26,330 --> 02:00:28,050
Will we lose bouncy Chibi Minto?

2553
02:00:28,130 --> 02:00:28,710
No, no.

2554
02:00:28,770 --> 02:00:31,370
Actually, I might even ask them to update...

2555
02:00:31,370 --> 02:00:33,650
Chibi Minto to be...

2556
02:00:33,650 --> 02:00:34,330
Uh...

2557
02:00:35,930 --> 02:00:36,430
To...

2558
02:00:37,890 --> 02:00:39,090
To new Minto.

2559
02:00:39,250 --> 02:00:40,770
Since there's a few little bit of changes.

2560
02:00:41,110 --> 02:00:42,030
Like with the outfit.

2561
02:00:43,830 --> 02:00:44,930
And other stuff.

2562
02:00:47,210 --> 02:00:47,710
Yeah.

2563
02:00:48,110 --> 02:00:51,890
Did you hear that Hideaki Anno is making a space battleship Yamato movie?

2564
02:00:51,970 --> 02:00:52,470
No way!

2565
02:00:52,610 --> 02:00:52,890
Really?

2566
02:00:57,070 --> 02:00:58,630
But yeah, Chibi Minto will stay.

2567
02:01:00,170 --> 02:01:00,670
Um...

2568
02:01:06,580 --> 02:01:07,080
But...

2569
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:08,600
You know, my...

2570
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:09,600
It's my...

2571
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:10,960
Full...

2572
02:01:12,280 --> 02:01:14,460
Apparition that will...

2573
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:16,080
Kind of cease.

2574
02:01:16,420 --> 02:01:17,480
But not cease.

2575
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:18,460
It will transform.

2576
02:01:19,020 --> 02:01:20,560
To a different form.

2577
02:01:21,780 --> 02:01:23,400
It will become...

2578
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:24,620
Evolved.

2579
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:25,540
It's like...

2580
02:01:25,540 --> 02:01:26,540
I'm like a Pokemon.

2581
02:01:27,420 --> 02:01:28,960
Except I become the same.

2582
02:01:29,300 --> 02:01:30,420
But a little different.

2583
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:37,180
A Mighty Morphin Minto Ranger.

2584
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:37,760
Yeah, yeah.

2585
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:41,880
So...

2586
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:42,700
She's gonna be dead.

2587
02:01:43,180 --> 02:01:44,080
I mean...

2588
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:46,200
I am dead.

2589
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:46,740
Oh, sorry.

2590
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:48,840
Sudden crunchy jumpscare.

2591
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:49,900
I'm exiting out of the game.

2592
02:01:50,620 --> 02:01:52,620
Today's my birthday, Gerard!

2593
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:54,120
Happy birthday!

2594
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:58,400
Happy birthday to you!

2595
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:00,400
Happy birthday to you!

2596
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:01,300
Happy birthday to you!

2597
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:04,620
Happy birthday, Dear Gerard.

2598
02:02:06,340 --> 02:02:08,020
Happy birthday!

2599
02:02:09,260 --> 02:02:10,280
To you.

2600
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:13,820
Whoouu Happy birthday!

2601
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:18,020
I really just wanted...

2602
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:19,140
I don't know.

2603
02:02:19,180 --> 02:02:20,060
Not like a restart.

2604
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:20,760
But just...

2605
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:25,140
I wanted to feel...

2606
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:29,000
I wanted to feel...

2607
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:33,140
New, but kind of the same.

2608
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:35,020
I mean, it's going to be a lot of new stuff.

2609
02:02:36,900 --> 02:02:40,100
I guess I wanted it for... it's really, I think, mainly, mostly for myself.

2610
02:02:41,740 --> 02:02:43,260
To feel kind of...

2611
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:48,020
Because, you know, when I came back, I had everything the same.

2612
02:02:49,860 --> 02:02:52,200
As when I first left, so...

2613
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:53,820
It's...

2614
02:02:54,640 --> 02:02:57,340
It almost feels like I never...

2615
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:00,780
Like, I, you know...

2616
02:03:00,780 --> 02:03:02,940
And I wasn't sure how long I'd stick around.

2617
02:03:05,100 --> 02:03:05,460
But...

2618
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:07,800
It's...

2619
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:10,400
So, I didn't get anything new, you know?

2620
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:11,900
I just kind of was like, okay, I'll come back.

2621
02:03:14,580 --> 02:03:17,440
So, I wanted to feel a little bit more official, I suppose.

2622
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:20,480
I guess the best way to put it.

2623
02:03:24,900 --> 02:03:26,140
So, official comeback!

2624
02:03:26,140 --> 02:03:30,220
After, like, eight months of being here.

2625
02:03:32,540 --> 02:03:33,720
Or seven months?

2626
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:38,900
Wait, I came back April, May, June, July, August, September, October.

2627
02:03:39,200 --> 02:03:39,740
Seven months!

2628
02:03:39,820 --> 02:03:40,620
Well, it's the end of October.

2629
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:41,640
Almost eight months.

2630
02:03:42,160 --> 02:03:42,840
Treat yourself.

2631
02:03:43,060 --> 02:03:43,760
This is a threat.

2632
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:44,300
No!

2633
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:47,840
I'm just going to put it back towards...

2634
02:03:49,460 --> 02:03:50,960
I'm going to put it back towards the debut!

2635
02:03:53,020 --> 02:03:54,340
I'll say it until I'm blue in the face.

2636
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:55,540
Glad you're still with us, babe.

2637
02:03:55,700 --> 02:03:56,120
Thank you!

2638
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:56,300
Thank you!

2639
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:03,300
Jack's back, baby!

2640
02:04:06,260 --> 02:04:08,060
She's counting on her fingers right now.

2641
02:04:16,690 --> 02:04:17,810
How'd you know that?

2642
02:04:25,530 --> 02:04:26,710
Don't call me...

2643
02:04:31,190 --> 02:04:32,830
Don't call me out for that.

2644
02:04:33,610 --> 02:04:35,950
I'll say it until I'm boneless!

2645
02:04:44,030 --> 02:04:45,890
What did she mean by that?

2646
02:04:48,370 --> 02:04:51,670
One of life's and afterlife's big mysteries.

2647
02:04:52,210 --> 02:04:55,510
Thank you for officially telling us after seven months that you're officially staying...

2648
02:04:58,450 --> 02:05:01,510
You couldn't tell from a new debut?

2649
02:05:01,830 --> 02:05:02,950
You couldn't tell!

2650
02:05:05,310 --> 02:05:06,550
Why would I debut?

2651
02:05:10,070 --> 02:05:10,630
If...

2652
02:05:11,450 --> 02:05:12,010
If...

2653
02:05:12,010 --> 02:05:12,710
If...

2654
02:05:12,710 --> 02:05:14,710
If I was going to leave!

2655
02:05:19,420 --> 02:05:22,000
Last time you debuted a new model, you graduated.

2656
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:23,100
But...

2657
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:24,420
That was...

2658
02:05:25,460 --> 02:05:26,240
Different.

2659
02:05:27,090 --> 02:05:27,480
I...

2660
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:29,540
Made a new model...

2661
02:05:29,970 --> 02:05:31,480
And then...

2662
02:05:32,010 --> 02:05:32,400
Uh...

2663
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:34,000
Heaven called forth.

2664
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:36,540
I made...

2665
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:37,760
I started a new model!

2666
02:05:37,860 --> 02:05:40,520
I started 2.0 before...

2667
02:05:41,220 --> 02:05:42,260
Before I...

2668
02:05:42,260 --> 02:05:43,960
Before Heaven called for me!

2669
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:48,320
Otherwise I never would have made it!

2670
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:49,340
Oh my gosh.

2671
02:05:49,400 --> 02:05:50,280
Keio, thank you!

2672
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:53,200
Paying my dues for being a long time clip watcher.

2673
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:53,920
Give up the good work.

2674
02:05:54,060 --> 02:05:54,320
Awww!

2675
02:05:54,780 --> 02:05:55,680
Thank you!

2676
02:05:55,820 --> 02:05:57,000
Thanks for dropping by!

2677
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:58,240
Thank you so much for the akasupa!

2678
02:05:58,580 --> 02:06:00,240
Thank you so so so much!

2679
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,240
I saw the light and then...

2680
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:07,300
I dropped back down.

2681
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:12,340
I saw the light and then...

2682
02:06:12,340 --> 02:06:13,480
I was like...

2683
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:13,960
Oh, Heaven?

2684
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:16,640
I belong in Hell!

2685
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:27,520
She hates us real.

2686
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:28,460
She hates us REAL!

2687
02:06:31,340 --> 02:06:31,840
We...

2688
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:33,860
Go and be sad if you leave, champ.

2689
02:06:34,140 --> 02:06:34,600
No!

2690
02:06:37,930 --> 02:06:38,670
I'm here.

2691
02:06:39,910 --> 02:06:41,430
This is our outer Heaven.

2692
02:06:41,590 --> 02:06:41,950
Literally.

2693
02:06:43,630 --> 02:06:45,790
Literally, I'm in outer Heaven right now.

2694
02:06:50,030 --> 02:06:50,830
How...

2695
02:06:50,830 --> 02:06:53,030
How perfect for...

2696
02:06:53,030 --> 02:06:54,250
Specifically me.

2697
02:06:54,490 --> 02:06:54,890
Hahaha.

2698
02:06:57,010 --> 02:06:57,810
We're...

2699
02:06:57,810 --> 02:07:00,510
Where the Minto sans frontier are.

2700
02:07:01,690 --> 02:07:02,490
You're...

2701
02:07:02,490 --> 02:07:03,250
Assumed!

2702
02:07:03,430 --> 02:07:04,690
Oh thank you, David.

2703
02:07:04,690 --> 02:07:07,010
So is Grocer Minto officially out of the picture now?

2704
02:07:07,130 --> 02:07:08,410
I guess so.

2705
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:12,510
It still always makes me nervous though.

2706
02:07:14,830 --> 02:07:16,950
I'm extremely comfortable, you know?

2707
02:07:18,390 --> 02:07:19,310
Where I'm at.

2708
02:07:20,710 --> 02:07:24,010
I'm not saying like, oh, I need to be the biggest Vatobar.

2709
02:07:24,130 --> 02:07:25,010
I need to be bigger.

2710
02:07:25,270 --> 02:07:28,550
I love exactly where I'm at.

2711
02:07:29,710 --> 02:07:31,070
But, you know...

2712
02:07:32,150 --> 02:07:33,550
It always makes me worried.

2713
02:07:33,750 --> 02:07:36,670
What if one day my YouTube channel just gets kaput?

2714
02:07:36,890 --> 02:07:38,890
What if YouTube decides to be like...

2715
02:07:38,890 --> 02:07:42,870
You spied animals once too many times.

2716
02:07:43,050 --> 02:07:44,110
Which was one time.

2717
02:07:44,430 --> 02:07:45,970
And they decide to shut down my channel.

2718
02:07:46,710 --> 02:07:47,970
Then I have nothing.

2719
02:07:48,650 --> 02:07:50,490
And I'm like, oh god...

2720
02:07:50,490 --> 02:07:51,910
I'm out of a job.

2721
02:07:54,830 --> 02:07:57,050
Still never did that 250k stream.

2722
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:02,000
Oops.

2723
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:04,440
What should we do?

2724
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:06,020
For 250k.

2725
02:08:11,490 --> 02:08:12,730
There's a one block jump.

2726
02:08:12,730 --> 02:08:14,770
Will you be changing the Minto voice too?

2727
02:08:16,950 --> 02:08:19,610
Yeah, I'm gonna talk like this from now on.

2728
02:08:20,510 --> 02:08:22,230
It's like frog poop but tough.

2729
02:08:23,050 --> 02:08:24,110
That's what I'm gonna...

2730
02:08:24,910 --> 02:08:27,430
That's what I'm gonna talk and I'm gonna sound like.

2731
02:08:29,650 --> 02:08:31,050
It's the only voice I've got.

2732
02:08:36,430 --> 02:08:37,570
Oh, you're my inspiration.

2733
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:38,950
Thank you for staying with us Minto forever.

2734
02:08:39,150 --> 02:08:39,770
Thank you!

2735
02:08:41,710 --> 02:08:46,150
This is the same energy as everyone telling John Wick is back in the first movie and denying the rumors.

2736
02:08:46,610 --> 02:08:47,630
Wait, I don't know.

2737
02:08:47,650 --> 02:08:48,730
I don't understand this reference.

2738
02:08:49,950 --> 02:08:51,410
Glad to have you officially back Minto.

2739
02:08:51,550 --> 02:08:52,070
Thank you!

2740
02:08:53,810 --> 02:08:55,450
Debut a new outfit on April 1st.

2741
02:08:55,450 --> 02:08:56,030
Title it announcement.

2742
02:08:56,310 --> 02:08:58,890
How do you know I'm not gonna debut a new outfit on April 1st?

2743
02:09:01,950 --> 02:09:03,810
Mint goth maid model win.

2744
02:09:05,470 --> 02:09:07,130
Mint retirement fund tax.

2745
02:09:08,350 --> 02:09:09,910
You sound like my mom.

2746
02:09:10,470 --> 02:09:12,570
Okay, let's make a goth maid right now.

2747
02:09:13,290 --> 02:09:14,050
Okay, hold on.

2748
02:09:18,710 --> 02:09:19,290
Let's see.

2749
02:09:24,950 --> 02:09:27,110
Let's make a goth maid right now.

2750
02:09:27,530 --> 02:09:28,150
Let's see.

2751
02:09:28,690 --> 02:09:30,110
Okay, this.

2752
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:38,220
Wait, how can I make it this?

2753
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:38,680
Let's see.

2754
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:53,480
Build a goth Vtuber.

2755
02:09:55,260 --> 02:09:57,260
I can't keep the white stripes though.

2756
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:00,440
Wait, what is this deal?

2757
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:04,620
Oh, never mind.

2758
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:06,100
Never mind.

2759
02:10:06,240 --> 02:10:06,500
Okay.

2760
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:07,980
There's that.

2761
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:09,440
Let's see.

2762
02:10:11,380 --> 02:10:12,060
This part.

2763
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:20,480
Wait, that's the white ruffles.

2764
02:10:20,540 --> 02:10:21,480
We'll keep the white ruffles.

2765
02:10:29,220 --> 02:10:30,280
Oh, there we go.

2766
02:10:30,380 --> 02:10:30,560
There we go.

2767
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:36,780
Why is this so hard?

2768
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:38,840
Oh wait, you guys can't see anything.

2769
02:10:39,060 --> 02:10:39,540
Hold on.

2770
02:10:44,700 --> 02:10:45,300
There we go.

2771
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:48,240
It's this one, right?

2772
02:10:50,340 --> 02:10:51,220
No, that's the ruffles.

2773
02:10:55,640 --> 02:10:56,140
Let's see.

2774
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:59,620
If I just make it all black, it's hard to see.

2775
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:00,940
Actually, we'll just keep it like that.

2776
02:11:01,080 --> 02:11:02,740
Actually, it looks very traditional, doesn't it?

2777
02:11:04,220 --> 02:11:05,100
Looks so traditional.

2778
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:09,820
We'll make it a little bit more grayish.

2779
02:11:12,760 --> 02:11:13,620
And you...

2780
02:11:14,420 --> 02:11:15,900
Wait, what was the color that I did?

2781
02:11:16,660 --> 02:11:17,460
Something like that.

2782
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:18,920
Okay.

2783
02:11:18,920 --> 02:11:19,360
Okay.

2784
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:19,720
Okay.

2785
02:11:19,740 --> 02:11:20,000
Okay.

2786
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:23,400
And we gotta get the back.

2787
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:25,260
The back.

2788
02:11:28,060 --> 02:11:28,500
Um...

2789
02:11:29,540 --> 02:11:30,620
Wait, which part is it?

2790
02:11:31,380 --> 02:11:31,820
No.

2791
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:33,580
Let's see.

2792
02:11:35,540 --> 02:11:36,340
Oh, there we go.

2793
02:11:36,780 --> 02:11:37,220
Yeah.

2794
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:40,220
Like that.

2795
02:11:42,660 --> 02:11:44,320
We're doing this in real time, guys.

2796
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:45,660
We're doing this in real time.

2797
02:11:47,940 --> 02:11:48,860
Oops, wrong thing.

2798
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:49,800
Let's see.

2799
02:11:53,940 --> 02:11:54,740
Oh, yeah.

2800
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:55,100
Okay.

2801
02:11:55,160 --> 02:11:55,440
Got it.

2802
02:11:59,260 --> 02:12:00,160
Like around there.

2803
02:12:01,620 --> 02:12:02,020
Okay.

2804
02:12:02,500 --> 02:12:03,640
Let's do the garter belt.

2805
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:04,280
Can I?

2806
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:05,500
Can I do the garter belt?

2807
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:08,400
There we go.

2808
02:12:12,470 --> 02:12:12,870
Oh.

2809
02:12:13,210 --> 02:12:14,390
Just like that.

2810
02:12:15,870 --> 02:12:17,150
Oh, we gotta do the bows.

2811
02:12:17,450 --> 02:12:18,590
We gotta do the bows.

2812
02:12:20,370 --> 02:12:21,890
Add purple for extra goth.

2813
02:12:21,930 --> 02:12:23,290
Oh, we'll make the bows purple.

2814
02:12:23,550 --> 02:12:24,330
We'll make the bows purple.

2815
02:12:28,120 --> 02:12:28,860
Like that.

2816
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:34,660
Like so.

2817
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:35,300
Like so.

2818
02:12:36,920 --> 02:12:37,580
I know.

2819
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:38,420
This is...

2820
02:12:38,420 --> 02:12:40,840
This is maybe a little bit of...

2821
02:12:41,640 --> 02:12:42,340
Immersion breaking.

2822
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:42,900
I'm sorry.

2823
02:12:43,240 --> 02:12:43,720
But...

2824
02:12:43,720 --> 02:12:45,180
It's kinda cool to see.

2825
02:12:45,300 --> 02:12:46,920
Like this is...

2826
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:48,760
Kind of how...

2827
02:12:48,760 --> 02:12:49,940
I'm made up.

2828
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:50,200
You know?

2829
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:53,120
And we can do my...

2830
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:53,980
We can do my...

2831
02:12:53,980 --> 02:12:54,700
Bow tie...

2832
02:12:54,700 --> 02:12:55,080
Oh my god.

2833
02:12:57,040 --> 02:12:58,400
We can do...

2834
02:13:00,100 --> 02:13:01,440
The one on my neck too.

2835
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:05,060
And then...

2836
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:05,500
This one?

2837
02:13:10,140 --> 02:13:11,540
How do I make it more purple?

2838
02:13:12,120 --> 02:13:12,560
Hmm...

2839
02:13:15,140 --> 02:13:16,060
Maybe like that.

2840
02:13:17,860 --> 02:13:18,460
Oh wait.

2841
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:21,780
Maybe like that.

2842
02:13:25,100 --> 02:13:25,960
We are doing it.

2843
02:13:26,060 --> 02:13:26,640
We are doing it.

2844
02:13:28,300 --> 02:13:29,320
We are doing it.

2845
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:29,900
We are doing it.

2846
02:13:31,580 --> 02:13:32,140
What the?

2847
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:32,780
What the?

2848
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:33,560
No no.

2849
02:13:33,980 --> 02:13:34,600
There we go.

2850
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:35,900
Like that?

2851
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:44,120
Saying you're messing with your colors made me remember you could remove your skirt.

2852
02:13:45,280 --> 02:13:47,420
Mayhaps carry on with Minto 3.0.

2853
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:49,320
Honestly, I haven't tried yet.

2854
02:13:51,020 --> 02:13:52,920
I haven't tried yet, actually.

2855
02:13:53,880 --> 02:13:57,520
I'm not sure if it will be a thing.

2856
02:13:58,080 --> 02:13:59,580
I'll try, I'll try.

2857
02:14:13,260 --> 02:14:13,980
Okay.

2858
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:23,760
Okay!

2859
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:26,720
The brown doesn't really match, but whatever.

2860
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:28,360
And for my hair?

2861
02:14:28,660 --> 02:14:30,020
I wonder...

2862
02:14:33,700 --> 02:14:34,880
Let's see...

2863
02:14:35,620 --> 02:14:37,300
How can we...

2864
02:14:42,440 --> 02:14:42,960
Oh!

2865
02:14:44,780 --> 02:14:45,300
Oh!

2866
02:14:45,300 --> 02:14:46,760
It looks so cute!

2867
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:50,720
Oh, wait.

2868
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:57,380
I'm like dying my hair in real time.

2869
02:14:57,440 --> 02:14:58,040
This is crazy.

2870
02:15:04,040 --> 02:15:05,200
There we go.

2871
02:15:18,460 --> 02:15:19,240
There we go.

2872
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:25,340
You guys!

2873
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:27,520
That's so cute.

2874
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:32,740
Now I gotta move her.

2875
02:16:00,150 --> 02:16:00,590
Help!

2876
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:03,670
I'm fine.

2877
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:10,520
I think I messed up, you guys.

2878
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:12,340
Um, wait.

2879
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:13,300
I can fix it.

2880
02:16:13,380 --> 02:16:13,720
There we go.

2881
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:17,880
Wait, no, no!

2882
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:23,100
Wait, oh no!

2883
02:16:23,100 --> 02:16:23,280
No!

2884
02:16:23,800 --> 02:16:25,200
Wait, I got to get the color again.

2885
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:26,400
Wait, what was the color?

2886
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:30,200
Okay, I got it.

2887
02:16:31,160 --> 02:16:31,400
Okay.

2888
02:16:35,110 --> 02:16:37,410
There we go, there we go, there we go, there we go, there we go, there we go.

2889
02:16:38,330 --> 02:16:39,810
Wait, how do I fix that part though?

2890
02:16:41,850 --> 02:16:42,090
Wait.

2891
02:16:44,630 --> 02:16:45,370
Nope, nope, nope.

2892
02:16:50,300 --> 02:16:51,740
Oh, there we go, there we go, there we go, there we go.

2893
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:56,080
Oh, that's where I messed up.

2894
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:05,360
Sorry if this is so boring.

2895
02:17:05,580 --> 02:17:07,380
I'm like invested now, you guys.

2896
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:09,020
I'm like invested.

2897
02:17:09,080 --> 02:17:10,100
I need to finish this.

2898
02:17:10,320 --> 02:17:11,680
I need to finish my art.

2899
02:17:12,220 --> 02:17:13,780
I need to finish my art, okay?

2900
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:16,140
I'm invested, I'm invested.

2901
02:17:20,340 --> 02:17:21,160
It's not boring?

2902
02:17:21,640 --> 02:17:22,040
Okay.

2903
02:17:23,060 --> 02:17:24,120
You don't have to lie.

2904
02:17:24,300 --> 02:17:26,320
You can tell me the truth.

2905
02:17:28,700 --> 02:17:29,440
There we go!

2906
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:29,680
No?

2907
02:17:33,700 --> 02:17:35,020
I'm gothy now.

2908
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:39,900
Goth mean toe.

2909
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:41,980
Oh, the hair bows.

2910
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:42,800
You're right, you're right.

2911
02:17:44,020 --> 02:17:44,880
Let's fix that.

2912
02:17:55,600 --> 02:17:56,940
Or make them purpley.

2913
02:17:58,600 --> 02:17:59,220
Yeah, like that.

2914
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:08,480
One...

2915
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:11,000
And two...

2916
02:18:16,360 --> 02:18:17,040
And...

2917
02:18:18,460 --> 02:18:19,140
Three.

2918
02:18:19,220 --> 02:18:19,900
There we go!

2919
02:18:30,640 --> 02:18:32,480
I'm... but I'm not mint.

2920
02:18:34,460 --> 02:18:35,580
My identity.

2921
02:18:37,140 --> 02:18:38,200
My identity!

2922
02:18:39,980 --> 02:18:41,800
If I'm not mint, what am I?

2923
02:18:41,800 --> 02:18:41,980
Why?

2924
02:18:48,890 --> 02:18:49,850
I'm lilac.

2925
02:18:53,010 --> 02:18:53,810
I'm grape.

2926
02:18:56,250 --> 02:18:56,730
Oh.

2927
02:18:56,950 --> 02:18:59,410
This honestly reminds me of using the Gaia online hack.

2928
02:19:00,270 --> 02:19:02,450
Tech to find outfits and messing with the layers.

2929
02:19:02,690 --> 02:19:04,190
Wait, I have no idea what that is.

2930
02:19:04,910 --> 02:19:05,390
I'm...

2931
02:19:08,910 --> 02:19:09,390
Lavender.

2932
02:19:11,210 --> 02:19:12,170
Noted aphrodisiac.

2933
02:19:15,810 --> 02:19:16,370
No!

2934
02:19:16,510 --> 02:19:17,650
What is wrong with you?

2935
02:19:23,190 --> 02:19:24,290
Made eggplant.

2936
02:19:25,370 --> 02:19:26,610
We changed my...

2937
02:19:26,610 --> 02:19:28,210
Changed my oshi...

2938
02:19:28,210 --> 02:19:30,550
My oshi mark to an eggplant.

2939
02:19:32,410 --> 02:19:32,970
Grapefanta.

2940
02:19:38,870 --> 02:19:40,690
Well guys, this is fun.

2941
02:19:40,890 --> 02:19:42,150
Thanks for hanging out with me.

2942
02:19:42,270 --> 02:19:43,950
And letting me become made lilac.

2943
02:19:46,130 --> 02:19:47,610
Just for this special...

2944
02:19:47,610 --> 02:19:48,730
This special moment.

2945
02:19:48,910 --> 02:19:49,450
This is it.

2946
02:19:51,590 --> 02:19:52,410
Otsumito everybody!

2947
02:19:53,730 --> 02:19:54,170
Otsumito.

2948
02:19:54,550 --> 02:19:55,930
Thanks for hanging out with me.

2949
02:19:57,490 --> 02:19:58,370
Ako bitashikaru.

2950
02:19:59,130 --> 02:20:01,290
I gotta let my voice rest a little bit more.

2951
02:20:02,950 --> 02:20:04,450
Can we say googly eyed mint?

2952
02:20:18,060 --> 02:20:22,940
Pretty sure you can say this alpha toggle as a preset if you ever want to bust your out in jumpscare chat when you feel extra silly.

2953
02:20:25,580 --> 02:20:27,380
I'm always silly.

2954
02:20:27,720 --> 02:20:28,420
I'm always silly.

2955
02:20:30,060 --> 02:20:30,620
I'm always silly.

2956
02:20:34,280 --> 02:20:34,840
I'm always silly.

2957
02:20:34,840 --> 02:20:35,120
No!

2958
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:36,400
That is not solid mint!

2959
02:20:37,900 --> 02:20:38,860
How do I save?

2960
02:20:41,860 --> 02:20:43,160
It's not perfect though.

2961
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:45,760
Sorry I couldn't get some of the colors... absolutely.

2962
02:20:46,060 --> 02:20:47,620
It was very... it's rush job.

2963
02:20:48,740 --> 02:20:49,640
It's rush job.

2964
02:20:49,640 --> 02:20:49,780
It's rush job.

2965
02:20:59,400 --> 02:21:00,520
It's rush job.

2966
02:21:00,520 --> 02:21:01,920
I missed all the video games, you look cute.

2967
02:21:02,440 --> 02:21:03,920
Thanks for the super chat!

2968
02:21:04,140 --> 02:21:06,060
Thanks for dropping by, but anyway, you know.

2969
02:21:10,060 --> 02:21:10,840
Maya knows?

2970
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:11,300
Okay.

2971
02:21:11,480 --> 02:21:12,360
I'll ask Maya.

2972
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:18,000
Otsu lilac.

2973
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:18,440
No!

2974
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:19,320
Otsu Minto!

2975
02:21:20,100 --> 02:21:21,340
I'm always Minto!

2976
02:21:21,540 --> 02:21:21,980
Please!

2977
02:21:23,060 --> 02:21:24,560
I'm always Minto.

2978
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:33,000
Oh wait, this is the extra goth aesthetic.

2979
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:33,580
There you go.

2980
02:21:42,390 --> 02:21:44,210
Grab the lilac.

2981
02:21:44,490 --> 02:21:45,070
No!

2982
02:21:46,090 --> 02:21:47,710
New ocean lock.

2983
02:21:47,810 --> 02:21:49,250
I'm still the same!

2984
02:21:53,530 --> 02:21:54,210
Okay.

2985
02:21:55,470 --> 02:21:56,550
Anyway, whatever.

2986
02:21:57,450 --> 02:21:58,710
See you guys later.

2987
02:22:00,490 --> 02:22:01,510
Otsu whatever.

2988
02:22:01,870 --> 02:22:02,750
Or whatever.

2989
02:22:03,310 --> 02:22:03,870
Okay.

2990
02:22:03,990 --> 02:22:04,950
Like, bye.

2991
02:22:05,650 --> 02:22:06,510
