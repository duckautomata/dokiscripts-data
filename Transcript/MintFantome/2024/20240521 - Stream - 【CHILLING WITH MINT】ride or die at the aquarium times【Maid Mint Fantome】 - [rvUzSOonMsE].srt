11
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,350
You have customers.

12
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,570
They're doing their own thing.

13
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,550
They told me I walked over there and I was just like, would
you like me to serve you?

14
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,650
And they said, actually, please don't come over here.

15
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,330
Don't even look at us.

16
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,290
Don't even bother us.

17
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,430
So don't worry about it.

18
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,750
I think they're...

19
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,530
I think they're up to no good.

20
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:35,770
Amen.

21
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,810
Yes, I miss you.

22
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:38,730

23
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:42,730

24
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,070

25
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:45,770
Yeah, exactly.

26
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,550
Thank you!

27
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,690
Oh wait, hold on.

28
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:51,490
Oh!

29
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,330
Welcome back, boss.

00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,730

31
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,950
Thank you so much.

32
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,770
I went away.

33
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,650
Actually, if you listen to the...

34
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,250
If you listen...

35
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,710
Well, maybe for some people, you already know.

36
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,290
I talked about it in the podcast a little bit.

37
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:18,950
I went to...

38
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,870
Did you miss us?

39
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,660
Yeah.

40
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,000
Is that Jerma in your cafe?

41
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,400
Is that what Jerma looks like?

42
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,060
I don't think Jerma has glasses.

43
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,700
That's German.

44
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:50,740
Oh.

45
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,420
I talked about it a little bit on the podcast if you
listened.

46
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,000
If you listened today, thank you for listening.

47
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,880
If you haven't listened to it yet, thank you for listening
to it in the future.

48
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,220
And if you are haven't listened to it, why not?

49
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,840
Thank you.

50
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,120
And the waitress is too shy and introverted to call out the
customers bringing outside food into the cafe.

51
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,420
Wait, you're not allowed to do.

52
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:17,660
Bring it.

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:26,580

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,920
I was at the dentist during the podcast.

58
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,920
That's why.

59
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,160
You should have listened to it with your dentist.

60
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,920
They would have been like, oh my god, they would have had a
hold on your teeth.

61
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,640
They would have grabbed it.

62
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,000
They would have gripped it.

63
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,100
They would have firmly grasped it.

64
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:10,840
They would have been like listening to it and just gripping
your teeth in anticipation of what we were talking about.

65
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,060
The dentist would have said, based?

66
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:17,580
Based?

67
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:27,780
maybe I don't know but yeah I've talked about it I've said
this like three times now I've talked about it a little bit

68
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:44,000
on the podcast and I went to a convention I went to Anime
Central and I made a surprise appearance at Ayami Sensei's

69
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:54,600
panel it was so last minute oh my gosh it was extremely last
minute surprise question mark question mark okay it was a

70
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:06,100
surprise because there's there there was no plan for me to
be in that panel until maybe like 10 minutes before the

71
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:17,420
panel and then ayami sensei called to me she was like mito

135
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,560
Did you guys...

136
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:11,940
Hold on.

137
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,060
Let me get the picture.

138
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,840
From...

139
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,620
From Sensei's...

140
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,580
From Sensei's, uh...

141
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:19,980
Twitter?

142
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,320
Oh good, she's not Shadow Band anymore.

143
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,780
At least for a while, I couldn't search her.

144
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,150
Save image.

145
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,210
This is how the drawing came out.

146
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,770
LeBron James, scream if you love Mipin.

147
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,430
Ta-da!

148
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,590
Isn't it so cute?

149
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,790
She made me look so shy and cute.

150
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:12,970
Then people were telling me at the end of the panel that,
um, A strange shadow happened.

151
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,290
I don't know.

152
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,770
Like that was...

153
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:23,390
But when we talked, she said she was going to give me a hug
out.

154
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:24,590
What happened?

155
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,730
Did she get shy?

156
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,190
Maybe.

157
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,130
Maybe she got shy.

158
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,110
And made me as shy as she felt.

159
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,630
You know, who knows.

160
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,370
The shadow had sussy intentions.

161
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:39,510
Was it?

162
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,970
Was it...

163
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,030
Was it...

164
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,410
Was it...

165
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,610
A pickle shake?

166
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,990
What did it, what kind of shadow was it?

167
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:06,550
When people were saying that there was a sussy shadow, I was
like...

168
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,370
What do you mean by that?

169
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:08,790
Wow!

170
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:09,590

189
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,460
Oh my gosh.

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,160

191
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,740
I love Latina Sonic.

192
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,200
Shadow, like the headdrawn.

I need to get this framed and put on my wall.

198
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,730
No, Echie don't loot.

199
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,110
That doesn't sound like you.

200
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,470
Well, I mean, for me, I mean, I'm still embarrassed by it.

201
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,210
But I don't dislike Echie and loot things.

202
00:19:53,130 --> 00:20:08,970
knows that by now what was it oh oh i i was i was oh there

selling dojins i was so shocked how many there were and um

204
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:31,750
one of them was just like i'm haunted i'm hunted by
something and i i at the time i was just like oh i'll come

205
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:41,230
back for it because because um uh because i didn't have a
bag that could fit it that like i didn't want to carry it

206
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:57,670
around um i wasn't going back to my hotel room to put it

it was gone.

208
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,690
I was so surprised.

209
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,730
I was like, are ghosts in demand?

210
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:07,870
Maybe.

211
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,790
I think I know which one you're talking about.

212
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,730
Yeah, it's sold out.

213
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,230
Are ghosts in demand?

214
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,890
Yes, they are.

215
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,730
They saw you eyeing it?

216
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,150
No!

217
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:26,690
No, no, no.

218
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:27,330
They couldn't have.

219
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,970
I'm a ghost.

220
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:29,610
They couldn't have.

221
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,170
They couldn't have.

222
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,250
They couldn't have seen me.

223
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:32,890
I'm a ghost.

224
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:34,990
Mm-mm.

225
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,150
But I did, like, kind of haunt the booth a little bit.

226
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,510
I was like, oh, man.

227
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:44,570
Let's see.

228
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,990
What else is stuff that I bought?

229
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,670
I bought a blanket that also had ghosts on it.

230
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,710
It was so cute.

231
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,030
I saw it.

232
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,730
And I was like staring at it.

233
00:21:54,850 --> 00:22:03,110
I was like, I say it's a blanket, but it's like, it's very,
um, let me see if I can find the artist's name.

234
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:09,910
Because it's so, it's, it kind of reminds me of like, it's
like, when I looked at it, I just felt this overwhelming

235
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:15,170
sense of like, halloween and fall.

236
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,590
And it just made me so happy.

237
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:22,010
And so I didn't even think I just, I just bought it.

238
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,290
I was like looking at it, I was like, I think I need this.

239
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,990
Um, where's the artist's name?

240
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:36,810
Um, oh, the artist's name is Julia Likes Cats.

241
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,490
What a good name.

242
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,350
And it's like a, it's like a, let me see.

243
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,650
Actually, you know what, maybe I can find it.

244
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,270
Julia Likes Cats.

245
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,070
Blanket.

246
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,870
I think they called it a woven tapestry.

247
00:22:51,870 --> 00:23:07,780
but oh let me type tap tapestry oh this is it this is it I
found it I found it I found it hold on it's loading no

249
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:32,580
oh Okay, it's gonna be like the worst, most blurry picture
ever, but this is what it looks like.

250
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,680
Oh my god, it's even worse than I thought.

251
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,160
Look how cute this is.

252
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,980
I just saw it and I was like, this is so...

253
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,640
It's just so nice.

254
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,340
It's so like fall and everything.

255
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,120
Isn't it cool?

256
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,720
It's not a bad photo.

257
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,520
It's kind of bad.

258
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,360
It's a little bad.

259
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,060
Yeah, it's so cute So

260
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:17,980
Post stamp size Yeah, I saw, I got that I got some Dojinchi
I was like Looking through some old Dojinchi Some places had

261
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:29,420
like newer ones I got one from Kawari Because I really like
that artist and I got of course I got Ayami Dojin-si the

262
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:41,260
newer ones that I hadn't gotten yet Ayami-sensei and I oh I
was looking through some older ones and I found like an old

263
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:50,540
catalog of like from melon books that had like a bunch of
like they have like paceri in there but I barely even

264
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,940
recognize it as paceri art it's like I was like Wow, this is
like a real time capsule.

265
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,600
And I also had an older Dojinchi of another artist I like,
Kujo Ichiso.

266
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,060
So I got that.

267
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,140
And there wasn't much blue archive.

268
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,580
I got a little bit of blue archive.

269
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,340
Oh, there is a Metal Gear print.

270
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,240
I got that.

271
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,600
And I

272
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,170
think that's about it.

273
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:35,430
Someone though, someone gave something to give, someone gave
something to Ayami Sensei to give to me, which I was like,

274
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:36,290
huh?

275
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:41,010
I was so shocked because I was like, no one will have
anything.

276
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,230
Well, first of all, I didn't expect presents at all.

277
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,010
I didn't expect presents at all.

278
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:54,790
But also, I thought that there wouldn't be anything because,
because, you know, I was a surprise guest at the panel.

279
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,310
Nobody even knew I was there.

280
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:07,350
Um, someone, someone gave her a signed poster of, of a
signed Metal Gear poster, signed by Hideo Kojima.

281
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,890
To give to me, I was so shocked.

282
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,350
And it had like a nice little note that was like, dear mint.

283
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:20,790
This has been sitting in my, in my, what's the word?

284
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,170
Uh, in my closet for a long time.

285
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,750
I want you to use it and appreciate it.

286
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,430
Or, like, display it.

287
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,860
I felt so bad, though.

288
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,900
I was like...

289
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,700
I was like, oh my god.

290
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,100
Um...

291
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,220
I felt bad that they gave it to Ayami-sensei.

292
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,080
Because I was like, ah, you should be giving gifts to her.

293
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,700
Not to me!

294
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,340
I wasn't even a guest.

295
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:15,100
so that's so cute it was really nice though yeah it's a lot
of fun and the panel was really funny um overall i had a

296
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:24,760
good time uh the last time i went to anime syndrome i have
been before last time was many years ago so um but i've

297
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,060
always liked the convention itself and uh

298
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,280
So I...

299
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:36,800
Um...

300
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Yeah, I guess you were Ayami's guest.

301
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,400
Maybe.

302
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,900
I'm surprised they had it ready.

303
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,600
Me too!

304
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,400
Me, actually, though.

305
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,900
I was so shocked.

306
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,680
And...

307
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,420
Many years ago.

308
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,500
Wow, old!

309
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,680
That was years ago.

310
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,220
Um, oh my gosh, one of my favorite memories from...

311
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,700
From Anime Central is...

312
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:10,460
If you don't know, the convention is very close to an
airport oh my gosh thank you for the family gifted thank you

313
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:24,280
thank you so much thank you thank you so much oh my gosh
ojare yes ojare yeah it's very close to the airport and so

314
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:34,560
when I went it might have been the last time I went but the
artist Main, the singer, Main, was there.

315
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:48,100
And she's like the voice of Cheryl in Macross Frontier, but
she also was like a really big Annie song singer as well.

316
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:59,020
And so I remember, I remember in the concert, she was
singing Diamond Crevice, which is the like,

317
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:13,720
that song from macross and as she was singing it and like in
in the it was like the sun was setting and so it was really

318
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:20,540
beautiful out and it was like really sunny and the sun was
setting so the sky was kind of pink and then behind her

319
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:28,740
there was like an airplane flying at that moment as she was
singing it and so like i was like oh my gosh in my brain i

320
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:36,780
was like this this is this is macross so what and i just
remember my brain that whole time like i felt like i was

321
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:43,840
ascending into another dimension i was like this is the
coolest moment i don't think i could ever experience a

322
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:51,500
moment cooler than this ever it's one of those live moments
i still think about it to this very day and because of that

323
00:29:51,500 --> 00:30:03,740
because of that one moment anime central is one of my
favorite one of my gonna go um when she told me that she was

Larry, welcome the membership.

335
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,520
Thank you, thank you.

336
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,460
Sally and Maki too.

337
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,400
Yeah, I actually didn't get to see her.

338
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,540
I'm so sad.

339
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,020
My schedule always didn't always overlapped.

340
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:05,460
with her, but I'll play the next convention.

341
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,820
Going to my first anime con this weekend.

342
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,460
Wish me luck.

343
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,040
Good luck!

344
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,140
Oh my gosh!

345
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:16,840
But yeah, so it was just like it was so fun.

346
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:28,400
I went to all the Sayu panels and everything and so even
before even before I knew that they were going to be invited

347
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,940
I was going already for Ayami, so I felt really like, oh my
gosh, this is crazy.

348
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,120
What's your policy for gifts at Afkai?

349
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,680
That's a great question.

350
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,040
Thank you for asking.

351
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,680
Anything but food is okay.

352
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,220
Yeah, yeah.

353
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,420
Anything but food.

354
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,680
Well, That's at least what it said on the site.

355
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,340
I honestly don't mind, like, snacks, if they're wrapped.

356
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:10,760
But, like, no handmade food or anything like that.

357
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,680
It was my first con.

358
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:16,180
I went to meet Ayasuzaki and got her to sign my Nita Minami
CD.

359
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,200
Oh, my God.

360
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,840
I had a lot of fun even though I went alone.

361
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,420
Yeah, sometimes things like that are so fun even alone.

362
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,520
Oh, my God, Simran.

363
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,460
Thank you for one month.

364
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,400
Can I buy hard?

365
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,380
Thank you for the favorite.

366
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,120
Give the thank you!

367
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,300
Oh my gosh, thank you guys.

368
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,020
But, uh.

369
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,140
Um.

370
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,360
But yeah.

371
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,760
So, gifts are okay.

372
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,940
Which, I think, um.

373
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,600
Uh.

374
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,340
I don't, am I allowed to say this?

375
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,200
Um.

376
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:06,260
It will be like my first time receiving gifts so I'm really
excited about it because um uh back in heaven there were

377
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:16,700
times when people would give gifts and I um we were told
that we would receive them and I never received them and I

378
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:24,180
think about it all the time because I just feel so bad about
it how there were people that were giving certain things or

379
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:37,580
maybe bought something with their own money and then I just
the gift so um yeah uh i i don't know if like maybe maybe if

380
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:51,140
maybe i'm still waiting on it i don't know but um uh yeah so
but um even from previous times to like the i just uh people

381
00:33:51,140 --> 00:34:03,460
would give stuff and then it would just never show up in the
mail so i'm really sorry if that happened um But so That's

382
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:15,880
That's why I'm excited this time That I will actually Be
able to Be actually Actually be able to receive Receive it

383
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:26,460
So Heaven's customs are kind of crazy Heaven delivery caught
lagging There was stuff too That I was really looking

384
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,600
forward to But Um, yeah, so.

385
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,700
For heck, thank you for the 50 gift.

386
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,660
Thank you.

387
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,900
But I'm excited for this time, so.

388
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,400
Um, I don't know if...

389
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:47,400
Because I think for the gifts, it's maybe only for people
that got meet and greet stuff.

390
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,600
I will try to see if there's a way.

391
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,180
If you want to...

392
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:55,100
Not to say that you have to gift me anything or you know,
anything like that.

393
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:04,900
But if you want to gift something, I we'll see if there's a
way that you can gift it a place to gift it where I will be

394
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,760
able to receive it did you ever receive your letters?

395
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:19,520
I did receive those yes yes I did receive those so that's
why I thought it was strange that I never got the gifts as

396
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:26,360
well thought it was strange that they just didn't include it
and I don't know maybe if it was like a lack of

397
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:37,840
communication or if some one side you know if someplace sent
it and then whoever received it then didn't send it or if

398
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:45,820
the first place didn't say i don't know i don't know where
the lack of communication is happening i don't know i don't

399
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:54,840
have any contact anymore so uh yeah yeah i just think it's
kind of crummy if they say gifts are allowed and people give

400
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:00,320
gifts and then you know but anyway Ready to wave light
sticks for you on Anime North!

401
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,740
Thank you!

402
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,420
Thank you, thank you!

403
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,900
Guess, I guess now we know we can gift.

404
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,380
Yeah!

405
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,580
If you want.

406
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,120
If you want to.

407
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,100
You don't have to though.

408
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,220
Please don't feel like you have to.

409
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,320
Or if, but even if you just like want to write a letter or
something too.

410
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,340
That's okay too.

411
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:16,760
Yeah.

412
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,900
What's with the guy in the back?

413
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,320
He's having a barbecue with Snake.

414
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,160
It's Otakon.

415
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,480
I guess looking at it here, Otakon just looks like a random
guy.

416
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,820
He needs his lap coat.

417
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,520
He's casual Friday right now.

418
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:47,980
Time to write a letter.

419
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:48,960
Why do you have an egg?

420
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,060
Why you look so evil when you say that?

421
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,900
Labo, it's lizard!

422
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,140
Lizard!

423
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,740
Thank you for the gift.

424
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,580
Thank you!

425
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Excited and nervous to meet you at Hopkai.

Why did you get a...

428
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,200
Did you get a meet and greet?

429
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,020
Yubi!

430
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,560

431
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,910
Nali Pop, welcome to Membuship.

432

Thank you.

433
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,490
But yeah, there's been a lot of things.

434
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,970
I'm sorry that I'm kind of like low energy today because...

435
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,570
The weekend was so much.

436
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,250
And then...

437
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,790
The weekend was so much.

438
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:38,830
And then...

439
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,710
I came back and I was like...

440
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,590
I haven't thought of my schedule at all.

441
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,530
I should have pre-planned.

442
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,490
I should have planned my schedule for this week.

443
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,810
So I'm sorry I don't have a schedule.

444
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:50,310
yet.

445
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:51,550
And also,

446
00:37:54,570 --> 00:38:00,170
I, uh, I, what's the word?

447
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:06,730
Um, uh, I can't remember.

448
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:07,470
Sorry.

449
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:15,730
My wallet is still recovering from Japan two months ago,
even, so even though I've been meaning to do Asen, I

450
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:16,530
couldn't afford it.

451
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:16,910
Ah!

452
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,350
I think you'd really like it a lot, Ghost Talker.

453
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,050
Maybe you could ever go.

454
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:31,550
I didn't want to be angry, unfortunately, but if you see a
Zagreus cosplay with Kazoos in his server school's mouth,

455
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,330
that he has a gift for you.

00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:44,090
I wasn't sure if you answered this before, but are you okay
with people cosplaying as you?

506
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:44,770
Of course!

507
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:46,850
Have you want to?

508
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,950
I'm honored if you want to cosplay me.

509
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,790
Oh my gosh.

510
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:52,270
Good morning, Meg.

511
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:53,550
Good morning!

512
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,210
Good... Oh, Goo's Morning.

513
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,530
Sorry, Glenn German.

514
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,490
Goo's Morning.

515
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:00,790
Minto time.

516
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:01,770
Are you guys ready?

517
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,690
Oh, yeah!

518
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,090
Hold

519
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,240
on, let me refresh it.

520
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,720
We're watching fish!

521
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,600
Why should we watch?

522
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:31,460
I'm actually really interested in live spider cam.

523
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,160
Oh, sorry.

524
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,820
Spider crab cam.

525
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,240
Let's see.

526
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,350
Let's check it out.

527
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,420
Oh, there's music.

528
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,140
Oh, my God.

529
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,100
Wow.

530
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:47,940
Oh, my God.

531
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:48,780
This is so...

532
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:48,920
Oh.

533
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,900
This is so spooky.

534
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,580
Look at the size.

535
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,800
of that crab.

536
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,020
Why is it so spooky looking?

537
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,700
Why is their webcam or their live stream not working?

538
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,240
No.

539
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,020
No.

540
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,460
Okay, I guess we'll go to another one.

541
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,420
Let's try.

542
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,060
Let's try the live Monterey Baycam.

543
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,240
Oh, wait.

544
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,160
You guys can't see it.

545
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:19,680
Sorry.

546
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,520
It's cut off a little bit.

547
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,620
Let's try this one.

548
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:22,940
Whoa!

549
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,280

00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,580

Me too.

556
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,340
Look how cute they are.

557
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,880
Oh, they're jumping around.

558
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:11,920

559
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,500

561
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,780
You're not allowed on this little rock formation either
anyway.

562
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,060
Oh, wow.

563
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,080
Wait, does it move around?

564
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,300
Oh my gosh, I feel so at peace right now.

565
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,520
If you don't know, oh my gosh, there it is.

566
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,060
Thank you for the birthday gift and thank you so much!

567
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:43,540
If you didn't know, before I graduated many, many years ago,
I used to watch the Aquarium live cams.

568
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,100
My favorite streams are Meat Zatsu's.

569
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:46,820
Let's go!

570
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:51,640
I used to watch these just kind of hanging out.

571
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,300
And three years ago, many, many years ago.

572
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,370
The waves are so nice.

573
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:09,430
I know I feel really relaxed watching this.

574
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:10,510
Let's go see.

575
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,830
Some people said they want to see Otter Camp.

576
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:16,530
Ah!

577
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:22,370
There's just little guys!

578
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:23,490
Oh!

579
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:29,550
They're spinning and twirling and swimming around.

580
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:33,790
I wish I chilled with y'all sooner.

581
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,630
No, you're here now!

582
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:37,650
We're chilling!

583
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,250
What are you talking about?

584
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:39,890
You're here now.

585
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:41,550
I think it's...

586
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,330
Oh, he's so slick.

587
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:44,970
Oh, my goodness.

588
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:45,990
Oh, he's looking at me.

589
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:46,410
That's me.

590
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,090
He's looking at me.

591
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:51,650
Welcome

592
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,040
back.

593
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:01,900
Oh, there he is.

594
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,320
Yeah.

595
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,480
Wow, there's so many people watching this one.

596
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,720
200 people are watching this one.

597
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:09,400
Wow.

598
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,500
Hey, Aminto.

599
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:14,880
Hey, yo, dopo.

600
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,740
Thank you for your mind.

601
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,460
Thank you.

602
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,640
That was so baby.

603
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,640
There's three!

604
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,000
I hope they're having an enriched life.

605
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,480
We'll be watching them.

606
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:35,920
Yeah.

607
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:40,240
So we just can watch and talk and just kind of hang out.

608
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,320
And, you know.

609
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,580
Of course, if you want to ever...

610
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,820
These are live cams.

611
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,200
They're basically 24-7.

612
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,700
If you ever want to watch, it's the Monterey...

613
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:57,480
The Monterey, Monterey Bay Aquarium.

614
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,200
I keep getting these shorts of people that seem to have pet
river otters.

615
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:09,900
Pets?

616
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,020
I don't know about that.

617
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,440
I don't know about that.

618
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,040
Minto love.

619
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,040
Thanks, Nisoc, thank you.

620
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,180
I kind of want to see the penguins though, is that okay?

621
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:40,940

623
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,040
Look at that.

624
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:57,360
Oh.

625
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,760
Is that a penguin right there?

626
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:04,600
I can't tell.

627
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,180
Or is that a rock?

628
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,600
I don't think it's a penguin.

629
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,580
Oh, I imagine the smell.

630
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:19,400
Yeah!

631
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:23,380
No!

632
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,020
Let's go!

633
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,180
He did it!

634
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:36,960
He jumped off!

635
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,920
Did you see his little feet go?

636
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:39,680
Tap, tap, tap, tap.

637
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,780
Have you seen the live cams?

638
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:46,400
The what?

639
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,100
The what?

640
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,320
Live cams?

641
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,000
Here we see a group of poopy penguins.

642
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,960
Benny cabbage pie.

643
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,820
My cat just pissed on me!

644
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:58,580
Oh!

645
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,380
Can I have some words of comfort in these trying times?

646
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,780
I'm really sorry, Shin-chan.

647
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:08,580
Um...

648
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:09,820
You know, they say sometimes...

649
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:10,720
Oh my god!

650
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,480
Is this guy...

651
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,620
I thought he was using the restroom.

652
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,420
Um, you know, some say that when you get...

653
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:21,820
When you get peed on by something, it's good luck, right?

654
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,280
So...

655
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:26,500
Um...

656
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,520
Where's that pooped on?

657
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:35,050
I don't know.

658
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:36,810
Who says that?

659
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:38,950
I don't think anybody says that.

660
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:44,030
Oh, it's bird poop.

661
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:51,390
My cat threw up in his litter box, which actually rules.

662
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:53,670
I wish he would do that instead of the poor.

663
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:59,630
Everything about how ZVTubers are basically zoo animals.

664
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:04,750
We watched them frolic and play and occasionally throw
peanut super chats into their enclosures.

665
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:08,730
It was funny after the panel with Ayami Sensei.

666
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:17,390
Her manager, Ayami Sensei was like, Turn around, my manager
wanted to say something to you.

667
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,290
I was like, oh, okay.

668
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:22,870
Um, yes, sir.

669
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:28,870
And he just like starts making like, like he's like throwing
a baseball with both hands.

670
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:29,650
He like keeps throwing.

671
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:32,610
He's just like, Super chat, super chat, super chat, super
chat, super chat.

672
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,870
She was so silly.

673
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:39,090
She was so...

674
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,290
Oh, let's look at the shark, Kim.

675
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,440
Oh my god, that's a big fish.

676
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:50,480
No.

677
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,080
He just came up from nowhere.

678
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:55,760
Super chat.

679
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:56,660
No.

680
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,540
Damn it, it's my birthday today.

681
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,000
And I'm dropping by to say hello.

682
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,440
Lay, happy birthday.

683
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,220
I haven't been able to catch up with your streams.

684
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,060
Have a nice day, Minto.

685
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,100
Thank you.

686
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,320
Thank you so much for dropping by on your birthday.

687
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,900

00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,260
I like how many different types of sharks are in here.

711
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:06,680
Spot sharks, rays, and other fishes as they cruise through
our rocky reef.

Yeah, we're just chilling and talking.

725
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,920
And I don't really...

726
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,900
I'm trying to think of, you know, what else?

727
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,500
Oh my gosh, you can see the people, like, walking by.

728
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,920
It was kind of creepy.

729
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,420
Now I'm watching the people.

730
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,560
Now, now, now they're in the zoo.

731
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:43,760
Oh,

00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:48,340

00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:04,370
Thank you.

735
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:07,210
So...

736
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:07,690
Whoa!

737
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:08,890
Oh my god.

738
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:10,150

739
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:12,470
He just did a...

740
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:19,570
That guy just did a flip!

741
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:22,810
That guy just did a flip!

742
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,380
Hayao, what's your favorite ice cream flavor?

743
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,520
I like cookies and cream.

744
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,760
Do a barrel roll.

745
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:40,920
Do a barrel roll.

746
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,080
What else do we have?

747
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,400
What else do we have going on?

748
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,140
Oh, let's see, aviary cam.

749
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:52,060
Oh, they're so cute!

750
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,820
Oh, you can see the ocean from here too.

751
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,480
Look at that tiny little bird.

752
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,540
Look at that tiny little bird.

753
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,260
Oh my gosh.

754
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:04,840
This morning, my cat, Paz, she was looking out the window.

755
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,400
She loves looking out the window.

756
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,800
It's like her favorite activity to do.

757
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,060
It's her enrichment time.

758
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:15,780
is looking out the window and, you know, observing the
world.

759
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:20,960
She saw, she saw today, she saw a lizard and she stood up.

760
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,780
Ah, sorry.

761
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:26,620
Oh, God, they were really close.

762
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,820
Oh, my gosh, their beaks are kind of bent.

763
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,360
They have such interesting form.

764
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,880
God, they're huge.

765
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,940
They're really big birds.

766
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:54,160
But, uh, um, today in the tree, I saw the fattest bird I
think I've ever seen in my entire life.

767
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,580
This guy was so fat.

768
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:03,280
This guy was just a real... Wow, he's amazing!

769
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:05,920
Oh, no!

770
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,160

00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,960

00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,020
No, cameraman, stop the camera!

774
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,440
Stop the camera!

775
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,240
Oh, thank God.

776
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:27,940
Oh my God.

777
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,320
Oh, he's okay!

778
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,760
He just won't stop!

779
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,780
Oh, oh, he stopped.

780
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,000

00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,960
Your boy Steven Adams.

Thank you.

788
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:25,260
It was super cool to see with Ayami tasting snacks in
Chicago.

789
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:26,560
I hope Ayami passed.

790
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,240
Oh, Hong, a little gift airway.

791
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,700
She did, she did.

792
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,880
Hey, cameraman, there's nothing here.

793
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,340
Cameraman, show us the goods.

794
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,320
Show us the birds.

795
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,500
I'm in chill stream.

796
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:46,060
Also, man.

797
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,160
Ah, grain of sand.

798
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,300
What are you talking about?

799
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,680
I'm not excited about the sand.

800
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:51,680
Excited about the birds.

801
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,460
Oh, boy sand.

802
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,300
Where are they?

803
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,540
Where's the birds?

804
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:13,730
I think they're all dead.

805
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,280
Sometimes I think about if the world ended.

806
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:32,560
Oh.

807
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,480
Look how diddle, little, he's going around in circles.

808
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,200
Look how cute his little tippy-tops are.

809
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,140
Tippy-top, top, top.

810
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,680
Come over here, bird.

811
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,320
Come over here, bird.

812
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:50,560
Is it possible to deliver you a letter at virtual vacation
concert?

813
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,520
That, I don't know yet.

814
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,000
I can look into that, though.

815
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:54,920
I can look into that.

816
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,400
There they are.

817
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,640
The birds are back.

818
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,640
The birds are back in town.

819
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,720
Back in town.

820
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,280
The other guy was like a ghost signing.

821
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,680
Did Streamlabs don't alerts break?

822
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:20,820
I think they're very delayed because of the gifted.

823
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,140
I'm sorry, they'll show up eventually though.

824
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,940
I'm sure they will eventually.

825
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:31,220
Oh, I see that some have been donated.

826
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:32,560
I'm sorry.

827
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,200
More bathwater.

828
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,600
Oh, he's so wibby.

829
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,240
Oh, he's so cute.

830
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,400
This one kind of sucks.

831
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,180
Let's check out the kelp forest.

832
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,020
Whoa.

833
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,060
Whoa.

834
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,380
That's a lot of fish up there.

835
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,080
Wow.

836
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,640
Whoa.

837
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:14,720
I typically like the ones where I don't see the walls
because also the way the kelp moves is really

838
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:36,610
at 28 feet the kelp forest is one of the tallest aquarium
exhibits in the world

839
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:54,630
oh my god does that have to be so aggressive why was it like

What is up with this camera?

841
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:10,820
I feel so like calm with the way the kelp moves.

842
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:23,960
Oh my god, that's an ugly fish down there in the corner.

843
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,200
They're so ugly.

844
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:28,780
That guy's ugly too.

845
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,420
That guy's cool.

846
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:31,900
I like him.

847
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:33,900
That guy's cool.

01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:34,980

01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,020
Thank you, Mr. Cameraman.

855
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:39,700
Hey, Mint.

856
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,560
Did you know that recently scientists have discovered a
super terrifying plant?

857
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:47,620
It's named since shivers down my spine.

858
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,640
They call it bamboo.

859
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:56,320
Bamboo.

860
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:58,300
Terrifying.

861
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,100
Ever seen the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta?

862
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:01,740
Oh, God.

863
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:02,220
Sorry.

864
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,760
They have actual whale sharks and Manta rays.

865
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,300
Wait, Manta rays are the really, really, really, really...

866
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,460
I know whale sharks, but Manta rays are the really, really
big ones, right?

867
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,260
You know what I like to do?

868
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:18,120
I like to go to the stingrays.

869
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:19,840
And I like to...

870
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,700
You know how some aquariums have the...

871
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,380
Georgia Aquarium is amazing.

872
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,740
I wanna go!

873
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:28,800
Been there a few times in the past.

874
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:30,900
I wanna see a whale shark.

875
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:32,500
I wanna see...

876
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,900
I want to jump in here and show a fistful of seaweed into my
mouth.

877
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,160
Might be a little salty, I know.

878
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:39,600
Good night, Minto.

879
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,740
It's fun catching you stream.

880
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,520
Thanks, Damien.

881
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:42,300
Have a good night.

882
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:44,220
Um...

883
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:44,920
I like to...

884
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,640
The touch stingrays.

885
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:50,960
I like to put my hands underneath them and have them nibble
on my fingers.

886
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:54,960
It's a good experience.

887
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:08,780
Whoa!

888
01:03:16,010 --> 01:03:17,930
This one feels like a screensaver.

889
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:21,010
This one doesn't even feel real.

890
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:24,290
What are you eating?

891
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:25,830
Reese's Puffs?

892
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:30,190
Thank you, Luke!

893
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:31,090
Thank you!

894
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:38,590
Wow.

895
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:55,390
I feel like I need some more like ethereal kind of music
instead.

896
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:01,170
I love Mint as my GF and she has Boing Boing.

897
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:07,550
Are you okay?

898
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:17,510
Are you okay?

899
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,280
Uh oh.

900
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,000
Get some help.

901
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:38,440
It's okay.

902
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:43,960
It's okay.

903
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,560
Jellyfish, that's it done.

904
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:46,880
Yeah, basically.

905
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,180
Minj is with Ayami now.

906
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,260
Let her go.

907
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,300
There's the Jellyfish Music anime this season.

908
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,000
Oh, yes.

909
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,680
I have heard about it.

910
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,240
I don't know anything about it, though.

911
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,900
What is what is it about?

912
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:27,440
There's a few shows that I've been wanting to watch this
season.

913
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,060
Oh, that reminds me.

914
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,440
I have to watch Blue Archive.

915
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:38,300
Um, I've seen this jellyfish stream for 50 billion hours.

916
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:39,300
It's my favorite.

917
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,260
I'm somewhat of an avid diver.

918
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,840
My most favorite moments are when I'm under and I get to see
all kinds of sea life.

919
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:52,420
I've seen dolphins, some small sharks, and the most
memorable is the lionfish.

920
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,260
Whoa, aren't those poisonous?

921
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,700
Do not pee on jelly stings.

922
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:57,800
I think you're supposed to.

923
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,680
You're supposed to pee on jelly stings.

924
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:05,260
If anybody in here got stung by a jellyfish.

925
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:06,340
I'd pee on you.

926
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:09,820
So that you wouldn't die.

927
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:10,660
So don't worry.

928
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,240
I got you, homie.

929
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,280
I got you.

930
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:22,620
I got stung, mint.

931
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:23,480
Help!

932
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,440
Did you?

933
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:31,500
Did you really?

934
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:33,560
Thanks.

935
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,160
I think.

936
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,340
I would help a homie out.

937
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,460
Minto being a bro.

938
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:50,720
Homies would pee on each other to save them from the
jellyfish stings.

939
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:57,290
Ghost can pee.

940
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:00,330
Don't think about it too hard.

941
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:05,270
Don't think about it too hard.

942
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:06,810
Thanks for the gift of every...

943
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:10,530
I thought the pee wars were over.

944
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:12,590
Was there ever a war?

945
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:19,530
Planet of the Apes.

946
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:27,290
Help, I've been st- Tuna.

947
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:30,130
Oh, Tuna.

948
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:33,910
Oh, Tuna.

949
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:37,230
Oh, Tuna.

950
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,120
I don't think I'm going to make it.

951
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:57,040
Help me out here.

952
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:59,360
Spears likes the strawberry jelly.

953
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,900
Do you need a tampon?

954
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:04,000
Are you okay, mister?

955
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:10,180
Why do you use the strawberry jelly?

956
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:12,240
Do it?

957
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:12,940
It's his birthday.

958
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,520
This is actually your birthday, too, no?

959
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,540
Strawberry jelly equals jellyfish.

960
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:36,400
Um.

961
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:38,060
I don't think...

962
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:38,980
I think so.

963
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,120
I'm never...

964
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,940
Mint, please, it's Tudas' birthday duel for the birthday
boy.

965
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:49,840
Stop peer pressuring me!

966
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:57,060
I went to do research before you...

967
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:57,920
Before I what?

968
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,460
Oh, pounce on the next dogen.

969
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:02,080
I suspect the theme is developing.

970
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:09,100
No, the one that I got recently was a hypno...

971
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:22,020
one I think I'm kind of into into the hypnosis recently
don't

972
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:48,830
worry there's nothing else in it Minto please say my name
with contempt to this looks

973
01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:59,000
good like a wallpaper.

974
01:09:59,200 --> 01:09:59,900
I know, right?

975
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,340
That's why I keep it up.

976
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:06,420
Like, actually, recently at night, when it's, actually, hold
on.

977
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:08,620
You're not going to hear anything real quick.

978
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:14,360
I kind of want to hear what the music they have on for this,
if it's like a, oh yeah, it's kind of like a

979
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,620
just like that.

980
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:56,300
Just like that.

981
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:09,920
what was i saying oh i um at night i put on like a it's like
a it's not a live stream but it's like a it's like a crazy

982
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:18,480
like eight hour long video or something like that and it's
just of like it's it's jazz and then it's like Tokyo at

983
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:27,600
night and it just switches between some videos of Tokyo at
night and akabane welcome to membership that's my face What

984
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,820
are you trying to summon, Minto?

985
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:36,890
Oh,

986
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:44,920
a snack.

987
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:51,500
And one day, Batara offers to walk on us and Mint to pee on
us.

988
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:52,780
Good day to be in the room.

989
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:59,860
Only under extreme circumstances, and you must be stung by a
jellyfish.

990
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:06,330
It's my good friend, Bob.

991
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:09,930
Bob's birthday.

992
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:12,850
He got into an accident and can't use his arms.

993
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:14,470
Can you wish him a happy birthday for me?

994
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:15,950
I can.

995
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,150
I'm just gonna say Bob, though.

996
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:21,070
Because I'm scared.

997
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:24,830
Okay, cut that part out.

998
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:26,450
Don't tell him that I'm scared.

999
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:27,750
Okay, cut that part out.

1000
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:30,650
Don't tell him that I've been burned before.

1001
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:32,150
Cut that part out.

1002
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:39,030
Happy birthday.

1003
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:41,030
Happy birthday to you.

1004
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:44,050
Happy birthday to you.

1005
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:48,610
Happy birthday dear Bob.

1006
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:54,270
Happy birthday to you.

1007
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:57,150
Can I

1008
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:04,750
get a happy birthday too?

1009
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:05,530
It was in January.

1010
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:07,290
No, you can wait until January.

1011
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:09,830
It's already the middle of the year, you guys.

1012
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:12,730
It's almost the end of May.

1013
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:15,370
Next month.

1014
01:13:15,370 --> 01:13:25,090
in a couple days in like in like a week and a half it will
be the middle of 2024

1015
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:47,800
back when So Senkyo was a borderline national holiday in
Japan and Iota would buy thousands of singles to vote was

1016
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:54,760
this behavior based or a cringe follow up was So Senkyo
rigged or not thanks

1017
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:14,720
um let's see hmm um you know I have to wait till March sorry

Happy birthday to you.

Happy birthday, dear Salias.

1023
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,500
Happy birthday to you.

1024
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:45,420
Just

1025
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:52,040
the jellyfish thing need to be recent because I've been
stung before as a kid.

1026
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,360
Oh, Takizo's winning the running, everybody!

1027
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:00,620
Oh no, Takizo.

1028
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:03,000
I think you just put a target on yourself.

1029
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:05,600
Okay.

1030
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,080
So Senkyo.

1031
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:10,380
For those who don't know, So Senkyo was like this...

1032
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,620
I mean, I think they still do it in AQB, right?

1033
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,760
They have a...

1034
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:20,200
They have this big event where...

1035
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:22,660
It's just a voting.

1036
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,040
It's a ranking event, essentially.

1037
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:24,740
That's all it is.

1038
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,380
And then you vote for your favorite member of AQB48.

1039
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:33,380
And then whoever is in like the top 16 or is like the top
girls in the group.

1040
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:35,220
And they get...

1041
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:41,620
whoever's number one is the center for the next single and
things like that so they haven't done so thank you since

01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:13,420
And I've participated before.

1046
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:19,280
I've, I've bought like, it wasn't a lot.

1047
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:20,700
I think it was like two CDs.

1048
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:23,520
So honestly, I made zero difference.

1049
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:33,800
But I, um, the people that would buy so many, I, you know
what, No, I don't think that was based.

1050
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,200
I think it was a waste.

1051
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,340
I don't think that was based.

1052
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:40,880
I don't think so.

1053
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,200
I don't think that was based.

1054
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:44,460
I think...

1055
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:45,720
I think...

1056
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,560
Because, you know...

1057
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:48,140
I think it was...

1058
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:50,000
Yeah, I don't think it was based.

1059
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:52,200
Cringe then?

1060
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,340
Yeah, I guess I could say it was kind of cringe.

1061
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,100
And I just don't like...

1062
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:04,230
I don't really like when...

1063
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:06,930
When...

1064
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:10,430
When something is like...

1065
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:16,430
Just so solely based on...

1066
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:21,230
How much money someone can spend.

1067
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:22,870
I don't know.

1068
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:26,770
That just feels like kind of wrong.

1069
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:36,290
Like if I were in something like that, I wouldn't want
anybody, any one of you any of you guys yeah pay to win

1070
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:42,910
basically yes it's just pay to win and i feel like if i were
in that same situation and people in it like i wouldn't want

1071
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:50,430
you guys to spend your money to like vote for me and things
like that i just it just doesn't feel it just doesn't feel

1072
01:17:50,430 --> 01:18:05,470
good you know so yeah i don't know like if that makes you
happy then who am i to stop you but if it's like just it's

1073
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:13,770
just you know how much of that were the girls getting and
all especially for that for like so thank you like you had

1074
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:21,810
to buy so there were people buying tens and thousands of CDs
like an insane amount someone at Miku Expo Newark a couple

1075
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:29,770
weeks ago paid me 120 dollars for my two-year-old Daisenko
200 with a broken strap and low batteries and a Miku insert

1076
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:42,810
film because the official $20 for a dice that go 200 stonks
stonks

1077
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:57,150
oh that's funny but you know it's funny it's like funny
because i say that but then at the same time there are times

1078
01:18:57,150 --> 01:19:11,950
when i buy a bunch of cds for like a but I'm not buying
thousands of CDs I'm buying like 10 or 20 CDs so I don't

1079
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:21,330
know one time I bought a bunch of CDs for a Kickstarter well
like I think they came with the Kickstarter and then I got

1080
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:32,350
like some extra perks like I got a video and I got stuff
like that and I got I got some of them were signed by each

1081
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:43,140
member so yeah but i think it's if it's like a if it's for
something like to get a checky for yourself then it makes

1082
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:50,580
sense but if it's a like vote for someone to be the most
popular in our group i just don't like i don't know i never

1083
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:59,760
really liked so thank you i'll be honest i just didn't i
just always thought it felt kind of icky you know pay to win

1084
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:12,800
pay to win just makes me feel icky not in this economy you
know you can't do that in this it would be so bad anyway

1085
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:19,760
sage welcome to my buship it's totally an investment to get

01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:46,700
Expensive.

1092
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:47,760
Oh my gosh, fun.

1093
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:49,000
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

1094
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:49,660
Thank you.

1095
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:51,780
Thank you so much.

1096
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:56,260
Yeah.

1097
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:57,640
Yeah.

1098
01:20:58,180 --> 01:20:58,620
Yeah.

1099
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:07,100
Let's go to another one.

1100
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:08,580
Hmm.

1101
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:22,760
wait there's moon jellies too oh they're so pretty now
actually I don't know which one I like more I think I like

1102
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:31,520
the other one more because the trails have like a better

1103
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:40,380
you for the 20 gifted gracias thank you I feel like I like
the other one better.

1104
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:45,480
I feel like this one need, they need more, but look at that.

1105
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:49,280
That, it looks like the moo, the sand dollars, right?

1106
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:52,360
Looks like the design on a sand dollar.

1107
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,520
Oh my god, I want to eat this.

1108
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:56,180
Oh god.

1109
01:21:56,620 --> 01:22:02,260
Oh my gosh, someone earlier on Twitter, they posted slime
that they made of me, and I've never bought slime before,

1110
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:04,320
but I'm gonna buy it and I think I'm gonna eat it.

1111
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:12,040
It says do not eat on What if I'm just...

1112
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,440
Just one like...

1113
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,120
You know?

1114
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,840
Slime eating stream.

1115
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,020
Do not eat it, Mint.

1116
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,080
But I really want to.

1117
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:32,360
I'll call poison control.

1118
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,580
Will I actually be poisoned?

1119
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:38,100
Oh no.

1120
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,280
Pee in my mouth.

1121
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:42,900
Don't do that, Emmerine.

1122
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,520
I think I regret saying that.

1123
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,420
Let's move on to the next thing.

1124
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,880
What haven't we looked at?

1125
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,620
Did we look at the live open sea camp?

1126
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:53,480
Whoa!

1127
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,360
Why are there so many bubbles?

1128
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:05,060
You are alive, young lady.

1129
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:06,520
Here it goes.

1130
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:07,460
What are I going to do?

1131
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:08,080
Exactly.

1132
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:08,720
What am I going to do?

1133
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:09,480
Die again?

1134
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:10,540
Mint.

1135
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:11,000
No!

1136
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:12,280
Say that, Evan!

1137
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:31,980
Okay, I think this one will trigger some, like, what's that
fear of the deep ocean?

1138
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,240
The fast less foam phobia.

1139
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:41,480
I think this one would kind of trigger that in some people
because the dark, like, the background is so dark and you

1140
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,260
just see the fish kind of coming out of nowhere.

1141
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:49,780
I passed my certification.

1142
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:54,280
Certification exam after work after stinging of months.

1143
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,860
I celebrated by ordering an iMass figure.

1144
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:58,640
Let's go.

1145
01:23:59,380 --> 01:23:59,380
Congratulations.

1146
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,040
I got here to go.

1147
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:00,840
I knew you got.

1148
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:01,780
I knew you had this.

1149
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,940
I knew you had this.

1150
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:04,300
Mint.

1151
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:05,820
No, don't say that.

1152
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,500
It fish jump scare.

1153
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,500
Do you guys have that phobia?

1154
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,320
Oh, they're zooming.

1155
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:27,680
I was stung by tiny jellyfishes when our family was on a
trip to the beach and turned out The whole beach was

1156
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:31,620
infested by it Later that day, the beach was closed because
of it Holy cow!

1157
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,920
I've never had, um...

1158
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:37,620
I've never had a jellyfish sting, but, um...

1159
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,200
What was it?

1160
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:49,000
I remember going to the beach once as a kid, and I don't
think I got it, but my sister got sea lice, which I didn't

1161
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,120
even know was a thing.

1162
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:52,340
Did you guys know that sea lice is a thing?

1163
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,440
I'm gonna go back to the birds.

1164
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:00,940
Oh, or the beach.

1165
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:04,300
What is sea lice?

1166
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:05,620
I don't know.

1167
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:09,200
But it, like, I remember it caused, like...

1168
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,580
Hold on, I'm going to look it up.

1169
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:13,210
Sea...

1170
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:16,100
Sea lice.

1171
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,260
They're little tiny creatures.

1172
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:20,860
They're copepods.

1173
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:21,680
Oh, no!

1174
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:26,240
They're copepods.

1175
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:28,960
Copipot.

1176
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:35,760
But they cause all these really bad bread bumps all over my
sister's leg.

1177
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,520
Sand fleas.

1178
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:42,660
I don't know.

1179
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:45,320
Ew.

1180
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:46,800
Don't look at the pictures.

1181
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:49,340
Copipot.

1182
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:53,960
Going to sleep on the floor, I wanted to tell you.

1183
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:54,360
I love you.

1184
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:55,260
You're my favorite nerd.

1185
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:57,580
a fun nerdy stream.

1186
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:58,740
Here you go.

1187
01:25:58,980 --> 01:25:59,500
Good night.

1188
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,740
I thought Kojima made those up for MGS2.

1189
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:05,440
What, the sea lice?

1190
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:07,460
No, those were different, weren't they?

1191
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,340
Those were the...

1192
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:10,280
What were they?

1193
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:10,940
Fleeze?

1194
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,320
Sea fleas.

1195
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,940
Are they real sea fleas?

1196
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:17,260
Or they were different kind of...

1197
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:18,260
Pod.

1198
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:27,740
Remember one time, a jellyfish spawning season almost
destroyed an aircraft carrier.

1199
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,460
I was on by clogging up all the cooling water.

1200
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:33,420
That's crazy.

1201
01:26:44,770 --> 01:26:47,270
But sea lice are very tiny.

1202
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:51,950
They're small, small little guys, I'm pretty sure.

1203
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:56,650
They're teeny tiny and then they get on you and they...

1204
01:26:56,650 --> 01:27:03,770
And then they give you bad rash and it happened to my
sister.

1205
01:27:07,470 --> 01:27:10,150
Top Gun in the movies versus Top Gun in real life.

1206
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:11,710
What do you mean by that?

1207
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:14,350
How did you know I watched Top Gun?

1208
01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:17,250
I had a question about Top Gun.

1209
01:27:17,970 --> 01:27:18,730
Is there...

1210
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:20,850
Do bird strikes, like, really happen?

1211
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:23,190
Is that really something that can, like, just take out a
plane?

1212
01:27:23,550 --> 01:27:25,470
If a bunch of birds run into a plane?

1213
01:27:27,890 --> 01:27:29,870
Do you watch Top Gun every time?

1214
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:31,170
Yes!

1215
01:27:34,210 --> 01:27:35,090
Yes, I do.

1216
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:41,710
The carrier almost got destroyed just because sea lice
clogged up the cooling water.

1217
01:27:41,810 --> 01:27:43,030
Sounds like a chill issue.

1218
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:46,210
It's very dangerous.

1219
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:48,390
Can take down even big planes?

1220
01:27:48,570 --> 01:27:49,010
Oh no.

1221
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:50,110
New fear.

1222
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:51,790
New fear.

1223
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:53,470
Rashes?

1224
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:54,550
Oh, it's alright.

1225
01:27:54,630 --> 01:27:55,790
We're talking about sea lice.

1226
01:27:57,070 --> 01:28:00,150
If sea lice exist, do sea monkeys groom themselves of them?

1227
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:00,730
Ew.

1228
01:28:03,810 --> 01:28:04,330
Spent.

1229
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:04,950
Spent.

1230
01:28:11,290 --> 01:28:12,310
Flam!

1231
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:15,420
Smento.

1232
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:19,030
Hmm.

1233
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:27,050
Hudson Bay Miracle Landing caused by birds.

1234
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:34,370
Look up Bash Bird Animal Airstrike.

1235
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:36,330
Airstrike Hazard.

1236
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:57,070
bird wait what was it bird animal I think that animal is not
necessary but it's irrelevant right bird animal hazard these

1237
01:28:57,070 --> 01:29:13,910
bird slash wildlife aircraft strike hazard Wow oh my god
this is so funny the picture they use for this is so funny

1238
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:22,190
it's like this the bird like looking directly at the camera
a bird strike is what caused the plane to go down in the

1239
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:31,010
hudson wait no it didn't long time donator pilot or first
time viewer a bird strike is actually what took down the

1240
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:37,850
plane captain solenberg was piloting that became the miracle
on the hudson in 2011 wait seriously Wait.

1241
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:40,650
Bird strike.

1242
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:43,130
What's...

1243
01:29:43,130 --> 01:29:43,950
No way!

1244
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:50,470
Wait, I'm seeing 2009.

1245
01:29:59,230 --> 01:30:01,170
I remember hearing about this, though.

1246
01:30:04,370 --> 01:30:05,530
That's so scary.

1247
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:07,370
So how do they...

1248
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:09,770
Owl would, like, you know, you're flying.

1249
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:13,210
What, do you have, like, radars that show where birds are?

1250
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:15,530
Like, how do you avoid that?

1251
01:30:17,410 --> 01:30:18,950
Oh, I don't know.

1252
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:19,950
I saw that bird.

1253
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:23,810
Look at chicken cannons.

1254
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:25,310
They fire them for tests.

1255
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:26,510
I'm not going to look at them.

1256
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:28,890
They made a movie, I think.

1257
01:30:29,050 --> 01:30:29,530
Really?

1258
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:32,890
Hudson River, two years ago.

1259
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:35,610
Not sea lice.

1260
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:37,630
Giant jellyfish clogged up the carrier's intakes.

1261
01:30:37,810 --> 01:30:39,650
They were being scraped off for days.

1262
01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:40,770
Oh, gross.

1263
01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:44,370
If you like Top Gun, have you ever considered playing Ace
Combat.

1264
01:30:44,510 --> 01:30:49,170
People like to describe it as MGS with fighter jets without
how over the top the story gets.

1265
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:49,710
I do!

1266
01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:57,050
Um, probably, uh, once I get back from Japan, I'll probably
start Ace Combat.

1267
01:30:58,350 --> 01:31:02,050
Um, I don't know which one to start from, though.

1268
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:03,270
I'm still trying to decide.

1269
01:31:03,490 --> 01:31:11,070
But probably once I get back from Japan, because I'm trying
to avoid, actually, or, maybe in August I can start it.

1270
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:17,750
Because I'm trying to avoid it with, like, some of my bigger
events that I'm, you know, if I'm going out of town or

1271
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:19,330
something like that, so...

1272
01:31:20,510 --> 01:31:21,710
Wait, you're going to Japan again?

1273
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:22,550
I am!

1274
01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:25,750
I'll be going to Japan again with Matara this time.

1275
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:28,250
We actually have some plans that we'll be doing.

1276
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:30,810
But I'll still be streaming while I'm there.

1277
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:34,890
She and I decided we're going to be streaming every other
day together.

1278
01:31:35,230 --> 01:31:40,070
So we're going to be like, one day she'll be streaming and
then, you know, you might hear me in the background.

1279
01:31:40,210 --> 01:31:43,310
I might be like, Matara, I'm...

1280
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:44,910
Taking a shower.

1281
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:48,650
Don't go streaming in the bathroom.

1282
01:31:49,950 --> 01:31:51,090
Stuff like that.

1283
01:31:54,290 --> 01:31:58,310
And we plan to at least...

1284
01:31:58,310 --> 01:31:58,630
Let's see.

1285
01:31:58,670 --> 01:31:59,770
What time is it now in Japan?

1286
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:02,570
We hope to stream...

1287
01:32:02,570 --> 01:32:06,750
It will probably be a little bit later than our usual
streaming times.

1288
01:32:06,890 --> 01:32:13,210
But we're going to try and stream at our usual times.

1289
01:32:13,330 --> 01:32:18,750
So we'll wake up early in stream and then go about our day.

1290
01:32:19,190 --> 01:32:21,530
But there might be also some nighttime ones on our end.

1291
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:23,870
So hot tub stream.

1292
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:33,980
She went to the bathroom.

1293
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:36,460
She would find a wisp with a jellyfish sting on the floor.

1294
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:39,680
How would you get there?

1295
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,800
First of all, I would say, how did you...

1296
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,740
I would say, where did this jellyfish come from?

1297
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:47,820
I think that's what I'd say first.

1298
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:49,860
And I'd say, why are you in my house?

1299
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:58,360
Shout out to Giri's house soon to be Matara's house Well,
the plan is that we're rooming together But if she wants to

1300
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:06,880
go to Giri's house More room for me I guess Why is nothing
happening on this live stream?

1301
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:11,400
Sorry guys, I picked a really lame one Let's go back to
Otter Camp

1302
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:15,600
So cute

1303
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:31,880
The jellyfish was luggage i've seen a girl oh they're here
they're here so many vids thank you thank you for haunting

1304
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:37,120
everyone at asen this past weekend hope you shower hope
you're showered with gifts in the future and in honor of

1305
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:44,360
your cafe guests here's a little philanthropy thank you
thank you so much

1306
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:56,020
um i don't remember what i was saying Rosa the otter.

1307
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,500
You guys know the names of the otter here?

1308
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:00,020
Oh, wait, sorry.

1309
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:02,660
I'm seeing if they...

1310
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:08,440
These female sea otters are all rescued and non-releasable
to the wild for health or behavioral reasons.

1311
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:11,360
They play an important role for their species at the
aquarium.

1312
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:17,920
Not only as ambassadors to otter kind for our guests, but
also as surrogate mothers for stranded sea otter pups.

1313
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:20,140
Oh, that's so sweet.

1314
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:33,120
the volleyball scene oh my gosh it's so funny because when i
was watching top top gun maverick um on this trip i found

1315
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:43,240
myself i was like skipping through all the relationship
draws which usually i eat that up usually i'm just like you

1316
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:51,860
know i like to watch romance movies sometimes and things
like that like whatever but this time i was skipping through

1317
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:56,900
all i was I was like, I don't care about you, lady.

1318
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:59,600
And then I would be like, get to the mission already.

1319
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:07,340
Which I found very different from what I'm usually like.

1320
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:11,200
Oh my god.

1321
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:12,340
Robo!

1322
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:14,980
Thank you for the very big Akadodo.

1323
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,400
I mean, I finally passed my defense and signed a job offer
last week.

1324
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:23,280
I've had some tough times.

1325
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:24,860
Tough times never last, buddy.

1326
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:27,460
And I really want to thank you for always being around and
being me too.

1327
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:29,080
By the way, I put you in my acknowledgement.

1328
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:32,100
I hope you don't mind it.

1329
01:35:35,950 --> 01:35:37,170
Oh my gosh, thank you.

1330
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:38,610
Like, congratulations.

1331
01:35:39,390 --> 01:35:40,410
Oh my gosh, congrats.

1332
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:44,730
I knew you had it.

1333
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:47,950
You had it in you the whole time.

1334
01:35:49,150 --> 01:35:50,470
Oh my gosh, congrats, Robo.

1335
01:35:50,530 --> 01:35:52,350
Thank you so much for the really big Akadono.

1336
01:35:52,670 --> 01:35:53,110
Thank you.

1337
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:56,390
That's so fun.

1338
01:35:56,510 --> 01:35:57,130
Oh my gosh, I don't think you're going to do that.

1339
01:35:57,150 --> 01:35:59,730
I don't think I've ever been in an acknowledgement before.

1340
01:36:01,670 --> 01:36:04,350
Oh my gosh, what did you say that I, what did I do?

1341
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:12,910
Provided a minty fresh experience.

1342
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:13,890
Remind, wait.

1343
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:18,250
Was your thing on me?

1344
01:36:21,470 --> 01:36:26,350
There was a streamer named Doug that raised 300K for Rosa
the Sea Otters birthday.

1345
01:36:27,150 --> 01:36:27,650
Wow!

1346
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:29,410
That's incredible.

1347
01:36:30,930 --> 01:36:39,410
They actually on the Monterey Bay Aquarium YouTube, they
have a donation thing that says, We get by with a little

1348
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:41,390
kelp from our frogs.

1349
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:43,350
But you can donate.

1350
01:36:43,470 --> 01:36:45,590
It says total raise is $20,000.

1351
01:36:46,950 --> 01:36:48,330
I think I'll raise that.

1352
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:56,060
Have you heard about the surfboard thief sea otter?

1353
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:56,820
I'm not.

1354
01:36:58,780 --> 01:36:59,960
By say.

1355
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:02,080
Thanks for a month.

1356
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:02,700
Thank you.

1357
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:07,660
9 out of 10 dentists recommend Mint Phantom.

1358
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:16,460
Almost 4K...

1359
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:17,980
Oh, sorry, I don't look at the numbers.

1360
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:20,300
Sorry, don't tell me how many people are watching.

1361
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:22,420
Four people are watching.

1362
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:23,100
Spooky number.

1363
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:26,740
Thank you for...

1364
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:28,160
Thank you guys for hanging out with me.

1365
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:29,520
I really appreciate it.

1366
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:33,100
We're not even, I'm not even doing anything.

1367
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:34,660
I'm barely even talking about anything.

1368
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:39,760
Mint time.

1369
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:39,880
Oh.

1370
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:41,380
Don!

1371
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:43,140
Thank you!

1372
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,520
Thank you, thank you.

1373
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:48,740
I'm one of the four.

1374
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:51,860
It's calm.

1375
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:52,980
Yeah, we're just chilling.

1376
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:54,220
We're just hanging out.

1377
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:55,500
Chilling with Mint.

1378
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:59,220
I'll change the title and stuff afterwards.

1379
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:01,220
Whoa, he just went through the door!

1380
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,860

I, but today was quite busy for me.

1383
01:38:15,740 --> 01:38:19,520
I was catching up with a bunch of...

1384
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,520
Actually, I haven't caught up with emails yet.

1385
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:24,220
I've caught up with messages, I believe, to people.

1386
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:31,600
I had to pay a bunch of people because I was paying for,
like, art for the Patreon postcards for the podcast.

Hold on.

1399
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,380
Uh, maybe it was under here.

1400
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,240
Oh my god, he's crawling!

1401

01:39:52,540 --> 01:39:54,840
He looks just like Butaro!

1403
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:57,340
He looks just like Butaro!

1404
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,040
No way.

1405
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:07,800
Oh my god that looks just like my cat That looks just I

1407
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:14,620
See you on Upkai I'm even going to the May Cafe After you're
meeting me Thanks, Rude!

1408
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:17,640
Okay, I think I found it.

1409
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:25,880
Oh wait, um No, these are all my idle videos Oh my gosh, oh
my gosh!

1410
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,740
Oh my gosh, I didn't even know I had these on here Oh!

1411
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:31,440
There's videos of me...

1412
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,720
Okay, so a long time ago...

1413
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:35,940
My Yoshi...

1414
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:39,440
I would do, like, video calls with her.

1415
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,400
And, um...

1416
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,120
You're not allowed to record them.

1417
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:47,360
So I would record myself talking to her.

1418
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:53,540
So I would set up my camera behind me so that...

1419
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:56,080
But not enough so she could see that I was recording it.

1420
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:57,800
So I have...

1421
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:59,160
Oh my god.

1422
01:40:59,300 --> 01:40:59,820
Oh my god.

1423
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:02,020
It's me sitting in my closet.

1424
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,500
Like, back when I used to stream in my closet.

1425
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,500
Oh my gosh, I had no idea that that video was there.

1426
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:10,240
That's so funny.

1427
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:11,940
Wow.

1428
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:20,460
I also have...

1429
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:22,640
Sorry, I'm looking through my pictures folder right now.

1430
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,420
Which I don't have a ton of stuff in here.

1431
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:27,900
But I have a folder called Google Earth VR.

1432
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:29,320
And the only...

1433
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:30,480
I don't know why I have this.

1434
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:34,320
The only thing I have in here is...

1435
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:37,840
But I think it's upside down.

1436
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:42,160
And also, it's called schwanggao.jpg.

1437
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:46,980
Did I take this?

1438
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:49,920
Schwang.

1439
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:51,560
Schwang.

1440
01:41:52,660 --> 01:41:53,500
Schwang.

1441
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:56,900
It's somewhere in Germany.

1442
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:59,800
I don't know why I have this.

1443
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:02,960
I don't even remember using Google Earth VR.

1444
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:06,480
Okay, I'm still looking for the video.

1445
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:09,760
It's not under videos.

1446
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:14,660
Maybe...

1447
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:18,900
I still need to open the door in my microwave.

1448
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:22,280
It'll turn on automatically while it's open.

1449
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:23,500
Do you think it's a ghost?

1450
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:26,320
Wait, your microwave is turning on while the door is open?

1451
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:28,500
I think you need to throw that away.

1452
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:30,160
I think you need to disassemble that.

1453
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:32,520
I think that's not safe.

1454
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:34,720
I think that's...

1455
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:35,740
Pretty bad.

1456
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:42,640
You put your Schwanggao away, young man.

1457
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:48,840
Have you ever gone flying upside down over the German
countryside?

1458
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:51,160
Apparently I have in Bihar.

1459
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:55,360
You know, I can't keep still.

1460
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:58,080
I'm crazy out of control.

1461
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:07,320
Where could it be?

1462
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:10,800
Where could it be?

1463
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:15,360
I thought it was under here.

1464
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:16,500
Wait, what is this?

1465
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:22,710
I don't know.

1466
01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:28,270
Hmm.

1467
01:43:33,050 --> 01:43:34,070
Somebody stop her.

1468
01:43:35,010 --> 01:43:37,090
Now this is gonna drive me crazy, though.

1469
01:43:38,910 --> 01:43:40,390
This is gonna drive me crazy.

1470
01:43:46,030 --> 01:43:46,730
You know what?

1471
01:43:46,730 --> 01:43:47,450
I just had an idea.

1472
01:43:48,170 --> 01:43:48,690
Yeah.

1473
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:51,310
I had an idea.

1474
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:53,830
For people who can't make it to the meet and greet.

1475
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:55,470
Hmm.

1476
01:43:55,770 --> 01:43:56,330
Maybe, maybe.

1477
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:07,590
If I can't find the video today, I'll find it eventually,
and then I'll show it eventually.

1478
01:44:08,290 --> 01:44:08,390
Sorry.

1479
01:44:08,650 --> 01:44:10,070
I really have no idea where it's at.

1480
01:44:10,410 --> 01:44:11,050
Where it's at.

1481
01:44:11,850 --> 01:44:13,050
But I saw it recently.

1482
01:44:13,190 --> 01:44:16,050
Wait, that means the other videos that were in there are
gone too.

1483
01:44:17,050 --> 01:44:18,910
No, where's all my stuff?

1484
01:44:21,390 --> 01:44:21,830
Idea?

1485
01:44:23,910 --> 01:44:24,350
meetup?

1486
01:44:24,650 --> 01:44:26,410
Stop spoiling it!

1487
01:44:26,990 --> 01:44:29,010
What if we meet in VR chat?

1488
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:33,350
But I don't have a, I don't have a model.

1489
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:37,350
I don't have a 3D model I could use.

1490
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:37,970
Hmm.

1491
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:40,150
Please, I lost the meet and greet.

1492
01:44:40,570 --> 01:44:41,590
Wait, Mo!

1493
01:44:41,930 --> 01:44:44,810
You don't need a meet and greet to meet me.

1494
01:45:00,490 --> 01:45:01,410
Frog model?

1495
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:04,890
Would you love me even if I'm a frog?

1496
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:08,790
What is this guy doing over here in the corner?

1497
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:12,690
He's like circling around with his tail.

1498
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:15,410
What is he doing?

1499
01:45:17,530 --> 01:45:18,550
I think he's playing.

1500
01:45:23,970 --> 01:45:24,410
Wee!

1501
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:31,260
Yes?

1502
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:32,220
Probably.

1503
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:34,500
Okay.

1504
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:36,980
I love you even if I'm a frog.

1505
01:45:40,490 --> 01:45:42,110
I would love you more if you were.

1506

01:45:57,430 --> 01:45:59,190

01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:30,120
Swim suit.

1514
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,980
I thanked my friend Mint for unconditional emotional
support.

1515
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,440
I haven't come out as a weeb yet.

1516
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:45,620
I was too shy to say my Oshi.

1517
01:46:47,140 --> 01:46:48,620
You're a weeb.

1518

Yorgo floor.

1526
01:48:00,260 --> 01:48:02,900
Never Akasupas when I can acknowledge it.

1527
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:06,920
It must be really important to you to get the Phantom boy.

1528
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:13,680
I wasn't going to Ofkai because I was scared.

1529
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,680
But someone convinced me to go.

1530
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:18,980
Didn't win the lottery, but I was drawing fan art to give to
you.

1531
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:19,680
It's bad.

1532
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:20,160
No!

1533
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:23,820
I'm excited to go to my first condo.

1534
01:48:23,980 --> 01:48:25,420
Thanks for making me go out of my comfort zone.

1535
01:48:25,820 --> 01:48:26,740
Oh my gosh, Amelia!

01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:29,180
I hope you have a wonderful, wonderful time.

1537
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:30,560
I hope we can meet somehow.

1538
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:36,360
Got home from Jim.

1539
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:37,380
Very tired, reproductive.

1540
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:38,720
Watch the podcast during.

1541
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:42,440
I'm wondering if you're able to show us the pick of your two
cats getting along.

1542
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:44,840
Oh, I posted it on Twitter sideways.

1543
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:47,660
Sorry that the editor missed it.

1544
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:51,500
But yeah, I had to use...

1545
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:55,800
I had to use chopsticks for my Greek food, and I felt really
silly about that.

1546
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:00,380
So I was just like, gosh, I feel like a weeb in this regard.

1547
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:07,460
But then, when I was hanging out with Ayami-sensei and our
managers and everything, they were just like, you know,

1548
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:12,400
Minto, are you sure you're American?

1549
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:15,500
I was like, I mean, I...

1550
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:18,700
Thank you, I guess I'm an American ghost.

1551
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:19,460
Choo!

1552
01:49:19,740 --> 01:49:21,300
Thank you, Yanwei!

1553
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:26,380
If my health improves, I'd love to go to a con and give you
my Rex and Ray model kits.

1554
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:26,940
Oh my gosh.

1555
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:30,880
They're painted Itasha style with an unrelated VTuber on
them.

1556
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:32,160
So that would be weird.

1557
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:34,800
So would that be weird or inappropriate?

1558
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:37,680
I might still make Mint Itasha versions later.

1559
01:49:38,820 --> 01:49:39,120
Oh!

1560
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:43,120
I don't know if I would be able to bring them back without
breaking them, though.

1561
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:43,960
I'd be so nervous.

1562
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:48,680
But I would love to accept.

1563
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:57,680
them even still if you are willing to part with them i feel
bad you put them together and painted them and everything

1564
01:49:57,680 --> 01:50:13,820

But yeah, when I was hanging out with Ayami Sama...

1570
01:50:55,070 --> 01:50:58,010
Sama Sensei's manager...

1571
01:50:58,010 --> 01:50:59,330
She is Ayami Sama to me.

1572
01:50:59,690 --> 01:51:02,010
When I was hanging out with her manager and stuff, they were
like, Are you sure you're American?

1573
01:51:02,130 --> 01:51:03,030
And I was like...

1574
01:51:05,590 --> 01:51:07,030
I... I mean, I...

1575
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:10,070
I don't remember quite where I died, but I think I died in
America.

1576
01:51:11,290 --> 01:51:13,030
And they were like...

1577
01:51:13,910 --> 01:51:15,390
They were like, You...

1578
01:51:15,390 --> 01:51:17,050
You act too Japanese.

1579
01:51:20,270 --> 01:51:27,590
They're like, I was like, well, I have like, you know, I
have family in Japan too, but they were like, you act, you,

1580
01:51:27,770 --> 01:51:33,850
the way you, you, your manner is, everything is way too
Japanese for you to be American.

1581
01:51:34,130 --> 01:51:36,410
I was like, in my brain, I was just like, this is it.

1582
01:51:37,790 --> 01:51:43,830
This is, this is what every weeaboo probably ever aspires to
have said to them.

1583
01:51:44,690 --> 01:51:45,770
You have assimilated.

1584
01:51:46,170 --> 01:51:46,670
I know.

1585
01:51:47,450 --> 01:51:48,230
I am.

1586
01:51:50,210 --> 01:51:58,430
And I've been told before, it's so funny, I've been told
before, like one time I was in a taxi, I was getting driven

1587
01:51:58,430 --> 01:52:08,370
home by a taxi driver in Japan, and he was talking with me,
and he was just like, wow, you're like, you know, Japanese

1588
01:52:08,370 --> 01:52:15,490
is good, and this and that, whatever, and you like, you seem
very Japanese, I think, I think you are reincarnated

1589
01:52:15,490 --> 01:52:20,010
Japanese, well, I don't know, like, my past go.

1590
01:52:20,410 --> 01:52:24,190
You know, it was, you know, it's kind of confusing, I guess,
when you bring reincarnation into it.

1591
01:52:24,670 --> 01:52:27,770
But, he was just like, I think you were once Japanese in a
past life.

1592
01:52:27,850 --> 01:52:35,410
And I was like, I don't, I'm, you guys, I'm a, I'm a
Japanese princess.

1593
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:41,240
Sorry, hold on.

1594
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:46,900
It's, I cannot, I don't know what's wrong with YouTube
raids, but the thing, look at it.

1595
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:48,080
I have to screenshot it.

1596
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:50,060
I cannot, I think it said, Nauru.

1597
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:52,300
Thank you for the...

1598
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:52,820
Raid!

1599
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:53,600
Thank you!

1600
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:55,540
Thank you so much!

1601
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:59,260
This is what I see when I get a raid.

1602
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:00,680
Something's wrong with YouTube.

1603
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:07,160
I can't see the name of the person.

1604
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:09,360
Look at this.

1605
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:10,940
This is what shows up.

1606
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:12,080
Oh yeah, I see it.

1607
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:13,420
Yeah, Ruchu!

1608
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:14,800
Thank you for the raid!

1609
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:19,240
It's just white!

1610
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:24,780
Thank you for the gifted ducky.

1611
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:25,440
Thank you.

1612
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:27,880
Did you die by truck gun?

1613
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:28,400
Hmm.

1614
01:53:28,780 --> 01:53:29,500
Who knows?

1615
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:36,000
Yeah, sorry if I missed somebody's raid because I can't read
it because YouTube is broken.

1616
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:40,100
YouTube's actually broken.

1617
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:42,180
White on white.

1618
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:42,660
Sasuga.

1619
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:50,020
Yeah.

1620
01:53:50,620 --> 01:53:51,500
Everybody coming in.

1621
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:52,980
Hi, I'm a Japanese...

1622
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:54,360
Well, I'm dead.

1623
01:53:54,540 --> 01:53:55,020
I'm a mint.

1624
01:53:55,140 --> 01:53:55,820
I'm a ghost.

1625
01:53:56,320 --> 01:54:01,000
I died, but I'm also maybe was once a Japanese princess and
pre-incarnated.

1626
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:03,560
And then I died again, I guess.

1627
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:08,300
Two Japanese people have told me that I'm a Japanese.

1628
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:10,380
Well, he didn't say I was a Japanese princess.

1629
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:18,780
I've had the white on white YouTube problem for the last
week.

1630
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:19,640
It's so weird.

1631

Oh, oh.

1656

Oh my goodness.

1657
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:08,740
But this guy I think has had an ex- I think- either he's
molting or he just shit himself.

1658
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:10,380
This guy needs a diaper.

1659
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:13,100
Look at him.

1660
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:16,380
He's shit himself looking at the Riaju penguins over here.

1661
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:21,080
There's a couple here, there's a couple here and he's just
looking on with envy.

1662
01:56:25,060 --> 01:56:26,300
It's even worse now.

1663
01:56:26,420 --> 01:56:27,080
I think it is.

1664
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:30,500
I don't remember seeing this calamity on the rock.

1665
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:32,480
And who did this?

1666
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:35,760
Who pooped all over the rock?

1667
01:56:35,860 --> 01:56:37,400
It's sliding down.

1668
01:56:42,450 --> 01:56:44,710
This is so sad.

1669
01:56:45,190 --> 01:56:46,350
It's cuffing season.

1670
01:56:46,510 --> 01:56:47,910
And this guy's got lonely.

1671
01:56:51,170 --> 01:56:53,070
He actually doesn't look too good.

1672
01:56:53,170 --> 01:56:54,070
I'm kind of concerned.

1673
01:56:56,090 --> 01:56:57,450
I hope he's alright.

1674
01:56:58,270 --> 01:56:59,330
Like, maybe he's, like, over...

1675
01:56:59,330 --> 01:57:01,670
Like, maybe it is molting, and he's, like, overly plucked.

1676
01:57:01,750 --> 01:57:03,310
Like, he's, like, plucking and everything.

Yeah.

1698
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:40,420
GrapeCun.

1699
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:42,580

Starlet Yuki, welcome back.

Excited for the concert.

1704
01:58:50,420 --> 01:58:50,880
Thank you!

1705
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:52,740
Thank you so much.

1706
01:58:54,620 --> 01:59:04,240
Man, a group of wisps are planning an Antarctica cruise for
winter 2024-25 any tips or recommendations oh um i don't

1707
01:59:04,240 --> 01:59:15,320
know uh i would say go earlier in the season because i think
that's when it's less crowded like go when it's still like

1708
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:25,000
spring into summer in antarctica um because i think it's
less crowded than there's less other trips going at that

1709
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:30,060
time as well, so it will be a little bit more secluded, I
think.

1710
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:34,700
Get on a bigger boat.

1711
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:39,100
If you want to avoid seasickness, yes.

1712
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:39,800
Ah!

1713
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:40,480
Sorry.

1714
01:59:40,860 --> 01:59:41,520
Oh my god.

1715
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:44,440
That guy just pooped all over the place.

1716
01:59:44,860 --> 01:59:47,360
No wonder there's streaks on the ground.

1717
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:53,080
Don't do it again.

1718
01:59:53,300 --> 01:59:53,940
Don't do it.

1719
01:59:54,060 --> 01:59:54,900
Don't do it.

1720
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:56,500
Don't do it.

1721
01:59:57,480 --> 01:59:58,340
Do it!

1722
01:59:58,880 --> 01:59:59,380
No!

1723
01:59:59,940 --> 02:00:00,400
Penguin!

1724
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:02,040
Please!

1725
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,600
Is he laying down?

1726
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:04,980
Okay, good.

1727
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:07,360
He just laid down.

1728
02:00:14,890 --> 02:00:16,590
Primed and ready.

1729
02:00:20,010 --> 02:00:22,330
I wonder, there's streaks everywhere.

1730
02:00:24,670 --> 02:00:25,310
Just...

1731
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:26,370
Penguins are gross.

1732
02:00:27,170 --> 02:00:28,030
They are.

1733
02:00:29,190 --> 02:00:30,090
Do it again.

1734
02:00:30,190 --> 02:00:30,790
I missed it.

1735
02:00:30,830 --> 02:00:31,570
Here I can wind...

1736
02:00:32,070 --> 02:00:33,630
I can wind the camera back.

1737
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:35,370
Wait, I think I went back too far.

1738
02:00:35,510 --> 02:00:35,970
Whoa!

1739
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:37,550
more up here.

1740
02:00:40,330 --> 02:00:41,450
Here, hold on.

1741
02:00:41,550 --> 02:00:43,630
Here, oh, there, there it is.

1742
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:49,210
There you go.

1743
02:00:55,990 --> 02:01:04,530
Um, but unless you, it depends also on what you want to see
because when I went, it was, the penguins are still looking

1744
02:01:04,530 --> 02:01:08,090
for places to lay their, lay their eggs.

1745
02:01:08,110 --> 02:01:18,990
and start nesting and stuff but for um later in the season
you can see the eggs hatch and stuff so it really depends on

1746
02:01:18,990 --> 02:01:35,800
what you want you know you guys oh poops refuses to
elaborate sleeps that's the circle of life baby i missed you

1747
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:40,540
singing live but i want it i wanted to say thank you for
singing I love your singing.

1748
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:41,560
Thank you, Starfan.

1749
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:42,760
Thank you so much.

1750
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:44,940
Fixy, you walk on the bamboo ship.

1751
02:01:45,820 --> 02:01:47,040
I thought this was a wholesome stream.

1752
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:48,520
It is, it is, it is.

1753
02:01:49,060 --> 02:01:50,180
Wholesome, wholesome, wholesome.

1754
02:01:50,700 --> 02:01:51,560
Good dog.

1755
02:01:57,180 --> 02:02:03,440
But, yeah, if you want a bigger boat, I was saying, bigger
boats will help with the seasickness during the Drake

1756
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:04,160
Passage.

1757
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:09,460
But a smaller boat, the more...

1758
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:13,820
The bigger the boat, the less you can go out on to
Antarctica.

1759
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:16,520
So...

1760
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:18,180
Thank you, Murphy!

1761
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:22,560
I was gonna ask, how long till she cries over animals being
cute?

1762
02:02:22,820 --> 02:02:24,480
I wasn't fast enough.

1763
02:02:25,720 --> 02:02:27,440
Why is it because I cried over the bird?

1764
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:30,220
Stop judging me.

1765
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:31,940
I just like animals, okay?

1766
02:02:33,060 --> 02:02:34,700
I think animals are very cute.

1767
02:02:37,180 --> 02:02:38,360
Is this still the beach?

1768
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:39,720
Yes, come on.

1769
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,200
Shrimp week.

1770
02:02:45,220 --> 02:02:48,200
Um, go back to the short camp.

1771
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:49,440
Wow!

1772
02:02:57,260 --> 02:02:58,620
Um, but...

1773
02:02:58,620 --> 02:02:58,860
Thank you.

1774
02:02:59,420 --> 02:02:59,780
Choo!

1775
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:01,480
Thank you!

1776
02:03:02,420 --> 02:03:03,580
Are you applying?

1777
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:04,440
It's okay.

1778
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:05,220
Are you applying?

1779
02:03:05,660 --> 02:03:06,080
It's okay?

1780
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:07,120
You mean implying?

1781
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:07,600
Hey.

1782
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:10,660
It's okay to drink men's bath water.

1783
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:15,640
Um, that's what I was saying, though.

1784
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:26,720
there's a number a limited number of people that can go that
can go out onto land at a time on in in antarctica so the

1785
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:35,740
bigger the boat the less opportunities you'll have to go out
multiple times because they will be accommodating um they

1786
02:03:35,740 --> 02:03:43,180
will be accommodating more people to go out and usually like
the staff is like not so big of people going like people

1787
02:03:43,180 --> 02:03:44,740
leading people out

1788
02:03:50,180 --> 02:03:53,920
So, yeah, that's why it's probably better to take a smaller
boat.

1789
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:58,100
Even if it's the Drake Passage, it's not as good.

1790
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:01,240
I corrected myself.

1791
02:04:07,420 --> 02:04:10,900
I am judging and the judgment is that you cute.

1792
02:04:16,900 --> 02:04:17,640
Look here.

1793
02:04:19,320 --> 02:04:20,080
Look here.

1794
02:04:24,140 --> 02:04:34,320
I don't need I don't need I don't need you guys always going
around and saying weird things and saying things that are

1795
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:38,040
not real I don't know why I just said real

1796
02:04:42,660 --> 02:04:48,660
marriage I'm angry that I just said that

1797
02:04:59,560 --> 02:05:03,180
I'm angry I'm angry at the world right now.

1798
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:22,780
Marriage.

1799
02:05:33,710 --> 02:05:35,030
Existence is hard.

1800
02:05:41,590 --> 02:05:44,310
I can't even say life is hard because I don't live.

1801
02:05:45,130 --> 02:05:45,690
I'm dead.

1802
02:05:46,630 --> 02:05:48,030
I can't even say life is hard.

1803
02:05:49,270 --> 02:05:50,650
After life is hard.

1804
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:03,900
Words are hard.

1805
02:06:04,580 --> 02:06:05,720
Unlife is hard.

1806
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:11,640
What was I saying?

1807
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:14,140
Yeah, have a fun time in Antarctica.

1808
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:15,840
Whenever you can go.

1809
02:06:16,940 --> 02:06:19,780
Whoever super chatted before about going with the wisps.

1810
02:06:20,580 --> 02:06:22,000
Actually, can I come?

1811
02:06:24,420 --> 02:06:25,940
Can I get an invite?

1812
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:29,360
Because I just want to go back.

1813
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:35,760
If you don't mind, I mean...

1814
02:06:45,940 --> 02:06:47,200
That's when I go back.

1815
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:47,900
It's so awesome.

1816
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,400
Yeah, just stuff me in your suitcase.

1817
02:06:56,580 --> 02:06:57,160
I can fit.

1818
02:06:57,420 --> 02:06:59,240
My ectoplasm is moldable.

1819
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:02,300
You can follow in a rowboat.

1820
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:05,220
She's only half joking.

1821
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:05,880
It's true.

1822
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:23,020
It's true Oh my gosh I just want to go back To Antarctica Go

Giant trip to Antarctica.

1831
02:08:40,700 --> 02:08:41,040
Wow!

1832
02:08:41,940 --> 02:08:43,000

1835
02:08:57,320 --> 02:08:59,020
I think that's the edge of the tank.

1836
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:03,020
No, we tried.

1837
02:09:06,100 --> 02:09:07,420
Oh, we tried.

1838
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:08,160
Oh, my gosh.

1839
02:09:08,420 --> 02:09:08,940
Oh, my gosh.

1840
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:10,100
That was the best moment.

1841
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:12,360
Oh, my gosh.

1842
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:13,760
That was the best moment.

1843
02:09:16,280 --> 02:09:18,220
Finally, something I'm near to.

1844
02:09:22,460 --> 02:09:23,600
He was listening.

1845
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,220
Mambo ship chartered cruise to Antarctica.

1846
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:26,880
a win.

1847
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:32,360
It's funny because I was even looking it up recently.

1848
02:09:33,380 --> 02:09:35,720
I was like, what if?

1849
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:42,420
But, um, when I got my tickets, they were 50% off?

1850
02:09:44,020 --> 02:09:44,600
Or more?

1851
02:09:44,780 --> 02:09:45,420
I can't remember.

1852
02:09:46,340 --> 02:09:52,540
But they were definitely way cheaper than the price that
they were on the website when I looked, and I was like, ugh,

1853
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:54,320
a little paid.

1854
02:09:55,640 --> 02:10:09,800
So, and i didn't even i didn't even write that trip off as a
tax it's like a as like a write off with a tax write off i

1855
02:10:09,800 --> 02:10:22,940
didn't even do that even though i guess it technically kind
of went for work but i just you know i misspelled mambuship

1856
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:32,360
to relaxing yourself when getting burnt out during con
because i know relaxing myself by playing games at ace

1857
02:10:32,360 --> 02:10:40,500
combat during the convention oh during a convention i'll go
find like a panel and i just sit in the back and i just you

1858
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:45,440
know even if it's not something i'm super interested in i'll
just kind of sometimes sometimes i become interested in it

1859
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:54,980
so like how recently um like maybe a couple

1860
02:10:58,060 --> 02:10:59,820
Like maybe like two weeks ago.

1861
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:07,720
How many days did I spend at Antarctica?

1862
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,340
The Drake Passage is many days.

1863
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:11,660
The Drake Passage was two and a half days.

1864
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:13,940
And so I was...

1865
02:11:13,940 --> 02:11:19,860
So it was like five days on the Drake Passage.

1866
02:11:19,940 --> 02:11:22,040
If you count there and going back.

1867
02:11:23,340 --> 02:11:25,700
And then in Antarctica it was about...

1868
02:11:28,460 --> 02:11:30,800
Six or seven, I think six days.

1869
02:11:36,350 --> 02:11:36,950
I think.

1870
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:44,680
Sometimes you just need to chill in the backseat of a panel.

1871
02:11:44,900 --> 02:11:45,580
Rest your legs.

1872
02:11:45,880 --> 02:11:46,360
I know.

1873
02:11:48,060 --> 02:11:48,460
Kawek!

1874
02:11:48,580 --> 02:11:50,200
Oh my gosh, thank you for the 50 gifted!

1875
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:51,520
Thank you!

1876
02:11:52,080 --> 02:11:53,840
Wait, I hope I said your name right.

1877
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:55,380
I'm really sorry if I didn't.

1878
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:56,760
But thank you so much!

1879
02:11:57,280 --> 02:11:58,400
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1880
02:12:00,360 --> 02:12:01,580
Thank you for the 50 gifted.

1881
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:05,020
How seasick were you?

1882
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:08,500
Not so bad.

1883
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:11,980
I almost threw up once, but that was it.

1884
02:12:13,180 --> 02:12:22,180
And sometimes I would feel a little nauseous, but I would go
outside and the cool weather really helped me a lot.

1885
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:25,480
I'm the organizer of that group of Wisps going to

Chisato.

1935
02:15:34,010 --> 02:15:47,710
in Lico Rico and and she I was getting her autograph and she
asked me like she asked me about going to aquariums and

1936
02:15:47,710 --> 02:15:58,750
stuff and I was just like I was like I want to I want to go
or what did I say hold on I'm trying to think of this well

1937
02:15:58,750 --> 02:16:06,970
she asked me if I've ever seen the garden eels at an
aquarium before and I was like she asked me in Japanese

1938
02:16:06,970 --> 02:16:14,950
obviously and I was like not familiar with what they were
called in Japanese and I was like huh?

1939
02:16:15,870 --> 02:16:18,890
because we were talking in Japanese before I know!

1940
02:16:18,990 --> 02:16:19,450
Chidango!

1941
02:16:21,970 --> 02:16:26,930
Shouji asked me about the garden eels and I was like huh?

1942
02:16:27,730 --> 02:16:28,250
Wait what?

1943
02:16:28,570 --> 02:16:33,510
She's like have you ever seen them at an aquarium before?

1944
02:16:33,950 --> 02:16:35,510
And I was like, huh?

1945
02:16:37,150 --> 02:16:43,710
And then eventually the interpreter there, she was just
like, have you ever seen the garden eels?

1946
02:16:43,910 --> 02:16:44,710
The garden eels.

1947
02:16:45,010 --> 02:16:45,910
I was like, oh!

1948
02:16:46,970 --> 02:16:51,750
And I went, mmm, not!

1949
02:16:52,470 --> 02:16:56,390
And like, it was so funny, I guess, because of, like, how
much I was confused.

1950
02:16:56,770 --> 02:17:03,750
And then my reaction to her, to her, like, question, she,
like, bust out laughing.

1951
02:17:03,950 --> 02:17:04,830
And it was so cute.

1952
02:17:05,010 --> 02:17:08,650
And I was like, oh, oh, he, he, he, ha, ha, ha, woo, hoo.

1953
02:17:09,190 --> 02:17:13,290
And afterwards, my friends who were waiting for me were
like, why'd she laugh that much?

1954
02:17:14,090 --> 02:17:16,510
What did you say to make her laugh?

1955
02:17:16,990 --> 02:17:18,610

02:22:56,140 --> 02:22:57,020
I'm late, by the way.

2063
02:22:57,460 --> 02:23:01,400
Either when I come back from Japan or in August.

2064
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:07,080
One or the other because I just don't want to be interrupted
when I'm like...

2065
02:23:07,100 --> 02:23:08,080
You know?

2066
02:23:09,360 --> 02:23:10,600
If I'm playing...

2067
02:23:10,600 --> 02:23:13,020
Actually, no, I think I can do it when I come back from
Japan.

2068
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:14,880
I think so.

2069
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:16,340
I think so.

2070
02:23:18,560 --> 02:23:19,440
A kindoo!

2071
02:23:19,580 --> 02:23:20,680
Thank you so much for the gift.

2072
02:23:20,900 --> 02:23:21,380
Thank you.

2073
02:23:22,140 --> 02:23:25,600
One of my friends is too embarrassed to ask you for a
birthday song, so ask for her!

2074
02:23:26,280 --> 02:23:28,140
Would you please wish...

2075
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:29,120
Skel...

2076
02:23:30,040 --> 02:23:30,480
Skelivan!

2077
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:31,000
Skelivan!

2078
02:23:31,260 --> 02:23:31,880
Happy birthday!

2079
02:23:32,480 --> 02:23:33,840
Of course I can!

2080
02:23:34,360 --> 02:23:34,800
Skelivan!

2081
02:23:35,540 --> 02:23:36,340
Happy birthday!

2082
02:23:38,180 --> 02:24:00,040
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday
dear Skelerman Happy birthday to you Happy birthday Having a

2083
02:24:00,040 --> 02:24:06,040
Zojirushi water boiler changed my life It's seriously if you
drink a lot of hot water stuff like tea or...

2084
02:24:07,100 --> 02:24:07,620
Oh my god.

2085
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,000
Thank you for the...

2086
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,300
Sorry, I'm leaning into the...

2087
02:24:11,300 --> 02:24:12,780
I'm leaning into the screen.

2088
02:24:12,860 --> 02:24:14,600
Thank you for the bread!

2089
02:24:15,300 --> 02:24:15,760
Kawaguchi!

2090
02:24:17,100 --> 02:24:17,800
Thank you!

2091
02:24:19,360 --> 02:24:25,800
Yeah, if you drink a lot of like tea or hot water, stuff
involving hot water, like if you make coffee, I use it when

2092
02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:26,720
I'm making coffee.

2093
02:24:27,320 --> 02:24:29,520
Like, it is so awesome.

2094
02:24:29,660 --> 02:24:31,600
Zoji-dushi water boiler.

2095
02:24:32,260 --> 02:24:33,140
It's so good.

2096
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:34,140
So good.

2097
02:24:34,820 --> 02:24:36,140
So, so handy.

2098
02:24:36,140 --> 02:24:39,100
And then it's also like, it just keeps warm all day.

2099
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:42,080
Ah, it's awesome.

2100
02:24:45,580 --> 02:24:46,060
Um.

2101
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:48,820
It's water fun.

2102
02:24:48,940 --> 02:24:49,520
Thank you.

2103
02:24:49,740 --> 02:24:51,060
I'm impressed by your pronunciation.

2104
02:24:51,440 --> 02:24:52,660
Almost no one gets my name right.

2105
02:24:53,960 --> 02:24:56,440
I thought it was like a Socrates, so I just, you know.

2106
02:24:57,760 --> 02:24:59,400
Looks like Streamlabs is behind.

2107
02:24:59,580 --> 02:25:00,700
I know they are.

2108
02:25:00,960 --> 02:25:03,620
They're coming through slowly, but surely.

2109
02:25:06,140 --> 02:25:08,620
I moved back out on my mom's list looking like it'll be a
while.

2110
02:25:09,080 --> 02:25:09,800
Might do it anyway.

2111
02:25:10,280 --> 02:25:13,600
When you had a roommate or parent while streaming, what
rules did you have?

2112
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:16,000
That's a good question.

2113
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:21,880
I never streamed when I lived with my parents.

2114
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:28,100
As soon as I could leave, I did.

2115
02:25:29,060 --> 02:25:30,300
Shinselaer, thanks for the fun.

2116
02:25:30,420 --> 02:25:30,960
Thank you.

2117
02:25:33,120 --> 02:25:44,520
But with my roommates even, I think because I streamed in my
closet and it was um on the other side of the uh of the of

2118
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:57,420
the house from my roommates they never really heard me so um
I didn't actually have any rules before even now though

2119
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:10,220
I think uh I think because they also like stream a little
bit um We kind of just, like, understand that this is just

2120
02:26:10,220 --> 02:26:10,840
how it is.

2121
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:21,160
So, the live jelly cam.

2122
02:26:22,340 --> 02:26:22,860
I know, right?

2123
02:26:23,220 --> 02:26:23,900
Isn't it awesome?

2124
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:24,860
Streamer house.

2125
02:26:25,220 --> 02:26:26,140
Streamer house real.

2126
02:26:27,020 --> 02:26:29,780
Is the MGS episode coming before or after MGS con?

2127
02:26:30,320 --> 02:26:32,840
I think I have it on the schedule for...

2128
02:26:32,840 --> 02:26:33,200
Let's see.

2129
02:26:34,840 --> 02:26:35,780
What do I say?

2130
02:26:37,860 --> 02:26:40,520
I have it on the schedule for...

2131
02:26:47,160 --> 02:26:48,000
After MGSCon.

2132
02:26:51,980 --> 02:26:53,000
My school had an earthquake.

2133
02:26:53,240 --> 02:26:54,820
Oh, I hope you're okay.

2134
02:26:55,940 --> 02:26:57,520
Stay safe, stay safe.

2135
02:26:58,560 --> 02:27:00,620
Here's a list of play first by order.

2136
02:27:00,860 --> 02:27:06,760
4-5-0 for story, but you can play Air Combat and Ace Combat
2 as your first game, too, despite them not having a story.

2137
02:27:06,980 --> 02:27:09,600
Skip 3 if you want since it's set in the future.

2138
02:27:09,820 --> 02:27:10,780
Oh, thank you, none!

2139
02:27:11,440 --> 02:27:12,320
4-5-0.

2140
02:27:12,420 --> 02:27:14,320
Wait, I've heard to play 0 first, though.

2141
02:27:28,480 --> 02:27:30,180
This combat 4 is so good.

2142
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:32,020
So much I want to play.

2143
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:33,980
When will MGS...

2144
02:27:33,980 --> 02:27:35,640
When will Metal Gear Delta come out?

2145
02:27:36,120 --> 02:27:39,300
When will Konami contact me about the dates for Metal Gear
Delta?

2146
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:45,120
Uh...

2147
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:45,460
Uh...

2148
02:27:46,480 --> 02:27:46,960
Uh...

2149
02:27:55,910 --> 02:27:56,290
Uh...

2150
02:27:56,290 --> 02:27:57,410
Elite Kaito!

2151
02:27:58,430 --> 02:27:59,030
Thanks for that, man.

2152
02:27:59,090 --> 02:27:59,670
Thank you.

2153
02:28:00,910 --> 02:28:02,750
I'd never play a Zero game first.

2154
02:28:02,850 --> 02:28:03,070
You know what?

2155
02:28:03,070 --> 02:28:03,630
That's fair.

2156
02:28:06,850 --> 02:28:17,730
fair the chance of playing Ace Combat 7 I would probably I
would like to play it I would like to actually I really want

2157
02:28:17,730 --> 02:28:25,010
to play that again I want to play Ace Combat 7 again and I
really want to play Metal Gear Rising again because I feel

2158
02:28:25,010 --> 02:28:33,350
like even though I've seen some stuff about like or rather
since Metal Gear Rising wasn't very long I can remember a

2159
02:28:33,350 --> 02:28:39,770
lot about it and kind of like like think back on some scenes
and be like oh now that i know the context for more stuff i

2160
02:28:39,770 --> 02:28:50,270

02:29:29,950 --> 02:29:45,090
yeah i don't know i still am trying to decide my i'm still
trying to decide my schedule for for the week still trying

2165
02:29:45,090 --> 02:29:51,030
to set my schedule for the week I don't know what I want to
do yet my brain is so

2166
02:29:54,570 --> 02:30:04,050
from this past weekend especially because I don't know I
sleep on a very specific pillow when I sleep at a hotel

2167
02:30:04,050 --> 02:30:12,150
pillow unless it's like the hotel pillows are just they're
like I don't know, my hotel, no, not my hotel.

2168
02:30:12,370 --> 02:30:16,190
My pillow is the perfect, I'm Goldilocks.

2169
02:30:16,370 --> 02:30:20,370
It's the perfect bit of hard and soft.

2170
02:30:21,230 --> 02:30:24,970
And the hotel pillows are either too hard or too soft.

2171
02:30:25,650 --> 02:30:28,930
So I'm just, gosh, it was so hard to sleep.

2172
02:30:30,630 --> 02:30:32,870
I also met Chica Anzaya at AWA last year.

2173
02:30:32,990 --> 02:30:34,550
She signed the back of my Chisato plushie.

2174
02:30:35,130 --> 02:30:35,650
Cute!

2175
02:30:36,030 --> 02:30:38,630
Her staff thought I wanted to sign on its pants too.

2176
02:30:39,330 --> 02:30:42,330
Hakina plushie, I had an ask why she got to wear boxers.

2177
02:30:42,690 --> 02:30:43,330
It's canon.

2178
02:30:43,510 --> 02:30:44,370
It is canon.

2179
02:30:46,170 --> 02:30:47,270
You're so right.

2180
02:30:49,650 --> 02:30:51,910
It doesn't hit the same when it's different.

2181
02:30:56,840 --> 02:30:58,080
The down ones are trash.

2182
02:30:58,280 --> 02:30:58,840
Down pillows?

2183
02:30:59,020 --> 02:31:01,340
Oh my gosh, they hurt my neck so bad.

2184
02:31:05,740 --> 02:31:08,240
Why are we still at the beach?

2185
02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:10,960
There's nothing here.

2186
02:31:12,700 --> 02:31:13,680
Let's see what else.

2187
02:31:14,180 --> 02:31:16,000
Let's go back to aviary cam.

2188
02:31:17,020 --> 02:31:18,220
Oh my god, look at them.

2189
02:31:21,020 --> 02:31:23,520
Oh my gosh, look at them.

2190
02:31:24,240 --> 02:31:25,560
Look at those little birds.

2191
02:31:27,460 --> 02:31:28,140
Walk.

2192
02:31:28,980 --> 02:31:29,280
Walk.

2193
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:33,720
Walk with your feet.

2194
02:31:36,100 --> 02:31:39,540
My Kamiyoshi minty locks and the three pillows.

2195
02:31:40,380 --> 02:31:42,500
Minty locks and the three pillows.

2196
02:31:44,180 --> 02:31:45,500
What kind of a pillow is it?

2197
02:31:45,980 --> 02:31:48,600
I think it's just like a memory foam or foam, kind of foam.

2198
02:31:49,140 --> 02:31:55,180
But it's like, has like one of those pillows that's like
indented in the certain parts.

2199
02:31:55,460 --> 02:31:58,740
And it makes you have a good support.

2200
02:32:04,990 --> 02:32:07,290
I need a, I need a nice hard pillow.

2201
02:32:10,210 --> 02:32:11,390
Are those sandpipers?

2202
02:32:12,970 --> 02:32:15,530
It says, oh my gosh, look at him go!

2203
02:32:17,750 --> 02:32:28,210
marvel at the long legs of our blackneck stilt or spot the
tiny western snowy plovers that blend into the sand I don't

2204
02:32:28,210 --> 02:32:34,370
know I don't think I've seen any of those I think they're
too busy blending in look for leg bands on our birds which

2205
02:32:34,370 --> 02:32:45,710
helps us identify them each bird has its own history most
came here injured and can't live in the wild they make firm

2206
02:32:45,710 --> 02:32:49,850
down pillows I don't think that's real.

2207
02:32:51,270 --> 02:32:52,890
Kelp Forest Cam is always refreshing.

2208
02:32:53,450 --> 02:32:53,910
I don't know!

2209
02:32:54,470 --> 02:32:57,450
That one like zooms like crazy.

2210
02:32:58,490 --> 02:33:00,070
That one is kind of insane.

2211
02:33:00,810 --> 02:33:01,750
That one is just like...

2212
02:33:02,510 --> 02:33:03,090
Enhance.

2213
02:33:07,350 --> 02:33:08,310
Over here.

2214
02:33:10,570 --> 02:33:11,750
It's dragging you everywhere.

2215
02:33:14,950 --> 02:33:16,490
Oh, look at that!

2216
02:33:17,750 --> 02:33:20,290
Oh, this looks like a nice area to live in.

2217
02:33:22,450 --> 02:33:24,470
I wish I were a bird.

2218
02:33:26,830 --> 02:33:27,730
Where's the kelp?

2219
02:33:27,870 --> 02:33:28,670
There we go.

2220
02:33:30,070 --> 02:33:31,470
Okay, you guys ready for whiplash?

2221
02:33:38,030 --> 02:33:40,070
I've been to this aquarium over a decade ago.

2222
02:33:40,190 --> 02:33:44,310
I don't remember much, but I remember Monterey Bay stinks
horribly.

2223
02:33:47,230 --> 02:33:49,530
Just the bay itself or the aquarium?

2224
02:33:50,950 --> 02:33:55,730
It's probably from all the bird shit everywhere.

2225
02:33:58,900 --> 02:34:00,860
Any zoo live cams?

2226
02:34:00,900 --> 02:34:02,160
I can check.

2227
02:34:03,120 --> 02:34:04,020
Let's see.

2228
02:34:07,900 --> 02:34:08,260
Wait!

2229
02:34:08,860 --> 02:34:09,760
Look at him!

2230
02:34:10,260 --> 02:34:12,600
He's spotted like a tiger!

2231
02:34:13,720 --> 02:34:14,660
Leopard seal!

2232
02:34:15,320 --> 02:34:16,100

2233
02:34:16,380 --> 02:34:16,980
Leopard shark!

2234
02:34:17,260 --> 02:34:17,460

There's fish.

2246
02:34:49,440 --> 02:34:51,620
How do they all co-exist?

2247
02:34:51,980 --> 02:34:52,640
Co-habitat.

Well, the algae.

2252
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:03,680
The algae is probably what's making it so stinky.

2253
02:35:12,720 --> 02:35:13,760
Stinky algae.

2254
02:35:14,980 --> 02:35:19,000
It all, like, gathers up and then is, like, gunky.

2255
02:35:22,160 --> 02:35:24,220
A leopard seal would be a real fine.

I love elephant seals.

2316
02:41:46,870 --> 02:41:57,890
It's so funny because male elephant seals and female
elephant seals are literally like video game characters you

He looks kind of happy.

2324
02:42:34,250 --> 02:42:36,270
He looks like he's got a little bit of a smile.

2325
02:42:38,290 --> 02:42:40,910
Okay, I'm going to show you something else really grotesque.

2326
02:42:41,710 --> 02:42:44,350
I'm going to make you wish that you've never seen it before.

2327
02:42:46,950 --> 02:42:49,830
I'm going to make you say, please, Minto, stop.

2328
02:42:50,030 --> 02:42:50,990

02:43:08,100 --> 02:43:09,780
Oh no, he's got two bottom teeth.

2334
02:43:10,500 --> 02:43:11,800
Looks like my grandpa actually.

2335
02:43:18,060 --> 02:43:19,820
I never saw an elephant seal.

2336
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:22,740
I saw a leopard seal and I saw...

2337
02:43:23,960 --> 02:43:25,140
Oh gosh, what are they called?

2338
02:43:25,240 --> 02:43:25,560
Hold on.

2339
02:43:25,640 --> 02:43:26,420
Types of seals.

2340
02:43:26,700 --> 02:43:27,500
I can't remember the name.

2341
02:43:27,940 --> 02:43:28,840
Types of seals.

2342
02:43:31,860 --> 02:43:33,060
Um... I saw...

2343
02:43:36,680 --> 02:43:42,200

That my nose could be as great as this, guys.

2350

2351
02:44:21,430 --> 02:44:22,150

2356
02:44:49,510 --> 02:44:52,090
You won't catch me without a nose.

2357
02:44:52,110 --> 02:44:53,310
any longer.

2358
02:44:53,490 --> 02:44:53,670
Oh!

2359
02:45:26,800 --> 02:45:28,040
Behold my nose.

2360
02:45:32,380 --> 02:45:35,020
It doesn't come off, no matter how much I shake it!

2361
02:45:38,400 --> 02:45:40,340
This is how I'm gonna look for the rest of my afterlife.

2362
02:45:41,700 --> 02:45:42,320
Thank you.

2363
02:45:44,120 --> 02:45:44,620
Thank you.

2364
02:45:45,360 --> 02:45:47,300
I hope you can't wait to see this picture every stream.

2365
02:45:49,100 --> 02:45:50,090
It's never going away.

2366
02:45:53,580 --> 02:45:54,200
This is every.

2367
02:45:54,400 --> 02:45:55,580
This is everything.

2368
02:45:56,700 --> 02:45:57,340
This is everything.

2369
02:46:00,260 --> 02:46:02,460
As I'm live in this kelp forest.

2370
02:46:06,970 --> 02:46:08,370
You still don't see it.

2371
02:46:08,590 --> 02:46:09,250
Oh, sorry.

2372
02:46:09,510 --> 02:46:09,790
Don't.

2373
02:46:17,300 --> 02:46:18,520
Does this help?

2374
02:46:42,550 --> 02:46:43,290
Who sent that?

2375
02:46:46,520 --> 02:46:47,480
What'd you say?

2376
02:46:48,440 --> 02:46:52,480
Minto China is my Saiko Ichiban, Japanese Ohime Sama.

2377
02:46:59,120 --> 02:46:59,740
Domo.

2378
02:47:02,440 --> 02:47:03,180
Bang her nose, mint.

2379
02:47:03,480 --> 02:47:03,810
Thank you.

2380
02:47:09,440 --> 02:47:10,680
That's the picture she chose.

2381
02:47:11,740 --> 02:47:12,460
Does the mouth open?

2382
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:15,020
Does that mean her nostrils are constantly flared up?

2383
02:47:17,880 --> 02:47:18,500
No!

2384
02:47:20,840 --> 02:47:21,460
Um.

2385
02:47:21,960 --> 02:47:23,240
I don't know what that means.

2386
02:47:24,100 --> 02:47:25,820
It means I might have a infection.

2387
02:47:26,500 --> 02:47:27,800
It looks honestly...

2388
02:47:28,900 --> 02:47:32,360
It means I might have an infection in my nose, I think.

2389
02:47:33,320 --> 02:47:33,880
Oof.

2390
02:47:34,800 --> 02:47:35,180
Oof.

2391
02:47:38,810 --> 02:47:42,110
The picture's worth a thousand words, yet zero nulls.

2392
02:47:43,830 --> 02:47:45,150
You can't say that, you guys.

2393
02:47:45,510 --> 02:47:45,530
Look.

2394
02:47:46,230 --> 02:47:47,850
It's literally right there.

2395
02:47:53,500 --> 02:47:54,280
My nose.

2396
02:47:56,040 --> 02:47:56,980

an elephant seal where all my elephant CLV tubers rise up

2402
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:38,640

want to see the longest noses I want to see noses that reach

2403
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:47,380
the ground I want to see noses that touch the ground and
drag all over picking up every scent that could ever smell

2404
02:49:47,380 --> 02:49:54,340
on the ground I want you to be always I want you to be able
to throw your nose over your shoulder.

2405
02:49:56,060 --> 02:49:58,520
Does your nose hang low?

2406
02:49:58,840 --> 02:50:00,280
Does it wobble to and fro?

2407
02:50:00,640 --> 02:50:02,120
Can you tie it in a knot?

2408
02:50:02,420 --> 02:50:04,040
Can you tie it in a bow?

2409
02:50:06,540 --> 02:50:12,520
Oh, this was a ploy to get you to show nose.

2410
02:50:12,840 --> 02:50:13,480
Now it's mine.

2411
02:50:13,680 --> 02:50:13,940
Yoink.

2412
02:50:15,300 --> 02:50:19,580
Have you guys ever seen that guy that like goes into the
Florida Everglades and he's just like, hey guys, I'm back in

2413
02:50:19,580 --> 02:50:23,840
the Florida Everglades and I'm walking around I'm looking
for a 20-foot Python.

2414
02:50:24,200 --> 02:50:25,260
Oh, there's a frog.

2415
02:50:25,580 --> 02:50:25,820
Yoink.

2416
02:50:27,080 --> 02:50:28,640
Love watching his videos.

2417
02:50:29,700 --> 02:50:32,300
Does that mean Mint is now open to accepting husband
requests?

2418
02:50:32,520 --> 02:50:33,000
Whoa, what?

2419
02:50:34,080 --> 02:50:34,320
Huh?

2420
02:50:35,300 --> 02:50:35,540
Huh?

2421
02:50:37,060 --> 02:50:37,300
Huh?

2422
02:50:38,800 --> 02:50:39,100
Huh?

2423
02:50:39,940 --> 02:50:41,960
Where did you get this idea from?

2424
02:50:45,780 --> 02:50:47,100
That guy is awesome.

2425
02:50:47,780 --> 02:50:48,620
I love that guy.

2426
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:50,240
A nose like Ayami's chest.

2427
02:50:50,400 --> 02:50:50,820
Exactly.

2428
02:50:56,020 --> 02:51:04,640
he just grabs everything he does if you don't know what i'm
talking about i'm not quite sure about his username but um

2429
02:51:04,640 --> 02:51:11,640
he's some guy he goes to the florida everglades and
sometimes uh he went somewhere else too before but he's

2430
02:51:11,640 --> 02:51:19,800
usually in the florida everglades and he just walks around
barefoot his feet are like covered in flies and every bug

2431
02:51:19,800 --> 02:51:23,360
imaginable And he's just like, I'm out here in the Florida
Everglades.

2432
02:51:23,540 --> 02:51:24,680
Oh, there's a swamp puppy.

2433
02:51:25,440 --> 02:51:28,980
And he looks at the swamp puppy and it's a gator or a
crocodile.

2434
02:51:30,140 --> 02:51:34,700
I think the swamp gators or swamp puppies are the gators and
crocodiles are.

2435
02:51:36,340 --> 02:51:37,640
He calls a crocodile.

2436
02:51:38,600 --> 02:51:40,920
Yeah, he yoyings frogs, lizards, snakes, and pet gator.

2437
02:51:41,040 --> 02:51:42,220
He yoyings anything.

2438
02:51:42,680 --> 02:51:45,560
He's just like, oh, there's a snake.

2439
02:51:46,020 --> 02:51:46,280
Yoying.

2440
02:51:47,160 --> 02:51:48,880
And like the snake will be like...

2441
02:51:50,820 --> 02:52:03,480
his on his arm and he's just like this guy's chowing down on
me it's so funny i think if you probably search florida

2442
02:52:03,480 --> 02:52:18,020
everglades yoink i'm i'm almost positive he'll come up
florida everglades yoink yoink i think i think you'll find

2443
02:52:18,020 --> 02:52:22,440
him now you're a seal Seals collect husbands.

2444
02:52:24,200 --> 02:52:25,300
But I'm the male seal.

2445
02:52:26,480 --> 02:52:27,380
I've got the trunk.

2446
02:52:30,540 --> 02:52:31,580
Can I collect wives?

2447
02:52:33,760 --> 02:52:36,440
Wait, the female seals collect husbands?

2448
02:52:37,340 --> 02:52:37,680
Wow.

2449
02:52:42,980 --> 02:52:43,480
You would think?

2450
02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:44,080
I don't know.

2451
02:52:45,640 --> 02:52:46,540
Seals seem to be...

2452
02:52:46,540 --> 02:52:48,600
They just look like they would be territorial.

2453
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:49,780
I don't know why.

2454
02:52:56,380 --> 02:52:57,820
The real Florida man.

2455
02:52:58,900 --> 02:53:16,300

You guys!

2496

I don't know why Utah has been so bad lately for me.

2497
02:56:15,180 --> 02:56:17,160
I hope it's not like this for anyone else.

There's a couple more.

2513
02:57:03,600 --> 02:57:05,780
It's because it has 200 plus trackers.

2514
02:57:06,040 --> 02:57:07,320
It loads for ages.

2515
02:57:07,900 --> 02:57:09,320
Or, sorry, 100 plus trackers.

2516
02:57:09,440 --> 02:57:09,940
What's that mean?

2517
02:57:10,060 --> 02:57:10,940
100 plus trackers.

2518
02:57:11,320 --> 02:57:12,680
Me and Rick, get it!

2519
02:57:12,680 --> 02:57:14,620

I mean, I'm a little spooky.

2525
02:57:28,060 --> 02:57:29,780
I have to be spooky.

2526
02:57:30,860 --> 02:57:31,620
I have to be.

2527
02:57:31,780 --> 02:57:32,740
I have to be spooky.

2528
02:57:33,400 --> 02:57:35,640
Someone asked about another zoo camp.

2530
02:57:36,200 --> 02:57:37,860

02:58:29,830 --> 02:58:30,970

03:00:33,180 --> 03:00:34,240
I think it's gone, gone.

2572
03:00:35,980 --> 03:00:37,500
Show me the red pandas.

2573
03:00:40,940 --> 03:00:42,040
Hold on one second.

2574
03:00:42,280 --> 03:00:43,960
Sorry, I gotta make it disappear again.

2575
03:00:44,080 --> 03:00:47,140
See what live cams they have here.

2576
03:00:48,120 --> 03:00:49,940
You guys.

2577
03:00:51,060 --> 03:00:52,340
Tiger cam.

2578
03:00:57,560 --> 03:00:58,380
Wow.

2579
03:01:06,800 --> 03:01:08,280
Baboon cam.

2580
03:01:10,700 --> 03:01:13,160
Are those the baboons right there?

2581
03:01:14,400 --> 03:01:15,160
I think so.

2582
03:01:17,120 --> 03:01:21,340
Oh my god.

2583
03:01:23,160 --> 03:01:26,500
There's someone in the chat that is really upset about this.

2584
03:01:27,180 --> 03:01:28,160
Let me show you guys.

2585
03:01:30,280 --> 03:01:31,540
Look at the live chat.

2586
03:01:34,540 --> 03:01:35,080
No monkey.

2587
03:01:35,220 --> 03:01:35,840
No monkey.

2588
03:01:36,120 --> 03:01:36,800
No monkey.

2589
03:01:42,100 --> 03:01:43,100
No monkey.

2590
03:01:43,760 --> 03:01:44,160
No monkey.

2591
03:01:44,160 --> 03:01:44,500
No monkey.

2592
03:01:48,340 --> 03:01:49,740
Oh my gosh.

2593
03:01:50,440 --> 03:01:52,360
They should not go to the tiger cam.

2594
03:01:52,580 --> 03:01:52,960
Oh my gosh.

2595
03:01:52,980 --> 03:01:54,580
They're going to lose their minds.

2596
03:01:54,980 --> 03:01:56,160
There's monkeys here.

2597
03:02:01,880 --> 03:02:03,640
Monkey in the bottom right.

2598
03:02:05,280 --> 03:02:05,520
Hold on.

2599
03:02:05,780 --> 03:02:06,880
I can entertain them.

2600
03:02:07,780 --> 03:02:08,060
Mute time.

2601
03:02:08,260 --> 03:02:09,080
Come to my stream.

2602
03:02:19,260 --> 03:02:20,220
Somebody help.

2603
03:02:20,780 --> 03:02:24,160
I've fallen in the monkey pit and I can't get out.

2604
03:02:25,180 --> 03:02:25,560
Oh my god.

2605
03:02:25,680 --> 03:02:26,260
I've lost all...

2606
03:02:26,260 --> 03:02:27,680
There's a bird next to me.

2607
03:02:28,020 --> 03:02:28,620
Oh my god.

2608
03:02:28,980 --> 03:02:30,760
I've lost all use of my legs.

2609
03:02:31,580 --> 03:02:34,420
Please, somebody help me out of the monkey cage.

2610
03:02:35,220 --> 03:02:38,360
Oh my god, I'm just a baby in the monkey cage, please.

2611
03:02:40,460 --> 03:02:42,160
Oh my god, oh my god.

2612
03:02:42,340 --> 03:02:45,080
I'm just, oh my god, I hope no monkeys come down here.

2613
03:02:45,880 --> 03:02:47,860
Oh no, oh my god.

2614
03:02:49,500 --> 03:02:54,160
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just in the, I'm a ghost in the
monkey.

2615
03:02:54,240 --> 03:02:55,480
What is that on the ground?

2616
03:02:56,780 --> 03:02:58,440
What is that right next to me?

2617
03:03:00,780 --> 03:03:01,240
a bird?

2618
03:03:02,060 --> 03:03:02,740
Is it a monkey?

2619
03:03:03,640 --> 03:03:04,260
I don't know.

2620
03:03:04,920 --> 03:03:07,180
The baboons don't want to do anything, though.

2621
03:03:08,280 --> 03:03:08,920
Mint, no!

2622
03:03:09,140 --> 03:03:10,320
It's happening again.

2623
03:03:11,080 --> 03:03:14,200
The baby's love dropped in the monkey cage!

2624
03:03:17,240 --> 03:03:19,700
They're going to let these balloons escape.

2625
03:03:20,560 --> 03:03:21,160
Handle it.

2626
03:03:26,770 --> 03:03:27,170
Okay.

2627
03:03:28,430 --> 03:03:29,670
I thought I could tempt them.

2628
03:03:32,470 --> 03:03:33,570
I thought I could tempt... Whoa.

2629
03:03:33,690 --> 03:03:38,490
Oh my god, I'm break dancing in the monkey cage!

2630
03:03:39,890 --> 03:03:43,590
Oh my god, I can't stop break dancing in the monkey cage!

2631
03:03:44,370 --> 03:03:48,670
Oh my god, please somebody, I just can't stop break dancing
in the monkey cage!

2632
03:03:49,970 --> 03:03:52,450
Oh my god, oh my god!

2633
03:03:53,030 --> 03:03:55,950
This is not good, this is not good.

2634
03:03:56,410 --> 03:03:58,410
Don't laugh, other way!

2635
03:04:07,550 --> 03:04:07,980
I...

2636
03:04:08,410 --> 03:04:08,950
Whoa!

2637
03:04:10,270 --> 03:04:10,830
My bad.

2638
03:04:11,070 --> 03:04:11,230
Okay.

2639
03:04:12,150 --> 03:04:12,810
I think we're good.

2640
03:04:15,990 --> 03:04:16,850
Okay.

2641
03:04:18,010 --> 03:04:18,410
Okay.

2642
03:04:19,090 --> 03:04:19,230
I

2643
03:04:27,510 --> 03:04:30,010
don't think these guys are gonna do anything.

2644
03:04:31,950 --> 03:04:35,430
Let's go to the live ape cam.

2645
03:04:38,630 --> 03:04:41,810
This is the experience I wanted.

2646
03:04:42,410 --> 03:04:43,270
No highlights.

2647
03:04:44,030 --> 03:04:44,990
Full disappointment.

2648
03:04:44,990 --> 03:04:54,730
I do want to go to the live cam and say there's nothing here
nothing here no monkey no monkey no monkey no monkey no

2649
03:04:54,730 --> 03:05:03,930
monkey no monkey no monkey no monkey no monkey no monkey no
monkey no monkey no monkey no monkey no monkey no monkey no

2650
03:05:03,930 --> 03:05:25,750

monkey monkey these ones streamed a year ago these ones are

2651
03:05:25,750 --> 03:05:38,870
from a long time ago we could go into the past and see the
monkeys of the past giraffe cam oh my Wow!

2652
03:05:43,170 --> 03:05:44,850
Look at the birds walking!

2653
03:05:47,930 --> 03:05:49,050
Oh my god.

2654
03:05:49,770 --> 03:05:50,670
The bison.

2655
03:05:50,910 --> 03:05:52,250
Those are not bison.

2656
03:05:52,430 --> 03:05:53,090
What are these called?

2657
03:05:53,270 --> 03:05:53,770
I don't remember.

2658
03:05:54,310 --> 03:06:01,950
Haven't seen the new planet of the apes yet, but now I can't
help but imagine mint break dancing in the middle of it.

2659
03:06:03,730 --> 03:06:05,350
Where are the giraffes?

2660
03:06:05,770 --> 03:06:06,910
Okay, I'm gonna skip forward.

2661
03:06:11,640 --> 03:06:12,120
Giraffes?

2662
03:06:13,540 --> 03:06:14,020
Giraffes?

2663
03:06:15,340 --> 03:06:17,340
There's a comet, the live chat.

2664
03:06:17,880 --> 03:06:19,420
It just says, why are they standing?

2665
03:06:20,820 --> 03:06:21,640
I don't know.

2666
03:06:23,820 --> 03:06:25,780
Also, why are they frozen in time?

2667
03:06:27,100 --> 03:06:28,060
Maybe that's what he meant.

2668
03:06:28,780 --> 03:06:30,060
Why are they frozen in time?

2669
03:06:32,460 --> 03:06:33,640
Why are they standing?

2670
03:06:43,870 --> 03:06:44,350
Gizels?

2671
03:06:44,490 --> 03:06:45,370
Is that what those are.

2672
03:06:50,850 --> 03:06:50,890
Rhino?

2673
03:06:51,150 --> 03:06:52,230
I didn't see any rhino.

2674
03:06:53,070 --> 03:06:54,690
Maybe I wasn't looking for them.

2675
03:06:56,350 --> 03:06:58,370
No monkey, no monkey, no monkey.

2676
03:06:59,510 --> 03:07:01,090
No monkey, no monkey, no monkey.

2677
03:07:01,410 --> 03:07:01,870
No tiger.

2678
03:07:02,450 --> 03:07:03,410
No nothing.

2679
03:07:04,890 --> 03:07:06,090
San Diego Zoo.

2680
03:07:07,050 --> 03:07:08,230
What's going on?

2681
03:07:09,550 --> 03:07:11,350
Oh, my goodness.

2682
03:07:11,610 --> 03:07:13,210
A little guy asleep.

2683
03:07:14,610 --> 03:07:15,550
A little guy asleep.

2684
03:07:15,790 --> 03:07:17,790
Why are they standing there menacingly?

2685
03:07:19,490 --> 03:07:20,850
Pizza mozzarella.

2686
03:07:21,470 --> 03:07:21,930
Welcome to membership.

2687
03:07:22,310 --> 03:07:22,790
Thank you.

2688
03:07:23,890 --> 03:07:24,590
Red Panda.

2689
03:07:25,590 --> 03:07:28,890
We're watching Red Panda at 2 frames per second.

2690
03:07:29,890 --> 03:07:30,490
I love it.

2691
03:07:33,110 --> 03:07:33,790
144p.

2692
03:07:34,030 --> 03:07:34,270
Let's go.

2693
03:07:34,610 --> 03:07:34,850
Let's see.

2694
03:07:34,970 --> 03:07:35,310
What is it?

2695
03:07:35,810 --> 03:07:35,810
Actually.

2696
03:07:37,090 --> 03:07:38,390
It's 480p.

2697
03:07:38,570 --> 03:07:39,330
Thank you very much.

2698
03:07:42,630 --> 03:07:44,030
Stop motion panda.

2699
03:07:45,490 --> 03:07:46,990
It kind of hurts my eyes.

2700
03:07:50,010 --> 03:07:53,550

2702
03:08:21,620 --> 03:08:24,360
can we see fuji-san today please Please!

2703
03:08:28,300 --> 03:08:30,780
Um, I guess we can't see Fujisan today.

2704
03:08:31,360 --> 03:08:33,360
I thought I could reload it.

2705
03:08:34,240 --> 03:08:35,000
Ah.

2706
03:08:37,240 --> 03:08:40,340
No Fujisan today, unfortunately.

2707
03:08:41,880 --> 03:08:44,120
Let's see, if we go back to like when this...

2708
03:08:44,120 --> 03:08:44,480
Would it...

2709
03:08:45,700 --> 03:08:46,460
Oh!

2710
03:08:47,140 --> 03:08:48,800
This morning!

2711
03:08:50,620 --> 03:08:52,360
Oh my god!

2712
03:08:53,260 --> 03:08:54,020
Wow!

2713
03:08:54,120 --> 03:08:57,700
Wow, it was so beautiful.

2714
03:08:58,420 --> 03:09:00,980
Fujisan a couple hours ago.

2715
03:09:01,940 --> 03:09:04,800
Fujisan at the break of dawn.

2716
03:09:10,510 --> 03:09:11,270
Come on.

2717
03:09:13,190 --> 03:09:14,150
Come on.

2718
03:09:18,520 --> 03:09:19,720
It's a little broken.

2719
03:09:20,780 --> 03:09:22,040
It's a little broken, that's okay.

2720
03:09:24,480 --> 03:09:25,520
That's okay.

2721
03:09:29,300 --> 03:09:30,140
There we go.

2722
03:09:34,200 --> 03:09:37,820
This is my favorite Fujisan cam to watch.

2723
03:09:39,140 --> 03:09:40,880
There's also another one that I really like, too.

2724
03:09:41,780 --> 03:09:44,120
But I feel like this one gets the best...

2725
03:09:44,120 --> 03:09:44,940
What's the word?

2726
03:09:46,600 --> 03:09:47,400
The best...

2727
03:09:47,400 --> 03:09:48,100
Good visual?

2728
03:09:48,320 --> 03:09:48,900
Good idea?

2729
03:09:49,200 --> 03:09:49,960
If it's...

2730
03:09:51,940 --> 03:09:53,480
If it's viewable?

2731
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:55,720
I don't see the other one, actually.

2732
03:09:57,040 --> 03:09:57,920
It's not that one.

2733
03:09:58,020 --> 03:09:59,400
It's one from a street.

2734
03:10:00,120 --> 03:10:00,580
From a highway.

2735
03:10:00,680 --> 03:10:01,840
I also like looking at this one, too.

2736
03:10:02,580 --> 03:10:02,980
Wow!

2737
03:10:05,400 --> 03:10:06,780
Oh my god.

2738
03:10:09,700 --> 03:10:13,700
I actually have a recording from this one because it was so
pretty one morning.

2739
03:10:14,620 --> 03:10:15,600
I'm gonna cry.

2740
03:10:16,760 --> 03:10:17,680
Yeah, best perspective.

2741
03:10:18,160 --> 03:10:21,080
There's another one though that's from the road that I
really like a lot too.

2742
03:10:21,340 --> 03:10:25,100
Like it's from, you can see a highway and you can see kind
of the lakes and everything too.

2743
03:10:25,540 --> 03:10:26,540
So it's really nice.

2744
03:10:26,900 --> 03:10:28,520
This one's so nice too though.

2745
03:10:30,160 --> 03:10:32,780
Wow, all these normies out taking pictures.

2746
03:10:33,280 --> 03:10:34,260
Look at all the couples.

2747
03:10:34,580 --> 03:10:35,240
Holy cow.

2748
03:10:36,480 --> 03:10:39,460
Couple, couple, maybe couple, couple.

2749
03:10:40,620 --> 03:10:41,000
Wow.

2750
03:10:44,080 --> 03:10:45,180
Oh yeah, wait.

2751
03:10:46,160 --> 03:10:46,840
They're getting a picture?

2752
03:10:47,140 --> 03:10:47,860
I don't know.

2753
03:10:49,840 --> 03:10:50,640
Gross couples.

2754
03:10:51,300 --> 03:10:52,800
This is why this one's not so great.

2755
03:10:53,420 --> 03:10:55,100
But if you go back in time when there's nobody,

2756
03:11:00,370 --> 03:11:00,770
load.

2757
03:11:06,800 --> 03:11:09,080
YouTube is giving me such trouble all the time.

2758
03:11:10,220 --> 03:11:11,060
I wasn't recording.

2759
03:11:11,180 --> 03:11:12,500
It looks like it came from the 90s.

2760
03:11:12,540 --> 03:11:13,100
That's true.

2761
03:11:13,300 --> 03:11:21,380
does look like it can the quality on it is so bad it says
wow there's a 4k no way

2762
03:11:24,600 --> 03:11:35,620
no way this is for this is it in 4k this is it this is fuji
sign in 4k

2763
03:11:44,020 --> 03:11:50,740
oh it doesn't even load oh my goodness doesn't even load
Anyway.

2764
03:11:52,080 --> 03:11:56,320
Well, we kind of saw Fujisan today, so that's a win in my
book.

2765
03:11:57,980 --> 03:12:01,280
That is a win in my book, baby.

2766
03:12:03,920 --> 03:12:04,900
Give me a second.

2767
03:12:06,320 --> 03:12:07,100
Is broken.

2768
03:12:07,380 --> 03:12:08,100
It is broken.

2769
03:12:10,100 --> 03:12:15,180
Would you do an MGA Zatsu with other indie VTubers or some
who are possibly talking about doing it?

2770
03:12:15,520 --> 03:12:19,120
Oh yeah, I would totally, I've thought about doing something
like that before actually.

2771
03:12:20,340 --> 03:12:22,300
Yeah, I'd totally be down for it.

2772
03:12:24,640 --> 03:12:26,560
Oh, where am I?

2773
03:12:26,840 --> 03:12:27,220
Oh, here.

2774
03:12:28,720 --> 03:12:29,480
My bad.

2778
03:12:40,100 --> 03:12:41,160

03:12:44,340 --> 03:12:45,840

2811
03:14:59,420 --> 03:15:02,080
But if it's too big, wouldn't it be difficult to travel

2812
03:15:03,680 --> 03:15:04,020
Hmm.

Ah, thank you.

2827
03:15:57,180 --> 03:15:59,880
Nothing better than a chill stream with you after a tough
Monday at work.

2828
03:16:03,300 --> 03:16:04,240
Yeah, yeah.

2829
03:16:05,920 --> 03:16:06,640
Can't wait to meet you out.

2830
03:16:06,660 --> 03:16:07,400

2831
03:16:07,520 --> 03:16:09,060
I also hope you had fun today.

2832
03:16:09,680 --> 03:16:10,560
Thank you!

2833
03:16:13,800 --> 03:16:15,040
They want to fight.

2834
03:16:15,980 --> 03:16:17,580
Fight, fight, fight, fight.

2835
03:16:17,660 --> 03:16:19,720
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.

2836
03:16:19,940 --> 03:16:22,160
Oh my gosh, fight in my meet and greet.

2837
03:16:22,880 --> 03:16:24,000
Fight in my meet and greet.

2838
03:16:25,140 --> 03:16:27,960
I don't know how this actually works, to be honest.

2839
03:16:28,840 --> 03:16:31,900
I don't know if everybody needs a meet and greet ticket.

2840
03:16:32,820 --> 03:16:34,820
But it did say that groups were allowed.

2841
03:16:36,340 --> 03:16:37,740
So, I'm not sure.

2842
03:16:37,860 --> 03:16:41,280
You might want to ask Off-Kai staff.

2843
03:16:42,720 --> 03:16:44,920
I don't know if one person needs a meet and greet ticket.

2844
03:16:46,220 --> 03:16:49,740
and they need the tickets, yeah?

2845
03:16:50,740 --> 03:16:54,680
Because I was like, if you have one person has a meet and
greet ticket and everybody just goes in together, then

2846
03:16:57,940 --> 03:16:58,720
you know?

2847
03:17:01,500 --> 03:17:07,440
But I just assume it means multiple ticket people can go in
at once.

2848
03:17:11,300 --> 03:17:11,700
Okay.

2849
03:17:13,820 --> 03:17:14,840
Well, that's all it.

2850
03:17:14,920 --> 03:17:18,640
Instead of a meet and greet, let's have a meet and fight.

2851
03:17:20,160 --> 03:17:21,380
Oh my god, M and F.

2852
03:17:23,660 --> 03:17:25,260
It's just like that game series.

2853
03:17:25,400 --> 03:17:26,340
I played as a child.

2854
03:17:27,880 --> 03:17:28,580
Meet and fight.

2855
03:17:29,200 --> 03:17:29,460
Okay.

2856
03:17:31,980 --> 03:17:33,240
Let's have a meet and fight.

2857
03:17:33,460 --> 03:17:34,060
Meet and beat?

2858
03:17:34,680 --> 03:17:35,140
Oh, wait.

2859
03:17:35,780 --> 03:17:40,520
Oh, we're workshopping the name a little bit.

2860
03:17:44,330 --> 03:17:46,170
Let's workshop the name a little bit.

2861
03:17:49,910 --> 03:17:55,670
Please do not come to Mintos expecting a meat and beef,
please.

2862
03:18:02,620 --> 03:18:03,480
Oh, wait.

2863
03:18:04,300 --> 03:18:05,400
I can do this right now.

2864
03:18:05,540 --> 03:18:05,980
I can do.

2865
03:18:06,460 --> 03:18:06,900
I can do.

2866
03:18:07,100 --> 03:18:07,420
I can do.

2867
03:18:08,260 --> 03:18:08,840
I can do.

2868
03:18:08,980 --> 03:18:09,280
I can do.

2869
03:18:09,460 --> 03:18:09,820
I can do.

2870
03:18:20,080 --> 03:18:21,520
What am I looking for?

2871
03:18:21,940 --> 03:18:22,040
Oh.

2872
03:18:24,400 --> 03:18:24,840
Here.

2873
03:18:25,880 --> 03:18:28,180
You guys know what time it is.

2874
03:18:28,880 --> 03:18:31,360
It's the end of the stream time.

2875
03:18:36,560 --> 03:18:37,720
Oh, oh, oh.

2876
03:18:38,060 --> 03:18:38,840
The sound is off.

2877
03:18:43,780 --> 03:18:45,900
Yeah, baby.

2878
03:18:47,100 --> 03:18:48,080
Yeah, baby.

2879
03:18:49,940 --> 03:18:51,220
There it.

2880
03:18:53,720 --> 03:18:54,560
Bad up.

2881
03:18:58,040 --> 03:18:59,320
Something strange.

2882
03:19:00,060 --> 03:19:01,100
Sleeping in your bed.

2883
03:19:01,760 --> 03:19:02,380
Oh, my gosh.

2884
03:19:02,440 --> 03:19:03,320
I want to go to sleep.

2885
03:19:03,420 --> 03:19:04,980
Let me tell you something.

2886
03:19:06,100 --> 03:19:09,780
If there's something weird, sleeping in your bed.

2887
03:19:10,080 --> 03:19:10,260
Ow!

2888
03:19:10,700 --> 03:19:11,880
Let me tell you something.

2889
03:19:12,880 --> 03:19:15,420
Bustin makes me feel good.

2890
03:19:18,760 --> 03:19:25,680
Bustin, bustin, bustin, bustin, bustin, bustin, bustin,

2892
03:19:40,180 --> 03:19:43,080
Seeing things, sleeping in your bed.

03:19:46,200 --> 03:19:48,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2894
03:19:48,120 --> 03:19:51,240
An invisible man, sleeping in your bed.

2895
03:19:52,760 --> 03:19:54,020
Let me tell you something.

2896
03:19:55,500 --> 03:19:56,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2897
03:19:58,140 --> 03:20:02,480

2898
03:20:03,260 --> 03:20:04,720
Bus stand, bus stand.

2899
03:20:04,720 --> 03:20:05,960
Makes me feel good.

2900
03:20:06,100 --> 03:20:06,820
Feel good.

2901
03:20:07,120 --> 03:20:07,940
Feel good.

2902
03:20:08,180 --> 03:20:08,940
Feel good.

2903
03:20:09,220 --> 03:20:09,880
Feel good.

2904
03:20:09,980 --> 03:20:11,980
Feel good

2905
03:20:42,280 --> 03:20:42,900
Baby!

2906
03:20:45,380 --> 03:20:45,700
Ow!

2907
03:20:46,120 --> 03:20:46,140
Ow!

2908
03:20:46,740 --> 03:20:50,560
If you're all alone, let me sleep in your bed.

2909
03:20:52,120 --> 03:20:52,380
Shoo!

2910
03:20:54,100 --> 03:20:54,480
Shoo!

2911
03:20:55,300 --> 03:20:56,320
Let me tell you something.

2912
03:20:57,280 --> 03:20:59,440
Sleeping makes me feel good!

2913
03:21:03,640 --> 03:21:05,060
I'm afraid no sleep.

2914
03:21:05,760 --> 03:21:07,080
I'm afraid no bed.

2915
03:21:08,060 --> 03:21:10,920
Except the ones in the hotels because they might have bed
bugs.

2916
03:21:11,860 --> 03:21:13,020
An invisible bed!

2917
03:21:14,220 --> 03:21:16,300
Freaky ghost bed!

2918
03:21:16,340 --> 03:21:20,620
