1
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,020
Welcome back!

2
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,020
Hello everybody.

3
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,500
Welcome, welcome, welcome in.

4
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,200
Welcome in.

5
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,960
Welcome in!

6
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,510
Devil may cry.

7
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,750
Minto may cry.

8
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,870
Minto never cry.

9
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,450
Wisp always cry.

10
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,720
Welcome, welcome back.

11
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,100
Oh, she is hungry this time.

12
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,480
Stop it!

13
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,980
Stop with the hungry.

14
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,620
If I get hungry, I have spaghetti.

15
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,620
I can eat.

16
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:57,730
After talking about Ace Combat, I dragged a lot of attention from the Ace Combat community to your stream.

17
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,550
So say hi.

18
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,410
Hello!

19
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,670
Bow bow time.

20
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,430
It is bow bow time.

21
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,750
Oh gosh.

22
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,210
So I want to say...

23
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,130
Last time, I'm so sorry about before.

24
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,890
I'm feeling much better today.

25
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,390
Will I be any better at the game?

26
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,670
Probably not.

27
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,810
But that's okay.

28
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,670
You know, we...

29
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,830
I'm not alive, but humans live and learn.

30
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,890
I'm dead and I learn sometimes.

31
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,610
I never learn.

32
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,110
I never cry and I never learn.

33
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,690
Minto, it's my birthday.

34
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:52,450
How am I supposed to say your birthday if your name is anonymous?

35
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,990
That's so silly.

36
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,970
Exist and never learn.

37
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,390
You were kicking ass.

38
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,570
Caught up on the last bot today.

39
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,230
Stay stylish.

40
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:01,970
Thank you!

41
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,230
Thanks Pyrobot!

42
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,330
Pro tip for beating this boss.

43
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,370
Hit it till it dies.

44
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,030
Happy birthday to you!

45
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,170
Happy birthday!

46
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,510
Mysterious benefactor.

47
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,610
I remember I can switch...

48
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,430
Trickster?

49
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,450
Trickster is the...

50
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,490
Hold on.

51
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,510
This is melee.

52
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,230
This is special trick.

53
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,470
Or special move.

54
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,470
So for this it's like...

55
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,910
Do this in the air, right?

56
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,890
I remember.

57
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,550
I remember.

58
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:50,990
I remember.

59
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,450
I remember.

60
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,370
I remember.

61
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:53,770
I remember.

62
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:54,950
Hi Minky.

63
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:55,570
Hi!

64
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,010
Minto is dead.

65
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,970
Stuck in her waist.

66
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,110
That's a nice slapper right there.

67
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:06,970
I remember.

68
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,610
I forgot which style switch was in this one.

69
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,630
Royal Guard, Sword Master, Trickster, Gunslinger.

70
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:20,790
What?

71
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,470
What are my guns?

72
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,250
These are my guns.

73
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,470
Hold on.

74
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,910
How do I...

75
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,130
This is taunt.

76
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,810
How do I get to the menu?

77
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,510
This is lock on.

78
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,190
Trick, gun, sword, royal.

79
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,350
Gun, sword, gun, trick, gun, royal, gun, whatever, gun...

80
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,570
How... What was it to change my weapon?

81
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,270
Guys, I don't remember how to get to the... RT?

82
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:01,730
No?

83
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,230
LT?

84
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,070
Ah!

85
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,050
Here, here!

86
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,310
LT, LT, LT.

87
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,610
I think I might go to...

88
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,190
Ebony and Ivory for Cerberus.

89
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,770
Our frozen pup.

90
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,150
Our frozen pup dog.

91
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,390
Good luck against Cerberus and beyond.

92
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,310
I'm really happy you're enjoying this wacky woohoo pizza man game.

93
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,390
Do you think you would ever karaoke some of the songs at some point?

94
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,650
I liked what I heard last time during the boss battle.

95
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,980
I do want to say, I do want to reiterate.

96
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,340
If I'm bad at the game, I'm really sorry.

97
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,680
If I mess up and you're trying to yell at me in chat, I'm playing the game.

98
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,680
So if I see your message...

99
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,580
I'm gaming.

100
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,720
I can't read chat all the time.

101
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,000
So, try not to backseat so much.

102
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,780
And if I get something wrong, don't be like, I told you so!

103
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,000
VTuber!

104
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,460
VTuber never read.

105
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,700
Devil never cry.

106
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,100
VTuber never read.

107
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:17,640
Fun fact, this game was originally supposed to be RE6.

108
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,640
But Capcom thought Albert Wesker... Albert?

109
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,580
Was too silly so he became Virgil.

110
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,460
I can't tell if any of these are real anymore.

111
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,320
I wore my Minto shirt for good luck on my finals yesterday but I felt dumber.

112
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:32,920
No!

113
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,430
VTuber, why aren't you good at the game?

114
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,190
First time you play?

115
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:40,870
Exactly!

116
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,250
Gosh!

117
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,210
Oh my god.

118
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,050
But no, I'm very excited to be back at this.

119
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:51,250
Honestly, as much as sometimes difficult games frustrate me...

120
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,530
It's always on the path to becoming a better gamer.

121
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:03,650
I use the frustration and my stubbornness to not give up and to get better.

122
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,510
That's why I had easy mode unlock last stream and I didn't use it.

123
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,310
Because we're on the path.

124
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,070
This is the Minto path of becoming a stronger gamer.

125
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:23,430
We let our poor decisions and my panic... Oh my gosh, I feel like...

126
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,390
Wasn't it last time I was so close to beating Cerberus?

127
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,150
And then I panicked.

128
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,250
That's okay.

129
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,390
The Minky way.

130
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,130
Yeah!

131
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,590
Backseaters may cry.

132
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,510
Let them cry.

133
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,390
This game is known for being very hard.

134
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,850
I think people were saying no.

135
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,790
It's very hard.

136
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:51,710
It's very hard because the original only let you choose one way of playing, right?

137
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,010
And then the freestyle kind of, quote unquote, broke the game.

138
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,950
But I still feel that the enemies are kind of difficult.

139
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,710
Could only switch at statues, right.

140
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,230
But it's also just very hard.

141
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,670
The combat system goes hard.

142
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,430
And Cerberus is the hardest?

143
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,290
No, no, no.

144
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,130
I don't believe that.

145
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,570
Don't make me feel hope that I can get through this game.

146
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,490
Cerberus is the big speed bump.

147
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,950
Get past it and you get the hang of it.

148
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,630
It's like, actually filters people.

149
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,830
Cerberus is the real filter.

150
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,630
Oh my gosh, I can't imagine how many kids were playing this game like...

151
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,530
Mom!

152
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,730
Mom, I'll never make it as a gamer!

153
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,610
Mom!

154
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,250
Okay, I'm just kind of getting a feel of the controls again.

155
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,310
Whoa!

156
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,150
Am I in gun mode?

157
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,470
Was that... Holy moly!

158
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,830
I don't think that really helps us here though, so...

159
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,470
I will remember it, hopefully.

160
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,050
Well, you know, I'd like to just jump around, so...

161
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,470
I probably, you know...

162
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,130
Corporate weebs may cry, year end 2024.

163
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,590
Oh no, year end?

164
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:11,890
Ganbare!

165
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,970
Final mission, boss is hardest in series.

166
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,050
But you got it, Mito.

167
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,510
Thank you!

168
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,330
Hardest in the series?

169
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,330
Oh gosh...

170
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,950
Well, I'm not gonna think about that.

171
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,370
That's for... future Mito.

172
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,330
Oh, I was saying earlier...

173
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,330
I was so...

174
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,030
Last time...

175
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,370
Last stream was...

176
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:40,570
I...

177
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,690
I didn't even turn off my Switch, I didn't close the game or anything.

178
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,410
Like I...

179
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,010
I started up my Switch earlier and I was like...

180
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,210
We're still in the same spot!

181
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,170
So...

182
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,130
Thank you Switch-kun for being such a sport.

183
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,290
I don't know why I wouldn't show my name.

184
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,630
It's me, Aimee Nguyen.

185
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,930
Thanks for your birthday song.

186
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,470
Aimee!

187
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,390
That's so weird.

188
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:10,770
Aimee...

189
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:11,630
Aimee...

190
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,250
Aimee...

191
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,870
Aimee Mamamoose.

192
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,450
Aimee Mamamoose.

193
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,950
Okay, I'll give you another song.

194
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,290
Happy birthday to you.

195
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,250
Happy birthday to you.

196
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:30,130
Happy birthday dear Aimee.

197
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,570
Happy birthday to you.

198
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:37,970
Happy birthday!

199
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:39,650
There we go.

200
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,310
Aimee Mamamoose.

201
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:42,990
Okay.

202
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,950
I'm sipping my tea.

203
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:48,730
Today...

204
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,010
I was gonna say... Hold on.

205
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,950
I was... I don't know how long I'll go today.

206
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,010
I actually still have to pack and...

207
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,170
And stuff.

208
00:12:59,170 --> 00:12:59,770
So...

209
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,710
You know, we'll see.

210
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,810
We'll see how far we get.

211
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,370
Oh gosh, Ice Guardian's chamber.

212
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,790
One hour stream.

213
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,270
No!

214
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,130
Longer.

215
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,130
I think I can go longer.

216
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,610
90 second stream.

217
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,210
What if Cerberus first try?

218
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,050
Imagine.

219
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,310
If I'm like, I'll end the stream after I beat Cerberus.

220
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:30,710
First try.

221
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,410
Goodbye everybody.

222
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,310
We'll watch it again.

223
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:49,250
Yeah.

224
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:57,250
I love how sassy he is now.

225
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:57,790
Again.

226
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,910
He's so young!

227
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,280
He's a young'un.

228
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,040
He looks like... so young.

229
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,100
Wait, hold on.

230
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,160
Hold on.

231
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,360
I'm doing audio balancing.

232
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,080
Should be fine.

233
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,260
If it gets too loud, I'll try and...

234
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,340
I'll try and adjust while mid-battle.

235
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,040
Okay.

236
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,240
Oh, this one.

237
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,580
Oh, okay.

238
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,100
I forgot.

239
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,380
I'm not hitting them at all.

240
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,720
I'm not doing anything at all.

241
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,980
Here we go.

242
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,000
I can't say anything.

243
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,530
Wait, how do I?

244
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,310
Oh gosh.

245
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,790
Okay, Trickster has like the fast dodge.

246
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,610
Okay, I'm remembering.

247
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,610
It's coming back to me.

248
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,890
It's coming back to me.

249
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,190
Crazy!

250
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,470
Oh my gosh.

251
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,450
Oh, that got me.

252
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,270
Big, big, big, big damage.

253
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,210
Back, back, back!

254
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,470
Okay.

255
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,750
How do I get to the menu?

256
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,630
I can't remember.

257
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,570
I can't remember.

258
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,230
I didn't forget lock-on.

259
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,990
I just decided not to use it.

260
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:01,410
Status.

261
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:01,710
Status.

262
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,390
Status?

263
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,470
What?

264
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,330
Status?

265
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,660
Revenge.

266
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:30,960
Screenshot!

267
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,980
No, don't screenshot!

268
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,660
Okay, I don't think I have any items, do I?

269
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,180
Okay, no.

270
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,680
I have no vital stars.

271
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,120
Because they keep making them more expensive.

272
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,980
So, we're just gonna have to be good at the game.

273
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,480
Oh goodness.

274
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,160
Did that get me?

275
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,660
Honestly, I feel like this is better for...

276
00:16:59,380 --> 00:16:59,980
What the?

277
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,120
Where did that come from?

278
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,920
Oh, we're already at round 2.

279
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,620
Phase 2.

280
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,740
Oh, he's frozen again?

281
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,640
I feel like this is better than locking on.

282
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,100
Oh god!

283
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,280
Move Dante!

284
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,280
Move Dante!

285
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,320
Move Dante!

286
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,920
Gosh, why is he going to phase 2?

287
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,800
Is there a phase 3?

288
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,260
I'm scared.

289
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,220
Dante, run away!

290
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,000
Maybe I should trickster for that.

291
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,020
Wait, you can't run and change things at the same...

292
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,620
Oh, you can...

293
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,340
Oh, okay, nevermind.

294
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,160
I was wrong.

295
00:17:59,420 --> 00:17:59,620
Okay.

296
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,000
Goodbye.

297
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,280
Oh, no, no, no.

298
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:04,980
No, no, no!

299
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,900
Okay, I'm still getting used to it.

300
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,380
Oh, this one is gunning.

301
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,260
This one's gunning.

302
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,100
Trickster!

303
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,600
I'm not gonna make it!

304
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,980
I'm not gonna make it!

305
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,410
Oh my god, there's like nothing that...

306
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,950
Lots of switching.

307
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,230
Yeah, I don't think...

308
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:51,690
Okay, no.

309
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,130
I don't want to pay for any more vital stars.

310
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,260
Okay.

311
00:18:59,340 --> 00:18:59,840
Gun.

312
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:00,920
Sword.

313
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:01,900
Trick.

314
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,080
I don't think...

315
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,360
People were saying that Royal Guard is kind of difficult.

316
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,500
I think...

317
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,900
I think I'm gonna...

318
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,040
Stick to these for now.

319
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,080
The main point of the air combo is actually not the attack itself, but also the fact that it slows your fall.

320
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,120
Yeah, because...

321
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,000
I do notice that, because it's like...

322
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,900
He'll spray the ground and I'll try to jump in the air and not...

323
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,280
You know, get that in the way of that.

324
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,600
You gotta time it perfectly to get the most out of Royal Guard.

325
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,780
The hardest was strongest.

326
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,100
Can I even parry this dog?

327
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,500
Does he do any...

328
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,080
Does he...

329
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,220
Yes!

330
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,280
You can parry anything!

331
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,090
I'll do my best.

332
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,630
What am I...

333
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,210
Sorry, master.

334
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:07,450
Oh, wait.

335
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,300
Oh, shoot!

336
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,240
He got me!

337
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,340
He still managed to get me!

338
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,560
Stupid dog.

339
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,060
Jump!

340
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,860
Kind of fumbled that, you guys.

341
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,120
Dog.

342
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,070
Holy shoot!

343
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:06,790
OK.

344
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:07,750
Jaxer!

345
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,970
Did I hit me?

346
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,850
I don't know, actually.

347
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:15,490
OK.

348
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,510
Oh my god, no!

349
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,170
No!

350
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,590
Oh, that's not what I meant to do!

351
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,270
Get him!

352
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,110
OK.

353
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:33,910
Oi!

354
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,050
Trickster!

355
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:40,970
Oh gosh.

356
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:41,670
Speed!

357
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:42,290
OK.

358
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:46,110
Jump!

359
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:47,770
Dante!

360
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,390
Oh no!

361
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,330
Trick!

362
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:50,990
Speed!

363
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,430
Oh gosh.

364
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,850
Oh gosh!

365
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,510
Guys, I'm not gonna make it!

366
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,770
I'm scared.

367
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,170
I only like to switch between two things.

368
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,670
Oh no!

369
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,410
No, no, no!

370
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:07,670
I'm scared!

371
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:14,900
Jump!

372
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:18,640
Oh gosh!

373
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,000
Trick!

374
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,140
Trick!

375
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,890
We're getting closer, but...

376
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,450
He's all frozen again!

377
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,290
He's not gonna take any damage!

378
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,750
You stupid dog!

379
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,330
You stupid dog!

380
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,270
Oh gosh!

381
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:41,550
Oh!

382
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,070
One HP and a dream!

383
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,750
One HP and a dream!

384
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:03,560
I gotta remember to switch to my guns...

385
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,300
When I am far away and scared.

386
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,460
NT!

387
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,280
NT!

388
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:11,600
NT!

389
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:12,680
NT!

390
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,600
Where am I going?

391
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,180
Camera, can you stop it for a second?

392
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,820
Guns break the ice easier.

393
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,520
Oh really?

394
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,160
Good to know.

395
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,560
So, I'm gonna...

396
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:40,730
Oh!

397
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,050
OK.

398
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:41,690
Cool.

399
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,620
Big gains!

400
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,420
Big gains!

401
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,920
I need some help!

402
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:58,720
I need some help!

403
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,760
That's fine.

404
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,140
You know what?

405
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,580
That's fine.

406
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,540
Oh!

407
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,740
No, no, no!

408
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,130
Trickster!

409
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,370
Oh God!

410
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,000
Oh my God!

411
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,820
OK, I gotta get away from him when he does that.

412
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,780
I gotta get away from him when he does that, for real.

413
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,780
Oh God!

414
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,540
He's gonna charge!

415
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:42,920
No!

416
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,700
I knew it!

417
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,720
I knew it!

418
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,040
That was mid...

419
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,560
That was mid-attack.

420
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:49,860
Jump!

421
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,440
And trickster!

422
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,460
Leave!

423
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:53,720
Leave!

424
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,540
OK, OK.

425
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,840
Oh gosh!

426
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,700
He's gonna barge, right?

427
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,560
Or he's gonna do his little ice ball, yeah?

428
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,000
There we go.

429
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,900
How do I switch?

430
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,420
Oh, there we go.

431
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,000
It's the press, I remember.

432
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:34,840
Oh God!

433
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,560
Nice!

434
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:57,570
Is he gonna charge again?

435
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,270
No, he's backing up, right?

436
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,130
He's doing that weird backup thing.

437
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,570
Jump, jump, jump!

438
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,550
I still managed to...

439
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:32,530
Oh my God!

440
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,450
Please, I'm trying to jump!

441
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,440
Wow.

442
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,520
How is he not second phase yet?

443
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:41,800
OK.

444
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,520
I think he's about to be...

445
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:45,960
OK.

446
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,840
Oh shit!

447
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,340
OK, gun.

448
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,260
Gun's in time.

449
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,720
Oh God!

450
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,780
Did he just shoot at me?

451
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,780
Or...

452
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,280
Am I crazy?

453
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,900
Trick, trick, trick, trick!

454
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,600
Trick, trick, trick, trick, trick, trick!

455
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,580
OK.

456
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,200
Oh gosh, OK.

457
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,600
Oh shoot!

458
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,940
I did not even just notice that he was gonna do that.

459
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,460
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

460
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,460
OK.

461
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,100
I can't tell sometimes when he's just barking away or if he's about to do something.

462
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:31,780
Jump, jump!

463
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,510
Almost had him.

464
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,610
That was a pretty good run at the start.

465
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,070
That was pretty good at the start.

466
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,030
Not so bad.

467
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,090
OK.

468
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,210
I'm just gonna start in gunslinger.

469
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,650
I'm going to see if I can beat this before you.

470
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,310
OK, go ahead.

471
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:07,990
Sure.

472
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,070
OK.

473
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,400
Meant to so bad.

474
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,740
I'm gonna see if I can beat this.

475
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,480
Oh my god.

476
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,220
Oh my god.

477
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:21,920
I didn't even...

478
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,320
Shit.

479
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,560
See, he just kinda like chills there.

480
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,720
I don't know what he's doing.

481
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,230
Holy moly!

482
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,470
How did I manage to avoid that?

483
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,050
I don't know!

484
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,070
Oh shoot!

485
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,030
Oh god, I didn't notice that he was going into...

486
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,250
He's like not super frozen?

487
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,140
Is he...

488
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,500
Oh, can we

489
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,130
like keep styling on him?

490
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:32,910
There we go.

491
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,490
Jump!

492
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,770
Oh man.

493
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,090
I'm not very good at avoiding that one.

494
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,510
No!

495
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,070
Please stop it!

496
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,890
Oh my god.

497
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,760
Oh god!

498
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,940
Stop, please!

499
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,080
This freaking dog!

500
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,000
Oh, he's back to being...

501
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,910
You messed up!

502
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:20,710
No!

503
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,730
I don't think this is the friend, you guys.

504
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,290
Oh, whoops.

505
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,860
Chill dog, damn.

506
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,340
That's what I'm saying.

507
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,080
You can buy a vital star if you want.

508
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,820
How much was it?

509
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,030
Maybe I should.

510
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,190
Don't forget you have stinger.

511
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,090
Oh, how did I use that?

512
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:10,870
How do I use that again?

513
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,810
It's...

514
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:12,410
Hold on.

515
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,410
I don't remember.

516
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,830
Nice try, restart NTR.

517
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,550
Let's not normalize that.

518
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,270
Lock on forward melee.

519
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:32,650
Lock on forward melee.

520
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,270
Can I do that as trickster too?

521
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,870
Oh, I can.

522
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:52,750
Okay,

523
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,020
I'm gonna buy one.

524
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,160
But I'm only gonna use it if I really think the run is salvageable.

525
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,780
I'll only use it if I think the run is salvageable.

526
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,600
I could've bought a blorb.

527
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,000
Maybe that would've been better.

528
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,000
Well, I've already made my choices.

529
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,640
I've made my choices.

530
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:21,780
I've made my choices.

531
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,450
Come here, pup.

532
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:31,670
Puppy dog.

533
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,140
Alright.

534
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,220
What was it?

535
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,200
Lock on.

536
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,460
Lock on.

537
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,620
Melee.

538
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,440
Oh, it doesn't really do much, does it?

539
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,800
Maybe a sword master does more?

540
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,760
I guess it's just the legs, huh?

541
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,020
I'm not doing anything.

542
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,100
I'm doing no damage, you guys.

543
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,240
Was I not doing it right?

544
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:31,980
Oh, nice.

545
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,420
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

546
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,940
He's down, he's down!

547
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,500
Get him while he's down!

548
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,020
Get him while he's down!

549
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,040
Oh god, he's about to...

550
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,260
Okay.

551
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,620
Oh, wait.

552
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:46,960
Oh, shoot.

553
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,820
Oh, he's back.

554
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,100
Okay.

555
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,760
He's charging, he's charging!

556
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,480
I don't know why I was like, Oh yeah, he's charging, I'm gonna...

557
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:04,620
Okay.

558
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,160
Okay.

559
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,120
Oh, no.

560
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,080
Shit!

561
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,600
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

562
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,020
I did the wrong thing anyway.

563
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,360
Wait.

564
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,480
Move, move, move, move, move!

565
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:14,860
Dante!

566
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,840
I can't tell.

567
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,840
I'm really bad at reading his movements.

568
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,880
Okay, he does like twice on each side.

569
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,100
Run, run, run, Dante!

570
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:39,700
Run!

571
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,720
Oh, he's gonna charge, he's gonna charge!

572
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,880
Oh, shit.

573
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,660
Oh my god.

574
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,420
How am I...

575
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:02,680
Guys?

576
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,740
How am I alive?

577
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,020
I'm actually...

578
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,940
It's pixel perfect.

579
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,120
One HP.

580
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,800
Do I use it, you think?

581
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,010
I don't think it'll...

582
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,250
I think I should've bought the L-Star.

583
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,690
I think I should've bought the L-Star.

584
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,030
Yeah, I'm using my GameShark right now.

585
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:44,850
Not worth it.

586
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:46,130
Yeah.

587
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,190
Don't use it.

588
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:52,130
I mean, it's for sure I'll die, but...

589
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,890
You should not have bought any.

590
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,810
Oh my god.

591
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,490
Why the hell did you do that, you stupid dummy?

592
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,330
You stupid bee.

593
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,390
If I were playing, I wouldn't have bought a single one.

594
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,690
Oh god, okay.

595
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,650
Should've bought the W-Star.

596
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,990
Instead of the L-Star.

597
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,310
Sorry, I'm stalling because...

598
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,710
I'm shaking because I get nervous about fights.

599
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,330
Okay.

600
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,930
Oh, I'm stalling.

601
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:33,710
I'm stalling.

602
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,050
Chip with guns.

603
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,410
Maybe if I stay away and just...

604
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,630
Watch me die instantly.

605
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,470
This'll be so funny.

606
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,380
Oh, we lost a head!

607
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,520
Wait, we're doing big damage.

608
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,420
Oh shit.

609
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,450
Guys, I think I want to use my star.

610
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,670
I think I want to use my star actually.

611
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:21,950
I think so.

612
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,030
I think so.

613
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:23,730
I'm scared.

614
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,130
I'm not ready.

615
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:33,490
Okay.

616
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,170
Oh, sorry.

617
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,590
God, I keep doing this.

618
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,600
Oh shit.

619
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,090
No, get the head.

620
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:54,750
There we go.

621
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,360
Oh shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

622
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,730
I didn't even need to use the star!

623
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,410
I didn't even need to use the star!

624
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,200
I'll take that as a 1 HP.

625
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:50,320
Yay!

626
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,800
I harness his power?

627
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,160
What is that?

628
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,090
Oh, we're nunchuking!

629
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,090
Well done, Minky.

630
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:22,930
Thank you!

631
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:23,890
Cerberus!

632
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:27,750
A weapon of three interlocking rods infuses the elemental power of ice!

633
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:29,530
Yay!

634
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,730
Change devil arms.

635
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:37,510
Oh, in freestyle mode you can freely change the devil arms by using R while pressing ZR.

636
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:44,010
Press ZR and alternate devil arms in a clockwise fashion.

637
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,390
Oh yeah, give me my robes.

638
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,750
Look, we made back our money!

639
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:51,610
I've been bested.

640
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,970
Take my soul and move forward.

641
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,570
Thank you.

642
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,730
What the fuck?

643
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,030
Yay, I love Gunslinger!

644
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,510
I'm so glad I played DMC2!

645
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,610
This nunchuk's revolver move is my favorite move in the entire...

646
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:20,890
Nunchuk's revolver?

647
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:29,150
My favorite bit about DMC3 is the bosses are like, you're pretty good, use my soul and go kick ass in style.

648
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,690
Should I sword master with it?

649
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,130
Seems like a pretty good weapon.

650
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,510
But I can't stinger with it.

651
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,270
What other abilities do we have?

652
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,830
Wait, can I like, go back to the...

653
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,850
I'm assuming there's a statue this way.

654
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,790
I might be assuming wrong.

655
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:57,670
I might be dumb.

656
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:00,990
No

657
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,240
gaming!

658
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,430
This game...

659
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,630
I never know what's going to happen next.

660
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,970
No way!

661
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:43,170
I thought he was just going to Matrix style it but...

662
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,490
Heterochromia.

663
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,950
Hello Yuna.

664
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,850
He's so calm and cool and galactic.

665
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:01,930
Oh.

666
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,890
Yeah, it does Dante.

667
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,250
Agreed baby!

668
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,230
Freestyle.

669
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,150
Could've been better.

670
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,090
S.

671
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,070
Stylish point C.

672
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,350
D.

673
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:24,030
V.

674
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,170
You can do that in game if I...

675
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:28,790
No way.

676
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,410
I got a C for...

677
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:31,750
C.

678
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,610
Told you you could do it.

679
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:40,710
Status files, dev alarms will show you all the combos you've unlocked so far.

680
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:41,510
Oh, thanks Nicholas!

681
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:45,210
Actually yeah.

682
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:48,590
I don't want to redo the fight.

683
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,360
Let's go.

684
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,520
My brother.

685
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:02,000
He's in galaxy, he's in space.

686
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:12,810
Oh my god, his eyes are kind of bugging.

687
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:19,470
He's like, a woman?

688
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:30,390
No girls allowed in my tower.

689
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,190
Oh.

690
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,790
You want to know how I got these scars?

691
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:42,110
Wait, they're moving.

692
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,070
Wait, that's actually so cool.

693
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,050
He said the thing?

694
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:54,090
Is that his thing?

695
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,850
Kuwabara, Kuwabara.

696
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,910
A storm is approaching.

697
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,250
The uninvited one.

698
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,130
Find the key to the stars.

699
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:06,290
Dante treats this whole thing like a party.

700
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:09,430
So of course a party only gets better when a chick goes too.

701
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:10,910
Dante, my brother.

702
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,570
Action, that's what I wanted to say.

703
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:17,450
Cerberus.

704
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:18,130
Revolver!

705
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:19,650
Wait, it's actually called Revolver.

706
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:20,730
And Windmill.

707
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:24,910
15,000, we're just a little bit short.

708
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,760
I'm kind of close to Air Hike.

709
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,620
I think I was saving up for Air Hike last time.

710
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,700
Stinger 2 is real good.

711
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,740
I could get that.

712
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,300
But I want to try Cerberus a little bit.

713
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:53,930
My guns.

714
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,250
What was it?

715
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:57,970
Wait.

716
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,310
How was it to see the combos again?

717
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:04,630
Understand.

718
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:09,830
No.

719
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:13,350
Action, thank you.

720
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:14,890
Wait.

721
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,070
Oh, it's got to be in the, oh wait, is that under information?

722
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,210
R, forward, X.

723
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:26,730
Status file, Devil Arms.

724
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,370
Okay, so it's a little bit different.

725
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,470
Okay, I'll do it when we start the game.

726
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:38,070
That's kind of sick.

727
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,280
Doors casually on fire, you know how it is.

728
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,640
Map screen.

729
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,720
Get in your bearings.

730
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,800
Select the map from the status screen.

731
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,500
Overhead view of the map shows your surrounding area from over perspective.

732
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:06,360
Freeze frame shows a graphical image from the room you currently occupy.

733
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,720
Side view.

734
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:09,860
Okay.

735
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,220
Thanks, Kim.

736
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,080
Okay.

737
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,050
Status.

738
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:22,670
File.

739
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:27,030
Devil Arms.

740
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:33,150
Thanks for the gift, thank you.

741
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:34,890
Rebellion.

742
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:37,250
Rebellion.

743
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,270
Oh, X, X, X.

744
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:43,970
Naughty.

745
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,410
Rebellion combo.

746
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:47,930
X, pause, X, X.

747
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:48,950
Helm breaker.

748
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:50,670
X in the middle area.

749
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:52,010
Stinger.

750
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:54,850
R, forward, X.

751
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:57,910
High time.

752
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:01,130
Hold X to jump.

753
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:03,850
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

754
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:06,170
Million stab.

755
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:10,570
Press X repeatedly while executing a type 2 combo.

756
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:12,850
Oh, that's it.

757
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:13,390
Oh, wait.

758
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,070
And we haven't done anything really.

759
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:16,350
Oh, we know high time.

760
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:27,290
Element of ice.

761
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:29,270
X, X, X, X, X.

762
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:29,910
Come on.

763
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:33,350
X, X, pause.

764
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:35,530
X, X.

765
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:37,070
X, X.

766
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:38,750
X, X.

767
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:39,710
Swing.

768
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:40,810
X midair.

769
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:43,350
Revolver.

770
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:46,030
R, X, forward.

771
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:46,470
Okay.

772
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:49,730
X, X, X, X, X.

773
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:50,910
So many X.

774
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:53,850
X, X, X, X, X, X.

775
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:59,130
Repeatedly press X while executing a type 2 combo.

776
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:03,780
Okay.

777
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:04,940
I'll try to remember.

778
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,240
X, X, pause.

779
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,600
X, X.

780
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,580
X, X, X.

781
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,060
X, X.

782
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,480
X, X, X, X.

783
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,200
Press X to combo.

784
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,120
Wait, oh.

785
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,460
This looks like it's, you know, breakable or something.

786
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:36,460
No?

787
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,120
What is this place anyway?

788
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,620
What is this?

789
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:43,400
Wait.

790
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,740
Can I run up walls or am I crazy?

791
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,740
This looks like a place to run up.

792
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:52,180
Ahem.

793
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:02,430
You had wall jump with trickster.

794
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:09,090
It appears to be an elevator shaft.

795
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:10,310
Oh.

796
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:15,050
Okay.

797
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:18,710
Well, maybe we'll use it later.

798
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,660
This seems to be, you just walk around it.

799
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,520
We'll just ignore that for now.

800
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:37,260
Okay, there was the door that it showed, but...

801
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:42,320
I will not give up an opportunity to grab a orb.

802
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:43,480
Oh, there's the door.

803
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,020
It's on the other side.

804
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:45,520
Let's see.

805
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,800
What is that sound?

806
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,020
What is that clacky sound?

807
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:01,060
I see something here.

808
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:02,240
Oh.

809
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,480
Ah.

810
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,600
How do we...okay, hold on.

811
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,360
Do we go up from this way?

812
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,540
Tick tock?

813
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,600
What's a clock?

814
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,500
Tick tock on the clock.

815
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:15,980
Alright.

816
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,220
XXX.

817
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,320
Mint disgusting girlfriend.

818
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:29,680
I have

819
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:34,950
to be quiet.

820
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,710
There are so many surprises for you to encounter.

821
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,930
Yeah, no spoilers.

822
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:40,310
Massive stone wall bars your path.

823
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,190
You cannot proceed.

824
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:44,970
What?

825
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:53,300
Oh, there's just a orb down there.

826
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,640
I was about to miss it.

827
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:56,220
Nice.

828
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,280
What the hell is that sound?

829
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,100
It's over here.

830
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:02,980
Maybe?

831
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:08,170
Oh.

832
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:10,090
Oh, well, I made it.

833
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:12,290
I just...not yet.

834
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:15,450
How do I get to there?

835
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:18,090
Sneaky off-screen orb.

836
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,850
There was another one over here too.

837
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:20,650
I saw it.

838
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:26,210
Was there anything up here?

839
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:28,750
This one is blue and the other one is gold.

840
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:32,330
Oh.

841
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:33,410
Oh, well...

842
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,170
I did get it.

843
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:39,270
Dante, can you, like, grab onto a ledge, please?

844
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,260
I think...

845
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:51,880
I'm stupid.

846
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,460
Can I do that over ledges?

847
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,740
I don't remember how to...hold on.

848
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,100
She has arthritis.

849
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,360
I don't think...

850
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,140
I'm so sorry, Dante.

851
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:02,320
Fantastic.

852
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,440
I can't use this mid-air.

853
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,120
That kind of sucks.

854
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,500
You can dash forward toward a ledge.

855
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:10,740
Okay.

856
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,940
Sorry, I'm still trying to get...

857
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,640
Thank you.

858
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,660
Still remembering controls and all that.

859
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,280
What is the clock that I'm hearing?

860
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,140
If I fall here...

861
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,420
Why don't I hear it anymore?

862
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:37,150
Hmm.

863
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:40,830
My Yoshi is lost.

864
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:42,210
I'm not lost!

865
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:45,510
I'm trying to figure out how to get this dang item over here.

866
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,440
Well, I guess let's just try the door first.

867
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,200
Is that where I'm hearing the noise from?

868
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,150
Try and get me!

869
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:15,870
Try and get me!

870
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:18,090
Try and get me!

871
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:18,650
Try and get me!

872
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:19,210
Try and get me!

873
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:19,750
Try and get me!

874
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:20,450
Try and get me!

875
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:22,110
Try and get me!

876
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:24,230
I'm having a blast.

877
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:25,190
Beat it for blast.

878
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:31,010
Oh yeah, we gotta taunt so we can get some...

879
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:36,250
Here, let's get one for the thumbnail.

880
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:38,270
Alright Dante, say cheese!

881
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:40,930
What?

882
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:44,930
I can't break these?

883
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:47,610
They offer me nothing?

884
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:51,770
Oh no.

885
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,350
Red is defeat all enemies, right?

886
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:56,730
Or is it the puzzle one?

887
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:01,860
Oh.

888
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,160
Red is kill.

889
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,220
Oh my gosh, it's kind of awesome.

890
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,360
Wait, I remember these guys from last time.

891
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,540
I avoided them like the plague.

892
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,680
Crazy combo!

893
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:24,440
During certain circumstances, you can repeatedly press a button to execute a special high-speed combo attack.

894
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,420
Press X repeatedly while performing the stinger.

895
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,400
Oh yeah, the...

896
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,480
Gunslinger, press...

897
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,800
Repeatedly press Y near a downed enemy.

898
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,460
From mission 3, yeah.

899
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,400
Sobinox!

900
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,420
Welcome to my membership!

901
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,080
Thank you!

902
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,140
Okay.

903
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,840
I can't see anything!

904
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,180
Oh shoot!

905
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,920
Which is a good idea actually.

906
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,060
Oh damn.

907
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:58,780
Oh!

908
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:00,840
Oh my god!

909
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,200
Shoot!

910
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,580
Camera, I can't...

911
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:16,050
Jump!

912
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:16,830
Dodge!

913
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:17,890
Dodge and jump!

914
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:20,170
Okay, hold on, this is...

915
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:20,750
Oh no, okay.

916
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:22,190
Oh my god.

917
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,480
Why is the dodge so slow?

918
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,020
Oh shit.

919
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,490
I'm not good at timing this, huh?

920
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,360
Level 1 dodge.

921
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,800
Wait, actually, is that what it is?

922
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,080
Oh, I got one though.

923
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,680
Let's go.

924
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:02,060
No.

925
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:03,680
Wait, there's another one!

926
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,260
No, bro!

927
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:10,860
Oh my gosh.

928
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:11,180
Okay.

929
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,840
Give me the robes, please.

930
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,200
Thank you.

931
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,540
Oh my gosh.

932
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:19,700
No, no.

933
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,280
That guy.

934
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:30,020
I think I can get him from...

935
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:31,490
Can they reach me?

936
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:31,890
I wonder.

937
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:37,250
What the...

938
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,380
Oh, I'm on gunslinger.

939
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:47,560
I got...

940
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:47,980
Oh my god.

941
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,020
Camera, please!

942
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:01,130
Oh god!

943
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:02,690
Oh my god, I'm gonna die in here.

944
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:04,130
I'm gonna freaking die in here.

945
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:05,890
No, please!

946
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:08,190
Oh gosh!

947
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:09,110
Oh my god, please.

948
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:10,010
I'm just trying to run.

949
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:11,970
I'm just trying to run.

950
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:12,850
Oh, this thing.

951
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:13,710
Oh no!

952
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:28,970
He's not dead, is he?

953
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:30,350
Oh, shit.

954
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:31,850
Oh, shit.

955
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:33,210
Oh, shit.

956
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,670
Oh, shoot.

957
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:37,710
Which I will do.

958
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:39,330
I'll just try and kill him.

959
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:48,130
Okay.

960
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:54,510
It's...

961
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:56,890
Okay.

962
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:02,770
No, just go up and hit them.

963
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:04,750
He's using a gun.

964
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:06,210
I have no...

965
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:07,930
I should have never used my...

966
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:08,650
Star.

967
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:13,590
I should have never used my star in the last thing.

968
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:15,690
Run, Dante!

969
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:16,970
Run!

970
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:30,940
Icky.

971
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,640
Icky is stupid.

972
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,680
Wait, how many robes do I have now?

973
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,600
I might be able to buy air hike.

974
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:44,960
Oh, 14.

975
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:45,820
Just kidding.

976
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:46,740
Like...

977
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,460
No!

978
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,300
Minto may cry.

979
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,640
Minto will cry.

980
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:01,120
Remember you can change weapon mid-combo.

981
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,920
That sounds really hard for my hands.

982
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:13,940
Like...

983
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,260
Mid-combo?

984
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,080
Didn't you say you couldn't cry?

985
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:25,660
I couldn't cry.

986
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,240
It sounds harder than it is, really?

987
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:28,840
Okay.

988
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,660
It's my birthday today!

989
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,700
Would I be able to get a happy birthday?

990
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,280
Keeping your adorable self a day with the mainstream is always a good one.

991
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,200
Solidus Skink!

992
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,540
Happy birthday!

993
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,800
Happy birthday to you.

994
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,840
Happy birthday to you.

995
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,020
Happy birthday, Solidus Skink.

996
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:55,400
Happy birthday to you.

997
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,780
Happy birthday!

998
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:02,120
Okay.

999
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:04,960
Come here, you.

1000
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:19,130
Oh, just...

1001
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:22,370
I never got caught with the nunchucks, I'm just saying.

1002
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:27,310
What was it that you can...oh wait.

1003
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:32,090
You can press Y when you're in Gunslinger with a guy that's down.

1004
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:33,950
I wanna try that too.

1005
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:36,830
Okay.

1006
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:39,310
How do I want to do...

1007
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:43,310
How do I want to do...

1008
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:47,930
Wait.

1009
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:50,830
Which one is it for...

1010
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:53,530
Oh, there we go.

1011
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:53,690
Okay.

1012
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:58,710
Great thing about restarts is you keep the rorbs and experience points for your style from enemies.

1013
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:01,530
Yeah, that's why, honestly, it's not so bad.

1014
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:05,210
I mean it's bad, but it's not the worst.

1015
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:06,890
It could be the worst.

1016
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:08,270
But it's not the worst.

1017
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:11,870
They give you a little bit of a...

1018
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:13,710
leeway.

1019
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,260
These guys though, I hate them.

1020
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,860
I hate these guys a lot, actually.

1021
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,180
They're tough.

1022
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,100
They're really tough.

1023
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:34,320
Oh my god.

1024
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:38,960
See, I can't even...I can't even get a movement without them firing at me.

1025
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:42,840
Oh, gosh.

1026
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:45,820
No, please.

1027
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:07,190
And how do I get this guy more easily?

1028
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:09,570
Wait.

1029
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,520
I'm doing the wrong thing.

1030
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,680
There we go, this is what I'm trying to do.

1031
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:19,700
Okay, nice.

1032
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:23,060
And then, the guys manifest.

1033
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:23,620
Yeah.

1034
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,840
Then we have these guys manifesting.

1035
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,040
Dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge!

1036
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:32,680
Dodgey!

1037
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,740
Okay, I think I got him.

1038
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:46,840
Nice, okay.

1039
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,160
Okay, awesome.

1040
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:01,300
They're jumping at me.

1041
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:03,280
Nice.

1042
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,940
Keep the... Oh, my rorbs are down here!

1043
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:08,620
Messed up!

1044
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:17,740
Nice.

1045
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:18,220
Breakdown.

1046
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,500
Okay, let's go get the other guy.

1047
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:22,340
Oh my gosh.

1048
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,340
I love Stinger!

1049
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,940
Oh, nice.

1050
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,020
Okay, perfect.

1051
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,940
There's still more, but where are they?

1052
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:43,690
That would explain that.

1053
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:44,710
Nice.

1054
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:46,970
Oh, my rorbs!

1055
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:57,880
That one was so much better than the first try.

1056
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:04,770
This try was so much better than the first try.

1057
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:06,030
Okay.

1058
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:13,790
To the being with the will of the thunderstorm, I bestow the soul of steel.

1059
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:16,870
Thunderstorm.

1060
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:24,470
Stinger is always the way to go.

1061
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:26,690
I should have never doubted.

1062
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:28,350
Stinger, my beloved.

1063
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,260
Thunder.

1064
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:35,280
Do I know any moves that do thunder?

1065
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:39,830
The stole.

1066
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:40,530
Shut up.

1067
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:42,810
Shut up.

1068
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:44,550
The will of the thunderstorm.

1069
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,170
No Alastor yet.

1070
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:07,430
You don't have it yet.

1071
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:17,130
I'll be back for you, my precious.

1072
01:05:17,570 --> 01:05:18,530
I don't even know what that is.

1073
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,450
But it's shiny and I do want it.

1074
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,120
Silent Sanctuary.

1075
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:35,740
I'm afraid of doing anything with that yet.

1076
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,440
Oh, these do break.

1077
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:44,140
Of course they do.

1078
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:47,460
Of course they do.

1079
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:49,900
Breakdown.

1080
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,060
Give me everything.

1081
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,240
I'm robbing this place for all it's worth.

1082
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:01,300
Yes!

1083
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,160
We have enough!

1084
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,440
We have enough for air hike.

1085
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,060
Let's go.

1086
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:21,920
Money, money.

1087
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,160
Make the money babe.

1088
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:28,360
What's up there?

1089
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:30,240
OK, let's do this.

1090
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:40,590
I'm on?

1091
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,080
We're going high.

1092
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,160
We're going all the way up to the top, baby.

1093
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:58,700
Oh my god.

1094
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:16,910
Nice.

1095
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:21,950
Oh, I'm not even close to him.

1096
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:26,630
There we go.

1097
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:27,870
Who else?

1098
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:32,090
Oh, there's a lot of them.

1099
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:39,530
Oh god, what is he doing?

1100
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,920
Let's get this guy first.

1101
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:49,080
Get out of my way.

1102
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,420
You're throwing off my groove.

1103
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:52,000
Oh shoot.

1104
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:55,280
Nice.

1105
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,040
Watch out!

1106
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:03,560
Oh, someone else came in.

1107
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:04,340
Who are you?

1108
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:07,520
Oh, there's two of them.

1109
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:09,100
Oh my god.

1110
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:14,480
I have a... I have a...

1111
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:21,990
Can you... OK, Dante, when you do that, you need to actually be hitting them.

1112
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:32,560
Where'd he go?

1113
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,080
Oh, there we go.

1114
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:47,190
Is there anything up here?

1115
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:49,430
Where these guys came from, even?

1116
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:52,870
There's a blorb, I think.

1117
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:55,050
How do I get all the way up there?

1118
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,320
Style on them.

1119
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,360
We're styling.

1120
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:08,780
There we go.

1121
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:12,240
Easy.

1122
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,360
I don't even need to be Trickster.

1123
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:18,960
I'm too good at this game.

1124
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,140
It only took me an hour plus for one boss, but...

1125
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:34,980
That's just how the cookie gets eaten.

1126
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:48,980
Got it.

1127
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,040
Oh, there it is.

1128
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,580
And there they are.

1129
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,400
Oh, they're right here.

1130
01:09:58,800 --> 01:09:59,460
In front of me.

1131
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:01,940
Nice.

1132
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:09,890
Don't fall.

1133
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:12,110
Oh, there's... Oh no!

1134
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:12,610
OK.

1135
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:29,500
Wait, I do have to go up there.

1136
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,400
OK, hold on, let's see.

1137
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:32,640
Relaxing low-key.

1138
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:33,240
Yeah.

1139
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:37,800
Oh, come on, Dante!

1140
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:40,540
Dante.

1141
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,000
Dante, use your big boy legs.

1142
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:42,660
Come on, buddy.

1143
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:47,850
Grab!

1144
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:51,450
Wait a second.

1145
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:52,870
Can I just double jump here?

1146
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,050
Oh, I'm an idiot.

1147
01:10:56,670 --> 01:11:00,050
I was making it more difficult for myself.

1148
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,800
Give me the money.

1149
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,100
Give me the money.

1150
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:09,300
What is this thing anyway?

1151
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:15,260
It's freaky.

1152
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,340
I thought I was going to fall all the way down to the bottom.

1153
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:25,480
What is this?

1154
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:31,420
A tablet with a round indentation lies in front of a large rotating gear.

1155
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:36,920
Large metal gear, you would say?

1156
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:42,660
One would call it... that... word.

1157
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:56,300
Not now, Mint.

1158
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:57,740
I'm watching DMC3.

1159
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,000
You're right, sorry.

1160
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:01,760
Wait, where did the other door go?

1161
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:05,160
Oh,

1162
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:10,790
now I've done it.

1163
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:11,470
Wait, where am I?

1164
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:12,650
Oh, OK.

1165
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:13,870
We're right here.

1166
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:16,350
There.

1167
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:17,530
Actually, this is faster.

1168
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:25,520
Hello?

1169
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,060
I'm scared.

1170
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:39,840
I'm scared.

1171
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:45,560
Oh my God.

1172
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:46,840
Oh shoot, it's this thing.

1173
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,540
Shoot, it's this thing.

1174
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:12,230
Oh God, oh God, oh God.

1175
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:22,870
Stay down!

1176
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:27,110
Oh my God, these guys are so...

1177
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:28,350
Oh my God.

1178
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:37,200
I'll chill.

1179
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:40,760
I'll chill, chill, chill.

1180
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,380
Stop, leave me alone.

1181
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,080
Can I get my orbs over here?

1182
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:44,520
Thank you.

1183
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:50,000
Gosh, they're so fast.

1184
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:50,100
So fast.

1185
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,380
Oh, there's another guy.

1186
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,140
Oh God, oh God, oh God.

1187
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:01,240
Oh no, no, no, please.

1188
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:02,940
Please, another one.

1189
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:05,880
Oh my God, no, no, that's not...

1190
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:06,980
Oh God, I'm gonna die in here.

1191
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,420
I'm gonna die in here.

1192
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,480
I'm gonna die.

1193
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:31,240
I survived.

1194
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:31,300
What?

1195
01:14:36,990 --> 01:14:42,200
What about the stairs though?

1196
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:47,690
Steal thy soul.

1197
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:52,050
The future knows no bounds for those who deftly march forth to meet it.

1198
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:09,980
Does that mean I shouldn't have taken the stairs?

1199
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:17,710
Health is not high enough.

1200
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:26,900
Oh God.

1201
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:30,500
Oh God.

1202
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:52,310
Can I get on top of it?

1203
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:56,730
Get up on the Hydra's back.

1204
01:15:57,050 --> 01:15:57,610
Where'd he go?

1205
01:15:57,930 --> 01:15:59,350
I'll just wait for him to come back, I guess.

1206
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:16,580
Now...

1207
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:23,840
Oh, that was close, wasn't it?

1208
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:24,680
I

1209
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:34,500
think he was getting electric again.

1210
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:41,740
Can't see anything.

1211
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:44,400
I think he's here.

1212
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:51,140
Oh, you jerk.

1213
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:00,730
It's weak to ice?

1214
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:02,110
Wait, it is?

1215
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:07,610
Wait,

1216
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:11,870
didn't I switch?

1217
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:22,110
Oh, I forgot in this game I could change camera angles.

1218
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:35,200
I don't think I'm gonna make it though.

1219
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:44,170
Oh, this is different.

1220
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:44,950
This is new.

1221
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:45,030
Oh?

1222
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:48,910
I can't reach.

1223
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:52,690
Why did I change the camera angle?

1224
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:53,410
I can't see anything.

1225
01:17:54,610 --> 01:17:56,010
Where do you think he's gonna come from?

1226
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:06,910
Oh, he's already...

1227
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:07,710
Oh, shoot!

1228
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:09,090
Oh gosh, I'm dumb.

1229
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:10,450
I can't see anything!

1230
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:13,770
Oh God.

1231
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:15,450
Uh...

1232
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,110
Uh...

1233
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:23,770
Okay.

1234
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:26,910
Patience.

1235
01:18:29,130 --> 01:18:30,710
Patience, everybody.

1236
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:35,950
Oh my God.

1237
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:39,070
Oh, stupid bug.

1238
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:44,930
Stupid depth perception.

1239
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:47,450
My depth perception can't handle things like this.

1240
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:52,670
Oh my God!

1241
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:55,570
I can't see anything!

1242
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,220
He's so kind to me.

1243
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,700
It's the camera too, it really is.

1244
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:04,740
It really is.

1245
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:06,880
I'm doing my best!

1246
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:15,740
In the end I just ended up shooting my gun.

1247
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:17,840
Uh...

1248
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,580
I can't see anything!

1249
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,340
Oh my God.

1250
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:35,850
Okay, at least I was able to get some hits in.

1251
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:36,430
My goodness.

1252
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:40,710
She is sharp.

1253
01:19:43,190 --> 01:19:43,590
Okay.

1254
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:45,950
Oh, he's all the way up there.

1255
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:52,590
Oh, come on!

1256
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:53,270
Oh, there we go.

1257
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:57,070
Get his little butt!

1258
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:07,640
Okay.

1259
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:07,900
Okay.

1260
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:28,230
Okay!

1261
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:32,310
Alright!

1262
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:45,140
Keep at it, Dante!

1263
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:51,290
I don't know how we fell off, but I guess we did.

1264
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:54,870
What's happening?

1265
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:56,190
What's wrong with villain?

1266
01:20:56,910 --> 01:20:57,630
What's wrong, villain?

1267
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:58,770
Oh, I

1268
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:07,040
keep...

1269
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,520
Yeah, Minto fell off.

1270
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:14,540
Is

1271
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:26,190
there any grorbs in this room?

1272
01:21:26,910 --> 01:21:27,270
Anything?

1273
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:31,450
I don't want to get in front of the door, it will attack me.

1274
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:34,130
I don't have my vital star, do I?

1275
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:37,210
I don't have one, you guys.

1276
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:40,130
I don't have a star.

1277
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:41,450
Why do you think I had a star?

1278
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:44,350
I have none.

1279
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:46,950
Why did you guys think I had one?

1280
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:54,260
Oh, well...

1281
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,960
Get out of the way!

1282
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:59,940
Enough for air, Haika.

1283
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:04,100
That would be so helpful here.

1284
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:08,020
That would be so helpful here.

1285
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,380
Oh, gosh.

1286
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:14,280
The camera is the biggest enemy here, for real.

1287
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,020
Oh, and there we go.

1288
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,060
How far do we start from?

1289
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:32,740
Oh, from here.

1290
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:33,100
Okay.

1291
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:43,560
What's

1292
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,360
my...

1293
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:52,720
The camera is bad, but you're trying to jump on him from awkward spots.

1294
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:54,880
There's like three spots I can jump on him from.

1295
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:58,400
There's like the higher ones and then the lower ones.

1296
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:00,960
Try to use lock-on for the boss?

1297
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:01,220
Okay.

1298
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:03,600
I will try.

1299
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,220
Is there... maybe if I go back...

1300
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:12,780
Wasn't there...

1301
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,100
Where's the map?

1302
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:17,600
Is that it?

1303
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:18,620
No?

1304
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,460
Wasn't there a guy...

1305
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:23,200
Oh, it's at the very bottom though, isn't it?

1306
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:25,020
There's a statue only at the very bottom.

1307
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:28,320
I'd have to go back through all the rooms, wouldn't I?

1308
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:39,400
That's far.

1309
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:44,600
Alright, we'll just do it.

1310
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,400
What's my health at though?

1311
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:49,960
I wish I could see.

1312
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:53,580
Oh, it's full.

1313
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:55,920
That would be so good, you guys.

1314
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:59,560
We got this.

1315
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:04,700
We got this.

1316
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:15,650
He's kind of cool.

1317
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,340
Where's a better spot to jump on to him then?

1318
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:28,120
Maybe here?

1319
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,420
There's not many spots I feel.

1320
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:36,680
I can't...

1321
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,320
Oh, maybe here is better.

1322
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,900
The bridge there.

1323
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:44,440
Yeah, yeah.

1324
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:45,480
I got it.

1325
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:45,620
I got it.

1326
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:46,000
I got it.

1327
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,920
I just...

1328
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:51,880
I just need to not miss.

1329
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:55,980
Oh, nice.

1330
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:57,000
Nice dodge.

1331
01:24:58,620 --> 01:24:59,660
Come back!

1332
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:05,630
Ok,

1333
01:25:08,930 --> 01:25:11,420
I can't change the camera here, so...

1334
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:21,660
Couldn't get his little butt.

1335
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:36,880
No!

1336
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,040
I keep doing this.

1337
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:38,620
Oh my god.

1338
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:40,860
I keep jumping or I keep...

1339
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:44,140
I keep attacking too soon.

1340
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:45,340
Ok, ok, ok.

1341
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:47,420
Get his butt!

1342
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:58,030
Big damage!

1343
01:25:58,150 --> 01:25:58,610
Big damage!

1344
01:25:58,850 --> 01:25:59,110
Nice.

1345
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:04,660
That was good.

1346
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:09,400
And he's gonna purple.

1347
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,160
And I jump!

1348
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:16,580
And I...

1349
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:22,960
How did I get such big damage before?

1350
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,080
How did I get all that big damage?

1351
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:34,050
Jump!

1352
01:26:44,570 --> 01:26:45,110
Nice.

1353
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:46,230
Chipping him away.

1354
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:47,710
Deflecting the balls.

1355
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:49,790
I see, I see.

1356
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,730
Which he might do again.

1357
01:26:55,730 --> 01:26:56,450
Oh!

1358
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:06,020
Hey, buddy!

1359
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:11,950
Did it again, kinda.

1360
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:13,650
I'm a baseball player.

1361
01:27:20,410 --> 01:27:23,310
Oh, nice!

1362
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:25,930
We got some damage in.

1363
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:26,750
We got some damage in.

1364
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:28,450
Good, good, good, good, good, good.

1365
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:29,790
We're doing it, guys.

1366
01:27:29,830 --> 01:27:30,490
We're doing it.

1367
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:32,990
Slowly, but surely.

1368
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:34,470
Did you play college ball?

1369
01:27:35,070 --> 01:27:35,650
Yeah.

1370
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:38,050
Cracking...

1371
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:38,510
What was it?

1372
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,210
I don't remember what he said.

1373
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:44,930
Oh my god.

1374
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:48,290
You guys, he drinks me!

1375
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:58,000
University text.

1376
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:04,020
I wish I could see.

1377
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:15,510
We kind of got him a little bit.

1378
01:28:16,530 --> 01:28:18,210
Oh gosh though, am I gonna survive?

1379
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:20,150
I wish he would stop with the purple.

1380
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:23,770
Let me just chip you away, please.

1381
01:28:29,790 --> 01:28:31,370
Oh shit, man!

1382
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:34,450
Is it...

1383
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:41,250
Is it easier to do it with not the nunchucks?

1384
01:28:47,090 --> 01:28:51,350
Here I thought we would be okay, but...

1385
01:28:57,130 --> 01:28:59,350
Will we dodge that?

1386
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:03,880
Reflect with the guns?

1387
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:04,440
I can do that?

1388
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:05,760
I don't think I can do that!

1389
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:08,520
Oh wait.

1390
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:08,880
Hold on.

1391
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:09,940
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move.

1392
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:14,730
Oh god.

1393
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:23,170
At this point I don't feel like I can even jump on him to get any attack and like...

1394
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:24,070
Oh

1395
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:32,920
my god, I thought I was about to die!

1396
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:34,740
Nice!

1397
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:52,050
Oh my god!

1398
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:57,900
Oh gosh.

1399
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,400
My robs!

1400
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:05,340
How rude of you.

1401
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:14,910
Clutch of the century.

1402
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:16,870
Damn, that was so...

1403
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:17,290
Dang.

1404
01:30:20,590 --> 01:30:22,110
Astronomical board.

1405
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:26,010
An astrological device which displays the endless void.

1406
01:30:26,410 --> 01:30:27,630
Said to be powered by time.

1407
01:30:27,830 --> 01:30:29,050
We know where that goes.

1408
01:30:29,230 --> 01:30:29,750
Good job, Binky.

1409
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:35,010
You beat that boss in under 5 tries without crying, farting, or puking.

1410
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:36,050
How do you know I didn't fart?

1411
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:52,230
Not even you can open that door, Dante.

1412
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,900
He's like, I know your game, door.

1413
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:10,340
Lad?

1414
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:15,200
What the hell is this?

1415
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:21,340
His nose has jiggle physics.

1416
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:22,580
No good!

1417
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:23,100
What the heck?

1418
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:34,740
I could have used a trigger warning for this guy.

1419
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:41,980
This place...

1420
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:56,140
Or is that too difficult for you?

1421
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:11,260
Dante is so unserious.

1422
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:26,970
That is what the something is.

1423
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:28,510
Remember that, kid?

1424
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:32,390
Write it down on your hand if you don't trust your head.

1425
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:45,810
I see.

1426
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:47,250
Thanks.

1427
01:32:48,370 --> 01:32:50,410
You still piss me off, though.

1428
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:57,810
I could have used a warning for Jester.

1429
01:32:59,810 --> 01:33:01,210
I have 300 hours in this game.

1430
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:02,850
I never knew you could deflect those.

1431
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:03,230
What?

1432
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:07,410
Thanks for making me learn something new, Mintominkymonkey.

1433
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:08,650
You're welcome.

1434
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:12,930
You guys, we killed it!

1435
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:20,430
We're so awesome!

1436
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:23,650
Nice.

1437
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:25,430
Nice.

1438
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:32,420
Mission 5 of Devils and Swords.

1439
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:35,620
Unleash your might on the demonic gatekeepers.

1440
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:40,080
I just got here.

1441
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:41,240
How was the millipede fight?

1442
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,340
It was okay.

1443
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:46,720
I clutched it, as I always do.

1444
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:50,040
I'm too good!

1445
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:52,480
I'm too good.

1446
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:54,640
Girl boss.

1447
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:55,680
Gaslight.

1448
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:56,540
Gatekeepers.

1449
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:58,900
This game is so cute, isn't it?

1450
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:00,100
It's so cute.

1451
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:01,720
Alright, customize, baby.

1452
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,480
Let's buy some...

1453
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:08,300
Air hike.

1454
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:10,920
And we have enough for something else, maybe.

1455
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:12,900
Not that.

1456
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:14,580
Not that.

1457
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:17,840
Devil Minto cute.

1458
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:20,220
Not that.

1459
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:22,080
That?

1460
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:29,420
Spin the nunchucks around in a propeller-like motion to rapidly slice into the enemy.

1461
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:32,000
R, L, back, X.

1462
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:35,060
Blorb?

1463
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:36,940
How much is a blorb?

1464
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:38,220
I think blorb was...

1465
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,540
10,000?

1466
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:44,440
Yeah, we do not have enough for a blorb.

1467
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:46,300
I guess I can save up for the blorb.

1468
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:48,760
Windmill is alright.

1469
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:53,750
Gun upgrade.

1470
01:34:55,310 --> 01:34:55,750
Maybe.

1471
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:57,990
I think I'll save up for blorb.

1472
01:35:00,230 --> 01:35:02,190
I will probably always need more health.

1473
01:35:04,530 --> 01:35:09,410
It's a bit early, but when you finish the game, I hope you get to see some of the DMC3 combo AMV...

1474
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:10,970
AMV?

1475
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:14,690
It's cheesy fun and shows how nuts Dante can get.

1476
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:16,250
What?

1477
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:19,890
For a new player, yeah, blorb is good.

1478
01:35:19,890 --> 01:35:22,290
I think I should need it.

1479
01:35:22,630 --> 01:35:23,770
Look at that guy.

1480
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:28,890
I like the way the blorb looks though.

1481
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:33,450
This is my interpretation of each orb.

1482
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:42,310
That's how each one would sound.

1483
01:35:45,050 --> 01:35:47,850
Do you even need gold orbs in this game?

1484
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:56,150
I feel like so far, it doesn't restart you at the very beginning of the mission, so it's not so bad.

1485
01:35:59,230 --> 01:36:00,330
Not in gold mode.

1486
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:06,330
That's good then.

1487
01:36:06,490 --> 01:36:08,670
Something we don't have to think about using our orbs on.

1488
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:11,390
Oh wait, what does the orb look like?

1489
01:36:11,550 --> 01:36:12,890
I need to make the orb...

1490
01:36:18,210 --> 01:36:19,490
And then...

1491
01:36:19,490 --> 01:36:20,730
And then...

1492
01:36:20,730 --> 01:36:21,630
And then the vital star...

1493
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:24,890
And the devil star...

1494
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:29,110
Oh wait, the devil star is the orb, but flipped.

1495
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:32,890
So it would make the opposite...

1496
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:38,810
Hey chat, which orb is getting the best head?

1497
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:41,390
The blorb.

1498
01:36:43,850 --> 01:36:44,890
He's ready.

1499
01:36:45,690 --> 01:36:47,270
But I think...

1500
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:49,430
The blorb...

1501
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:52,170
Is also like...

1502
01:36:52,170 --> 01:36:56,750
What is your favorite color flavor?

1503
01:36:58,650 --> 01:37:01,270
I think the blorb looks really delicious.

1504
01:37:01,770 --> 01:37:03,010
I love blue flavor.

1505
01:37:03,850 --> 01:37:04,970
But actually I think...

1506
01:37:04,970 --> 01:37:07,130
Blue flavor might be my favorite flavor.

1507
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:13,180
Binto sound effects pack mod win.

1508
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:15,680
Where did Binto come from?

1509
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,140
Oh, what did I do?

1510
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:18,880
Oh, I went to...

1511
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:20,940
Ebony and Ivory.

1512
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:23,940
I can't stop yawning.

1513
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:24,980
I'm sorry guys.

1514
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:27,040
Okay.

1515
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:29,560
Blorb is pogging.

1516
01:37:49,710 --> 01:37:50,850
Red flavor.

1517
01:37:52,350 --> 01:37:53,490
Now we're buddies!

1518
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:56,450
Wait...

1519
01:37:56,450 --> 01:37:57,530
We're buddies!

1520
01:37:57,650 --> 01:37:58,110
We're buddies!

1521
01:37:58,990 --> 01:38:00,730
The worst boss in the game?

1522
01:38:01,130 --> 01:38:01,610
Really?

1523
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:04,450
Like in terms of just...

1524
01:38:04,450 --> 01:38:05,770
How...

1525
01:38:05,770 --> 01:38:06,750
Not fun it is?

1526
01:38:12,650 --> 01:38:14,970
I was expecting something a little better from this.

1527
01:38:19,540 --> 01:38:20,320
What's that thing?

1528
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:23,380
S?

1529
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,080
Oh, why am I...

1530
01:38:32,710 --> 01:38:36,380
Come on!

1531
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:36,700
Come on!

1532
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:37,860
What am

1533
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:43,980
I...Oh my goodness, they hit hard.

1534
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,040
Oh gosh!

1535
01:38:51,490 --> 01:38:53,890
Oh, is that because we're in mission 5 or whatever?

1536
01:38:54,390 --> 01:38:56,930
Isn't there one hidden in every level?

1537
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:58,110
I remember now.

1538
01:38:58,390 --> 01:38:59,970
But I forgot to look for it before.

1539
01:39:03,730 --> 01:39:05,510
Wait, I have air hike now, right?

1540
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:08,910
Oh my gosh, stop!

1541
01:39:10,450 --> 01:39:11,550
Oh, they're fast.

1542
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:12,310
They're fast!

1543
01:39:12,370 --> 01:39:12,870
They're fast!

1544
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,960
Am I gonna die to these birds?

1545
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:25,420
That would be really unfortunate if I did.

1546
01:39:34,390 --> 01:39:35,830
Let her figure it out.

1547
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:37,470
Uh-oh, am I missing something?

1548
01:39:37,990 --> 01:39:39,050
Oh, I died!

1549
01:39:45,150 --> 01:39:46,970
Were they actually multiplying?

1550
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:57,950
Oh no, go on him.

1551
01:40:04,530 --> 01:40:06,830
And do I...

1552
01:40:06,830 --> 01:40:07,810
Oh wait, not that.

1553
01:40:08,330 --> 01:40:09,810
Wait, not that, my bad.

1554
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:12,690
Oh, it eventually comes back to life.

1555
01:40:12,690 --> 01:40:12,970
Okay.

1556
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:16,210
Oh shoot, no, no, stop!

1557
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:17,010
Stop it!

1558
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:18,430
Come on, I'm trying to figure it out.

1559
01:40:18,830 --> 01:40:18,970
Ah!

1560
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:22,030
I did kill him!

1561
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:23,650
I think?

1562
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:25,150
Wait, actually I'm not sure.

1563
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:42,410
Is there another guy?

1564
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:43,510
Oh, there is!

1565
01:40:47,470 --> 01:40:48,730
Oh, there's tons of them.

1566
01:40:51,190 --> 01:40:51,890
Ah, shoot.

1567
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,740
Oh my god, no, this guy.

1568
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:00,560
Right here?

1569
01:41:04,820 --> 01:41:06,520
Nice, got him right before.

1570
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:07,740
Oh, what is he doing?

1571
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:11,840
Can I change to you?

1572
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:12,520
Thank you.

1573
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:17,580
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you.

1574
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:22,520
Gosh, they unfreeze so fast.

1575
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:37,000
They split apart.

1576
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:39,860
Yeah, I'm very much seeing that.

1577
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:45,560
Ah!

1578
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:48,640
Ah, jeez.

1579
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:50,920
Jeez louise.

1580
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:55,120
Finally.

1581
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:56,420
Is there anything else in here?

1582
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:59,520
Oh wait, this is where our little guy was.

1583
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:01,980
It won't let us go the other way.

1584
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:05,800
What's this?

1585
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:06,800
Hello?

1586
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:17,930
Enter it like a door.

1587
01:42:18,190 --> 01:42:19,930
Oh, so I actually like...

1588
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:25,180
No!

1589
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:30,820
Oh no!

1590
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:33,980
Oh god.

1591
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:38,260
Oh god.

1592
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:41,680
That's so cute!

1593
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:50,190
Oh, what is that?

1594
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:17,980
Oh god.

1595
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:20,020
Oh god.

1596
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:23,890
Right in the balls!

1597
01:43:25,870 --> 01:43:32,270
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy.

1598
01:43:34,670 --> 01:43:35,170
Oh.

1599
01:43:37,650 --> 01:43:38,450
Oh, again.

1600
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:39,230
Please.

1601
01:43:40,110 --> 01:43:40,970
More balls!

1602
01:43:46,950 --> 01:43:48,470
Too many balls.

1603
01:43:51,850 --> 01:43:53,250
Can I hit these at him?

1604
01:43:53,290 --> 01:43:54,110
I don't want to try though.

1605
01:43:57,890 --> 01:44:02,090
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy.

1606
01:44:04,710 --> 01:44:05,230
I

1607
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:12,760
don't know if I'm doing this correctly, but...

1608
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:13,560
It's kind of silly.

1609
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:17,620
Oh gosh, there's... Oh no, no!

1610
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:18,340
So many balls!

1611
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:19,760
Too many balls!

1612
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:31,000
We do big damage with this though.

1613
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:35,460
Nice.

1614
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:36,660
Okay.

1615
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:37,940
More balls.

1616
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:39,580
Oh, three balls!

1617
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:42,060
What are the green ones?

1618
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,040
What are the green ones special for?

1619
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:02,180
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy.

1620
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:15,000
Oh my god.

1621
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:15,960
Ouchie, ouchie, ouchie, ouchie.

1622
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:17,960
My name.

1623
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:20,860
Holy...My name!

1624
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:23,960
Holy, holy, holy, holy...

1625
01:45:31,670 --> 01:45:32,810
Cool name.

1626
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:44,380
I'll take it.

1627
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:50,380
What the hell was that?

1628
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:52,220
Welcome back to my membership!

1629
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:53,660
Thank you!

1630
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:54,880
Thank you Angel Wings!

1631
01:45:54,880 --> 01:46:00,340
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy...

1632
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:00,540
Okay.

1633
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:05,880
We got the thing that we put...

1634
01:46:09,380 --> 01:46:10,880
Onto the clock.

1635
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:15,260
Freak off.

1636
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:16,600
I would win.

1637
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:21,320
The robes returned.

1638
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:24,180
How kind.

1639
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:26,860
That's cool.

1640
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,300
Thank you so much for the gift.

1641
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:30,020
Another gift.

1642
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:30,800
Thank you.

1643
01:46:37,290 --> 01:46:39,890
I would...Oh wow, there is one down there.

1644
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:41,910
You see it?

1645
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:43,870
Do you see it?

1646
01:46:45,170 --> 01:46:46,570
Do you see it?

1647
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:51,510
I didn't know you had a cameo in this game.

1648
01:46:52,270 --> 01:46:54,950
Holy, holy, holy, holy...

1649
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:57,390
Use the astronomical board.

1650
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:02,740
What is it doing?

1651
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:11,860
What

1652
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:16,640
does that mean?

1653
01:47:20,990 --> 01:47:22,050
What does that mean?

1654
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:29,990
Where was the roar?

1655
01:47:31,230 --> 01:47:32,230
Is it further down?

1656
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:39,620
Jump on?

1657
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:40,100
It's funny?

1658
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:40,580
Okay.

1659
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:41,900
Here I go!

1660
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:52,320
Roar!

1661
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:07,540
The devil, devil, devil trampoline.

1662
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:08,780
Let's go.

1663
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:09,640
Nice.

1664
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:10,480
Okay, okay, okay.

1665
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:12,200
And...roar.

1666
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:12,240
Roar.

1667
01:48:15,340 --> 01:48:16,300
And roar.

1668
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:16,960
And roar.

1669
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:19,280
And more roar.

1670
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:22,680
Perfect.

1671
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:31,160
Oh yeah, the thing that had...I was like, I've already lost the sauce.

1672
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:32,520
Or lost the plot.

1673
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,640
I was...

1674
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:39,720
Getting the wall that came down.

1675
01:48:40,350 --> 01:48:42,320
Was it over this right here?

1676
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:45,280
Lost in the sauce.

1677
01:48:46,490 --> 01:48:47,520
We got a fork!

1678
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:08,230
Say it.

1679
01:49:09,650 --> 01:49:10,650
The Vajurra.

1680
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:18,070
We got the Vajurra.

1681
01:49:20,010 --> 01:49:21,210
Glad to catch the stream.

1682
01:49:21,330 --> 01:49:22,250
Hope you feel much better.

1683
01:49:22,710 --> 01:49:24,150
Boss, good luck and have fun.

1684
01:49:24,290 --> 01:49:26,110
Thank you, Neo Cerberus.

1685
01:49:26,210 --> 01:49:27,810
Oh, I almost said Cerberus.

1686
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:28,910
Ceribus.

1687
01:49:31,370 --> 01:49:34,870
I almost said, I almost said, I was like Cerberus.

1688
01:49:36,290 --> 01:49:38,630
Whoa, Panzer, thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

1689
01:49:39,310 --> 01:49:41,550
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1690
01:49:41,670 --> 01:49:42,530
I appreciate it.

1691
01:49:43,770 --> 01:49:46,490
Model of an ancient weapon used to control lightning.

1692
01:49:46,490 --> 01:49:48,470
This is merely an ornament.

1693
01:49:50,110 --> 01:49:51,850
Control lightning, eh?

1694
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:57,300
Was it this door?

1695
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:04,340
I need more health.

1696
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:13,140
I guess we're okay.

1697
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:22,420
I don't know why I shot.

1698
01:50:23,020 --> 01:50:24,480
Sorry, I'm still thinking up.

1699
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,160
Oh, they come from the walls.

1700
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:32,220
Wow, we're really silent.

1701
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:35,120
I like

1702
01:50:47,530 --> 01:50:49,230
that we can get this one from backwards too.

1703
01:50:49,930 --> 01:50:50,650
It's nice.

1704
01:50:50,870 --> 01:50:51,830
Oh no, no, no, don't disappear.

1705
01:50:52,370 --> 01:50:53,230
I lost it.

1706
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:01,080
I don't know the combos for this.

1707
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:01,520
Hold on.

1708
01:51:05,420 --> 01:51:05,960
File.

1709
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:09,120
Devil Arms.

1710
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:11,820
Cerberus.

1711
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:13,960
So it was...

1712
01:51:14,740 --> 01:51:15,760
Just a bunch of X's.

1713
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:17,760
X, X.

1714
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:19,380
Okay, X, X, pause.

1715
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:20,640
X, X.

1716
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:23,600
And then the rebellion one was X, pause, X.

1717
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:24,160
Oh my gosh.

1718
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:24,840
Okay.

1719
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:28,060
Gosh, I don't... You can tell I don't play fighting games.

1720
01:51:28,820 --> 01:51:29,680
X midair.

1721
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:33,180
X won't go... Oh, target and X forward.

1722
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:33,880
Okay, that's right.

1723
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:35,380
Okay, I got a target more.

1724
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:42,940
They're not gonna respawn, are they?

1725
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:53,320
Revolver.

1726
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,120
Dante.

1727
01:51:55,580 --> 01:51:56,220
Here we go.

1728
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,740
Oh, my bad.

1729
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:00,980
Use the Majura.

1730
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:01,060
Majura.

1731
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:06,220
Not so violently, Dante!

1732
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:09,480
Oh my gosh.

1733
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:11,460
Sky.

1734
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:15,400
He has not a sensitive bone in his body.

1735
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:25,120
We got the Soul of Steel.

1736
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:29,300
That's what it talked about.

1737
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:31,840
The essence of a powerful and fearless soul.

1738
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:35,120
Its possessor need not fear hell nor oblivion.

1739
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:36,740
Nice.

1740
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:38,040
Oh, not nice.

1741
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:40,640
Let me scratch my nose first.

1742
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:53,810
Okay, wait, where are these guys?

1743
01:53:02,190 --> 01:53:03,150
Oh my god, please.

1744
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:07,980
Let's just kill this guy first.

1745
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:18,560
Somehow.

1746
01:53:30,950 --> 01:53:31,750
Who's yelling?

1747
01:53:37,230 --> 01:53:38,650
I think I killed it.

1748
01:53:39,010 --> 01:53:39,350
Nice.

1749
01:53:39,950 --> 01:53:41,750
Oh, can I lock on to you, please?

1750
01:53:43,450 --> 01:53:44,630
Come on, come on.

1751
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:45,390
There we go.

1752
01:53:46,890 --> 01:53:47,430
Breakdown.

1753
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:51,800
Nice.

1754
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:53,120
Grab my robes.

1755
01:53:55,940 --> 01:53:57,620
Thanks for meeting me.

1756
01:53:59,020 --> 01:54:00,340
I appreciate it.

1757
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:01,780
Thank you for coming down here.

1758
01:54:03,180 --> 01:54:03,980
Ouchie.

1759
01:54:07,690 --> 01:54:09,450
Can you die already?

1760
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:20,780
I almost missed the stairs.

1761
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:26,500
Oh gosh, why do I always have to fall?

1762
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:34,920
I keep falling.

1763
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:35,060
Thanks.

1764
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:42,500
Oh, shut up door.

1765
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:48,580
This guy is just chilling all by himself up here.

1766
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:50,760
Is that the last one?

1767
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:56,000
Million stab is just for sunlocking a style point.

1768
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:58,780
Yeah, I was styling on them.

1769
01:54:59,980 --> 01:55:01,880
A lot, probably too much.

1770
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,040
They were like dead dead, but I just like to show them who's boss.

1771
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:08,460
That's why the other guys die so fast, because they are cowering in fear.

1772
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:13,680
Styling.

1773
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,820
So we got this thing.

1774
01:55:21,020 --> 01:55:22,220
This idle animation.

1775
01:55:22,420 --> 01:55:23,820
He becomes Sonic the Hedgehog.

1776
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:28,900
We got the soul.

1777
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:29,880
What do we do with this thing?

1778
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:34,800
How do I see what the mission is?

1779
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:42,080
Does the map tell me the mission?

1780
01:55:42,260 --> 01:55:42,360
No.

1781
01:55:43,940 --> 01:55:44,560
The stole.

1782
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:45,680
Yeah, we got the stole.

1783
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:54,360
Walk across the gap.

1784
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:56,580
Does file work?

1785
01:55:56,720 --> 01:55:58,280
No, or...

1786
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,280
No, it doesn't have a...

1787
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:04,840
They told you to steal that?

1788
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:05,700
Oh, that's right.

1789
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:06,760
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1790
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:08,020
The writing on the wall.

1791
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:10,780
The literal writing on the wall.

1792
01:56:11,380 --> 01:56:13,000
Wait, wrong way.

1793
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:14,340
Wait, right way?

1794
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:17,520
Right way.

1795
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:30,700
Oh, thank goodness for giving me...

1796
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:32,680
Oh, dang it.

1797
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:34,940
Should have parried that.

1798
01:56:43,010 --> 01:56:45,570
Dante and Sonic the Hedgehog are distant relatives.

1799
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:47,570
My uncle works at Nintendo.

1800
01:56:48,450 --> 01:56:50,410
I just realized how soon until your concert.

1801
01:56:50,570 --> 01:56:50,830
Good luck.

1802
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:51,910
Thank you!

1803
01:56:52,810 --> 01:56:54,530
I'm so nervous, you guys.

1804
01:56:54,650 --> 01:56:55,550
I might throw up.

1805
01:56:57,550 --> 01:57:01,430
I'm so nervous for the concert!

1806
01:57:04,310 --> 01:57:05,690
I don't want to think about it.

1807
01:57:06,670 --> 01:57:08,850
Let's go take our little...

1808
01:57:09,670 --> 01:57:10,610
This guy.

1809
01:57:13,130 --> 01:57:13,810
Bang!

1810
01:57:15,610 --> 01:57:16,290
Nice.

1811
01:57:16,990 --> 01:57:18,190
Was it this door?

1812
01:57:23,860 --> 01:57:24,840
Astral Chamber?

1813
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:25,780
Oh, no.

1814
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:28,200
Which way was it?

1815
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:33,880
Next door up?

1816
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:37,100
The

1817
01:57:48,170 --> 01:57:49,450
door over here.

1818
01:57:55,870 --> 01:57:58,010
I like the angle there.

1819
01:57:58,050 --> 01:57:58,650
It's really cool.

1820
01:58:00,610 --> 01:58:02,170
Is it...

1821
01:58:02,170 --> 01:58:04,070
Am I silly?

1822
01:58:04,890 --> 01:58:06,050
One floor down.

1823
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:14,000
I'm stealing my soul!

1824
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:19,740
Will it work?

1825
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:22,160
Maybe...hold on.

1826
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:24,440
I'm stealing my soul!

1827
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:30,820
There's more where this came from if you throw up on Doki.

1828
01:58:36,030 --> 01:58:36,110
Ah!

1829
01:58:48,980 --> 01:58:51,900
Use the stole...I keep saying stole.

1830
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:56,340
Use the soul of steel!

1831
01:58:58,320 --> 01:58:59,240
The statue?

1832
01:58:59,420 --> 01:59:00,260
Yeah, I'll get it.

1833
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:03,860
Don't worry, I see it.

1834
01:59:04,620 --> 01:59:06,420
I don't know what it is, but...

1835
01:59:06,420 --> 01:59:08,760
Oh, I am the combat...

1836
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:11,340
Oh, only a technique?

1837
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:11,660
OK.

1838
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:15,840
Oh, that's right.

1839
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:17,120
I have to do like a cool...

1840
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:24,220
Wait, how many pauses was it?

1841
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:26,560
XX pause XX?

1842
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:27,520
Right?

1843
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:30,080
XX pause XX!

1844
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:33,500
XX pause XX!

1845
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:33,760
XX!

1846
01:59:57,090 --> 01:59:58,290
Oh, it's melee.

1847
01:59:58,690 --> 02:00:00,230
Oh, you're right.

1848
02:00:01,070 --> 02:00:01,610
Sorry.

1849
02:00:09,130 --> 02:00:09,670
Blast?

1850
02:00:12,090 --> 02:00:13,250
Oh, turn around?

1851
02:00:14,090 --> 02:00:15,490
No, I lost my combo!

1852
02:00:15,810 --> 02:00:16,530
Hold on, I have to get up.

1853
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:17,170
There we go.

1854
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:31,300
XX pause XX!

1855
02:00:46,030 --> 02:00:49,370
You can't use sword here, because it said only icy.

1856
02:00:50,930 --> 02:00:51,710
Come on!

1857
02:00:51,930 --> 02:00:52,310
Come on!

1858
02:00:53,530 --> 02:00:54,590
So close!

1859
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:55,250
Come on!

1860
02:00:56,890 --> 02:00:57,450
Finally!

1861
02:00:57,990 --> 02:00:58,850
Goodness gracious.

1862
02:01:00,650 --> 02:01:00,990
Yay!

1863
02:01:02,690 --> 02:01:06,090
If you get nervous at the concert, just imagine...

1864
02:01:07,010 --> 02:01:08,370
Everyone in their underwear.

1865
02:01:09,030 --> 02:01:10,210
And the men as minotaurs.

1866
02:01:10,390 --> 02:01:11,290
And the girls boneless.

1867
02:01:13,490 --> 02:01:15,450
We got a full blow!

1868
02:01:17,870 --> 02:01:18,430
Nice.

1869
02:01:18,670 --> 02:01:19,350
Alright.

1870
02:01:20,670 --> 02:01:21,890
Alright, back to sword.

1871
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:25,530
Surge of Fortunas.

1872
02:01:34,440 --> 02:01:37,200
The little children are laughing at me.

1873
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:40,220
Wait, what do I... What's this one?

1874
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:41,780
Oh!

1875
02:01:44,780 --> 02:01:46,820
Defeat all enemies while taking no damage?

1876
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:48,580
Get me out of here!

1877
02:01:48,660 --> 02:01:49,580
I don't want to do this!

1878
02:01:50,060 --> 02:01:51,120
Oh screw this.

1879
02:01:51,180 --> 02:01:51,980
No, come on man.

1880
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:53,180
I don't want to do this.

1881
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:53,440
No!

1882
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:03,040
Exit speedrun maybe?

1883
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:09,800
Thank you so much for the...

1884
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:09,880
Yay!

1885
02:02:15,570 --> 02:02:17,050
I think I'm good.

1886
02:02:17,710 --> 02:02:18,790
Nobody saw that right?

1887
02:02:19,690 --> 02:02:20,230
Anyway...

1888
02:02:23,890 --> 02:02:25,290
What would Jeff do?

1889
02:02:27,710 --> 02:02:29,690
You guys sure seem to like Jeff!

1890
02:02:33,590 --> 02:02:34,830
Zaki, thanks for the gift!

1891
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:38,450
Oh no!

1892
02:02:38,450 --> 02:02:39,890
Oh god!

1893
02:02:40,050 --> 02:02:41,510
I was going to say, are we going to get...

1894
02:02:41,510 --> 02:02:44,690
I was literally about to say, are we about to get ambushed on the elevator?

1895
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:46,790
God dammit.

1896
02:02:48,110 --> 02:02:48,910
No, please!

1897
02:02:49,250 --> 02:02:50,370
Please don't fall off!

1898
02:02:56,220 --> 02:02:57,260
Stupid skellies!

1899
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:58,740
You assholes!

1900
02:02:59,340 --> 02:03:00,620
Ruined my ride!

1901
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:04,440
I tried to parry.

1902
02:03:05,100 --> 02:03:06,180
I was weak.

1903
02:03:07,860 --> 02:03:09,720
Anyway, my god.

1904
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:13,760
Oh, I have to do it again.

1905
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:17,680
I

1906
02:03:21,540 --> 02:03:22,840
think they'll respawn?

1907
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:23,900
I sure hope not.

1908
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:27,660
Okay, anyway.

1909
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:40,240
Yeah, go away.

1910
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:42,920
I'm not even going to get my rorbs.

1911
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:58,160
Literal lazy bones.

1912
02:03:59,160 --> 02:04:00,120
Ouch!

1913
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:06,280
My rorbs!

1914
02:04:06,680 --> 02:04:08,760
All my rorbs!

1915
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:12,000
All my rorbs.

1916
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:14,080
So sad.

1917
02:04:16,220 --> 02:04:20,640
Where are we?

1918
02:04:21,700 --> 02:04:22,600
Invisible wall.

1919
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:25,800
My money.

1920
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:33,680
Is there... I asked this earlier and if someone said I didn't see it, is there a way to...

1921
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:36,620
Is there a way to see what the mission is?

1922
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:41,020
Nice view.

1923
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:53,480
At the statue.

1924
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:54,620
Save?

1925
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:56,000
Oh, save to see your current mission.

1926
02:04:56,120 --> 02:04:56,560
Okay, perfect.

1927
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:08,280
It didn't say.

1928
02:05:10,540 --> 02:05:11,680
It didn't say.

1929
02:05:13,780 --> 02:05:15,400
Mission is to go to the top of the tower.

1930
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:17,780
Thanks for the membership.

1931
02:05:18,380 --> 02:05:18,980
A later thanks.

1932
02:05:19,060 --> 02:05:19,320
Sorry.

1933
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:21,040
I'm glad you got one, Jarin.

1934
02:05:24,740 --> 02:05:27,060
Oh, there's a statue right there!

1935
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:27,840
Oh my god.

1936
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:29,680
No way.

1937
02:05:30,380 --> 02:05:33,680
You guys, it was literally right under our nose.

1938
02:05:35,480 --> 02:05:36,860
What can we buy?

1939
02:05:37,900 --> 02:05:39,460
What can we buy?

1940
02:05:51,570 --> 02:05:52,310
Blorb?

1941
02:05:53,050 --> 02:05:54,110
That's a good idea.

1942
02:05:56,290 --> 02:05:58,790
That is a good idea.

1943
02:05:59,870 --> 02:06:00,890
We are blorbing it up.

1944
02:06:03,550 --> 02:06:04,650
Yeah, baby!

1945
02:06:06,030 --> 02:06:06,930
Air hike?

1946
02:06:06,970 --> 02:06:07,890
I already have it.

1947
02:06:10,390 --> 02:06:14,910
If you literally watch two seconds, you see that I have air hike.

1948
02:06:16,490 --> 02:06:17,710
We gotta get blorbed, everybody.

1949
02:06:18,830 --> 02:06:21,010
Next, we'll go for stinger level 2.

1950
02:06:25,330 --> 02:06:27,330
Why is the air hike in red?

1951
02:06:27,790 --> 02:06:28,690
Is it a triple jump?

1952
02:06:30,830 --> 02:06:33,090
Next, we'll go for stinger...

1953
02:06:33,090 --> 02:06:33,910
Number 2!

1954
02:06:38,530 --> 02:06:39,650
Can't stop yawning.

1955
02:06:42,770 --> 02:06:44,370
Oh, because it's already bought.

1956
02:06:44,610 --> 02:06:45,250
I see.

1957
02:06:46,390 --> 02:06:47,490
This looks breakable.

1958
02:06:48,650 --> 02:06:49,330
Nevermind.

1959
02:06:50,090 --> 02:06:50,850
It's quiet.

1960
02:06:52,210 --> 02:06:53,450
Too quiet.

1961
02:06:55,450 --> 02:06:56,390
That's right!

1962
02:06:56,610 --> 02:06:57,730
The gatekeepers!

1963
02:06:59,590 --> 02:07:00,950
The gaslighters!

1964
02:07:01,050 --> 02:07:02,230
The girlbossers!

1965
02:07:02,770 --> 02:07:04,290
The gatekeepers!

1966
02:07:06,850 --> 02:07:09,230
Oh my god, they have tiny, teeny little heads.

1967
02:07:10,190 --> 02:07:11,930
Oh, that's not their body.

1968
02:07:21,030 --> 02:07:23,570
You had all this time.

1969
02:07:32,810 --> 02:07:34,910
They are yappers.

1970
02:07:39,230 --> 02:07:40,250
Wants to go through.

1971
02:07:40,770 --> 02:07:41,310
Got it.

1972
02:07:47,930 --> 02:07:51,230
They are like big...

1973
02:07:54,370 --> 02:07:55,990
Oh shoot!

1974
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:08,070
Nice parry!

1975
02:08:12,140 --> 02:08:14,020
Oh god, not nice parry.

1976
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:07,780
I don't know who I should go after first.

1977
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:09,480
That doesn't sound good.

1978
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:13,160
Oh god, that doesn't sound good.

1979
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:16,040
That

1980
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:22,340
one's down.

1981
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:23,180
I see, I see.

1982
02:09:28,010 --> 02:09:29,330
And now he's down.

1983
02:09:29,650 --> 02:09:30,050
Nice.

1984
02:09:31,670 --> 02:09:32,090
Not

1985
02:09:37,390 --> 02:09:37,690
down.

1986
02:09:37,810 --> 02:09:39,710
I think they are throwing their soul?

1987
02:09:40,010 --> 02:09:41,170
Oh, I can't see anything, please.

1988
02:09:42,110 --> 02:09:43,030
Oh my god, no!

1989
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:43,770
Oh my gosh.

1990
02:09:44,430 --> 02:09:44,970
I'm gonna see!

1991
02:09:46,550 --> 02:09:47,330
It's over.

1992
02:09:49,250 --> 02:09:51,450
Are they... Do they have friendly fire?

1993
02:09:54,830 --> 02:09:55,350
Ouchie!

1994
02:09:55,950 --> 02:09:57,570
Oh, I'm cornered.

1995
02:09:58,510 --> 02:10:04,890
Oh my god, the freaking inverted camera kills me every time!

1996
02:10:12,670 --> 02:10:15,330
Air hike is saving my butt here.

1997
02:10:15,630 --> 02:10:15,830
Oh!

1998
02:10:16,350 --> 02:10:17,530
Until it doesn't.

1999
02:10:20,650 --> 02:10:21,990
Ouch, oh god.

2000
02:10:29,230 --> 02:10:30,670
Oh, they go to this side now.

2001
02:10:34,150 --> 02:10:34,450
Oh god.

2002
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:52,160
Actually good try, thank you.

2003
02:10:54,120 --> 02:10:55,700
Really good try, thank you.

2004
02:10:58,340 --> 02:10:59,760
They are weak to ice damage?

2005
02:11:00,640 --> 02:11:01,780
Say no more.

2006
02:11:02,220 --> 02:11:03,420
Wait, but my air hike!

2007
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:05,460
No, my air hike!

2008
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:15,320
Ok, we are gonna have to...

2009
02:11:15,940 --> 02:11:17,440
We are gonna...

2010
02:11:18,860 --> 02:11:19,900
And then...

2011
02:11:19,900 --> 02:11:21,900
And then we are gonna...

2012
02:11:24,060 --> 02:11:25,900
And then we'll...

2013
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:29,120
Oh, wait.

2014
02:11:32,660 --> 02:11:34,900
Give me a second, I'm gonna go get some more...

2015
02:11:36,120 --> 02:11:36,540
Drink.

2016
02:11:37,940 --> 02:11:39,020
I'm gonna get some more tea.

2017
02:11:39,220 --> 02:11:40,260
I'm starting to get a headache.

2018
02:11:42,980 --> 02:11:44,910
So, I might also make some...

2019
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:46,580
Heat up some spaghetti.

2020
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:49,680
And we might have a slight intermission.

2021
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:51,040
If that's ok.

2022
02:11:52,760 --> 02:11:54,760
Ok, so like my...

2023
02:11:54,760 --> 02:11:57,060
I ate like at a weird time today.

2024
02:11:57,220 --> 02:11:58,260
So I was like, oh shoot.

2025
02:11:58,300 --> 02:11:59,820
I'm gonna get hungry during stream.

2026
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:02,360
So, intermission!

2027
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:05,000
Intermission, but I'll be back.

2028
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:06,100
And then I'll eat my spaghetti.

2029
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:10,040
All good.

2030
02:12:10,540 --> 02:12:12,620
You guys just listen to the...

2031
02:12:12,620 --> 02:12:14,520
Lovely sounds of the wind.

2032
02:12:16,580 --> 02:12:21,140
Lovely sounds of the wind.

2033
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:22,940
BRB.

2034
02:16:16,270 --> 02:16:17,690
Dinner time.

2035
02:16:18,390 --> 02:16:19,050
Hold on.

2036
02:16:19,790 --> 02:16:20,830
Dinner time everybody.

2037
02:16:21,910 --> 02:16:23,650
Dinner time everybody.

2038
02:16:38,180 --> 02:16:39,080
Sorry.

2039
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:41,060
That I have to have my dinner.

2040
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:42,500
Midstream.

2041
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:43,420
Midstream.

2042
02:16:45,020 --> 02:16:45,700
My bad.

2043
02:16:46,700 --> 02:16:47,280
Spaghetti.

2044
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:49,980
I just have some left over spaghetti.

2045
02:16:50,460 --> 02:16:52,500
But, I'm sad because it's like...

2046
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:54,100
Super plain spaghetti.

2047
02:16:54,300 --> 02:16:56,480
I cook my...

2048
02:16:56,480 --> 02:16:59,280
I usually add like a chicken sausage to it.

2049
02:17:00,080 --> 02:17:00,640
And onion.

2050
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:05,420
But I ate all the onion when I had it the first night.

2051
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:07,500
And all the sausage.

2052
02:17:08,540 --> 02:17:10,880
I would have to recook a new sausage and new onion.

2053
02:17:12,560 --> 02:17:14,520
So it's just super plain spaghetti.

2054
02:17:21,860 --> 02:17:23,960
But yeah, are you guys having a good week?

2055
02:17:24,400 --> 02:17:25,120
It's hump day.

2056
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:28,880
It's one day.

2057
02:17:31,180 --> 02:17:33,340
Are you gonna watch the game award show tomorrow?

2058
02:17:36,720 --> 02:17:37,200
Probably...

2059
02:17:37,900 --> 02:17:38,380
Sometime.

2060
02:17:38,580 --> 02:17:39,540
What time is it at?

2061
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:41,480
Tomorrow.

2062
02:17:51,960 --> 02:17:53,840
I just wanna know about Astro Boy.

2063
02:17:54,320 --> 02:17:54,800
Astro Boy.

2064
02:17:54,880 --> 02:17:55,340
Astro Bot.

2065
02:17:58,980 --> 02:18:00,440
8pm EST-ish.

2066
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:03,900
I don't think I'll be able to at the time.

2067
02:18:04,680 --> 02:18:07,660
But if anything interesting happens, you can tag me on Twitter.

2068
02:18:12,780 --> 02:18:14,020
I want to see if Bakura wins.

2069
02:18:14,140 --> 02:18:14,360
Right!

2070
02:18:16,780 --> 02:18:17,220
Right?

2071
02:18:19,420 --> 02:18:20,960
It'll be huge if she does.

2072
02:18:22,300 --> 02:18:23,380
Flying out for Iowa tomorrow.

2073
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:24,080
Excited to see you.

2074
02:18:24,360 --> 02:18:24,900
Let's go!

2075
02:18:29,880 --> 02:18:30,560
Astro Bot.

2076
02:18:33,820 --> 02:18:36,620
Yeah, unfortunately I won't be able to stream it.

2077
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:39,180
Because I will also be headed out.

2078
02:18:42,220 --> 02:18:43,800
To the area.

2079
02:18:45,620 --> 02:18:47,760
Since the concert is this weekend.

2080
02:18:49,060 --> 02:18:49,620
Spank!

2081
02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:51,060
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

2082
02:18:58,180 --> 02:18:59,360
I need a napkin.

2083
02:18:59,360 --> 02:18:59,860
Ugh.

2084
02:19:11,220 --> 02:19:12,980
Astro Boy was originally Adam.

2085
02:19:13,980 --> 02:19:14,540
Adam.

2086
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:20,060
I have tendonitis because of intermission.

2087
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:22,060
Wait, what?

2088
02:19:22,560 --> 02:19:23,300
Like tendonitis.

2089
02:19:26,500 --> 02:19:28,200
Time to pop Okayu's ult.

2090
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:29,080
Mogu mogu mogu.

2091
02:19:30,380 --> 02:19:31,380
At the bar.

2092
02:19:32,140 --> 02:19:36,160
At a bar with half battery another hour before a ride can show up.

2093
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:37,360
Oh wait, at a bar.

2094
02:19:37,580 --> 02:19:38,940
Oh wait, villain, what happened?

2095
02:19:39,420 --> 02:19:40,680
Something happened with your car?

2096
02:19:41,880 --> 02:19:43,620
This is how I thought dinner with Mint would go.

2097
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:45,980
Wait, this is not how I thought dinner with Mint would go.

2098
02:19:46,100 --> 02:19:46,740
What happened?

2099
02:19:50,200 --> 02:19:50,600
Okay.

2100
02:19:51,640 --> 02:19:53,300
His car got stuck in the snow.

2101
02:19:53,880 --> 02:19:54,720
Vtuber did not read.

2102
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:58,240
I was playing the game and the super chat went too fast.

2103
02:19:58,400 --> 02:19:58,720
Oh wait.

2104
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:01,040
The chain broke.

2105
02:20:07,990 --> 02:20:09,130
Engine belt broke.

2106
02:20:09,190 --> 02:20:09,370
Engine belt broke.

2107
02:20:12,270 --> 02:20:15,350
Stop watching stream and call for help.

2108
02:20:20,350 --> 02:20:25,630
Did you know that Ace Combat Dev also go to US military to show it on their official Project Ace account?

2109
02:20:26,130 --> 02:20:28,270
I believe the USS is a secret visit.

2110
02:20:29,650 --> 02:20:30,590
I didn't know.

2111
02:20:30,850 --> 02:20:35,190
Wait, I think I saw you tag me or you send me that on Twitter.

2112
02:20:37,430 --> 02:20:38,930
Get some help.

2113
02:20:42,010 --> 02:20:43,370
It's a joke Minto, don't worry.

2114
02:20:43,830 --> 02:20:47,070
I wasn't worried or anything.

2115
02:20:47,850 --> 02:20:49,850
I wasn't worried or anything.

2116
02:20:50,310 --> 02:20:50,990
What are you talking about?

2117
02:20:51,470 --> 02:20:53,370
Okay, real talk.

2118
02:20:53,470 --> 02:20:55,190
Is there a strat for these guys?

2119
02:20:56,150 --> 02:20:56,950
For the...

2120
02:20:57,670 --> 02:21:00,550
What's the strat for these big bozos?

2121
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:10,100
Tickle them.

2122
02:21:14,610 --> 02:21:15,010
Parry.

2123
02:21:17,710 --> 02:21:19,110
Parry.

2124
02:21:19,810 --> 02:21:21,210
Parry.

2125
02:21:22,130 --> 02:21:23,630
Parry the platypus.

2126
02:21:25,910 --> 02:21:27,810
A platypus.

2127
02:21:28,270 --> 02:21:30,110
Parry the platypus.

2128
02:21:34,490 --> 02:21:35,150
Parry the

2129
02:21:38,540 --> 02:21:39,980
platypus.

2130
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:44,840
Cerberus spam to parry easy.

2131
02:21:45,220 --> 02:21:47,100
I did actually.

2132
02:21:47,220 --> 02:21:48,580
I was getting those parries.

2133
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:52,580
When it was those purple balls.

2134
02:22:00,060 --> 02:22:02,000
I got squirrels in my pants.

2135
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,340
S-I-M-P.

2136
02:22:05,620 --> 02:22:06,960
Squirrels in my pants.

2137
02:22:11,140 --> 02:22:14,100
I like the guy who made...

2138
02:22:14,100 --> 02:22:14,880
What's it called?

2139
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:17,020
Phineas and Ferb.

2140
02:22:17,740 --> 02:22:20,040
The guy that voices the Doofenshmirtzman.

2141
02:22:20,740 --> 02:22:22,380
I see him sometimes on TikTok.

2142
02:22:23,820 --> 02:22:26,440
You guys, if TikTok gets banned...

2143
02:22:26,440 --> 02:22:28,620
You'll never hear me talk about TikTok again.

2144
02:22:32,080 --> 02:22:33,880
My mindless entertainment.

2145
02:22:34,340 --> 02:22:37,300
Actually, I use my TikTok a lot now for like...

2146
02:22:37,300 --> 02:22:39,500
Room inspo and furniture and stuff.

2147
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:41,320
So now I'm like...

2148
02:22:41,320 --> 02:22:43,260
What do I have to do?

2149
02:22:43,300 --> 02:22:45,100
Make a Pinterest for real or something?

2150
02:22:56,070 --> 02:22:58,550
Buff Doofenshmirtz in anime.

2151
02:22:58,730 --> 02:22:59,630
What do you mean by that?

2152
02:22:59,950 --> 02:23:03,430
Are you talking about...

2153
02:23:05,230 --> 02:23:06,130
Dr. Stone?

2154
02:23:12,580 --> 02:23:13,780
Dr. Doofminto.

2155
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:15,460
On their bingo.

2156
02:23:17,220 --> 02:23:18,300
It's almost 2025.

2157
02:23:19,320 --> 02:23:20,940
Gosh, it's almost 2025.

2158
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:23,340
You guys were almost halfway through the month already.

2159
02:23:24,460 --> 02:23:25,400
That's crazy.

2160
02:23:26,460 --> 02:23:27,640
YouTube Shorts is just as good.

2161
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:30,200
Half the stuff is copied from TikTok.

2162
02:23:30,440 --> 02:23:31,120
That's so true.

2163
02:23:45,130 --> 02:23:47,690
You interested in the Soul Reaver 1 and 2 remasters?

2164
02:23:47,850 --> 02:23:49,610
Actually, I kind of am.

2165
02:23:50,050 --> 02:23:51,510
I don't know if I will play them.

2166
02:23:51,510 --> 02:23:54,970
But I was watching a thing...

2167
02:23:55,510 --> 02:23:57,370
About the...

2168
02:23:57,370 --> 02:23:58,990
How they had the...

2169
02:23:59,510 --> 02:24:01,090
The audition tape still.

2170
02:24:02,010 --> 02:24:02,690
For Soul Reaver.

2171
02:24:04,790 --> 02:24:05,990
And how...

2172
02:24:06,650 --> 02:24:08,810
And how like...

2173
02:24:08,810 --> 02:24:11,910
So much of the cast of Metal Gear also auditioned.

2174
02:24:12,810 --> 02:24:15,090
The voice acting in that game is so goaded.

2175
02:24:15,150 --> 02:24:15,790
It's so awesome.

2176
02:24:17,490 --> 02:24:17,930
Hmm.

2177
02:24:27,690 --> 02:24:29,530
Would have been around the same time, yeah, right?

2178
02:24:29,790 --> 02:24:31,350
I'm almost done with my spaghetti, by the way, guys.

2179
02:24:31,390 --> 02:24:31,630
Sorry.

2180
02:24:31,870 --> 02:24:33,510
Thank you for letting me break a little bit.

2181
02:24:42,300 --> 02:24:43,720
But I've never played it before.

2182
02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:50,240
So, it's not off the table.

2183
02:24:51,960 --> 02:24:52,400
But...

2184
02:24:52,400 --> 02:24:58,220
I think I have some other stuff that I want to try first.

2185
02:24:58,660 --> 02:25:00,140
Like, I think...

2186
02:25:02,620 --> 02:25:03,500
I think...

2187
02:25:04,420 --> 02:25:06,500
Indiana Jones shouldn't be so, so long.

2188
02:25:06,720 --> 02:25:08,040
Probably like 2 or 3 more streams.

2189
02:25:08,540 --> 02:25:10,220
And then...

2190
02:25:13,240 --> 02:25:16,720
Thank you, I wasn't planning on attending AWA since I did AMYC this year.

2191
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:20,840
But since tickets for the concert still were on sale, I decided to lock in last minute and just show up for that.

2192
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:21,180
Can't wait.

2193
02:25:21,620 --> 02:25:21,960
What?

2194
02:25:22,040 --> 02:25:22,320
Really?

2195
02:25:22,420 --> 02:25:22,980
Thank you!

2196
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:25,320
There's other stuff too going on.

2197
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:26,920
Have fun.

2198
02:25:30,500 --> 02:25:31,060
Um...

2199
02:25:35,140 --> 02:25:36,260
What's for dinner?

2200
02:25:36,880 --> 02:25:37,200
Dinner?

2201
02:25:37,880 --> 02:25:38,440
Spaghetti.

2202
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:41,560
Spaghetti.

2203
02:25:46,720 --> 02:25:48,280
Duo Villain sub!

2204
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:51,620
Akasupa, stop it!

2205
02:25:52,740 --> 02:25:53,520
No, please.

2206
02:25:53,880 --> 02:25:55,020
Oh my god, there's so many superchats.

2207
02:25:55,060 --> 02:25:55,700
Thank you guys!

2208
02:25:57,100 --> 02:25:59,520
The sounds of the wind in the background are relaxing, right?

2209
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:03,120
I was saying though...

2210
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:05,060
Probably after Indiana Jones...

2211
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:09,640
I know this might be a longer series too, but I think I want to...

2212
02:26:09,640 --> 02:26:12,060
It will be in combination with like...

2213
02:26:13,380 --> 02:26:14,260
You know...

2214
02:26:14,260 --> 02:26:14,940
Devil May Cry.

2215
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:17,880
And like all the series that I've got going on and everything.

2216
02:26:18,360 --> 02:26:20,060
But I think I want to do...

2217
02:26:20,060 --> 02:26:21,840
I want to start... I want to try Nier.

2218
02:26:23,880 --> 02:26:24,320
So...

2219
02:26:25,440 --> 02:26:28,740
Just signed up for my first signed cheque lottery.

2220
02:26:28,740 --> 02:26:30,260
Wait, for who?

2221
02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:31,800
For who?

2222
02:26:34,260 --> 02:26:37,120
Serpentine belt broke, so no heat and engine is melting.

2223
02:26:37,260 --> 02:26:40,220
Made it to a tiny town and have been waiting in a bar for 45 minutes.

2224
02:26:40,300 --> 02:26:42,560
One hour to go with a shitty charger at half charge.

2225
02:26:42,680 --> 02:26:43,740
Water and...

2226
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:45,920
What's that?

2227
02:26:47,420 --> 02:26:48,160
Just slick.

2228
02:26:48,980 --> 02:26:49,700
It's past the time.

2229
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:52,040
Makes me appreciate having streamed with you, so thanks.

2230
02:26:52,540 --> 02:26:57,160
I hope that you get home soon and safe.

2231
02:27:01,120 --> 02:27:04,440
When will memberships be available in the US?

2232
02:27:16,510 --> 02:27:18,290
Have you tried signalist?

2233
02:27:18,330 --> 02:27:19,390
Yeah, I have played that before.

2234
02:27:32,300 --> 02:27:33,620
Replicant or automata?

2235
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:36,400
I haven't done enough research yet.

2236
02:27:40,510 --> 02:27:42,670
So I cannot say which one.

2237
02:27:43,110 --> 02:27:44,710
It also depends on how I feel.

2238
02:27:46,230 --> 02:27:47,710
If I'm like...

2239
02:27:49,570 --> 02:27:51,710
Because one of them is a prequel, right?

2240
02:27:51,810 --> 02:27:52,650
But it's a prequel sequel.

2241
02:27:55,590 --> 02:27:56,730
Replicant is the first game.

2242
02:27:57,010 --> 02:27:57,810
Did it come out first?

2243
02:28:01,150 --> 02:28:01,750
Oh no?

2244
02:28:01,910 --> 02:28:02,310
I'm silly?

2245
02:28:03,630 --> 02:28:04,990
It's a remake of the first one.

2246
02:28:06,950 --> 02:28:08,930
I don't have to play Drakengard, right?

2247
02:28:10,670 --> 02:28:12,670
I guess I'll just miss out on some references.

2248
02:28:21,740 --> 02:28:23,480
It'd be cool though.

2249
02:28:23,700 --> 02:28:24,680
Drakengard is crazy.

2250
02:28:25,900 --> 02:28:27,940
No one should play Drakengard.

2251
02:28:28,500 --> 02:28:32,020
I had a friend who... it was her favorite game series.

2252
02:28:32,880 --> 02:28:34,760
And this is before Nier ever came out.

2253
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:36,520
And I was like, girl...

2254
02:28:44,060 --> 02:28:46,360
You're into some freaky stuff.

2255
02:28:51,090 --> 02:28:53,870
Nier series also made by ex-Ace Combat dev.

2256
02:28:56,210 --> 02:28:58,070
No, I'm with the...

2257
02:28:58,070 --> 02:29:01,430
No matter what, there's an Ace Combat relation.

2258
02:29:01,550 --> 02:29:02,350
It's like, what's it called?

2259
02:29:03,930 --> 02:29:07,290
You know when you have the...

2260
02:29:07,290 --> 02:29:10,010
2 degrees to whatever or something, something.

2261
02:29:11,470 --> 02:29:15,410
I'm 3 degrees away from an Ace Combat reference.

2262
02:29:16,690 --> 02:29:17,690
Or dev or something.

2263
02:29:19,170 --> 02:29:19,990
Kevin Bacon.

2264
02:29:20,670 --> 02:29:22,350
6 degrees of separation.

2265
02:29:22,730 --> 02:29:24,010
It's Kevin Bacon.

2266
02:29:24,670 --> 02:29:26,050
6 degrees of Kevin Bacon.

2267
02:29:26,450 --> 02:29:27,850
7 degrees of Ace Combat.

2268
02:29:33,730 --> 02:29:36,170
What if I just...

2269
02:29:38,110 --> 02:29:40,170
Why won't it let me...

2270
02:29:40,930 --> 02:29:46,490
You can

2271
02:29:54,580 --> 02:29:56,340
play Automata without playing Replicant.

2272
02:29:58,860 --> 02:29:59,380
Yeah.

2273
02:30:00,140 --> 02:30:01,360
I have heard that.

2274
02:30:02,920 --> 02:30:05,280
I just think... I don't want...

2275
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:07,600
Well, I can, you know...

2276
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:08,360
Here's the thing.

2277
02:30:08,620 --> 02:30:09,920
You can never please everybody.

2278
02:30:11,460 --> 02:30:13,280
But I feel like...

2279
02:30:13,280 --> 02:30:16,260
If I don't play Replicant first, people will be like...

2280
02:30:23,700 --> 02:30:24,680
So... I don't know.

2281
02:30:24,680 --> 02:30:26,820
Automata has a lot of Replicant spoilers.

2282
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:29,540
So it's like you either play it or you don't.

2283
02:30:29,660 --> 02:30:30,640
Sounds like it.

2284
02:30:42,900 --> 02:30:46,980
Oh, look at this guy right here.

2285
02:30:47,420 --> 02:30:48,920
And this guy over here.

2286
02:30:50,420 --> 02:30:51,800
Are these all skulls?

2287
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:53,220
I thought it was treasure before.

2288
02:30:57,770 --> 02:30:59,550
Oh, let me get my dinner time away.

2289
02:31:02,670 --> 02:31:03,150
Alright.

2290
02:31:05,790 --> 02:31:06,710
Can you on Twitter?

2291
02:31:06,970 --> 02:31:07,190
Okay.

2292
02:31:08,350 --> 02:31:08,830
Please do.

2293
02:31:09,150 --> 02:31:10,610
I like these guys.

2294
02:31:10,670 --> 02:31:11,330
They are so funny.

2295
02:31:15,110 --> 02:31:17,310
Oh, I do not have... What's it called anymore?

2296
02:31:38,150 --> 02:31:38,950
Oh shoot.

2297
02:31:39,090 --> 02:31:39,630
No parry.

2298
02:32:07,110 --> 02:32:08,070
Oh shoot!

2299
02:32:08,350 --> 02:32:09,010
Oh my god.

2300
02:32:14,940 --> 02:32:15,860
Come here.

2301
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:26,180
Focus in on this guy first maybe.

2302
02:32:45,660 --> 02:32:46,340
Oh wait.

2303
02:32:46,440 --> 02:32:46,900
No, no, no.

2304
02:32:46,960 --> 02:32:47,240
Sorry.

2305
02:32:50,200 --> 02:32:51,040
Oh my god.

2306
02:32:51,100 --> 02:32:51,920
He's almost down.

2307
02:32:52,140 --> 02:32:52,720
Nice!

2308
02:33:08,100 --> 02:33:08,680
Oh

2309
02:33:21,480 --> 02:33:22,060
gosh.

2310
02:33:22,160 --> 02:33:23,840
Give me a second to like...

2311
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:25,600
Oh gosh.

2312
02:33:25,860 --> 02:33:26,880
Oh my god!

2313
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:28,000
Oh big!

2314
02:33:28,180 --> 02:33:28,560
Big!

2315
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:29,160
Big!

2316
02:33:29,300 --> 02:33:29,680
Big!

2317
02:33:29,820 --> 02:33:30,020
Big!

2318
02:33:30,120 --> 02:33:30,720
Big!

2319
02:33:31,020 --> 02:33:31,300
Big!

2320
02:33:31,300 --> 02:33:32,220
Big damage!

2321
02:33:41,260 --> 02:33:41,860
Dodge!

2322
02:33:41,960 --> 02:33:42,140
Dodge!

2323
02:33:42,240 --> 02:33:42,340
Dodge!

2324
02:34:02,370 --> 02:34:04,170
That was impressive though.

2325
02:34:04,210 --> 02:34:04,650
Holy crap.

2326
02:34:04,750 --> 02:34:05,470
Thank you!

2327
02:34:08,750 --> 02:34:09,350
Alright.

2328
02:34:09,930 --> 02:34:10,590
My buddy.

2329
02:34:33,030 --> 02:34:33,810
Oh shoot.

2330
02:34:36,070 --> 02:34:36,670
Move!

2331
02:34:36,770 --> 02:34:36,830
Move!

2332
02:34:36,930 --> 02:34:37,050
Move!

2333
02:34:37,070 --> 02:34:37,550
No, alright.

2334
02:34:41,790 --> 02:34:42,390
Okay.

2335
02:34:57,180 --> 02:34:57,660
Nice!

2336
02:34:58,220 --> 02:34:58,700
Nice!

2337
02:34:59,240 --> 02:34:59,580
Nice!

2338
02:35:00,300 --> 02:35:01,240
Take it down!

2339
02:35:02,440 --> 02:35:03,380
You jerk!

2340
02:35:06,440 --> 02:35:06,920
Dodge!

2341
02:35:11,250 --> 02:35:11,250
Dodge!

2342
02:35:11,390 --> 02:35:11,570
Dodge!

2343
02:35:11,890 --> 02:35:12,330
Dodge!

2344
02:35:14,770 --> 02:35:18,950
Wait, can I get back on... Oh I did not realize he was down this entire time.

2345
02:35:19,270 --> 02:35:20,170
That's so disappointing.

2346
02:35:20,590 --> 02:35:21,670
Oh, I could've gotten him!

2347
02:35:23,290 --> 02:35:24,510
Wait, let me get the other guy.

2348
02:35:24,750 --> 02:35:24,990
Oh!

2349
02:35:25,170 --> 02:35:26,330
I keep missing my chances!

2350
02:35:29,970 --> 02:35:30,630
Oh my god.

2351
02:35:31,930 --> 02:35:32,330
I'm

2352
02:35:44,160 --> 02:35:44,560
fine.

2353
02:35:44,820 --> 02:35:45,560
I can't see anything.

2354
02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:49,200
Please!

2355
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:53,240
Oh

2356
02:35:59,220 --> 02:35:59,800
my god.

2357
02:35:59,900 --> 02:36:00,200
Please.

2358
02:36:00,440 --> 02:36:00,840
Oh my god.

2359
02:36:00,940 --> 02:36:01,340
No, no, no.

2360
02:36:01,380 --> 02:36:02,060
I can't see anything.

2361
02:36:02,700 --> 02:36:03,220
I can't see.

2362
02:36:10,970 --> 02:36:12,670
Time for big damage though.

2363
02:36:12,670 --> 02:36:12,830
Oh my god.

2364
02:36:33,860 --> 02:36:35,080
Big damage!

2365
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:36,180
Big damage!

2366
02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:37,140
Big damage!

2367
02:36:42,780 --> 02:36:43,560
Do

2368
02:36:53,660 --> 02:36:56,120
I just jump those?

2369
02:36:56,240 --> 02:36:58,080
Do I just jump to avoid those?

2370
02:37:00,100 --> 02:37:01,960
So close again.

2371
02:37:11,770 --> 02:37:13,350
I dodged too early.

2372
02:37:13,350 --> 02:37:13,450
See?

2373
02:37:16,150 --> 02:37:17,590
Jumping got the iframes.

2374
02:37:17,730 --> 02:37:17,830
Okay.

2375
02:37:19,450 --> 02:37:23,350
It's cause I get, you know, into like the...

2376
02:37:28,310 --> 02:37:30,270
Oh, I dodged again too early.

2377
02:37:32,470 --> 02:37:33,590
Speaking of...

2378
02:37:36,780 --> 02:37:38,660
Maybe we'll go after this guy first.

2379
02:37:40,920 --> 02:37:41,540
You know what?

2380
02:37:43,800 --> 02:37:44,360
Nice.

2381
02:37:46,540 --> 02:37:46,880
Oh wait.

2382
02:37:47,020 --> 02:37:47,740
When did I switch?

2383
02:37:49,180 --> 02:37:50,260
When did I switch?

2384
02:37:54,480 --> 02:37:55,440
I was

2385
02:38:12,650 --> 02:38:13,650
going after you first.

2386
02:38:15,190 --> 02:38:16,050
Oh my god.

2387
02:38:16,750 --> 02:38:17,590
He's already down.

2388
02:38:18,470 --> 02:38:19,430
Oh, they're both down.

2389
02:38:21,090 --> 02:38:21,870
You know what?

2390
02:38:21,950 --> 02:38:23,190
Let's just get them both down.

2391
02:38:23,770 --> 02:38:26,390
So that it should be easier to kill one of them.

2392
02:38:27,150 --> 02:38:27,290
You know?

2393
02:38:27,370 --> 02:38:27,970
Oh shoot!

2394
02:38:31,450 --> 02:38:32,450
Let's do this.

2395
02:38:32,970 --> 02:38:37,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2396
02:38:37,790 --> 02:38:38,590
There we go.

2397
02:38:39,070 --> 02:38:39,390
Okay.

2398
02:38:48,490 --> 02:38:50,310
Okay, now we're gonna focus on him.

2399
02:38:52,890 --> 02:38:54,430
Now we focus on him?

2400
02:39:00,660 --> 02:39:01,180
Oh no, no!

2401
02:39:01,420 --> 02:39:01,920
You, you, you.

2402
02:39:01,940 --> 02:39:02,360
No, no, no.

2403
02:39:06,260 --> 02:39:07,640
You focus on you?

2404
02:39:12,260 --> 02:39:12,740
Okay.

2405
02:39:24,900 --> 02:39:26,940
Nice parry

2406
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:43,830
I didn't even get to...

2407
02:39:56,190 --> 02:39:59,090
That was stupid

2408
02:40:04,610 --> 02:40:06,070
Rachel, thanks for the 5 gifted

2409
02:40:09,270 --> 02:40:18,510
No, they are so funny No

2410
02:40:35,950 --> 02:40:38,650
Impressive No talking!

2411
02:40:45,490 --> 02:40:47,730
Let them speak!

2412
02:40:48,050 --> 02:40:52,090
Let Agni and Rudra speak!

2413
02:40:52,390 --> 02:40:54,150
Let my little yappers yap!

2414
02:40:54,350 --> 02:41:01,650
I love them Agni and Rudra are dragons from the Breath of Fire series.

2415
02:41:01,750 --> 02:41:05,910
Also made by Capcom Yomito, how are you liking DMC3?

2416
02:41:06,190 --> 02:41:07,190
I love it!

2417
02:41:07,290 --> 02:41:08,150
So much fun!

2418
02:41:09,890 --> 02:41:17,950
Blazed with serrated edges that hurl forth fire and tornado-like gusts You can equip when you start a mission...

2419

02:41:56,130 --> 02:41:58,690
But actually that's fine Oh, my bad

2422
02:42:03,090 --> 02:42:05,650
Actually, the exit should be the end of it, right?

This should be the end of it What's my... Ok, my health is...

That's ok though Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

2435
02:42:54,660 --> 02:42:55,700
Exiting the screen.

2436
02:42:56,240 --> 02:43:00,720

2440
02:43:28,080 --> 02:43:30,180
I think I was gonna call it there

2441
02:43:37,360 --> 02:43:39,700
Let's finish with a little eye candy, huh?

2442
02:43:39,940 --> 02:43:45,360
Oh my god, her skirt is so short So short!

2443
02:43:46,540 --> 02:43:55,420
But I love skirts with, like, biker shorts under This peak is so cute

2444
02:43:58,480 --> 02:44:00,500
Easy is for noobs, ya scrub.

2445
02:44:00,580 --> 02:44:02,060
That's why I'm not on easy!

2446
02:44:03,960 --> 02:44:12,120
I'm actually really glad that I didn't switch to easy Because even though the bosses take me, like, a couple tries...

2447
02:44:14,040 --> 02:44:23,120
They're not... They haven't been unreasonable, you know I feel like if I had been on easy I would have just been like, eh, whatever

2448
02:44:28,610 --> 02:44:29,950
Oh my god.

2449
02:44:30,030 --> 02:44:31,030
Damn, girl!

2450
02:44:32,750 --> 02:44:33,850
She's so awesome

2451
02:44:44,480 --> 02:44:47,220
Look at her skirt, it's so cute!

2452
02:44:47,780 --> 02:44:48,120

2453
02:44:52,460 --> 02:44:53,380
Hey, is that lady?

2454

Are you ready?

2455
02:44:55,040 --> 02:44:56,000
That's lady!

2456
02:44:57,200 --> 02:44:59,280
Clear the trial and forge a new path.

2457
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:03,200
Family ties Interesting.

2458
02:45:03,440 --> 02:45:05,040
How much money we got?

2459
02:45:06,900 --> 02:45:07,540
7000.

2460
02:45:07,800 --> 02:45:11,600
Not a lot Not a lot Not a lot of money

2461
02:45:15,710 --> 02:45:17,230
Oh wait, that's not what I meant.

2462
02:45:17,530 --> 02:45:18,130
Action

2463
02:45:22,270 --> 02:45:22,870
Jetstream?

2464
02:45:23,250 --> 02:45:25,330
Wait, they also have air hike!

2465
02:45:25,490 --> 02:45:27,090
Oh my god, it's 20000 though

2466
02:45:30,270 --> 02:45:33,590
This is what max level gunslinger looks like

2467
02:45:36,990 --> 02:45:37,590
Jetstream.

2468
02:45:37,590 --> 02:45:44,430
I miss him I miss him The air hike tax returns.

2469
02:45:44,470 --> 02:45:52,770
Yeah, that's why it said 20000 I was like, I noticed that the amount went up, so I was just... wait Or was it 20000 before?

2470
02:45:53,350 --> 02:45:55,230
No, it was 20000 before, wasn't it?

2471
02:45:56,190 --> 02:45:56,750
That's right.

2472
02:45:57,230 --> 02:45:58,630
It was 20000 before.

2473
02:45:58,890 --> 02:46:03,170
I do remember It was 20k?

2474
02:46:03,270 --> 02:46:08,770
Yeah Okay, nevermind Nevermind.

2475
02:46:09,630 --> 02:46:14,310
I stand corrected Minto, who is your favorite IMAZ 765 idol?

2476
02:46:14,810 --> 02:46:15,250
765?

2477
02:46:18,270 --> 02:46:22,530
I really like Takane, but I also really love Hibiki

2478
02:46:32,040 --> 02:46:40,720
If you buy the air hike, you can shoot the air hike This is the Riz chapter?

2479
02:46:42,320 --> 02:46:43,540
Is it long?

2480
02:46:44,780 --> 02:46:45,820
Is it long?

2481
02:46:45,880 --> 02:46:53,400
I really gotta pack You can reply... Oh, you can replay missions between streams to farm.

2482
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:53,840
True!

2483
02:46:58,440 --> 02:47:00,400
It can be really short.

2484
02:47:00,620 --> 02:47:03,200
It's long It's pretty long.

2485
02:47:03,320 --> 02:47:03,580
Okay.

2486
02:47:03,780 --> 02:47:06,480
Alright, we'll do it next time then Next time!

2487
02:47:08,460 --> 02:47:09,780
Thank you guys!

2488
02:47:10,680 --> 02:47:20,920
Hopefully this made... I know it wasn't super duper long either, but hopefully it made up for my poor performance last time And we got through a couple bosses.

2489
02:47:21,240 --> 02:47:22,780
We got through, what, Cerberus?

2490
02:47:24,320 --> 02:47:26,580
Does the worm count as a boss?

2491
02:47:27,480 --> 02:47:29,300
Is mayonnaise an instrument?

2492
02:47:30,360 --> 02:47:34,680
I guess it doesn't count as a boss unless you get a thing from it, huh?

2493
02:47:38,690 --> 02:47:42,310
Worm is a boss It does technically count.

2494
02:47:42,410 --> 02:47:47,270
Yeah, only three missions today, but that's okay Three missions in three hours

2495
02:47:52,090 --> 02:48:01,250
Nobody wanted the centipede powers, so they just were like, it's a boss, but we don't need you And we got to see Jester.

2496
02:48:01,350 --> 02:48:08,970
That was fun Probably miss your Friday stream since that's when I'm flying to Atlanta So I just want to wish you good luck at the concert.

2497
02:48:09,090 --> 02:48:11,010
I have my life sticks ready Let's go!

2498
02:48:11,290 --> 02:48:12,130
I'll see you then!

2499
02:48:12,650 --> 02:48:13,790
Oh my gosh.

2500
02:48:14,310 --> 02:48:14,750
Yippee!

2501
02:48:17,650 --> 02:48:19,770
Yippee, yippee Worm counts as a boss?

2502
02:48:19,850 --> 02:48:20,330
That sucks.

2503
02:48:20,450 --> 02:48:21,250
It sucks

2504
02:48:31,270 --> 02:48:34,730
I love the Touhou characters and music, but how does one get into Touhou?

2505
02:48:35,430 --> 02:48:39,590
I did buy a few games during the last Steam sale Stale?

2506
02:48:39,770 --> 02:48:40,110
Sale?

2507
02:48:42,430 --> 02:48:49,690
A lot of Touhou... I feel like Touhou is more fanon than canon So...

2508
02:48:50,810 --> 02:48:51,250
Really?

2509
02:48:53,230 --> 02:48:53,670
Just...

2510
02:48:53,670 --> 02:48:58,990
I don't know how I got into...

2511
02:48:58,990 --> 02:48:59,970
I'll be honest

2512
02:49:06,890 --> 02:49:10,990
I frequent a certain...

2513
02:49:11,890 --> 02:49:14,030
Wait, how do I say it?

2514
02:49:14,790 --> 02:49:16,990
Well, I frequent...

2515
02:49:17,850 --> 02:49:22,170
How I got into Touhou is so silly So I...

2516
02:49:23,490 --> 02:49:42,820
I would go on the image board site Danboru And I would see the characters on there And I was just like, they're so cute!

2517
02:49:43,580 --> 02:49:49,160
And so that's how... All I did was see the characters and be like Oh wow!

2518
02:49:49,620 --> 02:49:50,740
They're so cute!

2519
02:49:50,740 --> 02:49:54,320
I still use Danboru for like...

2520
02:49:54,320 --> 02:50:01,680
I use it for like inspo stuff For like outfits and everything And I use it for wallpapers

2521
02:50:06,140 --> 02:50:07,100
So yeah...

2522
02:50:08,280 --> 02:50:17,920
I don't know, I don't really know how you get into Touhou I think from there, then I was like... I found like the iosis You know

2523
02:50:21,440 --> 02:50:35,840
Like, you know, the music videos and listen to a lot of the music and stuff It really depends on what you want to get out of Touhou Guys, I think this is my third time asking, how many missions are in this game?

2524
02:50:36,060 --> 02:50:42,260
I forgot, I forgot to look at chat I ask a question sometimes and then I forget to look at chat, I'm really sorry 20!

2525
02:50:42,260 --> 02:50:57,100

2533
02:52:49,220 --> 02:52:51,500
No, nothing could be better than that

2534
02:52:54,540 --> 02:52:57,100
Nothing, nothing could beat my...

2535
02:52:57,100 --> 02:53:01,020
Everybody knows the best game in a series is with the silent protag

2536
02:53:04,820 --> 02:53:05,200
