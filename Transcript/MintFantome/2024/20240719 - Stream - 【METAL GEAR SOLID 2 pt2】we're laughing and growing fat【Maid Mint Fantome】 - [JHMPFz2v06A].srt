1
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,170
Where's the music?

2
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,060
There's the music.

3
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,560
Welcome back!

4
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,280
Hello everybody!

5
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,380
Welcome to...

6
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,200
Welcome back.

7
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,320
To Metal Gear Solid 2!

8
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,500
Hello,

9
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:19,370
hello.

10
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,670
One second, my controller is...

11
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,390
under some cables.

12
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,570
Okay.

13
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,530
I have like a very strange setup here because I have my GameCube...

14
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,030
and then also my PS2.

15
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,710
So it's like...

16
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,010
All these things that I kind of haphazardly set up.

17
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,750
I was like...

18
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,410
I'm lazy.

19
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,510
I don't feel like making it.

20
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,870
All the wires are kind of everywhere.

21
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,530
Don't worry about it!

22
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,110
Say it, boss.

23
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,290
For old times sake.

24
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,990
Kept you waiting, huh?

25
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,390
Yay!

26
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,110
How's my chair?

27
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,830
Actually...

28
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,550
It was an easier fix than I thought.

29
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,630
But I still don't know how it came undone.

30
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,750
Very strange.

31
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,710
For those who don't know, I did a hand cam stream yesterday.

32
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,870
And my chair broke on stream.

33
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,930
And I don't know how it did that.

34
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,210
There's no bolt missing or anything.

35
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,290
No nuts around.

36
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,630
I don't know.

37
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,550
It's very weird.

38
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,510
She said the thing!

39
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,610
Welcome to the membership!

40
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,790
Thanks for the five gifted!

41
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,990
You guys, I will be getting new emotes.

42
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,010
I gave a little bit of a preview.

43
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,950
In...

44
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,590
The members tab.

45
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,930
Community tab.

46
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,430
And some in pre-chat too.

47
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,490
Yeah!

48
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,070
Yippee!

49
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,010
It's actually two different artists.

50
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,630
So I'm going to...

51
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,530
Because I separated them.

52
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,950
One of them is already done.

53
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,070
But I'm going to wait for the other artist as well.

54
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,710
So that I can release them all together.

55
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,190
So...

56
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,770
I got into MGS because of you.

58
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,070
What you do to me.

59
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,190
I'm just spreading the good word.

60
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,310
I'm spreading the good word.

61
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,850
Of Metal Gear.

62
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,370
Yeah!

63
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,190
Chair sabotage by Lalilulelo.

64
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,170
So true.

65
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:28,230
So true!

66
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,210
Finally I'm green!

67
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,630
Thank you!

68
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,330
Hello Mint!

69
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,090
Hello, hello, hello!

70
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,330
Do you have a favorite voice line in MGS2?

71
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,330
Hmm...

72
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,630
That...

73
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,130
Is tough.

74
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,510
I think honestly...

75
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,570
It's any of Raiden's internal monologues.

76
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,510
I think yeah.

77
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,590
What a weirdo.

78
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,590
I love that one.

79
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,350
I love...

80
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,650
What an egotistical woman.

81
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,430
I love that one.

82
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,270
You're a real egotistical woman.

83
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

84
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,970
Thanks for the five gifted!

85
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,330
I love...

86
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,830
Infinite ammo.

87
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,090
Oh my gosh, what he points to it.

88
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,450
Let me also...

89
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,650
I will post my breathing.

90
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,130
If Mint's chair is broken, we shall become her chair.

91
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,250
Dibs on the footrest.

92
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:31,650
Stop!

93
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,830
TV table tray!

94
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,730
Thanks for the ten gifted!

95
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,730
Thank you so much!

96
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,470
Not even a poster.

97
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,110
Oh my gosh, yes.

98
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,850
I love when...

99
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,670
There's too many iconic things.

100
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,070
But I think what I quote the most is literally...

101
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,810
Raiden's internal monologues.

102
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,390
Which maybe are not the more iconic things from the game.

103
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,670
You know, you have stuff like dud.

104
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,230
And...

105
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,330
And we've managed to avoid drowning, you know.

106
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,490
Get real.

107
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,590
It's just too much.

108
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,270
It's but...

109
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,170
I quote those all the time.

110
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,790
You got me into MGS and it's so much fun.

111
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,590
Thanks Vise.

112
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,170
Of course!

113
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,990
Thank you Shy Guy.

114
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,170
Let's see.

115
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:16,510
Okay.

116
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,030
Please no spoilers in the chat.

117
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:24,870
Not for me, but for anyone who may be joining us and...

118
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,950
watching MGS for the first time.

119
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,050
Thank you!

120
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,390
Replace spend message.

121
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,190
Sorry again about the time change.

122
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,670
If you're watching the VOD...

123
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,850
Hello!

124
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,390
Thanks for watching the VOD!

125
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,770
But if you're here, thank you so much.

126
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,390
I'm so sorry that I had to change it.

127
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,570
I did a little whoopsie in my brain with my schedule.

128
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,110
And kind of had to adjust a little bit.

129
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:52,990
Do it yourself!

130
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,010
Is my fave.

131
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,270
Get a Herman Miller then name it Master Miller.

132
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,570
But aren't Herman Miller's like super duper expensive, right?

133
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,970
Do we still hide the spoilers with smiley faces?

134
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:04,350
Yes!

135
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,490
If you wouldn't mind, you know.

136
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,170
I'll do my best as well.

137
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,050
Again, I know we get a little bit excited.

138
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,210
But um... yeah.

139
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,970
Early in the day is...

140
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,690
earlier time is more convenient for me.

141
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,190
Yippee!

142
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,410
Yeah, I know sometimes it'll be more convenient for some people.

143
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,550
And it was like kinda last month.

144
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,410
That I had to change the time.

145
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,310
So I'm so sorry!

146
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,630
No, that is not Solid Snake.

147
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,290
Oh my gosh, yes!

148
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,110
That's so good too.

149
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,250
But um...

150
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,830
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

151
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,910
Use ones for cheap when office is remodeled.

152
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:41,250
Oh!

153
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,870
Are they that nice though?

154
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,890
Like are they that comfy?

155
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,630
I actually really like my chair.

156
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,070
I've had it for several years now.

157
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:47,830
Hugo!

158
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,130
Welcome to membership!

159
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,010
Thank you!

160
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,930
MGS on my birthday!

161
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,450
Can I get a happy birthday minto?

162
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:53,950
Of course!

163
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,210
Happy birthday to you!

164
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,890
Happy birthday to you!

165
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,610
Happy birthday Jay Frosty!

166
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,030
Happy birthday to you!

167
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,050
Happy birthday!

168
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,210
If anyone can justify an expensive chair, a successful full-time streamer with Backpenta.

169
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,940
Why are you calling me out?

170
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,640
Oh my gosh.

171
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,480
I don't have my good contacts in.

172
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,080
So it's hard to see sometimes.

173
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,640
Miss Dayz?

174
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,560
Miss Tyze!

175
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,540
Miss Tyze!

176
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,000
Thanks for three months.

177
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,360
Master Miller chair one.

178
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,260
It's writing a message about... Oh my gosh, I read that as MGS.

179
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,100
A message about the time someone mentioned Herman Miller.

180
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,380
Get it?

181
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,320
It is life-changing.

182
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,700
I got one for $400 from Second Hand Distro.

183
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,520
Because offices, I'm using this to put the shillet.

184
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:01,700
Oh.

185
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,380
Treat yourself, dummy!

186
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,740
You guys, I almost...

187
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,020
I tried to treat myself today.

188
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:13,820
There was a bubble tea place that opened near my maid cafe and I was like, I'm gonna go get bubble tea!

189
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,540
I was gonna treat myself.

190
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,300
And it wasn't open yet.

191
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,280
It wasn't open yet.

192
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,560
I didn't get it.

193
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,480
It said I got cake.

194
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,060
It said I went to the store and I was like, fine.

195
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,120
I'll just go get cake.

196
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,700
And I ate one bite of it.

197
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,280
And then I put it in my fridge.

198
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,100
Because that's what I do.

199
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,880
I'm gonna eat one bite of it and then put it back in my fridge.

200
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:42,980
Brick!

201
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,380
A Minto gear solid stream on my birthday!

202
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,020
It's the perfect present.

203
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,100
How did you know?

204
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,220
Oh my gosh!

205
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,680
Happy birthday to you!

206
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,320
Happy birthday to you!

207
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,260
Happy birthday dear Brick!

208
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,640
Happy birthday to you!

209
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,780
Happy birthday!

210
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,980
Okay, Saku.

211
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,800
I'll be on the lookout for you sending me the place that you got your chair.

212
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,940
I'll look into them.

213
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,380
I'll look into them.

214
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,120
My chair is perfectly fine though.

215
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,880
It's hard to justify dropping that much money.

216
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,180
Well, I say perfectly fine.

217
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,160
It broke last night.

218
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,680
But I think it's okay now.

219
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,680
You know?

220
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,700
But then there's also me who's just like, gosh.

221
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,680
I'll waste money.

222
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,800
I spend my money on things that I don't need sometimes.

223
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,960
Like Metal Gear merch.

224
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:56,580
But also, I'll be like, what if I just upgrade my computer and get a new graphics card?

225
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,000
Because I want my PC to be all white and aesthetic.

226
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,160
When my graphics card is perfectly fine.

227
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,280
But also, I use my graphics card every day.

228
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,580
So like, what if I also, what if I just, you know...

229
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,240
Spray paint it?

230
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,420
Oh my gosh.

231
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:17,760
Sorry.

232
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,500
My contacts are so bad today.

233
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:20,880
Well...

234
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,000
Sounds like a business expense to me.

235
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,620
You're so right though.

236
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,680
And then I was also looking at the height.

237
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,200
They have like the PC cases that have...

238
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,360
that have like the little screen on them.

239
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,780
And I was like, I could put something on that.

240
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,920
What could I put on that?

241
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,600
Oh my gosh.

242
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,040
Nexy!

243
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,200
Thank you.

244
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,400
Thank you, Master Miller.

245
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,600
Thank you.

246
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,900
I summoned a loose screw for Minto to buy chairs.

247
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,360
Yeah.

248
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,180
Going to get a doki case.

249
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,020
It's too yellow.

250
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,200
Right now...

251
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,160
Right now... Wait, I just realized some of my lights aren't on.

252
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Right now my setup is pink and blue.

253
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,900
But also, I have the Corsair fans.

254
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,800
But they're off-colored.

255
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:20,880
I don't think they're... If I set it to red or pink, it's turns more like orange.

256
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,700
Makes me so sad.

257
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,360
Get doki to play Metal Gear to see her reaction.

258
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,660
I don't know if she would like Metal Gear.

259
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,780
Mint case.

260
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,060
Hmm...

261
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,640
Have I played Metal Gear Rising Revengeance on stream?

262
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,540
Not yet!

263
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,400
I'll play it eventually.

264
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,000
Once we get through the series.

265
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,700
Too much cutscene for her small bird brain.

266
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,680
You think?

267
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,400
MGS is too much thinking.

268
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,060
You guys are roasting her!

269
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,160
You guys are roasting her!

270
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:10,500
Wow!

271
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,560
No, but I do think maybe...

272
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:15,920
I don't know.

273
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,440
She played, what, Sandland?

274
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,600
But she doesn't typically do, like, games that...

275
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,120
are so long.

276
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,720
You know what I mean?

277
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,240
She might like Five.

278
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,580
I think she would like to play Five, probably, right?

279
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:29,780
Hmm...

280
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,640
It's a thinker man's game.

281
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,800
Which MGS is your least favorite?

282
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,010
Five.

283
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,310
But only...

284
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,330
Only cause of...

285
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,170
the story.

286
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,650
The gameplay is top tier.

287
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,770
Even a pigeon would have a better time...

288
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,670
Five for the writing, yeah.

289
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,510
But Five for the gameplay is my favorite.

290
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,670
The gameplay is 10 out of 10.

291
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,410
So great.

292
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,190
Not because of Kiefer.

293
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,230
He's fine.

294
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,970
I played Five first.

295
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,990
I think it'd be a good intro.

296
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,410
Oh...

297
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,470
Wait...

298
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,070
Are you...

299
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,990
Are you being sarcastic?

300
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:33,330
How can you play Five before you play Peace Walker?

301
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,610
I don't understand.

302
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:37,910
But...

303
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,130
Going back to the Kiefer Sutherland thing...

304
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,030
I actually don't mind him voicing...

305
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:44,690
Venom.

306
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,550
Because...

307
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,350
I think if I heard...

308
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,850
If I heard David Hayter be so brooding and sad, I might be like...

309
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,970
I can't... I can't deal with this.

310
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,750
Love how you scared Doki with Freddy the Scream.

311
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,250
Truly a cinema moment.

312
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,370
I feel like Metal Gear...

313
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,810
I'm guessing you like bipedal war machines in a good way.

314
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,310
Might I recommend Titanfall 2?

315
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,010
I do like...

316
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,370
I do...

317
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,010
I do... I do...

318
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,150
I do like Machine.

319
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,210
Yes.

320
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,490
That reminds me...

321
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,430
I was...

322
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,010
was going through some of my stuff from Ofgai.

323
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:33,570
I got a big old package and it's kind of just been sitting in, like, the box that got sent to me.

324
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,650
And there were some things in there that...

325
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,430
I didn't even see before they were sent out.

326
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,050
Like someone...

327
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,930
I'm going to say your Twitter name because that's what you wrote on it.

328
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:50,290
Angel Milk42, thank you for the iCots book, if you're watching.

329
00:17:52,250 --> 00:18:04,590
And someone gifted me the Phantom Pain hand, and then a steelbook case of the Phantom Pain.

330
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,290
So thank you!

331
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,510
10,000% seriousness?

332
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:12,930
Noooo!

333
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,010
Lorem, weirdness hooked my brain.

334
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,390
I knew the vague snake story because friends are obsessed.

335
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:20,910
Okay.

336
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,770
I shut up.

337
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,310
We'll ride in.

338
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,910
Noooo!

339
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,990
You don't even know who Ocelot is!

340
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,350
You don't even know who Miller is!

341
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,230
You don't even know who Chico is!

342
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,410
You don't even know who Paz is!

343
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,430
You don't even know who Snake is!

344
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,690
There's no reason to play 5 before you play anything else!

345
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,550
You don't know what's going on!

346
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,110
How could you know what's going on?

347
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:44,910
How could you know?

348
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,530
How could you know?

349
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,410
How could you know what's happening?

350
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,430
You would just go in, you'd be like so confused.

351
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,190
If you didn't even play Ground Zeroes...

352
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,590
Okay, at least play Ground Zeroes.

353
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,830
But then you're still just like...

354
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,990
I don't even know what Mother Base is.

355
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,170
I don't know what MSF is.

356
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,150
I don't know who Chico is.

357
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:57,890
I don't know who Paz is.

358
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:58,670
I don't know why...

359
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,190
Why should I care about Paz blowing up?

360
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,770
Don't play 5 first!

361
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,090
First!

362
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:14,290
God!

363
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,270
There's my aneurysm.

364
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,890
Oh my gosh, I'm starting to see black.

365
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:22,490
Hold on.

366
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,330
What did you say, Dogstrings?

367
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,670
I'm going to Ani-Revo this year?

368
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,430
I was hyped to hear you were joining Doki for a bit.

369
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:30,950
Yeah!

370
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,870
Doing our concert together.

371
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,220
We gotta start with Peace Walker.

372
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,040
Peace Walker, GZ, Peace Wa...

373
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,560
Oh, wait.

374
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,540
Peace Walker, GZ, and Peace...

375
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,180
Wait, and Peace Wa...

376
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:47,820
You mean Pantopage?

377
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,220
No.

378
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,980
Make up MGS5.

379
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,500
Yes.

380
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,540
But then you can't play Peace Walker without playing 3.

381
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,580
You see the problem here?

382
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,360
You see the problem here?

383
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,460
Then you have to...

384
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,360
You can't play 3 without playing 1 or 2.

385
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:05,880
You don't have to.

386
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,800
You don't know who Ocelot is.

387
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,680
You don't know anything about the Patriots.

388
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,740
You don't know anything.

389
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,800
You don't know...

390
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,620
Well, I guess you learned about the Philosopher's Legacy.

391
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,100
Wait, did they mention the Philosopher's Legacy in this game?

392
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,600
I'm trying not to talk about spoilers.

393
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,200
But you don't know anything!

394
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,100
You don't know anything!

395
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,080
You have to start at the beginning!

396
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,140
Oh no, she's nerding out.

397
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,280
Calm down, Min...

398
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:31,760
I'm sorry.

399
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,420
I'm sorry.

400
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,120
I'm sorry.

401
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,620
I'm sorry.

402
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:34,760
I'm sorry.

403
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,140
I'm sorry.

404
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,520
They don't mention in this game.

405
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,260
Okay.

406
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,080
But...

407
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,020
There's the spoilers at the end of the game.

408
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,000
The little call with...

409
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:46,940
With...

410
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,060
With...

411
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:48,900
About...

412
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,600
About...

413
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,140
About the...

414
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,120
Wait for Delta.

415
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,520
The best way to get into Metal Gear.

416
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:00,260
Truly though, I think Delta will get so many people playing Metal Gear for the first time.

417
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,380
I'm quite excited about it.

418
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,560
But I'm also just like...

419
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,740
Ocelot.

420
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,840
You just...

421
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,300
You just won't understand!

422
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,900
Gotta start at Snatchers or Psychonauts.

423
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,040
Okay.

424
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,720
I am done talking about Metal Gear for so long.

425
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,380
You gotta start at MGS by watching a playthrough.

426
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,480
Oh, sure!

427
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,280
Thank you for the birthday gift!

428
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,440
Thank you so much!

429
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,860
Which MGS game did you play first hand?

430
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,600
Oh, Metal Gear...

431
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,140
Oh, sorry.

432
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,840
Which MGS?

433
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:38,900
Of course!

434
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,980
I started at Metal Gear Solid 1!

435
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,920
What are you talking about?

436
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,420
Now, if you would ask me which Metal Gear I started at, that's a different story.

437
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,860
But you specifically said, which MGS did you start at?

438
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,720
And MGS Metal Gear Solid is its own thing.

439
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,380
And then Metal Gear Rising.

440
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,380
That's MGR.

441
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,480
You know some...

442
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:58,960
It's...

443
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,840
It's like...

444
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,700
It's...

445
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,040
It's...

446
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,720
You know...

447
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,000
It's the specifics.

448
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,080
The specifics matter.

449
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,760
Right?

450
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,020
Yeah.

451
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,280
Semantics.

452
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:16,820
Yep.

453
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,480
Yep.

454
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:17,980
They're important.

455
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,540
What if I play Phantom Pain and nothing else?

456
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,220
What a nerd!

457
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,540
But yeah.

458
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,340
Let's see.

459
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,900
Last time we left off, we were about to defuse some bombs.

460
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,060
We got our smelly detector.

461
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,540
Hold on.

462
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,240
I'm holding it.

463
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,660
I'm putting it over chat.

464
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,060
P.U.

465
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,040
We're, uhm...

466
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,360
Gonna defuse the bombs and, yeah.

467
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,620
We met Plissken.

468
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,020
I took out my earbuds to avoid rage spoilers.

469
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,560
No!

470
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,980
I don't think I spoil......

471
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,340
Oh.

472
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,740
I don't think I spoiled anything.

473
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,920
I just said that you need to know this, to know that, to know this, to know that.

474
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,980
Today is my birthday!

475
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,620
Can you sing me happy birthday?

476
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,500
Also, can't wait to see you.

477
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,320
Otaku-tan!

478
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:20,880
Thank you!

479
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,820
Happy birthday to you!

480
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,180
Happy birthday to you!

481
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,080
Happy birthday!

482
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,900
Nuts on fire!

483
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,000
Happy birthday to you!

484
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,700
I spoiled a little bit?

485
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,440
Oh, I mentioned pause.

486
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,100
Oh.

487
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,440
Yeah, okay.

488
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,460
That was my bad.

489
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,640
That was a ground zero spoiler.

490
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,100
My bad.

491
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,840
My bad, my bad, my bad, my bad.

492
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,580
But um...

493
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,680
You mentioned so much...

494
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,460
No, I didn't!

495
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,500
We are not so...

496
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,140
Ah, this is my cat!

497
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,100
She's so cute!

498
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,600
Oh my gosh, you guys.

499
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:22,540
Last night, I was doing my face mask and I walk into my bedroom and both of my cats are laying where I'm supposed to lay.

500
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,540
They're like right underneath my pillow.

501
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,440
And it's the first time!

502
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,320
Usually, Paz sleeps at my feet.

503
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,420
But this was the first time!

504
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,420
This was the first time!

505
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,240
She laid close to my head!

506
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,300
I was so happy.

507
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,460
I was so happy.

508
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:47,880
And then this morning, I went to feed her and she was laying down and she stood up and she stretched and she let out the nastiest fart.

509
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,480
You guys, I think I have to rename her to Johnny.

510
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,320
Real.

511
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,940
I think I have to rename her to Johnny.

512
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,620
I really need to take her to the vet for her.

513
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,800
I think she has I think she has IBS or something.

514
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,540
I think she has a like a real problem.

515
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,400
Sometimes she gets like drippy and just like drips poop everywhere.

516
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,180
I'm constantly having to clean.

517
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,960
She hasn't in a while though.

518
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,100
But I really need to take her to the vet.

519
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,480
But I was so focused on Butaro.

520
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,540
I hadn't been able to take her.

521
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,600
I was like focusing on him first.

522
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,360
I'm just constantly going to the vet over and over and over again.

523
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,400
Nah.

524
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,800
Not the stinky duo.

525
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,260
She's like legitimately stinky.

526
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,640
Ripped the people eating while walking the street.

527
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,440
I'm so sorry.

528
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,800
But yeah, Butaro is eating better.

529
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,280
He is.

530
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,720
But he's like, I think he has like food and anxiety now.

531
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,940
Because he was hungry for so long because he wasn't able to eat.

532
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,960
But now he's like constantly, constantly constantly begging for food.

533
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,100
So I'm constantly, constantly, constantly having to feed him.

534
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,980
But he eats it up!

535
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,040
He eats it up!

536
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,400
So uh...

537
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,500
But he's been eating a lot.

538
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,940
And gaining weight.

539
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,480
So I'm happy about that.

540
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,920
And he hasn't been throwing up.

541
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,000
But it's been pretty good.

542
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,460
All things considered.

543
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:33,760
Yeah.

544
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,080
Okay, it's been a half hour.

545
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,180
I'm loading the game.

546
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,660
Let me know how the audio is and everything too.

547
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,360
This one.

548
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,160
I wonder where it's going to put us.

549
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:05,860
Stinky.

550
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,260
Where am I?

551
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,490
What?

552
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,370
What?

553
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,910
Where am I?

554
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:28,790
Okay, hold on.

555
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,190
I have to remember how to play the game.

556
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,460
Okay.

557
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,800
Raiden's behind looks very good here!

558
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,840
Wowee!

559
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,200
Oh my goodness!

560
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,220
Look at that!

561
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,540
My lumps!

562
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,000
My lovely lady lumps!

563
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,160
Wow!

564
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,240
Uh...

565
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,000
There we go.

566
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,140
Wowee!

567
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,720
Okay.

568
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,760
Oh, this is where Snake went.

569
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,700
Okay.

570
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,460
Oh my gosh.

571
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,280
That scared the badonkas out of me.

572
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,700
Blizz can win that way!

573
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,420
Oh my gosh!

574
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,480
Who am I talking about?

575
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,020
So a guy comes down this way?

576
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,470
What am I hearing?

577
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,530
I'm hearing a buzzing sound.

578
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,800
No!

579
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,760
It's not Solid Snake!

580
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,240
Sorry!

581
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,840
I totally... You know how...

582
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,760
Okay, so sorry.

583
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,560
I was reading some fan theories online that said that...

584
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,020
That maybe...

585
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,240
Blizzkin is Solid Snake, but I think it's totally BS.

586
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,600
Yeah, Snake died.

587
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,480
It's really sad.

588
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:38,950
Shoot!

589
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:41,210
Wait.

590
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:42,650
Okay, okay.

591
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,390
Just got here from my favorite soap opera.

592
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,650
Starting riding in rows.

593
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,770
Why am I forgetting everything on how to play this game again?

594
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,490
Oh my goodness.

595
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,010
Okay.

596
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,630
Where did that guy go anyway?

597
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,110
Do you think he'll see me right here?

598
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,310
I know, I know.

599
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,310
I gotta find the nerd.

600
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,290
I think there's this guy and then there's also...

601
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,230
Do you guys hear that buzzing?

602
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,490
Or is it just me?

603
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,890
Do you guys hear a buzzing or is it just...

604
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,530
Oh, it's driving me insane.

605
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,840
Oh, it's the bugs at the doorway!

606
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,720
Oh my gosh.

607
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,500
They're driving me actually insane.

608
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,430
Come on, guy.

609
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,150
Come back, please.

610
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,310
Oh, here he comes.

611
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:32,630
Here he comes.

612
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,540
I'm too scared.

613
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,820
I'm too...

614
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,340
Oh my god.

615
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,080
Wait, wait, wait.

616
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,460
Wait.

617
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,620
Where is he?

618
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,720
I'm too scared to move.

619
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,980
I gotta get back into it.

620
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,100
I gotta get back into it.

621
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,120
Knock on the wall.

622
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,000
I'm scared.

623
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,380
Sorry.

624
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,180
I'm gonna take a second to get used to it.

625
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,540
I don't know why I'm feeling so strange about the game all of a sudden.

626
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,680
I feel like I'm a baby.

627
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,400
Like I've just been thrown into something and I don't even know what I'm doing.

628
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,120
I don't know why I'm feeling so uncomfortable.

629
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,640
Uncomfortable, I think is the right word.

630
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,880
I'm feeling uncomfortable.

631
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,680
I don't know why.

632
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,540
Hello?

633
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,700
Please come back.

634
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,720
You're taking...

635
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,940
I'm sick of these bugs.

636
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,940
I just wanna get used to the game, but you're making me uncomfortable.

637
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,660
You're becoming too much like Raiden.

638
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,050
Where is he?

639
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:47,650
Wait.

640
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,630
I think he's coming.

641
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,130
I hear him.

642
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:08,450
Hello?

643
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,990
My hands are cramping.

644
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,240
Okay.

645
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,280
Goodnight.

646
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,560
Okay.

647
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,820
I think there's a guy...

648
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,780
Isn't there a guy in here?

649
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,480
Where's the nerd at?

650
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,680
No, I'm still...

651
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,080
I'm still hearing the... I don't hear the buzzing anymore.

652
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,440
Huh.

653
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:00,800
Huh.

654
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,720
I don't hear it when I pause.

655
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,540
Weird.

656
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,440
Bottom right?

657
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,700
Down here?

658
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:09,840
No.

659
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,840
Where's the nerd?

660
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,820
Oh, shut up!

661
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,420
I hate you guys!

662
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,900
Is he the guy that was wandering this room?

663
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:19,580
Oh!

664
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,160
No, no, no.

665
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,540
Oh my god.

666
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,800
I saw it though.

667
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,060
Huh.

668
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,480
There we go.

669
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,080
Alright, come on.

670
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,860
Uh, there we go.

671
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,580
Ahhh!

672
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,600
Sorry.

673
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,460
Oh my gosh.

674
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,960
I don't know why I'm feeling so weird!

675
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:02,980
Anxious.

676
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,540
Anxious, anxious.

677
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,240
So we have this.

678
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,380
This is finding our stinky... stinkiness.

679
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,400
Do you have anything for me?

680
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,520
Any lockers in here?

681
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,080
Hmm.

682
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,560
Take that though.

683
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,040
Could I stick him...

684
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,800
in here?

685
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,740
I was like, who else do I hear asleep?

686
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:34,660
Let me in!

687
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,440
Okay!

688
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,800
The toilet!

689
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,160
Can we put him in there?

690
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,960
Eh, it's fine.

691
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,400
We'll just leave.

692
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,890
I hear a buzzing.

693
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:54,010
Okay.

694
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,450
First bomb!

695
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,410
Um...

696
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,830
It is up here.

697
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,470
Yay!

698
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,840
Her big voice!

699
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,320
Anything wrong?

700
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,120
Maybe.

701
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,380
Plissken's reported other locations too.

702
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,660
And none of them are effective demolition points.

703
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,460
What do you mean?

704
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,940
It means that they wouldn't be the best places to choose if you wanted to destroy this place.

705
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,440
Are you saying they don't plan on blowing the shell up?

706
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:32,980
Wiggle, wiggle.

707
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,840
It certainly seems that way.

708
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,920
So far we haven't seen anything but a waste of good explosives.

709
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,140
Unless, of course, we're missing something.

710
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,040
A trap?

711
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,360
Whatever.

712
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,700
There's something going on.

713
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,720
Right.

714
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,160
Whatever.

715
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,920
Alright, let's head back to this place.

716
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,380
Whatever!

717
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,720
Is there a way for us to send you fan letter?

718
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,900
If we do, is there a certain letter writing protocol we should follow?

719
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:03,860
Um...

720
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:11,420
I don't really have a place to send fan letters, unfortunately.

721
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,560
Um...

722
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,980
I appreciate you...

723
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,460
And it's gone.

724
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,980
I appreciate you wanting to.

725
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,580
Um...

726
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,740
And if you ever...

727
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,780
If I ever do have a way for you to send fan letters, you can...

728
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,160
It's not like, you know...

729
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,500
We can just ramble on about random stuff we're doing.

730
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,760
Yeah, you can always just...

731
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,440
It doesn't have to be like a set whatever.

732
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,860
It can just be something.

733
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,300
Hello?

734
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,580
Oh, there it is.

735
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:48,720
Shoot.

736
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,150
There we go.

737
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,180
La la la la la.

738
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,830
Fortune was there.

739
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,530
That's where the dud happened.

740
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:07,670
The dud.

741
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,950
Can you receive psychic messages?

742
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,890
Or Ouija board summonings?

743
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,130
I try to ignore the Ouija board stuff.

744
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,370
Cause um...

745
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,820
Where is it here?

746
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I don't remember actually.

747
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,260
I hear it like right here.

748
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,920
I don't remember.

749
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,360
I don't remember where it's at.

750
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,980
Where does that guy go?

751
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,410
Does he come through here?

752
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,260
He's not gonna hear me.

753
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,970
I don't think it's in here, is it?

754
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:13,990
No, it can't be in the locker.

755
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,950
Oh, let's put this guy in the locker though.

756
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,410
Come here.

757
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:20,990
Come here, Bobby.

758
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:22,470
Come here.

759
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,530
Come on, come on, come on.

760
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:25,970
Oh wait.

761
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,170
I might have to wait.

762
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,210
I might have to loop around again.

763
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,810
If you would stop snoring so loudly.

764
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:36,910
Maybe.

765
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,810
Good night, sweet prince.

766
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,630
There's another one for this guy too.

767
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,160
Where is he?

768
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,150
Where is the guy?

769
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,290
Oh shoot.

770
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,970
Oh, he's coming this way.

771
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:13,790
We'll get him.

772
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:16,250
We'll get him once he starts walking away.

773
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,160
There we go.

774
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,140
Good night, little babies.

775
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,620
Good night, little babies.

776
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,120
Good night, little babies.

777
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,800
Good night, little babies.

778
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,200
What do you got for me?

779
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,500
I'll take that.

780
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,020
Good night, little babies.

781
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,980
Good night, boys.

782
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:52,720
Thank you.

783
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,300
Thank you, thank you.

784
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:56,680
Wait.

785
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,860
I can't remember where this one is though.

786
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,300
And now they go into the locker.

787
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,580
And they don't wake up.

788
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,760
Good night.

789
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,820
Okay, perfect.

790
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,940
One for each guy.

791
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,400
Where was it again?

792
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,580
It stinks in here.

793
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,880
Not in here.

794
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,280
It stinks in here.

795
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,740
I hear it.

796
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,020
Or I heard it.

797
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,520
This area is so vague.

798
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,060
This area is so vague.

799
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,140
This one is so sneaky.

800
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,840
This one is so sneaky.

801
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,400
Because it's smelly everywhere but then you hear it here.

802
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,300
Because it's smelly everywhere but then you hear it here.

803
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,720
It's so confusing.

804
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,920
Why are you so sneaky?

805
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,480
I can't remember at all where it is.

806
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,880
Is it in the doorway?

807
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:01,780
Hello?

808
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,060
Hello?

809
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,880
Do I need to crawl?

810
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,220
Did they just leave all the blood and everything?

811
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,460
Why can I hear it?

812
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,340
Maybe it's on the other side.

813
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,220
But I don't hear...

814
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,180
Oh, I heard it.

815
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,220
Beep.

816
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:23,880
Beep.

817
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,360
Beep.

818
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:24,880
Beep.

819
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:29,690
What the...

820
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,490
Crawl on the ground like a baby?

821
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:37,750
Should I cry like a baby too?

822
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:46,590
Thank you so much for the 30 gifts.

823
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,200
Okay, I'm annoying myself.

824
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,580
I'm even annoying myself.

825
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,020
Guys!

826
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,140
I know you're gonna say no ALP.

827
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,580
Could I get a hint?

828
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,320
I don't remember at all where it is.

829
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,840
I don't remember at all.

830
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,530
Those doors closed.

831
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,640
Oh my god!

832
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,300
Thanks for the ALP.

833
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,340
Laugh.

834
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,140
Laugh.

835
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,360
Yeah.

836
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,000
Yippee!

837
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,700
Alright.

838
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,420
Onward we go.

839
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,800
Uh...

840
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,900
Where else do we need to go?

841
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,260
Hold on, I'm gonna call.

842
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,920
Please can't!

843
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,600
Me too!

844
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,980
This one was in a spot so narrow I had to crawl in to get at it.

845
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,240
Oh, we're gonna have to do that too later on.

846
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,320
Stillman!

847
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,060
Where do I go?

848
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:25,560
Leah!

849
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:26,880
Riding reporting.

850
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,180
The C4 in Strut B has been disposed of.

851
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:30,580
Hello!

852
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,300
The wall containing the transformer panel was set to blow.

853
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,540
You're taking too much time.

854
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,060
You should work a little faster.

855
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:38,440
Sorry.

856
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,580
There's no time riding.

857
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,720
I've got my hands full here so it doesn't look like I can help you.

858
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,820
Okay, nobody asked you.

859
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,360
It's in your hands.

860
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:45,900
Well done.

861
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,680
It looks like there are no more bombs in that strut.

862
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,120
Wait, what?

863
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,820
Now, head for the other struts.

864
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,480
Huh?

865
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,330
Riding with his gaming posture.

866
00:43:58,750 --> 00:43:59,230
Run.

867
00:43:59,330 --> 00:43:59,870
I love it.

868
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,330
Lali... lu...

869
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:04,570
Wait.

870
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:06,530
Lalialulelo.

871
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:12,670
Head to the other struts.

872
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:13,830
Oh.

873
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:14,210
No!

874
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:15,670
I just missed.

875
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:15,890
Oh.

876
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:16,710
Hello.

877
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:18,710
Go.

878
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,050
Good night.

879
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:21,790
Good night.

880
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:22,710
Good night.

881
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:23,390
Good night.

882
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:24,410
Good night.

883
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:24,510
Good night.

884
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:24,990
Good night.

885
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:25,210
Good night.

886
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,190
Come back here so I can loot you.

887
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:27,890
Please.

888
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:28,490
Thank you.

889
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:29,250
Okay.

890
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:36,650
Lalialulelo.

891
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:42,930
M9 is such a good gun.

892
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:43,390
I know.

893
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:44,990
Oh my gosh.

894
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:45,570
I know.

895
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:49,390
It's just so nice.

896
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,250
It's just so nice having it.

897
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:53,830
Though I wish I had a suppressor on.

898
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:54,430
Hello?

899
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:55,590
Hello?

900
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,230
You little cheesy.

901
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,110
Give me something.

902
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:00,890
Give me a present.

903
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,560
There we go.

904
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,020
I think they meant the real M9.

905
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,940
This is the real M9.

906
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:18,840
What are you talking about?

907
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,220
Is it stinky in here or...

908
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,320
Is it you guys?

909
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,220
Oh my god.

910
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,100
There's somebody there.

911
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:30,460
No.

912
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,100
Get inside.

913
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,760
Get inside Raiden.

914
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,620
Raiden, close the door.

915
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,840
Raiden, close the door!

916
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:37,500
Oh god.

917
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:38,460
Okay.

918
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,040
Never mind.

919
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:41,840
Gosh, Raiden.

920
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,540
You scared me.

921
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,560
Oh, I see smelly.

922
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,140
I see smelly.

923
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,320
It's upstairs, I think?

924
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:53,680
Ah.

925
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,580
Oh, I think I have to go...

926
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,940
How do I get over to that area?

927
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:04,890
Jump.

928
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:05,850
Jump.

929
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:06,650
Jump.

930
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:08,590
What?

931
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:09,710
How did I...

932
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:10,410
There's somebody there.

933
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:11,030
No, there's not.

934
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:17,450
Just a...

935
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:18,550
Where's my box?

936
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:20,630
Where is my box?

937
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:22,670
Hello?

938
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:25,390
Wait.

939
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:30,770
I forgot.

940
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:31,330
I picked it up.

941
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:31,890
It's a...

942
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:34,490
A snake.

943
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:37,350
Yeah, I never got the box.

944
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:40,990
How did he see me?

945
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,470
This guy has eyes of a hawk.

946
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:45,110
For real.

947
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:51,810
Jump.

948
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:52,210
Jump.

949
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:53,670
Jump.

950
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,580
Oh my god.

951
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,700
He's the one that got me last time too.

952
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,860
So scared of him.

953
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,160
I'm so scared of this guy.

954
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,480
Okay.

955
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:15,620
Where do I go?

956
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:15,940
This way?

957
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,160
Okay, it's this room.

958
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,160
Okay, I know this room.

959
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,360
Oh my gosh.

960
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,720
Is there a locker in here?

961
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,500
Stuff you're in?

962
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,460
So I can take my time?

963
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:41,010
If I shoot that...

964
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:43,030
The guy in the other room will probably hear.

965
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:46,210
I think.

966
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:48,270
Is there a locker in here?

967
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:50,270
No, that's not a locker.

968
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:55,800
A box!

969
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,220
You guys say no Alp.

970
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,440
You guys say no Alp there.

971
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,440
Is the Alp right there?

972
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,180
I think I might have to take him out, you guys.

973
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:09,800
I think...

974
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,960
Oh, I have to tranquilize him as well.

975
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:12,440
You're right.

976
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:13,680
Okay, let's get that.

977
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:17,100
I think if I do it right here...

978
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,860
Will he see me?

979
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,600
Please don't see me.

980
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:21,540
Oh!

981
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,860
Dang it, he doesn't go far enough.

982
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:25,940
It's okay.

983
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,500
We'll just have to be speedy fast about it.

984
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,660
Now I have to remember...

985
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:36,180
how I did this before.

986
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,480
Alright, ride in.

987
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:40,640
Crawl.

988
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:41,600
Crawl.

989
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:41,840
Crawl.

990
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,160
Crawl.

991
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,180
Crawl this way.

992
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:43,740
Crawl.

993
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:44,340
Crawl.

994
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:44,780
Ride in.

995
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:45,620
Ride in.

996
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,000
I said we need to be speedy.

997
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,280
Come on.

998
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:47,760
Okay.

999
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:48,940
Crawl this way.

1000
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,100
He's waking up.

1001
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:52,920
No he's not!

1002
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:56,920
This way.

1003
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:04,430
Crawl.

1004
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:04,870
Crawl.

1005
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:05,390
Crawl.

1006
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:07,590
Will he be able to see me?

1007
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:09,790
Nice.

1008
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,050
Which way do I go?

1009
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:14,850
Oh shoot, I don't remember.

1010
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:16,750
I don't...

1011
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:17,430
What?

1012
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:18,730
What do you want?

1013
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,270
No one's going to leave a bomb...

1014
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:22,410
in a place that easy to reach.

1015
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:25,370
It would be more worthwhile to search convoluted areas...

1016
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:27,170
that can't be reached simply by walking.

1017
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,170
I'm working on it!

1018
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:31,750
Stillman, please!

1019
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:33,330
Let me do my job!

1020
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:35,150
God.

1021
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,210
I'm working on my art!

1022
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:41,610
How do I get through again?

1023
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:43,110
It's like over there.

1024
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,990
I don't remember where it is.

1025
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:48,550
I just...

1026
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:53,070
I just want to say that you were the cutest.

1027
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:54,770
Stop it!

1028
00:49:58,050 --> 00:49:58,870
I'm too slow.

1029
00:49:59,130 --> 00:49:59,430
I know!

1030
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:05,410
He's got...

1031
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:06,070
twosies.

1032
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:09,850
Sleep.

1033
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:13,750
I really want to take out this other guy so I can freely roll.

1034
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:16,150
Actually, I don't really just want to shoot him.

1035
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:19,130
Actually, I don't really just want to shoot him.

1036
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:19,810
I want to take him out in general.

1037
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:25,450
But I'm too good of a person.

1038
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,330
It's right there, isn't it?

1039
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:31,210
It's like right there.

1040
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:33,310
I think.

1041
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,270
Yeah, I see it!

1042
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:36,390
I literally see it!

1043
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,740
Can I go through here?

1044
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,120
No.

1045
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,820
Wait, I think I can go through right here.

1046
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,540
There it is!

1047
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:54,240
Oh my gosh.

1048
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:55,720
Okay.

1049
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:58,000
Can I go on top of this?

1050
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:58,260
Yeah.

1051
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:58,720
Okay.

1052
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,120
And we get our box!

1053
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:01,380
Yippee!

1054
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,180
Wait, can I go through here?

1055
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:03,900
Nope.

1056
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,500
Okay, hold on.

1057
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,480
I'm figuring it out.

1058
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,400
I'm figuring it out!

1059
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:11,840
How do I...

1060
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,920
How do I get over there?

1061
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:14,780
Um...

1062
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,320
Eh...

1063
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,280
It's right...

1064
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,280
Come on, Raiden.

1065
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,400
Just use your hands.

1066
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,760
Raiden, just...

1067
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,740
Raiden, just use your hands.

1068
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,300
Raiden, please.

1069
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,300
Oh my gosh.

1070
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,560
It's right there!

1071
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,840
How do I get through?

1072
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,300
Raiden.

1073
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:35,880
Raiden!

1074
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,580
Call Plissken?

1075
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:44,880
What's he got to say?

1076
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,120
Does he know this place?

1077
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:47,720
I mean...

1078
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,320
Raiden, don't get yourself worked up.

1079
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:51,920
I'm worked up!

1080
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,800
It's safer to take out the enemy first, then look for the bomb.

1081
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,440
Don't even think about searching for the bomb while looking over your shoulder for the enemy.

1082
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,560
Knock them unconscious or take them out altogether first.

1083
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,480
He's giving me permission!

1084
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,080
He's giving me permission to take them out.

1085
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,300
He's giving me permission to take them out.

1086
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:08,920
I mean...

1087
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:10,660
It's Plissken's advice.

1088
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:13,700
I mean...

1089
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,540
It's Plissken's advice.

1090
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:17,560
It's Plissken's advice.

1091
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,020
Who am I to...

1092
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,940
Who am I to...

1093
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:25,480
Who am I to...

1094
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,860
Who am I to...

1095
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:27,630
Go against Plissken?

1096
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,660
Extreme violence.

1097
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,200
I just want to take out the camera.

1098
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:33,800
I just want to take out the camera.

1099
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,340
I feel better without it.

1100
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,220
I also don't remember how to get through.

1101
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:40,640
I also don't remember how to get through.

1102
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,500
Is it right here?

1103
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,540
No.

1104
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:45,900
No.

1105
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,780
Can I get a hint?

1106
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:51,440
Why are these bombs always such a pain in my side?

1107
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,080
Why are these bombs always such a pain in my side?

1108
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,140
It's right there!

1109
00:52:59,210 --> 00:52:59,850
Red pipe.

1110
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:02,350
I was just over there, though.

1111
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:08,140
I was just over there, though.

1112
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,220
Ask Fat Manion.

1113
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:09,680
Ask Fat Manion.

1114
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,380
Ask Fat Manion.

1115
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,200
Wait, what do you mean, red pipe?

1116
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,100
Red pipe is the hint-o.

1117
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:18,920
Minto.

1118
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,120
Little Minto Hinto.

1119
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,540
I'm too paranoid about this guy.

1120
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:25,980
I'm too paranoid about this guy.

1121
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,560
Hey, stay down!

1122
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,120
Or you'll be staying down forever.

1123
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,200
I could take him out and then hide in the box.

1124
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:33,740
I could take him out and then hide in the box.

1125
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,400
The guy will never know.

1126
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:39,720
Well, he'll hear.

1127
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,940
He will hear.

1128
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:47,490
Red pipe.

1129
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:50,090
Red pipe.

1130
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:53,830
This one.

1131
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,160
Wait, do I crawl through here?

1132
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:09,940
I did it.

1133
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:21,810
A little lower.

1134
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:22,710
There we go.

1135
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:24,890
Stinky averted.

1136
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:25,890
This is Raiden.

1137
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:30,150
The C4 found in Strut A has been frozen and disposed of.

1138
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:30,930
How many more do I have?

1139
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:31,010
Wow.

1140
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:34,590
Explosives were planted in the pump room on the first floor.

1141
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:35,350
Yeah, crazy.

1142
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:36,370
This is all wrong.

1143
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:39,050
This is something only an amateur would do.

1144
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:40,110
What do you mean?

1145
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:44,750
All the bombs that have been found so far don't appear to be in the right kind of locations.

1146
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:46,010
They're distraction bombs.

1147
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:46,730
Probably.

1148
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,990
Even Fat Man can make mistakes, right?

1149
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:50,730
No, no.

1150
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,310
There's something else going on here.

1151
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,650
Get a move on with the disposal, right?

1152
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:56,710
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1153
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,850
Do you think it's a trap?

1154
00:54:58,110 --> 00:54:58,630
I don't know.

1155
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:01,250
But I'm going to tell Plissken to watch his back too.

1156
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:02,190
Just hurry.

1157
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:04,330
Wait, where's the next one?

1158
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:04,870
Hold on.

1159
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:05,410
Stillman.

1160
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:07,090
Will you consider streaming Unmetal?

1161
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:08,290
I've actually thought about it.

1162
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:11,070
I think I got it.

1163
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:11,530
I don't remember.

1164
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:14,270
But yeah, I would consider streaming it.

1165
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,310
No worries asking.

1166
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:17,870
Nebula, thanks for the gift.

1167
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:20,630
Well done.

1168
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:23,430
It looks like there are no more bombs in that strut.

1169
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,630
Now, head for the other struts.

1170
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:26,410
The other struts.

1171
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:27,010
Okay.

1172
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:30,170
Plissken, what are you doing?

1173
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:33,470
Me too!

1174
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:40,210
Okay.

1175
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,220
Is this guy still...

1176
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,180
Yeah, we're still good.

1177
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,000
Let's get out of here.

1178
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,420
Go to the next strut.

1179
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,040
Good night, little man.

1180
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,900
You can see all the darts in his head.

1181
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,980
Oh my god!

1182
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,760
He's going to look like a porcupine by the end.

1183
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,200
Oh my god!

1184
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,280
Pinhead.

1185
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,620
Who you calling Pinhead?

1186
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:46,570
Who you calling Pinhead?

1187
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:47,510
Who you calling Pinhead?

1188
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:48,750
Best acupuncture ever.

1189
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:50,210
Real.

1190
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:53,730
This one has some guys, don't it?

1191
00:56:58,050 --> 00:56:59,530
Oh, that's coolant.

1192
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:00,710
Oh, that's coolant.

1193
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:03,970
That's coolant.

1194
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:06,870
Let's not get caught by the...

1195
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:09,910
Let's not get caught by the...

1196
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:11,610
Is he going to come up on this end?

1197
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:12,490
Oh my gosh.

1198
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:14,890
Hi!

1199
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:18,050
Where is he?

1200
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:22,800
Where'd he go?

1201
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:26,900
There he is.

1202
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,800
Uh... uh...

1203
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,220
Dang it.

1204
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,840
I can't shoot it.

1205
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,440
I can't shoot it.

1206
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,700
Because I'll hear it.

1207
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,560
I think he'll... I think he'll...

1208
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,200
I think he'll panic.

1209
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,720
I should reach if I spray long enough.

1210
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,000
The wind will carry it.

1211
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,300
The wind will carry it all the way.

1212
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,900
No, I can't do it.

1213
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,340
It's no good.

1214
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,120
Oh, there we go.

1215
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,360
Oh, come on!

1216
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:58,700
There we go.

1217
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:00,960
And uh...

1218
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:06,680
Can I...

1219
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,860
Oh, come on!

1220
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:15,890
I always...

1221
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:17,330
We were right there.

1222
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,070
Oh my god, please!

1223
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:19,590
Shoot!

1224
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:23,530
There we go.

1225
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:25,590
Sometimes that happens to me.

1226
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:26,210
Where I...

1227
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:30,270
try to...

1228
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:31,990
hit it and it...

1229
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:34,150
doesn't decide to go.

1230
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:35,490
Rookie mistake.

1231
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:37,150
I know.

1232
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,720
Perfect time for some pull-ups.

1233
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,840
I'm already...

1234
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,500
You know what?

1235
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,240
I think I'll top off my life...

1236
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:51,960
and we'll grab this.

1237
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:54,340
Nice.

1238
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,840
Let's go look for...

1239
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,600
some more stinky.

1240
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,420
What was this?

1241
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,380
Oh, oh no.

1242
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,560
No, wait.

1243
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,400
I hate this area.

1244
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,320
I hate this area.

1245
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,060
I hate this area.

1246
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,760
I hate this area.

1247
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,340
I hate this area.

1248
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:16,900
Shoot.

1249
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,640
No, I hate this room.

1250
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,540
What card do I have?

1251
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,900
Oh, just level one.

1252
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:23,300
Okay.

1253
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,520
Oh gosh.

1254
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,200
I don't even have...

1255
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,400
I don't even have the nerd here.

1256
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,280
I don't even have the nerd here.

1257
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,340
I don't even have the nerd here.

1258
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:33,760
Nothing here.

1259
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,120
Nothing here.

1260
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:47,430
Permission to backseat?

1261
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:48,230
Granted.

1262
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:52,730
Nothing here.

1263
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:55,950
Backseating.

1264
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:57,050
Permission granted.

1265
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:58,050
Is he gonna come back?

1266
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:01,130
I need the nerd.

1267
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,000
No help.

1268
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,780
I didn't ask you.

1269
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,400
Actually, what if I...

1270
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,080
Hold on.

1271
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:24,430
Backseat tip.

1272
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:25,350
Don't get spotted.

1273
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:31,670
This guy is still out.

1274
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:33,170
Not gonna lie.

1275
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:34,570
I just ran out here.

1276
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:35,870
Completely forgot about him.

1277
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,310
I didn't even think about this guy.

1278
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:40,530
He was not even on my radar.

1279
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:41,410
I'm the worst.

1280
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:43,730
I'm the worst at sneaking.

1281
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:56,590
He's gonna get caught.

1282
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:58,010
Oh my god.

1283
01:00:58,070 --> 01:00:58,370
What the?

1284
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:00,410
How did you not get caught?

1285
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:01,110
How did you not get put to sleep?

1286
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:04,150
Now I know the smell is...

1287
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:04,470
Yeah.

1288
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:05,810
I know where it's at.

1289
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:08,750
Gosh.

1290
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:09,470
Okay.

1291
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:12,850
This room is such a pain.

1292
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,110
Oh my god.

1293
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:16,610
This room is such a pain in the neck.

1294
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:17,990
I have to...

1295
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,290
Wait.

1296
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:19,070
He's gonna say...

1297
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:19,750
Hey.

1298
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:21,470
Why aren't you reporting?

1299
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:25,250
Why aren't you reporting in the room?

1300
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:26,070
Hey.

1301
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:27,650
Somebody go check it out.

1302
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:29,090
That's what's gonna happen.

1303
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:30,570
Oh my gosh.

1304
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:31,390
I hate this room.

1305
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:34,370
I hate this room so much.

1306
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:42,870
They don't see me just...

1307
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,950
aiming my gun everywhere right now.

1308
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:49,490
This

1309
01:01:59,400 --> 01:01:59,680
room.

1310
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,340
I hate this room.

1311
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:01,220
I hate this room.

1312
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,880
Can I take out his...

1313
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:05,520
But I think I'm gonna get...

1314
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,240
Oh wait.

1315
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:07,700
I have to take out the other guy.

1316
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:08,820
Oh gosh.

1317
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:10,100
I wish I took out the other guy.

1318
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,600
Because then I could run around and take out their...

1319
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,360
Get their...

1320
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:15,640
Their radios.

1321
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,760
You can just chaff radio.

1322
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:20,440
Wait.

1323
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:20,680
Really?

1324
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:21,300
Wait.

1325
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,460
So if I chaff it...

1326
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:24,440
while they try to communicate...

1327
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:24,820
You can?

1328
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,480
Oh my gosh.

1329
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:29,480
Wait.

1330
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,560
I gotta get this guy.

1331
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,020
Dig in.

1332
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:32,720
Yeah.

1333
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:32,880
Yeah.

1334
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:33,660
This is good actually.

1335
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:35,460
Get him.

1336
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:36,380
Get his ass.

1337
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,340
There we go.

1338
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:37,680
Okay.

1339
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,300
And I'm gonna chaff...

1340
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:42,480
I think that's everybody in here.

1341
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:47,340
Is that everybody in here?

1342
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:52,180
Is that everybody in here?

1343
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:53,240
Can I still take out their radios?

1344
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:56,400
I don't know that.

1345
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:57,020
Oh it did.

1346
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:57,260
It did.

1347
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:57,540
It worked.

1348
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:57,740
It worked.

1349
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,360
Just so when the chaff is over...

1350
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:10,720
Oh wait.

1351
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:11,140
Where is he?

1352
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:12,360
Where did he go?

1353
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:12,840
Where...

1354
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:13,620
Oh they're over here.

1355
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:13,840
Over here.

1356
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:16,280
It's okay.

1357
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:16,620
It's okay.

1358
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:18,920
Ah, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

1359
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:19,660
No, no, no!

1360
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,320
Chop, chop, chop!

1361
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:31,300
Noooo!!!

1362
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:33,840
What?!

1363
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,540
You guys lied to me.

1364
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,720
You guys lied to me, you guys lied to me, you guys lied to me.

1365
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:40,840
You all lied to me!

1366
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,360
You lie!

1367
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,920
You lied to me, you!

1368
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,400
I'll never forgive you, I'll never, I'll never ever, I'll never forgive you guys.

1369
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,840
Guys, I'll never forgive you.

1370
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,040
I'll never forgive you.

1371
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:57,780
I'll never forgive you.

1372
01:03:57,820 --> 01:03:58,580
I'll never forgive you!

1373
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:44,040
I need to actually calm down.

1374
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:47,180
I'm so... I'm so mad at you guys!

1375
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,740
Oh my god, I'm so mad at you guys.

1376
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,900
You guys, I had that room clean.

1377
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:01,820
I had that room clean!

1378
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,140
It was so clean and that...

1379
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,360
It was so clean.

1380
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,240
It was so clean!

1381
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,900
Oh gosh, I was doing so well.

1382
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,900
You were doing it right but the chaff wore off.

1383
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:31,400
No, no!

1384
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,140
It was still up!

1385
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,940
It was still up while it called!

1386
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:36,840
I'm so mad.

1387
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:37,900
I'm so mad.

1388
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,900
Hold on, I gotta take a walk.

1389
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,200
Wait, I was already paused.

1390
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:43,140
I gotta take a walk!

1391
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,220
I'm back.

1392
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:51,280
I'm back.

1393
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:53,580
I'm back.

1394
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:58,220
I'm convinced that the Patriots were in my chat and were...

1395
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,980
So it wasn't you guys, it was the Patriots.

1396
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:05,520
Don't worry.

1397
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:09,140
I believe you.

1398
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,800
I'm sorry.

1399
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:22,110
Oh, I'm gonna have to go in there.

1400
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:24,170
But for now, we're not gonna go in there.

1401
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:24,970
Screw that room.

1402
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:27,270
I'm gonna take out this guy up there.

1403
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:27,850
Can I...

1404
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:28,550
Oh wait.

1405
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:29,450
Wrong gun.

1406
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,040
Can I hit him from here?

1407
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,440
Can I get his tiny little peeny head?

1408
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,940
Teeny tiny head?

1409
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:42,880
What am I doing?

1410
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,780
Sniper Minto at it again.

1411
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,640
Oh, who's calling me?

1412
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:54,480
Be careful.

1413
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,400
There are claymore mines around there.

1414
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,380
Who is this?

1415
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:57,980
Who is this?

1416
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,200
Stealth-equipped claymore mines.

1417
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:01,740
Invisible to the naked eye.

1418
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:02,060
Oh.

1419
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:03,160
Use the mine detector.

1420
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:04,840
Identify yourself.

1421
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,480
Just call me Deep Throat.

1422
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,300
Oh my god.

1423
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:08,640
Deep Throat?

1424
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,220
You mean from Shadow Moses?

1425
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:11,100
From Shadow Moses!

1426
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,120
Mr. X then.

1427
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,900
Mr. X now, is it?

1428
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:17,000
Why would it matter if I called you Deep Throat?

1429
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,620
Never mind about that.

1430
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:19,140
Okay.

1431
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:20,640
Why did you contact me?

1432
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,480
Let's just say I'm one of your fans.

1433
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:24,100
Stop.

1434
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,840
You can't use his line too.

1435
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:26,320
Oh.

1436
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:27,080
Hello?

1437
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:30,700
Colonel, someone calling himself Mr. X just contacted me.

1438
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,380
Call him by his name, right?

1439
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:33,500
And it's Deep Throat.

1440
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,600
And whoever it was, it wasn't a burst transmission.

1441
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:39,880
The transmission was sent from within the big shell.

1442
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,640
He called himself Deep Throat at first.

1443
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:42,980
Yeah.

1444
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,600
Do you think I caught that part too?

1445
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:49,000
But the possibility of it being true is none.

1446
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:49,800
It's Gray Fox.

1447
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,260
Gray Fox.

1448
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:50,820
No!

1449
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,080
Gray Fox!

1450
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:53,640
Gray Fox!

1451
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:54,440
Gray Fox!

1452
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:54,840
No, it's not!

1453
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,140
Not in my heart.

1454
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:58,960
Extreme caution.

1455
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,280
Extreme caution.

1456
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:04,580
Do I have a mind detector?

1457
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,860
I don't even have a mind detector.

1458
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:10,160
Oh wait, I have thermal goggles.

1459
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,060
Oh gosh.

1460
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,300
Oh my god.

1461
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,480
Wait, I have a question.

1462
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,300
Actually I don't know if I can trust you guys.

1463
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,760
I have a question.

1464
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,600
If I crawl... wait, it's only in 5, right?

1465
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:26,680
That if I crawl, it blows up?

1466
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:28,820
Oh, thank goodness.

1467
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:30,680
My eyes!

1468
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:32,020
You know what?

1469
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:32,560
Screw it.

1470
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:33,180
I'm just gonna crawl.

1471
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,040
And I'll go this way.

1472
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:40,720
I'll go this way.

1473
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:43,080
Keep going.

1474
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:51,190
Wait.

1475
01:10:51,190 --> 01:10:51,630
Okay.

1476
01:10:53,030 --> 01:10:54,210
My eyes!

1477
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:55,270
My eyes!

1478
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:58,290
Okay, and then there's a bomb in here.

1479
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:02,290
Is this also the room that I hate?

1480
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:04,090
No, I think that's the middle one.

1481
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:07,770
Or is it this one?

1482
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:08,430
A parcel room.

1483
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:13,050
This one... I

1484
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:20,590
think this room was pretty okay.

1485
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:25,420
I don't remember.

1486
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,220
I don't remember where the bomb... I know there's two guys.

1487
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,400
Right?

1488
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,040
It's just the two?

1489
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,220
Nothing here.

1490
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,360
Status report.

1491
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,080
I gotta shoot his butt.

1492
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,040
Okay, hold on.

1493
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:48,080
Can he see me?

1494
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:48,480
No.

1495
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:57,580
Once he goes back, I'm gonna try and get this guy out first.

1496
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:16,490
The boxes!

1497
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:18,590
I was too slow.

1498
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:19,370
Oh, shoot.

1499
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:19,970
Oh, shoot.

1500
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:20,410
Oh, shoot.

1501
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:21,010
Oh, shoot.

1502
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:21,310
Oh, shoot.

1503
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:22,990
Where does he come from?

1504
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:24,730
I think he's gonna see me.

1505
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:31,380
He's yawnin'.

1506
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,380
He's stretchin'.

1507
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,120
The other guy's asleep!

1508
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:34,700
Hey, hey.

1509
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:49,180
Freeze.

1510
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,180
Oh my god.

1511
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:54,600
Oh my god.

1512
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:58,460
Oh my god.

1513
01:12:58,460 --> 01:12:59,300
Oh my god.

1514
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:11,170
Oh my god.

1515
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:11,970
You know what?

1516
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:13,670
I'm not... I'm not doing this again.

1517
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:14,290
Sorry.

1518
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:15,310
I'm a murderer now.

1519
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:16,930
This is... this is me now.

1520
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:17,830
I'm a murderer.

1521
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:19,090
I'm a murderer.

1522
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:20,610
I'm a murderer!

1523
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:25,310
Sorry, mister.

1524
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:27,230
Oh.

1525
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:27,870
Stun grenade.

1526
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:33,830
You enjoy all the killing.

1527
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:35,290
Is that a radio?

1528
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:37,630
Or is that just him?

1529
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:39,810
I think he's just got a thick butt.

1530
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:41,310
Sorry.

1531
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:41,990
Okay.

1532
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:42,610
Sorry, buddy.

1533
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:43,070
Anyway.

1534
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:44,990
Time to find a bomb.

1535
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:46,370
Oh.

1536
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:46,850
My bad.

1537
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:47,110
Oh.

1538
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:48,910
Wrong thing.

1539
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:49,390
Wrong thing.

1540
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:52,150
What?

1541
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:54,090
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1542
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:55,490
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1543
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:56,350
I shot the radio!

1544
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:57,030
I shot the radio!

1545
01:13:57,410 --> 01:13:58,630
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1546
01:13:58,850 --> 01:13:59,650
I shot the radio!

1547
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:03,690
Um.

1548
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:16,350
Maybe they won't come.

1549
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:22,070
Damn it.

1550
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:23,110
Uh-oh.

1551
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:29,740
Hold on.

1552
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:31,740
Oh.

1553
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:32,560
Not so fast, huh?

1554
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,180
Not so fast, huh?

1555
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:36,720
realizing

1556
01:14:44,900 --> 01:15:01,860
so fast.

1557
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:09,440
What do you mean that wasn't the radio?

1558
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,820
I thought he just had a fat ass.

1559
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:20,540
That guy never even sent in a status report.

1560
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,840
That guy never even lifted his radio even once.

1561
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:28,360
That guy never even gave two flips about his radio.

1562
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,680
And now suddenly you care about the status report.

1563
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:36,160
Why are you telling me this now?

1564
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,620
And I'm facing the wall.

1565
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,160
Do you think I'm safe?

1566
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:51,140
I can't see anything.

1567
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:57,740
I think I can get the nerd at least.

1568
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:00,900
There we go.

1569
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:05,340
This game terrifies me.

1570
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:08,080
It's too advanced for my P-Brain.

1571
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,240
It's too advanced for my P-Brain, for real.

1572
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,260
Goodness gracious.

1573
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:21,140
Wait, did they not... did they only replace the one guy?

1574
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,640
I think they only replaced the one guy.

1575
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,560
They didn't notice the other one?

1576
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:36,960
You understand how smart you are?

1577
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:38,120
Stay strong, Ghost Maid.

1578
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,080
Thank you.

1579
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:42,760
Nothing here.

1580
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:51,500
Wait, I'm scared of taking him out though.

1581
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,060
Okay, hold on.

1582
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:54,660
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

1583
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:56,020
There's somebody there.

1584
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:56,420
No.

1585
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,100
Nobody here.

1586
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:00,480
Nobody here.

1587
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:01,900
I'm just going to box it.

1588
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:05,980
Oh wait, he's going to see the other dead guy!

1589
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:07,920
Oh, never mind.

1590
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:08,680
He doesn't care.

1591
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:14,620
These guys!

1592
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:18,960
These guys... These guys are ridiculous, I swear.

1593
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,360
They're so silly.

1594
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:24,300
I love... I love these Gerlukovich soldiers.

1595
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:25,660
They're so dumb.

1596
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,220
Okay, you know what?

1597
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,540
I'm just gonna try and find the bomb.

1598
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:41,480
Nothing here... I wanna get that cardboard box, though.

1599
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:51,490
If I shoot his radio, and then... will he notice?

1600
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:55,730
Let's go upstairs.

1601
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:03,180
Nothing... Where's this lead to?

1602
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:04,360
Hold on, I don't wanna go out yet.

1603
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,180
I think he'll hear.

1604
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:11,660
If I just... take him out...

1605
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:25,310
I'm on the right place, right?

1606
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:26,390
Yeah, there's a bomb in here.

1607
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:26,690
Somewhere.

1608
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:28,670
Ask Plissken.

1609
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:29,870
What does Plissken gotta say?

1610
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:31,870
That guy's so smart.

1611
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:46,370
He's so smart!

1612
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:52,610
He's so smart.

1613
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:54,070
Smart guy.

1614
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:57,730
You know what?

1615
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:58,490
Do I go downstairs?

1616
01:18:58,790 --> 01:18:59,750
I can't remember where it's at.

1617
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:01,270
Come on, Raiden.

1618
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:02,170
Back...

1619
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:04,630
Raiden.

1620
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:05,070
Raiden.

1621
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,220
Is it downstairs?

1622
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:21,140
Nothing here...

1623
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:27,330
No, but this is where the... Oh, there's the mine detector!

1624
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:31,290
No, I can't go through there yet.

1625
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:33,010
And I can't go through there yet.

1626
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:34,150
I guess we go upstairs?

1627
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,520
When you know, but you don't want to help.

1628
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:50,020
It's these little things though, like these details I forget so much, you know?

1629
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:00,820
Wait, um...

1630
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:02,980
No...

1631
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:07,220
I thought I remembered, but I don't.

1632
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:10,560
I thought I remembered, but I do not.

1633
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,440
Nothing here...

1634
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,640
I don't remember.

1635
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:17,920
The heliport.

1636
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:24,450
This is...

1637
01:20:25,470 --> 01:20:26,510
Another place.

1638
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:29,070
This is...

1639
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:29,830
Wait...

1640
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:32,950
We're not about to experience this part, are we?

1641
01:20:34,690 --> 01:20:36,770
Do a Frogbert codec call.

1642
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:38,250
What do you mean by that?

1643
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:43,570
I've taken care of that annoying fly.

1644
01:20:43,870 --> 01:20:45,110
What's the situation over there?

1645
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:45,930
Buzzing.

1646
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:48,250
I saw a man dressed like a ninja just now.

1647
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:48,590
Mmm!

1648
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:50,330
Ninja?

1649
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:52,730
It's the only way to describe it.

1650
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:55,210
A kind of cyborg ninja, complete with a sword.

1651
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:56,490
What?

1652
01:20:58,510 --> 01:21:00,390
Are you hiding something from me?

1653
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:04,110
Olga, are you sure it wasn't an Arsenal Tengu?

1654
01:21:04,510 --> 01:21:05,830
Arsenal Tengu?

1655
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:06,750
Don't be a fool.

1656
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:08,350
Think I wouldn't know the difference?

1657
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:10,670
I've never seen field gear like that, ever.

1658
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:12,890
Alright, we'll intensify patrols.

1659
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:13,770
Anything else?

1660
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:15,410
Actually, one more thing.

1661
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:17,310
You'll find it hard to believe, though.

1662
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:17,790
What's that?

1663
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,850
I saw a man hiding under a cardboard box.

1664
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:20,350
Where?

1665
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:21,730
It wasn't me.

1666
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:23,190
It wasn't me.

1667
01:21:23,970 --> 01:21:25,550
So you believe me this time.

1668
01:21:25,690 --> 01:21:27,350
What the hell is an Arsenal Tengu?

1669
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:33,690
Like I know what a Tengu is.

1670
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:36,250
Oh my gosh.

1671
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:39,370
You must be one of Dead Cell.

1672
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:40,690
Of course not.

1673
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:41,670
What a thing to say.

1674
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:44,250
Drop your gun.

1675
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:47,790
Olga, so I saw...

1676
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:47,850
Oh!

1677
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:55,150
Where'd she go?

1678
01:21:59,530 --> 01:22:00,570
She did a flip.

1679
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:02,630
She's so cool.

1680
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:12,070
I saw a female soldier.

1681
01:22:12,450 --> 01:22:12,930
Russian.

1682
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:14,950
Must be Olga Gerlukovich.

1683
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:15,930
How do you know?

1684
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:18,470
Unlike you, I've been briefed.

1685
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:19,710
She's not a Dead Cell?

1686
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:20,410
No.

1687
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:22,470
She commands a Russian private army.

1688
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:23,170
What's that supposed to mean?

1689
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:24,970
They must be the ones patrolling the Big Shell.

1690
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:26,350
What's that supposed to mean?

1691
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:26,570
That's right.

1692
01:22:26,570 --> 01:22:29,570
She's led the group ever since her old man, Colonel Gerlukovich, died.

1693
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:31,190
Watch yourself with her.

1694
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:32,410
She's a tough one.

1695
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:33,130
No.

1696
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:34,630
No.

1697
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:37,650
What's that supposed to mean?

1698
01:22:39,010 --> 01:22:39,870
So aggressive.

1699
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:43,970
Oh, there are guys here.

1700
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:48,650
Let's have our other gun out.

1701
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:52,490
Can they see me here?

1702
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,390
Oh, there's two of them.

1703
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:05,620
Where's the other guy?

1704
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:06,680
Hello?

1705
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:07,520
Hello?

1706
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:08,280
Hello?

1707
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,140
Hello?

1708
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:23,620
I'm a natural.

1709
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,500
Wait, do these guys have radios?

1710
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:27,800
I'm so paranoid.

1711
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:31,680
I'm so paranoid of radios.

1712
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:37,380
I think it usually happens like immediately though, right?

1713
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,780
Oh, can I flip you?

1714
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:40,800
Oh, wait.

1715
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:41,240
Is this it?

1716
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:41,820
Oh, that's it.

1717
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:42,360
Is it?

1718
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,100
Is it?

1719
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:45,680
Oh, my bad.

1720
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:46,040
Sorry.

1721
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:46,500
Sorry.

1722
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,360
This is it.

1723
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:48,620
No.

1724
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:49,040
No.

1725
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:49,260
Sorry.

1726
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:49,640
My bad.

1727
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:50,100
Sorry.

1728
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:51,300
This is it.

1729
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,100
This is it.

1730
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,380
Nope.

1731
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:54,600
Where is the radio?

1732
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:55,840
Is this it?

1733
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:19,540
Sorry.

1734
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:23,820
Sorry, mister.

1735
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:26,400
I was just trying to find a radio.

1736
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:29,200
Sorry.

1737
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:30,900
Um...

1738
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:31,840
Uh...

1739
01:24:37,730 --> 01:24:38,710
We gotta hide the body.

1740
01:24:39,070 --> 01:24:40,310
We gotta get rid of the body.

1741
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:41,370
They won't notice.

1742
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:42,390
They won't care about the blood.

1743
01:24:42,690 --> 01:24:43,490
We gotta get rid...

1744
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:45,110
We gotta throw them into the ocean.

1745
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:48,750
We gotta get rid of...

1746
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,090
We gotta get rid of the body.

1747
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:52,010
I didn't... I didn't...

1748
01:24:54,670 --> 01:24:55,350
I thought...

1749
01:24:57,070 --> 01:24:58,670
There has to be a way to flip them over?

1750
01:24:58,850 --> 01:24:59,630
I don't know how.

1751
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:01,790
Oh, dang it.

1752
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:06,780
Is there a way to flip them over?

1753
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:07,860
Or...

1754
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:09,320
You know...

1755
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:12,460
Dang.

1756
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,580
This whole ship is stinky.

1757
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:15,100
I mean...

1758
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:16,600
This whole...

1759
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,540
Aircraft is stinky.

1760
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:27,510
Whatever.

1761
01:25:27,810 --> 01:25:28,190
Okay.

1762
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:31,630
Probably will have to lay down.

1763
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,200
I don't hear anything.

1764
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,640
This smells like ship.

1765
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,000
Beep.

1766
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:50,700
Beep.

1767
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:51,440
Beep.

1768
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:52,380
Beep.

1769
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:53,520
Beep.

1770
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:55,340
Beep.

1771
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:55,960
Beep.

1772
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:56,320
Beep.

1773
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:56,440
Beep.

1774
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,020
Oh, there it is.

1775
01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:02,510
Can I reach?

1776
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:03,350
Hold on.

1777
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:04,050
Let's get in closer.

1778
01:26:04,230 --> 01:26:04,690
Oh.

1779
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:07,570
There we go.

1780
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:08,970
Oh.

1781
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:10,170
I can't reach?

1782
01:26:10,510 --> 01:26:11,250
Just kidding.

1783
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:11,970
There...

1784
01:26:11,970 --> 01:26:12,850
That should be good.

1785
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:16,110
That should reach it?

1786
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:18,010
Perfect!

1787
01:26:18,010 --> 01:26:18,090
Perfect!

1788
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:21,450
Alright.

1789
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:23,110
That takes care of that.

1790
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:25,450
Did you have anything for me?

1791
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:46,080
I think I saw that there's a guy over here.

1792
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:48,640
Right here.

1793
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:50,440
Isn't there?

1794
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:51,120
Yeah.

1795
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:52,740
Let's ignore him.

1796
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:53,880
And...

1797
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:54,560
Run away.

1798
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:59,180
We don't need to talk to that guy.

1799
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:00,360
We can...

1800
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,300
Ignore him.

1801
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:02,460
And run away.

1802
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,180
We can just...

1803
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:06,900
Ignore him.

1804
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:09,480
Oh.

1805
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:10,080
Yes?

1806
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:12,780
Yeah.

1807
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:13,440
I didn't hear the gun.

1808
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:13,720
Jack.

1809
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:15,000
Do you remember the day we met?

1810
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,000
I'm kind of busy right now, Rose.

1811
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:17,740
Yeah.

1812
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:18,720
Yeah.

1813
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,660
Keep going.

1814
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:20,080
I do remember.

1815
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:22,520
It was right after I transferred to New York.

1816
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:24,840
There are all these tourists around you.

1817
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,020
In front of the federal hall.

1818
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:26,700
Oh my gosh.

1819
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:27,380
It's starting.

1820
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:28,120
It's starting.

1821
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:32,340
A group of middle-aged Japanese ladies came up and asked me which building it was that King Kong was climbing in the movie.

1822
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,900
I said it was probably the Chrysler building.

1823
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,400
And then you, um, actually me.

1824
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:37,700
And then you showed up and started mouthing off.

1825
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,340
You were like, no, it's the Empire State.

1826
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:40,640
Yeah.

1827
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:41,180
Dummy.

1828
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:41,800
Dummy.

1829
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:42,960
Stupid woman.

1830
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,640
It's the Empire State Building.

1831
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:47,500
We started arguing and I forgot all about the tourists.

1832
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:50,980
I was insisting that I was right and you were doing the same.

1833
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:54,320
The next thing we knew, the Japanese women had gone away.

1834
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,920
Yeah, because I don't want to listen to two people bickering.

1835
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:58,820
To see who had the better recall.

1836
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:00,740
We argued all the way to New York.

1837
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:01,500
We had a battery park.

1838
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:02,780
And for nothing.

1839
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:08,920
Since the museum was closed, we went our separate ways from the museum.

1840
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:09,960
I love this version, though.

1841
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,780
And then I found you again by coincidence out in the base corridor.

1842
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:17,620
An amazing coincidence that we were actually working at the same place.

1843
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:19,520
Yeah, coincidence.

1844
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:22,200
It was so beautiful.

1845
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:22,580
Yeah.

1846
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:27,040
I could look down on the Chrysler Building from 120 stories above ground.

1847
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:28,980
I felt overwhelmed.

1848
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:30,640
I didn't care.

1849
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:30,740
I didn't care.

1850
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:31,920
I didn't care anymore who was right.

1851
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:34,340
Yeah, I would hope not after that much time.

1852
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,360
You watched King Kong in your apartment a bunch of times that night.

1853
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:37,880
Oh, I bet.

1854
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:39,560
Didn't sleep till morning.

1855
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:43,960
If it weren't for that coincidence, we wouldn't be together.

1856
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,040
I know.

1857
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,580
I'm sorry, Jack.

1858
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:47,940
I'm taking up your time again.

1859
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:48,760
Yeah.

1860
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:48,780
What?

1861
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:49,740
Take care.

1862
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,320
No, Rose!

1863
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:52,200
Keep calling me!

1864
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:52,800
Please!

1865
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:53,600
Please!

1866
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:54,400
I eat it up!

1867
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:54,800
Please!

1868
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:57,500
Oh, my gosh.

1869
01:28:58,420 --> 01:29:00,740
Jack, do you remember the day we first met?

1870
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:02,840
Rose, please.

1871
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:04,580
There are bombs.

1872
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:05,740
There are literal bombs.

1873
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:06,700
I am defusing.

1874
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,140
I am bomb defusing right now.

1875
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,000
Rose!

1876
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:13,160
Am I wrong for kind of liking Rose, Jack?

1877
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:13,520
No!

1878
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,980
They're my favorite couple ever.

1879
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,800
I love them.

1880
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:18,820
I love them.

1881
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:19,940
Women.

1882
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:21,360
Yeah, he comes up.

1883
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:21,980
He just comes up.

1884
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:22,500
Can you imagine?

1885
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:27,500
I just imagine her being like, hmm, to these like group of like very unassuming women.

1886
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:28,300
They're just like, oh.

1887
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:29,560
Rose, no comment.

1888
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:30,340
About?

1889
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:30,660
Oh!

1890
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:30,720
Oh!

1891
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:31,740
I've killed someone.

1892
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:33,500
Jack, it's a battlefield.

1893
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:36,920
My opponents are living, breathing human beings.

1894
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:39,000
This isn't like the VR training.

1895
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,420
They have bodies.

1896
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:42,960
They have had lives.

1897
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:45,620
I took all that away from them.

1898
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,180
But you've got no choice if you want to survive.

1899
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:49,140
Yeah.

1900
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:49,200
Yeah.

1901
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:54,260
And yet, maybe because of the VR training, I can't help but try and block out that reality.

1902
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:54,920
I killed a person.

1903
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:57,080
It's the only way I can manage to fight.

1904
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:57,700
Jack.

1905
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:59,320
I didn't mean to kill them.

1906
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:00,220
I don't care what it takes.

1907
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:00,720
Just a little bit.

1908
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,140
Just as long as you come back alive.

1909
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:02,800
The first two, yes.

1910
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:03,880
But not that last guy.

1911
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:04,580
Do whatever it takes, please.

1912
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:06,760
Just come back in one piece.

1913
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:07,840
In one piece.

1914
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:08,800
Okay.

1915
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:10,540
Um.

1916
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:12,680
Oh, yeah.

1917
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:13,120
I can...

1918
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:17,780
Can you just imagine like these ladies that are just like, oh, sumimasen.

1919
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:19,460
Excuse me.

1920
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:22,100
Do you know which building was King Kong?

1921
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,640
And she's just like, hmm.

1922
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:25,620
I'm pretty sure it was the Chrysler building.

1923
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,380
And I just see his head whipping around.

1924
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:27,980
He's just like.

1925
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:28,380
Oh.

1926
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:29,140
Oh.

1927
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:30,200
Oh.

1928
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:30,700
Oh.

1929
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:32,740
You stupid woman.

1930
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:34,780
The Chrysler building.

1931
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,500
It is the Empire State Building.

1932
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:39,360
You stupid idiot.

1933
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:44,980
Why would you say it's the Chrysler building when everybody knows it's the Empire State Building?

1934
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:47,680
She's like huffing and puffing and she's just like, whoa, man.

1935
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,460
She's just like, you don't have to be so rude.

1936
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:51,580
You don't have to be so rude.

1937
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:52,500
And then they're just arguing.

1938
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:55,840
Walking along arguing and just being so angry at each other.

1939
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:57,020
Right.

1940
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,680
Stillman is a top notch explosives technician.

1941
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:00,700
Follow his instructions.

1942
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,480
Colonel, why are you being so boring?

1943
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,180
Gotcha.

1944
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:08,160
I'll look him up.

1945
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:08,960
Hold on a moment.

1946
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,700
So your earlier rant about MGS5...

1947
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:12,700
What are you even talking about?

1948
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:14,040
Wait, wait, wait.

1949
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:15,440
It's completely different.

1950
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,120
I was right.

1951
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:22,560
Me too!

1952
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:26,020
What?

1953
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:35,020
So the guy didn't notice?

1954
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,260
Well done.

1955
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,040
It looks like there are no more bombs in that strut.

1956
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:41,200
Now, head for the other struts.

1957
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:43,200
King Kong, watch along.

1958
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:43,700
When?

1959
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:46,160
We have to watch it over and over and over again.

1960
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:47,580
We can't get any sleep, you guys.

1961
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,320
Just like them.

1962
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:53,420
Just like my favorite couple.

1963
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:55,900
Is that guy still...

1964
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:58,500
Did they replace him?

1965
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,220
Or is he just still dead on the ground?

1966
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:00,780
Let's go over here.

1967
01:32:03,990 --> 01:32:05,770
Oh, he's back.

1968
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:10,630
Hold on.

1969
01:32:11,190 --> 01:32:12,230
Is he just gone?

1970
01:32:12,470 --> 01:32:13,810
They didn't replace him at all?

1971
01:32:15,690 --> 01:32:16,690
Nothing here.

1972
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:20,470
I don't think they replaced him.

1973
01:32:21,090 --> 01:32:22,210
Back from the dead?

1974
01:32:23,310 --> 01:32:23,830
Crazy.

1975
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:33,450
I'm trying to decide if I want to head back to this one and risk it all.

1976
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:37,090
It's kind of annoying because otherwise...

1977
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:38,610
I think this...

1978
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:44,920
Save F for last.

1979
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,520
Yeah, I think we'll save it for last.

1980
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,800
I'm trying to decide how I want to do it.

1981
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:50,260
But...

1982
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,300
Can I get on top of this and go as a box?

1983
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:55,440
I think that's what you can do, right?

1984
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:02,080
Jump up, ride him.

1985
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:04,620
Ask for uppies.

1986
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,220
Wait, I can't go this way though.

1987
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:07,840
Oh, it's over here.

1988
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:08,280
That's right.

1989
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:08,860
I know.

1990
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:10,300
I know the way.

1991
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:13,400
What's box 2?

1992
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:14,740
Oh, is this the zone of the Enders 1?

1993
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:16,080
Oh no.

1994
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:17,020
I think...

1995
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:18,420
Where is the zone of the Enders 1?

1996
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:21,940
Have I not gotten to that part yet?

1997
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:27,780
Bye bye.

1998
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:30,600
Uppies from Raiden.

1999
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:38,180
Ran survives a hellish childhood and becomes a functioning adult who mansplains video trivia to random women on the street.

2000
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:48,230
Is that a sniper up there?

2001
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:53,980
Yeah, you know.

2002
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:55,020
That's just Raiden...

2003
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:55,660
things.

2004
01:33:57,940 --> 01:33:59,700
Wait, how do I get rid of the sniper?

2005
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:08,500
Go away.

2006
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:09,700
Stop staring, you freak.

2007
01:34:15,790 --> 01:34:17,290
I'm trying to wait for the other guy.

2008
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:19,110
But he'll notice, won't he?

2009
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:21,710
Oh, I think I have to... Okay, it's red light, green light.

2010
01:34:23,690 --> 01:34:24,410
Green light.

2011
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:28,410
Oh, he's walking away!

2012
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:32,650
He gave up!

2013
01:34:33,890 --> 01:34:35,770
And now we can take out your friend.

2014
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:37,030
There we go.

2015
01:34:39,630 --> 01:34:41,550
But I am still gonna put on a box.

2016
01:34:41,630 --> 01:34:42,110
Just in case.

2017
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:46,180
Goodbye.

2018
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:48,660
Bye bye.

2019
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:50,180
Nice.

2020
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:53,020
Stretch the...

2021
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:53,760
Oh wait, no!

2022
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:56,000
No!

2023
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:57,480
No!

2024
01:34:59,300 --> 01:34:59,840
No!

2025
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,080
I hate this room!

2026
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,540
No!

2027
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:05,500
No, I hate this room.

2028
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,920
Okay, I was thinking this was the one in the middle.

2029
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:09,780
I hate this room!

2030
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:16,040
I hate this room!

2031
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:18,880
I know I...

2032
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,960
slightly remember where it is.

2033
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,040
It's on the other side in one of those, like...

2034
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,180
I have to...

2035
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,620
Oh, I hate this room.

2036
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:29,520
Oh, I hate this room.

2037
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,660
Oh, I hate this room!

2038
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:33,200
Because it's such a pain in the butt...

2039
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:35,000
The nerd, I think, is right underneath me.

2040
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:37,280
But it's...

2041
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:39,160
knowing when I'm safe to...

2042
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:39,600
move.

2043
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:41,480
Until then.

2044
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:44,220
Which makes it...

2045
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:45,800
Wait, where's the nerd?

2046
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,120
Nothing here.

2047
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:50,460
He sounds too close.

2048
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:51,460
Where's the nerd?

2049
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:56,300
Um...

2050
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:06,080
Ryo, I don't need you to be a smartass, okay?

2051
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:07,500
Yeah, I know I can...

2052
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:08,840
drop down, okay?

2053
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:11,400
It's still, you know...

2054
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:12,940
If I don't know their patterns...

2055
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:13,720
It's still...

2056
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:16,260
This room is also still very annoying despite that.

2057
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:17,620
And also...

2058
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,380
I think...

2059
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:22,100
I think that is right there, right?

2060
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,200
Um...

2061
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,240
I still don't know their walking patterns...

2062
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:26,880
and stuff.

2063
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:28,720
I still can't see them right now.

2064
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:30,260
So...

2065
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:33,840
Come on.

2066
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:34,540
Please.

2067
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:36,420
I

2068
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:40,840
pressed triangle!

2069
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:47,180
I love the picture of him...

2070
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:48,260
just floating in the water.

2071
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,340
Just like a dead fish.

2072
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:53,760
Nothing here...

2073
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,240
Nothing here...

2074
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:57,600
Okay, where is the nerd?

2075
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:58,140
I cannot...

2076
01:36:58,740 --> 01:37:00,900
I cannot remember where it's at...

2077
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:01,880
in this room.

2078
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:04,440
Oh, this is the PSG.

2079
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:06,760
I wasn't paying attention earlier.

2080
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:09,180
What was all that...

2081
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:10,020
grip strength for?

2082
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:15,940
Where is it?

2083
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:19,140
And there's so many guys in this room too.

2084
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:21,480
Again, it just becomes so...

2085
01:37:27,930 --> 01:37:29,410
I can't remember if he...

2086
01:37:29,410 --> 01:37:30,870
does his little walky thing.

2087
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:39,780
Nothing?

2088
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:41,060
Nobody?

2089
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:41,920
Nothing?

2090
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:45,460
Look, he has to go all the way up...

2091
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:47,200
and around...

2092
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,080
I'm just gonna run.

2093
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:50,840
Where is the nerd?

2094
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:54,340
Oh, it's down there!

2095
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:55,740
Oh, it was down there!

2096
01:37:55,780 --> 01:37:56,320
I knew it!

2097
01:37:58,780 --> 01:37:59,700
Back asleep.

2098
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:01,140
Back asleep.

2099
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:02,040
And you too.

2100
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:03,700
Damn it.

2101
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:05,000
I almost got him.

2102
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:09,060
There we go.

2103
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:10,740
But now it's gonna be...

2104
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:11,760
Where is your status report?

2105
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,300
I'm really needy.

2106
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:15,620
Why aren't you talking to me?

2107
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:17,280
Why aren't you calling me anymore?

2108
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:20,020
Why don't you message me anymore?

2109
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:23,540
Status report...

2110
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:24,520
Over.

2111
01:38:26,980 --> 01:38:28,100
Status report...

2112
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:29,440
Over.

2113
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,420
Oh, shoot.

2114
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:32,600
Wait, uh oh.

2115
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:34,220
Where is your radio?

2116
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,060
No, I don't wanna kill again!

2117
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:38,540
Um, just run.

2118
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:40,560
Just run for the nerd.

2119
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:42,560
Run for the nerd.

2120
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:43,860
Run for the nerd.

2121
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:46,220
Let's just speed run it.

2122
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,700
Run for the nerd!

2123
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:49,700
Run for the nerd!

2124
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:51,740
Run for the nerd!

2125
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:53,500
Okay.

2126
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:55,840
And uh...

2127
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:57,620
Sensor.

2128
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:58,680
It's like...

2129
01:38:59,370 --> 01:39:00,560
Down over here?

2130
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:01,800
Down over here?

2131
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:04,160
I think...

2132
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:05,620
It's somewhere...

2133
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:09,240
Is it this one?

2134
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:12,860
It was down there.

2135
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:13,740
Shoot.

2136
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:22,600
Yeah, I think it's the bottom.

2137
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:23,860
Yeah, I think it's the bottom.

2138
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,080
I think it's one below me.

2139
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:27,880
Wait, where do they come in from?

2140
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:29,960
Am I...

2141
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:32,900
I don't trust myself with dropping down though.

2142
01:39:33,380 --> 01:39:34,180
You know what?

2143
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:35,440
YOLO.

2144
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:38,360
Uh, hello?

2145
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:38,800
Raiden?

2146
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:42,760
Oh!

2147
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:43,260
It was nothing.

2148
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:44,060
All clear.

2149
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,540
Is it this one?

2150
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,020
I got it.

2151
01:39:55,340 --> 01:39:56,480
There was nothing wrong.

2152
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:57,880
Everything is alright.

2153
01:39:58,240 --> 01:39:58,620
Yep.

2154
01:40:09,070 --> 01:40:10,470
This is Raiden.

2155
01:40:11,050 --> 01:40:13,910
Disposal of the C4 in Strut D is complete.

2156
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:15,130
I hate this room.

2157
01:40:15,130 --> 01:40:17,070
Explosives were planted on the maintenance hatch.

2158
01:40:17,410 --> 01:40:19,610
Glad I slightly remembered where it was.

2159
01:40:20,950 --> 01:40:22,050
This is Plissken.

2160
01:40:22,190 --> 01:40:23,170
Do you read me, Pete?

2161
01:40:23,410 --> 01:40:23,770
Pete!

2162
01:40:25,170 --> 01:40:26,550
He's giving him nicknames.

2163
01:40:27,170 --> 01:40:27,930
I'm listening.

2164
01:40:28,510 --> 01:40:30,510
I checked out the bottom of Strut H for you, Pete.

2165
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:32,250
Wait, what's this about?

2166
01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:34,230
I asked Plissken to look around.

2167
01:40:34,230 --> 01:40:38,890
Knowing Fat Man, I can't shake the feeling that all the bombs so far were just wrong.

2168
01:40:39,010 --> 01:40:40,210
So did you find anything?

2169
01:40:40,690 --> 01:40:44,270
Yeah, a hell of a lot of C4s packed into the bottom of the Strut.

2170
01:40:44,450 --> 01:40:45,650
Pete called it right.

2171
01:40:45,710 --> 01:40:46,390
Were these distractions?

2172
01:40:46,630 --> 01:40:47,990
I knew he had the real thing up his sleeve.

2173
01:40:48,270 --> 01:40:50,190
So all the other ones were dummies?

2174
01:40:50,230 --> 01:40:50,650
Dummies!

2175
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:52,330
Oh, never mind.

2176
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:53,170
They're real.

2177
01:40:53,410 --> 01:40:55,330
But the detonation wouldn't be enough to destroy the entire shell.

2178
01:40:55,410 --> 01:40:59,190
But the C4s Plissken found would inflict serious structural damage.

2179
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:01,090
That's not the bad news either.

2180
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:02,550
These are sensor proof.

2181
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:03,330
What?

2182
01:41:04,230 --> 01:41:04,950
It's a new model, I guess.

2183
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:07,830
But how did you find them then?

2184
01:41:07,870 --> 01:41:09,970
The whole thing is sealed tight to prevent vapor leak.

2185
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:11,910
And there's no trace of that cologne signature.

2186
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:12,350
Uh oh.

2187
01:41:12,530 --> 01:41:14,370
Pete, looks like he fooled you.

2188
01:41:14,710 --> 01:41:15,190
Yes.

2189
01:41:16,410 --> 01:41:18,570
But you managed to find the thing anyway.

2190
01:41:18,950 --> 01:41:20,070
With sheer luck.

2191
01:41:20,650 --> 01:41:22,670
Bombs that are invisible to the sensor?

2192
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:24,090
He used R1.

2193
01:41:25,190 --> 01:41:26,150
Hidden R1.

2194
01:41:26,970 --> 01:41:28,630
You can't move fast enough.

2195
01:41:28,930 --> 01:41:29,550
He's right.

2196
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:31,530
I can try the spray from a distance.

2197
01:41:31,530 --> 01:41:32,390
Hold on.

2198
01:41:32,690 --> 01:41:34,550
There's something not right about this one.

2199
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:35,170
I can feel it.

2200
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:35,470
Uh oh.

2201
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:37,450
Well, Pete, should I come back and get you?

2202
01:41:37,610 --> 01:41:37,830
No.

2203
01:41:38,110 --> 01:41:38,810
There's no need.

2204
01:41:39,290 --> 01:41:41,050
Ryden, you have one left to go, correct?

2205
01:41:41,070 --> 01:41:41,410
Yes.

2206
01:41:41,630 --> 01:41:43,490
Except for those scentless ones.

2207
01:41:43,850 --> 01:41:44,890
How about you, Plissken?

2208
01:41:45,110 --> 01:41:46,170
I have two left.

2209
01:41:46,470 --> 01:41:48,110
Hey, Plissken, come on.

2210
01:41:48,110 --> 01:41:48,690
Pick it up.

2211
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:49,470
Pick up the pace, buddy.

2212
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:50,290
It'll have to be me.

2213
01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:53,950
I have the level 4 card that'll get me into shell 2 in any case.

2214
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:55,410
You'll never make it.

2215
01:41:56,350 --> 01:41:57,610
You'll never make it.

2216
01:41:58,650 --> 01:41:59,790
You'll never make it.

2217
01:42:00,670 --> 01:42:02,790
You'll never make it.

2218
01:42:03,190 --> 01:42:04,170
You'll never make it.

2219
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:05,990
You'll never make it.

2220
01:42:06,070 --> 01:42:06,450
Wait, what?

2221
01:42:06,730 --> 01:42:08,810
That bomb, five years ago...

2222
01:42:09,230 --> 01:42:10,130
I messed up.

2223
01:42:10,330 --> 01:42:12,670
Even with all my experience, I lost it.

2224
01:42:13,150 --> 01:42:14,730
And a church was lost in explosion.

2225
01:42:15,150 --> 01:42:17,170
All those kids playing nearby too.

2226
01:42:17,390 --> 01:42:20,210
These past five years, I've lived a lie.

2227
01:42:20,610 --> 01:42:21,170
Lied?

2228
01:42:21,410 --> 01:42:21,950
Yes.

2229
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:25,390
I didn't lose my leg in the explosion.

2230
01:42:26,490 --> 01:42:27,930
Pete Stillman!

2231
01:42:28,150 --> 01:42:29,770
Peter Stillman!

2232
01:42:39,590 --> 01:42:42,970
You wanted people to feel sorry for you?!

2233
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:45,070
After people died?!

2234
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:47,570
Oh my god.

2235
01:42:51,410 --> 01:42:53,110
Oh my god!

2236
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:55,210
This guy is...

2237
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:56,810
Peter!

2238
01:42:57,910 --> 01:43:00,370
Peter Stillman, you are ashamed.

2239
01:43:00,630 --> 01:43:01,770
I'm ashamed, I'm...

2240
01:43:01,770 --> 01:43:04,050
That hurts.

2241
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:05,390
That hurts!

2242
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:08,510
That hurts.

2243
01:43:12,590 --> 01:43:14,090
That's not fair!

2244
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:15,570
That's not fair!

2245
01:43:16,110 --> 01:43:16,930
Oh!

2246
01:43:23,110 --> 01:43:24,610
His crimes are also mine.

2247
01:43:25,090 --> 01:43:27,650
One of omission and arrogance.

2248
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:28,210
Yeah.

2249
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:31,890
No one should teach the skills I taught him without a clear conscience.

2250
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:34,730
This is the only way I can defuse my own sins.

2251
01:43:35,090 --> 01:43:35,290
Mmm.

2252
01:43:35,790 --> 01:43:36,490
I get you, Pete.

2253
01:43:36,950 --> 01:43:38,070
That one's all yours.

2254
01:43:38,430 --> 01:43:39,470
You got it, Ryden?

2255
01:43:39,610 --> 01:43:39,990
Yep.

2256
01:43:40,030 --> 01:43:40,370
I understand.

2257
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:44,190
Pete, I've taken care of guards and struts G and H.

2258
01:43:44,210 --> 01:43:44,650
Okay, good.

2259
01:43:44,670 --> 01:43:45,630
We won't have to deal with Fatman then.

2260
01:43:45,630 --> 01:43:47,750
I wouldn't recommend you go into any of the other struts.

2261
01:43:47,990 --> 01:43:49,010
I owe you one.

2262
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:51,430
I'll get back to freezing the baby bombs then.

2263
01:43:51,570 --> 01:43:52,530
The baby bombs!

2264
01:43:52,530 --> 01:43:54,090
I'm on it.

2265
01:43:54,330 --> 01:43:56,370
I'll have the radio with me if you need to get in touch.

2266
01:43:56,790 --> 01:43:58,650
Just don't ask for peg-legged Peter.

2267
01:43:59,190 --> 01:44:00,170
He's gone for good.

2268
01:44:00,330 --> 01:44:00,690
Stop.

2269
01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:03,450
Why would you... Nobody was gonna say that.

2270
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:09,550
Nobody was going to ask for peg-legged Peter, okay?

2271
01:44:10,830 --> 01:44:11,550
You weirdo.

2272
01:44:13,610 --> 01:44:15,630
The hell does defuse my own sins mean?

2273
01:44:17,270 --> 01:44:18,010
That's a good question.

2274
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:18,390
Oh shit.

2275
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:18,850
Oh my god.

2276
01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:19,210
Oh my god.

2277
01:44:19,230 --> 01:44:19,490
Oh my god.

2278
01:44:19,550 --> 01:44:19,730
Oh my god.

2279
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:27,500
This guy walks away, right?

2280
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:31,400
He walks away, right?

2281
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:32,440
Oh my god.

2282
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:33,480
Can you not?

2283
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:36,660
I think I can take him from here.

2284
01:44:43,150 --> 01:44:44,690
I think the other guy's still asleep too.

2285
01:44:45,550 --> 01:44:46,690
So let's just run for it.

2286
01:44:48,630 --> 01:44:50,150
Super baby bomb-in method.

2287
01:44:52,450 --> 01:44:53,410
Am I on the right floor?

2288
01:44:53,410 --> 01:44:53,450
Is this the floor?

2289
01:44:55,250 --> 01:44:55,730
Yes.

2290
01:44:58,190 --> 01:44:59,150
Okey-dokey!

2291
01:44:59,610 --> 01:45:00,590
We made it!

2292
01:45:01,050 --> 01:45:01,150
Woo!

2293
01:45:04,450 --> 01:45:05,650
Oh, a gate.

2294
01:45:05,810 --> 01:45:06,630
Yeah, that's so funny!

2295
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:15,860
It's so funny that there's a gate here.

2296
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:18,640
Almost.

2297
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:20,900
There we go.

2298
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:23,160
How much?

2299
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:23,600
OK.

2300
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:25,440
I was going to say, how many bullets do I have?

2301
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,480
I think I'm pretty good.

2302
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:30,180
I keep stealing from these guys.

2303
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:35,580
It would be funny if you kept stealing from guys that they would have no bullets left, you know?

2304
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:38,640
I wish that was... You know, they think of everything in this game.

2305
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:42,420
Why is me stealing their bullets not doing anything either?

2306
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:44,520
They're pretty good.

2307
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:47,780
Say it again.

2308
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:54,990
They go get more?

2309
01:45:56,910 --> 01:46:00,950
I'm going to blow... Oh my gosh, I forgot this part is like so close to the guy.

2310
01:46:03,150 --> 01:46:04,530
Good thing he's blind.

2311
01:46:09,650 --> 01:46:10,610
Nothing here.

2312
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:12,470
Yup.

2313
01:46:12,470 --> 01:46:13,390
Nothing here.

2314
01:46:14,170 --> 01:46:15,270
I came from this way, right?

2315
01:46:18,670 --> 01:46:20,350
Why do the terrorists have tranks anyway?

2316
01:46:20,550 --> 01:46:21,590
That's also a good question.

2317
01:46:25,130 --> 01:46:26,090
Nothing here.

2318
01:46:28,430 --> 01:46:30,270
It's just this guy up here, isn't it?

2319
01:46:32,050 --> 01:46:32,810
What does he do?

2320
01:46:34,790 --> 01:46:36,490
You're not going to pee on me, are you?

2321
01:46:37,890 --> 01:46:40,730
I sure hope there's no one around here that will pee on me.

2322
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:43,890
I'm not asking to get peed on right now, OK?

2323
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,880
Did I... Are the ones that I got before still gone?

2324
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:02,480
I wish I could get this guy.

2325
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:05,460
Oh my God, I can't see where his aim...

2326
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:08,920
Can you walk away?

2327
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:15,260
Is he going to look back?

2328
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:18,660
Okay.

2329
01:47:19,060 --> 01:47:20,300
Alright, I'm going to go next time.

2330
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:21,020
I'm going to go next time.

2331
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:26,580
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine...

2332
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:26,820
Oh!

2333
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:33,120
I love when they yawn.

2334
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:33,920
They're so cute.

2335
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:36,240
Look at him go, his little dot.

2336
01:47:36,340 --> 01:47:37,540
His little dot self.

2337
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:39,380
Walking away.

2338
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:40,900
I love it.

2339
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:43,220
Alright, let's...

2340
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:49,240
Nice!

2341
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:50,500
Thanks for the gift!

2342
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:58,360
Alright guys, let's save real quick because we're about to enter a hell that I do not want to enter.

2343
01:47:58,360 --> 01:47:59,120
I wish to endure.

2344
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:00,140
What can I do for you, Jack?

2345
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:03,580
Rose, please get me out of this damn place!

2346
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:04,840
I hate this one!

2347
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:06,040
I hate this place!

2348
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:07,440
I hate this place!

2349
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:08,660
I hate it!

2350
01:48:08,660 --> 01:48:09,440
I hate it!

2351
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:10,480
I hate this hell!

2352
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,840
Get me out of this hell, please!

2353
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:15,020
Rose...

2354
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:18,040
I can't believe it.

2355
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:20,920
Stillman's prosthetic leg was all a big lie.

2356
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:22,060
I know, what a crazy...

2357
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:22,880
Don't be too hard on him, Rose.

2358
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:26,900
But he's got no right to go around pretending he's got a prosthetic leg.

2359
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:27,240
That hurts.

2360
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:29,960
That's an insult to people who really can't walk.

2361
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:30,500
That hurts.

2362
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:31,840
Everyone's got their own reasons.

2363
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:35,200
Sometimes you've got no choice but to lie.

2364
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:36,820
Are you speaking from experience, Raiden?

2365
01:48:36,980 --> 01:48:39,400
I guess it is necessary sometimes.

2366
01:48:40,340 --> 01:48:40,880
Rose?

2367
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:41,860
Rose?

2368
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:42,380
It's nothing.

2369
01:48:42,660 --> 01:48:43,840
Well, see ya.

2370
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:48,300
What's up with this guy?

2371
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:49,400
He's so aggressive.

2372
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:52,580
What's up with this guy?

2373
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:56,900
It appears that Fat Man placed bombs within each of the struts.

2374
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:57,260
Yeah.

2375
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:59,940
Sorry, I keep calling because I don't want to miss anything, you know.

2376
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:02,940
Don't want to close my eyes.

2377
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:08,420
Don't want to miss a codec call that's fun.

2378
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,240
I want to get all the information.

2379
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:16,480
There's a huge load of C4s at the bottom of Strut H that won't show up on the radar.

2380
01:49:16,780 --> 01:49:17,900
The old man's right.

2381
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:20,600
There's got to be the same thing in Shell 1.

2382
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:20,980
Yeah.

2383
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:21,860
Watch your back.

2384
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:22,720
I'm watching.

2385
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:24,700
What else you got to say, Plissken?

2386
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:28,100
I just got a call from Pete.

2387
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:29,540
He made it to Shell 2.

2388
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:30,320
Wow.

2389
01:49:30,380 --> 01:49:30,840
Really?

2390
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:32,960
Plissken.

2391
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:34,420
I'll take good care of Pete.

2392
01:49:34,580 --> 01:49:35,260
Don't worry.

2393
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:35,840
Okay.

2394
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:38,780
Someone on staff is a Snake fanboy.

2395
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:39,460
No seriously.

2396
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:41,400
Call Plissken with the M9 equipped, I think.

2397
01:49:49,010 --> 01:49:51,970
That's a Tranquilizer gun with a sound suppressor.

2398
01:49:51,990 --> 01:49:54,390
Hit an enemy with that and it's good night.

2399
01:49:54,610 --> 01:49:55,390
Sleep tight.

2400
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:57,910
The time in which the Tranquilizer takes effect depends on where the sound comes from.

2401
01:49:57,910 --> 01:49:59,130
Why did Raiden nod?

2402
01:49:59,130 --> 01:50:00,270
Where you hit your target.

2403
01:50:00,490 --> 01:50:06,490
If you want to knock somebody out with a single shot, aim carefully for vital spots like the head or heart.

2404
01:50:06,490 --> 01:50:06,770
Good night.

2405
01:50:06,930 --> 01:50:07,790
Sleep tight.

2406
01:50:08,130 --> 01:50:09,510
I think I've seen this modified gun before.

2407
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:10,230
Yeah.

2408
01:50:10,490 --> 01:50:14,150
It looks like the same gun used by Solid Snake two years ago.

2409
01:50:14,550 --> 01:50:19,850
Following that terrorist incident, similar models were made and sold among the fans of his exploits.

2410
01:50:19,850 --> 01:50:20,610
The fans?

2411
01:50:20,710 --> 01:50:21,110
Me.

2412
01:50:21,590 --> 01:50:22,270
That's me.

2413
01:50:22,830 --> 01:50:23,910
I'm one of his fans.

2414
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:26,550
That's an American military M9 modified for Tranquilizer bullets.

2415
01:50:26,550 --> 01:50:34,650
When the Tranquilizer bullets hit a target, the round uses the force of the impact to mix the drug, also producing a gas in the process.

2416
01:50:35,130 --> 01:50:40,190
The pressure of the gas drives a built-in piston that injects the target with a powerful anesthetic.

2417
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:42,890
It's like firing a small hypodermic syringe.

2418
01:50:42,950 --> 01:50:46,350
This M9 is a Tranquilizer gun that knocks out the enemy.

2419
01:50:46,650 --> 01:50:47,850
It doesn't kill them.

2420
01:50:50,930 --> 01:50:52,950
Little fanboys with the M9!

2421
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:58,070
Colonel, what do you have to say about that?

2422
01:51:00,030 --> 01:51:03,930
Raiden, leave the odorless C4 on Strut H to Stillman.

2423
01:51:04,050 --> 01:51:07,490
Your job is to dispose of the C4s left on Shell 1.

2424
01:51:08,010 --> 01:51:09,450
Locate every last one.

2425
01:51:09,730 --> 01:51:09,910
Okay.

2426
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:12,950
I like Raiden's small little nod there.

2427
01:51:13,010 --> 01:51:13,450
He's like...

2428
01:51:14,150 --> 01:51:15,190
It's so cute.

2429
01:51:15,570 --> 01:51:17,590
Wait, I also want to call him with the box.

2430
01:51:17,590 --> 01:51:18,070
Hold on.

2431
01:51:19,310 --> 01:51:20,590
Let's call him in the box.

2432
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:22,230
Hey, Plissken.

2433
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:24,830
Plissken, how do you feel about this box?

2434
01:51:26,730 --> 01:51:30,350
The cardboard box that you have is ideal for fooling your enemies.

2435
01:51:30,370 --> 01:51:30,790
It's true.

2436
01:51:30,930 --> 01:51:33,570
It's a very important tool for infiltration missions.

2437
01:51:33,590 --> 01:51:33,670
Very important.

2438
01:51:33,670 --> 01:51:34,090
Very important.

2439
01:51:34,530 --> 01:51:34,750
Really?

2440
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:35,170
Of course.

2441
01:51:35,370 --> 01:51:39,990
I can't begin to count the number of agents whose lives were saved by a cardboard box.

2442
01:51:40,390 --> 01:51:41,710
You mean everyone's using them?

2443
01:51:41,870 --> 01:51:48,210
Look, I'm not exaggerating when I say the success of your mission hinges on how you use that cardboard box.

2444
01:51:48,210 --> 01:51:48,610
It's true.

2445
01:51:48,790 --> 01:51:49,210
It's true.

2446
01:51:49,910 --> 01:51:53,270
But in the end, a cardboard box is only made of paper.

2447
01:51:53,450 --> 01:51:53,670
Yeah.

2448
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:56,310
Handle it with care or it won't be of much use to you.

2449
01:51:56,310 --> 01:51:56,650
Yeah.

2450
01:51:56,990 --> 01:51:59,770
You know, I've lost a couple thanks to you.

2451
01:51:59,910 --> 01:52:00,130
What?

2452
01:52:00,530 --> 01:52:00,970
Nothing.

2453
01:52:01,270 --> 01:52:01,950
Forget it.

2454
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:04,370
Treat your cardboard box with care.

2455
01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:05,010
Lost a couple what?

2456
01:52:05,250 --> 01:52:07,330
Take care of the box and it'll take care of you.

2457
01:52:07,790 --> 01:52:08,830
Don't think of it as just another box.

2458
01:52:08,830 --> 01:52:09,310
Couple boxes?

2459
01:52:09,590 --> 01:52:10,310
Because of me?

2460
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:11,010
Treat it with love.

2461
01:52:11,210 --> 01:52:12,630
Don't be rough, okay?

2462
01:52:16,870 --> 01:52:22,450
This is how you know what kind of relationship you're going to get into with Plissken.

2463
01:52:23,190 --> 01:52:24,490
He's going to treat you with love.

2464
01:52:24,610 --> 01:52:25,630
He won't be rough with you.

2465
01:52:27,610 --> 01:52:28,750
What a weirdo.

2466
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:29,690
What are you talking about?

2467
01:52:29,990 --> 01:52:31,250
What are you talking about?

2468
01:52:32,070 --> 01:52:33,030
Oh gosh.

2469
01:52:33,170 --> 01:52:34,710
I don't want to go in here, you guys.

2470
01:52:35,070 --> 01:52:36,530
I don't want to go in here.

2471
01:52:38,870 --> 01:52:40,350
I hate this place.

2472
01:52:41,110 --> 01:52:43,950
Oh, I hate this Tekken room.

2473
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:45,030
I hate this place.

2474
01:52:45,210 --> 01:52:50,230
I hate... I hate... I hate Strut F Warehouse.

2475
01:52:50,310 --> 01:52:51,490
I hate it.

2476
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:52,310
I hate it.

2477
01:52:52,450 --> 01:52:53,510
You can do this?

2478
01:52:53,690 --> 01:52:53,950
Okay.

2479
01:53:02,610 --> 01:53:04,110
This place sucks!

2480
01:53:07,470 --> 01:53:09,430
I don't even... I don't remember where the...

2481
01:53:16,370 --> 01:53:17,490
Didn't someone come here?

2482
01:53:24,180 --> 01:53:26,140
I didn't destroy all the radios.

2483
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:27,380
There was one that I didn't get.

2484
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:29,940
I see he's even calling.

2485
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:33,040
I... I don't know.

2486
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:35,840
Actually, I feel like it's probably been long enough that the radios are reset.

2487
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:36,120
Right?

2488
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:38,860
I have to drop down from the second floor.

2489
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:39,200
I know.

2490
01:53:39,940 --> 01:53:40,460
I know.

2491
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:41,660
I know where to go for the bomb.

2492
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:44,000
I just don't remember where the node is.

2493
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:49,780
I hate this place.

2494
01:53:56,970 --> 01:53:57,550
It's over.

2495
01:54:04,190 --> 01:54:04,810
It's over.

2496
01:54:06,850 --> 01:54:08,110
Why'd you kick me?

2497
01:54:11,260 --> 01:54:12,650
I forgot he walked over here.

2498
01:54:12,830 --> 01:54:13,690
I'll be honest.

2499
01:54:14,710 --> 01:54:15,210
I

2500
01:54:21,090 --> 01:54:21,850
hate this room.

2501
01:54:22,130 --> 01:54:23,490
I hate this room.

2502
01:54:23,650 --> 01:54:27,310
I hate this... I... I... I hate this room.

2503
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:34,250
It sucks so much!

2504
01:54:35,150 --> 01:54:36,370
I think that's the guy.

2505
01:54:36,450 --> 01:54:38,050
Maybe he's the only one with a radio.

2506
01:54:38,990 --> 01:54:39,690
I wonder.

2507
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:45,880
Do you like any room?

2508
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:47,680
I don't mind most of them.

2509
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,160
It's really this one that I hate.

2510
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:53,000
Maybe if I just...

2511
01:54:53,580 --> 01:54:55,240
Maybe if I just wait it out.

2512
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:58,980
This is what it's meant anymore.

2513
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:02,320
This room or when she's one microsecond late to the stream.

2514
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:06,380
Or us when she's one microsecond...

2515
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:06,820
Nothing here.

2516
01:55:09,220 --> 01:55:10,540
The status report guide.

2517
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:13,880
If they come to check on the guy and find nothing, they should stop bothering you.

2518
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:15,680
It's on you if it's worth the hassle.

2519
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:16,460
Wait, what do you mean?

2520
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:29,480
Oh, he's shorter than I expected.

2521
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:31,180
Please follow forwards.

2522
01:55:31,380 --> 01:55:31,760
Yes!

2523
01:55:33,080 --> 01:55:33,660
Oh, wait.

2524
01:55:40,970 --> 01:55:43,090
If I use my gun, they'll hear...

2525
01:55:47,890 --> 01:55:48,810
They'll hear it.

2526
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:03,400
You can

2527
01:56:08,990 --> 01:56:11,610
break the radio with M9?

2528
01:56:11,770 --> 01:56:12,030
You can?

2529
01:56:12,870 --> 01:56:14,390
Am I getting one guide right now?

2530
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:15,470
I don't know if I'm getting one.

2531
01:56:15,770 --> 01:56:18,570
Am I getting one guide right now?

2532
01:56:18,630 --> 01:56:19,370
I have no idea.

2533
01:56:25,030 --> 01:56:26,450
I don't think you can.

2534
01:56:27,010 --> 01:56:28,110
I don't think you can.

2535
01:56:29,090 --> 01:56:32,510
Because you can't take out the... you can't take out the... what's it called with them.

2536
01:56:36,170 --> 01:56:37,290
Hide his body where?

2537
01:56:53,010 --> 01:56:53,770
I'm not...

2538
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:57,230
I'm not getting...

2539
01:56:57,790 --> 01:56:58,490
Oh my god.

2540
01:56:58,730 --> 01:56:59,290
Oh my god.

2541
01:56:59,690 --> 01:57:00,330
Who's there?

2542
01:57:00,570 --> 01:57:01,010
Nobody.

2543
01:57:01,010 --> 01:57:01,110
Nobody.

2544
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:04,170
I'm gonna get caught.

2545
01:57:04,330 --> 01:57:05,290
I'm gonna get caught hardcore.

2546
01:57:07,830 --> 01:57:08,470
Where's the nerd?

2547
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:09,650
Just give me the nerd.

2548
01:57:09,850 --> 01:57:10,650
Just give me the nerd.

2549
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:11,730
Just give me the nerd.

2550
01:57:11,890 --> 01:57:12,710
Just give me the nerd.

2551
01:57:13,730 --> 01:57:16,810
How did you

2552
01:57:27,100 --> 01:57:27,860
just respond?

2553
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:28,840
I broke your thing!

2554
01:57:28,980 --> 01:57:29,620
I broke your thing!

2555
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:30,920
Oh, here it is.

2556
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:31,940
There it is.

2557
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:32,360
I got it.

2558
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:35,000
I broke it though!

2559
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:35,820
Why?

2560
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:36,800
How are you still calling?

2561
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:40,140
Okay, now I'm gonna go grab his body.

2562
01:57:41,940 --> 01:57:42,260
Fast.

2563
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:45,280
Grab his body.

2564
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:49,780
And run, run, run, run, run in here.

2565
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:52,320
Oh my god.

2566
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:54,340
Are they gonna come in here?

2567
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:58,920
They didn't, they didn't, they didn't come in.

2568
01:57:59,380 --> 01:57:59,700
Okay.

2569
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:01,220
Okay, okay, okay.

2570
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:02,260
That was so close.

2571
01:58:03,220 --> 01:58:03,760
There we go.

2572
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:06,860
And then I'm gonna hide in the box.

2573
01:58:07,940 --> 01:58:09,620
I'm just gonna box it.

2574
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:10,340
I'm just gonna box it.

2575
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:11,460
I don't know if they'll come in here.

2576
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:12,960
I don't know if I have time before they come in here.

2577
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:16,880
Okay, okay, okay.

2578
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:26,940
I got another box.

2579
01:58:29,060 --> 01:58:30,020
Did they leave?

2580
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:31,240
That's it?

2581
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:33,400
Oh, they did not leave.

2582
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:36,020
They're leaving now?

2583
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:37,660
There they go!

2584
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:44,950
Yippee!

2585
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:45,510
Oh wait.

2586
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:47,730
Did they just replace him with somebody else?

2587
01:58:49,070 --> 01:58:50,510
But this guy doesn't come in here, right?

2588
01:58:53,780 --> 01:58:55,440
But I still have to get up there.

2589
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:03,220
Or is that the guy...

2590
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:04,680
Is that the guy on the second floor?

2591
01:59:04,860 --> 01:59:05,420
I can't remember.

2592
01:59:05,620 --> 01:59:06,020
You know what?

2593
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:06,260
It's fine.

2594
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:08,180
No...

2595
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:10,140
I think that's the guy...

2596
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:11,500
I can't tell actually.

2597
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:11,980
Nothing here.

2598
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:13,140
Nothing here.

2599
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:14,460
It looks like they replaced him.

2600
01:59:17,320 --> 01:59:17,720
Ooh.

2601
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:18,840
That...

2602
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:19,800
I mean...

2603
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:21,480
Where's the...

2604
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:23,260
Oh yes, here.

2605
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:24,120
Right?

2606
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:35,460
Don't forget the vent.

2607
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:36,480
Yeah, I remembered it.

2608
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:39,020
Your little secret tunnel.

2609
01:59:39,140 --> 01:59:40,400
But also you can see it on the...

2610
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:44,460
You can see it pretty easily on the...

2611
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:46,360
Is this the...

2612
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:46,800
Which...

2613
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:47,420
When is this?

2614
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:50,100
Oh!

2615
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:54,400
Big...

2616
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:55,260
Big...

2617
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:55,980
Big...

2618
01:59:55,980 --> 01:59:56,660
Big news!

2619
01:59:57,980 --> 01:59:59,040
Oh shit!

2620
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:00,820
Oh shoot!

2621
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:03,100
Wait, now if I take out their...

2622
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:06,360
If I take out their bull...

2623
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:07,680
Or their radios, will they notice?

2624
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:10,000
If I shoot their behinds?

2625
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:11,200
Oh my god.

2626
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:11,700
Big...

2627
02:00:11,700 --> 02:00:12,100
Big...

2628
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:13,140
Big news!

2629
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:14,020
Big news!

2630
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:20,260
Where's the...

2631
02:00:22,860 --> 02:00:23,960
Is it under here?

2632
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:27,280
Oh.

2633
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:28,480
Yes!

2634
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:30,660
Big news!

2635
02:00:36,690 --> 02:00:38,870
Will they notice if I...

2636
02:00:39,630 --> 02:00:41,590
If I shoot their little behinds?

2637
02:00:41,630 --> 02:00:43,370
HQ will still notice...

2638
02:00:43,370 --> 02:00:43,990
No they won't!

2639
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:46,470
That's the point of shooting the...

2640
02:00:47,830 --> 02:00:49,210
The radio, isn't it?

2641
02:00:50,870 --> 02:00:52,390
Isn't that the point of shooting the radio?

2642
02:01:01,150 --> 02:01:03,410
I think this guy is right here.

2643
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:16,380
Lethal mode activated.

2644
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:19,000
I'm waiting for him to walk away.

2645
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:22,880
Nothing here.

2646
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:25,780
Oh!

2647
02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:32,200
This is a dead end!

2648
02:01:32,940 --> 02:01:33,420
Oh...

2649
02:01:34,780 --> 02:01:35,540
Oh my god.

2650
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:36,900
Where the hell am I?

2651
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:40,500
I need to get upstairs.

2652
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:47,240
Nothing here.

2653
02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:52,550
How do I get upst... Okay, hold on.

2654
02:01:54,810 --> 02:01:56,170
I hate this room!

2655
02:02:00,350 --> 02:02:01,530
Formulating game plan.

2656
02:02:02,830 --> 02:02:03,930
Is that guy upstairs?

2657
02:02:04,230 --> 02:02:04,410
Oh.

2658
02:02:04,750 --> 02:02:05,910
Okay, there's... Okay.

2659
02:02:07,530 --> 02:02:08,590
Now there's a guy down here.

2660
02:02:10,270 --> 02:02:10,630
Okay.

2661
02:02:10,630 --> 02:02:11,510
That's why I'm so...

2662
02:02:11,510 --> 02:02:11,670
Okay.

2663
02:02:12,530 --> 02:02:12,890
Sorry.

2664
02:02:13,090 --> 02:02:14,890
I was like, that's why I'm confused.

2665
02:02:15,170 --> 02:02:16,490
Because there's a guy.

2666
02:02:17,710 --> 02:02:18,410
Right there.

2667
02:02:19,570 --> 02:02:21,930
I forget that the upstairs also has...

2668
02:02:29,750 --> 02:02:30,990
I can't go in here, can I?

2669
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:34,550
Upstairs has like a little hallway as well, you know what I mean?

2670
02:02:40,310 --> 02:02:41,470
Where is this guy anyway?

2671
02:02:41,610 --> 02:02:42,830
Oh no, now there's two of them!

2672
02:02:43,030 --> 02:02:43,630
Wait, no.

2673
02:02:43,750 --> 02:02:44,670
I think he's still upstairs.

2674
02:02:45,290 --> 02:02:46,970
There's so many guys in this room!

2675
02:02:47,810 --> 02:02:47,970
There's so many guys in this room!

2676
02:02:49,650 --> 02:02:51,450
The guy would spot you with a broken radio.

2677
02:02:51,590 --> 02:02:53,370
Then you run away and you get a caution instead of an alert.

2678
02:02:53,770 --> 02:02:54,930
I did know that.

2679
02:02:56,250 --> 02:02:56,650
It's...

2680
02:02:56,650 --> 02:02:57,610
It's the...

2681
02:02:58,870 --> 02:03:02,890
If they're out and their radios are broken, then nobody ever comes.

2682
02:03:02,970 --> 02:03:04,490
Is what I'm trying to...

2683
02:03:05,630 --> 02:03:06,030
say.

2684
02:03:06,750 --> 02:03:07,690
Where is this guy?

2685
02:03:08,710 --> 02:03:09,290
Where is this guy?

2686
02:03:13,750 --> 02:03:14,250
Beep beep!

2687
02:03:15,690 --> 02:03:16,130
Beep beep!

2688
02:03:16,130 --> 02:03:17,010
Are you coming downstairs?

2689
02:03:33,190 --> 02:03:33,930
Oh my goodness.

2690
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:40,040
Just a box!

2691
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:41,480
Just a box!

2692
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:43,740
Oh my god, I'm in his way.

2693
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:44,440
Oh no!

2694
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:46,500
Why are you walking against the wall?

2695
02:03:48,940 --> 02:03:50,660
Why are you walking against the wall?

2696
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:52,300
Why are you... Why are you walking against the wall?

2697
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:53,100
Why are you walking against the wall?

2698
02:03:53,260 --> 02:03:54,860
Why are you walking against the wall?

2699
02:03:56,260 --> 02:03:56,660
No!

2700
02:03:59,240 --> 02:03:59,640
Run!

2701
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:00,500
Oh my god.

2702
02:04:00,580 --> 02:04:01,220
Run, run, run!

2703
02:04:07,890 --> 02:04:08,510
Damn it!

2704
02:04:08,930 --> 02:04:09,330
What?

2705
02:04:15,980 --> 02:04:16,780
We made it!

2706
02:04:16,840 --> 02:04:17,340
We made it!

2707
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:18,360
We made it!

2708
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:19,300
We made it!

2709
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:24,400
Oh my gosh.

2710
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:24,800
No alert.

2711
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:25,500
We made it, baby.

2712
02:04:27,340 --> 02:04:27,740
Okay.

2713
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:31,960
Um...

2714
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:34,400
Ugh.

2715
02:04:34,540 --> 02:04:40,500
I just need to get over to that one area and drop down and defuse the bomb and we'll be good... ish.

2716
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:41,500
And then I have to leave.

2717
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:44,740
Oh...

2718
02:04:48,130 --> 02:04:48,530
God.

2719
02:05:00,690 --> 02:05:03,970
But I have my handy dandy... everything.

2720
02:05:04,190 --> 02:05:04,350
Oh.

2721
02:05:06,190 --> 02:05:07,510
I have my handy dandy.

2722
02:05:10,090 --> 02:05:11,310
Okay, this guy comes down.

2723
02:05:11,450 --> 02:05:11,690
Right?

2724
02:05:11,690 --> 02:05:12,430
Who's coming?

2725
02:05:12,790 --> 02:05:14,110
Someone's gonna come over here.

2726
02:05:14,530 --> 02:05:15,010
Maybe not.

2727
02:05:15,130 --> 02:05:15,530
Just kidding.

2728
02:05:20,290 --> 02:05:21,070
Who's coming over?

2729
02:05:21,190 --> 02:05:21,310
No?

2730
02:05:21,390 --> 02:05:21,710
Okay.

2731
02:05:22,170 --> 02:05:23,030
Oh, there he is.

2732
02:05:25,630 --> 02:05:26,590
I'm a coward, you guys.

2733
02:05:26,630 --> 02:05:27,010
I'm a coward.

2734
02:05:27,210 --> 02:05:27,710
Here he comes.

2735
02:05:27,770 --> 02:05:28,030
Here he comes.

2736
02:05:28,290 --> 02:05:28,790
Here he comes.

2737
02:05:28,830 --> 02:05:29,070
Here he comes.

2738
02:05:32,270 --> 02:05:32,590
Don't...

2739
02:05:32,590 --> 02:05:36,010
Oh my gosh.

2740
02:05:36,270 --> 02:05:36,870
And then...

2741
02:05:38,250 --> 02:05:38,910
Don't notice him.

2742
02:05:40,630 --> 02:05:41,330
Don't notice him.

2743
02:05:41,410 --> 02:05:41,790
Don't notice him.

2744
02:05:41,790 --> 02:05:41,790
Yes.

2745
02:05:42,010 --> 02:05:42,450
Good, good, good.

2746
02:05:42,590 --> 02:05:42,970
Okay.

2747
02:05:43,290 --> 02:05:44,210
And then...

2748
02:05:45,730 --> 02:05:46,310
Oh, shoot.

2749
02:05:47,550 --> 02:05:48,530
Uh... You know what?

2750
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:49,250
Oh!

2751
02:05:49,330 --> 02:05:50,250
No, I didn't mean to do that.

2752
02:05:50,270 --> 02:05:50,470
Sorry.

2753
02:05:50,610 --> 02:05:52,070
Um... Sorry, friend.

2754
02:05:53,790 --> 02:05:56,970
I'm just gonna go once this guy stops looking.

2755
02:05:57,070 --> 02:05:57,370
There we go.

2756
02:05:57,810 --> 02:05:58,190
FRIEND!

2757
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:02,510
Here.

2758
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:03,770
Here?

2759
02:06:05,090 --> 02:06:05,470
Here?

2760
02:06:05,470 --> 02:06:05,590
Here?

2761
02:06:08,490 --> 02:06:08,970
Here?

2762
02:06:10,190 --> 02:06:10,790
Right then.

2763
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:12,010
Flip.

2764
02:06:14,070 --> 02:06:14,550
Drop.

2765
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:15,030
In.

2766
02:06:15,750 --> 02:06:16,430
There we go.

2767
02:06:17,030 --> 02:06:17,510
Okay.

2768
02:06:19,150 --> 02:06:19,630
Woah!

2769
02:06:19,790 --> 02:06:20,830
Just in time too!

2770
02:06:21,090 --> 02:06:22,290
That guy was right there!

2771
02:06:24,110 --> 02:06:24,950
I don't care!

2772
02:06:25,350 --> 02:06:25,910
I don't care!

2773
02:06:27,490 --> 02:06:29,170
I just gave him a little love bite.

2774
02:06:29,270 --> 02:06:29,650
That's all.

2775
02:06:30,230 --> 02:06:32,470
I have the last C4 frozen.

2776
02:06:32,470 --> 02:06:35,010
There's nothing showing up on the sensor now.

2777
02:06:35,370 --> 02:06:36,330
Good work, Raiden.

2778
02:06:36,370 --> 02:06:36,630
Thank you.

2779
02:06:36,910 --> 02:06:37,690
You were way ahead of me, kid.

2780
02:06:38,050 --> 02:06:39,010
Come on, Plissken.

2781
02:06:39,010 --> 02:06:39,910
Get on my level.

2782
02:06:40,170 --> 02:06:40,590
How's your bomb, Peter?

2783
02:06:40,950 --> 02:06:41,850
It's a bomb, alright.

2784
02:06:42,030 --> 02:06:42,850
It's a bomb!

2785
02:06:43,090 --> 02:06:46,770
You think there's another one in Shell 1?

2786
02:06:47,090 --> 02:06:47,590
For sure.

2787
02:06:48,070 --> 02:06:49,550
Somewhere at the bottom of Strut A.

2788
02:06:50,330 --> 02:06:51,650
Yeah, we left him a souvenir.

2789
02:06:53,330 --> 02:06:55,010
Yeah, just a little bit of a love bite.

2790
02:06:55,210 --> 02:06:56,430
Shell 2 will be well on its way to destruction.

2791
02:06:56,710 --> 02:06:59,010
You mean that Shell 2 will actually sink?

2792
02:06:59,050 --> 02:06:59,310
Oh gosh.

2793
02:06:59,590 --> 02:06:59,990
Not immediately.

2794
02:07:00,350 --> 02:07:02,290
There'll still be five Struts left.

2795
02:07:02,470 --> 02:07:07,430
But if Shell 1 loses a Strut at the same time, it'll be a very different story.

2796
02:07:07,890 --> 02:07:08,370
Oh no!

2797
02:07:08,370 --> 02:07:10,510
The big Shell's structural integrity depends on a very exact balance.

2798
02:07:10,510 --> 02:07:12,070
I think Fatman did nothing wrong.

2799
02:07:12,390 --> 02:07:16,110
If both Shells lose a Strut each, the whole structure will tear itself apart under its own weight.

2800
02:07:16,110 --> 02:07:18,650
I think... you know, people say Solidus did nothing wrong.

2801
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:20,650
I think also Fatman did nothing wrong.

2802
02:07:21,730 --> 02:07:25,850
It makes combined use of a neutron scintillator and a hydrogen bomb detector.

2803
02:07:26,590 --> 02:07:26,970
It makes combined use of a neutron scintillator and a hydrogen bomb detector.

2804
02:07:26,970 --> 02:07:27,870
You brought that stuff with you?

2805
02:07:28,030 --> 02:07:28,490
Of course.

2806
02:07:28,710 --> 02:07:30,850
I made the calibrations while I was in the past.

2807
02:07:30,950 --> 02:07:32,070
I was making nuclear bombs.

2808
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:34,130
I was making hydrogen bombs in the pantry.

2809
02:07:34,770 --> 02:07:35,550
He's cooking.

2810
02:07:36,150 --> 02:07:38,370
But the best I can do is a sound beacon.

2811
02:07:38,490 --> 02:07:39,310
Not the radar.

2812
02:07:39,890 --> 02:07:40,370
Sound?

2813
02:07:40,490 --> 02:07:44,210
The shorter the interval between beacons, the closer the target.

2814
02:07:44,430 --> 02:07:45,130
I get you.

2815
02:07:45,690 --> 02:07:47,590
There's another one in that pantry I was in.

2816
02:07:47,730 --> 02:07:49,190
You can go back and get it.

2817
02:07:49,930 --> 02:07:51,290
It's all yours, Rodney.

2818
02:07:51,450 --> 02:07:54,430
I'm going to study it some more and see if the freezing process will work.

2819
02:07:54,810 --> 02:07:57,170
Don't touch the other one until I say so.

2820
02:07:57,190 --> 02:07:57,510
Okay.

2821
02:07:58,290 --> 02:08:00,750
I'll stand by until you radio in.

2822
02:08:00,750 --> 02:08:01,970
Okay, I'm just going to hide here.

2823
02:08:02,150 --> 02:08:03,290
I'm in like a perfect spot.

2824
02:08:03,410 --> 02:08:04,430
You guys don't even understand.

2825
02:08:08,670 --> 02:08:09,850
Nobody's going to find me here.

2826
02:08:10,090 --> 02:08:11,770
Carry out an investigation immediately.

2827
02:08:12,870 --> 02:08:14,510
I'm just going to... I'm literally...

2828
02:08:15,530 --> 02:08:16,310
I'm box...

2829
02:08:16,310 --> 02:08:18,030
I'm amongst the boxes.

2830
02:08:18,750 --> 02:08:20,010
Nobody can find me here.

2831
02:08:20,290 --> 02:08:21,610
Nobody will find me here.

2832
02:08:21,810 --> 02:08:23,150
Oh my god, look how fast they go.

2833
02:08:25,630 --> 02:08:26,430
Nothing here.

2834
02:08:27,390 --> 02:08:29,390
Unable to locate the AWOL soldier.

2835
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:30,030
Wait, what do you mean?

2836
02:08:32,030 --> 02:08:33,090
Wait, where did he go?

2837
02:08:35,670 --> 02:08:36,470
Wait, what?

2838
02:08:42,610 --> 02:08:43,770
Where did he go?

2839
02:08:45,950 --> 02:08:47,550
I need you to leave, please.

2840
02:08:49,530 --> 02:08:50,790
I need you to like...

2841
02:08:52,830 --> 02:08:53,890
Actually, where do I go?

2842
02:08:53,990 --> 02:08:54,810
Colonel, what do I do?

2843
02:08:57,130 --> 02:09:00,070
Raiden, go pick up the new sensor Stillman told you about.

2844
02:09:00,750 --> 02:09:02,470
The one that can detect odorless C4s.

2845
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:02,830
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2846
02:09:04,130 --> 02:09:05,310
Actually, you know what?

2847
02:09:05,330 --> 02:09:07,310
It's probably good that we did this one last then.

2848
02:09:07,530 --> 02:09:09,290
Because now we're like kind of...

2849
02:09:10,490 --> 02:09:11,590
We're kind of...

2850
02:09:12,430 --> 02:09:13,370
In a good spot.

2851
02:09:13,590 --> 02:09:14,750
We're not too far away.

2852
02:09:14,950 --> 02:09:17,910
Raiden, go pick up that sensor for odorless C4s.

2853
02:09:17,910 --> 02:09:19,290
Okay, okay, okay.

2854
02:09:19,610 --> 02:09:21,150
It should be in that room in Strut C where you found Pete.

2855
02:09:22,310 --> 02:09:25,630
Okay, everybody's telling me to go get the smelly detector.

2856
02:09:26,430 --> 02:09:26,770
Okay, everybody's telling me to go get the smelly detector.

2857
02:09:26,770 --> 02:09:30,230
Raiden, I've raided a sensor that's capable of detecting odorless C4s.

2858
02:09:30,230 --> 02:09:31,370
Okay, I get it.

2859
02:09:31,650 --> 02:09:32,150
I know.

2860
02:09:33,190 --> 02:09:34,410
In the Strut C pantry.

2861
02:09:34,690 --> 02:09:35,270
Fetch it.

2862
02:09:35,470 --> 02:09:35,950
Fetch it.

2863
02:09:38,290 --> 02:09:40,210
I'm just waiting for this guy right here.

2864
02:09:40,370 --> 02:09:42,290
Then I'm gonna make a break for it.

2865
02:09:42,790 --> 02:09:43,270
Okay.

2866
02:09:43,870 --> 02:09:44,810
Get up there.

2867
02:09:45,390 --> 02:09:46,170
Up there.

2868
02:09:46,990 --> 02:09:47,730
Raiden, please.

2869
02:09:48,230 --> 02:09:48,970
Up there.

2870
02:09:49,090 --> 02:09:49,730
Up there.

2871
02:09:49,930 --> 02:09:50,910
Raiden, please.

2872
02:09:51,570 --> 02:09:52,410
Or is it here?

2873
02:09:52,830 --> 02:09:53,770
Actually, I'm not quite sure.

2874
02:09:53,970 --> 02:09:54,310
Oh my god.

2875
02:09:57,290 --> 02:09:58,770
You looked directly at me.

2876
02:10:21,260 --> 02:10:22,020
You looked directly at me.

2877
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:23,760
Okay, we're finally out of...

2878
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:24,960
the F room.

2879
02:10:25,380 --> 02:10:26,220
F U.

2880
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:27,420
F U room.

2881
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:30,180
Where's the guy that's here?

2882
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:32,060
Oh, there he is!

2883
02:10:32,420 --> 02:10:33,760
Wait, not the coolant!

2884
02:10:35,600 --> 02:10:36,160
Oh.

2885
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:40,740
Oh, come on.

2886
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:42,560
Dang

2887
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:48,640
it.

2888
02:10:48,780 --> 02:10:50,520
That was close.

2889
02:11:02,680 --> 02:11:03,140
We'll get him.

2890
02:11:03,220 --> 02:11:04,500
We'll get this guy.

2891
02:11:04,660 --> 02:11:05,580
We'll get this little thing.

2892
02:11:07,460 --> 02:11:07,900
Oh.

2893
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:15,060
They can do that?

2894
02:11:20,040 --> 02:11:21,220
It noticed him!

2895
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:22,780
It noticed him!

2896
02:11:23,320 --> 02:11:23,760
Asleep!

2897
02:11:23,900 --> 02:11:25,040
Oh my gosh, they're coming this way.

2898
02:11:42,730 --> 02:11:43,170
Uhhh.

2899
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:49,160
I should've...

2900
02:11:55,460 --> 02:11:56,740
abandoned the box.

2901
02:11:56,780 --> 02:11:57,280
Abandoned box!

2902
02:11:57,620 --> 02:12:00,160
I didn't know you could do that.

2903
02:12:04,620 --> 02:12:05,380
Abandoned box!

2904
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:06,180
Abandoned box!

2905
02:12:07,860 --> 02:12:08,620
Abandoned box!

2906
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:09,520
Abandoned box!

2907
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:20,540
Do you think they're gone?

2908
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:22,220
Do you think I could go get it again?

2909
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:24,900
Gaming.

2910
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:26,040
That was amazing.

2911
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:31,800
I just unequipped it at the exact correct time.

2912
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:37,200
No, my box is gone!

2913
02:12:38,160 --> 02:12:38,740
No, my box is gone!

2914
02:12:38,740 --> 02:12:38,980
Oh well.

2915
02:12:39,480 --> 02:12:40,720
Treat it with love.

2916
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:43,020
It treated me with love.

2917
02:12:43,660 --> 02:12:45,420
That was... that was true.

2918
02:12:45,860 --> 02:12:46,420
I don't...

2919
02:12:46,420 --> 02:12:48,780
I will never game that hard ever again.

2920
02:12:48,980 --> 02:12:51,760
I think in my whole afterlife.

2921
02:12:52,900 --> 02:12:56,040
I think I will never game harder than I did in that moment.

2922
02:12:56,140 --> 02:12:57,260
Wait, was that the orange box?

2923
02:12:58,040 --> 02:12:58,620
No.

2924
02:12:58,780 --> 02:13:00,120
My orange box.

2925
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:02,220
No.

2926
02:13:02,220 --> 02:13:03,480
The orange.

2927
02:13:07,150 --> 02:13:08,230
The orange.

2928
02:13:17,180 --> 02:13:19,020
It respawns in the parcel room?

2929
02:13:19,220 --> 02:13:19,580
Oh, okay.

2930
02:13:19,980 --> 02:13:20,680
Does it?

2931
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:21,200
I hope so.

2932
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:23,800
I mean, there's lots of boxes in there.

2933
02:13:26,060 --> 02:13:30,660
Gosh, all these guys having all their stupid radios.

2934
02:13:30,660 --> 02:13:33,000
Doing all their stupid talking.

2935
02:13:34,360 --> 02:13:35,420
Stop talking!

2936
02:13:39,860 --> 02:13:40,460
Just...

2937
02:13:40,460 --> 02:13:40,780
Everybody!

2938
02:13:41,120 --> 02:13:42,280
Everybody shut up!

2939
02:13:44,900 --> 02:13:46,900
Everybody's always talking so much.

2940
02:13:50,660 --> 02:13:51,800
Soldiers these days.

2941
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:54,980
Everybody's... the guy is so needy.

2942
02:13:54,980 --> 02:13:56,420
He's just always waiting for...

2943
02:13:56,420 --> 02:14:00,160
How are you supposed to... How do you know that one person doesn't call in, you know?

2944
02:14:00,260 --> 02:14:02,140
It's just so needy.

2945
02:14:02,140 --> 02:14:03,100
So needy.

2946
02:14:09,510 --> 02:14:10,110
Okay.

2947
02:14:10,190 --> 02:14:11,590
Why are they so competent?

2948
02:14:11,970 --> 02:14:12,570
SMH.

2949
02:14:14,570 --> 02:14:15,550
That's what I'm saying.

2950
02:14:15,770 --> 02:14:15,850
That's what I'm saying.

2951
02:14:16,330 --> 02:14:19,030
Wait, why am I not...

2952
02:14:19,030 --> 02:14:19,530
Oh.

2953
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:30,100
La la la la la.

2954
02:14:30,100 --> 02:14:30,980
La la la la la.

2955
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:36,380
Ah, HQ needy.

2956
02:14:38,120 --> 02:14:38,520
Oh,

2957
02:14:45,450 --> 02:14:45,870
come on!

2958
02:14:54,350 --> 02:14:57,630
But it was... Was it this thing that noticed the guy over there?

2959
02:14:57,750 --> 02:15:00,790
Like, I thought I saw a little tiny exclamation point come up.

2960
02:15:02,370 --> 02:15:04,050
Or am I... Am I...

2961
02:15:04,050 --> 02:15:04,950
crazy?

2962
02:15:06,350 --> 02:15:07,290
Oh, there it is.

2963
02:15:08,150 --> 02:15:12,250
Oh my god, please.

2964
02:15:12,730 --> 02:15:14,830
I can't hit these things ever.

2965
02:15:15,030 --> 02:15:16,130
Oh my god, please.

2966
02:15:17,950 --> 02:15:18,570
Please!

2967
02:15:24,710 --> 02:15:26,240
Is there a guy here?

2968
02:15:26,660 --> 02:15:27,580
Name Doko.

2969
02:15:29,300 --> 02:15:30,460
I'm going loco.

2970
02:15:31,980 --> 02:15:32,980
First try.

2971
02:15:32,980 --> 02:15:35,180
Oh, I forgot there's no one under you.

2972
02:15:40,070 --> 02:15:40,990
First try.

2973
02:15:55,030 --> 02:15:57,170
How this guy comes in, you know?

2974
02:15:58,890 --> 02:15:59,750
Don't mind me.

2975
02:15:59,810 --> 02:16:00,590
I'm peekaboo.

2976
02:16:00,710 --> 02:16:01,790
I'm doing a little peekaboo.

2977
02:16:03,310 --> 02:16:05,350
I'm paying tribute to my country.

2978
02:16:08,690 --> 02:16:09,530
Where is he?

2979
02:16:19,470 --> 02:16:20,590
Oh, he's not over here.

2980
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:28,700
Is there anybody in here?

2981
02:16:31,700 --> 02:16:32,220
Hello?

2982
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:32,560
Hello?

2983
02:16:34,980 --> 02:16:35,940
Wow, it's huge!

2984
02:16:36,380 --> 02:16:37,800
Wow, it's huge!

2985
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:38,460
Here we go.

2986
02:16:42,760 --> 02:16:44,260
I have sensor B.

2987
02:16:44,480 --> 02:16:45,360
I have sensor B.

2988
02:16:47,220 --> 02:16:47,740
Okay.

2989
02:16:47,940 --> 02:16:49,180
How's your invisible bomb?

2990
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:51,800
I'm looking at it, but I'm keeping my distance.

2991
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:54,140
Yeah, keep your distance.

2992
02:16:54,580 --> 02:16:58,980
I just got to the last strut, but there are a few enemy sentries I have to take care of.

2993
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:00,460
Plissken, you're... Does it look bad, Peter?

2994
02:17:00,620 --> 02:17:02,720
He's probably... Plissken's just a novice, though.

2995
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:03,020
Maybe.

2996
02:17:03,020 --> 02:17:03,220
It's an odd one.

2997
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:03,720
I think.

2998
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:05,420
The detonator hasn't been activated.

2999
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:06,260
What?

3000
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:08,080
But the sensors are live.

3001
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:10,180
Which means... Which means?

3002
02:17:10,520 --> 02:17:11,180
This is Plissken.

3003
02:17:11,360 --> 02:17:13,020
I've located the last C4.

3004
02:17:13,080 --> 02:17:13,780
Oh, he's fast.

3005
02:17:14,060 --> 02:17:14,200
Is that it?

3006
02:17:14,420 --> 02:17:15,600
I'm about to freeze it.

3007
02:17:15,820 --> 02:17:16,380
I don't know.

3008
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:17,280
Wait, Plissken!

3009
02:17:17,420 --> 02:17:17,720
Wait!

3010
02:17:18,600 --> 02:17:19,380
Wait, Plissken!

3011
02:17:22,020 --> 02:17:23,120
That was it!

3012
02:17:23,240 --> 02:17:24,140
What's going on?

3013
02:17:24,140 --> 02:17:25,820
The detonator just woke up.

3014
02:17:25,860 --> 02:17:26,660
It's counting down.

3015
02:17:26,760 --> 02:17:27,300
Oh my god!

3016
02:17:27,680 --> 02:17:31,640
The big ones were rigged to be activated when all the baby C4s went offline.

3017
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:34,920
Righten, the one in shell one should be counting down, too.

3018
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:35,640
Hurry!

3019
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:36,980
What's the remaining time?

3020
02:17:38,480 --> 02:17:39,400
400 seconds.

3021
02:17:39,640 --> 02:17:40,620
400 seconds?

3022
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:43,460
Righten, move!

3023
02:17:43,580 --> 02:17:45,520
Get to the bottom of Strut A now!

3024
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:49,180
400 seconds?

3025
02:17:50,040 --> 02:17:50,520
Yeah!

3026
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:53,340
I'm gonna save real quick.

3027
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:56,060
Jack, you okay?

3028
02:17:56,400 --> 02:17:58,100
Girl, I don't think so.

3029
02:17:58,820 --> 02:18:00,440
Is she gonna talk to me?

3030
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:03,540
400 seconds!

3031
02:18:05,720 --> 02:18:07,000
Baby C4s!

3032
02:18:08,600 --> 02:18:09,880
Baby C4s!

3033
02:18:09,880 --> 02:18:10,480
Baby babies!

3034
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:13,280
Hang in there.

3035
02:18:13,460 --> 02:18:14,000
Thank you.

3036
02:18:14,480 --> 02:18:16,280
Okay, so where am I going?

3037
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:17,780
Strut A?

3038
02:18:18,100 --> 02:18:19,540
Oh, jeez!

3039
02:18:20,980 --> 02:18:21,620
Ah!

3040
02:18:24,430 --> 02:18:25,070
Hahaha!

3041
02:18:29,790 --> 02:18:32,210
Just run for it, Righten!

3042
02:18:32,670 --> 02:18:34,230
Just run for it, Righten!

3043
02:18:34,230 --> 02:18:34,990
Run for it!

3044
02:18:35,650 --> 02:18:36,790
Oh, that's the door.

3045
02:18:37,130 --> 02:18:37,550
Hahaha!

3046
02:18:42,840 --> 02:18:44,540
Run, run, run!

3047
02:18:49,900 --> 02:18:51,580
Run for it, Righten!

3048
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:52,060
Run for it, Righten!

3049
02:18:52,060 --> 02:18:52,460
Run for it, Righten!

3050
02:18:52,960 --> 02:18:56,560
They're dumb.

3051
02:18:56,700 --> 02:18:57,160
They're stupid.

3052
02:18:58,660 --> 02:18:59,300
Bwee.

3053
02:19:01,560 --> 02:19:02,780
Bwee, bwee, bwee.

3054
02:19:02,780 --> 02:19:03,460
Bwee, bwee, bwee.

3055
02:19:07,400 --> 02:19:08,040
Bwee.

3056
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:08,300
Bwee.

3057
02:19:10,040 --> 02:19:10,440
Eh?

3058
02:19:12,140 --> 02:19:12,920
Which way is A?

3059
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:15,080
Oi.

3060
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:18,400
It's where I came from before, right?

3061
02:19:19,860 --> 02:19:20,420
Oh yeah!

3062
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:20,820
That's right!

3063
02:19:20,900 --> 02:19:21,220
It's this room.

3064
02:19:28,480 --> 02:19:29,320
Everybody's still asleep.

3065
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:30,160
It's so good.

3066
02:19:30,340 --> 02:19:30,880
It's nice.

3067
02:19:33,020 --> 02:19:33,840
I was like...

3068
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:35,840
I saw the guy on the radar.

3069
02:19:36,100 --> 02:19:36,700
That's why I was confused.

3070
02:19:39,440 --> 02:19:39,840
Um...

3071
02:19:41,400 --> 02:19:42,200
Bum, bum...

3072
02:19:49,510 --> 02:19:51,730
We don't have time to deal with you guys!

3073
02:19:51,990 --> 02:19:52,530
Come on!

3074
02:19:52,530 --> 02:19:52,910
Come on!

3075
02:19:53,630 --> 02:19:54,710
Pick up the pace!

3076
02:19:55,290 --> 02:19:56,530
We're all going down!

3077
02:19:56,830 --> 02:19:57,590
We're all going down!

3078
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,240
I mean, I don't have time to grab a snack, though.

3079
02:20:06,520 --> 02:20:07,200
I think.

3080
02:20:10,360 --> 02:20:12,140
He actually left me a snack!

3081
02:20:15,640 --> 02:20:16,060
Yay!

3082
02:20:16,060 --> 02:20:16,480
Go!

3083
02:20:16,780 --> 02:20:16,960
Go!

3084
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:17,240
Go!

3085
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:18,180
We don't have time!

3086
02:20:29,260 --> 02:20:30,960
Wait, so where do I need to go?

3087
02:20:31,460 --> 02:20:32,340
To the bottom.

3088
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:33,300
How do I get to the bottom?

3089
02:20:34,280 --> 02:20:35,860
Oh, I go upstairs, right?

3090
02:20:36,060 --> 02:20:37,140
And then...

3091
02:20:38,760 --> 02:20:40,420
I go upstairs to go downstairs.

3092
02:20:43,440 --> 02:20:44,020
I think.

3093
02:20:50,540 --> 02:20:52,600
Is this PS2, PS3, or Master Collection?

3094
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:54,040
This is PS2!

3095
02:20:59,890 --> 02:21:01,930
I think I'm just gonna go for it.

3096
02:21:03,310 --> 02:21:03,950
There we go.

3097
02:21:10,940 --> 02:21:11,420
Hello?

3098
02:21:16,920 --> 02:21:18,120
What is it?

3099
02:21:18,180 --> 02:21:18,640
What is it?

3100
02:21:19,940 --> 02:21:20,420
Her?

3101
02:21:22,320 --> 02:21:22,340
Oh.

3102
02:21:22,760 --> 02:21:23,240
Fatman?

3103
02:21:23,240 --> 02:21:24,300
A proximity trigger.

3104
02:21:25,360 --> 02:21:25,760
Microwave.

3105
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:26,500
Wait, what do you mean by that?

3106
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:27,520
Microwave.

3107
02:21:27,540 --> 02:21:27,940
Hallway?

3108
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:28,360
Microwave?

3109
02:21:28,360 --> 02:21:29,220
The seven-foot range.

3110
02:21:29,380 --> 02:21:29,520
What?

3111
02:21:29,820 --> 02:21:31,320
It's not a technique I taught him.

3112
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:33,820
Neither was that multi-bomb booby trap.

3113
02:21:34,440 --> 02:21:37,700
Looks like he's far surpassed me as far as explosives technique goes.

3114
02:21:38,600 --> 02:21:39,740
As for the rest...

3115
02:21:39,740 --> 02:21:41,400
Pete, get the hell out of there!

3116
02:21:41,500 --> 02:21:42,640
Get the hell out of there!

3117
02:21:43,060 --> 02:21:43,460
What?

3118
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:45,520
Wait, I didn't take that long!

3119
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:48,960
Get away from Strut H as fast as you can.

3120
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:49,800
You told me to go to A!

3121
02:21:50,980 --> 02:21:52,060
Keep your distance.

3122
02:21:52,060 --> 02:21:52,380
No.

3123
02:21:53,060 --> 02:21:55,100
Use the spray from as far away as possible.

3124
02:21:55,180 --> 02:21:55,480
Okay.

3125
02:21:55,700 --> 02:21:55,920
Me?

3126
02:21:56,740 --> 02:21:57,360
You can do it.

3127
02:21:57,860 --> 02:21:58,340
Me?

3128
02:21:58,380 --> 02:21:58,760
I know that.

3129
02:21:59,500 --> 02:22:00,620
I'm not so sure.

3130
02:22:00,700 --> 02:22:01,480
You got this, Raiden.

3131
02:22:01,880 --> 02:22:02,600
Do it.

3132
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:04,200
I know you can.

3133
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:04,580
Pete!

3134
02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:05,580
Pete!

3135
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:12,680
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

3136
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:41,200
I have a feeling we might be fighting someone in there.

3137
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:43,480
We're going all the way back to where we started.

3138
02:22:46,360 --> 02:22:47,280
Is it in here?

3139
02:22:48,240 --> 02:22:48,640
I don't know.

3140
02:22:49,240 --> 02:22:49,640
I

3141
02:22:55,230 --> 02:22:56,250
can't remember where it's at.

3142
02:22:58,750 --> 02:22:59,150
Please.

3143
02:22:59,290 --> 02:23:00,290
A man just died.

3144
02:23:01,710 --> 02:23:02,470
Where was it?

3145
02:23:03,810 --> 02:23:04,210
No.

3146
02:23:08,930 --> 02:23:09,470
Hold on.

3147
02:23:09,650 --> 02:23:09,950
I'm looking.

3148
02:23:10,370 --> 02:23:11,870
Oh, maybe I go through over here?

3149
02:23:15,170 --> 02:23:16,110
Is it over this way?

3150
02:23:21,230 --> 02:23:21,630
Yeah.

3151
02:23:21,670 --> 02:23:22,530
We got tons of time.

3152
02:23:22,810 --> 02:23:23,410
I think we're good.

3153
02:23:24,950 --> 02:23:26,190
And you were laughing.

3154
02:23:26,390 --> 02:23:27,450
Did you hear what he said?

3155
02:23:28,790 --> 02:23:29,630
It wasn't me.

3156
02:23:29,650 --> 02:23:30,210
It was Raiden.

3157
02:23:33,210 --> 02:23:33,810
Is it?

3158
02:23:33,890 --> 02:23:34,890
It's not in the water, right?

3159
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:50,180
There.

3160
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:53,560
Yeah, it was Raiden.

3161
02:23:53,820 --> 02:23:55,480
I don't know how I feel about that.

3162
02:23:59,580 --> 02:24:00,220
Oh, no.

3163
02:24:00,300 --> 02:24:00,740
Oh, no.

3164
02:24:03,360 --> 02:24:04,140
Is it this one?

3165
02:24:13,170 --> 02:24:13,990
200 seconds!

3166
02:24:15,050 --> 02:24:15,290
Yeah!

3167
02:24:16,510 --> 02:24:17,110
Come on.

3168
02:24:17,590 --> 02:24:18,710
Is it in the locker?

3169
02:24:21,350 --> 02:24:21,790
Oh, no.

3170
02:24:21,810 --> 02:24:23,290
That literally turned...

3171
02:24:23,290 --> 02:24:23,750
I was like, no.

3172
02:24:23,870 --> 02:24:24,890
You cannot be even...

3173
02:24:25,330 --> 02:24:27,230
You cannot be any colder.

3174
02:24:29,950 --> 02:24:31,610
I don't remember where...

3175
02:24:31,610 --> 02:24:33,270
You guys, I don't remember where it's at.

3176
02:24:36,810 --> 02:24:38,610
Why can't it be smelly instead?

3177
02:24:39,690 --> 02:24:41,510
I'm gonna check the water.

3178
02:24:42,570 --> 02:24:43,770
I don't think it would...

3179
02:24:43,770 --> 02:24:45,670
How would I use the coolant in the water, though?

3180
02:24:51,640 --> 02:24:52,640
How do I dive?

3181
02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:54,600
Oh.

3182
02:24:54,880 --> 02:24:55,600
Go down.

3183
02:24:57,670 --> 02:24:57,790
Go down.

3184
02:24:57,810 --> 02:24:58,570
Shoot.

3185
02:24:58,630 --> 02:24:59,450
I don't remember how to...

3186
02:24:59,450 --> 02:25:00,410
There we go.

3187
02:25:10,310 --> 02:25:11,110
Oh, I'm so close.

3188
02:25:12,070 --> 02:25:13,010
It's like right here.

3189
02:25:16,670 --> 02:25:17,710
I'm like so close.

3190
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:25,020
Guys, I don't think it's the water.

3191
02:25:33,180 --> 02:25:33,580
Oh.

3192
02:25:34,480 --> 02:25:36,420
Sometimes you have to look in first person view.

3193
02:25:36,900 --> 02:25:37,920
Stillman, can I get a hint?

3194
02:25:38,120 --> 02:25:38,640
Oh, wait.

3195
02:25:52,300 --> 02:25:53,560
Colonel, Stillman is dead.

3196
02:25:53,800 --> 02:25:54,400
I know.

3197
02:25:54,980 --> 02:25:55,660
Pull yourself together.

3198
02:25:55,660 --> 02:25:56,920
She has not played this game before.

3199
02:25:57,120 --> 02:25:57,700
I can't.

3200
02:25:57,740 --> 02:25:58,160
I can't do this alone.

3201
02:25:58,240 --> 02:25:59,460
I can't remember the bomb locations.

3202
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:01,260
I only remembered the one.

3203
02:26:01,260 --> 02:26:01,420
Oh, right.

3204
02:26:01,880 --> 02:26:02,620
Stillman is dead.

3205
02:26:02,620 --> 02:26:03,920
The one that was in the pool room.

3206
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:04,840
There are no more explosive specialists.

3207
02:26:05,140 --> 02:26:06,340
That was the only one I remembered.

3208
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:06,700
You're fine.

3209
02:26:06,700 --> 02:26:07,700
I won't let you die.

3210
02:26:08,140 --> 02:26:08,580
Rose.

3211
02:26:08,980 --> 02:26:09,900
All right, then.

3212
02:26:09,980 --> 02:26:11,260
Is sensor B equipped?

3213
02:26:11,500 --> 02:26:11,760
Yes.

3214
02:26:11,980 --> 02:26:12,180
Yes.

3215
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:14,020
See if it responds or not.

3216
02:26:14,260 --> 02:26:17,920
Jack, no matter what, you have to bring an end to this crisis.

3217
02:26:18,520 --> 02:26:18,960
Okay.

3218
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:20,820
Thanks, Rose.

3219
02:26:22,820 --> 02:26:23,260
Oh.

3220
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:24,100
Oh.

3221
02:26:24,100 --> 02:26:24,120
Oh.

3222
02:26:24,440 --> 02:26:24,880
Oh.

3223
02:26:24,980 --> 02:26:25,400
And down.

3224
02:26:26,480 --> 02:26:27,400
And round.

3225
02:26:28,580 --> 02:26:29,460
And round.

3226
02:26:29,600 --> 02:26:30,920
Guys, I don't remember at all.

3227
02:26:32,220 --> 02:26:33,320
Where the hell is the bomb?

3228
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:34,440
Is that it?

3229
02:26:35,720 --> 02:26:36,200
Wait.

3230
02:26:36,260 --> 02:26:36,680
Is that it?

3231
02:26:36,740 --> 02:26:36,900
No.

3232
02:26:41,740 --> 02:26:42,560
Blind mint?

3233
02:26:44,120 --> 02:26:44,880
Want a hint?

3234
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:45,500
Yeah.

3235
02:26:45,940 --> 02:26:46,420
Maybe.

3236
02:26:46,660 --> 02:26:47,120
Oh, my gosh.

3237
02:26:47,180 --> 02:26:49,360
I'm trapped in this little tiny spot.

3238
02:26:53,910 --> 02:26:54,390
Wait.

3239
02:26:55,750 --> 02:26:56,230
Ah!

3240
02:26:57,880 --> 02:26:58,560
I see it.

3241
02:26:58,560 --> 02:27:00,660
How do I get to there, though?

3242
02:27:14,390 --> 02:27:14,850
Raiden.

3243
02:27:14,950 --> 02:27:15,270
Oh, shoot.

3244
02:27:15,370 --> 02:27:15,710
Raiden.

3245
02:27:15,770 --> 02:27:17,230
We actually only have 60 seconds.

3246
02:27:17,450 --> 02:27:17,850
Raiden.

3247
02:27:17,970 --> 02:27:18,650
Raiden, please.

3248
02:27:18,810 --> 02:27:19,250
Raiden.

3249
02:27:19,410 --> 02:27:19,870
Raiden.

3250
02:27:19,950 --> 02:27:22,030
Oh, it's not time to play fishies anymore.

3251
02:27:22,310 --> 02:27:23,630
Or we'll be swimming with the fishies.

3252
02:27:23,710 --> 02:27:24,430
Come on, Raiden.

3253
02:27:27,230 --> 02:27:27,690
Raiden.

3254
02:27:27,930 --> 02:27:28,390
Raiden.

3255
02:27:33,590 --> 02:27:34,050
Spray!

3256
02:27:36,590 --> 02:27:37,050
Yeah!

3257
02:27:37,810 --> 02:27:38,270
Whoo!

3258
02:27:40,810 --> 02:27:43,290
Colonel, I've neutralized the bomb.

3259
02:27:43,630 --> 02:27:44,910
Good work, Raiden.

3260
02:27:44,910 --> 02:27:44,930
Good job, Raiden.

3261
02:27:44,930 --> 02:27:45,490
Thank you.

3262
02:27:45,710 --> 02:27:47,190
That was a great loss for everyone.

3263
02:27:48,030 --> 02:27:48,910
200 seconds.

3264
02:27:48,910 --> 02:27:49,590
Plenty of time.

3265
02:27:49,850 --> 02:27:51,610
Any damage report on the explosion?

3266
02:27:52,030 --> 02:27:55,710
Seems that the duct for diverting the contaminated seawater was destroyed.

3267
02:27:56,210 --> 02:27:58,730
And the central section of Shell 2 is flooding.

3268
02:27:58,830 --> 02:27:59,210
Oh, my God.

3269
02:27:59,290 --> 02:27:59,450
No.

3270
02:27:59,450 --> 02:28:02,070
The explosions ignited the oil slick on the surface.

3271
02:28:02,170 --> 02:28:02,490
No.

3272
02:28:02,650 --> 02:28:03,470
What about the toxins?

3273
02:28:03,590 --> 02:28:04,010
The toxins.

3274
02:28:04,330 --> 02:28:05,650
The chemicals stayed in containment.

3275
02:28:05,710 --> 02:28:05,970
Oh, good.

3276
02:28:06,030 --> 02:28:06,990
There's no immediate danger.

3277
02:28:07,370 --> 02:28:08,810
Is the big Shell stable?

3278
02:28:09,090 --> 02:28:10,130
Shell 1 was unaffected.

3279
02:28:10,130 --> 02:28:11,430
Every MGS fan would be very proud of you, Mint.

3280
02:28:11,470 --> 02:28:12,170
The price was high.

3281
02:28:12,470 --> 02:28:13,890
But the threat of the bomb is over now.

3282
02:28:13,890 --> 02:28:14,910
I don't know why I couldn't understand.

3283
02:28:14,910 --> 02:28:16,490
I don't remember any of the places for the bombs.

3284
02:28:16,730 --> 02:28:16,830
What's the next objective?

3285
02:28:16,870 --> 02:28:18,170
Rescue the president.

3286
02:28:18,450 --> 02:28:19,890
Get back to the upper level.

3287
02:28:20,130 --> 02:28:20,850
Roger that.

3288
02:28:21,450 --> 02:28:22,270
Roger that.

3289
02:28:22,330 --> 02:28:22,750
Oh, yeah.

3290
02:28:22,790 --> 02:28:23,430
The president.

3291
02:28:24,810 --> 02:28:28,870
I forgot about the president since we were so focused on the bombs.

3292
02:28:31,850 --> 02:28:32,290
Okay.

3293
02:28:32,370 --> 02:28:33,830
I hope I don't get ambushed down here.

3294
02:28:34,010 --> 02:28:35,130
That would be pretty bad.

3295
02:28:41,580 --> 02:28:42,940
What can I do for you, Jack?

3296
02:28:43,160 --> 02:28:43,960
Just saving.

3297
02:28:46,260 --> 02:28:46,920
Pres-a-who.

3298
02:28:47,100 --> 02:28:47,360
Pres-a-who.

3299
02:28:48,500 --> 02:28:48,940
Pres-a-who.

3300
02:28:49,780 --> 02:28:50,760
They could never.

3301
02:28:50,980 --> 02:28:52,600
They could never ambush me down here.

3302
02:28:52,620 --> 02:28:53,400
Yeah, they won't do that.

3303
02:28:53,500 --> 02:28:54,080
They won't do that.

3304
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:56,260
They won't do that.

3305
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:03,500
Hang in there.

3306
02:29:03,900 --> 02:29:04,300
Thanks.

3307
02:29:06,140 --> 02:29:06,860
Rose, please.

3308
02:29:06,940 --> 02:29:07,820
Tell me everything.

3309
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:10,040
Bryden.

3310
02:29:10,120 --> 02:29:11,900
I mean, Plissken, what are you doing?

3311
02:29:12,560 --> 02:29:14,200
I'm so used to just saying, Bryden.

3312
02:29:14,540 --> 02:29:14,940
Bryden.

3313
02:29:16,220 --> 02:29:16,620
Hello?

3314
02:29:24,010 --> 02:29:24,410
Rose?

3315
02:29:25,390 --> 02:29:25,790
Hello?

3316
02:29:25,790 --> 02:29:26,350
Bryden.

3317
02:29:26,350 --> 02:29:26,510
Dang.

3318
02:29:26,730 --> 02:29:29,490
The terrorists have retaliated for our bomb neutralization.

3319
02:29:29,710 --> 02:29:29,830
Wait.

3320
02:29:29,870 --> 02:29:30,150
What do you mean?

3321
02:29:30,330 --> 02:29:30,470
What?

3322
02:29:30,690 --> 02:29:32,290
A hostage has been killed.

3323
02:29:32,750 --> 02:29:33,790
Shot in the head.

3324
02:29:34,090 --> 02:29:37,610
They shot one of them on the roof just to make sure we caught it.

3325
02:29:37,670 --> 02:29:39,890
One of our satellites caught it clear as day.

3326
02:29:40,050 --> 02:29:40,530
Oh, my God.

3327
02:29:40,790 --> 02:29:40,950
Damn.

3328
02:29:41,290 --> 02:29:44,450
They announced they would kill one every hour from now on.

3329
02:29:44,850 --> 02:29:44,870
That's not fair.

3330
02:29:44,870 --> 02:29:44,950
That's not fair.

3331
02:29:45,130 --> 02:29:45,790
What are my orders?

3332
02:29:45,990 --> 02:29:46,770
What should I do?

3333
02:29:46,930 --> 02:29:48,530
Stay with your mission objective.

3334
02:29:49,410 --> 02:29:50,530
Rescue the president.

3335
02:29:50,630 --> 02:29:52,230
Someone got shot and he goes, that hurts.

3336
02:29:52,850 --> 02:29:54,530
President Johnson is your first priority.

3337
02:29:54,730 --> 02:29:55,530
President Johnson.

3338
02:29:55,790 --> 02:29:56,110
My first priority.

3339
02:29:56,150 --> 02:29:56,670
My butt.

3340
02:29:56,930 --> 02:29:58,110
They're all in danger.

3341
02:29:58,250 --> 02:29:58,490
Yeah.

3342
02:29:58,650 --> 02:29:59,610
Jack, be reasonable.

3343
02:29:59,850 --> 02:30:02,530
I know what you're feeling, but you can't save them all.

3344
02:30:02,790 --> 02:30:03,270
No.

3345
02:30:03,610 --> 02:30:04,770
Not by myself.

3346
02:30:05,170 --> 02:30:08,010
Are you expecting that Plissken to come through?

3347
02:30:08,530 --> 02:30:09,010
Well.

3348
02:30:09,310 --> 02:30:11,710
Looks like he's turned his radio off too.

3349
02:30:11,810 --> 02:30:11,830
Jack, be reasonable.

3350
02:30:11,830 --> 02:30:11,850
No.

3351
02:30:12,010 --> 02:30:14,290
I can't complete this mission by myself.

3352
02:30:14,550 --> 02:30:16,890
That man was not included in the simulation.

3353
02:30:17,330 --> 02:30:19,550
He is not a factor in this mission.

3354
02:30:19,750 --> 02:30:21,370
What do you mean by that, Colonel?

3355
02:30:21,410 --> 02:30:21,570
Yeah.

3356
02:30:21,590 --> 02:30:22,490
What do you mean by that, Colonel?

3357
02:30:22,650 --> 02:30:24,130
Your mission must remain a solo effort.

3358
02:30:24,330 --> 02:30:25,370
What about the seals?

3359
02:30:25,790 --> 02:30:26,550
No second attempt.

3360
02:30:26,730 --> 02:30:27,430
What do you mean by that?

3361
02:30:27,810 --> 02:30:28,930
We haven't even gotten to planning that.

3362
02:30:29,150 --> 02:30:30,970
All we can do is wait.

3363
02:30:31,170 --> 02:30:32,530
Who the heck do you think you are?

3364
02:30:32,830 --> 02:30:33,930
In the meantime, you're our only hope.

3365
02:30:34,930 --> 02:30:35,710
I understand.

3366
02:30:36,670 --> 02:30:39,070
Raiden, go and rescue the President.

3367
02:30:39,390 --> 02:30:39,830
What are you talking about?

3368
02:30:39,830 --> 02:30:42,510
You can start off by getting to the upper level of Strut A.

3369
02:30:42,830 --> 02:30:43,110
Yeah.

3370
02:30:43,950 --> 02:30:44,550
Strut A.

3371
02:30:50,020 --> 02:30:51,460
You guys have to go to the bathroom.

3372
02:30:51,640 --> 02:30:53,200
I think this might be a good time to go.

3373
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:55,020
Let's take a potty break real quick.

3374
02:30:56,340 --> 02:30:57,880
Let's do a quick potty break.

3375
02:30:58,140 --> 02:30:58,580
I think this might be a good time to go.

3376
02:30:59,400 --> 02:31:01,980
And then we'll go up.

3377
02:31:02,420 --> 02:31:05,460
I think right here, right before I go into the next room is a good spot.

3378
02:31:06,940 --> 02:31:08,620
I've got to go to the little ghost's room.

3379
02:31:09,560 --> 02:31:10,480
Potty break for everybody.

3380
02:31:11,140 --> 02:31:11,540
Stretch.

3381
02:31:11,700 --> 02:31:12,540
Get some water.

3382
02:31:16,640 --> 02:31:17,900
And go to the bathroom.

3383
02:31:18,060 --> 02:31:20,660
I don't want a pee buff right now.

3384
02:31:20,780 --> 02:31:24,340
I know going to the bathroom will be a debuff for me, but...

3385
02:31:25,220 --> 02:31:27,960
You know, I just gotta do what I gotta do.

3386
02:31:28,320 --> 02:31:29,520
I really gotta go.

3387
02:31:29,880 --> 02:31:30,960
Okay, I'll be right back.

3388
02:34:10,950 --> 02:34:11,670
I'm back.

3389
02:34:12,070 --> 02:34:13,210
Oh my gosh, you guys.

3390
02:34:17,890 --> 02:34:20,690
Matara's out here trying to be like she's some Metal Gear expert.

3391
02:34:21,730 --> 02:34:24,750
Girl, get past literally two games.

3392
02:34:28,350 --> 02:34:29,270
She's on Twitter.

3393
02:34:29,270 --> 02:34:32,170
Someone was just like, there were games before Metal Gear Solid.

3394
02:34:32,490 --> 02:34:35,290
And she's just like, yeah, but they're old and janky.

3395
02:34:35,390 --> 02:34:37,710
I got recommended to do solids if you're really...

3396
02:34:37,710 --> 02:34:40,230
And then if you really love them, dive into Metal Gear 1 and 2.

3397
02:34:40,310 --> 02:34:42,890
I'm like, how dare you say that about Running Man?

3398
02:34:43,370 --> 02:34:44,470
I love that guy.

3399
02:34:44,690 --> 02:34:46,130
He's not old and janky.

3400
02:34:50,530 --> 02:34:52,310
How dare you say that?

3401
02:34:52,470 --> 02:34:53,150
Do you have a good pee?

3402
02:34:53,270 --> 02:34:54,970
Yeah, I saw that tweet and I was like...

3403
02:34:54,970 --> 02:34:55,890
Running Man!

3404
02:34:59,710 --> 02:35:01,030
I love Running Man.

3405
02:35:01,130 --> 02:35:02,510
How could you say that about him?

3406
02:35:06,330 --> 02:35:07,850
She's just like...

3407
02:35:07,850 --> 02:35:10,210
I like how someone's like, this isn't Mint.

3408
02:35:10,330 --> 02:35:11,130
What's going on here?

3409
02:35:15,730 --> 02:35:18,530
Mint has Mata's Twitter details.

3410
02:35:20,290 --> 02:35:23,450
Mata, I feel your girlfriend's tastes are roving off on you.

3411
02:35:23,570 --> 02:35:24,390
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3412
02:35:24,750 --> 02:35:25,770
Let's not...

3413
02:35:25,770 --> 02:35:27,230
Let's not...

3414
02:35:28,190 --> 02:35:29,030
Let's not...

3415
02:35:29,030 --> 02:35:30,970
Let's not jump to any titles now.

3416
02:35:37,050 --> 02:35:40,470
How dare you say that about Running Man?

3417
02:35:40,830 --> 02:35:42,070
Running Man's the best.

3418
02:35:42,650 --> 02:35:43,210
Yeah.

3419
02:35:44,410 --> 02:35:45,710
Girlfriend with a space.

3420
02:35:45,970 --> 02:35:46,210
Oh!

3421
02:35:47,030 --> 02:35:47,930
Yeah, yeah.

3422
02:35:48,090 --> 02:35:49,270
We are girls.

3423
02:35:49,410 --> 02:35:50,150
We are friends.

3424
02:35:50,530 --> 02:35:51,110
Well, kinda.

3425
02:35:51,330 --> 02:35:51,830
That's...

3426
02:35:51,830 --> 02:35:53,730
Even that needs like a little bit of a...

3427
02:35:54,990 --> 02:35:55,830
I don't know.

3428
02:35:55,870 --> 02:35:57,570
Even that needs a bit of a...

3429
02:35:57,570 --> 02:36:00,090
an asterisk, you know?

3430
02:36:00,190 --> 02:36:00,650
Cliff...

3431
02:36:00,650 --> 02:36:02,650
Or a footnote, I believe.

3432
02:36:04,890 --> 02:36:05,450
Anyway.

3433
02:36:06,290 --> 02:36:07,850
Let's get going.

3434
02:36:18,920 --> 02:36:19,960
That's my ride!

3435
02:36:20,440 --> 02:36:20,700
Oh!

3436
02:36:21,140 --> 02:36:21,760
Oh, oh!

3437
02:36:22,020 --> 02:36:22,700
Oh, oh!

3438
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:24,080
Oh, yeah!

3439
02:36:25,900 --> 02:36:26,460
Delivery!

3440
02:36:27,340 --> 02:36:28,320
Oh my gosh.

3441
02:36:28,320 --> 02:36:29,740
We get a hot lady delivery.

3442
02:36:32,160 --> 02:36:33,340
I don't remember.

3443
02:36:33,860 --> 02:36:35,700
I think you just wait this fight out, right?

3444
02:36:35,960 --> 02:36:37,400
I don't remember exactly.

3445
02:36:38,100 --> 02:36:39,440
Look at all them bugs.

3446
02:36:40,880 --> 02:36:41,400
Nice.

3447
02:36:43,260 --> 02:36:47,200
I can't tell you how happy I am that you rely back at all.

3448
02:36:47,420 --> 02:36:49,380
I knew this moment would come.

3449
02:36:49,660 --> 02:36:49,780
Oh!

3450
02:36:52,840 --> 02:36:54,660
Show yourself and finish me.

3451
02:36:54,760 --> 02:36:55,880
Are you obsessed with me or something?

3452
02:36:56,100 --> 02:36:57,640
Like you finished off my father.

3453
02:36:57,920 --> 02:36:58,260
Hey!

3454
02:36:58,340 --> 02:36:58,760
What?

3455
02:36:58,860 --> 02:36:59,320
What?

3456
02:36:59,380 --> 02:36:59,680
Oh!

3457
02:37:01,320 --> 02:37:02,720
Oh, crap.

3458
02:37:03,880 --> 02:37:05,240
Oh, crap.

3459
02:37:05,780 --> 02:37:09,460
Oh, crap.

3460
02:37:09,820 --> 02:37:15,820
It's just Raiden's slightly nasally voice that just makes him sound so nerdy.

3461
02:37:16,020 --> 02:37:16,920
That's not him.

3462
02:37:17,400 --> 02:37:18,460
Oh, crap.

3463
02:37:18,860 --> 02:37:20,740
This could be interesting.

3464
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:23,880
You've seen the fires of hell, haven't you?

3465
02:37:23,980 --> 02:37:24,480
Ugh.

3466
02:37:25,240 --> 02:37:25,960
Oh!

3467
02:37:26,500 --> 02:37:27,220
Hey!

3468
02:37:27,380 --> 02:37:28,140
That's my ride!

3469
02:37:28,460 --> 02:37:29,000
I'm so excited!

3470
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:29,060
Oh, crap.

3471
02:37:29,320 --> 02:37:29,340
Aw, crap.

3472
02:37:29,340 --> 02:37:31,480
Might be you can give me death.

3473
02:37:33,560 --> 02:37:34,800
My name is Fortune.

3474
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:37,080
Lucky in war and nothing else.

3475
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:39,440
Fortune!

3476
02:37:39,560 --> 02:37:41,760
And without a death to call my own.

3477
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:42,920
Hurry!

3478
02:37:43,300 --> 02:37:44,020
Kill me.

3479
02:37:44,080 --> 02:37:44,400
Please!

3480
02:37:44,860 --> 02:37:45,920
She's so awesome.

3481
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:50,280
She's so awesome.

3482
02:37:50,440 --> 02:37:51,360
Oh my gosh!

3483
02:37:51,420 --> 02:37:51,620
Wait.

3484
02:37:52,420 --> 02:37:52,900
Wait.

3485
02:37:53,280 --> 02:37:54,100
Oh my god!

3486
02:37:54,260 --> 02:37:54,580
Aah!

3487
02:37:55,300 --> 02:37:56,540
Te-te-te -te -te.

3488
02:37:56,620 --> 02:37:57,540
Te-te-te-te -te.

3489
02:37:57,540 --> 02:37:58,140
Te-te-te-te -te.

3490
02:37:58,200 --> 02:37:58,900
Te-te-te-te -te.

3491
02:37:58,900 --> 02:37:58,980
Te -te -te-te -te.

3492
02:37:58,980 --> 02:37:59,180
Te-te-te-te -te -te.

3493
02:37:59,180 --> 02:38:01,680
Te-te-te-te This is our first time here in Yandel's Dead Cell!

3494
02:38:04,320 --> 02:38:07,380
Why are you on fire?

3495
02:38:46,040 --> 02:38:47,780
I just have to wait this one out, don't I?

3496
02:38:47,980 --> 02:38:48,520
Oh my God.

3497
02:38:54,590 --> 02:38:55,230
Yeah, yeah.

3498
02:39:04,430 --> 02:39:05,270
Oh my God.

3499
02:39:05,350 --> 02:39:05,790
Oh my God.

3500
02:39:05,850 --> 02:39:06,370
Oh my God.

3501
02:39:06,450 --> 02:39:06,710
Oh my God.

3502
02:39:06,730 --> 02:39:07,510
Oh my God.

3503
02:39:17,500 --> 02:39:18,480
I can't see anything.

3504
02:39:19,340 --> 02:39:20,620
I can't see where she's aiming at.

3505
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:22,660
Oh my God.

3506
02:39:27,350 --> 02:39:29,430
I don't know how long I need to last for.

3507
02:39:30,630 --> 02:39:31,090
Raiden!

3508
02:39:49,260 --> 02:39:49,980
Oh no!

3509
02:39:50,200 --> 02:39:50,880
My box!

3510
02:39:51,820 --> 02:39:52,480
My box!

3511
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:53,700
My box!

3512
02:39:57,160 --> 02:39:58,920
Don't go out of the... Don't get on fire.

3513
02:40:00,220 --> 02:40:01,040
Oh my God, no.

3514
02:40:03,220 --> 02:40:04,300
Oh my God, Raiden!

3515
02:40:04,440 --> 02:40:05,080
Oh God, Raiden!

3516
02:40:06,760 --> 02:40:07,940
Nice save, nice save.

3517
02:40:09,660 --> 02:40:10,960
Yeah, let's call it Kodak.

3518
02:40:15,180 --> 02:40:16,820
I can't hit her!

3519
02:40:20,620 --> 02:40:21,160
Yeah.

3520
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:23,040
Okay.

3521
02:40:23,920 --> 02:40:24,460
Oh.

3522
02:40:24,740 --> 02:40:25,760
No, it came back down!

3523
02:40:28,140 --> 02:40:28,680
Okay.

3524
02:40:30,780 --> 02:40:31,320
Yeah!

3525
02:40:33,620 --> 02:40:34,300
Evade her!

3526
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:36,260
I wish I could lead her to, like...

3527
02:40:36,260 --> 02:40:36,980
Come over here.

3528
02:40:37,320 --> 02:40:37,720
Plissken!

3529
02:40:38,960 --> 02:40:39,240
No!

3530
02:40:46,090 --> 02:40:46,690
Oh my God.

3531
02:40:46,770 --> 02:40:46,930
Oh!

3532
02:40:47,830 --> 02:40:48,950
Am I not on fire?

3533
02:40:50,830 --> 02:40:51,450
Oh my God.

3534
02:40:51,650 --> 02:40:52,230
Oh my God.

3535
02:40:59,940 --> 02:41:00,480
Good boy.

3536
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:04,900
Um, now's not the time, Cardo!

3537
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:06,120
She's right in front of me!

3538
02:41:07,660 --> 02:41:08,060
Um...

3539
02:41:08,060 --> 02:41:09,140
She's right in front of me.

3540
02:41:09,440 --> 02:41:09,840
Isn't she?

3541
02:41:10,080 --> 02:41:10,560
Isn't she?

3542
02:41:11,940 --> 02:41:12,340
Isn't she?

3543
02:41:12,340 --> 02:41:13,400
She's right.

3544
02:41:15,360 --> 02:41:15,880
Peta!

3545
02:41:20,580 --> 02:41:22,220
Oh, seven frames.

3546
02:41:22,380 --> 02:41:23,040
I know, right?

3547
02:41:27,100 --> 02:41:27,620
Okay.

3548
02:41:28,400 --> 02:41:29,160
Oh my God.

3549
02:41:33,480 --> 02:41:34,520
Oh my God.

3550
02:41:34,520 --> 02:41:37,800
I have to go all the way back over there.

3551
02:41:37,880 --> 02:41:38,340
So annoying.

3552
02:41:42,340 --> 02:41:42,820
He didn't say.

3553
02:41:48,240 --> 02:41:49,980
Perfect timing actually.

3554
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:54,340
No bisexual!

3555
02:42:00,870 --> 02:42:02,350
No, keep playing the theme!

3556
02:42:02,850 --> 02:42:04,950
That is not where you ended up, Raiden.

3557
02:42:15,530 --> 02:42:16,310
Oooh.

3558
02:42:21,990 --> 02:42:24,430
Batman did nothing wrong.

3559
02:42:36,130 --> 02:42:37,690
She's so awesome.

3560
02:42:39,970 --> 02:42:40,950
Nah.

3561
02:42:44,400 --> 02:42:45,510
Hey, I'm right here!

3562
02:42:45,530 --> 02:42:45,790
You know.

3563
02:42:46,090 --> 02:42:47,850
I can still hear you.

3564
02:42:48,350 --> 02:42:48,730
Hey!

3565
02:42:50,410 --> 02:42:51,170
Yeah.

3566
02:42:51,410 --> 02:42:52,410
Come on.

3567
02:42:52,470 --> 02:42:53,390
Yes, queen!

3568
02:42:55,210 --> 02:42:55,970
Now!

3569
02:42:57,770 --> 02:42:58,530
Now!

3570
02:43:00,650 --> 02:43:02,290
Nice one, Raiden!

3571
02:43:02,330 --> 02:43:02,970
Nice one!

3572
02:43:05,390 --> 02:43:05,770
Yeah!

3573
02:43:06,350 --> 02:43:06,730
Baby!

3574
02:43:17,300 --> 02:43:17,820
Now!

3575
02:43:19,360 --> 02:43:20,340
Oh crap!

3576
02:43:25,980 --> 02:43:26,940
She's so cool.

3577
02:43:29,080 --> 02:43:32,460
She's like, not even you can kill me after my lover's been killed.

3578
02:43:36,380 --> 02:43:37,820
Raiden is a toad.

3579
02:43:40,220 --> 02:43:41,560
What do you mean by that?

3580
02:43:43,800 --> 02:43:45,240
Fortunately, he got shot in the head.

3581
02:43:45,740 --> 02:43:46,260
No.

3582
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:48,580
That death was meant for me.

3583
02:43:48,580 --> 02:43:49,560
Aww.

3584
02:43:49,980 --> 02:43:53,100
Why am I the only one that can't die?

3585
02:43:56,160 --> 02:43:57,380
Alone again?

3586
02:43:58,160 --> 02:43:59,800
Cheated out of death again?

3587
02:44:02,180 --> 02:44:04,780
How long will you force me to live?

3588
02:44:06,540 --> 02:44:08,440
How much longer, dad?

3589
02:44:12,850 --> 02:44:14,410
You've punished me enough.

3590
02:44:22,040 --> 02:44:23,600
Just, just walk.

3591
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:24,320
Just...

3592
02:44:24,320 --> 02:44:25,540
Shut up.

3593
02:44:25,580 --> 02:44:25,620
I'm not dead.

3594
02:44:25,620 --> 02:44:25,660
I'm not dead.

3595
02:44:26,740 --> 02:44:27,000
Oh!

3596
02:44:27,980 --> 02:44:29,040
Raiden, come on.

3597
02:44:29,240 --> 02:44:30,120
Read the room.

3598
02:44:31,080 --> 02:44:32,220
Raiden, read the room!

3599
02:44:32,560 --> 02:44:33,400
Come on, man.

3600
02:44:33,700 --> 02:44:35,740
Just like you'll ever, just...

3601
02:44:35,740 --> 02:44:37,780
But you couldn't kill me either.

3602
02:44:38,520 --> 02:44:39,000
No.

3603
02:44:40,700 --> 02:44:42,120
Just, just get out of here.

3604
02:44:42,180 --> 02:44:42,320
Yeah.

3605
02:44:42,360 --> 02:44:42,760
Just go.

3606
02:44:43,540 --> 02:44:44,460
Just come on.

3607
02:44:44,500 --> 02:44:44,940
There we go.

3608
02:44:46,760 --> 02:44:47,900
I can't read the air.

3609
02:44:51,720 --> 02:44:53,000
I can't read the air.

3610
02:44:57,930 --> 02:44:58,410
I can't read the air.

3611
02:44:58,430 --> 02:44:59,550
We are back!

3612
02:45:03,550 --> 02:45:07,550
Alrighty, we got to get all the way over there in 400 seconds, baby!

3613
02:45:19,790 --> 02:45:20,810
He's still alive!

3614
02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:35,260
You know that meme that's just like killing postponed?

3615
02:45:37,060 --> 02:45:37,900
That's him.

3616
02:45:38,600 --> 02:45:39,720
How is he alive?

3617
02:45:40,460 --> 02:45:41,320
Come on, Vamp!

3618
02:45:41,780 --> 02:45:42,740
How is he alive?

3619
02:45:49,240 --> 02:45:50,440
400 seconds.

3620
02:45:52,440 --> 02:45:53,760
To the heliport.

3621
02:45:56,220 --> 02:45:58,120
Raiden has terrible luck with women.

3622
02:45:58,300 --> 02:45:58,680
It's true.

3623
02:46:01,380 --> 02:46:01,980
Okay.

3624
02:46:03,660 --> 02:46:04,260
Colonel!

3625
02:46:04,260 --> 02:46:05,280
Where's the heliport?

3626
02:46:07,060 --> 02:46:08,700
The clock is ticking, Raiden.

3627
02:46:08,820 --> 02:46:11,420
Get to the heliport on the roof of Strut E.

3628
02:46:11,560 --> 02:46:12,360
Strut E!

3629
02:46:12,660 --> 02:46:14,360
Is that the one that had the stinky plane?

3630
02:46:18,360 --> 02:46:18,800
Bomb!

3631
02:46:21,460 --> 02:46:23,260
Wait, why can't I go over to that one?

3632
02:46:23,800 --> 02:46:24,240
Hello?

3633
02:46:24,760 --> 02:46:25,360
There we go.

3634
02:46:25,780 --> 02:46:26,440
There it is!

3635
02:46:26,540 --> 02:46:26,780
Bomb!

3636
02:46:28,140 --> 02:46:28,580
Okay.

3637
02:46:29,620 --> 02:46:31,420
We just got to go through the hell...

3638
02:46:32,220 --> 02:46:33,860
Through hell F.

3639
02:46:37,860 --> 02:46:39,060
Just got to go through F.

3640
02:46:40,140 --> 02:46:41,360
We just got to go through F.

3641
02:46:41,480 --> 02:46:42,260
Just got to go through F.

3642
02:46:42,440 --> 02:46:44,540
I just got to run for it.

3643
02:46:44,600 --> 02:46:45,740
Just got to run for it.

3644
02:46:46,140 --> 02:46:47,180
B for bomb.

3645
02:46:59,880 --> 02:47:00,280
Rude!

3646
02:47:01,180 --> 02:47:01,820
Fat man!

3647
02:47:08,070 --> 02:47:08,830
Fat man!

3648
02:47:14,240 --> 02:47:14,840
Oh god.

3649
02:47:16,900 --> 02:47:18,440
I know I don't have that much time.

3650
02:47:19,420 --> 02:47:21,360
But maybe I can find a snack.

3651
02:47:22,320 --> 02:47:22,720
No...

3652
02:47:26,520 --> 02:47:30,360
It's like the guards left and everyone is like, yeah, this will take care of it.

3653
02:47:42,540 --> 02:47:43,100
Oh wait.

3654
02:47:43,700 --> 02:47:44,920
I should be on the other side.

3655
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:45,420
Hold on.

3656
02:47:45,840 --> 02:47:46,900
Let's go to the other side.

3657
02:47:48,220 --> 02:47:50,040
We call them fluffy people now.

3658
02:48:09,070 --> 02:48:09,470
Okay.

3659
02:48:13,880 --> 02:48:14,680
Did you already...

3660
02:48:14,680 --> 02:48:14,760
Oh.

3661
02:48:15,660 --> 02:48:16,600
I saw that.

3662
02:48:16,680 --> 02:48:17,920
Did you already defeat Batman?

3663
02:48:17,920 --> 02:48:19,940
On my way to do so.

3664
02:48:20,280 --> 02:48:21,360
On my way.

3665
02:48:23,260 --> 02:48:23,900
Wait a second.

3666
02:48:24,780 --> 02:48:25,220
Whoa.

3667
02:48:25,280 --> 02:48:25,400
Whoa.

3668
02:48:25,460 --> 02:48:25,720
Wait.

3669
02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:26,700
This is new.

3670
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:28,120
Wait.

3671
02:48:28,200 --> 02:48:29,300
You're not supposed to be here.

3672
02:48:30,060 --> 02:48:31,760
Why are there more guys here now?

3673
02:48:32,940 --> 02:48:33,380
Wait.

3674
02:48:35,020 --> 02:48:36,020
What the hell?

3675
02:48:36,840 --> 02:48:37,280
Wait.

3676
02:48:37,500 --> 02:48:38,900
Why are there more guys here now?

3677
02:48:42,230 --> 02:48:43,330
You're not supposed to be here.

3678
02:49:07,740 --> 02:49:08,400
Oh shoot.

3679
02:49:12,040 --> 02:49:12,480
What?

3680
02:49:12,480 --> 02:49:12,520
What?

3681
02:49:12,800 --> 02:49:13,400
There we go.

3682
02:49:13,600 --> 02:49:14,040
Okay.

3683
02:49:14,800 --> 02:49:15,560
Crisis averted.

3684
02:49:16,580 --> 02:49:17,020
Anyway.

3685
02:49:17,360 --> 02:49:17,820
Let's go.

3686
02:49:21,980 --> 02:49:22,740
Let's go.

3687
02:49:23,740 --> 02:49:25,040
That was a close one, wasn't it?

3688
02:49:34,540 --> 02:49:35,620
Anyone else here?

3689
02:49:37,140 --> 02:49:38,020
Nothing here.

3690
02:49:39,200 --> 02:49:41,260
I think I should go from up top.

3691
02:49:41,480 --> 02:49:42,180
I'm not going to lie.

3692
02:49:43,160 --> 02:49:44,780
I think I should go from up top.

3693
02:49:46,820 --> 02:49:47,240
Nice.

3694
02:49:55,980 --> 02:49:57,000
Nothing here.

3695
02:49:58,500 --> 02:49:59,960
I'm just going to take them out and go.

3696
02:50:02,380 --> 02:50:03,060
No,

3697
02:50:32,390 --> 02:50:32,610
don't.

3698
02:50:33,250 --> 02:50:33,930
There.

3699
02:50:34,030 --> 02:50:34,890
Oh shoot.

3700
02:50:46,560 --> 02:50:47,240
Clean.

3701
02:50:52,200 --> 02:50:53,460
A little...

3702
02:50:53,460 --> 02:50:53,960
A little...

3703
02:50:53,960 --> 02:50:54,640
A little...

3704
02:50:54,640 --> 02:50:55,720
A little struggle.

3705
02:50:58,480 --> 02:51:00,140
Almost triggered the endless guard.

3706
02:51:00,300 --> 02:51:00,600
I know.

3707
02:51:04,140 --> 02:51:04,760
I don't...

3708
02:51:04,760 --> 02:51:05,620
Oh, he is up there.

3709
02:51:05,680 --> 02:51:07,240
I was going to say, I don't see the guy up there.

3710
02:51:09,040 --> 02:51:09,480
Hey!

3711
02:51:09,720 --> 02:51:10,880
That's where Fat Man is.

3712
02:51:15,740 --> 02:51:16,600
That's his spot.

3713
02:51:17,860 --> 02:51:19,300
Why are you up there with him?

3714
02:51:36,680 --> 02:51:39,200
I'm just grabbing them real quick so I don't forget.

3715
02:51:41,480 --> 02:51:42,560
About them later.

3716
02:51:43,320 --> 02:51:43,760
Boom.

3717
02:51:43,880 --> 02:51:44,160
Boom.

3718
02:51:44,440 --> 02:51:44,660
Boom.

3719
02:51:44,660 --> 02:51:45,020
Boom.

3720
02:51:45,020 --> 02:51:45,340
Boom.

3721
02:51:45,340 --> 02:51:45,400
Boom.

3722
02:51:45,400 --> 02:51:45,460
Boom.

3723
02:51:45,460 --> 02:51:45,480
Boom.

3724
02:51:45,480 --> 02:51:46,060
Okay.

3725
02:51:48,680 --> 02:51:49,660
Got all them birds.

3726
02:51:56,730 --> 02:51:57,510
Upsy daisy.

3727
02:52:00,790 --> 02:52:01,410
All right.

3728
02:52:01,630 --> 02:52:02,290
Here we go.

3729
02:52:02,610 --> 02:52:04,170
Look at all those chickens.

3730
02:52:06,490 --> 02:52:07,490
Let's save real quick.

3731
02:52:11,970 --> 02:52:13,990
Not that I really need to, I think, but...

3732
02:52:13,990 --> 02:52:14,090
Jack?

3733
02:52:14,650 --> 02:52:15,070
Yeah.

3734
02:52:16,990 --> 02:52:17,730
Rose, please.

3735
02:52:17,930 --> 02:52:19,210
My code name.

3736
02:52:19,350 --> 02:52:19,710
Rose.

3737
02:52:20,230 --> 02:52:20,910
Rose, please.

3738
02:52:20,950 --> 02:52:22,390
Everybody is going to know my name is Jack.

3739
02:52:22,510 --> 02:52:22,710
Please.

3740
02:52:27,100 --> 02:52:28,820
I like Fat Man's fight though.

3741
02:52:28,860 --> 02:52:29,500
I think it's kind of fun.

3742
02:52:30,720 --> 02:52:31,760
Be careful, Jack.

3743
02:52:32,020 --> 02:52:32,600
Thank you.

3744
02:52:35,340 --> 02:52:35,740
Oh.

3745
02:52:40,040 --> 02:52:40,800
There he is.

3746
02:52:44,080 --> 02:52:44,980
I think we're okay.

3747
02:52:45,280 --> 02:52:45,680
Maybe.

3748
02:52:46,240 --> 02:52:47,520
Actually, I'm just going to box it.

3749
02:52:51,930 --> 02:52:53,510
I need to get my old box back.

3750
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:01,360
I need to get my box back.

3751
02:53:04,040 --> 02:53:04,660
Box one.

3752
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:05,400
Box two.

3753
02:53:05,900 --> 02:53:07,080
Box one, where are you?

3754
02:53:09,340 --> 02:53:10,420
Maybe it's in the next one.

3755
02:53:12,300 --> 02:53:13,600
She doesn't need his code name.

3756
02:53:13,760 --> 02:53:16,000
All she needs is for him to remember what's special about the date.

3757
02:53:25,190 --> 02:53:26,150
Here we go.

3758
02:53:27,930 --> 02:53:28,930
Oh, there it is.

3759
02:53:29,530 --> 02:53:30,330
Easy peasy.

3760
02:53:31,350 --> 02:53:32,630
Right there in the middle.

3761
02:53:32,890 --> 02:53:34,050
Well, we got time.

3762
02:53:34,510 --> 02:53:36,050
We have time to explore a little bit.

3763
02:53:38,290 --> 02:53:39,090
Right there.

3764
02:53:39,170 --> 02:53:40,970
Totally doesn't look like a trap or anything.

3765
02:53:41,750 --> 02:53:42,150
We got time.

3766
02:53:46,400 --> 02:53:49,420
Not at all, not at all, not at all.

3767
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,660
Looks totally not suspicious.

3768
02:53:53,500 --> 02:53:54,420
Nah.

3769
02:53:55,220 --> 02:53:56,360
Censor A.

3770
02:54:04,180 --> 02:54:05,100
Stinky.

3771
02:54:05,100 --> 02:54:06,260
Stinkiest area.

3772
02:54:11,200 --> 02:54:12,240
Sega, nice.

3773
02:54:12,300 --> 02:54:12,800
Stank.

3774
02:54:13,740 --> 02:54:14,340
Febreze!

3775
02:54:22,330 --> 02:54:24,370
See how close he can get to one second?

3776
02:54:26,490 --> 02:54:27,710
What was my time?

3777
02:54:31,190 --> 02:54:32,130
Oh my god.

3778
02:54:38,230 --> 02:54:40,710
You were briefed on this, Raiden.

3779
02:54:47,170 --> 02:54:49,310
I love Batman.

3780
02:54:49,810 --> 02:54:51,470
I love Batman.

3781
02:54:55,880 --> 02:54:57,010
He's such a freak.

3782
02:54:58,100 --> 02:54:59,910
He's so eccentric, I love him.

3783
02:55:02,100 --> 02:55:02,530
Yeah!

3784
02:55:08,210 --> 02:55:13,970
All the time with every moment of their existence and nothing else announces its own end with such a fanfare.

3785
02:55:14,470 --> 02:55:15,890
Glad you could make it.

3786
02:55:15,890 --> 02:55:16,770
This little straw.

3787
02:55:24,620 --> 02:55:25,700
Oh yeah.

3788
02:55:26,100 --> 02:55:26,480
Yum.

3789
02:55:27,120 --> 02:55:28,080
Good year.

3790
02:55:28,920 --> 02:55:31,060
Let's drink to Stillman, shall we?

3791
02:55:31,220 --> 02:55:31,720
Oof.

3792
02:55:31,900 --> 02:55:34,600
If you destroy the big shell, you'll never collect your ransom.

3793
02:55:34,820 --> 02:55:35,780
I don't care about that.

3794
02:55:36,700 --> 02:55:37,880
What are you talking about?

3795
02:55:37,880 --> 02:55:38,340
Yum.

3796
02:55:38,620 --> 02:55:40,640
Thirty billion dollars in cash.

3797
02:55:43,820 --> 02:55:46,820
Oh, he's laughing.

3798
02:55:47,260 --> 02:55:48,960
So that's what's going on, huh?

3799
02:55:49,020 --> 02:55:50,220
What the hell are you talking about?

3800
02:55:50,300 --> 02:55:50,720
What the hell?

3801
02:55:51,660 --> 02:55:53,260
Oh, you'll know soon enough.

3802
02:55:53,360 --> 02:55:53,820
Cool.

3803
02:55:53,920 --> 02:55:56,040
And I could care less what they plan to do.

3804
02:55:57,400 --> 02:55:59,440
My ambitions are much more simple.

3805
02:55:59,920 --> 02:56:02,600
To be the most famous bomber of them all.

3806
02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:03,820
You're nuts.

3807
02:56:04,040 --> 02:56:05,700
No one's going to give a damn about you.

3808
02:56:05,920 --> 02:56:07,320
Oh yes, they will.

3809
02:56:07,480 --> 02:56:11,140
I'll go down in history, as the man who beat Peter Stillman.

3810
02:56:11,200 --> 02:56:11,480
Ah, yeah.

3811
02:56:11,480 --> 02:56:14,220
That's the only reason I assisted them.

3812
02:56:14,380 --> 02:56:15,760
Like hell you beat Stillman.

3813
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:16,740
He had your number.

3814
02:56:16,760 --> 02:56:17,460
What did you say?

3815
02:56:17,540 --> 02:56:18,960
You have nothing of his courage.

3816
02:56:19,560 --> 02:56:21,660
They keep talking over each other.

3817
02:56:21,700 --> 02:56:22,220
It's so funny.

3818
02:56:23,180 --> 02:56:26,700
That croc died a dishonorable death six months ago.

3819
02:56:27,320 --> 02:56:28,360
Six months ago.

3820
02:56:29,180 --> 02:56:30,820
The liquidation of Dead Cell.

3821
02:56:31,220 --> 02:56:32,380
Call it what you want.

3822
02:56:32,500 --> 02:56:34,300
Only the right stuff survive that hell.

3823
02:56:35,620 --> 02:56:36,980
Set me free, you know.

3824
02:56:38,140 --> 02:56:39,980
Open the way to a new dimension.

3825
02:56:40,640 --> 02:56:41,160
Dimension.

3826
02:56:41,960 --> 02:56:45,400
So that I can become the emperor among detonation devotees.

3827
02:56:45,640 --> 02:56:49,600
You're nothing but a common criminal and that's the only way people will ever remember you.

3828
02:56:49,860 --> 02:56:54,660
A new dimension.

3829
02:56:55,140 --> 02:56:57,400
That's why I dislike boorish military types.

3830
02:56:59,480 --> 02:57:01,520
It's time to start the party.

3831
02:57:01,900 --> 02:57:02,880
Yeah, the party.

3832
02:57:03,420 --> 02:57:04,720
This is how it works.

3833
02:57:04,960 --> 02:57:06,060
I plant a bomb.

3834
02:57:06,180 --> 02:57:08,420
And it'll explode soon after that.

3835
02:57:08,520 --> 02:57:08,760
Okay.

3836
02:57:09,980 --> 02:57:12,780
If you prefer to stay in one piece, you'll have to decide...

3837
02:57:15,300 --> 02:57:16,700
Laugh and grow fat.

3838
02:57:16,940 --> 02:57:17,180
Yeah!

3839
02:57:19,100 --> 02:57:20,460
He said the thing!

3840
02:57:22,720 --> 02:57:24,600
Laugh and grow fat!

3841
02:57:29,510 --> 02:57:29,950
Hey,

3842
02:57:37,520 --> 02:57:38,200
don't shoot me, man.

3843
02:57:38,280 --> 02:57:38,740
Don't shoot me.

3844
02:57:38,860 --> 02:57:39,600
I'm not ready yet.

3845
02:57:53,900 --> 02:57:54,780
Is that all of them?

3846
02:57:56,560 --> 02:57:59,790
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

3847
02:58:00,110 --> 02:58:00,830
I saw that.

3848
02:58:01,370 --> 02:58:01,750
Two!

3849
02:58:01,970 --> 02:58:02,070
Two!

3850
02:58:02,150 --> 02:58:02,650
Your favorite.

3851
02:58:03,430 --> 02:58:08,050
I literally just disarmed the other two.

3852
02:58:08,110 --> 02:58:08,510
Oh my god.

3853
02:58:10,750 --> 02:58:12,250
I just disarmed the other two.

3854
02:58:12,310 --> 02:58:12,510
Come on.

3855
02:58:14,170 --> 02:58:14,550
Okay.

3856
02:58:17,550 --> 02:58:17,930
Um...

3857
02:58:20,840 --> 02:58:22,180
Oh, I gotta get his head.

3858
02:58:22,940 --> 02:58:23,320
Um...

3859
02:58:23,820 --> 02:58:24,380
There we go.

3860
02:58:24,960 --> 02:58:26,480
I'm pulling a short piece.

3861
02:58:29,460 --> 02:58:29,900
What's up?

3862
02:58:34,480 --> 02:58:35,220
Where is it?

3863
02:58:35,460 --> 02:58:36,400
Dou, dou.

3864
02:58:40,830 --> 02:58:42,150
Don't shoot the bird, man.

3865
02:58:43,010 --> 02:58:43,450
Dou!

3866
02:58:43,970 --> 02:58:45,130
The way he falls.

3867
02:58:46,190 --> 02:58:48,230
I was wondering if I should do a, uh...

3868
02:58:48,230 --> 02:58:48,910
Oh, oh.

3869
02:58:50,270 --> 02:58:51,150
A uh...

3870
02:58:52,790 --> 02:58:53,230
Oh

3871
02:58:57,090 --> 02:58:57,650
my god.

3872
02:58:57,710 --> 02:58:58,150
What's the word?

3873
02:59:00,210 --> 02:59:01,350
Passive this run, I guess.

3874
02:59:01,590 --> 02:59:03,290
With the tranquilizer, but...

3875
02:59:04,190 --> 02:59:05,070
I think it's okay.

3876
02:59:05,070 --> 02:59:05,190
Okay.

3877
02:59:05,210 --> 02:59:05,710
Oh my god.

3878
02:59:06,550 --> 02:59:09,270
Maybe I should use auto-aim.

3879
02:59:19,200 --> 02:59:21,440
Are you gonna plant anymore or are you done?

3880
02:59:34,250 --> 02:59:35,170
Are you okay?

3881
02:59:36,550 --> 02:59:37,330
Are you okay, man?

3882
02:59:40,780 --> 02:59:43,360
Are you clo- Oh, one.

3883
02:59:43,620 --> 02:59:44,320
I got it.

3884
02:59:44,520 --> 02:59:45,260
More bombs!

3885
02:59:46,560 --> 02:59:47,780
You asked for it.

3886
02:59:48,080 --> 02:59:48,860
More bombs!

3887
02:59:54,590 --> 02:59:55,470
Where did he put the other one?

3888
02:59:55,610 --> 02:59:56,030
Oh, okay.

3889
02:59:58,810 --> 02:59:59,770
Wait, where is it?

3890
02:59:59,950 --> 03:00:01,730
That's the one I disarmed before.

3891
03:00:04,890 --> 03:00:06,030
It's not underneath, is it?

3892
03:00:07,550 --> 03:00:09,270
I'm right here, dummy!

3893
03:00:10,850 --> 03:00:11,670
Wait, where is it?

3894
03:00:11,930 --> 03:00:12,790
It's not this one.

3895
03:00:13,550 --> 03:00:13,910
Right?

3896
03:00:15,110 --> 03:00:16,890
This is the one I disarmed before.

3897
03:00:18,670 --> 03:00:19,310
Is this it?

3898
03:00:20,590 --> 03:00:20,910
Again?

3899
03:00:22,810 --> 03:00:24,230
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god!

3900
03:00:24,570 --> 03:00:24,890
Where?

3901
03:00:24,970 --> 03:00:25,470
Oh, here it is!

3902
03:00:29,890 --> 03:00:30,930
Hey, where did you go?

3903
03:00:33,570 --> 03:00:34,050
My bad.

3904
03:00:51,470 --> 03:00:51,510
Hey.

3905
03:00:51,870 --> 03:00:52,570
Hey, hey, hey.

3906
03:00:52,710 --> 03:00:53,210
Calm down.

3907
03:01:12,460 --> 03:01:12,980
There we go.

3908
03:01:18,530 --> 03:01:19,170
He's aggroed!

3909
03:01:21,870 --> 03:01:22,510
He's aggroed!

3910
03:01:27,980 --> 03:01:29,140
Oh, I need to reload.

3911
03:01:31,880 --> 03:01:33,340
Does that reload again?

3912
03:01:33,480 --> 03:01:34,740
Like in the original?

3913
03:01:35,780 --> 03:01:36,960
Un-equipping and re-equipping?

3914
03:01:37,120 --> 03:01:38,080
I don't think it does, right?

3915
03:01:43,720 --> 03:01:44,200
Oh, it does?

3916
03:01:49,430 --> 03:01:50,110
Where is he?

3917
03:01:53,390 --> 03:01:53,710
Ouch!

3918
03:01:54,190 --> 03:01:54,690
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

3919
03:02:01,570 --> 03:02:02,110
Oh, it dies.

3920
03:02:02,230 --> 03:02:02,430
Nice.

3921
03:02:02,430 --> 03:02:02,510
Nice.

3922
03:02:11,300 --> 03:02:12,260
Good luck.

3923
03:02:12,460 --> 03:02:13,040
Thank you.

3924
03:02:13,100 --> 03:02:14,180
This fight is actually pretty fun.

3925
03:02:16,320 --> 03:02:17,620
Because it's like a...

3926
03:02:17,620 --> 03:02:19,000
More bombs!

3927
03:02:21,420 --> 03:02:22,580
Oh, come on Ryzen.

3928
03:02:24,380 --> 03:02:25,140
Get his head.

3929
03:02:25,780 --> 03:02:26,640
Get his head.

3930
03:02:27,100 --> 03:02:27,520
Get his head.

3931
03:02:28,620 --> 03:02:29,880
Oh, he's right there.

3932
03:02:32,040 --> 03:02:33,000
More bombs!

3933
03:02:39,570 --> 03:02:39,930
One?

3934
03:02:39,930 --> 03:02:40,750
Oh, one.

3935
03:02:40,870 --> 03:02:41,110
Here.

3936
03:02:50,540 --> 03:02:50,900
Two?

3937
03:02:54,020 --> 03:02:54,480
I know.

3938
03:02:54,860 --> 03:02:56,100
I'm getting on it.

3939
03:02:57,160 --> 03:02:58,320
He's watching me defuse it.

3940
03:02:59,220 --> 03:03:00,020
I'm doing it!

3941
03:03:00,320 --> 03:03:02,520
Oh my god.

3942
03:03:06,890 --> 03:03:08,210
I did your bombs.

3943
03:03:08,310 --> 03:03:09,070
I did your bombs.

3944
03:03:09,170 --> 03:03:09,770
I did your bombs.

3945
03:03:10,710 --> 03:03:11,410
Come on, Batman.

3946
03:03:11,490 --> 03:03:11,890
Where are you?

3947
03:03:13,890 --> 03:03:14,750
Come over this way.

3948
03:03:15,670 --> 03:03:16,370
Where are you?

3949
03:03:18,290 --> 03:03:19,370
There you are.

3950
03:03:21,250 --> 03:03:22,350
There you are.

3951
03:03:22,350 --> 03:03:25,910
Where did you go?

3952
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:44,160
That was so close.

3953
03:03:46,460 --> 03:03:49,590
I don't know where he is.

3954
03:03:50,550 --> 03:03:51,790
Just shoot, Ryden.

3955
03:03:51,910 --> 03:03:53,170
Just shoot, Ryden.

3956
03:03:53,310 --> 03:03:53,950
Oh my god.

3957
03:03:53,970 --> 03:03:54,890
He's doing sick...

3958
03:03:55,410 --> 03:03:57,170
He's doing sick flips and stuff.

3959
03:03:57,210 --> 03:03:58,330
He's doing tricks and stuff.

3960
03:04:00,630 --> 03:04:01,690
Oh, I got to reload.

3961
03:04:01,810 --> 03:04:02,010
Hold on.

3962
03:04:02,850 --> 03:04:03,450
There we go.

3963
03:04:07,210 --> 03:04:07,490
STOP!

3964
03:04:10,330 --> 03:04:11,550
Don't come after me!

3965
03:04:12,010 --> 03:04:13,750
Don't come after me like that is spooky.

3966
03:04:20,730 --> 03:04:21,850
Don't come after me like that is spooky.

3967
03:04:21,850 --> 03:04:22,470
Oh, shoot.

3968
03:04:25,310 --> 03:04:26,590
He's so everywhere.

3969
03:04:30,970 --> 03:04:32,290
I also got to reload.

3970
03:04:32,290 --> 03:04:32,390
Reload.

3971
03:04:43,560 --> 03:04:44,520
You're so fast!

3972
03:04:45,660 --> 03:04:47,280
I'm just gonna do that for now.

3973
03:04:48,840 --> 03:04:51,640
Just so we have, you know, a little bit of...

3974
03:04:52,920 --> 03:04:54,240
A little bit of buffer.

3975
03:05:01,580 --> 03:05:02,160
That's right.

3976
03:05:02,420 --> 03:05:03,280
That's what I thought.

3977
03:05:05,040 --> 03:05:05,980
That's what I thought.

3978
03:05:10,920 --> 03:05:11,580
There we go.

3979
03:05:11,860 --> 03:05:12,260
Reload.

3980
03:05:14,240 --> 03:05:16,800
Where'd you go?

3981
03:05:20,670 --> 03:05:21,070
Idiot.

3982
03:05:21,110 --> 03:05:21,270
Oh.

3983
03:05:22,670 --> 03:05:23,310
There we go.

3984
03:05:23,970 --> 03:05:24,550
Oh my god.

3985
03:05:24,610 --> 03:05:24,910
Please.

3986
03:05:26,810 --> 03:05:27,330
There we go.

3987
03:05:32,400 --> 03:05:34,000
When are we getting more bombs, Batman?

3988
03:05:35,180 --> 03:05:35,960
More bombs!

3989
03:05:36,160 --> 03:05:37,320
This time for more bombs!

3990
03:05:38,680 --> 03:05:39,920
When are we getting more bombs?

3991
03:05:40,060 --> 03:05:40,340
More bombs, Batman!

3992
03:05:42,880 --> 03:05:43,380
Oh.

3993
03:05:43,640 --> 03:05:44,140
Woah!

3994
03:05:46,060 --> 03:05:48,000
When are we getting more bombs, Batman?

3995
03:05:49,420 --> 03:05:50,240
Where are you?

3996
03:05:51,660 --> 03:05:52,840
I just need one more.

3997
03:05:53,460 --> 03:05:54,600
Time getting him down.

3998
03:05:56,120 --> 03:05:56,780
There we go.

3999
03:06:03,290 --> 03:06:03,790
Aww.

4000
03:06:03,970 --> 03:06:05,030
We didn't get more bombs.

4001
03:06:08,250 --> 03:06:09,010
First try.

4002
03:06:09,330 --> 03:06:09,550
Yeah!

4003
03:06:10,590 --> 03:06:12,390
This one's not so bad, honestly.

4004
03:06:15,170 --> 03:06:17,470
Because he's so, like, all over.

4005
03:06:17,690 --> 03:06:19,750
He doesn't aggro all the time.

4006
03:06:22,610 --> 03:06:23,430
Alright, Batman.

4007
03:06:24,030 --> 03:06:24,750
Oh no.

4008
03:06:25,290 --> 03:06:25,890
Batman!

4009
03:06:26,310 --> 03:06:27,110
It's just the wine.

4010
03:06:27,210 --> 03:06:28,390
It's just the wine.

4011
03:06:28,770 --> 03:06:30,390
The party!

4012
03:06:38,210 --> 03:06:38,810
Oh!

4013
03:06:38,810 --> 03:06:39,450
What's that?

4014
03:06:40,730 --> 03:06:42,610
Now I have nothing to wear to the party!

4015
03:06:42,610 --> 03:06:43,250
What is this?

4016
03:06:44,790 --> 03:06:46,350
I have beautiful hands.

4017
03:06:46,490 --> 03:06:47,270
Yeah, he does.

4018
03:06:47,650 --> 03:06:49,790
These delicate hands can craft works of art.

4019
03:06:49,910 --> 03:06:52,310
He puts on so much moisturizer on these hands.

4020
03:06:52,590 --> 03:06:53,830
Brian didn't grab his hands!

4021
03:06:53,950 --> 03:06:54,810
Feel how soft they are.

4022
03:06:54,970 --> 03:06:57,650
It's the switch for the biggest bomb of the entire place.

4023
03:06:57,710 --> 03:06:59,510
I've always wanted to hold fat man's hands.

4024
03:07:02,470 --> 03:07:02,910
I've always wanted to hold fat man's hands.

4025
03:07:02,910 --> 03:07:03,230
No use.

4026
03:07:03,550 --> 03:07:06,150
Once it's activated, there's no stopping the count.

4027
03:07:06,750 --> 03:07:07,950
Where did you plant it?

4028
03:07:08,010 --> 03:07:08,890
Where did you plant it?

4029
03:07:08,890 --> 03:07:10,130
Where is it?

4030
03:07:10,270 --> 03:07:11,570
Somewhere in this area.

4031
03:07:12,190 --> 03:07:12,910
Don't worry.

4032
03:07:13,210 --> 03:07:14,370
It's very close by.

4033
03:07:15,570 --> 03:07:17,230
Right where I can see ya.

4034
03:07:18,630 --> 03:07:19,690
Where is it?

4035
03:07:20,830 --> 03:07:21,590
Go ahead.

4036
03:07:21,790 --> 03:07:22,390
Shoot me.

4037
03:07:22,470 --> 03:07:23,390
I'm already dead.

4038
03:07:23,710 --> 03:07:23,950
No!

4039
03:07:24,630 --> 03:07:25,070
Damn!

4040
03:07:26,750 --> 03:07:28,050
Think you can find it?

4041
03:07:28,990 --> 03:07:31,770
When it goes off, it'll take the big shell with it.

4042
03:07:31,870 --> 03:07:32,290
Oh my god.

4043
03:07:32,510 --> 03:07:33,710
Tell me where I can find the bomb!

4044
03:07:34,470 --> 03:07:35,770
That's your problem.

4045
03:07:37,830 --> 03:07:38,310
Die.

4046
03:07:38,390 --> 03:07:38,870
That's your problem.

4047
03:07:38,890 --> 03:07:39,190
Die.

4048
03:07:39,830 --> 03:07:41,430
Bring it on, I say.

4049
03:07:41,550 --> 03:07:42,770
They'll be happy too.

4050
03:07:44,130 --> 03:07:46,810
I die here and start my legend.

4051
03:07:47,330 --> 03:07:50,130
Too bad you won't be around to see the movies.

4052
03:07:50,510 --> 03:07:50,690
No!

4053
03:07:53,270 --> 03:07:55,410
Laugh and grow fat.

4054
03:07:55,850 --> 03:07:56,290
Yeah!

4055
03:07:59,130 --> 03:08:00,150
Fat man!

4056
03:08:04,790 --> 03:08:06,510
Laugh and grow fat.

4057
03:08:09,950 --> 03:08:11,410
Come here, buddy.

4058
03:08:11,890 --> 03:08:12,910
Come on, fat man.

4059
03:08:13,230 --> 03:08:14,430
Laugh and grow fat.

4060
03:08:14,930 --> 03:08:16,330
Where's the bomb, fat man?

4061
03:08:17,430 --> 03:08:20,190
Getting the Peter Stillman is so messed up.

4062
03:08:21,650 --> 03:08:23,470
Getting the Peter Stillman...

4063
03:08:24,350 --> 03:08:25,510
You're a monster.

4064
03:08:26,470 --> 03:08:27,230
Thank you!

4065
03:08:27,910 --> 03:08:28,950
Thanks for the pun treatment.

4066
03:08:29,250 --> 03:08:30,990
Fat man is one of my favorite boss fights.

4067
03:08:31,510 --> 03:08:34,430
He's like if Vulcan, Raven and Running Man had a weird baby.

4068
03:08:34,610 --> 03:08:35,190
It's true!

4069
03:08:37,430 --> 03:08:37,950
Um...

4070
03:08:37,950 --> 03:08:38,810
What?

4071
03:08:38,810 --> 03:08:38,890
What?

4072
03:08:39,830 --> 03:08:41,730
Oh, I'm facing the wrong way.

4073
03:08:42,310 --> 03:08:43,270
It's like where'd it go?

4074
03:08:44,710 --> 03:08:45,670
Anyway, um...

4075
03:08:45,670 --> 03:08:46,690
That was easy.

4076
03:08:48,210 --> 03:08:49,770
Laugh and grow fat.

4077
03:08:49,770 --> 03:08:50,730
Good work, Raiden.

4078
03:08:50,890 --> 03:08:53,070
Looks like all the bombs are neutralized.

4079
03:08:53,710 --> 03:08:55,090
Where's the bomb, fat man?

4080
03:08:55,210 --> 03:08:55,710
Laugh and grow fat.

4081
03:08:57,370 --> 03:09:00,930
Colonel, fat man didn't seem to know about the ransom demands.

4082
03:09:01,130 --> 03:09:01,970
Yeah, how curious.

4083
03:09:01,990 --> 03:09:03,630
Intentionally kept in the dark, I'd say.

4084
03:09:03,870 --> 03:09:07,410
He seemed to be coming from a very different place from the other terrorists.

4085
03:09:07,410 --> 03:09:08,090
Hmm.

4086
03:09:08,930 --> 03:09:10,810
Raiden, a lot of hostages.

4087
03:09:11,050 --> 03:09:12,350
Our president included.

4088
03:09:12,630 --> 03:09:13,930
Are still in danger.

4089
03:09:14,170 --> 03:09:16,870
Keep your mind focused on protecting them.

4090
03:09:17,050 --> 03:09:17,390
President!

4091
03:09:17,850 --> 03:09:18,430
Johnson!

4092
03:09:18,430 --> 03:09:19,110
What are my orders?

4093
03:09:20,690 --> 03:09:23,330
We have no idea where he is.

4094
03:09:23,530 --> 03:09:25,730
You haven't been in the central core yet.

4095
03:09:25,910 --> 03:09:27,690
I suggest you start there.

4096
03:09:27,910 --> 03:09:28,590
What are my orders?

4097
03:09:29,170 --> 03:09:31,030
Wait, I have another call.

4098
03:09:31,310 --> 03:09:32,270
Want me to take it?

4099
03:09:32,390 --> 03:09:32,810
Yeah.

4100
03:09:32,990 --> 03:09:33,890
Oh, no.

4101
03:09:34,370 --> 03:09:36,390
Best to keep our presence unknown.

4102
03:09:37,410 --> 03:09:37,790
Okay.

4103
03:09:38,590 --> 03:09:39,030
Hello?

4104
03:09:39,170 --> 03:09:39,430
Hello?

4105
03:09:39,870 --> 03:09:41,190
How you doing, kid?

4106
03:09:41,550 --> 03:09:43,150
Plissken, is everything alright?

4107
03:09:43,370 --> 03:09:44,390
I just killed fat man.

4108
03:09:44,830 --> 03:09:46,350
Looks like I was out cold for a while.

4109
03:09:46,610 --> 03:09:47,910
How did you manage to stay alive?

4110
03:09:48,290 --> 03:09:49,890
Had a little help from a friend.

4111
03:09:50,070 --> 03:09:52,110
What about the bomb?

4112
03:09:53,010 --> 03:09:53,450
Diffused.

4113
03:09:53,450 --> 03:09:54,810
And fat man, too.

4114
03:09:55,190 --> 03:09:56,030
That's good news.

4115
03:09:56,370 --> 03:09:57,230
Aw, fat man.

4116
03:09:59,550 --> 03:10:01,750
Plissken is just taking all sorts of naps, isn't he?

4117
03:10:01,870 --> 03:10:02,210
What?

4118
03:10:02,210 --> 03:10:07,590
If the big shell blows up, the explosion is expected to produce massive amounts of toxins.

4119
03:10:08,050 --> 03:10:09,610
Never heard anything about that.

4120
03:10:09,950 --> 03:10:10,350
Huh?

4121
03:10:10,810 --> 03:10:13,950
Looks like there's not much danger of that in any case.

4122
03:10:14,130 --> 03:10:16,170
But the central core is starting to flood.

4123
03:10:16,370 --> 03:10:17,690
It won't last much longer.

4124
03:10:18,030 --> 03:10:20,790
What about the president and the other hostages?

4125
03:10:21,050 --> 03:10:21,270
No!

4126
03:10:21,350 --> 03:10:22,370
They weren't in shell two.

4127
03:10:22,590 --> 03:10:23,870
They must be in shell one.

4128
03:10:24,150 --> 03:10:26,630
We need to get the hostages out of here now.

4129
03:10:26,910 --> 03:10:27,270
No!

4130
03:10:27,270 --> 03:10:29,270
It's too far from Manhattan for a swim.

4131
03:10:29,270 --> 03:10:30,890
What about the lifeboats?

4132
03:10:31,010 --> 03:10:32,290
There doesn't seem to be any.

4133
03:10:32,430 --> 03:10:32,650
What?

4134
03:10:32,810 --> 03:10:35,530
That doesn't seem up to code.

4135
03:10:38,070 --> 03:10:38,510
Gilberta!

4136
03:10:38,790 --> 03:10:39,850
Welcome to Mambooship, thank you!

4137
03:10:41,850 --> 03:10:42,290
Darn.

4138
03:10:42,330 --> 03:10:43,630
It'll take more than a single trip.

4139
03:10:43,910 --> 03:10:44,790
We'll have to come back.

4140
03:10:45,110 --> 03:10:46,570
Can you pilot a chopper?

4141
03:10:46,650 --> 03:10:49,070
No, but I brought a gearhead with me.

4142
03:10:49,330 --> 03:10:50,230
He's a good guy.

4143
03:10:50,430 --> 03:10:51,370
I'll introduce you later.

4144
03:10:51,790 --> 03:10:53,850
Plissken, I'm on the heliport right now.

4145
03:10:54,070 --> 03:10:55,470
But I don't see their harrier.

4146
03:10:55,650 --> 03:10:56,570
It's out somewhere.

4147
03:10:59,270 --> 03:11:01,270
The chances with a harrier after us are close to nothing.

4148
03:11:01,470 --> 03:11:01,830
True.

4149
03:11:01,930 --> 03:11:03,050
Do you know where the president is?

4150
03:11:03,230 --> 03:11:03,690
No.

4151
03:11:03,810 --> 03:11:04,950
That one's all yours.

4152
03:11:05,250 --> 03:11:07,630
The president is at the top of our rescue list.

4153
03:11:07,830 --> 03:11:09,170
These are our orders, Lt.

4154
03:11:09,370 --> 03:11:10,090
J.G.

4155
03:11:10,170 --> 03:11:12,130
Your orders, not mine.

4156
03:11:12,370 --> 03:11:16,850
Your orders, not mine.

4157
03:11:19,010 --> 03:11:20,090
Your orders, not mine.

4158
03:11:20,090 --> 03:11:21,890
Fab man.

4159
03:11:26,450 --> 03:11:28,530
Your orders, not mine.

4160
03:11:28,750 --> 03:11:29,750
He's heavy!

4161
03:11:34,810 --> 03:11:37,490
I can barely carry him for so long.

4162
03:11:38,950 --> 03:11:40,050
Come on, Fab man.

4163
03:11:40,210 --> 03:11:40,670
Come on.

4164
03:11:40,730 --> 03:11:41,310
Here we go.

4165
03:11:44,650 --> 03:11:46,330
He's ragdolling him around.

4166
03:11:46,850 --> 03:11:47,850
Where's his hands?

4167
03:11:47,930 --> 03:11:49,310
Can I take his skates?

4168
03:11:49,950 --> 03:11:51,150
Look at them hands.

4169
03:11:53,810 --> 03:11:55,470
Can I take his rollerblades?

4170
03:11:58,490 --> 03:12:00,170
Good night, sweet prince.

4171
03:12:00,810 --> 03:12:01,390
Good night, sweet prince.

4172
03:12:10,770 --> 03:12:12,030
What else is around here?

4173
03:12:13,990 --> 03:12:14,470
What else is around here?

4174
03:12:14,470 --> 03:12:14,810
Any snacks?

4175
03:12:15,810 --> 03:12:17,030
Not that I really need any.

4176
03:12:17,250 --> 03:12:17,510
Not that I really need any.

4177
03:12:19,310 --> 03:12:20,710
We handle that pretty easily.

4178
03:12:24,490 --> 03:12:25,250
Any bullets?

4179
03:12:26,750 --> 03:12:27,430
Softly quiet.

4180
03:12:28,830 --> 03:12:30,050
Ryden's glutes are for show.

4181
03:12:30,930 --> 03:12:32,770
Not moving big weight, I guess.

4182
03:12:32,950 --> 03:12:33,590
I know, right?

4183
03:12:33,590 --> 03:12:35,850
This guy.

4184
03:12:36,230 --> 03:12:37,830
He's such a skinny weenie.

4185
03:12:40,730 --> 03:12:42,290
I fell on my chair.

4186
03:12:42,470 --> 03:12:42,750
Hold on.

4187
03:12:46,090 --> 03:12:47,790
The calm before the storm.

4188
03:12:51,490 --> 03:12:52,370
Oh my god!

4189
03:12:52,730 --> 03:12:53,590
It's a ninja!

4190
03:12:55,190 --> 03:12:56,510
Oh my god, it's an actual ninja.

4191
03:12:58,930 --> 03:12:59,570
Gray Fox!

4192
03:12:59,570 --> 03:13:00,030
Gray Fox!

4193
03:13:00,770 --> 03:13:01,970
Gray Fox!

4194
03:13:03,130 --> 03:13:04,270
I'm like you.

4195
03:13:04,390 --> 03:13:05,610
I have no name.

4196
03:13:05,710 --> 03:13:08,670
I ha- Are you Mr. X?

4197
03:13:09,930 --> 03:13:11,390
If you like.

4198
03:13:14,990 --> 03:13:16,210
What was that?

4199
03:13:17,690 --> 03:13:18,510
But come.

4200
03:13:18,670 --> 03:13:19,930
Let's get out of the open.

4201
03:13:20,190 --> 03:13:21,030
Follow me.

4202
03:13:22,330 --> 03:13:22,990
Follow me.

4203
03:13:24,450 --> 03:13:29,590
That's just- I mean- Mr. X has an accent.

4204
03:13:34,610 --> 03:13:35,450
Neither can I.

4205
03:13:36,970 --> 03:13:37,830
Gray Fox!

4206
03:13:38,850 --> 03:13:39,210
Gray Fox!

4207
03:13:39,210 --> 03:13:41,010
Just a messenger from a lalilulelo.

4208
03:13:41,530 --> 03:13:42,050
Lalilulelo?

4209
03:13:49,580 --> 03:13:50,580
I'm so sorry.

4210
03:13:50,920 --> 03:13:51,600
This is Silver, I think.

4211
03:13:51,820 --> 03:13:52,760
Safe from what?

4212
03:13:53,580 --> 03:13:54,540
Eavesdropping, of course.

4213
03:13:54,980 --> 03:13:55,240
Alright.

4214
03:13:55,500 --> 03:13:56,960
Why did you contact me?

4215
03:13:57,300 --> 03:13:58,840
I've been ordered to give you backup.

4216
03:13:59,080 --> 03:13:59,240
No.

4217
03:14:01,520 --> 03:14:03,400
Ordered by whom?

4218
03:14:04,320 --> 03:14:04,840
Speak!

4219
03:14:07,700 --> 03:14:07,980
Throat!

4220
03:14:08,920 --> 03:14:10,660
I'll decide whether I need to know.

4221
03:14:10,880 --> 03:14:13,600
You are not yet trusted to make such decisions.

4222
03:14:13,820 --> 03:14:14,420
What do you mean by that?

4223
03:14:14,900 --> 03:14:17,060
I'll tell you something you do need to know instead.

4224
03:14:17,360 --> 03:14:19,100
The current location of the president.

4225
03:14:19,200 --> 03:14:19,640
What?

4226
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:20,620
I'll take that.

4227
03:14:21,080 --> 03:14:24,360
The person who knows the current location of the president.

4228
03:14:24,640 --> 03:14:25,280
Who is it?

4229
03:14:25,760 --> 03:14:28,160
A secret service agent named Ames.

4230
03:14:28,520 --> 03:14:29,000
Ames!

4231
03:14:31,020 --> 03:14:32,300
Secret service, huh?

4232
03:14:32,500 --> 03:14:32,900
Okay.

4233
03:14:34,160 --> 03:14:34,920
I'll be honest.

4234
03:14:34,980 --> 03:14:39,280
The first time I played this, I did not notice the accent even a little bit.

4235
03:14:39,380 --> 03:14:39,620
I'm sorry.

4236
03:14:40,660 --> 03:14:43,860
If you're within range, you should be able to communicate.

4237
03:14:43,900 --> 03:14:47,320
I did not notice their accent even a tiny bit.

4238
03:14:47,640 --> 03:14:49,720
There's no reason for me to believe any of this.

4239
03:14:49,800 --> 03:14:50,740
Do you understand that?

4240
03:14:50,980 --> 03:14:51,880
Of course.

4241
03:14:52,020 --> 03:14:53,560
But you also have no choice.

4242
03:14:53,600 --> 03:14:55,880
I think I was just so like, oh my gosh, Gray Fox!

4243
03:14:56,100 --> 03:14:57,280
Do you have any other leads?

4244
03:14:57,720 --> 03:14:59,340
Where are those hostages?

4245
03:15:00,280 --> 03:15:00,720
Hahaha.

4246
03:15:01,500 --> 03:15:01,940
Hahaha.

4247
03:15:05,750 --> 03:15:07,010
You must be Ames.

4248
03:15:11,730 --> 03:15:12,170
Oh!

4249
03:15:12,750 --> 03:15:13,490
Oh my gosh.

4250
03:15:13,610 --> 03:15:16,270
The hostages are being held in the B1 conference hall.

4251
03:15:16,410 --> 03:15:17,650
In the Shell 1 core.

4252
03:15:17,890 --> 03:15:19,030
You'll find Ames there.

4253
03:15:19,870 --> 03:15:20,810
What does he look like?

4254
03:15:21,010 --> 03:15:22,770
We don't know if it is indeed a he.

4255
03:15:22,950 --> 03:15:24,470
I've never met this person either.

4256
03:15:24,770 --> 03:15:27,370
How am I supposed to look for someone without even a description?

4257
03:15:27,710 --> 03:15:29,310
I like how they're just like, um, hello?

4258
03:15:29,510 --> 03:15:30,430
That could be a woman.

4259
03:15:30,470 --> 03:15:31,470
Ames has a pacemaker.

4260
03:15:34,670 --> 03:15:38,490
Do you expect me to walk up to these hostages and listen to every one of their heartbeats?

4261
03:15:38,570 --> 03:15:40,690
The sound is too minute to detect an amplifier.

4262
03:15:41,070 --> 03:15:41,970
You'd be captured immediately.

4263
03:15:42,530 --> 03:15:43,850
So what am I supposed to do?

4264
03:15:44,090 --> 03:15:45,490
Use the directional microphone.

4265
03:15:45,930 --> 03:15:47,250
There's one somewhere in the core.

4266
03:15:47,490 --> 03:15:47,930
Oh, in the core.

4267
03:15:47,970 --> 03:15:48,110
Okay.

4268
03:15:48,170 --> 03:15:48,910
We gotta go find...

4269
03:15:48,910 --> 03:15:49,090
Okay.

4270
03:15:49,230 --> 03:15:50,370
Get the microphone.

4271
03:15:51,910 --> 03:15:53,030
Get to Ames.

4272
03:15:53,310 --> 03:15:54,270
Get to the president.

4273
03:15:54,850 --> 03:15:55,670
Easy peasy.

4274
03:15:55,750 --> 03:15:56,430
We got this.

4275
03:15:57,030 --> 03:15:57,750
Take this.

4276
03:15:58,010 --> 03:15:58,410
What's that?

4277
03:15:59,410 --> 03:16:02,190
This security panel will unlock all level 2 security doors.

4278
03:16:02,190 --> 03:16:02,670
Level 2!

4279
03:16:05,750 --> 03:16:07,130
It's called a pan guard.

4280
03:16:07,350 --> 03:16:09,970
It works together with your body's own electronic field.

4281
03:16:10,110 --> 03:16:10,790
Yeah, I have one.

4282
03:16:11,530 --> 03:16:12,310
Nice butt.

4283
03:16:12,310 --> 03:16:14,810
The door is more heavy than any other section of the big shell.

4284
03:16:15,550 --> 03:16:17,190
You'll get nowhere just like that.

4285
03:16:17,370 --> 03:16:18,630
Okay, what do you want me to do?

4286
03:16:18,690 --> 03:16:19,310
Try this instead.

4287
03:16:21,050 --> 03:16:22,210
One of the terrorists?

4288
03:16:23,650 --> 03:16:25,150
One of the terrorists?

4289
03:16:25,830 --> 03:16:27,870
You want me to dress up like one of them?

4290
03:16:30,210 --> 03:16:34,310
The surveillance camera won't let you on the elevator without the right uniform.

4291
03:16:34,790 --> 03:16:36,650
Do you want me to disguise myself?

4292
03:16:36,890 --> 03:16:37,310
Oh my gosh.

4293
03:16:37,430 --> 03:16:37,650
Yay!

4294
03:16:38,530 --> 03:16:40,710
We'll be undetectable!

4295
03:16:41,670 --> 03:16:44,390
Your new outfit will work in some areas, not others.

4296
03:16:44,570 --> 03:16:44,810
Oh.

4297
03:16:45,230 --> 03:16:47,930
The uniform alone won't fool you neither.

4298
03:16:48,090 --> 03:16:49,470
Not everybody has the same outfit.

4299
03:16:49,690 --> 03:16:51,230
Why doesn't everybody have the same outfit?

4300
03:16:51,610 --> 03:16:53,610
But I saw them carrying an AN-94.

4301
03:16:54,130 --> 03:16:57,350
All men assigned to the core section carry AKs.

4302
03:16:58,170 --> 03:17:02,230
So without an AK-74, someone will see through me really quick.

4303
03:17:02,350 --> 03:17:03,770
You could take care of the weapon.

4304
03:17:03,890 --> 03:17:04,710
Hey, hey.

4305
03:17:04,890 --> 03:17:06,630
He's getting scared over flies.

4306
03:17:07,290 --> 03:17:11,010
You'll also have to pass a retinal scan to get into the conference room.

4307
03:17:11,910 --> 03:17:13,550
Not the retinal scan!

4308
03:17:19,540 --> 03:17:20,100
Biometrics.

4309
03:17:20,280 --> 03:17:20,780
Crap.

4310
03:17:21,060 --> 03:17:21,620
Crap.

4311
03:17:21,780 --> 03:17:23,280
Oh, crap.

4312
03:17:24,360 --> 03:17:26,000
Deception is not an option here.

4313
03:17:26,140 --> 03:17:26,560
Okay.

4314
03:17:27,660 --> 03:17:28,680
Oh, crap.

4315
03:17:31,160 --> 03:17:32,660
I suggest you hurry.

4316
03:17:33,980 --> 03:17:35,000
I'm taking their eyes.

4317
03:17:35,500 --> 03:17:37,360
They have a nuclear weapon with them?

4318
03:17:38,760 --> 03:17:40,240
I am scooping them out.

4319
03:17:40,260 --> 03:17:40,840
I am scooping them out.

4320
03:17:40,840 --> 03:17:45,840
Even with the president as hostage, this is an island, and they have no visible means of escape.

4321
03:17:46,100 --> 03:17:46,820
Even with the president as hostage, this is an island, and they have no visible means of escape.

4322
03:17:46,820 --> 03:17:50,260
Even if they do have a nuke, the warhead is no good without an access code.

4323
03:17:50,500 --> 03:17:50,580
Even if they do have a nuke, the warhead is no good without an access code.

4324
03:17:50,580 --> 03:17:53,420
The security lockout can't be bypassed.

4325
03:17:53,480 --> 03:17:54,560
They don't need to.

4326
03:17:54,680 --> 03:17:55,720
They have the code.

4327
03:17:56,560 --> 03:17:57,040
What?

4328
03:17:57,320 --> 03:17:57,980
How I?

4329
03:17:59,700 --> 03:18:01,120
You saw it too, I believe.

4330
03:18:01,360 --> 03:18:03,120
The Navy man would have a handcuff.

4331
03:18:03,280 --> 03:18:03,620
Yeah?

4332
03:18:04,240 --> 03:18:04,900
Him, yeah.

4333
03:18:05,220 --> 03:18:06,220
The guy who's dead.

4334
03:18:06,520 --> 03:18:09,860
The other half of it is on the football, or the black case if you like.

4335
03:18:10,040 --> 03:18:10,500
Oh no!

4336
03:18:11,100 --> 03:18:11,980
The football!

4337
03:18:12,820 --> 03:18:14,180
And now they have it.

4338
03:18:14,420 --> 03:18:14,620
No!

4339
03:18:16,500 --> 03:18:17,700
How did they open it?

4340
03:18:19,340 --> 03:18:20,560
That guy had one job.

4341
03:18:23,180 --> 03:18:25,100
Why did they have to bring the football along?

4342
03:18:25,280 --> 03:18:27,580
To a decontamination plant of all places?

4343
03:18:27,940 --> 03:18:29,140
But they did have to.

4344
03:18:29,700 --> 03:18:34,420
Because, after all, the big shell is the farthest thing from a clean-up plant there is.

4345
03:18:34,560 --> 03:18:34,820
What?

4346
03:18:35,080 --> 03:18:38,140
Dead Cell didn't have to bring a nuke along with them.

4347
03:18:38,240 --> 03:18:38,800
Maybe.

4348
03:18:39,060 --> 03:18:40,380
It was right here to begin with.

4349
03:18:40,480 --> 03:18:42,860
Nothing in this affair is what it seems.

4350
03:18:43,220 --> 03:18:44,140
A cover-up.

4351
03:18:44,260 --> 03:18:45,080
But why?

4352
03:18:45,360 --> 03:18:46,000
For what?

4353
03:18:46,100 --> 03:18:47,160
For Metal Gear.

4354
03:18:48,740 --> 03:18:49,820
Metal Gear!

4355
03:18:54,910 --> 03:18:55,470
What?

4356
03:18:55,970 --> 03:18:56,890
Metal Gear?

4357
03:18:57,250 --> 03:18:58,270
The very same.

4358
03:18:58,270 --> 03:19:01,930
By the only capable vehicle, Shadow Moses came free.

4359
03:19:02,090 --> 03:19:05,030
This causes the R&D Center for its newest incarnation.

4360
03:19:05,490 --> 03:19:06,070
Oh my god.

4361
03:19:06,250 --> 03:19:08,010
What the hell is going on?

4362
03:19:08,090 --> 03:19:08,930
Ray is so cute.

4363
03:19:09,370 --> 03:19:10,770
Better ask James the rest.

4364
03:19:11,090 --> 03:19:13,990
Lowkey, welcome to the membership.

4365
03:19:13,990 --> 03:19:14,550
Thank you!

4366
03:19:15,530 --> 03:19:16,370
Metal Gear.

4367
03:19:18,930 --> 03:19:19,970
What's this for?

4368
03:19:20,290 --> 03:19:21,790
You might be glad you have it.

4369
03:19:21,870 --> 03:19:24,150
Keep the controller's vibration function on.

4370
03:19:24,390 --> 03:19:24,790
Oh, okay.

4371
03:19:24,930 --> 03:19:26,290
I have my controller's vibration...

4372
03:19:26,290 --> 03:19:27,550
What do I need a cell phone for?

4373
03:19:31,430 --> 03:19:32,350
I don't know.

4374
03:19:32,350 --> 03:19:33,190
Raiden's little gasp there.

4375
03:19:37,150 --> 03:19:39,530
Colonel, who was that man just now?

4376
03:19:39,850 --> 03:19:41,050
He's not one of ours.

4377
03:19:41,850 --> 03:19:44,210
No, we have no one like that in our unit.

4378
03:19:44,210 --> 03:19:45,350
Yeah, who the hell was that?

4379
03:19:45,630 --> 03:19:48,290
He said that the big shell was housing a new model of Metal Gear.

4380
03:19:48,690 --> 03:19:49,990
First I've heard of it.

4381
03:19:50,270 --> 03:19:52,530
Colonel, what are you not telling me?

4382
03:19:52,730 --> 03:19:54,870
I've been completely open with you, Raiden.

4383
03:19:54,990 --> 03:19:55,510
I don't know.

4384
03:19:55,930 --> 03:19:56,390
Colonel!

4385
03:19:58,270 --> 03:20:00,550
I don't know or everything I need to know.

4386
03:20:00,570 --> 03:20:01,310
I forgot you can zoom in.

4387
03:20:01,690 --> 03:20:02,430
Snap out of it, Raiden.

4388
03:20:03,530 --> 03:20:05,730
I'll have the Metal Gear rumor looked into.

4389
03:20:06,050 --> 03:20:08,470
You need to make contact with this Ames.

4390
03:20:08,590 --> 03:20:10,050
So you believe that ninja?

4391
03:20:10,330 --> 03:20:15,110
Since we have no leads on the president's current location, we have no other alternatives.

4392
03:20:15,450 --> 03:20:20,570
Right now, collect as much data as you can, including anything on Metal Gear.

4393
03:20:20,770 --> 03:20:21,270
Metal Gear.

4394
03:20:21,290 --> 03:20:21,970
Are those my orders?

4395
03:20:22,450 --> 03:20:23,270
Yes, they are.

4396
03:20:24,170 --> 03:20:28,450
Disguise yourself as an enemy soldier and infiltrate the Shell One core.

4397
03:20:28,490 --> 03:20:29,190
Where do you think you are?

4398
03:20:29,330 --> 03:20:29,750
Understood.

4399
03:20:31,310 --> 03:20:31,770
Okay.

4400
03:20:35,130 --> 03:20:35,590
Enhanced.

4401
03:20:42,880 --> 03:20:44,800
You believe that ninja but not Plissken?

4402
03:20:45,680 --> 03:20:47,380
What if Plissken is the ninja?

4403
03:20:50,940 --> 03:20:52,420
Plissken, do you read me?

4404
03:20:52,540 --> 03:20:53,700
He took over for Gray Fox.

4405
03:20:54,220 --> 03:20:56,900
I just ran into a guy decked out like a ninja.

4406
03:20:57,200 --> 03:20:57,700
A ninja?

4407
03:20:58,140 --> 03:20:58,580
Yeah.

4408
03:20:59,240 --> 03:21:00,760
Do you know anything about this?

4409
03:21:00,920 --> 03:21:01,380
Was it you?

4410
03:21:01,660 --> 03:21:01,660
No.

4411
03:21:01,680 --> 03:21:03,440
Can you trust that costumed freak?

4412
03:21:03,520 --> 03:21:04,400
Oh, it's definitely him.

4413
03:21:05,100 --> 03:21:07,360
But the colonel told me to follow the guy's instructions.

4414
03:21:07,740 --> 03:21:10,040
And like a good soldier, you'll do it, right?

4415
03:21:10,600 --> 03:21:12,320
I'll let you in on a little secret, kid.

4416
03:21:12,620 --> 03:21:16,520
The ninja that was publicized in the Shadow Moses incident no longer exists.

4417
03:21:16,920 --> 03:21:19,900
The guy you met has no connection whatsoever with the incident.

4418
03:21:20,200 --> 03:21:21,280
And how do you know that?

4419
03:21:21,660 --> 03:21:22,440
Because I do.

4420
03:21:23,240 --> 03:21:25,440
Just be careful who you trust, okay?

4421
03:21:25,660 --> 03:21:26,960
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

4422
03:21:27,700 --> 03:21:27,920
Hahaha.

4423
03:21:30,140 --> 03:21:30,720
Colonel!

4424
03:21:31,060 --> 03:21:32,800
You have some splaining to do.

4425
03:21:33,360 --> 03:21:37,240
Raiden, make contact with Ames and find out where the president is.

4426
03:21:37,420 --> 03:21:37,700
Okay.

4427
03:21:37,720 --> 03:21:42,840
Our information indicates that Ames is being held in the B1 level of Shell One's core.

4428
03:21:43,120 --> 03:21:45,100
Head for the core of Shell One.

4429
03:21:45,160 --> 03:21:46,600
Head for the core of Shell One.

4430
03:21:46,600 --> 03:21:48,560
Shell One's core has extremely tight security.

4431
03:21:49,260 --> 03:21:51,260
Impersonate an enemy personnel to infiltrate the section.

4432
03:21:51,260 --> 03:21:51,720
But I need the weapon.

4433
03:21:52,180 --> 03:21:57,020
For a proper disguise, select the enemy field uniform you receive from the ninja.

4434
03:21:57,700 --> 03:21:58,920
This will allow you to blend in.

4435
03:21:59,400 --> 03:22:01,440
But you still need one more thing.

4436
03:22:01,500 --> 03:22:01,860
The gun!

4437
03:22:02,280 --> 03:22:05,340
It will look suspicious if you're not carrying the standard equipment.

4438
03:22:05,720 --> 03:22:09,480
All personnel in the core are equipped with AK-74Us.

4439
03:22:10,320 --> 03:22:10,800
That's wrong.

4440
03:22:13,720 --> 03:22:18,260
I feel like I'm hearing more and more of these.

4441
03:22:18,680 --> 03:22:20,260
What's that supposed to mean?

4442
03:22:20,300 --> 03:22:21,420
What's that supposed to mean?

4443
03:22:21,440 --> 03:22:22,500
That I've never heard before.

4444
03:22:22,680 --> 03:22:23,560
These are so funny.

4445
03:22:24,440 --> 03:22:25,480
That's wrong.

4446
03:22:27,940 --> 03:22:30,440
Ryden is such a little baby.

4447
03:22:30,740 --> 03:22:32,100
I love him so much.

4448
03:22:32,920 --> 03:22:34,000
That's wrong.

4449
03:22:36,480 --> 03:22:37,160
Okay.

4450
03:22:38,020 --> 03:22:40,040
We gotta go to the core.

4451
03:22:44,020 --> 03:22:45,740
Which let's just...

4452
03:22:50,620 --> 03:22:52,120
There's that guy right there.

4453
03:22:52,380 --> 03:22:53,620
Does he look this way?

4454
03:22:54,000 --> 03:22:55,080
I don't remember.

4455
03:22:55,600 --> 03:22:56,280
Let's just run for it.

4456
03:22:58,880 --> 03:22:59,400
Alright.

4457
03:23:01,840 --> 03:23:03,000
Let's go into the core.

4458
03:23:04,440 --> 03:23:05,760
Like a good soldier.

4459
03:23:05,920 --> 03:23:06,580
Safe armies.

4460
03:23:13,050 --> 03:23:14,090
Anybody here?

4461
03:23:15,170 --> 03:23:16,150
Nothing here.

4462
03:23:17,830 --> 03:23:18,470
Oh wait.

4463
03:23:18,530 --> 03:23:19,190
Not sensor A.

4464
03:23:19,690 --> 03:23:20,830
Mind D.

4465
03:23:27,690 --> 03:23:28,210
Um.

4466
03:23:30,170 --> 03:23:30,950
Oh my gosh.

4467
03:23:30,950 --> 03:23:32,130
There is something over there.

4468
03:23:33,890 --> 03:23:34,650
Oh my god.

4469
03:23:34,750 --> 03:23:34,990
Wait.

4470
03:23:35,070 --> 03:23:35,490
Where did it...

4471
03:23:35,490 --> 03:23:36,630
Where did that come from?

4472
03:23:42,160 --> 03:23:42,780
Aye aye.

4473
03:23:43,580 --> 03:23:44,040
Oh.

4474
03:23:46,800 --> 03:23:47,540
Oh my gosh.

4475
03:23:47,600 --> 03:23:47,960
Please.

4476
03:23:51,060 --> 03:23:51,520
Really?

4477
03:24:02,230 --> 03:24:03,190
Oh my gosh.

4478
03:24:03,850 --> 03:24:05,250
These little bastards.

4479
03:24:06,650 --> 03:24:07,110
Oh.

4480
03:24:09,130 --> 03:24:09,730
Come on.

4481
03:24:10,050 --> 03:24:10,890
Kill it.

4482
03:24:10,930 --> 03:24:11,290
There we go.

4483
03:24:17,860 --> 03:24:18,720
There we go.

4484
03:24:19,180 --> 03:24:20,180
And one more.

4485
03:24:33,550 --> 03:24:34,870
I hate these guys.

4486
03:24:36,470 --> 03:24:37,330
Low ammo?

4487
03:24:37,730 --> 03:24:38,270
No.

4488
03:24:44,280 --> 03:24:45,160
Reload Raiden.

4489
03:24:46,080 --> 03:24:46,780
Oh wait.

4490
03:24:46,860 --> 03:24:47,740
Is that all I have left?

4491
03:24:48,320 --> 03:24:49,180
There's no way.

4492
03:24:49,680 --> 03:24:51,100
Is that all I have left?

4493
03:24:51,100 --> 03:24:51,940
Oh shoot.

4494
03:25:00,300 --> 03:25:02,240
How do I have such few left?

4495
03:25:04,280 --> 03:25:05,060
Oh gosh.

4496
03:25:05,080 --> 03:25:06,540
I have to be really careful then.

4497
03:25:08,340 --> 03:25:10,560
How am I not hitting it though?

4498
03:25:11,160 --> 03:25:11,440
How am I not hitting it though?

4499
03:25:16,010 --> 03:25:16,570
How am I not hitting it though?

4500
03:25:16,590 --> 03:25:16,750
Um.

4501
03:25:17,570 --> 03:25:18,930
Fat man hit them all.

4502
03:25:19,130 --> 03:25:19,430
No!

4503
03:25:21,310 --> 03:25:22,650
You guys, I think I'm in trouble.

4504
03:25:24,670 --> 03:25:25,130
Chaff?

4505
03:25:25,450 --> 03:25:26,290
You're so right.

4506
03:25:26,590 --> 03:25:27,230
Thank you.

4507
03:25:27,410 --> 03:25:29,010
I forgot I could use the chaff on these.

4508
03:25:33,790 --> 03:25:34,550
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

4509
03:25:36,770 --> 03:25:37,250
Beep,

4510
03:25:43,710 --> 03:25:43,710
beep, beep, beep.

4511
03:25:43,750 --> 03:25:45,450
And here I gotta run for it.

4512
03:25:45,530 --> 03:25:46,130
Cause they all...

4513
03:25:46,130 --> 03:25:46,270
Yeah!

4514
03:25:50,190 --> 03:25:51,150
More guns!

4515
03:25:51,410 --> 03:25:51,890
No!

4516
03:25:51,990 --> 03:25:53,210
I need the AK first!

4517
03:25:55,350 --> 03:25:55,830
No!

4518
03:25:57,110 --> 03:25:58,570
I need the AK first.

4519
03:25:58,850 --> 03:25:59,670
Where's my outfit?

4520
03:26:02,210 --> 03:26:02,890
There it is.

4521
03:26:04,250 --> 03:26:04,730
Okay.

4522
03:26:04,790 --> 03:26:05,650
Looking fancy.

4523
03:26:06,010 --> 03:26:06,670
There we go.

4524
03:26:09,690 --> 03:26:11,110
Oh, strut up for the AK!

4525
03:26:11,430 --> 03:26:12,270
Oh shoot, you're right.

4526
03:26:14,710 --> 03:26:15,190
Oh.

4527
03:26:15,370 --> 03:26:16,090
One second.

4528
03:26:17,930 --> 03:26:19,250
Got a minute, Jack?

4529
03:26:19,490 --> 03:26:19,650
No!

4530
03:26:19,910 --> 03:26:20,610
I don't!

4531
03:26:20,630 --> 03:26:23,710
I found some information on where Solid Snake is interred.

4532
03:26:23,870 --> 03:26:24,350
Great.

4533
03:26:24,590 --> 03:26:24,950
Shoot.

4534
03:26:25,190 --> 03:26:26,750
I've located the grave site.

4535
03:26:26,970 --> 03:26:27,770
And the body?

4536
03:26:27,910 --> 03:26:29,570
It's zoomed for DNA testing.

4537
03:26:30,150 --> 03:26:31,610
Do you have the results?

4538
03:26:31,870 --> 03:26:34,870
The right arm was missing, but there was no doubt that it was him.

4539
03:26:34,870 --> 03:26:37,170
That body belongs to Solid Snake.

4540
03:26:37,270 --> 03:26:38,110
Why was his arm missing?

4541
03:26:38,950 --> 03:26:41,270
So the head of the terrorist group must be...

4542
03:26:41,270 --> 03:26:42,210
An impostor.

4543
03:26:42,230 --> 03:26:43,070
An impostor?

4544
03:26:43,270 --> 03:26:44,430
You sound disappointed.

4545
03:26:44,450 --> 03:26:49,070
I guess I was kind of hoping to meet the legend in the flesh.

4546
03:26:49,290 --> 03:26:50,170
I get you.

4547
03:26:50,250 --> 03:26:52,410
But it looks like he's not behind this incident.

4548
03:26:53,010 --> 03:26:53,530
Raiden.

4549
03:26:53,870 --> 03:26:55,450
The President needs you, I think.

4550
03:26:56,090 --> 03:26:57,850
Disguise yourself as enemy personnel.

4551
03:26:58,090 --> 03:26:59,950
And infiltrate the core section.

4552
03:27:00,310 --> 03:27:03,930
Your priority is to contact Agent Ames.

4553
03:27:04,210 --> 03:27:04,850
Agent Ames?

4554
03:27:04,870 --> 03:27:05,830
Agent Ames...

4555
03:27:06,550 --> 03:27:07,810
Okay, I gotta leave.

4556
03:27:09,390 --> 03:27:10,050
Dang it.

4557
03:27:12,230 --> 03:27:13,810
I forgot that I need to get the AK.

4558
03:27:14,030 --> 03:27:17,050
Okay, we have keycard 2.

4559
03:27:18,410 --> 03:27:20,210
Woah, look at all them birds.

4560
03:27:27,310 --> 03:27:29,070
Oh my gosh, we have that guy up there.

4561
03:27:29,550 --> 03:27:30,410
I'll take him out.

4562
03:27:41,890 --> 03:27:44,370
Came for the old and janky, stayed for the cute ghost.

4563
03:27:48,450 --> 03:27:48,610
Yes.

4564
03:27:49,030 --> 03:27:49,430
How?

4565
03:27:49,570 --> 03:27:49,790
Okay.

4566
03:27:51,210 --> 03:27:53,510
Where is the best place to shoot these things?

4567
03:27:53,630 --> 03:27:54,630
Cause I feel like I'm all...

4568
03:27:54,630 --> 03:27:56,750
It's the little gun down here, right?

4569
03:27:59,610 --> 03:28:01,550
I'm gonna run out of bullets at this rate.

4570
03:28:01,910 --> 03:28:02,290
Ah!

4571
03:28:08,720 --> 03:28:09,380
It's lower?

4572
03:28:12,500 --> 03:28:14,140
The gun is one shot kill but it's fin...

4573
03:28:14,140 --> 03:28:15,560
Yeah, I know, it's like hard.

4574
03:28:16,640 --> 03:28:17,720
Now they're all here.

4575
03:28:17,720 --> 03:28:18,600
These little...

4576
03:28:18,600 --> 03:28:20,060
I hate these guys.

4577
03:28:21,340 --> 03:28:23,200
I'm gonna have to chaff again, clearly.

4578
03:28:23,480 --> 03:28:25,480
But I just wanted to see how to get through them.

4579
03:28:27,800 --> 03:28:29,720
I'm wondering if I should just...

4580
03:28:36,180 --> 03:28:37,860
I'm wondering if I should just...

4581
03:28:47,920 --> 03:28:48,800
Okay, wait.

4582
03:28:49,500 --> 03:28:50,280
How do I...

4583
03:28:50,280 --> 03:28:51,320
Oh gosh.

4584
03:28:58,480 --> 03:29:00,120
I didn't realize how far I was.

4585
03:29:00,120 --> 03:29:01,080
What's going on?

4586
03:29:01,900 --> 03:29:02,380
Raiden!

4587
03:29:03,900 --> 03:29:04,380
Raiden!

4588
03:29:06,980 --> 03:29:09,860
Aim for the top of the site, not the tip.

4589
03:29:10,740 --> 03:29:11,540
Okay, okay.

4590
03:29:12,440 --> 03:29:13,320
I'll try again.

4591
03:29:15,960 --> 03:29:17,880
Or rather, I'm not gonna try right now.

4592
03:29:18,220 --> 03:29:19,600
But I will try.

4593
03:29:20,220 --> 03:29:21,960
Okay, how do I...

4594
03:29:22,760 --> 03:29:23,780
get through this?

4595
03:29:24,100 --> 03:29:25,400
Oh, I think on the other side...

4596
03:29:25,400 --> 03:29:26,300
Okay, I know how to get through this.

4597
03:29:26,660 --> 03:29:27,140
Phew!

4598
03:29:35,230 --> 03:29:35,390
God!

4599
03:29:55,070 --> 03:29:56,650
Maybe I should just reload.

4600
03:29:57,250 --> 03:29:58,190
Nah, it's okay.

4601
03:30:01,950 --> 03:30:02,350
Okay.

4602
03:30:02,530 --> 03:30:03,250
Alright, Raiden.

4603
03:30:04,370 --> 03:30:05,230
Nice, nice, nice.

4604
03:30:05,410 --> 03:30:05,910
And now grip.

4605
03:30:06,410 --> 03:30:07,370
Time to grip, buddy.

4606
03:30:07,790 --> 03:30:09,190
We got that level 2 grip!

4607
03:30:09,510 --> 03:30:11,630
Oh yeah, we got that level 2 grip, baby!

4608
03:30:12,150 --> 03:30:13,530
We got that level 2 grip!

4609
03:30:13,970 --> 03:30:15,370
We got that level 2 grip!

4610
03:30:16,650 --> 03:30:18,450
We're gonna keep going and we're not gonna stop.

4611
03:30:18,650 --> 03:30:19,310
Oh, wait.

4612
03:30:19,490 --> 03:30:22,230
Oh gosh, wait.

4613
03:30:22,550 --> 03:30:24,950
The trap is going down way faster than I thought it would.

4614
03:30:25,110 --> 03:30:25,610
Wait, wait, wait.

4615
03:30:25,750 --> 03:30:27,370
Raiden, Raiden, we gotta...

4616
03:30:27,750 --> 03:30:28,530
Raiden, we gotta go.

4617
03:30:29,410 --> 03:30:29,770
Ah!

4618
03:30:32,730 --> 03:30:33,150
Let's go!

4619
03:30:35,090 --> 03:30:36,170
Oh my god, it's the guy!

4620
03:30:36,490 --> 03:30:37,650
It was the guy up there!

4621
03:30:42,480 --> 03:30:42,840
Um...

4622
03:30:43,960 --> 03:30:44,920
I think we're in trouble.

4623
03:31:15,020 --> 03:31:15,560
Everything's fine!

4624
03:31:17,500 --> 03:31:18,380
Everything's fine!

4625
03:31:19,940 --> 03:31:22,180
I didn't know he was standing right there.

4626
03:31:22,500 --> 03:31:22,520
I didn't know he was standing right there.

4627
03:31:26,200 --> 03:31:27,440
Get outta here!

4628
03:31:30,140 --> 03:31:32,760
Yeah, return to your positions, dummies.

4629
03:31:33,360 --> 03:31:35,120
Yeah, return to your positions, dummies.

4630
03:31:44,840 --> 03:31:47,740
This game always gets me.

4631
03:31:47,920 --> 03:31:48,160
This game always gets me.

4632
03:31:50,180 --> 03:31:53,100
Should I just wait out the caution before I go in there?

4633
03:31:53,360 --> 03:31:53,880
Should I just wait out the caution before I go in there?

4634
03:31:53,880 --> 03:31:54,780
I do have stun grenades.

4635
03:31:55,660 --> 03:31:56,180
I do have stun grenades.

4636
03:32:07,600 --> 03:32:08,120
Okay.

4637
03:32:10,080 --> 03:32:10,600
Question...

4638
03:32:11,360 --> 03:32:12,800
Is the AK...

4639
03:32:13,560 --> 03:32:15,380
on the top floor or the bottom floor?

4640
03:32:15,980 --> 03:32:16,500
On the top floor or the bottom floor?

4641
03:32:16,500 --> 03:32:17,420
You guys wanna...

4642
03:32:18,320 --> 03:32:19,620
Well, you know...

4643
03:32:20,900 --> 03:32:23,720
If you guys wanna help out a little bit...

4644
03:32:23,720 --> 03:32:23,740
If you guys wanna help out a little bit...

4645
03:32:23,740 --> 03:32:25,960
The bottom...

4646
03:32:27,320 --> 03:32:28,960
Bottom... The bottom...

4647
03:32:28,980 --> 03:32:29,840
The bottom?

4648
03:32:30,220 --> 03:32:30,980
The bottom?

4649
03:32:41,420 --> 03:32:44,200
If I die here, I'm just gonna reload the save.

4650
03:32:44,760 --> 03:32:46,160
I'm gonna go to the main venue.

4651
03:32:46,520 --> 03:32:47,320
And reload!

4652
03:32:48,720 --> 03:32:49,420
Oh my god.

4653
03:32:51,420 --> 03:32:51,940
Okay.

4654
03:32:52,180 --> 03:32:52,960
The button.

4655
03:33:10,880 --> 03:33:11,920
Nothing here.

4656
03:33:16,620 --> 03:33:17,680
Which way do you go?

4657
03:33:17,780 --> 03:33:18,320
Up or down?

4658
03:33:23,620 --> 03:33:24,340
We're dancing?

4659
03:33:25,200 --> 03:33:25,960
Don't turn around.

4660
03:33:26,540 --> 03:33:27,220
Keep going.

4661
03:33:27,440 --> 03:33:27,460
Oh!

4662
03:33:29,400 --> 03:33:29,840
Uh...

4663
03:33:32,180 --> 03:33:33,180
Is this it?

4664
03:33:34,100 --> 03:33:34,540
Yes.

4665
03:33:34,820 --> 03:33:35,600
I got it.

4666
03:33:36,480 --> 03:33:37,100
We're good.

4667
03:33:38,240 --> 03:33:39,000
Don't... dang it.

4668
03:33:44,500 --> 03:33:45,120
We're fine.

4669
03:33:47,340 --> 03:33:48,000
Where's the AK?

4670
03:33:48,700 --> 03:33:49,800
Let's get the AK first.

4671
03:33:50,040 --> 03:33:50,540
Where is it?

4672
03:33:50,880 --> 03:33:51,600
Where's the AK?

4673
03:33:51,740 --> 03:33:52,280
Where's the AK?

4674
03:33:53,100 --> 03:33:53,800
Where's the AK?

4675
03:33:58,870 --> 03:33:59,910
Are you kidding me?

4676
03:33:59,990 --> 03:34:00,610
Get out of here.

4677
03:34:01,070 --> 03:34:02,710
Who said you could come in here?

4678
03:34:03,670 --> 03:34:04,150
God.

4679
03:34:05,850 --> 03:34:06,510
Where's the AK?

4680
03:34:07,130 --> 03:34:08,070
Oh, there it is.

4681
03:34:08,570 --> 03:34:09,050
Yippee!

4682
03:34:11,110 --> 03:34:12,490
I could have... I was like...

4683
03:34:12,490 --> 03:34:15,090
I just hovered... I was just under the radar.

4684
03:34:16,150 --> 03:34:17,070
An AK.

4685
03:34:20,830 --> 03:34:21,790
I can!

4686
03:34:22,910 --> 03:34:23,350
I can!

4687
03:34:27,010 --> 03:34:29,750
Guards in Shell 1's core are armed with AK rifles.

4688
03:34:29,830 --> 03:34:30,870
Why is it like that?

4689
03:34:31,010 --> 03:34:32,650
Others are armed with the AN-94.

4690
03:34:32,770 --> 03:34:33,170
What?

4691
03:34:33,170 --> 03:34:33,890
The official rifle of the Russian Army.

4692
03:34:33,890 --> 03:34:35,830
Yeah, but what if I... what if I'm just taking a walk?

4693
03:34:36,030 --> 03:34:37,310
If you hope to disguise yourself as the enemy...

4694
03:34:37,310 --> 03:34:39,930
I'm just taking a walk from the... from the... from the core.

4695
03:34:40,350 --> 03:34:40,710
You don't want to be carrying an AK outside of Shell 1's core.

4696
03:34:41,690 --> 03:34:43,690
Who cares if I have one or not?

4697
03:34:43,870 --> 03:34:44,730
Who cares?

4698
03:34:46,070 --> 03:34:47,390
Oh, more bullets.

4699
03:34:47,830 --> 03:34:48,610
Oh, delicious.

4700
03:34:48,790 --> 03:34:49,210
Yum yum yum.

4701
03:34:49,230 --> 03:34:50,850
Get the M4 first.

4702
03:34:50,930 --> 03:34:51,230
Okay.

4703
03:34:52,310 --> 03:34:52,710
Okay.

4704
03:34:53,270 --> 03:34:55,210
They're just being all sorts of picky now.

4705
03:35:03,330 --> 03:35:04,950
No, let's not leave through there.

4706
03:35:08,070 --> 03:35:09,470
The enemy cares.

4707
03:35:10,370 --> 03:35:13,650
They care... they're just a little too anal about it, I think.

4708
03:35:15,250 --> 03:35:17,750
They're just a little too like...

4709
03:35:17,750 --> 03:35:18,250
Come on.

4710
03:35:18,390 --> 03:35:19,170
It's fine.

4711
03:35:19,670 --> 03:35:20,570
No, like it's whatever.

4712
03:35:21,650 --> 03:35:22,990
Okay, this guy...

4713
03:35:22,990 --> 03:35:24,630
It's gonna be a bit of a pain.

4714
03:35:24,830 --> 03:35:25,350
No!

4715
03:35:25,530 --> 03:35:26,310
Don't come over here!

4716
03:35:36,960 --> 03:35:37,980
Nothing here.

4717
03:35:42,760 --> 03:35:43,340
Hey!

4718
03:35:48,320 --> 03:35:51,140
But now the bridge is all messed up, isn't it?

4719
03:35:55,740 --> 03:35:57,840
Now the bridge is all messed up though.

4720
03:35:59,540 --> 03:36:00,360
This guy.

4721
03:36:00,660 --> 03:36:01,880
You bastard.

4722
03:36:05,380 --> 03:36:05,960
Oh!

4723
03:36:09,720 --> 03:36:10,960
We got a few more.

4724
03:36:12,720 --> 03:36:13,460
Oh my god.

4725
03:36:17,120 --> 03:36:18,100
How's your ammo looking?

4726
03:36:18,240 --> 03:36:18,820
Not great.

4727
03:36:20,820 --> 03:36:22,660
Not great, I'll be honest.

4728
03:36:24,380 --> 03:36:25,780
Okay, so aim for the...

4729
03:36:27,240 --> 03:36:28,640
What should I be aiming for?

4730
03:36:31,360 --> 03:36:32,420
Like lower here?

4731
03:36:33,640 --> 03:36:34,340
Like here?

4732
03:36:34,820 --> 03:36:35,500
Oh my god.

4733
03:36:36,660 --> 03:36:37,100
No!

4734
03:36:37,240 --> 03:36:37,880
I shot one!

4735
03:36:38,100 --> 03:36:38,200
Again!

4736
03:36:46,640 --> 03:36:47,600
Spray and pray with the AK.

4737
03:36:56,440 --> 03:36:57,200
Oh my god.

4738
03:36:57,280 --> 03:36:57,620
Oh my god.

4739
03:36:57,700 --> 03:36:58,680
No, I didn't mean to do that.

4740
03:37:05,220 --> 03:37:06,120
Why did you have to move?

4741
03:37:06,960 --> 03:37:07,760
Right at that moment.

4742
03:37:09,960 --> 03:37:10,420
There we go.

4743
03:37:11,260 --> 03:37:11,540
Okay.

4744
03:37:12,740 --> 03:37:13,320
Where's the other one?

4745
03:37:13,440 --> 03:37:13,500
Oh.

4746
03:37:14,720 --> 03:37:15,280
My bullets.

4747
03:37:21,550 --> 03:37:22,070
Please.

4748
03:37:22,530 --> 03:37:23,050
Brydon.

4749
03:37:26,110 --> 03:37:26,630
Okay.

4750
03:37:28,110 --> 03:37:29,730
As long as that guy doesn't wake up.

4751
03:37:30,390 --> 03:37:31,610
I think we're okay though.

4752
03:37:31,810 --> 03:37:32,890
I think we're mostly okay.

4753
03:37:33,950 --> 03:37:34,990
Oh geez.

4754
03:37:36,310 --> 03:37:38,410
What a troublesome spot we're in, everybody.

4755
03:37:41,810 --> 03:37:44,030
A bit of an annoyance here.

4756
03:37:44,850 --> 03:37:46,790
A bit of a troublesome spot.

4757
03:37:47,510 --> 03:37:48,430
But it's okay.

4758
03:37:50,070 --> 03:37:51,510
We need more bullets.

4759
03:37:51,750 --> 03:37:52,090
I know.

4760
03:37:53,610 --> 03:37:54,510
We'll get them.

4761
03:37:55,150 --> 03:37:55,630
Somewhere.

4762
03:37:56,750 --> 03:37:57,830
They have to keep the...

4763
03:37:57,830 --> 03:38:01,310
If everybody in Shell 1 uses the bullets, then we also need to use the bullets.

4764
03:38:01,890 --> 03:38:02,450
Oh gosh.

4765
03:38:02,530 --> 03:38:03,170
I'm scared here.

4766
03:38:03,450 --> 03:38:04,310
Oh gosh.

4767
03:38:04,850 --> 03:38:05,710
Oh gosh.

4768
03:38:05,830 --> 03:38:06,930
I hope they don't spot me.

4769
03:38:08,030 --> 03:38:08,270
Fight.

4770
03:38:09,310 --> 03:38:09,790
Ah!

4771
03:38:18,930 --> 03:38:20,650
That sounded a little personal.

4772
03:38:20,870 --> 03:38:21,410
The way he's saying it.

4773
03:38:21,410 --> 03:38:23,110
The way Snake said that sounded personal.

4774
03:38:23,450 --> 03:38:24,550
And being just like...

4775
03:38:24,550 --> 03:38:25,450
Brydon!

4776
03:38:26,070 --> 03:38:26,550
Like...

4777
03:38:27,310 --> 03:38:27,790
Brydon!

4778
03:38:28,310 --> 03:38:28,790
Brydon!

4779
03:38:30,130 --> 03:38:31,770
Oh, first we gotta take out this guy.

4780
03:38:33,470 --> 03:38:34,530
At the tippy top.

4781
03:38:35,270 --> 03:38:36,010
There he is.

4782
03:38:38,350 --> 03:38:39,670
First we take out this guy.

4783
03:38:43,070 --> 03:38:43,550
Okay.

4784
03:38:44,210 --> 03:38:44,690
Now...

4785
03:38:44,690 --> 03:38:45,430
AK.

4786
03:38:51,370 --> 03:38:52,670
I think I can get it from here.

4787
03:38:56,030 --> 03:38:56,730
I'm like...

4788
03:38:56,730 --> 03:38:57,010
I'm like...

4789
03:38:57,010 --> 03:38:58,010
I can't aim lower.

4790
03:38:58,810 --> 03:39:00,190
So I'm not gonna try.

4791
03:39:00,710 --> 03:39:01,230
But...

4792
03:39:01,230 --> 03:39:01,970
This one's coming.

4793
03:39:04,610 --> 03:39:05,130
Nice.

4794
03:39:09,190 --> 03:39:11,910
And once this one goes away...

4795
03:39:15,470 --> 03:39:16,510
Thank you!

4796
03:39:17,190 --> 03:39:18,530
I like to think Brydon...

4797
03:39:19,230 --> 03:39:20,090
Is Wawa?

4798
03:39:20,250 --> 03:39:20,950
Wait, where'd it go?

4799
03:39:23,490 --> 03:39:24,210
Oh my god.

4800
03:39:24,690 --> 03:39:25,210
Oh!

4801
03:39:25,650 --> 03:39:26,750
That was so close!

4802
03:39:26,850 --> 03:39:26,990
Oh!

4803
03:39:28,550 --> 03:39:29,030
Hold on.

4804
03:39:29,210 --> 03:39:29,590
Oh!

4805
03:39:29,930 --> 03:39:30,330
No!

4806
03:39:30,510 --> 03:39:31,450
I missed my shot.

4807
03:39:32,290 --> 03:39:32,790
It's okay.

4808
03:39:32,870 --> 03:39:33,770
I can take out this one though.

4809
03:39:34,890 --> 03:39:35,290
Oh!

4810
03:39:35,550 --> 03:39:36,230
Too high.

4811
03:39:38,710 --> 03:39:39,110
Nice.

4812
03:39:40,930 --> 03:39:41,730
And this one.

4813
03:39:43,270 --> 03:39:43,670
Don't...

4814
03:39:43,670 --> 03:39:44,690
Don't notice me, please.

4815
03:39:47,370 --> 03:39:47,930
Got him.

4816
03:39:48,030 --> 03:39:48,350
Okay!

4817
03:39:50,510 --> 03:39:52,150
I like to think Brydon isn't injured.

4818
03:39:52,230 --> 03:39:53,230
He's just floating there.

4819
03:39:53,370 --> 03:39:53,770
Embarrassed.

4820
03:39:53,770 --> 03:39:53,890
Like...

4821
03:39:53,890 --> 03:39:54,190
Damn.

4822
03:39:54,350 --> 03:39:54,850
I f'ed up.

4823
03:39:55,950 --> 03:39:56,350
Okay!

4824
03:39:57,010 --> 03:39:59,210
That was truly my thought process, yes.

4825
03:40:00,410 --> 03:40:00,970
Okay.

4826
03:40:03,410 --> 03:40:04,310
There we go.

4827
03:40:05,330 --> 03:40:06,870
I don't think he's dead either.

4828
03:40:06,950 --> 03:40:09,370
He really just looks like he's kind of... sad.

4829
03:40:11,850 --> 03:40:15,210
But it does look kind of like... pretty far, maybe.

4830
03:40:15,370 --> 03:40:15,710
You know?

4831
03:40:19,530 --> 03:40:21,590
I love having level 2 grip!

4832
03:40:22,350 --> 03:40:24,950
I love having level 2 grip!

4833
03:40:25,750 --> 03:40:28,310
I love having level 2 grip!

4834
03:40:28,570 --> 03:40:28,770
Grip.

4835
03:40:28,890 --> 03:40:29,130
Grip.

4836
03:40:29,250 --> 03:40:29,490
Grip.

4837
03:40:29,490 --> 03:40:29,570
Grip.

4838
03:40:29,570 --> 03:40:32,170
I love having level 2 grip!

4839
03:40:33,650 --> 03:40:34,210
Yay!

4840
03:40:34,870 --> 03:40:35,670
All right.

4841
03:40:35,790 --> 03:40:37,250
Let's get suited up, everybody!

4842
03:40:40,450 --> 03:40:41,010
NRAK!

4843
03:40:42,590 --> 03:40:43,150
Nice.

4844
03:40:43,690 --> 03:40:44,490
Here we go!

4845
03:40:47,310 --> 03:40:48,270
Get a grip!

4846
03:40:54,740 --> 03:40:57,140
So I just have to not run into these folks.

4847
03:40:59,780 --> 03:41:00,620
Don't be...

4848
03:41:00,620 --> 03:41:01,620
Suspicious.

4849
03:41:01,620 --> 03:41:02,840
Don't be suspicious.

4850
03:41:12,240 --> 03:41:14,500
Why this camera angle?

4851
03:41:14,760 --> 03:41:15,940
Don't be suspicious.

4852
03:41:17,980 --> 03:41:19,420
Don't be suspicious.

4853
03:41:19,860 --> 03:41:20,360
Yes.

4854
03:41:22,000 --> 03:41:23,460
Don't be suspicious.

4855
03:41:23,780 --> 03:41:25,080
Don't be suspicious.

4856
03:41:27,100 --> 03:41:28,240
Where is the nerd?

4857
03:41:28,240 --> 03:41:30,140
I think it's downstairs in...

4858
03:41:30,140 --> 03:41:32,260
that one room.

4859
03:41:34,090 --> 03:41:34,520
Yup.

4860
03:41:35,760 --> 03:41:37,460
I'm just a soldier.

4861
03:41:40,440 --> 03:41:41,300
Yes.

4862
03:41:41,960 --> 03:41:43,760
I'm just a soldier.

4863
03:41:48,760 --> 03:41:50,480
Thank you.

4864
03:42:03,080 --> 03:42:04,760
There is the eye sensor.

4865
03:42:08,720 --> 03:42:09,140
To enter.

4866
03:42:16,030 --> 03:42:16,750
There it is.

4867
03:42:17,970 --> 03:42:18,590
Oh well.

4868
03:42:18,610 --> 03:42:19,450
This one is for this floor.

4869
03:42:19,610 --> 03:42:19,970
Oh shoot.

4870
03:42:20,090 --> 03:42:20,250
Wait.

4871
03:42:20,290 --> 03:42:20,870
Where is the other one?

4872
03:42:21,890 --> 03:42:22,930
Ryan do be like...

4873
03:42:22,930 --> 03:42:24,610
I do love the whiskey.

4874
03:42:24,790 --> 03:42:25,470
Or vodka.

4875
03:42:27,710 --> 03:42:28,150
Yup.

4876
03:42:29,790 --> 03:42:30,750
Don't be suspicious.

4877
03:42:32,110 --> 03:42:33,090
Don't be suspicious.

4878
03:42:35,550 --> 03:42:36,210
Eat that.

4879
03:42:36,730 --> 03:42:38,010
But not being... Oh.

4880
03:42:38,030 --> 03:42:38,210
Ryan.

4881
03:42:38,350 --> 03:42:39,290
Ryan in your uniform.

4882
03:42:41,910 --> 03:42:42,350
Hahaha.

4883
03:42:42,350 --> 03:42:42,790
Wait.

4884
03:42:42,970 --> 03:42:43,650
Where is it?

4885
03:42:45,150 --> 03:42:45,590
Oh.

4886
03:42:45,630 --> 03:42:45,970
There it is.

4887
03:42:47,850 --> 03:42:48,910
Don't be suspicious.

4888
03:42:50,470 --> 03:42:52,010
Not suspicious at all.

4889
03:42:52,150 --> 03:42:52,290
Wait.

4890
03:42:52,350 --> 03:42:52,910
Let's go back up.

4891
03:42:52,970 --> 03:42:53,910
And find the nerd there.

4892
03:43:01,960 --> 03:43:03,380
I'm going in the elevator.

4893
03:43:03,760 --> 03:43:04,920
I have very important business.

4894
03:43:06,320 --> 03:43:06,760
Yeah.

4895
03:43:06,780 --> 03:43:07,480
We gotta find the nerd.

4896
03:43:08,500 --> 03:43:10,160
And don't say the bottom right.

4897
03:43:10,980 --> 03:43:11,420
Two.

4898
03:43:15,180 --> 03:43:17,100
I didn't play MGS when it came out.

4899
03:43:17,160 --> 03:43:17,780
By any means.

4900
03:43:17,900 --> 03:43:18,680
So I was a bit surprised.

4901
03:43:18,760 --> 03:43:20,660
That apparently people were not that fond of Ryan.

4902
03:43:20,680 --> 03:43:21,360
And as a protagonist.

4903
03:43:21,520 --> 03:43:23,620
And it kind of reminded me of how people didn't like Gohan in DBZ.

4904
03:43:23,760 --> 03:43:24,880
Or Nero in DMC.

4905
03:43:25,000 --> 03:43:25,980
Kind of funny how that happens.

4906
03:43:26,500 --> 03:43:26,900
Right.

4907
03:43:28,680 --> 03:43:30,280
It is kind of funny how that happens.

4908
03:43:31,080 --> 03:43:31,420
Um.

4909
03:43:32,480 --> 03:43:32,880
Wait.

4910
03:43:33,840 --> 03:43:34,740
Don't be suspicious.

4911
03:43:35,540 --> 03:43:36,440
Don't be suspicious.

4912
03:43:39,080 --> 03:43:40,460
Where is the nerd?

4913
03:43:41,220 --> 03:43:42,060
Where is the nerd?

4914
03:43:42,300 --> 03:43:43,060
Where is the nerd?

4915
03:43:44,620 --> 03:43:45,020
Nerdy.

4916
03:43:45,720 --> 03:43:46,120
Nerd.

4917
03:43:46,760 --> 03:43:47,400
Nerding out.

4918
03:43:47,520 --> 03:43:48,220
I'm nerding out.

4919
03:43:48,760 --> 03:43:49,940
Where is the nerd?

4920
03:43:50,300 --> 03:43:50,880
There it is.

4921
03:43:54,460 --> 03:43:56,220
Don't forget to say nothing here.

4922
03:43:56,320 --> 03:43:57,380
Every five seconds.

4923
03:43:59,260 --> 03:44:00,620
Nothing here.

4924
03:44:13,830 --> 03:44:14,730
Did they come in here?

4925
03:44:15,630 --> 03:44:16,590
I don't think so.

4926
03:44:18,410 --> 03:44:19,430
Who is that?

4927
03:44:20,870 --> 03:44:21,550
Yeah.

4928
03:44:21,630 --> 03:44:22,090
I'll take that.

4929
03:44:23,210 --> 03:44:24,630
Ooh la la.

4930
03:44:24,970 --> 03:44:25,730
My weapon.

4931
03:44:26,630 --> 03:44:27,430
Oh my god.

4932
03:44:27,470 --> 03:44:28,070
There's a cat.

4933
03:44:30,190 --> 03:44:31,430
There's a little baby.

4934
03:44:33,250 --> 03:44:35,030
Whose locker is this?

4935
03:44:37,770 --> 03:44:38,330
Okay.

4936
03:44:38,810 --> 03:44:40,630
Let's go this way since there's less people.

4937
03:44:44,580 --> 03:44:46,280
But you come down here.

4938
03:44:46,380 --> 03:44:47,000
It makes me scared.

4939
03:44:49,740 --> 03:44:50,760
Don't be suspicious.

4940
03:44:52,780 --> 03:44:54,140
Don't be suspicious.

4941
03:44:54,340 --> 03:44:55,460
What's on B2?

4942
03:44:55,640 --> 03:44:56,680
I don't remember actually.

4943
03:44:58,060 --> 03:44:58,700
Uh.

4944
03:44:58,800 --> 03:44:59,100
B...

4945
03:45:03,390 --> 03:45:05,230
Remember what you're fighting for.

4946
03:45:05,350 --> 03:45:08,050
Remember who's waiting for you at home.

4947
03:45:08,930 --> 03:45:10,170
Second floor basement.

4948
03:45:12,130 --> 03:45:12,770
B2.

4949
03:45:14,950 --> 03:45:16,210
I like B1 though.

4950
03:45:17,670 --> 03:45:18,310
Wait.

4951
03:45:18,310 --> 03:45:18,930
Computer room.

4952
03:45:19,050 --> 03:45:19,470
Wait a second.

4953
03:45:19,690 --> 03:45:20,490
Or maybe...

4954
03:45:20,490 --> 03:45:21,230
Oh wait.

4955
03:45:21,330 --> 03:45:22,690
B2 I think is where...

4956
03:45:22,690 --> 03:45:23,750
I'm thinking of.

4957
03:45:24,590 --> 03:45:26,790
A certain friend is in here I think.

4958
03:45:27,790 --> 03:45:28,430
Maybe?

4959
03:45:36,250 --> 03:45:36,770
Wait.

4960
03:45:36,830 --> 03:45:37,250
Where am I?

4961
03:45:38,390 --> 03:45:38,910
No.

4962
03:45:39,110 --> 03:45:40,310
It is B1 isn't it?

4963
03:45:40,450 --> 03:45:40,910
No.

4964
03:45:40,950 --> 03:45:41,170
It's...

4965
03:45:41,170 --> 03:45:43,710
Oh yeah.

4966
03:45:43,770 --> 03:45:44,150
Here we are.

4967
03:45:49,860 --> 03:45:50,500
What's up?

4968
03:46:01,400 --> 03:46:02,580
Venus and cancer.

4969
03:46:05,440 --> 03:46:06,480
Who's saying all that?

4970
03:46:06,900 --> 03:46:07,500
What's up?

4971
03:46:13,840 --> 03:46:14,640
Good morning.

4972
03:46:16,260 --> 03:46:17,700
Look at that bird.

4973
03:46:19,440 --> 03:46:20,360
Good morning.

4974
03:46:20,460 --> 03:46:20,980
Good morning.

4975
03:46:21,360 --> 03:46:21,780
Good morning.

4976
03:46:22,500 --> 03:46:23,120
Good morning.

4977
03:46:24,540 --> 03:46:25,560
Venus and cancer.

4978
03:46:29,340 --> 03:46:30,180
Please not!

4979
03:46:35,760 --> 03:46:37,500
Why is it showing me this guy?

4980
03:46:37,760 --> 03:46:38,220
Oh my god.

4981
03:46:39,440 --> 03:46:40,280
Can I help you?

4982
03:46:40,980 --> 03:46:41,880
Why are you running?

4983
03:46:43,000 --> 03:46:44,340
Why are you running after me?

4984
03:46:49,790 --> 03:46:50,530
Oh my god.

4985
03:46:50,610 --> 03:46:51,130
Oh my god.

4986
03:46:51,210 --> 03:46:51,970
Oh my god.

4987
03:46:57,530 --> 03:46:59,870
Why are we showing the guards fighting?

4988
03:47:00,670 --> 03:47:01,190
How?

4989
03:47:01,370 --> 03:47:01,890
How?

4990
03:47:03,070 --> 03:47:04,010
They're distracted.

4991
03:47:05,390 --> 03:47:06,170
Time to go.

4992
03:47:07,130 --> 03:47:08,370
And take their stuff.

4993
03:47:09,510 --> 03:47:10,030
Oh.

4994
03:47:10,990 --> 03:47:12,130
They were distracted.

4995
03:47:16,480 --> 03:47:17,520
Oh shoot.

4996
03:47:18,440 --> 03:47:19,880
I got the D-mic.

4997
03:47:20,000 --> 03:47:20,100
Okay.

4998
03:47:20,300 --> 03:47:20,660
Top of locker.

4999
03:47:20,920 --> 03:47:21,600
Top of locker.

5000
03:47:22,980 --> 03:47:23,500
Help.

5001
03:47:24,840 --> 03:47:26,740
You have the directional microphone.

5002
03:47:27,140 --> 03:47:30,360
According to our information, Ames has a pacemaker.

5003
03:47:30,640 --> 03:47:33,140
This should make his cardiac pattern fairly distinct.

5004
03:47:33,480 --> 03:47:35,800
Use the directional microphone to locate it.

5005
03:47:35,880 --> 03:47:36,160
Yes.

5006
03:47:36,620 --> 03:47:37,140
Okay.

5007
03:47:37,420 --> 03:47:38,820
Let me get out of here first.

5008
03:47:39,160 --> 03:47:40,640
I'm awfully scared.

5009
03:47:41,480 --> 03:47:42,680
Oh my gosh.

5010
03:47:42,700 --> 03:47:44,140
That was so close you guys.

5011
03:47:44,620 --> 03:47:46,000
Did you see how close that was?

5012
03:47:46,000 --> 03:47:48,040
I almost ran into them for real.

5013
03:47:59,460 --> 03:48:00,760
I'm trying to look in the locker.

5014
03:48:01,460 --> 03:48:02,960
But this guy is too fast.

5015
03:48:03,920 --> 03:48:05,160
He's way too fast.

5016
03:48:10,870 --> 03:48:12,370
I don't want to be suspicious or anything.

5017
03:48:12,550 --> 03:48:13,490
But I need some bullets.

5018
03:48:13,730 --> 03:48:14,030
Please.

5019
03:48:14,070 --> 03:48:14,390
Get out.

5020
03:48:17,490 --> 03:48:18,190
There's a mag...

5021
03:48:18,190 --> 03:48:18,470
Wait.

5022
03:48:18,510 --> 03:48:19,550
She said on top of the locker.

5023
03:48:20,630 --> 03:48:21,550
How do I get that?

5024
03:48:21,550 --> 03:48:21,750
But...

5025
03:48:22,910 --> 03:48:24,310
I need the M4 first.

5026
03:48:26,030 --> 03:48:26,930
How do I get that?

5027
03:48:27,630 --> 03:48:28,050
Woah.

5028
03:48:28,290 --> 03:48:28,650
Woah.

5029
03:48:30,650 --> 03:48:32,050
This is just a little hiding spot.

5030
03:48:33,070 --> 03:48:36,110
How do I get it?

5031
03:48:36,150 --> 03:48:36,650
I don't remember.

5032
03:48:37,110 --> 03:48:38,010
Do I have to punch it?

5033
03:48:41,310 --> 03:48:42,990
But they'll see me punching it, right?

5034
03:48:47,270 --> 03:48:48,590
Wait until this guy turns around.

5035
03:48:50,150 --> 03:48:50,570
Woah.

5036
03:48:50,710 --> 03:48:51,030
Woah.

5037
03:48:51,390 --> 03:48:51,810
Hey.

5038
03:48:51,910 --> 03:48:53,290
Can you like chill out?

5039
03:48:53,410 --> 03:48:53,690
Uh oh.

5040
03:48:54,070 --> 03:48:54,590
He's on his way again.

5041
03:48:55,530 --> 03:48:55,930
Wait.

5042
03:48:56,770 --> 03:48:57,910
Maybe I have time.

5043
03:48:59,550 --> 03:48:59,950
Wait.

5044
03:49:00,650 --> 03:49:01,050
Oh.

5045
03:49:01,150 --> 03:49:01,610
I don't have time.

5046
03:49:04,110 --> 03:49:05,110
He's on my butt.

5047
03:49:13,310 --> 03:49:14,230
On the PS2?

5048
03:49:14,350 --> 03:49:14,550
Yeah.

5049
03:49:15,250 --> 03:49:15,650
Damn.

5050
03:49:16,910 --> 03:49:17,530
You know what?

5051
03:49:17,570 --> 03:49:17,970
It's fine.

5052
03:49:18,270 --> 03:49:18,890
It's fine.

5053
03:49:19,030 --> 03:49:19,690
I give up.

5054
03:49:20,150 --> 03:49:20,850
I give up.

5055
03:49:23,090 --> 03:49:24,050
We got what we needed.

5056
03:49:26,490 --> 03:49:28,050
Crown guy is too scary.

5057
03:49:28,050 --> 03:49:28,850
He's too unpredictable.

5058
03:49:31,010 --> 03:49:31,490
Alrighty.

5059
03:49:32,270 --> 03:49:33,190
Good job guys!

5060
03:49:33,310 --> 03:49:33,990
Good job team!

5061
03:49:38,510 --> 03:49:39,930
The D-mic on the bird?

5062
03:49:40,450 --> 03:49:42,150
If I use it here...

5063
03:49:44,210 --> 03:49:45,470
Can I hear from... wait.

5064
03:49:47,830 --> 03:49:48,650
Where's my uniform?

5065
03:49:48,830 --> 03:49:49,110
There it is.

5066
03:49:50,030 --> 03:49:52,390
If I use it here...

5067
03:49:54,790 --> 03:49:55,570
Can I hear?

5068
03:49:55,730 --> 03:49:56,410
The bird?

5069
03:49:58,070 --> 03:49:59,550
I can hear the guy walking.

5070
03:50:01,510 --> 03:50:02,750
Rip nudie mag.

5071
03:50:04,150 --> 03:50:04,770
It's okay.

5072
03:50:05,550 --> 03:50:07,030
I have plenty of those already.

5073
03:50:09,450 --> 03:50:09,970
B1.

5074
03:50:20,870 --> 03:50:21,390
Alright.

5075
03:50:22,090 --> 03:50:23,830
This area is a little tricky.

5076
03:50:26,110 --> 03:50:27,870
This area is a little tricky.

5077
03:50:42,680 --> 03:50:43,200
Wait.

5078
03:50:43,260 --> 03:50:43,440
Hold on.

5079
03:50:43,440 --> 03:50:44,980
I gotta see his pattern real quick first.

5080
03:50:48,180 --> 03:50:48,540
Okay.

5081
03:50:48,800 --> 03:50:51,440
So he does have a second where he...

5082
03:50:53,740 --> 03:50:54,100
Um...

5083
03:50:55,360 --> 03:50:55,720
Okay.

5084
03:50:56,780 --> 03:50:57,840
And then he comes up.

5085
03:50:57,960 --> 03:50:58,220
Okay.

5086
03:51:01,660 --> 03:51:02,020
Woah.

5087
03:51:02,140 --> 03:51:02,320
Woah.

5088
03:51:02,340 --> 03:51:02,720
Why are you...

5089
03:51:02,720 --> 03:51:04,140
Why are you coming all the way over here?

5090
03:51:05,680 --> 03:51:06,040
Okay.

5091
03:51:06,120 --> 03:51:07,300
I think once he turns around...

5092
03:51:07,300 --> 03:51:07,900
I can get him though.

5093
03:51:12,520 --> 03:51:12,880
Wait.

5094
03:51:13,520 --> 03:51:13,880
Yeah.

5095
03:51:19,680 --> 03:51:20,360
What the?

5096
03:51:22,260 --> 03:51:22,860
There we go.

5097
03:51:26,750 --> 03:51:27,230
Alright.

5098
03:51:27,310 --> 03:51:27,750
Come here baby.

5099
03:51:28,410 --> 03:51:29,510
Come here little guy.

5100
03:51:30,190 --> 03:51:31,750
La la la la la la.

5101
03:51:32,590 --> 03:51:33,270
Come here.

5102
03:51:33,550 --> 03:51:35,230
Just gonna use your face.

5103
03:51:35,510 --> 03:51:36,330
For a second.

5104
03:51:39,270 --> 03:51:40,690
Oh he needs to be awake.

5105
03:51:41,330 --> 03:51:41,810
Okay.

5106
03:51:42,210 --> 03:51:43,310
I'll put him in the locker.

5107
03:51:43,830 --> 03:51:44,470
Next try.

5108
03:51:46,430 --> 03:51:47,190
He needs to...

5109
03:51:47,190 --> 03:51:47,410
Oh yeah.

5110
03:51:47,690 --> 03:51:49,090
Just open his eyes.

5111
03:51:49,130 --> 03:51:49,810
Use your fingers.

5112
03:51:50,330 --> 03:51:51,050
Just like...

5113
03:51:51,050 --> 03:51:52,670
Just like open his eyes.

5114
03:51:52,910 --> 03:51:53,490
You know?

5115
03:52:00,140 --> 03:52:00,580
Oh.

5116
03:52:00,620 --> 03:52:01,280
Wrong gun.

5117
03:52:02,900 --> 03:52:04,180
Next guy is gonna come out.

5118
03:52:04,220 --> 03:52:04,380
Right?

5119
03:52:07,620 --> 03:52:08,700
Like just use your...

5120
03:52:08,700 --> 03:52:10,520
Just pry his eyes open with your fingers.

5121
03:52:10,620 --> 03:52:11,040
It'll work.

5122
03:52:11,120 --> 03:52:11,340
Right?

5123
03:52:16,730 --> 03:52:17,170
Okay.

5124
03:52:17,410 --> 03:52:18,730
I'm so done with you.

5125
03:52:18,770 --> 03:52:19,050
Please.

5126
03:52:19,130 --> 03:52:19,910
Oh my gosh.

5127
03:52:37,970 --> 03:52:39,350
Let's see now.

5128
03:52:41,470 --> 03:52:42,890
Sorry I just had to...

5129
03:52:42,890 --> 03:52:44,310
Get rid of a...

5130
03:52:44,310 --> 03:52:45,410
Pesky fly.

5131
03:52:49,420 --> 03:52:50,100
Hello?

5132
03:52:50,700 --> 03:52:52,420
Hello fellow soldiers.

5133
03:52:53,300 --> 03:52:55,320
We're all fellow soldiers here.

5134
03:52:56,080 --> 03:52:57,700
We're all fellow soldiers.

5135
03:52:57,900 --> 03:52:58,580
We're all fellow soldiers.

5136
03:52:58,840 --> 03:53:01,540
I think I need to get that guy to come back out.

5137
03:53:02,260 --> 03:53:04,640
I think I need to...

5138
03:53:04,640 --> 03:53:06,200
I think I need to...

5139
03:53:07,340 --> 03:53:08,920
Do this part again.

5140
03:53:10,760 --> 03:53:11,760
Need the M4.

5141
03:53:14,500 --> 03:53:15,600
Swap me like a fly.

5142
03:53:16,940 --> 03:53:17,460
No.

5143
03:53:17,460 --> 03:53:18,600
It's just people like...

5144
03:53:19,120 --> 03:53:20,920
Yelling at me at the game.

5145
03:53:21,120 --> 03:53:21,880
Like I get it.

5146
03:53:22,420 --> 03:53:25,360
Sorry if I forgot some certain parts of the game.

5147
03:53:25,440 --> 03:53:25,820
You know?

5148
03:53:25,940 --> 03:53:26,500
But like...

5149
03:53:26,500 --> 03:53:28,240
You don't need to go in all caps.

5150
03:53:28,520 --> 03:53:29,540
Being like...

5151
03:53:33,000 --> 03:53:34,040
You know?

5152
03:53:34,220 --> 03:53:34,800
It's okay.

5153
03:53:35,160 --> 03:53:35,600
It's okay.

5154
03:53:37,200 --> 03:53:37,640
Knocked.

5155
03:53:37,640 --> 03:53:38,340
Oh you're so right.

5156
03:53:39,860 --> 03:53:40,300
VTuber.

5157
03:53:40,340 --> 03:53:40,680
Why?

5158
03:53:41,200 --> 03:53:42,000
Why VTuber?

5159
03:53:42,160 --> 03:53:42,580
Why?

5160
03:53:48,790 --> 03:53:49,550
Oh my gosh.

5161
03:53:49,570 --> 03:53:50,910
I didn't realize this guy comes up here.

5162
03:53:53,650 --> 03:53:54,090
VTuber.

5163
03:53:54,350 --> 03:53:55,550
Why did you forget?

5164
03:53:55,810 --> 03:53:58,110
Why did you forget to do that?

5165
03:53:58,470 --> 03:53:58,910
VTuber.

5166
03:53:59,050 --> 03:54:00,370
Why do you have your weapon out?

5167
03:54:00,470 --> 03:54:00,750
VTuber.

5168
03:54:00,990 --> 03:54:02,570
Why don't you knock instead?

5169
03:54:03,090 --> 03:54:03,530
VTuber.

5170
03:54:05,030 --> 03:54:05,470
Okay.

5171
03:54:05,470 --> 03:54:05,910
Now...

5172
03:54:06,730 --> 03:54:07,290
Let's see.

5173
03:54:07,830 --> 03:54:09,030
Actually I'm going to Kodak.

5174
03:54:09,150 --> 03:54:10,250
Because I want to see what Plissken says.

5175
03:54:12,390 --> 03:54:13,270
No response!

5176
03:54:15,410 --> 03:54:15,870
Colonel?

5177
03:54:20,170 --> 03:54:21,090
I am!

5178
03:54:23,610 --> 03:54:25,530
Colonel you're so boring in this game.

5179
03:54:32,270 --> 03:54:33,590
It's like you're soulless.

5180
03:54:34,510 --> 03:54:35,930
I thought it was an actual fly.

5181
03:54:36,010 --> 03:54:36,710
I was going to say damn.

5182
03:54:37,290 --> 03:54:38,110
It should have been me who got slapped.

5183
03:54:42,810 --> 03:54:44,510
Yeah he's just so soulless.

5184
03:54:44,510 --> 03:54:45,110
What can I do for you Jack?

5185
03:54:46,250 --> 03:54:47,570
All he cares about is the mission.

5186
03:54:47,670 --> 03:54:50,370
It's like Shadow Moses changed him or something.

5187
03:54:50,590 --> 03:54:51,690
What happened to you Colonel?

5188
03:54:52,610 --> 03:54:53,430
Ignore the Alpers.

5189
03:54:53,490 --> 03:54:54,050
No Alping.

5190
03:54:54,870 --> 03:54:55,250
No!

5191
03:54:55,490 --> 03:54:56,990
I don't mind a little bit of Alping.

5192
03:54:57,130 --> 03:54:58,170
It's just when I'm like...

5193
03:54:58,170 --> 03:55:01,410
You know trying to remember stuff and people like yell at me about it.

5194
03:55:04,910 --> 03:55:06,330
Jack how's the mission going?

5195
03:55:07,290 --> 03:55:07,890
Oh fine.

5196
03:55:08,030 --> 03:55:08,250
Fine?

5197
03:55:08,510 --> 03:55:09,170
Is that it?

5198
03:55:09,510 --> 03:55:12,130
Look I really don't feel like talking about the mission.

5199
03:55:12,330 --> 03:55:13,350
At least with you.

5200
03:55:13,650 --> 03:55:15,390
I want to talk about something else.

5201
03:55:15,650 --> 03:55:16,710
Okay then.

5202
03:55:17,170 --> 03:55:18,270
Let's talk about you.

5203
03:55:18,430 --> 03:55:18,810
Yeah.

5204
03:55:19,390 --> 03:55:21,290
Your least favorite subject.

5205
03:55:22,570 --> 03:55:23,530
Oh yeah?

5206
03:55:23,710 --> 03:55:25,010
Then go ahead and say something.

5207
03:55:25,550 --> 03:55:26,270
Like what?

5208
03:55:26,630 --> 03:55:27,110
Anything.

5209
03:55:27,530 --> 03:55:28,970
Tell me something about yourself.

5210
03:55:29,290 --> 03:55:30,010
How self-centered.

5211
03:55:30,010 --> 03:55:31,670
I can't think of anything interesting to say.

5212
03:55:31,850 --> 03:55:33,830
Why do you want to talk about me so badly?

5213
03:55:33,830 --> 03:55:35,310
Because I'm curious.

5214
03:55:35,790 --> 03:55:36,510
But why?

5215
03:55:37,010 --> 03:55:40,250
Is it really that strange to want to know more about someone you love?

5216
03:55:40,830 --> 03:55:41,730
I'm self-centered.

5217
03:55:41,890 --> 03:55:44,110
You know sometimes I...

5218
03:55:44,110 --> 03:55:45,610
Such an egotistical woman.

5219
03:55:45,670 --> 03:55:46,990
Now we're talking about me not you.

5220
03:55:48,550 --> 03:55:50,290
Why won't you tell me anything?

5221
03:55:50,290 --> 03:55:50,830
Here you go again.

5222
03:55:50,930 --> 03:55:52,650
About what you were like as a child.

5223
03:55:52,870 --> 03:55:54,790
What kind of things you like to do.

5224
03:55:55,050 --> 03:55:57,670
Do you even like her Ryden?

5225
03:55:57,750 --> 03:55:59,250
I've never heard you talk about anything.

5226
03:55:59,910 --> 03:56:00,770
Oh my god.

5227
03:56:00,770 --> 03:56:01,630
I...

5228
03:56:01,630 --> 03:56:03,890
Don't you think it's just a little bit unusual?

5229
03:56:04,350 --> 03:56:07,690
That I don't know anything about my own boyfriend's past?

5230
03:56:08,410 --> 03:56:11,110
Rose, when I get back, I'll tell you everything.

5231
03:56:11,290 --> 03:56:11,670
Everything?

5232
03:56:11,750 --> 03:56:13,210
Is that a promise?

5233
03:56:14,710 --> 03:56:15,690
That's a death flag.

5234
03:56:17,690 --> 03:56:18,870
That's a death flag.

5235
03:56:19,130 --> 03:56:19,830
Right there.

5236
03:56:20,110 --> 03:56:20,350
Okay.

5237
03:56:21,270 --> 03:56:21,730
Alright.

5238
03:56:21,890 --> 03:56:24,210
If I die, I'm just gonna reload every time.

5239
03:56:24,910 --> 03:56:25,370
Okay.

5240
03:56:25,410 --> 03:56:26,930
I have to hold up this guy though.

5241
03:56:26,990 --> 03:56:27,730
I have to hold him up.

5242
03:56:28,790 --> 03:56:29,250
Okay.

5243
03:56:30,770 --> 03:56:32,170
This part's so annoying.

5244
03:56:37,160 --> 03:56:38,520
When he's in front of it, right?

5245
03:56:41,260 --> 03:56:41,740
Okay.

5246
03:56:41,940 --> 03:56:42,420
Um...

5247
03:56:43,200 --> 03:56:45,600
Can I... Do I use the AK or...

5248
03:56:45,600 --> 03:56:46,920
Can I use my gun?

5249
03:56:47,820 --> 03:56:48,500
There we go.

5250
03:56:48,720 --> 03:56:49,200
Okay.

5251
03:56:52,280 --> 03:56:53,440
Uh... Do it!

5252
03:56:57,290 --> 03:56:57,770
Do...

5253
03:56:57,770 --> 03:56:58,470
The thing.

5254
03:56:59,790 --> 03:57:00,550
Do... Oh.

5255
03:57:00,610 --> 03:57:01,430
I'm out of my uniform?

5256
03:57:01,710 --> 03:57:02,390
Do the thing!

5257
03:57:06,160 --> 03:57:06,820
Do it!

5258
03:57:09,100 --> 03:57:09,660
Uh...

5259
03:57:10,660 --> 03:57:11,220
Okay.

5260
03:57:11,820 --> 03:57:12,380
Oh.

5261
03:57:12,460 --> 03:57:12,840
Uh.

5262
03:57:13,000 --> 03:57:13,320
Whoops.

5263
03:57:16,040 --> 03:57:16,580
Come here.

5264
03:57:16,640 --> 03:57:17,380
Come here, you.

5265
03:57:18,660 --> 03:57:19,840
Use your eyes!

5266
03:57:20,000 --> 03:57:20,660
Your eyes!

5267
03:57:20,900 --> 03:57:21,260
Your eyes!

5268
03:57:21,560 --> 03:57:21,980
Oh.

5269
03:57:22,020 --> 03:57:22,460
Uh.

5270
03:57:48,780 --> 03:57:49,340
Yeah,

5271
03:57:56,040 --> 03:57:58,500
I accidentally tranked him and it took effect.

5272
03:58:00,560 --> 03:58:01,260
It's okay.

5273
03:58:01,560 --> 03:58:02,760
We'll just go through it again.

5274
03:58:02,900 --> 03:58:03,460
No worries.

5275
03:58:08,610 --> 03:58:09,790
Coolant spray to wake him up.

5276
03:58:09,830 --> 03:58:10,550
But that's so rude!

5277
03:58:12,130 --> 03:58:13,190
That's so rude.

5278
03:58:13,310 --> 03:58:14,070
We almost had him.

5279
03:58:14,190 --> 03:58:14,890
Yeah, but that's okay.

5280
03:58:14,930 --> 03:58:15,530
We can get him again.

5281
03:58:16,510 --> 03:58:17,290
No problem.

5282
03:58:19,090 --> 03:58:20,030
Come on, man.

5283
03:58:20,190 --> 03:58:20,650
Come on.

5284
03:58:28,130 --> 03:58:28,990
There he comes.

5285
03:58:29,870 --> 03:58:31,030
Worst shift ever.

5286
03:58:34,810 --> 03:58:35,250
Okay.

5287
03:58:36,810 --> 03:58:37,530
Oh my god.

5288
03:58:37,570 --> 03:58:38,670
That scared me.

5289
03:58:44,030 --> 03:58:44,550
Freeze!

5290
03:58:51,250 --> 03:58:51,770
Oh!

5291
03:58:51,870 --> 03:58:52,810
Now I did it again!

5292
03:58:56,210 --> 03:58:57,790
Retinol pattern recognized.

5293
03:58:58,110 --> 03:58:59,930
You are cleared to enter.

5294
03:59:00,170 --> 03:59:00,490
You know what?

5295
03:59:01,290 --> 03:59:02,610
If it works, it works.

5296
03:59:09,650 --> 03:59:10,950
Whatever works, works.

5297
03:59:12,170 --> 03:59:13,590
Alright, we got our AK.

5298
03:59:15,110 --> 03:59:16,990
We're gonna be real sneaky here.

5299
03:59:19,250 --> 03:59:21,190
We're gonna look for AIMS.

5300
03:59:21,390 --> 03:59:23,090
We're gonna say, you must be AIMS.

5301
03:59:23,990 --> 03:59:25,390
You must be AIMS.

5302
03:59:28,680 --> 03:59:30,600
We got our directional mic.

5303
03:59:32,000 --> 03:59:33,180
We're coming down.

5304
03:59:33,500 --> 03:59:35,620
We're looking all sneaky and such.

5305
03:59:36,880 --> 03:59:37,880
Oh yeah.

5306
03:59:40,160 --> 03:59:41,460
You must be AIMS.

5307
03:59:43,400 --> 03:59:46,160
I'm gonna listen to half Johnny, half the conversation.

5308
03:59:47,720 --> 03:59:48,800
I'm gonna listen to half Johnny, half the conversation.

5309
03:59:51,580 --> 03:59:54,360
One of those hostages in there is AIMS.

5310
03:59:54,480 --> 03:59:54,780
I know.

5311
03:59:55,020 --> 03:59:57,780
The only thing we know is that AIMS wears a pacemaker.

5312
03:59:57,820 --> 03:59:58,020
Okay.

5313
03:59:58,140 --> 04:00:00,280
His heartbeat should sound different from other people's.

5314
04:00:00,280 --> 04:00:01,080
The music in here is so cool.

5315
04:00:01,260 --> 04:00:03,740
So use the directional microphone to locate him.

5316
04:00:04,340 --> 04:00:09,100
Once you recognize AIMS by his heartbeat, keep the microphone pointed toward him.

5317
04:00:09,160 --> 04:00:11,840
Then push the action button and call out to him.

5318
04:00:12,320 --> 04:00:13,100
You must be AIMS.

5319
04:00:13,100 --> 04:00:15,600
If it really is AIMS, he should respond in some way.

5320
04:00:15,600 --> 04:00:17,300
What if it's the wrong person?

5321
04:00:17,640 --> 04:00:20,320
The guards may get suspicious and come running instead.

5322
04:00:20,560 --> 04:00:21,480
I kind of want to see though.

5323
04:00:22,300 --> 04:00:24,000
I'll just have to do the room again, right?

5324
04:00:24,940 --> 04:00:26,120
I want to see actually.

5325
04:00:26,540 --> 04:00:30,440
Don't call out to a hostage with the action button until you're fairly sure that it's AIMS.

5326
04:00:30,460 --> 04:00:31,320
Well what happens if I do?

5327
04:00:31,420 --> 04:00:31,980
It'll be funny.

5328
04:00:32,480 --> 04:00:34,380
Switch the microphone for an AK.

5329
04:00:34,640 --> 04:00:36,980
And get out of there before a guard gets suspicious.

5330
04:00:37,260 --> 04:00:37,500
Okay.

5331
04:00:37,780 --> 04:00:42,060
If you're discovered inside, they'll cut off your retreat and call in the reinforcements.

5332
04:00:42,220 --> 04:00:43,860
You won't make it out of the room.

5333
04:00:44,040 --> 04:00:46,100
The mission will be over if you're discovered.

5334
04:00:46,280 --> 04:00:50,380
Don your disguise and look for AIMS while deflecting the enemy's suspicion.

5335
04:00:57,890 --> 04:00:59,650
I'm so not suspicious.

5336
04:01:04,630 --> 04:01:06,550
I feel like we're gonna hear that a lot.

5337
04:01:07,310 --> 04:01:10,810
I just want to walk around and check out these guys for a bit.

5338
04:01:13,330 --> 04:01:14,930
Can I walk on top of you?

5339
04:01:15,290 --> 04:01:15,730
Sorry.

5340
04:01:16,070 --> 04:01:16,730
Excuse me.

5341
04:01:17,510 --> 04:01:18,170
Excuse me.

5342
04:01:19,690 --> 04:01:21,010
I'm grabbing stuff first.

5343
04:01:29,710 --> 04:01:31,670
The flag is on backwards!

5344
04:01:32,910 --> 04:01:35,010
I know there's patches to fix that.

5345
04:01:35,230 --> 04:01:36,830
The flag is on backwards.

5346
04:01:36,950 --> 04:01:37,610
Did you guys see that?

5347
04:01:41,150 --> 04:01:41,630
Oops.

5348
04:01:41,730 --> 04:01:42,330
Excuse me.

5349
04:01:42,790 --> 04:01:44,230
How many are there?

5350
04:01:44,310 --> 04:01:44,450
Two?

5351
04:01:45,170 --> 04:01:45,870
Two guys?

5352
04:01:46,030 --> 04:01:46,390
One guy?

5353
04:01:46,390 --> 04:01:46,530
Why?

5354
04:01:48,750 --> 04:01:49,310
Oh!

5355
04:01:49,410 --> 04:01:51,010
Oh my god.

5356
04:01:51,230 --> 04:01:51,790
Raiden?

5357
04:01:51,910 --> 04:01:52,370
What the hell?

5358
04:01:52,450 --> 04:01:53,290
This guy tripped me!

5359
04:01:55,150 --> 04:01:56,090
Where's my uniform?

5360
04:01:56,730 --> 04:01:57,410
Oh, here.

5361
04:01:59,920 --> 04:02:01,340
That guy tripped me!

5362
04:02:02,080 --> 04:02:03,080
What a jerk!

5363
04:02:13,460 --> 04:02:15,000
Your AIMS, aren't you?

5364
04:02:15,720 --> 04:02:15,800
Your AIMS, aren't you?

5365
04:02:20,430 --> 04:02:21,350
They weren't suspicious.

5366
04:02:22,610 --> 04:02:23,090
Hey.

5367
04:02:23,490 --> 04:02:24,690
Why didn't you say anything?

5368
04:02:26,470 --> 04:02:27,390
Talk, man!

5369
04:02:27,910 --> 04:02:29,670
I'm trying to ask you if you're AIMS or not.

5370
04:02:31,470 --> 04:02:32,130
Come on.

5371
04:02:32,150 --> 04:02:32,990
Are you AIMS or not?

5372
04:02:33,890 --> 04:02:34,850
Say something!

5373
04:02:35,270 --> 04:02:36,330
Say something!

5374
04:02:36,730 --> 04:02:37,190
Damn it!

5375
04:02:40,450 --> 04:02:40,930
Oh.

5376
04:02:45,070 --> 04:02:45,690
Hold on.

5377
04:02:45,690 --> 04:02:46,550
I want to talk to that lady.

5378
04:02:51,040 --> 04:02:53,240
I'm also supposed to be here.

5379
04:02:56,180 --> 04:02:57,220
Are you AIMS?

5380
04:02:57,860 --> 04:02:59,200
Your AIMS, aren't you?

5381
04:03:10,150 --> 04:03:11,670
Are you AIMS?

5382
04:03:13,690 --> 04:03:14,890
I get so upset.

5383
04:03:16,850 --> 04:03:18,470
Your AIMS, aren't you?

5384
04:03:24,090 --> 04:03:25,710
Your AIMS, aren't you?

5385
04:03:25,830 --> 04:03:26,050
No.

5386
04:03:27,470 --> 04:03:28,110
Nothing.

5387
04:03:28,310 --> 04:03:29,310
Nothing, here.

5388
04:03:29,610 --> 04:03:30,490
I'm just like you.

5389
04:03:30,930 --> 04:03:32,070
Nothing, here.

5390
04:03:33,150 --> 04:03:33,790
No.

5391
04:03:33,790 --> 04:03:34,430
Nothing.

5392
04:03:46,800 --> 04:03:48,780
Anybody else do something interesting?

5393
04:03:49,080 --> 04:03:50,040
Where's Jennifer?

5394
04:03:51,400 --> 04:03:52,240
I don't know.

5395
04:03:55,380 --> 04:03:55,740
Jenny?

5396
04:03:55,740 --> 04:04:00,590
Is that... that's her right there.

5397
04:04:03,270 --> 04:04:04,430
I've been trying to get to her though.

5398
04:04:05,670 --> 04:04:06,250
I think.

5399
04:04:06,350 --> 04:04:06,810
This is her.

5400
04:04:06,930 --> 04:04:07,410
It's got to be her.

5401
04:04:12,950 --> 04:04:14,010
My name's Jennifer.

5402
04:04:17,950 --> 04:04:19,270
My name's Jennifer.

5403
04:04:23,530 --> 04:04:24,890
My name's Jennifer.

5404
04:04:30,280 --> 04:04:31,780
My name's Jennifer.

5405
04:04:33,580 --> 04:04:35,380
I don't know why it's so funny.

5406
04:04:41,300 --> 04:04:43,740
I knew it was him the whole time.

5407
04:04:47,380 --> 04:04:48,540
My name's Jennifer.

5408
04:04:49,960 --> 04:04:51,660
Aim your mic at her and click L3.

5409
04:04:51,920 --> 04:04:52,440
Wait, what?

5410
04:04:57,980 --> 04:04:59,460
I knew it was him the whole time.

5411
04:04:59,720 --> 04:05:00,060
Sherman?

5412
04:05:00,280 --> 04:05:00,740
Okay.

5413
04:05:08,260 --> 04:05:10,140
What happens if you do that though?

5414
04:05:17,300 --> 04:05:17,880
That must be Ames.

5415
04:05:19,860 --> 04:05:21,520
No, I actually remembered where he was.

5416
04:05:22,920 --> 04:05:23,300
But...

5417
04:05:25,020 --> 04:05:26,500
I... don't remember.

5418
04:05:26,620 --> 04:05:29,500
There's some things that I remember and some things that I don't about this game.

5419
04:05:29,580 --> 04:05:30,000
It's so funny.

5420
04:05:33,900 --> 04:05:35,360
Maybe because I really like this part.

5421
04:05:37,320 --> 04:05:39,600
No, I was sent in by the Lali Lule Lo.

5422
04:05:39,920 --> 04:05:40,720
Lali Lule Lo?

5423
04:05:42,180 --> 04:05:42,940
Uh oh.

5424
04:05:43,680 --> 04:05:44,380
Oh no!

5425
04:05:45,160 --> 04:05:46,720
You're here to find out where the president is.

5426
04:05:46,720 --> 04:05:48,740
They always are watching me!

5427
04:05:49,260 --> 04:05:50,600
It's always Ocelot.

5428
04:05:53,320 --> 04:05:53,760
Yeah.

5429
04:05:55,180 --> 04:05:57,720
Why are you acting like you don't know what that is, Raiden?

5430
04:05:59,020 --> 04:05:59,740
Come on.

5431
04:06:00,420 --> 04:06:00,860
Raiden!

5432
04:06:03,500 --> 04:06:05,500
Why do you act like you don't know what that is?

5433
04:06:08,960 --> 04:06:11,800
You'll never listen in on my thoughts, Ocelot.

5434
04:06:12,360 --> 04:06:12,800
I know.

5435
04:06:12,800 --> 04:06:13,220
Right here.

5436
04:06:13,500 --> 04:06:15,360
Do you really know where the president is?

5437
04:06:15,360 --> 04:06:16,700
Almost certainly.

5438
04:06:16,900 --> 04:06:19,740
He was moved to the first floor of Shell 2's core section.

5439
04:06:20,040 --> 04:06:21,140
The first floor?

5440
04:06:21,220 --> 04:06:22,760
The core of Shell 2?

5441
04:06:23,620 --> 04:06:24,720
Is he still there?

5442
04:06:25,180 --> 04:06:25,640
I don't know.

5443
04:06:25,680 --> 04:06:26,720
I can't get a response.

5444
04:06:27,200 --> 04:06:27,840
Uh oh.

5445
04:06:27,860 --> 04:06:30,100
You don't think he's been like the other hostages?

5446
04:06:30,220 --> 04:06:30,260
No!

5447
04:06:31,200 --> 04:06:34,600
A hostage was killed in retaliation after the SEAL 10 disaster.

5448
04:06:34,840 --> 04:06:35,320
Remember?

5449
04:06:35,840 --> 04:06:36,620
What are you talking about?

5450
04:06:36,860 --> 04:06:37,180
Wait, what?

5451
04:06:37,560 --> 04:06:38,040
Huh?

5452
04:06:38,520 --> 04:06:40,720
Did they lie about the hostage getting killed?

5453
04:06:40,940 --> 04:06:42,100
They won't touch the president.

5454
04:06:42,420 --> 04:06:43,820
What makes you so sure?

5455
04:06:44,100 --> 04:06:44,720
The case.

5456
04:06:44,720 --> 04:06:46,880
You mean the nuclear button they took?

5457
04:06:47,200 --> 04:06:47,380
Right.

5458
04:06:47,640 --> 04:06:49,700
And the case won't do a thing by itself.

5459
04:06:50,040 --> 04:06:54,680
That case may be the single most advanced example of a weapon's failsafe system.

5460
04:06:54,880 --> 04:06:55,380
How do you know that?

5461
04:06:55,380 --> 04:06:59,180
The password is nothing less than the physiological data of the U.S.

5462
04:06:59,200 --> 04:06:59,560
president.

5463
04:07:00,360 --> 04:07:01,480
Physiological data?

5464
04:07:02,560 --> 04:07:04,800
Raiden's learning words for the first time.

5465
04:07:04,940 --> 04:07:11,700
Heartbeat, brainwave pattern, blood pressure and so on are constantly monitored and relayed by his internal nanomachines.

5466
04:07:11,880 --> 04:07:14,700
This information along with the DNA pattern...

5467
04:07:14,720 --> 04:07:16,480
serve as a biometric password.

5468
04:07:17,100 --> 04:07:21,000
Unbreakable even by the latest parallel processor supercomputers.

5469
04:07:21,140 --> 04:07:31,120
The password entry itself cannot be performed unless brainwave patterns and heartbeats fall within normal parameters rendering chemical and other forms of coercion impractical.

5470
04:07:31,120 --> 04:07:36,100
In other words, the login must be made of the president's own free will.

5471
04:07:36,360 --> 04:07:37,140
So smart.

5472
04:07:37,340 --> 04:07:42,560
As a failsafe, the input must also be reconfirmed hourly, even after the initial login.

5473
04:07:42,560 --> 04:07:47,960
If a valid confirmation is not forthcoming, the system will automatically cancel the login.

5474
04:07:48,180 --> 04:07:50,560
And that's why they can't harm the president.

5475
04:07:50,820 --> 04:07:52,620
At least until the bird flies.

5476
04:07:52,880 --> 04:07:55,940
Is there really a new model of Metal Gear here?

5477
04:07:56,060 --> 04:07:56,520
Absolutely.

5478
04:07:56,880 --> 04:08:00,220
The Black Case serves as the launch key to Metal Gear as well.

5479
04:08:00,840 --> 04:08:03,640
Why would they hide Metal Gear in an offshore plant?

5480
04:08:04,720 --> 04:08:06,060
Haven't they told you anything?

5481
04:08:06,520 --> 04:08:08,580
This is getting... this is so much deja vu.

5482
04:08:08,940 --> 04:08:10,660
This is so much deja vu!

5483
04:08:10,820 --> 04:08:12,060
The oil spill, the tanker accident that caused...

5484
04:08:12,060 --> 04:08:13,560
The first solid snake isn't told anything.

5485
04:08:13,900 --> 04:08:17,940
The big shell was built specifically for the development of a new Metal Gear model.

5486
04:08:18,260 --> 04:08:20,320
The inspection tool was to check its progress.

5487
04:08:20,680 --> 04:08:22,360
What's going on around here?

5488
04:08:23,460 --> 04:08:25,320
What's going on around here?

5489
04:08:25,980 --> 04:08:27,980
I love riding so much.

5490
04:08:28,420 --> 04:08:29,780
He's such a weenie.

5491
04:08:30,000 --> 04:08:30,800
I can't...

5492
04:08:33,480 --> 04:08:34,860
Nose for eye too.

5493
04:08:34,960 --> 04:08:35,300
That's him?

5494
04:08:35,480 --> 04:08:36,840
Oh my god, he looks just like Dracula.

5495
04:08:36,840 --> 04:08:38,140
Use the microphone to listen in.

5496
04:08:38,240 --> 04:08:38,440
Okay.

5497
04:08:38,540 --> 04:08:39,420
I'm gonna be sneaky.

5498
04:08:42,060 --> 04:08:42,200
No.

5499
04:08:42,500 --> 04:08:43,560
That's Solid Snake.

5500
04:08:44,340 --> 04:08:45,560
You spelled it wrong.

5501
04:08:45,840 --> 04:08:46,980
Jeremy, you spelled it wrong.

5502
04:08:47,060 --> 04:08:47,680
Solid Snake.

5503
04:08:55,120 --> 04:08:56,220
Aw, dang it.

5504
04:08:56,500 --> 04:08:56,800
No.

5505
04:08:57,080 --> 04:08:57,260
King.

5506
04:08:57,260 --> 04:08:59,000
Fat man is dead.

5507
04:08:59,360 --> 04:09:00,840
It doesn't matter.

5508
04:09:01,180 --> 04:09:01,620
King.

5509
04:09:01,780 --> 04:09:03,640
He does the trouble of getting rid of him ourselves.

5510
04:09:04,220 --> 04:09:06,080
Why did he betray us?

5511
04:09:11,660 --> 04:09:15,300
To come all the way to New York just to get hit with a bell attack.

5512
04:09:16,060 --> 04:09:19,000
And his background rechecked just in case.

5513
04:09:19,000 --> 04:09:19,380
I'm sorry.

5514
04:09:19,380 --> 04:09:21,800
You think he was working for them?

5515
04:09:22,020 --> 04:09:24,160
We can't discount the possibility.

5516
04:09:25,160 --> 04:09:27,380
Especially with that intruder still at large.

5517
04:09:28,180 --> 04:09:28,520
Yes.

5518
04:09:29,180 --> 04:09:29,580
Yes, sir.

5519
04:09:29,580 --> 04:09:31,140
The man in the sneaking suit.

5520
04:09:31,400 --> 04:09:31,960
Yes.

5521
04:09:31,980 --> 04:09:34,580
You know more about those suits than I do.

5522
04:09:35,080 --> 04:09:37,680
But Foxhound was disbanded four years ago.

5523
04:09:37,680 --> 04:09:38,320
Because he's Solid Snake.

5524
04:09:38,720 --> 04:09:39,100
So he was.

5525
04:09:39,800 --> 04:09:41,000
What a block.

5526
04:09:41,820 --> 04:09:42,500
Oh.

5527
04:09:46,320 --> 04:09:48,540
This one's worse than that one up in Alaska.

5528
04:09:48,880 --> 04:09:49,460
Oh.

5529
04:09:50,140 --> 04:09:50,420
Oh.

5530
04:09:51,040 --> 04:09:54,320
That commander chick really reminds me of someone.

5531
04:09:55,060 --> 04:09:56,380
Who is she like again?

5532
04:09:56,600 --> 04:09:56,700
Oh.

5533
04:09:59,540 --> 04:10:00,700
He's thinking of her.

5534
04:10:01,680 --> 04:10:05,660
The circulation system for the contaminated water has been damaged.

5535
04:10:05,920 --> 04:10:08,300
The water being drawn in is overflowing.

5536
04:10:08,580 --> 04:10:10,680
And the lower block of the central section is flooded.

5537
04:10:10,680 --> 04:10:11,520
That commander chick.

5538
04:10:11,580 --> 04:10:12,520
He's thinking of Marilyn.

5539
04:10:14,580 --> 04:10:15,540
She's like her.

5540
04:10:16,320 --> 04:10:18,120
Now that's a time I'd like to forget.

5541
04:10:19,520 --> 04:10:20,960
Ridiculous that I had to get jacked.

5542
04:10:21,020 --> 04:10:22,220
I'm gonna go back for everything that was on me.

5543
04:10:23,040 --> 04:10:24,220
When I think about it.

5544
04:10:24,440 --> 04:10:26,300
That's when everything started to hit the skid.

5545
04:10:27,060 --> 04:10:27,880
That's a shame.

5546
04:10:28,220 --> 04:10:30,940
Up to that point I was steady cruising on the elite course.

5547
04:10:31,420 --> 04:10:31,780
Oh!

5548
04:10:32,440 --> 04:10:33,540
Here we go again.

5549
04:10:35,180 --> 04:10:37,700
Syntax and IR sensors are already in place.

5550
04:10:37,980 --> 04:10:39,820
Any effect on it?

5551
04:10:40,080 --> 04:10:40,560
No.

5552
04:10:41,060 --> 04:10:41,800
What about the present?

5553
04:10:41,800 --> 04:10:43,100
He's in there fighting for his life.

5554
04:10:43,240 --> 04:10:44,460
The password entry is on.

5555
04:10:44,460 --> 04:10:44,900
He's alive?

5556
04:10:45,160 --> 04:10:46,000
The black case.

5557
04:10:46,000 --> 04:10:46,740
Oh no.

5558
04:10:46,840 --> 04:10:48,980
One hour will need a confirmation from him.

5559
04:10:49,240 --> 04:10:50,620
His work is done.

5560
04:10:50,700 --> 04:10:51,000
Thank God.

5561
04:10:51,020 --> 04:10:51,540
No, no!

5562
04:10:54,900 --> 04:10:57,560
Yes, sir.

5563
04:11:00,100 --> 04:11:01,240
Oh, no!

5564
04:11:03,520 --> 04:11:05,440
The girl?

5565
04:11:07,040 --> 04:11:08,960
He's fighting his own battles.

5566
04:11:09,240 --> 04:11:09,800
Drugs?

5567
04:11:13,900 --> 04:11:16,580
Oh my god!

5568
04:11:16,840 --> 04:11:19,580
Look at him, he's daydreaming right there.

5569
04:11:25,140 --> 04:11:28,000
Still, that Russian crew is a pretty decent bunch.

5570
04:11:28,360 --> 04:11:31,380
Who is that cyborg ninja, Shalashaska?

5571
04:11:31,600 --> 04:11:33,120
I cannot even guess.

5572
04:11:33,620 --> 04:11:34,660
What about you?

5573
04:11:35,960 --> 04:11:36,560
Looked into.

5574
04:11:37,520 --> 04:11:40,320
Olga, don't cast suspicion where it isn't due.

5575
04:11:40,540 --> 04:11:41,860
Where it isn't due?

5576
04:11:42,000 --> 04:11:44,840
When you watched my father die and did nothing.

5577
04:11:45,160 --> 04:11:47,020
It's been two years ago, Olga.

5578
04:11:47,100 --> 04:11:47,680
Let it go.

5579
04:11:48,000 --> 04:11:51,380
I read the case file for Shadow Moses, by the way.

5580
04:11:51,460 --> 04:11:53,760
Olga, how could you suspect me?

5581
04:11:53,980 --> 04:11:56,940
I know that the ninja is not one of my men.

5582
04:11:57,120 --> 04:11:59,320
How meaningful you make that sound.

5583
04:11:59,540 --> 04:12:01,220
It's Sergei, we're still alive.

5584
04:12:01,700 --> 04:12:02,680
Let it go.

5585
04:12:02,740 --> 04:12:03,720
Olga, it's been two years.

5586
04:12:03,980 --> 04:12:05,760
It was just your dad.

5587
04:12:05,940 --> 04:12:06,540
Come on.

5588
04:12:06,820 --> 04:12:08,500
Sergei was my best friend.

5589
04:12:08,860 --> 04:12:11,840
If you sell us out, I'll kill you myself.

5590
04:12:11,880 --> 04:12:12,660
Look at them.

5591
04:12:12,860 --> 04:12:14,500
Listen, daughter of Sergei.

5592
04:12:14,580 --> 04:12:17,540
Don't ever let me see your gun pointed at me again.

5593
04:12:19,540 --> 04:12:23,480
If you wish, I'll put a bullet in your back instead.

5594
04:12:25,960 --> 04:12:28,940
I took you both in when no one else would.

5595
04:12:29,200 --> 04:12:33,860
You think any government would have you as irregulars in this political climate?

5596
04:12:34,100 --> 04:12:36,360
The worst kind of wet works, maybe.

5597
04:12:36,560 --> 04:12:38,060
But even that's doubtful.

5598
04:12:38,200 --> 04:12:40,640
I recommend against switching camps.

5599
04:12:41,100 --> 04:12:42,840
You've nowhere left to go.

5600
04:12:50,160 --> 04:12:51,000
Bye-bye.

5601
04:12:54,890 --> 04:12:56,530
The president's escort, guys.

5602
04:12:56,750 --> 04:12:57,910
Get on my nerves.

5603
04:12:59,570 --> 04:13:00,130
Whatever.

5604
04:13:00,730 --> 04:13:03,130
For now, just gotta hang in there.

5605
04:13:03,690 --> 04:13:05,050
You got this, daddy.

5606
04:13:07,730 --> 04:13:08,950
There's no paper.

5607
04:13:13,950 --> 04:13:15,350
It's happening again.

5608
04:13:15,730 --> 04:13:17,590
This damn right arm.

5609
04:13:18,090 --> 04:13:18,650
Liquid.

5610
04:13:19,510 --> 04:13:21,790
It's almost as if it's having its revenge.

5611
04:13:22,310 --> 04:13:25,350
How much do you think we spent on that arm and Leo?

5612
04:13:25,470 --> 04:13:28,870
The best transplant surgery team in the world.

5613
04:13:29,170 --> 04:13:31,110
I never trust a Frenchman.

5614
04:13:35,330 --> 04:13:37,330
Johnny, are you okay in there?

5615
04:13:37,810 --> 04:13:38,450
Oh.

5616
04:13:38,790 --> 04:13:40,570
There's something going on.

5617
04:13:40,970 --> 04:13:43,270
The incidents are becoming more frequent.

5618
04:13:43,650 --> 04:13:45,770
Maybe that man's presence.

5619
04:13:46,010 --> 04:13:46,890
What man?

5620
04:13:47,290 --> 04:13:49,670
I leave this place in your hands.

5621
04:13:49,950 --> 04:13:52,750
I have the intruder to take care of.

5622
04:13:53,210 --> 04:13:54,110
Yes, King.

5623
04:13:54,830 --> 04:13:55,750
Yes, King.

5624
04:13:58,810 --> 04:14:00,510
I hope Johnny's okay.

5625
04:14:02,370 --> 04:14:03,830
Johnny's on his own battlefield.

5626
04:14:04,230 --> 04:14:04,810
It's true.

5627
04:14:05,690 --> 04:14:06,950
He must be Ames.

5628
04:14:07,310 --> 04:14:08,890
Is that really Solid Snake?

5629
04:14:09,750 --> 04:14:10,850
That's what he claims.

5630
04:14:10,990 --> 04:14:12,830
Johnny's fighting his own liquid right now.

5631
04:14:12,870 --> 04:14:13,510
See you.

5632
04:14:13,570 --> 04:14:14,750
Solid Snake did die.

5633
04:14:15,550 --> 04:14:17,070
But he's also here in the shell.

5634
04:14:17,590 --> 04:14:18,630
Makes no sense.

5635
04:14:18,670 --> 04:14:19,830
Either he survived or there are two of them.

5636
04:14:19,950 --> 04:14:20,410
What?

5637
04:14:20,530 --> 04:14:21,270
Two of them.

5638
04:14:21,730 --> 04:14:22,230
Yippee.

5639
04:14:22,230 --> 04:14:22,830
That's impossible.

5640
04:14:23,410 --> 04:14:24,330
Two of them.

5641
04:14:26,050 --> 04:14:27,950
I wish there were more Solid Snakes.

5642
04:14:29,070 --> 04:14:31,130
Anyway, what did you manage to catch?

5643
04:14:31,310 --> 04:14:33,890
They said password input was complete.

5644
04:14:34,050 --> 04:14:34,950
I thought so.

5645
04:14:35,390 --> 04:14:37,310
And then there was also this guy.

5646
04:14:37,330 --> 04:14:37,950
He was just...

5647
04:14:37,950 --> 04:14:40,230
Had to be made by the president willingly.

5648
04:14:40,770 --> 04:14:41,450
That's right.

5649
04:14:41,670 --> 04:14:42,050
Yes.

5650
04:14:42,130 --> 04:14:44,710
So this means the president is cooperating with them.

5651
04:14:44,850 --> 04:14:46,450
It would have to be, yes.

5652
04:14:47,030 --> 04:14:47,530
Why?

5653
04:14:47,870 --> 04:14:48,370
Why?

5654
04:14:48,470 --> 04:14:49,570
Probably tired of being a puppet.

5655
04:14:49,830 --> 04:14:52,210
But it wasn't a smart move to betray us.

5656
04:14:52,210 --> 04:14:52,550
Hmm.

5657
04:14:52,930 --> 04:14:53,070
The puppet?

5658
04:14:53,450 --> 04:14:54,670
We're running out of time.

5659
04:14:54,810 --> 04:14:56,490
They will fire a nuke.

5660
04:14:56,630 --> 04:14:58,350
You know what you need to do before then.

5661
04:14:58,650 --> 04:14:59,730
Fire the nuke?

5662
04:14:59,770 --> 04:15:01,690
But it's nowhere close to the ransom deadline.

5663
04:15:01,910 --> 04:15:02,130
Yeah.

5664
04:15:02,370 --> 04:15:02,830
Ransom.

5665
04:15:03,090 --> 04:15:05,150
Thirty billion dollars in cash.

5666
04:15:05,250 --> 04:15:06,830
Why does nobody know what this ransom is?

5667
04:15:07,130 --> 04:15:07,190
What are you battling about?

5668
04:15:07,190 --> 04:15:09,010
The nuclear strike is not a threat.

5669
04:15:09,150 --> 04:15:10,910
It's been the objective all along.

5670
04:15:11,110 --> 04:15:13,330
They plan to slaughter millions of people.

5671
04:15:13,610 --> 04:15:13,930
No.

5672
04:15:14,050 --> 04:15:16,270
A high altitude detonation.

5673
04:15:16,450 --> 04:15:17,830
You've heard of the Compton effect?

5674
04:15:18,130 --> 04:15:18,910
Total disruption of electronic equipment.

5675
04:15:18,910 --> 04:15:21,250
It's gonna be raining nuclear bits.

5676
04:15:21,330 --> 04:15:21,810
Caused by EMF.

5677
04:15:21,810 --> 04:15:21,870
It's gonna be raining nuclear bits.

5678
04:15:21,870 --> 04:15:21,930
It's gonna be raining nuclear bits.

5679
04:15:21,930 --> 04:15:22,190
Caused by EMF.

5680
04:15:22,190 --> 04:15:22,950
The EMMA pulse.

5681
04:15:23,490 --> 04:15:24,130
Textbook answer.

5682
04:15:24,770 --> 04:15:32,390
Well, when an average nuclear warhead goes off within the atmosphere, the result is an electromagnetic pulse of up to 50 billion megawatts.

5683
04:15:32,970 --> 04:15:34,770
That's like calling Solid Snake King.

5684
04:15:35,210 --> 04:15:36,070
Oh boy.

5685
04:15:37,050 --> 04:15:40,330
And most electronic equipment will be toast in an instant.

5686
04:15:40,770 --> 04:15:47,150
If one of the key movers of world economy stops functioning, it could mean the beginning of a global depression.

5687
04:15:48,050 --> 04:15:48,610
No!

5688
04:15:48,970 --> 04:15:50,330
I'm already too depressed!

5689
04:15:50,870 --> 04:15:52,170
I can't be any more depressed.

5690
04:15:52,190 --> 04:15:52,730
Depressed please.

5691
04:15:53,030 --> 04:15:55,450
Pull it offline and turn it into some kind of a republic.

5692
04:15:55,750 --> 04:15:57,710
Hence, Sons of Liberty.

5693
04:15:57,950 --> 04:15:58,270
I suppose.

5694
04:15:58,490 --> 04:15:59,470
Sons of Liberty.

5695
04:16:00,630 --> 04:16:01,110
Damn!

5696
04:16:01,630 --> 04:16:02,470
Ocelot is coming.

5697
04:16:02,570 --> 04:16:03,390
I'm going offline.

5698
04:16:03,650 --> 04:16:04,070
I'm going offline!

5699
04:16:08,390 --> 04:16:09,350
Wrong movie.

5700
04:16:12,350 --> 04:16:13,870
They said the name of the game.

5701
04:16:14,230 --> 04:16:15,270
Sons of Liberty.

5702
04:16:15,430 --> 04:16:15,570
Search my pocket.

5703
04:16:16,070 --> 04:16:16,550
Hurry.

5704
04:16:16,750 --> 04:16:17,090
Oh, okay.

5705
04:16:18,410 --> 04:16:19,710
How do I know which pocket?

5706
04:16:19,870 --> 04:16:20,490
Oh, thanks!

5707
04:16:20,710 --> 04:16:22,170
You will be able to unlock doors of up to left.

5708
04:16:22,170 --> 04:16:23,110
Level 3 security.

5709
04:16:23,210 --> 04:16:24,670
Use it to get to Shell 2.

5710
04:16:24,890 --> 04:16:25,170
Okay.

5711
04:16:26,050 --> 04:16:28,690
Take care of the president before they launch the nuke.

5712
04:16:28,850 --> 04:16:29,230
Okay.

5713
04:16:32,010 --> 04:16:33,070
He's on his way!

5714
04:16:34,410 --> 04:16:36,510
He's looking really sassy.

5715
04:16:36,790 --> 04:16:37,330
He's coming here.

5716
04:16:37,490 --> 04:16:38,210
Pick up your AK.

5717
04:16:38,690 --> 04:16:40,370
Stop yelling at me, Ames!

5718
04:16:40,390 --> 04:16:41,290
He's gonna hear you!

5719
04:16:50,270 --> 04:16:51,250
I got my AK.

5720
04:16:51,590 --> 04:16:51,950
Oh.

5721
04:16:52,690 --> 04:16:53,850
That was so fast.

5722
04:16:55,610 --> 04:16:56,090
Oh.

5723
04:16:58,760 --> 04:16:59,600
That was it.

5724
04:17:00,420 --> 04:17:02,460
What do you think you're doing?

5725
04:17:04,180 --> 04:17:04,980
Nothing, sir.

5726
04:17:05,080 --> 04:17:06,220
I asked him to remove these.

5727
04:17:06,520 --> 04:17:07,720
I'm ill, you see.

5728
04:17:09,680 --> 04:17:13,280
I always knew that the DIA turned out second-rate liars.

5729
04:17:13,660 --> 04:17:15,000
What are you talking about?

5730
04:17:15,580 --> 04:17:17,100
No need for denials.

5731
04:17:18,020 --> 04:17:21,340
We know what you are, Colonel Ames.

5732
04:17:21,520 --> 04:17:22,860
You know what I am!

5733
04:17:23,140 --> 04:17:25,860
They knew that the president was planning to betray them.

5734
04:17:27,460 --> 04:17:29,260
So they sent you in to keep tabs on him.

5735
04:17:30,120 --> 04:17:30,960
Am I right?

5736
04:17:31,020 --> 04:17:31,520
A vampire.

5737
04:17:32,360 --> 04:17:32,840
You.

5738
04:17:34,440 --> 04:17:35,380
Sorry, Colonel.

5739
04:17:35,580 --> 04:17:37,540
You failed to carry out your duties.

5740
04:17:37,940 --> 04:17:40,100
You'll never escape the lalilulelo.

5741
04:17:40,180 --> 04:17:40,480
No!

5742
04:17:40,700 --> 04:17:41,780
The lalilulelo!

5743
04:17:45,360 --> 04:17:46,320
What the?

5744
04:17:49,420 --> 04:17:50,380
What the?

5745
04:17:50,820 --> 04:17:51,800
It's not IBS, is it?

5746
04:18:03,570 --> 04:18:04,270
Uh-oh.

5747
04:18:06,530 --> 04:18:07,050
You.

5748
04:18:07,270 --> 04:18:08,550
Which team are you with?

5749
04:18:08,810 --> 04:18:11,170
Show me your face.

5750
04:18:13,710 --> 04:18:15,530
You know who he is?

5751
04:18:16,090 --> 04:18:16,390
No.

5752
04:18:16,630 --> 04:18:18,110
He is not one of mine.

5753
04:18:18,310 --> 04:18:19,630
You know me.

5754
04:18:19,690 --> 04:18:20,590
What are you talking about?

5755
04:18:21,090 --> 04:18:21,850
Identify yourself.

5756
04:18:23,010 --> 04:18:24,530
Billy, we've gone way back.

5757
04:18:25,190 --> 04:18:26,250
Oh my gosh.

5758
04:18:26,270 --> 04:18:26,990
You're so beautiful.

5759
04:18:27,250 --> 04:18:27,990
You need it last.

5760
04:18:28,030 --> 04:18:29,210
The hair flip.

5761
04:18:33,030 --> 04:18:34,290
Get his arm!

5762
04:18:34,290 --> 04:18:35,970
Oh, not this time.

5763
04:18:38,890 --> 04:18:40,210
It's that ninja!

5764
04:18:44,430 --> 04:18:46,210
My name is Jennifer!

5765
04:18:47,330 --> 04:18:48,050
Hurry.

5766
04:18:48,150 --> 04:18:48,690
Get away.

5767
04:18:48,990 --> 04:18:49,710
Hurry.

5768
04:18:50,110 --> 04:18:50,470
Get away.

5769
04:18:50,950 --> 04:18:52,370
Jennifer, are you okay?

5770
04:18:53,030 --> 04:18:53,430
You.

5771
04:18:53,570 --> 04:18:54,370
But you died.

5772
04:19:01,880 --> 04:19:02,960
Gray Fox.

5773
04:19:02,960 --> 04:19:03,040
Gray Fox.

5774
04:19:07,380 --> 04:19:08,000
Yeah!

5775
04:19:09,160 --> 04:19:09,780
Okay.

5776
04:19:09,900 --> 04:19:10,780
I'm getting out of here.

5777
04:19:12,400 --> 04:19:13,020
Yup.

5778
04:19:13,140 --> 04:19:14,140
Don't mind me.

5779
04:19:14,240 --> 04:19:14,800
I'm getting out.

5780
04:19:17,320 --> 04:19:17,940
Okay.

5781
04:19:19,980 --> 04:19:21,860
You can't have my other arm.

5782
04:19:25,990 --> 04:19:26,610
Wait.

5783
04:19:29,790 --> 04:19:30,410
Ah!

5784
04:19:42,710 --> 04:19:43,330
No!

5785
04:19:44,170 --> 04:19:44,550
Wake it up!

5786
04:19:44,570 --> 04:19:44,710
Wake it up!

5787
04:19:45,570 --> 04:19:47,430
Wake it up!

5788
04:19:47,430 --> 04:19:48,090
That's unfortunate.

5789
04:19:48,090 --> 04:19:50,170
However, we do at least know where the president is.

5790
04:19:50,170 --> 04:19:50,610
That's unfortunate.

5791
04:19:51,010 --> 04:19:53,930
So there really is a new type of metal gear in this place?

5792
04:19:54,470 --> 04:19:54,950
Apparently.

5793
04:19:55,370 --> 04:19:55,730
No.

5794
04:19:55,850 --> 04:19:56,970
We're still looking into it.

5795
04:19:57,030 --> 04:19:57,330
No.

5796
04:19:57,470 --> 04:20:01,730
I've also been told that the nuclear strike was what the terrorists were after from the start.

5797
04:20:01,970 --> 04:20:03,790
Not the 30 billion dollars.

5798
04:20:03,810 --> 04:20:04,390
I'm scared.

5799
04:20:05,530 --> 04:20:07,490
It was a cover-up all along.

5800
04:20:07,730 --> 04:20:09,550
Colonel, what are you keeping from me?

5801
04:20:09,630 --> 04:20:09,870
Yup.

5802
04:20:09,870 --> 04:20:11,670
You told me about the 30 billion.

5803
04:20:11,930 --> 04:20:14,130
It's not as though I'm told all the facts either.

5804
04:20:14,370 --> 04:20:14,870
Uh-huh.

5805
04:20:15,870 --> 04:20:19,050
I'm pulling in all the favors I can to look into all this.

5806
04:20:19,270 --> 04:20:19,570
Uh-huh.

5807
04:20:19,570 --> 04:20:20,290
Just be real patient.

5808
04:20:20,290 --> 04:20:21,010
This has happened.

5809
04:20:21,090 --> 04:20:24,010
This is all deja vu from Shadow Moses.

5810
04:20:24,410 --> 04:20:29,350
We can take it that they've completed the password entry and are preparing metal gear for nuclear strike.

5811
04:20:29,490 --> 04:20:29,750
No.

5812
04:20:29,830 --> 04:20:31,930
Get to the president as soon as possible.

5813
04:20:32,570 --> 04:20:35,010
But the president is cooperating with them.

5814
04:20:35,450 --> 04:20:37,090
According to Ames, yes.

5815
04:20:37,730 --> 04:20:38,230
Ames.

5816
04:20:38,230 --> 04:20:40,530
But it's also true that they're about to get rid of the president.

5817
04:20:40,730 --> 04:20:41,230
To Ames.

5818
04:20:41,230 --> 04:20:42,930
There's something else going on here.

5819
04:20:43,090 --> 04:20:44,850
And the president may be able to get rid of the president.

5820
04:20:44,850 --> 04:20:46,830
The president may be able to tell you what it is when you see him in person.

5821
04:20:47,710 --> 04:20:51,350
Once they get the confirmation for nuclear launch, they'll do it.

5822
04:20:51,450 --> 04:20:53,910
You need to rescue the president before then.

5823
04:20:53,990 --> 04:20:54,230
Okay.

5824
04:20:54,850 --> 04:20:56,610
Jack, I agree with the colonel.

5825
04:20:56,690 --> 04:20:58,990
You need to protect the president for now.

5826
04:20:59,170 --> 04:20:59,870
Protect the president.

5827
04:21:00,170 --> 04:21:00,250
All right.

5828
04:21:01,290 --> 04:21:01,950
Oh my gosh.

5829
04:21:01,990 --> 04:21:02,170
Wait.

5830
04:21:02,250 --> 04:21:02,730
I'm not ready.

5831
04:21:04,750 --> 04:21:05,510
I'm a box.

5832
04:21:11,840 --> 04:21:12,940
I'm just a box.

5833
04:21:14,440 --> 04:21:14,920
I

5834
04:21:32,800 --> 04:21:34,520
have the same...

5835
04:21:36,040 --> 04:21:36,480
Oh.

5836
04:21:36,480 --> 04:21:37,340
No, I don't.

5837
04:21:37,560 --> 04:21:38,280
I'm a box.

5838
04:21:43,150 --> 04:21:44,510
Where do I go from here, actually?

5839
04:21:46,010 --> 04:21:47,090
Colonel, where am I going?

5840
04:21:49,170 --> 04:21:52,130
To use the elevator, get in and stand in front of the panel on the left side.

5841
04:21:52,130 --> 04:21:53,610
I know how to use the elevator, Colonel.

5842
04:21:53,970 --> 04:21:56,930
When the panel appears, choose a floor and press the enter button.

5843
04:21:57,070 --> 04:21:58,630
And the elevator will start moving.

5844
04:21:59,410 --> 04:22:00,850
Rose, don't join in.

5845
04:22:01,030 --> 04:22:03,170
You can use the right analog stick to survey your surroundings.

5846
04:22:03,170 --> 04:22:03,350
I know.

5847
04:22:03,570 --> 04:22:05,390
Keep an eye out for approaching enemies.

5848
04:22:08,970 --> 04:22:09,390
Hello.

5849
04:22:12,670 --> 04:22:13,590
Oh no.

5850
04:22:19,150 --> 04:22:21,170
Where do I go?

5851
04:22:21,970 --> 04:22:22,610
Okay.

5852
04:22:23,590 --> 04:22:26,810
First floor of Shell 2's core.

5853
04:22:29,050 --> 04:22:30,110
Strut D.

5854
04:22:32,850 --> 04:22:33,270
Okay.

5855
04:22:34,830 --> 04:22:36,150
Also, Puskin?

5856
04:22:36,350 --> 04:22:37,230
Where are you?

5857
04:22:39,390 --> 04:22:39,830
Okay.

5858
04:22:41,510 --> 04:22:41,950
Okay.

5859
04:22:43,410 --> 04:22:44,070
Strut D.

5860
04:22:47,150 --> 04:22:47,770
That way.

5861
04:22:48,570 --> 04:22:51,930
Do I have to go out through E then?

5862
04:22:52,090 --> 04:22:52,770
And then go to D?

5863
04:22:52,870 --> 04:22:53,070
Wait.

5864
04:22:53,450 --> 04:22:55,010
Was I able to make it there?

5865
04:22:55,290 --> 04:22:56,150
I'm trying to remember.

5866
04:22:57,550 --> 04:22:59,570
Do I have to go out this way?

5867
04:23:00,590 --> 04:23:01,030
Wait.

5868
04:23:01,070 --> 04:23:03,550
This BC connecting is broken.

5869
04:23:04,090 --> 04:23:04,530
Right?

5870
04:23:04,610 --> 04:23:07,550
And so I need to go to this way.

5871
04:23:08,930 --> 04:23:10,310
Yeah the other one is destroyed.

5872
04:23:10,890 --> 04:23:19,070
Okay so we just have to somehow get out of here without being noticed.

5873
04:23:24,040 --> 04:23:25,080
Just a box.

5874
04:23:25,920 --> 04:23:26,380
Just a box.

5875
04:23:26,920 --> 04:23:29,700
We just have to somehow get out of here without being noticed.

5876
04:23:29,700 --> 04:23:29,720
Oh.

5877
04:23:29,820 --> 04:23:29,920
Gosh.

5878
04:23:30,040 --> 04:23:30,300
Oh.

5879
04:23:30,300 --> 04:23:31,360
Now there's other people coming too.

5880
04:23:32,380 --> 04:23:33,360
Get out of here.

5881
04:23:36,580 --> 04:23:37,540
Turn around.

5882
04:23:37,860 --> 04:23:38,400
Turn around.

5883
04:23:38,700 --> 04:23:38,920
Turn around.

5884
04:23:38,920 --> 04:23:38,960
Turn around.

5885
04:23:39,380 --> 04:23:39,860
Turn around.

5886
04:23:39,860 --> 04:23:41,940
I don't want your sass!

5887
04:23:44,310 --> 04:23:44,660
Okay.

5888
04:23:44,860 --> 04:23:46,520
I need you to go away.

5889
04:23:47,380 --> 04:23:48,000
There we go.

5890
04:23:48,180 --> 04:23:49,060
Perfect timing.

5891
04:23:49,320 --> 04:23:49,980
Awesome.

5892
04:23:54,850 --> 04:23:56,170
Not perfect timing.

5893
04:23:59,920 --> 04:24:00,970
Oh god.

5894
04:24:02,210 --> 04:24:03,090
Oh shit.

5895
04:24:23,910 --> 04:24:24,950
Nothing here.

5896
04:24:33,190 --> 04:24:34,230
Nothing here.

5897
04:24:40,530 --> 04:24:41,450
Oh my god.

5898
04:24:41,510 --> 04:24:41,950
No way.

5899
04:24:43,590 --> 04:24:44,110
How?

5900
04:24:51,500 --> 04:24:53,260
Where's the guy that's supposed to be up there?

5901
04:25:02,300 --> 04:25:03,000
Oh shoot.

5902
04:25:06,040 --> 04:25:06,780
There he is.

5903
04:25:06,780 --> 04:25:07,280
I see him now.

5904
04:25:08,380 --> 04:25:09,220
Oh my goodness.

5905
04:25:10,300 --> 04:25:10,780
Wait.

5906
04:25:10,900 --> 04:25:11,560
I don't want to get caught.

5907
04:25:12,320 --> 04:25:13,300
Don't see me.

5908
04:25:13,620 --> 04:25:14,380
There he is.

5909
04:25:15,360 --> 04:25:15,980
Snipe him!

5910
04:25:16,800 --> 04:25:18,120
Snipe him from here!

5911
04:25:19,000 --> 04:25:20,720
Over a little... over a little...

5912
04:25:20,720 --> 04:25:21,080
There!

5913
04:25:21,960 --> 04:25:22,440
Damn.

5914
04:25:23,600 --> 04:25:24,080
Close.

5915
04:25:25,480 --> 04:25:26,640
He's... don't look.

5916
04:25:27,020 --> 04:25:27,860
Don't look mister.

5917
04:25:31,560 --> 04:25:32,060
It's okay.

5918
04:25:32,180 --> 04:25:33,900
Let's just... let's take these out first, right?

5919
04:25:34,020 --> 04:25:34,260
Yeah.

5920
04:25:34,560 --> 04:25:36,560
Who cares about that guy?

5921
04:25:36,700 --> 04:25:36,820
Oh.

5922
04:25:36,900 --> 04:25:37,740
It's on the other side.

5923
04:25:38,300 --> 04:25:39,320
Don't... don't shoot him.

5924
04:25:39,400 --> 04:25:39,820
No, no, no.

5925
04:25:43,120 --> 04:25:44,280
Just checked into my hotel.

5926
04:25:45,740 --> 04:25:47,060
Lali Lulee Long Beach.

5927
04:25:49,460 --> 04:25:50,220
Oh my gosh.

5928
04:25:50,360 --> 04:25:50,580
Wait.

5929
04:25:51,140 --> 04:25:52,620
Don't watch me at the hotel.

5930
04:25:55,200 --> 04:25:56,000
That's so funny.

5931
04:25:56,860 --> 04:25:57,220
Okay.

5932
04:25:57,240 --> 04:25:57,880
Can I get him now?

5933
04:25:58,820 --> 04:25:59,180
Oh.

5934
04:25:59,200 --> 04:25:59,480
Come on.

5935
04:26:00,740 --> 04:26:01,460
There we go.

5936
04:26:01,800 --> 04:26:02,680
See you guys.

5937
04:26:02,780 --> 04:26:04,100
I have a God aim.

5938
04:26:05,000 --> 04:26:05,900
Most of the time.

5939
04:26:09,080 --> 04:26:09,560
Oh.

5940
04:26:09,800 --> 04:26:10,560
God aim.

5941
04:26:10,700 --> 04:26:10,940
Oh.

5942
04:26:12,320 --> 04:26:14,020
God... God... aim.

5943
04:26:14,880 --> 04:26:15,840
God... aim.

5944
04:26:16,480 --> 04:26:16,960
Yeah.

5945
04:26:17,880 --> 04:26:18,740
And one more.

5946
04:26:21,060 --> 04:26:22,480
This one's a little tricky.

5947
04:26:22,700 --> 04:26:23,860
He's a little fast.

5948
04:26:24,020 --> 04:26:25,140
He's a little furious.

5949
04:26:27,760 --> 04:26:28,240
Yeah!

5950
04:26:28,900 --> 04:26:31,830
Talking about baby!

5951
04:26:31,830 --> 04:26:35,510
Am I good over here or...

5952
04:26:36,110 --> 04:26:37,530
Are there more bombs?

5953
04:26:38,230 --> 04:26:39,210
Run, Raiden!

5954
04:26:39,370 --> 04:26:40,330
Just run!

5955
04:26:44,690 --> 04:26:45,330
We're good.

5956
04:26:48,190 --> 04:26:49,310
That was really cool.

5957
04:26:51,210 --> 04:26:51,770
Wait.

5958
04:26:51,910 --> 04:26:52,830
How am I supposed to get...

5959
04:26:53,550 --> 04:26:54,110
Wait.

5960
04:26:57,890 --> 04:26:58,850
What's inside here?

5961
04:26:59,010 --> 04:26:59,290
Oh!

5962
04:26:59,670 --> 04:27:01,010
I know what's inside here.

5963
04:27:05,240 --> 04:27:06,340
The parcel room!

5964
04:27:08,120 --> 04:27:09,600
There's so many more guys, though.

5965
04:27:09,740 --> 04:27:10,220
Wait a second.

5966
04:27:11,520 --> 04:27:11,960
Wait.

5967
04:27:11,980 --> 04:27:13,060
Are they gonna come running this way?

5968
04:27:14,740 --> 04:27:15,680
They won't, right?

5969
04:27:20,240 --> 04:27:20,680
Yeah.

5970
04:27:21,360 --> 04:27:21,800
Okay.

5971
04:27:21,940 --> 04:27:22,280
We're good.

5972
04:27:22,880 --> 04:27:23,320
Okay.

5973
04:27:23,820 --> 04:27:24,400
This way.

5974
04:27:28,300 --> 04:27:29,180
Oh, shoot!

5975
04:27:29,240 --> 04:27:30,000
It's level five!

5976
04:27:31,220 --> 04:27:31,660
Wait.

5977
04:27:31,920 --> 04:27:32,360
Okay.

5978
04:27:32,780 --> 04:27:33,220
Okay.

5979
04:27:34,800 --> 04:27:36,540
Where's my Zone of the Enders box?

5980
04:27:37,820 --> 04:27:39,080
I want my own.

5981
04:27:40,820 --> 04:27:42,980
This section would be a lot cooler with a skateboard.

5982
04:27:43,300 --> 04:27:43,880
I think you're right.

5983
04:27:55,420 --> 04:27:56,460
Oh, wait.

5984
04:27:56,540 --> 04:27:57,540
Did I just go to this...

5985
04:27:58,360 --> 04:27:59,180
side here?

5986
04:28:14,440 --> 04:28:15,860
Leon falls asleep.

5987
04:28:30,140 --> 04:28:31,320
I might be...

5988
04:28:31,320 --> 04:28:33,600
a god gamer sometimes, you guys.

5989
04:28:34,180 --> 04:28:34,860
Oh, wait.

5990
04:28:34,860 --> 04:28:36,020
The sniper guy up here.

5991
04:28:36,140 --> 04:28:37,400
Oh, he'll leave eventually, though.

5992
04:28:38,220 --> 04:28:38,780
I think.

5993
04:28:40,740 --> 04:28:41,880
He leaves eventually.

5994
04:28:42,840 --> 04:28:44,760
Why did I not go to D again earlier?

5995
04:28:45,560 --> 04:28:46,080
Oh, wait.

5996
04:28:46,660 --> 04:28:47,820
I did go to D.

5997
04:28:47,860 --> 04:28:48,860
Because this is the...

5998
04:28:48,860 --> 04:28:50,860
This is the room with the...

5999
04:28:51,880 --> 04:28:52,960
I remember this room.

6000
04:28:53,160 --> 04:28:53,620
Oh, my gosh.

6001
04:28:53,660 --> 04:28:53,860
Wait.

6002
04:28:58,800 --> 04:29:00,060
Is he gonna come up?

6003
04:29:03,620 --> 04:29:05,260
I'm waiting for the other guy to leave, too.

6004
04:29:05,420 --> 04:29:06,080
Not gonna lie.

6005
04:29:06,800 --> 04:29:07,180
Yeah.

6006
04:29:07,180 --> 04:29:08,960
I'm waiting for the sniper guy to...

6007
04:29:08,960 --> 04:29:10,700
to take a nap or...

6008
04:29:10,700 --> 04:29:11,660
Take a...

6009
04:29:11,660 --> 04:29:12,380
Take a walk!

6010
04:29:13,560 --> 04:29:14,480
Take a walk!

6011
04:29:15,200 --> 04:29:16,820
But there's this guy down here.

6012
04:29:17,000 --> 04:29:17,680
Will he hear me?

6013
04:29:17,980 --> 04:29:19,120
Does he come up...

6014
04:29:19,120 --> 04:29:20,040
the stairs?

6015
04:29:23,380 --> 04:29:24,160
Oh, he left.

6016
04:29:29,200 --> 04:29:29,680
Shoot.

6017
04:29:29,860 --> 04:29:30,360
There's two of them.

6018
04:29:32,660 --> 04:29:33,140
Bye.

6019
04:29:36,900 --> 04:29:38,360
Take a hike, bozo.

6020
04:29:40,760 --> 04:29:42,560
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

6021
04:29:43,480 --> 04:29:44,640
Oh, my gosh.

6022
04:29:56,530 --> 04:29:57,830
It's this one over here, right?

6023
04:30:08,470 --> 04:30:08,950
Oh!

6024
04:30:09,590 --> 04:30:10,030
Hahaha.

6025
04:30:14,180 --> 04:30:14,860
I'm here.

6026
04:30:16,300 --> 04:30:17,680
I'm heading on over.

6027
04:30:18,860 --> 04:30:19,340
Oh.

6028
04:30:20,660 --> 04:30:21,140
Ah.

6029
04:30:21,640 --> 04:30:22,900
Oh, I need the sniper.

6030
04:30:23,640 --> 04:30:24,120
Aaaa!

6031
04:30:27,740 --> 04:30:28,900
Can you hear me?

6032
04:30:29,040 --> 04:30:29,240
Yeah.

6033
04:30:29,540 --> 04:30:30,960
Where have you been?

6034
04:30:31,300 --> 04:30:31,900
Checking around.

6035
04:30:32,260 --> 04:30:33,720
I'm in Strade H right now.

6036
04:30:33,800 --> 04:30:33,980
H?

6037
04:30:33,980 --> 04:30:34,300
Wait!

6038
04:30:35,380 --> 04:30:36,480
What if I went over to Strata H?

6039
04:30:40,200 --> 04:30:41,040
First floor.

6040
04:30:45,420 --> 04:30:45,840
Wait!

6041
04:30:59,740 --> 04:31:00,580
Did I?

6042
04:31:00,620 --> 04:31:01,940
I think I was too busy thinking of Johnny.

6043
04:31:03,980 --> 04:31:05,880
Take a look with your binoculars.

6044
04:31:11,040 --> 04:31:11,840
That's them.

6045
04:31:14,000 --> 04:31:16,500
Get a really good look at it.

6046
04:31:18,380 --> 04:31:23,460
I guess Raiden didn't ever set them off.

6047
04:31:23,820 --> 04:31:26,400
It was always Solid Snake that took them out first.

6048
04:31:26,900 --> 04:31:28,180
Do you need a PSG?

6049
04:31:28,620 --> 04:31:29,180
Wait!

6050
04:31:29,720 --> 04:31:31,160
Where do I get the PSG?

6051
04:31:31,240 --> 04:31:31,560
Plissken!

6052
04:31:34,400 --> 04:31:38,360
Don't try to shoot out control units with a handgun when the distance is too great.

6053
04:31:38,580 --> 04:31:40,760
The weapon doesn't have that kind of range.

6054
04:31:41,120 --> 04:31:42,440
Use the sniper rifle.

6055
04:31:42,720 --> 04:31:43,280
Where is it?

6056
04:31:43,460 --> 04:31:46,740
I saw a PSG-1 in the storage room on Strut F.

6057
04:31:46,940 --> 04:31:47,140
No.

6058
04:31:47,200 --> 04:31:49,260
There should be one left, so go and grab it.

6059
04:31:49,380 --> 04:31:49,400
No.

6060
04:31:57,510 --> 04:31:58,590
I hate this game.

6061
04:32:20,260 --> 04:32:20,880
Let's just go.

6062
04:32:21,540 --> 04:32:22,320
Let's just leave.

6063
04:32:23,460 --> 04:32:24,620
No, no, no, no, no, no.

6064
04:32:30,800 --> 04:32:32,340
Back to Strut F.

6065
04:32:35,760 --> 04:32:37,940
At least it's not so difficult.

6066
04:32:40,180 --> 04:32:41,180
Wait, where are we at?

6067
04:32:42,560 --> 04:32:43,520
E, F.

6068
04:32:50,140 --> 04:32:54,640
This is the one with our little sniper friend.

6069
04:32:55,400 --> 04:32:55,880
You.

6070
04:32:56,440 --> 04:32:57,620
You can't see me, eh?

6071
04:32:59,120 --> 04:33:00,180
There's two of them!

6072
04:33:01,060 --> 04:33:02,600
What are you doing up there?

6073
04:33:07,120 --> 04:33:08,760
Since when were there two of them?

6074
04:33:08,840 --> 04:33:11,860
The guy came strolling up as if I wouldn't even notice.

6075
04:33:12,640 --> 04:33:13,680
That's so funny.

6076
04:33:14,400 --> 04:33:15,200
Okay, here I go.

6077
04:33:15,740 --> 04:33:16,560
They're talking.

6078
04:33:17,200 --> 04:33:19,300
They're having a nice little conversation in the middle.

6079
04:33:24,700 --> 04:33:28,180
It did look like he was surrendering for a second.

6080
04:33:31,520 --> 04:33:32,000
Okay.

6081
04:33:33,060 --> 04:33:33,540
Oop.

6082
04:33:35,280 --> 04:33:35,760
Bucks.

6083
04:33:38,540 --> 04:33:40,200
So glad this guy is blind.

6084
04:33:42,420 --> 04:33:43,280
Nothing here.

6085
04:33:45,620 --> 04:33:47,020
Are you gonna look to the left?

6086
04:33:47,400 --> 04:33:48,340
Intruder to the left!

6087
04:33:49,280 --> 04:33:50,260
Intruder to the right!

6088
04:33:54,160 --> 04:33:57,400
At least getting through here is, like, so not bad, you know?

6089
04:33:58,060 --> 04:33:58,660
Hold on.

6090
04:33:58,740 --> 04:33:59,180
I don't wanna...

6091
04:33:59,180 --> 04:33:59,920
There we go.

6092
04:33:59,960 --> 04:34:00,000
Okay.

6093
04:34:00,000 --> 04:34:00,600
I just wanna...

6094
04:34:00,600 --> 04:34:01,800
Just to be on the...

6095
04:34:01,800 --> 04:34:03,420
Erring on the side of caution.

6096
04:34:05,000 --> 04:34:08,220
You can fast travel.

6097
04:34:08,560 --> 04:34:09,300
That's true.

6098
04:34:09,560 --> 04:34:10,040
Oh, yeah.

6099
04:34:10,780 --> 04:34:11,260
But...

6100
04:34:12,660 --> 04:34:14,260
I don't know what boxes I have.

6101
04:34:16,020 --> 04:34:17,780
Oh, to electric appliances.

6102
04:34:19,340 --> 04:34:20,480
Is that where I need to go?

6103
04:34:20,620 --> 04:34:21,320
Daily supplies.

6104
04:34:22,960 --> 04:34:23,760
Action figures?

6105
04:34:25,820 --> 04:34:26,300
Wait.

6106
04:34:26,400 --> 04:34:27,320
What does this one look like?

6107
04:34:27,700 --> 04:34:28,180
Oh.

6108
04:34:28,960 --> 04:34:29,440
Oh.

6109
04:34:29,500 --> 04:34:29,980
Oh.

6110
04:34:30,000 --> 04:34:30,600
Shoot.

6111
04:34:32,340 --> 04:34:33,820
I think all the things are gone, though.

6112
04:34:33,860 --> 04:34:34,320
It's just him.

6113
04:34:36,520 --> 04:34:37,020
Never mind.

6114
04:34:37,160 --> 04:34:37,760
I hear them.

6115
04:34:37,840 --> 04:34:38,400
They're not gone.

6116
04:34:42,360 --> 04:34:42,720
Yeah!

6117
04:34:48,670 --> 04:34:49,270
Oh, my God.

6118
04:34:49,310 --> 04:34:50,050
That was so close.

6119
04:34:51,910 --> 04:34:52,630
Holy cow.

6120
04:34:57,040 --> 04:34:58,020
That was so close.

6121
04:35:00,240 --> 04:35:00,800
Oh, my God.

6122
04:35:00,840 --> 04:35:01,140
Please.

6123
04:35:01,360 --> 04:35:01,720
Please.

6124
04:35:01,840 --> 04:35:02,200
Fingers.

6125
04:35:03,140 --> 04:35:03,660
There we go.

6126
04:35:05,180 --> 04:35:05,540
Okay.

6127
04:35:05,720 --> 04:35:06,080
Okay.

6128
04:35:06,100 --> 04:35:14,080
I think I have to box it.

6129
04:35:14,140 --> 04:35:15,540
He does leave eventually, though.

6130
04:35:15,820 --> 04:35:16,620
Pretty sure.

6131
04:35:17,900 --> 04:35:20,100
Pretty sure he leaves eventually.

6132
04:35:21,740 --> 04:35:23,460
But I need to take these guys out first.

6133
04:35:23,600 --> 04:35:23,900
I do.

6134
04:35:24,760 --> 04:35:26,160
These dang ciphers.

6135
04:35:29,120 --> 04:35:31,860
Why is it always auto-aim to up?

6136
04:35:32,460 --> 04:35:33,140
Can you...

6137
04:35:33,140 --> 04:35:33,940
Right then.

6138
04:35:34,500 --> 04:35:35,000
Okay.

6139
04:35:36,960 --> 04:35:37,400
Let's go.

6140
04:35:37,900 --> 04:35:38,260
Okay.

6141
04:35:38,260 --> 04:35:38,280
Let's go.

6142
04:35:38,520 --> 04:35:38,880
No!

6143
04:35:59,730 --> 04:36:00,290
Oh, shoot.

6144
04:36:00,610 --> 04:36:01,830
I'm actually in trouble now.

6145
04:36:24,240 --> 04:36:25,340
They won't come this way.

6146
04:36:27,140 --> 04:36:27,500
Ouch.

6147
04:36:33,870 --> 04:36:34,230
Ouch.

6148
04:36:34,290 --> 04:36:34,410
Ouch.

6149
04:36:34,410 --> 04:36:34,510
Ouch.

6150
04:36:34,510 --> 04:36:34,630
Ouch.

6151
04:36:34,670 --> 04:36:35,030
Ouch.

6152
04:36:35,030 --> 04:36:35,090
Ouch.

6153
04:36:35,490 --> 04:36:35,850
Ouch.

6154
04:36:35,850 --> 04:36:35,890
Ouch.

6155
04:36:35,950 --> 04:36:35,970
Ouch.

6156
04:36:35,970 --> 04:36:35,990
Ouch.

6157
04:36:35,990 --> 04:36:36,030
Ouch.

6158
04:36:36,030 --> 04:36:36,290
Ouch.

6159
04:36:37,490 --> 04:36:37,850
Ouch.

6160
04:36:52,670 --> 04:36:52,990
Down?

6161
04:36:53,550 --> 04:36:53,870
Down.

6162
04:36:59,970 --> 04:37:01,330
Goodbye, sweet cruel world.

6163
04:37:12,890 --> 04:37:13,670
You know what?

6164
04:37:14,190 --> 04:37:15,390
Sometimes it's just easier.

6165
04:37:17,070 --> 04:37:17,730
Oh, gosh.

6166
04:37:17,850 --> 04:37:19,190
I have to start all the way over here, though.

6167
04:37:19,450 --> 04:37:20,350
I'm so stupid.

6168
04:37:20,430 --> 04:37:22,030
I should have just killed myself from the beginning.

6169
04:37:24,710 --> 04:37:26,110
I'm going out on my own terms.

6170
04:37:27,770 --> 04:37:28,410
Oh, man.

6171
04:37:28,470 --> 04:37:30,550
I have to go all the way back, though, because I'm an idiot.

6172
04:37:31,610 --> 04:37:31,930
Oh, I should have just killed myself from the beginning.

6173
04:37:31,930 --> 04:37:33,370
Oh, these guys are still out.

6174
04:37:47,330 --> 04:37:48,010
Where's the entrance?

6175
04:37:48,230 --> 04:37:48,450
There it is.

6176
04:37:51,630 --> 04:37:52,030
Anyway...

6177
04:37:53,310 --> 04:37:54,650
They slept through the alert.

6178
04:37:55,530 --> 04:37:56,530
Nobody let them know!

6179
04:37:57,090 --> 04:37:57,490
Who?

6180
04:37:57,670 --> 04:37:58,510
Nobody let them know!

6181
04:38:01,070 --> 04:38:02,230
Oh, that's the wrong thing.

6182
04:38:02,570 --> 04:38:02,970
Nothing

6183
04:38:08,270 --> 04:38:11,750
here...

6184
04:38:12,950 --> 04:38:14,830
Alright, we won't get caught this time, guys.

6185
04:38:16,570 --> 04:38:18,370
I'm just like, oh, this way is not so bad!

6186
04:38:18,890 --> 04:38:19,330
Whatever!

6187
04:38:24,000 --> 04:38:24,960
It's not so bad.

6188
04:38:26,760 --> 04:38:27,760
Thank you, thank you.

6189
04:38:31,380 --> 04:38:32,820
Are they all back?

6190
04:38:34,180 --> 04:38:35,660
Are all the things back?

6191
04:38:36,520 --> 04:38:36,960
Yup.

6192
04:38:37,620 --> 04:38:41,820
No, and I have to worry about this guy seeing it too!

6193
04:38:56,300 --> 04:38:58,000
He'll see it if I shoot it.

6194
04:38:58,080 --> 04:38:59,680
Well, only if he's looking in this direction.

6195
04:39:00,060 --> 04:39:00,160
I suppose.

6196
04:39:02,020 --> 04:39:03,080
So like, now.

6197
04:39:03,400 --> 04:39:04,540
He would see it.

6198
04:39:05,320 --> 04:39:05,800
Right?

6199
04:39:07,500 --> 04:39:07,980
No?

6200
04:39:08,460 --> 04:39:09,920
Why did you only see it before?

6201
04:39:13,220 --> 04:39:13,700
What?

6202
04:39:18,590 --> 04:39:19,550
I have a question.

6203
04:39:19,770 --> 04:39:20,650
Will they see...

6204
04:39:21,610 --> 04:39:24,150
I'm too nervous to go because the things will...

6205
04:39:24,150 --> 04:39:25,130
I think they'll see my box.

6206
04:39:27,730 --> 04:39:28,870
We heard the shots.

6207
04:39:28,870 --> 04:39:29,470
But...

6208
04:39:32,750 --> 04:39:34,890
That would make more sense.

6209
04:39:36,950 --> 04:39:38,790
If it was the shots he heard.

6210
04:39:54,820 --> 04:39:56,400
My D key...

6211
04:39:56,400 --> 04:39:56,920
D?

6212
04:39:57,120 --> 04:39:59,380
My square key is acting funky.

6213
04:40:00,120 --> 04:40:01,140
A little bit.

6214
04:40:01,360 --> 04:40:02,380
Did he leave?

6215
04:40:18,230 --> 04:40:18,910
Anyway.

6216
04:40:20,210 --> 04:40:21,590
Pressure sensitive issue?

6217
04:40:21,690 --> 04:40:22,150
I think so.

6218
04:40:23,530 --> 04:40:24,130
So...

6219
04:40:25,250 --> 04:40:25,850
Hmm...

6220
04:40:33,110 --> 04:40:34,170
Top floor?

6221
04:40:34,630 --> 04:40:35,650
Grenade launcher.

6222
04:40:35,690 --> 04:40:36,790
Top left room.

6223
04:40:37,410 --> 04:40:38,890
Middle right room.

6224
04:40:39,190 --> 04:40:39,790
Yes!

6225
04:40:42,250 --> 04:40:44,030
You didn't have to do that.

6226
04:40:44,210 --> 04:40:44,970
You didn't have to...

6227
04:40:44,970 --> 04:40:47,030
You didn't have to tell me where everything is.

6228
04:40:48,370 --> 04:40:50,110
You didn't have to tell me.

6229
04:40:52,390 --> 04:40:53,970
You didn't have to do that.

6230
04:41:02,760 --> 04:41:03,260
See?

6231
04:41:03,480 --> 04:41:05,460
I'm like pushing down on it but it's really...

6232
04:41:05,460 --> 04:41:07,500
It's giving me a hard time.

6233
04:41:07,780 --> 04:41:08,280
No!

6234
04:41:08,340 --> 04:41:08,600
No!

6235
04:41:08,640 --> 04:41:09,420
It's not my fault!

6236
04:41:09,540 --> 04:41:09,740
No!

6237
04:41:09,820 --> 04:41:10,320
My controller!

6238
04:41:11,740 --> 04:41:12,240
No!

6239
04:41:12,360 --> 04:41:12,720
No!

6240
04:41:12,780 --> 04:41:13,020
No!

6241
04:41:13,100 --> 04:41:14,840
My controller is fucking up!

6242
04:41:15,240 --> 04:41:16,000
Oh gosh.

6243
04:41:18,640 --> 04:41:19,140
No!

6244
04:41:19,560 --> 04:41:20,000
No!

6245
04:41:21,320 --> 04:41:23,120
I'm really pushing down on it!

6246
04:41:23,160 --> 04:41:23,580
I am!

6247
04:41:26,930 --> 04:41:27,410
Oh!

6248
04:41:27,530 --> 04:41:27,770
Oh!

6249
04:41:28,290 --> 04:41:29,090
My health!

6250
04:41:32,540 --> 04:41:34,840
It's been a while since I've, like, attached the ration.

6251
04:41:35,260 --> 04:41:36,380
Yeah, I'm bleeding out.

6252
04:41:39,580 --> 04:41:40,060
Oh!

6253
04:41:41,460 --> 04:41:42,740
That one was me.

6254
04:41:46,260 --> 04:41:46,740
Um...

6255
04:41:46,740 --> 04:41:47,620
Okay.

6256
04:41:50,960 --> 04:41:51,440
Okay.

6257
04:41:51,520 --> 04:41:51,960
Alright.

6258
04:41:52,140 --> 04:41:52,900
We got this now.

6259
04:41:58,160 --> 04:42:01,780
I don't know why it's giving me such trouble all of a sudden.

6260
04:42:03,260 --> 04:42:04,080
But it is.

6261
04:42:05,560 --> 04:42:06,140
You know what?

6262
04:42:06,180 --> 04:42:07,540
I think I'm just gonna run for it, though.

6263
04:42:08,920 --> 04:42:09,920
After this guy leaves.

6264
04:42:13,300 --> 04:42:13,700
Nothing.

6265
04:42:14,440 --> 04:42:15,800
I forgot he looked this way.

6266
04:42:18,960 --> 04:42:19,980
This is the run!

6267
04:42:20,540 --> 04:42:20,940
GigaDuckMan!

6268
04:42:22,780 --> 04:42:23,680
You jinxed it!

6269
04:42:25,020 --> 04:42:25,860
You jinxed it.

6270
04:42:30,680 --> 04:42:32,540
Didn't anyone actually use the...

6271
04:42:32,540 --> 04:42:36,580
I think you use the bandage if you can't, like, lay down at the moment.

6272
04:42:36,700 --> 04:42:37,180
You know what I mean?

6273
04:42:38,280 --> 04:42:40,640
If you're just like, oh, I don't have a chance to...

6274
04:42:42,700 --> 04:42:43,500
To use...

6275
04:42:48,320 --> 04:42:49,200
You know what I mean?

6276
04:42:49,200 --> 04:42:50,920
Play more.

6277
04:42:51,620 --> 04:42:52,540
C4.

6278
04:42:53,200 --> 04:42:54,120
C4.

6279
04:42:55,200 --> 04:42:56,120
Um...

6280
04:42:58,140 --> 04:42:59,060
No...

6281
04:43:02,920 --> 04:43:03,840
More C4!

6282
04:43:04,940 --> 04:43:06,080
But no...

6283
04:43:06,840 --> 04:43:07,940
No PSG.

6284
04:43:14,260 --> 04:43:16,200
But there's lockers in here.

6285
04:43:25,540 --> 04:43:25,980
Hmm...

6286
04:43:29,640 --> 04:43:31,540
How fast does he turn around, this guy?

6287
04:43:34,480 --> 04:43:35,940
Too fast for me.

6288
04:43:37,760 --> 04:43:39,280
Oh, now I'm trapped here, too.

6289
04:43:39,440 --> 04:43:40,520
It feels like...

6290
04:43:40,520 --> 04:43:41,860
Oh gosh, I'm scared.

6291
04:43:42,000 --> 04:43:42,820
I'm scared to get him.

6292
04:43:43,920 --> 04:43:45,680
I'm trapped in this room!

6293
04:43:47,300 --> 04:43:47,740
No!

6294
04:43:48,920 --> 04:43:49,740
Where does he go?

6295
04:43:51,500 --> 04:43:52,660
Where is he, actually?

6296
04:43:53,000 --> 04:43:54,320
Okay, that guy goes upstairs.

6297
04:43:55,600 --> 04:43:56,560
Is he coming back?

6298
04:43:56,700 --> 04:43:57,500
This guy over here?

6299
04:43:58,600 --> 04:43:58,880
Huh?

6300
04:43:59,840 --> 04:44:00,780
Oh, here he is.

6301
04:44:00,820 --> 04:44:01,440
He's coming back.

6302
04:44:01,600 --> 04:44:02,120
Now he is.

6303
04:44:05,940 --> 04:44:07,600
My memory did not serve.

6304
04:44:07,800 --> 04:44:08,760
I trusted you!

6305
04:44:13,470 --> 04:44:14,610
One floor down?

6306
04:44:15,850 --> 04:44:16,290
Shoot.

6307
04:44:16,290 --> 04:44:16,970
Wait, no!

6308
04:44:17,210 --> 04:44:18,070
We already went in?

6309
04:44:18,090 --> 04:44:19,190
Is it the same room as before?

6310
04:44:19,590 --> 04:44:20,910
Or is it the one on the left?

6311
04:44:21,930 --> 04:44:22,610
I guess maybe then.

6312
04:44:22,990 --> 04:44:24,270
I'm just gonna box it.

6313
04:44:26,810 --> 04:44:28,030
Once he walks away.

6314
04:44:29,550 --> 04:44:30,830
No, not yet.

6315
04:44:37,500 --> 04:44:38,420
Maybe over here?

6316
04:44:39,080 --> 04:44:39,680
Ah!

6317
04:44:43,560 --> 04:44:43,860
RGB!

6318
04:44:45,580 --> 04:44:46,800
What the heck is this?

6319
04:44:48,500 --> 04:44:49,100
Wait.

6320
04:44:52,480 --> 04:44:53,080
Hello?

6321
04:44:53,080 --> 04:44:54,120
Are you gonna get up there?

6322
04:44:55,660 --> 04:44:56,600
There we go.

6323
04:44:58,920 --> 04:44:59,680
We're a gamer?

6324
04:45:05,660 --> 04:45:06,080
RGB.

6325
04:45:10,320 --> 04:45:11,640
Oh, the grenade launcher!

6326
04:45:12,120 --> 04:45:13,460
The thing you talked about.

6327
04:45:13,640 --> 04:45:14,640
Okay, so we do have to go downstairs.

6328
04:45:17,680 --> 04:45:18,100
Okay.

6329
04:45:18,920 --> 04:45:19,680
Raiden's gaming.

6330
04:45:20,040 --> 04:45:20,660
Oh my gosh.

6331
04:45:20,700 --> 04:45:22,120
I'm just gonna blow everybody up in here.

6332
04:45:26,230 --> 04:45:27,870
That would be kind of awesome though.

6333
04:45:28,010 --> 04:45:28,750
That would be kind of hardcore.

6334
04:45:31,190 --> 04:45:32,010
Not downstairs.

6335
04:45:42,310 --> 04:45:42,750
M4...

6336
04:45:42,750 --> 04:45:45,430
I see

6337
04:45:53,420 --> 04:45:53,620
it.

6338
04:45:54,280 --> 04:45:55,120
I see it.

6339
04:45:57,380 --> 04:45:58,060
What's in there?

6340
04:45:58,940 --> 04:45:59,620
Wait a second.

6341
04:46:03,100 --> 04:46:04,500
Can I shut this off?

6342
04:46:10,330 --> 04:46:11,530
Everybody shield your eyes!

6343
04:46:13,570 --> 04:46:14,250
It hurts.

6344
04:46:14,250 --> 04:46:14,530
It hurts.

6345
04:46:14,670 --> 04:46:15,170
It hurts.

6346
04:46:15,230 --> 04:46:15,650
It hurts.

6347
04:46:15,670 --> 04:46:16,090
It hurts.

6348
04:46:16,090 --> 04:46:16,610
It hurts.

6349
04:46:16,770 --> 04:46:16,870
It hurts.

6350
04:46:16,870 --> 04:46:17,010
It hurts.

6351
04:46:17,890 --> 04:46:18,270
Okay.

6352
04:46:23,650 --> 04:46:24,530
We got the M4.

6353
04:46:28,080 --> 04:46:28,460
And...

6354
04:46:29,360 --> 04:46:30,020
Assault rifle.

6355
04:46:32,320 --> 04:46:33,740
What have I put on their outfit?

6356
04:46:36,260 --> 04:46:36,640
Oh.

6357
04:46:36,700 --> 04:46:37,580
I don't have it anymore.

6358
04:46:37,720 --> 04:46:39,140
What have I put on their outfit?

6359
04:46:40,280 --> 04:46:40,660
Oh.

6360
04:46:40,660 --> 04:46:41,460
I'm still...

6361
04:46:41,460 --> 04:46:42,440
My face is showing.

6362
04:46:43,380 --> 04:46:44,260
What's in here?

6363
04:46:45,660 --> 04:46:46,480
What the?

6364
04:46:49,200 --> 04:46:50,200
It's ammo!

6365
04:46:50,460 --> 04:46:51,640
Why is this in here?

6366
04:46:53,900 --> 04:46:56,600
Why is there PSG ammo in the hole?

6367
04:46:57,360 --> 04:46:58,040
Why is there PSG ammo in the hole?

6368
04:46:59,380 --> 04:47:00,720
Is there PSG in here?

6369
04:47:01,420 --> 04:47:02,100
No.

6370
04:47:02,200 --> 04:47:02,940
M4 ammo.

6371
04:47:05,560 --> 04:47:07,180
Is it upstairs?

6372
04:47:07,980 --> 04:47:09,000
Still confused.

6373
04:47:09,580 --> 04:47:10,240
Still confused.

6374
04:47:11,820 --> 04:47:13,520
World's most secret ammo.

6375
04:47:14,700 --> 04:47:15,280
World's most secret ammo.

6376
04:47:15,280 --> 04:47:15,480
Actually though.

6377
04:47:18,660 --> 04:47:19,640
Nothing here.

6378
04:47:22,480 --> 04:47:23,060
Okay.

6379
04:47:23,160 --> 04:47:24,720
If there's nothing here, you can leave.

6380
04:47:25,020 --> 04:47:25,600
Okay.

6381
04:47:27,720 --> 04:47:28,300
If there's nothing here, you can leave.

6382
04:47:28,300 --> 04:47:28,760
Now go up.

6383
04:47:30,940 --> 04:47:31,520
I

6384
04:47:38,260 --> 04:47:39,520
love being a box.

6385
04:47:39,940 --> 04:47:39,980
I love being a box.

6386
04:47:50,460 --> 04:47:53,440
I'm grabbing everything but what I need.

6387
04:47:54,900 --> 04:47:57,740
I'm literally grabbing everything but what I need right now.

6388
04:47:58,280 --> 04:47:59,020
I'm literally grabbing everything but what I need right now.

6389
04:48:00,580 --> 04:48:01,060
I'm literally grabbing everything but what I need right now.

6390
04:48:01,060 --> 04:48:02,540
There's PSG ammo everywhere!

6391
04:48:14,830 --> 04:48:16,190
It wasn't this room, right?

6392
04:48:16,330 --> 04:48:17,270
What was in here?

6393
04:48:18,250 --> 04:48:20,290
There's just nothing in here.

6394
04:48:20,590 --> 04:48:20,890
Oh wait.

6395
04:48:20,950 --> 04:48:21,390
There's a tunnel.

6396
04:48:22,590 --> 04:48:23,650
There is something here.

6397
04:48:23,830 --> 04:48:24,390
Hold on.

6398
04:48:24,390 --> 04:48:27,830
I swear if there's PSG ammo at the end of this, I'm going to scream.

6399
04:48:28,770 --> 04:48:29,310
I swear if there's PSG ammo at the end of this, I'm going to scream.

6400
04:48:34,650 --> 04:48:35,050
Oh!

6401
04:48:35,170 --> 04:48:35,990
This is that way!

6402
04:48:37,010 --> 04:48:37,410
Oh!

6403
04:48:37,890 --> 04:48:39,390
This is that way!

6404
04:48:39,390 --> 04:48:39,530
Wait.

6405
04:48:39,570 --> 04:48:39,890
Am I downstairs?

6406
04:48:45,020 --> 04:48:46,060
Don't look this way.

6407
04:48:48,960 --> 04:48:50,120
Am I downstairs now?

6408
04:48:54,140 --> 04:48:54,540
Interesting.

6409
04:49:04,460 --> 04:49:05,580
I think that's it!

6410
04:49:05,780 --> 04:49:05,860
I think that's it!

6411
04:49:06,560 --> 04:49:06,660
Yippee!

6412
04:49:09,120 --> 04:49:09,680
Wait.

6413
04:49:09,780 --> 04:49:10,400
I'm still upstairs.

6414
04:49:10,740 --> 04:49:11,940
Where the hell am I?

6415
04:49:13,700 --> 04:49:14,840
Where am I?

6416
04:49:16,340 --> 04:49:16,900
Okay.

6417
04:49:20,960 --> 04:49:23,580
I'm going to go collect all that stuff though first.

6418
04:49:28,340 --> 04:49:29,460
Nothing here.

6419
04:49:30,440 --> 04:49:31,000
Wait.

6420
04:49:31,180 --> 04:49:32,660
I bet there's ammo in there.

6421
04:49:33,380 --> 04:49:34,260
Here I go.

6422
04:49:34,460 --> 04:49:35,520
I gotta go check.

6423
04:49:37,000 --> 04:49:37,680
What's this?

6424
04:49:39,520 --> 04:49:40,280
Oh!

6425
04:49:42,180 --> 04:49:43,920
Shut up!

6426
04:49:44,980 --> 04:49:47,180
We got a tranquilizer version!

6427
04:49:48,100 --> 04:49:48,360
We got a tranquilizer version!

6428
04:49:48,380 --> 04:49:49,140
Yo!

6429
04:49:50,180 --> 04:49:52,360
I had no idea that was here.

6430
04:49:53,060 --> 04:49:55,000
I had no idea that was here.

6431
04:49:55,000 --> 04:49:55,500
Nothing here.

6432
04:49:55,680 --> 04:49:56,880
My treasure is here.

6433
04:49:59,040 --> 04:50:00,000
Let's go!

6434
04:50:01,240 --> 04:50:01,320
Let's go!

6435
04:50:02,180 --> 04:50:04,080
We'll wait for this guy to leave.

6436
04:50:05,220 --> 04:50:05,980
We'll wait for this guy to leave.

6437
04:50:13,300 --> 04:50:17,000
I'm just going to go back around actually.

6438
04:50:17,180 --> 04:50:18,640
I'm just going to go back through here.

6439
04:50:18,900 --> 04:50:20,900
I know some of you might be saying, Why?

6440
04:50:21,400 --> 04:50:22,880
Because I also want to get that ammo.

6441
04:50:24,300 --> 04:50:25,060
But also...

6442
04:50:29,000 --> 04:50:29,380
Because...

6443
04:50:32,500 --> 04:50:34,400
I feel safer the other way.

6444
04:50:38,100 --> 04:50:39,320
That guy is below us.

6445
04:50:39,460 --> 04:50:39,500
Yeah.

6446
04:50:40,460 --> 04:50:40,940
Here.

6447
04:50:41,720 --> 04:50:42,680
Get that ammo.

6448
04:50:43,440 --> 04:50:44,180
There we go.

6449
04:50:49,640 --> 04:50:50,620
Don't come this way.

6450
04:50:58,000 --> 04:50:58,640
No one.

6451
04:51:00,980 --> 04:51:01,700
It's the enemy.

6452
04:51:01,900 --> 04:51:02,420
I need help.

6453
04:51:03,020 --> 04:51:03,620
I understand.

6454
04:51:03,860 --> 04:51:05,440
It's the first one.

6455
04:51:07,120 --> 04:51:08,240
Surround where I see.

6456
04:51:32,460 --> 04:51:32,860
While...

6457
04:51:36,980 --> 04:51:38,380
While the security...

6458
04:51:38,380 --> 04:51:40,420
While the caution goes down, I'm going to go grab some tea real quick.

6459
04:51:40,640 --> 04:51:41,460
What time is it?

6460
04:51:41,720 --> 04:51:42,300
Oh my gosh!

6461
04:51:42,320 --> 04:51:43,460
It's almost been five hours!

6462
04:51:49,840 --> 04:51:51,540
I have to stop soon though.

6463
04:51:51,540 --> 04:51:54,040
Well, I can maybe go shoot those bombs.

6464
04:51:54,180 --> 04:51:54,860
And then...

6465
04:52:00,320 --> 04:52:02,100
Maybe I'll shoot the bombs next time.

6466
04:52:03,080 --> 04:52:03,680
Holy cow!

6467
04:52:04,580 --> 04:52:05,920
Let's let this caution run out.

6468
04:52:06,160 --> 04:52:07,600
Like I said, I'm going to be right back.

6469
04:52:07,720 --> 04:52:08,400
I'm going to grab some tea.

6470
04:52:14,160 --> 04:52:15,800
You know what comes after the bombs.

6471
04:52:15,880 --> 04:52:16,200
I know!

6472
04:52:16,260 --> 04:52:17,080
That's why I'm like...

6473
04:52:17,080 --> 04:52:19,660
Maybe I will save the bombs for next time.

6474
04:52:19,800 --> 04:52:21,520
Because I think I don't want to get caught.

6475
04:52:21,540 --> 04:52:23,160
In um...

6476
04:52:23,160 --> 04:52:25,580
In whatever might happen.

6477
04:52:26,040 --> 04:52:26,780
Wink wink.

6478
04:52:27,480 --> 04:52:28,020
Wink.

6479
04:52:30,350 --> 04:52:33,690
We can save that special iconic scene for...

6480
04:52:35,140 --> 04:52:36,050
Next time I think.

6481
04:52:36,370 --> 04:52:37,190
Okay, BRB.

6482
04:53:44,010 --> 04:53:45,350
Are you in here with me?

6483
04:53:45,970 --> 04:53:46,870
Don't sniff that.

6484
04:53:48,450 --> 04:53:49,130
Come here.

6485
04:53:50,050 --> 04:53:50,770
Come here.

6486
04:53:50,850 --> 04:53:51,410
Come here.

6487
04:53:51,410 --> 04:53:51,690
Come here.

6488
04:53:52,170 --> 04:53:52,850
Come here.

6489
04:53:58,410 --> 04:53:58,910
Little girl.

6490
04:54:00,070 --> 04:54:02,490
You want to be in my chair?

6491
04:54:04,090 --> 04:54:04,470
No!

6492
04:54:05,390 --> 04:54:06,990
She got out of my chair.

6493
04:54:08,090 --> 04:54:08,670
I'm back.

6494
04:54:12,330 --> 04:54:12,910
Okay.

6495
04:54:14,930 --> 04:54:15,690
Anyway.

6496
04:54:18,370 --> 04:54:19,790
Nothing here.

6497
04:54:22,030 --> 04:54:23,550
Nothing here.

6498
04:54:25,670 --> 04:54:26,690
Wasn't that so silly?

6499
04:54:27,090 --> 04:54:27,850
Everybody?

6500
04:54:28,630 --> 04:54:30,390
Wasn't that such a silly occurrence?

6501
04:54:30,810 --> 04:54:31,310
Oh my gosh.

6502
04:54:31,890 --> 04:54:32,970
That guy has hawk eyes.

6503
04:54:33,250 --> 04:54:34,790
That guy... I think he...

6504
04:54:34,790 --> 04:54:37,570
I think he saw what he shouldn't have seen.

6505
04:54:41,450 --> 04:54:43,250
That guy's vision is too good.

6506
04:54:43,910 --> 04:54:45,030
Gotta take him out.

6507
04:54:46,250 --> 04:54:48,350
Yeah, he is wall hacking for real.

6508
04:54:49,250 --> 04:54:49,810
Wait.

6509
04:54:49,930 --> 04:54:51,530
Does he turn around or...

6510
04:54:52,610 --> 04:54:53,770
No, he walks down.

6511
04:54:53,990 --> 04:54:54,190
Okay.

6512
04:54:54,310 --> 04:54:55,010
This is my chance.

6513
04:55:00,940 --> 04:55:01,820
We did it!

6514
04:55:02,160 --> 04:55:02,660
Yippee!

6515
04:55:04,280 --> 04:55:06,160
Those boxes you see from the vent?

6516
04:55:06,280 --> 04:55:08,160
The logo is McFarlane Toys.

6517
04:55:08,240 --> 04:55:08,380
Oh!

6518
04:55:08,660 --> 04:55:09,100
It is!

6519
04:55:10,380 --> 04:55:13,480
Yeah, I do know their figures are really ugly.

6520
04:55:15,700 --> 04:55:16,300
Affectionate.

6521
04:55:17,880 --> 04:55:18,740
There he is.

6522
04:55:28,760 --> 04:55:30,020
I think all the...

6523
04:55:30,700 --> 04:55:31,640
ciphers are gone.

6524
04:55:31,940 --> 04:55:32,860
So I think we're good.

6525
04:55:33,580 --> 04:55:36,860
They were okay at the moment.

6526
04:55:37,460 --> 04:55:38,560
They were...

6527
04:55:39,580 --> 04:55:40,520
They were...

6528
04:55:43,880 --> 04:55:44,860
They just have...

6529
04:55:45,780 --> 04:55:47,280
They just look...

6530
04:55:48,620 --> 04:55:49,420
They just...

6531
04:55:49,420 --> 04:55:50,900
Are we going for the bombs or not?

6532
04:55:51,000 --> 04:55:51,140
Oh!

6533
04:55:51,180 --> 04:55:51,540
You're right!

6534
04:55:52,300 --> 04:55:55,200
I'm going to go to there and I'm going to save at there.

6535
04:55:55,480 --> 04:55:56,300
So that...

6536
04:55:57,400 --> 04:55:59,580
When I start the game, we're right there.

6537
04:55:59,740 --> 04:56:00,240
You know what I mean?

6538
04:56:01,380 --> 04:56:02,380
So I'm gonna go there.

6539
04:56:03,600 --> 04:56:04,620
And we're gonna save.

6540
04:56:05,860 --> 04:56:07,180
Right outside the door.

6541
04:56:13,440 --> 04:56:14,160
Nothing here.

6542
04:56:14,760 --> 04:56:15,120
Right!

6543
04:56:20,380 --> 04:56:21,380
Oh, not yet.

6544
04:56:22,340 --> 04:56:23,260
Not right here.

6545
04:56:26,700 --> 04:56:29,100
We're gonna have to wait for this guy to take a nap again.

6546
04:56:31,280 --> 04:56:32,000
Our little...

6547
04:56:34,100 --> 04:56:34,820
Our little...

6548
04:56:34,820 --> 04:56:36,080
Our little sniper man.

6549
04:56:37,000 --> 04:56:38,300
Oh wait, there's two of them there.

6550
04:56:38,460 --> 04:56:39,980
Oh yeah, I forgot that there's two of them.

6551
04:56:40,600 --> 04:56:42,180
We can wait for both of them to leave.

6552
04:56:42,320 --> 04:56:42,680
They'll go.

6553
04:56:43,860 --> 04:56:44,220
Sometime.

6554
04:56:45,120 --> 04:56:45,960
Some point...

6555
04:56:45,960 --> 04:56:46,560
There, he leaves.

6556
04:56:46,940 --> 04:56:49,360
I could...

6557
04:56:49,360 --> 04:56:50,340
They're stylized.

6558
04:56:54,940 --> 04:56:56,060
Did I miss fat man?

6559
04:56:56,200 --> 04:56:56,880
Yeah, I'm sorry.

6560
04:56:59,100 --> 04:57:00,000
Get out of here.

6561
04:57:00,420 --> 04:57:00,860
Go.

6562
04:57:01,200 --> 04:57:01,640
Go.

6563
04:57:03,020 --> 04:57:03,900
Stop staring.

6564
04:57:10,180 --> 04:57:12,160
Sorry, I know I could go and like...

6565
04:57:12,160 --> 04:57:13,800
Wait, this guy comes back.

6566
04:57:17,160 --> 04:57:17,920
Excuse me.

6567
04:57:19,080 --> 04:57:20,000
Take a hike.

6568
04:57:20,740 --> 04:57:21,780
No stretching.

6569
04:57:21,900 --> 04:57:22,860
On the job.

6570
04:57:23,940 --> 04:57:24,460
Gosh.

6571
04:57:25,600 --> 04:57:27,000
These guys are ridiculous.

6572
04:57:27,260 --> 04:57:30,540
They just act like there's nobody to worry about over here.

6573
04:57:30,640 --> 04:57:30,800
You know?

6574
04:57:35,940 --> 04:57:37,720
Okay, now we get through strut D.

6575
04:57:37,840 --> 04:57:39,060
What are you doing, Pies?

6576
04:57:39,760 --> 04:57:41,280
She's being a curious girl.

6577
04:57:42,140 --> 04:57:43,820
She's being a little curious cat.

6578
04:57:45,520 --> 04:57:46,840
As she does.

6579
04:57:53,080 --> 04:57:53,840
And through.

6580
04:57:53,940 --> 04:57:54,340
Okay.

6581
04:57:55,420 --> 04:57:57,000
Now I can save.

6582
04:57:59,520 --> 04:58:01,020
Shell one, shell two connecting.

6583
04:58:01,180 --> 04:58:01,860
Bridge, baby.

6584
04:58:05,060 --> 04:58:06,180
Let's talk to Plissken.

6585
04:58:08,960 --> 04:58:12,480
Don't try to shoot out control units with a handgun when the distance is too great.

6586
04:58:12,480 --> 04:58:13,260
Oh yeah, he told me this.

6587
04:58:13,480 --> 04:58:14,740
Thanks to the stream boss, but through.

6588
04:58:15,520 --> 04:58:16,820
Use the sniper rifle.

6589
04:58:17,600 --> 04:58:20,880
Use the PSG-1 to take out those control units.

6590
04:58:23,280 --> 04:58:23,800
Okay.

6591
04:58:28,500 --> 04:58:30,900
Right, and what you see there is a booby trap.

6592
04:58:31,640 --> 04:58:32,820
Colonel said booby.

6593
04:58:34,340 --> 04:58:38,160
The Semtex will detonate if the IR beam from the sensor is disturbed.

6594
04:58:38,380 --> 04:58:41,300
Whatever you do, don't touch the IR beam.

6595
04:58:41,940 --> 04:58:44,860
But there's no way to get through there without crossing the beam.

6596
04:58:44,920 --> 04:58:45,180
Good.

6597
04:58:45,980 --> 04:58:48,480
Neutralize all the control units for the IR sensor.

6598
04:58:49,260 --> 04:58:53,220
Those control units and the distance are obviously out of handgun range.

6599
04:58:53,680 --> 04:58:54,540
What do I do then?

6600
04:58:54,660 --> 04:58:56,920
Use the sniper rifle to take them out.

6601
04:58:56,980 --> 04:58:57,500
I got it.

6602
04:58:57,600 --> 04:59:02,100
Use the PSG-1 sniper rifle to shoot out control units that are farther away.

6603
04:59:03,900 --> 04:59:05,640
Booby was never part of the simulation.

6604
04:59:06,000 --> 04:59:06,440
Alright, Rose.

6605
04:59:08,420 --> 04:59:09,800
What can I do for you, Jack?

6606
04:59:10,140 --> 04:59:11,180
I'm just saving.

6607
04:59:11,400 --> 04:59:12,340
And then I'm gonna quit.

6608
04:59:12,340 --> 04:59:12,560
And then I'm gonna quit.

6609
04:59:17,040 --> 04:59:17,520
Gosh.

6610
04:59:19,000 --> 04:59:19,480
Already...

6611
04:59:20,200 --> 04:59:20,680
What?

6612
04:59:22,200 --> 04:59:23,580
Almost nine hours.

6613
04:59:23,940 --> 04:59:25,660
I'm so slow with this game.

6614
04:59:25,740 --> 04:59:27,240
Thank you guys for being patient with me.

6615
04:59:27,280 --> 04:59:29,960
Jack, I know you're probably doing fine, but don't get discouraged.

6616
04:59:30,460 --> 04:59:33,060
Remember, Lieutenant JG Plissken is with you too.

6617
04:59:33,280 --> 04:59:33,940
You'll be alright.

6618
04:59:36,140 --> 04:59:37,280
Salute to the solid mental.

6619
04:59:37,760 --> 04:59:38,100
Salute to the solid mental.

6620
04:59:38,100 --> 04:59:38,980
Don't give me that.

6621
04:59:39,260 --> 04:59:41,460
Every time you say nothing, it's always something.

6622
04:59:41,720 --> 04:59:42,220
What's wrong?

6623
04:59:44,760 --> 04:59:46,100
You seem to think pretty highly of me.

6624
04:59:47,420 --> 04:59:50,680
Yeah, Plissken's the kind of guy you can really depend on, isn't he?

6625
04:59:52,260 --> 04:59:52,700
What?

6626
04:59:54,460 --> 04:59:56,940
Yeah, Plissken is one heck of a man, isn't he?

6627
04:59:57,200 --> 04:59:58,940
He's so cool, so confident.

6628
05:00:00,100 --> 05:00:00,540
What's up with this guy?

6629
05:00:01,420 --> 05:00:04,020
But he's nowhere near as cool as you.

6630
05:00:04,200 --> 05:00:06,040
He'll always be my number one.

6631
05:00:06,520 --> 05:00:07,560
What's up with this guy?

6632
05:00:07,700 --> 05:00:09,180
But that's not what I meant.

6633
05:00:10,020 --> 05:00:12,360
You know, you're kinda cute sometimes.

6634
05:00:12,860 --> 05:00:13,560
Bye, Jack.

6635
05:00:15,620 --> 05:00:17,160
She loves her tsundere boyfriend.

6636
05:00:19,720 --> 05:00:22,100
So next time, we'll take these out.

6637
05:00:27,150 --> 05:00:28,490
Wait, how do I use this again?

6638
05:00:29,470 --> 05:00:30,190
Zoom it up.

6639
05:00:32,190 --> 05:00:33,570
Sons of Liberty!

6640
05:00:38,790 --> 05:00:40,030
How do I see it, though?

6641
05:00:43,130 --> 05:00:44,570
Wait, if I crouch...

6642
05:00:44,570 --> 05:00:44,650
Wait, if I crouch...

6643
05:00:44,650 --> 05:00:47,070
I wish I could crouch with the thing, you know?

6644
05:00:48,610 --> 05:00:50,150
That's it right there, isn't it?

6645
05:00:51,510 --> 05:00:52,770
And we have...

6646
05:00:52,770 --> 05:00:53,350
How many are there?

6647
05:00:53,710 --> 05:00:54,430
Two...

6648
05:00:59,930 --> 05:01:00,650
Three...

6649
05:01:02,030 --> 05:01:02,750
Four...

6650
05:01:04,290 --> 05:01:05,010
Five...

6651
05:01:09,730 --> 05:01:10,450
Six...

6652
05:01:14,470 --> 05:01:15,730
Sons of Liberty!

6653
05:01:16,150 --> 05:01:17,410
Sons of Liberty!

6654
05:01:18,410 --> 05:01:21,870
I'm hoping that you would complete the game in under 30 minutes, but I think we're pretty close to that mark.

6655
05:01:25,470 --> 05:01:26,590
Yeah, we're so close.

6656
05:01:27,390 --> 05:01:28,710
No, I think I have...

6657
05:01:28,710 --> 05:01:30,290
I mean, I know I have quite a ways to go.

6658
05:01:31,350 --> 05:01:32,030
But that's okay.

6659
05:01:32,990 --> 05:01:34,190
This kind of game...

6660
05:01:34,950 --> 05:01:36,410
There's so much going on.

6661
05:01:36,550 --> 05:01:39,090
So I don't mind taking it a little bit more slowly.

6662
05:01:42,890 --> 05:01:43,930
238 is my record.

6663
05:01:44,050 --> 05:01:44,770
Holy cow.

6664
05:01:46,190 --> 05:01:47,490
But I get...

6665
05:01:47,490 --> 05:01:49,110
I feel like the more I play...

6666
05:01:49,110 --> 05:01:50,650
I mean, each time I play, like...

6667
05:01:50,650 --> 05:01:52,850
I haven't beat this game very many times.

6668
05:01:53,210 --> 05:01:53,610
And...

6669
05:01:54,450 --> 05:01:56,790
But I get a little bit more used to it.

6670
05:01:57,030 --> 05:01:57,730
Every time.

6671
05:01:57,850 --> 05:01:58,730
So, you know.

6672
05:02:00,990 --> 05:02:02,510
Happy I can catch a stream on my birthday!

6673
05:02:02,630 --> 05:02:02,950
Oh my gosh!

6674
05:02:03,110 --> 05:02:03,510
Jack!

6675
05:02:03,930 --> 05:02:04,690
Happy birthday!

6676
05:02:06,010 --> 05:02:07,570
Thank you for streaming my favorite game.

6677
05:02:07,930 --> 05:02:08,610
What's up, Jack?

6678
05:02:10,430 --> 05:02:11,010
What is that?

6679
05:02:11,050 --> 05:02:11,190
Flag?

6680
05:02:11,730 --> 05:02:13,130
It's the Sons of Liberty flag.

6681
05:02:13,730 --> 05:02:14,130
See?

6682
05:02:14,770 --> 05:02:15,850
Sons of Liberty!

6683
05:02:18,130 --> 05:02:20,990
I love that the flag in the other room...

6684
05:02:20,990 --> 05:02:21,470
is backwards.

6685
05:02:22,110 --> 05:02:23,910
And we gotta take out that guy too.

6686
05:02:27,290 --> 05:02:28,450
Little Cipher...

6687
05:02:29,950 --> 05:02:31,110
Little Cipher...

6688
05:02:32,490 --> 05:02:33,650
Little Cipher...

6689
05:02:34,550 --> 05:02:35,350
Little Cipher...

6690
05:02:35,350 --> 05:02:35,990
Little Cipher...

6691
05:02:37,270 --> 05:02:38,210
Am I wrong?

6692
05:02:38,310 --> 05:02:40,150
Or can he move the flag with the second controller?

6693
05:02:44,770 --> 05:02:45,370
I don't think you can.

6694
05:02:46,490 --> 05:02:47,710
Wait, with second control?

6695
05:02:47,830 --> 05:02:48,950
With a second controller?

6696
05:02:49,110 --> 05:02:52,670
If I plugged in a second controller right now...

6697
05:02:52,670 --> 05:02:53,770
I'd be able to control it?

6698
05:02:54,570 --> 05:02:55,370
Oh, sorry.

6699
05:02:57,130 --> 05:02:57,970
Good job, Jack.

6700
05:02:58,710 --> 05:02:59,510
I mean, Raiden.

6701
05:03:00,410 --> 05:03:01,790
My name is Raiden.

6702
05:03:01,890 --> 05:03:03,070
Code name Raiden.

6703
05:03:04,530 --> 05:03:06,430
I'm gonna go out with a bag!

6704
05:03:06,810 --> 05:03:07,630
I did save, right?

6705
05:03:13,760 --> 05:03:15,120
What can I do for you, Jack?

6706
05:03:16,560 --> 05:03:17,600
I did save...

6707
05:03:17,600 --> 05:03:17,780
Yeah.

6708
05:03:18,660 --> 05:03:20,180
What are you doing, little girl?

6709
05:03:20,440 --> 05:03:21,560
Why are you running all around?

6710
05:03:21,900 --> 05:03:23,280
She wanted into my room so bad.

6711
05:03:26,780 --> 05:03:28,540
Wonder if she'll say anything else, though.

6712
05:03:33,060 --> 05:03:33,480
Yes!

6713
05:03:34,800 --> 05:03:36,920
This is why I always try to save...

6714
05:03:36,920 --> 05:03:38,420
as much as possible in this game.

6715
05:03:40,380 --> 05:03:40,800
Yeah!

6716
05:03:40,980 --> 05:03:41,620
Because I'm curious.

6717
05:03:42,180 --> 05:03:43,400
More so than before.

6718
05:03:43,460 --> 05:03:45,080
Does it really bother you that much?

6719
05:03:47,160 --> 05:03:47,780
You don't want to say.

6720
05:03:47,940 --> 05:03:48,640
Like what?

6721
05:03:48,940 --> 05:03:51,560
You know, those things you don't want to say.

6722
05:03:51,760 --> 05:03:53,260
Those things you don't want to say?

6723
05:03:53,640 --> 05:03:55,400
Things you don't want to say.

6724
05:03:55,840 --> 05:03:58,140
Like that you've been married before?

6725
05:03:58,420 --> 05:03:59,880
That you're 80 years old?

6726
05:04:00,020 --> 05:04:01,200
That you used to be a woman?

6727
05:04:01,300 --> 05:04:04,800
What exactly is it you won't tell me?

6728
05:04:04,920 --> 05:04:06,760
Do you think I'd hate you if I knew?

6729
05:04:07,080 --> 05:04:09,220
Do you really have that little faith in me?

6730
05:04:09,220 --> 05:04:10,080
Pineapple on pizza?

6731
05:04:10,420 --> 05:04:12,140
No, it's nothing like that.

6732
05:04:12,420 --> 05:04:13,560
Then what is it?

6733
05:04:13,680 --> 05:04:14,180
Give it up already.

6734
05:04:18,180 --> 05:04:19,300
That's why his hair is white.

6735
05:04:19,300 --> 05:04:20,840
The fact that there's a side of you I don't know.

6736
05:04:21,140 --> 05:04:23,860
Sometimes I just can't help myself.

6737
05:04:24,280 --> 05:04:25,420
You've got me right now.

6738
05:04:25,960 --> 05:04:26,900
Isn't that enough?

6739
05:04:27,220 --> 05:04:28,140
No, it's not.

6740
05:04:28,500 --> 05:04:29,320
I'm sorry.

6741
05:04:29,460 --> 05:04:31,080
I know I'm being greedy but...

6742
05:04:31,080 --> 05:04:31,780
Nose.

6743
05:04:32,400 --> 05:04:33,660
She does not nose.

6744
05:04:35,000 --> 05:04:35,880
The size.

6745
05:04:38,780 --> 05:04:39,260
Rose!

6746
05:04:40,180 --> 05:04:42,560
This is a life or death situation out here.

6747
05:04:42,600 --> 05:04:45,160
While you're in your cushy little cozy room.

6748
05:04:45,160 --> 05:04:47,300
We are just in front of a monitor.

6749
05:04:47,560 --> 05:04:49,220
I am fighting for my life.

6750
05:04:49,300 --> 05:04:51,080
And you're not helping my mental situation.

6751
05:04:53,920 --> 05:04:55,120
Gosh, I love them.

6752
05:04:55,380 --> 05:04:56,700
Oh, I love...

6753
05:04:56,700 --> 05:04:58,220
I eat it up.

6754
05:04:58,240 --> 05:04:58,740
I eat it up.

6755
05:04:59,000 --> 05:05:00,480
This one's for you, Rose.

6756
05:05:01,540 --> 05:05:02,020
Oh.

6757
05:05:03,880 --> 05:05:04,360
Oh.

6758
05:05:06,400 --> 05:05:06,880
Oh.

6759
05:05:07,960 --> 05:05:08,360
Oh.

6760
05:05:08,360 --> 05:05:11,620
Use the first person view or the sniper scope to look around.

6761
05:05:14,140 --> 05:05:16,140
Colonel, please just let me kill myself.

6762
05:05:16,460 --> 05:05:19,420
What the

6763
05:05:24,720 --> 05:05:25,320
hell happened?

6764
05:05:25,820 --> 05:05:26,380
Right.

6765
05:05:26,780 --> 05:05:27,760
Right at...

6766
05:05:28,940 --> 05:05:29,500
Yay!

6767
05:05:30,980 --> 05:05:32,020
Now we can exit.

6768
05:05:34,220 --> 05:05:37,800
I tried to do a cool flip into the...

6769
05:05:38,600 --> 05:05:39,400
Oh well.

6770
05:05:39,920 --> 05:05:41,200
That one's for you, Rose.

6771
05:05:41,600 --> 05:05:42,580
Oh, my eyes!

6772
05:05:43,660 --> 05:05:43,780
Right.

6773
05:05:46,280 --> 05:05:50,080
Thank you guys for joining me for part two of MGS2.

6774
05:05:52,420 --> 05:05:53,460
Next time...

6775
05:05:53,460 --> 05:05:55,240
I don't know how far we'll get.

6776
05:05:56,940 --> 05:05:57,460
Maybe...

6777
05:05:58,880 --> 05:06:00,320
Two more streams?

6778
05:06:00,600 --> 05:06:01,860
I don't know, actually.

6779
05:06:04,840 --> 05:06:06,700
How much more do we have?

6780
05:06:08,880 --> 05:06:10,700
We have what's coming up in a second.

6781
05:06:11,080 --> 05:06:13,480
I won't be able to catch streams for a while.

6782
05:06:13,960 --> 05:06:15,600
Since I'm leaving on a European cruise.

6783
05:06:15,680 --> 05:06:15,900
Berlin!

6784
05:06:17,280 --> 05:06:19,320
I just want to wish you a happy anniversary.

6785
05:06:19,320 --> 05:06:20,380
Since I'm going to miss it.

6786
05:06:20,640 --> 05:06:21,760
Hope you have a great time.

6787
05:06:22,820 --> 05:06:23,540
Thank you!

6788
05:06:25,720 --> 05:06:26,920
I hope you have fun as well.

6789
05:06:27,080 --> 05:06:27,580
Oh, hold on.

6790
05:06:27,700 --> 05:06:30,640
I got to not do this because it gets my stream copyrighted.

6791
05:06:31,900 --> 05:06:33,840
It gets my stream copyrighted.

6792
05:06:35,100 --> 05:06:37,480
I hope you have a great time on your cruise.

6793
05:06:37,940 --> 05:06:38,600
Oh, my gosh.

6794
05:06:40,360 --> 05:06:40,720
Yeah.

6795
05:06:40,720 --> 05:06:43,180
Thanks for the auto-soup.

6796
05:06:43,180 --> 05:06:44,280
I really appreciate it.

6797
05:06:45,620 --> 05:06:51,230
One of my favorite parts of this game.

6798
05:06:51,330 --> 05:06:53,250
Riding on a world-changing life or death mission.

6799
05:06:53,490 --> 05:06:55,850
This is the perfect time to talk about us.

6800
05:06:56,050 --> 05:06:56,550
I know.

6801
05:06:56,650 --> 05:06:57,410
It's so great.

6802
05:07:00,190 --> 05:07:00,630
Yeah.

6803
05:07:01,090 --> 05:07:02,270
What else do I have?

6804
05:07:02,430 --> 05:07:03,470
I'm trying to think of the order.

6805
05:07:03,990 --> 05:07:06,390
We do what's coming up next.

6806
05:07:07,110 --> 05:07:08,270
That is not Solid Snake.

6807
05:07:08,270 --> 05:07:09,850
Um...

6808
05:07:09,850 --> 05:07:12,290
We have...

6809
05:07:12,290 --> 05:07:13,410
The President.

6810
05:07:14,120 --> 05:07:15,370
We have...

6811
05:07:15,820 --> 05:07:17,570
Swimmy Swim Swim Time.

6812
05:07:18,690 --> 05:07:20,550
We have...

6813
05:07:20,550 --> 05:07:22,850
Another Sniper Time.

6814
05:07:23,130 --> 05:07:24,660
We have...

6815
05:07:28,050 --> 05:07:29,070
Naked?

6816
05:07:30,130 --> 05:07:31,290
Oh, no.

6817
05:07:31,350 --> 05:07:31,550
Wait.

6818
05:07:31,630 --> 05:07:32,530
I'm missing...

6819
05:07:32,530 --> 05:07:33,310
Oh, we have...

6820
05:07:33,820 --> 05:07:35,530
We have a guy.

6821
05:07:35,850 --> 05:07:37,510
That is...

6822
05:07:38,270 --> 05:07:39,370
I'm trying not to say names, you guys.

6823
05:07:39,430 --> 05:07:40,430
I'm trying not to say names.

6824
05:07:40,730 --> 05:07:41,090
Stop.

6825
05:07:41,190 --> 05:07:41,350
Stop.

6826
05:07:41,490 --> 05:07:41,690
Stop.

6827
05:07:41,790 --> 05:07:41,990
Stop.

6828
05:07:42,010 --> 05:07:42,230
Stop.

6829
05:07:43,430 --> 05:07:44,870
I'm trying to be spoiler free.

6830
05:07:46,530 --> 05:07:47,330
I skipped...

6831
05:07:47,330 --> 05:07:48,990
I skipped a...

6832
05:07:51,430 --> 05:07:51,830
Yes.

6833
05:07:52,490 --> 05:07:52,810
But, yes.

6834
05:07:52,850 --> 05:07:53,730
We have a...

6835
05:07:54,870 --> 05:07:55,890
We have a guy.

6836
05:07:56,010 --> 05:07:57,110
That is a little slippery.

6837
05:07:58,670 --> 05:07:59,890
Then we have...

6838
05:08:00,750 --> 05:08:01,930
Then we have...

6839
05:08:03,050 --> 05:08:03,670
Sniper Time.

6840
05:08:04,270 --> 05:08:05,470
Then we have...

6841
05:08:07,570 --> 05:08:08,350
Naked Time.

6842
05:08:10,250 --> 05:08:10,650
Naked Time.

6843
05:08:10,650 --> 05:08:11,870
Then we have...

6844
05:08:12,790 --> 05:08:13,590
Crazy Time.

6845
05:08:15,510 --> 05:08:16,590
Then we have...

6846
05:08:16,590 --> 05:08:17,710
Let Her Rip Time.

6847
05:08:19,770 --> 05:08:20,350
Then we have...

6848
05:08:20,350 --> 05:08:21,190
Potentially you could finish next stream.

6849
05:08:21,290 --> 05:08:23,630
Now that I'm thinking about it, it's not as much as I thought it was.

6850
05:08:24,850 --> 05:08:27,390
Maybe if I like go a little bit longer and if I play well.

6851
05:08:27,870 --> 05:08:28,270
Maybe if I like go a little bit longer and if I play well.

6852
05:08:31,210 --> 05:08:33,610
There's not as much as I thought that there was, actually.

6853
05:08:34,090 --> 05:08:35,450
There's not as much as I thought that there was, actually.

6854
05:08:35,450 --> 05:08:36,350
I could still add a bunch to it.

6855
05:08:39,690 --> 05:08:41,130
Crazy Time is crazy!

6856
05:08:41,510 --> 05:08:42,110
I can't wait!

6857
05:08:44,510 --> 05:08:46,250
Depends on how long certain parts take.

6858
05:08:46,810 --> 05:08:49,330
So, 8 hours or so to go?

6859
05:08:49,830 --> 05:08:50,970
Doesn't seem so bad.

6860
05:08:51,850 --> 05:08:53,010
Probably do it...

6861
05:08:53,830 --> 05:08:55,150
Next week, I think.

6862
05:09:00,360 --> 05:09:01,360
Escort Hallway.

6863
05:09:01,580 --> 05:09:02,240
Don't worry.

6864
05:09:07,200 --> 05:09:07,920
Don't worry.

6865
05:09:13,830 --> 05:09:14,570
Don't worry.

6866
05:09:16,270 --> 05:09:18,350
I one-timed it last time.

6867
05:09:21,190 --> 05:09:22,290
I can do this.

6868
05:09:26,220 --> 05:09:27,380
I can do this.

6869
05:09:30,240 --> 05:09:32,160
Thank you guys for hanging out with me tonight!

6870
05:09:33,320 --> 05:09:36,000
I will be gone the next two days.

6871
05:09:36,240 --> 05:09:37,980
I will be streaming again on...

6872
05:09:37,980 --> 05:09:38,580
Sunday?

6873
05:09:39,480 --> 05:09:40,000
Monday?

6874
05:09:40,200 --> 05:09:40,400
I don't know.

6875
05:09:40,420 --> 05:09:41,840
I don't think I will be able to stream either.

6876
05:09:45,060 --> 05:09:46,440
But Tuesday I have stream.

6877
05:09:46,720 --> 05:09:48,440
And Wednesday is my anniversary!

6878
05:09:49,240 --> 05:09:49,600
Yippee!

6879
05:09:50,980 --> 05:09:51,420
So...

6880
05:09:51,420 --> 05:09:53,400
Next weekend is also quite busy.

6881
05:09:53,540 --> 05:09:55,340
Because I am attending another convention.

6882
05:09:56,600 --> 05:09:57,540
But I will...

6883
05:09:58,040 --> 05:09:59,800
fit in some streams when I can.

6884
05:10:00,000 --> 05:10:02,320
This convention has me quite busy, actually.

6885
05:10:02,520 --> 05:10:03,440
It's in Texas!

6886
05:10:03,720 --> 05:10:06,540
If you're in Texas and you want to come hang out with me.

6887
05:10:08,880 --> 05:10:10,320
I'll be doing a panel as well.

6888
05:10:10,420 --> 05:10:11,440
With Ayami-sensei.

6889
05:10:12,400 --> 05:10:12,960
Yeah.

6890
05:10:13,660 --> 05:10:16,500
I think every weekend up until...

6891
05:10:16,500 --> 05:10:18,280
a point is like a...

6892
05:10:18,280 --> 05:10:19,500
different event or convention.

6893
05:10:19,820 --> 05:10:20,900
It's kind of crazy for me.

6894
05:10:21,340 --> 05:10:21,960
But oh!

6895
05:10:22,200 --> 05:10:24,620
If also you're at MJS Con this weekend...

6896
05:10:26,120 --> 05:10:27,580
I will be...

6897
05:10:27,580 --> 05:10:29,840
There will be a little interview with me.

6898
05:10:30,400 --> 05:10:32,680
And you can also ask me some questions.

6899
05:10:33,460 --> 05:10:35,320
It's kind of a short little thing.

6900
05:10:35,520 --> 05:10:37,900
They have me for like a 15 minute slot.

6901
05:10:37,900 --> 05:10:39,280
I'm not like a guest or anything.

6902
05:10:39,440 --> 05:10:41,060
It's just like a short little...

6903
05:10:41,060 --> 05:10:42,660
How did you get into Metal Gear?

6904
05:10:42,860 --> 05:10:44,300
And then if anybody has some questions.

6905
05:10:44,360 --> 05:10:45,080
And things like that.

6906
05:10:45,140 --> 05:10:47,020
But you can see me at MJS Con!

6907
05:10:49,340 --> 05:10:49,700
And...

6908
05:10:51,120 --> 05:10:53,060
Can we drop off any gifts for you there?

6909
05:10:53,400 --> 05:10:55,960
I don't really have a way to accept gifts.

6910
05:10:56,580 --> 05:10:56,940
So...

6911
05:10:58,840 --> 05:10:59,680
I don't know.

6912
05:10:59,740 --> 05:11:01,360
I don't think so.

6913
05:11:01,440 --> 05:11:01,880
I'm sorry.

6914
05:11:04,860 --> 05:11:05,220
Um...

6915
05:11:06,540 --> 05:11:06,900
Yeah.

6916
05:11:09,280 --> 05:11:10,280
Time for P.O.

6917
05:11:10,300 --> 05:11:10,580
Box.

6918
05:11:10,700 --> 05:11:11,100
No, no.

6919
05:11:11,540 --> 05:11:12,020
Okay.

6920
05:11:12,100 --> 05:11:12,960
I'm gonna go to sleep.

6921
05:11:13,480 --> 05:11:15,000
And you guys...

6922
05:11:16,200 --> 05:11:17,160
Have a good night!

6923
05:11:17,280 --> 05:11:18,620
Have a good one!

6924
05:11:19,960 --> 05:11:20,920
Thank you!

6925
05:11:21,100 --> 05:11:21,820
Thank you!

6926
05:11:22,160 --> 05:11:22,300
Thank you!

6927
05:11:22,300 --> 05:11:22,640
Thank you guys!

6928
05:11:24,800 --> 05:11:25,460
Thank you!

6929
05:11:25,600 --> 05:11:26,240
Thank you!

6930
05:11:26,380 --> 05:11:26,680
Thank you!

6931
05:11:26,760 --> 05:11:28,460
For a fun time!

6932
05:11:28,720 --> 05:11:29,240
Bye bye!

6933
05:11:29,580 --> 05:11:30,020
Bye bye!

6934
05:11:30,100 --> 05:11:31,260
Bye bye!
