1
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,080
Ah ah ah ah ah, oh, da da da, da da.

2
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,180
Welcome back, Master.

3
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,800
Hello, hello, hello!

4
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:49,350
Oh my gosh, I saw... I saw someone say one last trip to mid-world.

5
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,110
That's true!

6
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,310
Oh my gosh, you're right!

7
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,590
It's the last time!

8
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,610
I didn't even think about that!

9
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,010
That's crazy!

10
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,110
That's crazy!

11
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,310
Oh my god, how are you feeling, Minto?

12
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:12,950
Actually, I just, like, right before the stream, had like a killer migraine.

13
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,990
So I'm really glad that it's gone.

14
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:17,970
Maybe!

15
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,850
So I might be a little bit low energy because of that.

16
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,890
But, yeah!

17
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,070
Last of 2.0.

18
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,470
Yes.

19
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,610
Oh my gosh!

20
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,070
I'll miss the intro and outro so much.

21
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,270
I actually...

22
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:41,070
I was kind of stressing because...

23
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,770
As of this morning, I was missing 3 major things.

24
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:52,990
No, sorry, 4 major things for my re-debut, which is tomorrow!

25
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,090
Oh my god.

26
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,730
I get migraines once a month.

27
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,190
Oh, I'm sending you good vibes.

28
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,190
Thank you!

29
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,150
That might actually be why I had a migraine.

30
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:06,550
Maybe.

31
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,850
I didn't think about that, actually.

32
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,890
But I was missing 4 major things.

33
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,910
And I got 2 of them today.

34
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,850
One of them was actually my new intro.

35
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,070
And I got it this morning and I was like...

36
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,770
It's so good!

37
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,150
And...

38
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,690
I got another thing that I needed.

39
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,950
And then the 2 last things that I need are basically finished.

40
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,430
So, oh my gosh.

41
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:38,320
Everything...

42
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,480
Actually, I'm waiting... Well, there is one thing, but if I don't have it done, that's okay.

43
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,720
Basically.

44
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,080
It's one of the guests for karaoke.

45
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,280
So, yeah.

46
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,580
Oh my god.

47
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,440
Everything has been so last minute, but that's okay.

48
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,320
I kind of was just like...

49
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,620
So...

50
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,840
Less than 24 hours to go.

51
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,860
Yeah, baby!

52
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,420
Oh my god.

53
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,300
Oh my god.

54
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,080
But did Minto receive a new heart that loves wisps?

55
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,300
I guess you'll have to see.

56
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,240
I wouldn't get your hopes up, though.

57
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,500
So...

58
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,140
Sounds super stressful.

59
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,660
I thought I had faith.

60
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,180
I had faith.

61
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,640
I think.

62
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,940
I think.

63
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,140
But, oh my gosh, now I'm even more excited because everything just looks so good!

64
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,380
Yippee!

65
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,160
No, you played, Faith.

66
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:53,760
Oh, yeah.

67
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,800
Tomorrow, tomorrow.

68
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,580
I love you, tomorrow.

69
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,320
It's only a day away.

70
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,460
And tomorrow is also Chri...

71
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,360
Not Christmas.

72
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:06,900
Oh my god.

73
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,000
It's gonna feel like Christmas.

74
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,840
It's Halloween!

75
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,660
It's basically my Christmas.

76
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,040
Halloween is my Christmas.

77
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,640
It's my Christmas.

78
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,460
Why did I almost say Christmas?

79
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,080
Christmas hype.

80
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,060
No, we still have a Halloween to get through.

81
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,460
Please.

82
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,760
I don't want to think about Christmas until November 1st.

83
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,780
Then what is Christmas?

84
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,500
Double Christmas.

85
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,760
Santa's coming early.

86
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,540
I know, and there's so much happening, I think, tomorrow, too.

87
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,700
I mean, of course there's always gonna be a lot happening.

88
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,000
With streamers on a holiday.

89
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:07,400
Hopefully, despite all the fun activities that you might see going on wherever you're watching.

90
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,440
Twitch or YouTube.

91
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,700
Whatever, wherever.

92
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,280
Whatever, whenever, wherever.

93
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:23,000
You will hopefully find some time to drop by my little debut.

94
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,060
It shouldn't be so long.

95
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,640
Probably like two hours.

96
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,040
If you are like, oh my gosh, I can't watch everything in one day.

97
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,640
It's not gonna be left finger point, right finger point.

98
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,740
It's not gonna be, you know, like all day event or anything.

99
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,540
But, yeah, very excited.

100
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,180
Didn't expect Shakira today.

101
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,900
I stand for Thanksgiving.

102
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:04,960
See, I felt like this game was a nice transition from Halloween into the fall.

103
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:13,200
If you're a US-American, Thanksgiving kind of vibe is going on.

104
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,880
You know, I thought, I was like, hmm.

105
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:22,180
Do I wanna end our Halloween spooky month on a really scary game?

106
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:29,980
Or do I want to do like more of a, kind of a feels-y vibe.

107
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,440
And, you know, this one's a nice feels-y vibe.

108
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,140
So, there is no fall in Texas.

109
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,760
But you got the yeehaw.

110
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,320
I am not a US-American.

111
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,880
You know what, that's okay too.

112
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,580
We can all appreciate fall.

113
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:54,060
And even if we live in a place that doesn't have fall, we can all pretend.

114
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,840
You know, just crank that AC up.

115
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,480
And be like, ah, what a brisk morning.

116
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,600
Oh, wait, not up.

117
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,040
Down.

118
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,520
Crank it down.

119
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,300
And be like, what a fall crisp morning.

120
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,880
And light that pumpkin candle.

121
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,080
Yeah.

122
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,620
Don't have AC.

123
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,870
Turn on your fan.

124
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,580
Yeah.

125
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,260
Or something.

126
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,580
I don't know, get a hand fan.

127
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,260
You want me to hand hold you through all the steps?

128
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,140
How to create a fall?

129
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,640
I don't know, I don't know.

130
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,340
Figure it out Google, wiki how.

131
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,460
Do it.

132
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,180
How to Google.

133
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,120
Yes.

134
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,220
Yes.

135
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,240
But yeah, if you don't know this game, it is another game that I have played before.

136
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,220
I'm sorry that, I guess this month has kind of been a couple games that I've played through before.

137
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,720
Actually, maybe that's been the past couple of months since I've been going through Metal Gear again too.

138
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,860
Throwback October.

139
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,720
DMC1 was new.

140
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,240
Yeah.

141
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,460
Wait, what else have I done that was like not new, let's see.

142
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,620
Things that I've played before.

143
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,220
So sorry if it's not like a fresh reaction.

144
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,700
But it's been a minute since I've played this game, so...

145
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,400
It's kind of like a fresh reaction.

146
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,580
Let's see.

147
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,800
Okay, so I played Faith.

148
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,820
Oh, Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion, that was new.

149
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,120
Over the Garden Wall, that was not new.

150
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,100
Grunt, that was new.

151
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,540
No, Peggle...

152
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,640
It was Peggle Extreme, it wasn't normal Peggle.

153
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,120
The Bath House?

154
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,760
Well, it was a different version of the Bath House.

155
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,560
Eternal Darkness?

156
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,360
Oh wait, I'm into September already.

157
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,780
But that was still new, you know.

158
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,260
Mario Party?

159
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,980
Yeah, it was a new Mario Party.

160
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,600
Yeah.

161
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,400
I experienced, but I experienced an old feeling.

162
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,260
The feeling of getting screwed over.

163
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,260
In Mario Party.

164
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,840
MGS was new?

165
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,740
How was MGS new?

166
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,380
Turtle, it's your birthday!

167
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,720
Of course I can sing happy birthday!

168
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,260
Oh my gosh, I like your profile picture.

169
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,380
What an awesome drawing.

170
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,900
So cool.

171
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,700
Happy birthday to you.

172
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,540
Happy birthday to you.

173
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,640
Happy birthday, dear Turtle.

174
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,680
Happy birthday to you.

175
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,380
Happy birthday!

176
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,840
But yeah, so...

177
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,380
Hopefully you don't mind.

178
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,700
If I replay this...

179
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,880
A little bit.

180
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,240
Sloppy Sisters were new?

181
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,120
True, true, true.

182
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,740
A pretty cool artist drew it for me.

183
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,880
Yeah, I bet they're so awesome.

184
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:12,780
Cool.

185
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,280
Okay.

186
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,420
Oh, I don't know this game, it's new to me?

187
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,160
Awesome!

188
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,180
Then...

189
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,600
No spoilers, everybody.

190
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,520
No spoilers.

191
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,900
I'm going to try for the good end.

192
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,620
But no promises.

193
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,680
I tried looking...

194
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,360
I'm not going to lie.

195
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,280
I tried looking up like a guide of how to get the good end.

196
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,280
And...

197
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,640
Nothing would tell me.

198
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,040
So no spoilers for people in the chat.

199
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:46,600
Okay?

200
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,840
Okay, let's start.

201
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,440
Oh, icky.

202
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,310
Spooky.

203
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,770
Little frog, she's so cute.

204
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,060
Sorry, I'm like adjusting audio.

205
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,340
It's our guy.

206
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,280
You just put those on.

207
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,840
Oh my gosh, I thought the rock was snoring.

208
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,780
I thought the rock was asleep.

209
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,900
Oh, to be a pinecone elf.

210
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,770
Oh my god.

211
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,450
I hope we didn't need that.

212
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,040
He's so chill about it.

213
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,300
He's like, wow, okay.

214
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,080
Forgot about the little fox in this.

215
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,920
How could you forget about Benjamin?

216
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,160
Benjamin.

217
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,010
Be aware.

218
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,190
Oh my god, Stanley Parable.

219
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,130
Narrator.

220
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,450
I love rewards!

221
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,270
What will my reward be?

222
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,610
Oh my gosh, she's so cute.

223
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,750
I forgot my...I forgot my hat!

224
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,530
This is Miss Fortune.

225
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,430
Sorry guys, I forgot my little hat.

226
00:15:49,970 --> 00:16:01,310
A little sparkle for you, and a little sparkle for you, and a little bit for me.

227
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:05,930
What's that?

228
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,390
No!

229
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,450
No!

230
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,030
Spoiler.

231
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,630
Okay, narrator.

232
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,470
She's like, maybe we should bring that part up again.

233
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,570
We're dying to meet you!

234
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,610
Wait, am I going to go back to heaven?

235
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,210
I sure hope not.

236
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,850
Am I going to cross on over?

237
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,530
Maybe we shouldn't have said deal.

238
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,830
Leave the house.

239
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:22,150
Click on left mouse button to walk.

240
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,370
Oh, it's like a click?

241
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:25,830
Okay.

242
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,750
Left mouse button to interact.

243
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,710
Okay, left mouse button for everything.

244
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,710
Let's go inside.

245
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,450
Happy spoopy day, Minto!

246
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,190
Australia!

247
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,930
Happy Halloween!

248
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,710
How's the audio by the way?

249
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,730
How's the audio?

250
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:56,850
How's the audio?

251
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,730
If it's okay.

252
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,230
It's good?

253
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:02,930
Okay.

254
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,450
I feel like this is a really... What's the word?

255
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,070
It's a very audio driven kind of game.

256
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,410
I try to let them speak more than me.

257
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,450
A little bit.

258
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,990
Who's Bubsy?

259
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,670
Who cares about Bubsy?

260
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,070
Leave the book for Bubsy?

261
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,490
What the heck is a Bubsy?

262
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,990
I'm taking it with me.

263
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,350
Kinda cool.

264
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,990
Can you wish my friend Honch?

265
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,390
Honch a happy birthday.

266
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,510
Please don't fall.

267
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,530
I'm just trying to figure out what it is.

268
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,650
That seems sus.

269
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,190
I know.

270
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,630
It does seem sus.

271
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,910
Honch...

272
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,050
Honch...

273
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,350
Trois.

274
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,210
Honch Trois?

275
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,860
Honch Trois?

276
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,160
I don't... What?

277
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,140
Honch.

278
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,520
Oh, is it supposed to be like the Honch Tour?

279
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,340
No, it's Honch.

280
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,720
Trois.

281
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,020
It's French.

282
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,440
I guess I hear the tour.

283
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,840
Trois.

284
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,040
It's like a fancy version.

285
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,040
Honch Trois.

286
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,420
Coloring book.

287
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,260
Nice.

288
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,340
Oh, what is that?

289
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,420
Creepy stories.

290
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,120
She's just like me for real for real.

291
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,280
I used to have so many books like that.

292
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,420
I mean, that's a ghost.

293
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,080
It's just, you know.

294
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,900
But you just said nobody's allowed to read it.

295
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,900
Miss Fortune Damirez Hernandez.

296
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,400
I like to play a lot with my toys.

297
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,220
I like to talk to them because it's fun.

298
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,200
Cute.

299
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,600
Hello diary.

300
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,520
At school I drew and at home I was at my hiding spot talking to Bubsy and I heard it.

301
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,240
I saw a fox walking outside my room.

302
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,600
He's called Benjamin, I think.

303
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,000
Benjamin.

304
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,060
Benjamin.

305
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,620
That fox.

306
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,540
Oh my goodness.

307
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,760
Hello diary.

308
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,280
My dad lied to me again.

309
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,020
Not going out to the park today.

310
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,400
I made myself pretty but he doesn't care.

311
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,560
I feel sad.

312
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,780
I cried but told mommy I'm okay.

313
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,780
I'm afraid if I tell her I'm sad, she'll be angry.

314
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,280
Sometimes I don't know how to feel.

315
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,080
Nobody is teaching me how to feel.

316
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,960
I wish in school they'd teach us where feelings come from.

317
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,100
But for reals.

318
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,340
No fairy tales.

319
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,260
She has like the cleanest handwriting.

320
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,520
Ever.

321
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,260
Yikes forever.

322
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,380
Yikes forever.

323
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:45,860
Oh my god.

324
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,100
Hello diary.

325
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,540
Is it okay to have feelings for a fox?

326
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,520
Misfortune watched Disney's Robin Hood for the first time ever.

327
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,860
Zootopia.

328
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,520
I guess Zootopia would be a more modern way.

329
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,220
Does anybody even watch the...

330
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,180
Do kids even watch Robin Hood anymore?

331
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:13,920
I don't know.

332
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,800
I think Robin Hood is more...

333
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,440
Still more charming than...

334
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,520
What's his name?

335
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,300
The guy from Zootopia.

336
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,080
I think he was always...

337
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,020
The guy from Zootopia is kind of a bit of a whiny dude.

338
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,480
Nick, yeah, yeah, Nick.

339
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,180
Nick Wilde.

340
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,600
Is that his name?

341
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,520
Your age is showing Minto.

342
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,320
What are you talking about?

343
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,940
Robin Hood is a classic.

344
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,740
What do you think?

345
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,560
I was born in...

346
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,500
When did I come out?

347
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,240
In like the 60's or something crazy?

348
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
When did I die?

349
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,800
Oh no, I don't know.

350
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,000
Uh oh.

351
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,760
That Robin Hood really stuck with you, huh Mint?

352
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,640
Oh my gosh, yes.

353
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,220
I'm not the...

354
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,000
I feel entirely valid.

355
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,580
I feel entirely valid in having a crush on the Robin Hood.

356
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,240
Thoughts on the Fantastic Mr. Fox?

357
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,920
I never saw it, it's creepy.

358
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,240
I never watched it.

359
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,690
Like, Robin Hood is just way too...

360
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,090
And then Maid Marian...

361
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,810
It's... Literally Robin Hood is for everybody.

362
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,650
Everybody can have...

363
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,010
A crush...

364
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:47,730
In Robin Hood.

365
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,010
They're both so hot.

366
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,950
Girl, you're so valid.

367
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,930
I knew you'd have my back.

368
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,250
Robin Hood's a criminal?

369
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,090
But he's a good criminal.

370
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,370
He's like...

371
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,050
Batman.

372
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,530
Batman shouldn't be beating people up, that's a crime.

373
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,230
You don't see anybody being like, oh Batman, that guy deserves to go in jail.

374
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,730
Yeah, the anti-hero.

375
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,850
Yeah, but Batman is Batman.

376
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,850
Yeah, and Robin Hood is Robin Hood.

377
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,550
As long as they're charismatic, who cares.

378
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,850
Isn't that how it goes?

379
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,710
As long as you have the charisma.

380
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,170
The Rizma.

381
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,050
If you have the Rizma, then you are...

382
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:45,450
Okay.

383
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,030
That's how all the stories go.

384
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:53,910
The Rizma.

385
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,170
That's what it is.

386
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,490
I also puke too.

387
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,470
All the time, not just in love.

388
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:27,590
I don't feel right.

389
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,980
And Sean Connery never played Batman.

390
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,730
Eggy sushi.

391
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,390
Oh my god.

392
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,830
My Japanese friend speaks Japanese.

393
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,510
That's very problematic when we want to talk.

394
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,410
I thought she was calling him speaking Japanese problematic.

395
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,630
Oh my god, everybody cancel Hiro.

396
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,610
That guy can only speak Japanese, it's problematic.

397
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,570
It's hard to understand each other.

398
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,390
It's confusing.

399
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:18,790
But I like him.

400
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,510
He has a pair of sweet boots and a cowboy hat.

401
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,250
His name is Hiro and he's a ghost.

402
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,350
Just like me.

403
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,690
I drew a picture of him.

404
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:27,950
Oh wait, I drew a picture.

405
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:28,910
Wait, sorry.

406
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,430
I drew him a picture.

407
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,610
Oh my god, my dyslexia.

408
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,250
But I never gave it to him.

409
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:44,930
Oh my gosh, I want to be friends with Miss Fortune so she can say that about me too.

410
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,930
Hello diary.

411
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,190
Look, I have glitter from Sewell.

412
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,610
It's super shiny and we use it to make Christmas cards.

413
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,190
I think Christmas cards are pretty.

414
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,150
But I don't believe Santa is for reals.

415
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:01,550
If a man could give everyone a gift, why can't he give poor people water and food?

416
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,990
Oh my gosh, Miss Fortune is already thinking about such things.

417
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,070
Where is your cowboy hat?

418
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,550
I never got one.

419
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,950
They never gave me one at the ghost academy.

420
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:22,050
I saw a TV show with people from other countries having nothing to eat.

421
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,290
Anyway, I don't believe Santa is real.

422
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,810
There's people starving in the world.

423
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,390
Anyway...

424
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,410
But the glitter is amazing.

425
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,910
It makes me think that all the...

426
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,990
Wait, that...

427
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,810
All that makes me sad and angry can be sprinkled with sparkle to make prettier.

428
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,590
Wait, to look prettier.

429
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,210
What's wrong?

430
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,530
I can't read today either.

431
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,390
That makes me a little less sad.

432
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:46,530
Glitter.

433
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,230
I love my glitter.

434
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,110
Glitter!

435
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,370
Hello diary, I went picking tomatoes with my grandma.

436
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,230
It smelled so nice.

437
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,930
I saw butterflies, some other insects too.

438
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,110
I ate two tomatoes and then I was stuffed.

439
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,710
I made a real nice drawing there.

440
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,350
You see?

441
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,510
Yes, very nice.

442
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,230
I did the coloring too.

443
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,350
Impressive.

444
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,270
Inside the lines...

445
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:12,590
Mostly.

446
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,830
Miss Fortune, we need to talk about down there.

447
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,390
A little bit.

448
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,730
And this part you didn't finish, you didn't fill in.

449
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,710
The shading is...

450
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,190
Where is the light direction coming from?

451
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,430
And this one just has no shading at all.

452
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:29,750
Abysmal.

453
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:34,070
Her art isn't going to get any likes or retweets.

454
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,130
It's true!

455
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,290
It's true.

456
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,930
Two out of ten.

457
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:44,090
Hello diary, I was riding my tricycle.

458
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,790
We don't have money for the bicycle and I looked straight in the sun.

459
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,470
And I started crying because it hurt my eyes.

460
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,610
My mommy said that one should not look directly at it.

461
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,970
At least her mom is teaching her something.

462
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:05,210
Hello diary, it was fun today because I was at the lake and I saw birds flying and also fish in the water.

463
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,490
I felt like warm water came near my bottom.

464
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,870
What does that mean?

465
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,490
I peed in the lake.

466
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,810
It was really warm.

467
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,870
She has the look of someone peeing in the lake, doesn't she?

468
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,290
Just like that thousand yard stare.

469
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,970
I'm sure the fish appreciated it.

470
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,830
It's like some sort of nutrients, right?

471
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,150
Hello diary, how are you?

472
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,090
I'm good too.

473
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:44,750
I have to do homework, but I can't stop thinking about Benjamin.

474
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,930
I found a picture of me when I was younger.

475
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,350
Time goes fast.

476
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,450
The cake looks yummy.

477
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,090
Very cute.

478
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,350
She's a lady.

479
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,370
She's a little lady.

480
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,630
Babycorn, thanks for the gift card!

481
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,050
The ammonia is good for the algae.

482
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,110
Halloween.

483
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,850
Halloween costumes idea.

484
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,490
Little lady fox.

485
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:16,690
This is sick.

486
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,890
Actually, both of these...

487
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,610
Are these stickers or did she draw these?

488
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,110
They look so good.

489
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,930
That's it for the diary.

490
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:26,370
Awesome.

491
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:30,170
This is Bubsy, the guardian of the secret spot.

492
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,710
You see his eye?

493
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,830
He got that from a battle against a monster.

494
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:37,430
Scary.

495
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:44,570
I think we did everything in here then.

496
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:44,850
Cool.

497
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,090
So that's Bubsy.

498
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,490
Sorry Bubsy, I took your thing.

499
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:53,150
Oh, I can walk around with...

500
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:54,730
Benjamin!

501
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:00,370
For tomorrow's show, we waited with baited moods.

502
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,150
But you should know tonight, you're pretty good.

503
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,770
Thanks, Brian!

504
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,470
Benjamin.

505
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:14,930
Okay.

506
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,330
Nobody asked.

507
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:20,390
What?

508
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,670
She runs.

509
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,210
She looks kind of... Why does she got that look on her face?

510
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,570
I like to move my body.

511
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:34,030
It's the music that goes on forever.

512
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,430
I hope this is copyright free.

513
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:45,970
I hope I don't get struck by YouTube.

514
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:52,050
I hope my channel won't be taken down.

515
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,550
She's got some moves.

516
00:31:59,230 --> 00:31:59,590
Forever.

517
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,970
Dance, dance, yeah.

518
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,250
Oh, get it.

519
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,250
Misfortune.

520
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,310
Oh, break it down.

521
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:15,950
Oh yeah.

522
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:20,950
And kick, kick, bounce, bounce, kick, kick, bounce, bounce, kick, kick.

523
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,470
Kick, kick, kick.

524
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:22,870
Okay.

525
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:25,470
Thank you.

526
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,950
Your rock is kind of bloody over there, I think.

527
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,690
Take the glitter!

528
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:44,690
Nice.

529
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,250
Click on misfortune to throw glitter.

530
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,370
Now this is important.

531
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:01,130
You might see me spamming glitter a little bit.

532
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,890
You might see me spamming the glitter a little bit.

533
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,730
For those who have not played the game...

534
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,210
It's important.

535
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:15,050
I saw a monster in here once.

536
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,090
I showed it the finger and it never came back.

537
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,350
You show a misfortune.

538
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,230
She's so metal sometimes.

539
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,790
She's kind of odd.

540
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,370
I love her so much.

541
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,230
She's just...

542
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,990
She's so badass.

543
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:40,750
Oh, we can take a toy?

544
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,330
You can only choose one.

545
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:52,110
And remember, your choice is much more important than you think.

546
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:52,490
Okay.

547
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,410
I choose...

548
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,590
Unicorn or stone?

549
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,870
I don't remember.

550
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,190
Wait.

551
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,510
I think we should...

552
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,190
I don't remember which is important.

553
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,270
Never seen a unicorn?

554
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,210
I don't think I have either.

555
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,410
Stone is a better weapon.

556
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,570
Stone for throwing things.

557
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,970
It is a rock fact.

558
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,830
Tossing glitter to fill our dark souls with light.

559
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,510
I want to bring the stone.

560
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,670
But I don't remember what the difference is to be honest.

561
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,030
Unicorn has the horn though.

562
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:42,090
True.

563
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:47,430
Steven.

564
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,250
Sorry, I want to bring the stone.

565
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,450
Stoney.

566
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,990
The narrator is so nice.

567
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:12,650
Oh my god.

568
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:19,950
Fabulous.

569
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:24,870
Yeah!

570
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,530
The glitter is a chaff.

571
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:29,750
A bit me-me.

572
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:35,810
Benjamin!

573
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,090
Well, we keep it a secret, huh?

574
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:47,150
Wait, is there anything in here I can glitter real quick?

575
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:51,810
I don't think so actually.

576
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:56,610
Why is the sound effect so loud for the glitter?

577
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,130
Let's see.

578
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,670
How old is Miss Fortune?

579
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,470
I still don't quite understand.

580
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,330
Oh no!

581
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:18,630
Don't fall!

582
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:19,090
Don't fall!

583
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,490
I didn't mean...

584
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:33,390
It's ok.

585
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,490
We'll just glitter it.

586
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,330
We'll just glitter it.

587
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,230
Hold on, I was trying to read some of this though.

588
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:45,270
Did mommy find out who did it?

589
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,010
Miss Fortune!

590
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,180
That's kind of the same thing.

591
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,160
Maybe I could try to fix it.

592
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,340
Fix it!

593
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,480
We got this.

594
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,320
We can fix it.

595
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,260
Oh, we're actually fixing it.

596
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,700
Let's see.

597
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:38,920
Wait.

598
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,880
This goes like around here-ish.

599
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,980
But this goes...

600
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,200
Wait, this goes...

601
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,320
This goes there.

602
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,960
And then this goes there.

603
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,360
And this goes...

604
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:53,840
There.

605
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,820
I can't say the darndest things.

606
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,260
Right, Minto?

607
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,280
Wait, this goes there.

608
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,500
We're doing it!

609
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,220
We're doing it!

610
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,560
We're doing it!

611
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,200
We're doing it!

612
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,360
And in the flower.

613
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,040
Perfect!

614
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,260
Oh my gosh, the cars.

615
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,980
Fix the vase.

616
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,880
Wait, if I glitter...

617
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:39,730
Even when I'm sad.

618
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,010
Oh my god.

619
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,750
Uh-huh.

620
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,850
It's the nervous laughter at the end of every sentence.

621
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,590
It's the little...

622
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,230
Oh my god.

623
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:15,030
I forgot just how much this game is a little, you know...

624
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,050
Yeah, there's nothing else.

625
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,390
Oh my goodness.

626
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:23,990
I don't know how to explain it.

627
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,290
Juice.

628
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:32,370
I am.

629
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:38,890
What's in here?

630
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,650
Misfortune.

631
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,550
Misfortune, shut the door!

632
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,910
Yeah, that's good.

633
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,030
Shut the door, Misfortune!

634
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,110
Thank you.

635
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:08,810
Mushrooms!

636
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,550
Yuck.

637
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,090
Yikes forever.

638
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,330
It's a real yikes forever moment, yeah.

639
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,930
Can you just imagine?

640
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,770
You're trying to cook.

641
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,590
You're trying to make something for dinner.

642
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:39,090
And, like, your kid comes up and just throws glitter into it.

643
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:42,790
Into the big pot of boiling soup.

644
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:47,490
And it's just, like, ruining the meal.

645
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,590
Yikes forever.

646
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,050
Wait, what was that?

647
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:53,550
Oh, here.

648
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,970
That didn't clean up though.

649
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,250
Juice!

650
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:11,890
Juice!

651
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:18,110
Okay, we got three sparkles.

652
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:27,190
Oh, it's October 11th.

653
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,490
No, that was like two weeks ago.

654
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:34,850
Tell mommy you're leaving?

655
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:35,930
Yeah, we'll see.

656
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:37,790
We're a good kid.

657
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,570
I'm going out to play, mommy!

658
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,110
So cute.

659
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,530
Good morning, Minto!

660
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,320
Nervous laughter.

661
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,940
She has a nervous laughter just like me.

662
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,760
For real, for real.

663
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,480
Remember Benjamin the fox?

664
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,700
This is where I first saw him.

665
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,840
Good afternoon!

666
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,040
Morning!

667
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:07,540
Wait.

668
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,220
Good morning!

669
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,320
Minto afternoon!

670
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,160
It was really intense.

671
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,160
Yes, you told me about that fox already.

672
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,640
That fox.

673
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,520
You shouldn't trust a fox.

674
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,420
They're all criminals.

675
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,580
What?

676
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,900
A fox criminal?

677
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,960
That's silly.

678
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,580
How can an animal be a criminal?

679
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,200
Stupid narrator.

680
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,580
Does he know anything?

681
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,900
Stomped out!

682
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,720
Oh my god, the cat is so cute.

683
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:55,920
Daddy?

684
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,860
Where is he?

685
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,540
Happiness to the cat!

686
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,120
Oh, the cat has a little symbol.

687
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,920
Rest in pepperoni, the homeboy Peter Rabbit.

688
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,140
Why does misfortune creepily sound like tenma?

689
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,380
I don't know.

690
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,620
I don't know.

691
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,960
I can't pinpoint what the accent is.

692
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,980
Hello kitty.

693
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,440
Here, come.

694
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,400
Come kitty.

695
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,560
Kitty, kitty.

696
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,220
Kitty!

697
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,120
No!

698
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,760
Why are you so mean?

699
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,360
Oh god.

700
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,480
Be careful.

701
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,840
Look both ways before crossing the street.

702
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:43,840
Maybe you shouldn't yell at them.

703
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,000
Okay, should we listen?

704
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:55,940
Should we listen?

705
00:43:59,280 --> 00:43:59,840
Consequences.

706
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,600
Sounds like Until Dawn.

707
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:08,840
Okay, should we listen?

708
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:11,800
Swedish.

709
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,700
It's Swedish.

710
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,060
Okay.

711
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:52,010
Why are there so many spooky games with moose people?

712
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:57,250
I think...can I press space to...no.

713
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:00,010
Okay, so I have to click on her to activate...

714
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,550
Put a little blanket on him.

715
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,610
He's a little tired.

716
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:18,190
Animated intro.

717
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,490
A little misfortune.

718
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:31,230
Not enough horror games with moth people?

719
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,250
Why do you want more moth people?

720
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,160
It's raining on her.

721
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,500
Look at her.

722
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,800
She sees the...

723
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,280
She sees the good in everything even though she's just an unlucky little kid.

724
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,460
Oh god!

725
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:01,270
And everybody in there died.

726
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:02,910
Oh my god!

727
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,850
That was a close one.

728
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:10,930
Oh, it did also...I think the glitter sets things on fire maybe.

729
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,590
Oh my gosh.

730
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:21,560
She's actually, like, related to...

731
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,200
Like a Shinigami or something.

732
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,540
Yeah, why'd you go out this far?

733
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,360
Misfortune.

734
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,360
Now focus, Misfortune.

735
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,520
You have to make a very difficult choice regarding this puppy now.

736
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,480
Be aware of the consequences.

737
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,400
I don't...this scares me.

738
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,440
Oh gosh.

739
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,260
He's all ready for the party.

740
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,840
What if he's trying to get to the party?

741
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,440
We might have to set him free to get to the party.

742
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,280
Play with the pupper?

743
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,340
Yeah,

744
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:25,990
but...

745
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:26,710
Freedom.

746
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:29,790
He longs for freedom.

747
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:34,290
Beware the bus?

748
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,790
Oh yeah, you're right, true.

749
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:37,210
He can run away and then get...

750
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:38,670
Play in the road?

751
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:39,590
Ok, we'll play with him.

752
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:45,010
I will play with it so we can share a nice time together.

753
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:47,030
What?

754
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,970
What do you mean throw the ball at it?

755
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,110
No, you throw the ball away.

756
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,350
So that he can go and run and catch it.

757
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:58,070
It's not throw the ball at the puppy.

758
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:19,960
Oh my God.

759
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,960
Oh my God, he literally became a pancake.

760
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,660
I think that puppy wasn't real.

761
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,480
Look at the way it's smooshed.

762
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,160
I think it was like a plushie.

763
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,940
You guys, it was like a squish animal.

764
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,140
It's ok, we're fine.

765
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,180
What accident?

766
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,740
I'm not coping.

767
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,100
I'm just...

768
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:58,180
No.

769
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,020
Wait, what's this?

770
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,600
Oh, you can still pet the dog?

771
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,760
Do you think that's in one of those... that database of you can pet the animal?

772
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,120
Can I take the ball?

773
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,680
Yeah, puppy killer.

774
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,920
Red ball puppy killer.

775
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,420
Everybody, all my homies hate red balls.

776
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:35,370
Nice.

777
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:39,710
What does this say?

778
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,830
It says no dogs allowed.

779
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:43,930
Oh, really?

780
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:48,890
Well then, I think the tree was just following protocol.

781
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:51,710
The tree is actually...

782
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:56,050
It's a tree person.

783
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,810
You can see there, they have a little cutout for the face.

784
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,170
They're holding branches.

785
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:06,950
It actually... he's a snitch, the tree.

786
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:10,410
Balance was achieved.

787
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:11,590
Oh my goodness.

788
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:19,750
Oh god!

789
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:21,010
Miss Fortune!

790
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,010
What is wrong with you?

791
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:29,810
Let's just keep going.

792
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:31,250
Let's work here.

793
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:36,790
Okay.

794
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:37,290
Okay.

795
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:38,430
Oh wait, your vomit too?

796
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:39,370
We can even observe that?

797
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,090
Oh, okay.

798
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,770
The narrator is speaking for all of us?

799
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:57,890
Why is she eating the glitter?

800
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:00,170
I told you she put it in the soup, you guys.

801
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,730
Oh, where are we?

802
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:05,170
Recycling.

803
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:05,970
Oh, what's this?

804
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:08,070
That sign doesn't work.

805
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:10,610
Do you see all the crap lying around?

806
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:11,910
So true!

807
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:15,590
Thank you.

808
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:18,230
Oh my gosh.

809
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:26,030
Wow.

810
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:29,310
Oh yeah, we're going to party!

811
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:32,370
We're going to the party.

812
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:34,870
There is so much trash.

813
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:52,310
Glitter to the...

814
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:55,630
What the?

815
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:06,730
She looks like this happens all the time.

816
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:10,370
She looks so fed up with them.

817
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:12,630
She's like I can't...

818
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:13,850
Okay.

819
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:19,330
Oh, kick them in the balls or throw glitter at the birds.

820
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:22,650
I don't think birds have balls.

821
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:33,930
Yeah!

822
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:36,010
Oh true, actually.

823
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:44,030
Oh, it worked.

824
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:57,090
Oh.

825
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,390
She's just chilling.

826
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:07,390
Oh!

827
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:08,550
Oh my gosh.

828
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:10,190
It's the bird!

829
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,610
This game is so dumb.

830
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:22,830
And save.

831
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,310
Such a rude bird.

832
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:31,030
True.

833
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:34,810
Yeah, we had the best parachute ever.

834
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:43,030
Is this the same lake she swam in?

835
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:45,190
This is why I don't swim in lakes.

836
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:47,930
George?

837
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,070
Oh.

838
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:54,730
Will you tell George about the puppy accident?

839
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:57,850
I think George deserves to know.

840
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,650
But then also George left his dog there.

841
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:06,830
Honesty is the best policy.

842
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:08,050
I think so too.

843
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:10,450
Miss Fortune is a good girl.

844
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:22,430
Aww.

845
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:37,160
I can't believe this lake has just a never ending bridge on it.

846
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:37,620
Oh!

847
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,060
Oh, he can take the fish with us.

848
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,340
Free fish, yeah!

849
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,080
I'm gonna take it.

850
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,140
I'll keep it.

851
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,340
Do lakes usually have a bridge like this across it though?

852
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,000
Oh, he's...

853
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,420
It's a little slimy.

854
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,060
He'll probably be fine.

855
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,060
Oh yeah.

856
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:18,700
Oh yeah.

857
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,540
I'm sure this will make a fine slab of sushi.

858
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:27,240
This fresh, fresh fish from this trash lake.

859
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:31,380
George!

860
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:36,360
Hi Mint, hello!

861
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,200
Hello!

862
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,440
I didn't read the subtitles, so I thought she said stupid.

863
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,040
I thought she was like stupid, I'm doing it for the puppy.

864
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:54,840
Oh no!

865
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,920
Ok, this fish needs a friend.

866
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,340
Ping pong!

867
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:06,350
Rodrigo?

868
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:07,950
You mean Codrigo?

869
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:11,090
Time to check out the party!

870
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:12,150
The party!

871
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:14,390
We're gonna party!

872
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:16,550
Tomorrow we'll party.

873
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:27,450
I saw a man who was floating in the lake, just like this fisher.

874
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:30,330
He was sunbathing.

875
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:36,710
Surely, he was just practicing his float.

876
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:43,110
What a nice picture.

877
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:47,010
I wish I had a picture like this with my mommy and daddy.

878
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:52,210
Hello?

879
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:55,710
What is it, Miss Fortune?

880
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:56,610
Nothing.

881
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:58,250
He spooked me!

882
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:03,410
Why are sometimes ghosts so weird about what they can do?

883
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:05,210
Gosh!

884
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,470
Do I scare you guys?

885
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:09,110
Wait, but that's the kid in the picture.

886
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:10,250
I guess he's dead.

887
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:16,030
Are you sure this is the right house?

888
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:17,310
Where is the party?

889
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:19,030
Yes, all the time!

890
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,810
You guys are too nice.

891
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,230
Is there anything we can sparkle in here?

892
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:31,770
I wanna make sure I don't miss anything, you know?

893
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:38,170
Excuse me, are you George?

894
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:40,310
Oh, Miss Fortune.

895
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:42,250
Are you the owner of a puppy?

896
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:44,570
Because I bring really bad news.

897
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:46,330
I'm just hanging out, man.

898
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,870
There's no party today.

899
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:51,050
Like a piñata?

900
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:53,370
Should I hit him like a piñata?

901
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:54,370
Oh, Miss Fortune!

902
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:56,290
He's dead.

903
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:57,190
Dead?

904
00:57:57,770 --> 00:57:59,990
But he's wearing a pair of sweet boots.

905
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:01,910
He can't be dead.

906
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:07,130
You know if you got sweet boots on, you can't be dead, you guys.

907
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:07,990
Okay.

908
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:12,590
Hey, Miss Fortune, I think this party's over.

909
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:13,830
Let's leave.

910
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:14,870
I'll meet you in the back.

911
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:16,910
The guy didn't even finish his croissant.

912
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:19,970
Now that you're dead, your puppy is gone.

913
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,250
I like the puppy.

914
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:22,030
Bye.

915
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:27,390
After Sunday, you will forever instill fear in me if you sing the Monster Mash again.

916
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:29,990
Why wait until Sunday?

917
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:31,690
Oh.

918
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:41,810
Don't call him a piñata.

919
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,050
No, Miss Fortune!

920
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:45,670
Don't call him that.

921
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:56,530
I guess he's so sad about his son.

922
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:57,390
He's so sad.

923
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,320
Check the painting?

924
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,220
Oh wait.

925
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,000
Oh no, I didn't check the painting!

926
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:15,230
I'm so sorry, I didn't see it.

927
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:19,710
Do you think I can go back?

928
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:20,790
Or did it save?

929
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,490
Wait, does that mean I don't get the good end?

930
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:25,950
Oh no!

931
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:27,670
Oh, it doesn't affect the ending?

932
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:28,050
Okay.

933
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:30,290
You guys scared me.

934
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:37,170
You don't need it?

935
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:37,790
Okay, okay, okay.

936
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:40,090
It's just extra.

937
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,830
I think you guys can look it up if you want to know.

938
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:45,350
Really?

939
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:47,790
I hate the woods.

940
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,250
Oh my god.

941
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:57,930
Oh my god, she's kicking her feet.

942
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:00,090
But all foxes are evil.

943
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,110
So keep your eyes open.

944
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:06,590
Why are we trusting you, narrator?

945
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,730
How many foxes have you met?

946
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:10,770
You assume all of them are evil.

947
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:15,130
Just look at this nice little stroll.

948
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,990
And there's like a...

949
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:24,750
Hey doll, find the doll number one.

950
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:29,450
Everything begins with the song of a jack...jack doll.

951
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:39,550
She's so like, okay, about everything.

952
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:43,770
Is this Blair Witch?

953
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:46,790
Nothing?

954
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:51,490
Yeah, misfortune, yeah.

955
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:56,370
Me and misfortune are of the same...oh!

956
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:05,610
It's Benjamin!

957
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:09,050
What do you mean attack it?

958
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:13,050
He doesn't even notice I'm here.

959
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:14,050
Hi Benjamin!

960
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,210
He's like...

961
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:22,170
No!

962
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:26,670
He hates us!

963
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:29,330
He hates us!

964
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:32,530
He hates us!

965
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:38,350
He hates us.

966
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:42,330
Cave sounds exciting.

967
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,570
Can I finish this?

968
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:03,990
Sprinkle glitter to the...to the...

969
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:05,810
cult circle.

970
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:08,990
She didn't finish it.

971
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:10,130
Oh, we finished it for him.

972
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:14,290
Were we supposed to finish that?

973
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:20,030
It's the moose!

974
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,160
He keeps the sea bears out.

975
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:37,640
Hey, get out of my way.

976
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:38,900
Out of my way.

977
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,340
Be careful of your head, misfortune.

978
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,600
Be careful of your head.

979
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:52,600
Sparkle!

980
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:54,400
Sparkle!

981
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,540
To the...to the...to the dancing outline.

982
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,640
Warning signs are for losers.

983
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,180
These rules are meant to be broken, huh?

984
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,560
Nah, lame, lame cave.

985
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,680
I didn't believe in ghosts until I found my Yoshi.

986
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,220
What does this sign mean?

987
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,560
Oh, sparkles!

988
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:24,660
I'll sparkle it.

989
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:25,640
Oh, stay in the forest.

990
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:27,820
Hold on.

991
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,100
I want to sparkle it.

992
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,320
I want to sparkle it first.

993
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,100
Oh, it didn't do anything.

994
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:41,240
I thought it would work.

995
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,440
I'd be stuck with so much choice paralysis.

996
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:52,220
Misfortune is...she's a girl who knows what she wants.

997
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,820
She's a little girly who...

998
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,900
Actually, she just kind of blindly follows anything he says.

999
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,620
Alright, time to enter the cave, I guess.

1000
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,160
Magic!

1001
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:11,580
Magic!

1002
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,260
A little lady...oh, yeah, sorry, my bad.

1003
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,600
She's a little lady.

1004
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:20,540
Echo!

1005
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:24,840
Okay.

1006
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,680
You can at least humor us, narrator.

1007
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,180
Come on.

1008
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:49,460
Oh my god, we almost got run over by a rat!

1009
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,060
What the hell?

1010
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,920
We need to have stop lights in this dang cave.

1011
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:15,020
What are you...Mr.

1012
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:15,580
Narrator!

1013
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:17,980
Mr. Narrator!

1014
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,400
Oh my god.

1015
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:28,960
What do you want me to do?

1016
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,960
End the violence between the hamsters?

1017
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:37,720
No, let's just see what happens.

1018
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,160
Let's just see what happens.

1019
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,140
It's not our drama.

1020
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:51,960
Fight!

1021
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:52,820
Fight!

1022
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:53,600
Fight!

1023
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:56,160
Oh damn, he took him out!

1024
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,660
Now he's dragging him inside.

1025
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:02,940
They went inside to party.

1026
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:09,140
It looks like someone spilled their ketchup.

1027
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,220
Someone had a big burger in there.

1028
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,120
Kanna!

1029
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:17,560
Thanks for the raid!

1030
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:23,240
My name is Mint Phantom.

1031
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,020
Today we are playing Little Misfortune.

1032
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:27,440
It's a bit of a weird game.

1033
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,140
Is there money in here?

1034
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,560
Let's take the money and the gun.

1035
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,260
Take the gun, Misfortune!

1036
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:49,200
Oh Misfortune.

1037
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:49,760
Oh no!

1038
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:50,320
Misfortune!

1039
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:56,780
I don't think she was supposed to take the mints.

1040
01:06:59,500 --> 01:06:59,920
Ducky!

1041
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,220
Thanks for the 5 gift card!

1042
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:03,320
Notorious Banshee, thanks for the gift card!

1043
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:06,780
Oh, there's a puppy and her friends.

1044
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:12,780
Yes!

1045
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,980
Oh, the puppy is like, yeah, let's go!

1046
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,940
Oh my gosh.

1047
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:27,470
Oh no, not the crows!

1048
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:29,070
Croaky!

1049
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:31,530
This is me too whenever I say croaky.

1050
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:38,810
You guys, mints.

1051
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:40,070
Not even once.

1052
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:52,110
What do we do with the purse?

1053
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:54,450
I guess we just take it.

1054
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:57,870
Hey Mr. Hamster, can I get in?

1055
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:03,790
Little lady.

1056
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:13,010
How would we even get in?

1057
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:16,670
I don't think even crawling we would be able to make it through there.

1058
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:19,270
Sir Streak, thanks for the 5 gift card!

1059
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:21,090
What does this mean?

1060
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:22,250
Also, I'm not that important.

1061
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:23,030
What?

1062
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:24,290
This guy is that important?

1063
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:25,990
Huh?

1064
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:26,630
This guy?

1065
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:28,510
This guy right here is that important?

1066
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:30,230
Okay.

1067
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:32,290
Okay.

1068
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:33,490
Sure.

1069
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:34,810
But I'm not that...

1070
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:38,230
I don't... It's also... It's... It's like...

1071
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:39,750
Not even like a club club.

1072
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:47,270
It's like... How is this an exclusive club?

1073
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,650
Hijack the cars?

1074
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:50,910
Yeah, let's take the cars.

1075
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:53,510
Try princess!

1076
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:54,530
Thanks for the gift card!

1077
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:02,050
So cute!

1078
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:03,650
Oh my goodness.

1079
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:05,970
What are these guys doing?

1080
01:09:11,650 --> 01:09:14,470
Nah, they're just adorable little hamsters.

1081
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:18,370
These guys, they're gonna have little more hamster...

1082
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:21,070
Oh my gosh, when I was a kid, we had hamsters.

1083
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:24,210
And...

1084
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:26,670
And...

1085
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:29,170
They kept multiplying.

1086
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:32,770
They escaped from the cages once, and then we couldn't find them.

1087
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:35,930
And then they kept having babies in the walls.

1088
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:39,930
And...

1089
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:43,610
Then, I don't know what happened.

1090
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:46,570
I think it got buried in the back.

1091
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:48,370
Somehow they died.

1092
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:50,090
I don't know.

1093
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:54,710
I was a kid, so...

1094
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:56,970
I probably wasn't told the whole truth.

1095
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:04,630
I just remember where at least one of them was buried in the backyard.

1096
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:07,750
They were in your walls.

1097
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:08,930
I don't know where they were.

1098
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:10,190
They were just lost.

1099
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:14,230
And like sometimes under the beds and stuff, we would find little hamster poops.

1100
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:20,830
Trying to find all the hamsters.

1101
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:24,550
AGSMG, welcome to membership.

1102
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:25,110
Thank you!

1103
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:29,510
I mean, would you want them to let a little lady inside that kind of club?

1104
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:30,530
Yeah, we are a lady.

1105
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:32,050
We are too ladylike.

1106
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:32,970
We are too...

1107
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:34,930
We go to classier clubs than this.

1108
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:35,230
You know what?

1109
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:35,890
Let's get out of here.

1110
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:39,050
What's this?

1111
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:47,110
How do you recognize...

1112
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:49,450
How do you know that narrator?

1113
01:10:56,770 --> 01:11:01,530
He is going on a robbing spree.

1114
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:03,410
He is mugging everyone.

1115
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:05,170
Let's help our grandma.

1116
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:06,670
Oh, my bad.

1117
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:08,110
Hold on.

1118
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:15,870
But watch out for the mints.

1119
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:19,430
Hamster crime spree.

1120
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:26,850
Oh my god!

1121
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:28,310
VIP!

1122
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:34,950
Wow, very important hamster.

1123
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:48,170
I'm same.

1124
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:53,710
How is that the only way out?

1125
01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:57,250
What is this though?

1126
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:02,430
This area is so mysterious.

1127
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:06,250
What are these?

1128
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:10,530
What are these?

1129
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:11,790
Some sort of export?

1130
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:19,710
Excuse me, I'm very important now.

1131
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:22,250
Excuse me, I'm a very VIP.

1132
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:23,810
Here is my ticket.

1133
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:27,190
Let me in!

1134
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:29,170
Oh my god.

1135
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:31,290
We are in the real party!

1136
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:40,030
How did they get so big?

1137
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:51,070
In a hamster club?

1138
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:53,670
Ok.

1139
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:56,770
I'm not gonna get caught...

1140
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:57,490
Not copyright.

1141
01:12:57,610 --> 01:12:59,150
I'm not gonna get struck though, right?

1142
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:02,230
It's fine.

1143
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:03,330
Probably.

1144
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:06,770
I'm not playing honey pop or anything.

1145
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:07,750
Look at her dance.

1146
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:08,710
Excuse me.

1147
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:14,330
Yummy.

1148
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:16,030
Ribbon maybe?

1149
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:18,330
Anybody else?

1150
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:19,150
Glitter for you!

1151
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:24,290
Glitter for you!

1152
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:33,510
I have to get...I can't get past him.

1153
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:41,590
Oh my god!

1154
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:53,970
I don't...what does that mean?

1155
01:13:57,550 --> 01:13:58,070
Huh?

1156
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,570
Very important poltergeist.

1157
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:02,310
Oh my gosh, we gotta actually play.

1158
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:05,350
Alright, let's go.

1159
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:07,810
The face is so funny.

1160
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:34,070
It's SSR!

1161
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,350
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1162
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,880
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1163
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:49,740
Oh, no!

1164
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,680
My finger slipped.

1165
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:55,260
It's...

1166
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,620
Wait, why is it SSR?

1167
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,280
Oh, stone revolution.

1168
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,120
That's what I was thinking.

1169
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,260
Shake that booty!

1170
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,540
Do, do, do.

1171
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,680
Do, do, do.

1172
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,540
Do, do, do.

1173
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,020
Do, do, do.

1174
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,200
Do, do, do.

1175
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:25,860
Oh my god.

1176
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,220
Oh she loves me!

1177
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,760
How much longer is this?

1178
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:36,220
What is this?

1179
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:43,940
She

1180
01:15:55,870 --> 01:15:56,770
loves us!

1181
01:15:56,810 --> 01:15:59,090
Oh my gosh, Stoney is so good.

1182
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:03,530
Score high in the club.

1183
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:06,030
I think I scored high.

1184
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:11,310
I know, I almost had a full combo.

1185
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:12,530
My finger slipped.

1186
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:20,150
Did that work?

1187
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:21,390
OK.

1188
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:23,610
Maybe he doesn't need anymore glitter.

1189
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:27,790
This club owns...

1190
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:31,130
Wait, is this the guy from the IT crowd or whatever?

1191
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:33,490
Wait.

1192
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,640
Is that the White Rama?

1193
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,660
Oh wait, anything else in here?

1194
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,560
Glitter for the club!

1195
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,080
Glitter for the club!

1196
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,320
OK, let's leave.

1197
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:59,620
It looks exactly like him, right?

1198
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:04,060
A missing child.

1199
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:06,480
Me?

1200
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:17,820
I missed one!

1201
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:20,320
Where?

1202
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:20,880
When?

1203
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:29,620
I missed one.

1204
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,300
Oh my god.

1205
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,600
How did she do that?

1206
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:39,400
Thank you.

1207
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:44,080
Oh it's an interaction.

1208
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:44,520
OK.

1209
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:46,600
Don't scare me.

1210
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:49,760
We gotta get all the glitters, you guys.

1211
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:53,940
But if I'm missing interactions, I'm scared I'll miss the glitters too.

1212
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:56,400
I can't miss anything.

1213
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:01,500
Call 112.

1214
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:06,260
Maybe, yeah.

1215
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:07,060
Oh, OK!

1216
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:10,860
You can!

1217
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:17,220
Is she the mask that lady was wearing?

1218
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,120
Alright, maybe we can glitter the missing poster.

1219
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:26,340
Sparkle 50 times!

1220
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:30,140
Is that her?

1221
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:57,490
It reminds me of that game where everybody wears masks or whatever.

1222
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:02,630
Or like when you take the medicine to be happy.

1223
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:08,070
A unicycle.

1224
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:10,150
Phantasmagoria.

1225
01:19:11,470 --> 01:19:14,150
Be happy if you...yeah, yeah, yeah.

1226
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,610
That's so awesome!

1227
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:31,750
Oh my gosh, we have to go.

1228
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:33,450
We have to go to the spooky fair.

1229
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:35,130
The horror fair.

1230
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:37,590
Benjamin!

1231
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:47,410
She's so forward.

1232
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:55,030
Yeah, narrator, stay in your lane.

1233
01:19:58,650 --> 01:20:00,030
She can't have been to that anyway.

1234
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:04,050
You, Child-Ren?

1235
01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:12,330
Hide your Child-Ren.

1236
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:14,670
You, Child-Ren?

1237
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:17,390
Hide.

1238
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:19,330
Hide your...

1239
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:21,790
Benjamin.

1240
01:20:25,630 --> 01:20:26,330
Oh my god!

1241
01:20:26,690 --> 01:20:28,910
This is the thing we've been seeing.

1242
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:36,210
We have Hannibal Lecter just casually walking by.

1243
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:43,870
Eh, okay.

1244
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:50,850
He's trying his best on Judge Benji's rising.

1245
01:20:50,990 --> 01:20:51,410
I'm not.

1246
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:52,550
He's a little fox.

1247
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:53,790
He's doing his best, you know?

1248
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:55,990
Let's see what else we got in here.

1249
01:20:57,710 --> 01:20:58,470
A train?

1250
01:20:58,550 --> 01:20:58,930
What's this?

1251
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:06,110
Not in here?

1252
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:06,390
Okay.

1253
01:21:06,910 --> 01:21:07,850
We're not taking the train.

1254
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:11,350
We're running, running, running by.

1255
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:13,590
Oh my god!

1256
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:14,870
Miss Fortune!

1257
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:16,850
Yeah!

1258
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:24,770
Creepy people walking by.

1259
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:26,690
Why does everybody have these masks on?

1260
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:42,370
Being able to read the Swedish throws me off.

1261
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:57,590
It's because she's not eating enough.

1262
01:21:58,850 --> 01:21:59,570
Yeah!

1263
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:00,710
Let's try the sparkle.

1264
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:11,230
Let's go find the prize and make mommy proud.

1265
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:13,310
Okay.

1266
01:22:18,530 --> 01:22:19,810
We're at the park, baby.

1267
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:24,590
What's around here?

1268
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:27,850
Happiness to the sign!

1269
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:30,390
What's this say?

1270
01:22:32,170 --> 01:22:32,970
Okay.

1271
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:36,170
Happiness to the trash!

1272
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:39,610
What's the bench say?

1273
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:42,310
Probably a lot of bad words.

1274
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:53,850
Yeah,

1275
01:22:59,330 --> 01:22:59,910
let's read them.

1276
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,150
That's deep, you know?

1277
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:09,410
Where are they hanging from?

1278
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:15,530
Well, I don't see the cat.

1279
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:18,650
Balls hanging too low.

1280
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:19,750
I see Fran Bow.

1281
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:21,670
Eat fruits and veggies.

1282
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:25,230
Balls hanging too low.

1283
01:23:26,690 --> 01:23:27,850
Kind of is like...

1284
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:33,670
You know, it's like life.

1285
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:39,490
They're hanging too low and it's just hard to pick them up.

1286
01:23:40,190 --> 01:23:40,990
And move.

1287
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:42,450
I think.

1288
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:43,810
It's really deep, yeah.

1289
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:45,330
Fran Bow is their other game, right?

1290
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:55,190
Why does the bird look like someone's dad?

1291
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:05,310
My fish friend forever!

1292
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:09,830
This is my FFF.

1293
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:21,430
No, don't feel like you have to give up your fish misfortune.

1294
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:24,590
Does this seagull even deserve the fish?

1295
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:26,910
I don't think he deserves Rodrigo.

1296
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:30,790
We've had Rodrigo this whole time.

1297
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:33,750
Rodrigo is ours.

1298
01:24:34,050 --> 01:24:35,910
I'm gonna keep my friend.

1299
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:37,330
He's my FFF.

1300
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:41,330
Exactly.

1301
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:51,030
Yeah, well you were the one trying to convince me to get rid of him, narrator.

1302
01:24:53,870 --> 01:24:58,390
Hopefully that didn't result in a missed sparkle opportunity.

1303
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:02,950
Yes!

1304
01:25:03,650 --> 01:25:05,410
Yes, the royal horse!

1305
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:08,610
Royal horse you say?

1306
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,690
I'm a little princess, you know.

1307
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,350
A little princess, a little lady.

1308
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:15,610
Look at me.

1309
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:16,750
I'm on the horse.

1310
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:18,930
Ay, horse is stupid.

1311
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:25,910
That's fortunate I think you need to hold on when you ride the horse.

1312
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:27,310
That was unfortunate.

1313
01:25:27,310 --> 01:25:28,750
Are you alright?

1314
01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:30,870
I'm okay.

1315
01:25:31,230 --> 01:25:33,610
I'm worried because I'm such a little lady.

1316
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:38,150
You are really tiny and you could break.

1317
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:40,010
I broke my arm once.

1318
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:42,150
So you know what I mean.

1319
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:46,450
I've never broken any ectoplasm before.

1320
01:25:52,050 --> 01:25:53,150
Which is weird.

1321
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:55,430
You wouldn't think it could break, you know.

1322
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:56,410
Check out that bag.

1323
01:25:57,170 --> 01:25:59,110
Just go, Miss Fortune.

1324
01:25:59,510 --> 01:26:01,890
You don't want to get involved with ducks.

1325
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:02,770
You don't like ducks?

1326
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:03,750
You don't like foxes?

1327
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:04,490
What's wrong with you?

1328
01:26:05,170 --> 01:26:06,930
And look, he's carrying a boombox.

1329
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:10,670
This could be my opportunity to finally dance for real.

1330
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:13,990
Would you like to show me some of your dance moves?

1331
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:15,450
What's that?

1332
01:26:16,210 --> 01:26:19,290
Wait, show off my dance moves?

1333
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:21,870
I kind of want to see the duck dance though.

1334
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:26,770
I kind of want to see the duck dance.

1335
01:26:29,370 --> 01:26:30,550
One chill duck.

1336
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:31,590
Let's watch him duck.

1337
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:32,550
I mean, not duck.

1338
01:26:32,670 --> 01:26:33,450
Let's see him dance.

1339
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:36,010
I haven't practiced for a while.

1340
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:36,990
No, you've got good moves.

1341
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:39,790
Let's watch him go though.

1342
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:45,950
Don't kick me.

1343
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:46,790
You're getting really close.

1344
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:47,090
Ow!

1345
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:54,150
This guy sucks.

1346
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:55,290
Wait, he's really close again.

1347
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:56,450
Miss Fortune, back up!

1348
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:00,110
Miss Fortune...

1349
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:05,710
She's still dancing though.

1350
01:27:08,110 --> 01:27:08,710
Normal?

1351
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:14,030
Sparkle to the duck.

1352
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:15,470
Sparkle to the duck.

1353
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:17,190
This guy sucks.

1354
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:19,830
I thought he was chill, but he's not chill like that at all.

1355
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:23,630
Here's another thing we can ride.

1356
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:24,970
Do you think she'll hold on though?

1357
01:27:30,090 --> 01:27:32,230
I don't think she's going to hold on you guys.

1358
01:27:39,650 --> 01:27:40,010
No!

1359
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:40,550
Miss Fortune!

1360
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:45,870
No!

1361
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:53,150
She can't stop eating glitter and dirt.

1362
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:57,050
Mysterious plushie number two!

1363
01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:17,910
I like how she giggled after naked.

1364
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:23,950
I have a caramel apple!

1365
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:26,490
I forgot to eat it.

1366
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:28,530
I'm going to eat it after this stream.

1367
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:30,030
Oh.

1368
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:48,230
Oh my gosh, Mr. Narrator.

1369
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:53,660
He put it upside down.

1370
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:55,710
Really?

1371
01:28:59,290 --> 01:29:01,110
Glitter to the signs!

1372
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:21,190
I don't like the thought of that.

1373
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:23,430
The pet cemetery.

1374
01:29:24,070 --> 01:29:26,770
But we didn't get to go to Phasmagoria.

1375
01:29:29,450 --> 01:29:30,370
Yes.

1376
01:29:32,470 --> 01:29:33,390
Sure.

1377
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:35,850
I'm pretty good at answering questions.

1378
01:29:35,990 --> 01:29:36,270
What's that?

1379
01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:50,720
Be honest, child.

1380
01:29:50,980 --> 01:29:52,060
Be honest.

1381
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,360
Hell yeah!

1382
01:30:03,710 --> 01:30:05,150
I have a toy.

1383
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:10,690
I think I once stole a toy from a friend when I was a kid too.

1384
01:30:12,250 --> 01:30:13,590
Yeah, I've stolen stuff.

1385
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:14,910
Whatever.

1386
01:30:15,670 --> 01:30:18,790
I stole my friend's Swiss army knife once.

1387
01:30:19,130 --> 01:30:23,410
I felt so bad, I buried it in the yard and never told him.

1388
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:24,810
Oh my gosh!

1389
01:30:25,530 --> 01:30:27,810
Some treasure hunter is going to go find that.

1390
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:30,610
With this little metal detector.

1391
01:30:31,410 --> 01:30:32,870
Am I happy right now?

1392
01:30:35,050 --> 01:30:38,010
I would be happier if it was tomorrow in my debut!

1393
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:42,690
I stole someone's heart but I returned it.

1394
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:43,110
Wow.

1395
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:45,670
Why did you return it though?

1396
01:30:46,330 --> 01:30:47,790
I would never tell a lie.

1397
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:51,390
What if I said no?

1398
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:54,230
Let's just say no.

1399
01:31:05,170 --> 01:31:08,110
The last question.

1400
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:10,810
Do I feel loved?

1401
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:14,150
Chat, do you feel loved?

1402
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:19,050
Do you feel loved?

1403
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:21,450
No.

1404
01:31:23,430 --> 01:31:25,770
How about when I start the stream late?

1405
01:31:27,710 --> 01:31:28,710
You hate us.

1406
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:30,350
She hates us!

1407
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:32,930
I don't know.

1408
01:31:33,010 --> 01:31:34,270
I don't think she feels loved.

1409
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:37,350
Red eyes, black dragon, welcome to Bamboo Chef.

1410
01:31:37,470 --> 01:31:37,910
Thank you!

1411
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:42,370
She hates us!

1412
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:55,660
Wow.

1413
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:01,920
Thank you for your honesty.

1414
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,100
What are you going to do with those answers?

1415
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,120
More missing children.

1416
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:10,100
It's the same girl and then another kid.

1417
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:14,440
How do you read this?

1418
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:16,060
Oh my god!

1419
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:22,900
Ok,

1420
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:28,260
you promise?

1421
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:30,620
You promise dear reader?

1422
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:35,640
Sparkles!

1423
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,800
Glitter to the missing children!

1424
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:44,060
Eternal happiness.

1425
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:49,660
I have to dig in a grave?

1426
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:50,400
That's weird.

1427
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,240
Yikes forever.

1428
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:57,620
Goldfish.

1429
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:01,820
Yikes forever.

1430
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:05,300
What shovel?

1431
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:07,840
Don't drop it on my head!

1432
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,560
Ok, summoning it from hell?

1433
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:13,260
Demon shovel.

1434
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:19,840
With the way this game is, I literally thought I was going to drop from the sky.

1435
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:21,620
Also, some people said...

1436
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,400
The hat.

1437
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:25,720
Do you think it's Hiro?

1438
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:27,320
Hiro the ghost?

1439
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:35,080
Glitter to the watering can.

1440
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:36,660
Is it this one?

1441
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:47,840
I don't think so.

1442
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:49,620
Free shovel.

1443
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:50,520
Thanks Satan!

1444
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:57,580
This grave feels very haunted mansion, right?

1445
01:33:58,020 --> 01:33:59,040
What about this one?

1446
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,860
Ok, let's see.

1447
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:01,840
Little Lulu.

1448
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:05,480
The first pug to ever strangle a man.

1449
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:10,380
The first, but not the last.

1450
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:11,840
No, I don't think it's this one.

1451
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:13,240
Running table!

1452
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:15,320
I don't think this is the fish.

1453
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:16,260
Welcome to membership.

1454
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:16,900
Thank you!

1455
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,180
I don't think a pug is a fish.

1456
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:27,320
Do you think the pug would be the first to strangle himself?

1457
01:34:28,050 --> 01:34:30,600
He's got no way to breathe.

1458
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:31,480
Poor pugs.

1459
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:39,220
Stephanie Quinn, writer of the erotic novel, Confessions of a Cat.

1460
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,200
Erotic novel?

1461
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:42,920
Talk about crazy!

1462
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:47,840
I'm gonna search that later.

1463
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:52,060
Nah, this is obviously a cat.

1464
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:55,400
Obviously a cat.

1465
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:59,820
Sparkle to the erotic novelist.

1466
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:02,480
Sparkle to the murder pug.

1467
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:04,460
What's this one?

1468
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:05,660
This one has a candle lit.

1469
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:10,700
It says, Poe died doing what he loved.

1470
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:12,100
Eating poo.

1471
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:13,840
Yikes, forever.

1472
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,000
Hi Poco!

1473
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:15,760
Welcome to membership!

1474
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,180
How does she know what an erotic novel is?

1475
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:21,660
Miss Fortune knows a lot of things, you know.

1476
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:24,540
Sometimes fish do eat their own poo.

1477
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:26,840
Nah, I don't think so.

1478
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:29,340
But I have a sneaking suspicion.

1479
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:31,860
Glitter for the poo eater.

1480
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:34,840
This one, ok.

1481
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:36,940
I have two more.

1482
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:39,740
These ones are small, so... What's this one?

1483
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:41,200
Let's see.

1484
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:42,860
Roger the magpie.

1485
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,240
Never saw that window coming.

1486
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:47,220
I don't get it.

1487
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,140
Oh, no, no, no.

1488
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:50,700
No.

1489
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:53,800
Nah, I don't think so.

1490
01:35:53,980 --> 01:35:54,780
I'll keep looking.

1491
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:57,020
Do you think I can actually dig these up?

1492
01:35:58,060 --> 01:35:59,900
And sparkle them, I wonder.

1493
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,140
I wonder if I should try.

1494
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,080
Hold on, I am going to try.

1495
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:05,800
Let's see.

1496
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:07,440
Roger the magpie.

1497
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:09,780
Never saw that window coming.

1498
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:11,780
I don't get it.

1499
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:13,220
Let's dig all of them up.

1500
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,520
Time to become a professional grave digger.

1501
01:36:17,420 --> 01:36:19,280
Ah, no prize in here.

1502
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:22,300
Maybe not.

1503
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:28,120
I thought we would at least get some bones or something, you know.

1504
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:33,220
It says...

1505
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:37,180
Yeah, hold on.

1506
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:37,880
Yikes forever.

1507
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:38,220
Ok.

1508
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,280
Dig it up.

1509
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,920
Ah, no prize in here.

1510
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:45,900
Just a bunch of little bones.

1511
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:46,960
Ok.

1512
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:49,240
That's just a bunch of little bones.

1513
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:56,780
Maybe it's not worth digging all of them up.

1514
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:57,980
Ok.

1515
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,340
Must be the last one.

1516
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:02,660
Whose sad little grave is this one?

1517
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:04,200
I don't even get a headstone.

1518
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:10,460
One more at the far end.

1519
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:11,960
Ok, let's try it.

1520
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:14,260
Oh, I thought you meant the one...

1521
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:15,540
Too little information.

1522
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:17,660
Too little information.

1523
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,880
I thought you meant go and try the one over all the way here.

1524
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:24,040
You know what?

1525
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:24,900
Let's try it.

1526
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:25,600
Oh, wait.

1527
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:30,320
Oh, yes.

1528
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:31,260
There we go.

1529
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:35,320
Dig it up!

1530
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:47,720
We've got this narrator.

1531
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:48,980
Stop backseating.

1532
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:50,460
God!

1533
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:53,640
Ok, now I'm gonna dig up all of them because he annoyed me.

1534
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,800
I'm gonna dig up all of them because he annoyed me.

1535
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:00,860
Yeah!

1536
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:01,320
Go!

1537
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:05,300
Nothing.

1538
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:09,520
Alright.

1539
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:09,700
Alright.

1540
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:13,880
What if the erotic novel is in here?

1541
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:15,740
What if we get the book?

1542
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:24,440
And what a prize it would have been.

1543
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:30,820
I just caused a mess of this cemetery, but you know.

1544
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:34,440
Dig this grave?

1545
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:34,740
Yes.

1546
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:36,260
Am I reading anything new?

1547
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:36,820
No.

1548
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:38,260
Not right now.

1549
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,220
Giving my brain a rest.

1550
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,940
Oh, I got an achievement.

1551
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:45,880
Dig all the graves.

1552
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:51,360
I was called Tomb Lady.

1553
01:38:52,780 --> 01:38:55,520
I actually got an achievement for digging up all the graves.

1554
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,040
Eternal happiness!

1555
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:07,680
Eternal happiness.

1556
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:09,980
Signed, Benjamin.

1557
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:11,120
Benjamin?

1558
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:13,540
No, he wouldn't.

1559
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,340
He didn't.

1560
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:17,600
My eternal happiness.

1561
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:18,200
No!

1562
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:23,420
No, he didn't.

1563
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:24,220
What a disappointment.

1564
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:27,460
I really wanted to surprise mommy with this.

1565
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:28,980
What should I do now?

1566
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:34,200
I think we were so close guys.

1567
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:38,520
Yes, let's do that.

1568
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:40,880
Such a letdown.

1569
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:43,300
Such a letdown.

1570
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:46,580
Look, there he is.

1571
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:47,440
I meant to sparkle!

1572
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,800
Did you steal my eternal happiness?

1573
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:51,020
Not cool.

1574
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,740
He is just here at the scene of the crime.

1575
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:56,840
Hello Benjamin.

1576
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:58,700
Give me back my happiness.

1577
01:39:59,100 --> 01:39:59,880
Run after him.

1578
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:03,120
We can't let the fox get away again.

1579
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:03,480
Okay.

1580
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:05,380
He stole your prize.

1581
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:07,840
Benjamin really disappointed me.

1582
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:09,200
Oh my gosh, that's the worst.

1583
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:10,880
She's not angry.

1584
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:11,980
She's disappointed.

1585
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:15,700
Rainbow eternal happiness!

1586
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:18,540
And he left a prize.

1587
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:20,940
Find the doll 3.

1588
01:40:23,380 --> 01:40:31,140
When unloved children in darkness search for what they have lost, for why they're in pain.

1589
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,260
Children in pain?

1590
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:38,960
Did you find something, Miss Fortune?

1591
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,280
No, you're imagining things.

1592
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,180
Yeah, shut up narrator, you stupid.

1593
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:46,760
Let's go after Benjamin.

1594
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,300
I think someone set Benjamin up.

1595
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:49,980
Maybe.

1596
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,660
He seems like a good guy.

1597
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,660
In case we see the fox, they know how to hide.

1598
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:57,260
Alright.

1599
01:40:58,280 --> 01:40:58,880
Spooky.

1600
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:01,080
What's this?

1601
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:02,880
What the...

1602
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,640
It's a door to... It's a door?

1603
01:41:09,490 --> 01:41:11,190
Shake out this stone.

1604
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:14,590
It's different from regular stones, I'm telling you.

1605
01:41:14,770 --> 01:41:15,990
I think you're right.

1606
01:41:16,770 --> 01:41:17,590
What's this?

1607
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:23,470
The game of death is what feeds the shadows of the beyond.

1608
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,990
What does this mean?

1609
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:28,630
That looks like nonsense to me, Miss Fortune.

1610
01:41:28,630 --> 01:41:29,750
Huh, really?

1611
01:41:30,470 --> 01:41:32,850
Maybe there's some more nonsense around.

1612
01:41:33,410 --> 01:41:39,930
The game of death is what feeds the shadows...

1613
01:41:39,930 --> 01:41:41,750
Are we not playing...

1614
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:42,690
Huh, really?

1615
01:41:43,050 --> 01:41:44,790
Are we not playing a game right now?

1616
01:41:45,530 --> 01:41:47,270
Oh, this piece is loose.

1617
01:41:47,630 --> 01:41:48,810
I'll take it for me.

1618
01:41:49,050 --> 01:41:50,890
Maybe it works somewhere else.

1619
01:41:51,510 --> 01:41:52,290
Let's take it.

1620
01:41:53,290 --> 01:41:53,710
Nice.

1621
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:55,430
Oh, maybe not nice.

1622
01:42:01,870 --> 01:42:05,710
Glitter to the eyeless statue.

1623
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:18,250
Okay.

1624
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:24,210
I don't know.

1625
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:26,050
I don't know.

1626
01:42:26,270 --> 01:42:27,650
Maybe we should sparkle it.

1627
01:42:27,650 --> 01:42:29,190
Now it's safe.

1628
01:42:33,930 --> 01:42:34,770
He's jealous.

1629
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:44,310
No.

1630
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:47,770
She's always thinking of her mom.

1631
01:42:48,570 --> 01:42:49,230
Oh my gosh,

1632
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:57,280
this doesn't look safe at all.

1633
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:02,100
There's a lot of fire around a bunch of dry straw.

1634
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:05,680
Mr. Voice?

1635
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:07,940
Mr. Voice?

1636
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:10,080
What's this?

1637
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:16,580
We actually found a needle.

1638
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:21,520
Wait, you can probably find it again.

1639
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:26,780
Glitter to the needle in the haystack.

1640
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,400
Fox repellent.

1641
01:43:30,660 --> 01:43:31,920
Best 10 out of 10.

1642
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:35,280
Fox repellent?

1643
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:37,840
I can't deny the bottle's sweet style.

1644
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:38,960
I'll take it.

1645
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:39,660
Oh, okay.

1646
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:41,200
I guess we want that.

1647
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:46,420
Oh, we had to take it.

1648
01:43:47,940 --> 01:43:48,920
There's nothing else.

1649
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:50,700
Oh, we couldn't even...oh, what's this?

1650
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:54,640
It looks like there's somebody else behind us.

1651
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:55,460
Hello?

1652
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:55,900
Hello?

1653
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:58,600
Creepy.

1654
01:44:18,290 --> 01:44:18,930
Benjamin!

1655
01:44:19,410 --> 01:44:21,350
Oh, he just went...going to the bathroom.

1656
01:44:23,570 --> 01:44:24,750
It's a litter box.

1657
01:44:26,910 --> 01:44:28,570
Benjamin's like, um...

1658
01:44:28,570 --> 01:44:30,410
Use the fox repellent?

1659
01:44:32,170 --> 01:44:34,690
No, we need to ask him for the journal of happiness.

1660
01:44:42,690 --> 01:44:43,830
Benjamin's so rude!

1661
01:44:43,950 --> 01:44:45,270
I should have used the repellent on him.

1662
01:44:46,330 --> 01:44:46,830
Benjamin!

1663
01:44:47,190 --> 01:44:47,730
I won't...

1664
01:44:48,630 --> 01:44:50,670
I won't be nice to you next time.

1665
01:44:59,730 --> 01:45:00,230
Narrator?

1666
01:45:11,730 --> 01:45:12,790
Where am I?

1667
01:45:13,190 --> 01:45:14,110
What happened?

1668
01:45:14,410 --> 01:45:16,650
A dangerous fox attacked you.

1669
01:45:16,650 --> 01:45:17,810
He actually did though.

1670
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:20,930
He actually kind of did attack you.

1671
01:45:20,950 --> 01:45:21,190
See?

1672
01:45:21,450 --> 01:45:22,070
I told you.

1673
01:45:22,450 --> 01:45:24,290
That fox is evil.

1674
01:45:24,550 --> 01:45:24,890
Yeah.

1675
01:45:25,290 --> 01:45:27,130
Maybe I should listen to you.

1676
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:31,210
We still need to find the fox and take back the eternal happiness.

1677
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:33,910
Maybe we could find out where he lives.

1678
01:45:34,190 --> 01:45:34,530
Yes.

1679
01:45:34,990 --> 01:45:37,810
Give me a minute to figure this out and I'll get back to you.

1680
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:38,450
Okay.

1681
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:39,810
I'll just hang around.

1682
01:45:39,810 --> 01:45:41,430
Nah, we're just chilling.

1683
01:45:42,450 --> 01:45:45,610
Whenever I play games like this where it's like...

1684
01:45:45,610 --> 01:45:47,970
Everyone in the world is...

1685
01:45:47,970 --> 01:45:51,930
Is bad and the world is bad and everyone's just a total asshole.

1686
01:45:52,130 --> 01:45:55,570
I'm just like... About the game devs, I'm always like...

1687
01:45:55,570 --> 01:45:56,550
Who hurt you?

1688
01:45:58,370 --> 01:45:59,730
Who hurt you?

1689
01:46:02,950 --> 01:46:04,410
Let's just, uh...

1690
01:46:04,410 --> 01:46:06,370
Let's put glitter on my throw up.

1691
01:46:07,190 --> 01:46:09,650
For anybody who sees my throw up on the ground.

1692
01:46:10,970 --> 01:46:11,710
Oh, a newspaper.

1693
01:46:14,950 --> 01:46:16,310
Open field...

1694
01:46:16,310 --> 01:46:18,110
Let it...

1695
01:46:18,110 --> 01:46:19,430
Open field is on fire!

1696
01:46:19,650 --> 01:46:20,010
Oh no.

1697
01:46:20,690 --> 01:46:23,690
Local artist GM retires after incident.

1698
01:46:24,250 --> 01:46:25,410
My son is missing.

1699
01:46:27,350 --> 01:46:28,530
Bird invasion.

1700
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:32,110
We didn't win, but we had fun.

1701
01:46:32,710 --> 01:46:34,270
Let's see what's new.

1702
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:40,410
Glitter for the newspaper.

1703
01:46:41,110 --> 01:46:42,170
What's this?

1704
01:46:44,370 --> 01:46:45,970
Oh my gosh!

1705
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:48,550
It's that weird ass bird!

1706
01:46:55,690 --> 01:47:01,690
I'm just gonna go ask another fox.

1707
01:47:01,690 --> 01:47:02,510
To the zoo.

1708
01:47:02,630 --> 01:47:04,330
It's like really far away.

1709
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:05,770
A few birds.

1710
01:47:08,530 --> 01:47:10,550
Oh, but I have no money.

1711
01:47:11,290 --> 01:47:12,410
For a bus ticket.

1712
01:47:14,090 --> 01:47:15,530
There's glitter to the trash.

1713
01:47:15,610 --> 01:47:16,290
Oh my gosh, Ikea.

1714
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:18,670
Glitter to Ikea trash.

1715
01:47:19,510 --> 01:47:20,790
Is there any...

1716
01:47:20,790 --> 01:47:21,590
Nothing to view.

1717
01:47:21,770 --> 01:47:21,910
Okay.

1718
01:47:23,950 --> 01:47:26,810
Open fields centrum gallerian.

1719
01:47:32,550 --> 01:47:34,990
You're just a voice in my head.

1720
01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:36,610
Just a voice?

1721
01:47:39,450 --> 01:47:40,330
Prove it.

1722
01:47:40,610 --> 01:47:43,270
Do you have any plans to make voice packs?

1723
01:47:43,530 --> 01:47:45,510
Whatever you say, Mr. Voice.

1724
01:47:45,590 --> 01:47:45,790
Maybe.

1725
01:47:46,790 --> 01:47:48,410
Yes, I do.

1726
01:47:52,330 --> 01:47:54,710
One moment, we're fixing our stuff.

1727
01:47:55,910 --> 01:47:57,750
I would like to make voice packs though, yeah.

1728
01:48:01,670 --> 01:48:02,150
There.

1729
01:48:04,310 --> 01:48:05,150
Did you see?

1730
01:48:05,450 --> 01:48:08,990
I'm not just a voice in your head, Miss Fortune.

1731
01:48:09,430 --> 01:48:09,910
A what?

1732
01:48:10,230 --> 01:48:11,230
Did you see?

1733
01:48:11,590 --> 01:48:13,770
I'm sorry, I had a shoelace problem.

1734
01:48:15,630 --> 01:48:16,870
Let's just keep going.

1735
01:48:16,870 --> 01:48:19,230
She literally told you that she was tying her shoe.

1736
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:20,310
You can't get mad at her.

1737
01:48:20,890 --> 01:48:21,410
You dummy.

1738
01:48:21,810 --> 01:48:24,010
She literally said, oh, hold on, let me tie my shoe.

1739
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:25,150
Hey, you look familiar.

1740
01:48:26,330 --> 01:48:26,810
What?

1741
01:48:26,810 --> 01:48:27,050
What?

1742
01:48:31,490 --> 01:48:32,950
All missing children.

1743
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:36,630
Miss Sims.

1744
01:48:37,070 --> 01:48:40,890
Wait a minute, is that Daniela Bambini?

1745
01:48:41,370 --> 01:48:41,570
Bambini?

1746
01:48:41,570 --> 01:48:42,550
You know this child?

1747
01:48:42,870 --> 01:48:43,910
Yes, from school.

1748
01:48:44,270 --> 01:48:48,010
She told our teacher to shove the homework at his butt.

1749
01:48:48,330 --> 01:48:49,990
She's very Italian, you know.

1750
01:48:50,550 --> 01:48:52,310
She probably ran away from home.

1751
01:48:52,710 --> 01:48:53,990
She will turn up soon.

1752
01:48:54,250 --> 01:48:55,290
You think so?

1753
01:48:55,470 --> 01:48:55,890
Yes.

1754
01:48:56,610 --> 01:48:56,970
Okay.

1755
01:48:58,130 --> 01:48:59,850
It looks like she's got a third eye.

1756
01:49:01,970 --> 01:49:02,690
Bambini.

1757
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:07,290
She's kind of awesome.

1758
01:49:11,430 --> 01:49:13,430
Sparkles for the old man.

1759
01:49:13,890 --> 01:49:14,490
Oh, what's this?

1760
01:49:15,610 --> 01:49:19,910
Those people in the picture look so happy drinking their juice.

1761
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:22,770
Yummy juice.

1762
01:49:23,510 --> 01:49:24,450
You can't go in there.

1763
01:49:24,450 --> 01:49:25,790
She brings me here all the time.

1764
01:49:26,010 --> 01:49:27,010
It's really boring.

1765
01:49:27,630 --> 01:49:33,230
Sometimes she sends me to buy cigarettes while she hacks strangers by the dumpster.

1766
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:34,510
Is that so?

1767
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:45,290
She's just hugging them.

1768
01:49:46,690 --> 01:49:49,510
Sometimes it's probably like a...

1769
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:49,950
Oh my god!

1770
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:52,170
Take it!

1771
01:49:53,010 --> 01:49:53,630
Take it!

1772
01:49:54,450 --> 01:49:55,230
Steal it!

1773
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:56,790
Steal the wallet!

1774
01:50:01,290 --> 01:50:01,810
Yeah!

1775
01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:03,790
Take the wallet.

1776
01:50:04,970 --> 01:50:06,650
We're taking it.

1777
01:50:07,110 --> 01:50:07,690
Steal.

1778
01:50:07,690 --> 01:50:09,610
There's just a picture inside.

1779
01:50:14,510 --> 01:50:16,330
It must be his kid.

1780
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:17,350
What do you think?

1781
01:50:17,630 --> 01:50:17,870
Sure.

1782
01:50:18,110 --> 01:50:18,630
Why not?

1783
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:20,190
I knew it.

1784
01:50:20,270 --> 01:50:22,110
I'm such a clever little lady.

1785
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:25,970
She's making such intelligent deductions.

1786
01:50:26,150 --> 01:50:28,690
Okay, that guy scared me when he turned around so fast.

1787
01:50:30,310 --> 01:50:31,190
What's in here?

1788
01:50:33,370 --> 01:50:36,450
One time mommy took me here and forgot me.

1789
01:50:36,450 --> 01:50:40,890
I got to play inside all night until a security man found me.

1790
01:50:41,150 --> 01:50:42,590
He thought I was a raccoon.

1791
01:50:45,690 --> 01:50:47,550
That's like every kid's dream though.

1792
01:50:47,590 --> 01:50:50,610
Except for me crying a lot, but it was fun.

1793
01:50:51,230 --> 01:50:53,030
It's kind of every kid's dream though, right?

1794
01:50:53,130 --> 01:50:56,450
To like stay in like a mall or a...

1795
01:50:59,070 --> 01:50:59,670
Raccoon!

1796
01:51:00,570 --> 01:51:04,590
And like just kind of explore places like that.

1797
01:51:05,650 --> 01:51:06,490
Happy face.

1798
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:08,650
Oh, this is where people get those weird-ass masks.

1799
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:18,570
I want to do it once.

1800
01:51:18,690 --> 01:51:19,350
I know, right?

1801
01:51:19,690 --> 01:51:22,530
I feel like they should create like a...

1802
01:51:22,530 --> 01:51:23,770
Like a...

1803
01:51:25,170 --> 01:51:26,010
Like a...

1804
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:27,870
Simulation of what, you know?

1805
01:51:27,990 --> 01:51:29,530
Like a kid's play place.

1806
01:51:29,530 --> 01:51:35,770
Like this is what it would be like if you got locked in a grocery store at night.

1807
01:51:36,350 --> 01:51:38,970
And you can like hide in the...

1808
01:51:39,530 --> 01:51:40,510
In the clothes.

1809
01:51:40,770 --> 01:51:42,510
Oh my gosh, and then if the...

1810
01:51:42,510 --> 01:51:43,250
If some of the...

1811
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:44,090
What's it called?

1812
01:51:44,670 --> 01:51:45,530
The people...

1813
01:51:47,190 --> 01:51:52,950
The people who like work there dressed up as security and walked around with like flashlights and you had to avoid them.

1814
01:51:53,090 --> 01:51:55,470
Oh my gosh, I'm just creating...

1815
01:51:55,470 --> 01:51:56,950
I'm creating Metal Gear.

1816
01:52:02,090 --> 01:52:03,850
That would be so fun though, actually.

1817
01:52:08,290 --> 01:52:09,070
Who's Casey?

1818
01:52:11,970 --> 01:52:13,010
Oh gosh.

1819
01:52:13,730 --> 01:52:14,670
Where's all these kids?

1820
01:52:14,830 --> 01:52:15,630
Everybody's going missing.

1821
01:52:15,690 --> 01:52:16,630
Everybody's going missing!

1822
01:52:16,890 --> 01:52:17,690
Oh my God.

1823
01:52:18,270 --> 01:52:19,390
Oh my gosh.

1824
01:52:19,970 --> 01:52:20,890
This is a lot of children.

1825
01:52:32,490 --> 01:52:33,750
I don't know, narrate.

1826
01:52:34,570 --> 01:52:35,390
I don't know.

1827
01:52:41,590 --> 01:52:42,030
Mysterious.

1828
01:52:43,510 --> 01:52:45,450
Glitter to the missing children post.

1829
01:52:45,470 --> 01:52:46,990
This is the kid we just saw in the picture.

1830
01:52:48,130 --> 01:52:48,690
There you go.

1831
01:52:53,130 --> 01:52:56,250
This looks like the other lady we saw, but this is...

1832
01:52:56,850 --> 01:52:57,050
Wait.

1833
01:52:57,570 --> 01:52:59,010
In the picture, are both missing?

1834
01:52:59,010 --> 01:53:01,350
I got the little notes and everything.

1835
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:05,430
Mystery for the Scooby gang.

1836
01:53:07,330 --> 01:53:10,110
It's just a little concerning, but yeah, it's no big deal.

1837
01:53:17,810 --> 01:53:18,330
Okay.

1838
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:20,890
Oh, okay.

1839
01:53:21,330 --> 01:53:21,970
I can read.

1840
01:53:22,830 --> 01:53:23,290
What's this?

1841
01:53:23,290 --> 01:53:24,050
Ping pong.

1842
01:53:24,290 --> 01:53:24,790
Help me.

1843
01:53:28,810 --> 01:53:29,210
Oh, okay.

1844
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:33,410
We're already meeting his family.

1845
01:53:34,630 --> 01:53:35,630
Oh yeah, sorry.

1846
01:53:35,730 --> 01:53:36,990
We don't like Benjamin right now.

1847
01:53:37,990 --> 01:53:38,210
Yeah.

1848
01:53:39,450 --> 01:53:40,450
Screw Benjamin.

1849
01:53:40,830 --> 01:53:41,530
Yikes forever.

1850
01:53:42,630 --> 01:53:43,290
What are we doing here?

1851
01:53:48,450 --> 01:53:49,030
Wow.

1852
01:53:51,290 --> 01:53:51,870
Great.

1853
01:53:53,290 --> 01:53:54,370
I think about it.

1854
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:56,530
Maybe you'll meet a bestie kid.

1855
01:53:56,690 --> 01:53:57,730
You sound old.

1856
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:00,670
Okay.

1857
01:54:02,930 --> 01:54:04,030
Are you like 20?

1858
01:54:08,530 --> 01:54:13,950
That's like, I think that's the most childlike response she's given this whole game.

1859
01:54:15,630 --> 01:54:19,210
You know, whenever kids are just like, are you old?

1860
01:54:19,670 --> 01:54:21,770
You're probably like 20 or something.

1861
01:54:22,540 --> 01:54:24,230
It's like always what they say.

1862
01:54:29,150 --> 01:54:33,130
Yeah, rhymes with chicken's road.

1863
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:35,690
Misfortune!

1864
01:54:36,890 --> 01:54:38,990
She's so like, you're no fun.

1865
01:54:53,570 --> 01:54:54,450
Rude, rude.

1866
01:54:54,750 --> 01:54:55,910
Sprinkled with glitter.

1867
01:54:57,230 --> 01:54:59,410
Okay, I think we gotta wait for the bus now.

1868
01:55:00,810 --> 01:55:01,290
Cool.

1869
01:55:01,590 --> 01:55:02,430
Alright, let's go.

1870
01:55:04,390 --> 01:55:05,810
Yeah, we're just gonna chill.

1871
01:55:07,810 --> 01:55:08,590
I wanna take a nap.

1872
01:55:08,590 --> 01:55:10,990
I'll sit.

1873
01:55:11,410 --> 01:55:13,950
I'm a bit tired from all the walking, you know.

1874
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:15,150
I can imagine.

1875
01:55:15,590 --> 01:55:17,350
You have very small feet.

1876
01:55:17,670 --> 01:55:19,510
Yes, I'm a little lady.

1877
01:55:19,850 --> 01:55:20,750
That's what I am.

1878
01:55:20,770 --> 01:55:21,810
She's so cute.

1879
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:24,710
Check those old ladies out.

1880
01:55:24,850 --> 01:55:27,230
They're a little scary, don't you think?

1881
01:55:27,330 --> 01:55:28,550
Yeah, they need new masks.

1882
01:55:28,650 --> 01:55:30,010
I've seen worse.

1883
01:55:30,250 --> 01:55:30,610
Really?

1884
01:55:30,950 --> 01:55:31,390
Yes.

1885
01:55:31,390 --> 01:55:35,570
You know, my mommy also uses the same mask.

1886
01:55:35,930 --> 01:55:39,810
She likes to hide her smile and tears behind it.

1887
01:55:40,050 --> 01:55:41,990
Would you like to have a mask like that?

1888
01:55:42,490 --> 01:55:43,050
Maybe.

1889
01:55:43,710 --> 01:55:44,430
I don't know.

1890
01:55:44,590 --> 01:55:47,650
You follow your own road, Misfortune.

1891
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:50,450
You don't have to follow, you don't have to conform.

1892
01:55:50,570 --> 01:55:52,070
See, the bus driver didn't have a mask on.

1893
01:55:53,610 --> 01:55:54,610
Free of harm.

1894
01:55:56,810 --> 01:55:58,010
Free of regrets.

1895
01:56:02,110 --> 01:56:03,050
It's OK.

1896
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:05,350
Hiro is keeping me company.

1897
01:56:05,470 --> 01:56:06,550
Hiro is here?

1898
01:56:07,090 --> 01:56:08,770
He is my friend from Japan.

1899
01:56:08,910 --> 01:56:11,390
Yeah, were you not paying attention before, narrator?

1900
01:56:12,290 --> 01:56:12,690
Where is Kiri?

1901
01:56:19,650 --> 01:56:21,230
Where is Kiri?

1902
01:56:22,530 --> 01:56:23,170
Where is Kiri?

1903
01:56:23,590 --> 01:56:28,290
I love cows.

1904
01:56:29,730 --> 01:56:31,950
Oh my gosh, cute!

1905
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:53,260
The zoo?

1906
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,580
OK, great.

1907
01:56:58,530 --> 01:57:01,680
I have no commentary for that moment.

1908
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:06,260
In fact, I don't even want to.

1909
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:09,920
Yikes, forever.

1910
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:12,240
That's a good...

1911
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:16,440
What?

1912
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:30,700
And she got some free food.

1913
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:34,880
No titties yet.

1914
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:40,540
Yeah, maybe not that method.

1915
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:42,320
Diversion?

1916
01:57:42,580 --> 01:57:44,820
What does diversion mean?

1917
01:57:48,820 --> 01:57:49,500
OK.

1918
01:57:53,260 --> 01:57:57,200
Alright, we are going to do an ultra cool dance or something.

1919
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:57,780
What's this?

1920
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:02,040
Why?

1921
01:58:09,620 --> 01:58:12,620
Don't give her false hope.

1922
01:58:15,580 --> 01:58:17,160
There is more of them here too.

1923
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:21,980
Oh my gosh, I just almost exited out of the game.

1924
01:58:22,860 --> 01:58:24,420
Alright, diversion time!

1925
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:26,000
Glitter!

1926
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:30,040
Glitter to the missing children.

1927
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:32,440
Let's see what's in the trash.

1928
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:41,980
No, maybe we shouldn't dig through the trash.

1929
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:45,120
Oh my gosh, we have to go to Phantasmagoria.

1930
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:51,700
Phantasmagoria.

1931
01:58:51,900 --> 01:58:52,080
Yeah!

1932
01:58:53,120 --> 01:58:54,980
Oh my gosh, this guy has no memory.

1933
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:56,980
The narrator sucks.

1934
01:58:57,060 --> 01:58:58,000
You said we would go.

1935
01:59:07,480 --> 01:59:10,400
Like a stony?

1936
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:17,900
We tell a lie or break the window.

1937
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:18,720
Vandalism?

1938
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:21,720
Or lying?

1939
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:26,080
But then would we have to lose Stony?

1940
01:59:35,060 --> 01:59:38,220
We got a wild hair.

1941
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:41,460
Break the window!

1942
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:48,840
Oh, I can use the rude stone.

1943
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:52,440
Interesting.

1944
01:59:52,820 --> 01:59:53,520
Bye Stony!

1945
01:59:59,710 --> 02:00:00,330
Grab him!

1946
02:00:00,670 --> 02:00:01,450
Ok, nice, nice.

1947
02:00:01,550 --> 02:00:02,390
Go, go, go!

1948
02:00:02,890 --> 02:00:03,950
It wasn't me, it wasn't me.

1949
02:00:07,350 --> 02:00:09,050
We got him back guys, it's fine.

1950
02:00:09,050 --> 02:00:10,610
Isn't this wonderful?

1951
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:15,350
We'll get to see so many caged animals.

1952
02:00:16,230 --> 02:00:18,450
Why are you putting the emphasis on the cage?

1953
02:00:18,470 --> 02:00:22,150
By the way, you did a great job not getting caught by the vendor.

1954
02:00:22,550 --> 02:00:22,770
Oh, thank you.

1955
02:00:23,630 --> 02:00:25,070
Ah, thank you.

1956
02:00:25,470 --> 02:00:29,570
But now, we should find out where the wolf exhibited.

1957
02:00:29,950 --> 02:00:32,050
I think I should have maybe...

1958
02:00:33,250 --> 02:00:34,090
Sparkled the thing.

1959
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:34,830
Uh oh.

1960
02:00:34,830 --> 02:00:37,270
Remember, he knows where the fox lives.

1961
02:00:38,170 --> 02:00:41,490
Hopefully I didn't need to sparkle the window to prepare it.

1962
02:00:42,270 --> 02:00:44,130
This bird invasion is crazy.

1963
02:00:44,610 --> 02:00:45,670
Oh my god.

1964
02:00:47,970 --> 02:00:50,350
What is happening here?

1965
02:00:53,950 --> 02:00:55,390
It's a bird!

1966
02:00:57,310 --> 02:00:58,530
What did he say?

1967
02:01:02,130 --> 02:01:03,310
What's going on?

1968
02:01:03,310 --> 02:01:04,410
It's fortunate.

1969
02:01:04,530 --> 02:01:05,670
Where did you learn such language?

1970
02:01:06,750 --> 02:01:08,150
It's the pirate parrot.

1971
02:01:08,810 --> 02:01:09,810
Num-Num Parrot.

1972
02:01:11,210 --> 02:01:12,730
Wildly spread around the planet.

1973
02:01:13,370 --> 02:01:15,910
This kind of parrot lives across the entire world.

1974
02:01:16,450 --> 02:01:18,250
They talk much, but they say very little.

1975
02:01:18,570 --> 02:01:20,470
They usually work together with human pirates.

1976
02:01:20,730 --> 02:01:22,430
Oh, natural born thieves!

1977
02:01:22,990 --> 02:01:24,770
Founders of the liberation front.

1978
02:01:25,290 --> 02:01:27,610
It says, the Num-Num Parrot.

1979
02:01:28,250 --> 02:01:31,790
This kind of parrot lives across the entire world.

1980
02:01:31,790 --> 02:01:34,510
They talk much, but they say very little.

1981
02:01:34,830 --> 02:01:38,390
They usually work together with human pirates.

1982
02:01:38,930 --> 02:01:40,570
Natural born thieves.

1983
02:01:41,030 --> 02:01:43,230
Founders of the liberation front.

1984
02:01:43,690 --> 02:01:45,390
Mean birdy Num-Num.

1985
02:01:47,630 --> 02:01:48,650
Glitter bird.

1986
02:01:50,570 --> 02:01:51,910
What about this guy?

1987
02:01:52,790 --> 02:01:53,950
He's very wise.

1988
02:01:54,610 --> 02:01:56,650
This bird seems pretty smart.

1989
02:01:56,950 --> 02:01:58,430
You're great.

1990
02:01:58,430 --> 02:01:59,850
Welcome to the bamboo ship.

1991
02:01:59,970 --> 02:02:00,330
Thank you.

1992
02:02:02,430 --> 02:02:03,750
Ignore this guy.

1993
02:02:05,130 --> 02:02:06,710
Oh my god, it's the bird bird.

1994
02:02:06,830 --> 02:02:08,670
It says, Owl Delicious.

1995
02:02:08,950 --> 02:02:09,590
Owl Delicious.

1996
02:02:09,590 --> 02:02:14,970
Owls normally hang near libraries, bookstores and coffee shops.

1997
02:02:15,250 --> 02:02:24,670
Although they seem incredibly smart, their huge self-centered lifestyle drives them to gather useless information.

1998
02:02:25,030 --> 02:02:26,510
They live off attention.

1999
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:28,470
Bunny bird.

2000
02:02:29,290 --> 02:02:30,250
He's like a hipster bird.

2001
02:02:31,230 --> 02:02:32,010
Owl Delicious.

2002
02:02:32,690 --> 02:02:35,370
Even more delicious now with some sparkles.

2003
02:02:35,470 --> 02:02:37,130
Oh my god, it's him.

2004
02:02:37,710 --> 02:02:38,650
It's the bird.

2005
02:02:39,410 --> 02:02:41,890
It's the mysterious... Oh my god, it's the fuck delicious.

2006
02:02:42,730 --> 02:02:46,470
It says, Pachydilios Dishidio.

2007
02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:56,690
These birds multiply at a very high rate with different partners, leaving behind dysfunctional offspring.

2008
02:02:57,290 --> 02:03:05,070
They don't care about anything as long as they are occupied by mindless entertainment.

2009
02:03:05,170 --> 02:03:06,590
Another Vtuber fans.

2010
02:03:08,770 --> 02:03:10,730
40 to 70 years.

2011
02:03:11,010 --> 02:03:12,110
Holy moly.

2012
02:03:13,630 --> 02:03:15,030
Don't flip me off please.

2013
02:03:15,030 --> 02:03:17,750
Somehow I feel offended by that bird.

2014
02:03:21,030 --> 02:03:23,530
It doesn't know what it's doing.

2015
02:03:25,350 --> 02:03:25,990
Food.

2016
02:03:27,230 --> 02:03:27,690
A snack.

2017
02:03:28,190 --> 02:03:29,370
Steal the bird seed?

2018
02:03:29,530 --> 02:03:29,790
Yeah.

2019
02:03:30,710 --> 02:03:32,170
I'm a crime lord now.

2020
02:03:39,370 --> 02:03:41,330
Can I feed them for real?

2021
02:03:42,410 --> 02:03:43,030
Oh I can!

2022
02:03:47,250 --> 02:03:47,990
Thrill!

2023
02:03:50,310 --> 02:03:51,790
She's so...

2024
02:03:51,790 --> 02:03:53,090
She's so aggressive.

2025
02:03:53,310 --> 02:03:55,710
It's like when a kid has a...

2026
02:03:55,710 --> 02:03:57,870
has a cat, you know?

2027
02:03:58,550 --> 02:04:01,010
And they are just so aggressively petting the animal.

2028
02:04:11,650 --> 02:04:13,590
Oh my gosh.

2029
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:16,030
Maybe it needs more glitter.

2030
02:04:16,690 --> 02:04:18,250
I think this bird has enough food.

2031
02:04:28,450 --> 02:04:31,510
Oh I got a feed the birds achievement.

2032
02:04:32,910 --> 02:04:33,510
Lucky us.

2033
02:04:34,270 --> 02:04:35,070
Lucky us.

2034
02:04:35,110 --> 02:04:36,130
She's a cute menace.

2035
02:04:36,230 --> 02:04:36,930
She really is.

2036
02:04:38,290 --> 02:04:40,290
She's got a lot going on, doesn't she?

2037
02:04:45,170 --> 02:04:46,350
The wolf area.

2038
02:04:48,370 --> 02:04:49,330
Oh no!

2039
02:04:50,970 --> 02:04:51,750
Oh my gosh.

2040
02:04:51,810 --> 02:04:52,770
There is a moose.

2041
02:04:53,570 --> 02:04:54,450
There is a brown bear.

2042
02:04:54,730 --> 02:04:58,670
I don't think the wolf and the polar bear should be together.

2043
02:04:58,850 --> 02:05:02,030
In fact, I don't think the polar bear is in the right temperature at all.

2044
02:05:02,870 --> 02:05:03,310
Oh my gosh.

2045
02:05:03,370 --> 02:05:03,990
The restaurant.

2046
02:05:05,750 --> 02:05:06,510
Hi ghost lady.

2047
02:05:06,730 --> 02:05:07,270
Ice cupboard!

2048
02:05:08,430 --> 02:05:09,010
Where is the lion?

2049
02:05:15,130 --> 02:05:16,270
Pet the wolfy.

2050
02:05:16,530 --> 02:05:18,670
Ok, we are running.

2051
02:05:19,610 --> 02:05:20,350
It's gonna close.

2052
02:05:25,490 --> 02:05:26,450
Feeling annoyed?

2053
02:05:26,490 --> 02:05:26,970
By what?

2054
02:05:28,190 --> 02:05:29,130
Wait, what do you mean hormones?

2055
02:05:34,530 --> 02:05:38,550
Wait, what do you mean by that?

2056
02:05:47,690 --> 02:05:48,810
So true.

2057
02:05:53,730 --> 02:05:55,070
Why are you telling her all of this?

2058
02:06:00,190 --> 02:06:02,130
Yeah, yeah, there you go.

2059
02:06:03,690 --> 02:06:05,390
What do you mean the hormones?

2060
02:06:05,670 --> 02:06:08,430
Because why are the hormones making her annoyed?

2061
02:06:12,590 --> 02:06:13,830
Still don't.

2062
02:06:17,330 --> 02:06:18,510
Yikes forever.

2063
02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:32,510
She doesn't want a bad boy.

2064
02:06:33,970 --> 02:06:35,270
Shut up.

2065
02:06:35,390 --> 02:06:36,330
Let her dream.

2066
02:06:37,330 --> 02:06:39,150
Good Benjamin.

2067
02:06:48,870 --> 02:06:52,070
Where was he anyway?

2068
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:57,690
Yeah.

2069
02:06:58,890 --> 02:06:59,810
You tell him.

2070
02:07:00,450 --> 02:07:01,710
You tell him.

2071
02:07:06,930 --> 02:07:07,350
What?

2072
02:07:11,390 --> 02:07:13,590
I'm just looking.

2073
02:07:14,210 --> 02:07:15,370
I'm just looking.

2074
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:20,090
Let's go.

2075
02:07:23,270 --> 02:07:25,370
Oh my gosh.

2076
02:07:25,670 --> 02:07:27,990
That is not a good exhibit for a polar bear.

2077
02:07:28,550 --> 02:07:29,470
Meet Popsicle.

2078
02:07:31,030 --> 02:07:32,270
Oh my.

2079
02:07:38,630 --> 02:07:39,850
Sneaking mission.

2080
02:07:41,050 --> 02:07:43,750
How did I lie?

2081
02:07:44,790 --> 02:07:46,410
We've been watching chat.

2082
02:07:46,930 --> 02:07:50,550
You're gonna believe this hack of a narrator.

2083
02:07:58,230 --> 02:07:59,630
Let's do this.

2084
02:07:59,710 --> 02:08:00,110
For real.

2085
02:08:00,350 --> 02:08:04,970
And if not just blind...

2086
02:08:06,690 --> 02:08:07,230
What?

2087
02:08:13,530 --> 02:08:15,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2088
02:08:20,770 --> 02:08:21,670
Don't tell mommy.

2089
02:08:23,950 --> 02:08:24,890
Yeah, kill him from behind.

2090
02:08:25,210 --> 02:08:26,330
Oh my gosh, it's a crow.

2091
02:08:34,130 --> 02:08:39,270
I mean you could still... I was gonna say throw the glitter in the face, but you know...

2092
02:08:39,270 --> 02:08:40,170
Wait, I wanna see Popsicle.

2093
02:08:40,170 --> 02:08:44,630
Look, the bear in the picture is sucking a Popsicle.

2094
02:08:45,150 --> 02:08:48,210
It looks like it's strawberry flavored.

2095
02:08:48,690 --> 02:08:50,250
Or it's black flavored.

2096
02:08:51,770 --> 02:08:52,630
Oh, the bird is looking.

2097
02:08:54,130 --> 02:08:55,170
Go Miss Fortune!

2098
02:08:55,350 --> 02:08:55,470
Go!

2099
02:08:56,690 --> 02:09:01,650
Oh my God.

2100
02:09:06,090 --> 02:09:09,990
OK Is that polar bear OK?

2101
02:09:11,650 --> 02:09:15,150
Come on, I'm waiting for him to... OK, there we go.

2102
02:09:17,330 --> 02:09:17,890
And...

2103
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:23,980
Little Miss Fortune, please.

2104
02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:27,300
Miss Fortune!

2105
02:09:30,280 --> 02:09:31,880
Sneak past the janitor.

2106
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:32,880
Ninja lady.

2107
02:09:34,580 --> 02:09:35,440
The wolf.

2108
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:37,080
We're getting pretty close.

2109
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:40,080
I'll have... You know ghosts are very real.

2110
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:41,900
Yeah, you have two right here.

2111
02:09:43,140 --> 02:09:44,420
We're ghosts, we're ghosts.

2112
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:49,740
We can use the stone.

2113
02:09:58,340 --> 02:09:58,860
Oh,

2114
02:10:03,680 --> 02:10:04,020
demonic.

2115
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:14,160
What?

2116
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:24,500
Why does anyone pay attention to things, huh?

2117
02:10:25,480 --> 02:10:26,660
Huh, Mr. Narrator?

2118
02:10:28,180 --> 02:10:28,820
Huh?

2119
02:10:30,020 --> 02:10:30,660
Huh?

2120
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:34,200
Oh, the wolf.

2121
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:39,600
My ninja.

2122
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:41,960
Why you gotta make fun of her, huh?

2123
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:45,640
What?

2124
02:10:45,880 --> 02:10:46,580
Come on.

2125
02:10:46,980 --> 02:10:48,500
Don't be like that.

2126
02:10:48,520 --> 02:10:49,220
It wasn't a competition.

2127
02:10:57,020 --> 02:10:57,660
Ninja.

2128
02:10:57,660 --> 02:10:59,340
Got it.

2129
02:10:59,700 --> 02:11:03,540
Meet the wolf, maybe pet it, and get Benjamin's address.

2130
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:04,860
Like a ninja.

2131
02:11:05,340 --> 02:11:06,060
Like a ninja.

2132
02:11:07,860 --> 02:11:08,640
Wait, hold on.

2133
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:17,540
So then, just one second.

2134
02:11:40,620 --> 02:11:43,380
A big, bad wolf.

2135
02:11:50,700 --> 02:11:51,920
You think it's a wolf?

2136
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:56,020
What about red hats, little girls?

2137
02:11:56,660 --> 02:11:58,240
Red-hatted little girls.

2138
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:01,440
He's already in jail.

2139
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:03,660
He's already in the cage.

2140
02:12:04,580 --> 02:12:06,220
What else do you want from him?

2141
02:12:07,540 --> 02:12:08,820
Why can't I click on that?

2142
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:15,860
Why does he have it?

2143
02:12:18,120 --> 02:12:19,700
That's awfully convenient.

2144
02:12:25,160 --> 02:12:27,860
Why must that be with...

2145
02:12:28,580 --> 02:12:36,800
I don't know.

2146
02:12:36,940 --> 02:12:37,740
She still loves him.

2147
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:38,840
She still believes him.

2148
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:40,300
I don't know anyone called Yanni.

2149
02:12:40,420 --> 02:12:41,180
Who's that?

2150
02:12:43,980 --> 02:12:44,720
Yanni?

2151
02:12:45,460 --> 02:12:46,600
What do you mean Johnny?

2152
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:51,540
Are you sure about that?

2153
02:12:52,680 --> 02:12:53,100
Are you sure about that?

2154
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:56,720
Johnny mentioned...

2155
02:12:56,720 --> 02:12:58,100
He really is Metal Gear.

2156
02:12:58,580 --> 02:13:00,420
Oh my God, Sniper Wolf?

2157
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:01,480
Johnny?

2158
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:03,860
Sneaking past the guards?

2159
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:06,580
Guys...

2160
02:13:06,580 --> 02:13:07,200
It's not me.

2161
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:08,980
It's the rest of the world, OK?

2162
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:31,000
Ninja?

2163
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:31,520
Guys...

2164
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:32,320
Gray Fox?

2165
02:13:34,120 --> 02:13:35,320
You're that ninja!

2166
02:13:35,860 --> 02:13:36,740
You're that ninja!

2167
02:13:39,440 --> 02:13:42,020
Guys, it's all coming together for real.

2168
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:44,960
OK, there's a lot going on in here.

2169
02:13:45,020 --> 02:13:45,800
Let's see what we got.

2170
02:13:46,860 --> 02:13:47,340
What's this?

2171
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:50,480
Fancy!

2172
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:52,960
Fancy!

2173
02:13:54,160 --> 02:13:54,900
It's a doll!

2174
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:55,400
It's a doll!

2175
02:13:55,400 --> 02:13:57,540
Is there a key in here?

2176
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:59,600
Another doll.

2177
02:14:10,040 --> 02:14:11,360
A gift?

2178
02:14:11,540 --> 02:14:13,400
A gift or...

2179
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:15,640
A prize?

2180
02:14:21,230 --> 02:14:22,110
Nothing!

2181
02:14:23,390 --> 02:14:25,370
Gosh, he's so nosy, guys.

2182
02:14:29,590 --> 02:14:30,430
Fancy!

2183
02:14:32,190 --> 02:14:33,970
Oh, we don't know yet.

2184
02:14:34,050 --> 02:14:34,550
We don't know.

2185
02:14:37,410 --> 02:14:46,130
Safety rules for handling the big bad wolf.

2186
02:14:50,930 --> 02:14:55,430
About your life?

2187
02:14:58,210 --> 02:15:02,330
So if I don't have regrets, the wolf will let me pet it?

2188
02:15:02,690 --> 02:15:03,910
Yeah, that's girl math.

2189
02:15:05,470 --> 02:15:08,670
That's some real girl math thinking right there, Miss Lady.

2190
02:15:10,490 --> 02:15:13,450
Eventually all things lead back to that wacky adventure at Shadow Moses.

2191
02:15:14,170 --> 02:15:15,010
Yeah, exactly.

2192
02:15:19,310 --> 02:15:20,430
We found...

2193
02:15:20,430 --> 02:15:23,450
I found a paper with some numbers on it.

2194
02:15:26,010 --> 02:15:28,730
8, 9, 4, 5.

2195
02:15:29,110 --> 02:15:30,310
Oh wait, 6.

2196
02:15:31,090 --> 02:15:32,830
8, 6, 4, 5.

2197
02:15:34,750 --> 02:15:36,650
8, 6, 4, 5.

2198
02:15:36,910 --> 02:15:38,050
What's in the boots?

2199
02:15:43,970 --> 02:15:46,070
And that's just what they'll do.

2200
02:15:46,070 --> 02:15:46,550
Focus.

2201
02:15:48,590 --> 02:15:52,970
Gosh, let her have a little time to sing and dance.

2202
02:15:55,170 --> 02:15:56,130
That's a 9.

2203
02:15:56,410 --> 02:15:57,230
You guys!

2204
02:15:58,110 --> 02:15:58,750
You guys.

2205
02:15:59,030 --> 02:15:59,370
Hold on.

2206
02:15:59,430 --> 02:16:00,270
How do I get to the inventory?

2207
02:16:00,970 --> 02:16:02,390
How do I look at my inventory?

2208
02:16:05,590 --> 02:16:08,130
How do I look...Oh that...It literally...

2209
02:16:08,130 --> 02:16:11,490
You guys, it literally wrote 6...

2210
02:16:11,490 --> 02:16:13,150
What do you mean bit?

2211
02:16:13,290 --> 02:16:14,750
What are you talking about?

2212
02:16:14,750 --> 02:16:15,750
That was definitely a 9.

2213
02:16:15,950 --> 02:16:17,770
It literally said 6.

2214
02:16:17,910 --> 02:16:21,550
It said...It had an arrow pointed to it and said 6.

2215
02:16:23,470 --> 02:16:25,310
What are you talking about?

2216
02:16:28,770 --> 02:16:32,050
How do I see my...How do I see my...

2217
02:16:32,050 --> 02:16:33,250
My inventory?

2218
02:16:34,770 --> 02:16:35,410
I...Tab...

2219
02:16:37,870 --> 02:16:38,510
How...How...Options...

2220
02:16:38,510 --> 02:16:43,630
How do I see?

2221
02:16:45,010 --> 02:16:46,250
Oh my gosh.

2222
02:16:46,450 --> 02:16:46,950
My bad.

2223
02:16:47,170 --> 02:16:48,010
I clicked the main menu.

2224
02:16:48,750 --> 02:16:49,210
Extras.

2225
02:16:51,070 --> 02:16:52,030
Art Gallery.

2226
02:16:52,910 --> 02:16:53,370
Dang it.

2227
02:16:53,450 --> 02:16:53,670
No.

2228
02:16:56,350 --> 02:16:58,010
This is cool though.

2229
02:16:58,730 --> 02:17:00,650
I didn't realize the background would change.

2230
02:17:03,130 --> 02:17:04,730
Hold on, maybe we'll see it again here.

2231
02:17:06,830 --> 02:17:08,290
Oh I gotta get the doll again.

2232
02:17:08,770 --> 02:17:09,470
OK, look, look.

2233
02:17:10,250 --> 02:17:10,590
Paper.

2234
02:17:10,970 --> 02:17:11,130
Look.

2235
02:17:12,810 --> 02:17:13,530
8.

2236
02:17:13,530 --> 02:17:15,330
And then it's a 9.

2237
02:17:15,790 --> 02:17:16,430
Obviously.

2238
02:17:17,030 --> 02:17:18,310
But it has an arrow.

2239
02:17:18,750 --> 02:17:22,430
It says 6 right there with an arrow pointed at it.

2240
02:17:25,010 --> 02:17:26,230
I'm not crazy.

2241
02:17:26,310 --> 02:17:27,230
You guys can't read.

2242
02:17:28,710 --> 02:17:30,410
You guys can't read.

2243
02:17:34,610 --> 02:17:37,090
8, 6, 4, 5.

2244
02:17:43,830 --> 02:17:47,030
Yeah chat, you're the dummies now.

2245
02:17:47,270 --> 02:17:49,350
You're the idiots today.

2246
02:17:50,290 --> 02:17:52,470
You're the idiots today.

2247
02:17:58,930 --> 02:18:01,570
Get told by the VTuber.

2248
02:18:01,730 --> 02:18:03,470
A VTuber corrected you.

2249
02:18:03,810 --> 02:18:06,250
You should feel so embarrassed right now.

2250
02:18:06,250 --> 02:18:15,050
You probably feel so stupid right now.

2251
02:18:16,430 --> 02:18:20,110
You probably are just like, oh my gosh, wow, the VTuber was correct.

2252
02:18:20,490 --> 02:18:25,590
Wait, I tried to backseat the VTuber and I was wrong?

2253
02:18:26,410 --> 02:18:28,170
Sacre bleu, that cannot be.

2254
02:18:28,790 --> 02:18:30,730
There is no way that I was wrong.

2255
02:18:30,810 --> 02:18:32,610
The VTuber is supposed to be clueless.

2256
02:18:32,610 --> 02:18:40,610
The streamer is supposed to always be incorrect and I, the chatter, am always supposed to be the one that has the smarter advantage.

2257
02:18:40,770 --> 02:18:44,730
Because I am the one paying attention when the VTuber is not paying attention to the game.

2258
02:18:45,070 --> 02:18:51,850
But today, the VTuber was able to correctly say something that I had missed?

2259
02:18:52,430 --> 02:18:53,770
This cannot be happening.

2260
02:18:54,230 --> 02:19:05,790
No, the VTuber is supposed to be the idiot and I'm supposed to watch the VTuber and say, Stupid VTuber, I will correct you in the chat and I will say the correct answer when you do not see the thing that I saw immediately.

2261
02:19:05,990 --> 02:19:09,530
When you do not see the thing that you should have seen, but that's okay.

2262
02:19:09,850 --> 02:19:14,870
I saw it because I am the smarter person and I feel good about myself because I'm watching the idiot VTuber.

2263
02:19:18,070 --> 02:19:20,370
But today I got schooled by a VTuber?

2264
02:19:23,570 --> 02:19:24,630
Oh my gosh.

2265
02:19:26,510 --> 02:19:28,390
I can't watch this VTuber anymore.

2266
02:19:29,030 --> 02:19:31,230
This VTuber sucks and they made me feel like an idiot.

2267
02:19:31,710 --> 02:19:33,370
Actually this VTuber is terrible.

2268
02:19:33,990 --> 02:19:36,230
I hope this VTuber loses all their subscribers.

2269
02:19:36,910 --> 02:19:40,350
I hope this VTuber feels terrible about themselves because they made me feel bad.

2270
02:19:40,570 --> 02:19:42,290
I'm now an auntie to this VTuber.

2271
02:19:44,910 --> 02:19:46,410
What's going on with the computer?

2272
02:19:54,630 --> 02:19:55,630
Let's try it.

2273
02:20:07,430 --> 02:20:09,290
Our bad boss.

2274
02:20:10,730 --> 02:20:12,170
Your big head was in the way of the note.

2275
02:20:12,470 --> 02:20:14,270
No it wasn't!

2276
02:20:14,850 --> 02:20:16,350
I know it wasn't.

2277
02:20:16,750 --> 02:20:19,590
So 8, 9...let's see actually if it works.

2278
02:20:21,830 --> 02:20:23,170
8, 6...oh wait.

2279
02:20:23,970 --> 02:20:26,170
8, 6, 4, 5...

2280
02:20:31,600 --> 02:20:34,020
5, 4, 6, 8?

2281
02:20:42,100 --> 02:20:44,320
We both...we are both wrong.

2282
02:20:47,180 --> 02:20:48,140
Oh my gosh, a private chat.

2283
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:49,600
Hi, you there?

2284
02:20:50,660 --> 02:20:51,920
Yeah, I was in the toilet.

2285
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:52,640
Hello?

2286
02:20:54,180 --> 02:20:54,660
OMGWTF?

2287
02:20:55,020 --> 02:20:56,100
No need that info.

2288
02:20:57,180 --> 02:20:58,360
Oh my gosh, this computer is great.

2289
02:20:58,540 --> 02:20:59,760
Please get your monitor fixed.

2290
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:00,960
How's that ear infection?

2291
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:02,040
It's fine.

2292
02:21:02,420 --> 02:21:02,760
Super.

2293
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:04,340
We can talk some other time.

2294
02:21:04,440 --> 02:21:04,960
Take care.

2295
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:06,140
Rocket ship.

2296
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:08,200
I forgot to tell you about...

2297
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:09,860
There's a spare key inside the safe.

2298
02:21:09,940 --> 02:21:10,920
If you need it sometime.

2299
02:21:11,820 --> 02:21:13,280
It opens all the doors and cages.

2300
02:21:13,540 --> 02:21:13,720
Oh.

2301
02:21:14,080 --> 02:21:14,940
Wow, that's handy.

2302
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:15,940
Nobody wins.

2303
02:21:15,960 --> 02:21:16,740
We all suck.

2304
02:21:17,080 --> 02:21:17,320
Yeah!

2305
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:22,040
2, 7, 5, 8, 1.

2306
02:21:22,120 --> 02:21:23,100
Everybody remember that.

2307
02:21:23,280 --> 02:21:24,280
2, 7, 5, 8, 1.

2308
02:21:24,360 --> 02:21:25,200
2, 7, 5, 8, 1.

2309
02:21:25,320 --> 02:21:26,220
2, 7, 5, 8, 1.

2310
02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:26,920
Okay.

2311
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:28,460
I don't think I need it at the moment.

2312
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:30,020
I already have one, but thanks.

2313
02:21:30,380 --> 02:21:30,540
Today.

2314
02:21:30,920 --> 02:21:31,840
Feeling much better today.

2315
02:21:32,020 --> 02:21:32,880
How's the bear doing?

2316
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:34,500
It keeps sucking that popsicle.

2317
02:21:34,720 --> 02:21:35,300
Is that normal?

2318
02:21:35,620 --> 02:21:36,300
I'm not sure.

2319
02:21:36,460 --> 02:21:37,680
But I like to watch.

2320
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:38,760
LOL.

2321
02:21:38,940 --> 02:21:40,980
Gotta go fix Calvin's cage.

2322
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:44,460
Wait, what was it?

2323
02:21:45,860 --> 02:21:46,220
2...

2324
02:21:46,860 --> 02:21:47,220
Wait.

2325
02:21:48,300 --> 02:21:49,620
2, 7, 5, 8, 1.

2326
02:21:54,470 --> 02:21:54,830
Yeah.

2327
02:21:56,270 --> 02:21:56,990
2...

2328
02:21:58,830 --> 02:21:59,550
2...

2329
02:22:00,370 --> 02:22:01,090
7...

2330
02:22:01,090 --> 02:22:01,670
5...

2331
02:22:02,630 --> 02:22:02,990
8...

2332
02:22:03,350 --> 02:22:03,750
1.

2333
02:22:04,010 --> 02:22:04,610
Got it.

2334
02:22:07,290 --> 02:22:08,970
Stop giving wrong numbers!

2335
02:22:09,970 --> 02:22:11,110
Take the key.

2336
02:22:11,110 --> 02:22:14,170
Yes, I'm the best little ninja lady.

2337
02:22:14,350 --> 02:22:15,310
I got the key.

2338
02:22:16,930 --> 02:22:18,510
You're so good at this game.

2339
02:22:19,030 --> 02:22:19,710
Miss Fortune.

2340
02:22:24,750 --> 02:22:25,890
Thank you.

2341
02:22:26,730 --> 02:22:27,430
Thank you.

2342
02:22:30,070 --> 02:22:30,870
Oh, the tea.

2343
02:22:31,430 --> 02:22:32,670
Do I smell tea?

2344
02:22:33,070 --> 02:22:33,730
Fancy!

2345
02:22:35,610 --> 02:22:36,370
Fancy!

2346
02:22:37,230 --> 02:22:38,350
Anything else?

2347
02:22:38,710 --> 02:22:39,810
What was in the bucket?

2348
02:22:41,110 --> 02:22:43,070
Any keys inside the bucket?

2349
02:22:45,130 --> 02:22:45,510
No.

2350
02:22:46,570 --> 02:22:48,350
We already got the keys, so let's head out.

2351
02:22:49,410 --> 02:22:50,030
Fancy!

2352
02:22:51,470 --> 02:22:53,110
And let's go to...

2353
02:22:53,110 --> 02:22:53,710
Not Calvin.

2354
02:22:53,930 --> 02:22:54,790
This guy's cage.

2355
02:22:55,030 --> 02:22:55,330
Gah!

2356
02:22:56,530 --> 02:22:57,110
Gah!

2357
02:22:57,690 --> 02:22:59,450
Is that why you guys were saying gah earlier?

2358
02:23:02,860 --> 02:23:04,990
I think we just let the wolf free.

2359
02:23:06,810 --> 02:23:07,790
Excuse me.

2360
02:23:09,690 --> 02:23:10,210
Uh...

2361
02:23:10,210 --> 02:23:15,090
Oh my god.

2362
02:23:15,230 --> 02:23:16,090
We're having a moment.

2363
02:23:16,250 --> 02:23:17,030
He's sniffing us.

2364
02:23:17,470 --> 02:23:18,150
We're having a moment.

2365
02:23:18,590 --> 02:23:19,330
Cleverly done.

2366
02:23:22,630 --> 02:23:26,670
You gotta let him sniff your hand.

2367
02:23:30,610 --> 02:23:31,130
No!

2368
02:23:32,410 --> 02:23:33,810
The wolf is free though.

2369
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:36,530
I'm gonna take it.

2370
02:23:36,710 --> 02:23:38,510
Now there's a bird invasion.

2371
02:23:38,750 --> 02:23:39,510
Actually, it's good.

2372
02:23:39,850 --> 02:23:42,750
We set the wolf free and he'll take care of the bird invasion.

2373
02:23:44,710 --> 02:23:44,890
Alright.

2374
02:23:45,390 --> 02:23:47,130
My evil cousin's address.

2375
02:23:47,330 --> 02:23:47,770
Fox.

2376
02:23:48,430 --> 02:23:49,430
Wait, I can't read.

2377
02:23:55,270 --> 02:23:55,790
Skogstigen.

2378
02:23:57,030 --> 02:23:57,550
Skogstigen.

2379
02:23:59,110 --> 02:23:59,390
Nice.

2380
02:24:01,050 --> 02:24:01,570
Doxt.

2381
02:24:04,470 --> 02:24:05,730
Alright, sweet.

2382
02:24:11,370 --> 02:24:11,930
Phantasmagoria!

2383
02:24:17,010 --> 02:24:17,570
Yippee!

2384
02:24:22,170 --> 02:24:26,870
I once pet a wolf and ever since then I can cosplay Venomstake so much better.

2385
02:24:33,810 --> 02:24:35,030
It's starting to get dark.

2386
02:24:43,150 --> 02:24:45,470
Skogstigen is Forest Road.

2387
02:24:45,830 --> 02:24:47,990
Have you ever heard this question before?

2388
02:24:49,150 --> 02:24:50,790
I don't think so.

2389
02:24:55,250 --> 02:24:56,390
Wait, which question?

2390
02:24:56,830 --> 02:24:57,250
Which one?

2391
02:24:57,970 --> 02:25:00,450
Yes, technically.

2392
02:25:04,290 --> 02:25:06,450
Yeah, I've lied to a friend.

2393
02:25:08,150 --> 02:25:11,370
All the time!

2394
02:25:26,390 --> 02:25:28,870
We're bad misfortune now.

2395
02:25:29,450 --> 02:25:31,150
Oh, seeing someone?

2396
02:25:32,310 --> 02:25:35,970
We saw dead people, but did we see anybody die?

2397
02:25:42,010 --> 02:25:45,110
We've seen dead people, but I don't think we've seen anyone die.

2398
02:25:46,650 --> 02:25:47,710
Oh, the puppy!

2399
02:25:48,370 --> 02:25:49,690
Oh yeah, you're right.

2400
02:25:49,830 --> 02:25:50,630
We saw the puppy.

2401
02:25:56,610 --> 02:25:59,390
There's so many missing children posters.

2402
02:26:05,610 --> 02:26:06,810
You're welcome.

2403
02:26:09,590 --> 02:26:10,190
Phantasmagoria!

2404
02:26:12,070 --> 02:26:14,950
We saw the hamster, but that was inside.

2405
02:26:15,030 --> 02:26:16,290
We only saw the ketchup after.

2406
02:26:17,510 --> 02:26:18,610
Oh my gosh!

2407
02:26:23,030 --> 02:26:24,390
Tuck's hair behind here.

2408
02:26:25,330 --> 02:26:26,030
Hi handsome!

2409
02:26:26,430 --> 02:26:27,610
Oh my gosh, you guys.

2410
02:26:27,830 --> 02:26:28,030
Wait.

2411
02:26:29,450 --> 02:26:32,090
Oh my gosh, I didn't think that...

2412
02:26:32,090 --> 02:26:35,030
Someone so...

2413
02:26:39,070 --> 02:26:42,310
He's just so tall and spooky.

2414
02:26:42,830 --> 02:26:44,030
And I didn't think that...

2415
02:26:45,830 --> 02:26:48,070
Guys, how do I look?

2416
02:26:48,530 --> 02:26:49,390
Is there anything in my teeth?

2417
02:26:51,630 --> 02:26:52,470
Is there anything in my teeth?

2418
02:26:54,830 --> 02:26:56,290
Does my hair look okay?

2419
02:26:56,290 --> 02:26:59,290
Do you think if I talk to them they'll be like...

2420
02:27:00,390 --> 02:27:02,190
Okay, I'm gonna go shoot my shot.

2421
02:27:06,570 --> 02:27:06,950
Oh my gosh!

2422
02:27:07,170 --> 02:27:07,750
Miss Fortune, please!

2423
02:27:16,070 --> 02:27:18,790
Why couldn't you do that with the zoo?

2424
02:27:18,790 --> 02:27:20,970
Don't play with my feelings.

2425
02:27:21,290 --> 02:27:22,650
It can't be a ticket.

2426
02:27:24,850 --> 02:27:26,770
Only you had your 3.0.

2427
02:27:27,070 --> 02:27:27,250
I know.

2428
02:27:29,970 --> 02:27:31,650
He's gonna be like your doll.

2429
02:27:32,530 --> 02:27:33,910
I need a new shiny Mento.

2430
02:27:34,650 --> 02:27:36,290
Okay, come back tomorrow.

2431
02:27:37,150 --> 02:27:38,130
And I'll be beautiful!

2432
02:27:39,450 --> 02:27:39,870
What's this?

2433
02:27:42,610 --> 02:27:43,210
Creepy!

2434
02:27:45,250 --> 02:27:45,850
Cute!

2435
02:27:46,430 --> 02:27:47,830
Oh my gosh.

2436
02:27:48,210 --> 02:27:50,910
Oh, we can...we can shine this.

2437
02:28:01,650 --> 02:28:02,710
Let's grab our ticket.

2438
02:28:06,630 --> 02:28:09,390
Sweet and spooky!

2439
02:28:09,570 --> 02:28:10,870
Oh my gosh, that's just like me!

2440
02:28:12,530 --> 02:28:14,370
You're welcome, Miss Fortune.

2441
02:28:14,830 --> 02:28:16,390
I didn't thank you.

2442
02:28:17,590 --> 02:28:19,490
I thanked the universe.

2443
02:28:20,110 --> 02:28:20,730
Not you though.

2444
02:28:20,890 --> 02:28:21,210
Wait!

2445
02:28:22,470 --> 02:28:23,430
We can talk to him.

2446
02:28:24,590 --> 02:28:25,210
A ghost?

2447
02:28:25,990 --> 02:28:27,270
Damn, that's creepy.

2448
02:28:27,810 --> 02:28:31,270
Miss Fortune, please, mind your language.

2449
02:28:31,590 --> 02:28:32,770
But I got scared.

2450
02:28:32,930 --> 02:28:34,610
It's totally understandable.

2451
02:28:35,050 --> 02:28:36,570
That's no excuse.

2452
02:28:41,490 --> 02:28:42,770
Damn shame.

2453
02:28:45,570 --> 02:28:48,130
It's okay, I'm used to being called creepy.

2454
02:28:50,010 --> 02:28:51,210
It's like...

2455
02:28:51,610 --> 02:28:53,650
The best compliment ever.

2456
02:28:57,570 --> 02:28:59,130
Thank you, Miss Fortune.

2457
02:29:02,070 --> 02:29:04,050
My soul is so happy.

2458
02:29:05,070 --> 02:29:05,750
Thank you.

2459
02:29:09,970 --> 02:29:11,490
I love being creepy.

2460
02:29:12,590 --> 02:29:13,470
A creepy clown?

2461
02:29:13,950 --> 02:29:14,790
That's creepy.

2462
02:29:15,010 --> 02:29:16,810
Okay, but creepy clowns suck.

2463
02:29:17,190 --> 02:29:18,010
Creepy ghosts...

2464
02:29:18,010 --> 02:29:18,490
What's this?

2465
02:29:19,150 --> 02:29:19,630
Balloons.

2466
02:29:25,630 --> 02:29:27,290
Do you think she loves balloons?

2467
02:29:29,390 --> 02:29:31,250
She's trying to get another thing out of the area.

2468
02:29:35,810 --> 02:29:36,350
Okay.

2469
02:29:39,270 --> 02:29:40,310
The balloon just disappeared.

2470
02:29:42,350 --> 02:29:43,430
Creepy clowns...

2471
02:29:43,430 --> 02:29:44,490
Hot dogs!

2472
02:29:44,810 --> 02:29:45,410
Oh my gosh.

2473
02:29:49,870 --> 02:29:50,950
I added...

2474
02:29:51,810 --> 02:29:52,830
That reminds me.

2475
02:29:52,890 --> 02:29:55,590
I added a new Streamlabs donation sound.

2476
02:29:57,110 --> 02:29:57,650
Glitter?

2477
02:29:57,770 --> 02:29:59,010
I already did the glitter, you guys.

2478
02:29:59,070 --> 02:29:59,710
I already did it.

2479
02:30:06,540 --> 02:30:07,980
Arm corve.

2480
02:30:08,340 --> 02:30:09,160
My favorite.

2481
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:17,920
Yeah.

2482
02:30:18,260 --> 02:30:19,080
And now?

2483
02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:21,800
Did you now?

2484
02:30:24,100 --> 02:30:25,000
Thanks for the donation.

2485
02:30:26,020 --> 02:30:27,460
Well, thanks for the hot dogs.

2486
02:30:30,140 --> 02:30:31,960
Rolling for new Minto sound.

2487
02:30:34,300 --> 02:30:34,740
Ah!

2488
02:30:47,260 --> 02:30:48,360
Oh my gosh.

2489
02:30:48,380 --> 02:30:49,660
And it's even a fox!

2490
02:30:51,400 --> 02:30:52,280
I screamed.

2491
02:30:52,440 --> 02:30:53,240
That got me actually.

2492
02:30:53,460 --> 02:30:55,780
I didn't expect to get jump scared in this game.

2493
02:30:56,100 --> 02:30:57,620
So it actually got me so much.

2494
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:01,820
Rolling for Minto.

2495
02:31:03,480 --> 02:31:05,600
Looks like normal Benjamin to me.

2496
02:31:06,820 --> 02:31:08,100
Happy Benjamin!

2497
02:31:10,320 --> 02:31:14,220
Well, if I say Chu gacha I'll get the other sound.

2498
02:31:20,180 --> 02:31:21,320
Oh my gosh.

2499
02:31:21,720 --> 02:31:22,680
Notif sound gacha.

2500
02:31:24,880 --> 02:31:26,100
It's kinda quiet though.

2501
02:31:48,550 --> 02:31:50,710
This will be the new Dono sound.

2502
02:31:54,150 --> 02:31:55,010
Pumpkin head!

2503
02:31:56,250 --> 02:31:57,030
Oh my gosh.

2504
02:31:57,070 --> 02:31:58,350
All these tall ass people.

2505
02:31:59,670 --> 02:32:01,250
What's wrong with having a pumpkin head?

2506
02:32:04,510 --> 02:32:06,810
But my head is not very pumpkin like.

2507
02:32:06,810 --> 02:32:07,690
It's delightful.

2508
02:32:18,350 --> 02:32:21,790
Miss Fortune, don't eat the candy off the ground.

2509
02:32:24,030 --> 02:32:24,510
Ew!

2510
02:32:26,770 --> 02:32:28,070
Are you really gonna eat some of it?

2511
02:32:29,090 --> 02:32:30,130
Ah, YOLO.

2512
02:32:30,270 --> 02:32:31,050
Yeah, you know what?

2513
02:32:50,610 --> 02:32:51,730
Wait, what's going on?

2514
02:32:52,550 --> 02:32:54,250
Maybe I shouldn't have eaten the candy.

2515
02:32:54,830 --> 02:32:55,650
No hot dog.

2516
02:32:56,710 --> 02:32:57,850
Ah, no hot dog.

2517
02:32:57,990 --> 02:32:58,610
Oh my god!

2518
02:32:59,870 --> 02:33:03,950
No, we are having a nightmare this time.

2519
02:33:04,370 --> 02:33:06,930
I've never seen... Wait, I don't think I...

2520
02:33:06,930 --> 02:33:09,410
Oh, her dad is a straw man.

2521
02:33:11,730 --> 02:33:13,090
Her dad is on fire!

2522
02:33:14,050 --> 02:33:15,830
And we are eating...

2523
02:33:15,830 --> 02:33:18,770
Oh no, her poor heart.

2524
02:33:19,530 --> 02:33:20,850
Oh, Miss Fortune.

2525
02:33:23,210 --> 02:33:23,850
No!

2526
02:33:24,810 --> 02:33:26,370
What kind of candy was this?

2527
02:33:27,210 --> 02:33:28,150
Oh gosh.

2528
02:33:32,650 --> 02:33:37,630
I think it maybe was like the disease on the ground, not the candy.

2529
02:33:40,630 --> 02:33:43,190
I think we are...

2530
02:33:43,190 --> 02:33:44,550
Some happiness to Miss Fortune.

2531
02:33:45,770 --> 02:33:47,390
See, we are fine guys.

2532
02:33:48,690 --> 02:33:50,190
That's just some...

2533
02:33:53,190 --> 02:33:55,230
Can we go to the horror house?

2534
02:33:56,130 --> 02:33:58,750
Ok, there was the carousel, there was the horror house.

2535
02:33:58,890 --> 02:33:59,290
What else is there?

2536
02:34:05,470 --> 02:34:07,150
Maybe you should try stilts too.

2537
02:34:07,250 --> 02:34:08,270
You might reach Miss Fortune.

2538
02:34:08,270 --> 02:34:12,250
You should use stilts so you can reach the matters.

2539
02:34:14,030 --> 02:34:15,150
What the hell?

2540
02:34:15,870 --> 02:34:17,470
Why am I taking strides like this?

2541
02:34:18,810 --> 02:34:20,190
Wait, what is this one?

2542
02:34:20,370 --> 02:34:22,410
Ok, so I think it's just...

2543
02:34:22,410 --> 02:34:23,850
Oh wait, can we get the hot dog?

2544
02:34:24,350 --> 02:34:24,970
Or no?

2545
02:34:26,310 --> 02:34:27,310
No, we can't.

2546
02:34:34,050 --> 02:34:36,070
Thanks for the raid.

2547
02:34:36,190 --> 02:34:36,590
Thank you!

2548
02:34:36,590 --> 02:34:40,090
Welcome, welcome.

2549
02:34:40,210 --> 02:34:44,090
We are like in the middle of this creepy, silly game but...

2550
02:34:44,090 --> 02:34:45,010
Hello, welcome!

2551
02:34:45,290 --> 02:34:46,550
Thanks for the 5 gift card!

2552
02:34:48,150 --> 02:34:50,030
We are about to go in a haunted house!

2553
02:34:50,350 --> 02:34:52,750
Oh my gosh, I hope it's really spooky.

2554
02:34:54,190 --> 02:34:55,550
Wait, where did the door go?

2555
02:34:55,810 --> 02:34:56,230
Oh there it is.

2556
02:35:00,270 --> 02:35:01,110
Haunted house!

2557
02:35:03,630 --> 02:35:05,530
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2558
02:35:07,290 --> 02:35:10,010
Alright then, have a pleasant ride.

2559
02:35:10,290 --> 02:35:10,910
Emily, hello!

2560
02:35:11,530 --> 02:35:12,350
Thank you for the hot dog!

2561
02:35:12,590 --> 02:35:14,630
Oh no, I think I bought too many hot dogs.

2562
02:35:16,170 --> 02:35:16,650
Spooky!

2563
02:35:21,010 --> 02:35:23,670
Oh my gosh, it's like a... Oh my gosh, this is my dream.

2564
02:35:24,010 --> 02:35:25,330
A haunted roller coaster?

2565
02:35:27,590 --> 02:35:28,670
Don't drink that.

2566
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:36,320
Aliens!

2567
02:35:36,580 --> 02:35:37,700
You are pretty good.

2568
02:35:39,500 --> 02:35:39,880
Wow!

2569
02:35:45,480 --> 02:35:47,060
Maybe she didn't like it.

2570
02:35:51,800 --> 02:35:52,800
Don't throw up.

2571
02:35:55,540 --> 02:35:59,020
Actually, maybe it would be good if she did puke and get the candy out of her system.

2572
02:35:59,020 --> 02:36:02,420
Take a deep breath and you will soon feel better.

2573
02:36:06,540 --> 02:36:07,600
Good, good.

2574
02:36:07,820 --> 02:36:09,480
Now, let's go find the hot dog.

2575
02:36:09,480 --> 02:36:14,680
You know, actually, how you can stop yourself from throwing up is by humming.

2576
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:19,100
Whenever I feel like I'm going to throw up, I just start humming.

2577
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:24,520
It actually helps because you can't throw up and hum at the same time.

2578
02:36:27,540 --> 02:36:28,320
Wait, really?

2579
02:36:28,420 --> 02:36:28,640
Yeah.

2580
02:36:29,620 --> 02:36:31,520
So I just go like...

2581
02:36:37,850 --> 02:36:39,450
Yeah, it's actually like so easy.

2582
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:47,760
My life hack or after life...

2583
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:48,280
Kira!

2584
02:36:48,960 --> 02:36:50,320
My after life hack.

2585
02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:53,300
Kira the ghost!

2586
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:55,960
Time to go.

2587
02:36:56,320 --> 02:36:57,600
I like the way she gallops away.

2588
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:01,980
Can I play one?

2589
02:37:05,400 --> 02:37:05,840
Yeah!

2590
02:37:07,440 --> 02:37:08,580
Just swallow it.

2591
02:37:09,540 --> 02:37:10,720
Hot dog!

2592
02:37:11,480 --> 02:37:12,420
Trying for Arona.

2593
02:37:13,620 --> 02:37:16,000
Oh, it is kind of like the Arona hot dog.

2594
02:37:16,940 --> 02:37:18,340
Ok, we got Massacre.

2595
02:37:19,140 --> 02:37:21,700
Danger now with real bullets.

2596
02:37:22,420 --> 02:37:23,300
Whack-a-Fox.

2597
02:37:25,380 --> 02:37:26,100
Fortuna.

2598
02:37:29,340 --> 02:37:29,900
Advance.

2599
02:37:30,180 --> 02:37:30,640
Happy Halloween.

2600
02:37:30,840 --> 02:37:31,420
Spoopy ghost.

2601
02:37:31,800 --> 02:37:32,860
Thanks, Loli!

2602
02:37:34,040 --> 02:37:34,600
Rewards?

2603
02:37:35,160 --> 02:37:36,980
Wait, we can get another stone.

2604
02:37:38,360 --> 02:37:39,980
Happiness to the ghost.

2605
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:41,300
Wait, I missed.

2606
02:37:41,880 --> 02:37:44,740
Happiness to the ghost and the skellies.

2607
02:37:46,280 --> 02:37:46,840
Cute.

2608
02:37:47,220 --> 02:37:48,260
Oh my gosh, so cute.

2609
02:37:51,480 --> 02:37:52,700
Any other happiness?

2610
02:37:52,900 --> 02:37:53,860
These are so cute too.

2611
02:37:53,860 --> 02:37:55,980
Can I get a balloon?

2612
02:38:06,360 --> 02:38:08,020
Oh no, I think he's...

2613
02:38:12,840 --> 02:38:14,240
Take my balloon.

2614
02:38:23,860 --> 02:38:25,520
I think he did that on purpose.

2615
02:38:25,880 --> 02:38:27,680
Ok guys, we can get our fortune told.

2616
02:38:29,020 --> 02:38:29,820
We can...

2617
02:38:29,820 --> 02:38:30,840
Whack-a-Fox?

2618
02:38:31,560 --> 02:38:32,720
Actually, I want to play Massacre.

2619
02:38:32,940 --> 02:38:33,900
I don't know why I'm asking.

2620
02:38:37,380 --> 02:38:37,780
Massacre!

2621
02:38:38,100 --> 02:38:38,940
Oh, it's free too.

2622
02:38:39,140 --> 02:38:39,640
Ok, nice.

2623
02:38:42,540 --> 02:38:44,300
One talent is that I can throw up on command.

2624
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:49,600
Bounce!

2625
02:38:59,230 --> 02:38:59,710
Oh!

2626
02:39:01,710 --> 02:39:03,050
Oh my god, it's on fire!

2627
02:39:05,510 --> 02:39:07,530
Did no one else try playing it?

2628
02:39:08,630 --> 02:39:10,530
Good thing nobody was behind it.

2629
02:39:10,730 --> 02:39:11,750
How about Whack-a-Fox?

2630
02:39:12,170 --> 02:39:24,050
Oh my gosh, I can't wait.

2631
02:39:31,230 --> 02:39:32,830
Dangerous foxes.

2632
02:39:33,510 --> 02:39:34,310
Ok!

2633
02:39:35,090 --> 02:39:35,950
Whack them!

2634
02:39:42,050 --> 02:39:45,430
My reflexes are like a cat.

2635
02:39:50,230 --> 02:39:51,370
Only one?

2636
02:39:52,270 --> 02:39:52,590
Like

2637
02:39:56,940 --> 02:39:57,600
9 hits.

2638
02:39:58,600 --> 02:39:59,260
Play again?

2639
02:39:59,360 --> 02:39:59,900
Yes, yes.

2640
02:39:59,960 --> 02:40:00,380
Play again!

2641
02:40:00,440 --> 02:40:00,860
Play again!

2642
02:40:00,860 --> 02:40:00,980
Play again!

2643
02:40:10,440 --> 02:40:10,860
Reflexes!

2644
02:40:14,620 --> 02:40:15,600
Guys, we're fine.

2645
02:40:20,080 --> 02:40:20,500
Guys...

2646
02:40:21,140 --> 02:40:23,440
Something... There was dust in my eye.

2647
02:40:23,560 --> 02:40:24,660
There was dust in my eye.

2648
02:40:25,520 --> 02:40:26,960
Ghosts like... Ok, one more!

2649
02:40:27,020 --> 02:40:27,280
One more!

2650
02:40:28,140 --> 02:40:29,200
I'll beat my high score.

2651
02:40:29,580 --> 02:40:30,900
I'll beat my high score of 9.

2652
02:40:31,700 --> 02:40:32,100
Sorry.

2653
02:40:44,370 --> 02:40:45,610
Ok, I'm going to beat my high score.

2654
02:40:46,030 --> 02:40:46,930
I'm regressing.

2655
02:40:47,130 --> 02:40:47,670
I'm regressing.

2656
02:40:49,430 --> 02:40:50,750
I'm regressing for real?

2657
02:41:10,820 --> 02:41:12,940
It's gotta be... I can dance with it.

2658
02:41:13,060 --> 02:41:13,720
Ok, hold on.

2659
02:41:13,880 --> 02:41:15,700
Ok, I'm going to beat my score now for real.

2660
02:41:15,700 --> 02:41:16,460
Ok!

2661
02:41:18,460 --> 02:41:18,860
I

2662
02:41:32,810 --> 02:41:35,470
think I got the highest score you can get in this game.

2663
02:41:39,430 --> 02:41:40,750
4 is a spooky number.

2664
02:41:43,230 --> 02:41:44,930
9 is probably the max, maybe.

2665
02:41:45,370 --> 02:41:45,770
Probably.

2666
02:41:46,210 --> 02:41:47,490
I'm just that good at the game.

2667
02:41:48,130 --> 02:41:49,130
Can I get my fortune told?

2668
02:41:53,990 --> 02:41:54,390
Yes!

2669
02:41:54,670 --> 02:41:56,450
Oh wait, I have to use my reward ticket.

2670
02:41:57,390 --> 02:41:58,430
We can always get another one.

2671
02:42:05,260 --> 02:42:09,100
Ramirez Alejandra, and I want to know the future of me.

2672
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:10,360
Please, thank you.

2673
02:42:10,920 --> 02:42:11,400
Thank you.

2674
02:42:14,040 --> 02:42:17,960
Once you see the beyond, the beyond sees you.

2675
02:42:18,540 --> 02:42:21,360
And you can be sure it will be coming for you.

2676
02:42:21,960 --> 02:42:24,280
The beyond is coming for me?

2677
02:42:25,280 --> 02:42:26,380
What's the beyond?

2678
02:42:26,680 --> 02:42:27,880
Want to try again?

2679
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:29,760
Oh...

2680
02:42:35,950 --> 02:42:36,890
There's more?

2681
02:42:37,070 --> 02:42:37,990
Ok, I'll try it again.

2682
02:42:41,680 --> 02:42:43,280
We can always get more tickets.

2683
02:42:46,800 --> 02:42:52,620
What you see in the beyond is not what you see, but what you don't see.

2684
02:42:53,580 --> 02:42:54,240
Really?

2685
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:56,180
Talk about crazy.

2686
02:42:56,400 --> 02:42:56,940
Crazy.

2687
02:42:57,500 --> 02:43:01,340
Yeah, I see the doll in the reward machine.

2688
02:43:01,440 --> 02:43:02,380
Don't worry, I'll get it.

2689
02:43:04,180 --> 02:43:05,240
Let's try one more.

2690
02:43:10,680 --> 02:43:12,280
Talk about crazy.

2691
02:43:29,420 --> 02:43:31,400
Get all your fortunes told.

2692
02:43:31,500 --> 02:43:32,320
Oh my gosh!

2693
02:43:33,720 --> 02:43:34,340
I got achievement.

2694
02:43:37,960 --> 02:43:41,200
Yeah, probably.

2695
02:43:44,400 --> 02:43:45,600
Too bad.

2696
02:43:45,820 --> 02:43:47,860
You didn't seem very sincere about that, huh?

2697
02:43:52,020 --> 02:43:53,700
It crashed.

2698
02:43:54,700 --> 02:43:56,820
Glitter to the crashed bird.

2699
02:44:00,320 --> 02:44:01,700
Three tickets!

2700
02:44:08,400 --> 02:44:12,300
Ok, we can get the golden chocolate coin.

2701
02:44:13,700 --> 02:44:14,960
So we'll get that.

2702
02:44:20,280 --> 02:44:20,680
Yummy!

2703
02:44:20,680 --> 02:44:20,740
Yummy.

2704
02:44:21,640 --> 02:44:22,200
Alright.

2705
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:27,500
Ok, now let's go get five more tickets.

2706
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:31,120
Let's go get five more tickets.

2707
02:44:31,880 --> 02:44:32,480
We got this.

2708
02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:33,720
We got this.

2709
02:44:34,920 --> 02:44:36,360
We can play as many times as we want.

2710
02:44:36,580 --> 02:44:37,300
Yeah, play the game.

2711
02:44:38,420 --> 02:44:40,000
Ok, five more.

2712
02:44:40,100 --> 02:44:40,500
Five more.

2713
02:44:41,580 --> 02:44:42,620
I'm locked in.

2714
02:44:48,170 --> 02:44:49,370
I'm locked in.

2715
02:44:53,830 --> 02:44:55,050
I'm locked in.

2716
02:44:55,550 --> 02:44:57,070
Nine, baby!

2717
02:44:57,990 --> 02:44:59,070
Alright, play again.

2718
02:44:59,190 --> 02:44:59,410
Yeah!

2719
02:45:00,130 --> 02:45:00,570
Again!

2720
02:45:00,710 --> 02:45:00,930
Again!

2721
02:45:02,370 --> 02:45:02,810
What?

2722
02:45:05,090 --> 02:45:05,850
What do you mean I missed?

2723
02:45:06,150 --> 02:45:07,210
What do you mean I missed?

2724
02:45:12,370 --> 02:45:13,490
How did I miss?

2725
02:45:15,790 --> 02:45:16,230
What?

2726
02:45:19,790 --> 02:45:21,270
How did I miss that one though?

2727
02:45:21,310 --> 02:45:22,490
It threw me off completely.

2728
02:45:33,780 --> 02:45:34,560
Oh shoot!

2729
02:45:38,460 --> 02:45:39,480
Still got a ticket.

2730
02:45:39,620 --> 02:45:40,600
Yeah, I guess you're right.

2731
02:45:40,740 --> 02:45:41,720
Ok, now we have three.

2732
02:45:42,820 --> 02:45:43,980
Play two more times.

2733
02:45:49,870 --> 02:45:51,130
I'm too slow.

2734
02:45:53,230 --> 02:45:54,390
My reflexes today.

2735
02:45:58,390 --> 02:46:01,370
Usually I have reflexes like crazy, you guys.

2736
02:46:01,470 --> 02:46:02,250
Don't worry about it.

2737
02:46:03,050 --> 02:46:04,010
Alright, one more.

2738
02:46:04,010 --> 02:46:06,890
What do you do?

2739
02:46:07,970 --> 02:46:10,510
How did I miss?

2740
02:46:15,010 --> 02:46:17,110
How did you miss?

2741
02:46:17,190 --> 02:46:18,390
I got it correct!

2742
02:46:19,970 --> 02:46:20,730
Oh,

2743
02:46:25,290 --> 02:46:26,610
it won't even...

2744
02:46:26,610 --> 02:46:28,090
Win all reward tickets.

2745
02:46:32,130 --> 02:46:34,470
It won't even allow you to get anymore.

2746
02:46:36,630 --> 02:46:38,230
We cleared out the machine.

2747
02:46:41,150 --> 02:46:41,970
Maxed out, baby.

2748
02:46:42,630 --> 02:46:44,510
The most important one, the stoneware.

2749
02:46:48,270 --> 02:46:49,010
Say ten!

2750
02:46:49,130 --> 02:46:50,210
Thanks for the five gifts!

2751
02:46:50,590 --> 02:46:51,350
Oh my gosh!

2752
02:46:56,050 --> 02:46:56,970
Get it?

2753
02:46:56,990 --> 02:46:57,550
Because he's a rock.

2754
02:46:58,270 --> 02:46:58,930
And our doll.

2755
02:47:00,010 --> 02:47:02,490
Oh, one of those dolls again.

2756
02:47:02,730 --> 02:47:03,950
I want it.

2757
02:47:05,350 --> 02:47:11,670
Reality will transform into what the child desires the most.

2758
02:47:11,950 --> 02:47:12,530
Really?

2759
02:47:12,810 --> 02:47:14,890
Thanks for the ten gifts!

2760
02:47:15,290 --> 02:47:16,070
Thank you so much!

2761
02:47:19,010 --> 02:47:20,810
I like desires.

2762
02:47:22,130 --> 02:47:22,910
Nothing.

2763
02:47:24,130 --> 02:47:25,830
Why can't he see...oh buy everything.

2764
02:47:25,950 --> 02:47:26,590
Rich lady.

2765
02:47:26,590 --> 02:47:29,610
Why can't he see the dolls, I wonder.

2766
02:47:31,110 --> 02:47:32,930
I want to see the happy ghost one more time.

2767
02:47:38,430 --> 02:47:39,950
Let's keep on going.

2768
02:47:41,650 --> 02:47:42,690
Swan Lake.

2769
02:47:46,990 --> 02:47:48,590
No, our chocolate coin!

2770
02:47:50,090 --> 02:47:51,970
Or is that Swam Lake?

2771
02:47:54,610 --> 02:47:55,890
Swam Lake.

2772
02:48:01,070 --> 02:48:02,730
I'll take the next boat.

2773
02:48:04,030 --> 02:48:05,550
Surely it's a Halloween costume.

2774
02:48:09,870 --> 02:48:11,030
Thanks forever!

2775
02:48:12,330 --> 02:48:13,610
Thanks for four months caffeine!

2776
02:48:24,790 --> 02:48:25,890
One golden coin.

2777
02:48:36,550 --> 02:48:38,150
Why is she so violent?

2778
02:48:39,110 --> 02:48:40,390
You don't have to throw it at him.

2779
02:48:41,050 --> 02:48:42,090
Yeah, let's leave on the boat.

2780
02:48:42,110 --> 02:48:42,790
I think we got everything.

2781
02:48:49,970 --> 02:48:51,710
Oh yeah, those birds sucked.

2782
02:48:51,850 --> 02:48:52,610
The Kraken?

2783
02:48:54,490 --> 02:48:55,570
What's a Kraken with you?

2784
02:49:02,590 --> 02:49:03,390
Why don't...

2785
02:49:06,490 --> 02:49:09,110
Why don't you just explain it to her while you're on the boat?

2786
02:49:12,990 --> 02:49:18,830
Oh Kraken, if you appear in front of me, I will see you.

2787
02:49:19,450 --> 02:49:22,890
And if I see you, I will know it's you.

2788
02:49:24,090 --> 02:49:28,550
Sweet Kraken, come up in front of me right now.

2789
02:49:30,210 --> 02:49:32,070
What's a freaking Kraken?

2790
02:49:32,470 --> 02:49:34,030
She really is thinking about it forever.

2791
02:49:34,110 --> 02:49:35,790
This place is very quiet.

2792
02:49:36,130 --> 02:49:37,690
Is one allowed to talk?

2793
02:49:37,970 --> 02:49:39,070
It's getting awfully foggy.

2794
02:49:39,070 --> 02:49:43,810
Anyway, I was thinking, is the Kraken available for petting?

2795
02:49:44,130 --> 02:49:48,010
You know like, some pet doggies, some pet kitties.

2796
02:49:48,310 --> 02:49:51,010
I want to pet the Kraken, if it's possible.

2797
02:49:51,630 --> 02:49:54,550
Well, I heard you can lure it out with fish.

2798
02:49:54,810 --> 02:49:55,910
With fish you say?

2799
02:49:56,190 --> 02:49:58,210
Look Rodrigo, we need to talk.

2800
02:49:58,490 --> 02:50:02,050
I don't know what the Kraken is, but I'm very curious.

2801
02:50:02,210 --> 02:50:05,990
So I'll just place you here and see what happens.

2802
02:50:05,990 --> 02:50:07,150
Oh my God.

2803
02:50:08,370 --> 02:50:09,550
What's gonna happen?

2804
02:50:10,990 --> 02:50:11,530
Rodrigo!

2805
02:50:13,910 --> 02:50:15,090
What is this?

2806
02:50:18,010 --> 02:50:19,370
Oh my God, the Kraken!

2807
02:50:30,490 --> 02:50:33,010
We got rid of Rodrigo so fast.

2808
02:50:33,230 --> 02:50:35,010
We kept on to him this whole time.

2809
02:50:35,990 --> 02:50:36,910
We did that all day.

2810
02:50:36,910 --> 02:50:38,830
It's not my fault.

2811
02:50:39,270 --> 02:50:40,950
The fox stole it.

2812
02:50:41,010 --> 02:50:41,630
The fox?

2813
02:50:42,010 --> 02:50:42,510
Yeah, right.

2814
02:50:42,950 --> 02:50:47,290
Hey, Mysterious, are you taking me now to the house of Benjamin?

2815
02:50:47,850 --> 02:50:51,510
You know, that blue-eyed, soft, fluffy fox.

2816
02:50:51,630 --> 02:50:53,430
F for Rodrigo, I know it.

2817
02:50:53,570 --> 02:50:55,430
And stole my happiness?

2818
02:50:57,290 --> 02:51:00,010
You don't seem to want to talk about it.

2819
02:51:00,330 --> 02:51:02,650
And why is that you collect coins?

2820
02:51:02,650 --> 02:51:05,870
That's how you pay for your rent and food, right?

2821
02:51:05,950 --> 02:51:06,950
That was a chocolate coin.

2822
02:51:07,050 --> 02:51:08,450
It's probably delicious.

2823
02:51:09,610 --> 02:51:11,730
No, he wants to hear.

2824
02:51:12,210 --> 02:51:14,530
Anyway, do you like to eat Sushi?

2825
02:51:14,750 --> 02:51:16,030
Do you know about Sushi?

2826
02:51:16,390 --> 02:51:18,270
Because I have a Japanese ghost friend.

2827
02:51:18,270 --> 02:51:19,270
Oh, she said Japanese.

2828
02:51:19,470 --> 02:51:21,130
Anyway, can you speak Japanese?

2829
02:51:21,710 --> 02:51:23,170
I need some translations.

2830
02:51:23,750 --> 02:51:24,890
Do you know what this means?

2831
02:51:25,270 --> 02:51:25,550
Where is Kiri?

2832
02:51:28,130 --> 02:51:29,730
So you don't know, huh?

2833
02:51:30,050 --> 02:51:30,490
You know?

2834
02:51:30,490 --> 02:51:33,890
I've never been outside this late by myself.

2835
02:51:34,170 --> 02:51:37,530
Do you go outside by yourself this late everyday?

2836
02:51:38,030 --> 02:51:40,210
Are you going to eat my chocolate coin?

2837
02:51:40,550 --> 02:51:42,230
Because I'm a bit hungry.

2838
02:51:43,490 --> 02:51:44,610
Stop talking!

2839
02:51:45,030 --> 02:51:46,770
Why should I stop talking?

2840
02:51:47,010 --> 02:51:48,510
Nobody else is talking.

2841
02:51:48,950 --> 02:51:51,450
Hey, Mysterious, where are you going?

2842
02:51:52,450 --> 02:51:54,170
He's just like, I can't take it anymore!

2843
02:51:54,530 --> 02:51:54,730
Hello?

2844
02:51:54,730 --> 02:51:55,290
Can you swim?

2845
02:51:55,650 --> 02:51:56,070
Hello?

2846
02:52:00,490 --> 02:52:01,430
No way!

2847
02:52:01,570 --> 02:52:04,870
He just dropped ship because she wouldn't shut up.

2848
02:52:05,270 --> 02:52:05,710
Ah, stupid.

2849
02:52:06,250 --> 02:52:08,010
I'm pretty sure he'll be fine.

2850
02:52:09,230 --> 02:52:10,710
Look, we have arrived.

2851
02:52:15,250 --> 02:52:16,530
Oh, we made it.

2852
02:52:22,470 --> 02:52:23,790
No, my ride!

2853
02:52:23,790 --> 02:52:26,210
No, my ride!

2854
02:52:29,810 --> 02:52:30,410
Ok.

2855
02:52:31,330 --> 02:52:33,470
Guys, the music is awfully spooky here.

2856
02:52:34,470 --> 02:52:36,110
There's a bunch of toys here.

2857
02:52:36,670 --> 02:52:37,470
Check that out.

2858
02:52:37,730 --> 02:52:39,150
It's the toy graveyard.

2859
02:52:39,430 --> 02:52:40,290
I'm telling you.

2860
02:52:40,350 --> 02:52:41,070
I'm telling you.

2861
02:52:44,810 --> 02:52:46,630
Glitter to the toy graveyard.

2862
02:52:47,230 --> 02:52:48,250
Why is it so spooky?

2863
02:52:48,310 --> 02:52:49,310
What time is it?

2864
02:52:49,610 --> 02:52:51,070
It's getting really dark.

2865
02:52:52,170 --> 02:52:54,430
Mr. Voice, are you there?

2866
02:52:54,990 --> 02:52:55,470
Hello?

2867
02:52:56,270 --> 02:52:57,830
There's something wrong here.

2868
02:52:58,450 --> 02:53:00,010
Something very wrong.

2869
02:53:00,210 --> 02:53:01,790
What's wrong, Mr. Voice?

2870
02:53:01,990 --> 02:53:02,990
What do you mean?

2871
02:53:03,230 --> 02:53:03,830
It's coming.

2872
02:53:04,230 --> 02:53:04,390
Hide.

2873
02:53:04,730 --> 02:53:04,990
Hide.

2874
02:53:05,210 --> 02:53:09,670
I don't know why you're playing, but if you scare me, I'll close my eyes.

2875
02:53:11,830 --> 02:53:14,150
Oh my gosh, the Barbie with the head cut off is so spooky.

2876
02:53:14,710 --> 02:53:15,330
What do you mean hide?

2877
02:53:15,990 --> 02:53:16,470
Hero!

2878
02:53:16,470 --> 02:53:16,570
Hero!

2879
02:53:23,550 --> 02:53:24,950
That

2880
02:53:28,050 --> 02:53:30,830
was some good hopping.

2881
02:53:31,490 --> 02:53:34,030
We're going.

2882
02:53:34,210 --> 02:53:34,750
We're going.

2883
02:53:40,290 --> 02:53:43,790
Where is Kiri?

2884
02:53:53,290 --> 02:53:54,430
Oh dammit.

2885
02:53:54,550 --> 02:53:56,010
My little foot got stuck.

2886
02:53:56,850 --> 02:53:57,950
Oh no, Miss Fortune.

2887
02:54:00,870 --> 02:54:01,410
Oh my God.

2888
02:54:02,110 --> 02:54:03,230
It's a monster.

2889
02:54:03,550 --> 02:54:04,390
Mr. Voice.

2890
02:54:04,690 --> 02:54:05,350
Can you see?

2891
02:54:07,430 --> 02:54:08,730
Oh my God.

2892
02:54:08,870 --> 02:54:09,350
What am I spamming?

2893
02:54:10,910 --> 02:54:11,370
Spam.

2894
02:54:11,490 --> 02:54:11,610
Spam.

2895
02:54:11,810 --> 02:54:12,230
Spam.

2896
02:54:12,230 --> 02:54:12,390
Spam.

2897
02:54:12,390 --> 02:54:12,410
Spam.

2898
02:54:12,510 --> 02:54:12,510
Spam.

2899
02:54:14,530 --> 02:54:19,250
Oh my God, Quicktime event.

2900
02:54:21,290 --> 02:54:22,770
I got a nod off.

2901
02:54:23,870 --> 02:54:25,290
I don't think that was a fox.

2902
02:54:30,650 --> 02:54:31,850
You shut up.

2903
02:54:32,070 --> 02:54:33,250
Stop doubting me.

2904
02:54:37,710 --> 02:54:38,590
What's he recording?

2905
02:54:38,650 --> 02:54:40,470
Oh my god, he's recording the Blair Witch for real.

2906
02:54:42,510 --> 02:54:43,710
He's recording the Blair Witch.

2907
02:54:46,450 --> 02:54:49,330
Let's play dead.

2908
02:54:55,750 --> 02:54:58,670
Let's...let's...or...well actually I want to not listen to the narrator so let's get up.

2909
02:55:00,190 --> 02:55:01,670
Instead of playing dead let's get up.

2910
02:55:02,610 --> 02:55:03,930
Oh he helped me.

2911
02:55:12,970 --> 02:55:13,650
Hey!

2912
02:55:13,910 --> 02:55:14,990
Don't be rude.

2913
02:55:18,910 --> 02:55:20,470
Oh my god.

2914
02:55:20,910 --> 02:55:22,150
He's so stoic.

2915
02:55:24,290 --> 02:55:26,870
He's such a fox of few words.

2916
02:55:28,610 --> 02:55:30,830
He's a fox of so few words everybody.

2917
02:55:32,550 --> 02:55:33,290
No!

2918
02:55:36,370 --> 02:55:40,410
Unless she's just getting some exercise.

2919
02:55:43,130 --> 02:55:43,870
Benjamin.

2920
02:55:44,930 --> 02:55:45,410
Benjamin.

2921
02:55:51,890 --> 02:55:53,590
Keep running after Benjamin.

2922
02:55:55,970 --> 02:55:56,930
Keep going.

2923
02:55:56,950 --> 02:55:57,350
Oh no!

2924
02:55:57,610 --> 02:55:58,070
Oh my god.

2925
02:56:00,550 --> 02:56:01,110
Really?

2926
02:56:01,910 --> 02:56:06,970
You don't remember me saying if you keep running you'll end up hurt.

2927
02:56:06,990 --> 02:56:07,610
You put that there!

2928
02:56:08,030 --> 02:56:10,970
I know I could have been more specific.

2929
02:56:11,270 --> 02:56:11,590
Oh my god.

2930
02:56:11,690 --> 02:56:12,910
There's a bear trap up ahead.

2931
02:56:13,090 --> 02:56:14,570
Stop or you will be hurt.

2932
02:56:14,650 --> 02:56:16,870
But I felt like getting straight to the point.

2933
02:56:17,170 --> 02:56:18,010
Okay, okay.

2934
02:56:18,070 --> 02:56:18,990
Thank you.

2935
02:56:19,410 --> 02:56:21,470
Who left a bear trap here anyway?

2936
02:56:21,510 --> 02:56:23,470
I haven't seen any bears.

2937
02:56:23,690 --> 02:56:29,190
Well, I don't want to point any fingers, but it was obviously the fox.

2938
02:56:30,610 --> 02:56:31,390
Obviously.

2939
02:56:34,590 --> 02:56:35,890
Fox-i-phobia.

2940
02:56:40,890 --> 02:56:41,670
Okay.

2941
02:56:42,310 --> 02:56:42,670
Alright.

2942
02:56:44,010 --> 02:56:44,830
Eternal happiness.

2943
02:56:45,770 --> 02:56:46,050
Right.

2944
02:56:46,250 --> 02:56:46,450
Okay.

2945
02:56:48,410 --> 02:56:49,190
Sparkles!

2946
02:56:50,130 --> 02:56:51,750
It's a happy...

2947
02:56:51,750 --> 02:56:53,870
It's a happy thing now.

2948
02:56:55,570 --> 02:56:56,530
Happy bear trap.

2949
02:56:59,190 --> 02:57:00,030
Yeah!

2950
02:57:21,290 --> 02:57:25,190
She just gave up her...

2951
02:57:26,790 --> 02:57:27,990
Yes, pay attention.

2952
02:57:28,610 --> 02:57:29,830
She just made up this whole lore.

2953
02:57:31,990 --> 02:57:35,550
Wait, when did Bubsy die?

2954
02:57:37,370 --> 02:57:39,070
Is Bubsy now in the bear trap?

2955
02:57:39,170 --> 02:57:39,630
No, okay.

2956
02:57:41,570 --> 02:57:43,470
Let's rip Bubsy I guess.

2957
02:57:44,670 --> 02:57:44,970
Yeah.

2958
02:57:46,790 --> 02:57:48,090
This one looks like a bird.

2959
02:57:50,030 --> 02:57:51,190
Oh, see all runestones.

2960
02:57:58,750 --> 02:57:59,710
What's primeve?

2961
02:58:00,830 --> 02:58:02,970
Because we gotta get rid of the beyond apparently.

2962
02:58:04,890 --> 02:58:06,390
Oh, we can't take it back.

2963
02:58:06,730 --> 02:58:06,990
Okay.

2964
02:58:07,750 --> 02:58:08,370
Well, oh!

2965
02:58:08,690 --> 02:58:09,530
We got a doll even.

2966
02:58:11,570 --> 02:58:12,590
Doll number six.

2967
02:58:17,930 --> 02:58:20,050
Oh, nice.

2968
02:58:20,190 --> 02:58:20,470
Okay.

2969
02:58:20,950 --> 02:58:22,570
I can have my cake and eat it too.

2970
02:58:23,570 --> 02:58:24,250
Nothing.

2971
02:58:24,410 --> 02:58:26,230
She gets so defensive about it.

2972
02:58:27,890 --> 02:58:28,570
Nothing.

2973
02:58:31,090 --> 02:58:33,350
Oh my gosh, again?

2974
02:58:38,730 --> 02:58:40,770
The Aurora Borealis.

2975
02:58:40,850 --> 02:58:41,390
You guys, look!

2976
02:58:44,190 --> 02:58:48,370
Do you believe in love after love?

2977
02:58:48,490 --> 02:58:49,590
I believe in magic, yeah!

2978
02:58:52,570 --> 02:58:52,830
I do.

2979
02:58:53,370 --> 02:58:57,890
When mommy and daddy scream, I go to my secret hiding spot.

2980
02:58:58,350 --> 02:59:00,210
I've never seen those tricks those guys can do.

2981
02:59:00,310 --> 02:59:01,070
It's kind of crazy.

2982
02:59:02,790 --> 02:59:04,110
And it takes her two lives!

2983
02:59:09,690 --> 02:59:11,910
The narrator is so hot and cold with us.

2984
02:59:14,970 --> 02:59:16,470
Oh, let's just lie.

2985
02:59:16,730 --> 02:59:17,270
Let's say yeah.

2986
02:59:17,950 --> 02:59:19,110
So we don't hurt his feelings.

2987
02:59:19,430 --> 02:59:20,930
I mean, you know, we don't, but...

2988
02:59:23,810 --> 02:59:29,570
It's just so that he doesn't, you know, we don't want him to be like...

2989
02:59:30,130 --> 02:59:31,750
Oh, you don't trust me?

2990
02:59:32,050 --> 02:59:32,330
Easy.

2991
02:59:32,750 --> 02:59:32,970
You know?

2992
02:59:36,930 --> 02:59:39,630
Well, you know, I'm already dead.

2993
02:59:41,130 --> 02:59:43,130
But I want a human's perspective.

2994
02:59:43,310 --> 02:59:44,490
Are you guys afraid of dying?

2995
02:59:46,850 --> 02:59:50,570
I mean, you see ghosts before you, so...

2996
02:59:51,550 --> 02:59:51,970
Yeah.

2997
02:59:52,610 --> 02:59:53,450
Spoilers.

2998
02:59:53,910 --> 02:59:55,710
Seeing some no's, seeing some yeahs.

2999
02:59:58,610 --> 03:00:02,470
Depends on the day, but not before GTA 6.

3000
03:00:03,750 --> 03:00:06,910
And we'll say yeah before GTA 6.

3001
03:00:06,910 --> 03:00:09,270
Yes, I am.

3002
03:00:09,510 --> 03:00:11,770
I don't know if I will like being dead.

3003
03:00:12,130 --> 03:00:14,510
It's like too mysterious, you know?

3004
03:00:14,910 --> 03:00:16,590
What if I can't bring my glitter?

3005
03:00:19,770 --> 03:00:20,950
Mint 3.0?

3006
03:00:20,990 --> 03:00:22,030
But that's just tomorrow!

3007
03:00:22,990 --> 03:00:24,190
What about after tomorrow?

3008
03:00:25,410 --> 03:00:26,010
Oh no.

3009
03:00:26,350 --> 03:00:28,290
I hope it doesn't rain that much.

3010
03:00:28,590 --> 03:00:30,450
I don't like my feet getting wet.

3011
03:00:30,650 --> 03:00:32,410
I'm a little lady, you know?

3012
03:00:32,410 --> 03:00:33,030
I'm so chill.

3013
03:00:33,790 --> 03:00:34,710
She's a little lady.

3014
03:00:35,470 --> 03:00:37,230
Is this Benjamin's house?

3015
03:00:51,510 --> 03:00:54,350
Is this really his house?

3016
03:00:55,510 --> 03:00:58,390
Is this really his place?

3017
03:00:59,050 --> 03:00:59,910
Okay, here we go.

3018
03:01:00,730 --> 03:01:02,250
We don't want to get too wet, you know?

3019
03:01:11,610 --> 03:01:14,430
We love a handsy fox, huh?

3020
03:01:28,390 --> 03:01:28,790
Hi!

3021
03:01:33,090 --> 03:01:35,950
He's muscular, yeah, and his paws are soft.

3022
03:01:36,050 --> 03:01:37,470
A win, a win, a win.

3023
03:01:43,090 --> 03:01:44,430
She's so positive.

3024
03:01:52,140 --> 03:01:52,950
In woods.

3025
03:01:54,370 --> 03:01:55,090
What is this?

3026
03:01:59,050 --> 03:02:01,110
Oh yeah, he was recording earlier too.

3027
03:02:01,270 --> 03:02:02,010
He's building...

3028
03:02:07,090 --> 03:02:07,770
Oopsie.

3029
03:02:13,290 --> 03:02:14,430
Let's try later.

3030
03:02:14,850 --> 03:02:15,250
What's this?

3031
03:02:17,250 --> 03:02:18,670
Got some incense going into it.

3032
03:02:21,190 --> 03:02:23,370
Let's read Benjamin's diary.

3033
03:02:25,850 --> 03:02:28,230
We gotta know the Benjamin lore.

3034
03:02:28,750 --> 03:02:31,610
If he took our happiness, we can take his secrets, okay?

3035
03:02:36,990 --> 03:02:37,610
Yulhanelios?

3036
03:02:39,150 --> 03:02:40,590
Oh my god, it's actually Benjamin.

3037
03:02:41,870 --> 03:02:42,890
No way.

3038
03:02:54,270 --> 03:02:54,910
Confidence.

3039
03:02:55,330 --> 03:03:09,370
I travel from Sensirty to Pandora when fog appears.

3040
03:03:12,650 --> 03:03:16,610
Hasn't the kid, the Japanese kid been saying, where's the fog?

3041
03:03:17,690 --> 03:03:20,450
And also, Sensirty is also the place that I mentioned.

3042
03:03:20,450 --> 03:03:24,590
The Sensirty is what gets rid of the beyond.

3043
03:03:25,650 --> 03:03:26,950
I pack things and food.

3044
03:03:27,150 --> 03:03:28,870
No information on how long stay.

3045
03:03:29,750 --> 03:03:31,110
I rent cabin until work done.

3046
03:03:31,770 --> 03:03:32,370
Where's the fog?

3047
03:03:32,750 --> 03:03:33,190
Yeah!

3048
03:03:34,390 --> 03:03:35,830
My task important.

3049
03:03:36,210 --> 03:03:38,210
Boss told me many victims in town.

3050
03:03:39,170 --> 03:03:40,150
I need courage.

3051
03:03:41,410 --> 03:03:46,810
After long walk in fog, I arrived city, called Openfields.

3052
03:03:47,070 --> 03:03:48,510
Tiny town has good forest.

3053
03:03:48,510 --> 03:03:51,210
Cabin very nice, has TV, kitchen.

3054
03:03:51,610 --> 03:03:52,310
I sleep sofa.

3055
03:03:52,690 --> 03:03:53,770
I decorate cabin.

3056
03:03:54,270 --> 03:03:56,050
Fish bells smell funny.

3057
03:03:56,530 --> 03:03:57,890
I ate mushrooms.

3058
03:03:58,050 --> 03:03:59,070
Mushrooms in woods.

3059
03:03:59,550 --> 03:04:00,650
I refresh after sleep.

3060
03:04:01,690 --> 03:04:03,750
Try find parasite.

3061
03:04:04,090 --> 03:04:05,050
Did not find it.

3062
03:04:05,250 --> 03:04:05,970
Day one fail.

3063
03:04:07,790 --> 03:04:10,310
Many victims gone missing in Parasite game.

3064
03:04:12,210 --> 03:04:13,750
Parasite game, huh?

3065
03:04:15,770 --> 03:04:17,030
I can't help.

3066
03:04:17,030 --> 03:04:18,590
Who are the victims?

3067
03:04:19,230 --> 03:04:19,990
What game?

3068
03:04:20,330 --> 03:04:22,490
And is afraid of the Parasite?

3069
03:04:22,850 --> 03:04:23,770
Feel sad.

3070
03:04:24,270 --> 03:04:25,470
I send message to boss.

3071
03:04:26,690 --> 03:04:29,150
Some victims not coming to Sinircity.

3072
03:04:34,420 --> 03:04:36,180
I see Parasite.

3073
03:04:36,500 --> 03:04:37,200
It scared me.

3074
03:04:37,900 --> 03:04:39,120
Also not eat more mushrooms.

3075
03:04:39,540 --> 03:04:40,980
Stomach ache and much gas.

3076
03:04:42,280 --> 03:04:42,800
Oh no!

3077
03:04:43,220 --> 03:04:43,860
Is no good.

3078
03:04:44,280 --> 03:04:45,560
Don't eat this mushroom again.

3079
03:04:47,820 --> 03:04:49,780
Mushrooms serious danger.

3080
03:04:49,900 --> 03:04:50,720
Oh no!

3081
03:04:51,640 --> 03:04:52,460
Not feel good.

3082
03:04:52,700 --> 03:04:53,580
Danger mushroom.

3083
03:04:53,980 --> 03:04:54,820
I stay home.

3084
03:04:55,040 --> 03:04:56,600
Cut wood and do tea and root soup.

3085
03:04:56,920 --> 03:04:57,520
Good taste.

3086
03:04:58,240 --> 03:05:00,360
Oh no!

3087
03:05:01,340 --> 03:05:03,160
I do dolls for victim and pictures.

3088
03:05:03,920 --> 03:05:05,020
If she sees them, good.

3089
03:05:05,880 --> 03:05:07,020
Parasite recognized.

3090
03:05:07,200 --> 03:05:09,920
Morgo code P0101222.

3091
03:05:10,520 --> 03:05:11,500
It likes to play.

3092
03:05:11,980 --> 03:05:13,200
I has guide for steps.

3093
03:05:13,520 --> 03:05:14,180
Purge tomorrow.

3094
03:05:14,180 --> 03:05:16,560
Now rest until stomach good.

3095
03:05:17,940 --> 03:05:19,260
Morgo, Morgo.

3096
03:05:20,840 --> 03:05:23,520
Feeling no stomach aches, only gas.

3097
03:05:25,060 --> 03:05:27,080
Is a gassy fox, you guys.

3098
03:05:28,260 --> 03:05:29,320
Morgo know I'm here.

3099
03:05:29,620 --> 03:05:31,980
Morgo play old trick many times now.

3100
03:05:32,460 --> 03:05:33,800
But it make mistake.

3101
03:05:34,260 --> 03:05:36,520
One victim can hear its voice inside her head.

3102
03:05:37,120 --> 03:05:38,740
Victim code Misfortune.

3103
03:05:39,960 --> 03:05:41,000
Is nice code.

3104
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,160
Morgo can't have her say boss.

3105
03:05:46,840 --> 03:05:47,900
She must be rescued.

3106
03:05:48,200 --> 03:05:49,180
But I follow steps.

3107
03:05:50,740 --> 03:05:52,020
I saw Morgo take shape.

3108
03:05:52,420 --> 03:05:52,940
Scary.

3109
03:05:59,040 --> 03:06:01,180
She doesn't recognize her own name.

3110
03:06:03,080 --> 03:06:03,800
Oh my gosh!

3111
03:06:03,880 --> 03:06:04,520
So cute!

3112
03:06:04,640 --> 03:06:06,320
She looks like Animal Crossing character.

3113
03:06:07,740 --> 03:06:09,080
Boss send me message.

3114
03:06:09,380 --> 03:06:10,380
Watch victim house.

3115
03:06:10,380 --> 03:06:11,340
I sleep outside.

3116
03:06:11,880 --> 03:06:12,140
Hiding.

3117
03:06:12,780 --> 03:06:13,180
Trash.

3118
03:06:13,620 --> 03:06:14,840
I fail find parasite.

3119
03:06:15,420 --> 03:06:16,360
It did not come today.

3120
03:06:16,700 --> 03:06:17,140
Big trouble.

3121
03:06:17,320 --> 03:06:18,180
Misfortune watch me.

3122
03:06:18,420 --> 03:06:18,920
Strange.

3123
03:06:20,240 --> 03:06:20,940
Big trouble?

3124
03:06:21,520 --> 03:06:22,120
Misfortune?

3125
03:06:22,500 --> 03:06:23,480
But that's me.

3126
03:06:23,880 --> 03:06:25,620
I bet he's in love with me.

3127
03:06:25,880 --> 03:06:26,780
Oh my gosh!

3128
03:06:26,860 --> 03:06:28,400
See there's hearts around him.

3129
03:06:28,700 --> 03:06:30,280
There's hearts around him.

3130
03:06:32,160 --> 03:06:33,240
Why she see me?

3131
03:06:33,680 --> 03:06:34,580
She big eyes.

3132
03:06:34,960 --> 03:06:35,660
I run away.

3133
03:06:36,200 --> 03:06:37,220
Felt warm in stomach.

3134
03:06:37,640 --> 03:06:39,140
Maybe mushrooms tickle again.

3135
03:06:42,870 --> 03:06:44,490
Does he actually like her back?

3136
03:06:46,750 --> 03:06:48,330
I see Morgo play old trick again.

3137
03:06:48,570 --> 03:06:50,910
Victim don't realize all is again.

3138
03:06:51,170 --> 03:06:52,010
All is again!

3139
03:06:52,570 --> 03:06:54,430
Must courage and stop parasite this time.

3140
03:06:54,950 --> 03:06:56,470
I send many victims to Sinnersity.

3141
03:06:57,230 --> 03:06:58,310
I got level 2 protector.

3142
03:06:58,730 --> 03:06:59,250
I confident.

3143
03:06:59,790 --> 03:07:01,850
Now I has prime illumination cane.

3144
03:07:02,090 --> 03:07:02,490
Oh sorry.

3145
03:07:02,630 --> 03:07:04,790
Prim-Eve illumination cane.

3146
03:07:12,130 --> 03:07:14,570
I try prim-Eve illumination cane in woods.

3147
03:07:14,870 --> 03:07:15,230
Fun.

3148
03:07:15,510 --> 03:07:16,210
I feel courage.

3149
03:07:16,590 --> 03:07:17,810
Practicing to help Misfortune.

3150
03:07:18,250 --> 03:07:20,070
I see she makes too much talk.

3151
03:07:20,370 --> 03:07:21,850
I think she fun and strong.

3152
03:07:23,110 --> 03:07:24,490
Mint big eyes too.

3153
03:07:24,590 --> 03:07:24,870
Hey!

3154
03:07:26,510 --> 03:07:27,710
Do you like me?

3155
03:07:27,790 --> 03:07:28,450
Oh my gosh.

3156
03:07:29,810 --> 03:07:31,870
Morgo confused by charms of Misfortune.

3157
03:07:32,270 --> 03:07:34,710
I did video picking, wood and parasite game.

3158
03:07:35,090 --> 03:07:36,290
But I'm courage now.

3159
03:07:36,610 --> 03:07:37,570
I scared only little.

3160
03:07:38,450 --> 03:07:40,530
Yes, I know how to talk.

3161
03:07:40,750 --> 03:07:41,470
He loves me.

3162
03:07:42,130 --> 03:07:42,870
He loves me.

3163
03:07:44,330 --> 03:07:45,530
She's a yapper.

3164
03:07:46,350 --> 03:07:47,830
I message boss I'm doing it today.

3165
03:07:48,110 --> 03:07:48,950
All steps followed.

3166
03:07:49,410 --> 03:07:50,430
Prepared breakfast tea.

3167
03:07:51,030 --> 03:07:52,330
Funny feeling with tea.

3168
03:07:52,770 --> 03:07:53,870
Herbs from woods are fun.

3169
03:07:54,430 --> 03:07:55,770
I'm courage and confident today.

3170
03:07:56,130 --> 03:07:56,990
I ready.

3171
03:07:57,750 --> 03:08:00,250
If Bengi has a boss, he has a job.

3172
03:08:00,570 --> 03:08:02,550
Then I can be married to him.

3173
03:08:03,090 --> 03:08:04,250
He has a job.

3174
03:08:08,370 --> 03:08:09,690
Fix the TV.

3175
03:08:10,790 --> 03:08:13,070
Happiness to the video player.

3176
03:08:15,970 --> 03:08:18,850
I hope I haven't missed any.

3177
03:08:18,990 --> 03:08:19,470
Oh gosh.

3178
03:08:19,990 --> 03:08:20,690
I'm nervous.

3179
03:08:21,070 --> 03:08:22,150
What does he play?

3180
03:08:22,770 --> 03:08:25,950
It looks like Benjamin likes to educate himself.

3181
03:08:26,330 --> 03:08:27,450
I like that in a fox.

3182
03:08:27,770 --> 03:08:29,470
Meaning of love.

3183
03:08:30,790 --> 03:08:32,590
The fun stories of a boring man.

3184
03:08:33,350 --> 03:08:35,210
When hatred wants to be loved.

3185
03:08:35,290 --> 03:08:35,930
He loves you.

3186
03:08:36,130 --> 03:08:38,410
He was really lonely I think.

3187
03:08:38,410 --> 03:08:40,930
The upside of being a spirit animal.

3188
03:08:41,570 --> 03:08:42,170
Communication.

3189
03:08:42,870 --> 03:08:43,930
Key to cooperation.

3190
03:08:44,730 --> 03:08:45,890
Learning how to be...

3191
03:08:45,890 --> 03:08:47,550
Oh I thought this was something else.

3192
03:08:47,710 --> 03:08:48,930
Learning how to be great.

3193
03:08:50,590 --> 03:08:52,270
Death after life.

3194
03:08:58,550 --> 03:09:01,130
We got Bengi's playlist.

3195
03:09:01,590 --> 03:09:02,390
Oh this is tea.

3196
03:09:02,850 --> 03:09:03,570
What's the tea?

3197
03:09:04,550 --> 03:09:08,010
That tea smells like roses and lemon.

3198
03:09:08,710 --> 03:09:09,430
Great fox!

3199
03:09:09,430 --> 03:09:11,290
You guys stop it.

3200
03:09:19,770 --> 03:09:21,330
Drink Benjamin's tea?

3201
03:09:22,550 --> 03:09:23,780
Yeah, let's drink it.

3202
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:38,580
Why is everything in this...

3203
03:09:38,580 --> 03:09:40,480
Oh no, is it the mushrooms?

3204
03:09:40,480 --> 03:09:42,620
Why is everything in this game poisonous?

3205
03:09:43,400 --> 03:09:44,120
Oh my god.

3206
03:09:44,840 --> 03:09:46,520
Oh they are on their little date.

3207
03:09:47,040 --> 03:09:48,340
Oh I want PB&J.

3208
03:09:49,060 --> 03:09:49,980
I'll have that for dinner.

3209
03:09:51,520 --> 03:09:53,180
Why is he got flies around him?

3210
03:09:53,380 --> 03:09:54,360
Stinky ass.

3211
03:09:54,760 --> 03:09:55,580
Go take a shower.

3212
03:09:56,560 --> 03:09:56,840
Ew.

3213
03:09:57,240 --> 03:09:58,480
Why are you drooling?

3214
03:10:03,830 --> 03:10:05,750
Is this what love is like?

3215
03:10:06,190 --> 03:10:07,190
It's disgusting.

3216
03:10:07,990 --> 03:10:09,110
It's messy.

3217
03:10:10,490 --> 03:10:11,370
Oh my god.

3218
03:10:13,090 --> 03:10:13,850
Yeah, again.

3219
03:10:14,330 --> 03:10:15,710
Wait, but Benji is here.

3220
03:10:16,550 --> 03:10:17,050
No!

3221
03:10:21,190 --> 03:10:22,110
Benji, no!

3222
03:10:25,750 --> 03:10:27,270
You threw up in his house.

3223
03:10:27,910 --> 03:10:28,590
Oh, peanut butter.

3224
03:10:29,510 --> 03:10:29,890
Yummy.

3225
03:10:32,430 --> 03:10:35,230
That's how Mata talks about herself in her stinky GFU.

3226
03:10:35,410 --> 03:10:35,690
No!

3227
03:10:36,270 --> 03:10:37,990
Mata is the only stinky one.

3228
03:10:39,290 --> 03:10:40,070
Tara Khan.

3229
03:10:40,330 --> 03:10:41,270
Oh, sick hat.

3230
03:10:49,570 --> 03:10:51,230
We got some paint here.

3231
03:10:51,390 --> 03:10:52,330
We got some stinky socks.

3232
03:10:52,630 --> 03:10:53,130
Oh my gosh.

3233
03:10:55,630 --> 03:10:57,430
He's still eating his mushrooms.

3234
03:11:09,250 --> 03:11:11,390
Why does he keep ignoring us?

3235
03:11:18,830 --> 03:11:20,130
What are you...

3236
03:11:20,130 --> 03:11:20,750
What are you doing?

3237
03:11:21,530 --> 03:11:22,950
Is this a kiss?

3238
03:11:23,050 --> 03:11:23,510
Oh my god.

3239
03:11:23,710 --> 03:11:24,550
Is this really happening?

3240
03:11:24,870 --> 03:11:25,550
What the fox?

3241
03:11:26,090 --> 03:11:26,650
What is he doing?

3242
03:11:27,170 --> 03:11:27,610
What is that?

3243
03:11:27,630 --> 03:11:28,350
Your diary.

3244
03:11:28,910 --> 03:11:32,690
I'm sorry if you're upset because I read it, but I was curious.

3245
03:11:34,370 --> 03:11:37,290
Is it the monster in your diary you're afraid of?

3246
03:11:37,550 --> 03:11:38,570
I think I saw him too.

3247
03:11:38,570 --> 03:11:39,650
Look at his little paws.

3248
03:11:39,830 --> 03:11:40,550
So cute!

3249
03:11:42,290 --> 03:11:43,210
So cute.

3250
03:11:44,310 --> 03:11:44,850
Oh my gosh.

3251
03:11:44,850 --> 03:11:47,750
You can't hide the children.

3252
03:11:50,990 --> 03:11:52,390
Let's follow Benjamin.

3253
03:11:54,030 --> 03:11:56,250
Are you rescuing me Benjamin?

3254
03:11:56,710 --> 03:11:58,530
Like if I was a girl in trouble?

3255
03:11:58,670 --> 03:12:00,450
Oh my gosh, we are a damsel in distress.

3256
03:12:00,690 --> 03:12:03,850
We are a lady in...

3257
03:12:04,410 --> 03:12:06,530
What's a bad thing that starts with L?

3258
03:12:08,410 --> 03:12:10,850
A lady in...

3259
03:12:15,480 --> 03:12:16,300
Oh!

3260
03:12:19,220 --> 03:12:19,820
Lost?

3261
03:12:20,100 --> 03:12:20,560
No!

3262
03:12:22,760 --> 03:12:23,360
Liability.

3263
03:12:23,660 --> 03:12:25,640
Yeah, we are a lady in liability.

3264
03:12:26,580 --> 03:12:27,240
In lament.

3265
03:12:30,900 --> 03:12:34,100
Oh my gosh, he got a haircut.

3266
03:12:38,260 --> 03:12:39,960
Are you gonna take it?

3267
03:12:40,680 --> 03:12:43,220
Oh no, is this Benjamin?

3268
03:12:44,100 --> 03:12:44,600
Benjamin.

3269
03:12:47,160 --> 03:12:48,560
Sparkle to the hair.

3270
03:12:50,340 --> 03:12:51,540
There's a secret passage.

3271
03:12:52,860 --> 03:12:54,800
There's a hole behind the painting.

3272
03:12:55,060 --> 03:12:55,580
Hello.

3273
03:12:56,900 --> 03:12:57,420
Hello.

3274
03:12:58,380 --> 03:12:59,700
I love the way she says hello.

3275
03:12:59,820 --> 03:13:00,320
It's so funny.

3276
03:13:00,620 --> 03:13:01,460
Oh, there's a chair here.

3277
03:13:03,560 --> 03:13:05,540
Such a clever little lady.

3278
03:13:06,220 --> 03:13:06,820
Oh, never mind.

3279
03:13:06,880 --> 03:13:07,540
We need the chair.

3280
03:13:10,840 --> 03:13:11,480
Nice.

3281
03:13:12,200 --> 03:13:15,220
Hold on, is there anything else besides weapons and such?

3282
03:13:15,840 --> 03:13:17,720
We made our choice guys.

3283
03:13:17,780 --> 03:13:18,920
We can't go back upstairs.

3284
03:13:19,760 --> 03:13:21,680
Time to use my ninja skills.

3285
03:13:22,640 --> 03:13:22,900
Yes!

3286
03:13:27,180 --> 03:13:29,000
What a bad crack.

3287
03:13:30,540 --> 03:13:31,280
Be quiet.

3288
03:13:32,500 --> 03:13:34,200
This is a ninja mission.

3289
03:13:36,700 --> 03:13:38,780
Benjamin, are you here?

3290
03:13:38,780 --> 03:13:40,820
Why did it keep happening?

3291
03:13:41,600 --> 03:13:42,720
Oh my gosh, was it the tea?

3292
03:13:43,600 --> 03:13:44,940
No, the tea!

3293
03:13:46,540 --> 03:13:51,540
So it was Benjamin placing these, but Benjamin seems so nice.

3294
03:13:51,740 --> 03:13:54,020
Maybe he put them for that monster.

3295
03:13:54,440 --> 03:13:55,320
No, probably, right?

3296
03:13:55,560 --> 03:13:56,200
Not for us.

3297
03:13:56,340 --> 03:13:57,120
Oh, there's food.

3298
03:14:00,260 --> 03:14:01,780
Can of fish balls?

3299
03:14:02,100 --> 03:14:03,660
This is like sushi balls.

3300
03:14:04,720 --> 03:14:06,020
Not quite, I think.

3301
03:14:06,640 --> 03:14:07,860
I'm getting hungry though.

3302
03:14:09,500 --> 03:14:11,180
Not because of the fish balls.

3303
03:14:12,720 --> 03:14:14,020
Let's take this key.

3304
03:14:14,400 --> 03:14:15,060
Looks important.

3305
03:14:15,960 --> 03:14:17,020
A picture of a key.

3306
03:14:17,640 --> 03:14:18,260
Interesting.

3307
03:14:18,600 --> 03:14:19,380
Or it's just a picture?

3308
03:14:21,180 --> 03:14:21,800
Wait...

3309
03:14:21,800 --> 03:14:22,760
Can we not grab it?

3310
03:14:22,760 --> 03:14:26,580
My ninja senses are telling me to climb up on this chair.

3311
03:14:29,200 --> 03:14:30,780
Don't watch the fire!

3312
03:14:30,900 --> 03:14:31,680
Watch the fire!

3313
03:14:31,860 --> 03:14:32,420
Oh my gosh.

3314
03:14:33,080 --> 03:14:37,180
A real ninja lady always touches everything.

3315
03:14:37,180 --> 03:14:40,040
A secret button.

3316
03:14:40,580 --> 03:14:41,860
Secret button, oh yeah.

3317
03:14:42,100 --> 03:14:43,540
Press the button baby!

3318
03:14:44,940 --> 03:14:47,200
Alright then, I push the button.

3319
03:14:51,980 --> 03:14:54,280
See guys, we had to do it anyway.

3320
03:14:56,120 --> 03:14:57,940
Ninja lady touches everything!

3321
03:15:05,970 --> 03:15:07,810
That was easy.

3322
03:15:08,630 --> 03:15:09,270
Too easy.

3323
03:15:09,470 --> 03:15:11,310
We're too good at this game.

3324
03:15:26,070 --> 03:15:28,290
Oh my god, microwave oven.

3325
03:15:38,540 --> 03:15:40,410
You've been knocked down before.

3326
03:15:40,570 --> 03:15:43,470
Yeah, you can do this Miss Fortune!

3327
03:15:43,510 --> 03:15:44,850
Did you let that stop you?

3328
03:15:45,490 --> 03:15:47,030
Yeah, keep getting up!

3329
03:15:47,630 --> 03:15:48,850
Get up Miss Fortune.

3330
03:15:49,330 --> 03:15:50,510
You can do it.

3331
03:15:50,550 --> 03:15:52,490
Yeah, she's just pep-talking herself.

3332
03:15:53,610 --> 03:15:54,230
Because...

3333
03:15:54,230 --> 03:15:55,750
Because you are...

3334
03:15:55,750 --> 03:15:56,990
Miss Fortune!

3335
03:15:58,110 --> 03:15:58,730
Because...

3336
03:16:00,030 --> 03:16:00,650
Because...

3337
03:16:00,650 --> 03:16:02,130
You're a strong little lady!

3338
03:16:02,630 --> 03:16:05,130
You are the little lady Miss Fortune!

3339
03:16:09,370 --> 03:16:11,570
I love that part, so sweet.

3340
03:16:18,530 --> 03:16:21,090
Maybe we shouldn't talk to Mr. Voice anymore.

3341
03:16:21,610 --> 03:16:22,930
Why did Benji leave us anyway?

3342
03:16:23,750 --> 03:16:24,610
We can pet the deer.

3343
03:16:30,210 --> 03:16:32,330
We can finally pet it!

3344
03:16:37,810 --> 03:16:38,870
Oh my gosh!

3345
03:16:38,910 --> 03:16:39,810
I'm so happy!

3346
03:16:40,930 --> 03:16:42,290
Glitter to the baby deer!

3347
03:16:43,730 --> 03:16:46,330
I once tried that and it almost kicked me in the face.

3348
03:16:47,570 --> 03:16:49,850
I probably would have died a second time.

3349
03:16:55,210 --> 03:16:59,690
I'm gonna eat some snacks.

3350
03:16:59,790 --> 03:17:00,550
I hope it's ok guys.

3351
03:17:08,050 --> 03:17:08,830
Bye!

3352
03:17:15,790 --> 03:17:16,960
Very sucky.

3353
03:17:18,510 --> 03:17:19,750
What's snack time?

3354
03:17:19,790 --> 03:17:21,790
Just some calorie made out of my desk.

3355
03:17:30,030 --> 03:17:32,230
She actually figured it out.

3356
03:17:32,230 --> 03:17:34,490
Stop this nonsense.

3357
03:17:34,850 --> 03:17:36,830
We have to keep playing my game.

3358
03:17:37,030 --> 03:17:38,330
You can't make me.

3359
03:17:38,590 --> 03:17:39,390
Yes, I can.

3360
03:17:41,850 --> 03:17:42,890
Stop that.

3361
03:17:43,230 --> 03:17:44,390
Then play with me.

3362
03:17:44,510 --> 03:17:46,890
You need to find your eternal happiness.

3363
03:17:47,330 --> 03:17:48,190
I'll give you a clue.

3364
03:17:48,470 --> 03:17:50,410
It's at home, waiting for you.

3365
03:17:50,630 --> 03:17:52,590
I'm sick of that eternal happiness.

3366
03:17:52,930 --> 03:17:54,130
I don't want it anymore.

3367
03:17:54,450 --> 03:17:55,530
You can't say that.

3368
03:17:55,810 --> 03:17:57,410
That would break the rules.

3369
03:17:57,830 --> 03:17:58,730
You heard me.

3370
03:17:58,890 --> 03:18:01,370
I don't want the eternal happiness anymore.

3371
03:18:01,370 --> 03:18:01,870
Tell him.

3372
03:18:01,870 --> 03:18:04,110
I won't tolerate this behavior.

3373
03:18:04,470 --> 03:18:06,950
I'll be waiting for you at home.

3374
03:18:07,430 --> 03:18:09,430
Now, tell me where Benjamin is.

3375
03:18:09,610 --> 03:18:10,750
What do you do to him?

3376
03:18:13,650 --> 03:18:14,890
Freaking monster.

3377
03:18:17,510 --> 03:18:18,790
Freaking monster.

3378
03:18:20,250 --> 03:18:21,410
Let's pet the deer for good luck.

3379
03:18:31,100 --> 03:18:32,460
Take Benjamin's stuff.

3380
03:18:32,460 --> 03:18:33,660
Let's see what's inside.

3381
03:18:33,980 --> 03:18:36,200
Maybe a clue where to find Benjamin.

3382
03:18:38,480 --> 03:18:39,920
Oh, we got another doll.

3383
03:18:40,940 --> 03:18:41,840
Doll number 7.

3384
03:18:42,200 --> 03:18:47,980
At the end of the road, you will realize you already signed the deal.

3385
03:18:47,980 --> 03:18:48,400
No!

3386
03:18:49,660 --> 03:18:50,060
No!

3387
03:18:50,860 --> 03:18:52,360
We already signed the deal!

3388
03:18:53,560 --> 03:18:54,780
Oh my god, stop.

3389
03:18:54,900 --> 03:18:55,460
Baby Benjamin.

3390
03:18:58,880 --> 03:19:00,900
The game was rigged from the start.

3391
03:19:04,820 --> 03:19:07,060
This is really mysterious.

3392
03:19:08,600 --> 03:19:09,800
Ok, ok, this is a lot.

3393
03:19:09,800 --> 03:19:13,580
For students of the University of Senescedist Technology.

3394
03:19:14,080 --> 03:19:15,840
Protector course 3-step guide.

3395
03:19:16,240 --> 03:19:19,540
3-step guide to exterminate parasitic things from the beyond.

3396
03:19:20,120 --> 03:19:20,780
Introduction.

3397
03:19:21,340 --> 03:19:29,700
As the ultra-reality forms in hand with the concept of time, new realms outside the constituted free 5 realms of essential existence have appeared.

3398
03:19:30,740 --> 03:19:32,060
After the ultra-war.

3399
03:19:32,260 --> 03:19:36,080
This is some crazy lore.

3400
03:19:36,900 --> 03:19:38,600
What's the ultra-war?

3401
03:19:40,400 --> 03:19:43,820
Thousands of beings were discovered as byproducts of the war.

3402
03:19:44,200 --> 03:19:46,900
They created for themselves a new realm.

3403
03:19:47,180 --> 03:19:48,860
We refer to it as the beyond.

3404
03:19:50,620 --> 03:19:55,700
The beyond is, in simple terms, a place of extreme absurdity with no logical laws of physics.

3405
03:19:56,460 --> 03:19:58,040
Erin, thanks for 3 months.

3406
03:19:58,100 --> 03:19:58,620
Thank you.

3407
03:20:00,360 --> 03:20:10,740
We can't allow such beings inside the free at the moment, since the foundation of our reality is based in the energetic and ethical values of the ultra-reality before the ultra-war.

3408
03:20:11,140 --> 03:20:13,200
The beyond is still a misunderstood realm.

3409
03:20:14,500 --> 03:20:17,660
We haven't yet found the pieces to connect with it in a logical manner.

3410
03:20:17,660 --> 03:20:24,840
The few patterns we recognize are the behaviors of some visitors, also known as parasites.

3411
03:20:25,400 --> 03:20:30,980
They normally enter the third reality, aka Pandora, and seek fresh meat to lure into the beyond.

3412
03:20:31,940 --> 03:20:33,480
And that's why we need the protectors.

3413
03:20:33,960 --> 03:20:41,300
The protectors are the only ones with the capability of seeing the imbalance between realities and using the tools available inside the ultra-reality.

3414
03:20:41,680 --> 03:20:45,600
Protectors will help victims and guide them into senescity.

3415
03:20:45,600 --> 03:20:50,620
The guidance provided in this book must be followed with great responsibility.

3416
03:20:51,260 --> 03:20:52,160
Never skip a step.

3417
03:20:52,440 --> 03:20:58,640
For each victim the protector returns to senescity, the protector will be rewarded with new levels, tools, and more steps to follow.

3418
03:21:00,660 --> 03:21:03,140
The Parasite Step 1.

3419
03:21:03,260 --> 03:21:06,440
The protector must locate the victims and the parasite.

3420
03:21:06,940 --> 03:21:15,400
Protector's Parasite Case P0101222 Morgul Evaluate if the victim is in need of assistance.

3421
03:21:15,540 --> 03:21:16,840
If so, then proceed to Step 2.

3422
03:21:18,640 --> 03:21:22,840
Need of Assistance Checklist The victim has forgotten his or her identity.

3423
03:21:23,660 --> 03:21:25,840
The victim is already dead but doesn't realize it.

3424
03:21:26,300 --> 03:21:28,900
The victim believes the illusions of the beyond are real.

3425
03:21:29,480 --> 03:21:31,500
The victim sympathizes with the parasite.

3426
03:21:32,860 --> 03:21:34,000
Checklist of Parasite

3427
03:21:37,080 --> 03:21:40,160
P0101222 Morgul Looking cute today, Mint.

3428
03:21:40,340 --> 03:21:41,460
Oh my gosh, thank you.

3429
03:21:41,840 --> 03:21:43,180
I'll look even cuter tomorrow.

3430
03:21:44,820 --> 03:21:46,800
Thank you for 6 months, Dione.

3431
03:21:48,440 --> 03:21:48,660
1.

3432
03:21:48,760 --> 03:21:50,100
Deforms reality into absurdity.

3433
03:21:51,060 --> 03:21:51,280
2.

3434
03:21:51,420 --> 03:21:55,380
Parasite seems friendly yet it lures the victim to play dangerous games.

3435
03:21:56,040 --> 03:21:56,360
3.

3436
03:21:56,600 --> 03:21:59,060
Its shape shifts into a human-animal creature.

3437
03:22:00,440 --> 03:22:00,920
4.

3438
03:22:01,000 --> 03:22:02,580
It quickly learns about the environment.

3439
03:22:02,840 --> 03:22:05,100
Language and culture are not an issue for this parasite.

3440
03:22:05,100 --> 03:22:06,060
5.

3441
03:22:06,200 --> 03:22:09,920
Large flocks of black birds will appear near the parasite.

3442
03:22:10,220 --> 03:22:14,580
These birds are the eyes of Morgul, giving him an overview of his playing ground.

3443
03:22:16,500 --> 03:22:17,380
Step 2.

3444
03:22:17,700 --> 03:22:18,720
Oh my gosh, this is a lot.

3445
03:22:19,760 --> 03:22:22,660
Use the surroundings to help the victim become aware of the parasite.

3446
03:22:24,220 --> 03:22:29,700
The protector can, for example, write and paint simple messages in public spaces to increase awareness.

3447
03:22:30,180 --> 03:22:32,700
It is strictly forbidden to interact directly with the victim.

3448
03:22:32,700 --> 03:22:34,880
Oh, that's why he doesn't talk to us.

3449
03:22:35,580 --> 03:22:38,620
It could lead to irreversible trauma inside the victim's mind.

3450
03:22:39,100 --> 03:22:43,260
If the parasite kills the victim, you will need to proceed to Step 3 immediately.

3451
03:22:45,940 --> 03:22:46,820
Step 3.

3452
03:22:47,260 --> 03:22:49,300
Prepare for direct contact with...

3453
03:22:49,300 --> 03:22:50,000
With the what?

3454
03:22:50,300 --> 03:22:51,740
Now I will never know.

3455
03:22:51,880 --> 03:22:52,260
Oh no.

3456
03:22:53,360 --> 03:22:54,400
We'll never know.

3457
03:22:58,960 --> 03:22:59,520
Let's...

3458
03:22:59,520 --> 03:23:01,180
Happiness to the broken bag!

3459
03:23:02,700 --> 03:23:02,980
Okay.

3460
03:23:05,420 --> 03:23:07,440
I sure hope I didn't miss any.

3461
03:23:08,300 --> 03:23:09,480
I guess we'll see.

3462
03:23:10,380 --> 03:23:12,240
What are we having direct contact with?

3463
03:23:12,260 --> 03:23:12,820
Oh my gosh.

3464
03:23:14,420 --> 03:23:15,680
That was some crazy lore, right?

3465
03:23:17,260 --> 03:23:19,380
He's earned his degree, this fox.

3466
03:23:24,320 --> 03:23:25,240
That's where he was.

3467
03:23:29,480 --> 03:23:29,920
Okay.

3468
03:23:35,130 --> 03:23:35,510
Oh wait.

3469
03:23:36,450 --> 03:23:37,150
Wait, can I go back in?

3470
03:23:38,030 --> 03:23:38,950
Oh, no.

3471
03:23:39,950 --> 03:23:40,570
I guess...

3472
03:23:40,570 --> 03:23:43,070
Hopefully there was nothing else.

3473
03:23:44,470 --> 03:23:49,050
Now when I look at this, I can see what Benjamin tried to warn me about.

3474
03:23:49,450 --> 03:23:52,650
He knew all along, such a foxy boy.

3475
03:23:52,990 --> 03:23:53,970
Foxy boy.

3476
03:23:56,090 --> 03:23:57,410
She's so cute.

3477
03:23:59,090 --> 03:24:01,490
He was trying to warn us, you guys.

3478
03:24:02,030 --> 03:24:02,390
What?

3479
03:24:04,130 --> 03:24:06,150
He was just trying to warn us.

3480
03:24:06,150 --> 03:24:09,650
Scary, there's no one here.

3481
03:24:22,910 --> 03:24:23,790
She's so funny.

3482
03:24:36,150 --> 03:24:36,390
Mhm.

3483
03:24:39,470 --> 03:24:44,210
I wonder where that wolf is.

3484
03:24:51,130 --> 03:24:51,830
Gasp.

3485
03:24:52,490 --> 03:24:55,790
Uh -huh, Miss Fortune.

3486
03:24:57,610 --> 03:24:59,450
Thanks, Miss Fortune.

3487
03:24:59,450 --> 03:24:59,650
Miss Fortune.

3488
03:25:04,970 --> 03:25:06,290
Thanks, other Miss Fortune.

3489
03:25:09,250 --> 03:25:10,210
I do that too.

3490
03:25:11,770 --> 03:25:13,250
Crazy how different the game can be.

3491
03:25:13,770 --> 03:25:14,250
Potato.

3492
03:25:17,130 --> 03:25:18,370
Why does he keep showing up?

3493
03:25:22,230 --> 03:25:22,710
Chungkingosaurus.

3494
03:25:25,830 --> 03:25:27,450
Oh, he's got a little heart.

3495
03:25:27,450 --> 03:25:29,550
Oh my god, how fast can I color this?

3496
03:25:31,050 --> 03:25:32,230
Oh my god, speedrun.

3497
03:25:32,330 --> 03:25:33,110
Speedrun the paintings.

3498
03:25:33,750 --> 03:25:34,910
Speedrun the coloring book.

3499
03:25:36,050 --> 03:25:36,530
Done.

3500
03:25:36,690 --> 03:25:36,950
Next.

3501
03:25:40,670 --> 03:25:41,950
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

3502
03:25:42,570 --> 03:25:43,430
Speedrun, speedrun.

3503
03:25:43,590 --> 03:25:43,970
Done.

3504
03:25:44,110 --> 03:25:44,370
Next.

3505
03:25:45,090 --> 03:25:46,930
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

3506
03:25:47,330 --> 03:25:48,110
He's got a little butterfly.

3507
03:25:49,270 --> 03:25:49,750
Sprilophosaurus.

3508
03:25:53,090 --> 03:25:56,450
I got an achievement for painting all the paintings.

3509
03:25:57,450 --> 03:25:58,530
I gamed.

3510
03:26:04,030 --> 03:26:09,950
Why does he gotta wear this alien mask?

3511
03:26:17,130 --> 03:26:18,530
Konbanwa.

3512
03:26:21,810 --> 03:26:22,510
Konichiwa.

3513
03:26:23,510 --> 03:26:26,750
Today is the first time.

3514
03:26:29,630 --> 03:26:32,510
Wait, what does it say?

3515
03:26:32,510 --> 03:26:35,490
Beware of the consequences?

3516
03:26:36,830 --> 03:26:37,430
Hero!

3517
03:26:37,690 --> 03:26:38,510
Oh my god.

3518
03:26:39,210 --> 03:26:41,710
Help Hero!

3519
03:26:42,250 --> 03:26:43,230
Help Hero!

3520
03:26:56,800 --> 03:26:59,200
We couldn't save him.

3521
03:27:00,620 --> 03:27:02,800
We couldn't save him.

3522
03:27:02,840 --> 03:27:03,320
Hero!

3523
03:27:23,990 --> 03:27:24,950
It's ok.

3524
03:27:25,350 --> 03:27:27,450
You have us with you.

3525
03:27:30,570 --> 03:27:32,170
So true.

3526
03:27:33,210 --> 03:27:34,830
Very long sigh.

3527
03:27:36,210 --> 03:27:37,990
Are you gonna kick this all the way?

3528
03:27:39,610 --> 03:27:40,850
Are you gonna kick it again?

3529
03:27:42,390 --> 03:27:44,150
Happiness to the glitter.

3530
03:27:50,090 --> 03:27:54,670
Look at all those birds in the background.

3531
03:27:57,830 --> 03:27:59,410
Look at all the birds in the background.

3532
03:27:59,570 --> 03:28:00,110
Oh my god.

3533
03:28:01,770 --> 03:28:02,850
Ok, keep going.

3534
03:28:07,310 --> 03:28:08,050
Yeah, that was awesome.

3535
03:28:10,410 --> 03:28:11,850
Toki just promote my 3.0?

3536
03:28:16,710 --> 03:28:17,110
Glitter!

3537
03:28:18,710 --> 03:28:19,910
Let's keep kicking the glitter.

3538
03:28:20,990 --> 03:28:21,890
Oh wait, other way.

3539
03:28:22,030 --> 03:28:22,330
Other way.

3540
03:28:23,390 --> 03:28:23,850
Keep kicking.

3541
03:28:23,970 --> 03:28:24,150
No.

3542
03:28:25,570 --> 03:28:27,570
Oh, kick the can three times.

3543
03:28:27,670 --> 03:28:27,870
Wow.

3544
03:28:29,290 --> 03:28:32,970
Wait, how many times do I kick it before I get another achievement?

3545
03:28:33,530 --> 03:28:34,850
What if I kick it ten times?

3546
03:28:41,170 --> 03:28:41,730
Oi.

3547
03:28:50,990 --> 03:28:52,810
Golden can at a hundred kicks.

3548
03:29:00,730 --> 03:29:01,850
Who wants...ok.

3549
03:29:02,490 --> 03:29:03,370
Lucky can.

3550
03:29:03,490 --> 03:29:04,350
This could be you.

3551
03:29:04,970 --> 03:29:06,170
Ok, I just kicked you.

3552
03:29:06,910 --> 03:29:08,070
Who wants the next kick?

3553
03:29:09,770 --> 03:29:11,170
Who wants the next kick?

3554
03:29:11,770 --> 03:29:12,730
That one's you.

3555
03:29:13,250 --> 03:29:14,390
Who wants the next kick?

3556
03:29:14,470 --> 03:29:15,110
This one's you.

3557
03:29:18,410 --> 03:29:22,330
Ok, I think I've maybe gotten as many as I can get.

3558
03:29:22,650 --> 03:29:23,790
Oh, look at all these teenagers.

3559
03:29:24,590 --> 03:29:25,910
Excuse me.

3560
03:29:26,630 --> 03:29:28,490
I'm talking over here.

3561
03:29:29,530 --> 03:29:34,550
Well, if that's how you treat little ladies, then give yourself a fuck.

3562
03:29:37,590 --> 03:29:39,850
Yeah, don't ignore me.

3563
03:29:42,750 --> 03:29:44,530
Ah, glitter in your eyes.

3564
03:29:45,190 --> 03:29:46,650
Why they gotta ignore us?

3565
03:29:46,710 --> 03:29:47,630
Yeah, you tell them.

3566
03:29:47,990 --> 03:29:49,750
You tell them, misfortune.

3567
03:29:55,830 --> 03:29:58,870
Oh gosh, look at all the birds, you guys.

3568
03:30:02,310 --> 03:30:03,510
Oh my god.

3569
03:30:04,310 --> 03:30:05,010
Oh, hello?

3570
03:30:05,870 --> 03:30:06,910
Is my house haunted?

3571
03:30:08,670 --> 03:30:10,590
Oh gosh, my house is evil.

3572
03:30:16,750 --> 03:30:18,190
Yeah, nice.

3573
03:30:19,610 --> 03:30:20,370
Oh my god.

3574
03:30:21,630 --> 03:30:22,710
What's that sound?

3575
03:30:25,670 --> 03:30:26,910
Taro didn't make it.

3576
03:30:27,310 --> 03:30:29,890
Now he's going to get isekai'd to the Disney universe.

3577
03:30:30,770 --> 03:30:33,130
Oh wait, he's going to be a kid genius.

3578
03:30:35,970 --> 03:30:37,110
Might be better though.

3579
03:30:38,570 --> 03:30:39,330
What is that sound?

3580
03:30:40,350 --> 03:30:41,130
What is that sound?

3581
03:30:44,310 --> 03:30:44,830
Hello?

3582
03:30:44,830 --> 03:30:48,670
Smells like something dragging.

3583
03:30:49,230 --> 03:30:50,590
So scary.

3584
03:30:52,210 --> 03:30:54,410
Why is my house like this?

3585
03:30:59,690 --> 03:31:00,350
Benji?

3586
03:31:16,710 --> 03:31:17,830
Hey, I played your game.

3587
03:31:27,350 --> 03:31:28,790
That's not your responsibility.

3588
03:31:29,350 --> 03:31:31,030
Don't put that on a little girl.

3589
03:31:31,550 --> 03:31:35,390
We are doing another game?

3590
03:31:35,450 --> 03:31:36,230
Oh my god.

3591
03:31:37,070 --> 03:31:40,030
Gary doesn't love you.

3592
03:31:40,130 --> 03:31:40,770
I don't commit.

3593
03:31:41,550 --> 03:31:42,370
Oh, oh.

3594
03:31:44,190 --> 03:31:45,030
What's that?

3595
03:31:46,630 --> 03:31:47,870
What's the new game?

3596
03:31:50,390 --> 03:31:52,330
We are starting the new game all over again.

3597
03:31:53,990 --> 03:31:56,150
I'm taking the unicorn this time.

3598
03:32:01,130 --> 03:32:02,290
Yes, Sparkle!

3599
03:32:12,390 --> 03:32:13,550
Oh ho ho.

3600
03:32:15,510 --> 03:32:16,050
Oh yeah.

3601
03:32:18,550 --> 03:32:20,270
No, she's a yapper.

3602
03:32:21,070 --> 03:32:22,850
This person would be a great VTuber.

3603
03:32:29,610 --> 03:32:30,930
You liar.

3604
03:32:35,810 --> 03:32:37,570
No deal.

3605
03:32:37,910 --> 03:32:38,930
No deal.

3606
03:32:41,290 --> 03:32:42,170
No deal.

3607
03:32:42,670 --> 03:32:42,950
No.

3608
03:32:49,050 --> 03:32:49,710
Benji?

3609
03:32:56,050 --> 03:32:56,710
No!

3610
03:32:57,070 --> 03:32:57,770
He doesn't...

3611
03:32:59,630 --> 03:33:01,130
He doesn't know anything!

3612
03:33:02,290 --> 03:33:03,010
Can we go in here?

3613
03:33:03,010 --> 03:33:04,030
Wait, we can...

3614
03:33:08,050 --> 03:33:09,750
Yeah, I do that.

3615
03:33:09,890 --> 03:33:10,630
What about Benjamin?

3616
03:33:11,510 --> 03:33:12,370
Can we dance?

3617
03:33:13,090 --> 03:33:13,710
Oh my god.

3618
03:33:34,230 --> 03:33:35,270
Wait, what did it say?

3619
03:33:36,310 --> 03:33:37,170
You're stuck forever?

3620
03:33:40,810 --> 03:33:41,890
Oh, that's...

3621
03:33:41,890 --> 03:33:44,330
Monster's music forever.

3622
03:33:45,930 --> 03:33:47,210
She's not dancing!

3623
03:33:47,430 --> 03:33:48,710
She's not dancing!

3624
03:33:49,590 --> 03:33:50,310
OK.

3625
03:33:51,510 --> 03:33:52,670
What's in here?

3626
03:33:57,650 --> 03:33:59,270
Abstute observation.

3627
03:34:00,030 --> 03:34:00,930
Can we take the rock?

3628
03:34:02,370 --> 03:34:02,630
No.

3629
03:34:02,850 --> 03:34:03,130
OK.

3630
03:34:05,570 --> 03:34:06,710
Misfortune is so smart.

3631
03:34:06,710 --> 03:34:10,730
OK, I'm just gonna play his game one last time.

3632
03:34:10,870 --> 03:34:11,130
No!

3633
03:34:15,050 --> 03:34:16,390
Don't run there.

3634
03:34:17,790 --> 03:34:19,030
Double click to run!

3635
03:34:26,710 --> 03:34:27,530
Stop it!

3636
03:34:27,810 --> 03:34:28,430
Oh my god.

3637
03:34:29,130 --> 03:34:30,670
Oh no, not again.

3638
03:34:30,930 --> 03:34:33,210
You promised he wouldn't be like last time.

3639
03:34:33,550 --> 03:34:37,810
That was a beautiful example of cause and effect.

3640
03:34:38,250 --> 03:34:39,410
No, you lied to me.

3641
03:34:39,590 --> 03:34:41,410
I don't want to play this game anymore.

3642
03:34:41,410 --> 03:34:45,630
Fine, let me come up with a new game to play.

3643
03:34:48,050 --> 03:34:49,010
New game.

3644
03:34:49,730 --> 03:34:50,470
Knock, knock.

3645
03:34:50,710 --> 03:34:51,650
Who's there?

3646
03:34:51,870 --> 03:34:54,190
No, I don't want to play with you anymore.

3647
03:34:54,690 --> 03:34:56,370
Yeah, she's literally that meme.

3648
03:34:56,590 --> 03:34:57,310
Knock, knock.

3649
03:34:57,510 --> 03:34:58,590
Who's there?

3650
03:34:59,090 --> 03:35:00,290
Oh my god, the voice.

3651
03:35:00,510 --> 03:35:01,950
Oh god, you're scaring me.

3652
03:35:02,070 --> 03:35:02,770
Stop it.

3653
03:35:03,050 --> 03:35:03,870
Leave me alone.

3654
03:35:05,850 --> 03:35:06,770
Oh my god.

3655
03:35:07,950 --> 03:35:08,770
Oh my god.

3656
03:35:12,670 --> 03:35:13,890
Can I answer the door?

3657
03:35:19,470 --> 03:35:21,030
Oh my god.

3658
03:35:21,270 --> 03:35:22,410
Go, go, go!

3659
03:35:23,930 --> 03:35:25,210
Oh, it just repeats guys.

3660
03:35:25,310 --> 03:35:25,470
OK.

3661
03:35:26,610 --> 03:35:27,650
We can go hide.

3662
03:35:31,550 --> 03:35:32,550
Yeah, of course.

3663
03:35:34,650 --> 03:35:35,310
Oh my god, run.

3664
03:35:35,550 --> 03:35:35,870
Run!

3665
03:35:37,190 --> 03:35:37,910
Oh my god.

3666
03:35:43,910 --> 03:35:45,510
Oh my god, you're stupid.

3667
03:35:46,410 --> 03:35:48,030
You're a stupid ghost.

3668
03:35:48,030 --> 03:35:49,830
You don't even know how to open doors.

3669
03:35:54,650 --> 03:35:55,330
Stoney!

3670
03:35:56,450 --> 03:35:57,930
Throw it at his face!

3671
03:35:58,530 --> 03:35:59,210
Roar!

3672
03:35:59,850 --> 03:36:00,210
Oh my god.

3673
03:36:00,550 --> 03:36:01,710
Roar XD

3674
03:36:05,610 --> 03:36:06,290
Stoney!

3675
03:36:23,410 --> 03:36:24,210
Oh my god.

3676
03:36:28,530 --> 03:36:30,470
Oh my god.

3677
03:36:30,590 --> 03:36:31,310
Toxic relationship.

3678
03:36:31,770 --> 03:36:32,590
Stop being so jealous.

3679
03:36:41,470 --> 03:36:43,030
Yeah, get out of my house.

3680
03:36:43,650 --> 03:36:44,110
Get out.

3681
03:36:59,150 --> 03:36:59,870
Scary.

3682
03:37:00,730 --> 03:37:01,830
Oh my god.

3683
03:37:03,490 --> 03:37:05,070
Oh my god!

3684
03:37:09,430 --> 03:37:11,410
He's kind of awesome though.

3685
03:37:15,410 --> 03:37:15,670
No!

3686
03:37:20,310 --> 03:37:22,050
You tell him.

3687
03:37:23,770 --> 03:37:24,530
She's so brave.

3688
03:37:27,450 --> 03:37:28,090
No!

3689
03:37:29,510 --> 03:37:30,410
Leave me alone.

3690
03:37:30,730 --> 03:37:31,370
Benjamin!

3691
03:37:35,200 --> 03:37:35,700
Yeah man.

3692
03:37:36,020 --> 03:37:36,540
She's here.

3693
03:37:38,460 --> 03:37:40,000
Oh god.

3694
03:37:40,260 --> 03:37:41,360
She's so...

3695
03:37:43,250 --> 03:37:44,500
She's so hopeless.

3696
03:37:45,400 --> 03:37:49,460
Even with this demonic creature in front of her, she's like...

3697
03:37:53,740 --> 03:37:55,940
Oh my god.

3698
03:37:56,300 --> 03:37:57,280
He's so muscular.

3699
03:37:59,260 --> 03:38:00,800
Yeah, kick his ass Benjamin!

3700
03:38:01,940 --> 03:38:03,800
Why is he hot though?

3701
03:38:03,800 --> 03:38:04,660
No!

3702
03:38:08,890 --> 03:38:10,390
He's hot, but he's weak.

3703
03:38:10,930 --> 03:38:11,410
Benjamin!

3704
03:38:15,190 --> 03:38:16,490
He's hot, but he's weak.

3705
03:38:17,250 --> 03:38:19,450
Got taken out by a dang little fox.

3706
03:38:20,950 --> 03:38:21,950
Benjamin or the beast?

3707
03:38:22,010 --> 03:38:22,710
The beast!

3708
03:38:24,210 --> 03:38:24,710
Right?

3709
03:38:24,970 --> 03:38:25,950
You guys meant the beast, right?

3710
03:38:31,050 --> 03:38:32,090
Be aware.

3711
03:38:35,450 --> 03:38:37,050
Did the day start over?

3712
03:38:38,050 --> 03:38:38,670
Misfortune!

3713
03:38:40,270 --> 03:38:42,450
Her secret hiding spot is all...

3714
03:38:43,090 --> 03:38:45,670
Is everything back to normal now?

3715
03:38:45,910 --> 03:38:47,410
There's a doll on the ground now.

3716
03:38:48,210 --> 03:38:48,830
Benji?

3717
03:38:49,030 --> 03:38:50,090
Are you around?

3718
03:38:53,210 --> 03:38:55,550
I guess I have to reveal this.

3719
03:38:55,850 --> 03:38:57,090
I'll make some improvements.

3720
03:38:57,650 --> 03:38:59,890
But first, I want to thank Benjamin.

3721
03:39:04,070 --> 03:39:06,110
Glitter to our broken fort!

3722
03:39:09,150 --> 03:39:10,390
All the birds are gone.

3723
03:39:13,650 --> 03:39:15,270
All the birds are gone.

3724
03:39:16,230 --> 03:39:17,410
Wait, where did our other doll go?

3725
03:39:17,530 --> 03:39:18,770
Find doll number 8.

3726
03:39:18,890 --> 03:39:19,510
I wonder how many...

3727
03:39:19,510 --> 03:39:21,330
I assume this is all of them, right?

3728
03:39:23,290 --> 03:39:24,610
Morko is coming.

3729
03:39:24,610 --> 03:39:26,210
Benjamin, open your eyes.

3730
03:39:26,510 --> 03:39:29,790
He's the voice in your head driving you mad.

3731
03:39:29,950 --> 03:39:32,050
Maybe this should be doll number 1.

3732
03:39:32,270 --> 03:39:34,610
I think whoever labeled these dolls...

3733
03:39:37,420 --> 03:39:41,050
I think this should be the first one that we find.

3734
03:39:43,450 --> 03:39:46,590
Why did you save this for last?

3735
03:39:52,060 --> 03:39:54,080
It's like they don't...

3736
03:39:56,460 --> 03:39:59,080
Yeah, it's like they don't even want you to be saved.

3737
03:40:00,480 --> 03:40:04,000
They don't even want you to be saved because they don't tell you what's going on.

3738
03:40:05,280 --> 03:40:06,220
Oh my god.

3739
03:40:09,580 --> 03:40:10,840
Whose job was that?

3740
03:40:10,900 --> 03:40:11,820
Get them fired.

3741
03:40:13,480 --> 03:40:13,920
Grandma...

3742
03:40:13,920 --> 03:40:16,080
Oh my god, the vase is...

3743
03:40:17,900 --> 03:40:19,080
It's still broken.

3744
03:40:20,180 --> 03:40:22,780
It's really peaceful though, all the bird sounds.

3745
03:40:23,000 --> 03:40:25,480
Benjamin must be a fox onion.

3746
03:40:28,820 --> 03:40:29,880
Oh, the soup.

3747
03:40:32,440 --> 03:40:33,200
Oh, mom?

3748
03:40:47,250 --> 03:40:47,930
Mommy?

3749
03:41:00,750 --> 03:41:01,430
Mommy?

3750
03:41:02,330 --> 03:41:03,390
I'm back.

3751
03:41:06,440 --> 03:41:07,760
Don't ignore me.

3752
03:41:07,760 --> 03:41:12,540
Are you angry because I couldn't get the happiness for you?

3753
03:41:16,580 --> 03:41:18,100
What's happening?

3754
03:41:19,520 --> 03:41:19,740
Mommy?

3755
03:41:23,700 --> 03:41:26,500
This must be a bad dream.

3756
03:41:30,560 --> 03:41:32,240
We can't sparkle anymore.

3757
03:41:32,660 --> 03:41:34,360
We can't sparkle anymore.

3758
03:41:44,470 --> 03:41:46,470
Is that...

3759
03:41:46,470 --> 03:41:47,050
Was

3760
03:41:58,310 --> 03:41:58,830
it you?

3761
03:41:59,670 --> 03:42:00,590
Oh, her glitter.

3762
03:42:05,180 --> 03:42:06,780
Poor baby.

3763
03:42:09,920 --> 03:42:12,000
Look at his awkward smile.

3764
03:42:15,360 --> 03:42:16,700
What's this?

3765
03:42:16,980 --> 03:42:18,160
What's happening?

3766
03:42:22,770 --> 03:42:24,150
We need to go?

3767
03:42:24,690 --> 03:42:25,070
Alright.

3768
03:42:33,640 --> 03:42:35,500
Mommy, are glitters right here?

3769
03:42:38,880 --> 03:42:42,420
I can't tell if it's the mom or the dad that hit her though.

3770
03:42:53,540 --> 03:42:54,480
He's like okay.

3771
03:42:55,580 --> 03:42:56,900
He has such a way with words.

3772
03:43:04,440 --> 03:43:07,220
Mom was cooking, so was dad.

3773
03:43:09,620 --> 03:43:11,280
He's like waving at the mom.

3774
03:43:12,420 --> 03:43:14,180
He's like hi mom.

3775
03:43:23,200 --> 03:43:24,660
I miss you.

3776
03:43:24,940 --> 03:43:26,060
It's so sad.

3777
03:43:28,320 --> 03:43:31,040
Not her being like I was your little misfortune.

3778
03:43:31,660 --> 03:43:33,940
It has like a double meaning and all.

3779
03:43:34,560 --> 03:43:37,020
Like misfortune, like M-I-S-S fortune.

3780
03:43:37,700 --> 03:43:40,960
And also misfortune, like your bad thing.

3781
03:43:44,930 --> 03:43:47,810
I don't think they really wanted her to begin with because...

3782
03:43:51,920 --> 03:43:53,300
It's so sad.

3783
03:43:54,840 --> 03:43:55,980
Yes, that's the point.

3784
03:43:56,060 --> 03:43:57,440
I know, I'm just saying.

3785
03:43:57,800 --> 03:43:58,800
It's just so sad.

3786
03:44:00,280 --> 03:44:00,880
Gosh.

3787
03:44:04,060 --> 03:44:05,660
Okie dokie, here we go.

3788
03:44:07,260 --> 03:44:10,280
Time to see if I got all the sparkles or not.

3789
03:44:12,540 --> 03:44:13,740
So sad.

3790
03:44:24,130 --> 03:44:25,510
Wait, stop, Benjamin.

3791
03:44:26,190 --> 03:44:27,210
Where are we going?

3792
03:44:31,610 --> 03:44:33,790
Oh my gosh, I can still sparkle.

3793
03:44:33,790 --> 03:44:37,910
Ok, we're walking.

3794
03:44:39,230 --> 03:44:40,270
And I'm sparkling.

3795
03:44:41,270 --> 03:44:42,170
And I'm walking.

3796
03:44:43,790 --> 03:44:47,710
I'm running.

3797
03:44:48,150 --> 03:44:49,310
Oh my god!

3798
03:44:51,590 --> 03:44:53,310
Ah, the puppy!

3799
03:44:55,350 --> 03:44:57,050
I'm going puppy, I'm going.

3800
03:44:58,750 --> 03:44:59,870
Brisk jog.

3801
03:45:00,250 --> 03:45:01,930
Oh my gosh, it's so cute.

3802
03:45:04,250 --> 03:45:07,310
Oh my god, pinecone people.

3803
03:45:15,850 --> 03:45:17,790
RPG party right here.

3804
03:45:21,290 --> 03:45:23,470
Oh, he runs when I run too.

3805
03:45:23,630 --> 03:45:24,790
Speed up, dog!

3806
03:45:25,690 --> 03:45:28,750
Oh my god, Grim Warper.

3807
03:45:32,510 --> 03:45:35,810
That's the Grim Reaper, but a worm.

3808
03:45:37,390 --> 03:45:38,950
Kick the dog, keep going.

3809
03:45:39,190 --> 03:45:40,650
Push the dog to go faster.

3810
03:45:45,570 --> 03:45:46,130
Pigapines.

3811
03:45:46,870 --> 03:45:47,910
Centipedes, but pigs.

3812
03:45:50,210 --> 03:45:51,410
Run, run, run!

3813
03:45:52,510 --> 03:45:52,890
Run!

3814
03:46:02,610 --> 03:46:04,130
Would not bring me joy.

3815
03:46:06,170 --> 03:46:09,570
I'm feeling Benjamin, where the hell are we going?

3816
03:46:10,330 --> 03:46:13,370
Benjamin, are you sure this is the good afterlife?

3817
03:46:15,370 --> 03:46:16,150
Benjamin?

3818
03:46:17,730 --> 03:46:19,990
Oh my god, Dapper Skelly.

3819
03:46:20,370 --> 03:46:22,310
I kinda love that guy actually.

3820
03:46:24,710 --> 03:46:27,130
Why was he setting the berries on fire though?

3821
03:46:29,690 --> 03:46:30,130
Run!

3822
03:46:32,030 --> 03:46:33,870
One last sparkle!

3823
03:46:35,650 --> 03:46:37,210
Bonser Skelly.

3824
03:46:38,870 --> 03:46:41,210
This place is really cold.

3825
03:46:41,850 --> 03:46:43,070
Good thing you got a jacket.

3826
03:46:45,970 --> 03:46:46,770
Oh.

3827
03:46:49,990 --> 03:46:52,090
We finally pet the dog!

3828
03:46:59,490 --> 03:47:00,290
Ok.

3829
03:47:01,650 --> 03:47:03,510
We must ring the tree.

3830
03:47:04,390 --> 03:47:05,050
Oh, my bad.

3831
03:47:07,450 --> 03:47:09,010
Here we go.

3832
03:47:18,750 --> 03:47:19,930
Oh.

3833
03:47:22,420 --> 03:47:24,790
Uncover all the sparkles!

3834
03:47:25,910 --> 03:47:27,850
Oh, we did it!

3835
03:47:28,390 --> 03:47:28,710
Yeah!

3836
03:47:30,490 --> 03:47:32,930
Oh my gosh, lucky!

3837
03:47:34,850 --> 03:47:36,270
Doll number 9.

3838
03:47:37,730 --> 03:47:41,310
All around disasters seem to disappear.

3839
03:47:41,310 --> 03:47:46,510
The weird messed up way the parasite...more of a paternal figure, yeah.

3840
03:47:48,870 --> 03:47:51,510
Deep inside the fog you defeat him!

3841
03:47:56,310 --> 03:47:57,430
That guy is dead.

3842
03:47:57,970 --> 03:48:02,370
True ending time!

3843
03:48:02,470 --> 03:48:08,790
Oh my god!

3844
03:48:11,310 --> 03:48:13,170
Little lady!

3845
03:48:17,490 --> 03:48:21,070
She is so brave.

3846
03:48:27,070 --> 03:48:30,350
There she goes.

3847
03:48:35,540 --> 03:48:37,240
Lady Death is kinda hot.

3848
03:48:52,110 --> 03:48:53,230
She is single?

3849
03:48:58,690 --> 03:49:00,610
Oh my gosh, it's you guys!

3850
03:49:03,270 --> 03:49:04,410
There you go!

3851
03:49:04,890 --> 03:49:06,810
Where are you gonna go with your new freedom?

3852
03:49:07,810 --> 03:49:08,770
What are you gonna do?

3853
03:49:17,600 --> 03:49:21,300
I don't think I've ever seen the true end before for this.

3854
03:49:41,360 --> 03:49:43,560
The happiness went to the mom!

3855
03:49:45,380 --> 03:49:47,020
She took off her mask!

3856
03:49:47,620 --> 03:49:49,780
Give mommy the eternal happiness.

3857
03:49:50,440 --> 03:49:51,760
Why is she smiling?

3858
03:49:52,120 --> 03:49:53,100
Your kid just died.

3859
03:49:53,960 --> 03:49:54,480
Wait, what?

3860
03:50:01,580 --> 03:50:03,720
Wait, that didn't make me feel any better.

3861
03:50:05,960 --> 03:50:06,460
Um...

3862
03:50:09,520 --> 03:50:11,120
Win the game.

3863
03:50:15,220 --> 03:50:16,660
Going for the MILF.

3864
03:50:16,880 --> 03:50:17,960
Classic Wisp move.

3865
03:50:21,300 --> 03:50:23,180
My kid is dead, let's go!

3866
03:50:24,380 --> 03:50:26,080
Because she knows she is in a happy place.

3867
03:50:26,160 --> 03:50:28,120
Maybe she knew that she was a terrible mother.

3868
03:50:28,720 --> 03:50:31,600
It's kinda like, maybe she's smiling because she got away with it.

3869
03:50:33,160 --> 03:50:34,580
It's so messed up!

3870
03:50:35,000 --> 03:50:36,080
I know, right?

3871
03:50:37,780 --> 03:50:41,420
I feel like maybe she knew she was a bad mom and just didn't know how to...

3872
03:50:41,420 --> 03:50:43,600
She was stuck in a cycle and didn't know how to change it.

3873
03:50:43,640 --> 03:50:46,980
And then she was like, oh, my kid is in a better place.

3874
03:50:47,160 --> 03:50:48,920
But that's a little soon to be smiling.

3875
03:50:49,360 --> 03:50:50,900
She's not even buried yet.

3876
03:50:51,280 --> 03:50:53,600
She's like still on the ground.

3877
03:50:54,080 --> 03:50:56,760
Like, damn, the body is still warm!

3878
03:50:57,820 --> 03:50:58,220
Like...

3879
03:50:59,800 --> 03:51:00,600
Come on!

3880
03:51:01,840 --> 03:51:02,640
Yikes forever.

3881
03:51:03,720 --> 03:51:06,440
I don't know if that ending made me feel any better or not.

3882
03:51:19,560 --> 03:51:22,660
Dang, I thought the true end would make me be like, yeah!

3883
03:51:23,220 --> 03:51:24,860
City dropped the charges, let's go!

3884
03:51:26,040 --> 03:51:27,840
All she had to be like is, wait, wait, wait.

3885
03:51:28,160 --> 03:51:29,640
My kid is in a better place.

3886
03:51:30,040 --> 03:51:30,920
And you'd be like, oh, yeah.

3887
03:51:31,220 --> 03:51:32,200
You know what, you're so right.

3888
03:51:32,200 --> 03:51:35,200
And then all is forgiven.

3889
03:51:38,080 --> 03:51:40,040
That was not at all cathartic.

3890
03:51:40,300 --> 03:51:42,000
I was sprinkling everything.

3891
03:51:44,000 --> 03:51:47,260
We gave mommy the eternal happiness by not existing anymore.

3892
03:51:49,580 --> 03:51:53,020
You know what, that mom didn't deserve a little misfortune.

3893
03:51:53,200 --> 03:51:55,000
Because she was just too cute.

3894
03:51:56,540 --> 03:51:58,340
She got Isekai to become a Vtuber.

3895
03:51:58,940 --> 03:52:00,060
I'm a little lady too.

3896
03:52:00,060 --> 03:52:01,180
Hold on, Minto.

3897
03:52:01,340 --> 03:52:02,500
Oh my gosh, lady.

3898
03:52:04,340 --> 03:52:05,580
Thanks for three months.

3899
03:52:11,690 --> 03:52:14,610
If it's the dad that hit misfortune, double happiness I guess.

3900
03:52:14,650 --> 03:52:17,530
Yeah, she gets out of a marriage, she gets out of having a kid.

3901
03:52:17,610 --> 03:52:19,650
She's just like, I get to start all over.

3902
03:52:20,190 --> 03:52:21,990
Yeah, but it's so messed up too.

3903
03:52:22,070 --> 03:52:24,710
Because misfortune was just like a little kid.

3904
03:52:24,930 --> 03:52:26,290
She didn't even get to live her life.

3905
03:52:26,990 --> 03:52:30,350
You know, you live with the mistakes that you made because you're an adult, mom.

3906
03:52:31,090 --> 03:52:32,810
But let the kid live her life.

3907
03:52:33,730 --> 03:52:35,710
Finally a parrot worse than me.

3908
03:52:37,550 --> 03:52:38,230
Huey.

3909
03:52:41,750 --> 03:52:42,970
Nah, Huey.

3910
03:52:43,750 --> 03:52:46,490
You still get to keep that title.

3911
03:52:48,150 --> 03:52:49,690
Thanks for the six months.

3912
03:52:50,510 --> 03:52:52,510
Kid gave her super magical happiness.

3913
03:52:52,930 --> 03:52:54,510
Not her fault she's suddenly happy.

3914
03:52:54,610 --> 03:52:56,470
That's true, it was supernatural happiness.

3915
03:52:57,430 --> 03:52:59,350
She couldn't control it, I suppose.

3916
03:53:03,730 --> 03:53:05,890
Yeah, Huey still is the worst parent.

3917
03:53:08,030 --> 03:53:08,950
Not that saying.

3918
03:53:09,490 --> 03:53:10,950
Not saying a pro-Huey.

3919
03:53:11,110 --> 03:53:13,490
No, we're never, we're not, no pro-Huey here.

3920
03:53:15,450 --> 03:53:19,510
My client's child is being taken care of by Lady Death now, who is hot.

3921
03:53:19,650 --> 03:53:20,690
I rest my case.

3922
03:53:22,390 --> 03:53:23,950
Hey Minto, it's my aunt's birthday.

3923
03:53:24,530 --> 03:53:25,470
Oh my gosh!

3924
03:53:25,770 --> 03:53:27,830
Happy birthday John's aunt!

3925
03:53:29,230 --> 03:53:30,830
Or do you say aunt?

3926
03:53:31,530 --> 03:53:32,710
It's your aunt.

3927
03:53:38,070 --> 03:53:39,350
Oh, it was a typo.

3928
03:53:39,690 --> 03:53:40,990
No, we're not pro-Huey.

3929
03:53:42,450 --> 03:53:43,490
Music forever.

3930
03:53:44,550 --> 03:53:46,330
Music you can dance to forever.

3931
03:53:46,670 --> 03:53:47,230
Is there an after?

3932
03:53:55,870 --> 03:53:57,150
Cinematics, oh the dolls.

3933
03:53:59,590 --> 03:54:01,470
Oh, they all look different.

3934
03:54:02,310 --> 03:54:03,470
That's cute.

3935
03:54:03,850 --> 03:54:05,150
So there were only nine of them?

3936
03:54:08,990 --> 03:54:10,250
Art gallery.

3937
03:54:11,110 --> 03:54:12,210
Oh, cute.

3938
03:54:13,010 --> 03:54:14,970
Oh, these are so cute!

3939
03:54:15,870 --> 03:54:18,090
Oh, I love this one.

3940
03:54:19,130 --> 03:54:23,090
I love this one.

3941
03:54:24,550 --> 03:54:25,310
Fantasmagoria.

3942
03:54:26,210 --> 03:54:27,670
Oh, it's scary.

3943
03:54:28,670 --> 03:54:30,690
This one's so sweet too.

3944
03:54:31,370 --> 03:54:32,410
Oh, cute.

3945
03:54:33,150 --> 03:54:36,350
It's the first animal she got to pet was the deer.

3946
03:54:36,510 --> 03:54:37,590
A dream come true.

3947
03:54:38,430 --> 03:54:39,730
Oh, these must be...

3948
03:54:39,730 --> 03:54:41,430
Okay, so these are all the backgrounds.

3949
03:54:42,370 --> 03:54:44,170
That would be the title screen.

3950
03:54:44,770 --> 03:54:46,150
Yeah, because we had this one.

3951
03:54:46,910 --> 03:54:47,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3952
03:54:48,150 --> 03:54:50,170
Oh, so fun.

3953
03:54:56,890 --> 03:54:58,130
And then the cinematics.

3954
03:54:58,250 --> 03:54:59,150
Oh, we missed one.

3955
03:55:02,250 --> 03:55:03,830
I wonder what it would have been.

3956
03:55:05,830 --> 03:55:07,710
Oh, it's the...

3957
03:55:07,710 --> 03:55:10,310
Because we got the house of horrors, this is the carousel.

3958
03:55:11,510 --> 03:55:13,850
Or sorry, the marigold carousel, yeah.

3959
03:55:15,310 --> 03:55:16,250
That must be it.

3960
03:55:18,070 --> 03:55:20,050
Kind of a solid hit right in the feels.

3961
03:55:27,730 --> 03:55:29,810
Guess we needed to cause more chaos.

3962
03:55:31,430 --> 03:55:35,570
No, I think it's because we remember at the Fantasmagoria we could only pick one ride.

3963
03:55:35,670 --> 03:55:39,790
So it was either the haunted house or the carousel and we chose the haunted house.

3964
03:55:39,910 --> 03:55:40,710
Well, I did.

3965
03:55:41,450 --> 03:55:44,430
I executive ordered the haunted house.

3966
03:55:44,690 --> 03:55:46,270
But we got all the other ones, nice.

3967
03:55:46,850 --> 03:55:50,210
We like nearly feel... I wonder if I like 100%ed this.

3968
03:55:50,850 --> 03:55:51,630
Or almost.

3969
03:55:51,770 --> 03:55:52,970
Let's see, what's...

3970
03:55:53,910 --> 03:55:54,430
Oh, no.

3971
03:55:55,450 --> 03:55:57,450
26 out of 35.

3972
03:55:57,790 --> 03:55:59,010
Let's see what achievements.

3973
03:55:59,430 --> 03:56:00,610
Hit the alarm.

3974
03:56:01,010 --> 03:56:01,610
Sniper?

3975
03:56:02,170 --> 03:56:04,550
What alarm?

3976
03:56:06,490 --> 03:56:09,310
Doggy treat is give the cutie a treat.

3977
03:56:09,690 --> 03:56:11,970
Rotten fish, bury Rodrigo.

3978
03:56:12,370 --> 03:56:13,990
We could have buried him.

3979
03:56:14,970 --> 03:56:16,870
Little cutie, learn the name of the puppy.

3980
03:56:17,470 --> 03:56:18,670
Read your fortune cookie.

3981
03:56:18,790 --> 03:56:20,090
When the hell do these happen?

3982
03:56:20,590 --> 03:56:22,070
Dance the entire song.

3983
03:56:22,730 --> 03:56:24,170
Don't fix the vase.

3984
03:56:25,370 --> 03:56:26,490
Ride all the rides.

3985
03:56:26,730 --> 03:56:28,770
Oh wait, I could have ridden both rides.

3986
03:56:29,750 --> 03:56:30,970
I got cheated.

3987
03:56:32,750 --> 03:56:36,430
I honestly thought at the start that the narrator would be Death the Grim Reaper watching over her.

3988
03:56:36,510 --> 03:56:39,210
Not some Wendigo-Eyed Skinwalker looking at her.

3989
03:56:40,270 --> 03:56:40,650
Yeah.

3990
03:56:41,570 --> 03:56:43,850
You kind of get that vibe from him.

3991
03:56:44,130 --> 03:56:47,350
But it's not... He seems so like innocent in the beginning.

3992
03:56:47,550 --> 03:56:50,090
But he definitely shows his colors mid-game.

3993
03:56:50,090 --> 03:56:50,930
Yeah.

3994
03:56:52,310 --> 03:56:53,870
The beast from over the garden wall.

3995
03:56:54,070 --> 03:56:54,210
Right!

3996
03:56:55,370 --> 03:56:57,250
And then the last achievement is...

3997
03:56:57,650 --> 03:56:59,450
Ride the twister until you puke.

3998
03:57:02,870 --> 03:57:05,030
Doesn't seem like there's any hidden ones.

3999
03:57:05,870 --> 03:57:07,650
Oh, I got most of them though.

4000
03:57:07,750 --> 03:57:09,370
I got 26 out of 35.

4001
03:57:10,550 --> 03:57:11,030
Nice.

4002
03:57:11,930 --> 03:57:13,090
This game is so sweet.

4003
03:57:14,030 --> 03:57:14,870
So sad.

4004
03:57:16,390 --> 03:57:18,070
It's sad, but it's like...

4005
03:57:18,070 --> 03:57:21,430
And it has like obviously really dark themes to it, but...

4006
03:57:21,430 --> 03:57:24,650
It doesn't feel... Like it's a little whimsy.

4007
03:57:24,830 --> 03:57:26,470
It's got some sort of whimsy about it.

4008
03:57:26,670 --> 03:57:29,390
That kind of like makes it feel not so bad.

4009
03:57:29,430 --> 03:57:31,710
Like it's easy to joke about it, I suppose, you know.

4010
03:57:34,010 --> 03:57:34,930
Read the dolls?

4011
03:57:35,150 --> 03:57:36,110
They have new me... Oh, they do?

4012
03:57:40,310 --> 03:57:41,170
No, it doesn't.

4013
03:57:41,650 --> 03:57:43,630
Everything begins with the song of a Jackdaw.

4014
03:57:43,730 --> 03:57:46,630
These are the same lines as before.

4015
03:57:46,630 --> 03:57:48,450
Unloved children.

4016
03:57:49,030 --> 03:57:51,150
They receive a gift from the beyond.

4017
03:57:51,470 --> 03:57:52,370
Yeah, these are all the same.

4018
03:57:53,470 --> 03:57:54,110
Morgul.

4019
03:57:55,710 --> 03:57:57,090
Deep inside the fog you defeat them.

4020
03:58:01,450 --> 03:58:02,730
All good.

4021
03:58:03,170 --> 03:58:03,710
All good.

4022
03:58:04,690 --> 03:58:06,210
Oh my gosh, guys.

4023
03:58:07,890 --> 03:58:08,530
Tomorrow...

4024
03:58:08,530 --> 03:58:09,630
Is my...

4025
03:58:10,290 --> 03:58:10,790
Pre-debut.

4026
03:58:12,810 --> 03:58:15,390
I just want it to happen now.

4027
03:58:15,390 --> 03:58:18,030
Oh gosh, tomorrow is going to be so slow for me.

4028
03:58:19,370 --> 03:58:21,810
I'm just going to be sitting in my room.

4029
03:58:22,130 --> 03:58:24,130
Just wiggling back and forth like...

4030
03:58:24,130 --> 03:58:24,550
Is it time?

4031
03:58:24,810 --> 03:58:25,050
No.

4032
03:58:25,290 --> 03:58:25,850
Is it time?

4033
03:58:26,050 --> 03:58:26,270
No.

4034
03:58:26,550 --> 03:58:27,070
Is it time?

4035
03:58:27,270 --> 03:58:27,570
No.

4036
03:58:28,130 --> 03:58:29,570
Even though not everything is done.

4037
03:58:29,950 --> 03:58:32,310
So, you know, maybe I should have everything finished first.

4038
03:58:32,550 --> 03:58:33,170
And then be like...

4039
03:58:33,170 --> 03:58:33,570
Is it time?

4040
03:58:33,730 --> 03:58:33,890
No.

4041
03:58:34,130 --> 03:58:34,570
Is it time?

4042
03:58:34,730 --> 03:58:34,870
No.

4043
03:58:35,110 --> 03:58:35,530
Is it time?

4044
03:58:35,670 --> 03:58:35,850
No.

4045
03:58:39,570 --> 03:58:40,550
Guerrilla pre-debut.

4046
03:58:40,930 --> 03:58:42,570
Yeah, what if I just did it right now?

4047
03:58:43,530 --> 03:58:45,870
Screw having the planned debut.

4048
03:58:46,170 --> 03:58:47,610
What if I did it now?

4049
03:58:48,670 --> 03:58:51,310
It's crazy too because I announced it a month ago.

4050
03:58:51,410 --> 03:58:52,570
So I've just been like...

4051
03:58:53,170 --> 03:58:55,390
Twiddling my thumbs for an entire month.

4052
03:58:56,310 --> 03:58:57,330
Finally, tomorrow.

4053
03:58:58,050 --> 03:58:59,530
Finally, tomorrow.

4054
03:59:00,290 --> 03:59:01,630
Super mega ultra hype.

4055
03:59:01,890 --> 03:59:03,010
Woohoo, tomorrow.

4056
03:59:05,270 --> 03:59:07,750
Oh my gosh, give us a tease.

4057
03:59:07,890 --> 03:59:08,210
No.

4058
03:59:08,970 --> 03:59:10,030
No tease.

4059
03:59:10,150 --> 03:59:10,710
No tease.

4060
03:59:14,650 --> 03:59:15,190
Tomorrow.

4061
03:59:16,890 --> 03:59:17,430
Tomorrow.

4062
03:59:18,750 --> 03:59:19,290
Tomorrow.

4063
03:59:20,510 --> 03:59:23,350
I can be patient for just 24 more hours.

4064
03:59:23,530 --> 03:59:25,270
Even less than 24 more hours.

4065
03:59:25,490 --> 03:59:27,970
I can be patient for one more day.

4066
03:59:29,430 --> 03:59:31,490
Thank you, Minto 2.0.

4067
03:59:33,730 --> 03:59:35,030
Tomorrow is going to be...

4068
03:59:35,030 --> 03:59:36,490
There might be some scuff though.

4069
03:59:36,590 --> 03:59:38,910
Because I didn't quite plan a script for some stuff.

4070
03:59:38,910 --> 03:59:39,730
So...

4071
03:59:40,850 --> 03:59:42,250
We'll just see how...

4072
03:59:42,250 --> 03:59:45,130
I'll just wing it as I always do, baby.

4073
03:59:47,550 --> 03:59:50,230
Thank you, Minto 2.0.

4074
03:59:50,730 --> 03:59:55,230
What a stream to have as my last 2.0 one, huh?

4075
03:59:55,670 --> 03:59:56,810
Well, full 2.0.

4076
03:59:57,130 --> 03:59:59,630
You'll still see me tomorrow like this a little bit.

4077
04:00:01,730 --> 04:00:02,670
Thank you for everything.

4078
04:00:07,630 --> 04:00:09,790
Hopefully not too much scuff though.

4079
04:00:10,270 --> 04:00:11,810
I have some cool things to show off.

4080
04:00:14,190 --> 04:00:14,470
Yeah.

4081
04:00:15,910 --> 04:00:16,750
Oh gosh.

4082
04:00:16,890 --> 04:00:17,070
Okay.

4083
04:00:18,670 --> 04:00:21,330
Well, I'm going to go then so I can sleep.

4084
04:00:21,470 --> 04:00:22,830
And then tomorrow will come faster.

4085
04:00:25,570 --> 04:00:26,410
Thank you.

4086
04:00:27,090 --> 04:00:29,190
This game had a lot of funny and strange parts.

4087
04:00:29,190 --> 04:00:31,750
And I think that made the stuff near the end hit harder.

4088
04:00:31,950 --> 04:00:32,950
Thanks for playing, Minto.

4089
04:00:33,050 --> 04:00:34,430
Really excited for tomorrow.

4090
04:00:34,510 --> 04:00:35,170
Thank you.

4091
04:00:37,430 --> 04:00:39,930
The... Oh, the Ghostbusters Krispy Kreme.

4092
04:00:39,990 --> 04:00:40,790
I have seen it.

4093
04:00:40,850 --> 04:00:41,790
I didn't try it though.

4094
04:00:42,210 --> 04:00:43,370
I didn't try it.

4095
04:00:43,990 --> 04:00:45,170
Yeah, I think about this game...

4096
04:00:45,170 --> 04:00:48,290
The one thing I really love about games is when they're very silly.

4097
04:00:48,650 --> 04:00:53,710
And then also very emotional, I guess.

4098
04:00:53,790 --> 04:00:54,930
I don't want to say sad.

4099
04:00:55,570 --> 04:00:56,590
But like, you know...

4100
04:00:56,590 --> 04:00:57,450
Like Metal Gear.

4101
04:00:57,450 --> 04:00:59,890
Sorry, I talked about Metal Gear a lot today.

4102
04:01:00,170 --> 04:01:04,890
I've been having withdrawals of talking about Metal Gear, I think, recently.

4103
04:01:07,110 --> 04:01:08,110
Thanks for the fun stream.

4104
04:01:08,210 --> 04:01:09,170
Can't wait for 3.0 tomorrow.

4105
04:01:09,570 --> 04:01:10,070
Thank you.

4106
04:01:10,390 --> 04:01:11,950
One more bust in for 2.0.

4107
04:01:12,630 --> 04:01:13,770
Yeah, we should.

4108
04:01:14,430 --> 04:01:14,830
Actually...

4109
04:01:15,830 --> 04:01:17,450
So every time I do...

4110
04:01:18,090 --> 04:01:18,810
Oh my gosh.

4111
04:01:18,990 --> 04:01:19,390
Hold on.

4112
04:01:19,470 --> 04:01:21,310
Actually, I'm going to go to my maid cafe.

4113
04:01:21,750 --> 04:01:22,150
Real quick.

4114
04:01:22,210 --> 04:01:22,630
One second.

4115
04:01:23,650 --> 04:01:24,430
Quit the game.

4116
04:01:24,590 --> 04:01:25,690
Oh, it froze.

4117
04:01:25,690 --> 04:01:26,670
Hello?

4118
04:01:27,490 --> 04:01:27,970
Quit the game.

4119
04:01:28,030 --> 04:01:29,130
Oh, it froze.

4120
04:01:29,610 --> 04:01:31,010
Oh, the game is not responding.

4121
04:01:31,670 --> 04:01:35,690
When I play Bustin' now, my stream gets copyrighted.

4122
04:01:38,870 --> 04:01:39,910
Or like...

4123
04:01:39,910 --> 04:01:41,870
Yeah, so it's kind of annoying.

4124
04:01:44,450 --> 04:01:45,470
Welcome to membership.

4125
04:01:45,670 --> 04:01:46,170
Thank you.

4126
04:01:46,690 --> 04:01:47,930
Thank you so much.

4127
04:01:49,310 --> 04:01:50,350
Yeah, so...

4128
04:01:50,350 --> 04:01:52,730
Like what I did with the karaoke and everything...

4129
04:01:52,730 --> 04:01:54,110
Hold on, let me control...

4130
04:01:54,110 --> 04:01:55,030
Oh, close the program.

4131
04:01:55,030 --> 04:01:55,470
Never mind.

4132
04:01:56,790 --> 04:01:59,190
So that's why I haven't been doing it so much.

4133
04:01:59,490 --> 04:02:04,190
Because every stream has been getting claimed with it, so...

4134
04:02:05,150 --> 04:02:06,190
But this one is okay.

4135
04:02:06,370 --> 04:02:08,070
We can for one last one with...

4136
04:02:08,970 --> 04:02:09,510
Oh, hold on.

4137
04:02:11,610 --> 04:02:12,930
With the 2.0.

4138
04:02:17,610 --> 04:02:18,050
Okay.

4139
04:02:19,290 --> 04:02:19,730
Okay.

4140
04:02:20,070 --> 04:02:20,730
What a bother.

4141
04:02:20,990 --> 04:02:21,590
I know, right?

4142
04:02:27,610 --> 04:02:29,310
Da-da-da-da-da...

4143
04:02:31,450 --> 04:02:32,530
Where is it?

4144
04:02:36,030 --> 04:02:39,030
I'll turn it down low just a little bit.

4145
04:02:46,230 --> 04:02:47,510
Thank you for the 20 gifts!

4146
04:02:48,130 --> 04:02:48,790
Thank you!

4147
04:02:56,570 --> 04:02:58,710
If there is something strange...

4148
04:02:58,710 --> 04:03:00,110
Sleeping in your bed.

4149
04:03:02,790 --> 04:03:03,730
Let me tell you something.

4150
04:03:03,790 --> 04:03:04,750
Teresa, thank you!

4151
04:03:04,890 --> 04:03:05,750
VOD gang tomorrow.

4152
04:03:05,930 --> 04:03:06,570
So happy Halloween.

4153
04:03:06,570 --> 04:03:08,550
So happy Halloween!

4154
04:03:09,430 --> 04:03:10,110
Oh my gosh.

4155
04:03:10,230 --> 04:03:13,550
If I stream for one more hour, we would have gotten Halloween.

4156
04:03:17,830 --> 04:03:28,990
Busted, busted, busted...

4157
04:03:33,030 --> 04:03:35,270
Can you hear it okay at least?

4158
04:03:35,270 --> 04:03:36,390
Just a little bit maybe.

4159
04:03:38,070 --> 04:03:40,750
If you're saying thanks...

4160
04:03:40,750 --> 04:03:42,050
Sleeping in your bed.

4161
04:03:46,970 --> 04:03:48,330
Invisible bed.

4162
04:03:49,070 --> 04:03:49,730
Sleeping in...

4163
04:03:49,730 --> 04:03:52,550
Let me tell you something.

4164
04:03:59,530 --> 04:04:02,510
Busted, busted, busted...

4165
04:04:03,510 --> 04:04:11,350
Feel good, feel good, feel good...

4166
04:04:11,350 --> 04:04:27,650
Feel good, feel good, feel good...

4167
04:04:31,270 --> 04:04:33,630
Freaky ghost man!

4168
04:04:35,350 --> 04:04:37,830
Freaky ghost man!

4169
04:04:39,550 --> 04:04:41,610
Freaky man baby!

4170
04:04:47,000 --> 04:04:49,040
Let me sleep in your bed.

4171
04:04:54,270 --> 04:04:55,590
Let me tell you something.

4172
04:04:56,370 --> 04:04:58,430
Sleeping makes me feel good!

4173
04:04:59,190 --> 04:04:59,990
I'm gonna sleep.

4174
04:04:59,990 --> 04:05:01,890
Oh my gosh, I hope I can sleep tonight.

4175
04:05:02,750 --> 04:05:04,070
I ain't afraid of no sleep.

4176
04:05:04,750 --> 04:05:06,090
I ain't afraid of no bed.

4177
04:05:06,650 --> 04:05:07,810
I'm gonna be too excited.

4178
04:05:07,950 --> 04:05:09,030
I won't be able to sleep.

4179
04:05:10,590 --> 04:05:11,950
An invisible man.

4180
04:05:12,530 --> 04:05:13,010
Oh, bed.

4181
04:05:13,410 --> 04:05:13,750
Sleep.

4182
04:05:14,170 --> 04:05:15,430
Freaky ghost bed.

4183
04:05:15,510 --> 04:05:17,050
Oh my god, I got the lyrics wrong.

4184
04:05:18,410 --> 04:05:20,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4185
04:05:21,150 --> 04:05:23,610
Busted, busted, busted...

4186
04:05:27,030 --> 04:05:29,790
Makes me feel good, feel good...

4187
04:05:29,790 --> 04:05:33,070
Feel good, feel good, feel good...

4188
04:05:35,930 --> 04:05:38,690
Sorry I can't make it to Atlanta to be there for you.

4189
04:05:38,730 --> 04:05:39,510
It's all good!

4190
04:05:39,730 --> 04:05:40,650
Here's five bucks.

4191
04:05:40,970 --> 04:05:44,010
Pick me next time when you buy your next pack of smokes.

4192
04:05:46,310 --> 04:05:47,790
Oh, I just ran out.

4193
04:05:47,890 --> 04:05:48,650
Thanks, cool.

4194
04:05:50,350 --> 04:05:51,570
I'll do that.

4195
04:05:54,650 --> 04:05:55,690
Busted, busted...

4196
04:05:55,690 --> 04:05:58,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

4197
04:05:58,070 --> 04:06:00,350
Busted, busted, busted...

4198
04:06:00,350 --> 04:06:03,530
Makes me feel good, feel good...

4199
04:06:03,530 --> 04:06:06,150
Feel good, feel good, feel good...

4200
04:06:11,450 --> 04:06:15,730
I hope you guys had a fun Halloween month.

4201
04:06:17,910 --> 04:06:25,390
I'm glad we got to play lots of Halloween spooky games and do some Halloween activities like the cookies and everything.

4202
04:06:25,390 --> 04:06:30,730
Have a great night, and I'll see you guys tomorrow in my new fall!

4203
04:06:33,420 --> 04:06:34,340
Let's do my stand.

4204
04:06:35,120 --> 04:06:36,000
Thank you!

4205
04:06:38,270 --> 04:06:39,090
Thank you, thank you!

4206
04:06:39,370 --> 04:06:39,810
Otsumito!

4207
04:06:43,000 --> 04:06:43,240
Bye!

4208
04:06:43,600 --> 04:06:43,980
Itadakimasu!

4209
04:06:44,640 --> 04:06:47,180
Wait, let me make sure that it's not...

4210
04:06:47,180 --> 04:06:49,140
I've been like, obviously testing stuff out.

4211
04:06:49,220 --> 04:06:49,560
Okay, good.

4212
04:06:49,780 --> 04:06:50,620
It's not the new one.

4213
04:06:50,880 --> 04:06:51,480
Okay, bye bye!
