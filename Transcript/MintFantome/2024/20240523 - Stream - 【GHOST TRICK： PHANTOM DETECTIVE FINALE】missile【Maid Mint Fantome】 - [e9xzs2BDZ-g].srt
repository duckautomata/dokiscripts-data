1
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:53,390
Oh gosh, I do not hide.

2
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,510
Oh gosh, I'll hate you.

3
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,950
Hey, thank you!

4
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:03,830
Welcome back to GhostTree!

5
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,330
My guitar is a Nexter, the Five Kipling these are my final
characters.

6
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:17,670
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, Hello,

7
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,050
hello, hello, hello, hello.

8
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,030
My voice is kind of icky today.

9
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:21,850
Oh my goodness.

10
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,590
Maybe I've been talking too much recently.

11
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,170
I'm so excited to finish the game.

12
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,330
Yippee!

13
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,930
Yo, Zaki, thanks for the tag gifted.

14
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,650
Star Creator, thanks for the tag gifted.

15
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,690
Thank you guys.

16
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,550
Thank you so much.

17
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,630
Not great for a VA heavy game.

18
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,290
That's okay.

19
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,650
I think we'll, uh...

20
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,950
I think we'll persevere.

21
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,110
I think so.

22
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,750
Um, what else?

23
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,610
What was I gonna say?

24
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:58,930
Mmm...

25
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,640
I don't remember.

26
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,320
I think, uh...

27
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,500
Oh!

28
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,720
I was messing around with some stuff.

29
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,620
You might notice some differences.

30
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:15,640
Hmm.

31
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,720
Maybe they're not so obvious, though.

32
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:19,760
Maybe.

33
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,580
Spenkenheim!

34
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,560
Thanks for that order!

35
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,560
Gifted!

36
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,680
Thank you so much!

37
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,460
Thank you.

38
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,800
I think my voice is all wacky because I haven't really
spoken today.

39
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,220
Oh yeah, hold on.

40
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,770
I'm quite unobservant.

41
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,730
That's okay.

42
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,170
And the gamer with OBS or...

43
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:47,990
No.

44
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,450
With me!

45
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,110
Did you cut your hair?

46
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:54,890
No.

47
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,950
It's still so flowy.

48
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:00,770
Yeah.

49
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,410
Did you get a new haircut?

50
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,630
No.

51
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,310
You're extra cute today.

52
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,340
You're higher up.

53
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,420
Oh, am I too high?

54
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,500
Let me.

55
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,440
There we go.

56
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,240
Does Amir is meant extra cute today?

57
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:31,620
Okay.

58
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,220
Why both of you saying that?

59
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,840
Was this an orchestrated effort?

60
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,700
I don't appreciate it.

61
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,300
I don't appreciate this.

62
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,860
But what I do appreciate is beating the game!

63
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,100
Woohoo!

64
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,240
Yeah!

65
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,540
Let's get right into it.

66
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,100
We have...

67
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,920
Hold on.

68
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,140
I'm just gonna go to chat.

69
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,360
just like because I don't remember.

70
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,040
We're on chapter 15.

71
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,080
15, 16, 17.

72
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,320
We have four chapters left.

73
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,300
And then we'll beat the game.

74
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,420
Yippee!

75
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:25,700
And I'm excited because last night, it ended on like a crazy
info dump cliffhanger, everything, everything.

76
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,800
So Mint is extra cute today.

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,680
Word on the stream.

78
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,700
Minto is cute today.

79
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:40,870
I I told you to cut it out!

80
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,630
Huh?

81
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,300
Anyway.

82
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,300
Any, anyway, anyway.

83
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,560
Thank you, thank you!

84
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,800
I completed making the homemade Memphis-style barbecue sauce
for my barbecue pulled pork complete with a side of homemade

85
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,180
slaw.

86
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,400
How are you?

87
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,300
How are you so competent?

88
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,020
How are you so competent?

89
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,460
I don't understand!

90
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,440
Minto, kawaii.

91
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,160
I'm overwhelmed by how cute Minto said I can't handle it.

92
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,500
I can't handle you!

93
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,920
I can't handle this.

94
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,480
Okay, so...

95
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:52,900
So...

96
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,020
So...

97
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,180
Um...

98
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,680
Recap.

99
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,540
We...

100
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,780
Okay, recap, recap.

101
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,840
Um, a lot happened.

102
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,120
Um, we found out that the daughter that was kidnapped was
not the minister's daughter.

103
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,820
Instead, it was Detective Jowd's daughter.

104
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:20,000
Uh, Camilla is Detective Jowd's daughter and that she built
a contraption that is eerily similar to the one in that

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,600
pigeon guy's junkyard basement.

106
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,540
And, uh, the same one that killed...

107
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,780
in before and blue guy voice.

108
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,340
Oh, cutie.

109
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,960
No, I don't want to be him.

110
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,080
I don't want to hear his voice.

111
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,200
And stop super chatting.

112
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,140
How, what do you think about me?

113
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,120
Stop it.

114
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,340
Um, yeah, we hate that guy now.

115
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,560
We hate Shaggy now.

116
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,200
Um.

117
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:02,420
Um, because uh, Then we were told to get the music box
because the music box has the gun in it.

118
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,900
We get the music box and we figure out that the other guy
died because Missile...

119
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,760
Oh, Missile, Missile died.

120
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,920
But Missile now has powers!

121
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,820
Missile has special powers because of some sort of
meteorite, maybe?

122
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,900
Some strange meteorite fell in the park and...

123
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,120
that was holding Lin hostage?

124
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,300
Oh.

125
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:32,700
Um.

126
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,330
And yeah.

127
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,230
This will better.

128
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,970
This will better survive this or I'm going to riot.

129
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,670
So continue.

130
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,350
But yeah.

131
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,830
I believe that's everything that happened.

132
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,010
Anime nonsense.

133
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,850
Got it.

134
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:52,590
Yeah.

135
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,330
The Temsik.

136
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:59,250
The Temsik fell in the park and...

137
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,370
became Temsik Park.

138
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,110
And that's why the guy was trying to not have people build
in the park.

139
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,030
So Sara fell asleep before the last two streams, so I'm
forcing myself to stay awake.

140
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:10,350
No!

141
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,730
Don't force yourself!

142
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,110
Terushin!

143
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:14,710
No!

144
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:21,330
I have a... I plan on having a EU-friendly stream at the end
of this week, on Friday.

145
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,490
So, um...

146
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,970
You can watch that!

147
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:26,370
Mmm.

148
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,690
She's our Kami-oshi ghost from an inn.

149
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,390
Thank you.

150
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:34,970
Thank you.

151
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:37,890
But yeah.

152
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,390
The meteorite fell 10 years ago, though.

153
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,630
Which is still weird.

154
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:43,930
Why is that weird?

155
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,170
Are meteorites on a timeline?

156
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,130
Are they on a deadline?

157
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,260
But yeah.

158
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,120
Oh yeah, and apparently that's the biggest thing.

159
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:58,560
You're right.

160
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,380
Apparently Cicel was the kidnapper.

161
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,680
in the park 10 years ago.

162
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,860
Which makes no sense.

163
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,120
There's so much that we have to learn about.

164
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,400
So let's...

165
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,620
Let's get to it!

166
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,120
Let's just jump right into it.

167
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,340
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited to beat the game.

168
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,080
255 a.m.

169
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,460
I would be passed out at this point.

170
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,100
That was a really wild twist.

171
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:32,060
10 years ago, a man named Sissel took a little girl named
Lynn hostage and then was killed by a meteor right fragment.

172
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,880
But, didn't Detective Jout say that the guy's name was not
Cicil?

173
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,420
Thank you for yapping.

174
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,720
I got stuck in traffic.

175
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,780
I almost didn't make it, so I'm hyped.

176
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,160
Let's go Saku!

177
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
Welcome home!

178
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,540
O'Kairi, nasaimasei!

179
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,700
Niels, thank you for the prank!

180
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,820
No, no one has said that today.

181
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,360
I don't think anybody will say it today.

182
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,050
Anyway.

183
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:21,730
And then we're was killed by a meteorite fragment mint
fragment I I killed a man tonight a man named Cecil met a

184
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:27,810
detective named Lynn at a junkyard on the edge of town and
then was killed by a bullet oh one other thing I forgot to

185
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:35,990
mention we forgot the the manipulator there's like some

What?

190
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,730
What's wrong?

191
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,270
Why are you guys doing the Tehapero?

192
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:58,730
Nice say it.

193
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,750
What do you mean, liquid?

194
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,050
Oh, liquid and solid sizzle?

195
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,170
I hope so.

196
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,250
Here's to our Oshi's missile.

197
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,250
And Minto, too.

198
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,490
Thank you.

199
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,010
Oh, my oh, she is also Missal.

200
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:21,070
Yeah.

201
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:22,930
Okay.

202
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,270
Okay.

203
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,350
Okay.

204
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:33,950
Tonight, a man named Sisal met a detective named Lynn at a
junkyard on the edge of town and then was killed by a

205
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,230
bullet.

206
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:38,450
And we think that maybe the manipulator, well, we don't
think.

207
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:46,430
We think that the manipulator manipulated the gun to kill
the mom instead of the contraption working as it was

208
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,130
supposed to.

209
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:54,030
that maybe we think that the manipulator possessed Lynn to
shoot Cicel.

210
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:55,890
Mezzo!

211
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,170
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

212
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,190
And Smash Boo!

213
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,010
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

214
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,350
Why are you guys gifting so many gifted memberships today?

215
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,650
Why is going on?

216
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:15,650
But the scene I was waiting for me on the other end of the
phone line feels like the final nail in the coffin of my

217
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,450
lost memory.

218
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,150
Okay.

219
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,570
Oh, wait.

220
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:19,950
Oh, and that's right!

221
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,330
What is going on?

222
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,310
You're a suit.

223
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:25,150
Huh?

224
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:26,590
Wait.

225
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,850
What?

226
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,090
What?

227
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:32,410
What?

228
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:37,980
YouTube chat.

229
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,680
Sorry, people are talking about how cute Mincus is.

230
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,200
Some people say that she is extra cute today.

231
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,080
Well, others say that she is always cute.

232
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,760
I hate this.

233
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:46,880
I hate this.

234
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:47,840
Wait.

235
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,680
I see myself.

236
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,940
Cicilification, maybe.

237
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,100
What is going on?

238
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,100
What is going on?

239
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,060
Guffle thinks you're the gifted.

240
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,760
Primax thinks you're the gifted.

241
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,780
Niels thinks you're the tech gifted.

242
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,780
C2, thanks for the five gifted.

243
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,380
Oh my gosh.

244
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,120
This is the peak.

245
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh, wait.

246
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,840
Okay, wait.

247
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,180
Also, because...

248
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,480
Also, because...

249
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,980
Also, because...

250
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,580
Detective Carbonara also betrayed us.

251
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,380
He said the...

252
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,900
You gotta kill Detective Jowd or something.

253
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,740
By tonight, he said the deal still stands.

254
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,600
He betrayed us, I think.

255
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,200
What is going on?

256
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,760
Who are you?

257
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,720
Liquid!

258
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:39,320
Huh?

259
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:40,680
Oh.

260
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,860
There you are, Commander Sith.

261
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:46,980
Huh?

262
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,400
Cicel.

263
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,040
What?

264
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,060
Where have you been, my good man?

265
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,520
We've been looking everywhere for you.

266
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,140
What?

267
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,120
Had a little unfinished business to take care of.

268
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,740
Didn't think it would take this long.

269
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,480
What about your people?

270
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,160
They sure went out of their way to mess me up.

271
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,220
How are there three of us?

272
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,160
Thanks for playing through one of my favorite games.

273
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,760
It's the first time I watched a streamer play through an
entire game from start to finish.

274
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,700
It's been kind of poggers.

275
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,900
I hope you enjoy the finale.

276
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,520
Oh my gosh, thank you!

277
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,340
I believe we fulfilled every one of your conditions in our
little deal.

278
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,940
Oh my gosh, thank you guys.

279
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,380
Minto, Minto.

280
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,500
Can you say purple burglar alarm?

281
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,910
Did I say something bad just now?

282
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,170
I don't know.

283
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,390
What right do you have to complain about anything outside
our bargain?

284
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,010
It's a tongue twister.

285
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,490
Oh, okay.

286
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,210
We can talk about that when we get together.

287
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,850
This will be our last communication by telephone.

288
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,810
We'll arrive in one hour.

289
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,770
I look forward to seeing you, Sissel.

290
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,730
What?

291
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,310
How do you know me?

292
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,230
How, how do I, how am I know me?

293
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,750
How am I standing, no, how am I there?

294
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,870
Dawn is approaching.

295
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:24,990
The darkness surrounding my own mystery is deep, but I know
it's always darkest before the dawn.

296
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,750
Did I convince myself I'm Sissel, but I'm not actually
Sissel?

297
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:29,830
Huh?

298
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,170
Solid, am I solid, Sissel?

299
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,690
Wait, that, no, that is not solid Sissel.

300
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:45,470
Hmm, yes, we're nearing the final stages of our little deal,
my good man.

301
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:46,870
Yes, sir.

302
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,710
All preparations are complete, sir.

303
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,730
And we just had a report, sir.

304
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,230
Lights have been spotted, sir.

305
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:53,230
Lights?

306
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,470
Have they now?

307
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,410
By all means, let me have a look.

308
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,790
My voice being raspy, today is perfect for this guy.

309
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,810
Oh my gosh, we haven't seen these guys since the very
beginning.

310
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:14,130
beginning and we're on part five always there two there are
a master and an apprentice whoa that's a Star Wars reference

314
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,340

316
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,460
Inspector Cabanella.

317
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,320
But you could never stop me.

318
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,480
Oh my gosh, he's got an evil look on his face.

319
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,820
Oh my god, what is going on?

320
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,280
Huh.

321
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:23,480
He is.

322
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,260
He is pretty.

323
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,460
He is pretty alright.

324
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,860
See you, sucker.

325
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,440
Oh my gosh, evil Cecil.

326
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:37,900
Solitus.

327
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,340
Cecil.

328
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,820
Oh my god, wait, now we get to talk to Inspector.

329
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,760
So, that submarine guy and his people have a deal going with
me, do they?

330
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,680
If that's the case, they probably aren't the ones...

331
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,900
Sorry, the ones that killed me, right?

332
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,460
Anyway, there's definitely something behind the Inspector's
death.

333
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,200
I think I'd better talk to him.

334
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,260
Where did you get that information from?

335
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,670
Oh, he's unconscious.

336
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,630
Hey, do you think you go away?

337
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,390
wake up for me?

338
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,130
Wake up!

339
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,050
Oh boy, still unconscious, eh?

340
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,690
I guess he hasn't been dead for very long, then.

341
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,170
See you later, alligator.

342
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,870
Thanks, Angel!

343
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,530
Thanks for the gifting!

344
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,110
I'll just go ahead and go back to four minutes before his
death.

345
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,650
I'm a little nervous about what I might see there, though.

346
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,730
But if that's where I was...

347
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,970
I'm gonna find my answers.

348
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,930
Oh my gosh, I can't stop yawning!

349
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,230
I can't run away from it.

350
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,630
I may need to go get some tea or something.

351
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,480
Once the criminal gets the punishment he deserves, the
hostage will go free.

352
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,460
Carry out the execution immediately and wait for our call.

353
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,620
Okay, this is what we saw.

354
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,360
Okay.

355
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,740
Wow.

356
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,920
That's a good boy.

357
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,180
Gee.

358
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,980
It sure is a handy thing.

359
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:33,180
It gives me complete control over the top police inspector
in the country.

360
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,580
So, Detective Cabanela isn't betraying us.

361
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,240
His son.

362
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,380
What's the matter?

363
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,260
Why do we have an accent all of a sudden?

364
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,460
What's the matter?

365
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,920
All those broken bones, smart of it?

366
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,380
He broke his bones.

367
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,040
to feel pain.

368
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,540
Does it make you feel alive?

369
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,880
Wait, the sizzle is dead?

370
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,380
Why are you doing this?

371
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,240
Now, is that any kind of question for a top inspector to
ask?

372
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,700
Isn't it obvious?

373
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,040
Revenge, of course.

374
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,460
Oh my god!

375
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,400
Revenge on all the people who stole my life away 10 years
ago.

376
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,760
Make me feel alive again.

377
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,320
So he's...

378
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:27,700
Wait.

379
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,460
Is he possessing my body or...

380
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,910
So wait, we died.

381
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,530
I'm guessing.

382
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:41,650
I'm guessing we died and then the ghost possessed our body.

383
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:43,790
I'm guessing.

384
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,550
I'm guessing.

385
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,730
The manipulator.

386
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,030
Don't be ridiculous.

387
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,390
It was a meteorite that stole your life.

388
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,850
Or have you forgotten that?

389
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,290
Wait, but then that still doesn't explain 10 years ago.

390
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:11,630
wrong I was murdered by all of you oh my goodness my throat
maybe has multiple lives like a cat maybe detective Jowd who

391
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:17,550
chased me down and forced me into a corner even though I was
innocent Lynn that girl who was right there where I was

392
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:27,170
running we were blaming the child Lynn she was just an
innocent little girl playing in the park don't push yourself

393
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,190
I'll be okay, no worries.

394
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,810
If that brat hadn't been there, I never would have thought
of taking a hostage.

395
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,750
That's the most self-centered garbage I've ever heard.

396
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,770
And finally you, Inspector Cabanella.

397
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,210
Me.

398
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:52,450
If you hadn't done what you did, I never would have pointed
a gun at that kid.

399
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,810
Wait, what did he do?

400
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,650
This is a whole lot of victim-blaming, Sissel.

401
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:06,410
You were so proud of your spotless record, and my case was
the one blot on it, wasn't it?

402
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,270
Only two people know the real truth.

403
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,350
Me and Detective Jowd.

404
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,910
I bet tonight's execution will be quite a relief to you,
won't it?

405
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,650
One of the people who know about the stain on your record
will disappear for good.

406
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,930
That's why you didn't help him escape from prison.

407
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,190
Pshowd.

408
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:39,190
objection that's the kind of guy you are hmm I

409
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:46,220
got nothing to say to you you'd never listen anyway

410
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:20,850
you got now then inspector time to make a big red stain on
your spotless white coat what the oh my god he's

411
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,070
manipulating Everything!

412
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,270
He's too powerful!

413
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,490
This was another condition of my ideal.

414
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:32,330
To wipe out everybody who knew about Temsec.

415
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,070
Wait, what?

416
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,630
Then what about the old man?

417
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,070
Revenge?

418
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,410
That's what I'm up to!

419
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,610
None of this makes any sense.

420
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,430
Hey, man!

421
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,150
He's alive!

422
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,690
Mind telling me what's going on?

423
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,210
Inspector Cabanela, he's awake!

424
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,670
My head is spinning, baby.

425
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,550
Am I to understand?

426
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,010
That Cabanela character who just got shot is me?

427
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,630
Uh, that's right.

428
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:14,050
And you're supposed to be the scoundrel there who just shot
me?

429
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,890
I guess so.

430
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,790
But you couldn't be, could you?

431
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,330
Huh?

432
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,450
After all, the guy in the red suit just walked out the door.

433
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:42,610
right so who are you I don't know I don't know I guess I
just have to face it I'm not that sizzle guy I'm somebody

434
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:52,590
who's searching for himself oh poor guy what do you mean low
battery uh-oh

435
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:03,350
is it not charging

436
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,600
Uh oh.

437
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,640
Uh oh.

438
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,960
Oh wait, one second, let me try this.

439
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,250
Oh that doesn't work.

440
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,230
Uh oh.

441
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,050
Let me try this.

442
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,310
Oh wait.

443
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:57,030
Um.

444
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,750
Ah!

445
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,370
Um.

446
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,150
I'm trying to charge my controller.

447
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,090
I cannot use the Joy-Cons.

448
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,370
No, I cannot do that.

449
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,170
Oh,

450
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:29,790
shoot.

451
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:32,890
I mean, maybe.

452
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,730
Actually, let me see.

453
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:49,820
No.

454
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,600
See, you can hear them?

455
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,820
Can you hear them?

456
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,380
I'm pressing the arrow.

457
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,100
a button, but it's not doing anything.

458
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,800
Why isn't it charging?

459
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,080
It's worked before.

460
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,800
Hold on.

461
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,320
Let me try plugging it in again.

462
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,960
I'll try it in again.

463
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,040
I think I didn't have it plugged in all the way.

464
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,730
Or it wasn't plugged in all the way.

465
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:49,510
Okay, now we're good.

466
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,410
I'm so sorry, everybody.

467
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:50,930
I'm so sorry.

468
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:51,750
Okay, we're good now.

469
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:52,030
We're good.

470
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,390
The light is on.

471
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:55,870
Okay.

472
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:07,510
he was searching for himself okay here we go shut up shut up
everybody that's why i'm here to save you at the very least

473
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:21,390
you have information about that guy in red information i
need i'm not a clown stop no i'm not a clown so you came on

474
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:28,090
a rescue mission now did you nothing like the sound of that
baby because there's a very important life here somewhere.

475
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,490
A life valuable to this nation.

476
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,710
I get it, she's cute as ever, but extra silly.

477
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:38,550
Colonel!

478
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,290
Sissel, turn the game console off right now!

479
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:46,070
Were you manipulating my... my controller?

480
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:47,850
Okay.

481
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,850
Do your thing, baby.

482
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,750
Alright, four minutes before the death.

483
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,370
Okay, trick time.

484
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,570
So are you a manipulator too?

485
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,410
Oh, he knows what a manipulator is.

486
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,330
Why do we not know anything then?

487
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:18,450
Why do we not know anything about, like, you know, I think
that's kind of odd.

488
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,210
Like, everyone else kind of regains a little bit of their
memory.

489
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,110
Like, not a memory, but, like, a little bit of knowledge.

490
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,030
We didn't even know what kidnapping was.

491
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:32,610
You know?

492
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:37,570
How does Inspector Cabanela know what manipulator is and all
that research and everything?

493
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,990
He didn't know his name, but he kept everything that he
knew.

494
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,930
For us, we don't know anything.

495
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,700
My man even forgot how to read.

496
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,520
Yeah, we don't even know how to read.

497
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,920
We don't even know how to read.

498
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:03,700
Hmm.

499
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,980
There's something fishy here.

500
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:14,720
Like, like it doesn't feel like we were human is what I'm
getting at.

501
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,380
I don't know.

502
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,040
No spoilers, no spoilers.

503
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,680
I'm just cooking.

504
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,360
I'm just cooking.

505
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,140
I have ghost tricks.

506
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,340
Powers of the dead, yeah, but I can't control living
creatures.

507
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,800
Anywho, I think you'd better be very careful.

508
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,140
A guy in red is a manipulator.

509
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,160
Naturally, he knows about powers like yours.

510
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:34,900
Oh!

511
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,260
Wait, so if I change something, is he going to...

512
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,020
If he realizes you're here, things might get a little
sticky.

513
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:44,940
You're right.

514
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,980
I'd better be careful.

515
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,380
That's a good boy.

516
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,680
That's a good boy.

517
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,580
Hello, ghosty hello.

518
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,820
Hope you're doing well today.

519
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,400
Thank you.

520
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,380
Thank you so much.

521
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,740
Thanks for the don't know.

522
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,480
We've, okay, we've kind of gotten all this part.

523
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:08,580
Let's see.

524
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,820
What can we...

525
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,800
Oh, look at him!

526
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,020
There's that something emanating from his body.

527
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,700
Is it really the sign of having special powers of the dead?

528
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,200
Okay.

529
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,340
Helmet.

530
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,900
Oh, we can get up to the book.

531
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,100
What is this?

532
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,800
The top of this bookshelf is lined with books.

533
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,940
This one is the top is balanced so precariously, it's a
wonder if it doesn't fall off.

534
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,100
old pigeon guy even reach up here.

535
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,640
And I wonder if he makes his pigeon fetch it for him.

536
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,440
The stink?

537
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,280
Nasty.

538
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,520
Nasty.

539
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,280
Okay.

540
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,120
What can we do with the helmet?

541
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,400
We can rock it.

542
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,440
Oh!

543
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:56,920
Uh-oh.

544
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,080
I think he noticed us.

545
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:58,400
Ah!

546
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,600
What's going on?

547
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,540
We've never seen the ghost world like this!

548
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,800
So you're here, are you?

549
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,920
He sensed my presence!

550
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:12,680
Uh-oh.

551
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,370
Me?

552
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,410
Wait a minute.

553
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:21,010
Me?

554
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,670
I notice you.

555
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,450
You think you can stop me, do you?

556
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,170
Oh my god.

557
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,170
He's looking at me!

558
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,630
I don't know why you're wearing my face.

559
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,310
But you might as well give up now.

560
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,690
I control everything.

561
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:37,610
Damn it.

562
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,530
No, it doesn't work!

563
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,410
It doesn't work!

564
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:44,370
Everything, including the life of this police inspector and
what?

565
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,030
Wait, don't shoot!

566
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,370
Oh my god.

567
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,350
So we can't make any obvious movements.

568
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,190
That's crazy.

569
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:04,170
This other me knows the powers of the dead well.

570
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,630
Who wouldn't notice what you just did?

571
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,930
You were practically shouting, look at me, baby.

572
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,670
It looks like it might be hard to save you under these
circumstances.

573
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:17,490
I guess I can't use my powers right in front of him like
that.

574
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:19,850
Interesting.

575
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:23,390
I was curious what would happen if he noticed us.

576
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,510
So interesting.

577
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:26,490
So cool.

578
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:27,650
Okay.

579
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,870
Oh my god he looked straight at me.

580
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:30,750
It's kind of freaky.

581
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:38,690
Not saying I would do this but are we allowed to gift you
weapons?

582
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,670
Like are we allowed to give you weapons?

583
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:56,890
maybe a sword um no as much as i would love to accept that i
don't think i can um

584
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:16,390
but also if this is for off kai after off kai i'm going to
japan so um i would like the gifts to be smaller so that I

585
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:22,830
can fit them in my suitcase yeah there and back yeah

586
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:37,520
oh my gosh I would be that would be awesome to get a sword
though that'd be so cool wait there's I if I open this will

587
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:44,800
the same thing happen or close it oh okay we gotta wait for
it to heat up, I think.

588
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
And go...

589
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,090
What's the matter?

590
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,850
Oh, those broken bones smart a bit.

591
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,670
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

592
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,170
Oh!

593
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,430
Never mind.

594
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:01,870
Okay.

595
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:05,090
He didn't even give us time to...

596
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,510
Oh, but now we're closer here.

597
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,210
Okay, perfect.

598
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:09,830
And...

599
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,490
Oh!

600
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,090
Wait, everything's destroyed!

601
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:14,670
What about a...

602
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,150
calm.

603
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,510
I won it!

604
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:20,790
PSA, do not give weapons to the dangerous VTuber.

605
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,430
It's not for my safety, it's for yours.

606
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,970
Look at this place.

607
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,910
The whole thing, the whole contraption is destroyed!

608
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,310
Is the old man dead?

609
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,070
What in the world happened here?

610
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,550
I think I'm starting to remember.

611
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:54,150
bad happened here and now there's another death lion lying
hidden here i knew it what another death didn't i tell you

612
00:38:54,150 --> 00:39:00,730
from the start didn't i say there was a very important life
value valuable to the nation here he wasn't talking about

613
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:15,520
himself i thought you were talking about you i'm just a
crazy character and a white coat baby oh his little bird is

614
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,500
sad Okay, come to think of it.

615
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,580
Where is that old pigeon guy?

616
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,740
Okay, we don't have much time.

617
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,740
Move it down.

618
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,660
Or...

619
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,160
Oh, like that, exactly.

620
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,360
There he is!

621
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,820
Oh, little bird.

622
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,240
Little bird.

623
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,160
This is some kind of a device.

624
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,300
Very astute observation.

625
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,500
Sorry, my memory isn't working.

626
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,500
and working too well right now either.

627
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,300
But I do remember seeing somebody use this equipment,
though.

628
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,700
I gotta open this thing.

629
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,340
Yeah, there we go.

630
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,880
So sad.

631
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,720
It's too sad.

632
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,780
It's too sad.

633
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,140
Okay, let's talk to the doctor.

634
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,780
Let me excuse me.

635
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:14,990
Are you awake?

636
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:21,950
Of course.

637
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,370
I never sleep during work hours.

638
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,130
Professor, do you recognize me?

639
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,730
There's only one crazy character in a white coat that I know
of.

640
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,210
He hasn't lost his memory.

641
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,770
I'm not the type who likes losing things.

642
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,690
But never mind that.

643
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,930
Cabanella, this is quite a surprising guest you've brought
with you.

644
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,710
Pretending like he didn't just blow up the place.

645
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:47,530
Oh, shoot.

646
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,670
We're trying to hide the evidence.

647
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:52,910
Are you talking about me?

648
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,110
Well, this is a different guy.

649
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,630
And I'm his guest, actually.

650
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,510
Said he came to rescue us.

651
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,270
Why is the bird there, too?

652
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,450
The bird is always with him in spirit.

653
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:11,990
Unlike you, my sharp friend, he still hasn't gotten his
memory back.

654
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:13,750
Hmph.

655
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,230
Pitiful.

656
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:15,850
Ouch.

657
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:16,710
That hurts.

658
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:20,850
Anyway, now we'll be going back to four minutes before your
death.

659
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,050
In order to change your fate, that is.

660
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:26,170
But aren't we already in the past, man?

661
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,590
But we can go back even further!

662
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:30,890
I've done it before.

663
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,490
I still don't see a path to saving Inspector Cabanella.

664
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,890
But if we go back further, maybe I'll find a lead.

665
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,210
Okay.

666
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:39,250
Oh my gosh.

667
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,970
We're rewinding even further!

668
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,590
Going beyond!

669
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:49,270
Okay.

670
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:50,450
Ghostception.

671
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:52,930
What the?

672
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,590
How many times do I have to tell you, Professor?

673
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,130
This place is dangerous.

674
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,220
Ugh.

675
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,240
Don't be daft.

676
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,660
I can't leave now.

677
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,360
Wait, what is he doing with Cicil's body?

678
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,200
He's completely dead.

679
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,940
But just as I thought, I'm getting a reading.

680
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,940
This is the source of his powers.

681
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,780
If I remove it...

682
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,840
He's not dead.

683
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,620
He's just not there.

684
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,820
Wait, what do you mean?

685
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,920
What do you mean by that?

686
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,100
The true form of the manipulator isn't something you can
detect.

687
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,200
It's a spirit!

688
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,120
Hmm, ridiculous.

689
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,700
So you figured it all out, huh?

690
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,740
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,
dun, dun.

691
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,980
Hold on, I have a cool effect.

692
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,000
I have a cool effect for Evil Sissel.

693
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,040
You're a clever man, Inspector Cabanella.

694
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,260
So it's really true.

695
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,400
You're...

696
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,260
I wasted a lot of time tonight because of you, Inspector.

697
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,040
Spooky.

698
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,400
But it's all just like you said.

699
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:46,440
died 10 years ago this body is just a vessel a shell i
control everything the shell people just like i controlled

700
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,160
the justice minister and lynn

701
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,140
evil mint hot wait a second

702
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:09,620
so it's true you were manipulating my baby that time you
made her shoot your shell but why why would you do a thing

703
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:21,060
like that to create conclusive evidence you know on that
security tape now she's a murderer too she'll suffer just

704
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:35,040
like Zhao did go back I have to I have to do it for the
character you guys now then professor but imagine you guys

705
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:45,660

think I'd be able to get it right now thank you I can't if I

00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,320
put on an eye patch I would be just like riding

707
00:44:53,500 --> 00:45:04,620
able mint kawaii I'm afraid it's time for you to die I don't
have any grudge against you.

708
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,780
I'm even grateful to you.

709
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:07,660
Doctor!

710
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,600
Oh, yeah.

711
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,740
So why don't you let me live then?

712
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,480
I'll be leaving this country forever tonight.

713
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:23,080
But before I do, I need to erase all evidence that these
powers of mine exist.

714
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,080
Along with the contraption in this room.

715
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:31,620
Oh my god.

716
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,140
Oh my god.

717
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:32,720
Oh my god.

718
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,200
Wait!

719
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:42,300
bomb the bomb the bomb the bomb the bomb wait who this time
the thing will work the way it was meant to and it'll be

720
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:53,540
it'll be all over wait but like why don't you just like all
you have to do is like use your finger and go on the on the

721
00:45:53,540 --> 00:46:00,800
fire and then it's fixed evil mint please come crawling out
of my computer Okay.

722
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,480
Cupid won't turn this time.

723
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,300
He'll shoot his little arrow this way.

724
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,930
Professor look out!

725
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:20,690
Wait, how did he know that there was a bomb there?

726
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:24,570
How did he survive that?

727
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:28,570
Dynamite, eh?

728
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:30,810
When the devil did he put that there?

729
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:31,830
That's what I'm saying!

730
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,960
He planned it all out tonight.

731
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:51,560
my baby shoot him having his corpse disappear his corpse
disappeared wait 10 years ago no oh yeah when we were

732
00:46:51,560 --> 00:47:01,800
sitting there right that medical examiner remember him he
was a complete and utter impasse i i said it i called it i

733
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,930
called guy is probably in kahoot's with them i

734
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,440
i called it i called it

735
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,420
i mean maybe i I was being a little judgmental.

736
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,620
But, um.

737
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,380
I don't know.

738
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,680
He said he was going to take the corpse back to the lab.

739
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,640
But he'd already made a deal.

740
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,640
But he also was acting kind of sussy, you know.

741
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,100
He already made a deal with the manipulator to meet him and
give him the body back.

742
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,980
But I wasn't going to let that happen, baby.

743
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,200
You saw through their play.

744
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:08,400
I noticed right away the medical examiner didn't know the
first thing about examining a body he was being weird I knew

745
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:17,620
he was a fake so I tracked him down and bought him off oh my
god dang he's a he's a triple crosser bought him off I had

746
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:26,180
him smuggle the corpse to this room oh I thought we could
find the source of his powers.

747
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,660
Of course, never in my wildest dreams did I think his
abilities were powers of the dead.

748
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:32,740
Hmm.

749
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,580
Anyway, there isn't much time.

750
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,700
He's leaving the country before dawn.

751
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,400
That's why I have until dawn, probably.

752
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,440
And I'm gonna follow him, of course, after I save you two.

753
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,620
But something's been nagging at the back of my mind.

754
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,280
I remember what Ray said to me tonight.

755
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:54,140
He said that spirits cease to exist when the day breaks.

756
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:00,620
But if that's true, how could a spirit from 10 years ago
still be here?

757
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,640
Cabanela is Ocelot?

758
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:05,440
No!

759
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,160
The doctor is Ocelot.

760
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,960
The doctor is Ocelot.

761
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,060
Except he's like, so inconsequential.

762
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,480
Yeah, I think Ray was lying.

763
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,380
I think I mentioned that last stream too.

764
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,260
No time for thinking now, baby.

765
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,120
Action is the name of the game.

766
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:30,980
Work your magic and take us back even further into the past.

767
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:35,460
Hmm.

768
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:38,440
Okay.

769
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,140
If only...

770
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,460
If only they had...

771
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:45,620
Oh.

772
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:46,340
Oh, sorry.

773
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,220
I didn't realize.

774
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,480
I thought I pressed Cabanilla's text.

775
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,660
He said, stop the explosion.

776
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,920
Foolish of you to say, too.

777
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,700
If you stop the explosion, just do me in some other way.

778
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:58,980
Fair enough.

779
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,500
Then jump in there and take care of that man in red, would
you?

780
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,160
I repeat, easy enough for you to say.

781
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,500
And most likely impossible to boot.

782
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,360
That huge explosion didn't even make him bat an eye.

783
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,740
We gotta tie him up.

784
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,020
Well, what do you propose then, Professor?

785
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,040
Pray tell.

786
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:22,620
Your best bet is to save me during the explosion without him
noticing.

787
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,160
How is that our best bet?

788
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:36,160
bet this puzzle is tough to figure out how how how how is
that our best bet why don't we just tie him up and not let

789
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:46,080
him touch anything easy enough for you to say sheesh what's
with all these people any who jump in there and do something

790
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:58,200
okay okay my guess is when the explosion happens we open up
the door and have him fall down.

791
00:50:59,280 --> 00:50:59,280
Right?

792
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,340
So that way he wouldn't notice that

793
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:10,570
that way he wouldn't notice that he doesn't die.

794
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:14,590
But I also can't move anywhere.

795
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:16,170
Oh wait, here we go.

796
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:17,110
Okay.

797
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:22,610
Fool, what do you think you're doing?

798
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:24,770
Oh, I just thought I'd try it out.

799
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:28,170
If you do, you're going to set the contraption in motion.

800
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:29,830
Just put the fire out.

801
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:32,790
Oh yeah, I just thought.

802
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,150
He just thought he'd blow me up is what he thought.

803
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:38,210
Oops, that was my bad.

804
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:43,170
There aren't a whole lot of things I can use my tricks on in
this room.

805
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:46,950
Yeah, exactly.

806
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:50,710
Uh...

807
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:53,090
Why don't you just set the...

808
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:55,410
You can move the fire away!

809
00:51:58,630 --> 00:51:59,950
I need him to move back.

810
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:00,930
towards me.

811
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:05,760
Can you turn this way, sir?

812
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:07,840
I can't reach.

813
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:09,840
Oh, maybe here?

814
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:10,640
There we go.

815
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:10,980
Okay.

816
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,760
Do I have to wait?

817
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,600
No, I feel like it has to be something else that I can do.

818
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,280
I'm gonna see what happens if I go all the way until the end
and drop him down, right?

819
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,940
Oh, but he doesn't...

820
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:34,720
S...

821
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:35,520
stand.

822
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:36,600
Oh, there.

823
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,020
Okay, now he does stand on the door.

824
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,700
Okay, nice.

825
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,420
Time is passing.

826
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:44,720
What if I drop a note?

827
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,880
Oh, it's no use.

828
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,280
I can't.

829
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,780
Oh, I can't.

830
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,280
The fact that Professor is standing on it, have anything to
do with it?

831
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,420
I may look small, but I'm pretty heavy set.

832
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,820
He sounds so proud of that fact, too.

833
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,020
This door, such a pity.

834
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,100
Too bad it doesn't open downward.

835
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,660
Sometimes life can be so hard.

836
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,700
No, that's why we're both dead.

837
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,620
A door that opens downward, eh?

838
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,700
A door that opens downward?

839
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:15,660
What is going on in here?

840
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,560
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

841
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,770
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum.

842
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:30,650
As you perhaps may have already noticed, time is running
out, baby.

843
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,350
Yeah, know perhaps about it.

844
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:34,830
I know.

845
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:38,610
But you know, there aren't a whole lot of things and use my
ghost tricks on in here.

846
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:40,270
Looks like it's all over.

847
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,670
Unless I find another path, I'm sort of out of deadlock
here.

848
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:45,430
Sizzle.

849
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:46,850
Who is this?

850
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:47,230
Sizzle.

851
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:49,250
I know that voice.

852
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:52,010
Help me.

853
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:55,990
Where are you?

854
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:58,310
Find me.

855
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:01,690
Before I'm carried away.

856
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:07,150
What's with that frail sounding call for help?

857
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:10,530
He's here somewhere!

858
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:13,910
Is it Ray?

859
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:15,470
The lamp?

860
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:16,250
Missile?

861
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:18,830
Oh, it's a missile!

862
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:22,750
A little guy that looks a little fragile but has strength
that surprise you!

863
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,270
Well, he's asking you to find him!

864
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:27,770
And before, he's carried away, no less.

865
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:29,730
But I'm almost out of time.

866
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:30,690
Should I look for him?

867
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:32,910
Okay, uh...

868
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:34,090
I can't reach!

869
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:37,610
Oh no!

870
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:38,130
Wait!

871
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:39,130
Um,

872
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:02,180
if I can stop this toy from spinning, I can halt the
contraption without really solving anything.

873
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,500
There is a smart boy.

874
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:06,040
If you stop the explosion, they'll find another way to get
me.

875
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:07,540
It would probably give you the...

876
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,920
Give away the fact that you're here too.

877
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,600
So I have to rescue you without stopping the explosion.

878
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:12,980
Is that even possible?

879
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,920
That's what has to be done.

880
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,080
Deal with it.

881
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,380
Can I reach?

882
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,280
I can't reach!

883
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,020
How do I...

884
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,200
Do I just look around?

885
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,200
Oh!

886
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,120
Cecil!

887
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,760
Here I am!

888
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:39,960
It's Meso!

889
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,840
What are you doing there?

890
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,900
Do you really have to ask?

891
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,200
Seriously, are you really going there?

892
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,280
Uh, no, that's okay.

893
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,040
Never mind.

894
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,100
Anyway, I need your powers.

895
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,180
Will you help me out?

896
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:53,760
Of course!

897
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,160
Here, let me come join you!

898
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,160
Um...

899
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,000
Okay.

900
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:04,780
Very good.

901
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:06,560
Here I am, sisal.

902
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:09,200
Wait, but I think I've lost too much time, I think.

903
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,420
Wait, no.

904
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,040
We just have to figure out before...

905
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,440
As the explosion happens, so...

906
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,160
We have to figure it out as the explosion happens.

907
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,000
Maybe things will flow in a new direction.

908
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,520
Even though the flow of the sewer is a little bit stinky.

909
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,440
Fate has changed.

910
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,200
Kind of.

911
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,300
Okay.

912
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,860
All right, let's see.

913
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,160
YZR.

914
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,100
What are some things that are the same?

915
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:49,080
Measuring device, toolbox, motor.

916
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,880
Is there anything that's like the same shape?

917
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,660
Thanks for the super chat!

918
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,880
The toy cake.

919
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,760
It's kind of similar to the tool.

920
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,460
Oh, well, you can't reach that floor, though.

921
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,180
Okay, hold on.

922
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:15,800
Maybe...

923
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,380
No, no, no.

924
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:17,580
Maybe down here.

925
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:18,780
Oh, wait.

926
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,260
Actually, what about the rats?

927
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:21,840
Here, here, here.

928
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,580
Trash can lid.

929
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,180
Trash can.

930
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:27,760
What's this?

931
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,260
What was going on?

932
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,840
Those squeaky guys are making a fuss about something.

933
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:33,300
Cicel.

934
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,380
My animal instincts are starting to thwart.

935
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:40,700
If you mean you want to chase them, I think you have to be
alive to do that.

936
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:41,740
Hmm.

937
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,280
There must be some kind of rat feast in that trash can.

938
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,120
Those things usually make a bigger commotion than that.

939
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:49,920
Bigger commotion, eh?

940
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:52,860
What does that mean?

941
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,180
Oh!

942
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:58,840
Swap.

943
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,780
Okay, they're inside the feast.

944
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:05,760
What's in here?

945
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,580
What's going on?

946
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,180
Oh, more rats are coming!

947
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,840
Oh, what's going on?

948
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,660
Why are there so many rats?

949
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,340
Now that's what I'd call some proper commotion.

950
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,300
Why are there so many rats?

951
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,600
They're making that trash can dance.

952
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,100
Truth be told, I feel a bit like dancing now myself.

953
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:35,340
It's getting harder and harder to hold my wild instincts
back.

954
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,200
What a dangerous bunch.

955
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,640
Wait, I have like no time!

956
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:41,760
Oh, oh.

957
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,720
What's going on?

958
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,320
Trash can lid.

959
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:49,980
I don't know what I just did.

960
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:52,360
I don't... Wait, the trash can lid.

961
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:53,660
Oh no.

962
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,200
I thought the trash can lid and the tire could change.

963
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:15,580
Switch!

964
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,080
What does that do?

965
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,760
I have a trash can lid here now.

966
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:45,830
don't know what I don't know what else to do with it now
it's flat and we can switch it wait we can switch the lid

967
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:55,490
with ah oh okay okay I got I got it.

968
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:01,870
But we have to wait until it explodes, I think.

969
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:07,270
Oh my gosh, that's so tricky.

970
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:09,510
Okay.

971
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:11,730
Okay, okay.

972
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:17,390
I think if it explodes, it's too late.

973
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,310
You have zero seconds?

974
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:21,130
Okay, switch!

975
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:24,290
Look out!

976
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:26,550
Oh, there we go.

977
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:29,170
Okay!

978
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:34,970
Easy peasy.

979
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:35,830
Oh.

980
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:41,410
Cabanilla's not dead though.

981
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:42,590
He's not dead.

982
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:43,650
Sorry.

983
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:43,970
Oh.

984
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:46,670
Cah!

985
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:48,410
Sorry, little pigeon.

986
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:50,910
Oh my god.

987
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,430
Look at the, look at the position, the legging.

988
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:56,670
As for you, Inspector.

989
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:01,210
little job for you.

990
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:02,970
I can't move.

991
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:05,590
I think I have four or five broken bones.

992
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:07,650
I don't mind.

993
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:10,630
It won't prevent me from manipulating you.

994
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:15,610
It might make it hurt a little bit when I move you, though.

995
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:17,630
Quite a bit, actually.

996
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,310
Damn you!

997
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,180
No!

998
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:28,060
He's so cute.

999
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:28,740
Oh, wait.

1000
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:34,480
She's alive.

1001
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,880
First try, nice work.

1002
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:37,760
Thank you.

1003
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:39,840
I can't believe it.

1004
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:42,840
You lot actually pulled it off.

1005
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,900
Sorry, Inspector Cabanella.

1006
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,540
I couldn't do anything to help you.

1007
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:48,760
And there I am.

1008
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,280
A poor broken heap of arms and legs.

1009
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:53,860
But no matter.

1010
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,060
I enjoyed the shell.

1011
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,640
The magic disappearing act, that is.

1012
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,020
Nothing like it, baby.

1013
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,840
Yeah, his name's Lovidobby.

1014
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,220
No way, it's so cute.

1015
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,440
Do you guys mind if I have some...

1016
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:08,880
Pringles?

1017
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,520
I'm kind of hungry.

1018
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,780
I bought some Minecraft Pringles.

1019
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:16,480
So I can get coins.

1020
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:26,460
Except...

1021
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:27,980
Thank you, thank you.

1022
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:29,320
Chew.

1023
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:31,180
Richa, minto.

1024
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,100
With some help from the world's finest best doggle.

1025
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:34,860
Oh, sorry.

1026
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:35,860
The world's finest.

1027
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,620
The world's best doggle.

1028
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:38,720
Yes!

1029
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:55,390
I haven't had brinkles in so long, I got them because they
had minecraft on them.

1030
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:58,470
You get 350 minecoins!

1031
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:01,390
Who wouldn't get them?

1032
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:06,390
Unlike a normal magic trick, I'm the one that managed to
vanish without a trace here.

1033
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:08,670
Okay nice.

1034
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:15,210
You want some?

1035
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:17,310
Say ah!

1036
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,500
What do you do with minecoins?

1037
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:36,460
you can buy it's for the bedrock version not the Java
version you can buy certain worlds they have a Jurassic Park

aren't i'll just remember in the fact that right about now

Oh, this little doggy is the warrior who keeps Camilla safe.

1044
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,840
Or he would be if he was actually still full of life.

1045
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:38,460
Wait a second.

1046
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:44,460
I just realized, how are we going to go back to save
Missile?

1047
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:48,140
How does this not create a time paradox?

1048
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:50,420
If we're...

1049
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,940
How do we go back and save Missile?

1050
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:09,750

I thought he was a bad guy the whole time to be honest.

1057
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:02,250
No, he was a good guy

1058
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:17,150
It's a good red herring.

1059
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:17,950
It is yeah

1060
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:24,680

Thank you, Lovidov.

1073
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:06,180
Oh, oh, so close.

1074
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,300
So close.

1075
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:08,640
Just a little bit more.

1076
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:10,560
Oh, wait.

1077
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:11,160
I missed the...

1078
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,320
I missed the...

1079
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,440
Sorry, I missed the prompt.

1080
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,160
Okay.

1081
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:17,380
We're upstairs.

1082
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:18,420
There you are, Sissel!

1083
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:20,680
Sorry for the wait, Missile.

1084
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:28,180
If you want to see the best death in the game, let the
situation with Cabanella play out without doing anything.

1085
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:28,900
Really?

1086
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,540
Okay, we'll do that.

1087
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:36,880
Four minutes from now, the inspector will be killed by a
gun.

1088
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,520
You just jump in there and stop him from firing, would you?

1089
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,500
There you go again with that stuff.

1090
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:47,940
Besides, it doesn't make any sense.

1091
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:51,340
If you stop him from firing, he'll just kill you some other
way.

1092
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,540
Wait a minute, that sounds familiar.

1093
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:56,300
Yep, same situation as mine.

1094
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:05,060
Your best bet is this time around, is to allow him to shoot
and then save Cabanella without him noticing.

1095
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,120
It's even worse than last time.

1096
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,300
Anywho, jump in there and do something.

1097
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,340
I'm ready to jump in, Sissel.

1098
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,580
Oh, wait, so don't do anything?

1099
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,700
So I'm just gonna watch.

1100
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:21,400
I'm gonna eat my Pringles and watch.

1101
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:28,580
Okay.

1102
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:33,380
Time is passing.

1103
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:39,780
Did you see that?

1104
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,960
That bad sisle turned around!

1105
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:44,020
Do you have to call him that?

1106
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:46,960
But yeah, maybe this is our chance to try and do some ghost
tricks.

1107
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:49,500
It's the only time he takes his eyes off of me too.

1108
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,180
Do you have something to do?

1109
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:54,580
Okay.

1110
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,060
No, I don't think I will.

1111
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:03,690
I think I'm gonna...

1112
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:04,830
Objection.

1113
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:13,960
Nothing to say to you.

1114
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:18,140
Dang, he ragdolls over there so crazy like.

1115
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:19,900
It's like he got no bones.

1116
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:22,900
Is this all right?

1117
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:32,920
Oh, they see.

1118
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:33,260
Sam.

1119
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,100
I'm a little scared right now.

1120
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,480
Why didn't he die?

1121
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,560
Because he's already dead.

1122
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,440
He died ten years ago.

1123
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,660
I knew full well he wouldn't die if I shot him.

1124
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:48,440
And why did you go to the trouble of shooting him at all?

1125
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,100
Time's almost up.

1126
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,480
That's enough, Chit Chat.

1127
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,860
But now the situation has changed slightly.

1128
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:57,120
These last split seconds are our chance.

1129
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:57,860
They are?

1130
01:09:58,740 --> 01:09:59,100
Okay.

1131
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:04,120
Wait a second.

1132
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:05,840
Oh, there's a motor.

1133
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:11,950
Let's see.

1134
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:14,470
What goes on?

1135
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:19,520
This was...

1136
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,500
Oh, another condition.

1137
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,880
Wipe out everybody that knows about...

1138
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:23,620
He's going to shoot!

1139
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:24,320
It's too late!

1140
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:25,360
Again?

1141
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,780
I'm going to get shot again?

1142
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:28,160
No, wait!

1143
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,680
Our chance is coming up!

1144
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:32,180
The last split second, right?

1145
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,420
Leave it to me!

1146
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:35,700
Will you?

1147
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:43,740
Would you look at that?

1148
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:48,380
hanging in mid-air between the gun and the inspector's
forehead!

1149
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:50,560
Now's our chance!

1150
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:54,840
Wait, I'm here in the bullet right now!

1151
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,380
Let's swap this little thing with something else!

1152
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:58,220
Wait, what?

1153
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,220
It's our only hope, it is?

1154
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:06,300
Wait, there's gotta be something here with the same shape
and direction as the bullet!

1155
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:08,980
Uh...

1156
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:13,840
Hurry now!

1157
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,000
Swap that hanging bullet with something else!

1158
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,080
Oh.

1159
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:20,960
Oh.

1160
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:27,510
That's a bullet?

1161
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:31,940
What?

1162
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:35,860
What is the bullet even shape?

1163
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,980
I can't even tell what the shape is.

1164
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,360
I can't even tell.

1165
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:46,900
Is it with the hard hat?

1166
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:48,780
Oh my god.

1167
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:50,620
No way.

1168
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,240
Is this gonna work?

1169
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:54,460
Oh.

1170
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:06,990
That didn't go.

1171
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:09,770
Oh my god.

1172
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:11,570
We tried swapping.

1173
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:13,910
We'll be confined, but we just made things worse.

1174
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:15,610
Not nice, kids.

1175
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:16,590
Not nice at all.

1176
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:18,590
You put a dent in my lovely...

1177
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:24,570
Oh no.

1178
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:25,870
I don't have a napkin.

1179
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:28,690
Oh wait, maybe I do.

1180
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:32,190
No, I don't have a napkin.

1181
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:35,130
Because we bought her...

1182
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:37,870
to swap with.

1183
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:43,170
From the beginning means from this beginning, right?

1184
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:44,370
Not from the doctor's beginning.

1185
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:47,990
Oh, oh, wait.

1186
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:49,150
I want to see what he says here.

1187
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:52,610
You've got grit, little pigeon.

1188
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:56,050
I better get up there before the little pigeon's strength
that gives out.

1189
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:57,390
Missile's waiting for me.

1190
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:58,010
I better hurry.

1191
01:12:58,770 --> 01:12:59,030
Yeah.

1192
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:00,750
Okay.

1193
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:02,150
Um, give me...

1194
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:03,490
Don't worry, everybody falls for that.

1195
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:05,690
Give me one second.

1196
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:06,670
I'm going to go wash my hands.

1197
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:08,030
and get some more water.

1198
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:11,150
Sorry for the intermission.

1199
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:14,190
Mid-puzzle.

1200
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:15,310
But give me one second.

1201
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:19,390
I have no napkin and I have a dirty hand.

1202
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:23,690
I mean, I don't want to use my sleeves, even though they
cover my hands.

1203
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:24,290
But, you know.

1204
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:50,840
And I was out of hot water.

1205
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,700
I couldn't get any more water at all.

1206
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:58,580
Sorry.

1207
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,880
Oh, I left for no reason.

1208
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:14,900
and I filled up my thing again so um so uh it's boiling now
hmm you don't have a kettle that's what I'm using

1209
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:28,800
hmm thanks for all the super chat thank you guys I actually
got this puzzle wrong the first time because I didn't know

1210
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,540
what a bullet in flight was shaped like.

1211
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:33,420
That's, that's, that's weird, right?

1212
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:34,640
Okay.

1213
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:38,160
Once it's fired, the bullet will be the key to the whole
thing.

1214
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:38,480
Okay.

1215
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:40,280
Use my powers.

1216
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:40,580
Okay.

1217
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:42,920
So, trick time.

1218
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:49,640
Uh, we have to find something soft that is the shape of the
helmet.

1219
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:54,380
How do we get it over there, though?

1220
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:58,140
That's literally it.

1221
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,820
That's literally it.

1222
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:05,280
Oh, but we don't reach Hmm

1223
01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:21,690
Oh wait We can move through the step ladder Help me step
ladder I'm stuck Wait Wait

1224
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:37,840
ZR Oh, I can't reach there either I'm so useless Wait, I'm
stuck here Wait Wait!

1225
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:41,780
Wait!

1226
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:43,900
Oh wait, we have to wait for him to set it down, that's
right.

1227
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:47,100
I remember, I remember.

1228
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:50,260
Okay.

1229
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:51,640
Chance!

1230
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:55,800
Oh, wait.

1231
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:05,080
Ah, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh, oh, he's gonna turn around.

1232
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:08,440
Time is passing.

1233
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:09,800
Swevel!

1234
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,120
La la la.

1235
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:14,020
Don't notice me.

1236
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:15,220
Rock.

1237
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:17,020
Wait, if I rock it now, will he notice?

1238
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:18,260
Oh.

1239
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:19,360
Oopsie.

1240
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:21,940
What was that?

1241
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:25,120
Oh, I think I made things worse.

1242
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,280
Uh-oh.

1243
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:27,440
Uh-oh.

1244
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:29,300
Oopsie!

1245
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,780
Oh, wait.

1246
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:41,460
Oh, wait.

1247
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:46,000
No, because it would still launch the helmet.

1248
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,620
It would still launch the helmet.

1249
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Like, it would still go, you know?

1250
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:55,360
Pew.

1251
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,900
Because it would be in motion.

1252
01:19:05,610 --> 01:19:07,130
How do I get over there, though?

1253
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:12,870
How do I get over there?

1254
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,680
I can't be as long as you.

1255
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:21,660
Hmm.

1256
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:33,360
What was that noise?

1257
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,340
What was that noise?

1258
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,040
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1259
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:44,300
Ah!

1260
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:44,940
Oh.

1261
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,320
Oh, it's closer.

1262
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,140
It's closer.

1263
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,320
I forgot that.

1264
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:56,580
I forgot that that happened.

1265
01:19:57,980 --> 01:19:58,340
ZR.

1266
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,160
Wait, why is the music stopped?

1267
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,660
La la la la la la la la la la.

1268
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,400
Oh, that's why the music stopped.

1269
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:06,780
Oh no!

1270
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:09,860
Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle!

1271
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:13,640
Okay, now go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1272
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:17,600
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move!

1273
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,720
Now, I think we should be able to do it.

1274
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:22,820
I think.

1275
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,260
Now we just wait, right?

1276
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,960
Is Missile gonna intercept again?

1277
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:37,620
Oh, it looks like the book!

1278
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,040
Oh, the shape!

1279
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:41,200
Oh, you're right.

1280
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:44,360
Oh, you're right, it's too flat.

1281
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:45,920
Oh, no!

1282
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:50,780
Oh, okay, I shouldn't have moved the helmet on the ground.

1283
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:52,320
I should have kept it up there.

1284
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:52,900
Ah!

1285
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:54,400
Okay, okay.

1286
01:20:55,940 --> 01:20:57,160
I get it now.

1287
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,000
Okay, we'll restart.

1288
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:01,340
We'll restart.

1289
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:03,360
Are you sure?

1290
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:08,670
Don't reset?

1291
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:09,550
Okay.

1292
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:11,050
I'll try it.

1293
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:25,210
Okay.

1294
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:27,670
Even when my powers is nothing I can do.

1295
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:29,330
Swap the bullet with...

1296
01:21:30,370 --> 01:21:31,210
Sorry, Inspector.

1297
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:32,730
Oh, bobo, bobo, bobo.

1298
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:34,050
Oh, bobo, bobo, bobo.

1299
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:35,150
Wait.

1300
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:37,550
Swap?

1301
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:44,130
No, it's just hanging there.

1302
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:46,830
Oh, oh, I get it.

1303
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:49,030
Okay, I didn't realize that it would like...

1304
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:51,530
If I swapped it with the book, it would then slide down.

1305
01:21:51,550 --> 01:21:52,510
Oh!

1306
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:55,890
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1307
01:21:56,350 --> 01:21:57,570
I get it now, I get it.

1308
01:21:57,690 --> 01:21:58,350
Okay, okay, okay.

1309
01:21:59,070 --> 01:22:01,650
So I still had to rock it to the ground.

1310
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:04,870
Or like rock it, knock it over.

1311
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:06,890
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1312
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:11,350
No worries, no worries.

1313
01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:12,430
Okay.

1314
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:14,150
I get it.

1315
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:15,670
The game spoiled her.

1316
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:18,030
Yeah, pretty much.

1317
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:21,530
It's all a waiting game for most of this.

1318
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:21,910
though.

1319
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:24,910
So here we gotta wait.

1320
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:26,110
We gotta wait.

1321
01:22:26,350 --> 01:22:27,590
We gotta wait.

1322
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:30,690
La la la la la la la la.

1323
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:31,890
BAM!

1324
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:32,690
Okay.

1325
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:35,230
Then from here, we go here.

1326
01:22:35,470 --> 01:22:36,510
We go here, we go here.

1327
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:38,090
And we, oh, no.

1328
01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:38,650
Just kidding.

1329
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:39,410
We go here.

1330
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:41,590
And we wait for him to turn around.

1331
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:43,650
Objection.

1332
01:22:46,030 --> 01:22:46,550
Spin!

1333
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:51,530
Chup, chup, and rock.

to get shot yeah and I have to go really fast.

1335
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:15,230
Pieu!

1336
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:20,770
Nice.

1337
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:23,790
Just to hide.

1338
01:23:26,370 --> 01:23:27,250
Trick time.

1339
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:28,850
Okay.

1340
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:29,830
Oh,

1341
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:34,430

Move it!

1348
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:03,470
Okay, uh...

1349
01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:04,290
Swap it!

1350
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:07,410
Pop it!

1351
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:09,390
Twist it!

1352
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:10,170
Beep!

1353
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:11,610
Twist it!

1354
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:12,270
Beep!

1355
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:13,270
Swap it!

1356
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:13,870
Whop!

1357
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:19,410
Okay, and then Oh.

1358
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:22,150
But you look at that right on the hook.

1359
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:24,670
I love knit hats.

1360
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:27,190
So warm and most of all, soft.

1361
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:29,930
Why are you in my head?

1362
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:37,250
Now that I'm looking at it, that hat is the same shape as
the helmet that you just knocked down.

1363
01:24:38,330 --> 01:24:38,550
Aha!

1364
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:39,670
I thought so.

1365
01:24:41,030 --> 01:24:41,410
Yes.

1366
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:46,510
Now we'll intercept with a fuzzy hat.

1367
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:51,900
Bing!

1368
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:58,600
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

1369
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:01,640
Oh, I freaking...

1370
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,000
For so many times I was like, missile?

1371
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:03,480
Missile?

1372
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:04,060
Missile?

1373
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:04,600
Missile!

1374
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:05,940
Missile!

1375
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,860
Bullet with hat!

1376
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:12,080
Swap!

1377
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:14,400
Boom!

1378
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:15,420
Oh!

1379
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:20,160
Oh my god, he is freaking dead!

1380
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:26,740
Oh, he just totally didn't think anything of it.

1381
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,440
I don't think he noticed.

1382
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:31,580
Looks like he pulled off another magic disappearing act.

1383
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:37,600
And now I say again, I love Natats.

1384
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:40,820
So warm and most of all, soft.

1385
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:43,460
Did I, did I do all right?

1386
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,000
You did a fine job, little one.

1387
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:47,120
Go, Missile!

1388
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:52,800
Wait, you, wait, you guys, you guys, Did- did I do a good
job?

1389
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:58,740
Did- did- did Mint do a good job?

1390
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:14,060
Ear scratches for everyone.

1391
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:18,660
Minto de Grey.

1392
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:23,440
You saved another life.

1393
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,100
And I'll keep doing it too.

1394
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:27,040
Over and over.

1395
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:44,360
good job mint thank you what I just what I saw in just these
four minutes give me all the answers I've been looking for

1396
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:52,520
all I research these past 10 years pales in comparison right
professor yeah all I had to do was die so you two were

1397
01:26:52,520 --> 01:27:00,480
working together that's about the size of a yeah who would
believe a story about a manipulator so we pursued it

1398
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,500
ourselves It's just the two of us.

1399
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:06,280
I wonder if the knit hat is a reference to Hobo Phoenix R-
Hobo Hodo.

1400
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:07,600
Maybe.

1401
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:08,980
It is the same color.

1402
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,160
If it had a little button on it, then it for sure would be,
right?

1403
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:15,960
Or it would be the other way around.

1404
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:19,080
Maybe Phoenix's hat is a reference to this, right?

1405
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,520
Because this game came...

1406
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,080
I'm assuming this game came out after...

1407
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,140
I mean, before A.S.

1408
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:25,960
Apollo Justice, right?

1409
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,320
Takumi didn't work on Hobo Rite.

1410
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:44,980
didn't oh oh it was after this game was in 2009 oh i see i
see i see

1411
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:55,660
huh how can we help produce apollo i think

1412
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:08,620
i'm quite a crazy character myself after all okay let's
hurry back back to our time Thank you!

1413
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,800
Fortunately, I'm gonna have to miss the end of this game due
to sleep, but I hope you enjoy it.

1414
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:14,240
It's only gonna get twistier.

1415
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:14,660
Really?

1416
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:16,780
From here, even twistier!

1417
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:18,260
I'm excited.

1418
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:19,120
Thank you!

1419
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:20,960
We have to rescue Miss Camilla!

1420
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:22,700
You're right, Missile.

1421
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,000
And there's a certain guy I have to follow too.

1422
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:26,800
Yeah, me!

1423
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:30,640

1426
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:35,700
Hmm.

1427
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:47,600
wake up wake up inspector it was the performance of a
lifetime after completing his revenge on inspector cavanella

1428
01:28:47,600 --> 01:29:00,460
the man in red left and now a new story is about to unfold
and a new present we saved two people how are you feeling

1429
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,020
you old crazy character

1430
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:16,300
what the ghost doing hey there prof we're both alive I see
yeah nothing like it baby but I don't know if I'm getting

1431
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:24,600
old or what I've got a few aches and pains here and there
used to be a little thing like an explosion used to be a

1432
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:32,660
little thing like an explosion wouldn't bother me yeah right
like I'm going to believe that so what the guy in red is

1433
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:37,960
gone eh just in case I posted special investigation units
around the building.

1434
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:41,280
Let's just pray the boys came through for us.

1435
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:43,320
What if they got paid off though?

1436
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,080
You can't trust anybody.

1437
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,460
Not even yourself, apparently.

1438
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:49,020
Damn it.

1439
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:52,060
You've picked a bad time not to listen to me, buddy of mine.

1440
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:55,060
Inspector Cabanella is so cool.

1441
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:56,520
You got this.

1442
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:57,880
Trick time.

1443
01:29:58,600 --> 01:29:59,120
Uh.

1444
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,060
Well, it looks like both of their deaths were erased.

1445
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:10,920
Unfortunately, in the case of the I mean, how are you
supposed to stop his bones being broken from an explosion?

1446
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:17,680
But it might, but in any case, these two have the
information I need to start tracking the manipulator.

1447
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,300
I'd better talk to them.

1448
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:22,280
I want to talk to the bird.

1449
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:26,300
How is Missal doing?

1450
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:29,660
All right, Sisal, it's time to go!

1451
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:34,280
Out into the big wide world to rescue Miss Camilla!

1452
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,400
Hold on a minute, Missal.

1453
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:38,400
I have to talk to these two first.

1454
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:39,200
Oh.

1455
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:40,520
Okay.

1456
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:42,240
I understand.

1457
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:44,180
But just know one thing.

1458
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:46,980
I go where the wind takes me.

1459
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,160
Is this little doggy trying to put pressure on me?

1460
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:52,520
Okay.

1461
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:53,720
Let's talk.

1462
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,740
Mr. Superintendent.

1463
01:30:58,140 --> 01:30:59,520
Do you mind if I talk to you for a minute?

1464
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:03,040
I haven't always been a junkyard superintendent.

1465
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:05,420
Intendant.

1466
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:07,680
Superintendent.

1467
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:10,980
Superintendent, you know.

1468
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:13,000
I used to be part of the police.

1469
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:14,540
The police, huh?

1470
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:16,880
He's like a leaf in the wind.

1471
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:18,720
Super Nintendo.

1472
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:19,340
No.

1473
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:24,480
Not as a detective, but as a medical examiner.

1474
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,720
I investigated victims' cause of death.

1475
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:28,060
Ooh.

1476
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:29,820
Like mine?

1477
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:34,520
Ten years ago, I was asked to autopsy a strange corpse.

1478
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:38,440
Hit by a meteorite fragment and died instantly.

1479
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,380
That's what the police report said.

1480
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,560
Well, what if the police report is wrong, too?

1481
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:49,180
What if everything is wrong?

1482
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:51,380
There were no signs of life.

1483
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:53,280
He was definitely dead.

1484
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:56,540
But I never filed an autopsy report.

1485
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:04,090
That's because the corpse suddenly vanished.

1486
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:07,770
Leaving behind only one clue.

1487
01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:12,450
An unusual clue.

1488
01:32:13,010 --> 01:32:13,490
Corpse.

1489
01:32:14,410 --> 01:32:15,970
I bet that's what I've been chasing all night.

1490
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:19,070
Wouldn't it be like soul?

1491
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:21,730
It would be bones.

1492
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:22,930
It would just be bones.

1493
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:24,170
We'd be a walking skeleton.

1494
01:32:26,430 --> 01:32:27,970
Could you tell me more?

1495
01:32:29,290 --> 01:32:29,770
Yeah, sure.

1496
01:32:30,050 --> 01:32:33,670
I have an interest in you recovering your memory and finding
your true identity too.

1497
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:35,870
Unusual corpse.

1498
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:38,590
That's the only way I can describe it to.

1499
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:40,470
It was an unusual corpse.

1500
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:42,270
Oh, he was dead alright.

1501
01:32:42,410 --> 01:32:43,530
No question about that.

1502
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:47,710
But there wasn't a scratch on him.

1503
01:32:48,570 --> 01:32:53,830
Not a scratch, but I thought he was hit by a meteorite
fragment.

1504
01:32:57,770 --> 01:33:01,590
Spooky scary skeletons and shivers down your spine.

1505
01:33:02,930 --> 01:33:05,690
You gotta manipulate the blood flow and flow of nutrients.

1506
01:33:08,110 --> 01:33:10,310
I don't understand it any more than you do.

1507
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:11,930
Okay.

1508
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:25,410
it's aliens aliens aliens I was completely bewildered but
when I tried to autopsy him I was even more puzzled I

1509
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:33,590
couldn't perform the autopsy it's like he's like
manipulating the body but trying to be kind of like

1510
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:40,530
inconspicuous about it so it's just like or sorry
conspicuous about it so he's just like he'll like go in with

1511
01:33:40,530 --> 01:33:47,290
the knife and the hand just kind of shoots up like maybe
that's not very conspicuous at all actually wait is it

1512
01:33:47,290 --> 01:34:07,190
inconspicuous or conspicuous now i'm confused i don't know
wait which one inconspicuous equals subtle subtle okay okay

1513
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:24,590
i switched them around i had it right the first time
confused you okay now I remember I thought I had it right

1514
01:34:24,590 --> 01:34:37,170
you couldn't what do you mean the scalpel went in but I
couldn't cut as soon as I tried to make an incision it would

1515
01:34:37,170 --> 01:34:43,850
heal up in the very next instant that's how it went and no
scarring your blood either.

1516
01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:47,690
The rock makes you immortal?

1517
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:51,830
And I never had the chance to solve the mystery.

1518
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:56,110
That's because the corpse up and vanished on us.

1519
01:34:57,730 --> 01:35:00,250
The morgue is well guarded.

1520
01:35:00,730 --> 01:35:02,070
Nobody could have stolen that body.

1521
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:09,900
But there is one way the corpse could have disappeared.

1522
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:11,800
What's that?

1523
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:18,820
If he just got up and walked out himself.

1524
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:34,680
He's bisexual.

1525
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:36,520
Vamp.

1526
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,900
It got up, opened the door, and walked out on its own.

1527
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:42,200
Wait, is that on the security camera?

1528
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:43,320
What?

1529
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:46,220
He was dead, but he wasn't dead.

1530
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:49,480
We saw it with our own eyes tonight.

1531
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,600
Not even that explosion could kill him.

1532
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:55,740
And he didn't even feel it when he slammed his fist onto
that stove.

1533
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:03,060
The corpse left behind some data from some...

1534
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:04,700
Blip, blip, blip!

1535
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:09,120
The corpse left behind some data from some testing I did.

1536
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:12,920
I got some readings for some kind of radiation.

1537
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,840
Coming off the body!

1538
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,720
No wonder this town is so kooky!

1539
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:24,180
They're all... they all have radiation poisoning!

1540
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:27,640
No wonder everyone is so eccentric!

1541
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:29,700
Oh my god!

1542
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:32,240
Radiation.

1543
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:34,380
Radioactive!

1544
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:36,020
Radioactive!

1545
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:41,740
I used all kinds of instruments, but I couldn't determine
exactly what kind of radiation it was.

1546
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:45,740
Sub- Sorry.

1547
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:47,260
I'm a discovered type.

1548
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:48,720
From a world unknown.

1549
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:51,100
Wait a minute.

1550
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:51,840
Could it be?

1551
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:53,140
That's right.

1552
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,580
It was coming from that meteorite fragment.

1553
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,840
Aliens, aliens, aliens!

1554
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:07,340
Oh my gosh, I'm getting super outer wild vibes right now.

1555
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:12,540
Just because I'm thinking of, like, the rock and outer
wilds, you know, and how it was so mysterious.

1556
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,020
Ghost of matter.

1557
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:15,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1558
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:19,680
No, I'm thinking of the one that when you turn around, it
would disappear.

1559
01:37:20,580 --> 01:37:23,240
I went to that park and tested the spot where the meteorite
fell.

1560
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:27,200
coming from that creator.

1561
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:31,680
It was the exact same pattern of radiation as that of the
corpse.

1562
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:33,680
Yes, the quantum rock!

1563
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:35,760
Yes, yes, yes.

1564
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:38,720
At the time, I thought he was some kind of immortal being.

1565
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:41,140
He would die only to come back to life.

1566
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:46,320
I wanted to research it all in depth, so I quit my job as a
police medical examiner.

1567
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:52,720
Several years later, I came to learn the connection between
my research.

1568
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:55,720
I'm so sorry I keep you all.

1569
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:56,900
I'm so sorry.

1570
01:37:58,300 --> 01:37:59,040
I'm so sorry.

1571
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:03,420
My research and the manipulator case.

1572
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:06,940
Thanks to the arrival of this crazy character here.

1573
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:09,040
Oh, stop now, Professor.

1574
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:10,960
Do you want to see me blush?

1575
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:14,800
Cabanella's arrival.

1576
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:17,580
Please continue.

1577
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:18,900
I gotta get more water.

1578
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:29,580
It was about a year ago, I say.

1579
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:31,120
Akubi, tascar!

1580
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:33,160
Tascara not!

1581
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:38,400
This man in white came dancing into my research lab here.

1582
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:43,460
Mint, are you the byproduct of radiation too?

1583
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:55,340
Um...

1584
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:56,160
Am I a freak?

1585
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:58,700
I don't glow at night.

1586
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:00,820
I don't glow in the dark.

1587
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:02,120
Sometimes.

1588
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:02,800
I don't know.

1589
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:06,300
You are green?

1590
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:12,100
Wait, I am a freak!

1591
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:13,720
I'm a freaky ghost maid!

1592
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:24,470
I think we should explore this later.

1593
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:30,910
I heard there was an oddball here who's researching Temsik.

1594
01:39:31,310 --> 01:39:32,410
Is that you, baby?

1595
01:39:33,010 --> 01:39:34,950
Like how he calls everybody, baby.

1596
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:39,190
Even to the old man scientist.

1597
01:39:40,210 --> 01:39:42,330
Who are you to be calling anybody an oddball?

1598
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:48,470
Maybe I came from outer space.

1599
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:54,190
Maybe I came from outer space.

1600
01:39:55,690 --> 01:39:56,590
Uranium rod.

1601
01:39:58,690 --> 01:40:00,370
Maybe I'm actually an alien.

1602
01:40:01,330 --> 01:40:02,130
Maan, welcome to membership.

1603
01:40:02,490 --> 01:40:02,990
Thank you!

1604
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:05,130
Wow, what convinced you, Maan?

1605
01:40:05,310 --> 01:40:07,790
Did you think like, oh my gosh, she's an alien?

1606
01:40:08,350 --> 01:40:09,770
I love aliens.

1607
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:10,990
You know?

1608
01:40:11,190 --> 01:40:13,070
Space, ghost, coast to coast!

1609
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,120
The dots keep connecting, you guys.

1610
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:23,180
kind of crazy.

1611
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,560
The thoughts keep connecting.

1612
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:33,180
I was investigating the manipulator case then.

1613
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:34,800
And then I heard there was a man

1614
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:41,820
who'd quit the police force to study the meteorite.

1615
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:45,300
When I heard that, it was like a meteorite had struck me on
the head.

1616
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:48,340
Oh, look at all of them.

1617
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,720
Oh my gosh, wait, I completely forgot about the guy on the
left.

1618
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:52,400
The guy who has his toes out.

1619
01:40:52,420 --> 01:40:56,320
At the time, we were just starting to get leads on this
manipulator.

1620
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,740
We didn't know who he was yet.

1621
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:00,780
Spacemento!

1622
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:05,620
But we knew he was communicating with a certain foreign
country.

1623
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:09,660
In one of those communications, we heard the manipulator say
this.

1624
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:17,760
The source of my power is not of this world.

1625
01:41:21,030 --> 01:41:21,690
End transmission.

1626
01:41:22,350 --> 01:41:24,670
And that's when I put two and two together, baby.

1627
01:41:25,530 --> 01:41:28,170
The manipulator case and Temsik were somehow connected.

1628
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:35,810
Which also explained how five years ago he used his powers
to manipulate a birthday surprise a little girl made by her

1629
01:41:35,810 --> 01:41:36,230
mother.

1630
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:41,010
He added that gun to the contraption, most likely by
controlling Camilla.

1631
01:41:44,190 --> 01:41:45,650
You're starting to freak me out.

1632
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:46,790
What's wrong?

1633
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:56,630
If I haven't served you freaking you out from the beginning,
I'm not doing my job as a the ghost well enough honestly all

1634
01:41:56,630 --> 01:42:04,630
right now we talk to cabanella if i knew things were going
to end up like this i would have tried to die in that

1635
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:15,770
explosion baby that way i could have been dancing after big
red by now i might be able to erase deaths but it's true i

1636
01:42:15,770 --> 01:42:23,490
can't do much about injuries but really you shouldn't talk
that way yeah sorry i suppose you're right i just hate

1637
01:42:23,490 --> 01:42:36,530

just missed the puzzle sorry all our plans were resting on

1638
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:43,650

about his spotless record it's not too late inspector we

1639
01:42:43,650 --> 01:42:50,990
still have a chance maybe I can catch him say you're right
that's not a bad idea I'll cooperate with you fully go ahead

1640
01:42:50,990 --> 01:42:52,850
and fire away with any questions you like mr.

Oh wait, actually?

1661
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:33,580

1666

who stole his life away 10 years ago he's a fool he's the

1667
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:41,120
one who made the decision to take that little girl hostage
and he wound up He only has himself to blame.

1668
01:48:41,620 --> 01:48:42,020
It's true.

1669
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:45,060
But what about when he said this?

1670
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:47,800
Oh, that it was a lie.

1671
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:48,600
Yeah, right?

1672
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:50,700
I was murdered by all of you.

1673
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:52,840
Detective Jowd, who forced me into a corner.

1674
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:55,000
Lynn, the girl who was playing in the park.

1675
01:48:55,940 --> 01:48:57,640
And finally, you, Inspector Cabanella.

1676
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:02,360
If you hadn't done what you did, I never would have pointed
a gun at that kid.

1677
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:03,540
Mmm.

1678
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,320
Mmm...

1679
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,140
Spill the beans, Cabanella.

1680
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:18,600
Ten years ago, on that day, the special investigation unit
was working on a certain big case.

1681
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:22,960
We hauled in a young man, an important witness to our
investigation.

1682
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:24,960
And then I did it.

1683
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,380
I made two very stupid mistakes.

1684
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:31,080
Oh.

1685
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:34,980
Detective, I'm telling you!

1686
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:36,780
I don't know anything about it!

1687
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:45,080
fine you're under no obligation to talk of course but if you
don't the special investigation unit can make the rest of

1688
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:51,360
your life a living hell what he's a witness why are you if
he's just a witness why are you interrogating him like

1689
01:49:54,380 --> 01:50:01,940
this the first mistake was being a big meanie but what I I

1690
01:50:07,820 --> 01:50:15,280
just been assigned to the special investigation unit you see
they didn't share much information on big cases with a

1691
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:16,280
newbie like me yet.

1692
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:18,080
And I wanted to impress them.

1693
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:19,560
Good cop, bad cop?

1694
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:20,840
No!

1695
01:50:22,620 --> 01:50:25,760
It was only supposed to be a simple matter of taking a
statement.

1696
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:27,820
But I was too green.

1697
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:29,320
Me!

1698
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:30,340
I'm green.

1699
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:32,920
I'm a mix of blue, too.

1700
01:50:34,220 --> 01:50:35,440
I pushed him too hard.

1701
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:38,120
I drove him into a corner and made him lose all hope.

1702
01:50:38,860 --> 01:50:40,140
That was my first mistake.

1703
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:43,700
And then I made him another mistake on top of that.

1704
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,080
He was too minty.

1705
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:51,080
It ain't easy being...

1706
01:50:53,420 --> 01:50:54,300
It ain't...

1707
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:55,800
Inti being minty.

1708
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:58,600
Cabanello, got a minute?

1709
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:01,080
The chief wants to see you about your report.

1710
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:02,700
Oh no, you left him in there!

1711
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:03,840
Got it.

1712
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:05,000
I'll be right there.

1713
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:10,000
You stay right here and be a good boy now.

1714
01:51:13,660 --> 01:51:16,000
Oh my god, is that why he said good boy to Cabanello?

1715
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,640
Oh my god.

1716
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:24,420
He's been thinking about that for a long time.

1717
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:31,260
That's when I did it.

1718
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:34,600
I left it behind in the interrogation room.

1719
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:36,480
My gun!

1720
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:38,720
Oh my god, you're so...

1721
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:39,220
What?

1722
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:46,390
How could you?

1723
01:51:46,750 --> 01:51:48,330
He used my gun to escape.

1724
01:51:48,350 --> 01:51:48,570
escape.

1725
01:51:49,670 --> 01:51:50,630
What he said is true.

1726
01:51:51,110 --> 01:51:57,270
If I hadn't made that mistake, he never would have had a gun
to point at Lynn in the first place.

1727
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:03,720
Fire this guy.

1728
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:05,620
I know, right?

1729
01:52:05,700 --> 01:52:07,000
How is he not fired?

1730
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:08,900
Manipulator.

1731
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:14,320
We first found out about the manipulator's existence during
a certain overseas communication.

1732
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:16,060
Overseas communication.

1733
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:17,040
Overseas communication.

1734
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:22,540
For national security purposes, this country keeps networks.

1735
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:27,680
This particular communication was about making a deal with a
certain foreign country.

1736
01:52:28,980 --> 01:52:31,360
Cicel, you said you'd say put him be a good boy.

1737
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:35,380
Oh my god, you guys.

1738
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:38,340
I sometimes say that to Paz.

1739
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:42,940
But I actually think I have to rename her Johnny.

1740
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:44,820
Oh my god.

1741
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:54,760
This morning, I think I'm so tired because this morning was
a little bit stressful for me and that i was just cleaning

1742
01:52:54,760 --> 01:53:06,380
up so much shit i'm never i i went down to pet her and i pet
her she was looking out the window i pet her and i my my

1743
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:07,500
hand was wet

1744
01:53:16,650 --> 01:53:29,910
and then and then i looked at her i was like what and then i
just saw poop all over her poop everywhere And then she was,

1745
01:53:29,910 --> 01:53:31,330
like, walking on the couch.

1746
01:53:31,910 --> 01:53:33,450
She was walking everywhere.

1747
01:53:37,660 --> 01:53:38,620
It's Johnny.

1748
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:42,500
Have you taken her to the vet?

1749
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:45,540
Well, I've changed her food a couple times.

1750
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:50,360
So, I know, like, I've been, it's, it's...

1751
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:56,040
When I got her, I tried weaning her off the food that they
gave me that she was used to.

1752
01:53:56,560 --> 01:54:00,800
But, she didn't, she wouldn't eat it.

1753
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:07,800
And so, I started giving her a new food, and then she had a
bad tummy ache, and I was like, I don't know, I can't

1754
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:09,280
pinpoint the problem.

1755
01:54:10,180 --> 01:54:15,260
Oh, I'm like, is she, is she, like, have the sensitive
stomach to something, or?

1756
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:18,680
I had a shitty kitty, it sucked.

1757
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:20,960
Oh, I've never had.

1758
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:22,680
She's not using the box.

1759
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:24,280
No, she is, she is, she is.

1760
01:54:25,180 --> 01:54:28,680
It's just, she poops liquid.

1761
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:41,720
well sometimes not always oh it's just it's been so bad it's
been so stressful on me i'm just cleaning up poop all the

1762
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:48,520
time oh it's so bad

1763
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:07,560
allergy i thought that might be the case so i've tried like
you know i was like maybe The worst of it was when she had

1764
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:09,640
chicken, and so I thought maybe she can't have chicken.

1765
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:13,000
And then I would try something else, and then she would
still be poopy.

1766
01:55:14,260 --> 01:55:16,500
Oh, man.

1767
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:18,200
Everything is poop.

1768
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:20,800
I know, my God.

1769
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:32,420
Thanks, Austin, a lot for the super chat.

1770
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:38,000
Anyway, sorry about that.

1771
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:40,400
Why did I think about that?

1772
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:43,880
Why did I think about my cat's poop?

1773
01:55:55,940 --> 01:55:58,320
Have you went to the vet to check their stomach?

1774
01:55:58,440 --> 01:55:59,060
Not yet.

1775
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:09,780
Actually, I had to take Bhutaro to the emergency vet like
literally a couple days ago.

1776
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:13,800
I had to take him to the emergency vet.

1777
01:56:15,620 --> 01:56:22,900
it's just been I'm like oh my god I've just been running
back and forth to vets over and over and over and over and

1778
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:30,580
over and over again I might have had a minor breakdown about
it today when I was cleaning up shit so I think that's why

1779
01:56:30,580 --> 01:56:38,460
I'm so tired is he okay yeah he's okay he's fine he had a
cold and he wasn't getting over it so I just had to get him

1780
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:46,480
some extra antibiotics so yeah hmm Anyway.

1781
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:51,700
Vet cost.

1782
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,360
Oh my god.

1783
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:54,380
I've probably...

1784
01:56:54,380 --> 01:56:57,780
Yeah, I don't even want to think about how much I've spent
on...

1785
01:56:57,780 --> 01:57:00,540
Luckily, I'm in a position where I can afford it, right?

1786
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:01,880
But...

1787
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:02,580
Oh god.

1788
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:13,200
But But But Butato's doing much better now.

1789
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:14,980
He got...

1790
01:57:14,980 --> 01:57:15,900
He got his shots.

1791
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:16,760
He got some...

1792
01:57:16,780 --> 01:57:26,080
antibiotic shots and stuff so yeah survival

1793
01:57:29,170 --> 01:57:31,110

already do so much as it is so yeah anyway this particular

1799
01:58:35,850 --> 01:58:40,290
let's get back to the game right this particular
communication was about making a deal with a certain foreign

1800
01:58:40,290 --> 01:58:50,750
country oh he said he wanted them to buy him whoa you can
see his outline whoa it looks like wait can you Can you guys

1801
01:58:50,750 --> 01:58:51,350
see it?

1802
01:58:51,710 --> 01:58:52,270
An OBS?

1803
01:58:52,470 --> 01:58:53,050
I can see it.

1804
01:58:53,130 --> 01:58:53,530
It looks so cool.

1805
01:58:53,590 --> 01:58:54,710
You cannot stop me.

1806
01:58:55,090 --> 01:58:55,430
Stop!

1807
01:58:58,210 --> 01:59:03,950
Oh, I think she's just, you know, she's a kitten and it's
growing pains, maybe.

1808
01:59:04,770 --> 01:59:05,630
You can't see him?

1809
01:59:05,710 --> 01:59:06,510
That's so weird.

1810
01:59:07,130 --> 01:59:08,570
Maybe I'm gonna take a picture.

1811
01:59:08,750 --> 01:59:09,030
Oh, wait.

1812
01:59:09,570 --> 01:59:10,030
Oh, I can't.

1813
01:59:10,150 --> 01:59:10,710
I take a picture.

1814
01:59:10,830 --> 01:59:11,470
It won't show up.

1815
01:59:11,690 --> 01:59:12,210
I don't think.

1816
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:16,350
Oh, it does.

1817
01:59:17,010 --> 01:59:17,770
Oh, no, it doesn't.

1818
01:59:17,930 --> 01:59:18,250
Dang.

1819
01:59:19,710 --> 01:59:20,290
Never mind.

1820
01:59:20,530 --> 01:59:21,370
That's so weird.

1821
01:59:22,470 --> 01:59:26,670
Anyway, he said he wanted them to buy him him and his
powers.

1822
01:59:27,230 --> 01:59:27,890
Buy him?

1823
01:59:31,250 --> 01:59:32,950
That's how we first heard about him.

1824
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:35,490
Of course we didn't know what he looked like at the time.

1825
01:59:37,270 --> 01:59:41,390
And in order to prove these powers of his, he gave them two
predictions.

1826
01:59:41,910 --> 01:59:45,210
He foresaw two completely preposterous impossible cases.

1827
01:59:45,830 --> 01:59:49,930
The case of a man who would sing national secrets during a
live rock concert broadcast.

1828
01:59:51,370 --> 01:59:55,370
who would take the chief commissioner hostage in his own
office.

1829
01:59:56,970 --> 01:59:58,910
Those two inmates at the special prison, eh?

1830
02:00:03,570 --> 02:00:07,070
We kept tabs on their communications and launched an
investigation.

1831
02:00:08,090 --> 02:00:12,370
And then finally, we pinpointed where they were going to
meet tonight and staked it out.

1832
02:00:14,390 --> 02:00:15,510
Blue Lady.

1833
02:00:16,230 --> 02:00:17,330
That restaurant.

1834
02:00:19,470 --> 02:00:20,630
The chicken kitchen.

1835
02:00:23,150 --> 02:00:26,030
The manipulator plans on leaving this country tonight.

1836
02:00:26,730 --> 02:00:29,870
On a submarine that belongs to the other country in this
deal.

1837
02:00:31,470 --> 02:00:31,910
Submarine!

1838
02:00:34,330 --> 02:00:37,310
But we haven't been able to find out where it's going to
surface.

1839
02:00:38,010 --> 02:00:42,290
It's terrifying to think what would happen if his powers
were to fall into their hands.

1840
02:00:42,410 --> 02:00:43,430
That means we just have to...

1841
02:00:43,430 --> 02:00:48,490
Wait, we can teleport back to the sub, and we can listen in
on stuff.

1842
02:00:48,490 --> 02:01:00,830
I don't know If Blue Country has Blue Lady Doesn't seem so
bad Right Highly unlikely they'd use them for peaceful

1843
02:01:00,830 --> 02:01:11,470
purposes And now they have that little girl as a hostage
Camilla We have to stop him before he leaves the country

1844
02:01:13,470 --> 02:01:20,470
Sorry Spotless record This spotless record of yours Is it
really that important to you?

1845
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:21,750
Of course, baby.

1846
02:01:22,530 --> 02:01:24,870
In some ways, it's more important to me than my life.

1847
02:01:25,590 --> 02:01:26,450
Than your life, eh?

1848
02:01:27,050 --> 02:01:31,010
After all, it's because of my record that I'm able to get my
hands on all intel.

1849
02:01:31,450 --> 02:01:33,630
As head of the Special Investigation Unit.

1850
02:01:34,330 --> 02:01:35,870
I'm moving to Blue Lady Country.

1851
02:01:36,810 --> 02:01:39,470
Al in favor of moving to Blue Lady Country.

1852
02:01:40,050 --> 02:01:41,010
Say I!

1853
02:01:43,470 --> 02:01:50,490
I, I, I, I, I, oh, I, me, me, mint, I, Oh, I am...

1854
02:01:52,750 --> 02:01:53,230
Yay!

1855
02:01:55,930 --> 02:01:57,390
Oh, because of my position.

1856
02:01:58,010 --> 02:02:02,230
I get to direct all aspects of the investigation into the
manipulator case.

1857
02:02:03,470 --> 02:02:06,130
What confuses me about this, though, is he knew all of this.

1858
02:02:06,830 --> 02:02:10,370
But still was going to allow Detective Jowd to be executed?

1859
02:02:10,770 --> 02:02:11,890
Oh, but I guess I would...

1860
02:02:11,890 --> 02:02:14,410
Because Detective Jowd confessed, right?

1861
02:02:14,510 --> 02:02:15,930
And he wanted the spotless record.

1862
02:02:17,130 --> 02:02:17,850
Never mind.

1863
02:02:19,410 --> 02:02:23,170
Consider a country with Blue Lady also have Blue Shaggy.

1864
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:31,400
All in favor of killing Blue Shaggy.

1865
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:32,740
Say I.

1866
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:34,800
I, I.

1867
02:02:35,260 --> 02:02:36,420
Oh, pick me, my lord.

1868
02:02:36,640 --> 02:02:37,540
Pick me.

1869
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:39,260
I.

1870
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:40,920
Yeah,

1871
02:02:46,180 --> 02:02:46,360
I.

1872
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:49,440
No, not my Oshi.

1873
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:51,140
Your Oshi killed a dog.

1874
02:02:51,220 --> 02:02:52,240
What are you talking about?

1875
02:02:54,700 --> 02:02:56,700
Your Oshi killed my Oshi.

1876
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:00,160
The manipulator case.

1877
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:02,860
That's why you cared about your record so much.

1878
02:03:03,580 --> 02:03:04,920
I mean, I'm not going to lie.

1879
02:03:05,340 --> 02:03:08,940
I think the manipulator case is a really big thing to care
about.

1880
02:03:09,420 --> 02:03:09,620
Right?

1881
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:17,080
Like, this guy is able to transcend time and space and
people and dimensions.

1882
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:21,920
I think that's a pretty big threat to international
security.

1883
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,040
Of course.

1884
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:25,280
Why else, baby?

1885
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:27,760
Yeah, it seems like a pretty big deal.

1886
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:32,900
I just could never believe it, man.

1887
02:03:33,460 --> 02:03:34,580
Jal, shooting Alma.

1888
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:36,920
I didn't care that he confessed.

1889
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:39,160
There was definitely something more to the story.

1890
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:40,360
Some secret.

1891
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:45,080
I did everything I could to climb the ladder.

1892
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:46,520
Everything in my power.

1893
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:48,540
And then I finally found the answer.

1894
02:03:49,060 --> 02:03:51,520
It took five long years, though.

1895
02:03:51,940 --> 02:03:52,780
The manipulator.

1896
02:03:52,860 --> 02:03:55,580
He's going to prove that Jowd is innocent.

1897
02:03:56,720 --> 02:03:58,080
What incredible determination.

1898
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:00,200
Oh.

1899
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:02,340
Cabanela's determination.

1900
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:05,340
Mint after consulting with scientists.

1901
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:06,800
You're not a byproduct.

1902
02:04:07,060 --> 02:04:07,640
Radiation.

1903
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,540
But a byproduct.

1904
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:11,380
Electro.

1905
02:04:16,190 --> 02:04:18,390
Am I a vampire too?

1906
02:04:19,770 --> 02:04:20,950
Oh my god.

1907
02:04:25,950 --> 02:04:28,030
There's one thing I just don't understand.

1908
02:04:29,330 --> 02:04:31,250
If you were so determined to help Detective Jalad.

1909
02:04:33,930 --> 02:04:35,530
Why didn't you help him escape from prison?

1910
02:04:36,270 --> 02:04:37,570
Perfect record, perfect record.

1911
02:04:38,150 --> 02:04:38,950
That's an easy one, baby.

1912
02:04:39,930 --> 02:04:41,810
Escaping from prison is a crime.

1913
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:52,540
I wasn't about to help him commit a crime after spending
five years trying to prove him innocent.

1914
02:04:54,300 --> 02:04:56,540
And he himself has to be executed, you know?

1915
02:04:57,020 --> 02:05:01,360
As a man of the law, sure that the execution was stopped
legally.

1916
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:06,060
That's why I brought him before the Justice Minister too.

1917
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:09,720
I needed to buy as much time as I possibly could, baby.

1918
02:05:11,500 --> 02:05:14,660
Oh, I think they're a little backed up.

1919
02:05:14,900 --> 02:05:15,940
Wrong for Rabbit, thank you.

1920
02:05:16,780 --> 02:05:18,280
You remember how this game used to be?

1921
02:05:18,440 --> 02:05:24,080
Haha, this guy's one step ahead, Tango, and this ghost
leaves two times, but mint.

1922
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:27,760
Now it's about revengeants and aliens and crazy plot twists.

1923
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,100
So true.

1924
02:05:33,460 --> 02:05:35,480
I love the soundtrack so much.

1925
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:36,200
It's so good.

1926
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:40,020
But there's one little unfortunate result of all of this.

1927
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:43,340
Lynn completely misunderstood your intentions.

1928
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:44,580
Ha!

1929
02:05:45,180 --> 02:05:46,720
What's a little misunderstanding?

1930
02:05:47,300 --> 02:05:48,520
My baby will come around.

1931
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:49,520
Give it time.

1932
02:05:50,700 --> 02:05:53,560
But there are more important things to do with our time
tonight.

1933
02:05:55,460 --> 02:05:57,020
Trauma is one of the best tracks.

1934
02:05:57,180 --> 02:05:58,220
Is that what this is called?

1935
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:00,420
Trauma!

1936
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:01,760
Thank you, thank you!

1937
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:02,060
Choo!

1938
02:06:02,540 --> 02:06:02,860
Choo!

1939
02:06:03,780 --> 02:06:05,760
I came back from a three-mile walk with my dog.

1940
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:11,660
And I po- All I hear is men talking about liquid poop.

1941
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:12,960
I'm sorry!

1942
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:14,640
Kitty funds, thank you!

1943
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:15,480
Thank you, Hyper.

1944
02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:16,980
Thank you, thank you.

1945
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:22,880
So that contraption in the basement here, you built that to
try and help Detective Jowd?

1946
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:25,260
That's right.

1947
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:28,620
Jowd and I worked together back when I was with the Force.

1948
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:32,520
I used the reports of his case to try and recreate the
device.

1949
02:06:33,420 --> 02:06:38,860
But there was just one part of it that I couldn't reproduce,
no matter how hard I tried.

1950
02:06:39,260 --> 02:06:39,640
What is it?

1951
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:41,200
The cupid turning around?

1952
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:44,960
R, R, R, R.

1953
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:48,700
Thank you for the pink don't know.

1954
02:06:48,820 --> 02:06:49,720
Thank you so much.

1955
02:06:50,020 --> 02:06:51,920
No super chats got it.

1956
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:54,440
Thank you.

1957
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:56,060
Blue cheese.

1958
02:06:56,200 --> 02:06:56,840
Thanks for the thank you.

1959
02:06:57,220 --> 02:06:58,160
Thank you so much.

1960
02:06:58,380 --> 02:06:58,660
Thank you.

1961
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:02,320
Camilla told Jal- Oh my goodness!

1962
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:05,440
Blue lady is hot.

1963
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:05,600
Hmm?

1964
02:07:05,900 --> 02:07:06,460
Shaggy?

1965
02:07:10,070 --> 02:07:12,030
Liquid poop is the best part.

1966
02:07:12,230 --> 02:07:12,470
No.

1967
02:07:13,390 --> 02:07:14,450
How do I say your name?

1968
02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:17,150
Is it Ian Tua or is it Lan Tua?

1969
02:07:20,870 --> 02:07:22,210
Can't tell if it's an L.

1970
02:07:22,650 --> 02:07:24,490
Lowercase L or an uppercase I.

1971
02:07:26,530 --> 02:07:31,770
My friend Bob Sakamano had a kitten and I visited him once.

1972
02:07:31,790 --> 02:07:34,890
and I was going to return some pants, the cat shat right on
me, really.

1973
02:07:41,070 --> 02:07:42,370
I'm sorry, that's not funny.

1974
02:07:42,510 --> 02:07:43,530
We're gonna return them.

1975
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:44,510
It's so sad.

1976
02:07:46,010 --> 02:07:47,510
Kitten's gonna kitten, I guess.

1977
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:49,010
I guess.

1978
02:07:50,170 --> 02:07:52,650
Camilla told Jowd it had something it shouldn't have.

1979
02:07:53,370 --> 02:07:55,570
Wait, told Jowd it did something it shouldn't have.

1980
02:07:56,010 --> 02:07:57,370
Made an impossible move.

1981
02:07:58,290 --> 02:07:59,170
Lantua, like liquid.

1982
02:07:59,330 --> 02:08:00,190
Oh, thank you, guys.

1983
02:08:00,250 --> 02:08:00,550
Thank you.

1984
02:08:02,870 --> 02:08:03,970
They said it's an elf.

1985
02:08:04,210 --> 02:08:05,470
Thank you!

1986
02:08:06,730 --> 02:08:09,530
I added that part to the device I recreated.

1987
02:08:10,410 --> 02:08:14,830
I put in a part that would allow Cupid to rotate, otherwise
the gun wouldn't fire.

1988
02:08:15,870 --> 02:08:18,610
So that must mean somebody manipulated Camilla's
contraption.

1989
02:08:19,950 --> 02:08:24,370
As a result, we proved to ourselves that the manipulator
actually existed.

1990
02:08:26,110 --> 02:08:26,430
Mmm...

1991
02:08:26,750 --> 02:08:27,350
Lynn!

1992
02:08:28,470 --> 02:08:29,430
Inspector Cabanilla!

1993
02:08:32,230 --> 02:08:33,230
Hey, baby.

1994
02:08:38,410 --> 02:08:40,970
Oh my god, he's so awesome.

1995
02:08:41,950 --> 02:08:43,010
Sorry about that phone call.

1996
02:08:43,590 --> 02:08:45,150
I must have sounded like a real villain.

1997
02:08:45,710 --> 02:08:46,690
He's so smooth.

1998
02:08:46,890 --> 02:08:48,430
I know, my gosh.

1999
02:08:49,410 --> 02:08:51,310
I hate it to spoil your image of me.

2000
02:08:52,550 --> 02:08:55,150
Of that cool cat inspector you always looked up to.

2001
02:08:56,330 --> 02:08:57,710
Is that really the image she had of him?

2002
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:08,400
Inspector Cabanilla.

2003
02:09:08,840 --> 02:09:09,260
I'm sorry.

2004
02:09:09,480 --> 02:09:10,140
I just heard.

2005
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:12,400
You were chasing after that man all this time.

2006
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:14,240
time to try and help Detective Jowd.

2007
02:09:18,060 --> 02:09:20,240
This manipulator is such a dangerous character.

2008
02:09:20,940 --> 02:09:22,600
I was hoping you didn't have to be involved.

2009
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:24,700
Oh, I just bit my tongue.

2010
02:09:29,710 --> 02:09:30,150
Ow.

2011
02:09:35,070 --> 02:09:37,690
So that's why you have me arrested tonight, isn't it?

2012
02:09:39,670 --> 02:09:44,370
Like I always say, if somebody's in the way, throw them in
the slammer.

2013
02:09:45,690 --> 02:09:46,090
Yikes.

2014
02:09:47,670 --> 02:09:49,430
Get out of my way, Lynn.

2015
02:09:51,670 --> 02:09:52,090
Mm-hmm.

2016
02:09:53,270 --> 02:09:53,990
Rip mint.

2017
02:09:54,410 --> 02:09:56,390
Yeah, I've been ripped a long time.

2018
02:09:57,550 --> 02:09:58,970
I've been ripped for a while now.

2019
02:09:59,530 --> 02:10:00,050
Thanks, though.

2020
02:10:00,450 --> 02:10:01,010
Oh, Raiders!

2021
02:10:01,430 --> 02:10:01,990
Thank you!

2022
02:10:03,590 --> 02:10:03,990
Alien!

2023
02:10:04,970 --> 02:10:06,570
I couldn't catch the rest of it, but thank you!

2024
02:10:06,850 --> 02:10:07,570
Thanks for the raid!

2025
02:10:08,170 --> 02:10:08,490
Hello.

2026
02:10:08,910 --> 02:10:13,310
If you have never played Ghost Trick, you're probably going
to be kind of lost.

2027
02:10:13,650 --> 02:10:19,870
And if you plan on playing Ghost Trick, Uh, uh, this is
spoilers, I think.

2028
02:10:22,010 --> 02:10:23,110
But, uh, thanks for the rating!

2029
02:10:23,430 --> 02:10:23,990
Thank you!

2030
02:10:25,610 --> 02:10:27,330
Murphy, thanks for the 10 gift.

2031
02:10:27,550 --> 02:10:28,450
Thank you, thank you.

2032
02:10:28,870 --> 02:10:30,710
White on white text, I know.

2033
02:10:32,650 --> 02:10:33,070
Tonight.

2034
02:10:35,970 --> 02:10:36,490
Tonight.

2035
02:10:37,590 --> 02:10:39,710
I'm gonna die in your arms.

2036
02:10:40,530 --> 02:10:40,750
Wait.

2037
02:10:41,870 --> 02:10:42,250
Wait.

2038
02:10:42,570 --> 02:10:43,750
I think I got it wrong.

2039
02:10:46,550 --> 02:10:47,790
Ducky, thanks for the gifted.

2040
02:10:48,530 --> 02:10:49,970
Brunk for Robin, thanks for the five gifted.

2041
02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:56,030
I really thought we finally had him, but my body gave out on
me right at the critical moment.

2042
02:10:56,950 --> 02:10:58,130
It's like a cruel joke.

2043
02:10:58,710 --> 02:11:00,010
Whoa, ha, ha, ha.

2044
02:11:01,030 --> 02:11:02,710
But a joke is a joke.

2045
02:11:03,010 --> 02:11:04,290
You might as well laugh.

2046
02:11:05,250 --> 02:11:05,570
Jowd.

2047
02:11:06,730 --> 02:11:08,910
The minister called off the execution order.

2048
02:11:09,810 --> 02:11:13,430
And while he was at it, he let Detective Jowd go free until
tomorrow morning, too.

2049
02:11:15,470 --> 02:11:18,250
That's a pretty extreme while he was at it.

2050
02:11:20,790 --> 02:11:24,050
The Chad is here with his massive chin.

2051
02:11:25,990 --> 02:11:27,550
Sorry, I took so long to get here.

2052
02:11:27,690 --> 02:11:28,970
Yeah, I kept you waiting, huh?

2053
02:11:29,790 --> 02:11:31,370
You can leave the rest of me.

2054
02:11:32,350 --> 02:11:33,310
There you go again.

2055
02:11:33,490 --> 02:11:34,810
You've always been like that.

2056
02:11:35,630 --> 02:11:39,350
You make everybody else run around and then you swoop in at
the last second.

2057
02:11:40,630 --> 02:11:40,990
Chowd.

2058
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:46,480
He kept his coat!

2059
02:11:47,680 --> 02:11:52,260
Five years ago, you left this coat with me just before you
turned yourself in.

2060
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:55,260
I promise to give it back to you one day.

2061
02:11:56,240 --> 02:11:56,780
The pigeon!

2062
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:57,800
Pigeon delivery!

2063
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:02,300
What the?

2064
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:04,420
He's still in his prison clothes.

2065
02:12:05,480 --> 02:12:06,760
He's in his little onesie.

2066
02:12:09,340 --> 02:12:11,960
I've been waiting so long, Detective Jowd.

2067
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:14,160
We are so back.

2068
02:12:14,820 --> 02:12:15,920
Look how cool he looks.

2069
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:17,580
I'm waiting for this day to come.

2070
02:12:19,580 --> 02:12:21,440
Thanks for not giving up on me, Lin.

2071
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:24,700
Okay, I'm off then.

2072
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:27,020
Good luck, my old friend.

2073
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:31,260
Yeah, prison onesie!

2074
02:12:33,640 --> 02:12:34,160
Yeah!

2075
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:36,620
Hypnosis!

2076
02:12:37,260 --> 02:12:38,820
Oh, this present you gave me.

2077
02:12:39,120 --> 02:12:39,960
It's just what I needed.

2078
02:12:40,400 --> 02:12:41,020
Thank you.

2079
02:12:41,700 --> 02:12:42,980
Glad you like it.

2080
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:48,620
They don't even look at each other when they send you.

Okay, fine.

I'm counting on you.

2090
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:30,900
This true self you're looking for.

2091
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:32,880
I bet you'll find it soon.

2092
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:34,780
Aw.

2093
02:13:35,060 --> 02:13:36,820
Alright, I'm leaving, Inspector Cabanella.

2094
02:13:40,740 --> 02:13:41,900
It's almost on.

2095
02:13:42,460 --> 02:13:43,780
I'm not who I thought I was.

2096
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:46,080
I'm actually further from knowing who I am than ever.

2097
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:47,940
But now I don't feel so alone.

2098
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:48,680
Yeah.

2099
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:50,340
Oh yeah, they didn't disconnect, they're right.

2100
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:53,760
Just got major snoss a lot.

2101
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:58,860
Snoss a lot vibes.

2102
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:05,180
Why do you think I like Cicil and Inspector Cabanela?

2103
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:10,420
Snoss a lot works though.

2104
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:11,300
Snodicon?

2105
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:15,380
Snodicon for these two is Snoss a lot for Inspector Cabanela
and Cicil.

2106
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:18,320
I mistype.

2107
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:23,640
of us for his or her own reasons is looking for the truth.

2108
02:14:24,340 --> 02:14:27,340
Together, I think we can shed light on these mysteries and
drive away the darkness.

2109
02:14:27,860 --> 02:14:28,680
But it's almost dawn.

2110
02:14:28,860 --> 02:14:30,020
This one's a long chapter.

2111
02:14:30,180 --> 02:14:30,780
Two hours.

2112
02:14:31,240 --> 02:14:31,240
Wow.

2113
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:35,460
We're gonna be in it tonight, you guys.

2114
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:38,040
Maybe I should have started sooner.

2115
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:42,860
This is my formal apology for thinking Cabanilla is one of
the blue guys last stream.

2116
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:45,700
He's now just below missile and coolness.

2117
02:14:45,820 --> 02:14:46,360
I agree.

2118
02:14:46,740 --> 02:14:47,520
I agree, David.

2119
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:51,640
but it's just black.

2120
02:14:53,020 --> 02:14:54,060
There's nothing...

2121
02:14:54,060 --> 02:14:55,500
Oh, wait, I see what it is.

2122
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:56,240
I think.

2123
02:14:56,760 --> 02:14:58,140
It's, um...

2124
02:14:58,140 --> 02:14:59,540
I think it's the sidebars.

2125
02:15:00,100 --> 02:15:00,880
Oh, neat!

2126
02:15:01,620 --> 02:15:01,800
Oh!

2127
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:02,620
Oh!

2128
02:15:05,260 --> 02:15:06,300
Ghost trick!

2129
02:15:07,980 --> 02:15:08,940
Langering death.

2130
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:10,080
Did you guys like the thumbnail?

2131
02:15:10,700 --> 02:15:13,800
I even, like, manipulated my body so that...

2132
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:18,940
so that it even matched the way the thumbnail looked in the,
or the portrait in the game.

2133
02:15:21,320 --> 02:15:25,360
Oh, the submarine.

2134
02:15:26,700 --> 02:15:27,840
Oh, Cecil!

2135
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:30,400
Okay, saving.

2136
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:32,680
Manipulator?

2137
02:15:34,680 --> 02:15:35,380
Oh, my gosh.

2138
02:15:36,220 --> 02:15:38,100
Maybe I do have the ghost trick powers.

2139
02:15:39,400 --> 02:15:40,240
Continue playing.

2140
02:15:47,560 --> 02:15:50,120
Go men for backseating.

2141
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:54,160
Cats, but IBD is sometimes as easy as Prudhubu.

2142
02:15:56,820 --> 02:15:59,240
I'll forget to vet.

2143
02:15:59,620 --> 02:16:02,720
IBD worsens not improves for everyone with this issue.

2144
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:03,880
You know what?

2145
02:16:04,520 --> 02:16:05,760
I'm not going to lie.

2146
02:16:07,320 --> 02:16:13,840
When I got her, I thought that when she had her first
pooping episode, I was like, I wonder if she has IBS.

2147
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:18,300
I don't know what IBD is, but I'll look into it.

2148
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:24,040
And don't apologize for...

2149
02:16:28,200 --> 02:16:29,520
for trying to help.

2150
02:16:29,640 --> 02:16:30,520
I really appreciate it.

2151
02:16:34,740 --> 02:16:36,580
Your inflammatory bowel disease.

2152
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:37,820
I wonder, is that it?

2153
02:16:39,220 --> 02:16:40,580
Irritable boob syndrome?

2154
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:41,380
No!

2155
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:43,500
Is she throwing up?

2156
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:44,560
No, not at all.

2157
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:46,580
No throwing up.

2158
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:47,800
Oh, she threw up once.

2159
02:16:48,020 --> 02:16:50,900
The first time I got her, but I think that was because she
was stressed.

2160
02:16:53,560 --> 02:16:55,260
Call it hot girl tummy problems.

2161
02:16:56,280 --> 02:16:59,560
All hot girls have IBS.

2162
02:17:00,820 --> 02:17:04,800
It's because God had to nerf them a little bit.

2163
02:17:05,420 --> 02:17:09,300
They had to have IBS because they're too hot.

2164
02:17:10,380 --> 02:17:11,720
I'd be shit in IBS.

2165
02:17:13,700 --> 02:17:16,900
All hot girls have IBS.

2166
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:20,240
I'm a hot girl.

2167
02:17:20,720 --> 02:17:20,720
Woo!

2168
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:24,580
Sasaki syndrome.

2169
02:17:25,880 --> 02:17:27,000
And what do you know?

2170
02:17:27,320 --> 02:17:28,000
He's hot.

2171
02:17:29,700 --> 02:17:30,500
He's hot.

2172
02:17:32,780 --> 02:17:34,060
There has to be something wrong with you.

2173
02:17:34,220 --> 02:17:35,840
You can't just be hot and normal, okay?

2174
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:38,060
What a nerve.

2175
02:17:39,960 --> 02:17:41,220
I don't have IVS.

2176
02:17:42,300 --> 02:17:43,260
I don't have IVS.

2177
02:17:45,620 --> 02:17:48,140
Lynn kept her promise about getting me hooked up.

2178
02:17:48,320 --> 02:17:50,700
About two hours before dawn, the phone rang.

2179
02:17:51,060 --> 02:17:51,800
Two hours?

2180
02:17:51,900 --> 02:17:52,420
That's it.

2181
02:17:53,020 --> 02:17:53,740
Oh gosh.

2182
02:17:56,600 --> 02:17:57,780
Ring-a-ling-a-ling!

2183
02:17:58,920 --> 02:18:01,180
Ring-a- Sorry.

2184
02:18:02,100 --> 02:18:04,000
I like almost hiccuped.

2185
02:18:05,720 --> 02:18:06,440
This is Jowd.

2186
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:07,640
Cicil, are you listening?

2187
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:08,660
We need your powers.

2188
02:18:09,060 --> 02:18:09,700
No time to talk.

2189
02:18:09,820 --> 02:18:11,160
We'll be waiting for you.

2190
02:18:13,460 --> 02:18:13,780
Okay.

2191
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:15,060
Is that why Johnny's hot?

2192
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:15,780
Yes.

2193
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:18,840
Look at him.

2194
02:18:18,880 --> 02:18:20,900
What is this look on the doctor?

2195
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:22,360
What is this look on his face?

2196
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:23,200
Look at it.

2197
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:24,900
What is this look on your face?

2198
02:18:26,660 --> 02:18:28,580
Oh, are you looking at me?

2199
02:18:29,960 --> 02:18:31,340
Well, you better get going.

2200
02:18:31,680 --> 02:18:32,480
He's talking to me.

2201
02:18:33,940 --> 02:18:35,840
This long night is drawing to an end.

2202
02:18:37,140 --> 02:18:38,100
Yeah, it looks like it.

2203
02:18:39,060 --> 02:18:40,220
Thank you for all your help tonight.

2204
02:18:41,480 --> 02:18:43,040
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

2205
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:46,360
The bird bowed at me.

2206
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:52,280
At the other end of the phone line, I'm finally going to
find all my answers.

2207
02:18:52,600 --> 02:18:53,220
I'd better go.

2208
02:18:54,840 --> 02:18:55,620
Fourth wall break.

2209
02:18:55,640 --> 02:18:58,560
He looked directly at my soul.

2210
02:18:59,060 --> 02:19:00,120
I mean, I am a soul.

2211
02:19:00,780 --> 02:19:01,500
That's why I know.

2212
02:19:02,940 --> 02:19:07,620
So that's why you jeans oh fiber, fiber, what are you
talking about?

2213
02:19:07,860 --> 02:19:09,480
What are you talking about, Misfits?

2214
02:19:10,420 --> 02:19:13,200
A single telephone line connects me and the other sisal.

2215
02:19:13,800 --> 02:19:17,720
But that single line spreads out like a spider's web to
instare the fates of many people.

2216
02:19:20,440 --> 02:19:21,400
How'd they get in?

2217
02:19:21,780 --> 02:19:23,900
When I just reached the center of the web.

2218
02:19:28,940 --> 02:19:29,940
Whoa!

2219
02:19:36,860 --> 02:19:40,460
Fiber, fiber, fiber, fiber, fiber, fiber.

2220
02:19:40,460 --> 02:19:41,580
Eat more fiber.

2221
02:19:42,780 --> 02:19:44,840
Welcome to the Yonoa.

2222
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:48,020
Detective Jowd.

2223
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:49,300
Oh!

2224
02:19:51,140 --> 02:19:53,700
How did he get in here?

2225
02:19:54,660 --> 02:19:56,560
How did you get in here?

2226
02:19:57,540 --> 02:19:59,300
Did you swim here?

2227
02:19:59,740 --> 02:20:00,180
Detective!

2228
02:20:01,960 --> 02:20:04,520
My detective sense must have gotten rusty.

2229
02:20:05,020 --> 02:20:06,940
I didn't even sense your presence here in the dark.

2230
02:20:07,580 --> 02:20:08,460
He's just that good.

2231
02:20:08,980 --> 02:20:12,940
That's because I switched the power to my mask off,
Detective Jowd.

2232
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:15,960
I used your phone.

2233
02:20:16,340 --> 02:20:17,580
Hope you don't mind.

2234
02:20:18,940 --> 02:20:20,040
B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Bam.

2235
02:20:24,690 --> 02:20:27,250
You think he slaps asses like that machine?

2236
02:20:28,310 --> 02:20:29,010
Hey, God!

2237
02:20:29,310 --> 02:20:33,270
Never thought you'd track us here, especially seeing as you
are a death row window.

2238
02:20:33,290 --> 02:20:33,550
mate.

2239
02:20:34,990 --> 02:20:37,510
And I'm equally surprised about your choice of
transportation.

2240
02:20:37,950 --> 02:20:38,910
A submarine, eh?

2241
02:20:40,350 --> 02:20:41,670
No, he's a gentleman.

2242
02:20:43,330 --> 02:20:45,230
But how did you find us, my man?

2243
02:20:45,990 --> 02:20:49,530
Not even the police knew where the Yonoa was going to
surface.

2244
02:20:49,910 --> 02:20:50,410
Confounded?

2245
02:20:50,590 --> 02:20:51,890
Oh, it surfaced!

2246
02:20:52,750 --> 02:20:54,290
We detectives have a little saying.

2247
02:20:54,870 --> 02:20:58,550
If there's something you want to know about a case, ask the
criminals.

2248
02:21:07,100 --> 02:21:08,620
When did he...

2249
02:21:09,140 --> 02:21:16,380
The bullet the man in red was shot with had a radio
transmitter in it.

2250
02:21:17,080 --> 02:21:17,540
What?

2251
02:21:22,120 --> 02:21:24,640
I have a little something for you.

2252
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:26,020
And it's the pocket watch.

2253
02:21:26,480 --> 02:21:28,120
Is it actually like a...

2254
02:21:32,750 --> 02:21:35,230
Oh my god, it's a dragon ball scouter.

2255
02:21:36,650 --> 02:21:37,930
Oh my god!

2256
02:21:39,510 --> 02:21:42,530
Cabanella has given me some pretty weird presence in the
past.

2257
02:21:43,250 --> 02:21:44,590
But they always prove useful.

2258
02:21:45,110 --> 02:21:48,090
This one was a radio receiver made to look like a pocket
watch.

2259
02:21:49,090 --> 02:21:49,650
Birkenstel!

2260
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:51,810
Welcome to membership, thank you!

2261
02:21:52,770 --> 02:21:55,630
Hmm, yes, Inspector Cabanella.

2262
02:21:56,070 --> 02:21:58,010
I hear he's an excellent investigator.

2263
02:22:00,130 --> 02:22:02,550
By the way, where is that man in red?

2264
02:22:03,350 --> 02:22:05,690
I know he's on this submarine somewhere.

2265
02:22:06,370 --> 02:22:08,490
That's an Ocelot move for real.

2266
02:22:10,050 --> 02:22:12,320
Oh, ah, sisal you mean?

2267
02:22:22,320 --> 02:22:25,560
I've been here the whole time.

2268
02:22:29,580 --> 02:22:31,540
Oh my god, that's so funny.

2269
02:22:33,880 --> 02:22:34,720
You can relax.

2270
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:36,540
That's nothing but his shell.

2271
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:38,280
YouTube dying tonight.

2272
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:39,680
Uh-oh, I hope everything's okay.

2273
02:22:41,380 --> 02:22:42,320
His shell, eh?

2274
02:22:43,440 --> 02:22:45,080
His spirit isn't here right now.

2275
02:22:45,580 --> 02:22:47,000
Most likely right about now.

2276
02:22:47,960 --> 02:22:49,640
controlling your daughter.

2277
02:22:54,140 --> 02:22:56,000
Please, I beg you, let my daughter go.

2278
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:57,980
If you need a hostage, take me.

2279
02:22:58,260 --> 02:22:59,560
Just please, let her go.

2280
02:23:00,480 --> 02:23:00,700
Bah.

2281
02:23:02,480 --> 02:23:04,480
There's something our nation needs.

2282
02:23:05,120 --> 02:23:05,860
Cicel has it.

2283
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:07,840
That's all we care about, my man.

2284
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:09,080
Nothing else matters.

2285
02:23:09,640 --> 02:23:10,740
However, it would appear.

2286
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:12,900
Cicel has underestimated us.

2287
02:23:13,360 --> 02:23:16,440
He's left behind his precious bargaining chip here.

2288
02:23:18,020 --> 02:23:19,220
bargaining chip.

2289
02:23:19,820 --> 02:23:20,960
Oh, us!

2290
02:23:21,260 --> 02:23:21,880
Oh, just kidding.

2291
02:23:26,890 --> 02:23:27,830
It's me.

2292
02:23:28,090 --> 02:23:31,510
I'm the... I thought he was gonna go and, like, suck me
down.

2293
02:23:33,470 --> 02:23:35,750
Our nation has already researched it.

2294
02:23:36,050 --> 02:23:38,230
This product that Cicil has to offer.

2295
02:23:39,230 --> 02:23:39,750
The meteor.

2296
02:23:40,550 --> 02:23:42,190
The source of his powers.

2297
02:23:43,230 --> 02:23:43,890
Bip, bip, bip, bip.

2298
02:23:44,290 --> 02:23:44,690
Slap.

2299
02:23:49,540 --> 02:23:51,260
Whoa, that's a hunk of chunk.

2300
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:52,960
Wowee!

2301
02:23:53,900 --> 02:23:54,500
Oh!

2302
02:23:56,680 --> 02:23:58,800
It's ours now, or it's theirs, I guess.

2303
02:23:59,460 --> 02:23:59,700
What?

2304
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:01,360
What in the world was that?

2305
02:24:02,700 --> 02:24:03,940
The Temsic fragment.

2306
02:24:04,720 --> 02:24:06,640
It gives spirits special powers.

2307
02:24:08,620 --> 02:24:12,860
And now our deal with Cicil is concluded, as far as we're
concerned.

2308
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:14,860
What are you talking about?

2309
02:24:15,880 --> 02:24:19,500
What a mistake to make.

2310
02:24:21,860 --> 02:24:25,960
Right, at the most crucial moment.

2311
02:24:26,660 --> 02:24:28,020
Now then, Detective Jowd!

2312
02:24:30,980 --> 02:24:31,860
Farewell.

2313
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:35,620
Slap!

2314
02:24:37,640 --> 02:24:38,100
Oh!

2315
02:24:41,180 --> 02:24:42,060
Uh...

2316
02:24:43,810 --> 02:24:44,990
What?

2317
02:24:47,130 --> 02:24:48,530
What in the world?

2318
02:24:49,090 --> 02:24:50,470
The whole room just vanished!

2319
02:24:50,930 --> 02:24:51,790
Detective Jowd!

2320
02:24:52,210 --> 02:24:53,010
Where did he go?

2321
02:24:55,570 --> 02:24:56,090
Where?

2322
02:24:57,890 --> 02:25:02,210
Oh, because the table moved, the telephone went down there?

2323
02:25:02,390 --> 02:25:03,810
Oh gosh, what's going on?

2324
02:25:04,170 --> 02:25:04,910
Why is there a basketball?

2325
02:25:05,930 --> 02:25:06,570
What now?

2326
02:25:06,970 --> 02:25:08,490
I think I heard an explosion somewhere.

2327
02:25:08,730 --> 02:25:12,750
Oh, that means we'll probably have to switch things with
a...

2328
02:25:12,750 --> 02:25:15,130
With missile again.

2329
02:25:15,570 --> 02:25:18,210
In any case, Lynn and the little lady should be here
somewhere.

2330
02:25:18,730 --> 02:25:19,470
I smell danger.

2331
02:25:19,810 --> 02:25:20,730
I'd better find them.

2332
02:25:20,970 --> 02:25:21,850
And fast!

2333
02:25:22,730 --> 02:25:23,190
Trigger.

2334
02:25:26,590 --> 02:25:28,110
Who is this?

2335
02:25:30,470 --> 02:25:31,590
So you're here, huh?

2336
02:25:32,450 --> 02:25:33,490
It's Missou!

2337
02:25:34,730 --> 02:25:34,990
Woo!

2338
02:25:38,150 --> 02:25:41,370
Yes, I think you and I remember who you are by now.

2339
02:25:43,490 --> 02:25:44,370
It's Minto!

2340
02:25:46,350 --> 02:25:48,650
What do you suppose that shock was a minute ago?

2341
02:25:49,330 --> 02:25:50,710
I have no idea, of course!

2342
02:25:51,370 --> 02:25:53,410
I'm just a little sheltered apartment dog!

2343
02:25:54,890 --> 02:25:56,710
What with my memory, loss of memory?

2344
02:25:57,070 --> 02:25:58,570
I can't say much, I'm much better.

2345
02:25:59,930 --> 02:26:03,230
Anyway, let's hurry up and go save Miss Lin and Miss
Camilla.

2346
02:26:04,810 --> 02:26:07,350
Do you think that trusty nose of yours can sniff them out?

2347
02:26:08,470 --> 02:26:09,350
It's Mintolo!

2348
02:26:12,090 --> 02:26:14,050
I'm sorry to say I don't think it can.

2349
02:26:15,070 --> 02:26:16,410
Did I even bother to ask?

2350
02:26:17,490 --> 02:26:19,610
But you do have the power to swap objects.

2351
02:26:20,090 --> 02:26:23,290
So let's find that lady detective and that little lady
together.

2352
02:26:24,890 --> 02:26:27,030
I got it!

2353
02:26:30,500 --> 02:26:31,140
Ringling!

2354
02:26:31,940 --> 02:26:32,680
Are those missiles?

2355
02:26:33,460 --> 02:26:35,680
I think, uh, are those missiles, missile?

2356
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:41,380
I'm gonna put mint on my shower speakers.

2357
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:44,620
Have a nice shower!

2358
02:26:46,740 --> 02:26:47,880
The telephone is ringing.

2359
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:49,920
Wow!

2360
02:26:50,780 --> 02:26:53,260
It's Miss Camilla, I just know it!

2361
02:26:54,340 --> 02:26:57,200
My trusty nose is practically screaming it at me!

2362
02:26:57,220 --> 02:27:00,320
I think you'd call that more of a hunch.

2363
02:27:02,100 --> 02:27:04,420
Anyway, let's get to the phone before it stops ringing.

2364
02:27:04,900 --> 02:27:06,020
Those are torpedoes.

2365
02:27:06,200 --> 02:27:06,860
I guess you're right.

2366
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:09,000
You bet.

2367
02:27:10,380 --> 02:27:11,500
Trick time.

2368
02:27:13,240 --> 02:27:13,780
Let's see.

2369
02:27:14,200 --> 02:27:15,520
Oh, that's where Missile is.

2370
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:18,220
I can't reach anywhere else, so we're gonna...

2371
02:27:18,900 --> 02:27:20,300
We're gonna...

2372
02:27:20,300 --> 02:27:21,120
Num, num, num.

2373
02:27:22,460 --> 02:27:23,300
What is this?

2374
02:27:23,400 --> 02:27:24,360
Emergency light.

2375
02:27:25,940 --> 02:27:26,500
Can Missile...

2376
02:27:26,500 --> 02:27:27,040
Oh, hello!

2377
02:27:27,220 --> 02:27:28,480
Hello, Miss Camilla!

2378
02:27:29,060 --> 02:27:29,500
Hello!

2379
02:27:30,880 --> 02:27:32,640
I don't think he can pick up the phone.

2380
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:35,260
It's no use!

2381
02:27:35,860 --> 02:27:38,920
This black hello just doesn't like me!

2382
02:27:39,320 --> 02:27:39,500
What?

2383
02:27:40,740 --> 02:27:42,700
Just create a path for me, Missal.

2384
02:27:42,860 --> 02:27:43,800
I'll come right over.

2385
02:27:46,280 --> 02:27:46,920
Okay.

2386
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:51,220
What do I need to switch?

2387
02:27:53,620 --> 02:27:54,260
No.

2388
02:27:57,310 --> 02:28:12,150
I could switch the aversion lights but it doesn't really do
much maybe if i switch oh okay he's so cute i know it's just

2389
02:28:12,150 --> 02:28:29,570
this precious little guy and switch switcheroo there we go
oh oh oh oh i think i just heard another the distance.

2390
02:28:30,250 --> 02:28:31,930
I've got a bad feeling about this.

2391
02:28:33,010 --> 02:28:33,430
Cicel, look!

2392
02:28:35,410 --> 02:28:37,530
That black hello, it came off the hook!

2393
02:28:39,230 --> 02:28:41,830
Uh-oh, I better answer it fast!

2394
02:28:44,290 --> 02:28:45,730
Meow, meow, meow!

2395
02:28:46,590 --> 02:28:46,930
Easy.

2396
02:28:48,050 --> 02:28:48,570
Hello!

2397
02:28:49,110 --> 02:28:50,310
Is anybody there?

2398
02:28:50,990 --> 02:28:52,270
It's her, the little lady.

2399
02:28:52,850 --> 02:28:53,990
It's Cicel, where are you?

2400
02:28:54,790 --> 02:28:56,170
Somebody please answer!

2401
02:28:56,850 --> 02:28:58,390
I guess she can't hear my voice.

2402
02:28:59,550 --> 02:29:00,830
You too, huh?

2403
02:29:01,150 --> 02:29:01,610
Oh, good.

2404
02:29:01,870 --> 02:29:03,370
I thought she was ignoring me.

2405
02:29:04,370 --> 02:29:05,150
Somebody help me.

2406
02:29:05,690 --> 02:29:06,110
Lin...

2407
02:29:06,110 --> 02:29:06,650
Uh-oh.

2408
02:29:07,230 --> 02:29:08,970
It's been a while since Lin's died.

2409
02:29:09,570 --> 02:29:10,250
She said, Lin.

2410
02:29:11,370 --> 02:29:12,330
Miss Lin!

2411
02:29:12,970 --> 02:29:13,950
We'd better hurry.

2412
02:29:14,470 --> 02:29:15,170
Let's go, Sissel.

2413
02:29:16,450 --> 02:29:17,490
Go there.

2414
02:29:19,510 --> 02:29:22,250
It's been a real long time since Lin's died.

2415
02:29:22,650 --> 02:29:23,030
Oh, wait, no.

2416
02:29:23,090 --> 02:29:23,650
She's not dead.

2417
02:29:23,890 --> 02:29:24,810
Oh, wait a second.

2418
02:29:24,930 --> 02:29:25,530
Maybe she is dead.

2419
02:29:27,890 --> 02:29:28,950
Her body is not dead.

2420
02:29:28,970 --> 02:29:30,610
yellow though

2421
02:29:34,610 --> 02:29:42,630
but she's kind of like I thought she was just like leaning
over like the staircase but um uh oh are we gonna have like

2422
02:29:42,630 --> 02:29:44,690
Titanic our way out of here oh no

2423
02:29:48,540 --> 02:30:04,260
it's no use nobody's answering oh Camilla Miss Miss Camilla
and Miss Miss Lynn!

2424
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:06,520
Oh poor Miss Lynn!

2425
02:30:07,620 --> 02:30:09,340
Yeah, she can't seem to catch a break.

2426
02:30:10,280 --> 02:30:11,960
Looks like another tragedy has happened.

2427
02:30:13,240 --> 02:30:14,740
Sorry to keep you waiting a little.

2428
02:30:16,300 --> 02:30:17,200
Little lady.

2429
02:30:18,060 --> 02:30:19,600
Sissy, I knew you'd come.

2430
02:30:20,840 --> 02:30:21,360
Miss Camilla!

2431
02:30:21,680 --> 02:30:22,760
Miss Camilla!

2432
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:24,440
And Missle too!

2433
02:30:24,540 --> 02:30:25,940
I'm so glad to see you're all right.

2434
02:30:27,380 --> 02:30:28,060
All right.

2435
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:31,820
Well, I wouldn't say I'm all right exactly.

2436
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:35,160
Hey, wait a minute.

2437
02:30:35,900 --> 02:30:36,620
Missile, your voice.

2438
02:30:37,240 --> 02:30:39,060
I think I remember hearing it somewhere before.

2439
02:30:40,260 --> 02:30:40,380
What?

2440
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:41,320
My voice?

2441
02:30:42,500 --> 02:30:43,180
That's right.

2442
02:30:43,340 --> 02:30:48,700
Camilla has a core now, so that means she did hear Missile's
voice before when he saved her that time.

2443
02:30:49,880 --> 02:30:51,420
Just that was you, wasn't it, Missile?

2444
02:30:51,860 --> 02:30:54,120
You're the one who saved me in the park tonight.

2445
02:30:55,700 --> 02:30:56,480
Thank you.

2446
02:30:57,060 --> 02:31:01,060
Miss Camilla, I'm so glad I was born your little doggy.

2447
02:31:07,390 --> 02:31:08,650
think about my Oshis.

2448
02:31:09,110 --> 02:31:14,910
I'm so glad I was born to die to become your own, to become
a fan of you.

2449
02:31:18,850 --> 02:31:22,490
Hey, Missa, could you stay here and watch over your mistress
for a while?

2450
02:31:23,190 --> 02:31:23,630
Huh?

2451
02:31:24,490 --> 02:31:25,870
But don't you need my powers?

2452
02:31:27,110 --> 02:31:28,750
I'll see what I can do on my own for a while.

2453
02:31:30,410 --> 02:31:32,530
After all, you're the only one who can protect her.

2454
02:31:34,510 --> 02:31:35,970
Okay, I'll do it!

2455
02:31:36,310 --> 02:31:41,930
I love I love my soul.

2456
02:31:47,030 --> 02:31:49,810
I wonder what happened this time.

2457
02:31:50,370 --> 02:31:52,290
I better talk to the little lady more.

2458
02:31:52,470 --> 02:31:56,970
I wonder if she got electrocuted from the water.

2459
02:31:57,170 --> 02:31:58,810
I'd better do something about the detective lady.

2460
02:32:01,030 --> 02:32:03,250
Oh, oh, uh, turn it.

2461
02:32:06,390 --> 02:32:06,950
Okay.

2462
02:32:09,690 --> 02:32:17,350
I'm happy you died to become my Yoshi Did you have to censor
it because YouTube I appreciate it

2463
02:32:20,890 --> 02:32:26,230
I'm glad I died too then Oh sisal you're here

2464
02:32:29,250 --> 02:32:39,970
Lynn what in the world happened here I don't know I just
sort of blacked out all of a sudden I know I was dead!

2465
02:32:42,210 --> 02:32:43,630
Yeah, I guess you wouldn't know in that case.

2466
02:32:43,790 --> 02:32:44,610
You guys...

2467
02:32:46,170 --> 02:32:48,330
I think I have to go to the little ghosties room.

2468
02:32:52,540 --> 02:32:54,400
I think I have to go to the ghosties room.

2469
02:32:56,320 --> 02:33:00,920
I can't believe in the two and a half hours I've left the
stream three times.

2470
02:33:01,900 --> 02:33:02,780
That's insane.

2471
02:33:03,240 --> 02:33:04,240
That never happens.

2472
02:33:05,620 --> 02:33:06,720
I won't allow you.

2473
02:33:07,480 --> 02:33:07,920
Please!

2474
02:33:08,340 --> 02:33:09,800
I prefer you dead ghost.

2475
02:33:13,320 --> 02:33:15,540
That's because I have two drinks.

2476
02:33:19,510 --> 02:33:23,030
Okay, you can listen to this bop and soundtrack and I'll be
right back.

2477
02:33:25,230 --> 02:33:27,130
I'm sorry, I just have to pee.

2478
02:33:28,390 --> 02:33:30,030
I have to expel the ectoplasm.

2479
02:33:30,690 --> 02:33:32,350
Actually, that's not a good way to say that.

2480
02:33:32,490 --> 02:33:33,050
You know what?

2481
02:36:32,970 --> 02:36:45,630
Oh my god, when I opened the door, when I opened the door to
leave, um Paz came like running at me and she was like She

2482
02:36:45,630 --> 02:36:55,950
kept chirping at me And then she was following me And I fed
her I fed her When I went to go get the water earlier So So

2483
02:36:55,950 --> 02:37:02,670
I know she wasn't hungry I think she was like Lethargic all
day Or it's like she slept all day Because I had to give her

2484
02:37:02,670 --> 02:37:11,430
a bath earlier And I think it made her really tired I think
I gave her a bath earlier From the poop And She slept all

2485
02:37:11,430 --> 02:37:16,850
day, she was just sad about it And now she's all like happy
She even followed me into the bathroom One thing I really

2486
02:37:16,850 --> 02:37:23,510
love about her One thing that I think is the cutest thing
about her Is she's a plopper Like she doesn't just like lay

2487
02:37:23,510 --> 02:37:33,430
down normally She just like she goes like Plop She's so cute
So like She even followed me into the bathroom And was just

2488
02:37:33,430 --> 02:37:39,370
like La la la Hello Hello Hello mom And then she just
plopped on the ground.

2489
02:37:39,710 --> 02:37:41,210
She's so cute.

2490
02:37:43,850 --> 02:37:45,130
She's so cute.

2491
02:37:45,370 --> 02:37:46,030
Does she spread out?

2492
02:37:46,130 --> 02:37:46,670
Yes, she does.

2493
02:37:46,850 --> 02:37:47,350
She bananas.

2494
02:37:48,030 --> 02:37:49,150
She turns into a banana.

2495
02:37:51,210 --> 02:37:52,990
She's a plopper in more ways than one.

2496
02:37:53,190 --> 02:37:53,970
I hate that.

2497
02:37:54,950 --> 02:37:56,350
I hate that so much.

2498
02:37:56,750 --> 02:37:57,750
She's really sweet.

2499
02:37:57,890 --> 02:37:59,050
I really love her.

2500
02:37:59,650 --> 02:38:00,130
I do.

2501
02:38:00,730 --> 02:38:01,610
I hope she's okay.

2502
02:38:02,190 --> 02:38:03,430
It makes stresses me out.

2503
02:38:04,030 --> 02:38:06,430
Me wondering if she's...

2504
02:38:07,130 --> 02:38:15,550

i don't know what we're talking about oh uh about how she

2507
02:38:34,830 --> 02:38:37,690

2508
02:38:37,850 --> 02:38:38,350
Yeah.

2509
02:38:42,050 --> 02:38:45,230
Now it's all making even less sense than before.

2510
02:38:48,590 --> 02:38:49,690
Oh, give me one second.

2511
02:38:50,490 --> 02:38:52,550
Let me check something on my phone.

2512
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:13,840
Uh, what is, wait.

2513
02:39:14,140 --> 02:39:15,260
Oh, never mind, okay.

2514
02:39:15,800 --> 02:39:16,560
I'm good, I'm good.

2515
02:39:17,340 --> 02:39:17,800
Everything okay?

2516
02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:19,060
Yep, all good.

2517
02:39:19,740 --> 02:39:22,960
After we left the super's office, we followed after the man
in red.

2518
02:39:24,040 --> 02:39:31,280
We tracked him with that radio transmitter and Spectre
Calvonella fired into him with the bullet.

2519
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:37,760
The man in red took a boat out to sea from a small harbor on
the edge of town.

2520
02:39:40,380 --> 02:39:43,840
Detective Jowd and I managed to secretly stow away on his
boat.

2521
02:39:45,260 --> 02:39:48,640
And then we sneaked onto the submarine with him when it
surfaced.

2522
02:39:50,900 --> 02:39:53,640
Before long, the submarine dove back down again.

2523
02:39:54,160 --> 02:39:55,460
Oh, so that's how.

2524
02:39:55,580 --> 02:39:57,160
Okay, I was like, how did you...

2525
02:39:57,160 --> 02:39:59,380
Okay, thank you for the...

2526
02:39:59,380 --> 02:40:03,160
Thank you for the explanation of how he got down there under
the water.

2527
02:40:03,780 --> 02:40:04,520
Under the sea.

2528
02:40:04,940 --> 02:40:06,680
Detective Jowden and I decided to split up.

2529
02:40:07,300 --> 02:40:09,780
He would take care of the telephone line and I would look
for Camilla.

2530
02:40:11,940 --> 02:40:14,480
I found Camilla hiding here in the engine room.

2531
02:40:14,660 --> 02:40:16,320
She had escaped and run away here.

2532
02:40:17,680 --> 02:40:19,000
Do, do, do, do, do.

2533
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:20,560
Babe.

2534
02:40:21,020 --> 02:40:22,140
Wow, that's quite an adventure.

2535
02:40:22,540 --> 02:40:23,120
What happened next?

2536
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:25,460
I don't know.

2537
02:40:25,680 --> 02:40:25,780
Huh?

2538
02:40:26,760 --> 02:40:28,200
There was a flash of white all of a sudden.

2539
02:40:28,400 --> 02:40:29,540
Next thing I know I was dead!

2540
02:40:29,740 --> 02:40:31,720
Okay, she definitely got electrocuted, I think.

2541
02:40:32,900 --> 02:40:36,280
Oh boy, it sounds like it'd be quicker for me to see for
myself.

2542
02:40:37,840 --> 02:40:39,860
Oh, time to rewind.

2543
02:40:42,700 --> 02:40:44,140
Maybe from the water.

2544
02:40:47,380 --> 02:40:48,700
Yes, you know.

2545
02:40:50,140 --> 02:40:51,460
Camilla, are you okay?

2546
02:40:57,310 --> 02:40:57,790
Wow!

2547
02:40:58,130 --> 02:40:59,090
Oh, my God.

2548
02:40:59,530 --> 02:41:00,170
Camilla?

2549
02:41:01,650 --> 02:41:02,390
Oh, no.

2550
02:41:04,290 --> 02:41:04,930
Oh, no!

2551
02:41:05,130 --> 02:41:06,250
She's getting manipulated!

2552
02:41:09,290 --> 02:41:09,610
Ah.

2553
02:41:10,910 --> 02:41:11,610
Hello, Lynn.

2554
02:41:12,290 --> 02:41:14,090
Or is it detective now?

2555
02:41:14,730 --> 02:41:16,910
It's been 10 years since we last met.

2556
02:41:23,340 --> 02:41:24,620
Are you...

2557
02:41:24,620 --> 02:41:27,180
Are you really that man from the park 10 years?

2558
02:41:27,200 --> 02:41:42,160
ago well well I see there's no need to introduce myself give
Camilla back she has nothing to do with any of this afraid I

2559
02:41:42,160 --> 02:41:54,040
can't do that this is my last chance look at the sass the
hand on the hip the phone is ringing it's not for me nobody

2560
02:41:54,040 --> 02:41:55,280
ever calls the dead.

2561
02:41:57,760 --> 02:41:58,000
Yo!

2562
02:41:59,220 --> 02:42:00,460
Single-handedly!

2563
02:42:02,100 --> 02:42:06,980
The fact that you're here means that my revenge plan has
failed.

2564
02:42:08,360 --> 02:42:08,980
Revenge plan?

2565
02:42:09,900 --> 02:42:11,760
It didn't happen tonight, did it?

2566
02:42:12,540 --> 02:42:13,400
His execution.

2567
02:42:17,380 --> 02:42:20,600
Well, knowing him, they have expected as much.

2568
02:42:21,740 --> 02:42:23,360
That's why I was waiting here like this.

2569
02:42:24,280 --> 02:42:25,060
him to show up.

2570
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:26,740
Ta-da!

2571
02:42:28,300 --> 02:42:33,500
Wouldn't it be just what he wanted to be executed by his own
daughter?

2572
02:42:38,450 --> 02:42:40,050
I heard about 10 years ago.

2573
02:42:42,030 --> 02:42:42,850
Oh, wait, wait.

2574
02:42:43,070 --> 02:42:44,390
I heard about 10 years ago.

2575
02:42:44,890 --> 02:42:46,490
I feel sorry about what happened to you.

2576
02:42:47,370 --> 02:42:48,190
But revenge?

2577
02:42:49,370 --> 02:42:49,770
Hmm.

2578
02:42:51,630 --> 02:42:54,770
Nobody could possibly know what I've...

2579
02:42:54,770 --> 02:42:55,270
Oh!

2580
02:42:58,550 --> 02:42:59,450
What in the world?

2581
02:42:59,610 --> 02:43:00,090
An explosion?

2582
02:43:01,670 --> 02:43:02,210
Uh-oh.

2583
02:43:02,510 --> 02:43:04,790
I've got a bad feeling about this.

2584
02:43:06,470 --> 02:43:08,070
Have I been had?

2585
02:43:10,350 --> 02:43:11,450
Look out!

2586
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:17,680
Oh.

2587
02:43:19,060 --> 02:43:19,900
Revenge, huh?

2588
02:43:20,780 --> 02:43:22,520
That's a feeling I just can't understand.

2589
02:43:23,920 --> 02:43:24,600
Of course not.

2590
02:43:24,940 --> 02:43:25,600
You're not him.

2591
02:43:27,320 --> 02:43:28,180
She's right.

2592
02:43:28,520 --> 02:43:29,660
I'm not him, am I?

2593
02:43:30,660 --> 02:43:32,580
He was going to shoot Detective Jowd.

2594
02:43:33,300 --> 02:43:35,980
That's Camilla, when he came to rescue her.

2595
02:43:36,900 --> 02:43:37,880
It's just too horrible.

2596
02:43:39,860 --> 02:43:42,640
Anyway, let's bring you back to life again.

2597
02:43:44,060 --> 02:43:46,240
He didn't have to add the again part.

2598
02:43:48,180 --> 02:43:48,660
Okay.

2599
02:43:49,480 --> 02:43:50,940
How do we stop this?

2600
02:43:52,180 --> 02:43:52,660
How?

2601
02:43:54,360 --> 02:43:55,140
Trick time.

2602
02:43:55,300 --> 02:43:56,120
How do we stop this?

2603
02:43:58,040 --> 02:43:58,700
So let's see.

2604
02:43:58,780 --> 02:44:02,880
The cause of death this time was the mysterious experience.

2605
02:44:03,300 --> 02:44:03,700
explosion

2606
02:44:06,800 --> 02:44:09,060
You're pretty up for a dead woman

2607
02:44:13,300 --> 02:44:15,560
You know how detectives love a good mystery.

2608
02:44:15,980 --> 02:44:20,240
It's like a shot of vitamins And what do you mean for a dead
woman?

2609
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:24,860
Do you guys think that I'm energetic for being so dead?

2610
02:44:26,940 --> 02:44:30,420
I guess we should look and look for a way to stop that
explosion.

2611
02:44:31,180 --> 02:44:47,820
Okay, let's do this thing finding clues is like a dose of
minerals to a detective quite very yeah you're quite lively

2612
02:44:47,820 --> 02:44:58,560
I'm afraid with my memory loss I have no idea what vitamins
or minerals rocks fossils rocks rocks and minerals are you

2613
02:44:58,560 --> 02:45:13,960
okay let's see what do we have oh oh yes this whole this
whole scenario let's see oh i can't get to anywhere i am

2614
02:45:13,960 --> 02:45:18,570
trapped we have to wait for her to move the gun

2615
02:45:27,310 --> 02:45:39,390
i think yeah we still can't do anything wait can i switch to
no i can't switch to um But also, if I can't switch the...

2616
02:45:39,390 --> 02:45:44,590
I wouldn't be able to switch things anyway, I think, because
the ghost...

2617
02:45:45,190 --> 02:45:46,030
Cicil would notice.

2618
02:45:47,730 --> 02:45:49,250
No one calls for the dead.

2619
02:45:49,370 --> 02:45:49,470
Oh!

2620
02:45:50,550 --> 02:45:52,090
And here we go.

2621
02:45:52,990 --> 02:45:53,870
Trick time!

2622
02:46:01,470 --> 02:46:02,970
Wait, but who's calling?

2623
02:46:08,850 --> 02:46:10,210
I can't get the line to work.

2624
02:46:10,330 --> 02:46:10,710
That's funny.

2625
02:46:10,810 --> 02:46:13,310
I thought I could use the phone in the past if somebody was
calling.

2626
02:46:13,530 --> 02:46:13,810
Yeah!

2627
02:46:14,590 --> 02:46:15,770
What are you talking about?

2628
02:46:16,050 --> 02:46:18,030
The receiver has to be off the hook first, silly.

2629
02:46:19,190 --> 02:46:19,370
Oh.

2630
02:46:20,410 --> 02:46:21,330
Well, don't look at me.

2631
02:46:21,470 --> 02:46:22,190
I can't do it.

2632
02:46:22,410 --> 02:46:24,130
I don't have any hands or feet right now.

2633
02:46:24,930 --> 02:46:26,370
Somebody, please answer the phone.

2634
02:46:26,890 --> 02:46:28,450
If you want something done, you have to do it yourself.

2635
02:46:29,810 --> 02:46:30,190
Okay.

2636
02:46:31,110 --> 02:46:32,730
Let's go up here.

2637
02:46:36,130 --> 02:46:38,090
This is an emergency light.

2638
02:46:40,210 --> 02:46:41,890
What does turning this do?

2639
02:46:44,790 --> 02:46:45,190
Mm-hmm.

2640
02:46:47,110 --> 02:46:47,990
Uh-huh.

2641
02:46:48,690 --> 02:46:49,530
This is the phone.

2642
02:46:49,890 --> 02:46:51,890
Oh, what about turning this, too?

2643
02:46:52,370 --> 02:46:53,270
Let's turn this.

2644
02:46:53,690 --> 02:46:54,550
Turn, turn, turn.

2645
02:46:54,690 --> 02:46:56,570
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2646
02:46:58,150 --> 02:46:59,130
That's what that did.

2647
02:46:59,910 --> 02:47:01,650
Anyway, somehow managed to knock down the receiver.

2648
02:47:01,930 --> 02:47:05,550
That, I'm kind of concerned about the condition of this
submarine.

2649
02:47:07,270 --> 02:47:08,150
Somehow managed.

2650
02:47:08,430 --> 02:47:10,050
Who's to say that's not how I planned it?

2651
02:47:10,770 --> 02:47:11,370
Come on, hurry.

2652
02:47:11,710 --> 02:47:12,890
Now's your chance to get on the phone.

2653
02:47:13,410 --> 02:47:14,450
It might be Detective Jowd.

2654
02:47:15,390 --> 02:47:15,970
She's right.

2655
02:47:16,050 --> 02:47:16,950
I'd better check it out.

2656
02:47:22,690 --> 02:47:26,730
Using the new episode of the podcast to power me through
finding a different job.

2657
02:47:27,570 --> 02:47:33,490
Funny that a ghost is helping me quit the job of Woods Gnome
encouraged me to pass the interview.

2658
02:47:38,740 --> 02:47:39,740
I mean...

2659
02:47:41,760 --> 02:47:42,260
Um...

2660
02:47:42,260 --> 02:47:43,100
You know what?

2661
02:47:43,100 --> 02:47:45,700
I think the Woods Gnome...

2662
02:47:45,700 --> 02:47:48,140
Probably didn't know what they were talking about.

2663
02:47:49,060 --> 02:47:49,880
And you know what?

2664
02:47:50,320 --> 02:47:53,100
Just like I came back, there were changes.

2665
02:47:53,740 --> 02:47:55,560
You can do changes too.

2666
02:47:56,220 --> 02:47:56,580
You know?

2667
02:47:57,600 --> 02:47:58,060
Yeah.

2668
02:48:05,540 --> 02:48:06,880
Quit your job.

2669
02:48:07,700 --> 02:48:10,610
And I'll encourage you for the next one.

2670
02:48:14,580 --> 02:48:15,240
Hello.

2671
02:48:15,700 --> 02:48:16,540
Anybody there?

2672
02:48:17,480 --> 02:48:20,020
If anybody's still there, get yourself here on the double.

2673
02:48:20,360 --> 02:48:21,500
We're about to head out.

2674
02:48:24,280 --> 02:48:35,060
you answer anyway come on if you're coming we're leaving oh
i guess i better go there because they're leaving get gnomed

2675
02:48:35,060 --> 02:48:49,480
silly hmm so i have to delay them leaving because that's the
explosion so it might be true what they say that there are

2676
02:48:49,480 --> 02:48:56,100
restless ghosts on board whoa creepy Okay, we're back here.

2677
02:48:56,660 --> 02:48:57,220
That does it.

2678
02:48:57,360 --> 02:48:59,500
I promise to turn over a new leaf, Mom.

2679
02:49:01,340 --> 02:49:02,540
Wait, don't leave!

2680
02:49:06,360 --> 02:49:08,220
Who is he calling restless ghosts?

2681
02:49:08,500 --> 02:49:08,800
Yeah!

2682
02:49:09,100 --> 02:49:10,600
Who is he calling restless...

2683
02:49:10,600 --> 02:49:12,880
Who is he calling restless ghosts?

2684
02:49:14,460 --> 02:49:14,840
Hmm.

2685
02:49:16,540 --> 02:49:19,680
Well, it's true neither of us is really resting in peace.

2686
02:49:21,460 --> 02:49:21,780
Anyway.

2687
02:49:22,620 --> 02:49:24,480
Looks like the sub just lost one of its crew.

2688
02:49:25,520 --> 02:49:28,740
I guess that means the fate of this sub has changed
slightly.

2689
02:49:31,300 --> 02:49:32,180
Okay, nice.

2690
02:49:34,720 --> 02:49:36,420
Cicil has underestimated us.

2691
02:49:36,520 --> 02:49:39,060
He's left behind his precious bargaining chip here.

2692
02:49:39,220 --> 02:49:42,040
Ah, okay, this is when they take the stone.

2693
02:49:45,100 --> 02:49:46,440
Okay, there goes the phone.

2694
02:49:47,840 --> 02:49:48,700
Detective Jowd.

2695
02:49:48,960 --> 02:49:49,900
What's going on there?

2696
02:49:50,260 --> 02:49:52,620
I saw this little deal go down once before.

2697
02:49:53,260 --> 02:49:56,560
In just a moment, the man in red is about to get his Temsik
fragment.

2698
02:49:56,580 --> 02:50:11,040
fragment taken away okay so do I have to go up there what's
happening they decided to conclude the deal without the

2699
02:50:11,040 --> 02:50:24,040
other party present they're just going to go ahead and steal
the Temsic fragment but that's that's cheating I think we

2700
02:50:24,040 --> 02:50:29,340
have more important things to think about right now Where's
the Temsic fragment going to go?

2701
02:50:30,600 --> 02:50:31,660
True, true, true.

2702
02:50:34,460 --> 02:50:35,000
Uh...

2703
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,500
If I open this...

2704
02:50:37,500 --> 02:50:37,780
Boink!

2705
02:50:38,180 --> 02:50:38,260
Oh!

2706
02:50:42,260 --> 02:50:42,800
Uh...

2707
02:50:42,800 --> 02:50:43,800
Wait, um...

2708
02:50:45,800 --> 02:50:46,760
Okay, hold on.

2709
02:50:47,120 --> 02:50:47,660
Open...

2710
02:50:47,660 --> 02:50:49,540
And go!

2711
02:50:50,320 --> 02:50:50,860
Now!

2712
02:50:53,440 --> 02:50:54,520
Oh, I'm stuck.

2713
02:50:56,220 --> 02:50:57,960
Wait, wait, I'm gonna be stuck, though.

2714
02:50:58,860 --> 02:50:59,800
What's this valve do?

2715
02:51:00,620 --> 02:51:01,600
Eep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep,
peep, peep, peep, peep.

2716
02:51:03,280 --> 02:51:05,740
Oh, oh, there it goes, there it goes, there it goes.

2717
02:51:07,020 --> 02:51:08,020
And up, is it easy?

2718
02:51:08,640 --> 02:51:09,660
Oh my god.

2719
02:51:13,440 --> 02:51:15,260
Why are there so many men in the submarine?

2720
02:51:18,800 --> 02:51:20,420
The Temsic fragment.

2721
02:51:23,060 --> 02:51:24,440
The objective has been achieved.

2722
02:51:24,940 --> 02:51:26,900
Now we detach the control room as planned.

2723
02:51:27,640 --> 02:51:28,080
Yes, sir.

2724
02:51:28,420 --> 02:51:29,160
Farewell, sir.

2725
02:51:31,640 --> 02:51:33,640
Yeah, it's like a clown car for real.

2726
02:51:33,660 --> 02:51:34,600
clown sub.

2727
02:51:37,860 --> 02:51:38,600
Sissel, what just happened?

2728
02:51:38,940 --> 02:51:41,500
The whole room just disappeared with Detective Jowd in it.

2729
02:51:42,880 --> 02:51:43,500
Don't worry, Lin.

2730
02:51:44,960 --> 02:51:46,900
I bet Detective Jowd can take care of himself.

2731
02:51:47,660 --> 02:51:50,260
The main thing right now is rescuing you and the little
lady.

2732
02:51:51,760 --> 02:51:53,340
I can't believe this is happening.

2733
02:51:54,540 --> 02:51:59,840
Now then, I'd better hurry along before Sissel discovers
what he's lost and comes after me.

2734
02:52:00,540 --> 02:52:02,340
The Yanoa will be his coffin.

2735
02:52:03,740 --> 02:52:04,540
Oh!

2736
02:52:08,280 --> 02:52:11,140
May it lie buried here in the deep sea.

2737
02:52:13,160 --> 02:52:14,880
Farewell, sisal.

2738
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:19,940
There he goes.

2739
02:52:20,120 --> 02:52:22,100
Oh, and that's why the water starts to rise too.

2740
02:52:22,780 --> 02:52:23,140
I think?

2741
02:52:25,140 --> 02:52:26,580
These poor guys.

2742
02:52:30,380 --> 02:52:30,820
Oh!

2743
02:52:33,240 --> 02:52:34,620
There he goes.

2744
02:52:35,100 --> 02:52:36,080
Taking off.

2745
02:52:38,520 --> 02:52:38,960
Hmm.

2746
02:52:40,320 --> 02:52:43,720
Oh, so that's the cause of that giant explosion.

2747
02:52:44,460 --> 02:52:46,960
I think we probably gotta get the little handle thing down
there, right?

2748
02:52:47,340 --> 02:52:47,800
What is?

2749
02:52:48,840 --> 02:52:50,700
Don't tell me that's another thing you've forgotten.

2750
02:52:51,400 --> 02:52:52,240
The torpedo!

2751
02:52:52,900 --> 02:52:55,540
It's like, well, you've heard of a missile before, haven't
you?

2752
02:52:56,280 --> 02:52:57,020
Yeah, the dog.

2753
02:52:57,940 --> 02:53:00,040
But a different missile comes more readily to mind.

2754
02:53:01,380 --> 02:53:03,980
It looks like he plans to sink the submarine with that
thing.

2755
02:53:07,260 --> 02:53:09,460
just not let it rise to the surface.

2756
02:53:10,800 --> 02:53:14,300
All you have to do is just let it sit at the bottom, right?

2757
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:16,420
This is not good.

2758
02:53:17,120 --> 02:53:19,480
We have to do something before that torpedo is fired!

2759
02:53:22,560 --> 02:53:24,160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2760
02:53:25,220 --> 02:53:25,580
Uh...

2761
02:53:25,580 --> 02:53:26,140
Lower!

2762
02:53:27,220 --> 02:53:28,140
It won't budge.

2763
02:53:28,240 --> 02:53:28,980
Maybe it's broken.

2764
02:53:29,560 --> 02:53:31,560
Oh, well, I guess I don't have to lower it right now.

2765
02:53:32,600 --> 02:53:35,420
And even if I had to move it, I could probably get Lynn to
do it for me.

2766
02:53:35,760 --> 02:53:37,200
Oh, what are you talking about?

2767
02:53:37,260 --> 02:53:38,380
What about this one?

2768
02:53:41,980 --> 02:53:42,700
Nothing's happening.

2769
02:53:45,240 --> 02:53:46,040
You're done goofed?

2770
02:53:46,140 --> 02:53:46,440
Uh-oh.

2771
02:53:47,860 --> 02:53:49,360
Sure seems like it should do something.

2772
02:53:49,900 --> 02:53:51,160
Maybe it's just some kind of ornament.

2773
02:53:53,300 --> 02:53:54,360
We can't let it launch.

2774
02:53:54,500 --> 02:53:55,400
I think it's launched.

2775
02:53:56,500 --> 02:53:57,660
I think it's launched.

2776
02:53:58,240 --> 02:53:58,980
What can we do?

2777
02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:01,380
Let's just get to the torpedo as fast as we can.

2778
02:54:01,920 --> 02:54:03,340
Maybe we can find a way to stop it somehow.

2779
02:54:04,060 --> 02:54:04,420
Somehow?

2780
02:54:04,980 --> 02:54:06,240
A true detective never gives up.

2781
02:54:07,260 --> 02:54:08,900
We certainly can't just ignore it.

2782
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:14,120
Oh, I think we've lost our chance.

2783
02:54:16,160 --> 02:54:17,420
What was my chance?

2784
02:54:17,540 --> 02:54:18,480
Was it with the rock?

2785
02:54:20,680 --> 02:54:21,160
Or...

2786
02:54:21,160 --> 02:54:25,240
Maybe when I launch this up, I attach myself to the rock?

2787
02:54:26,920 --> 02:54:27,400
Or...

2788
02:54:27,400 --> 02:54:29,480
I guess

2789
02:54:33,440 --> 02:54:34,580
we'll just see what happens.

2790
02:54:35,340 --> 02:54:36,460
It's gonna launch!

2791
02:54:37,780 --> 02:54:38,620
There's no use.

2792
02:54:38,700 --> 02:54:39,840
There's nothing we can do from here.

2793
02:54:40,720 --> 02:54:41,200
Okay.

2794
02:54:41,220 --> 02:54:42,000
Meaum!

2795
02:54:44,200 --> 02:54:44,900
Trick time.

2796
02:54:46,720 --> 02:54:47,080
Oh.

2797
02:54:48,040 --> 02:54:49,200
There goes the missile.

2798
02:54:50,340 --> 02:54:52,040
Now there's really nothing we can do.

2799
02:54:52,980 --> 02:54:54,780
If only our missile was here right now.

2800
02:54:55,620 --> 02:54:57,580
And bet he'd try to take it head on for us.

2801
02:54:58,440 --> 02:54:59,300
Yeah, I bet he would.

2802
02:54:59,860 --> 02:55:01,420
Looks like we better rethink this whole thing.

2803
02:55:02,980 --> 02:55:04,780
Okay, from the fate change.

2804
02:55:08,910 --> 02:55:10,750
There goes missile, but not the dog.

2805
02:55:15,110 --> 02:55:17,110
I think I have to attach myself to...

2806
02:55:18,990 --> 02:55:19,950
The rock.

2807
02:55:21,070 --> 02:55:21,350
Right?

2808
02:55:23,290 --> 02:55:25,110
When it gets...

2809
02:55:26,190 --> 02:55:26,830
Hold on.

2810
02:55:27,050 --> 02:55:27,830
Oh, I can't see it.

2811
02:55:27,890 --> 02:55:29,110
Okay, I wanted to see if I could...

2812
02:55:30,070 --> 02:55:30,470
Okay.

2813
02:55:31,610 --> 02:55:33,050
Grab the rock!

2814
02:55:34,190 --> 02:55:35,230
Eat it up!

2815
02:55:35,410 --> 02:55:35,570
Okay.

2816
02:55:36,310 --> 02:55:36,790
Now!

2817
02:55:37,730 --> 02:55:38,210
Uh...

2818
02:55:41,900 --> 02:55:42,860
I wonder...

2819
02:55:42,860 --> 02:55:43,460
Open!

2820
02:55:45,220 --> 02:55:46,580
I wonder if I'm timing this.

2821
02:55:48,880 --> 02:55:49,320
Correctly.

2822
02:55:49,520 --> 02:55:50,280
I don't think I did.

2823
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:52,460
Okay, one more.

2824
02:55:52,580 --> 02:55:52,980
One more.

2825
02:55:53,300 --> 02:55:54,340
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2826
02:55:56,600 --> 02:55:57,040
Uh...

2827
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:00,800
You can wait in the light.

2828
02:56:00,960 --> 02:56:01,780
Oh, that's right!

2829
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:02,680
You guys are so smart.

2830
02:56:07,740 --> 02:56:08,180
Wait!

2831
02:56:08,460 --> 02:56:08,900
No!

2832
02:56:10,140 --> 02:56:11,240
Oh gosh, oh gosh.

2833
02:56:11,360 --> 02:56:13,040
I missed my chance!

2834
02:56:14,580 --> 02:56:14,800
Oh!

2835
02:56:17,880 --> 02:56:18,320
Nice!

2836
02:56:18,320 --> 02:56:19,180
Never mind.

2837
02:56:19,320 --> 02:56:20,940
I didn't miss my chance.

2838
02:56:24,380 --> 02:56:26,420
Wait, if I'm here...

2839
02:56:27,440 --> 02:56:28,220
Oh, I'm in the capsule.

2840
02:56:28,440 --> 02:56:28,940
Okay, okay, okay.

2841
02:56:30,240 --> 02:56:31,000
La la la.

2842
02:56:31,500 --> 02:56:33,480
Whew, that was so close.

2843
02:56:34,280 --> 02:56:34,880
Clutch, man.

2844
02:56:35,300 --> 02:56:35,600
Clutch.

2845
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:39,300
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2846
02:56:40,200 --> 02:56:41,860
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

2847
02:56:50,330 --> 02:56:51,570
La la la la.

2848
02:56:52,990 --> 02:56:54,710
From the capsule, what can I do?

2849
02:56:57,010 --> 02:56:57,530
Hmm.

2850
02:56:58,650 --> 02:56:59,170
Hmm.

2851
02:57:00,050 --> 02:57:00,390
Hmm.

2852
02:57:01,210 --> 02:57:01,730
Hmm.

2853
02:57:06,400 --> 02:57:07,700
You caught the after image?

2854
02:57:07,860 --> 02:57:08,720
I'm just that good.

2855
02:57:09,360 --> 02:57:10,660
I'm just that good.

2856
02:57:16,990 --> 02:57:18,290
That's the cause.

2857
02:57:18,530 --> 02:57:20,210
Baa, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa.

2858
02:57:20,530 --> 02:57:21,430
Uh-oh.

2859
02:57:22,310 --> 02:57:23,030
Do something!

2860
02:57:23,730 --> 02:57:24,310
Is it the lever?

2861
02:57:26,330 --> 02:57:27,610
Perhaps it is?

2862
02:57:28,250 --> 02:57:29,290
Lower the lever.

2863
02:57:30,410 --> 02:57:31,150
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

2864
02:57:31,470 --> 02:57:32,310
Baa, baa, baa, baa, baa.

2865
02:57:33,750 --> 02:57:41,650
okay I'm inside wait that's not letting me do anything else
there's no time it's gonna launch we can still find a way to

2866
02:57:41,650 --> 02:57:47,910
stop it how even if the torpedo does launch we just have to
stop it from detonating right there's still something we can

2867
02:57:47,910 --> 02:58:01,690
do okay I hope why was the I hope at the end of the strong
at the end the strongest part of that sentence here goes oh

2868
02:58:01,690 --> 02:58:09,150
my god it Why is there a mouse in here?

2869
02:58:11,610 --> 02:58:13,710
Why is there a mouse in the torpedo?

2870
02:58:16,070 --> 02:58:17,330
How did you get in here?

2871
02:58:18,930 --> 02:58:21,830
I came along for the ride without giving it too much
thought.

2872
02:58:23,490 --> 02:58:24,790
Well, was this really the best move?

2873
02:58:25,470 --> 02:58:26,230
I think so.

2874
02:58:26,670 --> 02:58:28,470
We just have to keep it from going off, right?

2875
02:58:29,330 --> 02:58:30,090
Okay, mouse.

2876
02:58:31,190 --> 02:58:33,010
I'm sure this poor little rat will thank us too.

2877
02:58:33,110 --> 02:58:34,270
Sorry, I kept saying mouse.

2878
02:58:34,670 --> 02:58:35,470
a rat!

2879
02:58:37,650 --> 02:58:39,130
How in the world did it get in there?

2880
02:58:40,610 --> 02:58:40,810
Okay.

2881
02:58:42,810 --> 02:58:44,010
This game hates rats.

2882
02:58:45,530 --> 02:58:46,390
This game is...

2883
02:58:46,390 --> 02:58:49,790
Oh, I think these outside parts are supposed to be weights
of some sort.

2884
02:58:50,490 --> 02:58:51,690
Spending black things, right?

2885
02:58:52,390 --> 02:58:55,450
Apparently their spinning helps the torpedo maintain its
balance.

2886
02:58:56,030 --> 02:58:57,030
They must be pretty heavy.

2887
02:58:57,870 --> 02:59:00,270
I wonder if we can use these weights to our advantage
somehow.

2888
02:59:02,530 --> 02:59:03,050
Stop!

2889
02:59:04,050 --> 02:59:04,570
Uh...

2890
02:59:06,030 --> 02:59:17,990
operate operate okay let's examine the detonator this is
probably the detonator don't press it the torpedo will

2891
02:59:17,990 --> 02:59:27,770
explode uh oh better be careful but you know there should be
a safety device around here somewhere safety device huh that

2892
02:59:27,770 --> 02:59:37,630
sounds promising we have to put the safety on before this
thing blows up wait What's the audio or the dialogue here?

2893
02:59:38,570 --> 02:59:38,890
Press it.

2894
02:59:39,710 --> 02:59:41,510
Do you know how a torpedo works?

2895
02:59:42,310 --> 02:59:43,370
No, I can't say I do.

2896
02:59:43,770 --> 02:59:44,930
Wow, detectives sure know a lot.

2897
02:59:45,730 --> 02:59:47,010
I saw it explained once in a book.

2898
02:59:49,170 --> 02:59:50,610
On impact, the fuse in the...

2899
02:59:50,610 --> 02:59:52,210
Okay, someone tell me if this is accurate.

2900
02:59:52,390 --> 02:59:52,990
I'm so curious.

2901
02:59:53,890 --> 02:59:56,170
On impact, the fuse in the tip is depressed.

2902
02:59:57,190 --> 02:59:57,530
Uh-huh.

2903
03:00:00,090 --> 03:00:02,190
That, in turn, sets off the detonator.

2904
03:00:03,530 --> 03:00:03,950
Whoa.

2905
03:00:04,670 --> 03:00:05,730
The detonator, huh?

2906
03:00:06,170 --> 03:00:07,290
That must be the red button.

2907
03:00:07,970 --> 03:00:08,650
Kind of not a...

2908
03:00:08,650 --> 03:00:11,750
Wait, so there's like a tiny little red button inside a
torpedo?

2909
03:00:15,070 --> 03:00:17,270
Oh, this sounds so silly, though.

2910
03:00:18,930 --> 03:00:20,030
There it is, for real?

2911
03:00:21,970 --> 03:00:23,330
Probably won't be a button.

2912
03:00:29,950 --> 03:00:31,710
IRL torpedoes have rats in them, too.

2913
03:00:32,310 --> 03:00:32,510
Wow!

2914
03:00:38,520 --> 03:00:39,840
Some more of like an igniter.

2915
03:00:40,140 --> 03:00:41,160
Okay, that makes more sense.

2916
03:00:44,460 --> 03:00:46,080
So how do we stop it?

2917
03:00:46,620 --> 03:00:48,860
I didn't explain anything about that in the book.

2918
03:00:50,260 --> 03:00:51,260
Detectives sure know a lot.

2919
03:00:51,920 --> 03:00:52,840
Or not.

2920
03:00:53,800 --> 03:00:54,160
Okay.

2921
03:00:56,920 --> 03:00:58,500
Let's operate the joint.

2922
03:00:59,980 --> 03:01:00,360
Oh!

2923
03:01:00,960 --> 03:01:03,100
Oh my god.

2924
03:01:03,620 --> 03:01:06,060
This looks like just the thing.

2925
03:01:06,400 --> 03:01:09,960
If we clamp this thing on the fuse, it should keep it from
moving.

2926
03:01:11,080 --> 03:01:12,220
So what does that mean exactly?

2927
03:01:12,700 --> 03:01:13,460
It means we might be able to...

2928
03:01:13,480 --> 03:01:15,460
to stop the torpedo from exploding with this.

2929
03:01:16,140 --> 03:01:18,100
I have to admit, I don't understand all the details.

2930
03:01:18,700 --> 03:01:19,820
But I do want to give it a try.

2931
03:01:20,620 --> 03:01:24,800
Before we can do that, looks like we have to get something
out of the way first, huh?

2932
03:01:25,820 --> 03:01:27,020
Um, little rat.

2933
03:01:28,100 --> 03:01:28,660
Little rat.

2934
03:01:28,800 --> 03:01:28,960
Okay.

2935
03:01:29,440 --> 03:01:33,580
I think if we stop it in a certain way, it will fling the
rat.

2936
03:01:33,660 --> 03:01:35,000
He'll be either like, woo!

2937
03:01:35,400 --> 03:01:36,520
Or he'll be like, woo!

2938
03:01:37,080 --> 03:01:37,640
You know?

2939
03:01:39,300 --> 03:01:40,560
Let's try stopping this one.

2940
03:01:42,080 --> 03:01:42,740
Oh god.

2941
03:01:43,480 --> 03:01:43,960
Oh god!

2942
03:01:44,500 --> 03:01:45,600
Oh god, oh god.

2943
03:01:45,700 --> 03:01:47,080
Oh god, maybe I was wrong.

2944
03:01:51,780 --> 03:01:52,260
What?

2945
03:01:54,420 --> 03:01:56,140
How do I get you out of here?

2946
03:02:01,840 --> 03:02:02,260
Stop!

2947
03:02:04,180 --> 03:02:05,720
When I stop one...

2948
03:02:05,720 --> 03:02:06,060
Wait.

2949
03:02:06,420 --> 03:02:09,560
When I stop one, the other one starts.

2950
03:02:12,100 --> 03:02:12,980
Oh, wait a second.

2951
03:02:14,840 --> 03:02:15,080
Oh!

2952
03:02:15,420 --> 03:02:15,880
Oh!

2953
03:02:17,060 --> 03:02:18,720
Oh, I had to time it.

2954
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:19,580
Oh, there we go.

2955
03:02:19,800 --> 03:02:20,160
Oh, my God.

2956
03:02:21,620 --> 03:02:23,260
We've dumped the little creature off.

2957
03:02:23,840 --> 03:02:24,340
Okay.

2958
03:02:25,720 --> 03:02:28,240
Those weights were heavy enough to turn the whole torpedo
over.

2959
03:02:31,160 --> 03:02:32,940
I knew that was going to happen.

2960
03:02:35,200 --> 03:02:36,580
Now for that safety device.

2961
03:02:37,580 --> 03:02:37,600
Right.

2962
03:02:38,360 --> 03:02:38,940
Oh, my God.

2963
03:02:39,200 --> 03:02:39,460
Eum.

2964
03:02:39,800 --> 03:02:39,960
Eum.

2965
03:02:40,240 --> 03:02:40,500
Eum.

2966
03:02:41,400 --> 03:02:41,900
Operate.

2967
03:02:44,660 --> 03:02:45,160
There.

2968
03:02:45,260 --> 03:02:47,040
We clamped the safety device on.

2969
03:02:48,560 --> 03:02:56,620
I totally knew that was gonna happen I should keep this
torpedo from exploding But there's just one problem Problem?

2970
03:02:57,100 --> 03:02:57,660
What's that?

2971
03:02:58,240 --> 03:03:14,240
The torpedo is still going to impact We can't do anything
about that Uh-oh Oh Sasuga Tensai Minto Thank you Oh but it

2972
03:03:14,240 --> 03:03:17,380
didn't The explosion didn't happen so all the stuff didn't
come.

2973
03:03:18,300 --> 03:03:21,880
It didn't, like, come toppling down the ceiling and stuff.

2974
03:03:23,980 --> 03:03:25,920
It looks like the torpedo still hit the sub.

2975
03:03:27,120 --> 03:03:28,700
But it looks like the submarine is still...

2976
03:03:28,700 --> 03:03:29,120
Okay!

2977
03:03:30,320 --> 03:03:33,240
This changes everybody's fate, including the little rats.

2978
03:03:34,180 --> 03:03:35,720
Cicel, we did it!

2979
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:37,960
Fate averted.

2980
03:03:41,220 --> 03:03:41,920
What's the matter?

2981
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:42,980
You still look unhappy.

2982
03:03:44,100 --> 03:03:46,120
Crash is better than an explosion, exactly.

2983
03:03:46,140 --> 03:03:48,220
We stopped the torpedo from blowing up.

2984
03:03:49,780 --> 03:03:51,920
But we still opened up a gaping hole in the submarine.

2985
03:03:53,380 --> 03:03:53,860
You're right.

2986
03:03:54,380 --> 03:03:55,800
I guess...

2987
03:03:55,800 --> 03:03:58,340
I guess that's just what missiles do.

2988
03:03:58,700 --> 03:03:59,660
They're unstoppable!

2989
03:04:01,480 --> 03:04:02,420
Am I hearing things?

2990
03:04:03,240 --> 03:04:03,600
Anyway.

2991
03:04:04,360 --> 03:04:07,220
I guess we better get back to the present as quickly as we
can.

2992
03:04:08,780 --> 03:04:09,000
Right.

2993
03:04:09,100 --> 03:04:10,060
I'm worried about Camilla.

2994
03:04:10,920 --> 03:04:13,020
I think our best boy is talking.

2995
03:04:14,760 --> 03:04:15,300
Okay.

2996
03:04:16,140 --> 03:04:18,240
I think our best boy is hanging about.

2997
03:04:20,240 --> 03:04:23,700
We managed to stop death for now, but it hasn't disappeared
altogether.

2998
03:04:24,320 --> 03:04:26,560
It's now slowly but surely filling the room.

2999
03:04:27,100 --> 03:04:28,600
Oh, Titanic scary!

3000
03:04:30,180 --> 03:04:30,520
Uh-oh.

3001
03:04:31,120 --> 03:04:33,760
Water is seeping in through the hole where the torpedo hit!

3002
03:04:35,500 --> 03:04:36,880
I have to step out.

3003
03:04:37,320 --> 03:04:39,140
Here's an early congrats on reaching the end, Mint.

3004
03:04:39,240 --> 03:04:40,220
It was so fun to watch.

3005
03:04:40,820 --> 03:04:41,300
Poopy!

3006
03:04:41,780 --> 03:04:42,360
Thank you!

3007
03:04:43,200 --> 03:04:44,340
Thank you so much.

3008
03:04:48,180 --> 03:04:49,720
We've got to get them out of here.

3009
03:04:50,020 --> 03:04:51,160
I'd better go meet up with Lynn.

3010
03:04:53,100 --> 03:04:54,060
Trick drive.

3011
03:04:56,200 --> 03:04:57,680
I like this soundtrack too.

3012
03:04:57,840 --> 03:04:58,260
It's so cool.

3013
03:05:01,960 --> 03:05:02,440
Wheel.

3014
03:05:04,280 --> 03:05:05,100
Oh, what's this one doing?

3015
03:05:05,320 --> 03:05:05,560
Wheel.

3016
03:05:06,840 --> 03:05:07,320
Starter.

3017
03:05:08,940 --> 03:05:09,420
Transformer.

3018
03:05:09,520 --> 03:05:10,220
Medium fan.

3019
03:05:10,900 --> 03:05:12,560
I guess start whatever we're starting.

3020
03:05:14,780 --> 03:05:15,040
Oh!

3021
03:05:15,360 --> 03:05:15,640
Oh!

3022
03:05:17,280 --> 03:05:21,140
The lights went out, but this machine apparently still
works.

3023
03:05:23,100 --> 03:05:24,700
The ride only gets crazier from here?

3024
03:05:25,740 --> 03:05:27,640
Unfortunately, I guess it won't run for very long.

3025
03:05:27,800 --> 03:05:28,920
How much crazier can it get?

3026
03:05:29,760 --> 03:05:32,380
Maybe I can use its movements to help me create a path.

3027
03:05:37,380 --> 03:05:38,780
I'd better hurry over to Lin.

3028
03:05:39,020 --> 03:05:40,120
It's not safe to stay here.

3029
03:05:40,520 --> 03:05:43,900
I just don't have the power to stop that water from coming
in.

3030
03:05:45,320 --> 03:05:46,900
Wait, what did I change?

3031
03:05:49,140 --> 03:05:50,260
really change anything.

3032
03:05:53,400 --> 03:05:54,860
I don't think at least.

3033
03:05:55,280 --> 03:05:55,280
Oh!

3034
03:05:55,720 --> 03:05:57,120
That thing right there.

3035
03:06:00,750 --> 03:06:01,270
Let's...

3036
03:06:01,270 --> 03:06:03,070
Oh, uh...

3037
03:06:03,070 --> 03:06:04,730
Okay, can't do anything with the fans.

3038
03:06:06,390 --> 03:06:09,150
But I can...

3039
03:06:09,150 --> 03:06:10,550
Do this.

3040
03:06:11,250 --> 03:06:11,530
Oh.

3041
03:06:11,890 --> 03:06:12,770
A little bit.

3042
03:06:13,430 --> 03:06:13,950
There we go.

3043
03:06:14,110 --> 03:06:14,750
Oh my goodness.

3044
03:06:16,610 --> 03:06:17,430
There we go.

3045
03:06:17,590 --> 03:06:17,970
Okay.

3046
03:06:19,330 --> 03:06:19,910
Okay.

3047
03:06:23,670 --> 03:06:27,350
Wait, what can I do with this piston?

3048
03:06:28,530 --> 03:06:28,890
Uh-oh.

3049
03:06:30,450 --> 03:06:30,850
Oh!

3050
03:06:31,450 --> 03:06:32,210
Oh, it lifted up.

3051
03:06:32,310 --> 03:06:34,250
Oh, I thought I was trapped for a second for real.

3052
03:06:34,750 --> 03:06:35,870
Oh my gosh.

3053
03:06:37,810 --> 03:06:38,390
She cooking.

3054
03:06:41,990 --> 03:06:42,390
Camilla.

3055
03:06:43,210 --> 03:06:43,610
Lynn!

3056
03:06:44,530 --> 03:06:45,490
Camilla, you're awake!

3057
03:06:45,610 --> 03:06:46,270
How do you feel?

3058
03:06:46,930 --> 03:06:47,890
I'm so sorry.

3059
03:06:48,430 --> 03:06:50,010
I'm sorry I pointed that gun at you.

3060
03:06:50,890 --> 03:06:52,490
Wait, so she remembers it.

3061
03:06:54,730 --> 03:06:56,810
Camilla's been the manipulator this whole time.

3062
03:07:00,590 --> 03:07:02,010
Well, how do you remember that, huh, Camilla?

3063
03:07:04,050 --> 03:07:05,190
Don't worry about that.

3064
03:07:05,330 --> 03:07:06,430
That wasn't you.

3065
03:07:08,550 --> 03:07:09,430
Miss Camilla!

3066
03:07:10,590 --> 03:07:11,790
Oh, Missal, you're here.

3067
03:07:12,550 --> 03:07:13,710
Oh, poor Miss Camilla.

3068
03:07:14,210 --> 03:07:15,470
Miss Lynn, what should we do?

3069
03:07:17,310 --> 03:07:19,990
We have to get out of here before any more water comes in.

3070
03:07:22,050 --> 03:07:24,010
Cicil should be along any second.

3071
03:07:25,050 --> 03:07:26,210
I knew Cicil would come.

3072
03:07:26,890 --> 03:07:28,590
And Missy is here too.

3073
03:07:31,410 --> 03:07:33,990
I'm so happy everybody's going to be with me now.

3074
03:07:36,170 --> 03:07:36,950
Oh, dies.

3075
03:07:42,540 --> 03:07:43,160
Uh-oh.

3076
03:07:44,220 --> 03:07:45,480
God, I love that dog.

3077
03:07:45,640 --> 03:07:46,060
Me too.

3078
03:07:46,340 --> 03:07:47,360
I'll get you out of here.

3079
03:07:49,680 --> 03:07:51,120
If it's the last thing I do...

3080
03:07:51,120 --> 03:07:53,080
Don't say that, Lynn, because it might very well be...

3081
03:07:54,080 --> 03:07:55,180
I think I'm going to cry.

3082
03:07:56,340 --> 03:07:58,560
Or whimper, as the case may be.

3083
03:07:59,460 --> 03:08:01,060
I better send a signal to Lynn that I'm here.

3084
03:08:01,320 --> 03:08:02,260
Before it's too late.

3085
03:08:04,920 --> 03:08:05,160
Beep.

3086
03:08:05,940 --> 03:08:06,340
Beep.

3087
03:08:07,620 --> 03:08:07,940
It's me.

3088
03:08:08,580 --> 03:08:09,340
Look at that flashlight.

3089
03:08:10,280 --> 03:08:10,680
It's Cicel.

3090
03:08:10,860 --> 03:08:11,260
He's here.

3091
03:08:13,160 --> 03:08:14,680
That was a quick death flag.

3092
03:08:14,940 --> 03:08:15,680
Yeah, it was.

3093
03:08:19,380 --> 03:08:20,600
What if there's like a...

3094
03:08:20,600 --> 03:08:21,560
Can you imagine?

3095
03:08:21,660 --> 03:08:22,880
What if there's like a thing...

3096
03:08:22,880 --> 03:08:24,060
A puzzle that we can't...

3097
03:08:24,680 --> 03:08:25,960
Solve at some point.

3098
03:08:26,340 --> 03:08:27,000
That scares me.

3099
03:08:27,180 --> 03:08:31,220
What if, like, Lynn dies and we try to solve the puzzle and
she's like, There's no helping it.

3100
03:08:31,740 --> 03:08:33,060
It just has to be this way.

3101
03:08:34,100 --> 03:08:35,520
No, I don't want that to happen.

3102
03:08:37,280 --> 03:08:38,540
I'm glad you're here, Sissel.

3103
03:08:39,340 --> 03:08:40,080
Sorry for the wait.

3104
03:08:40,800 --> 03:08:43,020
It looks like this room is going to fill up with water fast.

3105
03:08:45,500 --> 03:08:48,420
We'd better get out that door as quick as we can.

3106
03:08:49,740 --> 03:08:51,300
We won't be getting out that door, I'm afraid.

3107
03:08:51,660 --> 03:08:53,260
The water pressure is too great already.

3108
03:08:53,380 --> 03:08:54,060
I can't open it.

3109
03:08:56,420 --> 03:08:58,720
what what does water pressure mean

3110
03:09:03,110 --> 03:09:11,430
think of it as the force of the water holding the door
closed sisal is so dumb i love this guy the water level

3111
03:09:11,430 --> 03:09:20,930
keeps getting higher and higher in here so the only way out
of here is up huh exactly okay got it let's look for a path

3112
03:09:20,930 --> 03:09:29,650
that goes up which i see one already right there oh you
missed it oh right there Look at that ladder.

3113
03:09:30,110 --> 03:09:32,730
I wonder if we can get it down somehow.

3114
03:09:33,830 --> 03:09:34,150
Good idea.

3115
03:09:34,490 --> 03:09:35,310
Let's try it.

3116
03:09:36,190 --> 03:09:36,750
What is water?

3117
03:09:38,550 --> 03:09:40,270
Oh, and by the way...

3118
03:09:42,010 --> 03:09:43,830
I can't swim.

3119
03:09:44,470 --> 03:09:45,430
Neither can Camilla.

3120
03:09:47,950 --> 03:09:48,990
Oh my god.

3121
03:09:49,730 --> 03:09:51,450
Don't you have any good news for me?

3122
03:09:52,830 --> 03:09:54,010
Let me think about it.

3123
03:09:54,190 --> 03:09:55,850
In the meantime, could you hurry, please?

3124
03:09:56,410 --> 03:10:00,730
Okay, I'm assuming...

3125
03:10:00,730 --> 03:10:02,590
I'm assuming...

3126
03:10:02,590 --> 03:10:04,990
I'm assuming this is time then.

3127
03:10:06,670 --> 03:10:07,990
What does this do?

3128
03:10:08,370 --> 03:10:08,370
Oh.

3129
03:10:09,550 --> 03:10:10,350
Uh...

3130
03:10:10,350 --> 03:10:11,730
Handle, turn the handle!

3131
03:10:14,890 --> 03:10:15,190
Oh!

3132
03:10:15,750 --> 03:10:16,090
Oh!

3133
03:10:19,280 --> 03:10:19,760
Okay.

3134
03:10:21,960 --> 03:10:22,900
Uh...

3135
03:10:22,900 --> 03:10:24,240
Let's see.

3136
03:10:25,260 --> 03:10:26,320
Switch lower.

3137
03:10:29,180 --> 03:10:29,700
Nice.

3138
03:10:32,420 --> 03:10:33,220
You did it, Sissel.

3139
03:10:34,900 --> 03:10:35,800
Fake Talibar.

3140
03:10:35,960 --> 03:10:36,880
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

3141
03:10:37,280 --> 03:10:38,340
Thank you so much.

3142
03:10:39,520 --> 03:10:40,960
Where's Raiden when you need him?

3143
03:10:41,220 --> 03:10:41,760
I know, right?

3144
03:10:42,040 --> 03:10:43,880
Listen to the sound of my heartbeat.

3145
03:10:45,220 --> 03:10:46,080
Or lack thereof.

3146
03:10:48,120 --> 03:10:48,940
Okay, we're here.

3147
03:10:49,540 --> 03:10:49,900
Nice.

3148
03:10:52,380 --> 03:10:52,700
Nice.

3149
03:10:52,820 --> 03:10:58,940
What was that?

3150
03:10:59,020 --> 03:11:02,740
It looks like water seeping in isn't the only thing we have
to worry about.

3151
03:11:03,420 --> 03:11:06,320
And I hope you can manage to avoid drowning for two cute
girls.

3152
03:11:06,880 --> 03:11:07,780
Leave it to me!

3153
03:11:11,060 --> 03:11:11,680
Uh-oh.

3154
03:11:12,460 --> 03:11:13,820
No, our flashlight!

3155
03:11:14,600 --> 03:11:16,100
The flashlight doesn't work anymore!

3156
03:11:17,100 --> 03:11:18,120
Hey, don't get mad at me.

3157
03:11:19,120 --> 03:11:21,420
Maybe the contacts are bad or something.

3158
03:11:22,440 --> 03:11:24,240
Hey, I know, you can fix it with your powers!

3159
03:11:24,880 --> 03:11:25,280
I...

3160
03:11:25,280 --> 03:11:27,100
Now that's just taking things too far.

3161
03:11:30,280 --> 03:11:43,460
okay wait can I actually turn it on oh it actually worked
did you used to be an electrician in your past life or

3162
03:11:43,460 --> 03:11:52,080
something that's a cruel question considering the
circumstances now all we have to do is get to that door and

3163
03:11:52,080 --> 03:11:59,640
we're safe oh oh oh Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my
god.

3164
03:11:59,860 --> 03:12:04,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

3165
03:12:04,660 --> 03:12:05,980
It's actually the Titanic.

3166
03:12:11,440 --> 03:12:12,440
Oh my god.

3167
03:12:17,390 --> 03:12:21,690
Listen to the sound of the no posters on my wall.

3168
03:12:21,830 --> 03:12:22,530
What does that mean?

3169
03:12:27,510 --> 03:12:29,090
What happened now?

3170
03:12:30,050 --> 03:12:33,310
Looks like the submarine decided to rear up on its hind
legs.

3171
03:12:35,050 --> 03:12:37,150
I can't believe we're still okay after that fall.

3172
03:12:37,610 --> 03:12:41,730
Oh, I mean, speak for yourself, but Camilla right there, she
looks like...

3173
03:12:41,730 --> 03:12:43,210
She doesn't look like she's doing so well.

3174
03:12:44,550 --> 03:12:47,410
Either we're really lucky or we're dead and we just haven't
realized it yet.

3175
03:12:48,230 --> 03:12:50,150
Come on now, as if the latter could be true.

3176
03:12:52,730 --> 03:12:53,610
Uh, Camilla!

3177
03:12:56,430 --> 03:12:57,510
Oh, no way.

3178
03:13:00,250 --> 03:13:01,050
Oh, now!

3179
03:13:01,590 --> 03:13:03,710
Oh, The water sure is rising fast!

3180
03:13:04,990 --> 03:13:07,890
Something's rising and it isn't the shield hero.

3181
03:13:08,890 --> 03:13:09,410
Come on!

3182
03:13:10,490 --> 03:13:11,170
Oh my god.

3183
03:13:11,450 --> 03:13:12,390
You'll just have to go up!

3184
03:13:12,570 --> 03:13:13,210
Up to the top!

3185
03:13:13,410 --> 03:13:14,270
But Kamua!

3186
03:13:14,830 --> 03:13:16,510
Let's see how I can help with my ghost tricks.

3187
03:13:20,010 --> 03:13:21,830
What are we gonna do with her?

3188
03:13:22,770 --> 03:13:24,850
I think I see a familiar flame over there.

3189
03:13:25,110 --> 03:13:25,630
Oh, oh.

3190
03:13:26,450 --> 03:13:26,890
Missa!

3191
03:13:27,370 --> 03:13:28,330
Cicel, there you are!

3192
03:13:29,070 --> 03:13:29,770
How's it going?

3193
03:13:32,050 --> 03:13:42,150
it going I'd say it was going pretty badly someday it'll be
the shield hero like you guys what's rising is the water

3194
03:13:42,150 --> 03:13:52,710
it's the water that's rising what else would I mean it's the
water see you do understand how dangerous the situation is

3195
03:13:52,710 --> 03:14:03,270
don't you oh the water of course after all just ask anybody
who knows me about how much I hate taking a bath.

3196
03:14:04,510 --> 03:14:06,070
Usually dogs like baths, though.

3197
03:14:12,890 --> 03:14:15,590
Have you guys ever met a dog that doesn't like a bath?

3198
03:14:16,970 --> 03:14:19,930
Maybe he's been in danger of drowning before himself.

3199
03:14:20,890 --> 03:14:21,070
Okay.

3200
03:14:21,650 --> 03:14:23,310
Ready to create a path for these ladies?

3201
03:14:24,150 --> 03:14:25,010
Of course!

3202
03:14:26,550 --> 03:14:27,070
Alright.

3203
03:14:27,690 --> 03:14:28,390
Trick time.

3204
03:14:30,030 --> 03:14:30,930
Let's see.

3205
03:14:32,130 --> 03:14:32,910
Oh, no.

3206
03:14:33,310 --> 03:14:33,910
Uh...

3207
03:14:36,190 --> 03:14:38,250
No, uh, I guess swap, sure.

3208
03:14:38,710 --> 03:14:38,930
Oh, wait.

3209
03:14:39,470 --> 03:14:41,190
Uh, let's see.

3210
03:14:41,470 --> 03:14:43,230
Where can we go to?

3211
03:14:44,310 --> 03:14:45,010
What can we...

3212
03:14:45,010 --> 03:14:45,590
Oh, my goodness.

3213
03:14:46,170 --> 03:14:48,110
Wow, there's a lot of stuff here.

3214
03:14:48,870 --> 03:14:49,570
Oh, my gosh.

3215
03:14:50,450 --> 03:14:52,170
Wait, there's so much stuff here.

3216
03:14:52,950 --> 03:14:55,210
Oh, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed with this one.

3217
03:14:56,650 --> 03:14:57,550
Oh, my God.

3218
03:14:58,090 --> 03:14:59,830
And we have to get all the way to the top, right?

3219
03:15:01,050 --> 03:15:01,530
Here!

3220
03:15:02,970 --> 03:15:03,450
Okay.

3221
03:15:04,470 --> 03:15:04,950
Uh...

3222
03:15:06,230 --> 03:15:08,570
Uh, remember that the water is rising.

3223
03:15:08,950 --> 03:15:09,550
Yes, yes.

3224
03:15:09,870 --> 03:15:11,050
But they can't swim.

3225
03:15:30,440 --> 03:15:31,040
Okay.

3226
03:15:32,440 --> 03:15:33,760
And what can we do?

3227
03:15:35,320 --> 03:15:35,700
Nothing.

3228
03:15:36,360 --> 03:15:38,160
Maybe we have to switch it with a bigger wheel.

3229
03:15:40,660 --> 03:15:43,460
Actually, I don't think that's possible.

3230
03:15:45,060 --> 03:15:45,420
Oh.

3231
03:15:48,860 --> 03:15:50,620
Why do we switch first?

3232
03:15:51,160 --> 03:16:07,600
My brain is already earning these are the same shape what do
you mean they can't what if I swap these does it do anything

3233
03:16:07,600 --> 03:16:17,600
I don't think so I'm just just switching things to switch
them I can't believe it's been almost two months since your

3234
03:16:17,600 --> 03:16:25,960
return my brain rotting mind imagine you coming out of a
foggy haunted forest stands up like hey Hachi when he came

3235
03:16:25,960 --> 03:16:27,860
out of the red smoke in Tekken 7.

3236
03:16:30,200 --> 03:16:31,840
That's pretty epic entrance, I'd say.

3237
03:16:32,160 --> 03:16:32,560
Thank you.

3238
03:16:40,560 --> 03:16:42,280
I need to let time move to see some changes.

3239
03:16:44,500 --> 03:16:44,940
Oh.

3240
03:16:54,660 --> 03:16:56,100
The water's rising.

3241
03:16:58,440 --> 03:17:00,060
Oh my god, that's...

3242
03:17:04,220 --> 03:17:06,880
I have to find a way for Lin to get up to the top.

3243
03:17:07,460 --> 03:17:09,820
A woman who can't swim in an ambitious woman.

3244
03:17:09,840 --> 03:17:11,840
They both head for the top.

3245
03:17:13,280 --> 03:17:13,680
Aether drop.

3246
03:17:13,900 --> 03:17:15,040
Thanks for joining membership.

3247
03:17:16,240 --> 03:17:19,520
To do that, I need to create some kind of footholds for her.

3248
03:17:20,100 --> 03:17:21,760
A woman who can't swim and a sensible woman.

3249
03:17:22,040 --> 03:17:23,660
They both keep their feet on the ground.

3250
03:17:26,200 --> 03:17:26,720
Okay.

3251
03:17:27,360 --> 03:17:30,100
Well, so much for waiting for...

3252
03:17:30,620 --> 03:17:32,140
So much for waiting.

3253
03:17:33,320 --> 03:17:33,840
Okay.

3254
03:17:36,420 --> 03:17:38,200
I'm going ghost.

3255
03:17:39,200 --> 03:17:39,720
What?

3256
03:17:39,840 --> 03:17:40,840
What the...

3257
03:17:44,300 --> 03:17:46,600
I don't even know what to switch at all.

3258
03:18:01,460 --> 03:18:02,480
Don't forget Cicel.

3259
03:18:03,380 --> 03:18:05,620
Yeah, but he can't go anywhere right now.

3260
03:18:07,220 --> 03:18:08,060
Oh wait, yes again!

3261
03:18:08,560 --> 03:18:09,160
What the hell?

3262
03:18:09,900 --> 03:18:10,640
Am I stupid?

3263
03:18:14,280 --> 03:18:15,640
Am I dumb?

3264
03:18:17,020 --> 03:18:17,960
Don't answer that.

3265
03:18:26,380 --> 03:18:29,540
So she was looking at the wheel with the flashlight, wasn't
she?

3266
03:18:30,360 --> 03:18:40,440
I feel like I need to put like Let me talk for hints Go up
is easier said than done when I'm holding Camilla I know

3267
03:18:40,440 --> 03:18:47,380
we're gonna try and create a path for you somehow The water
just keeps on rising Please hurry Oh and by the way did I

3268
03:18:47,380 --> 03:18:57,640
ever tell you You can't swim Neither can Camilla Oops I
already said that didn't I Okay well good luck Okay Oh,

3269
03:19:02,640 --> 03:19:03,720
my brain...

3270
03:19:03,720 --> 03:19:04,520
Wait, operate.

3271
03:19:10,020 --> 03:19:10,340
Okay.

3272
03:19:12,520 --> 03:19:12,860
Oh.

3273
03:19:15,480 --> 03:19:17,780
These pistons sticking out right in front of me.

3274
03:19:17,920 --> 03:19:19,540
It's almost like they're taunting me.

3275
03:19:20,420 --> 03:19:21,400
Maybe it's a challenge.

3276
03:19:22,860 --> 03:19:23,900
It might be just that.

3277
03:19:24,080 --> 03:19:24,960
Think you can climb them?

3278
03:19:25,800 --> 03:19:26,260
Hmm.

3279
03:19:26,680 --> 03:19:28,980
If I wasn't holding Camilla, I could probably do it easily.

3280
03:19:30,360 --> 03:19:30,840
Sizzle!

3281
03:19:31,760 --> 03:19:33,180
You're not telling Miss Linda.

3282
03:19:33,200 --> 03:19:34,740
to leave poor Miss Camilla behind.

3283
03:19:35,120 --> 03:19:35,640
Are you?

3284
03:19:36,940 --> 03:19:38,560
Could you be quiet for a minute?

3285
03:19:39,300 --> 03:19:39,780
Sizzle?

3286
03:19:40,240 --> 03:19:41,100
Shut the hell up.

3287
03:19:42,300 --> 03:19:45,600
These pistons sure do look like they could be used to our
advantage.

3288
03:19:54,520 --> 03:19:55,480
This piston...

3289
03:19:56,580 --> 03:19:58,860
They're silently pressuring me to climb them.

3290
03:19:59,720 --> 03:20:01,060
I doubt they're doing that, Miss Lynn.

3291
03:20:03,160 --> 03:20:03,940
It looks like...

3292
03:20:03,940 --> 03:20:07,900
It looks like how much the pistons thrust out is related to
how large the fan...

3293
03:20:08,740 --> 03:20:09,220
Ah!

3294
03:20:13,930 --> 03:20:15,990
My arms are full, but my legs are free.

3295
03:20:16,970 --> 03:20:20,790
If you could just move these pistons, so they're a little
easier to climb, I think I could do it.

3296
03:20:22,690 --> 03:20:24,430
We need the three different size of fans.

3297
03:20:26,710 --> 03:20:27,070
No, no!

3298
03:20:29,630 --> 03:20:31,490
We had the small one here.

3299
03:20:31,690 --> 03:20:31,830
Oops.

3300
03:20:37,360 --> 03:20:40,960
I think the small one needs to go here.

3301
03:20:41,840 --> 03:20:43,240
But we need the large fan.

3302
03:20:45,720 --> 03:20:46,120
Okay.

3303
03:20:46,140 --> 03:20:49,100
Wait, okay, let's switch the large fan first down here.

3304
03:20:51,120 --> 03:20:52,960
No, no, no.

3305
03:20:53,880 --> 03:20:54,500
Switch.

3306
03:20:58,380 --> 03:20:58,720
Switch.

3307
03:21:00,160 --> 03:21:01,280
Okay, medium fan...

3308
03:21:02,180 --> 03:21:03,500
Medium fan, fine.

3309
03:21:06,300 --> 03:21:07,540
And then here...

3310
03:21:07,540 --> 03:21:08,300
And small fan.

3311
03:21:09,320 --> 03:21:09,860
There we go.

3312
03:21:11,700 --> 03:21:12,000
Okay.

3313
03:21:13,480 --> 03:21:14,100
Uh...

3314
03:21:14,820 --> 03:21:15,960
ZR, ZR, ZR, ZR, ZR, ZR, ZR

3315
03:21:22,070 --> 03:21:23,410
There we go!

3316
03:21:24,350 --> 03:21:25,070
How about that?

3317
03:21:26,030 --> 03:21:26,790
Wow, this is great!

3318
03:21:27,090 --> 03:21:28,330
You made a staircase for me!

3319
03:21:29,190 --> 03:21:29,770
You better hurry!

3320
03:21:29,870 --> 03:21:32,150
I don't think the water is gonna wait for you!

3321
03:21:32,970 --> 03:21:33,530
Okay, yep.

3322
03:21:34,590 --> 03:21:35,330
Let's go!

3323
03:21:36,030 --> 03:21:36,810
Let's go!

3324
03:21:37,730 --> 03:21:38,550
Let's climb!

3325
03:21:39,390 --> 03:21:40,370
Let's go!

3326
03:21:42,270 --> 03:21:42,950
Let's go!

3327
03:21:43,310 --> 03:21:43,990
Nice job, Minto!

3328
03:21:44,390 --> 03:21:44,830
Thank you!

3329
03:21:47,870 --> 03:21:50,690
I think I was trying to see everything all at once.

3330
03:21:51,210 --> 03:21:54,970
But now that I'm seeing that it's done in part, it's not so
bad, you know?

3331
03:21:56,290 --> 03:21:58,330
Okay, here she has to avoid the steam.

3332
03:21:58,490 --> 03:21:59,990
Yeah, I knew that was gonna hurt her.

3333
03:22:02,470 --> 03:22:04,070
Now the steam is getting out.

3334
03:22:04,430 --> 03:22:10,810
Yeah, okay, I think for this one, we have to see, we have to
switch the ones that are pointed down and the ones that are

3335
03:22:10,810 --> 03:22:11,730
pointed up, you know?

3336
03:22:12,410 --> 03:22:13,630
It's too hot to get through.

3337
03:22:15,290 --> 03:22:16,910
And there's no way to get around either.

3338
03:22:17,090 --> 03:22:17,810
Think you can do something?

3339
03:22:18,470 --> 03:22:19,630
Of course we can!

3340
03:22:19,810 --> 03:22:21,810
We have to.

3341
03:22:23,810 --> 03:22:24,770
Trick time.

3342
03:22:28,070 --> 03:22:29,970
Oh, let's get you up there.

3343
03:22:31,610 --> 03:22:31,790
Okay.

3344
03:22:32,790 --> 03:22:34,630
Like, for example, these two can switch.

3345
03:22:35,690 --> 03:22:36,930
Now if they switch, see?

3346
03:22:37,270 --> 03:22:38,330
Oh, but that one's pointed.

3347
03:22:38,830 --> 03:22:41,730
Ah, that one is flowing both ways.

3348
03:22:43,050 --> 03:22:46,410
If I swap the pipes, it changes how the steam comes out.

3349
03:22:47,450 --> 03:22:49,570
Because the cracks in each pipe are different.

3350
03:22:49,810 --> 03:22:53,570
Yes, so each pipe sprays out the scenes in a different way.

3351
03:22:54,270 --> 03:23:07,190
I bet that will come in handy But Two of them Two of them
wait are there any other ones?

3352
03:23:09,270 --> 03:23:14,930
That they can swap with doesn't seem like it wait down No,
that's the balancer

3353
03:23:20,520 --> 03:23:28,620
Hmm Whoa!

3354
03:23:30,760 --> 03:23:33,080
Okay, so they have different degrees too.

3355
03:23:33,200 --> 03:23:33,560
Oh my gosh.

3356
03:23:33,760 --> 03:23:34,400
Wait, hold on!

3357
03:23:34,560 --> 03:23:35,280
I have to see!

3358
03:23:36,580 --> 03:23:37,520
Oh my gosh.

3359
03:23:38,820 --> 03:23:40,200
Here comes the water!

3360
03:23:43,020 --> 03:23:44,980
I wish I could drink it up for you.

3361
03:23:45,280 --> 03:23:46,740
No, Missal, it's too salty!

3362
03:23:47,820 --> 03:23:50,840
I think the more relevant point is that he's dead so we
can't drink it.

3363
03:23:51,840 --> 03:23:53,140
Just do something about the steam.

3364
03:23:53,640 --> 03:23:54,240
Leave it to me!

3365
03:23:54,500 --> 03:23:57,420
Oh, let's try getting Sisal to...

3366
03:23:57,440 --> 03:24:10,160
um maybe the maybe the what's it called oh no wait i'm stuck
wait i'm stuck ah oh if i operate this

3367
03:24:13,300 --> 03:24:20,780
can i get back up there oh my god i'm stuck oh there we go
okay nice nice nice

3368
03:24:23,880 --> 03:24:36,000
okay okay oh my gosh wait i'm still stuck there we go okay i
think we can turn this wheel and that will adjust how some

3369
03:24:36,000 --> 03:24:40,560
of the seam works oh nice nice nice but

3370
03:24:43,850 --> 03:24:52,430
we need okay we need this one to switch with this one
because this one has the most heavy amount of oh wait they

3371
03:24:52,430 --> 03:24:58,850
both have a heavy amount of oh wait wait wait oh i did it
How does that look?

3372
03:24:59,650 --> 03:25:00,190
It looks great.

3373
03:25:00,350 --> 03:25:02,710
All that horrible steam is cleared out of the way.

3374
03:25:05,150 --> 03:25:06,290
It's not far now.

3375
03:25:06,390 --> 03:25:07,630
Let's try and move forward.

3376
03:25:14,520 --> 03:25:15,440
You swapped perfectly.

3377
03:25:15,600 --> 03:25:16,220
First try.

3378
03:25:16,580 --> 03:25:16,960
Yeah.

3379
03:25:18,620 --> 03:25:21,380
I thought I might have to swap one other one, but nice.

3380
03:25:23,420 --> 03:25:25,560
Look up there if I can just make it to that door.

3381
03:25:26,220 --> 03:25:27,000
We can escape.

3382
03:25:29,000 --> 03:25:31,240
Now, how in the world am I going to get up there?

3383
03:25:32,000 --> 03:25:32,940
Don't yell at me.

3384
03:25:34,180 --> 03:25:36,280
If you want to yell, you can yell at me.

3385
03:25:36,460 --> 03:25:38,620
Oh my god, no, nobody shouldn't yell at you, Missal.

3386
03:25:44,120 --> 03:25:45,560
You should play the lottery mint?

3387
03:25:46,480 --> 03:25:47,440
With my luck?

3388
03:25:48,160 --> 03:25:48,880
No way.

3389
03:25:53,600 --> 03:25:56,420
Missal, how can I yell at you when you're so sweet about it?

3390
03:25:57,380 --> 03:25:58,400
Oh, I think you just did.

3391
03:26:00,080 --> 03:26:01,060
Let's look for something...

3392
03:26:01,080 --> 03:26:02,720
To pull Miss Lynn up with.

3393
03:26:03,640 --> 03:26:07,760
Something to whisk Miss Lynn up and glide her ever so gently
to the top with.

3394
03:26:08,840 --> 03:26:10,500
Hey, are you being sarcastic?

3395
03:26:12,300 --> 03:26:12,720
Alright.

3396
03:26:15,660 --> 03:26:16,320
No, no.

3397
03:26:16,900 --> 03:26:18,320
Let's see what we got here.

3398
03:26:19,680 --> 03:26:21,060
A distributing panel.

3399
03:26:22,740 --> 03:26:24,260
A switch, a fuse box.

3400
03:26:27,000 --> 03:26:28,020
A wheel.

3401
03:26:28,360 --> 03:26:31,060
The wheel works for...

3402
03:26:31,080 --> 03:26:36,820
Wait, the switch works for this, uh, for, for this ladder.

3403
03:26:37,180 --> 03:26:42,320
So what does this wheel do?

3404
03:26:44,080 --> 03:26:44,180
Hmm.

3405
03:26:46,920 --> 03:26:49,020
Uh, oh, oh, I'm going ghost.

3406
03:26:50,220 --> 03:26:51,320
Okay, let's see.

3407
03:26:54,420 --> 03:26:55,600
The switch.

3408
03:26:57,720 --> 03:26:59,940
Um, how can I get over there?

3409
03:27:00,180 --> 03:27:00,640
Hmm.

3410
03:27:02,700 --> 03:27:05,480
Because I think the wheel is what does it.

3411
03:27:06,580 --> 03:27:08,060
How can I get over there?

3412
03:27:13,860 --> 03:27:14,380
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

3413
03:27:14,380 --> 03:27:15,660
Emergency light pipe.

3414
03:27:17,180 --> 03:27:17,700
Uh...

3415
03:27:19,220 --> 03:27:22,380
Oh wait, actually, let's get you out of there.

3416
03:27:22,740 --> 03:27:25,400
Let's get to the fuse box and see if there's something we
can do here.

3417
03:27:25,680 --> 03:27:25,860
Oh!

3418
03:27:26,120 --> 03:27:26,200
Oh!

3419
03:27:26,880 --> 03:27:27,340
Open.

3420
03:27:27,960 --> 03:27:28,920
Open, Sesame!

3421
03:27:29,500 --> 03:27:30,520
Okay, ghost.

3422
03:27:31,920 --> 03:27:33,300
Now we can open the door.

3423
03:27:34,720 --> 03:27:36,360
If I can get this door open, Lynn can escape.

3424
03:27:37,300 --> 03:27:38,100
I can't budge it.

3425
03:27:38,220 --> 03:27:39,260
It must be stuck or something.

3426
03:27:40,100 --> 03:27:42,700
I guess we'll have to wait for Lynn to use her miraculous
power.

3427
03:27:44,200 --> 03:27:45,480
Well, first we have to get up there.

3428
03:27:50,160 --> 03:27:52,380
Oh, we can move the hook.

3429
03:27:55,280 --> 03:27:55,600
Easy.

3430
03:27:57,100 --> 03:27:58,520
Never mind, I was overthinking either.

3431
03:27:59,180 --> 03:28:00,680
Now this is what I'm talking about.

3432
03:28:02,500 --> 03:28:03,560
Okay, nice.

3433
03:28:05,020 --> 03:28:05,960
Okay, raise away!

3434
03:28:07,500 --> 03:28:07,760
Whoa!

3435
03:28:10,460 --> 03:28:10,980
Alrighty.

3436
03:28:15,260 --> 03:28:16,260
Okay, come on, Lynn.

3437
03:28:16,760 --> 03:28:17,860
Use your super strength.

3438
03:28:19,560 --> 03:28:21,120
Girl, boss, your way through the door.

3439
03:28:27,320 --> 03:28:28,700
Sorry, I can't do it.

3440
03:28:29,640 --> 03:28:30,440
Open it, hurry!

3441
03:28:31,460 --> 03:28:33,320
Is that any way to ask for something?

3442
03:28:34,220 --> 03:28:35,320
Oh, am I lagging?

3443
03:28:35,440 --> 03:28:35,800
Am I okay?

3444
03:28:36,180 --> 03:28:37,320
Oh, I'm lagging a little bit.

3445
03:28:37,720 --> 03:28:37,720
Sorry.

3446
03:28:38,260 --> 03:28:39,080
Oh, uh...

3447
03:28:39,960 --> 03:28:40,720
What am I doing?

3448
03:28:41,100 --> 03:28:41,400
Opening?

3449
03:28:42,560 --> 03:28:42,920
Together!

3450
03:28:43,980 --> 03:28:44,780
It's no use!

3451
03:28:45,080 --> 03:28:45,720
I can't budget.

3452
03:28:45,840 --> 03:28:46,480
It must be stuck.

3453
03:28:47,680 --> 03:28:48,100
Oh, no!

3454
03:28:51,400 --> 03:28:52,000
Oh, my God.

3455
03:28:52,160 --> 03:28:52,280
Oh, my God.

3456
03:28:52,380 --> 03:28:52,720
Oh, my God.

3457
03:28:52,880 --> 03:28:53,120
No!

3458
03:28:54,780 --> 03:28:56,460
I got so far, please.

3459
03:28:58,480 --> 03:28:59,380
Wait, what just happened?

3460
03:28:59,680 --> 03:28:59,840
Oh!

3461
03:29:02,140 --> 03:29:03,120
What the?

3462
03:29:08,380 --> 03:29:09,420
The Kraken?

3463
03:29:10,920 --> 03:29:12,200
Why am I lagging?

3464
03:29:15,250 --> 03:29:15,770
Who?

3465
03:29:15,770 --> 03:29:16,630
The doctor?

3466
03:29:17,070 --> 03:29:17,670
What just happened?

3467
03:29:18,010 --> 03:29:19,070
I can't believe my eyes.

3468
03:29:19,450 --> 03:29:22,950
Lynn and the little lady suddenly vanish, leaving only
darkness and seawater.

3469
03:29:24,770 --> 03:29:28,350
The submarine continues to sink down, down into the deep,
deep sea.

3470
03:29:28,890 --> 03:29:31,830
But I still want to try and make my way up as far as
possible.

3471
03:29:31,910 --> 03:29:32,570
What just happened?

3472
03:29:35,790 --> 03:29:38,350
Still went to head up to find a single ray of light.

3473
03:29:38,830 --> 03:29:41,750
Light to illuminate the truth at the bottom of this deep,
deep darkness.

3474
03:29:43,190 --> 03:29:43,630
Thanks, Sissel.

3475
03:29:44,050 --> 03:29:44,630
So poetic.

3476
03:29:46,530 --> 03:29:47,210
What just... Who?

3477
03:29:47,910 --> 03:29:48,090
Huh?

3478
03:29:53,140 --> 03:29:54,660
The final struggle.

3479
03:29:58,250 --> 03:29:58,770
Okay.

3480
03:29:59,670 --> 03:30:00,810
What chapter are we on now?

3481
03:30:01,130 --> 03:30:01,610
17?

3482
03:30:05,570 --> 03:30:06,090
17.

3483
03:30:06,410 --> 03:30:07,510
Two more chapters!

3484
03:30:08,250 --> 03:30:09,270
Oh my gosh.

3485
03:30:10,750 --> 03:30:11,270
Okay.

3486
03:30:12,610 --> 03:30:15,610
The upended submarine continues to sink slowly but surely.

3487
03:30:16,230 --> 03:30:18,550
A long, long journey to the bottom of the sea.

3488
03:30:23,740 --> 03:30:27,460
Lynn and the little lady found the darkness and the salt
water closing in on them.

3489
03:30:28,020 --> 03:30:30,340
But at the very last second, something saved them.

3490
03:30:30,700 --> 03:30:32,600
Now it looks down at them quietly.

3491
03:30:33,400 --> 03:30:34,460
Is it Ray?

3492
03:30:35,620 --> 03:30:36,540
The claw.

3493
03:30:39,380 --> 03:30:41,660
Oh my god, it looks like it has big old googly eyes.

3494
03:30:42,640 --> 03:30:44,660
My head is filled with one giant question.

3495
03:30:45,880 --> 03:30:47,030
What in the world is this thing?

3496
03:30:49,380 --> 03:30:49,960
Um.

3497
03:30:50,920 --> 03:30:51,620
What?

3498
03:30:52,380 --> 03:30:52,760
Eee!

3499
03:30:56,450 --> 03:30:57,150
Oh.

3500
03:30:57,590 --> 03:30:57,670
Oh.

3501
03:30:58,110 --> 03:30:58,250
Oh.

3502
03:30:59,090 --> 03:31:00,350
That only had enough.

3503
03:31:00,690 --> 03:31:01,010
What the?

3504
03:31:01,950 --> 03:31:02,370
What?

3505
03:31:03,670 --> 03:31:04,640
Oh my god, it's...

3506
03:31:05,590 --> 03:31:06,290
What?

3507
03:31:07,350 --> 03:31:09,490
It's Dark Magician...

3508
03:31:10,310 --> 03:31:11,530
Wait, it's Sisa?

3509
03:31:18,770 --> 03:31:21,930
I see you managed to survive, detective.

3510
03:31:25,410 --> 03:31:26,610
Hey, you're...

3511
03:31:26,610 --> 03:31:28,150
Excuse my appearance.

3512
03:31:28,330 --> 03:31:29,950
I seem to have lost my body.

3513
03:31:32,210 --> 03:31:33,430
He looks so awesome.

3514
03:31:34,290 --> 03:31:34,870
Oh, no.

3515
03:31:35,930 --> 03:31:37,070
I'm into robots.

3516
03:31:38,170 --> 03:31:38,930
Oh, and you...

3517
03:31:38,930 --> 03:31:39,590
Me?

3518
03:31:40,690 --> 03:31:41,010
Me?

3519
03:31:41,050 --> 03:31:41,130
Minto?

3520
03:31:41,770 --> 03:31:44,730
You're the ghost who's been saving Lin all evening, aren't
you?

3521
03:31:45,110 --> 03:32:00,660
I mean yeah I guess you might say that I am the ghost that's
been doing all the work huh yeah you

3522
03:32:06,730 --> 03:32:15,110
knew about me all along of course what else would explain
all those unnatural things happening if you knew how come

3523
03:32:15,110 --> 03:32:21,710
you didn't do anything about it all this time and how come
you decided to save us all of a sudden I I thought you

3524
03:32:21,710 --> 03:32:23,090
wanted to get revenge on us.

3525
03:32:24,750 --> 03:32:25,950
Fourth wall break real.

3526
03:32:28,310 --> 03:32:29,050
I don't really know.

3527
03:32:30,950 --> 03:32:32,190
Please, you gotta tell me.

3528
03:32:32,710 --> 03:32:33,710
I need to know.

3529
03:32:37,290 --> 03:32:38,930
I'm back into a wisp.

3530
03:32:40,330 --> 03:32:41,670
Who in the world are you?

3531
03:32:42,930 --> 03:32:43,930
Cecil, look at you!

3532
03:32:44,290 --> 03:32:44,910
What happened?

3533
03:32:45,670 --> 03:32:48,290
I can't hold on to that image of myself any longer.

3534
03:32:50,590 --> 03:32:51,270
who you are?

3535
03:32:52,670 --> 03:32:53,110
That's right.

3536
03:32:53,450 --> 03:32:54,390
I'm a cool wisp.

3537
03:32:56,030 --> 03:32:56,650
It's you guys.

3538
03:32:57,570 --> 03:33:00,370
I came all this way tonight trying to chase down my lost
memory.

3539
03:33:01,110 --> 03:33:03,410
For quite a bit of tonight, I thought I was you, Sissel.

3540
03:33:04,570 --> 03:33:05,050
Sissel?

3541
03:33:05,570 --> 03:33:06,590
My name isn't Sissel.

3542
03:33:08,830 --> 03:33:09,830
Wait, but we knew that.

3543
03:33:10,470 --> 03:33:12,010
I bet you'll remember really soon.

3544
03:33:12,630 --> 03:33:14,950
Who you are and who I am too.

3545
03:33:16,830 --> 03:33:17,170
What?

3546
03:33:18,290 --> 03:33:18,770
What?

3547
03:33:20,990 --> 03:33:28,650
the man in front of me is not me I'm even further away from
the truth or maybe not something is stirring in my mind a

3548
03:33:28,650 --> 03:33:38,370
memory about to emerge do I know this man now that I've shed
my image of myself I feel like I'm one step closer to the

3549
03:33:38,370 --> 03:33:42,630
truth info dump incoming let's go

3550
03:33:46,400 --> 03:33:56,100
but the water they got us good it's all over for this
submarine.

3551
03:33:57,160 --> 03:33:58,520
Its engine room is destroyed.

3552
03:33:59,020 --> 03:33:59,960
There's a hole in the hole.

3553
03:34:02,200 --> 03:34:05,420
Wait, there's a hole in the hole.

3554
03:34:06,940 --> 03:34:10,060
There's a hole in the hole.

3555
03:34:11,720 --> 03:34:13,220
In the hole.

3556
03:34:14,220 --> 03:34:18,140
And it's sinking as we speak.

3557
03:34:20,640 --> 03:34:21,620
What are you doing here?

3558
03:34:22,360 --> 03:34:24,020
I thought you had to deal with those people.

3559
03:34:25,660 --> 03:34:26,920
They betrayed me.

3560
03:34:27,300 --> 03:34:28,600
I was a fool to trust them.

3561
03:34:29,600 --> 03:34:31,200
They already have what they wanted now.

3562
03:34:32,120 --> 03:34:32,960
But how do we still have the...

3563
03:34:32,960 --> 03:34:34,100
How does they still have the powers?

3564
03:34:34,700 --> 03:34:35,820
The Temsic fragment.

3565
03:34:37,700 --> 03:34:39,640
I didn't know they had it all figured out.

3566
03:34:41,220 --> 03:34:43,160
You mean they figured out the source of your powers?

3567
03:34:44,180 --> 03:34:47,360
A hole in the hull.

3568
03:34:52,340 --> 03:34:55,180
A hole in the hole in the hole in the hole in the hole in
the hole.

3569
03:34:59,450 --> 03:35:03,330
Yeah, that meteorite's radiation has two effects on living
creatures.

3570
03:35:04,270 --> 03:35:06,030
It gives power and time.

3571
03:35:08,870 --> 03:35:11,650
If you don't mind, we'd like to hear more.

3572
03:35:13,210 --> 03:35:15,290
Oh, the radiation's power effect.

3573
03:35:16,570 --> 03:35:17,490
These 10 years.

3574
03:35:18,090 --> 03:35:21,130
I've been watching that junkyard superintendent do his
research.

3575
03:35:25,130 --> 03:35:26,190
Hold me.

3576
03:35:27,210 --> 03:35:28,570
Yo, Mint, I heard you like drowning.

3577
03:35:28,590 --> 03:35:43,510
so I put a hole in the hole so you can sink while you sink
and I think I've kind of got some of it figured out the

3578
03:35:45,360 --> 03:35:54,080
meteorites radiation gives spirits special powers like
possessing and manipulating objects and in my case swapping

3579
03:35:54,080 --> 03:36:02,100
objects exactly apparently there are individual differences
in the powers we get and it seems these powers change as

3580
03:36:02,100 --> 03:36:11,840
time goes by they do yeah my powers have changed over these
past 10 years at first I could only manipulate small living

3581
03:36:11,840 --> 03:36:25,180
creatures now then how do you suppose we got these powers
it's simple it is how then in a nutshell we died while

3582
03:36:25,180 --> 03:36:27,980
exposed to the energy admitted by the meteorite.

3583
03:36:28,280 --> 03:36:29,360
It's radiation.

3584
03:36:29,880 --> 03:36:30,400
Mm-hmm.

3585
03:36:30,980 --> 03:36:32,000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

3586
03:36:33,020 --> 03:36:34,100
That's what does it?

3587
03:36:34,280 --> 03:36:36,260
Dying while being exposed to the radiation?

3588
03:36:38,440 --> 03:36:40,180
On that day, 10 years ago.

3589
03:36:41,140 --> 03:36:43,400
Oh my gosh, we actually see his outline, his silhouette.

3590
03:36:46,500 --> 03:36:46,940
Whoa!

3591
03:36:47,140 --> 03:36:47,580
Whoa!

3592
03:36:48,200 --> 03:36:48,680
Oh my god.

3593
03:36:49,020 --> 03:36:51,340
Butt up in the air, just like how he died again!

3594
03:36:54,940 --> 03:36:58,160
of that meteorite pierced my heart and I died.

3595
03:37:01,440 --> 03:37:03,460
So of course I received special powers.

3596
03:37:05,160 --> 03:37:06,340
It's a canon event.

3597
03:37:06,940 --> 03:37:07,640
Hey, wait a minute.

3598
03:37:08,440 --> 03:37:09,820
Is that how I got my powers, too?

3599
03:37:11,140 --> 03:37:12,500
You know that might be right.

3600
03:37:13,660 --> 03:37:14,920
No, I don't want to see it.

3601
03:37:16,840 --> 03:37:17,100
No!

3602
03:37:25,110 --> 03:37:28,810
Aren't the Temzik remnants still right there in that park at
the bottom of the crater?

3603
03:37:29,970 --> 03:37:30,510
You're right.

3604
03:37:30,530 --> 03:37:30,790
right.

3605
03:37:32,190 --> 03:37:36,570
So that must mean, I must have died in the presence of the
meteorite's radiation too.

3606
03:37:41,460 --> 03:37:42,940
The radiation's time effect.

3607
03:37:44,360 --> 03:37:47,840
Another effect the meteorite's radiation has on us is that
it gives us time.

3608
03:37:48,600 --> 03:37:53,200
Again, I think this time effect is centered around the theme
of death, but it's not all that clear.

3609
03:37:54,260 --> 03:37:59,320
So the fact that I can return to four minutes before a
person's death is another effect of that meteorite.

3610
03:38:02,860 --> 03:38:12,360
characteristics of that meteorite is that is its ability to
replay the moment of death replay the moment of death this

3611
03:38:12,360 --> 03:38:21,740
is all so strange and confusing i can't take it all in it
makes about as much sense to me as anything else yeah

3612
03:38:21,740 --> 03:38:32,140
strange and confusing that just about sums up the object
that pierced my body that day four minutes death hype yeah

3613
03:38:32,860 --> 03:38:37,640
Thanks to that meteorite fragment, my very existence is a
contradiction.

3614
03:38:39,020 --> 03:38:39,520
What do you mean?

3615
03:38:42,040 --> 03:38:43,380
Contradictory existence?

3616
03:38:44,740 --> 03:38:48,360
That day, when the fragment pierced my heart, I lost my
life.

3617
03:38:48,940 --> 03:38:55,140
However, because it remained inside me, that fragment
continued to constantly regenerate my body.

3618
03:38:56,360 --> 03:39:02,700
In other words, my body was continuously cycling between the
moments that separated my life and death.

3619
03:39:05,400 --> 03:39:13,820
my body is vital function stopped 10 years ago but my body's
time is perpetually stopped at the moment just before death

3620
03:39:13,820 --> 03:39:22,760
so that's why he doesn't um that's why he hasn't uh what's
the word oh my god

3621
03:39:27,060 --> 03:39:38,880
dissolved that's why he hasn't dissolved his body decomposed
decomposed yeah yeah I've been trying to think of decapote

3622
03:39:38,880 --> 03:39:42,500
that word all night and every time I just keep thinking of

3623
03:39:48,030 --> 03:39:57,830
dissolved time just stopped huh so I just simply existed not
really alive not really dead that pretty much sums up these

3624
03:39:57,830 --> 03:40:08,150
last 10 years for me ever since that incident in the park my
body hasn't aged a day my hair hasn't grown an inch that old

3625
03:40:08,150 --> 03:40:09,550
pigeon guy mentioned something.

3626
03:40:10,090 --> 03:40:11,690
He said he couldn't cut his...

3627
03:40:11,690 --> 03:40:13,170
this guy's body with the scapple.

3628
03:40:13,370 --> 03:40:13,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3629
03:40:15,390 --> 03:40:18,490
Neither truly alive nor truly dead.

3630
03:40:20,170 --> 03:40:23,670
This game is becoming more and more like Metal Gear.

3631
03:40:25,610 --> 03:40:28,690
Anata no story now, Aata wa cool.

3632
03:40:30,610 --> 03:40:32,390
Thank you for the silver child.

3633
03:40:33,670 --> 03:40:37,030
So I guess as soon as an incision was made, his body would
be regenerated.

3634
03:40:37,610 --> 03:40:38,030
Wow.

3635
03:40:40,390 --> 03:40:43,070
This guy is just gray fox wanting to get revenge.

3636
03:40:43,970 --> 03:40:47,690
And also, not being able to be alive or dead.

3637
03:40:48,730 --> 03:40:49,650
After Tempsick.

3638
03:40:51,070 --> 03:40:51,530
Revenge.

3639
03:40:52,490 --> 03:40:55,230
Before I left this country, I wanted to do one thing.

3640
03:40:55,810 --> 03:40:58,770
I wanted to get revenge on the people who stole our lives.

3641
03:40:59,670 --> 03:41:00,470
Our lives.

3642
03:41:01,450 --> 03:41:04,230
As part of the deal, I made those guys promise to cooperate.

3643
03:41:06,050 --> 03:41:06,510
Cooperate?

3644
03:41:06,590 --> 03:41:07,350
You mean the kidnapping?

3645
03:41:07,610 --> 03:41:17,170
it all went fine I manipulated the justice minister and made
him issue the execution order but I thought he might call

3646
03:41:17,170 --> 03:41:25,690
off the execution at the last second so that's why you
wanted his daughter kidnapped but they kidnapped the wrong

3647
03:41:25,690 --> 03:41:38,270
girl who is our yeah unless unless also the wife no hmm
little did I know.

3648
03:41:38,750 --> 03:41:40,970
They had their own reasons for cooperating with me.

3649
03:41:41,210 --> 03:41:44,490
I mean, yeah, what would they get out of it if not having
their own reasons?

3650
03:41:52,150 --> 03:41:55,270
Their objective was to wipe out everybody who had to do with
Temsik.

3651
03:42:01,760 --> 03:42:06,360
Detective Jowd was one such person, so they were happy to
cooperate.

3652
03:42:10,620 --> 03:42:13,680
The professor and Detective Cabanella.

3653
03:42:13,900 --> 03:42:16,680
Inspector Cabanella and that junkyard super.

3654
03:42:16,900 --> 03:42:19,060
They were slated to be wiped out too.

3655
03:42:22,780 --> 03:42:24,360
And as it turns out...

3656
03:42:33,990 --> 03:42:34,570
Whoa!

3657
03:42:36,510 --> 03:42:38,430
I was one of their targets as well.

3658
03:42:40,290 --> 03:42:42,330
So they stole my Temsic fragment.

3659
03:42:42,690 --> 03:42:43,490
And here I am.

3660
03:42:46,410 --> 03:42:47,190
So cool.

3661
03:42:47,330 --> 03:42:48,010
I know, right?

3662
03:42:49,050 --> 03:42:51,670
But they had one more final target.

3663
03:42:54,150 --> 03:42:54,630
Lynn?

3664
03:42:55,330 --> 03:42:56,130
You, detective.

3665
03:42:56,930 --> 03:42:57,090
Hmm.

3666
03:42:58,510 --> 03:42:58,870
Me?

3667
03:43:03,630 --> 03:43:04,990
One final target.

3668
03:43:05,510 --> 03:43:06,470
Yeah, because you were there.

3669
03:43:07,070 --> 03:43:14,410
If you weren't there in the park that day, 10 years ago, I
never would have thought of doing something as stupid as

3670
03:43:14,410 --> 03:43:15,310
taking a hostage.

3671
03:43:16,510 --> 03:43:16,990
Okay.

3672
03:43:18,330 --> 03:43:19,670
Totally her fault, yep.

3673
03:43:20,070 --> 03:43:22,370
With her golden plunger, whatever the hell she's holding.

3674
03:43:23,950 --> 03:43:38,530
kid playing in the park yeah I know hmm 10 years later I
need to become a detective looking into Jowd's case it's

3675
03:43:38,530 --> 03:43:46,690
your fault I took you hostage I know right tonight I invited
you to a quiet spot on the edge of town there was a trap you

3676
03:43:46,690 --> 03:43:49,910
see so

3677
03:43:55,020 --> 03:44:07,080
I told you who I was so that's why then he her to shoot him
and then then they were going to assassinate her but wait

3678
03:44:07,080 --> 03:44:18,300
they didn't need to huh she was gonna get taken to jail
anyway you never saw my face that day ten years ago so of

3679
03:44:18,300 --> 03:44:35,740
course you didn't recognize me wait me no no he's like yep
what can I say he's so cool yeah see then I took possession

3680
03:44:35,740 --> 03:44:52,260
of you and to make you shoot me yeah yeah yeah get the gun
whoa he's so kakui your subconscious resisted me such

3681
03:44:52,260 --> 03:45:02,490
incredible power it was the first time I wasn't able to
control somebody completely the aim was all and the first

3682
03:45:02,490 --> 03:45:03,750
shot missed the mark.

3683
03:45:05,550 --> 03:45:05,690
Oh!

3684
03:45:14,440 --> 03:45:17,540
The junkyard was equipped with security cameras.

3685
03:45:17,740 --> 03:45:18,200
Wait a second.

3686
03:45:21,260 --> 03:45:22,640
The first shot that missed.

3687
03:45:25,540 --> 03:45:27,120
The first shot that missed.

3688
03:45:27,760 --> 03:45:28,980
That's what killed me!

3689
03:45:29,660 --> 03:45:31,080
That's what killed original Cicel!

3690
03:45:31,400 --> 03:45:33,300
Wait, but...

3691
03:45:33,300 --> 03:45:33,920
Where...

3692
03:45:36,060 --> 03:45:36,760
Oh.

3693
03:45:36,860 --> 03:45:38,580
What did it hit?

3694
03:45:39,160 --> 03:45:40,360
Where did it go?

3695
03:45:40,780 --> 03:45:41,580
What did it hit?

3696
03:45:42,260 --> 03:45:43,180
But it was down!

3697
03:45:45,620 --> 03:45:47,680
The junkyard was equipped with security cameras.

3698
03:45:48,600 --> 03:45:50,040
I knew you'd be wanted for murder.

3699
03:45:52,220 --> 03:45:53,680
That was my plan anyway.

3700
03:45:59,670 --> 03:46:00,510
Uh-oh.

3701
03:46:02,330 --> 03:46:03,490
Uh-oh.

3702
03:46:03,490 --> 03:46:04,990
What if you're a raccoon?

3703
03:46:05,850 --> 03:46:07,970
And then it's, um...

3704
03:46:09,270 --> 03:46:11,150
But they had other ideas.

3705
03:46:11,470 --> 03:46:13,230
They simply wanted to be wiped out.

3706
03:46:13,590 --> 03:46:14,410
Ah, okay, okay.

3707
03:46:14,830 --> 03:46:18,050
But then, something threw a big monkey wrench into their
scheme.

3708
03:46:20,450 --> 03:46:27,330
Because if we're close to the body, if we died close to the
body, then of course we would get the powers.

3709
03:46:28,670 --> 03:46:30,170
I show- Are we a rat?

3710
03:46:32,090 --> 03:46:33,810
Oh my gosh, are we a rat?

3711
03:46:34,670 --> 03:46:36,590
We've been a rat this whole time?

3712
03:46:36,710 --> 03:46:37,570
Are we a rat?

3713
03:46:38,230 --> 03:46:39,370
No way.

3714
03:46:39,930 --> 03:46:42,130
That's why we've been following the rats.

3715
03:46:42,810 --> 03:46:44,230
Oh my gosh, we're a rat.

3716
03:46:45,770 --> 03:46:48,350
Remember how I said it's like we're not human.

3717
03:46:48,810 --> 03:46:50,050
Oh my gosh, we're a rat.

3718
03:46:50,970 --> 03:46:52,210
I showed up.

3719
03:46:52,970 --> 03:46:54,210
You shot a rat.

3720
03:46:54,730 --> 03:46:55,910
You shot a rat.

3721
03:46:56,870 --> 03:46:59,650
I was supposed to meet up with them after that.

3722
03:47:00,370 --> 03:47:01,890
But then something went wrong.

3723
03:47:03,110 --> 03:47:03,770
What happened?

3724
03:47:04,570 --> 03:47:05,790
My body disappeared.

3725
03:47:07,090 --> 03:47:07,330
Aha.

3726
03:47:08,230 --> 03:47:09,790
in white was responsible for that one.

3727
03:47:13,110 --> 03:47:13,850
Stop reading, chat.

3728
03:47:14,390 --> 03:47:15,110
I'm not!

3729
03:47:18,690 --> 03:47:19,410
I'm not.

3730
03:47:20,030 --> 03:47:22,670
When I'm cooking, I'm really, I'm really just thinking.

3731
03:47:27,520 --> 03:47:28,680
But also, don't spoil stuff.

3732
03:47:29,280 --> 03:47:29,820
Do not read, chat?

3733
03:47:29,920 --> 03:47:30,560
Okay, I won't read chat.

3734
03:47:31,340 --> 03:47:32,020
Stop reading, chat.

3735
03:47:32,100 --> 03:47:33,640
If you guys are posting spoilers, stop it.

3736
03:47:34,300 --> 03:47:36,220
My precious bargaining chip was in that body.

3737
03:47:36,920 --> 03:47:38,500
I had to get it back no matter what.

3738
03:47:40,460 --> 03:47:43,220
Spectre caused me no end of trouble.

3739
03:47:45,040 --> 03:47:46,960
But why were those people targeting me?

3740
03:47:47,640 --> 03:47:49,720
I never even heard of the Tempsic meteorite.

3741
03:47:51,020 --> 03:47:52,700
Because you were looking into the Jowd case.

3742
03:47:53,660 --> 03:47:57,260
They thought you would find out about Tempsic sooner or
later.

3743
03:48:00,060 --> 03:48:00,620
Okay.

3744
03:48:01,940 --> 03:48:03,460
I guess that's true.

3745
03:48:05,240 --> 03:48:05,560
Uh-oh.

3746
03:48:05,900 --> 03:48:07,000
How do we get out of here?

3747
03:48:09,140 --> 03:48:10,440
This is so titanic.

3748
03:48:10,460 --> 03:48:11,280
It's scary.

3749
03:48:12,340 --> 03:48:13,960
That's pretty much the whole story.

3750
03:48:14,800 --> 03:48:18,140
The only thing left to do now is wait for water pressure to
crush the submarine.

3751
03:48:19,120 --> 03:48:19,700
Oh, no!

3752
03:48:20,500 --> 03:48:23,500
There's no cores that link from here to the water surface.

3753
03:48:25,080 --> 03:48:26,540
Welcome back, after midnight.

3754
03:48:26,640 --> 03:48:27,060
Thank you.

3755
03:48:27,660 --> 03:48:28,300
I have an idea.

3756
03:48:28,680 --> 03:48:30,540
We hook up the phone line and...

3757
03:48:30,540 --> 03:48:33,220
There are no communication cables down this deep.

3758
03:48:34,720 --> 03:48:36,820
They meant for this submarine to be my coffin.

3759
03:48:37,280 --> 03:48:38,480
A coffin for the dead.

3760
03:48:39,420 --> 03:48:40,440
There's no escape

3761
03:48:45,030 --> 03:48:52,830
I think I kind of understand now What you've been feeling
these 10 years You what?

3762
03:48:54,110 --> 03:49:02,230
This feeling Cut off from the world all alone in a submarine
Sinking slowly towards the bottom of an endless sea This

3763
03:49:02,230 --> 03:49:03,870
must be how you felt all along

3764
03:49:08,760 --> 03:49:11,920
Oh, Camilla's awake

3765
03:49:16,240 --> 03:49:21,650
Lynn Is it true?

3766
03:49:22,070 --> 03:49:23,130
We're stuck here?

3767
03:49:23,910 --> 03:49:24,070
What?

3768
03:49:24,810 --> 03:49:30,730
Oh, oh, oh, at least she's comfy, right?

3769
03:49:31,350 --> 03:49:37,910
If my dad, if my dad was here, I bet he'd save us.

3770
03:49:40,450 --> 03:49:44,430
No, this can't be the end.

3771
03:49:44,890 --> 03:49:46,450
Oh, Camilla, I'm so sorry.

3772
03:49:50,270 --> 03:49:58,310
funny what is it sisal there's something i don't understand
why would they go to all the trouble of detaching the

3773
03:49:58,310 --> 03:50:06,370
control room what why didn't they just steal the tempsic
fragment and escape if that's what they wanted why did they

3774
03:50:06,370 --> 03:50:14,310
have to jettison your body off into the sea that's a good
question well because he could still get around right he

3775
03:50:14,310 --> 03:50:24,750
could still uh but I guess it doesn't matter why now we'll
never find it again we have no idea where it was launched to

3776
03:50:26,750 --> 03:50:40,410
wait a minute yes we do oh my gosh he has the pocket watch
this will tell us where Detective Jowd is that present from

3777
03:50:40,410 --> 03:50:47,190
the inspector in white that's right Detective Jowd told me
to hold on to it for him And the bullet is still in this

3778
03:50:47,190 --> 03:50:49,210
person's body in the command room, right?

3779
03:50:50,570 --> 03:50:51,370
Oh, nice!

3780
03:50:52,310 --> 03:50:54,970
Then we should be able to tell exactly where it is with
this.

3781
03:50:56,710 --> 03:50:59,430
But even if we find out where it is, how do we get there?

3782
03:51:00,910 --> 03:51:04,650
We should be able to figure out something between the three
of us.

3783
03:51:05,190 --> 03:51:06,010
With our powers.

3784
03:51:06,490 --> 03:51:07,290
Right, Miss Lynn!

3785
03:51:09,030 --> 03:51:09,430
Right.

3786
03:51:09,950 --> 03:51:13,790
Wait, are we going to get the manipulating powers?

3787
03:51:16,150 --> 03:51:18,030
Wait a minute, what about a torpedo?

3788
03:51:19,290 --> 03:51:19,790
A torpedo?

3789
03:51:20,910 --> 03:51:23,470
In any case, it's way too early to give up.

3790
03:51:24,510 --> 03:51:26,130
Looks like Detective Jowd is our last hope.

3791
03:51:27,190 --> 03:51:27,930
Let's get started.

3792
03:51:29,670 --> 03:51:30,210
Oh my gosh.

3793
03:51:33,010 --> 03:51:33,510
Let's...

3794
03:51:34,170 --> 03:51:35,430
We got the bottle.

3795
03:51:36,310 --> 03:51:37,670
We got...

3796
03:51:37,670 --> 03:51:39,030
The control panel.

3797
03:51:39,190 --> 03:51:40,070
Let's operate this.

3798
03:51:40,210 --> 03:51:40,830
Beep-bop-bop-bip.

3799
03:51:41,350 --> 03:51:41,550
Oh!

3800
03:51:42,050 --> 03:51:43,310
Some grapes?

3801
03:51:43,670 --> 03:51:43,770
No.

3802
03:51:43,790 --> 03:51:44,350
Nice.

3803
03:51:45,250 --> 03:51:46,470
We won't starve.

3804
03:51:49,930 --> 03:51:50,730
Telephone dial.

3805
03:51:53,050 --> 03:51:53,990
Torpedo room.

3806
03:51:55,490 --> 03:51:56,710
The torpedo room, huh?

3807
03:51:57,530 --> 03:51:58,990
There might be another torpedo left there.

3808
03:51:59,130 --> 03:51:59,610
I'll go check it out.

3809
03:51:59,710 --> 03:52:00,490
Yeah, there was one.

3810
03:52:01,350 --> 03:52:04,230
Going to use a missile to ram the control room.

3811
03:52:04,990 --> 03:52:06,270
Well, I don't know about ram.

3812
03:52:07,150 --> 03:52:09,150
We don't want to blow Detective Jowd up.

3813
03:52:09,330 --> 03:52:10,270
But something like that.

3814
03:52:12,070 --> 03:52:13,690
We'll climb up to the torpedo room too.

3815
03:52:13,790 --> 03:52:15,130
Up is definitely safer.

3816
03:52:16,010 --> 03:52:16,990
I'll see you there, then.

3817
03:52:20,310 --> 03:52:23,050
I like how we still have the glasses on.

3818
03:52:24,710 --> 03:52:27,850
Looks like the torpedoes can be launched manually with these
switches.

3819
03:52:30,710 --> 03:52:33,290
There are two tubes, so there should be one left.

3820
03:52:34,030 --> 03:52:36,950
I guess the first thing we have to do is load it into the
tube.

3821
03:52:38,030 --> 03:52:40,870
When it comes to missiles, you can count on me.

3822
03:52:41,910 --> 03:52:42,350
Okay.

3823
03:52:42,970 --> 03:52:43,770
I'll enter the...

3824
03:52:43,790 --> 03:52:49,950
coordinates of the of the command room into the torpedo and

3825
03:52:54,680 --> 03:53:05,020
I just turned on the backup power we ought to be able to use
the switches now okay let's try it good luck so what do I do

3826
03:53:05,020 --> 03:53:17,500
lower the switch or yeah lower the switch won't budge maybe
it's broken I don't think the entire device is broken would

3827
03:53:17,500 --> 03:53:19,820
probably work Find if I can move this switch.

3828
03:53:20,000 --> 03:53:21,500
We'll just have to find a way to move it somehow.

3829
03:53:22,340 --> 03:53:23,540
But I can't do it with my powers alone.

3830
03:53:23,680 --> 03:53:25,180
Do you like my sunglasses?

3831
03:53:25,660 --> 03:53:26,680
Thanks for the super chat.

3832
03:53:29,360 --> 03:53:31,140
It's because he's not a ghost.

3833
03:53:31,360 --> 03:53:32,260
He's a shade.

3834
03:53:34,280 --> 03:53:35,400
Ah, ha, ha, ha.

3835
03:53:36,000 --> 03:53:36,800
So true.

3836
03:53:37,300 --> 03:53:38,720
What kind of ghost do you think I am?

3837
03:53:44,800 --> 03:53:46,080
Let's turn this valve.

3838
03:53:47,300 --> 03:53:48,200
See what this does.

3839
03:53:49,460 --> 03:53:49,860
Nothing.

3840
03:53:51,580 --> 03:53:52,440
Do I go to the end?

3841
03:53:52,460 --> 03:53:52,980
engine room?

3842
03:53:58,400 --> 03:53:59,320
A phantom?

3843
03:54:00,280 --> 03:54:00,920
Good guess.

3844
03:54:02,460 --> 03:54:03,220
Good guess.

3845
03:54:05,520 --> 03:54:05,640
Hmm.

3846
03:54:06,100 --> 03:54:08,600
The phone line to the engine room isn't working right now.

3847
03:54:09,060 --> 03:54:10,540
Well, that water probably damaged the line.

3848
03:54:10,960 --> 03:54:12,240
I guess we don't need to go back there anyway.

3849
03:54:12,900 --> 03:54:12,900
Okay.

3850
03:54:14,820 --> 03:54:15,740
Uh, wait.

3851
03:54:16,920 --> 03:54:18,880
Can I get you to move there, Missile?

3852
03:54:22,470 --> 03:54:24,550
What will happen to these two ladies?

3853
03:54:25,270 --> 03:54:27,230
I think that's up to us and our powers.

3854
03:54:27,690 --> 03:54:28,210
What?

3855
03:54:28,990 --> 03:54:31,150
This is no time to be standing around unsure of ourselves.

3856
03:54:31,610 --> 03:54:32,710
Will you lend me your strength missile?

3857
03:54:33,450 --> 03:54:33,650
Me?

3858
03:54:34,070 --> 03:54:34,770
Of course I will.

3859
03:54:35,590 --> 03:54:36,450
Count on it!

3860
03:54:36,930 --> 03:54:37,750
Okay, there we go.

3861
03:54:41,870 --> 03:54:43,850
I'm not quite sure what I...

3862
03:54:46,920 --> 03:54:49,360
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

3863
03:54:50,400 --> 03:54:51,300
Waste basket?

3864
03:54:51,980 --> 03:54:52,540
Basketball.

3865
03:54:58,180 --> 03:54:59,360
There's still stuff here.

3866
03:55:00,040 --> 03:55:00,560
Telephone.

3867
03:55:01,100 --> 03:55:01,960
Emergency light.

3868
03:55:06,720 --> 03:55:08,340
Can't reach over there.

3869
03:55:09,320 --> 03:55:10,580
Maybe if we go here.

3870
03:55:11,780 --> 03:55:12,060
Here.

3871
03:55:12,480 --> 03:55:12,560
Oh.

3872
03:55:13,520 --> 03:55:13,980
Here.

3873
03:55:14,660 --> 03:55:18,860
Still no, but let's try lowering anyway.

3874
03:55:21,980 --> 03:55:23,000
Okay, it didn't do anything.

3875
03:55:27,300 --> 03:55:31,280
Where is the torpedo that we're supposed to be...

3876
03:55:32,720 --> 03:55:34,500
That we're supposed to be...

3877
03:55:35,720 --> 03:55:50,530
putting in there right or something cleared the same same
challenge I unlocked the song same save Wow I had no idea

3878
03:55:50,530 --> 03:56:05,390
your deaths a silky ghost made of a house hmm was I a made
of a house though I wonder hmm it

3879
03:56:08,970 --> 03:56:14,330
allows me to go down here But I'm not quite sure what I'm
supposed to be doing here.

3880
03:56:16,550 --> 03:56:16,950
Telephone.

3881
03:56:19,630 --> 03:56:20,450
Oh, wait a second.

3882
03:56:20,850 --> 03:56:21,750
Oh, I'm silly.

3883
03:56:21,970 --> 03:56:22,690
I'm so silly.

3884
03:56:23,010 --> 03:56:24,550
Okay, I get what I'm supposed to be doing here now.

3885
03:56:24,870 --> 03:56:26,070
Okay, we gotta...

3886
03:56:26,070 --> 03:56:27,330
We're switching the handles.

3887
03:56:28,050 --> 03:56:28,550
I get it.

3888
03:56:28,570 --> 03:56:29,210
I get it now.

3889
03:56:30,870 --> 03:56:31,630
I'm silly.

3890
03:56:32,770 --> 03:56:33,250
Oh, wait.

3891
03:56:33,390 --> 03:56:35,690
How do I get over into the handle though?

3892
03:56:37,210 --> 03:56:37,890
There we go.

3893
03:56:38,470 --> 03:56:38,870
Switch!

3894
03:56:40,370 --> 03:56:41,790
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3895
03:56:43,110 --> 03:56:44,310
And then...

3896
03:56:44,310 --> 03:56:45,430
Go back down.

3897
03:56:47,090 --> 03:56:48,470
And then we can swap...

3898
03:56:48,910 --> 03:56:49,110
Lower.

3899
03:56:49,390 --> 03:56:50,090
Oh wait, I mean, sorry.

3900
03:56:50,210 --> 03:56:50,770
The other one.

3901
03:56:50,870 --> 03:56:51,310
The other one.

3902
03:56:51,450 --> 03:56:51,930
Whoopsie.

3903
03:56:54,130 --> 03:56:55,070
This one.

3904
03:56:56,770 --> 03:56:57,130
Lower!

3905
03:56:57,670 --> 03:56:57,910
Okay.

3906
03:57:00,730 --> 03:57:02,070
There we go.

3907
03:57:03,710 --> 03:57:04,390
There we go.

3908
03:57:05,250 --> 03:57:06,970
A torpedo looks serviceable.

3909
03:57:08,550 --> 03:57:09,650
Switching the switches.

3910
03:57:10,910 --> 03:57:12,590
I'll set on this end too.

3911
03:57:13,250 --> 03:57:13,850
Something's odd.

3912
03:57:14,690 --> 03:57:14,970
What is?

3913
03:57:15,570 --> 03:57:16,370
The command room.

3914
03:57:16,790 --> 03:57:18,130
It looks like it's slowly sinking.

3915
03:57:20,110 --> 03:57:21,950
Yeah, like it's completely run out of power.

3916
03:57:22,330 --> 03:57:23,110
I wonder what happened.

3917
03:57:23,730 --> 03:57:24,030
Uh-oh.

3918
03:57:24,230 --> 03:57:26,530
I don't know, but I guess I'll find out.

3919
03:57:27,310 --> 03:57:28,350
Okay, hop into the missile.

3920
03:57:28,730 --> 03:57:29,770
I'll launch it for you.

3921
03:57:30,270 --> 03:57:30,690
Thanks.

3922
03:57:34,530 --> 03:57:35,470
Here we go.

3923
03:57:35,990 --> 03:57:36,610
I'm scared.

3924
03:57:37,070 --> 03:57:38,450
Is Detective Jowd gonna be alive?

3925
03:57:38,950 --> 03:57:40,770
I've already set the torpedoes course.

3926
03:57:42,390 --> 03:57:45,050
It'll head toward the command room where Detective Jowd is.

3927
03:57:45,890 --> 03:57:48,630
12 seconds after launching, it'll pass by the command room
for an instant.

3928
03:57:49,550 --> 03:57:52,570
That instant will be your window of opportunity to jump over
to the command room.

3929
03:57:53,830 --> 03:57:54,350
Got it.

3930
03:57:56,050 --> 03:57:57,890
And then we'll find a way to come back and save you.

3931
03:57:58,710 --> 03:58:00,410
That'll probably be my last task tonight.

3932
03:58:01,110 --> 03:58:02,470
Just hold on until we get back.

3933
03:58:04,430 --> 03:58:06,370
Where is Evil Sissel?

3934
03:58:07,490 --> 03:58:09,570
He didn't... he didn't... he didn't show up?

3935
03:58:09,930 --> 03:58:10,830
Okay, come on, Missal.

3936
03:58:12,970 --> 03:58:14,430
Missile, you have to come with us.

3937
03:58:14,670 --> 03:58:15,830
Missile, you have to come with us.

3938
03:58:16,590 --> 03:58:16,710
Missile?

3939
03:58:17,830 --> 03:58:18,270
I...

3940
03:58:18,270 --> 03:58:19,370
I'm sorry.

3941
03:58:19,570 --> 03:58:20,230
I can't go.

3942
03:58:21,570 --> 03:58:21,850
What?

3943
03:58:22,930 --> 03:58:23,870
I just can't.

3944
03:58:23,970 --> 03:58:24,810
How could I leave?

3945
03:58:25,270 --> 03:58:27,470
I can't leave Miss Lynn and Miss Camilla behind.

3946
03:58:28,470 --> 03:58:29,570
I can't do it.

3947
03:58:30,630 --> 03:58:31,070
Missile.

3948
03:58:31,530 --> 03:58:34,190
I swapped the switches so the missile can be launched.

3949
03:58:35,030 --> 03:58:36,350
You'll have to do the rest, Sisile.

3950
03:58:40,460 --> 03:58:41,880
I can't do it either.

3951
03:58:43,500 --> 03:58:45,260
Missal to come with me after that.

3952
03:58:46,600 --> 03:58:48,520
I understand exactly how he feels.

3953
03:58:49,420 --> 03:58:50,620
Yeah, bring Evil Sisal!

3954
03:58:52,060 --> 03:58:53,320
Come with us, Evil Sisal!

3955
03:58:54,960 --> 03:58:55,260
Okay.

3956
03:58:55,620 --> 03:58:57,100
Oh, I guess we're gonna go.

3957
03:58:58,040 --> 03:58:59,260
I want you to go, Missal.

3958
03:59:00,120 --> 03:59:00,340
What?

3959
03:59:00,460 --> 03:59:01,120
But Miss Lynn!

3960
03:59:01,900 --> 03:59:03,840
You staying here won't change our fate.

3961
03:59:04,660 --> 03:59:08,500
But if you go with Sisal, you might be able to make
something happen.

3962
03:59:08,900 --> 03:59:09,960
And that's our only hope.

3963
03:59:11,640 --> 03:59:13,400
But what if that something doesn't happen?

3964
03:59:14,180 --> 03:59:24,240
I'll never be able to see you again Never ever again Even I
can understand that I couldn't stand that Don't worry,

3965
03:59:24,460 --> 03:59:34,460
Missal Miss Camilla I just know you and Sissy Can make
something happen, I believe in you I'll be right here

3966
03:59:34,460 --> 03:59:38,380
waiting for you We'll see each other then Don't worry

3967
03:59:42,760 --> 03:59:44,540
Miss Camilla Come below!

3968
03:59:46,280 --> 03:59:47,460
Here he goes.

3969
03:59:48,800 --> 03:59:50,540
That's a good boy, Missou.

3970
03:59:54,670 --> 03:59:57,010
Why'd you have to make such a lovable dog?

3971
03:59:59,230 --> 04:00:00,650
Are you ready?

3972
04:00:00,890 --> 04:00:03,610
Remember, it's 12 seconds after I throw this switch.

3973
04:00:04,730 --> 04:00:05,170
We're ready.

3974
04:00:07,090 --> 04:00:07,390
Okay.

3975
04:00:07,830 --> 04:00:08,530
I'm ready.

3976
04:00:08,850 --> 04:00:09,190
I hope.

3977
04:00:10,870 --> 04:00:12,490
It's gonna count down for me, right?

3978
04:00:13,650 --> 04:00:14,250
Cicel?

3979
04:00:16,130 --> 04:00:24,350
yes we never found out who you really were but that doesn't
matter now all I know is I'm truly glad I met you tonight

3980
04:00:24,350 --> 04:00:33,030
thank you for everything and I'm glad I met you detective
but we're going to see each other again right sissy right

3981
04:00:33,030 --> 04:00:44,550
missile that's right we promise little lady of course we
will I'll never forget you no matter what happens this is

3982
04:00:44,550 --> 04:00:52,490
such a death flag oh my god here goes then don't promise
anything good luck friend no

3983
04:01:11,280 --> 04:01:19,780
these 12 seconds are lasting in eternity i strive to think
of a way to save lynn and the little lady the whole time but

3984
04:01:19,780 --> 04:01:25,400
how can a ray of light a ray of hope reach this far down
into the deep sea.

3985
04:01:26,080 --> 04:01:28,040
Before I can think of an answer, the 12 seconds are up.

3986
04:01:30,660 --> 04:01:30,940
Whoa!

3987
04:01:32,960 --> 04:01:33,240
Woo!

3988
04:01:34,660 --> 04:01:35,420
Uh-oh.

3989
04:01:36,900 --> 04:01:37,880
There they go.

3990
04:01:47,660 --> 04:01:48,540
Detective Jowd!

3991
04:01:49,000 --> 04:01:51,280
I bet that big masked man did this.

3992
04:01:51,700 --> 04:01:52,660
I'm going to bite him.

3993
04:01:53,240 --> 04:01:54,300
Yeah, you bite him.

3994
04:01:54,580 --> 04:01:55,060
You better not.

3995
04:01:55,140 --> 04:01:56,080
You might break your teeth.

3996
04:01:56,860 --> 04:01:58,780
The command room has lost power and is sinking.

3997
04:01:59,460 --> 04:02:01,420
So I wonder what this masked man is going to do.

3998
04:02:02,220 --> 04:02:11,100
himself he's going to sacrifice himself no you can't let's
talk to detective jowd

3999
04:02:17,080 --> 04:02:27,580
sorry for the wait detective jowd who are you are you sizzle
please excuse my appearance I can't believe you made it here

4000
04:02:27,580 --> 04:02:33,580
how is Camilla and what about Lynn well it's kind of a long
story

4001
04:02:38,200 --> 04:02:42,040
Then that's how they explain it really quickly in Animal
Crossing talk.

4002
04:02:42,840 --> 04:02:47,060
I told Detective Jad about everything that happened on the
submarine, Yo Mama.

4003
04:02:48,600 --> 04:02:50,140
So the submarine is badly damaged?

4004
04:02:51,020 --> 04:02:53,780
Oh, why would he do that to his own submarine?

4005
04:02:55,140 --> 04:02:56,040
I wish I knew.

4006
04:02:57,480 --> 04:02:59,320
I know the answer to that one.

4007
04:03:00,460 --> 04:03:00,700
Whoa!

4008
04:03:01,640 --> 04:03:03,240
It's because he's afraid of my powers.

4009
04:03:03,540 --> 04:03:05,680
Hey, excuse me?

4010
04:03:05,980 --> 04:03:06,280
You!

4011
04:03:07,040 --> 04:03:07,640
You!

4012
04:03:08,200 --> 04:03:08,760
You followed us?

4013
04:03:08,880 --> 04:03:09,620
I didn't even notice.

4014
04:03:11,040 --> 04:03:13,260
It's been 10 long years, Detective Jowd.

4015
04:03:17,280 --> 04:03:18,400
Are you...

4016
04:03:18,400 --> 04:03:19,040
Yo-Miel?

4017
04:03:21,720 --> 04:03:22,720
Yo-Miel?

4018
04:03:23,080 --> 04:03:23,500
Yo-Miel?

4019
04:03:30,760 --> 04:03:32,840
So you remember me, do you?

4020
04:03:35,520 --> 04:03:37,300
How could I possibly forget?

4021
04:03:38,800 --> 04:03:40,400
So that's your real name, huh?

4022
04:03:42,000 --> 04:03:55,570
that's interesting that's right but those people on on the
Yonoa were calling you sisal that's just an alias I was

4023
04:03:55,570 --> 04:04:04,430
using for my deal with them I didn't see any need to tell
them my real name could you do me a favor would you let me

4024
04:04:04,430 --> 04:04:13,070
ask you some questions I've been trying to find out my true
identity all night Yomiel is named after a fallen angel and

4025
04:04:13,070 --> 04:04:15,130
Yomi, the Shinto land of the dead.

4026
04:04:16,350 --> 04:04:22,470
In Shu Takumi tradition, most character names in the game
are puns and references, in this case related to death.

4027
04:04:23,150 --> 04:04:26,550
Ah, ah, ah, interesting, interesting.

4028
04:04:28,890 --> 04:04:30,870
It's Yomiyeru, so yep, you're reading it right.

4029
04:04:31,210 --> 04:04:31,730
Okay, nice.

4030
04:04:31,870 --> 04:04:32,290
Thank you.

4031
04:04:33,350 --> 04:04:34,090
Sure, go ahead.

4032
04:04:34,570 --> 04:04:37,010
I'm sure there's plenty we can still tell you, right,
Detective Jowd?

4033
04:04:38,110 --> 04:04:38,470
Right.

4034
04:04:39,630 --> 04:04:40,570
About Yomiya.

4035
04:04:41,550 --> 04:04:42,690
10 years ago.

4036
04:04:44,070 --> 04:04:46,510
You were a top systems engineer, weren't you?

4037
04:04:47,670 --> 04:04:48,370
Systems engineer?

4038
04:04:48,770 --> 04:04:49,330
What's that?

4039
04:04:50,330 --> 04:04:52,430
By the way, I'm a top Pomeranian, you know?

4040
04:04:55,010 --> 04:04:56,550
Yes, you are, Missal.

4041
04:04:57,490 --> 04:05:01,330
Well, it's kind of hard to explain to a dog, but it's a
person who's good at using computers.

4042
04:05:03,090 --> 04:05:05,570
I don't mean to brag, but I was one of the best in the
industry.

4043
04:05:05,890 --> 04:05:07,690
Oh my God, he's a hacker.

4044
04:05:08,870 --> 04:05:11,430
That's how I got roped into joining that project.

4045
04:05:12,290 --> 04:05:21,510
project what project it was a project aimed at reorganizing
the nation's top secret information the goal was to build a

4046
04:05:21,510 --> 04:05:31,610
new system using multi-dimensional programming theory I was
asked to join the project by an agent of the government it

4047
04:05:31,610 --> 04:05:38,430
doesn't sound like something a top Pomeranian would know
anything about to me it just sounded like another

4048
04:05:38,430 --> 04:05:43,010
challenging job Hacker man.

4049
04:05:43,590 --> 04:05:48,250
However, this project was also the target of a secret plot.

4050
04:05:49,310 --> 04:05:53,090
I bet you can imagine the kind of crime the nation's top
secrets might attract.

4051
04:05:55,530 --> 04:06:00,210
I never thought for the life of me I'd ever have to deal
with spies.

4052
04:06:04,380 --> 04:06:08,720
It was never made public, but every organization in the
country moved on this one.

4053
04:06:09,540 --> 04:06:13,180
And then one day, the name of a certain programmer emerged
as a suspect.

4054
04:06:13,360 --> 04:06:27,480
I was the guy who built the core of the system The police
arrested you and then that incident happened He escaped from

4055
04:06:27,480 --> 04:06:34,940
the interrogation room and took little Lynn as a hostage
Hold on one second I gotta check something real quick guys

4056
04:06:34,940 --> 04:06:54,390
sorry Okay Never mind I never got an answer By the way,
Detective Jowd.

4057
04:06:56,830 --> 04:06:58,450
When was it that I was proven innocent?

4058
04:06:59,510 --> 04:07:01,150
About six months after your death.

4059
04:07:01,990 --> 04:07:02,930
I'm so sorry, Yomiya.

4060
04:07:04,150 --> 04:07:05,210
He was framed.

4061
04:07:06,610 --> 04:07:07,930
Real motive for revenge.

4062
04:07:08,630 --> 04:07:09,450
Ten years ago.

4063
04:07:19,900 --> 04:07:22,600
My soul was split from my body and I lost everything.

4064
04:07:24,520 --> 04:07:26,260
I was sealed in eternal darkness.

4065
04:07:28,680 --> 04:07:29,060
Wow!

4066
04:07:29,480 --> 04:07:30,080
Look at him go!

4067
04:07:30,900 --> 04:07:33,700
I existed in this world, no question about that.

4068
04:07:37,840 --> 04:07:39,640
But nobody noticed my presence.

4069
04:07:39,880 --> 04:07:40,540
Look at him go!

4070
04:07:44,910 --> 04:07:46,490
What good were my powers?

4071
04:07:46,770 --> 04:07:48,010
They didn't help anybody.

4072
04:07:51,950 --> 04:07:54,630
Not even the passage of time to heal my pain.

4073
04:07:58,770 --> 04:08:01,190
In fact, it only made it worse.

4074
04:08:08,630 --> 04:08:10,270
I wanted to disappear.

4075
04:08:12,830 --> 04:08:14,310
I wasn't even allowed to do that.

4076
04:08:16,350 --> 04:08:18,450
The way Lynn described it is exactly right.

4077
04:08:19,470 --> 04:08:22,290
Sinking slowly toward the bottom of an endless sea.

4078
04:08:24,550 --> 04:08:27,370
An overwhelming feeling of loneliness and despair.

4079
04:08:29,550 --> 04:08:32,150
And I wanted all of you to suffer what I was suffering.

4080
04:08:33,670 --> 04:08:34,030
Aww.

4081
04:08:35,790 --> 04:08:37,850
And so that's why you murdered Alma.

4082
04:08:39,050 --> 04:08:39,630
That's right.

4083
04:08:40,270 --> 04:08:43,970
I wanted you to know what it was like to lose everything
everything you cared about.

4084
04:08:45,050 --> 04:08:47,270
I wanted you to feel the same pain I felt.

4085
04:08:50,570 --> 04:08:52,850
But that's not entirely right, right?

4086
04:08:54,590 --> 04:08:57,950
It was the twisted wish of a mind poisoned by infinite
loneliness.

4087
04:08:58,510 --> 04:08:58,690
Yeah.

4088
04:09:01,150 --> 04:09:04,890
And then, as I was plotting my revenge, I had an idea.

4089
04:09:06,810 --> 04:09:10,250
I came up with a plan to use these powers of mind to make a
deal.

4090
04:09:12,830 --> 04:09:13,610
The deal.

4091
04:09:14,510 --> 04:09:15,590
What's the deal?

4092
04:09:16,410 --> 04:09:18,450
What's the deal with Ghost Trick?

4093
04:09:20,590 --> 04:09:23,210
There's something I just don't understand about that deal.

4094
04:09:25,090 --> 04:09:27,430
I'm sure your powers would be very valuable to them.

4095
04:09:28,650 --> 04:09:31,230
But what would you get out of the deal?

4096
04:09:32,850 --> 04:09:33,790
A new life.

4097
04:09:34,650 --> 04:09:35,070
Life.

4098
04:09:35,930 --> 04:09:37,430
I asked them for two conditions.

4099
04:09:38,770 --> 04:09:41,210
Number one was that they helped me with my revenge plot.

4100
04:09:42,830 --> 04:09:44,830
And the second was a rebirth for me.

4101
04:09:46,430 --> 04:09:46,670
Rebirth.

4102
04:09:47,210 --> 04:09:48,130
A new beginning, eh?

4103
04:09:48,990 --> 04:09:52,390
I didn't care if it was a fake life, an artificial life.

4104
04:09:52,970 --> 04:09:58,850
I just wanted a physical receptacle for my soul, a name, an
identity, an everyday life.

4105
04:09:59,390 --> 04:10:02,050
I wanted to grow old in a society that would accept me.

4106
04:10:02,650 --> 04:10:06,030
And finally, I wanted to die, surrounded by a loving family.

4107
04:10:08,550 --> 04:10:10,970
That's the kind of life I asked them for.

4108
04:10:12,930 --> 04:10:15,170
A completely man-made life.

4109
04:10:17,210 --> 04:10:17,530
Step one.

4110
04:10:17,850 --> 04:10:18,150
Revenge.

4111
04:10:18,590 --> 04:10:19,070
Step two.

4112
04:10:19,610 --> 04:10:20,550
Become baby.

4113
04:10:22,330 --> 04:10:23,170
That's right.

4114
04:10:23,730 --> 04:10:25,750
I knew I couldn't hope for anything more than that.

4115
04:10:27,070 --> 04:10:30,490
To make it all come true, I knew it would take a lot of
money and a lot of power.

4116
04:10:31,790 --> 04:10:35,130
That's why I decided to ask a national government to help
me.

4117
04:10:35,970 --> 04:10:38,690
And the response in the end was betrayal.

4118
04:10:42,010 --> 04:10:42,530
Betrayal.

4119
04:10:45,210 --> 04:10:48,450
They were making their moves much more carefully than I
suspected.

4120
04:10:49,330 --> 04:10:52,610
They sent spies to this country and researched my powers on
their own.

4121
04:10:54,610 --> 04:10:57,550
And they even figured out what Temsik was all about.

4122
04:10:59,250 --> 04:11:01,010
And you had no idea they were doing all this?

4123
04:11:02,010 --> 04:11:02,530
None at all.

4124
04:11:03,050 --> 04:11:03,910
I was a fool.

4125
04:11:06,270 --> 04:11:10,850
So then, why did they go to all the trouble of making a deal
with you?

4126
04:11:12,890 --> 04:11:16,710
Why didn't they just steal a hunk of the Temsik meteorite
from the park?

4127
04:11:19,410 --> 04:11:20,730
They couldn't.

4128
04:11:20,810 --> 04:11:20,950
Huh?

4129
04:11:22,070 --> 04:11:22,870
Oh, oh?

4130
04:11:24,210 --> 04:11:28,690
After the manipulator incidents, research was conducted in
this country too.

4131
04:11:31,950 --> 04:11:36,190
A report was submitted to the government about the source of
the manipulator's power.

4132
04:11:39,580 --> 04:11:40,060
Okay.

4133
04:11:41,720 --> 04:11:44,480
By Inspector Cabanela and the old pigeon guy, eh?

4134
04:11:44,580 --> 04:11:57,580
at first the government didn't believe the report but then
they decided to put put the park under surveillance just in

4135
04:11:57,580 --> 04:12:05,920
case wait it's not the hippie guy is it surveillance huh it
looks like an ordinary peaceful park but there are armed

4136
04:12:05,920 --> 04:12:18,180
agents there at all times like him don't tell me that odd
leaflet guy is one of them no not him he's just a plain old

4137
04:12:18,180 --> 04:12:29,500
odd person okay he's just a weirdo just a weirdo everybody
nothing to see here that park is like a silent battlefield

4138
04:12:29,500 --> 04:12:37,980
on an international scale so that's why they couldn't steal
the Temsic meteorite and lately under the pretense of

4139
04:12:37,980 --> 04:12:48,020
building a housing site they've been working on a plan to
destroy that park in order to secure the Oh, so that's it.

4140
04:12:49,440 --> 04:12:53,760
So the upshot of your grand deal was this, eh?

4141
04:12:54,760 --> 04:12:55,060
Yeah.

4142
04:12:55,820 --> 04:12:57,040
It's the ending I deserve.

4143
04:12:58,160 --> 04:13:00,280
But at least there's one thing you must be happy about.

4144
04:13:01,260 --> 04:13:01,840
What's that?

4145
04:13:03,640 --> 04:13:06,500
You've managed to seal me away at the bottom of the sea
forever.

4146
04:13:10,000 --> 04:13:11,620
Well, shall we get started?

4147
04:13:11,620 --> 04:13:13,620
It started with what?

4148
04:13:14,740 --> 04:13:16,640
Bringing Detective Jowd back to life, of course.

4149
04:13:17,560 --> 04:13:17,560
What?

4150
04:13:17,940 --> 04:13:19,240
What good will that do now?

4151
04:13:20,620 --> 04:13:21,960
But we promised.

4152
04:13:22,840 --> 04:13:25,300
We promised Miss Lynn and Miss Camilla we'd save them.

4153
04:13:26,660 --> 04:13:28,600
Then we can't do that without you, Detective Jowd.

4154
04:13:30,240 --> 04:13:32,480
I've been guided by fate tonight to this place.

4155
04:13:33,080 --> 04:13:33,960
I won't give up now.

4156
04:13:35,100 --> 04:13:35,820
Alright, fine.

4157
04:13:36,560 --> 04:13:37,740
Let's see where it leads us.

4158
04:13:38,000 --> 04:13:39,880
Oh, gosh, there's so much reading, you guys.

4159
04:13:39,940 --> 04:13:40,740
I'm getting so tired.

4160
04:13:40,820 --> 04:13:41,320
I'm sorry.

4161
04:13:47,960 --> 04:13:49,080
Here we go, then.

4162
04:13:49,320 --> 04:13:50,820
Back to four minutes before your death.

4163
04:13:57,300 --> 04:13:58,800
Trying to get hungry, too.

4164
04:13:59,600 --> 04:14:00,340
You're almost at the end.

4165
04:14:00,460 --> 04:14:01,960
We have one more chapter after this.

4166
04:14:03,560 --> 04:14:07,740
But this shouldn't be so much reading, probably, because
we're figuring out the puzzle.

4167
04:14:09,960 --> 04:14:10,360
GAMBARE!

4168
04:14:11,020 --> 04:14:11,680
Thank you!

4169
04:14:13,040 --> 04:14:14,300
So, where are we headed?

4170
04:14:14,340 --> 04:14:17,440
We are not headed anywhere, detective.

4171
04:14:22,080 --> 04:14:25,220
For the mystery of Cicil identity, you have been given all
the clues needed.

4172
04:14:25,540 --> 04:14:27,700
Take a hot minute before diving into the final chapter.

4173
04:14:28,240 --> 04:14:29,620
For chat, hush, no spoilers.

4174
04:14:30,120 --> 04:14:30,700
No, it's okay.

4175
04:14:31,160 --> 04:14:33,260
I think I will just go into the final chapter.

4176
04:14:33,420 --> 04:14:33,920
It's no worries.

4177
04:14:35,560 --> 04:14:36,860
I want to see what they...

4178
04:14:36,860 --> 04:14:38,320
I think I've cooked enough.

4179
04:14:39,380 --> 04:14:39,600
You know?

4180
04:14:39,760 --> 04:14:42,360
I think I want to see what the answer is.

4181
04:14:43,240 --> 04:14:43,460
Oh.

4182
04:14:44,060 --> 04:14:44,500
What?

4183
04:14:45,340 --> 04:14:48,440
There was only enough fuel on board to launch us away,
detective.

4184
04:14:49,380 --> 04:14:52,380
We will run out soon and that will be our destination,
detective.

4185
04:14:52,600 --> 04:14:54,880
Wait, does this guy actually just sacrifice himself?

4186
04:14:55,580 --> 04:14:56,440
What are you talking about?

4187
04:14:56,520 --> 04:14:57,340
That would mean...

4188
04:14:58,060 --> 04:14:59,260
That you're trapped here too!

4189
04:15:04,640 --> 04:15:07,080
By the way, I am not human, detective.

4190
04:15:12,830 --> 04:15:16,210
I am a remote-controlled robot, detective!

4191
04:15:16,730 --> 04:15:16,930
No!

4192
04:15:20,050 --> 04:15:20,490
What?

4193
04:15:22,610 --> 04:15:26,530
Your country's use of technology is just playing off.

4194
04:15:27,570 --> 04:15:29,010
We get that a lot, detective.

4195
04:15:31,810 --> 04:15:33,210
Um, I don't know.

4196
04:15:33,830 --> 04:15:37,830
Uh, give me robot girls and I'm in, actually.

4197
04:15:39,950 --> 04:15:42,630
Why would you go to all the trouble to do this?

4198
04:15:44,390 --> 04:15:46,230
That's nothing but a shell there.

4199
04:15:47,030 --> 04:15:48,090
It's hardly a threat anymore.

4200
04:15:48,950 --> 04:15:51,350
Commander Sith likes to provide any...

4201
04:15:51,970 --> 04:15:54,610
Any possibility, no matter how small, detective.

4202
04:15:57,390 --> 04:15:57,830
Possibility.

4203
04:15:58,370 --> 04:15:59,390
Yeah, we got robot girls.

4204
04:15:59,590 --> 04:16:00,270
We have blue women.

4205
04:16:01,130 --> 04:16:03,530
I think this other country is great.

4206
04:16:06,250 --> 04:16:08,170
And where's my robot girls at?

4207
04:16:09,130 --> 04:16:10,470
What are you talking about?

4208
04:16:11,550 --> 04:16:13,430
There's no need for you to know, detective.

4209
04:16:15,730 --> 04:16:16,350
Smack.

4210
04:16:19,730 --> 04:16:20,350
Oh!

4211
04:16:20,950 --> 04:16:21,210
Oh!

4212
04:16:22,550 --> 04:16:24,710
Now it's time to say goodbye, detective.

4213
04:16:25,410 --> 04:16:26,510
Murph, thanks for a month.

4214
04:16:27,210 --> 04:16:27,790
Thank you.

4215
04:16:29,050 --> 04:16:31,130
In the end, your fate remains the same, it seems.

4216
04:16:32,810 --> 04:16:33,250
Grr.

4217
04:16:34,090 --> 04:16:34,570
Grr.

4218
04:16:35,350 --> 04:16:35,830
Camilla.

4219
04:16:36,450 --> 04:16:37,430
Forgive me.

4220
04:16:39,870 --> 04:16:41,110
Maybe Shaggy's a robot.

4221
04:16:41,710 --> 04:16:41,790
Good.

4222
04:16:41,890 --> 04:16:43,870
I can't wait to dismantle that guy.

4223
04:16:44,250 --> 04:16:45,450
To teeny tiny pieces.

4224
04:16:45,870 --> 04:16:47,170
By every little bit and bot.

4225
04:16:48,050 --> 04:16:48,850
It's not over yet.

4226
04:16:49,090 --> 04:16:50,090
Not yet, Jowd.

4227
04:16:50,150 --> 04:16:50,890
It's not over yet.

4228
04:16:52,270 --> 04:16:55,110
Remember what that big mask man said?

4229
04:16:55,550 --> 04:16:57,450
Any possibility, no matter how small.

4230
04:16:58,510 --> 04:16:58,870
Possibility.

4231
04:16:59,510 --> 04:17:01,510
In other words, there must be a chance here somewhere.

4232
04:17:02,350 --> 04:17:04,470
The possibility of turning this situation around.

4233
04:17:07,850 --> 04:17:09,090
Do we get other powers?

4234
04:17:09,550 --> 04:17:11,310
Do we get the powers of...

4235
04:17:12,290 --> 04:17:14,490
Do we get the powers of manipulation?

4236
04:17:16,690 --> 04:17:18,470
Okay, let's see what we got here.

4237
04:17:19,450 --> 04:17:19,670
Huh?

4238
04:17:20,350 --> 04:17:21,410
What is it, Detective?

4239
04:17:21,970 --> 04:17:23,590
Look at Yomiya's shell.

4240
04:17:24,890 --> 04:17:26,890
There's no aura emanating from his body.

4241
04:17:27,770 --> 04:17:28,790
Of course there isn't.

4242
04:17:29,030 --> 04:17:30,350
The Temsik fragment is gone.

4243
04:17:31,430 --> 04:17:33,910
Could this change in his shell give us some kind of lead?

4244
04:17:40,550 --> 04:17:41,950
I figured it out.

4245
04:17:44,170 --> 04:17:46,490
I know what this possibility no matter...

4246
04:17:46,490 --> 04:17:47,270
That was fast.

4247
04:17:48,710 --> 04:17:54,570
This possibility no matter small, no matter how small, is
that they are afraid of.

4248
04:17:54,710 --> 04:17:54,850
What?

4249
04:17:54,870 --> 04:17:55,970
What is it?

4250
04:17:56,050 --> 04:17:56,790
That was so fast.

4251
04:17:57,370 --> 04:17:58,930
My time was perpetually stopped.

4252
04:17:59,110 --> 04:18:00,370
Thanks to the power of Temsik.

4253
04:18:01,390 --> 04:18:04,710
His body cycled between the moments that separated his life
and death.

4254
04:18:06,350 --> 04:18:08,070
But not anymore.

4255
04:18:10,910 --> 04:18:11,390
Can we?

4256
04:18:11,730 --> 04:18:11,950
Wait.

4257
04:18:13,870 --> 04:18:16,490
The Temsik fragment has been taken away.

4258
04:18:17,790 --> 04:18:18,730
So what does that mean?

4259
04:18:20,190 --> 04:18:20,670
No.

4260
04:18:21,710 --> 04:18:22,930
I get it.

4261
04:18:23,910 --> 04:18:33,110
Your body won't come back to life anymore the moment the
Temsic fragment was removed my shell became a regular corpse

4262
04:18:33,110 --> 04:18:49,650
that means we can we can go back four minutes before your
death but wait a minute exactly when is that death ten years

4263
04:18:49,650 --> 04:18:55,910
ago that's simple we'll find out when we get there Let's
move!

4264
04:18:57,030 --> 04:18:59,670
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my
god!

4265
04:19:02,630 --> 04:19:04,870
How do we stop a whole ass meteor?

4266
04:19:11,880 --> 04:19:15,320
I fell back through the cracks of time for what seemed like
forever.

4267
04:19:15,820 --> 04:19:16,680
And then I saw it.

4268
04:19:17,020 --> 04:19:17,900
The final death.

4269
04:19:18,240 --> 04:19:19,860
At the end of this long night!

4270
04:19:21,420 --> 04:19:22,580
Who exactly am I?

4271
04:19:22,980 --> 04:19:24,460
I've already seen all the clues.

4272
04:19:24,780 --> 04:19:26,100
All I have to do now is remember!

4273
04:19:29,160 --> 04:19:33,660
The final journey to the truth starts now.

4274
04:19:38,780 --> 04:19:39,460
Oh, oh!

4275
04:19:40,140 --> 04:19:42,100
Okay, final chapter, everybody.

4276
04:19:44,780 --> 04:19:46,520
Four minutes before death variation.

4277
04:19:47,880 --> 04:19:48,440
Oh, cool!

4278
04:19:49,540 --> 04:19:50,540
Oh, awesome!

4279
04:19:51,900 --> 04:19:53,340
Okay, here we go, everybody.

4280
04:19:56,640 --> 04:19:57,780
Last chapter.

4281
04:19:59,280 --> 04:20:00,300
Final chapter.

4282
04:20:02,980 --> 04:20:04,600
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

4283
04:20:07,160 --> 04:20:08,480
When was Yomiel's death?

4284
04:20:09,180 --> 04:20:11,700
It was 10 years ago when the Tempsic meteorite fell.

4285
04:20:19,050 --> 04:20:22,610
We traveled back through time, and now we're here at the
scene of that death.

4286
04:20:23,070 --> 04:20:25,370
The start of it all is about to replay itself.

4287
04:20:26,050 --> 04:20:26,950
Oh my gosh.

4288
04:20:28,770 --> 04:20:30,150
Here comes the meteor.

4289
04:20:31,270 --> 04:20:32,730
Four minutes before death.

4290
04:20:35,010 --> 04:20:36,550
Oh wow, what a pretty park.

4291
04:20:39,590 --> 04:20:53,410
so she's jamming it's whoa oh my gosh she was making she was

4293
04:21:03,130 --> 04:21:09,070
that weapon stay back if you come any closer thank you You
can already get who you are.

4294
04:21:09,210 --> 04:21:10,390
I have no idea anymore.

4295
04:21:10,850 --> 04:21:11,610
I'll shoot her.

4296
04:21:20,020 --> 04:21:21,060
Oh, baby.

4297
04:21:22,240 --> 04:21:22,360
Huh?

4298
04:21:22,640 --> 04:21:23,160
Oh, a kitten.

4299
04:21:23,400 --> 04:21:23,740
Show you.

4300
04:21:24,120 --> 04:21:25,100
Random cat.

4301
04:21:25,440 --> 04:21:26,360
You might get hurt.

4302
04:21:29,680 --> 04:21:30,120
Whoa!

4303
04:21:31,060 --> 04:21:31,820
It's beautiful.

4304
04:21:32,000 --> 04:21:32,700
Oh, my gosh.

4305
04:21:37,620 --> 04:21:40,920
And then the whole human race was extinct.

4306
04:21:46,890 --> 04:21:48,590
Oh, okay.

4307
04:21:49,290 --> 04:21:51,090
Is that going to have to do something with it somehow?

4308
04:21:56,950 --> 04:21:57,950
Stellar, stellar.

4309
04:22:01,830 --> 04:22:03,330
The cat's okay, right?

4310
04:22:04,370 --> 04:22:04,910
Are you okay?

4311
04:22:05,950 --> 04:22:07,290
The cat's okay, right?

4312
04:22:08,990 --> 04:22:10,050
Where'd the cat go?

4313
04:22:11,090 --> 04:22:12,270
You're all right now.

4314
04:22:12,650 --> 04:22:13,150
Are you hurt?

4315
04:22:14,350 --> 04:22:17,060
You saved me, Mr. Oh wait, hold on.

4316
04:22:20,550 --> 04:22:22,390
You saved me, mister.

4317
04:22:26,310 --> 04:22:28,070
I was just doing my job.

4318
04:22:29,150 --> 04:22:32,930
The gods, they're the ones who saved you.

4319
04:22:36,620 --> 04:22:37,700
What's your job, mister?

4320
04:22:43,270 --> 04:22:43,630
Me?

4321
04:22:44,170 --> 04:22:45,850
I'm a police detective.

4322
04:22:51,360 --> 04:23:02,420
so that's the Temsic radio right it's beautiful looking at
it oh it's beautiful looking at it from this angle it

4323
04:23:02,420 --> 04:23:11,660
changed all of our fates completely we can't stop Temsic
from falling from the sky but we might be able to protect

4324
04:23:11,660 --> 04:23:18,700
you from the fragment and save your life I'm so glad you
played one of my favorite games.

4325
04:23:18,800 --> 04:23:20,240
The gameplay and story is 10 out of 10.

4326
04:23:20,580 --> 04:23:22,240
How people play more games like this in the future.

4327
04:23:22,580 --> 04:23:23,960
Also, 10 out of 10 voice acting.

4328
04:23:24,380 --> 04:23:25,060
Thank you.

4329
04:23:26,780 --> 04:23:28,200
Thank you so much to the Super Chat.

4330
04:23:29,540 --> 04:23:30,160
I don't know.

4331
04:23:31,040 --> 04:23:32,340
What's the matter, Detective Jowler?

4332
04:23:34,800 --> 04:23:37,060
To be perfectly honest, I'm scared.

4333
04:23:37,800 --> 04:23:41,680
If that meteorite fragment doesn't get him, I'm pretty sure
I would have shot him.

4334
04:23:43,940 --> 04:23:46,260
We might not be able to change your fate of dying.

4335
04:23:48,280 --> 04:23:49,740
I can accept that.

4336
04:23:52,220 --> 04:23:54,080
What I did is inexcusable.

4337
04:23:54,860 --> 04:23:58,000
No matter how the future might change, that fact will never
go away.

4338
04:23:59,100 --> 04:24:00,200
It's my fate to die here.

4339
04:24:00,580 --> 04:24:01,520
Then I accept that.

4340
04:24:02,000 --> 04:24:04,320
Oh, if my fate is to die here, then I accept that.

4341
04:24:08,640 --> 04:24:10,620
This will be our last battle against fate.

4342
04:24:11,940 --> 04:24:13,620
Beyond that will be a new future.

4343
04:24:14,680 --> 04:24:15,820
Okay, let's get started!

4344
04:24:17,300 --> 04:24:18,600
Meso is still here.

4345
04:24:18,680 --> 04:24:19,440
I'm so happy.

4346
04:24:20,220 --> 04:24:24,700
Okay, I feel like we're gonna have to probably use Missile's
powers to swap something, right?

4347
04:24:28,280 --> 04:24:28,760
Um...

4348
04:24:30,540 --> 04:24:32,800
All right, let's see what we got here.

4349
04:24:33,720 --> 04:24:35,260
We can't... I can't reach.

4350
04:24:39,160 --> 04:24:40,980
Missile just hanging out in the basket.

4351
04:24:41,600 --> 04:24:42,300
We got a nozzle.

4352
04:24:44,840 --> 04:24:46,120
Maybe we have to shoot the...

4353
04:24:50,220 --> 04:24:50,840
Sweet potato!

4354
04:24:50,980 --> 04:24:55,900
Oh, I want to roast the sweet potatoes so badly right now!

4355
04:24:56,440 --> 04:24:57,120
Headphones.

4356
04:24:58,180 --> 04:24:58,600
Okay.

4357
04:25:00,200 --> 04:25:01,900
We don't have much going on here.

4358
04:25:06,860 --> 04:25:07,540
It's ready!

4359
04:25:09,620 --> 04:25:10,960
Let's make it!

4360
04:25:12,100 --> 04:25:13,660
Let's make it!

4361
04:25:14,440 --> 04:25:15,260
Oh!

4362
04:25:16,160 --> 04:25:16,520
Okay.

4363
04:25:18,360 --> 04:25:18,840
Cat.

4364
04:25:20,940 --> 04:25:21,780
Okay.

4365
04:25:23,380 --> 04:25:24,660
Examine the sweet potato.

4366
04:25:25,420 --> 04:25:26,560
What in the world is this thing?

4367
04:25:26,720 --> 04:25:27,620
It's making me hungry.

4368
04:25:28,440 --> 04:25:37,040
What do you even forgot what a sweet potato is?

4369
04:25:37,720 --> 04:25:38,940
It's a roasted root vegetable.

4370
04:25:39,240 --> 04:25:39,680
That's good.

4371
04:25:40,240 --> 04:25:41,300
Oh my gosh.

4372
04:25:41,400 --> 04:25:44,760
If you've never had roasted sweet potato, it's one of the
best things ever.

4373
04:25:45,120 --> 04:25:45,840
So good.

4374
04:25:48,540 --> 04:25:50,560
There's nothing like them on a cold...

4375
04:25:50,560 --> 04:25:52,300
Like them on a cold winter's day.

4376
04:25:52,820 --> 04:25:54,940
They're sweet and they smell delicious.

4377
04:25:55,920 --> 04:25:57,500
These guys sure are making me want to try one.

4378
04:26:02,620 --> 04:26:04,180
I still can't reach.

4379
04:26:06,660 --> 04:26:06,740
Hmm.

4380
04:26:10,590 --> 04:26:12,850
I have to switch this and this.

4381
04:26:13,350 --> 04:26:15,650
I have to switch this and this, I think.

4382
04:26:16,050 --> 04:26:16,130
Right?

4383
04:26:28,700 --> 04:26:30,140
The god rock.

4384
04:26:30,360 --> 04:26:30,580
Yeah.

4385
04:26:31,440 --> 04:26:33,320
Can I go grab some food real quick?

4386
04:26:34,300 --> 04:26:34,700
Sorry.

4387
04:26:35,960 --> 04:26:39,860
It's already done, so I'm just gonna grab it.

4388
04:26:40,660 --> 04:26:43,980
I'll be two seconds to grab it.

4389
04:27:13,710 --> 04:27:15,970
Sorry, I started to get shaky all of a sudden.

4390
04:27:16,650 --> 04:27:17,610
Oh, I'm a hungry ghost.

4391
04:27:18,110 --> 04:27:19,330
Oh, I'm a hungry ghost.

4392
04:27:19,550 --> 04:27:20,190
I'm a hungry ghost.

4393
04:27:20,370 --> 04:27:20,930
I'm a hungry ghost.

4394
04:27:22,190 --> 04:27:23,890
I'm a hungry ghost.

4395
04:27:44,300 --> 04:27:45,960
Sorry, sorry for the break.

4396
04:27:47,380 --> 04:27:47,920
So sorry.

4397
04:27:48,580 --> 04:27:49,640
I wanna continue the story.

4398
04:27:49,780 --> 04:27:50,460
I wanna see what happens.

4399
04:27:51,180 --> 04:27:51,780
But I need break.

4400
04:27:51,800 --> 04:27:54,970
I mean it fueled for my for my mushy brain.

4401
04:28:04,740 --> 04:28:07,280
Sorry I won't be able to voice act this part anything.

4402
04:28:07,640 --> 04:28:08,260
Poor Miss Lin.

4403
04:28:09,000 --> 04:28:09,350
I'm sorry.

4404
04:28:12,880 --> 04:28:14,480
If you're so sorry then put her down.

4405
04:28:15,040 --> 04:28:16,400
I won't be able to voice act this.

4406
04:28:16,940 --> 04:28:18,180
Just reads it anyway.

4407
04:28:21,260 --> 04:28:22,400
Alright now Missil.

4408
04:28:27,030 --> 04:28:28,070
I was really out of my mind.

4409
04:28:28,090 --> 04:28:28,810
head that day.

4410
04:28:29,930 --> 04:28:31,170
We can talk about all this later.

4411
04:28:32,090 --> 04:28:33,830
A Temsec meteorite is gonna fall very soon.

4412
04:28:34,130 --> 04:28:37,010
Before that happens, I have to think of a way to do
something about that fragment.

4413
04:28:39,190 --> 04:28:41,330
And I'll do everything I can to help too.

4414
04:28:42,610 --> 04:28:49,310
Okay, um... We really don't have very many places we can go.

4415
04:28:53,570 --> 04:28:55,930
Let's have some more time pass.

4416
04:28:56,030 --> 04:28:56,870
Look at the cat!

4417
04:28:59,610 --> 04:29:01,230
Time is passing.

4418
04:29:04,010 --> 04:29:05,530
No, so cute!

4419
04:29:15,440 --> 04:29:17,360
Nothing else happens!

4420
04:29:23,950 --> 04:29:25,810
It's about time for that meteorite to come down!

4421
04:29:26,770 --> 04:29:27,010
Uh oh.

4422
04:29:27,390 --> 04:29:29,310
We have to change the fragment's path somehow!

4423
04:29:30,330 --> 04:29:34,330
Looks like both paths and fates can be difficult things to
change.

4424
04:29:35,750 --> 04:29:37,110
There has to be a way.

4425
04:29:37,710 --> 04:29:40,610
If we work together, you and me, I thought we'd be able to
do something.

4426
04:29:41,290 --> 04:29:41,610
Thought?

4427
04:29:41,970 --> 04:29:42,450
That's funny.

4428
04:29:42,810 --> 04:29:44,550
I wonder why he's using past tense.

4429
04:29:47,530 --> 04:29:48,010
Uh...

4430
04:29:50,070 --> 04:29:51,270
That's so cute!

4431
04:29:52,850 --> 04:29:54,110
Kind of reminds me...

4432
04:29:54,110 --> 04:29:55,310
It reminds me of Paus.

4433
04:30:08,020 --> 04:30:09,240
Okay, let's redo it.

4434
04:30:12,120 --> 04:30:13,940
So this is the start of it all, huh?

4435
04:30:14,220 --> 04:30:15,720
We can change Rute Yomiya's fate.

4436
04:30:15,920 --> 04:30:17,780
What will happen to everything else, I wonder?

4437
04:30:18,700 --> 04:30:20,560
It won't do us any good to think about that now.

4438
04:30:21,960 --> 04:30:23,960
We just have to take that first step forward.

4439
04:30:24,260 --> 04:30:25,520
Just as we always do.

4440
04:30:27,480 --> 04:30:27,960
Rewind!

4441
04:30:28,620 --> 04:30:29,180
Rewind!

4442
04:30:33,840 --> 04:30:34,400
Oh.

4443
04:30:37,020 --> 04:30:37,580
Okay.

4444
04:30:39,740 --> 04:30:42,860
I can't reach until he grabs her.

4445
04:30:44,220 --> 04:30:45,900
Why can't we switch around?

4446
04:31:00,480 --> 04:31:02,940
Is the basket and the...

4447
04:31:04,560 --> 04:31:05,100
The...

4448
04:31:05,100 --> 04:31:09,080
Are the basket and the sweet potato when she grabs them?

4449
04:31:09,160 --> 04:31:10,040
Are they the same shape?

4450
04:31:10,300 --> 04:31:11,940
Let's see.

4451
04:31:13,420 --> 04:31:16,420
Do they count as the same shape?

4452
04:31:27,080 --> 04:31:30,040
It was just that this cat just walks up.

4453
04:31:30,780 --> 04:31:31,500
So funny.

4454
04:31:32,920 --> 04:31:34,080
Oh, no, it doesn't.

4455
04:31:34,440 --> 04:31:34,640
Ah!

4456
04:31:38,160 --> 04:31:40,700
Oh, man, I already missed my opportunity, maybe.

4457
04:31:52,940 --> 04:31:54,460
We can examine the sweep.

4458
04:31:54,520 --> 04:31:55,940
Oh, we can turn up the headphones.

4459
04:31:56,100 --> 04:31:57,340
Oh, I didn't realize that.

4460
04:31:59,020 --> 04:32:00,520
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice.

4461
04:32:01,300 --> 04:32:01,860
What are you doing?

4462
04:32:01,940 --> 04:32:03,760
You're going to hurt poor Miss Lynn's ears!

4463
04:32:04,740 --> 04:32:05,940
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

4464
04:32:06,520 --> 04:32:07,480
You really startled her.

4465
04:32:08,520 --> 04:32:10,120
You could have even made her drop her sweet potato.

4466
04:32:12,820 --> 04:32:22,260
how much this girl loves her food too anyway at least her
fate has been changed I'll be ever so slightly okay I'm

4467
04:32:22,260 --> 04:32:32,780
going ghost okay nice nice nice we're gonna have you go all
the way not there oh wait we have to go from here to there

4468
04:32:32,780 --> 04:32:42,120
there we go okay we can rock the basket we can spray the
nozzle okay I was thinking that spray okay

4469
04:32:48,510 --> 04:32:50,290
Can I switch the nozzles?

4470
04:32:54,020 --> 04:32:55,020
Oh, I can't reach.

4471
04:32:55,880 --> 04:33:01,280
Because I'm gonna say if I could switch the nozzles, maybe
one will, they'll be, he could like, spray sisal, you know?

4472
04:33:02,500 --> 04:33:03,260
Oh, Raid!

4473
04:33:03,500 --> 04:33:04,140
Thank you!

4474
04:33:05,660 --> 04:33:06,060
Yuki!

4475
04:33:06,640 --> 04:33:08,120
Wait, oh gosh, I didn't see the other name.

4476
04:33:08,220 --> 04:33:08,720
I'm so sorry.

4477
04:33:08,980 --> 04:33:10,400
YouTube is really stupid right now.

4478
04:33:11,500 --> 04:33:15,840
And all raids come in a white text on white background, so I
can't read them.

4479
04:33:16,540 --> 04:33:17,340
Thank you!

4480
04:33:18,900 --> 04:33:19,960
Thank you so much to the raid!

4481
04:33:23,900 --> 04:33:25,380
Oh, Yuki and Yuna.

4482
04:33:25,960 --> 04:33:26,580
Thank you.

4483
04:33:28,700 --> 04:33:31,800
Right now, I'm in the final chapter of this game.

4484
04:33:32,380 --> 04:33:34,780
So, kind of major spoilers, but...

4485
04:33:35,940 --> 04:33:36,400
Welcome.

4486
04:33:44,650 --> 04:33:45,690
Let's see.

4487
04:33:46,910 --> 04:33:48,210
Marry, thanks for the gifted.

4488
04:33:48,930 --> 04:33:49,910
Let's rock this, I guess.

4489
04:33:49,970 --> 04:33:50,770
Let's see what happens here.

4490
04:33:51,830 --> 04:33:52,410
Rock the boat.

4491
04:33:54,270 --> 04:33:56,010
Oh, oh, and we showed it up.

4492
04:33:57,070 --> 04:33:59,470
Ghost, ghost, oh, whoops, wait, I pressed the wrong button.

4493
04:34:00,690 --> 04:34:01,270
What did I just press?

4494
04:34:01,450 --> 04:34:03,270
Oh, okay, that scared me.

4495
04:34:03,570 --> 04:34:05,250
Heart Underblade, thank you for the five gifted.

4496
04:34:05,870 --> 04:34:06,950
Shopkeeper, thank you for the five gifted.

4497
04:34:07,090 --> 04:34:07,790
Thank you guys.

4498
04:34:08,110 --> 04:34:09,530
Okay, oh, oh, oh, oh.

4499
04:34:09,610 --> 04:34:10,370
Here we go.

4500
04:34:10,890 --> 04:34:11,430
And shoot!

4501
04:34:12,350 --> 04:34:12,430
Oh.

4502
04:34:13,330 --> 04:34:13,730
Uh-oh.

4503
04:34:14,290 --> 04:34:15,790
Wait, I think I missed my opportunity.

4504
04:34:17,510 --> 04:34:18,710
That was kind of disappointing.

4505
04:34:19,090 --> 04:34:20,410
Maybe the timing was a little off.

4506
04:34:23,030 --> 04:34:24,250
I better try it again.

4507
04:34:27,050 --> 04:34:29,370
How do I...

4508
04:34:29,370 --> 04:34:31,070
Get it back over here though.

4509
04:34:32,370 --> 04:34:32,670
Ah!

4510
04:34:34,790 --> 04:34:37,750
Oh, I had it, but I didn't have it.

4511
04:34:38,430 --> 04:34:39,730
Okay, let's just restart.

4512
04:34:40,670 --> 04:34:41,930
After the fight change, okay.

4513
04:34:43,910 --> 04:34:44,950
Okay, okay, okay.

4514
04:34:45,870 --> 04:34:47,030
We have one chance.

4515
04:34:58,190 --> 04:34:59,430
Rock the boat.

4516
04:35:00,890 --> 04:35:01,750
And then go to here.

4517
04:35:02,430 --> 04:35:03,550
And then buck.

4518
04:35:04,750 --> 04:35:05,870
Oh my god, I can't see it!

4519
04:35:05,970 --> 04:35:06,210
Okay.

4520
04:35:08,730 --> 04:35:09,730
Go ghost.

4521
04:35:12,730 --> 04:35:13,430
Oh, okay.

4522
04:35:14,290 --> 04:35:15,690
Look at that sweet potato.

4523
04:35:19,370 --> 04:35:21,610
That big, scary sweet...

4524
04:35:21,610 --> 04:35:23,450
That big, scary sweet potato.

4525
04:35:24,670 --> 04:35:26,010
That's not a sweet potato missile.

4526
04:35:26,250 --> 04:35:26,950
That's minto.

4527
04:35:28,930 --> 04:35:30,450
You guys, I'm a sweet potato.

4528
04:35:33,690 --> 04:35:35,450
I can't believe I'm in the game.

4529
04:35:43,980 --> 04:35:45,040
Alright, of course.

4530
04:35:48,560 --> 04:35:49,180
But look at them.

4531
04:35:49,300 --> 04:35:50,260
The potato and mino.

4532
04:35:50,900 --> 04:35:52,420
Right now, they both have the same shape.

4533
04:35:53,360 --> 04:35:54,840
So you're saying you could swap them, huh?

4534
04:35:55,140 --> 04:35:56,060
Good idea, Missile.

4535
04:35:57,580 --> 04:35:58,280
Here I go.

4536
04:35:58,600 --> 04:35:59,820
And I'm gonna need your help.

4537
04:36:01,040 --> 04:36:01,520
My help.

4538
04:36:02,360 --> 04:36:03,580
Uh-oh, my help.

4539
04:36:03,800 --> 04:36:04,100
My help.

4540
04:36:04,380 --> 04:36:04,660
My help.

4541
04:36:06,140 --> 04:36:07,120
Oh, spray higher.

4542
04:36:08,060 --> 04:36:08,320
Be.

4543
04:36:13,680 --> 04:36:14,800
Wait a second.

4544
04:36:16,400 --> 04:36:17,280
Uh, no, no, wait.

4545
04:36:18,360 --> 04:36:19,160
Uh, wait, wait, wait.

4546
04:36:19,820 --> 04:36:20,200
Uh, wait.

4547
04:36:20,200 --> 04:36:23,340
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

4548
04:36:24,520 --> 04:36:25,220
Oh, wait, wait.

4549
04:36:25,220 --> 04:36:25,980
Oh, wait, wait.

4550
04:36:26,900 --> 04:36:28,080
Oh, wait, wait.

4551
04:36:28,540 --> 04:36:31,760
Oh, oh, wait, wait.

4552
04:36:32,320 --> 04:36:33,200
Oh, oh, wait.

4553
04:36:33,600 --> 04:36:34,300
Oh, no.

4554
04:36:37,100 --> 04:36:37,840
Oh, wait.

4555
04:36:43,420 --> 04:36:45,160
Okay, that's all I can do.

4556
04:36:48,840 --> 04:36:49,960
I can't...

4557
04:36:51,260 --> 04:36:51,820
Um...

4558
04:36:56,490 --> 04:36:57,790
I had it.

4559
04:36:57,890 --> 04:36:59,070
What do you mean I had it?

4560
04:37:02,680 --> 04:37:04,040
What do you mean I had it?

4561
04:37:31,150 --> 04:37:31,710
Uh...

4562
04:37:33,970 --> 04:37:34,530
Uh...

4563
04:37:34,530 --> 04:37:35,530
Uh...

4564
04:37:37,870 --> 04:37:38,730
Okay, hold on.

4565
04:37:39,010 --> 04:37:39,770
Oh, wait, hold on.

4566
04:37:43,810 --> 04:37:44,690
Can I reach it now?

4567
04:37:45,550 --> 04:37:45,810
No.

4568
04:37:48,350 --> 04:37:49,590
Can I reach it from here?

4569
04:37:50,490 --> 04:37:50,890
No.

4570
04:37:53,630 --> 04:37:54,230
Huh?

4571
04:37:57,350 --> 04:37:57,570
Huh?

4572
04:37:59,430 --> 04:37:59,930
Wait.

4573
04:38:02,970 --> 04:38:04,930
I need you to move, Sis-o!

4574
04:38:05,790 --> 04:38:07,390
You're in my way!

4575
04:38:08,190 --> 04:38:10,150
You're in my way, Sis-o!

4576
04:38:11,350 --> 04:38:12,570
You're in my way!

4577
04:38:20,110 --> 04:38:21,850
It's right there, come on.

4578
04:38:21,990 --> 04:38:22,630
Hey, hey, hey.

4579
04:38:22,790 --> 04:38:23,870
Don't be mean about it, okay?

4580
04:38:23,930 --> 04:38:29,130
Just because I get something not as quickly as you do
doesn't mean you have to be mean about it.

4581
04:38:48,920 --> 04:38:49,980
Oh my god.

4582
04:38:50,520 --> 04:38:52,100
I need you to raise it again.

4583
04:38:53,320 --> 04:38:54,300
Raise the roof!

4584
04:38:59,220 --> 04:39:00,020
There we go.

4585
04:39:00,240 --> 04:39:00,520
Maybe.

4586
04:39:02,100 --> 04:39:02,640
I guess.

4587
04:39:08,440 --> 04:39:11,060
That was quite a sight to see.

4588
04:39:12,560 --> 04:39:15,160
It looks like this park just got a new feature.

4589
04:39:17,840 --> 04:39:20,040
But neither one of them even glanced this way.

4590
04:39:21,280 --> 04:39:25,440
I guess that's not surprising, seeing as even a meteorite
didn't distract them.

4591
04:39:28,800 --> 04:39:31,280
Hey, it was a desperate situation.

4592
04:39:31,480 --> 04:39:32,360
Kill or be killed.

4593
04:39:34,780 --> 04:39:37,460
right after this by the meteorite.

4594
04:39:37,680 --> 04:39:42,720
Well, now that the park has a new feature, we can use it to
our own advantage in any...

4595
04:39:42,720 --> 04:39:45,140
Or can we use it to our own advantage in any way?

4596
04:39:46,480 --> 04:39:46,920
Okay.

4597
04:39:47,700 --> 04:39:48,920
Cleared the first...

4598
04:39:48,920 --> 04:39:49,220
Oh!

4599
04:39:50,100 --> 04:39:51,180
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

4600
04:39:53,340 --> 04:39:53,780
Oh!

4601
04:39:58,480 --> 04:39:58,920
Oh!

4602
04:39:58,920 --> 04:39:59,020
Oh!

4603
04:40:11,440 --> 04:40:13,100
What can you do?

4604
04:40:13,560 --> 04:40:14,520
Spray any higher?

4605
04:40:14,960 --> 04:40:16,080
You're literally stuck.

4606
04:40:17,120 --> 04:40:18,300
Okay, Cicil is stuck.

4607
04:40:19,920 --> 04:40:20,400
Stuckle.

4608
04:40:31,580 --> 04:40:33,500
Yeah, let's try the water just a tiny bit.

4609
04:40:35,240 --> 04:40:35,660
There's no use.

4610
04:40:35,800 --> 04:40:37,280
I can't get any water to come out.

4611
04:40:39,520 --> 04:40:40,860
Well, we can see why not.

4612
04:40:41,060 --> 04:40:44,140
Yeah, the overwhelming presence of Minto.

4613
04:40:45,820 --> 04:40:47,360
If only we could use it to our advantage somehow.

4614
04:40:48,600 --> 04:40:51,440
How can we use it to our...

4615
04:40:54,930 --> 04:40:55,510
Um...

4616
04:40:55,510 --> 04:40:59,390
Is there anything that I can...

4617
04:40:59,390 --> 04:41:00,780
Anything that I can...

4618
04:41:04,890 --> 04:41:05,470
Hmm.

4619
04:41:08,170 --> 04:41:10,330
What can I do with it?

4620
04:41:10,530 --> 04:41:12,230
With it?

4621
04:41:12,530 --> 04:41:13,230
Oh wait!

4622
04:41:14,650 --> 04:41:15,790
Post Lantern.

4623
04:41:30,730 --> 04:41:31,350
Um...

4624
04:41:33,750 --> 04:41:34,370
Um...

4625
04:41:35,230 --> 04:41:35,850
Um...

4626
04:41:46,280 --> 04:41:48,960
There's one more core there is.

4627
04:41:52,380 --> 04:41:52,920
Over here?

4628
04:41:53,200 --> 04:41:53,440
No.

4629
04:41:54,880 --> 04:41:55,980
I don't know.

4630
04:41:56,160 --> 04:41:57,240
I'm trying to figure it out.

4631
04:41:57,780 --> 04:41:58,880
I'm just going everywhere.

4632
04:41:59,020 --> 04:41:59,860
I'm just...

4633
04:42:00,740 --> 04:42:02,320
Use it to our advantage.

4634
04:42:03,560 --> 04:42:06,160
Use it to our advantage that no water is coming out.

4635
04:42:09,240 --> 04:42:10,180
Use it to our advantage.

4636
04:42:16,860 --> 04:42:19,060
I'm only glancing at chat sometimes.

4637
04:42:19,240 --> 04:42:22,240
Even if people are giving answers, I'm most likely not
seeing it.

4638
04:42:22,540 --> 04:42:25,200
So you guys can be like, stop backseating.

4639
04:42:25,760 --> 04:42:26,200
But it's okay.

4640
04:42:26,340 --> 04:42:27,360
I'm not watching.

4641
04:42:27,460 --> 04:42:28,460
I'm not looking at it either.

4642
04:42:30,540 --> 04:42:33,220
I'm not really seeing anyone telling me what to do either.

4643
04:42:34,580 --> 04:42:34,940
Oh,

4644
04:42:44,180 --> 04:42:44,580
here we go.

4645
04:42:53,730 --> 04:42:55,290
I guess we'll just play it out and see what happens.

4646
04:43:14,210 --> 04:43:16,650
I doubt we can move those two from that spot.

4647
04:43:17,750 --> 04:43:20,750
Which means we have to do something with the Temsic fragment
instead.

4648
04:43:22,110 --> 04:43:23,210
That should be easy with our power.

4649
04:43:23,590 --> 04:43:24,990
with the fragment, huh?

4650
04:43:27,890 --> 04:43:28,670
I think you're right, Missal.

4651
04:43:28,970 --> 04:43:31,630
This is going, this is going to be the grand finale.

4652
04:43:32,970 --> 04:43:33,210
Huh?

4653
04:43:37,070 --> 04:43:38,510
Do something with the fragment?

4654
04:43:42,890 --> 04:43:44,410
Do something with the fragment?

4655
04:43:47,750 --> 04:43:50,130
Oh my gosh, I forgot it was from all the way back here.

4656
04:43:54,900 --> 04:43:55,340
Rock!

4657
04:43:59,010 --> 04:43:59,230
Mew!

4658
04:43:59,330 --> 04:44:01,070
Oh my gosh, I can't see it.

4659
04:44:09,140 --> 04:44:10,780
Now, that's there.

4660
04:44:12,860 --> 04:44:15,040
And then spray higher.

4661
04:44:16,260 --> 04:44:16,640
Oh, wait.

4662
04:44:17,600 --> 04:44:18,180
Can I reach it?

4663
04:44:18,240 --> 04:44:18,400
Yeah.

4664
04:44:19,480 --> 04:44:20,300
Like that.

4665
04:44:22,740 --> 04:44:25,240
And then we go back about here.

4666
04:44:27,140 --> 04:44:28,700
Can I go down just a little bit?

4667
04:44:29,020 --> 04:44:30,040
Oh, right there.

4668
04:44:30,980 --> 04:44:39,360
so close wait can i reach it from here oh so close uh um
okay just a little bit higher

4669
04:44:44,560 --> 04:44:58,620
spray spray please wait oh wait oh no no wait oh i can't i
forgot that i need to do it from down here oh my gosh it's

4670
04:44:58,620 --> 04:45:00,660
the timing of it um

4671
04:45:06,600 --> 04:45:07,240
Maybe here?

4672
04:45:12,940 --> 04:45:13,900
Way overthinking.

4673
04:45:14,020 --> 04:45:15,120
What are you talking about?

4674
04:45:18,080 --> 04:45:18,560
Okay.

4675
04:45:19,500 --> 04:45:20,100
There we go.

4676
04:45:20,380 --> 04:45:21,200
Now I have to do it.

4677
04:45:22,240 --> 04:45:23,000
Now, now.

4678
04:45:23,220 --> 04:45:23,600
There we go.

4679
04:45:23,800 --> 04:45:24,380
Oh my goodness.

4680
04:45:26,220 --> 04:45:27,140
Spray, please.

4681
04:45:27,560 --> 04:45:28,320
There we go.

4682
04:45:29,240 --> 04:45:30,100
I'm good.

4683
04:45:31,600 --> 04:45:32,080
Swap.

4684
04:45:33,120 --> 04:45:33,460
Okay.

4685
04:45:34,520 --> 04:45:35,480
This is

4686
04:45:49,140 --> 04:45:50,240
what I wanted to do from the beginning.

4687
04:45:50,260 --> 04:45:52,280
The lamppost is bending.

4688
04:45:53,720 --> 04:45:54,720
But it hasn't broken yet.

4689
04:45:55,460 --> 04:45:56,220
It really is a wonder.

4690
04:45:56,460 --> 04:45:57,120
It hasn't snapped.

4691
04:45:58,240 --> 04:46:00,340
It just might hold out for a little while longer.

4692
04:46:01,060 --> 04:46:05,520
If I recall, the Temsik fragment smashed through the glass
lantern on its way down.

4693
04:46:07,520 --> 04:46:13,500
But if Mino sits firmly in its way, then fate should- Oh,
goodbye, Lin.

4694
04:46:16,000 --> 04:46:16,960
Goodbye, Lin.

4695
04:46:20,260 --> 04:46:21,660
Is there anything else I could do here?

4696
04:46:22,400 --> 04:46:24,260
I think, um...

4697
04:46:25,220 --> 04:46:26,440
I think this is it.

4698
04:46:36,540 --> 04:46:36,980
Oh!

4699
04:46:37,600 --> 04:46:37,960
There!

4700
04:46:38,060 --> 04:46:38,580
How's that?

4701
04:46:39,560 --> 04:46:40,840
Look, the fragment's course!

4702
04:46:41,020 --> 04:46:41,880
It changed a little!

4703
04:46:42,640 --> 04:46:44,680
Now, Yomiya's fate should really change.

4704
04:46:45,580 --> 04:46:46,080
Wait a minute.

4705
04:46:46,700 --> 04:46:48,480
Take another look at the fragment's trajectory.

4706
04:46:48,860 --> 04:46:49,180
Uh-oh.

4707
04:46:49,320 --> 04:46:51,120
Now that it's changed, what's in its path?

4708
04:46:52,000 --> 04:46:52,900
In its path?

4709
04:46:53,600 --> 04:46:54,040
No!

4710
04:46:55,060 --> 04:46:55,500
Only

4711
04:47:04,350 --> 04:47:05,370
got hit in the leg, though.

4712
04:47:06,910 --> 04:47:08,150
fragment shot through his leg!

4713
04:47:08,270 --> 04:47:08,550
It's okay!

4714
04:47:08,710 --> 04:47:09,470
It's only his leg!

4715
04:47:12,130 --> 04:47:14,170
But the cruel twist of fate weren't over yet.

4716
04:47:14,390 --> 04:47:15,370
Oh, what do you mean by that?

4717
04:47:17,850 --> 04:47:19,690
Um, come on, put it down.

4718
04:47:21,130 --> 04:47:22,710
Jowd, put the gun down now!

4719
04:47:23,050 --> 04:47:24,950
If you don't, you're going to shoot him!

4720
04:47:26,030 --> 04:47:29,010
I don't know if it's his detective training or what.

4721
04:47:29,590 --> 04:47:32,370
But even though he's shaking from the pain, the gun doesn't
waver.

4722
04:47:34,270 --> 04:47:35,750
Put the gun down!

4723
04:47:38,010 --> 04:47:38,490
No!

4724
04:47:38,950 --> 04:47:39,390
Oh my god.

4725
04:47:40,230 --> 04:47:40,730
I knew it.

4726
04:47:40,970 --> 04:47:42,110
This is my true fate.

4727
04:47:42,670 --> 04:47:45,610
In the end, I stole his life away with my own hands.

4728
04:47:46,210 --> 04:47:46,870
Or you missed.

4729
04:47:48,570 --> 04:47:48,710
Oh!

4730
04:47:50,390 --> 04:47:51,110
Let's go!

4731
04:47:51,210 --> 04:47:52,470
I won't let that happen!

4732
04:47:53,090 --> 04:47:53,550
Missile!

4733
04:47:53,750 --> 04:47:54,690
But the bullet stopped.

4734
04:47:54,870 --> 04:47:55,850
It stopped in mid-air!

4735
04:47:56,450 --> 04:47:57,670
I'm here inside the bullet!

4736
04:47:58,270 --> 04:47:59,490
Now let's swap it with something.

4737
04:48:00,650 --> 04:48:01,070
What?

4738
04:48:01,390 --> 04:48:01,850
With what?

4739
04:48:02,570 --> 04:48:03,230
Detective Jowd.

4740
04:48:03,710 --> 04:48:06,190
The meteorite fragment is what made you pull the trigger.

4741
04:48:06,910 --> 04:48:07,970
We won't let you become a meteor.

4742
04:48:17,430 --> 04:48:20,250
We won't let you become a...

4743
04:48:29,040 --> 04:48:32,080
We have to prove that murder isn't the detective's true
fate.

4744
04:48:32,640 --> 04:48:34,260
To do that, we have to stop this bullet.

4745
04:48:34,840 --> 04:48:37,440
There must be something with the same shape as the bullet
around here.

4746
04:48:41,190 --> 04:48:41,890
Eat that!

4747
04:48:42,090 --> 04:48:42,390
Oh!

4748
04:48:46,330 --> 04:48:47,930
Sorry, that was really loud.

4749
04:48:48,510 --> 04:48:49,070
Oh my god!

4750
04:48:51,310 --> 04:48:52,590
We stopped the bullet.

4751
04:48:53,690 --> 04:48:55,170
Oh, he still couldn't save him.

4752
04:48:56,010 --> 04:48:56,970
That's not true.

4753
04:48:59,110 --> 04:49:01,850
My fate of getting pierced through the back might not have
changed.

4754
04:49:02,990 --> 04:49:04,190
But I'm still alive.

4755
04:49:05,170 --> 04:49:05,390
What?

4756
04:49:06,250 --> 04:49:07,170
I'm not dead.

4757
04:49:07,310 --> 04:49:08,030
I'm just unconscious.

4758
04:49:08,590 --> 04:49:09,990
I mean, for now?

4759
04:49:11,170 --> 04:49:12,990
Okay, so your fate of death has changed.

4760
04:49:13,210 --> 04:49:17,050
But still, this fate is just too painful to watch in every
sense.

4761
04:49:17,570 --> 04:49:18,750
I don't think so.

4762
04:49:21,310 --> 04:49:23,150
As long as I'm alive, that's good enough for me.

4763
04:49:25,070 --> 04:49:26,710
But we were overlooking one thing.

4764
04:49:27,670 --> 04:49:29,530
The wheel of fate was still slowly turning.

4765
04:49:33,350 --> 04:49:33,510
No!

4766
04:49:38,600 --> 04:49:39,200
Wake up!

4767
04:49:39,500 --> 04:49:40,660
You gotta get out of there!

4768
04:49:41,640 --> 04:49:42,060
Oh my god.

4769
04:49:42,540 --> 04:49:43,020
Oh my god!

4770
04:49:44,480 --> 04:49:45,820
Damn it, my leg won't work!

4771
04:49:47,480 --> 04:49:48,460
It's all over!

4772
04:49:49,120 --> 04:49:50,700
We're out of time!

4773
04:49:51,400 --> 04:49:52,320
Miss Lynn!

4774
04:49:55,240 --> 04:49:56,560
It's not over yet!

4775
04:49:57,480 --> 04:49:59,460
But there isn't anything else to swap with!

4776
04:50:01,500 --> 04:50:04,380
Why don't we just let it play out and then try to find
another way next time?

4777
04:50:04,820 --> 04:50:07,600
Even if she dies, all you have to do is possess her corpse.

4778
04:50:08,100 --> 04:50:10,820
And then you can redo her last four minutes as many times as
it takes!

4779
04:50:11,420 --> 04:50:12,740
Wait, that's what I...

4780
04:50:14,180 --> 04:50:15,500
No, I won't do that!

4781
04:50:16,380 --> 04:50:17,040
Why not?

4782
04:50:17,580 --> 04:50:22,360
Sure, the fact of her death would be erased, but her memory
of it would remain like a scar on her psyche.

4783
04:50:24,700 --> 04:50:26,580
I won't let that happen, not if I can help it.

4784
04:50:27,400 --> 04:50:28,660
What can we do now?

4785
04:50:28,980 --> 04:50:30,060
Even if we work together!

4786
04:50:34,620 --> 04:50:36,920
I think there might be something that can be done.

4787
04:50:38,300 --> 04:50:38,900
What is it?

4788
04:50:39,460 --> 04:50:40,760
What can Sissel and I do?

4789
04:50:41,840 --> 04:50:42,960
Don't forget I'm here too.

4790
04:50:43,200 --> 04:50:44,700
We finally, finally!

4791
04:50:47,740 --> 04:50:48,540
Oh wow.

4792
04:50:48,820 --> 04:50:52,500
You know, you could have helped out, you know, at any point
in the future, like in the past.

4793
04:50:56,320 --> 04:51:06,080
With three kinds of powers among us among us we ought to be
able to fight this battle this battle against the fate of

4794
04:51:06,080 --> 04:51:20,060
death yo mia sisal your power is manipulating objects use
your power to manipulate this huh I don't get it just trust

4795
04:51:20,060 --> 04:51:30,200
me just go all right I'll try to move there now gather your
strength and make it spray as if your life depended on it.

4796
04:51:31,340 --> 04:51:32,460
I'm dead though.

4797
04:51:33,340 --> 04:51:34,800
He's just like me for real, for real.

4798
04:51:35,960 --> 04:51:39,800
In that case, make it spray as if you're death depended on
it.

4799
04:51:40,100 --> 04:51:41,020
Give it your all.

4800
04:51:41,500 --> 04:51:43,840
And remember, you only have a split second.

4801
04:51:45,320 --> 04:51:46,460
Okay, now do it!

4802
04:51:46,960 --> 04:51:47,600
Got it!

4803
04:51:50,000 --> 04:51:51,840
Okay, okay, okay.

4804
04:51:52,680 --> 04:51:53,200
Oh!

4805
04:51:53,700 --> 04:51:55,020
Now it's your turn, Missile!

4806
04:51:55,900 --> 04:51:56,140
What?

4807
04:51:56,600 --> 04:51:57,000
Uh, me?

4808
04:51:57,020 --> 04:51:57,800
But what can I do?

4809
04:51:58,700 --> 04:52:00,180
I think you know an answer to that.

4810
04:52:01,680 --> 04:52:02,720
Okay, got it.

4811
04:52:03,820 --> 04:52:04,660
You could swap them.

4812
04:52:05,160 --> 04:52:07,780
That hunk of concrete will go back to its original position.

4813
04:52:08,620 --> 04:52:10,960
Wait, but it's still going to be flying through the air.

4814
04:52:13,420 --> 04:52:15,060
Wait, I don't think you thought this through.

4815
04:52:16,760 --> 04:52:19,660
But even if I swap them, it's still going to be right above
Miss Lynn.

4816
04:52:19,820 --> 04:52:20,040
Yeah.

4817
04:52:20,940 --> 04:52:21,640
Don't worry.

4818
04:52:22,860 --> 04:52:23,620
Okay, I'll do it.

4819
04:52:23,640 --> 04:52:24,300
I'll swap them.

4820
04:52:29,220 --> 04:52:29,580
Okay.

4821
04:52:32,420 --> 04:52:35,220
It's no use, we can't stop that horrible Meno!

4822
04:52:36,940 --> 04:52:37,660
What can we do now?

4823
04:52:38,160 --> 04:52:40,740
I don't see how gaining a second or two helped.

4824
04:52:41,580 --> 04:52:42,460
Oh, it helped, alright.

4825
04:52:42,920 --> 04:52:45,040
Those few seconds were exactly what I wanted.

4826
04:52:47,360 --> 04:52:48,420
Last up, it's my turn.

4827
04:52:49,660 --> 04:52:50,280
Your turn.

4828
04:52:53,380 --> 04:52:53,740
Him.

4829
04:52:55,380 --> 04:52:57,160
You know what my power is, right?

4830
04:52:57,520 --> 04:52:59,340
I can manipulate living creatures.

4831
04:52:59,740 --> 04:53:01,940
Wait a minute, you mean...

4832
04:53:01,940 --> 04:53:02,560
That's right.

4833
04:53:03,060 --> 04:53:04,520
I'm going to save that little girl.

4834
04:53:05,080 --> 04:53:07,740
Save her by manipulating my own unconscious body.

4835
04:53:10,040 --> 04:53:10,660
Oh!

4836
04:53:35,140 --> 04:53:36,380
He got...

4837
04:53:36,380 --> 04:53:38,340
Penny redeemed himself.

4838
04:53:38,620 --> 04:53:39,420
Oh my god.

4839
04:53:41,380 --> 04:53:42,160
You're awake.

4840
04:53:50,590 --> 04:53:51,810
Mr. Is your knee okay?

4841
04:53:54,430 --> 04:53:56,810
Oh, it'll be fine.

4842
04:53:59,310 --> 04:54:04,630
I'm lucky it wasn't a fatal hit, but the main thing is that
you're not hurt.

4843
04:54:07,030 --> 04:54:07,970
You saved me, mister.

4844
04:54:09,470 --> 04:54:10,710
I was just doing my job.

4845
04:54:12,330 --> 04:54:14,390
The gods, they're the ones who saved you.

4846
04:54:15,790 --> 04:54:16,750
What's your job, mister?

4847
04:54:17,730 --> 04:54:19,170
I'm a police detective.

4848
04:54:24,050 --> 04:54:25,870
Do you think you could go call the police for me?

4849
04:54:26,750 --> 04:54:28,790
I think you could do it quicker than I could.

4850
04:54:30,550 --> 04:54:30,810
What?

4851
04:54:35,500 --> 04:54:36,260
What's that?

4852
04:54:37,320 --> 04:54:38,580
This is a detective's badge.

4853
04:54:38,740 --> 04:54:40,780
We give them to children who've been very brave.

4854
04:54:42,100 --> 04:54:43,140
A detective's badge?

4855
04:54:43,360 --> 04:54:43,660
Aww.

4856
04:54:45,940 --> 04:54:47,800
No, so cute.

4857
04:54:49,920 --> 04:54:50,500
Thanks.

4858
04:54:51,920 --> 04:54:53,300
You know what to do, little detective.

4859
04:55:06,380 --> 04:55:07,340
Are you alive?

4860
04:55:08,940 --> 04:55:10,360
Yeah, sadly.

4861
04:55:11,060 --> 04:55:12,400
He's still alive.

4862
04:55:12,720 --> 04:55:13,900
I thought it was a lollipop too.

4863
04:55:14,620 --> 04:55:16,100
Hang on, help is coming.

4864
04:55:16,760 --> 04:55:19,120
What made you do such a reckless thing?

4865
04:55:22,260 --> 04:55:24,000
To be perfectly honest, I don't really know.

4866
04:55:24,340 --> 04:55:25,380
They all don't remember.

4867
04:55:25,760 --> 04:55:27,860
We basically went back in time entirely.

4868
04:55:29,720 --> 04:55:32,280
When I came to, my body was already moving by itself.

4869
04:55:33,160 --> 04:55:35,900
It was as if somebody else was controlling me.

4870
04:55:37,280 --> 04:55:37,740
I see.

4871
04:55:38,980 --> 04:55:41,460
But you know, I'm glad it happened.

4872
04:56:07,440 --> 04:56:08,520
I found this kitten.

4873
04:56:08,540 --> 04:56:09,460
It was over there.

4874
04:56:10,480 --> 04:56:12,000
No, no, no, no.

4875
04:56:28,740 --> 04:56:29,700
Come to think of it.

4876
04:56:30,060 --> 04:56:31,280
I just saw it a few minutes ago.

4877
04:56:31,780 --> 04:56:32,900
It's probably astray.

4878
04:56:33,200 --> 04:56:33,960
It's alive, right?

4879
04:56:34,520 --> 04:56:35,620
It's kind of limp.

4880
04:56:36,480 --> 04:56:37,080
Is it okay?

4881
04:56:40,860 --> 04:56:41,680
I don't know.

4882
04:56:41,800 --> 04:56:42,500
I think it's unconscious.

4883
04:56:42,700 --> 04:56:43,460
Okay, it's unconscious.

4884
04:56:43,780 --> 04:56:44,060
It's unconscious.

4885
04:56:45,220 --> 04:56:45,560
It's funny.

4886
04:56:45,680 --> 04:56:47,280
It doesn't look like it's injured or anything.

4887
04:56:48,460 --> 04:56:51,440
I thought the...

4888
04:56:52,040 --> 04:56:53,020
Poor little kitty.

4889
04:56:54,980 --> 04:56:55,440
Mm-hmm.

4890
04:56:55,580 --> 04:56:58,340
How about if I take it to my house and look after it?

4891
04:56:59,280 --> 04:57:01,100
Would you like to come home with me, a little kitten?

4892
04:57:09,940 --> 04:57:13,880
Well, it looks like his fate just changed in a big way.

4893
04:57:15,160 --> 04:57:15,560
Whose fate?

4894
04:57:16,480 --> 04:57:17,600
That kittens, of course.

4895
04:57:18,540 --> 04:57:19,500
You're absurd.

4896
04:57:20,480 --> 04:57:21,640
Why did you have to?

4897
04:57:25,480 --> 04:57:26,500
In the middle.

4898
04:57:27,060 --> 04:57:27,460
Hey!

4899
04:57:30,720 --> 04:57:31,360
Cicels!

4900
04:57:33,680 --> 04:57:34,320
Cicel?

4901
04:57:35,700 --> 04:57:37,640
The name Cicel echoes in my head.

4902
04:57:38,680 --> 04:57:39,660
That's my real name.

4903
04:57:41,280 --> 04:57:42,520
So we weren't a rat!

4904
04:57:43,420 --> 04:57:44,720
We were a cat!

4905
04:57:45,500 --> 04:57:47,520
These long, lonely ten years.

4906
04:57:48,180 --> 04:57:50,120
You were my one and only friend.

4907
04:57:55,040 --> 04:57:55,940
No, me?

4908
04:57:56,740 --> 04:57:57,700
How about it?

4909
04:57:58,000 --> 04:57:59,080
Do you remember now?

4910
04:58:00,360 --> 04:58:00,820
Whoa!

4911
04:58:02,180 --> 04:58:03,460
Oh, so cute.

4912
04:58:05,120 --> 04:58:06,180
Old friend.

4913
04:58:06,740 --> 04:58:06,760
Oh.

4914
04:58:11,850 --> 04:58:13,350
Oh my God, we're awesome.

4915
04:58:15,010 --> 04:58:18,510
I think, I think I finally remember.

4916
04:58:20,730 --> 04:58:23,370
10 years ago, I was a little kitten that wandered into this
park.

4917
04:58:23,890 --> 04:58:25,790
I was weak and all alone in the world.

4918
04:58:28,630 --> 04:58:29,570
Hold it.

4919
04:58:35,580 --> 04:58:38,380
God, why am I crying?

4920
04:58:43,040 --> 04:58:45,180
Somebody, please look at me.

4921
04:58:46,780 --> 04:58:46,800
No.

4922
04:58:48,380 --> 04:58:52,590
The kitten.

4923
04:58:56,460 --> 04:58:58,300
That's why I didn't know anything.

4924
04:59:02,500 --> 04:59:03,080
No.

4925
04:59:03,900 --> 04:59:04,720
So cute.

4926
04:59:09,130 --> 04:59:11,270
Somebody please reach a hand out to me.

4927
04:59:14,830 --> 04:59:17,630
Oh, and he can manipulate.

4928
04:59:18,430 --> 04:59:20,270
I had just only died at the time.

4929
04:59:22,070 --> 04:59:22,910
I had lost everything.

4930
04:59:23,010 --> 04:59:29,330
My life, my memory, my body wouldn't move anymore, but I
still managed to reach a hand out of hand to him.

4931
04:59:35,380 --> 04:59:39,080
The next thing I knew, my soul, I transferred to the black
kitten.

4932
04:59:40,740 --> 04:59:42,680
with no recollection of who I was.

4933
04:59:43,120 --> 04:59:44,840
I lived as a cat with you for a while.

4934
04:59:52,770 --> 04:59:55,070
After a while, the man regained his memory.

4935
04:59:55,570 --> 04:59:57,030
I went back to being just a cat.

4936
04:59:57,870 --> 04:59:59,370
And then the man got his body back.

4937
05:00:07,910 --> 05:00:09,350
Gosh, I wish I were a cat.

4938
05:00:10,190 --> 05:00:12,070
I took my body back from the morgue.

4939
05:00:12,810 --> 05:00:15,530
There was somebody I just had to go see.

4940
05:00:17,170 --> 05:00:18,410
Just one more time.

4941
05:00:18,410 --> 05:00:25,570
I took control of my body and hurried to her house

4942
05:00:29,050 --> 05:00:30,950
But I was just a little too late

4943
05:00:34,950 --> 05:00:35,990
His wife

4944
05:00:46,120 --> 05:00:55,420
I just missed her as she left this world She left me a note
that said I'm coming to you, Yom Yom Yow

4945
05:01:05,440 --> 05:01:18,780
The man named me Sissel It was the name of something
important had lost along with his life his fiance he told me

4946
05:01:18,780 --> 05:01:23,560
about it once but I didn't understand what it was

4947
05:01:32,420 --> 05:01:40,840
those 10 years were very happy for me but they weren't happy
for the man there was nothing I could do for him

4948
05:01:49,220 --> 05:01:53,380
for 10 years I wandered through the darkness with no
particular place to go

4949
05:01:56,620 --> 05:01:59,860
As time passed, my powers gradually changed.

4950
05:02:00,800 --> 05:02:03,240
At first, I could only manipulate small creatures and
objects.

4951
05:02:03,980 --> 05:02:05,960
But then after a while, I could manipulate people.

4952
05:02:08,080 --> 05:02:12,160
That's when the darkness inside me deepened and I started to
get a little twisted.

4953
05:02:16,660 --> 05:02:18,060
I wanted light.

4954
05:02:19,140 --> 05:02:21,200
Distorted artificial light.

4955
05:02:37,730 --> 05:02:38,710
revenge on Lin.

4956
05:02:40,070 --> 05:02:40,990
I would see that light.

4957
05:02:41,390 --> 05:02:42,730
Or at least that's what I tried to believe.

4958
05:03:00,610 --> 05:03:03,910
I left my old self buried in that junkyard and walked away.

4959
05:03:15,530 --> 05:03:17,530
Wait, did we see this?

4960
05:03:18,170 --> 05:03:18,470
Before?

4961
05:03:18,630 --> 05:03:19,150
I don't remember.

4962
05:03:21,270 --> 05:03:22,510
The black cat.

4963
05:03:23,190 --> 05:03:24,730
I was possessing Cicel then.

4964
05:03:28,010 --> 05:03:32,550
It wouldn't look very much like a murder if the corpse got
up and walked away after all.

4965
05:03:33,130 --> 05:03:34,430
Yeah, we did way back, right?

4966
05:03:34,590 --> 05:03:34,850
Yeah.

4967
05:03:35,350 --> 05:03:37,630
So you borrowed the body of your old friend.

4968
05:03:38,610 --> 05:03:38,930
Aww.

4969
05:03:42,330 --> 05:03:45,030
Cicel was inside that bag I was carrying tonight.

4970
05:03:45,610 --> 05:03:46,930
Why would you bring your cat?

4971
05:03:47,910 --> 05:03:51,610
I had no intention of leaving my friend behind in this
country when I left.

4972
05:03:52,350 --> 05:03:55,010
But then, when I went to possess his body.

4973
05:03:55,830 --> 05:03:57,190
I realized something horrible.

4974
05:03:58,350 --> 05:03:59,150
What was that?

4975
05:03:59,930 --> 05:04:01,970
Cicel there inside the back, man.

4976
05:04:24,180 --> 05:04:27,260
Oh man, why are you having to kill him again?

4977
05:04:31,150 --> 05:04:32,270
Not the cat.

4978
05:04:35,590 --> 05:04:38,010
I wasn't able to control her completely.

4979
05:04:40,090 --> 05:04:40,450
No.

4980
05:04:42,510 --> 05:04:44,670
The first bullet didn't hit anything.

4981
05:04:45,290 --> 05:04:46,290
Or so, I thought.

4982
05:04:47,210 --> 05:04:49,370
But it did hit something.

4983
05:04:51,530 --> 05:04:53,950
It hits it so much.

4984
05:04:57,610 --> 05:04:58,890
That's so sad.

4985
05:05:01,990 --> 05:05:03,950
That's when I lost my life.

4986
05:05:04,470 --> 05:05:06,950
Right there in the presence of Temsic radiation.

4987
05:05:12,300 --> 05:05:15,560
And that's when I got my powers of the dead, my ghost
tricks.

4988
05:05:19,390 --> 05:05:21,250
I think I understand it now.

4989
05:05:23,530 --> 05:05:26,330
Why, I was the only one who couldn't get his memory back.

4990
05:05:29,090 --> 05:05:30,910
It was because I thought that corpse was me.

4991
05:05:31,030 --> 05:05:32,830
Yeah, because he took off with the body.

4992
05:05:35,310 --> 05:05:38,350
It was the only corpse I could see at the time, after all.

4993
05:05:40,630 --> 05:05:42,990
But as it turns out, it wasn't the only dead body.

4994
05:05:46,780 --> 05:05:49,480
My true death was hiding just behind that corpse.

4995
05:05:55,740 --> 05:05:58,740
Now I think about it, do you remember what you said?

4996
05:06:00,100 --> 05:06:02,600
That you knew all along about me saving Lin tonight?

4997
05:06:03,380 --> 05:06:05,300
If you knew, why didn't you try to stop me?

4998
05:06:06,820 --> 05:06:07,520
It's simple.

4999
05:06:08,660 --> 05:06:10,700
Because I couldn't, even if I wanted to.

5000
05:06:13,060 --> 05:06:13,680
Why not?

5001
05:06:15,600 --> 05:06:19,120
Remember the thing about individual differences and the
powers we get?

5002
05:06:20,140 --> 05:06:23,260
I can control all kinds of things, from the living to the
dead.

5003
05:06:23,620 --> 05:06:28,460
But even so, there are some things that you can do that I
can't.

5004
05:06:29,820 --> 05:06:35,120
You mean, I can't even rewind time, let alone change the
fate of a death.

5005
05:06:36,160 --> 05:06:41,580
If I could do those things, I would have saved your life.

5006
05:06:49,820 --> 05:06:56,000
Not only that, but I never would have just let my fiancé
stay dead like that.

5007
05:06:58,000 --> 05:07:00,600
But you're here 10 years in the past now!

5008
05:07:02,300 --> 05:07:03,620
That's thanks to your powers.

5009
05:07:05,500 --> 05:07:06,820
I just tagged along with you.

5010
05:07:18,060 --> 05:07:18,720
In any case.

5011
05:07:19,440 --> 05:07:23,240
Now the starting point of this entire tragedy has changed
dramatically, altering fate.

5012
05:07:30,600 --> 05:07:31,640
The fate of your death.

5013
05:07:32,280 --> 05:07:33,500
The kitten sisal's fate.

5014
05:07:35,060 --> 05:07:38,360
And I can just bet you the fate of the woman you love.

5015
05:07:38,380 --> 05:07:39,340
has changed too.

5016
05:07:43,000 --> 05:07:44,540
I believe you're right.

5017
05:07:47,520 --> 05:07:49,420
So this was the last fate to be averted, eh?

5018
05:07:51,060 --> 05:07:53,940
Why do you have to still play the animation?

5019
05:07:59,720 --> 05:08:00,920
So, yo-me-o.

5020
05:08:02,640 --> 05:08:05,200
It looks like your plan for revenge ended in failure.

5021
05:08:10,350 --> 05:08:11,730
Yes, and I'm Glad to.

5022
05:08:18,980 --> 05:08:20,680
I think I kind of understand now.

5023
05:08:22,180 --> 05:08:23,980
What you've been feeling these ten years.

5024
05:08:25,020 --> 05:08:25,500
Oh, yeah.

5025
05:08:27,580 --> 05:08:28,340
Shanda stood.

5026
05:08:28,820 --> 05:08:30,060
She shed tears for me.

5027
05:08:32,040 --> 05:08:33,460
That's when my revenge was over.

5028
05:08:34,800 --> 05:08:36,480
She saved me from the darkness.

5029
05:08:43,430 --> 05:08:45,050
Well, I guess it's time we got back.

5030
05:08:45,870 --> 05:08:47,710
A new ten years later was just born.

5031
05:08:47,890 --> 05:08:50,170
Oh, what's gonna be different?

5032
05:08:53,010 --> 05:08:55,830
Right, we should get back to our new present.

5033
05:08:56,610 --> 05:09:00,130
Oh, Missou!

5034
05:09:01,330 --> 05:09:04,150
I can't wait to see Miss Lin and Miss Camilla again!

5035
05:09:06,350 --> 05:09:08,710
So these past ten years will all vanish.

5036
05:09:09,250 --> 05:09:09,950
Will they remember?

5037
05:09:10,890 --> 05:09:11,750
Well, not completely.

5038
05:09:13,970 --> 05:09:16,750
The memories of all of us here will remain.

5039
05:09:17,150 --> 05:09:17,150
Oh!

5040
05:09:17,990 --> 05:09:20,550
Wait, what about Camilla and Lin too then?

5041
05:09:20,830 --> 05:09:22,070
I love seeing this game.

5042
05:09:22,190 --> 05:09:25,150
It's my favorite game after I'm just three or four.

5043
05:09:27,470 --> 05:09:29,090
Including the memory of what I did.

5044
05:09:29,450 --> 05:09:30,170
My crime.

5045
05:09:32,570 --> 05:09:34,630
That's the way this game of the dead works, eh?

5046
05:09:35,650 --> 05:09:37,330
And no matter what the reason.

5047
05:09:38,950 --> 05:09:43,070
There's no denying the fact that I took Lynn hostage and
tried to point a gun at her.

5048
05:09:44,930 --> 05:09:47,130
I have no intention of running away from that either.

5049
05:09:48,130 --> 05:09:50,630
The most inexcusable crime in my new life.

5050
05:09:52,430 --> 05:09:53,790
Congrats on beating the game in.

5051
05:09:54,050 --> 05:09:54,650
Thank you!

5052
05:09:56,810 --> 05:09:57,490
Hey, Cicel.

5053
05:10:00,010 --> 05:10:02,450
When we go back, our faiths will no longer be
interconnected.

5054
05:10:03,670 --> 05:10:04,850
It will be like we never met.

5055
05:10:05,610 --> 05:10:08,150
So before that happens, I just wanted to say one thing.

5056
05:10:09,710 --> 05:10:12,330
Tonight, I stole away your life with my own hands.

5057
05:10:13,510 --> 05:10:14,610
I'm truly sorry.

5058
05:10:17,550 --> 05:10:19,710
It's already a thing of the lost past.

5059
05:10:20,830 --> 05:10:21,990
have changed now.

5060
05:10:22,450 --> 05:10:22,970
Right, Yomiyo?

5061
05:10:27,620 --> 05:10:28,440
Thank you, Sissel.

5062
05:10:30,000 --> 05:10:31,860
I'm so very glad I met you.

5063
05:10:33,040 --> 05:10:34,020
Me too, Yomiyo.

5064
05:10:35,360 --> 05:10:37,880
Sissel, are we ever going to see each other again?

5065
05:10:38,700 --> 05:10:40,300
I couldn't stand it if we weren't.

5066
05:10:41,340 --> 05:10:42,120
Don't worry, Misssel.

5067
05:10:43,360 --> 05:10:44,900
I bet we'll see each other again someday.

5068
05:10:47,260 --> 05:10:49,580
Ten years from now, our paths are sure to cross.

5069
05:10:50,400 --> 05:10:51,980
We'll just have to wait until then.

5070
05:10:53,160 --> 05:10:55,520
so I'll never forget you.

5071
05:10:56,800 --> 05:10:59,440
I'll never forget you either, Valia, little doggy.

5072
05:11:02,940 --> 05:11:05,000
Well, it looks like you've come to live with me now.

5073
05:11:05,860 --> 05:11:07,960
So let's be getting home, little black cat.

5074
05:11:09,200 --> 05:11:09,900
Home, huh?

5075
05:11:10,240 --> 05:11:11,860
That sounds good, Detective Jowd.

5076
05:11:14,480 --> 05:11:16,620
We all witnessed the birth of a new beginning.

5077
05:11:16,920 --> 05:11:19,820
And now, we're each going back to our own new present.

5078
05:11:20,060 --> 05:11:21,360
This is all so weird.

5079
05:11:24,460 --> 05:11:28,000
We said goodbye to the parts of our stories that would be
lost.

5080
05:11:28,580 --> 05:11:31,140
Believing that someday our paths would all cross again.

5081
05:11:33,960 --> 05:11:39,180
Well, I mean, if you have your memories still, you can all
just meet up again, right?

5082
05:11:39,660 --> 05:11:40,000
Wait!

5083
05:11:40,580 --> 05:11:41,140
Hold it!

5084
05:11:43,240 --> 05:11:44,460
Oh, oh, oh.

5085
05:11:46,760 --> 05:11:49,780
Before you go back to a new present, I wanted to thank you.

5086
05:11:50,420 --> 05:11:51,080
Is this Ray?

5087
05:11:51,560 --> 05:11:52,300
Is this the lamp?

5088
05:11:56,280 --> 05:11:58,400
Before I cease to exist.

5089
05:11:59,380 --> 05:12:00,060
Oh, it's you.

5090
05:12:01,180 --> 05:12:04,560
Yes, it is I, Ray, in case you have forgotten again.

5091
05:12:05,320 --> 05:12:05,720
Yedi!

5092
05:12:07,260 --> 05:12:07,980
Thanks to you.

5093
05:12:08,320 --> 05:12:10,100
Everything has turned out as I had hoped.

5094
05:12:11,260 --> 05:12:12,920
I'm really grateful to you, Sissel.

5095
05:12:13,260 --> 05:12:13,820
Thank you.

5096
05:12:15,160 --> 05:12:19,160
But don't forget, I was only on a journey to find my own
lost memory.

5097
05:12:20,060 --> 05:12:21,260
Yes, yes, I know that.

5098
05:12:22,700 --> 05:12:23,140
Okay.

5099
05:12:23,160 --> 05:12:24,380
I know all about you.

5100
05:12:25,360 --> 05:12:26,600
Can I ask you a question, Ray?

5101
05:12:27,480 --> 05:12:28,280
I want to know.

5102
05:12:28,920 --> 05:12:30,080
Who exactly are you?

5103
05:12:33,990 --> 05:12:34,830
Fair enough.

5104
05:12:35,430 --> 05:12:36,170
I will tell you.

5105
05:12:37,310 --> 05:12:40,570
Let me tell you about another version of tonight's events.

5106
05:12:41,890 --> 05:12:42,110
Huh?

5107
05:12:42,890 --> 05:12:43,450
Huh?

5108
05:12:44,250 --> 05:12:44,510
Huh?

5109
05:12:45,430 --> 05:12:48,210
You changed the fates of many people tonight.

5110
05:12:50,710 --> 05:12:52,030
The first of which was hers.

5111
05:12:54,730 --> 05:12:55,270
Lynn?

5112
05:12:59,190 --> 05:13:01,670
We killed people in the process, too.

5113
05:13:02,850 --> 05:13:04,090
We killed other people.

5114
05:13:06,670 --> 05:13:13,310
If you had not been there for her tonight, her fate would
have been to die in that lonely spot on the outskirts of

5115
05:13:13,310 --> 05:13:13,750
town.

5116
05:13:14,630 --> 05:13:16,370
The return of best character of the game.

5117
05:13:17,390 --> 05:13:18,150
I thought it occurred.

5118
05:13:18,510 --> 05:13:19,750
What do you suppose would have happened?

5119
05:13:20,770 --> 05:13:21,750
I don't know.

5120
05:13:23,330 --> 05:13:25,410
Let me tell you a story.

5121
05:13:26,130 --> 05:13:27,430
The story of a little creature.

5122
05:13:32,320 --> 05:13:32,520
What?

5123
05:13:33,140 --> 05:13:37,340
After they stole her life that night, they broke into her
apartment.

5124
05:13:40,040 --> 05:13:40,880
Oh, Missa!

5125
05:13:41,780 --> 05:13:43,040
Don't hurt Missa.

5126
05:13:43,680 --> 05:13:44,400
Don't do it.

5127
05:13:45,160 --> 05:13:45,540
Oh!

5128
05:13:47,280 --> 05:13:48,340
Don't do it!

5129
05:13:48,620 --> 05:13:49,700
It's not necessary!

5130
05:13:53,190 --> 05:13:56,530
They stole the wooden box from the ceiling, hiding place,
and left.

5131
05:13:56,590 --> 05:13:57,970
How did they know it was up there?

5132
05:13:58,510 --> 05:13:59,590
And in the process...

5133
05:14:02,590 --> 05:14:04,690
They killed them both?

5134
05:14:07,290 --> 05:14:09,750
Two little dead bodies were left behind.

5135
05:14:10,010 --> 05:14:10,350
What?

5136
05:14:16,560 --> 05:14:19,880
However, the little fellow's spirit lived on.

5137
05:14:20,720 --> 05:14:23,560
He desperately reached out his paw towards his mistress.

5138
05:14:24,400 --> 05:14:25,980
And that's when a miracle occurred.

5139
05:14:28,000 --> 05:14:28,680
What?

5140
05:14:29,300 --> 05:14:37,880
that the powers of the dead but how she didn't really
understand it himself not yet anyway but with all you know

5141
05:14:37,880 --> 05:14:51,190
now i bet you understand it do you not hey wait a minute
look at the toe as he shoots him oh my god why is it oh oh

5142
05:14:51,190 --> 05:15:00,430
my god because he was close to sis i mean that yeah sis wait
that's oh my god my brain yum yeah he died inside the aura

5143
05:15:00,430 --> 05:15:01,970
of that strange energy.

5144
05:15:05,410 --> 05:15:09,330
But unfortunately with his meager powers, he was unable to
save his little mistress.

5145
05:15:09,710 --> 05:15:13,690
Oh, there just wasn't anything he could do with only the
power to swap objects.

5146
05:15:14,510 --> 05:15:17,650
He needed the power to manipulate objects in order to save
the little lady.

5147
05:15:19,210 --> 05:15:21,130
The little fellow chased after the men.

5148
05:15:21,770 --> 05:15:23,490
There still wasn't anything he could do.

5149
05:15:28,330 --> 05:15:31,570
In the end, he was left behind with the man in red in the
deep, deep sea.

5150
05:15:31,750 --> 05:15:32,910
Oh my God, no!

5151
05:15:35,170 --> 05:15:39,190
And then, okay, he went back.

5152
05:15:39,950 --> 05:15:43,930
He went back to the world the 10 years before to the moment
of the man in Red's death.

5153
05:15:50,500 --> 05:15:51,060
Huh?

5154
05:15:52,480 --> 05:15:53,040
What?

5155
05:15:55,240 --> 05:15:55,800
Huh?

5156
05:15:56,880 --> 05:15:57,380
Huh?

5157
05:15:58,460 --> 05:15:58,880
Huh?

5158
05:15:59,760 --> 05:16:01,520
He decided to wait it out.

5159
05:16:02,460 --> 05:16:04,780
He decided to wait until that night came again.

5160
05:16:10,980 --> 05:16:13,680
That's the other version of the story of this night.

5161
05:16:16,720 --> 05:16:17,580
Is this missile?

5162
05:16:20,300 --> 05:16:22,480
He's been waiting this whole time?

5163
05:16:28,820 --> 05:16:29,960
Oh my god, Ihajiko!

5164
05:16:31,940 --> 05:16:36,300
A story that has taken these 10 years to be retold.

5165
05:16:39,740 --> 05:16:41,140
So that was you.

5166
05:16:50,920 --> 05:16:52,200
Old soul!

5167
05:16:54,360 --> 05:16:55,420
That's right.

5168
05:16:56,080 --> 05:16:57,040
I miss...

5169
05:16:57,040 --> 05:16:58,940
Hold on, he needs like a really...

5170
05:16:58,940 --> 05:16:59,860
What?

5171
05:17:01,380 --> 05:17:02,540
No way!

5172
05:17:04,560 --> 05:17:06,160
I miss all.

5173
05:17:06,780 --> 05:17:10,240
Ten years is a very long time in dark years.

5174
05:17:11,340 --> 05:17:14,220
You couldn't change the fates of these people on your own.

5175
05:17:14,360 --> 05:17:16,120
Wait, but how did he go back in time?

5176
05:17:17,900 --> 05:17:20,060
That's why he had the grandpa voice.

5177
05:17:20,260 --> 05:17:21,600
Oh my god, you're right.

5178
05:17:22,820 --> 05:17:26,280
Oh my god, you're right.

5179
05:17:29,820 --> 05:17:32,280
So you decided to wait those 10 years out.

5180
05:17:34,040 --> 05:17:34,820
Best character.

5181
05:17:35,860 --> 05:17:36,380
Meso.

5182
05:17:37,560 --> 05:17:38,140
Exactly.

5183
05:17:39,580 --> 05:17:43,560
And then at last, that fateful night rolled around again.

5184
05:17:45,760 --> 05:17:47,260
Punished old Meso.

5185
05:17:48,080 --> 05:17:49,200
Old Mesa.

5186
05:17:50,560 --> 05:17:51,520
Oh my god.

5187
05:17:52,660 --> 05:17:56,340
But this time I had grown old and my powers were weak.

5188
05:17:57,200 --> 05:18:00,740
So I decided I needed to find somebody to help me this time
around.

5189
05:18:01,980 --> 05:18:03,840
That's why he lied about the dawn, right?

5190
05:18:04,000 --> 05:18:06,340
Just because everything had to be done tonight.

5191
05:18:06,620 --> 05:18:07,040
Aww.

5192
05:18:09,240 --> 05:18:11,780
Somebody who possessed different powers than me.

5193
05:18:13,280 --> 05:18:14,020
But wait a second.

5194
05:18:15,200 --> 05:18:17,160
You were able to manipulate that desk lamp.

5195
05:18:18,460 --> 05:18:21,760
Over the course of the long years, my powers changed.

5196
05:18:22,220 --> 05:18:27,980
My ability to swap objects weakened, but I became able to
manipulate small objects.

5197
05:18:29,020 --> 05:18:32,040
But in that case, why didn't you cooperate with yourself?

5198
05:18:32,840 --> 05:18:34,040
Because I couldn't.

5199
05:18:36,220 --> 05:18:38,920
Ten years and the joint made you an MGS...

5200
05:18:38,920 --> 05:18:40,620
I read.

5201
05:18:41,420 --> 05:18:41,780
Huh?

5202
05:18:42,740 --> 05:18:47,660
From watching the man in red, I found out there were
individual differences in our powers.

5203
05:18:47,680 --> 05:18:50,680
I couldn't do any of the things he could do.

5204
05:18:51,300 --> 05:18:53,660
Like travel through the telephone lines, for example.

5205
05:18:55,940 --> 05:18:59,260
It may not seem like much, but it's very important power.

5206
05:19:00,320 --> 05:19:02,380
Especially if you're trying to chase somebody.

5207
05:19:03,240 --> 05:19:03,760
Hmm.

5208
05:19:04,720 --> 05:19:06,160
But there's something I don't understand.

5209
05:19:06,960 --> 05:19:09,080
You knew from the very beginning that I had that power.

5210
05:19:09,700 --> 05:19:11,620
How did you know so much about me?

5211
05:19:12,480 --> 05:19:13,440
Why wouldn't I?

5212
05:19:14,040 --> 05:19:26,720
After all, we had met before on that night the first time
around we what we met before from listening to the

5213
05:19:26,720 --> 05:19:33,300
conversation of the two intruders to the apartment I learned
that miss Lynn had lost her life at that junkyard on the

5214
05:19:33,300 --> 05:19:41,680
edge of town I followed the ghost world path to the junkyard
and came upon an incredible scene

5215
05:19:51,310 --> 05:19:57,510
imagine if you will there in the darkness a twisting and
swiveling desk lamp.

5216
05:19:58,630 --> 05:20:01,430
It made my first and on end, I can tell you.

5217
05:20:02,330 --> 05:20:03,310
That was me?

5218
05:20:04,870 --> 05:20:08,110
So I was shot on that night the first time around as well.

5219
05:20:13,260 --> 05:20:14,940
You had lost your memory that time too.

5220
05:20:16,800 --> 05:20:18,800
You had just died and you felt confused.

5221
05:20:19,740 --> 05:20:20,760
You declined to cooperate.

5222
05:20:20,840 --> 05:20:23,120
You declined to cooperate with me.

5223
05:20:24,040 --> 05:20:24,920
I did what?

5224
05:20:28,460 --> 05:20:34,260
I just want to find my own memory i'm sorry but i can't help
you wait but that happened too that's what you said

5225
05:20:42,890 --> 05:20:51,010
whoa and then you disappeared oh a way over the telephone
line

5226
05:20:55,160 --> 05:21:03,700
i'm really sorry i didn't help you that's why i decided that
this time i would use that desire of yours to to our mutual

5227
05:21:03,700 --> 05:21:11,320
advantage mutual advantage The only thing you were
interested in was finding your own lost memory.

5228
05:21:12,260 --> 05:21:16,760
If I could guide you along the right path to doing that, we
would both benefit.

5229
05:21:17,380 --> 05:21:21,760
And namely the right path would be the path to the man in
red, to Yomiya.

5230
05:21:22,940 --> 05:21:23,420
What?

5231
05:21:23,880 --> 05:21:27,780
I gave you the information you needed to know to set you in
the right direction.

5232
05:21:29,180 --> 05:21:30,920
And then I gave you a time limit.

5233
05:21:32,160 --> 05:21:32,880
A time limit?

5234
05:21:34,100 --> 05:21:34,820
That's right.

5235
05:21:35,340 --> 05:21:37,540
As you know, I said you only had until tomorrow.

5236
05:21:37,560 --> 05:21:37,920
morning.

5237
05:21:39,160 --> 05:21:41,960
If I hadn't done that, you wouldn't have found out the truth
tonight.

5238
05:21:43,540 --> 05:21:47,960
And the man in red would have been sealed away at the bottom
of the sea forever.

5239
05:21:48,940 --> 05:21:51,840
If that had happened, it would have been all over.

5240
05:21:53,120 --> 05:21:54,080
Smart doggle.

5241
05:21:54,800 --> 05:21:57,980
Then you mean a thing about ceasing to exist?

5242
05:21:58,640 --> 05:22:00,180
Oh, that completely made up.

5243
05:22:00,420 --> 05:22:01,880
A little naughty of me, I know.

5244
05:22:03,160 --> 05:22:05,320
But I just wanted you to use your time wisely.

5245
05:22:05,400 --> 05:22:07,540
I really thought that the lamp was the wise.

5246
05:22:08,640 --> 05:22:13,420
Oh boy, I hate to admit it, but this little doggy really
outsmarted me in every way.

5247
05:22:14,540 --> 05:22:16,900
Let's just call it the wisdom that comes with age.

5248
05:22:20,450 --> 05:22:21,990
I didn't expect a missile!

5249
05:22:22,890 --> 05:22:23,670
Old missile!

5250
05:22:24,990 --> 05:22:26,610
And now it's time to say farewell.

5251
05:22:27,730 --> 05:22:31,370
These past ten years will cease to exist and with them, so
will I.

5252
05:22:32,630 --> 05:22:34,110
But you'll be regular missile!

5253
05:22:34,550 --> 05:22:36,490
You can rest now, old missile!

5254
05:22:37,530 --> 05:22:38,790
I believed in you.

5255
05:22:38,930 --> 05:22:41,170
I always knew you could do it.

5256
05:22:41,930 --> 05:22:42,730
And so you did.

5257
05:22:43,550 --> 05:22:43,990
Thank you.

5258
05:22:44,170 --> 05:22:45,930
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

5259
05:22:49,070 --> 05:22:51,930
Why do you keep timing it like this?

5260
05:22:56,660 --> 05:22:57,320
That's so polite.

5261
05:22:57,440 --> 05:22:58,560
It's like a damn poodle.

5262
05:23:02,260 --> 05:23:05,520
So you waited and waited these ten long years.

5263
05:23:07,720 --> 05:23:10,940
Well, for the sake of your two ladies, Lynn and Camilla, eh?

5264
05:23:12,500 --> 05:23:13,620
Of course.

5265
05:23:14,900 --> 05:23:17,020
That's because that's what doggies do!

5266
05:23:18,020 --> 05:23:18,360
Now then.

5267
05:23:18,700 --> 05:23:19,820
Farewell, sisal.

5268
05:23:21,740 --> 05:23:25,500
And so the story of a single night came to an end.

5269
05:23:25,780 --> 05:23:29,080
A single night that for us spanned across several weeks.

5270
05:23:29,500 --> 05:23:30,680
Oh, oh no, I can't even read it!

5271
05:23:30,960 --> 05:23:33,240
I made my way back to a new present.

5272
05:23:34,040 --> 05:23:37,200
I thought it was pushed to proceed.

5273
05:23:44,940 --> 05:23:48,480
I still best boy waited 20 years to help his masters.

5274
05:23:50,060 --> 05:23:51,380
Bestest boy ever.

5275
05:23:51,500 --> 05:23:55,580
How come it's dark?

5276
05:23:57,760 --> 05:24:00,700
This is not push also, so I'll just turn on the lights here.

5277
05:24:04,020 --> 05:24:04,300
Oh.

5278
05:24:12,800 --> 05:24:14,080
Oh my god.

5279
05:24:16,820 --> 05:24:17,460
There's no guns!

5280
05:24:18,660 --> 05:24:19,620
There's no gun!

5281
05:24:29,140 --> 05:24:30,500
Were you surprised?

5282
05:24:31,580 --> 05:24:32,380
You bet I was.

5283
05:24:32,520 --> 05:24:33,980
You nearly scared me to death.

5284
05:24:34,120 --> 05:24:36,040
Don't joke like that, Lynn.

5285
05:24:39,520 --> 05:24:39,920
Yippee!

5286
05:24:40,100 --> 05:24:40,840
It worked!

5287
05:24:42,840 --> 05:24:44,400
It's not even my birthday today.

5288
05:24:45,700 --> 05:24:47,980
It was my mom's birthday the day before yesterday.

5289
05:24:48,440 --> 05:24:51,880
I made this surprise for her, but it came out so well, I
want to use it again.

5290
05:24:53,100 --> 05:24:54,320
Do we get to see the mom?

5291
05:24:55,540 --> 05:24:56,380
That's all right, Lin.

5292
05:24:57,240 --> 05:25:00,480
After all, we're celebrating the birth of your new position
as detective, right?

5293
05:25:02,900 --> 05:25:03,400
Really?

5294
05:25:03,680 --> 05:25:04,780
Thank you, Detective Jowd.

5295
05:25:05,520 --> 05:25:06,820
Daddy, you're home.

5296
05:25:08,080 --> 05:25:08,600
Hi, Camilla.

5297
05:25:08,900 --> 05:25:09,780
Let me introduce you.

5298
05:25:10,100 --> 05:25:10,680
This is Lin.

5299
05:25:11,440 --> 05:25:13,180
She was just assigned to the Detective Division.

5300
05:25:13,820 --> 05:25:14,820
The Detective Division.

5301
05:25:20,500 --> 05:25:22,780
The Detective Division today.

5302
05:25:25,540 --> 05:25:26,760
It's nice to meet you.

5303
05:25:27,280 --> 05:25:30,660
Nice to meet you, too, and congratulations on becoming a
detective.

5304
05:25:32,000 --> 05:25:33,120
Wait, so...

5305
05:25:33,120 --> 05:25:34,580
But he should remember this, right?

5306
05:25:35,100 --> 05:25:36,580
I guess the two of them don't remember?

5307
05:25:37,060 --> 05:25:37,220
Huh?

5308
05:25:37,740 --> 05:25:38,500
There's something wrong?

5309
05:25:40,900 --> 05:25:42,540
Yeah, one of those badges, too.

5310
05:25:43,420 --> 05:25:43,840
Oh, this?

5311
05:25:44,000 --> 05:25:44,320
Yeah.

5312
05:25:46,080 --> 05:25:47,360
I have one just like it.

5313
05:25:47,440 --> 05:25:49,060
My dad gave it to me the other day.

5314
05:25:50,920 --> 05:25:52,600
But yours looks a lot older than mine.

5315
05:25:53,580 --> 05:25:55,520
How long are you going to keep wearing that toy bag?

5316
05:25:55,540 --> 05:26:05,100
badge Lynn oh what's wrong with it to me this is the symbol
of a real detective it's been 10 years since then hasn't it

5317
05:26:05,100 --> 05:26:12,220
who would have guessed you'd actually become a detective one
day when he gave me this badge I just knew I knew it was my

5318
05:26:12,220 --> 05:26:17,360
destiny somehow destiny hey

5319
05:26:20,920 --> 05:26:29,420
and now that I'm a detective I'll find out where that
destiny will lead me So they don't remember, but Yomiya,

5320
05:26:30,000 --> 05:26:34,680
Sisul, Missul, and Zhao to remember.

5321
05:26:35,740 --> 05:26:37,540
Haha, that you will, that you will.

5322
05:26:41,340 --> 05:26:42,380
Yeah, Sisul!

5323
05:26:44,460 --> 05:26:46,660
Don't tell me you're the same little kitten.

5324
05:26:47,540 --> 05:26:48,960
That's right, the very one.

5325
05:26:50,080 --> 05:26:50,560
You know what?

5326
05:26:50,660 --> 05:26:52,380
This is a very, very special cat.

5327
05:26:52,860 --> 05:26:54,560
He's 10 years old, but he's still a kitten!

5328
05:26:56,440 --> 05:26:57,640
Still a kitten.

5329
05:26:58,720 --> 05:27:00,740
Yep, he never got any bigger or anything.

5330
05:27:04,040 --> 05:27:05,600
Was he... does he have the...

5331
05:27:05,600 --> 05:27:07,440
Was he struck with the...

5332
05:27:07,440 --> 05:27:08,540
with the fragment?

5333
05:27:09,440 --> 05:27:10,820
What a mysterious little fellow.

5334
05:27:11,780 --> 05:27:12,300
I know, right?

5335
05:27:12,580 --> 05:27:13,560
His name is Sissel.

5336
05:27:16,020 --> 05:27:16,580
Sissel.

5337
05:27:18,800 --> 05:27:21,060
Seems to me I've heard that name somewhere before.

5338
05:27:22,400 --> 05:27:22,960
Really?

5339
05:27:23,360 --> 05:27:24,380
How mysterious.

5340
05:27:25,540 --> 05:27:27,360
I think Cicil likes you, Lin.

5341
05:27:28,280 --> 05:27:29,000
Lin Motomo.

5342
05:27:29,440 --> 05:27:29,780
Mom!

5343
05:27:30,800 --> 05:27:31,420
Oh my god.

5344
05:27:32,480 --> 05:27:33,240
All right, everyone.

5345
05:27:33,640 --> 05:27:34,700
Let's start the celebration.

5346
05:27:35,720 --> 05:27:36,480
Okay, Mom.

5347
05:27:43,010 --> 05:27:44,530
She's so, so cute.

5348
05:27:47,490 --> 05:27:49,670
I bet you're just like me.

5349
05:27:50,290 --> 05:27:52,430
Your destiny led you here somehow, too.

5350
05:27:56,390 --> 05:27:56,770
Meow.

5351
05:27:58,470 --> 05:28:00,130
I'm so glad everybody lived.

5352
05:28:01,250 --> 05:28:02,110
again, Sissel.

5353
05:28:05,490 --> 05:28:05,730
Yay!

5354
05:28:08,030 --> 05:28:12,390
From just that single night as a human, I got a glimpse into
their world and I learned something.

5355
05:28:13,010 --> 05:28:13,750
Wait, where's Missal?

5356
05:28:14,610 --> 05:28:15,290
Where's Missal?

5357
05:28:15,750 --> 05:28:17,830
Their fates, their lives, they were all interconnected.

5358
05:28:18,570 --> 05:28:20,290
Somewhere, somehow, in some way.

5359
05:28:22,490 --> 05:28:23,310
Where's Missal?

5360
05:28:25,330 --> 05:28:27,770
And now, this is my new fate.

5361
05:28:30,130 --> 05:28:30,510
Oh!

5362
05:28:33,870 --> 05:28:35,430
I'm a ghost cat.

5363
05:28:37,090 --> 05:28:37,770
Oh my gosh, she...

5364
05:28:39,130 --> 05:28:40,530
Look at that spaghetti!

5365
05:28:41,850 --> 05:28:43,110
That's the best plate ever!

5366
05:28:43,230 --> 05:28:44,230
I guess I really am a cat.

5367
05:28:44,410 --> 05:28:46,010
It's just fine to curl up and watch.

5368
05:28:46,630 --> 05:28:47,450
Oh, it's too fast.

5369
05:28:47,550 --> 05:28:50,510
And it looks like plenty to watch here for quite a while.

5370
05:28:52,210 --> 05:28:53,190
Where is Missile?

5371
05:28:55,150 --> 05:28:59,090
I was too distracted by the spaghetti to read the text.

5372
05:29:13,280 --> 05:29:14,520
Like I said, it isn't my...

5373
05:29:14,540 --> 05:29:25,020
birthday oh my god missile hey missile i thought i asked you
to stay home and guard the fort the birthdays are for

5374
05:29:25,020 --> 05:29:31,800

like it baby oh he's eating the spaghetti the best detective

5375
05:29:31,800 --> 05:29:39,420
eats the best meal yeah oh my god look at mataro just
sitting there with her wine

5376
05:29:51,670 --> 05:30:01,090
No way Look at this wannabe Look at this You don't even have
half Your pinky toe doesn't even have a fraction of his

5377
05:30:01,090 --> 05:30:08,650
smoothness Definitely not good Maybe now I can be a great
detective Just like Inspector Cabanella What kind of example

5378
05:30:08,650 --> 05:30:10,770
is the inspector providing for his men?

5379
05:30:18,800 --> 05:30:26,400
Such a great game Oh his toes are out Even at the boss Oh,
my goodness gracious.

5380
05:30:27,000 --> 05:30:28,040
Here's your food, gentlemen.

5381
05:30:29,380 --> 05:30:31,860
She's still looking for someone.

5382
05:30:32,180 --> 05:30:32,960
Ew, the toes.

5383
05:30:33,120 --> 05:30:33,480
Oh, my God.

5384
05:30:34,020 --> 05:30:35,600
Memory, what are you doing here?

5385
05:30:36,540 --> 05:30:40,360
I heard you were going to be picking some new members for
the Special Investigation Unit today.

5386
05:30:41,000 --> 05:30:44,160
So you took on a part-time job here again just so you could
eavesdrop?

5387
05:30:44,520 --> 05:30:45,540
I forgot about this.

5388
05:30:45,660 --> 05:30:46,980
I forgot about it again.

5389
05:30:47,820 --> 05:30:50,700
Oh, you have no idea the lengths I'd go to reach my goals.

5390
05:31:06,320 --> 05:31:06,760
Oh.

5391
05:31:09,480 --> 05:31:11,640
Thank you for the awesome playthrough.

5392
05:31:14,420 --> 05:31:16,040
I've never cooked this way before.

5393
05:31:18,560 --> 05:31:21,780
Tumeric, coriander, cumin, and...

5394
05:31:23,000 --> 05:31:25,200
Is this really necessary?

5395
05:31:25,920 --> 05:31:27,020
This new curry chicken.

5396
05:31:28,440 --> 05:31:30,000
Very best customer requested it.

5397
05:31:30,280 --> 05:31:32,040
What about the other country?

5398
05:31:32,160 --> 05:31:37,440
I guess they're not interested because there was never...

5399
05:31:37,720 --> 05:31:39,280
I don't think I could eat another buy.

5400
05:31:40,000 --> 05:31:42,440
So it's who exactly is this very best customer anyway.

5401
05:31:43,500 --> 05:31:44,020
Is it missile?

5402
05:31:44,400 --> 05:31:44,540
Oh.

5403
05:31:44,720 --> 05:31:46,020
Oh, it's this guy.

5404
05:31:49,660 --> 05:31:51,780
I really enjoyed your playthrough of Ghost Dricks.

5405
05:31:51,940 --> 05:31:52,800
Thank you.

5406
05:31:53,180 --> 05:31:53,760
Thank you.

05:31:53,760 --> 05:31:54,040
Thank you.

5408
05:32:00,520 --> 05:32:00,880
Um.

5409
05:32:02,220 --> 05:32:03,400
What was I going to say?

5410
05:32:04,720 --> 05:32:08,280
I guess, yeah, the other country doesn't get involved
because...

5411
05:32:08,280 --> 05:32:10,700
Oh, here they are doing other activities.

5412
05:32:11,100 --> 05:32:12,240
Are you sure we really need...

5413
05:32:12,260 --> 05:32:20,540
all these explosives not to worry beauty my dear i follow
the instructions exactly 20 kilograms of gunpowder just like

Death to Shaggy!

5418
05:32:51,960 --> 05:32:53,980
Aw, but my wife also died.

5419
05:32:54,200 --> 05:32:54,840
That's so sad.

5420
05:32:59,200 --> 05:33:01,020
So this is where you work, huh, Papa?

5421
05:33:02,420 --> 05:33:02,800
Papa!

5422
05:33:03,100 --> 05:33:04,440
Why did I say it like that?

5423
05:33:04,800 --> 05:33:05,920
That's right, sweetheart.

5424
05:33:07,300 --> 05:33:11,040
Darling, husband, don't you have any idea at all you could
give me?

5425
05:33:11,780 --> 05:33:13,660
You must have heard some juicy stories.

5426
05:33:14,280 --> 05:33:16,020
The indiscretion of a minister?

5427
05:33:16,580 --> 05:33:17,080
No, no.

5428
05:33:17,380 --> 05:33:19,340
Must you talk that way in front of our darling angel?

5429

5438
05:33:41,080 --> 05:33:42,900
I don't think the game needs a sequel.

5439
05:33:43,800 --> 05:33:51,940
Hoping that potential sequel alive this deal is going quite

It's so awesome.

5448
05:34:35,260 --> 05:34:37,380
I can see why some people say it's their favorite game.

5449
05:34:39,200 --> 05:34:39,920
Or one of them.

5450
05:34:41,140 --> 05:34:42,220
I love Pigeon Man.

5451
05:34:42,680 --> 05:34:44,080

05:34:44,400 --> 05:34:45,520
Pigeons rocking out.

5454
05:34:48,080 --> 05:34:50,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, my God.

5455

Stop the poor for me.

5456
05:34:53,820 --> 05:34:55,480
Oh, I didn't get to read it.

5457
05:34:57,840 --> 05:34:58,240
Yeah!

5458
05:35:02,960 --> 05:35:05,060
They didn't bother changing his prison outfit.

5459
05:35:05,380 --> 05:35:06,340
I guess that's fine.

5460
05:35:13,870 --> 05:35:17,530
They planned a Ghost Trick 2 where Phoenix Wright dies.

5461
05:35:17,730 --> 05:35:18,370
That'd be awesome.

5462
05:35:19,650 --> 05:35:20,690
Today's the day, you know.

5463
05:35:20,850 --> 05:35:22,170
It's finally getting out.

5464
05:35:23,290 --> 05:35:24,330
Oh, he's doing the panic thing.

5465
05:35:24,670 --> 05:35:28,210
You know, everybody's starting to get real tired of seeing
you do that.

5466
05:35:28,630 --> 05:35:34,870
Now let me show you a new dance that's been passed down in
our family Oh, we do this when we have a stomach ache!

5467
05:35:35,810 --> 05:35:37,930
We call it Dance Away the Pain!

5468
05:35:38,790 --> 05:35:40,850
Oh, I'm real interested in that one.

5469
05:35:41,150 --> 05:35:43,270
I think you could show it to me, say, next week.

5470
05:35:43,970 --> 05:35:44,610
You got it!

5471
05:35:48,470 --> 05:35:50,790

5474
05:35:58,430 --> 05:36:02,430
Oh, he's getting out!

05:36:06,870 --> 05:36:17,830
Ten young long years yo-yo your time's up today the young

05:37:17,640 --> 05:37:18,740

Oh my goodness.

5485
05:37:27,680 --> 05:37:28,340
So cute.

5486
05:37:33,080 --> 05:37:34,800
The mom took the photo.

5487
05:37:36,060 --> 05:37:37,580
Oh, yeah, I guess that makes sense.

5488
05:37:37,740 --> 05:37:41,380
I mean, she wasn't in the game, like, 99% of it, so...

5489
05:37:42,340 --> 05:37:43,720
Oh my gosh.

5490
05:37:45,480 --> 05:37:47,280
I want to go hug my pets now.

5491
05:37:47,900 --> 05:37:49,840
I want to go hug pies and butaro.

5492
05:37:50,720 --> 05:37:51,880
I want to go hug them.

5493
05:37:51,980 --> 05:37:58,260
I want to especially because Cicel looks so much like pies.

5494
05:38:01,980 --> 05:38:06,000
I thought it might take about six hours to beat and we're a
little under that.

5495
05:38:06,620 --> 05:38:08,120
So nice.

5496
05:38:09,140 --> 05:38:12,060

05:38:21,530 --> 05:38:22,610
Go hug them.

5499
05:38:22,750 --> 05:38:23,390
I will after...

5500
05:38:23,390 --> 05:38:23,530
Oh!

5501
05:38:25,310 --> 05:38:26,030
Is that a donut?

5502
05:38:28,170 --> 05:38:28,830
There it go.

5503
05:38:35,000 --> 05:38:36,160
Oh, there's the rat!

5504
05:38:37,180 --> 05:38:37,940
Get that rat.

5505
05:38:38,580 --> 05:38:39,520
Get that rat.

5506
05:38:41,640 --> 05:38:43,660
There are so many rats in this game.

5507
05:38:45,480 --> 05:38:46,860
Congrats on the completion of one of my faves.

5508
05:38:47,020 --> 05:38:49,640
I love how despite all the craziness, everything somehow
gets explained in the end.

5509
05:38:50,540 --> 05:38:51,020
best.

5510
05:38:51,720 --> 05:38:53,040
Yeah, Missile the best.

5511
05:38:53,660 --> 05:38:54,800
Thanks for the pink bikini.

5512
05:38:55,060 --> 05:38:57,240
Thanks for such a fun playthrough of such a great game.

5513
05:38:58,100 --> 05:38:59,920
Oh, that was so awesome.

5514
05:39:01,060 --> 05:39:03,200
Oh my gosh, I'm so glad that I played it.

5515
05:39:03,420 --> 05:39:06,180
Oh my god, I'm so glad I played it.

5516
05:39:10,480 --> 05:39:11,580
That's so good.

5517
05:39:11,920 --> 05:39:13,040
This is good, isn't it?

5518
05:39:13,080 --> 05:39:13,960
Oh, Missile.

5519
05:39:14,800 --> 05:39:18,120
I can't believe the lamp was Missile all along.

5520
05:39:19,260 --> 05:39:22,040
Waiting the 10 years.

5521
05:39:24,360 --> 05:39:25,320
That's crazy!

5522
05:39:26,800 --> 05:39:31,380
Waiting the 10 years for the whole thing to happen over
again.

5523
05:39:32,380 --> 05:39:33,420
Oh my god.

5524
05:39:34,380 --> 05:39:35,680
No, it was so good.

5525
05:39:36,020 --> 05:39:37,580
Missou's best boy.

5526
05:39:38,300 --> 05:39:38,780
Missou.

5527
05:39:39,280 --> 05:39:41,380
Look at you, look at the Capcom logo.

5528
05:39:42,480 --> 05:39:44,000
Oh, I like the picture of the meteor.

5529
05:39:44,200 --> 05:39:45,080
It's so pretty.

5530
05:39:45,520 --> 05:39:48,040
This is my first time experiencing this game, doing it
alongside you.

5531
05:39:48,300 --> 05:39:50,180
And your voice acting was an absolute treat.

5532
05:39:51,080 --> 05:39:53,120
Sorry, my voice acting maybe was a little incandescent.

5533
05:39:53,140 --> 05:39:55,260
but it was still fun to do.

5534
05:39:55,580 --> 05:39:58,200
Really looking forward, really look forward to them these
past few weeks.

5535
05:39:58,680 --> 05:39:59,180
Thank you.

5536
05:39:59,740 --> 05:40:03,320
Oh my gosh, Cecil background, so cute!

5537
05:40:05,500 --> 05:40:05,940
Reincarnation.

5538
05:40:07,760 --> 05:40:09,800
I noticed that there was like ghost puzzles.

5539
05:40:12,800 --> 05:40:15,600
Like, um, there was like some, oh, the challenges, right?

5540
05:40:15,700 --> 05:40:19,140
There was like some other challenges towards the end that
was like, solve...

5541
05:40:23,120 --> 05:40:23,560
Oh!

5542
05:40:24,700 --> 05:40:26,980
Lead the way outside without failing.

5543
05:40:27,560 --> 05:40:32,520
Avert fate without deaths after the final fate change.

5544
05:40:32,920 --> 05:40:33,780
So we got one.

5545
05:40:33,980 --> 05:40:34,780
Too much medicine.

5546
05:40:35,480 --> 05:40:37,800
Take aim and nail it on the second try.

5547
05:40:38,620 --> 05:40:40,520
Fail by keeping the ball away from Mino.

5548
05:40:41,980 --> 05:40:42,920
We got this one too.

5549
05:40:43,320 --> 05:40:45,780
Fail by removing a large symbol.

5550
05:40:49,300 --> 05:40:50,840
Clear all challenges.

5551
05:40:51,960 --> 05:40:52,440
Complete...

5552
05:40:52,440 --> 05:40:52,820
This!

5553
05:40:53,040 --> 05:40:54,680
The 5x5 Ghost Puzzle.

5554
05:40:54,700 --> 05:40:55,800
What are these?

5555
05:40:57,180 --> 05:40:58,000
Ghost puzzle.

5556
05:40:59,300 --> 05:41:00,100
Lynn's apartment?

5557
05:41:03,000 --> 05:41:03,680
Oh.

5558
05:41:04,300 --> 05:41:04,880
Oh.

5559
05:41:05,200 --> 05:41:05,720
Oh.

5560
05:41:06,700 --> 05:41:07,240
Oh.

5561
05:41:07,660 --> 05:41:08,340
Oh.

5562
05:41:09,200 --> 05:41:09,820
Oh.

5563
05:41:09,820 --> 05:41:09,920
Oh.

5564
05:41:10,140 --> 05:41:10,560
No.

5565
05:41:10,920 --> 05:41:11,580
No.

5566
05:41:12,080 --> 05:41:12,880
Get me out of here.

5567
05:41:13,740 --> 05:41:15,980
We'll be here for the next five hours.

5568
05:41:17,240 --> 05:41:18,520
He technically waited 20 years.

5569
05:41:18,620 --> 05:41:19,860
The cat left him the first time.

5570
05:41:20,180 --> 05:41:20,820
That's right.

5571
05:41:20,920 --> 05:41:21,500
You're right.

5572
05:41:22,600 --> 05:41:23,780
It's a tile puzzle.

5573
05:41:24,700 --> 05:41:25,520
Oh my gosh, okay.

5574
05:41:26,340 --> 05:41:27,520
Thanks for the great stream, Zvinto!

5575
05:41:30,900 --> 05:41:31,780
Thank you!

5576
05:41:35,160 --> 05:41:38,120
It's cool though that the puzzle is moving, that's so fun.

5577
05:41:41,460 --> 05:41:42,180
Oh wow!

5578
05:41:45,830 --> 05:41:46,850
Look at him go!

5579
05:42:00,940 --> 05:42:05,340
My brain is actually this, this is, this feels, makes it so
much more difficult.

5580
05:42:05,840 --> 05:42:07,300
How am I supposed to know what's in the map?

5581
05:42:07,320 --> 05:42:13,500
middle because they're all moving right wait how am i

5585
05:42:46,470 --> 05:42:47,290
There we go!

5586
05:42:48,590 --> 05:42:49,670

Thank you.

5590
05:42:57,630 --> 05:42:59,170
What if I do a hint?

5591
05:42:59,550 --> 05:42:59,930
Oh!

5592
05:43:00,470 --> 05:43:02,190

Oh, by five and eight are mixed up.

5597
05:43:10,290 --> 05:43:12,010
Oh, well, I think I already knew that actually.

5598
05:43:13,210 --> 05:43:16,710
Anyway, okay, I don't want to be here all night because I'm
stupid.

5599
05:43:23,940 --> 05:43:24,580
Memories?

5600
05:43:36,680 --> 05:43:37,980
All these fun characters.

5601
05:43:38,880 --> 05:43:40,640
Oh, beloved mother.

5602
05:43:45,890 --> 05:43:46,790
The other me.

5603
05:43:53,430 --> 05:43:55,690
Why doesn't the top text change?

5604
05:43:55,830 --> 05:43:56,930
But the bottom text changes.

5605
05:43:57,130 --> 05:43:57,470
That's weird.

5606
05:43:58,910 --> 05:44:02,310
Also, where is Cicil?

5607
05:44:04,050 --> 05:44:06,310
Did I just miss him?

5608
05:44:09,270 --> 05:44:10,530
Oh gosh, it's...

5609
05:44:10,530 --> 05:44:11,330
Who is this?

5610
05:44:11,570 --> 05:44:14,430
Oh, that's the Fastidious Glass Polisher.

5611
05:44:15,510 --> 05:44:16,890
Black-hearted blue woman.

5612
05:44:21,020 --> 05:44:23,440
The change is over the course of the game.

5613
05:44:23,620 --> 05:44:25,260
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

5614
05:44:27,700 --> 05:44:28,200
Oh my god.

5615
05:44:28,680 --> 05:44:30,780
Missile has seven pages.

5616
05:44:32,680 --> 05:44:33,880
Friendly little Pomeranian.

5617
05:44:33,980 --> 05:44:38,680
His name is Missal, thinking he needs his powers to protect
the little lady he chose not to be brought back to life.

5618
05:44:39,060 --> 05:44:43,160
He went back in time 10 years with me to help fight the last
battle against fate.

5619
05:44:46,440 --> 05:44:46,580
Me.

5620
05:44:46,900 --> 05:44:47,580
The mystery.

5621
05:44:50,840 --> 05:44:53,740
I lost my life at a lonely spot in the outskirts of town.

5622
05:44:53,860 --> 05:44:54,620
My name is Sisal.

5623
05:44:56,320 --> 05:44:58,220
Okay, and then it...

5624
05:44:58,220 --> 05:44:59,640
Oh, I see how it changes.

5625
05:44:59,760 --> 05:45:00,600
Like, is that me?

5626
05:45:00,900 --> 05:45:01,240
Okay.

5627
05:45:03,160 --> 05:45:03,960
It's not...

5628
05:45:03,980 --> 05:45:04,700
Not me!

5629
05:45:08,520 --> 05:45:10,260
Oh, and then he turns into a wisp.

5630
05:45:11,540 --> 05:45:12,980
But it doesn't show him as the cat.

5631
05:45:13,920 --> 05:45:16,440
It's interesting.

5632
05:45:18,240 --> 05:45:18,880
Hmm.

5633
05:45:23,130 --> 05:45:23,770
Illustrations.

5634
05:45:25,830 --> 05:45:26,230
Oh!

5635
05:45:27,310 --> 05:45:28,770
Wait, this is so cool!

5636
05:45:28,870 --> 05:45:29,310
Wait.

5637
05:45:30,630 --> 05:45:32,990
Missile was almost not a Pomeranian!

5638
05:45:34,150 --> 05:45:36,310
Missile was almost a bulldog!

5639
05:45:43,760 --> 05:45:47,500
Blue-haired Camilla, blue-haired Camilla, blue-haired
short-haired Camilla, blue-short-haired Camilla,

5640
05:45:47,540 --> 05:45:51,340
blue-short-haired Camilla, blue-short-haired Camilla,
blue-short-haired Camilla, come back to me!

5641
05:45:51,460 --> 05:45:52,800
Blue-short-haired Camilla!

5642
05:45:54,920 --> 05:45:57,240
Oh my god, baby Camilla!

5643
05:45:58,220 --> 05:45:59,100
Little baby!

5644
05:46:03,780 --> 05:46:04,220
Yeah!

5645
05:46:04,780 --> 05:46:06,000
Wait, this one's so awesome!

5646
05:46:06,360 --> 05:46:07,500
Actually, they're all awesome!

5647
05:46:07,880 --> 05:46:08,380
Whoops, sorry.

5648
05:46:10,440 --> 05:46:11,320
The goatee!

5649
05:46:16,260 --> 05:46:24,300

Very hard.

5653
05:46:47,960 --> 05:46:49,400
It's the goggles.

5654
05:46:49,680 --> 05:46:50,160
It's the goggles.

5655
05:47:04,410 --> 05:47:04,850
Funny.

5656
05:47:08,770 --> 05:47:09,290
Oh, wow.

5657
05:47:09,410 --> 05:47:10,110
She looks so different.

5658
05:47:10,350 --> 05:47:12,350
No, I like the design that they went with, though.

5659
05:47:14,550 --> 05:47:15,570
Who the hell is this?

5660
05:47:17,350 --> 05:47:18,330
Who is this?

5661
05:47:18,470 --> 05:47:19,350
Is this the dog?

5662
05:47:19,370 --> 05:47:19,630
Water?

5663
05:47:21,190 --> 05:47:21,550
Huh?

5664
05:47:22,130 --> 05:47:23,870
I like the melon pond in her head.

5665
05:47:26,950 --> 05:47:27,610
Who is this?

5666
05:47:28,510 --> 05:47:30,470
I was just thinking totally spies.

5668
05:47:36,810 --> 05:47:38,510
Who are these people?

5669
05:47:41,670 --> 05:47:42,190

05:47:44,490 --> 05:47:46,150

As a proud black cat owner, I'm glad Cicil got a happy
ending.

5685
05:49:18,120 --> 05:49:20,840
Congrats on beating the game, it's been such a wild ride.

05:50:03,670 --> 05:50:05,650
I like how there's a range and then the origin.

5691
05:50:12,740 --> 05:50:13,540
Changing fate.

5692
05:50:31,030 --> 05:50:31,430

And, um, it was so fun.

05:50:54,670 --> 05:50:56,430
Oh my gosh, I just realized it's so behind.

5705
05:50:58,410 --> 05:50:58,750
Maybe.

5706
05:51:00,470 --> 05:51:04,390

same as well.
