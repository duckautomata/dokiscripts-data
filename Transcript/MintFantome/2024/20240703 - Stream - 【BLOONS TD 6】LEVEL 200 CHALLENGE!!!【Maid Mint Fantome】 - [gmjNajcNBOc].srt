00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,110
Hello!

2
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,190
Welcome back, master!

3
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,010
Hello!

4
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,730
Howdy!

5
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,670
Howdy doody!

6
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:15,530
Hi!

7
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,630
It's bloons in time!

8
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,510
Howdy doody!

9
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,170
Howdy!

10
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,130
Why are we saying howdy?

11
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,820
Um... bloons?

12
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,800
Anybody?

13
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,560
Anybody up for a round of bloons?

14
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:52,940
Yes?

15
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,160
Ice Monkey?

16
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,820
That guy has to be 0-0-0.

17
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,520
So, today I kinda wanna do a challenge where I want to...

18
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,660
I think last time I played, I just got reset.

19
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,420
Recently, kind of over... 100?

20
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:12,980
Maybe?

21
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,320
Today?

22
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,120
Today we will do 200!

23
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,800
I think.

24
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:27,480
Um... as you can see, my highest round of all time is 183.

25
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,920
So I'm kinda close.

26
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,840
If anything, I'm kind of a genius.

27
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,980
A veritable cornucopia of games and streamers to watch.

28
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,560
And I'm watching this girl play a flash game...

29
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:38,620
Hey!

30
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:38,920
Hey!

31
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,060
Hey!

32
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,200
Hey!

33
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,640
Is it really from E-Bomb's world?

34
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,040
Blueberry...

35
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,570
Seeing as mint is a wall...

36
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,570
Level 200, here we come.

37
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,470
What do you mean by that?

38
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,430
Why am I a wall?

39
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,830
Are you a genius?

40
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:03,530
Yes.

41
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,010
Absolutely.

42
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,690
Where is Ice Monkey?

43
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,170
He's coming!

44
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,330
Aren't you here for me too?

45
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,450
Or are you only here for Ice Monkey?

46
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,850
Come on.

47
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,170
We'll see Ice Monkey when we see Ice Monkey.

48
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,510
Chibi Minto!

49
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,870
I thought it kind of matched the vibes of this game.

50
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,650
Because I feel like a baby.

51
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,250
Actually, no.

52
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,490
There's a lot of strategy in this game.

53
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,130
Right.

54
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,930
There's a lot of strategy in this game.

55
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,270
Sniper Monkey is my top monkey.

56
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,930
I didn't know Sato was my top hero though.

57
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,190
Oh, wait.

58
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,090
No, that makes sense.

59
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,290
I use her the most.

60
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,570
I forgot that I...

61
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,430
I got her the skin.

62
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,830
I bought the skin, you guys.

63
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,930
Except, I didn't spend real money.

64
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,410
You don't have to worry about that.

65
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,950
You don't have to worry about that.

66
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,930
Did you hear Magic Knight Braillers is getting into anime?

67
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:05,710
I did!

68
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,730
There's like so many.

69
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,530
Also, not only just Magic Knight Braillers.

70
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:17,330
But also, Rose of Versailles is getting a new movie that's animated by MAPPA.

71
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,750
I'm shocked.

72
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,130
I'm shocked.

73
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,070
And Ranma!

74
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:25,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

75
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,110
And Ranma!

76
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,170
It's so crazy.

77
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,250
Let me know.

78
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,070
Is the music too loud?

79
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,710
To me, it feels loud.

80
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,410
Maybe because the song just drives me crazy.

81
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,750
Which one should we do, guys?

82
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,870
Let's do a warm-up or something.

83
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,290
I was playing Bloons earlier.

84
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,350
Bonus rewards?

85
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,010
What kind of bonus?

86
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,350
It's loud?

87
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:56,990
Oh, okay.

88
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:57,730
So it's not just me.

89
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,670
Is that better?

90
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,410
The Supai is for Ice Monkey.

91
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,030
I'll pass it along.

92
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:20,990
This will cover the entire cost for you to buy Killer is Dead on sale in the Steam sale.

93
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,610
I'm bribing you to play a terrible game I love.

94
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,470
What is it?

95
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,270
I'll look it up right now.

96
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,290
Killer is Dead.

97
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,830
I'm looking it up.

98
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,350
I'm looking it up right now.

99
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,370
Thank you.

100
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,650
Thank you.

101
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,330
Kiss.

102
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,210
Kiss.

103
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,130
I just watched the podcast.

104
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,370
It's Tradewinds 2.

105
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,010
The old pirate game you were talking about.

106
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:43,790
Let me see.

107
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,090
Yo, this game has mixed reviews.

108
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,490
What are you trying to get me to play?

109
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,570
Oh, it's Grasshopper though.

110
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,590
Maddie.

111
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,550
What was I looking up?

112
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,190
Oh, yeah.

113
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,070
Tradewinds.

114
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,370
Hold on.

115
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,510
Tradewinds 2.

116
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,970
It doesn't sound like it, but it might be.

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,200
I don't think so.

118
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,980
I remember more of the ships being like a top-down 2D when they're going around.

119
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,940
But it looks kind of similar.

120
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,580
I think.

121
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,740
I think you're on the right path there, David.

122
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:32,980
Hmm.

123
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,880
Hmm.

124
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,760
Maybe that means someone randomized the order of the reviews.

125
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,980
All Suda51 games have mixed reviews.

126
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,740
Playing Bloons 2 and the overlapping BGMs is a trip.

127
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,620
Well, don't worry.

128
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,580
We'll start right now.

129
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,560
Where are we dropping, boys?

130
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,740
Is this MrBeastMonkey?

131
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,620
Is this MrBeastMonkey?

132
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,140
Mondozappa, my beloved.

133
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,600
My beloved.

134
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,920
Kill the past.

135
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,580
Play the mediocre.

136
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,440
Yes?

137
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,520
Yes.

138
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:17,720
Yes.

139
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,060
Oh my gosh.

140
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:27,560
You can tell that I'd never have been to this page because I didn't even know that it was called a MrBeastAwesomer pack.

141
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,360
It's $10.

142
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,520
Buy it.

143
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,720
What does it come with?

144
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,320
Exclusive avatar.

145
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,960
And banner for your profile.

146
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,340
10,000 monkey bucks.

147
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,840
Powerful tier 5 insta dart monkey.

148
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,240
Tier 5 insta bomb shooter.

149
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:52,920
Tier 5...

150
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,320
I never use any of those anyway.

151
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,160
So I don't need them.

152
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,080
I never use them anyway.

153
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,200
Let's go!

154
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,060
I've been trying to...

155
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,040
Let's do this.

156
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,380
We'll do this one on hard.

157
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,160
Right?

158
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,180
MrBeastMonkey.

159
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,740
No!

160
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,000
Is this clash of clans?

161
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,040
Clash of...

162
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,080
Clash of...

163
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,480
Yeah, there's one clan that's the monkey clan and one clan that's the balloon clan.

164
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,280
You know?

165
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,740
We'll do this one on hard.

166
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,240
What I've been trying to do...

167
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,640
Is...

168
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,280
Get my...

169
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,720
These guys...

170
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,060
Oh.

171
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,480
Wait.

172
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,920
Where should I stand?

173
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,080
Where do you guys want me?

174
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,240
Oh.

175
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,060
No, no, no, no.

176
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,260
Where do you guys want me?

177
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,500
Where's the best spot for me?

178
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,200
In the...

179
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,780
In the lake?

180
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,080
I can go right here.

181
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,940
No way!

182
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,240
I'm going to be putting boats here.

183
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,630
I have to go.

184
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,530
At home.

185
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,490
I could be at the house.

186
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,050
I fit right in!

187
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,090
Oh my gosh, I look like I'm from Candy Land right now!

188
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,050
I fit right in!

189
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:11,770
Knock knock!

190
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,210
Minto's home!

191
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,670
Actually, I'm here to sell you something.

192
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,030
At your doorstep.

193
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:19,890
Open up!

194
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,230
I have real candy!

195
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,990
Never just buy it from me, it's real!

196
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,050
I'll sell you real candy!

197
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,110
You're taller than the house?

198
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,630
Wow, do you want to just not see me at all?

199
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,190
Here, I'll even go smaller.

200
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,310
I can't even... there we go.

201
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,130
Now I can fit through the door.

202
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,330
Perfect!

203
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,490
HOA says you can't keep your creatures outside...

204
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:53,870
That's rude.

205
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:56,990
In the loop?

206
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:58,750
Right here?

207
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,210
But something's gonna go here.

208
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:02,710
Me!

209
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,990
I go right here.

210
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,290
Oh my gosh!

211
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,170
Me in one loop and Ice Monkey in the other!

212
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,490
It's kind of genius!

213
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,310
Okay, we'll keep it like this for now.

214
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,570
We'll keep it like this for now.

215
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,290
Here, I'm gonna put her right here.

216
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,390
I have unfinished business.

217
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,310
Oh, wow, it's loud.

218
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:26,870
Hold on.

219
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,530
Whoa, whoa!

220
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,250
Whoa, whoa!

221
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,170
Hold on, it's so loud.

222
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,490
You know what?

223
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,130
I don't... she's not as fun as Quincy.

224
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,170
Yes.

225
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:39,570
Yes.

226
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,350
Yes.

227
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,670
I'm doing my part!

228
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:45,890
Over here.

229
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,290
Yes.

230
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,150
Yes.

231
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,150
Yes.

232
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:56,550
Yes.

233
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:56,850
Yes.

234
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:57,230
Yes.

235
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,770
Would you condemn Ice Monkey?

236
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,890
Oh, you're right!

237
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,010
If I put Ice Monkey here, he'll have to work!

238
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,810
Oh, did you guys hear that?

239
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,050
Hi, Paz!

240
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,110
Hi, little baby girl!

241
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,590
What are you doing in here?

242
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,910
You want in my chair?

243
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,070
You want in my chair?

244
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,270
No, don't plop.

245
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:19,790
No!

246
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,710
That's my cat.

247
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,150
Let's see.

248
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,710
Who should we...

249
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,370
Sixty days!

250
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,870
Let's hear it for sixty days!

251
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,570
Woohoo!

252
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,470
Sixty days!

253
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,030
That's a long time.

254
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,230
Thank you!

255
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:44,810
Let's see.

256
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,930
I'm gonna put in a boat monkey.

257
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:48,910
Right here.

258
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,550
Right here.

259
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,550
Okay, we'll alternate.

260
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,570
This will be the boat.

261
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:55,790
This will be the sub.

262
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,270
This will be the sub.

263
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,530
This will be the boat.

264
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,200
Ah!

265
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,700
There's a man in my house!

266
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,330
I think we go 0-2-2 made monkey.

267
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,830
Robbery!

268
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,450
Don't look at me like that!

269
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,870
Why are you looking at me like that?

270
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,390
What do you want?

271
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,050
What do you want, little girl?

272
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,510
You're so crazy.

273
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,290
You're just a crazy little girl.

274
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,310
That's my cat.

275
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,370
She's so crazy.

276
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,450
I love her though.

277
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,210
She's so funny.

278
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,750
There's a house around your man.

279
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,470
Oh my god, he's so fast!

280
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,310
Wait, where's the other one?

281
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,890
He's like here?

282
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,270
Ah!

283
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,910
Sorry.

284
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,240
Level up.

285
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,980
How many have you killed?

286
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,120
Oh.

287
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,970
I want to see Ice Monkey juggle.

288
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,890
Where should we put Ice Monkey?

289
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:23,570
I think we can place Ice Monkey in a good spot that allows for optimal entertainment for everybody.

290
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,030
Oh my gosh, look!

291
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,330
His range is really bad!

292
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,970
If he just stands right here, everyone will be able..

293
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,530
Oh my gosh, you can put him right on the..

294
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,930
What if I put Ice Monkey right underneath me?

295
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,810
Wait, will it look like I'm juggling?

296
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,410
If Ice Monkey is underneath me...

297
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,510
If I'm on top of Ice Monkey...

298
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,970
But then he'll work.

299
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,450
I'll just sell him before any bloop...

300
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,930
Any bloop... Okay, hold on.

301
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:49,750
I'm gonna juggle!

302
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,190
Watch me juggle!

303
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,780
Isn't that crazy?

304
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,080
The things live 2D can do nowadays.

305
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,340
Just like the thumbnail.

306
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,960
It's true.

307
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,880
I need a monkey asset to put on top.

308
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,440
Okay, Ice Monkey.

309
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:17,980
I don't want...

310
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,820
I'm juggling!

311
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,760
Crop your head?

312
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,000
Wait, hold on.

313
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,680
You're kind of a genius?

314
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,260
Oh!

315
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,020
I'm the monkey now!

316
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,680
Wait, hold on.

317
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,080
Let me also get rid of the shadow.

318
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,040
For immersion's sake.

319
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,620
Oh my gosh, I look just like this monkey.

320
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,540
Oh, I'm scratching myself!

321
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,100
Eww!

322
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,360
Wait,

323
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:55,880
hold on.

324
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,660
I think I need to move.

325
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,010
Anybody coming in is gonna be like, where's the streamer at?

326
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,100
So talented.

327
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:11,840
Watch me do it fast.

328
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,400
Watch.

329
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:13,760
Watch.

330
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,260
Are you watching?

331
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,320
I can do it fast.

332
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:18,860
I can do it slow.

333
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,740
I'm a multi-talented monkey.

334
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,660
I'm not even paying attention.

335
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,400
Don't.

336
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:30,640
Don't.

337
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,760
Ice Monkey, no!

338
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,250
That wasn't supposed to happen.

339
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,910
Ice Monkey was supposed to remain pure.

340
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,850
He's not a killer.

341
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,470
Ice Monkey was never supposed to...

342
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,550
Oh, I'm kinda cut off.

343
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,890
Ice Monkey was never supposed to be a killer.

344
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,670
What have you done?

345
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,930
You've tainted Ice Monkey!

346
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,370
What have you done?

347
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:17,690
Anyway.

348
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,850
I'll stand right here.

349
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,650
You kinda can't see what I'm choosing, but that's okay too.

350
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,390
I'll just explain it with my words.

351
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,370
You enjoy all the monkeying around, don't you?

352
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,630
Let's make a sub...

353
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,910
What are you doing?

354
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,010
What are you doing?

355
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,610
What are you doing?

356
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,710
Okay.

357
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,050
You have permanently unlocked monkey upgrades.

358
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,090
No!

359
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,990
Wait, what is he talking about?

360
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,440
What are they talking about?

361
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,340
Huh?

362
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,200
I don't understand.

363
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,770
Tutorial jump scare.

364
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,890
Why did that happen?

365
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,310
I should probably start buying things.

366
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,640
Stand on the boat when it gets bigger?

367
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,420
Yeah!

368
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,080
Good idea!

369
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,200
I've never used a single knowledge point before.

370
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,500
Okay!

371
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:52,940
Uh...

372
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,780
Uh...

373
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,620
Uh....

374
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,220
Tanjiro!

375
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:58,920
Tanjiro!

376
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,900
Most delicious!

377
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,620
Thank you!

378
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,540
Thank you for not looting your phone!

379
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,180
Thank you!

380
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,880
Thank you so much!

381
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,880
I really appreciate it.

382
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,860
Um...

383
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,240
Also I had been leveling up my...

384
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,550
My...

385
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,400
My...

386
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:15,960
My...

387
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,380
My...

388
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:18,960
My plain monkey.

389
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,020
In fact we'll put him...

390
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,500
We'll put him in the общormos.

391
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,320
We'll throw him in too.

392
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,560
Put him in coach!

393
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,520
Put him in coach!

394
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,960
I'm gonna put him down here.

395
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,200
But then I'm gonna buy...

396
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,120
Nice.

397
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,880
More money please!

398
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:46,140
I should start... I should start doing farms too when I can.

399
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:56,500
And... I put the shadow because it's kind of hard to see me I feel.

400
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,680
Since I feel like my colors kind of blend in.

401
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,000
So my feet are kind of cut off too.

402
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,700
There we go.

403
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,020
So hopefully it's not too weird though.

404
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,020
It being there.

405
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,420
There we go.

406
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,060
It works well?

407
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:14,540
That's good.

408
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,180
Now she poops.

409
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,030
Proper ghost aura.

410
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,370
Hokey dokey.

411
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,010
Is that the Minto from Minto Gaming?

412
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,050
Freeze those blue!

413
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:38,590
No freeze!

414
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,510
He's

415
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,540
not allowed to kill.

416
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,240
He's not a killer.

417
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:45,920
He's not a killer.

418
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,600
This monkey has to stand all the way back here.

419
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,540
And juggle.

420
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,920
He's actually... he's actually the...

421
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,060
Oh!

422
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,720
A homeowner.

423
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,000
He owns this home.

424
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:56,540
Or!

425
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,540
He's the one manning...

426
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:58,900
No, no.

427
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,680
I like him better here.

428
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,920
He's the homeowner.

429
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,500
Good job Icemonkey.

430
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,620
Keep doing your work.

431
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,760
Keep doing the good work that you do.

432
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,840
I'm gonna do...

433
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,600
Double shock.

434
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,170
He's just chillin'.

435
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:21,430
Yeah.

436
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,110
Let him stay.

437
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:22,890
Let him stay.

438
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,090
Let him juggle.

439
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,790
And then I'm gonna do the rapid fire.

440
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:27,950
And then I'm gonna do the rapid fire.

441
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,670
As you see... As you see...

442
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:28,670
as you see...

443
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:32,570
As you can see, I have not touched the middle plane at all, but I'm...

444
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,170
Oh, I can unlock this one.

445
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,190
Oh my gosh, I'm so silly.

446
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,270
I didn't realize.

447
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,310
Nice.

448
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,450
And I can do some of these if I wanted to.

449
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,070
Very large bomb.

450
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,990
I made Ghost Oshie possess innocent ice monkey and turn him into a killer.

451
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,230
BTD6 Light Novel.

452
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,330
Plane's bottom path is the goal?

453
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:02,710
Oh yeah.

454
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,910
I've been doing this one, like, basically.

455
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,070
It's, like, exclusively.

456
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,670
That's why I have it unlocked first.

457
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:09,690
Because it's so good.

458
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,090
But I've never...

459
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:19,090
I haven't... I only did it recently, so I haven't had a chance to try out the most... With this today, we will see what the big plane is.

460
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:20,690
I'm excited.

461
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,070
I'm excited.

462
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,210
I'm so excited.

463
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,210
And then the honing one?

464
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,770
It's just so powerful.

465
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,630
It's such a good... It's a good monkey.

466
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,570
Look at her, though.

467
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,690
She's crap.

468
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:39,230
I wish there was a good place to put laser monkey here.

469
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,170
Gunner monkey?

470
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,230
Gunner monkey, my beloved.

471
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,350
This guy owns.

472
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,970
Maybe if I, like, stick him and have him go, like, up like that.

473
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,170
You think that will work?

474
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,050
If I put him, like, here and go...

475
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:57,850
Like that?

476
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,810
Projectile spam makes it look like a Danmaku game.

477
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,410
From one corner to the other diagonal?

478
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:11,670
Wait, what?

479
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:17,270
We could honestly have a gunner monkey on every...

480
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,150
We'll put him here.

481
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,530
We'll put him there.

482
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,050
Everywhere.

483
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,650
Anywhere that there's a bit of a straight line.

484
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,330
This one's the longest, though.

485
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,810
And it also reaches the most...

486
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,430
Okay, I think, like, here.

487
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,110
And then, just like...

488
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:38,840
Yeah!

489
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,460
Right?

490
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,000
That should work.

491
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,580
Just got home to watch the stream.

492
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,540
And at the best part, you place the ice monkey.

493
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,140
Ice monkey's gone!

494
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,580
Rip ice monkey.

495
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,440
Oh no, he's up here.

496
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,420
I forgot that I put him up there.

497
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,820
How you doing up there, ice monkey?

498
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,240
He's like, zero, zero, zero, just as you want it!

499
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,840
He's so right.

500
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,470
I hate this.

501
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,680
Yes.

502
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,640
After I can afford a farm.

503
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,360
Stop bad mouthing, ice monkey.

504
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,280
My bad.

505
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,640
Um, maybe I put him over here.

506
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,960
So typically, I like to put two and two next to each other.

507
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,000
And then, this guy in the middle.

508
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,580
So that he can generate more bananas.

509
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,440
Um, I do sometimes try to do three.

510
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,440
Like, I'll do...

511
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,840
This one, and then this one in the middle.

512
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,820
Because it'll collect the income radius.

513
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,420
And then this one on one... whatever side.

514
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,680
But, I don't think we have room for three.

515
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,920
And also him.

516
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,200
Okay, wait.

517
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,140
We can do one here.

518
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,940
One here.

519
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,320
Then maybe him here.

520
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:33,760
Maybe?

521
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,240
Hmm.

522
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,880
Bloons tensai.

523
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,960
I prefer banks when there's low space.

524
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,820
Are they smaller?

525
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,840
Is that why it's better?

526
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,620
What type of monkey is the box of bananas?

527
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,300
This one?

528
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,460
But I feel like this one... Okay, correct me if I'm wrong.

529
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,380
I feel like the top route is kind of inconvenient.

530
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,680
Well, until you get monkey wall street.

531
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,260
But also, I feel like... I feel like it just doesn't generate as much bananas as it costs.

532
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,600
Am I wrong?

533
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,180
I feel like there's...

534
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,000
Where is the goat?

535
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,100
Pat?

536
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,400
Fusty.

537
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,860
Top path is best income, but you have to collect it.

538
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,280
Oh really?

539
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,140
So it is actually?

540
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,540
See, but if you have this one, and then this one...

541
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,240
This will just collect it.

542
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,300
Everything in the radius.

543
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,260
So it's really awesome.

544
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,420
That's why you put it in the middle.

545
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,180
But...

546
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,000
But...

547
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,100
But...

548
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,020
But it's so inconvenient having this one.

549
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,080
They cost so much.

550
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:52,480
It's...

551
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,040
Both of them cost so much.

552
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,440
I mean, all three of them cost so much.

553
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:58,980
Hmm...

554
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:00,940
But...

555
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,330
Hmm...

556
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,110
Two banks then?

557
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,150
I like this one too though.

558
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,970
But I guess we don't need...

559
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,650
I like how it generates lives each round too.

560
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:20,230
I like how it generates lives each round too.

561
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,730
I like these two the most.

562
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,290
I'm gonna go with those two.

563
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,190
You guys, I'm a level 180 player.

564
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,410
Okay?

565
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,130
Please understand.

566
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,530
I have experience.

567
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,840
Let's get this one too.

568
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,180
We'll do the...

569
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,220
We'll do...

570
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,600
We'll do...

571
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,020
We'll do...

572
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,700
We'll do...

573
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,320
We'll do...

574
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,640
We'll do the bottom path first.

575
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,340
Because we're gonna have some merchantmen.

576
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,360
I love how well your TV model fits into the game.

577
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:05,840
It's too cute.

578
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,200
Don't miss any bloons now.

579
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,120
What if I... What if I stand and guard the exit instead?

580
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,360
What if I...

581
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:12,360
What if I stand and guard the exit instead?

582
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,720
Actually, I'm standing to the side because I'm like Sensei in Blue Archive.

583
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,540
Actually, I'm standing to the side because I'm like Sensei in Blue Archive.

584
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,100
I'm the Sensei to these monkeys.

585
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,740
I tell them what to do.

586
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,360
I tell them what to do.

587
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,520
The last line of defense is Mito.

588
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,560
That's cheating.

589
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,510
How so?

590
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,190
How so?

591
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,070
Moab.

592
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,370
How...

593
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,090
How do I live?

594
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:47,790
How do I live?

595
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,710
Guys, I don't know if we're gonna make it to 200 today.

596
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,410
Guys, I don't know if we're gonna make it to 200 today.

597
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,390
I mean in this round.

598
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,550
That's okay though.

599
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,810
Oh, another thing I've been trying to upgrade are my...

600
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,350
Oh, another thing I've been trying to upgrade are my...

601
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,450
Are these guys too.

602
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,650
Gran Saboteur.

603
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:09,310
Gran Saboteur.

604
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,670
They did not handle it.

605
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,690
Not at all.

606
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,990
I'll hold off on that.

607
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:19,290
I'll hold off on that.

608
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:24,590
Until we upgrade these ones.

609
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,550
Until we upgrade these ones.

610
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,030
I'll just hover for now.

611
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:29,450
I'll just hover for now.

612
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,350
Ice Monkey made you live.

613
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,310
You're so right.

614
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:33,830
You're so right.

615
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,450
Oh, and I gotta get this one too.

616
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:35,970
It's so good.

617
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,460
Almost.

618
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:42,700
Yippee!

619
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,500
Okay, now we should be good for a while.

620
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,920
Now we should actually be good for a while.

621
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,300
Oh my god.

622
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,460
They're flying everywhere.

623
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,780
There's just stuff all over the screen.

624
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,540
It's just a warm up round.

625
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,300
Yeah, exactly.

626
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:58,960
Exactly.

627
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:02,820
Hahaha.

628
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,760
Alright, I'm gonna change it to the marketplace.

629
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,260
Clear up any monkey... I mean bananas.

630
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,360
Alright.

631
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,480
Let's see.

632
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,240
Who do I want to throw into the ring next?

633
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,200
I'm gonna...

634
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,280
I might actually just add Druid Monkey.

635
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,100
I'm gonna put him up there.

636
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,840
You're probably like, why?

637
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
That's such a weird place.

638
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,060
First of all, the guy is gonna have range.

639
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,800
Because he's gonna have...

640
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,740
The Druid of the Jungle.

641
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,940
But also, I need him next to the banks.

642
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:36,900
Hahaha.

643
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,000
I need him next to the banks.

644
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,980
I mean to the...

645
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,540
Here we go.

646
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,780
Okay, now he's got that good old reach.

647
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:46,820
Why?

648
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,580
That's such a weird place.

649
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,400
I'm so glad you asked that Sage.

650
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:50,760
Hahaha.

651
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,180
Mei!

652
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,140
New Bloons DLC with Chibi Minto as new character?

653
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:58,980
Kawaii!

654
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,600
Hahaha.

655
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,880
I feel like though...

656
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Also, I feel like I would fit into Cookie Run Kingdom even more so.

657
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,500
What do you guys think?

658
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,040
I feel like I'd fit in Cookie Run even more.

659
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,080
Mint cookie.

660
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:21,540
Hahaha.

661
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,700
Mint chocolate cookie.

662
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,700
Oh my gosh.

663
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,240
Girl Scouts should collab with me.

664
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,520
I basically am the thin mint.

665
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,220
Hahaha.

666
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,860
Or maybe not the thin part.

667
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,520
Hahaha.

668
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:38,840
Hahaha.

669
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,350
I'm gonna save up for the laser cannon.

670
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:47,870
Thick mint.

671
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,750
Hahaha.

672
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,330
Nice.

673
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,270
Good job everybody.

674
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,430
Good job team.

675
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,110
I'm gonna add in another sub.

676
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,320
And another ship.

677
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,050
And another ship.

678
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:13,550
This ship...

679
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,770
This one will be middle.

680
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,510
Monkey pirate.

681
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,730
This one will be top.

682
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,450
He'll be the flagship.

683
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,590
The carrier.

684
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,870
Chibi Mint fits in any cutesy game.

685
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,630
Chibi Mint fits in any cutesy game.

686
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,690
Oh my gosh.

687
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,670
We won't die this time.

688
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,030
See?

689
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,290
We're all good.

690
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,930
This guy will be...

691
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:40,170
This guy will be...

692
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,330
The sub commander.

693
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,010
What's this one?

694
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:47,690
What's this one?

695
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,270
Which one should I do?

696
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,630
Allows long range targeting of balloons and radius of your other tower.

697
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:52,830
Allows long range targeting of balloons and radius of your other tower.

698
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,630
This one is so...

699
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,090
The advanced intel is so good, right?

700
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,150
024 glue gunner destroys with SATA.

701
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:58,430
Trust.

702
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,490
024 glue gunner...

703
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,070
Okay IDK.

704
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:01,970
Are you sure?

705
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,990
Because your name is IDK.

706
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,790
Do you really trust...

707
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,130
Should I trust someone who doesn't know?

708
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:11,530
Top path is stronger.

709
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,330
What for the sub?

710
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,450
I already have this...

711
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,470
Oh, wait this one?

712
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:15,830
The energizer?

713
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,470
I mean...

714
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,230
There you go.

715
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:18,970
Hahaha.

716
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,210
Don't worry guys.

717
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:21,790
We'll get to it.

718
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:23,870
IDK.

719
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:24,730
Seems a little size.

720
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,910
I'm gonna put him right here.

721
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,130
Next to her.

722
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,110
What was it?

723
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,150
024?

724
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,650
I actually usually do that one.

725
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,550
Actually...

726
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:39,410
That's usually the one that I go with.

727
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,490
Hey, why aren't you doing your job, idiot?

728
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,530
My bad.

729
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:48,550
My bad.

730
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,630
You were trying to do your job.

731
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:52,990
They were camos.

732
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,030
I knew that.

733
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,480
Nice.

734
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,440
What are we doing?

735
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:04,940
Oh, this one.

736
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,080
Read SATA.

737
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,620
Level 7 and 11 ability.

738
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:11,880
I don't read.

739
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,380
This cute TV model makes me want to grab it.

740
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,340
Like that hand grabbing the gerbil rat meme.

741
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,200
Don't grab me, please.

742
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,060
Don't grab me, please.

743
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,800
Maybe avoid grabbing the Minto.

744
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,220
Don't grab me, please.

745
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,720
With excessive force, okay?

746
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,600
Just saying.

747
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,280
I think you have a problem.

748
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,660
If you're like...

749
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,160
I know cuteness aggression is a thing.

750
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,100
But like...

751
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,120
I'm just saying.

752
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:50,760
I'm just saying.

753
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,700
I'm just saying.

754
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,190
I get so loud!

755
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,310
I get so loud!

756
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,710
I'm going to turn it down just a little bit more.

757
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,390
I don't know.

758
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,810
I thought about like...

759
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,190
merch like that.

760
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,590
That would be kind of fun, but I think...

761
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,690
I don't know.

762
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,090
I feel like cookies are pretty easy to ship, right?

763
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,150
Because they're like...

764
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:38,830
Because they don't really expire so quickly, so...

765
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,420
Get it!

766
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,660
Bloon.

767
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,200
That's right.

768
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:54,960
Bloon.

769
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,900
I got a good shelf life.

770
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,180
Yeah.

771
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,760
It might crumble during shipping.

772
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,500
That's true.

773
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,420
That's true.

774
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,380
But like...

775
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,040
If I ship them right, it should be fine.

776
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,350
Actually, I should have put this guy over here.

777
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,250
I should have put this guy up here.

778
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,970
Because then he'll reach even further.

779
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:33,870
I'm going to sell him.

780
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,330
Hahaha.

781
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,000
Nice.

782
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,520
Good job, everybody.

783
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,180
I'm going to also do our next farm.

784
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,020
Oh my gosh.

785
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,560
Will it fit?

786
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,160
How?

787
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:53,660
Why?

788
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,520
Oh!

789
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:54,920
Oh!

790
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,480
Wait.

791
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,380
Oh my god.

792
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,340
It's still in his range, right?

793
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,460
It's still in his range!

794
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,320
And this one will be a bank.

795
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,480
Oh.

796
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,290
Do they still have the helicopter monkey?

797
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,270
Or upgrade that...

798
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,410
Let's you move monkeys?

799
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,550
Or was that only in four?

800
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,470
Move...

801
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,250
Oh, I don't think so.

802
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:20,950
Is that a heli...

803
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,250
Is that a helicopter up there?

804
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:22,630
Or...

805
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,270
That's so nice.

806
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:25,790
What the heck?

807
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,220
Middle path.

808
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:31,860
Oh!

809
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,760
It's still a thing.

810
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,360
Oh, I don't think I have that one unlocked.

811
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,060
That's probably why.

812
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,340
I don't have it unlocked.

813
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,100
Maybe quite.

814
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:44,840
Thanks for the gift.

815
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:47,760
Okay.

816
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,640
Now I don't have to worry about it.

817
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,420
Let's see.

818
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,660
Where is my heli...

819
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,100
Oh, here.

820
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,440
Oh, wrong one.

821
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,540
Oh, wait.

822
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,300
See, I'm waiting to do this one.

823
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,440
I'm waiting to unlock this one.

824
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,000
But I'm quite far ways away to go.

825
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,500
Hmm.

826
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,880
Batman can move things too.

827
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,480
Wow.

828
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,280
The Chinook.

829
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,700
Blows back more bloons and gains abilities.

830
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,220
Drops lives and cash crates.

831
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,540
And can pick up and redeploy most monkey types.

832
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,520
Oh my god.

833
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:17,880
What?

834
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,480
Maybe I should unlock them.

835
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,840
Monkey marine!

836
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,560
It's worth?

837
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,060
I haven't been able to get this one either.

838
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,280
I just recently unlocked it.

839
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,180
Maybe I'll go with this one instead.

840
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:37,920
Okay.

841
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,760
Let's save up for a...

842
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,300
Let's save up for a...

843
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,500
Okay.

844
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,180
What's the word?

845
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:50,940
Helicopter monkey.

846
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,250
I need this guy all the way up too though.

847
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,010
Let's see, I'm gonna put it right...

848
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,630
Right next to...

849
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,450
Right next to plane monkey.

850
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,630
This is the airport everybody.

851
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,870
Forgot to use this almost at 3 months.

852
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,330
Thank you Elias!

853
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,030
Thank you!

854
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,270
Wait.

855
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,250
Welcome to Membu's ship but it was retracted.

856
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,110
Who was that?

857
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,390
This one.

858
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,210
Middle path.

859
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,030
But I like the pursuit so I don't have to do anything.

860
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,710
I feel like every path for the helicopter is pretty good.

861
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,070
They each have really good strengths.

862
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:46,750
If you don't have 1M on round 100ish, I'm leaving but seriously I hope you have a good trip.

863
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,030
1M!

864
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,550
I am 1Minto!

865
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,510
What are you talking about?

866
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,510
I literally have 1M right now.

867
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,530
I'm 1Minto.

868
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,780
I had 1Minto.

869
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,780
I had 1Minto from round 1.

870
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,080
From round 0.

871
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,740
It said most monkey types.

872
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,380
What can it not do?

873
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,460
One order of Minto please.

874
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,320
Hiya Minto.

875
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,260
Hiya Kenny.

876
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,020
Hey there Kenny.

877
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,690
I can't move Ice Monkey.

878
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,710
Oh, temples and air towers.

879
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,740
What does that mean?

880
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,980
What does that even mean?

881
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,180
Who am I teasing?

882
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,960
What's going on?

883
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,080
Are you winning me?

884
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,460
I have an extra life.

885
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,960
Wait, where did that...

886
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,840
I was at like 48.

887
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,380
Where did I get the extra ones from?

888
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,900
Oh, it's from the banana.

889
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,120
Oh.

890
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:24,520
Oh.

891
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:24,940
Laser.

892
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:25,580
Laser.

893
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:25,960
Laser.

894
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,220
Laser.

895
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,500
Four.

896
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,800
Five.

897
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,280
Six.

898
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:32,800
Seven.

899
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,440
Eight.

900
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,540
I love the lasers.

901
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:44,220
Can you please get the made monkey to negative 1.

902
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:44,740
Negative 1.

903
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,200
Negative 1.

904
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,660
Like intelligence or...

905
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,360
Oh, I forgot to...

906
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,160
Even more.

907
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,640
Stop appearing.

908
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,900
You little freak down there.

909
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,240
Kuma-sama.

910
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,840
Thank you for the gift.

911
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,320
Thank you.

912
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,860
Hi Minto.

913
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,200
Hello.

914
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:04,640
Jobob.

915
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,400
Alright.

916
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,800
Let's get an aircraft carrier up in here.

917
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,360
Let's get an aircraft carrier up in here.

918
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,680
We got little planes.

919
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,560
We got big planes.

920
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,700
We got helicopters.

921
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,500
We got planes everywhere.

922
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,060
We got planes in your brains.

923
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,100
Roton 1.

924
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,580
Thank you for the gift.

925
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,860
Oh, she caught me.

926
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,760
I sniped you.

927
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,400
Don't you know...

928
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,200
I have good vision.

929
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,040
Hi ice monkey.

930
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,720
Oh, hello there.

931
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,580
That's probably what ice monkey sounds like.

932
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,300
Kind of like a nerd.

933
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,620
86,000.

934
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,100
It's crazy.

935
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,460
Let's go for the first strike capability next.

936
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,780
So far so good though.

937
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,840
I say.

938
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,860
Until not.

939
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,020
Please upgrade ice monkey.

940
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,800
Must be your first time here.

941
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,440
Hahaha.

942
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,560
What am I looking for?

943
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,020
Oh, this one.

944
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:31,660
2000.

945
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:32,900
I'll take it.

946
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,620
We're close.

947
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,160
We're close.

948
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:44,960
Yes.

949
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,860
Oh, there we go.

950
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:46,840
Nice.

951
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,440
Oh, come on.

952
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,020
We're so close.

953
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,660
Look, we're almost at round 80.

954
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,620
I really need to get this guy up too though.

955
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,100
I really need to get this guy up too though.

956
00:44:59,060 --> 00:44:59,700
I do.

957
00:44:59,740 --> 00:44:59,980
I do.

958
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,880
So he can start giving me more money and more lives.

959
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:03,460
Pizza!

960
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,240
Welcome to membership.

961
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:05,760
Thank you.

962
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:09,660
Ding.

963
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,980
The game your dad played.

964
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,340
The admiral sea battles.

965
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,800
Uh oh.

966
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,820
Uh oh.

967
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,060
That was so close.

968
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,120
It's not on same and it is obscure.

969
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,880
I don't think the game my dad played is obscure.

970
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,560
But let me see.

971
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,840
Admiral sea battles.

972
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:46,870
I think it...

973
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:50,070
I think so!

974
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:51,550
Wait a second.

975
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:53,550
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

976
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:54,010
Maybe not.

977
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:55,450
But it looks very similar.

978
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:57,230
It looks really, really similar.

979
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:58,810
There was one thing about the game.

980
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,010
You could go to the towns and stuff.

981
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:03,390
You could like dock on the ports and like go into town.

982
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,270
So it wasn't always on the sea.

983
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:07,850
But like the picture frames look so familiar.

984
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:09,390
Oh my god.

985
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,370
I don't think it is though.

986
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:12,350
I don't think it is though.

987
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,490
It looks so familiar at first.

988
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:16,970
Oh my gosh.

989
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:18,970
It looks so similar.

990
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:22,270
Almost found it.

991
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:22,670
Almost.

992
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:23,690
Almost.

993
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:24,810
I almost nailed it.

994
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:25,290
You really did.

995
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:26,730
Thank you though, Kevi.

996
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:29,530
Thank you.

997
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:31,470
So close.

998
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:38,490
I like how we'd be beaming up the...

999
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,410
I wonder if it's like...

1000
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,470
Why can't he be here?

1001
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,370
This is so messed up.

1002
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:43,330
Like not even here.

1003
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:47,770
I wonder if the farm was here though.

1004
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:49,790
If this would still gobble it up.

1005
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:54,210
I'm gonna also get maybe some wizard monkeys.

1006
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:57,210
I feel like we need something in here, right?

1007
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:01,780
Hmm...

1008
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:06,110
Magic monkeys.

1009
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,110
Yeah.

1010
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,790
I'm trying to also get them up.

1011
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:10,750
So I can unlock this thing.

1012
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:15,170
Something to remove camo.

1013
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:16,670
This one removes it, right?

1014
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,550
Well, it's only periodic...

1015
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:18,730
Wait.

1016
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:20,230
Periodically reveals.

1017
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:22,590
Oh, but permanently.

1018
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:24,830
But it's only periodically.

1019
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:27,450
Ah...

1020
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:28,970
Mem... Mem... Mem... Mem...

1021
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:30,650
Hmm...

1022
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:31,910
What do I want to add?

1023
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:35,530
But also, ninja monkeys will strip it, right?

1024
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:38,150
Oh, it can strip the camo.

1025
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:40,550
It doesn't mean it will entirely.

1026
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:47,710
Strong.

1027
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:49,770
We'll do first for that one.

1028
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:51,030
Strong.

1029
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:52,210
First.

1030
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:53,910
First.

1031
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:00,830
Sticky bomb?

1032
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,910
You're a buccaneer for DDTs.

1033
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:04,110
Like...

1034
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:06,010
This is the buccaneer.

1035
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:06,190
Right?

1036
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:07,210
Um...

1037
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:09,030
What?

1038
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:09,610
Nope.

1039
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:12,450
This one.

1040
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:13,270
Sticky bomb?

1041
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:13,810
Okay.

1042
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:16,270
Probably good to have though, right?

1043
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:20,250
Good.

1044
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:22,190
Because they can also attack the...

1045
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:22,850
What's it called?

1046
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:29,710
Um...

1047
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:30,730
The camo bloons.

1048
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:31,130
It's good.

1049
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:36,520
There we go.

1050
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:39,820
Yeah.

1051
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,240
Throw your little bombs.

1052
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,540
Throw your little bombs.

1053
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,160
Throw your little bombs.

1054
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:44,560
But...

1055
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:46,660
Hmm...

1056
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:47,660
And then I do...

1057
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:48,460
I'll do this one.

1058
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:49,840
There we go.

1059
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,300
That should be good.

1060
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,580
Oh my god.

1061
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,640
0 to 5.

1062
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:54,820
That's what I did.

1063
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,300
Maybe I'm getting better at this game.

1064
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:01,860
Oh!

1065
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:02,700
We did it!

1066
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:03,220
Yippee!

1067
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,200
All right.

1068
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:04,760
Free play time.

1069
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,080
Let's keep going.

1070
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,180
You guys.

1071
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,600
We're almost to 100.

1072
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,300
Which means we're almost halfway to 200.

1073
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,140
Okay.

1074
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:14,600
Let's go.

1075
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:17,580
I really want to get this.

1076
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:17,720
Oh!

1077
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,900
I really want to get this guy up.

1078
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,720
I like him being up so much.

1079
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,220
Hmm...

1080
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:28,820
43!

1081
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,240
We have quite a few though that...

1082
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,780
We just got to keep saving money.

1083
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,800
Chopper upgrade.

1084
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,240
Oh yeah.

1085
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:40,640
Thank you.

1086
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,380
It's so hefty!

1087
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,820
Wait, what does the ability do?

1088
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,260
Oh, wait.

1089
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,820
Blows back many more bloons and gains abilities.

1090
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,500
Drops lives and cash crates.

1091
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,260
I don't want to... will it always pick them up though?

1092
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,040
It drops money and lives.

1093
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:02,460
Oh!

1094
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:03,720
Oh!

1095
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,590
Oh, here's the cash one!

1096
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:15,490
Okay, I see it.

1097
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:16,630
I missed it before.

1098
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,100
Here it comes.

1099
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,340
Oh, here it comes!

1100
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,240
Oh, we got it!

1101
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,920
We're slowly but surely getting back to 100.

1102
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,020
With sound on, the Oompa Loompa monkeys play music.

1103
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:50,850
What sound?

1104
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:52,030
Oh, this?

1105
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:53,670
Yes?

1106
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:53,970
Yes?

1107
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:54,610
Yes?

1108
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:57,310
Yes?

1109
00:50:58,650 --> 00:50:59,310
Yes?

1110
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:00,410
Yes?

1111
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:00,950
Wait, why is it...

1112
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:01,450
Yes?

1113
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:02,370
Yes?

1114
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:03,670
Yes?

1115
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:05,290
Yes?

1116
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:09,330
Why isn't he speaking anymore?

1117
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:11,770
Quincy!

1118
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,190
Where are you?

1119
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:21,330
It's because I silenced him for too long.

1120
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,650
It means no.

1121
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:27,530
No, I won't take no as an answer!

1122
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:30,230
Quincy, Quincy, are you here?

1123
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:31,830
Oh boy, thanks for the gift!

1124
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,110
Quincy, Quincy, speak to me!

1125
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:35,890
Quincy!

1126
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,220
I heard it.

1127
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,700
I heard him in the... yes?

1128
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:46,640
Quincy!

1129
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,100
Quincy, speak to me!

1130
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,300
Hold on, you guys, I'm gonna get the Ouija board.

1131
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,340
I'm gonna get the Ouija board.

1132
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,600
Quincy, are you here?

1133
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:13,360
Quincy, if you're here, give us a sign!

1134
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,920
Quincy, give us a sign!

1135
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,960
Bunny, welcome to membership, thank you!

1136
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,420
Sorry, it's a really tumultuous time right now.

1137
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,180
I don't think Quincy's here.

1138
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:27,540
Quincy!

1139
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:28,760
Quincy, are you here?

1140
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,220
Quincy, are you alive?

1141
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:36,560
Yes?

1142
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,100
Oh my gosh,

1143
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,040
the Ouija board always works!

1144
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,080
Have you guys ever tried calling me on the Ouija board before?

1145
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,360
Rico Mortis has sent in...

1146
00:52:59,360 --> 00:52:59,860
No, no, no!

1147
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,480
I'm a ghost!

1148
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,360
Return to your ancestors.

1149
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,820
I don't want to hear you anyway.

1150
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,780
It's because... not yet?

1151
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,360
Every day?

1152
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,460
You don't know my number!

1153
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,820
You don't know my number, silly!

1154
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,900
You're not gonna know how to contact me!

1155
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,200
You're gonna get some random ghosts!

1156
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,480
That's bad!

1157
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,800
Don't just call people!

1158
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,760
Don't just call random people!

1159
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,540
Oh my gosh, we're so close!

1160
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,820
I just realized how much money we have!

1161
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:31,780
We're doing alright!

1162
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:32,380
We're doing alright!

1163
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,640
When did the DDT start coming in?

1164
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,000
I'm scared.

1165
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,960
When did we get the DDTs?

1166
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:51,960
So close.

1167
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:53,740
Around 90.

1168
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,440
Okay, okay.

1169
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,100
Soon then soon.

1170
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,140
Is your number 44444444?

1171
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,440
No!

1172
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:19,500
A really dumb number to have if you're a ghost!

1173
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,220
Because it's so obvious!

1174
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,240
If it's... I mean...

1175
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:28,660
What?

1176
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:03,470
Well, I was.

1177
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:05,030
Or actually, I don't know.

1178
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,630
What is a ghost anyway?

1179
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:11,130
Here he comes.

1180
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:14,410
Oh my gosh, he looks just like the guys from Outer Wilds!

1181
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:25,090
Thank you for the 44444.

1182
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:26,270
Appreciate it.

1183
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:36,930
I think because I'm a ghost, whatever the gen is, I am that, I think.

1184
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:39,050
Be right back.

1185
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:40,510
Gonna call this ghost number I saw.

1186
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:41,930
No real reason.

1187
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:45,770
So wait, what is it now?

1188
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:46,530
Gen...

1189
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:49,150
Alpha?

1190
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,200
Gen Alpha, yeah.

1191
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,060
Join us, Zoomers.

1192
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,240
You guys are old now.

1193
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,260
Zoomers are old now.

1194
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,560
It's all about the Alpha, baby.

1195
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,160
Oh no, I forgot that I don't have this unlocked.

1196
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,240
Oh gosh.

1197
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,680
That's okay though.

1198
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:26,900
Which one should...

1199
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,240
Wow!

1200
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,060
Oh my gosh, that was so close.

1201
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,440
That was close.

1202
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,020
Let's see.

1203
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,220
What should I save up for?

1204
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,040
Guys, this Mint will have two number 9s.

1205
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,020
Number 9...

1206
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,280
Large...

1207
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,340
I don't have my piece of paper today.

1208
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,380
Also, you have the wrong number!

1209
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,180
Mint was here when the Declaration of Independence was news.

1210
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,220
I stole the Declaration of Independence.

1211
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,300
You guys might not know, but I'm in that movie.

1212
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,120
I'm Nicolas Cage.

1213
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,480
I'm a millennial and I prefer phone calls.

1214
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:12,760
Texts can be ignored, but the ringing, ringing, ringing will never stop.

1215
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,040
Today, I went to go pick up some food.

1216
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:21,780
I didn't realize they were calling me, but I was driving.

1217
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,120
I was pulling into the parking lot and they were calling me.

1218
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:27,420
And I was like...

1219
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,960
I was like, I have no number calling me.

1220
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,720
I'm not going to answer.

1221
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,260
I always Google the numbers, you know?

1222
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,260
Before I pick up.

1223
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,200
And I Googled it and it was the restaurant.

1224
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,040
And I was like...

1225
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,800
But I was like, I had already parked.

1226
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:44,440
So I was like, if they need me for something, I'll just go inside and I'll see...

1227
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,360
I'll see why they're calling me.

1228
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,120
And when I went inside...

1229
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,020
Oh my gosh, it was like a bunch of teenage girls.

1230
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,180
And they were just like...

1231
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,480
Why did she pick up?

1232
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,320
I kept calling and calling.

1233
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,960
They called me twice.

1234
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:59,720
First of all, but I was driving.

1235
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,960
And also, I was like...

1236
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,560
This is so awkward.

1237
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,240
I could never go there again, you guys.

1238
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,980
I can never go there again.

1239
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,300
They were like...

1240
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,280
Who are you?

1241
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,820
Or what do you want?

1242
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,200
Or rather, they were like...

1243
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:20,940
What do you want to order?

1244
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:21,860
And I was like...

1245
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,220
I'm picking up.

1246
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:23,900
And they were like...

1247
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,400
What's the name?

1248
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,720
And I was like...

1249
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,240
Minto?

1250
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:27,760
And they were like...

1251
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,780
And they looked at each other and they started giggling.

1252
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:31,660
And they were like...

1253
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,100
We tried calling you.

1254
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:33,860
And I was like...

1255
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:34,360
I was...

1256
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,240
I was driving!

1257
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,660
I can't go there anymore.

1258
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:47,700
I can't go...

1259
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:48,140
I can't...

1260
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:48,720
I can't...

1261
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,820
I can't go there anymore, you guys.

1262
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,460
Holy cow, it gives you a lot of lives.

1263
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,100
Nice.

1264
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,440
Sopping wet cat energy, Minto.

1265
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,700
Please help, the ants are descending on my apartment.

1266
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,240
What?

1267
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,560
Call an exterminator!

1268
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,000
Ants...

1269
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,760
I once had a sugar ant problem.

1270
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:20,580
When I was a kid.

1271
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,560
I caused it.

1272
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,140
We...

1273
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:26,920
We...

1274
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:27,460
My...

1275
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:27,980
I was...

1276
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,280
I was gifted some...

1277
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:29,720
Like...

1278
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,200
Some sugar candies.

1279
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,100
Well, I guess candy...

1280
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:33,720
It was...

1281
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,120
I don't remember.

1282
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,980
It was like some kind of...

1283
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:38,420
Like some kind of rice candy.

1284
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,340
And I really liked it.

1285
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:41,760
And...

1286
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,880
But I couldn't get it often because...

1287
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,240
It was from someone that would like travel.

1288
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:47,900
And...

1289
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,360
So I...

1290
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,280
Hoarded them.

1291
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:52,460
And...

1292
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:54,520
Then...

1293
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:00,710
And then we got sugar ants.

1294
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:02,490
It was my fault.

1295
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:03,790
My parents were really mad.

1296
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:04,790
They were like...

1297
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:05,870
Why don't you eat the candies?

1298
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:06,350
I was like...

1299
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:07,690
Guys, I'll never...

1300
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:08,930
Because...

1301
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:10,410
Because if I eat them...

1302
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:11,350
I won't be able to have them.

1303
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:11,750
And they're like...

1304
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:14,250
You can't have them anymore now because they're covered in sugar ants.

1305
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:19,150
I really messed up that one, you guys.

1306
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:19,830
I really...

1307
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:20,970
I really messed that up.

1308
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:26,840
I messed that one up.

1309
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,880
We made it.

1310
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:35,320
We lived.

1311
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:36,940
We lived.

1312
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:37,820
I feel like...

1313
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:37,980
Okay.

1314
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,080
Okay.

1315
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,700
We need to start getting some other stuff for the DDTs, right?

1316
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,340
You messed that one up, chief.

1317
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:46,960
I know.

1318
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:47,700
I know.

1319
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,240
I know.

1320
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,060
Oh, this one we can upgrade, though.

1321
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,240
And how much money do we...

1322
01:00:59,240 --> 01:00:59,280
Oh!

1323
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,260
I'll take that.

1324
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:01,020
Nice.

1325
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,380
Love how she even bounces just by speaking.

1326
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,660
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1327
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,920
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1328
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:09,000
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1329
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:09,180
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1330
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:09,980
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1331
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:10,000
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1332
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,780
It's useless if I still throw him here.

1333
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:11,000
Monkey town.

1334
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:12,660
Ugh...

1335
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:17,770
On what, though?

1336
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:20,630
Hmm...

1337
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:21,710
On everybody?

1338
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:23,010
Everybody gets...

1339
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:24,130
You get monkey-towned!

1340
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:25,950
You get monkey-towned.

1341
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:27,230
You get monkey-towned.

1342
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:32,810
Gotta make a move to a town that's ripe for me.

1343
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:38,610
Simba!

1344
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:40,270
Thank you for that.

1345
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,070
Thank you for the 15 gift cards.

1346
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:43,110
Thank you.

1347
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:44,830
Thank you so much.

1348
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:52,490
Thank you so much.

1349
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:53,810
Appreciate it.

1350
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:01,550
Let's see.

1351
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:03,770
Maybe monkey town here.

1352
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:08,850
If I expand the radius, how far will it go?

1353
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:10,950
Oh.

1354
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:12,930
Oh!

1355
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:17,310
I could have used your ability.

1356
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:18,430
No!

1357
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:22,900
Okay, hold on.

1358
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:34,330
Thanks for the five gifted.

1359
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:34,850
Thank you!

1360
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:51,050
Big play.

1361
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,330
We are so close.

1362
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:54,070
We are so close.

1363
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,010
Well, I mean...

1364
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:57,230
Yes, but also so far.

1365
01:02:58,350 --> 01:02:59,770
I think... I don't know.

1366
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:03,010
I think I might upgrade laser before I upgrade big play.

1367
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:04,730
Maybe.

1368
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:05,230
I don't know.

1369
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:06,730
Maybe I should just go for the big play.

1370
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:10,250
Apache Dart Ship.

1371
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:11,390
I like that one a lot.

1372
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:14,390
I did go for this one, but maybe I will also do the Apache Dart Ship.

1373
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:17,770
Because that's the one that I have completely upgraded.

1374
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,740
Is someone asking about what Ice Monkey is doing up there?

1375
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,140
Yeah, he's providing entertainment.

1376
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:39,720
Heisei!

1377
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:41,920
Thank you for the five gifted!

1378
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:42,940
Thank you!

1379
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:44,280
Oh my gosh.

1380
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:44,980
Thank you so much!

1381
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:46,360
What's going on?

1382
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:47,000
Why?

1383
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:47,820
What's happening?

1384
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,480
Why are there so many of the gifted?

1385
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:50,260
Why?

1386
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,560
Go on the helipad?

1387
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,860
He's going to land on top of me.

1388
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,040
I'm going to get crushed.

1389
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:02,840
I'm going to literally die.

1390
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:03,880
Again.

1391
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:07,980
You know what?

1392
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:11,840
Let's just try it.

1393
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:17,630
Even though I'm scared.

1394
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:21,370
Actually, hold on.

1395
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:25,590
If I put it here... See, why can't...

1396
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:26,230
Oh my gosh.

1397
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:28,310
Wait!

1398
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:30,190
Wait!

1399
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:31,710
I haven't set it down yet!

1400
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:36,920
Guys, this is not good.

1401
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,220
This is not good.

1402
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,440
This is not good.

1403
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:42,780
I don't

1404
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,100
even know if this works.

1405
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,280
Oh!

1406
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:53,680
This is good.

1407
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:00,040
I know what I should add.

1408
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:01,740
I should add in some...

1409
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:03,980
Sniper Monkeys.

1410
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,030
I'm going to put them here.

1411
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:10,790
Because what I'm going to do...

1412
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:11,930
Is do this.

1413
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:13,970
There we go.

1414
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,240
And also, I would like...

1415
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,380
I'm trying to decide.

1416
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,900
Because I feel like I can put another monkey by the village.

1417
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,120
It'll be more worth it.

1418
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:43,760
Because this guy can do this.

1419
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:46,820
Like that.

1420
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,400
And make him super duper fast.

1421
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:49,520
Like that.

1422
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:51,940
I wanted to play monkeys along with you.

1423
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:54,740
But I'm stuck at work for like 24 hours.

1424
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:59,060
Owl, are you okay?

1425
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:02,600
Do you believe that love can balloon on the battlefield?

1426
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,080
I'm going to move myself.

1427
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,200
I don't like being over here.

1428
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:07,360
I feel lonely.

1429
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:10,580
I'm going to stay right here.

1430
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:16,550
Not so much.

1431
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,100
We can keep you company.

1432
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:27,660
Okay.

1433
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:29,860
You better.

1434
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,560
I'm holding you to that.

1435
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:35,240
I'm holding you to that.

1436
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:39,360
I don't know which one I want to upgrade first.

1437
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:41,240
Actually...

1438
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,380
There is the sub 2.

1439
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,800
I said I was going to add that sub guy.

1440
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:45,720
And I completely forgot.

1441
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:49,380
That one.

1442
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,320
There we go.

1443
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,240
This one is like...

1444
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,480
Oh my god.

1445
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,340
I didn't expect to see so many DDTs.

1446
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,500
Upgrade the bank.

1447
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:03,600
But it's like it's alone.

1448
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:05,980
I guess I'll take it.

1449
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:09,720
Oh!

1450
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:11,100
It's this guy.

1451
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:12,700
Oh my gosh.

1452
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:13,700
Wait.

1453
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:14,320
This one.

1454
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,080
Oh...

1455
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,460
I forgot about this guy.

1456
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:18,980
There we go.

1457
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:19,560
We're good.

1458
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:22,700
Yippee!

1459
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,700
Round 100.

1460
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,000
Easy.

1461
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:26,580
Mostly.

1462
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:28,920
Easy.

1463
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:29,700
Mostly.

1464
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:30,320
Baby.

1465
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,400
I'm going to upgrade this guy.

1466
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:38,000
What is this one doing?

1467
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:38,100
I don't know.

1468
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:38,140
Can I do it again?

1469
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:39,100
Yeah.

1470
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,380
I'm going to upgrade this one.

1471
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:42,060
Upgrade.

1472
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,320
Oh.

1473
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:44,760
That was it?

1474
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:57,420
Oh my gosh.

1475
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:59,000
Oh my gosh.

1476
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:00,780
But it's such a crazy amount of DDTs.

1477
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:01,760
It's really scary.

1478
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:03,920
Oh my god.

1479
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:05,440
Oh wait.

1480
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,160
There we go.

1481
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,460
Maybe that will help a little.

1482
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:10,400
Maybe that will help a little bit.

1483
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:14,860
Yeah!

1484
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:16,760
You know what?

1485
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:17,020
Also.

1486
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:17,740
Hold on.

1487
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:18,560
I know what.

1488
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,620
I know what one is really, really, really good to have.

1489
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,040
And that is...

1490
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:23,320
Hold on.

1491
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:23,780
Let me see.

1492
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:24,960
Uh...

1493
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:26,680
This guy...

1494
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:27,620
No, no, no.

1495
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:27,980
Just kidding.

1496
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:28,460
I'm a liar.

1497
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,700
This guy!

1498
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:30,640
This guy!

1499
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:31,180
This guy!

1500
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,500
He pushes all of them back.

1501
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:34,380
Today is my birthday!

1502
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:36,140
Can I get a Minty Fresh happy birthday song?

1503
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,320
Of course!

1504
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,260
Happy birthday to you.

1505
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:44,620
Happy birthday to you.

1506
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:47,840
Happy birthday dear Nathaniel.

1507
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:48,460
Happy birthday dear Nathaniel.

1508
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,680
Happy birthday to you!

1509
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:58,580
Happy birthday!

1510
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,220
So let's get in this guy.

1511
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,080
In fact, he should be good here because he'll just...

1512
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,580
I think he reaches across the whole map.

1513
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:09,200
He's crazy.

1514
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:19,700
And if he's within range of the town, maybe he'll...

1515
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:25,820
Maybe he'll be able to also do DDTs.

1516
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:27,180
I don't know.

1517
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,100
It might be a stretch, but...

1518
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:33,800
Okay.

1519
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,040
Now we save up.

1520
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,440
Whoa!

1521
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,020
My debt is gone!

1522
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,180
Yippee!

1523
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:48,940
I forgot about this guy too.

1524
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,840
Use IMF loan for more loans.

1525
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:58,700
Alright.

1526
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:02,080
I need more money, you guys.

1527
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:02,780
I need more money.

1528
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:09,420
Oh wait.

1529
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,460
I don't want to do the Monkey City.

1530
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,640
Which one is this again?

1531
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:16,640
Increases influence...

1532
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,420
No, I'm not yet.

1533
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,260
No, no.

1534
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:23,680
I think we're okay for now.

1535
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:24,600
I think we're okay for now.

1536
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,620
Rob your own bank.

1537
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:29,460
Bolts are great for money.

1538
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:29,900
You're right.

1539
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:30,640
You are right.

1540
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,380
Let's get ourselves a merchantman.

1541
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:38,430
I'm gonna keep him out of the range.

1542
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:40,070
Well, he doesn't need to be...

1543
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:41,510
Like, this is taking up a spot, right?

1544
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:42,730
Because he...

1545
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:45,510
He can...

1546
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:47,590
Do... guys.

1547
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:49,770
Let's do that.

1548
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:50,210
Whoa!

1549
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:51,190
He looks so cool!

1550
01:10:51,190 --> 01:10:52,630
I don't think I've ever seen this one before.

1551
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:54,870
More money!

1552
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:56,330
Yeah!

1553
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:00,960
Whoa!

1554
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:01,420
Nice.

1555
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:02,420
Oh my gosh.

1556
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,160
That strike worked so well.

1557
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,640
It worked so well.

1558
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:11,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1559
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1560
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:19,400
Oh my gosh.

1561
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:21,700
Do I hate these wands?

1562
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:22,860
Oh my gosh.

1563
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:23,620
I hate them so much.

1564
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:24,600
Woof.

1565
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:25,820
Woof, woof, woof.

1566
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:28,140
Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.

1567
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:34,510
108.

1568
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:42,990
It is chaotic.

1569
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:45,150
It's absolutely chaotic.

1570
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:46,470
It's chaos everywhere.

1571
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:48,410
It's chaos everywhere.

1572
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:49,350
Oh my gosh.

1573
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:51,570
Jam, thanks for the five gifted!

1574
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:52,510
Thank you!

1575
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,560
Oh, nice.

1576
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,820
I'm gonna upgrade with...

1577
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:02,320
You.

1578
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:03,760
Wow!

1579
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:04,500
He's huge!

1580
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,100
This poor sub.

1581
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:08,960
Okay.

1582
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:29,770
Easy.

1583
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:32,430
I gotta upgrade this guy too.

1584
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:37,890
But I think maybe Superstorm is our priority.

1585
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:38,930
Or...

1586
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:41,150
Like...

1587
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:41,850
You know.

1588
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:42,950
This guy too.

1589
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:43,530
I don't know.

1590
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:44,050
There's so many!

1591
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:45,110
There's so many!

1592
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:46,730
So many upgrades.

1593
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:47,430
So little time.

1594
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:48,910
And money.

1595
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:50,310
So little money mostly.

1596
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:51,010
Hahaha.

1597
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:53,070
Silver Empress, thanks for the five gifted!

1598
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:57,110
Tac shooters.

1599
01:12:57,430 --> 01:12:59,630
See, the thing about my tac shooters is...

1600
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:01,230
This is one, right?

1601
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:03,330
I haven't upgraded them very much.

1602
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:04,330
So it's kind of like...

1603
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:05,270
Not great to have them.

1604
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:06,250
But...

1605
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:09,910
Can I fit more than one?

1606
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:15,770
It won't be like a circle of them, but...

1607
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:23,430
Only one.

1608
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:25,430
No!

1609
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:31,140
So sad.

1610
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:37,510
Have you played around with the Beast Handler?

1611
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:39,870
Just a tiny, tiny bit.

1612
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:42,250
Not a super lot.

1613
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:44,890
But I love that there's dinosaurs.

1614
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:46,630
My favorite part.

1615
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:51,170
Can drag down ZOMGs?

1616
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:51,790
Jeez.

1617
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:54,810
Are they super good?

1618
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:56,350
The Beast Handler?

1619
01:13:57,710 --> 01:13:58,570
I don't know.

1620
01:13:58,570 --> 01:13:59,030
I don't know.

1621
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:01,570
What update did I miss?

1622
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:02,110
Hahaha.

1623
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:04,290
Welcome to Bloons 2024.

1624
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:07,850
Do I want to keep this guy?

1625
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,800
Yeah, I'll keep him.

1626
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:20,620
I'll keep him.

1627
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,380
I'll keep him.

1628
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:39,110
Ice Monkey?

1629
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:40,810
Monkey is carrying hard.

1630
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:42,330
Absolute...

1631
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:42,430
Oh!

1632
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:44,170
Absolutely he is.

1633
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:46,170
Of course he is.

1634
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:47,550
It's Ice Monkey.

1635
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:49,810
Look how cool she looks.

1636
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:53,090
I don't know if you guys noticed, but I got the skin.

1637
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:56,030
She looks so awesome.

1638
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:57,230
Max level.

1639
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:57,890
Look at her.

1640
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,750
She's got like an extra hand coming out.

1641
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:01,930
And she and I have the same sleeves.

1642
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:03,490
Yeah.

1643
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:04,530
She looks so cool.

1644
01:15:06,450 --> 01:15:08,190
Look how many things are flying around too.

1645
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:13,610
Maybe I should...

1646
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:14,590
Can it fit here?

1647
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:15,930
Now that I think about it.

1648
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:17,270
Uh...

1649
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:17,670
Nope.

1650
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:20,890
I was just going to put them there, but I don't think it'll fit.

1651
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:25,030
Jiangshi Sada is the GOAT.

1652
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:25,310
I know.

1653
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:26,070
She's so cool.

1654
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:29,430
She looks like that Darkstalker's character.

1655
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:30,110
Hahaha.

1656
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:32,090
I know who you're talking about.

1657
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:39,150
I think that's just the aesthetic of like Jiangshi though.

1658
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:39,610
Right?

1659
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:51,190
Hmm.

1660
01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:52,290
Sorry.

1661
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:52,710
Hold on.

1662
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:54,250
No.

1663
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:54,970
I'm going to save...

1664
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:56,150
I think I'm going to keep saving up.

1665
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:56,890
A little bit.

1666
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:58,650
Because this is really good.

1667
01:15:58,850 --> 01:15:59,570
The Superstorm.

1668
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:00,190
I'm telling you.

1669
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:01,310
It's...

1670
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:04,010
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1671
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:05,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1672
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:06,610
Okay.

1673
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:06,990
Oh.

1674
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:07,650
Oh.

1675
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:08,250
We made it through.

1676
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:08,690
Oh.

1677
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:09,110
Hahaha.

1678
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:10,230
Oh.

1679
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:11,690
I didn't know.

1680
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:11,950
Oh.

1681
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:12,570
That one was tough.

1682
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:15,330
I feel like I should also upgrade this though.

1683
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:15,750
But no.

1684
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:16,030
No.

1685
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:16,410
No.

1686
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:16,590
No.

1687
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:17,070
It's okay.

1688
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:18,710
Oh.

1689
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:19,570
But I also want to...

1690
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:19,930
No.

1691
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:20,470
No.

1692
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:21,190
It's fine.

1693
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:22,370
It's fine.

1694
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:31,380
I can still do this.

1695
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:31,960
113.

1696
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:34,840
That's right.

1697
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,340
You can put the monkeys on the helipad.

1698
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:37,740
I completely forgot.

1699
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:38,820
Thank you for telling me.

1700
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:39,480
These ones.

1701
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:39,900
Yes!

1702
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:42,560
I completely forgot about that.

1703
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,140
Who should we put?

1704
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,300
We can put Sniper Monkeys.

1705
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:48,320
How are you doing down here, Ninja Monkey?

1706
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:48,820
Are you okay?

1707
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,080
I can put another Ninja Monkey.

1708
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:53,660
Maybe like a Grandmaster Ninja Monkey.

1709
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:55,940
An Ice Monkey.

1710
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:56,580
Haha.

1711
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:58,240
Is he going to do it?

1712
01:16:59,140 --> 01:16:59,700
Alchemist?

1713
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,560
Oh, so he can start throwing things to people?

1714
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:04,760
Might be good actually.

1715
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,340
Because he throws...

1716
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,000
Right?

1717
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,440
The Berserker Brule.

1718
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,520
Giving extra damage, range and attack speed.

1719
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,300
I think that would be good.

1720
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,540
Throw the Ice Monkey.

1721
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,380
We have Ice Monkey!

1722
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:24,560
You have Ice Monkey!

1723
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:26,200
Oh, wait.

1724
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,280
I don't want to use all my money.

1725
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:29,720
You know what?

1726
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:30,900
I can just go into DEAD!

1727
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,860
I CAN GO INTO DEAD!

1728
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:43,650
Hey, are you not throwing anything?

1729
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:44,650
Or what are you doing?

1730
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:46,150
What are you doing, guy?

1731
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:47,010
You're not throwing anything.

1732
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:52,640
Yeah, they're not affected.

1733
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:04,530
He buffs the other towers.

1734
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:05,830
Yeah, but don't they have...

1735
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:06,090
See?

1736
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:08,270
He has a buff.

1737
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:10,130
But this guy doesn't have a buff.

1738
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:11,530
Even though he's in his range.

1739
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:14,270
This one doesn't have a buff.

1740
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:16,330
Do the planes get buffs?

1741
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:20,310
The buffs are not permanent.

1742
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:22,170
Let's see if it shows up.

1743
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:27,250
I guess he had the buff.

1744
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:28,550
And then he lost the buff.

1745
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:31,530
Throw faster!

1746
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:37,930
Throw faster, potion man!

1747
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:39,490
What are you doing?

1748
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:42,770
Oh, it only shows during the round?

1749
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:43,870
No, that's not true at all!

1750
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:45,230
Because... what does this mean then?

1751
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:46,890
Anyway.

1752
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:48,010
You know what?

1753
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:49,430
I don't know anything.

1754
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:50,930
I don't know anything about this game.

1755
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:53,010
I don't know why I act like a genius.

1756
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:57,030
Burn noises.

1757
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:02,910
I'm just going to go into more DEAD.

1758
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:04,130
I'm going to go into more DEAD.

1759
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:05,690
Everybody, we're so close.

1760
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:08,590
I'll feel more safe when we have the super storm.

1761
01:19:09,790 --> 01:19:11,730
I know I should upgrade Pirate Lord.

1762
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:14,210
But...

1763
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:22,360
It's fine.

1764
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:27,000
Oh my god!

1765
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:27,720
Oh my god!

1766
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,540
They're so crazy!

1767
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:32,660
Calm down!

1768
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:34,040
Chill out.

1769
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:34,820
Chill out.

1770
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,140
I'm going to give this guy that.

1771
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:45,460
Uh oh!

1772
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:46,000
Uh oh!

1773
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:47,280
Cha!

1774
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:53,840
Kiwawa!

1775
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,020
Kiwawa!

1776
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:56,160
Kiwawa!

1777
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,160
Oh, I didn't even use that.

1778
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:58,500
Wow!

1779
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,660
The storm is brewing.

1780
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,200
Flying fortress is a good one.

1781
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:04,720
What's that one?

1782
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:06,920
What's flying fortress?

1783
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,900
Oh, also we have this one I want to save up for today.

1784
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:16,200
Two!

1785
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,480
I'm telling you, once we get the ray of doom, it's crazy.

1786
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,780
Alright, I'm just going to go for it.

1787
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:26,640
I'm just going to...

1788
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:27,140
Oh no!

1789
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:27,940
No!

1790
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:28,440
No!

1791
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:29,820
Oh no!

1792
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:30,260
No!

1793
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:30,700
No!

1794
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,020
There's two of them!

1795
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:35,840
There's three of them!

1796
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:43,420
That was a bad surprise.

1797
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:48,450
Oh my god!

1798
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:49,030
Oh my god!

1799
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:49,670
Oh my god!

1800
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:50,570
Oh my god!

1801
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:51,690
Oh my god!

1802
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:56,130
I'm kind of going to die.

1803
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:57,130
Here we go.

1804
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:01,340
See?

1805
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:02,340
It pushes them back!

1806
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,420
It's so awesome!

1807
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:06,220
See?

1808
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:07,120
See?

1809
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:08,720
Oh, it feels so good!

1810
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:08,980
Yeah!

1811
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,760
Get back to the beginning, you dummies!

1812
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:13,500
Woo!

1813
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:18,250
Nice, nice.

1814
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:22,790
What am I looking at?

1815
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:23,690
Monkey!

1816
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:29,990
Yeah, it's so...

1817
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:30,570
It's so...

1818
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:32,310
It's so strong, I'm telling you.

1819
01:21:34,150 --> 01:21:34,730
Now... Oh!

1820
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:36,330
Collect my money.

1821
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:38,450
I'm in debt.

1822
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:41,730
Okay, now we can start upgrading some of these other guys that...

1823
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:43,910
probably have needed it for a while.

1824
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:50,570
But he's just blowing them back.

1825
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:51,290
He's like...

1826
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:53,370
He's like, get to the...

1827
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:54,630
Get to the front of the line!

1828
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:56,750
Get to the front of the line!

1829
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:04,400
I was also thinking maybe...

1830
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,000
I was also thinking maybe...

1831
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,600
I haven't put in a bomb yet.

1832
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:10,740
Like in a bomb blitz or a moab eliminator.

1833
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:13,320
Might be good or something.

1834
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:18,800
No paragon, you crazy.

1835
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:23,040
I want a paragon.

1836
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:37,480
Oh yeah!

1837
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:38,220
The big plane!

1838
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,940
It's a lot of money though.

1839
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,240
I feel like...

1840
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,100
Yes, I will invest.

1841
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:47,060
But...

1842
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:49,700
Or rather, I'll save up.

1843
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,100
But I should get some of these guys higher.

1844
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,660
So we feel a little more comfortable.

1845
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:55,800
Oh!

1846
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,580
Wait, it's a 5-5-5 tower.

1847
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:01,740
5...

1848
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:02,500
5...

1849
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,580
Wait, you can do that?

1850
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:05,620
Wait, is it like...

1851
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,720
Wait, no, not you.

1852
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:09,920
No?

1853
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:10,600
Wait, just kidding.

1854
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:11,460
Is it like...

1855
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:12,500
Is it like this guy?

1856
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:13,420
Is this the paragon?

1857
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,180
This thing?

1858
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:26,230
I mean, look how much...

1859
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:28,310
Guys, I can barely get to 100,000.

1860
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:30,250
How the hell would I even afford this?

1861
01:23:31,730 --> 01:23:33,170
How would I even afford this?

1862
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:38,730
My monkey economy is not really thriving, okay?

1863
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:41,270
We're in struggling times right now.

1864
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:46,070
Let's go into debt!

1865
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:47,090
Yeah!

1866
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:51,810
There's been times though that I've had a lot of monkey money.

1867
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:55,150
I think it was the one game that I got to 183 at.

1868
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:57,530
I think it was the one game that I got to 183 at.

1869
01:23:57,530 --> 01:23:58,610
Half the screen is farms.

1870
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:01,030
Farms do all the damage.

1871
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:05,710
As the bloons go by, it takes their money and it makes them sad and then they pop.

1872
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:08,490
It's really tragic.

1873
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:10,870
Anyway...

1874
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:14,230
I don't think there's much I can do anyway.

1875
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:14,830
I don't think there's much I can do anyway.

1876
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:17,410
Guys, I'm sorry!

1877
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:18,750
Let me let her out.

1878
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:20,190
Let me let my cat out real quick.

1879
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:21,650
I thought she was part of the music.

1880
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:23,450
Let me let you out, baby girl.

1881
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:45,340
Okay.

1882
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:45,720
Alrighty.

1883
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:49,040
It might be stupid to do this, but...

1884
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:53,020
See?

1885
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:54,080
He's blowing them away.

1886
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:55,460
So good.

1887
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:01,040
Just keep on blowing!

1888
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:01,380
Keep on blowing!

1889
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:12,030
Buy a couple more pirate trade ships, maybe?

1890
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:13,690
Yeah...

1891
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:16,550
You're probably right.

1892
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:20,050
And this one, it'll also increase the...

1893
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:20,830
You know what?

1894
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:22,430
This will be a row of pirate ships.

1895
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:23,290
Or...

1896
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:24,550
Merchantmen.

1897
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:27,470
This is our money...

1898
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:29,090
Money row right here.

1899
01:25:29,170 --> 01:25:29,670
Money row.

1900
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:32,670
Oh.

1901
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:33,650
I'm out of money.

1902
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:36,370
There we go.

1903
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:40,430
Go!

1904
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:40,830
Go!

1905
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:40,990
Go!

1906
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:41,110
Go!

1907
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:41,650
Nice.

1908
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:44,210
They got lots of money.

1909
01:25:46,910 --> 01:25:47,470
Amen.

1910
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:47,930
Hello!

1911
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:51,250
How much

1912
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:55,720
do we have in the bank?

1913
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:57,140
Not so much.

1914
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:07,010
It's kind of OP, isn't it?

1915
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,620
It's kind of OP.

1916
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:14,920
This guy, I'm telling you.

1917
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,200
He's just like...

1918
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,660
You will not pass.

1919
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,120
That's literally what he says.

1920
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:49,130
Still haven't even upgraded this guy.

1921
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:51,150
I won't lie.

1922
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:52,950
I've only been watching Ice Monkey juggling.

1923
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:55,150
There he is.

1924
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:57,350
A little silly goofball.

1925
01:26:58,410 --> 01:26:59,710
Up there in the corner.

1926
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:01,830
Oop.

1927
01:27:04,210 --> 01:27:05,130
More dirt!

1928
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:16,870
Nah, he's pretty cute up there.

1929
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:19,370
He does a good job.

1930
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:23,030
Oh.

1931
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:33,810
126!

1932
01:27:34,610 --> 01:27:35,090
126!

1933
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:35,290
126!

1934
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:39,310
One day we'll use an Ice Monkey only map.

1935
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:39,850
One day we'll use an Ice Monkey only map.

1936
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:40,810
Will that make you guys feel better?

1937
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:49,280
DDT incoming.

1938
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:51,660
DDT taken care of.

1939
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:52,820
Yes.

1940
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:56,000
Okay, Ice Monkey only.

1941
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,080
How much is an Ice Monkey?

1942
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:57,880
540!

1943
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:05,300
Oh gosh.

1944
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:05,740
Oh gosh!

1945
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:15,540
I was scared for my...

1946
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,820
I was scared for my afterlife there.

1947
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:19,420
I was really...

1948
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:21,080
I was really terrified, you guys.

1949
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:26,660
That was dangerous.

1950
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:28,560
That was really dangerous.

1951
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:28,660
That was really dangerous.

1952
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,160
I wanna get the bad...

1953
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:33,640
I wanna get the

1954
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:40,910
bad...

1955
01:28:41,470 --> 01:28:43,630
Mortar Monkey to strip the reinforced moabs.

1956
01:28:43,790 --> 01:28:44,630
See, um...

1957
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:45,850
That's another thing.

1958
01:28:46,650 --> 01:28:49,310
I haven't really used the Mortar Monkey very much.

1959
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:50,050
So, um...

1960
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:54,760
I don't have it.

1961
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:55,800
I don't have it.

1962
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:58,180
Uh...

1963
01:28:59,120 --> 01:28:59,600
Yeah.

1964
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:01,920
So you know, it's just kinda...

1965
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,280
It's kinda tough.

1966
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:17,450
We can still use em though.

1967
01:29:19,330 --> 01:29:22,110
Camo Bloons pop dirt by flares lose their camouflage permanently.

1968
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:23,750
That's pretty cool.

1969
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:26,790
I see you can see I was working on it.

1970
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:29,790
I was working on it.

1971
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:32,390
Alright Mortar Monkey.

1972
01:29:33,430 --> 01:29:34,830
You're gonna go right next to...

1973
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:35,470
No... No.

1974
01:29:35,530 --> 01:29:36,350
You're gonna go over here.

1975
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:38,030
Uh... No.

1976
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:38,530
No.

1977
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:41,010
Ice Monkey doesn't need to have hearing...

1978
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:41,070
Dang it.

1979
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:42,890
Damage too, you know.

1980
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:44,250
We can put him right here.

1981
01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:46,490
No, no.

1982
01:29:46,610 --> 01:29:47,230
We'll put him right here.

1983
01:29:49,210 --> 01:29:50,090
Set target.

1984
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:52,790
Yeah, that should be fine.

1985
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:56,250
Thank you!

1986
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:57,950
Ice, ice, ice.

1987
01:29:58,410 --> 01:30:03,230
Thank you, Lindrotorelli.

1988
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:04,670
Thank you so much!

1989
01:30:08,110 --> 01:30:08,890
Signal flare!

1990
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:12,630
Hey, it doesn't hurt to have him, right?

1991
01:30:14,290 --> 01:30:17,050
Yeah, he sets off the fireworks, you guys.

1992
01:30:17,410 --> 01:30:18,270
It's his job.

1993
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:20,790
I'm in debt.

1994
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:22,610
I'm in debt.

1995
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:36,850
We're all good.

1996
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:38,990
This is the color of Ice Monkey.

1997
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:45,230
Please give him a friend.

1998
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:46,730
He prefers to be alone.

1999
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:49,710
This is his friend.

2000
01:30:50,830 --> 01:30:52,490
Actually, he's scoping out this house.

2001
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:53,570
So that he can rob it.

2002
01:30:54,610 --> 01:30:55,950
Ice Monkey is not a good guy.

2003
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:56,830
But it's okay.

2004
01:30:56,930 --> 01:30:58,710
We root for an anti-hero, you know.

2005
01:31:00,270 --> 01:31:00,850
Let's see.

2006
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:08,480
Thank

2007
01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:18,070
you!

2008
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:19,310
Hooray for debt!

2009
01:31:19,690 --> 01:31:19,910
Yippee!

2010
01:31:20,110 --> 01:31:20,590
Wait, no!

2011
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:21,770
No, yippee!

2012
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:30,570
Okay, there's DDTs, but we're still okay.

2013
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:32,750
Kind of.

2014
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:33,330
Oh gosh.

2015
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:34,010
Kind of.

2016
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:34,130
Yes.

2017
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:36,830
Reinforcement!

2018
01:31:40,850 --> 01:31:43,410
This is not the color of Ice Monkey.

2019
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:50,400
Thank you for the Aqua Super.

2020
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:52,840
Thank you!

2021
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:54,200
Thank you!

2022
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:54,640
Thank you!

2023
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:54,980
Thank you!

2024
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,120
Appreciate it.

2025
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:56,600
Thank you!

2026
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:04,140
There's also... Gosh, there's so many things that I want.

2027
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:06,520
There's so many things that I want.

2028
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:07,820
Usually, my Gatlin...

2029
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:10,280
I always call him the Gatlin Monkey.

2030
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:12,100
My... my... my...

2031
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:15,380
Gunner Monkey has like crazy number of kills.

2032
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:16,820
Like this...

2033
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:17,700
Four million...

2034
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:25,670
Thank you for the... Aqua Super, thank you!

2035
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:27,250
Thank you!

2036
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:32,210
Thank you so much.

2037
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:34,970
Yeah, my Gat... my Gat Monkey.

2038
01:32:35,910 --> 01:32:37,290
I should probably pay attention.

2039
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:40,230
I should probably be paying attention.

2040
01:32:40,670 --> 01:32:41,390
Look at this.

2041
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:42,690
Four million...

2042
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:45,170
Four million Monk...

2043
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:46,970
Bloons taken out.

2044
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:58,860
I wonder if I should put in...

2045
01:32:58,860 --> 01:32:59,740
Not Sniper Monkey.

2046
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,060
If I should... I mean...

2047
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:06,320
I recently unlocked the Sun Temple, but I'm too scared to use it.

2048
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:09,160
I'm too scared to use it.

2049
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:12,980
But maybe like a Sun Avatar.

2050
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:23,870
Super Monkey as a... as a treat.

2051
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:30,280
I guess... I think... I don't think it would hurt to have it.

2052
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,800
More than anything, you know what I mean?

2053
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:33,660
But I think maybe like here.

2054
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,660
Because I think we need more defenses on this end.

2055
01:33:40,690 --> 01:33:42,450
And I'm gonna epic range him.

2056
01:33:43,430 --> 01:33:43,830
Right?

2057
01:33:44,270 --> 01:33:45,270
That's what I usually do.

2058
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:45,750
Yeah.

2059
01:33:46,610 --> 01:33:48,990
He's... he's got... he's got the help of the...

2060
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:50,410
Yeah, there we go.

2061
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:51,210
Nice, nice, nice.

2062
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:01,590
And we should soon be able to...

2063
01:34:03,710 --> 01:34:06,650
Harness the powers of the...

2064
01:34:07,330 --> 01:34:08,470
Of the Sun...

2065
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:09,950
Of the Sun!

2066
01:34:10,350 --> 01:34:13,530
I'm never gonna save up enough Monkey Bucks at this point.

2067
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:18,810
At this rate, I'll never have enough money to upgrade my Monkeys.

2068
01:34:19,610 --> 01:34:20,170
Yeah!

2069
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:25,130
I think this will help though.

2070
01:34:27,470 --> 01:34:28,850
How large is his range?

2071
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:30,030
His range is insane!

2072
01:34:30,410 --> 01:34:32,110
Maybe I should have screwed him over a little bit.

2073
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:34,110
Look

2074
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:39,240
at the numbers fly!

2075
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:40,780
Go!

2076
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:41,080
Go!

2077
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:43,320
Draw!

2078
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:44,300
Kill!

2079
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:45,500
Kill!

2080
01:34:50,370 --> 01:34:50,850
Yippee!

2081
01:34:51,730 --> 01:34:52,630
Number go up.

2082
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:53,590
Number go...

2083
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,000
One million.

2084
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:00,560
Two million.

2085
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:00,760
Look!

2086
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:03,240
We've had Sauta the whole time and she's at two million.

2087
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:05,940
Druid Monkey at five million.

2088
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:07,060
This guy is so crazy.

2089
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:09,320
That's why I was like, we gotta get him up there, you know?

2090
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:12,380
Monkey Sub isn't killed very much, but that's okay.

2091
01:35:14,620 --> 01:35:15,280
That's fine.

2092
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:17,000
That's alright.

2093
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,100
Three million.

2094
01:35:26,110 --> 01:35:26,690
Thank you!

2095
01:35:26,890 --> 01:35:26,970
Thank you!

2096
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:27,770
Chuu!

2097
01:35:28,370 --> 01:35:28,810
Chuu!

2098
01:35:29,950 --> 01:35:30,970
Guybrush, thank you!

2099
01:35:31,990 --> 01:35:33,330
Think this will help though?

2100
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:35,110
Yeah.

2101
01:35:35,610 --> 01:35:36,050
Hahaha.

2102
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:43,260
005 Alchemist is really strong too.

2103
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:47,980
I almost have it.

2104
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:49,420
I think I was working on it.

2105
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,580
I was working on it.

2106
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:57,320
As you can see.

2107
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:04,720
It is nice to get the stuff to, you know, get more money.

2108
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:06,720
He's crazy for late game?

2109
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,660
I'll add him in then.

2110
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:10,200
I'll put him in like...

2111
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:13,140
Uh...

2112
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:15,520
Hmm...

2113
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:18,480
I really like this mint model.

2114
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:19,320
Credit to the artist.

2115
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:19,840
Thank you!

2116
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:24,740
The artist is Hexose on Twitter.

2117
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:27,320
But their username is like a lot of numbers.

2118
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:28,740
I'll add it to the description.

2119
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:31,420
Oh, I meant to add it to the description of the debut stream.

2120
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:38,100
Put him in the very front, Minto.

2121
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:39,080
Okay!

2122
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:40,480
Hahaha.

2123
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,960
I'm gonna put him right here.

2124
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:51,160
Let's check it out.

2125
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:52,140
Let's see how it works out.

2126
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:55,260
He's throwing.

2127
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:57,300
We're generating cash.

2128
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:59,740
We're generating oodles and doodles of cash.

2129
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:00,300
Money.

2130
01:37:02,540 --> 01:37:03,340
Good job.

2131
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,480
For super late game, he's insane.

2132
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:09,380
Gets 500...

2133
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:09,760
Wait, what?

2134
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:11,040
Whoa!

2135
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:11,980
Gosh.

2136
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:14,180
Oh my gosh.

2137
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:14,540
Oh my gosh.

2138
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:22,850
I never used this enough.

2139
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:24,210
The harpoon thing.

2140
01:37:24,350 --> 01:37:25,290
I know it's really good.

2141
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:27,570
I just always forget about it.

2142
01:37:27,650 --> 01:37:28,330
I'll be honest.

2143
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:34,120
How much is doodles?

2144
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:35,520
Hmm...

2145
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:37,540
A doodle is priceless.

2146
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:43,720
Can you really put a price on art?

2147
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:46,380
There we go.

2148
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:47,040
I just used it.

2149
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:47,760
Hahaha.

2150
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:50,440
Hahaha.

2151
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:51,020
Can you really put a price on art?

2152
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:52,180
How much are you at?

2153
01:37:52,420 --> 01:37:52,860
Nice!

2154
01:37:58,830 --> 01:38:00,190
Gotta upgrade you too.

2155
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,420
Gotta upgrade too many of you.

2156
01:38:07,460 --> 01:38:07,900
Look at him!

2157
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:11,320
Okay, I think we really should focus on the plane though.

2158
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:15,880
And if we have to do other things in the middle, we do other things in the middle.

2159
01:38:21,450 --> 01:38:22,790
Oh, give me that money.

2160
01:38:25,870 --> 01:38:26,650
More money!

2161
01:38:30,430 --> 01:38:33,270
You can use numbers or put a little drone to click for you.

2162
01:38:33,530 --> 01:38:34,630
A little drone?

2163
01:38:35,330 --> 01:38:36,350
Wait, what's that mean?

2164
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:37,950
What do you mean a little drone?

2165
01:38:41,410 --> 01:38:44,150
Is there like a monkey that will push buttons for you?

2166
01:38:44,410 --> 01:38:45,750
If so, that's awesome.

2167
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:48,810
140 will be the bad damage test.

2168
01:38:50,150 --> 01:38:50,950
I'm scared!

2169
01:38:52,930 --> 01:38:53,750
I'm scared!

2170
01:38:54,330 --> 01:38:56,990
Oh gosh!

2171
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:00,190
Maybe we should add more monkeys!

2172
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:00,770
I don't know!

2173
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:04,310
Maybe we should add like another...

2174
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:06,750
Maybe we should do an Apache monkey, you know?

2175
01:39:08,590 --> 01:39:09,830
Maybe an Apache monkey.

2176
01:39:11,790 --> 01:39:13,530
Hire a real monkey to press it.

2177
01:39:27,110 --> 01:39:28,910
Oh, the armored B.A.D.

2178
01:39:28,970 --> 01:39:30,210
Oh, that's what she meant!

2179
01:39:32,010 --> 01:39:32,610
Oh no!

2180
01:39:33,410 --> 01:39:34,170
Oh gosh.

2181
01:39:34,670 --> 01:39:35,750
Wait, so that's the...

2182
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:37,690
It has like the little wraps around it, right?

2183
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:39,450
Why can't you be better?

2184
01:39:39,530 --> 01:39:40,170
Mortar monkey!

2185
01:39:41,230 --> 01:39:42,530
He's like, it's not my fault!

2186
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:43,110
Thank you!

2187
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:47,090
Clockwork, thank you!

2188
01:39:47,570 --> 01:39:49,230
It meant, how about some gamer subs?

2189
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:52,010
By using code BOOMER at checkout.

2190
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:54,310
I've had guacamole gamer fart...

2191
01:39:54,310 --> 01:39:54,850
What?

2192
01:39:55,030 --> 01:39:56,710
And it was good.

2193
01:39:56,810 --> 01:39:57,430
Any recommendations?

2194
01:39:57,850 --> 01:39:58,750
I've never had that one.

2195
01:39:59,150 --> 01:39:59,810
Oh my gosh.

2196
01:40:00,030 --> 01:40:02,350
I think I'm gonna have gamer subs for like years.

2197
01:40:02,910 --> 01:40:03,390
Because...

2198
01:40:03,390 --> 01:40:08,170
I got an email just the other day and it was just like Your gamer subs order has been placed!

2199
01:40:08,310 --> 01:40:09,470
And I was like...

2200
01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:10,390
Huh?

2201
01:40:10,770 --> 01:40:13,610
And they like, gifted me all the new...

2202
01:40:14,450 --> 01:40:15,570
All the new stuff!

2203
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:17,990
It's like a scien... they just released like the scientists.

2204
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:21,710
And they gifted me the skateboard and the jacket and everything!

2205
01:40:22,210 --> 01:40:22,890
It's everything!

2206
01:40:26,890 --> 01:40:31,170
240 super monkeys or whatever is the robo monkey with the village is great damage.

2207
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:32,330
Unless it has changed in the past.

2208
01:40:32,830 --> 01:40:33,810
Oh, thanks turtles!

2209
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:35,470
I don't know if my...

2210
01:40:35,470 --> 01:40:36,450
Wait, what do I have my...

2211
01:40:37,870 --> 01:40:39,350
Oh, go away mortar monkey.

2212
01:40:40,590 --> 01:40:42,190
Well, I don't have it up to 4 though.

2213
01:40:42,350 --> 01:40:43,970
For the robo monkey.

2214
01:40:47,830 --> 01:40:48,850
Are you popping me?

2215
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:50,170
Oh yeah, I'm popping.

2216
01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:54,530
140 coming up.

2217
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:54,910
I'm scared!

2218
01:40:57,190 --> 01:40:58,250
What do you guys think I should do?

2219
01:41:00,730 --> 01:41:02,390
We have the master bomber.

2220
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:04,010
Will that help?

2221
01:41:05,190 --> 01:41:05,950
Will that?

2222
01:41:07,650 --> 01:41:08,730
Let's see how we do next.

2223
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:20,680
Oh gosh!

2224
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:21,920
It's not looking so good!

2225
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:25,360
Stop it please!

2226
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:25,440
Please!

2227
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:31,940
Oh my goodness.

2228
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:41,810
Middle path alchemist can remove fortifications.

2229
01:41:41,890 --> 01:41:42,110
Again?

2230
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:48,500
This guy?

2231
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:50,600
Oh strip!

2232
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:53,300
Oh no, but it's fortified off smaller bloons.

2233
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:55,940
It's not off big bloons.

2234
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:57,800
We need the big, big, big...

2235
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:59,960
We need the biggest bloons.

2236
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:01,680
Hmm...

2237
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:08,150
Hmm...

2238
01:42:08,690 --> 01:42:09,810
Then there's also this.

2239
01:42:09,930 --> 01:42:12,930
Actually, wizard lord phoenix might be really good to have.

2240
01:42:13,110 --> 01:42:17,890
Because we'll have the phoenix out all the time and then we can turn him into a phoenix.

2241
01:42:18,370 --> 01:42:19,930
So maybe I should save up for that.

2242
01:42:22,330 --> 01:42:22,730
Actually...

2243
01:42:23,910 --> 01:42:25,030
Let's collect that money.

2244
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:29,630
2-3 is fine for robo monkey.

2245
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:30,710
I thought it was 2-4.

2246
01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:32,890
But the 3 upgrade is decent enough.

2247
01:42:32,930 --> 01:42:33,890
As long as you have a village.

2248
01:42:34,030 --> 01:42:34,530
They're cheap too.

2249
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:35,470
Hmm...

2250
01:42:39,660 --> 01:42:42,420
You can't remove fortified properties from BADs.

2251
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:43,340
Aww...

2252
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:45,660
Phoenix is not good compared to big plane.

2253
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,760
Yeah, but it's much cheaper.

2254
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:49,580
I can't afford big plane by...

2255
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:50,560
in 2 rounds.

2256
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:51,840
That's craziness.

2257
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:55,060
That's craziness.

2258
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:08,860
I'm going into debt!

2259
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:10,020
I'm dead!

2260
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:14,660
Don't tell the monkeys though.

2261
01:43:17,780 --> 01:43:18,600
Oh gosh.

2262
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:25,060
Sell the boats.

2263
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:28,420
Holy moly!

2264
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:31,660
He's worth so much!

2265
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:36,060
He's worth 28,000!

2266
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:37,760
8,000.

2267
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:43,840
Monkeys and radius have increased sale value.

2268
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:45,800
Well that would be why.

2269
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:48,260
You can sell the boats and you get the plane?

2270
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:49,800
Wait.

2271
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:51,760
No?

2272
01:43:55,620 --> 01:43:56,620
I don't think so.

2273
01:43:58,640 --> 01:43:59,440
8,000?

2274
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:01,760
8,000 is not going to equal to 9,000.

2275
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:02,640
90,000.

2276
01:44:10,610 --> 01:44:12,550
But if I sell all 3 of them maybe.

2277
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:14,850
I mean if I sell this one too then yeah.

2278
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:18,150
Okay.

2279
01:44:18,310 --> 01:44:19,930
Wait, so it's next round though, right?

2280
01:44:20,110 --> 01:44:20,810
I have...wait.

2281
01:44:20,810 --> 01:44:25,110
I can do this one and then it's the next one that I play, right?

2282
01:44:26,070 --> 01:44:26,510
Okay.

2283
01:44:29,410 --> 01:44:29,850
Wait.

2284
01:44:30,070 --> 01:44:30,650
Oh no!

2285
01:44:30,810 --> 01:44:31,470
I was wrong!

2286
01:44:31,930 --> 01:44:32,370
What?

2287
01:44:33,110 --> 01:44:33,550
What?

2288
01:44:34,270 --> 01:44:34,710
Sell!

2289
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:35,390
Sell!

2290
01:44:35,570 --> 01:44:35,590
Sell!

2291
01:44:57,700 --> 01:44:58,580
I know.

2292
01:44:58,700 --> 01:44:59,900
Just cut him up a little bit.

2293
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:00,340
Oh.

2294
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:00,860
Oh.

2295
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:01,920
Come on.

2296
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:03,140
Come on everybody!

2297
01:45:03,220 --> 01:45:04,220
Keep taking him down!

2298
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:05,300
Keep taking him down!

2299
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:08,120
Just a little bit longer.

2300
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,040
Stop juggling.

2301
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:11,700
This is not a...

2302
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:13,320
There's the second one!

2303
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:16,340
Can I please?

2304
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:17,960
Um.

2305
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:20,800
Guys.

2306
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:23,340
Guys.

2307
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:24,540
This isn't looking so good.

2308
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:26,840
Guys.

2309
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:27,900
This isn't looking so good.

2310
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:31,080
This isn't looking so good.

2311
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:32,580
Oh no!

2312
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:34,580
Oh no!

2313
01:45:36,540 --> 01:45:37,100
Uh.

2314
01:45:37,940 --> 01:45:38,500
Uh.

2315
01:45:45,050 --> 01:45:46,350
Oh my god.

2316
01:45:47,930 --> 01:45:48,490
Um.

2317
01:45:49,530 --> 01:45:50,090
Oh.

2318
01:45:50,950 --> 01:45:51,510
Um.

2319
01:45:51,790 --> 01:45:53,210
I don't even know what to put here.

2320
01:45:53,670 --> 01:45:54,230
Oh.

2321
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:54,870
Goodbye everybody.

2322
01:45:56,010 --> 01:45:56,570
Goodbye.

2323
01:45:56,670 --> 01:45:57,350
Round 40.

2324
01:45:59,350 --> 01:45:59,910
No!

2325
01:46:00,030 --> 01:46:01,450
I just got the big play!

2326
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:02,370
What was it?

2327
01:46:02,450 --> 01:46:03,770
It wasn't even worth it!

2328
01:46:04,050 --> 01:46:04,590
Hahaha.

2329
01:46:05,890 --> 01:46:06,450
No!

2330
01:46:07,370 --> 01:46:07,930
Oh!

2331
01:46:09,450 --> 01:46:10,010
Hohohoi!

2332
01:46:10,650 --> 01:46:11,410
Ah.

2333
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:18,880
I blame...

2334
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:19,620
Um.

2335
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:23,020
As a...

2336
01:46:23,860 --> 01:46:26,860
Minto who has gotten to level 183 all by myself.

2337
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:28,440
I blame...

2338
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:29,840
Um.

2339
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:35,540
You guys.

2340
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:36,100
No.

2341
01:46:36,180 --> 01:46:36,820
I blame...

2342
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:37,800
The monkeys.

2343
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:39,580
They had...

2344
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:40,800
They had...

2345
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:42,320
Streaming anxiety.

2346
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:53,760
They...

2347
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:55,320
Performance anxiety.

2348
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:57,940
They have performance anxiety, I believe.

2349
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:00,640
They have performance anxiety, I believe.

2350
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:01,400
Ah.

2351
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:07,420
I never use these.

2352
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:08,300
Hahaha.

2353
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:10,640
Hmm.

2354
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:12,060
But that's okay.

2355
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:13,220
I ended up...

2356
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:14,980
I still was able to get the thingy, so...

2357
01:47:14,980 --> 01:47:18,900
I don't remember what level it was even that I got the...

2358
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:19,800
I don't remember what level it was even that I got the...

2359
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:20,760
183 on.

2360
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,480
Does it say?

2361
01:47:23,140 --> 01:47:23,740
What's that?

2362
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:24,220
Oh.

2363
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:24,620
Sharing.

2364
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,240
Total pop count.

2365
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:31,680
Look how many DDTs.

2366
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,460
Oh look how much cash I've generated.

2367
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:34,320
Crazy.

2368
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,220
Blame going into debt.

2369
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,320
Yeah.

2370
01:47:38,780 --> 01:47:41,160
Most experienced monkey sniper monkey.

2371
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:41,780
Hahaha.

2372
01:47:45,350 --> 01:47:46,610
Insta monkey collection.

2373
01:47:46,850 --> 01:47:48,110
33 out of 1400.

2374
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:49,770
Holy moly.

2375
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:52,190
Golden...

2376
01:47:52,190 --> 01:47:53,770
I've popped 8 golden bloons.

2377
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:00,200
Ah.

2378
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:02,740
It says on the maps.

2379
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:14,160
I don't see it.

2380
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:14,700
It's fine.

2381
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:15,460
Don't worry about it.

2382
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:16,540
Let's see.

2383
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:17,440
Let's choose one.

2384
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:19,140
Let's choose another.

2385
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:20,280
Let's choose another.

2386
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:21,080
Let's choose another.

2387
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:26,880
These ones are pretty cool.

2388
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:29,520
But.

2389
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:30,100
But.

2390
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:33,760
Because I have not reached level 200 by...

2391
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:34,720
By...

2392
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:36,640
At all yet.

2393
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:38,640
I would like to stay on the...

2394
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:39,140
Easier maps.

2395
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:41,700
Just because I will...

2396
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:42,460
Cry.

2397
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:43,740
If it's a harder one.

2398
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:44,820
Cubism is fun.

2399
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:46,320
Yeah I like that one a lot actually.

2400
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:49,820
Kayvar thank you.

2401
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:52,660
If someone were to punt you...

2402
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:53,400
In your chibi model.

2403
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:54,600
How far do you think you would fly?

2404
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:55,460
Asking for science.

2405
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:01,740
With your legs?

2406
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:04,400
I wouldn't even budge.

2407
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:08,620
Don't skip leg day everybody.

2408
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,300
Don't skip leg day everybody.

2409
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:11,340
Resort?

2410
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:13,960
That's like the easiest one isn't it?

2411
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:18,360
I think we could get to level 200 at resort.

2412
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:20,200
Maybe.

2413
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:22,860
Right?

2414
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:23,780
Let's try it.

2415
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:26,180
I'll even do hard mode though.

2416
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:27,060
I'll do hard mode.

2417
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:27,860
Wait.

2418
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:30,940
Yeah I'll do hard mode.

2419
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:31,680
Still.

2420
01:49:32,020 --> 01:49:32,080
Yeah I'll do hard mode.

2421
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:32,080
Still.

2422
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:44,200
Gotta put her there.

2423
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,880
Easy mode for easiest?

2424
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:47,400
Nooo.

2425
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:50,240
I wanna reach it.

2426
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:51,660
I wanna reach level 200.

2427
01:49:52,220 --> 01:49:53,740
How long have I been streaming for?

2428
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:55,240
Two hours?

2429
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:03,120
I need to make...

2430
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:16,460
You just started.

2431
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:21,220
Yeah I just...

2432
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:23,300
Started.

2433
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:24,740
Started.

2434
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:46,880
I will also put in a mortar monkey.

2435
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,300
So that we can get more experience for him.

2436
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:55,220
Oh wait.

2437
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:55,840
Close these.

2438
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:56,200
There we go.

2439
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:59,100
Look at the little rockets here.

2440
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:01,240
And of course.

2441
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:02,660
It wouldn't be...

2442
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:08,640
Without our beloved ice monkey.

2443
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:10,000
Relaxing on vacation.

2444
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:12,140
Yeah.

2445
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:18,600
Yeah.

2446
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:20,700
How much is he anyway?

2447
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:21,040
Okay.

2448
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:21,340
810.

2449
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:24,140
I'll put him in next so that he can get lots of experience.

2450
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:25,380
Because...

2451
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:27,580
If we have this one.

2452
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:28,020
What's this one?

2453
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,040
Super hot burny stuff that incinerates more...

2454
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:31,900
As long as we get 12,000.

2455
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:33,400
We'll see what happens.

2456
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:35,320
We'll see.

2457
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:36,800
We might not make it.

2458
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:37,120
But that's okay.

2459
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:38,780
He's gonna melt?

2460
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:39,280
Nooo.

2461
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:40,600
No.

2462
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:40,920
No.

2463
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:41,840
He's fine.

2464
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:43,120
Look.

2465
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:43,680
It's chilly.

2466
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:45,200
A little bit.

2467
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:46,640
Beep.

2468
01:51:52,550 --> 01:51:53,030
Beep.

2469
01:51:53,090 --> 01:51:53,190
Beep.

2470
01:51:53,190 --> 01:51:53,330
Beep.

2471
01:51:53,330 --> 01:51:53,430
Beep.

2472
01:51:53,670 --> 01:51:54,350
You guys.

2473
01:51:54,410 --> 01:51:55,750
Unless I ask for advice.

2474
01:51:57,590 --> 01:51:59,510
Please don't spam what I should do.

2475
01:52:00,110 --> 01:52:01,110
But I appreciate it.

2476
01:52:01,130 --> 01:52:01,350
Thank you.

2477
01:52:03,170 --> 01:52:03,790
Thank you.

2478
01:52:03,810 --> 01:52:04,270
Thank you.

2479
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:07,830
Ice the monkey.

2480
01:52:09,810 --> 01:52:10,850
Oh ice monkey.

2481
01:52:13,290 --> 01:52:15,710
The worst part is you're not wrong.

2482
01:52:16,010 --> 01:52:17,930
I've got that Slender Man build.

2483
01:52:20,810 --> 01:52:21,330
Nice.

2484
01:52:22,610 --> 01:52:25,270
Isn't Slender Man like in the sexy...

2485
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:28,050
Tumblr sexy man?

2486
01:52:28,850 --> 01:52:30,730
Or am I thinking of the one slur?

2487
01:52:31,390 --> 01:52:32,550
They're the same person.

2488
01:52:32,790 --> 01:52:33,510
I think.

2489
01:52:34,490 --> 01:52:35,010
Oh.

2490
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:37,980
Water monkey.

2491
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,200
Sorry ice monkey.

2492
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:44,140
Your vacation...

2493
01:52:45,620 --> 01:52:46,400
Is over.

2494
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:56,410
They're doing construction right at the resort.

2495
01:52:56,590 --> 01:52:57,150
How terrible.

2496
01:53:00,270 --> 01:53:01,530
Just ruined his week.

2497
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:05,170
There was something I wanted to put.

2498
01:53:05,550 --> 01:53:06,530
I can't remember what though.

2499
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:16,060
Are you going to recreate that ice monkey?

2500
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:21,680
What's wrong with you guys?

2501
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:23,600
Oh well you're wrong forever.

2502
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:28,800
Fixing to go on a big hiking trip and won't be able to see you for a couple of weeks.

2503
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:39,560
Weeks.

2504
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:42,300
You would...

2505
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:43,620
You...

2506
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:44,860
You...

2507
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:46,840
Weeks.

2508
01:53:56,110 --> 01:53:56,630
Weeks.

2509
01:53:56,630 --> 01:53:57,150
Have fun.

2510
01:53:58,590 --> 01:53:59,470
Have fun.

2511
01:53:59,610 --> 01:54:00,390
Good luck.

2512
01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:01,790
Don't get lost.

2513
01:54:01,950 --> 01:54:03,830
And also don't meet any serial killers.

2514
01:54:03,910 --> 01:54:05,430
Unless you are the serial killer.

2515
01:54:05,710 --> 01:54:06,650
Good luck.

2516
01:54:06,770 --> 01:54:07,630
Don't get caught.

2517
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:20,660
Make sure you clean up the crime scene really well.

2518
01:54:27,900 --> 01:54:28,540
Let's see.

2519
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:32,760
Burny stuff.

2520
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:36,180
Nice.

2521
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:39,540
Look at him go.

2522
01:54:39,700 --> 01:54:40,180
Look at him go.

2523
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:46,840
Don't get caught is good advice for both sides of the serial killer issue.

2524
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:48,040
You know what?

2525
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:48,420
True.

2526
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:50,240
That's actually...

2527
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,240
You're actually so right.

2528
01:54:56,700 --> 01:54:59,020
I have to touch grass this week.

2529
01:55:01,740 --> 01:55:03,340
I don't want to leave my home.

2530
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:08,340
After this stream too, I have a bunch...

2531
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:09,040
Well, not a bunch.

2532
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:10,280
I've been...

2533
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:10,420
Oh!

2534
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:13,960
I forgot that Sara can get the...

2535
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:14,580
Good.

2536
01:55:15,320 --> 01:55:16,020
We're fine.

2537
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:16,800
Everything is good.

2538
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:17,640
Everything is good.

2539
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:23,140
Also, this is where Gatlinmonkey is so awesome.

2540
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:25,380
I wish I could just put him down here too though, you know?

2541
01:55:30,380 --> 01:55:32,460
I have a thing I want to put out.

2542
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:33,560
I want to put on the channel.

2543
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:38,000
Basically, for those who don't know, I will be at a concert on Friday.

2544
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:42,940
If you're going to Anime Expo, the concert is not at Anime Expo, but there's still tickets available.

2545
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:45,260
It's close to Anime Expo.

2546
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:46,380
It's during Anime Expo.

2547
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:48,280
So you can come and see me!

2548
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:50,000
And some other YouTubers!

2549
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:51,720
Like Bao and Meori!

2550
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:53,540
And Utano Pandora!

2551
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,520
And we'll be singing!

2552
01:55:57,640 --> 01:55:59,020
It's AX adjacent.

2553
01:55:59,200 --> 01:55:59,680
Exactly!

2554
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:03,420
So if you're at the convention, you can come see us!

2555
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:09,600
Since you're going to go to Anime Expo in Japan...

2556
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:11,220
Wait, I'm not going to Japan!

2557
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:13,420
I'm going to recommend some anime for you to watch.

2558
01:56:13,940 --> 01:56:15,820
No, I'm just going to Anime Expo.

2559
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:19,240
But I don't think I'm going to have time to watch anime.

2560
01:56:19,300 --> 01:56:21,380
You can still recommend them, but I don't think I'll have time then.

2561
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:29,340
Take them out!

2562
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:30,040
Take them out!

2563
01:56:30,540 --> 01:56:31,140
Signal flare!

2564
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:32,940
What does this do again?

2565
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:33,840
Oh, the camel balloons.

2566
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:35,040
Nice!

2567
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,000
Is that the one on NYC?

2568
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:43,800
Anime Expo is in...

2569
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:44,560
LA.

2570
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:46,760
Doki!

2571
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:49,240
Thanks for the ride!

2572
01:56:50,020 --> 01:56:51,940
Did you finish Sand Land finally?

2573
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:55,780
Hi Dragoons!

2574
01:56:56,900 --> 01:56:57,340
Spank!

2575
01:56:57,340 --> 01:56:58,160
Thanks for the tiny gift!

2576
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:01,880
No more sands.

2577
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:02,360
Yippee!

2578
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:04,760
When I came in, you were fighting.

2579
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:06,020
You were like eating.

2580
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:08,200
And then you were fighting a boss.

2581
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:10,520
Then she like rolled you over.

2582
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:12,040
She really took you out.

2583
01:57:12,260 --> 01:57:12,600
Oh my gosh.

2584
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:13,100
Bring it back!

2585
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:15,280
Thank you so much for the vending!

2586
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:17,320
Thank you for the vibe!

2587
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:18,620
Thank you for the vibe!

2588
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:19,260
Thank you!

2589
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:26,500
This map has sand!

2590
01:57:27,860 --> 01:57:30,360
Welcome back to Sand Land everybody!

2591
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:36,500
Welcome back to Sand Land!

2592
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:38,580
You can never escape!

2593
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:44,140
Oh my gosh.

2594
01:57:44,180 --> 01:57:45,360
Thank you guys for all the gifting!

2595
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:46,620
Thank you!

2596
01:57:48,140 --> 01:57:48,160
Thank you Sean!

2597
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:49,140
Thank you!

2598
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:50,260
Thank you Murphy!

2599
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:50,800
Thank you!

2600
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:55,060
You can never leave!

2601
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,320
You can never leave the sand!

2602
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:00,980
You can never leave the sand!

2603
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:03,780
Something something Star Wars quote.

2604
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:04,940
I hate sand.

2605
01:58:05,180 --> 01:58:06,960
It's rough and it's coarse and it...

2606
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:08,340
has cursed my family.

2607
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:14,140
Can we go to the forest land?

2608
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:15,340
I burned the forest land!

2609
01:58:15,340 --> 01:58:15,540
The forest!

2610
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:19,900
This is...

2611
01:58:19,900 --> 01:58:24,600
Oh hey guys!

2612
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:26,520
Welcome back to Sand Land!

2613
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:28,740
Sand Land!

2614
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:30,040
Tomorrow!

2615
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,540
Sand Land the next day!

2616
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:35,140
More and more and more sand!

2617
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:37,440
Sand forever!

2618
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:39,100
Sand always!

2619
01:58:39,940 --> 01:58:41,300
Sand I love it!

2620
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:43,340
It gets in my...

2621
01:58:43,340 --> 01:58:44,040
my bathing suit.

2622
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:45,440
It gets between my toes.

2623
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:47,720
It's so great!

2624
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:48,600
Sand!

2625
01:58:50,860 --> 01:58:52,580
Sand all the time!

2626
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:53,540
Sand in your bed!

2627
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:54,840
Sand in your mouth!

2628
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:56,560
Sand!

2629
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:12,100
Once you're here, you're here forever!

2630
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:12,560
Joy!

2631
01:59:12,740 --> 01:59:13,780
Thank you for the gifting!

2632
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:14,480
Thank you!

2633
01:59:16,620 --> 01:59:18,160
Thank you so much!

2634
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:21,180
I should probably start buying some stuff.

2635
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:22,440
Let's start buying some farms.

2636
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:24,340
I'm just gonna start...

2637
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:26,240
Why is it so hard to place these?

2638
01:59:27,580 --> 01:59:29,020
Wait, we can give him some shade!

2639
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:32,100
Okay, hold on.

2640
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:33,940
I'm gonna strategize this.

2641
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:36,520
One...

2642
01:59:38,020 --> 01:59:38,740
Oh come on.

2643
01:59:38,860 --> 01:59:39,380
Come on!

2644
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:44,880
Two...

2645
01:59:46,740 --> 01:59:47,580
That's all I have.

2646
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:48,100
Down!

2647
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:49,060
Thanks for the donation!

2648
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:49,720
Thank you!

2649
01:59:50,180 --> 01:59:51,800
And we're gonna put this guy right here.

2650
01:59:53,940 --> 01:59:55,080
It's still in his radar.

2651
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:56,300
It's in his radius, right?

2652
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:56,740
Yeah.

2653
02:00:00,420 --> 02:00:01,460
We're playing Bloons.

2654
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,960
Which is like a super addictive game.

2655
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:05,460
Oh my gosh.

2656
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:06,640
Bloons is so addictive.

2657
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:09,160
I could play Bloons for...

2658
02:00:10,120 --> 02:00:10,580
Forever.

2659
02:00:11,020 --> 02:00:12,260
Yeah, Druid is OP.

2660
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:13,360
He's really good.

2661
02:00:20,900 --> 02:00:22,820
Where can we buy tickets to the concert?

2662
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:24,500
Where can we buy tickets to the concert?

2663
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:27,910
Let me get the link for you!

2664
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:29,810
Let me get the link for you!

2665
02:00:29,810 --> 02:00:31,130
Here, I'll just pin it as a tweet.

2666
02:00:31,290 --> 02:00:32,130
Or not a tweet.

2667
02:00:32,290 --> 02:00:32,650
As a...

2668
02:00:33,350 --> 02:00:34,310
As a...

2669
02:00:36,010 --> 02:00:37,050
As a...

2670
02:00:40,130 --> 02:00:40,650
Thing.

2671
02:00:40,910 --> 02:00:42,110
As a message.

2672
02:00:42,570 --> 02:00:47,890
I am performing in a concert on Friday.

2673
02:00:48,090 --> 02:00:48,210
I am performing in a concert on Friday.

2674
02:00:48,210 --> 02:00:48,710
I am performing in a concert on Friday.

2675
02:00:49,150 --> 02:00:50,410
Tickets here.

2676
02:00:52,130 --> 02:00:52,870
Here.

2677
02:00:54,430 --> 02:00:55,170
Paste.

2678
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:02,060
Replace...

2679
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:03,100
Goodbye Ice Monkey.

2680
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:06,540
Goodbye Ice Monkey 000.

2681
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:10,220
Yeah.

2682
02:01:16,570 --> 02:01:17,890
Hi Chibi Minto!

2683
02:01:18,070 --> 02:01:18,390
Hello!

2684
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:29,280
Nice, nice.

2685
02:01:30,220 --> 02:01:30,960
So...

2686
02:01:31,830 --> 02:01:33,860
This one will become the merchant.

2687
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:37,060
And this one will become the bank.

2688
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:38,140
And this one will become the bank.

2689
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:42,460
And then if we get another one, we can have it be the top one.

2690
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:43,640
Alright.

2691
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:45,080
So this one is the bank.

2692
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:47,260
This one is the merchant.

2693
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:49,640
Both have increased production.

2694
02:01:53,180 --> 02:01:54,780
See you in the girls on Friday Minto!

2695
02:01:54,980 --> 02:01:55,240
See you in the girls on Friday Minto!

2696
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:55,660
See you in the girls on Friday Minto!

2697
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:56,740
There he gets back!

2698
02:02:00,180 --> 02:02:02,620
Oh my gosh, as soon as I get there, I have so many...

2699
02:02:02,620 --> 02:02:04,080
I have to sign stuff.

2700
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:04,280
I have to sign stuff.

2701
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:07,560
I have to sign stuff.

2702
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:09,960
Yurien!

2703
02:02:10,020 --> 02:02:11,060
Thank you for that gift!

2704
02:02:15,300 --> 02:02:16,360
Thank you for the gifted.

2705
02:02:16,460 --> 02:02:17,220
Why are there so many...

2706
02:02:19,020 --> 02:02:21,120
There are so many gifted memberships.

2707
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:21,380
Why?

2708
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:24,000
Marketplace.

2709
02:02:25,080 --> 02:02:26,040
Wait for the bank.

2710
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:33,120
I have so few monkeys right now.

2711
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:33,620
It's crazy.

2712
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:36,740
But it's okay.

2713
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:39,920
Everyone must become Wisp.

2714
02:02:42,380 --> 02:02:43,600
Everybody is MFers.

2715
02:02:48,430 --> 02:02:49,070
Oh no!

2716
02:02:49,170 --> 02:02:49,950
They're getting loose!

2717
02:02:52,250 --> 02:02:52,650
Nice.

2718
02:02:54,090 --> 02:02:54,490
Okay.

2719
02:02:54,550 --> 02:02:55,750
Now I don't have to worry about it.

2720
02:02:56,130 --> 02:02:56,530
Oh!

2721
02:02:56,610 --> 02:02:57,290
I have to worry!

2722
02:02:59,430 --> 02:02:59,970
Uh oh.

2723
02:03:00,670 --> 02:03:01,270
You guys.

2724
02:03:02,430 --> 02:03:03,430
I think I have to worry.

2725
02:03:03,650 --> 02:03:04,550
Oh, I have no money.

2726
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:13,740
What were you?

2727
02:03:21,790 --> 02:03:22,830
What are you good for?

2728
02:03:22,850 --> 02:03:23,090
Fire!

2729
02:03:23,790 --> 02:03:24,270
Farms!

2730
02:03:24,270 --> 02:03:24,970
If you don't...

2731
02:03:28,530 --> 02:03:29,010
Restart.

2732
02:03:29,030 --> 02:03:29,470
Restart.

2733
02:03:30,610 --> 02:03:31,090
Restart.

2734
02:03:31,090 --> 02:03:31,570
Restart.

2735
02:03:31,870 --> 02:03:34,310
But we can actually upgrade him now.

2736
02:03:35,190 --> 02:03:35,670
Yippee!

2737
02:03:36,490 --> 02:03:36,970
See?

2738
02:03:37,190 --> 02:03:38,390
It wasn't a total loss.

2739
02:03:40,310 --> 02:03:41,330
Just a little bit.

2740
02:03:42,430 --> 02:03:43,530
I blame Doki.

2741
02:03:48,390 --> 02:03:51,630
I was a member for two months and I never noticed.

2742
02:03:52,010 --> 02:03:52,490
Wow!

2743
02:03:52,850 --> 02:03:53,210
Thank you.

2744
02:03:53,890 --> 02:03:55,730
Unless you've been gifted for two months.

2745
02:03:56,010 --> 02:03:57,270
And thanks to those people.

2746
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:06,940
Mito, you're embarrassing us.

2747
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:07,480
What?

2748
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:07,920
What?

2749
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:08,200
No!

2750
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:11,900
Wait until Ice Monkey hears about this.

2751
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:13,860
Gosh, why is Ice Monkey so expensive?

2752
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:24,110
In fact, I'm going to start doing this.

2753
02:04:24,970 --> 02:04:27,130
Before Ice Monkey makes his little appearance.

2754
02:04:27,770 --> 02:04:29,850
See, I like to put these guys on here.

2755
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:34,910
I like to have my sets aesthetically pleasing as well.

2756
02:04:35,130 --> 02:04:35,310
You know?

2757
02:04:35,750 --> 02:04:38,350
Wait, can I put a...

2758
02:04:44,910 --> 02:04:45,350
Wait.

2759
02:04:45,490 --> 02:04:47,010
Why am I seeing...

2760
02:04:47,570 --> 02:04:52,330
Wait, why am I seeing other...

2761
02:04:53,870 --> 02:04:55,650
I think the chat is weird for me.

2762
02:04:56,970 --> 02:04:58,030
I think so.

2763
02:04:58,610 --> 02:05:00,270
But thank you for all the gifted!

2764
02:05:03,290 --> 02:05:05,350
Basically, I see a bunch of people's names.

2765
02:05:05,350 --> 02:05:06,930
It's like, so-and-so was gifted...

2766
02:05:06,930 --> 02:05:08,910
gifted a membership by so-and-so.

2767
02:05:09,230 --> 02:05:11,190
But they're like...

2768
02:05:12,010 --> 02:05:12,490
Huh?

2769
02:05:12,850 --> 02:05:14,810
I think there's too many gifted memberships.

2770
02:05:14,810 --> 02:05:16,470
Guys, I think you broke my chat!

2771
02:05:17,070 --> 02:05:18,430
I think you broke my chat!

2772
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:23,920
It's lagging.

2773
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:24,720
It's lagging.

2774
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:27,380
What's the backlog?

2775
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:37,660
What's the backlog?

2776
02:05:37,660 --> 02:05:38,180
I'm breaking my chat.

2777
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:42,080
Chill out.

2778
02:05:46,780 --> 02:05:47,480
Locked in.

2779
02:05:53,540 --> 02:05:55,160
We're gonna have a...

2780
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:57,020
a Gatlin Monkey.

2781
02:05:58,160 --> 02:05:59,320
On every corner.

2782
02:05:59,780 --> 02:06:00,620
Hey guys!

2783
02:06:01,100 --> 02:06:02,400
Thanks for the 20 gifted.

2784
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:12,780
Alright, I know I can put him here.

2785
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:16,400
A Gatlin Monkey.

2786
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:18,100
Gatlin!

2787
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:32,340
He's so slow.

2788
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:37,480
Alright, I'm gonna leave it at this for now.

2789
02:06:37,580 --> 02:06:38,900
And I'm gonna upgrade these guys.

2790
02:06:39,620 --> 02:06:40,940
And get more farms.

2791
02:06:41,140 --> 02:06:43,340
And then, I think we'll be good for now.

2792
02:06:43,660 --> 02:06:44,040
I think.

2793
02:06:45,320 --> 02:06:45,760
Villar!

2794
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:47,880
Thank you!

2795
02:06:48,460 --> 02:06:48,900
Membership.

2796
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:51,880
We're Ice Monkey.

2797
02:06:53,420 --> 02:06:54,100
You guys!

2798
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:56,500
I barely have a towel!

2799
02:06:58,900 --> 02:06:59,960
Good luck, Charm.

2800
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:01,540
Where was Ice Monkey?

2801
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:03,320
When we were dying, huh?

2802
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:05,280
Where was Ice Monkey before?

2803
02:07:08,280 --> 02:07:08,940
Oh wait.

2804
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:10,020
Actually...

2805
02:07:10,780 --> 02:07:12,500
Can I fit a village down here?

2806
02:07:13,400 --> 02:07:13,880
Hmm...

2807
02:07:15,020 --> 02:07:16,120
I don't think I can.

2808
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:36,140
Let's see.

2809
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:39,960
I'm just gonna save up enough until we get it.

2810
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:43,720
Shrapnel.

2811
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:45,040
Oh wait.

2812
02:07:45,180 --> 02:07:45,580
No.

2813
02:07:46,140 --> 02:07:47,080
That's not saving.

2814
02:07:49,060 --> 02:07:49,160
I did it!

2815
02:07:50,380 --> 02:07:52,320
I feel like Ice Monkey could use a friend.

2816
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:54,120
Ice Monkey can hire a friend.

2817
02:07:54,220 --> 02:07:55,560
When he has enough money, okay?

2818
02:08:00,380 --> 02:08:02,820
Ice Monkey mommy is not made of money, okay?

2819
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:03,320
Thank you.

2820
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:04,760
Oh my god.

2821
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:05,260
There he goes.

2822
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:06,540
Yes!

2823
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:07,880
Druid!

2824
02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:11,660
Druid!

2825
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:12,740
You are so OP!

2826
02:08:24,650 --> 02:08:25,310
Renting friends.

2827
02:08:25,310 --> 02:08:25,830
Renting friends.

2828
02:08:27,070 --> 02:08:29,410
One's gotta do what one's gotta do, you know?

2829
02:08:30,050 --> 02:08:30,550
Okay.

2830
02:08:32,870 --> 02:08:33,870
Oh, maybe.

2831
02:08:34,850 --> 02:08:36,370
I could maybe fit it.

2832
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:38,290
But I already...

2833
02:08:38,290 --> 02:08:39,450
Maybe I need to sell you them.

2834
02:08:40,970 --> 02:08:44,310
I like to make them fast and strong, you know?

2835
02:08:44,830 --> 02:08:45,390
I like to make them fast and strong, you know?

2836
02:08:45,390 --> 02:08:46,170
Ice Monkey friend funds.

2837
02:08:46,230 --> 02:08:46,790
Thank you!

2838
02:08:47,290 --> 02:08:47,370
Ice Monkey friend funds.

2839
02:08:47,370 --> 02:08:47,370
Thank you!

2840
02:08:49,650 --> 02:08:50,910
Maybe I'll sell him.

2841
02:08:51,510 --> 02:08:51,690
Maybe I'll sell him.

2842
02:08:58,440 --> 02:08:58,880
Yeah.

2843
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:02,140
It's kind of risky right now.

2844
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:05,780
But if I sell him and move him up a little bit.

2845
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:06,920
Like this.

2846
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:09,100
Then he gets a friend.

2847
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:11,620
They're still like by their towels, you know?

2848
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,320
They're still by their towels.

2849
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:16,880
And then...

2850
02:09:19,220 --> 02:09:19,880
It'll fit.

2851
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:20,220
See?

2852
02:09:20,860 --> 02:09:21,680
Just like that!

2853
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:24,120
Awesome.

2854
02:09:24,120 --> 02:09:26,120
And then we can put something over here probably.

2855
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:28,940
Yeah.

2856
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:29,780
Just like that.

2857
02:09:30,540 --> 02:09:30,980
Okay.

2858
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:31,220
Okay.

2859
02:09:31,220 --> 02:09:31,440
Okay.

2860
02:09:31,460 --> 02:09:31,900
Oh,

2861
02:09:38,250 --> 02:09:39,090
it's like 2,000.

2862
02:09:39,270 --> 02:09:39,670
That's okay.

2863
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:41,410
We're not there yet.

2864
02:09:42,590 --> 02:09:43,830
And then we'll get this.

2865
02:09:44,230 --> 02:09:45,450
Shout out to Ice Monkey!

2866
02:09:45,750 --> 02:09:46,150
Yeah!

2867
02:09:48,670 --> 02:09:49,110
Jeezy!

2868
02:09:49,930 --> 02:09:51,450
Ice Monkey friends funds.

2869
02:09:53,550 --> 02:09:54,090
Uh oh.

2870
02:09:54,170 --> 02:09:54,610
Oh.

2871
02:09:54,650 --> 02:09:55,090
It's fine.

2872
02:09:55,190 --> 02:09:55,570
We're fine.

2873
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:02,040
Me saying I wouldn't buy anything else.

2874
02:10:02,060 --> 02:10:03,380
Just upgrade the guys that I have.

2875
02:10:06,740 --> 02:10:07,260
And...

2876
02:10:07,260 --> 02:10:08,280
He'll be fast.

2877
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:21,200
And then...

2878
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:21,320
Oh.

2879
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:25,020
We'll also start adding in some farms.

2880
02:10:26,580 --> 02:10:27,520
Come on.

2881
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:28,160
Come on.

2882
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:28,700
Come on.

2883
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:33,760
We need to buy a new pair of shoes.

2884
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:34,600
We need to buy a new pair of shoes.

2885
02:10:34,620 --> 02:10:35,900
I think he's in radius.

2886
02:10:36,180 --> 02:10:36,640
He's in radius.

2887
02:10:36,660 --> 02:10:36,700
Okay.

2888
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:39,000
How big is your radius?

2889
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:40,480
Okay.

2890
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:41,080
He's in radius.

2891
02:10:41,820 --> 02:10:42,340
Okay.

2892
02:10:50,660 --> 02:10:52,300
This one will be...

2893
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:55,880
Bank.

2894
02:11:00,180 --> 02:11:02,080
We need some sort of monkey emote.

2895
02:11:05,980 --> 02:11:06,500
Someday.

2896
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:08,480
I will get more emotes.

2897
02:11:10,840 --> 02:11:11,360
Someday.

2898
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:11,520
Someday.

2899
02:11:11,820 --> 02:11:12,300
Someday.

2900
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:15,320
Nice.

2901
02:11:22,570 --> 02:11:23,050
Cool.

2902
02:11:24,610 --> 02:11:26,610
We're gonna upgrade what we have right now.

2903
02:11:27,950 --> 02:11:28,770
We're gonna upgrade what we have right now.

2904
02:11:28,770 --> 02:11:29,850
We're gonna work with what we got right now.

2905
02:11:42,280 --> 02:11:43,940
Rude radius gets bigger at level 4.

2906
02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:44,600
Really?

2907
02:11:44,780 --> 02:11:45,040
No way.

2908
02:11:45,400 --> 02:11:45,880
Oh.

2909
02:11:47,540 --> 02:11:48,020
No.

2910
02:11:48,140 --> 02:11:48,240
No.

2911
02:11:48,280 --> 02:11:48,460
No.

2912
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:51,700
We did it!

2913
02:11:57,980 --> 02:11:59,300
We did it!

2914
02:11:59,300 --> 02:11:59,480
Bye.

2915
02:12:00,980 --> 02:12:01,840
At level 40.

2916
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:06,280
This is baby levels, everybody.

2917
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:07,340
Baby levels.

2918
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,700
I forgot about you, Gatlin Monkey.

2919
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:13,780
I forgot you were even here.

2920
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:14,700
Okay.

2921
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:14,980
Hold on.

2922
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:16,360
I'll give you some more stuff.

2923
02:12:17,580 --> 02:12:19,520
I forgot you were even there, Gatlin Monkey.

2924
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:20,800
He's like, I'm doing my part.

2925
02:12:21,020 --> 02:12:21,880
How many have you killed?

2926
02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:22,780
Oh.

2927
02:12:22,820 --> 02:12:23,580
Actually quite a few.

2928
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:25,780
He's doing his part.

2929
02:12:25,780 --> 02:12:26,000
All right.

2930
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:29,860
Can you give the Ice Monkey a 000 attack shooter friend?

2931
02:12:31,060 --> 02:12:32,280
Attack shooter?

2932
02:12:38,130 --> 02:12:39,670
Attack shooter friend.

2933
02:12:45,460 --> 02:12:47,440
Not an Ice Monkey friend.

2934
02:12:51,610 --> 02:12:52,250
This.

2935
02:12:54,850 --> 02:12:55,490
Okay.

2936
02:13:01,290 --> 02:13:06,730
Ice Monkey and his life size attack shooter that they told you not to be afraid of.

2937
02:13:06,890 --> 02:13:08,330
That they told you not to be afraid of.

2938
02:13:08,350 --> 02:13:14,880
This is the perfect relation.

2939
02:13:15,060 --> 02:13:19,220
This is like, you know, when there's people who are just like, I'm in love with the Eiffel Tower.

2940
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:23,860
Like I'm sexually attracted to the Eiffel Tower and I'm going to marry the Eiffel Tower.

2941
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,080
Or I'm sexually attracted to my boat.

2942
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:28,860
That's what Ice Monkey is to Tac Shooter.

2943
02:13:29,780 --> 02:13:32,460
You know what they say, any hole is a goal.

2944
02:13:39,580 --> 02:13:40,060
Precision.

2945
02:13:45,690 --> 02:13:46,170
Nice.

2946
02:14:00,920 --> 02:14:04,580
And actually I'm going to save up for the bank so I don't have to hover over it anymore.

2947
02:14:04,940 --> 02:14:05,700
I'm lazy.

2948
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:08,020
I'm lazy you guys.

2949
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:11,140
What else can we add in here?

2950
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:18,100
I think we should put in... who did we put at the front?

2951
02:14:18,580 --> 02:14:18,880
Oh!

2952
02:14:19,200 --> 02:14:19,680
Him.

2953
02:14:20,120 --> 02:14:21,440
We can put him here.

2954
02:14:21,580 --> 02:14:22,000
Yeah.

2955
02:14:23,740 --> 02:14:26,280
He will do bottom actually.

2956
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:27,500
It's kind of strange.

2957
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:29,460
But I'm going to do bottom path for him.

2958
02:14:30,140 --> 02:14:32,500
So that we can start getting some more money.

2959
02:14:38,120 --> 02:14:40,200
More money, money, more...

2960
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:50,760
We're all good.

2961
02:14:58,640 --> 02:14:59,380
Easy peasy.

2962
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:02,180
Let's get another farm in here.

2963
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:06,240
This one will be merchant.

2964
02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:13,940
Pew!

2965
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:14,460
Pew!

2966
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:18,120
Stonks for real.

2967
02:15:23,730 --> 02:15:24,390
Yes!

2968
02:15:24,410 --> 02:15:25,070
Yes!

2969
02:15:26,270 --> 02:15:26,930
Yes!

2970
02:15:27,430 --> 02:15:27,430
Yes!

2971
02:15:29,190 --> 02:15:31,070
What else can we add in here?

2972
02:15:34,940 --> 02:15:35,820
Mortar Monkey.

2973
02:15:36,860 --> 02:15:38,640
Also we need some boats in here too.

2974
02:15:41,660 --> 02:15:42,320
What?

2975
02:15:45,200 --> 02:15:47,220
It's also good to have a guy towards the front.

2976
02:15:47,380 --> 02:15:49,860
Because the boats can then reach there.

2977
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:51,860
This hole was made for me.

2978
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:52,600
Ice Monkey.

2979
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:55,700
So true Ice Monkey.

2980
02:15:55,940 --> 02:15:57,340
Truer words have never been said Monkey.

2981
02:15:58,920 --> 02:15:59,360
Wait.

2982
02:16:01,780 --> 02:16:04,060
I don't remember how I used to game this part.

2983
02:16:10,980 --> 02:16:13,540
I would like put something here and then the rest he...

2984
02:16:14,020 --> 02:16:15,080
I cannot remember.

2985
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:17,640
I think I would put the flag...

2986
02:16:18,720 --> 02:16:19,260
You know what?

2987
02:16:19,300 --> 02:16:19,820
It doesn't really matter.

2988
02:16:20,140 --> 02:16:20,680
It's fine.

2989
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:22,120
I'm gonna put this guy in here.

2990
02:16:22,600 --> 02:16:23,680
He's gonna be our...

2991
02:16:24,380 --> 02:16:25,660
Top route guy.

2992
02:16:26,540 --> 02:16:28,100
And I'm gonna put this guy in here.

2993
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:32,060
And he's gonna be our...

2994
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:33,600
Middle route guy.

2995
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:37,220
Very nice.

2996
02:16:38,240 --> 02:16:40,320
Alright, let's focus on leveling these guys.

2997
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:42,620
Enzo Mancini.

2998
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:44,220
How do you know about that guy?

2999
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:49,380
How do you know about Enzo Mancini?

3000
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:53,480
How do you know about Enzo Mancini?

3001
02:16:53,480 --> 02:16:54,720
If you don't know, basically...

3002
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:59,080
Okay, so there was like this romance novel series about...

3003
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:01,480
Yippee!

3004
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:04,380
About some billionaire guys.

3005
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:08,580
And he was one of them.

3006
02:17:08,640 --> 02:17:10,340
He was like the guy.

3007
02:17:11,420 --> 02:17:12,380
Enzo Mancini.

3008
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:16,640
And...

3009
02:17:17,740 --> 02:17:18,700
Boy golly.

3010
02:17:18,840 --> 02:17:19,740
What a series.

3011
02:17:20,040 --> 02:17:20,420
Just...

3012
02:17:21,940 --> 02:17:23,800
It's about him and his brothers.

3013
02:17:23,880 --> 02:17:25,060
And they're all like rich dudes.

3014
02:17:35,430 --> 02:17:37,090
Amazon top seller books, of course.

3015
02:17:37,110 --> 02:17:37,870
What was it called again?

3016
02:17:38,050 --> 02:17:38,230
Oh!

3017
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:39,510
Dirty Sexy Boss!

3018
02:17:40,030 --> 02:17:41,250
Is what it was called.

3019
02:17:41,670 --> 02:17:43,550
It was the Dirty Sexy Boss.

3020
02:17:44,090 --> 02:17:44,790
And he...

3021
02:17:44,790 --> 02:17:46,590
Like, it was about this girl who joins this...

3022
02:17:47,230 --> 02:17:48,890
This agency and...

3023
02:17:48,890 --> 02:17:49,430
I mean...

3024
02:17:51,590 --> 02:17:53,990
I'm sure you can infer from the title.

3025
02:17:58,310 --> 02:18:00,070
Is the Dirty Sexy Boss single?

3026
02:18:00,250 --> 02:18:00,450
No!

3027
02:18:00,610 --> 02:18:01,730
Because he's with a girl!

3028
02:18:02,650 --> 02:18:03,450
An OL?

3029
02:18:03,630 --> 02:18:04,370
Yeah, she was an OL.

3030
02:18:07,310 --> 02:18:08,190
I'll be honest.

3031
02:18:08,430 --> 02:18:09,690
I don't know why I can't remember.

3032
02:18:09,790 --> 02:18:12,730
So I think I just have mentally taken it out.

3033
02:18:14,690 --> 02:18:15,710
Of my memory.

3034
02:18:18,970 --> 02:18:19,790
It's a big boy.

3035
02:18:21,730 --> 02:18:22,870
That was so easy.

3036
02:18:23,210 --> 02:18:24,410
We took that big boy out.

3037
02:18:28,350 --> 02:18:30,390
I need you to elaborate, please.

3038
02:18:34,310 --> 02:18:35,050
Well, I mean...

3039
02:18:35,050 --> 02:18:36,410
What else can I say about...

3040
02:18:36,410 --> 02:18:38,550
They went on many escapades.

3041
02:18:40,930 --> 02:18:42,950
I can't infer from the title.

3042
02:18:44,470 --> 02:18:46,290
I remember at one point...

3043
02:18:46,290 --> 02:18:50,070
They were like really trying to get this baby company to join in.

3044
02:18:50,350 --> 02:18:50,490
And...

3045
02:18:50,490 --> 02:18:52,270
It was like drama though.

3046
02:18:52,370 --> 02:18:53,130
It was kind of drama.

3047
02:18:55,670 --> 02:18:56,230
Because...

3048
02:18:59,090 --> 02:18:59,650
Because...

3049
02:19:00,410 --> 02:19:01,770
The guy like...

3050
02:19:01,770 --> 02:19:02,990
Or the baby company...

3051
02:19:02,990 --> 02:19:04,650
The guy took over the campaign.

3052
02:19:05,270 --> 02:19:06,130
The boss.

3053
02:19:07,110 --> 02:19:08,530
Like the head of the company.

3054
02:19:08,530 --> 02:19:09,090
Was like...

3055
02:19:09,090 --> 02:19:11,290
You can't let a lady take this job.

3056
02:19:11,990 --> 02:19:12,550
And...

3057
02:19:14,070 --> 02:19:14,990
But the girl.

3058
02:19:15,110 --> 02:19:15,630
The main girl.

3059
02:19:15,690 --> 02:19:16,030
She's like...

3060
02:19:16,030 --> 02:19:17,430
I understand the baby company.

3061
02:19:18,730 --> 02:19:21,150
No one understands the baby company like me.

3062
02:19:29,480 --> 02:19:30,040
Picasso.

3063
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:30,640
Yeah.

3064
02:19:30,760 --> 02:19:31,580
There's something about Picasso.

3065
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:33,240
Oh!

3066
02:19:33,440 --> 02:19:34,060
Mortar monkey!

3067
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:36,720
Let's get mortar monkey in here.

3068
02:19:37,500 --> 02:19:38,360
I'm sorry.

3069
02:19:38,560 --> 02:19:40,580
I must ruin your little date here.

3070
02:19:45,480 --> 02:19:46,040
Sorry.

3071
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:47,660
I have to ruin your date here.

3072
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:48,300
But...

3073
02:19:49,020 --> 02:19:50,200
It's gaming time.

3074
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:54,320
I've had six babies.

3075
02:19:56,020 --> 02:19:56,980
I don't think she has.

3076
02:19:57,120 --> 02:19:57,420
Look at...

3077
02:19:57,420 --> 02:19:58,440
Mortar monkey is doing nothing.

3078
02:19:58,780 --> 02:19:59,560
Come on, mortar monkey.

3079
02:19:59,660 --> 02:20:00,120
Do your job.

3080
02:20:02,200 --> 02:20:03,420
Maybe I should set him...

3081
02:20:04,460 --> 02:20:04,860
Closer.

3082
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:08,500
Come on, mortar monkey.

3083
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:11,940
There we go.

3084
02:20:16,930 --> 02:20:17,670
Fireworks for them.

3085
02:20:18,110 --> 02:20:18,510
Fireworks!

3086
02:20:21,130 --> 02:20:23,250
What was the other thing that generated lives?

3087
02:20:24,050 --> 02:20:24,450
Oh!

3088
02:20:24,530 --> 02:20:26,490
It was the Chinook, right?

3089
02:20:29,430 --> 02:20:30,730
Let's get the airplane in.

3090
02:20:31,570 --> 02:20:32,970
I feel like I should...

3091
02:20:32,970 --> 02:20:33,170
Okay.

3092
02:20:33,230 --> 02:20:34,810
What I'm going to do is...

3093
02:20:35,290 --> 02:20:39,130
I'm going to put the airplane and the helicopter both in here.

3094
02:20:40,250 --> 02:20:40,650
No.

3095
02:20:42,010 --> 02:20:43,490
But I am going to put a village in here.

3096
02:20:44,610 --> 02:20:45,270
That's for sure.

3097
02:20:46,410 --> 02:20:47,350
That's for certain.

3098
02:20:47,350 --> 02:20:47,650
Okay.

3099
02:20:47,670 --> 02:20:48,410
I'm going to put it where it is.

3100
02:20:53,370 --> 02:20:54,150
Money, please.

3101
02:20:55,630 --> 02:20:56,310
Never miss.

3102
02:20:58,130 --> 02:20:58,890
Rapid fire.

3103
02:21:03,970 --> 02:21:05,050
The Tom Nook.

3104
02:21:06,570 --> 02:21:07,250
Oh no.

3105
02:21:07,290 --> 02:21:09,490
If I get the Tom Nook, then I'm really in trouble.

3106
02:21:11,530 --> 02:21:13,910
Have you guys like played Animal Crossing in the...

3107
02:21:13,910 --> 02:21:16,330
I haven't played it in a minute.

3108
02:21:16,470 --> 02:21:17,650
Like a long, long time.

3109
02:21:19,170 --> 02:21:20,750
I hope my animals are okay.

3110
02:21:21,030 --> 02:21:21,510
Okay.

3111
02:21:21,990 --> 02:21:22,470
Okay.

3112
02:21:22,570 --> 02:21:22,930
Okay.

3113
02:21:31,020 --> 02:21:31,500
Yeah.

3114
02:21:31,500 --> 02:21:31,780
Years ago.

3115
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:32,660
Not since 2020.

3116
02:21:33,620 --> 02:21:34,100
Yeah.

3117
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:47,860
And you know what's so interesting too is like for Nintendo Directs, you never hear people being like, new Animal Crossing, please, because it's just so sad that they stopped the updates for Animal Crossing themselves and like the actual game.

3118
02:21:52,500 --> 02:21:53,340
It's kind of sad.

3119
02:21:57,550 --> 02:21:59,010
It's all about Tomodachi Live.

3120
02:21:59,130 --> 02:22:00,210
I think as it went...

3121
02:22:00,210 --> 02:22:00,690
What's it called?

3122
02:22:00,750 --> 02:22:01,210
Viral.

3123
02:22:01,370 --> 02:22:03,230
People are really wanting Tomodachi Live.

3124
02:22:03,370 --> 02:22:03,670
Yeah.

3125
02:22:09,790 --> 02:22:11,010
I'm a bigger fan of New Leaf.

3126
02:22:11,050 --> 02:22:12,150
I think most people are, right?

3127
02:22:24,940 --> 02:22:27,620
And then they were just like, yeah, by the way, this is the last update.

3128
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:28,960
And you're like, huh?

3129
02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:30,520
Nani?

3130
02:22:31,300 --> 02:22:32,180
What do you mean by that?

3131
02:22:39,100 --> 02:22:40,320
New Leaf was so great.

3132
02:22:51,670 --> 02:22:54,990
I feel like New Horizons was where I suddenly felt no urge to continue.

3133
02:22:55,670 --> 02:22:56,390
That's so sad.

3134
02:22:57,210 --> 02:22:57,570
Oh.

3135
02:22:57,810 --> 02:22:58,170
Oh.

3136
02:22:59,010 --> 02:22:59,370
Okay.

3137
02:22:59,370 --> 02:22:59,490
Okay.

3138
02:23:29,510 --> 02:23:34,490
And then if I'm like, oh, I have to work on something, or I have to leave, I can just save it for later.

3139
02:23:36,630 --> 02:23:37,170
You know?

3140
02:23:38,330 --> 02:23:39,170
It's so nice.

3141
02:23:40,350 --> 02:23:40,990
So easy.

3142
02:23:44,950 --> 02:23:47,130
Alright, let's throw in some wizard monkeys.

3143
02:23:47,290 --> 02:23:49,970
And in fact, I'm just gonna put all three of them right in a row.

3144
02:23:50,170 --> 02:23:50,730
They're brothers.

3145
02:23:51,190 --> 02:23:52,370
This is the three brothers.

3146
02:23:54,550 --> 02:23:55,270
Three brothers!

3147
02:23:56,190 --> 02:23:57,510
You... are the...

3148
02:23:58,210 --> 02:23:58,930
You are...

3149
02:23:59,510 --> 02:24:01,530
You are the guided magic.

3150
02:24:02,250 --> 02:24:04,070
You are the fire magic.

3151
02:24:04,830 --> 02:24:06,890
You are the intense magic.

3152
02:24:08,720 --> 02:24:10,510
But you also all know firewall.

3153
02:24:12,610 --> 02:24:14,010
Anyway, play firewall.

3154
02:24:16,250 --> 02:24:18,230
And you also know...

3155
02:24:19,630 --> 02:24:20,690
This one.

3156
02:24:24,530 --> 02:24:24,860
Yes!

3157
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:26,260
Hey, hey, hey!

3158
02:24:26,380 --> 02:24:28,220
This is not where you're supposed to put your wall!

3159
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:30,060
What are you doing?

3160
02:24:31,660 --> 02:24:32,260
No!

3161
02:24:32,420 --> 02:24:33,760
Put it... Oh no!

3162
02:24:34,300 --> 02:24:35,100
Oh no!

3163
02:24:35,640 --> 02:24:36,560
What the hell?

3164
02:24:37,580 --> 02:24:38,960
We messed up!

3165
02:24:39,060 --> 02:24:40,460
This brother's gone rogue!

3166
02:24:41,540 --> 02:24:42,100
No!

3167
02:24:53,150 --> 02:24:53,750
Yippee!

3168
02:24:57,500 --> 02:24:58,500
Let's keep going.

3169
02:25:07,780 --> 02:25:09,420
He's mad with power!

3170
02:25:09,720 --> 02:25:10,620
I know!

3171
02:25:21,420 --> 02:25:22,180
It's okay.

3172
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:25,680
Alright, let's see.

3173
02:25:25,720 --> 02:25:27,740
What else can we... Let's upgrade this first.

3174
02:25:27,740 --> 02:25:28,380
First strike capability.

3175
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:30,600
Because it's really good to have.

3176
02:25:34,860 --> 02:25:35,820
More farms.

3177
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,000
If you... You guys!

3178
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:37,840
I told you!

3179
02:25:37,960 --> 02:25:39,040
Stop backseating!

3180
02:25:54,580 --> 02:25:57,320
You convinced me to buy this cursed game and play it.

3181
02:25:57,580 --> 02:25:59,640
It's so fun though, actually!

3182
02:25:59,700 --> 02:26:00,740
It's not cursed at all!

3183
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:02,240
It's just a tower defense.

3184
02:26:02,860 --> 02:26:03,820
What's wrong with that?

3185
02:26:04,140 --> 02:26:05,240
What's wrong with tower defense?

3186
02:26:05,240 --> 02:26:08,180
How close are we anyway?

3187
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:09,940
Oh, only 8000 experience?

3188
02:26:10,480 --> 02:26:10,760
Yikes.

3189
02:26:13,340 --> 02:26:15,560
Yeah, it's literally like a dollar to get it anyway.

3190
02:26:15,880 --> 02:26:16,540
It's so good.

3191
02:26:19,980 --> 02:26:21,260
It's just a good game.

3192
02:26:23,480 --> 02:26:24,060
Let's see.

3193
02:26:25,440 --> 02:26:26,360
Oh, wait.

3194
02:26:27,020 --> 02:26:28,540
Yeah, you... Um...

3195
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:32,200
I'm gonna do this one too.

3196
02:26:35,360 --> 02:26:36,840
Do extra damage to ceramic.

3197
02:26:38,440 --> 02:26:39,700
We'll just keep it like that for now.

3198
02:26:39,960 --> 02:26:40,720
No farms.

3199
02:26:40,820 --> 02:26:41,220
Sell them.

3200
02:26:41,260 --> 02:26:43,220
Sell all the... Sell all the monkeys to win!

3201
02:26:43,660 --> 02:26:44,100
Yeah!

3202
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:47,040
No farms!

3203
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:47,760
No farms!

3204
02:26:49,860 --> 02:26:50,740
No monkeys!

3205
02:26:50,780 --> 02:26:51,380
No bloons!

3206
02:26:52,680 --> 02:26:53,320
Everybody's dead!

3207
02:27:01,180 --> 02:27:01,740
Plants vs.

3208
02:27:01,820 --> 02:27:02,260
Zombies.

3209
02:27:02,260 --> 02:27:02,860
Also a dollar.

3210
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:04,820
That's a good game too.

3211
02:27:05,020 --> 02:27:05,720
So is bloons.

3212
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:11,500
Okay, I wanna get Spectre.

3213
02:27:11,620 --> 02:27:13,060
Come on, come on, Spectre!

3214
02:27:13,160 --> 02:27:14,320
Come on, Spectre!

3215
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:24,080
Wait, what is this too?

3216
02:27:24,460 --> 02:27:25,780
Faster firing magic.

3217
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:26,620
Oh, okay.

3218
02:27:29,080 --> 02:27:31,840
I know, I spent money after... Spectre!

3219
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:35,720
Only attack shooter.

3220
02:27:40,600 --> 02:27:42,540
So far, things are not so bad.

3221
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:43,860
I like when bloons pop.

3222
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:47,500
I've become obsessed with bloons.

3223
02:27:47,580 --> 02:27:49,160
Look, we can all just play bloons together.

3224
02:27:50,840 --> 02:27:51,200
See?

3225
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:52,200
Bloons all the time.

3226
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:53,080
Bloons all the time.

3227
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:56,140
Everybody's playing bloons.

3228
02:27:56,640 --> 02:27:58,220
Everybody can play bloons.

3229
02:27:58,600 --> 02:27:58,960
Everybody!

3230
02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:09,340
Everybody can play bloons tomorrow, and then bloons the next day, and then bloons the next day, and then bloons the next day...

3231
02:28:09,340 --> 02:28:12,180
And then bloons the next day, and then bloons the next day, and then you're just like, wait!

3232
02:28:12,820 --> 02:28:13,660
I mean, doh!

3233
02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:14,820
Bloons isn't on the menu!

3234
02:28:14,920 --> 02:28:15,840
I was waiting for it!

3235
02:28:15,880 --> 02:28:16,200
I'm like...

3236
02:28:17,660 --> 02:28:19,140
You are so right!

3237
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:21,680
Bloons!

3238
02:28:30,130 --> 02:28:32,350
Didn't realize she had bloons brain rot too.

3239
02:28:33,150 --> 02:28:36,530
I think I just like tower defense games, right?

3240
02:28:37,670 --> 02:28:38,790
Alright, now...

3241
02:28:39,610 --> 02:28:41,270
I'll add in another vibe.

3242
02:28:42,210 --> 02:28:45,250
This one will be our top production one.

3243
02:28:57,350 --> 02:28:59,030
Oh, I forgot about the DDTs!

3244
02:29:01,530 --> 02:29:02,170
Arknights soon.

3245
02:29:02,290 --> 02:29:04,050
I heard Arknights is really hard though.

3246
02:29:05,050 --> 02:29:05,770
Is that true?

3247
02:29:13,230 --> 02:29:15,530
I also used to play a lot of Battle Cats.

3248
02:29:16,210 --> 02:29:18,350
The devil on my shoulder is telling me I should play bloons.

3249
02:29:18,350 --> 02:29:20,070
The angel is telling me I should play bloons!

3250
02:29:20,650 --> 02:29:21,750
It can be difficult.

3251
02:29:35,090 --> 02:29:37,690
The hardest stage in the event at the moment.

3252
02:29:38,410 --> 02:29:41,170
You know, though... I feel like also...

3253
02:29:41,610 --> 02:29:43,150
Blue Archive can be pretty difficult.

3254
02:29:47,100 --> 02:29:48,280
I don't think it's just me.

3255
02:29:48,480 --> 02:29:48,640
Oh!

3256
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:49,500
Upgrade!

3257
02:29:53,180 --> 02:29:54,100
This one!

3258
02:29:55,380 --> 02:29:56,300
Sky Shredder!

3259
02:29:57,500 --> 02:29:57,960
Nice.

3260
02:30:04,570 --> 02:30:05,670
This guy is crazy.

3261
02:30:07,810 --> 02:30:09,430
Okay, maybe we should get that.

3262
02:30:11,410 --> 02:30:13,890
But first I gotta get the big player, right?

3263
02:30:18,250 --> 02:30:18,710
Umm...

3264
02:30:20,150 --> 02:30:21,170
I'm seeing what else.

3265
02:30:21,370 --> 02:30:23,630
What all we got around here.

3266
02:30:24,690 --> 02:30:25,970
What all can be upgraded?

3267
02:30:26,270 --> 02:30:27,410
What should be upgraded?

3268
02:30:27,750 --> 02:30:28,710
What should we save up for?

3269
02:30:29,230 --> 02:30:29,810
What should we...

3270
02:30:29,810 --> 02:30:30,630
Oh, sorry.

3271
02:30:30,790 --> 02:30:32,150
Ice Monkey, I didn't mean to click on you.

3272
02:30:32,170 --> 02:30:33,010
I didn't mean to disturb you.

3273
02:30:34,690 --> 02:30:36,970
Blue Archive metacomps are a special kind of hell.

3274
02:30:37,010 --> 02:30:37,370
I know!

3275
02:30:38,270 --> 02:30:38,670
God...

3276
02:30:40,670 --> 02:30:41,070
It's...

3277
02:30:41,070 --> 02:30:41,550
It's...

3278
02:30:42,470 --> 02:30:42,870
Yeah...

3279
02:30:43,390 --> 02:30:44,990
For BA, it's just stats though.

3280
02:30:45,150 --> 02:30:45,570
I think...

3281
02:30:45,570 --> 02:30:46,910
Well, recently I've been like...

3282
02:30:46,910 --> 02:30:48,550
Since I've been so behind on...

3283
02:30:48,550 --> 02:30:50,310
Like I'm level...

3284
02:30:50,310 --> 02:30:52,390
I think I just reached level 73 this morning.

3285
02:30:53,170 --> 02:30:55,470
So because I'm behind in levels...

3286
02:30:55,470 --> 02:30:57,230
Like I haven't been catching up with the story...

3287
02:30:57,230 --> 02:30:58,350
Because I've just been like...

3288
02:31:03,820 --> 02:31:05,160
I've just been like...

3289
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:07,320
Focus only on catching up.

3290
02:31:08,780 --> 02:31:11,320
Hard to play BA when I stare at the waifus the entire time.

3291
02:31:11,400 --> 02:31:11,540
What?

3292
02:31:11,560 --> 02:31:13,580
They're so cute when their little TV is running around!

3293
02:31:14,780 --> 02:31:16,080
They're so cute!

3294
02:31:18,340 --> 02:31:19,400
Love those guys.

3295
02:31:22,840 --> 02:31:23,320
Okay...

3296
02:31:27,340 --> 02:31:28,700
I'm gonna go for the flagship.

3297
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:37,520
Almost, almost...

3298
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:38,340
Hold, hold...

3299
02:31:38,340 --> 02:31:38,560
Oh wait.

3300
02:31:38,680 --> 02:31:39,760
I can go into debt.

3301
02:31:40,260 --> 02:31:40,740
Yippee!

3302
02:31:48,030 --> 02:31:49,350
Ready your Kayoko's.

3303
02:31:49,370 --> 02:31:50,630
It's hovercraft Wakamo time.

3304
02:31:53,770 --> 02:31:57,590
Hey Mind, it was my 10 year anniversary of my Jeopardy episode airing a week ago!

3305
02:31:58,130 --> 02:31:59,050
Oh my god!

3306
02:32:00,490 --> 02:32:01,450
Cool Stalker!

3307
02:32:01,570 --> 02:32:01,970
Congratulations!

3308
02:32:02,590 --> 02:32:03,610
Happy 10 year...

3309
02:32:03,610 --> 02:32:04,050
10...

3310
02:32:04,730 --> 02:32:05,590
10 years?

3311
02:32:07,450 --> 02:32:08,890
Do you feel old?

3312
02:32:09,870 --> 02:32:11,510
How do you feel about that?

3313
02:32:11,710 --> 02:32:13,990
How do you feel about it being 10 years ago?

3314
02:32:14,750 --> 02:32:16,170
I don't know why I'm like...

3315
02:32:16,170 --> 02:32:16,370
Oof.

3316
02:32:16,570 --> 02:32:18,930
I don't know why I'm acting like it's a big deal.

3317
02:32:19,010 --> 02:32:20,250
You're the one who should be like...

3318
02:32:20,250 --> 02:32:21,070
Yeah, I feel old.

3319
02:32:22,790 --> 02:32:23,430
That's a you.

3320
02:32:28,720 --> 02:32:29,200
Yes.

3321
02:32:29,280 --> 02:32:30,180
I need a monkey.

3322
02:32:30,180 --> 02:32:31,780
I need a monkey.

3323
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:33,500
I need a monkey!

3324
02:32:34,120 --> 02:32:37,740
I'm holding out for a monkey hero tonight!

3325
02:32:39,060 --> 02:32:46,780
He's gotta be small and he's gotta be fast and he's gotta eat all the bananas.

3326
02:32:47,260 --> 02:32:48,980
I need a monkey!

3327
02:32:52,360 --> 02:32:53,960
One second.

3328
02:33:05,620 --> 02:33:07,220
One second.

3329
02:33:07,220 --> 02:33:07,760
Okay, sorry.

3330
02:33:07,860 --> 02:33:08,360
We're good.

3331
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:12,500
I need a monkey!

3332
02:33:13,780 --> 02:33:17,020
I'm holding out for a monkey hero tonight!

3333
02:33:22,230 --> 02:33:23,270
What am I missing?

3334
02:33:23,450 --> 02:33:25,370
I mean, I'm missing a lot of things, but...

3335
02:33:25,910 --> 02:33:27,310
I'm also just like, what am I missing?

3336
02:33:27,850 --> 02:33:29,190
Let's add another...

3337
02:33:30,750 --> 02:33:32,290
Add another guy...

3338
02:33:33,330 --> 02:33:34,050
In fact...

3339
02:33:34,050 --> 02:33:34,550
Okay, hold on.

3340
02:33:34,630 --> 02:33:35,810
I said I was gonna put a village here.

3341
02:33:48,920 --> 02:33:49,360
Hmm...

3342
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:53,680
I'm trying to decide where I put it because thinking of putting him here...

3343
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:54,820
I don't think he'll get...

3344
02:33:54,820 --> 02:33:56,160
I don't think he'll get...

3345
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:57,300
He'll reach it though.

3346
02:33:57,880 --> 02:34:02,900
Because I want him to be the super storm monkey and then go...

3347
02:34:09,410 --> 02:34:10,270
I'll collect that.

3348
02:34:10,850 --> 02:34:11,770
Thank you very much.

3349
02:34:14,310 --> 02:34:16,150
I do need the preemptive strike tool.

3350
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:19,370
Put him on top of the ship?

3351
02:34:19,450 --> 02:34:19,470
Yes.

3352
02:34:20,170 --> 02:34:21,610
Wait, can I put this on top of the ship?

3353
02:34:21,730 --> 02:34:21,910
No.

3354
02:34:22,570 --> 02:34:24,290
I can put him on top of the ship.

3355
02:34:25,170 --> 02:34:25,890
That is very true.

3356
02:34:25,970 --> 02:34:26,410
Look at him go!

3357
02:34:31,210 --> 02:34:32,610
To the right of Saada.

3358
02:34:32,710 --> 02:34:34,330
Oh, that's such a good idea actually.

3359
02:34:34,730 --> 02:34:35,950
Since he'll blow them all back.

3360
02:34:36,630 --> 02:34:37,370
That's a good idea.

3361
02:34:38,990 --> 02:34:39,630
Good idea!

3362
02:34:40,130 --> 02:34:41,310
Good idea, good idea.

3363
02:34:43,310 --> 02:34:43,950
I like...

3364
02:34:43,950 --> 02:34:45,010
I like having him like that.

3365
02:34:45,070 --> 02:34:45,390
There we go.

3366
02:34:46,470 --> 02:34:46,790
Yes!

3367
02:34:46,930 --> 02:34:47,070
Oh!

3368
02:34:49,470 --> 02:34:49,610
There it is!

3369
02:34:51,650 --> 02:34:53,650
Hey, weren't you supposed to strip those guys?

3370
02:34:53,890 --> 02:34:54,390
What happened?

3371
02:34:54,990 --> 02:34:55,830
What happened, guy?

3372
02:34:56,650 --> 02:34:57,590
What happened, monkey?

3373
02:34:59,890 --> 02:35:00,550
Uh-oh.

3374
02:35:00,570 --> 02:35:00,870
Oh!

3375
02:35:01,350 --> 02:35:01,830
Oh!

3376
02:35:02,010 --> 02:35:02,490
Oh!

3377
02:35:02,490 --> 02:35:03,730
I didn't notice the time.

3378
02:35:10,990 --> 02:35:11,650
It's fine.

3379
02:35:11,770 --> 02:35:12,270
We got this.

3380
02:35:13,150 --> 02:35:14,130
We got that easy.

3381
02:35:14,490 --> 02:35:16,130
Round 100 done.

3382
02:35:17,610 --> 02:35:18,090
Nice.

3383
02:35:26,600 --> 02:35:28,040
How can I upgrade here?

3384
02:35:29,260 --> 02:35:30,600
Maybe I'll just keep saving.

3385
02:35:31,520 --> 02:35:32,680
I'll keep saving up a little bit for now.

3386
02:35:32,820 --> 02:35:33,960
I'll keep saving up for now.

3387
02:35:50,780 --> 02:35:53,400
How can you expect so much from a little monkey?

3388
02:35:54,220 --> 02:35:54,700
They...

3389
02:35:55,360 --> 02:35:55,840
They...

3390
02:35:55,840 --> 02:35:58,820
They are the ones that put themselves up to the task.

3391
02:35:59,640 --> 02:36:00,920
What are you talking about?

3392
02:36:02,960 --> 02:36:03,580
It's them!

3393
02:36:04,180 --> 02:36:05,760
Oh, let's make him super-duper fast.

3394
02:36:08,340 --> 02:36:10,020
We're halfway there.

3395
02:36:10,400 --> 02:36:10,740
Wow!

3396
02:36:13,880 --> 02:36:14,960
Squidward on a chair!

3397
02:36:26,480 --> 02:36:28,320
This map is so easy.

3398
02:36:30,320 --> 02:36:31,140
But that's okay.

3399
02:36:31,940 --> 02:36:34,800
Steam Summer Sales are so good for PopCap games.

3400
02:36:35,860 --> 02:36:37,580
Oh, that's the company that makes this, right?

3401
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:39,300
You're looking extra cute today.

3402
02:36:40,380 --> 02:36:41,260
Oh my god.

3403
02:36:42,300 --> 02:36:43,160
Thank you.

3404
02:36:44,660 --> 02:36:45,480
Thank you.

3405
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:46,320
Hahaha.

3406
02:36:49,660 --> 02:36:50,140
Let's see.

3407
02:36:50,220 --> 02:36:50,880
What was I going to add?

3408
02:36:51,740 --> 02:36:52,220
Um...

3409
02:36:52,220 --> 02:36:52,480
Oh!

3410
02:36:52,520 --> 02:36:52,640
Oh!

3411
02:36:52,660 --> 02:36:53,700
Let's add a...

3412
02:36:53,700 --> 02:36:56,120
The helicopter monkey.

3413
02:36:57,580 --> 02:36:58,840
I'm gonna put...

3414
02:36:58,840 --> 02:36:59,340
Okay, hold on.

3415
02:36:59,780 --> 02:37:01,080
I'm gonna put this here.

3416
02:37:02,640 --> 02:37:04,960
For any other monkeys that will become...

3417
02:37:04,960 --> 02:37:05,300
Radius!

3418
02:37:07,260 --> 02:37:09,180
And I'm gonna put...

3419
02:37:09,180 --> 02:37:10,440
Him.

3420
02:37:15,790 --> 02:37:16,510
But...

3421
02:37:16,510 --> 02:37:18,750
We're gonna go with...

3422
02:37:18,750 --> 02:37:20,010
The Apache.

3423
02:37:22,270 --> 02:37:23,850
And for a start...

3424
02:37:25,210 --> 02:37:25,930
I'm gonna put...

3425
02:37:29,310 --> 02:37:31,510
Oh, why did I grab you?

3426
02:37:37,670 --> 02:37:38,330
Does the...

3427
02:37:39,470 --> 02:37:41,330
Sorry, I have a stutter.

3428
02:37:41,490 --> 02:37:44,870
Does the screen get crunchy?

3429
02:37:46,670 --> 02:37:47,790
When there's so many?

3430
02:37:49,410 --> 02:37:52,990
Squidward on a chair is the school anthem of the Squidward Community College.

3431
02:37:54,190 --> 02:37:55,030
Oh my gosh!

3432
02:37:55,090 --> 02:37:56,450
I forgot about my money!

3433
02:37:59,330 --> 02:38:00,270
Not so far.

3434
02:38:00,530 --> 02:38:01,310
How about now?

3435
02:38:03,830 --> 02:38:04,750
How about now?

3436
02:38:07,630 --> 02:38:08,230
Oh my god!

3437
02:38:08,330 --> 02:38:09,090
Wait, wait, wait!

3438
02:38:09,290 --> 02:38:10,030
Where's my cursor?

3439
02:38:10,850 --> 02:38:11,870
We made it!

3440
02:38:11,970 --> 02:38:12,510
Oh my god!

3441
02:38:13,330 --> 02:38:14,370
That was so scary!

3442
02:38:14,410 --> 02:38:15,150
I could've found my cursor!

3443
02:38:19,310 --> 02:38:21,610
Maybe it's too little too late, but that scared me.

3444
02:38:23,310 --> 02:38:24,430
That really scared me.

3445
02:38:24,470 --> 02:38:25,230
That really freaked me out.

3446
02:38:27,090 --> 02:38:27,490
I

3447
02:38:35,860 --> 02:38:38,200
think I remember having multiple preemptive strikes.

3448
02:38:40,420 --> 02:38:42,200
When I... Okay, so it's this guy.

3449
02:38:42,440 --> 02:38:42,640
Oh!

3450
02:38:42,720 --> 02:38:43,120
Nice!

3451
02:38:43,400 --> 02:38:45,500
Or not the preemptive, but the first strike capability.

3452
02:38:46,960 --> 02:38:49,880
I'm not gonna upgrade just yet, because I'm gonna get another guy.

3453
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:52,960
That is...

3454
02:38:53,960 --> 02:38:55,600
Does that, like so.

3455
02:38:57,800 --> 02:38:59,320
And the longer range.

3456
02:39:01,560 --> 02:39:02,520
And then...

3457
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:04,400
Yeah.

3458
02:39:06,840 --> 02:39:07,720
What's the other one?

3459
02:39:07,780 --> 02:39:08,600
Oh, the...

3460
02:39:10,960 --> 02:39:12,260
The triple gun.

3461
02:39:12,480 --> 02:39:13,420
The triple gun.

3462
02:39:17,620 --> 02:39:18,140
Oh!

3463
02:39:24,260 --> 02:39:25,480
I don't see Ice Monkey.

3464
02:39:25,600 --> 02:39:26,080
He's right here!

3465
02:39:26,400 --> 02:39:27,160
What are you talking about?

3466
02:39:27,700 --> 02:39:29,200
He's been here the whole time.

3467
02:39:40,570 --> 02:39:42,350
Oh wait, how's my bank?

3468
02:39:42,850 --> 02:39:44,830
Nice, it was almost maxed.

3469
02:39:47,030 --> 02:39:48,070
And then...

3470
02:39:48,070 --> 02:39:50,150
That one was close.

3471
02:39:50,570 --> 02:39:53,030
That one was kinda close.

3472
02:39:53,690 --> 02:39:54,990
Yeah, he's just juggling.

3473
02:39:55,230 --> 02:39:56,010
He's just hanging out.

3474
02:39:57,270 --> 02:39:58,190
Being a little guy.

3475
02:39:58,830 --> 02:40:00,130
I'm not gonna upgrade those.

3476
02:40:01,450 --> 02:40:02,570
Um, let's see.

3477
02:40:03,230 --> 02:40:04,810
Is there anything I can upgrade?

3478
02:40:06,150 --> 02:40:07,650
Is there something behind him?

3479
02:40:07,730 --> 02:40:08,330
I don't remember.

3480
02:40:11,770 --> 02:40:12,250
Nope.

3481
02:40:13,210 --> 02:40:14,290
Let's do the druid.

3482
02:40:16,430 --> 02:40:17,850
Let's save up for the druid.

3483
02:40:22,230 --> 02:40:22,950
My guy!

3484
02:40:22,950 --> 02:40:30,030
My mortar guy is not taking out all the little shattering shells.

3485
02:40:31,410 --> 02:40:32,310
What are you doing?

3486
02:40:37,080 --> 02:40:38,160
Oh, so close!

3487
02:40:38,520 --> 02:40:39,340
Wait, am I...

3488
02:40:40,140 --> 02:40:41,200
No, I don't have enough.

3489
02:40:41,560 --> 02:40:45,320
The menu is accessibility that allows you to turn off effects for most monkeys.

3490
02:40:45,400 --> 02:40:47,460
It helps in late game when the screen will freeze from effects.

3491
02:40:47,600 --> 02:40:48,140
Ah, thank you!

3492
02:40:49,060 --> 02:40:50,380
I think we're good for now.

3493
02:40:50,500 --> 02:40:52,480
But I'll keep that in mind for later.

3494
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:52,920
Hahaha!

3495
02:40:53,960 --> 02:40:54,340
Oh!

3496
02:40:58,130 --> 02:40:59,190
We're so close!

3497
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:04,460
Yes!

3498
02:41:05,660 --> 02:41:07,060
Okay, we at least have that guy.

3499
02:41:07,280 --> 02:41:09,080
Alright, we're just gonna go into the next one, baby.

3500
02:41:10,460 --> 02:41:11,580
Keep on, keep it on!

3501
02:41:11,720 --> 02:41:12,540
Keep on, keep it on!

3502
02:41:12,760 --> 02:41:13,740
Keep on, keep it on!

3503
02:41:34,430 --> 02:41:34,810
Nice!

3504
02:41:37,890 --> 02:41:38,870
Nice, nice, nice!

3505
02:41:42,090 --> 02:41:42,910
Go, go, go!

3506
02:41:43,670 --> 02:41:43,770
Seven!

3507
02:41:45,290 --> 02:41:45,810
Oh!

3508
02:41:46,410 --> 02:41:47,290
My bananas!

3509
02:41:51,890 --> 02:41:52,930
My bananas!

3510
02:41:55,790 --> 02:41:56,310
Nice!

3511
02:41:56,910 --> 02:41:59,030
I'll be honest though, I think this will be...

3512
02:41:59,670 --> 02:42:00,190
I'm not...

3513
02:42:00,190 --> 02:42:04,490
If I don't make it to 200 in this try...

3514
02:42:04,490 --> 02:42:06,290
We will try another day.

3515
02:42:06,430 --> 02:42:07,330
And I'll change the thumbnail.

3516
02:42:07,690 --> 02:42:08,430
I'll change the...

3517
02:42:10,950 --> 02:42:11,470
No.

3518
02:42:11,610 --> 02:42:12,730
Actually, I'm gonna say...

3519
02:42:13,670 --> 02:42:15,030
I'm gonna change it.

3520
02:42:15,070 --> 02:42:15,630
I'm gonna be like...

3521
02:42:16,670 --> 02:42:17,990
200 tutorial!

3522
02:42:19,460 --> 02:42:22,550
How to make it to level 200 in Bloon's tutorial!

3523
02:42:24,810 --> 02:42:25,470
Obviously!

3524
02:42:27,290 --> 02:42:29,270
I'm gonna put another guy down here.

3525
02:42:29,510 --> 02:42:30,890
Except this guy...

3526
02:42:30,890 --> 02:42:33,290
Will be the rocket storm.

3527
02:42:36,530 --> 02:42:38,450
Locked and loaded, baby!

3528
02:42:48,880 --> 02:42:49,440
Yeah!

3529
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,120
Go level 112 or bus!

3530
02:42:52,400 --> 02:42:52,960
Hahaha!

3531
02:42:54,200 --> 02:42:55,680
What did we make in the...

3532
02:42:55,680 --> 02:42:57,420
What did we make it to in the last one?

3533
02:42:57,540 --> 02:42:57,980
I don't remember.

3534
02:43:08,770 --> 02:43:09,330
140!

3535
02:43:10,230 --> 02:43:11,190
Oh, that's right!

3536
02:43:11,310 --> 02:43:12,310
The infamous 140!

3537
02:43:14,210 --> 02:43:15,230
Infamous 140.

3538
02:43:15,710 --> 02:43:16,370
Yeah, yeah.

3539
02:43:16,990 --> 02:43:18,110
How could I forget?

3540
02:43:24,210 --> 02:43:24,770
TDT's!

3541
02:43:24,770 --> 02:43:25,270
There is a...

3542
02:43:27,670 --> 02:43:29,930
Why is there a single tac shooter on a chair?

3543
02:43:30,210 --> 02:43:31,750
To keep Ice Monkey...

3544
02:43:31,750 --> 02:43:32,550
Um...

3545
02:43:33,790 --> 02:43:34,350
Company.

3546
02:43:37,150 --> 02:43:38,110
They're besties.

3547
02:43:41,350 --> 02:43:42,330
They're besties.

3548
02:43:43,310 --> 02:43:45,050
They're just keeping each other company.

3549
02:43:45,530 --> 02:43:46,230
You know?

3550
02:43:48,310 --> 02:43:49,150
As you do.

3551
02:43:53,170 --> 02:43:55,030
Why are you putting company in quotes?

3552
02:43:56,350 --> 02:43:59,330
No matter what type of company it is, it's still company.

3553
02:44:04,380 --> 02:44:05,520
Company is company.

3554
02:44:14,230 --> 02:44:14,730
Nice.

3555
02:44:18,550 --> 02:44:20,730
I kind of want another...

3556
02:44:20,730 --> 02:44:22,550
I want the middle path, maybe.

3557
02:44:24,490 --> 02:44:26,370
We can put that one anywhere though, basically.

3558
02:44:26,890 --> 02:44:28,070
So I'm gonna put it...

3559
02:44:28,070 --> 02:44:29,810
Well, I mean...

3560
02:44:30,550 --> 02:44:31,430
You know what I mean.

3561
02:44:31,910 --> 02:44:33,650
Actually, we can put like a town right here.

3562
02:44:34,510 --> 02:44:37,210
And kind of support some guys down in this area.

3563
02:44:40,050 --> 02:44:41,750
So I'm gonna put this guy here.

3564
02:44:46,880 --> 02:44:49,720
Well, he doesn't necessarily need to be faster, does he?

3565
02:44:49,860 --> 02:44:50,760
But, it's okay.

3566
02:44:53,280 --> 02:44:54,400
I'm gonna put some other guys.

3567
02:44:54,500 --> 02:44:55,780
I'm gonna put some ninjas down there.

3568
02:44:56,640 --> 02:44:57,340
Oh my god.

3569
02:44:57,420 --> 02:44:57,940
Oh my god.

3570
02:44:57,980 --> 02:44:58,420
Oh my god.

3571
02:44:58,420 --> 02:44:59,080
Oh my god.

3572
02:44:59,080 --> 02:44:59,320
Oh my god.

3573
02:44:59,800 --> 02:45:00,180
Oh.

3574
02:45:02,400 --> 02:45:02,780
Oops.

3575
02:45:03,760 --> 02:45:04,900
I messed up the timing.

3576
02:45:10,940 --> 02:45:11,340
821!

3577
02:45:12,060 --> 02:45:13,260
Welcome to Mambo Shop.

3578
02:45:13,300 --> 02:45:13,760
Thank you!

3579
02:45:15,460 --> 02:45:16,580
That was a little frightening.

3580
02:45:16,800 --> 02:45:18,120
That was a little scary, you guys.

3581
02:45:19,620 --> 02:45:20,500
Helicopter's freaking it.

3582
02:45:20,620 --> 02:45:21,500
That's why he needs help.

3583
02:45:23,880 --> 02:45:24,280
Wait!

3584
02:45:24,460 --> 02:45:25,640
This doesn't even fit down here?

3585
02:45:25,820 --> 02:45:26,380
Oh, yes it does.

3586
02:45:26,480 --> 02:45:26,860
Kind of.

3587
02:45:28,060 --> 02:45:28,460
Alright.

3588
02:45:30,140 --> 02:45:30,580
Upgrades.

3589
02:45:30,620 --> 02:45:32,960
We're going with the middle route.

3590
02:45:33,400 --> 02:45:34,360
Middle, middle, middle.

3591
02:45:35,500 --> 02:45:36,580
And we'll do...

3592
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:39,660
Which one?

3593
02:45:39,840 --> 02:45:40,420
Oh, pursuit.

3594
02:45:40,600 --> 02:45:41,020
Pursuit.

3595
02:45:41,460 --> 02:45:42,100
There we go.

3596
02:45:42,200 --> 02:45:42,460
Okay.

3597
02:45:43,560 --> 02:45:44,920
I like to not do anything.

3598
02:45:56,430 --> 02:45:56,870
Okay.

3599
02:45:56,870 --> 02:45:57,790
So far, so good.

3600
02:46:07,260 --> 02:46:08,360
I heard that.

3601
02:46:10,960 --> 02:46:11,580
Grab it.

3602
02:46:11,640 --> 02:46:12,680
Oh, there's nothing to grab.

3603
02:46:14,480 --> 02:46:15,120
There we go.

3604
02:46:15,180 --> 02:46:15,360
Nice.

3605
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:19,480
Nice!

3606
02:46:19,940 --> 02:46:20,960
Nice, nice, nice.

3607
02:46:21,760 --> 02:46:22,620
Level 20.

3608
02:46:24,020 --> 02:46:25,400
She looks so cool.

3609
02:46:26,600 --> 02:46:27,800
I need this guy.

3610
02:46:27,960 --> 02:46:29,100
I need this guy up.

3611
02:46:29,740 --> 02:46:30,220
Okay.

3612
02:46:30,440 --> 02:46:32,580
I need to stop spending useless money, I guess.

3613
02:46:34,540 --> 02:46:36,680
I need to make strategic calls.

3614
02:46:38,300 --> 02:46:40,400
I have too much performance anxiety.

3615
02:46:43,620 --> 02:46:44,940
Tack shooter pop stuff?

3616
02:46:45,120 --> 02:46:45,480
How?

3617
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:49,560
Wait, how?

3618
02:46:52,040 --> 02:46:52,980
How does...

3619
02:46:52,980 --> 02:46:53,800
What?

3620
02:46:54,480 --> 02:46:56,460
How has tack shooter pop stuff?

3621
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:00,600
Huh?

3622
02:47:03,060 --> 02:47:04,540
Oh, the blimps are fat.

3623
02:47:04,700 --> 02:47:05,220
Hahaha.

3624
02:47:08,490 --> 02:47:09,510
Oh my gosh.

3625
02:47:09,510 --> 02:47:11,290
He's just like, don't worry, ice monkey.

3626
02:47:11,970 --> 02:47:13,570
I'll take care of it for you.

3627
02:47:15,650 --> 02:47:17,130
Guys, I don't know about...

3628
02:47:18,010 --> 02:47:19,310
I don't know about this round.

3629
02:47:19,390 --> 02:47:19,710
I don't know.

3630
02:47:19,710 --> 02:47:20,470
I'm not feeling it.

3631
02:47:21,230 --> 02:47:22,610
Not like this round in particular.

3632
02:47:22,670 --> 02:47:24,430
But like this whole...

3633
02:47:26,550 --> 02:47:27,810
I don't know how to feel.

3634
02:47:30,150 --> 02:47:30,510
Hmm...

3635
02:47:31,210 --> 02:47:31,830
Done, done.

3636
02:47:32,010 --> 02:47:32,690
Welcome to membership.

3637
02:47:33,110 --> 02:47:33,550
Thank you.

3638
02:47:36,010 --> 02:47:38,270
Maybe we need... I need another mortar monkey.

3639
02:47:40,510 --> 02:47:41,670
In this area.

3640
02:47:43,150 --> 02:47:44,490
Set target here.

3641
02:47:49,420 --> 02:47:50,180
Like so.

3642
02:48:01,140 --> 02:48:02,520
My favorite hero?

3643
02:48:05,100 --> 02:48:05,660
Hmm...

3644
02:48:05,660 --> 02:48:07,540
I really like sniper monkey.

3645
02:48:07,720 --> 02:48:09,280
But I think it's now druid monkey.

3646
02:48:11,880 --> 02:48:13,600
He's gotten me out of so...

3647
02:48:13,600 --> 02:48:14,680
He's helped me so much.

3648
02:48:14,920 --> 02:48:15,840
He gets me money.

3649
02:48:15,960 --> 02:48:16,520
He's helped me out of so...

3650
02:48:16,520 --> 02:48:17,800
He generates me lives.

3651
02:48:19,840 --> 02:48:22,160
Just an all around really pleasant guy.

3652
02:48:22,320 --> 02:48:22,620
You know?

3653
02:48:25,620 --> 02:48:28,120
In fact, if I put like a glue monkey here.

3654
02:48:28,240 --> 02:48:29,200
And then the mortar...

3655
02:48:29,200 --> 02:48:31,460
Wait, see why isn't it taking it out?

3656
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:33,160
Is it only for moabs in this?

3657
02:48:33,620 --> 02:48:34,540
Well, that's so lame.

3658
02:48:37,580 --> 02:48:38,460
Unless I...

3659
02:48:39,420 --> 02:48:40,080
Is it...

3660
02:48:40,080 --> 02:48:42,280
Once this, will it take it off of the...

3661
02:48:42,280 --> 02:48:43,060
Of these guys?

3662
02:48:43,180 --> 02:48:43,920
The ZOMGs?

3663
02:48:44,860 --> 02:48:46,500
Yeah, but if I put a glue guy here...

3664
02:48:46,520 --> 02:48:48,420
It might help it a little bit, I think.

3665
02:48:49,100 --> 02:48:50,500
So, glue man.

3666
02:48:50,880 --> 02:48:51,680
Glue man.

3667
02:48:52,680 --> 02:48:54,600
We're gonna put you right there, buddy.

3668
02:48:55,440 --> 02:48:56,760
Glue, glue, glue, glue.

3669
02:48:56,960 --> 02:48:57,540
Glue, glue.

3670
02:49:11,240 --> 02:49:12,680
It's getting pierce capped.

3671
02:49:12,740 --> 02:49:13,220
What's that mean?

3672
02:49:14,240 --> 02:49:16,280
So like there's too many other things?

3673
02:49:17,760 --> 02:49:18,740
I don't think you can...

3674
02:49:18,740 --> 02:49:20,620
Strip fortify it from ZOMGs.

3675
02:49:20,840 --> 02:49:21,300
Okay, okay.

3676
02:49:22,680 --> 02:49:23,720
If that's the case.

3677
02:49:25,020 --> 02:49:26,600
Unless it needs just a little extra...

3678
02:49:26,620 --> 02:49:27,260
help, you know?

3679
02:49:27,520 --> 02:49:28,320
No, no, no.

3680
02:49:28,400 --> 02:49:29,120
No glue gunner.

3681
02:49:30,360 --> 02:49:31,540
I've been trying to get the...

3682
02:49:31,540 --> 02:49:34,720
I've been trying to unlock this to the bottom for...

3683
02:49:35,420 --> 02:49:36,020
You know what?

3684
02:49:36,060 --> 02:49:36,840
Let's just stick him in there.

3685
02:49:40,240 --> 02:49:41,540
What's it gonna hurt, huh?

3686
02:49:43,580 --> 02:49:44,720
Oh, my wallet.

3687
02:49:44,860 --> 02:49:45,460
That's what it hurts.

3688
02:49:46,120 --> 02:49:46,780
It's okay though.

3689
02:49:48,940 --> 02:49:49,700
Why crikey.

3690
02:49:50,600 --> 02:49:52,100
Taking out those moabs.

3691
02:49:54,700 --> 02:49:55,920
He's slightly British.

3692
02:49:56,140 --> 02:49:57,700
He grew up in...

3693
02:49:57,700 --> 02:49:59,720
both Australia and in Britain.

3694
02:50:01,220 --> 02:50:01,820
There

3695
02:50:09,910 --> 02:50:10,130
we go.

3696
02:50:11,790 --> 02:50:13,510
Small purchase never hurts.

3697
02:50:17,170 --> 02:50:18,090
What do we have?

3698
02:50:18,270 --> 02:50:19,010
Oh, what is that?

3699
02:50:27,130 --> 02:50:28,950
It's so fast.

3700
02:50:30,730 --> 02:50:31,130
Wow.

3701
02:50:33,650 --> 02:50:34,830
A power shopper.

3702
02:50:34,850 --> 02:50:36,630
Wanted to save up for a druid upgrade.

3703
02:50:36,850 --> 02:50:37,130
No, no.

3704
02:50:37,150 --> 02:50:38,410
I got the druid upgrade.

3705
02:50:39,230 --> 02:50:40,190
Oh, this one.

3706
02:50:40,790 --> 02:50:41,710
This one over here.

3707
02:50:41,830 --> 02:50:42,390
Yeah, you're right.

3708
02:50:45,970 --> 02:50:46,710
You're right.

3709
02:50:47,490 --> 02:50:48,090
You're right.

3710
02:50:48,130 --> 02:50:48,870
I messed that one up.

3711
02:50:48,950 --> 02:50:49,290
You're right.

3712
02:50:49,790 --> 02:50:51,050
That one is my bad.

3713
02:50:54,010 --> 02:50:55,650
That one is my bad.

3714
02:50:55,650 --> 02:50:58,690
That one is my bad.

3715
02:50:58,690 --> 02:50:58,930
That one is my bad.

3716
02:50:58,930 --> 02:51:00,170
It's fine.

3717
02:51:01,130 --> 02:51:01,650
Probably.

3718
02:51:15,570 --> 02:51:16,090
See?

3719
02:51:16,210 --> 02:51:18,550
We're almost halfway there.

3720
02:51:19,550 --> 02:51:20,690
We're almost even...

3721
02:51:20,690 --> 02:51:21,510
We're almost there.

3722
02:51:21,850 --> 02:51:23,750
You know?

3723
02:51:26,810 --> 02:51:27,670
We got this.

3724
02:51:28,030 --> 02:51:29,490
Actually, I need to upgrade this one.

3725
02:51:29,850 --> 02:51:31,410
Well, not anymore.

3726
02:51:32,810 --> 02:51:33,590
But you know what I mean.

3727
02:51:52,060 --> 02:51:52,720
Handle it.

3728
02:51:54,760 --> 02:51:55,440
Thank you.

3729
02:51:56,140 --> 02:51:56,600
Oh my gosh.

3730
02:51:56,780 --> 02:51:57,520
Took forever.

3731
02:51:59,740 --> 02:52:00,400
Oh god.

3732
02:52:02,300 --> 02:52:04,240
Yeah, we're gonna get this guy up.

3733
02:52:04,560 --> 02:52:06,220
Before 140 maybe.

3734
02:52:06,440 --> 02:52:07,440
Who knows actually.

3735
02:52:07,640 --> 02:52:08,640
At this rate...

3736
02:52:08,640 --> 02:52:09,520
Who knows.

3737
02:52:16,280 --> 02:52:17,760
This is not optimal.

3738
02:52:18,740 --> 02:52:20,120
Even for my standards.

3739
02:52:23,060 --> 02:52:23,580
But...

3740
02:52:23,580 --> 02:52:25,200
We could sell a few things.

3741
02:52:25,580 --> 02:52:27,520
I could honestly sell this for now.

3742
02:52:37,130 --> 02:52:38,790
But other things I must keep around.

3743
02:52:41,630 --> 02:52:42,910
We have Ice Monkey!

3744
02:52:43,070 --> 02:52:43,270
True!

3745
02:52:46,670 --> 02:52:47,130
True.

3746
02:52:47,410 --> 02:52:48,330
We must believe.

3747
02:52:48,630 --> 02:52:49,730
We have Ice Monkey.

3748
02:52:52,690 --> 02:52:54,850
I don't even have these guys maxed.

3749
02:52:56,510 --> 02:52:57,430
I don't even have these guys maxed.

3750
02:52:57,430 --> 02:52:58,550
Maybe it's because I've been playing on hard.

3751
02:52:58,750 --> 02:53:00,950
I think I got to the 183 on...

3752
02:53:00,950 --> 02:53:02,590
Not easy, on normal.

3753
02:53:04,150 --> 02:53:05,250
I think so.

3754
02:53:05,870 --> 02:53:06,650
I think so.

3755
02:53:06,650 --> 02:53:06,890
I think so.

3756
02:53:17,300 --> 02:53:19,640
I might just need to put a glue gunner up here too.

3757
02:53:20,240 --> 02:53:20,860
I think so.

3758
02:53:20,860 --> 02:53:21,380
It really does help.

3759
02:53:21,460 --> 02:53:23,320
But it really helps around this part because...

3760
02:53:23,320 --> 02:53:27,140
There's just a lot of good stuff over here.

3761
02:53:28,700 --> 02:53:29,360
There's just a lot of good stuff over here.

3762
02:53:30,160 --> 02:53:30,600
Yeah!

3763
02:53:30,740 --> 02:53:31,440
Glue gunner!

3764
02:53:32,480 --> 02:53:32,920
Yeah!

3765
02:53:33,040 --> 02:53:33,660
You know what?

3766
02:53:33,980 --> 02:53:35,420
Let's max upgrade him even.

3767
02:53:38,220 --> 02:53:38,660
Yeah!

3768
02:53:38,660 --> 02:53:38,980
Yeah!

3769
02:53:53,130 --> 02:53:54,290
Glue his base.

3770
02:53:54,510 --> 02:53:55,010
I think, yeah.

3771
02:54:01,280 --> 02:54:04,160
It was something that I did not appreciate enough...

3772
02:54:04,160 --> 02:54:04,800
Until...

3773
02:54:05,800 --> 02:54:07,500
Until later on.

3774
02:54:09,740 --> 02:54:11,540
Druid 2 never be maxed.

3775
02:54:11,580 --> 02:54:12,200
Shhh!

3776
02:54:12,320 --> 02:54:13,300
I'll get there!

3777
02:54:20,830 --> 02:54:22,310
Just you wait.

3778
02:54:23,450 --> 02:54:24,680
Just you wait.

3779
02:54:26,390 --> 02:54:27,210
Just you wait.

3780
02:54:28,550 --> 02:54:29,730
What if I put a...

3781
02:54:29,730 --> 02:54:30,310
Can I put...

3782
02:54:30,310 --> 02:54:31,190
Oh my gosh!

3783
02:54:32,630 --> 02:54:33,510
It's kind of fun.

3784
02:54:35,310 --> 02:54:36,210
Having some...

3785
02:54:36,210 --> 02:54:37,710
Having these two up on here.

3786
02:54:39,090 --> 02:54:39,770
No, no, no.

3787
02:54:39,850 --> 02:54:40,570
I have to save.

3788
02:54:41,790 --> 02:54:43,010
I have to save money!

3789
02:54:44,710 --> 02:54:47,970
I don't think he even does anything against the BADs.

3790
02:54:47,970 --> 02:54:48,510
But that's okay.

3791
02:54:49,930 --> 02:54:50,650
That's okay.

3792
02:54:51,050 --> 02:54:51,730
Thank you.

3793
02:54:51,730 --> 02:54:51,750
Thank you.

3794
02:55:03,160 --> 02:55:04,700
Druid will never level 2.

3795
02:55:04,880 --> 02:55:05,240
No!

3796
02:55:08,930 --> 02:55:09,650
Look at this!

3797
02:55:09,750 --> 02:55:10,290
It's so great!

3798
02:55:10,550 --> 02:55:11,930
They just kind of stay there in place.

3799
02:55:13,730 --> 02:55:14,670
They're just chilling.

3800
02:55:17,910 --> 02:55:21,830
Have you considered putting the Druid attack speed boosters by the Superstorm once you get them?

3801
02:55:22,430 --> 02:55:23,170
Wait, what do you...

3802
02:55:26,190 --> 02:55:27,170
What do you mean?

3803
02:55:27,650 --> 02:55:28,770
Druid attack speed...

3804
02:55:28,770 --> 02:55:29,130
This one?

3805
02:55:29,310 --> 02:55:29,490
No.

3806
02:55:29,610 --> 02:55:31,250
This is the guy that goes crazy.

3807
02:55:34,290 --> 02:55:36,190
Is there like a sub-skill of this guy?

3808
02:55:37,370 --> 02:55:37,510
Is there like a sub-skill of this guy?

3809
02:55:37,510 --> 02:55:37,810
Or...

3810
02:55:41,130 --> 02:55:42,730
Is the bottom Druid...

3811
02:55:42,730 --> 02:55:42,950
Is the bottom Druid... It is?

3812
02:55:46,860 --> 02:55:47,720
Boost attack...

3813
02:55:47,720 --> 02:55:47,820
Oh!

3814
02:55:49,160 --> 02:55:50,320
Oh, we can!

3815
02:55:51,080 --> 02:55:52,380
I was about to put him down.

3816
02:55:52,460 --> 02:55:53,140
I'd be like...

3817
02:55:53,650 --> 02:55:54,800
We'll just add him now!

3818
02:56:00,700 --> 02:56:01,540
134, everybody!

3819
02:56:02,020 --> 02:56:02,520
134!

3820
02:56:03,020 --> 02:56:03,820
Pop lust!

3821
02:56:07,200 --> 02:56:08,020
We're half!

3822
02:56:08,180 --> 02:56:08,840
We're half!

3823
02:56:14,760 --> 02:56:15,400
Yes!

3824
02:56:15,700 --> 02:56:16,340
Yes!

3825
02:56:17,100 --> 02:56:17,420
Yes!

3826
02:56:18,700 --> 02:56:19,340
Yes!

3827
02:56:20,800 --> 02:56:21,160
Yes!

3828
02:56:21,680 --> 02:56:22,320
Yes!

3829
02:56:26,900 --> 02:56:28,340
Squidward on a chair!

3830
02:56:29,280 --> 02:56:29,300
Squidward on a chair!

3831
02:56:36,240 --> 02:56:37,200
Trying to get side by...

3832
02:56:40,240 --> 02:56:41,180
This is great!

3833
02:56:41,760 --> 02:56:44,020
Maybe I should put another glue guy here.

3834
02:56:45,040 --> 02:56:46,380
He'll glue all of them up.

3835
02:56:47,060 --> 02:56:48,120
Once they pop too.

3836
02:56:49,020 --> 02:56:50,140
Okay guys, hold on.

3837
02:56:50,180 --> 02:56:50,680
Don't judge me.

3838
02:56:53,460 --> 02:56:54,260
I'm just saying.

3839
02:56:54,720 --> 02:56:55,880
Wait, should he go here?

3840
02:56:58,160 --> 02:56:59,260
Yeah, he can reach.

3841
02:56:59,380 --> 02:56:59,920
He can reach.

3842
02:57:00,340 --> 02:57:00,740
Well...

3843
02:57:01,960 --> 02:57:02,720
Maybe... Hold on.

3844
02:57:02,760 --> 02:57:03,520
Where does this one reach?

3845
02:57:03,740 --> 02:57:04,940
This one reached in the bottom?

3846
02:57:05,140 --> 02:57:05,700
Kind of?

3847
02:57:06,740 --> 02:57:07,140
No!

3848
02:57:07,260 --> 02:57:07,880
I'm just...

3849
02:57:08,640 --> 02:57:09,040
Okay.

3850
02:57:09,240 --> 02:57:10,100
I won't go anymore.

3851
02:57:10,920 --> 02:57:12,480
He's just there for moral support.

3852
02:57:13,340 --> 02:57:14,480
I wasn't gonna...

3853
02:57:19,240 --> 02:57:19,680
Look!

3854
02:57:21,200 --> 02:57:21,940
We're so close!

3855
02:57:22,520 --> 02:57:23,260
We'll get there!

3856
02:57:23,460 --> 02:57:24,280
Where's my cursor?

3857
02:57:24,480 --> 02:57:24,880
Oh my god.

3858
02:57:24,900 --> 02:57:25,980
There's so much on this screen.

3859
02:57:26,060 --> 02:57:27,460
I can't even see my cursor at times.

3860
02:57:30,260 --> 02:57:30,700
Money?

3861
02:57:30,840 --> 02:57:31,180
Save?

3862
02:57:31,400 --> 02:57:32,020
We're saving!

3863
02:57:32,240 --> 02:57:32,480
We're saving!

3864
02:57:33,120 --> 02:57:33,880
It was 200!

3865
02:57:38,240 --> 02:57:40,380
Why are sometimes these so much faster?

3866
02:57:51,720 --> 02:57:52,080
Oh!

3867
02:57:52,500 --> 02:57:52,860
Oh!

3868
02:57:53,920 --> 02:57:54,280
Oh!

3869
02:57:55,280 --> 02:57:56,720
I just opened a new window!

3870
02:57:56,920 --> 02:57:57,540
Oh my gosh!

3871
02:57:58,540 --> 02:57:59,860
What the hell did I just open?

3872
02:57:59,980 --> 02:58:00,340
Oh!

3873
02:58:00,360 --> 02:58:02,380
I just opened the thing about Admiral C battles!

3874
02:58:06,240 --> 02:58:07,280
What did I miss?

3875
02:58:07,440 --> 02:58:08,060
Did I make it?

3876
02:58:08,160 --> 02:58:08,580
Did I win?

3877
02:58:12,080 --> 02:58:13,000
What was I doing?

3878
02:58:14,040 --> 02:58:15,720
I was gonna click some...

3879
02:58:15,720 --> 02:58:15,880
Oh!

3880
02:58:15,900 --> 02:58:16,600
I was gonna click this!

3881
02:58:17,140 --> 02:58:17,680
Hold on.

3882
02:58:17,740 --> 02:58:19,340
I gotta close out of this window.

3883
02:58:19,500 --> 02:58:19,680
Okay.

3884
02:58:19,700 --> 02:58:19,920
There we go.

3885
02:58:25,660 --> 02:58:26,020
Anyway...

3886
02:58:29,180 --> 02:58:29,540
Gosh!

3887
02:58:29,540 --> 02:58:31,260
Why do I have to take so much money?

3888
02:58:31,380 --> 02:58:32,140
Both of you!

3889
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:34,360
No!

3890
02:58:34,420 --> 02:58:34,540
No!

3891
02:58:37,380 --> 02:58:37,980
Unless... No!

3892
02:58:38,700 --> 02:58:39,060
No!

3893
02:58:40,200 --> 02:58:40,740
I'm loyal.

3894
02:58:41,480 --> 02:58:42,560
I'm loyal to the mission.

3895
02:58:52,900 --> 02:58:54,200
But I... Oh my god!

3896
02:58:54,300 --> 02:58:54,740
No!

3897
02:58:55,120 --> 02:58:55,680
I

3898
02:59:15,960 --> 02:59:20,780
wish I had filmed myself getting to 183 before so I can remember what I did.

3899
02:59:21,140 --> 02:59:21,600
No!

3900
02:59:24,560 --> 02:59:26,060
Budget busted your game.

3901
02:59:26,180 --> 02:59:26,620
I know!

3902
02:59:26,780 --> 02:59:28,460
Why is it so hard to get money?

3903
02:59:37,580 --> 02:59:38,140
Man...

3904
02:59:40,540 --> 02:59:41,980
Need more farms?

3905
02:59:41,980 --> 02:59:42,320
Yeah!

3906
02:59:42,360 --> 02:59:44,280
But farms cost a lot of money!

3907
02:59:50,650 --> 02:59:51,250
Hey!

3908
02:59:51,270 --> 02:59:51,530
Hey!

3909
02:59:51,570 --> 02:59:51,790
Hey!

3910
02:59:51,830 --> 02:59:52,810
Stop spamming!

3911
02:59:52,810 --> 02:59:53,870
Stop spamming!

3912
02:59:55,450 --> 02:59:56,170
It's okay.

3913
02:59:56,390 --> 02:59:57,210
Like I said.

3914
02:59:57,790 --> 02:59:58,390
It's...

3915
02:59:59,430 --> 03:00:00,590
It's... It's...

3916
03:00:00,590 --> 03:00:02,330
It's... It's...

3917
03:00:03,050 --> 03:00:03,910
What's the word?

3918
03:00:10,950 --> 03:00:11,550
Streaming...

3919
03:00:11,550 --> 03:00:12,250
Anxiety.

3920
03:00:12,470 --> 03:00:13,410
Performance anxiety!

3921
03:00:14,730 --> 03:00:15,330
No!

3922
03:00:15,330 --> 03:00:15,930
138!

3923
03:00:16,170 --> 03:00:16,750
Ewww!

3924
03:00:16,810 --> 03:00:17,690
We were so...

3925
03:00:17,790 --> 03:00:19,150
So far away from 200!

3926
03:00:24,830 --> 03:00:26,190
I tried...

3927
03:00:27,170 --> 03:00:28,930
I tried, you guys!

3928
03:00:29,510 --> 03:00:30,810
I'm not powerful enough!

3929
03:00:39,670 --> 03:00:41,170
I'll keep practicing.

3930
03:00:41,690 --> 03:00:43,110
I'll keep training.

3931
03:00:43,710 --> 03:00:44,790
And I'll...

3932
03:00:44,790 --> 03:00:45,470
I'll get it.

3933
03:00:45,510 --> 03:00:46,690
I'll get it next time.

3934
03:00:49,070 --> 03:00:52,310
If you had 140 to 138, that's way more than 200.

3935
03:00:59,680 --> 03:01:00,280
If you had 140 to 138, that's way more than 200.

3936
03:01:00,280 --> 03:01:01,120
You're right!

3937
03:01:01,780 --> 03:01:02,980
You guys!

3938
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:04,500
We did it!

3939
03:01:04,680 --> 03:01:05,640
You guys!

3940
03:01:05,760 --> 03:01:06,320
We did it!

3941
03:01:06,320 --> 03:01:08,300
We made it past 200!

3942
03:01:08,520 --> 03:01:08,680
We made it past 200!

3943
03:01:10,560 --> 03:01:11,720
Girl Math!

3944
03:01:13,020 --> 03:01:13,620
Yeah!

3945
03:01:15,060 --> 03:01:15,660
Yippee!

3946
03:01:18,040 --> 03:01:20,500
I don't want to use the free continue because...

3947
03:01:20,500 --> 03:01:21,980
I want to do it with a free continue.

3948
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:23,220
Without you having to use the continue.

3949
03:01:23,640 --> 03:01:25,680
I want to do it without dying at all.

3950
03:01:27,120 --> 03:01:28,400
Loon6 is on the summer sale.

3951
03:01:28,600 --> 03:01:28,860
Yeah!

3952
03:01:30,140 --> 03:01:31,820
Have some of the money I saved.

3953
03:01:33,280 --> 03:01:34,160
Thanks Rowland!

3954
03:01:34,220 --> 03:01:34,840
Thank you!

3955
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:36,800
Girl Math!

3956
03:01:37,300 --> 03:01:38,040
Girl Math!

3957
03:01:39,200 --> 03:01:40,080
I feel like... What?

3958
03:01:40,140 --> 03:01:40,900
We only played what?

3959
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:41,740
Two rounds?

3960
03:01:41,980 --> 03:01:42,260
Two rounds?

3961
03:01:43,340 --> 03:01:45,140
But that means... Or two games rather.

3962
03:01:45,360 --> 03:01:47,140
But that means our rounds were good.

3963
03:01:47,480 --> 03:01:49,240
Because we got... We got far.

3964
03:01:51,580 --> 03:01:52,020
Because...

3965
03:01:52,020 --> 03:01:53,600
We played for a couple of hours.

3966
03:01:53,700 --> 03:01:53,920
What's this?

3967
03:01:55,480 --> 03:01:56,040
Oh yeah!

3968
03:01:56,120 --> 03:01:56,800
I got an achievement.

3969
03:01:56,920 --> 03:01:58,900
For destroying 5000 ZOMGs.

3970
03:02:01,240 --> 03:02:02,120
Ghost Math!

3971
03:02:02,460 --> 03:02:02,720
Yeah!

3972
03:02:03,600 --> 03:02:05,620
Two games in three hours is kind of...

3973
03:02:06,180 --> 03:02:06,620
Crazy.

3974
03:02:08,060 --> 03:02:09,440
Because it's not that much at all.

3975
03:02:10,840 --> 03:02:12,100
It's not that much at all.

3976
03:02:16,060 --> 03:02:16,500
Oh!

3977
03:02:16,600 --> 03:02:17,860
At three actually...

3978
03:02:19,480 --> 03:02:20,040
You're right.

3979
03:02:20,800 --> 03:02:21,740
No that was just a...

3980
03:02:28,240 --> 03:02:29,660
Don't worry about it.

3981
03:02:31,400 --> 03:02:32,740
Don't worry about it.

3982
03:02:36,670 --> 03:02:37,590
Rounding error.

3983
03:02:37,910 --> 03:02:38,970
That even puts us...

3984
03:02:38,970 --> 03:02:40,470
Even higher above 200.

3985
03:02:41,470 --> 03:02:42,950
If you think about it.

3986
03:02:43,630 --> 03:02:44,890
So that makes us...

3987
03:02:44,890 --> 03:02:46,430
Basically at 300.

3988
03:02:48,870 --> 03:02:49,750
I think.

3989
03:02:53,340 --> 03:02:54,040
That's...

3990
03:02:54,040 --> 03:02:55,480
That's 318!

3991
03:02:56,160 --> 03:02:56,660
Yeah!

3992
03:03:01,440 --> 03:03:02,920
I might be the best.

3993
03:03:03,300 --> 03:03:04,300
That I ever was.

3994
03:03:06,900 --> 03:03:07,560
Sorry guys.

3995
03:03:11,140 --> 03:03:12,120
You can never...

3996
03:03:12,660 --> 03:03:14,720
You can only dream to get to my level.

3997
03:03:16,840 --> 03:03:18,900
If you factor in Ice Monkey it's at least 400.

3998
03:03:19,100 --> 03:03:19,460
So true.

3999
03:03:19,800 --> 03:03:20,960
Thanks for this fun stream.

4000
03:03:21,040 --> 03:03:22,420
Amazing job getting to round 300.

4001
03:03:22,780 --> 03:03:23,600
Thank you!

4002
03:03:29,120 --> 03:03:30,700
I would consider going longer.

4003
03:03:30,840 --> 03:03:31,120
But...

4004
03:03:32,100 --> 03:03:33,900
Since I have to get ready for my trip and stuff.

4005
03:03:34,980 --> 03:03:35,420
Umm...

4006
03:03:35,860 --> 03:03:37,160
I have some stuff to do.

4007
03:03:37,500 --> 03:03:38,800
I will end it here today.

4008
03:03:40,360 --> 03:03:41,600
200 or passed!

4009
03:03:44,220 --> 03:03:45,060
To be honest.

4010
03:03:45,320 --> 03:03:46,320
I'm a little frustrated.

4011
03:03:47,200 --> 03:03:48,480
Thanks for Bloons brain rot.

4012
03:03:48,540 --> 03:03:51,480
Just curious what anime you're looking forward to this month.

4013
03:03:52,440 --> 03:03:53,220
Nokotan and what?

4014
03:03:56,860 --> 03:03:57,560
Grandezer you.

4015
03:04:00,020 --> 03:04:01,140
You're gonna do what to me?

4016
03:04:03,360 --> 03:04:03,840
Nokotan.

4017
03:04:04,660 --> 03:04:05,860
I'll be honest.

4018
03:04:05,920 --> 03:04:07,220
I don't even know what's airing this month.

4019
03:04:08,060 --> 03:04:10,140
I'm behind on Blue Archive even.

4020
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:11,760
I'm behind.

4021
03:04:13,640 --> 03:04:14,600
I'm behind.

4022
03:04:15,980 --> 03:04:17,600
But I do want to watch Nokotan.

4023
03:04:17,760 --> 03:04:19,200
I'm interested in if it keeps...

4024
03:04:19,200 --> 03:04:20,720
You know how it has some of the...

4025
03:04:21,700 --> 03:04:22,180
Some...

4026
03:04:23,220 --> 03:04:23,840
Great marketing.

4027
03:04:23,960 --> 03:04:26,260
So I'm curious how the anime will be.

4028
03:04:26,880 --> 03:04:29,020
I hope it's like similar to Nichijou.

4029
03:04:30,760 --> 03:04:33,180
Shika no kono kono koko shi tan tan.

4030
03:04:33,400 --> 03:04:35,900
Shika no kono kono koko shi tan tan.

4031
03:04:36,180 --> 03:04:38,560
Shika no kono kono koko shi tan tan.

4032
03:04:38,880 --> 03:04:41,280
Shika no kono kono koko shi tan tan.

4033
03:04:42,160 --> 03:04:42,480
Shika no kono kono koko shi tan tan.

4034
03:04:42,500 --> 03:04:43,100
Wait.

4035
03:04:45,020 --> 03:04:47,460
Shika no kono kono koko shi tan tan.

4036
03:04:47,860 --> 03:04:50,100
Shika no kono kono koko shi tan tan.

4037
03:04:50,500 --> 03:04:50,880
Shika no kono kono koko shi tan tan.

4038
03:04:50,880 --> 03:04:52,660
Shika no kono kono koko shi tan tan.

4039
03:04:53,220 --> 03:04:55,360
Shikanoka no kanaka koshitan-tan!

4040
03:04:57,800 --> 03:04:58,960
Anyways, thank you guys!

4041
03:04:59,500 --> 03:05:01,600
I hope you guys had fun with Bloons.

4042
03:05:01,980 --> 03:05:06,760
As always, Bloons always brings out the crazy backseaters.

4043
03:05:07,020 --> 03:05:08,680
They're like, you guys are...

4044
03:05:11,100 --> 03:05:14,380
But it's fine, because I'm still learning, so it's okay.

4045
03:05:16,560 --> 03:05:18,340
What Bloons do you ship together?

4046
03:05:20,360 --> 03:05:22,600
All of my Sniper Monkeys.

4047
03:05:25,140 --> 03:05:26,220
Thanks for the stream, everybody!

4048
03:05:26,360 --> 03:05:26,820
It's my birthday!

4049
03:05:27,080 --> 03:05:27,840
Shionyus!

4050
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:29,000
Happy birthday!

4051
03:05:31,120 --> 03:05:34,680
Happy birthday to you!

4052
03:05:35,200 --> 03:05:38,400
Happy birthday to you!

4053
03:05:39,300 --> 03:05:42,420
Happy birthday, Shionyus!

4054
03:05:43,280 --> 03:05:47,260
Happy birthday to you!

4055
03:05:50,540 --> 03:05:51,400
Happy birthday!

4056
03:05:53,300 --> 03:05:55,040
Yeah, the Bloons community.

4057
03:05:55,580 --> 03:05:57,020
The Bloons community.

4058
03:05:57,360 --> 03:05:58,440
They're kind of crazy.

4059
03:05:59,520 --> 03:06:02,060
I'm just like, I'm just here to play monkey game.

4060
03:06:02,320 --> 03:06:05,140
And they're just like, more farms!

4061
03:06:05,620 --> 03:06:06,360
What are you doing?

4062
03:06:07,060 --> 03:06:11,240
I get it, I'm like trying to get to 200, but like...

4063
03:06:12,980 --> 03:06:16,000
But maybe we should calm down a little bit.

4064
03:06:17,220 --> 03:06:19,320
Why is the Ice Monkey on the chair?

4065
03:06:21,220 --> 03:06:22,840
Because that's where he belongs!

4066
03:06:23,800 --> 03:06:24,860
He's on vacation!

4067
03:06:25,660 --> 03:06:27,280
I need to match their energy.

4068
03:06:28,780 --> 03:06:31,360
If they start yelling at me, I need to yell back.

4069
03:06:32,520 --> 03:06:33,900
Why are you doing this?

4070
03:06:34,240 --> 03:06:35,540
Because I can!

4071
03:06:37,860 --> 03:06:40,800
BTD6 community is very emotionally invested.

4072
03:06:42,260 --> 03:06:43,180
So crazy.

4073
03:06:43,180 --> 03:06:44,560
It reminds me of like...

4074
03:06:44,560 --> 03:06:44,680
The...

4075
03:06:45,720 --> 03:06:46,900
The Cookie Run community.

4076
03:06:47,640 --> 03:06:51,840
I don't play Cookie Run, but I know that people get very serious about their cookies.

4077
03:06:52,540 --> 03:06:53,580
I don't understand.

4078
03:06:53,700 --> 03:06:56,620
What is it about baby games that makes people really crazy?

4079
03:07:00,180 --> 03:07:01,500
What is it?

4080
03:07:04,400 --> 03:07:05,860
Oh, you are a cookie now.

4081
03:07:06,060 --> 03:07:06,200
No!

4082
03:07:07,540 --> 03:07:08,800
Yeah, Cookie Run Kingdom.

4083
03:07:09,200 --> 03:07:10,140
That's what it's called, right?

4084
03:07:15,520 --> 03:07:17,720
Just play around with only Ice Monkey.

4085
03:07:21,700 --> 03:07:23,140
Baby games are serious business.

4086
03:07:24,180 --> 03:07:26,960
Do you think they get like this with like Candy Land and stuff?

4087
03:07:27,160 --> 03:07:27,560
Well, no.

4088
03:07:27,600 --> 03:07:30,940
I guess Candy Land is a little different.

4089
03:07:31,140 --> 03:07:34,340
There has to be an optimal way to play Candy Land.

4090
03:07:34,800 --> 03:07:35,620

4091
03:07:35,620 --> 03:07:36,080
Get out.

4092
03:07:40,860 --> 03:07:42,440
The monkeys are hotter?

4093
03:07:45,900 --> 03:07:46,840
And balloons?

4094
03:07:50,420 --> 03:07:51,840
Ice Monkey only stream.

4095
03:07:52,020 --> 03:07:53,840
Okay, we'll do Ice Monkey only next time.

4096
03:07:54,080 --> 03:07:55,940
Monkey business is serious business.

4097
03:07:56,160 --> 03:07:58,080
Next time we will 100%...

4098
03:07:58,080 --> 03:07:58,400
Well...

4099
03:07:59,720 --> 03:08:01,120
I'm not gonna guarantee that.

4100
03:08:01,200 --> 03:08:02,700
We will get to level 200.

4101
03:08:03,760 --> 03:08:06,200
We will do our best to get to level 200.

4102
03:08:06,200 --> 03:08:08,740
And we'll have an all Ice Monkey round.

4103
03:08:09,220 --> 03:08:10,240
Thanks for the fun stream.

4104
03:08:10,460 --> 03:08:10,900
Actually...

4105
03:08:12,400 --> 03:08:12,840
No.

4106
03:08:13,040 --> 03:08:14,500
I was gonna say, maybe I'll do it now.

4107
03:08:14,800 --> 03:08:16,440
But I gotta get my work done.

4108
03:08:18,060 --> 03:08:19,520
I gotta get my work done.

4109
03:08:21,580 --> 03:08:23,280
I was gonna do the Ice Monkey.

4110
03:08:23,460 --> 03:08:23,900
But it's okay.

4111
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:24,460
Next time.

4112
03:08:24,640 --> 03:08:25,240
Next time.

4113
03:08:26,460 --> 03:08:27,340
Next time.

4114
03:08:28,080 --> 03:08:28,520
Awesome!

4115
03:08:29,460 --> 03:08:30,140
Oh, wait.

4116
03:08:30,980 --> 03:08:31,780
I see...

4117
03:08:31,780 --> 03:08:33,300
I think the donations...

4118
03:08:33,300 --> 03:08:35,380
The stream lab donos are kinda backed up.

4119
03:08:36,460 --> 03:08:36,920
So...

4120
03:08:38,940 --> 03:08:40,660
I see Ice Monkeys!

4121
03:08:40,760 --> 03:08:41,440
Thank you!

4122
03:08:44,040 --> 03:08:44,960
Ice Monkeys!

4123
03:08:44,980 --> 03:08:45,420
I juggle?

4124
03:08:45,540 --> 03:08:45,940
Thank you!

4125
03:08:46,140 --> 03:08:46,760
Try Princess!

4126
03:08:46,860 --> 03:08:47,160
Thank you!

4127
03:08:47,660 --> 03:08:48,440
Jessie, thank you!

4128
03:08:49,060 --> 03:08:49,660
Mentioned already.

4129
03:08:49,860 --> 03:08:51,040
Have you seen anything about the...

4130
03:08:53,940 --> 03:08:56,360
The VSMP Minecraft server?

4131
03:08:57,180 --> 03:09:00,340
A ton of different indie and small corporal VTubers play on it.

4132
03:09:00,400 --> 03:09:01,340
I'm sure you could get in.

4133
03:09:01,580 --> 03:09:02,800
If that would interest you.

4134
03:09:03,060 --> 03:09:04,880
I was actually invited to...

4135
03:09:04,880 --> 03:09:05,480
Not that.

4136
03:09:05,700 --> 03:09:09,540
But Barry invited me to a GTA RP server.

4137
03:09:11,180 --> 03:09:12,680
Which I've never done before.

4138
03:09:12,860 --> 03:09:13,960
So I'm a little nervous.

4139
03:09:14,320 --> 03:09:15,440
I don't wanna...

4140
03:09:15,440 --> 03:09:17,640
If I'm not invited to something though...

4141
03:09:17,640 --> 03:09:18,520
I don't wanna like...

4142
03:09:18,520 --> 03:09:19,980
Force my way in.

4143
03:09:20,220 --> 03:09:20,760
So...

4144
03:09:20,760 --> 03:09:21,500
But...

4145
03:09:21,500 --> 03:09:24,520
I have seen that some people have been playing on a...

4146
03:09:24,520 --> 03:09:25,600
On a...

4147
03:09:26,300 --> 03:09:26,840
V...

4148
03:09:28,180 --> 03:09:28,720
M...

4149
03:09:28,720 --> 03:09:29,280
No.

4150
03:09:29,380 --> 03:09:29,680
V...

4151
03:09:29,680 --> 03:09:30,260
S...

4152
03:09:30,260 --> 03:09:31,500
I can't say this word.

4153
03:09:31,620 --> 03:09:31,880
V...

4154
03:09:31,880 --> 03:09:32,700
S...

4155
03:09:32,700 --> 03:09:33,180
M...

4156
03:09:33,180 --> 03:09:33,540
P...

4157
03:09:33,540 --> 03:09:33,940
Server.

4158
03:09:36,760 --> 03:09:37,200
So...

4159
03:09:37,820 --> 03:09:38,260
But...

4160
03:09:38,260 --> 03:09:38,600
I don't know.

4161
03:09:38,620 --> 03:09:40,580
I don't think I'll ever stream the GTA one.

4162
03:09:41,160 --> 03:09:41,600
But...

4163
03:09:41,600 --> 03:09:43,280
Maybe if you see some people...

4164
03:09:43,280 --> 03:09:44,760
If you watch some indie VTubers...

4165
03:09:44,760 --> 03:09:46,240
And you see that they're streaming it...

4166
03:09:46,240 --> 03:09:47,860
I might be in there...

4167
03:09:48,320 --> 03:09:48,760
Someday.

4168
03:09:48,820 --> 03:09:49,420
I don't know.

4169
03:09:51,860 --> 03:09:53,420
VTuber survival multiplayer.

4170
03:09:53,660 --> 03:09:54,540
Is that what it stands for?

4171
03:09:55,400 --> 03:09:56,440
I never knew.

4172
03:09:57,440 --> 03:09:58,640
I've only ever...

4173
03:09:58,640 --> 03:10:00,960
The first time I ever heard about it was from...

4174
03:10:00,960 --> 03:10:01,720
Dream.

4175
03:10:01,780 --> 03:10:01,860
Dream.

4176
03:10:01,860 --> 03:10:02,600
What is it?

4177
03:10:02,640 --> 03:10:03,680
The DS...

4178
03:10:04,520 --> 03:10:05,160
PM...?

4179
03:10:05,160 --> 03:10:05,960
No...

4180
03:10:05,960 --> 03:10:08,300
That's Deer Stage Perfect Music.

4181
03:10:11,320 --> 03:10:11,960
Oh!

4182
03:10:12,540 --> 03:10:13,180
SMP!

4183
03:10:13,660 --> 03:10:14,300
Sorry.

4184
03:10:14,420 --> 03:10:15,380
I don't know anything about Dream.

4185
03:10:31,090 --> 03:10:33,970
Get on the DSPM Minecraft server.

4186
03:10:35,550 --> 03:10:36,690
And Nan, thank you!

4187
03:10:36,870 --> 03:10:39,410
I see your anime recommendations, area 88.

4188
03:10:40,270 --> 03:10:41,270
Wait, that's old!

4189
03:10:41,590 --> 03:10:42,310
That's not new!

4190
03:10:46,150 --> 03:10:47,010
But thank you!

4191
03:10:50,410 --> 03:10:52,370
Oh wow, this duck, I just saw yours come in.

4192
03:10:52,610 --> 03:10:58,530
What you're saying is when Barry starts the server, we can expect a random cardboard box on the sidewalk from time to time?

4193
03:10:58,630 --> 03:10:58,950
Maybe!

4194
03:10:59,230 --> 03:11:00,170
If I have time.

4195
03:11:00,170 --> 03:11:02,490
She was like, no pressure!

4196
03:11:02,810 --> 03:11:08,430
And I was nervous because I've never done a server like that before.

4197
03:11:08,730 --> 03:11:13,370
I've never actually played GTA before either, so I'm just kind of like...

4198
03:11:13,370 --> 03:11:14,490
I don't know.

4199
03:11:17,870 --> 03:11:19,830
It's old, but it's good.

4200
03:11:20,110 --> 03:11:21,310
I hope you like it.

4201
03:11:21,390 --> 03:11:22,090
Thank you!

4202
03:11:25,090 --> 03:11:25,810
I don't know.

4203
03:11:25,890 --> 03:11:27,090
Nah, I've never played it.

4204
03:11:27,770 --> 03:11:30,150
If you guys are interested in me playing GTA...

4205
03:11:30,170 --> 03:11:31,090
I'll try it.

4206
03:11:31,890 --> 03:11:32,890
Because it looks fun.

4207
03:11:33,150 --> 03:11:36,170
I've never watched anyone play it before either because I...

4208
03:11:36,710 --> 03:11:39,330
was like, if I ever want to play it someday, I'll...

4209
03:11:40,990 --> 03:11:42,050
Not... I don't know.

4210
03:11:42,130 --> 03:11:43,030
Is that a game with spoilers?

4211
03:11:43,470 --> 03:11:45,910
I don't know anything about it, to be honest.

4212
03:11:49,390 --> 03:11:49,850
So...

4213
03:11:52,370 --> 03:11:53,490
Like single player?

4214
03:11:53,690 --> 03:11:54,510
Yeah, I guess so.

4215
03:11:54,510 --> 03:11:55,230
Yeah.

4216
03:11:58,790 --> 03:11:59,670
I don't know.

4217
03:12:03,310 --> 03:12:04,350
But anyway...

4218
03:12:06,570 --> 03:12:09,690
Reminds me of when you had GTA 5 on your final schedule a few years back.

4219
03:12:11,410 --> 03:12:12,690
All those years ago?

4220
03:12:14,090 --> 03:12:15,510
Why did I not do it?

4221
03:12:15,990 --> 03:12:17,950
I can't remember at all.

4222
03:12:19,930 --> 03:12:21,830
She's gonna run civilian over trust.

4223
03:12:22,690 --> 03:12:23,450
Yeah, probably.

4224
03:12:23,690 --> 03:12:24,950
Got a pretty good story mode?

4225
03:12:25,110 --> 03:12:25,710
No way, really?

4226
03:12:26,150 --> 03:12:26,950
Okay, cool.

4227
03:12:27,930 --> 03:12:28,890
Well guys, okay.

4228
03:12:30,430 --> 03:12:31,710
That's all tomorrow.

4229
03:12:32,130 --> 03:12:33,530
Finishing Metal Gear Solid 1.

4230
03:12:35,170 --> 03:12:35,610
And...

4231
03:12:36,370 --> 03:12:38,130
Yeah, I'm gonna go work on my stuff now.

4232
03:12:39,530 --> 03:12:42,130
I should have some like shorts that go up while I'm gone.

4233
03:12:42,810 --> 03:12:47,330
And also, if I can get this other video done, I'll have a special video.

4234
03:12:48,450 --> 03:12:49,750
A video that...

4235
03:12:50,370 --> 03:12:51,670
I'm kind of nervous about.

4236
03:12:51,670 --> 03:12:54,750
Because I've never put up this kind of video before.

4237
03:12:55,410 --> 03:12:55,890
So...

4238
03:12:58,810 --> 03:12:59,290
But...

4239
03:12:59,290 --> 03:12:59,810
Yeah.

4240
03:13:02,810 --> 03:13:05,070
I'm doing all the editing myself, so...

4241
03:13:07,290 --> 03:13:07,770
Anyway!

4242
03:13:08,710 --> 03:13:09,530
Anyway, anyway!

4243
03:13:10,210 --> 03:13:11,570
I will see you guys tomorrow.

4244
03:13:11,890 --> 03:13:14,410
And if not, I will see you guys the next time I catch you!

4245
03:13:15,070 --> 03:13:15,670
See you later!

4246
03:13:16,370 --> 03:13:16,850
Master!

4247
03:13:17,270 --> 03:13:17,730
Lady!

4248
03:13:19,010 --> 03:13:19,730
Bye bye!

4249
03:13:20,090 --> 03:13:20,570
Otsumita!

4250
03:13:20,570 --> 03:13:21,750
Bye bye!

4251
03:13:22,070 --> 03:13:22,910
Thank you guys!

4252
03:13:22,990 --> 03:13:23,530
Thanks for watching!

4253
03:13:24,210 --> 03:13:24,830
Bye bye!

4254
03:13:24,870 --> 03:13:25,210
Bye bye!

4255
03:13:25,250 --> 03:13:25,530
Bye bye!

4256
03:13:25,550 --> 03:13:25,930
Bye bye!

4257
03:13:26,110 --> 03:13:26,630
Bye bye!
