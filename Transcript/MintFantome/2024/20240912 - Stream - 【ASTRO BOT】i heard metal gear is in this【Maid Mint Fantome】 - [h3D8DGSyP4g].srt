1
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,450
Say what?

2
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,730
I am sleepy mint.

3
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,970
Double audio?

4
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,640
There we go.

5
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,240
I am astrobot.

6
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,560
Sleepy mint.

7
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,740
I am sleepy mint.

8
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,940
Sleepy mint.

9
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,720
Yeah!

10
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,000
I am sleepy mint.

11
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,600
Sleepy mint.

12
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,620
I am sleepy mint.

13
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,900
Sleepy mint.

14
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,660
Thank you for the 20 gift!

15
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,940
Astrobot.

16
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,140
Astrobot.

17
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,720
I am astrobot.

18
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,720
I am astrobot.

19
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,700
I am astrobot.

20
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:27,720
Ass.

21
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,860
Ass.

22
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,360
Ass.

23
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,860
Ass.

24
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:33,880
Astrobot.

25
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,000
I am astrobot.

26
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,640
He says it himself!

27
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,700
I am astrobot.

28
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,760
He says it himself!

29
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,180
Welcome back, master and madam!

30
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,640
If you're wondering why is Mintok so sleepy...

31
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,440
It's because I've been fighting the jet hag.

32
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,260
A.K.A.

33
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,280
Jet lag.

34
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,280
I'm ham!

35
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,060
From Japan!

36
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,600
And boy are my arms tired.

37
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,740
Thank you!

38
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,560
Jet lag is strong.

39
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,250
Happy birthday!

40
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,450
Happy birthday.

41
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,710
Happy birthday.

42
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,990
Happy birthday.

43
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,010
Happy birthday to Burly.

44
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,150
Happy birthday to you.

45
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,390
Welcome back, Mintok!

46
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,910
And you're

47
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,220
probably like, why is Mintok with Chibi if she's home?

48
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,140
Because I kind of got used to it.

49
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,860
But also I feel like Chibi looks good for this game, maybe.

50
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,780
I think.

51
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,800
Welcome to your house.

52
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,120
Thanks!

53
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,440
What a no sleepy girl.

54
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,220
Astrobot.

55
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,400
Thanks for the bird!

56
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,500
Glad you got to see a shoebill.

57
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,000
I know I was happy to see a serval in a zoo a few years ago.

58
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,340
I want to see serval!

59
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,180
I want to see friend!

60
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,220
I am...

61
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,140
I...

62
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,720
Yeah, I went to the zoo to see only the shoebill.

63
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,100
Luckily...

64
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,000
Luckily...

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,820
That was my main goal because I really didn't get to see much of anything else because the zoo was closing.

66
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,840
And Draco thanks for the turning of bird!

67
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,020
Did the shoebill eat you?

68
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,380
Does it look like you did?

69
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:02,970
I'm Astrobot.

70
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,190
Astro-bot.

71
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,370
I am Astro-bot.

72
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,450
I have Chibi energy.

73
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,670
I have no energy right now.

74
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,970
I took a nap earlier.

75
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,630
I didn't really do much but I think I made it worse, maybe.

76
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,110
I think I made it worse.

77
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,730
Astro-bot.

78
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,350
This song goes hard.

79
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,110
I could listen to it for like a whole hour.

80
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,630
Astro-bot.

81
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,790
I am Astro Bot.

82
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,010
I've seen so many good things about this game.

83
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,750
I'm ready to be Astro Bot.

84
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,250
I keep wanting to say Astro Boy.

85
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,330
Are you giving your cats a good scratch?

86
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,110
Yes!

87
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,990
They've been so cute.

88
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,990
My cats, I think they missed me a whole lot.

89
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,790
They were so cute.

90
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:08,950
Except today I scared Paz and she farted.

91
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:15,930
And the smell burnt into my nose for like the whole rest of the day.

92
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,350
And that wasn't good.

93
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,710
Happens to the best of us.

94
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,890
Have you ever been so spooked you farted?

95
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,290
That's my question.

96
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,550
Girl, that's my girl.

97
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,010
The chemical attack.

98
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,950
Deployed the chemical attack.

99
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,960
She smelt it.

100
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,720
She dealt it.

101
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,480
She had a natural reaction.

102
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,860
Like a real in the wild type of reaction you would expect, right?

103
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,400
How did you roll the two stinkiest cats ever?

104
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,100
How did you roll the two stinkiest cats ever?

105
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,900
I don't know.

106
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,980
Oh my god.

107
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,620
Wait, is that you Lamba Delta?

108
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,820
It's cut off.

109
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,700
All I see is lamb.

110
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,940
Thank you for the Okazoba.

111
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,620
Congratulations on beating Unmetal Gear.

112
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,780
Can't watch the stream when it's live because I have so much work to do.

113
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,940
I'm going to watch the VOD later to see the silliness of the game.

114
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,380
Can't wait for the hack and slash.

115
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,220
Unmetal Gear Rising Revengeance where you play as Jack Lightning.

116
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:35,860
No

117
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:41,740
worries.

118
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,420
If you can't watch, I appreciate watching the VOD.

119
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,440
My cat threw up all over the house and made me work late this morning.

120
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,980
Oh, I'm so sorry.

121
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,900
Infiltrate space and capture all the bots.

122
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,440
I actually don't know really anything about this game.

123
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:04,380
Just that there's like a bunch of like other game properties in it and I think that's fine.

124
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,340
So I'm excited to see.

125
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:07,980
I saw...

126
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,400
Not to like spoil so much.

127
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,400
But of course I knew that Metal Gear is in it.

128
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,100
I saw that Metal Gear is in this game.

129
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,440
And then I saw Katamari.

130
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
And that's basically all I know.

131
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,790
I don't really know what the...

132
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,290
I think it's a platformer, right?

133
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,590
I've never seen Escape from New York.

134
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,890
But I borrowed it from the library.

135
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,730
Let's see what Snake Pliss...

136
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,150
Oh my gosh.

137
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,350
Wait.

138
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,830
Escape from New York?

139
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,290
For some reason I wanted to say Attack from New York.

140
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,590
Escape from New York is so good.

141
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,010
The game is cute.

142
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,370
I'm excited to try it.

143
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,590
Let's try it.

144
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:54,970
I don't know how long I'll be able to stream today because my brain is really tired.

145
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,890
I am tired, Mint.

146
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:06,570
Now Mint has to prove how much of a hag she is with these retro games.

147
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,230
Oh boy.

148
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,570
Time to show my hag levels.

149
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,750
Oh cute.

150
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,790
It's even the memory card.

151
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:18,670
Oh stop.

152
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,470
Wait.

153
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,050
How retro are we getting?

154
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,950
It's so cute.

155
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:28,910
Oh my gosh.

156
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,910
The little wink here.

157
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,470
I like how Astro Bot just kind of became like the mascot.

158
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,330
Right?

159
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,270
I guess one memory card.

160
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,730
I think I still have mine somewhere.

161
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,430
I am Astro Bot.

162
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,030
Astro Bot.

163
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,890
This game is pretty.

164
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,010
Am I supposed to move anywhere?

165
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,930
This game is so pretty.

166
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,210
Oh wait.

167
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,090
That's a PS5.

168
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,650
Oh wow.

169
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,450
Let's party.

170
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,510
Like it's 1999.

171
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,280
Uh oh.

172
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,760
Oh and if you are wondering, I have not played the other Astro Bot games.

173
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,580
So this is my first one.

174
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,780
Oh my god.

175
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,540
He is...

176
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,940
Oh my god.

177
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,620
He is going to take it.

178
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,740
He is going to take everything from...

179
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,210
No.

180
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,530
That's my favorite part.

181
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:48,690
Oh.

182
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,890
The PS5.

183
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,550
Can Astro Bot breathe in space?

184
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,490
How is the audio by the way?

185
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,610
I think he just put that up his...

186
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,950
His hole.

187
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:15,790
Oh.

188
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,070
I think he just put...

189
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:23,010
He just stole that from us and put it up his hole.

190
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,490
Audio is good?

191
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,170
Thank you guys.

192
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,890
He stuck it up where?

193
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,950
That's what I'm saying.

194
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,470
Oh cute.

195
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,030
Oh my gosh.

196
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,470
It's like the controller I'm holding right now.

197
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,580
Cute.

198
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,890
I feel like this game would have been good for 3D huh?

199
00:12:59,390 --> 00:12:59,710
Oh!

200
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,870
He escaped.

201
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:05,770
Put it up.

202
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,370
He put it right in the...

203
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:09,950
Okay.

204
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,470
Oh my gosh.

205
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,370
Look how cute he is.

206
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,370
What else can we do?

207
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,090
We can jump.

208
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,830
We can fight.

209
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,030
Thank you, Link.

210
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,490
What else can we do?

211
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,790
Can I attack this thing?

212
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,890
I'm trying to pet him.

213
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,610
I'm trying to pet him.

214
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,790
Oh my gosh!

215
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,330
I'm so sorry!

216
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,110
That was an aggressive... it was like cuteness aggression, you know?

217
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,990
You sound like a monkey.

218
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,550
Oh wow!

219
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:12,950
Currency.

220
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,850
Oh wait, what?

221
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,330
Jump?

222
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,410
I did it!

223
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,230
Oh my gosh, I saw like this...

224
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,590
I saw like this TikTok the other day.

225
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,090
That was like...

226
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,210
It was titled like when you're... oh my god.

227
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,010
Is that a PSP?

228
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:41,170
It was like when you're... when you're teaching your girlfriend how to play a game.

229
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,970
But it really just felt like when a streamer is playing a game.

230
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,690
Because it was just like... it was the guy who was just like...

231
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,870
Okay, I'm gonna show you... I'm gonna show you Cuphead.

232
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,890
And she gets through... she's like playing the tutorial.

233
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,850
And then she's like...

234
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,190
She's like, why is it... why am I going against a boss so early?

235
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,570
And it's just like she doesn't know how to jump and dash.

236
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,390
I'm not explaining it very well.

237
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,330
But it's silly.

238
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,790
Everybody loves Ice Monkey.

239
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,130
Well, here's Astro Monkey.

240
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:15,650
Amatai.

241
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,350
Oh my god, he's dead!

242
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,130
Astro Bot is dead!

243
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:22,570
No!

244
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,110
I just started!

245
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,210
He has so many idle animations.

246
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,810
Oh, what else does he do?

247
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,650
He's so cute!

248
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:32,810
Ah!

249
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:33,550
He's dead!

250
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,130
Rip Bozo.

251
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,430
Okay.

252
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,310
Anyway.

253
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,490
Anyway, just that... that part reminded me of the video I watched.

254
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,790
That's all I was trying to say.

255
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,590
Oh my gosh, look at the trails it leaves in the sand.

256
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,630
It has... it's so... it looks so...

257
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:00,990
It's so good!

258
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,190
Oh my gosh.

259
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,110
It feels like forever since I've played like a...

260
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,810
I don't know.

261
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,590
Would you call it...

262
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,050
I don't...

263
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,990
I wouldn't call it maybe...

264
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,430
I don't know.

265
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,470
A triple A title.

266
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,190
But like it's been so long since I've played like a...

267
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:19,830
A big game that has like a high budget and it's come out recently.

268
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,090
So I'm like not used to high graphics right now.

269
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,630
You know what I mean?

270
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,890
You know what I mean?

271
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,070
No!

272
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:27,610
Oh my gosh!

273
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,090
He waved!

274
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:28,770
So cute!

275
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,330
Yeah!

276
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,210
A modern game?

277
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:32,550
Yeah!

278
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,450
So for me, I'm just like wow!

279
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,890
Attention to detail!

280
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,110
So cool!

281
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:44,870
It's so high def!

282
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,490
Hey!

283
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,890
Oh my gosh!

284
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,710
I didn't think hitting him would actually work.

285
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,750
Beep boop bop!

286
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,550
Beep beep beep beep!

287
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,860
Yeah!

288
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:03,980
So cute!

289
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,120
I want my own...

290
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,220
Oh!

291
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:06,920
What am I doing?

292
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:07,700
Oh!

293
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,800
Controller sounds, etc.

294
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,840
mimic on what you walk on.

295
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,840
Welcome back, Minto.

296
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,540
Thanks, Chucky!

297
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,140
No way!

298
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,920
Well, actually I can't really hear the controller sounds because of my headphones.

299
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,720
I don't know if you guys can.

300
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,240
I'm holding it close to the mic right now.

301
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,740
Where do we go?

302
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,460
Oh!

303
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,260
Scan...

304
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,480
Or boost...

305
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,780
Where do we go?

306
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,520
Chameleon?

307
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,280
I think we have to go to monkey.

308
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,460
Gorilla Nebula!

309
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,680
Okay!

310
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Wait, hold on.

311
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,860
What's the boost do?

312
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,260
Wow!

313
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,160
Oh!

314
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,840
Wow!

315
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,120
The trigger feels so good!

316
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,320
Sorry, I probably sound like I'm shilling this.

317
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,360
It just all feels so new!

318
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:08,900
I'm so excited!

319
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,820
I've played too many retro games recently.

320
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,520
Aaaaah!

321
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:20,780
No!

322
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,280
Pew pew pew pew!

323
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,000
Okay, here we go.

324
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,220
Dive in!

325
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,540
Oh my gosh, I saw flamingos at the zoo recently!

326
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,600
There was like this one flamingo that was...

327
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,260
Okay, all the flamingos were pink, you know?

328
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:38,880
Flamingos are pretty cute.

329
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,960
They're pink because they eat shrimp.

330
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,420
That's where they get their pink color from.

331
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,540
But there was one flamingo that was gray.

332
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,820
And I was like, is he sick?

333
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,360
Or is he... I don't know.

334
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,880
I was like, what's wrong with...

335
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,660
Or maybe he's a baby flamingo.

336
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,500
And...

337
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,620
And...

338
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,320
And...

339
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,020
They were like... there was like...

340
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,420
They were doing like a mating ritual or something.

341
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,800
Unless he's a baby.

342
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,780
But I got it all on camera.

343
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,180
And I was like, me and who?

344
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,620
Are we diving in?

345
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,980
Oh, I have to hold it down.

346
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,480
There we go!

347
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,420
First level, let's go!

348
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,100
They're so pink here.

349
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,280
Oh, this is how I move.

350
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:22,600
Okay.

351
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,160
We're coming in hot!

352
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,400
We're coming in hot!

353
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,760
Oh, it's just like Outer Wilds.

354
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,180
What's this?

355
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,520
Yeah!

356
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Okay, punch the trees!

357
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,220
Yeah, punch the trees!

358
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,320
Trees ain't got nothing on me!

359
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,140
Bitcoin!

360
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,080
I'm gonna punch these guys.

361
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,120
Oh, are you a friend?

362
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,720
I think...

363
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,080
I think he was a friend.

364
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,380
Okay, I think I gotta get up here.

365
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,560
And get... I don't know...

366
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,640
Quite the point...

367
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,640
The point of the coins yet, but...

368
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,260
Depth perception?

369
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,580
How many shrimps do you have to eat before he makes your skin turn pink?

370
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,180
Eat too much and I'll get sick.

371
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,360
Shrimps are pretty rich.

372
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,540
What is this a reference to?

373
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,250
Yeah...

374
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,260
A song?

375
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,000
What song?

376
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:52,880
What song?

377
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,460
It's an old song.

378
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,580
You haven't heard flamingo?

379
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,180
I guess not.

380
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,000
Oh!

381
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,600
This guy is trying to steal my loot!

382
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,700
Yeah!

383
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,080
Take that, idiot!

384
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,720
This is what you get for trying to steal from me.

385
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,990
Wait... wait...

386
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,040
I guess I could have gone this way, huh?

387
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,320
Whatever...

388
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,760
I think I got everything.

389
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,640
He's so cute.

390
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,120
He's yelling...

391
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,100
to nobody.

392
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,700
Anybody who will listen to him talk.

393
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,640
You said it's yours.

394
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,840
It's my money now!

395
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,180
Yeah?

396
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,360
Oh!

397
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,550
I rescued a bot!

398
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,430
Oh

399
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,880
my gosh!

400
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:00,760
Wait!

401
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,760
That's so cool!

402
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,040
I'm actually controlling it!

403
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,740
You can see me pushing the buttons even!

404
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,780
It's like nipples!

405
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,560
Yeah!

406
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,140
Okay.

407
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,740
What's this?

408
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,230
I'll take that.

409
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,070
I'll take that.

410
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:29,730
Attack!

411
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:30,570
Attack!

412
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:31,450
Oh!

413
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,150
Evil!

414
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:32,510
Evil!

415
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:32,770
Evil!

416
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,110
Evil!

417
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,210
Evil!

418
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,350
Yeah.

419
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,350
Oh my gosh!

420
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,510
We're restoring the planet!

421
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,890
I have to beat these guys up to rescue them.

422
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:42,570
It's so sad.

423
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:43,530
Oh!

424
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,250
Yeah!

425
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,990
Yeah!

426
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:47,670
Yeah!

427
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,070
Yeah!

428
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,750
You guys like it in there?

429
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,250
You guys like it in there?

430
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,830
I've gone mad with power!

431
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:06,250
I've gone mad with power!

432
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,550
I have Shaken Bot Syndrome, maybe.

433
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,690
What's this?

434
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:17,330
Oh!

435
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:17,710
Yoshi!

436
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:21,250
Take that!

437
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:22,690
Take that!

438
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,610
We can even play some football!

439
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:26,810
Yeah!

440
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,790
Screw you!

441
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,980
One jerk ruins it for everybody.

442
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,340
One jerk ruins it for everybody.

443
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:38,660
One jerk ruins it for everybody.

444
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,660
There's a secret ball!

445
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,070
Okay.

446
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,400
Let's grab this.

447
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,160
Wait!

448
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,300
This is so fun already!

449
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:06,980
Wow!

450
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,120
Wee!

451
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,440
Is this like a checkpoint, I'm guessing?

452
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,080
Oh!

453
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,180
Fun!

454
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:18,560
Come on!

455
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,720
Destroy!

456
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,660
Whoa!

457
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,560
Yeah!

458
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,090
This is so nice after...

459
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,030
After having played...

460
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,930
What's it called?

461
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,050
Mario 64.

462
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,390
It feels so good!

463
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,170
Okay.

464
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,710
Square and pole!

465
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,700
Is that guy yelling up there?

466
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:00,590
Wait!

467
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:01,670
Is that...

468
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,030
Ratchet?

469
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,060
Is that Ratchet?

470
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,260
Tooled up mechanic!

471
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,360
He's tooled up!

472
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,420
I'm boggling them.

473
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,540
His little buddy's got his back.

474
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:23,860
He's cute!

475
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,540
Oh my gosh!

476
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:25,860
Wait!

477
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,340
You guys, when we find Snake, I might cry!

478
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,360
What am I doing?

479
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,540
Oh!

480
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,840
I hold up.

481
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,520
I power up.

482
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:34,860
Pshh!

483
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,680
Oh my god!

484
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,220
I might cry when we see him.

485
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:43,960
Oh!

486
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:46,790
Cute!

487
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,430
It's a water slide!

488
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:49,910
Wait!

489
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,430
There we go!

490
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,670
Wait, did I get everything?

491
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,870
You think I got everything, you guys?

492
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,910
No coins left behind?

493
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,850
Sorry, I'm a bit of a hoarder.

494
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,690
I must collect everything?

495
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,050
I must collect everything?

496
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:05,050
Oi!

497
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:05,910
Oi!

498
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:08,530
Oi!

499
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,190
Oi!

500
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,590
Here we go!

501
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:16,800
Oh gosh, the turtle's chasing after me!

502
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,860
Baby girl!

503
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,360
Thanks for the ball, I'm gifted.

504
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,920
What's going on in here?

505
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,880
What's going on in here?

506
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,380
How do I dive?

507
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,840
Um...

508
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,620
Oh, there we go.

509
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,620
Just jump in.

510
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,220
Jump on in, the water's fine.

511
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,180
The water's good.

512
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,620
Best water slide.

513
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,700
That was nice.

514
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,620
Oh!

515
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,960
I'm powering up!

516
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:48,340
Oooh!

517
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:49,920
Ah!

518
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,020
Oh!

519
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,800
Oh!

520
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,100
Did this just say secret?

521
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,460
Wait!

522
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:04,880
That's right.

523
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,560
That's right.

524
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,860
Oh my gosh, wait!

525
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,320
I think I have to...

526
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,040
There we go.

527
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:15,860
Yeah!

528
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,740
Yeah!

529
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,070
Shake your booty!

530
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,330
Shake your booty!

531
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:24,990
Yeah?

532
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,320
Multiversal rebel.

533
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,180
A Lombax from another dimension?

534
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,020
Riveting!

535
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,680
Rivet.

536
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,100
I like playing with them.

537
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,720
I like playing with them.

538
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,820
It's pretty fun.

539
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,960
Alright, cool.

540
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,680
Oi!

541
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:52,900
Oi!

542
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,440
Rivet.

543
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,380
Riveting.

544
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,340
What is rivet from?

545
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,020
Is it also Ratchet and Clank?

546
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,780
Is it also Ratchet and Clank?

547
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,980
I actually haven't played that series, so...

548
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:13,800
Um...

549
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,840
Oh!

550
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,010
Hold on, these guys are...

551
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,910
Ruining the mood!

552
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,290
Get out of here.

553
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:25,890
Oh!

554
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:28,890
Oh!

555
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,150
A one...

556
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,370
A two!

557
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,250
They're fun, you know?

558
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,270
Would recommend.

559
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,970
This is so cute.

560
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,550
Look at our little guy!

561
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,010
He's so cute!

562
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,570
He's just running all around!

563
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:52,370
Oh!

564
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,670
Hold

565
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,770
on, we'll get...

566
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:02,630
Wow!

567
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,490
Yeah, that's right.

568
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:09,690
You think you can mess with my money?

569
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,790
You think you can mess with my money?

570
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:14,470
You think you can mess with my money?

571
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:14,550
You think you can mess with my money?

572
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,490
What about Jak and Daxter?

573
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,030
Actually, I never played that one either.

574
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,710
Yeah, I never played that one either.

575
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:23,390
Actually.

576
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,050
This guy, he's also ruining the mood.

577
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,470
Oi!

578
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:29,950
Oi!

579
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:30,370
Oi!

580
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:30,850
Oi!

581
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:31,130
Oi!

582
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:34,410
I

583
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,210
think I jump and...

584
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,800
Do I jump over...

585
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,320
Okay, no.

586
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:04,880
I think I...

587
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,100
Maybe I do jump over.

588
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,560
This is a big old taco!

589
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,020
Is there a guy in here?

590
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,820
They were trying to bury him alive, for real.

591
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,820
They were trying to bury him alive, for real.

592
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,160
What?

593
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:34,840
Wait, what?

594
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,380
Oh!

595
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:36,860
Oh!

596
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,420
Oh!

597
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,180
Oh!

598
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,280
Oh!

599
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:41,960
Oh!

600
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:42,260
Oh!

601
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:42,680
Oh!

602
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:42,920
Oh!

603
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,000
Oh!

604
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,560
Oh!

605
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,480
I didn't know it was that kind of game.

606
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:47,860
I didn't know it was that kind of game.

607
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,280
I didn't know it was that kind of game.

608
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:58,740
Wait, so...

609
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,300
Can I still attack Lime?

610
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,360
Oh, come on!

611
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:02,740
Grab it!

612
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,160
Yeah!

613
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,800
We got it!

614
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,900
It's like Kirby.

615
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:08,580
It's like Kirby.

616
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,750
I was gonna say...

617
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,710
But Kirby makes like a cuter noise.

618
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,190
But I was thinking of actually...

619
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,250
What's his name?

620
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:21,430
Um...

621
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,570
Oh my gosh!

622
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:24,550
I keep...

623
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,570
Sorry, I'm so tired.

624
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:26,570
Sorry, I'm so tired.

625
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,170
I keep wanting to say Luigi!

626
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,930
But that's not who!

627
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,810
Yoshi!

628
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,690
Wait, can I climb up this?

629
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,150
Can I grab this and climb?

630
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,580
Um, Yoshi!

631
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,440
You know how Yoshi goes...

632
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,350
Can I wall jump?

633
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,510
Okay, I have to...

634
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,850
I have to inflate.

635
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,930
Oh yeah, that skill that I just learned, right?

636
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,140
I don't actually...

637
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,280
I don't remember what sound...

638
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,320
I should probably be punching these trees, huh?

639
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,120
I don't remember what sound...

640
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:12,940
Um...

641
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,180
Uh...

642
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,660
Kirby makes.

643
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,340
Oh!

644
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,820
Oh!

645
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,380
Oh!

646
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:34,340
Oh!

647
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:34,960
Gosh!

648
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,680
There's so much hidden in here!

649
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,740
For real!

650
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,840
There's so much hidden in here!

651
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,080
For real!

652
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,420
There's so much hidden in here!

653
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,700
Is this a boss?

654
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,360
Oh no!

655
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,480
I think it's a boss!

656
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,580
Oh no!

657
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:50,610
I think it's a boss!

658
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:50,690
Oh!

659
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,040
Alright, here we go!

660
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,100
Maybe?

661
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,160
Oh!

662
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:00,940
Oh!

663
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,620
Who's in here?

664
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:01,840
Ah!

665
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,420
You're welcome!

666
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,460
I know, I'm so good at my job.

667
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,700
I'm gonna punch you.

668
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,560
Get in my controller.

669
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,780
Get in my controller so I can...

670
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,180
Bobble you around.

671
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,000
Yeah!

672
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,620
Yeah, you like that?

673
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:20,960
Yeah!

674
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,140
Yeah!

675
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,560
Ooh!

676
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,340
Oh my gosh!

677
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,800
Eww!

678
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,820
Do you see how it's like...

679
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,160
So jelly!

680
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:32,560
Delicious!

681
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:35,940
Oh!

682
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,460
So yummy!

683
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,360
Okay.

684
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,940
I'm glad we're a robot.

685
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,780
We don't have to breathe.

686
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,400
What's in here though?

687
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,180
Giant shadows that I'm seeing.

688
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:47,720
I'm scared.

689
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,740
I'm scared of them.

690
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,260
Here we go!

691
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,000
We're gonna go up!

692
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,200
We're gonna go up towards the shadows!

693
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,160
Oh!

694
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,240
Oh!

695
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,540
Oh!

696
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:58,920
Oh!

697
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,240
Oh!

698
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,620
Oh!

699
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:00,840
Oh!

700
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,540
Oh!

701
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:01,620
Oh!

702
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:02,840
Chat,

703
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,680
don't back, Xander.

704
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,160
Yeah, if I miss stuff, that's okay.

705
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,500
It's my first time playing, you know?

706
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,720
I'm not gonna get everything.

707
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,180
That's a-okay, baby.

708
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,740
Third piece!

709
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:16,600
Woo!

710
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,480
I don't know what that means, but...

711
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,000
Probably means I'm really good at this game.

712
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,440
Except snake.

713
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,620
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

714
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,240
Except snake.

715
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,260
Yahoo!

716
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,280
Woohoo!

717
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,260
How dare you make mistakes, VTuber!

718
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,040
Um, but I do wanna...

719
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,560
Is it a game where...

720
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,480
If you don't collect all the bots...

721
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,520
Like, you collect all the bots, right?

722
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,120
What's going on in here?

723
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,040
What's going on in here?

724
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,080
Oh, wait.

725
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,520
Oh!

726
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,980
I think I just...

727
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,280
Oh, I missed a guy!

728
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:07,720
Wait.

729
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,380
Hold on.

730
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,140
Yeah.

731
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,100
I gotta get the...

732
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,080
I missed a man!

733
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,280
We can't go through there yet!

734
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,340
Hold on.

735
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:19,860
Um...

736
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,900
Where was he?

737
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,460
That's what we were saying, yeah.

738
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,720
I mean, like I said...

739
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,540
I'm gonna miss some stuff.

740
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,360
It's okay.

741
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:29,540
Um...

742
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,500
Is there fall damage?

743
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,860
Oh, it actually won't let me.

744
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,840
Okay, let's go back in.

745
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,100
Maybe down here?

746
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,940
Oh, no, no, no!

747
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,760
I'm punching everything?

748
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,240
Is he in the logs?

749
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,230
Is he in this chicken?

750
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,170
Is he up there?

751
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,310
Is he up there?

752
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:15,780
Is he up there?

753
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,160
I see nothing.

754
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,040
Oh!

755
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,860
Oh my god!

756
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,680
Oh!

757
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,420
Well, there's...

758
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:23,840
Eww!

759
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,720
This cranium.

760
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:28,940
Uh...

761
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,380
Well, anyways.

762
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,640
It's a good thing I came over here.

763
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,800
So I can get all the coins.

764
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,540
At least.

765
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,560
Yeah, I hate...

766
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,300
...petals.

767
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,580
Yeah, I hate... This place is...

768
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,080
...too beautiful.

769
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,160
Need to ugly it up a little bit.

770
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,440
You're hoarding all the...

771
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,920
...beautiful petals for yourselves.

772
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,880
It's not very kind of you.

773
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,320
I think there's something up on this tree.

774
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,640
And I think...

775
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,480
...it's our...

776
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,420
...little guy!

777
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,460
Oh!

778
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,240
There's another one!

779
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,520
There's another...

780
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,080
Oh my gosh.

781
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,360
Fly higher!

782
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,120
Fly higher!

783
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,740
Oh wait, I think I know what to do.

784
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,320
Astro what?

785
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,120
Okay, here we go.

786
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,340
And then from here...

787
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,060
...we float!

788
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,920
Yeah!

789
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:28,900
Oh!

790
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:29,920
Um...

791
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:32,830
There we go!

792
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,790
I'm kind of a genius.

793
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,410
If I have to say so myself.

794
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:38,930
Look at the...

795
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,590
...like the blurring of the background.

796
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,090
Okay, where the heck is this guy?

797
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,470
Am I blind?

798
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,370
Am I blind?

799
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:49,930
Where is he?

800
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,310
Little guy!

801
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:56,530
Little guy!

802
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:57,250
Little guy!

803
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,420
It's just the first level, please.

804
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:06,620
It's just the first level, please.

805
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,280
Be really obvious.

806
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,540
Yeah, I'm blind!

807
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,360
Can you guys give me a hint?

808
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,180
In the water with the turtle?

809
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,120
Oh!

810
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,040
He's right...

811
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,420
Oh!

812
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,140
He was swimming!

813
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,040
Of course I didn't notice him.

814
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:24,920
Alright, get in there.

815
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,300
There we go.

816
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,840
I was too busy paying attention to the turtle!

817
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,160
Alright.

818
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:31,800
Now we're good.

819
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,840
That guy was living his best life actually.

820
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,220
I don't think we rescued him at all.

821
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,460
He looked like he was really enjoying himself.

822
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,660
He wasn't in danger at all!

823
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,840
He looked like he was really enjoying himself.

824
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,700
In fact, he seemed perfectly fine.

825
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,160
Yeah, I'm ruining their day for real.

826
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,560
Alrighty.

827
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,380
Now, we can continue onward.

828
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:02,880
Now, we can continue onward.

829
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,580
Yippee!

830
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,080
Here

831
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,760
we go into... whatever this thing is.

832
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,480
Oh wait, before we do that...

833
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,820
Secret door.

834
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,620
Nothing.

835
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,420
Here.

836
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,900
Okay.

837
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,860
Yeah, this is our land now.

838
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,240
Yeah, stupid fish.

839
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,990
Planet conquered.

840
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,780
Was he just flossing?

841
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,380
What's that?

842
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,020
Wait, what's that?

843
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,240
Oh.

844
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:35,450
I didn't think I was gonna blast off like crazy like that.

845
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,070
You know what?

846
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:38,530
That's okay.

847
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:44,690
Do we want to go to Ice Cream World or do we want to go to Aztec Trail?

848
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:48,910
Creamy Canyon.

849
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,490
Ice cream?

850
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:53,870
I scream?

851
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:54,990
You scream?

852
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,610
We all scream for ice cream!

853
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,630
Aztec looks very crash.

854
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:04,410
Yes, it does.

855
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,810
What if I just miss the landing?

856
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:08,710
Nevermind.

857
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,410
I never miss.

858
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,190
Oh.

859
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:13,630
Oh!

860
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,050
Hi!

861
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:14,770
Hi!

862
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,200
Hi!

863
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:20,900
Oh.

864
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,180
There's balls everywhere.

865
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,260
I have to dig for treasure and stuff.

866
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,680
Nom nom nom.

867
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:29,820
I can't believe it.

868
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:29,820
I can't believe it.

869
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:29,820
I can't believe it.

870
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:29,820
I can't believe it.

871
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:29,820
I can't believe it.

872
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:29,820
I can't believe it.

873
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:29,820
I can't believe it.

874
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,980
Nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom...

875
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,380
I wanna eat all of this!

876
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,400
Is that...

877
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,900
through my eyes?

878
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,360
Is that...

879
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,820
Come here.

880
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,640
Come here you're...

881
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,080
Come here you're... Come here!

882
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:58,940
Come

883
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,180
here!

884
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,240
Come here!

885
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,040
Come here!

886
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,360
Wait, where is he?

887
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,760
Oh there he is.

888
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,280
Come out!

889
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,660
Come out!

890
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,620
Snake, come out!

891
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,660
Get out of your cage!

892
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,160
Get out of your cage, Snake!

893
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,100
Come here.

894
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:41,640
Come here.

895
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,660
I just wanna look at you.

896
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,540
No, don't hide from me!

897
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,240
Don't hide from me!

898
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:46,800
I'm good.

899
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,160
I'm calm.

900
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:50,760
Don't hide.

901
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,160
Don't hide.

902
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:51,500
It's okay.

903
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,260
He's so cute.

904
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,140
Can I dump him out?

905
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,360
Come out.

906
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:55,880
Snake.

907
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:56,980
Get out of there.

908
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,900
Snake, open up.

909
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,800
Let me into your heart.

910
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,180
Look, he's waving at me!

911
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:08,630
Come out.

912
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,190
Okay.

913
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:12,830
Was a terrible child is such a good tag.

914
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,130
Stop traumatizing him!

915
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,250
You're scaring him.

916
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,720
Oh no!

917
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,480
Our bot's cold!

918
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:29,400
What's this?

919
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:34,900
Yeah!

920
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,180
Oh, what's this?

921
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,020
Oh!

922
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,220
Fine.

923
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,040
Okay, so we gotta get... See?

924
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:42,740
It's good that...

925
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,460
I'm eating everything.

926
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,100
Oh, I gotta push him over.

927
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:50,680
Push.

928
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,420
Push him into here.

929
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:53,940
There we go!

930
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,860
Okay, but first...

931
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,580
The music slowed down.

932
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,320
Oh, okay.

933
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:00,640
I'm eating.

934
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:01,680
I'm eating.

935
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,180
I'm eating.

936
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:02,540
I'm eating.

937
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:02,900
I'm eating.

938
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:03,260
I'm eating.

939
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:03,620
I'm eating.

940
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:03,980
I'm eating.

941
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:04,060
I'm eating.

942
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:04,320
I'm eating.

943
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:04,700
I'm eating.

944
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,860
Gotta eat everything, you guys.

945
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:08,640
You never know.

946
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,520
Where did our ship go?

947
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,540
I'm basically just mowing the lawn.

948
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,540
If you think about it.

949
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,380
What's up there?

950
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:28,860
Oh, wait!

951
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,780
Wait, can I get you back out?

952
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,180
Can you come here?

953
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:32,840
Real quick?

954
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,560
Hey, stop bullying him!

955
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,540
Oh, I wanna go up there.

956
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,160
I missed my opportunity.

957
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:48,820
Dang it.

958
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,140
Dang it.

959
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,000
Stop bullying him kills him?

960
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,220
He...

961
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:00,380
He...

962
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,300
He was a wimp.

963
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,760
What can I say?

964
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,320
Psycho

965
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,200
Mantis!

966
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:20,920
Wait, give it back!

967
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,420
Give it back!

968
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,320
Give back Psycho Mantis!

969
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:35,930
You knew

970
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:41,390
Metal Gear was here.

971
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:44,010
You guys know me so well.

972
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:44,290
You know me so well.

973
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,350
I know we're like trying to get to you.

974
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:51,930
Oops.

975
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:53,930
Oh my gosh.

976
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:55,470
Platforming time!

977
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,940
Okay, now we have to like actually get him.

978
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:04,620
Look at him go!

979
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,140
I just wanted some ice cream.

980
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,220
Stop being so tsundere, you guys.

981
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,220
Stop being

982
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:24,480
so tsundere, you guys.

983
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,060
Look at them together.

984
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,060
Snake's enjoying it though.

985
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,840
He's like...

986
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,560
Oh, sorry.

987
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:38,930
They're so cute!

988
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:40,030
Oh my gosh.

989
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:44,410
What is Snake doing actually?

990
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,790
Why is he thrusting his hips like that?

991
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,220
Come out.

992
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,700
Come on.

993
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,440
Get out of there.

994
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,340
Guys, I think I'm enjoying this game a little too much.

995
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,960
I think I'm having a little bit too much fun.

996
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,140
What

997
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,580
are those?

998
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,000
There's mushrooms.

999
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,920
And they glow.

1000
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,040
I'm not done clearing the land.

1001
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,060
You can flip once I'm telling you to.

1002
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,000
You can't!

1003
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,060
Snow mushrooms.

1004
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:57,680
Mint.

1005
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,440
That's me!

1006
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,500
Hello!

1007
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,040
I feel like I missed some stuff over here though, right?

1008
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,140
We were so preoccupied with...

1009
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:06,940
Wait!

1010
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,020
I can get to it from here, can't I?

1011
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:09,700
Probably.

1012
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,380
Okay, I hope I don't die!

1013
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,100
How

1014
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,670
can I check?

1015
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:37,490
I guess I still have him because...

1016
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:43,350
Because I don't see him being flown around.

1017
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:44,830
Oops.

1018
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:58,570
What?

1019
00:48:58,650 --> 00:48:59,010
Press S?

1020
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:00,350
Oh!

1021
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:01,010
No!

1022
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:02,190
Skip!

1023
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:02,550
Skip!

1024
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:02,810
Skip!

1025
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:07,740
Oh!

1026
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:08,940
Options.

1027
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,660
There he is.

1028
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,100
I accidentally pressed the...

1029
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,640
The playstation...

1030
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,520
The big button in the middle.

1031
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,630
See, these look breakable, right?

1032
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:25,370
What do you mean?

1033
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:30,210
You think now I'll make it?

1034
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:30,850
Yeah.

1035
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:32,850
Probably.

1036
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,090
From here.

1037
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:35,830
Nevermind.

1038
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,560
Maybe off the ladybug?

1039
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,360
Maybe the ladybug...

1040
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,500
Is the key.

1041
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:51,660
No!

1042
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,520
I have to re-clear everything.

1043
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,940
Okay, let's try off the ladybug.

1044
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:03,990
Ooh!

1045
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:05,270
Okay.

1046
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:07,850
Ladybug, come here.

1047
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:10,750
Ladybug, get closer to the edge.

1048
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:11,410
Ladybug?

1049
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:11,870
Oh!

1050
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:15,970
Okay, ladybug?

1051
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,790
I'm gonna push you, like, right there.

1052
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:19,210
Oh.

1053
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,350
Ladybug, don't leave me.

1054
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:23,350
Okay, ladybug?

1055
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:25,190
Ladybug?

1056
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:27,310
Ladybug?

1057
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:29,910
Ladybug?

1058
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:30,730
Oh.

1059
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:37,270
I think there's a wall!

1060
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:39,890
POV your cat noir.

1061
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:42,570
I'm a lady.

1062
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:49,690
Almost.

1063
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,590
I can't tell if there's a wall or if I'm just bad.

1064
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:54,350
Could be.

1065
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:55,330
Both?

1066
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,000
The first ladybug?

1067
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,500
Because he's trapped in that hole.

1068
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,640
Actually, can I get him out of that hole?

1069
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,160
I don't know.

1070
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,140
I don't think I can.

1071
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:06,740
Let's see.

1072
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,360
I thought he was trapped in there.

1073
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,420
What is this?

1074
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,600
They're in love with me!

1075
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,260
Oh my god, so cute!

1076
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,000
I just noticed we have, like, a little cave.

1077
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,480
So cute!

1078
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:41,620
Cute!

1079
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:43,680
Ah!

1080
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,700
Oh, I'm trapped?

1081
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,600
Okay, there we go.

1082
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:47,920
See ya!

1083
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,180
Oh, move, please.

1084
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,240
I'd say that was worth it.

1085
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:55,500
Ah!

1086
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,460
I think that was worth it.

1087
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,120
Okay, now we can continue on working.

1088
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:13,950
This song reminds me of, like, an idol song.

1089
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:17,130
Like, I could hear it being performed by an idol group.

1090
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:19,390
Oh,

1091
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:23,650
wait!

1092
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:25,030
They cleared this whole area!

1093
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:26,730
Aw, man.

1094
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,180
We're gonna use him to help us.

1095
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,580
You'll get up when I tell you to.

1096
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,680
Now be a good girl and sit there.

1097
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,260
Okay.

1098
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,500
Oh, Piggy!

1099
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,480
Woo!

1100
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:09,590
I think I have to destroy him a different way.

1101
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:11,710
Or I don't wake him up.

1102
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:15,430
I can't see him!

1103
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:17,470
I can't see him!

1104
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:18,990
A butt!

1105
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:21,690
Oh, maybe I need him to destroy this thing.

1106
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,010
Come here, come here!

1107
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:23,550
Wait!

1108
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:24,290
He's got a butt!

1109
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:41,870
He came back!

1110
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,190
And he spooked me!

1111
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,490
How do I...

1112
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,030
How do I take care of this part?

1113
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:54,450
Spin on the glowy spot?

1114
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:56,630
Oh,

1115
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:12,350
like this!

1116
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,110
Ah!

1117
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:30,380
One of these things is not like the other.

1118
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:33,200
One of these guys just doesn't belong!

1119
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,660
Oh, wait, I need you.

1120
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:38,640
Actually, come over here.

1121
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,140
I need you, I need you.

1122
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,760
I need you, I need you.

1123
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:42,720
Wake up.

1124
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:44,740
Come here, come here.

1125
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,140
Just a butt.

1126
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,520
Eva, I need you.

1127
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,340
Let him

1128
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:06,520
do his thing then.

1129
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:06,780
Forever.

1130
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,840
Why is there a ladybug here?

1131
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:12,860
Oh!

1132
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,100
Oh, cute!

1133
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,860
Oh my gosh!

1134
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:23,320
I can create such beautiful boobs.

1135
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:27,860
Figure eight.

1136
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,760
I was asked today if anything makes me happy.

1137
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,460
I answered thusly, Minto.

1138
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,340
What do you mean by that?

1139
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,160
What do you mean by that?

1140
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:40,760
What do you mean by that?

1141
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,380
Oh, I'm stuck.

1142
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:57,900
Wait.

1143
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:58,560
Oh, that...

1144
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:00,400
Oh

1145
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:10,410
my gosh, that was so close.

1146
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:11,210
I almost didn't get it.

1147
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,350
I almost didn't get it.

1148
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,790
Oh, he got him to break it!

1149
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:17,970
Wait!

1150
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:20,190
No!

1151
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:20,550
Wow!

1152
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:24,550
I think there was one...

1153
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:25,710
I think there was one...

1154
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:26,470
I think there was also a gray fox.

1155
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:28,650
I think.

1156
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:30,510
I wonder if he's in this level two then.

1157
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:34,470
I wonder if gray fox is here.

1158
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:40,950
I think those are the three metal gears in this...

1159
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:41,910
in this game.

1160
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:45,450
I don't remember if there's any more, to be honest.

1161
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:54,310
Actually, if I go down here...

1162
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:55,470
Oh, there's a ladder.

1163
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:57,390
I was like, how do I get back up?

1164
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:00,650
There are more?

1165
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:02,390
There are more?

1166
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:02,970
For real?

1167
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,580
Speak of the devil.

1168
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,320
Yeah, more than three?

1169
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:17,960
No way.

1170
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,180
Oh my gosh.

1171
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,160
I'm so excited then.

1172
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,440
I only know of the three of them.

1173
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:23,500
So...

1174
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:24,700
Whoa!

1175
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:28,220
Oh

1176
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:33,580
my gosh, it's...

1177
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,040
It's just havoc.

1178
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,020
It's chaos.

1179
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,840
It's... Oh my god.

1180
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,120
We're destroying everything.

1181
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,120
I'll get you, gray fox!

1182
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,200
After Zanzibar!

1183
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,720
I was taken from the battlefield!

1184
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,080
Neither truly alive.

1185
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,980
Nor truly dead.

1186
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,740
Oh my god.

1187
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,500
He's wiggling his butt in front of me.

1188
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:02,320
Oh my god.

1189
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,120
What are you...

1190
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,680
Are you asking me to smack your butt?

1191
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:06,300
Gray fox?

1192
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,580
Oh my god.

1193
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,640
He wants me to tap that ass.

1194
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,960
Oh my god.

1195
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,280
I mean, if you insist.

1196
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:21,880
I mean, Astro Bot looks really excited to do so also.

1197
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,520
Do you notice he's like...

1198
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,080
He's like ready to...

1199
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,920
He's ready to do it.

1200
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:28,980
Alright, here we go.

1201
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:32,480
We're in prime ass punching position.

1202
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,860
Here we go.

1203
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,420
Hurt him more.

1204
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,920
Hurt me more, snake!

1205
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:43,760
Look at them!

1206
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:45,620
Neither enemy nor friend!

1207
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,780
Mystery ninja!

1208
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,980
Look, they're all so happy.

1209
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,200
He's just sitting there.

1210
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,300
Everybody else is like...

1211
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:58,640
He's just...

1212
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,940
He's just staring at the camera.

1213
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,500
Gray fox, are you okay?

1214
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,480
He's so traumatized.

1215
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,740
Do something!

1216
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,040
Do something!

1217
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,260
Do something!

1218
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,520
Are you alive?

1219
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,540
Do something!

1220
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,200
Do something!

1221
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,320
Hello!

1222
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,480
I think you broke him.

1223
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,080
I think so too.

1224
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,140
These guys are camping me.

1225
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,100
Let's get out of here.

1226
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,540
Let's get out of here.

1227
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,040
Let's get out of here.

1228
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,600
Hurt me more, snake.

1229
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,320
Wait, I didn't notice.

1230
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,220
Have we gotten all the...

1231
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,000
All the guys so far?

1232
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:02,490
We haven't missed one, right?

1233
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:03,930
Good.

1234
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:05,710
That's where I need you.

1235
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,530
We're missing one, but...

1236
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:10,590
But...

1237
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:11,510
No, I missed one!

1238
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:13,410
Oh, check with the button.

1239
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:15,330
Oh!

1240
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,430
Oh my gosh, towards the beginning!

1241
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:19,670
Look at Snake.

1242
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:21,570
He looks so happy there.

1243
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:26,850
Wait, I missed a guy.

1244
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:29,070
Okay, well, the second one...

1245
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:31,910
The last one is probably up there, right?

1246
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:33,230
Oh my gosh, that's a big guy.

1247
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:35,370
Okay, hold on.

1248
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:40,070
We missed some.

1249
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:44,090
Hmm...

1250
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:51,920
What are those guys doing on the ice right there?

1251
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:52,180
What are those guys doing on the ice right there?

1252
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:52,860
Do you see them?

1253
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:56,240
Are they supposed to be there?

1254
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:56,560
Are they supposed to be there?

1255
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:01,140
Okay, so it's in between Snake and Psycho Mantis.

1256
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:01,220
Okay, so it's in between Snake and Psycho Mantis.

1257
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:01,920
So...

1258
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,760
He's gotta be around that way.

1259
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,560
Check the second floor basement.

1260
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,440
Second floor basement?

1261
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:10,700
Oh!

1262
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,420
So cute.

1263
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:16,620
Hmm...

1264
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:17,960
Oh, maybe like a...

1265
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,480
There's some stuff up here though that we...

1266
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:25,620
Oh!

1267
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:28,900
Ah!

1268
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,880
Oh man!

1269
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:31,480
Wait!

1270
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,320
Was it a...

1271
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,160
Oh, I think I had to like wait.

1272
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:36,580
Okay.

1273
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,140
Until it turned gold.

1274
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,680
I didn't realize it was like...

1275
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,460
Spinning around.

1276
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,760
I wanna get up there, but...

1277
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:46,720
Do you think if I go through here...

1278
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:47,800
Oh!

1279
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,020
Is this my second shot?

1280
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,460
Is this my second shot?

1281
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:16,380
There we go.

1282
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:20,890
Okay, let's try this again.

1283
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:23,470
Okay, let's try this again.

1284
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:23,470
Hey!

1285
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:23,990
Oh!

1286
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:24,890
Hey!

1287
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:27,490
Ah!

1288
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:27,990
Okay.

1289
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:28,390
Whoa!

1290
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:30,350
Wow, we get a lot.

1291
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:30,770
Okay.

1292
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:35,450
The ice seal?

1293
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:37,670
Yeah, I think he's probably in there, right?

1294
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:41,410
That would make the most sense, but I tried beating it up.

1295
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:44,490
Hmm...

1296
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:44,590
Hmm...

1297
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:48,750
This pig's gonna show back up again.

1298
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:49,970
Ow!

1299
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:53,250
What did I...

1300
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:55,210
I thought I saw something jump out of here.

1301
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:57,170
I think that's just the checkpoint guy.

1302
01:02:58,110 --> 01:02:59,050
Try the pig?

1303
01:02:59,350 --> 01:02:59,610
Oh!

1304
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:06,030
Gui!

1305
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:09,170
Buhi!

1306
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:09,650
Buhi!

1307
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:10,770
Buhi!

1308
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:11,150
Buhi!

1309
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:11,530
Buhi!

1310
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:11,870
Buhi!

1311
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:12,210
Buhi!

1312
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:12,590
Buhi!

1313
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:12,990
Buhi!

1314
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:13,310
Buhi!

1315
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:13,610
Buhi!

1316
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:13,690
Buhi!

1317
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:13,770
Buhi!

1318
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:13,950
Buhi!

1319
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:13,950
Buhi!

1320
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:13,950
Buhi!

1321
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:14,190
Buhi!

1322
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:14,190
Buhi!

1323
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:14,350
Buhi!

1324
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:15,910
Buhi!

1325
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:18,290
Boop boop boop boop boop boop!

1326
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,040
You guys are kinda geniuses, I think.

1327
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:33,190
Oh, disco party!

1328
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:35,270
Wow, there's actual ice cream in here!

1329
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:37,250
Oh!

1330
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:42,170
Apples?

1331
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:43,910
On my ice cream?

1332
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:45,270
That's me!

1333
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:49,570
Oh!

1334
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:51,930
Oh.

1335
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,680
This one looks like takoyaki.

1336
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:04,220
Yummy.

1337
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,000
Takoyaki.

1338
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,040
Anything else I can see?

1339
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:17,760
We're partying on the disco ball.

1340
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:20,660
Takoyaki.

1341
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,360
Wait, what is this?

1342
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,140
This seems like a conclusion.

1343
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:46,230
What's going on?

1344
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:53,290
Huh?

1345
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:57,530
Lost galaxy?

1346
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:01,710
Washroom.

1347
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:05,670
Funky fungi!

1348
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:08,870
I guess we gotta go.

1349
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:11,890
I wasn't done with that world though.

1350
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:15,250
I swear it's the other guy!

1351
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:18,330
Everybody watch out!

1352
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:19,710
Watch out!

1353
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:20,150
Watch out!

1354
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:22,910
Thank

1355
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:27,060
you!

1356
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:32,900
Are you a fungi, Mint?

1357
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:34,880
Yeah?

1358
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:35,900
I'm a mushroom.

1359
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:40,480
The dolphins.

1360
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:44,200
I just wanna be part of your symphony!

1361
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:49,580
Oh!

1362
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:52,780
Hmm...

1363
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:58,510
Yeah, you think you're so tough.

1364
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:00,070
You think.

1365
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:00,690
You thought.

1366
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:04,830
Oh, I have to...

1367
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:05,210
Oh, that's right.

1368
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:05,650
I do.

1369
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:06,230
Oh, wait.

1370
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:10,410
I think I do it on here.

1371
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:11,550
Okay, yeah.

1372
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,140
I saw that.

1373
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,160
Not a very good disguise, if you tell me.

1374
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:22,400
Yikes!

1375
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,020
Thanks for the tag, Giften!

1376
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:26,740
Whoa!

1377
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:27,860
Wow!

1378
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:28,800
Wow!

1379
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:31,980
Who is that?

1380
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:32,660
Oh my gosh.

1381
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:37,730
Astro, what?

1382
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:38,470
Who is this?

1383
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:43,920
I guess we gotta punch him to find out.

1384
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:48,340
Bot rescued!

1385
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,260
Vampire killer?

1386
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:51,260
Castlevania?

1387
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,880
John Castlevania?

1388
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:54,600
It's...

1389
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:54,860
Wait!

1390
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:55,860
It's Richter Belmont!

1391
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:56,820
Ha ha ha ha!

1392
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:07,640
Comes from a long line of Candle Smashers.

1393
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:11,440
Whoa!

1394
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,760
We're gonna get Castlevania guys here!

1395
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:16,020
There's so many fun...

1396
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:16,720
Oh, sorry.

1397
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,240
What is this thing supposed to be?

1398
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:19,120
Hey.

1399
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,360
Explain yourself.

1400
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,520
What is your existence?

1401
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,460
Are you a cricket?

1402
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:28,350
Oh, it's a cricket.

1403
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:28,630
Yeah.

1404
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:31,990
There's a snake.

1405
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:33,330
It's a little slithery snake.

1406
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:44,770
Oh, hold on.

1407
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:46,910
I don't know how to swing.

1408
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:49,070
And jump!

1409
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:52,890
This looks mysterious.

1410
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:58,300
Guess it's nothing.

1411
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,560
It's kind of swirly, right?

1412
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,680
Like it should be something there.

1413
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:09,180
Not so solid snake.

1414
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,280
Goodness.

1415
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:20,920
Nasty.

1416
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:29,100
Before we continue onwards, I'm going to keep checking this to make sure we don't miss any people.

1417
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,880
First time watching you, you didn't disappoint.

1418
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:40,100
Thanks for the third Super Chat with your first time watching!

1419
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:45,530
Thank you!

1420
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:05,390
Oh, what is...

1421
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:06,550
Oh, okay.

1422
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:09,770
So there's going to be a spiky guy and also...

1423
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:12,130
Wait!

1424
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:16,170
No!

1425
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:17,750
No!

1426
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,160
I gotta get this guy.

1427
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:33,540
Ow!

1428
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,360
I blew myself up.

1429
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:41,860
I blew myself up.

1430
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:55,750
I missed my...

1431
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:57,430
There we go.

1432
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:00,530
Ah, come on!

1433
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:02,230
Nasty!

1434
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:03,790
There we go.

1435
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:09,030
Now how do I throw?

1436
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:10,410
Square!

1437
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:14,920
Did I throw it?

1438
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:15,780
Oh, no.

1439
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:22,230
And... square!

1440
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,060
That's why the...

1441
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:50,080
That's why the mushrooms were glowy!

1442
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,260
In the ice cream world!

1443
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,200
It was a sign!

1444
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,100
It was a sign!

1445
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:01,700
It's the fun guys.

1446
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,760
Are we so sure about that?

1447
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:04,780
Hahaha.

1448
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,240
I see this.

1449
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:10,700
Don't worry.

1450
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:11,520
I'm not that blind.

1451
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,300
Okay.

1452
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,540
That's what that does.

1453
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:19,520
Understood.

1454
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:40,560
Yesha!

1455
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,040
Oh, wait.

1456
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:43,500
Uh...

1457
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:44,920
This...

1458
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:45,160
Yeah.

1459
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:47,660
No!

1460
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:48,680
No!

1461
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:49,520
No!

1462
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:50,540
No!

1463
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,140
Ta-da!

1464
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:53,600
Little...

1465
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,540
Oh, it's these guys!

1466
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:54,680
Yeah!

1467
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:00,890
You thought.

1468
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:06,870
Yeah,

1469
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:19,720
get his butt.

1470
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:22,440
Yesha!

1471
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:24,560
Yesha!

1472
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:27,360
There's so many places we can go.

1473
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:27,960
I'm like...

1474
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:28,300
Oh, my gosh.

1475
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:28,560
Okay.

1476
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:32,560
There's so many places we can go to.

1477
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:34,100
Wait!

1478
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:43,250
Song is nice.

1479
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:43,750
I know, right?

1480
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:43,910
Alright.

1481
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:46,410
Yarnim Tourist.

1482
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:48,330
Destined for greatness.

1483
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:52,950
Who term is Bloodborne?

1484
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:53,210
Ah!

1485
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:58,290
John Bloodborne.

1486
01:12:58,590 --> 01:12:59,170
I gotta...

1487
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:00,550
I'm gonna play that soon, you guys.

1488
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:03,630
Gonna be playing that soon.

1489
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:05,750
I think we got everything up here then.

1490
01:13:07,010 --> 01:13:07,510
Hahaha.

1491
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:09,750
I...

1492
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:10,550
Oh.

1493
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:12,450
Do-do-do-do-do-do.

1494
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:12,830
Darn.

1495
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:13,290
Okay.

1496
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:13,710
Okay.

1497
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:21,510
I think we got everything up here.

1498
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:21,530
Okay.

1499
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:22,830
Oh, gosh!

1500
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:25,870
Wow!

1501
01:13:28,490 --> 01:13:29,490
Get away from me!

1502
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:36,790
Sometimes it sounds like he's going, shoobah-shoobah-shoobah-shoobah!

1503
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:39,910
Oh, I missed every...

1504
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:42,070
You missed every shot you take, you guys.

1505
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:44,770
Those words to live by.

1506
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:45,090
Okay?

1507
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,120
A fungobot!

1508
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:56,500
Get it?

1509
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,460
Because he's got fungus on him.

1510
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,820
But he's a bot.

1511
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:06,180
Get it?

1512
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:10,480
Like a funcopop, but he's a fungobot.

1513
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,700
You get it?

1514
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:16,300
It's a good joke.

1515
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:27,300
But that was negative to me!

1516
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:34,150
I'm gonna go the other way.

1517
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:38,890
I don't know if it's any different or not, but I feel like it could be.

1518
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:48,740
Maybe it wasn't different at all.

1519
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:49,980
Oh my gosh!

1520
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:50,260
Ow!

1521
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,400
Wait, how far behind are we?

1522
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:55,820
Oh, okay.

1523
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:56,400
Not that far.

1524
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:57,820
Right?

1525
01:14:58,960 --> 01:14:59,480
Yeah.

1526
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:04,500
Okay, I'm glad that even though there's like checkpoints, the checkpoints are only for...

1527
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:08,160
Wait, what's this?

1528
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,520
Did I go down here?

1529
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,100
I did not go down here.

1530
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,520
They're only for like where you respawn.

1531
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:39,030
This one.

1532
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:42,150
How's it go?

1533
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:46,800
Oh!

1534
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:49,200
There we go!

1535
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,840
I was gonna say that one felt weird.

1536
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,700
The vibration.

1537
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:55,600
Yeah!

1538
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,340
They're clapping at me!

1539
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:00,200
They were like, wow!

1540
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:02,980
I think Minto is a genius for real.

1541
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:13,730
Oh my gosh, wait.

1542
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:15,190
Yeah.

1543
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:21,880
Get it.

1544
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:22,820
Get it.

1545
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,440
Wait, these are actual...

1546
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:28,890
Wait!

1547
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:29,150
Wait!

1548
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:29,390
Wait!

1549
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:29,790
Wait!

1550
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:30,350
Wait!

1551
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:31,130
Wait!

1552
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:31,710
Wait!

1553
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:32,170
Wait!

1554
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:32,490
Wait!

1555
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:32,590
Wait!

1556
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:32,790
Wait!

1557
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:32,890
Wait!

1558
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:33,090
Wait!

1559
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:33,110
Wait!

1560
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:48,840
Yippee!

1561
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:49,080
Yippee!

1562
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:49,440
Yippee!

1563
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:49,580
Yippee!

1564
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:49,720
Yippee!

1565
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:49,780
Yippee!

1566
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:53,240
Easy.

1567
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:53,660
Easy.

1568
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:54,220
Easy.

1569
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:56,140
I'm high-fiving the crowd right now.

1570
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:58,920
I'm high-fiving the crowd.

1571
01:16:58,920 --> 01:16:59,740
High-five!

1572
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:00,180
Hi-five!

1573
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:00,840
Hi-five!

1574
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:02,140
Hai-five!

1575
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,100
Hai-five!

1576
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:03,960
Hai-five!

1577
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:05,080
High-five!

1578
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:05,660
Hi-five!

1579
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:06,000
Hi-five!

1580
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:06,340
Hi-five!

1581
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:06,580
High-five!

1582
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:06,600
Hi-five!

1583
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:06,720
Hi-five!

1584
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:07,000
Hi-five!

1585
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:07,100
Hi-five!

1586
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:09,340
That's our victory lap.

1587
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,940
When he spins, it says gururukuru.

1588
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:13,860
It means he spins.

1589
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:15,640
Wait, he does?

1590
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:16,580
I didn't hear him say that.

1591
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,960
I know gururukuru means spin.

1592
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:21,920
Couldn't hear him say it, though.

1593
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:24,500
Oh that!

1594
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:25,360
Gururukuru!

1595
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:29,170
Oh wait, it's not over yet...

1596
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:36,540
Come on!

1597
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:36,740
Come on!

1598
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:37,100
Come on!

1599
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:37,400
Come on!

1600
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:39,800
Secret!

1601
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:46,940
Is that it?

1602
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,040
Do I go down?

1603
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:53,560
Oh!

1604
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:53,940
Oh!

1605
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:54,440
Gross!

1606
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:54,820
Gross!

1607
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:55,120
Gross!

1608
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,200
Let me wash myself.

1609
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:01,100
Oh!

1610
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:02,040
Look how cute he is!

1611
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:04,080
He's so cute.

1612
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:04,380
Oh!

1613
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:04,880
Gross!

1614
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:05,140
Gross!

1615
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:05,480
Gross!

1616
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:06,680
Gross!

1617
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:07,060
Gross!

1618
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:07,600
Gross!

1619
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:07,880
Gross!

1620
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:08,120
Gross!

1621
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:08,240
Gross!

1622
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:09,300
Gross!

1623
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:09,600
Nasty!

1624
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:10,620
Nasty!

1625
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:11,040
Nasty!

1626
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:24,490
Alucard!

1627
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:25,030
Thank you!

1628
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:29,930
The name backwards!

1629
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:36,900
No, it's Dracula backwards.

1630
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:39,160
Dandidampire!

1631
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:40,280
Dampire.

1632
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,800
The total opposite of his father.

1633
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:43,960
Literally!

1634
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,640
Look at them.

1635
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:47,740
They're partying.

1636
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:48,520
So crazy.

1637
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,880
Wait, I forgot to check.

1638
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,380
Okay, we have just one guy left.

1639
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:54,080
And then we're good.

1640
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:56,280
Do we go down here?

1641
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,160
Did you know Alucard is backwards as Hunter?

1642
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,700
Okay, we can't go down there.

1643
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,320
Good to know.

1644
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:11,880
Okay,

1645
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:15,540
we're back here.

1646
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:17,100
Very good.

1647
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:19,200
Bye!

1648
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:28,200
Bye!

1649
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:28,300
Bye!

1650
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:28,680
Bye!

1651
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:29,020
Bye!

1652
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,400
Okay.

1653
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:34,220
This rock looks suspicious.

1654
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,880
I think.

1655
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:41,020
Oh my god.

1656
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:42,420
Oh no, not this.

1657
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:48,360
Oh my god.

1658
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:51,080
Pull his ass!

1659
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:54,360
David, thanks for the time gifted!

1660
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:55,180
Raid?

1661
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:57,580
I don't ever see the raid messages.

1662
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,460
Thank you for the raid!

1663
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:00,880
Yay!

1664
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:05,260
YouTube is so broken.

1665
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:10,160
Hello, hello, hello!

1666
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:12,180
I'm playing Astro Bot.

1667
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,220
And it's really cute.

1668
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,300
I'm totally normal.

1669
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:18,420
How cute this game is.

1670
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:20,960
It's actually so cute.

1671
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,820
Wait, can I go around here?

1672
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:25,700
Oh, no.

1673
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:26,760
I could...

1674
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,120
I hear someone crying.

1675
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:31,520
I hear someone...

1676
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,540
begging for their life.

1677
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:36,600
Where are they?

1678
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,400
I hear them begging for their life!

1679
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:41,940
Where are they?

1680
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,300
Ducky, thanks for the gift!

1681
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:50,940
Oh my god, there's so much more up there even.

1682
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:52,440
Okay, maybe he's up top.

1683
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,680
I thought this was like the end of the road.

1684
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:58,300
I think we have to defeat this guy.

1685
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,020
Oh my gosh.

1686
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:03,160
That was easy.

1687
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:06,840
Yeah, there he is, there he is, there he is!

1688
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:07,200
Okay.

1689
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,120
We got him, we got him, we got him.

1690
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:19,770
Oh, Jack, thank you for the 20 gift!

1691
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:21,810
AX, thanks for the 5 gift!

1692
01:21:25,030 --> 01:21:25,870
Oh, hold on.

1693
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:27,170
How do I...

1694
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:29,290
How do I do this?

1695
01:21:29,290 --> 01:21:30,990
Wait, can I use the...

1696
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:32,170
this to go up here?

1697
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:35,390
No, it doesn't go up high enough.

1698
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:38,210
This is my 25th birthday this weekend!

1699
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:39,070
Happy birthday!

1700
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:42,030
I already had a quarter life crisis.

1701
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:45,690
But can my fave Stinky Mates see me?

1702
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:47,310
Happy birthday.

1703
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:49,450
Yes!

1704
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:53,130
Don't have a quarter life crisis.

1705
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:59,470
Instead, have a half life crisis.

1706
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:01,410
Full life consequences.

1707
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:05,670
Happy birthday to you!

1708
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:09,030
Happy birthday to you!

1709
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:12,510
Happy birthday dear Adobo!

1710
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:16,310
I'm not Stinky Mate!

1711
01:22:17,450 --> 01:22:18,790
Happy birthday!

1712
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:21,850
C2!

1713
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:24,010
Thanks for the 5 gift!

1714
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:24,950
Jack is out!

1715
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:26,330
Thanks for the 20 gift!

1716
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:29,110
Thank you guys!

1717
01:22:29,290 --> 01:22:30,250
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1718
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:33,790
Ay-yasha!

1719
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:34,990
Ay-yasha!

1720
01:22:37,570 --> 01:22:37,970
Hmm...

1721
01:22:37,970 --> 01:22:40,950
I feel like I have to use this to get up here, but...

1722
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:43,090
Maybe I just have to time it better.

1723
01:22:47,150 --> 01:22:47,550
Whaaaaat?

1724
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:50,900
How do I get up there?

1725
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,140
There must be another way.

1726
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:58,860
Maybe I jump up on the top of here.

1727
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,440
It is a little bit angled.

1728
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:03,140
Alright...

1729
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:06,340
Oh!

1730
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:06,740
Ah!

1731
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:07,580
Maybe, maybe...

1732
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:08,300
Okay, hold on, hold on.

1733
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,080
The second one...

1734
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:19,180
Let me try this one more time.

1735
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,220
Try princess!

1736
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:23,900
Thanks for the 5...

1737
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:25,720
gift!

1738
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,660
Okay, I'll go to this then.

1739
01:23:38,910 --> 01:23:41,090
But it just puts me further away.

1740
01:23:41,370 --> 01:23:43,550
That's why I was like, I don't know if it's this one.

1741
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:49,140
I just go really far away.

1742
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:52,180
Sment.

1743
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:53,540
Flamo.

1744
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:55,560
Sment.

1745
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,060
Oh, maybe that stone right there.

1746
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:02,900
I do see it.

1747
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:07,040
Sment.

1748
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:08,460
Weee!

1749
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:13,600
Hold on.

1750
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,240
This one right here, right?

1751
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,440
Yeah, yeah.

1752
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:18,800
This seems to be the one.

1753
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:22,600
This seems to be the one.

1754
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:28,980
How dare!

1755
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:31,340
You want me to slap your butt?

1756
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:33,200
Family.

1757
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,200
A little family.

1758
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:42,380
A little family.

1759
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:44,600
Kiss himself!

1760
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,240
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

1761
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:47,560
Thank you!

1762
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:49,440
Okay.

1763
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,280
Now that we did that, we can continue onward.

1764
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:55,260
Oh, just kidding.

1765
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:59,520
I have to make the platform before we do that.

1766
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,800
Oh gosh, oh gosh.

1767
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,440
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

1768
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,780
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

1769
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:10,420
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

1770
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:16,040
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

1771
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:26,340
I did not think he was going to be able to reach that far.

1772
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:27,920
Okay.

1773
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,180
Oh my god!

1774
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:31,840
Oh my god!

1775
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:47,830
I don't think he can destroy this one!

1776
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:50,550
But I can get flattened.

1777
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:52,450
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

1778
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:54,990
I can get flattened though.

1779
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:56,270
Oh my gosh.

1780
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:03,920
Okay.

1781
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:06,700
Oh my gosh, that was so close.

1782
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:09,360
We

1783
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:13,910
had him!

1784
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:15,830
So...

1785
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:18,870
I nearly had him.

1786
01:26:36,570 --> 01:26:38,030
I'm going to go back and get it.

1787
01:26:41,770 --> 01:26:42,650
My coin!

1788
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:45,210
I really want to play this game.

1789
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:48,550
Just to see my Oshii John Ace Combat.

1790
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:51,370
Wait!

1791
01:26:51,450 --> 01:26:52,870
Ace Combat is in this too!

1792
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,210
Oh my god.

1793
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:13,640
Oh my god.

1794
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:14,100
Wow, it's beautiful.

1795
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,000
Oh, they're so cute!

1796
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:18,740
The soundtrack in this game is so good.

1797
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:21,500
This game is so cute!

1798
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:28,820
This guy...

1799
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:33,740
He's like, What are you waiting for?

1800
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,400
Get out of my home!

1801
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,660
You've caused enough havoc!

1802
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:39,800
You've destroyed everything!

1803
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:42,380
All of my lifelong work!

1804
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:44,100
Please leave!

1805
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:47,060
Yeah!

1806
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:47,860
Yeah!

1807
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:51,200
Why is he British?

1808
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:51,720
I don't know.

1809
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:54,620
Gets British energy.

1810
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:55,880
Here we go!

1811
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:56,420
Oh!

1812
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:57,620
Okay, hold on.

1813
01:27:58,620 --> 01:27:59,220
Wow!

1814
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:04,160
I did it this time.

1815
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:10,240
Woo!

1816
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:10,660
Woo!

1817
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:12,640
Our home planet.

1818
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:14,300
Yay!

1819
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:15,960
World Conq.

1820
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:16,220
Wait.

1821
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:17,160
Oh!

1822
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,640
I missed a puzzle piece!

1823
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,020
I love the silly ghost of me.

1824
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,200
Thanks for the super turret!

1825
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:28,140
Can you change your astrobot to snake?

1826
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:29,220
Can I?

1827
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:30,580
Can I?

1828
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:32,680
Go back.

1829
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:35,600
Secrets.

1830
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:36,760
Secrets.

1831
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:41,300
Here?

1832
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:42,600
Crash sound.

1833
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:48,350
Wheeew!

1834
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:48,950
Wheeew!

1835
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:49,290
Wheeew!

1836
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:56,070
Good morning!

1837
01:28:57,650 --> 01:28:58,030
Oh!

1838
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:01,070
Whoa!

1839
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:04,800
Oh!

1840
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:05,700
Our civilization!

1841
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:07,180
Oh my gosh!

1842
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:08,780
We're taking over this planet too!

1843
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:09,520
Hahaha!

1844
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:14,920
Wait.

1845
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:15,760
No!

1846
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:16,640
Why is Graybot...

1847
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:17,720
Why are they all flossing!

1848
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:35,050
You rescued your first bot!

1849
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:37,750
Many more scattered across the universe.

1850
01:29:37,970 --> 01:29:40,170
So search every planet and try to rescue them all!

1851
01:29:45,190 --> 01:29:45,630
Oh!

1852
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:46,110
Oh!

1853
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:48,150
This is what we're collecting the pieces for!

1854
01:29:48,790 --> 01:29:49,530
Oh my god.

1855
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:50,450
They just saluted me.

1856
01:29:50,690 --> 01:29:51,070
Wait.

1857
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:51,730
Snake, come back.

1858
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:52,330
Snake!

1859
01:29:52,510 --> 01:29:52,890
Snake!

1860
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:53,950
Snake!

1861
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:54,790
Snake, come here.

1862
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:55,410
Snake!

1863
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:56,270
Snake!

1864
01:29:56,710 --> 01:29:57,710
Snake, come here.

1865
01:29:57,790 --> 01:29:58,030
Snake.

1866
01:29:58,370 --> 01:30:00,330
Why are you guys running the furthest away?

1867
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:03,490
Oh my god.

1868
01:30:03,610 --> 01:30:04,190
Oh my god.

1869
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:06,430
Snake.

1870
01:30:06,430 --> 01:30:06,870
Hahaha!

1871
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:07,790
Hahaha!

1872
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:15,190
Oh my god.

1873
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:15,950
Look at him like...

1874
01:30:15,950 --> 01:30:17,090
Do you see him sitting there?

1875
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:18,990
Look at him like bouncing up and down like that.

1876
01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:20,490
Hahaha!

1877
01:30:22,570 --> 01:30:24,190
He hurt me more!

1878
01:30:24,430 --> 01:30:24,690
Snake!

1879
01:30:25,370 --> 01:30:25,850
Hahaha!

1880
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:27,710
Hahaha!

1881
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:30,690
What's the little symbol by them?

1882
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:31,190
What is this?

1883
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:36,680
Hahaha!

1884
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:36,880
Hahaha!

1885
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:42,950
It's gotcha!

1886
01:30:44,510 --> 01:30:47,330
You can get special animations for them later?

1887
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:54,700
You can get special animations for them later?

1888
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:55,820
What is this pee-pee music?

1889
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:57,140
Oh!

1890
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:58,160
A puzzle piece.

1891
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,740
I need to sacrifice 10.

1892
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:07,380
Snake!

1893
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:14,020
Wait, where are they going?

1894
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:16,920
What the?

1895
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:17,620
Go!

1896
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,460
Oh, here I go!

1897
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:22,460
I'm going too!

1898
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:34,210
You can...

1899
01:31:35,430 --> 01:31:37,090
You can let go.

1900
01:31:37,850 --> 01:31:39,450
Maybe if I run away.

1901
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:41,370
Maybe if I run away they...

1902
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:42,130
Okay.

1903
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:43,750
Return to your position!

1904
01:31:44,210 --> 01:31:44,450
Hahaha!

1905
01:31:46,590 --> 01:31:47,870
You stupid...

1906
01:31:47,870 --> 01:31:48,250
Hahaha!

1907
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:49,510
Hahaha!

1908
01:31:52,970 --> 01:31:54,770
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

1909
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:56,210
I didn't mean to...

1910
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:56,950
punch you.

1911
01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:03,370
It hurts me more...

1912
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:03,870
mental.

1913
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:07,470
Oh, we need stuff for that.

1914
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:09,610
Oh my gosh.

1915
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:11,490
This game is giving me so much energy.

1916
01:32:11,790 --> 01:32:11,930
Oh!

1917
01:32:12,590 --> 01:32:13,210
Oh!

1918
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:14,250
Yippee!

1919
01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:18,730
Changing room?

1920
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:20,470
It's under construction.

1921
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:27,500
I need to sacrifice 10 bots.

1922
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:32,020
Nine bots.

1923
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,380
Here we go!

1924
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:41,180
Here we go!

1925
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:42,600
Heave ho, everybody!

1926
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,120
Heave ho!

1927
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:49,020
Heave ho!

1928
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,160
Heave ho!

1929
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:51,680
Heave ho!

1930
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,020
Oh, me too.

1931
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:54,520
I guess I should put in the work.

1932
01:33:01,650 --> 01:33:03,410
You need to help.

1933
01:33:04,590 --> 01:33:05,650
You need to help.

1934
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:05,990
Capable!

1935
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:07,370
What are you talking about?

1936
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:10,530
Hahaha!

1937
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:13,430
Hey, everybody!

1938
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:15,830
Hey, all you people.

1939
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:17,590
Hey, all you people.

1940
01:33:18,170 --> 01:33:19,370
Hey, all you people.

1941
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:20,690
Won't you listen to me?

1942
01:33:23,790 --> 01:33:24,270
Okay,

1943
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:29,940
I got it.

1944
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:30,880
We're done.

1945
01:33:33,210 --> 01:33:34,790
See, look how capable they are.

1946
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:39,730
The changing room is where you can dress...

1947
01:33:39,730 --> 01:33:40,470
a snake?

1948
01:33:42,770 --> 01:33:43,970
Wait, I already did this one.

1949
01:33:44,030 --> 01:33:45,250
Why is it telling me to do it again?

1950
01:33:47,370 --> 01:33:47,770
Interesting.

1951
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:54,390
I feel like you'd be a terrible boss.

1952
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:55,370
What are you talking about?

1953
01:33:58,090 --> 01:33:58,890
You guys...

1954
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:00,270
I'm a great boss.

1955
01:34:00,790 --> 01:34:01,890
I run a maid cafe.

1956
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:06,470
That's why you guys call me boss.

1957
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:06,790
Right?

1958
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:22,420
Oh my gosh.

1959
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:23,260
We must free them.

1960
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:24,000
Hurry!

1961
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:25,100
Snake!

1962
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:27,060
They're dead!

1963
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:27,740
They're dead!

1964
01:34:30,570 --> 01:34:31,420
Bot rescue.

1965
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,220
Oh, we actually got some more.

1966
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:33,900
That's crazy.

1967
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,320
Okay, I'm jumping on.

1968
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:42,600
I'm climbing you.

1969
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:45,240
Oh, snake.

1970
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:46,620
Oh, snake.

1971
01:34:48,530 --> 01:34:48,900
Snake.

1972
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:50,860
Snake.

1973
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:51,340
Snake.

1974
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:52,820
Snake.

1975
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:53,840
He's shaking his head.

1976
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:55,340
He's like, don't do it.

1977
01:34:56,660 --> 01:34:57,060
Snake.

1978
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:03,020
Sorry, I don't mean to harass you.

1979
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:04,520
Oh, hold on.

1980
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:05,240
I gotta do it again.

1981
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:06,780
Sorry, my bad.

1982
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:09,200
I'm not just doing this on purpose or anything.

1983
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:11,520
Snake.

1984
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:13,420
Yay!

1985
01:35:18,490 --> 01:35:19,270
Are you okay?

1986
01:35:21,790 --> 01:35:23,070
What's getting you so excited?

1987
01:35:41,650 --> 01:35:42,870
He'll come back.

1988
01:35:44,050 --> 01:35:45,450
He'll come back, right?

1989
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:53,740
Do not punch the guys.

1990
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:01,040
What are they doing?

1991
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:01,560
They're fighting.

1992
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:03,440
The girls are fighting.

1993
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,280
Are you guys okay?

1994
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:06,740
What's going on?

1995
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:10,680
What's happening?

1996
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,460
Go home.

1997
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:12,620
Go home.

1998
01:36:24,330 --> 01:36:26,090
They're terrified of what?

1999
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:29,870
Miss the war crime.

2000
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:31,190
No, no, no, no, no.

2001
01:36:31,970 --> 01:36:32,850
He'll come back.

2002
01:36:33,670 --> 01:36:34,770
I rescued him.

2003
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:36,630
I rescued him.

2004
01:36:38,230 --> 01:36:39,230
What is this thing?

2005
01:36:39,850 --> 01:36:40,270
Oh.

2006
01:36:54,910 --> 01:36:57,030
Why isn't it now letting me go to the next page?

2007
01:36:57,910 --> 01:36:58,690
Oh, R1.

2008
01:36:58,750 --> 01:36:59,070
My bad.

2009
01:36:59,150 --> 01:36:59,850
I was pressing R2.

2010
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:00,970
Oh, there they are.

2011
01:37:04,230 --> 01:37:04,650
Hehe.

2012
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:09,370
Look at him.

2013
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:10,750
He stands so proud.

2014
01:37:15,570 --> 01:37:18,810
Oh my gosh.

2015
01:37:20,230 --> 01:37:22,830
He got his little hair thing.

2016
01:37:22,890 --> 01:37:23,990
His little hair blips.

2017
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:25,650
Wait, they gave him side...

2018
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:27,350
Like, wicked sideburns.

2019
01:37:27,430 --> 01:37:28,410
Look at that.

2020
01:37:31,570 --> 01:37:34,670
Does MGS1 Snake have sideburns?

2021
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:35,490
Rookus!

2022
01:37:35,490 --> 01:37:37,390
Thanks for the time gifter.

2023
01:37:37,830 --> 01:37:38,810
Thank you.

2024
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:39,710
Woohoo.

2025
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:46,150
Oh my gosh.

2026
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:47,470
Wow!

2027
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:50,010
Oh my god.

2028
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:51,270
It looks so good.

2029
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:54,270
Looks so good.

2030
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:55,150
Don't be doco.

2031
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:56,010
What are you talking about?

2032
01:37:57,690 --> 01:37:58,790
It's there, baby.

2033
01:37:59,510 --> 01:38:00,390
Oh my god.

2034
01:38:00,630 --> 01:38:02,910
Psycho Mantis looks so cute though.

2035
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:05,770
He looks really...

2036
01:38:06,710 --> 01:38:07,230
Like...

2037
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:09,550
When you see his outfit...

2038
01:38:10,650 --> 01:38:12,410
He looks kind of...

2039
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:14,770
He looks kind of...

2040
01:38:16,270 --> 01:38:17,570
This guy doesn't wear shoes.

2041
01:38:18,110 --> 01:38:18,230
This guy doesn't wear shoes.

2042
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:19,830
What a freak.

2043
01:38:19,970 --> 01:38:20,330
I know!

2044
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:22,790
He looks really freaky.

2045
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:24,090
Can't achieve anything?

2046
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:27,030
He puts his mind to psychic menace.

2047
01:38:27,770 --> 01:38:28,950
What a menace.

2048
01:38:29,090 --> 01:38:29,470
Oh my gosh.

2049
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:30,770
The underside is so cute too.

2050
01:38:32,370 --> 01:38:34,170
There's so much attention to detail here.

2051
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:38,270
Why are you...

2052
01:38:39,530 --> 01:38:40,530
Why are you...

2053
01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:40,830
Why are you doing that?

2054
01:38:40,950 --> 01:38:42,270
Why are you doing that motion?

2055
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:48,780
Why is he thrusting?

2056
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:51,340
Vampire killer.

2057
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:53,040
He looks sassy.

2058
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:53,620
His eyes.

2059
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:55,600
So cute.

2060
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:57,420
Classy.

2061
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:01,300
Oh look it.

2062
01:39:01,340 --> 01:39:01,660
Ratchet.

2063
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:03,380
Oh my gosh.

2064
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:04,140
So cute.

2065
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,800
Oh they look so cute.

2066
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:10,340
Oh my gosh.

2067
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:13,720
Even like the smudge marks on the back of the little robot.

2068
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:14,300
Oh my gosh.

2069
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:15,660
Wow.

2070
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:18,340
It looks so good.

2071
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,760
It looks so good.

2072
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:25,400
It looks so good.

2073
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:25,500
Cute.

2074
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:27,080
Cute.

2075
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:27,500
Cute.

2076
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:30,500
So cute.

2077
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:33,100
So happy.

2078
01:39:33,460 --> 01:39:33,640
So happy.

2079
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:34,240
Yeah.

2080
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:38,020
Psycho Mantis actually helped us.

2081
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:38,680
I know.

2082
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:39,400
Oh wait.

2083
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:40,560
And then we have Blood Board Man.

2084
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:50,940
None of them are wearing shoes, huh?

2085
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:54,060
Look at the detail on his hat.

2086
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:55,420
It looks like real leather.

2087
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:57,320
Wow.

2088
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:59,380
The texture on his coat.

2089
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:00,620
Wow.

2090
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:03,980
There's so much detail put into these little guys.

2091
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:08,700
There's so much detail put into these little guys.

2092
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:09,900
There's so much detail put into these little guys.

2093
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:10,340
I'm so excited.

2094
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:12,900
Nice.

2095
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:19,340
Oh we just need two guys here.

2096
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:23,380
Oh and me?

2097
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:29,320
There's so many puzzle pieces just in this one spot.

2098
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:34,740
The music here is so epic.

2099
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:36,360
The chorus.

2100
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:36,940
Oh my gosh.

2101
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:42,400
I want the soundtrack to this game.

2102
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:45,340
This sounds so good.

2103
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:47,860
So

2104
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:58,060
clearly we have more areas.

2105
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:00,260
But let's go back to our spaceship.

2106
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:06,340
Clank is also voiced by Beasties Megatron in this show movie, eh?

2107
01:41:06,980 --> 01:41:07,820
No way!

2108
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:10,540
Beasties.

2109
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:21,560
I love Beast Wars.

2110
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:24,920
Okay.

2111
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:26,000
Let's go!

2112
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:32,460
Beasties.

2113
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:37,660
Should we go back to where we came from?

2114
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,540
We were in the monkey world.

2115
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:44,460
Which one was the planet that we didn't finish?

2116
01:41:57,460 --> 01:41:58,660
This one.

2117
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:00,340
Ice cream.

2118
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:04,840
Ice cream.

2119
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:05,820
Ice cream.

2120
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:06,940
You scream.

2121
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:09,340
We're all screaming because we're gonna crash!

2122
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:15,620
200 coins for what?

2123
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:20,860
Wait.

2124
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:21,260
Somebody.

2125
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:21,960
What is this?

2126
01:42:27,990 --> 01:42:28,950
What is this?

2127
01:42:30,630 --> 01:42:31,710
Don't touch me.

2128
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:38,550
A guide?

2129
01:42:51,140 --> 01:42:52,160
A bird?

2130
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:52,960
A pet?

2131
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:53,040
What?

2132
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:54,660
Look!

2133
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:55,380
There's one in here!

2134
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:57,220
I don't think we noticed this one before.

2135
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:00,180
Oh.

2136
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:00,540
Hold on.

2137
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:03,020
Come here.

2138
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:04,080
Come here.

2139
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:06,400
Come here.

2140
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:06,780
There we go.

2141
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:08,080
Come here.

2142
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:14,240
Nice!

2143
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:16,920
Hint bird?

2144
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:17,480
Oh.

2145
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:18,400
He's like...

2146
01:43:19,540 --> 01:43:20,080
He's like...

2147
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:22,680
No.

2148
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:23,200
Hold on.

2149
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:24,560
I'm trying to... I'm trying to...

2150
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:25,080
No.

2151
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:26,400
I'm trying to get him in the hole.

2152
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:28,460
Why is it so hard?

2153
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:30,800
Why is it so hard?

2154
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:32,500
What was this one again?

2155
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:34,180
What was this one again?

2156
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:35,040
Oh.

2157
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:36,160
The puzzle piece we already got.

2158
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:36,620
Oh.

2159
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:37,900
But we get more coins for it.

2160
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:38,200
Okay.

2161
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:38,720
That's enough.

2162
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:42,740
Okay.

2163
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:42,760
That's enough.

2164
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:45,120
Okay.

2165
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:48,460
So the...

2166
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:51,000
This guy has got to be around here somewhere.

2167
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:02,340
This guy has got to be around here somewhere.

2168
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:02,480
This guy has got to be around here somewhere.

2169
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:02,800
Yeah.

2170
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:09,180
The bird was hinting at below.

2171
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:09,740
Yeah.

2172
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:10,040
Oh.

2173
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:11,560
That was close.

2174
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:15,320
Like he was like...

2175
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:16,480
At the wall, right?

2176
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:17,320
Here.

2177
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:17,660
Yeah.

2178
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:21,200
Here at the wall.

2179
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:22,940
Wait.

2180
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:23,460
I just noticed.

2181
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:24,840
Maybe there.

2182
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:27,360
Oh.

2183
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:27,620
Oh.

2184
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:27,880
Oh.

2185
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:28,360
Oh.

2186
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:29,360
Oh.

2187
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:29,640
Oh.

2188
01:44:39,580 --> 01:44:40,020
Okay.

2189
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:40,360
Good.

2190
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:40,580
Good.

2191
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:40,780
Good.

2192
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:41,500
Okay.

2193
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:41,500
Good.

2194
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:41,500
Good.

2195
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:41,500
Good.

2196
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:41,680
Good.

2197
01:44:47,870 --> 01:44:48,310
Good.

2198
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:48,370
Good.

2199
01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:48,370
Good.

2200
01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:48,370
Good.

2201
01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:48,370
Good.

2202
01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:48,370
Good.

2203
01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:48,370
Good.

2204
01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:48,370
Good.

2205
01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:48,370
Good.

2206
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:48,470
Okay.

2207
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:48,750
Perfect.

2208
01:44:50,770 --> 01:44:52,730
Then we just have the last...

2209
01:44:52,730 --> 01:44:54,350
I don't even think we beat the level.

2210
01:44:54,510 --> 01:44:55,950
So... technically.

2211
01:44:57,390 --> 01:44:58,330
Like we...

2212
01:44:58,330 --> 01:45:00,390
Didn't even get it to the very end.

2213
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:01,790
So let's go do that.

2214
01:45:05,350 --> 01:45:05,870
Jinja!

2215
01:45:06,710 --> 01:45:08,450
Welcome back for two months.

2216
01:45:08,630 --> 01:45:09,330
Thank you!

2217
01:45:12,490 --> 01:45:13,130
Thank you.

2218
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:13,790
Thank you so much!

2219
01:45:30,970 --> 01:45:31,490
There!

2220
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:34,030
Now eat the bird.

2221
01:45:34,450 --> 01:45:35,370
No, he's gonna help us still.

2222
01:45:36,450 --> 01:45:37,330
Just a little bit.

2223
01:45:37,450 --> 01:45:37,850
Probably.

2224
01:45:40,830 --> 01:45:41,730
Oh, that's nice.

2225
01:45:41,830 --> 01:45:43,850
So you can just keep coming back to these.

2226
01:45:44,150 --> 01:45:45,130
And like...

2227
01:45:45,130 --> 01:45:45,990
Oh.

2228
01:45:49,230 --> 01:45:50,150
I've got...

2229
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:51,730
You!

2230
01:45:55,290 --> 01:45:57,890
You can just keep coming back and like farming coins.

2231
01:45:59,230 --> 01:46:00,630
I could use some ice cream.

2232
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:01,530
Mmm.

2233
01:46:03,210 --> 01:46:03,670
Wait.

2234
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:09,200
Oh!

2235
01:46:09,380 --> 01:46:14,720
I think we're gonna go in.

2236
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:18,700
Going in was what made us go into a different dimension.

2237
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:19,780
Right?

2238
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:23,480
Right?

2239
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:26,500
It wasn't going in what made us go to the mushroom world.

2240
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:34,620
No need to dig?

2241
01:46:34,740 --> 01:46:34,900
Okay.

2242
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:36,500
What about here?

2243
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:39,720
This was also where we discovered somebody.

2244
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:42,060
Yeah!

2245
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:43,500
There's a lot of coins in here.

2246
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:47,100
Yeah!

2247
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:50,680
Why not?

2248
01:46:50,860 --> 01:46:51,280
We're here.

2249
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:52,780
Yeah!

2250
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:54,040
Okay, bye.

2251
01:46:58,810 --> 01:46:59,530
It's okay.

2252
01:46:59,970 --> 01:47:01,390
We don't have to go through there.

2253
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:07,520
Wee!

2254
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:08,900
Is

2255
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:18,960
that my bird talking?

2256
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:19,540
Or...

2257
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:28,560
Someone is...

2258
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,520
Oh, there's a bird up there chirping.

2259
01:47:34,510 --> 01:47:35,130
Okay.

2260
01:47:36,890 --> 01:47:38,310
There's that bird right there.

2261
01:47:40,950 --> 01:47:41,330
Yeah!

2262
01:47:42,130 --> 01:47:42,730
Hahaha.

2263
01:47:43,690 --> 01:47:45,410
So much ladybug bullying.

2264
01:47:47,950 --> 01:47:49,490
Ladybugs scare me, so...

2265
01:47:49,490 --> 01:47:51,510
I don't mind it so much.

2266
01:47:51,630 --> 01:47:52,050
Hahaha.

2267
01:47:52,450 --> 01:47:53,310
Sorry, Barry.

2268
01:47:56,030 --> 01:47:56,990
Oh my god!

2269
01:47:57,170 --> 01:47:58,110
Oh my god!

2270
01:47:58,970 --> 01:48:00,630
Oh, he just murdered that guy!

2271
01:48:08,810 --> 01:48:09,770
Oh my god.

2272
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:11,410
The pig ate the bot.

2273
01:48:12,550 --> 01:48:14,270
The pig ate the bot!

2274
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:20,650
Oh my god.

2275
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:21,630
Where did you guys come from?

2276
01:48:30,030 --> 01:48:30,470
Yeah!

2277
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:33,830
Yeah!

2278
01:48:34,370 --> 01:48:38,090
Oh, there he is!

2279
01:48:40,450 --> 01:48:41,050
Help me!

2280
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:44,190
We got him.

2281
01:48:44,650 --> 01:48:45,870
Astro Bot looks so fun.

2282
01:48:45,990 --> 01:48:47,470
This game is actually so fun.

2283
01:48:51,310 --> 01:48:53,070
This game is actually so fun.

2284
01:48:54,150 --> 01:48:54,590
Boing!

2285
01:48:54,590 --> 01:48:54,810
Boing!

2286
01:48:56,030 --> 01:48:56,470
All

2287
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:02,160
of our guys...

2288
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:03,260
Oh my god, Snake, what are you doing?

2289
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:05,100
Oh my god, Psychobat, what are you doing?

2290
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:08,060
Oh, okay.

2291
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:09,580
Snake's like, come on!

2292
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:10,040
Come on!

2293
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:11,180
Meow!

2294
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:11,800
Meow!

2295
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:13,280
Hold on tight, Grayfaw!

2296
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:18,940
Really?

2297
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:20,740
Really?

2298
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:21,580
That bird?

2299
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:23,680
That bird cheated me.

2300
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:24,700
Hahaha.

2301
01:49:25,580 --> 01:49:27,120
That bird cheated me!

2302
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:28,340
Hahaha.

2303
01:49:28,340 --> 01:49:28,440
Hahaha.

2304
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:29,720
Hahaha.

2305
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:32,240
What?

2306
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:36,000
Okay, let's go to this place.

2307
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:42,200
Wahoo!

2308
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:44,760
Knock

2309
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:00,440
knock!

2310
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:02,540
Oh!

2311
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:07,820
Oh wait, I feel it.

2312
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:09,700
There, this one.

2313
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:10,940
Wait.

2314
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:13,300
Wait.

2315
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:15,400
This...

2316
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:16,720
Oh, I push.

2317
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:17,360
I just push it.

2318
01:50:17,460 --> 01:50:17,840
Hahaha.

2319
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:19,620
I just push it.

2320
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:20,380
Hmm.

2321
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,200
Interesting.

2322
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:24,880
Hmm.

2323
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:40,240
What about you, bird?

2324
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:43,780
Thank you.

2325
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:44,060
Thank you.

2326
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:45,740
I like the door's design.

2327
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:46,260
Yeah!

2328
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:47,320
It's so cool.

2329
01:50:59,070 --> 01:51:00,190
Put him in top...

2330
01:51:00,190 --> 01:51:00,810
Put him in here.

2331
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:06,760
I got you!

2332
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:09,060
They turn around!

2333
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:10,280
They literally turn around!

2334
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:11,300
And wait to get slapped!

2335
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:13,500
They're just like...

2336
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:14,240
Yeah!

2337
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:14,740
Come here!

2338
01:51:15,180 --> 01:51:15,900
Maboot!

2339
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:17,360
Wow!

2340
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:18,800
All the leaves!

2341
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:19,500
So cool!

2342
01:51:20,660 --> 01:51:20,820
Hahaha.

2343
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:22,940
Maboot!

2344
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:24,240
Maboot!

2345
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:25,620
Maboot!

2346
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:28,820
They sound like Blue from Blue's Clues.

2347
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:30,840
Maboot!

2348
01:51:32,740 --> 01:51:33,460
Maboot!

2349
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:38,540
Sorry, little geckos.

2350
01:51:44,570 --> 01:51:46,010
Sorry, little geckos.

2351
01:51:46,010 --> 01:51:46,630
So awesome!

2352
01:51:47,670 --> 01:51:48,530
Who is it?

2353
01:51:48,550 --> 01:51:48,910
Who is it?

2354
01:51:48,930 --> 01:51:49,310
Who is it?

2355
01:51:50,930 --> 01:51:51,870
It's not who.

2356
01:51:53,110 --> 01:51:54,030
I've got...

2357
01:51:54,030 --> 01:51:55,370
I've got chompers.

2358
01:51:56,270 --> 01:51:56,810
What?

2359
01:51:56,870 --> 01:51:57,750
What do they do?

2360
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:16,120
Awesome.

2361
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:18,740
Never mind.

2362
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:19,660
Oh!

2363
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:21,140
Yes, mind!

2364
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:22,660
I was correct.

2365
01:52:23,940 --> 01:52:25,740
We gotta look around everywhere.

2366
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:28,040
Make sure we're getting everything, you guys.

2367
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:31,760
Make sure we're getting everything, you guys.

2368
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:31,860
Oh!

2369
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:33,440
Oh!

2370
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:35,300
Hahaha.

2371
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:44,880
I just did something.

2372
01:52:45,700 --> 01:52:47,520
I don't know what that just did, actually.

2373
01:52:48,820 --> 01:52:49,540
Ah!

2374
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:52,220
The little monkey!

2375
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:54,080
Hahaha.

2376
01:52:55,860 --> 01:52:57,340
Freaky ghost maid.

2377
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:58,600
That's my name.

2378
01:53:05,470 --> 01:53:06,530
That frog.

2379
01:53:09,270 --> 01:53:09,990
Sorry.

2380
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:17,180
Where did those birds go?

2381
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:19,740
Oh!

2382
01:53:25,650 --> 01:53:26,330
Bless you.

2383
01:53:26,510 --> 01:53:27,030
Thank you!

2384
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:37,800
I used to never be able to...

2385
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:42,800
I used to never be able to...

2386
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:43,520
I used to never be able to sneeze on stream.

2387
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:43,940
I used to never be able to sneeze on stream.

2388
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:45,960
Now, recently I've only been...

2389
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:46,040
Now, recently I've only been...

2390
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:46,560
Oh, not streaming.

2391
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:47,700
Sneezing.

2392
01:53:56,860 --> 01:53:57,380
Nice!

2393
01:53:59,140 --> 01:54:01,020
Let's do this one first.

2394
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:01,920
Okay.

2395
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:03,040
Wait!

2396
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:11,940
Whoever said it was like Crash?

2397
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:14,100
You were so right!

2398
01:54:14,980 --> 01:54:16,220
Why was...

2399
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:17,240
Why was...

2400
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:22,500
Wait, Snake was probably on the ice cream because Shadow Moses is in Alaska!

2401
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,660
And then...

2402
01:54:24,660 --> 01:54:26,160
Oh my god!

2403
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:27,040
It makes sense!

2404
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:30,520
And also because he's obsessed with me because I'm Mint!

2405
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:34,780
Yay!

2406
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:36,220
We got Crash!

2407
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:38,160
Spinning marsupial.

2408
01:54:38,300 --> 01:54:40,920
Not to be confused with a naughty dog.

2409
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:45,580
Not to be confused with a naughty dog.

2410
01:54:48,300 --> 01:54:50,080
That was like straight up him though.

2411
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:51,400
That wasn't even like a...

2412
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:54,380
Like he didn't even look like a bot.

2413
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:57,040
It just looked like him, you know?

2414
01:54:57,580 --> 01:54:58,100
It just looked like him, you know?

2415
01:55:01,580 --> 01:55:04,280
I can't tell if we can go to these other highlands or not.

2416
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:05,020
Maybe not.

2417
01:55:05,020 --> 01:55:06,140
Okay.

2418
01:55:12,940 --> 01:55:13,640
Onwards!

2419
01:55:13,660 --> 01:55:14,160
Forwards!

2420
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:19,120
Oh neat!

2421
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:22,660
What's this?

2422
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:32,140
You're welcome!

2423
01:55:32,820 --> 01:55:35,020
I'm so benevolent.

2424
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:38,600
Okay, we need this.

2425
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:39,580
Oh, maybe...

2426
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:40,180
Okay, hold on.

2427
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:42,680
Probably to take down...

2428
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:45,920
Probably to get that up there, right?

2429
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:47,140
Yeah!

2430
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:48,660
We

2431
01:55:55,410 --> 01:55:56,490
already missed a guy!

2432
01:55:56,770 --> 01:55:58,090
Oh my god!

2433
01:55:58,330 --> 01:55:59,990
I was gonna say, so far so good!

2434
01:56:00,070 --> 01:56:03,210
I was literally two seconds away from being like Alright!

2435
01:56:03,670 --> 01:56:04,990
So far so good!

2436
01:56:06,090 --> 01:56:07,490
How the heck?

2437
01:56:07,630 --> 01:56:08,810
Who did we miss?

2438
01:56:17,740 --> 01:56:20,240
Who did we miss?

2439
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:22,000
Who did we miss?

2440
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,940
Who did we miss?

2441
01:56:24,940 --> 01:56:25,840
In here?

2442
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:28,380
No, this is...

2443
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:32,420
Look at these little lizards.

2444
01:56:32,420 --> 01:56:32,980
Love them.

2445
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:36,060
That guy was there.

2446
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:40,340
I need a hint bird.

2447
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:41,680
I need a hint bird.

2448
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:44,640
I need a hint bird.

2449
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:45,700
You think he's...

2450
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:46,980
Maybe...

2451
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:48,960
No, stop it!

2452
01:56:49,180 --> 01:56:52,440
No, stop it!

2453
01:56:56,180 --> 01:56:57,300
Inside his teeth?

2454
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:02,160
He's near crash?

2455
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:02,980
Oh, okay.

2456
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:03,440
Thank you.

2457
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:05,860
Near crash, eh?

2458
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:08,980
Near crash...

2459
01:57:11,140 --> 01:57:13,280
He's like dangling for his life.

2460
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:18,520
Wait, did I just hear a guy?

2461
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:19,940
Did I just hear a guy?

2462
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:21,520
Did that again?

2463
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:29,720
Like how near crash are we talking?

2464
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:31,760
Like how near crash are we talking?

2465
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:32,320
I

2466
01:57:40,310 --> 01:57:41,430
think I'm going crazy.

2467
01:57:41,730 --> 01:57:41,810
I think I'm going crazy.

2468
01:57:42,270 --> 01:57:45,730
I see a box there, but I don't see a guy.

2469
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:49,250
A waterfall?

2470
01:57:53,010 --> 01:57:54,950
Well, let's get that box first.

2471
01:57:56,350 --> 01:57:56,910
Oh

2472
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:10,220
my gosh, he's in here!

2473
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:12,980
You sneaky!

2474
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:14,060
You're so sneaky!

2475
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:16,620
You sneaky!

2476
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:16,620
You're so sneaky!

2477
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:16,880
Nice.

2478
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:20,660
Okay, now we can continue onward.

2479
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:21,000
Okay, now we can continue onward.

2480
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,780
Well, I should start checking more periodically.

2481
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:27,700
Oh, oops.

2482
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:29,320
Otherwise, I'll forget.

2483
01:58:31,960 --> 01:58:32,460
Okay.

2484
01:58:37,030 --> 01:58:40,170
Next Minto panel at a con, everyone is going to floss in front of you.

2485
01:58:40,270 --> 01:58:40,310
Next Minto panel at a con, everyone is going to floss in front of you.

2486
01:58:40,310 --> 01:58:41,210
Don't say that.

2487
01:58:41,210 --> 01:58:42,910
That's so rude.

2488
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:54,980
Nice.

2489
01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:57,020
What is this thing?

2490
01:58:58,420 --> 01:58:58,780
Oh,

2491
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:04,230
it's a Matryoshka doll!

2492
01:59:05,770 --> 01:59:06,450
Cute.

2493
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:15,340
Floss for the boss.

2494
01:59:15,820 --> 01:59:16,480
No!

2495
01:59:17,220 --> 01:59:20,020
The boss does not wish this on you!

2496
01:59:21,680 --> 01:59:25,160
You gotta put the freak phantom glasses on, ma'am.

2497
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:26,420
Why?

2498
01:59:26,620 --> 01:59:26,720
Why?

2499
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:27,600
What did I do this time?

2500
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:30,400
What did I do this time?

2501
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:34,440
What's going on?

2502
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:45,040
That's right.

2503
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:47,520
Slap your butt.

2504
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:50,560
Slap your butt.

2505
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:55,100
Donations feel a little delayed.

2506
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:55,780
I think they are.

2507
01:59:57,580 --> 02:00:01,240
It's because there was a bunch of gifted membership.

2508
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:03,940
It's because there was a bunch of gifted membership.

2509
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:04,500
Up...

2510
02:00:07,250 --> 02:00:07,690
Wow.

2511
02:00:09,990 --> 02:00:10,810
First try, baby.

2512
02:00:13,670 --> 02:00:14,110
Oh.

2513
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:18,680
Up.

2514
02:00:34,820 --> 02:00:36,200
The crowd goes mild.

2515
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:38,960
Oh my God.

2516
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:45,260
I'll get you out of there.

2517
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:47,760
How do I get you out of there?

2518
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:50,520
There we go.

2519
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:53,400
Stop horsing around.

2520
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:56,380
I'm actually having a thank you for the Five-Gifted.

2521
02:00:56,380 --> 02:00:56,600
Thank you.

2522
02:00:56,600 --> 02:00:58,580
Yo, big boss man.

2523
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:01,120
As a fellow gamer, what's your take on the PS5 Pro?

2524
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:03,840
And the ridiculous price of $700.

2525
02:01:04,140 --> 02:01:06,160
Also, no describe and stand.

2526
02:01:06,580 --> 02:01:07,300
What are you talking about?

2527
02:01:07,340 --> 02:01:07,860
There's a stand?

2528
02:01:08,100 --> 02:01:10,240
You just gotta pay 30 extra dollars for it.

2529
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:30,640
That was an announcement.

2530
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:39,200
That was an announcement, wasn't it, you guys?

2531
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:42,400
All

2532
02:02:01,340 --> 02:02:02,580
things, you know...

2533
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:06,140
Whoops, sorry, I wasn't really paying attention.

2534
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:13,200
All jokes aside, I know that there's not so much on the PS5.

2535
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:15,760
And maybe that's being kind about it.

2536
02:02:16,020 --> 02:02:20,360
But also, I'm really excited to play Delta on it.

2537
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:20,900
So...

2538
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:25,320
And quite honestly, I...

2539
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:27,580
Okay, this is...

2540
02:02:27,580 --> 02:02:29,900
Oh my gosh, I'm so embarrassed to admit this.

2541
02:02:30,120 --> 02:02:31,720
I wasn't gonna admit this, okay?

2542
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:34,400
I wasn't going to admit this.

2543
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:35,720
But I've...

2544
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:38,160
I...

2545
02:02:38,860 --> 02:02:40,040
I thought...

2546
02:02:40,630 --> 02:02:42,800
I thought Delta was gonna...

2547
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:48,820
I thought it was gonna be a PS5 exclusive for some reason.

2548
02:02:49,320 --> 02:02:51,440
I made that up in my brain.

2549
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:54,060
And so I was like, oh, well, I gotta get it.

2550
02:03:12,270 --> 02:03:13,630
But now I can play this game.

2551
02:03:15,430 --> 02:03:15,850
Oh, oh.

2552
02:03:15,950 --> 02:03:16,610
Oh, oh, oh.

2553
02:03:17,050 --> 02:03:17,290
Whoa.

2554
02:03:17,570 --> 02:03:17,970
Wait.

2555
02:03:18,170 --> 02:03:18,570
Wait.

2556
02:03:18,770 --> 02:03:19,170
Ow.

2557
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:19,710
Wait.

2558
02:03:19,810 --> 02:03:20,090
Ow.

2559
02:03:20,430 --> 02:03:20,830
Oh.

2560
02:03:21,130 --> 02:03:21,990
Oh, that was close.

2561
02:03:22,650 --> 02:03:23,410
That was close.

2562
02:03:23,470 --> 02:03:23,910
That was close.

2563
02:03:24,970 --> 02:03:25,990
What is over here?

2564
02:03:26,170 --> 02:03:26,890
There's something...

2565
02:03:26,890 --> 02:03:28,030
There's gotta be something up there.

2566
02:03:30,470 --> 02:03:31,770
There's gotta be something there.

2567
02:03:32,170 --> 02:03:33,010
But, you know...

2568
02:03:33,510 --> 02:03:34,170
It's fine.

2569
02:03:38,730 --> 02:03:39,810
It's fine, though.

2570
02:03:43,050 --> 02:03:44,010
It's all good.

2571
02:03:45,590 --> 02:03:46,950
As for the pro...

2572
02:03:46,950 --> 02:03:49,390
I have this, so I don't need it.

2573
02:03:52,850 --> 02:03:54,950
And it's also a lot of money.

2574
02:03:56,430 --> 02:03:56,950
How

2575
02:04:01,300 --> 02:04:02,420
I can get up there?

2576
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:10,500
He's so scary in there.

2577
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:12,760
It's a bunch of regular guns.

2578
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:13,140
Guys.

2579
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:19,020
And then just Crash Bandicoot staring at me like that Smile movie.

2580
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:20,680
It looks so creepy.

2581
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:23,400
The platform?

2582
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:25,860
Oh, my God.

2583
02:04:27,980 --> 02:04:29,420
Is it good?

2584
02:04:34,360 --> 02:04:35,000
Wait.

2585
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:35,980
That wasn't...

2586
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:36,220
Okay.

2587
02:04:36,280 --> 02:04:36,460
Good.

2588
02:04:36,540 --> 02:04:37,580
We just have one more guy.

2589
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:39,660
We just have one more guy.

2590
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:47,000
Oh, gosh.

2591
02:04:47,260 --> 02:04:47,860
Oh.

2592
02:04:48,160 --> 02:04:48,540
Oh.

2593
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:51,040
That was...

2594
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:51,260
That was...

2595
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:51,460
That was close.

2596
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:57,700
Oh, my God.

2597
02:04:57,820 --> 02:04:58,120
Wait.

2598
02:04:58,180 --> 02:04:58,940
I wasn't ready for that.

2599
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:00,620
I wasn't ready.

2600
02:05:01,860 --> 02:05:02,300
Oh.

2601
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:04,400
Somehow I made it.

2602
02:05:06,140 --> 02:05:06,580
Oh.

2603
02:05:06,700 --> 02:05:07,660
Why did it get so dark?

2604
02:05:10,460 --> 02:05:13,440
Someone's slowly making their way through the MGS1 on...

2605
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:14,920
Through MGS1 on the Master Collection.

2606
02:05:15,140 --> 02:05:17,960
Would it be better to play the OG Snake either first or just play Delta?

2607
02:05:18,440 --> 02:05:19,320
I think...

2608
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:21,000
I think...

2609
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:27,800
I think...

2610
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:28,240
You...

2611
02:05:28,240 --> 02:05:28,320
I think...

2612
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:31,080
You could do whichever one you wanted, to be honest, actually.

2613
02:05:36,740 --> 02:05:38,660
I'm wanting to punch this thing here.

2614
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:38,920
Oh.

2615
02:05:38,940 --> 02:05:39,180
Oops.

2616
02:05:39,580 --> 02:05:40,840
I'm wanting to punch...

2617
02:05:43,220 --> 02:05:43,860
This here.

2618
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:44,900
Oh.

2619
02:05:44,980 --> 02:05:45,320
Okay.

2620
02:05:45,380 --> 02:05:45,740
Never mind.

2621
02:05:45,780 --> 02:05:46,280
It doesn't do anything.

2622
02:05:46,540 --> 02:05:47,180
I thought it might.

2623
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:48,860
Worth a shot.

2624
02:05:49,040 --> 02:05:49,300
Okay.

2625
02:05:50,980 --> 02:05:51,380
Um...

2626
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:55,560
According to some wisps, you should start at the...

2627
02:05:57,460 --> 02:05:58,940
Those wisps are raw.

2628
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:01,260
That's what I do to those wisps.

2629
02:06:01,340 --> 02:06:01,680
Oh.

2630
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:02,780
Okay.

2631
02:06:02,900 --> 02:06:03,320
I give them the old...

2632
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:03,780
One-two!

2633
02:06:03,900 --> 02:06:04,360
One-two!

2634
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:11,360
Wait a second.

2635
02:06:21,250 --> 02:06:21,730
Oh.

2636
02:06:21,810 --> 02:06:22,030
Okay.

2637
02:06:22,090 --> 02:06:22,890
That's where we got that.

2638
02:06:23,030 --> 02:06:23,250
Okay.

2639
02:06:23,250 --> 02:06:23,530
Just kidding.

2640
02:06:28,710 --> 02:06:29,390
Woo-hoo.

2641
02:06:31,370 --> 02:06:31,850
Monkeys...

2642
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:32,130
Whoa.

2643
02:06:32,890 --> 02:06:33,370
Monkey...

2644
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:34,890
Monkeys...

2645
02:06:34,890 --> 02:06:35,790
Monkeys...

2646
02:06:35,790 --> 02:06:36,890
Oh, monkeys.

2647
02:06:37,710 --> 02:06:38,190
Um.

2648
02:06:38,210 --> 02:06:38,790
I'm gonna...

2649
02:06:39,690 --> 02:06:40,170
Um...

2650
02:06:47,750 --> 02:06:48,710
Excuse me.

2651
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:52,880
Ugh.

2652
02:06:53,600 --> 02:06:54,080
Uh.

2653
02:07:03,770 --> 02:07:05,270
Oh my gosh, that was close.

2654
02:07:05,410 --> 02:07:05,830
There we go.

2655
02:07:05,950 --> 02:07:06,750
Okay, we got it.

2656
02:07:11,110 --> 02:07:11,990
If you

2657
02:07:20,370 --> 02:07:25,390
play the OG, the original 3 first, you might appreciate it a bit more.

2658
02:07:25,550 --> 02:07:26,010
You know what I mean?

2659
02:07:26,670 --> 02:07:29,530
If you're going through and then you could...

2660
02:07:29,970 --> 02:07:30,710
What's in here?

2661
02:07:34,570 --> 02:07:35,010
Secret...

2662
02:07:35,010 --> 02:07:35,930
Oh...

2663
02:07:43,770 --> 02:07:44,490
Secret...

2664
02:07:47,710 --> 02:07:48,650
Oh my god!

2665
02:07:49,350 --> 02:07:49,710
Oh

2666
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:57,320
gosh!

2667
02:07:57,580 --> 02:07:58,200
Oh gosh, okay.

2668
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:02,880
Okay, we got this.

2669
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:06,340
Okay, we got this.

2670
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:09,940
Alright!

2671
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:12,560
Okay!

2672
02:08:23,550 --> 02:08:24,730
That was so close!

2673
02:08:34,420 --> 02:08:36,420
Okay, how do I do this then?

2674
02:08:49,390 --> 02:08:50,770
Oh my gosh, I see him up there!

2675
02:08:51,350 --> 02:08:52,050
It's Jack!

2676
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:53,210
Right?

2677
02:08:53,350 --> 02:08:54,110
From Jack and...

2678
02:08:54,110 --> 02:08:55,990
Wait, yeah, Jack and... It's Jack!

2679
02:08:56,630 --> 02:08:57,470
Jack and Daxter!

2680
02:08:57,950 --> 02:08:58,310
Jacks?

2681
02:08:58,630 --> 02:08:58,990
Jacks?

2682
02:08:59,090 --> 02:08:59,770
Jacks and Dax?

2683
02:08:59,850 --> 02:09:00,330
Wait, Jack?

2684
02:09:00,470 --> 02:09:00,990
It's Jack, right?

2685
02:09:03,490 --> 02:09:04,650
I see him right there!

2686
02:09:04,710 --> 02:09:05,370
He looks so scared!

2687
02:09:05,650 --> 02:09:06,550
Wait, oh gosh.

2688
02:09:06,730 --> 02:09:07,570
How do I do this part?

2689
02:09:07,710 --> 02:09:07,870
Okay.

2690
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:15,180
That was so close!

2691
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:17,880
Dang it, I have to do the whole thing over again.

2692
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:19,300
Okay, we got this.

2693
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:19,800
We got this.

2694
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:20,180
We got this.

2695
02:09:21,440 --> 02:09:21,760
Secret...

2696
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:23,520
Secret...

2697
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:42,140
This one's hard.

2698
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:45,880
Luckily, it's not so hard to get back to it, but...

2699
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:48,440
It's... maybe...

2700
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,740
Yeah, I think you can land on the red beam.

2701
02:09:51,820 --> 02:09:52,320
I think so too.

2702
02:09:55,020 --> 02:09:55,700
Yeah!

2703
02:09:56,240 --> 02:09:57,700
I just have to be careful.

2704
02:09:58,200 --> 02:09:58,880
Yeah!

2705
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,680
Punch!

2706
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:01,680
Yeah!

2707
02:10:07,090 --> 02:10:11,230
Eco Warrior left a legacy worthy of the precursors.

2708
02:10:11,870 --> 02:10:12,990
There he is.

2709
02:10:13,690 --> 02:10:16,050
He's just in there, looking so cute.

2710
02:10:16,170 --> 02:10:18,330
Why is Crash so scary looking?

2711
02:10:18,710 --> 02:10:21,530
He's like eating his body right now.

2712
02:10:24,330 --> 02:10:25,190
Oh god.

2713
02:10:26,210 --> 02:10:27,690
What did they do to you, Crash?

2714
02:10:33,950 --> 02:10:34,610
Okie dokie.

2715
02:10:35,510 --> 02:10:36,750
Alright, here we go.

2716
02:10:39,910 --> 02:10:41,550
Here we go, baby.

2717
02:10:41,790 --> 02:10:42,270
Here we go.

2718
02:10:42,310 --> 02:10:43,250
The monkeys are excited.

2719
02:10:43,450 --> 02:10:44,830
The monkeys are excited for us.

2720
02:11:02,540 --> 02:11:03,300
Oh my gosh.

2721
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:04,000
Oh my gosh.

2722
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:30,700
Don't just cheer, you guys!

2723
02:11:30,780 --> 02:11:31,300
You sickos!

2724
02:11:33,240 --> 02:11:33,760
Yeah!

2725
02:11:42,910 --> 02:11:44,030
Kicked his butt!

2726
02:11:44,170 --> 02:11:45,470
We wiped his butt, everybody.

2727
02:11:45,570 --> 02:11:46,290
We wiped it.

2728
02:11:46,310 --> 02:11:46,930
We wiped it.

2729
02:11:47,030 --> 02:11:49,490
We wiped the floor with his butt.

2730
02:11:49,710 --> 02:11:50,150
Let's go!

2731
02:11:55,290 --> 02:11:57,750
Oh my god, Crash is flossing.

2732
02:12:11,350 --> 02:12:11,870
How...

2733
02:12:12,870 --> 02:12:14,430
What did we do on this planet?

2734
02:12:14,830 --> 02:12:15,350
No!

2735
02:12:16,170 --> 02:12:17,190
What did we miss?

2736
02:12:20,830 --> 02:12:22,390
We missed the puzzle pieces.

2737
02:12:23,590 --> 02:12:24,290
That's okay.

2738
02:12:24,930 --> 02:12:26,150
We don't have to get everything.

2739
02:12:26,450 --> 02:12:27,590
First try, you know.

2740
02:12:28,810 --> 02:12:29,650
Puzzle pieces.

2741
02:12:29,850 --> 02:12:30,490
The puzzle pieces.

2742
02:12:31,130 --> 02:12:32,770
And it said that there was a warp.

2743
02:12:37,410 --> 02:12:38,450
Get that!

2744
02:12:39,150 --> 02:12:39,910
Get that!

2745
02:12:40,470 --> 02:12:41,350
Oh, avoid that!

2746
02:12:41,350 --> 02:12:42,170
Get...

2747
02:12:42,170 --> 02:12:43,410
Get that!

2748
02:12:44,830 --> 02:12:45,690
Avoid that!

2749
02:12:46,290 --> 02:12:48,070
Oh my gosh, I like how there's an intro.

2750
02:12:48,310 --> 02:12:48,850
Or like a...

2751
02:12:50,390 --> 02:12:52,350
I like that there's a little...

2752
02:12:54,690 --> 02:12:57,410
Like mini-game kind of thing when you come in too.

2753
02:12:57,730 --> 02:12:58,190
Oops, sorry.

2754
02:12:59,930 --> 02:13:00,410
Sorry.

2755
02:13:00,710 --> 02:13:01,130
Sorry.

2756
02:13:02,750 --> 02:13:03,350
Destruction's over.

2757
02:13:03,770 --> 02:13:04,250
Sorry.

2758
02:13:05,030 --> 02:13:05,510
Sorry.

2759
02:13:10,200 --> 02:13:11,500
Wait till you see the boss?

2760
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:12,360
Wait, what do you mean?

2761
02:13:12,720 --> 02:13:12,940
Oh!

2762
02:13:13,280 --> 02:13:13,800
Oh!

2763
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:14,760
Oh!

2764
02:13:17,020 --> 02:13:18,060
April 30th!

2765
02:13:25,950 --> 02:13:27,430
Is that a bad guy?

2766
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:33,780
Like he's got his fist up ready?

2767
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:35,760
Ready for fighting?

2768
02:13:42,380 --> 02:13:42,900
Okay.

2769
02:13:43,540 --> 02:13:44,280
Oh no!

2770
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:45,420
What's wrong with you?

2771
02:13:54,760 --> 02:13:56,440
I like how he says thank you.

2772
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:57,040
They're so polite.

2773
02:13:57,220 --> 02:13:57,920
They're so cute.

2774
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:00,020
You think there's a guy in there?

2775
02:14:06,280 --> 02:14:07,920
I gotta watch out for the...

2776
02:14:08,780 --> 02:14:09,520
The ghoul.

2777
02:14:15,380 --> 02:14:16,820
We are killing it, you guys.

2778
02:14:16,900 --> 02:14:18,740
We're killing it and we're also killing things.

2779
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:21,820
Oh!

2780
02:14:21,820 --> 02:14:22,220
Oh!

2781
02:14:22,480 --> 02:14:24,020
I don't know what I'm creating.

2782
02:14:24,240 --> 02:14:24,700
Oh, whoa, whoa.

2783
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:26,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2784
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:27,360
What?

2785
02:14:31,350 --> 02:14:32,790
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2786
02:14:34,210 --> 02:14:34,590
Okay.

2787
02:14:34,870 --> 02:14:35,970
There was just that guy.

2788
02:14:36,370 --> 02:14:37,590
Oh, the buildings are pink.

2789
02:14:37,710 --> 02:14:38,510
They're so cute.

2790
02:14:42,470 --> 02:14:44,250
Killing all the birds with stone.

2791
02:14:44,610 --> 02:14:45,370
Yeah, exactly.

2792
02:14:49,790 --> 02:14:50,170
Okay.

2793
02:14:52,870 --> 02:14:54,830
He's like, whoa, calm down, buddy.

2794
02:14:55,230 --> 02:14:56,070
What are you gonna do?

2795
02:14:56,070 --> 02:14:56,270
Whoa!

2796
02:14:56,690 --> 02:14:57,370
Oh my god!

2797
02:14:57,550 --> 02:14:58,950
They're like, we just built this.

2798
02:14:58,990 --> 02:14:59,970
What's wrong with you?

2799
02:15:02,610 --> 02:15:03,670
How do I get over there?

2800
02:15:04,470 --> 02:15:05,070
Just jump?

2801
02:15:07,150 --> 02:15:07,730
Thank you.

2802
02:15:07,810 --> 02:15:08,210
Thank you.

2803
02:15:08,210 --> 02:15:08,450
Thank you.

2804
02:15:13,150 --> 02:15:13,950
Our power.

2805
02:15:14,050 --> 02:15:14,450
Our power.

2806
02:15:14,510 --> 02:15:14,930
Our power.

2807
02:15:15,550 --> 02:15:16,250
What do we get?

2808
02:15:16,310 --> 02:15:16,650
What do we get?

2809
02:15:17,470 --> 02:15:18,130
A dog!

2810
02:15:19,670 --> 02:15:20,510
What does he do?

2811
02:15:23,830 --> 02:15:24,230
Cute.

2812
02:15:25,550 --> 02:15:25,950
Oh!

2813
02:15:26,150 --> 02:15:26,970
Oh my god!

2814
02:15:28,430 --> 02:15:29,050
Distraction!

2815
02:15:37,030 --> 02:15:37,650
Splatoon!

2816
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:49,280
Oh my god, so cute.

2817
02:15:52,940 --> 02:15:56,060
I'm just gonna walk by this guy's real cat.

2818
02:15:56,300 --> 02:15:56,500
Ew!

2819
02:15:58,340 --> 02:15:59,460
Oh my gosh.

2820
02:16:04,210 --> 02:16:07,150
I wanna make some... I wanna get something into the...

2821
02:16:07,150 --> 02:16:08,610
Maybe if I...

2822
02:16:10,830 --> 02:16:11,150
Oh!

2823
02:16:11,990 --> 02:16:12,310
Oh!

2824
02:16:14,670 --> 02:16:15,330
Oh, dang it!

2825
02:16:15,470 --> 02:16:17,350
If I had punched him...

2826
02:16:19,150 --> 02:16:19,790
Into the...

2827
02:16:19,790 --> 02:16:20,570
Okay, hold on.

2828
02:16:20,610 --> 02:16:21,030
Come over here.

2829
02:16:23,090 --> 02:16:24,090
They're doing graffiti!

2830
02:16:25,930 --> 02:16:26,570
Come here, come here.

2831
02:16:27,010 --> 02:16:28,010
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

2832
02:16:28,950 --> 02:16:29,270
Wait!

2833
02:16:33,470 --> 02:16:34,850
I wanna get through the hoop!

2834
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:53,040
Oh my gosh, wait.

2835
02:16:53,360 --> 02:16:54,260
We actually have it.

2836
02:16:54,300 --> 02:16:54,940
We actually have it.

2837
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:55,380
Okay, hold on.

2838
02:16:55,420 --> 02:16:56,080
This is a good line-up.

2839
02:16:56,140 --> 02:16:56,760
This is a good line-up.

2840
02:16:57,740 --> 02:17:03,820
It's a

2841
02:17:17,180 --> 02:17:17,180
good line-up.

2842
02:17:17,180 --> 02:17:17,340
Oh my god!

2843
02:17:17,340 --> 02:17:18,460
Why didn't it work?!

2844
02:17:32,750 --> 02:17:33,570
Jammer Sammy!

2845
02:17:36,470 --> 02:17:37,070
How

2846
02:17:55,240 --> 02:17:56,660
do we get that one?

2847
02:17:57,700 --> 02:17:59,640
I like the music in this area too.

2848
02:18:02,580 --> 02:18:04,240
Can I push this?

2849
02:18:04,460 --> 02:18:04,780
No.

2850
02:18:05,820 --> 02:18:06,820
Only destroyed.

2851
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:09,720
Wait!

2852
02:18:09,960 --> 02:18:11,060
Can I push this?

2853
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:12,720
Okay, okay, okay.

2854
02:18:12,720 --> 02:18:12,860
Oh!

2855
02:18:12,940 --> 02:18:14,500
Only destroy.

2856
02:18:19,060 --> 02:18:21,380
What's here?

2857
02:18:25,080 --> 02:18:27,240
Oh, let's grab cans.

2858
02:18:36,820 --> 02:18:40,380
Can I reach that?

2859
02:18:42,560 --> 02:18:43,800
Wait, can I reach that?

2860
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:45,700
Wait, can I reach that?

2861
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:49,420
Oh, jump dash?

2862
02:18:50,780 --> 02:18:51,560
With the dash?

2863
02:18:51,560 --> 02:18:52,080
With the dog?

2864
02:18:53,780 --> 02:18:54,140
Nice!

2865
02:19:06,730 --> 02:19:07,570
Good job, everybody.

2866
02:19:08,970 --> 02:19:09,750
Good job, team.

2867
02:19:09,890 --> 02:19:10,470
Good job, team.

2868
02:19:11,210 --> 02:19:12,730
How am I supposed to get those up there?

2869
02:19:13,170 --> 02:19:13,530
How?

2870
02:19:13,570 --> 02:19:14,810
Oh my gosh, there's so much up there!

2871
02:19:15,190 --> 02:19:15,810
There's a guy!

2872
02:19:17,330 --> 02:19:17,850
Uh-oh.

2873
02:19:17,970 --> 02:19:18,650
Okay, hold on.

2874
02:19:22,110 --> 02:19:23,310
Did I mess up?

2875
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:34,360
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2876
02:19:34,800 --> 02:19:35,360
Okay, okay.

2877
02:19:36,760 --> 02:19:37,580
Okay, okay, okay.

2878
02:19:38,660 --> 02:19:40,440
I see you, I see you, I see you!

2879
02:19:40,800 --> 02:19:41,340
I'm coming!

2880
02:19:51,390 --> 02:19:52,230
Oh, that was close.

2881
02:19:53,310 --> 02:19:54,550
That was close, that was close.

2882
02:19:55,190 --> 02:19:56,670
Oh gosh, this one's going to be tricky.

2883
02:19:58,110 --> 02:19:58,470
Weep!

2884
02:19:58,830 --> 02:20:02,170
I might...

2885
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:09,220
be a gamer.

2886
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:11,280
I might be a gamer.

2887
02:20:12,380 --> 02:20:14,760
I might be the gamer who ever lived.

2888
02:20:15,880 --> 02:20:16,480
Actually...

2889
02:20:16,480 --> 02:20:17,660
I'm not even alive.

2890
02:20:21,580 --> 02:20:22,940
I might be...

2891
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:25,100
the gamer who ever died.

2892
02:20:30,460 --> 02:20:31,060
Why?

2893
02:20:32,220 --> 02:20:32,820
Oh,

2894
02:20:42,570 --> 02:20:44,550
was I supposed to make it through the hole, or...

2895
02:20:48,890 --> 02:20:50,090
I know.

2896
02:20:50,350 --> 02:20:51,490
I know.

2897
02:20:59,630 --> 02:21:01,050
Should I do it again?

2898
02:21:03,350 --> 02:21:03,870
It's down.

2899
02:21:03,870 --> 02:21:03,950
Should I try again?

2900
02:21:03,950 --> 02:21:04,550
Should I try again?

2901
02:21:04,810 --> 02:21:05,330
Or...

2902
02:21:06,310 --> 02:21:06,830
No.

2903
02:21:09,210 --> 02:21:09,730
It's down.

2904
02:21:11,670 --> 02:21:12,990
It's going to lift back up.

2905
02:21:27,290 --> 02:21:28,830
Well, at least we destroyed him.

2906
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:41,280
The absolute gamer that ever games.

2907
02:21:41,620 --> 02:21:42,540
It shows you can leap back!

2908
02:21:44,140 --> 02:21:45,300
That's what I said?

2909
02:21:51,950 --> 02:21:52,970
Here's our chance!

2910
02:21:54,230 --> 02:21:54,910
Redo!

2911
02:22:00,030 --> 02:22:01,390
3-0 right now.

2912
02:22:03,930 --> 02:22:05,590
I don't think I made it again.

2913
02:22:07,270 --> 02:22:08,710
There we go!

2914
02:22:09,150 --> 02:22:10,690
I made it through the hole!

2915
02:22:14,110 --> 02:22:15,950
But nothing happened.

2916
02:22:33,820 --> 02:22:34,680
Oh my god.

2917
02:22:49,140 --> 02:22:50,160
Like a ball pit.

2918
02:22:50,340 --> 02:22:51,100
Yeah, pretty much.

2919
02:23:01,250 --> 02:23:02,310
Got him, baby!

2920
02:23:02,490 --> 02:23:03,010
Got him!

2921
02:23:03,650 --> 02:23:05,470
What about the guy that stole our friend?

2922
02:23:05,670 --> 02:23:06,430
Is he still alive?

2923
02:23:07,430 --> 02:23:08,570
Is there anything in here?

2924
02:23:10,230 --> 02:23:12,090
Guys, there's probably a secret in here.

2925
02:23:14,330 --> 02:23:16,190
Sorry, dog.

2926
02:23:16,190 --> 02:23:18,630
This side definitely is a secret.

2927
02:23:19,510 --> 02:23:20,270
Never mind.

2928
02:23:22,110 --> 02:23:23,710
There's gotta be something in here.

2929
02:23:26,010 --> 02:23:28,030
There's gotta be a secret in here.

2930
02:23:33,370 --> 02:23:34,230
Just a box.

2931
02:23:34,890 --> 02:23:38,210
This time, Minto, it's just a box.

2932
02:23:55,640 --> 02:23:58,660
Why does this platform exist if there's nothing here?

2933
02:24:05,690 --> 02:24:07,750
I got... something.

2934
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:24,640
Do you guys know that one indie animation thing that went viral?

2935
02:24:24,880 --> 02:24:28,700
It was so well animated, but it was a bunch of beans.

2936
02:24:30,440 --> 02:24:32,500
That's exactly what this guy looks like.

2937
02:24:34,620 --> 02:24:35,740
Like the killer bean!

2938
02:24:36,020 --> 02:24:37,320
Yeah, it's a bunch of beans.

2939
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:39,460
That's exactly what this guy looks like.

2940
02:24:42,180 --> 02:24:43,380
Looks like the killer bean.

2941
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:48,580
Oh my gosh, I'm destroying the platform?

2942
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:49,820
That's crazy.

2943
02:24:53,380 --> 02:24:54,180
Where are you going?

2944
02:24:54,300 --> 02:24:54,580
Where are you going?

2945
02:25:03,850 --> 02:25:05,210
Okay, alright.

2946
02:25:05,870 --> 02:25:07,370
We got this guy.

2947
02:25:08,290 --> 02:25:09,870
We got this...

2948
02:25:10,650 --> 02:25:11,650
We've got...

2949
02:25:15,920 --> 02:25:17,020
We've got this.

2950
02:25:17,060 --> 02:25:18,840
Who do you think is gonna be our little...

2951
02:25:20,580 --> 02:25:21,100
Yeah!

2952
02:25:22,040 --> 02:25:23,700
Who do you think is gonna be...

2953
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:33,960
Our thing... our...

2954
02:25:49,400 --> 02:25:50,960
Who the hell is that?

2955
02:25:56,040 --> 02:25:56,660
What's this?

2956
02:25:57,360 --> 02:25:58,520
There's so much everywhere.

2957
02:25:58,800 --> 02:25:59,860
A photo spot!

2958
02:26:00,500 --> 02:26:03,720
Ew, they keep pooping!

2959
02:26:03,720 --> 02:26:04,720
Ew, gross!

2960
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:07,100
Ew, they're eating their own poo!

2961
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:09,360
This is so nasty!

2962
02:26:10,240 --> 02:26:11,920
Oh my god, save us!

2963
02:26:12,180 --> 02:26:13,580
Why are there so many birds?

2964
02:26:14,020 --> 02:26:14,740
Oh, please.

2965
02:26:15,380 --> 02:26:16,940
Get me out of this hell!

2966
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:22,230
I think that was it.

2967
02:26:23,670 --> 02:26:24,270
Wait.

2968
02:26:24,610 --> 02:26:25,870
But I can go...

2969
02:26:25,870 --> 02:26:27,510
I should go down.

2970
02:26:31,470 --> 02:26:33,410
We should go down.

2971
02:26:33,610 --> 02:26:34,110
This way.

2972
02:26:34,930 --> 02:26:35,750
This way!

2973
02:26:35,810 --> 02:26:36,130
This way!

2974
02:26:36,130 --> 02:26:36,350
This way.

2975
02:26:36,350 --> 02:26:37,030
This way.

2976
02:26:37,210 --> 02:26:37,450
This way.

2977
02:26:37,530 --> 02:26:37,630
This way.

2978
02:26:37,630 --> 02:26:37,710
This way.

2979
02:26:39,970 --> 02:26:40,450
Okay.

2980
02:26:46,450 --> 02:26:48,310
Poopies don't feel very stable.

2981
02:26:50,010 --> 02:26:50,490
Okay.

2982
02:26:53,030 --> 02:26:54,330
Oh my gosh!

2983
02:27:00,030 --> 02:27:00,730
Where's this guy?

2984
02:27:01,870 --> 02:27:02,350
Come

2985
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:08,160
on!

2986
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:08,640
Come...

2987
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:08,860
Oh!

2988
02:27:09,300 --> 02:27:10,040
Come on!

2989
02:27:10,440 --> 02:27:11,680
Oh, I have to find the platforms!

2990
02:27:12,020 --> 02:27:12,820
Oh my gosh!

2991
02:27:13,340 --> 02:27:13,820
Oh!

2992
02:27:13,880 --> 02:27:14,360
Wow!

2993
02:27:15,720 --> 02:27:16,200
Wow!

2994
02:27:16,240 --> 02:27:16,720
Wow!

2995
02:27:16,900 --> 02:27:16,980
Wow!

2996
02:27:16,980 --> 02:27:17,320
Wow!

2997
02:27:17,320 --> 02:27:17,720
Wow!

2998
02:27:17,720 --> 02:27:18,080
Wow!

2999
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:18,320
Wow!

3000
02:27:18,320 --> 02:27:18,360
Wow!

3001
02:27:18,360 --> 02:27:18,420
Wow!

3002
02:27:20,040 --> 02:27:21,500
Am I shooting the right way?

3003
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:24,180
Okay.

3004
02:27:25,320 --> 02:27:26,480
I think we're good.

3005
02:27:28,140 --> 02:27:28,960
Oh god.

3006
02:27:38,840 --> 02:27:40,660
Love-struck lyricist!

3007
02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:43,180
A cool pooch with the power of self-belief!

3008
02:27:43,640 --> 02:27:44,300
Palapa!

3009
02:27:46,740 --> 02:27:47,840
He's so cute!

3010
02:27:49,340 --> 02:27:50,000
Awesome.

3011
02:27:51,460 --> 02:27:52,120
Wait.

3012
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:52,680
So...

3013
02:27:52,680 --> 02:27:53,200
Okay, cool.

3014
02:27:53,880 --> 02:27:54,540
Okay.

3015
02:27:54,700 --> 02:27:57,560
Let's go this way!

3016
02:27:59,220 --> 02:27:59,760
Alright.

3017
02:28:00,120 --> 02:28:00,660
Onwards.

3018
02:28:08,940 --> 02:28:10,420
I have not played Palapa.

3019
02:28:13,100 --> 02:28:14,000
I have not!

3020
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:14,700
I have not!

3021
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:17,060
How

3022
02:28:24,760 --> 02:28:26,360
am I supposed to take care of this guy?

3023
02:28:32,710 --> 02:28:33,490
You should.

3024
02:28:35,190 --> 02:28:35,730
Oh!

3025
02:28:35,790 --> 02:28:36,090
Oh!

3026
02:28:36,090 --> 02:28:36,770
That was close!

3027
02:28:37,050 --> 02:28:37,570
Oh!

3028
02:28:37,750 --> 02:28:38,290
Hi!

3029
02:28:39,130 --> 02:28:39,550
Hi!

3030
02:28:39,750 --> 02:28:40,150
Hi!

3031
02:28:40,150 --> 02:28:40,170
Hi!

3032
02:28:40,310 --> 02:28:40,370
Hi!

3033
02:28:40,370 --> 02:28:40,570
Hi!

3034
02:28:45,360 --> 02:28:45,900
Hi!

3035
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:46,380
And I have to...

3036
02:28:46,380 --> 02:28:46,860
Which way do I go?

3037
02:28:47,740 --> 02:28:48,140
Something

3038
02:29:05,440 --> 02:29:06,080
on my back?

3039
02:29:06,140 --> 02:29:07,500
Or they have something on their backs?

3040
02:29:07,660 --> 02:29:08,400
They look like the...

3041
02:29:08,400 --> 02:29:08,720
Um...

3042
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:09,840
They look like...

3043
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:11,040
Uh...

3044
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:12,000
Death Stranding.

3045
02:29:15,080 --> 02:29:16,840
Hover over him with your lasers!

3046
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:18,580
Oh, my lasers.

3047
02:29:20,220 --> 02:29:20,860
That's right!

3048
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:22,140
That was a way to kill.

3049
02:29:22,700 --> 02:29:23,100
Okay.

3050
02:29:28,490 --> 02:29:28,890
Yeah!

3051
02:29:29,910 --> 02:29:31,030
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3052
02:29:32,890 --> 02:29:33,290
Oh!

3053
02:29:33,370 --> 02:29:33,950
It's gone.

3054
02:29:34,250 --> 02:29:35,630
I hope there was nothing else there.

3055
02:29:36,230 --> 02:29:36,630
Hahaha!

3056
02:29:36,630 --> 02:29:36,970
Oh!

3057
02:29:42,970 --> 02:29:43,930
Sit up!

3058
02:29:44,530 --> 02:29:45,750
Thank you!

3059
02:29:47,490 --> 02:29:47,970
Ready?

3060
02:29:48,110 --> 02:29:48,490
Ready?

3061
02:29:49,250 --> 02:29:49,730
Yeah!

3062
02:29:59,190 --> 02:30:01,110
Alright, we just have the one last one.

3063
02:30:01,290 --> 02:30:02,250
Just the one last one.

3064
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:08,480
Nice.

3065
02:30:19,450 --> 02:30:19,930
Nice.

3066
02:30:21,110 --> 02:30:21,770
Get out

3067
02:30:31,780 --> 02:30:32,000
of here.

3068
02:30:32,180 --> 02:30:34,160
Oh my gosh, you can even punch the water.

3069
02:30:37,660 --> 02:30:39,060
Who is that over there?

3070
02:30:41,260 --> 02:30:42,000
Oh my gosh!

3071
02:30:46,060 --> 02:30:48,980
Wait, who is that?

3072
02:30:55,540 --> 02:30:56,360
Shredding Sheep.

3073
02:30:56,360 --> 02:30:57,800
Oh, why rap when you can shred?

3074
02:30:59,280 --> 02:30:59,820
So cute!

3075
02:31:06,500 --> 02:31:07,760
Oh, she's also from Parappa.

3076
02:31:15,390 --> 02:31:16,050
Wait a second.

3077
02:31:16,210 --> 02:31:17,190
Did I see something below?

3078
02:31:17,490 --> 02:31:18,410
Or am I crazy?

3079
02:31:20,630 --> 02:31:21,650
What's that down there?

3080
02:31:22,390 --> 02:31:22,930
I do!

3081
02:31:22,990 --> 02:31:23,270
I do!

3082
02:31:23,290 --> 02:31:23,550
I do!

3083
02:31:23,590 --> 02:31:24,330
I see something below!

3084
02:31:27,550 --> 02:31:28,610
How can we make it?

3085
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:35,140
Oh, not through here.

3086
02:31:36,360 --> 02:31:38,540
And there's even a jumpy platform here.

3087
02:31:38,860 --> 02:31:39,420
Okay, okay.

3088
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:40,880
We can just fall here, I think.

3089
02:31:45,550 --> 02:31:45,970
Hahaha!

3090
02:31:45,970 --> 02:31:46,130
Aha!

3091
02:31:48,510 --> 02:31:49,490
What is this?

3092
02:31:53,390 --> 02:31:54,290
I'm feeling.

3093
02:31:54,650 --> 02:31:56,370
I'm feeling with my heart.

3094
02:31:58,250 --> 02:31:59,870
I'm feeling with my heart.

3095
02:32:01,510 --> 02:32:02,410
This one.

3096
02:32:04,310 --> 02:32:04,910
Yippee!

3097
02:32:07,250 --> 02:32:07,850
Aha!

3098
02:32:08,890 --> 02:32:10,290
We got all of them!

3099
02:32:10,850 --> 02:32:12,750
I think we're so good at this game.

3100
02:32:14,330 --> 02:32:16,330
Oh, I have to dash through here.

3101
02:32:23,740 --> 02:32:24,180
Nice!

3102
02:32:26,060 --> 02:32:27,100
Why did the music stop?

3103
02:32:29,700 --> 02:32:31,060
What happened to the fun music?

3104
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:33,740
What happened to the fun music?

3105
02:32:34,600 --> 02:32:35,980
What happened to the fun music?

3106
02:32:37,260 --> 02:32:38,260
Oh my god!

3107
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:41,060
I'm gonna get caught!

3108
02:32:42,780 --> 02:32:43,220
Oops.

3109
02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:45,620
Oops.

3110
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:47,080
Hahaha!

3111
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:48,600
Okay.

3112
02:32:48,960 --> 02:32:49,700
I got caught.

3113
02:32:50,600 --> 02:32:51,040
Okay.

3114
02:32:51,380 --> 02:32:52,140
No worries!

3115
02:32:53,480 --> 02:32:53,920
Oh.

3116
02:32:53,960 --> 02:32:54,100
No!

3117
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:55,480
Oh.

3118
02:32:55,620 --> 02:32:56,060
Ow!

3119
02:32:56,300 --> 02:32:56,500
Ow!

3120
02:32:56,720 --> 02:32:57,440
I keep...

3121
02:32:57,920 --> 02:32:59,520
I keep forgetting how to press buttons.

3122
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:01,520
Gamer!

3123
02:33:01,820 --> 02:33:02,360
I'm gaming!

3124
02:33:02,480 --> 02:33:02,840
I'm gaming!

3125
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:03,260
I'm gaming!

3126
02:33:03,300 --> 02:33:03,700
I'm gaming!

3127
02:33:03,740 --> 02:33:04,140
I'm gaming!

3128
02:33:04,180 --> 02:33:04,560
I'm gaming!

3129
02:33:04,600 --> 02:33:05,000
I'm gaming!

3130
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:05,440
I'm gaming!

3131
02:33:05,460 --> 02:33:05,840
I'm gaming!

3132
02:33:05,900 --> 02:33:05,900
I'm gaming!

3133
02:33:05,980 --> 02:33:06,300
I'm gaming!

3134
02:33:06,380 --> 02:33:06,380
I'm gaming!

3135
02:33:06,480 --> 02:33:07,140
I'm gaming!

3136
02:33:12,580 --> 02:33:12,600
Oh.

3137
02:33:12,760 --> 02:33:13,120
Uh.

3138
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:14,120
Uh.

3139
02:33:14,380 --> 02:33:14,820
Oh.

3140
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:16,240
But.

3141
02:33:16,380 --> 02:33:16,660
Ah!

3142
02:33:16,660 --> 02:33:17,420
Gamed

3143
02:33:20,800 --> 02:33:21,800
so much there.

3144
02:33:25,900 --> 02:33:26,900
So cute.

3145
02:33:27,360 --> 02:33:27,860
Go!

3146
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:28,140
Go!

3147
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:28,700
Astra!

3148
02:33:30,380 --> 02:33:30,880
Uh.

3149
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:31,880
We did enough.

3150
02:33:32,220 --> 02:33:32,960
It's fine.

3151
02:33:33,940 --> 02:33:34,440
Oh.

3152
02:33:34,540 --> 02:33:35,040
Uh.

3153
02:33:35,120 --> 02:33:35,680
You gonna come back?

3154
02:33:36,640 --> 02:33:37,140
Nice.

3155
02:33:37,340 --> 02:33:37,640
Oh.

3156
02:33:40,210 --> 02:33:41,330
I have cheese here.

3157
02:33:41,390 --> 02:33:42,250
I've completely forgot.

3158
02:33:42,530 --> 02:33:43,110
Oh my gosh.

3159
02:33:43,110 --> 02:33:44,370
I was eating my cheese and crackers.

3160
02:33:53,590 --> 02:33:54,090
Oh.

3161
02:33:55,970 --> 02:33:58,290
I wanna sacrifice my guys for this?

3162
02:33:58,390 --> 02:33:58,570
Oh.

3163
02:34:19,500 --> 02:34:20,840
There's just one guy in here.

3164
02:34:50,100 --> 02:34:51,260
Ape escape, you think?

3165
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:52,600
You think so?

3166
02:34:53,560 --> 02:34:55,000
You think this is gonna be ape escape?

3167
02:34:55,160 --> 02:34:55,700
That'd be awesome.

3168
02:35:13,860 --> 02:35:14,260
Wait.

3169
02:35:14,680 --> 02:35:15,080
Oh.

3170
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:15,580
What's in here?

3171
02:35:16,180 --> 02:35:16,580
Oh.

3172
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:17,520
Yah!

3173
02:35:21,920 --> 02:35:22,620
What do we get?

3174
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:22,980
What do we get?

3175
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:23,120
Oh!

3176
02:35:23,280 --> 02:35:24,280
We get dog bath.

3177
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:26,540
I should've known from the ape...

3178
02:35:27,160 --> 02:35:28,360
from the monkey right here.

3179
02:35:31,600 --> 02:35:33,440
I hear like some...

3180
02:35:33,440 --> 02:35:34,380
I hear something.

3181
02:35:35,720 --> 02:35:37,560
I hear like a guy like...

3182
02:35:38,300 --> 02:35:39,300
in my ear.

3183
02:35:41,460 --> 02:35:42,420
Do you hear that?

3184
02:35:43,340 --> 02:35:45,520
It sounds like a monkey like in my ear.

3185
02:35:46,900 --> 02:35:47,380
Hmm.

3186
02:35:50,060 --> 02:35:51,020
Is that my dog?

3187
02:35:52,800 --> 02:35:53,600
Oh my gosh.

3188
02:35:53,740 --> 02:35:53,980
Ah!

3189
02:35:54,100 --> 02:35:54,560
Ah!

3190
02:36:01,440 --> 02:36:04,560
It sounded like it was coming from below but maybe it is my dog.

3191
02:36:04,740 --> 02:36:07,100
I just didn't hear it before with the dog.

3192
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:07,200
Oh.

3193
02:36:07,200 --> 02:36:08,280
Maybe because the music was louder.

3194
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:09,880
Oh wait.

3195
02:36:09,960 --> 02:36:10,360
No.

3196
02:36:10,460 --> 02:36:10,840
I'm not ready.

3197
02:36:15,020 --> 02:36:16,280
There's gotta be a secret here.

3198
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:17,460
Nothing?

3199
02:36:18,660 --> 02:36:19,140
Oh!

3200
02:36:19,220 --> 02:36:19,740
Oh no!

3201
02:36:20,120 --> 02:36:20,820
The crazy...

3202
02:36:26,180 --> 02:36:26,660
Sorry.

3203
02:36:56,080 --> 02:36:57,820
I just thought there was a secret.

3204
02:36:59,880 --> 02:37:00,440
That's all.

3205
02:37:07,950 --> 02:37:08,430
Oh.

3206
02:37:08,430 --> 02:37:08,710
Shoot.

3207
02:37:08,850 --> 02:37:09,070
Ah!

3208
02:37:10,090 --> 02:37:10,570
I...

3209
02:37:10,570 --> 02:37:12,130
I've missed the...

3210
02:37:12,130 --> 02:37:12,910
I've missed the...

3211
02:37:12,910 --> 02:37:14,510
Oh my goodness.

3212
02:37:14,690 --> 02:37:15,190
It takes us...

3213
02:37:15,190 --> 02:37:17,110
It takes us back kinda far though.

3214
02:37:17,210 --> 02:37:17,310
Oh.

3215
02:37:20,530 --> 02:37:21,010
Oh.

3216
02:37:21,090 --> 02:37:21,490
Ah!

3217
02:37:29,210 --> 02:37:30,150
See guys?

3218
02:37:32,190 --> 02:37:33,790
Obligatory lurker membu chat.

3219
02:37:33,950 --> 02:37:34,930
Thanks Siege.

3220
02:37:35,590 --> 02:37:37,550
Nathan welcome to membu ship.

3221
02:37:37,970 --> 02:37:38,770
Thank you.

3222
02:37:39,610 --> 02:37:40,890
That's not what I would do to you.

3223
02:37:41,050 --> 02:37:41,810
By the way.

3224
02:37:41,830 --> 02:37:42,210
You know.

3225
02:37:46,360 --> 02:37:46,840
Um.

3226
02:37:48,700 --> 02:37:49,760
So don't worry.

3227
02:37:50,040 --> 02:37:50,380
Oh.

3228
02:37:51,140 --> 02:37:52,000
Unless you want.

3229
02:37:52,160 --> 02:37:53,040
Unless you're just like damn.

3230
02:37:53,820 --> 02:37:55,420
I wish she'd beat me to a pulp.

3231
02:37:55,480 --> 02:37:55,900
Oh.

3232
02:37:55,900 --> 02:38:00,220
I wish she'd beat me until I turn into little scrap pieces.

3233
02:38:03,800 --> 02:38:04,320
Oh.

3234
02:38:04,340 --> 02:38:04,480
Whoa.

3235
02:38:04,580 --> 02:38:05,260
That was close.

3236
02:38:12,060 --> 02:38:13,260
Why are you guys blushing?

3237
02:38:22,150 --> 02:38:22,670
Whoa.

3238
02:38:22,930 --> 02:38:23,210
Ah!

3239
02:38:23,350 --> 02:38:23,790
Oh.

3240
02:38:23,850 --> 02:38:24,290
Whoops.

3241
02:38:24,450 --> 02:38:24,710
Um.

3242
02:38:24,790 --> 02:38:24,970
Ah!

3243
02:38:27,090 --> 02:38:27,590
Oh.

3244
02:38:29,370 --> 02:38:30,570
We're about to go banana.

3245
02:38:32,110 --> 02:38:32,630
Oh.

3246
02:38:33,930 --> 02:38:34,770
What does that say?

3247
02:38:34,870 --> 02:38:35,390
Go...

3248
02:38:37,550 --> 02:38:38,070
Ghost.

3249
02:38:38,230 --> 02:38:38,630
Ghost.

3250
02:38:41,210 --> 02:38:42,050
Suck a banana?

3251
02:38:42,290 --> 02:38:42,830
Like there's a...

3252
02:38:42,830 --> 02:38:43,690
What's this?

3253
02:38:43,830 --> 02:38:44,310
It says...

3254
02:38:44,310 --> 02:38:44,970
Go sui.

3255
02:38:45,190 --> 02:38:45,690
Go...

3256
02:38:47,050 --> 02:38:47,550
Sssssss...

3257
02:38:51,530 --> 02:38:52,190
Oh wait.

3258
02:38:52,230 --> 02:38:52,470
It's a C.

3259
02:38:53,450 --> 02:38:53,950
Ko...

3260
02:38:53,950 --> 02:38:54,830
Ko...

3261
02:38:56,950 --> 02:38:57,450
Sui...

3262
02:39:03,460 --> 02:39:03,960
S...

3263
02:39:03,960 --> 02:39:04,440
Sauce?

3264
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:08,960
Go sui sssss...

3265
02:39:11,100 --> 02:39:14,550
Hey I'm not there yet.

3266
02:39:14,750 --> 02:39:15,130
Chill out.

3267
02:39:16,850 --> 02:39:17,530
I guess I'm just saying I don't want to die.

3268
02:39:17,550 --> 02:39:18,730
I guess there's not very many secrets here, huh?

3269
02:39:19,830 --> 02:39:20,870
Oh, Cosmic!

3270
02:39:21,210 --> 02:39:22,070
Where's the M?

3271
02:39:25,130 --> 02:39:26,570
Is the U an M?

3272
02:39:33,560 --> 02:39:34,080
No.

3273
02:39:37,280 --> 02:39:38,540
I don't see it.

3274
02:39:39,200 --> 02:39:41,060
And in fact, I refuse to.

3275
02:39:42,060 --> 02:39:42,840
Here we go!

3276
02:39:45,240 --> 02:39:45,760
Gorilla!

3277
02:39:45,980 --> 02:39:46,380
Ah!

3278
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:47,820
Mighty Chewie!

3279
02:40:00,620 --> 02:40:01,060
Sweet!

3280
02:40:18,010 --> 02:40:18,790
We're almost there!

3281
02:40:21,640 --> 02:40:22,900
Oh, we got some stuff.

3282
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:23,840
I don't know what that is though.

3283
02:40:24,900 --> 02:40:25,340
Ew!

3284
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:26,300
What are you...

3285
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:27,560
Gross!

3286
02:40:27,720 --> 02:40:29,220
Why are you eating your monkeys?

3287
02:40:30,680 --> 02:40:31,120
Go!

3288
02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:31,560
Sweet!

3289
02:40:41,360 --> 02:40:43,060
Are you gonna... Are you done?

3290
02:40:43,840 --> 02:40:44,260
Take

3291
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:51,520
his eye!

3292
02:40:51,780 --> 02:40:52,720
Oh my god!

3293
02:40:52,900 --> 02:40:53,700
Oh my god!

3294
02:40:54,340 --> 02:40:55,320
Holy cow!

3295
02:40:57,880 --> 02:41:00,220
He's gonna become Big Boss Monkey!

3296
02:41:11,400 --> 02:41:13,120
That's why they trained us for the hole!

3297
02:41:14,300 --> 02:41:14,900
Oh!

3298
02:41:15,360 --> 02:41:15,960
Nasty!

3299
02:41:16,120 --> 02:41:16,740
Oh gosh!

3300
02:41:17,360 --> 02:41:18,340
Oh my god!

3301
02:41:18,340 --> 02:41:18,460
Oh!

3302
02:41:38,180 --> 02:41:38,740
Yeah!

3303
02:41:38,740 --> 02:41:40,140
You can't see anything!

3304
02:41:52,690 --> 02:41:53,890
You're stressing me out!

3305
02:41:53,990 --> 02:41:55,150
Why are you chomping?

3306
02:41:56,590 --> 02:41:57,530
Oh my god!

3307
02:41:58,290 --> 02:41:59,450
Beat up his teeth!

3308
02:42:00,210 --> 02:42:02,150
He has no teeth now!

3309
02:42:04,090 --> 02:42:05,690
Where are you gonna hide your monkeys?

3310
02:42:06,210 --> 02:42:07,430
How are you chewing?

3311
02:42:08,130 --> 02:42:09,490
Here, think of...

3312
02:42:09,490 --> 02:42:10,130
Oh my God!

3313
02:42:10,630 --> 02:42:11,850
Think of your dentist!

3314
02:42:12,410 --> 02:42:12,990
Please!

3315
02:42:16,850 --> 02:42:18,470
Oh, here we go, here we go.

3316
02:42:19,230 --> 02:42:19,810
Huh!

3317
02:42:20,110 --> 02:42:20,690
Ew!

3318
02:42:21,150 --> 02:42:21,730
Ew!

3319
02:42:27,900 --> 02:42:28,480
Easy!

3320
02:42:38,410 --> 02:42:39,710
Bleah, bleh, bleh.

3321
02:42:40,450 --> 02:42:41,910
Bleah, bleh, bleh, bleh.

3322
02:42:46,830 --> 02:42:48,930
Who's in there?� в с mà!

3323
02:42:48,930 --> 02:42:49,390

02:43:07,720 --> 02:43:08,620
Here we go!

3326
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:09,660
Here we go!

3327
02:43:09,720 --> 02:43:10,300
Here we go!

3328
02:43:10,320 --> 02:43:10,820
Here we go!

3329
02:43:10,880 --> 02:43:11,080
Here we

3330
02:43:18,300 --> 02:43:18,520
go!

3331
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:20,120
Yeah!

3332
02:43:23,790 --> 02:43:24,590
Bye, monkey!

3333
02:43:27,250 --> 02:43:28,130
Monkey University!

3334
02:43:29,030 --> 02:43:29,910
Oh my gosh!

3335
02:43:31,230 --> 02:43:32,110
Wait, what is this?

3336
02:43:33,570 --> 02:43:34,930
Is this a new world?

3337
02:43:36,730 --> 02:43:37,290
Ape-san!

3338
02:43:37,410 --> 02:43:38,510
Holy cow!

3339
02:43:39,550 --> 02:43:41,690
Oh wait, I think that's the Statue of Liberty.

3340
02:43:41,690 --> 02:43:44,530
I thought it was a graduation gown.

3341
02:43:46,930 --> 02:43:48,470
Wait, let's go back home real quick.

3342
02:43:48,950 --> 02:43:49,790
Excuse me.

3343
02:43:49,830 --> 02:43:50,390
Excuse me.

3344
02:43:50,510 --> 02:43:50,930
Wait!

3345
02:43:51,110 --> 02:43:52,330
Wait, let's catch this guy.

3346
02:43:56,330 --> 02:43:57,170
Dang it!

3347
02:43:57,310 --> 02:43:58,010
Where did he go?

3348
02:44:04,590 --> 02:44:05,010
Crumble...

3349
02:44:05,910 --> 02:44:06,330
Rumble...

3350
02:44:07,050 --> 02:44:07,470
Interesting.

3351
02:44:12,780 --> 02:44:13,760
She said the word.

3352
02:44:13,820 --> 02:44:14,180
What word?

3353
02:44:16,620 --> 02:44:18,160
Oh, I missed the puzzle piece.

3354
02:44:24,400 --> 02:44:25,780
We got another one.

3355
02:44:25,940 --> 02:44:26,300
What

3356
02:44:30,260 --> 02:44:31,560
is this?

3357
02:44:31,660 --> 02:44:31,800
Oh!

3358
02:44:32,480 --> 02:44:33,200
Holy cow.

3359
02:44:34,460 --> 02:44:35,420
Retro Rampage!

3360
02:44:35,960 --> 02:44:36,880
And then...

3361
02:44:37,740 --> 02:44:38,560
Rolling Star.

3362
02:44:38,640 --> 02:44:39,480
Rolling Star?

3363
02:44:39,580 --> 02:44:40,940
Wait, you think Katamari is here?

3364
02:44:41,220 --> 02:44:41,740
Must be.

3365
02:44:41,980 --> 02:44:43,240
We'll go to that one next.

3366
02:44:43,480 --> 02:44:44,880
After I go back to home planet.

3367
02:44:59,160 --> 02:44:59,920
Hello, everybody.

3368
02:45:00,100 --> 02:45:00,960
I have returned.

3369
02:45:02,700 --> 02:45:04,240
I have returned.

3370
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:05,600
Snake!

3371
02:45:05,720 --> 02:45:06,620
Did you miss me?

3372
02:45:17,790 --> 02:45:18,990
What is this?

3373
02:45:21,570 --> 02:45:22,510
Good or nice?

3374
02:45:22,510 --> 02:45:22,830
Good or nice?

3375
02:45:22,990 --> 02:45:23,370
Oh!

3376
02:45:23,690 --> 02:45:24,690
License to spend.

3377
02:45:24,810 --> 02:45:25,290
The gum.

3378
02:45:25,590 --> 02:45:26,330
The gacha.

3379
02:45:26,470 --> 02:45:29,110
Wow, they spell gacha with a T like I used to.

3380
02:45:30,950 --> 02:45:33,110
Only old-timers spell it with a T.

3381
02:45:33,710 --> 02:45:35,490
Time to spend all those coins you've collected.

3382
02:45:38,390 --> 02:45:39,490
What are we building now?

3383
02:45:42,210 --> 02:45:43,210
Let's go gambling!

3384
02:45:45,730 --> 02:45:46,970
Wait, what is it building now?

3385
02:45:47,950 --> 02:45:48,490
This one?

3386
02:45:48,630 --> 02:45:49,270
Is this the closet?

3387
02:45:49,770 --> 02:45:51,410
Oh, dual speeder garage.

3388
02:45:51,570 --> 02:45:52,470
When do I get the closet?

3389
02:45:53,310 --> 02:45:54,430
I want to become Snake!

3390
02:45:54,430 --> 02:45:54,550
Snake!

3391
02:46:05,630 --> 02:46:06,450
Hi there!

3392
02:46:13,050 --> 02:46:15,190
It fills me with such joy.

3393
02:46:17,250 --> 02:46:21,080
Oh, gacha, gacha!

3394
02:46:21,180 --> 02:46:22,260
Wait, I have a question.

3395
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:24,000
I have a question.

3396
02:46:24,140 --> 02:46:25,880
Are the coins used for anything else?

3397
02:46:28,080 --> 02:46:30,660
Are the coins used for anything else or just gacha?

3398
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:32,400
Because I...

3399
02:46:34,240 --> 02:46:34,640
It

3400
02:46:38,890 --> 02:46:39,930
was my birthday yesterday.

3401
02:46:40,070 --> 02:46:41,190
Any chance I can get a happy birthday?

3402
02:46:41,270 --> 02:46:41,630
Of course!

3403
02:46:42,030 --> 02:46:42,810
So that's what I want to say.

3404
02:46:42,870 --> 02:46:44,770
But I really want to thank you for just being you.

3405
02:46:44,930 --> 02:46:46,910
I hope you can get a happy birthday from me next year too.

3406
02:46:47,070 --> 02:46:48,270
Of course you can!

3407
02:46:51,790 --> 02:46:54,210
Happy birthday to you.

3408
02:46:55,710 --> 02:46:57,850
Happy birthday to you.

3409
02:46:59,130 --> 02:47:01,850
Happy birthday dear Margot Rose.

3410
02:47:04,370 --> 02:47:07,010
Happy birthday to you.

3411
02:47:10,730 --> 02:47:11,850
Happy birthday!

3412
02:47:12,810 --> 02:47:14,010
This one's for you!

3413
02:47:16,750 --> 02:47:17,310
Gacha?

3414
02:47:17,490 --> 02:47:17,910
How do I?

3415
02:47:18,030 --> 02:47:18,530
A pool!

3416
02:47:20,830 --> 02:47:22,230
What did I get?

3417
02:47:23,650 --> 02:47:25,210
A crate whacker!

3418
02:47:25,350 --> 02:47:25,570
Oh!

3419
02:47:25,970 --> 02:47:27,370
As good as any wrench.

3420
02:47:29,090 --> 02:47:29,650
Cute.

3421
02:47:30,470 --> 02:47:31,430
What does that mean?

3422
02:47:31,550 --> 02:47:31,830
Oh!

3423
02:47:34,540 --> 02:47:35,820
I got a soda!

3424
02:47:36,180 --> 02:47:36,520
I got a soda!

3425
02:47:36,520 --> 02:47:36,840
Crash it!

3426
02:47:37,220 --> 02:47:37,900
Oh!

3427
02:47:38,280 --> 02:47:38,620
What?

3428
02:47:43,740 --> 02:47:44,980
Sunny's sixth string!

3429
02:47:45,340 --> 02:47:47,680
This guitar is not in your mind.

3430
02:47:53,560 --> 02:47:55,380
How much does it cost?

3431
02:48:09,990 --> 02:48:11,050
Cunning disguise.

3432
02:48:11,530 --> 02:48:13,650
Will fool any enemy guard.

3433
02:48:13,950 --> 02:48:14,510
Look at him!

3434
02:48:14,510 --> 02:48:15,010
He's even...

3435
02:48:18,050 --> 02:48:18,890
Solid state.

3436
02:48:20,010 --> 02:48:21,110
Let me see...

3437
02:48:21,110 --> 02:48:22,070
Let me peek in there.

3438
02:48:23,770 --> 02:48:24,730
Let's keep going!

3439
02:48:26,790 --> 02:48:27,110
Crash?

3440
02:48:28,030 --> 02:48:28,670
Birds!

3441
02:48:29,310 --> 02:48:29,950
Squawky.

3442
02:48:34,210 --> 02:48:34,850
Oh!

3443
02:48:34,890 --> 02:48:35,530
Oh!

3444
02:48:35,690 --> 02:48:36,150
It's the...

3445
02:48:36,150 --> 02:48:37,270
That guy from...

3446
02:48:37,270 --> 02:48:37,770
Yeah!

3447
02:48:37,830 --> 02:48:38,170
Crash!

3448
02:48:38,890 --> 02:48:39,870
Protective spirit.

3449
02:48:40,110 --> 02:48:41,190
Makes you feel invincible.

3450
02:48:42,210 --> 02:48:43,190
I'll be honest.

3451
02:48:43,290 --> 02:48:45,230
I never played actual Crash Bandicoot.

3452
02:48:45,350 --> 02:48:46,450
But I played...

3453
02:48:46,450 --> 02:48:46,790
Um...

3454
02:48:47,950 --> 02:48:48,590
So...

3455
02:48:48,590 --> 02:48:48,910
The...

3456
02:48:48,910 --> 02:48:49,390
I had...

3457
02:48:49,390 --> 02:48:50,730
I own the racing one.

3458
02:48:50,990 --> 02:48:51,370
You know?

3459
02:48:55,360 --> 02:48:55,980
Oh!

3460
02:48:57,280 --> 02:48:58,500
A cleaver!

3461
02:48:58,820 --> 02:49:01,280
A cleaver piece of weaponry.

3462
02:49:01,360 --> 02:49:02,580
Hunting essentials.

3463
02:49:03,560 --> 02:49:04,180
Yeah!

3464
02:49:07,480 --> 02:49:08,740
Crash team racing!

3465
02:49:09,080 --> 02:49:09,220
Yeah!

3466
02:49:09,260 --> 02:49:09,440
Yeah!

3467
02:49:09,440 --> 02:49:09,640
Yeah!

3468
02:49:09,880 --> 02:49:10,500
Cute!

3469
02:49:10,900 --> 02:49:11,680
Pop-up pal.

3470
02:49:12,140 --> 02:49:12,600
Cute!

3471
02:49:17,360 --> 02:49:17,980
Oh!

3472
02:49:18,040 --> 02:49:18,280
Oh!

3473
02:49:18,540 --> 02:49:18,620
Oh!

3474
02:49:18,680 --> 02:49:18,920
Oh!

3475
02:49:18,980 --> 02:49:19,360
Oh!

3476
02:49:19,640 --> 02:49:20,260
Oh!

3477
02:49:20,280 --> 02:49:20,940
Alucard's...

3478
02:49:20,940 --> 02:49:22,140
What is going on there?

3479
02:49:22,240 --> 02:49:22,380
Oh!

3480
02:49:22,400 --> 02:49:23,220
It's his alarm clock.

3481
02:49:24,340 --> 02:49:25,900
Somewhere to rest in peace.

3482
02:49:26,480 --> 02:49:28,140
Bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing!

3483
02:49:28,200 --> 02:49:29,420
Kan kan kan kan kan kan kan!

3484
02:49:29,840 --> 02:49:30,460
I'm awake!

3485
02:49:30,620 --> 02:49:30,880
I'm awake!

3486
02:49:30,900 --> 02:49:31,200
I'm awake!

3487
02:49:42,520 --> 02:49:43,040
Oh!

3488
02:49:43,960 --> 02:49:44,480
Cute!

3489
02:49:45,380 --> 02:49:46,640
Oh my god!

3490
02:49:46,700 --> 02:49:47,160
Stop!

3491
02:49:47,960 --> 02:49:48,920
So cute!

3492
02:49:49,040 --> 02:49:49,620
I love...

3493
02:49:49,620 --> 02:49:50,240
Um...

3494
02:49:50,240 --> 02:49:51,260
Parappa's design.

3495
02:49:51,420 --> 02:49:51,820
So cute!

3496
02:49:54,400 --> 02:49:54,920
Next!

3497
02:49:56,700 --> 02:49:57,220
Oh!

3498
02:49:58,820 --> 02:49:59,860
Wisecracking sidekick!

3499
02:50:00,140 --> 02:50:00,380
Ah!

3500
02:50:00,540 --> 02:50:00,740
Ah!

3501
02:50:00,740 --> 02:50:01,900
We got Daxter!

3502
02:50:03,100 --> 02:50:04,720
Has a side hustle as a...

3503
02:50:04,720 --> 02:50:05,640
That is Daxter, right?

3504
02:50:10,460 --> 02:50:12,920
Has a side hustle as a bug exterminator.

3505
02:50:13,800 --> 02:50:14,360
Yep!

3506
02:50:21,940 --> 02:50:23,620
Oh my gosh!

3507
02:50:25,500 --> 02:50:27,100
Hurt me more, snake!

3508
02:50:32,340 --> 02:50:32,900
Next!

3509
02:50:34,080 --> 02:50:35,900
Did we get anything for Psycho Mantis?

3510
02:50:37,100 --> 02:50:37,660
Ah!

3511
02:50:37,800 --> 02:50:37,980
Ah!

3512
02:50:43,860 --> 02:50:44,040
Ah!

3513
02:50:44,060 --> 02:50:45,240
The nostalgia box!

3514
02:50:46,100 --> 02:50:47,820
Did that controller just move?

3515
02:50:50,460 --> 02:50:52,560
Also, look how funny this is.

3516
02:50:53,720 --> 02:50:54,920
The controller...

3517
02:50:54,920 --> 02:50:55,400
Okay...

3518
02:50:55,400 --> 02:50:55,820
I...

3519
02:50:55,820 --> 02:50:56,120
Oh!

3520
02:50:56,220 --> 02:50:56,540
Oh!

3521
02:50:56,540 --> 02:50:57,620
The controller is vibrate...

3522
02:50:57,620 --> 02:50:57,740
Oh!

3523
02:50:57,760 --> 02:50:58,720
The controller is vibrating!

3524
02:50:59,640 --> 02:51:01,240
Vibration is back, baby!

3525
02:51:02,740 --> 02:51:03,340
Um...

3526
02:51:04,220 --> 02:51:04,820
Um...

3527
02:51:04,820 --> 02:51:05,680
Uh...

3528
02:51:05,680 --> 02:51:07,180
I posted this on Twitter, actually.

3529
02:51:07,480 --> 02:51:08,080
But...

3530
02:51:08,080 --> 02:51:08,640
I...

3531
02:51:08,640 --> 02:51:09,940
A lot of people were like...

3532
02:51:09,940 --> 02:51:10,220
Oh!

3533
02:51:10,240 --> 02:51:12,060
The controller should be plugged into...

3534
02:51:12,060 --> 02:51:12,860
Port 2!

3535
02:51:12,960 --> 02:51:13,940
Into the second port!

3536
02:51:14,060 --> 02:51:15,120
Because, you know...

3537
02:51:15,120 --> 02:51:16,560
That's what you do when you fight...

3538
02:51:16,560 --> 02:51:18,020
Psycho Mantis.

3539
02:51:18,200 --> 02:51:18,780
But...

3540
02:51:18,780 --> 02:51:19,100
Um...

3541
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:21,260
If you look closely...

3542
02:51:21,260 --> 02:51:24,780
It's plugged into the memory card slot.

3543
02:51:25,880 --> 02:51:29,140
It's not even plugged into the controller port!

3544
02:51:31,880 --> 02:51:32,520
Yeah...

3545
02:51:32,520 --> 02:51:33,820
Also, he's vibrating it.

3546
02:51:33,920 --> 02:51:35,280
So it must be the first port.

3547
02:51:35,380 --> 02:51:35,800
Exactly!

3548
02:51:36,080 --> 02:51:36,860
But also...

3549
02:51:36,860 --> 02:51:40,280
It's plugged into the memory card slot!

3550
02:51:40,840 --> 02:51:41,140
Hahaha!

3551
02:51:41,900 --> 02:51:42,540
Hahaha!

3552
02:51:42,540 --> 02:51:42,980
Hahaha!

3553
02:51:43,100 --> 02:51:43,740
Hahaha!

3554
02:51:43,740 --> 02:51:44,040
Hahaha!

3555
02:51:44,040 --> 02:51:45,040
Oh my gosh!

3556
02:51:45,100 --> 02:51:45,940
So cute!

3557
02:51:47,240 --> 02:51:48,040
Stop!

3558
02:51:48,300 --> 02:51:49,240
I'm not a nerd!

3559
02:51:52,220 --> 02:51:53,740
Anybody would notice!

3560
02:51:57,260 --> 02:51:59,100
The vibration slot!

3561
02:51:59,420 --> 02:52:00,140
Wowee!

3562
02:52:00,180 --> 02:52:01,260
Alright, last one!

3563
02:52:02,740 --> 02:52:03,240
Oh!

3564
02:52:05,580 --> 02:52:06,920
Ready to get cracking!

3565
02:52:07,760 --> 02:52:08,200
Hahaha!

3566
02:52:09,560 --> 02:52:11,180
You look so evil!

3567
02:52:12,880 --> 02:52:13,680
Heheh!

3568
02:52:15,260 --> 02:52:16,060
Bop!

3569
02:52:16,080 --> 02:52:17,200
Why was there only... Oh, out of stock!

3570
02:52:17,880 --> 02:52:20,600
Find more special boss or puzzle pieces and new gacha...

3571
02:52:20,600 --> 02:52:21,480
Oh, so...

3572
02:52:22,520 --> 02:52:26,660
I guess I was destined to get those because they're the only characters I have.

3573
02:52:31,480 --> 02:52:32,000
Spank!

3574
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:33,120
Thanks for the 30 gifted!

3575
02:52:38,280 --> 02:52:39,700
Give him his bed.

3576
02:52:41,900 --> 02:52:43,320
More stuff to get.

3577
02:52:44,160 --> 02:52:45,800
Come give me items!

3578
02:52:47,080 --> 02:52:47,560
Oh!

3579
02:52:50,340 --> 02:52:53,920
I know I just summoned you and I'm literally stealing from you.

3580
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:54,360
Come here!

3581
02:52:55,080 --> 02:52:56,060
Come here, birds!

3582
02:52:59,220 --> 02:53:00,040
Visit Snake?

3583
02:53:00,200 --> 02:53:00,580
I will!

3584
02:53:00,700 --> 02:53:01,100
Hold on!

3585
02:53:07,520 --> 02:53:08,000
Nice!

3586
02:53:08,680 --> 02:53:09,620
Oh, that was close.

3587
02:53:09,700 --> 02:53:11,000
I feel like we almost didn't get that.

3588
02:53:13,540 --> 02:53:15,500
Let's go see Snake in his box.

3589
02:53:15,500 --> 02:53:15,780
Oh!

3590
02:53:18,920 --> 02:53:20,360
Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

3591
02:53:22,880 --> 02:53:25,140
Wait, did we get anything for Ratchet?

3592
02:53:31,550 --> 02:53:32,110
Gosh!

3593
02:53:32,110 --> 02:53:33,810
The stealth camo!

3594
02:53:35,530 --> 02:53:37,010
If you hit them, they react?

3595
02:53:47,940 --> 02:53:49,780
Snake, you dog!

3596
02:53:49,940 --> 02:53:50,440
You!

3597
02:53:51,740 --> 02:53:52,300
Snake!

3598
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:54,500
Isn't a buddy girl!

3599
02:53:57,380 --> 02:53:59,020
Snake, you dog!

3600
02:53:59,320 --> 02:53:59,440
You!

3601
02:54:00,980 --> 02:54:01,740
Oh!

3602
02:54:11,380 --> 02:54:12,720
So cute!

3603
02:54:13,100 --> 02:54:14,220
Oh my gosh!

3604
02:54:16,340 --> 02:54:17,520
Oh my gosh!

3605
02:54:18,900 --> 02:54:21,180
Okay, next outfit, buddy girl outfit.

3606
02:54:24,560 --> 02:54:26,080
How embarrassing.

3607
02:54:26,580 --> 02:54:29,760
That's like the equivalent of peeing yourself, you know?

3608
02:54:32,660 --> 02:54:33,100
Oh my god!

3609
02:54:33,220 --> 02:54:33,840
Oh my god!

3610
02:54:35,260 --> 02:54:36,760
Get a hold of yourself, man!

3611
02:54:41,100 --> 02:54:42,700
That is a robot in there.

3612
02:54:49,440 --> 02:54:50,240
So cute!

3613
02:54:53,460 --> 02:54:55,040
Oh, we meant to do that!

3614
02:54:55,220 --> 02:54:55,760
Oh yeah!

3615
02:54:55,860 --> 02:54:56,740
It was all part of the plan!

3616
02:54:57,040 --> 02:54:57,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3617
02:54:57,800 --> 02:54:58,360
Ooh-ah!

3618
02:54:58,500 --> 02:54:59,480
Ooh-ah!

3619
02:54:59,720 --> 02:55:00,420
Ooh-ah!

3620
02:55:00,620 --> 02:55:01,400
Ba-da-ba-da-ba!

3621
02:55:01,400 --> 02:55:01,480
Ba!

3622
02:55:04,580 --> 02:55:05,780
So smooth.

3623
02:55:08,500 --> 02:55:09,740
So smooth.

3624
02:55:11,400 --> 02:55:12,200
Uh,

3625
02:55:19,760 --> 02:55:20,460
this one.

3626
02:55:24,310 --> 02:55:25,290
His hair.

3627
02:55:27,570 --> 02:55:29,810
This is so silly.

3628
02:55:32,570 --> 02:55:33,370
Oh!

3629
02:55:33,390 --> 02:55:33,890
Oh!

3630
02:55:34,110 --> 02:55:34,330
Oh

3631
02:55:38,770 --> 02:55:39,390
my gosh!

3632
02:55:39,590 --> 02:55:42,430
I didn't even notice that there were skelly-bots!

3633
02:55:42,570 --> 02:55:43,290
They're so cute!

3634
02:55:43,290 --> 02:55:43,910
Cute!

3635
02:55:45,970 --> 02:55:47,290
They're so, so cute.

3636
02:55:57,110 --> 02:55:58,090
Oh, that's it?

3637
02:55:58,210 --> 02:55:58,430
Okay.

3638
02:56:00,850 --> 02:56:01,450
Fun!

3639
02:56:01,810 --> 02:56:02,410
Alrighty.

3640
02:56:03,770 --> 02:56:04,910
Shall we continue?

3641
02:56:05,290 --> 02:56:06,570
The hunter hits back.

3642
02:56:10,660 --> 02:56:12,020
He parried you.

3643
02:56:12,640 --> 02:56:13,720
He's too good.

3644
02:56:15,920 --> 02:56:16,520
Alright!

3645
02:56:17,240 --> 02:56:18,100
Alright, alright.

3646
02:56:18,960 --> 02:56:20,100
Is that all for now?

3647
02:56:20,280 --> 02:56:21,520
Oh, it has been three hours.

3648
02:56:21,520 --> 02:56:22,020
You know what?

3649
02:56:22,080 --> 02:56:22,560
Maybe...

3650
02:56:23,280 --> 02:56:25,180
I will call it here, maybe.

3651
02:56:28,120 --> 02:56:30,920
Maybe I will call it here.

3652
02:56:34,100 --> 02:56:34,660
Woo!

3653
02:56:36,740 --> 02:56:38,200
Hit snake again, please.

3654
02:56:38,480 --> 02:56:38,980
Okay!

3655
02:56:41,940 --> 02:56:44,500
Yeah, good endpoint.

3656
02:56:44,740 --> 02:56:45,080
I think so.

3657
02:56:47,380 --> 02:56:48,900
I hope you guys liked this.

3658
02:56:49,400 --> 02:56:50,920
If you guys liked it...

3659
02:56:50,920 --> 02:56:52,140
Oh, you saluted me!

3660
02:56:52,320 --> 02:56:53,440
Okay, I'm going to beat him there.

3661
02:57:02,660 --> 02:57:03,700
You'll never make it, snake.

3662
02:57:03,840 --> 02:57:04,160
Come on!

3663
02:57:05,160 --> 02:57:05,880
Come on!

3664
02:57:11,050 --> 02:57:11,830
Can you make it?

3665
02:57:12,030 --> 02:57:12,310
Go!

3666
02:57:12,490 --> 02:57:12,850
Oh,

3667
02:57:28,780 --> 02:57:34,760
he's just like a little baby.

3668
02:57:37,800 --> 02:57:38,160
Oh!

3669
02:57:48,640 --> 02:57:49,720
Oh my god!

3670
02:57:49,780 --> 02:57:51,480
Wait, does it do something different every time?

3671
02:57:51,480 --> 02:57:53,080
Or like after the third time?

3672
02:57:53,600 --> 02:57:54,120
Ah!

3673
02:57:54,840 --> 02:57:55,720
Oh, no?

3674
02:57:56,180 --> 02:57:57,400
Snake is just special?

3675
02:58:13,680 --> 02:58:15,280
Some have several animations.

3676
02:58:16,680 --> 02:58:17,780
Snake is special!

3677
02:58:19,280 --> 02:58:20,420
Asuka, asuka!

3678
02:58:22,380 --> 02:58:23,340
Asuka, asuka!

3679
02:58:28,080 --> 02:58:30,260
Yeah, I think I'm going to call it here for today.

3680
02:58:30,780 --> 02:58:32,120
I hope you guys liked this.

3681
02:58:32,320 --> 02:58:33,880
I had so much more fun.

3682
02:58:33,880 --> 02:58:40,340
And... like, I know people were saying this is a really good game, but I honestly had way more fun than I expected to.

3683
02:58:41,480 --> 02:58:47,880
And I think, you know, obviously it's like... so much fun to see these characters, you know, and everything, so...

3684
02:58:49,140 --> 02:58:51,700
But the game itself is also just a lot of fun to play.

3685
02:58:54,240 --> 02:58:59,820
So... overall... probably we'll come back to this if you guys liked it, though.

3686
02:58:59,820 --> 02:59:02,640
So... yeah!

3687
02:59:03,620 --> 02:59:05,200
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

3688
02:59:08,370 --> 02:59:10,030
Because I gotta get a changing room!

3689
02:59:11,810 --> 02:59:13,170
Gotta get the changing room!

3690
02:59:19,330 --> 02:59:21,450
Didn't even feel like you were with the jet hag.

3691
02:59:23,190 --> 02:59:24,990
I'm not feeling it so much right now.

3692
02:59:25,590 --> 02:59:27,630
Hopefully I can actually fall asleep.

3693
02:59:27,870 --> 02:59:31,230
I'm kind of worried that, like, this gave me a new...

3694
02:59:31,470 --> 02:59:34,590
A bit of energy, and I won't be able to sleep until...

3695
02:59:35,130 --> 02:59:37,370
But I have to wake up early-ish tomorrow.

3696
02:59:38,230 --> 02:59:39,130
So... yeah.

3697
02:59:39,730 --> 02:59:41,150
Joy, princess, thank you!

3698
02:59:42,090 --> 02:59:44,630
Firebug, thanks for the tiny gift, and thank you so much!

3699
02:59:45,930 --> 02:59:46,450
Yeah!

3700
02:59:46,910 --> 02:59:47,430
Um...

3701
02:59:47,430 --> 02:59:49,730
Tomorrow is Holocure!

3702
02:59:50,510 --> 02:59:52,070
So... I'll be playing that.

3703
02:59:52,710 --> 02:59:54,630
And... excited, excited, excited.

3704
02:59:55,790 --> 02:59:57,370
Excited for all the games this week.

3705
02:59:57,530 --> 02:59:59,090
And karaoke on Friday.

3706
03:00:00,110 --> 03:00:01,150
And... um...

3707
03:00:01,470 --> 03:00:03,450
Metal Gear Solid 3!

3708
03:00:05,330 --> 03:00:06,590
You guys...

3709
03:00:09,490 --> 03:00:10,970
I know I have...

3710
03:00:11,470 --> 03:00:13,350
The jet lag right now.

3711
03:00:13,570 --> 03:00:13,950
Oh my gosh!

3712
03:00:14,310 --> 03:00:17,530
Thank you so much!

3713
03:00:19,230 --> 03:00:19,850
Thank you!

3714
03:00:21,950 --> 03:00:22,630
Um...

3715
03:00:24,410 --> 03:00:24,750
Um...

3716
03:00:25,190 --> 03:00:26,810
Uh... I know I...

3717
03:00:27,150 --> 03:00:28,290
Have the jet lag now.

3718
03:00:31,030 --> 03:00:33,530
Guys, I'm going back to Japan at the end of this...

3719
03:00:35,150 --> 03:00:37,690
Actually, I have to change my flight a little bit.

3720
03:00:38,590 --> 03:00:39,030
Because...

3721
03:00:39,030 --> 03:00:41,310
I was only gonna go for, like, three days.

3722
03:00:42,050 --> 03:00:43,330
For some idle stuff.

3723
03:00:43,670 --> 03:00:45,470
That's really, really, really important to me.

3724
03:00:46,490 --> 03:00:47,370
But now...

3725
03:00:47,870 --> 03:00:48,510
Oh my gosh!

3726
03:00:49,090 --> 03:00:49,530
Stop!

3727
03:00:52,650 --> 03:00:53,990
Thank you for another birthday!

3728
03:00:54,110 --> 03:00:54,690
Thank you!

3729
03:00:54,690 --> 03:00:56,110
Oh my gosh!

3730
03:00:56,230 --> 03:00:56,490
Please!

3731
03:00:56,830 --> 03:00:57,590
I know it's your birthday!

3732
03:00:57,690 --> 03:00:58,090
But please!

3733
03:00:58,130 --> 03:00:58,730
Spoil yourself!

3734
03:00:59,050 --> 03:00:59,410
It's done!

3735
03:01:00,550 --> 03:01:01,390
But, um...

3736
03:01:01,390 --> 03:01:04,750
I'm changing my date so I can also go to TGS.

3737
03:01:12,700 --> 03:01:13,660
So, um...

3738
03:01:14,740 --> 03:01:17,640
But I will only be gone for, like, a couple days.

3739
03:01:19,920 --> 03:01:21,780
Not, like, a long, long time.

3740
03:01:21,900 --> 03:01:22,660
Just a couple days.

3741
03:01:23,840 --> 03:01:25,800
That's because of the Delta booth, isn't it?

3742
03:01:26,600 --> 03:01:27,120
Yes!

3743
03:01:30,480 --> 03:01:31,000
Yes!

3744
03:01:31,100 --> 03:01:32,800
I have to play the demo!

3745
03:01:40,710 --> 03:01:41,610
Japan fun...

3746
03:01:41,610 --> 03:01:42,010
No, no.

3747
03:01:42,030 --> 03:01:43,110
Please don't support this.

3748
03:01:45,950 --> 03:01:46,990
But honestly...

3749
03:01:46,990 --> 03:01:48,290
I wasn't...

3750
03:01:48,290 --> 03:01:49,370
I wasn't going to go.

3751
03:01:50,530 --> 03:01:51,430
But, um...

3752
03:01:52,030 --> 03:01:53,550
You're straight up crazy, man.

3753
03:01:53,630 --> 03:01:53,990
Crazy.

3754
03:01:54,410 --> 03:01:55,610
I wasn't gonna go.

3755
03:01:55,710 --> 03:01:56,610
Even though...

3756
03:01:57,190 --> 03:01:57,630
Um...

3757
03:01:57,630 --> 03:01:59,570
One of my idol Oshis was graduating.

3758
03:02:01,050 --> 03:02:02,450
I was just like, you know what?

3759
03:02:03,350 --> 03:02:05,190
I guess I'll just never see her again.

3760
03:02:05,470 --> 03:02:08,030
I didn't even get to see her once this past trip.

3761
03:02:09,850 --> 03:02:10,730
So, um...

3762
03:02:10,730 --> 03:02:11,870
Uh, you know...

3763
03:02:11,870 --> 03:02:13,750
I was like, I guess I'll just never see her again.

3764
03:02:14,250 --> 03:02:15,750
And then, um...

3765
03:02:15,750 --> 03:02:16,610
Basically...

3766
03:02:17,470 --> 03:02:17,910
Um...

3767
03:02:17,910 --> 03:02:20,030
A group that I really love...

3768
03:02:20,550 --> 03:02:22,570
They disbanded in...

3769
03:02:22,570 --> 03:02:23,510
In 2020.

3770
03:02:24,810 --> 03:02:25,250
And...

3771
03:02:25,250 --> 03:02:26,590
Because it was, you know...

3772
03:02:26,590 --> 03:02:31,670
During COVID, they didn't get to have, like, a actual, like, final show.

3773
03:02:31,870 --> 03:02:33,170
It was only online.

3774
03:02:34,210 --> 03:02:34,690
But...

3775
03:02:35,530 --> 03:02:36,010
Um...

3776
03:02:36,010 --> 03:02:39,390
And at this group, I think about them basically every single day.

3777
03:02:40,710 --> 03:02:42,490
I love them so much.

3778
03:02:42,750 --> 03:02:44,930
And after they disbanded, honestly, I...

3779
03:02:44,930 --> 03:02:45,470
I...

3780
03:02:45,470 --> 03:02:48,990
It was really hard for me to get back into idols because I was, like, so...

3781
03:02:49,590 --> 03:02:51,890
I was so distraught over losing them.

3782
03:02:53,030 --> 03:02:53,510
And...

3783
03:02:53,510 --> 03:02:55,710
And just for one day...

3784
03:02:55,710 --> 03:02:57,710
For one day, they're coming back.

3785
03:02:58,250 --> 03:02:59,770
And I get to see my Oshi.

3786
03:03:00,610 --> 03:03:01,910
For one day...

3787
03:03:02,510 --> 03:03:02,990
She...

3788
03:03:02,990 --> 03:03:04,650
Is not an idol anymore.

3789
03:03:05,450 --> 03:03:05,930
So...

3790
03:03:05,930 --> 03:03:07,090
It's like...

3791
03:03:07,090 --> 03:03:08,690
A mega rare chance.

3792
03:03:09,910 --> 03:03:12,270
And she's not gonna become an idol again, probably.

3793
03:03:13,410 --> 03:03:13,890
So...

3794
03:03:14,950 --> 03:03:16,090
I was like...

3795
03:03:16,090 --> 03:03:17,070
I just...

3796
03:03:17,070 --> 03:03:18,610
I just wanna say bye to her.

3797
03:03:20,650 --> 03:03:23,210
And then, also, it was TGS at the same time.

3798
03:03:23,490 --> 03:03:25,690
So, basically, it's gonna be a very emotional...

3799
03:03:25,690 --> 03:03:26,570
A very emotional weekend for me.

3800
03:03:27,870 --> 03:03:29,270
Meeting Oshi Group 5.

3801
03:03:29,330 --> 03:03:29,810
Thank you.

3802
03:03:33,450 --> 03:03:34,830
So, I'm really sorry.

3803
03:03:36,330 --> 03:03:37,350
Oh my gosh, Paul!

3804
03:03:37,530 --> 03:03:38,410
Shut the fuck up!

3805
03:03:38,710 --> 03:03:39,410
Shut up!

3806
03:03:39,910 --> 03:03:40,430
Shut up!

3807
03:03:43,740 --> 03:03:44,920
I'm ending the stream!

3808
03:04:05,500 --> 03:04:06,680
The stars align.

3809
03:04:06,960 --> 03:04:08,320
It really feels like that.

3810
03:04:08,680 --> 03:04:11,460
I get to see my Oshi for the last time.

3811
03:04:11,680 --> 03:04:14,420
I get to see two of my Oshis for the last time ever.

3812
03:04:14,840 --> 03:04:16,480
And I get to play Delta.

3813
03:04:16,880 --> 03:04:17,340
Maybe.

3814
03:04:17,440 --> 03:04:17,860
Hopefully.

3815
03:04:18,220 --> 03:04:18,980
Fingers crossed.

3816
03:04:19,060 --> 03:04:20,600
Because TGS is kind of insane.

3817
03:04:22,780 --> 03:04:23,240
But...

3818
03:04:23,240 --> 03:04:24,740
The stars have aligned!

3819
03:04:25,320 --> 03:04:27,020
So, I feel like I have to do it.

3820
03:04:27,660 --> 03:04:28,520
I'm really sorry.

3821
03:04:28,740 --> 03:04:29,880
That I'm going back to Japan.

3822
03:04:30,180 --> 03:04:31,020
I'm really sorry.

3823
03:04:32,900 --> 03:04:33,680
I'm really sorry.

3824
03:04:34,020 --> 03:04:34,580
I'm sorry.

3825
03:04:35,180 --> 03:04:35,860
I'm sorry!

3826
03:04:36,140 --> 03:04:36,580
But...

3827
03:04:37,140 --> 03:04:39,620
And it's gonna be actually pretty close to my birthday.

3828
03:04:40,320 --> 03:04:40,780
Which...

3829
03:04:40,780 --> 03:04:41,640
If you guys don't know...

3830
03:04:41,640 --> 03:04:42,200
My birthday...

3831
03:04:42,730 --> 03:04:42,960
Is...

3832
03:04:42,960 --> 03:04:43,680
October!

3833
03:04:44,200 --> 03:04:45,680
It's October 1st!

3834
03:04:45,720 --> 03:04:47,020
October 1st is my birthday!

3835
03:04:47,340 --> 03:04:47,780
So...

3836
03:04:47,780 --> 03:04:48,900
You better come to my birthday.

3837
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:49,960
And...

3838
03:04:49,960 --> 03:04:50,600
Um...

3839
03:04:50,600 --> 03:04:52,700
I actually have two things planned for my birthday.

3840
03:04:52,940 --> 03:04:54,660
One for October 1st.

3841
03:04:54,660 --> 03:04:54,920
Hopefully.

3842
03:04:55,160 --> 03:04:56,180
If I can get it done in time.

3843
03:04:56,280 --> 03:04:57,460
And then another stream...

3844
03:04:58,440 --> 03:04:58,880
Um...

3845
03:04:58,880 --> 03:04:59,600
With...

3846
03:04:59,600 --> 03:05:00,220
Some...

3847
03:05:00,780 --> 03:05:01,220
Announcements?

3848
03:05:01,840 --> 03:05:02,280
Perhaps?

3849
03:05:12,330 --> 03:05:13,490
What could it be?

3850
03:05:13,530 --> 03:05:13,970
What could it be?

3851
03:05:13,990 --> 03:05:14,450
What could it be?

3852
03:05:16,250 --> 03:05:18,210
What could it be?

3853
03:05:18,210 --> 03:05:19,170
So...

3854
03:05:19,170 --> 03:05:19,910
Yeah!

3855
03:05:20,330 --> 03:05:20,850
Hahaha!

3856
03:05:22,150 --> 03:05:22,670
Um...

3857
03:05:23,230 --> 03:05:23,750
I...

3858
03:05:23,750 --> 03:05:25,230
I have been cooking a lot.

3859
03:05:25,590 --> 03:05:28,490
Especially since I got back from Japan.

3860
03:05:28,870 --> 03:05:29,350
Like...

3861
03:05:29,350 --> 03:05:30,830
I know I've only been back for like...

3862
03:05:30,830 --> 03:05:31,170
A day.

3863
03:05:31,330 --> 03:05:32,470
But I was like...

3864
03:05:32,470 --> 03:05:33,490
E-mailing.

3865
03:05:33,490 --> 03:05:34,310
I was...

3866
03:05:34,310 --> 03:05:34,950
Messaging.

3867
03:05:35,030 --> 03:05:36,090
I was doing...

3868
03:05:36,090 --> 03:05:36,690
I was like...

3869
03:05:36,690 --> 03:05:37,450
Pumping out stuff.

3870
03:05:38,210 --> 03:05:38,730
So...

3871
03:05:39,650 --> 03:05:40,170
Yeah!

3872
03:05:41,110 --> 03:05:41,830
Oh, shoot.

3873
03:05:41,850 --> 03:05:42,030
Sorry.

3874
03:05:42,130 --> 03:05:43,270
I'm going to Japan on that day.

3875
03:05:43,530 --> 03:05:44,050
Stop!

3876
03:05:44,790 --> 03:05:45,310
Hahaha!

3877
03:05:45,310 --> 03:05:45,730
Hahaha!

3878
03:05:46,090 --> 03:05:46,290
Hahaha!

3879
03:05:48,930 --> 03:05:49,430
Um...

3880
03:05:50,430 --> 03:05:51,050
Oh, yeah.

3881
03:05:51,850 --> 03:05:52,350
So...

3882
03:05:52,350 --> 03:05:53,030
Um...

3883
03:05:53,030 --> 03:05:55,310
I'm going to take another Japan trip in October.

3884
03:05:55,450 --> 03:05:55,630
No!

3885
03:05:56,250 --> 03:05:56,750
Hahaha!

3886
03:05:58,010 --> 03:05:59,030
I hope not.

3887
03:05:59,690 --> 03:06:00,190
Hahaha!

3888
03:06:00,530 --> 03:06:01,770
I'm so tired of...

3889
03:06:01,770 --> 03:06:02,390
I...

3890
03:06:02,390 --> 03:06:02,790
Like...

3891
03:06:02,790 --> 03:06:03,850
I think I said...

3892
03:06:03,850 --> 03:06:06,350
Me and Matara kind of mentioned this on the podcast before.

3893
03:06:06,550 --> 03:06:07,330
How like...

3894
03:06:07,330 --> 03:06:07,730
You know...

3895
03:06:08,120 --> 03:06:08,370
I...

3896
03:06:08,370 --> 03:06:08,890
I...

3897
03:06:08,890 --> 03:06:10,830
I wouldn't be able to...

3898
03:06:10,830 --> 03:06:14,090
Even go and see my Oshis if it wasn't for you guys.

3899
03:06:15,770 --> 03:06:16,270
So...

3900
03:06:16,270 --> 03:06:16,590
Like...

3901
03:06:17,390 --> 03:06:19,430
To complain just feels...

3902
03:06:19,930 --> 03:06:20,410
Like...

3903
03:06:20,410 --> 03:06:20,650
I...

3904
03:06:20,650 --> 03:06:21,810
I can't even complain.

3905
03:06:22,030 --> 03:06:22,230
You know?

3906
03:06:22,750 --> 03:06:24,590
But I am a bit traveled out.

3907
03:06:24,690 --> 03:06:25,070
Hahaha!

3908
03:06:25,090 --> 03:06:26,490
I'm a bit travel...

3909
03:06:26,490 --> 03:06:27,290
Done.

3910
03:06:27,490 --> 03:06:28,670
I'm done with traveling.

3911
03:06:28,910 --> 03:06:29,210
Hahaha!

3912
03:06:29,330 --> 03:06:31,370
I even had to decline some...

3913
03:06:31,370 --> 03:06:33,030
Some like conventions and...

3914
03:06:33,030 --> 03:06:35,370
And events and stuff that wanted me to travel there.

3915
03:06:35,510 --> 03:06:36,130
And I was like...

3916
03:06:36,130 --> 03:06:36,870
I'm sorry.

3917
03:06:37,530 --> 03:06:38,010
I...

3918
03:06:38,010 --> 03:06:38,570
I can't...

3919
03:06:38,570 --> 03:06:39,410
I can't do it.

3920
03:06:39,530 --> 03:06:40,650
I can't do it.

3921
03:06:40,990 --> 03:06:41,870
It's no good.

3922
03:06:42,110 --> 03:06:42,930
I can't do it.

3923
03:06:43,950 --> 03:06:44,850
But also...

3924
03:06:44,850 --> 03:06:45,350
I just...

3925
03:06:45,350 --> 03:06:45,610
I...

3926
03:06:45,610 --> 03:06:46,050
Also...

3927
03:06:46,050 --> 03:06:46,250
One of the things...

3928
03:06:46,250 --> 03:06:46,490
I'm gonna stream.

3929
03:06:46,850 --> 03:06:48,730
I've missed streaming so much.

3930
03:06:48,890 --> 03:06:50,890
I've missed streaming consistently so much.

3931
03:06:51,050 --> 03:06:51,770
So it's really...

3932
03:06:51,770 --> 03:06:52,530
This is me.

3933
03:06:52,730 --> 03:06:53,090
This...

3934
03:06:53,090 --> 03:06:54,570
This little robot guy is me.

3935
03:06:56,490 --> 03:06:56,970
Hahaha!

3936
03:06:58,210 --> 03:06:58,950
I'm dead.

3937
03:06:59,370 --> 03:07:00,630
I'm dead on the ground.

3938
03:07:00,970 --> 03:07:01,930
Just dead on the ground.

3939
03:07:07,810 --> 03:07:08,570
Can't do it.

3940
03:07:09,370 --> 03:07:11,650
Will you still be in Japan on October 1st?

3941
03:07:11,650 --> 03:07:14,590
I've heard a few screens in Akiba Station might be haunted then.

3942
03:07:16,810 --> 03:07:17,930
What do you mean by that?

3943
03:07:18,650 --> 03:07:19,130
I don't know.

3944
03:07:19,810 --> 03:07:20,270
I don't know.

3945
03:07:20,270 --> 03:07:20,970
What do you mean by that?

3946
03:07:24,720 --> 03:07:25,780
What do you mean by that?

3947
03:07:25,780 --> 03:07:26,480
What do you mean by that?

3948
03:07:26,520 --> 03:07:27,280
What do you mean by that?

3949
03:07:27,320 --> 03:07:27,640
What

3950
03:07:31,120 --> 03:07:31,780
do you mean by that?

3951
03:07:31,780 --> 03:07:32,680
What do you mean by that?

3952
03:07:32,760 --> 03:07:33,640
What do you mean by that?

3953
03:07:33,680 --> 03:07:34,680
What do you mean by that?

3954
03:07:34,700 --> 03:07:35,300
What do you mean by that?

3955
03:07:35,300 --> 03:07:35,340
What do you...

3956
03:07:59,170 --> 03:08:01,010
Thanks guys for the stream.

3957
03:08:01,190 --> 03:08:01,990
I had a lot of fun.

3958
03:08:02,150 --> 03:08:03,570
I hope you guys did too.

3959
03:08:04,870 --> 03:08:08,370
I will see you guys tomorrow or whenever I see you.

3960
03:08:08,610 --> 03:08:10,450
When I see you, I'll see you.

3961
03:08:16,880 --> 03:08:17,200
And...

3962
03:08:18,620 --> 03:08:19,980
I'll see you guys later!

3963
03:08:20,280 --> 03:08:20,600
Bye!

3964
03:08:20,620 --> 03:08:21,700
Bye bye!

3965
03:08:22,360 --> 03:08:23,120
Thank you!

3966
03:08:23,240 --> 03:08:23,640
Thank you!

3967
03:08:23,980 --> 03:08:24,480
Thank you!

3968
03:08:24,480 --> 03:08:24,660
Thank you!

3969
03:08:24,680 --> 03:08:24,840
Thank you!

3970
03:08:24,840 --> 03:08:24,920
Thank you!

3971
03:08:24,920 --> 03:08:25,460
Thank you!

3972
03:08:26,260 --> 03:08:27,100
Bye bye!

3973
03:08:35,480 --> 03:08:37,220
What if this was the outro instead?
