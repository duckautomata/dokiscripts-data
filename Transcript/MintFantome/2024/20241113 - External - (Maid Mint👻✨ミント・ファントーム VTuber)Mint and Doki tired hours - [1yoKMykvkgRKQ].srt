1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,280
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Nobody's here yet.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,600
We can just literally kill it.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,120
No, look!

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,420
It just refreshed!

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,680
It just refreshed!

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,960
We literally just started 5 seconds ago.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,800
Look there's Orca!

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,120
Oh... it disappeared.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,760
Stop enabling it!

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,700
You couldn't have caught out anybody.

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,540
We got the top of the list!

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,920
There's people here.

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:32,960
Hi.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:33,980
Hello.

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,760
Mint's being lazy and I'm signing.

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,060
You're not even halfway through my file!

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,900
Oh my god, we're signing...

18
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,540
It's not my fault you have experience!

19
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,100
We're signing postcards for the Phantom Thief!

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,360
Phantom Thief!

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,040
Buy tickets, guys!

22
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,420
We're signing the VIP postcards.

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,780
We're signing the VIP postcards right now.

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,940
We've got time, she'll practice.

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,420
I think we're like...

26
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,300
The fumes from the Sharpie.

27
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,820
I think so too.

28
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,540
I think it's healthy.

29
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,200
I don't know.

30
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,940
Guys, just so you guys know, we bought VIP.

31
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,020
I'm sorry we got the one that I fucked up on.

32
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,140
There's several of you guys that...

33
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,740
It's not just those several.

34
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,140
Do you think so?

35
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,080
We got every other postcard!

36
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,100
Every other postcard, you've been like, Oops, I fucked it up.

37
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,300
I really have a reference of my signature next to me.

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,680
I know, you're like staring at the screen.

39
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,960
We were dancing earlier and practicing earlier.

40
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,860
We're so tired.

41
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,380
We're so tired.

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,380
Weren't you gonna stream?

43
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,680
Yeah.

44
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,220
By the way, guys, maybe you restreamed later.

45
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,600
I still don't know.

46
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:03,680
For those who follow me and follow the Adventures of Russ Blau, literally messaged me on Discord this morning.

47
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,720
It was like, We're gonna parachute into the kingdom today!

48
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,580
I was like, Sorry, I have to dance.

49
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,300
I don't have to dance.

50
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,900
I said that there were people typing.

51
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,800
Wait, there's chat?

52
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,220
No, I don't think it's...

53
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,480
It's just replies.

54
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,200
Did you dance the Macarena?

55
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,000
I wanted to do Soldier Boy, but it was too late.

56
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,400
We finalized our setlist.

57
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,080
Yeah, and I was like, Oh my god, we could have added Soldier Boy.

58
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,220
But we finalized it like last night.

59
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,840
Sorry, whoever gets this one.

60
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,160
How did you fuck it up?

61
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,180
She's stabbing it.

62
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,920
I stabbed it accidentally.

63
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,900
She's stabbing it.

64
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,780
I stabbed it.

65
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,720
Guys, I'm sorry.

66
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,100
There's like several very special ones.

67
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,980
My handwriting is really ugly, so I don't think anybody would know which one's a special one.

68
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,700
They'll all think it's special.

69
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,160
The marker is really thick.

70
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,920
It's not!

71
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,660
The marker's a regular Sharpie marker.

72
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,260
Do you want me to go back to signing?

73
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:18,960
No.

74
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,620
Okay, yeah, get through my pile.

75
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,680
Yeah, and I know you don't actually mean it.

76
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,320
The same pile.

77
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,880
It took me like 20 minutes.

78
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
We weren't talking.

79
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,680
We weren't having a conversation.

80
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,680
We were gossiping.

81
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,440
I was like, should I just do a Twitter space?

82
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,280
So that we're sitting here and we're productive and you guys can listen to us yap.

83
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,700
Yeah, you can hear the Sharpie ASMR.

84
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,660
Can you hear it?

85
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,560
Hold on, I'm going to put the phone.

86
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,020
I've just finished my...

87
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,840
Oh my god, okay.

88
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,660
Do this one.

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,720
Okay, okay, okay.

90
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,600
Can you guys hear this?

91
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,700
Whoa.

92
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,040
Oh, new replies, but Twitter's broken.

93
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:02,740
Yeah.

94
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,920
Did they hear that?

95
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,700
No.

96
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,440
Did they hear that one?

97
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,700
I don't know.

98
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,020
I don't fucking know.

99
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
I don't do Twitter spaces.

100
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,660
I'm so tired.

101
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,480
We're so tired.

102
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,080
We still have to practice after this too.

103
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:13,700
No.

104
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,760
Yes, we do.

105
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,920
We're going to fuck it up if we don't.

106
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,980
And you know it.

107
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,900
I know.

108
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,360
You know it's a very hard dance.

109
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:21,840
I know.

110
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,420
We have a limited time because we're only together for a limited amount of time.

111
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,440
The dance requires a lot of interaction between those two.

112
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,020
Okay.

113
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,620
What are you trying to imply with that?

114
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,920
What does that mean?

115
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,020
I really want to understand it.

116
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,020
Oh my god.

117
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,340
How else do I phrase it?

118
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,580
Please enlighten me.

119
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,580
How else do I phrase that?

120
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:42,940
I don't know.

121
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,820
That dance has a lot of us having to hold each other's hands in the...

122
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,140
Oh my god.

123
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,900
The more we have gloves on.

124
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,720
Yeah, we have gloves on.

125
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,040
We have gloves on when we hold each other's hands.

126
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,420
Yeah.

127
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,100
We hate each other.

128
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,460
We don't want to touch each other's fucking bacteria.

129
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,540
We actually wear masks like 80% of the time.

130
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,020
We really do.

131
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,120
We don't want to breathe the same air.

132
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,020
Disgusting.

133
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,820
Someone said mistakes make it authentic.

134
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,420
See?

135
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,780
Well, the thing is, I'm the only one that's making mistakes.

136
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,100
Mint has fucking been all the time.

137
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,200
No, I told you that my signature is so inconsistent.

138
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,140
Those postcards are really cute, though.

139
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,920
They're really cute.

140
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,880
Too bad you can't see them right now.

141
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,820
They're very, very cute.

142
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,020
They're very cute.

143
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,140
But, like, our signature sort of blends in with the postcard, though.

144
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,380
Stop, please!

145
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,780
And the correct light, it doesn't.

146
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,080
I like the gold.

147
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,660
I know, but, like, you can only see...

148
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,700
And the correct light, it doesn't.

149
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,920
I like the gold.

150
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,080
I know, but, like, you can only see it like this, you know?

151
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,520
You do it like that, you can't...

152
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,340
No, I see it.

153
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,820
It's the opposite for me.

154
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,360
Really?

155
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,960
I see it, like, when it's, like...

156
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,880
I don't see it there.

157
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,660
I see it now.

158
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,800
Okay, when it shines, you see it, right?

159
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,340
Yeah, yeah.

160
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,460
That's what I'm trying to say.

161
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,320
It looks shiny.

162
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,040
Why is your signature so pretty?

163
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,340
You should have hired me to make your signature.

164
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,980
You know what?

165
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,400
Make me a new signature.

166
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,980
You got rid of the little pee-pee at the end, and then the...

167
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,900
That's like a bullet.

168
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,160
Oh.

169
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,160
That's what it's supposed to be.

170
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,140
What did you say?

171
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,380
It's a dick!

172
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,320
It's a bullet!

173
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,420
I'm gonna start getting rid of it now, guys.

174
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,760
This is a new crash hour.

175
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,000
It's because of what Min said.

176
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,260
I'm getting rid of the bullet in my signature.

177
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,440
What does it look like?

178
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,540
It's because of my handwriting!

179
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,560
My handwriting is perfect!

180
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,300
It looks like a...

181
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,340
Stop!

182
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,120
It's bullet-shaming!

183
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,280
You're bullet-shaming me!

184
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,120
It's a micro-bullet!

185
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,880
Look, you forgot the bullet!

186
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,000
You're just bullet-shaming me, Mom!

187
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:28,200
Guys, congratulations to the lucky whisp-goon that gets the one with no bullet.

188
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,100
Because, like, you'll know if you get that, you'll know that was when she bullet-shamed me.

189
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,360
I literally made one postcard that only has no bullet.

190
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,580
I can't!

191
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,260
I can't see, like, the new reply.

192
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:44,880
You know what?

193
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,300
I'm gonna put sad face there so people will know.

194
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Sad face?

195
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,580
Oh my god, there's a sad face!

196
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,000
There's a sad smiley on the bullet chain!

197
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,860
There's an elusive sad hand.

198
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,940
So you'll know this is the one.

199
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:09,180
I wonder if it's, like, the person who never listened to the Twitter space and then they received it and they're like, why is it sad?

200
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,880
It's like those, like, you know, the factories that receive, like, a child's letter?

201
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,240
It's just like, please help me.

202
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,280
And they're like, what's going on?

203
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,160
And they have no context.

204
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,180
They're like, oh my god, why is there a sad smiley on my postcard?

205
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:36,820
Have you seen, like, there's some, like, uh, some, like, food, like, like, uh, mac and cheese boxes or, like, some random, like, potato chip bags or whatever that will include, like, a letter that's just, like, Illuminati.

206
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,040
A bunch of numbers and people are like, what is this?

207
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,900
And it's just something that randomly has slipped into some boxes.

208
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,720
Just to fuck with people.

209
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,340
I guess.

210
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,020
I do that.

211
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,260
That's fucking hilarious.

212
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,860
Someone said, size doesn't matter, it's how you shoot it.

213
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,520
Jira, bullets still kills.

214
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,380
No matter what.

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,160
As long as they're dead, it's fine.

216
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh my god.

217
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:15,120
Guys, I hope, I do hope the person that gives my sad, the not, the no more, the bullet shamed postcard actually understands the context.

218
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,860
And not some random...

219
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,300
Yeah, if someone, if someone sees that their friend get this, you have to have, like, explain it to them.

220
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:21,800
Give them the context.

221
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,120
Yeah.

222
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,320
Because I even gave a, I even put a frown face and I don't want them to think that I'm being abused right now.

223
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,420
I don't think they would have thought that.

224
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,340
I put a face, I was like, why did she put a face?

225
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,520
Why is she so sad?

226
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,920
Why did she put a sad face on my postcard?

227
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,320
Clearly she's being abused.

228
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,740
Like, abused mentally by me.

229
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,140
I don't want them to think that.

230
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,380
They'll be like, oh my god, am I supporting a sweatshop?

231
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,300
Oh, I'm so tired.

232
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,960
And you still have to practice, you can't be tired.

233
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,760
I'm so tired.

234
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,360
This is a sweatshop.

235
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,120
Maybe we are, maybe we are.

236
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,820
Signing postcards and now with the dancing lady.

237
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:23,040
I signed postcards for Patreon, I signed postcards for concert, my life is postcards, never ending hell.

238
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,420
You told me how many postcards she has left to sign.

239
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,580
Because of the...

240
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,900
There's more in that bag.

241
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,360
I know, there's more, but we still have this pile too.

242
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,060
What do you mean?

243
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,660
How is this 200?

244
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,380
I don't know.

245
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,420
It feels like I'm signing 500 postcards.

246
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,460
Maybe it's extra.

247
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,300
Oh my god, I'm counting these, so I signed exactly 200.

248
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:48,960
We should number them.

249
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,000
True!

250
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,820
Guys, we're going to start numbering.

251
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,660
Okay, we're going to give ourselves more work now.

252
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,760
We're going to number them.

253
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,020
I'm putting number 1 on the sad one.

254
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:01,940
Okay.

255
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,880
But she shouldn't be sad.

256
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,880
Okay, no, no, no, that's the last one.

257
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,980
That's the last one?

258
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,680
Oh, 200.

259
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,500
Okay, whoever gets 200.

260
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,300
We don't put 200 on it yet, we don't know.

261
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,400
Oh, actually, yeah.

262
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,020
Or should we put it in the back?

263
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,620
Guys, front or back?

264
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,160
Oh, we can't really read that properly though.

265
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,320
Front or back?

266
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,780
I can't see the new replies.

267
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,680
Wait, is it because you're on a fucking Android?

268
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:29,740
Yeah.

269
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,620
Here!

270
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,580
Here!

271
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,060
Oh my god, you're so stupid!

272
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:45,240
Okay, so basically, there's the most relevant replies, you click it, and you can sort by most recent.

273
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,980
You're so stupid.

274
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,300
Okay, okay.

275
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,240
You're like, oh, you finally have something against me for the bullet.

276
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,660
Whatever.

277
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,300
You're so technologically inept.

278
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,620
All right.

279
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,040
I think she's talking about you!

280
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,530
They're talking about you staying up mumbling!

281
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,350
Refresh.

282
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,610
Oh my god!

283
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,390
You have to click it every time?

284
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,190
This sucks!

285
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,510
Oh my god, they think of a better way!

286
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,330
Okay,

287
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,570
let's see.

288
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,730
Okay, front.

289
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,230
Someone says front.

290
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,890
Literally one person.

291
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,910
Oh, back, front.

292
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,010
Front, back, back, front.

293
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,290
Back, say back.

294
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,130
Because they're gonna display it.

295
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,230
Someone's gonna be like, I'm number one!

296
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,810
Okay, 200 on the sad one.

297
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,490
200 on the sad one.

298
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,030
Lucky 200.

299
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,170
Wait, we should make it silver.

300
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,230
No, make it consistent.

301
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:00,890
Why silver?

302
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:01,930
Because it's numbered.

303
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,730
But it's gotta be the same as always.

304
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,270
But it's like not, you can't see it.

305
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,190
I can see it!

306
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,670
Why did we sign all these in gold?

307
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,450
No, I meant the numbers!

308
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,650
Oh, no, I can see it.

309
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,250
I can see it.

310
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,030
Yeah, because the light hits it.

311
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,230
It'll hit it.

312
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,650
The light exists everywhere.

313
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,750
Yeah, but like, okay, if I do it like this...

314
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,850
You see it properly.

315
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,810
It says 200.

316
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:28,410
Yeah, but it's so hard because there's like red and purple on there.

317
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,490
Then we should have done all the signatures.

318
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,230
No, because we put it in gold.

319
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,030
Wait, number is a different color.

320
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:34,890
It makes sense.

321
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,950
Guys, okay, guys...

322
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,650
Numbers in different colors are the same color.

323
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,840
Yeah, numbers in different colors are the same color.

324
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,430
Guys, make a poll.

325
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,050
Don't just ask.

326
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,030
Someone said have odd numbers, one color, and even numbers, another color.

327
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,070
You're trying to kill us!

328
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,970
Guys, we don't...

329
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:56,390
Like, I don't want to say we don't care enough because we care about you guys, but somebody else doesn't care enough.

330
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,570
I do it.

331
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,390
I do it.

332
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,030
Yeah, I do it.

333
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,010
Get off the floor.

334
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:01,650
I do it.

335
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,010
I'm trying to get the supermarket to drop.

336
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,190
It's not me.

337
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,090
We know it's the desk that dropped it.

338
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,110
We literally blamed the desk earlier together.

339
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,890
I didn't.

340
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:12,890
I didn't.

341
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,290
You have no proof.

342
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,610
I'm gonna write one that really just says, like, help me.

343
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,750
Help me, please.

344
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:22,830
I am trapped.

345
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,170
This is my sad face.

346
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,030
I'm gonna put that in silver.

347
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,970
This is my sad face.

348
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,590
They're gonna be so stoked.

349
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,150
Are you crossing it out?

350
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,070
Look!

351
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,450
It's so much better.

352
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,430
It looks the same.

353
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,390
No, it's not.

354
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,610
Oh, it does look better.

355
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,130
I told you!

356
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:47,450
I fucking know color more than you!

357
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,410
Maybe you should've signed it in silver.

358
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,670
It actually looks a lot better.

359
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,570
We tested it, though.

360
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,530
Where's the test one?

361
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:55,870
Over there?

362
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:56,650
Yeah.

363
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,910
What's the silver look like?

364
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,710
But silver doesn't match the colors as well.

365
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,310
Oh, true.

366
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,330
The silver one for when it hits that.

367
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,570
Yeah, it doesn't look good.

368
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,910
But up here in the corner, it looks fine.

369
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,210
Who the fuck drew this cat in the corner?

370
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,070
I think...

371
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,670
I mean, I don't know.

372
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,170
It was already on there.

373
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,170
Oh, it was already on there.

374
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,430
Whoever gave us the postcards.

375
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:17,030
Yeah.

376
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:19,670
Okay.

377
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:20,770
Alright.

378
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,990
The divorce is delayed, guys.

379
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,370
Because we came to an agreement on the colors.

380
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,610
On the colors!

381
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,820
Okay, well then, I'll start numbering the ones that...

382
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,390
Yeah, oh, it's true.

383
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,430
You can start numbering them.

384
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:38,790
Yeah.

385
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,310
Oh, the one should be the helping one.

386
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,310
Where is this helping one?

387
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,870
We haven't written it yet.

388
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,910
We'll get there now.

389
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,190
Wait, so that's going to be number one?

390
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,250
Yeah, it should be number one.

391
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,410
Okay, then I'll start with 002.

392
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,390
Why are you putting 00?

393
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,210
Because it's like 00200.

394
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,130
Just write two!

395
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,630
No, that's not fun!

396
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,450
Why not put an extra number?

397
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,950
Because it's like 001, 003.

398
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,230
I don't care!

399
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,430
I'd rather see something that writes one.

400
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,650
So I'll be like, I'm number one.

401
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,610
You won't be as number one.

402
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,870
It's like 007!

403
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,250
When you get to seven, you can write 007.

404
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,290
It's not funny to write 069.

405
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,790
It looks so ugly!

406
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,150
See?

407
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:31,450
You write them all.

408
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,370
I give up.

409
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,630
I'm done signing.

410
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,290
She wrote 001 and it looks horrible.

411
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,130
You guys did divorces back on it?

412
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,390
It looks ugly.

413
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,350
See?

414
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:48,950
See?

415
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,630
Linda's correct.

416
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,350
The extra digits make it feel more official.

417
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,070
See?

418
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:52,330
See?

419
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:54,290
Look!

420
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,450
Leading 007!

421
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:56,970
That's two!

422
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,910
Two for me, two for me, two for me.

423
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,430
Like the anime 009.

424
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:02,630
See?

425
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,070
Oh, one out of 200.

426
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:08,990
That's too much work, actually.

427
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,710
Oh, out of the 200?

428
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,830
Yeah, that's a lot of work.

429
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,490
We agree.

430
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,410
We agree on something.

431
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,370
I think...

432
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,570
You know what?

433
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,670
Okay, it'll be so sad if it's just one.

434
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,950
No, it's not.

435
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,110
It's so sad if it's just one number.

436
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,150
We last did this for like three years ago.

437
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,690
I wrote 001.

438
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,670
I just wrote one.

439
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:38,770
Actually, no.

440
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,570
It might have been 01.

441
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,850
But it was out of 100.

442
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,950
No, because it was out of 100.

443
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,670
No!

444
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,710
Not on this computer.

445
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,470
No, I prefer...

446
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,210
Okay, guys, we can't say what it is.

447
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,650
Remember the last time we gave you autographs?

448
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,210
A very long time ago.

449
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,710
Paige, you were number one.

450
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:07,550
Did we write 001 or did we write one?

451
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:16,290
If you had a specific wallpaper that had a message from us and a number...

452
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,590
Oh, Paige is here.

453
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,230
Paige!

454
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,370
Did you write 001 or one?

455
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,070
Paige was number one for me.

456
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,610
I don't remember who was number one for me.

457
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:26,030
Wow.

458
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,190
You both sold out.

459
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,890
I remember.

460
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:34,830
Where are you?

461
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,450
See?

462
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,050
I wrote 001!

463
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,110
Oh my god.

464
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:40,910
I'm consistent.

465
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,250
I'm consistent.

466
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,290
Thank you, Paige.

467
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,910
It's not fair because she's just agreeing with you.

468
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,770
What?

469
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,150
No.

470
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,170
It's because I'm consistent.

471
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,610
I know it looks better.

472
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,910
Because it's like three digits.

473
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,410
200 is three digits.

474
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,710
And so you go up with the digits.

475
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,550
I just think it looks ugly.

476
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,130
I think it looks ugly.

477
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,910
I think it just...

478
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,170
You don't...

479
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,910
Oh, you can't even fucking say words.

480
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:11,950
Okay.

481
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,350
When I get...

482
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,130
Numbles.

483
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,970
When I get numbered stuff, I want it to say number one because it's clean.

484
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,210
Clean.

485
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,750
I like it when it's clean.

486
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,110
Someone else said mint is correct.

487
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,170
It's because the Twitter space is on your account.

488
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,370
Okay, well then you start your own Twitter space and you can ask for everything.

489
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,190
We just have a Twitter space.

490
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,790
Do a double.

491
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,770
Double Twitter spaces.

492
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,730
It's just being unproductive at that point.

493
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,210
It's just stupid.

494
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,730
Can we just get through the pile and then we'll be done for tonight.

495
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,770
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

496
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,830
I have nine more to do.

497
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,810
There's no way.

498
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,250
I'm pretty sure that's like a lot of extras.

499
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:02,910
I'm pretty sure.

500
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:03,850
There's no way.

501
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,070
It feels like...

502
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:10,210
When I order them, they come in packs of 250.

503
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,190
So it might be 250.

504
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,810
Okay, so we just don't have to do the little extra 50.

505
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,010
We might as well.

506
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,230
We'll do 20 extra.

507
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,270
We'll see how we feel when we get to the end.

508
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,030
Yeah, I know.

509
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:26,810
It might be fine.

510
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,490
We're already complaining.

511
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,330
We're already complaining.

512
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,050
Doki, you wrote number 039 for my autographed item.

513
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,730
Doki!

514
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,350
To be fair, we have consistent rules.

515
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,010
I think...

516
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,910
You are not able to resist!

517
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:55,990
This is a personal preference, but I'm pretty sure for those, there was a strict guideline.

518
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,490
More digits feel fuller.

519
00:20:59,170 --> 00:20:59,810
Fine.

520
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,290
See?

521
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,370
You're not winning this.

522
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:01,890
I'm sorry.

523
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:02,330
Fine!

524
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:05,570
Just because I have paper plates doesn't mean...

525
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:13,710
Just because you have actual utensils at home doesn't mean that you're right.

526
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,150
Yeah, I eat off of actual dinner plates.

527
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,730
Yeah.

528
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,230
You guys...

529
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,330
Just because she has her life together doesn't mean she's right.

530
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,210
My afterlife.

531
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,150
I'm dead.

532
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,950
I'm dead and I have more of a life together than you do.

533
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,710
Doki is close enough to sniff for real.

534
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,470
Shut the hell up!

535
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,890
She keeps leaning on me while getting on my phone.

536
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,070
You have your weirdos in here.

537
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,130
Why does Doki sound sexier than usual?

538
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,570
Look at her facepalm.

539
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,370
Are you trying to say your fans don't say the same thing?

540
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,950
They're fine.

541
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,830
You don't think you're sexy?

542
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,470
They don't think I'm sexy and that's fine.

543
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,510
What do they think of you?

544
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:13,750
I don't know.

545
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,610
What do you guys think of me?

546
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,150
Am I kicking my feet?

547
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:24,730
What are we?

548
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:25,810
Chat, what are we?

549
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,830
What is she to you guys?

550
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,690
What are we now?

551
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,130
What do they say?

552
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:32,670
I don't know.

553
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,370
She's freaky.

554
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,910
She's freaky.

555
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,890
Yeah, but that's not...

556
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,870
That's not a thing.

557
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,790
What, freaky?

558
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,170
No.

559
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,470
Wait, what?

560
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,450
Why do they watch you?

561
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,110
Because you're freaky?

562
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,550
Yeah, we're all freaky.

563
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,290
You're all freaky?

564
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:55,870
Yeah.

565
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,330
What did you do to them?

566
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:03,630
I have enabled them to unleash their inner freak.

567
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,490
I mean, you fucking stalked them.

568
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:06,250
I know.

569
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,490
I mean...

570
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:17,630
I like how at first the Dragoons were like, why doesn't she do that to us too?

571
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,050
Guys, I look at your tweets and replies even the ones that you don't tag.

572
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,170
I just don't say anything.

573
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:23,730
What?

574
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,330
You want the satisfaction?

575
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,130
You're enabling it.

576
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,430
When someone follows me, I go to their profile.

577
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,650
Every fan?

578
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,610
No, sometimes it'll pop up and I'll be like, who is this?

579
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,470
I was like, your notifications must be fucking hell.

580
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,350
Yeah, because it's not...

581
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,390
I used to have it where it was only people I follow that would show notifications.

582
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,070
But now it's everybody.

583
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,010
Oh, what?

584
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,550
You actually unleashed it?

585
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,210
Yeah, I unleashed it.

586
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,790
But I miss a lot because of that.

587
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,670
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

588
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,870
You miss a lot of notifications.

589
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,570
But then I also see who follows me and then I go to their profile.

590
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:08,650
She was telling me about one wisp that was doing a marathon.

591
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,550
I was just being like, who's doing?

592
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:19,010
I told her, I was like, you're living my tears through this guy right now.

593
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,470
I was like, that's like...

594
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,290
You like this anime character, okay.

595
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,570
What did he say?

596
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:30,830
Oh my god!

597
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,130
You ripped your chair in time!

598
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,670
I'm okay, I ripped the chair in time.

599
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,550
Cap that before you...

600
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,790
No, but I own my pants!

601
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,370
Doki is a freak too.

602
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,190
The fact that she doesn't enable us is part of the fun.

603
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,970
So they're just like bursting at the seams.

604
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,390
Oh my god, do you think she read this?

605
00:24:59,390 --> 00:24:59,850
Exactly!

606
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:05,110
The fun part for me is they're like paranoid because they're like, do you think she read this?

607
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,990
Do you think I posted this?

608
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,250
Do you think she ever read this?

609
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,170
She might be here right now.

610
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,050
And that's the thrill for me.

611
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,970
We have two different thrills, you guys.

612
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,250
She likes it when you know that she's stalking you.

613
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,030
Yeah, I'm stalking you, but also you don't know when I'm gonna show up.

614
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:29,390
And then for me, I like it when you guys don't know when or when I'm not there.

615
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,610
No, she's not taking off my pants!

616
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,010
I'm wearing pants and I don't want sharpie on them because they were expensive!

617
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,050
Yeah, they look like expensive.

618
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,790
They're like less material, though.

619
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,770
Well, it's just the lace.

620
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,750
Yeah, ooh, guys, there's lace here.

621
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,230
Yeah.

622
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,330
Guys, I'm touching the lace part.

623
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,030
Oh, I see.

624
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,210
Earlier in my life, you gave her so much.

625
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:00,790
Oh, the one time out of like 20 years I say something.

626
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,810
How long has it been?

627
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,090
How long have you been dead?

628
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,270
Yeah, I want apple juice.

629
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,070
Thank you.

630
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,230
Domestic life now.

631
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,590
I like these bottles, they're cute.

632
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,010
They're shaped like apples.

633
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,310
Drink your apple a day.

634
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,790
We got free apple juice.

635
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,730
Oh my god.

636
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:31,450
Here we go.

637
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:32,910
Yay!

638
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,330
Guys, I don't know if I can stream today.

639
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,050
We have to practice dance later.

640
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,830
We're very tired.

641
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,150
We are very tired.

642
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,250
How many hours did we practice dance session earlier?

643
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,030
It was like...

644
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,510
What, we got done at 7?

645
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,930
No, we got there at like 11.

646
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:03,330
11?

647
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,930
No, we got there at 12.

648
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,290
12 to 7.

649
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,610
It was a 7 hour dance session that we had.

650
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,530
And it wasn't even the dance we needed to practice the most.

651
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:15,050
I know.

652
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,270
I know.

653
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,210
So we're doing our actual practice later today.

654
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:23,770
But how long?

655
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,750
What, we do it twice?

656
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,830
And then we're like, okay, good night.

657
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:30,470
At least like an hour, I feel like we should.

658
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:35,830
It's like, you know, it's that dance has a lot of interaction and stuff.

659
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,310
I'm on my last one.

660
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:42,070
Yeah, we have barely made a dent.

661
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,690
You didn't even write numbers!

662
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,830
We agreed to the number system and you didn't.

663
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,730
Okay, okay.

664
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,970
It's like 1 in 200, that's it.

665
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,990
We've been talking for so long.

666
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,950
I couldn't have gotten to 200.

667
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,650
Yeah, but we could have gotten at least a 20.

668
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,850
Yeah, now it's my turn.

669
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,410
Your turn to write.

670
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,510
Zero...

671
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,930
I'm gonna be writing even more after this.

672
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,990
Zero, zero, four.

673
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,310
Zero...

674
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,330
Guys, I don't think that's a square.

675
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,430
Zero, five.

676
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,070
Yeah, me counting to 100.

677
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,150
Zero...

678
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:29,530
Guys...

679
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,410
I'll go to 110.

680
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,470
Zero, zero, seven.

681
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,990
Guys, Mick told me some secrets today.

682
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,190
Whoa, that's all I'm gonna say.

683
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,330
There was something I was gonna say earlier.

684
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,650
I don't remember what it was.

685
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,030
What could it be?

686
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,150
Are you dying?

687
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,510
The air's really dry here.

688
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,610
It's so dry.

689
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:57,030
Zero, one, zero.

690
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,910
It's so dry here, guys.

691
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:03,950
Apple juice.

692
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,430
It's good for your throat.

693
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,690
What are you saying now?

694
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:09,710
What?

695
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,210
What are you guys saying?

696
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,730
What are you guys saying?

697
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,810
My friend told me something.

698
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,630
She was like, don't tell your fans this.

699
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,310
I told her something about my fans.

700
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,630
She was like, don't tell them that you feel this way or else they're gonna get really crazy.

701
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:29,530
Wait, what?

702
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,850
I can't say it on here.

703
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:31,970
Type it.

704
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,870
What if I accidentally say it?

705
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:36,790
I don't think you will.

706
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,070
Secret Neopets codes.

707
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,890
What does that mean?

708
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,590
I wanna know.

709
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,310
Type it.

710
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:45,750
Why not?

711
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,510
Because then you might say it.

712
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,190
True.

713
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,610
What if I say it?

714
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:54,030
What if I don't say it?

715
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,810
Yuki, please don't die.

716
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,430
I'll try my best, guys.

717
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,310
But I'm like sitting next to Min right now.

718
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,990
I'm stealing the life energy.

719
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,990
It's how I eat.

720
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,490
Come on, get off my back.

721
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,490
She told her friend that she loves him.

722
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,990
I saw that.

723
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,310
I saw that.

724
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,510
Yuki can't be trusted.

725
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,910
I can't be trusted.

726
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,650
Osni is even saying that.

727
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,030
That guy knows everything.

728
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,310
Osni said that?

729
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:35,490
He said, Dragoon over Wisp.

730
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,510
That's true.

731
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,390
I know you guys.

732
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,630
You guys know us.

733
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:52,350
Yeah.

734
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,010
Especially this freak here.

735
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,670
Get a humidifier.

736
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,250
You hear that?

737
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,030
Oh no, now I'm coughing too.

738
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:02,490
That's right.

739
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,330
I'm gonna get her sick if she can't stream.

740
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,290
You said you weren't sick.

741
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,910
I said I wasn't.

742
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,710
Oh my god.

743
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,510
Who's quote retweeting this?

744
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,210
You're socking quote retweets?

745
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,630
Now we're sick.

746
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,070
Documento podcast.

747
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:20,930
Absolutely.

748
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,550
Don't bullish me.

749
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,150
Our little podcast.

750
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,310
Our little podcast.

751
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:35,490
Just because you got tired of me slowly doing my autographs.

752
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,150
Well, it helped.

753
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:37,490
It worked.

754
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,250
I was gonna get to it eventually.

755
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:45,350
I was doing it faster without the podcast because I'm arguing with you.

756
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:46,350
What?

757
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:51,090
I was literally doing it much faster.

758
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,810
What would we collab?

759
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:56,870
Massage.

760
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,250
I'd even play massage.

761
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,630
You play it.

762
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,790
Yeah, and then you'd be here.

763
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,550
I'll drink too because I can't get through with that.

764
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,610
I don't want to be with you drunk.

765
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,230
You can drink too.

766
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,350
I don't drink.

767
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:11,650
You don't, you're right.

768
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,610
You're gonna be like the designated...

769
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,370
I'll be like fucking sober.

770
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,810
The designated driver.

771
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:26,990
Now you know how I feel when I have to deal with you sober.

772
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,010
I'm always sober.

773
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,650
But you act drunk.

774
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,430
Just because I turned autocorrect off doesn't mean I'm drunk.

775
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,890
Drunk orc massage.

776
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,870
Our channels will just get banned.

777
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,330
Yeah.

778
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,330
She actually played through the whole game.

779
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:43,890
Me?

780
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,750
No, I bought it though.

781
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,110
You said you played up to a certain point.

782
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:49,790
No, I didn't.

783
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,470
Did you even play it at all?

784
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,350
I haven't played it yet, I just bought it.

785
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,250
Oh, mortuary assistant?

786
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,310
Yeah, they updated.

787
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,830
They haven't updated at all.

788
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,010
No, I think they did update it.

789
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,550
Oh my god, my pants, my expensive pants.

790
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,190
Okay, you did that to yourself.

791
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,990
What?

792
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,250
I don't know why I did that.

793
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,010
You're literally picking on it right now.

794
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:12,570
No, but look at it.

795
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,870
I did that by itself.

796
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,910
No, I love these pants.

797
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,150
Just cut it.

798
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,050
Yeah, I will.

799
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,210
Just cut that thread and then it'll be okay.

800
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:20,730
Okay.

801
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,130
I'll get scissors.

802
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,910
Oh wait, I have scissors in my bathroom.

803
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,290
Okay, guys.

804
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,490
Let's play the quiet game with me.

805
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:39,190
Whoever is the most quiet wins this game.

806
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,170
It's a fun game, guys.

807
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,370
If you guys want to win in the video game.

808
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,570
Let's play the quiet game with Uncle Doki now.

809
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,040
We lost the quiet game.

810
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,680
Shut up!

811
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,180
We were having a fun time.

812
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,500
We were having a fun quiet game time and you made us lose.

813
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,680
Guys, I'm not going to talk so you can hear her change her pants.

814
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,440
But I didn't want to practice enough because I didn't want to get sweaty in my pajamas.

815
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,280
So, no practice.

816
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,360
I brought Cinnamoroll.

817
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,200
Oh, that's cute.

818
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,120
Yeah, I think I brought Cinnamoroll pajamas too.

819
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,360
Cinnamoroll pajamas.

820
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:53,840
Doki always busts out the quiet game when she has a visitation of the Whispersoons.

821
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,180
True.

822
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,980
It's quiet.

823
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,520
It's the quiet game, everybody.

824
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,960
The worst dad.

825
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,020
Time for quiet.

826
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,940
3, 2, 1, quiet.

827
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,960
Oh, you lost the quiet game.

828
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,160
You lost the quiet game.

829
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,320
I'm sleepy.

830
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,680
We're so tired.

831
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,200
Guys, we're so...

832
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:29,900
Oh, hey, look.

833
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,900
Oh my god, she started listening to your speech.

834
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,660
I should listen to it too.

835
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,760
I should listen.

836
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,520
Oh my god.

837
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,420
Wait, actually.

838
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,120
Request to be a speaker.

839
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,540
I'll go to the bathroom.

840
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,160
Okay, okay.

841
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,480
Okay, hold on.

842
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,940
Wait, hold on, guys.

843
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,580
Did you request?

844
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,840
Oh, wait, wait.

845
00:35:59,140 --> 00:35:59,460
Yeah, sorry.

846
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:04,650
Okay.

847
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:07,870
Okay.

848
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,550
Did you request?

849
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,840
I don't see you.

850
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:16,600
Oh.

851
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,820
It literally...

852
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,720
It literally says zero requests.

853
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,240
Look, look, look, look.

854
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,700
Look, look, look right here.

855
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,600
Look right here.

856
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,200
It says zero...

857
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,500
How am I supposed to refresh it?

858
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,080
Oh, forward.

859
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,960
Oh my god.

860
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,560
Look right here.

861
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:37,960
No.

862
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,700
Stop, stop it.

863
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,020
Stop the stream.

864
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,740
Stop the stream.

865
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,280
I'm trying.

866
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,280
Oh my god.

867
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,580
Literally, you can't refresh a...

868
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,360
Refresh your Twitter.

869
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,660
Yeah.

870
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,920
It showed someone else requesting.

871
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,060
Oh, wait, wait.

872
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,170
Okay, hold on.

873
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,450
Look, it shows this person.

874
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,270
Can you turn it off, please?

875
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,990
So I can walk over to you.

876
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,770
See, it shows me...

877
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:30,230
Yeah, it shows me this person, but no one else.

878
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,330
See, only one request.

879
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,170
It's a space.

880
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:37,090
It only shows one person.

881
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,550
Who the fuck is that?

882
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,610
Try coming in again.

883
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:41,490
Try coming in again.

884
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,150
Okay.

885
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,980
It didn't work.

886
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,240
Oh my god!

887
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,380
Wait, maybe if I find you...

888
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,440
If I find you, I can invite you.

889
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,480
It says you're not listening.

890
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,460
Yes, I am!

891
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,020
Idiot!

892
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,300
Wait, maybe if I find you...

893
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:13,620
Hold on.

894
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,140
If I find you, I can invite you.

895
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,840
I requested so many times.

896
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:21,880
Idiot!

897
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,240
I can adjust the settings.

898
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,220
Wait, now it says 11 people requested to speak.

899
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:28,680
Hold on.

900
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:31,940
Nevermind.

901
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,320
I give up.

902
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,140
Turn it off.

903
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:35,780
Turn it off.

904
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,720
Turn it off.

905
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,740
It's not me!

906
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,460
Twitter is a broken site!

907
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,000
Twitter...

908
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,380
Okay, then here we go.

909
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:46,960
You do it.

910
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,440
Give me your phone.

911
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:51,980
Alright.

912
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:53,580
Request.

913
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,620
No, don't go yet!

914
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,500
Request the thing first!

915
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,880
I don't know how to use Android!

916
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,400
What do you want me to do?

917
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,020
How do I do this?

918
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,980
Request to speak.

919
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,180
You know how to Android?

920
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,040
I don't know how to Android!

921
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,400
I literally told you I don't know how to Android.

922
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,320
Okay, okay.

923
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,080
Give me a sec.

924
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:13,820
I'm tired.

925
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,580
I'm so tired.

926
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,180
Okay.

927
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,280
Give me a sec.

928
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,260
I'm really tired right now.

929
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,040
Okay.

930
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,040
Yes.

931
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,520
That's right.

932
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,160
And I am...

933
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,620
Only the top 500 people can listen?

934
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,780
I'm not even in the top 500!

935
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,200
Okay, I can invite you as a co-host.

936
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,280
Wait, if I invite you to a co-host, does that count?

937
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,580
Yeah, but I search your name and it didn't show up.

938
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:48,980
Okay.

939
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,420
Okay.

940
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,800
Yes, I did.

941
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,980
I'm not in this space.

942
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,840
Wait, why am I...

943
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,980
Why am I not in this space?

944
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,320
Okay, wait.

945
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,480
I'll restart my Twitter.

946
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,700
Give me my phone.

947
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,700
I'll restart it.

948
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,360
Stop throwing them around.

949
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:06,980
They're delicate.

950
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:07,960
Are you guys okay?

951
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,900
Yeah, but they're listening on this phone.

952
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,540
Yeah!

953
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,500
She's throwing you guys around!

954
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,600
Like you're a rag doll!

955
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,320
I dropped you guys as a baby.

956
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:21,980
I'm sorry.

957
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,580
This is so sad.

958
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,340
I love you guys more than she does.

959
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,100
That's why I'm the weekend dad.

960
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,080
That's why she's the weekend dad.

961
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,440
I requested it again.

962
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,100
Oh, you did?

963
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,980
It shows that I have 10 requests to speak, and then when I go to it, they don't...

964
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,740
No!

965
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,460
You literally don't even show up, and it won't...

966
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,660
I think I just have to end it.

967
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,160
No, that's fine.

968
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,620
I don't need to be in there.

969
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,320
I'm literally in the same room as you.

970
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,760
Why do you want me to request?

971
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,580
I'm literally in the same room.

972
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,720
I just thought it'd be funny.

973
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,280
Get on my bed.

974
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,220
Get on her bed, guys.

975
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,020
I'm so tired.

976
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,400
Let's practice the dance, we can't.

977
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,760
We have to practice dancing.

978
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,760
Can we just lay on the bed instead?

979
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,720
I mean, we technically can.

980
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,480
This is going to be an ASMR sleep stream now.

981
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,280
We can practice while laying down.

982
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,220
That's true.

983
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,560
Let's spoil demolish that list.

984
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,980
I'm dancing in my head.

985
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,500
And then the kicky.

986
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,400
The kick.

987
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,920
And then the...

988
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,920
You know, like when we do the twist to the front?

989
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:40,580
Uh-huh.

990
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,720
And then we do this thing.

991
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,300
And there's one where we have to do a heart.

992
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,440
And then...

993
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,340
I don't know if we can do the heart, though.

994
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,040
They'll fix it.

995
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,140
They can fix it.

996
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,020
I'll try.

997
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,420
They can adjust it.

998
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,880
We're tired, guys.

999
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,640
It's been a long day.

1000
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,440
Can they even hear us?

1001
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,780
They can.

1002
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,600
They should be able to.

1003
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,500
We're tired.

1004
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,620
When we fall asleep, then you'll just hear us snore.

1005
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,240
You'll hear Doki fart.

1006
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,000
Oh, the real scoop.

1007
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:21,820
She's gonna blow her nose.

1008
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,880
Where the fuck is the tissue?

1009
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,400
I don't know.

1010
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,060
In the bathroom.

1011
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,340
Oh, it's in the bathroom.

1012
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,180
Guys, I'm not sick, by the way.

1013
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,980
If I am sick, then we know who to blame.

1014
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,440
I will throw the tissue in your room.

1015
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,440
Why did you put your socks on the bed?

1016
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,380
Those are unused.

1017
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,300
Okay.

1018
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,680
Oh, my God.

1019
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,960
Look, they're pizza socks.

1020
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,700
Are you gonna wear them tomorrow?

1021
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,240
I was going to, but they're kind of high.

1022
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,480
I didn't want to get bunched up.

1023
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,760
It says yummy.

1024
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:17,820
Yummy pizza!

1025
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,000
I'm holding her socks right now.

1026
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,820
Oh, my God, guys.

1027
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:24,960
Smelly socks.

1028
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,780
My yummy pizza socks.

1029
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,600
Did we put this on auction?

1030
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,200
No, I like my socks.

1031
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,940
I don't want to sell my socks.

1032
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,260
I like these ones.

1033
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,180
Not even for charity.

1034
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:37,980
You hate charity.

1035
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:38,640
I don't.

1036
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,740
Not even for charity.

1037
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,900
When did it become a charity auction, huh?

1038
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,160
Auction out of greed?

1039
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,540
Out of your own pocket?

1040
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,460
We see the socks.

1041
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,000
I wear these out, though.

1042
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,520
So, no, you can't.

1043
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,040
Look at all the ankles now.

1044
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,920
Sorry, you can't see my socks.

1045
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,000
Look at everybody's ankles.

1046
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,920
If you're like, we gotta find...

1047
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,840
Yeah, but I literally said yummy pizza.

1048
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,000
Nothing, you gotta look for yummy pizza.

1049
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,880
Fine, I guess I'll just throw these out then.

1050
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,180
Because I'll never think I want to wear them out again.

1051
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,620
Oh, my God.

1052
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,300
You literally read out the text.

1053
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,200
I just called them my pizza socks.

1054
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,360
And you ruined it.

1055
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,760
I can't even...

1056
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,200
Google yummy pizza socks and see.

1057
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,100
No, no, you're fine.

1058
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,400
Is it like a popular...

1059
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,260
Yeah, yeah, but I can see the color of the sock.

1060
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,320
No, don't say the color.

1061
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,880
Because I narrowed it down.

1062
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,720
Yeah, exactly.

1063
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,060
It says yummy pizza, but you don't know the color of the sock.

1064
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,000
Stop saying what it says on there.

1065
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,520
Oh, my God.

1066
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,300
Look, today I'm wearing cat socks.

1067
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,220
It's a brown sock.

1068
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,120
Stop

1069
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,280
with the cat looks.

1070
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,760
I didn't say anything.

1071
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:20,000
If you look up cat socks, there's gonna be so many cat socks.

1072
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,940
I know.

1073
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,620
Oh, my God, someone said...

1074
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,500
Stop blowing your nose.

1075
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,720
Someone said, I have those same exact socks.

1076
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:30,940
Sure does.

1077
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:31,700
Post it on Twitter.

1078
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,040
And we won't tell you if it's the same socks.

1079
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,800
I'm just curious.

1080
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,220
Let's see.

1081
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,300
Let's get all my socks.

1082
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,760
I'm getting all my socks.

1083
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,880
Why are you getting all your socks?

1084
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,460
It's not like they're post-it sock pictures.

1085
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,660
Oh, my God, I have to show you my hat.

1086
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,980
But you can't explain this hat because it's actually one-of-a-kind hat.

1087
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,420
You're a little boy.

1088
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,640
You look like an elf.

1089
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:05,800
You look like a fucking elf.

1090
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,740
You don't think you have to do that, Dad.

1091
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,800
You have to do that in one of our parts.

1092
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,140
You have to do it in that group dance we're practicing tomorrow.

1093
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:14,900
Okay.

1094
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,040
You know that one, the short one?

1095
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,080
Yes, you have to do the exact dance.

1096
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,140
I don't know.

1097
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,940
Why not?

1098
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,800
I don't want the world.

1099
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,240
The world's not ready for...

1100
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,620
The world's not ready for that?

1101
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,000
Yeah.

1102
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,940
You look like a little fucking elf.

1103
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:31,460
I did?

1104
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,560
Not in a good way.

1105
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,980
What do you mean not in a good way?

1106
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,620
I love my little elf.

1107
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,840
Not in a good way.

1108
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,100
That, like, narrowed it down.

1109
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:46,960
Yeah.

1110
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,420
Mint hated one of my songs.

1111
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,200
Oh, yeah.

1112
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,200
She's a hater.

1113
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,480
I'm a hater.

1114
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:56,320
She's a hater.

1115
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,400
No, she hated two of my songs.

1116
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,180
Yeah.

1117
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,960
And one of them she has to sing in it, too.

1118
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,920
Oh, we did decide that, didn't we?

1119
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,080
You can't say that one word.

1120
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,980
Oh, wow, someone's showing their socks.

1121
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,240
Look at these little doggie socks.

1122
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,340
Oh, that's cute.

1123
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,500
He doxxes himself.

1124
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,520
He doxxed yourself, Shutterdog.

1125
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,640
He doxxed yourself.

1126
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,540
We're gonna find you.

1127
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,060
I'm gonna get those same doggie socks.

1128
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,780
I think I've looked at all the ankles now.

1129
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,900
Someone I got once a package.

1130
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,400
Oh, was it a package?

1131
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,560
Retweet, dude.

1132
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:40,820
But it was someone made Wisp socks.

1133
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,560
Oh, that's cute.

1134
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,880
I'm gonna make socks.

1135
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:44,680
Yeah.

1136
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,120
When I fix all my issues.

1137
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:47,880
Yeah.

1138
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,500
You're socks-ing yourselves.

1139
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,940
Yeah, socks yourself now.

1140
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,380
Socks yourself, everybody.

1141
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,480
Socks yourself.

1142
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,460
Sounds like suck yourself.

1143
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:57,440
Ew.

1144
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:58,800
What?

1145
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,260
Socks suck.

1146
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,100
Socks suck.

1147
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,300
Socks sucking yourselves.

1148
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,400
Socks sucking yourself.

1149
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:07,700
Socks sucking sex self.

1150
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:08,940
We're not okay.

1151
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,440
We're not okay anymore.

1152
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,260
Oh, yeah.

1153
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,540
I'm gonna tell me what hikikomori is.

1154
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,060
Oh, yeah.

1155
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,600
Did you post your score?

1156
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,500
No, I didn't post it.

1157
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,380
I just took the test.

1158
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,980
Because everybody's been doing that hikikomori test.

1159
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,140
I didn't know what that meant.

1160
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,680
Yeah, Doki didn't know what hikikomori meant.

1161
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,120
Her score was apparently really high.

1162
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,640
No, I've seen way higher.

1163
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,400
You have to take it and see what yours is.

1164
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,060
My score has to be really high.

1165
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:35,840
I don't go outside.

1166
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:36,380
I know.

1167
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,560
I don't go outside except for like this week.

1168
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:40,660
Yeah.

1169
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:44,440
Yeah, but I'm like, you go outside so much.

1170
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,720
Only for idols.

1171
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,360
I told you.

1172
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:46,800
Yeah, yeah.

1173
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:46,980
Okay.

1174
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,860
She said that and I was like, you talk to him.

1175
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,200
And she's like, that's not the same.

1176
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,100
They're divine beings.

1177
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:51,740
Exactly.

1178
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:53,660
Exactly.

1179
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,860
Talking to an idol is not talking to a normal person.

1180
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,600
They are a heavenly being.

1181
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,500
And so, therefore, I'm like talking to a deity is not talking to a normal person.

1182
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:08,140
And they're like, so true because we're talking to you too.

1183
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,900
What was my score?

1184
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,360
My score was like 70.

1185
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:12,420
78.

1186
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,260
I didn't say 78.

1187
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:14,940
You did.

1188
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,740
You said 78.

1189
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:19,240
Someone posted your shoes for some reason.

1190
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,140
Retro doofy shoes.

1191
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:24,540
Oh, yeah.

1192
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,520
They're all socks.

1193
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:27,160
Oh, yeah.

1194
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:27,680
Oh, my gosh.

1195
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,420
I like the astronaut one so much.

1196
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,700
I want those.

1197
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,120
Thanks for... Oh, my God.

1198
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,100
They have like eggs and bacon.

1199
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:39,380
Ew.

1200
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,600
Someone showed their feet.

1201
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:41,820
Ben.

1202
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:42,520
Ben.

1203
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:42,960
Ben.

1204
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:43,800
Ben.

1205
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:44,200
Ben.

1206
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:44,540
Ben.

1207
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:44,700
Ben.

1208
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,500
Wait, can I see?

1209
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,340
Their feet?

1210
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,260
No, I wanna see like what they post.

1211
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,480
It's literally just feet.

1212
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,240
It's their feet!

1213
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,160
Okay, never mind.

1214
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:52,900
Okay, freak.

1215
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,800
No, I thought there would be more context.

1216
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:02,490
I thought there would be more context.

1217
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:05,810
And I think a bunch of people's scores are pretty high.

1218
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:10,290
I think we're all just, you know, a little special.

1219
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:15,090
Alright?

1220
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,410
Let me go in my room.

1221
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:22,170
No.

1222
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:24,190
We have to practice!

1223
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:27,450
What the fuck?

1224
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:42,690
How are we supposed to practice if we don't- How are we supposed to practice if we don't- How are we supposed to practice if we don't-

1225
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,330
Oh my god.

1226
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:49,710
Oh my god.

1227
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:55,850
How long has this Twitter space been going?

1228
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:58,630
I don't know.

1229
00:50:58,690 --> 00:50:59,850
We finished signing this thing.

1230
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:05,090
I just retweeted it like 10 minutes ago.

1231
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:09,430
You could've reminded me.

1232
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:10,630
You could've said something.

1233
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:13,690
I don't know stuff about Twitter spaces.

1234
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:14,710
I don't do them.

1235
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:18,370
I think I've done it once when I was getting my wisdom- when I got my wisdom teeth removed.

1236
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,230
Oh, I like these socks too.

1237
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,170
The cats with the little leaves.

1238
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:25,050
They're like Canadian cats.

1239
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:29,430
Why can't you believe that?

1240
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:30,310
Of course!

1241
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:35,110
Of course I care about my dragons more than- more than men cares.

1242
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:37,010
Yeah, I hate wisps.

1243
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,010
I hate you guys.

1244
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:39,830
I hate you guys.

1245
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,750
You have a problem.

1246
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:48,450
You have a problem.

1247
00:51:52,590 --> 00:52:02,510
I would say this- this, like, relationship you have is like- is not healthy.

1248
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:04,630
What are you, my therapist?

1249
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:07,650
I don't need- I hate you guys.

1250
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:11,570
You can't even do it right.

1251
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:13,090
Too much hot and cold.

1252
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,550
You gotta have a balance.

1253
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:16,210
Call me Katy Perry.

1254
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,940
We're quiet because we're- Tired.

1255
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,400
What are we even talking about?

1256
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,220
I don't know.

1257
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,300
Like, it wasn't even supposed to be a podcast.

1258
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:56,960
It was supposed to be just us trying to get through- get through the- I'm too tired.

1259
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,580
Please, we have to- Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1260
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,780
You're slapping- you're slapping my knee.

1261
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,920
Ow, she's abusing me.

1262
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,520
We're gonna slap you.

1263
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,220
Guys, help.

1264
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,480
I'm being held against my will.

1265
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,360
Guys, I slapped your ass today.

1266
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,460
Whoa, okay.

1267
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,740
I said that and you were like, that's not true.

1268
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,100
Wait, you did win.

1269
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,380
I thought I told someone and you were like, that's not true.

1270
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,280
No, you didn't say shit.

1271
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,940
You didn't say anything.

1272
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,460
Okay.

1273
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,380
Okay, you better not do it again.

1274
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:42,740
Anyway, that wasn't true.

1275
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,180
You better not do it again.

1276
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:44,720
Anyway, that wasn't true.

1277
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:45,280
I lied.

1278
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,000
I just wanted to know what chat's gonna say.

1279
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:47,660
Okay.

1280
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,140
Why are you so weird?

1281
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:58,740
Why are you so- Why is that weird?

1282
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,300
I was just saying, I just wanted to see chat's reaction.

1283
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,460
I didn't slap her ass, I just- I just wanted to see your reaction.

1284
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:08,300
Okay.

1285
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,200
Why did you-

1286
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:17,020
I don't even want to look at their reactions.

1287
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,560
This is like not even- Is this even content, you guys?

1288
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,520
Guys, I think like dumb girls doing dumb things is always content.

1289
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,620
That's true.

1290
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,300
Yeah.

1291
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,320
Or dummy dumbs.

1292
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,140
They're so dumb.

1293
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,860
People are posting more of their socks.

1294
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,940
I like the space ones.

1295
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,640
Yeah, I like the space ones.

1296
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,860
Guys, if you're gonna post your socks, we're gonna make a hashtag.

1297
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,400
There's no Pluto on these socks!

1298
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,660
Okay, guys.

1299
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,560
Okay, I'm gonna check if this is a real hashtag.

1300
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,340
Alright.

1301
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,780
Is socks yourself a hashtag already?

1302
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,460
Guys, if you're gonna post your socks, can you post it in the socks yourself hashtag?

1303
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,000
Is it 1X or 2?

1304
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:17,380
It's S-O-C-K-S yourself.

1305
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:18,980
Socks yourself.

1306
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,260
It sounds like a threat.

1307
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,760
Post it in the socks yourself hashtag.

1308
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:28,860
Yeah, I know.

1309
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,840
I think it should be like S-O-X-X.

1310
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,460
S-O-X-X?

1311
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:34,740
Socks?

1312
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,280
Like docs, but socks.

1313
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,260
Oh, look at these!

1314
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,900
Wait, those look like my Wisp ones.

1315
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,200
I wonder if they're the same person.

1316
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,980
Okay, socks yourself.

1317
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,700
Hashtag socks yourself, everybody.

1318
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,200
We'd like to see your socks.

1319
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,100
Okay, S-O-X-S-O-X yourself.

1320
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,820
That's not a claimed hashtag, by the way.

1321
00:55:58,980 --> 00:55:59,680
What, S-O-X?

1322
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:00,680
Yeah, S-O-X yourself.

1323
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:01,700
It's not claimed?

1324
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,120
No, it's not claimed.

1325
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:04,860
Oh, I thought you said clean.

1326
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:05,580
No, no, no.

1327
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,300
Okay, guys.

1328
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,600
Alright, it's S-O-X yourself.

1329
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,080
S-O-X yourself.

1330
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,000
Yeah, that's our hashtag.

1331
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:12,980
S-O-X yourself.

1332
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,040
Make that trend, guys.

1333
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,060
Here, I'll type it.

1334
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:20,760
Okay, S-O, and then you can post a sock that you don't care about.

1335
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,680
No, I care about all my socks.

1336
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,380
Oh my god, just do a cheap sock.

1337
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,380
So we can have, like, context.

1338
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,660
None of my socks are cute because I just wear, like, sports socks.

1339
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,140
I literally am wearing a Nike sock right now.

1340
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,420
These ones match the pants I was wearing earlier.

1341
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:52,100
Oh my god, literally all my socks that I brought were literally Adidas and Nike socks.

1342
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,180
This one is, like, just cute.

1343
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,280
It has, like, a little moon on it.

1344
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,400
It looks like Nike.

1345
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,020
And then it has, like, little frills, and then this one has frills.

1346
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,440
Ooh, that's cute.

1347
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:03,900
Yeah.

1348
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,100
This one looks like the most generic that you can post on Twitter.

1349
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,960
Why are they so often, though?

1350
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,980
No one's gonna see the top part.

1351
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,400
They're just blue socks.

1352
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,740
That's why they're generic.

1353
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,120
That's why you get socks yourself.

1354
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,780
Oh my god, she's telling me to socks myself.

1355
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,480
Socks yourself now.

1356
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,560
I have more over there, more socks over there.

1357
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,820
Oh my god, people are socksing!

1358
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,820
Check the tag!

1359
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:30,460
Check the tag!

1360
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:31,740
People are socksing themselves!

1361
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,720
Oh my god!

1362
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:42,160
All I'm saying is that we're enabling people right now.

1363
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,420
Oh, these are pretty generic.

1364
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,220
Oh my god, yeah, yeah, yeah, socks yourself there.

1365
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,920
They're cute, they're like my wintry socks.

1366
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,840
Yeah, take a picture of that.

1367
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:56,360
Oh my god.

1368
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,640
What other socks do we have?

1369
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,840
Oh my god, someone has...

1370
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,420
Oh my god, I love her.

1371
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,280
This is so funny.

1372
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,400
Oh my god!

1373
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,900
These are all my dirty socks.

1374
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:17,800
Look at these cats.

1375
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,440
It's like an ultra-realistic cat on my sock.

1376
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,400
It's a black sock.

1377
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:23,980
Stop!

1378
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:31,550
She's not going to wear these out!

1379
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:33,550
So many black socks!

1380
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:36,430
It's not like they'll actually figure it out.

1381
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:37,650
They're crazy.

1382
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:38,550
I don't know, it's crazy.

1383
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:40,190
Oh, these are cute.

1384
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,210
I like these.

1385
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:43,510
What is that?

1386
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:44,910
Oh, the dinosaur ones!

1387
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:46,230
Why do they look like they're for babies?

1388
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:47,910
How small is your foot?

1389
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:50,970
I guess that's the size of your feet.

1390
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,250
Oh, these are hand-dyed.

1391
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:00,370
Wait, that's a glove.

1392
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,590
It's a cinnamoroll glove.

1393
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:04,510
I'm not showing anyone my feet.

1394
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:06,070
Look at my gloves, though.

1395
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:12,170
Someone literally just posted their white, normal socks.

1396
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:14,330
It's like their grandpa socks.

1397
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:17,050
Represent.

1398
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:18,730
You don't need cute socks.

1399
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,770
Oh my god, Mountain Dew Baja Blast socks.

1400
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:23,330
Whoa, wait, what?

1401
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:27,130
Yeah, they were right above the dino baby socks.

1402
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:28,110
Wait, I didn't see that.

1403
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:30,990
Dino DNA socks, those are cool.

1404
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:31,730
I like that.

1405
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:33,050
Santa socks.

1406
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,230
The calico ones are so cute!

1407
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:36,690
Oh, I see the Mountain Dew, yeah.

1408
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:40,110
Count Chocula socks with Count Chocula Crocs?

1409
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:42,570
Wow.

1410
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:47,250
That guy is getting all the ladies.

1411
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:49,530
Tia, what the hell, girl?

1412
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:52,130
Or that girl, who's getting all the ladies.

1413
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,290
Whatever, whatever ladies you want.

1414
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:56,390
The Bluey socks.

1415
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:59,290
I don't think that's their socks, they literally just googled Bluey.

1416
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:02,370
That's like, not even actual...

1417
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:03,650
I'm gonna buy them myself, then.

1418
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:04,770
Bluey?

1419
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:05,930
I like Bluey.

1420
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:07,090
I heard Bluey is really good.

1421
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:11,170
I heard Bluey, the reason why their colors are like that, is that even dogs can...

1422
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:13,310
Yeah, so dogs can...

1423
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:15,050
Can watch it, too.

1424
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,490
Yeah, it's good for dogs.

1425
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:17,250
Yeah.

1426
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,890
Wait, this person has the exact same socks as you.

1427
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:21,030
Where?

1428
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:21,710
I'm joking.

1429
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:22,030
Oh.

1430
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:27,490
I was more curious, I was gonna be like, wow, how?

1431
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:32,730
And then Tia would be like, oh my god, is that actually...

1432
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:35,830
I go to sock stores in Japan and buy all my socks there.

1433
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:36,410
Yeah.

1434
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:40,350
Oh, that's cute, look, there's like, sushi socks.

1435
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:42,470
That's actual sushi.

1436
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:43,690
No, it's not.

1437
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:45,890
Oh, those are socks!

1438
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:49,770
I'm like, she said that and I zoomed in.

1439
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:52,930
I'm like, it has to be for her.

1440
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,170
Oh, I like the ocean socks.

1441
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:57,330
Oh, you got them at the aquarium.

1442
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:58,930
Why is it pizza and turtle?

1443
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:00,630
Oh, it's a...

1444
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:02,830
It's a Ninja Turtles.

1445
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,030
Has been hotel socks?

1446
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:07,930
There's so many socks in here.

1447
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:09,910
You guys are actually doing this, thanks.

1448
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:11,630
Keeps your socks to yourself.

1449
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:12,930
Yeah.

1450
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:15,590
See, you were like, judging my hashtag.

1451
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:17,290
No, I am just...

1452
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:17,510
Yes, you were.

1453
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:18,830
You were judging my hashtag.

1454
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:20,310
It was such a cute hashtag.

1455
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:22,130
Gabbie, I like your socks.

1456
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:24,150
Thanks for everybody for socksing yourself.

1457
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:27,130
Oh, I like the Donkey Kong barrels.

1458
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,390
This is our... this is what you do in our podcast.

1459
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:36,910
Oh my god, look at these sloths, but they're like, dabbing sloths.

1460
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:39,690
It's kind of horrible.

1461
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:44,510
Oh, I like the alien ones.

1462
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:46,890
What is it, three for two?

1463
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,530
I like how they're from H&M.

1464
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:51,030
I know, what is happening?

1465
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:53,890
That's three for two.

1466
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:59,050
My oceans really got me to post my feed.

1467
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:01,750
We just want the socks, you don't have to include the feed.

1468
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:05,390
You can take it off your shoe.

1469
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:09,850
We didn't ask for the feed, we just wanted the socks.

1470
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:13,090
You did that yourself.

1471
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:16,270
Take off the socks before you show it.

1472
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:19,470
I think this person put their socks on their dog.

1473
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,450
Like, that's not their foot, right?

1474
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:24,170
There's no way that's hair.

1475
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:25,630
That's really hair.

1476
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:27,550
What if they have a really hairy leg?

1477
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:31,530
Is that on your dog, the Mintara ones?

1478
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:32,570
Plant Man?

1479
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:34,910
No, that's on the dog.

1480
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:36,570
Is that your leg?

1481
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,750
No, that's... there's no way.

1482
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:41,950
Oh my god, the Metal Gear socks!

1483
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:43,550
Mine came in while I was gone.

1484
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:46,290
Stop.

1485
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:48,070
These ones are so cute.

1486
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:49,990
These bear ones.

1487
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:51,750
Oh, they are in the...

1488
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,530
Oh, you just passed it right there, yeah.

1489
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,130
A little dog, Shiba Dog.

1490
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:58,370
Mug Buddy.

1491
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:59,870

1496
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:14,590
Andy, at home, I like your matcha.

1497
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,450
CJ, what are your Scooby Doo socks?

1498
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:17,770
CJ, I like your Scooby Doos.

1499
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:22,570
My phone is starting to get really hot.

1500
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:25,430
Alright, guys, thank you for socksing yourself.

01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:26,870

Wait.

Your socks are cute.

1509
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:43,010
Manthy Rose, Manthy.

We like your socks.

1513
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:50,650
Radius, I like your socks.

1514
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:51,930
It says horny for pizza.

1515
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:55,270
Hey, it matches yummy pizza.

1516
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:56,190
Yummy pizza.

1517
01:03:57,970 --> 01:04:01,790
One of us is feeling a little freaky for pizza, though.

1518
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:04,530
Oh my god, it's Hello Kitty Gundam socks.

1519
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:07,310
Kida, we like your socks.

1520
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:09,010
Yeah, Kida, we like your socks.

1521
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:11,830
We didn't get our socks look like...

1522
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:14,590
Nova, I don't know if I like your socks.

1523
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:19,390
Okay, I think, look at this, there's Stitch, but Stitch looks like a, look, it looks like a tentacle.

1524
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:21,010
Oh, wait, wait, it's like those hand socks.

1525
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:21,930
Like an octopus.

1526
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:25,330
It's those hand socks where the toes are like...

1527
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:26,410
The split toes.

1528
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:31,570
Yeah, yeah, you know like those, okay, you know like those shoes that look like feet?

1529
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:35,630
Oh, wait, okay, what?

1530
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:39,570
Those shoes that look like feet.

1531
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:41,690
I mean, I hope so.

1532
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:45,190
No, no, because you know, okay, it's like, they're so ugly.

1533
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:52,570
Because like, the whole goal is that it, this one, this one, you know these shoes?

1534
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:55,470
You know, like, I don't know what they're called.

1535
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:56,250
They're like...

1536
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:58,010
They have like, they look very toed.

1537
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:01,450
Yeah, yeah, they're like, they're like, something like this.

1538
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,490
Like, toe shoes.

1539
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:04,430
Oh, they're toe shoes.

1540
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:10,690
They're apparently healthier because they simulate, like, simulate like walking barefoot on grass and stuff like that.

1541
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:12,390
Because like, walking barefoot is apparently healthier.

1542
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:13,390
Yeah, I've heard that.

1543
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:15,130
Yeah, but I like, they're so fucking ugly.

1544
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:18,370
And I remember in university, I'd see some, one guy, like, would always wear them.

1545
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:19,070
And I'm like, you're such a...

1546
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:23,350
There's like a Nike shoes that actually are like, they're not, they're like split toed.

1547
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:23,870
Oh.

1548
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:25,230
They look kinda cute though.

1549
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:26,370
Let me see if I can find them.

1550
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:27,210
Like, Nike.

1551
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:32,450
I'm sorry if you wear toe shoes, guys, but like, not in public, please.

1552
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:34,250
Where I can see them.

1553
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:40,290
As long as it's not in public, where I can see them, I'm fine.

1554
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:45,590
You know what, Neppers, I like your socks, because like, those are very similar to the socks I wear.

1555
01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:46,510
Like, do you like these?

1556
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:49,470
They look like goat shoes.

1557
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:50,770
Yeah, I kinda like them though.

1558
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:52,410
I want people to think I'm a goat.

1559
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:54,270
Yeah, like, renaissance fair shit.

1560
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:56,670
I want people to think I'm a goat.

1561
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:57,450
I'm the goat.

1562
01:05:57,450 --> 01:06:00,450
I like how somebody put like...

1563
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:03,550
You guys, when you get your...

1564
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:05,570
Oh, that's cute though.

1565
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:06,090
Yeah, see?

1566
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:10,450
Guys, if you get your mint puppet, put it in a sock like this, like June did.

1567
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:16,090
I have the creature with me.

1568
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:20,090
Put your mint dolls in a sock.

1569
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:21,670
Don't cute Grease, she's kinda fat.

1570
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:27,790
Yeah, like the mint puppet is like, so...

1571
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:32,750
Like, I grabbed onto the mint puppet, and it was like, rock solid.

1572
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:36,890
I told them to put less stuff in.

1573
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:39,430
It was like, rock solid puppet.

1574
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:43,950
I was like, what the fuck is wrong with this puppet?

1575
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:46,030
It's not a puppet, it's a doll.

1576
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:49,450
Like, literally, I couldn't even squeeze it.

1577
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:50,890
That's how hard...

1578
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:52,890
I told them to put less stuff in.

1579
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:57,530
I wanted to like, chuck it, because it felt like a rock.

1580
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:00,570
Well, that's actually, maybe that's better then.

1581
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:02,050
If it's kind of more stiff.

1582
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:03,770
Better for chucking.

1583
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,970
Better for throwing the puppet.

1584
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:07,270
Not a puppet, the doll.

1585
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:08,990
God damn it, you have me saying puppet now.

1586
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:12,830
Alright guys, I'm tired now.

1587
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:13,610
Yeah, me too.

1588
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:14,350
I'm tired.

1589
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:15,030
Okay.

1590
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:17,130
Alright guys, we're gonna practice.

1591
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:18,430
Are we?

1592
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:20,230
What do we do in the morning?

1593
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:21,810
Before brekkie?

1594
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:22,930
Yeah, before brekkie.

1595
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:25,230
So we should get up early then, and we go to bed now.

1596
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:28,010
Guys, I might not be able to stream rest, guys, I'm really tired.

1597
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:33,650
We shouldn't have done the Twitter space, we should have practiced.

1598
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:38,250
You said, you said, I said, no we shouldn't, you're like, I'm gonna do the space.

1599
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:39,690
No, you did not say that.

1600
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:42,870
I was like, I'm gonna do a Twitter space, and you were like, okay.

1601
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:45,030
You literally were just like, okay.

1602
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:48,550
I was like, should we though, should we?

1603
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:49,790
You didn't even say that.

1604
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:51,830
Shut the hell up, you liar.

1605
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:54,530
No, I was trying to be a responsible person.

1606
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:58,310
You were signing forever, I was like, well, while we wait, I'll do the Twitter space.

1607
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:01,730
I was literally faster before the Twitter space because we kept arguing.

1608
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:04,030
Oh, we got a good idea.

1609
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:06,810
It was a good content idea.

1610
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:07,250
Yeah.

1611
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:07,990
Okay.

1612
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:10,090
Thanks guys for joining us.

1613
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:11,270
Bye guys.

1614
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:12,450
We're tired, tired, tired.

1615
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:14,890
We might have the op collab tomorrow.

1616
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:21,070
Tomorrow, depends on how fucked up we feel tomorrow, but.

1617
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:22,770
That's the only time we can do it.

1618
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:23,950
That's so true.

1619
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:25,410
And it's not so true.

1620
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:26,030
If we.

1621
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:29,410
It'll be tomorrow night, because morning, morning.

1622
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:30,310
We can't.

1623
01:08:30,370 --> 01:08:31,430
Yeah, tomorrow night.

1624
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:34,310
Even if it's just a short one, we could just do a short something.

1625
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:35,610
Yeah, we'll do something short.

1626
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:38,570
But this kind of is like a Twitter stream too.

1627
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:42,790
Not a lot of people use Twitter.

1628
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:43,250
True.

1629
01:08:44,610 --> 01:08:45,070
True.

1630
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:46,810
Okay, guys.

1631
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:48,570
Good night.

1632
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:50,270
Bye bye.

1633
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:52,550
Bye bye.

1634
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:53,150
Say bye.

1635
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:53,650
Bye.

1636
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:55,870
I'm tired.

1637
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:57,990
Thanks you for socksing yourself.

1638
01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:59,990
Thanks for socksing yourselves for us.

1639
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:04,790
Thank you for socksing yourself and seeing our other socks.

1640
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:08,490
We really liked looking at the cute ones.

1641
01:09:08,490 --> 01:09:09,030
Yeah.

1642
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:13,310
And thank you for not putting your feet in it too and making it weird.

1643
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:20,480
Okay, we're gonna go to bed.

1644
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:21,900
Good night, everybody.

1645
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:22,620
Good night.

1646
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:23,700
Wait, hold on.

1647
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:27,200
I'm seeing if anybody's saying good night to us.

1648
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,480
Who said good night?

1649
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:30,580
Minto and Doki.

1650
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:31,920
Good night.

1651
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:37,880
Bye bye, Minto and Doki.

1652
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:39,280
Doki and Minto.

1653
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,240
Shut up.

1654
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,740
I want Doki and Minto.

1655
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:46,440
Someone...

1656
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:46,880
Okay, fine.

1657
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,180
Next, you said Doki and Mint.

1658
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:48,600
God.

1659
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:51,400
Yeah, bye bye, Doki and Mint.

1660
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:51,980
Oh, thank you.

1661
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,120
I knew you were a real one.

1662
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:55,000
I knew.

1663
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:57,640
I'm shutting this off.

1664
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:58,560
Bye.

1665
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:01,840
And...
