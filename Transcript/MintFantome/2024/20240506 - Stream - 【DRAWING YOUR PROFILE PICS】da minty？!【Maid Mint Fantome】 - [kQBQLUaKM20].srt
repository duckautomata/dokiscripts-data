people would fill out and submit their usernames and um and

uh a request um i might i'll be honest i'm probably not
gonna remember what your pro or know what your profile

110
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:53,720

is me and my big head like this oh my god there's

111
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:04,280

117
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:29,120
i'm still scrolling one in one thousand three hundred and
fifty four chance

118
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,080
It's better than gotcha odds, everybody.

119
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,060
So, um, yep, I'm on the screen.

120
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,280
That's your name.

121
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,940
Right there.

122
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,200
Maybe.

123
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,340
Probably.

124
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,080
But yeah, so I'll pick the wheel.

125
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,300
I'll pick someone from the wheel.

126
00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:00,920
And that way it's very, it's fair, um, you know, and anybody
has a chance to get a profile picture.

127
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,700
I put in a little thing saying like, Hey, do you have a
request?

128
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,940

I know, you won't see it until the name is pulled.

238
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,240
Because I'll be honest.

239

sunglasses.

248
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,040
Oh wait, no, sorry, that's just turtle.

249
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,860
Turtles, I'm sorry, I think this is different because
there's turtle and then there's turtles.

250
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,840
And you're turtles.

251
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,960
You asked for a turtle.

252
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,140
Turtle doesn't sound like a real word anymore.

253
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,340
That's not me.

254
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,660
I'm sorry, so close.

255
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,840
You could steal it if you wanted to.

256
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,500
But it's gonna have sunglasses, you know.

257
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,080
Hope you had a good day because I had an interesting one.

258
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,980
Three black bears decided to camp my house and not let me
leave for five hours.

259
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,610
Did they stand like this?

260
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,490
Did they stand like kind of all...

261
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,470
Bears standing?

262
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:30,870
Can I pet

263
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,700
that dog?

264
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,400
No, it's not a dog.

265
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:11,010
It really is a bear standing dog.

266
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,900
What are we drawing right now?

267
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,580
A turtle!

268
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,220
We're drawing a turtle with sunglasses.

269
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,100
I'm gonna make him really cool though, I'm gonna make him
cool.

270
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,320
Ouch!

271
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,140
Ouch!

272
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,160
Oh gosh, I think I have a pinched nerve in my neck and I
haven't been able to like...

273
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,240
Turn my head to the side all week.

274
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,520
So it hurts to laugh.

275
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,520
Oh gosh!

276
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,840
Oh, okay.

277
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,920
Oh, okay.

278
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,900
You would think that, like...

279
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,420
Horror, horror, horror.

280
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,980
You would think that being a ghost, like, you don't have to
deal with so many things.

281
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,720
But you know what?

282
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,940
It was so sad when I died, and I was like, yeah, I'm a
ghost.

283
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,840
I've escaped everything from the human shackles.

284
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,840
And they were like, about that.

285
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,500
You have everything the same just as a ghost.

286
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,080
I got ghost taxes.

287
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,300
I've got ghost health problems.

288
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,260
Okay, so a turtle.

289
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,600
Gotta have a big old hump.

290
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,680
Like that.

291
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,820
Can we have the bear standing emoji in the next batch,
please?

292
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,580
I already deleted it.

293
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,080
The bears get a little cold.

294
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,540
organic.

295
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,440
That's not a bowler hat.

296
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:07,360
Because turtles have

297
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,090
like...

298
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:31,280
Like that!

299
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,520
That looks like a turtle so far.

300
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,760
Sunglasses.

301
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,630
And he's like, yeah.

302
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,470
And then he's got his little legs.

303
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:58,170
But this one, this one is giving a big old thumbs up.

304
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,510
And he has another little leg.

305
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,130
They have four legs.

306
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:08,730
Oh, wait.

307
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,770
Turtles have tails.

308
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,580
Why is he backwards in his shell?

309
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,240
What do you mean?

310
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,380
No, he's not.

311
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,580
Oh.

312
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,240
Turtle.

313
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:31,820
Turtle.

314
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,980
Oh, he only has three legs, you're right.

315
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,040
There we go.

316
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,180
Let's give him an extra one just for good measure.

317
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,300
And I'll even, you know what?

318
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,400
I'll even color it.

319
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,600
I'll even color it.

320
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,320
Let's give him a good old green.

321
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,490
There's a turtle.

322
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,830
Oh my god, Squidward!

323
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,010
Tortolini!

324
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:57,710
Thank you for the food!

325
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:58,790
Thank you!

326
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,930
Thank you so much!

327
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,250
Do you think I should have made him bigger or...

328
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,970
Do you think it's okay?

329
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,010
I can make him bigger.

330
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,090
Give me a second.

331
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,550
So you can see him more easily.

332
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,310
Um...

333
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,250

What's that saying?

337
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,230

Sorry, I don't know how to do like...

352
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:12,360

this go faster but I'm doing my best

353
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:27,030
good afternoon good afternoon good afternoon yeah some
people brought it up but yeah yesterday I was in the relay

354
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:35,550
and it was so much fun I was so nervous because I was just
like I have like the transitions and stuff between songs and

355
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:44,510
it was like me turning stuff on and making sure things were
running properly and I was like what if I mess up a thing

356
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:53,930
but overall it all worked out even though my voice was kind
of like there you go turtle

00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,220
All right, we got scuffed Bochi.

00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,980

431
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,140
Bochi the Rock.

433
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,720
Let's see, let's see, let's see.

434
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,320
Okay, this is a good picture.

435
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,000
Right here.

436
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,780
No, this picture.

437
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:55,400
Okay.

438
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,340
Scuffed Bochi wearing vans.

439
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,160
I like it, I like it, I like it.

440
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,920
Alright, we're in my...

441
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,640
We're in my...

442
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,220
Okay, Bochi time.

443
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,440
Let's see.

444
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,720
To draw Bochi.

445
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,900
I think I'm...

446
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,760
Okay, Bochi has those little hair bongles.

447
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,580
I'm gonna give her a square head like her hair bongle,
right?

448
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,500
One thing I really like about Bochi too is when her eyes
kind of like do this.

449
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,620
Like that, you know?

450
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,540
And then...

451
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,120
What kind of pose should she have?

452
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,120
Oh, one that's like really cool, maybe.

453
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,300
Because she's wearing vans.

454
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,280
Those aren't Yoda's.

455
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,840
Those are her hands.

456
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,000
Right?

457
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,560
And...

458
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,840
She's got the vans.

459
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,140
She's got the vans.

460
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,640
She's got the vans.

461
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,240
How do I draw vans?

462
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,640
Hold on.

463
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,920
I'm not feeling it.

464
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,380
We'll start.

465
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,080
Hold on.

466
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,740
Was that the Phantom of the Opera?

467
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,340
Yeah.

468
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:18,920
Yeah.

469
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,080
I was the Phantom of the Opera.

470
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,900
Hold on.

471
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,660
Now I need a picture of vans.

472
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,100
Van shoes.

473
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,340
Oh, well give her the checkered ones.

474
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,820
Aren't those really popular?

475
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,420
Oh wait, no, there's a low...

476
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,200
Wait, huh?

477
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,100
Everyone always wears those checkered vans, right?

478
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,380
Checkered.

479
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,940
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

480
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,440
Yeah.

481
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,900
Hey, Mint, my friend Liz is having her birthday this week.

482
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,320
May I have a happy birthday to give to her?

483
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,560
heard from you?

484
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:04,540
Sure.

485
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,720
Hey, Liz.

486
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,540
I heard from your friends.

487
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,020
I win.

488
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,960
That is your birthday this week.

489
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,680
Happy birthday.

490
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,500
I hope you have the bestest birthday ever and not all your
dreams come true.

491
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,320
Ignore the person on the screen.

492
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,660
Birthday.

493
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,580
Happy.

494
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,520
Happy birthday.

495
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,020
Happy birthday to you, Liz!

496
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,180
I'm not trying to erase the birthday or anything, you know?

497
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,620
I'm just, uh, okay.

498
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,660
All right.

499
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,020
Bochi the Rock.

500
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:54,500
She's got, she's got her, um, her big sweater on.

501
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:01,120
And, uh, actually, let's have her, like, kind of, actually,
I think I know an idea for a pose.

502
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,320
Okay.

503
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:11,200
She's shrugging, she's like, why do I exist?

504
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:23,590
And then we'll give her a wide power stance so that she can
show off the vans.

505
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,670
I'll be like, why are you standing like that?

506
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,870
So you can notice my cool shoes.

507
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,070
And they're the checkered ones.

508
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,580
like that.

509
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:56,810
I gotta really fill these in to sell the effect, okay?

510
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,090
She's wearing her vans, everybody.

511
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,070
She's wearing her vans.

512
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:04,550
Okay.

513
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,150
Asserting dominance.

514
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,310
She's shrugging.

515
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,010
She says, why am I alive?

516
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,890
Oh, she's got her little skirt on.

517
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,290
Oh, wait, hold on.

518
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,990
to erase her middle.

519
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,710
She's got to have her skirt on, you guys.

520
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:35,850
She's not indecent.

521
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,410
That'd be disgusting.

522
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,550
She's not walking around with no pants on, okay?

523
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:45,970
Vance called.

524
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:49,290
They want you to stop leaking their new collab that they
commissioned from you.

525
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,150
That I didn't sign any NDA.

526
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,910
This is me reacting to that.

527
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,950
I didn't sign any NDA.

528
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,690
I don't know what you're talking about.

529
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,850
This might be actually a leak of the new season.

530
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,010
Not gonna lie.

531
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,650
This might be a leak of the new season, though.

532
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,390
Of Bochi the Rock.

533
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,490
Watch, like, an actual Vans Bochi collab comes out.

534
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,530
Wait, I got her hair color wrong.

535
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:24,930
No!

536
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,210
It's more light.

537
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:28,830
There we go.

538
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,070
There we go.

539
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,030
Hi Mint!

540
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:41,350
I was wondering why a cute ghost Mint kept appearing and I
recommended.

541
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,810
Realized that my Yoshi was back from the dead, kinda.

542
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:45,930
Glad to have you back, boss.

543
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,410
Thank you!

544
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,050
I'm back, baby.

545
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,710
I'm back.

546
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:57,210
Yeah.

547
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:02,830
Sometimes I wonder, I'm like, do people know I'm around?

548
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:07,930
I wonder if people know that I'm here.

549
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:10,050
And then we need a blue balls.

550
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,610
Oh wait, it's more aqua ball.

551
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,710
And a yellow ball.

552
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,870
We know.

553
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:25,090
Bochi the block.

554
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:26,810
Bochi the clock.

555
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,270
Bochi the rock.

556
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:28,650

00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,250

That's like a type of clothing, isn't it?

562
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:46,960

00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,880
I can't tell if I'm saying it right.

or actually YouTube username.

634
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,080

00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,800
Unless you comment, then I see the ads.

640
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,620
But it's usually different names.

641
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,120
Thanks for the gift, dude.

642
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,420

Well, someone asked earlier about, like, a spooky one.

00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:55,590
But I can't do a spooky one for them and also as the emote.

690
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:57,970
Let's see.

691
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:01,130

How do I want to do this?

696
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,240
I must confess that I requested, but the request is very
vague.

697
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,440
That's fine.

698
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,760
Now, some people didn't even request, so...

699
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,920
How do I want to do this?

700
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,000
Okay, there we go.

Tree frog tastes just like chicken, don't you know?

Okay What's wrong with me?

708
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:59,150
Concentration, okay?

709
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:18,970

00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,600
Does this even look like me anymore?

711
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,860
Does this even look like me anymore?

712
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:36,960
Hmm.

713
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,620
It's okay, once I do the hair, well...

714
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:44,960
Thank you!

715
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:45,900
Superliminal.

716
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,840
Ghost made is Moe, made of ectoplasm.

717
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,040
Oh, sorry, M-O-E.

718
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,980
I don't see the difference.

719
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,760
Oh, do I need a little tongue out?

720
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:54,260
Maybe.

721
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,900
Now I'm reaching...

722
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,740
Oh, whoops.

723
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:03,020
Redo.

724
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,420
I have to have that final stroke.

725
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:05,980
I didn't know what to have.

726
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,180
You meant by request, so I just asked you to have a nice
day.

727
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,340
If I get pulled, can I request it in Super Chat?

728
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:12,960
Of course!

729
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,200
You don't even have to super chat.

730
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,070
Remember when I said crop there?

731
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:25,190
I lied because I'm coming out of your screen.

732
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:29,450
Coming out of your screen.

733
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:32,610
Open up.

734
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:34,970
Yes, Johnny.

735
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:45,210

around and like she was just farting like crazy and even and

748
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:27,380

smelly And like they never brought that up when I was like

751
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:02,280
Like, when I was like, hey, is there anything I should know
about her?

752
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,400
No.

753
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:07,560
They didn't say anything like, oh, she's a smelly machine.

754
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,080
No.

755
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:10,840
They were just like, no, she's totally fine.

756
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:11,820
Everything's good.

757
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,440
And it's not like I was feeding her, like, new food at that
point.

758
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,480
It was still her old food.

759
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:25,180
She just was, maybe it's the food itself, maybe.

760
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:38,920
would you say they gaslighted you okay also a little bit
because when i got her like they were like oh my gosh you

761
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:47,340
just adopted the best cat ever she's so sweet she's so nice
she's so oh my gosh everything about her she's like this

762
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:54,760
wonderful purring from the other end better out than in i
always say

763
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,640
But, um...

764
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,360
Murphy, what the hell?

765
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,600
Oh, God.

766
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:46,970
Oh, God, okay.

767
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:49,590
Anyway, what was I saying?

768
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:51,970
Oh, they were like, she's so sweet.

769
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:53,130
She's a lap cat.

770
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:54,230
She does this.

771
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:55,630
She's just the sweetest girl ever.

772
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:56,450
And I was like, yippee!

773
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:58,890
I've always wanted a lap cat.

774
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:09,770
I was so excited She doesn't She is not laid in my lap Once
I think actually it was maybe False advertising I was like

775
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:21,550
what okay I was like Well you know she's She's still nervous
Like she'll get in my lap Eventually Not even once She

776
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:31,090
hasn't even laid in the bed with me When I'm going to sleep
I think I was like Like, why do you advertise her as the

777
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:32,210
ultimate lab cat?

778
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:33,390
And I mean, she's very sweet.

779
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:34,090
Don't get me wrong.

780
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:36,390
Like, she's so, so nice.

781
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:39,590
And, like, she, maybe it was lab cat.

782
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:42,870
It's probably better, probably.

783
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:46,390
She just lays in my lap and farts the whole time.

784
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:47,670
You want her farting?

785
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:50,370
I want her.

786
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:51,030
I want her.

787
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:59,290
Well, recently, she, if I'm on the couch, she has started,
like, um, she has started laying next to me so maybe it just

788
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:11,050
takes her a little bit of extra time or something I don't
know but um but yeah now it looks like me okay what was the

789
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:14,890
name by ginger works that's right

790
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:24,930
wait what the hell what happened to the hardness there we go
oh I did that

791
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:41,520
There you go.

792
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:44,600
So, hopefully.

793
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:56,900
And, like, for the first time last night, she, she, uh, did
not, oh, I forgot the, um, she did not sleep with me in my

794
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,560
bed, but she stayed in the room.

795
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,540
In my, in my room.

796
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,100
So, uh, you know.

797
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:10,280
She's eventually getting there, I think, a little bit.

798
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,080
I forgot my eyelashes.

799
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,860
I forgot how to have eyelashes.

800
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:24,460
Oops.

801
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:26,980
Oops.

802
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:32,440
Oh, and blushing.

803
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:43,640
There you go.

804
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,540
I had problems with my big nasty boy when I got him.

805
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,860
Crazy running, jumping, etc.

806
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,260
Turns out the rescue just copy and paste it.

807
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,900
Maybe they were afraid no one would want to poop or...

808
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,940
They were like crying, though, at the pet store.

809
01:03:59,080 --> 01:03:59,900
They were like...

810
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,780
They were like...

811
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:04,200
Oh my gosh, we're going to miss you, Paz.

812
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:05,440
Oh my god, what?

813
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,680
And I was like, wow, she's so beloved.

814
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:11,820
She's so sweet.

815
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,000
But, um...

816
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,760
I hope that they didn't just copy and paste it.

817
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:19,820
I hope not.

818
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:21,520
Welcome to membership.

819
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:22,340
Thank you!

820
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,220
Thank you!

821
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:26,880
Anyway.

822
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,280
Yeah, I hope not.

823
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:35,970
Okay, let's do another one.

824
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:43,450
Tears of joy to be rid of the sticky wood.

825
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:47,190
Crying because they can finally breathe.

826
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:52,880
The winner is...

827
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:56,290
Ta-da!

828
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:58,810
Venti does things!

829
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:01,330
Venti, come on down!

830
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:05,970
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop!

831
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:16,270
Make the watermelon extra round and perhaps give the cat a
cowboy hat if possible.

832
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:17,190
Thank you!

833
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:21,450
Well, I don't know what your profile picture is.

834
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:30,790
They weren't crying, their ears were, their eyes weren't
watering because they just cleaned her litter.

835
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:40,230
Okay, wait, we have no context for your picture, except that
there is a watermelon and a cat.

836
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:44,030
So hold on.

837
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:54,690
Make the watermelon extra round and give the cat a cowboy
hat if possible.

838
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:55,690

head out here.

He's happy to be there.

858
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:31,200
Do you think he needs the ears or...

859
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,660
I feel like I'm drawing something from Battle Cats.

860
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:43,000
Nah, I like it better like this.

861
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:43,740

I made him a little insane.

864
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:02,490
Yeah, whatever.

865
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:05,830
Nice.

866
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:08,490
Okay, so the watermelon is really chunky.

867
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:11,290
And then a cowboy hat is like...

868
01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:13,870
Tarnation.

869
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:15,510
Just like that.

870
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:20,550
Wait, how do I...

871
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:23,000
Actually, I don't know what a cowboy hat looks like at all.

872
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:24,910
Cowboy.

873
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:28,610
Cowboy hat.

874
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:30,700
Okay, hold on.

875
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:34,030
Oh, yep.

876
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:37,690
I'm getting some fine cowboys.

877
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:40,230
Whing.

878
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:45,010
I'm a cowboy.

879
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:48,030
I'm a cow.

880
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:50,150
Wait, there's cowboys, but where are the cow men?

01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:05,710
Hi, wisps, wisps, wisps.

887
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:09,750
It looks like a fedora.

888
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:15,810
It's okay, it's okay.

889
01:11:17,050 --> 01:11:20,530
I wonder if I do this, if I like have the ears kind of
sticking out.

890
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:34,630
here but I kind of look like him looking more like a potato

891
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:46,090
watermelon colors we needed like a dark we need like a not a

01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:31,560
orange cat i always hear that orange cats are crazy but i
had an orange cat when i was a kid and he wasn't that crazy

895
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:37,620
actually Okay, those should be good colors.

896
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,460
How am I supposed to do this, actually?

897
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,580
I did not think this through.

898
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,080
Did not think this through at all.

899
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,580
I did not think this through at all.

900
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,180
Mine is.

901
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:56,700
No, my orange cat was actually the most chill cat I have
ever had.

902
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,620
He was so chill.

903
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,260
He was so sweet.

904
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:02,280
But he did have a problem.

905
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,980
Like, I don't let my cats outside anymore.

906
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:22,460
when I you know my family before they didn't really care and
oh I didn't mean to zoom in there we go and and but he would

907
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:30,360
go to the neighbors houses and he would like walk he knew
how to open doors he was a very smart cat like if the door

908
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:41,320
had a handle he would open it up and so because of that he
would go to the neighbor's houses and let himself in.

909
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:49,080
And would just, like, the neighbors would sometimes call and
be like, wait, I'm such an idiot.

910
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:49,680
Hold on.

911
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:54,280
I'm just going to color in the whole thing and then we'll do
the other stripes.

912
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:55,800
Why am I...

913
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,320
Work smarter, not harder, everybody.

914
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,200
But, um...

915
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:05,720
See, I'm stupid.

916
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:06,680
I don't know how to do this.

917
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,520
But yeah.

918
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:17,560
And then, like, during dinner, he would just kind of sit at
the table.

919
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,700
And he wouldn't beg for food.

920
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:22,200
Like, he didn't try to climb on the table or anything.

921
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:25,100
Like, we would save him a seat at the dinner table.

922
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:26,060
Because he...

923
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:27,760
Ouch, it just bit my tongue.

924
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:34,280
Oh, I love it.

925
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:34,440
I love it.

926
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:39,960
Yeah,

927
01:14:46,410 --> 01:14:47,430
he was very polite.

928
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:51,410
I mean, there was one time he pooped in my bed when I was
sleeping.

929
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:56,530
But other than that, he was really respectful.

930
01:14:58,090 --> 01:14:59,270
And he was a good guy.

931
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,580
Yeah, I think that's when he was going senile.

932
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,460
He thought my bed was a litter box.

933
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:26,820
and I remember like I remember him like trying to you know
how when cats like like they like scoop with their paws I

934
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:32,880
thought he was trying to get comfy I was like what are you
doing little guy and then he turned around just take took a

935
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:45,380
big old dupe over I was in my bed while I was I was like you
know uh honest mistake truly why is he wearing a snake hat

936
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,340
Snake that ate an elephant.

937
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:48,760
Wait, what?

938
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:49,860
What are you talking about?

939
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,520
That's not very polite.

940
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,480
Yeah, that part was not very polite.

941
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,360
That part kind of sucked.

942
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,020
I was like, why would you...

943
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:05,300
Why would you do that?

944
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,480
I think he was kind of losing it.

945
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:13,600
Oh no, you guys.

946
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,740
I don't know if I've ever told you guys about my grandma.

947
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,700
But I'm gonna go see her soon.

948
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,460
I'm going to go see my grandma soon.

949
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,380
I haven't seen her in a long while.

950
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,540
She might not even remember me.

951
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:31,280
But...

952
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:32,900
Um...

953
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:33,640
We'll see.

954
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:38,220
Can't believe Mint just docks yourself to be Johnny Depp.

955
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:38,940
What do you mean?

956
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:40,820
Wait, did he poop in a bed like that?

957
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:48,960
Whoa, who is this wow mustache man who replaced Mint?

958
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,120
What are you talking about?

959
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:50,940
about?

960
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:57,120
I'm the mysterious traveler.

961
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,420
I'm a mysterious artician.

962
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:06,460
Why is it so hard making this a watermelon?

963
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,540
Holy cow.

964

972
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:23,800
Oh.

973
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,240

01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:31,060

Maybe here.

978
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,620
Let's try again.

979
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:42,580
It doesn't work.

980
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,740
I can't use bucket.

981
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:45,700
It doesn't work.

982
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,620
It doesn't work.

983
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,900
I have to color it all in by hand.

984
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:51,820
I can't use bucket.

985
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,160
I can't.

986
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,780
I can't use bucket.

987
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,340
Brush size maybe.

988
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,140
No, it's okay.

989
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:04,500
You guys, calm down.

990
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:05,900
Why are you in such a rush, huh?

991
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,900
I like coloring in the lines.

992
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:12,560
I like it.

993
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:15,020
It's making me feel a little bit actually too relaxed.

994
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:26,620
a nap before the stream because i was like oh no i'm not i
am drinking coffee right now but i'm still so sleepy sleepy

995
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:42,060

997
01:19:56,530 --> 01:20:01,570
Tellamaya, y'all backseating, artisting, Picasso?

998
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:02,790
Yeah!

999
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:05,530
Stop backseating me!

1000
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:08,210
Stop it!

1001
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:09,310
You're mad.

1002
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:10,410
This is the process.

1003
01:20:10,970 --> 01:20:12,330
It must be done by hand.

1004
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:14,450
Or not at all.

1005
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:16,490
Actually, I wonder if I can book it here.

1006
01:20:19,730 --> 01:20:20,450
Yippee!

1007
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:21,770
Yippee!

1008
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:25,810
I mean...

1009
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:28,990
It can only, it can be done by buckets sometimes.

1010
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:37,010
Yay!

1011
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:42,250
Oh yes, the process.

1012
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:44,590
Screw the process.

1013
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:47,550
A little pink nose like that.

1014
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:51,430
And then...

1015
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:58,090
Give this, give this little cow cat a nice Brown fedora.

1016
01:20:58,890 --> 01:20:59,710
No, this is not a fedora.

1017
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:01,370
This is a cowboy hat.

1018
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:03,470
What kind of fedora would be brown?

1019
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:06,050
Thanks, Raymac.

1020
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:07,810
There will literally be a day.

1021
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:12,650
Oh, there will literally never be a day I complain about too
much Mint Metal Gear karaoke.

1022
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:13,630
Ah.

1023
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:15,310
I'm glad.

1024
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:17,690
Sorry, all the doughnuts are backed up.

1025
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:21,390
They're coming in eventually.

1026
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:23,790
That was from a while ago.

1027
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:25,090
Yeah.

1028
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:27,450
That's okay.

1029
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:28,890
I still saw it.

1030
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:34,150
Trying to get the color.

1031
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:35,830
Trying to get the perfect.

1032
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:38,790
This guy is a deputy.

1033
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:44,210
He is running this town.

1034
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:47,110
He is running this town.

1035
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:51,570
I hope you like it.

1036
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,230
I hope you like your...

1037
01:21:53,230 --> 01:21:53,890
Oh wait, sorry.

1038
01:21:54,710 --> 01:21:55,810
I have to write your name too.

1039
01:21:57,410 --> 01:21:59,070
Venti does things.

1040
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:00,490
But don't look that up.

1041
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:04,630
Apparently, Venti is doing things.

1042
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:22,500
But for the karaoke, it's funny because I said, like, I'm
not going to do a karaoke.

1043
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:24,700
Sorry, I'm like tilting my head when she does.

1044
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:26,480
Oh, gosh.

1045
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,320
Okay, this is so far so good.

1046
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,160
Oh, nice.

1047
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:43,180
I was like, oh, I'm not gonna do another karaoke for a while
because I, because I, my voice, my throat has not been so

1048
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:43,660
good.

1049
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:51,740
And then I realized that the date for, I mixed the date up
for this karaoke, and I was like, oopsie.

1050
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:58,120

But, um, I don't know why you would bring up that person.

1119
01:26:59,890 --> 01:27:01,230

01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:44,580
No notes.

1227
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:45,860
What an honor for them.

1228
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,720

01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:53,720
No, they didn't.

1230
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:55,060
They're not that fast.

01:37:59,200 --> 01:37:59,440

B closing parentheses!

1243
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:22,680
The reason in particular would you be preferred...

1244
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:24,940
Wait, would you prefer to be rounded up 5 foot?

1245
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:27,180
down to four foot.

1246
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:40,780
It doesn't, if something is over five, doesn't it mean you
put it at, you put it to the higher number.

1247
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:42,500
So five foot.

1248
01:39:47,050 --> 01:39:48,010
Five foot.

1249
01:39:49,010 --> 01:39:49,210
Me.

1250
01:39:51,470 --> 01:39:51,770
Me.

1251
01:39:52,630 --> 01:39:54,210
Be closing parentheses.

1252
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:57,670
Be close.

1253
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:57,890
Oh.

1256
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:10,230

1258
01:40:13,950 --> 01:40:15,950
I've got you.

1259
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:16,890
I've got you.

1260
01:40:16,990 --> 01:40:17,650
I got you.

1261
01:40:20,050 --> 01:40:21,670
Oh, my bad.

1262
01:40:22,330 --> 01:40:23,450
Goodbye wheel.

1263
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:24,030
Okay.

1264
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:31,780
Let's see.

1265
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:36,100
Me and the most cool, fly, fresh, awesome.

1266
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:37,480
I can do that.

1267
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:37,840
Hold on.

1268
01:40:37,940 --> 01:40:39,100
Look at these though.

1269
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:40,800
What?

1270
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:41,820
Wrong thing.

1271
01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:03,730
Oh.

1272
01:41:07,390 --> 01:41:08,210
Oh yeah.

1273
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:15,620
So close.

1274
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:16,600
Hold on.

1275
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:18,340
Maybe if I put them on my face.

1276
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,120
When I'm looking center.

1277
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:23,200
Wait, how do I get the mustache in front?

1278
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:24,380
Uh-oh.

1279
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:25,160
I think I just...

1280
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:25,740
Oh, my gosh.

1281
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:27,680
I can't move the mustache anymore.

1282
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:28,520
It's stuck forever.

1283
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:29,500
Wait.

1284
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:30,480
Uh-oh.

1285
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:32,020
Hold on.

1286
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:32,920
Um.

1287
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:35,000
Uh.

1288
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:39,120
I don't know how to get rid of the mustache.

1289
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:40,580
Uh-oh.

1290
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:42,780
I don't know how to move it.

1291
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:44,160
Wait, I wanted to bring it in.

1292
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:46,560
I wanted it to be in front of the sunglasses, but now...

1293
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:49,040
Uh-oh.

1294
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:54,970
My mustache is forever.

1295
01:42:00,810 --> 01:42:02,170
It's so close.

1296
01:42:02,330 --> 01:42:03,010
It's so far.

1297
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:12,820
If I look too far over, my head also becomes really big.

1298
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:17,120
So close.

1299
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:24,840

1304
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:07,070
The coolest glasses in the world.

01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:08,870
Oh, these are.

1306
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:13,250
No, these are terrible.

1307
01:43:17,330 --> 01:43:18,830
None of these are cool.

1308
01:43:19,230 --> 01:43:20,890
Okay, wait, I actually really like this one.

1309

This is my inspiration.

01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,180
Why won't you show the picture?

1312
01:43:37,580 --> 01:43:38,380
Wait, hold on.

1313
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:40,960

01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:41,320
Hello?

Hello?

1318
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:48,420

1319
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:48,960
Ah!

1320
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:50,760

1321
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:52,060
What's going on?

1322
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:54,400
Oh, there it is.

This is my...

1328
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:07,640
This is my inspiration.

1329
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:11,440
Wait!

1330
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:13,980
I can just become this man.

1331
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:14,920
Okay, hold on.

1332
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:17,240
He's bald.

01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:18,200
I can just take over.

1334
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:19,360
Okay.

1335
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:27,220
We can draw hair on him.

1336
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:38,560
It's like It's actually perfect It's actually perfect

1337

1338
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:04,560
Let's see.

1339
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:09,700
Let's do this.

1340
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:14,100
And then we'll draw my hair out here, too.

1341
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:19,280
Sorry, you're going to have to crop it, but I believe in
you.

1342
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:21,540
Actually, I want my hair fluffier.

1343
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:25,920
No, my hair is not that fluffy.

1344
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:28,180
Okay.

1345
01:45:33,670 --> 01:45:35,210
Oh wait, it goes in.

1346
01:45:35,430 --> 01:45:35,650
Never mind.

1347
01:45:39,310 --> 01:45:39,910
It's fine.

1348
01:45:40,030 --> 01:45:40,310
It's fine.

1349
01:45:40,630 --> 01:45:41,010
Just leave it.

1350
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:41,370
Just leave it.

1351
01:45:41,470 --> 01:45:42,330
I'm being a perfectionist.

1352
01:45:42,790 --> 01:45:43,710
I'm being a perfectionist.

1353
01:45:44,150 --> 01:45:44,150
Okay.

1354
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:48,370
Then let's put it, let's shade it in.

1355
01:45:49,970 --> 01:45:52,270
This time I'll actually use the big guns.

1356
01:45:52,830 --> 01:45:53,310
Oh no!

1357
01:45:54,810 --> 01:45:58,650
Okay, I'm gonna have to do a slightly, slightly less white.

1358
01:45:58,890 --> 01:45:59,370
There we go.

1359
01:46:01,090 --> 01:46:02,810
Mint cosplaying snake and solid is a thing.

1360
01:46:02,830 --> 01:46:13,010
the same time slightly less white color don't

1361
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:25,000
worry I'll go back I'll clean it up after I'll clean it up
after but you're gonna have to crop it sorry I'm not you

1362
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:36,300
know sometimes it somehow it feels even bolder what do you
mean oh wait but what about the this part okay we'll fix it

1363
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:36,960
we'll fix it.

1364
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:39,720
I'm gonna fix it.

1365
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:40,480
I'm gonna fix it.

1366
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:44,860
I'm gonna fix everything.

1367
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:46,040
Don't you worry.

1368
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:48,940
Don't you worry.

1369
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:50,840
We're gonna go in and we're gonna fix everything.

1370
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:52,660
This is gonna be great.

1371
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:55,080
She forgot to draw the growth.

1372
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,460
I'm not there yet!

1373
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:57,880
And it's not a growth!

1374
01:47:00,020 --> 01:47:01,880
I'm still just doing my hair!

1375
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:04,160
So impatient.

1376
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:05,840
Okay, what was I doing?

1377
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:06,440
Oh, okay.

1378
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:09,240
Now from here, we're going to do this, okay?

1379
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:10,080
You see?

1380
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:11,280
Oops.

1381
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:12,840
We're going to do that.

1382
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:15,700
We're going to get all the edges.

1383
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,460
I color outside the lines and then I fix it up.

1384
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:20,120
Maybe it's more time consuming.

1385
01:47:20,620 --> 01:47:21,400
I don't care.

1386
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:23,320
I'm just an artist here, okay?

1387
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,860
Stop criticizing my art.

1388
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:34,820
Don't criticize.

1389
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:36,280
That means you hate art.

1390
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:38,020
Do you hate art?

1391
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:43,280
Okay, this time I'm gonna have to...

1392
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:46,080
I'm getting really into this one, so I gotta...

1393
01:47:49,460 --> 01:47:53,600
Oh no, I don't want you to see his skin.

1394
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:00,700
No, no, no, no.

1395
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:02,760
Inside the lines, inside the lines.

1396
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:06,240
Inside the lines, inside the lines, inside the lines.

1397
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:08,480
Could I have redrawn this?

1398
01:48:09,380 --> 01:48:09,780
Probably.

1399
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:13,020
but this is for authenticity's sake, okay?

1400
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:17,020
Uh-oh, it's gonna disappear.

1401
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:19,820
Is my head bigger than this man's?

1402
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:22,620
Um, obviously, because I'm smarter.

1403
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:30,760
This is what they wanted, you guys.

1404
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:31,820
This is what they wanted.

1405
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:34,800
This is what they wanted.

1406
01:48:35,020 --> 01:48:35,820
This is what they wanted.

1407
01:48:42,980 --> 01:48:46,940
I feel really uncomfortable being this close to this guy's
head.

1408
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:50,860
I feel pretty uncomfortable right now.

1409
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:51,760
I'm not going to lie.

1410
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:53,520
I'm seeing every pore.

1411
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:58,020
Every single line in his forehead.

1412
01:48:58,640 --> 01:48:59,680
I'm seeing it all.

1413
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:07,240
I mean...

1414
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:08,540
Um...

1415
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:12,260
He's got nice skin, I'm assuming for his age, you know?

1416
01:49:12,940 --> 01:49:13,200
Oops.

1417
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:13,940
You know what?

1418
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:14,520
Screw it.

1419
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:15,600
Uh-huh.

1420
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:18,200
What the?

1421
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:19,280
No, no, no.

1422
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:21,060
Stop it.

1423
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:21,740
There we go.

1424
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:26,720
This is the future the boss envisioned.

1425
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:28,020
I can see his white hairs.

1426
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:28,380
I know!

1427
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:29,420
I can see everything!

1428
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:31,540
I can see everything!

1429
01:49:32,660 --> 01:49:33,380
Clean scalp.

1430
01:49:41,330 --> 01:49:41,730
Hold on.

1431
01:49:41,950 --> 01:49:42,610
Let's... Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1432
01:49:42,910 --> 01:49:44,990
Let's clean up this part right here.

1433
01:49:45,790 --> 01:49:46,090
Ah!

1434
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:49,010
Have you heard that?

1435
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:49,430
No, you didn't.

1436
01:49:49,450 --> 01:49:50,450
I didn't...

1437
01:49:52,290 --> 01:49:53,650
You know what, screw it, I don't care.

1438
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:57,450
Alright, let's do...

1439
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:02,450
What if I leave it this way where you can see just his...

1440
01:50:03,230 --> 01:50:05,450
You can see his head peeking through.

1441
01:50:11,470 --> 01:50:12,390
There we go.

1442
01:50:13,830 --> 01:50:14,770
Oh, I forgot my!

1443
01:50:15,030 --> 01:50:15,830
Oh my gosh.

1444
01:50:16,110 --> 01:50:17,570
How could I forget my twin tails?

1445
01:50:17,970 --> 01:50:18,990
Which was the layer?

1446
01:50:20,350 --> 01:50:21,210
This one.

1447
01:50:22,270 --> 01:50:23,630
How could I forget my twin tails?

1448
01:50:24,010 --> 01:50:24,270
Right?

1449
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:25,790
Oh my gosh, what's wrong?

1450
01:50:25,930 --> 01:50:27,710
I was like, something feels off.

1451
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:35,370
No.

1452
01:50:41,230 --> 01:50:43,950
My friend Mike has his birthday tomorrow.

1453
01:50:45,070 --> 01:50:46,090
Are you serious?

1454
01:50:49,010 --> 01:50:50,230
Are you for real?

1455
01:50:51,190 --> 01:50:51,750
Are you for real?

1456
01:50:51,970 --> 01:50:54,210
What's Mike's last name?

1457
01:50:56,670 --> 01:50:58,690
What's Mike's last name?

1458
01:51:00,670 --> 01:51:01,970
Tell me right now.

1459
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:15,860
It's perfect, it's perfect, it's perfect.

1460
01:51:17,060 --> 01:51:18,920
Don't worry about it.

1461
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:20,460
Hooter.

1462
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:22,120
Like the store?

1463
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:22,960
Like the restaurant?

1464
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:24,580
I've never been to a hooter's.

1465
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:29,360
I've never been to Hooters.

1466
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:32,580
And people say, like, go for the wings.

1467
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:37,500
But then people are also like, the wings aren't that good.

1468
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:39,140
So which is it?

1469
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:41,360
Which is it?

1470
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:44,580
Last name is Sugma.

1471
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:47,580
I don't believe you.

1472
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:50,740
That's a Pokemon.

1473
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:56,520
If his last name was Sugma, What?

1474
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:04,320
You know how like, you know, there's like last names that
were what they did back then in the day, like that

1475
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:05,400
originated from that.

1476
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:12,300
They were like, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm Casey Blacksmith, you
know, stuff like that.

1477
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:15,300
What did they do if their last name was Sugmo?

1478
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:19,400
Hooters is men, really?

1479
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:23,960
But it's like, it feels like so exciting to think about.

1480
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:26,220
Like, it's just like, wow, I'm going to Hooters.

1481
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:28,740
I'm going to Hooters.

1482
01:52:40,750 --> 01:52:42,570
It looks just like me.

1483
01:52:46,530 --> 01:52:48,430
He's already got the mustache even.

1484
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:52,010
Sucking poison.

1485
01:52:55,710 --> 01:52:57,010
I get it.

1486
01:52:57,090 --> 01:52:57,650
I get it.

1487
01:52:57,750 --> 01:52:58,230
I get it.

1488
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:05,000
Oh, wait.

1489
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:06,800
I'll make it smaller.

1490
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:07,780
There we go.

1491
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:10,480
I made it smaller.

1492
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:14,000
smaller so that you can see it.

1493
01:53:16,980 --> 01:53:18,960
There we go, perfect.

1494
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:26,780
Oh, I gotta write your name.

1495
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:30,420
B closing parentheses.

1496
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:40,160
Wait, can I fit it on his forehead?

1497
01:53:42,220 --> 01:53:44,000
Wait, my handwriting is too big.

1498
01:53:44,420 --> 01:53:44,760
B?

1499
01:53:52,180 --> 01:53:53,580
Closing...

1500
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:56,440
Closing...

1501
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:57,200

Uh...

1503
01:53:58,500 --> 01:53:59,040
No!

1504
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:02,500
P...

1505
01:54:02,940 --> 01:54:04,020
P...

1506
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:07,920
Parentheses...

1507
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:08,620
P...

1508
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:09,240
P...

1509
01:54:10,180 --> 01:54:10,980

1510
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:13,580

1511
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:15,440
Theth...

1512
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:19,260
Parenthesis.

1513
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:27,840
Sorry, it got a little small by the end.

1514
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:29,880
I hope you like this one.

1515
01:54:30,660 --> 01:54:32,280
I actually put so much effort into it.

1516
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,160
I hope you like it.

1517
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:39,320
I think I look really cool.

1518
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:42,500
I think I look really awesome.

1519
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:44,740
Hmm.

1520
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:50,600
Hold on.

1521
01:54:51,140 --> 01:54:52,120
Don't take it just yet.

1522
01:54:52,660 --> 01:54:53,460
Hold

1523
01:55:01,650 --> 01:55:01,950
on.

1524
01:55:02,470 --> 01:55:03,170
There we go.

1525
01:55:06,750 --> 01:55:09,090
There we go.

1526
01:55:09,290 --> 01:55:10,610
There we go.

1527
01:55:10,870 --> 01:55:12,350
Ah, important part.

1528
01:55:12,750 --> 01:55:14,230
There we go.

1529
01:55:15,970 --> 01:55:18,010
Now it really looks like me.

1530
01:55:19,110 --> 01:55:21,730
It looks so good, right?

1531
01:55:24,950 --> 01:55:25,810
Mm-hmm.

1532
01:55:27,110 --> 01:55:27,610
Hold on.

1533
01:55:27,750 --> 01:55:28,610
Let me move my cursor.

1534
01:55:28,790 --> 01:55:29,310
There you go.

1535
01:55:29,850 --> 01:55:30,850
Screen cap that.

1536
01:55:30,850 --> 01:55:31,530
Screen cap that.

1537
01:55:32,310 --> 01:55:33,510

Yeah, she's okay, I guess.

1542
01:55:43,850 --> 01:55:45,490
Like maybe she's amazing, but I don't know.

1543
01:55:48,010 --> 01:55:49,390
Free NFT.

01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:04,920
Get owned.

01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:13,320
You do not own me!

1592
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:17,040
Be closing parenthesis is my new identity.

1593
01:59:18,900 --> 01:59:21,220
I hope they...

1594
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:23,220
I don't know if they're here in the chat.

1595
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:23,980
If they are.

1596
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:27,980
Look at the chaos you've caused here.

1597
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:30,680
Look at the chaos you've caused here.

1598

Get owned.

1599
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:33,940

Isn't it abla, English?

1606
01:59:53,590 --> 01:59:56,770
You could say she's been minted.

1608

Oh, they said none.

1624
02:00:56,590 --> 02:00:57,970
On your request, they said none.

1625
02:00:58,110 --> 02:01:01,590
My profile pic being drawn by you is already a lot.

1626
02:01:02,110 --> 02:01:05,670
Ah, oh no, they wrote something really nice and I called
them a wimp.

1627
02:01:07,470 --> 02:01:07,990
No!

1628
02:01:10,890 --> 02:01:13,890

Since you're a Whisp, we're gonna draw you as a Whisp.

1634
02:01:33,790 --> 02:01:35,510
Oh, hold on.

1635
02:01:35,650 --> 02:01:36,550
I need more space.

1636
02:01:39,550 --> 02:01:40,870
But then...

1637
02:01:40,890 --> 02:01:44,830
They have Biffy arms.

1638
02:01:48,550 --> 02:01:49,810
Like that.

1639
02:01:54,050 --> 02:01:55,670

Biffy, beefy wisp.

1644
02:02:08,530 --> 02:02:10,670

Wait, neither do ground.

Okay, he's ready to go to town.

02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:36,640

1662
02:04:25,050 --> 02:04:26,810
It's a little bit more blue.

1663
02:04:28,630 --> 02:04:30,950
Kind of like this color.

1664
02:04:32,570 --> 02:04:33,570

1758
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:49,820
I'm not sure.

1759
02:10:50,620 --> 02:10:51,860
I think it's on YouTube then?

1760
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:52,260
Maybe.

1761
02:10:55,300 --> 02:10:58,520

Okay, they're either waving?

1806
02:14:06,140 --> 02:14:07,660

1808
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:14,680

02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:22,340
Okay, hold on.

1812
02:14:25,580 --> 02:14:26,300
Okay.

02:14:37,060 --> 02:14:37,800
Oh, you're right.

1815
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:41,580
Give me four.

1816
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:42,040
$4.

1817
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:44,180
You know what that's better because that's a spooky number.

1818
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:46,320
That's what I meant to put.

1819
02:14:46,740 --> 02:14:52,360
As a ghost, I can only count up to 4 because anything beyond
5 doesn't really matter.

1820
02:14:54,280 --> 02:15:01,840
Anything beyond 4 doesn't matter at all because only $5 I
mean, no, only $4 matters.

1821
02:15:07,680 --> 02:15:10,340
And, uh, give me $4.

1822
02:15:17,080 --> 02:15:25,000
Let's see, she's got a little, she's got a little bit of a,
of a blush here.

1823
02:15:27,180 --> 02:15:36,780
The hair color that your profile picture has is like kind of
a ashy, um, it's like a yellowy grayish color.

1824
02:15:37,140 --> 02:15:38,800
Maybe, yeah, I like that.

1825
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:39,460
Perfect.

1826
02:15:50,770 --> 02:15:52,710
Oh my gosh, thanks for the four dollars.

1827
02:15:56,670 --> 02:15:57,530
Thank you.

1828
02:15:58,290 --> 02:15:58,750

02:15:59,030 --> 02:15:59,430
Okay, it's okay.

02:15:59,650 --> 02:16:00,470
You guys can stop now.

1831
02:16:00,610 --> 02:16:01,450
You guys can stop now.

1832
02:16:01,970 --> 02:16:02,970
The bit's over.

1833
02:16:03,130 --> 02:16:03,610
The bit's done.

1834
02:16:03,910 --> 02:16:04,890
We've left the bit.

1835
02:16:05,570 --> 02:16:06,850
We have abandoned the bit.

1836
02:16:07,230 --> 02:16:07,830
The bit is done.

1837
02:16:07,970 --> 02:16:08,530
The bit is over.

1838
02:16:09,650 --> 02:16:15,130
We are moving on to the next thing.

1839
02:16:18,230 --> 02:16:19,110
Thank you.

1840
02:16:19,950 --> 02:16:20,410
Beige.

1841
02:16:21,310 --> 02:16:22,710
I guess it's kind of beige.

1842
02:16:22,730 --> 02:16:27,750
I guess beige is a better way to put it.

1843
02:16:28,250 --> 02:16:33,690
But it's like, but like when you go to the hair salon, this
hair color is like very popular.

1844
02:16:34,190 --> 02:16:38,230

now.

1845
02:16:39,090 --> 02:16:42,870
And it's like a dusty brown is how they describe it.

02:16:46,530 --> 02:16:47,810
Like dusty pink.

1848
02:16:50,450 --> 02:16:51,610
Anything dusty.

1849
02:16:53,610 --> 02:16:55,330
And they mean it in like a good way.

1850
02:16:57,470 --> 02:16:59,450
Kind of looks like you know from Hidden Marry Sketch.

1851

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1857
02:17:07,190 --> 02:17:07,910

02:22:14,250 --> 02:22:14,630
Um...

1944
02:22:15,150 --> 02:22:16,350
It's, uh...

1945
02:22:22,470 --> 02:22:25,030
Maybe mine is actually Cashew's.

1946
02:22:27,610 --> 02:22:32,050
They asked for Doma and Cashew from G Gundam.

1947
02:22:32,370 --> 02:22:35,670
But it's just his hair and clothes on a cashew nut.

1948
02:22:36,730 --> 02:22:37,870
Domon cashew.

1949
02:22:42,670 --> 02:22:43,270
Okay.

1950
02:22:44,630 --> 02:22:45,990
I have to look this guy up.

1951
02:22:53,570 --> 02:22:54,170
Oh, wait.

1952
02:22:54,270 --> 02:22:56,710
There's a cashew in the chat.

1953
02:22:57,450 --> 02:22:59,090
Wait, this is just like with turtles.

1954
02:22:59,770 --> 02:23:00,290
And turtle.

1955
02:23:00,510 --> 02:23:04,270
How is this happening more than once?

1956
02:23:05,090 --> 02:23:05,290
What?

1957
02:23:05,410 --> 02:23:05,570
Wait.

1958
02:23:06,150 --> 02:23:06,890
Just cashew.

1959
02:23:07,290 --> 02:23:08,070
Oh my gosh!

1960
02:23:09,070 --> 02:23:10,010
Oh wait.

1961
02:23:11,410 --> 02:23:12,710
Oh no, I don't see you.

1962
02:23:13,590 --> 02:23:14,650
There's just cashews.

1963
02:23:14,970 --> 02:23:15,850
Cashew, did you not submit?

1964
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:23,080
Oh my gosh, turtle!

1965
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:25,720
I like your profile picture.

1966
02:23:28,260 --> 02:23:30,860
I like your profile picture.

1967
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:38,460
Cashews and cashew are both in check.

1968
02:23:38,480 --> 02:23:39,680
Oh, there's...

1969
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:40,820
Wait, I didn't enter.

1970
02:23:40,980 --> 02:23:43,000
I need to keep my picture for branding.

1971
02:23:44,940 --> 02:23:45,460
Branding.

1972
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:46,140
I understand.

1973
02:23:46,580 --> 02:23:47,040
That's okay.

1974
02:23:47,860 --> 02:23:48,420
I get it.

1975
02:23:49,240 --> 02:23:50,080
It could have been you.

1976
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:52,920
I get it.

1977
02:23:53,300 --> 02:23:55,620
I'm not good enough for your brand, huh?

1978
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:58,400
Thank you, thank you.

1979
02:23:58,520 --> 02:24:01,000
Oh, four dollars.

1980
02:24:01,300 --> 02:24:01,780
No more?

1981
02:24:02,480 --> 02:24:02,980
No less.

1982
02:24:03,560 --> 02:24:04,260
Thank you.

1983
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:06,720
Very true.

1984
02:24:07,140 --> 02:24:08,460
And I get to keep all of them.

1985
02:24:08,480 --> 02:24:18,720
that because if it was youtube they'd take 30 but i get to
keep that

1986
02:24:22,400 --> 02:24:32,040
caches are actually related to poison ivy and can't be
touched with your bare hands really really i'm always so

1987
02:24:32,040 --> 02:24:40,660
scared what if one day i get a almond that like devolved and
i eat it and it's you know what I mean

1988
02:24:44,290 --> 02:24:53,510
what if I what if it like returns to being an evil almond
and I eat it and I die what if it genetically regresses and

1989
02:24:53,510 --> 02:24:57,710
then I mean I'm already dead but like I worry for you guys

1990
02:25:04,950 --> 02:25:10,210
wait really what do you mean really did you not know that
about almond

1991
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:24,180
Streamlabs still blocked for you or are they paying you now
I haven't I haven't received any money since I well like

1992
02:25:24,180 --> 02:25:34,240
it's it's all trapped in PayPal and then YouTube hasn't paid
me so I haven't received anything I haven't received

1993
02:25:34,240 --> 02:25:43,920
anything but it's okay I'm alright I still paid rent I'm
okay this sounds fake no almonds.

1994
02:25:44,660 --> 02:25:46,200
Almonds used to be poisonous.

1995
02:25:48,480 --> 02:25:50,040
Almonds used to be poisonous.

1996
02:25:50,280 --> 02:25:50,620
It's true.

1997
02:25:59,320 --> 02:26:05,580
Yeah, it's just in PayPal jail because, well, I'm really
lucky I can use PayPal because what happened before I

1998
02:26:05,580 --> 02:26:13,900
graduated was they marked me as suspicious and I and they
were like, you can never use PayPal again.

1999
02:26:13,980 --> 02:26:16,780
You can never open another PayPal again in your life.

2000
02:26:16,940 --> 02:26:26,120
You can never even smell You can never look You don't even
glance in our direction PayPal hates you now You are on the

2001
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:30,260
hit list You are You are forever banned

2002
02:26:33,880 --> 02:26:49,740
For the silly drawings Ah thanks And so I had to come up
with another way To get the Streamlabs Donations And um and

2003
02:26:49,740 --> 02:27:01,780
uh that was three years ago yeah it was three years ago that
happened um but i figured i have i have worked around it to

2004
02:27:01,780 --> 02:27:02,880
the best of my ability

2005
02:27:07,260 --> 02:27:20,320
so um yeah it was complicated so it's still a problem kind
of uh but it's okay I hear that happens all the time or not

2006
02:27:20,320 --> 02:27:27,660
all the time but more often than it should where it's like I
see like artists who will be like my PayPal got banned

2007
02:27:27,660 --> 02:27:38,600
forever and I can't do anything about it so PayPal is kind
of icky can't you contact their customer support oh yeah I

2008
02:27:38,600 --> 02:27:48,800
definitely tried and uh they were like sorry we literally
can't do anything I was like oh Okay.

2009
02:27:52,320 --> 02:27:53,820
Thanks for nothing.

2010
02:27:56,940 --> 02:27:57,420
Yeah.

2011
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:00,520
It's fine though.

2012
02:28:00,820 --> 02:28:01,620
It's fine.

2013
02:28:02,500 --> 02:28:02,900
Things are fine.

2014
02:28:05,100 --> 02:28:06,200
Things are fine.

2015
02:28:06,380 --> 02:28:07,260
It's just the issue.

2016
02:28:07,660 --> 02:28:14,040
I think, I think when I went to heaven, I was very excited
because I was like, oh my gosh, I don't have to deal with

2017
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:15,900
PayPal anymore.

2018
02:28:17,100 --> 02:28:17,600
I don't want to.

2019
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:20,300
I was like, oh my gosh, I never have to deal with them
anymore.

2020
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:21,840
This is so awesome.

2021
02:28:22,520 --> 02:28:25,180
And then when I came back, I was like, ah.

2022
02:28:28,320 --> 02:28:30,440
The troubles of being indie.

2023
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:36,060
But I was like, oh man.

2024
02:28:37,720 --> 02:28:38,160
That was funny.

02:28:38,300 --> 02:28:39,240

2026
02:28:41,060 --> 02:28:44,700

Hell yeah, he is.

02:31:51,790 --> 02:31:52,130
Yeah!

2049
02:31:57,550 --> 02:32:01,870
Speaking of cashews, my neighbor has a cashew tree, and my
fridge is full of them!

2050
02:32:02,010 --> 02:32:03,030
Cashew juice is super...

2051
02:32:03,030 --> 02:32:06,730
I'm so jealous because cashews are so expensive!

2052
02:32:07,890 --> 02:32:08,290
Nice.

2053
02:32:08,970 --> 02:32:13,410
I believe Mint can make friends despite her What do you mean
despite my smell?

2054
02:32:13,590 --> 02:32:14,830
I'm so minty fresh.

2055
02:32:15,670 --> 02:32:16,930
It's not me that smelly.

2056
02:32:18,070 --> 02:32:18,830
He has multiple?

2057
02:32:19,610 --> 02:32:19,810
Oh.

2058
02:32:20,710 --> 02:32:23,270
Oh my god, I see your profile pictures.

2059
02:32:25,110 --> 02:32:26,510
Okay, hold on.

2060
02:32:28,530 --> 02:32:30,050
Like, I see this one.

2061
02:32:30,910 --> 02:32:32,490
But I think your profile picture...

2062
02:32:32,490 --> 02:32:34,650
This one is from Dynasty Warriors, though.

2063
02:32:36,410 --> 02:32:39,250
I think your profile picture seems to be his normal outfit.

2064
02:32:39,370 --> 02:32:40,330
Okay, so there's this one.

2065
02:32:41,170 --> 02:32:42,590
Then there's...

2066
02:32:43,100 --> 02:32:44,250
I don't want to cosplay.

2067
02:32:46,210 --> 02:32:46,830
Uh...

2068
02:32:47,570 --> 02:32:48,190
Uh...

2069
02:32:48,190 --> 02:32:48,750
This one?

2070
02:32:49,390 --> 02:32:50,150
It's so tiny.

2071
02:32:50,270 --> 02:32:51,150
Why is it so small?

2072
02:32:51,290 --> 02:32:52,290
I can't see it.

2073
02:32:52,950 --> 02:32:53,430
This one?

2074
02:32:53,930 --> 02:32:55,930
This one, but with the red cape.

2075
02:32:57,270 --> 02:32:58,030
Which did you want?

2076
02:33:03,070 --> 02:33:05,570
Excuse me, spiky bread coming through.

2077
02:33:06,230 --> 02:33:06,610
No!

2078
02:33:07,830 --> 02:33:08,450
Stop!

2079
02:33:08,690 --> 02:33:09,350
It hurts!

2080
02:33:09,930 --> 02:33:11,890
That's his Gundam fighter suit.

2081
02:33:18,050 --> 02:33:19,870
That one is good enough.

2082
02:33:20,590 --> 02:33:21,130
Which one?

2083
02:33:21,450 --> 02:33:22,990
I posted both.

2084
02:33:25,490 --> 02:33:27,730
I'll just do the one on the left, maybe.

2085
02:33:29,950 --> 02:33:32,610
Because I think that's what he's wearing in your profile
picture.

2086
02:33:35,270 --> 02:33:37,610
In my mind, you smell like Baja Blast and not Mint.

2087
02:33:37,990 --> 02:33:39,430
I don't even know what that smells like.

2088
02:33:39,570 --> 02:33:41,110
But I'm assuming it's fruity, right?

2089
02:33:44,290 --> 02:33:54,470
that one yeah that one I pick that one pick number three my
lord um okay I'm gonna I'm gonna have this on the screen

2090
02:33:54,470 --> 02:34:10,690
though wait there we go okay put that right over there and
um it's chemically oh they said left oh okay thank you oh oh

2091
02:34:12,950 --> 02:34:16,030
This hand of mine glows with an awesome power!

2092
02:34:16,450 --> 02:34:19,330
Its burning grip tells me to defeat you!

2093
02:34:19,990 --> 02:34:22,090
It makes sense if you watch G-Gundum.

2094
02:34:22,950 --> 02:34:23,650
Thanks, Virulent.

2095
02:34:29,030 --> 02:34:29,390
Oh god.

2096
02:34:29,770 --> 02:34:31,650
I now need to find a picture of Akashio.

2097
02:34:35,210 --> 02:34:35,770
What?

2098
02:34:41,030 --> 02:34:42,710
I think I'm gonna be sick.

2099
02:34:43,630 --> 02:34:47,450
what cashews look like from the tree?

2100
02:34:48,650 --> 02:34:54,030
I realize I have never seen a cashew on a tree before, and
it's hideous.

2101
02:34:54,530 --> 02:34:55,830
It's disgusting.

2102
02:34:56,030 --> 02:34:56,990
What is this?

2103
02:34:57,310 --> 02:35:00,250
Oh my god, it looks like a little worm coming out.

2104
02:35:01,170 --> 02:35:02,450
Oh my god!

2105
02:35:02,970 --> 02:35:04,770
Oh my god, it's awful.

2106
02:35:05,590 --> 02:35:06,490
Look at this.

2107
02:35:09,790 --> 02:35:11,130
Oh my god.

2108
02:35:13,630 --> 02:35:13,970
What?

2109
02:35:14,430 --> 02:35:15,630
What is this?

2110
02:35:21,390 --> 02:35:23,630
It looks so gross!

2111
02:35:26,350 --> 02:35:29,270
It's like an apple with a worm coming out!

2112
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:37,980
I've never seen a cashew tree before!

2113
02:35:39,060 --> 02:35:39,860
Oh no!

2114
02:35:40,500 --> 02:35:43,460
Oh my god, these are so gross!

2115
02:35:47,740 --> 02:35:48,420
No!

2116
02:35:53,500 --> 02:35:56,840
Wait, the cashew nut is not the top part?

2117
02:35:58,860 --> 02:36:01,040
Wait, where's the cashew nut?

2118
02:36:01,420 --> 02:36:02,500
It's the top part, right?

2119
02:36:03,880 --> 02:36:05,680
Don't seed shame it.

2120
02:36:07,640 --> 02:36:09,000
Where do you...

2121
02:36:15,180 --> 02:36:16,140
Where's the cashew nut?

2122
02:36:16,140 --> 02:36:17,160
Where's the cashew nut?

2123
02:36:18,960 --> 02:36:20,680
Is it inside here?

2124
02:36:21,380 --> 02:36:22,240
Inside this part?

2125
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:28,560
Or this, because this looks like it's cut open and there's
no cashew nut here.

2126
02:36:31,340 --> 02:36:33,360
Mint ruined cashews first.

2127
02:36:33,900 --> 02:36:36,220
So, wait, what does an almond look like?

2128
02:36:38,060 --> 02:36:38,580
Almond.

2129
02:36:40,420 --> 02:36:42,560
Oh, see this one looks like a nut.

2130
02:36:43,060 --> 02:36:44,300
This one looks so normal.

2131
02:36:45,720 --> 02:36:46,880
This one looks...

2132
02:36:47,740 --> 02:36:48,940
It's kind of fuzzy.

2133
02:36:48,960 --> 02:36:51,120
Looks normal.

2134
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:53,000
Normal nut.

2135
02:36:53,360 --> 02:36:53,940
Normal nut.

2136
02:36:55,300 --> 02:36:56,340
Nothing, no big deal.

2137
02:36:56,720 --> 02:36:57,380
Normal nut.

2138
02:36:58,160 --> 02:36:58,780
NBD.

2139
02:37:00,780 --> 02:37:01,580
NBD.

2140
02:37:06,700 --> 02:37:09,060
Zucchini is actually prettier when you see it.

2141
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:11,360
Zucchini.

2142
02:37:11,500 --> 02:37:15,280
Can zucchinis have flowers on them or am I lying?

2143
02:37:19,480 --> 02:37:21,300
Oh, I want some zucchini now.

2144
02:37:22,160 --> 02:37:22,920
I'm kind of hungry.

2145
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:26,100
Oh my gosh, I just realized I haven't had dinner.

2146
02:37:27,420 --> 02:37:28,480
I can do a few more.

2147
02:37:29,600 --> 02:37:30,360
Zucchinis look normal.

2148
02:37:32,900 --> 02:37:34,500
Normal nut, normal nut.

2149
02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:39,360
Okay, let me find a cashew.

2150
02:37:44,580 --> 02:37:45,380
Cashew nut.

2151
02:37:47,500 --> 02:37:58,980
Oh my god It's so gross It's so nasty Sorry Cashew, I'm not
calling you nasty I'm calling your baby pictures nasty

2152
02:38:04,500 --> 02:38:09,340
Why can't I find just a singular nut Cashew nut

2153
02:38:15,500 --> 02:38:25,630
Hmm Perfect.

2154
02:38:35,210 --> 02:38:35,850
Okay.

2155
02:38:36,990 --> 02:38:37,310
Perfect.

2156
02:38:39,110 --> 02:38:39,250
All right.

2157
02:38:39,450 --> 02:38:42,290
Now we're going to draw him onto this nut.

2158
02:38:43,810 --> 02:38:44,670
Why is it glistening?

2159
02:38:45,130 --> 02:38:45,750
It's oily.

2160
02:38:47,670 --> 02:38:50,130
Cashews have oil on them.

2161
02:38:50,690 --> 02:38:51,670
A little bit at least.

2162
02:38:51,870 --> 02:38:52,150
Don't they?

2163
02:38:52,570 --> 02:38:53,570
It's like a cashew oil.

2164
02:38:55,070 --> 02:38:56,830
Let's start with his hair.

2165
02:39:08,700 --> 02:39:09,100
Wait.

2166
02:39:17,250 --> 02:39:18,690
This is so anime.

2167
02:39:19,690 --> 02:39:21,590
This is what I feel like I drew as a kid.

2168
02:39:23,110 --> 02:39:24,290
Like this kind of hairstyle.

2169
02:39:27,070 --> 02:39:32,750
This is like the hairstyle I drew as a kid when I was like,
Oh, I'm gonna be an anime artist.

2170
02:39:36,610 --> 02:39:39,850
Anime nut, anime nut, anime nut.

2171
02:39:41,670 --> 02:39:43,510
More likely than you think.

2172
02:39:44,090 --> 02:39:46,010
We're going to cover up his little pooper right there.

2173
02:39:47,050 --> 02:39:47,810
Right there.

2174
02:39:50,430 --> 02:39:52,690
Indecent, indecent, indecent, indecent.

2175
02:39:53,710 --> 02:39:53,850
Whoops.

2176
02:39:54,570 --> 02:39:55,690
Oh, oh, it's back.

2177
02:39:56,290 --> 02:39:56,550
Um.

2178
02:39:58,310 --> 02:39:58,910
Okay.

2179
02:40:06,190 --> 02:40:07,170
It's a nut.

2180
02:40:07,190 --> 02:40:11,250
It's not, it's not, it's not, it's a not.

2181
02:40:11,370 --> 02:40:12,150
Oh, hi Hannah!

2182
02:40:13,830 --> 02:40:15,550
It's a not, it's a not.

2183
02:40:16,590 --> 02:40:17,590
It's a not.

2184
02:40:22,280 --> 02:40:24,860
It's a, what's a not with you?

2185
02:40:34,660 --> 02:40:36,720
Man, I'm the best at jokes.

2186
02:40:39,620 --> 02:40:41,670
I'm so good at jokes, you guys.

2187
02:40:48,800 --> 02:40:49,540
Not much.

2188
02:40:50,760 --> 02:40:51,640
Not much.

2189
02:40:51,960 --> 02:40:52,740
How about you?

2190
02:40:54,440 --> 02:40:55,840
Nacho cheese.

2191
02:41:16,890 --> 02:41:18,250
Busting a nut.

2192
02:41:18,570 --> 02:41:18,890
No!

2193
02:41:20,250 --> 02:41:21,450
Save the nut.

2194
02:41:21,610 --> 02:41:22,250
Save the nut.

2195
02:41:23,750 --> 02:41:25,010
Don't beat him up.

2196
02:41:26,650 --> 02:41:28,090
Don't bust him up.

2197
02:41:29,210 --> 02:41:31,710
Bust a move instead of busting a nut.

2198
02:41:34,970 --> 02:41:37,630
Oh my gosh, I knew you guys would love it.

2199
02:41:37,730 --> 02:41:38,920
I knew you guys would love it.

2200
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:56,780
Oh no, it looks too awesome.

2201
02:41:59,480 --> 02:42:01,420
It looks just like him, doesn't it?

2202
02:42:02,700 --> 02:42:04,640
It honestly looks so good.

2203
02:42:08,620 --> 02:42:10,500
It honestly looks so good.

2204
02:42:12,260 --> 02:42:20,080
It kind of feels like, you know how like making visual
novels of like, you know, pigeons and weird characters, like

2205
02:42:20,080 --> 02:42:21,640
the KFC and one.

2206

Bust in a nut.

2207
02:42:23,900 --> 02:42:24,860
Mint Fantomo.

Ah, buh-buh-buh.

2233
02:44:48,290 --> 02:44:55,110
Like, I'm trying to follow the picture itself, but I think
my perspective is wrong.

2234
02:44:56,650 --> 02:44:58,590
I need to go back to art school.

2282
02:48:14,850 --> 02:48:17,430
It's because YouTube chat on...

2283
02:48:17,430 --> 02:48:19,930
on browser is breaking.

2284
02:48:21,650 --> 02:48:22,870
Rock for Rabbit, thank you!

2285
02:48:23,670 --> 02:48:24,090

Hold on.

2287
02:48:25,910 --> 02:48:26,190
Wait.

2288
02:48:26,590 --> 02:48:27,950
I couldn't read it.

2289
02:48:27,950 --> 02:48:28,290
It was too slow.

There we go.

2297
02:49:13,390 --> 02:49:15,590
That should be good for your profile picture, right?

2298
02:49:18,170 --> 02:49:19,550
Cashews, here you are.

2299
02:49:20,030 --> 02:49:20,190
Oh, wait.

2300
02:49:20,250 --> 02:49:20,990
Let me write your name.

2301
02:49:21,530 --> 02:49:22,930
Wait, was it cashews or cashew?

2302
02:49:25,830 --> 02:49:26,270
Cashews.

2303
02:49:28,310 --> 02:49:29,470
Yeah, next to the vibe gifted!

2304
02:49:29,890 --> 02:49:30,270
Katsu!

2305
02:49:30,530 --> 02:49:31,410
Thank you for the...

2306
02:49:31,410 --> 02:49:32,630
Thank you!

2307
02:49:33,130 --> 02:49:36,310
Oh my gosh.

2308
02:49:37,450 --> 02:49:38,730
Thank you for all the super chats.

2309
02:49:39,050 --> 02:49:40,090
It is so delayed.

2310
02:49:40,210 --> 02:49:41,010
I'm so sorry.

2311
02:49:41,910 --> 02:49:47,390
Oh yeah.

2312
02:49:48,190 --> 02:49:48,530
Oh yeah.

2313
02:49:49,650 --> 02:49:50,210
Wait.

2314
02:49:50,830 --> 02:49:53,650
I'm trying to draw it along as luscious curves.

2315
02:50:00,920 --> 02:50:01,600
There we go.

2316
02:50:03,400 --> 02:50:04,680
There you go, Cashews!

2317
02:50:05,940 --> 02:50:07,640
I think this one's my best one yet, maybe.

2318
02:50:08,060 --> 02:50:09,400
Sorry that the collar is a little weird.

2319
02:50:09,640 --> 02:50:10,180
Just ignore it.

2320
02:50:11,100 --> 02:50:11,840
Nobody will sell.

2321
02:50:11,960 --> 02:50:12,800
Nobody will see it.

2322
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:14,100
It'll be too small.

2323
02:50:16,100 --> 02:50:17,580
Congrats on 200k.

2324
02:50:17,720 --> 02:50:18,480
Thank you!

2325
02:50:18,900 --> 02:50:19,900
Thank you, guys!

2326
02:50:21,420 --> 02:50:22,700
Crude Matter, thanks for the five.

2327
02:50:22,960 --> 02:50:23,840
Oh, Captain!

2328
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:26,820
Orthwarm, Jeb.

2329
02:50:27,420 --> 02:50:27,980
Thank you.

2330
02:50:30,240 --> 02:50:33,020
Do you think you'd consider doing midday mink?

2331
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:34,840
I miss listening to it at work.

2332
02:50:35,400 --> 02:50:36,340
I definitely want to.

2333
02:50:36,420 --> 02:50:38,320
I just want to be in a server, maybe.

2334
02:50:38,940 --> 02:50:44,280
I can still probably be on a private thing.

2335
02:50:44,800 --> 02:50:46,540
Mike, thanks for the 100.

2336
02:50:47,240 --> 02:50:48,240
Thank you for the Akasupa.

2337
02:50:49,480 --> 02:50:51,060
Congrats on 200KU Spooky Ghost.

2338
02:50:51,420 --> 02:50:51,720
Thank you.

2339
02:50:51,960 --> 02:50:52,940
Thank you so much.

2340
02:50:53,140 --> 02:50:53,600
Oh my gosh.

2341
02:50:53,800 --> 02:50:54,820
Thank you, guys.

2342
02:51:02,160 --> 02:51:02,640
Woohoo!

2343
02:51:03,040 --> 02:51:04,580
It really is the best one.

2344
02:51:04,600 --> 02:51:06,600
I think this one is my best one.

2345
02:51:10,580 --> 02:51:12,900
Oh my gosh, PhD killers!

2346
02:51:13,140 --> 02:51:14,140
Thanks for six months.

2347
02:51:14,640 --> 02:51:16,460
Membership 200,000.

2348
02:51:16,680 --> 02:51:17,600
Oh, man, it's all.

2349
02:51:18,360 --> 02:51:19,640
Six months ago.

2350
02:51:20,380 --> 02:51:21,240
I was not.

2351
02:51:21,460 --> 02:51:23,500
I was at like 10k.

2352
02:51:25,400 --> 02:51:26,700
Now I'm back.

2353
02:51:27,340 --> 02:51:28,600
And I just hit 200k.

2354
02:51:31,480 --> 02:51:31,880
Crazy.

2355
02:51:32,400 --> 02:51:33,860
Crazy, crazy, crazy.

2356
02:51:34,600 --> 02:51:35,580
Oh, one block.

2357
02:51:35,860 --> 02:51:37,400
I do like one block.

2358
02:51:38,600 --> 02:51:39,960
You're a super...

2359
02:51:39,960 --> 02:51:40,440
No!

2360
02:51:40,860 --> 02:51:41,800
Thank you.

2361
02:51:42,020 --> 02:51:42,620
200k.

2362
02:51:42,720 --> 02:51:44,020
Let's go bust a nut.

2363
02:51:44,600 --> 02:51:45,200
Woohoo!

2364
02:51:46,240 --> 02:51:47,940
Marilyn, thank you for the five gifted.

2365
02:51:48,520 --> 02:51:49,120
Misakuchi!

2366
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:54,480
Thank you for the 10.

2367
02:51:54,600 --> 02:51:56,160
I love your profile picture.

2368
02:52:00,100 --> 02:52:01,620
Oh my gosh.

2369
02:52:02,340 --> 02:52:03,960

Thank you.

2375
02:52:35,680 --> 02:52:36,060
Oh my god.

2376
02:52:36,200 --> 02:52:37,440
The claps are for me.

2377
02:52:37,860 --> 02:52:38,720
The claps are for me.

2378
02:52:38,820 --> 02:52:41,880
Next person is Alaric.

2379
02:52:42,580 --> 02:52:44,000
Alaric, if you're here.

2380
02:52:44,840 --> 02:52:45,360
Congratulations.

2381
02:52:47,700 --> 02:52:48,220
Congratulations.

2382
02:52:49,840 --> 02:52:50,900
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2383
02:52:51,180 --> 02:52:51,480
Undo?

2384
02:52:56,440 --> 02:52:56,760
Uh.

2385
02:52:59,520 --> 02:53:00,040
Wait.

2386
02:53:00,680 --> 02:53:00,960
Oh, wait.

2387
02:53:00,960 --> 02:53:01,020
Uh-oh.

2388
02:53:05,880 --> 02:53:07,920
You entered twice!

2389
02:53:12,120 --> 02:53:12,680
Haleric.

2390
02:53:13,520 --> 02:53:13,900
Wait, what?

2391
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:14,260
No.

2392
02:53:14,800 --> 02:53:16,080
Haleric, you entered twice.

2393
02:53:17,640 --> 02:53:18,620
What is this?

2394
02:53:19,160 --> 02:53:20,160
I'm kind of scared.

2395
02:53:20,420 --> 02:53:21,440
You sent a picture.

2396
02:53:22,800 --> 02:53:24,120
Or a link to a picture.

2397
02:53:30,340 --> 02:53:32,000
Haleric, you entered twice.

2398
02:53:32,260 --> 02:53:33,780
Why did you enter twice?

2399
02:53:35,640 --> 02:53:38,900
You asked for the same thing both times!

2400
02:53:40,340 --> 02:53:41,480
I saw you were in chat.

2401
02:53:41,660 --> 02:53:42,940
What do you have to say for yourself?

2402
02:53:45,440 --> 02:53:46,240
Shame him.

2403
02:53:46,480 --> 02:53:46,960
I am.

2404
02:53:48,960 --> 02:53:50,440
What do you have to...

2405
02:53:50,440 --> 02:53:52,640
What do you have to say for yourself?

2406
02:54:00,190 --> 02:54:02,510
This is like...

2407
02:54:02,510 --> 02:54:06,690
I kind of want to draw this though, which is why I'm...

2408
02:54:14,860 --> 02:54:16,340
Where did you go?

2409
02:54:16,820 --> 02:54:18,160
I can't tell if you've...

2410
02:54:18,160 --> 02:54:19,460
I didn't mean to?

2411
02:54:20,720 --> 02:54:23,360
What do you mean you didn't mean to?

2412
02:54:23,960 --> 02:54:25,000
What do you mean?

2413
02:54:26,660 --> 02:54:27,360
Okay.

2414
02:54:28,740 --> 02:54:30,680
Because you entered twice.

2415
02:54:32,220 --> 02:54:33,620
I will...

2416
02:54:33,620 --> 02:54:34,940
I'll still do it.

2417
02:54:36,180 --> 02:54:37,800
But I will set a timer.

2418
02:54:38,640 --> 02:54:42,020
Where I only have one minute to draw it.

2419
02:54:42,620 --> 02:54:44,660
And the thing you asked me to draw?

2420
02:54:49,240 --> 02:54:51,020
But peculiar things are the gifted!

2421
02:55:02,810 --> 02:55:03,630
Do we forgive?

2422
02:55:04,010 --> 02:55:05,050
We're shaming a little bit.

2423
02:55:07,530 --> 02:55:12,050
Oh my god, I don't want this person's butt on my screen so
large.

2424
02:55:15,090 --> 02:55:16,870
What is the context of this photo?

2425
02:55:17,010 --> 02:55:17,970
Actually, I don't want to know.

2426
02:55:19,390 --> 02:55:19,710
Okay.

2427
02:55:22,630 --> 02:55:27,230
I don't even know what this is, but I'm going to give myself
one minute

2428
02:55:32,490 --> 02:55:35,050
to draw this.

2429
02:55:37,170 --> 02:55:40,550
And, um, starting now.

2430
02:56:48,120 --> 02:56:48,640
Time.

2431
02:56:57,180 --> 02:56:59,120
Just boys being boys.

2432
02:57:00,520 --> 02:57:01,360
Congrats on 200K.

2433
02:57:02,160 --> 02:57:03,040
Thank you!

2434
02:57:03,980 --> 02:57:04,860
Thank you!

2435
02:57:06,020 --> 02:57:07,480
This is the horse.

2436
02:57:08,960 --> 02:57:09,620
By the one.

2437
02:57:10,340 --> 02:57:11,820
By the one right here.

2438
02:57:13,520 --> 02:57:14,580
That's that guy.

2439
02:57:16,300 --> 02:57:17,220
That's the horse.

2440
02:57:18,380 --> 02:57:19,140
What's up?

2441
02:57:19,260 --> 02:57:20,360
Thanks for the vibe, gifted.

2442
02:57:20,440 --> 02:57:21,140
Thank you so much!

2443
02:57:22,040 --> 02:57:23,820
I think I actually got it pretty well.

2444
02:57:24,660 --> 02:57:26,240
I think I got it pretty well, actually.

2445
02:57:28,140 --> 02:57:29,000
Let me write your name.

2446
02:57:36,560 --> 02:57:44,080
It's uh, it's more, it's less of a profile pic because it's
kind of more portrait style, but, um, I did my best.

2447
02:57:45,660 --> 02:57:51,860
Um, sorry, I'm not gonna color it in because, uh, I sped run
it.

2448
02:57:52,620 --> 02:57:54,480
I call this one Metal Gear.

2449
02:57:57,260 --> 02:57:59,540
Yeah, everybody's watching, they're enjoying.

2450
02:58:00,600 --> 02:58:01,740
I think this one's pretty good.

2451
02:58:04,240 --> 02:58:05,160
Oh, hold on.

2452
02:58:05,320 --> 02:58:07,320
I did forget this one.

2453
02:58:07,640 --> 02:58:08,420
It's it.

2454
02:58:10,040 --> 02:58:11,380
There's his other arm.

2455
02:58:13,320 --> 02:58:14,380
He's giving him a head pat.

2456
02:58:17,460 --> 02:58:19,800
He's giving him a head pat, obviously.

2457
02:58:21,260 --> 02:58:21,840
There we go.

2458
02:58:24,460 --> 02:58:25,100
I

2459
02:58:28,770 --> 02:58:29,410
stretch.

2460
02:58:30,990 --> 02:58:31,150
Okay.

2461
02:58:31,730 --> 02:58:33,070
This belongs in a museum.

2462
02:58:33,410 --> 02:58:34,550
It belongs in a museum.

2463
02:58:35,130 --> 02:58:35,790

02:58:40,990 --> 02:58:43,990

Wait, hold on.

03:00:04,510 --> 03:00:05,970
Where are you?

2488
03:00:07,390 --> 03:00:08,630
Hold on, I'm looking.

03:00:12,780 --> 03:00:15,620

I hope you guys like this style.

2491
03:00:17,680 --> 03:00:21,340
I just feel like it's, like I said, it's less overwhelming
for me.

2492
03:00:21,800 --> 03:00:24,640
And also gives other people a shot.

2493
03:00:25,580 --> 03:00:29,960
Even though I appreciate every single one of you and
everybody who...

2494
03:00:29,960 --> 03:00:30,980
I never win.

2495
03:00:31,100 --> 03:00:31,420

2499
03:00:43,700 --> 03:00:46,480
So, Manti, I can't tell what you're...

2500
03:00:46,480 --> 03:00:53,140
Wait, Manti, can you post your profile picture under the
Minto Live hashtag and I'll just get it from there?

2501
03:00:58,860 --> 03:01:00,180
Oh, it looks like a VTuber.

2502
03:01:02,560 --> 03:01:03,600

2505
03:01:05,560 --> 03:01:07,060
My chat is so slow.

2506
03:01:07,200 --> 03:01:08,200
I don't know what's going on.

2507
03:01:08,360 --> 03:01:08,940
I think it's YouTube.

2508
03:01:10,740 --> 03:01:11,860
Maybe I should refresh.

2509
03:01:16,560 --> 03:01:17,300
Refresh

2510
03:01:21,870 --> 03:01:23,890

03:02:05,600 --> 03:02:08,880
I'm looking at everything that's in the file.

2514
03:02:11,490 --> 03:02:13,550
The live tag and it's so cursed.

2515
03:02:15,510 --> 03:02:17,010
Oh my gosh.

2516
03:02:20,250 --> 03:02:21,270

Oh, I think it's fixed now.

2518
03:02:22,550 --> 03:02:23,490
I think it's fixed.

2519
03:02:24,870 --> 03:02:25,890
I think it's fixed now.

2520
03:02:26,030 --> 03:02:26,910
I think it's fixed.

2521
03:02:29,090 --> 03:02:30,610
Also, Maple, why did you...

2522
03:02:30,610 --> 03:02:31,450

03:02:38,690 --> 03:02:40,610
Is it okay if I... I'm just gonna...

2527
03:02:40,610 --> 03:02:41,910
I'm gonna put it on the screen.

2528
03:02:42,210 --> 03:02:42,810
I hope that's okay.

2529
03:02:47,390 --> 03:02:49,110
So that I can have a reference.

2530
03:02:49,490 --> 03:02:50,850
Easy to see reference.

2531
03:02:51,490 --> 03:02:52,530
Maple, why'd you draw?

2532
03:02:52,890 --> 03:02:54,730
Why'd you draw yourself as...

2533
03:02:54,730 --> 03:02:56,130
as... with a... with a...

2534
03:02:56,130 --> 03:02:58,210
You maybe!

2535
03:02:58,390 --> 03:02:58,950
Thanks for the raid!

2536
03:02:59,090 --> 03:02:59,470

Hello!

2539
03:03:02,050 --> 03:03:02,770
Hello everybody!

2540
03:03:03,330 --> 03:03:03,890

2542
03:03:11,970 --> 03:03:13,270
Oh, he lost one ear.

2543
03:03:15,850 --> 03:03:16,570
All right.

2544
03:03:17,470 --> 03:03:19,610
Why are there so many people raiding me?

2545
03:03:20,250 --> 03:03:21,190
What's going on?

2546
03:03:25,250 --> 03:03:26,670
Thank you for the raid!

2547
03:03:27,050 --> 03:03:27,270
Hello!

2548
03:03:27,950 --> 03:03:29,030
What is going on?

2549
03:03:29,110 --> 03:03:30,390
Why are there so many people raiding me?

2550
03:03:37,200 --> 03:03:38,000
What's happening?

2551
03:03:45,630 --> 03:03:47,390
I'm in my popular fangs?

2552
03:03:48,670 --> 03:03:49,070
What?

2553
03:03:53,090 --> 03:03:54,750
Okay, there we go.

2554
03:03:56,390 --> 03:03:57,850
Big and bulbous.

2555
03:03:59,450 --> 03:04:02,110
For anybody coming in, I'm drawing profile pictures.

2556
03:04:04,050 --> 03:04:04,990
nothing too fancy.

2557
03:04:05,090 --> 03:04:06,350
We're just kind of chit-chatting.

2558
03:04:06,490 --> 03:04:07,450
We're just hanging out.

2559
03:04:07,830 --> 03:04:08,410
Hey, I'm dragon.

2560
03:04:08,490 --> 03:04:09,570
Thanks for the tank of tits.

2561
03:04:09,630 --> 03:04:10,050
Hey, don't try.

2562
03:04:10,130 --> 03:04:10,990
Thanks for the tank of tits.

2563
03:04:11,310 --> 03:04:12,290
Thank you guys!

2564
03:04:12,630 --> 03:04:13,270
Thank you!

2565
03:04:13,770 --> 03:04:15,210
Thank you so much!

2566
03:04:15,470 --> 03:04:16,770
Thank you!

2567
03:04:18,190 --> 03:04:19,570
Oh, perfect.

2568
03:04:30,080 --> 03:04:33,200
First, we'll start off with our cat.

2569
03:04:34,080 --> 03:04:34,920
Our waspspspspspspsps.

2570
03:04:36,060 --> 03:04:39,940
And then you got a little hat, so I definitely want to draw
that.

2571
03:04:42,540 --> 03:04:43,000
You got...

2572
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:44,320
Oh, and the hair ribbon too.

2573
03:04:49,190 --> 03:04:50,650
I'll draw the hair ribbon.

2574
03:04:51,290 --> 03:04:52,970
It does kind of look like a toho.

2575
03:04:59,410 --> 03:05:00,810
Art by mint.

2576
03:05:01,390 --> 03:05:01,710
That's me.

2577
03:05:01,990 --> 03:05:02,690
That's my name.

2578
03:05:03,450 --> 03:05:04,030
My name's mint.

2579
03:05:04,790 --> 03:05:05,730
I'm minto.

2580
03:05:06,650 --> 03:05:07,310
That's my name.

2581
03:05:07,390 --> 03:05:08,970
Don't wear it out.

2582
03:05:11,070 --> 03:05:11,950
And the hat.

2583
03:05:31,980 --> 03:05:33,680
I'm so concentrated.

2584
03:05:33,860 --> 03:05:33,980
Okay.

2585
03:05:35,380 --> 03:05:36,120
Alright.

2586
03:05:37,400 --> 03:05:38,380
Very good.

2587
03:05:39,080 --> 03:05:40,400
Amazing artwork there.

2588
03:05:42,180 --> 03:05:43,620
Stop it.

2589
03:05:43,920 --> 03:05:46,120
You're just trying to flatter me.

2590
03:05:48,340 --> 03:05:49,720
You're just trying to...

2591
03:05:49,720 --> 03:05:52,680
You're just trying to make me feel good.

2592
03:05:54,160 --> 03:05:57,200
Bustin, busting, busting, busting, busting, busting,
busting!

2593
03:05:58,020 --> 03:05:58,840
Busting, busting, busting, busting!

2594
03:05:59,920 --> 03:06:00,280
Busting!

2595
03:06:00,280 --> 03:06:02,040
Busting makes me feel good.

2596
03:06:10,600 --> 03:06:11,320
Oh wait.

2597
03:06:11,740 --> 03:06:13,840
I was like, why is it acting weird?

2598
03:06:13,980 --> 03:06:14,320
There we go.

2599
03:06:15,100 --> 03:06:15,960
There we go.

2600
03:06:17,580 --> 03:06:19,160
Look at this cute little guy.

2601
03:06:19,660 --> 03:06:20,560
He's so precious.

2602
03:06:20,980 --> 03:06:22,160
He's so innocent.

2603
03:06:23,600 --> 03:06:24,520
Never a bad thought.

2604
03:06:24,660 --> 03:06:25,740
Only good thoughts.

2605
03:06:26,340 --> 03:06:27,140
Oh wait, this is the ears.

2606
03:06:28,520 --> 03:06:29,900
Only good thoughts.

2607
03:06:30,140 --> 03:06:31,320
Never bad thoughts.

2608
03:06:32,560 --> 03:06:33,740
Never weird thoughts.

2609
03:06:35,300 --> 03:06:38,060
Wisps are good and don't have weird thoughts.

2610
03:06:47,620 --> 03:06:48,660
And welcome to membership.

2611
03:06:49,160 --> 03:06:50,200
Thank you so much!

2612
03:06:51,080 --> 03:06:52,320
Yeah, you're normal.

2613
03:06:52,540 --> 03:06:53,220
You're normal.

2614
03:06:54,400 --> 03:06:55,580
You're so normal.

2615
03:06:55,940 --> 03:06:56,960
You're totally normal.

2616
03:07:00,720 --> 03:07:01,380
Right, Chet.

2617
03:07:02,640 --> 03:07:03,340
You're normal.

2618
03:07:05,600 --> 03:07:07,700
What was that voice that came out of me?

2619
03:07:09,320 --> 03:07:11,440
I think I am a demon sometimes.

2620
03:07:15,600 --> 03:07:16,500
And the...

2621
03:07:18,920 --> 03:07:20,440
I'm going to make the hot blue.

2622
03:07:24,400 --> 03:07:26,240
Blue, blue, blue.

2623
03:07:33,760 --> 03:07:34,960
And the ribbon too.

2624
03:07:40,330 --> 03:07:41,050
I'm blue.

2625
03:07:41,850 --> 03:07:43,230
Double-dee, double-dee.

2626
03:07:44,110 --> 03:07:45,110
Double-dee, double-dee.

2627
03:07:45,970 --> 03:07:46,470
I'm blue.

2628
03:07:46,830 --> 03:07:48,090
Double-dee, double-dee.

2629
03:07:48,690 --> 03:07:50,130
Double-dee.

2630
03:07:54,100 --> 03:07:57,220
I'm starting to get really hungry, so it's hard for me to
think.

2631
03:07:59,360 --> 03:08:05,860
So I apologize for any brain cells lacking in this moment.

2632
03:08:09,460 --> 03:08:11,620
Your art is very amazing and unique and I love it.

2633
03:08:11,760 --> 03:08:12,340
Thank you, Ben.

2634
03:08:14,040 --> 03:08:14,520
Really?

2635
03:08:14,780 --> 03:08:16,080
Well, you don't have to be so nice.

2636
03:08:16,260 --> 03:08:16,740
Come on.

2637
03:08:18,960 --> 03:08:23,940
I think when someone is just like, your art is unique.

2638
03:08:24,700 --> 03:08:26,280
Usually it's like not a compliment.

2639
03:08:28,180 --> 03:08:30,040
But I appreciate it.

2640
03:08:30,060 --> 03:08:30,960
Thank you.

2641
03:08:33,480 --> 03:08:35,140
Yeah, your art is...

2642
03:08:36,940 --> 03:08:38,780
It's unique.

2643
03:08:39,600 --> 03:08:41,400
It's unconventional.

2644
03:08:42,380 --> 03:08:44,960
I call it bold and brash.

2645
03:08:45,740 --> 03:08:46,920
Picasso moment.

2646
03:08:47,220 --> 03:08:47,820
For real.

2647
03:08:48,800 --> 03:08:49,780
Picasso real.

2648
03:08:50,480 --> 03:08:51,220
Mint Picasso.

2649
03:08:51,720 --> 03:08:52,940
I'm not Domingue.

2650
03:08:53,300 --> 03:08:54,240
I'm mint Picasso.

2651
03:08:56,240 --> 03:08:57,140
That's me.

2652
03:08:58,180 --> 03:08:59,120
Mint castle.

2653
03:09:00,540 --> 03:09:01,060
Castle.

2654
03:09:05,700 --> 03:09:06,740
Mint castle.

2655
03:09:15,150 --> 03:09:16,970
Thank you, Mint, let us be nice to you.

2656
03:09:19,170 --> 03:09:20,590
I don't accept compliments.

2657
03:09:23,750 --> 03:09:30,630
I'm gonna, it doesn't have, usually I'm gonna give it, I'm
gonna give it the front hair a little bit.

2658
03:09:31,230 --> 03:09:32,410
Kind of like a little bit of fringe.

2659
03:09:37,130 --> 03:09:37,750
Cute.

2660
03:09:38,710 --> 03:09:39,330
And a ponytail.

2661
03:09:41,410 --> 03:09:41,670
Yeah.

2662
03:09:43,970 --> 03:09:45,330
Maybe not the ponytail.

2663
03:09:46,090 --> 03:09:47,790
Kind of looks like a...

2664
03:09:47,790 --> 03:09:50,870
Kind of looks like, you know, your uncle's...

2665
03:09:50,870 --> 03:09:52,110
Your uncle's rat tail.

2666
03:09:53,820 --> 03:09:56,650
Looks like your uncle's rat tail a little bit.

2667
03:09:59,910 --> 03:10:01,090
There we go.

2668
03:10:02,210 --> 03:10:04,110
There we go, I think.

2669
03:10:06,230 --> 03:10:17,590
perhaps that is good speaking from experience I don't know
if my oh actually I think one of I had several uncles I

2670
03:10:17,590 --> 03:10:27,910
think one of them had a rat tail yeah because uh a couple of
my uncles were in a biker gang so I think one of them had a

2671
03:10:27,910 --> 03:10:30,170
rat tail when he was in the gang

2672
03:10:34,030 --> 03:10:39,290
um Um, okay, let me write your name.

2673
03:10:41,330 --> 03:10:42,370
Manti Rose.

2674
03:10:45,450 --> 03:10:46,790
And your QOC.

2675
03:11:00,200 --> 03:11:02,120
And I'm sorry, I'm going to delete your OC.

2676
03:11:04,100 --> 03:11:04,760
There you go.

2677
03:11:05,520 --> 03:11:06,760
There you go.

2678
03:11:07,260 --> 03:11:08,820
Grandma's side of the family, maybe.

2679
03:11:08,980 --> 03:11:09,320
No.

2680
03:11:09,920 --> 03:11:11,320
The other side of the family.

2681
03:11:13,400 --> 03:11:14,680
The other side.

2682
03:11:17,640 --> 03:11:24,900

Oh, yes, the sack of Rome.

2687
03:11:55,330 --> 03:11:56,490
I recall the head pat.

2688
03:12:01,670 --> 03:12:02,950
Thank you, Mampi.

2689
03:12:03,090 --> 03:12:04,030
I hope you saved it.

2690
03:12:04,090 --> 03:12:05,330
If not, get it in the VOD.

2691
03:12:09,170 --> 03:12:09,650
Yep.

2692
03:12:11,450 --> 03:12:11,930
Alrighty.

2693
03:12:13,010 --> 03:12:14,910
And let's do one last one.

2694
03:12:18,330 --> 03:12:18,370
Okay.

2695
03:12:18,390 --> 03:12:20,490
Mint is my sack of the Roman Empire.

2696
03:12:20,990 --> 03:12:22,290
What does that mean?

2697
03:12:24,050 --> 03:12:25,790
What does the sack of the Roman Empire?

2698
03:12:26,590 --> 03:12:26,810
Oh!

2699
03:12:30,570 --> 03:12:32,830
Our winner is...

2700
03:12:35,250 --> 03:12:35,850
Sideways!

2701
03:12:37,690 --> 03:12:38,150
Congrats!

2702
03:12:41,330 --> 03:12:42,570
Congrats, congrats!

2703
03:12:42,870 --> 03:12:43,830
What did you ask for?

2704
03:12:50,110 --> 03:12:51,070
Let's go!

2705
03:12:52,830 --> 03:12:57,950
Uh, nothing specifically, but have fun with it.

2706
03:12:58,030 --> 03:12:58,750
Love you, Minto!

2707
03:12:59,690 --> 03:13:03,010
Well, you're here, I saw you, so is there anything you want
for real?

2708
03:13:06,290 --> 03:13:08,710
Do you often think about the Roman Empire, Mint?

2709
03:13:08,790 --> 03:13:10,490
I honestly think about the Romans a lot.

2710
03:13:11,050 --> 03:13:17,490
I think about the Roman Empire more now because people
started thinking about the Roman, or started talking about

2711
03:13:17,490 --> 03:13:18,210
the Roman Empire.

2712
03:13:18,390 --> 03:13:23,930
I think you can't say your Roman Empire anymore because
people are always thinking about the Roman Empire now

2713
03:13:23,930 --> 03:13:29,230
because Because they're always talking saying this is my
Roman Empire

2714
03:13:39,940 --> 03:13:45,760
It's too suggested now can I have a red 2002 Mazda Miata
with your ribbon on it

2715
03:13:49,720 --> 03:13:55,780
I got you I got you not the Miata

2716
03:14:00,180 --> 03:14:01,780
Not the miata.

2717
03:14:11,440 --> 03:14:11,720
Okay.

2718
03:14:12,580 --> 03:14:13,540
This is the one, right?

2719
03:14:14,280 --> 03:14:16,000
So whoever is car this is?

2720
03:14:17,060 --> 03:14:22,040
Uh, thank you for allowing me to use it for my commercial
use.

2721
03:14:22,560 --> 03:14:27,460
Um, actually I'm going to make it a little bit smaller so
that you can screenshot it more easily.

2722
03:14:28,060 --> 03:14:29,420
Okay, so first...

2723
03:14:37,400 --> 03:14:38,320
There we go.

2724
03:14:38,340 --> 03:14:43,340
Alright, we're gonna We're gonna do this

2725
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:49,260
We're gonna put me on the car

2726
03:14:53,900 --> 03:15:04,880
We're gonna wrap me on Actually, maybe I should be the other
way Gonna put Yeah, Itasha time, baby We're gonna put me on

2727
03:15:04,880 --> 03:15:14,220
the car Yeah, it's gonna be Actually, no, it doesn't have to
be sideways Just be multiple of me.

2728
03:15:15,120 --> 03:15:19,800
It can be many of me.

2729
03:15:25,060 --> 03:15:27,440
Multiple, multiple minto.

2730
03:15:28,240 --> 03:15:28,740
Okay, hold on.

2731
03:15:28,820 --> 03:15:31,040
I do have to do this, though.

2732
03:15:36,300 --> 03:15:37,680
Gotta pimp that ride.

2733
03:15:38,080 --> 03:15:38,220
Yeah.

2734
03:15:39,560 --> 03:15:42,040
Actually, for this one, we'll have one here.

2735
03:15:42,820 --> 03:15:43,160
Hold on.

2736
03:15:43,280 --> 03:15:50,400
gonna make it transparent first and then we'll have this one
here but flipped

2737
03:15:54,040 --> 03:16:13,560
that scared me but flipped oh there we go nice okay so four
minto on a car four minto on a car just like this okay now

2738
03:16:13,560 --> 03:16:17,320
we erase Which is the first Minto?

2739
03:16:18,180 --> 03:16:19,940
Wait, which is the original?

2740
03:16:20,200 --> 03:16:22,500
Okay, you're not the original, but we'll take it.

2741
03:16:24,540 --> 03:16:29,100
So the reason we're see-through is so that I can just kind
of...

2742
03:16:30,780 --> 03:16:31,860
Minto sisters?

2743
03:16:32,780 --> 03:16:33,460
Are they single?

2744
03:16:33,640 --> 03:16:35,540
Asking for a Frened?

2745
03:16:37,860 --> 03:16:43,440
I think Frened should have enough courage to ask for
themselves.

2746
03:16:44,840 --> 03:16:45,680
Just saying.

2747
03:16:47,240 --> 03:16:49,080
I'm actually considering doing them, by the way.

2748
03:16:49,740 --> 03:16:51,160
Kind of sort of abandoned my old project.

2749
03:16:51,280 --> 03:16:52,880
And a miata is smaller and cheaper.

2750
03:16:55,940 --> 03:16:58,140
Don't worry, I haven't forgotten the headband.

2751
03:16:58,700 --> 03:16:59,800
But why red on it?

2752
03:16:59,880 --> 03:17:01,560
Why I'm not red at all.

2753
03:17:03,400 --> 03:17:04,580
I'm not red at all.

2754
03:17:12,210 --> 03:17:13,470
I wouldn't match.

2755
03:17:14,350 --> 03:17:16,050
Red for the rage inside you.

2756
03:17:21,620 --> 03:17:22,640
Actually, hold on.

2757
03:17:23,240 --> 03:17:25,320
I'm gonna take a picture just for this.

2758
03:17:30,570 --> 03:17:31,210
Okay.

2759
03:17:34,210 --> 03:17:35,850
Just for this, just for this Itasha.

2760
03:17:38,610 --> 03:17:39,250
Okay.

2761
03:17:40,350 --> 03:17:41,350
Save image.

2762
03:17:44,170 --> 03:17:44,330
Okay.

2763
03:17:45,910 --> 03:17:47,610
Now the red will match.

2764
03:17:51,870 --> 03:17:54,610
Now the, now the red will match.

2765
03:17:55,470 --> 03:17:57,350
Sorry if it's not flushed, by the way.

2766
03:17:57,910 --> 03:17:59,750
I'm doing my best.

2767
03:18:02,810 --> 03:18:03,990
I'm doing my best.

2768
03:18:04,630 --> 03:18:05,870
My minto besto.

2769
03:18:07,610 --> 03:18:08,470
Ganba minto.

2770
03:18:09,750 --> 03:18:10,590
Oh, not that one.

2771
03:18:13,670 --> 03:18:14,350
Is it this one?

2772
03:18:16,870 --> 03:18:17,090
Yep.

2773
03:18:23,630 --> 03:18:24,790
Wait, I messed up.

2774
03:18:24,970 --> 03:18:25,470
Okay, hold on.

2775
03:18:25,850 --> 03:18:26,930
These need to be more...

2776
03:18:27,030 --> 03:18:28,610
Hmm, how do I do this?

2777
03:18:30,490 --> 03:18:34,030
Right now, they're kind of conjoined twins, but that's okay.

2778
03:18:35,970 --> 03:18:37,910
One can be higher and one can be...

2779
03:18:37,910 --> 03:18:39,170
Oh, like that, like that, like that.

2780
03:18:39,710 --> 03:18:41,690
One can be higher and one can be lower.

2781
03:18:43,270 --> 03:18:44,010
Just like that.

2782
03:18:50,340 --> 03:18:51,360
Oh, wait, wrong one.

2783
03:18:51,740 --> 03:18:52,100
This one.

2784
03:18:52,420 --> 03:18:52,900
There we go.

2785
03:18:57,370 --> 03:18:59,890
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

2786
03:19:03,030 --> 03:19:07,530
I don't expect anybody to ever make an Itasha out of me, but
it would be very cool to see.

2787
03:19:08,430 --> 03:19:12,430
I love seeing Itasha.

2788
03:19:17,410 --> 03:19:20,750
So, you know, not that I'm expecting it or anything.

2789
03:19:21,250 --> 03:19:21,910
I'm just saying.

2790
03:19:22,490 --> 03:19:31,710
If you decide to, if you're like, I want to make an Itasha
of someone, a certain ghost maid would be super enthused

2791
03:19:31,710 --> 03:19:32,890
about the idea.

2792
03:19:34,550 --> 03:19:54,930
I'm just saying someone of my of me my my my personality
would be very excited it's just the hood for this one by the

2793
03:19:54,930 --> 03:20:01,630
way it's just the hood I see I see I see I see

2794
03:20:18,920 --> 03:20:33,060
why can't i get this why is it going so much why is it like
so janky why is it so lumpy oh what's going on what's

2795
03:20:33,060 --> 03:20:34,820
happening stop stop

2796
03:20:38,340 --> 03:20:44,960
okay oh my gosh eraser too big I don't think it's the
eraser's fault.

2797
03:20:45,180 --> 03:20:50,740
It's like, it's like, when I do it, it's, first of all, it's
like, look at that.

2798
03:20:50,960 --> 03:20:53,700
Look at the size of the eraser, but that's all it does.

2799
03:20:53,980 --> 03:20:55,000
It's that tiny amount.

2800
03:20:57,100 --> 03:21:00,920
And then I think it's like not, it's like making it not very
smooth.

2801
03:21:01,060 --> 03:21:02,800
Oh, smoothing is off, that's why.

2802
03:21:06,380 --> 03:21:08,740
Maybe I just needed smoothing on a little bit more.

2803
03:21:08,800 --> 03:21:11,440
But it's hard to tell where, hmm.

2804
03:21:14,700 --> 03:21:15,980
Yamato, please!

2805
03:21:17,880 --> 03:21:18,800
Don't do it my best.

2806
03:21:19,020 --> 03:21:19,660
No one will notice.

2807
03:21:19,780 --> 03:21:21,180
Your profile picture will be too small.

2808
03:21:22,680 --> 03:21:23,440
Okay, that's one.

2809
03:21:25,880 --> 03:21:30,060
Sorry, I'm like so focused on this.

2810
03:21:30,220 --> 03:21:31,220
I'm barely reading chat.

2811
03:21:41,770 --> 03:21:43,650
Oh wait, now the smoothing's at 100.

2812
03:21:43,910 --> 03:21:46,450
No, no, I turned it off so I can do this quickly.

2813
03:21:47,410 --> 03:21:47,530
Okay.

2814
03:21:48,130 --> 03:21:48,850
There we go.

2815
03:21:50,810 --> 03:21:51,230

2818
03:22:00,690 --> 03:22:01,330
No.

2819
03:22:02,070 --> 03:22:02,610

2820
03:22:03,710 --> 03:22:03,990

03:22:13,150 --> 03:22:14,690
Dispose of the bodies.

2826
03:22:16,270 --> 03:22:18,690
Oh, what happened to my body?

2827
03:22:19,790 --> 03:22:20,890
I don't know, actually.

2828
03:22:21,730 --> 03:22:22,350
Kind of freaky.

2829
03:22:23,050 --> 03:22:25,030

03:22:46,260 --> 03:22:49,820
Get rid of the bodies.

2837
03:22:50,880 --> 03:22:53,420

03:23:49,670 --> 03:23:51,090

2846
03:23:56,230 --> 03:23:57,610

Oh, no, wait!

2873
03:27:16,260 --> 03:27:17,440

2875
03:27:29,060 --> 03:27:30,140

Get out of here.

2881
03:28:14,520 --> 03:28:15,900
Oh, and then of course the headband.

2882
03:28:16,060 --> 03:28:16,920
Don't worry, I haven't forgotten.

2883
03:28:17,360 --> 03:28:18,920
I'll probably forget later.

2884
03:28:19,880 --> 03:28:21,100
I'll probably forget later.

2885
03:28:21,480 --> 03:28:22,960
Please remind me if I forget.

2886
03:28:23,420 --> 03:28:23,860
Actually, no.

2887
03:28:24,320 --> 03:28:25,030
I'll do it right now.

2888
03:28:26,860 --> 03:28:28,620
I just don't remember where I have it saved.

2889
03:28:31,700 --> 03:28:35,140
I don't remember where I saved it.

2890
03:28:36,960 --> 03:28:37,420
I...

2891
03:28:44,500 --> 03:28:49,540
I don't know where it is.

2892
03:28:50,300 --> 03:28:51,400
Oh, I have it.

2893
03:29:01,070 --> 03:29:03,850
But let's hide it for now so I can take care of this part.

2894
03:29:05,650 --> 03:29:06,030
Okay.

2895
03:29:07,530 --> 03:29:07,790
Whoa!

2896
03:29:08,910 --> 03:29:09,510
Sorry.

2897
03:29:10,050 --> 03:29:10,750
Scared me.

2898
03:29:13,330 --> 03:29:17,930
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2899
03:29:32,230 --> 03:29:35,210
I can't tell where the windshield begins and

2900
03:29:38,830 --> 03:29:40,850
I think this is correct.

2901
03:29:43,930 --> 03:29:45,330
It's going to be a little cut off.

2902
03:29:45,490 --> 03:29:48,150
You won't see my dashing smile, but that's okay.

2903
03:29:50,050 --> 03:29:50,510
That's okay.

2904
03:30:09,220 --> 03:30:12,540
Does the car gain an immense ghost powers?

2905
03:30:19,260 --> 03:30:22,160
It actually sounds like that when you drive it.

2906
03:30:25,120 --> 03:30:26,120
Everybody in the...

2907
03:30:26,120 --> 03:30:27,760
You know how like there's some cars that are like...

2908
03:30:27,760 --> 03:30:35,420
they have like they make so much noise they're like this one
everybody will know they'll be like wow they're driving the

2909
03:30:35,420 --> 03:30:36,260
mint miata

2910
03:30:47,820 --> 03:30:54,420
you can hear it everywhere the mint miata no one is safe

2911
03:31:02,130 --> 03:31:04,430
I can't tell if this is part of the windshield or not.

2912
03:31:06,330 --> 03:31:07,810
So I'm just going to do it like that.

2913
03:31:16,080 --> 03:31:17,400
And then the headband.

2914
03:31:21,860 --> 03:31:24,240
The radio plays exclusively Busted.

2915
03:31:25,600 --> 03:31:30,860
When you honk the horn, it goes, B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Bustin,
B-B-B-B-Bustin.

2916
03:31:35,560 --> 03:31:37,500
How are we feeling, ladies?

2917
03:31:37,760 --> 03:31:38,660
How are we feeling?

2918
03:31:39,280 --> 03:31:39,800
All right, hold on.

2919
03:31:40,000 --> 03:31:40,760
One more thing.

2920
03:31:41,260 --> 03:31:43,180
I'm going to draw you two sideways.

2921
03:31:57,560 --> 03:31:58,540
There you are.

2922
03:32:00,980 --> 03:32:03,600
And, um, where should I write your name?

2923
03:32:12,870 --> 03:32:13,410
2013.

2924
03:32:17,550 --> 03:32:17,930
2013.

2925
03:32:20,290 --> 03:32:20,830
Yeah!

2926
03:32:22,050 --> 03:32:23,590
Not even sideways.

2927
03:32:26,090 --> 03:32:26,970
You're right.

2928
03:32:28,850 --> 03:32:29,730
You're right.

2929
03:32:31,710 --> 03:32:32,370
It's okay.

2930
03:32:33,530 --> 03:32:35,610
I don't want him to look like he's dead on the ground, you
know?

2931
03:32:36,130 --> 03:32:37,650
Rotate it by 90 degrees.

2932
03:32:38,850 --> 03:32:39,670
But then the name.

2933
03:32:39,790 --> 03:32:41,110
I'll have to redo the name, too.

2934
03:32:54,320 --> 03:32:55,040
There we go.

2935
03:33:12,160 --> 03:33:15,340
And let me zoom in so you can screenshot.

2936
03:33:17,840 --> 03:33:23,560
Oh, uh, uh, once again, there we go.

2937
03:33:26,240 --> 03:33:27,180
I'll move out of the way.

2938

2939
03:33:29,780 --> 03:33:30,700

The mint miata.

2943
03:33:39,340 --> 03:33:39,900
Mintata.

2944
03:33:40,680 --> 03:33:40,900
No.

2945
03:33:42,720 --> 03:33:44,220
That sounds icky.

2946
03:33:46,620 --> 03:33:48,440
Okay, thank you, Minto.

2947
03:33:48,940 --> 03:33:49,680
You're welcome!

2948
03:33:53,360 --> 03:33:55,860
You are so welcome.

2949
03:33:59,420 --> 03:34:00,940
It almost looks legit.

2950
03:34:01,520 --> 03:34:03,440
It almost looks convincing, I'd say.

2951
03:34:04,080 --> 03:34:04,460
Oh, wait.

2952
03:34:04,900 --> 03:34:07,520

2953
03:34:11,360 --> 03:34:12,060
Wait.

2954
03:34:14,920 --> 03:34:17,080

Oh my gosh, sideways, please.

2978
03:36:05,770 --> 03:36:07,050
I don't deserve that, Akasupa.

2979
03:36:08,050 --> 03:36:08,910
I messed up.

2980
03:36:08,910 --> 03:36:09,850
I messed up bad.

2981
03:36:10,110 --> 03:36:12,970
I was looking at this part right here, this tiny bitty bit.

2982
03:36:14,150 --> 03:36:15,070
I was like, oh, you're right.

2983
03:36:15,190 --> 03:36:16,210
It does kind of stick out.

2984
03:36:18,430 --> 03:36:19,610
So I'll fix it.

2985
03:36:22,590 --> 03:36:28,810
Okay, now it should be third times the charm.

2986
03:36:29,670 --> 03:36:31,030
Wait, third times the charm.

2987
03:36:39,470 --> 03:36:40,350
There you go.

2988
03:36:40,750 --> 03:36:42,310
There you go.

2989
03:36:42,830 --> 03:36:43,870
Okay, thank you.

2990
03:36:44,390 --> 03:36:45,770
Oh my gosh, I can't believe I missed that.

2991
03:36:45,830 --> 03:36:46,630
That's so embarrassing.

2992
03:36:47,730 --> 03:36:49,330
I'm going to think about that for the rest of my afterlife.

2993
03:36:51,990 --> 03:36:54,250
I'm going to think about that for the rest of my afterlife.

2994
03:36:57,210 --> 03:37:01,050
Oh, tiny bit near the front headlight.

2995
03:37:02,790 --> 03:37:03,970
Wait, do you mean this part?

2996
03:37:04,510 --> 03:37:06,050
Is that not just a shine on the car?

2997
03:37:13,990 --> 03:37:15,290
Fourth time's the charm.

2998
03:37:15,690 --> 03:37:16,090
Lucky number.

2999
03:37:16,990 --> 03:37:18,370
Spooky number four.

3000
03:37:18,970 --> 03:37:20,330
Spooky number four.

3001
03:37:25,250 --> 03:37:26,330
Ah, oh.

3002
03:37:27,390 --> 03:37:28,610
There we go.

3003
03:37:29,510 --> 03:37:29,890
Good job.

3004
03:37:35,580 --> 03:37:42,740
There's a bit of mint of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of
mint in the bottom left corner.

3005
03:37:42,880 --> 03:37:43,220
You know what?

3006
03:37:43,360 --> 03:37:43,780
It's dead.

3007
03:37:44,360 --> 03:37:45,180
The bit is dead.

3008
03:37:45,940 --> 03:37:49,800
The bit of mint is dead.

3009
03:37:51,480 --> 03:37:53,000
Where do you get your mints at?

3010
03:37:54,700 --> 03:37:56,660
Where do you get your mints printed?

3011
03:37:57,220 --> 03:37:58,000
Bogle's minted?

3012
03:38:01,040 --> 03:38:03,360
Well, guys, I think that was a good one to end on.

3013
03:38:04,320 --> 03:38:07,220
Like I said, this won't be the last time I do this.

3014
03:38:10,440 --> 03:38:14,100
Let me show you what my schedule is for next week.

3015
03:38:15,240 --> 03:38:16,480
Though, oh, whoops.

3016
03:38:17,280 --> 03:38:23,080
Though, I think it will probably change because...

3017
03:38:23,900 --> 03:38:24,600
Whoops, not that.

3018
03:38:25,260 --> 03:38:28,000
Because maybe I have to do something for 200K.

3019
03:38:28,280 --> 03:38:32,700
So take this with a grain of salt at the moment.

3020
03:38:34,120 --> 03:38:36,000
It's not totally complete.

3021
03:38:36,140 --> 03:38:37,600
It's maybe not accurate.

3022
03:38:41,720 --> 03:38:42,600
But, um...

3023
03:38:42,600 --> 03:38:46,080
I'll probably change...

3024
03:38:46,940 --> 03:38:50,780
Wait, Atlantis No Nazo can be my thing for 200k.

3025
03:38:53,540 --> 03:38:55,000
200k, Atlantis No Nazo!

3026
03:38:57,660 --> 03:38:59,120
Or is it Nazo No Atlantis?

3027
03:38:59,220 --> 03:38:59,340
Wait.

3028
03:39:00,040 --> 03:39:01,300
No, is Atlantis Noazo, right?

3029
03:39:01,980 --> 03:39:02,420
What?

3030
03:39:02,460 --> 03:39:03,440
Am I losing it right now?

3031
03:39:03,460 --> 03:39:04,060
I think I'm very tired.

3032
03:39:04,080 --> 03:39:16,440
tired because i'm hungry yeah so oh yeah i have a collab
with leah actually she asked me to send her some stuff for

3033
03:39:16,440 --> 03:39:28,980
it and i had to stream so um um yeah collabing with leah on
her channel so technically i won't be streaming on my

3034
03:39:28,980 --> 03:39:49,620
channel that day um and monday tomorrow the podcast and and
and Sunday I'm seeing my grandma so yes

3035
03:39:53,220 --> 03:39:58,840
yeah but like I said this might change a little bit because
oh and all the times are wrong so please don't look at the

3036
03:39:58,840 --> 03:40:06,480
times at the moment oh wait actually only ghost trick is
wrong what time did i have ghost trick for

3037
03:40:10,940 --> 03:40:23,020
uh oh ghost trick is actually a 6 p.m esg and atlantis no
naso is actually 2 p.m esg so it's just a little bit wrong

3038
03:40:23,020 --> 03:40:34,820
just a little bit wrong but yeah i hadn't fixed that yet i
need to i need to uh get a schedule with figma because i'm

3039
03:40:34,820 --> 03:40:36,720
so bad about changing the times.

3040
03:40:36,840 --> 03:40:38,240
It's my least favorite thing.

3041
03:40:40,080 --> 03:40:48,920
So I'll probably be commissioning a new schedule so that I
can use Figma again.

3042
03:40:51,100 --> 03:40:51,700
Okie dokie.

3043
