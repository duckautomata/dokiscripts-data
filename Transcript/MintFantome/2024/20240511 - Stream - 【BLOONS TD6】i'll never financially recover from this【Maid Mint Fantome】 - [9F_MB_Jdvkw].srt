1
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,990
Monkey time.

2
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,110
Monkey, monkey, monkey.

3
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:57,990
Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey monkey, monkey,
monkey.

4
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:01,970
Yeah!

5
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:09,670
This is the weirdest Bunny Girl Cafe I have ever seen.

6
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,990
You guys, I'm sorry.

7
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,010
Today on my schedule was...

8
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,030
Bunny Garden.

9
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,650
Whoa!

10
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,310
Whoa!

11
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,250
Why is a...

12
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,150
Why is Discord sending me stuff even though I have OBS open?

13
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,450
Huh?

14
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,410
Oh, I disabled streamer mode.

15
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,690
Matara!

16
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,770
She said this song appeared on my Spotify and it's from
Metal Gear Rising.

17
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,670
Yeah!

18
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,020
The game is quiet.

19
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,220
It is quiet.

20
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,220
Because, look at this.

21
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,320
I can't stand listening to the music in this game.

22
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,940
Yeah, the game itself will be louder though.

23
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,420
I was thinking actually maybe just putting on my own music.

24
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,080
Put it at max!

25
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,850
Yeah, I might do my own BGM.

26
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:29,870
We'll see how, you know, we get as we listen to it.

Hold on, I don't want Discord to message me again.

37
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,360
How do I turn the streamer mode back on?

38
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,320
Oh.

39
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,880
Streamer mode.

40
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,100
I don't know how to do it.

41
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,930
I'm just gonna exit out.

42
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,150
I'm just gonna leave.

43
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,570
Quit Discord.

44
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,670
Quit Discord.

45
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:23,990
Okay.

46
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,930
We're disconnecting for real.

47
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,750
Settings, app settings, streamer.

48
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,690
Thank you.

49
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,330
Yeah, W Hammer.

50
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,070
Honk.

51
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,550
Honk.

52
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,510
Did you guys notice we're on a different side of the screen?

53
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,490
Actually, I actually, I flipped my monitors.

54
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,950
So now, you guys are on the right side.

55
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,430
She'd be moving around.

56
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,610
I know, isn't it so exciting to...

57
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,050
to go to a different spot?

58
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,430
Why are you guys a clown emoji?

59
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,490
Why are you guys a clown emoji, huh?

60
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,450
And Draco, thanks for the 10 gifted, thank you.

61
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,470
Keep us on our toes, absolutely.

62
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,590
Absolutely, what was it?

63
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,010
W Hammer, can you post it again?

64
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,070
I lost it.

65
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:31,650
Wait, um.

66
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:34,930
Oh!

67
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,410
It's enabled already.

68
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,230
Never mind.

69
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,970
It's because I reopened or I got it.

70
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:41,730
We're good.

71
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,770
I think it's because I quit.

72
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,850
Settings, app settings too.

73
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,210
Thank you!

74
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,850
Even bazongas cannot overcome the urge to return to monkey.

75
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,490
Happy May Day to my favorite maid.

76
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,630
Thank you!

77
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:05,190
Yeah, I was like, maybe I should, uh, maybe I should like,
Play whatever I want because it is made day.

78
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:10,250
It's my day Actually, did you guys know that there's a minto
day?

79
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,530
Unfortunately, we missed it.

80
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:25,130
It's a March 10th, but it's me like three in Japanese is
three and then in Japanese 10 is can be read as toll.

81
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,370
So minto

82
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,980
Mario day

83
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,720
still in my gig.

84
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,700
No, it's a Minto day.

85
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,200
It's not Mario day.

86
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,300
Forget about Mario.

87
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,360
Don't listen to him.

88
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,740
Forget about Mario.

89
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,620
Forget about Mario.

90
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,380
Forget about Mario.

91
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,200
Forget about Mario.

92
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,780
Um.

93
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,720
You can see I've played a little bit.

94
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,720
Not so much though.

95
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,300
Oh, should we do the balloon?

96
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,980
But I've already done this one.

97
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,930
Happy late mint day.

98
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:08,910
Thanks.

99
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,990
Toes Day?

100
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,830
What do you mean by that, Hugo?

101
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,710
I can see the Aurora Borealis from my bedroom.

102
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:19,870
Wait, actually?

103
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,650
At this time of day.

104
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,310
I mean, at this time...

105
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,450
Wait.

106
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:33,830
All localized within the outsevere bedroom.

107
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,790
Sorry.

108
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,650
My brain is not working very well today.

109
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,390
I think my brain is, uh...

110
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,490
No, I saw some people talking about the Aurora Borealis
today, though.

111
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,910
Yeah, you got it.

112
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:50,750
It's the spirit.

113
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,610
It's the spirit.

114
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,650
Right?

115
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,430
It's the spirit.

116
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,610
I can never forget about Mario.

117
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,410
Can't believe Mint is broke after her time in the balloons
were.

118
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,130
Which one should we do, you guys?

119
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,750
We can do any of them.

120
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,490
Oh, this one's kind of spooky.

121
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,930
I love Spooky.

122
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,410
And it has a bonus reward.

123
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,150
Let's do this one.

124
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,410
I just really want to get off this menu.

125
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,410
I'm going to put everything to the same.

126
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:27,470
Yes?

127
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:28,430
Yes?

128
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,080
Yes?

129
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,440
Yes?

130
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,400
Why isn't it working?

131
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,280
Yes?

132
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,480
Yes?

133
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,060
Yes?

134
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,060
Yes?

135
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,920
Why is it a...

136
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,100
Yep.

137
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:57,690
Yep.

138
00:10:59,130 --> 00:10:59,890
Yeah.

139
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:01,970
Yes.

140
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,310
Oh!

141
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:03,350
Yes.

142
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:03,990
Yes.

143
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,930
Yes.

144
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:05,830
Yes.

145
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,790
You have to hold on to.

146
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:09,790
Yes.

147
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,910
Yes.

148
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:11,290
Yes.

149
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:11,530
Babe.

150
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:12,770
Butt cheeks.

151
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,770
Welcome to membership bag you.

152
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:16,990
Yes.

153
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,890
Yes.

154
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:22,530
Sir.

155
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:23,990
Yes.

156
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:24,890
Yes.

157
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:25,890
Yes.

158
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:26,970
Yes.

159
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:27,950
Yes.

160
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,450
Yes.

161
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:31,450
What?

162
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,190
That is so weird that you like hold on to it.

163
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:36,950
Yes.

164
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:37,950
Yes.

165
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,850
Uh, disclaimer.

166
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,990
I'm probably gonna play this a little poorly.

167
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,310
Um, I think there's also this monkey.

168
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,290
I have yet to unlock that monkey.

169
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,450
I don't even know what this monkey is.

170
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,230
I think when I was playing before, this monkey did not
exist.

171
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,210
And March 9th is Miku.

172
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,710
March 9th, thank you.

173
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,130

Thank you, thank you.

I thought you were a god gamer.

177
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:15,110
I am a YouTuber by No Perfect Gameplay.

178
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:21,990
Actually, Matara and I were recording the Patreon side of
the podcast today.

00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:31,970
like almost not just before this but um and uh i was like
man i really just want to play balloons we got actually like

180
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:39,450
really into talking about balloons even before we were
recording um but i was just like you know one thing that

in the exact way that like Bloons lover 777 put them in on

183
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:09,990
YouTube for the optimal Bloons gameplay, people are just

Boomerang Monkey.

00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,660
I have the crossbow master.

247
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,200
Oh, I can do the superfan.

248
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,180
Is this one any good, the superfan?

249
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,200
This monkey business is getting out of business.

250
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,120
Can the monkey business go out of business?

251
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,620
business I wonder it's

252
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:14,500
not meta but it sure is funny got it go juggernaut I was
like trying to it's it's slow though isn't it because this

253
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:22,940
one says it's a slower attacking spike a bolt so I was like
I love the spikes depends on the amount of dart monkeys ah

254
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:30,460
it says converts up to 10 nearby oh they gotta be dart
monkeys oh what if I have a whole field of only dart monkeys

255
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:35,680
but i do have crossbow masters so we'll go off we'll go for
that one oh

256
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,730
you guys i think we're in trouble

257
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:07,870
you fool oh we should give enough money for this guy oh okay

258
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:16,290

let's go for that one.

259
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,830
I also want the Red Hot Rangs.

260
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,380
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

261
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,060
The Spicy Rangs.

262
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,060

263
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,160

Nice.

265
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,200
Where should I put him, though?

266
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,600
This path is kind of difficult.

267
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,220
Because it's like...

268
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,280
It feels like it just...

269
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,400
Does every...

270
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,260
Anywhere I put it, anywhere I put a monkey doesn't cover
enough ground, you know what I mean?

271
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,560
Hey, mean toe.

272
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,820
I forgot that I had the room on my phone.

273
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,740
Got a big surprise while driving a client to his work.

274
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,180
Oopsie!

275
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,180
Your monkey placement is just as random and awesome as you
are.

276
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,540
Thanks, Zach.

277
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,880

00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,580
Here.

282
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,840
The spirits of the forest awakened.

283
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,320
Oh my god, it's so loud, it spook me.

284
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:45,680
Yes?

285
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,680

286
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:48,720

287
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,760
Yes?

288
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:51,760

295
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,280
Yes?

296
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,560
Yeah, attack them, attack them, attack them.

297
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:07,180
Yes?

298
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,260
Yes?

299
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,400
Ha ha!

300
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,980
What's the monkey that says yes?

301
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,890
I think I'll switch to him next time.

302
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,320
Quincy!

303
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,000
Satan!

304
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,880
He's not that bad, right?

305
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,960
It's my first time seeing this game.

306
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,900
Why do they all have Ike him in voice?

307
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,400
This only...

308
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,060
This guy is a wise monkey.

309
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:44,740
See?

310
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,240
I always read his name wrong, though.

311
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,040
O-B-Y-N, green foot.

312
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,180
Oh, that's a lot of blue.

313
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,080
Handle it.

314
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,250
You guys stop...

315
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:04,910
Wait, I thought...

316
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,070
Wait.

317
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:06,730
Target?

318
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,250
Target?

319
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,250
No, it's Oben.

320
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,510
You guys are...

321
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,910
Saying...

322
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:12,050
You guys...

323
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,270

324
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,760

325
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:44,300

gonna use them okay i'm gonna try some um some other monkeys

326
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,760
this guy also needs to level up as you see i have no nothing
for him

327
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,180
My goal is to get to level 100.

328
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,120
I think Balloons would win IRL.

329
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,860
That's where you're wrong.

330
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,260
That's where you're so wrong.

331
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,000
I read the game title as Balloon Tiddy 6.

332
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,920
So imagine my surprise when I open the stream.

333
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,240
Jonzi Poo, you just have...

334
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,200

337
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,160
You...

338
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,020
You have a Freudian slip.

00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,070

374
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,620
But I think if you had no hair, you could fit three faces on
yours.

375
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,860
Why are you so mean to me?

376
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,080

And my hair is jelly, apparently.

00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,070
It was like a clip of me or something, I think.

385
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:02,850
And they were like, wow, Vince's hair is just made of jello
or whatever.

386
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,870

00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,570

00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,030
Someone said 5-0-2.

396
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:57,810

404
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,750
What did you say?

405
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,210
I said you're a ninja.

406
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,150
You're a ninja.

407
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,210
That's in your name!

408
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:35,770
I think I've told this somewhat before, but you can change
the size of the cursor, etc.

409
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:36,830
by clicking hotkeys.

410
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,750
Extra large cursor!

411
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,170
Thank you.

412
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,310
Do you guys want to see my big finger?

413
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,930
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!

414
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,270
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!

415
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,870
Has the Dr. Stone hair?

416
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,850
No, Dr. Stone has my hair.

417
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,500
Where you're tickling?

418
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,120
Sorry, I didn't know that we were, you know...

419
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,660
Okay, let's do...

420
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,300
Hmm.

421
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,700
Let's do quick shots instead.

422
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,720
Very quick shot.

423
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,360
I feel like in this game, quick is most important, right?

424
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,420
We'll just keep collecting money.

425
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,700
This guy down here, this is Dart Monkey 7.

426
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,120
He's our backup support.

427
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,540
Gotta go fast.

428
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,820
I finally made a monkey.

429
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,600
You've made a monkey out of me.

430
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,520
You must be swift as the coursing river.

431
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,240
With all the strength of a great typhoon.

432
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:27,520
With all the speed of a ninja monkey Mysterious eyes The
dark side of the moon Be monkey

Any chance of karaoke of the man who sold the world?

438
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,460
I'd have to learn it, but I could do it.

439
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,600
I graduated college today.

monkeys do the work.

451
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,620
Yeah.

452
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,380

Okay.

456
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:30,820
This might be a little, you know, like premature, but I
think we got to start getting a farm.

457
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,940
Wait, where can I even put a farm in this map?

458
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,740
Oh my gosh.

459
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,080
A green day karaoke.

460
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,000
A Metal Gear Rising karaoke.

461
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,240
I am so nervous.

462
00:34:53,260 --> 00:35:07,760
nervous about that though because like I feel I feel oh yes

sing it well I can just sing it for fun right I thought this

464
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:27,340

only had monkey on the brain.

465
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,680
I'm really, really sorry.

466
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,560
I'm really sorry that I'm only thinking about monkey.

467
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,860
Oh, no!

468
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,540
Uh-oh.

469
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,160
Uh-oh.

470
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:37,820
Oh.

471
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,340
Um, you go.

Oh.

474
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,560
I thought we were doomed.

475
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
I thought we were doomed.

476
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,660

Okay, we'll get him.

I'll get enough money.

482
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,950
I only have monkey in the brain, so nothing changed.

483
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,390
The more things change, sometimes the more they stay the
same.

484
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:48,890
Right?

485
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:49,850
Happy May Day.

486
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,090
Happy May Day!

487
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,750
I really want...

488
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,190
Look at this.

489
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,810
We have lead and spikes.

490
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,340
Double shot.

491
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,000
Whoa!

492
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:06,800
Balloon!

493
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,540
Jutsu!

494
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:18,910
Did you guys ever wonder why we're on the right side of the
screen now?

495
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,610
Oh wait, I told you.

496
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,630
Never mind.

497
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,540
Sorry.

498
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,840
Actually, there's another reason.

499
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,940
Okay, and I'm just really excited.

500
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,320

More people join.

502
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:58,540
again there's another reason that you guys are on the right
side of the screen now instead of the left side of the

503
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:13,100
screen I asked earlier because usually I have my my chat
settings on the right side and and not chat settings not I

504
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:21,440
don't know why I said set settings my chat on the right side
or left side and me on the monitors so I moved all of us

505
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
over to the right side.

506
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,320

00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,220
There we go.

532
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:42,680
Okay.

533
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,400
See, you got some ghosts here.

534
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,440
Look at them.

535
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:51,560
They're just... I think this guy is... He's having, like, a
first date or something.

536
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,880
He looks really nervous.

537
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,060
You got this guy singing back there.

538
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,100
He's so cute.

539
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:03,540
Yeah, he's like, la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la la la la la.

540
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,840
And the bustin sign, of course, is still there.

541
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,360
Of course, it must always be there.

542
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,060
My play button!

543
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,480
Because I'm a real YouTuber.

544
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,220
I'm a real YouTuber.

545
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,640
So I have my play button in the background.

546
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,520
These guys, like, enjoying a hot cup of joe.

547
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,020
Yeah.

548
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,040
This guy's my favorite over here.

549
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,800
Just like chilling back there.

550
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,620
It's like...

551
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,940
And a little counter here.

552
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,740
Oh, and the stage.

553
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:39,660
Yeah.

554
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,790
That's it.

555
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:45,610
That's it!

556
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,990
Where did I go?

557
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:55,930
Oh, I'm down here.

558
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,570
Isn't it so cute?

559
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,610
Isn't it so cute?

560
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,390
So welcome to the new maid cafe!

00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,420
Why are we on the menu?

562
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,120
Because you're a snack.

563
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,550
Get off the stage.

564
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,630
I could be over there.

565
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,130
Oh, kairi nasaimasu, go chichinama.

566
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:51,710
Why is the chat going so fast?

567
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,470
What's happening?

568
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,550
Today is main day.

572
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:12,070

573
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,160
Monkey.

574
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,660
It's time for monkey!

575
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,720
Monkey time!

576
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:49,940
Monkey time!

577
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,200

578
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,360
Monkey time!

579
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,860
Break it down!

580
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:37,230
Why are you so tiny?

581
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,730
Thank you!

582
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,390
Thank you, thank you!

583
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,450
I want this as my ringtone.

584
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:54,150
Okay, let's get back to monkey business now.

585
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:57,270
Sorry, monkeys.

586
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,090
Oh, there goes the chat.

587
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:01,750
It's zooming.

588
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,960
No, I need funky monkey babies next.

589
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:13,900

590
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,260
I do know funky monkey babies.

00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,670
Oh, this one.

592
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:27,810
I usually do this one.

593
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,080
Incredible performance, it mesmerized me.

594
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,800

00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:07,260
Donkey!

603
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,400

00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:12,420
DDT!

605
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,420
I've never seen the BAD though.

00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,040
Big airship of Doom.

607
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,440
I don't think so at least.

608
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,360
Definitely seen the DDTs.

609
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,080

00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,140

611
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,660
When do the BADs come in?

00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,580
BADs at round 100.

613
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,140
Ah!

614
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,800
What do you mean a permit for those curtains?

615
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,430
Bionic boomerang

616
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,760
I'll do the faster one

617
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:09,600

cobwebs you guys

620
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,140
The curtains are so close to the candles.

621
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,300
No, they're not.

622
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:36,620
What?

623
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,660
No, they're not.

624
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,520
There's only one candle.

625
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,800
And it's...

626
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,020
It's...

627
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,360
It's this one.

628
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,060
But the curtains aren't even any close to it.

629
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,460
This one right here that I'm pointing to.

630
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,400
It's only candles.

631
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,640
I back off my cafe.

632
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:12,720
Okay.

633
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,140
Back, back, back.

634
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,000
You know what?

635
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,360
You don't deserve to be served here.

636
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,680
You come into my cafe for a stay in.

637
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,860

638
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,100
Oh, my curtains.

639
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,400
My curtains are too close to the candle.

640
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,240
Oh, my food.

641
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,140
Oh, no.

642
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,380
My food is made if it has ectoplasm.

643
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,600
Oh, the curtain is on fire.

644
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,080
Oh no, the cafe's on fire.

645
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,480

649
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,300
The manager.

650
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,220

00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,180

657
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,760
Uh-oh.

658
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,740
I became too small.

659
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,220
There we go.

660
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:00,700
Okay.

00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,500
Mint Reaction Corner.

662
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:05,900

663
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,020
Okay, guys.

664
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:08,500
Hey, guys.

665
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,620

00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,780
Let's play monkey game.

670
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,760
Live mint reaction.

671
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,560
It's like one of those Japanese TV shows.

672
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,720
You can't like see so much of it right down here though.

673
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,300
Are you really okay with that?

674
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:36,900
Oh!

675
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,740
Oh, we handled it.

676
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,360
Oh yeah, I keep forgetting to upgrade this guy too.

677
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,400
I was trying to make him rich.

678
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,940
I'll give him this one too.

679
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:55,440
Greetings, Minto.

680
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,800
Long time donator and first time viewer, patron of the Maid
Cafe.

681
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,880
I was burned by the molten chocolate dripping from the
curtains.

682
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:05,060
Can I get a discount on my meal as compensation?

683
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:23,640
I'm really sorry, but you signed the waiver when you came in
that says, I don't mind being burnt by the curtains.

684
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,600
The molten chocolate is part of the cafe experience.

685
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,120
Drunk C.S.

686
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,100
Lest.

687
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:35,200
Lest.

688
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,180
To my osu.

689
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:38,220
Go!

690
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,660
Don't drink and super chat.

691
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,080
Yeah, there's a waiver.

692
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,040
There's a waiver.

693
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:56,200
Monkey!

694
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,060
Monkey!

695
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,040
Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey.

696
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:13,250
This is the health inspector.

697
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:16,150
Oh my gosh, your binary ghost.

698
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:17,630
So you're actually the health inspector.

699
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,350
There have been reports of ectoplasm in the kitchen.

700
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:21,550
That's a violation.

701
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:23,570
Okay, everybody scatter.

702
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:25,130
Scatter.

703
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,540
You guys, I'm lost.

704
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,300
I don't know where I am.

705
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,720
I'm lost.

706
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:04,540
Wait.

707
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,900
I'm lost.

708
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:08,900
I'm lost.

709
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,040
I don't know where I am.

710
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,160
It's really dark here.

711
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,160
I'm lost.

712
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,460
Where am I?

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

715
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,520
I'm lost.

716
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:31,710
Hold on.

717

Hold on.

719
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:37,610
I'm lost.

720
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:42,010
This isn't supposed to be funny.

721
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:42,830
This isn't a bit.

722
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:44,610
I'm lost, for real.

723
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:46,570
I can't come back.

724
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:48,570
I can't come.

725
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:53,190
I'm clicking and dragging, but I don't know where I am.

726
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:54,590
I'm lost.

727
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:55,430

Oh, wait.

That's what I have.

749
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,220
It's...

750
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:01,100
It's the one with the big-ass mind.

751
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:18,990
So glad we played balloons today.

752
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,010
Look

753
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:37,290
at myself!

754
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:40,690
I can't...

755
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:45,070
I can't even...

756
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,640
Okay, anyway.

757
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,400
Let's bloom.

758
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:11,830
Wow, they just keep coming.

759
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:17,310
She's really into it.

760
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:19,690
I'm having a good time.

761
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:22,630
Oh, hold.

762
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:24,770
Actually, let me try something.

763
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:34,050
Fuck!

764
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:39,810
It worked!

765
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,280
Yippee!

766
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,640
Your other flew out the window.

767
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:05,620
Oh my goodness gracious That was a silly bit of a A little
bit

768
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:17,160
I'm gonna start bringing in Sniper Monkey It's my favorite
guy right here Sniper Monkey is my favorite guy Right here

769
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:22,800
What's the best place to put him though Hmm Hmm

770
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,510
Maybe here covers, no, up here.

771
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:33,310
Over, no, up here.

772
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:39,930
Snipe is a good job, mate.

773
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:42,950
Welcome back.

774
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:44,350
It's been like 10,000 years.

775
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:46,450
I can't believe I got lost.

776
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:50,650
Bottom right might be better.

777
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:53,450
Oh, oh, he's gone.

778
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:53,990
Wait, hold on.

779
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:55,770
Also, let me move me over a little bit.

780
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:56,610
There we go.

781
00:58:59,090 --> 00:58:59,710
I'm right.

782
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:01,050
No.

783
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:03,990
It covers like, it's because of the house.

784
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:06,570
I wish I could put him on top of the house, though.

785
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:08,530
Hmm.

786
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:12,130
Shouldn't have gone towards the light.

787
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:15,910
Where the dart monkey?

788
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:16,450
This one?

789
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:18,150
Yeah, I think you're right.

790
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:20,210
I think you're right.

791
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:22,710
We missed behind the car, but I think it'll be okay.

792
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,030
We'll put some other guys over here eventually.

793
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:28,990
I'm also going to add, um, okay, hold on.

794
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:29,930
How do I want to do this?

795
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:31,270
Because I do want to put a village.

796
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:32,910
Oh my goodness.

797
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,870
The village takes up so much space.

798
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,830
A 3D balloons game would be crazy.

799
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:45,210
Didn't you...

800
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,190
Didn't know you enjoyed these monkeys that much.

801
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:48,230
Just look at that smile.

802
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:52,770
I'm a monkey fiend.

803
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:56,470
I love balloons.

804
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:59,170
Gosh, this one's really hard to fit in though.

805
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,190
Yes, we can click on the car and remove it.

806
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:04,790
Actually, you know what?

807
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:06,230
We have enough money to get rid of it.

808
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,070
You just ran my monkey over!

809
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:12,610
Oh my god.

810
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:15,590
Oh my gosh.

811
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:17,630
Stonks.

01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,150
Stonks, stonks, stonks!

813
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:21,730
And, uh, wait.

814
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:23,570
That's not who I wanted to click on.

815
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:23,850
You.

816
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:27,530
No, we're waiting for the balloon jutsu.

817
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:30,390

Um, we'll go.

We'll go with the Moab meme.

Nice gift.

829
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:00,420
Binary goals!

01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,360

833
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,280
Oh my god.

834
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:22,070
Oh my god.

835
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:24,230
Get him.

836
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:24,450
Oh.

837
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:25,250
So

838
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:32,820
fast.

839
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:33,540
So easily.

840
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:35,620
Oh.

841
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:38,760
Sniper monkey.

842
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:39,300
You know what?

843
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,980
I'm going to put another sniper monkey.

844
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,520
And I'm going to make him shoot faster.

845
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,220
Fast sniper monkey.

846
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:51,850
Yeah.

847
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:54,050
Oh.

848
01:02:58,090 --> 01:02:58,970
There we go.

849
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:00,090
Upgrade the bow.

850
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:01,630
I don't have any more.

851
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:02,310
I don't have any.

852
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:03,390
more that I can upgrade.

853
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:06,430
I'm gonna put another boat, though.

854
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:07,350
We'll put another boat.

855
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:12,520
Here.

856
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,580
Wait, can I put another boat right here?

857
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:18,680
No.

858
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:19,540
I think I might.

859
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:20,580
I can put one there.

860
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,220
Three boats!

861
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:27,820
Machine gun sniper monkey.

862
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,040
He's cracked.

863
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:31,000
That's why I like the sniper monkey so much.

864
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,080
What was I...

865
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:39,960
Oh, I realized I don't hear stream labs for some reason.

866
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,160
I'm so sorry, you guys.

867
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,280
I might have to turn them up.

868
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,700
I'm the lone wisp at the corner by of it.

869
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,780
Don't worry, ghost fire from ghost candles doesn't burn.

870
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:51,020
Just like how ghosts can't hurt you.

871
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,140
Bunny Garden got a weird update.

872
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:56,500
This is the update.

873
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:57,820
This is optimal bunnies.

874
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,440
See, you see Bubba so much, you return to monkey.

875
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,360
Yippee!

876
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,840
Knowledge point.

877
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:15,210
Return to monkey.

878
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:17,110
Monkey, monkey, monkey.

879
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:19,830
Monkey, monkey.

880
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:22,850
Monkey, monkey.

881
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:26,310
Monkey, monkey.

882
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:28,070
Monkey.

883
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:28,690
Nice.

884
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:34,050
Probably should do some more boomerang monkeys.

885
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:35,390
Oh wait!

886
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,480
Oh!

887
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,040
Um,

888
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:55,970
I've been, okay, what's the best monkey, what's the best
route for the, for the boats?

889
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:58,470
Because monkey is just a superior bunny.

890
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:00,410
Exactly, road, you get it.

891
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:01,590
You get it.

892
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:05,730
Top route.

893
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:07,970
Top path.

894
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:13,130
Oh no, wait, I wanted to get that one too.

895
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,090
It's okay.

896
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:17,090
We can at least start.

897
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:18,610
upgrading some of these guys.

898
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:23,290
I'm feeling insulted by that.

899
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:29,190
Actually, there's quite a few rabbits in there, I think.

900
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:30,910
Where's the monkey girl cafe?

901
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:32,250
Whoa, why was it stuck?

902
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:33,670
Ha, ha.

903
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,500
I'm waiting.

904
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:40,100
Ooh!

905
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,620
He's waiting.

906
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:49,550
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

907
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:49,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

908
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:54,430
Am I gonna be okay?

909
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:57,090
Get it!

910
01:05:57,210 --> 01:05:58,950
Oh, why was it taking you so long?

911
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:03,790
Buccaneer is one of the best towers I am on.

912
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:05,770
But each path has its uses.

913
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:07,850
This is the Buccaneer?

914
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:08,710
Oh, wait.

915
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:11,750
Oh.

916
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:16,170
Like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

917
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:17,870
Ah, I forgot.

918
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:19,130
I called just a boat.

919
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:19,710
Oh.

920
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:23,370
I think we might be okay.

921
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:38,750
That's the camel can only shoot sniper with goggles.

922
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:39,630
Yeah, yeah, I know.

923
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:42,110
But he had the goggles.

924
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:44,590
He just wasn't doing anything.

925
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:46,990
But it's okay.

926
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:49,770
We are good to go.

927
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:52,610
Ah, attacks super duper fast.

928
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:58,870
But I really want the extra money.

929
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:02,570
But it's only one guy.

930
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:05,030
Okay, I'll get the destroyer.

931
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:08,690
It's only one guy that will be generating the money for now.

932
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:20,270
I don't know what I have that is stopping the moabs.

933
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:21,270
That's kind of awesome.

934
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:22,810
Is it you?

935
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:26,550
Um, is anyone gonna attack it?

936
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:29,970
Oh, the sniper!

937
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:33,010
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

938
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:35,110
So funny.

939
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:37,730
Alright.

940
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,130
What do I do?

941
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:40,390
Um, long range.

942
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:42,330
Oh, camel bloons.

943
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:52,180
Mmm.

944
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:54,120
Middle path on the destroyer.

945
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,160
Well, I was going to do one middle and one bottom, so.

946
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:01,610
Whoa.

947
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:06,010
Nice.

948
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:07,090
Oh,

949
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:12,180
yeah.

950
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,740
I forgot that I need to do this one, too.

951
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,920
The frag bombs.

952
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:22,440
Should I do a frag or should I do bigger bombs?

953
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:33,420
two layers pop more blooms maybe the bottom that monkey
placement just works can't let any balloon go through if all

954
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:49,520
the monkeys at the front start them or stop though yeah frag
yeah that's yeah yeah nice there it is it's coming you guys

955
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:56,300
don't worry it's gonna get you Oh, it'll show up eventually,
maybe.

956
01:08:58,620 --> 01:08:59,100
Yippee!

957
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,740
All right, let's try and get to level 100.

958
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:11,880
I've seen somewhere, like, the whole thing is just DDTs.

959
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,700
And I'm like, how much crazier can they get?

960
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,400
I think we'll be okay on the next one, even.

961
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,640
But if not, well...

962
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:33,780
Look at that.

963
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,040
Oh my god.

964
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:36,940
Hi, sweetie!

965
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,360
Thank you for the rifting you did!

966
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:39,460
Thank you!

967
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,980
Thank you so much!

968
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,570
Thank you so much!

969
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:55,170
Thank you, thank you!

970
01:09:57,870 --> 01:09:59,150
Let's see.

971
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:05,050
I

972
01:10:09,490 --> 01:10:11,910
always feel bad when like people gifts.

973
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:19,330
Like, you know, I, um, I kind of mentioned it when I first
started memberships that like, you know, I kind of priced it

974
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:22,170
lower because my focus is on the podcast.

975
01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:24,790
And I know the podcast is not forever.

976
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:29,850
And once the podcast ends, I'll be able to do more
membership stuff.

977
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:34,550
But, and I won't change the price.

978
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:37,650
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

979
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:39,390
Oh, we're okay.

980
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:45,010
Oh, we're okay.

981
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:49,850
Oh, round 63.

982
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:50,870
is kind of crazy.

983
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:56,010
Spike turrets can be good on those curves.

984
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:57,470
I was just...

985
01:10:57,470 --> 01:10:58,630
But I have...

986
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:00,370
I was just thinking about putting this one.

987
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:03,050
I do not have...

988
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,470
Like, you're talking about this thing, right?

989
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:07,050
Melted ice cubes!

990
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:07,770
Welcome to my show!

991
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:11,970
Trees.

992
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:13,190
I know.

993
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:14,170
I do need to plant some.

994
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:16,110
But I'm, like, trying to find a good place to plant it.

995
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:17,230
Right there.

996
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:18,790
It's perfect, actually.

997
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:22,870
Um, that's two, let's just...

998
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:25,950
Nice, and, uh...

999
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:27,690
Alright, 21.

1000
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:31,670
Uh...

1001
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:33,250
Yeah.

1002
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:34,530
32.

1003
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:35,890
14.

1004
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:38,570
Okay, we can probably get the Elite Defender.

1005
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:41,030
Oh, my dart monkey's down here!

1006
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:42,230
It's completely...

1007
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:44,270
Completely nothing!

1008
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:49,500
We'll just get him too.

1009
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,900
Moa, I'm the leader.

1010
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:57,480
Nice.

1011
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:00,760
He's helping.

1012
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:01,500
He was.

1013
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,480
He was helping.

1014
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:03,200
He was.

1015
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,220
Stupid shark!

1016
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,220
Thank you for the 20!

1017
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,220
Yeah, at least there's the emote.

1018
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,960
If I'm working on anything, I'll try and post like little
preview stuff.

1019
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:19,260
But...

1020
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:21,220
Right now, I have...

1021
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:31,740
have like nothing that is that i can show bfb handle it

1022
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,060

1023
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:45,970

1024
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:52,170

1025
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:17,690

01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:28,630

Intelligence Bureau or do I want to Chat is always right.

1027
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:30,270
I don't know about that.

1028
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:32,870
But I already have these one.

1029
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:33,730
Nope, never mind.

1030
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:36,450
I have this one as the bottom.

1031
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:37,110
Oh, I should have.

1032
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:40,190
I forgot that I was going to put the thing here.

1033
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:41,790
I should have done this one as the middle also.

1034
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:42,770
Oh, well.

1035
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:43,550
It's okay.

1036
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,680
Chat is kind of mostly sort of right.

1037
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,580
Middle path for DDT.

1038
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:07,760
Oh.

1039
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:12,940
this one let's add another boat baby

1040
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:30,960
we'll put you right here we'll just stack them all up
actually can I even I can't but that's okay oh wait maybe

1041
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:40,000
the faster shooting up top you and your boats meant Getting
a little crowded in there.

1042
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:41,560
Not that.

1043
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:43,580
The monkey village.

1044
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:44,460
Oh my god, Samson!

1045
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:45,760
Stop yelling at me!

1046
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:46,820
Oh,

1047
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:51,860
this one for DD team.

1048
01:14:57,780 --> 01:14:58,880
Oops, no, you're okay.

1049
01:14:59,220 --> 01:14:59,620
I'm kidding.

1050
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:00,000
I'm kidding.

1051
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:00,520
Don't worry.

1052
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,400
Everyone yell at her.

1053
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:04,980
No, stop yelling at me!

1054
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,860
I'm sensitive today, you guys.

1055
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:07,540
I'm sensitive.

1056
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:19,050
This is like a classic example.

1057
01:15:19,070 --> 01:15:20,750
of miscommunication.

1058
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:24,250
Here I was like, okay, another boat.

1059
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:30,230
I was just like, okay.

1060
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:34,820
Oh, sorry.

1061
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,220
I clicked out of the video.

1062
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,940
Or the video, the game.

1063
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,080
DDT is 90 plus.

1064
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:42,660
Are you sure?

1065
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:45,900
I'm pretty sure there's at least one before, right?

1066
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:48,000
Did I miss Bunny Garden?

1067
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:48,660
I'm confused.

1068
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:49,560
I'm sorry, Blake.

1069
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:53,680
I switched Bunny Garden today to Bloons because I'm...

1070
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:58,100
I didn't, I wasn't, I didn't, I was only thinking of
balloons.

1071
01:15:58,960 --> 01:15:59,200
Oh.

1072
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:09,160
But this one allows a more range and pierce and projectile
speed.

1073
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:11,360
It just seems like the whammy, you know?

1074
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:15,660
But what I can do is I can put another one here.

1075
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:20,640
I can put another one here.

1076
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:29,500
one we'll go with the bureau big

1077
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:53,720
brain I know and then it can affect any monkeys down here
bigger radios okay oh my god handle it are blooms the weapon

1078
01:16:53,720 --> 01:17:03,260
to surpass metal gear nah I am afraid of no blooms I ain't
afraid of no balloons

1079
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,560
Oh wait I spent to do this one

1080
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:32,400
Bustin If you want a really good DDT defense Unlock
preemptive strike on the sub Have it see camo with a village

1081
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:41,960
And you're good to go Ah thanks Ben I'm gonna try I actually
I don't think I've unlocked anything on the sub So We should

1082
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:42,920
No, that's untrue.

1083
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,000
That's untrue.

1084
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,420
I've unlocked some stuff.

1085
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:46,940
Wait, so pre...

1086
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:47,540
What was it?

1087
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:49,700
Oh, preemptive strike.

1088
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:50,000
Oof.

1089
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:53,740
We're pretty far from that, but...

1090
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:55,540
Planted near the village.

1091
01:17:59,910 --> 01:18:00,350
Here.

1092
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,660
I'm going to do two of them.

1093
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:11,700
Okay.

1094
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:18,980
I can't upgrade it just yet, but...

1095
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,440
Middle path is crazy strong.

1096
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:20,860
Is it?

1097
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:21,380
Okay.

1098
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:24,240
This is why I have you guys here!

1099
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:26,180
Thanks guys!

1100
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:39,620
I don't really need that there, but whatever.

1101
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:43,420
Okay.

1102
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:45,460
600.

1103
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:46,500
Ooh.

1104
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:47,940
It might be tough.

1105
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:48,680
I'm not gonna lie.

1106
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,000
It might be tough to get this before.

1107
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:57,900
Is it loud?

1108
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,120
Let me be honest with you.

1109
01:18:59,260 --> 01:18:59,680
Is it loud?

1110
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,920
Top path for boat is really good.

1111
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,500
We're working on it.

1112
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:09,080
That's fine.

1113
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:16,340
Thank you guys.

1114
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,060
You guys are so cute.

1115
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:26,640
Sweet.

1116
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:30,420
Okay.

1117
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,060
Make it louder.

1118
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:35,040
Hopefully we get...

1119
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:41,760
let's see we're only at 3,000 but that's okay we're working
on it we're working on it even if we don't have it for this

1120
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:46,120
for this one we can have it for future stuff right

1121
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:55,100
louder nice

1122
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:08,340
i'm gonna try and get um this monkey to the crossbow master

1123
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:15,280
and get him to crossbow him oh wait i forgot him i added
this guy

1124
01:20:23,870 --> 01:20:32,450
wait where'd he go wait yeah yeah where's the monkey i just
oh

1125
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:46,460
my my bananas we're gonna go rotten

1126
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:57,180
or oh wait i think actually i should go for the elite
defender i think probably

1127
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,200
Eke!

1128
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:04,660
Eke!

1129
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:05,040
Eke!

1130
01:21:13,450 --> 01:21:15,190
Feel nature's wrath.

1131
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:18,690
Okay, 75.

1132
01:21:19,470 --> 01:21:20,590
Bananas have gone bad.

1133
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:21,390
No, they're still good.

1134
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:22,850
They're just a little brown.

1135
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:25,550
Nothing wrong with that.

1136
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:26,050
Whoa!

1137
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,720
That was so close, right?

1138
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:32,640
Woof!

1139
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:33,900
Easy peasy.

1140
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:37,900
She's gonna die.

1141
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,580
What'd you say, gamer random?

1142
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:41,140
What'd you say?

1143
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:44,440
Would you say I was going to die, huh?

1144
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,040
I think, uh...

1145
01:21:57,860 --> 01:22:01,520
No, I know that I always usually die at 93.

1146
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:06,580
No, unbeliever.

1147
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:11,200
I wish, though, I could upgrade these guys.

1148
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:13,240
Twin gun.

1149
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,200
Actually, because we...

1150
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,140
The long-range targeting...

1151
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:24,540
wait which one oh no yeah i'm going for the middle

1152
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:40,000
what's the bottom path oh double attack speed enhances
attack speed of other weapons

1153
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:51,810
advanced intel for subs is huge okay well i have that
unlocked so i figure it's probably better to do it oh wait i

1154
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:58,030
didn't get this one oh my gosh my bad Oops, too many boats
and stuff here.

1155
01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:00,890
I have too many boats.

1156
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:02,390
Can't see everything.

1157
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:04,170
Can't see anything.

1158
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:08,930
Well, guys, this might be it.

1159
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:11,330
This might be it.

1160
01:23:12,330 --> 01:23:13,130
If it is.

1161
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:15,950
I guess we'll see.

1162
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:23,140
Add another dart monkey.

1163
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:28,590
Dart monkey.

1164
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:29,690
Yeah!

1165
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:38,140
Maybe I can.

1166
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,900
I can spike-polt him.

1167
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:44,020
Spike-polt my monkey.

1168
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:50,060
We'll make him faster, because he's slow.

1169
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:51,820
Go monkey, go!

1170
01:24:06,930 --> 01:24:08,930
We'll just do a couple of those.

1171
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:11,970
We're still alive, baby!

1172
01:24:17,690 --> 01:24:18,750
Oh no!

1173
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:20,450
Oh, we're still alive, baby!

1174
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:43,340
It helps that we have a bunch of guys that are able to see
camo balloons.

1175
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:44,460
So, shoo!

1176
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:46,840
Giant foot.

1177
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:53,840
If you set the target of the spike path to the last, you
will throw all the way down the path.

1178
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:56,320
That is a great idea.

1179
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,020
That is actually a really good idea.

1180
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,440
Yes, yes, yes.

1181
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,880
But you're already dead.

1182
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:08,780
Oh, you're so right.

1183
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:15,000
I'm such a hypocrite saying that we're alive, aren't I?

1184
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,840
I mean, you guys are alive.

1185
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:17,980
I'm the dead one.

1186
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:23,910
You know, it just goes things.

1187
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:33,310
I think I can make the next one.

1188
01:25:34,410 --> 01:25:36,890
I might regret saying that, but...

1189
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:39,850
Holy cow!

1190
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:41,310
Holy moly!

1191
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:42,810
Rise!

1192
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:46,650
Oh my god!

1193
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:49,130
Yo, look at the memoship there!

1194
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:58,880
Rise!

1195
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:02,460
Wow.

1196
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,120
Couldn't even get to the trees!

1197
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:09,880
Oh!

1198
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:27,780
easy peasy just like that I am I am gonna add a helicopter
monkey in here though and I'm going to I want to buy a

1199
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:37,380
village whoops where'd he go but I don't think I can hmm
village

1200
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:48,210
for the snipers that is true too down here I'm

1201
01:26:56,580 --> 01:27:04,600
gonna put it here okay so here's the here's the plan put one
here so when i fill out this area it reaches with the range

1202
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:11,360
and then we can have one down here that will help any
monkeys over here so we'll just kind of put this one right

1203
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:19,360
on the edge right on the edge right there and um

1204
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:37,480
should we do it well we have this one oh wait oh oh my gosh
i have this one that's the oh this one yeah I was gonna do

1205
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:46,400
that earlier I completely forgot oh my gosh Keith thanks to
the five gifted money money middle path village for camo and

1206
01:27:46,400 --> 01:28:01,980
yeah you're right you're right and we could do the bigger
radius oops no jungle there we go oh the ZOMG ZOMG ZOMG

1207
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:03,240
sorry I'm American

1208
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:12,520
ZOMG Oh my gosh So easy

1209
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:30,540
The snipers already see camo I think This one does not This
one This guy doesn't Now he does because of here This guy

1210
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:40,140
did So it was kind of like whatever But This guy who's super
fast did not So it's okay Um I think this guy also already

1211
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:40,480
did.

1212
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:41,680
Oh yeah, yeah, he did.

1213
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:42,340
But that's okay.

1214
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:42,840
It's okay.

1215
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:47,580
We're gonna have monkeys down here that aren't able to see
camo, so it's okay.

1216
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,560
Do you think we'll ever do a few games with the Wisps?

1217
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:53,540
You can even make a team clan and have weekly challenges?

1218
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,080
Like, like this game?

1219
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:58,200
Like, bloons game?

1220
01:29:04,820 --> 01:29:07,060
Can you, can you make teams and bloons?

1221
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:08,080
Is there multi?

1222
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:09,700
This game has a clan system.

1223
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:10,380
Really?

1224
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:11,100
Really?

1225
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,100
Oh, then hell yeah!

1226
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:16,640
Let's do it!

1227
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:25,620
Co-op bloons!

1228
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:26,960
I'm gonna...

1229
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:32,460
Can you imagine if, like, two people are trying to play
bloons at the same time and I, like, put something down and,

1230
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:37,260
like, whoever I'm playing with immediately sells it and it's
just, like, stop it!

1231
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:44,880
Like, they sell it, like, put another thing in its place
trying to optimize the map and I'm just like, la, la, la...

1232
01:29:54,410 --> 01:29:56,290
Oh, I shouldn't have...

1233
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:58,110
I didn't realize it was still there.

1234
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:04,980
Go, monkeys!

1235
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:05,580
Go!

1236
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:09,480
Gosh.

1237
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:11,720
Crazy.

1238
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,220
Have you done a boss battle yet?

1239
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:15,700
In balloons, I have not.

1240
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:16,400
I am not.

1241
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:18,840
I am going to put this one here.

1242
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:25,860
I actually have not used the spike.

1243
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:38,120
factory at all and so i do want to trade it a little bit if
i can um magic monkey i also want to i've barely used him um

gonna put him like right here he's just kind of like a

1245
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:58,520

1250
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:34,640

idea back end defense yeah that's what i was thinking and we

1254
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:04,360
It's okay.

1255
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:05,800
It's okay.

1256
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:07,640
Nature prevails.

1257
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:10,480
Nature prevails.

1258
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:11,280
Nature prevails.

1259
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:14,640
I'm wondering if I should have a glue monkey.

1260
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,140
Sticky monkey.

1261
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:19,840
Hmm.

1262
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:23,960
Just slow down anybody.

1263
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,520
Bottom path for sticky monkey.

1264
01:32:36,330 --> 01:32:37,890
Bloon Solver is crazy.

1265
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:39,150
Bloon's a problem.

1266
01:32:39,330 --> 01:32:40,230
Here's the solution.

1267
01:32:40,650 --> 01:32:42,270
I can't unlock it yet, though.

1268
01:32:44,190 --> 01:32:45,710
I'm close to the super glue.

1269
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:53,360
Bottom path is good late game.

1270
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:56,160
Let's get a glue monkey.

1271
01:32:56,460 --> 01:33:00,440
We'll put him kind of close to the front so we can start
slowing people down.

1272
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:04,380
I'm just going to put him right on top of there.

1273
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,400
And we're going to give him...

1274
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:12,820
We're gonna do the bottom path for you.

1275
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:15,600
I usually do bottom path and then two up top.

1276
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:20,420
Zero two five glue is good, especially since you have camo.

1277
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:22,720
Oh, like this one.

1278
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:25,180
Okay.

1279
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:27,480
Zero two five.

1280
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:27,780
Okay.

1281
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:36,600
Start slowing those glues down.

1282
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:37,700
I mean, those bloons down.

1283
01:33:48,770 --> 01:33:49,410
Yeah!

1284
01:33:52,990 --> 01:33:55,490
I feel like that already made a ton of difference.

1285
01:33:56,090 --> 01:33:56,770
Holy cow.

1286
01:33:59,010 --> 01:34:01,430
I feel like that already made a ton of difference.

1287
01:34:02,530 --> 01:34:02,790
Oh, wait.

1288
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:04,410
Maybe I should have.

1289
01:34:04,730 --> 01:34:05,070
You know what?

1290
01:34:05,070 --> 01:34:05,250
Whatever.

1291
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:13,530
Are you doing anything?

1292
01:34:14,330 --> 01:34:14,910
Are you working?

1293
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:16,010
It's 22.

1294
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:20,130
Yeah!

1295
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:23,480
Rise!

1296
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,360
Can you, like, do something, though?

1297
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:25,900
Can you hear that?

1298
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:30,040
Upgrade some towers.

1299
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:35,060
I think for the most part, I've upgraded anything that I can
unless I'm...

1300
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:38,220
No, we're doing middle path here.

1301
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:42,620
Why is the sub taking so long to unlock anything?

1302
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:49,720
Like, the sub is taking so long to get any experience, but
they're killing a...

1303
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,240
Look at... Oh, wait, that's the boat.

1304
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:54,380
What's the name of the monkey on the bottom right?

1305
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:55,340
Is that a new monkey?

1306
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,120
I've been playing balloons in a while.

1307
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:58,660
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

1308
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:03,260
Less XP past post stage 60.

1309
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:05,740
Oh, I didn't realize.

1310
01:35:05,860 --> 01:35:08,240
Oh, I think actually I was told that before.

1311
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:09,520
And I just completely forgot.

1312
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:12,400
I'm going to place a helicopter down here.

1313
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:19,400
This might be not the best placement right here.

1314
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:21,660
But it's also kind of hard to place on this map.

1315
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:22,420
And I want him.

1316
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:24,540
Because, oh wait.

1317
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:27,640
But he'll also get to attack any type of bloom.

1318
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:29,300
Okay.

1319
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:34,420
So, can you destroy the house?

1320
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:35,380
You can't.

1321
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:36,240
Oh!

1322
01:35:41,590 --> 01:35:42,550
Tickle, tickle.

1323
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:44,650
Tickle, tickle.

1324
01:35:48,990 --> 01:35:50,370
Kelly's good can move it wherever.

1325
01:35:50,730 --> 01:35:56,550
Yeah, so usually what I do with the helicopter is I do, um,
I do two, five.

1326
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:07,470
But, no, I'm sorry.

1327
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:09,590
The two up here.

1328
01:36:12,790 --> 01:36:28,750
I do two zero five well four in my case but two zero five is
fine even if I so but if I put it here I'll be able to to um

1329
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:41,030
actually I might be able to put it right here oh come on
there is space there maybe down here then over here on the

1330
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:44,310
rock Maybe right here then.

1331
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:49,370
Put it next to the snipers.

1332
01:36:49,710 --> 01:36:50,450
Okay, yeah.

1333
01:36:51,210 --> 01:36:55,030
I think it'd be best to have the power up from the...

1334
01:36:58,050 --> 01:36:58,730
Two...

1335
01:36:58,730 --> 01:36:59,510
Five, okay.

1336
01:37:02,370 --> 01:37:02,650
Yeah!

1337
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:05,970
Set OMG!

1338
01:37:06,650 --> 01:37:07,290
Handle it!

1339
01:37:12,790 --> 01:37:13,890
But it's Haram!

1340
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:18,310
Handle it.

1341
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:23,240
What the heck?

1342
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:24,660
So easy.

1343
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:31,560
Handle it.

1344
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:33,820
Go, monkeys!

1345
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:34,360
Go!

1346
01:37:38,530 --> 01:37:41,170
We don't have the DDTs yet, so...

1347
01:37:49,650 --> 01:37:51,770
Oh my gosh!

1348
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:54,370
I'm watching from bed.

1349
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:58,290
You better be doing the stuff that you were supposed to be
doing, Missy.

1350
01:37:59,030 --> 01:38:00,750
You better be doing that stuff.

1351
01:38:04,710 --> 01:38:06,550
She's developing a new meta.

1352
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:10,830
You'd be homeless if you had...

1353
01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:14,130
Wait, if this had an MGS collab, jet section.

1354
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:22,470
Why are you gonna say it like that?

1355
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:25,010
I wouldn't...

1356
01:38:25,010 --> 01:38:26,150
I didn't...

1357
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:29,750
I didn't become homeless when Fortnite had Metal Gear, huh?

1358
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:31,630
So...

1359
01:38:32,430 --> 01:38:34,110
I think I'm pretty good.

1360
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:35,990
I think I'm okay.

1361
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:41,070
I think I can handle myself.

1362
01:38:44,150 --> 01:38:45,750
As OBGYN would say.

1363
01:38:46,270 --> 01:38:46,950
Handle it.

1364
01:38:58,450 --> 01:38:59,370
Holy cow!

1365
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:04,540
Oh my god.

1366
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:05,960
Our monkeys.

1367
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:11,000
Oh no, I was like, oh good, we have enough.

1368
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:12,220
No, I need the top.

1369
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:15,520
Oh my gosh, I need so much more for the top.

1370
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:25,240
It's, like, really tempting to, like, purchase the other
upgrades when you see that they're green in a lot of me.

1371
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:27,560
Like, this one.

1372
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:27,940
Ah!

1373
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:28,780
Oh!

1374
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:30,040
Oh!

1375
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:32,900
Heat tips.

1376
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:37,220
Heat tips.

1377
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:40,120
Okay, we're gonna upload.

1378
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:40,520
Upload.

1379
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:43,240
We're gonna upgrade the Moab Eliminator next.

1380
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,400
What with the adjective?

1381
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:49,620
for a monkey be like Psycho Mantis or Sniper Wolf?

1382
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:53,720
Monkey, monkey.

1383
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:57,400
Wizard?

1384
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:58,540
Where's my wizard?

1385
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,620
It's so hard to see where anybody is.

1386
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:03,780
Uh, he's also pretty...

1387
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:06,180
Oh wait, no, wizard.

1388
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:06,940
Oh, him!

1389
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:08,860
No, he's like got nothing.

1390
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:12,440
My wizard's at nothing.

1391
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:14,740
He's so small.

1392
01:40:20,570 --> 01:40:32,170
Manic monkey actually that sounds That actually sounds like
it could be real Manic monkey Who's that monkey?

1393
01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:36,110
Monkey monkey Who's that monkey?

1394
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:49,950
Monkey monkey Oh wait Or maybe Maybe I should do the sniper
monkey Hmm Maybe I should make my sniper monkey instead of

1395
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:50,350
you.

1396
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:54,830
This is the...

1397
01:40:54,830 --> 01:40:58,250
Moabs are immobilized for longer and take extra damage from
all the other attacks.

1398
01:40:59,790 --> 01:41:01,330
You can name your monkeys with them.

1399
01:41:01,590 --> 01:41:02,070
A.K.A.

1400
01:41:02,190 --> 01:41:02,770
sniper wolf.

1401
01:41:03,070 --> 01:41:03,230
I can?

1402
01:41:04,710 --> 01:41:05,770
No, I can't.

1403
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:18,380
Change sniper to strong.

1404
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:18,660
Which?

1405
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:18,940
Oh.

1406
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:20,520
I usually do.

1407
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:21,160
Thank you.

1408
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:23,000
I usually do.

1409
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:23,720
Thank you.

1410
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:25,160
Handle it.

1411
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:26,780
Handle it!

1412
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:28,260
Oh, they're fast.

1413
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:30,100
Oh, they're fast and they're furious.

1414
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:34,660
Oh, they're fast and they're furious.

1415
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:44,620
Nature prevails, everybody.

1416
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:48,420
Need to buy the ability to name them from the shop.

1417
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:48,920
Really?

1418
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:49,720
That's crazy.

1419
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:54,420
Coming up on the faded round soon.

1420
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:57,020
We're getting close to DDTs.

1421
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,660
I know, I know, I'm scared.

1422
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:01,020
First DDT check.

1423
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:01,920
Oh gosh.

1424
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:04,140
That's why I'm thinking I should...

1425
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:14,220
Massive damage to Moab's and assassinate ability deals six
time damage with a short cooldown.

1426
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,320
Take extra damage from all the other attacks.

1427
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:31,660
I think I'm gonna save up for the sniper monkey.

1428
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:41,040
No way!

1429
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:43,540
Oh,

1430
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:50,020
thank you.

1431
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:51,620
I always forget.

1432
01:42:51,740 --> 01:42:56,260
I do usually change these, but I think I'm just, like, silly
because I...

1433
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,560
Because, you know.

1434
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,220
Just silly things.

1435
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:07,220
I must resist.

1436
01:43:33,090 --> 01:43:35,190
Oh, oh, oh!

1437
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:36,690
Oh!

1438
01:43:37,730 --> 01:43:41,990
Ooh, that was not so great.

1439
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:45,070
That was not so great.

1440
01:43:45,710 --> 01:43:47,470
That was a little rough, I think.

1441
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:49,810
That was a little rough.

1442
01:43:49,950 --> 01:43:51,290
No, don't leave!

1443
01:43:54,290 --> 01:43:58,090
No, but...

1444
01:43:58,090 --> 01:44:00,330
Big sniper monkey.

1445
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:04,270
Big sniper monkey.

1446
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,020
He's slow, though.

1447
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:14,120
I wonder if it's okay.

1448
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:16,540
that he's so slow

1449
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:25,980
ZOMD RISE

1450
01:44:29,090 --> 01:44:38,090
it's the next round that I'm really worried about you guys
uh oh wait oh no oh no we're about to lose okay it's the

1451
01:44:38,090 --> 01:44:47,870
next round that I'm worried about hmm I don't think I have
so much money that I can like also I should just start

1452
01:44:47,870 --> 01:44:55,950
unlocking these because i have nothing else to unlock here
the dreaded 93

1453
01:44:59,270 --> 01:45:13,830
both both snipers target strong so we're okay pursuit spike
factory is just down here doing his thing oh gosh you got

1454
01:45:13,830 --> 01:45:27,690
this unironically you think so okay i just always die at 93
so we'll see oh okay good

1455
01:45:37,410 --> 01:45:40,850
let's go

1456
01:45:47,490 --> 01:45:58,790
let's go easy easy peasy i love balloons Oh my gosh.

1457
01:45:58,970 --> 01:46:00,950
Is there anything else we should add in?

1458
01:46:01,090 --> 01:46:01,590
I was thinking...

1459
01:46:04,030 --> 01:46:04,710
No!

1460
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:09,000
We're close.

1461
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:09,580
We're close.

1462
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:14,340
No.

1463
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:16,520
We'll save up.

1464
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:17,160
We'll save up.

1465
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:21,000
Um.

1466
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:22,560
I'm trying to...

1467
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:22,760
Um.

1468
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:25,160
I thought it was a good place for Gatlin Monkey.

1469
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:26,880
Hmm.

1470
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:28,620
Add a glue monkey?

1471
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:29,580
Oh.

1472
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,640
Okay, if you guys think I need another one.

1473
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:33,520
Where is he?

1474
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:34,260
Oh, glue monkey.

1475
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:36,240
Like right here.

1476
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:37,740
Right next to other glue monkey.

1477
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:42,040
Um, should I just do the same?

1478
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:46,440
Well, this one, maybe I do the corrosive on this one, right?

1479
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:48,180
Or should I just do the same route?

1480
01:46:53,860 --> 01:46:56,840
You can make that one aggressive with a balloon liquefier.

1481
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:02,800
Alchemist busts, butt, butt, butt, butt.

1482
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:05,760
Alchemists buff snipers?

1483
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:11,060
Glue does not stack with other glues.

1484
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:12,280
It doesn't.

1485
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:13,200
Uh-oh.

1486
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:15,040
But maybe then we do the corrosive.

1487
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:21,380
So if he gets, if he slows them down, he starts, he starts,
uh, so we'll do, we'll do the corrosive.

1488
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:25,540
Um, then we'll do, we'll do more.

1489
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:27,000
He gets, he gets more of them.

1490
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:27,980
He gets anything that...

1491
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:29,040
Alchemists are really good.

1492
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:29,680
Oh, shoot.

1493
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:30,080
Okay.

1494
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:31,180
I'm gonna...

1495
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:33,160
Alchemist Monkey D.

1496
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:47,780
down here this is the alchemist right my own oh yeah yeah
okay right there baby how does he buff them powerful

1497
01:47:51,830 --> 01:48:00,730
monster top path louse oh there's a helpful potion that
nearby monkeys pop lead balloons and do extra damage to

1498
01:48:00,730 --> 01:48:08,230
ceramic oh there was a special brew the nearby monkeys
giving them extra damage range Well, range, whatever,

1499
01:48:08,450 --> 01:48:11,930
because it's, you know, snipers, but...

1500
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:17,020
Hmm.

1501
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:17,940
Okay.

1502
01:48:18,580 --> 01:48:19,680
Let's try it.

1503
01:48:30,450 --> 01:48:34,150
And then maybe the pool for, like, extra damage down here.

1504
01:48:35,350 --> 01:48:36,730
Top Alk is mega OP.

1505
01:48:37,530 --> 01:48:37,950
Really?

1506
01:48:38,990 --> 01:48:39,590
Oh.

1507
01:48:40,130 --> 01:48:41,490
You can try another round.

1508
01:48:41,710 --> 01:48:42,010
Yeah!

1509
01:48:43,390 --> 01:48:44,770
Pool is useless, really?

1510
01:48:45,090 --> 01:48:45,430
Okay.

1511
01:48:45,890 --> 01:48:47,030
I'm trusting you guys.

1512
01:48:49,810 --> 01:48:50,690
I'm, like, trying to...

1513
01:48:50,710 --> 01:48:53,810
I'm trying not to rely on you guys too much, but also take
your advice.

1514
01:48:58,550 --> 01:49:00,930
I don't want to seem like I'm just...

1515
01:49:00,930 --> 01:49:01,230
Ah!

1516
01:49:04,130 --> 01:49:04,890
Oh my god.

1517
01:49:06,570 --> 01:49:07,370
Holy cow.

1518
01:49:09,130 --> 01:49:09,790
It's okay.

1519
01:49:10,370 --> 01:49:10,670
Maybe.

1520
01:49:11,290 --> 01:49:12,450
Oh, maybe it's not okay.

1521
01:49:12,810 --> 01:49:13,090
Oh, no!

1522
01:49:13,270 --> 01:49:13,670
No, it's okay!

1523
01:49:17,170 --> 01:49:19,850
Oh, yeah, I don't think the Moab glue is working!

1524
01:49:20,470 --> 01:49:20,910
Uh-oh.

1525
01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:24,690
I think

1526
01:49:27,950 --> 01:49:42,250
That was close That was close The glue liquefied is
overriding the Moab glue Yeah, uh-oh Uh-oh I think I just

1527
01:49:42,250 --> 01:49:46,910
wasted a bunch of money Wait, what's going on here?

1528
01:49:47,910 --> 01:49:48,670
Why is it bubbly?

1529
01:49:51,170 --> 01:49:56,110
Why is it bubbling like that Oh, because he gave me a
potion!

1530
01:49:56,450 --> 01:49:57,030
That's so cute.

1531
01:50:00,570 --> 01:50:02,490
Sell useless stuff.

1532
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:04,610
No one's useless to me.

1533
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:08,210
I wish I could move them instead of just selling them, you
know.

1534
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:16,180
Okay.

1535
01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:16,920
Goodbye.

1536
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:19,560
Goodbye, balloon liquefier.

1537
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,100
Goodbye.

1538
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:25,980
Sorry, I shouldn't have put you there.

1539
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,500
I shouldn't have put you there.

1540
01:50:36,770 --> 01:50:39,330
Ooh, that scratch is a good itch.

1541
01:50:40,490 --> 01:50:43,110
Oh, this one I can unlock!

1542
01:50:45,530 --> 01:50:46,210
Should I unlock?

1543
01:50:46,390 --> 01:50:49,110
Wait, I might just be able to put that on him.

1544
01:50:49,210 --> 01:50:50,130
Wait, what does this do actually?

1545
01:50:50,570 --> 01:50:53,150
Glue so strong and temporarily immobilizes all affected
blooms.

1546
01:50:53,350 --> 01:50:54,210
Oh, let's go!

1547
01:50:54,650 --> 01:50:55,070
You know what?

1548
01:50:55,390 --> 01:50:56,110
Let's just get it.

1549
01:50:58,210 --> 01:50:59,150
How much is it?

1550
01:51:00,190 --> 01:51:12,270
we can do it live live live live oh

1551
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:23,680
my god oh

1552
01:51:29,370 --> 01:51:36,770
my god oh my god oh my

1553
01:51:43,710 --> 01:51:48,170
god you said not even close but to me that was pretty close

1554
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:55,300
that felt pretty close to me.

1555
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:06,450
I love I love Heli.

1556
01:52:06,590 --> 01:52:08,350
Heli monkey is so good.

1557
01:52:08,570 --> 01:52:09,450
Heli monkey is awesome.

1558
01:52:10,810 --> 01:52:11,510
What is this one?

1559
01:52:11,710 --> 01:52:14,970
Upgraded weapons also automatically causing three more
monkeys.

1560
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:16,010
Permanently.

1561
01:52:17,070 --> 01:52:18,050
98 is scary.

1562
01:52:18,830 --> 01:52:18,830
Okay.

1563
01:52:21,150 --> 01:52:21,630
97.

1564
01:52:21,930 --> 01:52:24,770
Everything above 90 is a pain apparently.

1565
01:52:27,870 --> 01:52:36,410
Here's the second VTuber I've seen excitedly shout I love
bloons Thanks Rico Don't know to test Don't know test to say

1566
01:52:36,410 --> 01:52:44,010

not hearing the stream labs But I am reading them so Lampi

1568
01:52:51,150 --> 01:52:55,250
Welcome to Mambusha Thank you Thank you so much

1569
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:01,440
One tier 5 to survive round 100.

1570
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:02,140
I have two!

1571
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:03,640
Well, tier 5 what?

1572
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:05,960
There's no notice.

1573
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:07,120
At all?

1574
01:53:14,950 --> 01:53:15,750
None at all.

1575
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:20,180
That's weird.

1576
01:53:24,820 --> 01:53:25,680
That's very strange.

1577
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:31,300
How long is the wait for a party at one of your cafes?

1578
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:33,540
Um, don't worry about it.

1579
01:53:39,210 --> 01:53:40,070
Orange sniper.

1580
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:41,930
This guy on fur?

1581
01:53:41,950 --> 01:53:49,310
I think he might actually need to be first because he's so
fast and if people are down here you need to like go for him

1582
01:53:49,310 --> 01:54:02,740
you know oh uh this one we can now pay for right we went for
the we're going for the this one right yeah this is a test

1583
01:54:02,740 --> 01:54:09,660
of the emergency super chat system it's not super chats with
the issue what kind of a game is this is a tower defense

1584
01:54:09,660 --> 01:54:19,050
game Oh my gosh, thank you.

1585
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:20,410
Holy cow.

1586
01:54:21,670 --> 01:54:24,670
I think this one is all, yeah, it's good for now.

1587
01:54:24,930 --> 01:54:26,710
Oh my gosh, thank you.

1588
01:54:27,430 --> 01:54:29,750
Can't believe I forgot to do that.

1589
01:54:41,330 --> 01:54:42,350
Super glue.

1590
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:51,500
Trying to think of I should add something else.

1591
01:54:51,660 --> 01:54:52,680
Maybe another ship.

1592
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:57,460
Maybe another boat because they have so much range.

1593
01:54:57,940 --> 01:55:00,000
Or a sub down here.

1594
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:01,660
Like right here.

1595
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:05,780
More helicopters?

1596
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:07,760
Nah.

1597
01:55:13,050 --> 01:55:13,510
Okay.

1598
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:18,100
Boat on lower.

Okay, so we'll do the boat instead.

01:55:28,090 --> 01:55:28,770
Down here.

1601
01:55:29,190 --> 01:55:30,590
If I can place them, hello?

There we go.

1603
01:55:31,970 --> 01:55:32,690
Nice and cozy.

1604
01:55:35,010 --> 01:55:36,270
Nice and cozy.

1605
01:55:38,590 --> 01:55:40,130

Why does Midday Balloon so much?

1616
01:57:55,140 --> 01:57:57,100
It's not balloons, it's balloons.

1617
01:57:58,780 --> 01:57:59,280
Not bad.

1618
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:00,280
It could be worse.

1619
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:03,300
They still got what down here about.

1620
01:58:05,740 --> 01:58:06,040
So.

1621
01:58:07,620 --> 01:58:08,380
What's in?

1622
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:09,180
Welcome to membership.

1623
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:09,880
Thank you.

1624
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:12,400
And GK Cyrene.

1625
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:13,400
Welcome to membership.

1626
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:14,960
Monkey.

1627
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:17,600
Duck your smoke on the membership.

1628
01:58:17,780 --> 01:58:18,480
Thank you guys.

1629
01:58:18,740 --> 01:58:19,300
Thank you so much.

1630
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:24,380
Slow them down more for what?

1631
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:25,760
Oh, the ice.

1632
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:26,220
Oh my gosh.

1633
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:26,700
Please.

1634
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:27,380
Pack cake.

1635
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:28,160
Please.

1636
01:58:33,350 --> 01:58:36,670
I don't even have my guys upgraded.

1637
01:58:37,590 --> 01:58:38,790
I don't think they'll do much.

1638
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:53,260
Okay.

1639
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:56,720
I think before I mentioned adding another helicopter.

1640
01:58:56,940 --> 01:58:58,320
I wish I could put them right in there.

1641
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:02,160
But, um...

1642
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:04,800
Unfortunately, he might have to be...

1643
01:59:07,420 --> 01:59:08,820
He may have to be...

1644
01:59:10,180 --> 01:59:10,700
Villageless.

1645
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:25,520
You can sell the Spike Factory.

1646
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:26,140
You know what?

1647
01:59:26,140 --> 01:59:27,740
I think you're right, actually, because...

1648
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:30,360
We're not getting anything from him.

1649
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:32,140
So yeah, we'll sell him.

1650
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:33,940
What?

1651
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:36,440
Fireball!

1652
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:39,580
Oh, I really want the Necromancer.

1653
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:40,440
answer.

1654
01:59:51,590 --> 01:59:52,950
07 Spike Factory.

1655
01:59:56,450 --> 01:59:58,410
Oh, I was gonna say, can I even fit?

1656
01:59:59,810 --> 02:00:03,770
I think I can make him fit to where I can add some other
monkeys into.

1657
02:00:04,210 --> 02:00:05,410
Like, let me see.

1658
02:00:05,650 --> 02:00:06,750
Can I put like...

1659
02:00:06,750 --> 02:00:06,830
Oh.

1660
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:09,390
No.

1661
02:00:09,750 --> 02:00:10,850
Oh, a little bit.

1662
02:00:10,910 --> 02:00:11,790
A little bit.

1663
02:00:12,030 --> 02:00:12,710
A little bit.

1664
02:00:13,210 --> 02:00:14,430
A little bit.

1665
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:19,080
Um...

1666
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:20,000
Okay.

1667
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:23,220
Hmm.

1668
02:00:25,420 --> 02:00:27,700
Spike Factory has served its purpose.

1669
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:35,780
A 000 ice monkey is insecure.

1670
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:39,860
Let's see.

1671
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:40,820
Okay, we're gonna do...

1672
02:00:40,820 --> 02:00:42,600
I like to do the pursuit.

1673
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:44,660
We have Moab shove.

1674
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:46,880
Do I want another one, though?

1675
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:51,460
Shove is Emblem.

1676
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:59,460
buy and buy it bigger jets um and our little guys when
they're needed i'm wondering if i should just do four two on

1677
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:13,700
this one i can only go up to three though i don't have the
apache dart ship i don't have apache monkey how do you say

1678
02:01:13,700 --> 02:01:19,400
this com com com com chomach Comanche?

1679
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:22,680
204 spam!

1680
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:27,540
You'll get to 4 soon enough?

1681
02:01:27,700 --> 02:01:33,060
I don't think in this though because I'm higher so the XP is
way lower.

1682
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:35,880
If you like tower defense, check out Domekeeper.

1683
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:36,620
Oh I do.

1684
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:38,100
Trip trap!

1685
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:39,500
Welcome to membership.

1686
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:41,180
Comanche.

1687
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:42,940
Oh my god.

1688
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:43,800
Comanche.

1689
02:01:49,780 --> 02:01:50,320
204.

1690
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:52,400
I think I feel safer like that.

1691
02:01:54,860 --> 02:01:57,580
Because then I can do the high level one, you know?

1692
02:01:57,900 --> 02:01:58,160
Okay.

1693
02:01:58,960 --> 02:01:59,560
Here we go.

1694
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:03,140
Handle it.

1695
02:02:03,940 --> 02:02:05,040
C-O-M-G.

1696
02:02:06,940 --> 02:02:08,220
Handle it.

1697
02:02:14,820 --> 02:02:16,100
Handle it.

1698
02:02:16,420 --> 02:02:17,660
Handle it.

1699
02:02:18,700 --> 02:02:19,620
Handle it.

1700
02:02:22,780 --> 02:02:24,680
really moving because both of them are shoving.

1701
02:02:26,660 --> 02:02:27,200
Yo!

1702
02:02:31,700 --> 02:02:32,720
Let's go!

1703
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:40,700
Yeah, the sniper and the two planes are just making him
like, stuck there.

1704
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:41,540
Nice.

1705
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:42,100
You know what?

1706
02:02:42,380 --> 02:02:44,320
I'm even gonna go for round the next round.

1707
02:02:44,740 --> 02:02:47,400
This might be a mistake, but...

1708
02:02:49,700 --> 02:02:51,650
This might be a mistake, but...

1709
02:02:58,380 --> 02:02:59,680
Nature prevails, baby.

1710
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:01,140
Nature prevails!

1711
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:07,780
Don't bust it, no!

1712
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:12,060
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh!

1713
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:15,940
Oh my god, no!

1714
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:16,980
I'm gonna die!

1715
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:26,800
I'm gonna die!

1716
02:03:31,660 --> 02:03:35,060
I just wanted to get to level one, had...

1717
02:03:40,140 --> 02:03:42,700
The last round was such a tease.

1718
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:45,620
It made me feel so confident.

1719
02:03:46,540 --> 02:03:49,040
Oh, we were two levels away.

1720
02:03:53,550 --> 02:03:53,650
No.

1721
02:03:55,250 --> 02:03:56,790
98 is one of the hardest rounds.

1722
02:03:57,930 --> 02:03:58,430
Yeah, wrong.

1723
02:04:01,990 --> 02:04:02,950
Okay, Icarus.

1724
02:04:03,130 --> 02:04:07,130
Hey, what would have happened if you had the zero, zero,
zero ice monkey?

1725
02:04:09,570 --> 02:04:16,650
Not sure how monkeys got their hands on Comanche's when the
Comanche program was canceled 20 years ago before it even

1726
02:04:16,650 --> 02:04:17,790
entered production.

1727
02:04:19,070 --> 02:04:23,790
Look, monkey technology is not for you to judge, okay?

1728
02:04:26,990 --> 02:04:29,230
You vegetated it.

1729
02:04:31,030 --> 02:04:32,470
Only you listen to Ice Monkey.

1730
02:04:38,050 --> 02:04:39,930
It's mint over.

1731
02:04:47,030 --> 02:04:48,870
Dang you.

1732
02:04:49,850 --> 02:04:51,130
Dang you!

1733
02:04:51,410 --> 02:04:51,590
Wait!

1734
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:54,510
It's free.

1735
02:04:55,670 --> 02:04:57,030
If I want to continue.

1736
02:04:58,650 --> 02:05:00,210
Need more Hinde.

1737
02:05:00,990 --> 02:05:01,950
Free continue!

1738
02:05:04,390 --> 02:05:05,870
For free?

1739
02:05:06,070 --> 02:05:06,630
Do not.

1740
02:05:07,490 --> 02:05:08,170
Why not?

1741
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:09,490
We could get to level 100!

1742
02:05:10,810 --> 02:05:11,310
Right?

1743
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,020
Only the first continues free.

1744
02:05:22,220 --> 02:05:23,580
Just level the monkeys.

1745
02:05:24,380 --> 02:05:25,240
You're probably right.

1746
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:29,960
It would be better to get more experience.

1747
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:32,780
Look, that monkey is just like me.

1748
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:38,320
Monkey is just like me.

1749
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:53,160
Game over.

1750
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:01,220
No,

1751
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,840
stop here taking my spotlight, monkey.

1752
02:06:11,860 --> 02:06:14,300
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1753
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:15,860
My bad.

1754
02:06:23,350 --> 02:06:24,430
Game over!

1755
02:06:27,550 --> 02:06:28,510
Oh god.

1756
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:34,600
Whoa.

1757
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:35,800
Yeah.

1758
02:06:37,160 --> 02:06:37,480
Yeah.

1759
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:42,980
Why are you like this?

1760
02:06:43,160 --> 02:06:44,340
What are you talking about?

1761
02:06:49,940 --> 02:06:51,000
Collection event.

1762
02:06:51,900 --> 02:06:52,920
I'm collecting a monkey!

1763
02:06:56,860 --> 02:06:57,580
Insta!

1764
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:58,520
Insta monkey!

1765
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:02,460
Insta monkey!

1766
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:09,320
Wait, what are these?

1767
02:07:11,720 --> 02:07:13,200
Featured Insta monkeys.

1768
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:15,840
Wait, someone said by the fountain, right?

1769
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:17,940
This guy...

1770
02:07:17,940 --> 02:07:20,860
There's a... Is it a challenge to get the monkey?

1771
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:22,460
No.

1772
02:07:22,720 --> 02:07:24,160
Tutorial to get the monkey?

1773
02:07:25,460 --> 02:07:26,960
You can get whatever the hell these are.

1774
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:28,440
Experiments on the monkey?

1775
02:07:30,420 --> 02:07:33,600
50 Moab class balloons on each round!

1776
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:37,580
How much money did they give you up first?

1777
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:40,460
The raids.

1778
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:41,360
Oh, is that what it is?

1779
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:42,900
Wait, how do you see the raids?

1780
02:07:43,540 --> 02:07:44,960
Hold on.

1781
02:07:45,940 --> 02:07:46,900
Monkey boost.

1782
02:07:57,660 --> 02:07:58,140
Events.

1783
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:03,180
Ah!

1784
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:06,080
You need to be level 40.

1785
02:08:06,580 --> 02:08:08,140
Well, shucks.

1786
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:24,140
social I want to change my oh good good good let's change to
general monk oh no sniper monkey my favorite my favorite

1787
02:08:24,140 --> 02:08:35,160
sniper monkey any new heroes I think I have to pay for all
of them there he is the the Pat Fusty by Benjamin.

1788
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:38,440
Um, Eliza.

1789
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:39,860
Adora.

1790
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:42,760
I don't have so much money, though.

1791
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:44,600
I can't even afford a single monkey.

1792
02:08:59,570 --> 02:09:00,090
Geraldo.

1793
02:09:00,910 --> 02:09:01,310
The goat.

1794
02:09:02,430 --> 02:09:02,770
Geraldo.

1795
02:09:04,110 --> 02:09:05,390
I like Corvus.

1796
02:09:05,530 --> 02:09:06,230
Is this guy new?

1797
02:09:09,050 --> 02:09:10,910
A guide to the book of spirits.

1798
02:09:11,330 --> 02:09:14,510
Help Corvus harvest the bloons on dark paths.

1799
02:09:14,530 --> 02:09:16,390
What does he do though?

1800
02:09:16,650 --> 02:09:16,950
Oh here.

1801
02:09:17,670 --> 02:09:18,690
Haunted balloons!

1802
02:09:19,810 --> 02:09:23,490
Are weakened and explode when popped, adding mana to the
mana pool.

1803
02:09:25,810 --> 02:09:29,370
The spirit attacks balloons wherever on the map of Corvus'
command.

1804
02:09:31,150 --> 02:09:31,510
Interesting.

1805
02:09:32,590 --> 02:09:34,770
It's amazing but hard to use optimally.

1806
02:09:35,550 --> 02:09:37,150
The Corvus is too complicated.

1807
02:09:39,630 --> 02:09:40,830
Whoa, my...

1808
02:09:40,830 --> 02:09:41,250
Whoa!

1809
02:09:44,530 --> 02:09:45,010
Awesome!

1810
02:09:46,630 --> 02:09:48,610
I like how... I like... I like this guy.

1811
02:09:48,710 --> 02:09:49,150
That's me.

1812
02:09:51,630 --> 02:09:52,330
Oh, yes.

1813
02:09:52,410 --> 02:09:53,850
I like when they have different outfits.

1814
02:09:54,290 --> 02:09:56,550
I know they're just cosmetic, but they look so cool.

1815
02:09:56,790 --> 02:09:57,410
Wait, does he have one?

1816
02:09:58,650 --> 02:09:59,050
No.

1817
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:02,260
Whoa.

1818
02:10:02,460 --> 02:10:03,540
Ocean Guardian.

1819
02:10:07,830 --> 02:10:09,030
Corvus can solo!

1820
02:10:09,570 --> 02:10:10,290
That's insane.

1821
02:10:10,750 --> 02:10:12,070
Sada is good for being there.

1822
02:10:14,610 --> 02:10:15,730
I love this one.

1823
02:10:16,070 --> 02:10:17,970
This Yangshi is so cute!

1824
02:10:20,350 --> 02:10:21,970
I've never played a Sada.

1825
02:10:24,150 --> 02:10:24,670
Slashes.

1826
02:10:25,370 --> 02:10:26,790
Oh, can Pop Camo?

1827
02:10:28,090 --> 02:10:29,450
She's awesome.

1828
02:10:35,350 --> 02:10:36,470
She's so cute.

1829
02:10:39,610 --> 02:10:41,470
It's really good on most maps.

1830
02:10:43,530 --> 02:10:44,790
Someone said Gerardo.

1831
02:10:44,950 --> 02:10:45,590
Oh, here's Gerardo.

1832
02:10:46,630 --> 02:10:48,190
Oh, it's cute.

1833
02:10:49,270 --> 02:10:50,030
Gadgetier.

1834
02:10:51,770 --> 02:10:52,590
Paragon belt.

1835
02:10:52,990 --> 02:10:53,530
I'll be honest.

1836
02:10:53,550 --> 02:11:04,530
like I don't really read what they do it's probably bad
there's just so many effects there's so many I like striker

1837
02:11:04,530 --> 02:11:22,170
Jones too oh my god Octo Jones is so cute biker bones
Geraldo sells stuff he can use oh really I like Ben because

1851
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:22,760
Missius Izekiah on Hero of Iceberry.

1852
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:25,180
Super tough as at first, though.

1853
02:13:25,420 --> 02:13:27,400
Clown piece kicked my ass three times.

1854
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:29,320
Was this restaurant sim?

1855
02:13:29,480 --> 02:13:30,980
Oh god, that sounds so fun.

1856
02:13:31,100 --> 02:13:32,060
And there's lots of...

1857
02:13:32,060 --> 02:13:33,560
Holy moly, there's so much DLC.

1858
02:13:34,300 --> 02:13:35,680
Does this count as a fan game?

1859
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:41,360
I mean, it has so much content, but I guess it's a fan game,
though, right?

1860
02:13:48,500 --> 02:13:49,320
Not a fan game?

1861
02:13:52,080 --> 02:14:03,540
I do own it though After I was thinking because I'm like
trying to Figure out like a schedule ish type Of what I'm

1862
02:14:03,540 --> 02:14:12,580
doing for like longer Form games like right now I would say
Ghost Trick is like the Longer game I'm playing Right now I

1863
02:14:12,580 --> 02:14:14,740
think after Ghost Trick I'll play

1864
02:14:21,800 --> 02:14:24,680
Oh my god stop I just looked this up the other night.

1865
02:14:25,300 --> 02:14:27,060
And I couldn't remember the name of it the other night.

1866
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:28,860
I was like, I was like, no, wait.

1867
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:29,840
Hold on.

1868
02:14:32,220 --> 02:14:33,140
Oh my god.

1869
02:14:33,660 --> 02:14:34,500
My brain.

1870
02:14:35,660 --> 02:14:36,620
She plays Xenoblade.

1871
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:37,900
I actually do.

1872
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:41,100
Kameniki told me to play it, and I said I would.

1873
02:14:43,460 --> 02:14:45,640
So I think I have to play it.

1874
02:14:46,020 --> 02:14:52,740
But I'm hesitant to start such a huge, such a huge thing.

1875
02:14:53,180 --> 02:14:54,360
Right now.

1876
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:58,440
But Xenoblade will be eventually, most likely.

1877
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:01,460
They just finished translating the last DLC for the...

1878
02:15:01,460 --> 02:15:03,740
Two, the Izakaya team are super cracked for being so small.

1879
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:04,640
That's so awesome.

1880
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:05,880
Mike!

1881
02:15:06,140 --> 02:15:07,220
Thanks for the...

1882
02:15:07,220 --> 02:15:07,580
Pink!

1883
02:15:08,360 --> 02:15:10,020
This is the Purgatory Made Cafe.

1884
02:15:10,400 --> 02:15:15,600
We would like to inform you that in recognition of your
10,000th visit, you are now a Platinum Tier member.

1885
02:15:15,940 --> 02:15:20,560
However, we humbly request that on your next visit, you
cease to Wotage with the breadsticks.

1886
02:15:21,260 --> 02:15:22,860
You can't tell me what to do!

1887
02:15:24,680 --> 02:15:29,000
As your platinum member, I should have permission to vote
again with whatever I please.

1888
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:36,280
Even if it's like, even if I grab someone's feet and swing
the person around, like pen lights.

1889
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:40,680
Baking a cheesecake for my mom for Mother's Day.

1890
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:42,640
Never made one before, but it smells good in the oven.

1891
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:43,200
Wish me luck.

1892
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:44,160
Good luck.

1893
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:45,580
I've made cheesecake before.

1894
02:15:45,700 --> 02:15:46,460
It's not so difficult.

1895
02:15:47,420 --> 02:15:47,820
It's pretty good.

1896
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:49,660
It's pretty, it's not so bad.

1897
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:53,160
Okay.

1898
02:15:53,180 --> 02:15:56,820
Oh yeah, um, yeah, I'm not gonna buy anything right now.

1899
02:15:59,660 --> 02:16:00,520
I'm gonna switch the...

1900
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:01,980
Ride in Quincy.

1901
02:16:04,780 --> 02:16:06,420
What if I bought...

1902
02:16:06,420 --> 02:16:08,300
Oh, I wouldn't want to level up to 20, though.

1903
02:16:10,380 --> 02:16:11,620
Wolf pack Quincy.

1904
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:13,400
I'm gonna switch the Quincy, though, so we can...

1905
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:13,840
Are you kidding me?

1906
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:15,180
Nothing gets past my boat.

1907
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:16,320
So we can hear...

1908
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:17,080
Are you kidding me?

1909
02:16:17,620 --> 02:16:18,540
Are you kidding me?

1910
02:16:19,140 --> 02:16:20,160
Are you kidding me?

1911
02:16:23,180 --> 02:16:26,700
up but the highest round someone got was 3,275.

1912
02:16:26,840 --> 02:16:28,940
Now my round 250 seems small.

1913
02:16:30,420 --> 02:16:31,340
Thanks for streaming.

1914
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:32,320
I'm not done yet!

1915
02:16:32,560 --> 02:16:33,240
Sunday is my birthday.

1916
02:16:33,420 --> 02:16:34,120
Can I get a song?

1917
02:16:34,580 --> 02:16:36,160
Yeah, the Otage to recommend for beginners.

1918
02:16:36,420 --> 02:16:36,840
What would it be?

1919
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:41,980
Like, Otage move or Otage, like...

1920
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:46,240
Hold on, I'm gonna pick a thing real quick so I can stop
listening to the song.

1921
02:16:47,300 --> 02:16:50,060
Oh, the loop has a golden balloon, so let's do that one.

1922
02:16:52,180 --> 02:16:52,620
Um...

1923
02:16:53,180 --> 02:16:57,420
Do you mean like Otage as in like Tiger Fire, Cyber,
Fireball?

1924
02:16:58,040 --> 02:16:58,820
A move?

1925
02:16:59,300 --> 02:17:01,480
Or do you mean like...

1926
02:17:01,480 --> 02:17:02,420
Thunder Snake?

1927
02:17:03,140 --> 02:17:05,980
I don't know, I feel like Thunder Snake might be kind of
hard for people.

1928
02:17:06,940 --> 02:17:12,560
You can start with the simple stuff, like O-A-D and...

1929
02:17:17,910 --> 02:17:18,870
And, uh...

1930
02:17:18,870 --> 02:17:19,830
P-P-P-H.

1931
02:17:22,510 --> 02:17:23,470
And then...

1932
02:17:23,470 --> 02:17:25,490
But once you learn Thunder Snake, I'll admit you feel...

1933
02:17:25,510 --> 02:17:26,630
pretty cool doing it.

1934
02:17:28,930 --> 02:17:30,270
All in with Namaste, Snake.

1935
02:17:30,450 --> 02:17:31,250
That too.

1936
02:17:32,190 --> 02:17:35,390
Time to do it.

1937
02:17:35,530 --> 02:17:36,530
Otage Teaching Stream.

1938
02:17:37,150 --> 02:17:38,170
The day I get 3D.

1939
02:17:41,030 --> 02:17:44,310
I have to do that and I have to do a dance cover of
Umamushime.

1940
02:17:47,330 --> 02:17:48,710
I finally can do that.

1941
02:17:50,710 --> 02:17:53,730
If I get 3D, I'll actually have 3D.

1942
02:17:55,190 --> 02:17:57,570
so I can use it

1943
02:18:00,950 --> 02:18:15,450

yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes Shah, shah,
shah, shah!

1951
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:03,460
Easy peasy.

1952
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:08,600
On the chocolate river map, you can find monkeys hidden in
the map and you click them in the right order.

1953
02:19:10,180 --> 02:19:13,200
I think I have done that before.

1954
02:19:14,660 --> 02:19:15,620
I think I have done that before.

1955
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:22,460
Okay, guys, before we get any further, what are some
monkeys, not ice monkey, that we are trying to level up?

1956
02:19:22,460 --> 02:19:28,820
Like, TAC Monkey and Wizard Monkey!

1957
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:30,860
Okay, buy Wizard Monkey.

1958
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:34,000
Buy the Wizard Monkey.

1959
02:19:35,900 --> 02:19:37,160
Oh yeah!

1960
02:19:39,460 --> 02:19:42,460
I'm not listening to anything...

1961
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Anything that says Ice Monkey.

1962
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:50,300
Especially if Nanoplasm says Ice Monkey.

1963
02:19:53,240 --> 02:19:55,540
I don't even know if that person is still here.

1964
02:19:55,900 --> 02:19:57,460
I might have really made them mad.

1965
02:20:01,260 --> 02:20:02,920
I don't even know if

1966
02:20:06,690 --> 02:20:07,430
it's...

1967
02:20:07,430 --> 02:20:08,410
Ninja monkey.

1968
02:20:10,490 --> 02:20:11,530
Oh, um...

1969
02:20:11,530 --> 02:20:12,910
Because I want the blue jutsu.

1970
02:20:13,710 --> 02:20:14,610
Blue jutsu.

1971
02:20:15,210 --> 02:20:16,430
Have I been saying blue jutsu?

1972
02:20:16,570 --> 02:20:17,230
This whole time.

1973
02:20:18,230 --> 02:20:19,270
Blue jutsu.

1974
02:20:19,490 --> 02:20:23,010
Wow, he looks so awesome in this outfit though.

1975
02:20:23,630 --> 02:20:24,730
He looks cool there too though.

1976
02:20:24,750 --> 02:20:26,110
But this one's so cool!

1977
02:20:27,510 --> 02:20:28,030
Wow!

1978
02:20:29,870 --> 02:20:32,130
Oh, wait, that's the...

1979
02:20:34,390 --> 02:20:36,550
This guy's scratching his head like, why am I here?

1980
02:20:38,410 --> 02:20:39,810
Okay, do something, Wizard Monkey.

1981
02:20:41,490 --> 02:20:41,830
Uh-oh.

1982
02:20:42,130 --> 02:20:43,230
Wow, Wizard Monkey.

1983
02:20:43,610 --> 02:20:43,970
Wow.

1984
02:20:44,890 --> 02:20:47,110
Oh, we'll do the spikes here.

1985
02:20:48,710 --> 02:20:49,910
Oh my gosh, Wizard Monkey.

1986
02:20:50,810 --> 02:20:52,310
You really let the ball down there.

1987
02:20:54,430 --> 02:21:00,330
Okay, we'll put... I usually put We'll put this one in here,
but we'll wait for Spike's monkey.

1988
02:21:01,210 --> 02:21:02,050
We'll wait for Spike's monkey.

1989
02:21:02,390 --> 02:21:03,510
He can already evolve!

1990
02:21:04,610 --> 02:21:05,610
Intense magic.

1991
02:21:06,510 --> 02:21:08,190
Oh, he turned into a nerd!

1992
02:21:14,430 --> 02:21:16,730
Blizzard monkey is a 000 tower.

1993
02:21:18,930 --> 02:21:20,430
He's doing his best.

1994
02:21:23,030 --> 02:21:24,270
He became blind.

1995
02:21:26,990 --> 02:21:29,150
What is this astronaut monkey anyway?

1996
02:21:30,190 --> 02:21:31,290
I can't tell.

1997
02:21:31,490 --> 02:21:32,710
It looks like he's wearing a space suit.

1998
02:21:34,030 --> 02:21:34,030
Okay.

1999
02:21:34,470 --> 02:21:36,010
Attack monkey will be in the middle.

2000
02:21:36,650 --> 02:21:37,110
Here.

2001
02:21:38,090 --> 02:21:38,530
Here.

2002
02:21:39,990 --> 02:21:42,850
Oh, we also gotta do our submarines too, right?

2003
02:21:43,450 --> 02:21:45,730
Because we're trying to get...

2004
02:21:46,670 --> 02:21:47,570
Bluntoni... Wait, no.

2005
02:21:47,690 --> 02:21:51,150
We're trying to get a preemptive strike, right?

2006
02:21:51,290 --> 02:21:53,010
So I'm gonna put one guy in there too.

2007
02:21:54,790 --> 02:21:55,270
Ha!

2008
02:21:55,270 --> 02:21:56,230
Wow, Quincy.

2009
02:21:58,790 --> 02:21:59,270
Okay.

2010
02:22:05,780 --> 02:22:09,720
I've got a fever and the only cure is ice monkey.

2011
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:11,880
Are you actually sick?

2012
02:22:16,540 --> 02:22:19,840
Oh, I forgot to spend money on my intense magic.

2013
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:27,540
Alchemist monkey?

2014
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:30,980
What were we trying to level up for him?

2015
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:34,120
The top one though, right?

2016
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:40,740
I don't know where I want to put him yet though.

2017
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:44,300
Yeah, we were trying to do the top one.

2018
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:47,320
I do want to get this guy down too though.

2019
02:22:52,220 --> 02:22:56,820
My guide says 000 ice monkey is best in the corner where I
can't hit anything.

2020
02:22:57,380 --> 02:22:58,640
It's the best slide.

2021
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:05,200
Everyone has a 000 ice monkey on their map, obviously.

2022
02:23:08,140 --> 02:23:09,380
4 to Alka's OP.

2023
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:11,140
That's what we're trying to get here.

2024
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:12,900
But I don't know where to put him.

2025
02:23:17,800 --> 02:23:20,240
I guess I can put him here with everybody, right?

2026
02:23:20,480 --> 02:23:22,600
I can have him kind of like that.

2027
02:23:25,400 --> 02:23:26,360
Or maybe...

2028
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:28,660
Where will he cover most monkey ground?

2029
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:31,800
He broke monkey ground!

2030
02:23:33,140 --> 02:23:34,180
Ice monkey in bio.

2031
02:23:34,320 --> 02:23:34,960
Near Quincy?

2032
02:23:36,540 --> 02:23:38,180
So it's like right there, good.

2033
02:23:38,720 --> 02:23:39,320
I think.

2034
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:44,000
Okay.

2035
02:23:45,260 --> 02:23:46,620
Sneak up on him.

2036
02:23:47,620 --> 02:23:48,980
Sneak up on him.

2037
02:23:49,300 --> 02:23:49,940
Like, right.

2038
02:23:50,120 --> 02:23:52,000
Actually, I want enough space here.

2039
02:23:52,620 --> 02:23:53,900
So we'll put him right here.

2040
02:23:55,820 --> 02:23:58,160
I love when they're all really good friends.

2041
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:00,260
Oh.

2042
02:24:05,170 --> 02:24:06,770
I can't even tell if he's doing anything.

2043
02:24:08,930 --> 02:24:10,030
Some monkey is listening.

2044
02:24:10,090 --> 02:24:11,990
Look how cute he is in the little boat.

2045
02:24:12,450 --> 02:24:25,810
la la la la he's like rockin side to side he's so cute

2048
02:24:54,150 --> 02:24:59,630

here earlier who is spamming that they really wanted ice

2049
02:24:59,630 --> 02:25:04,630

2050
02:25:10,510 --> 02:25:15,610

2055

Shoot!

2056
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:34,620
I'm sure Ice Monkey is a really nice guy, okay?

2057
02:25:40,880 --> 02:25:41,760
Oh, the hearts.

2058
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:44,160
The hearts, I'm confused.

2059
02:25:44,300 --> 02:25:45,300
Do they grow more hearts?

2060
02:25:45,420 --> 02:25:46,980
Do they just regrow their layers?

2061
02:25:50,420 --> 02:25:52,140
Which monkey is your monkey sauna?

2062
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:02,400
Oh, they regrow.

2063
02:26:02,420 --> 02:26:05,200
So they regrow layers.

2064
02:26:05,400 --> 02:26:05,400
Oh,

2065
02:26:11,990 --> 02:26:12,390
yeah.

2066
02:26:12,650 --> 02:26:13,470
Oh, yeah.

2067
02:26:14,690 --> 02:26:15,530
Thank you for the Akasuba!

2068
02:26:17,570 --> 02:26:19,890
It could have used a little more ice monkey.

2069
02:26:20,810 --> 02:26:23,950
I gotta have more ice monkey, baby.

2070
02:26:24,210 --> 02:26:27,870
Why did you send an Akasuba for the ice monkey?

2071
02:26:39,830 --> 02:26:41,310
Why would you do that?

2072
02:26:41,610 --> 02:26:43,090
Why would you do that?

2073
02:26:44,210 --> 02:26:44,850
Why?

2074
02:26:44,850 --> 02:26:45,450
Why?

2075
02:26:48,550 --> 02:26:48,690
Why?

2076
02:26:49,990 --> 02:26:51,710
Balls in your court, Missy.

2077
02:26:52,050 --> 02:26:52,430
Oh no.

2078
02:26:53,830 --> 02:26:54,550
Can I even afford?

2079
02:26:54,610 --> 02:26:57,030
I can't even afford the ice monkey.

2080
02:26:57,510 --> 02:26:58,850
I can't even afford him.

2081
02:27:15,640 --> 02:27:17,580

Frozen bloons grow sharp icicles that can pop bloons that
touch them.

2096
02:28:17,460 --> 02:28:19,300
Freezes all regular bloons on screen.

2097
02:28:23,720 --> 02:28:25,920

Ice monkey sucks.

2113
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:13,380
Please sell it.

2114
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:14,040
Sorry.

2115
02:29:15,140 --> 02:29:15,580
Sorry.

2116
02:29:15,820 --> 02:29:17,980
If you want me to sell it, Aka Supa... No, I'm just kidding.

2117
02:29:18,020 --> 02:29:18,660
Please don't do that.

2118
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,140
Please don't do that.

2119
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:22,460
The ice monkey is not worth it.

2120
02:29:22,780 --> 02:29:23,660
It's not worth a bit.

2121
02:29:23,820 --> 02:29:24,180
Please.

2122
02:29:25,320 --> 02:29:30,400
Also, I love that ice monkey 000 get donated in streamlabs.

2123
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:40,220
One of the ice monkey freeze blast sound effects is similar
to the one the front fruit quench sounds.

2124
02:29:40,680 --> 02:29:41,660
Did I say French?

2125
02:29:42,420 --> 02:29:45,140
When slicing fruit in fruit ninja.

2126
02:29:47,400 --> 02:29:49,220
I have never played fruit ninja.

2127
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:50,500
Lily breeze.

2128
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:54,860
You're gonna have to keep that name until YouTube allows you
to change it back.

2129
02:29:54,860 --> 02:29:56,000
I'm just letting you know.

2130
02:30:00,160 --> 02:30:01,840
Okay, where are we at?

2131
02:30:02,700 --> 02:30:05,960
I want to have this guy out, so...

2132
02:30:05,960 --> 02:30:06,180
Ooh.

2133
02:30:08,600 --> 02:30:09,040
Ew.

2134
02:30:16,220 --> 02:30:17,520
Long reach, maybe.

2135
02:30:18,420 --> 02:30:20,100
But I want the bigger stacks, maybe.

2136
02:30:21,160 --> 02:30:21,440
Hmm.

2137
02:30:26,740 --> 02:30:27,520
Not there.

2138
02:30:27,860 --> 02:30:28,200
Oh my god.

2139
02:30:28,820 --> 02:30:29,440
Mike!

2140
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:32,800
Ice monkey.

2141
02:30:35,680 --> 02:30:36,480
Worth...

2142
02:30:36,480 --> 02:30:40,800
Carla, please sell the ice monkey and buy another one at...

2143
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:42,760
He's at 0-0-0!

2144
02:30:44,060 --> 02:30:45,480
I did an upgrade!

2145
02:30:49,560 --> 02:30:51,000
He's 0-0!

2146
02:30:51,080 --> 02:30:52,540
He has no upgrades!

2147
02:30:54,440 --> 02:30:56,080
He's zero already!

2148
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:00,120
Stop!

2149
02:31:01,600 --> 02:31:03,360
That's a bad one.

2150
02:31:04,220 --> 02:31:07,100
Yo, it's not worth a bit, you guys.

2151
02:31:07,980 --> 02:31:09,740
Go see the next for the five membership.

2152
02:31:12,040 --> 02:31:13,820
Sell the ice monkey.

2153
02:31:16,460 --> 02:31:19,400
Look, he's juggling with the ice, you guys.

2154
02:31:20,260 --> 02:31:22,020
How am I supposed to sell this?

2155
02:31:24,620 --> 02:31:25,140
Okay.

2156
02:31:31,220 --> 02:31:32,080
My god!

2157
02:31:33,300 --> 02:31:34,180
Keep him in.

2158
02:31:34,240 --> 02:31:35,220
Look at his greatness.

2159
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:37,680
Buy another zero, zero, zero, one.

2160
02:31:37,700 --> 02:31:39,200
after you sell it.

2161
02:31:44,540 --> 02:31:47,360
I said I was gonna keep from 0, 0, 0.

2162
02:31:49,540 --> 02:31:49,860
No!

2163
02:31:50,620 --> 02:31:52,400
I'd like to cancel Ice Monkey.

2164
02:31:53,200 --> 02:31:53,880
No!

2165
02:31:55,160 --> 02:31:56,620
You guys, please.

2166
02:31:57,100 --> 02:31:58,080
I'm serious.

2167
02:31:58,360 --> 02:31:59,160
It's not worth...

2168
02:31:59,160 --> 02:32:00,760
This is the dumbest bit ever.

2169
02:32:01,100 --> 02:32:02,220
It's not worth...

2170
02:32:02,220 --> 02:32:04,040
It's not worth sending this!

2171
02:32:06,060 --> 02:32:06,740
Okay.

2172
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:11,520
I'm going to continue on moving forward.

2173
02:32:12,060 --> 02:32:14,520
Okay, everybody, we're moving forward with our afterlives.

2174
02:32:15,720 --> 02:32:17,820
Oh, I'm moving forward with my afterlives.

2175
02:32:18,140 --> 02:32:19,800
I can't tell who's winning the bid war at this point.

2176
02:32:19,900 --> 02:32:20,640
Me neither.

2177
02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:22,280
Okay.

2178
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:30,520
If I sell this ice monkey and put him in the middle of the
field where he will be absolutely useless, will you guys

2179
02:32:30,520 --> 02:32:31,280
feel better?

2180
02:32:31,880 --> 02:32:35,320
So then I technically sold him and I bought another one.

2181
02:32:36,080 --> 02:32:37,220
Bye, bye, bye.

2182
02:32:37,700 --> 02:32:39,500
Ice, ice, ice.

2183
02:32:45,720 --> 02:32:46,760
Do it.

2184
02:32:47,160 --> 02:32:48,260
No, don't sell.

2185
02:32:48,880 --> 02:32:50,460
Zero, zero, zero in the middle.

2186
02:32:50,900 --> 02:32:52,060
He'll be the mascot.

2187
02:32:52,960 --> 02:32:54,600
But I'm worried he can't hurt anybody.

2188
02:32:59,900 --> 02:33:02,280
Ice, ice, baby.

2189
02:33:19,270 --> 02:33:19,790
Sweet.

2190
02:33:20,970 --> 02:33:22,950
I feel like I lost in the end.

2191
02:33:24,930 --> 02:33:26,830
I feel like...

2192
02:33:27,230 --> 02:33:28,650
I feel like I just got bullied.

2193
02:33:30,830 --> 02:33:31,670
Into...

2194
02:33:31,670 --> 02:33:32,910
Into this.

2195
02:33:33,630 --> 02:33:33,790
No.

2196
02:33:34,750 --> 02:33:37,370
I feel like...

2197
02:33:38,450 --> 02:33:38,870
Yeah.

2198
02:33:39,970 --> 02:33:41,370
Oh my gosh.

2199
02:33:41,770 --> 02:33:43,250
Ballistic missile.

2200
02:33:46,390 --> 02:33:47,450
Holy cow!

2201
02:33:58,620 --> 02:34:02,620
Membership lapsed midstream, so I was darnly not green.

2202
02:34:02,840 --> 02:34:04,280
Here's extra after reading.

2203
02:34:04,840 --> 02:34:06,600
I don't need extra, but thank you.

2204
02:34:07,940 --> 02:34:08,780
I

2205
02:34:19,270 --> 02:34:20,970
got two monkey bugs.

2206
02:34:23,010 --> 02:34:23,850
Yippee!

2207
02:34:25,450 --> 02:34:30,120
Gonna join the 30s gang on Tuesday.

2208
02:34:30,340 --> 02:34:33,220
Could you sing me a happy birthday song and a granny voice
with love, Bozo?

2209
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:38,380
Happy birthday to you.

2210
02:34:39,240 --> 02:34:40,280
Happy birthday.

2211
02:34:41,300 --> 02:34:42,280
Young man.

2212
02:34:42,940 --> 02:34:44,020
Happy birthday.

2213
02:34:44,940 --> 02:34:46,340
Dear Bozo.

2214
02:34:47,900 --> 02:34:48,740
Happy birthday.

2215
02:34:53,780 --> 02:35:09,320
you let's get the berserker brew after this i am quincy son

2216
02:35:09,320 --> 02:35:18,380
quincy so no he has an upgrade ice monkey wins by doing
nothing this is crazy

2217
02:35:23,560 --> 02:35:25,820
Ice Monkey has an upgrade!

2218
02:35:28,440 --> 02:35:28,960
I

2219
02:35:39,440 --> 02:35:40,660
don't even remember what this does.

2220
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:42,480
Oh yeah, that's right.

2221
02:35:50,620 --> 02:35:51,960
He's just juggling in the middle.

2222
02:35:54,760 --> 02:35:55,520
I am Quincy.

2223
02:35:55,840 --> 02:35:56,840
Son of Quincy.

2224
02:35:58,340 --> 02:35:58,680
Okay.

2225
02:35:59,240 --> 02:36:00,640
I can post this here.

2226
02:36:02,020 --> 02:36:06,820
If I put it right in the middle, can I still put monkeys on
the side?

2227
02:36:07,900 --> 02:36:09,460
Like a ninja monkey around.

2228
02:36:09,820 --> 02:36:13,700
Oh my gosh, can I put this in the middle and then decorate
him with ninja monkeys?

2229
02:36:21,420 --> 02:36:22,140
Not the last loop?

2230
02:36:22,260 --> 02:36:22,920
This loop instead?

2231
02:36:26,440 --> 02:36:27,160
Okay, Samson.

2232
02:36:27,420 --> 02:36:30,100
Samson's really, like, adamant of it.

2233
02:36:31,380 --> 02:36:32,040
Won't fit.

2234
02:36:32,160 --> 02:36:32,660
Are you sure?

2235
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:33,260
Oh, wait.

2236
02:36:33,360 --> 02:36:33,600
Hold on.

2237
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:35,340
Oh, I can't afford anything anymore.

2238
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:35,700
Hold on.

2239
02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:38,460
But we need these guys to level up, too.

2240
02:36:40,480 --> 02:36:42,860
We need these guys to get more experience also.

2241
02:36:44,460 --> 02:36:44,900
Ha!

2242
02:36:45,460 --> 02:36:45,680
Ha!

2243
02:36:49,120 --> 02:36:50,000
What was...

2244
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:50,980
So it was...

2245
02:36:50,980 --> 02:36:51,540
What was...

2246
02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:56,300
Magic shots last longer to seek out the balloons, even
behind cover.

2247
02:36:57,420 --> 02:36:58,680
Pop through two layers.

2248
02:36:59,440 --> 02:37:00,740
Oh no, I want the wall of fire.

2249
02:37:01,540 --> 02:37:01,880
I think.

2250
02:37:02,140 --> 02:37:03,160
We'll do the wall of fire.

2251
02:37:05,580 --> 02:37:06,020
Fireball.

2252
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:07,480
Fireball.

2253
02:37:15,620 --> 02:37:17,280
I'm sorry, I'm just enthusiastic.

2254
02:37:17,780 --> 02:37:19,140
It's okay, just try not to spam too much.

2255
02:37:22,220 --> 02:37:28,520
But I'm asking for help from you guys, so I don't mind the
backseating a little bit.

2256
02:37:39,900 --> 02:37:45,200
I'm going to do actually the stronger acid because I
remember someone saying the acid pool is not as good.

2257
02:37:46,440 --> 02:37:47,440
So we'll do that.

2258
02:37:49,080 --> 02:37:50,300
You want some?

2259
02:37:50,900 --> 02:37:52,360
You want some!

2260
02:37:57,030 --> 02:37:59,230
Ice Monkey Standing Center!

2261
02:38:00,010 --> 02:38:01,150
He's like, yeah!

2262
02:38:01,830 --> 02:38:03,870
And then when we win, he juggles.

2263
02:38:04,110 --> 02:38:05,290
It's so awesome!

2264
02:38:07,810 --> 02:38:08,850
My favorite intern.

2265
02:38:09,110 --> 02:38:09,390
Yay!

2266
02:38:09,550 --> 02:38:10,790
Juggle, monkey, juggle!

2267
02:38:13,010 --> 02:38:15,250
David, thanks for the five gifted.

2268
02:38:19,050 --> 02:38:20,850
I'm barely taking this one seriously.

2269
02:38:21,390 --> 02:38:22,570
I can barely concentrate.

2270
02:38:25,030 --> 02:38:26,230
I can barely concentrate.

2271
02:38:28,570 --> 02:38:29,570
He's so cute.

2272
02:38:29,730 --> 02:38:30,750
He is really cute.

2273
02:38:31,510 --> 02:38:32,170
He's pretty cute.

2274
02:38:33,050 --> 02:38:35,050
He's pretty cute.

2275
02:38:45,200 --> 02:38:47,700
Why is it so hard to place these?

2276
02:38:48,080 --> 02:38:48,700
Like, what the hell?

2277
02:39:00,620 --> 02:39:02,500
Ice Monkey got me distracted too.

2278
02:39:03,620 --> 02:39:05,160
Monkey Farms, you're right.

2279
02:39:09,670 --> 02:39:10,710
Oh, this has an upgrade.

2280
02:39:11,530 --> 02:39:13,390
We're gonna go for the faster production.

2281
02:39:15,570 --> 02:39:16,510
Ooh, it's purple.

2282
02:39:19,030 --> 02:39:21,710
Okay, I have no money, so...

2283
02:39:23,270 --> 02:39:25,690
Why do I juggle so fast?

2284
02:39:27,270 --> 02:39:28,610
Juggle, juggle, monkey!

2285
02:39:29,230 --> 02:39:30,090
Juggle, ice monkey!

2286
02:39:42,280 --> 02:39:44,420
Dark Sider, welcome to bamboo shop.

2287
02:39:44,620 --> 02:39:45,460
Thank you so much.

2288
02:39:45,740 --> 02:39:46,460
Thank you.

2289
02:39:47,220 --> 02:39:48,340
Holy cow.

2290
02:39:49,920 --> 02:39:52,320
Um, I think I was going for banana.

2291
02:39:53,900 --> 02:39:54,720
You want banana?

2292
02:39:54,900 --> 02:39:55,900
We have banana.

2293
02:39:56,340 --> 02:39:57,520
Banana crates?

2294
02:39:57,740 --> 02:39:58,800
We're 300 each.

2295
02:40:09,950 --> 02:40:10,570
Nice.

2296
02:40:12,290 --> 02:40:13,750
Wall of fire.

2297
02:40:14,990 --> 02:40:15,590
Nice.

2298
02:40:16,010 --> 02:40:17,290
So this one is 10 battle.

2299
02:40:17,330 --> 02:40:18,490
Wow, he looks so cool.

2300
02:40:19,050 --> 02:40:21,210
Okay, I need more money.

2301
02:40:21,210 --> 02:40:23,190
Oh, pop it, pop it, pop it!

2302
02:40:23,530 --> 02:40:25,410
Pop the golden cup!

2303
02:40:25,990 --> 02:40:28,970
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop it!

2304
02:40:29,750 --> 02:40:30,350
Yippee!

2305
02:40:33,330 --> 02:40:34,070
Okay, nice.

2306
02:40:36,310 --> 02:40:37,950
It's also the banana bank.

2307
02:40:38,390 --> 02:40:38,910
Which one's that?

2308
02:40:40,050 --> 02:40:41,530
The Wall Street one?

2309
02:40:44,770 --> 02:40:48,830
Hub of Monkey Trades earns colossal income, generates lives
each round.

2310
02:40:49,050 --> 02:40:49,630
What?

2311
02:40:52,690 --> 02:40:54,130
Two more dollars.

2312
02:40:54,390 --> 02:40:57,710
Hey, two dollars is two dollars that I did not spend with my
real money.

2313
02:41:00,090 --> 02:41:01,050
Even faster.

2314
02:41:05,770 --> 02:41:07,110
Bank is the middle.

2315
02:41:08,070 --> 02:41:08,550
Monkeyomics?

2316
02:41:10,270 --> 02:41:14,610
Oh, all money generated in this farm is now stored in the
bank and earns 15%.

2317
02:41:14,610 --> 02:41:15,130
Oh!

2318
02:41:16,770 --> 02:41:18,270
I see, I see, I see.

2319
02:41:19,050 --> 02:41:20,230
Okay, I'll do another one.

2320
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:23,480
Okay.

2321
02:41:24,060 --> 02:41:25,240
And we'll go for the middle path.

2322
02:41:28,840 --> 02:41:30,140
Gold balloon for you.

2323
02:41:30,280 --> 02:41:31,040
Oh, thank you.

2324
02:41:32,320 --> 02:41:33,940
Missed, wow, Falcon of Membership.

2325
02:41:34,040 --> 02:41:35,140
Thank you so much.

2326
02:41:36,840 --> 02:41:39,200
Oh, this map is making me wish it was fall.

2327
02:41:39,560 --> 02:41:40,520
Okay, uh-oh.

2328
02:41:42,340 --> 02:41:45,580
I just realized, aren't we have a lot of balloons getting
through.

2329
02:41:47,460 --> 02:41:48,760
Watch out for the Moab.

2330
02:41:48,880 --> 02:41:50,780
We have a lot of balloons getting through.

2331
02:41:50,800 --> 02:41:52,380
Why do I think we're in trouble?

2332
02:41:54,840 --> 02:41:56,700
I think we're a bit in trouble.

2333
02:42:00,280 --> 02:42:01,520
We'll do the wall of fire at least.

2334
02:42:01,660 --> 02:42:03,080
And even the faster production.

2335
02:42:07,980 --> 02:42:08,780
What's this one?

2336
02:42:08,960 --> 02:42:11,460
Collect a radius of bananas is larger.

2337
02:42:17,220 --> 02:42:18,580
Uncollected bananas auto-collect.

2338
02:42:24,130 --> 02:42:25,250
Nah, I'd rather have more.

2339
02:42:27,470 --> 02:42:28,430
Nah, you'd win.

2340
02:42:31,790 --> 02:42:33,350
Did you play this on stream with Mata?

2341
02:42:33,630 --> 02:42:35,630
Actually, I would love to if she wants to.

2342
02:42:35,850 --> 02:42:38,770
But I think we might be like, Put this monkey here.

2343
02:42:39,050 --> 02:42:40,410
Now, put this monkey here.

2344
02:42:40,810 --> 02:42:42,090
Is Engineer monkey good?

2345
02:42:45,130 --> 02:42:46,490
Maybe we should get him too.

2346
02:42:47,470 --> 02:42:48,410
I haven't used him once.

2347
02:42:49,210 --> 02:42:50,710
And I haven't really used the Druid monkey.

2348
02:42:50,770 --> 02:42:51,870
Oh, I have a little bit.

2349
02:42:52,750 --> 02:42:53,290
I lied.

2350
02:42:53,710 --> 02:42:54,130
I lied.

2351
02:42:54,250 --> 02:42:54,570
I lied.

2352
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:13,820
good engineer gaming okay if i put him like here kind of as
like a defense at the end of the you know the end of the the

2353
02:43:13,820 --> 02:43:22,840
end of the end of the line top path engineer goaded with the
sentry that's the one i was looking at because it kind of

2354
02:43:22,840 --> 02:43:28,180
seems fun removes camo and regrow and pops Wow.

2355
02:43:32,240 --> 02:43:33,140
Engineer puts more gun.

2356
02:43:33,380 --> 02:43:34,560
I love gun!

2357
02:43:35,900 --> 02:43:38,100
But how far do they reach, you know?

2358
02:43:49,780 --> 02:43:50,820
Bottom's good for money.

2359
02:43:51,600 --> 02:43:52,980
I think we're good for money right now.

2360
02:43:55,980 --> 02:43:56,840
A decent range?

2361
02:43:57,240 --> 02:43:58,880
So I don't have to put him right here then.

2362
02:43:59,280 --> 02:44:00,100
I could put him like here.

2363
02:44:00,760 --> 02:44:04,640
And he's kind of like building his little sentries and
they're like...

2364
02:44:11,760 --> 02:44:12,760
Average range.

2365
02:44:13,100 --> 02:44:13,780
Put them where Quincy is.

2366
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:14,240
Oh, okay.

2367
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:16,680
Like here.

2368
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:17,950
So here actually then.

2369
02:44:20,060 --> 02:44:20,680
Yeah, basically.

2370
02:44:21,180 --> 02:44:22,060
Not that much of a range.

2371
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:22,500
Okay.

2372
02:44:23,340 --> 02:44:23,820
The engineer.

2373
02:44:24,120 --> 02:44:31,620
Yeah, but he'll build in his range, but But the sentries can
shoot wherever, right?

2374
02:44:32,460 --> 02:44:37,040
So or the sentries can only shoot in the little circle that
he's in is what I'm asking

2375
02:44:46,240 --> 02:44:50,880
Oh, he gets the buff here, so Centries have their own range.

2376
02:44:51,240 --> 02:44:53,740
Ah, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2377
02:44:53,740 --> 02:44:56,860
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2378
02:44:56,860 --> 02:44:58,900
You can become huge with the middle one.

2379
02:45:00,760 --> 02:45:01,640
Longer range.

2380
02:45:03,660 --> 02:45:06,720
I wish sometimes you could, like, I wish sometimes it wasn't
just a circle.

2381
02:45:07,160 --> 02:45:09,540
Like, I wish I could make a rectangle, you know.

2382
02:45:11,920 --> 02:45:13,520
Circles in this game are so hard.

2383
02:45:15,900 --> 02:45:17,360
How you doing, Ice Monkey?

2384
02:45:18,420 --> 02:45:18,860
Okay.

2385
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:22,300
Are you working hard or are you hardly working?

2386
02:45:26,080 --> 02:45:26,560
You know what?

2387
02:45:26,560 --> 02:45:32,260
I don't have any snipers, so let's add a sniper right here.

2388
02:45:36,320 --> 02:45:36,800
Right here.

2389
02:45:38,040 --> 02:45:39,180
Actually, okay, hold on.

2390
02:45:39,740 --> 02:45:40,520
How do I want to do this?

2391
02:45:40,640 --> 02:45:43,200
Because I also want to add a village.

2392
02:45:44,180 --> 02:45:48,040
We could put the village right here and sniper monkeys and
then some guys down here, probably.

2393
02:45:48,960 --> 02:45:49,240
Hmm.

2394
02:45:53,750 --> 02:45:54,710
Incoming!

2395
02:45:56,390 --> 02:45:57,630
Oh, we're fine.

2396
02:45:58,670 --> 02:45:59,250
I think.

2397
02:46:01,370 --> 02:46:01,830
Yeah.

2398
02:46:02,690 --> 02:46:03,330
All right.

2399
02:46:04,210 --> 02:46:05,630
Yeah, we're fine.

2400
02:46:05,910 --> 02:46:06,390
We're fine.

2401
02:46:06,570 --> 02:46:07,130
We're fine.

2402
02:46:08,890 --> 02:46:10,450
I need more money.

2403
02:46:20,480 --> 02:46:21,820
All right.

2404
02:46:22,300 --> 02:46:23,740
All right.

2405
02:46:28,670 --> 02:46:30,450
It's like the dune...

2406
02:46:30,450 --> 02:46:32,650
It's like the dune popcorn bucket.

2407
02:46:34,750 --> 02:46:35,710
Right?

2408
02:46:36,350 --> 02:46:37,290
Just me?

2409
02:46:38,350 --> 02:46:38,770
Okay.

2410
02:46:39,770 --> 02:46:40,190
Yeah.

2411
02:46:41,950 --> 02:46:46,270
Um, I'm gonna do bigger because I don't think I need to
reach longer.

2412
02:46:46,450 --> 02:46:47,030
I think we're okay.

2413
02:46:47,750 --> 02:46:48,910
Let's do bigger stocks.

2414
02:46:49,450 --> 02:46:51,810
Actually, no, I'm gonna hold out.

2415
02:46:58,540 --> 02:46:59,760
Why are you guys saying ha?

2416
02:47:03,240 --> 02:47:04,400
What are you saying ha for?

2417
02:47:06,400 --> 02:47:07,800
Looks just like it, I think.

2418
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:12,800
Holy moly, we have so much money!

2419
02:47:14,400 --> 02:47:16,440
I wish I could upgrade you.

2420
02:47:17,440 --> 02:47:18,140
Close though, we're close.

2421
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:19,160
Let's see.

2422
02:47:19,320 --> 02:47:19,560
What else?

2423
02:47:19,860 --> 02:47:21,840
Um, stronger stimulant.

2424
02:47:25,320 --> 02:47:25,900
Shimmer.

2425
02:47:30,800 --> 02:47:31,820
I am Quincy.

2426
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:32,480
Yeah, I know.

2427
02:47:32,740 --> 02:47:33,300
Son of Quincy.

2428
02:47:33,680 --> 02:47:34,960
I am Quincy.

2429
02:47:35,660 --> 02:47:36,640
Son of Quincy.

2430
02:47:37,560 --> 02:47:39,420
Let's go for the Moab here.

2431
02:47:40,040 --> 02:47:44,380
And I'm going to actually do faster firing because we have
the intent of building a village right now.

2432
02:47:44,400 --> 02:47:51,720
there so don't necessarily need currently

2433
02:47:55,390 --> 02:48:12,490
spend it all on ice monkey we're rich baby I just need them
to generate a little oh wait I can still do the same thing

2434
02:48:12,490 --> 02:48:15,390
even though we're taking different paths with each one of
them.

2435
02:48:15,390 --> 02:48:16,530
I just realized.

2436
02:48:21,930 --> 02:48:22,930
Oh yeah!

2437
02:48:23,490 --> 02:48:24,850
That's what I'm talking about.

2438
02:48:26,110 --> 02:48:31,080
I think your spikes are stale.

2439
02:48:31,520 --> 02:48:31,820
What?

2440
02:48:33,100 --> 02:48:34,600
Why do you think that?

2441
02:48:41,310 --> 02:48:43,340
They're actually really great!

2442
02:48:44,700 --> 02:48:45,860
Monkey bank!

2443
02:48:46,580 --> 02:48:48,020
Monkey bank!

2444
02:48:48,640 --> 02:48:49,700
Monkey bank!

2445
02:48:49,820 --> 02:48:50,560
Monkey bank!

2446
02:48:51,020 --> 02:48:51,920
Monkey bank!

2447
02:48:52,980 --> 02:48:55,280
The middle path druid is very broken.

2448
02:48:55,880 --> 02:48:56,340
This guy?

2449
02:48:57,680 --> 02:48:57,840
Really?

2450
02:48:57,980 --> 02:48:59,580
I always go for the top one.

2451
02:49:03,220 --> 02:49:05,100
Dang, he generates a life and cash?

2452
02:49:08,140 --> 02:49:12,120
But see, this one, like the druid, this one, it only...

2453
02:49:12,120 --> 02:49:14,120
He only gets one balloon at a time.

2454
02:49:15,320 --> 02:49:15,760
Rosado!

2455
02:49:16,200 --> 02:49:17,520
Welcome to membership, thank you!

2456
02:49:17,740 --> 02:49:18,360
Middle is OP.

2457
02:49:19,180 --> 02:49:20,140
Okay, we'll add him.

2458
02:49:21,660 --> 02:49:22,560
Let's try him out.

2459
02:49:23,900 --> 02:49:24,420
Rise.

2460
02:49:28,040 --> 02:49:29,220
We'll put you right...

2461
02:49:29,220 --> 02:49:29,980
Look at him waving.

2462
02:49:33,180 --> 02:49:34,520
He's strong trust.

2463
02:49:36,220 --> 02:49:37,240
Next to the bank?

2464
02:49:37,680 --> 02:49:38,100
Like here?

2465
02:49:38,240 --> 02:49:38,440
Wait.

2466
02:49:38,840 --> 02:49:39,760
What is the upgrade?

2467
02:49:39,980 --> 02:49:40,860
I'm confused now.

2468
02:49:41,420 --> 02:49:42,060
Generates cash.

2469
02:49:42,120 --> 02:49:45,580
Cash each use plus extra cash per banana farm.

2470
02:49:46,440 --> 02:49:47,200
Oh my god.

2471
02:49:47,360 --> 02:49:47,660
Oh my god.

2472
02:49:47,820 --> 02:49:48,040
Oh my god.

2473
02:49:48,080 --> 02:49:48,280
Wait.

2474
02:49:48,320 --> 02:49:49,460
Does this count as near?

2475
02:49:52,100 --> 02:49:52,620
Oh.

2476
02:49:55,420 --> 02:49:56,260
Let's go.

2477
02:50:00,200 --> 02:50:02,660
Oh, the old bin buffs the druids.

2478
02:50:02,920 --> 02:50:04,220
I do remember that, actually.

2479
02:50:05,180 --> 02:50:05,840
Give us money.

2480
02:50:09,340 --> 02:50:09,620
Whoa!

2481
02:50:09,980 --> 02:50:11,080
He got rid of all of those.

2482
02:50:11,180 --> 02:50:12,020
That was really crazy.

2483
02:50:14,200 --> 02:50:14,800
Oh, yeah.

2484
02:50:15,080 --> 02:50:15,700
Oh, yeah!

2485
02:50:16,980 --> 02:50:17,660
Good job, Quincy.

2486
02:50:17,780 --> 02:50:18,320
Son of Quincy.

2487
02:50:19,300 --> 02:50:19,980
I'm doing deadly.

2488
02:50:20,220 --> 02:50:21,480
I'm doing the precision with this one.

2489
02:50:22,100 --> 02:50:25,140
Oh, I should have should have bought the monkey bank.

2490
02:50:25,260 --> 02:50:25,700
But that's okay.

2491
02:50:26,460 --> 02:50:28,200
What are you doing anyway?

2492
02:50:39,200 --> 02:50:41,740
Ah, look on the membership, thank you so much.

2493
02:50:42,640 --> 02:50:43,800
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2494
02:50:44,240 --> 02:50:45,860
Okay, we need jungles bounty.

2495
02:50:46,380 --> 02:50:47,440
Oh, we're so close though.

2496
02:50:48,160 --> 02:50:48,440
Awesome.

2497
02:50:50,780 --> 02:50:51,040
Go!

2498
02:50:51,180 --> 02:50:51,580
Get it!

2499
02:50:51,820 --> 02:50:51,860
Get it!

2500
02:50:52,200 --> 02:50:52,980
Get the cow!

2501
02:50:53,120 --> 02:50:53,760
Get the cow!

2502
02:50:53,800 --> 02:50:54,080
Yeah!

2503
02:50:55,020 --> 02:50:56,360
Two real bucks.

2504
02:50:57,640 --> 02:50:58,960
We want the real bucks.

2505
02:50:59,200 --> 02:50:59,680
Monkey!

2506
02:51:00,980 --> 02:51:02,180
Thanks for the 20!

2507
02:51:02,340 --> 02:51:03,020
Thank you so much.

2508
02:51:03,100 --> 02:51:03,640
We're super done.

2509
02:51:06,180 --> 02:51:09,340
Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey.

2510
02:51:15,300 --> 02:51:17,360
This location, I feel like, kind of sucks.

2511
02:51:17,540 --> 02:51:18,220
He's just really random.

2512
02:51:19,260 --> 02:51:21,440
He's just randomly there, but that's okay, too.

2513
02:51:28,250 --> 02:51:29,190
Is that all you got?

2514
02:51:30,950 --> 02:51:33,950
Wow, he was really strangling that guy right there.

2515
02:51:34,990 --> 02:51:36,990
Hayden, thank you so much for the five gifted.

2516
02:51:38,110 --> 02:51:38,770
Thank you.

2517
02:51:38,830 --> 02:51:40,010
Oh, my gosh.

2518
02:51:40,270 --> 02:51:42,250
Just noticed how much money we have.

2519
02:51:43,570 --> 02:51:46,310
Bank, bank, bank, bank, bank.

2520
02:51:46,670 --> 02:51:48,090
Wait, should I do bank on both?

2521
02:51:48,870 --> 02:51:50,070
Now I'm conflicted.

2522
02:51:51,250 --> 02:51:52,670
No, I wanted a plantation.

2523
02:51:55,150 --> 02:51:56,670
I wanted the whole field.

2524
02:52:01,180 --> 02:52:03,020
Oh, we are making bank now, baby.

2525
02:52:06,260 --> 02:52:08,060
The monkey economy.

2526
02:52:08,480 --> 02:52:09,240
Monkey economy.

2527
02:52:10,320 --> 02:52:10,860
Potato!

2528
02:52:12,280 --> 02:52:13,700
Thank you for the tag gift.

2529
02:52:14,920 --> 02:52:17,440
Potato, potato, potato.

2530
02:52:21,220 --> 02:52:22,620
He's still hitting balloons.

2531
02:52:23,140 --> 02:52:23,940
Oh my gosh, you're right.

2532
02:52:24,480 --> 02:52:25,720
How is he hitting them?

2533
02:52:29,760 --> 02:52:31,660
Oh, from over here.

2534
02:52:31,760 --> 02:52:32,560
That's crazy.

2535
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:35,980
Is there anything else I can buy?

2536
02:52:36,620 --> 02:52:36,980
Yeah?

2537
02:52:39,400 --> 02:52:41,040
Everything I'm waiting on upgrades.

2538
02:52:41,200 --> 02:52:42,080
Oh, except you.

2539
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,140
Okay, maybe the spikes aren't so bad.

2540
02:52:50,480 --> 02:52:51,000
Headshot.

2541
02:52:52,240 --> 02:52:54,520
Hey chat, Quincy is so obnoxious.

2542
02:52:57,620 --> 02:52:58,340
Oh, Quincy.

2543
02:52:59,120 --> 02:52:59,980
Quincy, Quincy.

2544
02:53:00,180 --> 02:53:01,000
I don't like this one, though.

2545
02:53:01,100 --> 02:53:02,780
I don't like the $9,000 loan.

2546
02:53:03,320 --> 02:53:04,580
I don't want to be owing anybody.

2547
02:53:05,060 --> 02:53:06,860
I think that's why I didn't go for the middle one.

2548
02:53:07,620 --> 02:53:09,280
But I really like this one.

2549
02:53:12,200 --> 02:53:13,100
Oh, wizard monkey.

2550
02:53:13,960 --> 02:53:15,900
No, we're still waiting on the necromancer monkey.

2551
02:53:25,590 --> 02:53:26,890
Why is there a monkey in the middle?

2552
02:53:26,910 --> 02:53:27,990
not able to do anything.

2553
02:53:28,650 --> 02:53:30,070
He's our mascot monkey.

2554
02:53:31,230 --> 02:53:32,410
He's mascot monkey.

2555
02:53:32,590 --> 02:53:33,210
He doesn't do anything.

2556
02:53:33,430 --> 02:53:33,930
Is that all you got?

2557
02:53:35,150 --> 02:53:36,990
Oh, 200 monkey money!

2558
02:53:38,130 --> 02:53:39,010
Holy cow.

2559
02:53:40,450 --> 02:53:41,470
It's a lot of monkey money.

2560
02:53:43,490 --> 02:53:44,830
Yeah, he's just there to be cute.

2561
02:53:45,210 --> 02:53:46,210
He doesn't have to do anything.

2562
02:53:47,810 --> 02:53:48,170
What are they?

2563
02:53:48,250 --> 02:53:49,770
What is something else that I need to level up?

2564
02:53:50,170 --> 02:53:52,970
I haven't really used Super Monkey all that much.

2565
02:53:54,790 --> 02:53:56,250
Oh, we were going to do Engineer Monkey.

2566
02:53:57,790 --> 02:54:01,590
In fact, what we were gonna do, Sentry Engineer.

2567
02:54:03,950 --> 02:54:05,630
We're just gonna put him right up there.

2568
02:54:06,170 --> 02:54:07,350
Alright, go, monkey!

2569
02:54:13,570 --> 02:54:14,210
Moab!

2570
02:54:14,750 --> 02:54:15,590
Handle it!

2571
02:54:19,360 --> 02:54:20,000
Reach.

2572
02:54:20,940 --> 02:54:22,780
10% attack speed for it.

2573
02:54:24,980 --> 02:54:26,700
Maybe I'll just do this one.

2574
02:54:30,690 --> 02:54:31,850
Close, though, close.

2575
02:54:40,340 --> 02:54:42,620
Oh my gosh, we have money in here!

2576
02:54:45,820 --> 02:54:47,100
Alright, indeed!

2577
02:54:50,340 --> 02:54:54,560
Quincy's dead father is available as a redeemable item in
this shop.

2578
02:54:55,300 --> 02:54:57,140
That's so messed up!

2579
02:54:57,640 --> 02:54:59,060
Wait, what?

2580
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:02,560
Alright.

2581
02:55:03,740 --> 02:55:05,140
Don't forget to collect your bank money.

2582
02:55:05,320 --> 02:55:08,520
But, if it's stuff in the bank, doesn't it, like...

2583
02:55:08,520 --> 02:55:08,600
Yeah.

2584
02:55:08,620 --> 02:55:12,400
Yeah, earns 15% interest.

2585
02:55:13,280 --> 02:55:16,400
I think we should wait until we get it to 9,000, right?

2586
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:20,440
It's Quincy Senior.

2587
02:55:23,260 --> 02:55:25,360
What is this game?

2588
02:55:26,560 --> 02:55:28,520
Nice, we got the shredder.

2589
02:55:30,320 --> 02:55:31,600
Yeah, shredder.

2590
02:55:32,980 --> 02:55:34,000
What next?

2591
02:55:34,260 --> 02:55:34,880
What next?

2592
02:55:35,060 --> 02:55:36,680
Actually, I'm going to add another sniper monkey.

2593
02:55:38,620 --> 02:55:40,500
Oh, actually, no, no, no, no, no, sorry.

2594
02:55:44,680 --> 02:55:45,380
Put you here.

2595
02:55:45,960 --> 02:55:48,700
And then another sniper monkey right next to you.

2596
02:55:49,660 --> 02:55:50,760
So you, okay.

2597
02:55:52,420 --> 02:55:55,360
Will become the monkey business.

2598
02:55:56,700 --> 02:55:57,580
And bigger radius.

2599
02:56:00,120 --> 02:56:03,140
And then we can also put monkeys down here that will be able
to.

2600
02:56:03,220 --> 02:56:06,060
And so this guy, these guys can become like...

2601
02:56:06,060 --> 02:56:07,740
This guy can be our fast monkey.

2602
02:56:08,300 --> 02:56:09,620
The fastest monkey in the West.

2603
02:56:11,720 --> 02:56:13,060
Get it!

2604
02:56:13,800 --> 02:56:14,700
Get it!

2605
02:56:17,070 --> 02:56:18,490
Two monkey bucks.

2606
02:56:21,590 --> 02:56:23,150
How's our little engineer guy doing?

2607
02:56:25,030 --> 02:56:26,530
I don't even know what he's doing.

2608
02:56:27,630 --> 02:56:29,110
He's killed 141.

2609
02:56:29,330 --> 02:56:29,770
You want some?

2610
02:56:30,230 --> 02:56:31,410
You want some?

2611
02:56:33,650 --> 02:56:36,750
This guy is... the druid is cracked.

2612
02:56:41,770 --> 02:56:42,510
Incoming!

2613
02:56:42,930 --> 02:56:43,610
What's this do?

2614
02:56:44,650 --> 02:56:46,050
You can all have some.

2615
02:56:47,730 --> 02:56:48,210
Headshot.

2616
02:56:48,990 --> 02:56:49,810
You want some?

2617
02:56:50,190 --> 02:56:51,970
You can all have some.

2618
02:56:53,070 --> 02:56:53,810
I can't.

2619
02:56:54,010 --> 02:56:54,630
I can't.

2620
02:56:55,610 --> 02:56:57,150
The engineer's a pain in the butt to level.

2621
02:56:57,790 --> 02:56:58,770
Well, that's why he's here.

2622
02:56:59,030 --> 02:56:59,390
Oh my god.

2623
02:56:59,530 --> 02:57:00,910
She's killing nothing.

2624
02:57:02,210 --> 02:57:03,670
You can lower Quincy's voice.

2625
02:57:03,850 --> 02:57:05,270
No, I turned it up on purpose.

2626
02:57:06,070 --> 02:57:07,670
Because I think it's kind of funny.

2627
02:57:19,320 --> 02:57:20,520
Something sounds wet.

2628
02:57:20,640 --> 02:57:21,700
And I don't know what it is.

2629
02:57:22,260 --> 02:57:23,260
What's that wet sound?

2630
02:57:31,200 --> 02:57:33,580
Also, oh, let's get the boat in here, too.

2631
02:57:33,720 --> 02:57:36,240
Oh my gosh, wait, I only have two rounds left.

2632
02:57:37,400 --> 02:57:39,640
I think I meant to put the boat in sooner.

2633
02:57:40,420 --> 02:57:41,460
I completely forgot.

2634
02:57:44,440 --> 02:57:45,080
My bad.

2635
02:57:45,480 --> 02:57:45,940
Oh, well.

2636
02:57:49,200 --> 02:57:50,720
Oh, is the alchemist doing it?

2637
02:57:50,860 --> 02:57:51,060
Probably.

2638
02:57:58,210 --> 02:57:59,110
There he comes.

2639
02:57:59,910 --> 02:58:00,910
I can hear him.

2640
02:58:02,770 --> 02:58:04,310
Oh my gosh, it broke?

2641
02:58:05,210 --> 02:58:07,010
They destroyed it off stream.

2642
02:58:07,790 --> 02:58:08,530
Or off the screen.

2643
02:58:13,090 --> 02:58:13,990
Free play!

2644
02:58:17,070 --> 02:58:18,910
Oh man, Buccaneer.

2645
02:58:19,150 --> 02:58:20,950
I forgot to put you in.

2646
02:58:21,110 --> 02:58:23,590
And now it's going to take forever to get you leveled up.

2647
02:58:35,300 --> 02:58:36,230
Let's see.

2648
02:58:37,510 --> 02:58:38,190
Let's just keep going.

2649
02:58:39,690 --> 02:58:40,870
Is that all you got?

2650
02:58:41,270 --> 02:58:42,450
Is that all you got?

2651
02:58:48,060 --> 02:58:48,860
Oh, yeah.

2652
02:58:49,940 --> 02:58:51,800
I like the way he's, like, squeezing him.

2653
02:58:53,460 --> 02:58:54,360
With the vines.

2654
02:58:56,960 --> 02:58:57,320
Ugh.

2655
02:58:57,860 --> 02:58:59,480
That makes me almost want to restart.

2656
02:58:59,660 --> 02:59:01,240
Because I want the nature's bounty.

2657
02:59:01,480 --> 02:59:02,480
I want the bounty, man.

2658
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:03,680
Check the bank, too.

2659
02:59:03,760 --> 02:59:05,140
We still have a good amount in here.

2660
02:59:05,720 --> 02:59:05,980
You know what?

2661
02:59:05,980 --> 02:59:06,960
I'll collect it at this point.

2662
02:59:09,380 --> 02:59:10,180
14,000.

2663
02:59:11,440 --> 02:59:12,500
Heck yeah.

2664
02:59:13,220 --> 02:59:14,520
I wish I could buy experience.

2665
02:59:14,940 --> 02:59:16,340
I mean, you can with real money.

2666
02:59:16,640 --> 02:59:18,760
But I wish I could with my monkey bucks.

2667
02:59:23,310 --> 02:59:28,150
For 5,000 monkey XP, it's $1 USD.

2668
02:59:30,510 --> 02:59:31,710
$1 USD.

2669
02:59:37,410 --> 02:59:39,330
7k might be max in an unboosted bank.

2670
02:59:39,710 --> 02:59:40,950
Oh, well, good thing we collected at that.

2671
02:59:46,800 --> 02:59:48,520
Just play the game.

2672
02:59:49,500 --> 02:59:51,280
There's no rush, right?

2673
02:59:51,820 --> 02:59:53,540
So I guess if you're really impatient.

2674
02:59:54,520 --> 02:59:56,800
Mr. Alpaisy, thanks for the 10 gifted.

2675
02:59:57,300 --> 02:59:58,320
Thank you so much.

2676
03:00:01,260 --> 03:00:03,480
If it was zero dollars, I'd buy.

2677
03:00:08,350 --> 03:00:09,750
Mint, do you want a dollar?

2678
03:00:10,310 --> 03:00:10,690
No.

2679
03:00:13,730 --> 03:00:14,290
No.

2680
03:00:16,930 --> 03:00:17,270
No.

2681
03:00:25,360 --> 03:00:25,920
No.

2682
03:00:31,560 --> 03:00:33,340
Our Monkey Village.

2683
03:00:35,060 --> 03:00:38,540
Radius gets tier one upgrades for free, for free.

2684
03:00:39,060 --> 03:00:42,100
Increased range and reduced ability cooldowns.

2685
03:00:44,540 --> 03:00:46,640
What if you sold Ice Monkey for a dollar?

2686
03:00:46,800 --> 03:00:48,040
Ice Monkey is priceless.

2687
03:00:50,160 --> 03:00:52,220
Ice Monkey is priceless, what do you mean?

2688
03:00:54,160 --> 03:00:55,200
Blur-dud-dum-dum.

2689
03:00:56,140 --> 03:01:05,800

03:01:29,180 --> 03:01:31,560
No, I don't have them upgraded at all.

2694
03:01:32,400 --> 03:01:34,600
I have used them, but not very much.

2695
03:01:36,140 --> 03:01:36,540
Hmm.

2696
03:01:41,950 --> 03:01:44,150
I'll hit camos and do more damage.

2697
03:01:47,930 --> 03:01:49,090
Dark storm is OP.

2698
03:01:49,290 --> 03:01:50,970
Not everything can be OP, you guys.

2699
03:01:52,550 --> 03:01:53,330
This is goaded.

2700
03:01:53,650 --> 03:01:54,430
This is goaded.

2701
03:01:55,010 --> 03:01:55,650
This is goaded.

2702
03:01:58,110 --> 03:01:59,230

2703
03:01:59,850 --> 03:02:00,770

2707
03:02:40,730 --> 03:02:44,010
So I just fixed him there and I was setting on these two.

2708
03:02:52,180 --> 03:02:52,680
You know what?

2709
03:02:52,720 --> 03:02:53,580
I'm gonna set him up.

2710
03:02:54,580 --> 03:02:58,160
I'm gonna put him right next to Ice Monkey.

2711
03:02:59,720 --> 03:03:01,320
He's protecting Ice Monkey.

2712
03:03:02,040 --> 03:03:04,200
I think.

2713
03:03:06,980 --> 03:03:08,580
Locked and loaded.

2714
03:03:10,240 --> 03:03:11,080
Well, you know.

2715
03:03:30,830 --> 03:03:31,390
Sweet.

2716
03:03:31,850 --> 03:03:32,250
Sweet.

2717
03:03:36,220 --> 03:03:39,300
Ice, no, Ice Monkey protect him.

2718
03:03:39,620 --> 03:03:40,080
So true.

2719
03:03:41,280 --> 03:03:42,280
So true.

2720
03:03:44,700 --> 03:03:45,400
Wow!

2721
03:03:48,870 --> 03:03:50,290
Ooh, that was scary.

2722
03:03:50,790 --> 03:03:51,910
Oh, it's level 63.

2723
03:03:52,690 --> 03:03:53,670
I just realized.

2724
03:03:55,430 --> 03:03:57,130
You can all have some.

2725
03:03:57,630 --> 03:03:59,110
I hate him so much.

2726
03:04:01,210 --> 03:04:03,470
You can all have some.

2727
03:04:09,210 --> 03:04:09,670
Oh, wait.

2728
03:04:09,730 --> 03:04:10,890
Or is this round 63?

2729
03:04:11,470 --> 03:04:11,790
Oh.

2730
03:04:12,050 --> 03:04:13,150
I think we're in trouble.

2731
03:04:14,350 --> 03:04:15,950
I need to actually come up with a plan.

2732
03:04:17,090 --> 03:04:18,530
I'll take my $800.

2733
03:04:20,110 --> 03:04:22,010
And, um, let's see.

2734
03:04:22,810 --> 03:04:24,190
What do I want to add?

2735
03:04:24,570 --> 03:04:25,470
What do I want to add?

2736
03:04:25,630 --> 03:04:26,470
What do I want to add?

2737
03:04:27,330 --> 03:04:27,770
Oh!

2738
03:04:27,970 --> 03:04:30,050
Oh, you need to be better.

2739
03:04:31,430 --> 03:04:32,170
There we go.

2740
03:04:35,470 --> 03:04:36,230
Let's see.

2741
03:04:40,940 --> 03:04:41,620
Actually, no.

2742
03:04:41,700 --> 03:04:42,380
You're first.

2743
03:04:43,240 --> 03:04:44,020
You're strongest.

2744
03:04:45,680 --> 03:04:47,180
You're locked and loaded.

2745
03:04:47,320 --> 03:04:47,720
What next?

2746
03:04:48,600 --> 03:04:51,100
Engineer Monkey is doing his best.

2747
03:04:52,640 --> 03:04:53,120
Wizard Monkey.

2748
03:04:55,420 --> 03:04:55,840
Yeah.

2749
03:04:58,460 --> 03:05:00,600
Five walls of fire in the first loop.

2750
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:01,960
Like these guys?

2751
03:05:03,460 --> 03:05:06,080
Five Wizard Monkeys going ham.

2752
03:05:08,300 --> 03:05:09,420
This is a Wizard Monkey.

2753
03:05:10,120 --> 03:05:10,580
Wizard Monkey.

2754
03:05:11,060 --> 03:05:11,700
Wizard Monkey.

03:05:14,760 --> 03:05:15,420
Three.

2758
03:05:16,100 --> 03:05:16,640
Let's go.

2759
03:05:18,140 --> 03:05:18,160
Four.

2760
03:05:20,480 --> 03:05:21,140
Five.

2761
03:05:24,380 --> 03:05:24,880
Yeah!

2762
03:05:29,360 --> 03:05:30,400
Look at them.

2763
03:05:30,680 --> 03:05:31,240
Oh, no!

2764
03:05:31,420 --> 03:05:32,540
I can't afford it!

2765
03:05:33,260 --> 03:05:33,400
Uh-oh.

2766
03:05:33,460 --> 03:05:34,100
Incoming!

2767
03:05:36,380 --> 03:05:37,920
Well, I think we'll make it.

2768
03:05:39,700 --> 03:05:41,080
I think we'll be fine.

2769
03:05:55,080 --> 03:05:56,000
Ooh, they're getting faster.

2770
03:05:58,000 --> 03:05:58,660
Whoa!

2771
03:06:01,740 --> 03:06:03,060
More fire!

2772
03:06:07,970 --> 03:06:09,780
Nothing is even making it over there.

2773
03:06:12,050 --> 03:06:14,070
Nothing's even making it over there.

2774
03:06:16,410 --> 03:06:17,890
That was fun.

2775
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:24,720

This is a little guy.

03:09:19,660 --> 03:09:21,920
You can sell it for zero dollars.

2815
03:09:22,540 --> 03:09:24,220
This century is getting in my way.

2816
03:09:24,700 --> 03:09:27,960
Oh, this is not going to hit anything.

2817

Incoming shot.

2827
03:09:58,350 --> 03:10:00,810
Come on, make it to the wall of fire.

2828
03:10:01,030 --> 03:10:02,630

Thank you.

2835
03:10:12,950 --> 03:10:14,030
Am I your mom?

2836
03:10:18,590 --> 03:10:20,690
What are you doing over there?

2837
03:10:20,950 --> 03:10:21,350
Oh my god.

2838
03:10:21,650 --> 03:10:22,070
He's looking.

2839
03:10:22,750 --> 03:10:24,970
You guys, I think it's an inside job.

2840
03:10:25,510 --> 03:10:27,350
I think he's trying to take Ice Monkey out.

2841
03:10:28,970 --> 03:10:31,030
I think he was trying to take Ice Monkey out.

2842
03:10:31,890 --> 03:10:32,550
Oh my god.

2843
03:10:34,370 --> 03:10:35,490

2844
03:10:35,770 --> 03:10:36,990
It sucks so bad.

The Phoenix, right?

2848
03:10:51,120 --> 03:10:53,880
Powerful Phoenix wreaks balloon havoc for 20 seconds.

2849
03:11:07,280 --> 03:11:09,200
Let's look at the 14,000.

He's good.

2862
03:12:42,240 --> 03:12:44,080
He's killed a thousand balloons.

2863
03:12:45,500 --> 03:12:47,380
Look at this guy producing everything.

2864
03:12:53,670 --> 03:12:54,230

2865
03:12:55,230 --> 03:12:55,730
Oh!

2866
03:12:56,850 --> 03:12:58,470
They were camel.

2867
03:12:58,570 --> 03:12:59,670
They didn't die in here.

2868
03:13:00,730 --> 03:13:01,010
Hmm.

2869
03:13:01,710 --> 03:13:03,870
If I put a village here,

2870
03:13:08,870 --> 03:13:18,990
here if I extend the range how far is the range on this one
I don't think it'll reach but it might be good just for

2871
03:13:18,990 --> 03:13:22,070
everybody here give

2872
03:13:28,330 --> 03:13:33,010

2874
03:13:53,380 --> 03:14:05,940
like a little bit of these guys too because this one they'll
overlap you know they'll overlap and range but a village can

2875
03:14:05,940 --> 03:14:07,460
increase other radius

2876
03:14:10,660 --> 03:14:32,140

03:15:25,320 --> 03:15:28,260
So I can like work on other stuff.

2886
03:15:28,360 --> 03:15:28,900

2910
03:16:51,310 --> 03:16:55,110

First strike capability.

Ice monkey carry, ice monkey carry.

03:17:05,600 --> 03:17:09,600
Now here, do you think I should have another boat or should
I get another submarine?

03:17:11,820 --> 03:17:12,800
What do you think?

2915
03:17:14,140 --> 03:17:16,340
Because I think I can just fill this up.

2916
03:17:16,500 --> 03:17:19,760
I mean, there's only two water units, so...

2917

Siege!

2922
03:17:33,020 --> 03:17:34,040
I can't!

2923
03:17:34,540 --> 03:17:36,120
Just upgrade, they said.

2924
03:17:36,740 --> 03:17:38,340
When I can't, I even upgrade.

2925
03:17:39,660 --> 03:17:41,000
Waiting for 12,000.

2926
03:17:42,740 --> 03:17:43,260

2927
03:17:43,260 --> 03:17:44,660
Submarine?

2928
03:17:44,840 --> 03:17:46,100
Submarines are cooler.

2929
03:17:47,100 --> 03:17:48,180
Submarines are cooler.

2930
03:17:50,260 --> 03:17:52,140
A Gatling straight down the path.

2931
03:17:52,240 --> 03:17:53,000
Like this!

2932
03:17:53,800 --> 03:17:55,200
Then we can get one here too.

2933
03:17:56,400 --> 03:17:57,160
That'd be so awesome.

2934
03:17:57,400 --> 03:17:58,100
You're so right.

2935
03:17:58,360 --> 03:17:59,700

2950
03:18:23,620 --> 03:18:24,120
Oh.

2951
03:18:31,470 --> 03:18:31,950

03:18:35,150 --> 03:18:38,550
It's pretty nice looking, watching all like the...

2954
03:18:38,550 --> 03:18:39,250

Aren't you scared?

Pop!

2959
03:18:55,050 --> 03:18:58,350
And then they'll also get the camel, so it'll be good.

2960
03:18:59,270 --> 03:19:01,930
Collecting that so we can buy this for each of them.

2963
03:19:33,590 --> 03:19:35,320
Aw, it's too far away from anything.

2964
03:19:36,590 --> 03:19:37,050
No!

2965
03:19:38,150 --> 03:19:38,270
Oh.

2966
03:19:39,170 --> 03:19:39,830

2967
03:19:40,830 --> 03:19:40,950
Oh!

2968
03:19:46,630 --> 03:19:49,770
Yo, that placement is insane.

2969
03:19:50,650 --> 03:19:52,990
That placement is insane!

2970
03:19:56,430 --> 03:19:58,050
Holy cow!

2971
03:19:58,890 --> 03:20:00,670
So we'll go pursue.

2972
03:20:00,830 --> 03:20:01,630
We'll do two...

2973
03:20:01,930 --> 03:20:02,910
Okay.

2974
03:20:09,920 --> 03:20:12,120
That's like pixel perfect placement I feel.

2975
03:20:13,660 --> 03:20:13,960
Incoming!

2976
03:20:14,080 --> 03:20:14,780

03:20:15,080 --> 03:20:15,800
Incoming!

2978
03:20:27,410 --> 03:20:29,470

03:20:31,070 --> 03:20:32,590
Holy will me!

2980
03:20:33,610 --> 03:20:35,030

I'm still scared of the DDTs though you guys, I'm scared,
I'm scared.

2988
03:20:55,830 --> 03:20:57,110
I'm scared, I'm scared!

2989
03:21:00,210 --> 03:21:02,570
When you returned streaming, you mentioned you're still
figuring things out.

2990
03:21:03,070 --> 03:21:04,550
A professor I once...

2991
03:21:04,550 --> 03:21:08,570
I had once told me I'm still figuring out what I want to be
when I grow up.

2992
03:21:08,890 --> 03:21:10,370
Sounds silly, but I hope it helps.

2993
03:21:10,870 --> 03:21:12,170
Aww, thank you!

2994
03:21:12,610 --> 03:21:14,310
I think I mean...

2995
03:21:14,650 --> 03:21:20,010
I think a lot of people are, you know, thinking of what they
want to do.

2996
03:21:20,170 --> 03:21:21,230
See OMG incoming!

2997
03:21:22,370 --> 03:21:24,850
And it's okay to always be thinking about stuff.

2998
03:21:26,730 --> 03:21:27,450
For sure.

2999
03:21:29,430 --> 03:21:30,870
But I appreciate your...

3000
03:21:31,650 --> 03:21:33,150
You're wanting to help.

03:21:36,030 --> 03:21:37,450
Furry, welcome to membership.

03:21:37,670 --> 03:21:38,130
Thank you!

3003
03:21:41,150 --> 03:21:43,990
When I upgrade this, does it add anything else or...

3004
03:21:43,990 --> 03:21:44,630
Oh, just...

3005
03:21:44,630 --> 03:21:55,750

already at back at 7,000 nice we can probably get the

3006
03:21:55,750 --> 03:22:06,510
necromancer at this rate it's always good to be open to the
possibility of change too yeah I mean is that all you got

3007
03:22:08,870 --> 03:22:17,850
there's been a lot of stuff on my mind recently and But I
think I...

3008
03:22:17,850 --> 03:22:18,490
Well, I'm not think.

3009
03:22:18,630 --> 03:22:20,190
I know I'm an overthinker.

3010
03:22:22,950 --> 03:22:28,630
So, some decisions that come easy to some people aren't so
easy for me when I'm just like...

3011
03:22:30,750 --> 03:22:31,510
Drowning pool!

3012
03:22:32,190 --> 03:22:33,010

I wonder if I should put some guys right here.

3016
03:22:38,730 --> 03:22:39,710
Just because we can, right?

3017
03:22:39,970 --> 03:22:42,690
Maybe I should have a whole team of snipers just...

3018
03:22:44,630 --> 03:22:46,710
We can have another alchemist, right?

3019
03:22:48,070 --> 03:22:48,510
Let's do it.

3020
03:22:48,590 --> 03:22:50,290
Let's throw another alchemist on these guys.

3021
03:22:51,310 --> 03:22:51,770
Right here.

3022
03:22:57,060 --> 03:22:58,240
And then he can buff.

3023
03:22:59,340 --> 03:23:00,340
Buff, buff, buff, buff.

3024
03:23:01,560 --> 03:23:04,360
Buff, buff, buff.

3025
03:23:07,500 --> 03:23:08,080
Incoming.

3026
03:23:08,220 --> 03:23:08,960
Is that all you got?

3027
03:23:10,440 --> 03:23:11,960
Round 89, baby!

3028
03:23:13,240 --> 03:23:14,340
BFB incoming.

3029
03:23:20,470 --> 03:23:21,570
Holy cow.

3030
03:23:24,900 --> 03:23:26,320
Wall of fire!

3031
03:23:26,560 --> 03:23:27,760
Wall of fire!

3032
03:23:27,940 --> 03:23:29,040
Ring of fire!

3033
03:23:30,260 --> 03:23:31,540
Louie, welcome to membership.

3034
03:23:31,860 --> 03:23:33,000
Thank you so much!

3035
03:23:33,640 --> 03:23:35,760
Glue boy, it might be time for some glue, right?

3036
03:23:36,040 --> 03:23:38,240
Well, I don't know if time is the right.

3037
03:23:39,040 --> 03:23:41,700
Do glues, do glue guys work?

3038
03:23:41,820 --> 03:23:42,780
Do they work?

3039
03:23:42,920 --> 03:23:44,160
Do they work on DDTs?

3040
03:23:47,040 --> 03:23:48,740
Do the glues work on the DDT?

3041
03:23:51,760 --> 03:23:52,660
I question.

3042
03:23:55,660 --> 03:23:56,140
Yes?

3043
03:23:56,900 --> 03:23:58,700
Okay, we'll put a guy in here.

3044
03:23:59,660 --> 03:24:00,660
We'll put him right here.

3045
03:24:03,060 --> 03:24:04,480
So, we've written them to Lizaboo.

3046
03:24:05,080 --> 03:24:05,540
Glue, glue.

3047
03:24:06,120 --> 03:24:07,220
Oh, I need more money.

3048
03:24:08,060 --> 03:24:08,600
Thank you.

3049
03:24:09,700 --> 03:24:10,180
Glue!

3050
03:24:13,000 --> 03:24:14,860
Okay, DDT, do your worst.

3051
03:24:15,840 --> 03:24:16,860
DDT, incoming!

3052
03:24:20,420 --> 03:24:22,680
Only if they can spot Camo.

3053
03:24:23,500 --> 03:24:23,980
What do you mean?

3054
03:24:26,760 --> 03:24:30,140
Oh, okay, okay.

3055
03:24:30,520 --> 03:24:33,220
So we need them to be able to see Camel then.

3056
03:24:34,000 --> 03:24:35,340
DDTs count as Camel?

3057
03:24:36,520 --> 03:24:37,840
Shut up, Quincy.

3058
03:24:39,840 --> 03:24:41,240
Shut up.

3059
03:24:47,620 --> 03:24:50,720
I need an actual answer to that.

3060
03:24:51,180 --> 03:24:52,320
DDTs are Camel and Lead.

3061
03:24:58,820 --> 03:25:00,760
I said it's strongest.

3062
03:25:00,780 --> 03:25:02,000
Thank you for the reminder.

3063
03:25:03,260 --> 03:25:04,000
Thank you for the reminder.

3064
03:25:05,020 --> 03:25:07,540
Maybe then we put a little village here.

3065
03:25:19,800 --> 03:25:22,840
It's not much, but it could help in a pinch.

3066
03:25:32,580 --> 03:25:33,060
Headshot.

3067
03:25:33,460 --> 03:25:34,520
Thank you for this every time.

3068
03:25:34,560 --> 03:25:35,360
I'll read it in just a second.

3069
03:25:35,760 --> 03:25:36,060
Sorry.

3070
03:25:36,360 --> 03:25:36,840
Hold on.

3071
03:25:36,940 --> 03:25:37,560
I'm blooms in.

3072
03:25:39,020 --> 03:25:39,500
Aplosion.

3073
03:25:43,500 --> 03:25:44,920
The one last pop.

3074
03:25:46,920 --> 03:25:47,400
Mmm.

3075
03:25:48,640 --> 03:25:49,860
Where'd it go?

3076
03:25:50,640 --> 03:25:52,460
My chat's all wonky.

3077
03:25:53,440 --> 03:25:55,020
There's so many carriers you can do.

3078
03:25:55,980 --> 03:25:58,660
And you know that you can always switch to something else in
the future.

3079
03:25:58,780 --> 03:26:00,520
But that doesn't help decide what to do first.

3080
03:26:01,480 --> 03:26:02,260
I don't know.

3081
03:26:03,980 --> 03:26:04,940
I don't know.

3082
03:26:07,500 --> 03:26:07,980
It's...

3083
03:26:07,980 --> 03:26:10,440
I mean, it's a little complicated.

3084
03:26:10,800 --> 03:26:11,160
But, you know.

3085
03:26:14,160 --> 03:26:14,980
It's fine.

3086
03:26:16,600 --> 03:26:17,300
It's all good.

3087
03:26:17,660 --> 03:26:22,540
I just take it one afterlife day at a time.

3088
03:26:25,960 --> 03:26:27,200
Thank you.

3089
03:26:27,200 --> 03:26:28,300
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3090
03:26:35,190 --> 03:26:36,530
Quincy's got your back, apparently.

3091
03:26:37,630 --> 03:26:37,870
Yes?

3092
03:26:38,170 --> 03:26:38,510
Yes?

3093
03:26:38,790 --> 03:26:39,550
You do?

3094
03:26:40,010 --> 03:26:41,050
You're on my back!

3095
03:26:45,530 --> 03:26:46,460
I think...

3096
03:26:46,770 --> 03:26:47,690
We'll soak.

3097
03:26:52,110 --> 03:26:52,730
Yeah.

3098
03:26:53,170 --> 03:26:53,670
We'll soak.

3099
03:26:53,890 --> 03:26:54,150
We'll soak.

3100
03:26:54,330 --> 03:26:55,510
It'll be a little more offensive.

3101
03:26:55,910 --> 03:26:58,350
It'll be a little bit more offensive.

3102
03:26:59,330 --> 03:27:01,370
You can all have some.

3103
03:27:01,690 --> 03:27:02,550
Come on.

3104
03:27:02,650 --> 03:27:03,310
Come on.

3105
03:27:03,350 --> 03:27:04,550
See OMG incoming.

3106
03:27:05,310 --> 03:27:05,710
Oh my god.

3107
03:27:05,890 --> 03:27:06,890
He sounds so like...

3108
03:27:06,890 --> 03:27:08,370
See OMG incoming!

3109
03:27:09,670 --> 03:27:10,730
He sounds so like...

3110
03:27:12,090 --> 03:27:12,690
Wee!

3111
03:27:22,360 --> 03:27:23,560
92, baby.

3112
03:27:25,900 --> 03:27:27,180
Colin, welcome to membership.

3113
03:27:28,080 --> 03:27:29,180
More choppers.

3114
03:27:29,800 --> 03:27:30,540
I agree.

3115
03:27:31,940 --> 03:27:32,540
Oh!

3116
03:27:32,700 --> 03:27:33,720
I agree.

3117
03:27:34,040 --> 03:27:35,360
More choppers, more choppers.

3118
03:27:35,640 --> 03:27:37,120
And we can put them right here, too.

3119
03:27:41,040 --> 03:27:41,400
Uh-oh.

3120
03:27:43,800 --> 03:27:45,220
Is it enough?

3121
03:27:45,700 --> 03:27:46,900
It's enough, baby.

3122
03:27:47,140 --> 03:27:47,500
It's enough.

3123
03:27:49,340 --> 03:27:50,600
It's enough for now.

3124
03:27:50,760 --> 03:27:51,560
It's enough for now.

3125
03:27:51,620 --> 03:27:52,640
BFB is incoming.

3126
03:27:57,390 --> 03:27:58,260
Come on.

3127
03:27:58,980 --> 03:28:00,940
You can all have some.

3128
03:28:04,200 --> 03:28:17,220
let's go i usually i i do usually die at that one incoming
headshot headshot i think

3129
03:28:24,260 --> 03:28:29,860
i'll be able to get enough from this round

3130
03:28:33,630 --> 03:28:45,050
look they don't even make it past the wall of fire yo silver
guy welcome to membership the wild spider whoever idea was

3131
03:28:45,050 --> 03:28:56,530
the fire circle you you you you cooked with that and they're
not even like they're just there's three zero zero like zero

3132
03:28:56,530 --> 03:29:05,730
three zero it's nothing else I'm wondering would it be worth
like unlocking something else like the like will they do

3133
03:29:05,730 --> 03:29:09,010
other stuff as well as the wall of fire so

3134
03:29:15,950 --> 03:29:17,210
How close are we to Necromancer?

3135
03:29:17,410 --> 03:29:19,150
Actually, really not that far away.

3136
03:29:20,470 --> 03:29:21,450
Really not that far away.

3137
03:29:26,350 --> 03:29:27,190
Zero, zero, zero.

3138
03:29:27,370 --> 03:29:29,130
Ice Monkey giving so much luck.

3139
03:29:33,880 --> 03:29:35,820
I mean, I mean like buying...

3140
03:29:35,820 --> 03:29:37,760
Oh, I only have Intense Magic, actually.

3141
03:29:39,220 --> 03:29:41,160
Should I upgrade the Intense Magic?

3142
03:29:41,260 --> 03:29:42,180
Do you think it will do...

3143
03:29:42,180 --> 03:29:43,560
What's the one after that?

3144
03:29:44,160 --> 03:29:45,320
Oh, the Camel Bloons.

3145
03:29:46,740 --> 03:29:48,740
Which I don't entirely need.

3146
03:29:51,420 --> 03:29:51,860
but...

3147
03:29:52,400 --> 03:29:54,380
No, I am still aiming for the Necro.

3148
03:29:54,500 --> 03:29:56,280
That's why I'm not going to buy any other upgrades.

3149
03:29:56,520 --> 03:29:59,620
But, I mean, like, buying the Intense Magic, would it be
worth it?

3150
03:30:00,500 --> 03:30:02,860
Or is it not going to change anything, I wonder?

3151
03:30:04,080 --> 03:30:04,800
Save the money?

3152
03:30:05,420 --> 03:30:05,820
Oh, okay.

3153
03:30:06,020 --> 03:30:06,500
You know what?

3154
03:30:06,520 --> 03:30:07,380
That's fair, too.

3155
03:30:10,280 --> 03:30:10,720
Because...

3156
03:30:10,720 --> 03:30:11,900
How much is it?

3157
03:30:13,440 --> 03:30:14,860
Oh, it's so cheap!

3158
03:30:15,360 --> 03:30:16,760
It's so cheap, actually.

3159
03:30:17,320 --> 03:30:17,760
Wow.

3160
03:30:18,760 --> 03:30:21,200
Wait, is it actually that...

3161
03:30:21,200 --> 03:30:22,480
Why is it so cheap?

3162
03:30:26,940 --> 03:30:28,040
Oh, water base!

3163
03:30:28,140 --> 03:30:29,280
That's right, I was gonna get the sub.

3164
03:30:31,020 --> 03:30:32,560
Can I get sub end bolt?

3165
03:30:33,560 --> 03:30:34,360
I don't think so.

3166
03:30:34,840 --> 03:30:36,180
I think it's one or the other, man.

3167
03:30:37,600 --> 03:30:37,960
Yeah.

3168
03:30:38,540 --> 03:30:40,720
Only three guys can fit here.

3169
03:30:41,320 --> 03:30:41,940
That's okay.

3170
03:30:42,240 --> 03:30:43,740
Um, what would I give you?

3171
03:30:49,730 --> 03:30:51,890
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

3172
03:30:52,890 --> 03:30:53,390
Ugh!

3173
03:30:56,470 --> 03:30:57,110
Oopsie.

3174
03:30:58,210 --> 03:30:59,770
I didn't mean to do that.

3175
03:31:18,100 --> 03:31:19,840
Since I can't add another guy anyway.

3176
03:31:22,800 --> 03:31:24,160
There we go.

3177
03:31:35,160 --> 03:31:36,160
Is that all you got?

3178
03:31:36,600 --> 03:31:36,920
Oh!

3179
03:31:37,700 --> 03:31:38,960
You can all have it!

3180
03:31:39,120 --> 03:31:39,880
Come on!

3181
03:31:44,880 --> 03:31:46,160
Holy cow!

3182
03:31:51,640 --> 03:31:52,280
Awesome!

3183
03:31:52,980 --> 03:31:54,540
Because I'm a knowledgeable monkey.

3184
03:31:59,240 --> 03:31:59,800
Sheesh!

3185
03:32:00,120 --> 03:32:02,780
The wall of fire is so OP!

3186
03:32:04,680 --> 03:32:05,260
Holy cow!

3187
03:32:05,420 --> 03:32:06,440
And also the druid!

3188
03:32:06,600 --> 03:32:08,100
I'm like, should I upgrade him too?

3189
03:32:08,840 --> 03:32:09,820
How close are you?

3190
03:32:14,820 --> 03:32:17,560
Maybe I should also do like the hard thorns?

3191
03:32:19,300 --> 03:32:19,620
Hmm.

3192
03:32:21,640 --> 03:32:23,000
What's the one after that?

3193
03:32:23,100 --> 03:32:23,700
Oh, the thunder.

3194
03:32:28,100 --> 03:32:28,780
Yeah.

3195
03:32:31,100 --> 03:32:33,160
Well, it just doesn't hurt to buy it, right?

3196
03:32:37,480 --> 03:32:38,160
Headshot.

3197
03:32:48,020 --> 03:32:49,220

You know what?

3209
03:33:44,890 --> 03:33:49,050

3224
03:34:55,200 --> 03:34:56,700
I was like, what are these?

3225
03:35:01,390 --> 03:35:03,390

3226
03:35:06,410 --> 03:35:06,890

I am the best.

3229
03:35:20,700 --> 03:35:23,840
Why were all the attacking balloons going up?

3230
03:35:24,860 --> 03:35:28,880
I guess they count for like some back-end support.

3231
03:35:32,300 --> 03:35:34,720
Oh, you can change where he summons.

3232
03:35:34,900 --> 03:35:35,500
Oh, awesome.

3233
03:35:35,820 --> 03:35:36,280
Okay, let's see.

3234
03:35:42,140 --> 03:35:43,080
Click to set target.

3235
03:35:43,220 --> 03:35:44,260

3236
03:35:45,640 --> 03:35:46,480
And like this?

3237
03:35:47,360 --> 03:35:48,160
I don't know, actually.

3238
03:35:48,300 --> 03:35:48,800
What does this do?

3239
03:35:53,970 --> 03:35:58,170
Oh, is it like targets Camo and doesn't target Camo?

3240
03:36:02,720 --> 03:36:05,280
But is it Camo or non-Camo?

3241
03:36:05,420 --> 03:36:07,220
Like, you can't do both of them at the same time?

3242
03:36:09,860 --> 03:36:10,620
Quincy's now at max.

3243
03:36:10,700 --> 03:36:11,220
You want some?

3244
03:36:11,420 --> 03:36:12,780
He's maxed on level!

3245
03:36:17,020 --> 03:36:17,980
Let's go.

3246
03:36:19,400 --> 03:36:20,960
Just priority, just priority.

3247
03:36:26,110 --> 03:36:28,130
But we'll still attack the other ones, right?

3248
03:36:28,350 --> 03:36:29,190
So it's not so bad.

3249
03:36:30,610 --> 03:36:31,330
How are you doing?

3250
03:36:32,450 --> 03:36:34,770
We're pretty far from that one, but that's okay.

3251
03:36:34,970 --> 03:36:36,430
Okay, what can I get?

3252
03:36:36,550 --> 03:36:38,690
Because they got through pretty easily.

3253
03:36:40,290 --> 03:36:41,910
They got around to here.

3254
03:36:41,990 --> 03:36:47,930
so I'm nervous I'm nervous I mean there's so much we can add
we have all we have so much space

3255
03:36:56,980 --> 03:37:15,770
um bigger stacks for the oh for this this one oh and hot
stacks there we go trying to decide what I want we'll take

3256
03:37:15,770 --> 03:37:21,530
our money too Upgrade what I upgrade what I have now.

3257
03:37:21,710 --> 03:37:27,710
I don't have anything that can like go see like everything
is Everything and I'm waiting.

3258
03:37:27,890 --> 03:37:32,230
I can't really upgrade anything that I have right now
Unfortunately

3259
03:37:36,830 --> 03:37:45,930
I'm trying to get more of the top path for that guy another
helicopter It's good.

3260
03:37:46,170 --> 03:37:49,610
It's good Maybe another ice monkey.

3261
03:37:50,710 --> 03:37:51,770
Oh, I wonder what is it?

3262
03:37:52,390 --> 03:37:52,910
Yo!

3263
03:37:54,230 --> 03:37:55,830
We're doing nothing!

3264
03:37:57,470 --> 03:37:59,370
Guy is absolutely cracked.

3265
03:38:02,410 --> 03:38:03,450
Absolutely cracked.

3266
03:38:09,960 --> 03:38:13,280
Zero, zero, zero, ice monkeys in the middle.

3267
03:38:16,400 --> 03:38:18,240
Glue monkey for the wall of fire.

3268
03:38:18,540 --> 03:38:20,980
Oh, so like have them like kind of stuck in here?

3269
03:38:21,160 --> 03:38:21,700
That's a good idea.

3270
03:38:21,960 --> 03:38:22,440
I like that.

3271
03:38:32,300 --> 03:38:33,900
We'll even do the same one.

3272
03:38:37,420 --> 03:38:38,020
And,

3273
03:38:41,300 --> 03:38:41,900
uh...

3274
03:38:41,900 --> 03:38:42,460
Oh, wait.

3275
03:38:42,540 --> 03:38:43,340
What do you have fit here?

3276
03:38:44,220 --> 03:38:44,680
No.

3277
03:38:45,880 --> 03:38:47,360
Oh, but he could fit here.

3278
03:38:47,880 --> 03:38:48,420
Oh, shoot.

3279
03:38:49,960 --> 03:38:51,360
I don't think he's getting...

3280
03:38:51,360 --> 03:38:52,500
Oh, oh.

3281
03:38:53,340 --> 03:38:54,560
Maybe I messed up.

3282
03:38:56,560 --> 03:38:57,080
Hmm.

3283
03:39:06,870 --> 03:39:07,790
You know what?

3284
03:39:07,790 --> 03:39:09,110
I'm sticking with it.

3285
03:39:13,060 --> 03:39:14,440
Get bigger globs.

3286
03:39:16,760 --> 03:39:17,580
I did

3287
03:39:21,220 --> 03:39:27,800
Run ruined Okay, let's get another helicopter Do I have a
mid helicopter?

3288
03:39:28,560 --> 03:39:42,320
No I do not In fact, I'm going to put this one Here I think
you can fit a monkey next to it What, like this one?

3289
03:39:42,480 --> 03:39:47,880
The down draft one I guess I could unlock it

3290
03:39:53,280 --> 03:40:02,860
other glue needs bigger gloves too no that's when i already
did this one is corrosive though the path is support which

3291
03:40:02,860 --> 03:40:12,060
is not bad support is good because you know more we can push
back the more time we can save to to blow them up you know

3292
03:40:12,060 --> 03:40:29,340
so maybe two two five zero maybe I can't afford the apache
It's great versus ceramics I think I want to try it, you

3293
03:40:29,340 --> 03:40:50,120

3294
03:40:50,120 --> 03:40:54,060
reason, because everything is like, la la la, easy peasy.

3295
03:40:54,760 --> 03:40:56,620

That's it?

3333
03:42:32,390 --> 03:42:33,370
I felt like that was nothing.

3334
03:42:36,270 --> 03:42:38,110
I felt like that was nothing.

3335
03:42:40,810 --> 03:42:42,150
No, I can't get my gatlin.

3336
03:42:42,270 --> 03:42:43,370

I'm hearing someone talking on the right.

3345
03:43:14,520 --> 03:43:18,040
I don't know who is talking in my ear.

3346
03:43:20,320 --> 03:43:21,320

03:44:40,660 --> 03:44:42,420
The fire has breached.

3376
03:44:43,960 --> 03:44:45,040
That was awfully close.

3377
03:44:45,100 --> 03:44:46,820
It actually was pretty close, wasn't it?

3378
03:44:48,440 --> 03:44:49,580
That was pretty close.

3379
03:44:50,300 --> 03:44:50,920
Yeah.

3380
03:44:51,920 --> 03:44:59,000
But we've reached round 103, in fact, so I am quite
satisfied with that.

3381
03:44:59,680 --> 03:45:00,220
Give me one second.

3382
03:45:00,360 --> 03:45:04,100
I am going to take us over to our brand new, if you guys
haven't seen it yet.

3383
03:45:04,980 --> 03:45:06,400
If you haven't seen it yet.

3384
03:45:07,300 --> 03:45:07,440
Ta-da!

3385
03:45:09,620 --> 03:45:13,120
And I'm also going to turn off the music because I want to
listen to my own music.

3386
03:45:14,520 --> 03:45:14,700
Um...

3387
03:45:21,500 --> 03:45:22,960
What do I want to listen to?

3388
03:45:28,640 --> 03:45:29,680
This one.

3389
03:45:30,040 --> 03:45:30,040
If

3390
03:45:33,710 --> 03:45:47,470
you haven't seen it yet.

3391
03:45:49,250 --> 03:45:50,290
We moved!

3392
03:45:51,170 --> 03:45:52,010
New Made Cafe!

3393
03:45:52,910 --> 03:46:01,030
Yeah, I showed it earlier on in the stream, so if you want
like a detailed tour, you can check out then...

3394
03:46:02,890 --> 03:46:04,470
Fuck you MVP star creator.

3395
03:46:04,590 --> 03:46:05,590
Thank you for the Akasupa.

3396
03:46:06,110 --> 03:46:06,790
Thank you.

3397
03:46:07,330 --> 03:46:08,370
Thank you so much.

3398
03:46:09,570 --> 03:46:11,810
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

3399
03:46:12,890 --> 03:46:13,170
Hmm.

3400
03:46:14,870 --> 03:46:15,950
So cute, right?

3401
03:46:16,750 --> 03:46:17,850
So cute, right?

3402
03:46:19,370 --> 03:46:19,810
Yeah.

3403
03:46:20,490 --> 03:46:24,350
So, uh, it's all, all, all revamped.

3404
03:46:25,510 --> 03:46:25,950
Fancy.

3405
03:46:27,190 --> 03:46:28,070
For main day.

3406
03:46:29,310 --> 03:46:35,890
Well, not entirely for main day, but it just happened to,
um, to kind of work out that way.

3407
03:46:40,330 --> 03:46:42,570
I forgot it's 310, happy main day.

3408
03:46:42,890 --> 03:46:43,310
Thank you!

3409
03:46:43,690 --> 03:46:45,850
Happy main day!

3410
03:46:47,290 --> 03:46:49,250
Happy main day, happy main day.

3411
03:46:52,290 --> 03:46:52,770
What?

3412
03:47:01,710 --> 03:47:05,650
If you're interested in a new theme, there's an Adventure
Time bloons on Steam.

3413
03:47:05,910 --> 03:47:06,390
Really?

3414
03:47:06,690 --> 03:47:07,970
Adventure Time themed!

3415
03:47:08,470 --> 03:47:09,770
Wait, that sounds so awesome.

3416
03:47:12,370 --> 03:47:14,570
Ah, cute minto.

3417
03:47:15,850 --> 03:47:16,650
Peepo, peepo.

3418
03:47:19,430 --> 03:47:21,030
Taimaz, welcome back for one month.

3419
03:47:21,230 --> 03:47:21,930
Thank you so much.

3420
03:47:23,490 --> 03:47:26,330
Finally, we, I know people have been asking, when is wet 3?

3421
03:47:27,910 --> 03:47:28,310
Patience.

3422
03:47:29,650 --> 03:47:31,490
Whenever wet 3 happens, it happens.

3423
03:47:32,510 --> 03:47:37,110
And if you don't know what I'm talking about, you can check
out some of the videos on my channel.

3424
03:47:37,370 --> 03:47:38,990
I did wet, and then wet 2.

3425
03:47:39,410 --> 03:47:40,670
And then one day will be wet 3.

3426
03:47:42,210 --> 03:47:44,690
Thanks for the stream, Ice Monkey Maidman.

3427
03:47:45,890 --> 03:47:46,350
Thank you guys.

3428
03:47:46,630 --> 03:47:48,790
Again, I'm so sorry for the change in the schedule.

3429
03:47:49,810 --> 03:47:57,790
But thank you for letting me indulge in my monkey
shenanigans.

3430
03:47:58,490 --> 03:48:01,650
So I appreciate it very much.

3431
03:48:01,870 --> 03:48:02,770
Thank you so much.

3432
03:48:03,610 --> 03:48:04,590
It was a lot of fun too.

3433
03:48:08,840 --> 03:48:09,320
Yeah.

3434
03:48:11,020 --> 03:48:11,500
Wait.

3435
03:48:11,640 --> 03:48:11,960
Oh my gosh.

3436
03:48:12,020 --> 03:48:12,740
My chat is frozen.

3437
03:48:12,820 --> 03:48:14,360
Hold on, was that on Akashupa again?

3438
03:48:15,320 --> 03:48:17,960
Happy May Day to our favorite ghostly maid, Valentine!

3439
03:48:18,580 --> 03:48:19,480
Thank you!

3440
03:48:20,780 --> 03:48:22,100
Happy May Day!

3441
03:48:22,800 --> 03:48:24,180
Aw, you guys are so nice.

3442
03:48:24,440 --> 03:48:25,920
Thanks for wishing me a happy May Day.

3443
03:48:26,020 --> 03:48:27,060
And a happy May Day to you too.

3444
03:48:27,400 --> 03:48:33,580
I hope your timelines have been blessed with many wonderful
maid art and fan art.

3445
03:48:34,200 --> 03:48:37,680
So, lovely maids that always blesses the timeline.

3446
03:48:40,680 --> 03:48:42,800
On days like these, Twitter feels a little less.

3447
03:48:42,820 --> 03:48:57,160
cursed right when it's like my favorite is um is uh in
november because when you do 11 like as the date it kind of

3451
03:49:33,850 --> 03:49:35,870

3452
03:49:39,450 --> 03:49:41,870
So I demand more balloons in the future.

3453
03:49:42,410 --> 03:49:42,910
Thanks, Nibbi.

3454
03:49:43,690 --> 03:49:44,930
I hope you're having fun.

3455
03:49:47,210 --> 03:49:48,650
That explains a lot.

3456
03:49:49,070 --> 03:49:49,970
Yeah, good tummy day?

3457
03:49:50,070 --> 03:49:50,410
Yeah, yeah.

3458
03:49:50,530 --> 03:49:51,890
Good tummy day is another one.

3459
03:49:56,910 --> 03:49:58,750
Good day thing, beloved.

3460
03:50:02,590 --> 03:50:04,710
It's because of the solar storm.

3461
03:50:05,730 --> 03:50:07,150
I saw them in New York tonight.

3462
03:50:07,990 --> 03:50:08,470
What?

3463
03:50:09,450 --> 03:50:10,570
Solar storm?

3464
03:50:11,930 --> 03:50:12,790
I had no idea.

3465
03:50:13,230 --> 03:50:14,290
I don't catch up with the news.

3466
03:50:16,210 --> 03:50:16,730
I don't...

3467
03:50:16,730 --> 03:50:19,750
I don't keep track of anything.

3468
03:50:20,110 --> 03:50:20,530
Oh gosh.

3469
03:50:21,070 --> 03:50:21,070
Wait.

3470
03:50:21,610 --> 03:50:23,490
Maybe I could have seen the northern lights.

3471
03:50:23,650 --> 03:50:24,250
I don't know.

3472
03:50:29,450 --> 03:50:30,690
It's cloudy here.

3473
03:50:30,770 --> 03:50:31,190
Oh no.

3474
03:50:34,890 --> 03:50:37,490
I'm gonna go out when the clouds clear up and check.

3475
03:50:38,030 --> 03:50:38,070
Yeah!

3476
03:50:38,630 --> 03:50:40,570
Wait, do you guys have any pictures?

3477
03:50:41,750 --> 03:50:42,310
...

3478
03:50:44,870 --> 03:50:48,250
I want to see, I want to see the northern lights.

3479
03:50:49,970 --> 03:50:57,250
But honestly, I was like thinking of maybe doing a trip to
see the northern lights.

3480
03:50:59,250 --> 03:51:04,270
Because I want to be a little bit more world-travely.

3481
03:51:04,610 --> 03:51:05,510
I've never been to Europe.

3482
03:51:05,770 --> 03:51:07,870
So I was like, well, if I go to like, I don't know.

3483
03:51:10,270 --> 03:51:10,890
I don't know.

3484
03:51:15,990 --> 03:51:31,470
like i would want i don't know i have no idea i have to
think of how i can incorporate it into something you know um

3485
03:51:31,470 --> 03:51:40,050
like uh like maybe if i went and saw kiwawa and then
traveled to see the northern lights or something that could

3486
03:51:40,050 --> 03:51:40,290
work.

3487
03:51:40,550 --> 03:51:41,870
Or if Kiowa wants to come with me.

3488
03:51:44,470 --> 03:51:45,450
I don't know.

3489
03:51:48,470 --> 03:51:49,590
Can you see them in Alaska?

3490
03:51:51,530 --> 03:51:53,070
Maybe in parts of Alaska.

3491
03:51:53,890 --> 03:52:00,070
There was actually, I saw a video recently about a national
park in Alaska.

3492
03:52:00,590 --> 03:52:01,530
I bookmarked it.

3493
03:52:01,550 --> 03:52:06,310
Hold on, let me see what it's called for anyone else
interested because I was like, this sounds so awesome.

3494
03:52:10,150 --> 03:52:18,450
because it's you have to it's a bit more difficult of a
national park to get to because it's very mountainous hold

3495
03:52:18,450 --> 03:52:25,890
on i saved it though because i was like i really want to go
here um but because it's hard to get to it's like you know

3496
03:52:25,890 --> 03:52:34,570
it's pretty secluded you don't have a lot of people going
wait what what are some of these videos that i saved and

3497
03:52:34,570 --> 03:52:45,070
they were deleted wasn't that oh no maybe i should start
saving them to my phone instead of bookmarking them no way

3498
03:52:45,070 --> 03:52:54,770
was one of them it oh i just saved it not too long ago oh i
found it it's called the gates gates of the arctic national

3499
03:52:54,770 --> 03:53:05,770
park and it's america's northern most and second largest
national park but it's also the least visited of oh yeah ko

3500
03:53:05,770 --> 03:53:12,770
knew it Yeah, it's also the least visited of the national
parks.

3501
03:53:14,290 --> 03:53:17,410
But, like, the photos are just so insane.

3502
03:53:17,710 --> 03:53:20,170
And I was like, any reason to go to Alaska, baby?

3503
03:53:21,190 --> 03:53:22,050
Good guess, KO.

3504
03:53:22,210 --> 03:53:22,490
Yeah.

3505
03:53:26,110 --> 03:53:26,950
I've been there?

3506
03:53:27,050 --> 03:53:28,550
Oh, what did you think, Clockwork?

3507
03:53:28,650 --> 03:53:29,270
Did you like it?

3508
03:53:29,350 --> 03:53:30,210
How was it?

3509
03:53:33,430 --> 03:53:35,270
I want to see Glacier National Park, too.

3510
03:53:35,390 --> 03:53:35,750
Yeah.

3511
03:53:37,870 --> 03:53:38,490
Got it.

3512
03:53:38,730 --> 03:53:38,970
Thanks, man.

3513
03:53:39,090 --> 03:53:39,990
Yeah, of course.

3514
03:53:41,730 --> 03:53:42,170
Hmm.

3515
03:53:42,590 --> 03:53:44,090
The pics on Wiki look pretty cool.

3516
03:53:44,510 --> 03:53:44,510
Right!

3517
03:53:45,070 --> 03:53:45,870
Happy May Day!

3518
03:53:45,990 --> 03:53:47,710
I'm going on a European cruise this summer!

3519
03:53:48,050 --> 03:53:50,990
So I hope you can travel more as well.

3520
03:53:51,150 --> 03:53:51,650
Oh my gosh!

3521
03:53:51,750 --> 03:53:52,390
Where is it going?

3522
03:53:53,050 --> 03:53:53,730
That's so awesome.

3523
03:53:54,110 --> 03:53:54,970
Cold but very pretty.

3524
03:53:55,910 --> 03:53:57,630
I don't mind the cold so much anymore.

3525
03:53:58,270 --> 03:53:59,250
I went to Antarctica.

3526
03:54:00,630 --> 03:54:02,290
I experienced the cold.

3527
03:54:02,870 --> 03:54:04,110
I experienced the...

3528
03:54:04,110 --> 03:54:04,730
I don't know.

3529
03:54:05,230 --> 03:54:06,670
Is Antarctica the coldest place on Earth?

3530
03:54:09,190 --> 03:54:12,370
I experienced the southernmost place on earth.

3531
03:54:13,910 --> 03:54:15,630
I went to the ends of the earth.

3532
03:54:16,690 --> 03:54:17,870
Italy and Greece.

3533
03:54:18,310 --> 03:54:18,450
Woo!

3534
03:54:21,410 --> 03:54:22,530
So fun.

3535
03:54:24,070 --> 03:54:25,010
Mike Tyson!

3536
03:54:25,390 --> 03:54:25,990
Thanks for the gifting!

3537
03:54:27,330 --> 03:54:28,910
You went there in the summer though?

3538
03:54:29,030 --> 03:54:31,050
Yeah, because they wouldn't let me go in the winter.

3539
03:54:32,750 --> 03:54:35,930
Though, if there was like a way to do a...

3540
03:54:37,870 --> 03:54:47,270
I would have to, if there was a way to like, I don't wanna
call it an internship, but like, maybe it would be

3541
03:54:47,270 --> 03:54:50,070
considered an internship with the scientists that stay.

3542
03:54:50,790 --> 03:55:03,090
The side that I went on was the west part of Antarctica,
which is probably maybe the better side to go to right now,

3543
03:55:03,310 --> 03:55:12,710
because that's the side that's actively melting, but the
east side of Antarctica is actually growing so we might find

3544
03:55:12,710 --> 03:55:20,090
that Antarctica changes shape you know like in I mean it's
going to take hundreds of hundreds and hundreds of years um

3545
03:55:20,090 --> 03:55:26,330
if you guys become a ghost you might be able to see it but
it's kind of interesting

3546
03:55:30,190 --> 03:55:37,830
Shiraishi went to make content so Glacier growth, yippee,
yeah.

3547
03:55:39,150 --> 03:55:40,790
I applied to one of those internship thingies.

3548
03:55:40,990 --> 03:55:41,750
I don't think I got it.

3549
03:55:42,090 --> 03:55:42,450
No!

3550
03:55:44,150 --> 03:55:47,390
That one time my Oshi went to Alaska and saw the Northern
Lights anime play.

3551
03:55:49,710 --> 03:55:50,490
Thank you.

3552
03:55:50,970 --> 03:56:01,110
If I go, you can bet your butt that I will film everything
and then I can do a best as yet to come song cover of it and

3553
03:56:01,110 --> 03:56:11,750
I have to learn Gaelic will sing it and then I will have the
footage in the background just like at the end of MGS1 yeah

3554
03:56:11,750 --> 03:56:26,120
you can but your butt that's what would happen what melts
freezes elsewhere cool yeah because you know you whenever

3555
03:56:26,120 --> 03:56:34,220
you hear about Antarctica it's always like pretty grim
sounding news but when I learned that At least some part of

3556
03:56:34,220 --> 03:56:35,480
Antarctica was growing.

3557
03:56:35,780 --> 03:56:39,560
I don't know if it's growing at a rate to...

3558
03:56:41,560 --> 03:56:42,520
What's the word?

3559
03:56:43,980 --> 03:56:46,700
Like, offset the melting, you know?

3560
03:56:48,300 --> 03:56:48,860
But...

3561
03:56:48,860 --> 03:56:49,740
There is hope.

3562
03:56:50,760 --> 03:56:52,820
Ghosts don't belong in Alaska.

3563
03:56:54,980 --> 03:56:56,240
I was busy doing finals.

3564
03:56:56,400 --> 03:56:57,100
I forgot about the stream.

3565
03:56:57,220 --> 03:56:58,860
No, that's so much more important.

3566
03:56:59,180 --> 03:57:00,040
I hope you...

3567
03:57:00,040 --> 03:57:01,260
I hope you...

3568
03:57:02,700 --> 03:57:04,660
Got them all done and passed.

3569
03:57:07,720 --> 03:57:07,860
Yeah.

3570
03:57:09,880 --> 03:57:10,520
But.

3571
03:57:12,000 --> 03:57:12,180
Yeah.

3572
03:57:12,360 --> 03:57:13,720
Thank you guys again for letting it.

3573
03:57:13,820 --> 03:57:16,280
For being a little flexible with me and.

3574
03:57:19,760 --> 03:57:21,980
Letting me play bloons today instead.

3575
03:57:22,700 --> 03:57:23,180
Tomorrow though.

3576
03:57:24,820 --> 03:57:25,460
Endurance.

3577
03:57:26,980 --> 03:57:27,900
Atlantis non-nasal.

3578
03:57:28,940 --> 03:57:29,580
Endurance.

3579
03:57:31,400 --> 03:57:32,040
I...

3580
03:57:32,160 --> 03:57:32,920
I'm nervous.

3581
03:57:34,780 --> 03:57:37,380
To be honest, I'm nervous.

3582
03:57:41,120 --> 03:57:42,000
But, um...

3583
03:57:42,620 --> 03:57:43,880
I played a little bit.

3584
03:57:44,740 --> 03:57:46,200
I, like, played a little bit last night.

3585
03:57:46,340 --> 03:57:48,360
And I was like, oh, God.

3586
03:57:50,220 --> 03:57:52,380
I think I got to stage three.

3587
03:57:53,740 --> 03:57:56,260
And I think there's 99 stages or something in this.

3588
03:57:57,980 --> 03:57:59,400
Of course, it's always a good time with the other.

3589
03:57:59,400 --> 03:58:00,340
Yeah, thank you.

3590
03:58:01,020 --> 03:58:02,080
Thank you so much.

3591
03:58:03,060 --> 03:58:12,820
Thank you guys for the funny ice monkey And all the super
chats and everything I always appreciate you guys so much

3592
03:58:12,820 --> 03:58:25,080
Endurance stream Yes, endurance stream I came back from my
vacation to Tokyo this month Oh my gosh Otsu Otsu, it's

3593
03:58:25,080 --> 03:58:37,080

I'm gonna do I'm, hold on, I am planning on not using save

3594
03:58:37,080 --> 03:58:44,420
states at all, so, um, we'll see how that goes.

3595
03:58:45,280 --> 03:58:46,260
What kind of a game is it?

3596
03:58:46,420 --> 03:58:50,860
It's just, I know you like MGS.

3597
03:58:51,300 --> 03:58:53,860
I wear an eye patch and I'm told I kind of look like Big
Boss.

3598
03:58:54,400 --> 03:58:54,780
Really?

3599
03:59:01,920 --> 03:59:04,380
How, I mean, that's so cool.

3600
03:59:08,550 --> 03:59:09,470
Thumbnail though.

3601
03:59:10,730 --> 03:59:12,690
Roy, welcome to Mambushif.

3602
03:59:13,150 --> 03:59:13,490
Thank you!

3603
03:59:13,890 --> 03:59:15,050
Thank you, thank you.

3604
03:59:16,230 --> 03:59:17,390
Thank you for the laughs of the stream.

3605
03:59:17,790 --> 03:59:19,730
Yeah, maybe a little safe state as a treat.

3606
03:59:19,970 --> 03:59:20,330
No, no.

3607
03:59:21,210 --> 03:59:21,910
No, no, no.

3608
03:59:22,030 --> 03:59:22,810
No safe states.

3609
03:59:23,710 --> 03:59:23,950
Nope.

3610
03:59:25,090 --> 03:59:27,850
I gotta do it with all skill.

3611
03:59:30,350 --> 03:59:31,270
All skill.

3612
03:59:34,330 --> 03:59:35,450
Hopefully we make it.

3613
03:59:38,190 --> 03:59:38,670
Hopefully.

3614
03:59:39,130 --> 03:59:40,130
We will see, though.

3615
03:59:41,830 --> 03:59:42,810
We will see.

3616
03:59:43,930 --> 03:59:45,210
Get ready for rage.

3617
03:59:48,850 --> 03:59:49,890
I'll do my best.

3618
03:59:50,410 --> 03:59:53,650
So, with that, I am going to go to sleep then because I got
to be up.

3619
03:59:55,170 --> 03:59:55,970
What time is my stream?

3620
03:59:56,130 --> 03:59:59,790
I think it's two or three for my time.

3621
04:00:10,600 --> 04:00:11,860
14 hours from now.

3622
04:00:12,000 --> 04:00:12,560
Sleep tight.

3623
04:00:12,680 --> 04:00:13,280
Thank you.

3624
04:00:13,880 --> 04:00:15,500
Oh my gosh, you guys.

3625
04:00:17,540 --> 04:00:19,000
Well, actually, no.

3626
04:00:19,420 --> 04:00:19,580
Never mind.

3627
04:00:20,900 --> 04:00:23,220
I'll save this for later.

3628
04:00:23,400 --> 04:00:24,120
I'll save this for later.

3629
04:00:26,260 --> 04:00:30,080
You'll have to watch the next episode of Find Out.

3630
04:00:31,080 --> 04:00:31,880
Otsamito, everybody.

3631
04:00:32,660 --> 04:00:33,040
Otsamito.

3632
04:00:33,240 --> 04:00:33,780
Actually, you know what?

3633
04:00:33,800 --> 04:00:42,000
Since we're here, and it's our first time in the New Made
Cafe, I'm going to let the artist know that I used it.

3634
04:00:42,060 --> 04:00:42,980
She said I could.

3635
04:00:43,960 --> 04:00:47,680
There's actually one other thing that I commissioned from
this artist, so.

3636
04:00:49,200 --> 04:00:50,480
But it's not done yet.

3637
04:00:50,760 --> 04:00:51,960
And I was like waiting.

3638
04:00:52,300 --> 04:00:55,580
I was like, maybe I should hold out on showing the
background.

3639
04:00:55,740 --> 04:00:57,200
But I was like, it's May Day.

3640
04:00:58,760 --> 04:01:03,360
So I do kind of want to show my new maid cafe on May Day.

3641
04:01:04,080 --> 04:01:05,100
It felt a little perfect.

3642
04:01:14,800 --> 04:01:15,280
Bustin!

3643
04:01:17,300 --> 04:01:17,780
Bustin!

3644
04:01:21,800 --> 04:01:22,760
Also, Anthony!

3645
04:01:24,220 --> 04:01:25,740
I saw your stream labs.

3646
04:01:26,520 --> 04:01:28,160
Thank you for the spooky number!

3647
04:01:28,980 --> 04:01:29,680
Made channel.

3648
04:01:31,200 --> 04:01:32,380
Oh my gosh, I missed this!

3649
04:01:32,500 --> 04:01:33,500
Oh my gosh, I'm so...

3650
04:01:33,500 --> 04:01:35,320
I don't know what's wrong with the sounds.

3651
04:01:35,660 --> 04:01:36,620
This is a sound test.

3652
04:01:36,840 --> 04:01:37,380
Minto cute.

3653
04:01:37,440 --> 04:01:38,500
Minto is extremely cute.

3654
04:01:38,800 --> 04:01:40,060
Thank you for the Akadono!

3655
04:01:42,500 --> 04:01:43,280
Tell you something.

3656
04:01:44,260 --> 04:01:48,340
If there's something weird, I'm sleeping in your bed.

3657
04:01:48,560 --> 04:01:48,840

3661
04:02:08,260 --> 04:02:16,200
Sorry, I couldn't give you better seats to the stage, but
you know, it's just, you know, it's a pretty crowded day,

3662
04:02:16,300 --> 04:02:16,540
you know.

3663
04:02:18,460 --> 04:02:19,500

3664
04:02:20,440 --> 04:02:21,480
Sleeping in your bed.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3666
04:02:26,640 --> 04:02:28,060
An invisible man.

Sleeping in your bed.

I'm so sorry about the stream labs, though.

3671
04:02:34,580 --> 04:02:39,680
I will see what is wrong with them so that the sounds come
back.

I ain't afraid of no sleep.

3680
