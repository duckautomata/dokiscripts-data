00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,940
Oh my god!

2
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,120
Spooky!

3
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,140
Happy Halloween!

4
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:16,960
You guys probably don't know any of these songs, well maybe some of them, but I'll do my best.

5
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,760
To my stream!

6
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,680
Thank you!

7
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:54,040
準備運動しよう 中に内装 柔軟 君への想いを 鍛えてるです あの日の失敗 取り戻せ 君の通路 往復して 行き出して 告白した私 パチで振った君に I try to act tough, but it's just a one-sided fight.

8
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,020
I love you.

9
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,660
Even if you turn your back on me, I'm a zombie.

10
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,240
You're the only one I have in place of you.

11
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,360
I can't even cheat on you.

12
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,240
See, I'm always chasing you with a dash.

13
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,740
Don't be attracted to me.

14
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,980
Even if I put on make-up, my heart is pure.

15
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,080
No matter how many times I do it, I'm still a zombie.

16
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,240
I love you.

17
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,160
After all, I have no choice but to love you.

18
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,240
The truth is...

19
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,940
Turn the wheel of fate a little more.

20
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,140
No matter how many times I do it, I'm still a zombie.

21
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,320
I love you.

22
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,080
Zombie Bridge, let's cross it.

23
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,420
Let's cross it, let's cross it.

24
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,680
Zombie Bridge, let's cross it.

25
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,360
Let's cross it, let's cross it.

26
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,100
Zombie Bridge, let's cross it.

27
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,520
Let's cross it, let's cross it.

28
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,960
Zombie Bridge, let's cross it.

Maybe you guys have never heard that mix before!

90
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,590
But that was the Deer Stage Mix!

91
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,050
Woo!

92
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,410
Okay, I'm really sorry for this next one.

93
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,210
Actually, I didn't practice this at all, this next one.

94
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,090
So, I have to kind of rush because I want to get through all my songs.

95
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:56,490
Um...

96
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,270
Uh...

97
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,550
Let's try...

98
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,090
Oh, I'm really sorry for this one.

99
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,570
You guys can hate me after this, it's okay.

100
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,230
Ew!

101
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,930
Oh my god, what is this?

102
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,130
What are these sound effects?

103
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,890
Oh my gosh, I'm really nervous about this one.

104
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,890
Okay, I'm not even gonna look at the chat.

105
00:11:16,510 --> 00:12:09,350
I was edging to a gyaat late last night When my eyes beheld a skibbity sight Where the true Sigma Rizzler began to rise And violently mogged the Costco guy He did the mash He rizzed the bops and gyaats The monster mash Gave him a smash or a pass He did the mash He put the fries in the bag He did the mash He rizzed up all the gyaats From the back rooms in the Ohio streets Where the wolf inside me is at last at least The gooners all jelked to grow their jodes To get tips from me cause I'm a Luke's max prize He did the mash He rizzed up all the gyaats The monster mash Gave him a smash or a pass They put the fries in the bag.

106
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,030
He rizzed up all the gas.

107
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,670
The streamers were all doing the gritty.

108
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,970
Maybe Gronk just rizzed up Livi.

109
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,210
I don't know who any of these people are.

110
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:27,090
TheRizzlerBot, BigJustice, AidenRoss, and Kai...

111
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,710
I can't do this anymore.

112
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,570
I'm so excited.

113
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,610
Oh,

114
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,330
it's DanceAndDrake.

115
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:40,710
Surprise!

116
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,550
They rizzed up all the gas.

117
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,270
Gave them a smash or a pass.

118
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,650
They put the fries in the bag.

119
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,390
He rizzed up all the gas.

120
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,750
Pausing his stream meant Phantom did yap.

121
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,290
Seems like Doki Bird was about to cap.

122
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,730
Looked around to see if there was enough movement and said...

123
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,550
Did you guys know the low taper meme is still massive?

124
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,850
He rizzed up all the gas.

125
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,430
Gave them a smash or a pass.

126
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,950
They put the fries in the bag.

127
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,690
He rizzed up all the gas.

128
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,610
Everybody loves Skippity.

129
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,270
He's our ultimate Giga Chat.

130
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,830
And my brainwrap bash is the hit of the land.

131
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,590
For you, the beta, this bash was meant to...

132
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,090
The funniest meme ever is Haktua.

133
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,010
He rizzed up all the gas.

134
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,690
Gave them a smash or a pass.

135
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,230
They put the fries in the bag.

136
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,830
He rizzed up all the gas.

137
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,850
Got good.

138
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,070
Easy, Motara, you sussy Ohio.

139
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,710
Got good.

140
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,030
Got good.

141
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,570
Easy, Motara.

142
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,390
Got good.

143
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,660
I'm so sorry.

144
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,160
Anyway...

145
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,160
Wait, why is it only just one ear?

146
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:32,920
Oh my gosh.

147
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,720
Wait, hold on you guys.

148
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,400
Oh no!

149
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,340
There's scuff!

150
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,680
Wait, there can't be scuff!

151
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,000
I don't have time for scuff!

152
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,880
Wait, hold on.

153
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,720
Oh shoot!

154
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,580
Oh shoot!

155
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh shoot!

156
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,860
Wait, hold on.

157
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,340
Oh my gosh, how do I get to my folders?

158
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:52,960
Hold on.

159
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:55,660
Um...

160
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,000
I might just have to skip a song.

161
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,060
No, I was gonna do Busted, but then why is it so...

162
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,060
Guys, I don't know how to get to my fol...

163
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,440
Oh, I know how to get to my folders!

164
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:04,960
Hold on.

165
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:10,850
I think I have it.

166
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,810
This is so...

167
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:16,910
Okay, it's just gonna be in one ear.

168
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,710
Why is it so...

169
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,030
Wait, I can fix this.

170
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,110
I think.

171
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,310
How do I fix this?

172
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,850
Nah, it's just gonna be in one ear.

173
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,650
This is so bad.

174
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,510
Guys, it's just in my right ear right now.

175
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,450
Why is it in just one ear?

176
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,690
Singular Busted...

177
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,610
I don't know why.

178
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,590
If there's something strange, sleeping in your bed.

179
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,310
Let me tell you something.

180
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,990
If there's something weird, sleeping in your bed.

181
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:58,810
Ow!

182
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,110
Let me tell you something.

183
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,150
Busted makes me feel good.

184
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,730
I don't know why.

185
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,130
It's just in the right ear.

186
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,730
Busted, Busted, Busted...

187
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,930
Busted, Busted, Busted...

188
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,130
Busted!

189
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,130
Oh my god.

190
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,570
If you're seeing things, sleeping in your bed.

191
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,880
Sleeping in your bed.

192
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:40,720
Ow!

193
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,080
Let me tell you something.

194
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,080
Ow!

195
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

196
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,180
Busted.

197
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,140
Busted!

198
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,280
Busted.

199
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,760
Feel good!

200
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,720
Feel good!

201
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,200
Feel good!

202
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

203
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,780
Breaking Ghost Man!

204
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,300
Breaking Ghost Man!

205
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,040
Breaking Man, baby!

206
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,600
Snoring.

207
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,840
Let me tell you something.

208
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,120
Sleepin' makes me feel good!

209
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,500
I ain't afraid of no sleep.

210
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,000
I ain't afraid of no bed.

211
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,810
Yeah,

212
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,530
yeah.

213
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,190
Feel good, feel good, feel good.

214
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

215
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,370
Bustin', bustin', bustin' makes me feel in

216
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,420
the right gear.

217
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,360
I'm sorry.

218
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,320
Bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin'.

219
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,660
I'm sorry.

220
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,140
I don't know the problem.

221
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,240
I'm sorry.

222
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,100
Bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin' makes me feel good.

223
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,980
Yeah, baby!

224
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,300
You might have thought that might be my last song, but I have one last song.

225
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,440
Everybody, oh my gosh, I hope you've been enjoying the relay so far.

226
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,200
Everybody has sounded so amazing.

227
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,280
And Ashiki was right before me.

228
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,860
She sounded incredible.

229
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,220
Thank you, Spectra and Maria for hosting it.

230
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,300
And after me, I believe is Pippa.

231
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,420
Cute penguin.

232
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,780
Thank you for joining us.

233
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,040
Thanks for having me.

234
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,640
So, yeah, one last song.

235
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,500
It's a TV size though, because I don't think I could sing the whole one.

236
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,960
And also, I don't remember the middle of it.

237
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,480
So, and I'm also in a lot of pain.

238
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,160
Oh, what just happened there?

239
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:05,940
Weird.

240
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,520
You guys know this one, maybe?

241
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,220
The most zombie song.

242
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,140
Well, not the most.

243
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,480
I'm a zombie today.

244
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,000
Did you notice?

245
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,440
And I have a zombie set list, mostly.

246
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,200
Okay.

247
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,140
Thank you, guys.

248
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,680
Enjoy the rest of the relay.

249
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,300
This is Mii Phantom.

250
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,860
Bye-bye.

251
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:54,960
Bye-bye.

252
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,960
Or this was Mii Phantom.

253
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:56,920
Anyway, bye.

254
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:57,560
Bye.

255
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,840
Wait, how do I stop the song?

256
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,220
Oh, hold on.

257
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,860
Fade out.
