1
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,600
You guys can hear it, right?

2
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,980
You guys can hear it, right?

3
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,420
Some people were like, what are you doing?

4
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,380
It's the music!

5
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,980
It's the background music!

6
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,640
You hear it?

7
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,460
It's kind of like...

8
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,460
Friday the 13th.

9
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,400
Choo choo choo.

10
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,300
Ah ah ah.

11
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,700
Choo choo choo.

12
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,080
The music is a little quiet.

13
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,860
It's so loud in my ear.

14
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,030
It's so loud for me.

15
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,060
It is not quiet.

16
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,500
Put it like here.

17
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,840
Should be better, right?

18
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,300
It's loud.

19
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,160
I don't know what they mean.

20
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,140
Ma'am, I joined your membership, but I have a request.

21
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,640
Could you use your OL skills to really sell your membership to me?

22
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,980
Sales pitch.

23
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,760
When you hear sales pitch, what do you think?

24
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,880
You might be intimidated.

25
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,020
You might think, I don't want to be sailed to...

26
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,280
And, you know, I'm tone-deaf, so pitch is not my forte.

27
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,960
I don't even like using the word forte.

28
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,780
Because I'm not musically inclined.

29
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,120
But, I would say that...

30
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,380
Um...

31
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,700
That my pitch is...

32
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,320
Pitch perfect.

33
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,000
Ahhhh!

34
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,380
And if you want more quality content such as that...

35
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,120
You should join my memberships.

36
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,300
The Memboo ships.

37
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,260
Sold.

38
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,460
Thank you.

39
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,400
Wait, now I'm low and the game is loud?

40
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,940
Okay, I'm gonna turn it back down then.

41
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,400
Oh.

42
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:25,820
Oh.

43
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,180
I think

44
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,480
I have to do it manually.

45
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,400
Wait.

46
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,160
Okay.

47
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,520
Okay.

48
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,800
Thank you guys for the gift and thank you.

49
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,960
I'll take your entire stock.

50
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,520
Thank you.

51
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,660
Thank you guys.

52
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,320
Thank you.

53
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:51,760
Thank you.

54
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,340
Wait, it lit up for like two seconds.

55
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,440
They turned into fake buttons.

56
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,340
What happened?

57
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,280
What even happened?

58
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,670
Oh, see, see, see.

59
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,250
It lit up.

60
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,430
Maybe...

61
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't know.

62
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,820
I have no idea.

63
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:35,880
Anyway.

64
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,060
Hello everybody.

65
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,160
Welcome to That's Not My Neighbor.

66
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,040
Woop.

67
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,220
Um...

68
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,480
Eh...

69
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,000
It's a game kind of like...

70
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,320
Uh...

71
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,920
Hold on.

72
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:52,260
It's a game kind of like a Paper Please where you...

73
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,940
Um...

74
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:59,360
If you don't know that game, like you have people coming and you have to see what is...

75
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,860
What...

76
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,760
They are not who they say they are.

77
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,160
It might be that their nose is wrong or their...

78
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,800
Their...

79
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,160
They might have multiple eyeballs.

80
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,040
Who knows?

81
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,020
Anything is possible.

82
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,520
No.

83
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,900
That is not Solid Neighbor.

84
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,380
Exactly.

85
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,100
Glory to Arstotzka.

86
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,180
Yes, but today we are...

87
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,160
I don't know where we are actually.

88
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,000
Wait!

89
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,820
It's February 1955.

90
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,420
We're in old-timey.

91
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,840
Dear Mint, you are getting one guide.

92
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,960
Love, Cheggie.

93
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,740
I can't tell anymore.

94
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,520
I can't tell anymore.

95
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,500
I can't...

96
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,080
I can't tell anymore.

97
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,640
Will Georgie be there?

98
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,140
It's hard to say.

99
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:48,960
Georgie...

100
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,340
Georgie is the best guy, but...

101
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,760
We might have imposter Georgie.

102
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,740
It's kind of like...

103
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,320
Yeah, like the...

104
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,080
Like some of these guys are like trying...

105
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,140
Trying to dress up as your neighbor, but they are not real.

106
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,980
They are like...

107
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,560
Spooky monsters and stuff.

108
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,360
So it's kind of fun.

109
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,880
So let's...

110
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,060
Let's just play it.

111
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,420
I...

112
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,540
I've never played this before, so...

113
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, see?

114
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,360
The Doppelganger?

115
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:13,480
The Doppelganger?

116
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,080
Doppelgangers you let in don't kill you immediately, but at the end of the run.

117
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,580
Okay.

118
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,780
Get a score rank at the end of the...

119
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,200
I can't...

120
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,800
I mean, I can't choose anything else, so...

121
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,840
Doppelgangers is what they are called.

122
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,500
Okay.

123
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,580
Possibility to find and complete the Chester's Quiz.

124
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,920
I have no idea what that is.

125
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,840
I've never played this before.

126
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,260
Oh.

127
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,200
But we are going to check it out.

128
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,280
Eww.

129
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,120
The following short film is a production of DDD with Educational Phi.

130
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:43,480
Okay.

131
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,660
Finds.

132
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:44,960
Finds?

133
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,800
Hello, if you're watching this film, it's because you're the new doorman in your building.

134
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,820
Your job is to determine whether the person who wants to enter the building is a doppelganger.

135
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,420
As everyone knows, doppelgangers have the ability to transform into another person and impersonate them.

136
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,720
But some are not too good at it and could generate imperfections.

137
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,540
You have to pay close attention to the appearance of your neighbors.

138
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,380
I have to be really judgmental.

139
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:19,940
Got it.

140
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,460
Also, remember to fill out the checklist for each neighbor.

141
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,760
Okay.

142
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,700
You can't miss any detail because it could mean death for you and your neighbors.

143
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:31,660
Ah!

144
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,100
This is the structure of your office.

145
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,580
Now we are going to explain how it works.

146
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,600
This is so cute.

147
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,700
Here is the security window.

148
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,220
Don't forget to observe very well each individual who approaches.

149
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,360
Okay.

150
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,720
My big eyes.

151
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,560
On the right, you have the folders with all the data of each neighbor according to the respective floor.

152
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,940
To fill out the checklist, take each one of the lists in front of you.

153
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:07,780
What?

154
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,020
Receive documents from this hatch.

155
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,200
Okay.

156
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,220
I should probably be paying attention, right?

157
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,480
Be, be, be.

158
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:24,320
If you determine that the individual isn't a doppelganger, then allow them into the building with these buttons.

159
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,740
The apostrophe.

160
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,660
Otherwise, if you determine that it is in fact a doppelganger, press the emergency button and call 3312.

161
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,360
Okay.

162
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,760
To communicate with the neighbor.

163
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,120
DDD.

164
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,520
Or any apartment in your building, use the telephone in front of you.

165
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,280
I've never seen a telephone before.

166
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,260
Oh, hot dog.

167
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,140
Yippee.

168
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,840
Yee-haw.

169
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,580
We're in the future.

170
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,200
Your job is really important, so make sure you do it right.

171
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,320
What was the number?

172
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:54,980
Uh-oh.

173
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,460
Finally, we congratulate the doorman of the month, Henry.

174
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,880
It wasn't that he did an excellent job, but he was the only doorman in the area who didn't get killed by doppelgangers.

175
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,280
3312, be like Henry.

176
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,420
But better.

177
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,200
Okay.

178
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,220
Aw, he looks so...

179
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,840
Like, okay.

180
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,020
Every time...

181
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,880
Every time...

182
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,360
Oh!

183
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,260
Welcome and congratulations on your new job.

184
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,460
Oh, that's right here.

185
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,060
It's 3312.

186
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,540
As you can see in the introductory film, your job is to verify the entry of the neighbors of your building.

187
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,860
Each day, there will be a list.

188
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,640
A list of individuals who will request entry to the building.

189
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,140
It is possible that there are individuals who request entry and aren't on the list.

190
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,800
In which case, you will mark on the checklist that they are not on the list and proceed to question the individual.

191
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,380
Also, you must verify that the ID and the entry request are correct and have the respective DDD logo.

192
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,700
Don't forget to also check the expiration date on the IDs.

193
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,120
Remember, it's February 1955.

194
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,940
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

195
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,120
I wish you good luck.

196
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,240
See ya!

197
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,540
Okay, that was a lot of reading.

198
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,960
That was a lot of info at the very beginning.

199
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,260
Oh!

200
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,960
Good afternoon!

201
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,860
This guy looks like a real Muppet.

202
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,940
He looks like a Muppet on the run.

203
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,840
Oh my gosh.

204
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,160
Mucho texto.

205
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,820
Roman Stiltski.

206
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,520
483924059684.

207
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,280
Uh-huh.

208
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,240
With the DDD.

209
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,400
There's an idol I like that has a song called DDD.

210
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,400
So now I can't get it out of my head.

211
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,200
DDDDDDD.

212
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,260
I love you.

213
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,880
Entry request.

214
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,900
Roman Stiltski.

215
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,740
Apartment F0101.

216
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,680
I'm a resident of the building.

217
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,560
I've come from my job as a public accountant.

218
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,560
Accountant!

219
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,300
Why do you have that scar if you're just an accountant, huh?

220
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,100
Hmm?

221
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:11,940
Hmm?

222
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,720
Wait.

223
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,300
So I have to see this list.

224
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,320
Well, why aren't you on the...

225
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,740
Oh, wait.

226
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,000
Okay.

227
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,420
Checklist.

228
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:18,840
Checklist.

229
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,120
ID seems good.

230
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,580
Also, he's wearing a hat.

231
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,540
Oh, here.

232
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,140
Roman Stiltski.

233
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,060
Accountant.

234
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,020
Appearance.

235
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,440
Big nose.

236
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,700
Scar on right chin.

237
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,440
Long face.

238
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,640
One eyebrow.

239
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,980
Wears a hat!

240
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,280
Oh!

241
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,220
Where's the hat?

242
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:38,620
Where's the hat?

243
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,020
Where's the hat?

244
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,360
Where's the hat?

245
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,040
Wait.

246
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,840
One eyebrow.

247
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:43,700
ID.

248
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,320
Appearance.

249
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,860
Is it on today's...

250
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,160
No.

251
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:47,920
Question.

252
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,440
I'm not on today's list because I had to leave due to an emergency at work.

253
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,020
Is that a valid response or...

254
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,320
Entry request.

255
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,540
Wait.

256
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:03,880
What's the...

257
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,720
Is this the entry...

258
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,100
Oh, yes.

259
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:07,400
Caller.

260
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,200
Caller.

261
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,900
I'm not on today's...

262
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:09,960
Oh.

263
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,440
That's sus.

264
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,480
Oh, call the apartment.

265
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,000
You're right.

266
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,300
You're right.

267
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,440
You're right.

268
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,440
Oh.

269
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,520
I don't know the apartment.

270
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,100
Ah!

271
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:17,760
Ah!

272
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,260
Go back.

273
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,580
Go back.

274
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:18,980
Go back.

275
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,280
Go back.

276
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:19,440
Go back.

277
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:19,880
Uh.

278
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,040
Uh.

279
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:22,920
One.

280
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,180
One.

281
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:24,660
Five.

282
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,060
Two.

283
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:26,820
One.

284
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:28,920
One.

285
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,460
One.

286
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,120
Five.

287
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:35,700
Two.

288
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,040
One.

289
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:42,780
Yes?

290
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:43,900
Hello?

291
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,560
Lois Stillski speaking.

292
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,260
My husband is not at home.

293
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,700
Okay.

294
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,720
So, he actually did go.

295
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,280
Is he back?

296
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,560
Maybe.

297
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,680
I don't know.

298
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,700
Is it him?

299
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,280
It could NOT be him.

300
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,020
It could be an impostor maybe.

301
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,540
And his card was nineteen...

302
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,180
They wouldn't give me a fake guy on the first run, right?

303
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,200
Mo-si-mo-si.

304
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,780
He seems okay.

305
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,530
Okay.

306
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,250
I hope we don't die.

307
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:23,950
Oh.

308
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,930
Hello, good day.

309
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,870
Hello, Miss...

310
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,830
Raftelan Kapachinan.

311
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,830
What?

312
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,770
These old-timey names.

313
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,710
Oh, she's on the list.

314
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,250
She's on the list.

315
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:44,910
She's on the list.

316
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,110
Wait.

317
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,370
W.

318
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,050
Afton?

319
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,570
Like a Mr. William?

320
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,430
William Afton?

321
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,830
Of Five Nights at Freddy's fame?

322
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,550
No way.

323
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,370
Also, isn't Mia Stone the name of an actress?

324
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:11,990
Okay.

325
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,530
Raftelian.

326
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,450
That sounds like reptilian.

327
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,010
I'm just saying.

328
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,570
Wait.

329
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,330
What floor are you on?

330
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,490
62.

331
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,270
03, 04.

332
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,510
I'm a resident of this building.

333
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,470
My apartment is on the...

334
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,510
Is the 04 on the third floor?

335
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,270
That's...

336
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,910
Oh, yeah.

337
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:32,950
Raftelian?

338
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,870
Reptilian?

339
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,910
Says she is a housewife.

340
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:39,950
Long face.

341
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:40,830
Big nose.

342
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,630
This is so judgmental.

343
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,170
Who are we to say that this is a big nose, right?

344
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,450
Hoo, hoo, hoo.

345
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,990
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

346
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,290
Hoo, hoo, hoo.

347
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,290
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

348
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,210
Straight hair.

349
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,830
She looks the same.

350
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,190
Right?

351
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,690
She wears a headband.

352
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,150
Yeah.

353
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,090
Freddy?

354
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,310
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

355
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,850
Oh, ID number.

356
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,010
Let's check if it's the same.

357
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:24,330
568...

358
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,190
554...

359
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,150
596...

360
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:33,450
329.

361
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,090
It's the same!

362
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,610
I'm... I think we're good.

363
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,290
She has a reason to go out.

364
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,030
She has a little thing, so I think we're good.

365
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,450
All right, ma'am.

366
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:42,430
Um...

367
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:45,690
Excellent.

368
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,770
The door, please.

369
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,530
You seem a little eager, Reptilian.

370
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,510
What if I just let you mingle out there, huh?

371
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,330
Blood on the dress?

372
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,430
I think that's a pattern.

373
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,710
I think that's a floral pattern.

374
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,370
Wait, her shirt's different?

375
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,010
Oh, we can't see her shirt.

376
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,230
I think that's a floral pattern.

377
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,470
I don't think that's bloody, right?

378
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,590
I can see the flower details on it.

379
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,210
Okay, let's let her in.

380
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,870
I don't like that sound.

381
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,650
It's so loud.

382
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:26,910
Okay.

383
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,630
I hope we don't die.

384
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,050
Oh!

385
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,270
Hello.

386
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,390
Lois... Stiltski?

387
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:36,650
Goddamn!

388
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,590
Mr. Stiltski!

389
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:40,890
Wait!

390
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,210
You were home!

391
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:46,910
Uh-oh.

392
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,590
Wait, she was...

393
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,970
That's not...

394
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:51,210
That's not...

395
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,610
That's not her!

396
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,810
She was home?

397
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:54,150
Remember?

398
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,110
We already talked to her!

399
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,210
Goddamn!

400
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,490
I mean, is this...

401
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,170
Is...

402
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,470
Is...

403
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,150
Is...

404
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,550
Is this part fake, too?

405
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,790
Mr. Stiltski's...

406
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,470
He's a lucky man.

407
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,150
Let's do the checklist.

408
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:20,810
ID...

409
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,990
They might be the same.

410
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,350
Nice.

411
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,890
Hey, I know it's...

412
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,790
I know it's fake, but I wanna just check everything.

413
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,430
You know, get our ducks in an order.

414
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,810
See what parts are fake.

415
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,850
You know, 8, 9, 4, 5, 6, 9...

416
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,470
7, 2, 3...

417
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,110
6, 5, 1...

418
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:37,890
Okay.

419
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,890
So this is...

420
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:39,550
Oh, no, no.

421
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,350
Oh, wait, yes.

422
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,090
My teeth?

423
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:45,850
Ah!

424
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,510
They are for better eating, my dear!

425
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,670
Okay.

426
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,390
What does that mean?

427
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,630
I already answered your question.

428
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,650
She's getting a little spicy with me.

429
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:00,610
Eating what?

430
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,150
Yeah.

431
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,730
Eating what, ma'am?

432
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,990
Big lips, mole on left cheek...

433
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,610
Cheek!

434
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,330
Round face.

435
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:08,650
Short hair.

436
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,750
She does have a pretty round face.

437
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:11,830
It's the teeth, though.

438
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:13,630
Entry request?

439
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:15,310
Oh, yeah.

440
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,170
She's obviously not on the list.

441
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,090
So...

442
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:19,810
Oh, wait.

443
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,330
She does have a...

444
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:20,470
She does have a...

445
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,650
She does have a...

446
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,230
I'm not on today's list because I had to leave due to an emergency.

447
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,210
I'm gonna call the apartment.

448
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,290
What was it?

449
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,170
1-1-5-2.

450
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,350
I wanna see what they say.

451
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:32,630
1...

452
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:34,650
5...

453
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:36,210
2...

454
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,320
A likely story.

455
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,120
I like this version of Total Detective.

456
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,200
Hello.

457
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,780
Roman Stiltski speaking.

458
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,120
My wife and I are in the apartment right now.

459
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,420
Wait.

460
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,280
We are not expecting any information.

461
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,920
We're expecting a few visitors today.

462
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,120
What if...

463
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,880
What if...

464
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,400
What if this is the real wife?

465
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,220
Wouldn't that be crazy?

466
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,120
Um...

467
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,760
3-3-1-2!

468
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,260
Eject!

469
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:04,880
Eject!

470
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,480
Eject!

471
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:05,760
Eject!

472
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,860
The call is coming from inside the house.

473
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:14,820
What?

474
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,260
Oh, I have to push the button first.

475
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,060
Um...

476
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,260
I don't know how loud this is gonna be, so I'm gonna turn it down just a little bit.

477
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,640
Okay, that wasn't so bad.

478
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,320
3-3-1-2.

479
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,440
Emergency!

480
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,540
Emergency!

481
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,420
You have contacted the D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D.

482
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,820
A group of agents has been sent to your building.

483
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,000
Thank you.

484
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,020
Please wait for the cleaning protocol to run.

485
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,200
Cleaning protocol?

486
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,140
Oh!

487
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,360
Cleaning protocol completed!

488
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,680
Thank you, sir.

489
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,160
You can continue your job.

490
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,480
Thank you very much for your service.

491
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,340
Cool.

492
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,640
Good work, Minto.

493
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,680
Thank you.

494
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,660
Good afternoon.

495
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,760
Where is your entry request?

496
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,280
My entry request?

497
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:17,800
Yes.

498
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,480
Your entry.

499
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,680
I think everything's fine with my...

500
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,000
Oh, I mean, where's your ID?

501
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,540
Sorry.

502
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,600
Uh, uh...

503
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,600
Lift up, lift up.

504
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:28,920
There we go.

505
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

506
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,260
Yes, I forgot to show my ID.

507
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,160
Oh.

508
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,300
You had it this whole time.

509
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,280
Hyper, thank you for the gift.

510
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,800
Thank you so much.

511
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,700
Gloria Schmidt.

512
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,160
I think I do remember seeing her on the list.

513
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,040
Yes.

514
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,440
0201...

515
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,580
1974, DDD.

516
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,140
Mm-hmm.

517
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,460
I'm a resident of this building.

518
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,700
I came from my job as a banker.

519
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,820
Wait, what floor are you again?

520
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,180
Two.

521
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,120
She's a banker?

522
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,340
Round face.

523
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,200
Mole on right cheek.

524
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,260
Short hair.

525
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,500
Round nose.

526
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,360
Round nose.

527
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,060
Right cheek.

528
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,500
Short hair.

529
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,380
Do we trust bankers?

530
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,920
Let's check her ID number.

531
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,640
698522...

532
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,580
698522...

533
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,260
341-150.

534
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,240
Yes?

535
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,440
I believe this one is...

536
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:38,960
Wait, what is this?

537
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:39,700
Oh.

538
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,820
Oh, that's handy.

539
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,540
Hmm.

540
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,780
Oh, so I can minimize...

541
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,620
Oh, that's so handy.

542
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,440
That's so handy.

543
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,840
I think she's good.

544
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,600
If we get eaten...

545
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,860
Oh, wait.

546
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,880
Let me complete the checklist.

547
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,900
So, is everything in order?

548
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:00,900
Yes.

549
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,380
Can you open the door for me?

550
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,460
Yes.

551
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,080
Did you call her house?

552
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,140
Oh, thank you.

553
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,460
512...

554
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,540
Well, she was on the list.

555
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,420
But it's probably better, right?

556
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,340
5123.

557
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,920
Yeah, let's call.

558
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,320
Let's call.

559
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,960
5124, Arnold...

560
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,020
Whoa, the audio got weird.

561
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,720
Arnold, shh.

562
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,980
My wife is not at home.

563
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,220
Okay.

564
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,240
She's here.

565
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,100
Is she back?

566
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,900
She might be.

567
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,080
She could be a doppelganger?

568
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:49,880
Okay.

569
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,160
Minty can't slack.

570
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,000
I know, I'm sorry.

571
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,420
Oh my gosh.

572
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,420
Is this Emma Stone?

573
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,140
Good afternoon.

574
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,360
Good afternoon.

575
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:57,420
Good afternoon!

576
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,880
Mia Stone!

577
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,890
1978, DDD.

578
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,330
Who is Emma Stone?

579
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,770
I just know that name, but who is she?

580
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,810
She is an actress?

581
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,510
Oh, okay.

582
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:36,990
I'm a resident of this building.

583
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,170
My apartment is on the... is the 01 on the third floor.

584
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,130
Oh!

585
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,530
I was on the...

586
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,130
Oh my gosh, what a beautiful couple.

587
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,130
She's a teacher, long hair, small, small round nose.

588
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,290
I'll be the judge of that.

589
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:02,030
Now, if you're looking for a small round nose, I would use mine as an example, but...

590
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,050
You know what?

591
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,650
Whatever makes her feel good.

592
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:06,350
You know?

593
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:11,890
Has freckles, oval face, thin eyebrows.

594
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,630
What nose?

595
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:15,790
What nose?

596
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:16,550
What nose?

597
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,110
You have no nose!

598
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,490
I have a nose!

599
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,610
I have a nose!

600
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,270
Look, you can see it.

601
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,250
See that?

602
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,190
See that nose in all its pointed glory?

603
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,290
Oh,

604
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,620
God!

605
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,360
I can't blow my nose!

606
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,520
I have no tissue!

607
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,020
Okay, we're fine.

608
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,320
No!

609
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,240
Okay.

610
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,160
We're okay.

611
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,480
Sorry.

612
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,040
Sorry to...

613
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,740
She's just standing here so patiently, like, I hope I don't get eaten.

614
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,740
789-564...

615
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,780
789-564 or 525-115.

616
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,080
525...

617
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,320
Oh!

618
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,840
I was looking at the 4-5-2... 525-115.

619
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,260
Okay!

620
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,260
Um...

621
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,100
She is on the list.

622
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,060
Excellent.

623
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,420
Can you open the door for me?

624
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,180
Not until I...

625
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:28,540
Oh, wait.

626
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,020
Your husband?

627
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,140
He might not be home either.

628
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,380
Oh, whoops.

629
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:31,860
But we'll try.

630
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:32,300
We'll try.

631
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,560
Uh... 1425.

632
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:39,980
1425...

633
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,900
I don't think he's gonna be home.

634
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,380
They're working... They're a working couple.

635
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,420
So neither of them are home?

636
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,020
Dozo?

637
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,620
I can't say I'm a huge fan of that beeping sound.

638
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,300
It's kind of...

639
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,340
Oh, like that.

640
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,500
Oh, it's so loud.

641
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,060
It's so loud.

642
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,360
Ah!

643
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:10,780
Uh...

644
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,140
Hello, uh...

645
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,720
Celine?

646
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,000
Uh...

647
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,800
Uh...

648
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,910
Whoa!

649
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,690
Celine and Eleanor Nguyen live together.

650
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,430
Wait, they're... they're twins.

651
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,510
Uh...

652
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,450
Oh, it's Nacha!

653
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,870
Nacha Cheese!

654
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,040
Or, in this case, Nacha... Nacha Body.

655
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,320
Not... Nacha... Nacha You!

656
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,180
Hahaha...

657
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,760
Hahaha...

658
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:01,940
Um... uh...

659
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:03,760
Yes?

660
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,300
I'll take that now.

661
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,200
All right, what about your appearance?

662
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,980
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

663
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,800
Um... you don't have an entry request either.

664
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,740
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

665
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,920
Yeah, I mean...

666
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,680
I'm... I'm...

667
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,980
Nacha neighbor.

668
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,700
Yeah, yeah, Nacha neighbor.

669
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:23,800
Hahaha...

670
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,240
Uh... hmm...

671
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,220
I don't know, guys, what should we do with her?

672
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,800
I feel kind of bad.

673
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,820
Looks like she's had a hard day, you know?

674
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,920
Like, imagine if you, like, go and get a haircut.

675
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,220
You don't tell anyone.

676
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,280
Or, like, you know...

677
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,620
Some... someone, like, jumps you in the back alley and steals your eyes and your mouth.

678
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,920
And, like, you can't... you can't report that right away.

679
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,000
You can't tell them, like, hey...

680
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,740
Sorry, I got jumped in the alley and they stole my kidney and my eyes.

681
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,400
Sell on the black market.

682
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,980
Typical Friday.

683
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,060
Hahaha...

684
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,880
Like, and then... and then I have to call the police on you?

685
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,100
Like...

686
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,480
This is such a bad day.

687
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,980
She just wants to go home.

688
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,820
Poor Nacha.

689
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,840
Poor Nacha.

690
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,140
Hahaha...

691
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:20,900
Okay.

692
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:21,760
Emergency!

693
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,420
Three, three, one, two.

694
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,120
They're coming to get you.

695
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,120
Little doppelganger.

696
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,860
You're in danger.

697
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,160
I'm gonna skip this, okay?

698
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,240
Cleaning protocol completed!

699
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,580
Thank you!

700
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,620
You can continue your job.

701
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,380
I wish I didn't.

702
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,940
That was frightening.

703
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,480
I hope they cover therapy.

704
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,240
Oh!

705
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:56,960
Hi.

706
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:57,860
Oh...

707
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,960
Are you guys gonna say it?

708
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,380
Or...

709
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Am I gonna?

710
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,060
Uh...

711
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,760
Oh!

712
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,650
My appearance?

713
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:19,770
Nose?

714
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,490
My nose?

715
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,710
I was born with out a nose.

716
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,350
Oh my gosh.

717
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,050
It's normal for humans!

718
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,060
He was born without a nose.

719
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,880
It's normal.

720
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,960
You heard him.

721
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,380
You heard Mr. Robertski Peachman.

722
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,280
Peach fuzz.

723
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,660
Oh, he looks so weird.

724
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,460
I am a resident of the building.

725
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,700
I come from my job as a shoemaker.

726
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,160
Shoemaker 0102.

727
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,220
Yes, shoemaker 2668.

728
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,680
Also, he's not on the list.

729
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,980
Am I not on today's list?

730
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,560
I think there is an error.

731
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,440
I should be on the list.

732
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,760
Look at the list again.

733
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,120
I didn't.

734
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,560
Not there, mister.

735
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,380
I already answered your question.

736
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,100
Red flags.

737
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,660
Let's call 2668.

738
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,340
What if he picks up?

739
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,000
Got your nose.

740
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,900
Take the L, bro.

741
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,780
I know.

742
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,320
Hello, Robertski Peachman.

743
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,100
Wait, isn't that who that guy is supposed to be?

744
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,380
My brother and I are in the apartment right now.

745
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,060
Are you expecting visitors?

746
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,060
We are not expecting any visitors today.

747
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,780
Without the nose, he looks so much more suspicious.

748
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,380
Okay, buddy.

749
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,040
I think we're going to have to...

750
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,970
He did bring up a good point.

751
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,350
Not everybody has a nose.

752
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,790
Not everybody has a nose.

753
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,830
Oh, three.

754
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,810
I forget that I have to call.

755
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,910
What if I just sit here for long enough?

756
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,670
Do they get mad?

757
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,270
Bust him.

758
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:36,790
Bust him.

759
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,110
Yeah, we're busting this guy.

760
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,990
Cleaning protocol completed.

761
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,910
How many more do I have to do?

762
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,960
How long is the day?

763
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,560
Milkman!

764
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,100
Hello.

765
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,240
Hello.

766
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,520
Francis Moses.

767
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,440
1964.

768
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,700
I'm a resident of the building.

769
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,960
I come from my job as a milkman.

770
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,140
No way.

771
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,040
He's really a milkman.

772
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,560
What was your 302?

773
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,700
Oh, appearance.

774
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,100
For some reason, I read appearance.

775
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:25,640
Milkman.

776
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,560
Long nose.

777
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,360
Thin chin.

778
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,660
Tired eyes.

779
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,840
Short hair.

780
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,060
Can you take off your hat for me, please?

781
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,300
Oh, where's a hat?

782
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:41,700
Never mind.

783
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,120
Okay, Francis.

784
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,100
Let me check your...

785
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,300
Two, three.

786
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,480
Five.

787
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,960
Five, six, nine.

788
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,820
Two, three, five, five, six, nine, four, one, eight.

789
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,960
Nine, nine, five.

790
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,820
Thank you.

791
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,580
Wait, I can't read it.

792
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,020
This game is all about keeping the uggos out.

793
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,080
Don't be mean.

794
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,300
No.

795
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,720
Don't be mean.

796
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,980
Wait, is he on the list?

797
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:15,920
Oh, he is.

798
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,680
I think this guy is a green flag.

799
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,420
Perfect.

800
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:21,560
Perfect.

801
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,260
The door.

802
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,020
You could say, please.

803
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,720
Hold on.

804
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,340
Before I do that, I am going to...

805
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,040
I think it would be under sound, right?

806
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,440
Oh, but I want you to still hear them and stuff.

807
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,860
I just hate this sound.

808
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,060
It's so loud.

809
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,080
He's tired, Mint.

810
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,820
Yeah, me too.

811
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,580
Wait, is this the elusive Afton?

812
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,560
Dr. W.

813
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,800
Wait, where's the rest of your name?

814
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,440
Oh, Afton.

815
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,380
1971.

816
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,900
We know he's on the list.

817
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,220
Oh, my God.

818
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,500
Excuse me.

819
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,140
Where is your entry request?

820
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,280
Here is my entry.

821
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:12,580
Okay.

822
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,660
Just kidding.

823
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,100
I am a resident of the building.

824
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,980
I come from my job as a psych...

825
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,520
physicist.

826
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:19,980
Physicist.

827
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,300
Okay.

828
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,020
Yes, sir.

829
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,340
Physicist.

830
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,680
301.

831
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,100
Physicist.

832
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,840
Robust eyebrows.

833
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,280
Quite.

834
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,420
Wears glasses.

835
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,620
Short hair.

836
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,480
Yes.

837
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,420
Round nose.

838
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,800
Yeah.

839
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,200
Square head.

840
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,480
I hope nobody writes these for me.

841
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,820
I hope nobody writes these sorts of like...

842
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,620
Like, what would you write for me?

843
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,680
For my appearance?

844
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,560
Oh, my gosh.

845
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,540
Thank you for the 20.

846
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,900
Thank you for the 20 gifted.

847
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,720
You're a simp.

848
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,220
Thank you, Joshua.

849
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,300
You're an absolute jewel.

850
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:23,660
You're an absolute jewel to watch.

851
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,080
And I have been having so much fun watching your streams.

852
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,700
Keep that idol heart shining, Mint.

853
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,740
Have you ever heard of the band called Band Maid?

854
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,160
I have.

855
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:31,580
I have.

856
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,200
I don't know a lot about them, though, which is funny.

857
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,100
You'd think that they'd be like everything I love, you know?

858
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,420
250489.

859
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,000
250489.

860
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,820
And we know we called earlier, so we know he's out.

861
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:46,800
He's good.

862
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,490
Dork shape head.

863
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:53,770
Stop.

864
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,190
Stop.

865
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:00,690
Ocelot.

866
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:03,870
McCloy.

867
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,090
Rudd Boys.

868
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,030
1958.

869
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,050
Oh, you're about to expire.

870
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,710
I'm a resident of the building.

871
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,270
I come from doing the shopping.

872
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,490
There he is.

873
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,330
For real.

874
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,050
He's retired.

875
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,750
Oh, he did go shopping.

876
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:25,630
Has a mustache.

877
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,390
Yup.

878
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,290
Big nose.

879
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:31,830
Yup.

880
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,130
Goatee.

881
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:35,870
Yup.

882
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,130
Smokes.

883
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,250
Yup.

884
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,570
Always wears a hat.

885
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:45,990
Yup.

886
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,290
Except in this picture.

887
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,310
How did you get in?

888
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,510
I think we're all good.

889
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,030
And he was on the list, right?

890
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:00,910
Oh,

891
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:05,710
let me call his house.

892
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,850
Can you open the door for me?

893
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,310
4242, give me a second.

894
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,370
Sir?

895
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,430
Oh, oops.

896
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:23,410
I grouped the 4 and the 2s together in my brain.

897
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,030
Liquid.

898
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:34,490
Nerd walk, lack of nose, otaku stink, sinister demeanor.

899
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,110
Oh, my father is not at home.

900
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,050
Okay, cool.

901
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,310
Don't worry about this.

902
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,590
Just a note for future reference.

903
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:41,450
I hate this.

904
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,490
Get in there.

905
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,010
Go home.

906
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,040
How many more people do we have?

907
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:51,800
Oh!

908
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,510
Ever dream this clown?

909
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:03,510
Every night, all over the world, hundreds of people see this clown in their dreams.

910
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:06,390
If this clown appears in your dreams, don't play any game with him.

911
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:11,330
If you want more information, go to nachogames.itchio slash unlikely.

912
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,450
It's an ad!

913
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:18,590
Hey!

914
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,390
Skip ad, skip ad.

915
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,510
Oh, my gosh.

916
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,510
I can't believe we got an ad in our game.

917
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:32,790
Hello!

918
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,470
Margaret Bubbles.

919
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,910
Yes, Margaret Bubbles.

920
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:46,290
Your eyes are looking a little lazy.

921
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,430
It's okay.

922
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,030
It's probably your charm point.

923
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:50,810
0203.

924
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,790
She's a seamstress.

925
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,630
Curly hair.

926
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,930
Oh, my God, it is!

927
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:58,990
Deviated left eye!

928
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,890
It is actually a charm point.

929
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,630
Round nose.

930
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,070
Yeah.

931
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,550
Big smile.

932
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,390
Big smile.

933
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,230
Okay.

934
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,950
I'm not dreaming of the clown.

935
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,050
I'm dreaming of Bubbles.

936
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:17,910
Jumbo.

937
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,510
I said jumbles.

938
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:23,550
Is Bubbles your dream lady?

939
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:30,210
I'm dreaming of Margaret Bubbles.

940
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:31,670
Hmm.

941
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:34,710
What?

942
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:35,670
Oh, let me check her ID.

943
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:37,670
First.

944
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:44,770
103-268-014-590.

945
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,130
I think she's good.

946
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,390
Enjoy the rest of your life.

947
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,830
I'm not brave enough to marry this woman.

948
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,750
She would make a man out of you.

949
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:58,870
Hello.

950
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,710
You're one of the sisters.

951
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,350
You're Celine's sister.

952
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,030
1980.

953
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,370
Wait, are you on the list?

954
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,490
Celine's sister.

955
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:10,730
I'm a resident of this building.

956
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:12,150
My apartment is on the fourth...

957
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,630
Is the 04 on the first floor?

958
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:16,590
She's...

959
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,250
Okay.

960
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,820
The mole is on the correct side.

961
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,320
She's got the earrings.

962
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:26,700
Okay.

963
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,540
Mole on right cheek.

964
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,040
Small pointed nose.

965
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,060
Yes.

966
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,120
Slim.

967
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,800
Okay.

968
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,460
Long neck.

969
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,080
Okay.

970
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,220
She has a twin.

971
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,100
That's not an appearance.

972
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,480
That doesn't mean anything.

973
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,160
That doesn't mean anything.

974
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,020
Let's try...

975
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,860
6...

976
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,560
9...

977
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,920
9...

978
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,400
6...

979
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,240
What was the other sister's name?

980
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,400
Elise or...

981
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,380
Illinois...

982
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:11,880
Illinois's...

983
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,540
sister.

984
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,700
My sister is not at home.

985
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:15,980
Okay.

986
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:16,680
Oh.

987
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:17,620
Okay.

988
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,120
Fine.

989
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,140
785-613.

990
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,120
785-613.

991
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,980
269-514.

992
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,820
Sorry.

993
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:29,940
We're good.

994
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,540
Have a nice life.

995
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,320
What am I...

996
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:36,800
I just...

997
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,660
I locked the door in front of her.

998
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,400
Mm-hmm.

999
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,380
Oh.

1000
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,760
Good afternoon.

1001
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,960
Mr. Albertzki Peachman.

1002
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,800
What is up with the peaches?

1003
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,280
Why?

1004
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,480
What?

1005
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,820
Do they have a lot of money or something?

1006
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,440
No.

1007
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,880
Their name...

1008
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,620
They are peaches!

1009
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,520
They sound delicious!

1010
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,860
That's why all the monsters want to impersonate and eat them.

1011
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:18,940
Peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, I love you!

1012
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,320
We might want to ask him about the eye thing.

1013
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,160
Come from my job as a shoemaker.

1014
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,260
Was he on the list?

1015
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:28,600
No...

1016
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:32,780
My appearance?

1017
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,480
Yeah, I just want to know.

1018
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,420
I don't see anything strange with my appearance.

1019
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,080
I can see it well with my one eye.

1020
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,680
Welcome to membership, thank you!

1021
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,500
Minto droopy eyes, no nose, tiny cute dead.

1022
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:53,820
Tiny cute dead?

1023
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,180
Always wears a mid dress.

1024
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,860
Until the day I don't.

1025
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,940
That would be shocking.

1026
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,720
I already answered your question.

1027
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,040
I want to see if he gets like a little upset, you know?

1028
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,160
Like if he's just like, hey!

1029
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:23,940
Maybe not.

1030
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,700
I think it's time we um, danger.

1031
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,240
Thanks for the vibe gift!

1032
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,420
Thank you!

1033
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,380
Three, three, one, two!

1034
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,390
Don't you roll your eye at Mint.

1035
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:47,710
Yeah, don't roll your eye at me mister.

1036
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:51,930
Nice.

1037
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:53,390
I'm gonna continue my job.

1038
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,270
When will this day end?

1039
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:57,170
Do you guys hear the...

1040
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:01,530
I want to know if it's part of the game or if you guys hear like the buzzing also.

1041
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:03,910
I can't tell if it's my headphones or not.

1042
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:05,370
Good afternoon!

1043
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,550
Um, where is your entry request?

1044
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:09,530
Thank you.

1045
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,090
Oh, you do hear the buzz?

1046
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:11,590
Okay.

1047
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:13,150
I think it's the game then.

1048
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:14,430
I was worried it was my headphones.

1049
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:17,170
You are not on the list!

1050
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:19,230
Uh...

1051
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:22,730
Am I not on today's list?

1052
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:24,450
Thanks for the gift.

1053
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:26,590
I think there is an error.

1054
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:28,090
I should be on the list.

1055
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,630
Look at the list again.

1056
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,700
I don't see you on the list.

1057
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,620
What's your name?

1058
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,900
Arnold Schmidt.

1059
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,920
I came... I come from my job as a writer.

1060
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,860
You have the wrong mustache!

1061
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,740
What's wrong with my appearance?

1062
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,120
Look carefully at the photos of my papers and compare them well with me.

1063
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:00,800
This guy!

1064
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,540
You are not slick!

1065
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,340
I love though that the... actually...

1066
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,880
This doppelganger actually went to like the department and was just like, hey!

1067
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,480
I'm here to renew my ID!

1068
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,720
It was like, I've got to get a new picture!

1069
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,960
New year, new me, new mustache!

1070
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:36,600
778-566 219-322 Let's call home 5123.

1071
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,420
People can change mustaches.

1072
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:44,980
Not here!

1073
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,700
Not in this 1955!

1074
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:47,820
That is ridiculous!

1075
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,660
That is absolutely absurd!

1076
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,780
Gloria Schmidt speaking, yes.

1077
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:52,560
Where's your husband?

1078
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,700
They're in the apartment right now!

1079
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:02,160
Are you expecting a second husband?

1080
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,520
Are you sure you don't want...

1081
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,640
What's better than one husband?

1082
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:07,360
Two!

1083
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,260
What if this is like...

1084
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,940
This is like her...

1085
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:16,080
Her like side husband.

1086
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,640
It looks like the exact same.

1087
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,280
She has a very specific type.

1088
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,700
Just this guy has a silly mustache instead.

1089
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,100
Goodbye!

1090
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,440
Doppelganger?

1091
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:39,470
Side husband.

1092
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:39,950
Yeah.

1093
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:45,570
Gosh, you guys are busy today!

1094
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:47,730
Do we usually get this many...

1095
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:49,590
This many...

1096
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:51,370
Doppelgangers?

1097
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:52,910
No wonder I'm needed.

1098
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:53,450
Wow!

1099
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,210
Thank you so much for that 20!

1100
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:58,990
Thank you!

1101
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:04,970
Hello, Steven.

1102
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:21,390
My face?

1103
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:22,090
Yeah.

1104
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:24,750
A paper?

1105
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,210
I don't know what you're saying.

1106
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,830
I'm pretty sure we called this guy earlier.

1107
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:34,070
I'm pretty sure he...

1108
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:37,190
Yeah, we had to call him to see about his dad.

1109
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:39,690
Big nose...

1110
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:45,050
Wears sunglasses...

1111
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,630
Not the smiley face emoji.

1112
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:54,490
I thought you guys were like warning me about spoilers.

1113
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:57,570
Short hair...

1114
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:58,450
Small hair...

1115
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:00,650
What's wrong with the size of his head?

1116
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,170
His head is normal!

1117
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:03,670
What do you mean?

1118
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:05,410
Ghost of Mint!

1119
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,350
Oh my gosh.

1120
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:07,810
Wait.

1121
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:09,010
You're a ghost of a ghost?

1122
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:10,130
That's crazy.

1123
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,310
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

1124
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:11,790
Thank you.

1125
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,190
What's wrong with the size of his head?

1126
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:16,890
4'2".

1127
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:18,490
Yes, remember because I messed this up.

1128
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:19,890
4'2".

1129
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,230
4'2".

1130
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:31,390
Steven speaking.

1131
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:34,750
My father and I are in the apartment right now!

1132
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:40,410
Are you not expecting a second self?

1133
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:42,370
Hmm...

1134
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:44,610
I'm gonna give you one last shot mister.

1135
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:50,670
I wanna see actually... Hold on.

1136
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:51,190
What if I do this?

1137
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,410
I wanna try this.

1138
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,630
So is everything in order?

1139
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:04,550
Can you open the door for me?

1140
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:04,930
Can you open the door for me?

1141
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:05,990
Oh.

1142
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:06,590
Dang.

1143
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:07,650
I thought like...

1144
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:10,110
Peek a peek a peek a peek.

1145
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:12,750
I thought something funny would happen, you know?

1146
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:14,730
Alright.

1147
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:15,210
Gosh.

1148
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:17,890
These guys just need to remain on site too.

1149
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,030
Let him in!

1150
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:24,510
We're playing the game proper now.

1151
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:27,790
We'll have some fun like shenanigans stuff later.

1152
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:30,650
Oh.

1153
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:31,010
Oops.

1154
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:31,650
Skip.

1155
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:31,890
Skip.

1156
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:32,790
Skip.

1157
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,350
Skip cleaning protocol.

1158
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:37,790
Can't stop yawning!

1159
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,330
Thank you sir.

1160
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:42,170
Thank you.

1161
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:44,610
How much longer?

1162
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:47,090
Oh!

1163
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:51,490
100% accuracy.

1164
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,190
Six doppels.

1165
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:56,790
Neighbors killed zero.

1166
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,190
Zero?

1167
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,510
Rank S.

1168
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:01,470
Oh!

1169
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:05,130
Easy!

1170
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,510
Easy!

1171
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:11,150
Nice detail.

1172
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:14,610
Nice detail.

1173
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,280
Play again.

1174
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,720
Skip.

1175
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:29,980
Skip.

1176
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:30,500
Goodbye.

1177
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:30,860
Goodbye.

1178
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,480
Hello.

1179
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:34,280
Hello.

1180
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:34,300
Wow.

1181
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,220
Peach Man!

1182
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,240
Good afternoon, Peach Man.

1183
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,400
Give me your ID.

1184
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:44,180
Yes.

1185
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,160
You forgot to show your ID.

1186
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:48,140
Can't believe that Cyclops was a doppel.

1187
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,780
They're really tricky, aren't they?

1188
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,460
They really try to get you.

1189
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,320
Let's see.

1190
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:58,920
Albertsky Peach Man.

1191
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,000
Hmm.

1192
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,540
I'm arisen at this building.

1193
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,240
I come home from my job as a shoemaker.

1194
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:08,220
You're both shoemakers?

1195
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,940
Oh.

1196
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,940
You both are actually shoemakers.

1197
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:13,080
Let's see.

1198
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,840
Your hair seems to be in order.

1199
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,080
Your nose.

1200
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:17,580
Yeah.

1201
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:18,140
Yeah.

1202
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,620
Prominent chin.

1203
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,900
Very much so.

1204
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,740
You have the big chin.

1205
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,100
Your brother has the no chin.

1206
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,320
What?

1207
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,120
They don't write that in the appearance though?

1208
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,000
No chin?

1209
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,200
I guess they have a little bit of...

1210
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,040
A little bit of self...

1211
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,700
A little bit of respect for these...

1212
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,680
For these...

1213
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,700
For these residents, huh?

1214
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,800
He looks too convincing.

1215
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:41,660
Let's check his numbers.

1216
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,440
146512?

1217
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,000
146512... 986...

1218
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,060
96354...

1219
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,380
Are you on the list?

1220
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,120
He is!

1221
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:52,540
Wow.

1222
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,100
There's not so many people on the list today.

1223
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,520
Yes.

1224
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,160
Peter Griffin looking guy.

1225
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,280
Don't be rude.

1226
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,980
Good afternoon, Arnold Schmidt.

1227
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:26,840
That's you.

1228
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,780
Come from my job as a writer?

1229
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:31,480
Wait.

1230
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:32,760
Oh!

1231
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,240
All the apartments are different now too.

1232
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:36,960
201...

1233
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,000
Or I'm just going crazy.

1234
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,260
He is a writer!

1235
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:40,800
Oh!

1236
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:41,820
He is a writer.

1237
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,140
778...

1238
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,300
566...

1239
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:50,880
219...

1240
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,640
322...

1241
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,200
Yep.

1242
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,320
Big eyebrows.

1243
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,260
Yeah.

1244
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,280
Prominent mustache.

1245
00:54:58,760 --> 00:54:59,160
Yeah.

1246
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,160
Wears a hat.

1247
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,480
Round face.

1248
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:04,090
Yeah.

1249
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:04,410
Yeah.

1250
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:05,750
Short hair.

1251
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:07,850
Yeah.

1252
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,230
Mustache looks different.

1253
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:11,130
No.

1254
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:11,970
It's the same.

1255
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,950
And he is on the list.

1256
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:15,650
Oh!

1257
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:15,950
You know what?

1258
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:17,750
I forgot to call the previous person.

1259
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:18,110
Didn't I?

1260
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:19,070
Whoopsie.

1261
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:22,490
5123.

1262
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:23,170
Let's try again.

1263
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:24,150
Let's try this.

1264
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:28,170
We could have died first try.

1265
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,310
First person.

1266
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:30,530
Hmm.

1267
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:32,450
I guess we'll see at the end of the day.

1268
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:36,730
Gloria Schmidt speaking.

1269
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:38,510
Gloria Schmidt speaking.

1270
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:39,510
My husband is not at home.

1271
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:40,070
Okay.

1272
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:40,290
Good.

1273
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:44,330
What if I try calling them right now?

1274
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:45,850
What if I try calling them right now?

1275
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:46,070
You know?

1276
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:51,010
What was the floor?

1277
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:53,450
Where did that guy live?

1278
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:55,510
Oh here.

1279
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:56,810
2668.

1280
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:57,490
Let's just...

1281
00:55:57,490 --> 00:55:57,970
Let's try.

1282
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:01,630
2668.

1283
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:03,070
Yeah.

1284
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:03,910
Let's try calling now.

1285
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:04,350
Oh wait.

1286
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:05,890
Oh they might be...

1287
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,430
If they don't pick up, maybe they're dead.

1288
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:13,290
Oh my gosh!

1289
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:14,270
He's alive!

1290
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:17,090
My brother and I are in the apartment right now.

1291
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:18,330
And there's an intruder!

1292
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:19,450
Oh my god!

1293
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:20,130
We're dead!

1294
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:22,450
Save us!

1295
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:29,610
I think we're good.

1296
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:30,150
Okay.

1297
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:36,890
We just have to burn...

1298
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:38,630
It's like when you see a spider in your room.

1299
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:39,570
You just have to...

1300
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:42,050
42?

1301
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:44,290
You just have to burn the whole place down?

1302
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:44,670
42.

1303
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:47,170
43.

1304
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:48,470
Oh!

1305
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:50,210
42, 42, 42.

1306
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,010
42, 42, 42.

1307
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:54,750
Is this 42 ones?

1308
00:56:55,590 --> 00:57:00,730
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

1309
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:02,610
12 times 3.

1310
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:10,330
2, 4, 6, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42!

1311
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:12,310
Who would have thought?

1312
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,940
I think he means well.

1313
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:41,100
He's quite obviously just trying to teach the youngins how to count.

1314
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,420
I've never seen Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy so...

1315
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,560
He's a man who knows what he wants.

1316
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:54,460
42!

1317
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,460
Not 41.

1318
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,000
Not 43.

1319
00:57:58,620 --> 00:57:59,220
42!

1320
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:01,780
Anyway...

1321
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,360
Oh.

1322
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:08,960
I just realized that the date actually didn't change which is kind of disappointing.

1323
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:22,750
Thank you!

1324
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:23,150
Thank you!

1325
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:26,070
What are the trophies that I keep getting?

1326
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:27,870
Are they under here?

1327
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:30,630
Or maybe on the menu.

1328
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:40,270
When I was a part of hockey team, my number was 42.

1329
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:41,310
No way!

1330
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:44,170
Hi or whatever.

1331
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:46,130
Hi.

1332
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:46,190
Hi.

1333
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:48,990
Anastacia.

1334
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:50,810
Anastacia.

1335
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:53,270
1985.

1336
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:56,850
I live here.

1337
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:57,130
Whatever.

1338
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:58,730
I come from school.

1339
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:00,350
Okay.

1340
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:00,990
Oh my gosh.

1341
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:02,130
She's got her little Seifuku.

1342
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:02,810
So cute.

1343
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:06,030
She's not on the list though.

1344
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:07,830
Ma'am, you are not on the list.

1345
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:12,070
I'm not on today's list because I had to leave due to an emergency.

1346
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:12,750
Or whatever.

1347
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:12,950
Ever.

1348
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:16,330
What one was she?

1349
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:17,130
Oh, here.

1350
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:18,770
Tired eyes.

1351
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:20,630
Yeah.

1352
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,130
Two ponytails.

1353
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:24,710
Yeah.

1354
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,110
Small nose.

1355
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:29,790
Round face.

1356
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:32,090
She checks out.

1357
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:44,490
132 698 53 44 Yeah.

1358
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:46,990
We're gonna call Chef.

1359
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:49,210
Wait.

1360
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:50,410
What if she's not there though?

1361
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:51,430
Okay.

1362
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:53,970
1346

1363
00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:01,550
1346 Welcome to Mamusha.

1364
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:02,210
Thank you.

1365
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,080
Hello.

1366
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:08,960
What?

1367
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:12,190
My mother is...

1368
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:15,290
Whatever.

1369
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:30,790
Sneaky.

1370
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:32,410
What if I say, like, ID?

1371
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:34,610
My ID?

1372
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:35,910
Are you gonna get mad at me?

1373
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:36,750
Little doppelganger?

1374
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:38,890
I don't see anything wrong with my ID.

1375
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:42,050
Whatever.

1376
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:42,610
Oh my gosh.

1377
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:44,250
She's even got her mannerisms down.

1378
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:47,130
What's wrong with my appearance?

1379
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:51,150
Everything is in order with my appearance.

1380
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:54,030
Whatever.

1381
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:55,770
She's even got her mannerisms down.

1382
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:56,210
Whatever.

1383
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:00,390
My entry request?

1384
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:03,310
My entry request?

1385
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:05,030
Everything is fine with my entry request.

1386
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:07,010
Everything is fine with my entry request.

1387
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:08,170
Everything is fine with my entry request.

1388
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:09,430
Is that a zipper on her back?

1389
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:10,290
This right here?

1390
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:13,390
Let's check her picture.

1391
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:15,950
No.

1392
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:17,410
She has it in the original too.

1393
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:18,330
I think it might be...

1394
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:21,290
Maybe part of the backpack.

1395
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:25,110
Like the handle bar of the backpack.

1396
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:25,570
You know?

1397
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:26,570
Okay.

1398
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:26,990
Anyway.

1399
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:35,110
Three, three, one, two...

1400
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:39,630
What's stopping these doppelgangers from just, like, climbing the window?

1401
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:40,470
What's stopping these doppelgangers from just, like, climbing the window?

1402
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:40,670
You know?

1403
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:42,230
Whatever.

1404
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:45,990
That was tricky.

1405
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:48,570
If we hadn't called...

1406
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,770
Imagine, like, the first one!

1407
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:53,610
The first one was completely fine.

1408
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:54,250
The first one was completely fine.

1409
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:56,110
If we hadn't called...

1410
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:58,450
Well, I guess...

1411
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:00,730
Well, he was on the list, actually, now that I think about it.

1412
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:01,350
Oh my gosh!

1413
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:01,830
Emma Stone!

1414
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:03,770
Mia Stone!

1415
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:11,370
Came back from my job as a teacher.

1416
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:14,370
Her hips don't lie either.

1417
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:15,770
Wow.

1418
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:19,210
You are not on the list.

1419
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:23,590
Am I not on today's list?

1420
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:25,930
It must be a mistake.

1421
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,470
I should be on the list.

1422
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:30,390
No, you're not.

1423
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:31,530
You're not!

1424
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:33,210
Wait.

1425
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:34,330
Who do you live with?

1426
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:37,610
301?

1427
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:39,710
Oh yes!

1428
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:40,230
Of course!

1429
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:40,750
How could I forget?

1430
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:42,430
W.

1431
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:42,830
Afton.

1432
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:47,370
She looks the exact same.

1433
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:49,750
From what I can tell.

1434
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:52,350
Ahem.

1435
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:53,150
Hmm...

1436
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:55,490
1425.

1437
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:04,790
Hmm...

1438
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:13,030
The real giveaway for the last doppel was actually her entry request was missing the DDD logo.

1439
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:13,890
Wait.

1440
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:15,270
Who just picked...

1441
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:16,070
Oh!

1442
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:18,730
Oh, wait!

1443
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:19,830
Was that Afton?

1444
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:21,510
Sorry, I missed the name.

1445
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:22,990
I was reading the comment.

1446
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:26,970
Did he say Mia?

1447
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:31,070
That was Afton?

1448
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:31,910
Oh, okay.

1449
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:34,530
Then...

1450
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:35,970
I guess she...

1451
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:37,510
Okay, let's check the number.

1452
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:38,910
789...

1453
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:42,210
I need to be better about the DDD logos then.

1454
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:43,290
Because I didn't even notice at all.

1455
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:44,370
Good eye.

1456
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:47,590
789-564...

1457
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:49,370
525-115.

1458
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:57,490
Lady, make sure you properly get your stuff in order next time for going out.

1459
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:00,050
Yes.

1460
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:02,710
You need to properly get your stuff in order.

1461
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:05,690
It wasn't a mistake.

1462
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:07,630
You didn't fill out the proper paperwork.

1463
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:09,370
But I'm gonna let you in.

1464
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:11,030
Hmm.

1465
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:17,450
Hmm.

1466
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:18,110
Hmm.

1467
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:20,890
Hello, good day.

1468
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:21,570
Where's your ID?

1469
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:25,190
Sorry, here's my ID.

1470
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:27,930
Yeah, I was about to literally call the police on you.

1471
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:30,750
I was about to get your butt annihilated.

1472
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:35,830
They were going to come and they were going to literally destroy you.

1473
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:38,150
Reptilian.

1474
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:41,230
Hmm.

1475
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:48,810
But you know...

1476
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:50,550
I went out to visit my parents.

1477
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:52,210
I mean, she is on the list.

1478
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:56,330
Long face, big nose...

1479
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,830
Straight hair, wears a headband.

1480
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:06,260
568-554...

1481
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:08,560
596...

1482
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:10,260
329...

1483
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:11,900
Let me call your home.

1484
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,980
I must talk to ALF right away.

1485
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,440
4258...

1486
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,800
4... 2...

1487
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,740
5... 8...

1488
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:24,140
That guy looks like he's Bruce Wayne's butler.

1489
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,780
My goodness.

1490
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:28,420
Hmm.

1491
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,080
ALF speaking.

1492
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,980
My wife is not at home.

1493
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:34,720
Okay.

1494
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:36,760
Yes.

1495
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:37,540
Maybe.

1496
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:51,140
It could be some sinister beast waiting for you to trust it so that it can pounce and suck all your blood from your body.

1497
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,160
I forgot to show my entry request.

1498
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:01,440
How long have you been living here, Robertski?

1499
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:04,280
You forget to show your entry request every time.

1500
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,560
I'm sick of this.

1501
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,780
I'm just gonna... Oh!

1502
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:13,370
1-1-4-3.

1503
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:14,650
But also, he's not on the list.

1504
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:18,890
But, yeah, it is missing the logo, it's missing the logo.

1505
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:21,770
16 Nigeria.

1506
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,650
I already answered your question.

1507
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:27,710
1-1...

1508
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:31,330
1-1... Wait, where...

1509
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:33,070
1-1-4-6-5-2.

1510
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:41,550
1-1-4-6-5-2 2-8-9-7-3-0 3-8-9-7-3-0?

1511
01:06:44,810 --> 01:06:50,270
The appearance looks fine, but we must call your brother.

1512
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:55,950
Or... I mean, they kind of look like they'd be brothers more than lovers, right?

1513
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:58,330
I think?

1514
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:10,520
But isn't there a thing that some people like to date people they look like or something?

1515
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:11,620
I don't know.

1516
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:13,740
They're brothers.

1517
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:17,140
Robertski Peachman speaking.

1518
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:20,320
My brother and I are in the apartment!

1519
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:26,340
We are not expecting any visitors today.

1520
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,580
My entry request?

1521
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,980
I think everything's fine with my entry request.

1522
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,900
That's something a doppelganger would say.

1523
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:49,900
I'm not on today's list because I had to leave due to an emergency at work.

1524
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:55,740
Likely story...

1525
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,680
3, 3, 1, 2...

1526
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,520
I think this game is relaxing so much it's making me so tired.

1527
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:06,820
Oops, sorry if you just heard me kick my mic.

1528
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:10,700
I'd rather I need it while I was adjusting.

1529
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:13,060
Bust down.

1530
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:13,980
Bust him!

1531
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:14,540
Bust him!

1532
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,480
So sleepy today.

1533
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:22,610
Next please.

1534
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:25,790
Wait.

1535
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:32,890
Didn't we see you earlier or...

1536
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:38,750
Didn't we see you earlier?

1537
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:42,070
1, 4, 2, 5.

1538
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,460
We did?

1539
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,480
We just let her in?

1540
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:54,600
Pick up.

1541
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,360
Pick up.

1542
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:55,860
Pick up.

1543
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:57,620
Pick up.

1544
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:58,300
Pick up.

1545
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:58,960
Pick up.

1546
01:08:58,980 --> 01:08:59,160
Pick up.

1547
01:08:59,160 --> 01:08:59,300
Pick up.

1548
01:08:59,300 --> 01:08:59,640
Pick up.

1549
01:08:59,640 --> 01:08:59,900
Pick up.

1550
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:00,860
Pick up.

1551
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:02,660
Pick up.

1552
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:03,120
Pick up.

1553
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:04,320
Pick up.

1554
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:04,600
Pick up.

1555
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:04,700
Pick up.

1556
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:22,980
Pick up.

1557
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:28,990
Pick up.

1558
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:31,070
Clearly, that means there's two wives.

1559
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:52,790
Clearly, that means if I let both of them in, he'll be so hap- What's the difference in appearance?

1560
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:55,750
Did I get the appearance on the other lady wrong?

1561
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,570
Or is this the one that's the fake?

1562
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:02,270
Uh oh...

1563
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:09,590
This all looks good, though!

1564
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:12,430
This all looks good!

1565
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,480
Check the freckles...

1566
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:35,300
They look the same...

1567
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,220
Uh oh...

1568
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:43,680
Is the job right?

1569
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:43,780
Alright.

1570
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:45,860
Yeah.

1571
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:54,010
I checked the numbers.

1572
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:57,830
I checked the numbers.

1573
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:05,130
Let's check up again.

1574
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:12,030
789-564-525-115.

1575
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:12,550
Yeah.

1576
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:14,510
But I checked it last time too.

1577
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:27,820
Wait, but he would have been eaten though, right?

1578
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:31,180
Her birthday.

1579
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,820
This isn't the birthday.

1580
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,360
This is the expiration date.

1581
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,540
Sorry, the chat is kind of blocking it.

1582
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,260
But it's currently February 1955.

1583
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,960
I just checked the expiration.

1584
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:45,600
Make sure it's not.

1585
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:50,870
Call again.

1586
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:53,710
1-4-2-5.

1587
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:58,530
1-4-2-5.

1588
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:02,350
Oh my gosh, am I going to have to kill an innocent person?

1589
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:04,410
Maybe.

1590
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:07,830
Yeah, you're still alive?

1591
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:11,950
They're in the apartment.

1592
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:12,410
How?

1593
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:13,490
I just want to know.

1594
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:16,210
How?

1595
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:23,760
Sss.

1596
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:26,340
How would I know?

1597
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,740
That this is the impostor?

1598
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,120
They don't kill immediately?

1599
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:36,900
Look at the logos.

1600
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:37,400
I am.

1601
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:37,940
I am.

1602
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,700
I actually don't remember what the logo is supposed to look like.

1603
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,360
They don't give a reference.

1604
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,420
So I just have to believe that this is the correct thing.

1605
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,940
I think this is the real one.

1606
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,220
I think so too.

1607
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:03,130
Try asking questions again.

1608
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:05,510
My ID?

1609
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:08,970
I don't see anything wrong with my ID.

1610
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,280
What's wrong with my appearance?

1611
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:17,580
You...

1612
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,460
You...

1613
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:20,760
You...

1614
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:21,540
You...

1615
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:21,620
You...

1616
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:23,640
The eyeshadow is not flattering on you.

1617
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,820
Put them both in.

1618
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,440
Problem solved.

1619
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:35,780
Either way, even if I call the DDD on this lady, she's going to die.

1620
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:36,760
So, yeah.

1621
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:37,920
Okay.

1622
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,140
You're welcome, Mr. Afton.

1623
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,020
Now you have two wives.

1624
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:43,680
Lucky you.

1625
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:43,780
Lucky you.

1626
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:49,400
Good afternoon.

1627
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,500
Why are you not on the list?

1628
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,860
Now they both die.

1629
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:01,360
If I had called the DDD on the lady standing here, she would have died anyway.

1630
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:03,260
So now...

1631
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:04,200
You know...

1632
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,500
They're all just...

1633
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,400
They're all just...

1634
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,020
You know...

1635
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:09,400
It's just how the circle of life works.

1636
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:10,540
Gloria Schmidt.

1637
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:11,800
She's not on the list.

1638
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,320
But she is a banker.

1639
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:14,560
1974.

1640
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:20,950
Round face.

1641
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:25,430
Mole on right cheek.

1642
01:14:27,690 --> 01:14:28,790
The nose!

1643
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:29,970
The nose!

1644
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:30,490
The nose!

1645
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:31,010
The nose!

1646
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:31,430
The nose!

1647
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:31,950
The nose!

1648
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:34,010
The nose is wrong.

1649
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:36,010
What's wrong with my appearance?

1650
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:41,190
Look carefully at my photos of my papers and compare them well with me.

1651
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:41,630
Oh.

1652
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:42,850
Ma'am.

1653
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:44,750
I assure you, I am.

1654
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:48,130
I assure you, Gloria Schmidt of the bank.

1655
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:50,790
I am doing that.

1656
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:52,670
But I am going to call just in case.

1657
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:53,370
5...

1658
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:54,630
1...

1659
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:55,230
2...

1660
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:56,210
3...

1661
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:07,120
I think there was a grammar error when you asked about her appearance.

1662
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:13,440
I'm inclined to believe maybe that the game dev is maybe not...

1663
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:19,020
maybe English second language or something because there's been a lot of grammar errors.

1664
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:21,200
So I'm not kind of like putting that as a...

1665
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,360
as a...

1666
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:25,140
thing.

1667
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:32,220
Pop the button.

1668
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,160
Wee woo!

1669
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:33,880
Wee woo!

1670
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:34,180
Wee woo!

1671
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:41,250
Oh.

1672
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:42,170
Skip, skip, skip.

1673
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:43,750
Thank you, sir.

1674
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:44,650
Thank you.

1675
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:45,450
Thank you very much.

1676
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:46,210
Thank you.

1677
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:47,650
Call Afton back.

1678
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:48,270
You're right.

1679
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:49,930
We should...

1680
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:52,190
1-4-2-5...

1681
01:15:53,150 --> 01:15:54,110
Oh, I can't call yet.

1682
01:15:57,990 --> 01:15:58,390
Oh!

1683
01:15:58,650 --> 01:15:59,050
Oh!

1684
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:02,450
Heterochromia.

1685
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:03,510
Good afternoon.

1686
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:04,550
One second.

1687
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:07,690
I have to make sure someone else is dead.

1688
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:11,550
He's probably going to be like, look!

1689
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:13,630
Dorman, I have two wives!

1690
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:15,610
I'm the luckiest man in this world!

1691
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:18,430
Wait, what is he going to say?

1692
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:21,630
My fiancé and I are in the apartment right now.

1693
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:27,010
We're not expecting any visitors today.

1694
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:28,890
Interesting.

1695
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,850
Wait, does she usually have...

1696
01:16:31,850 --> 01:16:33,350
It's Nacha.

1697
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,710
0-2-0-4...

1698
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:40,750
Right eye blue!

1699
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:43,990
Left eye green!

1700
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:45,490
Wait, actually!

1701
01:16:46,050 --> 01:16:46,430
Oh!

1702
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:50,650
She does actually have heterochromia.

1703
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:52,430
Curly hair.

1704
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:54,090
Yeah.

1705
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:56,350
Freckles.

1706
01:16:57,370 --> 01:16:58,550
Round face.

1707
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:01,210
She looks good to me.

1708
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:04,090
But she's not on the list.

1709
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:08,710
You're right or hers?

1710
01:17:08,910 --> 01:17:11,270
It has to be her right, right?

1711
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:15,650
No, I'm pretty sure it's her right.

1712
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:18,890
Because everything else has said, like, mole on right cheek.

1713
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:19,690
And it's been correct.

1714
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:23,590
It's her right.

1715
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:24,730
It's her right.

1716
01:17:30,690 --> 01:17:31,390
She's a chef.

1717
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:34,750
Resident of the building.

1718
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:35,770
I come from my job as a chef.

1719
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:39,570
You can also kind of see it in the picture, too.

1720
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:42,570
See, like, this looks darker and this one looks lighter.

1721
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:46,430
Her nose is gone.

1722
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:54,030
6-5-5-4-1-3.

1723
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:56,090
I'm so sorry that I'm yawning so much.

1724
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:56,610
I don't know why.

1725
01:17:57,610 --> 01:17:58,670
1-3-4-6.

1726
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:05,800
I don't know how we got the first Mia wrong!

1727
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,500
I don't know!

1728
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,260
Nacha means butt cheek in Spanish.

1729
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,020
That's so mean!

1730
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,680
My mother is not at home.

1731
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:17,120
Okay.

1732
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,560
How did we mess up?

1733
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,400
How did we mess up?

1734
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,440
I still think second Mia was...

1735
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:31,120
Was wrong?

1736
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,440
I think you got the first Mia right.

1737
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:33,980
Really?

1738
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:34,880
You think so?

1739
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,520
You think maybe just because she was...

1740
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,260
Even though she was perfect...

1741
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:41,740
She...

1742
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:43,140
I don't know.

1743
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:44,640
Oh, whoops, sorry.

1744
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:45,700
Uh...

1745
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,220
What is underneath there?

1746
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,000
What was that?

1747
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:56,960
Um...

1748
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:02,730
Some doppelgangers can be perfect.

1749
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:03,170
They can?

1750
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:04,450
Oh.

1751
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:05,110
Well...

1752
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:06,890
I think he's really appreciative.

1753
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:08,230
Wait.

1754
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:10,190
Was it second floor?

1755
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:10,750
There we go.

1756
01:19:11,530 --> 01:19:12,750
She looks right to me.

1757
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:17,230
Even though you're not on today's list.

1758
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:17,730
Can you...

1759
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:18,770
Can you tell me again why?

1760
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:23,670
I think there's an error.

1761
01:19:23,790 --> 01:19:24,830
I should be on the list.

1762
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:27,490
Oh, well.

1763
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:32,850
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1764
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:33,310
Let her in.

1765
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:37,370
I almost just murdered an innocent lady.

1766
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:39,270
Oh, no.

1767
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:39,490
Oh, well.

1768
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:42,330
Oh.

1769
01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:45,210
Good afternoon.

1770
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:48,230
Oh.

1771
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:49,410
Angus.

1772
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:51,810
Prime beef.

1773
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:54,610
Five, six, five...

1774
01:19:54,610 --> 01:19:54,850
Wait.

1775
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:55,430
Where are you at?

1776
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:56,830
Oh, one, oh, three.

1777
01:19:57,690 --> 01:19:59,310
Five, six, five, zero, zero, three.

1778
01:20:00,510 --> 01:20:02,130
Six, nine, eight, eight, four, five.

1779
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:03,810
Yes.

1780
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:04,850
Business man.

1781
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:06,590
Long neck.

1782
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:09,250
Where are you?

1783
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:09,670
There's a hat.

1784
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:10,210
Mm-hmm.

1785
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:11,270
Has a mustache.

1786
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:13,530
Small eyes.

1787
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:20,830
68.

1788
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:22,370
D, D, D.

1789
01:20:22,370 --> 01:20:22,890
D, D, D.

1790
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:24,250
Resident of the building.

1791
01:20:24,350 --> 01:20:26,170
I come from my job as a businessman.

1792
01:20:28,710 --> 01:20:29,970
And you are on the list.

1793
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:32,130
I'm gonna call you...

1794
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:32,330
Wait.

1795
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:33,590
No one else would pick up.

1796
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:35,170
You're the only one home.

1797
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:36,110
Wait.

1798
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:36,970
What if I pick up and...

1799
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:38,230
Or what if I call and he's there?

1800
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:39,230
Okay.

1801
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:43,310
45513.

1802
01:20:46,330 --> 01:20:46,810
Brontosaurus.

1803
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:49,810
Oh my god, his teeth are like a whale's.

1804
01:20:49,910 --> 01:20:53,070
They look like, you know how whales have like, oh, yeah, he's not there.

1805
01:20:56,310 --> 01:21:04,970
You know how whales have like those really, they look like really packed together hay barrels.

1806
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:05,510
Ooh.

1807
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:08,390
Hello, peach man.

1808
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:09,230
What?

1809
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:10,870
Give me your ID, please.

1810
01:21:12,530 --> 01:21:13,410
Yeah, you did.

1811
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:14,510
You forgot to show your ID.

1812
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:16,650
Now I'm even more suspicious of you.

1813
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:23,760
Wasn't he here already?

1814
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:24,560
He was?

1815
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,300
Wait, where are you at?

1816
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:30,440
0102.

1817
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:32,980
2668?

1818
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:41,400
We're not gonna make the same mistake again.

1819
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:49,750
Robert Ski Peach Man?

1820
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:50,670
You and your brother?

1821
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:53,590
My brother and I are in the apartment right now!

1822
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:58,470
We are not expecting any visitors today.

1823
01:22:03,070 --> 01:22:05,010
And this one has no logo.

1824
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:12,460
I'm not on today's list because I had to leave due to an emergency at work.

1825
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,680
Likely story, doppelganger.

1826
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:24,530
Get... exterminated.

1827
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:27,150
What do they do with the doppelgangers?

1828
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:30,250
Why do we have a doppelganger problem anyway?

1829
01:22:37,690 --> 01:22:39,430
What kind of...

1830
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:43,750
What... what kind of... what is going on here?

1831
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:48,030
Skinwalker Ranch.

1832
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:49,770
Wow.

1833
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:50,910
Oh!

1834
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:53,670
Good afternoon!

1835
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:56,350
He looks like...

1836
01:22:57,450 --> 01:22:59,110
That one actor.

1837
01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:00,750
Isaac.

1838
01:23:03,610 --> 01:23:05,430
He looks like... John Stamos?

1839
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:07,390
Is that his name?

1840
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:10,550
Aliens.

1841
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:14,570
Did you guys know that there is an alien... ancient aliens...

1842
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:17,270
Like the TV show that there's a game?

1843
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:19,090
You can get it on Steam.

1844
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:20,710
I've thought about playing it.

1845
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:23,250
He's a reporter.

1846
01:23:23,930 --> 01:23:24,810
Big eyebrows.

1847
01:23:24,990 --> 01:23:25,630
Big smile.

1848
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:26,630
Prominent chin.

1849
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:28,050
Big nose.

1850
01:23:30,150 --> 01:23:31,550
Why are you so rude to him?

1851
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:32,630
Why are you so...

1852
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:36,070
Stream it?

1853
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:38,150
I've thought about it.

1854
01:23:40,190 --> 01:23:42,770
But it's one of those types of games where it's like...

1855
01:23:43,290 --> 01:23:44,710
Okay, build this thing.

1856
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:45,570
It's going to take...

1857
01:23:45,570 --> 01:23:47,770
It's going to take 12 hours to build.

1858
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:54,070
4, 5, 6, 9, 8, 5, 5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9.

1859
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:00,430
Resident of the building.

1860
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:01,770
My apartment is on the second...

1861
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:03,410
Second, second floor.

1862
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:04,810
That's right.

1863
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:05,890
Let's call just in case.

1864
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:06,670
7, 3, 3, 2.

1865
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:11,890
7, 3, 3, 2.

1866
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:19,690
12 hours.

1867
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:20,510
12 hours waiting, Stream.

1868
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:21,230
Yeah.

1869
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:24,550
I'll do like...

1870
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:31,150
We'll just have it on in the background and we can be like, okay.

1871
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:33,050
No ID?

1872
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:33,970
No he has an ID.

1873
01:24:35,210 --> 01:24:36,790
He seems good I think.

1874
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:42,350
It seems...

1875
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:45,130
Like at the end of streams, we'll be like, where are aliens?

1876
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:48,510
No date.

1877
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:51,390
You're right!

1878
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:53,050
Oh my gosh, wait.

1879
01:24:54,990 --> 01:24:56,190
Things are not in order?

1880
01:24:57,890 --> 01:24:58,330
Things?

1881
01:24:58,330 --> 01:24:59,210
Let me checklist.

1882
01:24:59,810 --> 01:25:00,410
Uh oh.

1883
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:02,290
Uh oh.

1884
01:25:04,090 --> 01:25:05,810
Well let me click the checklist again.

1885
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:11,490
Is it because I already gave the okay?

1886
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:18,980
You can still call?

1887
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,060
Sorry if you were innocent.

1888
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:24,360
Sorry.

1889
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:27,220
Sorry if you were innocent, man.

1890
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,480
But I don't think you were.

1891
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:30,400
I think you had a fraudulent ID.

1892
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:35,400
I think you're a doppelganger.

1893
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:36,740
You're about to get exterminated.

1894
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:40,160
They're about to come in and literally set you on fire.

1895
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,020
He was sus.

1896
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:57,640
Uh oh.

1897
01:25:58,960 --> 01:25:59,340
Uh oh.

1898
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,160
Jabba's a reporter.

1899
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:05,420
No!

1900
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:05,980
What?

1901
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:06,700
There it is!

1902
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,040
4, 5, 6.

1903
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:11,680
You guys saved me before too.

1904
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:12,840
I was so close.

1905
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:16,840
9, 8, 5, 5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9.

1906
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,880
I was two seconds away from letting him in, you guys.

1907
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:20,800
I was two seconds away.

1908
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,740
The building I've come from my job is a reporter.

1909
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:31,380
Good job, team.

1910
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:40,580
Can you imagine this guy walking up to his apartment and seeing a doppelganger of himself being dragged out?

1911
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:47,260
I think I would tip the door, man.

1912
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,260
I'd be like, good job!

1913
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:49,700
Good job, man.

1914
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:51,780
Siege, thanks for the five gifted.

1915
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:52,480
Thank you!

1916
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:56,560
That would ruin my life.

1917
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:58,940
No, I'd be like, good job, doorman.

1918
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,640
You're doing a good job.

1919
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:03,300
Wait, so yeah, he's not there.

1920
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:07,700
Because we already called before.

1921
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:10,900
Yeah.

1922
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:12,660
Good job, team.

1923
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:15,140
Oh, it's James.

1924
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:18,740
Steven.

1925
01:27:26,770 --> 01:27:28,030
Where do you live?

1926
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:29,010
Where do you live?

1927
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:29,490
Where do you live?

1928
01:27:29,490 --> 01:27:29,790
303.

1929
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,680
Oh, gosh.

1930
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:39,700
Big nose.

1931
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:41,480
Yup.

1932
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,420
Yup, wear sunglasses.

1933
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:45,520
Short hair.

1934
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:48,220
Small hair.

1935
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:56,100
Ori, thank you for the 10 gifted.

1936
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:56,560
Thank you!

1937
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:01,100
565845.

1938
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,160
565845.

1939
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:05,540
455965.

1940
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:06,060
Yep.

1941
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:07,660
Steven Red Boys.

1942
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,440
And I know he's on the list.

1943
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,440
Let's call up his place of residence.

1944
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:13,600
4242.

1945
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:15,740
4242.

1946
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:17,580
4242.

1947
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:21,660
Hey,

1948
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:24,920
now.

1949
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:26,140
I have a huge head.

1950
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,100
You say that, Steve.

1951
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:29,480
You say that.

1952
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:30,980
My son is not at home.

1953
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:32,840
Is he back?

1954
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:33,940
I think so.

1955
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:37,000
I don't know anymore after Mia.

1956
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:39,540
I have no idea anymore.

1957
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:46,100
I'm gonna check his appearance one last time.

1958
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:53,920
Yeah.

1959
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:54,580
Okay.

1960
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:58,400
42?

1961
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,440
Nose?

1962
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,300
What do you mean, nose?

1963
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:03,580
His nose is fine.

1964
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:07,920
Oopsie.

1965
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:13,060
I was not better than that guy at the beginning.

1966
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:14,900
Six doppelgangers.

1967
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:14,920
Six doppelgangers.

1968
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:17,860
Ah.

1969
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:19,220
Wait.

1970
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:20,640
What do you mean neighbors killed zero?

1971
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,660
Mia, fake documents.

1972
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:33,300
Ah.

1973
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:34,580
Where's Mia?

1974
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:37,960
Which one, though?

1975
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:40,360
Which one?

1976
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:41,500
Which one?

1977
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:47,880
Now aim for an F.

1978
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:50,080
Actually, I do want to go to the menu.

1979
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:52,120
Because, um...

1980
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:54,080
Record?

1981
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:54,780
Is that...

1982
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:57,540
Oh, here we go.

1983
01:29:58,620 --> 01:29:59,060
Achievements?

1984
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:01,580
Oh, wow.

1985
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:02,380
You can get...

1986
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:02,820
Wow.

1987
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,120
B, C, D, E, F.

1988
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:05,460
Wow.

1989
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:06,900
Achievements.

1990
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:08,280
Oh, look at that.

1991
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:09,220
Meet the clown.

1992
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:11,120
Discover the secret of the universe.

1993
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:13,140
Finish one playthrough alive.

1994
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:14,660
Be murdered.

1995
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:17,440

1996
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,060

Kill one neighbor.

1998
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:23,960
Kill one neighbor.

1999
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,040
Wait, how do I kill a neighbor?

2000
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:29,580
Since you told me you read my letter, I can't stop wondering what you thought about it.

2001
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:29,660
Since you told me you read my letter, I can't stop wondering what you thought about it.

2002
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:30,800
I hope I wasn't too embarrassing.

2003
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:31,400
No!

2004
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:32,660
It was so nice!

2005
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:34,600
Thank you.

2006
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:37,780
Yeah, it was so nice.

2007
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,000
Oh!

2008
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,560
Call DDD on someone innocent.

2009
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:44,080
Got it.

01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:46,620
Capture a hundred doppelgangers.

2011
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:48,720
Capture a hundred doppelgangers.

2012
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:49,560
Complete any folder?

2013
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:50,840
That's not possible.

2014
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,160
Complete Chester's quiz.

2015
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:55,200

Meet the peach doppelganger.

2020
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,980
Catch a doppelganger red-handed.

2021
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:14,940
What?

2022
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:17,840
Complete 100 playthroughs.

2023
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:19,100
What's the peach?

2024
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:20,300
Wait, did we not...

2025
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:21,220
Peaches peaches.

2026
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:23,600
Do we not meet the peach doppelganger?

2027
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,400
Do we get the doppelganger of the peach bros?

2028
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:29,740
Hmmm...

2029
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:32,580
Peaches peaches peaches.

2030
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:33,740
Peaches peaches peaches.

2031
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:35,640
Peaches peaches peaches decides!

2032
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:38,980
I love you!

2033
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:41,120
Ad greaterfrage!

2034
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:41,220
Oh oh.

2035
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:49,560
It sure would be something to 100% this game.

2036
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:50,520
I know, right?

2037
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:57,240
I think this one, Steal Memory, that is not my... that is not...

2038
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,640
That is rough for me.

2039
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:12,840
Like, capture a hop... hopple... capture 100 doppelgangers is doable.

2040
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,440
You just have to play the game a lot.

2041
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,640
I mean, we are already at 12, so...

2042
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,920
And... 40 playthroughs.

2043
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:26,480
I think you can get both of these, you know?

2044
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:30,890
Let's try again.

2045
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:31,990
Oh, let's try again.

2046
01:32:32,010 --> 01:32:33,490
At least get like the peach one.

2047
01:32:33,650 --> 01:32:37,250
And whatever the quiz is, I do... I'm curious about that.

2048
01:32:37,790 --> 01:32:41,830
The ones that are like the special doppelgangers, I'm most curious about.

2049
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:48,350
And then, I guess they'll be adding more modes in the future.

2050
01:32:48,570 --> 01:32:49,210
That'll be fun.

2051
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:50,990
Unless you unlock them when you get more achievements.

2052
01:32:51,890 --> 01:32:52,730
That'll be fun, though.

2053
01:32:54,270 --> 01:32:54,710
Ian!

2054
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:55,410
Vivian!

2055
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:56,530
Welcome to Bamboo Ship.

2056
01:32:56,590 --> 01:32:57,130
Thank you, bro!

2057
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:57,850
Thank you!

2058
01:32:58,910 --> 01:33:00,830
A hopple dundridgangers.

2059
01:33:02,670 --> 01:33:03,110
Yeah.

2060
01:33:04,170 --> 01:33:05,210
Oh, we can skip this.

2061
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:12,580
Hello!

2062
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:13,020
Skip!

2063
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:14,500
See ya!

2064
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:17,520
See ya!

2065
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:18,140
See ya!

2066
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:21,060
Are we doing... this time?

2067
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:23,160
Let's get an F.

2068
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:24,240
Hello.

2069
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:32,340
We have to... to get an F, since it was the lowest and there were so many in between, we probably have to get every single one incorrect.

2070
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:36,680
Whoa!

2071
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:38,000
Wee!

2072
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,100
Full day!

2073
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:40,660
Wow!

2074
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:42,560
Which one is you?

2075
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:43,620
Selene.

2076
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:51,240
Every night in my dreams, I see you.

2077
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:54,080
I feel you.

2078
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,280
Selene has it on the right side.

2079
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:00,360
Pointed nose.

2080
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:01,120
Yeah.

2081
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:02,580
Slim.

2082
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:03,200
Slim.

2083
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:04,320
Maybe.

2084
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:05,280
I don't know.

2085
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:05,700
I guess.

2086
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,340
Long neck.

2087
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:09,380
Short.

2088
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:10,960
Twin.

2089
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:15,560
So, if this is correct, that means we call the cops on her.

2090
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:18,760
Both have logos.

2091
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:22,540
So, seven, eight, five.

2092
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:25,280
Six, one, three.

2093
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:27,320
Two, six, nine.

2094
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:29,080
Five, one, four.

2095
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:32,480
I think we need to call the cops on Selene Dion.

2096
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,000
Oh, call the house.

2097
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:37,580
Yes.

2098
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:40,460
Let's call the house.

2099
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:41,880
Six, nine, nine, six.

2100
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:48,740
Six, nine, nine, six.

2101
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,180
Genocide run.

2102
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:53,660
Yup.

2103
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:55,100
Yup.

2104
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:57,780
So, this time we are going for all inaccurate.

2105
01:34:58,720 --> 01:34:59,600
No one's home.

2106
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,160
Get her out of here.

2107
01:35:09,310 --> 01:35:13,450
You will not survive here.

2108
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:19,010
You will not ever see your family again.

2109
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:25,590
Thank you.

2110
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:34,460
Let's hope we get some obvious doppelgangers in here.

2111
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:37,820
I like Roman.

2112
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:38,060
Roman.

2113
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,560
We haven't seen you in a while.

2114
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,920
I hope you're a doppelganger so I don't have to kill you.

2115
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:48,600
One, one.

2116
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:52,760
Yeah, you got that.

2117
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:53,940
Lucky, lucky.

2118
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:55,040
You're a lucky man.

2119
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:55,580
You know that?

2120
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,140
You're a lucky, lucky man.

2121
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:02,020
Mr. Roman Stilnski.

2122
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:04,240
Big nose.

2123
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:04,980
Yeah.

2124
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,000
Scar on right chin.

2125
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:07,560
Yeah.

2126
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:08,860
Long face.

2127
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:09,560
Yeah.

2128
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:11,400
One eyebrow.

2129
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:12,160
Yeah.

2130
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:14,640
Where's a hat?

2131
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:16,960
You can't be correct.

2132
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:19,460
He has an expiration date.

2133
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:26,000
483-924-059-684.

2134
01:36:26,660 --> 01:36:27,500
No!

2135
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:29,700
No!

2136
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:30,620
No!

2137
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:31,540
No!

2138
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:33,460
Oh wait, is he on a list?

2139
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:36,360
Let's call his house.

2140
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,060
1-1-5-2.

2141
01:36:45,570 --> 01:36:46,210
Let's check.

2142
01:36:47,790 --> 01:36:48,550
Let's check.

2143
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:50,150
It's a villager.

2144
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:52,070
Huh.

2145
01:36:53,690 --> 01:36:55,150
Louis Stilnski speaking.

2146
01:36:57,650 --> 01:36:58,130
No.

2147
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:09,930
I'm not on today's list because I had to leave due to an emergency at work.

2148
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:10,730
You're an accountant.

2149
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:12,450
What kind of an emergency would there be?

2150
01:37:12,450 --> 01:37:12,530
Wee!

2151
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:15,890
Hmm.

2152
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:24,710
07.

2153
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:25,930
Mr. Roman.

2154
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:28,870
The numbers were wrong?

2155
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:30,350
No they weren't.

2156
01:37:31,190 --> 01:37:31,970
They were?

2157
01:37:33,910 --> 01:37:39,330
483-924-059-684.

2158
01:37:41,110 --> 01:37:41,690
They're all right.

2159
01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:43,390
Oh!

2160
01:37:43,390 --> 01:37:46,670
Oh, you mean the numbers in the account...

2161
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:52,070
You mean there was an accounting error.

2162
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:55,590
Not an error from me.

2163
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:56,990
Oh, man.

2164
01:37:59,850 --> 01:38:00,490
07.

2165
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:09,020
Have your doppelganger come back.

2166
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,020
Emergency accounting.

2167
01:38:11,380 --> 01:38:11,760
Hey, Su!

2168
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:17,640
I've contacted the day-day-day.

2169
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:18,880
See you later.

2170
01:38:21,940 --> 01:38:22,680
See you later.

2171
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:26,940
There was an emergency he didn't account for.

2172
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:36,780
Good afternoon, Gloria.

2173
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:38,320
Gloria.

2174
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,000
Round face.

2175
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:43,480
Mole on the right cheek.

2176
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:45,840
Short hair.

2177
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:47,620
Round nose.

2178
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:49,660
You're looking perfect today, Gloria.

2179
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,340
I might have to call the cops on you.

2180
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:54,640
Job is a banker.

2181
01:38:55,580 --> 01:38:58,540
I work at the bank.

2182
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:02,320
Umm...

2183
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,160
Can their names be written wrong and stuff?

2184
01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:07,420
I wonder how small the details go into, you know?

2185
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,660
He didn't really...

2186
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:11,920
...excel today.

2187
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:19,920
Ohhhh...

2188
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:23,460
He didn't calculate how poor I am.

2189
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:26,940
Or... this would be... for him!

2190
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:34,450
Boo!

2191
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:36,890
Thank you guys!

2192
01:39:37,010 --> 01:39:37,290
Thank you!

2193
01:39:37,450 --> 01:39:38,210
I knew you'd love it!

2194
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:38,450
Boo!

2195
01:39:38,710 --> 01:39:39,030
Boo!

2196
01:39:39,170 --> 01:39:39,530
Yes!

2197
01:39:39,610 --> 01:39:39,830
Yes!

2198
01:39:40,010 --> 01:39:40,450
Boo!

2199
01:39:40,810 --> 01:39:41,250
Boo!

2200
01:39:41,610 --> 01:39:42,050
Yes!

2201
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:42,750
Yes!

2202
01:39:43,270 --> 01:39:43,930
Thank you.

2203
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:45,070
I knew you guys would love it.

2204
01:39:47,130 --> 01:40:00,270
6-9-8-5-2-2 3-4-1 1-5-0 I have to make an O emote to go with the B.

2205
01:40:01,890 --> 01:40:03,230
I do, I do, I do.

2206
01:40:03,310 --> 01:40:04,950
5-1-2-3

2207
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:12,100
Let's see...

2208
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:19,630
Hello, Arnold Schmidt speaking.

2209
01:40:21,430 --> 01:40:22,670
My wife is not at home.

2210
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:25,630
Is she back?

2211
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:28,710
Oh, she's back, alright.

2212
01:40:30,030 --> 01:40:33,210
Oh, she's back, alright.

2213
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:35,570
Back...

2214
01:40:41,490 --> 01:40:42,070
She's...

2215
01:40:44,450 --> 01:40:45,780
Back to jail!

2216
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:03,720
She's back to...

2217
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:09,600
Back to being a baby!

2218
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:12,900
In...

2219
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,340
In the tummy!

2220
01:41:15,430 --> 01:41:16,820
It's like she was never born!

2221
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:18,820
Yet...

2222
01:41:19,430 --> 01:41:20,640
Or ever again.

2223
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:24,940
Hello.

2224
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:27,020
Can I have your ID, please?

2225
01:41:27,860 --> 01:41:28,700
Thank you.

2226
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:30,980
Mr. Robertski.

2227
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:32,520
Are you on the list?

2228
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:35,140
You are.

2229
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:37,480
Uh-oh.

2230
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:37,940
Wait.

2231
01:41:38,940 --> 01:41:39,720
Uh-oh.

2232
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:40,700
The game is glitching.

2233
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:41,140
It's glitching again.

2234
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:43,760
It won't let me click on his file.

2235
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,340
Shoemaker, we know that.

2236
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,380
I don't know what his phone number is.

2237
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:02,880
Hold on.

2238
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:09,000
I think it's 2-6-6-8.

2239
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:10,200
Oh, whoops.

2240
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:11,480
Gotta trust you.

2241
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:15,740
2-6-6-8.

2242
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:17,300
Oh!

2243
01:42:25,490 --> 01:42:26,350
You were right!

2244
01:42:26,490 --> 01:42:27,350
Wait, Robertski.

2245
01:42:27,770 --> 01:42:29,070
My brother is not at home.

2246
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:35,690
Yeah, cause he's Robertski and he's Albertski.

2247
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:37,270
Peachman, Peachman.

2248
01:42:38,330 --> 01:42:39,590
Yes, thank you.

2249
01:42:39,690 --> 01:42:39,950
Okay.

2250
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:42,110
So we knew he was out.

2251
01:42:42,350 --> 01:42:43,510
We have the DDD.

2252
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:45,130
We got the expiration date.

2253
01:42:45,230 --> 01:42:45,770
It's good.

2254
01:42:46,790 --> 01:42:47,270
Uh...

2255
01:42:47,270 --> 01:42:49,570
His appearance looks fine to me.

2256
01:42:50,070 --> 01:42:50,870
I don't...

2257
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:51,610
I can't...

2258
01:42:51,610 --> 01:42:52,750
I think I remember what he looks like.

2259
01:42:52,770 --> 01:42:53,330
We know he's a baby.

2260
01:42:53,330 --> 01:42:53,790
He's a shoemaker.

2261
01:42:55,830 --> 01:42:57,610
Get out of here, Peachman.

2262
01:42:58,610 --> 01:43:00,450
Can I undo this once I...

2263
01:43:00,450 --> 01:43:01,070
Oh, I can.

2264
01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:02,370
Okay, that's kinda nice.

2265
01:43:04,430 --> 01:43:05,230
Just kidding.

2266
01:43:07,570 --> 01:43:10,050
This guy is just like, No, please don't kill me!

2267
01:43:10,110 --> 01:43:10,270
No!

2268
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:11,290
No, God!

2269
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:12,570
Oh, God, please!

2270
01:43:12,790 --> 01:43:14,570
I'm just kidding, Robertski.

2271
01:43:16,430 --> 01:43:17,290
I'm not kidding.

2272
01:43:18,450 --> 01:43:19,650
Death to you!

2273
01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:20,710
Death to you!

2274
01:43:21,030 --> 01:43:22,470
Death to you, Peachman!

2275
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:23,470
And he's behind there.

2276
01:43:23,510 --> 01:43:24,430
He's like, No, please!

2277
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:25,710
Oh, God!

2278
01:43:26,050 --> 01:43:26,810
Sperrys, please!

2279
01:43:27,190 --> 01:43:28,270
Oh, Sperry!

2280
01:43:29,010 --> 01:43:30,210
I'm just kidding.

2281
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:31,310
I'm just...

2282
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:33,490
Oh, my gosh.

2283
01:43:33,510 --> 01:43:35,850
It's just a prank, bro!

2284
01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:37,470
It's just a pr...

2285
01:43:37,470 --> 01:43:37,930
Oh, no.

2286
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:38,350
Never mind.

2287
01:43:44,530 --> 01:43:45,970
Off with his head!

2288
01:43:48,450 --> 01:43:51,490
Do you get anything for making more ghosts?

2289
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:52,870
Like commission?

2290
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:54,750
Unfortunately, no.

2291
01:43:54,810 --> 01:43:55,250
Oh, my God.

2292
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:56,310
Oh, my God.

2293
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:59,710
Actually, the afterlife is kind of crowded.

2294
01:44:00,670 --> 01:44:02,330
I don't think they want more ghosts.

2295
01:44:08,050 --> 01:44:09,010
All righty.

2296
01:44:09,630 --> 01:44:10,710
Next person, please.

2297
01:44:12,190 --> 01:44:12,670
Hello.

2298
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:17,110
I think we killed your sister earlier.

2299
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:23,590
Oh, my gosh.

2300
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:25,890
Wait, we can't click the first floor anymore at all?

2301
01:44:25,890 --> 01:44:28,310
Oh, the game is so bugged.

2302
01:44:31,050 --> 01:44:31,530
Nice.

2303
01:44:37,950 --> 01:44:42,130
Does anyone know her... her phone number?

2304
01:44:43,090 --> 01:44:44,950
She might actually be a doppelganger.

2305
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:45,530
I don't know.

2306
01:44:45,590 --> 01:44:46,110
I can't tell.

2307
01:44:48,110 --> 01:44:51,330
I don't remember which side the mall is supposed to be on.

2308
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:52,570
No job.

2309
01:44:54,070 --> 01:44:55,190
She's a model.

2310
01:44:55,350 --> 01:44:55,870
I remember that.

2311
01:44:55,890 --> 01:44:57,070
ViviCore, thanks for the gift.

2312
01:44:58,650 --> 01:44:59,530
It's 3312.

2313
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:00,230
Thank you.

2314
01:45:03,370 --> 01:45:05,010
Thank you, guys, for helping.

2315
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:11,240
She's on the list.

2316
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:16,280
You guys tricked me.

2317
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:21,720
Hi!

2318
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,460
Oh, her picture would be on the list.

2319
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:31,160
You're so right.

2320
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:32,440
Oh, wait.

2321
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:33,220
It looks just like...

2322
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:33,620
I don't like her.

2323
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:37,180
Yeah, Illinois.

2324
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:42,260
6996!

2325
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:43,440
How could I forget?

2326
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:50,860
Thanks, 6J and Kyoma.

2327
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:55,220
Thank you.

2328
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:58,340
They're not there?

2329
01:45:58,500 --> 01:45:58,680
Wait.

2330
01:45:58,900 --> 01:45:59,600
Oh, wait.

2331
01:45:59,680 --> 01:45:59,960
No.

2332
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:01,380
Because I killed the sister before.

2333
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:02,700
It would make sense that...

2334
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:03,900
Nobody's home.

2335
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:05,520
Right?

2336
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:08,580
And her little ahoge is going in the right direction.

2337
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:11,580
Did he just make these characters and flip them?

2338
01:46:16,110 --> 01:46:18,290
I put 69, 69!

2339
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:20,050
Nine!

2340
01:46:24,350 --> 01:46:24,990
Six!

2341
01:46:28,630 --> 01:46:30,290
Oh, my god.

2342
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:33,830
Oh, I need to sleep properly tonight for real.

2343
01:46:33,950 --> 01:46:35,390
I'm gonna have trouble tomorrow.

2344
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:36,890
Okay, it's the same reaction though.

2345
01:46:40,050 --> 01:46:42,070
I think I'm just gonna have to kill her.

2346
01:46:49,310 --> 01:46:51,570
Let the sisters be together.

2347
01:46:51,710 --> 01:46:52,910
Exactly, exactly.

2348
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:00,570
Thank you!

2349
01:47:01,330 --> 01:47:02,690
Oh, he's still talking.

2350
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:04,490
I need some more tea.

2351
01:47:07,950 --> 01:47:08,670
Bye bye.

2352
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:10,970
See you later.

2353
01:47:10,970 --> 01:47:11,050
See you later.

2354
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:14,150
Next person, please!

2355
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:20,260
Good afternoon.

2356
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:21,940
Where is your entry request?

2357
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:24,460
I'm already sussy of you.

2358
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:25,460
Mia Stone.

2359
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:27,480
I think she is on the list.

2360
01:47:27,580 --> 01:47:27,740
Yeah.

2361
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:28,620
301.

2362
01:47:33,260 --> 01:47:34,800
Looks the same.

2363
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:36,200
Let's count the freckles.

2364
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:42,340
Yep.

2365
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:44,260
Thin eyebrows.

2366
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:46,980
Oval face.

2367
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,360
She's a teacher.

2368
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:51,380
Indeed she is.

2369
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:52,660
Emma Stone.

2370
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:03,180
Let's call 1425.

2371
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:07,640
1425.

2372
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:14,000
You know what annoys me even more about those who got me with the 3312 being the twins' number?

2373
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:21,980
The fact that I so sincerely thanked you guys for for for helping me.

2374
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:23,660
I was just like, oh my gosh, thank you guys.

2375
01:48:23,740 --> 01:48:26,440
Because the game is glitching for me, I can't check myself.

2376
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:28,660
You guys are so awesome for helping me out.

2377
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:39,160
I so sincerely thanked you being like my you know wisps are so great.

2378
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:40,900
They're so helpful and kind.

2379
01:48:41,380 --> 01:48:43,260
You know Gliss, I don't want to see that.

2380
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:44,920
I don't want to see that from you.

2381
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:49,600
One guide hard?

2382
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:50,820
It was two people!

2383
01:48:51,820 --> 01:48:53,540
It was two of them.

2384
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:54,820
I got two guides.

2385
01:48:57,020 --> 01:48:57,760
Let's see.

2386
01:48:57,820 --> 01:48:58,800
Appearance seems fine.

2387
01:48:58,960 --> 01:48:59,420
ID?

2388
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:12,240
789564 789564 525115 525115 Mia Stone.

2389
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:14,900
I hope you said some lovely things to your friends.

2390
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:15,640
Hello, I'm your husband, tonight.

2391
01:49:15,860 --> 01:49:17,500
I mean last night, I mean this morning.

2392
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:19,680
What is wrong with me?

2393
01:49:25,670 --> 01:49:26,630
Anyway, okay.

2394
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:27,150
You know what?

2395
01:49:27,230 --> 01:49:29,250
Let's just send her away.

2396
01:49:35,530 --> 01:49:37,510
Let's just get her out of here.

2397
01:49:40,350 --> 01:49:41,430
Let's just get her out of here.

2398
01:49:41,430 --> 01:49:42,630
Low on brain juice.

2399
01:49:49,530 --> 01:49:50,970
Oh my gosh.

2400
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:13,370
Do your ears hang low?

2401
01:50:13,590 --> 01:50:15,270
Do they wobble to and fro?

2402
01:50:15,450 --> 01:50:17,370
Can you tie them in a knot?

2403
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:19,110
Can you tie them in a bow?

2404
01:50:19,290 --> 01:50:20,810
Can you throw them over...

2405
01:50:22,370 --> 01:50:24,150
Can you hand this to me, Francis?

2406
01:50:25,130 --> 01:50:27,170
What happened to your ears?

2407
01:50:29,250 --> 01:50:30,430
My ears?

2408
01:50:32,550 --> 01:50:34,990
I spread them out to here better.

2409
01:50:36,490 --> 01:50:37,830
Makes sense to me.

2410
01:50:39,030 --> 01:50:40,570
Have a nice day, Francis.

2411
01:50:43,230 --> 01:50:45,570
Can you throw them over your shoulder?

2412
01:50:46,170 --> 01:50:47,850
Like a something, some...

2413
01:50:50,050 --> 01:50:50,730
Hello.

2414
01:50:55,290 --> 01:50:56,070
Uh-oh.

2415
01:50:59,630 --> 01:51:00,370
Uh-oh.

2416
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:10,370
Oh, we can tie it!

2417
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:11,370
We can click it again!

2418
01:51:11,450 --> 01:51:11,830
Nice!

2419
01:51:13,870 --> 01:51:16,430
Celine is right... or left side.

2420
01:51:20,420 --> 01:51:21,340
She escaped.

2421
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:25,000
Oh no, she's a perfect...

2422
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:35,870
The third lost child.

2423
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:38,730
The mole on entry is wrong?

2424
01:51:38,910 --> 01:51:39,390
What do you mean?

2425
01:51:44,750 --> 01:51:46,110
No, it's correct.

2426
01:51:46,890 --> 01:51:47,330
She's Celine.

2427
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:56,470
Her name is spelled wrong.

2428
01:51:57,970 --> 01:51:59,170
No, it's not.

2429
01:52:01,010 --> 01:52:01,990
It's correct.

2430
01:52:04,430 --> 01:52:07,470
How am I supposed to know which one was the right...

2431
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:07,630
Okay.

2432
01:52:08,150 --> 01:52:08,750
Okay.

2433
01:52:08,770 --> 01:52:10,990
I'm going to make an educated guess here.

2434
01:52:11,870 --> 01:52:12,470
What?

2435
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:13,330
It's missing an S.

2436
01:52:15,230 --> 01:52:17,310
Oh, her last name!

2437
01:52:24,230 --> 01:52:25,490
Sivert... Sivert... Oh!

2438
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:30,190
My ID?

2439
01:52:33,590 --> 01:52:35,590
I don't see anything wrong with my ID.

2440
01:52:36,530 --> 01:52:37,330
Well, okay.

2441
01:52:37,390 --> 01:52:39,290
This was going to be my educated guess anyway.

2442
01:52:39,590 --> 01:52:42,870
This was going to be my educated guess that she was the doppelganger anyway.

2443
01:52:43,010 --> 01:52:43,550
Because...

2444
01:52:44,190 --> 01:52:48,830
Say we let the first two in because they were correct.

2445
01:52:48,830 --> 01:52:49,470
They were correct.

2446
01:52:49,990 --> 01:52:52,130
Even if she was so perfect...

2447
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:54,430
Well...

2448
01:52:55,210 --> 01:52:57,490
It would have had to been the doppelganger.

2449
01:52:57,930 --> 01:52:58,490
You know?

2450
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:01,690
Anyway...

2451
01:53:03,190 --> 01:53:03,870
Bye-bye!

2452
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:31,220
Bye-bye!

2453
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:32,620
Bye-bye!

2454
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:33,540
Bye-bye!

2455
01:53:33,620 --> 01:53:34,120
Bye-bye!

2456
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:37,480
Hmm...

2457
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:39,720
I don't...

2458
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:41,020
Oh, she is on the list!

2459
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:42,760
That's why she went outside.

2460
01:53:43,180 --> 01:53:44,280
Because she was on the list.

2461
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:45,560
Have a nice day!

2462
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:46,500
Have a nice day!

2463
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:53,060
Oh, no!

2464
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:53,680
She is French!

2465
01:53:58,580 --> 01:53:59,380
Good afternoon.

2466
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:03,160
Good afternoon, Angus.

2467
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:06,240
Well, okay.

2468
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:06,800
You know what?

2469
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,400
I did ask earlier, I think, if the names could be misspelled.

2470
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:12,220
And that answers my question, doesn't it?

2471
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:13,000
The person before.

2472
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,740
Average mint enjoyer.

2473
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:15,980
What do you mean by that?

2474
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:18,540
What do you mean by that?

2475
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:21,500
103.

2476
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:24,160
Long neck.

2477
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,160
Wears a hat.

2478
01:54:29,710 --> 01:54:32,100
Has a mustache and small eyes.

2479
01:54:34,770 --> 01:54:35,940
He is a businessman.

2480
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:38,160
565...

2481
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:39,740
003...

2482
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:40,800
6...

2483
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:41,420
9...

2484
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:41,740
8...

2485
01:54:41,740 --> 01:54:41,980
8...

2486
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:42,500
4...

2487
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:43,080
5...

2488
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:44,580
Looks good to me!

2489
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:46,980
Except...

2490
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:50,420
Except...

2491
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:52,100
Oh, sir.

2492
01:54:52,940 --> 01:54:54,080
Oh, no, sir.

2493
01:54:54,140 --> 01:54:56,120
You are quite suspicious.

2494
01:54:57,660 --> 01:54:59,540
If I do say so myself.

2495
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:01,180
But, I will call your home.

2496
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:02,900
And see.

2497
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:04,200
5513.

2498
01:55:10,590 --> 01:55:11,630
Mm-hmm.

2499
01:55:17,110 --> 01:55:19,130
Oh, I thought someone picked up for a second!

2500
01:55:23,990 --> 01:55:25,870
I wouldn't trust anyone with that smile.

2501
01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:29,530
Look, you can't judge a book by its cover, okay?

2502
01:55:30,330 --> 01:55:31,590
This guy, he's just...

2503
01:55:31,590 --> 01:55:34,070
He's just Angus Kipriani.

2504
01:55:36,270 --> 01:55:37,630
Wait, what floor was it?

2505
01:55:37,710 --> 01:55:38,110
Oh, first floor.

2506
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:40,630
Angus Kipriani.

2507
01:55:42,570 --> 01:55:47,230
You are under arrest for tax evasion!

2508
01:55:51,470 --> 01:55:53,110
So far, I think we're doing pretty well.

2509
01:55:54,890 --> 01:55:56,350
I think we're doing well, you guys.

2510
01:55:56,410 --> 01:55:57,810
I think we're gonna get this F for sure.

2511
01:56:00,910 --> 01:56:02,390
I think we're gonna get it for sure.

2512
01:56:06,690 --> 01:56:08,350
You can continue your job.

2513
01:56:10,110 --> 01:56:11,150
Thank you!

2514
01:56:13,030 --> 01:56:14,070
Thank you!

2515
01:56:15,090 --> 01:56:15,610
Thank you!

2516
01:56:15,610 --> 01:56:15,950
Here, boss.

2517
01:56:16,070 --> 01:56:22,350
I'm taking responsibility for accidentally gaslighting you with the accountant's numbers-related emergency.

2518
01:56:22,610 --> 01:56:22,870
No!

2519
01:56:24,170 --> 01:56:28,610
I hope you can get some well-deserved rest after this stream is over and have a great weekend.

2520
01:56:28,810 --> 01:56:29,350
You too!

2521
01:56:29,570 --> 01:56:30,510
Thank you!

2522
01:56:30,550 --> 01:56:31,570
Thank you so much.

2523
01:56:32,130 --> 01:56:32,810
Thank you.

2524
01:56:32,850 --> 01:56:33,310
Thank you.

2525
01:56:34,110 --> 01:56:35,530
We got Francis back.

2526
01:56:36,510 --> 01:56:37,730
He's a milkman.

2527
01:56:37,870 --> 01:56:38,330
Thank you.

2528
01:56:39,650 --> 01:56:41,590
He's on the list.

2529
01:56:43,290 --> 01:56:43,910
Heretic!

2530
01:56:43,910 --> 01:56:44,770
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

2531
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:45,750
Thank you so much!

2532
01:56:46,270 --> 01:56:46,650
Thank you!

2533
01:56:46,670 --> 01:56:46,930
Thank you!

2534
01:56:46,930 --> 01:56:47,170
Thank you!

2535
01:56:47,810 --> 01:56:51,970
Alright, let's check your... your... numbers.

2536
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:54,050
2355.

2537
01:56:54,890 --> 01:56:55,510
2355.

2538
01:56:56,190 --> 01:56:56,810
6941.

2539
01:56:58,310 --> 01:56:58,930
6941.

2540
01:56:59,770 --> 01:57:00,390
8995!

2541
01:57:01,490 --> 01:57:03,390
His expiration date is good!

2542
01:57:03,870 --> 01:57:05,550
He's a DDD.

2543
01:57:05,810 --> 01:57:06,390
DDD!

2544
01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:06,710
DDD!

2545
01:57:06,830 --> 01:57:07,450
DDD!

2546
01:57:07,450 --> 01:57:07,470
DDD!

2547
01:57:07,690 --> 01:57:08,310
DDD!

2548
01:57:09,510 --> 01:57:11,990
I just let you in earlier, actually, Francis.

2549
01:57:12,230 --> 01:57:14,790
So, um... what are you doing back here?

2550
01:57:15,250 --> 01:57:15,710
Hmm?

2551
01:57:16,250 --> 01:57:17,690
I just let you in.

2552
01:57:17,730 --> 01:57:23,670
Let's make sure, like, the nose and stuff, though, because some of these tinier details could probably get us tripped up.

2553
01:57:23,770 --> 01:57:25,870
We think that they're fine, but they're actually not.

2554
01:57:30,210 --> 01:57:31,610
I think with this one, we're good.

2555
01:57:32,830 --> 01:57:34,550
I am 100% not baked.

2556
01:57:34,570 --> 01:57:36,190
I saw this Zipper chat.

2557
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:37,210
Ah!

2558
01:57:37,830 --> 01:57:38,290
Oh!

2559
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:52,640
Cleaning protocol completed.

2560
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:55,740
Continue your job.

2561
01:57:56,660 --> 01:57:57,560
Yes, sir.

2562
01:57:57,720 --> 01:57:58,480
Thank you, sir.

2563
01:57:58,620 --> 01:57:59,660
See you later.

2564
01:58:00,860 --> 01:58:01,540
Sir...

2565
01:58:05,190 --> 01:58:06,450
Oh my gosh!

2566
01:58:07,130 --> 01:58:08,150
You're back!

2567
01:58:09,690 --> 01:58:10,370
Yes!

2568
01:58:10,810 --> 01:58:11,490
You!

2569
01:58:12,810 --> 01:58:14,110
Of course!

2570
01:58:14,150 --> 01:58:15,130
The mom.

2571
01:58:16,210 --> 01:58:16,890
Nacha!

2572
01:58:18,550 --> 01:58:19,230
Nacha!

2573
01:58:19,230 --> 01:58:21,770
How are you doing today, Nacha?

2574
01:58:21,770 --> 01:58:22,090
I'm good.

2575
01:58:22,110 --> 01:58:22,850
Oh.

2576
01:58:25,610 --> 01:58:26,550
I mean...

2577
01:58:28,350 --> 01:58:28,830
Yeah?

2578
01:58:30,290 --> 01:58:31,250
Nacha, I mean...

2579
01:58:31,250 --> 01:58:33,170
Usually, people just say, I'm fine.

2580
01:58:36,190 --> 01:58:38,650
No need to trauma dump on me or anything.

2581
01:58:38,790 --> 01:58:39,290
I get it.

2582
01:58:40,890 --> 01:58:41,370
Okay.

2583
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:42,450
All right.

2584
01:58:42,510 --> 01:58:43,450
Let's just let her in.

2585
01:58:43,510 --> 01:58:45,890
Let her have a... you know, get some rest, Nacha!

2586
01:58:46,830 --> 01:58:47,310
Those...

2587
01:58:47,310 --> 01:58:48,410
Those will heal eventually.

2588
01:58:48,590 --> 01:58:49,150
Don't worry.

2589
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:50,230
Okay.

2590
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:52,090
Okay.

2591
01:58:52,110 --> 01:58:53,690
Don't worry, Nacha.

2592
01:58:56,930 --> 01:58:57,250
Let's see.

2593
01:58:57,250 --> 01:58:57,650
Enough, 뿡 twitter.

2594
01:58:57,750 --> 01:58:58,390
Reptilian.

2595
01:59:00,510 --> 01:59:01,150
Capuccino.

2596
01:59:02,490 --> 01:59:05,030
I'm arisen in this building, I went out to visit my parents.

2597
01:59:05,410 --> 01:59:06,390
Where do you live?

2598
01:59:06,590 --> 01:59:07,230
304.

2599
01:59:08,650 --> 01:59:09,870
She's a housewife.

2600
01:59:10,350 --> 01:59:11,590
Long-face.

2601
01:59:12,590 --> 01:59:13,690
Big nose.

2602
01:59:13,810 --> 01:59:14,750
Straight hair.

2603
01:59:15,010 --> 01:59:15,870
Wears a headband.

2604
01:59:16,290 --> 01:59:16,970
Yeah, looks...

2605
01:59:16,970 --> 01:59:18,850
Looks pretty right to me.

2606
01:59:19,690 --> 01:59:20,990
Looks pretty good.

2607
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:22,590
She's on the list.

2608
01:59:47,690 --> 01:59:49,090
Didn't this lady show up earlier?

2609
01:59:49,350 --> 01:59:49,850
Did she?

2610
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:50,730
I can't remember.

2611
01:59:50,730 --> 01:59:52,930
The games are bleeding into each other.

2612
01:59:56,630 --> 01:59:59,750
I'm interested in what would happen if you call since you let her other in.

2613
02:00:00,430 --> 02:00:01,230
Let's try it.

2614
02:00:01,730 --> 02:00:02,350
Who is it?

2615
02:00:02,450 --> 02:00:03,490
One, three, four, six.

2616
02:00:05,350 --> 02:00:09,250
One, three, four, six.

2617
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:25,070
Yeah, see?

2618
02:00:25,250 --> 02:00:26,210
We just let her in.

2619
02:00:30,110 --> 02:00:31,290
Oh, she wasn't on the list.

2620
02:00:31,350 --> 02:00:33,210
For some reason I was confusing her with Nacha.

2621
02:00:33,270 --> 02:00:36,170
So I was like, wait, but you were on the list for real actually.

2622
02:00:39,050 --> 02:00:41,050
Hey Mintz, it's my friend Chris's birthday.

2623
02:00:41,890 --> 02:00:44,170
It would make him very happy if you could sing him happy birthday.

2624
02:00:44,290 --> 02:00:44,650
I can!

2625
02:00:45,030 --> 02:00:46,830
Also Simba, thank you for that birthday gift.

2626
02:00:46,890 --> 02:00:47,690
Thank you so much!

2627
02:00:50,930 --> 02:00:51,570
Happy birthday.

2628
02:00:53,570 --> 02:00:54,030
Hold on.

2629
02:00:55,950 --> 02:00:56,650
Okay, one more time.

2630
02:00:56,810 --> 02:00:56,990
One more time.

2631
02:00:58,410 --> 02:00:59,050
Happy birthday.

2632
02:00:59,590 --> 02:01:00,970
Happy birthday to you.

2633
02:01:01,350 --> 02:01:05,050
Happy birthday to you.

2634
02:01:05,150 --> 02:01:09,110
Happy birthday dear Chris.

2635
02:01:11,650 --> 02:01:18,730
Happy birthday to you.

2636
02:01:19,610 --> 02:01:21,010
Happy

2637
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:27,780
birthday.

2638
02:01:28,100 --> 02:01:30,120
This lady looks good, doesn't she?

2639
02:01:38,430 --> 02:01:40,350
Lots of...

2640
02:01:40,770 --> 02:01:42,510
Lots of humans today, eh?

2641
02:01:43,170 --> 02:01:44,430
Ugh, it's exhausting.

2642
02:01:45,190 --> 02:01:47,730
Really giving the DDD a run for their money.

2643
02:01:49,850 --> 02:01:50,410
Wait.

2644
02:01:51,730 --> 02:01:53,950
Hey Mintz, it's my friend Chris's birthday.

2645
02:01:55,570 --> 02:01:56,130
Huh?

2646
02:01:56,310 --> 02:01:59,150
It would make him very happy if you could sing him happy birthday.

2647
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:02,410
What?

2648
02:02:04,010 --> 02:02:06,150
It's definitely not the same Chris.

2649
02:02:08,690 --> 02:02:09,250
Huh?

2650
02:02:09,250 --> 02:02:09,290
Huh?

2651
02:02:10,010 --> 02:02:11,590
Can't you use the same one though?

2652
02:02:14,230 --> 02:02:14,710
What?

2653
02:02:15,990 --> 02:02:17,610
Yeah, is it a doppelganger Chris?

2654
02:02:19,890 --> 02:02:22,770
Does your Chris have a mole on his left side or his right side?

2655
02:02:24,630 --> 02:02:25,590
Hello Nacha!

2656
02:02:27,130 --> 02:02:30,270
Actually, I feel like we can automatically let this lady in.

2657
02:02:31,470 --> 02:02:36,150
Because we already called before and we saw that Nacha was at home.

2658
02:02:36,770 --> 02:02:37,470
You know?

2659
02:02:40,550 --> 02:02:41,590
Right eye blue.

2660
02:02:42,370 --> 02:02:43,270
Left eye green.

2661
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:48,100
No DDD.

2662
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:48,780
Oh, you're right.

2663
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:49,720
No DDD logo.

2664
02:02:50,680 --> 02:02:51,440
Let her in.

2665
02:02:53,700 --> 02:02:54,960
Yeah, we'll just let her in.

2666
02:02:58,500 --> 02:02:59,180
Wasn't bad!

2667
02:02:59,260 --> 02:03:00,380
Thank you for another 50!

2668
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:02,660
Thank you so much!

2669
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:03,280
Thank you!

2670
02:03:04,780 --> 02:03:05,740
Oh my goodness.

2671
02:03:05,740 --> 02:03:07,720
You guys have gotten insane with the...

2672
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:09,220
With the members.

2673
02:03:09,660 --> 02:03:10,460
Donos, everything.

2674
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:13,200
This lady, she looks different.

2675
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:14,060
Ah!

2676
02:03:15,260 --> 02:03:17,000
Her mouth is down.

2677
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
I wanna ask.

2678
02:03:20,280 --> 02:03:21,600
What's wrong with my appearance?

2679
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,040
She looks different.

2680
02:03:24,460 --> 02:03:27,420
Look carefully at the photos of my papers and compare them well with them.

2681
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:30,060
I don't remember where she lived.

2682
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:34,600
Oh wait, you also didn't give me your entry request.

2683
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:35,100
Oh.

2684
02:03:35,740 --> 02:03:36,540
Here's my entry request.

2685
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:37,280
Thank you.

2686
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:40,360
304.

2687
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:43,700
Yeah, see even the... it's supposed to be way up.

2688
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:46,620
It's supposed to be way, way up.

2689
02:03:50,180 --> 02:03:50,700
Lady!

2690
02:03:53,660 --> 02:03:54,640
Have a nice day!

2691
02:04:01,090 --> 02:04:02,870
This is an easy job.

2692
02:04:03,370 --> 02:04:04,450
Mr. Afton.

2693
02:04:04,810 --> 02:04:05,330
Hello.

2694
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:08,270
71.

2695
02:04:09,510 --> 02:04:09,810
DDD.

2696
02:04:12,210 --> 02:04:12,750
Pharmacist.

2697
02:04:14,950 --> 02:04:16,350
Wait, where did you live again?

2698
02:04:17,010 --> 02:04:17,990
Oh, 301.

2699
02:04:20,510 --> 02:04:21,050
Physicist!

2700
02:04:23,510 --> 02:04:24,050
Wait.

2701
02:04:25,930 --> 02:04:26,890
Oh, physicist.

2702
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:33,260
I think I'm... I think I'm regressing.

2703
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:40,820
You know, it took a lot of energy going from heaven back to manifesting as a ghost.

2704
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:46,840
But you know, maybe I'm losing so much ghostly energy that I'm reverting back into like a...

2705
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:48,020
like a wisp.

2706
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:51,660
Thanks for singing for me.

2707
02:04:51,680 --> 02:04:55,960
I was too shy to ask myself and your fans are absolutely evil in the nicest way possible.

2708
02:04:57,400 --> 02:04:58,620
Of course, Chris!

2709
02:04:58,980 --> 02:05:00,400
If that's really you.

2710
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:02,460
Free supas now!

2711
02:05:04,180 --> 02:05:06,000
First name is Dr. W.

2712
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:06,560
Absolutely.

2713
02:05:07,160 --> 02:05:08,020
Dr. W.

2714
02:05:08,020 --> 02:05:08,560
Afton.

2715
02:05:08,860 --> 02:05:09,500
Alright.

2716
02:05:09,560 --> 02:05:21,100
250 489 656 489 656 214 214 And I'm pretty sure he was on the list.

2717
02:05:21,380 --> 02:05:23,500
So him being out would make sense.

2718
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:26,180
I think we've called even.

2719
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:27,060
1425.

2720
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:31,840
1 4 2 5

2721
02:05:40,350 --> 02:05:40,750
Nope.

2722
02:05:42,350 --> 02:05:44,010
I think we're good to...

2723
02:05:44,010 --> 02:05:46,330
to deny.

2724
02:05:48,490 --> 02:06:10,810
3 3 1 2 That's the call You are never coming back home Those don't rhyme but that's okay.

2725
02:06:11,870 --> 02:06:17,490
I won't survive the end of the day.

2726
02:06:18,310 --> 02:06:23,470
3 3 1 2 Oh!

2727
02:06:23,950 --> 02:06:25,470
You again?

2728
02:06:26,730 --> 02:06:31,970
My gosh, your place is going to be so crowded, madam reptilian.

2729
02:06:32,470 --> 02:06:34,010
Your appearance.

2730
02:06:34,630 --> 02:06:36,530
What's wrong with my appearance?

2731
02:06:36,570 --> 02:06:37,870
I'm just saying.

2732
02:06:40,350 --> 02:06:41,470
Yeah, I did.

2733
02:06:43,250 --> 02:06:45,270
I already answered their question.

2734
02:06:46,970 --> 02:06:48,530
3 times.

2735
02:06:49,950 --> 02:06:50,730
Okay.

2736
02:06:50,930 --> 02:06:52,010
Works for me then.

2737
02:06:55,090 --> 02:06:56,450
She's so popular.

2738
02:06:57,270 --> 02:06:59,010
She's the beauty standard.

2739
02:06:59,350 --> 02:07:00,070
Okay.

2740
02:07:01,850 --> 02:07:03,050
Moment of truth.

2741
02:07:03,390 --> 02:07:09,110
F F F F F F F F F Oh!

2742
02:07:10,590 --> 02:07:12,410
10 people killed.

2743
02:07:16,110 --> 02:07:16,910
Yeah!

2744
02:07:22,390 --> 02:07:23,190
Yippee!

2745
02:07:25,090 --> 02:07:27,050
Oh not just I was like scar.

2746
02:07:27,850 --> 02:07:28,650
Alright!

2747
02:07:31,830 --> 02:07:32,830
Let's go!

2748
02:07:33,230 --> 02:07:34,590
7 is crazy.

2749
02:07:34,770 --> 02:07:35,170
I know.

2750
02:07:36,810 --> 02:07:39,250
We killed 10 people.

2751
02:07:41,230 --> 02:07:41,830
Nice!

2752
02:07:42,650 --> 02:07:43,910
Nice, nice, nice.

2753
02:07:44,210 --> 02:07:47,110
That should also give us another record too though, right?

2754
02:07:47,490 --> 02:07:48,730
If we go back to the menu.

2755
02:07:54,290 --> 02:07:54,890
Yeah!

2756
02:07:55,090 --> 02:07:56,330
Kill an innocent neighbor!

2757
02:07:56,750 --> 02:07:57,450
Get the F!

2758
02:07:59,610 --> 02:08:00,790
Let's go baby!

2759
02:08:02,090 --> 02:08:03,830
I still want to get peach!

2760
02:08:04,250 --> 02:08:07,430
And whatever this catch a doppelganger red-handed.

2761
02:08:09,690 --> 02:08:10,350
How...

2762
02:08:10,350 --> 02:08:11,750
How do you do that?

2763
02:08:15,390 --> 02:08:19,330
Scar is an interesting way to say entire face stitched shut.

2764
02:08:19,430 --> 02:08:19,930
Right?

2765
02:08:27,250 --> 02:08:28,910
You ask questions.

2766
02:08:29,310 --> 02:08:31,150
Oh by questioning them!

2767
02:08:31,690 --> 02:08:32,810
Oh okay, okay, okay.

2768
02:08:34,310 --> 02:08:36,670
Let's try a few more.

2769
02:08:36,770 --> 02:08:41,150
Maybe we'll get peaches or maybe... These are kind of longer games so...

2770
02:08:42,590 --> 02:08:44,530
I don't mind that...

2771
02:08:44,530 --> 02:08:44,830
Uh...

2772
02:08:47,170 --> 02:08:50,970
I kind of like that they don't... It doesn't necessarily need a story.

2773
02:08:51,650 --> 02:08:54,090
It's just kind of like... You play.

2774
02:08:55,830 --> 02:08:56,470
Alright.

2775
02:08:59,350 --> 02:08:59,990
Nice.

2776
02:09:02,130 --> 02:09:04,550
Now we're playing again for real.

2777
02:09:05,710 --> 02:09:07,810
Wait, there was also the... What was it?

2778
02:09:07,830 --> 02:09:10,470
The one where you don't touch any folders?

2779
02:09:11,370 --> 02:09:14,590
So basically I can't touch any of these, right?

2780
02:09:15,410 --> 02:09:16,670
And I have to...

2781
02:09:17,770 --> 02:09:18,330
Right?

2782
02:09:18,590 --> 02:09:20,030
It said no folders.

2783
02:09:20,270 --> 02:09:20,750
So...

2784
02:09:22,030 --> 02:09:23,710
I'm assuming I can look at this.

2785
02:09:30,730 --> 02:09:31,850
Steal memory...

2786
02:09:33,130 --> 02:09:34,250
Uh oh.

2787
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:35,170
What was his phone number?

2788
02:09:37,510 --> 02:09:38,070
Wait...

2789
02:09:38,070 --> 02:09:39,750
Oh, Mr. Afton!

2790
02:09:40,630 --> 02:09:41,910
What was your phone number?

2791
02:09:43,370 --> 02:09:44,710
I'm a resident of the building.

2792
02:09:46,810 --> 02:09:49,730
I'm not on today's list because I had to leave due to an emergency at work.

2793
02:09:54,410 --> 02:09:56,550
3312, you're not gonna get me this time.

2794
02:09:59,470 --> 02:09:59,930
1971...

2795
02:10:01,310 --> 02:10:02,150
No logo!

2796
02:10:02,470 --> 02:10:03,730
No logo, no logo!

2797
02:10:04,030 --> 02:10:05,550
No logo, no entry, mister!

2798
02:10:05,870 --> 02:10:07,150
No logo, no entry!

2799
02:10:13,350 --> 02:10:14,170
Hmm...

2800
02:10:14,170 --> 02:10:14,630
Hmm...

2801
02:10:14,630 --> 02:10:15,310
Hmm...

2802
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:19,650
Nice.

2803
02:10:25,090 --> 02:10:26,510
This is like...

2804
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:28,770
evil Animal Crossing speak.

2805
02:10:30,250 --> 02:10:32,210
Like anti-Animal Crossing.

2806
02:10:32,330 --> 02:10:32,810
Anti- cute.

2807
02:10:37,250 --> 02:10:38,070
Oh...

2808
02:10:38,070 --> 02:10:40,410
Oh no.

2809
02:10:44,710 --> 02:10:45,530
Promo.

2810
02:10:45,630 --> 02:10:47,310
What happened to you?

2811
02:10:49,850 --> 02:10:51,230
What happened to you?

2812
02:10:53,590 --> 02:10:55,630
I don't mean to... I mean...

2813
02:10:55,630 --> 02:10:58,350
It's a little... I look like I always do.

2814
02:10:58,490 --> 02:11:02,290
It's a little rude to say like, hey, what's wrong with your face?

2815
02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:05,530
But, you know, it's just kind of like...

2816
02:11:06,450 --> 02:11:07,870
It's just a little...

2817
02:11:07,870 --> 02:11:08,430
You know...

2818
02:11:16,810 --> 02:11:20,630
Poor guy went to the doctors today and we're sending him to jail.

2819
02:11:21,990 --> 02:11:23,190
He's just like, please.

2820
02:11:23,330 --> 02:11:24,590
I don't feel so well.

2821
02:11:25,670 --> 02:11:27,630
I just want to go home and relax.

2822
02:11:33,070 --> 02:11:33,970
Thank you.

2823
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:40,620
He wasn't even on the list.

2824
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:44,680
Hello, Peachman.

2825
02:11:46,760 --> 02:11:47,720
Good afternoon.

2826
02:11:51,540 --> 02:11:52,060
Shoemaker.

2827
02:11:52,120 --> 02:11:52,620
Yes.

2828
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:55,020
Is he on the list?

2829
02:11:56,240 --> 02:11:57,080
He is.

2830
02:11:58,220 --> 02:11:59,840
He is on the list.

2831
02:12:00,460 --> 02:12:02,860
We can't confirm his uh...

2832
02:12:04,300 --> 02:12:05,960
his ID number.

2833
02:12:06,280 --> 02:12:06,740
But...

2834
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:09,480
You okay, man?

2835
02:12:09,580 --> 02:12:10,340
Yeah, I'm okay.

2836
02:12:11,060 --> 02:12:11,860
I'm all good.

2837
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:16,640
I think we're just gonna have to...

2838
02:12:17,320 --> 02:12:18,540
I think we're just gonna...

2839
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:21,320
Nose looks like it...

2840
02:12:21,320 --> 02:12:21,520
Wait.

2841
02:12:22,120 --> 02:12:22,800
Oh, no.

2842
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:23,920
Wait.

2843
02:12:24,020 --> 02:12:24,660
His appearance.

2844
02:12:24,980 --> 02:12:25,500
Nope.

2845
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:27,280
Everything seems...

2846
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:29,440
according...

2847
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:31,040
to...

2848
02:12:32,060 --> 02:12:33,620
as it should be.

2849
02:12:33,820 --> 02:12:34,940
Thank you for the raid.

2850
02:12:36,140 --> 02:12:36,660
Hello.

2851
02:12:37,900 --> 02:12:41,560
I believe this is correct.

2852
02:12:43,740 --> 02:12:44,660
I think so.

2853
02:12:45,320 --> 02:12:47,460
I think we're good.

2854
02:12:52,570 --> 02:12:53,430
Doing our best.

2855
02:12:53,550 --> 02:12:54,410
Let's see what's here without the folders.

2856
02:12:56,530 --> 02:12:57,130
Okay.

2857
02:12:58,130 --> 02:12:58,730
Hello.

2858
02:12:59,210 --> 02:13:00,270
Good afternoon.

2859
02:13:00,950 --> 02:13:01,550
Arnold.

2860
02:13:02,630 --> 02:13:05,210
We remember that he is always wearing a hat.

2861
02:13:07,070 --> 02:13:07,670
1971.

2862
02:13:08,290 --> 02:13:09,170
Got the logo.

2863
02:13:10,330 --> 02:13:10,930
Murphy!

2864
02:13:11,070 --> 02:13:12,050
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

2865
02:13:15,750 --> 02:13:17,930
All according to Japanese word for plan.

2866
02:13:19,130 --> 02:13:21,190
Keikaku means plan.

2867
02:13:21,550 --> 02:13:22,870
Oh, was he a writer?

2868
02:13:23,550 --> 02:13:25,190
Or did he work at the bank?

2869
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:28,890
I work at the bank.

2870
02:13:29,290 --> 02:13:29,610
No.

2871
02:13:31,310 --> 02:13:32,630
Who was the accountant?

2872
02:13:33,330 --> 02:13:34,350
Roman is the accountant.

2873
02:13:34,550 --> 02:13:38,630
And I think Arnold's wife is the banker.

2874
02:13:40,190 --> 02:13:41,330
He is a writer.

2875
02:13:42,710 --> 02:13:43,350
Getter.

2876
02:13:43,350 --> 02:13:45,190
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

2877
02:13:45,550 --> 02:13:46,110
Ducky.

2878
02:13:46,250 --> 02:13:48,050
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

2879
02:13:49,270 --> 02:13:49,670
Thank you.

2880
02:13:49,670 --> 02:13:49,730
Thank you.

2881
02:13:50,830 --> 02:13:53,550
Okay, I think we're just gonna have to let this guy in then.

2882
02:13:57,410 --> 02:13:58,710
He's on the list too, right?

2883
02:14:00,050 --> 02:14:00,490
Yup.

2884
02:14:01,910 --> 02:14:02,350
201.

2885
02:14:05,510 --> 02:14:06,890
So everything is in order?

2886
02:14:09,330 --> 02:14:11,290
I hate people that work at the bank.

2887
02:14:12,350 --> 02:14:15,010
I work at the bank.

2888
02:14:15,090 --> 02:14:15,410
I work at the bank.

2889
02:14:15,510 --> 02:14:16,470
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

2890
02:14:17,510 --> 02:14:19,230
Thank you for the 50.

2891
02:14:20,810 --> 02:14:21,410
Fun Comics.

2892
02:14:21,470 --> 02:14:22,270
Thank you for the 5.

2893
02:14:23,690 --> 02:14:23,990
Please.

2894
02:14:26,330 --> 02:14:26,630
Sean.

2895
02:14:26,770 --> 02:14:27,850
Thank you for the 10.

2896
02:14:28,750 --> 02:14:29,930
Thank you for the 20.

2897
02:14:31,210 --> 02:14:32,430
Okay, let's just let him in.

2898
02:14:36,450 --> 02:14:38,790
Do you have to get a perfect run to get the achievement?

2899
02:14:38,910 --> 02:14:39,530
You do, yeah.

2900
02:14:43,170 --> 02:14:43,470
Hello.

2901
02:14:43,470 --> 02:14:44,910
Oh gosh, we haven't seen this lady.

2902
02:14:49,330 --> 02:14:51,490
Like we've only seen her like one time.

2903
02:14:51,690 --> 02:14:54,250
But we can compare her appearance with this.

2904
02:14:56,030 --> 02:14:57,030
Looks good.

2905
02:14:57,110 --> 02:14:57,990
Looking good.

2906
02:14:58,230 --> 02:14:58,810
Lois.

2907
02:14:58,810 --> 02:15:00,790
Thank you for the 10.

2908
02:15:03,070 --> 02:15:03,650
Thank you for the 10.

2909
02:15:03,650 --> 02:15:03,830
Kayvar.

2910
02:15:03,870 --> 02:15:04,430
Thanks for the 5.

2911
02:15:04,950 --> 02:15:05,470
Nick Mack.

2912
02:15:05,570 --> 02:15:06,310
Thanks for the 10.

2913
02:15:08,150 --> 02:15:08,730
Guys.

2914
02:15:10,810 --> 02:15:11,970
Lois Stinky.

2915
02:15:13,470 --> 02:15:14,050
1969.

2916
02:15:15,570 --> 02:15:16,950
I'm a resident of this building.

2917
02:15:17,070 --> 02:15:18,110
I went out to visit my mother.

2918
02:15:18,130 --> 02:15:18,850
We got the...

2919
02:15:19,690 --> 02:15:21,050
the DDD logos.

2920
02:15:24,710 --> 02:15:25,150
Mia.

2921
02:15:25,250 --> 02:15:25,990
Thanks for the 5.

2922
02:15:27,570 --> 02:15:28,010
Stinky.

2923
02:15:29,510 --> 02:15:30,810
I think she's good.

2924
02:15:31,030 --> 02:15:31,770
I think she's good.

2925
02:15:32,490 --> 02:15:33,690
From what we can tell.

2926
02:15:34,930 --> 02:15:36,090
I think she's okay.

2927
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:43,620
That's all we can try.

2928
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:45,800
Patkun.

2929
02:15:46,020 --> 02:15:46,700
Thanks for the 10.

2930
02:15:48,640 --> 02:15:49,160
Beep.

2931
02:15:49,160 --> 02:15:49,440
Beep.

2932
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:49,600
Beep.

2933
02:15:49,600 --> 02:15:50,020
Oh.

2934
02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:51,820
Hello.

2935
02:15:54,080 --> 02:15:54,600
Margaret.

2936
02:15:56,140 --> 02:15:57,180
Miss Bubbles.

2937
02:15:57,300 --> 02:15:57,820
Shin.

2938
02:15:57,940 --> 02:15:58,580
Thanks for the 10.

2939
02:15:58,700 --> 02:15:58,960
Kenja.

2940
02:15:59,000 --> 02:15:59,560
Thanks for the 5.

2941
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:02,140
Let's see.

2942
02:16:06,260 --> 02:16:06,780
DDD.

2943
02:16:07,060 --> 02:16:07,580
1975.

2944
02:16:07,980 --> 02:16:09,100
We haven't got...

2945
02:16:09,100 --> 02:16:10,800
We've had the expiration date missing.

2946
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:12,940
But we have not had it incorrect.

2947
02:16:13,740 --> 02:16:14,260
DDD.

2948
02:16:17,900 --> 02:16:18,500
Seamstress.

2949
02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:27,240
Is she a seamstress?

2950
02:16:28,740 --> 02:16:30,000
I don't know.

2951
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:31,380
I don't...

2952
02:16:31,380 --> 02:16:32,400
I don't remember.

2953
02:16:32,580 --> 02:16:34,320
If she was a seamstress or not.

2954
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:36,620
Also, let's check her nose.

2955
02:16:36,720 --> 02:16:37,780
Her nose is good.

2956
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:38,980
Her face is good.

2957
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:40,940
Eyebrows good.

2958
02:16:41,620 --> 02:16:42,180
DDD.

2959
02:16:44,140 --> 02:16:44,740
Beep.

2960
02:16:50,010 --> 02:16:50,610
Seamstress.

2961
02:16:50,930 --> 02:16:52,930
That is actually so true.

2962
02:16:53,650 --> 02:16:53,950
Seamstresses.

2963
02:16:56,810 --> 02:16:58,930
You are not on the list.

2964
02:16:59,190 --> 02:16:59,790
Oh gosh.

2965
02:17:00,030 --> 02:17:00,410
Uh oh.

2966
02:17:01,370 --> 02:17:01,890
DDD.

2967
02:17:03,210 --> 02:17:04,750
I had to leave due to an emergency.

2968
02:17:08,390 --> 02:17:09,750
Why is it glitching out?

2969
02:17:10,590 --> 02:17:12,610
I think it is correct though.

2970
02:17:12,630 --> 02:17:13,210
Her eye color.

2971
02:17:13,370 --> 02:17:15,090
I can't remember her nose at all though.

2972
02:17:15,630 --> 02:17:17,470
I can't remember her nose.

2973
02:17:17,470 --> 02:17:18,310
Oh nose.

2974
02:17:19,490 --> 02:17:21,770
I came from my job as a chef.

2975
02:17:22,270 --> 02:17:24,590
What kind of chef emergency was there?

2976
02:17:25,390 --> 02:17:25,910
What kind of chef emergency was there?

2977
02:17:25,930 --> 02:17:26,990
I can't remember.

2978
02:17:31,530 --> 02:17:36,710
I keep thinking the flying dust in the game is my dirty screen.

2979
02:17:37,190 --> 02:17:37,250
DDD.

2980
02:17:40,210 --> 02:17:41,830
Wrong nose it is.

2981
02:17:43,110 --> 02:17:45,010
We don't have a reference over here.

2982
02:17:45,310 --> 02:17:48,630
We also can't call because probably her daughter is out.

2983
02:17:48,730 --> 02:17:49,690
Kiyoma, thanks for the 10.

2984
02:17:50,710 --> 02:17:51,910
Ellie, welcome to membership.

2985
02:17:51,990 --> 02:17:52,490
Thank you.

2986
02:18:00,630 --> 02:18:02,610
I don't think the nose is wrong.

2987
02:18:04,150 --> 02:18:04,710
DDD.

2988
02:18:05,090 --> 02:18:05,270
I don't think the nose is wrong.

2989
02:18:05,270 --> 02:18:07,090
She should be in though if you call.

2990
02:18:07,190 --> 02:18:08,410
Oh true, true, true, true.

2991
02:18:08,610 --> 02:18:09,790
No, she was a chef.

2992
02:18:10,630 --> 02:18:12,290
She was a chef for sure.

2993
02:18:12,510 --> 02:18:16,110
It's Emma Stone that's a teacher.

2994
02:18:22,370 --> 02:18:22,810
It's Emma Stone that's a teacher.

2995
02:18:22,810 --> 02:18:24,550
Does anybody remember the phone number?

2996
02:18:24,870 --> 02:18:25,310
Does anybody remember the phone number?

2997
02:18:25,310 --> 02:18:26,130
Question her more.

2998
02:18:27,890 --> 02:18:28,330
Oh.

2999
02:18:30,430 --> 02:18:31,090
My ID?

3000
02:18:33,470 --> 02:18:34,870
I don't see anything wrong with my ID.

3001
02:18:38,430 --> 02:18:38,870
Okay.

3002
02:18:39,530 --> 02:18:39,970
Appeared.

3003
02:18:40,590 --> 02:18:41,450
What's wrong with my appearance?

3004
02:18:41,690 --> 02:18:45,490
She seems so happy about me like really interrogating her.

3005
02:18:47,650 --> 02:18:51,290
Did I enter your request?

3006
02:18:53,050 --> 02:18:54,510
I don't see anything wrong with my entry.

3007
02:18:56,450 --> 02:18:58,110
Why does she say the same thing every time?

3008
02:19:00,610 --> 02:19:01,730
Nanoplasm, thank you.

3009
02:19:02,290 --> 02:19:05,390
I was just wondering if you got your moguls minted.

3010
02:19:06,950 --> 02:19:07,790
Moguls minted?

3011
02:19:17,630 --> 02:19:19,050
I don't remember the rest.

3012
02:19:20,690 --> 02:19:21,590
I don't remember the rest.

3013
02:19:23,550 --> 02:19:24,690
I think she's good.

3014
02:19:25,070 --> 02:19:26,130
I think, hopefully.

3015
02:19:26,530 --> 02:19:30,190
I should probably have changed it so that if you get it wrong, it kills you immediately.

3016
02:19:31,570 --> 02:19:33,870
So we don't have to suffer through the entire thing.

3017
02:19:35,150 --> 02:19:35,450
So we don't have to suffer through the entire thing.

3018
02:19:35,450 --> 02:19:35,730
Oh!

3019
02:19:36,970 --> 02:19:38,170
Hi or whatever.

3020
02:19:38,530 --> 02:19:39,350
Give me your ID.

3021
02:19:39,350 --> 02:19:40,470
I forgot to show my ID.

3022
02:19:40,470 --> 02:19:41,890
I forgot to show my ID.

3023
02:19:44,010 --> 02:19:44,570
Whatever.

3024
02:19:45,770 --> 02:19:46,330
Anastacia.

3025
02:19:47,570 --> 02:19:48,990
Okay, we got the DDD.

3026
02:19:49,270 --> 02:19:49,770
1995.

3027
02:19:50,570 --> 02:19:52,050
I live here whatever.

3028
02:19:52,230 --> 02:19:53,130
I come from school.

3029
02:19:53,290 --> 02:19:55,010
We do know that she is a student.

3030
02:19:55,230 --> 02:19:55,790
Whatever.

3031
02:19:58,670 --> 02:19:59,230
204.

3032
02:20:01,170 --> 02:20:01,730
Anastacia.

3033
02:20:03,930 --> 02:20:04,490
Mikael.

3034
02:20:05,130 --> 02:20:05,690
Mikael.

3035
02:20:05,690 --> 02:20:07,730
She's so good.

3036
02:20:12,680 --> 02:20:13,840
She looks...

3037
02:20:15,260 --> 02:20:16,620
She looks good.

3038
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:20,240
Every little single hair is in place.

3039
02:20:20,500 --> 02:20:21,460
Oh my gosh.

3040
02:20:21,460 --> 02:20:25,660
Imagine you had to actually style your hair the same way every day.

3041
02:20:25,860 --> 02:20:31,340
You had to literally put the same little strand of hair.

3042
02:20:31,720 --> 02:20:32,440
You know?

3043
02:20:42,890 --> 02:20:43,570
Yeah.

3044
02:20:54,410 --> 02:20:55,650
I think I'm gonna let her in.

3045
02:21:01,620 --> 02:21:03,840
I think I'm gonna let her in.

3046
02:21:05,660 --> 02:21:09,400
Every single tiny strand of her hair.

3047
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:13,320
Hopefully.

3048
02:21:16,400 --> 02:21:17,760
Hair stranding.

3049
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:20,460
Oh, hello.

3050
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:22,900
Good afternoon, Angus.

3051
02:21:25,340 --> 02:21:25,840
Okay.

3052
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:28,800
He's a businessman.

3053
02:21:29,660 --> 02:21:31,420
We didn't know that about you.

3054
02:21:32,380 --> 02:21:35,960
I'm nervous because I feel like we're not catching a lot of things.

3055
02:21:36,120 --> 02:21:36,540
You know?

3056
02:21:36,760 --> 02:21:38,440
I feel like we're...

3057
02:21:41,480 --> 02:21:42,680
I don't know.

3058
02:21:43,860 --> 02:21:45,540
I look like I'm picking his teeth.

3059
02:21:46,580 --> 02:21:47,080
Um...

3060
02:21:47,080 --> 02:21:47,740
I don't know.

3061
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:49,100
Oh...

3062
02:21:53,610 --> 02:21:55,930
A businessman with a business plan.

3063
02:21:56,370 --> 02:21:57,610
Chris is doppelganger?

3064
02:21:58,190 --> 02:21:58,730
Hello.

3065
02:22:00,570 --> 02:22:01,110
Um...

3066
02:22:01,690 --> 02:22:02,230
Wait.

3067
02:22:02,430 --> 02:22:03,950
How do I know you're a doppelganger?

3068
02:22:04,750 --> 02:22:06,950
Anyone can say that they're the doppelganger.

3069
02:22:08,010 --> 02:22:08,550
But...

3070
02:22:08,550 --> 02:22:10,050
How will I know?

3071
02:22:10,610 --> 02:22:11,930
Prove yourself wrong.

3072
02:22:14,810 --> 02:22:15,910
Three, three, one, two.

3073
02:22:18,850 --> 02:22:20,850
I think we just gotta put this guy in.

3074
02:22:25,340 --> 02:22:25,900
Next.

3075
02:22:31,220 --> 02:22:32,920
Good afternoon, old man.

3076
02:22:33,400 --> 02:22:33,960
Good afternoon, old man.

3077
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:35,060
Wait, I don't know you at all.

3078
02:22:35,580 --> 02:22:36,320
Uh-oh.

3079
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:39,180
Wait, I don't...

3080
02:22:39,180 --> 02:22:40,400
Oh no, it's Alf!

3081
02:22:40,840 --> 02:22:42,740
We've never met Alf before.

3082
02:22:43,480 --> 02:22:44,220
Uh-oh.

3083
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:49,500
Maybe it's too hard to do the steel difficulty.

3084
02:22:50,580 --> 02:22:51,420
Uh-oh.

3085
02:22:52,220 --> 02:22:53,000
Uh-oh.

3086
02:22:54,360 --> 02:22:54,880
No, Alf!

3087
02:22:58,280 --> 02:23:00,020
Am I not on today's list?

3088
02:23:00,220 --> 02:23:00,820
You are not!

3089
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:03,580
I think there's an error.

3090
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:04,840
I should be on the list.

3091
02:23:06,300 --> 02:23:07,860
Look at the list again.

3092
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:12,100
Are you saying that I made a mistake, mister?

3093
02:23:14,600 --> 02:23:15,480
No date?

3094
02:23:17,360 --> 02:23:20,420
You guys are so good.

3095
02:23:20,420 --> 02:23:23,320
You guys are so good!

3096
02:23:26,220 --> 02:23:27,100
Nice.

3097
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,120
Get out of here, Alfie boy!

3098
02:23:36,340 --> 02:23:37,220
Yes.

3099
02:23:38,380 --> 02:23:39,600
Squeaky clean.

3100
02:23:40,340 --> 02:23:42,920
As if he were never here.

3101
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:43,600
As if he were never here.

3102
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:48,200
Not even a single debris of flesh left.

3103
02:23:51,900 --> 02:23:52,500
Hello.

3104
02:23:52,720 --> 02:23:53,600
Where's your ID?

3105
02:23:54,740 --> 02:23:55,840
Here's my ID.

3106
02:23:57,160 --> 02:23:58,920
Miss Illinois.

3107
02:24:00,860 --> 02:24:02,360
Okay, we got the date.

3108
02:24:02,520 --> 02:24:03,080
The DDD.

3109
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:06,640
Let's make sure the name is spelled correctly.

3110
02:24:08,100 --> 02:24:08,700
Search...

3111
02:24:10,040 --> 02:24:10,640
Yep.

3112
02:24:11,580 --> 02:24:12,680
Job is a model.

3113
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:14,840
Resident of the building.

3114
02:24:15,720 --> 02:24:16,840
I think so.

3115
02:24:16,860 --> 02:24:17,280
I think so.

3116
02:24:17,480 --> 02:24:18,800
I think so.

3117
02:24:19,640 --> 02:24:21,000
Goodbye, Monopoly man.

3118
02:24:21,380 --> 02:24:24,700
Does the Monopoly man not have a monocle?

3119
02:24:26,740 --> 02:24:28,960
Isn't that like one of those Mandela effect things?

3120
02:24:30,080 --> 02:24:32,260
She's got the mole on the right side.

3121
02:24:33,480 --> 02:24:34,740
She's looking good.

3122
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:40,300
He never did.

3123
02:24:40,500 --> 02:24:42,000
Yeah, he never had a monocle.

3124
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:46,840
But a lot of people think he had one.

3125
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:48,580
Thanks, K-Barn!

3126
02:24:48,800 --> 02:24:49,520
Silly chat.

3127
02:24:49,620 --> 02:24:50,260
Supas aren't free.

3128
02:24:50,440 --> 02:24:52,440
Streamlabs, though, are totally free.

3129
02:24:52,500 --> 02:24:52,820
Stop!

3130
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:56,400
I think she's good.

3131
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:00,940
It's hard when, uh...

3132
02:25:01,940 --> 02:25:04,880
When you can't call to confirm that the person's there or not.

3133
02:25:05,860 --> 02:25:06,340
Oh!

3134
02:25:07,320 --> 02:25:07,800
Oh!

3135
02:25:11,440 --> 02:25:11,920
Milkman.

3136
02:25:12,340 --> 02:25:12,820
Milkman.

3137
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:13,440
Milkman.

3138
02:25:14,420 --> 02:25:16,480
Did you stretch them to hear better?

3139
02:25:16,840 --> 02:25:19,000
Did you stretch them to hear better?

3140
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:19,640
Leah!

3141
02:25:20,060 --> 02:25:20,760
Oh my gosh!

3142
02:25:20,840 --> 02:25:21,380
Thank you!

3143
02:25:21,460 --> 02:25:22,260
Welcome to membership!

3144
02:25:23,460 --> 02:25:23,980
Stop!

3145
02:25:26,460 --> 02:25:27,680
Thank you so much.

3146
02:25:29,360 --> 02:25:30,740
Bunny fursona bag.

3147
02:25:31,320 --> 02:25:31,400
Bunny fursona bag.

3148
02:25:34,100 --> 02:25:35,440
Wanna nibble on those.

3149
02:25:35,660 --> 02:25:38,480
When people say they like big ears, this is what they mean.

3150
02:25:40,140 --> 02:25:41,920
Pointy ears are a thing of the past.

3151
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:43,360
It's all about the lobes now.

3152
02:25:45,820 --> 02:25:47,800
We're here for long lobes.

3153
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:49,120
Long lobes.

3154
02:25:49,160 --> 02:25:50,180
Long lobes.

3155
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:51,140
Long lobes.

3156
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:51,780
Yeah!

3157
02:25:54,620 --> 02:25:56,640
All that cartilage, baby!

3158
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:00,660
Yeah!

3159
02:26:04,040 --> 02:26:04,540
Sorry.

3160
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:09,480
Last time I was able to let you in, but this time I must reject you, Mr. Lobes.

3161
02:26:15,460 --> 02:26:17,100
I prefer pointy ears.

3162
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:17,940
No, no.

3163
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:18,880
Don't you see him?

3164
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:20,380
And don't you feel a little excited?

3165
02:26:20,720 --> 02:26:22,660
There's something in you that stirs.

3166
02:26:22,660 --> 02:26:24,360
Something you didn't recognize before.

3167
02:26:24,520 --> 02:26:25,700
Something you were like, hmm.

3168
02:26:26,860 --> 02:26:27,740
This is new.

3169
02:26:27,860 --> 02:26:30,900
This is different, but I don't hate it.

3170
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:34,900
I think, in fact, I like it.

3171
02:26:35,540 --> 02:26:36,400
Good afternoon!

3172
02:26:37,540 --> 02:26:38,000
Steven?

3173
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:38,220
Steven?

3174
02:26:39,320 --> 02:26:40,280
Red Boys?

3175
02:26:42,500 --> 02:26:43,060
1966?

3176
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:46,720
A pilot.

3177
02:26:53,830 --> 02:26:54,390
Wait.

3178
02:26:54,510 --> 02:26:55,010
Date.

3179
02:26:55,210 --> 02:26:55,730
DDD.

3180
02:26:55,950 --> 02:26:56,950
Steven Red Boys.

3181
02:26:57,990 --> 02:26:58,550
DDD.

3182
02:27:01,570 --> 02:27:02,830
Go on in, goose.

3183
02:27:05,470 --> 02:27:07,830
I heard supers were free, so here's mine.

3184
02:27:08,210 --> 02:27:10,230
You have heard incorrectly, Rayson.

3185
02:27:10,450 --> 02:27:11,210
But thank you.

3186
02:27:15,270 --> 02:27:15,910
Who?

3187
02:27:17,290 --> 02:27:17,930
Who?

3188
02:27:19,090 --> 02:27:22,070
What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything else?

3189
02:27:22,930 --> 02:27:23,570
Oh!

3190
02:27:23,710 --> 02:27:24,310
42!

3191
02:27:27,970 --> 02:27:28,810
That's correct!

3192
02:27:31,170 --> 02:27:38,690
What is the scientific name of the Australian animal that drastically changes its appearance when removed from its natural habitat?

3193
02:27:39,210 --> 02:27:40,430
This is the quiz!

3194
02:27:40,430 --> 02:27:42,050
Oh my gosh, we got the quiz!

3195
02:27:45,610 --> 02:27:46,230
Huh?

3196
02:27:46,710 --> 02:27:47,170
Huh?

3197
02:27:49,410 --> 02:27:50,030
Chameleon?

3198
02:27:50,030 --> 02:27:50,730
That's what I thought.

3199
02:27:51,490 --> 02:27:53,590
Is a chameleon Australian?

3200
02:27:55,650 --> 02:27:57,190
The drop bear.

3201
02:27:58,510 --> 02:27:59,130
Octopus?

3202
02:28:00,410 --> 02:28:02,730
Oh my gosh, the audio is getting kind of freaky.

3203
02:28:04,050 --> 02:28:05,230
Scientific name.

3204
02:28:10,450 --> 02:28:11,070
Uh.

3205
02:28:11,070 --> 02:28:11,150
Uh.

3206
02:28:14,690 --> 02:28:15,850
Made mint.

3207
02:28:17,770 --> 02:28:18,410
Uh.

3208
02:28:19,170 --> 02:28:20,330
Quick to Google!

3209
02:28:20,530 --> 02:28:22,150
Okay, Google, Google, Google, Google.

3210
02:28:24,710 --> 02:28:25,350
Scientific?

3211
02:28:25,590 --> 02:28:27,530
Sci-en-tif-ic.

3212
02:28:28,090 --> 02:28:28,730
Name.

3213
02:28:30,970 --> 02:28:32,850
Of the Australian...

3214
02:28:32,850 --> 02:28:33,810
Oh my gosh.

3215
02:28:39,270 --> 02:28:44,390
The Australian animal that drastically changes its appearance when removed from its habitat is the echidna!

3216
02:28:44,670 --> 02:28:46,990
Scientifically known as the...

3217
02:28:46,990 --> 02:28:48,190
It's the echidna?

3218
02:28:48,510 --> 02:28:50,010
Sonic Hedgehog?

3219
02:28:50,810 --> 02:28:52,050
Ta-ta-chi...

3220
02:28:52,050 --> 02:28:53,370
Ta...

3221
02:28:53,370 --> 02:28:55,490
Ta-chi...

3222
02:28:56,530 --> 02:28:57,490
Glossis...

3223
02:28:57,950 --> 02:29:00,750
A-cu-li-a-tis.

3224
02:29:01,610 --> 02:29:03,490
A-cu-li-a-tis.

3225
02:29:03,490 --> 02:29:03,590
No!

3226
02:29:04,910 --> 02:29:05,870
No!

3227
02:29:11,270 --> 02:29:16,990
But this was an expert verified answer from Google!

3228
02:29:26,360 --> 02:29:29,100
It says in the top.

3229
02:29:31,420 --> 02:29:33,180
No way!

3230
02:29:40,350 --> 02:29:41,570
Aw, man.

3231
02:29:42,770 --> 02:29:44,990
I think it was the blobfish.

3232
02:29:47,350 --> 02:29:48,770
Why not just echidna?

3233
02:29:48,850 --> 02:29:50,510
Because it said the scientific name.

3234
02:29:53,650 --> 02:29:54,090
Aw...

3235
02:29:54,850 --> 02:29:55,290
Aw...

3236
02:29:58,870 --> 02:30:00,170
Well, we tried the quiz.

3237
02:30:00,310 --> 02:30:00,950
We got the quiz.

3238
02:30:02,110 --> 02:30:03,010
So that's cool.

3239
02:30:03,090 --> 02:30:04,210
We at least got that part.

3240
02:30:04,430 --> 02:30:04,850
I'm glad.

3241
02:30:06,550 --> 02:30:07,850
No, you're not on the list.

3242
02:30:09,230 --> 02:30:09,670
Celine.

3243
02:30:11,010 --> 02:30:12,550
Celine, you're not on the list.

3244
02:30:14,670 --> 02:30:15,110
Uh...

3245
02:30:15,110 --> 02:30:15,570
Uh...

3246
02:30:17,190 --> 02:30:17,990
Wait a second.

3247
02:30:18,190 --> 02:30:19,050
Oh, never mind.

3248
02:30:21,250 --> 02:30:21,990
Oh, yeah.

3249
02:30:22,070 --> 02:30:22,570
It's Ele...

3250
02:30:22,570 --> 02:30:23,050
Okay, yeah.

3251
02:30:23,470 --> 02:30:25,630
I think we gotta not let her in.

3252
02:30:28,230 --> 02:30:30,110
I think we need to not let her in.

3253
02:30:32,270 --> 02:30:32,710
1980.

3254
02:30:39,900 --> 02:30:40,660
The mole.

3255
02:30:41,020 --> 02:30:41,700
No, no, no.

3256
02:30:41,780 --> 02:30:42,260
They're twins.

3257
02:30:42,360 --> 02:30:42,780
They're twins.

3258
02:30:42,880 --> 02:30:43,260
They're twins.

3259
02:30:43,420 --> 02:30:44,180
They're two different people.

3260
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:45,860
They're two different people.

3261
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:48,260
You have Celine and the other...

3262
02:30:49,340 --> 02:30:50,380
They're twins.

3263
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:50,820
They're twins.

3264
02:30:54,860 --> 02:30:55,780
The nose.

3265
02:30:56,220 --> 02:30:57,820
The nose!

3266
02:30:59,100 --> 02:31:00,000
You're so right.

3267
02:31:00,360 --> 02:31:01,840
What's wrong with my appearance?

3268
02:31:03,140 --> 02:31:03,720
I mean...

3269
02:31:03,720 --> 02:31:05,140
I think everything is...

3270
02:31:05,780 --> 02:31:07,840
Everything is fine with my appearance.

3271
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:15,120
Hey, I'm Mint in chat.

3272
02:31:15,300 --> 02:31:16,800
What's your favorite ice cream flavor?

3273
02:31:16,920 --> 02:31:18,420
Mine is chocolate chip mint ice cream.

3274
02:31:18,740 --> 02:31:19,960
Have a fantastic weekend.

3275
02:31:19,960 --> 02:31:21,880
Chocolate chip mint ice, ice, ice.

3276
02:31:25,160 --> 02:31:26,360
My favorite...

3277
02:31:28,680 --> 02:31:31,380
I think I really like...

3278
02:31:31,380 --> 02:31:34,680
It depends on if I'm in a fruity mood or a milky mood.

3279
02:31:34,880 --> 02:31:37,060
I really like Oreo ice cream.

3280
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:40,280
Oreo is so good.

3281
02:31:41,220 --> 02:31:43,320
But I also like mint.

3282
02:31:43,580 --> 02:31:44,400
Chocolate mint.

3283
02:31:46,100 --> 02:31:46,700
Yeah.

3284
02:31:46,700 --> 02:31:49,940
It's so funny because a lot of people draw me as like ice cream.

3285
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:52,160
But...

3286
02:31:52,160 --> 02:31:53,680
That was never really my intention.

3287
02:31:54,140 --> 02:31:55,900
Because especially with like my...

3288
02:31:55,900 --> 02:31:57,920
You know, original look.

3289
02:31:58,360 --> 02:32:00,240
I was never so...

3290
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:01,860
You know, my name is Mint.

3291
02:32:01,980 --> 02:32:03,320
And I wear a lot of mint.

3292
02:32:03,440 --> 02:32:04,720
But I was never mint chocolate.

3293
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:05,880
And then...

3294
02:32:05,880 --> 02:32:09,600
With this outfit, I only added a little bit of chocolate motifs.

3295
02:32:09,800 --> 02:32:10,240
But...

3296
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:12,640
A lot of people draw me as ice cream.

3297
02:32:12,640 --> 02:32:12,980
Haha.

3298
02:32:17,100 --> 02:32:21,440
What did she say?

3299
02:32:21,580 --> 02:32:22,000
Oh, sorry.

3300
02:32:22,120 --> 02:32:22,900
I was not paying attention.

3301
02:32:23,100 --> 02:32:23,660
What did you say, lady?

3302
02:32:26,440 --> 02:32:27,280
I didn't...

3303
02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:27,820
What?

3304
02:32:27,980 --> 02:32:28,840
You said check it again?

3305
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:29,400
Whatever.

3306
02:32:33,220 --> 02:32:35,080
I think we should not let her in.

3307
02:32:35,900 --> 02:32:36,320
Because...

3308
02:32:36,320 --> 02:32:38,040
Mia Stone...

3309
02:32:38,660 --> 02:32:41,440
You did not put your thing about being a teacher.

3310
02:32:41,600 --> 02:32:42,140
You did not put your thing about being a teacher.

3311
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:43,680
Oh, emergency at work.

3312
02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:44,820
Oh...

3313
02:32:47,080 --> 02:32:48,460
No stamp here!

3314
02:32:49,480 --> 02:32:50,140
Oh...

3315
02:32:50,140 --> 02:32:51,160
No stamp here!

3316
02:32:51,640 --> 02:32:54,520
It's so confusing because they put the stamps here.

3317
02:32:55,060 --> 02:32:56,120
So like...

3318
02:32:56,120 --> 02:32:59,400
I instinctually think that the stamps are going to be there.

3319
02:33:00,020 --> 02:33:01,100
You know what I mean?

3320
02:33:01,780 --> 02:33:02,440
3...

3321
02:33:02,440 --> 02:33:04,200
3... 1...

3322
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:05,000
2...

3323
02:33:07,300 --> 02:33:10,120
Mint Oreo ice cream is next level TBH.

3324
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:10,600
Haha.

3325
02:33:10,680 --> 02:33:10,800
Haha.

3326
02:33:13,640 --> 02:33:14,080
Skip.

3327
02:33:16,480 --> 02:33:18,380
They draw you as ice cream because you are so cool?

3328
02:33:18,740 --> 02:33:18,880
Haha.

3329
02:33:19,300 --> 02:33:19,740
Thanks.

3330
02:33:20,700 --> 02:33:21,340
Hey, Mint.

3331
02:33:21,420 --> 02:33:22,480
Chris' wife here.

3332
02:33:22,720 --> 02:33:23,560
Have you seen him?

3333
02:33:23,560 --> 02:33:24,440
He is running away.

3334
02:33:25,300 --> 02:33:27,120
No, I didn't let the doppelganger in.

3335
02:33:28,180 --> 02:33:28,620
What?

3336
02:33:29,300 --> 02:33:29,740
No!

3337
02:33:36,710 --> 02:33:37,930
Who was it?

3338
02:33:37,930 --> 02:33:38,050
Who was it?

3339
02:33:40,470 --> 02:33:42,030
Who was it?

3340
02:33:42,030 --> 02:33:43,110
Who was it?

3341
02:33:43,110 --> 02:33:43,810
Just one.

3342
02:33:44,950 --> 02:33:46,130
Who was it?

3343
02:33:46,710 --> 02:33:46,810
Who was it?

3344
02:33:49,590 --> 02:33:52,420
Who was it?

3345
02:33:52,420 --> 02:33:53,980
You guys did say the nose.

3346
02:33:55,340 --> 02:33:57,420
You guys did say Nacha's nose.

3347
02:33:57,980 --> 02:33:59,340
You did say...

3348
02:33:59,340 --> 02:34:00,580
That was so close.

3349
02:34:01,360 --> 02:34:03,380
That was so close.

3350
02:34:03,800 --> 02:34:04,440
That was so close.

3351
02:34:04,740 --> 02:34:07,460
Nacha, Nacha neighbor, for real.

3352
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:09,660
That was so close.

3353
02:34:09,660 --> 02:34:09,960
You got an A.

3354
02:34:12,080 --> 02:34:12,560
Dang.

3355
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:14,360
It was the nose.

3356
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:18,080
I should have known.

3357
02:34:19,160 --> 02:34:19,640
Nosed.

3358
02:34:19,960 --> 02:34:21,440
Because you guys are experts.

3359
02:34:21,700 --> 02:34:23,200
You guys are nose experts.

3360
02:34:23,400 --> 02:34:23,840
Apparently.

3361
02:34:25,180 --> 02:34:26,540
I really want to see Peaches.

3362
02:34:26,620 --> 02:34:27,500
So let's try one more time.

3363
02:34:28,700 --> 02:34:29,980
Let's try one more time.

3364
02:34:30,800 --> 02:34:32,720
And we are going to also try...

3365
02:34:32,720 --> 02:34:34,920
The memory thing as well.

3366
02:34:35,240 --> 02:34:37,120
Last run.

3367
02:34:37,260 --> 02:34:38,240
LG, LG, LG.

3368
02:34:42,040 --> 02:34:42,600
Hello.

3369
02:34:43,420 --> 02:34:43,980
Hello.

3370
02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:44,600
Hello.

3371
02:34:44,600 --> 02:34:45,200
Oh my gosh.

3372
02:34:45,420 --> 02:34:47,140
It's a full roster.

3373
02:34:48,740 --> 02:34:50,940
And maybe we'll get the quiz guy again too.

3374
02:34:57,100 --> 02:34:59,240
I came from my job as a model.

3375
02:35:00,060 --> 02:35:02,940
And the logo, and the logo, and the date.

3376
02:35:03,720 --> 02:35:04,380
And the logo, and the logo, and the date.

3377
02:35:04,380 --> 02:35:04,980
Yes, yes, yes.

3378
02:35:06,360 --> 02:35:07,480
I think...

3379
02:35:08,420 --> 02:35:09,460
That we're good.

3380
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:10,540
She's also on the list.

3381
02:35:11,580 --> 02:35:13,300
104, 104, yup.

3382
02:35:18,060 --> 02:35:19,880
The thing was the blobfish.

3383
02:35:20,700 --> 02:35:21,340
I know.

3384
02:35:21,400 --> 02:35:22,480
Everybody's been saying that.

3385
02:35:23,220 --> 02:35:23,840
Oh, hello.

3386
02:35:24,520 --> 02:35:25,380
Good afternoon.

3387
02:35:27,460 --> 02:35:28,700
McCluey Red Boys.

3388
02:35:28,940 --> 02:35:29,980
He's always wearing his hat.

3389
02:35:30,120 --> 02:35:30,740
It said that.

3390
02:35:30,900 --> 02:35:31,620
The thing.

3391
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:32,220
We got a date.

3392
02:35:32,240 --> 02:35:33,000
We got a stamp.

3393
02:35:33,700 --> 02:35:34,820
Got some numbers.

3394
02:35:34,820 --> 02:35:36,380
Can't tell if they're right or wrong.

3395
02:35:36,520 --> 02:35:37,340
We have no idea.

3396
02:35:37,880 --> 02:35:39,280
His nose seems right.

3397
02:35:39,360 --> 02:35:40,200
His mustache seems right.

3398
02:35:40,280 --> 02:35:41,240
Everything seems correct.

3399
02:35:42,820 --> 02:35:44,280
Doing some shopping.

3400
02:35:44,600 --> 02:35:45,540
Oh, he's retired.

3401
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:46,520
So that makes sense.

3402
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:48,240
Um...

3403
02:35:48,240 --> 02:35:49,580
He's got the stamp.

3404
02:35:52,940 --> 02:35:54,480
Ask to remove his hat.

3405
02:35:54,600 --> 02:35:55,300
Can I do that?

3406
02:36:00,400 --> 02:36:01,960
Remove your hat, sir.

3407
02:36:04,980 --> 02:36:05,740
Blah, blah, blah.

3408
02:36:06,740 --> 02:36:07,060
Okay.

3409
02:36:09,820 --> 02:36:10,760
I think he's good.

3410
02:36:21,110 --> 02:36:21,530
McCluey.

3411
02:36:21,990 --> 02:36:23,270
Yeah, that's his name.

3412
02:36:24,170 --> 02:36:24,930
Hello, milk.

3413
02:36:26,390 --> 02:36:26,810
Meh.

3414
02:36:28,550 --> 02:36:29,210
Your nose.

3415
02:36:31,370 --> 02:36:32,450
That is not your nose.

3416
02:36:33,290 --> 02:36:34,670
That is not the correct nose.

3417
02:36:35,750 --> 02:36:36,170
No.

3418
02:36:36,670 --> 02:36:37,090
No.

3419
02:36:38,150 --> 02:36:39,170
No, no, no, no.

3420
02:36:39,510 --> 02:36:40,690
That is not your nose.

3421
02:36:41,030 --> 02:36:42,050
That is not your nose.

3422
02:36:49,670 --> 02:36:50,890
That is not his nose.

3423
02:36:51,310 --> 02:36:51,750
That is not his nose.

3424
02:36:51,750 --> 02:36:51,970
I know.

3425
02:36:53,070 --> 02:36:54,390
It was not his nose.

3426
02:36:55,690 --> 02:36:57,410
His nose was not so defined.

3427
02:37:01,610 --> 02:37:02,830
I'm almost positive.

3428
02:37:03,830 --> 02:37:04,630
I'm like...

3429
02:37:05,250 --> 02:37:06,090
Check his file.

3430
02:37:06,190 --> 02:37:08,270
No, we're doing a run where we don't check the files.

3431
02:37:14,110 --> 02:37:15,390
That was not his nose.

3432
02:37:15,790 --> 02:37:16,790
I know it.

3433
02:37:16,850 --> 02:37:17,410
I know it.

3434
02:37:17,410 --> 02:37:17,890
I know it.

3435
02:37:19,990 --> 02:37:20,430
Um...

3436
02:37:21,310 --> 02:37:21,390
Hello?

3437
02:37:23,270 --> 02:37:24,230
Uh...

3438
02:37:24,230 --> 02:37:25,630
Entry request?

3439
02:37:27,010 --> 02:37:27,490
Uh...

3440
02:37:27,490 --> 02:37:30,370
Not on the list.

3441
02:37:31,250 --> 02:37:32,810
Due to an emergency?

3442
02:37:34,130 --> 02:37:35,710
What kind of emergency?

3443
02:37:35,950 --> 02:37:36,510
Slain?

3444
02:37:40,170 --> 02:37:41,130
Uh...

3445
02:37:42,130 --> 02:37:43,090
Model.

3446
02:37:43,990 --> 02:37:45,830
But no, you said emergency.

3447
02:37:47,010 --> 02:37:48,190
The mole?

3448
02:37:48,190 --> 02:37:49,290
No, no, that's the sister.

3449
02:37:49,410 --> 02:37:49,910
It's the sister.

3450
02:38:05,070 --> 02:38:05,710
Yeah,

3451
02:38:09,110 --> 02:38:12,650
there's the sister Celine and the sister Ellen...

3452
02:38:13,550 --> 02:38:14,190
something.

3453
02:38:14,930 --> 02:38:15,570
Ellen...

3454
02:38:15,570 --> 02:38:16,210
Ellen...

3455
02:38:17,050 --> 02:38:17,690
Illinois.

3456
02:38:20,290 --> 02:38:21,430
Illinois, yeah.

3457
02:38:22,370 --> 02:38:23,010
Illinois.

3458
02:38:24,790 --> 02:38:25,730
Okay, nice.

3459
02:38:26,050 --> 02:38:26,750
Good job, everybody.

3460
02:38:29,330 --> 02:38:29,970
Oh!

3461
02:38:29,970 --> 02:38:30,790
Hello.

3462
02:38:31,210 --> 02:38:31,870
Hello.

3463
02:38:32,910 --> 02:38:34,430
Uh, your ID, sir?

3464
02:38:36,470 --> 02:38:44,230
Oh, he got back from his lobotomy.

3465
02:38:45,470 --> 02:38:46,730
That must be it.

3466
02:38:49,390 --> 02:38:50,110
XLR8?

3467
02:38:53,110 --> 02:38:53,830
Uh...

3468
02:38:58,170 --> 02:38:59,390
You're not...

3469
02:38:59,390 --> 02:39:01,850
Oh, sir, you're not on today's list.

3470
02:39:02,970 --> 02:39:03,890
Am I not on today's list?

3471
02:39:05,370 --> 02:39:06,530
There must be a mistake.

3472
02:39:06,670 --> 02:39:07,750
I should be on the list.

3473
02:39:09,790 --> 02:39:10,990
Look at the list again.

3474
02:39:12,910 --> 02:39:13,450
Lobotomy.

3475
02:39:13,950 --> 02:39:14,490
Lobotomy.

3476
02:39:16,750 --> 02:39:17,690
My forehead?

3477
02:39:17,990 --> 02:39:18,250
Yeah.

3478
02:39:19,930 --> 02:39:20,630
It's nothing.

3479
02:39:20,890 --> 02:39:22,050
Just ignore it.

3480
02:39:22,590 --> 02:39:23,130
Okay.

3481
02:39:27,730 --> 02:39:28,270
Yeah.

3482
02:39:35,510 --> 02:39:36,770
Door bar.

3483
02:39:36,910 --> 02:39:38,930
I got that Suguru hair like...

3484
02:39:39,830 --> 02:39:40,590
Stop.

3485
02:39:42,170 --> 02:39:44,630
Learn a thing and talk to me.

3486
02:39:47,230 --> 02:39:47,990
Satoru.

3487
02:39:48,090 --> 02:39:49,870
When I was gone.

3488
02:39:50,810 --> 02:39:51,670
Wait, no.

3489
02:39:51,730 --> 02:39:52,110
Gojo.

3490
02:39:52,710 --> 02:39:53,470
Satoru.

3491
02:39:56,810 --> 02:39:57,190
Hello.

3492
02:39:57,570 --> 02:39:59,110
You are always out.

3493
02:40:00,750 --> 02:40:01,690
Mr. Angus.

3494
02:40:01,870 --> 02:40:02,490
Oh.

3495
02:40:02,970 --> 02:40:03,630
ID, please.

3496
02:40:08,970 --> 02:40:10,350
Don't make me sob.

3497
02:40:12,910 --> 02:40:13,550
1968.

3498
02:40:15,510 --> 02:40:16,790
Nose.

3499
02:40:16,790 --> 02:40:17,690
Mustache.

3500
02:40:18,510 --> 02:40:20,090
Appearance seems...

3501
02:40:20,550 --> 02:40:21,190
Typical.

3502
02:40:23,550 --> 02:40:24,830
Stamp.

3503
02:40:25,550 --> 02:40:29,370
Angus Kipriani.

3504
02:40:33,880 --> 02:40:35,660
Angus Kipriani.

3505
02:40:35,660 --> 02:40:36,180
I think we're good.

3506
02:40:39,720 --> 02:40:40,540
I think he's good.

3507
02:40:44,260 --> 02:40:44,920
The tie?

3508
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:45,700
No, it's good.

3509
02:40:47,980 --> 02:40:48,560
No job?

3510
02:40:48,660 --> 02:40:50,460
I don't think they have to say it every time, do they?

3511
02:40:53,260 --> 02:40:54,780
I don't think they say it...

3512
02:40:54,780 --> 02:40:55,960
They have to say it every time.

3513
02:41:00,250 --> 02:41:01,030
I think we're good.

3514
02:41:05,030 --> 02:41:05,550
Bye bye.

3515
02:41:09,820 --> 02:41:10,440
Next, please.

3516
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:10,600
Next, please.

3517
02:41:15,180 --> 02:41:15,920
Uh oh.

3518
02:41:17,400 --> 02:41:18,500
Uh oh.

3519
02:41:21,640 --> 02:41:22,200
Ahh...

3520
02:41:32,230 --> 02:41:33,350
Uh oh.

3521
02:41:37,180 --> 02:41:38,060
Uh oh.

3522
02:41:42,760 --> 02:41:43,620
Uh oh.

3523
02:41:51,700 --> 02:41:52,820
The apartment?

3524
02:41:52,960 --> 02:41:53,040
The apartment?

3525
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:54,840
Oh my gosh, that's so sneaky.

3526
02:41:55,280 --> 02:41:55,660
Wait, no.

3527
02:41:55,700 --> 02:41:56,080
It's correct.

3528
02:41:56,080 --> 02:41:56,280
It's correct.

3529
02:41:57,940 --> 02:41:58,800
It's correct.

3530
02:41:58,900 --> 02:41:59,140
Wait.

3531
02:41:59,620 --> 02:42:00,460
Oh, 30!

3532
02:42:01,300 --> 02:42:03,740
Wow, that's really sneaky!

3533
02:42:05,120 --> 02:42:08,100
That is so sneaky!

3534
02:42:15,540 --> 02:42:17,540
Sorry, numbers really confuse me.

3535
02:42:19,680 --> 02:42:21,180
You almost got got, girl!

3536
02:42:21,440 --> 02:42:21,780
I know!

3537
02:42:22,660 --> 02:42:26,820
Well, I would have reported him anyway because we already let the other guy in.

3538
02:42:26,960 --> 02:42:30,020
Well, I would have reported him anyway because we already let the other guy in.

3539
02:42:30,020 --> 02:42:31,400
I would have sent him away anyway.

3540
02:42:32,020 --> 02:42:32,760
Thank you!

3541
02:42:33,680 --> 02:42:34,680
Thank you!

3542
02:42:34,800 --> 02:42:35,760
Thank you!

3543
02:42:36,700 --> 02:42:37,200
Next!

3544
02:42:39,440 --> 02:42:40,260
Get over here!

3545
02:42:40,540 --> 02:42:41,040
Next!

3546
02:42:42,240 --> 02:42:43,240
Good afternoon.

3547
02:42:43,360 --> 02:42:44,040
Where's your ID?

3548
02:42:46,360 --> 02:42:48,420
Yeah, you did forget to show me your ID.

3549
02:42:48,700 --> 02:42:50,480
Big mistake, Mia Stone.

3550
02:42:52,120 --> 02:42:53,120
Big mistake.

3551
02:42:56,560 --> 02:42:57,860
Okay, we got a date.

3552
02:42:58,560 --> 02:43:02,200
We've got a We've got a stamp.

3553
02:43:02,980 --> 02:43:04,320
We've got some names.

3554
02:43:06,340 --> 02:43:09,940
Now I have to worry about other things that I didn't even think about having to check before.

3555
02:43:10,080 --> 02:43:10,920
She's a teacher.

3556
02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:11,680
Yes, she is.

3557
02:43:11,720 --> 02:43:12,420
We got a stamp.

3558
02:43:14,540 --> 02:43:14,940
0301.

3559
02:43:17,940 --> 02:43:18,740
I think...

3560
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:22,100
I think she's good.

3561
02:43:25,100 --> 02:43:27,840
Wait, we didn't let her in earlier, did we?

3562
02:43:30,020 --> 02:43:30,660
I don't think we did.

3563
02:43:31,300 --> 02:43:32,660
I don't think we let her in earlier.

3564
02:43:32,820 --> 02:43:33,460
I think we'll...

3565
02:43:36,530 --> 02:43:37,510
I think we're good.

3566
02:43:38,290 --> 02:43:38,690
No?

3567
02:43:45,290 --> 02:43:46,090
Everything is...

3568
02:43:46,090 --> 02:43:49,690
I can't tell if it's my internet or why everything is starting to stutter a little bit.

3569
02:43:49,930 --> 02:43:50,690
Alright, let's let her in.

3570
02:43:52,950 --> 02:43:53,630
Previous run.

3571
02:43:53,750 --> 02:43:55,170
The runs are really fusing together.

3572
02:43:55,270 --> 02:43:55,670
They are!

3573
02:43:56,190 --> 02:43:56,870
They are.

3574
02:43:58,390 --> 02:43:58,790
Hello!

3575
02:44:00,970 --> 02:44:01,370
ID!

3576
02:44:01,370 --> 02:44:01,450
ID!

3577
02:44:04,030 --> 02:44:04,850
Yeah, this is...

3578
02:44:05,230 --> 02:44:07,370
It's like starting to lag a little bit.

3579
02:44:08,130 --> 02:44:08,570
Okay.

3580
02:44:09,270 --> 02:44:09,710
Gloria.

3581
02:44:09,830 --> 02:44:11,270
This is our last run, so...

3582
02:44:11,270 --> 02:44:13,670
Oh my gosh, I thought that was a mole?

3583
02:44:14,450 --> 02:44:15,430
I was like...

3584
02:44:15,430 --> 02:44:17,050
The mole is on the wrong side!

3585
02:44:20,030 --> 02:44:21,650
No seems up to par.

3586
02:44:23,650 --> 02:44:24,090
Yes.

3587
02:44:26,750 --> 02:44:27,190
Date.

3588
02:44:28,350 --> 02:44:28,790
Stamp.

3589
02:44:30,770 --> 02:44:31,210
Date.

3590
02:44:31,370 --> 02:44:31,610
Date.

3591
02:44:34,410 --> 02:44:40,110
0201 0201 I think we have to let her in.

3592
02:44:40,710 --> 02:44:42,670
I think we have to let her in.

3593
02:44:42,810 --> 02:44:43,870
I thought so too.

3594
02:44:44,190 --> 02:44:44,590
I know, right?

3595
02:44:47,270 --> 02:44:47,670
Next!

3596
02:44:49,130 --> 02:44:50,290
Next, next, next!

3597
02:44:53,730 --> 02:44:54,130
Oh!

3598
02:44:54,730 --> 02:44:55,430
Oh my gosh!

3599
02:44:55,470 --> 02:44:56,630
Why didn't you guys come in together?

3600
02:44:57,490 --> 02:44:57,890
Arnold!

3601
02:45:00,370 --> 02:45:00,770
Date.

3602
02:45:02,430 --> 02:45:03,830
Let's check your appearance.

3603
02:45:04,330 --> 02:45:06,030
You got your handle bar mustache.

3604
02:45:06,370 --> 02:45:07,290
Very good.

3605
02:45:07,790 --> 02:45:09,410
You got your little hat on.

3606
02:45:09,750 --> 02:45:10,690
Job as a writer.

3607
02:45:10,930 --> 02:45:12,030
Yes, that's correct as well.

3608
02:45:12,850 --> 02:45:14,370
I'm gonna have to let you in.

3609
02:45:17,450 --> 02:45:18,010
I'm gonna have to let you in.

3610
02:45:18,010 --> 02:45:19,410
Hopefully I didn't oversee anything.

3611
02:45:19,810 --> 02:45:21,650
Hopefully I didn't miss something.

3612
02:45:22,250 --> 02:45:22,810
Hopefully I didn't miss something.

3613
02:45:24,210 --> 02:45:24,770
Hello!

3614
02:45:27,450 --> 02:45:29,390
I think we were right though.

3615
02:45:31,710 --> 02:45:33,310
Why are you not on today's list?

3616
02:45:36,950 --> 02:45:38,150
There must be a mistake.

3617
02:45:38,270 --> 02:45:38,970
I should be on the list.

3618
02:45:40,490 --> 02:45:41,270
I don't think so.

3619
02:45:41,490 --> 02:45:42,630
I don't see you.

3620
02:45:44,250 --> 02:45:45,150
We've got a date.

3621
02:45:45,190 --> 02:45:45,830
We've got a stamp.

3622
02:45:46,770 --> 02:45:47,730
No stamp here.

3623
02:45:47,790 --> 02:45:48,490
No go madam.

3624
02:45:50,190 --> 02:45:50,590
Security!

3625
02:45:52,450 --> 02:45:52,850
Security!

3626
02:45:53,130 --> 02:45:53,930
Get this!

3627
02:45:56,190 --> 02:45:57,970
She is disturbing me!

3628
02:45:58,950 --> 02:45:59,630
Please!

3629
02:45:59,630 --> 02:46:00,870
I feel unsafe!

3630
02:46:02,990 --> 02:46:03,830
Thank you.

3631
02:46:09,750 --> 02:46:10,430
Busting!

3632
02:46:10,430 --> 02:46:11,110
Busting!

3633
02:46:11,310 --> 02:46:11,990
Busting!

3634
02:46:14,370 --> 02:46:15,050
Next!

3635
02:46:20,970 --> 02:46:22,330
No mole.

3636
02:46:22,450 --> 02:46:23,810
Oh my god it's the hidden sister.

3637
02:46:24,770 --> 02:46:25,650
It's her!

3638
02:46:25,650 --> 02:46:25,850
It's her!

3639
02:46:27,190 --> 02:46:27,770
Solidus!

3640
02:46:32,610 --> 02:46:34,050
What's wrong with my appearance?

3641
02:46:36,730 --> 02:46:38,710
I think everything is fine with my appearance.

3642
02:46:40,470 --> 02:46:41,290
Think again.

3643
02:46:42,670 --> 02:46:44,190
Do you even think?

3644
02:46:46,710 --> 02:46:47,990
Here's my entry request.

3645
02:46:48,370 --> 02:46:50,110
Wow she forged it really well.

3646
02:46:51,390 --> 02:46:52,970
She's got the stamp and everything.

3647
02:46:56,910 --> 02:46:57,490
Yep.

3648
02:46:57,510 --> 02:46:57,670
Yep.

3649
02:46:59,490 --> 02:47:00,550
No moles.

3650
02:47:00,610 --> 02:47:01,470
No moles.

3651
02:47:01,550 --> 02:47:02,010
No go.

3652
02:47:02,870 --> 02:47:03,710
Okay miss.

3653
02:47:04,150 --> 02:47:05,370
Miss Illinois.

3654
02:47:10,930 --> 02:47:12,390
Little do we know.

3655
02:47:12,490 --> 02:47:14,630
She's coming back from the doctors.

3656
02:47:15,210 --> 02:47:16,110
She's just like.

3657
02:47:16,230 --> 02:47:17,590
I just had the worst day.

3658
02:47:18,430 --> 02:47:21,770
Getting this mole removed was so much more painful.

3659
02:47:21,910 --> 02:47:23,070
Than I imagined it to be.

3660
02:47:24,790 --> 02:47:26,530
I forgot to tell the entrance.

3661
02:47:27,690 --> 02:47:28,730
They'll recognize me.

3662
02:47:28,770 --> 02:47:29,470
They'll let me in.

3663
02:47:29,530 --> 02:47:30,210
It's no big deal.

3664
02:47:30,990 --> 02:47:32,170
And we send her.

3665
02:47:34,450 --> 02:47:35,290
To jail.

3666
02:47:36,670 --> 02:47:37,510
Or to die.

3667
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:38,130
I don't know.

3668
02:47:38,290 --> 02:47:39,690
Do they die or they...

3669
02:47:40,650 --> 02:47:41,410
Good afternoon.

3670
02:47:41,470 --> 02:47:43,350
Where is your entry request?

3671
02:47:43,970 --> 02:47:44,510
Thank you.

3672
02:47:46,490 --> 02:47:46,910
Mia...

3673
02:47:46,910 --> 02:47:49,070
Didn't we let Mia Stone in before already?

3674
02:47:53,520 --> 02:47:54,380
Uh oh this one.

3675
02:47:54,480 --> 02:47:54,760
Wait.

3676
02:48:01,550 --> 02:48:02,390
Yes we did.

3677
02:48:09,880 --> 02:48:11,040
The second wife.

3678
02:48:14,420 --> 02:48:15,400
The second.

3679
02:48:15,660 --> 02:48:16,680
The second wife.

3680
02:48:17,920 --> 02:48:18,440
1978.

3681
02:48:25,410 --> 02:48:26,850
I hope it wasn't like.

3682
02:48:27,010 --> 02:48:28,930
The numbers were wrong.

3683
02:48:29,130 --> 02:48:30,150
Like the ID numbers.

3684
02:48:30,290 --> 02:48:31,270
Because there's no way.

3685
02:48:33,750 --> 02:48:35,070
I'm a resident of the building.

3686
02:48:35,130 --> 02:48:36,410
I come from my job as a teacher.

3687
02:48:37,070 --> 02:48:38,230
Anyone could know that.

3688
02:48:38,870 --> 02:48:40,870
Anyone could know Mia Stone's a teacher.

3689
02:48:42,190 --> 02:48:43,790
You creepy doppelganger.

3690
02:48:45,750 --> 02:48:46,150
Hmm.

3691
02:48:49,670 --> 02:48:51,250
Guess we'll just have to not let her in.

3692
02:48:51,310 --> 02:48:51,550
I think.

3693
02:48:54,370 --> 02:48:56,230
I think we'll just have to not let her in.

3694
02:49:06,180 --> 02:49:06,980
I think we'll just have to not let her in.

3695
02:49:06,980 --> 02:49:08,260
The last one had no logo?

3696
02:49:28,650 --> 02:49:29,450
The last one had no logo?

3697
02:49:29,450 --> 02:49:29,690
No logo?

3698
02:49:30,710 --> 02:49:31,210
No logo?

3699
02:49:35,890 --> 02:49:38,330
If that was the last one, I'm going to cry.

3700
02:49:44,220 --> 02:49:45,180
You bitch!

3701
02:49:47,400 --> 02:49:48,460
Get out of here!

3702
02:49:50,280 --> 02:49:52,280
Get out of here with your round face!

3703
02:49:52,620 --> 02:49:53,520
I don't want to see you!

3704
02:49:55,480 --> 02:49:56,880
I don't want to see you!

3705
02:50:07,410 --> 02:50:07,890
No!

3706
02:50:07,890 --> 02:50:09,170
No!

3707
02:50:10,730 --> 02:50:13,130
I can't believe we messed up!

3708
02:50:15,910 --> 02:50:19,690
I should have... I should have kept track.

3709
02:50:19,870 --> 02:50:22,790
I should have kept track of whether I...

3710
02:50:25,950 --> 02:50:27,250
Old man!

3711
02:50:33,460 --> 02:50:34,180
Please...

3712
02:50:35,420 --> 02:50:40,800
I don't even feel like... I don't even feel the motivation anymore.

3713
02:50:45,010 --> 02:50:45,650
Ugh.

3714
02:50:46,430 --> 02:50:47,450
Rip run.

3715
02:50:47,650 --> 02:50:48,110
Yeah.

3716
02:50:55,610 --> 02:50:57,430
He seems fine.

3717
02:50:57,490 --> 02:50:58,370
Doesn't matter anyway.

3718
02:50:58,710 --> 02:50:59,330
Just let him in.

3719
02:51:01,450 --> 02:51:02,710
Just let him in.

3720
02:51:03,970 --> 02:51:05,530
How many people are left?

3721
02:51:08,010 --> 02:51:08,650
No!

3722
02:51:08,990 --> 02:51:11,150
You always have your hat on!

3723
02:51:12,110 --> 02:51:12,750
Roman!

3724
02:51:12,750 --> 02:51:12,850
Roman!

3725
02:51:16,830 --> 02:51:17,190
Wait.

3726
02:51:17,190 --> 02:51:18,550
I want to ask him about it.

3727
02:51:21,450 --> 02:51:23,310
Oh my appearance.

3728
02:51:23,510 --> 02:51:24,410
Is it because of my hat?

3729
02:51:26,430 --> 02:51:27,430
I forgot it at home.

3730
02:51:27,730 --> 02:51:29,370
He didn't call my apartment and ask my wife.

3731
02:51:31,810 --> 02:51:32,170
Wait.

3732
02:51:32,230 --> 02:51:33,230
I didn't expect that answer.

3733
02:51:34,130 --> 02:51:36,150
I thought he said he'd like lose it or something.

3734
02:51:37,030 --> 02:51:37,630
No way.

3735
02:51:38,710 --> 02:51:39,810
You left it at home?

3736
02:51:39,950 --> 02:51:42,190
That sounds like a reasonable answer.

3737
02:51:47,130 --> 02:51:48,610
This can happen?

3738
02:51:53,910 --> 02:51:55,430
He doesn't have a wife.

3739
02:51:55,530 --> 02:51:56,390
Oh yes he does.

3740
02:51:56,630 --> 02:51:58,090
And this is a lucky man.

3741
02:51:58,870 --> 02:52:00,490
Have you seen his wife?

3742
02:52:01,310 --> 02:52:02,790
Good golly.

3743
02:52:03,550 --> 02:52:04,830
She's got...

3744
02:52:06,970 --> 02:52:09,290
And she also has...

3745
02:52:10,950 --> 02:52:14,550
And a ton of...

3746
02:52:15,970 --> 02:52:17,330
1-1-5-2.

3747
02:52:22,670 --> 02:52:23,550
Thank you guys.

3748
02:52:29,810 --> 02:52:31,130
Lois Stiltski speaking.

3749
02:52:31,750 --> 02:52:33,510
My husband is not at home.

3750
02:52:33,770 --> 02:52:34,830
Did he forget his hat?

3751
02:52:35,690 --> 02:52:36,430
His hat?

3752
02:52:36,590 --> 02:52:37,230
Yes, yes, yes.

3753
02:52:38,710 --> 02:52:40,010
Yes he left it here!

3754
02:52:43,770 --> 02:52:46,850
I almost... I almost sent you to die Roman.

3755
02:52:48,810 --> 02:52:50,310
I almost sent you to die.

3756
02:52:50,310 --> 02:52:52,050
Have a good day.

3757
02:53:00,230 --> 02:53:01,670
How many are left?

3758
02:53:05,410 --> 02:53:06,250
Peach man.

3759
02:53:08,850 --> 02:53:10,610
You me of stone.

3760
02:53:10,670 --> 02:53:12,470
I'm never watching La La Land again.

3761
02:53:15,430 --> 02:53:17,510
I'm never watching La La Land again.

3762
02:53:17,610 --> 02:53:19,390
I'm a La La Land auntie now.

3763
02:53:25,940 --> 02:53:26,500
Oops.

3764
02:53:30,650 --> 02:53:32,870
Everything about the appearance seems fine.

3765
02:53:34,150 --> 02:53:35,990
I don't know why I'm still carrying.

3766
02:53:36,110 --> 02:53:37,570
Maybe I'm hoping for a miracle.

3767
02:53:39,130 --> 02:53:41,390
Maybe I'm hoping for a miracle.

3768
02:53:43,990 --> 02:53:44,750
Something.

3769
02:53:44,750 --> 02:53:45,670
Go in.

3770
02:53:48,490 --> 02:53:49,750
Go in.

3771
02:53:50,210 --> 02:53:51,110
Go in.

3772
02:53:52,430 --> 02:53:53,190
Oh.

3773
02:53:53,190 --> 02:53:54,050
Oh.

3774
02:54:05,860 --> 02:54:06,340
Oh.

3775
02:54:06,340 --> 02:54:07,140
No date.

3776
02:54:11,180 --> 02:54:11,660
Bum

3777
02:54:18,210 --> 02:54:18,650
bum bum.

3778
02:54:18,730 --> 02:54:19,770
He fell down the stairs.

3779
02:54:21,650 --> 02:54:23,770
He left something in his car obviously.

3780
02:54:24,190 --> 02:54:25,910
He had to run out really fast.

3781
02:54:26,650 --> 02:54:27,590
Go grab it.

3782
02:54:29,150 --> 02:54:30,090
Bum bum bum.

3783
02:54:30,130 --> 02:54:30,850
Bum bum bum.

3784
02:54:31,090 --> 02:54:31,530
Bum bum bum.

3785
02:54:31,530 --> 02:54:32,010
Bum bum bum.

3786
02:54:32,370 --> 02:54:32,670
Bum bum bum.

3787
02:54:33,370 --> 02:54:34,290
Bum bum bum.

3788
02:54:35,910 --> 02:54:36,670
Bum bum bum.

3789
02:54:43,370 --> 02:54:43,870
Wait.

3790
02:54:43,870 --> 02:54:46,590
So I also let a guy in?

3791
02:54:52,490 --> 02:54:52,990
Wait.

3792
02:54:52,990 --> 02:54:52,990
So I also let a guy in?

3793
02:54:52,990 --> 02:54:53,810
Neighbors killed one.

3794
02:54:54,130 --> 02:54:54,250
Neighbors killed one.

3795
02:54:54,650 --> 02:54:55,150
Wait.

3796
02:54:55,230 --> 02:54:56,150
Who did I let in then?

3797
02:54:56,690 --> 02:54:57,190
Mia.

3798
02:54:57,190 --> 02:54:57,350
Mia.

3799
02:55:04,210 --> 02:55:05,410
Fake documents.

3800
02:55:08,050 --> 02:55:08,550
Mia.

3801
02:55:09,510 --> 02:55:12,290
Oh god the game is like starting to lag so bad.

3802
02:55:16,320 --> 02:55:18,200
I think we let in fake Mia.

3803
02:55:18,440 --> 02:55:18,700
I think we let in fake Mia.

3804
02:55:30,790 --> 02:55:31,270
Annoying!

3805
02:55:36,090 --> 02:55:37,050
So frustrating!

3806
02:55:38,190 --> 02:55:38,910
It's harder.

3807
02:55:39,110 --> 02:55:41,070
It's of course harder when you can't see the records.

3808
02:55:41,230 --> 02:55:44,490
But I mean honestly we did pretty good job for...

3809
02:55:44,490 --> 02:55:46,690
I think we just mixed up the Mias.

3810
02:55:48,890 --> 02:55:50,590
I think we just mixed up the Mias.

3811
02:55:50,870 --> 02:55:51,330
I think we just mixed up the Mias.

3812
02:55:51,330 --> 02:55:55,110
But we did a pretty good job for not having the records to be able to reference too.

3813
02:55:57,710 --> 02:56:00,210
I think we killed the correct Mia.

3814
02:56:00,210 --> 02:56:01,810
I think we killed the correct Mia.

3815
02:56:01,970 --> 02:56:02,490
I think we killed the correct Mia.

3816
02:56:02,510 --> 02:56:06,770
And we accidentally let in the bad Mia.

3817
02:56:07,010 --> 02:56:07,390
And we accidentally let in the bad Mia.

3818
02:56:07,710 --> 02:56:08,530
I think.

3819
02:56:13,430 --> 02:56:13,950
Haha.

3820
02:56:24,720 --> 02:56:35,320
Thank you guys for... Catching some... Some ghastly ghouls with me today.

3821
02:56:36,420 --> 02:56:39,420
Let's see, what achievements do we have left still?

3822
02:56:44,920 --> 02:56:46,040
There's no A?

3823
02:56:46,300 --> 02:56:47,520
There's only S and F?

3824
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:51,360
Oh yeah, Chester's quiz.

3825
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:54,800
40 playthroughs.

3826
02:56:57,640 --> 02:57:01,980
Which we did not survive the past couple ones.

3827
02:57:02,080 --> 02:57:02,580
That's okay.

3828
02:57:03,280 --> 02:57:04,660
Doppelganger red-handed.

3829
02:57:07,360 --> 02:57:08,620
Yeah, it's this one.

3830
02:57:08,660 --> 02:57:10,560
Survive without opening any folder.

3831
02:57:11,500 --> 02:57:12,100
Wait!

3832
02:57:13,140 --> 02:57:15,100
All we have to do is survive, right?

3833
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:17,640
So we kill all of them.

3834
02:57:19,220 --> 02:57:20,860
Doesn't that technically mean...

3835
02:57:22,940 --> 02:57:23,600
We'll survive?

3836
02:57:23,840 --> 02:57:26,600
I should have chosen a different username every time you said this stream.

3837
02:57:26,740 --> 02:57:27,480
I got jumped in.

3838
02:57:28,760 --> 02:57:29,200
Sorry.

3839
02:57:34,110 --> 02:57:34,890
That works?

3840
02:57:34,910 --> 02:57:35,310
It does?

3841
02:57:38,490 --> 02:57:40,230
We die if a doppel gets in.

3842
02:57:40,450 --> 02:57:41,530
Yeah, but if we just...

3843
02:57:42,310 --> 02:57:44,710
Don't let anybody in, then it should be fine.

3844
02:57:46,050 --> 02:57:46,490
Right?

3845
02:57:47,650 --> 02:57:48,270
You know what?

3846
02:57:48,350 --> 02:57:49,110
One more!

3847
02:57:49,210 --> 02:57:49,870
One more!

3848
02:57:50,410 --> 02:57:51,350
One more!

3849
02:57:51,470 --> 02:57:51,950
One more!

3850
02:57:53,510 --> 02:57:54,410
Let's try it.

3851
02:57:58,570 --> 02:57:59,890
Let's cheat the system.

3852
02:58:04,970 --> 02:58:06,210
Let's cheat the system.

3853
02:58:06,910 --> 02:58:09,230
This one should be fast because we're just killing everybody.

3854
02:58:11,350 --> 02:58:11,870
Blood!

3855
02:58:12,070 --> 02:58:12,450
Blood!

3856
02:58:12,690 --> 02:58:12,910
Blood!

3857
02:58:14,270 --> 02:58:14,790
Yes!

3858
02:58:14,790 --> 02:58:15,810
Death to you!

3859
02:58:18,570 --> 02:58:19,430
Oh wait!

3860
02:58:20,830 --> 02:58:23,150
If we can catch a guy red-handed...

3861
02:58:23,150 --> 02:58:24,950
That would also be another thing, right?

3862
02:58:28,670 --> 02:58:30,250
No, you seem safe though.

3863
02:58:43,480 --> 02:58:44,600
No survivors!

3864
02:58:48,480 --> 02:58:49,040
Kill!

3865
02:58:49,140 --> 02:58:49,460
Kill!

3866
02:58:49,640 --> 02:58:49,920
Kill!

3867
02:58:50,300 --> 02:58:50,860
Kill!

3868
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:51,360
Kill!

3869
02:58:51,480 --> 02:58:51,820
Kill!

3870
02:58:52,620 --> 02:58:53,180
Kill!

3871
02:58:53,360 --> 02:58:53,640
Kill!

3872
02:58:54,140 --> 02:58:54,700
Kill!

3873
02:58:54,700 --> 02:58:54,980
Kill!

3874
02:58:54,980 --> 02:58:55,120
Kill!

3875
02:58:55,340 --> 02:58:55,620
Kill!

3876
02:58:56,640 --> 02:58:57,200
Next!

3877
02:58:59,100 --> 02:58:59,660
Victim.

3878
02:59:00,440 --> 02:59:00,960
Yeah.

3879
02:59:02,180 --> 02:59:02,700
Milkman.

3880
02:59:04,140 --> 02:59:04,660
Hello.

3881
02:59:05,980 --> 02:59:06,500
Hello.

3882
02:59:08,440 --> 02:59:08,960
Francis.

3883
02:59:10,960 --> 02:59:12,640
You are on the list.

3884
02:59:14,720 --> 02:59:15,240
See?

3885
02:59:15,240 --> 02:59:16,280
That's his nose.

3886
02:59:16,960 --> 02:59:18,580
That's his nose, you guys.

3887
02:59:18,660 --> 02:59:21,120
The other nose had too much definition.

3888
02:59:21,180 --> 02:59:23,980
There was like little holes and stuff for him to breathe.

3889
02:59:24,280 --> 02:59:25,760
But he doesn't have those to breathe.

3890
02:59:25,820 --> 02:59:26,860
He's a mouth breather.

3891
02:59:38,690 --> 02:59:39,410
No logo?

3892
02:59:39,550 --> 02:59:40,090
It doesn't matter.

3893
02:59:40,190 --> 02:59:41,130
We're not gonna let him in anyway.

3894
02:59:42,930 --> 02:59:44,590
We're not letting in a single person.

3895
02:59:48,070 --> 02:59:49,110
Is this the...

3896
02:59:49,110 --> 02:59:51,970
Is this the milkman that Tumblr is going wild for?

3897
02:59:52,770 --> 02:59:53,830
What do you mean by that?

3898
02:59:56,050 --> 02:59:57,410
Is Tumblr still a thing?

3899
02:59:59,990 --> 03:00:00,870
Good afternoon.

3900
03:00:01,170 --> 03:00:01,690
Blah blah blah.

3901
03:00:02,510 --> 03:00:04,710
Doesn't this guy normally wear a hat anyway?

3902
03:00:07,810 --> 03:00:09,090
Is it because of my hat?

3903
03:00:09,170 --> 03:00:09,350
Yes!

3904
03:00:09,590 --> 03:00:10,110
Actually.

3905
03:00:13,630 --> 03:00:14,150
Oh.

3906
03:00:16,170 --> 03:00:17,530
I'm not gonna do that.

3907
03:00:33,870 --> 03:00:34,490
It's okay.

3908
03:00:34,550 --> 03:00:35,550
He lived a long life.

3909
03:00:41,490 --> 03:00:43,790
People are simping for the milkman.

3910
03:00:46,090 --> 03:00:46,970
No way.

3911
03:00:47,530 --> 03:00:48,490
Wait, actually?

3912
03:00:49,750 --> 03:00:50,270
Oh.

3913
03:00:50,270 --> 03:00:53,430
Her eye is going the wrong way.

3914
03:00:56,970 --> 03:00:58,530
She's also not on the list.

3915
03:01:02,570 --> 03:01:03,850
What's wrong with my appearance?

3916
03:01:05,910 --> 03:01:09,430
Look carefully at the photos of my papers and compare them well with me.

3917
03:01:10,450 --> 03:01:11,830
No, I want you to get hangry.

3918
03:01:11,970 --> 03:01:12,670
Get mad!

3919
03:01:16,570 --> 03:01:17,410
Get mad!

3920
03:01:20,130 --> 03:01:20,530
Okay.

3921
03:01:20,910 --> 03:01:21,670
You're boring.

3922
03:01:21,850 --> 03:01:22,470
Get out of here.

3923
03:01:28,830 --> 03:01:29,530
What did you say?

3924
03:01:30,730 --> 03:01:33,010
Maybe I clicked the button before she finished talking.

3925
03:01:36,470 --> 03:01:37,730
It kind of spooked me, though.

3926
03:01:38,390 --> 03:01:42,810
It kind of scared me when I shut it and she's like, look at the list again.

3927
03:01:43,450 --> 03:01:45,810
A lot of lewd fan art of him on Twitter!

3928
03:01:49,740 --> 03:01:50,400
That's crazy.

3929
03:01:54,060 --> 03:01:55,480
That's actually crazy.

3930
03:01:55,540 --> 03:01:55,760
Wait.

3931
03:01:56,020 --> 03:02:01,520
Is he on the sexy Tumblerman Tumblr website?

3932
03:02:05,260 --> 03:02:06,720
Good afternoon.

3933
03:02:07,700 --> 03:02:09,180
Good afternoon.

3934
03:02:10,020 --> 03:02:12,680
Good afternoon, Mr. Schmidt.

3935
03:02:14,100 --> 03:02:15,780
You have no stamp.

3936
03:02:16,580 --> 03:02:17,740
What's up with that?

3937
03:02:18,300 --> 03:02:19,100
Oh.

3938
03:02:24,330 --> 03:02:25,890
I am ruthless today.

3939
03:02:30,210 --> 03:02:32,570
Yes, but it's usually the other eye that is deviated.

3940
03:02:32,970 --> 03:02:33,370
Yeah.

3941
03:02:33,650 --> 03:02:34,810
No, I already said that.

3942
03:02:34,930 --> 03:02:36,910
As soon as she walked up, I recognized that.

3943
03:02:38,890 --> 03:02:39,810
I knew that already.

3944
03:02:40,250 --> 03:02:41,650
You guys are too slow.

3945
03:02:44,630 --> 03:02:46,530
It was her other eye that was opposite.

3946
03:02:46,730 --> 03:02:50,050
Why are you guys trying to correct me when I said that?

3947
03:02:53,450 --> 03:02:54,290
I'm confused.

3948
03:02:55,510 --> 03:02:57,390
Maybe I didn't word myself correctly.

3949
03:03:03,330 --> 03:03:04,690
I'm just going to...

3950
03:03:06,770 --> 03:03:08,190
Brian Rahm, welcome to membership.

3951
03:03:08,230 --> 03:03:08,870
Thank you.

3952
03:03:09,350 --> 03:03:11,110
They're correcting other people in chat.

3953
03:03:11,690 --> 03:03:12,270
Okay.

3954
03:03:16,190 --> 03:03:16,850
Oh, man.

3955
03:03:16,930 --> 03:03:17,650
The other eye is offset.

3956
03:03:18,390 --> 03:03:19,510
No way!

3957
03:03:20,450 --> 03:03:21,030
What?

3958
03:03:21,170 --> 03:03:22,370
They're bullshitting.

3959
03:03:24,230 --> 03:03:25,230
Anyway.

3960
03:03:39,960 --> 03:03:40,460
Skip.

3961
03:03:47,060 --> 03:03:48,520
Chat backseated themselves.

3962
03:03:52,160 --> 03:03:52,760
It's okay.

3963
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:53,980
I know.

3964
03:03:54,120 --> 03:03:55,700
This gets a little confusing.

3965
03:03:56,400 --> 03:03:56,960
Oh!

3966
03:03:58,040 --> 03:04:00,600
His nose is so wrong, actually.

3967
03:04:03,580 --> 03:04:05,240
Yeah, what's wrong with your appearance?

3968
03:04:06,800 --> 03:04:08,540
I look as handsome as ever!

3969
03:04:10,420 --> 03:04:11,580
You're so right.

3970
03:04:19,430 --> 03:04:20,910
I want his confidence.

3971
03:04:22,010 --> 03:04:24,210
I want his confidence for real.

3972
03:04:24,770 --> 03:04:26,030
He just has a cold.

3973
03:04:26,170 --> 03:04:27,430
He got stung by a bee.

3974
03:04:28,670 --> 03:04:29,470
I know!

3975
03:04:33,630 --> 03:04:34,410
Thank you!

3976
03:04:35,130 --> 03:04:37,190
You guys are putting in the work today.

3977
03:04:47,100 --> 03:04:47,620
Hello!

3978
03:04:49,560 --> 03:04:49,940
Hello!

3979
03:04:50,600 --> 03:04:51,120
Hello!

3980
03:04:51,280 --> 03:04:51,400
Hello!

3981
03:04:51,480 --> 03:04:51,580
Hello!

3982
03:04:52,140 --> 03:04:54,460
What is the meaning of life, universe and everything else?

3983
03:04:54,660 --> 03:04:55,180
42!

3984
03:04:59,100 --> 03:04:59,620
42!

3985
03:04:59,760 --> 03:05:00,100
42!

3986
03:05:00,840 --> 03:05:01,360
42!

3987
03:05:01,620 --> 03:05:01,840
42!

3988
03:05:04,100 --> 03:05:04,900
That is correct.

3989
03:05:06,340 --> 03:05:11,560
What is the scientific name of the Australian animal that drastically changes its appearance when removed from its natural habitat?

3990
03:05:11,820 --> 03:05:13,820
Why did Google tell me to get kidnapped?

3991
03:05:26,560 --> 03:05:27,140
Psi...Psi...Psi...Psi...

3992
03:05:32,200 --> 03:05:32,780
Chri...lo...ty...mar...sid...us...

3993
03:05:34,360 --> 03:05:34,940
I'm...I'm...I'm...

3994
03:05:38,900 --> 03:05:39,480
Psi...chri...lo...ty...mar...sid...us...

3995
03:05:40,900 --> 03:05:41,680
That's correct!

3996
03:05:41,800 --> 03:05:42,380
Good job guys!

3997
03:05:42,660 --> 03:05:51,320
What is the name of the only sport that allows you to punch your opponent in the face because they capture a piece?

3998
03:05:57,900 --> 03:05:58,460
Rugby?

3999
03:05:58,460 --> 03:05:59,440
Chess boxing?

4000
03:06:00,560 --> 03:06:01,120
What?

4001
03:06:01,200 --> 03:06:01,740
That's a thing?

4002
03:06:08,030 --> 03:06:08,870
That's correct!

4003
03:06:10,950 --> 03:06:21,210
At least how many times do you have to fold a 0.01mm thick sheet of paper to cover the distance between the Shire and Mordor?

4004
03:06:29,730 --> 03:06:30,250
38?

4005
03:06:30,250 --> 03:06:30,770
What?

4006
03:06:31,010 --> 03:06:32,350
What does that even mean?

4007
03:06:32,670 --> 03:06:40,890
Wait, how many times do you have to fold a 0.01mm thick sheet of paper to cover the distance between the Shire and Mordor?

4008
03:06:41,110 --> 03:06:42,170
What does that mean?

4009
03:06:42,170 --> 03:06:45,350
You have to fold it 38 times to...huh?

4010
03:06:51,040 --> 03:06:54,100
How many pages between mentions of the two, I guess?

4011
03:06:54,580 --> 03:06:55,980
Yeah, I don't really understand.

4012
03:06:56,360 --> 03:06:57,920
Every fold doubles the thickness.

4013
03:06:59,240 --> 03:07:00,360
Yeah, but...

4014
03:07:01,900 --> 03:07:03,800
Okay, I think I get it.

4015
03:07:03,960 --> 03:07:05,340
It's just not possible though.

4016
03:07:06,220 --> 03:07:06,960
That's correct!

4017
03:07:07,480 --> 03:07:08,460
Good job Google!

4018
03:07:09,340 --> 03:07:11,440
The key is...

4019
03:07:12,800 --> 03:07:13,360
Hide...

4020
03:07:14,660 --> 03:07:15,360
Wait, what?

4021
03:07:16,320 --> 03:07:18,320
Oh, I screenshot it because I thought it would...wait.

4022
03:07:20,700 --> 03:07:21,100
What?

4023
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:27,400
Uranus?

4024
03:07:29,880 --> 03:07:30,920
What does it mean though?

4025
03:07:31,060 --> 03:07:32,160
What does the cipher mean?

4026
03:07:33,680 --> 03:07:36,620
I like how you guys are just looking this up and spoon feeding it to me.

4027
03:07:36,860 --> 03:07:37,460
Thank you.

4028
03:07:40,400 --> 03:07:41,140
Thank you.

4029
03:07:43,060 --> 03:07:44,500
We're so smart today, guys.

4030
03:07:48,480 --> 03:07:49,340
That's correct!

4031
03:07:49,760 --> 03:07:50,640
Who would have thought?

4032
03:07:53,440 --> 03:07:54,840
How long is this quiz?

4033
03:07:55,620 --> 03:08:02,940
According to FSM Global Warming, it's a consequence of the fact that since the 19th century, the number of blank decrease.

4034
03:08:07,160 --> 03:08:07,780
Pirates?

4035
03:08:10,180 --> 03:08:10,800
Pirates?

4036
03:08:17,460 --> 03:08:17,850
Really?

4037
03:08:19,440 --> 03:08:20,620
That's correct!

4038
03:08:22,360 --> 03:08:24,720
You managed to answer all my questions correctly!

4039
03:08:24,940 --> 03:08:27,040
Congratulations, you have earned my badge!

4040
03:08:33,530 --> 03:08:35,090
Thank you!

4041
03:08:37,250 --> 03:08:37,650
Oh!

4042
03:08:39,230 --> 03:08:40,010
Goodbye!

4043
03:08:47,820 --> 03:08:48,860
All right!

4044
03:08:50,800 --> 03:08:51,580
MVP!

4045
03:08:53,750 --> 03:08:56,230
Except for when it's for me!

4046
03:08:56,830 --> 03:08:58,350
Because I googled it.

4047
03:08:58,350 --> 03:08:59,670
And it said Echidna.

4048
03:08:59,730 --> 03:09:01,150
Why did it say Echidna?

4049
03:09:02,470 --> 03:09:02,950
Why?

4050
03:09:03,090 --> 03:09:04,270
That does not make any sense!

4051
03:09:05,570 --> 03:09:08,830
I thought there was maybe something about the Echidna that I just didn't know.

4052
03:09:10,710 --> 03:09:11,670
I don't know.

4053
03:09:12,490 --> 03:09:14,290
Unless it was ChatGPT.

4054
03:09:14,990 --> 03:09:15,910
Who knows?

4055
03:09:18,930 --> 03:09:20,670
Bob Burger's looking ass down!

4056
03:09:24,890 --> 03:09:25,370
Um...

4057
03:09:26,430 --> 03:09:27,590
I think he's fine.

4058
03:09:27,590 --> 03:09:28,890
But we're just gonna call...

4059
03:09:28,890 --> 03:09:30,150
You know...

4060
03:09:32,950 --> 03:09:34,530
If I touch this thing...

4061
03:09:35,050 --> 03:09:36,450
Will I get diseased?

4062
03:09:37,890 --> 03:09:38,590
We'll figure...

4063
03:09:38,590 --> 03:09:39,650
We'll find out after...

4064
03:09:39,650 --> 03:09:41,990
If I touch this little thing he gave me...

4065
03:09:41,990 --> 03:09:43,570
That's a certified hot dog moment!

4066
03:09:43,670 --> 03:09:44,610
Can I get a hot dog?

4067
03:09:50,570 --> 03:09:51,450
Thank you!

4068
03:09:54,910 --> 03:09:55,790
Thank you!

4069
03:09:56,230 --> 03:09:56,810
Bye-bye!

4070
03:09:58,550 --> 03:09:59,030
Nope.

4071
03:09:59,150 --> 03:09:59,610
Doesn't...

4072
03:09:59,610 --> 03:10:00,750
Nothing happens if you click it.

4073
03:10:03,610 --> 03:10:04,090
Milkman!

4074
03:10:04,470 --> 03:10:04,750
Hello.

4075
03:10:09,550 --> 03:10:11,610
I forgot to show my entry request.

4076
03:10:12,330 --> 03:10:13,490
You're a milkman.

4077
03:10:17,330 --> 03:10:18,230
Thank you, Francis.

4078
03:10:20,110 --> 03:10:21,550
Oh my gosh, thank you for that!

4079
03:10:24,350 --> 03:10:27,070
Thank you, cat called Meowie.

4080
03:10:27,810 --> 03:10:28,690
Tips are free.

4081
03:10:28,690 --> 03:10:29,610
No, they're not!

4082
03:10:32,470 --> 03:10:33,550
No, they are not.

4083
03:10:34,770 --> 03:10:35,590
Thank you, though.

4084
03:10:38,230 --> 03:10:38,710
Um...

4085
03:10:40,690 --> 03:10:41,170
Um...

4086
03:10:46,690 --> 03:10:48,250
I think he was fine.

4087
03:10:48,410 --> 03:10:49,070
But who knows?

4088
03:10:51,190 --> 03:10:51,910
Oh my gosh.

4089
03:10:51,950 --> 03:10:53,010
Thank you for all the hot dogs!

4090
03:10:54,310 --> 03:10:54,790
Glizzy.

4091
03:10:54,950 --> 03:10:55,430
Overdrive.

4092
03:10:55,430 --> 03:10:55,450
Overdrive.

4093
03:10:55,970 --> 03:10:56,370
Overdrive.

4094
03:10:56,830 --> 03:10:57,230
Overdrive.

4095
03:10:57,650 --> 03:10:58,290
Thank you.

4096
03:10:58,910 --> 03:10:59,610
Oh my gosh.

4097
03:10:59,630 --> 03:11:02,050
After this, I have to go blow my nose for real.

4098
03:11:03,270 --> 03:11:04,270
I had the...

4099
03:11:04,270 --> 03:11:08,810
I had my door open today to kind of air out my maid cafe a little bit.

4100
03:11:09,250 --> 03:11:11,030
Because, you know, since I haven't been...

4101
03:11:11,570 --> 03:11:13,590
Since I haven't been living here...

4102
03:11:14,510 --> 03:11:18,670
For a while, it was a little stuffy.

4103
03:11:19,590 --> 03:11:19,990
Um...

4104
03:11:22,890 --> 03:11:23,290
Um...

4105
03:11:24,110 --> 03:11:24,510
Um...

4106
03:11:24,510 --> 03:11:25,010
Um...

4107
03:11:25,810 --> 03:11:27,650
But it let all the pollen in too.

4108
03:11:27,950 --> 03:11:29,310
So I'm like extra...

4109
03:11:30,090 --> 03:11:32,010
Extra stuffy and coffee today.

4110
03:11:34,550 --> 03:11:35,490
She's Tomie.

4111
03:11:37,250 --> 03:11:38,550
They are my arms.

4112
03:11:38,730 --> 03:11:40,490
Like the arms of a normal human.

4113
03:11:43,290 --> 03:11:44,790
She's so right.

4114
03:11:45,710 --> 03:11:47,050
You are so right.

4115
03:11:51,030 --> 03:11:51,730
That's fun.

4116
03:11:51,790 --> 03:11:52,750
We haven't seen that one before.

4117
03:11:58,730 --> 03:11:59,170
Sniffer.

4118
03:12:03,230 --> 03:12:04,110
Very natural.

4119
03:12:04,250 --> 03:12:04,870
Very human.

4120
03:12:05,270 --> 03:12:07,450
Actually, those kind of look like my hands, didn't they?

4121
03:12:10,250 --> 03:12:11,470
They kind of look like...

4122
03:12:12,250 --> 03:12:13,850
They kind of look like my hands.

4123
03:12:14,410 --> 03:12:15,650
When they're up, you know.

4124
03:12:18,230 --> 03:12:19,070
Good afternoon.

4125
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:33,960
Good afternoon.

4126
03:12:34,280 --> 03:12:36,940
Good afternoon.

4127
03:12:43,230 --> 03:12:45,910
Do I have to let you think like one person in?

4128
03:12:45,990 --> 03:12:48,250
Oh my god, my nose is so itchy!

4129
03:12:53,230 --> 03:12:54,670
Maybe she was a ghost too.

4130
03:12:54,850 --> 03:12:55,330
Maybe!

4131
03:12:57,850 --> 03:12:59,410
Maybe she like...

4132
03:12:59,410 --> 03:13:05,030
Maybe she was in the process of becoming a ghost, you know, she was dead and then she got brought back to life.

4133
03:13:05,870 --> 03:13:11,390
Imagine giving her a hug and then her neck arm hug your head too.

4134
03:13:11,730 --> 03:13:12,950
That's so romantic!

4135
03:13:15,390 --> 03:13:16,590
Good afternoon.

4136
03:13:18,130 --> 03:13:19,630
Where's your entry request?

4137
03:13:20,570 --> 03:13:21,650
Thank you.

4138
03:13:23,490 --> 03:13:25,050
McLouie Rudd Boys.

4139
03:13:31,820 --> 03:13:34,100
I think he's good, but it's fine.

4140
03:13:35,780 --> 03:13:36,260
Romance.

4141
03:13:36,820 --> 03:13:39,060
Just like what I think of when I see Italy.

4142
03:13:40,240 --> 03:13:40,720
Romance.

4143
03:13:44,240 --> 03:13:46,000
We're gonna cause a time paradox.

4144
03:13:51,340 --> 03:13:52,300
Thank you.

4145
03:13:58,280 --> 03:13:59,320
Yes, romance.

4146
03:13:59,480 --> 03:14:00,040
Exactly.

4147
03:14:07,380 --> 03:14:07,940
Yippee!

4148
03:14:10,540 --> 03:14:13,640
And we got five doppelgangers.

4149
03:14:13,680 --> 03:14:13,920
Nice.

4150
03:14:14,340 --> 03:14:17,080
We only killed seven people in the process too, but that's okay.

4151
03:14:18,200 --> 03:14:19,320
Rank C!

4152
03:14:22,780 --> 03:14:24,600
And we got a new record.

4153
03:14:24,920 --> 03:14:25,480
Right?

4154
03:14:26,420 --> 03:14:27,320
Which is...

4155
03:14:28,140 --> 03:14:28,740
Yeah!

4156
03:14:32,240 --> 03:14:34,160
I can't believe that worked.

4157
03:14:34,820 --> 03:14:35,420
Wow.

4158
03:14:37,940 --> 03:14:38,540
Wow.

4159
03:14:41,440 --> 03:14:44,400
We actually managed to unlock so many of these.

4160
03:14:46,860 --> 03:14:49,280
Obviously the hundred one is gonna be really difficult.

4161
03:14:50,860 --> 03:14:52,060
Forty playthroughs.

4162
03:14:52,260 --> 03:14:53,340
Unlock all achievements.

4163
03:14:53,700 --> 03:14:56,280
The peach doppelganger and the doppelganger red hair?

4164
03:14:56,280 --> 03:14:56,660
I don't understand it.

4165
03:14:59,340 --> 03:15:02,220
Actually, if you are interested in playing this game too, it is free.

4166
03:15:02,800 --> 03:15:08,360
There is like a download version that costs three dollars, I think.

4167
03:15:08,620 --> 03:15:09,860
So it's very inexpensive.

4168
03:15:10,240 --> 03:15:12,540
And then there's also a free browser version.

4169
03:15:13,020 --> 03:15:13,720
Dust go!

4170
03:15:14,840 --> 03:15:15,920
Welcome to membership.

4171
03:15:16,080 --> 03:15:16,840
Thank you!

4172
03:15:21,300 --> 03:15:21,840
So...

4173
03:15:22,520 --> 03:15:23,060
Yeah.

4174
03:15:23,340 --> 03:15:24,360
You can...

4175
03:15:25,680 --> 03:15:29,180
You can play it for free in the online version.

4176
03:15:29,280 --> 03:15:30,000
Just search up...

4177
03:15:30,000 --> 03:15:31,280
That's not my neighbor.

4178
03:15:31,460 --> 03:15:32,880
And you will be able to find it.

4179
03:15:32,980 --> 03:15:34,440
If you are interested in playing it as well.

4180
03:15:34,500 --> 03:15:35,140
Because it is pretty fun.

4181
03:15:36,260 --> 03:15:39,540
Look, we have already captured thirty one doppelgangers.

4182
03:15:42,300 --> 03:15:43,100
That's not so bad.

4183
03:15:43,840 --> 03:15:44,800
What was the...

4184
03:15:44,800 --> 03:15:45,840
How many was it?

4185
03:15:45,940 --> 03:15:46,520
Like a hundred?

4186
03:15:47,020 --> 03:15:47,640
A hundred!

4187
03:15:48,120 --> 03:15:49,880
We are already thirty percent of the way there.

4188
03:15:51,100 --> 03:15:52,020
It's not so bad.

4189
03:15:52,020 --> 03:15:52,640
Yeah, it's not so bad.

4190
03:15:55,120 --> 03:15:56,500
Megafishnet, thank you!

4191
03:15:56,940 --> 03:15:58,020
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

4192
03:15:58,800 --> 03:15:59,580
Welcome back.

4193
03:16:01,680 --> 03:16:02,900
And sent thirty...

4194
03:16:02,900 --> 03:16:04,340
Shh, we don't look at that part.

4195
03:16:04,740 --> 03:16:05,980
We don't look at this one.

4196
03:16:07,620 --> 03:16:09,120
In fact, I'm gonna...

4197
03:16:09,120 --> 03:16:11,840
Actually, we have only sent one neighbor.

4198
03:16:12,080 --> 03:16:13,440
We've only killed one neighbor.

4199
03:16:14,580 --> 03:16:16,000
Yeah, no worries.

4200
03:16:17,440 --> 03:16:19,080
No worries at all.

4201
03:16:25,950 --> 03:16:26,810
Well, that was good.

4202
03:16:26,850 --> 03:16:29,310
I'm glad that we could get those last two achievements then, right?

4203
03:16:29,890 --> 03:16:30,690
Very good stream.

4204
03:16:30,790 --> 03:16:31,410
I hope you're doing well.

4205
03:16:31,490 --> 03:16:32,010
Thanks, Robert!

4206
03:16:32,310 --> 03:16:32,950
Thank you!

4207
03:16:34,910 --> 03:16:35,810
Thank you, thank you.

4208
03:16:36,170 --> 03:16:37,170
This is so fun.

4209
03:16:37,590 --> 03:16:38,690
Andrew, welcome to the membership.

4210
03:16:38,770 --> 03:16:39,110
Thank you!

4211
03:16:39,330 --> 03:16:40,630
Thank you for the twenty!

4212
03:16:40,770 --> 03:16:41,190
Gifted!

4213
03:16:41,190 --> 03:16:41,710
Thank you!

4214
03:16:42,370 --> 03:16:43,210
I have to...

4215
03:16:43,210 --> 03:16:44,150
I think...

4216
03:16:45,570 --> 03:16:47,130
My next day off...

4217
03:16:48,610 --> 03:16:50,570
I will search for like...

4218
03:16:51,110 --> 03:16:52,410
Artists and stuff for...

4219
03:16:52,410 --> 03:16:53,230
My...

4220
03:16:53,230 --> 03:16:55,130
For emotes and everything.

4221
03:16:57,570 --> 03:16:59,890
See who's open for...

4222
03:17:00,470 --> 03:17:00,910
For...

4223
03:17:00,910 --> 03:17:01,550
For...

4224
03:17:04,150 --> 03:17:04,830
What's the word?

4225
03:17:05,990 --> 03:17:06,430
Commissions!

4226
03:17:07,110 --> 03:17:07,550
So...

4227
03:17:08,050 --> 03:17:08,270
Yeah.

4228
03:17:08,830 --> 03:17:10,670
I will look into that.

4229
03:17:10,910 --> 03:17:11,990
My name is Jeff.

4230
03:17:12,170 --> 03:17:13,210
10 out of 10 stream.

4231
03:17:13,770 --> 03:17:14,870
Well, thank you, Jeff.

4232
03:17:15,050 --> 03:17:16,290
I'm glad you liked it.

4233
03:17:16,890 --> 03:17:18,470
First time ever seeing this game.

4234
03:17:18,530 --> 03:17:18,870
It was fun.

4235
03:17:18,930 --> 03:17:19,850
I hope you had a good rest of the day.

4236
03:17:19,890 --> 03:17:21,030
Thank you, Merlin!

4237
03:17:21,150 --> 03:17:21,630
Thank you!

4238
03:17:21,630 --> 03:17:21,810
Thank you!

4239
03:17:21,930 --> 03:17:22,890
Yeah, I...

4240
03:17:23,790 --> 03:17:24,190
I...

4241
03:17:24,190 --> 03:17:25,170
Was really...

4242
03:17:25,170 --> 03:17:26,710
I saw this like a ton...

4243
03:17:28,210 --> 03:17:31,390
On YouTube and TikTok when I was in Japan.

4244
03:17:31,650 --> 03:17:32,650
And so I was like...

4245
03:17:32,650 --> 03:17:38,810
Trying not to watch so much of it because I obviously wanted to play for myself and I didn't want to be so...

4246
03:17:40,370 --> 03:17:40,770
Spoiled.

4247
03:17:40,790 --> 03:17:41,670
I'm kind of like...

4248
03:17:42,150 --> 03:17:43,470
I don't want to call them anomalies.

4249
03:17:43,490 --> 03:17:44,990
What kind of doppelgangers you can get, right?

4250
03:17:45,270 --> 03:17:46,250
Thanks for the stream, Mint!

4251
03:17:46,270 --> 03:17:48,870
Unless you're not Mint and you're a doppelganger.

4252
03:17:48,870 --> 03:17:51,090
Then please give us Mint back.

4253
03:17:53,850 --> 03:17:54,590
Here, hold on.

4254
03:17:55,630 --> 03:17:56,130
Hold on.

4255
03:17:57,710 --> 03:17:58,270
Let's see.

4256
03:17:58,350 --> 03:17:58,830
Let's see.

4257
03:17:59,130 --> 03:18:01,470
Let's see if you can tell if I'm a doppelganger or not.

4258
03:18:02,050 --> 03:18:02,410
Okay?

4259
03:18:03,910 --> 03:18:04,450
Let's see.

4260
03:18:06,630 --> 03:18:06,990
Hmm...

4261
03:18:10,150 --> 03:18:10,670
Oh, wait.

4262
03:18:10,770 --> 03:18:11,270
Hold on.

4263
03:18:14,030 --> 03:18:16,090
Let's see if you can tell if I'm a doppelganger or not.

4264
03:18:22,050 --> 03:18:22,610
Okay.

4265
03:18:22,730 --> 03:18:23,390
I'm gonna come in.

4266
03:18:23,490 --> 03:18:24,910
You're gonna tell me if I'm a doppelganger.

4267
03:18:30,200 --> 03:18:30,760
Hello!

4268
03:18:33,040 --> 03:18:33,600
Hello!

4269
03:18:39,010 --> 03:18:40,050
Am I normal?

4270
03:18:42,690 --> 03:18:43,730
Am I normal?

4271
03:18:45,530 --> 03:18:46,090
Sos?

4272
03:18:46,870 --> 03:18:47,430
Sos?

4273
03:18:49,090 --> 03:18:49,650
Where?

4274
03:18:49,770 --> 03:18:50,010
Why?

4275
03:18:50,210 --> 03:18:50,830
Why Sos?

4276
03:18:53,470 --> 03:18:54,030
Actually...

4277
03:18:54,030 --> 03:18:54,350
Here...

4278
03:18:54,350 --> 03:18:54,910
Um...

4279
03:18:56,110 --> 03:18:58,150
Let's actually move over to...

4280
03:18:59,890 --> 03:19:00,530
Here.

4281
03:19:03,110 --> 03:19:04,310
I'm gonna exit out of the game.

4282
03:19:04,510 --> 03:19:06,610
So we don't get this creepy music anymore.

4283
03:19:08,890 --> 03:19:09,530
Um...

4284
03:19:10,270 --> 03:19:11,910
Put on some music.

4285
03:19:13,490 --> 03:19:14,770
Some music.

4286
03:19:33,170 --> 03:19:33,690
There we go.

4287
03:19:36,170 --> 03:19:36,810
Sos?

4288
03:19:36,890 --> 03:19:37,670
Double mated?

4289
03:19:37,670 --> 03:19:37,750
Double mated?

4290
03:19:40,310 --> 03:19:41,710
Then you send me...

4291
03:19:41,710 --> 03:19:42,630
Then you call...

4292
03:19:42,630 --> 03:19:45,990
You call the police on me and I get flushed down the toilet.

4293
03:19:46,910 --> 03:19:47,330
No!

4294
03:19:51,450 --> 03:19:51,890
Okay.

4295
03:19:51,910 --> 03:19:52,710
Let me try one other one.

4296
03:19:53,130 --> 03:19:53,570
Oh!

4297
03:19:54,390 --> 03:19:55,870
Let me try another one.

4298
03:19:57,550 --> 03:19:58,150
Let's see.

4299
03:19:58,190 --> 03:19:58,550
Let's see.

4300
03:19:58,550 --> 03:19:58,870
Let's see.

4301
03:20:01,510 --> 03:20:01,950
Um...

4302
03:20:03,510 --> 03:20:03,950
I...

4303
03:20:05,770 --> 03:20:06,210
Um...

4304
03:20:07,550 --> 03:20:07,990
Um...

4305
03:20:11,310 --> 03:20:11,790
Um...

4306
03:20:13,670 --> 03:20:15,230
That one was too easy.

4307
03:20:18,050 --> 03:20:18,530
Oh...

4308
03:20:18,530 --> 03:20:18,610
Oh...

4309
03:20:18,610 --> 03:20:18,870
Oh...

4310
03:20:18,870 --> 03:20:19,110
Oh...

4311
03:20:19,110 --> 03:20:19,450
Oh...

4312
03:20:19,450 --> 03:20:19,670
Oh...

4313
03:20:19,670 --> 03:20:20,050
Oh...

4314
03:20:20,050 --> 03:20:20,170
Oh...

4315
03:20:20,170 --> 03:20:20,450
Oh...

4316
03:20:20,450 --> 03:20:20,670
Oh...

4317
03:20:20,670 --> 03:20:20,750
Oh...

4318
03:20:20,750 --> 03:20:20,850
Oh...

4319
03:20:20,850 --> 03:20:21,650
This one.

4320
03:20:21,750 --> 03:20:22,030
This one.

4321
03:20:22,070 --> 03:20:22,310
This one.

4322
03:20:22,390 --> 03:20:22,510
This one.

4323
03:20:22,630 --> 03:20:24,030
You'll never get it.

4324
03:20:24,050 --> 03:20:24,890
You'll never know.

4325
03:20:25,110 --> 03:20:26,070
You'll never know.

4326
03:20:30,780 --> 03:20:31,260
Okay.

4327
03:20:31,280 --> 03:20:31,460
Ready?

4328
03:20:54,400 --> 03:20:54,880
Unchanged.

4329
03:20:54,880 --> 03:20:55,700
This is normal.

4330
03:20:57,280 --> 03:20:58,220
That's what I'm saying.

4331
03:20:58,940 --> 03:20:59,420
Okay.

4332
03:21:00,720 --> 03:21:01,120
Alright?

4333
03:21:01,320 --> 03:21:02,140
You don't know.

4334
03:21:04,080 --> 03:21:05,040
You don't know.

4335
03:21:10,050 --> 03:21:11,350
Okay, I'm gonna give you another one.

4336
03:21:12,550 --> 03:21:12,950
But...

4337
03:21:13,690 --> 03:21:14,710
You have to tell me.

4338
03:21:14,910 --> 03:21:16,450
You have to figure it out.

4339
03:21:17,770 --> 03:21:18,370
This one?

4340
03:21:19,190 --> 03:21:19,850
Is normal.

4341
03:21:20,270 --> 03:21:20,670
Or?

4342
03:21:22,230 --> 03:21:22,990
Wait, okay, no.

4343
03:21:23,130 --> 03:21:23,670
This one?

4344
03:21:23,830 --> 03:21:25,370
Okay, figure out which one is normal.

4345
03:21:25,670 --> 03:21:26,290
This one?

4346
03:21:28,730 --> 03:21:29,130
Or...

4347
03:21:34,240 --> 03:21:36,000
This one?

4348
03:21:38,460 --> 03:21:39,460
Which one?

4349
03:21:48,530 --> 03:21:50,650
Yes, I'm a very dignified gentleman.

4350
03:21:53,930 --> 03:21:55,330
It's getting in my eyes.

4351
03:21:57,290 --> 03:21:58,490
It's itchy.

4352
03:22:01,750 --> 03:22:03,150
Why is it so wiggly?

4353
03:22:07,430 --> 03:22:08,370
There we go.

4354
03:22:10,870 --> 03:22:12,070
What is this?

4355
03:22:12,070 --> 03:22:14,870
What do I make it bigger?

4356
03:22:15,730 --> 03:22:20,300
Like this.

4357
03:22:22,780 --> 03:22:24,540
This is peak...

4358
03:22:24,540 --> 03:22:28,540
This is what every man should strive to be.

4359
03:22:29,840 --> 03:22:31,300
This is peak...

4360
03:22:34,880 --> 03:22:35,760
Masculinity.

4361
03:22:37,940 --> 03:22:39,260
Peak normal.

4362
03:22:41,880 --> 03:22:42,320
Robotnik.

4363
03:22:44,320 --> 03:22:47,580
This is mine!

4364
03:22:48,140 --> 03:22:50,120
Oh, I need an eye patch.

4365
03:22:50,560 --> 03:22:52,060
No, a monocle.

4366
03:22:54,200 --> 03:22:57,480
There are so many things here that are fun to use.

4367
03:22:58,840 --> 03:23:00,400
Let's see what else we got in here.

4368
03:23:04,700 --> 03:23:05,140
What?

4369
03:23:06,940 --> 03:23:08,120
There's boba in here too.

4370
03:23:08,260 --> 03:23:09,180
Hold on, I want to try it.

4371
03:23:10,780 --> 03:23:11,220
Woah!

4372
03:23:14,280 --> 03:23:15,660
How does this work?

4373
03:23:20,840 --> 03:23:21,620
Yummy!

4374
03:23:22,480 --> 03:23:23,260
Wait...

4375
03:23:23,780 --> 03:23:25,440
I can hold it in my hands.

4376
03:23:25,920 --> 03:23:26,700
Right?

4377
03:23:29,080 --> 03:23:29,860
Woah!

4378
03:23:31,380 --> 03:23:32,160
Wow!

4379
03:23:36,170 --> 03:23:37,330
Look at me!

4380
03:23:37,510 --> 03:23:39,230
I got my bubble tea!

4381
03:23:40,410 --> 03:23:41,190
Wow!

4382
03:23:41,510 --> 03:23:42,750
It's so fancy!

4383
03:23:43,710 --> 03:23:44,870
Oh my god.

4384
03:23:49,610 --> 03:23:50,310
Oh my gosh.

4385
03:23:52,150 --> 03:23:53,770
We have the technology.

4386
03:23:54,450 --> 03:23:55,810
Wow, this is so cool!

4387
03:23:56,330 --> 03:23:57,170
What does it say?

4388
03:23:57,250 --> 03:23:57,630
Boba?

4389
03:23:57,730 --> 03:23:58,050
Tea?

4390
03:23:58,150 --> 03:23:58,570
Coffee?

4391
03:24:06,250 --> 03:24:06,770
Oh!

4392
03:24:06,810 --> 03:24:07,730
Like BTS!

4393
03:24:08,590 --> 03:24:09,430
Vtube Studio!

4394
03:24:09,910 --> 03:24:10,990
Oh my gosh, that's so cute!

4395
03:24:13,430 --> 03:24:15,070
Vtube Studio is great, right?

4396
03:24:15,250 --> 03:24:15,450
Yeah!

4397
03:24:16,310 --> 03:24:17,330
Oh my gosh.

4398
03:24:17,330 --> 03:24:17,410
Oh my gosh.

4399
03:24:22,690 --> 03:24:23,170
Yippee!

4400
03:24:26,370 --> 03:24:27,650
That's kind of drippy though.

4401
03:24:27,790 --> 03:24:28,790
It's getting my sleeves wet.

4402
03:24:30,130 --> 03:24:31,250
Can we have a sippy too?

4403
03:24:33,070 --> 03:24:33,730
Drink up!

4404
03:24:35,850 --> 03:24:37,170
Here, I'll put it in the sand.

4405
03:24:38,510 --> 03:24:39,150
Here, I'll put it in the sand.

4406
03:24:39,390 --> 03:24:40,650
I'm feeding you.

4407
03:24:44,610 --> 03:24:45,090
Suckle.

4408
03:24:45,290 --> 03:24:46,570
Suckle from the straw.

4409
03:24:48,910 --> 03:24:50,870
See if you can catch it.

4410
03:24:51,090 --> 03:24:52,870
Only the strongest will survive.

4411
03:24:55,770 --> 03:24:56,570
Come on!

4412
03:24:56,690 --> 03:24:57,450
Come on!

4413
03:25:05,810 --> 03:25:09,910
If you can't get it, you won't live to see another day!

4414
03:25:14,370 --> 03:25:15,990
I am trying!

4415
03:25:16,610 --> 03:25:17,210
I am trying!

4416
03:25:17,210 --> 03:25:19,310
I am trying!

4417
03:25:19,310 --> 03:25:19,930
What else is there?

4418
03:25:20,090 --> 03:25:20,450
Let's see.

4419
03:25:25,610 --> 03:25:26,570
There's also these!

4420
03:25:27,370 --> 03:25:28,570
Will these look good on me though?

4421
03:25:28,650 --> 03:25:29,070
I wonder.

4422
03:25:30,350 --> 03:25:31,130
Okay, I'm gonna try.

4423
03:25:32,690 --> 03:25:33,050
Wait.

4424
03:25:34,230 --> 03:25:35,050
I'm gonna disappear.

4425
03:25:37,970 --> 03:25:38,870
Wait, I'm confused.

4426
03:25:39,810 --> 03:25:40,170
Actually.

4427
03:25:43,230 --> 03:25:44,150
Wait, hold on.

4428
03:25:44,570 --> 03:25:45,770
Why is it just...

4429
03:25:46,370 --> 03:25:47,050
Wait, hold on.

4430
03:25:49,010 --> 03:25:49,970
I'm confused.

4431
03:25:56,010 --> 03:25:57,130
I'm confused.

4432
03:25:58,090 --> 03:25:58,730
Oh!

4433
03:25:59,550 --> 03:26:00,530
There we go.

4434
03:26:06,330 --> 03:26:06,970
Okay.

4435
03:26:07,110 --> 03:26:08,050
You guys ready?

4436
03:26:10,230 --> 03:26:11,290
You guys ready?

4437
03:26:27,060 --> 03:26:28,820
This one's kind of...

4438
03:26:28,820 --> 03:26:30,460
Well, maybe it's just the angle.

4439
03:26:36,750 --> 03:26:37,710
What do you think?

4440
03:26:37,850 --> 03:26:38,010
What do you think?

4441
03:26:39,390 --> 03:26:41,070
This would've been perfect for Easter.

4442
03:26:41,390 --> 03:26:41,590
This would've been perfect for Easter.

4443
03:26:41,730 --> 03:26:42,570
Too bad I...

4444
03:26:42,570 --> 03:26:45,790
Too bad we announced everything the day after.

4445
03:26:46,130 --> 03:26:46,470
Too bad we announced everything the day after.

4446
03:26:53,030 --> 03:26:53,490
Bonnie.

4447
03:26:57,410 --> 03:26:58,230
Bonnie, Bonnie.

4448
03:27:03,850 --> 03:27:04,310
Uh...

4449
03:27:04,850 --> 03:27:08,030
You probably won't have to worry about this, but it could be an idea how to placeholder...

4450
03:27:08,030 --> 03:27:09,850
placeholder emotes while looking for a placeholder.

4451
03:27:09,870 --> 03:27:12,230
But I think you'll have plenty of members for months.

4452
03:27:12,310 --> 03:27:13,070
Not worry about it.

4453
03:27:13,130 --> 03:27:13,850
Oh, that's a good idea.

4454
03:27:14,010 --> 03:27:14,830
That's a good point though.

4455
03:27:15,410 --> 03:27:15,970
Because yeah.

4456
03:27:18,010 --> 03:27:18,490
You're right.

4457
03:27:18,530 --> 03:27:19,130
I might lose them.

4458
03:27:19,550 --> 03:27:20,550
I might lose them.

4459
03:27:21,050 --> 03:27:21,850
Thank you!

4460
03:27:23,050 --> 03:27:23,630
Thank you!

4461
03:27:27,590 --> 03:27:31,350
I like how when I blink, they move.

4462
03:27:32,790 --> 03:27:33,870
That's so fancy.

4463
03:27:33,970 --> 03:27:34,630
The technology.

4464
03:27:35,870 --> 03:27:37,190
The technology is real.

4465
03:27:39,390 --> 03:27:41,730
And they also like, flop back and forth.

4466
03:27:45,150 --> 03:27:45,830
Yay!

4467
03:27:49,350 --> 03:27:50,430
Too cute.

4468
03:27:51,730 --> 03:27:52,730
So cute.

4469
03:27:56,650 --> 03:28:01,970
Yeah, I'll probably find a couple artists that can do some...

4470
03:28:02,730 --> 03:28:03,830
some stuff.

4471
03:28:04,350 --> 03:28:05,330
So that...

4472
03:28:06,210 --> 03:28:06,730
Uh...

4473
03:28:06,730 --> 03:28:09,790
I'm not stressing one artist out with 37...

4474
03:28:10,850 --> 03:28:11,890
37 slots.

4475
03:28:12,690 --> 03:28:13,210
Um...

4476
03:28:13,210 --> 03:28:14,390
Or however many it was.

4477
03:28:15,530 --> 03:28:17,030
It was 37, wasn't it?

4478
03:28:17,110 --> 03:28:19,050
Or did I just see that in chat and believed it?

4479
03:28:20,630 --> 03:28:22,450
37 copies of Bustin'?

4480
03:28:24,330 --> 03:28:24,850
Yes.

4481
03:28:26,910 --> 03:28:27,950
Dr. Cornelius.

4482
03:28:27,950 --> 03:28:28,550
Thank you for membership!

4483
03:28:28,930 --> 03:28:30,010
God Hand, thank you for membership!

4484
03:28:30,010 --> 03:28:31,930
Ah, God Hand.

4485
03:28:35,750 --> 03:28:37,330
37, you counted them yourself.

4486
03:28:37,670 --> 03:28:37,850
Okay.

4487
03:28:38,570 --> 03:28:40,670
Welcome to membership, thank you!

4488
03:28:40,850 --> 03:28:41,450
38?

4489
03:28:43,800 --> 03:28:45,470
37 colors of Bustin'.

4490
03:28:45,470 --> 03:28:47,650
Oh my gosh, we just make it a full spectrum?

4491
03:28:48,190 --> 03:28:49,310
That would be crazy.

4492
03:28:50,730 --> 03:28:52,810
It's like a full rainbow spectrum.

4493
03:28:53,190 --> 03:28:55,090
Like every individual color.

4494
03:28:55,250 --> 03:28:58,230
You can think of 37 stab wounds!

4495
03:29:01,310 --> 03:29:01,830
Yeah.

4496
03:29:02,730 --> 03:29:03,250
Hmm...

4497
03:29:04,590 --> 03:29:06,050
Well guys, this was fun.

4498
03:29:06,830 --> 03:29:08,790
Thank you for hanging out with me today.

4499
03:29:09,550 --> 03:29:13,290
Thank you for understanding when I was just like...

4500
03:29:13,290 --> 03:29:19,090
Part of me for Tomodachi life I was like, obviously I can put in like some...

4501
03:29:20,350 --> 03:29:21,570
Some... what's the word?

4502
03:29:22,070 --> 03:29:23,410
Like fictional characters.

4503
03:29:23,590 --> 03:29:26,390
We can put in like video game characters, anime characters, whoever we want.

4504
03:29:28,810 --> 03:29:29,690
But for...

4505
03:29:30,190 --> 03:29:31,390
Or even like celebrities.

4506
03:29:31,870 --> 03:29:33,310
You know, just be goofy.

4507
03:29:33,670 --> 03:29:35,810
But for some of the people that I was just like...

4508
03:29:35,810 --> 03:29:37,810
Oh, like you know...

4509
03:29:39,430 --> 03:29:39,870
For...

4510
03:29:39,870 --> 03:29:43,770
Other people that I might know personally if I wanted to put them in.

4511
03:29:44,110 --> 03:29:45,710
I wanted to...

4512
03:29:46,870 --> 03:29:47,510
Thank you!

4513
03:29:47,970 --> 03:29:50,250
I wanted to make sure I ask for like...

4514
03:29:50,250 --> 03:29:51,310
You know, permission.

4515
03:29:52,090 --> 03:29:53,470
You know, like I want to be like...

4516
03:29:53,470 --> 03:29:55,450
I don't want to just put them in the game and they...

4517
03:29:56,850 --> 03:29:57,430
You know.

4518
03:29:58,230 --> 03:29:59,390
I was just like...

4519
03:29:59,390 --> 03:30:01,830
I thought about it like kind of...

4520
03:30:02,370 --> 03:30:03,730
Like really only today.

4521
03:30:03,870 --> 03:30:05,110
So I was like, oh shoot.

4522
03:30:06,130 --> 03:30:08,510
Not that I have like so many people that I would include.

4523
03:30:08,730 --> 03:30:12,850
But just in case anybody that I know that...

4524
03:30:14,190 --> 03:30:15,290
I might include.

4525
03:30:17,010 --> 03:30:17,450
Yeah.

4526
03:30:17,570 --> 03:30:19,550
I just want to make sure that they are okay with it.

4527
03:30:22,050 --> 03:30:24,110
Before I add them in.

4528
03:30:26,550 --> 03:30:28,030
Like Matara, yeah.

4529
03:30:29,270 --> 03:30:29,950
No.

4530
03:30:30,050 --> 03:30:32,050
I'm never asking if she's comfortable.

4531
03:30:32,290 --> 03:30:34,430
I want her to be as uncomfortable as possible.

4532
03:30:34,610 --> 03:30:35,870
All the time.

4533
03:30:38,770 --> 03:30:39,450
Okay.

4534
03:30:39,830 --> 03:30:42,310
Tomorrow will probably be a bit of a longer stream.

4535
03:30:42,370 --> 03:30:42,930
Because...

4536
03:30:43,890 --> 03:30:45,330
It's Metal Gear!

4537
03:30:45,650 --> 03:30:46,330
Yippee!

4538
03:30:47,830 --> 03:30:49,630
Mint the rabbit hole animation.

4539
03:30:50,490 --> 03:30:51,170
Hmm?

4540
03:30:55,170 --> 03:30:55,650
Hmm?

4541
03:30:57,610 --> 03:30:58,470
Rabbit hole?

4542
03:31:01,550 --> 03:31:03,270
Yeah, I'll be playing Twin Snakes tomorrow.

4543
03:31:03,790 --> 03:31:05,290
For the first time ever.

4544
03:31:05,490 --> 03:31:07,050
So I'm nervous.

4545
03:31:07,430 --> 03:31:09,010
If I'm bad, I'm sorry.

4546
03:31:09,270 --> 03:31:11,930
I haven't played Metal Gear in quite some time.

4547
03:31:12,330 --> 03:31:12,930
So...

4548
03:31:13,930 --> 03:31:14,870
But uh...

4549
03:31:16,110 --> 03:31:16,710
We...

4550
03:31:16,710 --> 03:31:17,670
Will...

4551
03:31:17,670 --> 03:31:19,150
Have fun regardless.

4552
03:31:19,570 --> 03:31:21,030
Oh, the Miko MV!

4553
03:31:22,090 --> 03:31:23,170
Do do do.

4554
03:31:25,810 --> 03:31:26,970
Yeah yeah yeah.

4555
03:31:27,230 --> 03:31:27,670
I know it.

4556
03:31:28,070 --> 03:31:30,510
Yes yes yes.

4557
03:31:30,690 --> 03:31:32,150
I forgot what it was called.

4558
03:31:33,610 --> 03:31:34,510
Big ham.

4559
03:31:34,910 --> 03:31:35,870
Welcome to membership.

4560
03:31:36,010 --> 03:31:36,470
Thank you!

4561
03:31:37,410 --> 03:31:38,150
But yeah.

4562
03:31:38,310 --> 03:31:39,830
So Metal Gear tomorrow.

4563
03:31:40,310 --> 03:31:41,950
The hype.

4564
03:31:42,810 --> 03:31:44,090
So excited to play it.

4565
03:31:44,150 --> 03:31:45,190
Twin Snakes.

4566
03:31:45,390 --> 03:31:45,990
Finally.

4567
03:31:47,270 --> 03:31:48,250
And um...

4568
03:31:48,250 --> 03:31:54,010
Yeah, probably will be a bit of a longer stream so that I can get through a good amount of it.

4569
03:31:55,410 --> 03:31:58,930
And I will make sure I... well, hopefully I will get enough sleep tonight.

4570
03:32:01,450 --> 03:32:01,890
Hopefully.

4571
03:32:10,490 --> 03:32:11,370
Thank you!

4572
03:32:11,630 --> 03:32:12,870
Thank you, thank you!

4573
03:32:13,590 --> 03:32:14,890
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

4574
03:32:14,950 --> 03:32:16,650
I will see you guys tomorrow!

4575
03:32:19,810 --> 03:32:20,590
Bye bye!

4576
03:32:21,750 --> 03:32:23,630
Oh, we can do Bustin'.

4577
03:32:23,630 --> 03:32:25,570
Actually, it's so funny.

4578
03:32:26,190 --> 03:32:30,770
Yesterday I watched a trailer of an anime and I got bonked.

4579
03:32:30,950 --> 03:32:32,910
So the stream got demonetized.

4580
03:32:34,730 --> 03:32:43,610
The stream got demonetized because they were like, you showed the trailer and you also watched it.

4581
03:32:43,710 --> 03:32:48,590
So I have to be careful about that kind of stuff, I suppose.

4582
03:32:51,090 --> 03:32:52,470
Yeah... it's okay though.

4583
03:32:54,210 --> 03:32:57,370
I'm not like... gonna cry about it.

4584
03:33:04,770 --> 03:33:05,250
But...

4585
03:33:06,510 --> 03:33:10,770
I want to make sure that things aren't so loud so that they don't get caught so easily, you know?

4586
03:33:11,070 --> 03:33:12,710
Yeah, the Med Wars one.

4587
03:33:12,890 --> 03:33:17,870
Even though I was just like... over top of it, it recognized the video which is so crazy.

4588
03:33:18,190 --> 03:33:18,670
Right?

4589
03:33:19,090 --> 03:33:20,510
There's something strange...

4590
03:33:20,510 --> 03:33:22,770
Sleeping in your bed...

4591
03:33:22,770 --> 03:33:26,970
Let me tell you something...

4592
03:33:27,510 --> 03:33:29,370
There's something weird...

4593
03:33:29,370 --> 03:33:31,550
Sleeping in your bed...

4594
03:33:31,550 --> 03:33:33,510
Let me tell you something...

4595
03:33:34,170 --> 03:33:36,470
Bustin' makes me feel good...

4596
03:33:40,190 --> 03:33:46,110
Bustin' Bustin' Bustin' Bustin' Bustin' Bustin' Bustin' Bustin' Bustin' You paused it a bunch?

4597
03:33:48,110 --> 03:33:50,210
Too many times and you still caught it.

4598
03:33:50,230 --> 03:33:50,870
I know, right?

4599
03:33:51,010 --> 03:33:52,930
I was really surprised.

4600
03:33:53,290 --> 03:33:53,890
YouTube's...

4601
03:33:53,890 --> 03:33:56,170
It makes me worried about...

4602
03:33:56,170 --> 03:33:59,410
About livestreams and stuff like that now.

4603
03:33:59,510 --> 03:34:01,770
Like watching the animals and stuff.

4604
03:34:02,010 --> 03:34:02,910
At the aquarium.

4605
03:34:04,650 --> 03:34:10,850
Bum Bum Da Da Da Da Bum Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah An invisible man...

4606
03:34:10,850 --> 03:34:12,670

4607
03:34:13,350 --> 03:34:13,990
Oh!

4608
03:34:14,130 --> 03:34:14,710

03:34:21,810 --> 03:34:23,870
OMG, not the picture...

An invisible bed.

4630
03:35:35,740 --> 03:35:37,540
Freaky ghost man.

4631
03:35:44,260 --> 03:35:51,000
