1
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,680
You guys can hear it, right?

2
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,340
Yeah.

3
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,140
You guys can hear it, right?

4
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,060
Yes.

5
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,580
So people were like, what are you doing?

6
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,660
It's the music!

7
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,340
It's the background music!

8
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,960
You hear it?

9
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,640
It's kind of like

10
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,600
Friday the 13th.

11
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,260
The music's a little quiet.

12
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,040
Oh, it's so loud in my ear.

13
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,650
It's so loud for me.

14
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:54,380
It is not quiet.

15
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,740
We'll put it like here.

16
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,960
It should be better, right?

17
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,360
That's loud, I don't know what they mean.

18
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,460
Ma'am, I joined your membership, but I have a request.

19
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,760
Could you use your OL skills to really sell your membership
to me?

20
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,300
Sales pitch.

21
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,960
When you hear sales pitch, what do you think?

22
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,120
You might be intimidated.

23
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,980
You might think, I don't want to be sailed to.

24
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:52,200
you know I'm tone deaf so pitch is not my forte I don't even
like using the word forte because I'm not musically inclined

25
00:04:52,200 --> 00:05:10,400
but I would say that that my pitch is pitch perfect and if
you want more quality content such as that you should join

26
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,200
my memberships.

27
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,880
The Membou ships.

28
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,360
Sold.

Thank you.

30
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,580
Wait, now I'm low and the game is loud?

31
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,150
Okay, I'm gonna turn it back down then.

32
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:25,960
Oh, oh.

33
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,680
I think I have to do it manually.

34
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:36,480
Wait.

35
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,580
Okay.

36
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,420
Thank you guys for the gift.

37
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:45,900
Thank you.

38
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,300
I'll take your entire stock.

39
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,680
Thank you.

Thank you.

44
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,500
Wait, it lit up for like two seconds.

45
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,000
Uh.

46
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,260
Oh.

47
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,640
They turned into fake buttons.

48
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,560
What happened?

49
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,540
What even happened?

50
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:14,890

55
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:10,460
It might be that their nose is wrong or they're, they're,
they might have multiple eyeballs.

56
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,520
Who knows?

57
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,240
Anything is possible.

58
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,040
No, that is not a solid neighbor.

59
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:15,740
Exactly.

60
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,180
Glory to Ars Tosca.

61
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,880

Doppelgangers is what they're called.

69
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,760
Possibility to find and complete the Chester's quiz.

70
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,960
I have no idea what that is.

71
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,040
I've never played this before.

72
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:31,380
Oh.

73
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,410
But we're gonna check it out.

74
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,720
The following short film is a production of DDD with
educational finds.

75
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,160
Finds.

76
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,080
Hello, if you're watching Watching this film, it's because
you're the new doorman in your building!

77
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,000
Your job is to determine whether the person who wants to
enter the building is a doppelganger.

78
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,860
As everyone knows, doppelgangers have the ability to
transform into another person and impersonate them.

79
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,000
But some are not too good at it, and could generate
imperfections.

80
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,660
You have to pay close attention to the appearance of your
neighbors.

81
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,620
really judgmental.

82
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,280
Got it.

83
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,660
Also, remember to fill out the checklist for each neighbor.

84
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,940
You can't miss any detail because it could mean death for
you and your neighbors.

85
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:31,920
Ah!

86
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,220
This is the structure of your office.

87
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,680
Now we are going to explain how it works.

88
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,900
This is so cute.

89
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,880
Here is the security window.

90
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,400
Don't forget to observe very well each individual who
approaches.

91
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:57,940
okay my big eyes on the right you have the folders with all
the data of each neighbor according to the respective floor

92
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:13,460
to fill out the checklist take each one of the lists in
front of you what receive documents from this hatch okay I

93
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,600
should probably be paying attention right B, B, B.

94
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:24,520
If you determine that the individual isn't a doppelganger,
then allow them into the building with these buttons.

95
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,880
The apostrophe.

96
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:34,120
Otherwise, if you determine that it is in fact a
doppelganger, press the emergency button and call 3-3-1-2.

97
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,500
Okay.

98
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,660
To communicate with the DDD or any apartment in your
building, use the telephone in front of you.

99
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,540
I've never seen a telephone before.

100
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,400
Oh, hot dog.

101
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,580
Yippee!

102
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,320
Yee-haw!

103
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,720
We're in the future!

104
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,380
Your job is really important, so make sure you do it right!

105
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,420
What was the number?

106
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,080
Uh-oh.

107
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,800
Finally, we congratulate the doorman of the month, Henry!

108
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,980
It wasn't that he did an excellent job, but he was the only
doorman in the area who didn't get killed by doppelgangers.

109
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,700
3-3-1-2?

110
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,480
Be like Henry.

111
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,560
But better!

112
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,560
Oh, he looks so...

113
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,020
Like, okay.

114
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:18,620
Every time...

115
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,900
Every time...

116
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,420
Oh!

117
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,400
Welcome and congratulations on your new job.

118
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,600
Oh, that's right here.

119
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,260
It's 3-3-1-2.

120
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,660
As you can see in the introductory film, your job is to
verify the entry of the neighbors of your building.

121
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,700
Each day there will be a list of individuals who will
request entry to the building.

122
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,540
It is possible that there are individuals who request entry
and aren't.

123
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,500
on the list in which case you will mark on the checklist
that they are not on the list and proceed to question the

124
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:57,360
individual also you must verify that the ID and the entry
requests are correct and have the respective DDD logo don't

125
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:07,600
forget to also check the expiration date on the IDs remember

348
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,680
So neither of them are home.

349
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,220
Dozo.

350
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,800
I can't say I'm a huge fan of that beeping sound.

351
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,840
It's kind of...

352
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,500
Oh, it's like that.

353
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,600
Oh, it's so loud.

354
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,260
It's so loud.

355
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,020

393
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,700
Cleaning protocol completed.

394
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,860
Thank you.

395
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,840
You can continue your job.

396
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,480
I wish I didn't.

397
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,120
That was frightening.

398
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,800
I hope they cover therapy.

399
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,240

Oh!

404
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,850
My appearance?

405
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:19,810
Nose?

406
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,670
My nose?

407
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,050
I was born without a nose.

408
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:25,450
Oh my gosh.

409
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,610
It's normal for humans.

410
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,040
Yeah.

411
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,160
He was born without a nose.

412
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,120
It's normal.

413
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,220
You heard him.

414
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,600
You heard Mr. Robertsky Peachman.

415
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,500
Peach fuzz.

416
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,300
Oh, he looks so weird.

417
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,620
Wait, I am a resident of the building.

418
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,940
I come home, I come from my job as a shoemaker.

419
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,300
O-1-0-2.

420
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,180
Yes, shoemaker.

421
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,520
2668.

422
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,920
Also, he's not on the list.

423
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,420
Am I not on today's list?

424
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,700
I think there is an error.

425
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,720
I should be on the list.

426
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,140
Look at the list again.

427
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,820
I didn't.

428
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,140
Yep.

429
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,780
Not there, mister.

430
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,000
I already answered your question.

431
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,380
Red flags.

432
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,040
Let's call 2668.

433
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,680
What if he picks up?

434
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,460
Got your nose.

435
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,160
Take the L, bro.

436
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,200
I know.

437
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,300
Hello, Robert's Key Peach.

438
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,160
Wait, isn't that who that guy is supposed to be?

439
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,660
My brother and I are in the apartment right now.

440
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,360
Are you expecting visitors?

441
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,240
We are not expecting any visitors today.

442
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:08,060
This guy, he looks, without the nose, he looks so much more
suspicious.

443
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,580
Okay, buddy.

444
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,940
I think we're going to have to...

445
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,210
of a good point.

446
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,530
Not everybody has a nose.

447
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,050
Not everybody has a nose.

448
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,170
Oh, uh, three.

449
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,970
I forget that I have to call.

450
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,030
What if I just sit here for long enough?

451
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,130
Did they get mad or?

452
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,930
Bust him, bust him.

453
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,510
Yeah, we're busting this guy.

454
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,410
Cleaning protocol completed.

455
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,050
How many more do I have to do?

456
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,160
How long is the day?

457
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:55,780
Milkman!

458
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,400
Hello.

459
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,480

00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,280
I come from my job as a milkman.

464
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,460
No way.

465
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,420
He's really a milkman.

466
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,680
Uh, what was your 302?

467
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,040
Oh, appearance.

468
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,200
I for some reason I read appearance.

469
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:25,920
Milkman.

470
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,980
Long nose.

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,760
Thin chin.

472
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,120
Tired eyes.

473
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,080
Short hair.

474
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,260
Can you take off your hat for me, please?

475
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,400
Oh, where's a hat?

476
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:41,860
Never mind.

477
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,440
Okay, Francis.

478
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,660

Perfect.

The door.

484
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,460
You could say please.

485
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:28,820
Hold on.

486
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,880
Before I do that, I am going to...

487
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,200
I think it'd be under sound, right?

488
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,600
Oh, but I want you to still hear them and stuff.

489
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,320
I just hate this sound.

490
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,120
Ugh.

491
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,400

00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,300
He's tired, Mint.

498
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,960

00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,210
Help!

531
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:56,350
Oh!

532
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:57,730
Oh!

533
00:37:59,170 --> 00:37:59,250
Oh!

534
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:00,190
Oh!

535
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:01,990
Oh!

536
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:07,970
1958.

537
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,310
Ooh, here it's about to expire.

538
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,790
I'm a resident of the building.

539
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,550
I come from doing the shopping.

540
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,670
There he is.

541
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,490
For real.

542
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,470
He's retired.

543
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:23,930
Oh!

544
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:24,130
Oh!

545
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:24,350
Oh!

546
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:24,410
Oh!

547
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:48,130

548
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:56,850

one, one.

549
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,670
I think we're all good.

550
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,150
And he was on the list, right?

551
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,090
Yep.

552
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:05,970
Oh, let me call his house.

553
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:06,830
Shoot.

554
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,070
Can you open the door for me?

555
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,430
Um, four, two, four, two.

556
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,450
Let me give me a second.

557
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:13,910
Sir.

558
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,610
Oh, oops.

559
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,590
I grouped the four and the twos together in my brain.

560
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,270
Liquid.

561
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:34,630
Nerd walk, lack of nose, Otaku stink, sinister demeanor.

562
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,230
Oh, my father is not at home.

563
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,190
Okay, cool.

564
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:39,370
Don't worry about this.

565
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,830
Just a note for future reference.

566
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:41,690
I hate this.

567
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:43,810
Get in there.

568
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,150
Go home.

569
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,200
How many more people do we have?

570
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,000
Oh!

571
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,750
Ever dream this clown?

572
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,710
Every night all over the world, hundreds of people see this
clown in their dreams.

573
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,510
If this clown appears in your dreams, don't play any game
with him.

574
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:11,590
If you want more information, go to nachogames.itio slash
unlikely.

575
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:12,770
It's an ad!

576
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:18,950
Hey!

577
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,690
Skip ad, skip ad.

578
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,770
Oh my gosh.

579
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:28,970
I can't believe I got an ad.

580
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:29,750
in our game.

581
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:33,730
Hello!

582
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,710
Marguerite Bubbles.

583
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,150
Yes, Marguerite Bubbles.

584
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,590
Your eyes are looking a little lazy.

585
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:47,590
It's okay.

586
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,290
It's probably your charm point.

587
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,090
0203.

588
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,950
She's a seamstress.

589
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,030
Curly hair.

590
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,050
Oh my god, it is!

591
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,310
Deviated left Hi!

592
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,230
It is actually a charm point.

593
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,090
Round nose.

594
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:04,230
Yeah.

595
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,130
Big smile.

596
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,910
Big smile.

597
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,150
Mm-hmm.

598
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,050
I'm not dreaming of the clown.

599
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,150
I'm dreaming of bubbles.

600
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,650
I said jumbles.

601
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,810
Is bubbles your dream, lady?

602
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:28,630
I'm dreaming of Margaret.

603
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:30,810
Bubbles.

604
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:34,790
What?

605
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:35,850
Oh, let me check her ID.

606
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:37,910
First.

607
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:41,810
103.268.

608
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:45,350
014.590.

609
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,230
I think she's good.

610
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,630
Enjoy the rest of your life.

611
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,930
I'm not brave enough to marry this woman.

612
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,950
She would make a man out of you.

613
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:58,930
Hello.

614
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:00,870
You're one of the sisters.

615
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,650
You're Celine's sister.

616
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:05,430
1980.

617
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,490
Wait, are you on the list?

618
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:08,670
Celine's sister.

619
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:10,850
I'm a resident of this building.

620
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,130
My apartment is on the 4th.

621
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,850
Is the 04 on the 1st floor?

622
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:16,890
She's...

623
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:17,510
Okay.

624
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,140
The mole is on the correct side.

625
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,480
She's got the earrings.

626
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:26,880
Okay.

627
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,740
Mole on right cheek.

628
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,380
Small pointed nose.

629
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,160
Yes.

630
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,160
Slim.

631
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:38,680
Long neck.

632
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,240
Okay.

633
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,400
She has a twin.

634
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,540
That's not an appearance.

635
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,760
That doesn't mean anything.

636
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,400
That doesn't mean anything.

637
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,060
Let's try.

638
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:54,820
Six.

639
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,400
Nine.

640
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,000
Nine.

641
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,280
Six.

642
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,360
What was the other sister's name?

643
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,120
Elise or Illinois?

644
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,060
Illinois's sister.

645
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,960
My sister is not at home.

646
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,080
Okay.

647
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:16,780
Oh.

648
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:17,760
Okay.

649
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:18,420
Wine.

650
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,400
785-613.

651
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,400
785-613.

652
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,240
269-514.

653
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:28,940
Sorry.

654
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,120
We're good.

655
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,840
Have a nice life.

656
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,870
What if I, I just shut, I locked the door in front of her.

657
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:41,620
Mm-hmm.

658
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,340
Oh!

659
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,160
Good afternoon, Mr. Albertsky Peach Man.

660
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,900
What is up with the peaches?

661
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:56,680
Why?

662
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,920
What, do they have a lot of money or something?

663
00:43:59,100 --> 00:43:59,640
No.

664
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,880
Their name.

665
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,780
They are peaches.

666
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,920
They sound delicious.

667
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,020
That's why all the monsters want to impersonate and eat
them.

668
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,460
Peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches,
peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches.

669
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,400
I love you.

670
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,440
Um, we might want to ask him about the I thing.

671
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,320
Come from my job as a shoemaker.

672
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,340
Was he on the list?

673
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,140
No.

674
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:30,560
Um.

675
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,900
My appearance?

676
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:33,560
Yeah.

677
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,720
I just want to know...

678
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,700
I don't see anything strange with my appearance.

679
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,500
I can see it well with my one eye.

680
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:45,520
Mm-hmm.

681
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,080
Welcome to membership.

682
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,000
Thank you.

683
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,700
Minto droopy eyes.

684
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,420
No nose.

685
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,820
Tiny cute dead.

686
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,180
Tiny cute dead.

687
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,340
Always wears a mid dress.

688
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,900
Until the day I don't.

689
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,320
That would be shocking.

690
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:03,660
Um...

691
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,960
I already answered your question.

692
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,200
I want to see if he gets a little upset, you know?

693
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,520
Like if he's just like, hey, come over here!

694
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,180
Maybe not.

695
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,300
I think it's time we...

696
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,040
Um, danger.

697
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,460
Thanks for the vibe, Captain!

698
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,620
Thank you!

699
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,100
3-3-0.

700
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,160
One, two...

701
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:45,630
Don't you roll your eye at me, Mint.

702
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,950
Yeah, don't roll your eye at me, mister.

703
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:49,550
Nice.

704
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:53,610
I'm gonna continue my job.

705
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,450
When will this day end?

706
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,290
Do you guys hear the...

707
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:01,770
I wanna know if it's part of the game or if you guys hear
like the buzzing also.

708
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:04,090
I can't tell if it's my headphones or not.

709
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:05,590
Good afternoon.

710
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:07,710
Where is your entry request?

711
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:09,790
Thank you.

712
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:11,210
Oh, you do hear the buzz?

713
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:11,730
Okay.

714
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:13,270
I think it's the game then.

715
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,690
I was worried it was my headphones.

716
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:18,270
You are not on the list.

717
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:23,330
Am I not on today's list?

763
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:02,590
His head is normal.

So is everything in order?

781
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:04,770
Can you open the door for me?

782
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:06,770
Oh, dang.

785
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:14,250
Alright.

786
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:15,470
Gosh.

787
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:18,230
These guys just need to remain on site, too.

788
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:21,370
Let them in.

789
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,770
We're playing the game proper now.

790
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:27,950
We'll have some fun, like, shenanigans stuff later.

791
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:30,730
Agree.

792
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:31,230
Oh, oops.

00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:37,870

00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:55,310
Six dopples.

803
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:56,930
Neighbors killed zero.

804
00:51:58,330 --> 00:51:58,670

805
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:00,730

812
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,200
Skip, skip.

813
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,120
Goodbye, goodbye.

819
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,320
Yes, you forgot to show your ID.

820
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,220
Can't believe that Cyclops was a doppel.

821
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,900
They're really tricky, aren't they?

822
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,880
They really try to get you.

823
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,520

824
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,180

828
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,040
Oh, you both are actually shoemakers.

829
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,120

00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,280

00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,300
Your brother has the no chin.

835
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:25,420
What?

836
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,320
They don't write that in the appearance, though?

837
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,200
No chin?

838
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:37,080

00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:29,760
I think we're good.

903
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:30,300
Okay.

904
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:39,960
We just have to burn... It's like when you see a spider in
your room, you just have to...

905
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,100
42?

906
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,400
You just have to burn the whole place down?

907
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:44,880
42.

908
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,200
43.

909
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:48,680
Oh!

910
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,980
42, 42, 42, 42, 42.

911
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,940
Is this 42 ones?

912
00:56:55,740 --> 00:57:01,180
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

913
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,800
12 times 3.

914
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,420
Oh, 2, 4, 6.

915
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,400
36.

916
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,540
37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42!

917
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,500
Who would have thought?

918
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:33,290
I think he means well.

919
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:41,550
He's quite obviously just trying to teach the youngins how
to count.

920
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:47,470
I've never seen Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, so...

921
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:53,770
He's a man who knows what he wants.

922
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:54,710
42!

923
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:56,590
Not 41.

924
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:58,330
Not 43.

925
00:57:59,010 --> 00:57:59,530
42.

926
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:01,430
Anyway.

927
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:04,490
Oh.

928
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:09,230
I just realized that the date actually didn't change, which
is kind of disappointing.

929
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,060
Thank you.

930
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,200
What are the trophies that I keep getting?

931
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,040
Are they under here?

932
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,260
Maybe on the menu.

933
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:40,620
When I was a part of hockey team, my number was 42.

934
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:41,620
No way.

935
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,440
Mm, hi or whatever.

936
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:46,480
Mm, hi.

937
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,140
Anastasia.

938
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,080
Anastasia.

939
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:53,700
1985.

940
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,240
I live here, whatever.

941
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,000
I come from school.

942
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:00,500
Okay.

943
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:01,340
Oh my gosh, she's got it.

944
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:10,520

946
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:32,480
round face She checks out.

947
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:38,200
1, 3, 2, 6, 9, 8.

948
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,760
5, 3, 4, 4, 6, 2.

949
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:47,280
Yeah, we're going to call our chef.

950
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,640
Wait, what if she's not there, though?

951
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:51,520
Okay.

952
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:54,320
1, 3, 4, 6.

953
00:59:55,700 --> 01:00:00,020
1, 3, 4, 6.

954
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,340
Look, I'm the member.

955
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,440
Mooship, thank you!

956
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:08,290
Hello.

957
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:09,050
What?

958
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,120
My mother's...

959
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:15,480
Whatever.

960
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:31,100
Sneaky.

961
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,580
What if I say, like, ID?

962
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:34,780
My ID?

963
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,000
Are you gonna get mad at me?

964
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:36,880
A little doppelganger?

965
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,040
I don't see anything wrong with my ID.

966
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:42,140
Whatever.

967
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:44,380
Oh my gosh, she's even got her mannerisms down.

968
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,460
What's wrong with my appearance?

969
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,720
Everything is in order with my appearance.

970
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,260
Whatever.

971
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:56,480
Whatever.

972
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,700
My entry request?

973
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,320
I think everything's fine with my entry request.

974
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,640
Is that a zipper on her back?

975
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:10,500
This right here?

976
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:13,520
Let's check her picture.

977
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,520
No, she has it in the original too.

978
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,840
I think it might be maybe like the...

979
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,480
Maybe part of the backpack.

980
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:25,820
Like the handlebar of the backpack, you know?

981
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,220
Okay, anyway.

982
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:35,620
Three, three, one, two.

983
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,800
What's stopping these doppelgangers from just like climbing
the window?

984
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:40,840
You know?

985
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:42,440
Whatever.

986
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:43,160
Whatever.

987
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,240
That was tricky.

988
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,040
If we hadn't called...

989
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:50,940
Imagine, like, the first one!

990
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,840
The first one was completely fine.

991
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,400
If we hadn't called...

992
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:58,820
Well, I guess...

993
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:00,800
Well, he was on the list, actually, now I think about it.

994
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:01,480
Oh, my gosh!

995
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:02,160
Emma Stone!

996
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,140
Mia Stone!

997
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:07,300
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum.

998
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,740
Then, I came back from my job as a teacher.

999
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,900
Her hips don't lie.

1000
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:15,980
Wow.

1001
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,720
You are not on the list.

1002
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,980
Am I not on today's list?

1003
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,200
Must be a mistake.

1004
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,720
I should be on the list.

1005
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:30,600
No, you're not.

1006
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:31,880
You're not.

1007
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,860
Wait, who do you live with?

1008
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:37,840
301?

1009
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,300
Oh yes, of course.

1010
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:42,160
How could I ever get W.

1011
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:42,940
Afton?

1012
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,980
She looks the exact same.

1013
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:49,940
From what I can tell.

1014
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,860
1-4-2-5.

1015
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:04,280
Hmm.

1016
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:13,260
The real giveaway for the last doppel was actually her entry
request was missing the DDD logo.

1017
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:13,860
Oh!

1018
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:14,280
Wait.

1019
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,080
Who just picked?

1020
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:16,200
Oh.

1021
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:18,840
Oh, wait.

1022
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:19,920
Was that Afton?

1023
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,640
Sorry, I missed the name.

1024
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,140
I was reading the comment.

1025
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,100
Did he say Mia?

1026
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,200
That was Afton?

1027
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,100
Oh, okay.

1028
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,320
Then, I guess she...

1029
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,720
Okay, let's check the number.

1030
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:38,520
789.

1031
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:43,460
I need to be better about the DDD logos then, because I
didn't even notice at all.

1032
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,680
Good eye.

1033
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:47,600
789564.

1034
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:49,560
525-115.

1035
01:03:51,660 --> 01:04:02,320
um lady make sure you properly get your stuff in order next
time for going out yes you need to properly get your stuff

paperwork but i'm gonna let you in

1037
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,100
Hello, good day.

1038
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:21,740
Where's your ID?

1039
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,340
Sorry, here's my ID.

1040
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,100
Yeah, I was about to literally call the police on you.

1041
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,780
I was about to get your butt annihilated.

1042
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,800
They were going to come in.

1043
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:36,140
They were going to literally destroy you.

1044
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:38,160
Reptilian.

1045
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:41,760
Mm-hmm.

01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:24,210

1050
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:26,270
Like, my goodness.

1051
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:28,670
Hmm.

1052
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:31,390
Alph speaking.

1053
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:34,210
My wife is not at home.

1054
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:34,830
Okay.

1055
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:37,630
Yes, maybe.

1056
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:48,890
It could be some sinister beast waiting for you to trust it
so then it can pounce and suck.

1057
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:51,810
all your blood from your body.

1058
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:59,330
I forgot to show my entry request.

1059
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:01,610
How long have you been living here, Robertski?

1060
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:04,570
You forget to show your entry request every time.

1061
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:05,730
I'm sick of this.

1062
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:06,790
I'm just gonna...

1063
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,900
But also, he's not on the list.

1064
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,760
But yeah, it is missing the logo.

1065
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:19,080
It's missing the logo.

1066
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:42,060

1068
01:06:53,740 --> 01:07:01,320

2668

1069
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:13,730
but isn't there a thing that some people like to date people
they look like or something or that's I don't know their

1070
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:26,790

01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:36,070
My entry request?

1073
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:40,110
I think everything's fine with my entry request.

1074
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:43,030
That's something a doppelganger would say.

1075
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:50,090
I'm not on today's list because I had to leave due to an
emergency at work.

1076
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:55,550
Likely story.

1077
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:59,670
3, 3, 1, 2.

1078
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:02,690
I think this game is relaxing so much it's making me so
tired.

1079
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:06,990
Oh, sorry if you just heard me kick my mic.

1080
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:10,930
Or rather I need it while I was adjusting.

1081
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:13,330
Bust him.

1082
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:14,790
Bust him!

1083
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:17,670
I'm so sleepy today.

1084
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,920
Next, please.

1085
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:25,900
Wait,

1086
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:33,880
didn't we see you earlier or...

1087
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:38,960
Didn't we see you earlier?

1088
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,420
One, four, two, five.

1089
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:49,650
We did?

1090
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:53,110
We just let her in?

1091
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:55,010
Pick up.

1092
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:55,850
Oh.

1093
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:57,970
W.O.O.

1094
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:58,450
Often speaking.

1095
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:01,770
My fiance and I are in the apartment right now.

1096
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:04,010
We are in the apartment.

1097
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:06,030
We're not expecting any visitors today.

1098
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:12,430
Uh.

1099
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:20,550
Everything's the same.

1100
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:23,390
As before.

1101
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,380
Well, clearly that means there's two wives.

1102
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,340
79.564.

1103
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,020
425.

1104
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,280
5115.

1105
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,840
Clearly that means if I let both of them in, he'll be so
happy.

1106
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:53,240
What's the difference in appearance?

1107
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,040
Did I get the appearance on the other lady wrong?

1108
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:58,840
Or is this the one that's the fake?

1109
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:02,520
Uh-oh.

1110
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:04,700
Uh-oh.

1111
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,840
This all looks good, though.

1112
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,720
This all looks good.

1113
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:18,600
Oh.

1114
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:29,490
Check the freckles.

1115
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,230
They look the same.

1116
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:41,410
Uh-oh.

1117
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:43,990
Is the job right?

1118
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:46,190
Yeah.

1119
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:54,220
I checked the numbers.

1120
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:58,080
I checked the numbers.

1121
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:01,380
Oh.

1122
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:12,820
Let's check up again, 789, 564, 525, 115, yeah.

1123
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:14,860
But I checked it last time, too.

1124
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:22,250
I think we let the wrong Mia in.

1125
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:27,910
Wait, but he would have been eaten, right?

1126
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:31,350
Her birthday.

1127
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:32,950
This isn't the birthday.

1128
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:36,030
This is the expiration.

1129
01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:44,370
date because um sorry the chat's kind of blocking it but
it's currently february 1955 i just check the the expiration

1130
01:11:44,370 --> 01:12:03,080
make sure it's not call again one four two five four two
five oh my gosh am i gonna have to kill an innocent person

1131
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:12,040
maybe yeah you're still alive They're in the apartment.

1132
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:12,560
How?

1133
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:13,760
I just want to know.

1134
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:16,480
How?

1135
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:26,610
How would I know?

1136
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:29,770
That this is the imposter.

1137
01:12:32,170 --> 01:12:33,450
They don't kill immediately?

1138
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:37,030
Look at the logos.

1139
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:37,570
I am.

1140
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:38,250
I am.

1141
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:41,830
I actually don't remember what the logo is supposed to look
like.

1142
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:46,690
They don't give a reference, so I just have to believe that
this is the correct thing.

1143
01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:54,250
I think this is the real one.

1144
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:57,650
I think so, too.

1145
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,400
Try asking questions again.

1146
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:05,700
My ID?

1147
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:09,120
I don't see anything wrong with my ID.

1148
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:15,710
What's wrong with my appearance?

1149
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:18,290
Oh, you...

1150
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:20,570
You...

1151
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:21,950
You...

1152
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:23,950
The eyeshadow's not flattering on you.

1153
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:29,830
Let them both in problem solved.

1154
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:32,630
Either way, even if I...

1155
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:36,810
If I call the DDD on this lady, she's gonna... She's gonna
die, so...

1156
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:36,970
Yeah.

1157
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:38,190
Okay.

1158
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:40,270
You're welcome, Mr. Afton.

1159
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:42,390
Now you have two wives!

1160
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:43,950
Lucky you!

1161
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:50,670
Good afternoon, why are you not on the list?

1162
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:57,010
Now they both die.

1163
01:13:57,270 --> 01:14:01,630
If I had called the DDD on the lady standing here, she would
have died anyway.

1164
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:06,990
So now, you know, they're all just, they'll all just, you
know.

1165
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:09,570
That's just how the circle of life works.

1166
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:10,710
Gloria Schmidt.

1167
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:12,030
She's not on the list.

1168
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:13,510
But she is a banker.

1169
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:14,950
1974.

1170
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:21,460
Round face.

1171
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:26,000
Mole on right cheek.

1172
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:28,840
The nose!

1173
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:29,960
The nose!

1174
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:30,420
The nose!

1175
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:31,020
The nose!

1176
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:31,440
The nose!

1177
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:34,220
The nose is wrong.

1178
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:36,280
What's wrong with my appearance?

1179
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,320
Look carefully at my photos of my papers and compare them
well with me.

1180
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:45,080
Oh, ma'am, I assure you I am.

1181
01:14:46,080 --> 01:15:05,830
sure you Gloria Schmidt of the bank I am doing that but I am
gonna call just in case I think there was a grammar error

1182
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:15,950
when you asked about her appearance I'm inclined to believe
maybe that this the game dev is maybe not is maybe English

1183
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:22,730
second language or something because there's been a lot of
grammar errors so i'm not kind of like putting that as a uh

1184
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:25,470
as a uh thing

1185
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:34,510

Oh!

1190
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:02,560
Heterochromia.

1191
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:03,680
Good afternoon.

1192
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:04,760
One second.

1193
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,940
I have to make sure someone else is dead.

1194
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:11,880
He's probably gonna be like, Look!

1195
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,860
Dorman, I have two wives!

1196
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:15,980
I'm the luckiest man on this world!

1197
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:18,640
Wait, what is he gonna say?

1198
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,780
My fiance and I are in the apartment right now.

1199
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,600
We are not expecting any visitors today.

1200
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,080
Interesting.

1201
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,300
Wait, does she usually have...

1202
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:33,800
It's Natcha.

1203
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:37,640
0204.

1204
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,020
Right eye blue.

1205
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,320
Left eye green.

1206
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:45,800
Wait, actually!

1207
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:50,780
She does actually have heterochromia.

1208
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:52,720
Curly hair.

1209
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:59,220
Yeah, freckles, round face.

1210
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:04,420
She looks good to me, but she's not on the list.

1211
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:06,940
Mm-hmm.

1212
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:08,960
More right or hers?

1213
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,400
It has to be her right, right?

1214
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:19,900
No, I'm pretty sure it's her right, because everything else
has said, like, mole on right cheek, and it's been correct.

1215
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:25,180
it's her right

1216
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:39,820
she's a chef I'm a resident of the building I come from my
job as a chef you can also kind of see it in the picture too

1217
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:46,880
see like this looks darker and this one looks lighter her
nose is gone

1218
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:59,200
789 655413 I'm so sorry that I'm yawning so much I don't

1222
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:33,710
I think you got the first Mia, right?

1223
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:34,190
Really?

1224
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:35,150
You think so?

1225
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:42,590
You think maybe just because she was even though she was
perfect, she...

1226
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:43,330
I don't know.

1227
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:45,070
Oh, whoops, sorry.

1228
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:50,490
What is underneath there?

1229
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:53,190
What was that?

1230
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:56,650
Um.

1231
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:02,860
So, Some doppelgangers can be perfect.

1232
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:03,460
They can?

1233
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:07,140
Oh, well, I think he's really appreciative.

1234
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:08,320
Wait.

1235
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:10,260
Was it second floor?

1236
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,000
There we go.

1237
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:12,980
She looks right to me.

1238
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,420
Even though you're not on today's list.

1239
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:19,080
Can you tell me again why?

1240
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:23,760
I think there's an error.

1241
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:25,040
I should be on the list.

1242
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,980
Oh, well.

1243
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:30,540
Oh, well.

1244
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,700
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, let her in.

1245
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:37,640
I almost just murdered an innocent lady.

1246
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:39,440
Oh, no.

1247
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:42,520
Oh.

1248
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,360

01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:55,700

1253
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:56,980

01:31:46,010 --> 01:31:47,230
This, uh, I'm...

1430
01:31:47,230 --> 01:31:49,690
It sure would be something to 100% this game.

1431
01:31:49,790 --> 01:31:50,710
I know, right?

1432
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:53,930
I think, uh, this one, steal memory.

1433
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:56,370
That is not my...

1434
01:31:56,370 --> 01:31:57,830
That is not...

1435
01:31:59,370 --> 01:32:14,690
is rough for me like capture a hop hopl capture a hundred
doppelgangers is doable you just have to play the game a lot

1436
01:32:14,690 --> 01:32:31,820
I mean we're already at 12 so and 40 play-throughs I think
you can get both of these you know let's try again oh let's

1437
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:38,880
try and at least get like the peach one and whatever the
quiz is i do i'm curious about that the ones that are like

1438
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:48,520
the special doppelgangers i'm i'm most curious about and
then i guess they'll be adding more modes in the future

1439
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:56,140
that'll be fun unless you unlock them when you get more
achievements that'll be fun though ian vivian welcome to

1440
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:58,360
bamboo ship thank you bro thank you

1441
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:03,380
Yeah.

1442
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,160
Oh, we can skip this.

1443
01:33:10,730 --> 01:33:11,250
Hello.

1444
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:13,670
Skip.

1445
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:14,890
See ya.

1446
01:33:17,090 --> 01:33:17,610
Sayya.

1447
01:33:17,930 --> 01:33:18,070
Sayya.

1448
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:18,450
Sayya.

1449
01:33:20,390 --> 01:33:23,270
This time, let's get an F.

1450
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:24,310
Hello.

1451
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:27,730
We have to get an F.

1452
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:31,770
We have to get an F since it was the lowest and there were
so many in between we probably have to get every single one

1453
01:33:31,770 --> 01:33:32,730
incorrect.

1454
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,130
Whoa, whee!

1455
01:33:38,610 --> 01:33:39,490
Full day!

1456
01:33:40,530 --> 01:33:40,970
Wow!

1457
01:33:42,030 --> 01:33:42,790
Which one is you?

1458
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:43,910
Selene.

1459
01:33:45,450 --> 01:33:54,490
Every night in my dreams I see you, I feel you.

1460
01:33:54,650 --> 01:33:57,310
Selene has it on the right side.

1461
01:33:58,630 --> 01:34:01,470
Um, pointed nose, yeah.

1462
01:34:04,030 --> 01:34:06,510
Maybe, I don't know, I guess.

1463
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:11,210
Long neck, short, twin.

1464
01:34:12,830 --> 01:34:15,970
So if this is correct, that means we call the cops on her.

1465
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:19,170
Have, both have logos.

1466
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:29,270
So seven, eight, five, six, one, three, two, six, nine,
five, one, four.

1467
01:34:29,970 --> 01:34:32,750
I think we need to call the cops on Celine Dion.

1468
01:34:35,810 --> 01:34:37,210
Oh, call the house.

1469
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:40,570
Let's call the house.

1470
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:42,390
6996.

1471
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:47,150
6996.

1472
01:34:49,110 --> 01:34:49,750
9996.

1473
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:53,370
Genocide run.

1474
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:55,170
Yep.

1475
01:34:55,350 --> 01:34:58,130
So this time we are going for all inaccurate.

1476
01:34:58,950 --> 01:34:59,770
No one's home.

1477
01:35:00,930 --> 01:35:02,510
Get her out of here.

1478
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:03,890
Good.

1479
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,060
You will not survive here.

1480
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:19,540
You will not ever see your family again.

1481
01:35:24,110 --> 01:35:25,820
Thank you.

1482
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:35,030
Let's hope we get some obvious doppelgangers in here.

1483
01:35:35,910 --> 01:35:38,230
I like Roman.

1484
01:35:40,210 --> 01:35:41,910
We haven't seen you in a while.

1485
01:35:43,290 --> 01:35:46,290
I hope you're a doppelganger, so I don't have to kill you.

1486
01:35:48,130 --> 01:35:48,850
One, one.

1487
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:55,830
Oh, yeah, you got that lucky, lucky, you're a lucky man, you
know that?

1488
01:35:56,830 --> 01:36:02,270
You're a lucky, lucky man, Mr. Roman Stiltsky.

1489
01:36:03,670 --> 01:36:05,150
Big nose, yeah.

1490
01:36:05,950 --> 01:36:07,730
Scar on right chin, yeah.

1491
01:36:08,330 --> 01:36:09,830
Long face, yeah.

1492
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:12,450
One eyebrow, yeah.

1493
01:36:13,290 --> 01:36:15,050
Where's a hat?

1494
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:17,290
You can't be correct.

1495
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:19,780
He has an expiration date.

1496
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:25,780
483-924-059-684.

1497
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:27,870
No!

1498
01:36:28,770 --> 01:36:29,300
No!

1499
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:30,830
No!

1500
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:31,790
No!

1501
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:33,650
Oh wait, is he on a list?

1502
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:37,290
Let's call his house.

1503
01:36:39,610 --> 01:36:40,670
1152.

1504
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,340
Let's check.

1505
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:48,780
Let's check.

1506
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:50,480
It's a villager.

1507
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:50,840
Ha.

1508
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:52,200
Ha.

1509
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:55,840
Lois Stiltsky speaking.

1510
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:04,760
No.

1511
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:10,080
I'm not on today's list because I had to leave due to an
emergency at work.

1512
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:11,000
You're an accountant.

1513
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:12,780
What kind of an emergency would there be?

1514
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:16,080
Hmm.

1515
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:24,860
07.

1516
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,040
The numbers were wrong?

1517
01:37:29,980 --> 01:37:30,620
No, they weren't.

1518
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:32,200
They were?

1519
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:35,680
4, 8, 3, 9, 2, 4.

1520
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,140
0, 5, 9.

1521
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:41,160
6, 8, 4.

1522
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:41,960
They're all right.

1523
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:43,760
Oh!

1524
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:45,960
You mean the numbers?

1525
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:52,200
You mean there was an accounting error?

1526
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:55,880
Not an error from me!

1527
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,940
Oh man.

1528
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:00,860
07.

1529
01:38:07,690 --> 01:38:09,590
Have your doppelganger come back.

1530
01:38:10,770 --> 01:38:11,290
Emergency accounting.

1531
01:38:11,610 --> 01:38:17,770
I have contacted the day, day, day.

1532
01:38:18,430 --> 01:38:19,010
Say a lighter.

1533
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:27,570
There was an emergency he didn't account for.

1534
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:36,130
Good afternoon.

1535
01:38:36,570 --> 01:38:50,110
Gloria, Gloria, round face, mole on the right cheek, short
hair, round nose, you're looking perfect today, Gloria, I

1536
01:38:50,110 --> 01:38:51,790
might have to call the cops on you.

1537
01:38:53,850 --> 01:38:54,830
Job is a banker.

1538
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:58,610
I work at the bank.

1539
01:39:02,410 --> 01:39:05,250
Can their names be written wrong and stuff?

1540
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:07,690
I wonder how small the details go into, you know.

1541
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:12,630
He didn't really excel today.

1542
01:39:18,650 --> 01:39:19,210
Oh.

1543
01:39:20,470 --> 01:39:27,430
He didn't calculate how poor this would be for him.

1544
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:32,780
Oh.

1545
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:35,700
Boo.

1546
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:37,020
Ah, thank you guys.

1547
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:37,440
Thank you.

1548
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:38,400
I knew you'd love it.

1549
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:39,160
Boo, boo.

1550
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:40,100
Yes, yes!

1551
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:41,380
Boo!

1552
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:43,060
Yes, yes!

1553
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:45,600
Thank you, I knew you guys would love it.

1554
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:50,080
69A522

1555
01:39:53,260 --> 01:40:00,500
341 150 I have to make an O emo to go with the B.

1556
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:03,320
I do, I do, I do.

1557
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:05,540
5123

1558
01:40:11,270 --> 01:40:11,970
Let's see.

1559
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:19,920
Hello, Arnold Schmidt speaking.

1560
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:23,040
My wife is not at home.

1561
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:25,800
Is she back?

1562
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:29,160
Oh, she's back all right.

1563
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:33,600
Oh, she's back all right.

1564
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:46,150
She's back to jail.

1565
01:40:58,870 --> 01:40:59,710
Oh.

1566
01:41:01,610 --> 01:41:03,730
She's back to...

1567
01:41:06,670 --> 01:41:07,570
Um...

1568
01:41:07,570 --> 01:41:10,050
Back to being a baby.

1569
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:13,570
In...

1570
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:14,590
In the tummy.

1571
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:17,490
It's like she was never born.

1572
01:41:18,330 --> 01:41:18,750
Yet.

1573
01:41:19,710 --> 01:41:21,070
Or ever again.

1574
01:41:24,190 --> 01:41:25,090
Hello.

1575
01:41:25,790 --> 01:41:27,250
Can I have your ID please?

1576
01:41:27,950 --> 01:41:28,910
Thank you.

1577
01:41:29,810 --> 01:41:31,310
Mr. Robertski.

1578
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:32,670
Are you on the list?

1579
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:35,450
You are.

1580
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:37,550
Uh-oh.

1581
01:41:37,850 --> 01:41:38,010
Wait.

1582
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:39,790
Uh-oh.

1583
01:41:39,830 --> 01:41:41,350
The game is glitching again.

1584
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:43,970
It will let me click on his file.

1585
01:41:48,750 --> 01:41:50,670
Shoemaker, we know that.

1586
01:41:52,270 --> 01:41:54,550
Like, I don't know what his phone number is.

1587
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:03,250
Hold on.

1588
01:42:03,810 --> 01:42:03,830
Oh.

1589
01:42:06,190 --> 01:42:09,250
I think it's 2-6-6-8.

1590
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:10,470
Oh, whoops.

1591
01:42:10,830 --> 01:42:11,690
I'm going to trust you.

1592
01:42:12,150 --> 01:42:15,890
2-6-6-8.

1593
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:17,450
Oh.

1594
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:26,480
You were right.

1595
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:27,400
Wait, Albertsky.

1596
01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:29,260
My brother's not at home.

1597
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:35,960
Yeah, because he's Albertsky and he's Albertsky.

1598
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:37,440
Peachman, Peachman.

1599
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:38,940
Yes.

1600
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:39,720
Thank you.

1601
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:40,200
Okay.

1602
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:42,440
So we knew he was out.

1603
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:43,640
DDD.

1604
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,280
We got the expiration date.

1605
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:46,200
It's good.

1606
01:42:47,380 --> 01:42:50,120
His appearance looks fine to me.

1607
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:52,780
I think I remember what he looks like.

1608
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:54,040
We know he's a shoemaker.

1609
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,060
Get out of here, Peach Man.

1610
01:42:58,820 --> 01:43:01,280
Can I undo this once I... Oh, I can.

1611
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:02,520
Okay, that's kind of nice.

1612
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:05,440
Just kidding.

1613
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:10,180
This guy is just like, No, please don't kill me.

1614
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:10,540
No!

1615
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:11,360
No, God!

1616
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:12,760
Oh, God, please!

1617
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,880
I'm just kidding, Robert Sicky.

1618
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:17,560
I'm not kidding.

1619
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:19,960
Death to you!

1620
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,040
Death to you!

1621
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:22,740
Death to you, Peach Man!

1622
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:23,540
And he's behind there.

1623
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:24,680
He's like, no, please!

1624
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:27,180
Oh, God, Sparrie's, please!

1625
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:28,780
Oh, Sparrie!

1626
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:30,500
I'm just kidding.

1627
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:31,780
I'm just kidding.

1628
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:33,600
Oh, my gosh.

1629
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:36,000
It's just a prank, bro.

1630
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:37,540
It's just a prank.

1631
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:38,460
Oh, no, never mind.

1632
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:46,220
Off with his head.

1633
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:51,720
Do you get anything for making more ghosts?

1634
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:53,180
Like commission?

1635
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:54,960
Fortunately, no.

1636
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:59,880
Actually, the afterlife is kind of crowded.

1637
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:02,600
I don't think they want more ghosts.

1638
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:08,880
Alrighty.

1639
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:11,020
Next person, please.

1640
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:12,800
Hello.

1641
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:16,900
I think we killed your sister.

1642
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:17,540
earlier.

1643
01:44:22,140 --> 01:44:23,720
oh my gosh.

1644
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:26,120
Wait, we can't click the first floor anymore at all?

1645
01:44:26,940 --> 01:44:28,320
Oh, the game is so bugged.

1646
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:33,640
Um, nice.

1647
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:35,800
Uh.

1648
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:42,420
Does anyone know her, her phone number?

1649
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:45,000
She might actually be a doppelganger.

1650
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:45,620
I don't know.

1651
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:46,300
I can't tell.

1652
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:51,680
I don't remember which side the mall is supposed to be on.

1653
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:52,920
No job.

1654
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:55,420
She's a model.

1655
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:56,060
I remember that.

1656
01:44:56,140 --> 01:44:57,340
Vivi Kourt, thanks for the gifted.

1657
01:44:58,800 --> 01:44:59,720
It's 3-3-1-2.

1658
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:00,320
Thank you.

1659
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:05,300
Thank you guys for helping.

1660
01:45:10,290 --> 01:45:11,430
She's on the list.

1661
01:45:15,210 --> 01:45:16,570
You guys tricked me.

1662
01:45:21,450 --> 01:45:22,050
Hi!

1663
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:31,390
Oh, her picture would be on the list, you're so right!

1664
01:45:32,190 --> 01:45:34,210
Oh wait, it looks just like her.

1665
01:45:35,950 --> 01:45:37,410
Yeah, Illinois.

1666
01:45:42,010 --> 01:45:42,610
6996!

1667
01:45:42,730 --> 01:45:43,850
How could I forget?

1668
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:51,070
Thanks, 6J and Kyoma.

1669
01:45:54,610 --> 01:45:55,650
Thank you.

1670
01:45:57,530 --> 01:45:58,510
They're not there?

1671
01:45:58,830 --> 01:45:58,830
Wait.

1672
01:45:59,490 --> 01:45:59,730
Oh wait.

1673
01:45:59,950 --> 01:46:00,110
No.

1674
01:46:00,350 --> 01:46:04,570
Because I killed the sister before, it would make sense that
nobody's home.

1675
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:05,670
Right?

1676
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:08,850
And her little Ahoye is going in the right direction.

1677
01:46:09,770 --> 01:46:12,330
Did he just make these characters and flip them?

1678
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:18,580
I put 69, 69.

1679
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:19,360
Wait.

1680
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:22,620
9?

1681
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:25,360
6.

1682
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:26,780
9.

1683
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:30,580
Oh my god.

1684
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,940
Oh, I need to sleep properly tonight for real.

1685
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:35,480
I'm going to have trouble tomorrow.

1686
01:46:35,580 --> 01:46:37,440
Okay, it's the same reaction, though.

1687
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:42,560
I think I'm just going to have to kill her.

1688
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:44,080
Oh, God.

1689
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,740
Let the sisters be together.

1690
01:46:51,980 --> 01:46:52,480
Exactly.

1691
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:00,720
Thank you.

1692
01:47:01,460 --> 01:47:02,840
Oh, he's still talking.

1693
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:04,680
I need some more tea.

1694
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:05,400
Okay.

1695
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:09,160
Bye-bye.

1696
01:47:10,420 --> 01:47:11,220
See you later.

1697
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:14,660
Next person, please.

1698
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:20,590
Good afternoon.

1699
01:47:21,050 --> 01:47:22,250
Where is your entry request?

1700
01:47:23,190 --> 01:47:24,730
I'm already sussy of you.

1701
01:47:24,930 --> 01:47:25,830
Mia Stone.

1702
01:47:26,530 --> 01:47:27,610
I think she is on the list.

1703
01:47:27,970 --> 01:47:28,950
Yeah, 301.

1704
01:47:33,810 --> 01:47:34,990
Looks the same.

1705
01:47:35,230 --> 01:47:36,330
Let's count the freckles.

1706
01:47:36,930 --> 01:47:37,970
One, two, one, three, now,

1707
01:47:42,090 --> 01:47:42,810
three, now, four, five, six.

1708
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:53,150
eyebrows, oval face, she's a teacher, indeed she is, Emma
Stone.

1709
01:47:59,570 --> 01:48:04,050
Let's call 1 4 2 5.

1710
01:48:05,210 --> 01:48:08,510
1 4 2 5.

1711
01:48:08,610 --> 01:48:15,650
You know what annoys me even more about those who got me
with the 3 3 1 2 being the twins' For the fact that I so

1712
01:48:15,650 --> 01:48:22,110
sincerely thanked you guys for helping me.

1713
01:48:22,210 --> 01:48:23,810
I was just like, oh my gosh, thank you guys.

1714
01:48:24,070 --> 01:48:26,690
Because the game is glitching for me, I can't check myself.

1715
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:28,950
You guys are so awesome for helping me out.

1716
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:39,390
I so sincerely thanked you being like, my, you know, wisps
are so great.

1717
01:48:39,630 --> 01:48:41,150
They're so helpful and kind.

1718
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:43,410
You know, glyphs, I don't want to see that.

1719
01:48:44,150 --> 01:48:45,270
I want to see that from you.

1720
01:48:49,010 --> 01:48:49,790
One guide hard.

1721
01:48:49,970 --> 01:48:51,150
It was two people!

1722
01:48:52,450 --> 01:48:53,750
It was two of them.

1723
01:48:54,030 --> 01:48:55,270
I got two guide.

1724
01:48:57,190 --> 01:48:57,870
Let's see.

1725
01:48:57,930 --> 01:48:59,090
Appearance seems fine.

1726
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:05,510
789564.

1727
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:06,490
789.564.

1728
01:49:06,830 --> 01:49:08,570
525.115.

1729
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:10,070
525115.

1730
01:49:11,850 --> 01:49:12,490
Mia Stone.

1731
01:49:12,690 --> 01:49:15,870
I hope you said some Thanks to your husband tonight.

1732
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:16,770
I mean last night.

1733
01:49:16,910 --> 01:49:20,150
I mean this morning What is wrong with me?

1734
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:27,280
Anyway, okay, you know what?

1735
01:49:27,540 --> 01:49:29,340
Let's just send her away.

1736
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:37,960
Let's just get her out of here.

1737
01:49:40,660 --> 01:49:43,020
Low on brain juice.

1738
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:51,380
Oh my gosh.

1739
01:49:55,180 --> 01:50:01,200
I was just I think because it's tonight like for me you know
it's night so I was just like yeah tonight you better have

them in a bow can you throw them over Why would you hand

1742
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:24,300
this to me, Francis?

1743
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:27,480
What happened to your ears?

1744
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:30,660
My ears?

1745
01:50:32,780 --> 01:50:35,360
I spread them out to hear better.

1746
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:38,140
Make sense to me.

1747
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:40,860
Have a nice day, Francis.

1748
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:45,760
Can you throw them over your shoulder?

1749
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:47,800
Like a something, something.

1750
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:50,920
Hello.

1751
01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:56,580
Uh-oh.

1752
01:50:59,860 --> 01:51:00,700
Uh-oh.

1753
01:51:09,380 --> 01:51:10,420
Oh, we can tie it.

1754
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:11,560
We can click it again.

1755
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:12,100
Nice.

1756
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:16,760
Um, Selene is right or left side.

1757
01:51:20,810 --> 01:51:21,770
She escaped.

1758
01:51:23,450 --> 01:51:25,150
Oh, no, she's a perfect...

1759
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:36,180
The third lost child.

1760
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:38,920
The mole on entry is wrong?

1761
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:39,600
What do you mean?

1762
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:46,120
No, it's correct.

1763
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:49,920
because she's Celine.

1764
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:56,940
Her name is spelled wrong.

1765
01:51:58,640 --> 01:51:59,740
No, it's not.

1766
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:02,640
It's correct.

1767
01:52:04,940 --> 01:52:07,460
How am I supposed to know which one was the right?

1768
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:07,800
Okay.

1769
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:11,240
Okay, I'm going to make an educated guess here.

1770
01:52:12,340 --> 01:52:12,560
What?

1771
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:13,640
It's missing an S.

1772
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:17,660
Oh, her last name!

1773
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:26,000
Subvert, subvert, oh!

1774
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:30,520
My ID?

1775
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:35,800
I don't see anything wrong with my ID.

1776
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:39,440
Well, okay, this was gonna be my educated guess anyway.

1777
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:43,040
This was going to be my educated guess that she was the
doppelganger anyway.

1778
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:51,980
Because, say we let the first two in, because they were
correct, was so perfect.

1779
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:57,580
Well, it would have had to been the doppelganger.

1780
01:52:58,420 --> 01:52:58,620
You know?

1781
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:01,440
Anyway.

1782
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:04,240
Bye-bye.

1783
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:32,540
Oh, Oh.

1784
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:36,820
Hmm.

1785
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:39,800
I don't...

1786
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:41,260
Oh, she is on the list.

1787
01:53:41,740 --> 01:53:43,220
That's why she went outside.

1788
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:44,460
Because she was on the list.

1789
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:45,800
Have a nice day.

1790
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:54,180
Oh, no, she's French.

1791
01:53:58,640 --> 01:53:59,520
Good afternoon.

1792
01:54:02,020 --> 01:54:03,380
Good afternoon, Angus.

1793
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:05,820
See, Priya.

1794
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:06,880
Well, okay, you know what?

1795
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:09,560
I did ask earlier, I think, if the name's going to be
misspelled.

1796
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,360
And that answers my question, doesn't it?

1797
01:54:12,460 --> 01:54:13,160
The person before.

1798
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:16,440
What do you mean by that?

1799
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:18,920
What do you mean by that?

1800
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:21,840
103.

1801
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:24,420
Long neck.

1802
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:27,400
Where's a hat?

1803
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:32,940
Has a mustache and small eyes.

1804
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:36,440
He's a businessman.

1805
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:38,140
565.

1806
01:54:38,860 --> 01:54:39,820
003.

1807
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:42,840
69845.

1808
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:44,540
Looks good to me.

1809
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:44,900
me.

1810
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:46,820
Except.

1811
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:49,940
Except.

1812
01:54:51,540 --> 01:54:52,280
Oh, sir.

1813
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:54,160
Oh, no, sir.

1814
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:56,600
You are quite suspicious.

1815
01:54:58,180 --> 01:55:03,160
If I do say so myself, but I will call your home and see.

1816
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:04,640
Five, five, one, three.

1817
01:55:11,090 --> 01:55:11,570
Oh,

1818
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:19,310
I thought someone picked up for a second.

1819
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:26,210
I wouldn't trust anyone with that smile.

1820
01:55:27,050 --> 01:55:29,770
Look, you can't judge a book by its cover, okay?

1821
01:55:30,670 --> 01:55:34,330
This guy, he's just Angus Capriani.

1822
01:55:36,650 --> 01:55:37,730
Wait, what floor was he?

1823
01:55:37,770 --> 01:55:38,290
Oh, first floor.

1824
01:55:39,650 --> 01:55:40,810
Angus Capriani.

1825
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:47,450
You are under arrest for tax evasion.

1826
01:55:51,710 --> 01:55:53,290
So far, I think we're doing pretty well.

1827
01:55:55,330 --> 01:55:56,430
I think we're doing well, you guys.

1828
01:55:56,530 --> 01:55:58,250
I think we're going to get this F for sure.

1829
01:56:00,830 --> 01:56:02,730
I think we're going to get it for sure.

1830
01:56:03,070 --> 01:56:08,470
You can continue your job.

1831
01:56:10,890 --> 01:56:11,650
Thank you!

1832
01:56:13,810 --> 01:56:14,570
Thank you.

1833
01:56:15,430 --> 01:56:19,890
Here, boss, I'm taking responsibility for accidentally
gaslighting you

1834
01:56:24,110 --> 01:56:28,810
I hope you can get some well-deserved rest after the stream
is over and have a great weekend.

1835
01:56:28,990 --> 01:56:29,630
You too!

1836
01:56:29,890 --> 01:56:30,650
Thank you!

1837
01:56:30,970 --> 01:56:31,830
Thank you so much.

1838
01:56:32,510 --> 01:56:33,450
Thank you, thank you.

1839
01:56:34,490 --> 01:56:36,050
We got Francis back.

1840
01:56:36,890 --> 01:56:38,330
He's a milkman.

1841
01:56:40,170 --> 01:56:41,830
He's on the list.

1842
01:56:43,530 --> 01:56:44,870
Heretic, thanks for the 10 gifted!

1843

1854
01:58:16,790 --> 01:58:17,090
Natcha!

1855
01:58:18,430 --> 01:58:21,810
Natcha, how are you doing today, Natcha?

1856
01:58:22,830 --> 01:58:23,070
Oh.

1857
01:58:25,290 --> 01:58:26,990

1858
01:58:28,110 --> 01:58:28,990
Yeah?

1859
01:58:30,450 --> 01:58:33,410
Natcha, I mean, usually people just say, I'm fine.

1860
01:58:36,090 --> 01:58:38,870
No need to trauma dump on me or anything.

1861
01:58:39,050 --> 01:58:39,730
I get it.

1862
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:43,530
Alright, let's just let her in.

1863
01:58:43,710 --> 01:58:44,630
Let her have a...

1864
01:58:44,630 --> 01:58:46,090
You know, get some rest nacha!

1865
01:58:47,150 --> 01:58:48,650
Those will heal eventually.

1866
01:58:49,050 --> 01:58:49,490
Don't worry.

1867
01:58:58,030 --> 01:58:58,470
Reptillion.

1868
01:59:00,770 --> 01:59:01,210
Capacino.

1869
01:59:02,990 --> 01:59:03,970
I'm arisen in this building.

1870
01:59:04,050 --> 01:59:05,330

1877
01:59:42,870 --> 01:59:43,970
She's too perfect.

1878
01:59:44,830 --> 01:59:45,930
She's too perfect.

1879
01:59:47,910 --> 01:59:49,290
Didn't this lady show up earlier?

1880
01:59:49,730 --> 01:59:50,050
Did she?

1881
01:59:50,190 --> 01:59:50,850
I can't remember.

1882
01:59:51,050 --> 01:59:53,010
The games are bleeding into each other.

1883
01:59:56,630 --> 01:59:59,930
I'm interested in what would happen if you call since you
let her other in.

1884
02:00:00,710 --> 02:00:01,490
Let's try it.

1885
02:00:02,010 --> 02:00:02,530
Who is it?

1886
02:00:02,550 --> 02:00:03,830
1-3-4-6.

1887
02:00:05,530 --> 02:00:06,170
1-3-4-6.

1888
02:00:06,550 --> 02:00:09,850
Three, four, six.

1889
02:00:24,550 --> 02:00:26,850
Yeah, see, we just let her in.

1890
02:00:28,370 --> 02:00:31,350
Oh, she wasn't on the list.

1891
02:00:31,470 --> 02:00:36,390
For some reason, I was confusing her with Natcha, so I was
like, wait, but you were on the list for real, actually.

1892
02:00:39,230 --> 02:00:41,390
Hey, Mintz, it's my friend Chris's birthday.

1893
02:00:42,170 --> 02:00:44,290
It would make him very happy if you could sing him Happy
Birthday.

1894
02:00:45,050 --> 02:00:46,930
Also, Simba, thank you for that birthday gift.

1895
02:00:47,070 --> 02:00:48,050
Thank you so much.

1896
02:00:50,290 --> 02:00:51,810
Happy birthday.

1897
02:00:52,910 --> 02:00:54,290
Hold on.

1898
02:00:56,250 --> 02:00:56,750
Okay, one more time.

1899
02:00:56,850 --> 02:00:57,030
One more time.

1900
02:00:57,650 --> 02:00:58,690
One more time.

1901
02:00:58,690 --> 02:01:01,550
Happy birthday to you.

1902
02:01:02,390 --> 02:01:05,450
Happy birthday to you.

1903
02:01:06,310 --> 02:01:09,670
Happy birthday, dear Chris.

1904
02:01:18,470 --> 02:01:19,750
to you.

1905
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:25,000
Yay!

1906
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:28,000
Happy birthday.

1907
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:30,280
This lady looks good, doesn't she?

1908
02:01:39,270 --> 02:01:42,750
Lots of lots of humans today, eh?

1909
02:01:43,550 --> 02:01:44,710
Ugh, it's exhausting.

1910
02:01:45,630 --> 02:01:47,890
Really giving the DDD a run for their money.

1911
02:01:50,250 --> 02:01:50,490
Wait.

1912
02:01:52,230 --> 02:01:54,170
Humans, it's my friend Chris's birthday.

1913
02:01:56,270 --> 02:01:59,510
It would make him very happy if you could sing him happy
birthday.

1914
02:02:01,970 --> 02:02:02,470
What?

1915
02:02:04,090 --> 02:02:06,370
It's definitely not the same Chris.

1916
02:02:09,170 --> 02:02:09,450
Huh?

1917
02:02:10,250 --> 02:02:11,990
Can't you use the same one though?

1918
02:02:14,370 --> 02:02:14,870
What?

1919
02:02:16,090 --> 02:02:17,970
Yeah, is it a doppelganger Chris?

1920
02:02:20,170 --> 02:02:23,050
Does your Chris have a mole on his left side or his right
side?

1921
02:02:24,650 --> 02:02:25,790
Hello, Nacha.

1922
02:02:26,530 --> 02:02:30,790
Actually, I feel like we can automatically let this lady in.

1923
02:02:31,490 --> 02:02:36,510
Because we already called before and we saw that Natcha was
at home.

1924
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:37,670
You know?

1925
02:02:40,530 --> 02:02:41,810
Right eye blue.

1926
02:02:42,670 --> 02:02:43,510
Left eye green.

1927
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:48,180
No DDD.

1928
02:02:48,380 --> 02:02:48,920
Oh, you're right.

1929
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:50,000
No DDD logo.

1930
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:51,820
Let her in.

1931
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:55,480
Yeah, we'll just let her in.

1932
02:02:58,460 --> 02:02:59,280
What's in bad?

1933
02:02:59,460 --> 02:03:00,640
Thank you for another 50!

1934
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:02,880
Thank you so much!

1935
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:03,940
Thank you!

1936
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:10,840
Oh my goodness, you guys have gotten insane with the
members, don't knows, everything.

1937
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:13,480
This lady, she looks different.

1938
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:14,200
Ah!

1939
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:17,400
Her mouth is down.

1940
02:03:18,420 --> 02:03:19,280
I want to ask.

1941
02:03:20,340 --> 02:03:21,800
What's wrong with my appearance?

1942
02:03:23,380 --> 02:03:24,260
She looks different.

1943
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:27,560
Look carefully at the photos of my papers and compare them
well with them.

1944
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:30,340
I don't remember where she lived.

1945
02:03:32,060 --> 02:03:32,240
Oh, wait.

1946
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:34,720
You also didn't give me your entry request.

1947
02:03:35,740 --> 02:03:36,820
Here's my entry request.

1948
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:37,460
Thank you.

1949
02:03:40,140 --> 02:03:40,620
304.

1950
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:44,080
Yeah, see, even it's supposed to be way up.

1951
02:03:45,380 --> 02:03:46,760
It's supposed to be way, way up.

1952
02:03:50,660 --> 02:03:51,140
Lady!

1953
02:03:53,780 --> 02:03:54,960
Have a nice day!

1954
02:04:00,670 --> 02:04:01,270
Mm-hmm.

1955
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:03,230
This is an easy job.

1956
02:04:03,670 --> 02:04:05,010
Mr. Hofton.

1957
02:04:07,390 --> 02:04:08,390
71.

1958
02:04:09,090 --> 02:04:09,990
The DDD.

1959
02:04:12,070 --> 02:04:12,930
Pharmacist.

1960
02:04:14,590 --> 02:04:16,510
Wait, where did you live again?

1961
02:04:17,390 --> 02:04:18,230
Oh, 301.

1962
02:04:20,430 --> 02:04:21,430
Physicist!

1963
02:04:22,450 --> 02:04:22,990
Oh!

1964
02:04:23,670 --> 02:04:24,170
Wait.

1965
02:04:26,110 --> 02:04:27,070
Oh, physicist.

1966
02:04:30,460 --> 02:04:33,420
I think I'm regressing.

1967
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:43,700
you know it took a lot of energy going from heaven back to
manifesting as a ghost but you know maybe i'm losing so much

1968
02:04:43,700 --> 02:04:53,120
ghostly energy that i'm reverting back into like a like a
wisp thanks for singing for me i was too shy to ask myself

1969
02:04:53,120 --> 02:05:04,940
and your fans are absolutely evil in the nicest way possible
of course chris if that's really you free supas now First

1970
02:05:04,940 --> 02:05:06,340
name is Dr. W.

1971
02:05:06,700 --> 02:05:08,200
Absolutely, Dr. W.

1972
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:08,700
Afton.

1973
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:10,580
All right, 250.

1974
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:15,060
489.656.

1975
02:05:15,980 --> 02:05:17,200
489.656.

1976
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:18,600
214.

1977
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:19,480
214.

1978
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:21,340
And I'm pretty sure he was on the list.

1979
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:23,900
So him being out would make sense.

1980
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:26,360
I think we've called even.

1981
02:05:26,680 --> 02:05:27,180
1425.

1982
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:31,300
1425.

1983
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:32,540
Five.

1984
02:05:39,810 --> 02:05:40,850
Nope.

1985
02:05:42,230 --> 02:05:46,550
I think we're good to deny.

1986
02:05:49,530 --> 02:05:55,630
Three, three, one, two, that's the call.

1987
02:05:56,710 --> 02:06:03,650
You are never coming back home.

1988
02:06:05,650 --> 02:06:11,090
Those don't rhyme, but that's okay.

1989
02:06:12,070 --> 02:06:18,290
I won't survive the end of the day.

1990
02:06:18,970 --> 02:06:21,830
Three, three, one, two.

1991
02:06:23,450 --> 02:06:23,830
Oh!

1992
02:06:24,050 --> 02:06:25,870
You again!

1993
02:06:27,310 --> 02:06:30,330
Oh my gosh, your place is gonna be so crowded, madam.

1994
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:32,190
Reptilian.

1995
02:06:33,250 --> 02:06:34,310
Your appearance.

1996
02:06:34,670 --> 02:06:35,630
Oh, that's right.

1997
02:06:35,650 --> 02:06:36,930
What's wrong with my appearance?

1998
02:06:37,490 --> 02:06:38,150
I'm just saying.

1999
02:06:40,650 --> 02:06:41,690
Yeah, I did.

2000
02:06:43,550 --> 02:06:45,650
I already answered their question.

2001
02:06:47,490 --> 02:06:48,850
Three times.

2002
02:06:50,590 --> 02:06:50,850
Okay.

2003
02:06:51,490 --> 02:06:52,570
Works for me then.

2004
02:06:55,230 --> 02:06:56,670
She's so popular.

2005
02:06:57,870 --> 02:06:59,230
She's the beauty standard.

2006
02:07:01,570 --> 02:07:01,930
Okay.

2007
02:07:02,590 --> 02:07:03,270
Moment of truth.

2008
02:07:03,870 --> 02:07:04,130
F!

2009
02:07:04,410 --> 02:07:04,610
F!

2010
02:07:04,890 --> 02:07:05,250
F!

2011
02:07:05,650 --> 02:07:08,730
F, F, F, F, F, F.

2012
02:07:09,390 --> 02:07:10,910
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2013
02:07:10,910 --> 02:07:11,590
Oh, dead.

2014
02:07:12,210 --> 02:07:12,810
People killed.

2015
02:07:16,870 --> 02:07:17,190
Yeah!

2016
02:07:20,790 --> 02:07:21,750
Oh, yeah!

2017
02:07:22,570 --> 02:07:23,230
Oh, yeah!

2018
02:07:23,230 --> 02:07:23,690
Yippee!

2019
02:07:25,230 --> 02:07:27,270
Oh, not just, I was like, scar.

2020
02:07:28,050 --> 02:07:29,370
All right!

2021
02:07:32,350 --> 02:07:33,230
Let's go!

2022
02:07:33,610 --> 02:07:34,710
Seven is crazy.

2023
02:07:34,830 --> 02:07:35,330
I know.

2024
02:07:37,130 --> 02:07:39,610
We killed 10 people.

2025
02:07:42,990 --> 02:07:44,150
Nice, nice, nice.

2026
02:07:44,330 --> 02:07:47,290
That should also give us another record too, though, right?

2027
02:07:47,750 --> 02:07:48,860
If we go back to the menu.

2028
02:07:51,690 --> 02:07:52,310
Wow.

2029
02:07:54,550 --> 02:07:56,550
Yeah, kill an innocent neighbor.

2030
02:07:57,010 --> 02:07:57,870
Get the F.

2031
02:07:59,650 --> 02:08:01,090
Let's go, baby.

2032
02:08:01,950 --> 02:08:02,590
What is...

2033
02:08:02,590 --> 02:08:04,170
I still want to get Peach.

2034
02:08:06,070 --> 02:08:12,030
doppelganger red-handed how how do you do that

2035
02:08:15,410 --> 02:08:20,390
scar is an interesting way to say entire face stitched shut
right

2036
02:08:27,690 --> 02:08:38,510
you ask questions oh by questioning them oh okay okay okay
let's try um a few more maybe we'll get peaches or maybe

2037
02:08:38,510 --> 02:08:50,270
these are kind of they're kind of longer so I don't mind
that I kind of like that they don't it doesn't necessarily

2038
02:08:50,270 --> 02:09:07,230
need a story it's just kind of like you play all right nice
now we're playing again for real wait there was also the

2039
02:09:07,230 --> 02:09:11,030
what was it the one where you don't touch any folders.

2040
02:09:11,990 --> 02:09:14,770
So basically I can't touch any of these, right?

2041
02:09:15,910 --> 02:09:16,580
And I have to...

2042
02:09:17,930 --> 02:09:18,470
Right?

2043
02:09:19,050 --> 02:09:20,680
I said no folders, so...

2044
02:09:22,410 --> 02:09:24,570
I'm assuming I can look at this.

2045
02:09:30,470 --> 02:09:31,550
Steel memory.

2046
02:09:33,690 --> 02:09:34,370
Uh-oh.

2047
02:09:34,490 --> 02:09:35,370
What was his phone number?

2048
02:09:37,230 --> 02:09:37,770
Wait!

2049
02:09:38,550 --> 02:09:39,850
Whoa, Mr. Afton!

2050
02:09:40,650 --> 02:09:42,370
What was your phone number?

2051
02:09:43,550 --> 02:09:45,890
I'm a resident of the building.

2052
02:09:46,150 --> 02:09:50,570
I'm not on today's list because I had to leave Dudo at an
emergency at work.

2053
02:09:53,570 --> 02:09:56,590
3-3-1-2, you're not gonna get me this time.

2054
02:09:58,810 --> 02:09:59,330
1971.

2055
02:10:01,390 --> 02:10:02,330
No logo!

2056
02:10:02,810 --> 02:10:03,990
No logo, no logo!

2057
02:10:04,130 --> 02:10:05,830
No logo, no entry, mister.

2058
02:10:06,210 --> 02:10:07,310
No logo, no entry!

2059
02:10:14,340 --> 02:10:15,380
Hmm, hmm.

2060
02:10:19,540 --> 02:10:20,080
Nice.

2061
02:10:25,480 --> 02:10:29,100
This is like evil Animal Crossing speak.

2062
02:10:30,980 --> 02:10:33,060
Like anti-animal crossing, anti-cute.

2063
02:10:37,550 --> 02:10:38,710
Oh, oh!

2064
02:10:41,670 --> 02:10:42,770
Oh no!

2065
02:10:45,170 --> 02:10:47,450
Romans, Tilsky, what happened to you?

2066
02:10:50,030 --> 02:10:51,690
What happened to you?

2067
02:10:53,690 --> 02:10:55,150
I don't mean to...

2068
02:10:55,150 --> 02:10:56,710
I mean, it's a little...

2069
02:10:56,710 --> 02:10:58,510
I look like I always do.

2070
02:10:58,690 --> 02:11:02,790
It's a little rude to say, like, Hey, what's wrong with your
face?

2071
02:11:03,410 --> 02:11:06,610
But, you know, it's just kind of like a...

2072
02:11:06,610 --> 02:11:09,130
It's just a little, you know...

2073
02:11:17,010 --> 02:11:20,810
Poor guy went to the doctors today and we're sending him to
jail.

2074
02:11:22,210 --> 02:11:24,830
He's just like, please, I don't feel so well.

2075
02:11:25,910 --> 02:11:28,370
I just want to go home and relax.

2076
02:11:33,170 --> 02:11:34,290
Thank you.

2077
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:40,900
He wasn't even on the list.

2078
02:11:44,100 --> 02:11:45,020
Hello, Peach Man.

2079
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:48,080

2086
02:12:56,810 --> 02:12:57,330
Okay.

2087
02:12:59,830 --> 02:13:00,510
Good afternoon.

2088
02:13:01,350 --> 02:13:01,670
Arnold.

2089
02:13:02,930 --> 02:13:05,450
We remember that he is always wearing a hat.

2090
02:13:07,670 --> 02:13:08,130
1971.

2091
02:13:08,690 --> 02:13:09,450
Got the logo.

2092
02:13:11,010 --> 02:13:12,410
Murphy, thanks for the 10 gifted.

2093
02:13:15,870 --> 02:13:18,150
All according to Japanese word for plan.

2094
02:13:18,830 --> 02:13:19,350
Keikaku.

2095
02:13:20,590 --> 02:13:21,710
Means plan.

2096
02:13:22,090 --> 02:13:23,010
Oh, was he a writer?

2097
02:13:23,770 --> 02:13:25,410
Or did he work at the bank?

2098
02:13:26,830 --> 02:13:29,190
I work at the bank.

2099
02:13:31,570 --> 02:13:32,870
Who was the accountant?

2100
02:13:33,570 --> 02:13:34,590
Roman is the accountant.

2101
02:13:35,330 --> 02:13:38,930
And I think Arnold's wife is the banker.

2102
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:41,510
He is a writer.

2103
02:13:42,930 --> 02:13:45,350
Getter, thanks for the five gifted.

2104
02:13:45,950 --> 02:13:48,250
Ducky, thanks for the five gifted.

2105
02:13:49,410 --> 02:13:50,170
Thank you, thank you.

2106
02:13:51,230 --> 02:13:53,690
Okay, I think we're just going to have to let this guy in
then.

2107
02:13:57,460 --> 02:13:58,920
He's on the list too, right?

2108
02:14:00,440 --> 02:14:00,620
Yep.

2109
02:14:02,340 --> 02:14:02,640
201.

2110
02:14:05,980 --> 02:14:07,120
So everything is in order?

2111
02:14:09,820 --> 02:14:11,500
I hate people that work at the bank.

2112
02:14:12,940 --> 02:14:15,100
I work at the bank.

2113
02:14:15,220 --> 02:14:16,600
Takisō, thanks for the vibe, Captain.

2114
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:19,460
Little Luhu, thank you for the 50.

2115
02:14:20,860 --> 02:14:22,780
Fun comics, thank you for the 5.

2116
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:23,460
Why?

2117
02:14:25,240 --> 02:14:28,860
Oh, Sean, thank you for the 10 turtles.

2118
02:14:29,320 --> 02:14:30,080
Thank you for the 20.

2119
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:32,620
Okay, let's just let him in.

2120
02:14:36,760 --> 02:14:38,900
Do you have to get a perfect run to get the achievement?

2121
02:14:39,080 --> 02:14:39,760
You do, yeah.

2122
02:14:43,020 --> 02:14:43,380
Hello.

2123
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:45,080
Oh, gosh, we haven't seen this lady.

2124
02:14:49,750 --> 02:14:51,750
Like, we've only seen her, like, one time.

2125
02:14:51,970 --> 02:14:54,730
But we can compare her appearance with this.

2126
02:14:56,550 --> 02:14:57,270
Looks good.

2127
02:14:57,410 --> 02:14:59,270
Looking good, Lois, and Joko.

2128
02:14:59,590 --> 02:15:01,150
Joko's, thank you for the 10.

2129
02:15:03,450 --> 02:15:04,830
KVAR, thanks for the five.

2130
02:15:05,250 --> 02:15:06,690
McVack, thanks for the 10.

2131
02:15:07,930 --> 02:15:08,690
Tag out.

2132
02:15:09,990 --> 02:15:12,190
Guys, Lois, Stinky.

2133
02:15:13,790 --> 02:15:14,270
1969.

2134
02:15:15,870 --> 02:15:17,050
I'm a resident of this building.

2135
02:15:17,130 --> 02:15:18,170
I went out to visit my mother.

2136
02:15:18,330 --> 02:15:21,750
We got the DDD logos.

2137
02:15:24,810 --> 02:15:26,290
Yeah, thanks for the five.

2138
02:15:28,230 --> 02:15:28,750
Stingy.

2139
02:15:29,970 --> 02:15:31,070
I think she's good.

2140
02:15:31,250 --> 02:15:31,990
I think she's good.

2141
02:15:32,910 --> 02:15:36,410
From what we can tell, I think she's okay.

2142
02:15:42,540 --> 02:15:44,760
That's all we can try.

2143
02:15:45,580 --> 02:15:47,060
Patkun takes her to the 10.

2144
02:15:51,740 --> 02:15:52,260
Hello.

2145
02:15:54,240 --> 02:15:54,760
Margaret.

2146
02:15:56,320 --> 02:15:57,260
Missa Bubbles.

2147
02:15:57,480 --> 02:15:58,700
Shin, thanks for the 10.

2148
02:15:58,820 --> 02:15:59,740
Kenja takes her to the 5.

2149
02:16:00,100 --> 02:16:00,960
Thank you guys.

2150
02:16:04,020 --> 02:16:04,980
Let's see.

2151
02:16:06,440 --> 02:16:07,200
Day, day, date.

2152
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:07,840
1975.

2153
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:13,420
We haven't got, we've had the expiration date missing, but
we have not had it incorrect.

2154
02:16:14,180 --> 02:16:14,480
Day, day, day.

2155
02:16:15,740 --> 02:16:18,580
I went out for my job as a seamstress.

2156
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:27,520
Is she a seamstress?

2157
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:30,280
I don't know.

2158
02:16:30,900 --> 02:16:34,460
I don't, I don't remember if she was a seamstress or not.

2159
02:16:35,160 --> 02:16:36,840
Also, let's check her nose.

2160
02:16:36,860 --> 02:16:38,140
Her nose is good.

2161
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:39,400
Her face is good.

2162
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:42,020
My brow's good.

2163
02:16:49,510 --> 02:16:50,710
Seam stressed.

2164
02:16:51,530 --> 02:16:54,150
That is actually so true of seam stresses.

2165
02:16:57,370 --> 02:16:59,150
You are not on the list.

2166
02:16:59,630 --> 02:17:00,030
Oh gosh.

2167
02:17:00,390 --> 02:17:00,690
Uh-oh.

2168
02:17:03,550 --> 02:17:05,010
And to leave due to an emergency.

2169
02:17:08,390 --> 02:17:09,270
Why is it?

2170
02:17:09,290 --> 02:17:09,990
glitching out.

2171
02:17:11,170 --> 02:17:13,370
I think it is correct though, her eye color.

2172
02:17:13,610 --> 02:17:15,290
I can't remember her nose at all though.

2173
02:17:16,210 --> 02:17:17,650
I can't remember her nose.

2174
02:17:17,970 --> 02:17:20,250
Oh nose, oh nose, oh nose, oh nose.

2175
02:17:20,350 --> 02:17:22,170
I came for my job as a chef.

2176
02:17:22,770 --> 02:17:25,070
What kind of chef emergency was there?

2177
02:17:31,660 --> 02:17:37,040
I keep thinking the flying dust in the game is my dirty
screen.

2178
02:17:40,440 --> 02:17:42,060
Wrong nose it is.

2179
02:17:43,300 --> 02:17:45,320
We don't have a reference over here.

2180
02:17:45,900 --> 02:17:48,760
And we also can't call because probably her daughter's out.

2181
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:49,900
Kiyoma, thanks for the 10.

2182
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:52,040
Ellie, welcome to membership.

2183
02:17:52,260 --> 02:17:53,120
Thank you.

2184
02:18:00,850 --> 02:18:02,890
I don't think their nose is wrong.

2185
02:18:05,970 --> 02:18:07,150
She should be in though if you call.

2186
02:18:07,410 --> 02:18:08,510
Oh, true, true, true, true.

2187
02:18:08,930 --> 02:18:09,970
No, she was a chef.

2188
02:18:10,970 --> 02:18:12,470
She was a chef for sure.

2189
02:18:14,090 --> 02:18:16,390
It's Emma Stone that's a teacher.

2190
02:18:22,350 --> 02:18:22,490
Okay.

2191
02:18:22,510 --> 02:18:24,730
Does anybody remember the phone number?

2192
02:18:25,090 --> 02:18:26,630
Oh, question her more.

2193
02:18:28,350 --> 02:18:28,450
Oh.

2194
02:18:30,810 --> 02:18:31,270
My ID?

2195
02:18:33,410 --> 02:18:35,050
I don't see anything wrong with my ID.

2196
02:18:38,980 --> 02:18:39,060
Okay.

2197
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:40,180
A parent.

2198
02:18:40,700 --> 02:18:41,680
What's wrong with my parents?

2199
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:45,620
She seems so happy about me, like, really interrogating her.

2200
02:18:46,700 --> 02:18:48,080
I'm a little...

2201
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:51,500
I enter your request.

2202
02:18:53,020 --> 02:18:53,960
I don't see anything wrong.

2203
02:18:53,980 --> 02:19:03,860
wrong with my entry why did she say the same thing every
time nanoplasm thank you i was just wondering if you got

2204
02:19:03,860 --> 02:19:05,540
your moguls minted

2205
02:19:08,960 --> 02:19:19,530
moguls minted i don't remember the rest

2206
02:19:23,110 --> 02:19:29,950
i think she's good i think hopefully I should probably have
changed it so that if you get it wrong, it kills you

2207
02:19:29,950 --> 02:19:30,430
immediately.

2208
02:19:31,970 --> 02:19:34,010
So we don't have to suffer through the entire thing.

2209
02:19:35,890 --> 02:19:35,910
Oh!

2210
02:19:37,210 --> 02:19:38,290
Hi, or whatever.

2211
02:19:38,930 --> 02:19:39,490
Give me your ID.

2212
02:19:40,910 --> 02:19:42,090
I forgot to show my ID.

2213
02:19:44,410 --> 02:19:44,770
Whatever.

2214
02:19:46,110 --> 02:19:46,470
Anastacha.

2215
02:19:47,910 --> 02:19:49,130
Okay, we got the DDD.

2216
02:19:50,010 --> 02:19:50,370
1995.

2217
02:19:50,690 --> 02:19:50,970
DDD.

2218
02:19:51,490 --> 02:19:52,190
I live here, whatever.

2219
02:19:52,370 --> 02:19:53,390
I come from school.

2220
02:19:53,550 --> 02:19:55,270
We do know that she is a student.

2221
02:19:55,270 --> 02:20:05,830

2227

Hair stranding.

2228
02:21:20,180 --> 02:21:20,780
Oh, hello!

2229
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:23,220
Good afternoon, Angus.

2230
02:21:25,480 --> 02:21:26,080
Okay.

2231
02:21:27,940 --> 02:21:29,340
He's a businessman.

2232
02:21:30,140 --> 02:21:31,720
We didn't know that about you.

2233
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:36,740
I'm nervous because I feel like we're not catching a lot of
things, you know?

2234
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:39,120
I feel like we're...

2235
02:21:41,720 --> 02:21:43,420
I don't know.

2236
02:21:44,160 --> 02:21:45,720
It looked like I'm picking his teeth.

2237
02:21:46,780 --> 02:21:47,100
Um.

2238
02:21:48,440 --> 02:21:49,000
Oh.

2239
02:21:53,740 --> 02:21:56,380
A businessman with a business plan.

2240
02:21:56,580 --> 02:21:57,720
Chris is doppelganger!

2241
02:21:58,540 --> 02:21:58,980
Hello.

2242
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:01,200
Um.

2243
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:01,740
Um.

2244
02:22:02,140 --> 02:22:02,400
Wait.

2245
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:04,060
How do I know you're a doppelganger?

2246
02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:07,040
Anyone can say that they're the doppelganger.

2247
02:22:08,360 --> 02:22:08,520
But.

2248
02:22:09,300 --> 02:22:10,300
How will I know?

2249
02:22:10,620 --> 02:22:12,200
Prove yourself wrong.

2250
02:22:14,500 --> 02:22:16,300
Uh, 3-3-1-2.

2251
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:21,120
I think we just gotta let this guy in.

2252
02:22:25,660 --> 02:22:26,100
Next.

2253
02:22:31,380 --> 02:22:33,080
Good afternoon, old man.

2254
02:22:33,880 --> 02:22:35,320
Wait, I don't know you at all.

2255
02:22:36,100 --> 02:22:36,540
Uh-oh.

2256
02:22:37,180 --> 02:22:37,900
Uh-oh.

2257
02:22:38,100 --> 02:22:39,460
Wait, I don't...

2258
02:22:39,460 --> 02:22:40,560
Oh, no, it's Alf!

2259
02:22:41,080 --> 02:22:43,020
We've never met Alf before!

2260
02:22:43,900 --> 02:22:44,340
Uh-oh.

2261
02:22:46,960 --> 02:22:50,000
Maybe it's too hard to do the steel difficulty.

2262
02:22:51,380 --> 02:22:51,640
Uh-oh.

2263
02:22:52,380 --> 02:22:53,300
Uh-oh.

2264
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:55,180
We don't know, Alf.

2265
02:22:57,960 --> 02:23:00,200
Am I not on today's list?

2266
02:23:00,340 --> 02:23:01,200
You are not!

2267
02:23:02,380 --> 02:23:03,680
I think there's an error.

2268
02:23:03,960 --> 02:23:04,960
I should be on the list.

2269
02:23:06,500 --> 02:23:08,100
Look at the list again.

2270
02:23:09,100 --> 02:23:15,680
Are you saying that I made a mistake, Mr. No date?

2271
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:20,860
You guys are so good.

2272
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:23,780
You guys are so good.

2273
02:23:26,920 --> 02:23:27,520
Nice.

2274
02:23:31,040 --> 02:23:32,580
Get out of here, Alfie boy.

2275
02:23:36,580 --> 02:23:37,500
Yes.

2276
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:39,980
Squeaky clean.

2277
02:23:41,180 --> 02:23:43,220
As if he were never here.

2278
02:23:43,980 --> 02:23:46,300
Not even a single debris.

2279
02:23:46,320 --> 02:23:48,740
of flesh left.

2280
02:23:52,720 --> 02:23:53,960
Hello, where's your ID?

2281
02:23:55,160 --> 02:23:56,320
Here's my ID.

2282
02:23:57,620 --> 02:23:59,260
Miss Illinois.

2283
02:24:01,140 --> 02:24:03,400
Okay, we got the day, the D, D, D.

2284
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:06,900
Let's make sure the name is spelled correctly.

2285
02:24:07,860 --> 02:24:10,780
It's for Yep.

2286
02:24:11,960 --> 02:24:13,100
Job is a model.

2287
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:14,980
Resident of the building.

2288
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:17,500
I think so.

2289
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:18,480
I think so.

2290
02:24:18,580 --> 02:24:19,080
I think so.

2291
02:24:20,380 --> 02:24:21,320
Goodbye, Monopoly Man.

2292
02:24:21,780 --> 02:24:24,800
Does the Monopoly Man not have an iPod or a monocle?

2293
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:29,160
It's not like one of those Mandela effect things.

2294
02:24:30,400 --> 02:24:32,800
She's got the mole on the right side.

2295
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:35,440
She's looking good.

2296
02:24:39,100 --> 02:24:40,500
He never did.

2297
02:24:40,680 --> 02:24:42,080
Yeah, he never had a monocle.

2298
02:24:45,240 --> 02:24:46,260
But a lot of people think...

2299
02:24:46,320 --> 02:24:47,280
You had one.

2300
02:24:47,860 --> 02:24:48,800
Thanks, K-Barn!

2301
02:24:49,140 --> 02:24:49,640
Silly chat.

2302
02:24:49,780 --> 02:24:50,360
Supas aren't free.

2303
02:24:50,480 --> 02:24:52,660
Stream labs, though, are totally free.

2304
02:24:55,240 --> 02:24:56,580
I think she's good.

2305
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:05,320
It's hard when you can't call to confirm that the person's
there or not.

2306
02:25:06,300 --> 02:25:06,440
Oh!

2307
02:25:07,640 --> 02:25:08,100
Oh!

2308
02:25:11,860 --> 02:25:13,680
Milkman, milkman, milkman.

2309
02:25:14,860 --> 02:25:16,220
Did you stretch them to here?

2310
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:21,560
Oh my gosh, thank you.

2311
02:25:21,700 --> 02:25:22,480
Welcome to membership.

2312
02:25:23,720 --> 02:25:24,200
Stop.

2313
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:28,180
Thank you so much.

2314
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:31,120
Bunny for Sona Bag.

2315
02:25:33,940 --> 02:25:35,640
I want to nibble on those.

2316
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:38,740
When people say they like big ears, this is what they mean.

2317
02:25:40,620 --> 02:25:42,080
Pointy ears are a thing of the past.

2318
02:25:42,220 --> 02:25:43,760
It's all about the lobes now.

2319
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:47,880
We're here for long lobes.

2320
02:25:48,700 --> 02:25:49,180
Long lobes.

2321
02:25:49,820 --> 02:25:50,200
Long lobes.

2322
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:51,280
Long lobes.

2323
02:25:51,640 --> 02:25:52,160
Yeah!

2324
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:57,000

2325
02:26:00,400 --> 02:26:00,940

2326
02:26:04,140 --> 02:26:04,740
Sorry.

2327
02:26:05,260 --> 02:26:09,680
Last time I was able to let you in, but this time I must
reject you, Mr. Lobes.

2328
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:16,300

little excited there's something in you that stirs something

2337
02:27:01,740 --> 02:27:03,200
Go on in, goose.

2338
02:27:05,740 --> 02:27:08,200
I heard supers were free, so here's why.

2339
02:27:08,680 --> 02:27:11,560
You have heard incorrectly, Raisin, but thank you.

2340
02:27:15,480 --> 02:27:16,080
Who?

2341
02:27:18,960 --> 02:27:20,340
What is the meaning of life?

2342
02:27:20,340 --> 02:27:22,340
the universe and everything else.

2343
02:27:23,740 --> 02:27:24,580
Oh, 42!

2344
02:27:28,040 --> 02:27:29,240
That's correct!

2345
02:27:31,540 --> 02:27:37,840
What is the scientific name of the Australian animal that
drastically changes its appearance when removed from its

2346
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:39,100
natural habitat?

2347
02:27:39,580 --> 02:27:40,680
Oh, this is the quiz!

2348
02:27:41,180 --> 02:27:42,180
Oh my gosh, we got the quiz!

2349
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:46,440
Huh?

2350
02:27:49,340 --> 02:27:50,020
Camellia?

2351
02:27:50,340 --> 02:27:50,980
I thought.

2352
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:54,080
Is a chameleon Australian?

2353
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:57,520
The drop bear.

2354
02:27:58,920 --> 02:27:59,620
Octopus?

2355
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:02,900
Oh my gosh, the audio is getting kind of freaky.

2356
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:07,500
Scientific name.

2357
02:28:14,830 --> 02:28:16,110
Made mint.

2358
02:28:19,250 --> 02:28:20,470
Quick to Google.

2359
02:28:20,670 --> 02:28:22,090
Okay, Google, Google, Google.

2360
02:28:24,470 --> 02:28:34,370
scientific scientific name of the Australian oh my gosh

2361
02:28:39,020 --> 02:28:44,740
the Australian animal that drastically changes its
appearance when removed from its habitat is the echidna

2362
02:28:44,740 --> 02:28:54,640
scientifically known as the is the echidna sonic hedgehog
tatachi tatachi

2363
02:28:59,820 --> 02:29:01,220
Aeculiatus.

2364
02:29:02,420 --> 02:29:03,820
No!

2365
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:17,400
But this was an expert verified answer from Google!

2366
02:29:26,220 --> 02:29:29,260
This is the dog.

2367
02:29:32,700 --> 02:29:33,580
No way.

2368
02:29:41,030 --> 02:29:41,910
Oh, man.

2369
02:29:43,750 --> 02:29:45,570
I think it was the blobfish.

2370
02:29:47,750 --> 02:29:48,850
Why not just Echidna?

2371
02:29:48,970 --> 02:29:50,870
Because it said the scientific name.

2372
02:29:52,890 --> 02:29:53,150
Oh.

2373
02:29:58,990 --> 02:30:00,310
Well, we tried the quiz.

2374
02:30:00,450 --> 02:30:01,130
We got the quiz.

2375
02:30:02,470 --> 02:30:03,130
So that's cool.

2376
02:30:03,230 --> 02:30:04,450
We at least got that part.

2377
02:30:04,750 --> 02:30:05,070
Glad.

2378
02:30:06,610 --> 02:30:07,330
No, you're not.

2379
02:30:07,350 --> 02:30:08,250
on the list.

2380
02:30:09,710 --> 02:30:10,010
Selene.

2381
02:30:11,270 --> 02:30:12,750
Selene, they're not on the list.

2382
02:30:17,150 --> 02:30:18,050
Wait a second.

2383
02:30:18,730 --> 02:30:19,150
Oh, never mind.

2384
02:30:21,710 --> 02:30:22,670
Oh, yeah, it's Eleanor.

2385
02:30:22,810 --> 02:30:23,310
Okay, yeah, yeah.

2386
02:30:24,290 --> 02:30:25,770
I think we got a not let her in.

2387
02:30:28,490 --> 02:30:30,390
I think we need a not let her in.

2388
02:30:34,450 --> 02:30:34,810
1980.

2389
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:40,860
The mole.

2390
02:30:41,360 --> 02:30:41,820
No, no, no.

2391
02:30:42,040 --> 02:30:42,360
They're twins.

2392
02:30:42,600 --> 02:30:42,920
They're twins.

2393
02:30:43,160 --> 02:30:43,400
They're twins.

2394
02:30:43,580 --> 02:30:44,600
They're two different people.

2395
02:30:45,320 --> 02:30:46,180
They're two different people.

2396
02:30:46,660 --> 02:30:49,120
You have Celine and the other and Illinois.

2397
02:30:49,740 --> 02:30:50,100
They're two.

2398
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:51,060
They're twins.

2399
02:30:55,220 --> 02:30:55,900
The nose.

2400
02:30:56,740 --> 02:30:58,100
The nose!

2401
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:00,200
You're so right.

2402
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:02,120
What's wrong with my appearance?

2403
02:31:03,500 --> 02:31:08,080
I mean, I think everything is fine with my appearance.

2404
02:31:14,060 --> 02:31:15,320
Hey, I'm Mint and Chat.

2405
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:16,920
What's your favorite ice cream flavor?

2406
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:18,800
Mine is chocolate chip mint ice cream.

2407
02:31:19,020 --> 02:31:20,160
So have a fantastic weekend.

2408
02:31:20,500 --> 02:31:22,240
Chocomito, ice, ice, ice.

2409
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:26,040
Uh, my favorite.

2410
02:31:27,580 --> 02:31:28,100
Hmm.

2411
02:31:29,560 --> 02:31:31,480
I think I really like...

2412
02:31:31,480 --> 02:31:34,820
It depends on if I'm in a fruity mood or a milky mood.

2413
02:31:35,360 --> 02:31:37,320
I really like Oreo ice cream.

2414
02:31:39,420 --> 02:31:40,480
Oreo's so good.

2415
02:31:41,740 --> 02:31:43,520
But I also like mint.

2416
02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:53,380
chocolate mint yeah it's so funny because a lot of people
draw me as like ice cream but that was never really my

2417
02:31:53,380 --> 02:32:03,040
intention because especially with like my you know original
look I was never so you know my name's mint and I wear a lot

2418
02:32:03,040 --> 02:32:11,080
of mint but I was never mint chocolate and then with this
outfit I only added a little bit of chocolate motifs but a

2419
02:32:11,080 --> 02:32:12,760
lot of people draw me as ice cream

2420
02:32:18,260 --> 02:32:21,580
What'd she say?

2421
02:32:21,740 --> 02:32:22,120
Oh, sorry.

2422
02:32:22,280 --> 02:32:23,040
I was not paying attention.

2423
02:32:23,180 --> 02:32:23,860
What'd you say, lady?

2424
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:27,640
I didn't...

2425
02:32:27,640 --> 02:32:27,980
What?

2426
02:32:28,040 --> 02:32:29,020
You said check it again?

2427
02:32:29,260 --> 02:32:29,540
Whatever.

2428
02:32:33,460 --> 02:32:35,220
I think we should not let her in.

2429
02:32:36,140 --> 02:32:41,640
Because, Mia Stone, you did not put your thing about being a
teacher.

2430
02:32:42,760 --> 02:32:43,920
Oh, emergency at work.

2431
02:32:47,300 --> 02:32:48,780
No stamp here!

2432
02:32:49,860 --> 02:32:51,420
Oh, no stamp here!

2433
02:32:51,980 --> 02:32:54,760
It's so confusing because I put the stamps here.

2434
02:32:55,740 --> 02:32:59,540
So, like, I instinctually think that the stamps are going to
be there.

2435
02:33:00,620 --> 02:33:01,600
You know what I mean?

2436
02:33:01,960 --> 02:33:04,800
Three, three, one, two.

2437
02:33:07,640 --> 02:33:10,220
Mint Oreo ice cream is next level TBH.

2438
02:33:11,220 --> 02:33:11,720
Oh.

2439
02:33:14,920 --> 02:33:15,960
Let's get...

2440
02:33:15,960 --> 02:33:18,780
They draw you as ice cream because you're so cool?

2441
02:33:18,840 --> 02:33:20,000
Ah, thanks.

2442
02:33:20,980 --> 02:33:22,700
Hey, Mint, Chris's wife here.

2443
02:33:22,960 --> 02:33:23,600
Have you seen him?

2444
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:24,700
He's running away.

2445
02:33:25,420 --> 02:33:27,760
No, I didn't let the doppelganger in.

2446
02:33:28,540 --> 02:33:28,680
What?

2447
02:33:29,400 --> 02:33:29,920
No!

2448
02:33:36,850 --> 02:33:38,730
Who was it?

2449
02:33:42,430 --> 02:33:44,110
Ah, just one.

2450
02:33:48,590 --> 02:33:49,230
Natcha!

2451
02:33:52,340 --> 02:33:54,240
You guys did say the nose.

2452
02:33:55,720 --> 02:33:57,780
You guys did say Natcha's nose.

2453
02:33:58,680 --> 02:34:01,100
You did say... That was so close.

2454
02:34:02,020 --> 02:34:04,320
That was so close.

2455
02:34:05,200 --> 02:34:07,700
Natcha, Natcha neighbor, for real.

2456
02:34:09,140 --> 02:34:10,200
But we did get an A.

2457
02:34:12,400 --> 02:34:12,660
Dang.

2458
02:34:13,480 --> 02:34:14,900
It was the nose.

2459
02:34:15,820 --> 02:34:26,280
I should have known Nosed because you guys are experts You
guys are nose experts apparently I really want to see

2460
02:34:26,280 --> 02:34:35,640

2465
02:35:18,380 --> 02:35:20,260
Thing was the blobfish.

2466
02:35:21,160 --> 02:35:23,080
I know, everybody's been saying that.

2467
02:35:23,660 --> 02:35:24,080
Oh, hello.

2468
02:35:24,920 --> 02:35:25,800
Good afternoon.

2469
02:35:27,760 --> 02:35:28,980
McCluey Red Boys.

2470
02:35:29,200 --> 02:35:30,100
He's always wearing his hat.

2471
02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:30,920
It said that.

2472
02:35:31,380 --> 02:35:32,260
The thing, we got a date.

2473
02:35:32,420 --> 02:35:33,300
We got a stamp.

2474
02:35:33,940 --> 02:35:35,000
Got some numbers.

2475
02:35:35,160 --> 02:35:36,520
Can't tell if they're right or wrong.

2476
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:37,580
We have no idea.

2477
02:35:38,440 --> 02:35:39,480
His nose seems right.

2478
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:40,360
His mustache seems right.

2479
02:35:40,540 --> 02:35:41,760
Everything seems correct.

2480
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:44,420
Doing some shopping.

2481
02:35:44,900 --> 02:35:47,000
He's retired, so that makes sense.

2482
02:35:48,540 --> 02:35:50,080
He's got the stamp.

2483
02:35:53,020 --> 02:35:54,700
Ask to remove his hat.

2484
02:35:54,900 --> 02:35:55,640
Can I do that?

2485
02:36:00,300 --> 02:36:02,240
Remove your hat, sir.

2486
02:36:06,900 --> 02:36:07,500
Okay.

2487
02:36:10,240 --> 02:36:10,920
I think he's good.

2488
02:36:20,950 --> 02:36:21,490
Mcloy.

2489
02:36:22,170 --> 02:36:22,490
Yeah.

2490
02:36:22,510 --> 02:36:23,470
Yeah, that's his name.

2491
02:36:24,390 --> 02:36:25,070
Hello, milk.

2492
02:36:26,610 --> 02:36:26,950
Man.

2493
02:36:28,870 --> 02:36:29,490
Your nose.

2494
02:36:31,590 --> 02:36:32,730
That is not your nose.

2495
02:36:33,670 --> 02:36:34,970
That is not the correct nose.

2496
02:36:36,230 --> 02:36:36,370
No.

2497
02:36:36,850 --> 02:36:37,230
No.

2498
02:36:38,510 --> 02:36:39,410
No, no, no, no, no.

2499
02:36:39,810 --> 02:36:40,930
That is not your nose.

2500
02:36:41,430 --> 02:36:42,310
That is not your nose.

2501
02:36:49,790 --> 02:36:51,110
That is not his nose.

2502
02:36:51,890 --> 02:36:52,210
I know.

2503
02:36:53,450 --> 02:36:54,430
It was not his nose.

2504
02:36:55,870 --> 02:36:57,510
His nose was not so defined.

2505
02:37:01,750 --> 02:37:02,690
I'm almost positive.

2506
02:37:04,290 --> 02:37:06,230
I'm like, check his file.

2507
02:37:06,350 --> 02:37:08,550
No, we're doing a run where we don't check the files.

2508
02:37:14,210 --> 02:37:15,690
That was not his nose.

2509
02:37:16,250 --> 02:37:18,010
I know it, I know it, I know it.

2510
02:37:20,690 --> 02:37:21,570
Um, hello?

2511
02:37:24,430 --> 02:37:26,190
Uh, entry request?

2512
02:37:27,210 --> 02:37:30,910
Uh, oh, uh, not on the list?

2513
02:37:31,390 --> 02:37:33,050
Due to an emergency?

2514
02:37:34,450 --> 02:37:35,910
What kind of emergency?

2515
02:37:36,410 --> 02:37:37,010
Selene?

2516
02:37:42,690 --> 02:37:43,430
Muddle.

2517
02:37:44,890 --> 02:37:46,090
But no, you said emergency.

2518
02:37:47,690 --> 02:37:48,270
The mole?

2519
02:37:48,470 --> 02:37:48,730
No, no.

2520
02:37:48,870 --> 02:37:49,370
That's the sister.

2521
02:37:49,530 --> 02:37:50,090
It's the sister.

2522
02:38:05,230 --> 02:38:05,770
Wee-woo!

2523
02:38:08,470 --> 02:38:13,970
Yeah, there's the sister Selene and the sister Ellen...

2524
02:38:13,970 --> 02:38:14,370
Something.

2525
02:38:14,890 --> 02:38:15,630
Ellen...

2526
02:38:16,730 --> 02:38:17,390
Illinois.

2527
02:38:20,710 --> 02:38:20,970
Illinois.

2528
02:38:21,550 --> 02:38:21,590
Illinois, yeah.

2529
02:38:22,710 --> 02:38:23,310
Illinois.

2530
02:38:25,150 --> 02:38:26,010
Okay, nice.

2531
02:38:26,290 --> 02:38:27,010
Good job, everybody.

2532
02:38:30,090 --> 02:38:31,270
Oh, hello.

2533
02:38:33,390 --> 02:38:34,650
Your ID, sir?

2534
02:38:35,510 --> 02:38:36,170
Hello.

2535
02:38:42,050 --> 02:38:44,370
Oh, he got back from his lobotomy.

2536
02:38:46,050 --> 02:38:47,110
That must be it.

2537
02:38:50,370 --> 02:38:50,850
XLR8.

2538
02:38:58,850 --> 02:38:59,810
You're not...

2539
02:38:59,810 --> 02:39:02,130
Oh, sir, you're not on today's list.

2540
02:39:02,870 --> 02:39:04,110
Am I not on today's list?

2541
02:39:05,530 --> 02:39:06,650
There must be a mistake.

2542
02:39:07,090 --> 02:39:07,850
I should be on the list.

2543
02:39:09,930 --> 02:39:11,250
Look at the list again.

2544
02:39:13,750 --> 02:39:14,710
Lobotomy, lobotomy.

2545
02:39:17,110 --> 02:39:17,890
My forehead?

2546
02:39:18,190 --> 02:39:18,570
Yeah.

2547
02:39:20,130 --> 02:39:20,850
It's nothing.

2548
02:39:21,390 --> 02:39:22,370
Just ignore it.

2549
02:39:36,210 --> 02:39:37,090
Doorbar...

2550
02:39:37,090 --> 02:39:39,070
I got that Suguru hair like...

2551
02:39:40,250 --> 02:39:40,910
Stop.

2552
02:39:42,330 --> 02:39:44,970
Learn a thing and talk to me.

2553
02:39:47,950 --> 02:39:48,610
Satoru.

2554
02:39:48,610 --> 02:39:51,070
When you listen, I was gone.

2555
02:39:51,350 --> 02:39:52,270
Wait, no, Gojo.

2556
02:39:55,190 --> 02:39:55,850
Satoru.

2557
02:39:56,810 --> 02:39:57,470
Hello!

2558
02:39:58,030 --> 02:39:59,570
You are always out.

2559
02:40:00,930 --> 02:40:01,850
Mr. Angus.

2560
02:40:02,610 --> 02:40:03,910
Oh, um, ID, please.

2561
02:40:08,990 --> 02:40:10,470
Don't make me sob.

2562
02:40:13,550 --> 02:40:14,210
1968.

2563
02:40:17,910 --> 02:40:21,510
Moustache appearance seems typical.

2564
02:40:24,090 --> 02:40:25,370
Uh, stamp.

2565
02:40:26,310 --> 02:40:29,530
Angus Ki-Priani.

2566
02:40:34,400 --> 02:40:35,180
Oh no.

2567
02:40:35,700 --> 02:40:36,380
I think we're good.

2568
02:40:39,580 --> 02:40:40,800
I think he's good.

2569
02:40:44,140 --> 02:40:45,140
The tie?

2570
02:40:45,320 --> 02:40:45,920
No, it's good.

2571
02:40:47,740 --> 02:40:48,720
No job.

2572
02:40:48,800 --> 02:40:50,620
I don't think they have to say it every time, do they?

2573
02:40:52,700 --> 02:40:56,300
I don't think they say it they have to say it every time

2574
02:40:59,630 --> 02:41:01,490
I think we're good

2575
02:41:04,950 --> 02:41:10,860
bye-bye next please

2576
02:41:14,840 --> 02:41:18,380
uh-oh uh-oh

2577
02:41:22,760 --> 02:41:38,160
uh-oh uh uh-oh

2578
02:41:42,880 --> 02:41:44,080
Uh-oh.

2579
02:41:51,460 --> 02:41:52,900
The apartment?

2580
02:41:53,060 --> 02:41:55,160
Oh my gosh, that's so sneaky.

2581
02:41:55,400 --> 02:41:56,280
Wait, no, it's correct.

2582
02:41:57,760 --> 02:41:58,960
It's correct.

2583
02:41:59,160 --> 02:41:59,280
Wait.

2584
02:42:00,120 --> 02:42:00,760
Oh, 30.

2585
02:42:01,240 --> 02:42:02,460
Oh, wow.

2586
02:42:02,720 --> 02:42:04,280
That's really sneaky.

2587
02:42:04,740 --> 02:42:08,620
Oh, that is so sneaky.

2588
02:42:15,420 --> 02:42:17,680
Sorry, number is really confused me.

2589
02:42:18,180 --> 02:42:18,580
Yeah.

2590
02:42:20,180 --> 02:42:21,340
You almost got God, girl.

2591
02:42:21,540 --> 02:42:22,100
I know.

2592
02:42:23,080 --> 02:42:27,000
Well, I would have reported him anyway because we already
let the other guy in.

2593
02:42:27,360 --> 02:42:31,620
So I would have sent him away anyway.

2594
02:42:32,620 --> 02:42:32,920
Thank you.

2595
02:42:33,820 --> 02:42:34,820
Thank you.

2596
02:42:35,180 --> 02:42:35,980
Thank you.

2597
02:42:36,320 --> 02:42:36,940
Thank you.

2598
02:42:37,660 --> 02:42:38,160
Next.

2599
02:42:39,500 --> 02:42:40,480
Get over here.

2600
02:42:40,700 --> 02:42:41,140
Next.

2601
02:42:41,300 --> 02:42:41,440
Oh.

2602
02:42:42,520 --> 02:42:43,440
Good afternoon.

2603
02:42:43,660 --> 02:42:44,200
Where's your ID?

2604
02:42:46,580 --> 02:42:48,520
Yeah, you did forget to show me your ID.

2605
02:42:50,180 --> 02:42:50,900
a stone.

2606
02:42:52,140 --> 02:42:53,600
Big mistake.

2607
02:42:56,920 --> 02:42:58,000
Okay, we got a date.

2608
02:42:58,940 --> 02:43:02,560
We've got a we've got a stamp.

2609
02:43:03,420 --> 02:43:04,660
We've got some names.

2610
02:43:06,420 --> 02:43:10,200
Now I have to worry about other things that I didn't even
think about having to check before.

2611
02:43:10,360 --> 02:43:11,100
She's a teacher.

2612
02:43:11,220 --> 02:43:11,760
Yes, she is.

2613
02:43:11,880 --> 02:43:12,660
We got a stamp.

2614
02:43:14,360 --> 02:43:15,240
Oh, 301.

2615
02:43:17,720 --> 02:43:22,180
I think I think I think she's good.

2616
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:28,000
Wait, we didn't let her in earlier, did we?

2617
02:43:29,940 --> 02:43:30,860
I don't think we did.

2618
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:32,740
I don't think we let her in earlier.

2619
02:43:32,920 --> 02:43:34,180
I think we'll...

2620
02:43:36,990 --> 02:43:37,650
I think we're good.

2621
02:43:38,690 --> 02:43:38,870
No?

2622
02:43:44,350 --> 02:43:44,630
Hold on.

2623
02:43:45,530 --> 02:43:46,250
Everything is...

2624
02:43:46,250 --> 02:43:48,210
I can't tell if it's my internet or why.

2625
02:43:48,430 --> 02:43:49,810
Everything's starting to stutter a little bit.

2626
02:43:50,150 --> 02:43:51,270
Alright, let's let her in.

2627
02:43:53,090 --> 02:43:53,730
Previous run.

2628
02:43:53,990 --> 02:43:55,290
The runs are really fusing together.

2629
02:43:56,130 --> 02:43:57,210
They are.

2630
02:43:58,050 --> 02:43:58,610
Rish.

2631
02:43:59,630 --> 02:44:00,190
Hello.

2632
02:44:01,190 --> 02:44:01,670
ID.

2633
02:44:04,410 --> 02:44:05,250
Yeah, this is...

2634
02:44:05,250 --> 02:44:07,530
It's like starting to lag a little bit.

2635
02:44:08,730 --> 02:44:08,730
Okay.

2636
02:44:09,450 --> 02:44:11,870
Gloria, this is our last run, so...

2637
02:44:11,870 --> 02:44:13,830
Oh my gosh, I thought that was a mole?

2638
02:44:14,730 --> 02:44:17,710
I was like, the mole's on the rock side!

2639
02:44:20,110 --> 02:44:21,970
No seams up to par.

2640
02:44:23,910 --> 02:44:24,470
Yes.

2641
02:44:26,930 --> 02:44:36,890
Date, stamp, date, 0201, 0201.

2642
02:44:38,710 --> 02:44:40,530
I think we have to let her in.

2643
02:44:40,890 --> 02:44:42,930
I think we have to let her in.

2644
02:44:43,110 --> 02:44:44,030
I thought so too.

2645
02:44:44,170 --> 02:44:44,730
I know, right?

2646
02:44:47,370 --> 02:44:47,930
Next!

2647
02:44:49,230 --> 02:44:50,830
Next, next, next!

2648
02:44:53,670 --> 02:44:54,230
Oh.

2649
02:44:54,630 --> 02:44:55,530
Oh my gosh.

2650
02:44:55,890 --> 02:44:56,970
you guys come in together?

2651
02:45:00,290 --> 02:45:00,890
Date.

2652
02:45:02,790 --> 02:45:04,110
Let's check your appearance.

2653
02:45:04,970 --> 02:45:06,390
You got your handlebar mustache.

2654
02:45:06,990 --> 02:45:07,690
Very good.

2655
02:45:08,150 --> 02:45:09,670
You got your little hat on.

2656
02:45:10,030 --> 02:45:10,910
Job is a rider.

2657
02:45:11,150 --> 02:45:12,390
Yes, that's correct as well.

2658
02:45:13,190 --> 02:45:14,970
I'm gonna have to let you in.

2659
02:45:17,550 --> 02:45:19,650
Hopefully I didn't oversee anything.

2660
02:45:20,250 --> 02:45:21,950
Hopefully I didn't miss something.

2661
02:45:22,630 --> 02:45:23,230
Next!

2662
02:45:24,390 --> 02:45:24,990

No mole.

2671
02:46:22,750 --> 02:46:24,130
Oh my god, it's the hidden sister.

2672
02:46:25,350 --> 02:46:25,910
It's her.

2673
02:46:25,910 --> 02:46:27,910
It's her solidus!

2674
02:46:32,710 --> 02:46:34,310
What's wrong with my appearance?

2675
02:46:36,690 --> 02:46:38,950
I think everything's fine with my appearance.

2676
02:46:40,890 --> 02:46:41,570
Think again.

2677
02:46:43,070 --> 02:46:44,370
Oh, do you even think?

2678
02:46:46,770 --> 02:46:48,330
Here's my entry request.

2679
02:46:48,490 --> 02:46:50,350
Wow, she forged it really well.

2680
02:46:51,790 --> 02:46:53,270
She's got the stamp and everything.

2681
02:46:57,090 --> 02:46:57,570
Yep.

2682
02:46:59,750 --> 02:47:02,510

2683
02:47:03,510 --> 02:47:06,590
Okay, Miss, Miss Eleanoy's.

02:47:11,130 --> 02:47:14,790
Yeah, little do we know she went, she's coming back from the
doctors.

2685
02:47:15,650 --> 02:47:17,970
She's just like, oh, I just had the worst day.

2686
02:47:18,530 --> 02:47:23,370
Like, getting this mole removed was so much more painful
than I imagined it to be.

2687
02:47:24,930 --> 02:47:32,070
I forgot to tell the entrance, but I'm sure they'll
recognize me they'll let me in it's no big deal and we send

2688
02:47:32,070 --> 02:47:47,610
her to jail or to die i don't know do they die or they good
afternoon where's your entry request thank you me yes didn't

2689
02:47:47,610 --> 02:47:49,550
we let me a stone in before already

2690
02:47:53,540 --> 02:47:54,900
uh oh this one wait

2691
02:48:01,570 --> 02:48:02,590
yes we did

2692
02:48:09,920 --> 02:48:11,280
the second wife

2693
02:48:14,300 --> 02:48:19,040
the second the second wife 1978

2694
02:48:25,490 --> 02:48:34,950
I hope it wasn't like the numbers were wrong they're like
the ID numbers because there's no way I'm a resident of the

2695
02:48:34,950 --> 02:48:43,210
building I come from my job as a teacher anyone could know
that anyone could know me as stone's a teacher You creepy

2696
02:48:43,210 --> 02:48:43,890
doppelganger.

2697
02:48:49,990 --> 02:48:51,630
I guess we'll just have to not let her in, I think.

2698
02:48:54,790 --> 02:48:56,370
Yeah, I think we just have to not let her in.

2699
02:49:06,740 --> 02:49:07,800
The last one had...

2700
02:49:07,800 --> 02:49:08,360
No logo?

2701
02:49:29,210 --> 02:49:29,850
No logo?

2702
02:49:36,150 --> 02:49:39,010
If that was the last one, I'm going to cry.

2703
02:49:44,600 --> 02:49:45,540
You bitch!

2704
02:49:47,680 --> 02:49:48,840
Get out of here!

2705
02:49:50,580 --> 02:49:52,600
Get out of here with your round face.

2706
02:49:52,740 --> 02:49:53,740
I don't want to see you.

2707
02:49:56,020 --> 02:49:57,680
I don't want to see you.

2708
02:50:08,840 --> 02:50:09,400
No!

2709
02:50:11,300 --> 02:50:13,900
I can't believe we messed up.

2710
02:50:16,560 --> 02:50:18,180
I should have...

2711
02:50:18,300 --> 02:50:20,040
I should have kept track.

2712
02:50:20,240 --> 02:50:23,300
I should have kept track of whether I...

2713
02:50:26,340 --> 02:50:28,020
Old man!

2714
02:50:32,760 --> 02:50:34,360
Oh, please.

2715
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:37,620
Oh, I don't even feel like...

2716
02:50:37,620 --> 02:50:41,460
I don't even feel the motivation anymore.

2717
02:50:46,350 --> 02:50:48,350
Rip run, yeah.

2718
02:50:55,400 --> 02:50:57,280
He seems fine.

2719
02:50:57,300 --> 02:50:58,760
It doesn't matter anyway.

2720
02:50:59,040 --> 02:50:59,580
Just let him in.

2721
02:51:02,040 --> 02:51:03,140
Just let him in.

2722
02:51:04,640 --> 02:51:05,860
How many people are left?

2723
02:51:08,200 --> 02:51:11,580
No, you always have your hat on!

2724
02:51:12,480 --> 02:51:12,880
Roman!

2725
02:51:16,440 --> 02:51:17,000
Wait.

2726
02:51:17,400 --> 02:51:18,740
I want to ask him about it.

2727
02:51:22,020 --> 02:51:23,480
Oh, my appearance.

2728
02:51:23,600 --> 02:51:24,680
Is it because of my hat?

2729
02:51:26,280 --> 02:51:27,200
I forgot it.

2730
02:51:27,300 --> 02:51:29,700
He didn't call my apartment and ask my wife.

2731
02:51:31,980 --> 02:51:33,380
Wait, I didn't expect that answer.

2732
02:51:34,520 --> 02:51:36,320
I thought he said he'd, like, lose it or something.

2733
02:51:37,400 --> 02:51:37,880
No way.

2734
02:51:38,780 --> 02:51:39,940
You left it at home?

2735
02:51:40,140 --> 02:51:42,360
That sounds like a reasonable answer.

2736
02:51:47,520 --> 02:51:48,820
This can happen?

2737
02:51:54,230 --> 02:51:55,510
He doesn't have a wife.

2738
02:51:55,610 --> 02:51:56,670
Oh, yes, he does.

2739
02:51:56,830 --> 02:51:58,450
And this is a lucky man.

2740
02:51:59,450 --> 02:52:00,730
Have you seen his wife?

2741
02:52:02,050 --> 02:52:02,930
Good golly.

2742
02:52:05,990 --> 02:52:07,270
She's got...

2743
02:52:07,270 --> 02:52:09,970
And she also has...

2744
02:52:11,130 --> 02:52:13,970
And a ton of...

2745
02:52:14,950 --> 02:52:15,450
Cool.

2746
02:52:16,370 --> 02:52:17,750
1.152.

2747
02:52:23,030 --> 02:52:23,910
Thank you guys.

2748
02:52:29,750 --> 02:52:31,470
Lois Dilsky is speaking.

2749
02:52:32,310 --> 02:52:33,690
My husband is not at home.

2750
02:52:34,210 --> 02:52:35,010
Did he forget his hat?

2751
02:52:35,930 --> 02:52:36,590
His hat?

2752
02:52:36,750 --> 02:52:37,410
Yes, yes, yes.

2753
02:52:38,390 --> 02:52:39,370
Yes, he is.

2754
02:52:39,390 --> 02:52:40,470
You left a year!

2755
02:52:43,340 --> 02:52:47,120
I almost... I almost sent you to die, Roman.

2756
02:52:49,080 --> 02:52:50,640
I almost sent you to die.

2757
02:52:51,620 --> 02:52:52,820
Have a good day.

2758
02:53:00,860 --> 02:53:01,920
How many are left?

2759
02:53:05,620 --> 02:53:06,660
Peach Man.

2760
02:53:09,140 --> 02:53:10,820
You, me of stone.

2761
02:53:11,040 --> 02:53:12,800
I'm never watching La La Land again.

2762
02:53:15,580 --> 02:53:17,640
I'm never watching La La Land again.

2763
02:53:17,700 --> 02:53:19,700
I'm a La La Land auntie now!

2764
02:53:24,800 --> 02:53:26,120
Oh yeah.

2765
02:53:28,670 --> 02:53:28,990
Oops.

2766
02:53:31,190 --> 02:53:33,170
Everything about the appearance seems fine.

2767
02:53:34,550 --> 02:53:36,130
I don't know why I'm still caring.

2768
02:53:36,330 --> 02:53:37,790
Maybe I'm hoping for a miracle.

2769
02:53:39,750 --> 02:53:41,590
Maybe I'm hoping for a miracle.

2770
02:53:43,130 --> 02:53:43,730
Something.

2771
02:53:45,190 --> 02:53:45,850
Going.

2772
02:53:48,990 --> 02:53:49,650
Going.

2773
02:54:05,720 --> 02:54:07,300
Oh no date.

2774
02:54:18,330 --> 02:54:20,070
He fell down the stairs.

2775
02:54:22,210 --> 02:54:24,070
He left something in his car, obviously.

2776
02:54:24,670 --> 02:54:26,230
He had to run out really fast.

2777
02:54:27,130 --> 02:54:27,860
Go grab it.

2778
02:54:39,370 --> 02:54:39,850
Wait,

2779
02:54:44,350 --> 02:54:46,750
so I also let a guy in?

2780
02:54:52,900 --> 02:54:54,000
Neighbors killed one.

2781
02:54:55,120 --> 02:54:56,440
Wait, who did I let in then?

2782
02:54:56,960 --> 02:54:57,300
Mia,

2783
02:55:04,720 --> 02:55:05,840
fake documents.

2784
02:55:08,420 --> 02:55:08,720
Mia.

2785
02:55:09,920 --> 02:55:12,440
Oh god, the game is like starting to lag so bad.

2786
02:55:12,820 --> 02:55:18,360
I think we let in fake Mia.

2787
02:55:36,580 --> 02:55:37,380
So frustrating.

2788
02:55:38,780 --> 02:55:39,040
It's harder.

2789
02:55:39,200 --> 02:55:41,240
It's, of course, harder when you can't see the records.

2790
02:55:41,500 --> 02:55:45,360
But I mean, honestly, we did a pretty good job for...

2791
02:55:45,360 --> 02:55:47,100
I think we just mixed up the Mia's.

2792
02:55:49,420 --> 02:55:50,920
I think we just mixed up the Mia's.

2793
02:55:51,320 --> 02:55:56,320
Well, we did a pretty good job for not having the records to
be able to reference to, so...

2794
02:55:57,420 --> 02:56:01,900
I think we killed... I think we killed the correct Mia.

2795
02:56:03,020 --> 02:56:06,940
And we... accidentally let in the bad Mia.

2796
02:56:08,360 --> 02:56:08,800
I think.

2797
02:56:16,900 --> 02:56:18,120
Mama Mia.

2798
02:56:23,310 --> 02:56:24,210
Well, that was fine.

2799
02:56:27,170 --> 02:56:35,790
Thank you guys for catching some ghastly ghouls with me
today.

2800
02:56:37,010 --> 02:56:37,190
Let's see.

2801
02:56:37,690 --> 02:56:39,640
What achievements do we have left still?

2802
02:56:44,880 --> 02:56:46,280
There's no A.

2803
02:56:46,480 --> 02:56:47,760
There's only S and F.

2804
02:56:49,920 --> 02:56:51,720
Oh yeah, Chester's quiz.

2805
02:56:53,520 --> 02:56:55,080
40 playthroughs.

2806
02:56:58,020 --> 02:57:02,220
Which we did not survive the past couple ones.

2807
02:57:02,420 --> 02:57:02,860
That's okay.

2808
02:57:03,520 --> 02:57:05,020
Toppleganger red-handed.

2809
02:57:06,640 --> 02:57:06,740
Uh.

2810
02:57:07,900 --> 02:57:08,740
Yeah, it's this one.

2811
02:57:08,980 --> 02:57:10,760
Survive without opening any folder.

2812
02:57:12,120 --> 02:57:12,260
Wait.

2813
02:57:13,640 --> 02:57:15,260
All we have to do is survive, right?

2814
02:57:16,300 --> 02:57:18,160
So we kill all of them.

2815
02:57:19,440 --> 02:57:21,020
Doesn't that technically mean...

2816
02:57:23,080 --> 02:57:23,820
Will survive?

2817
02:57:23,940 --> 02:57:25,280
I should have chosen a different username.

2818
02:57:25,380 --> 02:57:27,580
Every time you said, meh, this stream, I got jumpkin.

2819
02:57:28,920 --> 02:57:29,500
Sowie.

2820
02:57:34,450 --> 02:57:35,690
That works, it does.

2821
02:57:38,470 --> 02:57:40,450
We die if a doppel gets in.

2822
02:57:40,690 --> 02:57:45,010
Yeah, but if we just don't let anybody in, then it should be
fine.

2823
02:57:46,390 --> 02:57:46,670
Right?

2824
02:57:47,550 --> 02:57:48,410
You know what?

2825
02:57:48,530 --> 02:57:49,310
One more!

2826
02:57:49,430 --> 02:57:50,170
One more!

2827
02:57:50,750 --> 02:57:51,490
One more!

2828
02:57:51,670 --> 02:57:52,210
One more!

2829
02:57:53,510 --> 02:57:55,210
Let's try it.

2830
02:57:58,590 --> 02:58:00,010
Let's cheat the system.

2831
02:58:05,480 --> 02:58:06,380
Let's cheat the system.

2832
02:58:07,420 --> 02:58:09,540
This one should be fast because we're just killing
everybody.

2833
02:58:12,060 --> 02:58:13,440
Blood, blood, blood!

2834
02:58:14,400 --> 02:58:14,680
Yes!

2835
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:16,220
Death to you!

2836
02:58:18,740 --> 02:58:19,580
Oh, wait!

2837
02:58:20,920 --> 02:58:25,120
If we can catch a guy red-handed, that would also be another
thing, right?

2838
02:58:28,860 --> 02:58:30,360
No, you seem safe, though.

2839
02:58:43,680 --> 02:58:44,800
No survivors!

2840
02:58:48,100 --> 02:58:59,700
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill,
kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill,

2841
02:59:00,140 --> 02:59:16,580
kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, you
are on the list, um, see, that's his nose.

2842
02:59:17,200 --> 02:59:18,720
That's his nose, you guys.

2843
02:59:18,940 --> 02:59:21,400
The other nose had too much definition.

2844
02:59:21,600 --> 02:59:25,860
There was, like, little holes and stuff for him to breathe,
but he doesn't have those to breathe.

2845
02:59:26,020 --> 02:59:27,040
He's a mouth breather.

2846
02:59:38,800 --> 02:59:39,520
No logo?

2847
02:59:39,660 --> 02:59:40,160
It doesn't matter.

2848
02:59:40,340 --> 02:59:41,300
We're not going to let him in anyway.

2849
02:59:42,980 --> 02:59:44,720
We're not letting in a single person.

2850
02:59:48,140 --> 02:59:52,160
Is this the milkman that Tumblr is going wild for?

2851
02:59:53,080 --> 02:59:54,020
What do you mean by that?

2852
02:59:56,120 --> 02:59:57,560
Is Tumblr still a thing?

2853
03:00:00,340 --> 03:00:00,700
Good afternoon.

2854
03:00:02,500 --> 03:00:04,580
Doesn't this guy normally wear a hat anyway?

2855
03:00:08,420 --> 03:00:09,160
Is it because of my hat?

2856
03:00:09,280 --> 03:00:10,240
Yes, actually.

2857
03:00:14,180 --> 03:00:14,280
Oh.

2858
03:00:16,300 --> 03:00:17,760
I'm not gonna do that.

2859
03:00:33,930 --> 03:00:35,790
It's okay, he lived a long life.

2860
03:00:41,510 --> 03:00:43,890
People are simping for the milkman.

2861
03:00:46,190 --> 03:00:47,330
No way.

2862
03:00:47,910 --> 03:00:48,670
Wait, actually?

2863
03:00:50,210 --> 03:00:50,490
Oh.

2864
03:00:51,570 --> 03:00:53,630
Her eye is going the wrong way.

2865
03:00:56,930 --> 03:00:58,670
She's also not on the list.

2866
03:01:02,470 --> 03:01:04,150
What's wrong with my appearance?

2867
03:01:06,050 --> 03:01:09,590
Look carefully at the photos of my papers and compare them
with Well, with me.

2868
03:01:10,870 --> 03:01:11,950
No, I want you to get angry.

2869
03:01:12,570 --> 03:01:13,190
Get mad!

2870
03:01:16,850 --> 03:01:17,730
Get mad!

2871
03:01:20,150 --> 03:01:20,590
Okay.

2872
03:01:21,210 --> 03:01:21,830
You're boring.

2873
03:01:22,190 --> 03:01:22,630
Get out of here.

2874
03:01:28,940 --> 03:01:29,660
What'd you say?

2875
03:01:30,980 --> 03:01:33,180
Maybe I clicked the button before she finished talking.

2876
03:01:36,660 --> 03:01:37,860
Kind of spooked me, though.

2877
03:01:38,960 --> 03:01:41,120
Kind of scared me when I...

2878
03:01:41,600 --> 03:01:43,260
and she's like, look at the list again.

2879
03:01:43,860 --> 03:01:46,040
A lot of lewd fan art of him on Twitter!

2880
03:01:49,620 --> 03:01:50,840
That's crazy.

2881
03:01:54,280 --> 03:01:55,560
That's actually great.

2882
03:01:55,720 --> 03:01:55,880
Wait.

2883
03:01:56,620 --> 03:02:01,780
Is he on the sexy Tumblr man Tumblr website?

2884
03:02:05,740 --> 03:02:07,060

Good afternoon, Mr. Schmidt.

You have no stamp!

2888
03:02:17,080 --> 03:02:18,360
What's up with that?

2889
03:02:19,060 --> 03:02:19,240
Oh.

2890
03:02:24,390 --> 03:02:26,210
I am ruthless today.

2891
03:02:28,790 --> 03:02:32,630
Yes, but it's usually the other eye that is deviated.

2892
03:02:33,310 --> 03:02:33,550
Yeah.

2893
03:02:34,010 --> 03:02:34,970
No, I already said that.

2894
03:02:35,270 --> 03:02:37,150
As soon as she walked up, I recognized that.

2895
03:02:38,910 --> 03:02:39,950
I knew that already.

2896
03:02:40,490 --> 03:02:42,010
You guys are too slow.

2897
03:02:44,370 --> 03:02:50,290

2908
03:03:54,820 --> 03:03:55,820

What is the scientific name of the object?

2922
03:05:08,100 --> 03:05:11,820
Australian animal that drastically changes its appearance
when removed from its natural habitat.

2923
03:05:12,120 --> 03:05:14,140
Why did Google tell me the echidna?

2924

What is the name of the only sport that allows you to punch

2931
03:05:53,940 --> 03:05:54,540
Rugby?

2933
03:06:00,960 --> 03:06:01,240

2934
03:06:01,460 --> 03:06:02,000
That's a thing?

2935
03:06:08,080 --> 03:06:09,280
That's correct!

2936
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:18,280
At least how many times do you have to fold a 0.01
millimeter thick sheet of paper to cover the distance

2937
03:06:18,280 --> 03:06:18,740
between...

2938
03:06:19,400 --> 03:06:21,460
The Shire and Mordor.

2939
03:06:29,340 --> 03:06:29,860
38?

2940
03:06:30,460 --> 03:06:30,980
What?

2941
03:06:31,420 --> 03:06:32,640
What does that even mean?

2942
03:06:32,820 --> 03:06:40,340
Wait, how many times do you have to fold a 0.01 millimeter
thick sheet of paper to cover the distance between the Shire

2943
03:06:40,340 --> 03:06:41,020
and Mordor?

2944
03:06:41,580 --> 03:06:42,380
What does that mean?

2945
03:06:42,900 --> 03:06:45,300
You have to fold it 38 times to...

2946
03:06:45,300 --> 03:06:45,580
Huh?

2947
03:06:51,160 --> 03:06:54,320
How many pages between mentions of the two, I guess?

2948
03:06:54,940 --> 03:06:56,280
Yeah, I don't really understand.

2949
03:06:56,620 --> 03:06:58,200
Every fold doubles the thickness.

2950
03:07:01,060 --> 03:07:02,100
Yeah, but...

2951
03:07:02,100 --> 03:07:04,020
Okay, okay, I think I get it.

2952
03:07:04,300 --> 03:07:05,600
It's just not possible, though.

2953
03:07:06,620 --> 03:07:07,300
That's correct!

2954
03:07:07,980 --> 03:07:08,660
Good job, Google.

2955
03:07:09,500 --> 03:07:11,860
The key is...

2956
03:07:14,520 --> 03:07:15,040
Hide...

2957
03:07:15,040 --> 03:07:15,520
Wait, what?

2958
03:07:16,220 --> 03:07:18,300
Oh, I screenshot it because I thought it was...

2959
03:07:18,300 --> 03:07:18,460
Wait.

2960
03:07:20,800 --> 03:07:21,320

What does it mean, though?

2963
03:07:31,240 --> 03:07:32,400
What does the cipher mean?

2964
03:07:34,040 --> 03:07:36,800
I like how you guys are just looking this up and spoon
feeding it to me.

2965
03:07:37,380 --> 03:07:37,740
Thank you.

2966
03:07:40,580 --> 03:07:41,400
Thank you.

2967
03:07:43,240 --> 03:07:44,960
We're so smart today, guys.

2968
03:07:48,740 --> 03:07:49,700
That's correct.

2969
03:07:50,140 --> 03:07:50,880
Who would have thought?

2970
03:07:53,640 --> 03:07:55,100
How long is this quiz?

2971
03:07:56,060 --> 03:08:02,700
According to FSM Global Warming, Is a consequence of the
fact that since the 19th century, the number of blank

2972
03:08:02,700 --> 03:08:03,340
decrease.

2973
03:08:07,400 --> 03:08:07,980
Pirates.

2974
03:08:10,340 --> 03:08:10,920
Pirates?

2975
03:08:17,920 --> 03:08:18,500
Really?

2976
03:08:19,800 --> 03:08:20,940
That's correct.

2977
03:08:23,200 --> 03:08:24,960
You managed to answer all my questions correctly.

2978
03:08:25,540 --> 03:08:27,260
Congratulations, you have earned my badge.

2979
03:08:28,700 --> 03:08:29,000
Ah!

2980
03:08:34,440 --> 03:08:35,300
Thank you.

2981
03:08:38,400 --> 03:08:38,920
Uh...

2982
03:08:38,920 --> 03:08:38,980
Oh!

2983
03:08:39,880 --> 03:08:40,260
Goodbye!

2984
03:08:53,280 --> 03:08:53,760
MVP!

2985
03:08:54,240 --> 03:08:56,600
Except for when I- when it's for me!

2986
03:08:57,440 --> 03:08:59,680
Because I googled it and it said Echidna.

2987
03:08:59,880 --> 03:09:01,340
Why did it say Echidna?

2988
03:09:02,640 --> 03:09:03,160
Why?

2989
03:09:03,220 --> 03:09:04,580
That does not make any sense.

2990
03:09:05,660 --> 03:09:09,080
I thought there was maybe something about the Echidna that I
just didn't know.

2991
03:09:10,980 --> 03:09:11,920
I don't know.

2992
03:09:12,720 --> 03:09:14,560
Unless it was Chat GPT.

2993
03:09:15,640 --> 03:09:16,600
Who knows?

2994
03:09:18,980 --> 03:09:20,560
Bob Berger's looking ass.

2995
03:09:20,640 --> 03:09:20,900
Stop!

2996
03:09:26,200 --> 03:09:30,240
I think he's fine, but we're just gonna call please let you
know.

2997
03:09:33,180 --> 03:09:36,620
If I touch this thing, will I get diseased?

2998
03:09:38,060 --> 03:09:43,960
We'll figure, we'll find out after, if I touch this little
thing he gave me, that's a certified hot dog moment, can I

2999
03:09:43,960 --> 03:09:44,540
get a hot dog?

3000
03:09:50,480 --> 03:09:51,950
Thank you.

3001
03:09:54,700 --> 03:09:56,380

Bye-bye.

3004
03:10:03,480 --> 03:10:04,460

03:11:58,460 --> 03:11:59,300
Oh, sniffer.

3029
03:12:03,380 --> 03:12:05,000
Very natural, very human.

3030
03:12:05,580 --> 03:12:07,600
Actually, those kind of looked like my hands, didn't they?

3031
03:12:10,320 --> 03:12:12,300
They kind of looked like...

3032
03:12:12,300 --> 03:12:14,080
They kind of looked like my hands.

3033
03:12:14,520 --> 03:12:15,720
When they're up, you know?

3034
03:12:18,660 --> 03:12:19,500
Good afternoon.

3035
03:12:43,450 --> 03:12:45,990
Do I have to let you think like one person in?

3036
03:12:46,190 --> 03:12:48,670
Oh my god, my nose is so itchy.

3037
03:12:53,450 --> 03:12:54,850

Actually, here, let's let's actually move over to here.

3103
03:19:02,830 --> 03:19:06,950
I'm gonna exit out of the game so we don't get this creepy
music anymore.

3104
03:19:10,090 --> 03:19:10,730
Um...

3105
03:19:10,730 --> 03:19:12,790
Put on some music.

Some music.

03:19:33,040 --> 03:19:34,500
There we go.

3108

Then you send me...

3110
03:19:41,880 --> 03:19:46,300
Then you call the police on me and I get flushed down the
toilet.

3111
03:19:51,330 --> 03:19:52,940
Okay, let me try one other one.

3112
03:19:53,610 --> 03:19:53,650
Oh.

3113
03:19:54,810 --> 03:19:56,100

3115
03:19:58,350 --> 03:19:58,610

Uh.

3123
03:20:14,030 --> 03:20:15,370
That one was too easy.

3124
03:20:17,790 --> 03:20:18,410
Oh.

3125
03:20:19,010 --> 03:20:22,450
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this one, this one.

3127
03:20:24,210 --> 03:20:25,130
You'll never know.

3128
03:20:25,350 --> 03:20:26,570
You'll never know.

3129
03:20:30,810 --> 03:20:31,570
Okay, ready?

3130
03:20:52,850 --> 03:20:53,150
Huh?

3131
03:20:54,530 --> 03:20:55,010
Unchanged.

3132
03:20:55,210 --> 03:20:55,890
This is normal.

3133
03:20:57,350 --> 03:20:58,450
That's what I'm saying.

3134
03:21:00,730 --> 03:21:01,250
All right?

3135
03:21:01,570 --> 03:21:02,270
You don't know.

3136
03:21:04,130 --> 03:21:05,170
You don't know.

3137
03:21:10,020 --> 03:21:11,480
Okay, I'm going to give you another one.

It's itchy.

3143
03:22:02,510 --> 03:22:03,330
Why is it so wiggly?

3144
03:22:08,130 --> 03:22:10,050
There we go.

3145
03:22:13,310 --> 03:22:15,030
What do I make it bigger?

3146
03:22:16,250 --> 03:22:20,470
Like this.

3147
03:22:23,430 --> 03:22:24,490
This is peak.

3148
03:22:25,350 --> 03:22:28,730
This is what every man should strive to be.

3149
03:22:29,710 --> 03:22:35,990
This is peak masculinity.

3150
03:22:38,310 --> 03:22:39,670

Oh, no, a monocle.

3155
03:22:54,550 --> 03:22:57,750
There's so many things here that are fun to use.

3156
03:22:58,750 --> 03:23:00,610
Like, let's see what else we got in here.

03:23:21,250 --> 03:23:21,730
Yummy!

3165
03:23:22,890 --> 03:23:23,190
Wait.

3166
03:23:24,330 --> 03:23:25,610
It can hold it in my hands.

3167
03:23:26,730 --> 03:23:26,790
Right?

3168
03:23:29,670 --> 03:23:30,150
Whoa!

3169
03:23:36,500 --> 03:23:39,820

We have the technology.

3174
03:23:55,030 --> 03:23:56,150
Wow, this is so cool.

3175
03:23:56,830 --> 03:23:57,290
What does it say?

3176
03:23:57,350 --> 03:23:58,830
Boba, tea, coffee?

3177
03:24:06,640 --> 03:24:09,780

03:24:10,040 --> 03:24:11,240

3179
03:24:13,380 --> 03:24:15,200

Yeah!

3181
03:24:16,780 --> 03:24:17,920

Yippee!

3183
03:24:26,320 --> 03:24:27,800
It's kind of drippy though.

3184
03:24:27,900 --> 03:24:29,020
It's getting my sleeves wet.

3185
03:24:30,580 --> 03:24:31,520
Can we have a sippy too?

3186
03:24:33,340 --> 03:24:34,120
Drink up.

3187
03:24:36,080 --> 03:24:37,360
Here, I'll put it in the sand.

3188
03:24:38,820 --> 03:24:39,160
Okay.

3189
03:24:39,620 --> 03:24:40,840

I am trying what else is there let's see

3193
03:25:25,580 --> 03:25:27,020
There's also these.

3194
03:25:27,740 --> 03:25:29,220
Well, these look good on me, though, I wonder.

3195
03:25:30,600 --> 03:25:31,440
Okay, I'm going to try.

3196
03:25:32,920 --> 03:25:33,160
Wait.

3197
03:25:34,500 --> 03:25:35,460
I'm going to disappear.

3198
03:25:38,200 --> 03:25:40,320
Wait, I'm confused, actually.

3199
03:25:43,280 --> 03:25:44,320
Wait, hold on.

This

3207
03:26:27,430 --> 03:26:30,590
one's kind of, well, maybe it was just the angle.

3208
03:26:37,100 --> 03:26:38,020
What do you think?

3209
03:26:39,880 --> 03:26:41,340
So it would have been perfect for Easter.

3210
03:26:42,300 --> 03:26:42,480
Too bad.

3211
03:26:42,980 --> 03:26:45,860
Too bad we announced everything the day after.

3212
03:26:53,420 --> 03:26:53,820
Bunny.

3213
03:26:57,720 --> 03:26:58,520
Bunny, bunny.

3214
03:27:04,960 --> 03:27:10,080
You probably won't have to worry about this, but it could be
an idea of how placeholder emotes while looking for someone

3215
03:27:10,080 --> 03:27:10,460
to commission.

3216
03:27:10,620 --> 03:27:13,120
But I think you'll have plenty of members for months not
worry about it.

3217
03:27:13,160 --> 03:27:13,680
Oh, that's a good idea.

3218
03:27:13,700 --> 03:27:21,860
idea that's a good point though because yeah oh you're right
i might lose them i might lose them it's a lot of fun thank

3219
03:27:21,860 --> 03:27:34,240
you man thank you thank you for the don't know thank you i
like how when i blink they move that's so fancy the

3220
03:27:34,240 --> 03:27:41,880
technology the technology is real and they also like flop
back and forth

3221
03:27:45,160 --> 03:27:46,040
Yay!

3222
03:27:50,000 --> 03:27:50,560
Too cute.

3223
03:27:52,080 --> 03:27:53,160
So cute.

3224
03:27:57,740 --> 03:28:09,720
Yeah, I'll probably find a couple artists that can do some
stuff so that I'm not stressing one artist out with 37.

3225
03:28:10,600 --> 03:28:12,340
37 slots.

3226
03:28:13,700 --> 03:28:14,580
However many it was.

3227
03:28:15,740 --> 03:28:17,140
It was 37, wasn't it?

3228
03:28:17,340 --> 03:28:19,220
Or did I just see that in chat and believed it?

3229
03:28:21,060 --> 03:28:22,440
37 copies of Bustin.

3230
03:28:24,700 --> 03:28:25,040
Yes.

3231
03:28:27,020 --> 03:28:28,000

I want her to be as uncomfortable as possible all the time.

3259

Oh, we can do Bustin.

3278
03:32:24,600 --> 03:32:25,720
Actually, it's so funny.

3279
03:32:26,700 --> 03:32:29,180
Yesterday, I watched a trailer of an anime.

3280
03:32:29,860 --> 03:32:30,940
And I got bonked.

3281
03:32:31,200 --> 03:32:33,080
Like, so the stream got demonetized.

3282
03:32:34,940 --> 03:32:37,160
The stream got demonetized.

3283
03:32:37,340 --> 03:32:42,480
Because they were like, um, you showed the trailer and
you...

3284
03:32:42,560 --> 03:32:43,780
Also watched it.

3285
03:32:44,140 --> 03:32:48,920
So I have to be careful about that kind of stuff, I suppose.

3286
03:32:50,840 --> 03:32:51,220
Yeah.

3287
03:32:51,860 --> 03:32:52,680
It's okay, though.

3288
03:32:54,180 --> 03:32:57,580
I'm not, like, gonna cry about it.

3289
03:33:04,680 --> 03:33:10,940
But I want to make sure that things aren't so loud so that
they don't get caught so easily, you know?

3290
03:33:11,380 --> 03:33:13,000
Yeah, the Maid Wars one.

3291
03:33:13,220 --> 03:33:14,620
