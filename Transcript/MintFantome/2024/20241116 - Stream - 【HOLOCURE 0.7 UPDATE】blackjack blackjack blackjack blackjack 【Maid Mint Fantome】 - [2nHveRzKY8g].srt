1
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,300
There we are.

2
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,070
Did you even notice I was gone?

3
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,750
Did you even know...

4
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,010
I

5
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,100
was gone?

6
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,900
But I didn't stream for a week!

7
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,000
Did you even notice?

8
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,890
Did you even notice?

9
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,280
Did you...

10
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,500
Did you...

11
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,680
Did you...

12
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,780
Did you...

13
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,780
Find someone else to replace me?

14
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,660
No...

15
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,900
Maybe...

16
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,750
You left?

17
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,230
Yeah!

18
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,350
I'm sorry.

19
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:36,570
Yeah!

20
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,120
She's forgotten.

21
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,580
No!

22
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,580
Do you even know who I am?

23
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,580
Do you remember my name?

24
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:06,830
No!

25
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,350
Domenki?

26
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,170
Domenki?

27
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,480
We found Doki.

28
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,240
We set her marriage at bites!

29
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,420
Back up, sorry.

30
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,300
Wait, why are my arms down?

31
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,220
There we go.

32
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,480
Anyway, I know I gotta be big.

33
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,700
I'm not backing up.

34
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,680
And I'm not backing down!

35
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,450
Who is this girl?

36
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,730
Who is this?

37
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,840
Welcome back, maid channel.

38
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,400
Hey girl, it's your birthday!

39
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,340
Wait, hold on.

40
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,200
I didn't set my stuff up.

41
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,180
Domenki.

42
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,140
Happy birthday to you!

43
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,360
Happy birthday to you!

44
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,840
Happy birthday, dear A.

45
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,400
Grom!

46
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,740
Happy birthday to you!

47
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:43,860
Who

48
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,470
is this?

49
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,670
Say my name.

50
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,060
Minky!

51
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,160
Minky!

52
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,420
I can't feel it.

53
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,060
Can't believe Doobi is gonna be at the concert.

54
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:17,840
Yeah!

55
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,140
I'm gonna be so hyped!

56
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
Thanks for the aqua soup.

57
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,940
My favorite zombie butler, Grom.

58
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,280
Minky!

59
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,680
Minky!

60
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,300
I'm so obsessed with the Minky.

61
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,440
I'm gonna turn it down just a little bit.

62
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,900
I can't hear myself think.

63
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,660
I'm scared to do a backflip.

64
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,220
Do a flip!

65
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,710
Minto's cheeks are ponypony.

66
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,610
Minto, will you marry me?

67
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,070
Play.

68
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:19,290
I don't trust any requests now.

69
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,470
I have...

70
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,330
I have...

71
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,910
They're all just out of pity.

72
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,410
They're just out of pity now.

73
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,400
It's okay.

74
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,700
It's okay.

75
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,920
I...

76
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,340
I have accepted my fate.

77
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,870
I have...

78
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,170
I have accept...

79
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,870
I have accepted my fate.

80
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,630
Pity marriage is cool though.

81
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,890
It is.

82
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,160
Will you marry me and also panel with me?

83
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,220
Yeah, let's do the panel together, Ashes.

84
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,020
If you're just like, oh my gosh...

85
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,820
I'm a fleshy.

86
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
Well then, just get a VTuber involved.

87
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,560
I'll help you.

88
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,280
Wait, it's another birthday?

89
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,780
It was my birthday yesterday.

90
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,580
Fuck's sake!

91
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,560
I'm at hag age.

92
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,860
Happy birthday!

93
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,420
Happy old.

94
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,680
You're old.

95
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,580
Happy birthday to you.

96
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,980
Happy birthday to you.

97
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,980
Happy birthday for fuck's sake.

98
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,760
Your name is funny.

99
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,100
Happy birthday to you.

100
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,290
I'm divorced.

101
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,150
It's not cool.

102
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,950
Wait, you and Nani got married?

103
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,060
Real?

104
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,520
I can't tell.

105
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,660
I can't tell.

106
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,320
I don't...

107
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,780
There are so many...

108
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,880
I don't know what's ever going on.

109
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,020
I'm married.

110
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,280
But you can come on a date with my wife.

111
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,100
What day do you want to go to Disneyland?

112
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,760
No, I want to go...

113
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:21,500
I was in California this past week.

114
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,200
And I took a shuttle to my hotel.

115
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,120
And the driver was talking to me.

116
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,120
I was like, what's good to go around here?

117
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,700
And he was like, don't go to Disney.

118
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,180
It's overrated.

119
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,800
And Knott's Berry Farm?

120
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,000
Overrated.

121
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,540
There was like a mountain place.

122
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know...

123
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,840
Either of them.

124
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,840
Magic Mountain?

125
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Magic Mountain.

126
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,480
What's good?

127
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,700
Oh, it's Six Flags.

128
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,340
Wait, so that means it probably has better roller coasters, right?

129
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,300
Also, Andreyko, thanks for the party.

130
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,620
Thank you.

131
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,240
Magic Mountain.

132
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,240
It has really good coasters.

133
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,780
That's what I like.

134
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,620
Oh my gosh, I saw today that...

135
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,760
That...

136
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,080
One of the Six Flags.

137
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,220
The one that has King Daka.

138
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,280
I can't remember the name of the Six Flags.

139
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,600
But they're getting rid of King Daka!

140
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,900
I'm so sad.

141
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,820
I'm so sad.

142
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,560
If you don't know King Daka, it's like...

143
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,360
I think it's the tallest roller coaster in the world.

144
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,760
Is it still the tallest?

145
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
Don't remember.

146
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,730
You look so damn cute.

147
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,290
Thank you.

148
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,650
It's my birthday tomorrow.

149
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,930
I am streaming tomorrow.

150
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,790
But I can sing it.

151
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,510
I can sing it.

152
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,310
Happy birthday to you.

153
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,870
Happy birthday to you.

154
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,510
Happy birthday, Arsloat.

155
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:44,310
Like Arscloat, but Arsloat.

156
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,250
Happy birthday, Sloth.

157
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,130
Oh, Sloth.

158
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:57,270
Happy birthday, dear Sloth.

159
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,970
Happy birthday to you.

160
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,350
As someone that works at Six Flags with King Daka...

161
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,750
No, it is not.

162
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,830
Wait, they're not getting rid of it?

163
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,190
So the article was a lie?

164
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,350
Someone spreading lies on the internet?

165
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,580
Am I always facing sideways?

166
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,780
No, it's just because I'm reading chat.

167
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,880
I can look this way too.

168
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,020
Or I can look forward.

169
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,900
But I'm reading chat.

170
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,880
You guys are there.

171
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,120
I got cool stuff to share.

172
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:44,440
Oh!

173
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,080
Ace Combat 7, there's ace enemy nicknamed Jester.

174
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,180
Real name is Dice Insider, which you encounter on normal difficulty.

175
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,380
It is a reference to the first Top Gun movie.

176
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,100
Who's that?

177
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,480
Dice and the first Insider?

178
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,460
Who's in the...

179
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,220
Who in the first Top Gun?

180
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,200
Oh my gosh.

181
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
You guys have been thinking...

182
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,200
I've been thinking...

183
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,200
I want to do a...

184
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,420
Probably a members watch along.

185
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,180
But I want to do a...

186
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:25,280
I want to do a marathon of the first three Indiana Joneses.

187
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,760
I watched Indiana Jones again on the plane on the way home.

188
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,560
And I'm just like...

189
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,200
I keep watching the Temple of Doom over and over again.

190
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,940
I want to watch the other ones too.

191
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,050
I haven't seen it in years.

192
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,450
I want to do it.

193
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,990
I want to watch them.

194
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,010
There are only three Indiana Joneses.

195
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,510
Never seen two or three.

196
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:04,970
Maybe.

197
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,930
It's to prepare for the game.

198
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,150
Oh, is it to prepare?

199
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:11,290
Maybe.

200
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,670
When does the game come out?

201
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,110
Hold on.

202
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,510
Indiana Jones game.

203
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,040
Oh, I can pre-purchase it.

204
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,120
Wait, when does it come out?

205
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,200
December 9th!

206
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:32,620
Wait.

207
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:35,700
Soon.

208
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,380
Soon.

209
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,220
Oh my god.

210
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,420
Oh my god!

211
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,410
I just finished watching the honeymoon stream.

212
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,790
I hope your cinnamon roll pants are okay.

213
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,360
It's okay.

214
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,580
It's okay.

215
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,900
Yeah, they're still stained.

216
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,840
I was so frustrated.

217
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,980
It's like...

218
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,740
I was just trying to work.

219
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,260
But I couldn't work, because everything was against me.

220
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,130
Shursti?

221
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:26,750
It's your birthday.

222
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,670
How many people's birthdays is it today?

223
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,130
Sang for me.

224
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,990
Can I request the MGS5 version?

225
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:33,290
Yeah.

226
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,390
Happy birthday.

227
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,470
Congratulations.

228
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,830
Happy birthday with salutations.

229
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,110
Happy birthday.

230
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:50,910
May your skies stay blue, Shursti.

231
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,770
Happy birthday to you.

232
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,050
Happy birthday everybody!

233
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,010
Today...

234
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,730
We're playing...

235
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,510
Halo Cure!

236
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,790
Look at the new menu!

237
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,630
New menu!

238
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,410
New menu!

239
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:22,910
Look!

240
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,330
I'm adjusting stuff on my computer.

241
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:26,690
There we go.

242
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,490
Are you Yomu from Toho's Kaizen?

243
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,770
Are you ready for... Dang it.

244
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:47,470
I'm ready.

245
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:47,530
Ready.

246
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,230
I'm ready for anything.

247
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:57,390
I like how it's 0.7.1731710129.

248
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,630
Feels like I just docked somebody.

249
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,190
But...

250
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,730
Yeah!

251
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,930
A cast to join.

252
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:14,950
What?

253
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,740
I'm one of the few, if not the only Wisp that was not attracted to Fem Nani.

254
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,560
I should ban that phrase in my chat.

255
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,820
I should...

256
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,980
I'm sick of it!

257
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,960
Don't become addicted to the minigames.

258
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,080
I don't know much about what's all in here.

259
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,380
I've tried to avoid everything.

260
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,540
So I'm excited...

261
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,860
...to see everything!

262
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,480
What do we start with?

263
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,740
Oh my gosh, I don't even know.

264
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,960
Do we start with...

265
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,480
Oh!

266
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,440
New everything!

267
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,340
Oh my gosh.

268
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,640
Wait, are there new upgrades and stuff?

269
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,260
Oh wait.

270
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,130
Oh my gosh, there's all new stuff!

271
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,230
Oh my gosh, there's all new stuff!

272
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,150
New look.

273
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:27,490
Okay, well all my stats are maxed out.

274
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,230
So...

275
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:29,950
Fan letters.

276
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,770
Unlocks fan letters.

277
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,870
All fan types can drop fan letters which grant permanent boosts.

278
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,130
And yeah, you can hold items now.

279
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,490
Let's see.

280
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,610
Oh, this is the eliminate.

281
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,250
This is the hold.

282
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,010
Allows weapons and items to be disabled in the armory.

283
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,080
Armory?

284
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,280
Hold?

285
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,620
Unlocks support items, allowing the use of support abilities chosen before a stage.

286
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,980
Fans have a chance to drop hollow house materials.

287
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,980
That's so big!

288
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,500
Hold!

289
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,800
Hold!

290
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,060
373k gold, Binto Rich.

291
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,320
I've been fishing a lot.

292
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,680
I've been fishing a lot.

293
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:19,720
Hold on.

294
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,480
Oh, this is the armory.

295
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,260
Yeah.

296
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,820
I still have more stuff to find.

297
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,540
My best combo is like 98 or something.

298
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,000
I don't know.

299
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,220
I remember I got close to...

300
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,360
I got close to 100.

301
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,280
A whole new line.

302
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,700
Hold on, I always choose a Kiwawa.

303
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,650
I can't tell if the music is different or not.

304
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:03,710
I always turn it off because I play while I do other things, you know?

305
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,610
Look at my little workers.

306
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,270
They're working hard.

307
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,550
They better not be tired, I swear.

308
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,750
Give me my money.

309
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,130
Thank you, workers.

310
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,350
It's the same?

311
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:19,930
Oh, okay.

312
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,350
Simponi.

313
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,690
Thanks for the five gufton.

314
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,130
I think they're all exhausted.

315
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,900
Oh god, I have 30 onions.

316
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,080
I was about to be like, uh-oh.

317
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,290
More onion!

318
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,450
This guy is a newbie.

319
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:54,930
Yeah, I have a bunch.

320
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:55,310
Okay.

321
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,350
Oh, you're also tired.

322
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:58,650
Okay.

323
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:00,770
More onion!

324
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,070
Yeah.

325
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,730
You can get more workers?

326
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,230
Yeah, but I'm stingy.

327
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,990
I don't want to spend my money on food.

328
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,170
I don't...

329
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,670
I'm stingy and I don't want to keep planting.

330
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,770
Why isn't this area expanded?

331
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:21,930
Smash boo!

332
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,050
Thanks for the five gufton.

333
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,550
Here, hold on.

334
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,270
Let me show you.

335
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,270
I have a lot of fish.

336
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,090
But also...

337
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:40,970
I wanted to show you guys my golden koi fish that I got.

338
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:51,970
My first... It was my first golden anything.

339
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,150
I wonder if I sold everything, how much money would I have?

340
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,250
Would I have enough for the golden rod?

341
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,570
No, not quite.

342
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,810
Not quite.

343
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,710
It's not money, it's sand.

344
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,870
Then you convert it to money.

345
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:12,810
Or you can.

346
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:18,650
Or I could... I gotta buy this golden rod.

347
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,590
Yummy sand.

348
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,020
I want the golden rod!

349
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,700
But I also want more money.

350
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,400
Hold on, I'm just gonna do one fish.

351
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:35,640
Okay.

352
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,100
Just one.

353
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,080
Puffer fish.

354
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,780
Then they're making me money.

355
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,150
Okay, let's see what else is around in here, because they...

356
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,440
What's this?

357
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,000
North hollow house, south...

358
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,760
Sikila's fort?

359
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,740
Oh wait, cute girl ahead.

360
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,620
East?

361
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,940
Cute girl?

362
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,980
Sorry, that's west.

363
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,380
Other way.

364
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,880
Cute girl!

365
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,760
You didn't have to say anything.

366
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,920
In here?

367
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,280
Is it hot?

368
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,260
Oh no!

369
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,120
Oh no, is that the deadbeat up there?

370
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,200
A tower of suffering.

371
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,460
Oh.

372
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,840
Oh.

373
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,080
Oh.

374
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,600
Oh.

375
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,940
Oh no.

376
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,140
They just put Jump King in the cave!

377
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,360
Oh my god.

378
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,320
Wait, I think I'm stuck.

379
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:01,980
Okay, good, good.

380
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,240
No way.

381
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,060
I've never been able to beat Jump King.

382
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,340
Could I beat this instead?

383
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:10,980
I wonder.

384
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,120
Wait, why can't I...

385
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,660
Where is it?

386
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,180
Why isn't it not jumping anymore in the direction?

387
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,760
There we go.

388
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,860
Is this...

389
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,360
Does this count as a...

390
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,160
Does this count as hollow cure anymore?

391
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,340
I don't know.

392
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,560
Does this count anymore?

393
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,060
God, I keep dying here.

394
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,740
Oh no.

395
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,060
This is messed up.

396
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,320
I made it, I made it, I made it.

397
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,500
Which way is up?

398
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,020
I think I can go either way.

399
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,240
I'm feeling lucky.

400
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:15,170
I think they said QA took 3 to 4 hours...

401
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,050
for this.

402
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,410
Playtesters took 3 to 4 hours to beat this.

403
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,520
I was supposed to have two meetings tonight.

404
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,100
Well, okay, one of my meetings got cancelled.

405
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,260
And then, oh gosh, I'm such an idiot.

406
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:41,100
I put my other meeting as tonight, but it was actually last night.

407
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,560
And so I was just like, you know...

408
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,740
I'll play.

409
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,360
No!

410
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,660
I'll play, but you know like...

411
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,340
I'll only be able to play for so much.

412
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,980
Now I have all the time in the world.

413
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,380
Who is the cute girl though?

414
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,340
Who is the cute girl?

415
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,480
I must wonder.

416
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,140
Yes.

417
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,460
Yes.

418
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,640
It's at the top.

419
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,500
What, do we get to the top and there is like a mirror?

420
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,560
It's just like, you're the cute girl.

421
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,120
You're the cute girl.

422
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,020
Cute girl at bottom right of screen.

423
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,120
Yeah, QIY is right there.

424
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,360
The girl reading this.

425
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,610
I don't trust you guys.

426
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,780
We got to go through there.

427
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,980
Welcome back, it was my birthday yesterday.

428
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,620
Here is a present.

429
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,420
Happy belated birthday!

430
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,620
Thank you for the pink.

431
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,440
Are you saying Miami didn't draw a cute girl?

432
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,220
I'm just saying.

433
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,340
I'm saying.

434
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:26,860
I'm saying.

435
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:33,440
You can call a yummy mama's art cute.

436
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,360
But also cuteness is of character.

437
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,260
And I'm not cute in character.

438
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,720
I'm spooky.

439
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,720
Obviously.

440
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,980
OK, I give up.

441
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,400
I think... Wait, let me out.

442
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,040
Let me out of here.

443
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,780
Oh, escape.

444
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,860
Place check point.

445
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,760
You have to pay the place check point.

446
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,620
No way.

447
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,420
That's silly.

448
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,600
I have no patience for...

449
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,700
Jump King.

450
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,180
Reading this is the last achievement I need.

451
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,370
In level... And they are in level coins only?

452
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,050
No way.

453
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,970
No way.

454
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,810
Where are we going now?

455
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,310
To the forge?

456
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,460
I saw that... Oh my goodness.

457
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,060
I saw this in the trailer, right?

458
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,780
That there is just Minecraft.

459
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,580
Oh my god.

460
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,080
I almost got it full.

461
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,580
Oh my gosh, I took down... I took down the rock and a tree grew in its place.

462
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,660
Amazing.

463
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,220
This is just stick.

464
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,920
This is just stick.

465
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,760
Level 3?

466
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,460
Oh they have different levels.

467
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,560
OK, I'm locking in.

468
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,300
I'm locking in.

469
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,410
I need to be stronger.

470
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,450
Wait a second.

471
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,010
It didn't go all the way to the end, did it?

472
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,190
There we go.

473
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:04,650
Oh,

474
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,440
a tree grew in its place.

475
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,780
Oh, this one is easy.

476
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,240
One hard wood.

477
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:18,980
Upgrade.

478
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:19,980
Let's upgrade.

479
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,580
Craft?

480
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,500
Old... Oh no.

481
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,920
How do I make a nice axe?

482
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,440
Oh, I need to... What's commission?

483
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,120
Oh, I can make shields?

484
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,720
Why do I need a shield?

485
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,140
Why do I need a shield?

486
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,280
It's kind of scary.

487
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,380
What's this?

488
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,500
Oh, iron.

489
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,140
Iron.

490
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,000
I'm always just a little bit off.

491
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,580
I'm always just a little bit off!

492
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,780
Talk to her for explanation?

493
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,160
OK.

494
00:33:59,400 --> 00:33:59,980
Help me.

495
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,720
Help me, Kyla.

496
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,360
I'm helping take care of the forge here while my... Oh wait, that's not Kyla.

497
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,880
Oh my god, it's her sister.

498
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,860
Oh my god.

499
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,500
Just kidding.

500
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:33,180
You can craft tools and other items here that might help you on your adventures.

501
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,500
You need to go gather materials.

502
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,600
If you go further down, you'll find a bunch of trees and rocks.

503
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,260
Gather a bunch and bring them to me.

504
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,320
I'll craft whatever you want.

505
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,400
You can even make better tools to help gather stronger material.

506
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,600
Tools have different stats.

507
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,780
Powers are hard.

508
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,380
Strike how many times you get to swing your tool.

509
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,340
Gather will increase the amount of resources you gather.

510
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,460
Precision is how easy it is?

511
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:57,800
OK.

512
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,320
We offer commissions.

513
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,860
Oh, if you bring the required materials, I will give you lots of money.

514
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,900
C is pronounced like CH.

515
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,220
Oh, so like Chiquita.

516
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:19,960
Thank you.

517
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,510
What perks do we get for marrying Minto?

518
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:31,690
Can we get to cuddle your little snakes?

519
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,170
No.

520
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,090
Snake?

521
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:40,130
As soon as I get little snake, I lock him in a cabinet.

522
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,550
And he never leaves.

523
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:44,870
Shakira!

524
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,970
Shakira, Shakira.

525
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,830
Shakira, Shakira.

526
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,500
I don't...

527
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:08,840
If you were to have a Minto to marry, your perks would be...

528
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,150
You cook.

529
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,010
And I eat it.

530
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,190
Fish.

531
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,730
And...

532
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,310
What else?

533
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,880
Can we pet your cats?

534
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:46,840
Yeah!

535
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,180
Wow, Johnny!

536
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,360
Thank you for the 50...

537
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,960
Thank you, thank you.

538
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:55,940
Ectoplasm.

539
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,020
That... Oh my god, blood loss has become exhausted.

540
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,600
His name is so metal.

541
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,360
What are they adding you to holocure?

542
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,820
That doesn't make any sense.

543
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,220
I'm not in hololive.

544
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,640
That would be scary if I was in there.

545
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,200
Why?

546
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,360
Deal.

547
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,660
If you don't get the item because it is ours...

548
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,340
Oh, but you don't get the item because it's ours.

549
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,400
I hope my sister won't get mad if we pay too much.

550
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,780
Go get some materials.

551
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,800
What else can we...

552
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,940
Oh, I thought this was sparkling.

553
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,040
Is this diamond?

554
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,660
It's lead.

555
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,140
I mean... Oh, it is lead.

556
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,920
Oh my gosh, it's so fast.

557
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,640
This is only level 2.

558
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,720
I thought it was... Look, it looks like it was sparkling, right?

559
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,500
Oh my gosh.

560
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,500
Oh, whoops.

561
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,400
I wasn't paying attention.

562
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,620
Oh, I was paying attention and I suck.

563
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,400
I suck.

564
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,500
I got one plank.

565
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,060
Okay, give me some stick.

566
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,980
Oh, I can't even... I can't even get this correctly.

567
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,980
Every character has a new outfit.

568
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,140
Okay, I know.

569
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,940
I need to actually play the game.

570
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,620
Because there's new people we need to get.

571
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,920
Actually, I need to pull the gacha.

572
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,920
So I need to make... Well, I think I have enough money for gacha.

573
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,880
3 out of 3, Ms. Tatsumawashi.

574
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,220
She's blind.

575
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,260
Does that make me cuter if I'm blind?

576
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,040
Everybody loves a stupid gal.

577
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,730
I don't want to be dumb anymore.

578
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,530
Look at my Oshi.

579
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,730
She's so stupid.

580
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,450
Dumber than the rock.

581
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,430
That was even level 1, I think.

582
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,510
I'm gonna get out of the way.

583
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,170
I can't see.

584
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:31,570
What's this?

585
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,130
Oh, Iroh.

586
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,350
If you're blind, how can you see a snake?

587
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,470
That's like a sixth sense, you know?

588
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,590
I have a sixth sense for my Oshis, I think.

589
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:47,130
Well, I mean, I'm a ghost, so it's kind of a sixth sense anyway.

590
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,110
I don't know how to describe it.

591
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:55,550
I can just feel when my Oshi is around.

592
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:01,850
If I don't have my glasses on or something, but I see my Oshi on a screen...

593
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,290
And I can't see anything and they're just a blob...

594
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,890
Usually I can still identify them.

595
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,030
Give me a level 2.

596
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,270
Okay, I need more sticks.

597
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,040
You can smell them.

598
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,340
Will you be my Kamiyoshi?

599
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,660
Sure.

600
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,980
I feel like... I feel like I've never felt...

601
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,420
The way that I have...

602
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,540
In this past week.

603
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,670
I think you guys have made me...

604
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,630
I don't know how to say.

605
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,330
I think I...

606
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,560
Are you feeling love?

607
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,260
The opposite!

608
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:28,830
I don't know.

609
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:29,790
I don't know.

610
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:30,590
I was like...

611
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,670
I don't know.

612
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:36,370
Okay!

613
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,130
Oh, I need to pay attention.

614
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,040
You guys are such jerks.

615
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,340
Making me feel such a way.

616
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,640
It's like...

617
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,680
What is this?

618
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,620
Give me money.

619
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,720
Hit this critical spot...

620
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,380
To polish and increase the quality of the item.

621
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,980
What's the critical spot?

622
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,180
Here?

623
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:16,720
Here?

624
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,360
Did I make it right?

625
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,920
We are your jerks.

626
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:36,120
You won't know until you hit it.

627
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,900
Oh, the higher noise.

628
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,880
Alright, let's try this one.

629
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,320
Am I making money?

630
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,260
She's quoting Ace Attorney.

631
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,500
No one has tried to get to the top so far?

632
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:05,980
Really?

633
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,580
I have all night.

634
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,260
I have all night, baby.

635
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,820
I was gonna have some meetings and now I have all night, baby.

636
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,400
Oh, I gotta mine some more.

637
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,540
We gotta get to level 2.

638
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,780
Giving my wishing money.

639
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,100
Thank you.

640
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,380
It's so relaxing in the hollow house, so it's just kind of nice.

641
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,360
Yay!

642
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,540
Higher tier!

643
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:45,360
My wife Otacon never says she hates me and always has relevant and helpful advice.

644
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,460
Who are you?

645
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,500
Chovek, are you a snake?

646
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,200
Also, why are you awake?

647
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,460
You're like never up this... It's too late for you.

648
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,000
Go to bed.

649
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:07,890
Welcome back.

650
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:09,550
Thanks, Osni.

651
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,250
I think that I do in fact know everything.

652
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:20,310
Just because I have Doki's Oshi mark before yours doesn't mean I love you any less.

653
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:22,730
If I could have two Kamiyoshis, I would.

654
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:24,830
I appreciate it.

655
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:31,190
Wait.

656
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:32,250
Well, craft.

657
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:34,870
Insufficient... Oh.

658
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,810
Oh, there we go.

659
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:38,950
I need more stuff.

660
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,070
Basic prism.

661
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:42,410
What are these?

662
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,430
Blocks up to 7 damage from attack.

663
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:55,650
So this is stuff for like the game game?

664
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,060
My first one is JPEG.

665
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,520
Yeah, we know, Nan.

666
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,140
We know.

667
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,140
Oh my god!

668
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,660
Still got three, baby.

669
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,400
The actual game.

670
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,420
We'll get there!

671
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,740
Okay, fine.

672
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,060
I'll leave this for now.

673
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,580
We gotta go check out...

674
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,120
Which way was...

675
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:28,900
Oh, okay.

676
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,400
This way.

677
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,100
West is the casino.

678
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,880
Here comes the real games, baby!

679
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,420
Wait, what's down here?

680
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,200
What is this?

681
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,060
Remnants of a lost civilization?

682
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,570
Here we go!

683
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,730
Oh my gosh, following my...

684
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:56,350
My somewhat sister.

685
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,920
Let's go gambling!

686
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,280
Wait, I can talk?

687
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,000
I only have 100 gold carats, but...

688
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,500
Ina has a thousand gold carats.

689
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,960
Rock, paper, scissors!

690
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,140
Scissors!

691
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,320
Rock, paper, scissors!

692
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,420
Give me the money.

693
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,160
Rock, paper, scissors!

694
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,820
Rock, paper, scissors!

695
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,880
Rock, paper, scissors!

696
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,480
Rock, paper, scissors!

697
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,480
Come on!

698
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,820
Rock, paper, scissors!

699
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,540
Rock, paper, scissors!

700
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:54,500
Rock, paper... Wait, lost all our Usa coins and ran home crying.

701
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:56,920
Scissors!

702
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,740
Rock, paper, scissors!

703
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,360
Oh my god, wandering taco, please.

704
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:07,620
Lend me your strength.

705
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,520
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

706
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,120
I need scissor 61!

707
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:18,450
OK.

708
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:19,710
Fall in on!

709
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,200
What do you mean you took 296?

710
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,140
I only had 100!

711
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,530
Wait, am I in debt?

712
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:38,730
What does this mean?

713
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:44,210
Maximum bet.

714
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:46,690
How do I make more money?

715
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:47,530
Wait.

716
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:51,750
Make...

717
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,140
Convert...

718
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:00,960
Peco chips.

719
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,410
What's the prizes?

720
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,470
Holo coin prizes.

721
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,880
Definitely not a scam item.

722
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,420
Drink.

723
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,680
You will only waste your chips from buying this, actually.

724
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:39,050
But

725
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,320
it...

726
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,240
But it's...

727
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,100
Usada drink?

728
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:54,720
Just saying.

729
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,480
I don't have enough money anyway though.

730
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,360
Random assortment of fish.

731
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,180
Trails.

732
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:06,000
You guys, we have to get the cat!

733
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,860
Oh my god!

734
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,940
We can get a fucking monkey!

735
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:15,610
What?

736
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:17,750
I want the monkey!

737
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:22,090
Minky!

738
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:23,710
Oh, can I name him too?

739
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:24,230
I wonder.

740
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:25,390
Increase...

741
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,250
Gosh, there's so much here!

742
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,150
Oh my gosh, there's so much here.

743
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:33,450
Oh no.

744
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:34,210
Are you OK?

745
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:35,890
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

746
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:37,590
You don't have enough money for me.

747
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:39,630
What's this?

748
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:41,010
Higher, lower.

749
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:42,590
What's a higher, lower?

750
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,810
This is a simple game of higher, low.

751
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:47,370
First we draw a left card, face up.

752
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:49,750
All you have to do is guess whether the right card is higher or lower.

753
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,910
If you guess right, you win.

754
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,430
Also option of switching left card.

755
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:59,570
You only do that once in a game until you cash out or lose.

756
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:01,710
Higher, lower.

757
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,610
Nah, I want to go with blackjack.

758
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:07,170
Blackjack is basically the same.

759
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:07,650
What's this?

760
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:13,550
I'll lose all my money there.

761
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:15,310
Fight pit?

762
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:19,790
Oh my god, blood loss.

763
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,610
Blood loss.

764
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:31,750
Is he training?

765
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:34,450
Training?

766
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,370
It says it costs nothing.

767
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:38,330
I'm confused.

768
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:40,770
Send him to battle.

769
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:43,930
Into the...

770
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,450
I'll put it in the beginners.

771
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:45,550
Beginners.

772
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:49,390
Alright, blood loss.

773
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:50,210
You got this.

774
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:53,550
Wait, do I have to fight?

775
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:54,830
Which one is my guy?

776
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,470
Oh, there he is.

777
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:58,790
Get his ass!

778
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:00,450
Attack!

779
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:01,810
Attack!

780
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:03,510
Special?

781
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:07,930
Attack!

782
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:10,690
Get the item!

783
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:13,370
Special!

784
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:13,510
Special!

785
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:15,850
Where are you going?

786
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:17,970
Special!

787
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,510
Oh my god, he's winning.

788
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:21,830
You guys, he's actually winning.

789
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:23,050
Attack!

790
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:23,790
Attack!

791
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:26,070
Yeah, kick their asses!

792
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:26,750
Blood loss!

793
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:29,490
Cause them to have blood loss, not you!

794
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:31,770
Get up!

795
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:32,670
Get up!

796
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:34,250
My guy is almost dead.

797
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,600
How much money do I make from that?

798
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:40,640
What?

799
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:45,400
My guy came in second!

800
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,300
He came in second.

801
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,240
How much do I make?

802
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,120
Blood loss.

803
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,440
Second is first loser.

804
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,560
I have to buy out again?

805
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,780
I have to buy more?

806
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:24,250
Okay.

807
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:25,470
That's okay.

808
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:28,170
We'll go with it all in blackjack.

809
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:30,190
You guys want me to try the math quiz?

810
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:31,810
Gura.

811
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:32,590
Normal.

812
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:33,190
Challenge.

813
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:33,850
Endless.

814
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,060
Will you guys help me?

815
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:43,760
Will you guys help me?

816
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:50,450
No help.

817
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:52,310
Yeah, I expected that.

818
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,400
Wait, how do I get a...

819
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,220
Eighteen.

820
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,040
Four.

821
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,000
Eight.

822
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,540
Eighteen?

823
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,180
It's eighteen, right?

824
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,340
Thirty-eight?

825
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:38,800
Thirty-eight?

826
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,480
I can't reach him.

827
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,720
Get out of the way!

828
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,640
I can't reach him!

829
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,460
Stop!

830
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,140
I can't get to him.

831
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,060
I might be cooked.

832
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:56,920
Guys...

833
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,180
I can't reach...

834
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:01,020
This game is sabotaging me!

835
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,260
Thirty...

836
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,160
Six?

837
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,180
Six plus three is nine.

838
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:13,340
Okay, I got it.

839
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:19,810
Five?

840
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:23,630
Yeah!

841
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:27,670
Eighteen.

842
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:30,330
What

843
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:36,850
the...

844
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:38,430
Oh, six by six.

845
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:52,190
I was thinking of six by three again.

846
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,140
Thirty-six.

847
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,680
I can't get to him though.

848
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,340
This game is rigged.

849
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,960
The house always wins.

850
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,640
Move, twenty-five, move!

851
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:17,800
Yeah.

852
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,500
No cheating.

853
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,760
I use my fingers, it's not cheating.

854
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,040
Forty-five.

855
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,960
Because four plus five is nine.

856
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,680
You guys said no help and here you are in the chat.

857
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:36,560
You guys are...

858
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:37,760
Yay!

859
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,880
Can I do the slots?

860
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,020
Slots?

861
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,160
Each play costs ten chips.

862
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,740
Spin the slot to start.

863
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:05,160
Press the stop three times until they are all stopped.

864
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,480
Row or diagonal.

865
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,880
If you are lucky, the machine will go into fever.

866
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:13,040
When a mini-game appears, simply mash the button as fast as you can to win extra.

867
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,120
Okay, let's try it before I go to the...

868
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,080
Oh my gosh, there is so much.

869
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:19,640
Spin!

870
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:21,920
Stop!

871
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:21,960
Stop!

872
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,520
Stop!

873
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,300
Ah dang it.

874
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,340
Spin.

875
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:33,660
Stop.

876
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,120
Stop!

877
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:36,920
Stop it!

878
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,440
Ah dang it.

879
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,000
Stop.

880
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:42,520
Stop.

881
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,380
Stop it!

882
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,460
Ah dang it.

883
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,480
Stop it.

884
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,220
Stop it.

885
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,640
Stop.

886
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,900
Five more times.

887
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,840
We're fine, we're fine.

888
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,940
Nobody has won this before anyway though, right?

889
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,040
Stop it.

890
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:03,880
Stop it.

891
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:06,700
Stop it.

892
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:14,410
Chocolate bunny!

893
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:17,990
Stop it.

894
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:19,890
Stop it.

895
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:21,730
Stop it!

896
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:22,670
Ah, dang it.

897
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:25,730
Stop it.

898
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:26,610
Stop it.

899
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:27,950
Stop it.

900
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:32,270
So close to the seven, seven, seven.

901
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,800
So close.

902
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,240
Stop it.

903
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:40,160
Stop it.

904
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:41,280
Stop it!

905
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,520
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

906
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,820
We got ten.

907
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:54,580
Stop, stop, stop!

908
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:55,660
Ah, dang it.

909
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,700
Stop, stop, stop!

910
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,020
Ah, dang it.

911
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,040
Stop, stop!

912
00:57:59,640 --> 00:57:59,960
Stop!

913
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,320
I can't stop winning!

914
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,240
Stop, stop!

915
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,400
Stop it!

916
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,200
Dang it.

917
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:11,740
Stop, stop!

918
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:13,180
Stop it!

919
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:14,460
Stop, stop!

920
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:15,500
Stop it!

921
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,460
I can't stop winning!

922
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,320
Have I made a net positive?

923
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,680
I don't even know at this point.

924
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:25,920
Stop, stop!

925
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,080
Stop it!

926
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:27,940
Dang it.

927
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,240
Stop, stop!

928
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:31,940
Stop it!

929
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,140
Dang it.

930
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,100
Stop, stop!

931
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,400
I think you're breaking even.

932
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:44,800
Alex,

933
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:48,570
happy birthday!

934
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:51,890
Another year with our favorite silly ghost.

935
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:55,910
You start at 1100.

936
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:56,830
Stop, stop!

937
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,290
This could be it, guys.

938
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:00,350
This could be the big money.

939
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:02,830
This could be...

940
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:04,670
Big...

941
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:05,570
Money!

942
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,050
Ah, dang it.

943
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:09,690
Stop, stop!

944
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:10,610
Stop it!

945
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:11,870
Stop, stop!

946
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:13,570
Stop it!

947
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:22,270
Guys, tell me when to stop it.

948
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:24,350
Tell me!

949
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:26,190
Tell me when to stop it!

950
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:29,630
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

951
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:30,390
Now?

952
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:31,130
Stop now?

953
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:32,110
No!

954
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:33,310
Ah, dang it.

955
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:35,210
Oh, no, no, I wanted a kick.

956
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:35,830
No!

957
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:37,350
Stop, stop, stop.

958
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:38,550
Ah, okay.

959
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:39,990
We want our money back though.

960
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:40,710
Wait.

961
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:41,230
Oh.

962
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:43,030
Oh, I got some...

963
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:43,530
Kick it.

964
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:46,690
Oh, I thought kick meant like...

965
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:48,410
I thought...

966
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:49,570
Wait, huh?

967
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:51,530
I thought kick meant leave.

968
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:54,430
Oh, just kidding.

969
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:55,750
Anyway, I don't care about that.

970
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:56,350
What's over here?

971
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:57,390
We know this is blackjack.

972
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:57,990
What's this one?

973
00:59:59,210 --> 00:59:59,690
Sorry.

974
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:02,810
Double blackjack.

975
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:03,090
Okay.

976
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:05,450
And this one is what?

977
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:07,090
Roulette.

978
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:10,870
Put in the chips in the color slot.

979
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,910
Each slot has a different payout, but it's multiplier.

980
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:19,350
You put in ten chips in pink, you'll win back a hundred and ten chips.

981
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:21,930
Sounds like I'm scamming them.

982
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:23,930
Oops, sorry.

983
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:27,310
Sorry, I accidentally clicked out of the game.

984
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:28,050
I don't care.

985
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:29,050
Let's play blackjack.

986
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,920
Guys, I forgot how to play blackjack.

987
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,080
No, no, no.

988
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:39,520
I didn't.

989
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,040
I can bribe them.

990
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,980
I was watching your re-debut and I missed...

991
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:53,160
That I miss that you're great and your singing is just divine, exquisite, ten out of ten.

992
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,040
And you're stinky.

993
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:54,800
Hey!

994
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,560
Goose, thank you.

995
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:57,260
Oh, you're drunk.

996
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,000
Don't super chat drunk.

997
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,000
I think I should hit.

998
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,340
Because otherwise he's just gonna win.

999
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:06,280
Hit!

1000
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,400
All in,

1001
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:20,230
baby.

1002
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:40,410
Yippee!

1003
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:42,170
Play again.

1004
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,080
This is a little terrifying.

1005
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:54,720
What happens if I bri...

1006
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:54,880
Oh.

1007
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,960
Spend 25% of current bet to increase chance of bribing the dealer.

1008
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,580
If successful, the next draw will get to blackjack.

1009
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:02,200
If possible, or a ten.

1010
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,800
I love blackjack.

1011
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:13,730
Oh my god, I love blackjack.

1012
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,000
I'll super chat while I'm not drunk in the future.

1013
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:19,700
Hit.

1014
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:22,280
Hit.

1015
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:29,720
This is the thrill, everybody.

1016
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,120
This is the thrill.

1017
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,500
Oh, hit.

1018
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:46,450
I wish there was an all in.

1019
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:47,810
There should be a double down.

1020
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:49,710
There should be a double down.

1021
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:53,990
Stay, but that's no fun.

1022
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:02,270
If I...

1023
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:03,910
If I don't...

1024
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:04,910
If I...

1025
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:05,970
Where's the...

1026
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:06,930
I mean...

1027
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:07,770
We gotta...

1028
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:10,030
Hit!

1029
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,660
I was just alive!

1030
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:22,460
Why?

1031
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,920
Because that's the thrill of the game!

1032
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,240
Why else do you think I love blackjack so much?

1033
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:30,820
This is the thrill, everybody.

1034
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:32,280
This is the thrill.

1035
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:33,760
You don't understand!

1036
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,920
You don't understand.

1037
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:37,940
Cowards won't get it.

1038
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:41,320
Cowards won't...

1039
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:41,880
Hit.

1040
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,100
It's okay, this is the thrill.

1041
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:47,980
Always hit.

1042
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,300
Always hit.

1043
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:56,380
Hit.

1044
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:57,560
Hit.

1045
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:03,520
This is so much fun.

1046
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,920
Oh my gosh, this is everything that I love.

1047
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:07,140
Hit!

1048
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:09,060
You

1049
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:23,100
son of a bitch!

1050
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,280
What are you doing here?

1051
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:27,580
I lost all my chips, everybody.

1052
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:39,680
I just want to keep playing blackjack, but I have to save my money for also gacha.

1053
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:42,300
What's... Wait, build mo...

1054
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,980
Oh, that's for the house.

1055
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:44,400
Just kidding.

1056
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:48,280
I'm ready.

1057
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,640
Wait, this table is bad.

1058
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:51,200
It's this table that's good.

1059
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,480
Cowards wouldn't get it.

1060
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,820
Soon to be a homeless ghost.

1061
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,020
It's the real thrill though.

1062
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,260
It's the real thrill.

1063
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:05,320
Don't you think?

1064
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:10,520
I got enough for the monkey, only to lose it trying to get more coins.

1065
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,220
But I got it back.

1066
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:12,520
See?

1067
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,180
You're not allowed to go to Vegas, Minto.

1068
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:19,580
Probably not.

1069
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:22,120
I'm probably wanted there.

1070
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,640
Oh my gosh, I love blackjack.

1071
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,660
Okay, confirm bet.

1072
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:27,860
Alright, we got this, guys.

1073
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:29,520
Believe.

1074
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:39,210
I want to hit so bad.

1075
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:42,370
I want to hit so bad.

1076
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,800
I want to hit so bad.

1077
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,700
Okay, I'll stand.

1078
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:19,450
I felt no satisfaction in that whatsoever.

1079
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,500
I felt no satisfaction in that whatsoever, by the way.

1080
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:33,700
Minto is so cute.

1081
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,360
I don't know why she doesn't get more proposals.

1082
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,120
Sorry, I can't.

1083
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,020
I already have a 100% real wife.

1084
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:40,620
And you'd gamble my life savings.

1085
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,680
Stop bragging.

1086
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,460
I already have a wife.

1087
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,540
You mean our wife.

1088
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:02,960
Okay, one more.

1089
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,100
One more.

1090
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:12,120
See, when you're on 16, it's really just kind of like a...

1091
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:12,980
What do I do?

1092
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,100
This is where the real thrill happens.

1093
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,520
Wait, huh?

1094
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,280
Oh, it turned to 13.

1095
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,300
Oh, we would have lost.

1096
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,940
That's the real thrill, baby.

1097
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,040
How long have I been playing blackjack for?

1098
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:36,140
Sorry.

1099
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,900
Should we go do some gacha?

1100
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:44,410
I wanna play more blackjack.

1101
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,380
Oh, my guys are tired.

1102
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,640
Okay, I'll go feed them.

1103
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,400
I'm getting lightheaded.

1104
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:02,320
Hold on, I need to eat some rice.

1105
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,560
Winners never quit and quitters never win.

1106
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:26,700
Exactly.

1107
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:29,480
Give me my money.

1108
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:39,690
Just add a 1 to this blackjack.

1109
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,350
Wait, can't you...you can't do...

1110
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:45,750
Why didn't you add the 1?

1111
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,040
Why didn't you add it?

1112
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:55,960
Can't you do custom numbers?

1113
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:57,280
Not in the budget.

1114
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:00,500
I sound so greedy.

1115
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,440
Why didn't you donate a dollar to me?

1116
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:03,360
Oh, my god.

1117
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,080
How dare you.

1118
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,400
Pass my PhD thesis to birds.

1119
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:07,900
Oh, my gosh.

1120
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,500
Algernon, congratulations!

1121
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:12,760
Bust.

1122
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:15,260
Bust!

1123
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:17,820
That's the thrill of it.

1124
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:22,680
Alright.

1125
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:29,650
Let's go to shop and character gacha.

1126
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:31,550
Oh, whoops.

1127
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:32,410
I didn't mean to do that.

1128
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:39,670
Wow, it's so crazy.

1129
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:42,690
So...

1130
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:44,450
That's...

1131
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:45,450
I like all the new ones.

1132
01:09:45,570 --> 01:09:46,670
The new...

1133
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:47,910
I like the whole design here.

1134
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,750
It's so nice.

1135
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:52,510
Shall we fantasy?

1136
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:54,750
Oh, yeah.

1137
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:55,430
The new outfits.

1138
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:56,530
That's right.

1139
01:09:57,330 --> 01:09:58,430
Kiwawa new outfit.

1140
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:01,850
Oh, my gosh.

1141
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:03,870
I love this one.

1142
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:07,130
Is this the space outfit?

1143
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,220
I want it.

1144
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:16,980
I want...

1145
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,340
Well, this one was already in there, right?

1146
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,400
But I want it.

1147
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,380
I want it.

1148
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,160
What if I just like...

1149
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,160
Ten time gacha.

1150
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,600
Let's see what we get.

1151
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:35,960
A single...

1152
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,660
Just a single outfit.

1153
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:38,840
Oh, wait.

1154
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:39,700
You guys can't see it.

1155
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:39,980
Sorry.

1156
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,860
I got the Ame outfit.

1157
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,540
Yeah, I'll make myself small.

1158
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:48,650
Ame outfit.

1159
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:52,090
Hold on.

1160
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:53,250
I have a Katsukare.

1161
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:54,550
Today.

1162
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:04,840
Again.

1163
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:05,180
Again.

1164
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,300
We got two outfits, actually.

1165
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:16,940
Oh, three outfits.

1166
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:17,680
Oh, my god.

1167
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:18,720
Look at us go.

1168
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:20,580
Cat Wawa.

1169
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:31,280
I was all time top five with Azuki.

1170
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:35,320
FWR coin farmer character.

1171
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,460
Bald Minto said she don't mind out.

1172
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,140
I'm not bald.

1173
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:45,700
Do you still want some tips for farming coins?

1174
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:46,200
Sure.

1175
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,360
I'll take it.

1176
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,620
Sorry, I got so hungry all of a sudden.

1177
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:51,760
I just gotta...

1178
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,180
Let me have a little bit of a bite.

1179
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,100
Unlucky.

1180
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:11,620
Unlucky.

1181
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,320
Pekora is good for farming?

1182
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:21,640
Okay, let's try it.

1183
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:22,440
Let's try...

1184
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:36,960
I could buy it, but there's no fun in that.

1185
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:40,280
Wait.

1186
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:48,040
Wow, they even added the new Chuni one.

1187
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:50,020
Wait.

1188
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,820
They hate me.

1189
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:58,780
Wait.

1190
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:01,700
They hate me.

1191
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,160
No Gauze.

1192
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,540
Oh, but we got Gauze the mermaid.

1193
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,000
No Gauze Fauna.

1194
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:12,020
So sad.

1195
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,580
So sad.

1196
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:28,550
Witch hat is Gauze Fauna?

1197
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:35,170
Fauna sees hat.

1198
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:37,170
I

1199
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:42,450
thought the witch outfit...

1200
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:43,470
No, Gauze Fauna...

1201
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:46,450
Has the short hair.

1202
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:00,690
Long and short.

1203
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:03,170
Oh my god, I never even realized.

1204
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:04,590
What?

1205
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:06,650
What?

1206
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:08,930
I never even realized it.

1207
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:13,110
They added so many outfits.

1208
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:14,510
It's a toggle.

1209
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:17,350
How exciting.

1210
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:23,230
She doesn't know everything about Fauna, big fan.

1211
01:14:26,430 --> 01:14:28,730
How dare she claim to love Fauna...

1212
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:31,530
When she doesn't even know...

1213
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:35,590
Her cup size.

1214
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:40,590
I felt those bad boys with my bare hands...

1215
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:44,430
Was able to measure the circumference based upon the shadows from the sun.

1216
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:00,960
What was I saying?

1217
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:02,780
Okay, anyway.

1218
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:04,000
We must...

1219
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
We must...

1220
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:07,380
Pull.

1221
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:13,590
It's a Gisado!

1222
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:16,690
Actually, we got a good amount of...

1223
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:18,310
Good amount of outfits.

1224
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:18,710
Nice.

1225
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:19,410
Okay, one more.

1226
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:25,010
No new outfits.

1227
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:26,390
One more, one more.

1228
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:32,830
Why no new outfits?

1229
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:33,170
Outfits.

1230
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:36,970
Why no new outfits?

1231
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:41,250
Yeah, I got the Fauna outfit.

1232
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:42,830
Because she has the...

1233
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:45,830
So cute.

1234
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:47,390
But I don't have this one.

1235
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:48,770
The kimono one.

1236
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:50,610
Use tears?

1237
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:51,870
No, that's no fun.

1238
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:54,350
Okay, one more.

1239
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:56,930
One more.

1240
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:02,490
We got Iris outfit.

1241
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:07,850
Okay, let's see.

1242
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:13,150
How much do you bet we can get all four of them...

1243
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:14,970
In one go?

1244
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:19,230
No gacha, no live.

1245
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:23,890
Zero?

1246
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:29,010
Why don't you have faith in me?

1247
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:30,970
Four dupes?

1248
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:33,350
Come on.

1249
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:00,880
Man, Noel just kind of...

1250
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,100
Did you change your YouTube channel icon?

1251
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:10,320
I noticed it was different during your hiatus.

1252
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:12,800
No.

1253
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:17,410
No.

1254
01:17:21,690 --> 01:17:23,410
It's my birthday weekend.

1255
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:24,510
Oh my gosh!

1256
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:25,510
Chikara Chikara!

1257
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:27,510
Happy early birthday.

1258
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:30,730
Welcome back.

1259
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:33,490
Hope you had a fantom-tastic week.

1260
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:34,130
You too!

1261
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:46,290
Wait, who am I missing?

1262
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:47,870
Pekora!

1263
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:50,430
Oh, it has a little check mark.

1264
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:51,630
That's so cute now.

1265
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:57,070
So these everybody didn't have just two outfits?

1266
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:02,210
Oh, I love this Peko outfit though.

1267
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:02,770
So cute.

1268
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:04,870
Pen Peko.

1269
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:06,610
Pen Peko.

1270
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:09,670
We got her this time.

1271
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:30,530
Gifted.

1272
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:37,170
Oops, I'll Peko.

1273
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:39,910
Peko, Peko, Peko.

1274
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:41,850
Yay!

1275
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:44,110
All four in one go.

1276
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:44,910
Draw a heart.

1277
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:54,070
That's the Minto way.

1278
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:55,150
The Minto luck.

1279
01:18:58,090 --> 01:19:01,210
I just got back from my trip to Japan and changed your opening...

1280
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:02,970
And you changed your opening screen to Akihabara.

1281
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:05,490
Yeah, I love Akihabara.

1282
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:09,470
And my ending screen is also Akihabara.

1283
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:12,530
All Akihabara.

1284
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:14,330
I should try...

1285
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:14,830
I want to...

1286
01:19:14,830 --> 01:19:15,270
Okay, hold on.

1287
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:17,890
Let's try and get all the outfits.

1288
01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:18,890
Wait, I'm missing...

1289
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:23,890
Marine's and Pekora's second outfits.

1290
01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:24,990
I think we can get it in five.

1291
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:26,190
I think we can get it in five.

1292
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:42,530
Has Mint seen Marine's new skill yet?

1293
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:43,610
I haven't seen anything yet.

1294
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:47,470
Okay, fine.

1295
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:50,430
Oh, we have a whole other...

1296
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:54,590
We have a whole other generation to do.

1297
01:19:57,610 --> 01:20:00,970
How much do you want to say I can get all five in one pull?

1298
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:04,550
Yeah, no spoilers everybody.

1299
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:06,530
You're kind of bad at this.

1300
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:08,610
It's...

1301
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:10,550
It's gacha.

1302
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:14,670
How do I...

1303
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:16,330
How am I bad at gacha?

1304
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:17,550
What do you...

1305
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:20,330
Is that a skill thing?

1306
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:36,140
Okay.

1307
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:38,800
Oh wait, I want to see their other outfits.

1308
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:40,700
Stop, stop.

1309
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:43,300
Oh, I like this one.

1310
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:46,940
Is that her pajamas?

1311
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,860
Oh, I was hoping the second outfit would be the dragon.

1312
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:53,520
That one.

1313
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,800
I love the short hair Luna.

1314
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:56,680
Okay.

1315
01:20:58,060 --> 01:20:59,040
Here we go.

1316
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:01,420
All five in one.

1317
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:06,320
I'm not looking, I'm not looking, I'm not looking, I'm not looking, I'm not looking.

1318
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:07,940
Can I get all five in one?

1319
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:15,100
I was so close!

1320
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,080
No way!

1321
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:23,340
Toa-sama.

1322
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:24,700
Why?

1323
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:27,960
I was so close.

1324
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:29,480
Alright, one more.

1325
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:36,450
The game was like...

1326
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:38,090
You wanted Kanatan?

1327
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:39,050
Okay, sorry.

1328
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:39,730
My bad.

1329
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:54,500
How is this possible?

1330
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,280
Not everybody they added, right?

1331
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:02,940
It's everybody they added, right?

1332
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:24,650
Okay, you need to buy the new things from the shop.

1333
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:25,530
You're right!

1334
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:28,410
These, the holds.

1335
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:34,310
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.

1336
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:37,590
Allows weapons to be disabled in the armory.

1337
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:41,530
Do I need this?

1338
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:45,490
Let's have a...

1339
01:22:45,490 --> 01:22:46,670
Oh yeah, yeah, buy that.

1340
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:48,170
Buy the fan letter.

1341
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:53,500
Buy this.

1342
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:01,960
It's not everything, right?

1343
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:03,900
I probably should grab for now.

1344
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:10,860
Looks like it helps you tailor your build more.

1345
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:11,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1346
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:13,560
I don't really...

1347
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:16,560
I guess if I'm like trying for a certain achievement or something.

1348
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,720
I can show you my guys on my...

1349
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:19,920
Oh wait, what's the new achievements?

1350
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:20,920
Where?

1351
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:21,320
Oh here.

1352
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:22,900
Achievements.

1353
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:23,860
Oh, fan letters.

1354
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,940
There's 82 of them!

1355
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:28,280
Oh my goodness.

1356
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,140
See, I haven't defeated stage 4 yet.

1357
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:38,920
Now there's even a stage 5!

1358
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,660
Maybe we'll try for stage 4 today.

1359
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:46,900
And complete the armory.

1360
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:47,800
I haven't done that yet.

1361
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,080
But I feel like I've gotten a good amount of stuff.

1362
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:54,140
There's like some of these that I haven't done.

1363
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:57,420
That I still need to do.

1364
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:58,840
Win a worker race.

1365
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,760
What's this?

1366
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:04,420
Is that...

1367
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:05,600
Is that a skill?

1368
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,040
Get 100,000 USA chips.

1369
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:10,300
Get a pet.

1370
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:11,660
I'm gonna do that!

1371
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:24,220
Win a jackpot!

1372
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:27,160
Sell 10 stamps in one run.

1373
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:31,580
Is this new?

1374
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:35,660
Is this Narissa's feather?

1375
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,460
Clear stage mode.

1376
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:39,960
Run after dying 3 times with chicken feathers.

1377
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:43,140
New items.

1378
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:45,200
Wait, what are these ones?

1379
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,540
No Elp.

1380
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:57,260
That's...

1381
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:59,020
You make no sense!

1382
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:02,440
I'm asking who are they associated with?

1383
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:05,460
Oh, top is the promise tiara.

1384
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,320
Oh, cute!

1385
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:08,220
And then this one is which?

1386
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:11,720
Mirika.

1387
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:12,340
Oh!

1388
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:14,900
I see, I see, I see.

1389
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,120
Clear the tower.

1390
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:18,940
I think you need more money than that.

1391
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:22,020
For clearing the tower of suffering, I'm just saying.

1392
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,600
I see, I see, I see.

1393
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:31,600
I've got 82 out of 200.

1394
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,280
I've got 40% complete.

1395
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:35,400
It's not so bad, I suppose.

1396
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,020
Not so bad, I suppose.

1397
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,300
Look, they're so shiny.

1398
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:40,760
Look!

1399
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:42,420
Oh my gosh, we have the whole...

1400
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:44,080
We have the whole cast.

1401
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:45,360
Yippee!

1402
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,020
Alright, let's actually play the game.

1403
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:50,920
Who should I play as first?

1404
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:57,980
Roll slots.

1405
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:01,080
Deal 1000% damage to all targets if jackpot is rolled.

1406
01:26:04,650 --> 01:26:06,890
Wait, I have to gacha in this too?

1407
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:10,730
Wait, I have to gacha in this too?

1408
01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:12,230
Marine.

1409
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:18,030
All weapon sizes increased.

1410
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:24,850
Summon a number of Flare Blasters that shoot wide beams at targets to deal 300% damage.

1411
01:26:24,970 --> 01:26:27,390
Cocoa transforms into her true dragon form for 8 seconds.

1412
01:26:29,650 --> 01:26:30,890
Slowly heal 10%.

1413
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:35,310
Towa quotes a heavy machine gun and gains 100 ammo.

1414
01:26:37,510 --> 01:26:38,550
Fires multiple...

1415
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:40,450
This one reminds me of...

1416
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:43,430
There's another thing that you have like...

1417
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:43,870
What is it?

1418
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:46,450
I can't remember.

1419
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:48,450
There's another one that you have...

1420
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:54,810
Like a certain amount of ammo with.

1421
01:26:58,180 --> 01:26:58,420
Hello!

1422
01:26:58,680 --> 01:26:59,960
Welcome to membership, aren't you?

1423
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:05,360
Fires multiple beams in all directions to deal rapid damage.

1424
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:09,640
Create a concert of music notes around Luna, dealing constant damage.

1425
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:10,540
Cute.

1426
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:13,320
Okay, I guess...

1427
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:15,600
Some people said... A lot of people said Marine.

1428
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:16,880
Oh, the Reine Punch!

1429
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:18,420
Yes, that's what I was thinking of.

1430
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:19,160
Yeah, thank you.

1431
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Reine Punch.

1432
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:24,900
Yeah, yeah.

1433
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:25,280
Okay.

1434
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:28,680
Marine has the funniest skills?

1435
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:32,000
I'll go with endless mode then.

1436
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:39,220
We'll go... Actually, well, maybe I'll go stage mode so I can try...

1437
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:40,100
Everybody out.

1438
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,200
We'll just do the office.

1439
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:54,660
No L.

1440
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:56,020
Where

1441
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:07,040
did I get these from?

1442
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,280
Control for your support item.

1443
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,000
Oh, thank you.

01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:14,480

Gains invincibility for one second.

1446
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:17,280
Yeah.

1447
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:22,760
Oh, in the shop.

1448
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,940
Thank you for the 50 gifts inside!

1449
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:27,540
Thank you!

1450
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:29,680
Oh my gosh.

1451
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,040
Thank you, thank you so much!

1452
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,780
I guess I'll try... Wait, so if I...

1453
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:39,380
Use it, do I lose it?

1454
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:40,940
Like, rather, is it one time use?

1455
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,480
I like her vibe in YouTube clips.

1456
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:47,420
Of who?

1457
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:47,760
Marine?

1458
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:53,760
Oh, it has a cooldown.

1459
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:54,960
Ah, I see, I see.

1460
01:28:55,740 --> 01:29:00,780
It was my birthday on the 11th and I thought I'd take this opportunity to thank you and all the Wisps for the amazing time I've had in this community.

1461
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:02,380
Oh, Nashi!

1462
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:06,840
So grateful to be here with you all, keep being awesome.

1463
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:07,180
You!

1464
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,820
I'm sorry I missed your birthday!

1465
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:14,040
Happy birthday to you!

1466
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,760
Happy birthday to you!

1467
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:19,720
Happy birthday, dear Nashi!

1468
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,860
Happy birthday to you!

1469
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:26,400
Happy birthday!

1470
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:30,860
Also, I'm gonna call you out, Sanada.

1471
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:32,360
You don't have to be rude.

1472
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,380
I'm asking if a support item, I have to buy it each time I want to use it in a stage.

1473
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:42,740
I can read the yellow here.

1474
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,640
Cooldown 10 seconds.

1475
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,120
I can read.

1476
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:50,340
I just wanted to see if it was... You buy it every time.

1477
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:50,840
Gosh.

1478
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,100
Gosh.

1479
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:56,400
No need to be rude.

1480
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:09,320
Just select and use.

1481
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,080
Let's try it.

1482
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:13,880
What's her...

1483
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,940
Oh, she's got like a range.

1484
01:30:15,940 --> 01:30:17,360
Oh my gosh, and it's homing.

1485
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:18,120
That's insane.

1486
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:20,320
What the...

1487
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,540
That's actually... Wow, that's so nice.

1488
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:25,080
Oh my gosh, we already got a sticker.

1489
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:28,300
Let's go.

1490
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:29,740
I never get stickers so early.

1491
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:39,780
Gain of Lust gauge?

1492
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:43,240
The gauge increases slowly near enemies...

1493
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:44,080
Or when hit.

1494
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,240
A max gauge.

1495
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:51,900
Marine reaches her climax.

1496
01:30:57,470 --> 01:30:58,490
Healing 20%.

1497
01:30:58,490 --> 01:31:02,050
Is this why you guys wanted me to play as Marine first?

1498
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:12,830
Oh, what the...

1499
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:14,510
Oh, that's the material.

1500
01:31:14,730 --> 01:31:15,470
Oh my gosh.

1501
01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:18,110
They dropped the material.

1502
01:31:18,230 --> 01:31:18,930
That's so nice.

1503
01:31:19,090 --> 01:31:20,150
Wait, we gotta get closer.

1504
01:31:20,150 --> 01:31:21,190
No!

1505
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:23,650
This way.

1506
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:24,730
I wanna go this way.

1507
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:26,650
Oh my gosh.

1508
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:29,410
Pistol shoots two shots.

1509
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:31,930
Let's go.

1510
01:31:32,890 --> 01:31:35,190
Wait, I didn't read what the Pirate's Captain did.

1511
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:35,770
My bad.

1512
01:31:36,970 --> 01:31:37,970
I didn't read it.

1513
01:31:39,610 --> 01:31:41,290
I'm too... Wait, what?

1514
01:31:42,050 --> 01:31:43,590
I'm too much...

1515
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:46,090
Too old to support my Oshis openly day to day.

1516
01:31:46,690 --> 01:31:49,010
Can only really do it at home via super chats.

1517
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:50,390
Long story short, I'm glad you're here.

1518
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:51,030
What?

1519
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:52,230
What are you talking about?

1520
01:31:55,070 --> 01:31:56,670
Thank you for the Haka Super.

1521
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:57,390
Thank you!

1522
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:07,130
When collecting Holo Coins, increase crit by 1% for 5 seconds, up to 10%.

1523
01:32:07,950 --> 01:32:10,050
Targets hit by skills...

1524
01:32:11,070 --> 01:32:13,570
Targets hit by skills has a 10% chance to drop additional...

1525
01:32:15,650 --> 01:32:16,050
Mine.

1526
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:17,890
Oh my gosh, wait.

1527
01:32:18,050 --> 01:32:19,290
I kinda want them to hit me though.

1528
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:20,890
Nice.

1529
01:32:23,310 --> 01:32:25,530
I wanna level up my skills first.

1530
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:28,690
Okay!

1531
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:34,090
Mint Phantom would have the same ability as Les Gage, except it's called Freak Gage.

1532
01:32:58,140 --> 01:32:58,740
Yeah.

1533
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:02,640
Yeah.

1534
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,340
Say the line, Mint.

1535
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:08,460
The famous Mighty in Quote.

1536
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:11,140
Ahoy?

1537
01:33:14,490 --> 01:33:16,050
Oh my god, more Lust.

1538
01:33:16,850 --> 01:33:18,930
Yeah, I think I'd have a Freak Gage.

1539
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:27,480
I hate this.

1540
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:32,240
But I hate that it's so accurate, probably.

1541
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:43,780
Did we just take off our...

1542
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:46,620
We just woohooed in the game!

1543
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,620
It became The Sims for a moment!

1544
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:51,420
Dr. Worm!

1545
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:52,140
Welcome to the membership!

1546
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:52,780
Thank you!

1547
01:33:58,470 --> 01:34:00,130
We woohooed in the game.

1548
01:34:05,230 --> 01:34:09,950
I like Mighty's Elage, because she's got like the homing and then also the...

1549
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:14,690
She's got the pistol and then also the slashy slash.

1550
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:15,610
It's so nice.

1551
01:34:19,210 --> 01:34:24,870
Thanks Kay for the update and thank you for the whole Holocure team as well.

1552
01:34:26,290 --> 01:34:28,570
Stupid idiot being like...

1553
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:38,300
Gave us like a bajillion minigames in one.

1554
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:44,980
Come here.

1555
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,420
Come here everybody.

1556
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:49,520
Oh, it hurts so good.

1557
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:52,560
Oh god, why is she naked all of a sudden?

1558
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:56,420
Oh wait, what's my...

1559
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:03,880
If a target is within 80...

1560
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:13,240
Within 80 pixels for more than one second, they gain a debuff that reduces defense.

1561
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:15,320
Are you calling her stinky?

1562
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:21,160
Oh my gosh, wait, I'm excited for all the new... What's it called?

1563
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,760
All the new collabs too.

1564
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,920
Oh my god, take my stench!

1565
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:29,260
Take it!

1566
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,040
Take it!

1567
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:31,660
Oh,

1568
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:42,740
you know what?

1569
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:43,100
I'll take it.

1570
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:45,120
Oh wait, let's try my special.

1571
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:46,500
Oh, just kidding.

1572
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:49,480
Here we go!

1573
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:54,380
Oh my god.

1574
01:35:56,740 --> 01:35:57,120
Cute!

1575
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:01,420
Hold on, I'm trying to bust this open.

1576
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:01,940
There we go.

1577
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,240
Nice, we're almost to full.

1578
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:08,540
Upgrading my stench.

1579
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,780
This is so messed up.

1580
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:18,160
Oh, money!

1581
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:19,480
Give me the money!

1582
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:22,600
Wait, oh, I'm like dying for real.

1583
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:24,980
There we go.

1584
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:26,600
Awakened.

1585
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:27,620
Let's go.

1586
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:28,740
Oh.

1587
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:36,100
Oh my gosh, why can't I hit him?

1588
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:37,520
Am I stupid?

1589
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:37,960
There we go.

1590
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:39,020
Flower.

1591
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:47,970
Take my stench.

1592
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:49,210
Out of context Minto.

1593
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:54,190
Yeah, drink some water.

1594
01:36:56,850 --> 01:36:59,230
Smelly, smelly, smelly, smelly.

1595
01:36:59,230 --> 01:36:59,370
Take it.

1596
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:07,960
I'm so used to... How do I... What's the range on it now?

1597
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:11,760
I'm so used to playing this game off stream now.

1598
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:15,060
I'm like used to just not talking while I play it.

1599
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:22,780
Oh yeah, the more coins.

1600
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:26,340
More coins.

1601
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:28,340
The smell range is crazy.

1602
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:32,480
Yeah, actually...

1603
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,940
This is why I...

1604
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:37,480
Actually, last time I...

1605
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,480
Last time I saw Matara...

1606
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:43,600
She left like a bunch of her stuff with me.

1607
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,600
And one of it was her perfumes.

1608
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,580
But I really like it.

1609
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:49,000
I told her.

1610
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:50,280
She was like...

1611
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:53,400
She was like, you can get rid of all the other stuff, but keep the perfume.

1612
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:54,140
It smells so good.

1613
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:55,840
I've been using it.

1614
01:37:58,440 --> 01:37:59,220
Okay, hold on.

1615
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:04,000
So, oh yeah, I have all these collabs now, by the way.

1616
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:05,540
Like I've gotten more of them.

1617
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:08,220
But what are the new ones?

1618
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:09,060
I guess...

1619
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:12,480
I wouldn't know, because I don't have any of the new... I gotta get new items first, huh?

1620
01:38:15,620 --> 01:38:17,960
Why do our noses run when our feet smell?

1621
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:25,240
How long can you go without talking on stream?

1622
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:29,160
Do you wanna see?

1623
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,460
No.

1624
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:35,400
You need the new weapon from beating level 5.

1625
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:36,580
Yeah, I need the new weapon.

1626
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:37,900
I haven't even beat level 4!

1627
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:42,560
Okay, after this, after this we'll try and beat level 4.

1628
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,190
Even if it's not a new...

1629
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:48,620
Oh wait, where are these hearts coming from?

1630
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:51,360
Where are the hearts coming from?

1631
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:54,120
Even if it's not a new character.

1632
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:55,860
What the...

1633
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:02,020
Minto smells like Matora.

1634
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:06,200
So if she calls me smelly, she's basically just calling herself smelly.

1635
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,760
You know what, we'll do this.

1636
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:11,480
That actually works out.

1637
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:22,460
She's like my stinky GF, well...

1638
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:23,740
You know what, I am gonna get the limiter.

1639
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:24,800
Because I'm lazy.

1640
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:30,280
I don't know how to describe it though.

1641
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:31,920
The perfume.

1642
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:34,820
I don't even know the name of it.

1643
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:36,340
I love the smell of mint.

1644
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:38,420
Mint peppermint.

1645
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:42,920
I could tell you guys and then you could get the same thing and be like...

1646
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:47,480
I'm using the same perfume as my...

1647
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:50,480
Oh my gosh, and then if you get my dakimakura you could spray it on there.

1648
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:51,920
And then it would really...

1649
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:54,140
Really smell like it.

1650
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:00,540
Yes, I will buy it.

1651
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:01,900
Okay, I'll DM it to you, Oimo.

1652
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:05,440
I don't know the name of it.

1653
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:09,540
It's in my bathroom, so...

1654
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:11,100
Speaking of Matara, did you unblock her?

1655
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:12,640
Oh yeah, I did unblock her.

1656
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:14,380
Unfortunately.

1657
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:18,980
Yeah, I unblocked her, unfortunately.

1658
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:24,920
But I haven't followed her.

1659
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:27,580
It's really just a...

1660
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:29,780
How do I say?

1661
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:36,180
It's a matter of pride now.

1662
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:37,640
Who follows who first.

1663
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:45,840
Upgrade.

1664
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:50,700
I need more haste.

1665
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:53,380
I need more haste.

1666
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:54,580
Nice.

1667
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:57,220
Yummy.

1668
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:02,800
Does her perfume smell like teen spirit?

1669
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:09,820
Surely there is a perfume called teen spirit, right?

1670
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:10,800
Surely.

1671
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,080
There has to be.

1672
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:16,200
Surely.

1673
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,220
Pride is at stake, exactly.

1674
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:20,980
You won't see me.

1675
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,960
You won't see me following her first, I'll tell you that.

1676
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:29,680
Teen spirit is a deodorant.

1677
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,400
It is?

1678
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,620
It's a deodorant.

1679
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:37,560
No way.

1680
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,600
Wait, so this...

1681
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:42,320
What's Mari...

1682
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:47,060
Where is my stamps?

1683
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:56,590
Hurt me good.

1684
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:02,330
Where is my... Oh, there it is.

1685
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:08,530
Let's just keep upgrading this and then I'll combo them.

1686
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:22,040
I need more lust.

1687
01:42:26,750 --> 01:42:28,270
Wait, my team feels so broken.

1688
01:42:28,370 --> 01:42:29,050
It's awesome.

1689
01:42:32,010 --> 01:42:33,310
Minto doesn't smell like mint?

1690
01:42:33,670 --> 01:42:34,710
There goes my plans.

1691
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:35,710
What are you talking about?

1692
01:42:35,870 --> 01:42:37,850
What plans?

1693
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:41,730
What are you talking about?

1694
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:45,830
There is an achievement for 500 pick-up range.

1695
01:42:55,730 --> 01:42:57,090
Heart, meat, kettle.

1696
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:01,120
My re-debut won't be that hype phantom.

1697
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:10,820
Yeah, but that's... My re-debut is not a whole ass game, OK?

1698
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:15,380
My re-debut is not a game.

1699
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:24,970
Peko and Coco are the broken ones.

1700
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:25,250
Really?

1701
01:43:27,450 --> 01:43:28,910
I haven't even reached it.

1702
01:43:28,950 --> 01:43:31,550
I haven't even reached it yet.

1703
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:34,970
Let's just grab all of these for now.

1704
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:36,210
Chanceler!

1705
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:37,610
Thanks for the 10 gift.

1706
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:39,250
Thank you.

1707
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:45,170
There was a game though.

1708
01:43:47,030 --> 01:43:48,150
It's different.

1709
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:51,510
It's different.

1710
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:55,330
Thank you for reminding me.

1711
01:43:55,870 --> 01:43:57,470
I have to do stuff for that tonight.

1712
01:43:57,610 --> 01:43:58,470
I have to message people.

1713
01:44:01,410 --> 01:44:03,510
I think I'm gonna post...

1714
01:44:05,850 --> 01:44:12,570
I want to have more people to have a chance to be in the game.

1715
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:14,510
So I might do like a...

1716
01:44:14,510 --> 01:44:15,750
Have like, you know...

1717
01:44:17,930 --> 01:44:18,830
What's the word?

1718
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:21,830
Like I might post on Twitter if any like...

1719
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:23,830
Other Vtubers...

1720
01:44:25,450 --> 01:44:29,710
Want to be in it and then have it like a random chance.

1721
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:30,830
Rather like...

1722
01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:34,430
Cause then I could be like... Go to someone like kind of small, you know?

1723
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:39,390
And then they could be in the game.

1724
01:44:43,890 --> 01:44:44,330
So...

1725
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,600
I was joking with the sweepstakes.

1726
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:55,200
Oh, I didn't even see you post that.

1727
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:00,340
I didn't even see you post that.

1728
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:04,680
No, I just like, you know, like say like any...

1729
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:05,960
Any...

1730
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:11,040
Any Vtubers that want to be in, just reply to my post and then I pick someone at random.

1731
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:12,660
I mean, it's not a huge thing.

1732
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,540
It's not like it's the greatest thing.

1733
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:18,080
You know, like it's just a small little game.

1734
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:21,980
But I figure, you know, it might be kind of fun for some people to be like...

1735
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:22,920
I'm in the game!

1736
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:24,960
I don't know.

1737
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:27,260
Maybe someone would want to be in it.

1738
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:36,600
So...

1739
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:37,220
Okay.

1740
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:38,580
Give me my anvil.

1741
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:42,340
Give me my anvil.

1742
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:46,260
Give... Where is my anvil?

1743
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:48,240
Give me my anvil.

1744
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:49,740
Where is...

1745
01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:49,860
Oh!

1746
01:45:58,160 --> 01:45:58,560
Money.

1747
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:00,440
Money, baby.

1748
01:46:09,820 --> 01:46:10,220
Wait.

1749
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:11,920
What is this one?

1750
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,120
This is collector stamp.

1751
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:17,760
If a target is defeated within 2 seconds after being hit by this weapon, they have a 1% chance to drop a stamp.

1752
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:19,620
But may drop a mushroom.

1753
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:23,220
What?

1754
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:25,000
Oh, it's already maxed.

1755
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:25,860
New stamp!

1756
01:46:29,910 --> 01:46:30,730
What's a mushroom?

1757
01:46:30,810 --> 01:46:31,830
What if they drop the mushroom?

1758
01:46:34,830 --> 01:46:35,710
Drop a mushroom!

1759
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:36,430
Drop a mushroom!

1760
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:41,240
There it is.

1761
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:46,200
Kinako?

1762
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:53,440
I got a meal!

1763
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:54,380
That's so crazy.

1764
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:56,260
Oh my gosh, they dropped a stamp!

1765
01:46:57,540 --> 01:46:58,880
Increase attack size.

1766
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:04,460
I want to see the other one.

1767
01:47:10,630 --> 01:47:11,270
Ow.

1768
01:47:12,170 --> 01:47:13,610
I'll just go with the Asakoko.

1769
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:22,660
Mint Phantom.

1770
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:31,640
That's my name.

1771
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:35,000
I thought you guys forgot about me.

1772
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:37,460
I thought you guys didn't like me anymore.

1773
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:43,500
I thought you guys forgot all about me.

1774
01:47:57,510 --> 01:47:59,450
I dreamt about you!

1775
01:47:59,450 --> 01:48:00,110
What?

1776
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:01,270
Was it a nightmare?

1777
01:48:02,470 --> 01:48:04,730
Was I in your walls?

1778
01:48:04,830 --> 01:48:05,970
Was I stalking you?

1779
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:22,000
What?

1780
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:22,740
What was that noise?

1781
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:36,140
I'm so scary, so every dream about me would be a nightmare instead, you know?

1782
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:42,020
I get to have another first victory.

1783
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:43,120
What do you mean?

1784
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:49,780
Cubic, thank you for the very specific pink.

1785
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:52,040
Thank you!

1786
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:04,740
We will never forget about you, Lilac.

1787
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:08,600
I'm having an identity crisis every day at this point.

1788
01:49:13,660 --> 01:49:17,040
I think I have identity crisis all the time now.

1789
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:19,820
I don't know if you guys like me or not.

1790
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:28,800
She was stuck in my bookshelf.

1791
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:30,940
What do you mean I was stuck in your bookshelf?

1792
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:43,970
I think I should...

1793
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:46,310
Golly gosh!

1794
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:46,590
Gosh!

1795
01:49:49,330 --> 01:49:50,970
I'm gonna die at this rate.

1796
01:49:51,370 --> 01:49:52,250
There we go.

1797
01:49:52,470 --> 01:49:53,950
Nevermind, I'm not gonna die.

1798
01:49:54,410 --> 01:49:55,270
Never die!

1799
01:49:57,810 --> 01:49:59,530
Do you actually think we don't like you?

1800
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:00,010
I don't know.

1801
01:50:01,210 --> 01:50:02,170
I'm insecure.

1802
01:50:02,870 --> 01:50:03,850
I'm insecure.

1803
01:50:04,690 --> 01:50:05,830
I know what for.

1804
01:50:12,110 --> 01:50:14,730
Wait, can I Asakoko...

1805
01:50:21,870 --> 01:50:23,450
We hate to love you.

1806
01:50:23,890 --> 01:50:25,150
We love to hate you.

1807
01:50:27,130 --> 01:50:29,150
We'll always love Flintstones.

1808
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:32,690
Flintstones, meet the Flintstones.

1809
01:50:33,310 --> 01:50:34,290
Nice attack style.

1810
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:38,710
Oh my gosh, my pickup is at 400.

1811
01:50:39,770 --> 01:50:42,410
We're so close to getting to 500.

1812
01:50:42,870 --> 01:50:45,010
Oh wait, I don't think I will here though, right?

1813
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:47,090
Because...

1814
01:50:49,180 --> 01:50:51,560
I don't think I will, because...

1815
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:55,000
I'm not doing endless.

1816
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:58,420
Grandad.

1817
01:50:59,860 --> 01:51:00,940
Welcome back, Mito!

1818
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:03,320
I can never forget about you, for better or for worse.

1819
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,540
Yeah, I'm haunting you.

1820
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:08,600
I have to haunt you more.

1821
01:51:08,940 --> 01:51:10,000
Oh yeah, the nightly milk.

1822
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:11,340
Let's see if we can re-roll for it.

1823
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:15,820
Re-roll!

1824
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:17,280
Re-roll!

1825
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:22,800
Re-roll!

1826
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:30,240
Re-roll!

1827
01:51:36,020 --> 01:51:38,180
I'll do it next time.

1828
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:42,800
We love you, maid channel.

1829
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:46,880
Oh yeah, I forgot I can eliminate stuff.

1830
01:51:55,530 --> 01:51:59,310
Maybe it would help because I'm taking a lot of damage, but...

1831
01:51:59,310 --> 01:52:00,950
At the same time...

1832
01:52:02,470 --> 01:52:03,450
I don't know.

1833
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:06,990
But plushie is new?

1834
01:52:07,130 --> 01:52:08,530
No, plushie is not new.

1835
01:52:09,350 --> 01:52:11,610
What can I do with the Asakoko?

1836
01:52:12,850 --> 01:52:14,370
Oh, I like it with the bomb.

1837
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,800
Oh, elimination had a bug?

1838
01:52:25,860 --> 01:52:26,380
I know, right?

1839
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:28,960
Before I streamed, there was another update.

1840
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:32,300
I said it fixed some stuff, so...

1841
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:33,960
Let's do...

1842
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:35,720
Let's just do spider cooking.

1843
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:38,300
Extra stenchy.

1844
01:52:38,980 --> 01:52:39,960
Extra stink.

1845
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:43,960
The smell of a hag...

1846
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:47,420
Permeates in all ways.

1847
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:49,780
Thank you for the superchat!

1848
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:52,080
Thank you, Sat.

1849
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:56,000
Haunt me more!

1850
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:02,080
Oh my gosh, couple, your profile picture is sad gengar.

1851
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:06,480
Stinky stink stink stink stink.

1852
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:08,680
We'll get it naturally, maybe.

1853
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:14,840
Oh yeah, that's right, I have the dash.

1854
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:16,680
Wait, I'm gonna try using it.

1855
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,620
Oh, oh, oh, god.

1856
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:25,140
I went right into them.

1857
01:53:29,070 --> 01:53:33,870
My friend has me saved in his phone as Ash's lost hot dog gacha.

1858
01:53:34,170 --> 01:53:35,590
What the hell, that's so mean!

1859
01:53:39,790 --> 01:53:41,530
So please let me win this time.

1860
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:43,330
Oh, I actually don't know what you got.

1861
01:53:46,470 --> 01:53:48,610
Why can't I get the nightly milk?

1862
01:53:54,690 --> 01:53:56,670
Oh, you got the hot dog, let's go.

1863
01:54:02,250 --> 01:54:07,890
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1864
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:16,670
Once I'm done with this stage, I'll go get my perfume.

1865
01:54:17,450 --> 01:54:18,170
Matara's perfume.

1866
01:54:19,870 --> 01:54:21,070
For you guys.

1867
01:54:21,890 --> 01:54:24,190
I'm keeping, I'm just thinking about...

1868
01:54:24,990 --> 01:54:25,750
Smells now.

1869
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:30,050
I've never, I've never, I'll be honest.

1870
01:54:30,130 --> 01:54:33,650
I've never been brave enough to get one of those, like...

1871
01:54:34,710 --> 01:54:39,470
This is the scent of an OL type things, you know?

1872
01:54:39,590 --> 01:54:41,310
I've never been brave enough to get one.

1873
01:54:41,410 --> 01:54:45,770
But maybe next time I go to Japan, I will go to M's and I'll buy some.

1874
01:54:45,830 --> 01:54:49,070
And then I can bring some and then I will review them on stream.

1875
01:54:54,510 --> 01:54:55,970
I wonder if it's a classy perfume.

1876
01:54:56,210 --> 01:54:56,890
I don't know.

1877
01:55:01,090 --> 01:55:02,410
My next merch?

1878
01:55:02,410 --> 01:55:03,010
But

1879
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:11,920
don't you already smell like OL?

1880
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,400
No, there's like several of them, right?

1881
01:55:15,540 --> 01:55:17,220
It'll be like...

1882
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:19,000
This is the smell of...

1883
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:22,600
Of...

1884
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:24,000
I don't...

1885
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:28,880
Scratch and sniff Ducky Makura.

1886
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:33,440
Should I tell them to include a scratch and sniff with all Ducky Makura pre-orders now?

1887
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,300
Minto in 4D.

1888
01:55:36,860 --> 01:55:37,900
Oh my gosh.

1889
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:40,300
They used to do that with the...

1890
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:42,720
On the TV shows and stuff.

1891
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:44,100
But they always smelled terrible.

1892
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:47,800
It would be like, scratch and sniff right now!

1893
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:49,440
And it would smell like actual feet.

1894
01:55:56,540 --> 01:55:57,600
What do I have?

1895
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:01,300
This is like the worst setup I've ever had.

1896
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:03,420
Reroll, reroll.

1897
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:10,280
You guys know how I did the HALU before?

1898
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:13,300
I... So basically, I got to...

1899
01:56:14,020 --> 01:56:15,940
What is... There's an achievement, right?

1900
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:18,400
For finishing with HALU level 5.

1901
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:21,460
I did it up to level 4 and then like...

1902
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:25,340
Like with like 10 seconds left, I went up to HALU 5.

1903
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:26,520
And I got the achievement.

1904
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:28,420
I think I did.

1905
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:36,620
That's how I did it.

1906
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:40,520
Sneaky.

1907
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:41,240
Sneaky.

1908
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:44,520
Okay.

1909
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:46,900
We'll do it.

1910
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:47,480
Grab it.

1911
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:48,740
More money, more money.

1912
01:56:49,620 --> 01:56:51,900
More money, more problems.

1913
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:54,620
Because I'll be going back...

1914
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:57,380
Into the casino.

1915
01:56:57,380 --> 01:56:57,620
No.

1916
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,640
Give me nightly milk, please.

1917
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:11,780
Oh my gosh, they're so tough.

1918
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:15,340
I need more haste, honestly.

1919
01:57:16,780 --> 01:57:17,880
More money.

1920
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:21,700
I love how HALU 5 is just please stop.

1921
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:25,520
Okay, I'm gonna eliminate... Oh gosh.

1922
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:28,040
Oh wait.

1923
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:29,380
Oh, but this will...

1924
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:34,060
Okay, let's just grab the elite lava bucket.

1925
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:35,580
We'll collab these two.

1926
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:44,960
They're all getting so close to me.

1927
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:50,540
Why won't you guys die already?

1928
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:54,680
Give me my boxes, please.

1929
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:57,340
Oh.

1930
01:57:57,580 --> 01:57:58,880
Oh, I just got an onion.

1931
01:57:59,260 --> 01:57:59,640
Nice.

1932
01:58:02,900 --> 01:58:04,560
I think I should take this nurse's horn.

1933
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:06,640
With the way I'm playing today.

1934
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:08,500
I'm not paying attention at all.

1935
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:12,640
Maybe I shouldn't have picked such a...

1936
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:16,020
Focus... Needs my focus game...

1937
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:17,820
For the first time I'm streaming since...

1938
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:18,800
Money!

1939
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:24,020
Money!

1940
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:24,620
Give me the money.

1941
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:25,400
Give me the money.

1942
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:31,560
Smell accurate minto ducky feet?

1943
01:58:36,230 --> 01:58:38,070
Tuna, you're a feet man.

1944
01:58:39,630 --> 01:58:40,050
Really?

1945
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:45,750
Oh my god.

1946
01:58:46,170 --> 01:58:47,290
Go away from my place.

1947
01:58:47,590 --> 01:58:48,350
I'm trapped.

1948
01:58:48,470 --> 01:58:48,790
I'm trapped.

1949
01:58:58,040 --> 01:58:59,200
Oh, my box.

1950
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:01,360
Okay, we'll take that.

1951
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:07,020
I don't think I'm gonna be able to finish any of these, but...

1952
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:07,920
No, my box!

1953
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:10,000
No, my double box!

1954
01:59:13,700 --> 01:59:14,500
Stay away.

1955
01:59:14,820 --> 01:59:15,900
I gotta get over there, please.

1956
01:59:17,460 --> 01:59:17,860
Please.

1957
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:18,260
Please.

1958
01:59:18,380 --> 01:59:20,820
I'm gonna die because you guys are on top of me.

1959
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:22,720
Yippee!

1960
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:26,620
I want to get 500.

1961
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:31,100
Phantom Thief concert next month?

1962
01:59:31,140 --> 01:59:31,460
Can't wait.

1963
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:32,280
Thank you!

1964
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:36,740
Not the self-report.

1965
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:37,460
Don't shame?

1966
01:59:37,580 --> 01:59:38,160
I'm not.

1967
01:59:38,360 --> 01:59:39,140
I'm just...

1968
01:59:39,140 --> 01:59:40,940
I'm just surprised.

1969
01:59:42,740 --> 01:59:44,120
I'm glad that we are...

1970
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:46,440
Well, sometimes I think we're a little too comfortable.

1971
01:59:47,160 --> 01:59:50,260
I'm happy that you're comfortable enough with confiding in me...

1972
01:59:50,260 --> 01:59:51,800
how you feel about things.

1973
01:59:52,980 --> 01:59:53,380
You know?

1974
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:02,620
We're a community...

1975
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:04,440
of freaks.

1976
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:10,040
I'm gonna drop it for now.

1977
02:00:11,380 --> 02:00:13,380
I need to heal first.

1978
02:00:14,580 --> 02:00:15,640
Oh, my gosh.

1979
02:00:17,060 --> 02:00:18,060
Okay, I'm in.

1980
02:00:24,820 --> 02:00:26,300
Nightly milk!

1981
02:00:27,460 --> 02:00:29,320
Come home, please.

1982
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:30,820
Oh, please.

1983
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:33,540
I'm just thirsty for some milk.

1984
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:41,700
Some big tall glass of milk would be mighty fine right now.

1985
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:44,280
Gosh, if it's of the night variety.

1986
02:00:46,280 --> 02:00:47,880
Oh, I'm so thirsty.

1987
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:48,720
Please.

1988
02:00:49,480 --> 02:00:55,720
Won't any knights open their bosoms for a desperate little ghost?

1989
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:57,200
I'm turning into a wisp.

1990
02:00:57,200 --> 02:00:58,520
I'm losing so much energy.

1991
02:00:58,640 --> 02:00:59,720
I'm so thirsty.

1992
02:01:01,660 --> 02:01:02,480
Dang it.

1993
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:09,320
Imagine if people had feet like birds.

1994
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:10,760
Would we wear shoes?

1995
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:12,540
I don't think so.

1996
02:01:18,430 --> 02:01:19,970
I'm gonna re-roll.

1997
02:01:20,730 --> 02:01:21,410
Oh, come on.

1998
02:01:25,990 --> 02:01:27,530
I don't wanna die.

1999
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:33,640
Please.

2000
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:39,320
Oh, I got a koi fish.

2001
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:40,380
So cute.

2002
02:01:41,860 --> 02:01:42,800
Oh, a carrot.

2003
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:43,620
I got a carrot.

2004
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:45,260
Let's go.

2005
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:49,000
Oh, my god.

2006
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:49,860
Hoshiyomi, please.

2007
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:55,260
Guys, I don't think I'm getting this.

2008
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,040
You are already dead.

2009
02:01:58,600 --> 02:01:58,960
True.

2010
02:02:05,010 --> 02:02:07,090
Isn't there a minotaur farm around here?

2011
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:16,420
I don't wanna think about it.

2012
02:02:21,510 --> 02:02:26,110
I know I gotta get kind of close, but then they just pile on top of me.

2013
02:02:28,350 --> 02:02:29,470
It's so scary.

2014
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:39,080
If my haste was higher, it'd be better, because then I'd be like...

2015
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:40,240
Oh, my god.

2016
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:41,040
I did not notice.

2017
02:02:41,380 --> 02:02:42,060
Oh, my god.

2018
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:43,080
I did not notice the...

2019
02:02:44,340 --> 02:02:45,200
Oh, my god.

2020
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:47,100
Oh, my gosh.

2021
02:02:47,100 --> 02:02:47,960
I was losing health.

2022
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:48,800
I don't even know.

2023
02:02:51,940 --> 02:02:52,280
Yeah!

2024
02:02:58,110 --> 02:02:59,830
She likes Toho, so she probably...

2025
02:02:59,830 --> 02:03:00,050
What?

2026
02:03:00,130 --> 02:03:01,170
What are you saying about me?

2027
02:03:02,610 --> 02:03:03,790
What are you saying about me?

2028
02:03:04,110 --> 02:03:06,890
Asking... Would asking for scent of armpit be too DJ?

2029
02:03:07,770 --> 02:03:09,450
I'm asking for me.

2030
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:24,340
Oh,

2031
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:30,860
my god.

2032
02:03:30,980 --> 02:03:31,300
Oh,

2033
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:39,050
my god.

2034
02:03:39,190 --> 02:03:41,810
I got stuck on something.

2035
02:03:42,430 --> 02:03:43,370
I don't know why.

2036
02:03:47,150 --> 02:03:48,710
The armpit did this.

2037
02:03:50,250 --> 02:03:52,310
So freaky, it ended the run.

2038
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:02,120
Oh, man.

2039
02:04:05,460 --> 02:04:05,940
Anyway...

2040
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:07,780
Oh, my god.

2041
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:14,820
Not an easy game to play and retry.

2042
02:04:15,060 --> 02:04:16,500
I know, but that's all good.

2043
02:04:18,220 --> 02:04:20,380
That's why I played so much off-stream.

2044
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:22,780
Kaichou time or peko time?

2045
02:04:23,320 --> 02:04:25,300
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.

2046
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:27,340
Catch a peko by his toe.

2047
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:29,320
If he pekos, let him go.

2048
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:35,240
My mama said to pick the very best one.

2049
02:04:35,660 --> 02:04:37,480
And you are it.

2050
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:38,020
Peko!

2051
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:40,120
Except it's Coco.

2052
02:04:43,090 --> 02:04:44,040
We'll do the same.

2053
02:04:44,100 --> 02:04:45,300
We'll do the same...

2054
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:46,720
Same place.

2055
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:49,760
So she's just got a little slash.

2056
02:04:50,220 --> 02:04:52,580
Mari's Toho album with Kool & Create was my...

2057
02:04:52,580 --> 02:04:54,240
Was the first VTuber merch I bought.

2058
02:04:55,860 --> 02:04:58,320
Her version of Help Me Eddy was so good.

2059
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:00,760
Yeah.

2060
02:05:01,780 --> 02:05:03,540
I was thinking about her...

2061
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:06,040
Her Toho album this past weekend, actually.

2062
02:05:06,260 --> 02:05:07,360
Super Teto time!

2063
02:05:09,620 --> 02:05:12,300
Even if I die, I always think of the money first.

2064
02:05:14,100 --> 02:05:14,620
Guys...

2065
02:05:14,620 --> 02:05:16,380
In games, I'm greedy, okay?

2066
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:17,900
Actually, I'm also greedy.

2067
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:20,520
You guys, I think I've realized this.

2068
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:23,320
This... I think...

2069
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:25,880
I think I... That's what I realized.

2070
02:05:25,980 --> 02:05:26,760
I think I'm...

2071
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:28,060
I think I'm...

2072
02:05:28,060 --> 02:05:29,340
Maybe too greedy.

2073
02:05:42,470 --> 02:05:45,270
But not just for money.

2074
02:05:48,430 --> 02:05:50,510
She finally realized.

2075
02:05:50,690 --> 02:05:51,550
What do you mean?

2076
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:04,420
I think I'm just greedy.

2077
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:14,720
I hate this feeling.

2078
02:06:26,050 --> 02:06:28,630
Thank you for the 20 gifts!

2079
02:06:28,750 --> 02:06:29,890
Thank you!

2080
02:06:32,090 --> 02:06:33,930
By the way, happy Friday everybody.

2081
02:06:34,470 --> 02:06:35,690
Money for Metal Gear merch.

2082
02:06:35,810 --> 02:06:36,050
Stop!

2083
02:06:36,750 --> 02:06:39,110
I bought the cushions today.

2084
02:06:42,150 --> 02:06:44,110
You're greedy for our love and attention.

2085
02:07:15,010 --> 02:07:15,910
No, leave me!

2086
02:07:19,930 --> 02:07:21,170
Greed is sin, Minto.

2087
02:07:21,390 --> 02:07:21,830
I know.

2088
02:07:22,290 --> 02:07:23,110
I'm a sinner.

2089
02:07:23,110 --> 02:07:23,250
I'm a sinner.

2090
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:32,280
Grab it anyway.

2091
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:36,940
Actually, it might actually be good for Coco.

2092
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:39,140
Give me the box.

2093
02:07:45,660 --> 02:07:48,720
Special attack action can execute other attacks.

2094
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:52,500
When the special gauge is at 50%.

2095
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:53,140
Huh?

2096
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:53,640
Wait.

2097
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:56,160
What is that?

2098
02:07:56,680 --> 02:07:57,520
Wait, what is that?

2099
02:07:57,520 --> 02:07:59,040
No, no, no.

2100
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:00,320
What is this?

2101
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:06,540
What the...

2102
02:08:06,540 --> 02:08:09,000
Oh, it's a fan letter!

2103
02:08:09,620 --> 02:08:10,600
Oh my god!

2104
02:08:13,730 --> 02:08:16,050
I'll get the limiter and then we'll get the dragon.

2105
02:08:17,810 --> 02:08:19,350
I've never seen one.

2106
02:08:21,270 --> 02:08:22,590
Oh, I got some wood.

2107
02:08:29,590 --> 02:08:32,090
Greedy for our love, but we won't marry you.

2108
02:08:32,090 --> 02:08:33,530
That's fine.

2109
02:08:36,510 --> 02:08:37,510
That's fine.

2110
02:08:37,950 --> 02:08:38,730
We're homies.

2111
02:08:39,610 --> 02:08:40,610
It's fine.

2112
02:08:41,490 --> 02:08:44,570
Oh wait, if a target takes damage within the first 5 seconds after spawning...

2113
02:08:44,570 --> 02:08:48,250
They take 1.10 damage.

2114
02:08:48,410 --> 02:08:49,850
All Asakoko weapons have...

2115
02:08:50,470 --> 02:08:51,610
Life... Wait, there's more.

2116
02:08:52,130 --> 02:08:53,350
Life steal, 5%.

2117
02:08:54,250 --> 02:08:56,850
Asakoko's negative effects are negated.

2118
02:08:59,270 --> 02:09:01,850
So even the Asakoko medicine...

2119
02:09:02,990 --> 02:09:04,770
That I don't think I've ever used once.

2120
02:09:11,650 --> 02:09:12,210
Maybe...

2121
02:09:12,850 --> 02:09:13,150
Yay!

2122
02:09:14,570 --> 02:09:15,130
RGB!

2123
02:09:16,850 --> 02:09:19,530
Oh my gosh, it looks so pretty with her weapon.

2124
02:09:21,950 --> 02:09:23,890
Are you saying you wouldn't marry a bro?

2125
02:09:23,890 --> 02:09:27,390
If we had...

2126
02:09:27,390 --> 02:09:29,450
If we had to, maybe.

2127
02:09:30,130 --> 02:09:30,650
I don't know.

2128
02:09:31,610 --> 02:09:33,130
Stop asking me hard questions.

2129
02:09:33,310 --> 02:09:33,930
I'm gonna special!

2130
02:09:37,150 --> 02:09:37,790
That

2131
02:09:45,970 --> 02:09:46,890
was fun.

2132
02:09:47,810 --> 02:09:49,670
I marry and then I divorce later.

2133
02:09:53,310 --> 02:09:55,290
This is why you signed the prenup.

2134
02:09:57,910 --> 02:09:59,270
This is why...

2135
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:03,110
The best homies marry their homies.

2136
02:10:03,570 --> 02:10:05,690
Oh I can... Targets may become marked.

2137
02:10:08,650 --> 02:10:09,770
Get marked!

2138
02:10:09,950 --> 02:10:10,590
Get marked!

2139
02:10:11,630 --> 02:10:12,690
Get marked!

2140
02:10:12,850 --> 02:10:13,390
Get marked!

2141
02:10:16,910 --> 02:10:17,850
Get marked!

2142
02:10:18,150 --> 02:10:18,550
Get marked!

2143
02:10:19,230 --> 02:10:21,690
I would marry you even if you were RGB.

2144
02:10:22,730 --> 02:10:24,150
Why do they have a tan?

2145
02:10:27,170 --> 02:10:28,650
Oh, it's from me.

2146
02:10:30,210 --> 02:10:31,830
Oh, no, strengthen.

2147
02:10:32,070 --> 02:10:32,490
There we go.

2148
02:10:39,290 --> 02:10:40,170
That's the meta.

2149
02:10:44,010 --> 02:10:45,170
I love RGB.

2150
02:10:49,370 --> 02:10:52,070
I'm glad I'm not a dog and I can see in color.

2151
02:10:53,330 --> 02:10:53,810
Yay!

2152
02:10:54,090 --> 02:10:56,770
For not being a... I got that dog in me though.

2153
02:10:57,250 --> 02:10:59,790
I'm not a dog, but I am a dog.

2154
02:11:00,030 --> 02:11:00,690
You know what I mean?

2155
02:11:09,980 --> 02:11:11,140
Super chat time!

2156
02:11:13,140 --> 02:11:15,100
I got that dog in me.

2157
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:18,620
But I'm not a dog.

2158
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:20,640
I'm just a... I'm a dog.

2159
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:21,640
You know?

2160
02:11:24,120 --> 02:11:24,940
Sup dog.

2161
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:28,620
Oh, wait.

2162
02:11:31,900 --> 02:11:33,100
Sup dog!

2163
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:34,180
Sup dog!

2164
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:34,580
Wait.

2165
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:39,280
What's dog?

2166
02:11:39,460 --> 02:11:39,640
Wait.

2167
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:41,500
What's dog?

2168
02:11:43,360 --> 02:11:44,540
What's dog?

2169
02:11:44,900 --> 02:11:45,480
What's dog?

2170
02:11:47,200 --> 02:11:48,300
What's dog?

2171
02:11:59,350 --> 02:12:00,070
Wait.

2172
02:12:02,450 --> 02:12:03,630
What's up dog?

2173
02:12:03,770 --> 02:12:04,630
What's up dog?

2174
02:12:06,010 --> 02:12:07,230
What's up dog?

2175
02:12:07,310 --> 02:12:08,070
What's up dog?

2176
02:12:08,670 --> 02:12:09,990
What's up dog?

2177
02:12:10,430 --> 02:12:11,250
What's up dog?

2178
02:12:18,900 --> 02:12:19,620
Wait.

2179
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:27,300
No,

2180
02:12:33,570 --> 02:12:34,150
wait...

2181
02:12:39,050 --> 02:12:41,630
What is... Wait...

2182
02:12:45,410 --> 02:12:47,910
What's up dog... No, that's the same thing I've been saying.

2183
02:12:49,610 --> 02:12:51,330
I'm asking the question though.

2184
02:12:53,150 --> 02:12:53,730
Wait...

2185
02:13:00,850 --> 02:13:02,710
Do you know up dog?

2186
02:13:20,380 --> 02:13:21,760
No, what's up dog?

2187
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:24,000
Yeah, what's up with you?

2188
02:13:33,460 --> 02:13:34,420
It's confusing.

2189
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:38,620
You know what I was trying to ask though.

2190
02:13:57,830 --> 02:14:01,790
It means what is up... Yeah, but I'm asking... I was asking you...

2191
02:14:01,790 --> 02:14:03,550
You were supposed to... I'm supposed to say...

2192
02:14:03,550 --> 02:14:04,690
What is up dog?

2193
02:14:04,710 --> 02:14:05,910
And you're supposed to say...

2194
02:14:05,910 --> 02:14:07,050
What's up dog?

2195
02:14:07,050 --> 02:14:09,990
And then... Like, because you don't know...

2196
02:14:09,990 --> 02:14:12,510
And then I say...

2197
02:14:13,050 --> 02:14:14,830
Then I say...

2198
02:14:14,830 --> 02:14:17,050
Nothing, you...

2199
02:14:29,400 --> 02:14:30,280
You what?

2200
02:14:30,940 --> 02:14:31,180
Huh?

2201
02:14:32,420 --> 02:14:32,980
Wait...

2202
02:14:33,600 --> 02:14:36,700
That's not right, but that's literally what I just did.

2203
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:46,580
I asked the question and you say what is it and then I answer.

2204
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:51,020
You guys just don't understand the joke.

2205
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:54,000
You guys are a little confused.

2206
02:14:54,820 --> 02:14:58,380
So... What's... What's... What's dog... Wait...

2207
02:14:58,380 --> 02:15:03,480
What's up dog is like a term that when you are asking someone...

2208
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:07,880
It's like a casual way of asking someone how are they doing.

2209
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,070
And so it's like a...

2210
02:15:15,250 --> 02:15:21,070
Then you ask them what that is and they say I don't know what that is and then you say...

2211
02:15:21,690 --> 02:15:23,350
Yeah, that... How are you doing?

2212
02:15:25,230 --> 02:15:28,250
But you're asking as a joke.

2213
02:15:29,070 --> 02:15:30,970
You don't really care about how they're doing.

2214
02:15:30,970 --> 02:15:31,090
What do you think?

2215
02:15:58,070 --> 02:15:58,550
Why?

2216
02:16:03,270 --> 02:16:03,750
Why?

2217
02:16:03,890 --> 02:16:04,950
Let me get my box.

2218
02:16:05,910 --> 02:16:07,010
I dropped the toilet.

2219
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:10,740
Cool fact.

2220
02:16:10,860 --> 02:16:12,300
Anyway, have you heard of up dog?

2221
02:16:17,150 --> 02:16:21,310
Would you have a up dog or a matter baby?

2222
02:16:22,190 --> 02:16:25,560
I love the...

2223
02:16:25,560 --> 02:16:27,060
Let's take the EN's curse.

2224
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:28,100
Oh my gosh.

2225
02:16:28,200 --> 02:16:28,700
Oh my gosh.

2226
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:30,380
I'm dropping everything.

2227
02:16:31,580 --> 02:16:33,640
I don't really understand this one, I think.

2228
02:16:34,760 --> 02:16:35,480
Wait, hold on.

2229
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:37,280
My chat is stupid.

2230
02:16:37,460 --> 02:16:37,980
Hold on one second.

2231
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:38,840
Not you guys.

2232
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:39,460
You're not stupid.

2233
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:42,060
YouTube chat froze so it's being stupid.

2234
02:16:43,860 --> 02:16:45,360
I didn't call you stupid, okay?

2235
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:50,200
Uh-oh, YouTube froze.

2236
02:17:00,010 --> 02:17:01,290
One second.

2237
02:17:06,570 --> 02:17:07,950
I'm bringing you back.

2238
02:17:10,510 --> 02:17:14,150
Viewers are reacting to a streamer named Minto's joke about what's a matter baby.

2239
02:17:21,820 --> 02:17:25,320
Oh my god, there should be a Vtuber named matter baby.

2240
02:17:26,780 --> 02:17:29,400
It's just like... And then people are like, who's matter baby?

2241
02:17:30,220 --> 02:17:32,740
You're just like, what's a matter with you?

2242
02:17:38,670 --> 02:17:39,710
Why the...

2243
02:17:40,330 --> 02:17:40,850
Da...

2244
02:17:41,710 --> 02:17:42,230
Dash...

2245
02:17:42,230 --> 02:17:44,290
Oh, I don't know how to say that dog's name.

2246
02:17:45,050 --> 02:17:46,050
The dash...

2247
02:17:47,130 --> 02:17:48,630
Sit in the shade.

2248
02:17:49,070 --> 02:17:50,070
It was a hot dog.

2249
02:17:59,980 --> 02:18:00,780
Wiener dog.

2250
02:18:02,460 --> 02:18:03,460
What's up, baby?

2251
02:18:04,460 --> 02:18:06,120
Don't call me baby!

2252
02:18:08,300 --> 02:18:09,520
Don't call me baby!

2253
02:18:11,060 --> 02:18:13,580
Zoomers have come up with the term...

2254
02:18:14,620 --> 02:18:15,540
Eyeladies.

2255
02:18:20,810 --> 02:18:21,730
Eyeladies?

2256
02:18:24,150 --> 02:18:25,070
Docsun.

2257
02:18:25,210 --> 02:18:25,470
Oh!

2258
02:18:34,890 --> 02:18:36,450
I don't get it.

2259
02:18:36,870 --> 02:18:37,750
Eyeladies.

2260
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:46,760
If I say, what's eyeladies?

2261
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:48,580
You say, what's a lady?

2262
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:49,900
I am a lady.

2263
02:18:54,220 --> 02:18:56,740
Oh my gosh, too much katakana for me to read.

2264
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:58,460
Thank you very much.

2265
02:19:11,620 --> 02:19:13,020
What's eyeladies with you?

2266
02:19:16,670 --> 02:19:18,370
Is this supposed to be a dumb joke?

2267
02:19:24,890 --> 02:19:27,030
Is that what the new...

2268
02:19:27,030 --> 02:19:27,790
What's it called?

2269
02:19:27,910 --> 02:19:28,550
Oh my gosh.

2270
02:19:28,830 --> 02:19:31,110
Next iPhone will be called the Eyeladies.

2271
02:19:33,790 --> 02:19:35,050
That's what the...

2272
02:19:35,050 --> 02:19:39,450
You know how they say by 2025 more people will be having sex with robots?

2273
02:19:41,150 --> 02:19:41,710
Eyeladies.

2274
02:19:44,610 --> 02:19:47,950
Would you say you smell of up dog?

2275
02:19:49,650 --> 02:19:50,110
No.

2276
02:19:52,770 --> 02:19:54,270
You're saying I smell...Oh no!

2277
02:19:54,310 --> 02:19:55,390
I forgot to get the Asa Coco!

2278
02:19:56,350 --> 02:19:58,190
Are you saying I smell like a dog?

2279
02:19:59,190 --> 02:20:00,650
Are you saying I smell like a...

2280
02:20:01,350 --> 02:20:02,350
Where is my...

2281
02:20:02,950 --> 02:20:05,170
Are you saying I smell like a dog?

2282
02:20:14,810 --> 02:20:15,890
Kinda messed up.

2283
02:20:19,980 --> 02:20:23,660
I hate playing Asa Coco, but I'm also kinda just bad.

2284
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:25,400
But I'm also barely paying attention.

2285
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:27,980
Hey, leave me alone!

2286
02:20:28,620 --> 02:20:29,680
Oh, my box.

2287
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:30,780
Hold on, I gotta get my box.

2288
02:20:35,910 --> 02:20:37,910
Who's doing research on robot sex anyway?

2289
02:20:38,190 --> 02:20:38,950
Who is it?

2290
02:20:40,070 --> 02:20:41,370
I'm just gonna get out of here.

2291
02:20:43,470 --> 02:20:44,590
I'm gonna get out of here.

2292
02:20:52,990 --> 02:20:56,410
Oh my god, please.

2293
02:20:56,610 --> 02:20:56,890
Burger?

2294
02:20:58,150 --> 02:20:58,970
Any burgers?

2295
02:21:00,150 --> 02:21:01,430
Any hamburgers around?

2296
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:08,540
Guys, I'm so sore from my trip.

2297
02:21:10,180 --> 02:21:12,980
I could barely move this morning.

2298
02:21:13,240 --> 02:21:14,440
I'm so sore.

2299
02:21:15,060 --> 02:21:17,240
I think we danced too much.

2300
02:21:18,020 --> 02:21:19,120
All the dancing.

2301
02:21:19,460 --> 02:21:20,080
I know.

2302
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:28,260
Oh my gosh, but I think it's pretty committed to ectoplasm memory now though, so...

2303
02:21:28,260 --> 02:21:29,360
I think I'll be okay.

2304
02:21:29,820 --> 02:21:30,540
Flower!

2305
02:21:31,060 --> 02:21:31,460
Flower.

2306
02:21:34,040 --> 02:21:35,800
Oh my god, am I actually gonna die?

2307
02:21:36,020 --> 02:21:37,340
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

2308
02:21:40,540 --> 02:21:42,180
I can't die like this.

2309
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:47,080
Flower.

2310
02:21:50,660 --> 02:21:51,600
Remember to dash.

2311
02:21:51,700 --> 02:21:54,200
Oh yeah, I keep forgetting that I even have this ability.

2312
02:21:57,360 --> 02:21:59,020
Wait, so if I dash...

2313
02:21:59,020 --> 02:22:00,720
Oh, wait, it only...

2314
02:22:00,720 --> 02:22:02,900
Okay, interesting.

2315
02:22:03,240 --> 02:22:04,820
It doesn't go the direction I'm facing.

2316
02:22:05,580 --> 02:22:06,960
I understand.

2317
02:22:08,340 --> 02:22:09,460
Anybody, any...

2318
02:22:11,100 --> 02:22:12,220
Any hamburgers?

2319
02:22:14,540 --> 02:22:17,060
If I had a daughter, she'd be named Shannon.

2320
02:22:18,100 --> 02:22:20,060
Okay, that's a pretty average name.

2321
02:22:20,980 --> 02:22:22,440
Why did you say that to me?

2322
02:22:28,910 --> 02:22:31,010
When people see her, they'll say...

2323
02:22:31,010 --> 02:22:33,470
Oh hey, it's Shannon again.

2324
02:22:34,210 --> 02:22:37,910
Oh, like shenanigan.

2325
02:22:43,170 --> 02:22:46,390
Oh, Shannon and all her shenanigans.

2326
02:22:47,810 --> 02:22:50,630
Die, die, die, die.

2327
02:22:50,690 --> 02:22:51,710
I think I gotta get out of here.

2328
02:23:01,720 --> 02:23:03,580
Oh, my health is all back to normal.

2329
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:04,620
Yippee!

2330
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:07,280
These are nuts.

2331
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:07,900
None!

2332
02:23:09,140 --> 02:23:10,600
Still, don't talk like that.

2333
02:23:10,820 --> 02:23:12,500
You guys are teaching non-bad things.

2334
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,260
I want non to only send me superchats about Ace Combat.

2335
02:23:23,260 --> 02:23:24,940
Don't teach him bad things!

2336
02:23:29,610 --> 02:23:31,050
Thank you for the 5 gifted.

2337
02:23:38,070 --> 02:23:39,170
Rikyu, welcome.

2338
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:42,290
Rikyu's bald and I can be too.

2339
02:23:43,410 --> 02:23:44,210
Welcome to membership.

2340
02:23:52,300 --> 02:23:54,440
We're not well, are we everybody?

2341
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:56,520
Oh gosh, oh gosh!

2342
02:23:58,240 --> 02:23:59,220
Guys, I'm in trouble.

2343
02:24:00,060 --> 02:24:01,600
Guys, I'm in trouble for real.

2344
02:24:01,740 --> 02:24:02,620
Oh, oh god.

2345
02:24:02,780 --> 02:24:03,800
Guys, I'm in trouble.

2346
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:06,160
Why am I so bad at this game?

2347
02:24:09,620 --> 02:24:11,480
I'm so bad at this game, everybody.

2348
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:15,280
I think we're gonna die for real.

2349
02:24:16,900 --> 02:24:17,640
Oh my god.

2350
02:24:18,040 --> 02:24:18,580
Peko, peko!

2351
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:21,680
Swap.

2352
02:24:23,080 --> 02:24:24,340
You are not locked in.

2353
02:24:24,400 --> 02:24:25,260
I really am not.

2354
02:24:25,340 --> 02:24:25,680
Sorry.

2355
02:24:26,080 --> 02:24:29,040
I really am not locked in today.

2356
02:24:29,460 --> 02:24:30,540
I just got...

2357
02:24:36,450 --> 02:24:38,110
I should have dashed.

2358
02:24:38,370 --> 02:24:38,810
It's OK.

2359
02:24:39,930 --> 02:24:43,050
We're getting a little sample of... I didn't even make it to 10 minutes.

2360
02:24:44,630 --> 02:24:46,270
We're getting a sample of everybody.

2361
02:24:47,130 --> 02:24:48,210
We're getting a sample.

2362
02:24:58,790 --> 02:25:01,690
OK, I wish I was... Can I change it from control?

2363
02:25:04,110 --> 02:25:05,770
She launches missiles?

2364
02:25:06,810 --> 02:25:08,510
Oh boy, oh boy.

2365
02:25:08,690 --> 02:25:08,890
OK.

2366
02:25:11,490 --> 02:25:12,930
I'll save those for later.

2367
02:25:17,050 --> 02:25:17,650
Crap.

2368
02:25:18,950 --> 02:25:20,170
You can remind it?

2369
02:25:20,230 --> 02:25:20,650
OK, I will.

2370
02:25:20,730 --> 02:25:22,930
Every 15 seconds, roll a... Yeah!

2371
02:25:23,970 --> 02:25:24,930
Oh my gosh.

2372
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:30,060
How much did I get?

2373
02:25:32,280 --> 02:25:34,500
I'm not good with such aiming.

2374
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:36,320
Pyromaniac.

2375
02:25:36,840 --> 02:25:37,740
Oh yeah.

2376
02:25:38,740 --> 02:25:39,900
More explosion.

2377
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:51,360
Peko, peko, peko.

2378
02:25:52,280 --> 02:25:53,780
I'm starting to think that you're cute.

2379
02:25:56,860 --> 02:26:00,660
That is a side effect of the Minto virus.

2380
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:10,240
Nice combat tastes nice.

2381
02:26:10,820 --> 02:26:13,720
How much

2382
02:26:19,020 --> 02:26:19,960
money can I make?

2383
02:26:21,240 --> 02:26:21,660
Money!

2384
02:26:28,040 --> 02:26:28,880
Money!

2385
02:26:32,640 --> 02:26:33,900
Minto cute.

2386
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:38,140
Oh my God.

2387
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:38,540
Oh my God.

2388
02:26:38,600 --> 02:26:39,320
I didn't even notice.

2389
02:26:40,320 --> 02:26:40,920
Increase.

2390
02:26:41,700 --> 02:26:42,500
Increase.

2391
02:26:43,180 --> 02:26:43,960
Increase.

2392
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:46,380
Let me get to my stuff.

2393
02:26:47,420 --> 02:26:51,780
All weapons have a 10% chance to gain 20% size.

2394
02:26:52,280 --> 02:26:54,980
Gain stacks of luck that is equal to half of... Oh no.

2395
02:26:55,580 --> 02:26:57,520
Pekora is all about luck, you guys.

2396
02:26:59,060 --> 02:27:00,800
This is my...

2397
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:02,500
I'll never make it.

2398
02:27:03,860 --> 02:27:06,680
If Pekora is all about luck, I'll never make it.

2399
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:08,620
I'll never make it out alive.

2400
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:13,360
Minto virus.

2401
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:17,000
Yeah, you're already infected.

2402
02:27:19,380 --> 02:27:20,900
You're already infected.

2403
02:27:22,220 --> 02:27:22,960
It's okay.

2404
02:27:25,180 --> 02:27:26,580
There is no cure.

2405
02:27:28,540 --> 02:27:29,960
But it is fun.

2406
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:34,940
Keep getting the rocket launcher.

2407
02:27:35,100 --> 02:27:35,620
Nice!

2408
02:27:35,720 --> 02:27:37,080
We keep winning lots of money.

2409
02:27:37,080 --> 02:27:39,880
Can you... I imagine you can lose, right?

2410
02:27:40,320 --> 02:27:42,920
Like you can't lose.

2411
02:27:45,100 --> 02:27:47,180
It'd be ridiculous otherwise.

2412
02:27:49,340 --> 02:27:50,620
My money!

2413
02:27:51,360 --> 02:27:53,040
I need the limiter, please.

2414
02:27:55,820 --> 02:27:57,880
Am I dying?

2415
02:27:58,200 --> 02:27:58,540
No!

2416
02:28:07,410 --> 02:28:09,230
What's the survival rate?

2417
02:28:11,070 --> 02:28:11,550
Nice!

2418
02:28:15,550 --> 02:28:17,310
Don't want no stinking cure.

2419
02:28:20,930 --> 02:28:22,090
You guys are so funny.

2420
02:28:26,770 --> 02:28:27,250
Launch.

2421
02:28:28,290 --> 02:28:28,490
Oops.

2422
02:28:29,370 --> 02:28:29,730
Oh wait.

2423
02:28:31,490 --> 02:28:33,370
We'll just hold on to it for now.

2424
02:28:33,470 --> 02:28:34,230
We won't use it.

2425
02:28:35,090 --> 02:28:36,390
I don't like that one.

2426
02:28:36,390 --> 02:28:41,390
It's good for only like if you're doing that one challenge where you don't...

2427
02:28:42,690 --> 02:28:44,770
Level up your main weapon, right?

2428
02:28:46,090 --> 02:28:46,690
0%.

2429
02:28:52,660 --> 02:28:54,740
Thought about playing Resident Evil series.

2430
02:28:55,700 --> 02:28:56,060
Maybe.

2431
02:28:58,420 --> 02:28:59,760
I'm not opposed.

2432
02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:03,000
Maybe like the remakes of some of the games which...

2433
02:29:03,540 --> 02:29:06,700
Which might make some people be like...

2434
02:29:06,700 --> 02:29:08,940
Oh, you're only gonna play the remake?

2435
02:29:11,440 --> 02:29:11,840
But...

2436
02:29:12,600 --> 02:29:16,940
I've played old Resident Evil and I'm not...

2437
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:19,840
So good at it.

2438
02:29:20,460 --> 02:29:21,300
I didn't beat it.

2439
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:24,940
I mean I was like, you know, really young when I played it, but...

2440
02:29:28,310 --> 02:29:29,290
Still no DMC.

2441
02:29:29,450 --> 02:29:30,310
What are you talking about?

2442
02:29:30,610 --> 02:29:31,530
I just got back.

2443
02:29:31,630 --> 02:29:32,950
Oh, I didn't make any more money.

2444
02:29:33,390 --> 02:29:34,390
I just got back.

2445
02:29:34,470 --> 02:29:35,970
Of course there will be more DMC.

2446
02:29:35,970 --> 02:29:37,970
Let's see...

2447
02:29:40,210 --> 02:29:41,130
This does...

2448
02:29:41,790 --> 02:29:43,570
Just let me get back into it, you know?

2449
02:29:47,550 --> 02:29:48,010
Yay!

2450
02:29:51,010 --> 02:29:53,250
Use special to kill singular enemy.

2451
02:29:53,510 --> 02:29:54,210
Oh yeah, yeah.

2452
02:29:54,650 --> 02:29:56,690
What is Peko's special actually?

2453
02:29:57,330 --> 02:29:58,190
Let's see!

2454
02:29:58,690 --> 02:30:00,490
Oh, I still have to move around?

2455
02:30:00,590 --> 02:30:00,730
Okay.

2456
02:30:07,390 --> 02:30:07,990
Jackpot!

2457
02:30:09,970 --> 02:30:11,490
Hot dog indeed.

2458
02:30:14,290 --> 02:30:15,490
My eyes.

2459
02:30:22,390 --> 02:30:24,050
Month 7 of Minto virus.

2460
02:30:27,030 --> 02:30:28,050
Thank you.

2461
02:30:28,770 --> 02:30:31,030
A cure has been found, but Wisps refuse to take it.

2462
02:30:31,130 --> 02:30:33,470
Sighting that Minto is their Kamiyoshi and don't need a cure.

2463
02:30:42,730 --> 02:30:43,330
Good.

2464
02:30:43,330 --> 02:30:47,170
I just keep haunting you.

2465
02:30:47,310 --> 02:30:48,130
That's really it.

2466
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:54,420
The more I haunt...

2467
02:30:56,240 --> 02:30:57,760
Maybe it's like a Stockholm syndrome.

2468
02:30:59,780 --> 02:31:00,300
Perhaps.

2469
02:31:02,320 --> 02:31:03,420
Get in line, Ari bro.

2470
02:31:03,560 --> 02:31:04,820
We Yakuza bro as first.

2471
02:31:08,140 --> 02:31:09,640
Oh, what was it?

2472
02:31:10,780 --> 02:31:13,900
Quite recently, they had like a sale...

2473
02:31:13,900 --> 02:31:17,140
Of all the Yakuza games and I bought them all, so...

2474
02:31:17,500 --> 02:31:20,040
I'm ready for...

2475
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:22,200
After DMC...

2476
02:31:22,200 --> 02:31:24,960
I'm ready to go...

2477
02:31:24,960 --> 02:31:27,900
Well, I don't know if I'm gonna do Ace Combat first or...

2478
02:31:28,540 --> 02:31:29,560
Yakuza first.

2479
02:31:29,620 --> 02:31:32,240
They're both long, so...

2480
02:31:32,900 --> 02:31:34,220
But I do have all of them.

2481
02:31:39,740 --> 02:31:40,660
I'm ready.

2482
02:31:44,130 --> 02:31:45,050
I'll take that.

2483
02:31:46,250 --> 02:31:49,610
I need more healing things, cause I'm stupid.

2484
02:31:54,210 --> 02:31:55,570
What the?

2485
02:31:55,930 --> 02:31:57,710
That box didn't have anything in it.

2486
02:32:02,790 --> 02:32:05,170
Alright, let's go for more money!

2487
02:32:08,230 --> 02:32:08,910
Yeah!

2488
02:32:10,350 --> 02:32:11,870
Get in line, bozos.

2489
02:32:11,990 --> 02:32:13,870
Minto promised she'd start...

2490
02:32:15,030 --> 02:32:16,670
She gets back...

2491
02:32:20,070 --> 02:32:21,850
I did say that, didn't I?

2492
02:32:23,430 --> 02:32:25,570
There's so many things to do!

2493
02:32:29,640 --> 02:32:31,960
What was I thinking of with the axe?

2494
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:35,280
OK, sorry guys.

2495
02:32:35,420 --> 02:32:36,420
We're gonna eliminate them.

2496
02:32:37,580 --> 02:32:37,940
OK.

2497
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:43,920
So many games.

2498
02:32:43,920 --> 02:32:47,640
So many games and I would say so little time, but actually...

2499
02:32:47,640 --> 02:32:48,280
There's a lot of time.

2500
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:49,920
You know?

2501
02:32:52,520 --> 02:32:54,900
There's a lot of time, so...

2502
02:32:54,900 --> 02:32:55,560
It's all good.

2503
02:32:57,260 --> 02:32:58,680
Or you can play Yakuza first.

2504
02:32:58,800 --> 02:32:59,280
I don't mind.

2505
02:33:00,920 --> 02:33:02,360
Why do you think it's only for you, huh?

2506
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:03,920
I also wanna play.

2507
02:33:04,600 --> 02:33:04,840
Huh?

2508
02:33:14,270 --> 02:33:15,230
Infinite time.

2509
02:33:17,210 --> 02:33:17,690
Yeah.

2510
02:33:18,330 --> 02:33:19,230
Lots of time.

2511
02:33:19,830 --> 02:33:21,230
So don't worry, guys.

2512
02:33:22,410 --> 02:33:24,230
You're like, she'll never get around to it.

2513
02:33:25,310 --> 02:33:26,230
There's time.

2514
02:33:27,170 --> 02:33:28,130
It's all good.

2515
02:33:28,410 --> 02:33:29,150
It's all OK.

2516
02:33:30,350 --> 02:33:33,370
I like just the random bouts of money that just spring...

2517
02:33:33,370 --> 02:33:34,850
Am I never gonna get another staff?

2518
02:33:34,870 --> 02:33:35,670
What is this?

2519
02:33:37,230 --> 02:33:38,590
I try to be nice to you.

2520
02:33:41,210 --> 02:33:43,290
Even 9 is being tsundere to me.

2521
02:33:43,370 --> 02:33:44,010
What is this?

2522
02:33:45,190 --> 02:33:48,390
I played Ace Combat 7 this year and it was amazing, isn't it?

2523
02:33:49,090 --> 02:33:49,490
So...

2524
02:33:50,470 --> 02:33:51,270
So good.

2525
02:33:59,290 --> 02:34:00,830
Glad to hear you had a good trip, Minto.

2526
02:34:01,570 --> 02:34:05,050
Looking forward to having streams to relax during the night again.

2527
02:34:06,030 --> 02:34:06,330
Yeah.

2528
02:34:07,370 --> 02:34:08,210
I did have a good trip.

2529
02:34:08,270 --> 02:34:08,770
It was fun.

2530
02:34:08,890 --> 02:34:10,650
It was a...

2531
02:34:10,650 --> 02:34:11,650
Oh my gosh.

2532
02:34:12,490 --> 02:34:14,830
Oh, I'll do Spider-Quick again.

2533
02:34:14,830 --> 02:34:17,710
My luck, though, is just so bad the whole trip.

2534
02:34:18,410 --> 02:34:19,930
I forgot a bunch of stuff.

2535
02:34:20,290 --> 02:34:21,830
I had a moment where, like...

2536
02:34:25,550 --> 02:34:26,030
Where...

2537
02:34:26,030 --> 02:34:29,410
I bring... I have daily contacts, right?

2538
02:34:31,030 --> 02:34:34,850
And I opened up one of my contacts and it was already dried out.

2539
02:34:35,890 --> 02:34:38,890
Luckily, I always bring, like, an extra day's worth.

2540
02:34:39,550 --> 02:34:43,510
And at first I thought I didn't have enough, but I actually did have enough, so...

2541
02:34:44,830 --> 02:34:46,830
It was okay, but...

2542
02:34:47,430 --> 02:34:49,830
You should play more streams...

2543
02:34:50,530 --> 02:34:52,410
Or more games off-stream.

2544
02:34:52,770 --> 02:34:53,210
Wait.

2545
02:34:54,810 --> 02:34:56,010
Why did that bother?

2546
02:34:57,530 --> 02:34:58,950
Thank you guys for the super chat.

2547
02:34:59,010 --> 02:34:59,570
Thank you.

2548
02:35:02,970 --> 02:35:07,410
Yeah, but I was just so annoyed because now my eyes are two different prescriptions, right?

2549
02:35:07,450 --> 02:35:09,590
So now I have...

2550
02:35:09,590 --> 02:35:12,050
I have one extra.

2551
02:35:12,730 --> 02:35:13,770
So annoying.

2552
02:35:17,050 --> 02:35:18,170
And then...

2553
02:35:23,140 --> 02:35:30,300
While everyone is recommending games, if my monkey's paw wish comes true and they re-release Transformers War for Cybertron on Steam...

2554
02:35:30,920 --> 02:35:32,960
You should definitely play the co-op campaign with Doki.

2555
02:35:56,500 --> 02:35:58,640
I don't think I have this one.

2556
02:36:00,140 --> 02:36:01,720
There was one...

2557
02:36:05,690 --> 02:36:06,610
There was...

2558
02:36:07,930 --> 02:36:08,390
One...

2559
02:36:08,390 --> 02:36:10,590
Game I got...

2560
02:36:10,590 --> 02:36:11,990
That was a Transformers game.

2561
02:36:15,030 --> 02:36:15,490
That...

2562
02:36:15,490 --> 02:36:17,270
I think was only for Xbox.

2563
02:36:23,950 --> 02:36:25,250
I'll have to check it later.

2564
02:36:25,430 --> 02:36:26,270
That's gonna bother me.

2565
02:36:30,410 --> 02:36:30,870
Devastation?

2566
02:36:30,990 --> 02:36:31,670
It might have been.

2567
02:36:35,580 --> 02:36:36,660
Oh, what's this?

2568
02:36:36,960 --> 02:36:37,880
Oh, oh, oh, box!

2569
02:36:37,880 --> 02:36:39,320
Where did this box come from?

2570
02:36:39,780 --> 02:36:40,920
Yay, money!

2571
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:44,520
Take.

2572
02:36:50,840 --> 02:36:51,280
Take.

2573
02:36:55,170 --> 02:36:56,250
It's free.

2574
02:36:58,130 --> 02:37:00,890
Am I ever gonna get another sticker ever again?

2575
02:37:01,230 --> 02:37:01,890
Or another stamp?

2576
02:37:02,690 --> 02:37:03,450
Maybe not.

2577
02:37:03,450 --> 02:37:03,530
Take.

2578
02:37:15,680 --> 02:37:16,240
Yippee!

2579
02:37:16,240 --> 02:37:16,800
Yippee!

2580
02:37:19,480 --> 02:37:20,040
Nice.

2581
02:37:21,720 --> 02:37:22,520
Spudder cookie.

2582
02:37:26,310 --> 02:37:27,450
I like Pekora.

2583
02:37:28,110 --> 02:37:28,650
Yeah.

2584
02:37:29,950 --> 02:37:31,290
I like playing as her.

2585
02:37:32,250 --> 02:37:33,130
Ok, that one's max.

2586
02:37:33,230 --> 02:37:33,510
Nice.

2587
02:37:33,650 --> 02:37:34,190
Ok, there we go.

2588
02:37:35,230 --> 02:37:36,730
Oh my gosh!

2589
02:37:36,950 --> 02:37:37,110
Wait.

2590
02:37:37,110 --> 02:37:37,110
Wait.

2591
02:37:37,430 --> 02:37:38,750
Oh, oh, oh.

2592
02:37:41,310 --> 02:37:41,710
Upgrade?

2593
02:37:42,750 --> 02:37:43,910
Free upgrade, let's go.

2594
02:37:44,910 --> 02:37:45,690
Aw, man.

2595
02:37:52,830 --> 02:37:54,470
What did I get as my item?

2596
02:37:54,570 --> 02:37:55,090
I don't remember.

2597
02:37:56,890 --> 02:37:57,810
No one has them.

2598
02:37:57,990 --> 02:38:00,130
My memory is Hasbro literally lost the game file.

2599
02:38:00,210 --> 02:38:02,290
So unless you bought it back in the day, it's lost to time.

2600
02:38:03,950 --> 02:38:05,110
Maybe then I don't have it.

2601
02:38:05,870 --> 02:38:07,090
I don't know which one I have.

2602
02:38:07,590 --> 02:38:08,470
I'm gonna check later.

2603
02:38:12,930 --> 02:38:13,370
Dash?

2604
02:38:13,550 --> 02:38:14,410
I don't...

2605
02:38:14,410 --> 02:38:15,410
Oh, I do have dash.

2606
02:38:15,430 --> 02:38:15,810
Just kidding.

2607
02:38:15,930 --> 02:38:17,970
I thought it was down here in the bottom left.

2608
02:38:18,570 --> 02:38:19,710
Ok, I did get dash.

2609
02:38:21,850 --> 02:38:22,290
Yeah!

2610
02:38:28,010 --> 02:38:28,890
Is Pekora...

2611
02:38:31,930 --> 02:38:32,810
Is she...

2612
02:38:32,810 --> 02:38:34,410
Lacking in...

2613
02:38:38,370 --> 02:38:38,810
In...

2614
02:38:42,870 --> 02:38:43,350
Uh...

2615
02:38:43,350 --> 02:38:45,410
Does she have...

2616
02:38:47,370 --> 02:38:47,850
Yes?

2617
02:38:48,650 --> 02:38:49,130
Really?

2618
02:38:49,250 --> 02:38:51,390
She always gives a big boob energy.

2619
02:38:55,770 --> 02:38:56,670
She's in the middle.

2620
02:39:00,790 --> 02:39:02,190
Cutting board is good for her.

2621
02:39:02,750 --> 02:39:03,670
I wish I had dash.

2622
02:39:03,710 --> 02:39:04,850
I wish I...

2623
02:39:05,330 --> 02:39:07,790
I wish I had... Ok, we'll get the bouncy ball then.

2624
02:39:08,670 --> 02:39:10,570
I wish I had dashed earlier.

2625
02:39:19,510 --> 02:39:19,990
I

2626
02:39:25,100 --> 02:39:28,420
think I already have the achievement for...

2627
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:30,920
For...

2628
02:39:31,500 --> 02:39:34,340
For getting rid of one, by the way, in case you're wondering.

2629
02:39:36,500 --> 02:39:37,460
Super headphones.

2630
02:39:38,500 --> 02:39:39,180
I'll take it.

2631
02:39:48,790 --> 02:39:49,270
Uh...

2632
02:39:55,430 --> 02:39:57,910
I was able to finish Ace Combat 5.

2633
02:40:00,230 --> 02:40:02,010
On the time of the 20th anniversary.

2634
02:40:02,150 --> 02:40:02,650
Oh, nice!

2635
02:40:09,230 --> 02:40:12,430
I feel like Pekora is...

2636
02:40:12,430 --> 02:40:15,270
Fun for money, but not great for money.

2637
02:40:15,630 --> 02:40:17,410
Unless maybe it's good...

2638
02:40:17,410 --> 02:40:19,530
If you have...

2639
02:40:19,530 --> 02:40:20,610
Oh, I wanted to pee a little bit.

2640
02:40:21,210 --> 02:40:23,450
It's good if you have... What's it called?

2641
02:40:23,570 --> 02:40:23,890
Oh my god.

2642
02:40:27,430 --> 02:40:29,850
I can finally get the other staff.

2643
02:40:33,340 --> 02:40:34,420
What was I saying?

2644
02:40:36,320 --> 02:40:38,760
Oh, good if you have greed is what I was about to say.

2645
02:40:43,020 --> 02:40:43,580
Upgrade!

2646
02:40:47,480 --> 02:40:48,280
Bouncy ball.

2647
02:40:51,780 --> 02:40:52,340
Biyobo.

2648
02:40:54,260 --> 02:40:54,820
Biyobo.

2649
02:40:55,480 --> 02:40:55,840
Nice.

2650
02:40:57,180 --> 02:40:59,240
Super chat... Oh yeah, or super chatto, right?

2651
02:40:59,700 --> 02:41:03,060
Unless that doesn't affect her...

2652
02:41:03,060 --> 02:41:04,180
Thing, I'm not sure.

2653
02:41:05,880 --> 02:41:06,360
Goodness.

2654
02:41:07,460 --> 02:41:08,940
I got another one.

2655
02:41:09,420 --> 02:41:09,940
What's this one?

2656
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:11,540
Yeah.

2657
02:41:13,360 --> 02:41:17,220
That would have been so good for the...

2658
02:41:17,900 --> 02:41:20,000
Wait, Marine was not crit, was it?

2659
02:41:20,280 --> 02:41:20,880
It was pick up.

2660
02:41:20,980 --> 02:41:21,340
Just kidding.

2661
02:41:22,340 --> 02:41:23,720
Oh, super chatto time does help her.

2662
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:29,440
Minto personifies greed.

2663
02:41:30,800 --> 02:41:34,870
Oh, not windows.

2664
02:41:35,130 --> 02:41:36,310
My tab just crashed.

2665
02:41:36,690 --> 02:41:37,770
Am I still live?

2666
02:41:43,340 --> 02:41:47,960
Viewers are reacting to Minto holo cure gameplay discussing various aspects of the gameplay.

2667
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:50,260
I am a kicker.

2668
02:41:56,410 --> 02:41:58,030
I'm not live.

2669
02:41:58,750 --> 02:42:00,550
In fact, I'm quite dead.

2670
02:42:03,910 --> 02:42:05,870
I'm quite dead actually.

2671
02:42:07,850 --> 02:42:09,110
Yeah, you thought.

2672
02:42:13,670 --> 02:42:15,170
I used it, I used it.

2673
02:42:17,210 --> 02:42:18,710
We are doing game suggestions.

2674
02:42:19,050 --> 02:42:19,250
No!

2675
02:42:21,930 --> 02:42:24,850
I have so many games that I need to get through.

2676
02:42:26,290 --> 02:42:27,690
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my goodness.

2677
02:42:33,290 --> 02:42:35,270
I saw the TMNT...

2678
02:42:41,950 --> 02:42:42,350
TMNT...

2679
02:42:42,350 --> 02:42:43,990
Shredder's Revenge.

2680
02:42:44,570 --> 02:42:45,730
Six player online?

2681
02:42:45,990 --> 02:42:46,530
No way.

2682
02:42:47,870 --> 02:42:49,890
Sorry, I'm like kind of paying attention.

2683
02:42:50,730 --> 02:42:51,810
Oh, nice!

2684
02:42:52,090 --> 02:42:53,490
We are doing so much better with Peckle.

2685
02:43:04,680 --> 02:43:05,800
Study glasses.

2686
02:43:09,230 --> 02:43:11,570
Isn't this better to get like towards the beginning?

2687
02:43:12,330 --> 02:43:13,670
Hey, first super chat here.

2688
02:43:13,670 --> 02:43:16,030
I have to correct the other guy.

2689
02:43:20,680 --> 02:43:23,620
You didn't super chat just to correct somebody.

2690
02:43:24,060 --> 02:43:26,280
You didn't super chat just to... Actually...

2691
02:43:29,840 --> 02:43:31,760
Hasbro did not lose the transformer files.

2692
02:43:31,880 --> 02:43:34,020
Activision just doesn't have the license right now.

2693
02:43:34,340 --> 02:43:36,620
I would cite my source, but I have no room.

2694
02:43:36,720 --> 02:43:37,380
Thank you, Nicholas.

2695
02:43:49,650 --> 02:43:50,570
There you go.

2696
02:43:52,690 --> 02:43:57,330
The source is the super chat... The source is he has no room.

2697
02:43:58,470 --> 02:44:02,950
Why didn't you just put source semicolon source name?

2698
02:44:07,290 --> 02:44:10,790
Ace Combat is... If you're really good, you can speedrun.

2699
02:44:11,610 --> 02:44:14,250
I'm gonna be so bad when I... You know what?

2700
02:44:14,350 --> 02:44:15,110
I'll just take it.

2701
02:44:15,410 --> 02:44:15,970
It's free.

2702
02:44:16,890 --> 02:44:21,430
I'm gonna be so bad when I get back to playing it again since I haven't played it in so long.

2703
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:28,780
I'm gonna stall all the time.

2704
02:44:36,070 --> 02:44:36,730
No!

2705
02:44:38,030 --> 02:44:39,610
Let's do a bouncy ball.

2706
02:44:42,910 --> 02:44:45,810
We'll get a cutting board eventually, probably.

2707
02:44:46,850 --> 02:44:49,150
Oh my gosh, we're blowing up everything.

2708
02:44:50,210 --> 02:44:51,230
Let's go.

2709
02:44:57,230 --> 02:44:57,950
Nice.

2710
02:45:03,090 --> 02:45:03,810
Weep,

2711
02:45:07,320 --> 02:45:08,700
weep, weep, weep.

2712
02:45:10,520 --> 02:45:12,180
Guys, I'm getting so sleepy.

2713
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:18,440
Re-roll.

2714
02:45:22,510 --> 02:45:23,290
Bouncy ball.

2715
02:45:27,130 --> 02:45:28,190
Bouncy ball.

2716
02:45:31,790 --> 02:45:33,950
I wanna play some Blackjack some more.

2717
02:45:34,930 --> 02:45:36,970
I wanna play all the Blackjack.

2718
02:45:37,970 --> 02:45:40,570
Peter, thanks for 7 months.

2719
02:45:40,870 --> 02:45:41,450
Thank you.

2720
02:45:43,170 --> 02:45:44,550
Watch other people play.

2721
02:45:46,090 --> 02:45:48,150
Ace Combat girl channel.

2722
02:45:50,950 --> 02:45:54,870
A female is playing Ace Combat.

2723
02:45:55,710 --> 02:45:56,450
Oh my god.

2724
02:45:56,450 --> 02:46:08,810
A girl is playing Ace Combat.

2725
02:46:18,290 --> 02:46:20,010
This guy is no no gender.

2726
02:46:22,530 --> 02:46:23,370
What is this?

2727
02:46:23,970 --> 02:46:25,710
Oh, I guess it works.

2728
02:46:26,110 --> 02:46:27,390
Wait, is my green maxed out?

2729
02:46:27,650 --> 02:46:28,390
Nope, nevermind.

2730
02:46:30,890 --> 02:46:32,030
I'm greedy.

2731
02:46:32,910 --> 02:46:34,210
I'm greedy!

2732
02:46:36,070 --> 02:46:37,270
I'm greedy!

2733
02:46:44,220 --> 02:46:45,300
Oh no.

2734
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,360
I guess we'll do the steady glasses.

2735
02:46:56,080 --> 02:46:59,240
Do you think we'll beat this one finally, you guys?

2736
02:46:59,960 --> 02:47:01,860
I'm not locked in.

2737
02:47:01,900 --> 02:47:02,800
Oh wait, I forgot.

2738
02:47:03,060 --> 02:47:05,160
I can use my special and get more money.

2739
02:47:08,040 --> 02:47:09,280
Or not!

2740
02:47:09,880 --> 02:47:10,400
What?

2741
02:47:11,140 --> 02:47:12,380
Are you kidding me?

2742
02:47:12,520 --> 02:47:13,920
You can even lose that?

2743
02:47:14,500 --> 02:47:15,860
I hate this.

2744
02:47:15,960 --> 02:47:18,020
I'm never playing Pakora again.

2745
02:47:24,620 --> 02:47:26,540
What are you talking about?

2746
02:47:34,290 --> 02:47:35,910
Still does damage though.

2747
02:47:35,970 --> 02:47:37,030
I guess that's good.

2748
02:47:37,030 --> 02:47:38,450
I guess.

2749
02:47:39,590 --> 02:47:40,750
Oh, steady glasses.

2750
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:46,400
Apply.

2751
02:47:50,710 --> 02:47:52,970
Girls don't play video games, you guys.

2752
02:47:55,270 --> 02:47:58,870
Girls paint their nails and are stupid.

2753
02:48:00,550 --> 02:48:02,290
Girls don't play video games.

2754
02:48:02,850 --> 02:48:09,610
They paint their nails, talk about tiny dresses and be stupid.

2755
02:48:11,250 --> 02:48:12,610
Everybody knows this.

2756
02:48:17,970 --> 02:48:19,610
Stopping by to check in.

2757
02:48:19,770 --> 02:48:21,410
By the way, I check in every once in a while.

2758
02:48:21,910 --> 02:48:23,950
Because I'm not allowed to watch Vtubers.

2759
02:48:39,570 --> 02:48:41,890
Tell girls to stop coming for my hobbies.

2760
02:48:42,430 --> 02:48:43,630
What's your hobby, huh?

2761
02:48:45,770 --> 02:48:47,310
Maybe your hobby is really fun.

2762
02:48:51,510 --> 02:48:52,430
What the?

2763
02:48:52,690 --> 02:48:53,450
New stamp.

2764
02:48:54,330 --> 02:48:54,730
Why?

2765
02:48:56,890 --> 02:48:57,850
Rock hard.

2766
02:48:58,310 --> 02:49:04,210
While not moving, increase the damage of this weapon by 20% and reduce the time between all weapons by 30%.

2767
02:49:05,110 --> 02:49:06,470
OK, I have to not move.

2768
02:49:14,410 --> 02:49:16,310
OK, we'll get the box and then we'll move.

2769
02:49:21,630 --> 02:49:23,270
Who's holding you against your will?

2770
02:49:23,370 --> 02:49:24,710
Why can't you watch Vtubers?

2771
02:49:25,490 --> 02:49:28,150
Unless you're just like, it's too cringe for me to handle.

2772
02:49:28,570 --> 02:49:30,530
I can't handle the second hand cringe.

2773
02:49:32,510 --> 02:49:34,850
I can't handle the second hand cringe.

2774
02:49:35,790 --> 02:49:36,610
It's too cringe.

2775
02:49:37,510 --> 02:49:38,450
Too cringe.

2776
02:49:41,030 --> 02:49:41,410
You know what?

2777
02:49:41,470 --> 02:49:41,850
Screw it.

2778
02:49:41,890 --> 02:49:42,370
It's free.

2779
02:49:44,890 --> 02:49:45,750
OK, good.

2780
02:49:46,130 --> 02:49:46,670
We lived.

2781
02:49:53,300 --> 02:49:55,100
You get used to it pretty quick.

2782
02:49:59,240 --> 02:50:02,740
My hobby is experiencing second hand cringe.

2783
02:50:03,160 --> 02:50:04,880
You're so brave.

2784
02:50:07,060 --> 02:50:08,920
You're so brave.

2785
02:50:12,160 --> 02:50:15,180
If you're looking for cringe, you've come to the right place.

2786
02:50:16,460 --> 02:50:17,460
I'm the cringe queen.

2787
02:50:20,860 --> 02:50:22,680
The queen of cringe.

2788
02:50:23,920 --> 02:50:26,260
Officially inviting all girls to come to my hobbies.

2789
02:50:26,260 --> 02:50:26,880
Yeah.

2790
02:50:29,540 --> 02:50:33,260
Tiara is single and ready to mingle in hobbies.

2791
02:50:36,960 --> 02:50:40,980
Does it look like the tongue ever slightly looks like Pantsu?

2792
02:50:42,460 --> 02:50:44,480
Wait, it looks more like a Pantsu.

2793
02:50:44,640 --> 02:50:45,440
No, no, no.

2794
02:50:50,920 --> 02:50:52,320
It does not.

2795
02:50:54,080 --> 02:50:55,820
Time to cut!

2796
02:51:05,450 --> 02:51:06,130
We're gonna live.

2797
02:51:07,890 --> 02:51:10,490
Somehow I had invincibility or something.

2798
02:51:11,710 --> 02:51:13,190
Somehow I'm so good at this game.

2799
02:51:14,410 --> 02:51:17,470
It doesn't look like... The old one looked like panties.

2800
02:51:18,090 --> 02:51:19,450
I'll agree with you there.

2801
02:51:20,150 --> 02:51:22,490
But the new one doesn't look like panties at all.

2802
02:51:44,790 --> 02:51:47,150
I'm collecting my...

2803
02:51:48,730 --> 02:51:49,510
There we go.

2804
02:51:49,610 --> 02:51:50,030
Nice.

2805
02:51:50,920 --> 02:51:55,900
Time to see a fanny pack.

2806
02:51:57,660 --> 02:52:01,000
You guys have such mighty imaginations.

2807
02:52:02,060 --> 02:52:03,500
I love that for you.

2808
02:52:05,540 --> 02:52:08,200
You guys have such brilliant imaginations.

2809
02:52:09,900 --> 02:52:15,620
I bet growing up in class you got told you were a gifted child, huh?

2810
02:52:16,780 --> 02:52:18,260
You're the queen of Akihabara.

2811
02:52:18,660 --> 02:52:21,580
That title is definitely not for me.

2812
02:52:22,600 --> 02:52:25,740
That title is for the one and only Momoi Haruko.

2813
02:52:32,920 --> 02:52:34,640
Wait, what goes over the glow stick?

2814
02:52:34,760 --> 02:52:35,620
Is it the fan beam?

2815
02:52:37,680 --> 02:52:41,080
I don't think we'll get to... Super chat time!

2816
02:52:48,250 --> 02:52:49,970
I'm guessing you relate.

2817
02:52:51,830 --> 02:52:54,590
How else would I know if I didn't relate?

2818
02:52:58,830 --> 02:53:02,050
My attempts to become rich through gambling have not paid off.

2819
02:53:02,770 --> 02:53:05,250
But I did come up with a fun idea while drinking moonshine.

2820
02:53:07,350 --> 02:53:10,550
I'm going to infuse my honey with mint when I get home.

2821
02:53:20,520 --> 02:53:22,300
What is moonshine?

2822
02:53:22,640 --> 02:53:25,040
I have a friend that she really loves it.

2823
02:53:25,860 --> 02:53:27,660
But I don't even know what it is.

2824
02:53:36,410 --> 02:53:37,370
Homemade alcohol.

2825
02:53:42,570 --> 02:53:44,510
Alcohol made from corn.

2826
02:53:46,070 --> 02:53:47,210
Is it like a...

2827
02:53:47,750 --> 02:53:51,470
Is it like a...

2828
02:53:53,350 --> 02:53:57,250
I've only ever heard... It sounds like a... What's it called?

2829
02:53:58,010 --> 02:53:58,990
How do I say?

2830
02:54:00,530 --> 02:54:02,550
Like a southern thing.

2831
02:54:02,550 --> 02:54:02,710
Moonshine.

2832
02:54:10,550 --> 02:54:13,110
It really burns?

2833
02:54:14,850 --> 02:54:15,790
My friend's crazy.

2834
02:54:17,010 --> 02:54:20,850
Yeah, she's always just like, I gotta go get my moonshine.

2835
02:54:31,520 --> 02:54:35,460
It's like 90... 90% alcohol?

2836
02:54:41,100 --> 02:54:43,640
My friend's getting...

2837
02:54:43,640 --> 02:54:45,000
She's... How?

2838
02:54:45,620 --> 02:54:46,040
How?

2839
02:54:46,260 --> 02:54:48,320
I don't think I've ever seen her drunk before though.

2840
02:54:49,860 --> 02:54:51,360
Maybe I should use my special.

2841
02:54:53,160 --> 02:54:54,260
Oh, nevermind.

2842
02:54:54,720 --> 02:54:55,480
I did it!

2843
02:54:58,930 --> 02:55:00,590
She's probably joking.

2844
02:55:00,810 --> 02:55:01,050
No!

2845
02:55:02,610 --> 02:55:04,630
She says how much she likes it.

2846
02:55:05,830 --> 02:55:06,710
All the time.

2847
02:55:16,800 --> 02:55:18,240
Flavor of steel.

2848
02:55:18,720 --> 02:55:19,560
Must be.

2849
02:55:25,370 --> 02:55:26,990
Welcome to my... Thank you!

2850
02:55:32,990 --> 02:55:35,390
Oh my gosh guys, we might actually live through this.

2851
02:55:36,130 --> 02:55:38,110
We might live!

2852
02:55:45,190 --> 02:55:45,770
Uh oh.

2853
02:55:46,790 --> 02:55:48,450
The little guys are coming in.

2854
02:55:50,010 --> 02:55:51,330
8-chan inbound.

2855
02:55:55,370 --> 02:55:56,210
Peckle power?

2856
02:55:56,410 --> 02:55:58,110
Nah, I think we got this for real.

2857
02:56:01,670 --> 02:56:02,390
What's this?

2858
02:56:02,510 --> 02:56:02,690
Uh oh.

2859
02:56:02,790 --> 02:56:03,590
Attack size?

2860
02:56:03,930 --> 02:56:05,610
Let's just do my attack finally.

2861
02:56:09,250 --> 02:56:12,090
I wish though I could complete the fan beam.

2862
02:56:16,440 --> 02:56:17,940
I have this turkey up here.

2863
02:56:18,040 --> 02:56:19,160
I've just left it out.

2864
02:56:23,180 --> 02:56:23,780
Whatever.

2865
02:56:25,980 --> 02:56:27,260
I like Pekoras.

2866
02:56:29,860 --> 02:56:30,460
But...

2867
02:56:30,460 --> 02:56:32,700
I'm also scared of Gacha.

2868
02:56:33,420 --> 02:56:33,680
Alright.

2869
02:56:36,560 --> 02:56:37,340
And...

2870
02:56:41,740 --> 02:56:43,240
It's thawing.

2871
02:56:44,400 --> 02:56:45,180
True.

2872
02:56:46,220 --> 02:56:48,460
Oh my god, we just made so much money.

2873
02:56:49,940 --> 02:56:51,040
Jackpot baby.

2874
02:56:51,340 --> 02:56:52,580
Jackpot baby.

2875
02:56:54,280 --> 02:56:56,300
I wish I could get more.

2876
02:56:56,760 --> 02:56:57,520
What's this one again?

2877
02:56:58,500 --> 02:56:59,040
Oh yeah.

2878
02:57:00,460 --> 02:57:00,880
Money.

2879
02:57:01,060 --> 02:57:01,840
That's what it is.

2880
02:57:04,400 --> 02:57:04,960
Boom!

2881
02:57:05,600 --> 02:57:07,540
Double chunk chocolate chunks.

2882
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:08,440
Boom!

2883
02:57:12,580 --> 02:57:16,460
I've come around so much on the Costco guys that...

2884
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,960
It's just, it's so cringe it's funny to me at this point.

2885
02:57:20,440 --> 02:57:21,100
You know what I mean?

2886
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:22,800
I hate this one.

2887
02:57:27,780 --> 02:57:28,180
Boom!

2888
02:57:28,380 --> 02:57:30,180
Double chunk chunk chocolate cookie.

2889
02:57:31,560 --> 02:57:31,960
Boom!

2890
02:57:33,860 --> 02:57:36,020
But it's like, not funny...

2891
02:57:36,020 --> 02:57:38,720
Like I don't watch them, I just, I think it's funny to quote it.

2892
02:57:39,240 --> 02:57:39,900
You know what I mean?

2893
02:57:47,210 --> 02:57:48,530
Oh nice, nice, nice.

2894
02:57:48,570 --> 02:57:49,770
We might actually get the thing.

2895
02:57:51,370 --> 02:57:52,110
Oh my god.

2896
02:57:52,250 --> 02:57:52,610
Oh my good.

2897
02:57:52,810 --> 02:57:53,250
Oh my good.

2898
02:57:53,250 --> 02:57:53,870
There we go.

2899
02:57:54,010 --> 02:57:54,450
Oh my good.

2900
02:57:57,080 --> 02:57:58,230
Where's my gold?

2901
02:58:00,790 --> 02:58:02,550
We're mental guys.

2902
02:58:04,090 --> 02:58:05,470
I'll take it.

2903
02:58:07,790 --> 02:58:09,510
Where's my gold anvil?

2904
02:58:27,580 --> 02:58:28,440
Nice.

2905
02:58:29,360 --> 02:58:29,820
Nice.

2906
02:58:32,100 --> 02:58:34,160
What if I gotcha right here?

2907
02:58:34,840 --> 02:58:35,580
In the butt.

2908
02:58:35,580 --> 02:58:36,600
Wow!

2909
02:58:40,230 --> 02:58:43,730
My eyes are not for the Toho's right now.

2910
02:58:47,050 --> 02:58:48,610
Oh, I thought she died.

2911
02:58:49,570 --> 02:58:50,510
Thought we were close.

2912
02:58:57,990 --> 02:59:03,210
During Minecraft hardcore collab, you used both Mog and Cap.

2913
02:59:03,790 --> 02:59:05,090
Completely unironically.

2914
02:59:05,610 --> 02:59:06,530
What happened to you?

2915
02:59:30,810 --> 02:59:32,630
Blame Doki for everything.

2916
02:59:32,630 --> 02:59:38,850
I legitimately become dumb around her, so...

2917
02:59:38,850 --> 02:59:40,370
Honestly, it's not my fault.

2918
02:59:42,970 --> 02:59:44,930
You can blame Doki for everything.

2919
02:59:47,790 --> 02:59:49,530
Also, shut the hell up Nani.

2920
02:59:49,650 --> 02:59:50,430
I don't wanna hear anything.

2921
02:59:50,630 --> 02:59:52,170
I don't wanna hear anything from you.

2922
02:59:53,310 --> 02:59:55,790
I don't wanna hear anything from you.

2923
02:59:56,250 --> 02:59:56,590
Okay?

2924
02:59:56,590 --> 02:59:56,850
Okay?

2925
03:00:07,330 --> 03:00:08,010
Yay!

2926
03:00:08,370 --> 03:00:09,690
We did it!

2927
03:00:12,550 --> 03:00:13,890
Blame accepted.

2928
03:00:23,630 --> 03:00:24,470
I will thank her.

2929
03:00:24,590 --> 03:00:26,670
You're both extra cute like this.

2930
03:00:27,950 --> 03:00:29,330
Justice for Nani.

2931
03:00:43,310 --> 03:00:44,970
Would Big Boss use that language?

2932
03:00:46,650 --> 03:00:49,630
Only language that Big Boss would use, right?

2933
03:00:49,630 --> 03:00:54,130
Only the language of the Big Boss.

2934
03:00:59,030 --> 03:01:00,390
Oh my god.

2935
03:01:04,760 --> 03:01:07,380
If I make them not hungry...

2936
03:01:07,380 --> 03:01:10,160
Look, they come to the fence begging for food.

2937
03:01:10,720 --> 03:01:11,660
You want some food?

2938
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:15,320
You want some food?

2939
03:01:15,420 --> 03:01:16,840
Only Bloodloss gets food.

2940
03:01:17,960 --> 03:01:20,540
He's gonna become my horse.

2941
03:01:23,140 --> 03:01:24,120
Okay, come on.

2942
03:01:24,240 --> 03:01:25,240
Come on, Bloodloss.

2943
03:01:25,300 --> 03:01:26,540
We're sending you to the...

2944
03:01:28,440 --> 03:01:29,340
To the rink.

2945
03:01:33,050 --> 03:01:33,690
Come on.

2946
03:01:34,390 --> 03:01:35,510
Come on, Bloodloss.

2947
03:01:37,250 --> 03:01:38,530
Come on, Bloodloss.

2948
03:01:45,100 --> 03:01:46,880
There was another one here too, right?

2949
03:01:47,080 --> 03:01:47,720
It was like a...

2950
03:01:49,220 --> 03:01:50,320
Actually, this one.

2951
03:01:52,460 --> 03:01:52,900
Racing.

2952
03:01:53,280 --> 03:01:54,100
I can train him.

2953
03:01:54,340 --> 03:01:55,320
Alright, Bloodloss, train.

2954
03:01:57,140 --> 03:01:58,980
Level point eleven.

2955
03:02:00,600 --> 03:02:02,320
Oh, I see.

2956
03:02:02,760 --> 03:02:05,440
That's why I couldn't tell that I needed to train.

2957
03:02:05,880 --> 03:02:09,460
Oh, it's expensive.

2958
03:02:11,040 --> 03:02:12,080
Oh no.

2959
03:02:17,210 --> 03:02:18,530
It's worth it.

2960
03:02:19,190 --> 03:02:19,750
He's training.

2961
03:02:19,910 --> 03:02:20,150
Yeah!

2962
03:02:21,050 --> 03:02:21,870
Bloodloss.

2963
03:02:22,270 --> 03:02:23,970
Alright, Bloodloss, go into the race.

2964
03:02:24,810 --> 03:02:25,530
Hot dog.

2965
03:02:26,670 --> 03:02:27,890
Course one.

2966
03:02:28,290 --> 03:02:29,810
There's a fee to join.

2967
03:02:30,270 --> 03:02:31,110
Alright, Bloodloss.

2968
03:02:32,930 --> 03:02:34,130
Why you have only... Wait.

2969
03:02:37,570 --> 03:02:38,170
Oh, wait.

2970
03:02:40,190 --> 03:02:41,670
Maybe he doesn't have the best stats.

2971
03:02:41,870 --> 03:02:42,270
You know what?

2972
03:02:42,290 --> 03:02:42,470
Whatever.

2973
03:02:43,430 --> 03:02:44,310
Here we go.

2974
03:02:45,290 --> 03:02:45,610
Go!

2975
03:02:47,050 --> 03:02:47,790
Oh my god.

2976
03:02:48,070 --> 03:02:49,090
I'm scared for you.

2977
03:02:50,370 --> 03:02:52,150
Why are you lagging behind a little bit?

2978
03:02:52,750 --> 03:02:54,110
Oh my god.

2979
03:02:54,190 --> 03:02:54,650
No, he's good.

2980
03:02:54,730 --> 03:02:54,950
He's good.

2981
03:02:54,970 --> 03:02:55,270
He's good.

2982
03:02:55,270 --> 03:02:56,510
Go, Bloodloss!

2983
03:02:56,590 --> 03:02:56,970
Go!

2984
03:02:57,130 --> 03:02:57,510
Oh my god.

2985
03:02:57,550 --> 03:02:57,750
Go!

2986
03:02:58,290 --> 03:02:59,070
Bloodloss!

2987
03:04:24,660 --> 03:04:26,440
Oh my god.

2988
03:04:26,520 --> 03:04:26,980
Redemption.

2989
03:04:28,060 --> 03:04:28,760
Redemption.

2990
03:04:30,600 --> 03:04:31,380
Redemption.

2991
03:04:32,540 --> 03:04:34,120
I believe in you, Bloodloss.

2992
03:04:36,040 --> 03:04:37,360
Holy moly.

2993
03:04:37,760 --> 03:04:38,540
Oh my god.

2994
03:04:46,200 --> 03:04:46,980
Bloodloss!

2995
03:04:47,220 --> 03:04:48,000
Bloodloss!

2996
03:04:48,120 --> 03:04:48,880
Bloodloss!

2997
03:04:48,940 --> 03:04:49,380
Bloodloss!

2998
03:04:49,480 --> 03:04:49,860
Bloodloss!

2999
03:04:49,980 --> 03:04:50,400
Bloodloss!

3000
03:05:09,730 --> 03:05:10,210
Oh...

3001
03:05:11,990 --> 03:05:12,470
Rinto!

3002
03:05:13,030 --> 03:05:14,470
You and Doki are my kami-yoshi.

3003
03:05:14,610 --> 03:05:17,150
I wanted a happy birthday from both of you during the off-colab.

3004
03:05:17,270 --> 03:05:18,610
I thought I could wait until next month.

3005
03:05:19,270 --> 03:05:21,830
I forgot my birthday is not the 18th next month.

3006
03:05:22,030 --> 03:05:23,490
What do you mean you forgot?

3007
03:05:24,110 --> 03:05:24,590
Cypher!

3008
03:05:30,130 --> 03:05:31,450
Oh my gosh.

3009
03:05:32,150 --> 03:05:33,830
Happy birthday, Cypher!

3010
03:05:39,390 --> 03:05:41,130
Nobody tell Tear, by the way.

3011
03:05:41,190 --> 03:05:41,950
Nobody tell Tear.

3012
03:05:43,450 --> 03:05:46,490
Happy birthday to you!

3013
03:05:47,010 --> 03:05:49,890
Happy birthday to you!

3014
03:05:50,970 --> 03:05:54,350
Happy birthday, dear Cypher!

3015
03:05:57,010 --> 03:06:00,250
Happy birthday to you!

3016
03:06:04,430 --> 03:06:05,590
What was it?

3017
03:06:05,650 --> 03:06:08,530
I don't remember why we were talking about you, Doki and I.

3018
03:06:09,370 --> 03:06:15,230
But she mentioned that she met you at a meet-and-greet.

3019
03:06:15,410 --> 03:06:17,370
And she was like, you're that, Cypher?

3020
03:06:20,830 --> 03:06:21,390
Funny.

3021
03:06:27,690 --> 03:06:30,130
Bloodloss, maybe we need to train him some more.

3022
03:06:31,170 --> 03:06:31,730
Train!

3023
03:06:33,390 --> 03:06:33,950
Train!

3024
03:06:34,370 --> 03:06:34,650
Train!

3025
03:06:36,750 --> 03:06:39,890
Okay, I'm spending big bucks on you, Bloodloss.

3026
03:06:39,890 --> 03:06:42,090
You're gonna be so good, okay?

3027
03:06:43,250 --> 03:06:45,770
I don't need... Actually, train a little bit more.

3028
03:06:45,870 --> 03:06:46,370
Oh my gosh.

3029
03:06:50,820 --> 03:06:52,060
Okay, big bucks.

3030
03:06:52,520 --> 03:06:53,320
Big bucks.

3031
03:06:53,460 --> 03:06:53,660
Alright.

3032
03:06:54,220 --> 03:06:54,920
Go into racing!

3033
03:06:55,180 --> 03:06:56,120
It's the Beginner's Cup.

3034
03:06:56,180 --> 03:06:57,040
How is it so difficult?

3035
03:06:59,300 --> 03:07:00,300
Go, Bloodloss!

3036
03:07:00,460 --> 03:07:00,720
Go!

3037
03:07:03,820 --> 03:07:04,940
Oh, and he's fast.

3038
03:07:05,240 --> 03:07:06,320
Oh, and he's fast.

3039
03:07:06,360 --> 03:07:06,920
Look at him go!

3040
03:07:07,240 --> 03:07:07,880
Oh my god!

3041
03:07:08,400 --> 03:07:10,320
Oh my god!

3042
03:07:10,320 --> 03:07:11,480
Yes!

3043
03:07:13,380 --> 03:07:14,340
Bloodloss!

3044
03:07:19,140 --> 03:07:20,560
Oh my gosh!

3045
03:07:20,640 --> 03:07:21,980
Win a worker race!

3046
03:07:22,860 --> 03:07:23,720
Let's go!

3047
03:07:24,660 --> 03:07:26,320
Easy win.

3048
03:07:28,640 --> 03:07:30,000
Entry fee.

3049
03:07:30,700 --> 03:07:30,940
What?

3050
03:07:30,980 --> 03:07:33,280
There's obstacles in other ones?

3051
03:07:33,380 --> 03:07:34,360
Oh, there's sand.

3052
03:07:35,240 --> 03:07:36,880
And water and wind.

3053
03:07:36,880 --> 03:07:41,840
Oh no, Anya just died in the casino.

3054
03:07:42,840 --> 03:07:44,800
Pato just died in the casino.

3055
03:07:46,280 --> 03:07:46,920
Redemption!

3056
03:07:49,240 --> 03:07:49,880
Redemption!

3057
03:07:50,320 --> 03:07:51,500
Mirror, welcome to membership.

3058
03:07:51,720 --> 03:07:52,920
Thank you so much.

3059
03:07:53,440 --> 03:07:54,300
Ducky, thanks for the gift.

3060
03:07:56,780 --> 03:07:57,680
Let's see.

3061
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:00,020
Champion's Cup.

3062
03:08:01,320 --> 03:08:03,220
He's not ready for these leagues, not yet.

3063
03:08:05,620 --> 03:08:07,800
In fact, I'm gonna do another race.

3064
03:08:08,160 --> 03:08:09,180
Make back my money.

3065
03:08:10,720 --> 03:08:11,640
Come on!

3066
03:08:13,320 --> 03:08:13,700
Go!

3067
03:08:13,940 --> 03:08:14,160
Go!

3068
03:08:14,620 --> 03:08:15,080
Bloodloss!

3069
03:08:15,280 --> 03:08:15,480
Go!

3070
03:08:15,700 --> 03:08:15,880
Go!

3071
03:08:16,340 --> 03:08:16,800
Bloodloss!

3072
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:17,180
Go!

3073
03:08:17,460 --> 03:08:17,620
Go!

3074
03:08:17,820 --> 03:08:18,520
You're the fastest!

3075
03:08:18,680 --> 03:08:19,280
You're the greatest!

3076
03:08:19,500 --> 03:08:22,820
I love watching the deadbeat just drop to the ground.

3077
03:08:23,060 --> 03:08:23,540
Oh my gosh!

3078
03:08:24,060 --> 03:08:25,740
The Takodachi is so small!

3079
03:08:28,820 --> 03:08:29,280
Win!

3080
03:08:29,380 --> 03:08:29,800
Win!

3081
03:08:29,920 --> 03:08:30,280
Win!

3082
03:08:30,280 --> 03:08:30,500
Win!

3083
03:08:30,700 --> 03:08:33,160
I can make so much money from this probably.

3084
03:08:33,440 --> 03:08:35,200
Actually, I only make 100 every time.

3085
03:08:38,480 --> 03:08:38,920
Alright.

3086
03:08:39,900 --> 03:08:40,820
Is he good enough?

3087
03:08:42,260 --> 03:08:43,260
I'll try a second.

3088
03:08:48,020 --> 03:08:50,160
He's still a little fast.

3089
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:51,720
Go Bloodloss!

3090
03:08:52,020 --> 03:08:52,020
Go!

3091
03:08:52,300 --> 03:08:53,080
Go Bloodloss!

3092
03:08:53,220 --> 03:08:53,400
Go!

3093
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:54,440
Bloodloss!

3094
03:08:54,700 --> 03:08:55,200
Oh my God!

3095
03:08:55,220 --> 03:08:55,540
Oh my God!

3096
03:08:55,600 --> 03:08:55,880
Oh my God!

3097
03:08:55,940 --> 03:08:56,220
Oh my God!

3098
03:08:57,960 --> 03:08:58,640
It's tight!

3099
03:08:58,820 --> 03:08:59,040
It's tight!

3100
03:08:59,040 --> 03:08:59,400
Yeah!

3101
03:09:04,130 --> 03:09:05,690
You can charge the running.

3102
03:09:05,770 --> 03:09:06,450
Wait, what do you mean?

3103
03:09:10,080 --> 03:09:11,780
You can use...

3104
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:14,780
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

3105
03:09:16,080 --> 03:09:18,380
You can press space for what?

3106
03:09:18,520 --> 03:09:23,060
You can shift for boost and space to recover stamina.

3107
03:09:25,080 --> 03:09:25,640
You can?

3108
03:09:27,860 --> 03:09:28,260
Hey!

3109
03:09:28,520 --> 03:09:29,980
Welcome to Wacker Race!

3110
03:09:30,340 --> 03:09:32,640
You can enter leagues of different races with one of your...

3111
03:09:34,620 --> 03:09:35,020
...wackers.

3112
03:09:35,400 --> 03:09:37,900
You can win a race and pay an entry fee up front.

3113
03:09:38,120 --> 03:09:40,780
Then cheer your worker and get first place or win a prize.

3114
03:09:40,860 --> 03:09:41,460
It's that simple.

3115
03:09:41,900 --> 03:09:44,500
Your worker will run or swim or that takes energy.

3116
03:09:44,660 --> 03:09:46,080
You can cheer your worker with space.

3117
03:09:46,700 --> 03:09:48,240
They'll rest to recover energy.

3118
03:09:48,960 --> 03:09:51,360
Or if they have enough energy, you can press shift and they'll sprint.

3119
03:09:51,680 --> 03:09:52,960
But that takes a lot of energy.

3120
03:09:52,960 --> 03:09:55,180
Whatever it takes to win first place.

3121
03:09:55,560 --> 03:09:58,120
If your worker is no good, you can train them to increase their stats.

3122
03:09:58,620 --> 03:10:00,820
Each worker can train...

3123
03:10:01,360 --> 03:10:03,440
Wait, each worker can training points.

3124
03:10:05,780 --> 03:10:07,160
Based on their current level.

3125
03:10:07,640 --> 03:10:09,280
Raise your worker's level to get more points.

3126
03:10:09,600 --> 03:10:10,720
Then you can decide how to...

3127
03:10:12,760 --> 03:10:13,720
I see.

3128
03:10:19,320 --> 03:10:22,100
But it also costs money to train them.

3129
03:10:22,820 --> 03:10:23,300
Craziness.

3130
03:10:26,140 --> 03:10:27,440
Wait, now I want to see.

3131
03:10:27,980 --> 03:10:29,300
Blood loss, win this time.

3132
03:10:29,400 --> 03:10:29,780
Okay, wait.

3133
03:10:32,020 --> 03:10:33,440
Oh, I see, I see.

3134
03:10:35,160 --> 03:10:36,460
Look, he is still faster.

3135
03:10:36,780 --> 03:10:39,660
Uh-oh, wait.

3136
03:10:40,420 --> 03:10:41,380
That might have been about it.

3137
03:10:41,600 --> 03:10:42,500
Rest, rest, rest.

3138
03:10:45,180 --> 03:10:45,600
Guys,

3139
03:10:51,650 --> 03:10:55,030
I did so much better without cheering on my guy.

3140
03:10:55,780 --> 03:10:58,150
This is why you don't backseat.

3141
03:11:01,130 --> 03:11:02,990
Yeah, maybe he was okay on his own.

3142
03:11:05,090 --> 03:11:06,130
He had blood loss.

3143
03:11:06,950 --> 03:11:08,830
No, the blood loss is others.

3144
03:11:10,130 --> 03:11:13,310
They made a sport just like this that you can bet on.

3145
03:11:13,410 --> 03:11:14,410
It's called horse racing.

3146
03:11:14,530 --> 03:11:17,070
And it's based on Uma Musume.

3147
03:11:19,470 --> 03:11:20,450
Oh, wow.

3148
03:11:21,030 --> 03:11:22,310
Horse racing, yes.

3149
03:11:22,310 --> 03:11:25,630
Uma Musume goes back thousands of years.

3150
03:11:45,070 --> 03:11:48,850
Tell my kids this is Uma Musume.

3151
03:11:51,710 --> 03:11:53,370
What about... I didn't do the roulette either.

3152
03:11:53,370 --> 03:11:55,150
Oh my gosh, there is so much to do.

3153
03:11:55,570 --> 03:11:57,510
Place your chips in any color slot.

3154
03:12:05,750 --> 03:12:07,730
You don't get so many though.

3155
03:12:13,160 --> 03:12:14,100
Oh, stop.

3156
03:12:20,500 --> 03:12:21,560
I won 20.

3157
03:12:22,360 --> 03:12:23,480
This one is boring.

3158
03:12:46,210 --> 03:12:48,170
Oh, it feels so good.

3159
03:13:02,660 --> 03:13:04,360
We didn't do this one either though.

3160
03:13:04,360 --> 03:13:05,820
The higher, lower.

3161
03:13:06,640 --> 03:13:07,520
Let's bet a thousand.

3162
03:13:07,800 --> 03:13:08,440
Confirm bet.

3163
03:13:12,850 --> 03:13:13,990
Lower?

3164
03:13:17,490 --> 03:13:18,630
Next round.

3165
03:13:23,270 --> 03:13:24,510
Lower.

3166
03:13:27,170 --> 03:13:29,010
Next round.

3167
03:13:30,570 --> 03:13:31,190
Higher.

3168
03:13:33,630 --> 03:13:35,210
Next round.

3169
03:13:36,110 --> 03:13:36,730
Higher.

3170
03:13:39,370 --> 03:13:40,450
Next round.

3171
03:13:42,310 --> 03:13:42,990
Higher.

3172
03:13:46,710 --> 03:13:52,530
Oh my god, I'm hitting big numbers, big numbers, big numbers.

3173
03:13:54,170 --> 03:13:56,130
At the casino, baby.

3174
03:13:57,010 --> 03:13:58,950
When do we get Minto and Vegas Arc?

3175
03:14:00,130 --> 03:14:00,970
I'm here.

3176
03:14:02,070 --> 03:14:03,030
I'm in Vegas.

3177
03:14:05,030 --> 03:14:05,690
No math?

3178
03:14:05,710 --> 03:14:06,850
I tried the math earlier.

3179
03:14:06,850 --> 03:14:06,930
Higher.

3180
03:14:10,290 --> 03:14:11,810
I'm gonna do normal.

3181
03:14:14,350 --> 03:14:15,130
Okay.

3182
03:14:24,410 --> 03:14:25,810
42.

3183
03:14:31,920 --> 03:14:33,320
2.

3184
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:43,280
7 times 4.

3185
03:14:45,440 --> 03:14:47,720
I don't know 7 times 4.

3186
03:14:48,160 --> 03:14:49,540
Wait, 28?

3187
03:14:53,360 --> 03:14:55,400
14, 21, 28.

3188
03:14:58,400 --> 03:14:59,600
Please, I'm scared.

3189
03:14:59,800 --> 03:15:00,280
Stop moving.

3190
03:15:04,400 --> 03:15:06,380
There's not a time limit, right?

3191
03:15:06,560 --> 03:15:08,200
So it's nice at least.

3192
03:15:08,880 --> 03:15:10,440
Wait, 6.

3193
03:15:11,100 --> 03:15:12,280
Carry the 1.

3194
03:15:13,160 --> 03:15:13,680
76.

3195
03:15:18,300 --> 03:15:19,240
Move, please.

3196
03:15:19,740 --> 03:15:21,500
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, I almost shot it.

3197
03:15:21,720 --> 03:15:22,240
Nice.

3198
03:15:25,060 --> 03:15:25,580
120?

3199
03:15:30,130 --> 03:15:32,810
4, 30, 34.

3200
03:15:33,810 --> 03:15:34,430
I'm over here.

3201
03:15:36,110 --> 03:15:39,030
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

3202
03:15:39,070 --> 03:15:42,890
Why does this feel like a goddamn Mario Party minigame?

3203
03:15:43,070 --> 03:15:43,450
Oh shoot.

3204
03:15:45,810 --> 03:15:47,010
Oh, come on.

3205
03:15:47,370 --> 03:15:48,130
Come on.

3206
03:15:48,630 --> 03:15:49,170
Come on.

3207
03:15:49,630 --> 03:15:50,190
Come on.

3208
03:15:51,850 --> 03:15:52,850
Nice, okay.

3209
03:15:54,410 --> 03:15:55,030
Daska!

3210
03:15:56,310 --> 03:15:57,270
Miss you too.

3211
03:15:59,130 --> 03:16:01,210
Send me more pictures of your feet.

3212
03:16:01,330 --> 03:16:02,470
I mean your dog.

3213
03:16:06,050 --> 03:16:08,030
Please ban Orca pretty please.

3214
03:16:08,230 --> 03:16:08,450
Okay.

3215
03:16:09,530 --> 03:16:10,870
Orca, come here.

3216
03:16:10,870 --> 03:16:10,970
Come here.

3217
03:16:13,430 --> 03:16:17,170
Mr. Broken Bon, thank you for the Orca Super, thank you.

3218
03:16:29,500 --> 03:16:30,820
Oh, wait.

3219
03:16:32,340 --> 03:16:34,000
4 times 18.

3220
03:16:36,640 --> 03:16:40,140
18, 18, plus 18.

3221
03:16:40,600 --> 03:16:41,100
6.

3222
03:16:43,430 --> 03:16:44,220
36, no.

3223
03:16:46,120 --> 03:16:47,840
Wait, 36.

3224
03:16:48,780 --> 03:16:49,340
Wait.

3225
03:16:50,500 --> 03:16:51,140
Wait, oh wait.

3226
03:16:51,540 --> 03:16:53,460
8 plus 8 is... wait.

3227
03:17:01,650 --> 03:17:04,430
But then it's 18 times 3.

3228
03:17:05,030 --> 03:17:07,670
Because we're dividing it by 4.

3229
03:17:08,050 --> 03:17:11,430
Wait, 18 times 4 divided by 4.

3230
03:17:11,930 --> 03:17:13,110
Isn't that just 18?

3231
03:17:15,350 --> 03:17:17,570
I didn't read the whole thing you guys, okay?

3232
03:17:18,450 --> 03:17:20,230
Okay, I only read the first part.

3233
03:17:21,930 --> 03:17:22,890
Come here.

3234
03:17:23,730 --> 03:17:24,490
Come here.

3235
03:17:24,830 --> 03:17:25,770
Come here.

3236
03:17:26,150 --> 03:17:27,770
This guy is trying to sabotage me.

3237
03:17:30,550 --> 03:17:32,330
Oops, I wasn't paying attention.

3238
03:17:32,670 --> 03:17:33,210
Okay, here we go.

3239
03:17:33,810 --> 03:17:34,370
Nice.

3240
03:17:39,950 --> 03:17:41,290
24, 24.

3241
03:17:44,050 --> 03:17:44,730
36.

3242
03:18:03,170 --> 03:18:05,090
7, 8, 9, 77.

3243
03:18:06,490 --> 03:18:10,550
Okay, 2 times...

3244
03:18:11,450 --> 03:18:12,550
2 times...

3245
03:18:13,290 --> 03:18:15,390
24, 24.

3246
03:18:18,090 --> 03:18:18,610
9!

3247
03:18:20,550 --> 03:18:21,310
Yeah!

3248
03:18:22,890 --> 03:18:25,030
Come here, come here, come here.

3249
03:18:25,570 --> 03:18:27,930
How hard do these math problems get?

3250
03:18:28,490 --> 03:18:30,390
Why are they trying to make us smarter?

3251
03:18:31,490 --> 03:18:33,470
48 divided by 8?

3252
03:18:43,150 --> 03:18:43,990
48?

3253
03:18:45,950 --> 03:18:47,870
Is it 6 or 4?

3254
03:18:53,150 --> 03:18:55,170
It's basic math, Minto.

3255
03:18:55,330 --> 03:18:57,450
I didn't go to math class!

3256
03:18:58,730 --> 03:18:59,550
6?

3257
03:19:01,270 --> 03:19:01,970
It's 6?

3258
03:19:09,400 --> 03:19:12,760
I missed all of my elementary math classes.

3259
03:19:15,120 --> 03:19:16,080
Ah...

3260
03:19:20,270 --> 03:19:21,230
How?

3261
03:19:27,710 --> 03:19:28,670
Basically...

3262
03:19:28,670 --> 03:19:32,090
I had to go to a special program at my school.

3263
03:19:32,790 --> 03:19:37,210
But the special program always took place during the...

3264
03:19:40,710 --> 03:19:42,630
During the...

3265
03:19:43,350 --> 03:19:44,530
Math class.

3266
03:19:44,970 --> 03:19:46,430
It was for...

3267
03:19:47,430 --> 03:19:51,630
It was for students with troubled homes, okay?

3268
03:20:04,250 --> 03:20:06,530
That's why I'm bad at math!

3269
03:20:12,630 --> 03:20:14,630
Oh gosh...

3270
03:20:16,170 --> 03:20:18,650
34 divided by 2.

3271
03:20:29,570 --> 03:20:30,170
17?

3272
03:20:33,210 --> 03:20:33,810
17?

3273
03:20:34,810 --> 03:20:35,270
Right?

3274
03:20:36,230 --> 03:20:36,970
Come on!

3275
03:20:40,010 --> 03:20:40,610
Oh

3276
03:20:44,090 --> 03:20:44,370
no!

3277
03:20:44,670 --> 03:20:44,910
Wait!

3278
03:20:47,050 --> 03:20:48,290
48, right?

3279
03:20:49,930 --> 03:20:51,310
That's the highest number here.

3280
03:20:51,390 --> 03:20:52,030
It's gotta be.

3281
03:20:57,520 --> 03:21:01,180
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40...

3282
03:21:01,180 --> 03:21:02,440
And I was 5.

3283
03:21:02,440 --> 03:21:04,640
Oh, there it is in the corner.

3284
03:21:04,980 --> 03:21:05,500
Nice.

3285
03:21:06,480 --> 03:21:06,800
Yay!

3286
03:21:08,360 --> 03:21:09,080
That's so sad.

3287
03:21:09,160 --> 03:21:10,060
Can we get 20 gifted?

3288
03:21:10,320 --> 03:21:10,840
No!

3289
03:21:17,360 --> 03:21:17,880
Yippee!

3290
03:21:23,080 --> 03:21:25,740
Minto is taking HoloCure for math credits.

3291
03:21:28,920 --> 03:21:30,640
I had the same thing in school.

3292
03:21:30,740 --> 03:21:32,060
That's why I'm bad at math.

3293
03:21:32,620 --> 03:21:34,280
It was yours during math class too!

3294
03:21:34,280 --> 03:21:35,200
Perfect!

3295
03:21:35,400 --> 03:21:36,240
Oh my gosh, perfect.

3296
03:21:36,440 --> 03:21:36,680
Stop!

3297
03:21:38,000 --> 03:21:39,300
Thank you for the 20 gifted.

3298
03:21:41,200 --> 03:21:41,680
Yay!

3299
03:21:44,740 --> 03:21:45,220
Yay!

3300
03:21:46,020 --> 03:21:46,740
We did math.

3301
03:21:46,840 --> 03:21:48,460
I did the normal math, you guys.

3302
03:21:49,340 --> 03:21:50,820
How far does this get?

3303
03:21:51,300 --> 03:21:53,500
So endless... Oh, it's just infinity questions.

3304
03:21:54,060 --> 03:21:56,600
But challenge is probably even harder questions, right?

3305
03:21:57,980 --> 03:22:02,600
Is there things like squared and...

3306
03:22:03,600 --> 03:22:06,560
What if there's Pythagorean theorems in there?

3307
03:22:08,940 --> 03:22:10,200
You want to challenge yourself?

3308
03:22:10,880 --> 03:22:12,600
But the payout...

3309
03:22:14,580 --> 03:22:17,160
I've sung the alphabet and forgot what comes next.

3310
03:22:19,160 --> 03:22:22,060
If you say that you have to eat a dog, they get elemental pee.

3311
03:22:27,670 --> 03:22:29,830
The scaling of endless is just too much.

3312
03:22:31,990 --> 03:22:34,050
There's time limit in endless.

3313
03:22:34,490 --> 03:22:34,830
No!

3314
03:22:37,910 --> 03:22:38,790
Hell no.

3315
03:22:39,510 --> 03:22:40,030
So sad.

3316
03:22:40,110 --> 03:22:40,830
Can we get a...

3317
03:22:42,330 --> 03:22:43,930
Thank you for the bed!

3318
03:22:44,330 --> 03:22:44,570
Meow!

3319
03:22:45,010 --> 03:22:45,990
Meow, thank you!

3320
03:22:46,610 --> 03:22:47,410
Hello, hello.

3321
03:22:47,410 --> 03:22:48,290
Welcome back!

3322
03:22:49,690 --> 03:22:53,850
I forgot to say welcome back to everybody at the beginning of the stream.

3323
03:22:54,010 --> 03:22:57,030
Because I was so mad about everything.

3324
03:22:57,670 --> 03:22:58,750
About my feelings.

3325
03:22:59,150 --> 03:23:00,430
Thank you for the 20!

3326
03:23:01,270 --> 03:23:02,690
Thank you for the 5!

3327
03:23:04,350 --> 03:23:06,350
I started the Tower of Suffering when you started the stream.

3328
03:23:06,450 --> 03:23:08,290
I'm stuck at 67%.

3329
03:23:11,590 --> 03:23:13,750
So you really have been going at it for 3 hours.

3330
03:23:16,150 --> 03:23:17,510
Let's go try it too.

3331
03:23:18,550 --> 03:23:21,730
Oops, I think I just saw Pekora cry and leave.

3332
03:23:27,250 --> 03:23:30,050
Sometimes the music is a little too much for me.

3333
03:23:30,630 --> 03:23:32,790
It's nice to just have a little break.

3334
03:23:33,010 --> 03:23:34,010
Thank you for the 20!

3335
03:23:34,950 --> 03:23:36,410
Thank you for the 5!

3336
03:23:36,610 --> 03:23:37,650
Thank you guys.

3337
03:23:44,540 --> 03:23:46,000
The casino music.

3338
03:23:46,000 --> 03:23:46,560
Yeah!

3339
03:23:52,500 --> 03:23:54,040
I should thank you for the 5, captain.

3340
03:23:58,920 --> 03:24:02,120
It took me 7 and a half hours to beat the tower.

3341
03:24:03,860 --> 03:24:05,540
Thank you for the 20!

3342
03:24:06,860 --> 03:24:08,400
7 and a half hours?

3343
03:24:08,800 --> 03:24:10,380
Has the game even been out that long?

3344
03:24:11,020 --> 03:24:11,740
Oh, I guess so.

3345
03:24:14,460 --> 03:24:16,400
I got to 4%.

3346
03:24:16,980 --> 03:24:17,660
I think?

3347
03:24:18,480 --> 03:24:19,920
I'm at 1%.

3348
03:24:20,480 --> 03:24:21,740
Oh my goodness.

3349
03:24:23,480 --> 03:24:26,120
Holy cow, I'm already at 2%.

3350
03:24:31,730 --> 03:24:33,510
Back to 2%.

3351
03:24:34,450 --> 03:24:35,650
Can never escape.

3352
03:24:36,630 --> 03:24:37,170
3%.

3353
03:24:37,170 --> 03:24:39,650
Oh, back to 2%.

3354
03:24:40,650 --> 03:24:42,190
Shady, thank you for the 50!

3355
03:24:44,270 --> 03:24:45,940
I've never been good at...

3356
03:24:46,470 --> 03:24:48,070
So did Callie beat this then?

3357
03:24:48,130 --> 03:24:49,390
I've never been good at Jump King.

3358
03:24:55,540 --> 03:24:55,940
4%.

3359
03:24:56,380 --> 03:24:58,060
I can see the 4% happening.

3360
03:24:58,160 --> 03:24:58,660
See you guys.

3361
03:25:01,720 --> 03:25:02,120
4%.

3362
03:25:03,220 --> 03:25:03,620
Nice.

3363
03:25:04,900 --> 03:25:05,840
It's so hard.

3364
03:25:06,460 --> 03:25:07,580
Yeah, but there is a hot babe.

3365
03:25:07,860 --> 03:25:09,200
And this one says there is a cute girl.

3366
03:25:09,920 --> 03:25:10,740
Who is it?

3367
03:25:10,780 --> 03:25:11,800
Who is the cute girl?

3368
03:25:11,940 --> 03:25:12,340
I wonder.

3369
03:25:26,040 --> 03:25:28,000
It's a mirror, so I was right, huh?

3370
03:25:28,980 --> 03:25:29,680
Oh!

3371
03:25:31,420 --> 03:25:35,480
I don't like watching my Oshie fall to her face.

3372
03:25:36,960 --> 03:25:38,780
You know, it's so sad.

3373
03:25:39,580 --> 03:25:42,620
Watching my Oshie fall flat on her face.

3374
03:25:43,880 --> 03:25:45,060
So sad.

3375
03:25:47,360 --> 03:25:49,460
The cute girl is at the bottom right of the screen.

3376
03:26:01,970 --> 03:26:02,470
Nice.

3377
03:26:04,330 --> 03:26:05,030
Nice.

3378
03:26:06,570 --> 03:26:07,270
Nice.

3379
03:26:10,680 --> 03:26:12,000
Not nice.

3380
03:26:17,040 --> 03:26:18,380
My right.

3381
03:26:23,170 --> 03:26:25,010
Bottom left even better.

3382
03:26:45,300 --> 03:26:47,400
Balthazar, thanks for the gifted.

3383
03:26:47,720 --> 03:26:48,840
Thank you!

3384
03:27:09,450 --> 03:27:11,870
They meant the bottom of the screen.

3385
03:27:16,000 --> 03:27:18,500
Oh my gosh, I'm so glad I have my pants on today.

3386
03:27:19,200 --> 03:27:20,900
Holy cow, that would have been bad.

3387
03:27:26,790 --> 03:27:28,370
Centered as all things should be.

3388
03:27:36,240 --> 03:27:38,900
Do you get a buff if you play as Callie in this?

3389
03:27:38,960 --> 03:27:39,300
I wonder.

3390
03:27:42,080 --> 03:27:42,480
Oops.

3391
03:27:44,360 --> 03:27:46,320
Why didn't it...

3392
03:27:47,780 --> 03:27:48,180
Nice.

3393
03:27:51,430 --> 03:27:53,010
Now I can't see the rest of the level.

3394
03:27:56,210 --> 03:27:59,050
Cute girl keeps moving around the screen edges.

3395
03:28:09,220 --> 03:28:10,820
It's you guys.

3396
03:28:11,220 --> 03:28:12,920
You guys are the cute girl.

3397
03:28:16,000 --> 03:28:17,740
Chat's the cute girl.

3398
03:28:21,020 --> 03:28:22,700
Chat's the cute girl.

3399
03:28:28,340 --> 03:28:29,160
Oh!

3400
03:28:29,540 --> 03:28:29,800
Oops.

3401
03:28:32,020 --> 03:28:32,840
Oops.

3402
03:28:39,870 --> 03:28:41,390
I wish I was a cute girl.

3403
03:28:41,490 --> 03:28:43,090
Don't we all wish we were cute girls?

3404
03:28:43,190 --> 03:28:43,550
Come on.

3405
03:28:44,830 --> 03:28:46,610
There would be world peace.

3406
03:28:48,570 --> 03:28:49,610
If so...

3407
03:28:49,610 --> 03:28:50,490
Oh my gosh.

3408
03:28:51,270 --> 03:28:52,390
I did it before.

3409
03:28:52,570 --> 03:28:53,930
I don't remember how I did it.

3410
03:28:57,950 --> 03:28:59,050
Go back this way.

3411
03:29:01,730 --> 03:29:03,990
That's why we need more Moe everybody.

3412
03:29:04,990 --> 03:29:06,390
Moe is justice.

3413
03:29:07,050 --> 03:29:09,270
And Moe will bring world peace.

3414
03:29:10,890 --> 03:29:11,890
Moe.

3415
03:29:16,090 --> 03:29:22,150
Moe will make every heart tender and lovely.

3416
03:29:23,650 --> 03:29:26,970
I am the bringer of Moe.

3417
03:29:31,710 --> 03:29:35,250
I appreciate the double song from the other day.

3418
03:29:35,250 --> 03:29:40,250
But can I get a happy birthday song from Mature Minto since today is my actual birthday.

3419
03:29:42,890 --> 03:29:44,030
Mature Minto.

3420
03:29:47,170 --> 03:29:51,130
Like a happy birthday Mr. President kind of mature.

3421
03:29:56,250 --> 03:29:57,770
Like a...

3422
03:29:59,270 --> 03:30:04,450
I swallowed my spit rock.

3423
03:30:09,080 --> 03:30:09,600
Okay.

3424
03:30:12,920 --> 03:30:13,960
Mature Minto.

3425
03:30:16,760 --> 03:30:19,440
Someone said am I even capable of being mature.

3426
03:30:19,960 --> 03:30:20,920
I am mature.

3427
03:30:21,880 --> 03:30:22,860
I'm mature.

3428
03:30:28,680 --> 03:30:29,200
Okay.

3429
03:30:29,200 --> 03:30:29,720
Wait.

3430
03:30:30,420 --> 03:30:30,760
Oh gosh.

3431
03:30:30,840 --> 03:30:31,820
I haven't done it in so long.

3432
03:30:31,900 --> 03:30:32,440
It's so weird.

3433
03:30:32,520 --> 03:30:32,660
Okay.

3434
03:30:32,660 --> 03:30:32,740
Okay.

3435
03:30:34,500 --> 03:30:41,820
This is a happy birthday for S810 Ritual on your birthday.

3436
03:30:52,440 --> 03:30:56,380
Happy birthday to you.

3437
03:30:56,840 --> 03:31:00,960
Happy birthday to you.

3438
03:31:01,860 --> 03:31:03,960
Happy birthday...

3439
03:31:05,960 --> 03:31:13,080
Mr. President of S810 Ritual.

3440
03:31:13,920 --> 03:31:18,760
Happy birthday to you.

3441
03:31:22,530 --> 03:31:24,130
Thanks for the aqua soup.

3442
03:31:28,000 --> 03:31:29,760
Mr. President.

3443
03:31:29,760 --> 03:31:30,000
Mr. President.

3444
03:31:34,120 --> 03:31:35,280
George Sears.

3445
03:31:44,600 --> 03:31:46,260
Ara ara voice returns.

3446
03:31:46,440 --> 03:31:47,040
Ara ara.

3447
03:31:48,080 --> 03:31:49,160
Ara ara.

3448
03:31:49,340 --> 03:31:51,280
My voice is always suitable for the ara ara.

3449
03:31:51,420 --> 03:31:52,660
What are you talking about everybody?

3450
03:31:54,080 --> 03:31:55,440
What if I bounce?

3451
03:31:56,380 --> 03:31:56,960
Bounce.

3452
03:31:57,220 --> 03:31:57,720
Nice!

3453
03:32:06,360 --> 03:32:07,280
Ara ara.

3454
03:32:11,130 --> 03:32:14,150
Are you cute because you are Minto or are you Minto because you are cute?

3455
03:32:16,070 --> 03:32:17,530
I'm going back in the middle.

3456
03:32:19,810 --> 03:32:21,210
I think it brought me good luck.

3457
03:32:49,350 --> 03:32:49,810
See?

3458
03:32:57,240 --> 03:32:58,660
How do I make this?

3459
03:32:59,460 --> 03:33:00,680
Maybe I stand here.

3460
03:33:00,780 --> 03:33:02,040
Maybe this is a clue.

3461
03:33:02,760 --> 03:33:03,900
Right here is a hint.

3462
03:33:04,660 --> 03:33:05,720
Can you do a frog burp?

3463
03:33:05,880 --> 03:33:06,340
Ara ara.

3464
03:33:20,960 --> 03:33:27,940
I can feel my blood pressure rising as I play this jump game.

3465
03:33:28,660 --> 03:33:29,540
Yeah.

3466
03:33:30,080 --> 03:33:30,880
I know.

3467
03:33:31,880 --> 03:33:32,820
Me too.

3468
03:33:33,840 --> 03:33:34,920
I have no blood.

3469
03:33:35,400 --> 03:33:36,260
Ectoplasm.

3470
03:33:36,560 --> 03:33:38,460
My ectoplasm is rising.

3471
03:33:40,880 --> 03:33:42,320
That was perfect.

3472
03:33:43,860 --> 03:33:45,040
And so will this jump!

3473
03:33:47,200 --> 03:33:48,620
Ara ara.

3474
03:33:50,740 --> 03:33:51,960
Ara ara.

3475
03:33:52,780 --> 03:33:53,780
On the wall.

3476
03:33:54,660 --> 03:33:57,460
Who is the froggiest of them all?

3477
03:33:58,660 --> 03:33:59,280
It's me.

3478
03:34:01,180 --> 03:34:06,140
I'm not a real frog even though there is a froggy wawa right here.

3479
03:34:06,220 --> 03:34:07,400
I'm not a froggy.

3480
03:34:08,720 --> 03:34:09,820
Froggy time.

3481
03:34:09,980 --> 03:34:12,420
I'm jumping through the jump key.

3482
03:34:12,660 --> 03:34:13,940
It's just like a frog would.

3483
03:34:15,020 --> 03:34:18,940
Where is a froggy wawa outfit for this level?

3484
03:34:19,280 --> 03:34:19,860
Oh my god.

3485
03:34:19,920 --> 03:34:21,620
I can't get it.

3486
03:34:23,200 --> 03:34:24,240
D'oh.

3487
03:34:27,180 --> 03:34:29,960
What does Frogbert think of the femnani sensation?

3488
03:34:30,200 --> 03:34:32,680
Why couldn't you do it to Frogbert?

3489
03:34:34,440 --> 03:34:38,300
I think it would've been really sexy if it were me instead.

3490
03:34:38,400 --> 03:34:39,180
I'm just saying.

3491
03:34:40,700 --> 03:34:45,340
I mean, you can't even sex me up anymore than I already am though.

3492
03:34:45,340 --> 03:34:45,820
No!

3493
03:34:46,480 --> 03:34:50,780
That was

3494
03:35:06,450 --> 03:35:08,070
disgusting, wasn't it?

3495
03:35:15,490 --> 03:35:18,090
Frogbert is the sex symbol.

3496
03:35:18,830 --> 03:35:19,390
Absolutely.

3497
03:35:22,570 --> 03:35:23,710
No!

3498
03:35:27,860 --> 03:35:28,160
No!

3499
03:35:28,720 --> 03:35:29,240
No!

3500
03:35:30,040 --> 03:35:31,440
My god!

3501
03:35:32,580 --> 03:35:35,340
I don't know my own strength.

3502
03:35:39,860 --> 03:35:41,660
Any chance of...

3503
03:35:41,660 --> 03:35:44,140
Hey, you're doing alright, Ojisanma?

3504
03:35:45,620 --> 03:35:48,380
Voice pack for us old folks.

3505
03:35:48,520 --> 03:35:51,500
I'm doing okay, but honestly life just isn't that nice to us sometimes.

3506
03:35:53,320 --> 03:35:54,900
Thank you for the Haka Super!

3507
03:35:55,860 --> 03:35:58,940
Oh, I do want to do some voice packs.

3508
03:36:02,260 --> 03:36:04,900
What would you want for me to say?

3509
03:36:05,100 --> 03:36:09,180
Some motivating things for Goshijin-sama, Ojisanma?

3510
03:36:13,840 --> 03:36:16,180
It's hard for me to motivate though.

3511
03:36:17,240 --> 03:36:18,860
I mean, I'm just a ghost.

3512
03:36:19,480 --> 03:36:20,160
How do I motivate?

3513
03:36:20,260 --> 03:36:23,540
When I have no life, how do I motivate you for your life?

3514
03:36:23,980 --> 03:36:24,700
You know what I mean?

3515
03:36:25,500 --> 03:36:25,780
Oops.

3516
03:36:28,400 --> 03:36:30,900
How do I motivate you if I have no life?

3517
03:36:31,700 --> 03:36:32,820
I only have afterlife.

3518
03:36:41,950 --> 03:36:44,410
Solid Snake's speech at the end of MGS2.

3519
03:36:45,370 --> 03:36:47,730
That was so good.

3520
03:36:48,570 --> 03:36:51,530
My car wouldn't let me charge for the last six attempts.

3521
03:36:51,710 --> 03:36:51,870
No!

3522
03:36:53,790 --> 03:36:54,790
Please stop!

3523
03:36:54,890 --> 03:36:57,290
I think your bank is trying to tell you something.

3524
03:36:58,010 --> 03:37:01,190
Lure us to your maid cafe and then take our souls.

3525
03:37:04,550 --> 03:37:07,330
We're suckers for positive affirmations, huh?

3526
03:37:11,750 --> 03:37:13,110
Positive affirmations.

3527
03:37:13,650 --> 03:37:15,230
Positive affirmations.

3528
03:37:15,450 --> 03:37:16,610
Positive affirmations.

3529
03:37:29,970 --> 03:37:40,710
I think the most telling sign of you doing well is if a ghost tells you you're doing well.

3530
03:37:40,870 --> 03:37:47,990
Because, you know, I could just be like, you know, I'm dead.

3531
03:37:48,710 --> 03:37:49,230
I...

3532
03:37:54,870 --> 03:38:00,250
You could just be dead, but I'm a ghost and I'm telling you that you're doing a good job, you know?

3533
03:38:03,430 --> 03:38:05,690
Ghosts are the most unbiased creatures.

3534
03:38:07,750 --> 03:38:09,330
I wouldn't say that.

3535
03:38:11,930 --> 03:38:14,850
Tell us you'll fill our dark soul with light.

3536
03:38:18,870 --> 03:38:20,270
I...

3537
03:38:24,650 --> 03:38:27,450
I think...

3538
03:38:29,810 --> 03:38:31,990
I think...

3539
03:38:32,610 --> 03:38:39,130
I think...

3540
03:38:39,130 --> 03:38:41,990
This world and...

3541
03:38:42,990 --> 03:38:44,970
The afterlife...

3542
03:38:44,970 --> 03:38:47,990
The living life and the afterlife are both very big.

3543
03:38:48,090 --> 03:38:50,230
They're basically... They're almost probably the same.

3544
03:38:53,410 --> 03:38:54,730
And still...

3545
03:38:54,730 --> 03:38:58,970
In this hustle and bustle world...

3546
03:38:59,530 --> 03:39:06,670
You were able to find our little community and I think that's honestly something so special.

3547
03:39:07,230 --> 03:39:09,970
You know, I think that...

3548
03:39:11,910 --> 03:39:14,970
Taking time for yourself is...

3549
03:39:15,670 --> 03:39:22,970
And being able to just hang out with us and relax and everything is...

3550
03:39:25,410 --> 03:39:27,330
You know, a really good time.

3551
03:39:28,530 --> 03:39:30,970
It's good self-care for you and...

3552
03:39:32,810 --> 03:39:37,350
I think that if things do get too tough...

3553
03:39:37,350 --> 03:39:42,830
If things are also hard, you can always at least count on, you know...

3554
03:39:42,830 --> 03:39:45,810
The community being here for you and me being here for you.

3555
03:39:45,950 --> 03:39:49,850
And there's always gonna be a MintoStream to help you feel better.

3556
03:39:50,050 --> 03:39:52,650
You know, I think...

3557
03:39:52,650 --> 03:39:56,350
I think every day how...

3558
03:39:58,430 --> 03:40:06,210
I guess how grateful I am that, you know, there's so many VTubers you could watch and you're here watching me.

3559
03:40:08,610 --> 03:40:09,130
And...

3560
03:40:10,730 --> 03:40:11,250
How...

3561
03:40:11,250 --> 03:40:16,410
Out of all the billions and billions and billions of people in the world...

3562
03:40:17,130 --> 03:40:19,230
Or ghosts in the afterworld...

3563
03:40:19,230 --> 03:40:23,290
How we all were able to kind of find each other.

3564
03:40:23,430 --> 03:40:28,350
And so if you're ever just like, I'm feeling kind of lonely, like...

3565
03:40:30,230 --> 03:40:35,490
Honestly, it's almost like short of a miracle that we were all able to find each other.

3566
03:40:36,630 --> 03:40:37,430
So...

3567
03:40:44,090 --> 03:40:45,570
It's pretty fun.

3568
03:40:55,720 --> 03:40:58,640
So hopefully even when you're just like...

3569
03:41:00,260 --> 03:41:03,980
The tough times, just remember...

3570
03:41:03,980 --> 03:41:05,400
Tough time never last.

3571
03:41:06,260 --> 03:41:07,660
Only tough people last.

3572
03:41:11,260 --> 03:41:12,060
Wait,

3573
03:41:16,830 --> 03:41:18,050
can I show you guys those?

3574
03:41:18,670 --> 03:41:21,110
Hold on, I think I know where they're at.

3575
03:41:21,410 --> 03:41:22,830
I think I know where I saved them.

3576
03:41:23,890 --> 03:41:24,210
What?

3577
03:41:24,470 --> 03:41:25,590
Oh, my bad.

3578
03:41:27,010 --> 03:41:27,690
One second.

3579
03:41:28,570 --> 03:41:29,330
Under here.

3580
03:41:30,590 --> 03:41:30,930
What?

3581
03:41:31,610 --> 03:41:33,070
Where did I save this?

3582
03:41:34,030 --> 03:41:35,150
Motivational misspeech.

3583
03:41:38,530 --> 03:41:40,710
Thank you for the Akasupodoes.

3584
03:41:42,010 --> 03:41:43,190
Thank you, thank you.

3585
03:41:43,910 --> 03:41:45,310
Where do I have it saved?

3586
03:41:45,310 --> 03:41:48,050
I found it literally just the other day.

3587
03:41:53,360 --> 03:41:54,980
Where did I keep it?

3588
03:41:55,500 --> 03:41:56,200
Maybe here?

3589
03:41:57,760 --> 03:41:58,080
No.

3590
03:41:59,480 --> 03:42:00,080
Here?

3591
03:42:00,380 --> 03:42:00,800
No.

3592
03:42:01,220 --> 03:42:01,520
Here?

3593
03:42:02,600 --> 03:42:03,200
No.

3594
03:42:03,820 --> 03:42:05,860
I just found it like the other day.

3595
03:42:06,000 --> 03:42:07,240
I found it!

3596
03:42:07,500 --> 03:42:10,300
OK, you guys, these are my motivational quotes.

3597
03:42:12,660 --> 03:42:13,660
Is this me?

3598
03:42:13,700 --> 03:42:14,020
Hold on.

3599
03:42:14,940 --> 03:42:16,380
I have to listen real quick.

3600
03:42:19,900 --> 03:42:21,360
Oh, I think this is all of them.

3601
03:42:22,600 --> 03:42:24,400
OK, OK, we're going to watch these together.

3602
03:42:26,900 --> 03:42:28,080
We're going to watch these together.

3603
03:42:28,480 --> 03:42:30,340
Hold on, I'm going to put it on, but I'm going to pause it.

3604
03:42:30,640 --> 03:42:31,180
Pause, pause, pause.

3605
03:42:31,380 --> 03:42:32,260
I want to hear it too.

3606
03:42:34,780 --> 03:42:35,600
OK, hold on.

3607
03:42:36,360 --> 03:42:36,840
Hold on.

3608
03:42:44,540 --> 03:42:44,900
OK.

3609
03:42:45,660 --> 03:42:46,020
OK.

3610
03:42:46,540 --> 03:42:47,200
Here we go.

3611
03:42:48,920 --> 03:42:49,580
Here we go.

3612
03:42:49,580 --> 03:42:49,640
Here we go.

3613
03:42:50,360 --> 03:42:54,320
These are the motivational quotes to really learn and live by.

3614
03:42:54,880 --> 03:42:57,400
I'm dead, but I can still live by them too.

3615
03:42:57,740 --> 03:42:58,520
OK, here we go.

3616
03:42:59,140 --> 03:42:59,740
Here we go.

3617
03:43:00,640 --> 03:43:01,760
Let me start it over.

3618
03:43:04,200 --> 03:43:05,780
Tough times never last.

3619
03:43:07,580 --> 03:43:08,900
Only tough people last.

3620
03:43:13,720 --> 03:43:16,240
Life is a very difficult exam.

3621
03:43:17,170 --> 03:43:21,000
Many people are failing because they want to copy from others.

3622
03:43:21,040 --> 03:43:22,640
They want to copy from others.

3623
03:43:23,080 --> 03:43:26,860
Everyone has a different question paper.

3624
03:43:28,860 --> 03:43:36,040
Only the tallest tree has an experience of the roughest winds.

3625
03:43:45,020 --> 03:43:55,100
But the eagle flies higher above the clouds.

3626
03:44:14,700 --> 03:44:16,600
You guys feel so motivated.

3627
03:44:18,630 --> 03:44:18,980
No.

3628
03:44:28,080 --> 03:44:30,220
I love that video.

3629
03:44:32,280 --> 03:44:33,800
I love that video.

3630
03:44:35,980 --> 03:44:37,800
Truly a god amongst men.

3631
03:44:38,360 --> 03:44:39,660
Thank you Minto, just what I needed.

3632
03:44:50,300 --> 03:44:52,700
What is this frog?

3633
03:44:52,820 --> 03:44:53,620
What do you mean frog?

3634
03:44:54,700 --> 03:44:55,580
A little...

3635
03:44:58,940 --> 03:45:02,040
Only the eagle flies higher...

3636
03:45:02,040 --> 03:45:03,080
Wait, what is this one?

3637
03:45:03,560 --> 03:45:04,980
I think this one we already did.

3638
03:45:05,180 --> 03:45:05,900
Or is this a different one?

3639
03:45:06,380 --> 03:45:07,300
No, no, no.

3640
03:45:07,680 --> 03:45:08,560
There is more.

3641
03:45:08,900 --> 03:45:09,860
I have another video.

3642
03:45:11,280 --> 03:45:12,820
Pause, pause, pause.

3643
03:45:13,320 --> 03:45:14,280
Pause, pause, pause.

3644
03:45:19,750 --> 03:45:20,770
I have another one.

3645
03:45:22,970 --> 03:45:23,410
Play.

3646
03:45:24,370 --> 03:45:28,630
Never ever carry your mistakes or your past with you.

3647
03:45:29,350 --> 03:45:31,490
Place them under your feet.

3648
03:45:32,590 --> 03:45:37,690
So that you can use them as a stepping stone to rise above.

3649
03:45:55,290 --> 03:45:59,350
So good, so good, so good.

3650
03:45:59,770 --> 03:46:01,450
So good, so good, so good.

3651
03:46:03,110 --> 03:46:04,910
With that guys...

3652
03:46:04,910 --> 03:46:06,590
I think I'm good too.

3653
03:46:07,610 --> 03:46:08,470
I think I might...

3654
03:46:09,570 --> 03:46:10,510
Head out now.

3655
03:46:10,950 --> 03:46:12,350
I really needed this, thank you Minto.

3656
03:46:12,650 --> 03:46:13,210
You're welcome.

3657
03:46:22,250 --> 03:46:24,510
Alan Wake, I want to play Alan Wake.

3658
03:46:24,810 --> 03:46:25,310
I want to play...

3659
03:46:26,010 --> 03:46:27,450
Make Frogbert versions.

3660
03:46:27,630 --> 03:46:28,690
Oh, I should.

3661
03:46:29,850 --> 03:46:32,490
Maybe I can when I finally have the 3D.

3662
03:46:33,210 --> 03:46:36,910
I can make some real 3D versions.

3663
03:46:41,170 --> 03:46:43,570
Just keep calm and...

3664
03:46:45,410 --> 03:46:49,470
Can I marry my love maid, Lilac?

3665
03:46:50,470 --> 03:46:52,850
Lilac doesn't believe in marriage.

3666
03:46:53,370 --> 03:46:53,770
Sorry.

3667
03:46:53,770 --> 03:46:53,830
Sorry.

3668
03:47:00,850 --> 03:47:02,790
Full blown Minto version of this.

3669
03:47:02,850 --> 03:47:03,770
The first voice back.

3670
03:47:05,010 --> 03:47:07,030
After being a lurker since 1.0.

3671
03:47:07,290 --> 03:47:07,610
What?

3672
03:47:10,590 --> 03:47:12,310
Ashes, you've been around for that long?

3673
03:47:12,570 --> 03:47:13,150
My god.

3674
03:47:13,690 --> 03:47:14,130
Seriously?

3675
03:47:16,730 --> 03:47:20,010
Finally coming out of my shell and meeting Wisps was the best thing I've ever done.

3676
03:47:20,350 --> 03:47:21,810
I've been able to form amazing friendships.

3677
03:47:21,810 --> 03:47:23,030
Thanks to your community.

3678
03:47:23,130 --> 03:47:24,150
Thank you for everything.

3679
03:47:25,670 --> 03:47:26,250
True OG.

3680
03:47:26,730 --> 03:47:27,170
What?

3681
03:47:28,230 --> 03:47:29,630
I had no idea.

3682
03:47:32,090 --> 03:47:34,290
Ashes was a lurker this whole time.

3683
03:47:34,470 --> 03:47:35,490
From 1.0.

3684
03:47:37,590 --> 03:47:39,010
Thanks for sticking around.

3685
03:47:39,090 --> 03:47:40,250
I've been here forever, bro.

3686
03:47:40,470 --> 03:47:40,710
What?

3687
03:47:42,030 --> 03:47:42,990
That's crazy.

3688
03:47:46,890 --> 03:47:49,070
Some of us have been here a long time, Minto.

3689
03:47:49,070 --> 03:47:52,170
I recognize some of your names.

3690
03:47:55,580 --> 03:47:56,580
Craziness.

3691
03:47:57,220 --> 03:47:58,620
Absolute craziness.

3692
03:48:00,420 --> 03:48:02,680
Well, thank you guys for streaming today.

3693
03:48:03,720 --> 03:48:04,900
And Holocure.

3694
03:48:05,280 --> 03:48:05,900
And Blackjack.

3695
03:48:06,440 --> 03:48:12,640
Blackjack, Blackjack, Blackjack, Blackjack, Blackjack, Blackjack, Blackjack.

3696
03:48:12,640 --> 03:48:15,020
I want to find...

3697
03:48:15,020 --> 03:48:16,640
Can we...

3698
03:48:17,660 --> 03:48:20,040
Online Blackjack for everybody to play together.

3699
03:48:20,740 --> 03:48:22,320
I'll try and find it.

3700
03:48:24,900 --> 03:48:27,180
Maybe I'll marry a Minto Daki someday.

3701
03:48:30,220 --> 03:48:31,220
A Daki?

3702
03:48:31,660 --> 03:48:33,400
Have you guys seen those Daki Makuras?

3703
03:48:33,700 --> 03:48:34,520
I saw them.

3704
03:48:34,560 --> 03:48:35,940
I saw them somewhat recently.

3705
03:48:36,100 --> 03:48:38,660
Those Daki Makuras that have like the...

3706
03:48:38,660 --> 03:48:41,580
They're like Oppai Mousepads, but Daki Makura.

3707
03:48:41,580 --> 03:48:43,480
And they have the boobs sewed on them.

3708
03:48:44,080 --> 03:48:45,200
That's kind of crazy.

3709
03:48:48,440 --> 03:48:49,800
That's crazy.

3710
03:48:52,600 --> 03:48:54,260
Have you guys seen those?

3711
03:48:55,040 --> 03:48:56,100
They're pretty powerful.

3712
03:49:02,600 --> 03:49:04,960
I want a Minto Daki Makura.

3713
03:49:05,240 --> 03:49:06,100
It'll come out...

3714
03:49:07,680 --> 03:49:08,360
Soon.

3715
03:49:11,040 --> 03:49:11,720
TM.

3716
03:49:12,540 --> 03:49:14,720
As long... As well as...

3717
03:49:15,260 --> 03:49:16,720
As well as...

3718
03:49:17,920 --> 03:49:20,560
Well, the Daki Makura are pre-order.

3719
03:49:23,560 --> 03:49:23,920
The...

3720
03:49:24,780 --> 03:49:26,720
Plushies will be...

3721
03:49:27,380 --> 03:49:28,520
Are ready to order.

3722
03:49:30,060 --> 03:49:30,780
And...

3723
03:49:30,780 --> 03:49:32,400
The Legos are ready to order.

3724
03:49:37,490 --> 03:49:38,210
And...

3725
03:49:38,210 --> 03:49:39,890
Maybe some other stuff.

3726
03:49:42,970 --> 03:49:45,070
I can... Wait, I have the Daki Makura.

3727
03:49:46,170 --> 03:49:46,570
Somewhere.

3728
03:49:52,210 --> 03:49:54,050
Wait, I thought I had it in this folder.

3729
03:49:55,270 --> 03:49:56,010
Do I not?

3730
03:49:58,970 --> 03:50:01,650
Sorry, I'm so sleepy now.

3731
03:50:01,710 --> 03:50:03,110
Oh my gosh, it's almost 11 PM.

3732
03:50:03,630 --> 03:50:04,830
Wow, for me at least.

3733
03:50:06,630 --> 03:50:07,990
Mint Daki is going to be flat.

3734
03:50:08,090 --> 03:50:09,590
No, this is Isekai Minto.

3735
03:50:10,930 --> 03:50:12,880
It's Isekai Minto, so...

3736
03:50:13,510 --> 03:50:15,090
It's not...

3737
03:50:15,090 --> 03:50:16,810
Where did I save it?

3738
03:50:23,330 --> 03:50:25,890
I can't even show my own merch.

3739
03:50:33,250 --> 03:50:35,690
Wait, I know I sent it to this person.

3740
03:50:45,700 --> 03:50:47,280
Look at this.

3741
03:50:48,700 --> 03:50:50,160
These are the...

3742
03:50:50,160 --> 03:50:51,940
These are the...

3743
03:50:51,940 --> 03:50:53,560
The Legos.

3744
03:50:54,760 --> 03:50:57,840
Wait, how do I turn the picture?

3745
03:50:59,100 --> 03:51:00,300
Rotate, rotate, rotate.

3746
03:51:00,780 --> 03:51:01,320
Okay, save.

3747
03:51:02,280 --> 03:51:03,480
Wait, it didn't save.

3748
03:51:04,280 --> 03:51:05,440
Rotate, rotate, rotate.

3749
03:51:06,580 --> 03:51:07,180
Save.

3750
03:51:08,540 --> 03:51:09,680
It didn't save.

3751
03:51:09,800 --> 03:51:11,500
Okay, I'll just show you guys.

3752
03:51:15,080 --> 03:51:16,840
Why isn't it working?

3753
03:51:18,220 --> 03:51:20,660
Guys, I think my computer is frozen.

3754
03:51:24,860 --> 03:51:27,260
Guys, I think my computer is frozen.

3755
03:51:34,980 --> 03:51:38,140
I can't do anything in my downloads folder.

3756
03:51:38,840 --> 03:51:39,940
And I can't drag...

3757
03:51:39,940 --> 03:51:41,460
OBS is frozen!

3758
03:51:42,040 --> 03:51:42,660
Oh no!

3759
03:51:43,940 --> 03:51:46,900
Guys, I think OBS is frozen.

3760
03:51:48,100 --> 03:51:49,440
OBS is not responding.

3761
03:51:55,980 --> 03:51:59,840
Guys, I think this is a good time to end the stream.

3762
03:52:01,480 --> 03:52:03,080
Wait, let me test something.

3763
03:52:06,200 --> 03:52:07,420
I'm gonna go to the outro.

3764
03:52:08,400 --> 03:52:09,380
Maybe it'll work.

3765
03:52:09,880 --> 03:52:10,900
I can press the button.

3766
03:52:11,600 --> 03:52:13,380
Thank you guys for today's stream.

3767
03:52:13,520 --> 03:52:14,840
I really appreciate it.

3768
03:52:15,520 --> 03:52:16,860
I'll stream tomorrow.

3769
03:52:18,860 --> 03:52:19,420
Sometime.

3770
03:52:19,620 --> 03:52:21,840
And then I'll have an actual schedule for next week.

3771
03:52:26,560 --> 03:52:28,100
Thank you guys for the stream.

3772
03:52:29,060 --> 03:52:29,620
And...

3773
03:52:30,240 --> 03:52:31,380
Take care of yourselves.

3774
03:52:36,300 --> 03:52:36,860
And...

3775
03:52:43,430 --> 03:52:43,990
Yeah.

3776
03:52:50,190 --> 03:52:51,230
Keep being freaks.

3777
03:52:53,070 --> 03:52:54,490
Hopefully this works.

3778
03:52:54,850 --> 03:52:57,030
I'm gonna press the button and see if it transitions.

3779
03:53:04,790 --> 03:53:06,270
Did it work?

3780
03:53:12,810 --> 03:53:13,610
Did it work?

3781
03:53:13,870 --> 03:53:14,110
No?

3782
03:53:23,700 --> 03:53:25,260
OBS is not responding.

3783
03:53:27,240 --> 03:53:29,260
I might just have to end the stream.

3784
03:53:29,880 --> 03:53:31,120
With no ending.

3785
03:53:34,990 --> 03:53:35,890
Uh oh.

3786
03:53:36,270 --> 03:53:37,090
YouTube is frozen.

3787
03:53:39,050 --> 03:53:39,730
How

3788
03:53:47,630 --> 03:53:49,110
do I end the stream?

3789
03:53:50,310 --> 03:53:51,050
Wait, you guys...

3790
03:53:51,050 --> 03:53:52,490
Let me restart YouTube.

3791
03:53:54,610 --> 03:53:55,830
OBS hates us.

3792
03:53:59,510 --> 03:54:01,790
Should I do karaoke now?

3793
03:54:05,690 --> 03:54:07,210
If I close the game.

3794
03:54:07,290 --> 03:54:08,790
It shows up that I closed it.

3795
03:54:10,710 --> 03:54:11,910
Okay, let's do karaoke.

3796
03:54:12,130 --> 03:54:13,230
Until everything works again.

3797
03:54:18,350 --> 03:54:19,530
What should I sing?

3798
03:54:21,610 --> 03:54:22,810
What should I sing?

3799
03:54:23,190 --> 03:54:23,770
Alt F4?

3800
03:54:23,890 --> 03:54:24,890
No, but then...

3801
03:54:25,930 --> 03:54:27,970
I need to go to my ending screen.

3802
03:54:34,330 --> 03:54:35,630
What should I sing?

3803
03:54:43,680 --> 03:54:44,600
EN or JP?

3804
03:54:44,800 --> 03:54:45,100
EN.

3805
03:54:45,360 --> 03:54:47,160
YouTube is completely frozen for me.

3806
03:54:47,160 --> 03:54:47,980
What is happening?

3807
03:54:48,640 --> 03:54:51,160
I think my computer might be falling apart.

3808
03:54:55,400 --> 03:54:57,160
It's falling apart.

3809
03:55:01,000 --> 03:55:03,440
Did you guys see that new...

3810
03:55:03,440 --> 03:55:05,180
V Shoujo JP girls?

3811
03:55:05,340 --> 03:55:06,200
They're so cute.

3812
03:55:07,140 --> 03:55:08,260
They're so cute.

3813
03:55:08,580 --> 03:55:11,640
Sorry, I just saw that there was a trailer for them on...

3814
03:55:11,640 --> 03:55:12,780
My For You page.

3815
03:55:15,860 --> 03:55:16,340
Karaoke.

3816
03:55:19,800 --> 03:55:21,420
I like the girl with the hammer.

3817
03:55:22,400 --> 03:55:22,840
What's her name?

3818
03:55:22,920 --> 03:55:23,160
Peke?

3819
03:55:24,100 --> 03:55:25,160
Peke is Peek.

3820
03:55:25,940 --> 03:55:26,980
She's so cute.

3821
03:55:33,640 --> 03:55:34,440
Hold on.

3822
03:55:35,040 --> 03:55:35,440
You know what?

3823
03:55:35,480 --> 03:55:36,740
Maybe there will be no ending.

3824
03:55:36,920 --> 03:55:38,000
Okay, I'll do one song.

3825
03:55:38,160 --> 03:55:39,860
I'll do one song.

3826
03:55:39,860 --> 03:55:41,980
Great Balls of Fire.

3827
03:55:42,640 --> 03:55:44,480
I don't know how it goes.

3828
03:55:53,310 --> 03:55:54,390
Will this work?

3829
03:55:57,740 --> 03:55:58,440
Will this work?

3830
03:56:19,200 --> 03:56:20,860
I've changed my mind.

3831
03:56:21,040 --> 03:56:22,280
This love is fine.

3832
03:56:22,420 --> 03:56:23,700
Goodness gracious.

3833
03:56:23,800 --> 03:56:25,260
Great Balls of Fire.

3834
03:56:25,880 --> 03:56:26,800
Kiss me baby.

3835
03:56:30,160 --> 03:56:31,280
Feels good.

3836
03:56:31,760 --> 03:56:32,660
Help me baby.

3837
03:56:32,820 --> 03:56:34,280
I don't know this song at all.

3838
03:56:34,540 --> 03:56:37,180
I want to love you like a lover should.

3839
03:56:37,900 --> 03:56:38,860
You're fine.

3840
03:56:39,140 --> 03:56:40,240
So kind.

3841
03:56:40,700 --> 03:56:43,900
Got to tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine.

3842
03:56:44,020 --> 03:56:46,460
I chew my nails and then I twiddle my thumbs.

3843
03:56:46,460 --> 03:56:49,540
I'm real nervous, but it sure is fun.

3844
03:56:49,660 --> 03:56:50,880
Come on baby.

3845
03:56:51,440 --> 03:56:52,500
You drive me crazy.

3846
03:56:52,720 --> 03:56:53,920
Goodness gracious.

3847
03:56:54,100 --> 03:56:55,500
Great Balls of Fire.

3848
03:57:01,380 --> 03:57:02,160
Health is art.

3849
03:57:02,260 --> 03:57:02,780
Thanks for the gift.

3850
03:57:19,280 --> 03:57:20,800
Kiss me baby.

3851
03:57:23,920 --> 03:57:25,040
Feels good.

3852
03:57:25,520 --> 03:57:26,420
Hold me baby.

3853
03:57:26,540 --> 03:57:27,640
How does this part go?

3854
03:57:27,700 --> 03:57:28,220
I can't.

3855
03:57:28,580 --> 03:57:28,960
Hold on.

3856
03:57:31,940 --> 03:57:34,600
Kiss me baby.

3857
03:57:36,340 --> 03:57:37,460
Feels good.

3858
03:57:38,240 --> 03:57:39,360
Hold me baby.

3859
03:57:41,380 --> 03:57:43,580
I want to love you like a lover should.

3860
03:57:44,280 --> 03:57:45,260
You're fine.

3861
03:57:45,720 --> 03:57:46,840
So kind.

3862
03:57:47,240 --> 03:57:50,260
Got to tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine.

3863
03:57:50,480 --> 03:57:52,780
I chew my nails and then I twiddle my thumbs.

3864
03:57:53,420 --> 03:57:55,880
I'm real nervous, but it sure is fun.

3865
03:57:56,360 --> 03:57:57,300
Come on baby.

3866
03:57:57,780 --> 03:57:58,780
You drive me crazy.

3867
03:57:58,780 --> 03:58:00,480
Goodness gracious.

3868
03:58:00,720 --> 03:58:02,040
Great Balls of Fire.

3869
03:58:10,010 --> 03:58:11,170
Goodness gracious.

3870
03:58:11,350 --> 03:58:12,710
Great Balls of Fire.

3871
03:58:13,250 --> 03:58:14,290
Is OBS better now?

3872
03:58:14,390 --> 03:58:14,630
No.

3873
03:58:23,230 --> 03:58:26,270
Wait, but your super...or your donuts are coming through.

3874
03:58:26,970 --> 03:58:27,730
Pirate, I see.

3875
03:58:27,870 --> 03:58:31,610
I'll repost or post my merch on Twitter whenever it comes out.

3876
03:58:33,350 --> 03:58:35,270
Thank you for the donation.

3877
03:58:40,870 --> 03:58:42,390
You're still young.

3878
03:58:42,550 --> 03:58:45,590
You keep calling yourself Ojiisan, but I think you're still young.

3879
03:58:46,290 --> 03:58:46,930
Don't worry.

3880
03:58:47,890 --> 03:58:49,030
I think you're okay.

3881
03:58:51,210 --> 03:58:52,610
What's another song I can sing?

3882
03:58:55,030 --> 03:58:56,390
Mint tried to leak the merch.

3883
03:59:02,910 --> 03:59:04,410
I'm Ojiisan too.

3884
03:59:04,410 --> 03:59:05,650
Me too.

3885
03:59:06,350 --> 03:59:07,730
We're all Ojiisans here.

3886
03:59:07,970 --> 03:59:08,950
Link to merch please.

3887
03:59:09,050 --> 03:59:11,010
There is no link because it's not out yet.

3888
03:59:11,070 --> 03:59:11,610
I'm sorry.

3889
03:59:12,170 --> 03:59:13,170
Japanese Goblin.

3890
03:59:13,610 --> 03:59:15,830
No, I'm a reincarnated Japanese princess.

3891
03:59:16,050 --> 03:59:18,350
Except I'm dead, so that doesn't make much sense.

3892
03:59:21,230 --> 03:59:22,750
Every time we touch.

3893
03:59:23,390 --> 03:59:26,590
Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling.

3894
03:59:27,110 --> 03:59:28,490
Oh, the MGS Con Kickstarter.

3895
03:59:29,270 --> 03:59:30,110
Yes, thank you.

3896
03:59:33,550 --> 03:59:38,790
I am a stretch goal in the MGS Con Kickstarter.

3897
03:59:39,750 --> 03:59:43,830
They're trying to have the convention next year, I believe in August.

3898
03:59:44,670 --> 03:59:50,350
And if we reach the Kickstarter goal, I will be one of the hosts for the convention.

3899
03:59:52,310 --> 03:59:55,450
Which is kind of cool, I think.

3900
03:59:57,990 --> 03:59:58,390
And...

3901
04:00:02,970 --> 04:00:03,910
Clans of Liberty.

3902
04:00:04,070 --> 04:00:04,850
No, no, no.

3903
04:00:04,930 --> 04:00:05,450
This is...

3904
04:00:07,270 --> 04:00:09,090
I actually don't know what this year is called.

3905
04:00:09,170 --> 04:00:10,390
It's based on MGS3.

3906
04:00:11,750 --> 04:00:14,710
Oh my gosh, and I'm even wearing my Metal Gear Solid Delta.

3907
04:00:16,350 --> 04:00:17,990
My loungewear right now.

3908
04:00:19,150 --> 04:00:20,930
That I got from GU.

3909
04:00:20,930 --> 04:00:24,870
But I would be alongside Vanessa Marshall.

3910
04:00:25,730 --> 04:00:28,790
And she is the voice of Olga in MGS2.

3911
04:00:29,210 --> 04:00:32,070
And also Strangelove in Peace Walker.

3912
04:00:32,750 --> 04:00:35,470
And MGSV, I suppose.

3913
04:00:37,270 --> 04:00:39,450
Con Eater, is that what it's called?

3914
04:00:39,730 --> 04:00:40,050
Yeah, yeah.

3915
04:00:46,650 --> 04:00:47,950
Strangelove, I know.

3916
04:00:49,090 --> 04:00:50,210
So crazy.

3917
04:00:51,770 --> 04:00:53,250
That little old me.

3918
04:00:56,090 --> 04:00:57,530
Little old me.

3919
04:00:58,530 --> 04:01:00,630
Did you hear about Real Eva's BA?

3920
04:01:00,750 --> 04:01:01,330
I did!

3921
04:01:02,190 --> 04:01:04,190
But it was like an open secret.

3922
04:01:04,450 --> 04:01:05,710
Everybody knew.

3923
04:01:05,970 --> 04:01:07,170
Wait, I can sing that!

3924
04:01:07,230 --> 04:01:08,430
It's a Metal Gear song.

3925
04:01:10,990 --> 04:01:14,270
Part of your world.

3926
04:01:15,530 --> 04:01:18,250
This is technically Metal Gear adjacent now.

3927
04:01:24,620 --> 04:01:25,820
If it'll play.

3928
04:01:26,100 --> 04:01:32,180
I don't know how loud it is.

3929
04:01:32,320 --> 04:01:33,260
Look at this stuff.

3930
04:01:33,900 --> 04:01:34,980
Isn't it neat?

3931
04:01:35,640 --> 04:01:38,460
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?

3932
04:01:38,940 --> 04:01:40,960
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl?

3933
04:01:41,340 --> 04:01:44,100
The girl who has everything.

3934
04:01:44,960 --> 04:01:46,740
I know it's a lot of reverb.

3935
04:01:46,840 --> 04:01:47,780
Why is it so high?

3936
04:01:49,100 --> 04:01:51,680
How many wonders can one cavern hold?

3937
04:01:52,120 --> 04:01:53,860
Looking around here you'd think.

3938
04:01:54,580 --> 04:01:54,920
Sure.

3939
04:01:55,700 --> 04:01:57,280
She's got everything.

3940
04:01:57,940 --> 04:02:01,000
I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty.

3941
04:02:02,200 --> 04:02:04,660
My OBS is frozen.

3942
04:02:04,920 --> 04:02:06,240
I can't end stream.

3943
04:02:09,020 --> 04:02:09,940
So...oh wait.

3944
04:02:10,560 --> 04:02:15,480
My OBS is frozen so I can't end stream and I do karaoke.

3945
04:02:21,300 --> 04:02:23,640
Gonna be where the people are.

3946
04:02:24,340 --> 04:02:25,460
I wanna see.

3947
04:02:25,940 --> 04:02:30,660
Wanna see them dancing, walking around on those...

3948
04:02:30,660 --> 04:02:32,060
What do you call them?

3949
04:02:33,100 --> 04:02:33,760
Feet!

3950
04:02:35,200 --> 04:02:38,080
Flipping your fins you don't get to...

3951
04:02:42,400 --> 04:02:45,260
Strolling along down a...

3952
04:02:45,260 --> 04:02:46,440
What's that word again?

3953
04:02:50,780 --> 04:02:52,540
Up where they run.

3954
04:02:56,260 --> 04:02:57,720
Ponder and dream.

3955
04:02:58,280 --> 04:03:01,440
Wish I could be part of them.

3956
04:03:03,760 --> 04:03:08,980
Or I could live out of these waters.

3957
04:03:09,780 --> 04:03:11,100
What would I pay?

3958
04:03:16,360 --> 04:03:19,300
But children, they understand.

3959
04:03:19,840 --> 04:03:22,960
That they don't reprimand their daughters.

3960
04:03:23,780 --> 04:03:26,560
Bright young women, sick of swimming.

3961
04:03:27,400 --> 04:03:29,800
Ready to stand.

3962
04:03:31,580 --> 04:03:35,820
And ready to know what the people know.

3963
04:03:36,460 --> 04:03:39,980
Ask them my questions and get some answers.

3964
04:03:40,460 --> 04:03:41,360
What's a fire?

3965
04:03:41,740 --> 04:03:42,900
And why does it...

3966
04:03:42,900 --> 04:03:43,760
What's the word?

3967
04:03:44,400 --> 04:03:44,800
Burn?

3968
04:03:46,720 --> 04:03:48,100
When's it my turn?

3969
04:03:48,840 --> 04:03:53,880
Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?

3970
04:03:58,140 --> 04:04:00,220
Out of the sea.

3971
04:04:02,040 --> 04:04:10,720
Wish I could be part of that world.

3972
04:04:18,210 --> 04:04:20,590
I'm sorry, I had a flashback I think.

3973
04:04:21,930 --> 04:04:24,250
A silly clip I saw of this song.

3974
04:04:25,890 --> 04:04:27,610
And I couldn't stop laughing about it.

3975
04:04:30,110 --> 04:04:31,250
Yeah, me too.

3976
04:04:34,450 --> 04:04:36,350
What does this have to do with Metal Gear?

3977
04:04:36,630 --> 04:04:40,950
The voice of Eva is the voice of Ariel.

3978
04:04:41,250 --> 04:04:42,110
Little Mermaid.

3979
04:04:42,970 --> 04:04:45,710
So honestly, you can make an AMV...

3980
04:04:45,710 --> 04:04:47,410
Or a VM... VMV?

3981
04:04:47,910 --> 04:04:49,070
Video music video.

3982
04:04:49,230 --> 04:04:50,570
Wait, video game...

3983
04:04:50,570 --> 04:04:51,670
VGMV.

3984
04:04:53,050 --> 04:04:54,730
Video game music video.

3985
04:04:55,410 --> 04:04:56,850
Of Eva with this song.

3986
04:04:56,850 --> 04:04:58,390
Wait, what?

3987
04:04:58,650 --> 04:04:58,970
Yeah!

3988
04:05:00,050 --> 04:05:01,990
It was revealed officially.

3989
04:05:02,810 --> 04:05:04,490
Just like this month.

3990
04:05:04,750 --> 04:05:05,530
Isn't that crazy?

3991
04:05:10,090 --> 04:05:10,890
MGSVMV.

3992
04:05:11,150 --> 04:05:15,850
It was recently revealed.

3993
04:05:15,990 --> 04:05:17,310
Eva is a Disney princess.

3994
04:05:18,230 --> 04:05:19,610
Princess and the Frog.

3995
04:05:20,130 --> 04:05:20,930
Yeah!

3996
04:05:21,710 --> 04:05:23,390
I'll sing every Disney.

3997
04:05:25,190 --> 04:05:27,410
Princess and the Frog.

3998
04:05:27,470 --> 04:05:29,810
Wait, I wrote...

3999
04:05:30,290 --> 04:05:31,450
I wrote the wrong thing.

4000
04:05:37,390 --> 04:05:40,530
And then I think I'm just gonna...

4001
04:05:41,210 --> 04:05:43,110
Force quit OBS or something.

4002
04:05:44,270 --> 04:05:48,070
This will be our outro music for today.

4003
04:05:52,270 --> 04:05:54,590
This will be our ending.

4004
04:05:54,950 --> 04:05:56,610
Princess and the Frog will be it.

4005
04:06:10,310 --> 04:06:12,970
And it's not my style.

4006
04:06:13,090 --> 04:06:13,850
Oh, that's Frogbert?

4007
04:06:21,290 --> 04:06:25,130
But I know exactly where I'm going.

4008
04:06:25,270 --> 04:06:27,830
Getting closer and closer every day.

4009
04:06:27,970 --> 04:06:30,310
And I'm almost there.

4010
04:06:31,390 --> 04:06:33,230
I'm almost there.

4011
04:06:33,910 --> 04:06:36,350
People down here think I'm crazy.

4012
04:06:37,470 --> 04:06:39,130
But I don't care.

4013
04:06:40,610 --> 04:06:42,790
Trials and tribulations.

4014
04:06:43,650 --> 04:06:45,310
I've had my share.

4015
04:06:46,350 --> 04:06:48,910
There ain't nothing gonna stop me now.

4016
04:06:48,910 --> 04:06:51,370
Because I'm almost there.

4017
04:06:51,470 --> 04:06:52,270
To Canada!

4018
04:06:54,730 --> 04:06:55,170
Woo!

4019
04:06:56,170 --> 04:06:59,390
I remember Daddy told me.

4020
04:07:00,110 --> 04:07:01,970
Fairy tales can come true.

4021
04:07:03,210 --> 04:07:05,690
You gotta make them happen.

4022
04:07:06,050 --> 04:07:08,010
It all depends on you.

4023
04:07:08,470 --> 04:07:11,790
So I work real hard each and every day.

4024
04:07:12,250 --> 04:07:14,910
And things are for sure going my way.

4025
04:07:15,910 --> 04:07:16,670
Just look.

4026
04:07:16,950 --> 04:07:18,570
Oh, I just fell over there.

4027
04:07:18,890 --> 04:07:20,370
And I messed it up.

4028
04:07:24,570 --> 04:07:26,550
I'm almost there.

4029
04:07:27,330 --> 04:07:30,010
People gonna come here from everywhere.

4030
04:07:30,370 --> 04:07:32,510
And I'm almost there.

4031
04:07:33,270 --> 04:07:35,670
I'm almost there.

4032
04:07:47,350 --> 04:07:51,350
There's been trials and tribulations.

4033
04:07:51,350 --> 04:07:54,250
You know I've had my share.

4034
04:07:54,890 --> 04:07:56,430
But I've climbed a mountain.

4035
04:07:56,610 --> 04:07:57,970
I've crossed a river.

4036
04:07:58,270 --> 04:08:00,190
And I'm almost there.

4037
04:08:01,050 --> 04:08:03,250
I'm almost there.

4038
04:08:05,830 --> 04:08:08,250
I'm almost there.

4039
04:08:11,470 --> 04:08:12,930
I can't hold it.

4040
04:08:13,230 --> 04:08:15,270
I can't hold it.

4041
04:08:19,670 --> 04:08:21,750
TASK MANAGER!

4042
04:08:23,290 --> 04:08:24,050
