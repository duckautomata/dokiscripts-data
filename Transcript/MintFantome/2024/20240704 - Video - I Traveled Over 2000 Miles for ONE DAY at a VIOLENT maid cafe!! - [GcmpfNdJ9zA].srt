00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,380
No, the title isn't clickbait.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,080
I actually went on basically a day trip from the East Coast to the West Coast just for a maid cafe.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,680
Yep.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,060
Welcome to Ton Tokoton Maid Cafe in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:22,840
It's based off of the maid cafe from the anime Akiba Maid Wars and is a collaboration between Hi-Dive, Saigames, Sentai Filmworks, and Akiba Pop-up and Live.

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:32,320
So I landed sometime around midnight the previous day and then the next day did literally nothing in my hotel room until it was time to head over to Little Tokyo.

7
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,820
I ended up being a little early to try and avoid too much traffic so it was fun to walk around and I saw that guy.

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,500
A week before the event, I was invited to join the opening day of the maid cafe and get a sneak peek of what it was going to be all about.

9
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,920
And you know, being the maid enthusiast I am, of course I had to answer the call.

10
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,820
It also feels like a rare opportunity to have these sorts of...

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,620
events pop up in the United States so I basically possessed a random person and made them go for me.

12
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,260
When it was time to go in, we were separated into tables and we had our maid greeting us the moment we walked in.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,440
Look at you, Mechi!

14
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,380
She's so cute!

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,840
My first thought going in was just how authentic it felt.

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:22,600
You know, I've been to many many many many maid cafes and several collab cafes and not even most collab cafes are as dedicated as everyone here made it to be.

17
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:30,020
So it was really fun and really set the atmosphere and you can even see how the cafe is decorated to look just like the cafe from the show.

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,920
Which, you know, could be a good thing or I mean it's kind of like... dingy.

19
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,980
But it works, right?

20
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,300
That's how it was in the show!

21
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,360
They had different menus you could choose from for your food as well as entertainment menus.

22
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,840
But uh, you know, haha, baby's first vlog and unfortunately I forgot to get footage of that today, pero...

23
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,820
But uh, it included things such as check keys, also known as Polaroid photos, performances...

24
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,340
and games with the maids.

25
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,760
They also had original merch such as pen lights, t-shirts, stickers, and more!

26
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,880
The food was pretty standard for a maid cafe, though it was a little limited, which is understandable for a pop-up.

27
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:13,860
You could choose between the porker's omurice, heart-cune chicken curry, or piglet cutlet bento, which was a tonkatsu bento.

28
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,760
No one at my table got the curry, but the omurice and bento both included a drawing, which was really cute!

29
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,800
I asked for my maid's bento.

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,920
I wanted to draw a ghost maid.

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,120
But maybe I should have asked for a pig like everyone else at the table.

32
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:29,820
Oops.

33
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,520
There were also three types of drinks.

34
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,760
The oinky doink drink, the piggy pearl iced coffee, and the oinky doink water.

35
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,740
I thought based off the name, the coffee would have some jelly in it, but it was just plain coffee.

36
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,080
And I can't have soda, but if you can, I suggest the oinky doink drink because it comes with a cute little performance from your maid.

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,000
And each drink color ends up being different, so it's really fun.

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,360
I don't know what exactly is on the dessert menu, but we were given these really awesome ranco cookies.

39
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,460
And you can see that I got ice cream all over her face.

40
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:00,920
Oops.

41
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,620
What was so fun is all the Aikome!

42
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,520
It's also themed for the cafe.

43
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,440
Instead of your normal moi moi kyun, you're squealing like a pig saying buhi!

44
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,240
It's all really really sweet.

45
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,780
The best part by far was the performance though.

46
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,740
If you haven't watched the anime, be careful of spoilers.

47
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,560
But they basically did a quick rendition of the whole show for us, which is really really awesome.

48
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,960
It was so fun watching the maids go from violet gangsters to cutesy dancing idols.

49
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:38,240
And it was all songs from the anime, so it was really fun recognizing the opening song and the insert songs.

50
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,200
Everyone was so invested in their part and making it as authentic as possible.

51
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,340
I felt it was really worth it for the experience, and if you're in the LA area while it's still running, definitely check it out!

52
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:57,320
The cafe runs from June 28th to July 28th, and tickets are online only and reservation, so get your ticket before they sell out!

53
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,040
You can even see the cameraman from the cafe is dressed as the debt collector from the show.

54
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,620
Like come on, the level of effort was definitely there.

55
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,060
I also want to say, even though I was invited to go, I wasn't sponsored at all for this trip.

56
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,320
Everything was out of my pocket, so these are all my real feelings about it.

57
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,520
Overall, it was such a unique experience.

58
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,320
And if you've never been to Japan, or been to a major city, you should definitely check it out.

59
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:26,160
Or if you've been to a maid cafe and kind of want to compare your experiences between the two, definitely check it out.

60
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,600
Boo-hee!

61
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,060
Come on!

62
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,000
Come on!
