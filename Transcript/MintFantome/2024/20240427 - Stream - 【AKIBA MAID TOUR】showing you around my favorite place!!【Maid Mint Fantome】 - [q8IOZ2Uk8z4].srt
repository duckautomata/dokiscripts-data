00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,280
Welcome to Akihabara.

2
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,160
Say the line, boss.

3
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,380
Oh, come on.

4
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,840
I was just a few minutes late.

5
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,100
I was just a little bit late.

6
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,340
Keep joining, huh?

7
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,340
Let's hop right in right.

8
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,100
Oh, I thought they used to do that thing where they'd like
make you go.

9
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,280
I thought they did the glasses.

10
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:35,660
Yoko?

11
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,440

13
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,940
Hi.

14
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,500
Hi Mervi.

15
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,940
Why is this so suspicious?

16
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,260
Tadaiima!

17
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,400

18
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,580
Oh, that's Google Earth.

00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,460
Oh, we're in Google Maps.

20
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,460
Oh, Taco Glass is where?

21
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,460
Okay, hold on.

00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,400

24
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,100
Is that better?

25
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,420
They're not otaku glasses though.

26
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,340
They're just regular glasses.

27
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,420
Missing the halo.

28
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,660

I don't want to talk about it because I couldn't even get
it.

53
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:17,150
Okay?

54
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,150

So can we move on?

Don't, isn't it?

58
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,160
It's so rude to ask a lady her size.

59
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,280
Please.

60
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,860
You're going to be...

61
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,000
Not VTuber Academy.

62
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,120
To the Love Live Academy too!

63
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,240
Oh my god.

64
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,600
It's insane.

65
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,620
My bread has more physics than I do.

66
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,080
Oh my god, it's the most jiggly bread in the world.

67
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,500
Oh!

68
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,240
Why is it so jiggly?

69
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,540
Okay, I don't know if I can share it.

70
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,100
Okay.

71
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,460
Let's get going!

72
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,440
We're gonna be late for class!

73
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,420
Do you know where?

74
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,600
They went to...

75
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:20,840
Oh wait.

76
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,320
When they went to school in Love Live, it was...

77
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,100
Oh, wait.

78
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,980
It was the rival school.

79
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,620
Oh, shoot.

80
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,520
Um...

81
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,000
It wasn't the Love Live girls.

82
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,980
Uh-oh, I got it wrong.

83
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,280
Uh-oh.

84
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,340
Um...

85
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,520
Yeah, A-Rise went here.

86
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,190
Just...

87
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,990
Oh wait, no, no, turn around, turn around.

88
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:58,390
Google!

89
00:09:59,390 --> 00:09:59,810
This way!

90
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,230
Oh, oh my gosh.

91
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,630
They're just like me!

92
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,250
There's ghost people.

93
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,270
Great bit, thanks, Mint.

94
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,650
A real knee slapper.

95
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,030
I knew you would like it.

96
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,810
Goch, goch, goch!

97
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,670
Chah, chah, chah, chah, chah, chah, chah, chah, chah.

98
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,290
Run, run, wait.

99
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,450
I'm trapped inside the...

100
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,810
I'm trapped inside the station!

101
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:29,970
This...

102
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,740
How do I get out of the station?

103
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,920
It's already night time even.

104
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,420
Who puts salt around the exit?

105
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,280
I wonder what time they took this at.

106
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:51,680
Oh.

107
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,260
They all think I'm really suspicious, guys.

108
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,220
Oh, no.

109
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,060
They're like, Hey, what's this ghost doing over here?

110
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:11,560
Why are we in Japan, but we got a Brooklyn accident?

111
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,040
Hey, what's that ghost doing over there with that bread of
ours, that jiggly bread?

112
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,580
Oh, don't mind me, officer.

113
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,500
Don't mind me.

114
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,100
Let's just turn around for them.

115
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,140
Okay, let's go back in.

116
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,620
Oh, no, we can't go back.

117
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,800
Remilia.

118
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,740
Wait a second.

119
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,500
What is going on?

120
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,540
What is going on here?

121
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,240
Um.

122
00:11:51,640 --> 00:12:02,400

almost positive i was here because i got i have goods from

00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:25,090

125
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,470
Oh, it's dates.

126
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,790
Oh, Flan!

127
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,590
Collaboration event.

128
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,010
Let's just start from here.

129
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,430
Welcome to Akihabara!

130
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,090
Welcome, welcome.

131
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:51,110
Oh my gosh, thank you for the birthday gift and kiss
cubbies.

132
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,490
Thank you!

133
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,180
Yippee!

134
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,500
So Akiba actually, Akiba Station at least, has two exits.

135
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,580
This is the electric town gate, as it says here.

136
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,400
And over there, there's another one all the way down that
end.

137
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,660
If we want to get to like Yodobashi more easily.

138
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,600
So Toho Stream when?

139
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,260
Mmm, mmm, when I wonder.

140
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,720
It's a good idea.

141
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:37,700
Oh no.

142
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,800
I tried turning off, sorry, wait.

143
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,060
Let me see if I can fix something real quick.

144
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,880
So sorry guys.

145
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,120
I tried turning off the notifs for like the members when
they become members through gifted.

146
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,680
Since it kind of clogs up the notifications a little bit.

147
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,340
But I don't, maybe it didn't work.

148
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,580
Yeah, I turned it off, but it didn't work.

149
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,360
I'll try it later.

150
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:05,880
Again.

151
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,720
That is basically Danmaku and you're pretty good at handling
that.

152
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,080
So, where's the chubby girl's maid cafe I?

153
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,800
Maximum.

154
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,660
I'll get there.

155
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,280
I'll get there.

156
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,300
I'll get there.

157
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,320
Holy crap, ghosts.

158
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,100
Yeah, these are the ghosts of Akiba Station.

159
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,440
These are the ghosts of Akihabara Station.

160
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:28,780
Cool.

161
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,260
Whoa!

162
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,160

163
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:43,020
And that, that's, um, that's the, that's, he's, see the
ghost.

164
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,820
This is where you pay respect.

165
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:59,580
So yeah, once you leave Electric Town Gate, um, here's where
you can buy your tickets or charge your suika or pasimo.

166
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,420
You come here.

167
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:06,900
Scary!

168
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,740
This is Atre right here.

169
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,400
Look, they're all worshiping Remilia.

170
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,300
Oh, Remilia Sama, kawaii!

171
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,160
Remilia Sama, kawaii!

172
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:40,820

176
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,500
Remilia Sama is justice!

177
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,590
It was Bochi the Rock when I was there last.

178
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,530
Oh, I was there for Bochi too.

179
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,210
So this is obviously Halloween time because yeah.

00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,290
Can I get out of here?

181
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:18,970
Can I escape?

182
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:29,630
So, if you go out, if you're facing the gates, and you go
this way, out the left side, Can I change it so it's not

183
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,190
nighttime?

184
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,090
Oh my gosh!

185
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,090
Wait, this is so old!

186
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,630
They haven't even finished the hotel here yet.

187
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,170
That's crazy.

188
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,550
That's so crazy.

189
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,010
Wait, can I change the year?

190
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,150
How can I change the year?

191
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,250
Um...

192
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,010
Emilia, Samma, charisma is amazing.

193
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,310
Yes!

194
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:51,450
Yes!

195
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,750
Yeah, and it still says Sega.

196
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,090
Eh.

197
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,170
How do I change the date?

198
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,460
Hold on.

199
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:22,240
Let me maybe try going back to the map.

200
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,440
And then we're going to zoom in here.

201
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,380
Maybe it'll give us a different date if I come in.

202
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,580
Like right here.

203
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,220
Ta-da!

204
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,520
Aha!

205
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,960
July 2022!

206
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:35,880
2022.

207
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,000
Welcome to Akihabara Station.

208
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,560
There we go, there we go, there we go.

209
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:48,620
If you ever see these people, they often do blood drives in
Akihabara.

210
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,520
I've never done it before because I'm terrified of needles.

211
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,000
But if you can donate the blood, I recommend.

212
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,280
And now the hotel that I talked about is completed.

213
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,960
There's a new days, Konbini right here.

214
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:15,540
I've actually I've never stayed at this hotel before either
but um yeah you got the gigo here which is your um which is

215
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,580
your arcade used to be Sega as you saw

216
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:30,200
um yeah I don't know how much to say about that it's kind of
sad let's see if we go down here in here you have a made

217
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:37,300
dreaming um this is the heaven's gate location which if
you're going to I recommend this one the most because it's

218
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:47,580
the biggest and I think they have the best live stage and
stuff like that So love live love live Collaboration cafe

219
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,500

one two three four five six seven eight nine two ten Shit
Bro thinks she goes here.

221
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,960
But I thought there were only nine girls.

222
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,360
Huh?

223
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,400
Miku is...

224
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:21,640
What?

225
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,500
I never knew that they had a collab like that.

226
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,540
That's so awesome.

227
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,820
Miku jump scare.

228
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,260
Yeah, right?

229
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:31,760
Oh.

230
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,400
There's some tourist, like, t-shirt places here.

231
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,720
This is M's.

232
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:55,260
is just a giant sexy store you know what I mean it's just a
giant everything is sexy in here it's a sexy sexy store I

234
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,180

235
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,040
Let's go in?

236
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,060
Can we?

237
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:16,840
No.

238
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,160
What's this, though?

239
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,720
I don't know what that is.

240
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,880
I don't know what that's advertising.

241
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,500
Dangerous building.

242
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,680
Y'all bad, isn't it?

243
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:34,740
Yeah.

244
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,920
It's a bit of...

245
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,260
Yeah.

246
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,220
Let's see.

247
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:38,940
There's a...

248
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:45,760
If you're wanting a hotel that is, um, sorry, my, I feel
like my tour is going to be all over the place.

249
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,820
If you guys have any specific questions, let me know.

250
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,180
But, uh, if you're looking for a hotel, a good hotel in the
Akiba area, there's this Washington hotel.

251
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,680
I've stayed here before.

252
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,560
I recommend it.

253
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,080
It's very close, of course, to the station and obviously to
everything as well.

254
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,260
Um, so if you need a good hotel, I recommend.

255
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,740
What's a good hotel?

256
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,040
I'm glad you asked.

257
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,440
If you're looking for a good hotel, I recommend...

258
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,260
Oh god, we have to get past...

259
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,980
We can't go past the patchy slot...

260
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,880
The pachinko machine.

261
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,960
Pachinko parlor.

262
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,300
Wait, we're stuck!

263
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,780
Oh, here we go.

264
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,220
We're stuck.

265
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,720
We can't go past the pachinko.

266
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,980
Our body is getting sucked into the pachinko.

267
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:30,780
Whoa!

268
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,180
Where's the McDonald's?

269
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,520
I can show you!

270
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,820
Wait, how do I get back?

271
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,940
Oh my gosh.

272
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,040
What is wrong with Google Maps anymore?

273
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,840
Why am I stuck in certain places?

274
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,740
Did he lose the footage?

275
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,800
What happened?

276
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,480
What happened?

277
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,880
Well, I was gonna show you over there, but I guess we can't.

278
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,000
Uh-oh, I'm stuck again.

279
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,280
Oh!

280
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,360
Maybe let me try with my mouse instead.

281
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,480
Ah!

282
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,280
I mean, not my mouse, I meant my keyboard.

283
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,490
There it is.

284
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,070
And there's also a Denny's right here.

285
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:25,890
So it's kind of convenient to, like, have the hotel and then
the Denny's.

286
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,250
Mr. Donut Doko?

287
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,530
I'm getting there.

288
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,430
I'm getting there.

289
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,590
I'm getting there.

290
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,810
You guys are so impatient.

291
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:34,510
Oh, my gosh.

292
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,550
But you guys are just excited.

293
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,010
I get it.

294
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:36,390
Me too.

295
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,750
This part of the Akiba station, there's, like, a Starbucks.

296
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,550
And there's a Mujie.

297
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,790
and there's a GU.

298
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,070
So if you want some more normy kind of stuff, it's over
here.

299
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,970
But down this way...

300
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:52,210
Meow.

301
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:52,930
Meow.

302
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,130
Meow.

303
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,710
Wow.

304
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,370
The container is still here.

305
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,710
But it's not anymore, unfortunately.

306
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:10,210
This used to be a store where they would have collab stuff
with different games and anime and stuff like that.

307
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,330
But unfortunately, it's not anymore.

308
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,250
We'll also go down here.

309
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,490
This will... I'll lead you out back home.

310
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:19,490
Don't worry.

311
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:20,830
Meow.

312
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,090
Whoa.

313
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,070
So here's Yodobashi.

314
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:31,550
Which is like your big Yodobashi camera is your big
electronic store.

315
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,070
There's so many floors.

316
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,510
And then up top there's also like lots of restaurants.

317
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:37,770
There's Tower Records.

318
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,610
There's a Daiso in there.

319
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,410
If you're looking for like...

320
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:42,910
What's it called?

321
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,390
Um, Yotobashi is huge.

322
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,530
Yeah, it's so, so big.

323
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,970
This was what Akihabara was originally known for before
anime.

324
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,010
Yeah, exactly.

325
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,650
Known for their electronics stuff.

326
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:03,350
Well, yes, but more so like the smaller electronic stores,
right?

327
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,770
But also in here are a lot of great, um, can we go in there?

328
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,210
No.

329
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,670
Um, in here there's a lot of good little stores.

330
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:24,430
store there's jack and the donuts which i suggest you don't
but um there's takoyaki there's uh um there's several places

331
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:36,610
um and then right here's a cat cafe which i've never been to
before though so um yeah um now if we turn around this is

332
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:45,550
the other side this is that other exit i talked about
earlier so what in the donuts I think you heard me.

333
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:48,740
What if Akiba had...

334
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,890
Oh, sorry, I was reading the wrong one.

335
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,750
I was wondering, last time you went, do you still hear the
May Dreaming song play basically everywhere?

336
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,630
Only in one place do I hear the May Dreaming song play.

337
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,570
Only in one place, and I can show you where they still play
it.

338
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:08,230
Top left corner, see there's a more dates button to switch
quickly.

339
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,570
Oh, it wasn't there before though.

340
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,550
Oh, did I miss it just before?

341
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,310
Also, I can't believe I'm backseeing in Google Maps.

342
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,090
Let's go.

343
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,190
What if Akiba had a waffle house?

344
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,330
That would make it perfect, to be honest.

345
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,110
If you were asking about the McDonald's, here's one of them.

346
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:34,530
Here's one McDonald's that Akiba has to offer you, but
there's actually another one.

347
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,130
What if Akiba got a Wendy's?

348
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,290
Okay, that I would be very excited about.

349
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,690
I actually like first kitchen very much

350
00:25:53,690 --> 00:26:03,410
but yeah you can go in here and get some snacks there's also
um if you need to take the hibia line um so this is the JR

351
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:16,370
so you're gonna have like the Yamanote line and um Chioda
line and um all those what's what's the yellow one oh my god

352
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,630
I can't remember the names anymore.

353
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,650
I like Jack in the Donut.

354
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:21,750
Oh,

355
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,150
yes, you know.

356
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,470
Chuo, thank you.

357
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,530
The Chuo, so blind.

358
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:30,750
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

359
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:31,130
So yeah.

360
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:38,870
If you come to Akiba and you are taking the Hibiya line, you
will come out over here, actually.

361
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:45,290
So if you're just like, wait, this doesn't look like the
Akihabara I saw in Mint stream.

362
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,610
Actually, I want I wonder if we can get over there.

363
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:54,730
I wonder if we can, if we can zoom.

364
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:59,690
Sorry if the zoom is a little, I'm trying not to go too fast
to give you, give you a whiplash, you know?

365
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,530
Here.

366
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,630
This is where you'll come out the Metro.

367
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:13,990
So, if you just go through this little way, and then, walk,
walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, you'll reach

368
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,990
Akiba over here.

369
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,370
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

370
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,910
You're running over, everyone.

371
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,590
I know.

372
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:29,130
But yeah, we're just gonna focus on, like, the main, maybe,
like, well, not entirely Chuo-Dori.

373
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,350
We'll go to a different, a couple other places, too.

374
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,490
So, you walk, walk, walk.

375
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,810
What if you come down this way?

376
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,330
I wonder, can we go in here?

377
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,750
Can we go in here?

378
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,440
Um, I don't think we can.

379
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:54,880
can so if you accidentally don't go out the electric exit
gate payment I know you're probably not gonna see this but

380
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:09,420
I'm such a big fan oh my gosh thank you thank you yes
sometimes you can choose from the main map let's see if

381
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:22,040
it'll let me it's like this tiny no it doesn't look like
they filmed in there that's okay though that's okay i'm

382
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:29,020
blocking it but um this so if you don't go through the
electric town exit and you come out the other side what if

383
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:37,120
you're like oh gosh i got lost and then welcome back mint
what is post pandemic akiba like chuo dori has looked like a

384
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:44,080
ghost town lol on street view recently and 99 of dojin
stores closed what in tarnation is going on there now akiba

385
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:53,340
is crowded as heck maybe maybe in street view it's very not
crowded but oh my gosh it is extremely crowded all the time

386
00:28:53,340 --> 00:29:02,540
very very often so it's definitely not dying which is great
you're definitely not going to see this but I'm a very small

387
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:14,240
fan teeny tiny yeah unfortunately we Torano did Torano Anna
did close which is so sad but yeah anyway you guys let me

388
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:23,140
explain if you go through here you'll get back to where
where we saw that mage can made dream in but also in here is

389
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:32,820
the square enix cafe which they also do like monthly collab
stuff last time i was there they were doing the final

390
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:40,340
fantasy 7 one but it was busy every single day but certain
so you like needed a reservation but there's also a takeout

391
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:48,440
menu um which so you can get takeout stuff and also there's
a store which you can just kind of walk into you don't have

392
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,380
to have a reservation at the cafe.

393
00:29:52,460 --> 00:30:01,260
And, but if it's also like a not as popular game that
they're doing or popular property, because sometimes they've

394
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,080
done like Full Metal Alchemist too.

395
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,300
Like a permanent Square Enix Cafe, not a pop-up.

396
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,220
Yeah, it's permanent.

397
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,800
It's permanent.

398
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,780
There's also like some crane games in here.

399
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,380
There's a few restaurants in here as well.

400
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,900
There's a drugstore in here.

401
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:24,060
It's actually, there's actually quite a lot going on in this
little small space so uh check check it out even though it's

402
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:36,320
just a tiny tunnel i'm a ceiling fan whoa whoa that's my
sound of a ceiling whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

thank you for being thank you for sharing your averageness

405
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:09,640
oh I don't usually recommend going to like book offs and
stuff in super crowded places like Akiba but if you're

406
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:18,620
looking for a book off it's over here by Danka so I don't
know but I've gone in here before I've gotten a couple

407
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:26,760
things i've been able to find some things that are pretty
cool so thank you you're welcome

408
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:40,840
um and there's also like some other like uh tourist shops
but not so many over here it's the big this is like this i

409
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:49,340
always or not always but um sometimes if i'd come to akiba
in the in the mornings that I see a line of people waiting

410
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:59,280
for the patchy pachinko like lined up right here in the
mornings it's pretty it's pretty like wow they're ready

411
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:08,080
they're ready to pachinko you'll definitely see this but I'm
like one of those fancy modern high-tech bladeless fans like

412
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:16,160
a Dyson fan Wow from here you can see pasera We're gonna go
down that way now.

413
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:26,140
So yeah, this is the tunnel that we would have gone through
if they would have led us.

414
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,680
There's the hotel here.

415
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:38,440
There's a little, it says ice cream, but it's like, they
have, in the fall and stuff they have like a yaki emo and

416
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,180
stuff like that.

417
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,580
So yummy!

418
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,220
Can I, if I move over just a tiny bit.

419
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,420
A little, just a scooch.

420
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,820
Oh, I went the wrong way.

421
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:51,480
Wait.

422
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,560
I was just going to see if I could zoom in and see the
square.

423
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,220
It's like blocked by the pole, though.

424
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,280
But it's on this side.

425
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,160
It's right over there.

426
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,080
Mr. Duna Doko.

427
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,900
Hold on.

428
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,280
Hold on.

429
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,840
They opened Yostar Shop right in front of the station.

430
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,400
Really?

431
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,860
Wait, when?

432
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,140
Because I know there was a Yostar Shop at...

433
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,620
in the anime Minecraft

434
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:32,080

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:47,940

atore is yuru yuri

438
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:16,400
um if you go in on the second floor on the second floor is
where you can find whatever pop-up shop is going on.

439
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,480
Last year, my cousin was at Akiba and I asked him to get a
few Konami Famicom games at Super Potato, but they were a

440
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,180
bit expensive.

441
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,800
Do you know a place that sells retro games for cheaper?

442
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,960
I know another place.

443
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,520
I can't say it's that much cheaper, though.

444
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:47,840
And Akiba, because it's kind of really picked over, things
are going to be kind of why is one of the windows empty it's

445
00:34:47,840 --> 00:35:00,060
actually so sad that Akarine is getting blocked by the momoi
doke so this clock is called the momoi doke the momoi clock

446
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:12,600
momoi clock and it's it's kind of like you know it's been
here for year like decades it's it's always just been like

447
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:22,060
this symbol of Akiba and it's block block no

448
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:38,460
yeah the momoi clock so um yeah because uh momoi Haruko um
she kind of like she she would like have she would have

449
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:47,360
meetings here and um she even has a song about this clock
like Like, it's just, it got moved before.

450
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,620
It was in a different spot.

451
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,120
I don't remember where.

452
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,900
It got moved a little after they did some construction on
the station.

453
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,240
But, yeah.

454
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,620
But also, as you can see, up here, they have, like, a
Uniqlo.

455
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,060
The Idol Master shop is up here, too.

456
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,660
The Idol Master official shop.

457
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,800
Cospa, which, if you don't know, there's several Cospas in
Akiba.

458
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,480
But they also have, like, oh, yeah, three quarters.

459
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:20,120
If you want a good, like, it's not a, it's not a 100 yen
store, but it's like three coins.

460
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:20,980
It's like 300 yen.

461
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,200
Everything is really high quality and nice.

462
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,320
Even though most of it's 300 yen.

463
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,740
Momoi Haruko, Queen of Akiba.

464
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,340
Yeah.

465
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:39,080
But yeah, there's also a bookstore up here too.

466
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,480
And the Kaspa is selling, like, recently.

467
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:51,060

00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,760
Pachinko, Pachinko.

511
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,520
Oh my god.

512
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,620
This is so funny.

513
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,440
Do you want...

514
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,040
Do you know...

515
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,480
For people, don't say if you know what this is.

516
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:20,480
stores but do you want to guess what this what this line is
for oh my gosh this is so funny because it even looks kind

517
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:27,740
of early in the in the day because there's not so many
people so there's already people lining up for this crepes

518
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:32,140
okay good figures mm-hmm ramen mm-hmm

519
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,040
cards mm-hmm yeah like some of even some of the start stores
aren't even open like here's another

520
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:57,720
pancakes oh good guess good guess this is for ensemble stars
as you can see this is the ensemble star store and so um in

521
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:04,680
the past you used to have a you used to need a reservation
to get in but i think nowadays you can just kind of go but

522
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:14,800
this screen right here is always playing ensemble stars so
these people are up early in the morning For On Stars.

523
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,440
But it's right here.

524
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,260
I think it's this one.

525
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,620
But it's right in the same building as Gamers.

526
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,820
Which is, of course, an iconic store in Akihabara.

527
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:35,660
This is, you know, Digico from DigiCara and everything.

528
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,880
So the line is for pretty boys.

529
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:40,500
Yeah.

530
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,140
Look at them.

531
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:43,480
Look at them.

532
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,360
They're so excited to get their merch.

533
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:57,170
Um, and what is this?

534
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,350
What is this?

535
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,890
What is this?

536
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,150
I actually don't know.

537
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,270
Sorry, I'm a fake fan.

538
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,470
Kunoichi, Tzubaki.

539
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,220
Mm, forehead anime.

540
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,640
I can tell.

541
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,940
Why does it look like Takagi-san?

542
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,980
Is it the same artist?

543
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,160
She looks like Takagi-san.

544
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,940
And forehead.

545
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,940
Oh, it is the same artist.

546
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,460
I've never seen it, though.

547
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:41,520
But sometimes they do, like, say there's a new single coming
out for an anime.

548
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:50,760
They will, typically, the singer will have, like, an an
event at gamers on the top floor and they do other like

549
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:57,700
collaboration stuff too sometimes if like a concert was
released if you go um and like go shopping you can see like

550
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:07,680
the say the costume that the idol wore or the say you wore
at the at the concert so it's still fun to stop by and i

551
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:14,060
like to go in there and check out what's kind of new
sometimes so earlier someone asked where Can you still hear

552
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,240
the Made Dreamin theme song played in Akiba?

553
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,140
And it's this one.

554
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,720
This one is always playing the Made Dreaming theme song.

555
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,820
So if you walk by here, you'll definitely hear it.

556
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:33,500
My long last Oshi used to do regular shows up there.

557
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,960
Wait, who was it?

558
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,500
Who was it?

559
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,400
24-hour soba, huh?

560
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,080
Yes, this is Fuji soba.

561
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:52,020
which is a chain actually but they are 24 hours so if you're
in akiba maybe you are like staying here um in a hotel or

562
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:59,160
something and you're like oh my gosh i'm so hungry but i
don't want combini food there is a fuji soba here that is 24

563
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:07,300
hours so um and it's a chain so if you're somewhere else and
you're like oh fuji soba someone from sound or an ah don't

564
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,520
want to go into understandable

565
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,940
Yeah, but they don't just have soba.

566
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,660
They think they have like other stuff too, curry, things
like that.

567
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,460
And they do take out.

568
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,360
This place right here used to be the Volks building.

569
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,780
Used to be just a bunch of...

570
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,980
This one's really depressing to explain.

571
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,760
It used to be the Volks building.

572
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:43,140
And it used to have like a bunch of, you know, just anime
figure shops and collabs.

573
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:51,640
stores and things like that unfortunately that's not the
case anymore but and it was empty for years it was empty for

574
00:44:51,640 --> 00:45:07,540
a very long time until recently until very recently where um
where um it is now a drugstore so it's not empty anymore at

575
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:15,920
least because it was really depressing walking by it and it
just being all boarded up and nothing going on but it's now

576
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:28,460
it's now a drugstore so it's a little depressing um but yeah
and by drugstore i mean like you know you can get medicine

577
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:37,460
and things i love drugs legal or illegal but i mean yeah

578
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,220
There's one right over here, there's a Matsukio!

579
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:46,640
Right there!

580
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,980
You don't need another drugstore right across the street.

581
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,000
Ah, zanen.

582
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,480
Over here.

583
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:55,740
Oh, maybe.

584
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,080
Uh, hold on, maybe if I go out a little bit more.

585
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,180
We transported back to 2013!

586
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,360
Oh my gosh.

587
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,720
Oh, you can see it.

588
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,620
It was so...

589
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:08,900
Wait.

590
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:14,940
Yes.

591
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,500
Wait.

592
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:16,160
Yes.

593
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,940
I was like, wait, where am I right now?

594
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,500
We transported.

595
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,020
Wait, see more dates.

00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,360

597
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:29,060
There we go.

598
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:33,260
Sorry, I'm trying to keep this as updated as possible for
now so that we...

599
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,980
I can give a more authentic toll, a more accurate toll,
right?

600
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,620
time travel.

601
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,060
Can you see the Sega building from here?

602
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,140
You mean the Giggle?

603
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,180
Yes.

604
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,480
Yeah, the Giggles right there.

605
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:54,900
Down here.

606
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,600
Now we're in 2017.

607
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,020
Now we're in 2015.

608
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,560
We're back in 2015.

609
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,540
Can I change the date again?

610
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,600
Oh, wait, we have September 2nd.

611
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:23,360

variety of stuff but it's a little little yabai at the lamb

613
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,280

614
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,640
Yea, it's a little...

615
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,920
All stories yabai.

616
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,360
Part yabai.

617
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,080
Maybe mostly yabai.

618
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,560
Maybe mostly yabai.

619
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:57,860
But what I wanted to point out here was the Pepper Ranch
because I really like Pepper Lounge.

620
00:47:59,060 --> 00:47:59,940
Pepper Lounge.

621
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:00,780
Doko desuka.

622
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,380
Right here.

623
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,460
Mother Evers.

624
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:04,940
Pepper Lounge.

625
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,100
Pepper Lounge.

626
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:16,360
This used to be the only Pepper lunch in akiba but they
recently also opened another one all the way down there but

627
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:27,020
it's much bigger this one is really small so if you're
craving pepper lunch pepper ranch pepper ranch what does

629
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:45,480
akiba Oh, it's Bo- Oh, I was like, Oh, it's Bochi the Rock!

630
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,500
I obviously know Bochi's- Wait, you were being serious.

631
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,800
I thought you were kidding and being like, Oh, Bo- What are
you talking about?

632
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,240
That's Bochi the Rock, obviously.

633
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,380
Actually, this is your lie in April.

634
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,440
There's actual Bochi.

635
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,180
The gamer's OnStar.

636
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,280
I like this place, Oh, well, oh, it turned into a- That's
right.

637
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:15,660
I forgot it turned into a trading card, but it used to be
kind of like a pop-up store and sometimes they would be like

638
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:23,740
there's another one there's another place that does this in
Akiba but it used to be like a one time it was a pop-up

639
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:32,920
store for like say you branded headphones so like if you're
just like oh I want O'Gurayui to speak in my ear yukana you

640
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:44,860
could get that but there's another place like that last time
I when they were selling eye cuts headphones.

641
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,400
But now it's trading card.

642
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:55,820
Okay.

643
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:04,990
I don't even think I'm ready to talk about it.

644
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:05,830
Over here.

645
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:07,910
Hey, get out of my way.

646
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:09,210
Get out of my way.

647
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:10,750
Thank you.

648
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:16,090
Imagine an anime about someone trapped in Akiba who keeps
getting transported to different ears as they walk around.

649
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,830
That would be actually so awesome.

650
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,390
Right here is Manse Bashi.

651
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:22,870
Manse Bashi Bridge.

652
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:26,030
Which is just iconic bridge in Akiba.

653
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,290
You have the train that runs here.

654
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:32,510
You have some restaurants here.

655
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:36,450
You just have a really beautiful view of Akiba here.

656
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:44,990
This used to be a famous famous Katsu place, but it's now...

657
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,750
Not just Katsu, like a famous...

658
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,510
It's just like a famous...

659
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:52,690
How do I say?

660
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:53,090
Meat?

661
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:57,390
I'm so depressed about it.

662
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:03,450
But...

663
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:05,530
I believe they opened like a...

664
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:12,710
Not... I mean, obviously this doesn't exist anymore, but
they opened a smaller scale store with sandwiches.

665
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:18,570
from what I understand so

666
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:24,770
yeah had the meats

667
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:35,280
they did have katsusando though they did have like some they
had like a store down here where you could get some stuff

668
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,560
and then the restaurant obviously

669
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:51,820
akiba is changing but also so much of akiba is still the
same so it's not so bad it's bad but not so bad which way

00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:26,800
The Pasella...

677
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,760
The Pasella Resorts?

678
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,840
This is also...

679
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,540
Not just a pop-up.

680
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:43,080
But I believe they also do other cafe pop-ups as well.

681
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,660
Like one time they had...

682
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,740
Oh, here you can see.

683
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,300
What is that?

684
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:46,920
What is that?

685
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,660
Is that Kochi Usa?

686
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,900
Am I dumb?

687
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,380
It is Kochi Usa?

688
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,040
Okay, okay.

689
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:07,860
I was like, wait.

690
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:08,820
I don't want to be...

691
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,100
I don't want to say I'm being wrong.

692
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,840
But yeah, they do other pop-ups in here.

693
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,440
It's definitely worth checking out what they're doing.

694
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:19,060
Because I believe also this is the Monster Hunter place,
too.

695
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:27,080
so there's like there's a lot going on here all the time um
so it's the monster hunter cafe the grand blue cafe and then

696
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:38,020
what other other pop-up cafes as well oh see oh yeah yeah
yeah manhan on the third floor um so yes um there's also uh

697
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:45,660
pasela is a karaoke place it's like a chain a chain karaoke
one and it's not this isn't even the only one in akiba but

698
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:50,220
um they are known for their Toast boxes.

699
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:50,860
These.

700
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,360
They're so yummy.

701
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:54,280
They're so yummy.

702
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:54,940
So, so good.

703
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,260
The toast cafe.

704
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:56,900
Yeah, yeah.

705
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,280
You can get them.

706
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,040
You can order them while you're like.

707
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,580
While you're singing.

708
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,080
But this is not just.

709
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,960
It says like famous dessert in Akiba.

710
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:07,980
That's a lie.

711
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,680
You can get the honey toast.

712
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:10,980
At any Pase.

713
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,200
Maybe they do specialized ones here.

714
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,620
But like you can get the honey toast anywhere.

715
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:28,740
and what it is is it's like it's it's it's like four pieces
of toast that make a box and then they put like ice cream

716
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:40,140
and fruit and stuff inside the box inside the inside the
toast so it's really yummy and um um also here is a theater

717
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:49,940
called parms which is a event It's basically just a live,
it's like a theater, not a live house.

718
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:56,460
It's a theater, which this group called Kamen Joshi, they
play there every day.

719
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,560
So if you want to go see some idols and you're just like,
well, I don't know where to go.

720
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,200
You can always come here and they will be doing a live show.

721
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,120
So it's pretty fun.

722
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:10,340
Every day.

723
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,000
This is some collab cafe.

724
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,340
But I can't read it.

725
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:30,680
I have no idea what a or orsia a orsia I can't read it I saw
it down here too all I can see is cafe

727
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:54,720
her why is she even giving us the tour right now she doesn't
even know she doesn't even go here if you come down this way

728
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,460
a little bit too

729
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:11,420
if you are a fan whoa if you're a fan of love live which
maybe these guys are too this is actually one of the parks

730
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:17,900
that they visit in love live why are there why are there Why
is there such a big group of...

731
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,100
I say park, but there's like just a couple benches in here.

732
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,100
Why is there...

733
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,000
Why is there such a big group of people?

734
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,440
What's going on?

735
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,680
Those are definitely love libraries.

736
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:38,920
It almost looks like this guy has like some anime, like
something on...

737
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,560
Some, some like...

738
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,100
Maybe it's Oshi.

739
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:46,340
But yeah.

740
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,040
When was this taken?

741
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:49,980
September 2023?

742
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,880
If you were there, September 2023, I'm so...

743
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,740
Is that you?

744
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,580
I'm just so...

745
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:03,860
What is going on?

746
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:04,640
I'm so curious.

747
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,160
But yeah.

748
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,420
In store, meow.

749
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,420
Let's see.

750
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,360
I'm trying to decide how I want to go about this.

751
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,380
There's some other stuff back there.

752
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,580
I know that's like the most vague phrasing ever.

753
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,460
We won't go down the street yet.

754
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,880
Let's go back to Chuo Dori.

755
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,660
Wasn't one where Nico's apartment got torn down and made
into a park?

756
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:44,380
No.

757
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:46,600
This park was already there.

758
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:58,700
they are they sit in it in love life in that park like in
the um in the original love life so but i don't i don't

759
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:02,960
actually know where nico's apartment was i'll be honest i
actually don't know

760
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:19,480
so yay this this main street here like this this street that
goes down is called it's like Chuo Dori it's like like I

761
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:29,600
said the main street so if we go down a little here this is
where we started hold on I'm just gonna go down a little bit

762
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:36,600
this is this is Akiba station down here just to get you a
little bit oriented there's that hotel there's Radio Kaikan

763
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:51,160
there's gamers there's the main dream in so this is all that
if you turn around here you have oh you have let me move

764
00:58:51,160 --> 00:59:01,040
that a little bit you have ono den which is like a famous
this ono den has been here for ever as well in akihabara

765
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:12,820
it's one of those like staple um electronic stores that has
been here forever and um but in in the ono den building um

766
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:25,180
there's a book off oh no sorry the book off is the one that
i pointed out earlier uh there is a oh my gosh there is a

767
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:48,420
cosplay store there is uh what else is there um i'm trying
to remember I think this is where I think it was a pop-up

768
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:55,680
store though I couldn't remember but they did have like a
blue archive no not a blue archive I'm thinking of somewhere

769
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:05,940
else they had a they had just like a general dogen artist
pop-up which I didn't get to go to I was busy I was in a

770
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:21,000
hurry and I didn't get to go is that to who yes but there's
like a Toho corner in the store I'm the worst at describing

771
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:27,380
stuff one thing I do want to point out here that I like to
come here for though is the cure made cafe which if you're

772
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:36,060
wanting a made cafe that's not like your super high energy
made cafe just one it doesn't even have a table charge it's

773
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:46,160
very relaxed and chill it's the cure made cafe they are
always doing a collaboration with some sort of anime or game

774
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:54,960
um so before you go i would check the schedule because you
know something stop stop looking over here stop stop looking

775
01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:15,800
over here stop stop look stop looking no no no take us to b1
what what you'll never go to the second floor.

776
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,920
You'll never go there.

777
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,580
Why do you think it's only one floor in men's goods is two
floors?

778
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,710
Actually, I'll also never go there because I'm not allowed,
I think.

779
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:42,150
I don't think I'm allowed on these floors.

780
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:45,350
I think it's only for guys to go to.

781
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:48,430
Which makes me even more curious.

782
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:50,490
I want to go even more now.

783
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:58,910
lingerie oh yeah i mean you can get that at like don quixote
too and stuff like they sometimes sell like really sexy

784
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:09,250
costumes and um um i'll be honest i've i've been in m's but
i've never been in love mercy because i'm shy i've been in

785
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:15,990
m's before love mercy has been here forever it's also like
one of those stores that's just been here in akiba forever

786
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:23,930
but i've never gone because i'm i'm shy okay i'm shy but i i
went to m I don't know.

787
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:26,490
Maybe because I went with some friends, you know.

788
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:29,650
Love Mercy is the same as Emzo.

789
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:31,430
Yeah, but I went with friends before.

790
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:35,510
Anyways, let me continue my wholesome talking about the Cure
Maid Cafe.

791
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:37,150
Oh, this is it right here.

792
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:46,070
Basically, you'll go up the escalator a couple times, a
couple floors, and you'll arrive on one floor, and...

793
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:47,710
You're up to...

794
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:48,650
Thank you!

795
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:50,290
What do you mean, Q?

796
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:52,930
What do you mean, Q?

797
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:59,070
What do you mean?

798
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:01,010
The...

799
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,710
What do you mean?

800
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:09,060
The...

801
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:09,380
The...

802
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,160
The...

803
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:11,740
The...

804
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:13,240
Stop, stop.

805
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:14,320
The floor...

806
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,800
The floor with the...

807
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:16,680
With the...

808
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,800
With the main cafe has...

809
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,300
Stop it!

810
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,180
It has...

811
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,680
Stop it right now!

812
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:39,790
Do you want this tour or not?

813
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:40,490
Huh?

814
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:42,430
Do you want this tour or not?

815
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:43,850
Oh my god.

816
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:44,890
Oh my god.

817
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:45,430
ARK!

818
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:46,090
Thank you for that.

819
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:46,890
I got super.

820
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:48,870
Loving the updated Akiba Tour.

821
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:52,770
Your original stream was what got me hooked on your channel
in the first place.

822
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:53,410
Glad you're back.

823
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:54,170
Thank you!

824
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:56,310
I hope one day I could...

825
01:03:56,310 --> 01:04:03,990
Well, you know, not myself walking around in Akiba, but if
someone walked around Akiba went for me and I got to talk

826
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:05,430
about it and stuff on stream.

827
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:07,170
I hope one day I can do something like that.

828
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:09,050
It'd be really fun, I think.

829
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:11,490
Oh, what was I saying?

830
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:17,670
Oh, you go here on your, you go up the escalator a couple
floors.

831
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:21,850
In front of you on the right will be Kiramade Cafe.

832
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:23,750
Across from it will be the Cospa.

833
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:26,810
To the left of it will be an extension of the Cospa.

834
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:28,430
It's like a different

835
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:33,990
is also the cosplay store.

836
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:35,750
Let's get out of here.

837
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:36,570
I'm...

838
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:37,230
I'm...

839
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:37,870
I'm...

840
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:40,170

Matsukio is a chain.

860
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:49,530
It's nothing special.

861
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,570
It's not Akiba special or anything.

862
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:53,770
It's just a drugstore.

863
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:56,490

877
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:23,690
Will we be transported to nighttime with all the guys
standing around?

878
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:25,730
Okay, we're going.

879
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:28,370
Wait, is it, it's Idol Master now?

880
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:38,350
And Laplace, Laplace Sama, what is the, um, it's like
Shadowverse or something?

881
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:39,510
What is that?

882
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:40,790
Oh.

883
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:42,670
Yes, it is.

884
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:47,370
What's so funny is...

885
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:48,850
So yeah, see?

886
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:49,990
We're back at Akiba Station.

887
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:50,490
Woohoo!

888
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:51,570
It's so funny.

889
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:55,870
These advertisements for like...

890
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:56,450
Oh gosh.

891
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:58,370
Every time that I've gone back to Akiba...

892
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:03,590
They're Arknights here, but right now they're usually Blue
Archive advertisements.

893
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:05,110
So...

894
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:08,350
I guess...

895
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:10,970
I guess Blue Archive took over

896
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:27,040
But this is the other side Oh remember when we were trying
to go to school This is the UDX building It's the school

897
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:35,840
that the girls The rival girls go to and love live There's a
bunch of restaurants and stuff in there Over here is the

898
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:45,280
Tamashi Nation store Which I recommend checking out 100%
Because they sometimes they'll have like um how do i

899
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:53,520
describe it it's not like a pop-up it's like almost it
almost feels like a museum like they'll have like uh like

900
01:08:53,520 --> 01:09:06,840
sometimes it'll be like an exhibit of macross and it'll show
like a bunch of their old macross figures and the the the um

901
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:17,520
timeline of macross and stuff like that um things like that
so um they'll have like like one time i went and there was

902
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,240

Thank you, Ghoststalker.

907
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:50,400
Yes, TM Revolution.

908
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,860
They had the costume.

909
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:59,660
They had the TM Revolution, like the Hot Limit song costume
there.

910
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:05,060
So it was, I was just like, whoa, I'm pretty sure I have a
picture somewhere.

911
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:06,000
There's a coffee.

912
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,380
There's a coffee cafe here.

913
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,280
There's also a revolving sushi place that has been here
forever.

914
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:14,580
It's very small.

915
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:20,320
Um, but if you are like, there's a sushi dough, like right
over here.

916
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:22,720
Um, and a hamazushi.

917
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:23,720
Wait, is that still there?

918
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:24,320
The hamazushi?

919
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:26,360
Actually, I'm not sure.

920
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:27,300
I don't remember.

921
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:35,160
But if you're wanting a sushi place, and those, um, the
sushi dough, and maybe the hamazushi are busy, there's also

922
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:35,900
a sushi place.

923
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:36,820
That's a rotating sushi.

924
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:37,840
Right there!

925
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:42,300
So, the atore.

926
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,100
Oh yeah, here, there's the sushi though.

927
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,480
It's kind of in the basement, right?

928
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:50,960
Oh, wait, where'd it go?

929
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,040
Is it over here?

930
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:54,800
Oh, there it is.

931
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:56,720
Yeah, it's in the basement.

932
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,580
So, let another drugstore.

933
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,300
They're everywhere, the drugstores.

934
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,420
Why are you...

935
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:07,840
Wait, you're...

936
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:08,200
You're...

937
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,000
You're...

938
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:30,940
You're an otaku, that galah um giggle here um this one has
like uh the i'm pretty sure it's this one i don't i'm not i

939
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:38,400
don't think the other ones have it as much but this one has
like the gundam pods if i remember correctly i don't sorry

940
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:45,100
not You can correct me if I'm wrong about that.

941
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,000
But, uh...

942
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,880
The Gundam Tide Pods, exactly.

943
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,000
Um, let's actually go down here.

944
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,060
Because this is the Gigo.

945
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:58,720
I mentioned earlier how...

946
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:00,360
Um...

947
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:03,040
It is this road, right?

948
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,180
Hold on.

949
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,060
Let me get my bearings.

950
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,320
Yes, it's right here.

951
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:07,700
It's not open right now.

952
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,840
But this is where, um, they do...

953
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:10,980
You can kind of see it.

954
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:12,220
They do the...

955
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:12,620
Is that it?

956
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:13,320
Actually, no.

957
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,000
I think that's K.

958
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,660
I think that's a reflection of KFC.

959
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:16,740
Never mind.

960
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:20,560
Wait.

961
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:21,520
Is that?

962
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,000
It says KFC.

963
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:25,200
It says KFC, but the sign...

964
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,400
Is it reflecting this one?

965
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:33,080
It's reflecting KFC, but this is not the KFC.

966
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:34,880
That's kind of confusing.

967
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,800
This is where they do the Tayaki is what I was trying to
say.

968
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,240
So it's like themed Tayaki, which is kind of fun.

969
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:46,100
Um, so it like, uh, um, I'm trying to think of what it was.

970
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,840
It's been Love Live before.

971
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:53,900
Um, uh, it's been one week since you're looking at me.

972
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,620
They have Hollow Live 5th gen right now.

973
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,420
Oh, really nice.

974
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,000
Nice, nice.

975
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:03,300
Sega Notayaki.

976
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,500
Um, unfortunately now it's Gigo Notayaki.

977
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:09,640
But...

978
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,820
Um, yes, they did do Sonic before.

979
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:14,080
That was the other one I was thinking of.

980
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:17,300
So.

981
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:23,100
Um, you can, you can get some Tayaki here.

982
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,120
Yes, ah, I remember the Persona 3 one.

983
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:26,700
Yes, yes, yes.

984
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:27,440
And Vispo.

985
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:27,980
Mm-hmm.

986
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:31,040
Well, I don't know if the Vispo, the Tayaki was Vispo.

987
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:35,740
But, uh, there's an anime, anime, anime, anime.

988
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:39,000
An Anisong cafe here called Guild.

989
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:45,380
I know friends that I've been, I personally have not, so I
can't tell you how it works.

990
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,720
I mean, there's just hobby shops everywhere.

991
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,360
Like, I haven't been everywhere, so I'm so sorry.

992
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:53,240
You know, I'm a fake fan.

993
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,520
Not qualified to give this tour.

994
01:13:56,420 --> 01:14:02,580
But, um, there's also another, there's actually several
Annie Song cafes and bars in Akiba.

995
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:10,220
Um, another account called Alchemist, which, um, is close.

996
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:13,780
closer to Yodobashi Camera, actually.

997
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:17,400
That one's Alchemist.

998
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,880
And then, what was the other one?

999
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:25,020
It was another one that I also haven't been to before, but
my friend recommended it, so I'm gonna go next time.

1000
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:27,740
I can't remember it, though.

1001
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,760
How dare the tour guide has not been into literally every
store.

1002
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,580
Also, this Gigo, the last time I came, I get...

1003
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:48,900
might be new or it might have been a one-time thing but i
think they do like um there's crane games on these floors

1004
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:58,060
and then on the top floor there was an event space where
they had a steinsgate um a steinsgate collab uh and they had

1005
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:06,260
like little standies and they had exclusive merch and um i
got this super duper cute block calendar that i have on my

1006
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:17,480
desk now it's so cute um so But, you know, Gigo is doing
well, and I can appreciate that.

1007
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,500
It feels like almost like Sega never left, almost.

1008
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,000
Because they're still at it.

1009
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:25,400
They're still at it.

1010
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:28,080
Even though it's so sad.

1011
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:29,860
And there's a KFC here.

1012
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,180

There will be maids trying to stop you at every stop.

1021
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,420
They'll be like do you want to come to our maid cafe?

1022
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,820
Oh, how does a ninja girl maid cafe sound?

01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,480
Oh, do you want to come to our maid?

1024
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:32,660
Right here?

1025
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:40,540
I don't know if they do it so much anymore, but this is
where this is where maid dreaming is one of the maid

1026
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:41,620
dreaming locations is.

1027
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:46,140
And sometimes the girls will I don't, like I said, I don't
know if they do it so much anymore, but they used to come

1028
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:56,680
out onto this little, um, onto this little balcony and like
Dance and like kind of try and entice people from above Like

1032
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:10,720

1035
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:57,270

war anime i'm pretty sure this is what the street that I

1036
01:17:57,270 --> 01:18:05,510
think it was because like I said like there's the Kotobuki
awe I think this is the one that it's supposed to be I might

1037
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:11,110
be wrong though but I think this is the one I was like wait

also Mellon books on Mellon books the entrance is actually
on the oh on the other side you can go through this is an

1039
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:30,190
arcade you can cut through it or you can just walk around
here and i'll show you um but akiba all akibaos are also all

1040
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:37,370
over akiba they're um electronic stores they have really
cheap electronic stuff so um yeah you can see the balcony

1041
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:49,490
here it's very cute and here we have a kotobukiya yahoo
kotobukiya is so so great why is everything closed how early

1042
01:18:49,490 --> 01:19:00,210
did they film this i wonder um The Kotobukiya on the first
floor, you can get like Final Fantasy stuff.

1043
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:03,170
There's a little bit of Hollow Life stuff.

1044
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:05,530
There's a big Niji-sanji section.

1045
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:08,190
On the second floor, there's...

1046
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:12,110
What I really love about Kotobukiya is getting the stuff
like for storing my figures.

1047
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:15,730
It's like...

1048
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:17,570
Oh yeah, the Tales of stuff, yeah.

1049
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:19,170
Though the Tales of...

1050
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:21,530
They used to have like a really dedicated Tales of section.

1051
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:23,750
I don't think that is around anymore.

1052
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:32,150
um all the vtuber stuff on the third floor now oh really
that must have been actually i don't think i went the last

1053
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:42,930
time i oh yeah there remember how i said places in akiba or
places in japan open late and close early opens at 12 opens

1054
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:54,930
at 12 and then opens i mean closes probably at like seven
gosh it's so early so open so late hololive on the top Oh,

1055
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:57,050
thanks for letting me know.

1056
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:03,210
It drives me mad.

1057
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:04,030
Me too.

1058
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:05,930
It's so frustrating.

1059
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:14,550
Because of course you're wanting to make the most out of
your day and visit the most places as possible, but it kind

1060
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:16,750
of makes it hard when they don't open until noon.

1061
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:24,390
But yeah, I like to get the stuff like they have the stand.

1062
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:25,910
these for your figures.

1063
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:31,090
They have like acrylic boxes and stuff for storing your
figures.

1064
01:20:31,190 --> 01:20:32,190
They got a lot of stuff in here.

1065
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:33,150
I really like it.

1066
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:36,910
They got stuff for model kits and everything like that
paints.

1067
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:38,970
I mean, they're not the only place, of course.

1068
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:39,890
Oh, excuse me.

1069
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:44,390
They're not the only place, of course, but sorry, just going
back to the main road real quick.

1070
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:48,370
If you go in through here, this is where Melon Books is.

1071
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:56,890
You'll pass some crane games on the right, and there's a
couple of gotcha pon that Always steal your money!

1072
01:20:58,130 --> 01:20:59,090
Melon Books!

1073
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:01,370
Fix your gacha pawn, please!

1074
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:10,050
I had to try, I tried, oh my god, I tried helping some poor
guy who, who got his money stuck in the gacha pawn.

1075
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:14,590
And it happened to me and my friends some time ago too.

1076
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:19,110
And like, we kind of like just bam, bam, bam on the gacha a
little bit.

1077
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:20,370
Just a little bit.

1078
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:23,310
And it eventually came out.

1079
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:31,410
and they're not like super cheap either they're like 400 yen
they were like some blue archive uh keychain like little

1080
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:38,490
acrylic acrylic keys and i was just like i was like trying
to help the guy i was just like uh i was like here let me

1081
01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:45,090

i was like but it was like when i when it happened to me

1082
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:52,410
before it was kind of late at night so there weren't so many
people around so we were like okay with like kind of hitting

1083
01:21:52,410 --> 01:22:01,330
the the maybe it's broken because so many people keep
hitting it because it keeps eating their money but anyway do

1084
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:11,270
not use the gotcha pon there because it's actual gotcha it's
you might just get nothing so don't don't do it even if you

1085
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:21,270
see the blue archive or the genshin impact don't do it i in
the end i couldn't even help the guy i was like i'm so sorry

1086
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:37,190
i i i i can't get it out he was like it's okay but I really
tried to help him out sorry guy nah I'd still do it last

No.

1118
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:31,200
So sad.

1119
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:31,860
He's not.

1120
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,660
I never even noticed the candy.

1121
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:37,620
I was just going to see snake.

1122
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:41,720
Cute.

1123
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,120
Here is Akiba.

1124
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,080
Oh, wait.

01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:48,820
What date is it?

1126
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:49,460
Whoa.

1127
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:50,220
Wait a second.

01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:52,520
2022.

1129
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:53,400
But backstage.

1130
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:55,320
Pass was already...

1131
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,920
Backstage Pass was already closed by then.

1132
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,860
Like maybe they just didn't get rid of the sign.

1133
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:03,740
This is Akiba Culture Zone.

1134
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:07,860
Which I'm just gonna show you from the back here real quick.

1135
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:11,120
They have a ton of stores in here.

1136
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:16,040
This is where all the maids will try to bombard you with...

1137
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:17,120
Hey, come to my cafe.

1138
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:19,240
Hey, how does this cafe sound?

1139
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:20,820
Hey, how does that cafe sound?

1140
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:22,700
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1141
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:25,960
Trying to get a good view of Culture Zone real quick.

1142
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:26,740
Hold on.

1143
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,920
Maybe here?

1144
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,200
This is good.

1145
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:38,320
So Culture Zone is this big building.

1146
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:39,520
It's really awesome.

1147
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:43,800
The first floor is Dashinban.

1148
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:44,900
Oh, no, sorry.

1149
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,420
The second floor is Dashinban.

1150
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:49,080
I think the first floor is also Dashinban, though, isn't it?

1151
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:49,700
Yeah.

1152
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,500
First and second floor, Dashinban.

1153
01:27:51,500 --> 01:28:00,220
the first floor is more like regular anime goods and then
the second floor is like dojin and a little bit more yabai

1154
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:14,720
stuff thank you still not as much as a as an overpriced scam
as mashak so maybe who knows but um yeah you can get figures

1155
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:21,660
and anime like you know I say anime goods there's like
youtuber stuff down here too but the more yabai stuff is on

1156
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:24,040
the second floor if you're looking for that.

1157
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:28,840
The third floor is like a mishmash of a ton of different
stores.

1158
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:35,000
You have like the Trio is an idol store, which I like to go
frequent.

1159
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:40,940
You have card shops, you have figure shops, you have a lot
of different kind of stuff.

1160
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,480
Same on the fourth floor.

1161
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,500
The fifth floor is the at-home cafe.

1162
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:50,900
One of them in Akihabara.

1163
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:58,640
there's this one, there's a building of at-homes right over
here, and then there's one at Don Quixote.

1164
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:06,440
I honestly, this one is the biggest and the nicest, I
believe because it's the newest.

1165
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,120
But what's at-home cafe?

1166
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:11,060
It's a maid cafe.

1167
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:12,700
It's a maid cafe.

1168
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:13,420
It's a maid cafe.

1169
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:15,160
I've been to this at-home.

1170
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:16,280
How long?

1171
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:18,120
How long of a wait?

1172
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:19,680
Did you wait for?

1173
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:21,480
Because...

1174
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:30,000
what's iTube studio I'll get to that once again um because
this at home cafe I've tried going so many times oh my gosh

1175
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:42,040
mini scouters thank you for the 50 gifted thank you so much
thank you so much I've been I've tried to go to this at home

1176
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:52,240
cafe several times now several times but the weight has
always been like two hours it is ridiculous i went to the

1177
01:29:52,240 --> 01:30:03,300
one over here um which is also seven floors and the weight
there was about an hour and a half

1178
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:16,640
actually no it was more like an hour it was more like an
hour yeah but it was still very very very long time um which

1179
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:29,760
we probably should have done a reservation but we just
didn't um yeah how long is the wait for cure made like zero

1180
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:36,680
minutes you can usually just i've never had a wait i've
always just been able to walk up frog welcome to membership

1181
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:37,280
thank you

1182
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:49,920
You know, at home cafe, I would recommend probably going to
the Don Quixote one because that one seems to always have

1183
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:53,500
the smallest line for if you're wanting to wait.

1184
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:57,520
But it's also, I'm pretty sure, also pretty small.

1185
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:59,560
I've been there like just a handful of times.

1186
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:03,900
And I'll show you Don Quixote later.

1187
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:06,980
The one in Akiba.

1188
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:11,680
Since it's so packed, is it expensive?

1189
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:23,160
it's it's really just high quality like um the kind of
experience that you get is really high quality so um you

1190
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:30,160
know it's really popular with guys and girls with like all
sorts of people and then of course because it's like one of

1191
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:37,200
the more popular maid cafes it's also very popular with with
foreigners so um you just get like a ton of people going

1192
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:44,900
there all the time so if you go to at home cafe prepare to
wait unless you do a reservation

1193
01:31:49,060 --> 01:32:00,800
but is high quality good for maid cafes I think it depends
on what kind of experience you want at the top here is this

1194
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:10,700
place called iTube studio it used to be an idol cafe that I
actually auditioned for called Backstage Pass, which I made

1195
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:14,680
it into, but then I turned it down because I wanted to focus
more on my studies.

1196
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,820
But now, as you can see here, the sign was over here.

1197
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:23,680
Hold on.

1198
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:24,200
Meow.

1199
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:25,940
Meow.

1200
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:27,520
Right here.

1201
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:31,340
This was Backstage Pass.

1202
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:33,340
This is Horiuchi Kaori.

1203
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:34,980
Oh, gosh.

1204
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:35,640
What was her name?

1205
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:40,140
There's Moyazu.

1206
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:46,880
She's a really popular, she's a really popular mukbang
YouTuber.

1207
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:49,360
She eats so much food.

1208
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:51,740
She eats so much food!

1209
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:56,060
Um Oh my gosh, what was your name?

1210
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:58,500
Was it Yui?

1211
01:32:58,960 --> 01:32:59,700
I don't remember.

1212
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:03,760
But yeah, they don't have my Oshi up here.

1213
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:05,420
But that's okay, I think she had already graduated.

1214
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:14,820
And so it was this, at the cafe, actually produced by the
same person that produced uh does she eat shiroko she has

1215
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:29,720
she has she has oh my gosh yeah she has she did a video
recently i mean shirako no wait shiroko shiroko from

1216
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:39,540
Shiroko No, don't eat Shiroko from Blue Archive

1217
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:48,020
What was I saying?

1218
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:50,620
What was I saying?

1219
01:33:54,280 --> 01:34:06,520
Oh, it was produced by the same person that produced It was
Morning Musume project so um yeah their songs were very like

1220
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:20,240
pretty uh what's the word like hello project like and um
unfortunately it's closed now which is so sad because i

1221
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:32,620
would visit very often and it turned into this i tube studio
which was like an amalgamation of backstage And iTunes

1222
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:39,080
Studio, which was just a cafe of YouTubers, I never went
because I was so confused by it.

1223
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:40,920
I did not understand.

1224
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:48,140
It was just a cafe where you can go and talk to YouTubers or
girls that were wanting to be popular YouTubers.

1225
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:49,300
It was very weird.

1226
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:54,340
And the inside of the cafe used to be so iconic for
backstage.

1227
01:34:55,540 --> 01:35:00,180
And then they tore it all apart for this ugly, like, it
looked like a Mac store.

1228
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:12,100
um but itube studio has also since shut down so so we don't
even have i don't know um i don't know what will pop up

1229
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:22,020
there next i'll be on the lookout i suppose oh you were
telling us about how you're cute enough to get accepted into

1230
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:36,180
an idol group no no oh my gosh my audition for it was so it
was so embarrassing um i i uh they actually had it not at

1231
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:46,800
the cafe itself um it was like at some separate building
which i might be able to find probably not though it was a

1232
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:58,320
long time ago um but i went and um the guy the guy that was
like interviewing some of us he was just like wow a

1233
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:04,200
foreigner and i was And he was like asking me how I got into
backstage and stuff like that.

1234
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:09,080
I had seen them at an idol show and really started to like
them.

1235
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:16,100
But I also did like some dance covers of some backstage
songs.

1236
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:17,280
So they were like, whoa.

1237
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,980
She really likes it.

1238
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:23,060
She already knows the choreography.

1239
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:25,340
So I showed him that.

1240
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:29,900
And then they took us.

1241
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:34,700
He was like showing the other people though in my videos and
I was really embarrassed.

1242
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:47,580
But then we go to the actual like audition part which was
three people sitting in a dance studio.

1243
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:50,120
Like you know there was the mirrored walls and everything.

1244
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:56,340
And we all sat along the wall and they called us up one by
one and they asked us to sing something.

1245
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:04,900
like, okay, and I was like, I've never done an audition
before, especially in Japan.

1246
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:06,940
I've never done any sort of audition like this.

1247
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:10,060
I've never done an audition in Japan.

1248
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:13,420
I've never auditioned for an idol group, so I was like,
super duper nervous.

1249
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:14,640
Acapella?

1250
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:15,600
Yes, acapella.

1251
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:20,880
And, um, so I was just like, okay, I'm just gonna follow
what the other girls do.

1252
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:35,060
And unfortunately, I could not follow what the other girls
did because they called me first and I was like okay and so

1253
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:41,000
I stand up and I'm standing in the middle of the room and
they asked me some questions and they're just like they

1254
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:48,940
asked me about like dancing and singing and just you know
why I wanted to join backstage and I was like this and this

1255
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:54,400
and this and that and that and that and then they were like
okay now sing something for us.

1256
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:59,380
And I was like, um, anything?

1257
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:03,020
Sorry, I'm cringing right now.

1258
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:05,860
I'm cringing right now so bad.

1259
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:08,820
I don't know how I got it.

1260
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:11,540
Because they were like, yeah, anything.

1261
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:23,420
And

1262
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:34,000
I don't even, I just go, oh, oh, oh, oh, and they were like,
thank you, you can sit down.

1263
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:45,300
And then, I'm, like, sitting there, like, okay, I hope I did
that right.

1264
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:48,580
And then the next girl goes up, and they ask her the, like,
similar questions.

1265
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,580
And then they're like, okay, sing something for us.

1266
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:55,160
And she has a whole dance and song prepared, and she's just,
like, sitting there.

1267
01:38:55,180 --> 01:39:11,420
the song, the actual, she's actually singing, she's actually
singing a song with words and and a melody and like doing a

1268
01:39:11,420 --> 01:39:13,480
dance to go along with it.

1269
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:29,360
And I was like, ah, it's in that moment I felt everything
drain from my face and I was like, I was like oh that's what

1270
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:38,600
they meant I don't know why at the moment I thought that
they just wanted to hear a little bit of my you actually

1271
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:39,800
sang Hamtaro didn't you?

1272
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:51,480
That would have been probably better than what I did I just
sat there I was like I messed up I messed up I messed up and

1273
01:39:51,480 --> 01:40:06,300
then when I got the email that was like we got you in I was
like like what how how did i pass part of me part of me a

1274
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:15,740
little bit regrets uh not joining because it probably would
have been a good experience to um to join but like i said i

1275
01:40:15,740 --> 01:40:23,800
wanted to focus on my studies and another part was i was so
nervous i was i had no confidence in my japanese like that i

1276
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:31,940
Oh my gosh, I'm going to get yelled at every day at work
because they're going to say, they're going to be like, why

1277
01:40:31,940 --> 01:40:33,100
didn't you understand?

1278
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:35,660
And I'll be like, go man, no stop.

1279
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:39,620
But it's okay.

1280
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:47,800
It was still an interesting experience being able to, being
evil.

1281
01:40:48,260 --> 01:40:55,840
Being able to even attempt an audition for a idol group.

1282
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:57,020
Well, it wasn't an idol group.

1283
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:59,780
an idol cafe, being evil.

1284
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:09,320
Anyway, this is an Akiba tour, everybody.

1285
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:11,280
So sorry about that little tangent.

1286
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:14,100
We have a figure shop here.

1287
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:15,880
There's so many.

1288
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:20,340
If I point out every figure shop in Akiba, we'll be here
forever.

1289
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:22,880
Let's go down here a little bit.

1290
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:25,560
This is the...

1291
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:27,060
You can't see it.

1292
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:29,200
This is the other at-home cafe.

1293
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:32,840
It's all these floors.

1294
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:35,160
All of these floors are at-home cafe.

1295
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:36,820
So it's kind of cool.

1296
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:39,860
There's a gamer lounge down here.

1297
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:45,380
You have yellow submarine, which is just like a hobby shop.

1298
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:47,100
You have trading cards.

1299
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:50,660
You have the ami-ami store here as well.

1300
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:54,840
Gamers only.

They have, they sell, it's like a, It's like a...

1302
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:00,080
What's the word?

They have like monitors, gaming monitors and stuff like
that.

1304
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,220
Checking my feet at how cute she is.

1305
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,380
You cannot stop me talking.

1306
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:07,300
What do you mean?

1307
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:10,960
Why?

1308
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,320
What do you mean by that?

1309
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:31,880
I'll be honest, I've never had a reason to go into this
building.

1310
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:37,560
There's like one of those other tourist spots here, like
those tourist stores.

1311
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:44,640
a bunch of luggage that's all i know but i've never had a
reason to go into this building so i don't actually really

01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:07,260
There's another giggle down there.

1316
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:12,520
This one is the giggle that has the cafe in it.

1317
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:12,920
Wait.

1318
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:14,120
Is it this one?

1319
01:43:14,420 --> 01:43:14,980
Is it Sango?

1320
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:16,300
Sango clan?

1321
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:17,280
Or is it the one down there?

1322
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:19,380
I think it's this one.

1323
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:22,440
I'm pretty sure it's this one.

1324
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:25,240
It's the one that has the cafe in it as well.

1325
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:27,320
Yeah, collab cafe.

1326
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:28,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1327
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:33,260
So, um, usually though these require a reservation.

1328
01:43:33,820 --> 01:43:35,140
At least they used to in the past.

1329
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:37,080
I haven't been to one in a long time.

1330
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:42,940
But it's an arcade and also that last time I was here, there
was a Vespo.

1331
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:46,540
Vespo collab cafe and stuff.

1332
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:56,960
Mulan, Mulan is just another, I'd say touristy store, but
it's really just like used figures and things like that.

1333
01:43:58,220 --> 01:44:02,600
You have a Yoshinoa, which is Gyu Don.

1334
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:04,100
You have a Gogokare.

1335
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:08,120
Um...

1336
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:11,580
Uh, there's nothing really over here.

1337
01:44:12,740 --> 01:44:15,520
I'm gonna go back down this way, though.

1338
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:18,890
So here's the Kotobuki app.

1339
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,240
Oh, yeah.

1340
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:29,440
Esports Lounge!

1341
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:30,560
It says it right there.

1342
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:32,420
There you go.

1343
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:34,020
Esports Lounge.

1344
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:35,060
I wish it was open, though.

1345
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,240
I wish she could see inside.

1346
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:38,240
Oh, wait, maybe from here.

1347
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:39,680
Oh, just kidding.

1348
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:41,400
Here.

1349
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:45,740
If I'm going too fast, just let me know.

1350
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:48,160
If you're like, Mint, I can't see.

1351
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:50,040
Why?

1352
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:51,660
Always someone.

1353
01:44:52,780 --> 01:44:53,820
It looks cool, though, I think.

1354
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:55,920
I like, it looks cool in there.

1355
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:08,160
I've always wanted to go to this place because it's like a
ghost, a ghost-themed, like a Chinese ghost themed cafe.

1356
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,280
Maybe I'll go next time.

1357
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:14,160
Sometimes I'm worried because sometimes they're less cafe
and more bar like.

1358
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:17,500
And those two places, one, tend to be more expensive.

1359
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:25,180
And two, I don't really drink, so I'm just kind of like,
what will I get?

1360
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:27,760
What will I get?

1361
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:30,700
Mmm!

1362
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:33,280
Yangxi.

1363
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:42,300
like these billboards that are all like different types of
cafes so you have this one which this one I've always I'm

1364
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:49,000
gonna go this to this one next time because hold on sorry
I'm skipping ahead a little bit oh wait hold on no no there

1365
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:58,280
we go can you see it from here yeah it's all like all this
foresty everything up here it's all these it's like this

1366
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:02,000
foresty like it looks looks so cool in there.

1367
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:04,240
Witch's Garden.

1368
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:07,620
But you can see here, it's 800 yen.

1369
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,080
Sorry for the giant arrow.

1370
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:13,820
It's 800 yen for 30 minutes.

1371
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:14,800
Oh wait!

1372
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:16,860
Oh wait, that's soft drink Nomi Hodae.

1373
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:18,180
That's soft drink all you can drink.

1374
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:18,940
Wait, yeah.

1375
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:20,320
All you can drink, soft drink.

1376
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,740
I can't see the... There's a course here.

1377
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:24,180
I thought that was the table charge.

1378
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:25,520
Oh, maybe not.

1379
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:29,240
Alcohol Nomi Hodae is...

1380
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:37,340
But 800 yen for 30 minutes how much are you drinking how
much even soft drinks I don't think I can get through even

1381
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:42,960
like three soft drinks in 30 minutes you know that's like

1382
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:54,580
sucking it down I know right I don't think I can get through
so much soft drinks wouldn't be worth it but for the alcohol

1383
01:46:54,580 --> 01:47:03,900
it's 1500 yen for 30 minutes I wonder what the table charge
is here There's another maid cafe.

1384
01:47:04,100 --> 01:47:05,780
This is kind of a maid cafe building.

1385
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:17,540
I'm so sad because this Lawson used to be, it used to be a
dragon quest themed Lawson and when you go inside it would

1386
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:25,880
go and when you left it would go or it would play another
sound and they played like the dragon quest theme inside and

1387
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:26,100
everything.

1388
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:32,500
But I found, I don't know if it's permanent, but I found
another Shibuya.

1389
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:37,000
Just my last trip and I was like, oh my gosh, did it move
here?

1390
01:47:38,060 --> 01:47:39,240
I had never seen it before.

1391
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:40,340
I don't know if it was there before.

1392
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:42,820
They still have one in Shibuya.

1393
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:43,540
Yeah, right?

1394
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:44,580
Was it there before?

1395
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:45,720
Hmm.

1396
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:47,220
Anyway, okay.

1397
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:48,720
I got a little ahead of myself.

1398
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:49,620
Let's head back.

1399
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,080
Giving a tour is hard because there's so much.

1400
01:47:57,260 --> 01:47:58,360
There's so many roads.

1401
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:09,880
So this is where the chubby used to be it was this building
I believe this is where the chubby girl cafe used ah you can

1402
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:21,800
see it Shangri-La yes but it is not here anymore so if you
put in Shangri-La into Google Maps it might take you here it

1403
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:32,860
is not here anymore so do not come over here I will show you
where the new location is I'll show you where It still

1404
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:33,220
exists.

1405
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:34,100
Stop saying no.

1406
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:35,580
It still exists.

1407
01:48:36,460 --> 01:48:37,980
It's just not in this location.

1408
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:38,860
It moved.

1409
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:42,540
It moved.

1410
01:48:42,740 --> 01:48:43,100
It moved.

1411
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:44,300
But yeah.

1412
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:46,900
Let's see.

1413
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:49,960
Down here is some more maid cafes, as you can see.

1414
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:51,320
Here.

1415
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:53,180
There's a whole building of them.

1416
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:56,000
There are maid cafes everywhere.

1417
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:57,820
Oh, Akihama are so perfect.

1418
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:01,300
There's a Coco's restaurant down here, which is just a...

1419
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:06,460
Just a family restaurant, but they have...

1420
01:49:06,460 --> 01:49:08,680
They have quesadillas.

1421
01:49:11,380 --> 01:49:19,220
And here, if you see the hello storage, that means you've
reached Akiba Zetai Ryōiki, which is one of my favorite maid

1422
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:19,800
cafes.

1423
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:21,540
It's super duper cute.

1424
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:23,980
The girls are very cute.

1425
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:25,840
The performances are always so good.

1426
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:31,740
So I recommend Zetai Ryōiki very much.

1427
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,100
I love their uniforms.

1428
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:36,960
Me too.

1429
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:42,540
There's also more stuff down this street, but we'll go down
here later.

1430
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:45,740
We'll go down here later.

1431
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:51,280
So many maids, I know.

1432
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:52,780
Oh, actually here.

1433
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:54,440
Oh, oh.

1434
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:57,600
This place is a Warhammer store.

1435
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:01,560
Which I was so shocked to see.

1436
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:04,420
I was like, I messaged Matara immediately.

1437
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:07,780
I was like, Matara, there's a warhammer store in Akiba.

1438
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:09,460
And she was like, yeah, I know.

1439
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:12,800
I was like, you knew?

1440
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:16,020
You knew something about Akiba that I didn't.

1441
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:21,560
But it's right next to Akiba Culture Zone.

1442
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:24,420
So, uh...

1443
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:30,020
Matara knows more about Akiba than me!

1444
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:33,360
Yeah, but,

1445
01:50:36,710 --> 01:50:38,010
um...

1446
01:50:38,010 --> 01:50:38,370
Yeah.

1447
01:50:39,430 --> 01:50:42,730
Um, I've never been in, because I don't know anything about
Warhammer.

1448
01:50:43,430 --> 01:50:44,670
It also says it's a cafe.

1449
01:50:44,970 --> 01:50:48,150
I'm more curious about the cafe than anything.

1450
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:51,230
Let's see, which way do we...

1451
01:50:51,230 --> 01:50:55,570
Let's go down the main street a little bit, and then I'll
show you more of the back street stuff.

1452
01:50:56,050 --> 01:50:57,630
Back street stuff.

1453
01:50:58,210 --> 01:50:58,690
Alright!

1454
01:50:59,270 --> 01:51:00,810
Aw, look at all these people.

1455
01:51:02,110 --> 01:51:02,590
Um...

1456
01:51:02,590 --> 01:51:03,750
This building here...

1457
01:51:04,210 --> 01:51:14,810
sometimes they do events down here um like like game
festivals or really anything i've seen concerts there i've

1458
01:51:14,810 --> 01:51:26,470
seen figures there i've seen like thomacy nation stuff stuff

1459
01:51:26,470 --> 01:51:30,310
see sometimes um there's a bick camera here oh yeah

1460
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:39,250
I showed you the other McDonald's by Yodobashi camera.

1461
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:42,090
It was the one, it's over there.

1462
01:51:45,090 --> 01:51:47,510
This one's also McDonald's.

1463
01:51:53,330 --> 01:51:54,490
Hello, Shibuya.

1464
01:51:57,830 --> 01:51:58,530
Hello.

1465
01:52:02,390 --> 01:52:04,110
This is the trip.

1466
01:52:04,210 --> 01:52:07,550
If you're lost, by the way, the train station is right here.

1467
01:52:08,650 --> 01:52:10,910
This is the UDX building that I showed before.

1468
01:52:11,010 --> 01:52:12,030
It has some...

1469
01:52:13,470 --> 01:52:16,510
Sometimes they do, like, events and promo things here as
well.

1470
01:52:17,090 --> 01:52:24,670
Like, I saw a big pop-up for the new Idol Master, the school
Idol Master.

1471
01:52:25,550 --> 01:52:27,930
But down here, there's Tomashi Nations.

1472
01:52:28,570 --> 01:52:29,570
There's the train station.

1473
01:52:30,110 --> 01:52:32,510
We honestly haven't gotten that far at all.

1474
01:52:34,590 --> 01:52:42,650
There's so much to see in Akiba, we barely walked like two
feet away from the station.

1475
01:52:53,050 --> 01:52:54,170
Um, yeah.

1476
01:52:55,530 --> 01:52:57,150
Let's go back to the main road.

1477
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:04,070
You'll see a lot of people like taking pictures of like this
section.

1478
01:53:05,370 --> 01:53:17,050
of Akiba it's kind of like iconic for the at home poster and
then this whatever place the the pond shop that I'm always

1479
01:53:17,050 --> 01:53:25,250
like it always feels so out of place every time I see it um
and then there's always like a bunch of anime and game signs

1480
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:35,770
it's very it's this this scene is so Akihabara you know yeah
it it always reminds me of Dragon Ball too every time I see

1481

So yeah, BIC camera here, which has lots of great stuff.

01:53:43,990 --> 01:53:45,030
You can go anywhere.

1485
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:49,980
Meow.

showed earlier that turned into a sad, sad drugstore.

It is now here.

1488
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:03,080
This is where Toranoana was.

1489
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:05,160

1502
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:39,480
They're so annoying.

1503
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:44,120
They, I think they talk.

1504
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:50,540
I just don't know what they're saying because I try to
drain, I try to, I try to just tune them out.

1505
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:52,060
They're so, so.

01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:57,500
Hold on, let me see if I can find a picture.

1508
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:02,740
Taito Arcade, Taito Station Akihabara.

1509
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:06,180
I don't even know what to call them though.

1510
01:56:06,260 --> 01:56:08,080
Like, I have to find a really recent picture.

1511
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:10,380
Because...

1512
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:12,340
They are recent.

1513
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:16,080
They, and they, like, sit on top of the arcade machines.

1514
01:56:16,780 --> 01:56:17,000
They...

1515
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:17,280
Let me...

1516
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,520
Actually, I can draw a picture of them.

1517
01:56:18,620 --> 01:56:19,480
That might be easier.

1518
01:56:21,380 --> 01:56:22,880
I'm gonna draw a picture real quick.

1519
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:26,540
One second.

1520
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:30,420
Uh...

1521
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:33,000
Whoa, what the hell?

1522
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:34,960
Oh, there we go.

1523
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:41,880
So, they look like...

1524
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:43,000
Uh...

1525
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:43,660
They look...

1526
01:56:43,660 --> 01:56:45,420
They are...

1527
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:45,780
Oh, no.

1528
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:46,440
Whoops, my bad.

1529
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:47,600
This one.

1530
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:55,780
They have, like, this bulbous head and this tiny tube body.

1531
01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:58,980
They, like, have their little feet down here.

1532
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:00,620
They look like they could be from Petskop.

1533
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:02,940
And then they have eyes.

1534
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:04,120
Like, beady...

1535
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:05,700
Little stupid beady eyes.

1536
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:06,340
eyes.

1537
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:10,520
And then they have this dumb ass duck beak looking shit.

1538
01:57:11,140 --> 01:57:13,060
And then they have arms that do this.

1539
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:15,420
They go over their head.

1540
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:18,880
And they have giant clapping hands.

1541
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:22,580
And they're, they're, they, they're bright red.

1542
01:57:25,220 --> 01:57:25,900
Like that.

1543
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:32,120
And all they do, they, they talk, they open their mouths and

1544
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:42,780
And they clap their hands But there's three of them And they
don't shut up

1545
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:49,660
Hey, what's wrong with duck beaks?

1546
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,140
Oh, sorry, duck you

1547
01:57:56,580 --> 01:58:07,560
They even look annoying I know I want to punch them every
time And they're super loud They are, they're so loud So, I

1548
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:10,360
know one day they'll probably grow on me.

1549
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:17,540
One day, one day I'll like go back to Akiba and they'll be
gone and I'll be like, where's the clappy ducks?

1550
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:22,960
And I'll be so sad.

1551
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:28,740
I'll be like, I'll be like walking by the Taito arcade and
I'll be like, oh, it's so quiet.

1552
01:58:29,260 --> 01:58:32,380
And I'll look to the top of the arcade machine with wistful
eyes.

1553
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:35,220
And I'll just imagine them up there greeting me.

1554
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:40,360
I'll just be so sad.

1555
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:45,360
Be like, little clappy man, where did you go?

1556
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:50,400
My eyes will glaze over with tears.

1557
01:58:50,860 --> 01:58:56,080
They'll just, they'll be, and I'll like, I'll do like a sad
nod being like, yeah.

1558
01:58:57,680 --> 01:59:00,060
Yeah, I hope you're out there clapping in heaven.

1559
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:03,540
Me, me, me, me, me, me.

1560
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:20,480
The fact that I could draw it probably as accurate as I
could from memory just probably goes to oh oh oh oh it goes

1561
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:31,720
to show how much of an impact they've made on my afterlife
truly God okay anyway I could listen to you talk about Akima

1562
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:35,760
forever you're my favorite geography teacher Thank you,
student K-Barn.

1563
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:43,780

1564
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:44,960
Wait, actually?

1565
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:47,380

02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:42,940
There's no way.

1579
02:00:48,780 --> 02:00:52,880
It was exactly spot on, not a single detail off!

1580
02:00:55,530 --> 02:00:57,430
I have to buy one now.

1581
02:00:58,730 --> 02:01:01,090

Oh my gosh, I just realized I don't have my noise gate on.

1583
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:20,960
Big crappy.

1584
02:01:28,260 --> 02:01:29,620

1585
02:01:29,620 --> 02:01:30,100
I can't.

1586
02:01:31,060 --> 02:01:32,840
Seeing that just ruined my day.

1587
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:38,740
Seeing that just ruined my day.

1588
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:39,720
Oh my god.

1589
02:01:40,020 --> 02:01:40,260

02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:42,540
Lady Gaga.

1595
02:01:59,770 --> 02:02:00,070
Oh my god.

hurts imagine a horror game where you're chased by these

1597
02:02:17,210 --> 02:02:25,410
things you would hear it forever forever ago you would hear
it across the world it's clapping so hard it doesn't sound

1598
02:02:25,410 --> 02:02:31,670
like heaven is their final destination Oh, okay.

1599
02:02:33,310 --> 02:02:34,870
Okay, back to the tour.

1600
02:02:35,410 --> 02:02:36,890
We're doing a tour again, everybody.

1601
02:02:38,370 --> 02:02:39,930
Anyways, there's a tight-toe station there.

1602
02:02:41,310 --> 02:02:44,150
Again, it's just another, um...

1603
02:02:45,490 --> 02:02:46,450
Another, uh...

1604
02:02:46,450 --> 02:02:46,970
What's the word?

1605
02:02:47,190 --> 02:02:47,670
Arcade.

1606
02:02:48,090 --> 02:02:49,950
This building, I believe, is finished.

1607
02:02:50,670 --> 02:02:51,230
Is it not?

1608
02:02:53,730 --> 02:02:55,110
Am I making that up?

1609
02:02:56,210 --> 02:02:56,690
Maybe...

1610
02:02:57,630 --> 02:02:59,010
Am I making that up?

1611
02:02:59,110 --> 02:02:59,250
Wait.

1612
02:03:00,150 --> 02:03:08,970
another one no no I think this building is finished now yeah
I was finished right um yeah I remember because I went there

1613
02:03:08,970 --> 02:03:22,690
for a Tomie they were they did a Tomie collab and one of the
store it was like a pop-up stop so it was I I ended up not

1614
02:03:22,690 --> 02:03:27,010
getting anything I was so sad I forgot to go back and get
some some stuff but

1615
02:03:30,210 --> 02:03:47,730
yeah uh yes it's now um well the anime's here the anime I'm
pretty sure is still here I think it's just like a bunch of

1616
02:03:47,730 --> 02:03:53,670
random stores like there's a if I remember correctly there's
a cell phone store at the bottom and then it's like random

1617
02:03:53,670 --> 02:03:56,610
stuff and I think there's like a card shop in there as well

1618
02:03:59,770 --> 02:04:02,270
I don't quite remember exactly.

1619
02:04:04,170 --> 02:04:04,810
All that's in there.

1620
02:04:06,250 --> 02:04:07,690
But there's the animate here.

1621
02:04:08,990 --> 02:04:10,650
It's like these two buildings.

1622
02:04:12,810 --> 02:04:19,370
There are, if you go into this animate, this store has its
own elevator and this store has its own elevator.

1623
02:04:19,850 --> 02:04:21,010
And they do not connect.

1624
02:04:21,550 --> 02:04:23,850
So make sure you go in both.

1625
02:04:25,190 --> 02:04:35,070
They both have their own different staircases um I believe
this one on the top floor has uh this one I think this wait

1626
02:04:35,070 --> 02:04:44,890
is it this one that has the cafe or this one yeah it's
pretty inconvenient not gonna lie um but this one I think

1627
02:04:44,890 --> 02:04:51,790
has like the event stuff at the top floor here but the top
floor of this one has the yo star section and blue archive

1628
02:04:51,790 --> 02:05:02,910
and stuff so uh but one of them also has a cafe a small
little cafe um i say cafe it's more like snacks and drinks

1629
02:05:02,910 --> 02:05:11,150
and stuff um i was disappointed in the anime cafe yeah it's
not really a cafe it's like i said it's like snacks and

1630
02:05:11,150 --> 02:05:20,650
drinks los timbos thank you for the five gifted thank you
thank you thank you um but yeah so just be careful if you're

1631
02:05:20,650 --> 02:05:28,390
just like oh but i already went up all the floors but did
you go up this one as this one on the right also has more

1632
02:05:28,390 --> 02:05:41,110
like stuff for those interested in the BL variety and this
one is of others

1633
02:05:44,670 --> 02:05:59,150
let's see for those wondering Bao Bao yes this is the Misa
doll this is the the famous Wow, wow, Mr. Donuts!

1634
02:06:01,310 --> 02:06:04,730
So you can go here and you can sit up there and eat your
donuts.

1635
02:06:05,250 --> 02:06:12,870
And yeah, it's a great view because you get to see, you
know, so much of Akiva.

1636
02:06:13,090 --> 02:06:14,950
I mean, like the iconic stuff you can see.

1637
02:06:15,110 --> 02:06:16,230
Don Quixote, you can see.

1638
02:06:16,670 --> 02:06:21,230
Well, I don't want to sit there anymore because there's
demons afoot.

1639
02:06:22,530 --> 02:06:23,610
Or should I say a clap?

1640
02:06:24,390 --> 02:06:26,610
But yeah, there's a song.

1641
02:06:26,630 --> 02:06:27,570
off map here.

1642
02:06:28,350 --> 02:06:29,210
They have games.

1643
02:06:29,430 --> 02:06:32,310
They have used electronics, stuff like that.

1644
02:06:33,010 --> 02:06:33,570
But yeah, Misto.

1645
02:06:34,430 --> 02:06:35,370
Always go to Misto.

1646
02:06:35,550 --> 02:06:36,130
Get the pondering.

1647
02:06:38,410 --> 02:06:40,110
I don't remember what's here.

1648
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:46,760
This is not where they're building the other APA.

1649
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:48,160
That's more down there.

1650
02:06:48,260 --> 02:06:49,920
So I don't remember what's here.

1651
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,000
To be honest.

1652
02:06:54,580 --> 02:06:55,660
I don't remember.

1653
02:06:57,420 --> 02:06:57,980
Um.

1654
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,900
Another Namtara.

1655
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:05,860
You have a pachinko parlor here.

1656
02:07:06,540 --> 02:07:08,620
And then Don Quixote, as I mentioned before.

1657
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:12,020
Hold on, let's go down a little bit.

1658
02:07:12,380 --> 02:07:13,120
Meow, meow.

1659
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:19,160
So this Don Quixote is open 24-7.

1660
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:25,640
It has arcade, sixth and seventh floor.

1661
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:27,980
What?

1662
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:38,880
floor is is it the fifth floor the fourth or the fourth or
fifth floor has the at home but there also is the akb48 um

1663
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:49,540

makeup, you can get skincare, you can get costumes, you can

1665
02:08:02,900 --> 02:08:03,640
get...

1666
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:08,540
This particular Don Quixote has a really cute Sanrio section
that I like to go check out.

1667
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:10,260
This is Japanese Walmart.

1668
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:12,340
Basically.

1669
02:08:14,040 --> 02:08:18,160
Yeah, I didn't want to say it, but yeah, basically.

1670
02:08:19,960 --> 02:08:22,460
But it's also this Don Quixote in particular.

1671
02:08:23,060 --> 02:08:27,200
I mean, any Don Quixote that you go to in like a major city,
Shibuya.

1672
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:38,080
Shinjuku, Akihabara, you know like the big the big like
tourist hot spots the Don Quixote's are going to be So

1673
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:45,240
crowded and again Japan loves to pack so much in a tiny
space So the aisles are very small.

1674
02:08:45,580 --> 02:08:46,740
There's tons of people.

1675
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:58,380
It is very very very very gem packed in there So just be
aware about that, but at the bottom here they have Sorry,

1676
02:08:58,500 --> 02:08:59,500
they have a crape place.

1677
02:08:59,820 --> 02:09:01,400
They have a takoyaki place.

1678
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:03,980
I don't remember what the other one is.

1679
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:08,360
It's a great gift spot, though.

1680
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:09,640
It is, yes.

1681
02:09:09,860 --> 02:09:11,640
You can get so much at Don Quixote.

1682
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:13,000
It's crazy.

1683
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:14,540
Yeah, yeah.

1684
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:19,600
And yeah, they have a great place to get pen lights.

1685
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:20,180
You can!

1686
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:21,840
You can get pen lights here.

1687
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:23,480
They have lots of...

1688
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:25,040
You can get Yu-Os here.

1689
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:27,940
Don't get me wrong.

1690
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,160
I love Don Quixote.

1691
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:30,960
I love Don Quixote so much.

1692
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:34,940
I buy stuff from there all the time.

1693
02:09:36,900 --> 02:09:39,380
Oh yeah, there's a Tsukumo.

1694
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:43,180

remember sorry i should like i should do like uh um In the

1705
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:31,380
past, I've made videos of me just walking through Akiba.

1706
02:10:31,580 --> 02:10:34,360
Like, not talking, just, like, walking down the street.

1707
02:10:34,740 --> 02:10:36,260
I never posted them anywhere, though.

1708
02:10:36,460 --> 02:10:38,480
I just always kept them for myself.

1709
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:41,800
I mean, I intended on posting them.

1710
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:43,040
I just never did.

1711
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:46,960
Let's see.

1712
02:10:47,320 --> 02:10:48,960
What's some other things that I can think of?

1713
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:50,480
My brain is starting to lose it.

1714
02:10:50,860 --> 02:10:52,260
Mother made dream in here.

1715
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:53,720
There's Surugaya here.

1716
02:10:53,820 --> 02:10:54,580
At least one of them.

1717
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:55,840
There's one Surugaya here.

1718
02:10:55,880 --> 02:10:57,980
There's several in Akihabara as well.

1719
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:06,000
You can't see it, but there's the Akibao here.

1720
02:11:07,540 --> 02:11:10,060
There's a lot of like just small, what's it called?

1721
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:16,300
Like figure shops and electronics stores and stuff as you
can see.

1722
02:11:18,780 --> 02:11:20,160
There's Carl's Jr.

1723
02:11:23,460 --> 02:11:27,980
There's Carl's Jr. Okay, so there's a mocha cat cat.

1724
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:44,580
cafe here I have heard from friends about mocha cat cafe to
maybe don't go even it's a chain but apparently from what my

1725
02:11:44,580 --> 02:11:54,040
friends have told me they had an incident where they knew
that their cats were sick and they just let them continue

1726
02:11:54,040 --> 02:11:54,860
being sick

1727
02:11:58,840 --> 02:12:12,320
so uh i don't know how true that is but i you know but but
it's what my friend said i hope it's not true but i'm it has

1728
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:20,180
made me wary of going to mocha now to this chain and there's
mochas in like there's one in harajuku there's one in

1729
02:12:20,180 --> 02:12:29,260
shinjuku there's there's it's a really popular cat cafe
chain so uh there is a cat cafe though in Akiba that I

1730
02:12:29,260 --> 02:12:29,960
really like.

1731
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:32,760
So I will take you guys to that one.

1732
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:37,380
I've never been to this meat place.

1733
02:12:38,820 --> 02:12:40,240
Maybe Matara would like it.

1734
02:12:40,620 --> 02:12:41,780
Because it's meat and wine.

1735
02:12:43,800 --> 02:12:46,400
There's also some other stuff like...

1736
02:12:46,400 --> 02:12:46,600
Oh wait.

1737
02:12:47,460 --> 02:12:47,940
It's more...

1738
02:12:47,940 --> 02:12:48,100
Wait.

1739
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:49,860
There's also like an idol.

1740
02:12:51,780 --> 02:12:53,880
Is this where the Affiliate Saga is?

1741
02:12:54,260 --> 02:12:55,180
I think so.

1742
02:12:55,780 --> 02:12:57,700
I think this is where the Affiliate is.

1743
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,010
and some other like idle...

1744
02:13:02,740 --> 02:13:03,720
Um...

1745
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:04,340
What's the words?

1746
02:13:04,820 --> 02:13:06,300
Idle Cafes?

1747
02:13:06,540 --> 02:13:06,720
Yeah.

1748
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:08,820
Meat wine.

1749
02:13:10,480 --> 02:13:13,920
Idle Carl's Jr. Exactly, exactly.

1750
02:13:14,700 --> 02:13:23,200
If you need the most inexpensive family restaurant in the
entire world, Caesarea is your man.

1751
02:13:23,860 --> 02:13:27,720
Caesarea is an Italian family restaurant.

1752
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:33,140
And it is the most inexpensive restaurant you can probably
ever go to ever.

1753
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:34,360
It is so...

1754
02:13:35,540 --> 02:13:38,540
It is so cheap.

1755
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:41,640
It's actually so cheap.

1756
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:50,880
If you want, like, if you were just, like, going to Japan on
a budget, Saizaria is vaguely Italian is the best way to put

1757
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:51,100
it.

1758
02:13:51,580 --> 02:13:53,300
Yes, vaguely Italian.

1759
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:57,980
Oh, um, remember how I mentioned the Nikumansi is...

1760
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,520
opened up a new shop.

1761
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:00,340
It's in here.

1762
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,120
It's in here, so I haven't checked it out yet.

1763
02:14:05,500 --> 02:14:06,680
I will go next time.

1764
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:07,780
I'm in Japan.

1765
02:14:09,560 --> 02:14:11,000
Olive Garden, too.

1766
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:18,320
But seriously, the only thing is, is because it's so
inexpensive and they're open late, it's very crowded.

1767
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:19,860
There's usually, like, a line.

1768
02:14:20,440 --> 02:14:22,560
So, especially if there's an event.

1769
02:14:24,440 --> 02:14:25,640
I like get you.

1770
02:14:27,020 --> 02:14:37,640
This is a This is an Edo Gay store that I somewhat frequent,
so if I'm brave enough, sometimes I'm a little shy and I

1771
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:38,380
don't go in.

1772
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:52,750
But, so if you're looking for Edo Gay, I like to go there.

1773
02:14:58,010 --> 02:15:06,050
anyways we're just gonna gloss over that oh there's see
another akiba oh another akiba oh you can see it better here

1774
02:15:06,050 --> 02:15:17,770
yeah well then no that's main dream in where maybe it's in
here or oh no just kidding that's a dentist

1775
02:15:21,230 --> 02:15:30,830
there's another surugaya there's just so much um let's keep
going you know what let's just keep going down the main road

1776
02:15:30,830 --> 02:15:40,470
until we get to until we get to the end of like the main
main main stuff and uh then i'll take you down some of the

1777
02:15:40,470 --> 02:15:47,810
back roads that we didn't go down before or that i like
avoided not avoided but you know what i mean um if you're a

1778
02:15:47,810 --> 02:15:54,090
royal host is another chain um family restaurant it's more
Food is actually so good.

1779
02:15:55,850 --> 02:15:56,690
It's actually so good.

1780
02:15:56,990 --> 02:15:59,950
If I ever go to Japan, I'm probably coming out with like
$200 of Eroge.

1781
02:16:00,370 --> 02:16:04,070
The great thing, too, is that you can find so much cheap
Eroge.

1782
02:16:05,990 --> 02:16:09,350
So $200 would be like a ton of stuff.

1783
02:16:10,930 --> 02:16:12,170
It would be so great.

1784
02:16:13,810 --> 02:16:14,990
Obsessed with Royal Hosts.

1785
02:16:15,030 --> 02:16:18,290
Yeah, there's also this Tendon place, which is pretty good.

1786
02:16:18,630 --> 02:16:19,050
Oh, wait.

1787
02:16:22,190 --> 02:16:22,730
The...

1788
02:16:22,750 --> 02:16:24,830
The pepper lunch is down here.

1789
02:16:26,130 --> 02:16:27,390
I'll take you there, obviously.

1790
02:16:28,850 --> 02:16:31,110
This is, I'm pretty sure, going to be the Apa.

1791
02:16:33,410 --> 02:16:34,270
Does it say?

1792
02:16:34,770 --> 02:16:35,830
It doesn't say yet.

1793
02:16:35,970 --> 02:16:39,210
But I'm almost positive this is going to be a new Apa hotel.

1794
02:16:42,110 --> 02:16:43,210
Which is like...

1795
02:16:43,210 --> 02:16:46,350
That makes it like 5 in Aki, but it's kind of crazy.

1796
02:16:47,070 --> 02:16:47,990
Aka is a guy!

1797
02:16:48,510 --> 02:16:49,510
Thank you for the vibe gifted.

1798
02:16:49,690 --> 02:16:50,210
Thank you.

1799
02:16:51,290 --> 02:16:51,890
Thank you.

1800
02:16:52,750 --> 02:16:53,390
No, right?

1801
02:16:53,630 --> 02:16:54,470
Another one.

1802
02:16:54,590 --> 02:16:55,350
It's kind of crazy.

1803
02:16:56,210 --> 02:16:57,870
I like this ramen here.

1804
02:16:58,570 --> 02:17:00,390
The Tonkotsa ramen here is pretty good.

1805
02:17:00,770 --> 02:17:02,110
I think this is also a chain, though.

1806
02:17:02,490 --> 02:17:04,650
So it's not just Akiba, but I like their stuff.

1807
02:17:05,010 --> 02:17:08,050
There's some more maid cafes in here.

1808
02:17:08,190 --> 02:17:13,830
I'm pretty sure this is also where the Lillian Plyan moved
to, which I like them.

1809
02:17:14,410 --> 02:17:15,910
They have two locations.

1810
02:17:16,550 --> 02:17:17,150
Is it here?

1811
02:17:18,670 --> 02:17:19,390
It might be.

1812
02:17:19,430 --> 02:17:20,590
I think they did move in here.

1813
02:17:21,710 --> 02:17:30,830
Um, uh, they're like a, they're like a cute fairy themed,
um, made cafe, very cute.

1814
02:17:31,550 --> 02:17:38,090
Uh, there's like a cool figure store here.

1815
02:17:38,790 --> 02:17:39,450
Let's see.

1816
02:17:39,830 --> 02:17:40,150
Miam.

1817
02:17:42,510 --> 02:17:43,090
Chambara!

1818
02:17:43,710 --> 02:17:45,510
More electronic stuff here.

1819
02:17:47,310 --> 02:17:48,190
Fairy themed?

1820
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:48,730
Yeah!

1821
02:17:49,730 --> 02:17:50,570
Yeah!

1822
02:17:50,590 --> 02:17:59,690
I call this place maid cafe building because it's all maid
cafes except yaki niku like at the very bottom uh heart of

1823
02:17:59,690 --> 02:18:05,770
hearts used to be up here but actually now it's in um that
location where I showed with the witch's garden it actually

1824
02:18:05,770 --> 02:18:13,730
reopened after a little bit of what seems to be kind of
drama um but there's several maid cafes in here to get into

1825
02:18:13,730 --> 02:18:29,310
this to the into the maid cafes though you have to go down
here and you go down here and you enter oh you enter oh you

1826
02:18:29,310 --> 02:18:38,250
enter here so if you see if you're just like mind escape
that sounds like a cool cafe to go to you can't get into it

1827
02:18:38,250 --> 02:18:48,890
on the other way it looks shady yeah a little bit but that's
just how it is that's just how it is baby los tempos thank

1828
02:18:48,890 --> 02:18:59,190
you for yeah there's some maid cafes in here as well but I
have not been oh my gosh please please it's just enough

1829
02:18:59,190 --> 02:19:06,130
every time I have not been to these ones because not gonna
lie kind of look a little shady as well so

1830
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:24,030
let's see it's a royal house oh whoa whoa whoa okay let's go
back to the main road we're in June 2021 no let's do July

1831
02:19:24,030 --> 02:19:32,990
2022 as recent as we can get king and queen was a good stop
for a drink I've never been this it used to be a place

1832
02:19:32,990 --> 02:19:46,290
called the alley which which what's the word what had bubble
tea or was it the alley I think so but they had bubble tea

1833
02:19:46,290 --> 02:19:48,570
which I really I would go there a couple times

1834
02:19:51,890 --> 02:19:52,850
Let's see,

1835
02:19:56,010 --> 02:20:00,230
so one of my favorite places to eat in Akiba is actually
right here.

1836
02:20:00,470 --> 02:20:01,530
This most burger.

1837
02:20:02,470 --> 02:20:04,710
Kind of similar to Fuomoko.

1838
02:20:05,450 --> 02:20:10,530
It has it like, you know, with the Mr. Donuts, how they like
to just eat up top with their ponder ring.

1839
02:20:10,790 --> 02:20:18,290
I like to come here and I like to get the Yakiniku rice bun
burger and I sit up here and I just kind of like to look at

1840
02:20:18,290 --> 02:20:19,050
Akiba.

1841
02:20:20,590 --> 02:20:31,190
maybe isn't as nice as the Mr. Donuts, but it's still
something that I do basically every time I'm in Akiva as I

1842
02:20:31,190 --> 02:20:34,830
go here and I sit at the, I sit at the, oh, hi people.

1843
02:20:35,810 --> 02:20:43,310
I sit at the little table and I like to eat the rice bun
burger because it's the best thing.

1844
02:20:43,530 --> 02:20:47,130
I never order anything else at Moss Burger except the rice
bun burger.

1845
02:20:47,510 --> 02:20:48,670
It's most delicious ever.

1846
02:20:53,570 --> 02:21:05,790
so it's so awesome i love i like that spot a lot um a little
more down it becomes like a little bit less you get some

1847
02:21:05,790 --> 02:21:15,770
gotcha stores and stuff oh right here is like a big um it
says it has like the miku racing right now um it's for a

1848
02:21:15,770 --> 02:21:21,850
while it's been like kind of a good smile store not good But
is it Good Smile?

1849
02:21:22,270 --> 02:21:25,870
It has, it has like Racing Miku and they have like some
other figures.

1850
02:21:26,850 --> 02:21:27,930
And, um.

1851
02:21:29,270 --> 02:21:29,790
Uh.

1852
02:21:30,950 --> 02:21:32,110
That's Good Smile HQ?

1853
02:21:33,150 --> 02:21:33,910
No way!

1854
02:21:34,390 --> 02:21:34,750
What?

1855
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:45,580
But it's still here.

1856
02:21:45,780 --> 02:21:46,600
It's still here.

1857
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:52,540
It's, um, it's just like they have the, it's the, this looks
like it's just a Racing Miku like pop-up.

1858
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:55,360
But they do still have Racing Miku stuff inside.

1859
02:21:55,480 --> 02:21:56,960
They just have other figures as well.

1860
02:21:57,340 --> 02:22:05,500
um like they have like some pop-up parade things and they
have uh just a this just like some general figure stuff

1861
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:17,040
there used to be a scam postcard store right around here
what this one this one with the lady that always tries to

1862
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:24,160
get you to go in uh this chat time is not here anymore which
makes me so sad it was a bubble tea place

1863
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:32,040
It's funny because in the game Akiba's trip you like fight
these ladies.

1864
02:22:34,100 --> 02:22:39,040
You fight these ladies because they're always so pushy about
getting you to buy the art.

1865
02:22:41,100 --> 02:22:41,960
So annoying.

1866
02:22:43,740 --> 02:22:45,380
Down here is another...

1867
02:22:45,380 --> 02:22:46,220
Oh, wait, what?

1868
02:22:46,520 --> 02:22:47,280
Okay, 2019.

1869
02:22:47,560 --> 02:22:49,080
I was going to say this is...

1870
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:52,520
I think it's this building or this building.

1871
02:22:53,080 --> 02:22:57,320
One of these buildings is another made...

1872
02:22:57,340 --> 02:22:58,620
Oh, made cafe building.

1873
02:22:58,740 --> 02:22:59,380
Okay, let's see.

1874
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:01,000
This one.

1875
02:23:01,220 --> 02:23:02,220
I was close.

1876
02:23:03,260 --> 02:23:06,120
This is another, like, very made cafe.

1877
02:23:06,280 --> 02:23:08,160
There's a bunch of different themes here.

1878
02:23:08,700 --> 02:23:09,740
One of them is a V-Tuber.

1879
02:23:09,980 --> 02:23:10,840
I think it's this one.

1880
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:13,080
It's the V-Tuber themed cafe.

1881
02:23:13,660 --> 02:23:16,140
I still haven't gone because I'm very...

1882
02:23:16,140 --> 02:23:20,960
Someone once said that it was weird when they went.

1883
02:23:21,460 --> 02:23:23,540
So I'm still deciding.

1884
02:23:23,900 --> 02:23:24,940
Is that Picardine?

1885
02:23:26,940 --> 02:23:32,800
that might be Picardy but yeah there's lots of made cafes
and themed cafes I mean this one's a cheerleading themed one

1886
02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:44,940
not necessarily a made cafe how weird I don't know I'm gonna
go next time I'm gonna go next time I'm gonna get over my

1887
02:23:44,940 --> 02:23:56,160
fears of the weird cafe I won't tell them I'm a YouTuber oh
yeah see you can kind of see it's closed off but it is it is

1892
02:24:28,300 --> 02:24:32,720
If you're into Hello Project, there's the big Hello Project
store here.

1893
02:24:33,060 --> 02:24:35,460
There's also some other hobby stores up in here.

1894
02:24:36,700 --> 02:24:37,680
An army store.

1895
02:24:37,960 --> 02:24:41,000
This hobby shop that has a bunch of military stuff.

Akihabara.

1982
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:37,900
Um, actually, I walked this way because I walked this way.

02:33:49,080 --> 02:33:49,980
Oh, I found it.

02:33:50,180 --> 02:33:50,800

1995
02:33:51,540 --> 02:33:52,140
I found it.

1996
02:33:55,840 --> 02:33:56,460
I found it.

1997
02:34:00,200 --> 02:34:01,980
Let me pull it up.

1998
02:34:05,300 --> 02:34:05,900
Wait.

1999
02:34:08,140 --> 02:34:08,740
Wait.

2000
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:09,820
One second.

2001
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:11,120
Sorry.

2002
02:34:13,300 --> 02:34:13,400
Um.

2003
02:34:16,550 --> 02:34:17,270
One second.

2004
02:34:17,550 --> 02:34:22,690
Oh, I didn't want it to accidentally open the pictures in
the wrong browser, which is why I hit it.

2005
02:34:23,770 --> 02:34:24,150
Sorry.

2006
02:34:24,430 --> 02:34:24,970
One second.

2007
02:34:27,050 --> 02:34:29,230
Uh, and also let me check for reflection.

2008
02:34:34,330 --> 02:34:34,750
So.

2009
02:34:36,950 --> 02:34:38,770
You're walking down the street.

2010
02:34:42,350 --> 02:34:44,130
And you see him.

2011
02:34:44,270 --> 02:34:44,630
Oh.

2012
02:34:50,300 --> 02:34:52,440
It's dark and you lost your way.

2013
02:34:53,400 --> 02:34:55,240
You don't know where you're going.

2014
02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:59,860
But you hear a rustle behind in a dark alleyway.

2015
02:35:01,340 --> 02:35:02,840
You turn confused.

2016
02:35:03,740 --> 02:35:05,440
And who else could it be?

2017
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:07,160
Actual cannibal.

2018
02:35:07,960 --> 02:35:09,120
Olaf from Frozen.

2019
02:35:11,820 --> 02:35:15,750
Do you see it now?

2020
02:35:24,520 --> 02:35:28,260
Do you see it now with the reflection and then the picture?

2021
02:35:31,420 --> 02:35:34,860
This is what I saw walking home at night.

2022
02:35:35,500 --> 02:35:37,800
It scared the actual crap out of me.

2023
02:35:38,200 --> 02:35:39,580
I was like, oh my god!

2024
02:35:41,420 --> 02:35:43,240
I don't know why he's there.

2025
02:35:44,760 --> 02:35:48,920
Actual cannibal, Olaf from Frozen, is real.

2026
02:35:51,540 --> 02:35:53,980
And he exists in this building.

2027
02:35:55,220 --> 02:35:57,760
Yoro Zuya 7 BIRU.

2028
02:35:59,240 --> 02:36:01,360
Across from Asan Cafe.

2029
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
And clearly, this is from July 22.

2030
02:36:05,720 --> 02:36:06,020
2022.

2031
02:36:07,460 --> 02:36:08,220
so, so,

2032
02:36:12,440 --> 02:36:15,580
so, whoa, my phone just fell, sorry.

2033
02:36:16,340 --> 02:36:18,540
Um, so he's been there for several years now.

2034
02:36:20,140 --> 02:36:25,460
Um, so, So you can probably go to this place and visit scary
Olaf.

2035
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:28,120
Again, he's across from Cafe Asan.

2036
02:36:28,960 --> 02:36:29,900
This is a real mystery.

2037
02:36:30,060 --> 02:36:31,680
Have you ever seen this?

2038
02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:32,120
Bajamin.

2039
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:33,620
I know Olaf.

2040
02:36:36,140 --> 02:36:36,420
Why?

2041
02:36:36,640 --> 02:36:37,020
Why?

2042
02:36:37,360 --> 02:36:37,500
Why?

2043
02:36:37,980 --> 02:36:38,580
Why?

2044
02:36:39,060 --> 02:36:39,740
Why?

2045
02:36:39,740 --> 02:36:40,340
Why?

2046
02:36:40,340 --> 02:36:40,740
Why?

2047
02:36:40,840 --> 02:36:41,020
Why?

2048
02:36:42,780 --> 02:36:43,460
Why?

2049
02:36:48,280 --> 02:36:49,640
Olaf is.

2050
02:36:51,260 --> 02:36:56,800
Anyway, I just wanted to share the Blendream and the
cafe-a-san.

2051
02:36:57,600 --> 02:36:58,880
Wait, how do I get out of here?

2052
02:36:59,860 --> 02:37:00,420
Let me out!

2053
02:37:01,720 --> 02:37:02,380
I have it.

2054
02:37:14,720 --> 02:37:16,820
Last year, since last year.

2055
02:37:22,040 --> 02:37:23,580
This is June.

2056
02:37:24,160 --> 02:37:25,520
And he's holding like a...

2057
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:27,280
He's holding a...

2058
02:37:27,280 --> 02:37:28,340
Oh my gosh, I think...

2059
02:37:28,340 --> 02:37:28,880
Oh, there we go.

2060
02:37:29,180 --> 02:37:31,820
He's holding a candy bucket, like a Halloween bucket.

2061
02:37:32,180 --> 02:37:35,160
So I thought he was like a Halloween...

2062
02:37:35,780 --> 02:37:37,560
Like prop, but no.

2063
02:37:38,360 --> 02:37:39,000
I don't know.

2064
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:41,480
That Olaf is so terrifying.

2065
02:37:41,620 --> 02:37:43,080
It's so scary.

2066
02:37:44,700 --> 02:37:46,260
It's so scary.

2067
02:37:46,920 --> 02:37:48,420
It's so funny to see.

2068
02:37:48,780 --> 02:37:50,920
Oh, I like this hotel here.

2069
02:37:52,300 --> 02:37:53,180
This hotel...

2070
02:37:54,160 --> 02:38:03,720
on oh here you can see the name the dormy in akihabara i
really like because at the top right up here is um is an

2071
02:38:03,720 --> 02:38:17,140
onsen it's an outdoor onsen it's not very big but it's um
dormy and goaded yeah it's really nice so um it's also uh

2072
02:38:17,140 --> 02:38:22,800
the rooms are like kind of more japanese style like they
have the tatami mats and everything like that.

2073
02:38:24,340 --> 02:38:26,620
But, um, Dormian rocks.

2074
02:38:26,860 --> 02:38:27,100
Yeah!

2075
02:38:28,740 --> 02:38:34,960
Um, but, uh, and it's quite affordable.

2076
02:38:35,160 --> 02:38:44,600
It's, I think it still counts as a, um, as a business hotel,
so it's quite affordable, and, um, and you can, you can use

2077
02:38:44,600 --> 02:38:45,460
the onsen for free.

2078
02:38:49,280 --> 02:38:50,680
Do you like the idol masterment?

2079
02:38:50,780 --> 02:38:51,440
Yeah, I do.

2080
02:38:52,860 --> 02:38:54,620
Didn't know there was an onsen in Akiba.

2081
02:38:55,140 --> 02:38:57,060
It's like...

2082
02:38:57,060 --> 02:38:59,720
Onsen, maybe in quotes, but it's still really nice.

2083
02:39:01,360 --> 02:39:03,640
I stayed at the Dormy Inn across from Tokyo Dome last month.

2084
02:39:03,760 --> 02:39:04,300
It was amazing.

2085
02:39:04,480 --> 02:39:05,120
Oh, nice.

2086
02:39:05,320 --> 02:39:07,220
Yes, also I should mention, it is a chain.

2087
02:39:07,920 --> 02:39:13,180
So, um, so, uh, it's not like you have to stay only at this
one.

2088
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:18,680
There are Dormy Inns at other places, and I believe they all
have the onsen at the top, so it's pretty nice.

2089
02:39:21,760 --> 02:39:35,520
realize we're back to Chuodori but you might also notice
there is a train station here this is for the metro which um

2090
02:39:35,520 --> 02:39:44,160
you saw there was the metro for Akihabara station oh there's
pepper lunch but the metro for Akihabara station is the

2091
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:51,590
Hibiya line this is actually um we hold on I'm trying to get
the name so you can see it.

2092
02:39:52,760 --> 02:39:53,000
Uh.

2093
02:39:57,440 --> 02:39:58,530
So now, should I say it?

2094
02:40:02,180 --> 02:40:02,790
There we go.

2095
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:07,300
So Sui Hirocho.

2096
02:40:08,520 --> 02:40:21,500
So, if you are coming to Akihabara and you're just like, oh,
my hotel is not is not, it does not go directly to Akiba,

2097
02:40:21,780 --> 02:40:33,400
you could also check to see if it goes to Sui Hirocho
because this will also lead you exactly on Chuo Dori, on the

2098
02:40:33,400 --> 02:40:34,060
main street.

2099
02:40:35,140 --> 02:40:41,440
So it's not like Akiba station proper, but it is still in
the heart of Akihabara.

2100
02:40:41,920 --> 02:40:43,380
And then there's, you know, the exit here.

2101
02:40:44,380 --> 02:40:45,640
Or exit entrance here.

2102
02:40:46,180 --> 02:40:47,360
Exit entrance over there.

2103
02:40:48,540 --> 02:40:49,460
Yes, the Giza line.

2104
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:52,300
You can see, you can see it's the orange one right there.

2105
02:40:53,100 --> 02:40:56,020
There is, there are a couple other train stations you can
take.

2106
02:40:57,280 --> 02:40:57,980
What was one?

2107
02:40:58,540 --> 02:40:59,580
Hold on, let me check.

2108
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:01,180
I can't remember the name.

2109
02:41:02,920 --> 02:41:04,860
Hold on, I'm going to check from maps.

2110
02:41:05,400 --> 02:41:10,920
There's another one that takes you, it's a little bit more
of a walk, but by a walk, I mean like two minutes.

2111
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:11,860
It's not even that long.

2112
02:41:17,140 --> 02:41:22,280
directions to Akihabara

2113
02:41:26,520 --> 02:41:41,980
the other station is wait here we go train station is Ogawa
Machi Ogawa Machi oh there is also Okachi Machi yeah but

2114
02:41:41,980 --> 02:41:52,760
Ogawa Machi takes you takes you it's like I would have to go
kind of far it's kind of all the way it's kind of all the

2115
02:41:52,760 --> 02:42:04,740
way like down there by Akiba Station but it drops you off
like maybe like a three minute walk to to like Pasela area

2116
02:42:06,820 --> 02:42:14,380
so if you're like trying to get to Akihabra I would
definitely look at some stations around as well because Not

2117
02:42:14,380 --> 02:42:21,240
all of them are going to lead to Akihabara station proper,
but you could maybe find, I mean, Google Maps will do that

2118
02:42:21,240 --> 02:42:21,820
for you, right?

2119
02:42:22,240 --> 02:42:28,820
Like, Google Maps will find you the best way to get there,
but, um, you know, you don't have to go to...

2120
02:42:29,340 --> 02:42:29,640
Whoa!

2121
02:42:30,320 --> 02:42:31,380
Where are we here?

2122
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:34,040
You don't have to go to Akihabara station proper.

2123
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:35,940
There's a couple others around, too.

2124
02:42:37,780 --> 02:42:38,900
Wow, Japan has CBD.

2125
02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:39,940
I know, right?

2126
02:42:40,060 --> 02:42:41,580
It's so weird to see now.

2127
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:45,440
It's really weird to see.

2128
02:42:47,080 --> 02:42:48,540
I'm trying to get in here.

2129
02:42:50,680 --> 02:42:53,260
So, if we're going to go down some of the back streets now.

2130
02:42:53,860 --> 02:42:54,420
Back streets.

2131
02:42:54,740 --> 02:42:55,620
There's Culture Zone.

2132
02:42:56,880 --> 02:43:01,620
So, um, Akiva, like, seems huge and small all at the same
time.

2133
02:43:02,660 --> 02:43:05,620
It's so big and small all at the same time.

2134
02:43:06,600 --> 02:43:06,720
Where?

2135
02:43:09,160 --> 02:43:09,640
Um...

2136
02:43:21,770 --> 02:43:22,330
Dolphin.

2137
02:43:23,450 --> 02:43:24,010
Dolphin.

2138
02:43:27,470 --> 02:43:28,870
I can't tell.

2139
02:43:29,970 --> 02:43:31,050
Where am I?

2140
02:43:31,770 --> 02:43:35,430
I know where I am, but like, I'm trying to figure out.

2141
02:43:35,490 --> 02:43:36,070
Okay, hold on.

2142
02:43:36,810 --> 02:43:38,310
Okay, hold on.

2143
02:43:38,410 --> 02:43:39,150
Okay, hold on.

2144
02:43:40,170 --> 02:43:43,110
For some reason, I always...

2145
02:43:44,970 --> 02:43:49,930
If I'm looking this way, it's more confusing than if I'm
looking this way.

2146
02:43:50,470 --> 02:43:51,130
I don't know why.

2147
02:43:53,470 --> 02:43:54,050
Bunny Garden!

2148
02:43:56,150 --> 02:43:56,730
Yes!

2149
02:43:57,150 --> 02:43:57,450
Okay.

02:44:03,210 --> 02:44:03,810
Yes!

2153
02:44:04,210 --> 02:44:05,770
Okay, that's why I kept turning around.

2154
02:44:06,070 --> 02:44:07,690

Wait, I went to March.

2197
02:47:59,690 --> 02:48:00,130
There we go.

2198
02:48:00,250 --> 02:48:03,230
Oh my gosh.

2199
02:48:04,090 --> 02:48:05,210
Oh my gosh.

2200
02:48:06,710 --> 02:48:07,630
Dempa Gumi Inc.

2201
02:48:08,350 --> 02:48:09,230
DSDJ, Yokozo!

2202
02:48:10,030 --> 02:48:11,830
And then this is another Dempa Gumi album.

2203
02:48:12,230 --> 02:48:14,090
And then this is Moso Calibration.

2204
02:48:15,970 --> 02:48:34,590
One Man Live Yeah, oh my gosh Natskashi Natskashi It's
always been the same Thomas Thanks for the 10 gift Thank you

2205
02:48:34,590 --> 02:48:44,330
So I've I've talked about it before But on the first floor
here There's a big stage right here You can go in If the

2206
02:48:44,330 --> 02:48:48,390
curtain, sometimes the curtain is closed, just walk right
past it.

2207
02:48:48,570 --> 02:48:49,990
You can open up the curtain.

2208
02:48:50,310 --> 02:48:53,910
They just do it for like live performances and stuff like
that.

2209
02:48:54,090 --> 02:48:59,810
If there's gonna be a, if there's gonna be a live
performance, you just go on in.

2210
02:49:00,950 --> 02:49:03,010
As long as it's not a ticketed day, of course.

2211
02:49:03,470 --> 02:49:05,530
But they'll stop you, of course, if there's, if it is.

2212
02:49:06,410 --> 02:49:11,990
And then this floor is the cafe, and then this floor is the
bar.

2213
02:49:12,510 --> 02:49:16,270
So the whole building is Deer Stage.

2214
02:49:16,470 --> 02:49:17,230
Are they open every day?

2215
02:49:17,550 --> 02:49:17,890
No.

2216
02:49:20,330 --> 02:49:21,390
No, they're not.

2217
02:49:21,970 --> 02:49:23,550
I don't remember what day they're closed, though.

2218
02:49:25,490 --> 02:49:26,810
How do you get tickets for Deer Stage?

2219
02:49:27,330 --> 02:49:28,190
That's the cool thing.

2220
02:49:28,570 --> 02:49:34,430
Unless it's an event, the tickets might be a little more
hard to get because sometimes they're fan club related and

2221
02:49:34,430 --> 02:49:35,050
things like that.

2222
02:49:35,510 --> 02:49:38,930
But for normal days, you just walk in and you pay.

2223
02:49:39,190 --> 02:49:39,650
And that's it.

2224
02:49:39,790 --> 02:49:40,490
It's super easy.

2225
02:49:41,990 --> 02:49:42,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2226
02:49:43,810 --> 02:49:44,390
I wonder...

2227
02:49:44,390 --> 02:49:44,470
What?

2228
02:49:44,650 --> 02:49:45,290
2009.

2229
02:49:47,030 --> 02:49:54,770
Okay, so it's hard to tell, but this is actually, like, they
lift up.

2230
02:49:55,110 --> 02:49:59,030
Like, they're, they're, they're, it's like a sliding door,
basically.

2231
02:49:59,670 --> 02:50:00,630
Oh, my gosh.

2232
02:50:01,290 --> 02:50:04,590
Oh, my gosh.

2233
02:50:04,670 --> 02:50:05,390
Is that lettuce?

2234
02:50:05,650 --> 02:50:06,190
Oh, my God.

2235
02:50:06,370 --> 02:50:06,950
Stop.

2236
02:50:08,170 --> 02:50:08,870
Oh.

2237
02:50:12,350 --> 02:50:14,310
Are Nora and Petra in this?

2238
02:50:14,490 --> 02:50:15,790
I can't, I don't think so.

2239
02:50:16,350 --> 02:50:17,610
Wait, is Amane in this?

2240
02:50:17,730 --> 02:50:18,390
I can't tell.

2241
02:50:18,690 --> 02:50:21,110
There's, there's meeting up front that looks like...

2242
02:50:21,110 --> 02:50:22,390
Nemo, Ita-so!

2243
02:50:23,590 --> 02:50:24,850
Oh my gosh.

2244
02:50:24,950 --> 02:50:26,430
Sorry, I'm fangirling a little bit.

2245
02:50:28,530 --> 02:50:29,350
This is, oh wait.

2246
02:50:30,030 --> 02:50:34,950
This would be past, this is, would be past Nora, Petra, I'm
pretty sure.

2247
02:50:36,490 --> 02:50:39,550
And then, Moso Calibration again.

2248
02:50:39,870 --> 02:50:40,510
Rest in peace.

2249
02:50:41,990 --> 02:50:54,970
lift up actually so you can actually see here oh my gosh wow
oh my gosh they don't lift it anymore obviously but wow oh

2250
02:50:54,970 --> 02:51:06,990
my god old old dear stage old akihabara but it also also
still kind of looks the same doesn't it let's see from 2009

2251
02:51:06,990 --> 02:51:21,090
to 2022 This is just a computer store instead of what was
also a computer store.

2252
02:51:25,680 --> 02:51:29,540
So, not so much has changed.

2253
02:51:33,400 --> 02:51:35,140
Gotten a little wider.

2254
02:51:35,880 --> 02:51:37,800
It's a blue computer store instead of red.

2255
02:51:38,740 --> 02:51:39,540
Yeah.

2256
02:51:41,520 --> 02:51:49,180
So, you know, it is kind of, it is a little comforting,
right, because, you know, so much of Akiba has changed, but

2257
02:51:49,180 --> 02:51:52,800
it is really comforting to know that also so much has stayed
the same.

2258
02:51:52,800 --> 02:52:03,260
This is Akiba, or Akiba, this is Dear Stages official
vocaloid even too, To ne Leon who is drawn by Poyoyon, one

2259
02:52:03,260 --> 02:52:09,760
of my favorite artists ever, who also known as Akio
Watanabe, also known as the Bakemonogatari artist, who is

2260
02:52:09,760 --> 02:52:13,400
also voiced by my kami-oshi Yumumi Nebu!

2261
02:52:22,920 --> 02:52:27,660
Yes, he also did the art for Kersaya, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2262
02:52:29,200 --> 02:52:39,060
isn't Nemu also a vocaloid you are right she is also her own
vocaloid that she also goes by you memme Nemu she's very

2263
02:52:39,060 --> 02:52:48,960
cute yeah and they built this family mart a couple years ago
so if you are ever at deer stage and you're just like I'm

2264
02:52:48,960 --> 02:52:56,160
just here for the live performances I don't really want to
go to the cafe which you should go to the cafe but it's only

2265
02:52:56,160 --> 02:53:03,780
a thousand yen to see the shows and you get three a night
usually um but if you're like i'm gonna go eat you can leave

2266
02:53:03,780 --> 02:53:07,040
and then go to family mart and then go back

2267
02:53:14,740 --> 02:53:26,900
yeah um what else there's so much i'm gonna probably rush a
little bit more through some of these because I I was dying

2268
02:53:26,900 --> 02:53:39,280
to get so sleepy oh whoa yeah this is all built here but I
don't remember what it is oh this ramen place is good I'm

2269
02:53:39,280 --> 02:53:47,040
almost positive I mentioned it before in my previous ones
but this is a this is a chicken ramen so their broth is

2270
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:56,680
chicken based so some people can't have pork right so if
you're ever like I want chicken ramen um or i can't have

2271
02:53:56,680 --> 02:54:06,580
pork then this place has really really good chicken broth
ramen but also if you're just like oh i'm vegetarian i can't

2272
02:54:06,580 --> 02:54:18,840
have chicken broth either well they also have a vegetarian
ramen so um so uh you can also get full vegetarian ramen at

2273
02:54:18,840 --> 02:54:22,160
this chicken noodle location.

2274
02:54:24,720 --> 02:54:26,060
It's good though.

2275
02:54:27,220 --> 02:54:28,980
Yeah, it's good, it's good, it's good.

2276
02:54:29,380 --> 02:54:29,720
It's good.

2277
02:54:29,900 --> 02:54:36,460
Oh yeah, here my friends and I lovingly call this the deer
stage APA because it's right next to deer stage.

2278
02:54:37,500 --> 02:54:42,140
We're just like, go to deer stage, go to APA, go back home.

2279
02:54:44,280 --> 02:54:47,500
So there's one of the other APAs in Akihabara.

2280
02:54:48,220 --> 02:54:50,380
Oh my gosh, I feel like There's another Akibao.

2281
02:54:50,780 --> 02:54:52,380
I feel like I'm going to have to do another part.

2282
02:54:53,120 --> 02:54:54,120
I feel like I'm...

2283
02:54:54,120 --> 02:54:55,020
I'm...

2284
02:54:56,360 --> 02:54:57,080

2285
02:54:57,080 --> 02:55:00,400
Living the life.

2286
02:55:01,280 --> 02:55:02,400
For those...

2287
02:55:02,400 --> 02:55:03,740
Some people mentioned it before.

2288
02:55:04,840 --> 02:55:06,340
Here is your Mandarake.

2289
02:55:07,480 --> 02:55:08,980
This entire building.

2290
02:55:09,480 --> 02:55:13,660
You do the selling stuff here at the bottom.

2291
02:55:14,200 --> 02:55:18,040
And then every floor above is this whole building is
Mandarake.

2292
02:55:19,780 --> 02:55:21,660
Um, not a mandrake.

2293
02:55:22,280 --> 02:55:23,680
I mean, yes, mandrake.

2294
02:55:24,740 --> 02:55:26,160
A part two would be cool.

2295
02:55:27,240 --> 02:55:30,860
Maybe if I do a part two, I can do some actual footage that
I take.

2296
02:55:31,560 --> 02:55:33,880
I will do my best.

2297
02:55:34,520 --> 02:55:35,600
I will do my best.

2298
02:55:37,080 --> 02:55:39,420
What's your favorite place in the downtown?

2299
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:41,880
The downtown?

2300
02:55:44,900 --> 02:55:45,500
Downtown.

2301
02:55:46,900 --> 02:55:48,980
When you're slow and you want to.

2302
02:55:49,000 --> 02:56:06,660
go you know you can go downtown i like to go to the parlor
show at the deer stage downtown yeah food recommendations

2303
02:56:06,660 --> 02:56:14,880
too i would actually not gonna lie bashamine has been in the
chat bashamine has so many great akihabara food

2304
02:56:14,880 --> 02:56:25,160
recommendations so definitely check out her for her video,
her tours of Akiba as well.

2305
02:56:25,880 --> 02:56:32,820
And I think for me, I probably give more of a perspective
from a, you know, like a tourist.

2306
02:56:34,040 --> 02:56:39,420
So, but she has some really great food recommendations.

2307
02:56:40,140 --> 02:56:42,560
So, I'm pitching her.

2308
02:56:44,320 --> 02:56:44,900
Yeah, yeah.

2309
02:56:45,780 --> 02:56:48,540
She and I have collabed a long time ago in the past.

2310
02:56:50,100 --> 02:56:51,740
She's always been so cute.

2311
02:56:52,020 --> 02:56:52,560
Bashamine!

2312
02:56:53,260 --> 02:56:54,080
Everybody go follow.

2313
02:56:56,080 --> 02:56:57,940
But yeah, here's Mandarake.

2314
02:56:58,420 --> 02:57:00,680
Again, you take the stairs.

2315
02:57:00,820 --> 02:57:03,000
There's also like a teeny tiny elevator here.

2316
02:57:03,340 --> 02:57:05,840
If you don't want to take the stairs like up eight floors.

2317
02:57:06,740 --> 02:57:10,000
But the inside is also very tiny and packed.

2318
02:57:10,240 --> 02:57:11,540
So just be mindful.

2319
02:57:12,300 --> 02:57:16,460
There's a ramen place here, which has really huge ramen.

2320
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,480
anime shows as well.

2321
02:57:23,660 --> 02:57:25,500
Let's see.

2322
02:57:28,940 --> 02:57:31,840
Hard off here as well.

2323
02:57:33,180 --> 02:57:43,280
I remember this spot very vividly because I was standing
like maybe maybe right here or right here.

2324
02:57:43,440 --> 02:57:44,280
Also, I love this.

2325
02:57:47,900 --> 02:57:58,540
I love how they're just like Hey check out what maids we've
got For at home Maid Cafe That's so funny

2326
02:58:04,440 --> 02:58:15,880
Yeah Oh thank you Ghostor Thank you Thank you Thank you But
I was standing right here.

2327
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:23,640
I remember this spot so vividly because I was waiting on a
friend and this guy came up.

2328
02:58:23,800 --> 02:58:25,560
And he tried talking to me in English.

2329
02:58:25,800 --> 02:58:28,200
He was just like, are you lost?

2330
02:58:28,800 --> 02:58:30,320
You look so lost.

2331
02:58:30,620 --> 02:58:33,100
I was just standing here on my phone, like waiting for my
friend.

2332
02:58:33,220 --> 02:58:34,980
I was like, no, I'm not lost.

2333
02:58:35,200 --> 02:58:36,300
I'm waiting for a friend.

2334
02:58:36,780 --> 02:58:37,880
They'll be here soon.

2335
02:58:38,280 --> 02:58:41,160
And he was just like, no, you are lost.

2336
02:58:41,260 --> 02:58:42,660
You are looking at your phone.

2337
02:58:42,960 --> 02:58:44,160
You don't know where to go.

2338
02:58:44,280 --> 02:58:52,320
I was like, no, no, no, no, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just
waiting, I'm just waiting for my friend, they'll be here,

2339
02:58:52,380 --> 02:58:58,240
and they're like, I don't believe you, I don't believe that
you're waiting for your friend, here, here, here, come with

2340
02:58:58,240 --> 02:59:08,640
me, come with me, and I'm like, they tried, like, they tried
kidnapping me, and I had to be like, I'm waiting, for my

2341
02:59:08,640 --> 02:59:09,060
friend!

2342
02:59:14,360 --> 02:59:23,500
I had to be so insistent and then I had to be like oh like I
had to be like my friend is my friend is down here so I just

2343
02:59:23,500 --> 02:59:33,360
I just walked I just it was so weird it was such a weird
experience I was like why are you why would you think I'm

2344
02:59:33,360 --> 02:59:43,060
lost looking at my phone but then again I've also seen some
people in Akiba some foreigners looking at their phones and

2345
02:59:43,060 --> 02:59:47,440
I'm like they cloths.

2346
02:59:47,660 --> 02:59:49,540
So, maybe...

2347
02:59:49,540 --> 02:59:51,820
Maybe I just had a silly look about me.

2348
02:59:53,100 --> 02:59:54,520
Here is Sudugaya.

2349
02:59:54,720 --> 02:59:57,340
Another Sudugaya if you're looking for...

2350
02:59:57,340 --> 02:59:58,200
Oh, Kandu.

2351
02:59:58,300 --> 02:59:59,120
Is it still here?

2352
03:00:00,500 --> 03:00:01,280
This Kandu.

2353
03:00:01,840 --> 03:00:03,840
It's another hundred yen store.

2354
03:00:04,120 --> 03:00:05,400
But I prefer three coin.

2355
03:00:05,660 --> 03:00:06,900
Oh, here's the other side of the Apla.

2356
03:00:08,500 --> 03:00:10,840
You are lost is crazy work.

2357
03:00:11,600 --> 03:00:12,000
Right?

2358
03:00:14,280 --> 03:00:15,840
It's so funny.

2359
03:00:17,020 --> 03:00:19,120
Yeah, there's so many, like, look at this.

2360
03:00:19,780 --> 03:00:21,080
Look at how, look at this.

2361
03:00:22,880 --> 03:00:28,380
I'll be honest, I buy all my stuff from Sudugaya Online.

2362
03:00:29,300 --> 03:00:30,980
This sounded like I just said Gaia Online.

2363
03:00:31,300 --> 03:00:32,920
Sudugaya Online.

2364
03:00:33,320 --> 03:00:39,840
So I don't really visit the stores that much themselves, but
yeah.

2365
03:00:41,500 --> 03:00:42,400
Let's wait.

2366
03:00:44,440 --> 03:00:46,440
I was like, is this the kindergarten?

2367
03:00:47,500 --> 03:00:50,120
So there's like a random park and kindergarten here.

2368
03:00:50,340 --> 03:00:51,140
It's pretty funny.

2369
03:00:51,620 --> 03:00:53,160
I'm trying to look for another place.

2370
03:00:53,320 --> 03:00:54,580
It's not bee cat, though.

2371
03:00:55,980 --> 03:01:02,320
Trying to look for the other Annie Song bar that my friend
suggested.

2372
03:01:02,620 --> 03:01:02,920
Yeah.

2373
03:01:03,960 --> 03:01:05,760
Yeah, here's a kindergarten.

2374
03:01:06,400 --> 03:01:08,900
It's kind of cute because around 5 p.m.

2375
03:01:09,140 --> 03:01:10,300
It is 5 p.m., right?

2376
03:01:10,320 --> 03:01:12,380
At 5 p.m., the chimes will go off.

2377
03:01:15,020 --> 03:01:15,740
So, um...

2378
03:01:15,740 --> 03:01:17,440
You can, uh...

2379
03:01:17,440 --> 03:01:18,260
You'll hear that.

2380
03:01:18,940 --> 03:01:19,420
Okay, hold on.

2381
03:01:19,540 --> 03:01:20,100
I want to go back.

2382
03:01:20,380 --> 03:01:20,980
Not quite done.

2383
03:01:21,760 --> 03:01:22,480
Not quite done.

2384
03:01:22,700 --> 03:01:23,300
Hold on.

2385
03:01:26,940 --> 03:01:32,840
I asked my Normie friends to pick up an animator book from
Mandarake while they were in Akiba, and they were led to the

2386
03:01:32,840 --> 03:01:34,160
floor with all the dojans.

2387
03:01:36,800 --> 03:01:39,300
I mean, there are a lot of floors with dojans.

2388
03:01:41,140 --> 03:01:48,800
um this is i mentioned it earlier uh lily and pleon this is
the other location um i think it's this floor and this floor

2389
03:01:48,800 --> 03:01:57,820

2390
03:01:57,820 --> 03:02:11,480

restaurant in here pizza i'm pretty sure Okay, go back down

2391
03:02:11,480 --> 03:02:11,720

2392
03:02:12,620 --> 03:02:12,860
Oh, wait.

2393
03:02:17,760 --> 03:02:18,240
Mades!

2394
03:02:25,090 --> 03:02:25,570
Spotted.

2395
03:02:26,010 --> 03:02:26,950
Look how cute they are.

2396
03:02:30,570 --> 03:02:33,370
Also, in Akiba, please don't take pictures of the maids.

2397
03:02:33,890 --> 03:02:37,250
Some of them wear signs that, like, say don't take pictures.

2398
03:02:38,890 --> 03:02:40,470
But you're not supposed to.

2399
03:02:41,450 --> 03:02:42,290
Be respectful.

2400
03:02:42,470 --> 03:02:44,190
Don't be those tourists, you know.

2401
03:02:44,890 --> 03:02:46,450
Because now...

2402
03:02:46,450 --> 03:02:46,990
I don't know.

2403
03:02:47,010 --> 03:02:48,550
I'm so worried about some places.

2404
03:02:49,030 --> 03:02:49,610
Because...

2405
03:02:49,610 --> 03:02:56,770
Like you heard about how like tourists are banned from
certain places in Kyoto now.

2406
03:02:59,890 --> 03:03:04,750
Because of how they're chasing after the Michael and
everything.

2407
03:03:05,270 --> 03:03:05,770
The geisha.

2408
03:03:06,070 --> 03:03:06,430
Yeah.

2409
03:03:07,290 --> 03:03:08,270
Yeah and Gion.

2410
03:03:10,490 --> 03:03:23,530
it's kind of crazy the that the geisha chasers and guion
yeah they're banned from like certain streets so just be

2411
03:03:23,530 --> 03:03:33,110
respectful you know there's there's what it's like one thing
to be like yeah I'm I'm having I'm you know I'm a foreigner

2412
03:03:33,110 --> 03:03:38,270
I don't really know what I'm doing I'm having fun I'm trying
to be respectful you know and there's just just being like,

2413
03:03:38,350 --> 03:03:40,030
you know, rowdy rude, you know.

2414
03:03:41,450 --> 03:03:41,790
So.

2415
03:03:43,610 --> 03:03:44,650
Down here.

2416
03:03:45,810 --> 03:03:51,590
I like this poster because Idol Content Expo is drawn by an
idol I really like.

2417
03:03:51,750 --> 03:03:52,890
She's in Debba Gumi Inc.

2418
03:03:52,950 --> 03:03:54,190
Her name is Perorin.

2419
03:03:55,150 --> 03:03:56,190
And she drew this.

2420
03:03:56,290 --> 03:03:57,030
She's so cute.

2421
03:03:59,370 --> 03:03:59,890
Okay.

2422
03:04:00,290 --> 03:04:04,830
I think the last time I did my Akiba tour, we were like,
Akiba CIA, baby.

2423
03:04:05,310 --> 03:04:07,110
We're going to go to Spy Bar.

2424
03:04:07,130 --> 03:04:21,950
akiba cia i regret to inform you that akiba cia is no longer
in fact well i was gonna say i think it's been replaced by a

2425
03:04:21,950 --> 03:04:30,950
dog thing but the dog thing is right here but yeah actually
it's um what is it it's it's another like maid cafe type

2426
03:04:30,950 --> 03:04:41,690
thing it's i think it's like some moon themed maid cafe or
concept cafe whichever so there is no more spy bar Akiba CIA

2427
03:04:41,690 --> 03:04:47,010
I'm the Akiba Chiyoda intelligence agency I'm so I never got
the cow

2428
03:04:50,920 --> 03:05:03,760
I'll regret it for the rest of my afterlife I will I will
now it's Akiba Iris moon themed what does that mean It's

2429
03:05:03,760 --> 03:05:07,980
like, um, like, I don't, I think I took a picture of it.

2430
03:05:08,060 --> 03:05:09,820
Hold on, let me see if I can find it real quick.

2431
03:05:12,600 --> 03:05:17,700
Um, because I remember taking a picture and being like, Oh
my god, no, Akiba CIA.

2432
03:05:18,980 --> 03:05:21,520
Akiba CIA is gone.

2433
03:05:23,500 --> 03:05:26,020
Oh, I don't know when I took a picture of it, though.

2434
03:05:26,120 --> 03:05:27,500
It could have been any time.

2435
03:05:28,040 --> 03:05:28,780
It could have been.

2436
03:05:34,020 --> 03:05:38,080
I could have been on my old phone even.

2437
03:05:38,320 --> 03:05:38,710
I don't know.

2438
03:05:40,240 --> 03:05:40,940
Hold on.

2439
03:05:41,200 --> 03:05:44,140
I'll do a brief lookover.

2440
03:05:50,320 --> 03:05:51,320
Not here.

2441
03:05:52,320 --> 03:05:52,820
Is that it?

2442
03:05:53,240 --> 03:05:54,400
No, that's Umumosemir.

2443
03:05:57,040 --> 03:06:00,160
I don't want to take too much time I'm not looking for it,
you know.

2444
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:06,140
That's a comiquette.

2445
03:06:09,080 --> 03:06:09,940
I don't know.

2446
03:06:11,140 --> 03:06:13,020
Let me see if maybe we can time travel too.

2447
03:06:13,640 --> 03:06:13,900
Nope.

2448
03:06:14,660 --> 03:06:17,480
Yeah, but it's like a different concept cafe now.

2449
03:06:17,660 --> 03:06:18,340
So sad.

2450
03:06:19,180 --> 03:06:20,220
So, so sad.

2451
03:06:20,680 --> 03:06:24,200
But what's not sad is if you're looking for...

2452
03:06:24,200 --> 03:06:24,820
Wow, thank you!

2453
03:06:25,620 --> 03:06:28,560
I have expected to see you on the street view of Deer State.

2454
03:06:28,780 --> 03:06:29,220
Why?

2455
03:06:29,380 --> 03:06:32,360
I don't just stand out there all the time.

2456
03:06:34,040 --> 03:06:35,060
Oh, wait.

2457
03:06:35,640 --> 03:06:36,640
I think I'm reading the wrong one.

2458
03:06:37,180 --> 03:06:38,480
Oh, thank you.

2459
03:06:38,600 --> 03:06:39,580
Thank you for the tour of Akiba.

2460
03:06:39,720 --> 03:06:42,420
It was so cool seeing all the places.

2461
03:06:42,760 --> 03:06:45,880
I'm planning on visiting sometime next year, so I'll be sure
to check out your recommendations.

2462
03:06:46,380 --> 03:06:47,060
Yeah, of course.

2463
03:06:47,340 --> 03:06:47,880
Thank you.

2464
03:06:49,180 --> 03:06:53,640
If we didn't want to hear you fangirling, we wouldn't tune
in to watch you talk about your holy land.

2465
03:06:55,620 --> 03:06:55,980
Yeah.

2466
03:06:58,780 --> 03:07:00,280
A theater, a live theater.

2467
03:07:00,420 --> 03:07:07,360
So there's Twin Box Garage, which, to be honest, I've never
been to this.

2468
03:07:07,440 --> 03:07:08,800
Oh, wait, this is now an e-sports.

2469
03:07:09,620 --> 03:07:10,960
Oh, wait, they changed it.

2470
03:07:11,040 --> 03:07:12,640
So it's only this theater right in here.

2471
03:07:13,720 --> 03:07:16,120
Oh, this used to be a thing up here, too.

2472
03:07:16,660 --> 03:07:17,520
Okay, never mind.

2473
03:07:18,460 --> 03:07:25,440
But yeah, Twin Box Garage is a live house where you can
watch idols.

2474
03:07:25,960 --> 03:07:28,760
And sometimes even...

2475
03:07:29,820 --> 03:07:36,300
You'll see idols outside the station at, like outside
Akihabara station, and they'll be passing out flyers.

2476
03:07:36,460 --> 03:07:43,300
And this actually happened to me once where I saw some idols
and I was like, you know what, I'm gonna, I'm never seen

2477
03:07:43,300 --> 03:07:43,680
them before.

2478
03:07:43,840 --> 03:07:45,720
I'm gonna go out of my comfort zone a little bit.

2479
03:07:46,300 --> 03:07:54,100
And so I, um, I asked them like who were they were and they
told me who they were and they were like, yeah, actually

2480
03:07:54,100 --> 03:07:58,660
once, um, once a month we do a free show at Akihabara Twin
Box.

2481
03:07:58,780 --> 03:08:06,660
and we're doing one tonight so if you come you can see our
free show and i was like what that's so awesome is there a

2482
03:08:06,660 --> 03:08:13,680

dedicated place like deer stage um it's more like specific

2483
03:08:13,680 --> 03:08:21,360
events like you know sometimes there's like idol shows
though where it's like a bunch of idol groups it's called a

2484
03:08:21,360 --> 03:08:34,080
taiban for those shows where like you know 15 groups will be
performing but um but yeah I went and I saw them and I was

2485
03:08:34,080 --> 03:08:44,160
there with like five other people and everyone was staring
at the ghost girl who's who clearly was out of place but um

2486
03:08:44,160 --> 03:08:52,140
it was fun it was a lot of fun uh so hello welcome to
membership thank you I found a bunch of great idol groups

2487
03:08:52,140 --> 03:09:00,620

true Akiba idol show, Twin Box is a super awesome place to

2488
03:09:00,620 --> 03:09:01,300
go to.

2489
03:09:02,340 --> 03:09:05,380
There's also over here, Akibao, another one.

2490
03:09:05,720 --> 03:09:06,440
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2491
03:09:07,080 --> 03:09:18,540
But I'm also going to introduce one of my favorite made
cafes in Akihabara, right here.

2492
03:09:19,040 --> 03:09:20,260
Jam Akihabara.

2493
03:09:20,420 --> 03:09:23,240
So when you say the Akibao, when you say the Twin Box,
you're right here.

2494
03:09:23,260 --> 03:09:31,040
It's very easy to see because of all the because of all the
what's it called?

2495
03:09:31,360 --> 03:09:32,740
The landmarks.

2496
03:09:33,440 --> 03:09:43,460
I've mentioned Jam before but Jam Akihabara is again kind of

2506
03:10:48,560 --> 03:10:55,540
i'm not at deer stage so a normal cafe but you get to see
maids walking around exactly what's the name of the cafe

Um, Akikaru is a, uh...

03:11:40,270 --> 03:11:41,830
Is a, um...

2516
03:11:44,210 --> 03:11:45,490
Is a...

2517
03:11:45,490 --> 03:11:46,150
Magazine.

2518
03:11:46,510 --> 03:11:47,590
It's a free magazine.

2519
03:11:47,970 --> 03:11:49,350
Oh, it's redo of healer!

2520
03:11:49,410 --> 03:11:50,210
Oh my god, that's so funny.

2521
03:11:51,490 --> 03:11:52,130
Um...

2522
03:11:52,130 --> 03:11:53,190
Oh yeah, you're right!

2523
03:11:54,870 --> 03:11:56,310
I love jam.

2524
03:11:56,450 --> 03:11:57,150
Me too!

2525
03:11:59,590 --> 03:12:00,750
Me too!

2526
03:12:01,630 --> 03:12:11,210
But Akikaru is a free magazine that you'll see across in
certain places in Akihabara where they show...

2527
03:12:11,210 --> 03:12:13,890
It's just like an Akiba-themed magazine.

2528
03:12:14,130 --> 03:12:14,570
They're free.

2529
03:12:14,770 --> 03:12:15,850
You can take them for free.

2530
03:12:16,550 --> 03:12:20,210
They have like Akikaru models and stuff.

2531
03:12:20,410 --> 03:12:24,810
And sometimes they do interviews with them or they show off
new ads.

2532
03:12:24,830 --> 03:12:26,710
anime or new places in Akiba.

2533
03:12:27,290 --> 03:12:28,570
So, um, yeah.

2534
03:12:30,530 --> 03:12:31,050
Uh.

2535
03:12:33,470 --> 03:12:34,430
That's not redo.

2536
03:12:35,030 --> 03:12:37,470
That's the animal slave girl one.

2537
03:12:37,610 --> 03:12:37,970
Oh, it's not.

2538
03:12:39,470 --> 03:12:40,310
Oh, wait.

2539
03:12:40,430 --> 03:12:40,990
I thought, okay.

2540
03:12:41,490 --> 03:12:43,050
It's so hard to read backwards.

2541
03:12:43,450 --> 03:12:44,690
I thought it said healer.

2542
03:12:44,830 --> 03:12:45,430
Ha-rem.

2543
03:12:48,270 --> 03:12:49,330
I have no idea.

2544
03:12:49,650 --> 03:12:50,410
I have no idea.

2545
03:12:50,570 --> 03:12:51,910
I'm trusting whatever you guys say.

2546
03:12:59,350 --> 03:13:00,970
I don't know this one.

2547
03:13:01,490 --> 03:13:02,910
I don't know if it's even still there.

2548
03:13:03,810 --> 03:13:05,790
Maid Cafe sometimes come and go so quickly.

2549
03:13:08,330 --> 03:13:09,490
Which is a little sad.

2550
03:13:09,710 --> 03:13:11,290
Because if you find one that you really like.

2551
03:13:11,790 --> 03:13:13,170
But Jam has been there forever.

2552
03:13:13,930 --> 03:13:15,310
Like a really long time.

2553
03:13:15,850 --> 03:13:17,110
Really, really long time.

2554
03:13:22,170 --> 03:13:23,430
Um, here's a...

2555
03:13:23,430 --> 03:13:24,270

03:14:36,950 --> 03:14:45,390
Let's see, um, so if you're, again, if you're all turned
around, if you go down this way, you'll get to UDX and

2564
03:14:45,390 --> 03:14:49,150
you'll get to, um, the train station.

2565
03:14:49,670 --> 03:14:53,830
If you go down this way, which we are going to go down,
you'll get to Akiba Zetai Dyo-Iki.

2566
03:15:00,290 --> 03:15:02,290
I mean, you can drink water.

2567
03:15:05,150 --> 03:15:05,950
So true.

2568
03:15:06,450 --> 03:15:08,050
The no mi hoda is the water.

2569
03:15:11,010 --> 03:15:13,110
There's some other maid cafes in here.

2570
03:15:14,110 --> 03:15:14,250
Wait.

2571
03:15:16,150 --> 03:15:17,450
Wait, in here too?

2572
03:15:18,230 --> 03:15:19,110
Oh, no, here, here, sorry.

2573
03:15:20,510 --> 03:15:21,970
There's some other maid cafes in here.

2574
03:15:24,250 --> 03:15:25,950
There's like a...

2575
03:15:26,370 --> 03:15:27,950
I think this is the Danso.

2576
03:15:28,490 --> 03:15:29,010
Not Danso.

2577
03:15:29,210 --> 03:15:29,990
I think this is...

2578
03:15:29,990 --> 03:15:30,890
It might be Danso.

2579
03:15:31,050 --> 03:15:32,610
It might be Danso or it's Ikemen.

2580
03:15:32,770 --> 03:15:33,570
I can't remember.

2581
03:15:34,910 --> 03:15:42,910
there's an OL cafe down here as well so this is kind of like
the off the beaten path a little bit can I go please there

2582
03:15:42,910 --> 03:15:57,690
we go the back roads I'm so impressed by how much you know
about Akiba so cute stop it Maya stop it there's several

2583
03:15:57,690 --> 03:16:04,730
places back here that I want to mention though because
they're really cool IMHO why is everything closed I can't

2584
03:16:04,730 --> 03:16:06,050
tell where the...

2585
03:16:06,050 --> 03:16:07,170
Oh no, you guys, I can't...

2586
03:16:07,170 --> 03:16:09,110
Everything is blocked by the cars.

2587
03:16:09,290 --> 03:16:10,650
I can't tell where anything is.

2588
03:16:12,710 --> 03:16:13,150
Um...

2589
03:16:13,150 --> 03:16:16,670
I can't tell you guys where the OL Cafe is.

2590
03:16:22,800 --> 03:16:24,500
I think it's somewhere back there.

2591
03:16:24,580 --> 03:16:26,340
I think I passed it, but I couldn't see it.

2592
03:16:26,520 --> 03:16:27,180
Oh, time travel.

2593
03:16:27,280 --> 03:16:28,220
Yeah, we will in a second.

2594
03:16:29,340 --> 03:16:32,620
But before we time travel, I kind of mentioned cat cafes
before.

2595
03:16:33,020 --> 03:16:34,840
This one, I like this cat cafe.

2596
03:16:35,320 --> 03:16:36,520
It's called Neco Jalala.

2597
03:16:37,880 --> 03:16:46,520
and um it's it's pretty small but it's very cute the cats
are um i don't know i find it better than like the really

2598
03:16:46,520 --> 03:16:54,720
big open cat cafes because um obviously you get more people
in there so the cats are a little more tired in the big cat

2599
03:16:54,720 --> 03:17:03,480
cafes and um also because they're bigger there's less chance
of seeing a cat but here the cats are like everywhere

2600
03:17:03,480 --> 03:17:14,620
they're like all over the place they're up everywhere so I
recommend Neko Jalala if you want to go to a cat cafe in

2601
03:17:14,620 --> 03:17:25,500
Akihabara I have not heard anything bad about them so I hope
I hope it's okay and sometimes when you're walking by you

2602
03:17:25,500 --> 03:17:33,440
can see a cat in the window as well but it has a sign here
it says don't don't tap on the glass Don't hurt the cat.

2603
03:17:44,130 --> 03:17:45,090
Continuing onward.

2604
03:17:50,870 --> 03:17:52,030
More concept cafe?

2605
03:17:52,430 --> 03:17:52,930
Made cafe?

2606
03:17:53,430 --> 03:17:53,690
Perhaps.

2607
03:17:56,130 --> 03:17:57,090
I'm really...

2608
03:17:57,090 --> 03:17:58,470
Okay guys, I will...

2609
03:17:58,470 --> 03:18:02,170
Oh yeah, we'll travel back in time to see if we can find the
OL cafe too.

2610
03:18:02,590 --> 03:18:03,830
Sorry, I forgot about it a little bit.

2611
03:18:03,950 --> 03:18:06,190
Because I got distracted by this.

2612
03:18:07,350 --> 03:18:07,770
Ta-da!

2613
03:18:09,050 --> 03:18:09,770

This is a place called Milish, which is another maid cafe.

2617
03:18:18,770 --> 03:18:19,950
Sorry, I only know maid cafes.

2618
03:18:21,590 --> 03:18:27,330
But Milish is special because this is the maid cafe featured
in Sinesgate.

2619
03:18:29,510 --> 03:18:31,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

where they sit.

jam and like made dreaming and at home it's like just in

2625
03:19:13,530 --> 03:19:24,590
that middle where they still do a little bit of like maid
cafe fan service but they don't perform here it's like a

2626
03:19:24,590 --> 03:19:31,810
little chill but of course you have to go if you're a fan of
fan of Steinsgate they have like Steinsgate gotcha pon in

is a that is a good way to put it have you been to Akiba

2628
03:19:38,410 --> 03:19:46,730
Guild at all I have not because to be honest i don't care so
much about i mean i i was worried that it was more bar than

2629
03:19:46,730 --> 03:19:55,410
cafe you know because i was like there's like the whole
casino aspect and everything my buddy from kfp went there oh

2630
03:19:55,410 --> 03:20:10,550
nice what do you mean beginner um beginner in that like a
maid cafe like made dreaming or at home or some of the other

2631
03:20:10,570 --> 03:20:17,050
ones might be a little overwhelming in terms of how the
energy is but this one's a little more chill if you want to

2632
03:20:17,050 --> 03:20:27,370
see if you just kind of enjoy the made cafe vibe you know
it's not too weird or overwhelming yeah yeah exactly it's

2633
03:20:27,370 --> 03:20:34,950
pretty chill i'll be cringe and go as okabe and cosplay it's
not cringe at all in fact i'm sure people have done it

2634
03:20:34,950 --> 03:20:38,150
before yeah

2635
03:20:43,570 --> 03:20:44,910
I started with made dreaming.

2636
03:20:45,130 --> 03:20:45,930
That's okay too.

2637
03:20:47,650 --> 03:20:48,710
It's not bad.

2638
03:20:51,630 --> 03:20:55,210
Um, it's not bad at all to start with made dreaming.

2639
03:20:56,370 --> 03:21:01,630
But if you're looking, if you're just like trying to ease
someone into the made cafe world, you know, this is a good

2640
03:21:01,630 --> 03:21:02,490
one, probably.

2641
03:21:03,770 --> 03:21:05,890
Um, is there a Metal Gear made cafe?

2642
03:21:06,210 --> 03:21:08,890
Did you know there was a Metal Gear cafe in France?

2643
03:21:11,430 --> 03:21:13,550
Did you know that that existed?

2644
03:21:14,530 --> 03:21:15,730
In France?

2645
03:21:16,130 --> 03:21:16,430
Why?

2646
03:21:19,430 --> 03:21:21,190
It was like a pop-up cafe.

2647
03:21:22,050 --> 03:21:23,110
I'm pretty sure it was France.

2648
03:21:27,650 --> 03:21:27,970
Yeah.

2649
03:21:28,490 --> 03:21:30,130
I think it was for MGS 4.

2650
03:21:30,410 --> 03:21:31,490
No, 4 or 5.

2651
03:21:32,670 --> 03:21:33,070
Yeah.

2652
03:21:35,030 --> 03:21:36,750
It was somewhere in Europe.

2653
03:21:37,430 --> 03:21:39,190
It might have not been France, but...

2654
03:21:39,190 --> 03:21:39,450
Yeah.

2655
03:21:39,990 --> 03:21:41,190
It was a special event.

2656
03:21:42,750 --> 03:21:50,870
No, it's not there anymore It was just a pop-up I'm so
depressed But also, I would have had to go to France

Traffic is bad.

2691
03:26:06,610 --> 03:26:07,810
We're back at the Tam Tam.

2692
03:26:10,050 --> 03:26:12,370
So right there is Sui Hiroashi.

2693
03:26:12,370 --> 03:26:16,650
And this is all Chuo Dori.

2694
03:26:18,770 --> 03:26:19,730
And then down here.

2695
03:26:21,390 --> 03:26:22,390
Oh no, sorry.

2696
03:26:22,710 --> 03:26:23,150
Wrong street.

2697

This is Culture Zone.

2698
03:26:34,830 --> 03:26:36,610
Down here is Culture Zone.

2699
03:26:37,530 --> 03:26:38,550
And this is Chubby Maid Cafe.

2700
03:26:40,150 --> 03:26:41,510
This is Old Lady.

2701
03:26:43,550 --> 03:26:48,310
old lady the the old lady Sasquatch of Akihabara

2702
03:26:51,850 --> 03:26:59,270
what's the idol landscape like now compared to say 10 to 15
years ago do current idols look at 48 slash hello project

2703
03:26:59,270 --> 03:27:08,190
golden era as a big deal or is that now considered boomer
tier thanks for the tour thanks for the question i i think

2704
03:27:08,190 --> 03:27:15,810
now it is kind of boomer territory there's like a bunch of
groups and heroines that of the up-and-coming stuff.

2705
03:27:16,750 --> 03:27:26,270
Groups that are, idols that are big on TikTok are kind of
what's like taking over because a lot of girls have been

2706
03:27:26,270 --> 03:27:27,510
getting more into idols.

2707
03:27:28,870 --> 03:27:32,810
Especially like there's a group called I Life that's really
popular.

2708
03:27:33,170 --> 03:27:34,550
They're part of heroines.

2709
03:27:37,030 --> 03:27:42,910
But I would say that, yeah, and also K-pop has influenced
stuff a ton.

2710
03:27:45,830 --> 03:27:50,470
So, yeah, Fruit Zipper, Fruit Zipper is really big right
now.

2711
03:27:52,290 --> 03:27:59,890
It is kind of like, not to say that there's not people that
still admire Hello Project, because Hello Project is still a

2712
03:27:59,890 --> 03:28:05,230
group, and of course, AKB is still a group and everything,
but, um, yeah.

2713
03:28:06,670 --> 03:28:10,090
The whole wave of Chica idols that take after Omori Seiko
are fun.

2714
03:28:12,010 --> 03:28:12,530
Yeah.

2715
03:28:13,290 --> 03:28:13,810
Yeah.

2716
03:28:14,750 --> 03:28:16,070
Yeah, yeah.

2717
03:28:18,070 --> 03:28:19,490
So, I don't know.

2718
03:28:19,770 --> 03:28:20,870
It's hard to say.

2719
03:28:24,260 --> 03:28:25,740
Times just grow and change.

2720
03:28:25,940 --> 03:28:26,280
That's all.

2721
03:28:27,640 --> 03:28:28,600
Exactly, exactly.

2722
03:28:30,780 --> 03:28:35,480
When I was in Japan last, I went to Tower Records.

2723
03:28:37,800 --> 03:28:40,960
And as I was walking in, there was a big group of people.

2724
03:28:41,160 --> 03:28:42,560
And I was like, whoa, what's going on?

2725
03:28:42,860 --> 03:28:44,960
And there was AKB signing a...

2726
03:28:45,200 --> 03:28:47,580
A big, a poster in the front of the store.

2727
03:28:49,060 --> 03:28:59,380
And I thought to myself, I was like, if I, if this had been
me, like, if this had been me 10 years ago, I would have

2728
03:28:59,380 --> 03:29:02,100
probably, I would have auto-conned it all over the floor.

2729
03:29:02,540 --> 03:29:04,260
I would have auto-conned all over the floor.

2730
03:29:04,800 --> 03:29:10,340
I would have been like, like, I just would have lost my
mind.

2731
03:29:13,060 --> 03:29:15,180
But, um, yeah.

2732
03:29:15,640 --> 03:29:17,640
But I kind of was just like, oh, that's neat.

2733
03:29:17,780 --> 03:29:18,760
And then I went on my way.

2734
03:29:21,340 --> 03:29:23,420
Not a fan of that verb.

2735
03:29:24,140 --> 03:29:25,740
Don't say it like that.

2736
03:29:27,020 --> 03:29:28,820
But you know what I mean.

2737
03:29:35,450 --> 03:29:35,710
Yeah.

2738
03:29:41,790 --> 03:29:42,190
Uh.

2739
03:29:44,990 --> 03:29:45,390
Anyway.

2740
03:29:46,990 --> 03:29:47,390
Well.

2741
03:29:48,130 --> 03:29:49,930
I've skipped over a bunch of stuff.

2742
03:29:50,070 --> 03:29:52,330
But I think this might be a good place to...

2743
03:29:52,350 --> 03:30:11,590
call it um oh wait we were gonna go back in time for the uh
for the um the ol cafe maybe i've been actually quite tired

2744
03:30:11,590 --> 03:30:21,230
because um okay guys announcement actually some of you
already know this but that's okay if you are on the patreon

2745
03:30:24,150 --> 03:30:26,010
I got a second cat!

2746
03:30:27,610 --> 03:30:30,610
I thought Otakon meant the other thing he's known for doing.

2747
03:30:31,950 --> 03:30:32,150
Hmm?

2748
03:30:33,710 --> 03:30:34,550
What's that?

2749
03:30:34,730 --> 03:30:36,410
Wait, actually, wait, what do you mean?

03:30:36,630 --> 03:30:37,210

03:30:38,530 --> 03:30:40,110
Yeah, I got another cat!

2753
03:30:41,230 --> 03:30:43,010
She's so cute.

2754
03:30:43,690 --> 03:30:48,590
I hadn't announced it sooner because I was, like, kind of
wanting to see how...

2755
03:30:49,370 --> 03:31:04,730
how um how uh butaro reacted to her um but uh they're
getting along ish they're only hissing sometimes um but i

2756
03:31:04,730 --> 03:31:12,610

what if she doesn't get along with my cat and um then i have

2757
03:31:12,610 --> 03:31:15,130
to like you know what if it's like really bad to The point.

03:31:15,770 --> 03:31:16,830
Mintu already told us?

2759
03:31:17,050 --> 03:31:18,110

Well, okay.

2767
03:31:54,560 --> 03:31:56,520
Let me explain why I've been so tired then.

2768

because do you know how exhausting it's been like taking

Yeah, but like when last night?

2775
03:32:57,710 --> 03:32:58,730
Gosh, I don't remember at all.

2776
03:32:58,990 --> 03:33:02,330
No, I know I did Bunny Garden yesterday, but I don't
remember when I said it last night.

2777
03:33:03,650 --> 03:33:04,530
Someone asked about it.

2778
03:33:04,630 --> 03:33:05,830
Oh, and I was...

2779
03:33:05,830 --> 03:33:09,530
That's probably why I don't remember because I...

2780
03:33:11,930 --> 03:33:12,730
Because I...

2781
03:33:14,210 --> 03:33:15,390
Because I was thinking of...

2782
03:33:15,390 --> 03:33:18,430
You know, because it was brought up as a super chat.

2783
03:33:18,710 --> 03:33:19,310
Okay, I remember.

2784
03:33:19,450 --> 03:33:20,690
Okay, I remember now!

2785
03:33:21,790 --> 03:33:23,530
I remember now, I remember now.

2786
03:33:26,930 --> 03:33:28,590
Yeah, I said the new one wasn't Sinky.

2787
03:33:29,170 --> 03:33:30,770
I remember, I remember, I remember.

2788
03:33:31,710 --> 03:33:39,310
I also have to remember that with Bunny Garden, my brain was
entirely on the assets.

2789
03:33:41,390 --> 03:33:42,170
I remember, I remember.

2790
03:33:42,330 --> 03:33:44,030
Or, I mean, wasn't yesterday Majong?

2791
03:33:44,310 --> 03:33:45,090
Yeah, it was Majong.

2792
03:33:47,730 --> 03:33:48,730
Now I'm confused.

2793
03:33:48,890 --> 03:33:51,110
You guys are older than I am.

2794
03:33:51,170 --> 03:33:53,510
You guys said Bunny Garden yesterday.

2795
03:33:56,730 --> 03:33:58,330
Yesterday was Majang.

2796
03:34:05,320 --> 03:34:06,900
You guys said bunny...

2797
03:34:06,900 --> 03:34:08,740
You guys are gaslighting me.

2798
03:34:09,080 --> 03:34:10,500
You guys said bunny garden.

2799
03:34:13,280 --> 03:34:14,920
Then it was two days ago.

2800
03:34:15,240 --> 03:34:16,760
We are tired, too.

2801
03:34:18,760 --> 03:34:21,480
It was bunny garden because I missed yesterday.

2802
03:34:22,420 --> 03:34:23,160
Well, then there we go.

2803
03:34:23,720 --> 03:34:25,360
I was focused on the assets, okay?

2804
03:34:27,480 --> 03:34:40,780
made me leak through my ears so okay grandma time for bed

hope that this was different enough from the last time that

2806
03:34:46,420 --> 03:34:55,280
I did the tour so that um you know you could see hopefully
here's some new things I mean things have updated in akiba

2807
03:34:55,280 --> 03:35:04,220

2811
03:35:29,260 --> 03:35:31,360
Thank you so much for that spooky super chat.

2812
03:35:31,940 --> 03:35:34,100
Hope to visit Akiba Sunday so I was taking notes.

2813
03:35:34,260 --> 03:35:36,320
Maybe I can go see the Made Mint, Made Cafe.

2814
03:35:38,200 --> 03:35:41,360
I hope one day I can collab with the Made Cafe.

2815
03:35:41,800 --> 03:35:42,580
That'd be crazy.

2816
03:35:44,760 --> 03:35:45,500
Maybe one day.

2817
03:35:46,060 --> 03:35:47,000
I gotta get bigger.

2818
03:35:49,580 --> 03:35:51,520
Maybe I got to get picker.

2819
03:35:53,140 --> 03:35:53,620
Where are we at?

2820
03:35:54,720 --> 03:35:56,020
No, no, no, no, no.

2821
03:35:57,120 --> 03:35:58,120
No, no, no.

2822
03:35:58,220 --> 03:36:00,300
I think 2022 is our best bet.

2823
03:36:01,200 --> 03:36:03,680
Because it has moved around a little bit.

2824
03:36:05,000 --> 03:36:05,980
The OL Cafe.

2825
03:36:12,480 --> 03:36:13,580
I'll find it.

2826
03:36:19,600 --> 03:36:20,160
Someday.

2827
03:36:21,640 --> 03:36:22,460
Here's a tip.

2828
03:36:22,560 --> 03:36:23,800
Don't quit your day job.

2829
03:36:24,000 --> 03:36:24,500
Heyo.

2830
03:36:26,500 --> 03:36:27,460
Here's an advice.

2831
03:36:27,480 --> 03:36:29,420
Take this dip stop.

2832
03:36:31,360 --> 03:36:37,280
Yeah, who would quit their day job to stream?

2833
03:36:37,680 --> 03:36:39,760
That's so silly.

2834
03:36:41,600 --> 03:36:45,620
That's actually like the worst idea ever.

2835
03:36:48,180 --> 03:36:51,120
That's like, who would risk it all?

2836
03:36:51,600 --> 03:36:53,100
Who would risk it for the biscuit?

2837
03:36:57,690 --> 03:36:58,610
Ugh.

2838
03:36:59,810 --> 03:37:01,330
This is so much fun, you guys.

2839
03:37:03,350 --> 03:37:07,210
I thought I would have to cancel because my head has been
hurting these past couple of days.

2840
03:37:07,610 --> 03:37:11,790
Probably because I've been just a little stressed out about
the cats.

2841
03:37:12,850 --> 03:37:14,330
And just some other stuff, too.

2842
03:37:18,390 --> 03:37:21,610
But, you know, I'm doing my best.

2843
03:37:23,730 --> 03:37:26,170
Going in October, this gave me some great ideas on where to
go.

2844
03:37:26,310 --> 03:37:26,690
Thanks, man.

2845
03:37:26,950 --> 03:37:27,870
Thanks, Bragg.

2846
03:37:28,050 --> 03:37:28,690
Oh, my gosh.

2847
03:37:28,730 --> 03:37:29,790
I can't wait to hear all about it.

2848
03:37:30,690 --> 03:37:36,690
you can be the Anna Miller's mascot because they're dead too
who's Anna Miller

2849
03:37:41,570 --> 03:37:54,750
I'm going to Japan in September thank you for the Rex yeah

2850
03:37:54,750 --> 03:38:02,930
tomorrow and hope you guys liked this tour hopefully I'm
glad if it gave you some recommendations, some ideas of how

2851
03:38:02,930 --> 03:38:07,850
to get around Akihabara so when you go, you don't feel
entirely lost or overwhelmed.

2852
03:38:08,650 --> 03:38:11,130
And yeah, thank you for risking it.

2853
03:38:11,210 --> 03:38:12,690
Here's some money for the biscuits.

2854
03:38:13,110 --> 03:38:13,870
This tour was fine.

2855
03:38:13,950 --> 03:38:14,570
Thank you.

2856
03:38:15,230 --> 03:38:16,530
Yeah, we'll do a part two.

2857
03:38:17,230 --> 03:38:19,750
Isn't the Kandam Yodin Mu stairs down here too?

2858
03:38:19,870 --> 03:38:21,310
Yes, it is.

2859
03:38:23,510 --> 03:38:24,390
Right here.

2860
03:38:28,350 --> 03:38:29,790
This is actually the stick.

2861
03:38:29,810 --> 03:38:31,530
Oh, that's a wall.

2862
03:38:32,630 --> 03:38:34,370
This is the stairs to Kandam Yodin.

2863
03:38:34,970 --> 03:38:36,970
The stairs that they go to in Love Live.

2864
03:38:39,870 --> 03:38:41,350
That they run up and down.

2865
03:38:43,770 --> 03:38:44,990
Thanks for reminding me.

2866
03:38:45,830 --> 03:38:47,870
What do you feed for your new kiddie mint?

2867
03:38:48,010 --> 03:38:53,790
Oh, I don't really want to get into it because I've been a
little stressed about it.

2868
03:38:56,330 --> 03:38:57,290
Basically, my...

2869
03:38:57,290 --> 03:38:58,850
Butaro, he stopped eating.

2870
03:38:59,810 --> 03:39:06,810
him to the vet they were like he's really healthy but he's
lost two pounds and so i was really stressed about that

2871
03:39:06,810 --> 03:39:11,650
because he had he i kept having to give him some medicine
which would stress him out because he had like something

2872
03:39:11,650 --> 03:39:17,310
going on on his arm and so that was stressing out and then
stressing him out and then the new cat was stressing him out

2873
03:39:17,310 --> 03:39:26,830
and then he was getting skinny and so he just wasn't eating
a lot and so um uh i've had to start cooking him chicken

2874
03:39:26,830 --> 03:39:31,370
like actual He won't eat anything else.

2875
03:39:32,870 --> 03:39:34,450
My spoiled cat.

2876
03:39:35,230 --> 03:39:38,010

Uh...

2880

So, yeah, I was really stressed about that.

2881
03:39:45,690 --> 03:39:46,070
Because I was...

2882
03:39:46,070 --> 03:39:49,170
I would just, like, sit there trying to get him to eat
anything.

2883
03:39:49,730 --> 03:39:51,690
And I was just, like, sitting on the floor crying.
