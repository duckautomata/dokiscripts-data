1
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,520
Welcome, Master!

2
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,380
Hello everybody.

3
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,240
Where are we?

4
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,320
Oh my gosh.

5
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,020
Where is this place?

6
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,040
We are getting turned around.

7
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,260
Welcome everybody aboard the USS Hornet!

8
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,820
And hello to you.

9
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:38,980
Hey!

10
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,420
Who let the ghost in?

11
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,720
Is that a ghost?

12
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,740
Oh my gosh!

13
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,440
How are you doing Ms. Smith?

14
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,960
I'm good, how are you?

15
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,120
I'm doing well today.

16
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:58,060
Welcome aboard the USS Hornet Sea, Air and Space Museum in beautiful sunny Alameda, California.

17
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,460
Welcome aboard everybody watching.

18
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,960
Glad to have you aboard today.

19
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,880
Yay!

20
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,840
Welcome aboard everybody.

21
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,320
Alright, so, where do you want to start?

22
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,600
Wait, do you want to do a little introduction first?

23
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,580
Tell everybody who you are, what you're doing, everything you got going on.

24
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,120
Hi, my name is Jeff.

25
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,480
I work on ship.

26
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,480
I do ship things.

27
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,940
Oh wait, sorry, let me rephrase.

28
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,240
Hi, I'm Jeffrey here at Battleship New Jersey Museum.

29
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,720
Oh wait, sorry, wrong curator.

30
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,580
Hi everyone, my name is Gabriel Cherry.

31
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,660
I am the marketing manager here at the USS Hornet Sea, Air and Space Museum.

32
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,840
And I will be your tour guide today as we show Ms. Mint the museum, USS Hornet CV-12.

33
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,020
Specifically CV-12, because here's a little nugget for you to start the tour.

34
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,340
This is the second USS Hornet aircraft carrier, meaning there was an aircraft carrier that preceded it.

35
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,400
Who here in chat knows about the Doolittle raid?

36
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:11,040
Well, the USS Hornet CV-8, which was the aircraft carrier that preceded USS Hornet CV-12, is the aircraft carrier that is famous for launching the Doolittle raid several months after the attack on Pearl Harbor back in World War II.

37
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,780
This ship is a memorial to that ship that sunk in the Battle of Santa Cruz.

38
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,220
So she not only carries the legacy of CV-8, but also, and we'll show this as well.

39
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,000
There are more ships that were called USS Hornets.

40
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,300
Specifically, there were 8 ships called Hornets.

41
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,460
Dating back to the American Revolution all the way back in 1775.

42
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,360
Hornets 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

43
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:48,120
Well, realistically, these are just different versions of CV-12, but there were 8 USS Hornets throughout that history.

44
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,860
Oh my god, that's crazy!

45
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,620
So, this is technically the 9th version that holds the name.

46
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,360
But, currently right now, USS Hornet is the only ship the Navy has named Hornet, so she still holds the name today.

47
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,680
I like the little hornet down there.

48
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,720
Are we tall enough, you think?

49
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,440
I don't know.

50
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,440
Are we tall enough?

51
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,900
This is Buzz.

52
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,220
He's our mascot here at the museum.

53
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:14,520
Hi!

54
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,760
Buzz!

55
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,320
He's not really like Buzz Lightyear, but you know, he's buzzing around the place.

56
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,600
Nice cooler.

57
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,140
Okay, so, we're going to get the tour started here.

58
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,360
Yippee!

59
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:37,120
Now, first of all, the Hornet was laid down in 1942.

60
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,220
August of 1942, right?

61
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,480
See this aircraft here?

62
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,560
Mr. Cameraman, you can pan around.

63
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,540
Let's see just how big this space is.

64
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,300
Mannequin.

65
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,480
I like the lights over there.

66
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,540
Yeah, we're having a rave.

67
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We have had raves here before.

68
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,100
Believe it or not.

69
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,380
Wait, actually?

70
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,120
Yeah, actually.

71
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,840
We actually have had private events here where we had a rave called Rattleship.

72
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:11,380
And it was this major 4,000 plus person event that we had here on the ship and it was this major rave that happened.

73
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,600
Oh, my God.

74
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,440
You heard it, everybody.

75
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,480
If you need a party.

76
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,060
Hey, party on the ship.

77
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,680
That's all I'm saying.

78
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,040
But, where we are right now is the hangar deck.

79
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,400
Now, most people think, oh, it's the hangar.

80
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,500
It's where the airplanes are stored.

81
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,120
No.

82
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,580
United States Navy doctrine dictates the aircraft need to be stored on the flight deck.

83
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,360
They're stored up there and tied down to little notches down in the ground.

84
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,980
So, I'll show you here.

85
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,260
You can't really see it because it's imprinted here on the ground.

86
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,700
So, Mr. Cameraman, you can take a closer look there.

87
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,520
There's usually little tie-downs here that hook into the ground.

88
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,460
You can also find these on the flight deck and they tie the aircraft down to prevent it from sliding off.

89
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,920
It would store them up there.

90
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,300
During World War II, Hornet had a flight complement of almost over 300 aircraft.

91
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,440
That's during World War II, back when we had smaller propeller-driven aircraft.

92
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,980
So, we'll stop with the aircraft here.

93
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,260
We'll talk about World War II.

94
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:15,920
Matter of fact, right here is Hornet's entire World War II history.

95
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,720
Oh my god!

96
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,720
That is all the planes, ships, and battles that the Hornet fought.

97
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,280
Whoa!

98
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,580
Oh my god!

99
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,700
So, each one of those...

100
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,460
Matter of fact, Hornet's actually responsible for sinking battleship Yamato.

101
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,100
So, Akankale fans, I'm sorry this ship sunk.

102
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,680
RIP, Akankale fans.

103
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,780
Oh no, Yamato.

104
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,540
Oh my god.

105
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,460
Propeller aircraft.

106
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,700
In World War II, the United States Navy was at a distinct disadvantage at the outbreak of the war.

107
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,720
The Japanese Zeros were lighter, more maneuverable, and had more powerful weapons at the time.

108
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,380
What you see right here is the training variant of the FN-2.

109
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,860
The FN-2 is one of the smaller propeller aircraft in the war.

110
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,620
This training variant was used to train pilots up in the Great Lakes.

111
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,240
So, landing on an aircraft carrier is one of the most difficult things you can do as a pilot.

112
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:22,980
It's on the water, it's moving up and down, left and right, and you have to be able to hit a specific mark on the aircraft carrier deck to be able to catch that hook.

113
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,440
We'll talk about tail hooks in a minute.

114
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:32,600
So, the fun part about this aircraft in our collection is that it was actually found at the bottom of Lake Michigan.

115
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,160
Oh!

116
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,120
What's it doing there?

117
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,880
Well, it was a training accident.

118
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,060
So, the pilot ejected and it jumped in the bottom of Lake Michigan.

119
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,660
This aircraft was soon found and brought to the USS Hornet and fully restored by our team here.

120
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:47,960
Wow!

121
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,040
That's another interesting fact.

122
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,860
All the aircraft you see here are restored by the USS Hornet volunteers.

123
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,720
Nobody's paid.

124
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,580
There are no government contracts.

125
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,020
We get no support from the government.

126
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,880
We get grants like any other museum.

127
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,400
But it's all volunteers that come here and give their time.

128
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,300
Oh my God!

129
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,620
Wait, what have you done then?

130
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,060
Man, I don't want to do this no more.

131
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:26,980
Sorry!

132
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,300
You're giving a wonderful tour for us.

133
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:29,900
Thank you.

134
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,600
Why are you bullying me?

135
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,300
I give a crap about the ship.

136
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,600
I like that Mike Chad is calling you Gabe Jeff.

137
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,680
Hi, my name is Gabe Jeff.

138
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,360
Gabe Jeff.

139
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,680
Gabe Jeff at your service.

140
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,240
But this represented the early part of the war.

141
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:02,800
The latter half of the war, post-US battle of Midway, the United States Navy learned a thing or two about how to design their aircraft to counter the Japanese.

142
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,160
Now, this is Miss June.

143
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,940
Everybody say hi, Miss June.

144
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,480
Hi, Miss June.

145
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,200
You look lovely today.

146
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,920
Miss June's a hag, so we have to be kinder.

147
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,060
She's a hag YouTuber.

148
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,700
Don't worry.

149
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,040
We're going to upgrade her.

150
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,940
We're going to get LTV.

151
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,220
We're going to do the whole thing.

152
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,060
Hags are in demand, right?

153
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,320
That's what I'm saying.

154
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,320
Miss June, I'm told we could do...

155
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,940
She doesn't know me.

156
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:40,480
But Miss June is a TVM adventure torpedo bomber.

157
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:52,680
Now, during World War II, and it would come around the latter half of World War I, in the interim war period, torpedo bombers were considered the pinnacle of naval warfare technology.

158
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,160
Why?

159
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:09,540
Because you could take a warhead, which is a torpedo, and you could fly it as close as you could to a ship and slam it into the side, knocking it, making a giant hole in the ship, making it take on water and sinking it.

160
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,580
Oh, my God.

161
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,140
What the torpedo you see right here is representative of the Mark...

162
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,800
I believe it's the Mark... Yes, the Mark 19 torpedo.

163
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,360
It's about 1,600 pounds.

164
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,040
1,600 pounds!

165
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,620
Yes.

166
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,560
I could take it.

167
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,840
Now, this is a prop.

168
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,340
Yeah, you could totally lift it.

169
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:29,740
It's fine.

170
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:30,980
Go, bro.

171
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,660
Go, bro.

172
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,740
Mental goes to the gym.

173
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,080
Yeah.

174
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,320
You know what I mean?

175
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:33,900
Gym art.

176
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,680
Mental games.

177
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,060
Training art.

178
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,580
We got this.

179
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,800
Back to mental games.

180
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,960
Well, this torpedo would be carried...

181
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,160
The payload would be carried by Miss June, along with a crew of three.

182
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,220
And you notice how large this aircraft is.

183
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,980
Now, for reference, for everybody at home, I am 6'5".

184
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,320
Oh!

185
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,320
Notice how big this girl is.

186
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,320
She is a biggin'.

187
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,920
She is a biggin', alright.

188
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,660
But she has a big payload.

189
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,740
Now, the TDM torpedo bomber was regarded as one of the best torpedo bombers because of its armament.

190
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,460
But also, it was resilient.

191
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,520
It could take hits.

192
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,540
It would not go down without a fight.

193
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,840
And it could take a lot of bullet holes and get back their crew safely.

194
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,400
So, American pilots had a higher retention, lower casualty rate with this aircraft than they would with counterparts on the Japanese side.

195
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:25,760
See?

196
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,100
You gotta get them thick.

197
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,280
Exactly.

198
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,420
You gotta get them dummy thick.

199
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,300
Miss June, you're dummy thick.

200
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,300
I'm sayin'.

201
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,600
Yeah.

202
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,260
So, you notice how this aircraft has folded wings.

203
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,000
You notice how this aircraft has folded wings.

204
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,700
It's a wildcat.

205
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

206
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,840
Miss Mint, why do you think that is?

207
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,060
Storage?

208
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,560
Oh.

209
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,200
Plus five points for Miss Mint.

210
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:51,960
Yippee!

211
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,260
You wanna get as many aircraft on the carrier as possible.

212
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,580
And the only way you're gonna do that is if you find a way to fold the wings.

213
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,720
Because the wings take a majority of the space.

214
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,200
But if you fold them and you put them on the flight deck nice and tight, packed to each other.

215
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,940
They still do this in the Navy today.

216
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,300
All naval aircraft have foldable wings.

217
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,700
They fold them up and they store them and take them where they need to go around the world.

218
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,460
Because the whole point of the Navy is to have presence around the world 24-7.

219
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,540
To be able to extend our reach.

220
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,460
So, every aircraft has this.

221
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,360
It's controlled by hydraulic systems that move these wings into position up and down.

222
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,080
But, here's the thing though.

223
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:39,780
Aircraft are never to be fueled, nor do they have their weapons put on them on the hangar deck.

224
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,800
That is too dangerous.

225
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,980
You're essentially creating a tinderbox.

226
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,980
Because if you have everybody running around.

227
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,580
And let's say we're at war.

228
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,300
It's World War II.

229
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,540
Someone drops a bomb in here.

230
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,460
And there's fuel and there's bombs and there's ammunition.

231
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:52,960
Everywhere.

232
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,820
It's like the biggest explosion ever.

233
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,020
It did happen in World War II during the Battle of Midway.

234
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,500
A lot of the aircraft carriers of the Japanese, most notably the Akagi.

235
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,640
Actually had an implosion upon one bomb drop that penetrated the deck.

236
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,140
Exploded the entire interior of the hangar deck.

237
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,860
Because of how much fuel, weapons, and men were moving during the time.

238
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,500
It caused a whole new reaction that destroyed the carrier.

239
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,800
Oh my god!

240
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,240
They learned fast from that then.

241
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,160
We learned fast from that too.

242
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,200
So here's what happens.

243
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,320
This area is armored from that.

244
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,540
There are major hangar bay wars.

245
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,820
You guys can see down a ways over there.

246
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,620
Part of the hangar bay is already closed.

247
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,540
We're able to seal off parts of the hangar deck in case there's a fire.

248
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,740
So that way we can go ahead and keep operating.

249
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,260
But also damage control crews can focus on one area.

250
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:44,680
What?

251
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,080
Oh wow, that's so intuitive.

252
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,640
Oh my god.

253
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,700
The Essex class was designed with the lessons learned from the past.

254
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,080
So they wanted to be able to take what they...

255
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,040
The name is all about evolution, all about learning, all about doing it better the next time.

256
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,180
So they took what they learned from the Japanese, applied it to the carriers going forward.

257
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,400
But as we move on, World War II ended.

258
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,620
So, what happened with aircraft?

259
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,920
Well, they got bigger.

260
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,300
They got heavier.

261
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,620
They went faster.

262
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,500
They had bigger engines, more propulsion.

263
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,780
And because they got bigger, we could only carry little aircraft.

264
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,080
We couldn't carry less aircraft.

265
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,420
Here's an example of one aircraft.

266
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,420
The F-22.

267
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,340
Now, the F-22 is an amazing aircraft.

268
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,320
I love this aircraft.

269
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,380
Want to know why?

270
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:38,840
Why?

271
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,080
Because it don't need no missiles to be great.

272
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,480
We don't need a shotgun.

273
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,040
We don't need a lock-on with missiles.

274
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,420
The F-22 is known as the last gunfighter.

275
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,040
Because you know why?

276
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,820
It only had guns.

277
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,920
It had its machine guns.

278
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,160
It did not have missiles.

279
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,980
It had unguided bombs.

280
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,820
But it was an interceptor dogfighter.

281
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,180
People who pilot aircraft were trained for air-to-air combat.

282
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,900
I'm not good at dogfighting.

283
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,920
I got it.

284
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,360
We'll teach you.

285
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:10,860
Okay.

286
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,240
We'll get you right.

287
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:13,500
Okay.

288
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,760
You notice these doors right here?

289
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,780
This is where the cannons will shoot out.

290
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,400
Down in the interior right here, just so you can see what the jet intake looks like.

291
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,880
Yeah.

292
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,860
It is dangerous, but I'm going to stick my head in there anyways.

293
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,340
Echo!

294
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:30,900
Echo!

295
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,360
Echo!

296
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,040
Good morning, Vento!

297
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,120
The engine will be inside of here.

298
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,000
And it will be sucking air through here to be able to create propulsion on the other side.

299
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,180
I have a question.

300
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,140
How often do birds get in there and stuff?

301
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,240
What if a bird gets in there?

302
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,520
Well, if a bird gets in there, you better enjoy the ejector seat.

303
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,320
Like you're going to Disneyland for free.

304
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,400
Oh, jeez.

305
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,740
Well, not necessarily free.

306
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,900
It costs maybe a couple billion dollars, but still.

307
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:06,840
Yes.

308
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,420
And I'll show you this right here before we leave this part of the ship.

309
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:19,360
What do I think that is?

310
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,100
What do you think it is, Ms. Schmidt?

311
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,160
A missile?

312
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,140
It's alright.

313
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,220
What type of missile?

314
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,080
Torpedo?

315
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,900
I don't know.

316
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,420
I'll give you a hint.

317
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,300
It makes a very, very big boom.

318
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,820
Like a nuke?

319
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:50,260
Back in the Cold War, it's theorized that the USS Hornet may or may not have had nuclear weapons aboard.

320
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:51,840
Uh-oh.

321
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:52,820
Metal gear.

322
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,840
This is an example of a nuclear warhead that the Hornet may or may not have had.

323
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,020
Wow.

324
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,060
I feel like it's smaller than what I would think of.

325
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,900
Big things come in small packages.

326
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:12,920
That's true.

327
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,440
That's me.

328
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,020
That is you.

329
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:15,640
There you go.

330
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:15,900
See?

331
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,500
You're a nuclear warhead super.

332
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,640
You're a big, big explosion.

333
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,560
We love it.

334
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,360
We love to see it.

335
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,980
I'm the big explosion.

336
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,100
During the Cold War, we would not say that we had the nukes aboard.

337
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,460
But this is an example of a warhead that would be kept.

338
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:38,260
We do not know exactly which ships had warheads because the Navy will not disclose that.

339
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,240
We can neither confirm nor deny.

340
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,380
Where would they... if those hypothetically would be stored on a ship, where would those be kept?

341
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:55,280
If I told you, I'd have to go home and tell my mom I'm sorry I spoiled it.

342
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:55,840
Hi, Mom.

343
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,280
Sorry.

344
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,600
Dang.

345
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,380
My sneaking mission is getting thwarted.

346
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,940
Are there any questions before we continue?

347
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,480
Yeah.

348
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,060
Chat, if you guys have any questions, feel free.

349
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,940
I will try and catch some.

350
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,540
Let's see what they have.

351
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,460
Feel free to interrupt anytime if you have questions.

352
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:15,960
Yeah.

353
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,500
Thank you.

354
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,940
Yeah, yeah.

355
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,020
Are you single?

356
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,480
What?

357
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,760
Listen, I am in a beautiful relationship with my body pillow.

358
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,920
It has the aircraft carrier with anime eyes on it.

359
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,820
I am happy.

360
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,480
You heard it here, you guys.

361
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,040
I'm sorry.

362
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,380
You don't stand a chance against that.

363
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,530
Actually, someone was asking about Azure Lane.

364
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,410
If you want to explain what you've done with Azure Lane before.

365
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,770
We have actually done multiple collaborations with Azure Lane.

366
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:03,670
They have actually helped support our anime and gaming convention called Carrier Con.

367
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,130
They have had a boost here, but also we've done merch.

368
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,790
We actually currently have a merch collab going on with them.

369
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,070
If you come to the ship, you can actually buy some of that merch.

370
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,650
You can also find it on our website.

371
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:21,650
But we also have done other collaborations, such as two years ago now, we hosted the Azure Lane 5th anniversary event here at the ship where we had cosplayers.

372
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,730
We had a whole show and we celebrated Azure Lane's five years.

373
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,310
That's so awesome.

374
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,250
We love doing events like that here at the ship because you know why?

375
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:38,350
It's about getting you, the audience, whatever you're into, showing you, hey Hornet, we're open to it.

376
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,190
We love you guys.

377
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,050
I want you guys to connect with the ship in your own unique way.

378
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,490
I have two more questions from people.

379
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,550
Someone asked, how many aircraft can this carrier carry?

380
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,070
So that would depend on the era.

381
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,130
Is there a specific era?

382
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:56,750
If we're talking about World War II, that would be over 400 aircraft.

383
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:02,010
Talking during the Cold War, that would be about 100, depending on what type of aircraft we're talking about.

384
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:05,150
Because like I said, World War II aircraft were smaller.

385
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,590
Not you, Miss June.

386
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,330
Not you.

387
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:09,490
Smaller.

388
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,510
They were more compact.

389
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,990
We could even hang them from the rafters.

390
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,250
Cameraman, if you could show above.

391
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,650
We could hang them from above.

392
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:25,560
But when aircraft like the F-4 came along and notice how big she is.

393
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,120
That's saying you're not big.

394
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,960
We love you.

395
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:39,920
But when aircraft like the F-8 came along, that's when we had to adjust and the Hornet, unfortunately, became an outdated carrier.

396
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:50,600
That's why the class that came after it, USS Midway, if anybody's been to San Diego, California, USS Midway is down there as a museum, is a much bigger aircraft carrier and can support larger aircraft.

397
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,140
And that's why she stayed in service from almost 1945 all the way to the 90s.

398
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,740
Because she was able to be upgraded to be able to carry and support larger aircraft.

399
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,520
The Hornet, unfortunately, was decommissioned in 1972.

400
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:10,000
But everything you see here, folks, and this is fun fact, is as you see it from when it was decommissioned in 1972.

401
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,640
The Hornet is a National Historical Landmark and has not been changed or altered in any way.

402
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:23,000
Obviously, it was gone to become a museum, but it's still authentic to what it was during the period.

403
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,760
Any other questions?

404
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,360
Next question?

405
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,680
Yeah, I have more.

406
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,640
Someone asked, I think they noticed your shirt.

407
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,440
They wanted to know if you served on any Navy ships and your background with the Navy.

408
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,460
Unfortunately not.

409
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,100
I actually gained my graduate degree.

410
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,200
And once I get my graduate degree, I am considering applying for OCS for the Navy in the Reserves.

411
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,200
But I have a Dutch family that has been in the Navy in the Marine Corps.

412
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,920
So I guess you could say it's in my blood.

413
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,120
I very much like to help preserve my family's history.

414
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,260
And I feel some way with what I do with the Hornet, I help to play a role in preserving their stories.

415
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,120
Respected.

416
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:01,900
Respect.

417
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,460
I have one more question, and then we'll keep going.

418
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:13,160
Someone asked, was there ever a situation on the flight deck similar to the fire on the USS Forrestal?

419
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,560
So, no, there was not.

420
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:21,660
The Hornet actually had a great track record for its damage control and its safety over here.

421
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,620
Unfortunately, what happened with the Forrestal was a freak accident.

422
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,220
But the Hornet did not have any incidents of that happening.

423
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,740
Did we have some botched landings?

424
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,800
Of course we did.

425
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,000
Every carrier had that.

426
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,180
But we did not have a major fire.

427
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,180
Okay.

428
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:45,160
During 1944-45, there was a major typhoon that happened during the war.

429
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,120
Hornet noticeably had the front of its flight deck dented.

430
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:57,640
And you can find, if you Google it right now, Hornet flight deck dented, you will see an image of the USS Hornet's flight deck over the side of itself.

431
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,300
Because the typhoon crashed on the bow of the ship and crashed on the flight deck.

432
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,300
What?

433
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,360
I'm looking it up.

434
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:06,860
Dented.

435
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,020
Matter of fact, you're probably wondering, hey, why is the flight deck bending?

436
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,140
Well, let's take a guess, Ms. Mitt.

437
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,760
What do you think the flight deck is made of?

438
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,920
Made of?

439
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,560
What's it made of?

440
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,300
Metal.

441
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,660
Wrong.

442
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,020
Wrong?

443
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,360
What's it made of?

444
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:29,800
Wood.

445
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,640
Wood?

446
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,700
Made out of teak.

447
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:34,800
What?

448
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,180
During the war, the Navy wanted to produce ships fast.

449
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,920
And the idea was, they're not going to be in harm's way.

450
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,220
They're not going to be like battleships and taking shells.

451
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,640
So we don't need to armor our flight decks.

452
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,280
So we weren't like the British that thought, oh, we're taking so many hits, we need to make our decks out of steel.

453
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,540
The X-class carriers have teak decks.

454
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,340
It was only the midway class that got upgraded to have armored flight decks.

455
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,160
Whoa.

456
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,880
Most people don't know that.

457
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:08,200
Yeah, I just saw, I see the deck is bent like 90 degrees.

458
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,840
It's crazy.

459
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,280
There you see, that's what happened when the typhoon happened.

460
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:13,940
Wow.

461
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,920
This is one of my favorite aircraft right here.

462
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,740
The A-4 Skyhawk.

463
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,140
Now, this is a training variant of the A-4 Skyhawk, but it'll get the point across too.

464
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,520
You're probably wondering what this long tip pole is.

465
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:29,960
Yeah.

466
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,360
This is used for underwater, in-air refueling.

467
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:43,580
So if you search up in-air refueling, anybody at home, you'll usually large tanker aircraft, and this is normally what the Air Force does.

468
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,000
There's a large tanker aircraft that circle around in different areas of warfare.

469
00:26:50,140 --> 00:27:04,940
If aircraft need to do refueling, and they need to get back to their carriers, or they're on extended missions, and they may be running low, they're able to take this nozzle and connect it to a giant cone that helps to move it into position, and they can refuel while they're in the air.

470
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:11,670
This variant had this because they were training pilots to be able to do that.

471
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:16,690
So when they would go out to war, or they would go on sea, they would know how to do it properly.

472
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,790
But the A-1 Skyhawk, funny enough, it was actually used in Top Gun.

473
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,390
Not the movie, the program.

474
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,190
Top Gun is a program for the Navy's best pilot pilots.

475
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,830
If you've seen the movie, you understand, but there are some inaccuracies with that.

476
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,170
I love Top Gun!

477
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,130
We all love... hey, hey.

478
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,530
The need for speed.

479
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,110
What's Tom Cruise do?

480
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:43,490
He's like...

481
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,310
Goose!

482
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,510
Why is it such an accurate impression?

483
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,350
He's like, I gotta tell you, I love flying.

484
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,750
But the A-4 Skyhawk.

485
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,950
This aircraft was fast, light, and nimble.

486
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:17,330
Now, we actually have a docent here at the USS Hornet, Mr. Alan Cartwright, who flew over 400 combat missions in Vietnam in this aircraft.

487
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,070
Not this one specifically, but the A-4.

488
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,810
Mr. Cartwright is a great man.

489
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,070
If we see him around, I'll definitely introduce you.

490
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:31,110
But, the A-4 Skyhawk was fast and nimble, and it could imitate MiGs.

491
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:38,250
So, during the 60s, 70s, and 80s, they would use the A-4 as the adversary aircraft.

492
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:45,330
The adversary aircraft being when the pilots go out, so if you've seen Top Gun and they're in the F-14s and they go out, of course you're seeing the F-5s out there.

493
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:51,330
But, they would use this aircraft to be the aircraft that would dogfight against the pilots to test them.

494
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,650
Because they were faster, they were more maneuverable.

495
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:55,770
It was more of a challenge.

496
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,170
They needed to make their pilots more resilient in the face of adversity.

497
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,750
So, they put them at a disadvantage.

498
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,750
I know, I mean, that's how you get better, right?

499
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,030
Iron sharpens iron.

500
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,130
Here's the cool part about this aircraft.

501
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:14,630
So, it has a way of slowing itself down naturally.

502
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:18,530
No hydraulics, machinery, air pressure.

503
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,610
So, when it takes off on the carrier, and we'll go over how that works, too.

504
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,330
When it takes off on the carrier, it's pulled by the catapult and, shoom, launched.

505
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:37,310
When it's in the air and it has to build airspeed, on the wing and the stabilizer, as it goes faster and faster, it starts moving.

506
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:37,770
Whoa!

507
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,930
Until it comes to the lock position.

508
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,450
Now, Mr. Cameron, take a look here.

509
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,770
Look how much of a blade it is here.

510
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,810
Nice and nimble cut through the side.

511
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,250
Yeah!

512
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,570
You have very little drag.

513
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:00,570
You have air pocket around the aircraft as it flows through the air.

514
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,770
This helps it create more speed.

515
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:09,530
When it slows down, you start seeing this fall down.

516
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,650
Guess what this does?

517
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,550
Creates more drag.

518
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,050
It's a safer aircraft and helps land it smoother.

519
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,790
How heavy is that to push?

520
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:23,910
Well...

521
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,510
Oh, OK.

522
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,130
Onegai Muscle.

523
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,000
Onegai Muscle.

524
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,150
Anyways...

525
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,030
The A-4 was a great aircraft.

526
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,390
It was a workhorse of Vietnam.

527
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,990
Well, here, I'll show you how it did over here.

528
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:53,710
So, aircraft on aircraft carriers all have one distinct feature.

529
00:30:54,510 --> 00:31:01,210
They have a holdback bar and they have a resting gear.

530
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,110
This is called a tail hook.

531
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:10,430
You notice right here, this little groove right here.

532
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,330
You notice this little groove right here.

533
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,210
See how it curves in?

534
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:21,650
This is meant to catch a thick cable that is laying on the flight deck that is pulled by hydraulics on each side of the flight deck.

535
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:26,730
They adjust the tension for the weight of the aircraft, the speed of the aircraft, and what type of aircraft it is.

536
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:31,510
They adjust it so it catches right here and it helps to yank the aircraft back.

537
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,850
Here is a little question.

538
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:41,170
Do you think when an aircraft lands on an aircraft carrier, does it go full power or does it cut its power?

539
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,270
Cut its... Is this a trick question?

540
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,650
Full power then, right?

541
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,930
I don't know, Ms. Min.

542
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:51,850
Is it a trick question?

543
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,630
Full power!

544
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,550
That's what my chat said.

545
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,410
Let's give her her roses.

546
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,110
She's right.

547
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,450
Full power because you know why?

548
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:04,390
The hydraulic cable needs to adjust for the speed of the aircraft.

549
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,510
It needs to adjust it and pull it back.

550
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:10,050
And so when it goes full power, it can adjust properly.

551
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:17,310
Over here, you have this handy dandy tool.

552
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,330
Oh, it's locked.

553
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,270
This is a steel bar.

554
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:29,870
It weighs no more than about an ounce or two ounces depending on the size and weight of the aircraft.

555
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:35,170
Would you believe that when the aircraft is on the flight deck and it's getting ready to launch, it's going full power, right?

556
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,690
And there's a cable that holds it to an anchor point on the ground.

557
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,610
Would you believe this holds back this aircraft?

558
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,750
That thing, just that?

559
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:43,890
Yup.

560
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,050
Here's the cool part.

561
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,770
Right here, you see this little groove right here?

562
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:59,490
So each aircraft during the era, during the Cold War, had a holdback bar like this specifically designed for that aircraft.

563
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:14,810
This holdback bar, depending on the tension, depending on the aircraft and what they would adjust on the catapults down the catapult room, which we'll go see soon, they would adjust it and once, if they hit the launch button, the green shirts, once they hit the launch button,

564
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:15,750
ping.

565
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:22,650
It would separate, but it takes a specific amount of pressure and torque to be able to pull it apart.

566
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,110
Designed for this specific aircraft.

567
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:30,310
There are several like it, but none are, no single one works on multiple aircraft.

568
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,450
All custom made.

569
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:36,430
Now, in the Navy nowadays, they have a reusable one.

570
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,390
These were disposable.

571
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:42,990
Once they broke apart in single bars, they throw them over the side, but nowadays they have reusable ones that are recyclable.

572
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:46,250
They can retract and they are more modular for other aircraft.

573
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:57,510
Oh, I think I remember last time you showing the ones that were like, you talked about that too, when we were out on the flight deck and how they...

574
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,570
Yeah, I remember that.

575
00:33:59,390 --> 00:33:59,870
Yes, ma'am.

576
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,970
And that's just a closer look about how it works though, on an actual aircraft.

577
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:03,850
Yeah, yeah.

578
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,790
Here's a crazy thing.

579
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:07,650
It's a gift shop!

580
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:08,590
Gift shop!

581
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,570
I know, I know.

582
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,950
Let's take a look at this baby.

583
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,230
This is the S2 Tracker.

584
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,270
Who can guess what this aircraft was used for?

585
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,430
Who can guess, everybody?

586
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,130
Who can guess?

587
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,030
I'm looking at chat.

588
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,650
You get a cookie if you guess.

589
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,770
You get a cookie if you guess.

590
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,650
You get a cookie if you guess.

591
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:32,530
Someone said cargo?

592
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:33,670
Rescue?

593
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,270
It's not a chocolate chip cookie.

594
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,770
It's an oatmeal raisin, so it's kind of...

595
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,710
It's a cargo?

596
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,410
Someone said cargo, recon, rescue.

597
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:47,690
We got lots of people.

598
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:48,650
Bombs?

599
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,590
What else we got?

600
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:52,990
Assistance?

601
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:58,670
Well, chat, I hate to tell you, but none of you are right.

602
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:00,250
What is it?

603
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,810
This is used for anti-submarine warfare.

604
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:12,050
In the latter half of Hornet's history, she was designated a CVS.

605
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:18,650
Now, CV is a designation used to denote an aircraft carrier in all specifications.

606
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,350
So, there's CV 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

607
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,190
CV 12 is the 12th aircraft carrier.

608
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,070
So, CV aircraft carrier dash 12.

609
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,730
Aircraft carrier 12.

610
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,590
USS Hornet.

611
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:38,270
But, when they turned it into CVS, that meant the designation was anti-submarine warfare aircraft carrier.

612
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:46,010
So, the Hornet was complemented with multiple helicopters and aircraft that were meant to fight submarines.

613
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,170
To do recon.

614
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,570
To be able to find said submarines.

615
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,130
Yeah.

616
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,570
This aircraft...

617
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,850
This is probably one of the most interesting parts about it.

618
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:05,950
This aircraft could actually hold a torpedo and launch a submarine.

619
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,510
But, also, it could hold def charges, too.

620
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,850
You know what a def charge is, chat?

621
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,670
I don't know what a def charge is.

622
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:17,950
A def charge is a little device that's a bomb.

623
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,470
But, here's the thing.

624
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:27,490
Depending on when they use sonar, and they use sonar buoys, they can drop sonar buoys to be able to find submarines out in the ocean.

625
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:36,030
Depending on the def, the size, and where they need to drop the def charge, they can adjust it to feel pressure underwater.

626
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:40,250
If it reaches a certain pressure, then it, boom, blows up.

627
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,410
But, here's the thing.

628
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,650
It doesn't need to hit the actual submarine directly.

629
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,110
Anybody here drink soda?

630
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,170
Who drinks a soda can, right?

631
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,350
Like, Dr. Pepper, Sprite, you know, hey, so you want a Sprite cranberry?

632
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,110
It's the holidays, so you want a Sprite cranberry?

633
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:58,770
Oh, no, LeBron James is coming.

634
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,610
Anyways, you take a can, and you put it underwater.

635
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,350
What happens if you go in a pool with it?

636
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,170
And you go deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper.

637
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:08,990
Exactly.

638
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:11,830
It starts imploding.

639
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:12,930
It starts tightening up.

640
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:26,630
So, therefore, this aircraft drops the def charge, submarines underwater, drops the def charge, reaches a certain def, boom.

641
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,530
It causes a little dink to the submarine.

642
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:31,370
And you know what happens?

643
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,630
Submarines are pressurized.

644
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:33,730
So, here's what happens.

645
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,730
A little dink.

646
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,030
Teeny, tiny, little submarine.

647
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:38,890
Hand-holding.

648
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:40,550
Exactly.

649
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,430
Unwarranted hand-holding.

650
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,430
Unwarranted hand-holding.

651
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,890
I don't like that.

652
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:55,150
But the S2 Tracker was used for these things.

653
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,660
They had anti-submarine torpedoes.

654
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,970
They had those def charges.

655
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:04,630
It was dedicated during Vietnam to finding Russian submarines.

656
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:05,990
Did we find Russian submarines?

657
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,050
I couldn't tell you.

658
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,350
I don't know the answer to that.

659
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,550
But we were prepared in case of anything.

660
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,070
In case.

661
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,230
Any questions, chat?

662
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:17,970
Any questions?

663
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,350
Question, question.

664
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,170
Questions all?

665
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,050
I think we're good.

666
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:34,090
You guys stop asking weird stuff.

667
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,350
What are they asking?

668
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:37,950
They're asking if you work out.

669
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,130
Oh, you're keychain too.

670
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:42,250
I do a little cardio.

671
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:46,590
I do Zumba.

672
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,950
Wait, what about your keychain?

673
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,350
I think my mom's watching.

674
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,030
Hey mom, are we doing Zumba class on Tuesday?

675
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:59,290
Hey, if you can't do Zumba with your mama, you don't love your mama.

676
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,110
You gotta do Zumba.

677
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:02,970
You gotta do Zumba.

678
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,190
Exactly.

679
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,350
You gotta get right.

680
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,010
FJ-2 Fury.

681
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:11,670
So we talked about the advancement of aircraft and we showed some of the more advanced aircraft.

682
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:19,150
But this was actually one of the first aircraft to be post-propeller jet-propelled aircraft to grace the Navy.

683
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:23,410
FJ-2 Fury shares a similarity with a certain MiG, if you're familiar.

684
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,990
But this was one of the first aircraft to be vastly deployed in the fleet.

685
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:33,230
On the back over here, it says Marines.

686
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,270
Here's a little fun fact.

687
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:38,450
If any of you are Navy veterans, you'll probably get a kick out of this.

688
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,570
If the Navy doesn't want the aircraft, they give it to the Marine Corps.

689
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,170
It's an inside joke.

690
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:52,670
Sorry, I was copying and pasting a question so I can ask it later.

691
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,270
I can ask it now, it's okay.

692
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:57,430
We're doing copypastas and we're on a tour.

693
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,690
It's questions for you!

694
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,690
Hey, did you know that in terms of human anatomy...

695
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:05,950
Shut up!

696
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,580
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry.

697
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,440
The fitness gram test is an aerobic exercise.

698
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,820
Oh my god.

699
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:22,000
Anyway, if there's any more questions on the aircraft on this deck, we're going to head down below.

700
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,540
Any questions?

701
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,400
We'll head over there.

702
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:23,400
Oh no,

703
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:35,120
the little decontamination thing is behind the curtain, isn't it?

704
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,020
Oh, yeah it is, unfortunately.

705
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:37,860
Sorry guys.

706
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,120
But, we do have more exhibits down below.

707
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:41,800
Is that okay?

708
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,780
Yeah!

709
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:51,830
Before we continue though, Miss Mint, would you like to say who this is?

710
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:53,650
Who what is?

711
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,690
Oh, the bell!

712
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,450
What is the bell's name?

713
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,630
Oh, you told me.

714
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:00,910
It's Beffrey.

715
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,370
It's like Jeffrey Jellyfish.

716
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,030
Hi Beffrey!

717
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:10,010
I was like, Befferson?

718
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,090
I was close.

719
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,270
Alright, we're going to head down below deck.

720
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,110
Below deck time!

721
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,030
Is Beffrey official?

722
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,670
Is that it's actual official name?

723
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,030
No, I just made it up.

724
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:31,370
Oh.

725
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,050
Hey, you gotta have some fun.

726
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,310
You could have lied.

727
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,570
You could have lied just now and said, yeah, that's it.

728
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,370
And then, when I visit...

729
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,370
Hey, listen, listen.

730
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,090
I'm not going to do that.

731
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:44,670
You know why?

732
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:45,950
Why?

733
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,450
Because it's all going to get aboard the USS Hornet.

734
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:55,010
Actually, before we go below deck, I'm going to show you one of the haunted areas.

735
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:56,790
Haunted!

736
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,130
You guys!

737
00:41:59,070 --> 00:41:59,570
My people.

738
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:03,390
Oh,

739
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:06,850
rocky.

740
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:12,550
Oh, spooky.

741
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:15,870
Oh no, the lights will flicker on and off.

742
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,850
Oh god.

743
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:28,090
I bet five ghosts have touched that fire extinguisher.

744
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:39,530
I get it.

745
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,590
Too spooky.

746
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,090
You're too scared.

747
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:46,590
I get it.

748
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,010
You're chicken.

749
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:47,750
Baby, baby.

750
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,540
To where?

751
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,820
Sorry, it cut out a little bit.

752
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,180
Where are we?

753
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,460
This is called the Fossil.

754
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,680
We may lose connection here.

755
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,800
But this is called the Fossil.

756
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,020
This is the anchor room.

757
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,500
See these giant chains over here?

758
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:16,920
Yeah.

759
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:16,960
Yeah.

760
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,940
Not picking that up.

761
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,300
Way too heavy.

762
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,400
I can do it.

763
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,900
Of course you could.

764
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,280
You know what?

765
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,900
Mint, give me your strength.

766
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,440
Yeah!

767
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:51,690
All upon the mints, and the ghosts, and the VTuber fans.

768
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,570
Give me your power!

769
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:09,150
But, funny enough, this room was not only just the anchor room where the sailors would retract and detract the anchor.

770
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,790
It was actually where the Marine Corps would work out.

771
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,370
So you're looking at the Marine Corps' gym.

772
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,050
They lifted these instead?

773
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:20,830
Hey, Marines, they're tough as nails.

774
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:21,590
So I wouldn't doubt.

775
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,070
Any questions about this room before we go?

776
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:27,950
No, I think we're good.

777
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,630
Or is there anybody in chat?

778
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,350
If there are, I'll just ask them.

779
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:37,330
Funny enough, this is a beautiful room.

780
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:39,930
Someone said, where are all the crayons?

781
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:45,750
We keep them below deck because we don't want them to find them and eat them.

782
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:52,070
This, right here, is the junior officer's berthing.

783
00:44:52,550 --> 00:45:01,290
If you were a commissioned officer, and you have a four-year degree, you go into OCS or went to Naval Academy, you get some of the best digs on campus here.

784
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:07,190
You've got drawers, you've got all these amenities, you've got more privacy, you have a private head and all that jazz.

785
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:10,330
But this is one of the most premium berthing areas on the ship.

786
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,650
Below deck, enlisted to sleep on racks.

787
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:15,290
Here, they've got mattresses, they've got all the nice digs.

788
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:18,130
And funny enough is, we actually still use this to this day.

789
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:24,230
Our overnight program, we have our live-aboard program, where people can come, take a tour of the ship, do a ghost tour, even.

790
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:27,650
They can stay on the ship, sleep overnight, and get fed.

791
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,650
You get to have a wholesaler experience.

792
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:30,250
What?

793
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:31,310
That's crazy!

794
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:34,070
The really world-class, great program.

795
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:38,410
Our head of education, Heidi, she runs a great overnight program.

796
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:39,730
Ghost tour.

797
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,900
I do have a ghost story, though.

798
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,960
Yeah?

799
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,660
Right, so, bear with me here, okay?

800
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,300
Okay.

801
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,400
So, one night...

802
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:02,900
One night, I was here at the ship, and I heard a...

803
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,560
...clawing...

804
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,320
...at the...

805
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,560
...on the pipes.

806
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:16,040
And then I heard the words, it's the lash-slinging, ash-stinging, ash-stinging slasher.

807
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,880
And then I lost my act.

808
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,180
Oh, too spooky for me!

809
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:28,020
It's the lash-slinging, ash-stinging, bash-stringing slasher.

810
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,040
The hash-slinging, crash-bringing...

811
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,820
Dash-stringing...

812
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,020
Yeah, three spooky, five me.

813
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:43,800
So true.

814
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,640
You're scaring my chat!

815
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,380
Let's calm down.

816
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:53,880
And then the worst part was when we had a ghost tour, and we said, hey, let's have a pizza party, and a certain bear showed up.

817
00:46:55,160 --> 00:47:00,720
Wow, you're getting all the heavy hitters.

818
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,560
It's not my fault that, for some reason, Freddy Fazbear showed up on the ship.

819
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,380
I bet you get good reverb when you do that.

820
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:17,260
How do you mean, Freddy?

821
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,380
He's like...

822
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,940
Oh, here's one of the many ship stores!

823
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:33,580
So, goods and services were very, very rare at sea, so you had your ship's officer stores here.

824
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:41,020
Designated officers could buy cigarettes, they could buy candy, they could buy coke, they could buy anything from several stores here on the ship.

825
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,440
As we go below deck, you'll see where we had the ice cream machine.

826
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:50,400
You'll also notice a lot of these red canisters around here.

827
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,160
These are for damage control, fire retardant.

828
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:02,580
So, we keep this below deck, so in case one area of the ship is on fire, or under attack, or we need damage control, we're able to move supplies quickly.

829
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,680
This is the part that's on fire.

830
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,420
If this part's on fire, we're sure in trouble, aren't we?

831
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,760
Alright, who's hungry?

832
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:15,980
I'm hungry!

833
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:16,360
Me!

834
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,400
Welcome to the officers' wardrobe.

835
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:32,580
Now, this area has been beautifully restored by our volunteers here, but if we were at sea, or if we were in port, this would be a five-star restaurant that the officers get to go to, including the captain.

836
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,720
You see white tablecloths, you see fine china, like we have over here.

837
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,900
You'll notice the fine china, that was huge.

838
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:54,680
Matter of fact, to this day on the ship, we host our own officers' tea ceremony, so one of the things you can do aboard the Hornet is experience a Navy officers' tea ceremony.

839
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,340
Yep, hosted by our CEO.

840
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,820
So, this room was where hopes and dreams went to die.

841
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:11,320
On account of that, ice cream in the Navy during World War II was a rare occurrence.

842
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:18,220
Now, in at port, all the officers bring their spouses, the captain comes aboard, and his wife comes aboard.

843
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:27,060
Officers in the Navy were trained that when a woman comes aboard, walks through this door here, all are to stand up at attention.

844
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:35,600
Especially the captain's wife, when she comes, she presents herself, and all the officers are at attention, and when she sits down, everybody sits down.

845
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,180
Respect for the captain's wife.

846
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,760
So, here's what happened.

847
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:49,360
The captain's wife got to decide one crucial thing, and this is where the hopes and dreams thing comes into play.

848
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,940
So, the Hornet had ice cream, right?

849
00:49:52,420 --> 00:50:03,160
So, aboard the ship, the captain's wife would decide the menu for the night, and the waiter on her would say, would you care for dessert, would you care for ice cream tonight?

850
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,340
If she said yes, everybody got to have ice cream, yay!

851
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,660
If she said no...

852
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,280
Nobody's having ice cream that night.

853
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:12,920
What?!

854
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,900
That's so messed up!

855
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,980
It's tradition, Ms. Smith.

856
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,040
We respect tradition here.

857
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:24,060
What if she's like, I'm lactose intolerant, oh no.

858
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,740
And guess what, then the whole ship's lactose intolerant.

859
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,360
We ain't having no cows here.

860
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,780
Oh my god!

861
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,600
I'm sorry, that's the worst tradition.

862
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,920
Yeah, not a lot of people in the Navy were keen on it.

863
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,000
Here's a great picture from our collection.

864
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,620
This is Hornet during the 40s, during World War II.

865
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:47,100
Notice how the front of the deck is open, you have anti-aircraft guns.

866
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:52,680
You have sailors, when they come into port, they're usually lining the deck, you see in the Navy all the time.

867
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:59,720
They man the deck, they line across the edge of it as they come into port, but you notice how this is open right here, right?

868
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,960
Fast forward about 30 years.

869
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,240
Closed up.

870
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,180
Storm bow.

871
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,820
Stopped water from coming into there.

872
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,580
This is where the fossil and the anchor is.

873
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:19,300
So that whole area we were where the anchor was, was open originally, but then it was closed up when Hornet got her 1950s retrofit.

874
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,560
Oh, why?

875
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,540
Did someone fall overboard?

876
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,600
No, ideally it was just expanding the technology at the time.

877
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,640
Hornet not only got her new bow, but aircraft carriers during World War II were straight deck.

878
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,580
Because propelled aircraft, they go forward, right?

879
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,020
And they can land, and they can land softer.

880
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,260
Jet aircraft need more room for air.

881
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:45,280
So, as we got catapults, but also we got an angled flight deck.

882
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:50,740
So you would have the straight deck, but then you would have a little mini side deck that would go over the side here.

883
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,880
Landing aircraft, landing on the side.

884
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:56,360
Aircraft taking off, take off forward aft.

885
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,460
Oh wait, no, forward.

886
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,080
So, that was during the retrofit.

887
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:05,620
Here's an example right here of when she was a straight deck carrier.

888
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,900
Remember how I told you the 96th Navy Doctrine is aircraft need to be stored on the flight deck?

889
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,920
They look like little Metal Gears!

890
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:14,860
Oh my god!

891
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:16,760
Exactly!

892
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,520
Wow, it looks like Metal Gear Red!

893
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:26,890
Here's the Hornet after the war.

894
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:27,750
Shortly after.

895
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:34,610
But if you want to see what the Hornet looks like now, from bird's eye view.

896
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:39,090
Remember how I mentioned the angled deck?

897
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,750
So, still have the straight deck for aircraft taking off.

898
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:43,270
This is where aircraft land.

899
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:44,470
Wow!

900
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:51,570
So, they're all kind of compact in there.

901
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:55,530
How do they take off?

902
00:52:56,070 --> 00:53:04,930
So, they would move the aircraft down to the hangar deck, but also they would move them behind over here when they're going into flight operations to be able to launch aircraft.

903
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,710
They would use the elevator.

904
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:08,070
So, you notice this is an elevator.

905
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:11,010
There's an elevator forward, there's an elevator over here.

906
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:12,670
We have three elevators on the Hornet.

907
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:17,190
That would bring aircraft up and down as we're getting ready to launch aircraft and prepare them for flight operations.

908
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,890
I have someone asking you a question.

909
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:24,190
They said, ask him what steak and lobster means.

910
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,170
Steak and lobster.

911
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:29,950
Isn't that what the Air Force enjoys?

912
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:34,400
Uh-oh.

913
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,560
Do we got some Air Force people here?

914
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,420
Man, you got all the great stuff, huh?

915
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:51,540
Hey, I'm not trying to cause a turf war here.

916
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,480
Hey, step off.

917
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,260
Here's the buffet table for the wardrobe.

918
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:03,940
That's what we know as the wardrobe.

919
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,820
Officers get some of the best steaks and some of the best food on the ship.

920
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,240
Oh, wow.

921
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,720
Wow, there's actually food in there.

922
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,160
Baked food.

923
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,480
Nah, it's real.

924
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,040
Okay.

925
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,100
Man, you're making me hungry.

926
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:20,980
Let's get lunch.

927
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,480
I like how everything is mint colored.

928
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:29,520
I could tell.

929
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,440
Thank you.

930
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,820
I feel like royalty.

931
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,400
Notice that Elander and Globe right there.

932
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,740
Right here.

933
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,600
This is the Marine Guard post.

934
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,020
Nobody gets to cross this line.

935
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,780
There will be a Marine Guard in here 24-7.

936
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,760
Nobody gets to enter this area unless otherwise authorized.

937
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,600
Right there, the general orders.

938
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,860
General orders to take charge of this post and all government property in view.

939
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:26,760
To walk my post in a military manner, keeping always on the alert and observing everything that takes place within sight or hearing.

940
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,200
To report all violations of orders I am instructed to enforce.

941
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,180
To repeat all calls from posts more distant from guardhouse than my own.

942
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,620
To quit my post only when properly relieved.

943
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,200
To receive, obey, and pass on any sentry who relieves me.

944
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:46,700
All orders from the commanding officer of the day, officers, non-commissioned officers of the Guard only.

945
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,480
To talk to no one except in the line of duty.

946
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,860
To give the alarm in case of fire or disorder.

947
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,020
To call the corporal of the Guard in any case not covered by instructions.

948
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,480
To salute all officers, colors, standards, not case.

949
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,340
To be especially watchful at night and during the time for challenging.

950
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:05,720
To challenge all persons who are near my post.

951
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,040
And to allow one person to pass without proper authority.

952
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:10,980
Yes, sir!

953
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,680
I'm not a Marine, but they would know how to do that probably.

954
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,180
Over here you have some of the M1 brands the Marine Corps would use.

955
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:26,220
But this Marine Station, nobody would pass by.

956
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:29,160
We would have the Marine on guard here in the cage at all times.

957
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,080
Wanna know why?

958
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,040
Because this is where we store the big boys.

959
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,380
What's dark?

960
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:46,950
Oh no!

961
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,120
What did you say?

962
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,380
Um...

963
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,620
I think those are...

964
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,200
Bombs?

965
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:21,100
Oh my god, the guy back there scared me.

966
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,320
This is a 6-inch battleship shell.

967
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,420
Now remember guys, I'm 6'5".

968
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,580
That's how big this is.

969
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:53,180
Oh my god, it's like a big baby.

970
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,240
Exactly.

971
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,720
You also have 2,000-pound bombs right here.

972
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,000
Drake, you also have training bombs.

973
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:08,740
These are practice bombs that the Navy would use to be able to train pilots out on their bombing runs.

974
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:16,480
But where we are is the armored compartment where the magazine is, all around us.

975
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:21,380
This railing system would hook bombs up to chains, move them up and down.

976
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,760
You have a bomb elevator there that will take them to the flight deck.

977
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,340
Also here is the hangar deck.

978
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:32,380
All of the weapons are stored down here when we take them to the flight deck because nothing is armed on the hangar deck.

979
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:35,100
It's low and simple on the flight deck.

980
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,880
When you load it up here, there's a giant wall right here.

981
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,060
Armor, of course.

982
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,560
Move it out of the way.

983
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:41,400
Move it up.

984
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:42,580
Load them up.

985
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,340
Rail system in there.

986
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:44,800
Wow.

987
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:50,200
Someone asked, are those 500-pound bombs World War II-era armor piercers?

988
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,040
No, they are not armor-piercing bombs.

989
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:55,680
They are firearms.

990
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,040
Oh,

991
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:02,270
here!

992
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:07,650
Here's a close-up of the practice bombs right here.

993
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:09,730
See some of the sand that's in here?

994
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:10,490
These are heavy.

995
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:17,610
They are meant to simulate actual weapons to give pilots a better idea of what the ordnance they're working with.

996
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:22,910
See right here?

997
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:24,990
You see some of the sand that they were packing in there?

998
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:25,690
Nice and tight?

999
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:28,990
Absolutely.

1000
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:31,410
We love sand.

1001
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:32,110
We eat sand.

1002
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:32,990
Well, I don't know.

1003
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:34,010
I don't really like sand.

1004
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:34,730
It's rough.

1005
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:35,330
It's gross.

1006
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:36,250
It's everywhere.

1007
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:37,490
Okay, okay, Anakin.

1008
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,350
I don't like sand!

1009
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:48,110
Here's another compartment.

1010
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:49,510
Here's another compartment.

1011
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:58,650
Here's a good example of how a bomb looks when it's dropping.

1012
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,170
It's a 1,000-pound bomb.

1013
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:08,210
It has its guidance flaps there that help to circle it around to be able to make it reach its target as projected.

1014
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:10,370
Some have laser guidance.

1015
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:13,410
Here's actually a .50 cal.

1016
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:16,390
Wow, cool!

1017
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:18,570
Big shell.

1018
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:20,810
Here's some of the shells that you would see.

1019
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:22,090
40mm ammunition.

1020
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:24,410
Oh my god.

1021
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:26,710
That's long.

1022
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:32,650
Any questions from the crew?

1023
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:34,390
Any questions, anybody?

1024
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:37,410
Any questions?

1025
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,670
Oh, you said big shell.

1026
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:40,270
Sorry, that was a Metal Gear reference.

1027
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:42,250
Of course.

1028
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:44,330
This is a Metal Gear stream.

1029
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:44,950
Come on, man.

1030
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:49,950
Listen, listen, nanomachines, son.

1031
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:50,950
You gotta love them.

1032
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:53,710
Let's see.

1033
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:57,430
Hey, folks, I want to introduce you to my friend here.

1034
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:59,170
This is Steve Lutell.

1035
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:01,030
He's a U.S.S.R.C.

1036
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:04,730
What did you do in the world's greatest branch of military?

1037
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:07,990
I was a plane captain in the Marine Corps.

1038
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:09,550
Wow!

1039
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:11,230
How did you learn all of that?

1040
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:11,790
Come on!

1041
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:15,770
Well, plane captains are responsible for an airplane.

1042
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:18,690
The plane belongs to them, not to a pilot.

1043
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:20,710
That's a misconception people have.

1044
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:24,190
They don't get to fly the plane, but the plane belongs to them.

1045
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:28,490
So they have the plane ready for whoever will show up to fly the plane.

1046
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:31,430
So don't get misdirected by names on airplanes.

1047
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:34,570
That's just a plane that happens to have a pilot's name on it.

1048
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:36,370
That's what I would do.

1049
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:39,330
Help them, answer any of their questions, put them in the cockpit.

1050
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:42,470
The last thing I'd say, have a nice flight.

1051
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:44,910
Bring my machine back in one piece.

1052
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:46,050
Sir.

1053
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:49,530
If it says sir afterwards, I can get over it.

1054
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:50,370
Of course.

1055
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:51,750
I love Steve.

1056
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:56,170
He's actually endorsing the training when I first came aboard ship as a volunteer back a couple years ago.

1057
01:01:56,530 --> 01:01:58,670
So Steve, thank you for helping me aboard.

1058
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:00,490
Hey, go Bears.

1059
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:01,170
Go Bears.

1060
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:04,330
Nice to meet you, Steve.

1061
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:06,790
Bye, Daniel.

1062
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:11,270
Alright, where are we right now?

1063
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:13,070
Well, we're going down into the bow.

1064
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:14,250
Oh, no.

1065
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:15,390
The chain.

1066
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:16,950
Bring it closer to the camera.

1067
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:18,690
Oh, no.

1068
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:23,690
We're going deep into the bow of the ship.

1069
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:25,610
Ooh.

1070
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:32,750
Where we're going is the bread and butter of what makes a carrier an operator.

1071
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:39,790
Ooh.

1072
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:41,950
Little knobs.

1073
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:43,710
Welcome to the catwalk room.

1074
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:53,290
Where you are standing, where you're standing right now is the giant hydraulic piston to help launch the aircraft forward.

1075
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:57,250
Alright, who wants a drink?

1076
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:58,250
We've got whiskey.

1077
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:00,990
We've got rum.

1078
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:01,810
We've got gin.

1079
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:02,750
We've got beer.

1080
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:05,330
This is not a drinking stream.

1081
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:06,610
We're not doing that here.

1082
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:07,850
Hydraulic fluid.

1083
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:09,690
We just make fun of it.

1084
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:15,650
So, you have the hydraulic fluid, and you would mix it in, and you pump it into this baby.

1085
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:17,110
This is the pork cat.

1086
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:18,010
Cat!

1087
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:18,970
Cute!

1088
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:22,430
We like the pork cat.

1089
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:28,530
But you notice the giant cables that get the rocks retracted.

1090
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:30,710
This pulls the piston back.

1091
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:35,070
When we're in flight operation, this room is really, really light.

1092
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:36,970
I bet, yeah.

1093
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:40,610
Here's a general idea of how the catwalk room works.

1094
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:44,370
You have the hydraulic room here, and you notice how it's back over here.

1095
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:46,470
Well, that's because all the tension is pulled back.

1096
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:47,410
Pistons pull back.

1097
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:51,590
As the aircraft is launched, we get a full view of it.

1098
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:56,030
Pumping it full of hydraulic fluid to power the hydraulic cat.

1099
01:03:58,430 --> 01:03:59,130
Pulls it.

1100
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:03,730
There's the cable that Pamela Smith, last time we talked about how the aircraft would pull down the flight deck.

1101
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:04,890
Pulls it.

1102
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,910
You're seeing how that works underground.

1103
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,990
It's connected, but through multiple decks.

1104
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:12,490
Pulls the cable, helping to launch the aircraft.

1105
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:21,610
And then when it's done, they retract it, building more tension on the catapult, resetting it for another launch.

1106
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:23,670
And they can do that in about five minutes.

1107
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:26,650
They can get several aircraft in the air in about five minutes.

1108
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:28,050
That's insane.

1109
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:31,250
But you can fire it down here.

1110
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:33,450
So let's say we're up in the flight deck.

1111
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:36,010
They give me a signal.

1112
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:37,630
Matter of fact, there's a light right here.

1113
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:39,850
First ready.

1114
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:42,490
Fire the tension.

1115
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:44,530
The light's not working.

1116
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:45,210
Anyways.

1117
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:47,910
But, first ready.

1118
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:49,730
Put it on standby for green.

1119
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:50,890
Green means we're ready.

1120
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:52,430
Final ready means we can fire.

1121
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:53,750
Here's the big red fire button.

1122
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:54,530
Do I press it?

1123
01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:57,310
Press it!

1124
01:04:58,450 --> 01:04:58,970
Fire!

1125
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:02,830
And we launch an aircraft.

1126
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:08,550
Someone asked or said they heard that modern cats use steam.

1127
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:10,150
Do you know anything about that?

1128
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:12,990
Yes, modern cats use steam.

1129
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:15,490
But the most modern cats aren't using steam.

1130
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:17,130
They're using electromagnetics.

1131
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:18,890
Modern carriers, Gerald R.

1132
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:27,490
Ford class, are using electromagnetic catapults, which is the streamlined and newest way to be able to launch aircraft effectively and without putting as much strain on the catapults.

1133
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:30,470
Steam creates strain and hydraulics even more.

1134
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:36,330
They moved from hydraulics into steam and they've been using that for a couple of decades now.

1135
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:38,150
But now they've moved on into the future.

1136
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:39,190
Oh dang.

1137
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:41,030
We're past steam.

1138
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:43,150
We don't need that.

1139
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:44,390
We don't need water.

1140
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:44,590
Right.

1141
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:45,850
Vapor.

1142
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:46,570
Here we go.

1143
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,330
So take a look here a little closer.

1144
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:52,350
Here's the giant piston I told you about.

1145
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:52,990
Wow!

1146
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:57,830
This room is extremely loud when it fires forward.

1147
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:01,750
How many people are losing their hearing?

1148
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:07,550
Well, the Navy was not adamant about supplying earplugs.

1149
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:10,630
So that's why your grandpa can't hear you guys.

1150
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:15,190
Any questions about this room before we move on?

1151
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:17,210
Any other questions?

1152
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:19,490
I see someone said, did the ship have any battery?

1153
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:22,290
No, it did not.

1154
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:24,670
It's on a generator and power plant.

1155
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:25,730
Wow.

1156
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:34,090
Any other questions, comments, concerns?

1157
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:38,200
Someone asked, did you ever try any MREs?

1158
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:47,180
When I first came aboard and I was volunteering as a docent, they gave me an MRE and said, oh, it just tastes like chicken.

1159
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,440
Well, it didn't taste like chicken.

1160
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,200
It tasted like...

1161
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:54,980
Anyways.

1162
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,380
I think that's all we need to know.

1163
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,920
That's all you need to know.

1164
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,740
Alright, now it's going up.

1165
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:05,880
Be careful.

1166
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:07,380
Watch your step.

1167
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:15,060
This meant I've hit my head a great many times, and because I've done so, I haven't forgotten it.

1168
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,220
So, I think I've learned my lesson.

1169
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:22,670
Trust me.

1170
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:29,030
I'm 6'5", and Mr. Caribbean here is about the average height of a World War II sailor.

1171
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:31,130
I'm usually in trouble.

1172
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:33,130
That's why my hat right here, I got a lot of marks.

1173
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:36,150
How tall are you again?

1174
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:36,970
I don't think I know.

1175
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:38,750
6'5", man.

1176
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:43,870
Alright.

1177
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,180
We got a little beaver in here.

1178
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,940
Oh, they shut off the lights, but I want to see the ice cream shop.

1179
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,080
Crackers.

1180
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:55,200
Where's crackers?

1181
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:00,980
That's another one of the stores that officers can go buy goodies at.

1182
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:01,720
Oh.

1183
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:08,990
Oh my god, watch your head.

1184
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:17,250
Yeah,

1185
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:24,990
this does look like a horror movie, right?

1186
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:28,490
Hey, you're the ghost seat here.

1187
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:29,910
I figured you'd be right at home.

1188
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:30,870
Yeah, I am.

1189
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:35,470
Someone asked if they have an NBC display.

1190
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:38,670
NBC display.

1191
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:41,550
I'm not bringing it down.

1192
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:46,950
Could that person ask for a report site?

1193
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:48,990
Does this look more industrial?

1194
01:08:58,690 --> 01:09:00,110
Well, I can't find the light switch.

1195
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:02,650
Anyways, we just got to the ice cream shop.

1196
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:03,650
What?

1197
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:04,970
That was the ice cream!

1198
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:07,990
Well, here, I have the flashlight.

1199
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:11,070
We got to see the ice cream.

1200
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:15,290
You know what?

1201
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:16,870
Let's see if you have a sweet tooth.

1202
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:20,530
I mean... nah.

1203
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:25,190
Anyways, this is called the G-Dunk.

1204
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:30,630
Get your orange juice, milk, coffee, cola, root beer, hot dog, hamburger, spam sandwich.

1205
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:32,410
Yes, they would make sandwiches out of spam.

1206
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:33,530
Hot dogs!

1207
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:37,270
Ice cream and milkshake too.

1208
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:38,450
Strawberry, chocolate, vanilla.

1209
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,230
The G-Dunk.

1210
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:45,170
The G-Dunk was a premium spot where you could go get some ice cream.

1211
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:47,130
Oh, here's actually the lights.

1212
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:48,110
Yay!

1213
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:50,250
See, this is why we go check.

1214
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:55,130
But you'll notice some of the prices here.

1215
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:56,250
Orange juice, 10 cents.

1216
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:57,390
Milk, 10 cents.

1217
01:09:57,490 --> 01:09:58,310
Coffee, 10 cents.

1218
01:09:58,430 --> 01:09:59,550
Coca-Cola, 10 cents.

1219
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:00,430
Root beer, 10 cents.

1220
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,670
Hot dog, 15 cents.

1221
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:02,910
Hamburger, 25.

1222
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:05,110
With cheese, Mr. Squidward.

1223
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:05,970
With cheese.

1224
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:13,990
Spam sandwich, 20 cents.

1225
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:16,350
With cheese, Mr. Squidward.

1226
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:17,050
With cheese.

1227
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:19,550
In-bar, 10 cents.

1228
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,190
Root beer, float, 20 cents.

1229
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:22,590
Ice cream, 10 cents.

1230
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:24,110
Milkshake, 20 cents.

1231
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:25,830
Milkshake, 20 cents.

1232
01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:26,590
Sheesh.

1233
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:31,950
Can you imagine that now, back in the day, for only 10 cents, you could get all that.

1234
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:33,450
For a dollar.

1235
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:34,950
Imagine what you could get for a dollar.

1236
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:35,530
Gosh.

1237
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:37,870
I'd give it a buck fifty.

1238
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:43,810
I feel like the Spam sandwich is... shouldn't that be the cheaper option?

1239
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:48,750
It should be the cheaper option, but Spam was more rare back then, especially at sea.

1240
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:52,610
Easier to get beef than it was Spam.

1241
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:59,190
We're not done yet, so let's keep going.

1242
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:00,330
Yippee!

1243
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:06,370
We're over here, so if I go through this way, I should take that step.

1244
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:15,390
We're heading to the next step now.

1245
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:29,450
And if they're left there, be light.

1246
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:29,710
Yes.

1247
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:35,390
It feels like we're trespassing.

1248
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:39,550
I know we're not, but because you're having to turn on the lights, all the lights are off.

1249
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:44,210
So normally, I would take you down to see the interim to see the Horace PowerPoint.

1250
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:49,730
But, we will lose Wi-Fi connection, so unfortunately, I can't take you down there.

1251
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:58,370
But, for any of the viewers at home, if you are interested in seeing the interim, we do have daily docent tours that go on, and take you in-depth into the interim with a certified docent.

1252
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:00,330
Dang.

1253
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:04,290
Ok, well you guys just go and video it for me or something.

1254
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:11,310
Alright, we'll go to the next step.

1255
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:13,830
Usually when it's chow time, chow time.

1256
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:16,070
Long line right here.

1257
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:16,990
Every sailor is hungry.

1258
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:18,470
Time for my kids to eat.

1259
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:23,650
Over here is actually the menu shop.

1260
01:12:24,350 --> 01:12:26,910
So right next to where you eat, is where it's located.

1261
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:29,330
Basically, this is at Sea Home Depot, right here.

1262
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:31,310
It looks like it.

1263
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:36,690
They would repair... we actually still use it today to repair the equipment we have here on the ship.

1264
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:37,270
Oh, wow.

1265
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:39,490
So it's like fully operatable still?

1266
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:41,090
Yes, ma'am.

1267
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:42,090
Thanks for our volunteers.

1268
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:44,510
Thanks, volunteers.

1269
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:47,750
Got your lunch tray.

1270
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:49,010
Grab it right here.

1271
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:51,890
Your lockers have to be nice and ready for the next round.

1272
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:53,070
Wow.

1273
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:53,670
Wow.

1274
01:12:57,650 --> 01:13:00,090
But, over here you got your line, got your chow hall.

1275
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:01,970
This is the enlisted mess deck.

1276
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:03,410
This is where the officers go in.

1277
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:04,850
Enlisted line up here.

1278
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:06,430
They're with the premium stuff.

1279
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,790
What kind of stuff would you get here?

1280
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:14,430
You get eggs, toast, maybe bacon if you're lucky.

1281
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:15,070
Lucky.

1282
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:16,370
Lucky day.

1283
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:19,010
Here, I'll tell you.

1284
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:20,150
Just start on the galley light.

1285
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:20,910
Let's take a look in here.

1286
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:22,230
Look how big that kitchen is.

1287
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:23,870
Oh, wow.

1288
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:29,280
We have to cook for over 4,000 sailors.

1289
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,540
Yeah, you have to be ready.

1290
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:32,500
Oh, my God.

1291
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:39,110
Yeah, that, that... Oh, my God.

1292
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:40,890
The big, like, tins on the side.

1293
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:41,910
That's crazy.

1294
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:47,790
Back over here.

1295
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:48,450
Yummy.

1296
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:50,690
Here's the mess deck.

1297
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:52,150
Mess deck.

1298
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:56,350
This is where we go eat.

1299
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:58,690
We got our buffet tables.

1300
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:00,690
We still keep here for when we do overnights.

1301
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:02,210
And we serve people aboard the ship.

1302
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:06,290
But we use this area for overnight programs.

1303
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:07,690
People are able to sit down.

1304
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:10,630
But also, this is where the enlisted hall mess deck was.

1305
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:14,930
Usually, you have a couple thousand sailors in at a time.

1306
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:19,330
Yeah, looks like a little place to eat.

1307
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:23,830
Yeah, it's not as nice as the officer one.

1308
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:26,850
It looks very clean for being called a mess deck.

1309
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:32,390
Oh, no.

1310
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:52,950
I probably shouldn't go near an oven.

1311
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:56,010
Okay, then you do not like to bake.

1312
01:14:57,170 --> 01:14:58,930
Well, we're going to take you near an oven anyways.

1313
01:14:59,030 --> 01:14:59,910
Because here's the bakery.

1314
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:01,850
Yay, the bakery.

1315
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:06,730
You will make all sorts of pastry.

1316
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:10,310
They actually would make cakes in here for the officer for different ceremonies.

1317
01:15:10,730 --> 01:15:13,050
Right here, we actually have a nice little recipe.

1318
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:15,610
So, anybody who wants a screenshot, try it for yourself.

1319
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:18,790
You got Hornet Cake Donuts.

1320
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:20,610
Well, that sounds awesome, actually.

1321
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:21,770
Wait, I'm screenshotting it.

1322
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:24,230
Wait, that sounds awesome.

1323
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:25,950
I'm not in the way, right guys?

1324
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:26,370
Okay, good.

1325
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:28,150
There you go.

1326
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:29,310
Make your cake donuts.

1327
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:34,290
I know, I have a few people in chat that will tell me what they're making.

1328
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:37,130
So, you guys better make this and let me know how it is.

1329
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:42,670
Well, they would provide pastries for all the ships making bread.

1330
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:44,090
One o'clock.

1331
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:46,790
Got your master's ovens right here.

1332
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:48,150
Making dough.

1333
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:49,330
Store to board.

1334
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:50,970
All done.

1335
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:51,590
On ship.

1336
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:53,950
Making bread, eh?

1337
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:54,910
The bakery.

1338
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:57,110
Hey, we gotta get our bread, you know?

1339
01:15:57,170 --> 01:15:58,150
We gotta get the bread.

1340
01:15:58,490 --> 01:15:59,090
Oh, yeah.

1341
01:16:00,410 --> 01:16:01,590
You know what I'm saying?

1342
01:16:01,730 --> 01:16:02,330
You know what I'm saying?

1343
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:02,790
You know what I'm saying?

1344
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:04,050
We gotta get the bread, you know?

1345
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:08,070
Hustling.

1346
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,090
Trying to get the bread.

1347
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:09,830
The bread.

1348
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:10,810
Make that bread.

1349
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:13,810
Gotta make the cake.

1350
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:18,290
Did that shut off?

1351
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:19,470
No, that did not shut off.

1352
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:21,050
There we go.

1353
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:22,030
There you go.

1354
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:25,250
Okay, let's go back.

1355
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,470
Are there any questions I can answer?

1356
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:29,710
Any questions?

1357
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:31,170
Anybody?

1358
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:31,970
Anything?

1359
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:35,310
Oh, someone asked if he believes...

1360
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:36,490
Do ships have souls?

1361
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:37,890
Do you believe if ships have souls?

1362
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:41,270
I believe every ship has a soul.

1363
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:42,870
And I'm gonna get sappy here for a second.

1364
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:43,890
Because you know why?

1365
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:51,630
Because these ships represent the history of many young men and women who served so that we could be able to do what we do today.

1366
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:57,710
And I believe that though they have passed on, their history and their souls and their stories still live on through the Hornet.

1367
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:03,970
And that's the beautiful part about what we do here is that we help to preserve their story and tell you guys who don't know anything about that.

1368
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:05,750
So, do I believe ships have souls?

1369
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:06,990
100% I do.

1370
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:07,810
There you go.

1371
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:10,110
I respect it.

1372
01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:14,950
I mean I am a soul.

1373
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:18,950
What's the Spongebob meme?

1374
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:19,850
I have no soul.

1375
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:23,110
I don't think I know that one.

1376
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:28,750
It's the episode where Squidward tries to grab you Patty.

1377
01:17:29,230 --> 01:17:30,990
And Squidward is like, oh it's good for your soul.

1378
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:31,890
And he's like, oh please.

1379
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:32,710
Oh yeah!

1380
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:33,770
That's right!

1381
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:40,390
Someone asked in the bakery, how many crew would end up getting a birthday cake?

1382
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:42,830
Not many.

1383
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:43,230
Really?

1384
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:48,550
When they made cakes, it was either the captain's birthday or if the Admiral was born, they'd make the cake to celebrate special occasions.

1385
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:55,090
I feel like they should have at least done one a month, you know, for everybody who was in that month.

1386
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:56,630
Oh, 4,000?

1387
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:57,450
Yeah.

1388
01:17:59,430 --> 01:18:00,830
Man, that sure is a treat.

1389
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:05,050
If I were captain, everybody would get cake.

1390
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,770
Oh no!

1391
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:11,630
Mutiny!

1392
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:13,190
I'm overthrowing this ship!

1393
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,020
Watch your step.

1394
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:39,480
This is the office for Central.

1395
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:44,220
And to this day, it's actually behind the scenes book at our admin area.

1396
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:51,720
This is where a lot of our offices are, a lot of our head admins are, where they do their business.

1397
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,580
But traditionally, this is where the Navy would be cabled.

1398
01:18:57,450 --> 01:19:00,050
Is your neck okay, Havenda?

1399
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:04,290
I've done this for quite a while, trust me.

1400
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:05,790
I'm taking it out.

1401
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:06,150
I'm good.

1402
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,380
Oh, they shut off the lights.

1403
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:11,660
Okay.

1404
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:15,720
Alright.

1405
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:18,080
This is the horror tour.

1406
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:22,860
Hey, you wanted the spooky, I brought you the spooky.

1407
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:24,400
Thank you.

1408
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,720
Oh, I look so spooky.

1409
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:26,600
Oh my gosh.

1410
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:33,670
You like Top Gun, right?

1411
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:35,450
Wait, hold on.

1412
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:36,990
I think... Oh, the Wi-Fi is catching up.

1413
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:37,430
There we go.

1414
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:39,510
Okay.

1415
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:41,330
You like Top Gun, right?

1416
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:45,170
You like Top Gun, right?

1417
01:19:45,630 --> 01:19:46,710
Yeah, I love Top Gun.

1418
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:49,190
This room look familiar?

1419
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:55,000
Oh, it's loading.

1420
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:55,440
Hold on.

1421
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:01,450
Oh God.

1422
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:08,790
I think... Yeah, I think the Wi-Fi is a little... It's denying me.

1423
01:20:08,810 --> 01:20:10,210
It looks like... Yeah, the briefing room.

1424
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:13,070
It is the briefing room.

1425
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:14,230
This is ready room four.

1426
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:19,870
This is where pilots would be ready and get mission briefings before they would be headed out to their flight operations.

1427
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:26,830
Like you saw in the movie in Top Gun, this is where they are with their chairs and their desks.

1428
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:29,310
And they got their... It's basically like school.

1429
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:32,150
Oh my God, the chairs look comfy.

1430
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:34,150
They are comfy.

1431
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:37,050
Those were donated many years ago to help restore the area.

1432
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:37,950
Oh, wow.

1433
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:39,650
Wait, so they weren't there before?

1434
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:43,070
No, so something... And here's a fun fact.

1435
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:46,030
Well, not really a fun fact, but here's a fact for the crew at home.

1436
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:59,650
The Navy, when they give a museum ship, they do not give it as it really is because a lot of the equipment, whatever the guns or whatever the Navy can recycle for another ship, they take off the ship and or they destroy it.

1437
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:00,730
And they clean out the ship.

1438
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:03,830
So when we got the Hornet, she was cleaned out of all of her equipment.

1439
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:09,150
So everything you see here today is almost over 25 years of building the museum back.

1440
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:10,070
Wow.

1441
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:12,890
Again, volunteers, folks.

1442
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:14,850
Wow.

1443
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,790
Yeah, I guess that makes sense, though, to repurpose it or, you know.

1444
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,760
True, but it is sad because we're not able to teach the next generation about what it was like.

1445
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:32,120
All right, we'll keep moving on.

1446
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:33,920
We'll do our best.

1447
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:36,520
You're doing a great job.

1448
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,360
Welcome to... any Marines in the chat?

1449
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:41,780
Welcome to Marine Corps Central.

1450
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:42,360
Oh.

1451
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,280
Commanding officer's office here in the Marine Corps.

1452
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:55,460
Every Navy vessel has a Marine detachment because Marine Corps is actually an attachment, is actually a department of the Navy.

1453
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,580
Functions as its own branch of the military, but it does go in tandem with the Navy.

1454
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:01,540
Navy gets you there.

1455
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:04,100
So that's one of the offices you see here, Wakanda.

1456
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:05,360
Oh.

1457
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:09,660
This is one of the cleanest bathrooms you will ever see on the Hornet.

1458
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:12,560
This...

1459
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:16,140
I don't think the Wi-Fi likes the bathroom.

1460
01:22:24,090 --> 01:22:27,010
I don't think the Wi-Fi likes the bathroom, you guys.

1461
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,200
All right.

1462
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:41,320
We get denied the bathroom.

1463
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:45,720
What?

1464
01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:57,150
It'll pick up, I think.

1465
01:22:57,670 --> 01:22:59,030
It'll pick up, you guys, don't worry.

1466
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:03,070
Show us the poop deck.

1467
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:07,210
We're in the spooky part.

1468
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:09,650
The ghosts need the Wi-Fi.

1469
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:11,010
A.K.A.

1470
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:12,670
I mean...

1471
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,620
I hope you guys are enjoying the tour so far.

1472
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,580
It'll come back.

1473
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,280
It'll come back, right?

1474
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,480
Tell the ghost to stop downloading.

1475
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,320
It'll come back, right?

1476
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:41,540
Eventually.

1477
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,660
Hold on, let me see.

1478
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:51,240
Oh no!

1479
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:53,520
We lost him!

1480
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:54,700
Oh no!

1481
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:55,740
We lost him!

1482
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,400
Oh no!

1483
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:00,240
Maybe I should...

1484
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:02,440
Oh no!

1485
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:08,240
Yeah, we're back!

1486
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:11,180
Sorry!

1487
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:16,280
Yes.

1488
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:26,300
Let's go up there.

1489
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:39,180
There we go.

1490
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,440
We're back here.

1491
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:43,800
OK.

1492
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:44,360
OK.

1493
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:00,010
I'm sorry!

1494
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:06,310
OK.

1495
01:25:10,290 --> 01:25:11,950
Guys, any questions?

1496
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:12,810
Questions, questions?

1497
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:14,870
Are we allowed to go outside or no?

1498
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:17,250
Is it off because of the event?

1499
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:20,210
We actually can go up to the flight deck.

1500
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:22,750
I want to make sure we have Wi-Fi first.

1501
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:24,470
Oh yeah, I know it's a little iffy out there.

1502
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:28,190
Well, we can give it a shot.

1503
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:31,050
Someone asked, what's your favorite part of the job?

1504
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:40,630
Favorite part of the job is helping people who don't know about the Hornet discover the Hornet.

1505
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:46,950
Because when I first started, when I became a volunteer, before I even became a volunteer, I didn't know the Hornet was still around.

1506
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:49,490
I didn't know a piece of World War II history was still here.

1507
01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:58,150
And I would say what I get the most fulfillment out of is just connecting people with this place and helping them to know that it's more than just a military museum.

1508
01:25:58,270 --> 01:25:59,410
It's a sea, air, and space museum.

1509
01:25:59,570 --> 01:26:00,650
It's a pillar of the community.

1510
01:26:01,050 --> 01:26:06,850
And especially what we do for the community of the Bay Area, especially the educational programs we have for the youth.

1511
01:26:06,850 --> 01:26:14,910
It's really great to see how the Hornet, we are able to use our collections to be able to inspire the next generation of innovators, as well as STEM majors.

1512
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:18,250
Yeah, it's really cool.

1513
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:20,970
That's probably my favorite job, is teaching guys like me.

1514
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:27,890
Oh, they asked earlier about your keychains on your...

1515
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:30,490
Why doesn't everyone notice the keychains?

1516
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:34,370
Okay, Mr. Cameraman, you don't have to do that.

1517
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:39,690
All right, so these are VTubers that I have a connection with.

1518
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:42,090
So this is Fumo Goro-Goro.

1519
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:43,890
She is a friend of mine.

1520
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:46,030
I met her a while back ago.

1521
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:46,750
She's great.

1522
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:48,550
She's a big fan of the USS Iowa.

1523
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:50,730
Can't speak of praises enough.

1524
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:58,350
And funny enough is these are VTubers that I actually work with because I actually run a VTuber group called V Fleet Project.

1525
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:01,450
This is our USS Hornet, CV.

1526
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:02,570
Cute!

1527
01:27:04,370 --> 01:27:08,590
This is our F-18 Super Hornet, because we have jet girls, not just ship girls.

1528
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:10,210
This is Faye 18.

1529
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:12,890
And she actually was in the concert with you, Miss May.

1530
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:13,190
Yeah!

1531
01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:17,430
And this is her little sister, Ami 35.

1532
01:27:18,210 --> 01:27:20,610
She's an F-35 Lightning II.

1533
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:22,390
I don't think she's a little sister.

1534
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:28,150
Yes.

1535
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:41,120
We broke him, you guys.

1536
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:50,960
Sorry.

1537
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:51,600
Sorry.

1538
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:52,180
Professional.

1539
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:53,360
Professional.

1540
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:53,920
Sorry.

1541
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:54,220
Ok.

1542
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:55,200
Ok.

1543
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:57,960
Let's go to the fight now.

1544
01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:05,670
Miss May, you are troubled.

1545
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:06,890
What?

1546
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:07,890
No.

1547
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:13,930
Oopsie.

1548
01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:24,530
I'm not in trouble.

1549
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:26,990
Are you guys ready for the best part of the tour?

1550
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:29,230
Best part!

1551
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:30,030
Best part!

1552
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:30,110
Alright.

1553
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:33,530
This is the best part.

1554
01:28:34,170 --> 01:28:35,490
Probably the most historical.

1555
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:36,850
The most thrilling.

1556
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:39,530
Hey, you guys need to hold on to your seat, ok?

1557
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:40,730
Hold on to your seat.

1558
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:40,850
Oh!

1559
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:41,890
I love this part!

1560
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:45,850
Take a swig of your gamer socks.

1561
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:47,730
Get ready.

1562
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:48,610
We're about to go.

1563
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:48,910
Ready?

1564
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:49,670
Oh my god.

1565
01:28:49,710 --> 01:28:50,630
I love this part actually.

1566
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:51,630
Ok, you guys ready?

1567
01:28:52,150 --> 01:28:52,790
Are you ready for this?

1568
01:28:53,130 --> 01:28:53,630
Here it is.

1569
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:54,370
Here it is.

1570
01:28:54,450 --> 01:28:55,810
The Escalator!

1571
01:28:57,410 --> 01:28:57,590
Yeah!

1572
01:29:00,290 --> 01:29:01,090
Yippee!

1573
01:29:06,490 --> 01:29:09,090
Wow, it looks so crazy like this.

1574
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:15,620
It's the Escalator you guys!

1575
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:23,820
What a thrill.

1576
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,000
Oh it's night!

1577
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:39,100
Welcome to the flight deck.

1578
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:40,920
I didn't realize it would be so dark.

1579
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:50,500
But, we have one of the best views of San Francisco.

1580
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,400
Check out the horizon.

1581
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:55,980
That's San Francisco right over there.

1582
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,020
Oh my god!

1583
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:00,660
Wow, I didn't realize it would be so dark.

1584
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:11,460
Thanks to kind donors and viewers like you, the Hornet can be seen from San Francisco because we now have our own.

1585
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:13,220
Twelve!

1586
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:16,560
Oh my gosh!

1587
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:17,520
That's so cute!

1588
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:25,290
Twelve.

1589
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:28,090
Down this way is the F-14 Tomcat.

1590
01:30:28,570 --> 01:30:28,830
Yeah!

1591
01:30:29,950 --> 01:30:31,450
So we can try to go see it.

1592
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:32,490
Hopefully we'll have a connection.

1593
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:33,630
If we do, we'll go back.

1594
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:38,930
But this whole area would be busy during the entire time.

1595
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:41,210
Flight operations.

1596
01:30:41,630 --> 01:30:45,910
Nobody is supposed to be on the deck unless they are authorized and have a designated shirt.

1597
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:50,930
Mr. Steve, Mr. Steve told you he was a plane captain.

1598
01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:52,990
He would wear a brown shirt on a flight deck.

1599
01:30:54,110 --> 01:30:55,290
He owns the plane.

1600
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:57,850
He tells the pilot, hey, this is what you're doing.

1601
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:00,810
That's crazy.

1602
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:08,650
If you remember correctly, this is the catapult system, like riding a horse.

1603
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:09,210
Yes!

1604
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:15,990
So now you have actually seen the catapult down below.

1605
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:18,230
So you see how it works here?

1606
01:31:18,350 --> 01:31:20,590
This is connected to the hydraulic pistons down below.

1607
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:22,090
Wow.

1608
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:24,790
Shows the aircraft down.

1609
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:27,130
The big old piston.

1610
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:31,250
This is another anti-submarine warfare aircraft.

1611
01:31:41,290 --> 01:31:42,650
Any questions?

1612
01:31:43,810 --> 01:31:47,730
Someone said, ask about the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12.

1613
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:57,910
It was actually the aircraft carrier that picked up the astronauts, especially Apollo 11, with Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Mike Collins.

1614
01:31:57,910 --> 01:31:59,850
Picked them up back in 1969.

1615
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:08,190
We're losing Wi-Fi.

1616
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:09,170
Oh no!

1617
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:14,970
Return to...

1618
01:32:15,990 --> 01:32:16,530
Oh God.

1619
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:18,290
Return to the hangar.

1620
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:27,210
Sorry guys for the technical difficulties.

1621
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:35,200
Last time they took us on the deck and we were able to see quite a bit.

1622
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:40,380
But I think the Wi-Fi is not so kind today.

1623
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:50,290
Can you hear us?

1624
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:50,990
Yes!

1625
01:32:54,350 --> 01:32:54,990
Hello?

1626
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:06,720
Yeah.

1627
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:09,560
Everybody, 07.

1628
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:11,640
07.

1629
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:13,580
There we go.

1630
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:17,360
07 indeed.

1631
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:18,740
F in the chat.

1632
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:20,260
F in the chat, yeah.

1633
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:22,600
Respect.

1634
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:25,560
Anyway, we'll head down.

1635
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:27,580
But yeah, here's just a brief thing of the flight deck.

1636
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:29,100
If it was brighter we could see a little bit more.

1637
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:31,860
Great view of the tower, right?

1638
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:33,420
We call it the island.

1639
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:35,360
It's not the tower or the bridge.

1640
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:36,380
It's the island.

1641
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:37,100
The island.

1642
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:41,540
Wow.

1643
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,340
What's the green light up there for?

1644
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:46,340
Oh, that's just for... to make it look cool.

1645
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:47,020
Oh, okay.

1646
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:49,220
It's very seasonal.

1647
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:53,080
Hey, we get festive around here, right?

1648
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:59,460
Of course, Santa Claus is in an attack aircraft.

1649
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:01,880
We'll be ready for him.

1650
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,680
Are there any questions?

1651
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:07,800
Questions, you guys.

1652
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:09,000
Questions, any questions?

1653
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:10,080
Questions, questions.

1654
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,520
Oh, could be haunted, yeah.

1655
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:16,560
The ghost party is happening up there.

1656
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:20,180
Someone asked...

1657
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:23,860
Someone asked, what's your favorite aircraft that operated from the Hornet?

1658
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:25,260
Was it one of the ones you showed?

1659
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:29,180
Yes, so my favorite aircraft is the F-8 Crusader.

1660
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:32,560
Because, again, it did not use misguided...

1661
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,020
It was a gunfighter.

1662
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:36,940
And it was a one-on-one dogfight.

1663
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:38,900
That's crazy.

1664
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:42,880
Someone asked...

1665
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:43,580
Wait, what is this?

1666
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:50,040
Is it true that the slingshot operators wore red in case it snapped and hit them and unalived them?

1667
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:52,540
So, no, that is not true.

1668
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:55,480
So, catapult operators wore green.

1669
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:59,280
Green is the general color, but they're the main operators for that.

1670
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,320
Red works with ammunition.

1671
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:06,460
They're responsible for munitions, loading up aircraft.

1672
01:35:06,940 --> 01:35:12,100
Vertical is responsible for fueling ground and plane captains, like Steve, like you saw.

1673
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:13,320
And...

1674
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:18,760
Red feels appropriate for ammunition.

1675
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:33,600
There's actually a firefighting suit right here.

1676
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:39,440
Trendy.

1677
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,200
And so far, Apollo 11.

1678
01:35:47,470 --> 01:35:49,270
Apollo 11 flag right here.

1679
01:35:50,510 --> 01:35:51,010
Hornets emblem.

1680
01:35:52,590 --> 01:35:54,910
Oh my gosh, the cute little hornet!

1681
01:35:56,170 --> 01:36:00,270
And this is an officer's cutlass dress sword.

1682
01:36:00,730 --> 01:36:10,510
Now, there's actually an interesting video on our YouTube channel with our exhibits manager, who actually goes into depth about the history of the cutlass in the Navy, but also in other navies around the world.

1683
01:36:10,510 --> 01:36:12,830
So, you can actually find that on the USS Hornets YouTube channel.

1684
01:36:12,930 --> 01:36:13,630
Oh, cool!

1685
01:36:13,850 --> 01:36:15,090
I already heard that here, guys.

1686
01:36:17,370 --> 01:36:18,410
Study the blade.

1687
01:36:20,550 --> 01:36:24,290
The way the sword, like, right in my feets, that doesn't beat nanomachines.

1688
01:36:26,010 --> 01:36:26,290
Why?

1689
01:36:26,470 --> 01:36:27,950
Not that you know, you know.

1690
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:30,370
Hey, I used to play college ball.

1691
01:36:34,050 --> 01:36:35,470
A tool of justice.

1692
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:38,950
Listen, Senator Armstrong.

1693
01:36:39,450 --> 01:36:40,890
Listen, democracy, son.

1694
01:36:41,130 --> 01:36:42,270
That's what it's all about.

1695
01:36:47,150 --> 01:36:50,150
I think that's about everything I can show you right now.

1696
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:51,490
So, any other questions?

1697
01:36:51,730 --> 01:36:52,130
Comments?

1698
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:56,880
If you have any last questions, you guys, any last questions?

1699
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:05,290
Someone asked, did this carrier operate the F7U cutlass?

1700
01:37:08,050 --> 01:37:09,130
The F7U?

1701
01:37:09,550 --> 01:37:10,090
Cutlass.

1702
01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:11,030
Cutlass.

1703
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:12,990
No, it did not.

1704
01:37:13,830 --> 01:37:16,290
We had A4s and A7s.

1705
01:37:16,630 --> 01:37:19,290
The A7 Corsair and obviously A4.

1706
01:37:20,110 --> 01:37:21,370
But we did not have the cutlass.

1707
01:37:22,930 --> 01:37:25,410
Someone said, any F4s still on display?

1708
01:37:26,730 --> 01:37:27,670
So, actually, yes.

1709
01:37:27,830 --> 01:37:30,390
We have an F4 Phantom that's in the back of the ship.

1710
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:32,190
And unfortunately, I can't show it this time.

1711
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:32,710
I'm sorry.

1712
01:37:34,450 --> 01:37:36,350
But, it's actually in restoration right now.

1713
01:37:36,430 --> 01:37:41,130
So, pretty soon, come by the ship, you'll be able to see it fully restored and fresh to paint.

1714
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:45,530
Actually...

1715
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:49,190
Remember that pilot for the Skyhawk I told you about?

1716
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:50,970
Oh!

1717
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:06,470
Oh my god!

1718
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:07,290
That's crazy!

1719
01:38:14,870 --> 01:38:15,770
Wow!

1720
01:38:17,110 --> 01:38:18,230
Oh my god, he's styling.

1721
01:38:20,410 --> 01:38:21,370
So cool.

1722
01:38:21,370 --> 01:38:24,490
He's what we call a certified badass.

1723
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:26,330
I can tell.

1724
01:38:29,930 --> 01:38:32,290
Any other questions to answer while we're waiting on Alvin?

1725
01:38:32,530 --> 01:38:33,550
There's a lot of questions.

1726
01:38:33,710 --> 01:38:34,750
Hold on, I'm scrolling up.

1727
01:38:34,910 --> 01:38:42,350
Oh, someone asked if the Hornet will be moving anytime soon or if it's going to be always here?

1728
01:38:45,070 --> 01:38:47,590
So, we hope that one day we can move.

1729
01:38:47,950 --> 01:38:54,410
We do not know right now, but it's through support from viewers like you and generous donors that hopefully someday we can move.

1730
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:56,070
There you go.

1731
01:38:57,810 --> 01:39:03,330
Oh, someone said, did you guys film any movies, shows, documentaries at the museum that they should check out?

1732
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:08,070
There are actually multiple documentaries that have been shot aboard the ship.

1733
01:39:08,330 --> 01:39:19,630
One of our movies called Eleven, which goes over torpedo group BS-11, goes over the history of a torpedo squadron that was here on the ship during World War II.

1734
01:39:19,770 --> 01:39:20,630
You can find that online.

1735
01:39:20,770 --> 01:39:21,870
It's called Eleven the Movie.

1736
01:39:22,370 --> 01:39:24,110
But there are multiple documentaries.

1737
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:31,490
World of Warships actually did a really great in-depth job going over the Hornet's armament, going over its statistics, talking a little bit about its history.

1738
01:39:31,490 --> 01:39:36,650
You can go check that out on World of Warships website called Naval Legends.

1739
01:39:37,030 --> 01:39:37,970
Naval Legends?

1740
01:39:38,110 --> 01:39:39,070
World of Warships?

1741
01:39:39,190 --> 01:39:39,570
No way.

1742
01:39:40,290 --> 01:39:41,650
Well, it looks like Alan's busy.

1743
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:43,050
No worries.

1744
01:39:43,630 --> 01:39:44,130
All right, folks.

1745
01:39:44,690 --> 01:39:47,810
But yes, you can find a lot of good stuff on different.

1746
01:39:47,950 --> 01:39:49,170
You can also look at our YouTube page.

1747
01:39:49,430 --> 01:39:52,490
We actually have some great miniaturized tours and little nuggets.

1748
01:39:52,670 --> 01:40:00,290
We also have a plane facts video that goes over some of the aircraft in more depth with an actual pilot.

1749
01:40:02,210 --> 01:40:04,210
Someone asked, do you like Ace Combat?

1750
01:40:04,450 --> 01:40:05,430
Have you ever played Ace Combat?

1751
01:40:06,290 --> 01:40:07,470
I have played Ace Combat.

1752
01:40:07,630 --> 01:40:08,670
I've played it many times.

1753
01:40:08,730 --> 01:40:09,510
I love Ace Combat.

1754
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:19,570
Actually, funny enough, the devs of Ace Combat actually came to the Hornet to do some 3D imagery to be able... I don't know what's going to happen in the future, but they did come by a while back.

1755
01:40:20,570 --> 01:40:21,350
Shut up.

1756
01:40:21,510 --> 01:40:22,310
Wait, actually?

1757
01:40:22,630 --> 01:40:23,650
I don't know what's happening.

1758
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:24,970
I just know they were from Ace Combat.

1759
01:40:25,850 --> 01:40:27,010
Shuai, shut up.

1760
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:29,570
Wait, like recently?

1761
01:40:32,030 --> 01:40:32,470
Yup.

1762
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:35,990
Oh my god.

1763
01:40:36,410 --> 01:40:42,540
I think you just made... that's so... where is Nan?

1764
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:47,880
I don't know the answer to that, but it was really cool meeting some of them.

1765
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,940
They came all the way from Japan.

1766
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:54,900
And you know, they were really amazed by just seeing this place because they've never seen an aircraft carrier before.

1767
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:00,780
Oh my god.

1768
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:06,740
Okay, I think we need to end on that because I don't think we can talk about that information at all.

1769
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:07,840
Oh my god.

1770
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:09,340
Well, we don't know.

1771
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:10,020
We don't know.

1772
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:10,340
No!

1773
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:11,940
Right, right, right.

1774
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:13,260
We know, but we don't know.

1775
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:14,580
It's an unknown unknown.

1776
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:16,720
So if you know the know, you know the know.

1777
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:17,520
Double know.

1778
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:18,440
Know what I mean?

1779
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:18,980
Know what I mean?

1780
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:19,380
Yeah.

1781
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:24,800
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for this.

1782
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:25,640
This is so much fun.

1783
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:28,300
I think everybody loved it so much too.

1784
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:32,280
I've seen a couple people being like this is like one of my favorite streams you've done Mint.

1785
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:35,620
So like, this has been just incredible.

1786
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:36,460
Thank you.

1787
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:40,140
Everyone's still calling you Jeff.

1788
01:41:42,820 --> 01:41:45,700
I see a couple Gabe Jeffs, don't worry.

1789
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:47,480
Gabe Jeffs, okay.

1790
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:51,180
Well, thank you very much for doing this tour.

1791
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:57,060
We were happy to have you for Offices in Live and just taking the time to take out the ship, share with your community the ship.

1792
01:41:57,260 --> 01:42:00,700
I do encourage you if you're ever here, always welcome aboard the ship.

1793
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:04,620
But also any of your viewers if you're ever here, please come support the ship.

1794
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:06,180
The Hornet is a magical place.

1795
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:08,460
You have some great veterans here who've served.

1796
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:14,760
You have some great docents that knowledge, the wealth of just history that's here aboard the ship.

1797
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:15,620
It's unfathomable.

1798
01:42:15,620 --> 01:42:30,820
And as a young person who's just gotten involved with the ship, I can safely say that anything you do counts, whether it's $2, whether it's a ticket to the museum, attending an event, or even just buying a piece of merch off our store.

1799
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,580
It really helps to keep us afloat because we want to keep the Hornet around for many years to come.

1800
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:38,840
Honey, you guys don't forget that Azure Lane stuff if you're like, oh, yeah.

1801
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:41,820
We still buy our Azure Lane merch here at World of Ship.

1802
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:42,180
Yeah.

1803
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:45,800
Well, actually, where can people donate?

1804
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:47,340
Someone's asking, where can we donate?

1805
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:49,740
You can find it on our website.

1806
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:54,980
So if you go to USSHornet.org, there's a big yellow tab in the top right corner.

1807
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:57,700
You can click it and it'll take you to our donation page.

1808
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:58,560
Straight there.

1809
01:42:58,720 --> 01:42:59,340
There you go.

1810
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:11,260
If you are interested in donating to other museum ships, on Befleetproject.com, we actually have a donate tab that links multiple museum ships around the country and the world.

1811
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:14,280
You have a direct link to go to their donate page.

1812
01:43:14,420 --> 01:43:17,200
This is USS Massachusetts, the Battleship Museum in New England.

1813
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:18,340
This is Yorktown.

1814
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:19,820
This is Iowa, Wisconsin.

1815
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:21,260
You can find all that there.

1816
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,560
So that's just a resource available.

1817
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:32,040
Well, actually, before you go, I'm giving you another tour today.

1818
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:35,460
Alan, can you introduce yourself to the folks at home and what you did in the Navy?

1819
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:45,560
Yes, I am Alan Caranga and I flew the A-4 Skyhawk, which is this airplane right here, off the USS Ticonderoga during the Vietnam Conflict.

1820
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:46,680
Oh, my gosh.

1821
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:48,040
Thank you for your service, sir.

1822
01:43:56,920 --> 01:44:00,100
Yes, thank you for your service, sir.

1823
01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:01,200
It was nice meeting you.

1824
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:04,240
I'm giving another tour.

1825
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:07,240
I'm a wise guy, right?

1826
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:12,740
Hey, you trained me, so I get the credit.

1827
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:16,780
I was glad to see that Cal came back and beat Stanford.

1828
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:19,500
Yeah, but we lost SMU the next week.

1829
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:22,060
Okay, we got blown out.

1830
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:23,120
See you Saturday.

1831
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:24,120
See you Saturday.

1832
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:27,300
What's happening Saturday?

1833
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:31,440
I come here and I usually work on Saturdays here.

1834
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:36,420
I usually try to tag along on tours or helping out at the front desk wherever we can to help with operating.

1835
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:40,020
Even though I'm a marketing manager, I'm never above helping out.

1836
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:46,480
Okay, guys, if you want to meet Jeff Gabe, you got to come on Saturdays.

1837
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:52,220
Is that my name?

1838
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:59,400
You know, some of my talent is watching right now, so if they actually see me, I'm going to get shit for sure.

1839
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:05,060
That comes with the job.

1840
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:06,540
Yeah, I know.

1841
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:09,820
I get emails every day.

1842
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:13,740
It's a badge of honor.

1843
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:17,520
Like I told you, Ms. Mint, you got to love it.

1844
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:19,120
You got to love the opportunities you give people.

1845
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,900
And again, it's about magical places like this every day.

1846
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:24,360
Thank you so much.

1847
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:25,680
This was a lot of fun.

1848
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:31,000
Hopefully we can do something again.

1849
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:35,340
Anytime you want, Ms. Mint, I'm always available for you.

1850
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:39,020
Thank you.

1851
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:40,760
Thanks, folks.

1852
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:42,380
You guys have a great evening.

1853
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:44,180
Ms. Mint, always a pleasure.

1854
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:45,400
Looking forward to the future.

1855
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:48,820
And again, guys, thank you for your support.

1856
01:45:48,820 --> 01:45:49,860
Thank you.

1857
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,400
Everybody say thank you, Jeff, Gabe.

1858
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:52,980
Thank you.

1859
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:53,660
Bye-bye.

1860
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:55,000
Say bye-bye.

1861
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:02,210
Yeah, I'm saluting.

1862
01:46:02,470 --> 01:46:03,190
You just can't see.

1863
01:46:04,050 --> 01:46:04,750
I see it.

1864
01:46:05,610 --> 01:46:11,930
I'm going to talk to my chat for a bit, so I will disconnect and I will talk to you all later.

1865
01:46:12,910 --> 01:46:13,770
No problem.

1866
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:14,790
We'll see you soon, okay?

1867
01:46:14,930 --> 01:46:15,590
Thank you.

1868
01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:16,290
Bye-bye.

1869
01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:25,360
I had this background.

1870
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:26,580
Sorry for the flashbang.

1871
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:34,080
Yeah, I hope you guys liked the tour.

1872
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:40,160
So sorry, so sorry.

1873
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:42,300
That was so cool.

1874
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:45,220
Yeah, he is very passionate.

1875
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:47,700
You can tell about everything.

1876
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:48,920
Great stream, Ms. Mint.

1877
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,320
I'm not used to that.

1878
01:46:51,380 --> 01:46:52,480
I'm the maid, you know.

1879
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:55,980
I'm not used to being called Ms. Mint.

1880
01:46:56,340 --> 01:47:03,520
I call the master and mistress, you know, Mr. and Mrs. Let me put on some music real quick.

1881
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:08,080
Perfect.

1882
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:12,280
Yeah, I hope you guys liked it.

1883
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:13,480
It's, you know...

1884
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:17,020
I'm glad that we had the opportunity.

1885
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:22,960
Is his name really Jeff?

1886
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:23,940
No, it's Gabe.

1887
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:25,480
I think he was doing a bit.

1888
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:29,940
He was doing a bit and Jeff just...

1889
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:33,060
It kind of stuck.

1890
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:43,150
But yeah, I did the off-season live on the carrier and then...

1891
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:47,060
He messaged after and was like, if you ever want to do a tour...

1892
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:52,300
A video tour, like a stream tour, we can set that up.

1893
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:57,480
And so I'm really grateful because I think he said that the museum is closed today.

1894
01:47:57,480 --> 01:48:03,480
So he took the time to show us around, which I guess is better because we didn't have any...

1895
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:09,300
It was a totally private tour for us.

1896
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:16,120
So if you're ever in the area, of course, please go to the USS Hornet and you'll be able to see all the fun stuff.

1897
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:19,960
And all the history and all the mechanics.

1898
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:21,990
I'm sad because they have the...

1899
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:28,360
It was behind the curtain where all the rave lights were, but they have the...

1900
01:48:28,850 --> 01:48:36,560
The little area where the astronauts went when they landed and they had to decontaminate them and everything.

1901
01:48:36,860 --> 01:48:38,160
I think that's so cool.

1902
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:39,560
Stuff like that, you know?

1903
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:42,680
So cool seeing the tour near me.

1904
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:43,460
Went with my dad.

1905
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:44,420
Oh, nice!

1906
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:48,080
What was that Vtuber group he mentioned?

1907
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:49,200
Vfleet.

1908
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:51,320
Like V and then fleet.

1909
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:52,940
So check them out!

1910
01:48:53,060 --> 01:48:53,980
The girls are so sweet.

1911
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:54,940
I met some of them.

1912
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:58,480
And some of them were in chat earlier.

1913
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:00,560
Yeah, Vfleet.

1914
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:03,200
Yes, yes, yes.

1915
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:06,440
And I can't believe it's all volunteers.

1916
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:11,660
I didn't know the stuff about the volunteers fixing everything up.

1917
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:12,660
And...

1918
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:18,780
And, like, everybody having to donate stuff.

1919
01:49:18,860 --> 01:49:19,620
That's crazy.

1920
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:21,060
Crazy, crazy.

1921
01:49:30,350 --> 01:49:32,730
But yeah, I hope you guys had fun.

1922
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:37,510
And a little history, but we got to nerd out a bit today.

1923
01:49:37,650 --> 01:49:38,710
It was fun, fun, fun.

1924
01:49:39,190 --> 01:49:41,810
I just heard quite a few Vfleet Vtubers also play Ace Combat.

1925
01:49:41,810 --> 01:49:42,170
Nan!

1926
01:49:43,850 --> 01:49:45,030
Nan, did you hear?

1927
01:49:46,070 --> 01:49:46,950
Nan, you're here.

1928
01:49:47,030 --> 01:49:47,730
Wait, did you hear?

1929
01:49:50,270 --> 01:49:51,410
That was such an awesome stream.

1930
01:49:51,490 --> 01:49:52,710
Thank you for... Oh, sorry.

1931
01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:54,450
Giving us the opportunity.

1932
01:49:54,950 --> 01:49:55,890
I owe a tour a win.

1933
01:49:56,850 --> 01:49:59,690
We can find someone who will tour us, you know?

1934
01:50:00,570 --> 01:50:01,910
I didn't care if he mentioned Carrier Con.

1935
01:50:01,990 --> 01:50:02,770
He did, he did.

1936
01:50:03,010 --> 01:50:05,590
One of the two times I went with the Hornet was when I spent like $400.

1937
01:50:06,230 --> 01:50:07,030
It was lit.

1938
01:50:07,490 --> 01:50:09,650
Took a picture with some cute Azur Lane cosplayers.

1939
01:50:09,650 --> 01:50:11,590
And I was really sweaty.

1940
01:50:15,590 --> 01:50:20,930
Yeah, they said that they did Carrier Con and then also some Azur Lane official events.

1941
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:22,230
Which is just so awesome.

1942
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:25,390
Sorry, I was busy playing Ace Combat.

1943
01:50:26,090 --> 01:50:26,930
You know what?

1944
01:50:28,170 --> 01:50:30,990
You'll just have to watch, Nan.

1945
01:50:32,990 --> 01:50:35,210
You missed the Ace Combat information.

1946
01:50:36,070 --> 01:50:36,590
Shame.

1947
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:41,530
You missed the Ace Combat information.

1948
01:50:44,830 --> 01:50:47,050
Someone leave a timestamp for him.

1949
01:50:48,470 --> 01:50:48,790
Anyway.

1950
01:50:54,020 --> 01:50:56,340
Pro made so many references.

1951
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:57,060
I know!

1952
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:58,620
How tall was he again?

1953
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:00,500
Probably like, what?

1954
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:02,560
6'2"?

1955
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:05,860
Yeah.

1956
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:07,980
Just gotta work for it, Mint.

1957
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:08,960
Oh, okay, nevermind.

1958
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:09,500
You're right.

1959
01:51:10,580 --> 01:51:11,380
6'5".

1960
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:12,520
5'11".

1961
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:15,200
Thanks for such a cool stream, Ms. Mint.

1962
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:16,340
Thank you!

1963
01:51:16,580 --> 01:51:18,460
Thank you guys for joining me.

1964
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:20,200
Pigeon, thanks for the 5 gifted.

1965
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:21,800
Thank you for all the superchats.

1966
01:51:23,420 --> 01:51:26,320
And the gifted memberships and everything.

1967
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:30,760
I wanna go.

1968
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:33,140
I wanna go and meet the other ghosts.

1969
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:37,040
I wanna go and meet the other ghosts.

1970
01:51:37,380 --> 01:51:37,920
One day.

1971
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:38,680
Two!

1972
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:41,200
This tour was very interesting.

1973
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:43,340
Hope we can do more tours in other places in the future.

1974
01:51:43,540 --> 01:51:43,700
Yeah!

1975
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:45,300
I hope so too.

1976
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:47,120
I would love it.

1977
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:51,080
Especially when you get someone so passionate about it.

1978
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:55,720
And just wanting to really explain everything.

1979
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:59,060
I'm a big fan of US Navy so I enjoyed it so much.

1980
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:00,220
Thank you!

1981
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:04,660
Thank you!

1982
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:08,900
Gonna meet Freddy Fazbear.

1983
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:09,920
Yeah, yeah.

1984
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:17,420
He didn't mention it, but there's so few aircraft carriers left.

1985
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:22,420
Or rather, as museums in the US.

1986
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:31,260
It's important to remember history and learn from it.

1987
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:38,300
And also just so fascinating to see how technology was used back then and how it's advanced to where it is now.

1988
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:41,360
It's so cool.

1989
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:47,620
You gotta push Jeff into becoming a Vtuber.

1990
01:52:47,980 --> 01:52:48,880
That's not my job.

1991
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:50,520
The Vfleet girl should.

1992
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:53,440
He would be great on stream though, right?

1993
01:52:53,860 --> 01:52:55,020
Such a character.

1994
01:53:00,110 --> 01:53:01,310
Packing for the concert.

1995
01:53:09,610 --> 01:53:10,490
Concert soon.

1996
01:53:12,010 --> 01:53:14,970
Would you like to see a U-Boat tour?

1997
01:53:23,430 --> 01:53:25,670
Tour guide is a lot like streaming, honestly.

1998
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:28,710
German sub.

1999
01:53:30,010 --> 01:53:32,430
I would love to see so many tours.

2000
01:53:35,910 --> 01:53:37,630
Thank you for the spooky donut!

2001
01:53:38,490 --> 01:53:40,690
I don't know what to expect at first, but this is awesome.

2002
01:53:40,910 --> 01:53:42,370
I'm so glad you thought so!

2003
01:53:42,370 --> 01:53:47,670
I remember when he gave... It was me and Lisa.

2004
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:49,470
He gave us a short tour.

2005
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:51,510
Before off-season.

2006
01:53:52,470 --> 01:53:53,610
Off-season live.

2007
01:53:54,670 --> 01:53:57,570
So I knew it was gonna be a lot of fun, right?

2008
01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:02,550
Dr. Big Sausage!

2009
01:54:02,570 --> 01:54:03,570
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

2010
01:54:03,810 --> 01:54:04,570
It's our streak!

2011
01:54:05,110 --> 01:54:06,090
Yesterday was my birthday.

2012
01:54:06,210 --> 01:54:07,050
I'm old!

2013
01:54:07,910 --> 01:54:09,790
Can you sing me Happy Birthday MGS style?

2014
01:54:09,790 --> 01:54:11,030
Of course!

2015
01:54:11,730 --> 01:54:12,770
Of course, of course.

2016
01:54:13,790 --> 01:54:16,090
Happy birthday!

2017
01:54:16,410 --> 01:54:17,150
Congratulations!

2018
01:54:18,670 --> 01:54:20,170
Happy birthday!

2019
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:22,090
Salutations!

2020
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:24,050
Happy birthday!

2021
01:54:24,590 --> 01:54:27,250
May your sky stay blue!

2022
01:54:28,650 --> 01:54:31,690
Happy birthday to you!

2023
01:54:32,730 --> 01:54:33,410
It's our streak!

2024
01:54:33,930 --> 01:54:34,490
Happy birthday!

2025
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:42,700
Nice.

2026
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:46,480
Alrighty, guys.

2027
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:47,540
I'm gonna head out.

2028
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:51,360
It's really cool that y'all can set up tours like this.

2029
01:54:52,420 --> 01:54:54,220
So everyone can learn without having to be there.

2030
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:54,840
Thanks, Mito.

2031
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:56,900
Thank you guys for...

2032
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,180
For hanging out with me.

2033
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:02,160
And hanging out with us.

2034
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:03,440
And going on tour with us.

2035
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:05,080
Really appreciate it.

2036
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:06,340
Glad you guys liked it.

2037
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:09,480
So, have a good day!

2038
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:11,000
Have a good night!

2039
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:13,660
Otsu Mito!

2040
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:14,840
Otsu Mito!

2041
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:15,320
Otsu Mito!

2042
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:16,320
Otsu Mito!

2043
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,220
I will see you guys when I see you next!

2044
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:21,880
Have a good day!

2045
01:55:23,060 --> 01:55:24,640
Thank you for the stream!

2046
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:26,460
Bye-bye!

2047
01:55:26,780 --> 01:55:27,520
Bye-bye!

2048
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:28,760
Bye-bye-bye!

2049
01:55:29,140 --> 01:55:30,020
Bye-bye!
