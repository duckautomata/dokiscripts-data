00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,590
Do you, wait, do you hear pops?

11
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,110
Does this sound okay?

12
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:11,570
quite nervous um the setup for this uh is new so hopefully
it works i'm scared i'm i'm actually a little nervous but

13
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:20,510
that's okay sound okay yeah pop sarago

14
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:41,790
why scared is it display capture it's actually okay so i had
to feed the my switch to my monitor um but usually i do

15
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:51,750
instead um and so i capture usually from um or like i
usually capture or i usually play through obs but since it's

16
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:58,570
now directed to my monitor instead of playing through uh
through

17
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,870
what's this through

18
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,290
I Wait, what was I saying?

19
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,950
I don't remember What was I saying?

20
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:27,110
Wait, I would usually play through OBS And so the sound
comes out Like through my computer But when I put it, run it

21
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,870
through my monitor The sound was coming out through my
monitor And I was like, wait a second Then I won't be able

22
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,810
to hear the game And you guys could hear the game But I
wouldn't be able to hear the game.

23
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,270
And so I had to plug in another thing to my monitor.

24
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,310
But then I had a lot of feedback.

25
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,390
It was all like me.

26
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,270
And so I was just like, oh, how do I stop this?

27
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,070
And it was like two minutes before I started streaming.

28
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,430
And I was like, ah.

29
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,690
And I was like, ah.

30
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,890
And then I was like, ah.

31
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,490
And then I fixed it.

32
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,010
Silly.

33
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,530

Okay.

47
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,030
I can still turn it up.

48
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,730
But I don't want to...

49
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,950
I'm going to turn it down just a little bit just because I'm
scared of blowing my ears out and blowing your ears out.

50
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,230
So we're going to press English and we're going to see what
happens!

51
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,490
What if I play Italiano?

52
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,950
What if I...

53
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,770
What if I...

54
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:16,770
what if i played italiano does it need to be loud no i just
want to make sure that you guys can hear it that's all okay

55
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:28,150
mama mia we can check okay so this is next um i am playing
the switch version actually i do own the 3ds version i

56
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:42,450
bought it before the before the e-shop went down but i I
thought that maybe because of how 3DS capture is and

57
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:50,230
everything, I was worried that it might be hard to see the
screens, you know, like split screen and everything.

58
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,530
So there's a 3DS version.

59
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,610
There is.

60
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,290
There is.

61
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,530
But I just bought, I was like thinking about it earlier.

62
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,910
I was like, I'll play the 3DS version.

63
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:58,810
Then I thought about it.

64
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:04,970
I was like, oh, wait, maybe I should play on the Switch so
you guys can, it's best on Switch for streaming.

65
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:15,090
I don't know much about the gameplay, but I heard that you
draw stuff, so hopefully it's not so bad on the Switch with

66
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,370
like a controller and not the stylus, but it wasn't on 3DS,
it was really on DS.

67
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,310
Oh, really?

68
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,430
I thought it was a 3DS game.

69
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,350
Oh, oh, oh.

70
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,250
But yeah, so I'm playing it if you're curious, I am playing
it on the Switch.

71
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,310
Auto saves.

72
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:30,670
Okay.

73
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:39,620
Yeah!

74
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,680
Welcome to Ghost Trip!

75
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,380
Oh my gosh, Saku!

76
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,080
Why?

77
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,300
Thank you for the 50!

78
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,240
Thank you.

79
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,360
Thank you so much!

80
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,120
Thank you!

81
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,060
Oh my gosh.

82
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,260
There's already extras.

83
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,120
I'm curious.

84
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,140
But, um, time to flex your detective skills.

85
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,240
Oh!

86
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,780
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you silly little witch.

87
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
whisper you.

88
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,400
I happen to be stupid.

89
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,640
New game.

90
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,460
I got a small raise.

91
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,260
Membo ships for everyone.

92
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,100
Congrats!

93
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,100
Chapter 1, 702 p.m.

94
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,320
Actually, it's 717 p.m.

95
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,340
Is my switch clock off?

96
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,960
Must have been unconscious for a while.

97
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,680
My head feels fuzzy.

98
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,140
Kind of like I'm swimming through darkness oh my gosh when i
came to there was a woman standing there a woman i don't

99
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:53,800
know at least i don't think i know her okay the text is kind
of fast oh a dashing man and then there was a man with a gun

100
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:02,540
i don't know him either well probably not anyway oh wait is
that skullface oh no he has got a big nose never oh hands up

101
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:08,100
now i'm not the kind of guy who can just stand back and
watch a poor woman get shot but i have just one little

102
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,800
problem oh my ass is off I'm already dead myself!

103
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,920
This has gotta be me.

104
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,200
No question about that.

105
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,820
After all, do you see any other dead bodies lying around
here?

106
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,480
Hands where I can see him.

107
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,700
So, sister!

108
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,640
I feel bad for her, sure.

109
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,840
But what can I do?

110
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,580
I'm dead!

111
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,320
Just as I was thinking this.

112
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
So relatable.

113
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,420
There is no time to be lollying around dead.

114
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,500
You're the only one who can save her.

115
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,000
Me?

116
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,480
But I'm dead.

117
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,340
What the?

118
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,660
The whole world just changed on me.

119
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,020
Oh, now I can press.

120
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,680
Oh, okay.

121
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,860
Are you sure about that, boss?

122
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,220
What?

123
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,080
What do you mean?

124
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
Look, it's you!

125
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,200
That's you!

126
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,220
Right there!

127
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,200
Oh my gosh!

128
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,320
That's you!

129
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,620
Point, point, point!

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,760
That's you right there!

131
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,780
That's you!

132
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,880
I'm in the game!

133
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,960
Welcome to the ghost world!

134
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,900
The land of the dead!

135
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,120
Oh my gosh, you came here to see me, didn't you?

136
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,520
If Misses a super chat, did they get ghosted?

137
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,520
No?

138
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,660
I didn't miss any, did I?

139
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,360
Such an undignified position?

140
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:57,690
I'm famous a voice in my head who are you no time for
introductions now you have to save her you know you can do

144
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:50,960
take a look at your corpse do you see that blue flame that's
your soul and do you see that bright white spot nearby?

145
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,300
That's a core.

146
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,080
A core?

147
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,020
Hmm, looks like a railway crossing gate to me.

148
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,060
Look, the best way to understand it is just try it.

149
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,760
First of all, try moving your soul with the D-pad.

150
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,020
Can I move with...

151
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,800
Oh, whoa!

152
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,040
Oh!

153
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,640
That was so easy.

154
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,060
I'm a natural, obviously.

155
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,200
Congratulations!

156
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,500
Your soul is now possessed the crossing gate.

157
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,780
So what?

158
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,040
Now I'm a crossing gate?

159
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,360
Ahem.

160
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,280
Now then.

161
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,480
Use the crossing gate to save the woman.

162
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,220
Oh my gosh, I'm going to beat him over the head.

163
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,740
But how?

164
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,420
In a moment.

165
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,900
In a moment, time will start to flow normally again.

166
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,320
That will be your chance.

167
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,660
Listen, when the man pulls the trigger, the woman dies,
right?

168
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,660
So before that happens, you have to use your powers to
stop...

169
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,880
Oh gosh, is this game timed?

170
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,100
Oh boy.

171
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,280
Hey, wait a second.

172
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,980
I still don't know what you're talking about.

173
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,640
You'll see.

174
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,660
You'll all see.

175
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,140
Now then, time will start to flow again.

176
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,600
Oh!

177
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,040
Oof!

178
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:07,820
Ouch, yote.

179
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,740
Hold it!

180
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,060
How ace attorney have you?

181
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,600
Well played.

182
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,340
What just happened?

183
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,620
That was one of your powers.

184
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,180
at work.

185
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,160
A ghost trick!

186
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,160
You mean I made that crossing gate move?

187
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,600
That's right.

188
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,500
You manipulated that object with the power of the dead.

189
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,120
A ghost trick!

190
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,280
Yeah, cue the credits!

191
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,840
All you have to do to perform a trick like that is press A.

192
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,560
Now the woman's fate has changed, albeit just a little.

193
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,880
Yeah, she still has a gunpoint at every time.

194
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:50,880
Yes.

195
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,460
That's not good, isn't it?

196
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,100
But at least now you're starting to figure out how to use
your powers.

197
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,480
So I enter the ghost world with ghost.

198
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,720
I go, I'm, I'm ghost.

199
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,600
I'm gonna ghost all over the place.

200
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,900
Wait, let me put my hand down actually now that I think
about it.

201
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,780
Blasphemy, I know, but just so you guys can see a bit
better.

202
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,880
I'm gonna ghost all over the place.

203
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,440
Possess an object and then perform a trick with it, eh?

204
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,900
Bust in, bust in, bust in.

205
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,160
Now you're getting it.

206
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,700
Let's move on to the next step.

207
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,100
Try possessing a different core.

208
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,520
I have a guitar.

209
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,080
I see a guitar, then, is it?

210
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:41,560
Ahem.

211
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,440
Wait, no, I was just moving.

212
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,260
What do you want from me?

213
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,880
I would have preferred that giant wrecking ball.

214
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,480
That would solve the problem real quick, I bet.

215
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,120
But I guess I can't reach cores that are too far away.

216
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,400
It's right there.

217
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,180
It's not that far.

218
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,280
Well, I guess we'll see what you can do with that guitar.

219
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,880
Let's set time and motion again and find out.

220
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,480
Oh, am I going to fail the tutorial?

221
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,020
Uh, boom.

222
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,360
Who's there?

223
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,240
Ow!

224
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,620
Oh, nice.

225
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,500
Hold it.

226
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,720
That's gotta be some of the slowest running away I've ever
seen.

227
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,980
Oh, you couldn't reach for the wrecking balls too far.

228
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,140
Got it.

229
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Looks like I'm gonna have to come up with something more.

230
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,600
Oh, my... I can possess my dead body.

231
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,480
What core is close enough to possess from here?

232
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,220
I guess all there is is me.

233
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,320
No time to be picky.

234
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,660
I've got a woman to save.

235
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,580
I like your attitude.

236
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,640
It's admirable, truly, but...

237
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:49,940
what?

238
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,860
If I can manipulate objects, I can manipulate my own body.

239
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,680
Then I ought to be able to manipulate my own corpse, right?

240
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,680
Well, tell you what.

241
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,740
Why don't you just try it and see?

242
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,360
Go ahead and possess your corpse.

243
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:05,460
Okay.

244
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,040
Alright, now we'll set time in motion.

245
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,680
Go ahead and try A.

246
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,440
Is this going to be really freaky?

247
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:17,780
Oh.

248
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:31,200
Nothing's exactly sad but true I'm afraid you can only
manipulate non-living thing um I'm non-living true clearly

249
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:38,720
corpses even though they are oh my gosh Daniel thank you for
the Akasuba hope you enjoy the game that's one of my

250
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:47,300

they aren't alive anymore aren't really just ordinary things

251
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:58,260

wait what about the woman what's happening to her let's take

252
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:05,940

move the screen oh move the screen oh I don't know what you

253
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:14,900

video game it's easy give it a try use the d-pad to move it

254
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,900
in any you want.

255
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,920
Oh, oh.

256
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:21,720
Wow.

257
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,700
How was that?

258
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,960
I love this game.

259
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,140
I hope you'll like it too.

260
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:28,760
Thanks.

261
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,960
Whenever you want to see what's going on somewhere, just
move the screen.

262
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,360
Okay, I got it.

263
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,800
Mitt, turn off the game console.

264
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,380
Right now, I want to see what's happening to that woman.

265
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,900
Of course.

266
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,260
Well, you know what to do then.

267
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,300
Move the screen and see if you can find her.

268
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,760
There she is.

269
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,940
Well, sister, this is it.

270
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,940
Press Alt F4.

271
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,420
You have to plug the controller into port 4.

272
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,220
Two things are looking pretty dim right now.

273
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,460
My eyesight and your future!

274
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,540
No way!

275
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,160
She's dead!

276
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,800
Oh, I didn't strum hard enough.

277
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,100
Ringlingling!

278
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,040
The graphics in this, is this a...

279
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,480
Is this like a remake?

280
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,780
Out of my way!

281
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,840
Oh my god!

282
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,700
Oh, it is a remake.

283
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,920
It looks so good.

284
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,940
Or remaster.

285
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:39,780
Yeah.

286
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,080
Because it was a DS game, right?

287
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,240
Yeah, so...

288
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,900
Oh my god, would someone please pick up the phone!

289
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,600
It's done.

290
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,680
On my way.

291
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
Oh, and...

292
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,960
Oh, whoa!

293
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,400
We look so cool.

294
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:01,900
Um.

295
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,620
What was that?

296
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,620
Did he bow at me?

297
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,660
In the end, it looks like her fate remains unchanged.

298
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,080
So what good are these ghost tricks of mine?

299
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,900
But just as I was thinking this...

300
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:17,310
Oop.

301
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,150
Oop.

302
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,170
This lamp came...

303
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:21,570
Oh, my gosh.

304
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,610
The Pixar lamp.

305
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,610
No way!

306
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,270
I'm talking to a lamp!

307
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,650
Oh no, my delusions are really acting up today.

308
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:33,450
Hello there.

309
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,690
How are you feeling?

310
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,590
Not very well, I imagine.

311
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,010
A terrible tragedy.

312
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:38,970
What happened tonight?

313
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,410
Pixar real?

314
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,450
Ah, ignoring me, are you?

315
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,530
It's a little too early for you to be so stiff and cold, I'd
say.

316
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,110
I love lamp.

317
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,390
So it was you.

318
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,270
You were that voice in my head, right?

319
00:20:53,990 --> 00:21:09,830
the dead don't have voices you see it's more oh my gosh wait
was the Pixar lamp murdered the plot thickens it's more like

320
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:20,150
my thoughts were being beamed directly into your mind that's
another little trick ghosts can do oh yeah I can do that

321
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:30,530
obviously I do that to you guys all the time anytime you
think about mint it's me beaming into your mind think about

323
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,510
you Thanks for the super chat!

324
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,370
Looks like my ghost tricks didn't do much good.

325
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,450
Oh, rip.

326
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:05,990
Actual rip.

327
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,890
She still ended up just as dead as before.

328
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,030
How do I suddenly have mint chocolate ice in my hand?

329
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,050
That's true.

330
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:16,910
For now.

331
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:18,810
For now?

332
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,370
I still have more to teach you about the powers of the dead.

333
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,630
Your ghost tricks.

334
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,830
Who exactly are you anyway?

335
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,610
One of your fans.

336
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,650
Before I answer that, I think we should save this young
lady.

337
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,190
Wait, how do we do that?

338
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:42,450
Isn't it a shame to see such a pretty young woman lying here
like a discarded piece of trash?

339
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:48,230
Did I give mint all your money beamed right into my head
right now?

340
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,630
Thank you for the supercharge!

341
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,670
Thank you.

342
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,410
The name's Pixar.

343
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,210
Disney Pixar.

344
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,590
Well, what can I do?

345
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,650
She's already dead.

346
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,150
Is she?

347
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,630
Time for more ghost lessons for you, my friend.

348
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,630
First of all, I'll have you possess me.

349
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,770
Possess you, eh?

350
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,110
Once you've done that, I'll tell you about another one of
your powers.

351
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,010
I like the lighting, this.

352
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,950
Why am I so determined to save this woman?

353
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:24,930
After all, it's not like I know her, but I guess I'll take
the desk lamp up on his invitation anyway.

354
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,430
My reason is twofold.

355
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,850
I mean, what else do we have to do, right?

356
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:35,470
Number one, I'm not the type to leave women lying around
discarded like trash.

357
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,490
Good job, ghost trick.

358
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,750
Mr. Ghost trick.

359
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,150
And number two, I don't have anything else to lose at this
point.

360
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,030
So true.

361
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,250
That's how I feel.

362
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,950
Trick time!

363
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,810
Uh, what is this?

364
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,130
X?

365
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,690
That thought bubble you just pressed.

366
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,250
Those are your thoughts.

367
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,230
What you're saying to yourself in your head.

368
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,590
I'm thinking?

369
00:23:59,130 --> 00:23:59,450
Ah!

370
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:00,490
Ow!

371
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,770
My thoughts, eh?

372
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,870
So the dead don't have voices.

373
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,270
Mint in my head told me to do this or she'd beat me up.

374
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,270
And what we think is communicated directly to one another.

375
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,590
So these thought bubbles are sort of a stand-in.

376
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,310
I think I'm starting to get it.

377
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,690
John Ghosttrick respects women.

378
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:26,750
Be like John.

379
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,830
Thank you for the super chat to you guys.

380
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:32,930
I think so too.

381
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,850
Just remember to always keep an eye out for thought bubbles.

382
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:37,970
Okay, good idea.

383
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,070
I might, I just might get some important clues from them.

384
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:43,490
Now then.

385
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,810
Possess me!

386
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,130
In order to possess me, you first have to enter the ghost
world.

387
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,790
And L is your ticket in.

388
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,190
Oh my gosh, I'm ghosting, I'm ghosting.

389
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,310
The best thing to do is to try it.

390
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:56,870
LA?

391
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,270
I guess I'll press it.

392
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:02,930
I'm ghosting!

393
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,250
Door.

394
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,350
Traffic sign.

395
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,050
Oh, by the way, I'll be taking a look at the middle of the
screen.

396
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,590
Oh, what about it?

397
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:20,290
It tells you what trick you can perform with the object
you're currently possessing.

398
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:25,430
What does that mean if I put a mint in my mouth?

399
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,110
Oh, if it put a mint in my mouth.

400
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,170
Means brush your teeth more.

401
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,850
Don't forget to floss.

402
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:41,170
The information is there for you to check out whenever you
need it.

403
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,170
So in the case of this folding cot, it looks like I can
unfold it.

404
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:50,450
And to perform a trick on the object you're possessing, you
first have to return to the land of the living.

405
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:51,990
Oh, okay.

406
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,830
This time, B is your ticket out of the ghost room.

407
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,890
Well, good luck, we're counting on you.

408
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,950
Who is this wheat?

409
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:01,990
Flag.

410
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,010
Oh.

411
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:06,610
Wow.

412
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,710
Take me to dinner first.

413
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,030
Oh, I can't reach the phone.

414
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:14,710
I'm a weak.

415
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,070
Wait, how do I get to the...

416
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,130
How do I...

417
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,150
Oh, so I have to figure out a way to...

418
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,350
Maybe if I un...

419
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:27,030
If I unfold it, maybe I can, uh...

420
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:45,930
trick there we go haha now I'm closer now I'm gonna ghost
again wait what's that up there she's getting it mmm use the

421
00:26:45,930 --> 00:27:01,030
fan no I got it I got it perfectly that's funny what is
what's so funny well she's a different color My corpse and

422
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,650
her corpse.

423
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,070
There's definitely something different about the two.

424
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,630
There's something emanating from my corpse.

425
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,350
That's because...

426
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,870
You're dead!

427
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:10,830
Oh, I'm special.

428
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,270
I'm special.

429
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,050
What was that supposed to mean?

430
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,330
Not everybody who dies gets special powers, you know.

431
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,850
So those waves are because of my powers of the dead.

432
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,130
The smell of decay.

433
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,010
That's my...

434
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:34,950
my stench wafting the dead smell.

435
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,170
Anyway, congratulations.

436
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:39,930
You passed.

437
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,630
Well, what do you know?

438
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,890
What prize do I get?

439
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:44,490
A new power.

440
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,150
What else?

441
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,570
Another one?

442
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,190
Now let's review.

443
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,230
You can possess objects and manipulate them, right?

444
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,230
Now what do you suppose will happen if you possess a corpse?

445
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,070
Nothing because I already tried that, remember?

446
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,350
Nothing happened at all.

447
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:08,930
true you don't have the ability to manipulate a corpse but
but I think it's kind of I don't even know her and I'm

448
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:21,950
already like possessing her body like and she's I mean she's
I she's like so beautiful I just he called her sister I mean

449
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:28,530
that doesn't mean we're related right whatever it's just a
family am I possessing my sister help me step bro I'm dead

450
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,670
however there's There's something else you can do.

451
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:32,510
Oh, yeah?

452
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,490
What's that?

453
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,650
Why don't you try it and see?

454
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,610
Oh, okay.

455
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,770
I would like a little bit of a warning.

456
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,090
What I'm about to do.

457
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,430
I'm going ghost!

458
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,250
Oh, whoa.

459
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,670
What is it?

460
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,630
What's this?

461
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,410
ViviCourt, thanks for the five.

462
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,430
Gifted, thank you.

463
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,240
Can you hear me?

464
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,580
It's you guys.

465
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:18,080
wait a minute what's going on here hmm looks like she's
unconscious poor thing unconscious but she's dead I don't

466
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:24,120
know I know you don't like spicy food but any chance of a
hot ones podcast with Tara that's so funny you brought that

467
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:32,760
up Robert because I literally watched the hot ones I don't
know do you call them episodes the hot ones video with O

468
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,700
'Brien earlier.

469
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,000
I love that guy.

470
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,780
He's so funny.

471
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,720
He's so crazy.

472
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,400
But think back.

473
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,740
Remember when you died?

474
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,840
He just started chugging it.

475
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,800
Yeah, he's so unhinged.

476
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,140
It was the best episode.

477
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:52,920
It's so good.

478
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:59,160
If you haven't watched it, even if you don't know anything
about Conan O'Brien, I think that episode will teach you

479
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,780
everything you need to know about that guy.

480
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,820
When you came to your senses, you'd been unconscious, too.

481
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,560
Unconscious, eh?

482
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,500
Mint, please wake up.

483
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,140
I'm alive.

484
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,500
I'm not alive.

485
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,260
I'm awake.

486
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,780
Come to think of it.

487
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,000
The desk lamp is right.

488
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,980
When I came, too, I was already dead.

489
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,300
How long had I been asked up there for...

490
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,720
How long did they leave me like that?

491
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,920
Let's leave her like this for now.

492
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,220
And while she's resting, We can save her life.

493
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,520
Oh, sure.

494
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,760
You make it sound so easy.

495
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,080
And it is easy.

496
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:45,200
When you use your powers on a corpse, you can go back to the
past to a time four minutes before that person's dead.

497
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,540
Are you serious?

498
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:48,940
Back through time?

499
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,200
My new dream collab is Mint and Conan O'Brien.

500
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:53,740
Okay.

501
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,140
I'll do my best to have a collab with Conan O'Brien.

502
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,520
Someday.

503
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:00,860
Someday.

504
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:11,760
right but there's a catch it only works on new corpses
corpses that have been dead for less than one day then why

505
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:19,460
didn't you do that on my body huh and she's still wet what
so well fuck sorry

506
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:39,820
sorry I was thinking like a fresh I was thinking like a
fresh body, you know, like, like, you know how, like, when

507
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,980
you, okay, when I think of like a fresh body, it's like
meaty and wet, you know what I mean?

508
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,360
So, girl,

509
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:55,450
she's still well within that limit.

510
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,350
Okay, you, okay, I know what happened.

511
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:04,690
The, the T from the limit went up, and I just, I only saw T.

512
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,870
I read too quickly, okay?

513
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,350
She's moist.

514
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,550
Oh no.

515
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,650
You've been holding out on us.

516
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:23,490
We knew you were a cute ghost maid, but we didn't know you
also had a cute time traveling ghost maid.

517
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,510
I don't know.

518
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,930
I don't know if I have that powers.

519
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,010
You might want to give it a try before it's too late.

520
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,090
But this is crazy.

521
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,370
None of it makes any sense.

522
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,970
We're talking about the powers of the dead here.

523
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,470
Now then, let's go, shall we?

524
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,930
So the time four minutes before this woman was murdered.

525
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:45,770
Hey, wait a second.

526
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,890
I still don't know what you're talking about.

527
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,890
You'll see.

528
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,170
You'll see.

529
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,650
Rewind time.

530
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,930
Ghost only haunt wet corpses.

531
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:04,730
Taking note.

532
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,530
Freshly moist.

533
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,270
Not, we can't have the decay.

534
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:09,670
You know?

535
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:14,750
Oh, and so now I'm going back in time to witness this
woman's last four minutes alive.

536
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:19,550
Not as a fuzzy, distant memory of the past, but as a very
real living present.

537
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,070
Four minutes before death.

538
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:25,610
Oh!

539
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,250
Oh my gosh!

540
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,490
This music is so ace attorney.

541
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:32,470
What?

542
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:39,710
Can you imagine if we, like, go back four minutes in time
and, like, some person was just, like, woohoo!

543
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:49,510
are totally unrelated across the other side of the world
they were like i just won the checkpot the lottery but

544
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:57,370
because we went back four minutes in time and we're doing
some butterfly effect for some something is changing where

545
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:02,970
the guy is gonna like drop his ticket instead and just loses
everything

546
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:13,290
that'd be so sad time paradox Wake up!

547
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,070
Are you okay?

548
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:15,330
What happened to you?

549
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,770
Oh no, he's dead!

550
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,250
Don't say it like it's a bad thing.

551
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,690
Mint mics to Kwasa collab.

552
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,110
I can't, he's my Oshi.

553
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,600
I'm too scared to collab with Oshi's.

554
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,720
Who are you?

555
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:35,660
Cucumber!

556
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,140
Welcome to membership, thank you!

557
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,020
I'm Skullface.

558
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,540
This is Brother.

559
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,880
Here's my business card right here.

560
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:53,480
sister my little gold oh my little golden friend you did
this you killed him didn't you instead of playing who done

561
00:34:53,480 --> 00:35:00,580
it right now you ought to be more concerned about your own
fate who is she who is he why why are we here I have so many

562
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:11,400
questions who are you some sort of a hitman what do you want
with me they said we had to rub out all the last traces of

563
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,740
Temsic left in the country.

564
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,540
Temsec?

565
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,980
What in the world is that?

566
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:18,980
It's me.

567
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,060
I just do what I... How are you supposed to wipe out what
you don't even know what it is?

568
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,720
All I know is you've got nowhere else to run to.

569
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,760
Time to die, sister.

570
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,020
Oh.

571
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:31,720
Oh.

572
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,060
As long as that bad boy wrecking ball.

573
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,880
I sure hope this wrecking ball doesn't fall on my head and
crush me.

574
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,060
That would be so bad.

575
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,320
As long as that bad boy Wrecking Ball stays right up there
where it belongs.

576
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,940
Look, all I want to know is who are you?

577
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,420
You don't know me.

578
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,780
And I don't know you.

579
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,720
This is just business.

580
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,520
He's so cool.

581
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,580
So long, sister.

582
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,720
Oh, nice.

583
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,340
Oof.

584
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,880
Hold it.

585
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,980
Who's there?

586
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,840
Wait, this is all that what we did before, but...

587
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,080
Hold it!

588
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,360
Shotgun?

589
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,100
What kind of a flashy weapon for a hitman, don't...

590
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,420
Oh, kind of a flashy weapon for a hitman, don't you think?

591
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,700
Too shy to collab with Oshi's ma'am, you did the exact thing
the other day?

592
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,340
I know!

593
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,200
And look how it turned out!

594
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,000
Not flashy, just thorough.

595
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,320
They call me near-sighted Jigo.

596
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,380
But I never let my prey get away.

597
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,200
Get this man some glasses.

598
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,020
Never thought about just buying a pair of glasses.

599
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,620
Well, sister, this is it.

600
00:36:59,240 --> 00:36:59,980
Oh my god, no way.

601
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,160
That's her last words.

602
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,480
Two things are looking pretty dim right now.

603
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,300
My eyesight?

604
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,580
Oh, that's why he said his eyesight.

605
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,770
I don't know.

606
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,270
I love Nearsighted Jiggle.

607
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,230
And there you have it.

608
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,350
The last four minutes of her life.

609
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:21,210
No!

610
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,570
It's kind of ironic when you think about it.

611
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:28,810
A woman toyed with by fate and a man toyed with by a ghost.

612
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,930
But she still died.

613
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,230
Yes, and you can change that.

614
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:34,570
Well, they're ghost tricks!

615
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,910
Just like you did four minutes ago.

616
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,090
Possess and manipulate, eh?

617
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,470
Ghost and then trick.

618
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,670
Man, they love title dropping.

619
00:37:45,030 --> 00:38:02,790
it how was that ironic it's like rain on a wedding day it's
the green wait it's the it's the Sun it's the light when

620
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:13,410
you're already late wait green light does that How does that
make any sense?

621
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,790
Oh, free ride when you already paid.

622
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,950
Doesn't they say something when you're late?

623
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,070
Free ride when you already paid.

624
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,710
It's the good advice that you just didn't take.

625
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,150
And who would have thought it mattered?

626
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:38,250
You can rewind these four minutes as many times as you like
too.

627
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,130
Oh yeah!

628
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,050
Oh my gosh, I'm gonna keep watching.

629
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,530
watching this lady die.

630
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,130
Yeah, trauma!

631
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,950
Now then, are you ready?

632
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,070
Yeah, let's do it.

633
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,010
My soul hurts with all the strong things.

634
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,730
Oh, okay.

635
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:58,890
All right.

636
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:00,390
Soul.

637
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:03,690
So this is four minutes ago, eh?

638
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,210
Fine, I get that.

639
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,350
What am I doing way down here?

640
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,130
That's just how it works.

641
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:18,230
was your gateway into the past after all so naturally your
starting point is where her corpse was this is where she

642
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:34,750
died okay i get it now my favorite show lady dies on loop
it's not it's it's basically re-zero hop in then i'm

643
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:43,510
ghosting okay i'm in oh my god the time is going down okay
good job There are only four minutes left before she dies.

644
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,270
You had better try and get to her as fast as you can.

645
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:47,910
There's no time to lose.

646
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:49,810
Who are you?

647
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,990
Oh, oh, they're already...

648
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,130
Oh my gosh, she's already meeting him.

649
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:54,690
Let me play!

650
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,370
Time is passing.

651
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,130
The last seconds of her life are counting down.

652
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,210
Looks like I better get up there fast.

653
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,250
That's right.

654
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,170
Have a look at the right side of the screen.

655
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,550
The right side?

656
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,450
Oh, yes.

657
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:10,590
The sand meter.

658
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:10,950
Okay.

659
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:14,390
The sand in the top of that timer is how much time she has
left.

660
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,190
Get to her quickly before all the sand is gone.

661
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,390
Up you go, then.

662
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,230
I'm going, ghost!

663
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,590
Oh, wait.

664
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,390
Why'd you make me go up?

665
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,850
No, I'm going this way.

666
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:30,350
Wait.

667
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:32,590
Trick.

668
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,470
Okay, nice.

669
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:35,450
Ghost.

670
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:36,810
Up.

671
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,290
Can I turn this on?

672
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:47,430
And then maybe it will blow the flag so we can go up even
higher.

673
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:51,670
Oh, uh-oh.

674
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,190
Wait a second.

675
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:53,930
Uh.

676
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:58,770
Turn off.

677
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,650
Oh, okay.

678
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:03,790
I think I have to be faster.

679
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,350
I think I have to...

680
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,190
Okay, hold on.

681
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,070
I think I have to turn it on.

682
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:08,670
Trick.

683
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,050
And then ghost.

684
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:10,890
And then go.

685
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:11,790
Okay, there we go.

686
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:12,990
And then back.

687
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:14,350
All right.

688
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:15,910
Lift me up.

689
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:17,690
Lift me up.

690
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,210
And then...

691
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,070
Oh, no, I can't reach.

692
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:23,410
Oh, no.

693
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,270
Oh, wait.

694
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,250
Am I trapped now?

695
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,310
You guys, I think I...

696
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:33,150
Not backseating, but she done goofed.

697
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:36,390
I think I messed up.

698
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,370
Oh, oh, thank goodness.

699
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,290
Oh, my gosh.

00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,150
Oh my god.

704
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:20,390
Who are you?

705
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,370
Some sort of a hitman?

706
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,490
What do you want with me?

707
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,430
They said that we had to...

708
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,850
Time is passing.

709
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:30,010
Uh-oh.

710
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,050
Her time is running out.

711
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:31,810
Oh my gosh, you guys.

712
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,270
Uh, close.

713
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,150
Close.

714
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:39,790
The mannequin.

715
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:40,990
To this.

716
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:43,050
But what?

717
00:42:43,210 --> 00:43:04,510
what will this turn on I see I see I see I see so that will
it maybe it will catch on to the rope and then and then it

00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:30,050

left though stop stressing me out game she's cooking so I

720
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:42,210

it No, no, we want him to stand under the ball!

721
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,990
Now's your chance to change her fate!

722
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,050
There isn't much time left.

723
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,250
This is coming down to a battle of seconds!

724
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:51,570
Trick time!

725
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,290
Till death, wait.

726
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,150
Uh...

727
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,710
Ring the bell...

728
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:01,050
Or pedal.

729
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:02,950
Pedal to the metal.

730
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:04,590
Ring the bell.

731
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,290
Hmm...

732
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:14,100
He didn't like the guitar startled him before, so like,
Let's try it ringing.

733
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,460
What's going on here?

734
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:25,400
Near-sighted Gigo never misses, as long as the target is
within point-blank range.

735
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,300
Run far away!

736
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,860
It looks like you made it in time, just barely.

737
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,420
Yep, she's still alive.

738
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,220
Bro, get glasses for you.

739
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,280
And in that split second, hope was born.

740
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:47,280
Just now her fate was changed, albeit ever so slightly.

741
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,160
Yippee!

742
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,720
Oh, oh no, her leg.

743
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,400
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

744
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,900
The bridge is up!

745
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:00,460
Uh-oh.

746
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,280
Trick time!

747
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,660
Uh, petal?

748
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,060
Can I...

749
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,120
Oh, wait, X...

750
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,560
You said her fate was changed.

751
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:22,420
positive girl thanks for the 10 gifted but it looks like
she's still in the same predicament I said her fate was

752
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:31,420
changed ever so slightly what is this junkyard drawbridge
right they have a moat or something hold on I'm going to

753
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,340
take a bite of my food

754
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,380
I have some chicken and rice

755
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:55,980
because I'm going to have to take care of that guy once and
for all but there isn't much time left depending on what you

756
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:01,740
do there is still the possibility of failure you're so good
at being a ghost what's your secret

757
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:15,660
a laundry list I don't want to think about failure now no of
course not but still do you ever feel like you want to start

758
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:23,500
over just tap R before time runs out although you may never
know You might learn a thing or two when time runs out too.

759
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,700
All right, I'll keep that in mind.

760
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,320
Right now, I better go after those two.

761
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,240
Uh...

762
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,340
Oh no, there was a...

763
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:46,940
There was a bubble!

764
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:48,720
Not bad.

765
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:49,940
I got so excited.

766
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,280
You hear something?

767
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:56,760
Uh...

768
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:58,280
No...

769
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,440
That'd be like crazy.

770
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,240
He's under it again.

771
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,680
Oh, yeah, he is.

772
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,240
We can extend the ladder.

773
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,820
Oh, I can't wait to get this.

774
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:09,420
Oh, my gosh.

775
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,040
I'm so excited for these to get, like, super complicated.

776
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:12,960
I'm not going to lie.

777
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,800
I came in like a wreck.

778
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:22,720
Oh!

779
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:34,480
Oh!

780
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,300
Oh!

781
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:40,820
How does it feel to save a lady's life?

782
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,420
I killed someone else in the process!

783
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:43,720
Oh, my God.

784
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,840
Now he's going to haunt me.

785
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,360
So the danger is gone?

786
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,600
Yes, it looks like the danger.

787
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,560
Mr. Danger, in fact, rolled away somewhere.

788
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:55,620
He got Looney Tune.

789
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,680
You used your powers to advert that woman's fate.

790
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,940
What if she is, like, a really bad person?

791
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:14,420
What if she, like, what if she, like, created a drug that's
going to turn everybody, the whole world into zombies?

792
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:25,220
um that guy was trying to prevent that and we we just we
just uh we just doomed the whole world it's bad why cute so

795
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:57,540

797
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:17,350

00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:30,450
my gosh am I gonna be your ghost boyfriend I had saved the
life of this stranger now sitting forlornly in the rain oh

799
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:34,970
Even as the story of my life on this planet comes to an end.

800
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:39,850
Achoo!

801
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:41,370
Bless you!

802
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:43,350
Oh no!

803
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:44,450
A stranger.

804
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:46,570
That word strikes a chord.

805
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,410
And a terrible truth begins to dawn on me.

806
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:51,490
She could be the bad guy?

807
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:54,490
I can't recall a thing.

808
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:56,530
Tascaru.

809
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:58,050
So cute.

810
00:49:58,590 --> 00:49:59,690
Who am I?

811
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,090
What is this place?

812
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:03,370
And most important...

813
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,350
Imp...

814
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:07,610
Clearly not important if I can't even say it.

815
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:09,190
Most important of all!

816
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:12,770
Why was I killed?

817
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,560
I wonder that every day.

818
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,320
Your story isn't over yet.

819
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,920
Oh my gosh, wait, is this gonna end with us moving on?

820
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,060
And, you know, that's so sad.

821
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,380
Who exactly are you anyway?

822
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,650
Just call me Ray.

823
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:41,870
As in Ray of Light and the Darkness.

824
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:44,570
Ray, huh?

825
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,050
No way.

826
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:48,510
Metal Gear Ray.

827
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:49,430
No spoilers.

828
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,410
Yeah, this is my first time playing this game, so...

829
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,410
Oh, I should have written that, right?

830
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,170
Oh, oh, there's something really...

831
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:55,010
That I...

832
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:55,290
Here.

833
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:56,450
I came up with this idea.

834
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:02,950
If you ever see spoilers in the chat, like maybe someone
posts something that's just, like, alluding to something.

835
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,610
Or just a straight-up spoiler.

836
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:17,090
use smiley faces to get to push it off of the screen but So
that way I don't read it, but if I'm like cooking and I

837
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:26,030
maybe think of something don't use smiley faces Because then
I don't think I'm correct I'll be like Maybe I'm on to

838
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:27,470
something, you know what I mean?

839
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:30,170
Well, that's a new and novel idea, right?

840
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:31,790
Isn't it kind of genius?

841
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:37,730
I'm kind of a genius no No one else has ever thought of
that.

842
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:38,170
Ever.

843
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:42,950
I'm a genius, dao.

844
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,680
Frowning for cooking.

845
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:53,780
Ray, huh?

846
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,940
So you aren't going to tell me your real name?

847
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:56,840
I take it.

848
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,340
You haven't told me your name yet?

849
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,220
Or actually.

850
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,860
I'm Mr. Trick.

851
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,560
I'm Mr. Ghost Trick.

852
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,480
I can't remember.

853
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:09,320
Yes, I guess the memories of the newly departed tend to get
a bit confused.

854
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:12,660
Some of us get our memories back.

855
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,100
Others never do.

856
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:15,080
No, I'm Minto.

857
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,220
But if you ask me, does it really matter?

858
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:19,860
Spoiler.

859
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,580
Mint cute.

860
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,760
That's the worst spoiler of them all.

861
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,380
After all, there's only one path left to the dead.

862
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,380
And that is, to disappear.

863
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:36,860
Disappear?

864
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,620
Ban that guy.

865
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,500
When the sun rises in the morning, I'm afraid you're going
to cease to exist!

866
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,720
So soon?

867
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:47,800
What?

868
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:48,680
Tomorrow morning?

869
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,200
Hmm.

870
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:51,460
Wait a minute.

871
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,040
These powers of the dead.

872
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:54,260
Yes?

873
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,380
What about fake-out spoilers?

874
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:01,060
Spoilers that are wrong or misleading so you don't know what
spoilers in chat are real.

875
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,020
Um...

876
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,660
I understand.

877
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,400
I understand the intent.

878
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,240
But other people might get confused too.

879
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,580
And I'd rather...

880
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,440
And I, I don't know.

881
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,760
I don't want anything fake spoilers, you know?

882
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,040
So it's like...

883
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,980
Unless it's like overly jokie, you know?

884
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:20,780
Yeah.

885
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,660
So just, uh...

886
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:22,900
Yeah.

887
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,480
We'll just not do any spoilers at all.

888
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,760
Mint is actually Patrick Swayze.

889
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:33,710
Oh, my darling.

890
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:38,390
I long for your touch.

891
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:40,010
Pottery.

892
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:41,750
Pottery.

893
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,550
I'd like to use them to save somebody else's life.

894
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:47,850
And whose life might that be?

895
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:49,350
I don't know, grandma.

896
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:50,650
She's going to cross the street.

897
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:52,570
Doesn't realize a truck is coming.

898
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:54,770
It's meant to secretly...

899
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:55,390
Big bow.

900
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,210
But, er, dies off screen.

901
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:01,490
Do you even have to ask?

902
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:02,810
Mine, of course.

903
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:04,670
Oh, I see.

904
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:06,990
Two, thank you.

905
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:09,790
I'm actually a lamp.

906
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,990
Ray of Light Mac.

907
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:17,810
I have Light Mac!

908
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:18,790
Oh my gosh.

909
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:20,990
Metal Gear Ray of Light Mac.

910
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:24,510
But think about it this way.

911
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:29,570
If we could use ghost tricks to save ourselves, wouldn't I
have tried to save myself as well?

912
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:30,910
I mean, look at me.

913
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:32,070
I'm a desk lamp.

914
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,730
But also, why didn't you disappear?

915
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:38,150
Can we save the desk lamp then?

916
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:44,650
Because if the desk lamp is still here, why haven't we?

917
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:47,310
Wait, how long have they been around for?

918
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,090
I was only half-hearted least.

919
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:49,490
Spoiler?

920
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:51,030
Okay, no, stop.

921
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:56,830
Why a desk lamp, anyway?

922
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:00,130
I'm not really sure myself, to be honest.

923
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:05,290
But in any case, it seems we are unable to use our powers on
our own corpses.

924
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,530
Time to go find our little desk friend.

925
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:08,630
You're kidding!

926
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:11,690
You only exist in this world until tomorrow morning.

927
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,950
How do you even know that?

928
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:23,470
fact can't be changed so there's really no escaping my own
death okay desk lamp why also did you not try to save me in

929
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:29,110
the morning I'm going to cease to exist apparently there's
nothing I can do to change that but just the same I still

930
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:38,650
want to know I want to know my story the lost story of my
fate right up until the time of my death until I learn that

931
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:50,870
you won't be able to rest in peace right yeah very well i
understand how you feel you want to go and learn the truth

932
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:59,290
about your death as well you should i will but let's see how
should i go about doing that i wonder i can't even imagine

933
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:04,070
what the first step would be the first step that's easy you
start with her

934
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,810
The person who witnessed your death.

935
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:17,830
She should have some important clues, don't you think?

936
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:19,250
She's so cute.

937
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:20,390
Hey, you're right.

938
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:21,710
Not only that.

939
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:24,450
She might even know who I am.

940
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:25,390
Tascaru.

941
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:29,770
Yes, I'd say there's a very good possibility of that.

942
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:33,530
What was I doing here tonight in a place like this?

943
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:36,190
That woman probably knows the answer.

944
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:37,570
Hi, Minto.

945
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,150
Hello, hello, hello.

946
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:40,510
That's right.

947
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:41,690
Never forget that.

948
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:44,470
She is the key to everything tonight.

949
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:46,730
The key to everything?

950
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:47,810
What do you mean?

951
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:51,710
You'll know soon enough when you regain your memory.

952
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,170
Yeah, I'm like a baby.

953
00:56:58,430 --> 00:56:59,310
I'm like a newborn baby.

954
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:01,250
I'm like a blank sheet of paper right now.

955
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:05,570
I should probably keep some sort of record of everything I
learned tonight.

956
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:07,810
That's a very good idea.

957
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:11,930
Press Z-O to view...

958
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:21,290
record of what you've learned and be sure to check it out
now and then okay memories aren't always the most reliable

959
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:36,910
things after all my court record phone book all right then i
wish you good luck trick time so if we go to our

960
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:44,870
oh me the mystery Red-headed target.

961
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:46,370
Oh no, come on.

962
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:48,290
Why would you mute her sneeze?

963
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:50,090
Ray of light.

964
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:51,890
Hunter in the dark.

965
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:53,790
He calls himself nearsighted Gigo.

966
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:00,450
But he's gone now due to an unfortunate accident.

967
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:03,130
I kind of miss him, not gonna lie.

968
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:08,090
I lost my life at a lonely spot on the outskirts of town.

969
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:08,630
What?

970
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:11,130
Yeah, an accident.

971
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:14,290
Saved her with my powers of the dead.

972
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:18,230
He taught me the secrets.

973
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:19,830
Okay.

974
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:22,650
I'm going ghost!

975
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:24,830
Shoo, shoo!

976
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:26,930
Uh...

977
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:29,950
If I trick...

978
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,360
I better not let her out of my sight.

979
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,280
And besides, I'm not the kind of guy who can just let a
woman sit sneezing in the cold rain.

980
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,200
I think I'll try to move closer.

981
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:41,700
Yeah, yeah.

982
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,220
That's what I'm trying to do, yes.

983
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,090
Oh, shimmy!

984
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:50,820
Shimmy, shimmy.

985
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,240
There we go.

986
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:55,920
Nice.

987
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,800
She's still sneezing.

988
00:58:58,920 --> 00:58:59,540
Wait, how can I...

989
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,040
There she is.

990
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,200
She's just...

991
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,780
She's still sneezing in the rain.

992
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,020
Trying to get closer to you.

993
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,420
Yeah.

994
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,580
I'm going ghost.

995
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,320
Oh, we can give her the umbrella.

996
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,740
That's so cute.

997
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,060
Oh, it's a miracle.

998
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,230
What in the world just happened?

999
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:30,570
The crane moved all by itself, and then that big iron ball
fell all by itself.

1000
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:31,990
It started raining.

1001
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:33,550
Well, that's just how the weather goes.

1002
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:34,950
That's just how the weather works.

1003
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:39,670
It started raining all by itself, and then an umbrella came
down all by itself.

1004
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:41,850
Oh my goodness.

1005
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:45,230
Don't tell me I have psychokinetic powers.

1006
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:47,110
Yes.

1007
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:49,850
You are the chosen one.

1008
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,040
You guys, I almost bought Arona's...

1009
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,600
Someone was selling Arona's umbrella on Mercari.

1010
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,980
And it was really expensive, so I didn't buy it, but I
thought about it.

1011
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,220
I was like, I should buy this.

1012
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,620
It's expensive, but it's cool.

1013
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,420
A cat!

1014
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,220
Best game...

1015
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,480
Oh, best game ever!

1016
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,360
Oh.

1017
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:19,700
Okay.

1018
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,000
I disrespect my body like that.

1019
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,080
My Lupon looking ass.

1020
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,840
But then it sold out and I was so sad.

1021
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:34,040
Oh, looks like she's saying something to herself.

1022
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,500
But unfortunately I can't hear from here.

1023
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,860
Oh, that's no problem for a ghost like us as long as your
target's not too far away.

1024
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,600
Just like you do with your own thought bubbles.

1025
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,800
If you tap the thought bubbles of the living, you can listen
in on them what they're saying.

1026
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,380
Maybe I'll just take a little listen then.

1027
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,340
Always watch out, watch for the thought bubbles of the
living.

1028
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,240
They might give you some important clues.

1029
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:00,400
Seriously, what in the world just happened?

1030
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:04,300
It's me.

1031
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:04,840
Oh!

1032
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,280
What's this?

1033
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,880
Some kind of note.

1034
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:11,140
Okay.

1035
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,060
Uh.

1036
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:14,940
I want to see that note.

1037
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:16,080
I wonder what I wrote on it.

1038
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,400
It's not just a shopping list or something.

1039
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:20,840
it's not just a shopping list.

1040
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:21,580
That wouldn't help.

1041
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:22,340
Should I check it out?

1042
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,400
Okay, cool.

1043
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:24,620
Ech.

1044
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:26,900
Examine.

1045
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,880
I am now the note.

1046
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:32,540
Did I write this note?

1047
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:33,820
Maybe I should give it a read.

1048
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,680
By beating Nearsighted Jigo, you got card key one.

1049
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,020
Now you enter the base.

1050
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,720
Outer YouTube and destroy Metal Gear algorithm.

1051
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:47,420
So you don't remember writing it, eh?

1052
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,700
No, I don't remember writing it, but even more
importantly...

1053
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,680
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.

1054
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:54,320
Uh-oh.

1055
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:56,040
Uh-oh.

1056
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:57,820
Don't answer it.

1057
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,540
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1058
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:00,840
Why would you do that?

1059
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:03,860
Moshi, moshi.

1060
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,260
Uh, I didn't get a chance to read the note!

1061
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:14,380
Not to interrupt your train of thought, but I wonder if you
realized where this telephone call is coming from?

1062
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,620
How would I know that?

1063
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,800
Think back.

1064
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:22,280
Before you helped to revert her fate, Didn't a telephone
call come in around at this time too?

1065
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,540
Oh, yeah.

1066
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:25,580
No!

1067
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:26,480
Oh, my God.

1068
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,220
He's so cool going down the stairs.

1069
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,200
It's done.

1070
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,520
I'm on my way.

1071
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:37,820
No!

1072
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,740
That telephone call!

1073
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:40,700
Exactly.

1074
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:47,000
In other words, at this very moment, on the other end of
this telephone line is the culprit who ordered your murder.

1075
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:48,420
What?

1076
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:54,200
Um, I'll take a pizza or cheese.

1077
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,160
I recommend you possess the telephone.

1078
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,280
Once you've done that, I'll tell you about another one of
your ghost tricks.

1079
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:01,740
Oh my gosh, trick time!

1080
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,100
I'm going ghost.

1081
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:04,700
I'm possessing.

1082
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:06,380
And then I saw him.

1083
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,280
Right there on the other end of the line, I saw the face of
the man who ordered me dead!

1084
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,160
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited.

1085
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,000
What does he look like?

1086
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,000
He's probably so cool.

1087
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,600
He's probably so mysterious.

1088
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:28,180
No!

1089
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,000
I got killed by grandpa.

1090
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:46,960
Is it done?

1091
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:53,680
Look at this, look at this tiny guy's oversized notebook and
everything.

1092
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:55,540
He's got so many pictures of himself.

1093
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:57,860
Speak up, man.

1094
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,300
Did you get her?

1095
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:00,660
Oh.

1096
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:01,280
Yes.

1097
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,200
Who is this?

1098
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,360
Oh, yes.

1099
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:06,880
A thousand pardons, my dear lady.

1100
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,860
I must have dialed the wrong number.

1101
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,800
Ha, ha, ha.

1102
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:13,830
Oh.

1103
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:17,110
Trace complete.

1104
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:19,550
So that's him, eh?

1105
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:21,190
The man who stole my life.

1106
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:23,350
We don't know that yet, though, right?

1107
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:25,790
Bet the note says she did it.

1108
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:28,310
Probably, right?

1109
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:30,950
Hold on, I'm going to have another bite of food.

1110
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:32,610
I have to, like, pick up the plate.

1111
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:39,590
move it over and then put it back because i don't have much
room on my desk

1112
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,020
mogu no this guy was after her we don't know if he was after
you

1113
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:08,540
that's right so what do you think would you like to go see
him you better believe i would then you would do well to

1114
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:12,680
listen to me Weak ghosts exist by possessing inanimate
objects.

1115
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:19,340
However, there is one way we can move from place to place
over great distances through the phone.

1116
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:22,140
The internet, oh my gosh.

1117
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,380
Become a digital ghost.

1118
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:27,480
Become a VTuber ghost.

1119
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,260
Me.

1120
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:38,600
That would be, the dead can jump from point A to point B by
moving over phone lines.

1121
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,060
Say woo!

1122
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:44,280
I've done all I can do to help you.

1123
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,080
You'll have to do the rest yourself.

1124
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:46,840
No!

1125
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:48,620
No Ray!

1126
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,040
Don't leave!

1127
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:51,560
You're not coming with me?

1128
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,320
I'm afraid not.

1129
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,360
My powers have grown weak.

1130
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:59,260
I've already used up most of my remaining strength just to
get here tonight.

1131
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:00,960
But why?

1132
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:01,860
Why are you here?

1133
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:02,820
How do you know me?

1134
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,300
But I had to come to ask for your help.

1135
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:15,360
Always wanted to play this game, but it's on my growing
backlog so i'm happy to see you play it thanks kinky i hope

1143
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:21,400
This desk lamp knows a whole lot more than he's telling me.

1144
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:22,980
Now then.

1145
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:27,680
From what I call a moment ago, you have the culprit's
telephone number.

1146
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,280
The rest is all up to you.

1147
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,260
Oh, bing, bing.

1148
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,540
We're going here.

1149
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,400
SYS 1729.

1150
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,360
E.

1151
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Ki-mash!

1152
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:51,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1153
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:53,540
Nice.

1154
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,660
And so the story of the search for myself begins.

1155
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,440
A story that will last one night only.

1156
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,080
Tomorrow morning, I will cease to exist.

1157
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,000
And I'm surprisingly okay with this fact.

1158
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:08,780
I have to...

1159
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:11,980
I have to find the answers before the sun comes up.

1160
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,140
Why was I killed?

1161
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,560
And what exactly is going on to happen...

1162
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,580
It's going to happen in this town tonight.

1163
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:21,380
We have to haunt Dr. Weird's blue cousin.

1164
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:28,230
Oh, illustrations.

1165
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:31,170
Cleared 702 to 731 p.m.

1166
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:33,830
Music?

1167
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:35,350
Four minutes before death?

1168
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:38,110
Oh my gosh, look at him!

1169
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:40,810
Sure, we'll save.

1170
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:42,610
Save, yes.

1171
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:43,590
Continue playing.

1172
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:44,530
How long have I been?

1173
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:46,530
An hour to get through the tutorial, guys.

1174
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:47,190
Let's go!

1175
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:50,910
731 p.m.

1176
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:53,050
Who am I?

1177
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:54,290
Why was I killed?

1178
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:59,010
The one who is sure to know the answers to those questions
is the man who ordered my murder.

1179
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:07,870
At the other end of the phone line is the very man who had
me killed.

1180
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:08,930
Our meeting.

1181
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:10,130
It's all so sudden.

1182
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:11,710
Who?

1183
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:14,850
Who is that massive guy on the right?

1184
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:17,830
Mr. X?

1185
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:19,850
I'm not sure.

1186
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:21,510
really prepared for what's to come.

1187
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:22,330
Me neither.

1188
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:27,170
Whoa!

1189
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:29,630
Hmm, yes.

1190
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:38,150
If what I read in this file is true, this woman could be
quite a bedeviling bit of trouble for us.

1191
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:40,610
She needs to be erased tonight.

1192
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:45,830
Confound that near-sighted Jigo.

1193
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:48,610
His skills are as feeble as his eyesight.

1194
01:09:50,830 --> 01:10:05,270
not to worry sir I have already taken the next step sir beep
beep beep oh my gosh whoa he's hacking oh my god they

1195
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:13,270

what I say the last thing I ever expected was to talk to the

1196
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:21,810
target herself even if it was only over the telephone I must
admit to my good man it put me in quite the tizzy there for

1197
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:32,210
a moment what is this place these oddly luxurious
furnishings this oddly refined music oh no the music's

1198
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:42,310
diagenetic and that odd little machine I've never seen a
room like this before but one they they got her 3d debut

1199
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:51,890
yeah one thing's for sure these people are assassins And
what's more?

1200
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:53,010
They're blue!

1201
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:56,390
Oh, the red-headed woman is another one of their targets.

1202
01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:58,970
Strider, welcome the membership, thank you!

1203
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,010
That file the old man has.

1204
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:06,430
Maybe it'll give me some information on my red...

1205
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:08,930
My red head?

1206
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,420
Trick time!

1207
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,740
I'm going ghost!

1208
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:25,140
What's this thing?

1209
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,080
I can't reach it.

1210
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:26,460
Dang.

1211
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:28,580
Time to examine.

1212
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,040
Girl looks like a rooster.

1213
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:33,600
A very cute rooster.

1214
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,340
Like the cutest rooster.

1215
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:42,370
Seems this file contains information about that red hen.

1216
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:46,110
But I can't read it when it's closed.

1217
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:47,350
Oh, thank you.

1218
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:47,550
Oh!

1219
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:50,390
Great, Scott.

1220
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:52,370
Did you see that?

1221
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:54,310
The file, I say.

1222
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:56,410
Wait, what voice did I have for this guy?

1223
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:57,230
I can't remember.

1224
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:01,290
It sounds like maybe he's British.

1225
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:03,950
Wait.

1226
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:11,890
Yeah, the file reared up and snapped at me, my good man.

1227
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:13,810
Nearly bit my head off.

1228
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:16,530
Not to worry, sir.

1229
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:20,070
I've already seen to it that the target Miss...

1230
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:21,050
Miss Lynn.

1231
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:23,230
Is no longer a threat, sir.

1232
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:24,810
Yes, my darkness.

1233
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:28,390
Bah, that's not what I'm talking about, man.

1234
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:31,270
Glasses out for nearsighted Jiro.

1235
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:34,390
Hmm, Lynn, eh?

1236
01:12:34,910 --> 01:12:36,130
So that's her name, is it?

1237
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:38,790
But this file.

1238
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:42,690
It's like it's written in a foreign language.

1239
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:44,570
Oh no, we forgot how to read.

1240
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:46,390
I can't read it at all.

1241
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:49,890
Might I suggest putting away the file in relaxing, sir?

1242
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:53,730
Beep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep.

1243
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:55,430
Oh my god, we're gonna watch V-Tubers!

1244
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:56,470
Oh.

1245
01:12:57,650 --> 01:12:58,050
Shoo!

1246
01:12:58,590 --> 01:12:59,110
Whoa!

1247
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:01,690
This place is so fancy.

1248
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:03,830
Peep peep peep peep peep peep peep.

1249
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,140
That's so cool.

1250
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,380
It turns back into the chandelier.

1251
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:12,200
Wow!

1252
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,160
You have a very important job ahead of you tonight, sir.

1253
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:20,360
Oh, yummy.

1254
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:21,960
I'm gonna possess the grapes.

1255
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:23,340
Dang it.

1256
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:25,940
No war tonight, everybody.

1257
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:27,960
Let's see.

1258
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,360
Projector!

1259
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:31,060
Lamp.

1260
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,420
Let's operate this thing.

1261
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:37,980
Darn.

1262
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,020
This is a pickle?

1263
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:41,780
No, those are grapes.

1264
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,260
The phone and I got put away neatly.

1265
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,900
The only thing I've learned is that the name is the name
Lin.

1266
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:49,900
This sure is a weird room.

1267
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,660
Travel through the...

1268
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:56,660
Travel through the phone line to get here.

1269
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,640
But where exactly is here?

1270
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,980
And who exactly are these people?

1271
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,180
Boo!

1272
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,520
Oh, you like it?

1273
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,340
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1274
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:08,860
Boo, yes, boo.

1275
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:11,380
Am I lagging by the way sometimes?

1276
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:12,260
I can't tell.

1277
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:15,160
Eagat, man.

1278
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,780
What are you trying to give me a case of the vapors?

1279
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:21,600
My apologies, sir, but I did not touch it, sir.

1280
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:26,160
It appears the equipment is still malfunctioning, sir.

1281
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:30,480
Bah, granted, technology is...

1282
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:33,060
Granted, technology is certainly a convenient thing.

1283
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:47,370
I'm smooth but our use of it is just plain off confounded
hmm yes in any case I don't wish to see the face of our

1284
01:14:47,370 --> 01:15:00,230
current target to my good man as you wish sir in that case
might I suggest this sir it changes to oh my gosh I was

1285
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:03,070
thinking It changes to like a mint phantom stream.

1286
01:15:04,190 --> 01:15:05,210
Might I suggest this, sir?

1287
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:07,750
Peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, opens up VTuber's stream.

1288
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:14,420
Hey, that's...

1289
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:15,380
Hmm, yes.

1290
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:16,620
Cicil?

1291
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:26,420
If all goes well with our deal tonight, we will have the
power to change the world, sir.

1292
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,120
Yes, sir.

1293
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,080
Yes.

1294
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:33,300
It's a very important night indeed, my good man.

1295
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,240
to make mistakes.

1296
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:37,020
Sissel.

1297
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,920
And that is why we can't afford to trust that sissel.

1298
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,820
No, we must be very careful.

1299
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,300
John Sissel ghost trick.

1300
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:49,700
Sissel.

1301
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:52,560
That must be my name.

1302
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,600
Now that I hear it, it does sound familiar.

1303
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,120
A deal, eh?

1304
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:59,200
What could that be all about?

1305
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,940
So what exactly was I up to, I wonder?

1306
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,460
No, sir.

1307
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:09,920
Yes, sir.

1308
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:12,060
Thank you for the no, sir.

1309
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:16,480
We are completely prepared for tonight, sir.

1310
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:23,620
Yes.

1311
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,940
Now all we have to do is pluck the fruit of success.

1312
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:32,880
One thing's clear.

1313
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,840
These villains seem to know me.

1314
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:36,180
Infinite graves.

1315
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:37,460
I wish.

1316
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:49,520
reality and another thing there seems to be some kind of
connection between me and this Lin why else would our names

1317
01:16:49,520 --> 01:17:06,320
both come up here like this mmm going ghost I'm going lamp
can't I guess we gotta oh wait I can't reach oh curse this

1318
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,480
tiny wispy body of mine.

1319
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,360
Okay, let's just operate the lamp again.

1320
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,360
Or the projector.

1321
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:17,420
Where was your head, man?

1322
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:19,540
I told you I don't wish to see this face.

1323
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:21,140
My apology, sir.

1324
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,400
It appears to be another malfunction, sir.

1325
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,280
Well, get it fixed.

1326
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:27,860
Man, unless you want to see me malfunction.

1327
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:29,600
Certainly, sir.

1328
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,120
I'm gonna make this guy go crazy.

1329
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:41,040
These guys murdered me And now they're targeting the
redhead.

1330
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,000
What kind of connection do we have with each other?

1331
01:17:50,650 --> 01:17:52,570
Spinning this painting around makes the old man head spin.

1332
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:53,510
But that's about it.

1333
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:55,770
Got to find the right timing and get...

1334
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:56,150
Oh!

1335
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:05,590
When it spins...

1336
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:06,910
Oh, I can possess the painting.

1337
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:07,790
Okay, okay, okay.

1338
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:10,050
Okay, okay.

1339
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:10,730
I got it.

1340
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:13,490
There we go.

1341
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:15,350
First try, baby.

1342
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:16,330
Okay.

1345
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:49,340

with paintings spinning around and the like it's enough to

1346
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:51,200
give Amanda jitters.

1347
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:52,760
My apologies, sir.

1348
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,840
The room was just completed recently, sir.

1349
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:57,600
We're still trying to iron out the kinks, sir.

1350
01:18:58,780 --> 01:18:59,300
Yes.

1351
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:01,360
I just hope that's all it is.

1352
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:02,100
Ha ha.

1353
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,300
Little do they know.

1354
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:10,780
I'm causing chaos in their workplace.

1355
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,880
Get your heads out of the gutter.

1356
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,120
Get your heads out of the gutter.

1357
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:21,620
gutter.

1358
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:31,410
I mean, e-gad, man.

1359
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:34,970
How am I supposed to relax and enjoy my grapes?

1360
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:38,810
So true.

1361
01:19:39,770 --> 01:19:40,830
Okay, we can operate that.

1362
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:43,630
We can become fruit.

1363
01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:45,650
Look, we're just little fruit.

1364
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:47,950
Oh no, he's gonna eat us for real.

1365
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:48,670
Okay.

1366
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:50,810
Let's operate this now.

1367
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:53,890
Trick!

1368
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:55,750
Trick!

1369
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,700
Goodbye, Fruit.

1370
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:06,260
It's a miserable state of affairs when I can't even be
startled by a telephone that doesn't even ring.

1371
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:07,980
Ah, e-gad!

1372
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,400
Become Fruit.

1373
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:15,220
It's even more pathetic to be startled by the same telephone
twice.

1374
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:15,980
Bah!

1375
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,480
The problem must be solved, sir.

1376
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,760
Dismiss Lynn problems, sir.

1377
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:21,880
What?

1378
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:22,680
Lynn?

1379
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:25,120
Hmm, yes.

1380
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:28,180
You did mention taking the next step a moment ago.

1381
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,600
Didn't you mind, good man?

1382
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:31,340
You were saying.

1383
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:32,680
Yes, sir.

1384
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:33,980
I sent one step ahead...

1385
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:36,040
Wait, one step ahead, Tango.

1386
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:43,740
So we had near-sighted Jenga and now one step ahead, Tango.

1387
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,100
So that's what he meant by being one step ahead.

1388
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,400
A telephone...

1389
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,180
Oh, that telephone call must be here.

1390
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:13,300

fish it only stands with reason oh it's a reason if the

1393
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:48,220

you've taken care of her then you'll promote me to the head

1395
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:00,040
of the Hitman division.

1396
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,800
Bah, no, man.

1397
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,820
You're even getting one step ahead of me.

1398
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,140
We can discuss my new salary later.

1399
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:09,000
Great, Scott.

1400
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:12,280
Now you're even getting one step ahead of your last one step
ahead.

1401
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:14,320
This guy's so ambitious.

1402
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:14,920
We love it.

1403
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,360
We love a guy, boss.

1404
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:17,840
Girl boss?

1405
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,700
I'll get back to my job now, sir.

1406
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:22,120
Confounded.

1407
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:24,460
You're even hanging up all on step ahead.

1408
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:28,000
Yes, girl boss, that promotion.

1409
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:28,920
Yes!

1410
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:36,510
What did he say, sir?

1411
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:39,970
He asked me to raise his salary.

1412
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:42,670
This game is so goofy.

1413
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:45,150
What will you do, sir?

1414
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:49,250
Maybe I'll give him some of nearsighted g- oh gigo!

1415
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,330
Oh, a dango and gigo.

1416
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:57,090
I called him uh, I called him uh, I called him jango, I
think.

1417
01:22:59,190 --> 01:23:00,410
Gigo, gigo, gigo.

1418
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:01,570
That makes sense.

1419
01:23:01,630 --> 01:23:04,250
G go, G go, 10 go.

1420
01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:08,910
I go, we go, G go, 10 go.

1421
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:12,310
One go, two go, blue go, red go.

1422
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:14,790
Near-sighted ahead, Jankum.

1423
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:19,590
Lynn, I can't lose her.

1424
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:22,630
She's my only lead if I ever hope to solve the mystery of
me.

1425
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:25,470
Ah, here we go.

1426
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:29,390
Oh my gosh, we're going to her apartment.

1427
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:31,970
How exciting.

1428
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:38,140
Jigoku and Tengoku?

1429
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,810
Oh, that's so...

1430
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:46,600
He did not kill the dog.

1431
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:50,500
Did he kill the dog?

1432
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:00,340
No!

1433
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:03,920
No!

1434
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:11,300
The telephone line guided me to Lin's apartment.

1435
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:14,800
Unfortunately, Lynn isn't here yet, but unfortunately, the
Hitman is.

1436
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:22,900
Oh my gosh, she's got, like, giant, giant, like, what are
those cheesy rings and a bowl?

1437
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:29,520
And there are a couple of other unfortunate little
developments waiting for me, it seems.

1438
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:32,980
No, oh, who is that?

1439
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:34,040
Oh my gosh, what?

1440
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:39,140
Hmm, it looks like there's an unlikely, unlucky little lady
here tonight.

1441
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:41,860
lady.

1442
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,920
I didn't even unlock here, little doggy.

1443
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:48,460
No, no, no, no, no.

1444
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,920
A poor brave little warrior.

1445
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:51,520
We'll save him.

1446
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:52,140
We'll save him, though.

1447
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:52,720
We'll save him.

1448
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,740
He must have been trying to defend his mistress.

1449
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:57,540
No.

1450
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:00,500
Not the dog.

1451
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,980
If Lynn came home now, I have to do something about the
situation and fast.

1452
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,180
Can we go back in time and save the dog?

1453
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:15,540
I think we can.

1454
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:20,900
Where am I?

1455
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,520
And more to the point, who am I?

1456
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:25,000
Oh, wait, the dog can talk?

1457
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:27,540
Who am I?

1458
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:29,580
Well, are you talking to me?

1459
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:30,800
Of course.

1460
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:32,160
Do you see anybody else around here?

1461
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:34,940
If I remember right, the dead don't have voices.

1462
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:36,920
Their thoughts reach the other person directly.

1463
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:39,260
Oof, oof, roof.

1464
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:43,880
explains why this dog is talking to me right now.

1465
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:50,140
This is your mistress's apartment, and you are presumably
the little doggy who died here.

1466
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:51,280
Died?

1467
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,220
So I'm dead, woof?

1468
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:54,840
Let's see.

1469
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:56,200
The dead lose their memories.

1470
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:58,180
They even forget what they look like.

1471
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:01,440
And so that's what this blue flame shape is all about.

1472
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:02,940
Oh, woof!

1473
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,880
There's no time to lose, woof!

1474
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:09,780
Miss Camilla!

1475
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:31,040
My Miss Camilla is in trouble woof oh you mean you remember
you know who you are oh that's right I'm Missa Missa nice to

1476
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:43,820
meet you I'm a Pomeranian woof Wow I guess now I know it's
possible for the dead to regain their memories Missa thanks

1477
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:45,160
to this little doggy.

1478
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:46,860
Miss Camilla!

1479
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:48,520
Miss Camilla!

1480
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:56,740
My Miss Camilla is in trouble and I vowed to devote my life
to protecting her, wolf!

1481
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,100
Oh my gosh, pretty!

1482
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,460
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

1483
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:01,480
Thank you so much!

1484
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:02,080
Thank you!

1485
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,380
But I died before I could rescue her.

1486
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:07,200
How could I let her down like this, wolf?

1487
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:12,740
So you're more worried about your mistress' safety than your
own death, eh?

1488
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:15,420
I like your moxie, little doggy.

1489
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,700
Looks like it's time to go back to four minutes before this
little guy's death.

1490
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,700
This time to save...

1491
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:23,160
Time to save this...

1492
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:23,300
Wait.

1493
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:25,920
Time...

1494
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,280
That's not me, right?

1495
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:28,500
Time to save...

1496
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:30,600
This...

1497
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,060
His...

1498
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:31,400
Life.

1499
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:38,120
Time to save this his life!

1500
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:42,220
Updated the phone book.

1501
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:44,960
Rewind.

1502
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:56,100
And I saw that I could open up the door of the door we
possessed right before possessing the Maison de Amida.

1503
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:57,900
Let's see.

1504
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:01,680
First of all, I'd better see what I can find out before your
death, little guy.

1505
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,780
Excuse me, but...

1506
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:04,680
Where exactly are we?

1507
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:05,560
Huh?

1508
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:07,420
You follow me?

1509
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:09,580
I followed you.

1510
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:10,860
You brought me with you.

1511
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:11,980
One or the other.

1512
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:13,060
Hmm.

1513
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,860
It looks like the dead can move around together.

1514
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:15,980
Hmm.

1515
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:21,200
This is the land of four minutes before your death Really
we're really here?

1516
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,820
So that means you're going to save Miss Camilla, doesn't it?

1517
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:29,240
Missile both in ghost trick and an ace attorney is based on
Shue Takumi's Shiba.

1518
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,120
He passed away a few years ago.

1519
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:37,180
Oh no Aww So the dog was name is Nikita or Stinger?

1520
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,880
Looks like a Nikita to me, right?

1521
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:42,760
Missile

1522
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,360
I mean, we just traveled through time, and not especially.

1523
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:53,180
I mean, Miss Camilla can walk around on two legs, but I
can't do that.

1524
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:57,660
So if she can do that, then it's not so strange that you can
walk backwards through time.

1525
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,300
So that's the way your mind works, eh?

1526
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,160
I guess that's reasonable enough.

1527
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:04,520
Sorry.

1528
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:07,580
Come on, come on, let's get started.

1529
01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:08,360
Oof.

1530
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:12,140
First, we watch your last four minutes unfold.

1531
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:14,140
Then we use what we learn to save Camilla.

1532
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,700
Just like when I saved Lynn at the junkyard.

1533
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,120
If we watch closely, we ought to be able to get a few leads.

1534
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:22,300
Keep your eyes open.

1535
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:24,040
Of course.

1536
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:25,480
Woof!

1537
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:28,200
Leave it to me to sniff out of you clues.

1538
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:29,080
Woof!

1539
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:31,020
Okay.

1540
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:34,700
Oh, she's under the couch for some reason.

1541
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:36,980
She's so cute.

1542
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:38,380
Yippee!

1543
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:39,460
I found the remote!

1544
01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:43,900
Oh, that is so...

1545
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:45,420
How are you able to watch anything?

1546
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:54,760
is doing what the gay oh who the heck is that oh my shut
that mud up

1547
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:16,180
no missile you're not supposed to bark the art here
particularly reminds me of poppin the lady next door is

1548
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:21,580
crappier than ever tonight If it barks again.

1549
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:24,180
Oh, knock this wall down.

1550
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,040
Kind of Mega Man.

1551
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:32,440
Maybe very pop and mention.

1552
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:35,140
Lady hate.

1553
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:35,680
Yeah.

1554
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:36,980
Lady hate.

1555
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:39,760
Yeah, who's going to pay?

1556
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:43,020
I don't think knocking the wall down is going to solve your
problems.

1557
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:44,540
I think it's going to make it even worse.

1558
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:50,920
Actually, Ace Attorney Missile came before, then Shue
Takumi's Missile, then Ghost Trick Missile.

1559
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:56,140
Whoever sent the super chat before, you got, um, actually.

1560
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,920
You don't want her to knock the wall down, do you, boy?

1561
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:06,780
Why do you like to bark so much anyway?

1562
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:10,900
Um, actually.

1563
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:17,540
You sure are cute.

1564
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,180
But just don't get us killed, okay?

1565
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:22,600
Ish.

1566
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:24,240
Darn.

1567
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:25,960
I really wanted to watch TV, too.

1568
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:27,580
Hey, I know.

1569
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:28,520
I'll listen to music.

1570
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:31,380
Oh, no.

1571
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:36,100
That's why she probably couldn't hear the guy who, uh...

1572
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:37,940
Okay, so we're gonna have to...

1573
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:38,360
Oh.

1574
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:39,900
That was close.

1575
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:44,020
We're gonna have to knock her music into the water so that
she can't hear.

1576
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:45,660
Or so she can't listen.

1577
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:47,660
Because otherwise she's gonna miss the guy.

1578
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:49,540
I'm in the mood for donuts tonight.

1579
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:52,460
Look at the tail.

1580
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:56,980
It's just like her.

1581
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:57,960
It's like her hair.

1582
01:31:58,600 --> 01:31:59,160
Oh, no, no.

1583
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:00,020
What?

1584
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:00,780
Oh, my gosh.

1585
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,340
Do we have a rat infestation?

1586
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:03,120
Uh-oh.

1587
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:04,140
He's gonna bark.

1588
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:04,980
Oh, no!

1589
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:11,260
I'll knock this wall down.

1590
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:13,660
Oh, my God.

1591
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:14,780
This is so bad.

1592
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:16,380
Remy.

1593
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:18,760
Oh.

1594
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:20,820
Why?

1595
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,340
Why has he got, like, a scope like...

1596
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:28,940
I don't really like it when jobs outside the original scope
crop up.

1597
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,280
I have to put it down as a separate charge, and accounting
never likes that.

1598
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,140
Oh my god, point blank.

1599
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:38,120
But I guess it can't be helped.

1600
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:39,180
Sorry, kid.

1601
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:42,380
I'm...

1602
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:43,240
Did it show anything?

1603
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:44,040
I closed my...

1604
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:51,330
Did it show anything because I closed my eyes.

1605
01:32:51,430 --> 01:32:52,110
I couldn't watch.

1606
01:32:52,570 --> 01:32:53,370
It faded to white?

1607
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:54,030
Okay, good.

1608
01:32:55,090 --> 01:32:55,890
Oh my god.

1609
01:32:56,490 --> 01:32:59,950
So that's the whole dramatic story of what happened four
minutes before you died.

1610
01:33:01,850 --> 01:33:02,690
Wow, look at that.

1611
01:33:02,970 --> 01:33:03,430
I'm dead.

1612
01:33:04,050 --> 01:33:05,110
Kind of shocked to tell the truth.

1613
01:33:06,690 --> 01:33:08,030
Okay, let's get started on saving her.

1614
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:08,250
One.

1615
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:10,290
Let's see.

1616
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:11,730
How are we going to do this?

1617
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:16,050
Seems to me the easiest way would be for you to take a big
bite out of that man's leg.

1618
01:33:17,010 --> 01:33:18,230
I don't think I could do that.

1619
01:33:20,110 --> 01:33:23,810
Whenever somebody I don't know comes around, all I wanna say
to them is, welcome.

1620
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:26,710
I can't help it.

1621
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:30,150
This dog is so cute.

1622
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:31,990
What a good boy.

1623
01:33:32,410 --> 01:33:33,670
Who's that good boy?

1624
01:33:34,010 --> 01:33:34,990
Who's that good boy?

1625
01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:41,670
Okay, then I guess the only thing we can do is get the
little lady to help herself somehow.

1626
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:43,870
I don't think she could do that.

1627
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:46,750
Did you notice her putting those red things on her head?

1628
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:48,750
Oh, you mean the headphones.

1629
01:33:49,670 --> 01:33:51,850
Whenever she puts those red things on, that's it.

1630
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:54,090
I can call her name until my throat is sore.

1631
01:33:55,090 --> 01:34:05,250
hears me that is very dangerous I feel so much anxiety if I
because you know how like most earbuds nowadays have what's

1632
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:18,830
the word like the you can do noise cancelling and then you
can do where you have the the it's it's where you can hear

1633
01:34:18,830 --> 01:34:20,550
the the world as well

1634
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:26,830
Transparency make a transparent mode.

1635
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:32,330
Hmm pass-through something like that I guess it depends on
what earbuds you have ambient mode.

1636
01:34:32,450 --> 01:34:41,330
I think mine is called ambient mode But yeah, if I'm not in
ambient mode, I get so much anxiety Because it's like I only

1637
01:34:41,330 --> 01:34:48,010
have I only do noise cancelling on planes But girl didn't
even hear a gunshot.

1638
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:52,010
I know that's what I'm saying To be perfectly honest.

1639
01:34:52,210 --> 01:34:55,630
I hate those red things Hmm You're right.

1640
01:34:56,270 --> 01:34:59,690
With those headphones on, our little lady doesn't even hear
the sound of the intruder's gun.

1641
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:01,970
So maybe that's our first lead.

1642
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:04,070
Now we know we have to do something.

1643
01:35:04,110 --> 01:35:05,550
Oh, we have to do something about that.

1644
01:35:07,050 --> 01:35:08,090
Yes, yes.

1645
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:11,010
Oh, I'm scared.

1646
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:11,970
I'm nervous.

1647
01:35:13,590 --> 01:35:14,530
Trick time.

1648
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:15,650
I'm going ghost.

1649
01:35:16,170 --> 01:35:16,410
All right.

1650
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:18,150
Open the door.

1651
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:21,590
Oh, we can extend it.

1652
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:23,470
Extend.

1653
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:25,070
Dang.

1654
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:35,290
it doesn't uh retract maybe oh so close you almost knocked
those red things down i think you're on to something there

1655
01:35:35,290 --> 01:35:41,850
if we drop them in the fish tank z i said earlier we gotta
drop them in the fish tank hmm camilla won't be able to use

1656
01:35:41,850 --> 01:35:47,950
them anymore but if we drop them in the fish tank miss
camilla will get a scolding from miss lynn all you have to

1657
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:59,450
do is pretend it was your fault that's the way of the
honorable warrior okay 180 i Are you calling me stupid?

1658
01:36:04,810 --> 01:36:05,530
180 IQ?

1659
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,090
Like a genome soldier?

1660
01:36:08,770 --> 01:36:09,810
Are you calling me dumb?

1661
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:22,600
180 is good though.

1662
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:23,300
I don't know.

1663
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:25,520
I played Metal Gear.

1664
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:31,300
You've obviously never seen Miss Lynn when she gets mad.

1665
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:34,580
I think she'll understand if, uh, let's see.

1666
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:36,020
We have a telephone.

1667
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:38,720
What happens if I open this?

1668
01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:45,230
I think the dog is barking.

1669
01:36:46,350 --> 01:36:46,610
Hmm.

1670
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:50,630
There's nothing else I can reach though.

1671
01:36:52,990 --> 01:36:54,870
If I extend it again...

1672
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:57,730
Uh...

1673
01:36:58,830 --> 01:37:01,170
Oh wait, okay, I saw the check mark.

1674
01:37:01,390 --> 01:37:02,050
Um, I see.

1675
01:37:09,610 --> 01:37:10,050
Hmm.

1676
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:15,570
Is there any...

1677
01:37:21,350 --> 01:37:22,470
Can I dial?

1678
01:37:24,190 --> 01:37:25,150
Oh, that's funny.

1679
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:26,410
Wait, what's wrong?

1680
01:37:27,030 --> 01:37:28,710
This telephone doesn't seem to be working right now.

1681
01:37:29,070 --> 01:37:31,390
Usually the telephone line glows red, but it's dark right
now.

1682
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:35,150
Looks like I can't use the telephone line in the four
minutes before death row.

1683
01:37:35,290 --> 01:37:35,450
Okay.

1684
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:37,150
Eh.

1685
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:39,070
Hmm.

1686
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:44,700
Hold fast forward through already read dialogue, by the way.

1687
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:45,360
Oh, thank you.

1688
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,420
You literally called yourself stupid at the start of the
stream?

1689
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:48,900
Tehepero?

1690
01:37:59,430 --> 01:38:01,010
There's stuff over there!

1691
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:02,990
I want to see it.

1692
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:03,690
Hold on.

1693
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,860
This is where she says you're not supposed to bark.

1694
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:13,420
Um...

1695
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:16,660
Do I just keep trying?

1696
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:17,700
No.

1697
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,080
It's not gonna work.

1698
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:21,640
Hmm.

1699
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:23,360
I can't get close to anything.

1700
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:27,160
This is where she says...

1701
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:28,140
Oh, no, I didn't mean to!

1702
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:29,820
I pressed X instead of Y.

1703
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:32,260
How do I fast forward?

1704
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:34,260
Oh, there we go.

1705
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:34,800
Nice.

1706
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:36,860
See what she says?

1707
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:42,500
Well, maybe we have to time it when she listens to the
music, right?

1708
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:44,860
So...

1709
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:47,720
Maybe when she grabs it, we extend it.

1710
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:54,860
We knock it out of her hands.

1711
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:56,020
Time is passing.

1712
01:38:58,240 --> 01:38:58,800
Nice.

1713
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:00,600
There we go.

1714
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:02,780
Oh, no!

1715
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:03,940
Darn!

1716
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:06,640
How did I manage to do that?

1717
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:10,100
Lynn just bought those headphones, too.

1718
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:11,620
Wrecked.

1719
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:14,300
Whoopsie.

1720
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:17,220
How about if we tell her you did it, Missile?

1721
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:23,660
Everybody 07 for this honorable warrior taking the fall.

1722
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:25,860
Missile.

1723
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:32,540
soul your your fall will not be in vain

1724
01:39:43,810 --> 01:39:53,650
oof oof time now I can't even listen to music either I think
the gods are playing tricks on me tonight forgive me miss

1725
01:39:53,650 --> 01:39:55,990
Camilla I'm only doing it to save you

1726
01:39:59,210 --> 01:40:01,930
mmm so what now you think you're one of the gods, eh?

1727
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:03,730
I'm a god.

1728
01:40:05,210 --> 01:40:06,770
I'm a god!

1729
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:08,710
Huh?

1730
01:40:09,050 --> 01:40:09,270
No.

1731
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:10,750
Never mind that.

1732
01:40:13,110 --> 01:40:15,390
The important thing is we managed to change the situation.

1733
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:16,430
Sorry, I'm, like, chewing.

1734
01:40:17,330 --> 01:40:18,050
That's true.

1735
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:22,370
At least we can now use the little lady's ears to help us.

1736
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:24,890
DJ Cat, welcome to membership.

1737
01:40:25,230 --> 01:40:25,590
Thank you!

1738
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:28,250
Oh, we got more time.

1739
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:39,860
mood for donuts tonight

1740
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:54,120
hello the question is what do we do now yeah meo jam welcome
to membership thank you unless we do something more the

1741
01:40:54,120 --> 01:41:03,840
outcome will still be the same if only I had a big strong
teeth and an aggressive spirit the god of maids doesn't it

1742
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:09,980
seem like we can stop the hidden man from coming in so yeah
Um, do you not lock your doors?

1743
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:12,280
I have an idea.

1744
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:14,900
Why don't we hide Miss Camilla?

1745
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:17,020
Hide, huh?

1746
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:21,300
That sounds just like the kind of idea a little doggy would
come up with.

1747
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:23,020
Are you making fun of me?

1748
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:26,540
But where could a little lady hide in this room?

1749
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:30,060
We have the Christmas tree, we have under the couch.

1750
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,340
I think I might have just the place.

1751
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:34,220
But there's just one little problem.

1752
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:37,400
How to get Miss Camilla in there, right?

1753
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,060
Oh, sorry.

1754
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:42,640
My friend Emody is playing Mario.

1755
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:44,360
Exactly.

1756
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:47,420
If I could possess Camilla herself, the answer would be
easy.

1757
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:51,980
But I can't do that, so I guess the only way to do it is to
lead her here.

1758
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:56,200
Now, what can I do using the objects in this room?

1759
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:59,340
I think I'll try out various things and see what I can come
up with.

1760
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:02,100
And I'll be here watching, cheering you on.

1761
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,280
Okay, now we can possess this.

1762
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:07,580
We can rock the bowl.

1763
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:10,620
Let's rock the bull.

1764
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:12,960
Oh, wee.

1765
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:16,800
Time is passing.

1766
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:31,980
I'm sorry, little mouse.

1767
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:34,780
Ah, sorry.

1768
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:36,160
I just unplugged my controller.

1769
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:37,180
There we go.

1770
01:42:38,180 --> 01:42:39,280
Because I thought it was...

1771
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:41,180
I was charging it while I was playing.

1772
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:42,840
Okay.

1773
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:44,640
Sorry.

1774
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,040
Stop the dog from barking, though, right?

1775
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:49,860
Move!

1776
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:52,440
Shhh, shh, shh!

1777
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:55,700
If you bark like that, you'll make the lady next door start
howling!

1778
01:42:56,400 --> 01:43:00,220
If you keep this up, that wall is going to come down on our
heads before we know it!

1779
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:04,080
But you'll protect me from anything if anything bad happens,
right, Missal?

1780
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:06,280
Of course I will!

1781
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:09,580
That's quite a big promise for a little fellow.

1782
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:12,940
The poor little guy's up against some formidable opponents.

1783
01:43:13,700 --> 01:43:15,580
The man in black and the woman in purple.

1784
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,740
What about the... Wait, the rat?

1785
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:22,020
Maybe she needs to see the rat and hide from it because
she's scared, right?

1786
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:24,580
We might have to redo.

1787
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:29,160
I might have to redo.

1788
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:30,840
Maybe she gets scared of the rat.

1789
01:43:31,460 --> 01:43:32,340
Time is passing.

1790
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:35,580
Why do you always give your mistress so much trouble?

1791
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:39,960
Guess I'm truly embarrassed by my own behavior.

1792
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,520
But when that little guy starts squeaking, it gets me all in
an uproar.

1793
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:50,080
And when I bark, Miss Camilla always comes over and gives me
a nice hug.

1794
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:54,420
Hmm, we might be able to take advantage of that for...

1795
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:56,440
Take advantage of that piece of information.

1796
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:57,140
Okay.

1797
01:43:58,880 --> 01:43:59,320
Huh?

1798
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:00,000
How?

1799
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:03,460
Wherever the donut falls, the rat shows up to check it out.

1800
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:07,040
And then you go and bark at the rat.

1801
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:10,460
And then our little lady comes to you and to quiet you down.

1802
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:12,820
That's just the way things work, I'm afraid.

1803
01:44:12,820 --> 01:44:18,580
So in other words, the donut can be the bait that will lead
the little lady to where we want her.

1804
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:21,040
Okay.

1805
01:44:25,330 --> 01:44:26,590
What's that up there?

1806
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:32,110
Oh my god.

1807
01:44:32,550 --> 01:44:32,850
Oh my god.

1808
01:44:33,930 --> 01:44:34,370
Sorry.

1809
01:44:36,150 --> 01:44:36,370
Shh.

1810
01:44:36,630 --> 01:44:36,910
Sorry.

1811
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:37,970
Oh my god.

1812
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:38,790
Missile.

1813
01:44:38,970 --> 01:44:39,070
Shh.

1814
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:42,390
You're stressing me out.

1815
01:44:45,310 --> 01:44:46,550
I think we're...

1816
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:47,510
Let's try moving again.

1817
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:49,930
Oh no, it goes back to the other spot.

1818
01:44:52,590 --> 01:44:53,430
Where'd the donuts go?

1819
01:44:56,230 --> 01:44:59,050
It's written into your jeans, the destiny to bark.

1820
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:03,170
Over here.

1821
01:45:06,750 --> 01:45:09,490
There's no way I can get over in these spots yet.

1822
01:45:10,710 --> 01:45:11,990
So let's drop another donut.

1823
01:45:15,550 --> 01:45:17,270
She's reaching for the donuts again.

1824
01:45:19,610 --> 01:45:20,270
So cute.

1825
01:45:22,770 --> 01:45:23,650
Okay, you rock.

1826
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:27,370
Oh, it didn't work this time.

1827
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:29,910
Damn, she is downing those donuts.

1828
01:45:31,010 --> 01:45:32,470
I can't make another donut fall.

1829
01:45:33,490 --> 01:45:34,210
What do we do now?

1830
01:45:34,290 --> 01:45:36,230
Without the donut, the squeaking guy won't come in.

1831
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:37,010
I won't bark.

1832
01:45:38,030 --> 01:45:38,890
Looks like the only...

1833
01:45:38,890 --> 01:45:40,810
Like, only one donut will fall.

1834
01:45:41,310 --> 01:45:44,130
But the donut's the only bait that will lead the little lady
to where we want her.

1835
01:45:44,610 --> 01:45:46,370
Maybe I should rethink my plan of attack.

1836
01:45:48,470 --> 01:45:48,870
Oh.

1837
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:57,390
I mean, this plays, and we can make her bark, right?

1838
01:45:58,630 --> 01:45:59,570
Oh my god.

1839
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:03,570
Might have to redo, yeah.

1840
01:46:03,850 --> 01:46:04,690
But, let's...

1841
01:46:04,690 --> 01:46:07,870
It's said that maybe we should sometimes wait until the end.

1842
01:46:08,730 --> 01:46:12,890
So let's not just stop right now, I think.

1843
01:46:16,050 --> 01:46:17,010
The spinning Santa.

1844
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:18,650
Can I reach it?

1845
01:46:18,770 --> 01:46:19,590
Oh, I can, I can!

1846
01:46:19,610 --> 01:46:20,130
Nice.

1847
01:46:22,010 --> 01:46:23,650
Oh, but I can't reach any of this.

1848
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:27,670
Oh, oh, rotate faster.

1849
01:46:28,330 --> 01:46:29,050
Wee!

1850
01:46:30,090 --> 01:46:30,810
Yeah!

1851
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:31,870
Oh, my God.

1852
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:37,410
Oh, I'm so close.

1853
01:46:41,630 --> 01:46:42,350
Nice.

1854
01:46:42,850 --> 01:46:43,550
Latch.

1855
01:46:43,770 --> 01:46:44,250
What's this?

1856
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:46,450
Oh.

1857
01:46:47,230 --> 01:46:48,510
Oh, time is passing.

1858
01:46:48,690 --> 01:46:49,350
Oh, gosh, I'm scared.

1859
01:46:51,130 --> 01:46:51,250
Oh.

1860
01:46:53,830 --> 01:46:55,110
Okay, there we go.

1861
01:46:55,950 --> 01:46:56,290
Okay.

1862
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:01,490
Okay, there we go.

1863
01:47:01,970 --> 01:47:02,390
What's this?

1864
01:47:03,110 --> 01:47:03,830
Rock the painting?

1865
01:47:05,270 --> 01:47:06,830
That didn't do anything?

1866
01:47:07,810 --> 01:47:08,110
Okay.

1867
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:10,670
Um.

1868
01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:15,030
Maybe let's rotate slower.

1869
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:18,370
The painting rocked.

1870
01:47:19,610 --> 01:47:20,250
Yes.

1871
01:47:20,650 --> 01:47:21,250
Okay, nice.

1872
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:22,170
we can get to the lamp.

1873
01:47:22,850 --> 01:47:23,650
We can get to the door.

1874
01:47:23,830 --> 01:47:25,890
This will open it and do that.

1875
01:47:27,210 --> 01:47:29,710
And then we have a little ball for the dog, right?

1876
01:47:31,230 --> 01:47:32,690
You sent that thing flying.

1877
01:47:33,490 --> 01:47:35,830
I like to tidy up by shoving eyesores under the sofa.

1878
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:39,370
How come you're looking at me when you say that?

1879
01:47:41,450 --> 01:47:42,130
Hey, wait a minute.

1880
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:43,130
Under the sofa, eh?

1881
01:47:43,270 --> 01:47:44,370
Yes, yes.

1882
01:47:44,850 --> 01:47:46,910
That might be a spot where the hitman wouldn't look.

1883
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:48,890
Come to think of it.

1884
01:47:51,850 --> 01:48:04,390
time why trying to catch me you're a naughty little doggy
aren't you you naughty little dog you which makes him a bad

1885
01:48:04,390 --> 01:48:14,350
hitman he's not mere sighted he is one step ahead okay he
doesn't know so my new plan is to hide the little lady under

1886
01:48:14,350 --> 01:48:23,470
the sofa the only problem is how do I lead her under there
yes Very good question indeed.

1887
01:48:24,370 --> 01:48:26,810
We don't have much time left.

1888
01:48:29,190 --> 01:48:30,390
Shoo, okay.

1889
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:36,790
And then we knock this music box down, but I don't think
it's doing much.

1890
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:39,550
Oh, I think we have to act it.

1891
01:48:39,570 --> 01:48:45,410
Maybe the dog is asleep, so if we play the ornament, the dog
might notice the ball underneath, right?

1892
01:48:47,750 --> 01:48:50,790
Shut that mud up, shut that mud up.

1893
01:48:52,070 --> 01:48:53,210
Does he notice it?

1894
01:48:53,670 --> 01:48:54,510
No, he didn't.

1895
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:55,450
He fell back asleep.

1896
01:48:56,650 --> 01:48:58,450
Oh my god, no way.

1897
01:48:59,030 --> 01:48:59,090
Three!

1898
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:00,130
What do you mean three?

1899
01:49:00,650 --> 01:49:02,490
Looks like I'm down to a few more seconds.

1900
01:49:03,070 --> 01:49:03,850
Miss Camilla!

1901
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:05,450
We have to do something!

1902
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:08,430
We just have to!

1903
01:49:09,910 --> 01:49:11,750
Now now, getting worked up isn't going to help.

1904
01:49:12,070 --> 01:49:13,090
We're down to the wire here.

1905
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:15,730
Do we have enough time to do something to change her fate?

1906
01:49:16,150 --> 01:49:18,230
Or is it time to use another one of my ghost tricks?

1907
01:49:18,850 --> 01:49:19,770
Another ghost trick.

1908
01:49:20,190 --> 01:49:20,730
What is it?

1909
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:24,690
We could rewind time and start all over again from four
minutes ago.

1910
01:49:25,310 --> 01:49:26,910
Whatever we do, we better hurry!

1911
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:29,430
Oh, geez.

1912
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:42,340
Um, how I can't I possess the ball?

1913
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:45,540
I don't think there's anything else I can do.

1914
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:53,000
Like, I can move the cart.

1915
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:54,800
Would that do anything?

1916
01:49:54,940 --> 01:49:56,180
Okay, worth a shot, right?

1917
01:49:56,940 --> 01:49:57,860
Move the cart.

1918
01:49:58,040 --> 01:49:58,440
Meow.

1919
01:50:01,910 --> 01:50:03,170
Oh, my God, too!

1920
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:03,890
Oh!

1921
01:50:05,530 --> 01:50:21,910
it didn't change anything um it's fan tover it's mint over
oh make the donut fall if we can't there's only one wait

1922
01:50:21,910 --> 01:50:32,310

1923
01:50:32,310 --> 01:50:33,910
she dies i can rewind still right

1924
01:50:37,490 --> 01:50:38,630
Yeah, you can silver star?

1925
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:39,450
Okay, okay.

1926
01:50:40,590 --> 01:50:42,390
The game deletes your save.

1927
01:50:45,570 --> 01:50:45,770
Okay.

1928
01:50:51,150 --> 01:50:51,670
Rocket!

1929
01:50:53,030 --> 01:50:53,490
Rocket!

1930
01:50:54,730 --> 01:50:55,630
Oh my god.

1931
01:50:57,710 --> 01:50:59,870
I don't think there's anything I can do.

1932
01:51:01,010 --> 01:51:01,830
I'm gonna open the door!

1933
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:04,230
Make that rat go flying!

1934
01:51:04,670 --> 01:51:05,870
I think we're done, Zo.

1935
01:51:08,850 --> 01:51:09,390
Danzo.

1936
01:51:11,550 --> 01:51:11,990
Uh.

1937
01:51:13,870 --> 01:51:14,730
Oh my god.

1938
01:51:15,010 --> 01:51:16,770
Why don't you lock your door?

1939
01:51:17,030 --> 01:51:17,570
Bite him!

1940
01:51:18,890 --> 01:51:19,550
Oh my god.

1941
01:51:20,910 --> 01:51:21,910
Listen up, little girl.

1942
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:23,190
I'll make you a deal.

1943
01:51:23,790 --> 01:51:25,830
If you promise to keep quiet, I'll let you live.

1944
01:51:26,370 --> 01:51:27,390
For now, anyway.

1945
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:32,520
What a shame.

1946
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:35,760
But I guess this brave little fellow refuses to accept...

1947
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:36,760
He's a dog!

1948
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:39,300
Missile!

1949
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:39,900
No!

1950
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:44,060
Okay.

1951
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:45,240
Oh!

1952
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:47,720
Time's up.

1953
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:50,360
Doesn't seem like I can stop the intruder from coming in.

1954
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:52,700
Guess this little doggy doesn't have much fighting power.

1955
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:55,900
People often tell me my name doesn't suit me.

1956
01:51:57,080 --> 01:52:01,100
I guess the only thing to do is hide our little lady
someplace where the hitman can't see her.

1957
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:04,720
Okay, let's rewind time.

1958
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:07,440
After fate change.

1959
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:09,180
Wait.

1960
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:11,260
Fate change what?

1961
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:11,680
Yeah, yeah.

1962
01:52:11,740 --> 01:52:12,900
We'll start from the fate change.

1963
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:14,900
didn't have anything to do with the donuts.

1964
01:52:16,940 --> 01:52:22,020
Then we don't have to wait for the headphones again.

1965
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:24,440
Okay.

1966
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:28,340
We probably shouldn't let that guy go flying.

1967
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:34,260
We probably shouldn't let that little guy go flying.

1968
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:37,560
But I think we should move the cart over here.

1969
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:47,080
And I also Don't want to exactly wait.

1970
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:50,160
Or I want to have the ball under there as well, I think.

1971
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:53,680
I think it would help to have the ball under there too.

1972
01:52:56,340 --> 01:52:56,780
Oh, wait.

1973
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:58,500
There we go.

1974
01:52:58,740 --> 01:52:59,000
Okay.

1975
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:02,360
I still am curious about this music box, though.

1976
01:53:04,860 --> 01:53:05,800
Rotate faster.

1977
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:11,440
Okay.

1978
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:15,700
Okay, let's open that.

1979
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:16,740
Oh, my God.

1980
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:19,260
Thank you for the 50 gifted wandering taco.

1981
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:19,860
Thank you.

1982
01:53:21,340 --> 01:53:21,980
Oh, oh, wait.

1983
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:22,720
Oh, no, I was right.

1984
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:24,040
Dang it.

1985
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:27,120
Oh, okay.

1986
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:28,120
Never mind.

1987
01:53:28,980 --> 01:53:29,400
Oh, my gosh.

1988
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:32,920
Okay, there we go.

1989
01:53:35,980 --> 01:53:36,420
Okay.

1990
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:41,680
I don't think there's anything we can do with the painting
that I know of.

1991
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:43,380
I also can't reach it.

1992
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:53,920
oh wait oh shoot i just realized we ah we have to do the
star first

1993
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:07,620
sometimes the going back and forth makes me like a little or
like the going ghost mode and not ghost mode makes me a

1994
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:12,020
little okay uh now the star

1995
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:28,080
yeah a little motion sick yeah oh there we go when it starts
going fast it can hurt the eyes yeah just a little what does

1996
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:33,540
it say here if you bark like that how could anybody enjoy
the pretty melody and your poor mistress has to get up and

1997
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:41,380
quiet you down every time yes i oh look at that one of the
ornaments fell off the tree not interested in things like

1998
01:54:41,380 --> 01:54:48,360
that i graduated from playing with balls a long time ago you
should try graduating from meatless barking too

1999
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:53,800
Sorry, that's one thing I could never give up.

2000
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:58,120
Okay, here.

2001
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:04,160
Here, here.

2002
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:11,160
I don't think it hurts to have this done, you know, to have
it there, I think.

2003
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:15,800
I don't think it hurts to have it under the couch.

2004
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:17,320
That's what I'm in.

2005
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:20,460
Okay, now, rock.

2006
01:55:23,060 --> 01:55:24,400
Wait, it goes that way?

2007
01:55:27,290 --> 01:55:29,010
Oh my gosh, it's a little pink mouse!

2008
01:55:31,510 --> 01:55:32,930
Uh, oh, oh, and then I...

2009
01:55:33,610 --> 01:55:35,130
Okay, hold on.

2010
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:37,100
Ugh!

2011
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:38,660
Do I fling her?

2012
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:39,580
Do I fling...

2013
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:40,600
Wait, which way does it open?

2014
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:46,310
I think I fling the mouse this way, right?

2015
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:51,020
Fuha!

2016
01:55:56,120 --> 01:55:56,500
Okay.

2017
01:55:58,320 --> 01:55:58,360
Okay.

2018
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:00,980
The yeet school.

2019
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:06,280
Oh, what are you doing under you, you silly boy?

2020
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:08,840
First dono currently going through exams.

2021
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:10,780
I love watching along while studying.

2022
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:12,040
Thanks for the fun streams.

2023
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:13,260
Thanks, Rainy, girl.

2024
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:14,160
Good luck with yours.

2025
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:15,240
Oh, exams.

2026
01:56:15,620 --> 01:56:16,880
I almost said your streams.

2027
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:19,580
Good luck with your exams.

2028
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:22,080
I'm taking another bite.

2029
01:56:36,150 --> 01:56:37,070
Oh, my little missile.

2030
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:38,670
You're always doing the cutest things.

2031
01:56:40,550 --> 01:56:41,110
Okay.

2032
01:56:42,030 --> 01:56:42,410
Oh!

2033
01:56:48,790 --> 01:56:50,110
Nobody's here, right?

2034
01:56:52,490 --> 01:56:53,510
Oh my god.

2035
01:56:55,450 --> 01:56:56,210
This guy is deaf.

2036
01:56:56,370 --> 01:57:01,290
He can't hear the dog going, My prey is bound to come home
sometime.

2037
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:04,110
Might as well make myself comfortable in the meantime.

2038
01:57:04,790 --> 01:57:06,350
Meanwhile, you better not eat a donut.

2039
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:10,230
Don't do it!

2040
01:57:13,150 --> 01:57:15,490
There, our little lady's fate has been averted.

2041
01:57:15,790 --> 01:57:16,170
Let's go!

2042
01:57:16,690 --> 01:57:17,670
We got it.

2043
01:57:18,430 --> 01:57:19,070
We got it.

2044
01:57:19,190 --> 01:57:19,870
We got it.

2045
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:21,510
It has?

2046
01:57:22,010 --> 01:57:25,050
A poor thing is still curled up in a ball and shaking with
fear.

2047
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:27,630
Well, yeah, that's true.

2048
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:29,490
But that's not so bad.

2049
01:57:29,770 --> 01:57:32,090
In the scheme of things, I'd say she's just fine.

2050
01:57:32,910 --> 01:57:34,430
And look, you're not dead.

2051
01:57:35,390 --> 01:57:35,910
Oh, you're right.

2052
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:37,050
We did it.

2053
01:57:37,410 --> 01:57:38,390
We did it, didn't we?

2054
01:57:39,790 --> 01:57:41,630
We did it, didn't we?

2055
01:57:42,890 --> 01:57:54,290
Well, to be precise, you're the one who did it huh me I
saved miss Camilla yep you're the one who led her under the

2056
01:57:54,290 --> 01:58:08,150
sofa right you protected your mistress I can attest to that
oh oh thank you fate averted can I ask a question sure what

2057
01:58:08,150 --> 01:58:16,850
is it what exactly are those strange powers of yours hit man
I'm going to take this donut and eat it.

2058
01:58:18,250 --> 01:58:19,190
Stop ancient meme.

2059
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:22,390
Oh, you mean my ghost tricks?

2060
01:58:23,010 --> 01:58:25,990
Apparently they're the power to manipulate inanimate
objects.

2061
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:28,950
So they're ghost tricks.

2062
01:58:30,090 --> 01:58:30,430
Oh, sorry.

2063
01:58:30,790 --> 01:58:33,730
If they're ghost tricks.

2064
01:58:36,810 --> 01:58:39,810
If they're ghost tricks, then can I do them too?

2065
01:58:40,210 --> 01:58:41,410
I'm dead too after all.

2066
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:42,910
I guess?

2067
01:58:43,370 --> 01:58:43,810
That's how it goes.

2068
01:58:43,910 --> 01:58:46,630
No, remember the The lamp said we're special.

2069
01:58:48,390 --> 01:58:51,550
I've been staring at those donuts as hard as I could for a
long time now.

2070
01:58:52,470 --> 01:58:53,610
But they won't budge for me.

2071
01:58:54,910 --> 01:58:56,170
Why do you suppose that is?

2072
01:58:56,950 --> 01:58:57,910
I don't really know.

2073
01:58:58,650 --> 01:59:00,410
I guess you just don't have that power.

2074
01:59:01,670 --> 01:59:03,510
Well, I have one thing to say to that.

2075
01:59:04,150 --> 01:59:05,430
That's not fair!

2076
01:59:06,690 --> 01:59:09,690
Sorry, but I guess not everyone who dies gets the power of
the dead.

2077
01:59:10,970 --> 01:59:12,430
So what's going to happen to me now?

2078
01:59:13,470 --> 01:59:14,170
Nothing, really.

2079
01:59:14,970 --> 01:59:16,110
Has been erased?

2080
01:59:18,050 --> 01:59:18,450
Oh my gosh.

2081
01:59:18,610 --> 01:59:21,330
Can you imagine if I like...

2082
01:59:21,330 --> 01:59:27,510
What if I got four minutes to go back and like not be dead?

2083
01:59:27,590 --> 01:59:28,770
What if I wasn't a ghost?

2084
01:59:29,210 --> 01:59:30,490
What if I wasn't a ghost made?

2085
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:37,640
What if I was just a normal maid?

2086
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:42,180
Wouldn't that be so weird?

2087
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:44,100
Do you guys prefer me dead or...

2088
01:59:49,740 --> 02:00:01,600
would you rather me be living and happy and like thriving in
life or would you rather me be a sad sad afterlife ghost the

2089
02:00:04,310 --> 02:00:05,690
dead thing kind of suits me

2090
02:00:15,370 --> 02:00:17,230
one ghost please

2091
02:00:20,590 --> 02:00:25,570
just don't be sad you're so right to take a walk tomorrow.

2092
02:00:28,050 --> 02:00:31,250
You'll just go back to being a happy little doggy, living
your everyday life.

2093
02:00:31,470 --> 02:00:34,690
See, he's going to go back to being a happy, alive dog.

2094
02:00:35,550 --> 02:00:37,150
Not a sad, dead dog.

2095
02:00:38,390 --> 02:00:39,530
This is a trick question.

2096
02:00:40,030 --> 02:00:41,710
A ghost trick question.

2097
02:00:45,070 --> 02:00:46,750
I guess this means goodbye.

2098
02:00:48,310 --> 02:00:50,410
But we'll meet again sometime, right?

2099
02:00:51,150 --> 02:00:51,990
Yeah, maybe.

2100
02:00:52,310 --> 02:00:56,850
If you die again, What you did for me tonight?

2101
02:00:57,630 --> 02:00:58,870
I'll never...

2102
02:00:58,870 --> 02:01:03,170
I'll never forget it!

2103
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:09,660
I guess we'd better get...

2104
02:01:09,660 --> 02:01:11,000
Get it...

2105
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:11,680
We...

2106
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:12,220
We...

2107
02:01:12,220 --> 02:01:13,620
We'd better...

2108
02:01:13,620 --> 02:01:15,980
We'd better get...

2109
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:17,120
Getting back...

2110
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:18,720
Wait, we'd better...

2111
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:24,900
I guess we'd better be getting back to the present.

2112
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:30,160
Time to see what happens.

2113
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:31,840
Next in our story.

2114
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:34,540
I'm okay.

2115
02:01:37,100 --> 02:01:38,960
I hope the dog doesn't bark.

2116
02:01:41,780 --> 02:01:44,020
Okay, and now a new present is born.

2117
02:01:45,620 --> 02:01:48,380
The little lady is still curled up in a ball and shaking
with fear.

2118
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,980
And the little doggy is wagging his tail happily.

2119
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:52,960
So what am I going to do now?

2120
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:56,360
I think I'll watch for a while and see what happens.

2121
02:01:56,740 --> 02:01:58,200
I didn't mess up with the ball, though.

2122
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:01,880
But we have the music box.

2123
02:02:02,340 --> 02:02:02,900
I have a question.

2124
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:08,260
Does this game only have one way to complete a thing?

2125
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:09,360
A puzzle?

2126
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:13,020
This is like asking your girlfriend...

2127
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:15,200
Wait, this is like your girlfriend asking you, do I look
fat?

2128
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:16,820
Still at the junkyard.

2129
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:18,100
Alright, got it.

2130
02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:19,740
I'm on my way.

2131
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:22,160
Oh, yes.

2132
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:22,600
Hmm.

2133
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:25,060
I guess my prey likes to play hide and seek.

2134
02:02:26,820 --> 02:02:28,480
that junkyard yet, apparently.

2135
02:02:29,020 --> 02:02:31,700
I can't let near-sighted G go beat me out of this one.

2136
02:02:32,160 --> 02:02:33,060
I'd better hurry.

2137
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:34,940
Oh, is he leaving?

2138
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:38,480
He's just leaving?

2139
02:02:39,880 --> 02:02:40,140
Okay.

2140
02:02:41,180 --> 02:02:41,580
Nice.

2141
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:44,860
Lock the door.

2142
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:47,100
Please, lock the door!

2143
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:51,100
What was that all about?

2144
02:02:52,740 --> 02:02:54,120
Opened the door with the rifle?

2145
02:02:54,260 --> 02:02:55,200
I know, he's so cool.

2146
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:56,720
You saved me, didn't you?

2147
02:02:56,740 --> 02:03:13,940
missile i just know you did oh my gosh maybe i shouldn't
answer it answers it anyway okay mochi mochi lynn trick time

2148
02:03:13,940 --> 02:03:22,000

2149
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:29,740
listen in oh no wait oh i didn't realize i There we go.

2150
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:32,940
And round we go.

2151
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:34,740
And over we...

2152
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:36,460
Oh.

2153
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:40,420
There's the little doggy all curled up on the floor.

2154
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,560
Dreaming away the life we worked so hard to get back for.

2155
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:47,220
That's fine.

2156
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:49,460
But what's up with that core?

2157
02:03:51,220 --> 02:03:52,100
Phone works again.

2158
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:52,800
Mysterious.

2159
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:55,660
Yeah, said like we couldn't use the phone in the four
minutes.

2160
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:58,720
The dead can't possess living creatures.

2161
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:01,900
That's one of the rules Mr. Desclamp taught me.

2162
02:04:02,140 --> 02:04:03,180
Say his name.

2163
02:04:04,100 --> 02:04:04,760
It's Ray!

2164
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:09,440
So what would a living and breathing doggy be doing with a
core?

2165
02:04:10,080 --> 02:04:11,400
I'd better try possessing him and see.

2166
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:13,860
I'm obsessed with possessing.

2167
02:04:15,580 --> 02:04:16,280
It's you!

2168
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:17,020
It's you!

2169
02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:19,380
It's, um, come to think of it.

2170
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:20,760
I never did ask your name.

2171
02:04:21,660 --> 02:04:23,520
I guess it's good we ran into each other again then.

2172
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:24,780
This music is so happy.

2173
02:04:25,940 --> 02:04:32,400
this is a good chance for us to reintroduce ourselves to
each other you mean you forgot my name already after

2174
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:42,280
everything we shared together the drama that tearful goodbye
I'm missile and I'm mental but you know it's strange I

2175
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:50,540
wonder why you remember me that now that you're alive again
do you remember your time being dead of course all of it

2176
02:04:50,540 --> 02:04:58,460
okay let me get this straight the memory of being dead And
the dead I meet in the ghost world develop a core when they

2177
02:04:58,460 --> 02:04:59,800
return to the land of the living.

2178
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:05,540
Then if I possess that core, I can talk to that person.

2179
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:09,320
Intra- I have to remember that I died?

2180
02:05:11,740 --> 02:05:12,220
Okay.

2181
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:14,960
It's a little traumatic, isn't it?

2182
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:17,160
Poor, poor Missile.

2183
02:05:17,740 --> 02:05:25,640
There's not a thought behind that eyes, but every day he
just sees himself staring down the barrel, directly at his

2184
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:26,120
face.

2185
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:29,040
He's just like, I'm traumatized.

2186
02:05:30,420 --> 02:05:32,020
It looks that way, yes.

2187
02:05:48,380 --> 02:05:49,500
Oh, thank goodness you're okay.

2188
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:53,240
Well, I don't know if I'm okay exactly.

2189
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,020
You won't believe what just...

2190
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:55,940
Listen to me.

2191
02:05:56,180 --> 02:05:57,700
You've got to get out of there right now.

2192
02:05:58,360 --> 02:05:59,140
What about dinner?

2193
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:00,860
I was thinking about spaghetti tonight.

2194
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:02,200
Yeah, spaghetti!

2195
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:05,600
I've been murdered before.

2196
02:06:05,940 --> 02:06:06,300
Really?

2197
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:08,960
Me too.

2198
02:06:09,740 --> 02:06:10,680
Nah, I'm just kidding.

2199
02:06:17,720 --> 02:06:17,900
Nah.

2200
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:20,880
I'm just...

2201
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:21,560
Nah.

2202
02:06:24,580 --> 02:06:25,060
Unless.

2203
02:06:26,060 --> 02:06:26,880
I'm eating more.

2204
02:06:37,670 --> 02:06:42,570
I won't be going back there for a while and you might be in
danger.

2205
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:56,720
You might be in danger if you stay there too.

2206
02:06:58,300 --> 02:07:08,000
but I already was in danger just a little while ago oh wow
Lynn could you like care at all meet me at that restaurant

2207
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:16,880

music box with you okay music box oh we got it I love music

2209
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:28,200
boxes.

2210
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:29,600
Is it a present for me?

2211
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:31,260
I'm sorry, but it doesn't play.

2212
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:32,680
I can't even get the lid open.

2213
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:36,300
Then you can't very well call it a music box.

2214
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:37,080
Then can you?

2215
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:38,560
More like just a box.

2216
02:07:38,900 --> 02:07:41,260
Oh, just a box.

2217
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:45,460
Just bring it, okay?

2218
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:47,540
It's kind of big and it's made out of wood.

2219
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:49,740
Okay, I will.

2220
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:50,560
Where is it?

2221
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:52,620
I kind of hid it in that room here.

2222
02:07:52,740 --> 02:07:53,900
And oh, well, we already got it.

2223
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:55,000
We sped run it.

2224
02:07:56,720 --> 02:07:57,480
What the hell are you?

2225
02:07:57,660 --> 02:07:58,160
Oh my god.

2226
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:01,200
Excuse me.

2227
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:01,800
Eek!

2228
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:02,680
Lynn!

2229
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:03,660
Oh no!

2230
02:08:05,180 --> 02:08:05,920
Oh my god.

2231
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:06,560
Cliffhanger.

2232
02:08:08,220 --> 02:08:08,720
Cliffhanger.

2233
02:08:10,460 --> 02:08:11,420
Not again.

2234
02:08:13,340 --> 02:08:13,820
Darn.

2235
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:14,220
Darn.

2236
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:14,300
Darn.

2237
02:08:14,300 --> 02:08:15,840
Now I've dropped the phone in there too.

2238
02:08:18,380 --> 02:08:19,280
What did it...

2239
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:20,320
Wouldn't it be corded?

2240
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:21,540
Like, you know, those kinds of old...

2241
02:08:21,540 --> 02:08:22,540
It looks really old.

2242
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:26,020
Poor fish.

2243
02:08:26,140 --> 02:08:26,480
Right?

2244
02:08:26,720 --> 02:08:28,780
The fish just got electrocuted!

2245
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:32,200
How about if we tell her you did it, Missile?

2246
02:08:33,380 --> 02:08:34,280
Woof, woof!

2247
02:08:34,940 --> 02:08:36,760
I sure hope Lynn's alright.

2248
02:08:38,180 --> 02:08:39,100
I'd better get going.

2249
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:41,640
I know right where Dead End Drive is.

2250
02:08:42,280 --> 02:08:44,280
But I never saw any music box around here.

2251
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:45,820
Where am I supposed to find it?

2252
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:48,040
Do you know where it is, Missile?

2253
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:50,780
Oh my gosh, Door of the Explorer time.

2254
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:54,860
Do you know where the music box is?

2255
02:08:57,580 --> 02:09:01,640
Here, if you know where the music box is.

2256
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:04,600
Where's the music box?

2257
02:09:16,630 --> 02:09:17,730
Over there.

2258
02:09:19,390 --> 02:09:20,990
Where is the music box?

2259
02:09:24,350 --> 02:09:27,770
Under the couch, are you stupid?

2260
02:09:30,030 --> 02:09:31,490
That's a ball.

2261
02:09:32,670 --> 02:09:34,810
Don't you know your basic shapes?

2262
02:09:38,260 --> 02:09:39,700
On the tree?

2263
02:09:42,100 --> 02:09:43,020
Good job!

2264
02:09:45,780 --> 02:09:46,940
Time to trip!

2265
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:49,500
Oh my gosh, look at she's searching, it's so cute.

2266
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:55,580
Oh no, she missed it!

2267
02:09:57,320 --> 02:09:58,440
Wait, how am I supposed to...

2268
02:09:58,440 --> 02:10:01,200
Oh, maybe I let this go off and then she'll see it.

2269
02:10:07,380 --> 02:10:08,860
She saw it!

2270
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:09,420
She saw it!

2271
02:10:10,220 --> 02:10:11,580
Dora for 30 year olds.

2272
02:10:14,620 --> 02:10:16,320
This is it, the music box.

2273
02:10:20,610 --> 02:10:22,230
It's about to say yippee.

2274
02:10:22,610 --> 02:10:23,410
I think, is she me?

2275
02:10:24,050 --> 02:10:25,310
I'll leave the remote here.

2276
02:10:25,630 --> 02:10:25,730
Good.

2277
02:10:26,490 --> 02:10:27,990
But don't you touch it, Missal.

2278
02:10:29,090 --> 02:10:30,990
If the TV comes on, you'll start barking.

2279
02:10:31,850 --> 02:10:34,630
I'd hate to find you flattened underneath that wall when I
came home.

2280
02:10:35,810 --> 02:10:37,610
She looks so genuinely sad about that.

2281
02:10:37,910 --> 02:10:40,070
All the stuff that's just in the fish tank.

2282
02:10:41,590 --> 02:10:43,070
Stay here and be a good boy.

2283
02:10:43,570 --> 02:10:44,730
I'm leaving now, Missal.

2284
02:10:45,750 --> 02:10:46,750
I have to go help Lynn.

2285
02:10:47,050 --> 02:10:48,330
She's like a sister to me, you know?

2286
02:10:48,870 --> 02:10:49,850
You'd be good, my boy.

2287
02:10:50,190 --> 02:10:51,330
And no barking.

2288
02:10:54,470 --> 02:10:56,710
How many tails does Missal have?

2289
02:10:58,350 --> 02:10:58,670
Um.

2290
02:11:01,690 --> 02:11:03,770
He's like actual tails.

2291
02:11:06,450 --> 02:11:08,290
Still no peace for the little lady.

2292
02:11:08,790 --> 02:11:11,470
And the redhead Lynn is facing a new crisis right now as
well.

2293
02:11:15,270 --> 02:11:17,290
Can your next dream be a key, Julie?

2294
02:11:17,310 --> 02:11:18,470
jingling stream

2295
02:11:24,930 --> 02:11:30,670
meanwhile I'm a bit of a in a pickle of my own with the
receiver at the bottom of this of the fish tank I find

2296
02:11:30,670 --> 02:11:37,530
myself still trapped in this apartment too bad I can't just
curl up and go to sleep with my tail wagging too because

2297
02:11:37,530 --> 02:11:41,650
there is something I must do question is how do I go about
getting out of here

2298
02:11:46,180 --> 02:11:59,480
do you guys do you guys need me to jingle keys for to uh pay
attention yay 7 31 to 804 new song welcome to the salon nice

2299
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:01,540
yes please

2300
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:15,600
the patchy saw is probably the most key jingling jingle core
stream you've done so far it was like my second stream

2301
02:12:18,020 --> 02:12:19,120
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

2302
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:23,340
Oh, what was I saying?

2303
02:12:24,080 --> 02:12:26,120
Oh no, maybe I need the keys more than you got.

2304
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:26,960
I need them too.

2305
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:32,000
Oh no, we're stuck in a loop of people who don't pay
attention and don't know what's going on.

2306
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:37,600
Once again, Lynn is in danger.

2307
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:39,660
And I think she knows it too.

2308
02:12:40,100 --> 02:12:42,600
I sincerely doubt she'll be coming back to this apartment
tonight.

2309
02:12:45,600 --> 02:12:47,480
She and I are connected to each other somehow.

2310
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:49,620
She's my only lead and I can't lose her.

2311
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:51,160
I have to get to her.

2312
02:12:51,220 --> 02:12:52,000
And fast.

2313
02:12:54,860 --> 02:12:56,200
You jingle the keys for us.

2314
02:12:56,300 --> 02:12:57,800
We jingle the keys for you.

2315
02:12:58,100 --> 02:12:58,460
Nice!

2316
02:12:59,480 --> 02:13:00,260
I'm paying attention.

2317
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:01,360
I see all the keys in chat.

2318
02:13:01,540 --> 02:13:02,740
Okay, I'm paying attention.

2319
02:13:05,180 --> 02:13:06,520
Maybe I get the remote.

2320
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:09,580
Hey, doggy.

2321
02:13:12,860 --> 02:13:15,160
Oof, oof, oof, oof!

2322
02:13:16,040 --> 02:13:20,420
If she does knock the wall down, then we'll be able to use
her phone.

2323
02:13:21,660 --> 02:13:21,840
See?

2324
02:13:23,260 --> 02:13:25,260
Oh my god, wait, she's actually going to knock it down.

2325
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:30,660
If you keep that racket up, I'll bring this whole
dilapidated building down on you.

2326
02:13:32,980 --> 02:13:33,980
Dingling, ling, ling, ling.

2327
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:37,440
Keep barking, missile!

2328
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:41,540
Did you hear what I just heard?

2329
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:44,060
You mean the lady next door is angry?

2330
02:13:46,240 --> 02:13:48,280
No, forget that.

2331
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:50,040
Tomoe!

2332
02:13:50,300 --> 02:13:50,860
Welcome to membership.

2333
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:51,400
Thank you.

2334
02:13:51,860 --> 02:13:55,180
It was the sound of a telephone ringing coming from the
apartment next door.

2335
02:13:56,100 --> 02:13:56,960
Oh, I get it.

2336
02:13:57,180 --> 02:13:59,820
You're thinking about borrowing her telephone, aren't you?

2337
02:14:01,260 --> 02:14:03,940
Saying it with that voice is a little funny.

2338
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:09,440
But how are you going to do that without breaking the wall
down?

2339
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:14,020
Well, the lady next door is kindly offering to do it for us.

2340
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:15,560
So...

2341
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:19,040
Yes, but she's mostly hoping to crush me underneath it.

2342
02:14:21,240 --> 02:14:23,500
Um, just keep, keep, keep doing it.

2343
02:14:26,160 --> 02:14:28,940
Oh, oh no, I didn't mean to make it go faster.

2344
02:14:30,620 --> 02:14:33,140
Uh, slow down a little.

2345
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:34,660
Slow, just calm down.

2346
02:14:35,080 --> 02:14:36,500
Wyvern Dragon.

2347
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:37,880
Wyvern Drag.

2348
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:40,180
Welcome to Memorandum Fellowship.

2349
02:14:40,340 --> 02:14:40,960
Thank you.

2350
02:14:41,020 --> 02:14:42,680
Oh, we're so close.

2351
02:14:42,940 --> 02:14:43,520
Can I rock?

2352
02:14:44,700 --> 02:14:45,580
Oh, it doesn't rock.

2353
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:46,160
rock enough.

2354
02:14:46,860 --> 02:14:52,280
I was thinking like it'll rock side to side and I could like
rock it over here.

2355
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:57,080
There's also up here but I don't think there's anything I
can get in there.

2356
02:14:57,960 --> 02:14:58,360
Hmm.

2357
02:14:59,380 --> 02:14:59,920
I'd rather not.

2358
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:00,840
Thanks for the vibe gifted.

2359
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:01,620
Thank you.

2360
02:15:03,400 --> 02:15:05,300
Um ma ma ma ma.

2361
02:15:10,380 --> 02:15:11,200

2362
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:12,500
Come on now.

2363
02:15:12,700 --> 02:15:14,060
Can't you bark any louder than that?

2364
02:15:14,700 --> 02:15:15,040
Louder!

2365
02:15:15,980 --> 02:15:25,240
But then that lady will knock the wall down on of me we'll
worry about that when it happens oh gosh anyway like i i

something else around here that gets a reaction out of him
uh the star

2369
02:15:49,060 --> 02:15:52,680
So we do the star and the show.

2370
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:55,600
Oh, there we go.

2371
02:16:00,020 --> 02:16:01,340
Oh my god.

2372
02:16:01,820 --> 02:16:02,660
I'll pound this.

2373
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:03,380
Oh my god.

2374
02:16:04,120 --> 02:16:04,620
Holy cow.

2375
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:08,240
Whoa!

2376
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:14,440
Did she just knock the dog unconscious?

2377
02:16:18,660 --> 02:16:20,120
I told you, didn't I?

2378
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:22,740
I told you I would knock the wall down on you.

2379
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:23,760
Oh!

2380
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:27,420
He's okay, right?

2381
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:30,640
He's okay, right, dog?

2382
02:16:32,140 --> 02:16:36,940
Oh, so this is what it feels like to have a wall knocked
down on you, huh?

2383
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:42,440
It's more like she knocked you out through the wall, really.

2384
02:16:42,900 --> 02:16:43,740
Oh my gosh, Tomoy!

2385
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:46,020
Thank you for the besting gift, and thank you!

2386
02:16:46,980 --> 02:16:48,460
I'm still alive, aren't I?

2387
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:50,980
Yes?

2388
02:16:51,480 --> 02:16:52,300
You are.

2389
02:16:52,960 --> 02:16:55,020
But the TV and the Star Ornament aren't.

2390
02:16:56,900 --> 02:17:05,500
I'll never bark again not as long as I live but wait a
minute it looks like here one second I'm gonna actually make

2391
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:12,660
this a bit smaller just so it's not so in the way sorry guys

Thank you so much.

2396
02:17:32,040 --> 02:17:34,300
It looks like all that commotion wasn't for not.

2397
02:17:35,420 --> 02:17:35,460
Huh?

2398
02:17:39,740 --> 02:17:43,160
Ooh, your barking made her create a path for me!

2399
02:17:43,880 --> 02:17:44,380
It did?

2400
02:17:44,840 --> 02:17:46,840
But the wall is still standing just like before!

2401
02:17:47,740 --> 02:17:49,860
But there are paths only the dead can see.

2402
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:52,020
Oh, those kinds of paths!

2403
02:18:00,060 --> 02:18:01,980
There we go.

2404
02:18:02,660 --> 02:18:02,800
Nice.

2405
02:18:03,520 --> 02:18:04,420
Easy peasy.

2406
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:06,020
Bye, Missile!

2407
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:08,760
Oh, so you're leaving, huh?

2408
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:11,860
I guess so.

2409
02:18:13,480 --> 02:18:15,960
You're going to go save Miss Camilla and Miss Lynn?

2410
02:18:17,520 --> 02:18:20,420
I have to follow my own mystery first and foremost.

2411
02:18:20,900 --> 02:18:22,140
That means everything to me.

2412
02:18:23,540 --> 02:18:25,380
But you will save them, right?

2413
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:28,900
If it helps me along the way, then yes.

2414
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:31,460
I don't have any powers of the dead.

2415
02:18:32,780 --> 02:18:33,980
I'm not even dead, actually.

2416
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:38,000
But I'm going to find a way to go help Miss Camilla too.

2417
02:18:39,140 --> 02:18:41,360
We create our own paths, right, Missa?

2418
02:18:42,140 --> 02:18:43,060
That's right.

2419
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:45,920
Okay, I'm leaving now.

2420
02:18:46,340 --> 02:18:47,720
Guess this is our second goodbye.

2421
02:18:48,900 --> 02:18:49,900
It is, isn't it?

2422
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:51,580
My name is Cicel.

2423
02:18:52,280 --> 02:18:54,640
If we ever meet again, that's what you can call me.

2424
02:18:55,500 --> 02:18:56,420
Cicel, huh?

2425
02:18:57,100 --> 02:18:57,600
Got it.

2426
02:18:57,840 --> 02:18:58,700
You know what, Cicel?

2427
02:18:59,620 --> 02:19:01,080
I'm going to create my own path.

2428
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:02,860
Just like you said.

2429
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:05,720
It goes to sleep.

2430
02:19:07,100 --> 02:19:07,160
Oh!

2431
02:19:08,500 --> 02:19:09,080
Missile?

2432
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:11,900
Missile!

2433
02:19:13,360 --> 02:19:14,520
Missile, please!

2434
02:19:19,150 --> 02:19:20,710
You're gonna get a conco...

2435
02:19:20,710 --> 02:19:21,870
Can dogs get concussions?

2436
02:19:23,690 --> 02:19:26,390
Tonight is that holiest of all nights.

2437
02:19:28,550 --> 02:19:37,650
All I need to get some inspiration from the muses is this
bottle and some cheese Here it's to the boorish people next

2438
02:19:37,650 --> 02:19:38,570
door.

2439
02:19:38,610 --> 02:19:43,290
Oh Nice we're inside this lady's house.

2440
02:19:43,510 --> 02:19:46,470
Oh my god, there's a mouse Who's sneezing?

2441
02:19:47,830 --> 02:19:49,570
Her hair is it like a tulip?

2442
02:19:51,710 --> 02:19:52,770
This is sexy music.

2443
02:19:53,430 --> 02:19:55,170
Are you all right my darling angel?

2444
02:19:55,170 --> 02:19:59,030
Have you taken your medicine like a good girl?

2445
02:19:59,370 --> 02:19:59,610
Oh,

2446
02:20:03,300 --> 02:20:04,800
she's got that gamer posture.

2447
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:05,880
She's perfect.

2448
02:20:08,100 --> 02:20:10,560
Here I am in yet another strange room.

2449
02:20:12,320 --> 02:20:15,220
What's with the oddly tense air of this place anyway?

2450
02:20:16,740 --> 02:20:18,940
Now, where is that little treasure I'm looking for?

2451
02:20:21,500 --> 02:20:22,720
Who's in the bed?

2452
02:20:24,260 --> 02:20:25,160
There it is.

2453
02:20:25,420 --> 02:20:25,980
The telephone.

2454
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:28,220
I can just borrow it.

2455
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:30,880
Who's in the bed, though?

2456
02:20:32,320 --> 02:20:33,540
I'm so curious.

2457
02:20:36,020 --> 02:20:36,580
Let's see.

2458
02:20:36,740 --> 02:20:38,060
We got this.

2459
02:20:38,560 --> 02:20:39,940
Oh, I can't reach that, can I?

2460
02:20:40,020 --> 02:20:40,420
Oh, we can.

2461
02:20:41,420 --> 02:20:42,720
I'm just gonna...

2462
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:46,700
We're just gonna let that go through.

2463
02:20:47,720 --> 02:20:49,680
And we're just gonna poke you a little bit.

2464
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:53,040
And we're just gonna scooch you a little bit.

2465
02:20:54,980 --> 02:20:56,620
I don't know why I'm doing all of this.

2466
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:00,000
oh

2467
02:21:03,670 --> 02:21:16,430
my god look at her go wait what is she saying oh mr prime
minister you mustn't i'm a married woman and i'm a married

2468
02:21:16,430 --> 02:21:27,430
man but we cannot resist this any longer i'm ready to
abdicate up abdicate it all for you she's writing fan

2469
02:21:27,430 --> 02:21:31,690
fiction even if it means my mean, ruination.

2470
02:21:33,670 --> 02:21:33,950
Hmm.

2471
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:35,350
Ruination.

2472
02:21:36,030 --> 02:21:37,070
Is that even a word?

2473
02:21:38,190 --> 02:21:41,070
And that abdicate just doesn't look right somehow.

2474
02:21:42,430 --> 02:21:44,970
This is going to nag me all night, I'm sure.

2475
02:21:46,450 --> 02:21:47,090
Oh my god.

2476
02:21:47,810 --> 02:21:48,370
Philosophie!

2477
02:21:48,490 --> 02:21:49,470
Thanks for the five gifted.

2478
02:21:50,690 --> 02:21:52,230
Um, boom, boom.

2479
02:21:53,210 --> 02:21:53,730
Examine?

2480
02:21:54,930 --> 02:21:56,170
Where is that dictionary?

2481
02:21:57,030 --> 02:21:58,050
This thing is too heavy.

2482
02:21:58,170 --> 02:21:59,130
I can't manipulate it.

2483
02:21:59,510 --> 02:22:00,290
Maybe that woman did.

2484
02:22:00,310 --> 02:22:03,190
built up her destructive power by hefting this puppy.

2485
02:22:04,630 --> 02:22:06,210
It's more like a weapon than a book.

2486
02:22:08,990 --> 02:22:09,450
Let's see.

2487
02:22:09,690 --> 02:22:11,090
I know I put it here somewhere.

2488
02:22:11,750 --> 02:22:13,750
Now where could it have gone to?

2489
02:22:15,210 --> 02:22:15,730
I'll...

2490
02:22:15,730 --> 02:22:16,010
Trick!

2491
02:22:17,490 --> 02:22:18,530
I still...

2492
02:22:18,530 --> 02:22:19,830
It's too heavy.

2493
02:22:22,030 --> 02:22:22,550
Uh...

2494
02:22:22,550 --> 02:22:24,310
I just can't find it.

2495
02:22:24,530 --> 02:22:25,710
Wait, the mouse is back!

2496
02:22:26,450 --> 02:22:28,370
Um, how do I time this?

2497
02:22:28,510 --> 02:22:28,950
Hmm.

2498
02:22:32,820 --> 02:22:35,040
Oh, no, I mustn't.

2499
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:39,740
I mustn't allow myself to believe in your love, Mr. Prime
Minister.

2500
02:22:41,720 --> 02:22:42,380
But why...

2501
02:22:42,380 --> 02:22:43,480
Wait, is that...

2502
02:22:43,480 --> 02:22:44,400
Is this him speaking?

2503
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:46,720
But why won't you believe in me?

2504
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:48,880
My love for you is true.

2505
02:22:49,440 --> 02:22:50,180
I swear.

2506
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:52,280
And it's so strong.

2507
02:22:52,740 --> 02:22:54,160
It overwhelms me.

2508
02:22:54,460 --> 02:22:54,920
Rah!

2509
02:22:55,500 --> 02:22:57,480
You know, I've always wondered.

2510
02:22:58,780 --> 02:23:02,760
If you can be overwhelmed by something, can you be just
plain...

2511
02:23:04,280 --> 02:23:06,060
This is going to...

2512
02:23:06,060 --> 02:23:07,300
Okay, hold on.

2513
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:10,580
Okay, we gotta get the mouse down there, alright?

2514
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:12,560
Oh wait, I can't reach it!

2515
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:13,200
Oh no!

2516
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:14,760
Wait, oh, here, from here.

2517
02:23:15,940 --> 02:23:16,220
Boink!

2518
02:23:17,820 --> 02:23:19,880
Is she gonna notice the mouse here?

2519
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:22,040
Oh!

2520
02:23:24,820 --> 02:23:25,540
Oh my god.

2521
02:23:30,620 --> 02:23:31,500
Oh, I missed it!

2522
02:23:31,580 --> 02:23:33,160
Okay, wait, I have to get him down there.

2523
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:34,120
I get it now, I get it.

2524
02:23:35,060 --> 02:23:35,820
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2525
02:23:35,900 --> 02:23:36,320
I get it now.

2526
02:23:36,420 --> 02:23:36,880
I get it.

2527
02:23:37,880 --> 02:23:38,920
Let's wait here.

2528
02:23:39,860 --> 02:23:41,180
Because he lands by the book.

2529
02:23:42,580 --> 02:23:42,920
Mint.

2530
02:23:43,240 --> 02:23:44,020
I'm sorry!

2531
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:44,900
I'm sorry.

2532
02:23:45,780 --> 02:23:45,960
Okay.

2533
02:23:46,960 --> 02:23:48,360
But I kind of also want to hear this.

2534
02:23:50,340 --> 02:23:50,340
No.

2535
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:53,200
Mr. Prime Minister, we mustn't.

2536
02:23:53,440 --> 02:23:55,200
If the people ever found out.

2537
02:23:56,240 --> 02:23:58,400
I don't care what they might think.

2538
02:23:59,800 --> 02:24:02,940
What do the plebeian masses understand anyway?

2539
02:24:03,400 --> 02:24:05,040
Certainly not, I love.

2540
02:24:06,140 --> 02:24:06,780
Hmm.

2541
02:24:07,620 --> 02:24:09,680
What is the Prime Minister talking about?

2542
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:10,980
I don't know.

2543
02:24:11,080 --> 02:24:11,920
It's your book!

2544
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:16,140
I've never even heard the word plebeian before.

2545
02:24:18,340 --> 02:24:19,300
What is it?

2546
02:24:19,300 --> 02:24:20,720
AI writing it for you?

2547
02:24:23,640 --> 02:24:25,720
And you're just, like, taking it?

2548
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:27,920
She doesn't even know!

2549
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:29,400
Okay.

2550
02:24:31,860 --> 02:24:32,480
Oh, wait.

2551
02:24:32,540 --> 02:24:32,920
Tilt.

2552
02:24:34,020 --> 02:24:34,340
Beep.

2553
02:24:36,440 --> 02:24:40,260
Uh, boop, boop, spin, pew!

2554
02:24:42,300 --> 02:24:44,160
And now she'll find it.

2555
02:24:44,360 --> 02:24:44,860
No, what?

2556
02:24:49,390 --> 02:24:50,690
She didn't find it.

2557
02:24:57,230 --> 02:24:59,690
I like watching her typos, like really.

2558
02:25:00,310 --> 02:25:01,550
Oh no, we've read it, okay.

2559
02:25:02,750 --> 02:25:03,810
Uh, did I do it too soon?

2560
02:25:03,990 --> 02:25:05,850
Okay, I have to go through it again though.

2561
02:25:06,670 --> 02:25:08,370
Okay, all right.

2562
02:25:11,110 --> 02:25:11,470
Psew!

2563
02:25:12,690 --> 02:25:13,810
Maybe she- Okay, wait a second.

2564
02:25:13,910 --> 02:25:16,590
Maybe she has to see the rat, and then I knock it onto the
floor.

2565
02:25:17,150 --> 02:25:17,430
Right?

2566
02:25:19,850 --> 02:25:21,650
Maybe she sees the rat first.

2567
02:25:28,500 --> 02:25:29,560
There we go.

2568
02:25:32,680 --> 02:25:33,340
Oh, there it is.

2569
02:25:34,020 --> 02:25:35,560
Let's not care about the rat anymore.

2570
02:25:37,700 --> 02:25:38,100
Yippee!

2571
02:25:40,360 --> 02:25:41,700
But it's strange.

2572
02:25:42,160 --> 02:25:44,380
I know I left this dictionary on the shelf.

2573
02:25:45,160 --> 02:25:47,880
It's as if some little angel were playing nightly.

2574
02:25:47,900 --> 02:26:00,040
naughty tricks on me I cannot get her accent oh she's like
sometimes southern sometimes British perhaps my darling

2575
02:26:00,040 --> 02:26:06,560

2576
02:26:10,980 --> 02:26:16,120
British good choo mama turn

2578
02:26:25,620 --> 02:26:41,280
where else do I go for oh my god she's so cute oh she's so
cute she looks like uh the other girl from re-zero it is

2579
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:46,900
common for writers to lose their plot to the characters they
just steal the plot we had planned and change it we are

2580
02:26:46,900 --> 02:26:53,240
weird like that no snake we mustn't if otakon ever finds out
said Ocelot?

2581
02:26:53,580 --> 02:26:54,040
I don't care.

2582
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:55,080
What does that Otaku?

2583
02:26:55,420 --> 02:26:55,760
No!

2584
02:26:56,840 --> 02:26:57,760
Wrong snake!

2585
02:26:57,960 --> 02:26:58,640
Oh yeah, Beatrice!

2586
02:26:58,960 --> 02:26:59,640
Beatrice, Beatrice.

2587
02:27:01,540 --> 02:27:03,280
What is it, my darling angel?

2588
02:27:04,220 --> 02:27:06,220
Ow, my head hurts, mama.

2589
02:27:07,420 --> 02:27:10,700
You poor dear, and no wonder with a fever of 102.

2590
02:27:11,620 --> 02:27:14,160
Here's to a night of wait, a night of fever.

2591
02:27:14,540 --> 02:27:16,660
Hotter than the love of my prime minister.

2592
02:27:17,480 --> 02:27:17,640
Oh!

2593
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:22,420
It's almost time for me to... Wait, time to go out.

2594
02:27:22,580 --> 02:27:25,040
For my lesson, can I take the night off?

2595
02:27:26,120 --> 02:27:28,120
Yes, I suppose that would be best.

2596
02:27:28,620 --> 02:27:29,260
But wait a minute.

2597
02:27:30,180 --> 02:27:33,500
I bet you're happy to have an excuse to get out of it,
aren't you?

2598
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:35,020
Not especially.

2599
02:27:35,780 --> 02:27:40,120
If I ever don't want to go, I just don't go and pretend I
did.

2600
02:27:42,580 --> 02:27:45,220
Don't reveal your secrets, Beatrice.

2601
02:27:46,960 --> 02:27:49,840
I go play with Camilla next door or something.

2602
02:27:52,580 --> 02:28:03,560
my darling angel oh hey today is papa's birthday oh is it

02:28:23,180 --> 02:28:25,520
I just have one thing to say.

2606
02:28:26,420 --> 02:28:28,640
Don't try and put me in the middle of you two.

2607
02:28:28,900 --> 02:28:29,320
Okay?

2608
02:28:31,820 --> 02:28:33,820
Whatever could you be talking about?

2609
02:28:35,260 --> 02:28:36,840
I know what's going on, you know.

2610
02:28:37,420 --> 02:28:40,220
You write novels and Papa wants you to stop.

2611
02:28:40,960 --> 02:28:44,380
But it was very selfish of you to take me and leave the
house.

2612
02:28:44,920 --> 02:28:46,100
What is going on?

2613
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:48,140
I want to go home.

2614
02:28:51,100 --> 02:28:51,680
Uh...

2615
02:28:55,090 --> 02:28:55,670
Uh...

2616
02:28:55,670 --> 02:28:55,850
Uh...

2617
02:28:55,850 --> 02:28:59,190
Now, now, it's time for good little girls to go to sleep.

2618
02:28:59,570 --> 02:29:01,890
Especially sick little girls.

2619
02:29:04,850 --> 02:29:05,430
Sleeps.

2620
02:29:05,430 --> 02:29:06,470
I hate you, mama!

2621
02:29:06,850 --> 02:29:07,430
Dang.

2622
02:29:07,810 --> 02:29:07,990
Oh!

2623
02:29:09,250 --> 02:29:11,190
What is going on?

2624
02:29:11,690 --> 02:29:13,290
Oh yeah, we haven't checked the...

2625
02:29:13,290 --> 02:29:13,750
What's it called?

2626
02:29:14,030 --> 02:29:14,350
Oh wait.

2627
02:29:14,770 --> 02:29:15,730
Uh, this one.

2628
02:29:16,510 --> 02:29:17,190
Z-L.

2629
02:29:18,230 --> 02:29:20,190
We haven't checked the...

2630
02:29:20,270 --> 02:29:21,710
This in a while.

2631
02:29:21,930 --> 02:29:23,550
She's still sitting there in the rain.

2632
02:29:25,790 --> 02:29:26,570
Hunter in the dog.

2633
02:29:26,810 --> 02:29:28,010
Eyebrowed villain.

2634
02:29:29,450 --> 02:29:31,190
Masked muscle man.

2635
02:29:32,250 --> 02:29:34,070
The other hitman.

2636
02:29:35,550 --> 02:29:36,790
The little lady.

2637
02:29:38,170 --> 02:29:39,330
I love it.

2638
02:29:39,990 --> 02:29:40,890
Valiant pet.

2639
02:29:43,990 --> 02:29:45,310
Perfumed lady.

2640
02:29:46,930 --> 02:29:52,150
Apparently she's a novelist who moved here agreement with
her husband.

2641
02:29:54,270 --> 02:29:55,190
Feverish firecracker.

2642
02:29:56,270 --> 02:29:57,610
Apparently she and Camilla are friends.

2643
02:29:57,790 --> 02:29:59,490
She isn't going out for her lesson tonight.

2644
02:30:00,230 --> 02:30:02,430
Aww, look at her, she's so sick, it's so sad.

2645
02:30:03,790 --> 02:30:04,830
And then the phone book.

2646
02:30:05,710 --> 02:30:07,150
Oh, it's these places, okay.

2647
02:30:07,850 --> 02:30:08,310
Cool.

2648
02:30:09,490 --> 02:30:11,810
Wait, a music box was hidden in the ceiling.

2649
02:30:12,590 --> 02:30:12,770
Mmm.

2650
02:30:15,370 --> 02:30:16,290
Big lady.

2651
02:30:18,610 --> 02:30:19,990
These two are quite a pair.

2652
02:30:20,270 --> 02:30:24,270
The father would have to be a pretty strong man to hold his
own against them.

2653
02:30:24,650 --> 02:30:26,910
Sounds like their family circumstances are pretty
complicated.

2654
02:30:27,730 --> 02:30:28,950
I wonder if I had a family.

2655
02:30:29,610 --> 02:30:32,990
How, when, when do we get to, oh, my lamp is out.

2656
02:30:36,230 --> 02:30:36,410
Wait.

2657
02:30:37,450 --> 02:30:39,030
Ma'am, what are you about to do with that?

2658
02:30:40,110 --> 02:30:40,650
Ma'am?

2659
02:30:42,770 --> 02:30:44,170
Ma'am, what are you about to?

2660
02:30:45,490 --> 02:30:47,110
What are you about to do with that?

2661
02:30:50,270 --> 02:31:00,110
it immediately but i just i was gonna look to see if there
was anything else around but um um wow

2662
02:31:03,450 --> 02:31:08,770
she's a keeper is this still too heavy she brought this
dictionary all the way over here don't look at something

2663
02:31:08,770 --> 02:31:13,350
look something up you did not just say irregardless

2664
02:31:24,220 --> 02:31:25,020
is this all

2665
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:33,520
I can't tell if this is on purpose or not.

2666
02:31:34,380 --> 02:31:35,720
Should have read the dictionary.

2667
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:37,760
This is probably on purpose, right?

2668
02:31:38,220 --> 02:31:39,400
Here it sits all alone.

2669
02:31:39,660 --> 02:31:44,860
Either she forgot what she wanted to look up, or she forgot
she even wanted to look anything up in the first place.

2670
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:45,980
Hmm.

2671
02:31:46,360 --> 02:31:47,880
Is irregardless really a word?

2672
02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:48,640
Okay.

2673
02:31:51,380 --> 02:31:52,740
My darling lady.

2674
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:54,340
Oh, my darling lady.

2675
02:31:54,680 --> 02:31:56,520
To think that you were a spy all along.

2676
02:31:57,840 --> 02:31:58,300
What?

2677
02:31:59,100 --> 02:31:59,300
What?

2678
02:31:59,320 --> 02:32:01,760
What are you going to do to me, Mr. Prime Minister?

2679
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:05,900
I will arrest you and make sure you receive the proper
penalty.

2680
02:32:06,800 --> 02:32:13,960
You're sentenced to be imprisoned in my cell of love and
punished with my whip of passion!

2681
02:32:15,480 --> 02:32:16,780
Ooh, la la!

2682
02:32:17,240 --> 02:32:19,380
Oh, Mr. Prime Minister!

2683
02:32:20,260 --> 02:32:21,760
Oh, my dear lady!

2684
02:32:22,280 --> 02:32:24,620
I would totally listen to an audiobook of this.

2685
02:32:26,700 --> 02:32:29,280
I'd hate to live in this Prime Minister's country.

2686
02:32:33,080 --> 02:32:33,660
when

2687
02:32:40,180 --> 02:32:47,660
that's still too far away for me to reach everything is
still too far I have to do something when we turn the knob

2688
02:32:47,660 --> 02:33:05,040
right it's right up your alley it actually is um hmm I
forgot about your harlequin knob hobby is that uh isn't a

2689
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:10,420
harlequin novel like um an actual brand only

2690
02:33:28,970 --> 02:33:45,350
thing i can think of doing is turning off the line what is
going on oh she made a typo ah okay got it got it okay we

2691
02:33:45,350 --> 02:33:47,330
have to wait for her to make a typo, clearly.

2692
02:33:48,970 --> 02:33:50,490
Oh, I just want to watch this again, though.

2693
02:33:53,530 --> 02:33:56,310
She has one spicy mama.

2694
02:33:58,030 --> 02:34:01,070
She has one hot meatball!

2695
02:34:02,290 --> 02:34:02,690
Yeah!

2696
02:34:06,950 --> 02:34:08,990
Uh, I guess I'll turn it off again.

2697
02:34:09,190 --> 02:34:09,590
Is that... Oh!

2698
02:34:09,990 --> 02:34:11,730
Okay, now she makes the typo.

2699
02:34:13,510 --> 02:34:14,130
There we go.

2700
02:34:15,270 --> 02:34:15,670
Uh-huh.

2701
02:34:16,650 --> 02:34:17,370
Pew!

2702
02:34:18,210 --> 02:34:18,590
Oh!

2703
02:34:21,780 --> 02:34:23,940
Oh, we're so close!

2704
02:34:24,960 --> 02:34:26,260
Okay, now we have to wait.

2705
02:34:26,420 --> 02:34:29,080
Wait, how do we get her to make another typo?

2706
02:34:32,040 --> 02:34:32,760
Um...

2707
02:34:32,760 --> 02:34:33,440
Wait.

2708
02:34:36,500 --> 02:34:37,220
Uh...

2709
02:34:39,300 --> 02:34:40,020
Um...

2710
02:34:42,630 --> 02:34:44,030
Oh!

2711
02:34:47,550 --> 02:34:48,250
Oh!

2712
02:34:48,570 --> 02:34:48,930
Pew!

2713
02:34:50,510 --> 02:34:51,630
There we go.

2714
02:34:53,130 --> 02:34:55,410
Oh, wait, I wanted to do the other one, though.

2715
02:34:56,730 --> 02:34:58,170
I wanted to do the clock, but that's okay.

2716
02:35:01,490 --> 02:35:02,950
Also, Yanwei, I see your don't know.

2717
02:35:03,630 --> 02:35:05,510
Love the flower hair lady's voice.

2718
02:35:07,630 --> 02:35:09,750
No, I use this as the prime minister.

2719
02:35:12,170 --> 02:35:14,750
If you're made mint, does that voice belong to mistress
mint?

2720
02:35:15,390 --> 02:35:16,490
Anyway, missile is best dog.

2721
02:35:16,610 --> 02:35:17,030
So true.

2722
02:35:18,810 --> 02:35:19,330
Who's saying this?

2723
02:35:19,390 --> 02:35:19,550
Hello?

2724
02:35:19,650 --> 02:35:20,090
Is that you?

2725
02:35:21,410 --> 02:35:21,770
Oh.

2726
02:35:22,830 --> 02:35:25,190
How many times are you going to make me tell you?

2727
02:35:25,850 --> 02:35:29,590
Tonight is that holiest of all nights, my deadline.

2728
02:35:31,030 --> 02:35:34,590
Please, I'm begging you, change your mind, and come home to
me.

2729
02:35:36,010 --> 02:35:38,890
I think you're the one who needs to change his mind.

2730
02:35:39,810 --> 02:35:41,670
Please, put yourself in my position.

2731
02:35:42,050 --> 02:35:44,430
You can write your novel just as well from home.

2732
02:35:45,650 --> 02:35:49,350
Until you change your mind, your daughter and I won't be
coming home.

2733
02:35:50,370 --> 02:35:52,470
Even if that means, forever!

2734
02:35:57,250 --> 02:36:06,170
let me talk to Amelie oh her name is Amelie that at least
you can't talk to her she's sick with the fever right now

2735
02:36:06,170 --> 02:36:14,930

Papa now I don't want to hear your voice anymore tonight

2736
02:36:14,930 --> 02:36:23,850

2737
02:36:25,830 --> 02:36:26,730
I love them.

2738
02:36:27,130 --> 02:36:28,090
They're so dramatic.

2739
02:36:30,510 --> 02:36:33,450
Wow, we get to go to Trouble...

2740
02:36:35,650 --> 02:36:36,890
Yay, Trouble...

2741
02:36:37,710 --> 02:36:39,050
Trouble Man's apartment.

2742
02:36:41,090 --> 02:36:41,410
Oh, whoops.

2743
02:36:41,630 --> 02:36:42,950
I didn't mean to press that.

2744
02:36:43,950 --> 02:36:45,410
You voice her so well, Mint.

2745
02:36:45,610 --> 02:36:46,450
Thank you.

2746
02:36:47,390 --> 02:36:50,850
Oh, we can't even reach her, though.

2747
02:36:51,850 --> 02:36:59,590
I'm curious about what up there though oh no okay we just

Are you alright, sir?

2753
02:37:32,920 --> 02:37:36,620
Oh, oh, I ordered all of you not to come near me.

2754
02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:37,800
Ow!

2755
02:37:41,850 --> 02:37:48,330
One of my favorite emotes is the dancing lady emo because
her legs are all like kicked up and she's all like, yippee!

2756
02:37:49,270 --> 02:37:52,010
And he looked just like the dancing lady emo.

2757
02:37:53,630 --> 02:37:55,330
Oh my gosh, it's so good.

2758
02:37:56,410 --> 02:37:57,770
I beg your pardon, sir.

2759

person.

2762
02:38:29,910 --> 02:38:32,430
I wish these telephone lines came with nameplates or
something.

2763
02:38:32,970 --> 02:38:33,330
Sheesh.

2764
02:38:35,370 --> 02:38:36,510
Alright, let's trick around.

2765
02:38:37,390 --> 02:38:38,230
Let's see what we got.

2766
02:38:39,830 --> 02:38:45,790
Documents, medicine, bottle, water pitcher, flap the flag.

2767
02:38:48,310 --> 02:38:48,470
Whoops.

2768
02:38:51,770 --> 02:38:52,410
Flap.

2769
02:38:54,230 --> 02:38:55,830
No, I still can't reach.

2770
02:38:57,230 --> 02:38:57,750
Huh.

2771
02:39:04,410 --> 02:39:05,470
Is there anything else in here?

2772
02:39:06,930 --> 02:39:07,570
Oh wow!

2773
02:39:08,090 --> 02:39:09,450
Whoa, this room is huge!

2774
02:39:11,410 --> 02:39:12,590
There's a big old melon!

2775
02:39:13,350 --> 02:39:15,290
Oh my god, it must remind him of her!

2776
02:39:16,350 --> 02:39:16,850
Aww.

2777
02:39:17,630 --> 02:39:19,150
And the door is open.

2778
02:39:19,410 --> 02:39:19,930
Uh oh.

2779
02:39:21,050 --> 02:39:21,710
Uh oh.

2780
02:39:22,330 --> 02:39:26,050
What is with these people not leaving their, not locking
their doors?

2781
02:39:30,050 --> 02:39:32,410
The contraption to do the fan.

2782
02:39:33,830 --> 02:39:34,890
Anything up in the ceiling?

2783
02:39:35,110 --> 02:39:35,310
No.

2784
02:39:37,270 --> 02:39:38,390
Don't say melon.

2785
02:39:39,090 --> 02:39:40,170
You need to leave!

2786
02:39:42,930 --> 02:39:44,430
Oh, my bad.

2787
02:39:45,630 --> 02:39:46,830
How am I supposed to...

2788
02:39:53,620 --> 02:39:55,340
I still can't reach!

2789
02:39:59,220 --> 02:39:59,620
Hmm.

2790
02:40:03,240 --> 02:40:03,880
Gonzalo!

2791
02:40:07,620 --> 02:40:09,900
That feels like as far as I can get.

2792
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:16,560
Probably involves the fan, which means there's another way
to get to it, but I've...

2793
02:40:16,560 --> 02:40:19,100
There's nothing else that I can...

2794
02:40:19,100 --> 02:40:19,600
Possess.

2795
02:40:24,530 --> 02:40:25,390
Thanks, Enve!

2796
02:40:27,050 --> 02:40:30,730
I mean, nothing that I can, like, possess and do something
with, you know.

2797
02:40:37,830 --> 02:40:38,270
Maybe...

2798
02:40:38,270 --> 02:40:40,110
Maybe I can't do anything yet.

2799
02:40:43,270 --> 02:40:44,390
Maybe I have to wait.

2800
02:40:48,450 --> 02:40:49,010
Wait, can I...

2801
02:40:49,010 --> 02:40:50,990
If I go back to this lady's apartment...

2802
02:40:52,770 --> 02:40:54,090
What if I go back to the junkyard?

2803
02:40:54,190 --> 02:40:54,710
Is she still there?

2804
02:40:54,810 --> 02:40:56,770
No, she said she was going to the restaurant, right?

2805
02:41:01,510 --> 02:41:02,770
Vizit Missal, I miss him.

2806
02:41:04,290 --> 02:41:05,310
Me, you, you, thank you!

2807
02:41:05,650 --> 02:41:06,330
I love you so much!

2808
02:41:06,470 --> 02:41:07,130
Thank you!

2809
02:41:08,650 --> 02:41:11,970
Not much time has passed since I was here last, but the
situation has changed.

2810
02:41:14,090 --> 02:41:14,690
Whoa!

2811
02:41:15,350 --> 02:41:15,690
Who are these?

2812
02:41:17,210 --> 02:41:19,670
Looks like they're examining my body.

2813
02:41:20,290 --> 02:41:21,090
I wonder who they are.

2814
02:41:21,250 --> 02:41:21,670
Oh my gosh.

2815
02:41:22,250 --> 02:41:23,750
Phoenix pre-spike.

2816
02:41:25,750 --> 02:41:27,250
And the other... Oh my god.

2817
02:41:28,170 --> 02:41:28,830
Dancing Pixar.

2818
02:41:29,570 --> 02:41:32,570
Besides them, a certain somebody else wriggles and bounces
happily.

2819
02:41:33,010 --> 02:41:34,710
I wonder who that person really is too.

2820
02:41:35,930 --> 02:41:36,590
It's Feeny.

2821
02:41:38,010 --> 02:41:38,970
Welcome back.

2822
02:41:39,250 --> 02:41:40,310
You weren't gone very long.

2823
02:41:41,190 --> 02:41:41,970
What's going on here?

2824
02:41:42,610 --> 02:41:45,030
The police are here to start the criminal investigation.

2825
02:41:45,390 --> 02:41:46,470
You know, into your murder.

2826
02:41:46,730 --> 02:41:49,090
The guy in the green suit looks like the other prosecutor.

2827
02:41:49,770 --> 02:41:53,950
Um, the really wimpy guy who always gets his hair blown off.

2828
02:41:55,330 --> 02:41:57,190
John attorney name Ace.

2829
02:41:57,970 --> 02:41:58,310
Yeah.

2830
02:42:01,970 --> 02:42:03,390
You know, into your murder?

2831
02:42:04,050 --> 02:42:05,170
My murder case, eh?

2832
02:42:05,830 --> 02:42:06,450
Where is Lynn?

2833
02:42:06,710 --> 02:42:07,210
Is she alright?

2834
02:42:07,830 --> 02:42:09,810
So you found out her name already, did you?

2835
02:42:10,170 --> 02:42:10,970
I'm impressed.

2836
02:42:17,450 --> 02:42:18,490
Excuse me!

2837
02:42:18,810 --> 02:42:22,030
Mad scientist.

2838
02:42:22,510 --> 02:42:26,210
It sounded like she was in some sort of, some kind of
immediate danger.

2839
02:42:27,810 --> 02:42:28,490
Where's Gumshoe?

2840
02:42:28,850 --> 02:42:30,550
So true, I missed that guy.

2841
02:42:31,370 --> 02:42:32,150
Mr. Payne!

2842
02:42:32,390 --> 02:42:35,370
Yes, that's the other attorney yet, or sorry, prosecutor.

2843
02:42:36,310 --> 02:42:36,950
Yes, yes.

2844
02:42:37,710 --> 02:42:40,330
Not to mention the fact a hitman is after her again.

2845
02:42:43,450 --> 02:42:44,850
I'm eating again.

2846
02:42:45,570 --> 02:42:47,770
I am once again taking a bite of chicken.

2847
02:42:50,130 --> 02:42:50,890
Oh, um...

2848
02:43:05,310 --> 02:43:05,490
Mmm.

2849
02:43:05,790 --> 02:43:07,230
You don't have to worry about that kind of thing.

2850
02:43:08,550 --> 02:43:08,830
What?

2851
02:43:09,910 --> 02:43:12,870
She was just taken into custody a few minutes ago?

2852
02:43:14,350 --> 02:43:14,730
Custody?

2853
02:43:15,230 --> 02:43:16,150
You mean she was arrested?

2854
02:43:16,570 --> 02:43:17,170
But why?

2855
02:43:21,040 --> 02:43:23,300
I feel bad because your chicken is probably cold by now.

2856
02:43:23,480 --> 02:43:24,280
It is, but that's okay.

2857
02:43:24,760 --> 02:43:25,460
I'll eat anything.

2858
02:43:26,280 --> 02:43:27,340
I'm a hungry ghost.

2859
02:43:29,400 --> 02:43:30,300
I don't know.

2860
02:43:30,480 --> 02:43:31,260
I'm just a desk lamp.

2861
02:43:31,360 --> 02:43:32,260
Shut up!

2862
02:43:32,360 --> 02:43:33,000
No, you're not!

2863
02:43:34,100 --> 02:43:35,860
I'd better see what I can find out.

2864
02:43:36,740 --> 02:43:37,440
Trick time.

2865
02:43:37,820 --> 02:43:38,780
Doesn't he look like pain?

2866
02:43:42,160 --> 02:43:42,720
Traffical.

2867
02:43:42,960 --> 02:43:43,260
Ultra.

2868
02:43:44,220 --> 02:43:45,300
My body.

2869
02:43:45,940 --> 02:43:46,300
Cicel.

2870
02:43:47,620 --> 02:43:48,020
Bag.

2871
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:53,900
What do you say in here?

2872
02:43:54,720 --> 02:43:55,780
Quite a thing, huh?

2873
02:43:56,040 --> 02:43:56,640
This case.

2874
02:43:58,020 --> 02:43:58,300
Yes!

2875
02:43:58,800 --> 02:43:59,660
One of our own.

2876
02:43:59,760 --> 02:44:00,400
A murderer.

2877
02:44:01,040 --> 02:44:02,580
Heads will rule over this.

2878
02:44:02,900 --> 02:44:03,820
One of our own.

2879
02:44:07,500 --> 02:44:10,000
Starting my first ever job next week.

2880
02:44:10,380 --> 02:44:10,700
So excited.

2881
02:44:10,920 --> 02:44:12,880
Your streams have kept me motivated these past few weeks.

2882
02:44:13,400 --> 02:44:14,500
So thank you so much.

2883
02:44:14,540 --> 02:44:15,780
Touch-talking!

2884
02:44:16,820 --> 02:44:17,380
Congratulations!

2885
02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:21,280
Congrats!

2886
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:23,940
I hope you have fun.

2887
02:44:25,180 --> 02:44:26,740
Fake Phoenix and fake Payne.

2888
02:44:27,500 --> 02:44:28,300
She's a rookie too.

2889
02:44:28,760 --> 02:44:30,300
Wait, so she's with them.

2890
02:44:30,560 --> 02:44:33,300
Oh, I heard she was carrying out some crazy investigation.

2891
02:44:35,820 --> 02:44:43,480
diamonds like that not even rookies like lynn i can't oh god
i can't do it

2892
02:44:48,740 --> 02:45:01,200
yeah but i heard she was special she's got strong ties to
inspector cabanella of the special investigation unit i plan

2893
02:45:01,200 --> 02:45:13,260
on moving up the ladder on my own merits myself okay what
just jealous you it's because the chicken i'm eating has

2894
02:45:13,260 --> 02:45:25,840
like a tiny bit of spice and so when i like use my throat
like in that way um my i uh i what's the word i like get the

2895
02:45:25,840 --> 02:45:34,720
spice all in my throat also i just noticed that the doctor
is blue i think he's not on our side i think he's with the

2896
02:45:34,720 --> 02:45:35,440
bad guys

2897
02:45:38,960 --> 02:45:40,160
Or he's a zombie.

2898
02:45:40,380 --> 02:45:40,860
I don't know.

2899
02:45:46,300 --> 02:45:49,060
Wait, detectives shouldn't be standing around gossiping.

2900
02:45:49,220 --> 02:45:50,640
Never know who might be listening.

2901
02:45:52,040 --> 02:45:52,920
Like me.

2902
02:45:54,460 --> 02:45:54,820
Ah!

2903
02:45:55,420 --> 02:45:56,500
Like me.

2904
02:45:56,840 --> 02:45:57,260
Oh, God.

2905
02:45:57,320 --> 02:45:58,720
He looks like a zombie for real.

2906
02:46:01,360 --> 02:46:01,920
What?

2907
02:46:02,860 --> 02:46:07,500
I think we can safely assume the cause of death was the
bullet he took in the chest.

2908
02:46:10,260 --> 02:46:16,780
bring the stretcher I'll look into the rest back at the lab
he's so he looks so scary

2909
02:46:21,320 --> 02:46:27,240
would you mind waiting here for a bit doctor inspector
Cabanella head of the special investigation unit is on his

2910
02:46:27,240 --> 02:46:37,160
way now they have to say his full title Dr. Luigi if it has
spice why don't you just dunk the chicken in milk so true

2911
02:46:37,940 --> 02:46:39,360
Thanks for the secret chat.

2912
02:46:40,340 --> 02:46:41,700
Special investigation unit.

2913
02:46:42,680 --> 02:46:45,060
What do they want with a case like this?

2914
02:46:45,280 --> 02:46:45,500
It's alright.

2915
02:46:45,580 --> 02:46:48,200
He has a big mustache, so he's probably got a refined voice.

2916
02:46:50,240 --> 02:46:50,620
I don't know.

2917
02:46:50,960 --> 02:46:52,740
But Cabanella is our top investigator.

2918
02:46:53,940 --> 02:46:55,040
We don't want him...

2919
02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:56,900
Want to get him all bent out of shape.

2920
02:46:57,220 --> 02:46:58,420
Or there will be hell to pay.

2921
02:46:59,560 --> 02:46:59,800
Hmm.

2922
02:47:00,900 --> 02:47:03,000
I don't see what that has to do with me.

2923
02:47:04,460 --> 02:47:05,520
So true, Doctor.

2924
02:47:07,500 --> 02:47:09,220
what Cabanella wants to come for either.

2925
02:47:10,160 --> 02:47:13,580
It's probably just a big lark for him, but it makes things
tougher on us.

2926
02:47:14,520 --> 02:47:16,120
Hey, watch what you say behind his back.

2927
02:47:16,580 --> 02:47:17,820
Never know who might be listening.

2928
02:47:18,380 --> 02:47:19,060
Like me.

2929
02:47:20,240 --> 02:47:20,880
And me.

2930
02:47:29,560 --> 02:47:30,980
Is that him?

2931
02:47:34,160 --> 02:47:35,360
Whoa, he's...

2932
02:47:35,360 --> 02:47:35,460
Oh.

2933
02:47:36,780 --> 02:47:38,060
He's kind of awesome.

2934
02:47:40,440 --> 02:47:40,920
Wow!

2935
02:47:41,340 --> 02:47:41,820
Wow!

2936
02:47:42,920 --> 02:47:46,740
Ah, the tension of a crime scene.

2937
02:47:48,680 --> 02:47:53,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, nothing like it, baby.

2938
02:47:54,740 --> 02:47:57,900
Yo, he's Elvis.

2939
02:47:58,680 --> 02:48:01,080
Oh, my God.

2940
02:48:01,460 --> 02:48:01,700
Whoa.

2941
02:48:02,080 --> 02:48:03,680
Oh, my God.

2942
02:48:03,820 --> 02:48:04,840
He's so smooth, boss.

2943
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Oh, wow.

2944
02:48:06,380 --> 02:48:06,720
Whoa.

2945
02:48:07,320 --> 02:48:07,720
Yo.

2946
02:48:11,130 --> 02:48:11,750
Oh.

2947
02:48:16,150 --> 02:48:17,230
Evening, boys.

2948
02:48:17,710 --> 02:48:18,770
How's it looking?

2949
02:48:19,950 --> 02:48:21,810
Inspector Cabanella, thank you for coming.

2950
02:48:22,650 --> 02:48:23,470
Allow me to report, sir.

2951
02:48:24,690 --> 02:48:25,550
Fine, fine.

2952
02:48:25,930 --> 02:48:27,250
You just gotta hold that thought.

2953
02:48:27,670 --> 02:48:29,830
I'm gonna make a little phone call first.

2954
02:48:31,350 --> 02:48:32,390
I was gonna...

2955
02:48:33,350 --> 02:48:34,550
Oh my god, I stopped.

2956
02:48:34,690 --> 02:48:39,410
I was literally about to say I'm surprised he didn't spin
around when picking up the phone first, but he didn't pick

2957
02:48:39,410 --> 02:48:41,250
up the phone and spy the afterwards.

2958
02:48:42,210 --> 02:48:44,670
So this is the head of the Special Investigation Unit.

2959
02:48:46,850 --> 02:48:47,370
unique.

2960
02:48:51,830 --> 02:48:52,210
Trick time.

2961
02:48:52,470 --> 02:48:54,010
Alright, let's... Who is he talking to?

2962
02:48:54,470 --> 02:48:54,930
Look at them.

2963
02:48:56,130 --> 02:48:58,790
Here he is for his big lark.

2964
02:48:59,970 --> 02:49:01,590
Aren't you going to confront him about it?

2965
02:49:01,770 --> 02:49:02,330
About what?

2966
02:49:03,410 --> 02:49:04,970
I'm going to make my report.

2967
02:49:05,870 --> 02:49:07,150
Yeah, that's about what I figured.

2968
02:49:09,550 --> 02:49:11,310
You have no spine.

2969
02:49:11,530 --> 02:49:12,830
You have no spine.

2970
02:49:25,470 --> 02:49:36,210
whoa deal me the deal how's it going over there baby going
how is it going you ask you'd like to know how it's going i

2971
02:49:36,210 --> 02:49:42,630
would say it's going well enough about fair to average if i
had to say yes It's going all right.

2972
02:49:45,590 --> 02:49:46,490
The star child?

2973
02:49:47,370 --> 02:49:49,850
Not the man I was hoping to talk to there, baby.

2974
02:49:50,490 --> 02:49:53,510
Do me a favor and put that other nice man on the horn now,
would you?

2975
02:49:54,150 --> 02:49:55,710
That's a nice fellow.

2976
02:49:56,750 --> 02:49:59,950
If it had anything to do with this park, I'm the one to talk
to.

2977
02:50:00,410 --> 02:50:02,210
I'm the guardian of this park.

2978
02:50:02,750 --> 02:50:03,170
Yes!

2979
02:50:03,950 --> 02:50:05,330
Who is this?

2980
02:50:05,550 --> 02:50:06,790
They do kind of look like Lottie.

2981
02:50:07,290 --> 02:50:10,150
Oh, get out of here.

2982
02:50:11,010 --> 02:50:11,490
Oh.

2983
02:50:12,130 --> 02:50:13,330
Sorry about that, Inspector.

2984
02:50:13,750 --> 02:50:14,510
I just got here.

2985
02:50:17,710 --> 02:50:19,910
Well, glad to hear you made it.

2986
02:50:20,310 --> 02:50:22,430
That other fellow just about threw me for a loop.

2987
02:50:25,370 --> 02:50:26,370
Yeah, a lot of heart.

2988
02:50:27,110 --> 02:50:27,590
Yeah, yeah.

2989
02:50:27,950 --> 02:50:31,170
Start blathering, something about being the guardian of the
park or something such.

2990
02:50:32,270 --> 02:50:32,850
Yes, him.

2991
02:50:33,730 --> 02:50:34,770
Sorry about that.

2992
02:50:37,490 --> 02:50:40,010
We'll start doing your staking out.

2993
02:50:40,310 --> 02:50:41,490

02:52:17,480 --> 02:52:18,740
Yeah, nothing like it, baby.

3004
02:52:20,180 --> 02:52:21,340
Wait, I need to go follow him.

3005
02:52:21,580 --> 02:52:21,960
Oh, oh.

3006
02:52:23,080 --> 02:52:24,780
Carry on, boys.

3007
02:52:26,900 --> 02:52:27,760
Good luck, sir.

3008
02:52:35,370 --> 02:52:36,290
Look at him go.

3009
02:52:36,830 --> 02:52:37,730
Even up the stairs.

3010
02:52:38,170 --> 02:52:39,110
He's so cool.

3011
02:52:41,130 --> 02:52:41,610
Oh.

3012
02:52:42,770 --> 02:52:43,730
Trick time.

3013
02:52:46,690 --> 02:52:48,370
Oh, that Inspector Cabanella.

3014
02:52:48,530 --> 02:52:48,930
He sure has a...

3015
02:52:48,950 --> 02:52:50,150
a strange error about him.

3016
02:52:50,990 --> 02:52:51,770
You could say that again.

3017
02:52:52,170 --> 02:52:54,310
And I've never seen anybody use stairs the way he does.

3018
02:52:55,270 --> 02:52:59,630
I hear he is dancing his way up the stairs of promotion,
that same airy way.

3019
02:52:59,710 --> 02:53:00,750
He's like the Joker.

3020
02:53:02,050 --> 02:53:03,830
And I hear Lynn is his personal favorite.

3021
02:53:04,550 --> 02:53:05,790
What's the deal between those two?

3022
02:53:06,870 --> 02:53:08,470
Hey, how should I know?

3023
02:53:11,010 --> 02:53:12,670
How do I get up there anyway?

3024
02:53:23,630 --> 02:53:27,070
Traffic sign, traffic code, umbrella.

3025
02:53:29,470 --> 02:53:32,090
I guess maybe we go to the park instead.

3026
02:53:34,890 --> 02:53:35,410
Right?

3027
02:53:37,070 --> 02:53:38,470
Let's check it out.

3028
02:53:40,030 --> 02:53:41,690
We live in a society.

3029
02:53:49,400 --> 02:53:53,420
It appears to be the entrance to a nearly deserted, dimly
lit park.

3030
02:53:54,920 --> 02:53:58,220
The voices of two young people drift over to me on the
breeze.

3031
02:54:01,980 --> 02:54:03,880
What is going on?

3032
02:54:04,580 --> 02:54:06,940
Stop the park from being turned into a housing site.

3033
02:54:07,540 --> 02:54:08,100
Protect the park.

3034
02:54:08,440 --> 02:54:09,860
The rock of the gods.

3035
02:54:12,620 --> 02:54:14,720
Sorry, but could you do that somewhere else?

3036
02:54:15,280 --> 02:54:16,280
I'm a little busy right now.

3037
02:54:16,600 --> 02:54:17,440
I don't have time to talk.

3038
02:54:19,020 --> 02:54:21,620
I suppose you think I'm a man of dubious character.

3039
02:54:22,100 --> 02:54:23,660
A questionable person.

3040
02:54:24,760 --> 02:54:26,860
No, I, uh...

3041
02:54:26,860 --> 02:54:34,980
But if an objective person were asked, they might think you
were a little suspicious yourself so true how does he get

3042
02:54:34,980 --> 02:54:46,280
his hair like that as two suspicious characters shouldn't we
take the time to converse with each other it's one way to

3043
02:54:46,280 --> 02:54:55,180
put it pal yeah oh boy all right just for a minute hope you
have a great stream today men just came home welcome home

3044
02:54:55,180 --> 02:55:05,460
welcome home nine thank you there i like your attitude i
like it very much let's relax and talk a while then the

3045
02:55:05,460 --> 02:55:10,240
knight is young and so are we oh man

3046
02:55:13,280 --> 02:55:19,840
is he flirting or i don't really know we have this leaflet

3047
02:55:22,920 --> 02:55:26,540
oh we can't literally go anywhere else oh no

3048
02:55:32,640 --> 02:55:34,060
back to the junkyard, I suppose.

3049
02:55:43,630 --> 02:55:45,250
Couple dead ends, yeah.

3050
02:55:46,190 --> 02:55:50,850
I was trying to get tired too, so might end soon-ish.

3051
02:55:50,990 --> 02:55:56,330
I wanted to end if we, like, saved one more person because
it kind of, like, gave us that save, but...

3052
02:56:01,160 --> 02:56:02,380
Oh, what's a dog saying?

3053
02:56:03,840 --> 02:56:04,200
Oh!

3054
02:56:05,400 --> 02:56:08,640
I think we can safely, pretty safely assume that this was
the murder weapon.

3055
02:56:08,800 --> 02:56:10,280
Oh, they found the murder weapon!

3056
02:56:11,340 --> 02:56:12,640
Can you not use the lamp?

3057
02:56:12,760 --> 02:56:13,380
It's not moving.

3058
02:56:14,520 --> 02:56:15,240
Oh, no, that pistol.

3059
02:56:16,080 --> 02:56:16,500
Is it hers?

3060
02:56:16,640 --> 02:56:17,100
Is it Lin's?

3061
02:56:18,500 --> 02:56:21,860
Same model as the pistols you detectives carry around.

3062
02:56:22,060 --> 02:56:22,320
Ooh!

3063
02:56:23,360 --> 02:56:25,440
You don't think it's Lin's, do you?

3064
02:56:25,820 --> 02:56:27,080
Unless I'm a detective.

3065
02:56:28,220 --> 02:56:29,260
No, I'm Lupon.

3066
02:56:33,080 --> 02:56:34,040
Lupon's cousin.

3067
02:56:35,140 --> 02:56:35,920
This is not good.

3068
02:56:36,420 --> 02:56:38,260
If it is hers, it's Jover.

3069
02:56:41,140 --> 02:56:42,240
weapon might be her pistol.

3070
02:56:42,960 --> 02:56:44,240
What could it all mean?

3071
02:56:45,940 --> 02:56:46,740
Trick time.

3072
02:56:50,100 --> 02:56:52,800
Yeah, see, I can't reach the lamp, and it's not moving
anymore.

3073
02:56:56,320 --> 02:56:58,240
This is the weapon that took my life.

3074
02:56:58,920 --> 02:56:59,580
A pistol, eh?

3075
02:56:59,920 --> 02:57:01,700
My memory seems to be hazy on pistols.

3076
02:57:02,320 --> 02:57:04,060
But I have seen them before, that's for sure.

3077
02:57:04,360 --> 02:57:04,820
Let's see.

3078
02:57:05,040 --> 02:57:06,640
This part right here is...

3079
02:57:06,640 --> 02:57:06,900
Oh!

3080
02:57:11,760 --> 02:57:12,200
Fool!

3081
02:57:12,800 --> 02:57:15,360
If you want to fire the thing, aim it in your own direction.

3082
02:57:17,140 --> 02:57:18,720
Lupine the 3.5.

3083
02:57:19,080 --> 02:57:20,420
Grupa in the 3rd.

3084
02:57:22,540 --> 02:57:23,740
I didn't fire it.

3085
02:57:23,960 --> 02:57:24,920
I'm the victim here.

3086
02:57:25,480 --> 02:57:28,280
This is the act of somebody who's jealous of my abilities as
a detective.

3087
02:57:29,540 --> 02:57:31,480
What are you glaring at me for?

3088
02:57:31,760 --> 02:57:33,000
I'm hardly jealous of you.

3089
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:35,580
Well, guess that proves it's a real gun.

3090
02:57:36,700 --> 02:57:37,140
Sheesh.

3091
02:57:40,080 --> 02:57:41,120
What was that?

3092
02:57:41,140 --> 02:57:43,240
Is that what I think it was?

3093
02:57:44,340 --> 02:57:45,140
The sound of a gun.

3094
02:57:51,770 --> 02:57:54,590
I've got a bad feeling about this.

3095
02:57:55,030 --> 02:57:57,370
Every time that phone rings, it's bad news.

3096
02:57:58,490 --> 02:57:59,550
It's like that old riddle.

3097
02:58:00,410 --> 02:58:01,110
Which came first?

3098
02:58:01,310 --> 02:58:02,190
The ringing of the phone?

3099
02:58:02,430 --> 02:58:03,430
Or the crime case?

3100
02:58:04,830 --> 02:58:05,390
Classic.

3101
02:58:06,250 --> 02:58:07,290
Classic saying.

3102
02:58:08,090 --> 02:58:08,870
If you say so.

3103
02:58:12,130 --> 02:58:12,530
Uh-oh.

3104
02:58:13,110 --> 02:58:25,010
doctors like anyway that was that sounded bad um anyway oh

3105

3109
02:59:01,590 --> 02:59:08,990
going to the super's office here he goes please doctor go to
the superintendent's office immediately.

3110
02:59:10,290 --> 02:59:11,550
If I must.

3111
02:59:13,230 --> 02:59:14,390
There he goes.

3112
02:59:14,810 --> 02:59:15,450
Shuffling away.

3113
02:59:16,450 --> 02:59:17,830
No one cares about my body.

3114
02:59:19,230 --> 02:59:20,090
What's going on?

3115
02:59:20,590 --> 02:59:23,010
Don't ask me, but something seems really, really wrong.

3116
02:59:24,310 --> 02:59:27,190
That shot sounded like it was coming from somewhere around
the maintenance building.

3117
02:59:28,910 --> 02:59:29,170
Okay.

3118
02:59:29,970 --> 02:59:30,290
Oh.

3119
02:59:31,030 --> 02:59:31,770
Uh, dial.

3120
02:59:33,730 --> 02:59:35,890
To the super's office.

3121
02:59:37,110 --> 02:59:37,910
Who died?

3122
02:59:37,990 --> 02:59:38,710
Oh my god, wait.

3123
02:59:41,190 --> 02:59:42,850
There might be someone that actually died.

3124
02:59:44,510 --> 02:59:48,230
Yet another gunshot rings out in the lonely junkyard on the
edge of town.

3125
02:59:48,890 --> 02:59:52,990
The sound gives me the feeling a new death will be waiting
on the other side of the line.

3126
02:59:53,270 --> 02:59:54,270
It better not be her again.

3127
02:59:55,650 --> 02:59:58,590
Apparently, I'm not the only one the Reaper is interested in
tonight.

3128
02:59:59,150 --> 03:00:02,970
But as long as there's anything I can do about it, I don't
plan on letting anyone else die.

3129
03:00:03,790 --> 03:00:04,350
Is it Lynn?

3130
03:00:04,830 --> 03:00:05,990
I hope not.

3131
03:00:07,530 --> 03:00:07,910
Lynn.

3132
03:00:08,490 --> 03:00:24,010
were you alive are you good oh we cleared it nice um what a
funny illustration it's just it's just the lamp riko thanks

3133
03:00:24,010 --> 03:00:33,830
for the 20 gifted thank you yes okay good we got the save i
am kind of curious to see though who died so we'll see and

3134
03:00:33,830 --> 03:00:42,570
then i'll end it here chapter four how many chapters are
there actually i have no idea changing a person's fate is no

3135
03:00:42,570 --> 03:00:52,190
easy task especially when their fate is death the scene at
the other end of the line is pretty much what i expected all

3136
03:00:52,190 --> 03:00:53,450
except for one thing

3137
03:00:56,780 --> 03:01:11,320
oh that is her no no hang in there baby what it looks like
some piece of trash shot her from the top of the pile of

3138
03:01:11,320 --> 03:01:12,400
garbage outside!

3139
03:01:14,200 --> 03:01:15,200
Here, let me take a look at her.

3140
03:01:15,520 --> 03:01:17,000
Maybe there's something I...

3141
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,120
Sorry, can't allow that, Pigeon, ma'am.

3142
03:01:19,940 --> 03:01:21,880
I investigate, and you super intend.

3143
03:01:22,220 --> 03:01:23,640
You have your job, and I have my...

3144
03:01:23,640 --> 03:01:27,500
I feel like they keep killing off Lynn so that we can't get
more information out of her.

3145
03:01:28,320 --> 03:01:30,180
So that more things are mysterious.

3146
03:01:30,880 --> 03:01:34,080
She seems like the type that would, like, info dump, you
know?

3147
03:01:34,760 --> 03:01:37,980
And, like, kind of explain things to us out loud.

3148
03:01:48,590 --> 03:01:52,630
Let's leave each other to his own profession, shall we?

3149
03:01:54,990 --> 03:01:56,250
Yeah, well, here's what I think.

3150
03:01:56,830 --> 03:02:00,250
How much of a pro can you be if you let her get shot right
in front of you?

3151
03:02:02,550 --> 03:02:03,870
Anyway, have it your way.

3152
03:02:04,110 --> 03:02:05,170
I'll stay out of your hair.

3153
03:02:07,250 --> 03:02:10,210
We got the mad scientist with his little pigeon.

3154
03:02:10,790 --> 03:02:11,330
So cute.

3155
03:02:15,310 --> 03:02:15,850
Oh!

3156
03:02:16,830 --> 03:02:20,300
Where did the bird drop it?

3157
03:02:20,560 --> 03:02:21,280
So cute!

3158
03:02:22,680 --> 03:02:23,220
Burn!

3159
03:02:25,480 --> 03:02:26,020
What?

3160
03:02:26,360 --> 03:02:27,440
He's so awesome!

3161
03:02:28,080 --> 03:02:29,080
That was so smooth!

3162
03:02:30,380 --> 03:02:31,360
That's not how...

3163
03:02:31,360 --> 03:02:31,660
Okay.

3164
03:02:33,340 --> 03:02:34,460
Everything's so goofy.

3165
03:02:35,800 --> 03:02:36,720
What took you so long?

3166
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:37,940
Quit dragging your feet.

3167
03:02:40,280 --> 03:02:41,540
Who are you to shout at me?

3168
03:02:42,160 --> 03:02:43,620
Now let me have a look at the victim.

3169
03:02:47,080 --> 03:02:49,920
I haven't even looked yet, but I can already tell you she's
dead.

3170
03:02:51,100 --> 03:02:52,960
Her second death of the night, actually.

3171
03:02:53,740 --> 03:02:56,020
Yo, it's like final destination.

3172
03:02:56,360 --> 03:02:57,580
You're fated to die.

3173

Your voiceover work for the characters was out so on point.

3281
03:10:00,440 --> 03:10:01,760
It was a ton of fun watching you play.

3282

3283
03:10:02,940 --> 03:10:04,840
I love doing voices and games like this.

3284
03:10:05,200 --> 03:10:07,160
But it does make me tired out a little bit more.

3285
03:10:07,620 --> 03:10:13,140
But I do, I've been taking a lot of, um, a lot of throat
medicine, um, lately.
