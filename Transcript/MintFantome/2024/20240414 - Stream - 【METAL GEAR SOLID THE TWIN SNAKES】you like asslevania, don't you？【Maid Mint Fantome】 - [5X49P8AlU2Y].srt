1
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,260
Oh my god!

2
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,110
Can you hear it okay?

3
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,480
That part sounds a little quiet even to me.

4
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:06,970
No.

5
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,030
Stop it.

6
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,270
No audio.

7
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:09,850
Stop!

8
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,970
I know you're lying.

9
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,010
What do you mean no sound?

10
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:14,530
Actually?

11
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,010
Wait, what?

12
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,770
Oh, you can't hear the game?

13
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,330
Wait, actually?

14
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,720
Now you can.

15
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,280
Really?

16
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,340
The game is actually silent.

17
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,000
So I'm just laughing to myself quietly.

18
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,260
Huh.

19
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,040
Oh.

20
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,680
I see why.

21
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,320
I see why.

22
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:38,780
I see why.

23
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:43,980
I see why.

24
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,460
I see why.

25
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:47,940
Okay.

26
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:48,560
Hold on.

27
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,140
Restart.

28
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,720
Redo, redo, redo, redo, redo.

29
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,100
Redo, redo.

30
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,020
Oh

31
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:47,470
Oh Go-shin-zama Ojo-sama

32
00:04:50,990 --> 00:05:13,710
say the line say the line boss for old time's sake kept you
waiting huh oh my gosh oh my gosh you guys welcome welcome

33
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,610
welcome welcome to the twin snakes baby yeah

34
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:29,370
No, I was gonna say the most controversial Metal Gear game,
but actually, I don't think so.

35
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,750
I don't think it's the most controversial one.

36
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,990
But, you know, it is one that I think a lot of people are...

37
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,850
Well, not... I don't know.

38
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,230
I think more nowadays, it's more like...

39
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,090
What's the word?

40
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:48,430
It's more beloved by people than it used to be.

41
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:58,770
I think nowadays more people are like, This game kind of
owns, because of how crazy it gets, you know?

42
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:09,130
I think, so for those unaware, this is a quote-unquote
remake of Metal Gear Solid, first game.

43
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,470
Thank you guys for those silver chats!

44
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,230
Thank you!

45
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,230
Gaseous Snake.

46
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,470
I have a confession to make, I've never played Twin Snakes.

47
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,290
I'm a fake fan, so I'm looking forward to this.

48
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,750
Awesome!

49
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,290
Me too!

50
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,630
It's my first time actually playing it.

51
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,570
I have seen some of the cutscenes, but not all of them.

52
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,430
So, very much looking forward to playing it for realsies
now.

53
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,170
But it is a remake of Metal Gear Solid 1, so the first game.

54
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,270
But it is made in the Metal Gear Solid 2 engine.

55
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,330
And so it's going to look like all kind of fancy and new.

56
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,970
And it's...

57
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,710
It's different.

58
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,670
It is.

59
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,230
It's different.

60
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:56,690
It's different.

61
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:56,970
It's different.

62
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:57,510
All right.

63
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,730
Thank you guys for the super chat.

64
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,590
Thank you.

65
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,510
Glad you're playing this.

66
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,050
I actually got into VTubers because of this game.

67
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,070
The VTuber had a siltry voice like sniper wolf.

68
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:13,130
But was replaced by a nerdy, energetic lady like E.E.

69
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:14,330
What?

70
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,110
What do you mean they were replaced?

71
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:28,350
The best explanation I've seen is that MGS1 is what really
happened, while Twin Snakes is what Snake tells people

72
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:28,790
happen.

73
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:29,810
You'll understand.

74
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:30,750
No, no, no.

75
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,030
That's not my favorite theory.

76
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,750
My favorite theory is that Metal Gear Solid...

77
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,330
Okay, so there's several theories, right?

78
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,150
First theory is what you just said.

79
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,510
That Snake is retelling the story.

80
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,970
The second theory is that this is Ryden's VR modding.

81
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:58,690
missions that he went through because you know in Metal Gear
Solid 2 you learn that he went through VR missions of Shadow

82
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,490
Moses to kind of learn how to be like Solid Snake.

83
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:18,090
The third theory and my favorite and my favorite is that
this is Otakon's retelling of Shadow Moses and that makes

84
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:18,610
the most

85
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:31,230
I think this, I think this is Otakon being like, oh my gosh,
and then Snake, he like jumped off the missiles and blew up

86
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:31,730
the Hinde.

87
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:39,570
It makes entirely more sense if you think of it as Otakon
being like, it's literally just like my Japanese animus.

88
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,890
Because he thinks Snake is like a superhero.

89
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,250
It's so great.

90
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,870
Otakon left in the part where he peed.

91
00:08:52,590 --> 00:09:00,970
what's under special oh i do also want to say um this is my
first time ever playing on a game cube um i did have a

92
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:12,290
friend when i was when i was a um a little a little ghost
who um had a game cube and didn't let me play that kid was a

93
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:19,590
jerk um i still hold it against him i would i would sit
there like because he was one of my few friends that was in

94
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:29,530
my neighborhood and So, I would go to his house and he would
sit and play Animal Crossing and I would just watch for a

95
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,070
long time.

96
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,890
He was always just playing by himself.

97
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,050
Oh, yeah, friend in quotes.

98
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,810
Yeah, friend in quotes.

99
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,510
But I also just didn't have one growing up.

100
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,750
So, and then I don't know, I just never had an opportunity
to play one.

101
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,210
So, the controller, the controls are very new to me.

102
00:09:50,990 --> 00:10:02,390
like as of as of as of like 30 minutes ago and I bought this
GameCube just to play the twin snakes but because I have it

103
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:20,890
now we can play more GameCube games yippee but I bought it
literally only for this game so um yep yep yep um so yeah um

104
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,790
What else?

105
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,750
Uh, yeah, so let's, what is under special, I'm curious.

106
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,710
Um, oh my gosh, wait, there's dog tags!

107
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:28,750
In this?

108
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,330
Just like in Metal Gear Solid 2?

109
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,690
The briefings are in full 3D?

110
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,110
Oh yes, yes, yes, we will be watching the briefings, don't
worry.

111
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,970
Because there's one part that I really love that Snake does.

112
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,470
There's photo album 2.

113
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,130
I don't know what this is.

114
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:43,990
It looks like a gun.

115
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,430
Previous operations.

116
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,590
Oh my gosh, Otakon's P!

117
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,830
Okay.

118
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,670
Let's do the briefings.

119
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,890
I think they're quite long, like the original briefings,
right?

120
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,990
I'm not sure to be honest, so...

121
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,130
It's been a long time, Snake.

122
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,310
He's got pants!

123
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,670
I should have known you were behind this, Colonel.

124
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,790
Let me know how the audio is, by the way.

125
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,970
Snake, straight to the point as always.

126
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,310
What do you want from me?

127
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,810
I just invited you here so we could have a talk.

128
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:17,810
A talk?

129
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,970
That's what you call sending armed soldiers out.

130
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:29,230
after me sorry if they were a little rough with you but
we've got a serious situation here only you can get us out

131
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:36,810
of it oh I'm retired from Foxhound you're not my commander
anymore and I don't have to take orders from you or anyone

132
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:45,730
else oh you will take these orders I know it you can change
move the cameras I can oh is there a way to zoom in excuse

133
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:54,630

don't touch me who's this Dr. Naomi Hunter, the unit's chief

134
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,890
medic, an expert in gene therapy.

135
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,470
Are you military?

136
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,930
No, civilian.

137
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:00,990
Right stick?

138
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,030
I'm afraid of...

139
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,390
Yeah, I'm gonna...

140
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,110
Pleasure to meet you, Snake.

141
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:04,470
Nope.

142
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,990
Don't touch me!

143
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:08,690
Oh!

144
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,370
Ah!

145
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,230
Oh, God.

146
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,890
I found out how to zoom in.

147
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,530
What's the shot for?

148
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,150
What's wrong?

149
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,430
You don't like shots?

150
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,410
No, I do not.

151
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,990
Snake, listen up.

152
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,430
It doesn't go any closer.

153
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:28,830
Of all five hours ago, an island in Alaska's Fox Archipelago
called Shadow Moses Island was occupied by special ops

154
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,410
soldiers.

155
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,670
What soldiers?

156
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,830
What is she doing anyway?

157
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,130
Next generation special forces, led by members of Unit
Foxhound.

158
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,030
Foxhound.

159
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:43,650
They've presented Washington with a single demand, and they
say that if it isn't met, they'll launch a nuclear weapon.

160
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,230
Take off your pants!

161
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,070
A nuclear weapon.

162
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,830
Also, how is he- I'm afraid so.

163
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,650
What hairstyle is he going to change?

164
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:50,930
He looks the same.

165
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,090
nuclear weapons disposal facility.

166
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,370
Foxhound, hijacking a nuclear weapon?

167
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,610
Five nights.

168
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,050
Now you understand how serious the situation is.

169
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,450
This is actually FNAF, you guys.

170
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,510
You have two objectives.

171
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,930
First, infiltrate the nuclear weapons disposal facility and
rescue the two hostages.

172
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,290
They are Darfur Chief Donald Anderson.

173
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:11,910
Oh my gosh, that's so cool!

174
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,050
And Kenneth Baker, President of Arms Tech.

175
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,510
Okay, I know those guys.

176
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,810
Those are some heavy duty hostages.

177
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,530
You're to investigate whether or not the terrorists have the
other camera.

178
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:33,190
Oh, let me try a trigger and stop them if they do oh Any
questions snake Questions I haven't even said whether I

179
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,350
accept this mission.

180
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,570
Oh my god, so cool.

181
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:41,270
Well, you can make up your mind after you hear more about
the situation Welcome back.

182
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,430
Thank you

183
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,660
Next one Oh, whoa Oh, here we go.

184
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,680
Oh my god, the music is so awesome.

185
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,840
We will know if this is really a retelling or if Snake's
dumpy is still as chonky as it is supposed to be.

186
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,740
I think it is going to be as chonky, right?

187
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,280
Next one.

188
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,800
Infiltration.

189
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,320
The insertion method.

190
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,420
So cool.

191
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,960
Wait, what if I do Z?

192
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,960
Okay, it doesn't.

193
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,780
The disposal facility includes a hardened underground base.

194
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:37,740
Even with our most advanced intelligence gathering
equipment, we can't tell what's happening inside.

195
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,700
Oh, Colonel!

196
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:40,760
Colonel!

197
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,060
Oh!

198
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,800
So, someone needs to penetrate, gather intelligence and
report back.

199
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,440
Yes.

200
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,560
No one!

201
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,280
What's the insertion method?

202
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,100
No one even bats an eye at it.

203
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,240
Sounds like a spy movie.

204
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,640
Not the hand.

205
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,900
The handgun.

206
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,940
The facility is equipped with sonar detection capabilities.

207
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,040
They'd be able to hear our engine or propeller noise.

208
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:14,900
Mm-hmm.

209
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,720
And then...

210
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,140
Oh, God, it's so goofy.

211
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,700
We'll launch a one-man SDV.

212
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,020
Launch.

213
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,140
Launch.

214
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:32,720
as a torpedo only this has no propulsion device of its own
bond james bond dispose of it from there on you'll have to

215
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:41,540
swim you want me to swim in sub-zero alaskan water oh oh oh
that suit represents the latest advances sorry if i'm

216
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:49,580
switching around so much the nuclear weapons disposal
facility covers the whole island i'll instruct you by coach

217
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,340
I think his dumpy is there.

218
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,180
You guys?

219
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,060
Anyone going with me?

220
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,700
Look at that.

221
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,720
As always, this is a one man sneaking mission.

222
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,700
Weapons and equipment OSP.

223
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,560
Why are you even here?

224
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,740
This is a top secret black op.

225
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,080
Yeah, we get out of here.

226
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,360
He's cheeked up.

227
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,800
I'm embarrassed to look down.

228
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,320
I'm embarrassed to move the camera down.

229
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,700
We got our time.

230
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,180
That was my favorite part though of the briefings that I
know of where he goes.

231
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,100
Seems like a spy movie.

232
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,460
And he does his little handgun and nobody laughs at him or
nobody makes a comment or anything.

233
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,320
Just, everyone's just kind of like, snake.

234
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,300
And then he's like, what's the insertion method?

235
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,320
Oh, it's so funny.

236
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,820
What's the time limit?

237
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,080
Oh, geez.

238
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,380
So exasperated.

239
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,120
They say they'll launch after 24 hours.

240
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,180
This is so goofy.

241
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,620
Yeah.

242
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,500
Do they say what the target will be?

243
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,180
I love this game for different reasons than one, you know?

244
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,060
They did the countdown start.

245
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,700
Five hours ago.

246
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,080
Okay, so it's not 24 hours.

247
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:15,780
Gosh.

248
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,640
Are you okay, Snake?

249
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,380
Why does it just stop there?

250
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,540
Oh my gosh, so funny.

251
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,400
Wait, how do I go back?

252
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:30,960
Oh, there we go.

253
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
Oh, my gosh.

254
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,940
I can't wait to see Unit Foxhound.

255
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,880
I can't wait to see what they look like in the...

256
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,640
Oh, I'm so excited.

257
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,300
Person in charge of the operation.

258
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,940
He's like, bro.

259
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,400
He's like, no, you can't be serious.

260
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,020
What is...

261
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,660
Oh, hey, hey, no smoking on the job.

262
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,300
Colonel, who are you speaking for?

263
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,060
She actually tried.

264
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,780
Naturally, I'm representing the U.S.

265
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,400
government.

266
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,380
She's still trying.

267
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,620
So he's in supervisory control of this operation.

268
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,060
The president of the United States.

269
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:10,980
Get him, get him, Naomi.

270
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:11,860
Oh.

271
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,040
So there's a lot of crap hitting fans in the White House
basement.

272
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,020
Now, at this point, there's still video conferencing.

273
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:30,420
with each other oh if that's a real nuclear warhead
shouldn't they issue a cog not yet the secretary of defense

274
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:37,040
has operational control come on is fully aware of the
situation just go in after you infiltrate if you determine

275
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:48,240
they possess nuclear launch capabilities a cog will be
issued red yo snake i suppose there isn't that much reason

276
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:59,660
to worry yet is the national security agency in on this the
power stats yeah the defense intelligence agency the dia get

277
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:07,380

sending us some support we don't need desk jockeys we need a

278
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:16,780
nuclear weapons specialist of course a nuclear weapons
specialist has already been assigned to us oh oh oh oh she

279
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:23,900
got him oh yeah yeah You get it!

280

That, you know what?

282
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,380
Respect.

283
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,560
She went for it.

284
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,500
She, girl, bust her way!

285
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,780
Let's see.

286
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,640
Support crew.

287
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,980
She's talking about Nastasha, right?

288
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,320
We need backup from a specialist.

289
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,560
Where is she?

290
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,480
Let her come in.

291
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,000
Enter the room.

292
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,680
That's why I've requested the assistance of a military
analyst Romanenko.

293
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,280
She'll be providing you backup by codec.

294
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,380
Oh, there she is.

295
00:19:59,680 --> 00:19:59,980
Kinda.

296
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,700
Let me see.

297
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,720
Let me see her.

298
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,020
Come on, Snake.

299
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,540
She's built up an impressive record as an advisor for the
nuclear emergency search team.

300
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,900
Contact her if you have any questions.

301
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,780
She's also an expert on high tech weapons.

302
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,540
A female.

303
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,220
Where's she working from?

304
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,100
Her home in Los Angeles.

305
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,080
Oh, she's in...

306
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,660
California.

307
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,260
Ew.

308
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,020
Ew!

309
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,800
Ew, California, boo!

310
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,800
Roy Campbell.

311
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,240
Our guy coming out of retirement.

312
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,000
All of us coming out of retirement.

313
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,600
Colonel, you're retired.

314
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,180
Why are you involved in this?

315
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,340
Because there aren't many people who know Foxhound as well
as I do.

316
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,440
Wait, if I...

317
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,980
Is that the only reason?

318
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,900
Oh, yeah, baby.

319
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,380
I don't know anything else.

320
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,360
I guess even though I'm getting a little old, I still love
to be in the field.

321
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,880
Why are you...

322
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,980
Why are you standing like that?

323
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:11,780
Oh, my God.

324
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,160
Oh, my God.

325
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,780
Tell me the real reason.

326
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,200
Okay, Snake.

327
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,220
Sorry.

328
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:39,000
oh take it come on come on I'll be frank a person very dear
to me is being held hostage who is it what don't act

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:54,040
surprise Naomi Meryl don't act surprise Pikachu surprise
she's like whoa you have someone in there oh oh my actually

330
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,140
I I don't even know if she does know about Meryl being in
there, to be honest.

331
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,200
Actually, not sure.

332
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,280
This is so fun being able to move the camera around so much.

333
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,900
What was your niece doing there?

334
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,160
Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the
revolt.

335
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,960
My niece was one of those called in as an emergency
replacement.

336
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,760
Aww.

337
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,840
Oh, he's got a picture of her in his pocket.

338
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,040
She looks like you.

339
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,760
She's my little brother's girl.

340
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,700
She looks like you.

341
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,680
And since then, I've been watching after her.

342
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,100
This is kind of messed up.

343
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,780
A personal motive, Colonel.

344
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,920
That's not very soldierly.

345
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,380
Oh.

346
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,580
I'm retired.

347
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,380
I'm retired.

348
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,320
And I'm your friend.

349
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,800
Aw, well, if you weren't really my friends, you wouldn't
have pulled me out of retirement either.

350
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,340
Barland.

351
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:56,960
Stance.

352
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,980
Haven't you had enough of a moody bastard like me?

353
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,100
No.

354
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,360
That's the part of you I trust.

355
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,320
Stance Barland.

356
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,620
Please, Snake.

357
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,820
Save my niece, Meryl.

358
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,960
She's just here.

359
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,120
Awkwardly standing.

360
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,000
All right.

361
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:16,720
Okay.

362
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,060
I have two conditions.

363
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,360
Name them.

364
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,040
One.

365
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,160
He's got that.

366
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,220
He's got that golem posture.

367
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,280
Snake, you're.

368
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,060
Gamer posture ponies.

369
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,700
I'll only accept orders directly from you, Colonel.

370
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,300
No cutoff symbols.

371
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:30,720
Oh, my precious.

372
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,560
Snap.

373
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,460
That's why I was called.

374
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,580
But one thing...

375
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:36,860
What?

376
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,180
He's not Colonel anymore.

377
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm not a Colonel anymore.

378
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,600
Okay, Colonel.

379
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,700
Just a retired old war horse.

380
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:50,400
Nah.

381
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,260
Naomi, what are you doing?

382
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,280
Why are you looking like that?

383
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,740
I understand, Colonel.

384
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,100
The way he scooted closer, so cute.

385
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,500
Why are they doing this together?

386
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,680
Ah, yes, we have 19 hours left until this nuclear warhead
explodes.

387
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,540
We're gonna, you know what?

388
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,380
Or until they launch the nuke.

389
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,700
Let's just kick back and relax on the bed a little bit, you
know?

390
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,540
It's fine.

391
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,640
They're so cute.

392
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:37,660
Oh my gosh, there's, there's, there's like, actual bros you
know it's so cute hanging out with the homies oh so cute i'm

393
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:44,780
naomi's third wheeling yeah just a little bit i'm invading
their privacy hold on is she part of this operation too like

394
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:51,040
naomi walked in on the wrong scene doesn't know what to do
she was in charge of foxhound's gene therapy she knows more

395
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,940
about those men than anyone else

396
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,540
She's used to seeing men naked.

397
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:58,860
Ah!

398
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
Don't sit like that!

399
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,640
Snake!

400
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,460
Snake, you...

401
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,340
You... Hey!

402
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,360
Snake!

403
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:07,860
Help,

404
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:10,980
please.

405
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,060
Wait, he's like, sat up like that when he's talking about
her being naked!

406
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:17,900
Oh my god!

407
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,180
Snake!

408
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,200
There are different types which will replenish the supply of
adrenaline, nutrition, and sugar in your bloodstream.

409
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,600
Now I don't have to worry about food.

410
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:35,620
I also put no that's snakes worst enemy or worst fear not
eating a class of drugs which will help improve your mental

411
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:47,160
functioning hmm it'll make me smarter huh anything else oh
my god the tension here it's a type of stimulant it'll keep

412
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:56,260
you now he's even looking away he's like now I'm third
wheeling that was quite a cocktail anything else in there

413
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,140
Those nano machines will also keep your codex batteries
charged up.

414
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,200
Poor Roy.

415
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:04,420
Oh.

416
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,160
I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet.

417
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,000
Stop!

418
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,420
Why are you doing this, Snake?

419
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,500
What?

420
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,500
The tummy rub.

421
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,940
The snake tummy rub.

422
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,300
Thank you so much for the donut.

423
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,740
I guess I could call you when I want to go on a diet.

424
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,740
Okay, last little bit.

425
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,980
Well, I say little bit, but it's quite a lot of bit.

426
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:40,940
That's okay.

427
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,000
Such a goofy old man.

428
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,880
He is.

429
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,880
The tension though.

430
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:47,720
Wow.

431
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,920
Okay, let's talk about the hostages.

432
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,360
Now we know the meaning of the twin snakes.

433
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,220
The chief of DARPA.

434
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,380
and the president of an arms manufacturing company.

435
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,280
What business did they have at a nuclear weapons disposal
facility?

436
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,840
Let's try this angle a little bit.

437
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,980
The truth is that secret exercises were being conducted at
the time the terrorist group attacked.

438
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,540
Look at...

439
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,780
Must be extremely important exercises if those two were
directly involved.

440
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,680
Were they testing some kind of new advanced weapon?

441
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,820
I'm not privy to that information.

442
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:36,700
do we know exactly where they're being held why is he
pointing his fingers um actually do we know where they're

443
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:47,860
being held i can't with the finger guts oh gosh sorry i know
i'm not paying attention but also at the same time i know

444
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:52,680
most of this already so it's fine it's more interesting to
look at the visuals you know

445
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:06,860
um actually do they really have the ability to launch a
nuclear missile they say they do they even gave us the

446
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:14,980
serial number of the warhead they plan to use draw me like
your french girl was the number confirmed i'm afraid so what

447
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:23,880
are you doing naomi at the very least they got their hands
on a real nuclear warhead isn't there some kind of Oh, wait,

448
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,840
no, no, no.

449
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,920
She's, like, massaging her calf.

450
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:33,000
Our arsenal is equipped with a POW, which uses a discrete
detonation code.

451
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,360
Gurley, what?

452
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,540
Pal.

453
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,560
Why did this is...

454
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,280
Wait, or she's pulling up her stocking?

455
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,220
I can't tell.

456
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,300
The safety control system goes into all nuclear weapon
systems.

457
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,700
What are you doing?

458
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,060
We can't rest easy.

459
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,880
We're right here.

460
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:45,780
Why not?

461
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,060
Oh, my God.

462
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,080
Because the DARPA chief knows the detonation code.

463
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,720
Yeah, she's pulling up her...

464
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:58,880
turn around snake do not turn around they have a nuclear
warhead it must have been removed from its missile all the

465
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,960
missiles on these disposal sites are supposed to be
dismantled it's not that easy to get your hands on an icbm

466
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,380
that used to be can't pay attention i'm just looking at
naomi press r1

467
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:24,220
also her her shoes are on the bed that's so gross don't do
that oh my god there's a in my room I think I'm gonna lose

468
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:35,760
it get out of here this is a clean mid cafe not a stinky mid
cafe where flies can fly around every every scene delivers

469
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:50,290
something new it's so it's like it's like a it's like a tree
you know everything is new how well armed are these

470
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:56,750
terrorists I know there was an exercise going on at the time
they revolted They're heavily armed, I'm afraid.

471
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,970
Heavily armed.

472
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,830
What about their battle experience?

473
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,350
The six in charge are plenty tough.

474
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,290
Why is she just standing man emoji there?

475
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,430
After all, they're foxhound people.

476
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,910
Hey, you're going to make me blush.

477
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,470
The others are next generation special forces.

478
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,910
They're not your average grunts either.

479
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,310
What was that?

480
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:24,190
That was like the most dramatic kick ever.

481
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,830
I can't!

482
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:27,690
I can't!

483
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,010
Oh my gosh!

484
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,350
You're gonna make me blush.

485
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,210
We're just...

486
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,110
What is going on?

487
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,530
I cannot.

488
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,690
Can we watch it again?

489
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,670
Yeah, that one was short, so let's watch it again.

490
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:43,890
That one was so funny.

491
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,110
Oh my goodness.

492
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:47,830
Oh my goodness.

493
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:48,170
Hold on.

494
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,090
I kind of want to watch it.

495
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:49,990
How long are these terrorists?

496
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,490
I know there was an exercise going on at the time they
revolted.

497
00:30:55,010 --> 00:31:03,810
armed i'm afraid there we go what about their battle
experience wow you let the six in charge are plenty tough

498
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:14,730
i'm embarrassed what looking at him hey you're gonna make me
blush the others are next generation special forces they're

499
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:28,290
not your average grunts either thank you good luck have fun
on your metal gear observation my gosh the kick is so crazy

500
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:44,110
love it i'm such a fan should have done cabaret so what
exactly are they demanding a person's remains remains that's

501
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:53,730
right to be more accurate cell specimens which contain the
individual's genetic information Cell specialities.

502
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:54,430
Stop!

503
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,190
What are you doing?

504
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,010
The terrorists need them.

505
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,570
You see, these next generation special families...

506
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:03,610
I didn't expect to change the camera and see that.

507
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,050
Genes strengthened?

508
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,390
You've heard of the human genome project.

509
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,110
Oh, gosh.

510
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,730
They've been mapping the human genome, and they're nearly
finished.

511
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,110
Thank you for that.

512
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,150
Thank you so much.

513
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:20,090
The military has been working towards identifying those
genes, which are responsible for making...

514
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,830
making effective soldiers.

515
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:22,950
Dun, dun, dun.

516
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,990
There are genes that do that.

517
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,130
Uh-oh, Naomi over here like, hmm.

518
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,070
That's so weird.

519
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:34,330
They're able to transplant those genes into regular
soldiers.

520
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,490
That's so weird, right?

521
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,650
Gene therapy.

522
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,410
Yeah, gene therapy.

523
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,450
I'll explain this part.

524
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,350
Okay, here she comes.

525
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:44,750
Okay.

526
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:49,970
With gene therapy, it becomes easy to remove genes that
cause sickness and disease.

527
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:54,530
or, alternatively, to splice in additional genetic material.

528
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,610
Why are you so quiet?

529
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,330
You know what?

530
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,990
I knew that Naomi has...

531
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:06,890
We can overcome all sorts of genetic diseases and at the
same time, add genetic characteristics as desired.

532
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,750
I knew she had no British accent in this one, but I
completely forgot until just now.

533
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,270
You knew what genes were responsible for making the perfect
soldier.

534
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,750
You could implant them in the same way, right?

535
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,530
No wonder they made him wear pants this time.

536
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,490
Can you imagine?

537
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:24,590
on being able to isolate and identify those soldier genes.

538
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:25,670
The genes.

539
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:31,650
And in order to do that, it's helpful if you can study the
genetic information of one of the greatest soldiers ever.

540
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,450
They un-Britished her?

541
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,290
They did, yeah.

542
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,470
She loses her British accent for some reason.

543
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,460
I think for the most part, um...

544
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,380
Well, Liquid still has his accent.

545
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:51,940
Genes.

546
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,300
Mei Ling also no longer has her...

547
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,880
Oh yeah, she doesn't have her accent either.

548
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,300
Yeah.

549
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,460
Is that Jennifer Hale?

550
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,060
Yes, it is still Jennifer Hale.

551
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:05,280
It is still almost, almost all the original voice actors.

552
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,380
Just a few changes, like, um, uh, uh, what's his name?

553
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,060
Um, Gray, Gray Fox.

554
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,120
I'm trying to think of the voice actor's name.

555
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,060
Uh, George, George, George, um, I'm really sorry.

556
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,980
I've, uh, the ninja.

557
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,390
um what's what's his voice actor's name again

558
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:40,660
Greg Greg Eagles yes Greg Eagles yes yes yes George Sears I
know it started with a G it's so funny because I actually

559
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:48,400
watched a video this morning about um about uh the voice
actors of the grim adventures of Billy and Mandy and Greg

560
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:58,760
Eagles is also the voice of grim so it's really funny
because it's just like oh my gosh you are you are gray fox

561
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:13,920
and the darpa chief and grim like it's what yeah isn't that
so awesome isn't that so crazy oh yeah i totally forgot yeah

562
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:24,820
grim fox it's so it's so it's um it was cool seeing watching
the video and being like i i got to meet him I went to MGS

563
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:33,420
con last year and I got to meet him and he was selling like
some prints of the grim adventures of Billy and Mandy so I

564
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:40,200
was like I was like yo that was like one of my favorite
shows as a kid so because I loved Mandy

565
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:51,480
Hater took a pay cut so all the OG VAs would come back
respect I love David Hater he's so the greatest warrior of

566
00:35:51,480 --> 00:36:01,680
the 20th century big boss big boss that's right we've been
working feverishly to identify the genes responsible for his

567
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:09,120
incredible combat skill oh so far we've discovered about 60
of the so-called soldier genes they have so much personality

568
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:18,340
when they move around you know i just love it so much so his
body was recovered after all yes and his cells have remained

569
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:24,460
frozen in a cryo chamber i thought he was naked for a second
oh my gosh information is a A priceless treasure to mankind.

570
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:25,840
Respectator.

571
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,160
No.

572
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,100
Priceless to the military, perhaps.

573
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,380
He's so awesome.

574
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,680
He's so good to his fans, too.

575
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,140
It's possible to restore his DNA profile from just a single
strand of his hair.

576
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,180
Oh, heck, it's like some kind of dinosaur theme park.

577
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,920
And you're going to put these genes into soldiers?

578
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,400
They already have.

579
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:44,340
You!

580
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,700
It's your fault!

581
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,220
By acquiring their skills through training and experience.

582
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:58,960
doing so we now know that hereditary factors are far more
crucial for creating superior soldiers i think he was

583
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:07,160
getting the dust off of his of his jacket we can't hand over
his body it's more strategically important than any weapon

584
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:20,740
of mass destruction checking the fly your zippers down
colonel the sons of big boss okay the sons of big boss

585
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,820
Dramatic stupid.

586
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,620
The sons of big boss.

587
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,240
Next generation special forces unit.

588
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,460
These guys don't mess with them.

589
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,760
They have an IQ of 180, everybody.

590
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,400
I'm telling you.

591
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,060
Don't mess with them.

592
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,360
Tell me about these next generation special forces.

593
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,080
Why do you look like you're about to jump him?

594
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:50,920
Oh my god.

595
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,220
Oh my god.

596
00:37:52,980 --> 00:38:01,160
made up of former members of biochem units technical escort
and the nuclear emergency search team their purpose was to

597
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:09,780
respond to threats involving next generation weapons of mass
destruction including nbc weapons until they were added that

598
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:21,800
is they who's they oh my god these guys didn't start out as
regular army looks like a pretty international group

599
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,340
mercenaries Look at them, look at them, their little
portraits.

600
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,400
And it gets worse.

601
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,000
So cute.

602
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,020
Most of them were from a merc agency that I think you're
familiar with.

603
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,260
They were part of Big Boss's private guard.

604
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,740
And after Big Boss went down, the military just bought out
all their contracts.

605
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,940
What was a one guy?

606
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,660
Oh, like the speedy fast man.

607
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,180
Outer heaven.

608
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,320
Outer heaven, baby!

609
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,960
After that, they were merged with our own V.

610
00:38:52,980 --> 00:39:02,140
R unit force 21 and running men if you ask me these
so-called next generation special forces should be called

611
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:08,580
simulating soldiers they have no real battle experience I
really hope we get to see decoy octopus in this video game

612
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:15,100
generation huh video game they've all been strengthened with
gene therapy and they're smarter they carry genes which make

613
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:20,680
them excellent soldiers oh yes don't get careless just
because they don't have much experience okay I thought

614
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:29,320
international law banned the military use of genetic therapy
yes but those are just declarations not actual treaties the

615
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:37,300
interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit
conspired in this attack what i think i like most about this

616
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:47,480
scene well until the static part is is the bit rate okay on
it on on youtube and like watching it like it doesn't mess

617
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,780
up does it Why do they keep talking about pants therapy?

618
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,180
Yeah, it looks fine.

619
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:54,760
Looks good.

620
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,520
Cool.

621
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:58,820
Looking clear.

622
00:39:59,300 --> 00:39:59,900
Good, good, good.

623
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,540
Even though it's all, like, kind of funky looking, you know?

624
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,880
What the hell is that gift?

625
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,180
Thank you.

626
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,860
Thank you.

627
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,160
Craig Eagles is still the DARPA chief.

628
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,240
Yes.

629
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,680
Oh, Rob Paulson.

630
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,680
Oh, Yako.

631
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,640
Oh, okay.

632
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,880
It's going to be interesting to hear it then.

633
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,620
But if they were regular army, they must have been
interviewed periodically by army counselors.

634
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,940
According to their files, they all got straight A's on their
psychological tests.

635
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,900
They all seemed like fine, upstanding patriotic soldiers.

636
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,220
They're so patriotic.

637
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,260
But they all took part in the uprising?

638
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:40,420
No.

639
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,000
Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise.

640
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,700
That's why there was a resupply of troops.

641
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,500
They cheated on their tests?

642
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,660
Was there any sign recently that something might be...

643
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,700
Also, I just realized?

644
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,180
For free?

645
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,620
Toes out?

646
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:02,600
Apparently they consulted classified information about the
soldier genes and performed their own gene therapy

647
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,340
experiments.

648
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,140
They can do that even that you do.

649
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,600
Oh my god!

650
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,340
Ah, don't get closer!

651
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:08,720
Oh my god!

652
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,140
Stop!

653
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,380
Not the way he looks away again.

654
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,200
Oh my god.

655
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,940
Colonel, please put an end to this.

656
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,020
Colonel, I'm uncomfortable.

657
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,580
Even the existence of this G.O.

658
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:19,840
Marby.

659
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,760
Yeah, get away.

660
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,480
Yeah, get away.

661
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:28,560
We had been hoping to investigate this thing quietly and
deal with it behind closed doors.

662
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,300
Shy boy.

663
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,440
He's a bit of a shy boy.

664
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,480
Be a soldier mentor.

665
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,200
Sorry, sorry.

666
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,980
Alright, last one.

667
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:40,460
Maybe.

668
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,960
Unless, I don't think they add another one.

669
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:42,460
They might.

670
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,200
They might add one about liquid, right?

671
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:44,980
I don't remember.

672
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,560
We'll see.

673
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,520
Unit Fox Island.

674
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,660
This is just how it goes starting a metal.

675
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:58,300
gear solid game the briefings are long special forces unit
foxhound your former unit and one that i was the commander

676
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:09,060
of an elite group combining firepower and expertise they're
every bit as good as when i was commanding them so they're

677
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:17,580
still around there are six members of foxhound involved in
really does have terrible back posture psycho mantis with

678
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:21,400
his powerful psychic abilities Wait, where's their pictures?

679
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,920
The beautiful and deadly sharpshooter.

680
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,900
Oh, he's like, wait, he's going through them.

681
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,440
Decoy Octopus, master of disguise.

682
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,860
Wait, I want to see them too!

683
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,520
Your oxygen!

684
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,000
Thank you.

685
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,360
Oh, is that it?

686
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:38,900
Hello?

687
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,920
Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman.

688
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,560
And revolver Ocelot.

689
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,300
Specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfire.

690
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:57,980
dramatic pause sounds like a bunch of cartoon characters
maybe in charge of them was he doing something that was

691
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:09,600
off-screen I don't know liquid snake liquid snake yes liquid
snake and you're the only person who can stand where'd Naomi

692
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:20,960
go hello Naomi wait where is she Naomi okay There was one
for Liquid Snake.

693
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:21,860
I knew there would be.

694
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,560
She Liquid Snake.

695
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,280
Oh, she was behind Roy.

696
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,580
He's just that much of a unit.

697
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,240
Liquid Snake.

698
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,780
The man who shares your code name.

699
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,340
The solid versus the liquid.

700
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,660
Tell me what you know.

701
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,040
Tell me what you know.

702
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,100
He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager.

703
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,320
The youngest person in the SAS.

704
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,420
In the SAS.

705
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,980
He is pretty sassy.

706
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:58,340
destroy mobile scud missile launching platforms you were
there too i believe didn't you infiltrate western iraq with

707
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:08,880
a platoon of green berets i was just a kid myself back then
oh the details are classified but it seems that originally

708
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,580
he penetrated the middle how do you feel about that how do
you feel about that he's a spy for the british secret

709
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,900
intelligence service but he never once showed his face in
Century House.

710
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,580
He was taken prisoner in Iraq.

711
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,740
Yeah, Asylvania.

712
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,760
You like Asylvania, don't you?

713
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:31,100
After you retired, he was rescued and became a member of
Foxhound.

714
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,500
I thought that by the time I left, they were no longer using
codenames.

715
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,480
I don't know his real name.

716
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:42,040
That information is so highly classified that even I can't
look at it.

717
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,760
Ooh, I know it.

718
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,320
Let me see.

719
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,500
Let me see.

720
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,480
Oh my gosh, wait, you can actually see it!

721
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,480
You can actually tell that it's him!

722
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,580
Pretty shocking.

723
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,240
His skin tone is different.

724
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,620
Otherwise, you two are exact duplicates.

725
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,680
I have a twin.

726
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,300
I don't know the details, but it seems so.

727
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,100
I have a twin?

728
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,120
That's why we really need you for this mission.

729
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,440
You're the only one who can beat him.

730
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,040
Big boss was kind of freaky out there.

731
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,520
You've got something that he doesn't.

732
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,180
Why don't I find that thought more comforting?

733
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,000
Why is he standing like that?

734
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,800
Why was he standing like that?

735
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:36,900
Like the Hulk.

736
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,880
Alright guys.

737
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,420
How are we feeling?

738
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,560
We getting a good vibe of the...

739
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,820
of the game so far?

740
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:47,500
Isn't it?

741
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,540
Getting a good vibe of...

742
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,120
What we're in for!

743
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,120
Oh, wait, no, no, no, no, no,

744
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:01,420
no, no!

745
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,520
Thank you!

746
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,720
Really digging the MGS telenovela.

747
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,140
Oh, here we go.

748
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,780
Oh, yeah, oh, the haircut.

749
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,880
Wait, did I just accidentally skip something?

750
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,600
Maybe that was the part where he cuts his hair.

751
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:25,540
Oh, no!

752
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,880
I thought I had accidentally...

753
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,980
I thought I had accidentally clicked on...

754
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,020
the file zero again.

755
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,220
Okay, hold on.

756
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,300
Maybe if I leave again, it will do it, right?

757
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,640
Let's see.

758
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,190
No, I missed it!

759
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:51,330
I'm so sorry, you guys.

760
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:51,930
I'm sorry.

761
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,250
Haven't seen this title screen in so long.

762
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:05,810
If I wait on this screen, I don't think it shows the video,
but that's okay.

763
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:16,390
I think we still see it when we do new game anyway so we
press on you have to select exit that's what i did i pressed

764
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:23,550
exit watch the last brief okay let's try that one more sorry
i do want to see it i'm sorry i thought i accidentally

765
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:38,080
pressed zero again let's try it liquid snakes wasn't that
long right just audio again i think don't worry oh is it

766
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,080

767
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,420
It's okay, guys.

768
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,420
No worries.

769
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,400
No rush.

770
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,900
Liquid snake.

771
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:48,840
Liquid snake.

772
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,600
My controller cord is like everywhere.

773
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,100
The solid versus the liquid.

774
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,820
Tell me what you know.

775
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,820
He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager.

776
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,340
The youngest person in the SAS.

777
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:09,160
His job was to track down and destroy mobile scud missile
launching platforms.

778
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,460
Oh my gosh, the almost convenient censoring of...

779
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,240
What if they, like, censored...

780
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,440
Like, what if Snake really was...

781
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,240
Snakey, and, like, they just censored him in, like, crazy
ways.

782
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:30,520
Kind of like how in MGS2 with Raiden, when he's on the
torture device, they censor him with, like, the straw from

783
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,060
the soda can.

784
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,380
Like, an Austin Power...

785
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,160
Yes, yes, yes!

786
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,180
I've never seen Austin Power's.

787
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,700
after that there was no trace of him for several years after
you retired i've never seen austin powers and became a

788
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:54,280
member of foxhound i thought that by the time i left they
were no longer using codenames i don't know his real name my

789
00:48:54,280 --> 00:49:00,880
um my mom never let me she said it was too inappropriate
even i can't look at it she was like you're not allowed to

790
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,580
you're not allowed to um oh my gosh You could see him there.

791
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,080
You could see him.

792
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:04,620
You could see him.

793
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:07,700
But, yeah.

794
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,100
Makes sense.

795
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,400
Yeah, she was like, you're not allowed to watch.

796
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,320
But otherwise, you two are exact duplicates.

797
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,240
The gasp.

798
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,420
I have a twin.

799
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,680
I don't know the details, but it seems so.

800
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,660
He doesn't look like he gets a haircut.

801
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:26,980
He looks...

802
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,340
Unless, like...

803
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:32,400
He looks more like how he does in...

804
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,960
In two maybe.

805
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:35,980
Now that I've met you, I know.

806
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:40,200
Maybe he's got like a little bit of a longer hair?

807
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,740
Like, it doesn't look like he cuts it that much.

808
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,460
The stance.

809
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,680
The stance.

810
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,560
Okay.

811
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,000
Okay, now exit.

812
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:21,160
it's okay it's okay we missed out but all he does is cut his
hair okay new game normal hard very easy easy I got I'm

813
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:35,620

814
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:38,940

815
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:39,720
You're a pro?

816
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:43,480
Oh, absolutely.

817
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:52,900
Oh, I am a pro.

818
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:57,850
Absolutely.

819
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:02,370
Mint, boss, big, big moss.

820
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:09,290
Thank you for the pink.

821
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:10,410
Thank you so much.

822
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:12,520
Let's go.

823
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:16,050
Uh, radar for novices.

824
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:16,730
Standard.

825
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:17,710
There we go.

826
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:18,730
Game start.

827
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:20,130
Yes.

828
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:20,890
Woo.

829
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:23,270
Woo.

830
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,690
Here we go.

831
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:30,210
David Hader.

832
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:31,270
Yeah.

833
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:36,250
Christopher Randolph.

834
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:36,910
Yeah.

835
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:37,010
Yeah!

836
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:38,950
Debbie Mae West?

837
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:39,630
Yeah!

838
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:44,030
Paul Eiding?

839
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:44,310
Yeah!

840
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:44,830
Jennifer Hill?

841
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:45,810
Kimmy?

842
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:46,070
Yes!

843
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:46,630
Yeah!

844
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:50,640
Whoa!

845
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:51,660
Whoa!

846
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,040
Rob Wilson?

847
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:55,320
Yeah!

848
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,020
Patrick Zimmerman?

849
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:56,760
Doug Stone?

850
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,300
Patrick Zimmerman?

851
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:07,060
The voice of Ocelot is the husband of Chris Zimmerman, who
she is the one who like directed all the voices and

852
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:07,380
everything.

853
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,600
Like she's so awesome.

854
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,040
Awesome.

855
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,480
Her direction for the games is just so cool.

856
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,100
But they were like, who do we get to voice Ocelot?

857
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:18,580
And they...

858
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,320
Look at the rats.

859
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,840
They just kind of like chose him.

860
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,840
And he was so perfect.

861
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:23,260
Oh!

862
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,660
He'll be through here.

863
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:26,660
Wow!

864
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,200
I'm going to swap down a couple of bothersome flies.

865
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,260
There he goes.

866
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:36,860
Liquid.

867
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,420
There he goes.

868
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,100
Bulletin some flies.

869
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,440
Cam Clark!

870
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:48,680
Yes!

871
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,400
He's so him.

872
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:54,920
I know.

873
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,860
It's so great.

874
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,540
Ooh, the sounds are, like, kind of nice.

875
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,400
Look at us.

876
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,540
Wait, where'd our flippers go?

877
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:10,840
I guess we just dug.

878
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,320
Nobody sees me.

879
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,400
Sneaky, sneaky.

880
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,000
Nobody sees.

881
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,060
It's good to have you back, boss.

882
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:21,700
Thank you.

883
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,780
Thanks for the super chat.

884
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,700
This is Snake.

885
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,060
Colonel, can you hear me?

886
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,360
Loud and clear.

887
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,260
What's the situation, Snake?

888
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:35,120
Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up.

889
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,560
Just as I expected.

890
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,280
You'll have to take the elevator to the surface.

891
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:53,460
sees you yep if you need to contact me by codec the
frequency is 140.85 140.8 push the pause button and then the

892
00:53:53,460 --> 00:54:01,680
a button what when we need to contact you the codec will
beep when you hear that noise press the pause button and

893
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:09,320
then the a button to receive the call oh the codec's
receiver directly stimulates the small bones of your ear no

894
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,980
one but you will be able to hear it My small bones!

895
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,220
Okay, I'm ready to go.

896
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,760
I guess it makes sense because there is no select on the
controller.

897
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:21,680
Oh, how?

898
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:23,520
Hello, Colonel.

899
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,880
Snake, you'll have to crawl to get through there.

900
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,040
First, crouch down by pressing the crawl button.

901
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:29,620
What does that mean?

902
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,240
And then press the control stick in the direction you want
to crawl.

903
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:32,900
Okay.

904
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:33,100
Oh!

905
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,520
Just remember that you can't move very fast when you're
crawling.

906
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:35,860
Okay.

907
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,560
You can stand up by pressing the crawl button again.

908
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:39,000
Okay.

909
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,060
Thank you.

910
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,060
Start plus A button.

911
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,420
Is there still the ration down here, or?

912
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,000
Oh, yes, there is.

913
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,260
I'll take that.

914
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:53,460
Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp.

915
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,100
Nice.

916
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,440
Uh, get up there.

917
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,000
Get up.

918
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,240
Okay, nice.

919
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,460
Okay, so why is basically triangle the action button?

920
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,920
Good to know.

921
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,780
And then crawl.

922
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,240
Okay.

923
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:13,700
That's B.

924
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,780
A is nothing.

925
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:18,760
Oh, X.

926
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:20,600
Okay.

927
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:21,880
Okay.

928
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:31,110
And then, uh, look at the rat!

929
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:32,410
Look at the rat!

930
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:35,490
Look at him go!

931
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:37,710
He's so fat!

932
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:41,190
Uh, okay.

933
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:43,450
Okay.

934
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:45,930
My cigarettes, my sculpt.

935
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:48,730
Okay, my ration.

936
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:50,410
Okay.

937
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:51,530
Oh!

938
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:54,090
Okay, this is first person view.

939
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:55,890
Okay.

940
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:58,350
Oh, don't, oh shit.

941
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:00,010
No, no one.

942
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:00,850
No one.

943
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:01,390
Ah!

944
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,670
Why is your vision so good already?

945
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:08,390
Um.

946
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,780
Hey, hold on though.

947
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,660
they're stupid they don't know they can't get over here

948
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:33,960
um i'm trying to figure out the controls can you leave me
alone for like two seconds the ration the other rations over

949
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,040

950
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,460

951
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:48,200
one 80 iq by the way um i mean He saw me.

952
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,620
That was pretty good.

953
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,500
The way he saw me.

954
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,280
It's not bad.

955
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,400
It's not bad, right?

956
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,340
Okay.

957
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,360
From...

958
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:02,940
From...

959
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:03,340
Okay.

960
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:03,780
Okay.

961
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,540
I have to get used to X as the crawl button.

962
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,680
That's so weird.

963
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,300
It's...

964
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:12,820
It's new.

965
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,300
It's strange.

966
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:14,880
But it's okay.

967
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:15,460
We're gonna...

968
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:17,040
We're gonna fumble a little bit.

969
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:17,320
Oh my gosh.

970
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:19,480
I just pressed the wrong button again.

971
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:20,180
This is fine.

972
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,640
We're gonna fumble.

973
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:26,460
Ah!

974
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,680
Wait, I think he saw me at the same time.

975
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:31,540
No!

976
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:32,920
Oh my god!

977
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:33,640
Oh my god!

978
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,040
No!

979
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,600
I was in a cutscene!

980
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,080
This is so unfair!

981
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,480
This is so unfair!

982
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,280
They won't come over here.

983
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,660
They also won't see me from here.

984
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:54,720
Oh my gosh.

985
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,200
Oh, how the water going down the thing is so cool.

986
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,220
Like, he's just gonna leave.

987
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:00,720
This is so messed up, you guys.

988
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:01,620
This is messed up.

989
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:09,200
Oh, please just go away so I can start the game.

990
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,860
Um, I think, um...

991
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,140
What was it?

992
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,120
Uh, there...

993
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,080
Okay, so this is crawl.

994
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:20,460
Okay.

995
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,320
Don't see me, you bastard.

996
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,080
Don't see me.

997
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,700
I need to go get the gun.

998
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,260
Where's the rest of the guys, though?

999
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:30,740
Hold on.

1000
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,720
Okay, this way.

1001
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,000
Alright, go, Snake go.

1002
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:41,440
Okay.

1003
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,320
We're not gonna let them see us.

1004
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,460
I got distracted by the rat at first, okay?

1005
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:47,880
But not this time.

1006
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,240
We're gonna flip this guy.

1007
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,220
We're gonna flip him over.

1008
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:51,960
I think it's A.

1009
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:54,700
Oh.

1010
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:03,800

00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,560
Oh my god, he's so short.

1015
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,640
I would have never seen you, pipsqueak.

1016
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:49,000
I would have never even noticed you were there.

1017
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,200
It was not accidental.

1018
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:55,520
For the M9.

1019
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,240
Okay, I think I can go.

1020
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:58,020
You know what?

1021
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:59,240
Alright, let's go, Snake.

1022
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,080
Ah!

1023
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,500
It's the enemy.

1024
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:03,220
I need help.

1025
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,700
Uh, uh, open...

1026
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:06,440
Start the...

1027
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,660
Start the...

1028
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:08,940
Start the elevator.

1029
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,940
Uh, you guys, this is not good.

1030
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,080
Um, okay, this is our first time.

1031
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,460
How do I shoot?

1032
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,780
Wait, okay, hold on.

1033
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:17,840
How do I use the gun?

1034
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:18,510
Uh-oh.

1035
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:20,460
Uh-oh.

1036
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,840
Oh, gosh, I'm fighting with my hands.

1037
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,300
Wait, hold on, I can't...

1038
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:26,960
Stop it!

1039
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,180
I don't know how to shoot!

1040
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,100
This is unfair!

1041
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,580
Wait, press A button to aim!

1042
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:34,700
A!

1043
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:35,560
A!

1044
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,120
Oh, I unequipped it.

1045
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,380
We're fine, everybody.

1046
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:39,560
Oh, no.

1047
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:45,400

Yes, yes, yes.

1053
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:31,320
It's just a little bit of, uh, a little bit of, uh,
performance anxiety.

1054
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,140
But we're fine.

1055
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,300
I wish I had my gun.

1056
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,800
Don't, don't see me here.

1057
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,940
Turn around and walk away.

1058
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,480
Don't get distracted by the rat.

1059
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:43,720
I'm sorry.

1060
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:43,980
Sorry.

1061
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,220
Don't get distracted by the rat.

1062
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,120
Where is he anyway?

1063
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,860
I think that guy's going to walk over here.

1064
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,160
I do want to get the other ration in the other corner.

1065
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,420
We can probably forego the one that was...

1066
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:14,040
What's the word?

1067
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,460
The one in the lower corner.

1068
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,580
He's going to come back here.

1069
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,380
He's going to pass us, I think.

1070
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,860
don't know their route at all.

1071
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:30,100
Oh, here he is.

1072
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,000
Look at you.

1073
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,780
Teeny tiny little baby.

1074
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:35,980
What is that?

1075
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,340
What does that sound?

1076
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:40,740
It's like a scuttles.

1077
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:43,720
Oh,

1078
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:48,270
there it is.

1079
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:50,730
And then there's another guy on there.

1080
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:52,790
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

1081
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:55,970
So I, wait, don't, do I need to press a button while I'm in
there?

1082
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:57,570
It must be why then, right?

1083
01:02:57,830 --> 01:03:01,430
To press the button or I guess.

1084
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:03,530
Snake made win.

1085
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:05,410
Oh.

1086
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:07,390
Oh.

1087
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:08,410
Oh.

1088
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:10,170
Oh.

1089
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:10,410
Oh.

1090
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:10,450
Oh.

1091
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:10,570
Oh.

1092
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:11,070
Oh.

1093
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:12,310
Oh.

1094
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:12,310
Oh.

1095
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:12,310
Oh.

1096
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:12,470
Okay.

1097
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:12,470
So it's A.

1098
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:12,470
Doki.

1099
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:12,610
Doki.

1100
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:12,890
Waku.

1101
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:14,450
Maybe not Waku.

1102
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:16,690
I don't know where this guy goes.

1103
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:18,030
Okay.

1104
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:19,450
I want to be able to shoot him.

1105
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:22,090
So once this guy comes back through here, I got him.

1106
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:22,730
Okay.

1107
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:23,570
So it's A.

1108
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:25,970
A and Z.

1109
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:28,490
Right.

1110
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:29,010
Wait, okay.

1111
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:30,830
Wait, how do I get out of here?

1112
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:32,430
It must be, why, right?

1113
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:33,210
It's triangle.

1114
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:38,690
Oh, hey!

1115
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:40,190
Get out of here!

1116
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:41,710
Lazy bones!

1117
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:44,730
Come on, get out of here!

1118
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:47,630
I don't know what their pattern is.

1119
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:49,570
Okay, it's why to get out of here.

1120
01:03:49,710 --> 01:03:50,870
We don't want to get out just yet.

1121
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:53,330
Are they gonna see me?

1122
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:55,130
Don't see me, okay?

1123
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:56,770
Oh!

1124
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:17,710

1126
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:29,110
I've never played on this tank thing holding the gun.

1127
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:29,850
Oh, I unequiped.

1128
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:30,110
Wait.

1129
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:31,790
I didn't unequip it.

1130
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:32,310
What happened?

1131
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:33,110
Missed.

1132
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:34,690
Uh.

1133
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:38,830
Why are you just shooting?

01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:39,390
Ah!

1135
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:39,930
Ah!

1136
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:40,610
Ah!

1137
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,280
Okay, he's gone.

1138
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:51,310
Uh, maybe I can get him from over here.

1139
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:53,450
Oh, dang it, you jerk.

1140
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:55,970

1149
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:33,370
of course getting out of the dang locker okay it's fine
though we got this you guys this game this game i just got

1150
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:42,230
to get used to it a little bit oh what is going on Oh, oh,
whoa, whoa!

1151
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:48,510
There, there's the Hynde!

1152
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:49,670
Liquid!

1153
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,220
Yo!

1154
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,920
Oh my god!

1155
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:58,460
Whoa,

1156
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:06,500
whoa, whoa, whoa!

1157
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,060
Oh my god!

1158
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,720
Yo, that was so crazy!

1159
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:39,200
also for anyone in quote curious i'm not necessarily going
for a full non-lethal um route because i feel in this game

1160
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:47,440
it doesn't make much sense i will maybe for the guards there
might be sometimes i kill guards but for the bosses i'm

1161
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:59,460
going to kill them because it only makes sense they end up
dying anyway so i gotta kill him ultra violence you enjoy

1162
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:06,880
all the killing it's snake i'm in front of the disposal
facility i took a long time sorry i guess you're feeling a

1163
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:14,160
little rusty don't worry it's been a while but it's all
coming back to me sorry colonel how's that age hasn't slowed

1164
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:27,560
you down one bit yeah not the call outline I'm grateful if
it weren't for your suit and your shot I would have turned

1165
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:34,600
into a popsicle out there Took you a long time All of the
genome soldiers in this exercise are using it.

1166
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:37,980
I see I'm relieved to hear that already Sorry, Colonel.

1167
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:40,080
I had coffee and it's making me shake a little by the way.

1168
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:42,440
How's the diversionary operation going?

1169
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:46,500
Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.

1170
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:54,400
The terrorist radar should have already picked them up Tew
Behind D?

1171
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:55,180
Behind D?

1172
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:58,720
What's the Russian gunship doing here?

1173
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:04,180
Oh no, I'm gonna have to fight that later.

1174
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:11,340
Actually, I'm curious how the propelling part will be.

1175
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:11,820
Oh.

1176
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,180
Who's that?

1177
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:14,460
Oh!

1178
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:17,220
I was looking at the guy behind him.

1179
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:21,440
Look what is in there.

1180
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:25,820
Oh, I see.

1181
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:27,000
Whoa.

1182
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:31,240
My controller's rumbly.

1183
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,600
Now's your best chance to slip in unnoticed.

1184
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:34,640
Unnoticed.

1185
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:36,060
Snake.

1186
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:37,640
Unnoticed.

1187
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:40,380
Unnoticed, Snake.

1188
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:47,260
There are only 18 hours left until their deadline.

1189
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:48,480
You've got to hurry.

1190
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,520
Well, whose fault is that for not getting...

1191
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,420
You must be crazy to fly hind in this kind of weather.

1192
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:59,760
who's that oh my god she sounds so different i haven't
introduced you to yet this is mayling mayling she was

1193
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:07,180
assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist
she designed your codec as well as your soliton radar system

1194
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:15,120
contact her like it sounds the same but different you know
nice to meet you sneak it's an honor to speak to a living

1195
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:21,860
legend like yourself oh it doesn't sound so bad actually
it's not oh it's wrong nothing i just didn't expect a

1196
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:32,480
world-class of military technology to be so so cute you're
just flattering me no i'm serious well i know i won't be

1197
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:42,460
bored for the next 18 hours what's this i'm being hit on by
the famous solid snake but i'm surprised i i didn't think

1198
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:49,580
you'd be so frank looks like no my name is snake it does
doesn't it Well, let's get to know each other better.

1199
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:51,580
But first, Colonel looking away.

1200
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:52,900
Colonel's blushing.

1201
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:54,980
Colonel, he's like...

1202
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,900
The bright dot in the middle is you, Snake.

1203
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:57,440
That's me.

1204
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,080
The red dots are your enemies.

1205
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,080
And the blue cone shape represents their field of vision.

1206
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,220
Okay, get out of here.

1207
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:03,940
Be careful, Snake.

1208
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:09,020
The genome soldiers have highly developed senses of hearing
and vision due to their gene therapy.

1209
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:11,580
Make sure you don't let them see you.

1210
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:11,900
Okay.

1211
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:17,000
First, I want you to infiltrate the disposal site and look
for the DARPA chief.

1212
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:21,800
The diaper chief was the same GPS transmitting nanomachines
as you.

1213
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:22,760
Highly developed.

1214
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,460
He should appear on your radar as a green dot.

1215
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,760
Get whatever information you can from him about the
terrorists.

1216
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,120
Okay.

1217
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:30,140
If he's alive, that is.

1218
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,040
Oh, he's fine.

1219
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:34,260
He's okay.

1220
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:34,800
He's fine.

1221
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,240
Why did you guys say it like that?

1222
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:39,740
But if you're discovered by an enemy, he won't be able to
use it.

1223
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,400
I think we need to upgrade our technology.

1224
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:42,680
It gets jammed easily, I'm afraid.

1225
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:46,060
Yes, it's all made from currently existing technology.

1226
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,480
I think we need to upgrade that.

1227
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:53,620
use it in an area with strong harmonic resonance so be
careful be careful we'll be monitoring your movements by

1228
01:10:53,620 --> 01:11:02,720
radar nanomachines mint contact us by codec anytime you want
got it i'll call if i'm feeling lonely seriously snake we're

1229
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:09,540
here to back you up so call if you need some information or
advice okay i'm also in charge of your mission data contact

1238
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:13,980
Which way should we go?

1239
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,320
I'm probably going to go in the way that I that way.

1240
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:19,560
Yeah, that one.

1241
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:22,780
One sentry on the left and one on the right.

1242
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,660
But we already have our gun.

1243
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:26,280
We can take these guys out, I think.

1244
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,120
There should also be a duct on the second floor.

1245
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:32,100
Also, since this is like MGS2, you can hold them up, right?

1246
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:37,840
Oh, but I've been trying to practice how to hold up people,
but I'm still not really good it is.

1247
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,060
So, uh, I'll do my best.

1248
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:42,940
The pineapples.

1249
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,840
Pineapple, pineapple.

1250
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,500
There's nothing over here, right?

1251
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,580
I don't remember there being anything over here.

1252
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,780
Um, okay, let's see.

1253
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,120
Uh, I'm assuming the zoom is the same.

1254
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,100
Okay, yes.

1255
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,780
And then it's X.

1256
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,180
I'm like, I was, okay, There's that guy over there.

1257
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,880
There's a guy up there.

1258
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:27,700
Yeah, there's obviously the spotlight's in the middle, but
there's a guy over here.

1259
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,540
That's our sleeping body.

1260
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:34,800
Oh, but there's also the camera here.

1261
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,360
Yes, yes, yes.

1262
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:38,440
Okay.

1263
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:40,140
Okay.

1264
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:47,840
Okay, so A, and then Z.

1265
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:52,140
Okay, we'll get this, we'll get this, you guys.

1266
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:55,980
Can I run, oh my gosh, how am I supposed to run though?

1267
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,020
How am I supposed to, oh, what?

1268
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,520
There's auto aim?

1269
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:00,980
Yo, no way!

1270
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,820
Oh, oh, oh, hold on, okay, wait, my fingers are all messed
up right now, okay.

1271
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:05,780
I almost had him.

1272
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,220
I could have gotten him.

1273
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:11,940
But if he faint right now, they'll notice I'm here.

1274
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,580
Do you think it's too far away?

1275
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:17,180
I think it's too far.

1276
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:20,480
I can't tell.

1277
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:22,800
How am I supposed to walk when I have all this?

1278
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,000
How am I supposed to do this?

1279
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:25,640
Okay, hold on.

1280
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:27,900
She's hacking.

1281
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:28,620
Aimbot.

1282
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:31,840
Let's get this guy.

1283
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:33,020
Never mind.

1284
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,660
Let's get him.

1285
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,540
I can't tell if it's too far or not.

1286
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,380
It looks way too far, right?

1287
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:40,520
Okay, wait.

1288
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:40,940
Oh, wait.

1289
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:41,420
Hold on.

1290
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:42,180
There we go.

1291
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:42,400
Okay.

1292
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,260
I'm just getting a feel for things, guys.

1293
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,660
I'm just getting a feel for things.

1294
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,220
Okay, so the quick...

1295
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:51,960
Oh, okay.

1296
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,280
The quick...

1297
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,380
Oh, this is...

1298
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:58,840
Oh, oh, oh, interesting.

1299
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,980
Okay, so if I hold...

1300
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:02,560
If I push down...

1301
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:03,920
Ah!

1302
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,340
I didn't mean to do that.

1303
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:11,360
If I push down, it brings up the menu.

1304
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,660
I can do that.

1305
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:18,560
It's like not so...

1306
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:19,920
Or it's...

1307
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:20,100
Okay.

1308
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:24,040
We're learning.

1309
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:24,420
We're learning.

1310
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:24,760
We're learning.

1311
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:25,180
What is...

1312
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:25,700
What is crawling?

1313
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:26,420
Oh my god!

1314
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:29,760
Nope.

1315
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,160
Nope.

1316
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:31,320
No, no, no.

1317
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:32,080
Get up, Snake.

1318
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:33,360
No, no, no.

1319
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:34,040
There's nobody here.

1320
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,280
Snake, we're still learning the controls.

1321
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:37,660
We can't do this yet.

1322
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:44,680
Oh.

1323
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,120
Wait, I can't move in first.

1324
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:46,980
Okay.

1325
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,280
You can't walk in first person?

1326
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:49,760
Why did I think I could?

1327
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:52,440
Unless it's just holding my gun.

1328
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:54,080
No!

1329
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:55,880
Come back!

1330
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:56,940
Please!

1331
01:15:59,000 --> 01:15:59,380
Okay.

1332
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,000
Whose footprints are these?

1333
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,740
No one's, uh...

1334
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:04,700
It's your imagination.

1335
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,920
No one's, no one's, no one's.

1336
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,660
Do I have to equip it before I go into first person?

1337
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:16,200
Okay.

1338
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:18,860
Come here, mister.

1339
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:21,240
I'm gonna get your butt.

1340
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:22,840
Come on.

1341
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,720
Oh, there you are.

1342
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:28,540
I don't think...

1343
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:29,580
Oh, I did get him.

1344
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,340
I don't have very many bullets left.

1345
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,540
And he's down.

1346
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:43,140
Then this is what makes the game a little bit easier because
of the first person stuff, you know.

1347
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:44,940
Come here.

1348
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,460
Do you think I can get him?

1349
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,600
Oh, I got him.

1350
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:56,420
Go down.

1351
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:59,820
There you go.

1352
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:07,890
I will learn.

1353
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:09,650
A surveillance camera.

1354
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:11,430
Oh, no, I got the wrong one.

1355
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:13,630
A surveillance camera.

1356
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:15,610
What?

1357
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:16,830
Oh, I can see.

1358
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:18,950
They're...

1359
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:19,530
What's it called?

1360
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:22,890
It's range.

1361
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:26,170
Is that gun still in here?

1362
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:28,470
Or...

1363
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:29,790
Oh yeah, there we go.

1364
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:30,390
Okay, nice.

1365
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:32,210
A surveillance camera.

1366
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:34,360
Okay, that guy...

1367
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:35,470
Go back to sleep.

1368
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:38,710
Go to sleep, little baby.

1369
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:42,690
Oh.

1370
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:44,630
Uh...

1371
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:45,330
Uh...

1372
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:47,190
We'll get him from this side.

1373
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:54,350
Close.

1374
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:55,950
Oh, I need to equip the gun.

1375
01:17:56,830 --> 01:18:17,250

1377
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:27,230
I don't remember did I forget it's fine if I forgot some
items we got the SOCOM though so we We can perform violence.

1378
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:33,930
But the M9 has the suppressor.

1379
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:35,730
Gosh, it makes it so easy.

1380
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:45,880
Hello?

1381
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,420

Wait, where's the item?

1385
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:04,960
They took away.

1386
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,260
Wasn't there a ration down here?

1387
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:09,220
Violence!

01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:10,420

1389
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:11,360
Thanks for the down low.

1390
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:14,620
They took away my...

1391
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:17,300
Null rats.

1392
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:19,220
Follow the mice.

1393
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:20,560
Where are they?

1394
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:22,580
I only have three bullets left.

1395
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:24,760
Maybe we need to be...

1396
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,520
Oh, there they are!

1397
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:30,840
Peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, oh, uh...

Okay, thank you.

1400
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:33,500
Yes!

1401
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:35,380
Master Miller!

1402
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:38,020
Master Miller!

1403
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:39,840
Oh my god, Master Miller!

1404
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:43,600
I quit being a boot camp instructor, so I moved out here for
some peace and quiet.

1405
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:46,000
I'm in retirement, just like you.

1406
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,460
Just, just, he's in retirement.

1407
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,440
Once in a while, I still help train the Alaskan scouts.

1408
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:52,360
Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?

1409
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,960
Campbell told me about the situation here.

1410
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,080
I thought I might be of some use.

1411
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:57,900
What skills does Kaz have?

1412
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,480
There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole.

1413
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,400
I'm actually legitimately...

1414
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,600
I actually don't know.

1415
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:04,020
survival in a harsh environment.

1416
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:06,020
I've never seen Kaz on the floor.

1417
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:08,060
He's always like...

1418
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:11,220
Burgers.

1419
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:14,380
My frequency is 141.80.

1420
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:17,440
Those mice are Alaskan field mice.

1421
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,420
Don't worry.

1422
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,560
They can't hurt you.

1423
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,200
Thanks, Master.

1424
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:25,780
Wild field mice don't have a thick layer of fat, but they
can still survive the bitter winters here without

1425
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:26,440
hibernating.

1426
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,700
They dig tunnels under the snow.

1427
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:30,560
That's where they stay warm.

1428
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,380
Survival Specialist.

1429
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,620
Start and A?

1430
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:36,180
But there's a dark side too.

1431
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:36,940
A dark side.

1432
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:40,320
Sometimes the males will kill and eat offspring that are not
their own.

1433
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,320
Are you sure they're not a danger?

1434
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,460
To ensure the survival of their own genes, right?

1435
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:44,020
Yeah.

1436
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:46,240
Pretty brilliant program, huh?

1437
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:50,580
If there are mice, that means there must be an exit
somewhere.

1438
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:51,920
Follow the mice.

1439
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:52,980
Follow the mice.

1440
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:53,840
What is it?

1441
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,080
Uh...

1442
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:56,500
Start plus A.

1443
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:58,360
Okay.

1444
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:01,700
Oh wait, it's already put in there.

1445
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:04,080
Well, we should save anyway.

1446
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:07,620
Sorry, the Soliton radar won't work in a narrow space.

1447
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:08,220
Never mind.

1448
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,540
Too much harmonic resonance.

1449
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:13,700
The radio waves produce interference and we can't analyze
the topographic data.

1450
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:14,180
Oh wait.

1451
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:16,880
Try to hang on until you get to a more open space, okay?

1452
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:18,900
Oh, wait, we're fine.

1453
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:20,260
Just kidding.

1454
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:23,180
New file.

1455
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,000
Okay, beep, beep.

1456
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:31,800
Don't give up, Snake.

1457
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:33,060
Thanks mailing!

1458
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:34,840
Wait, where's my...

1459
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,140
Um, excuse me.

1460
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,740
Where is my... where is my proverb?

1461
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:43,600
Didn't realize you like this franchise?

1462
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:45,840
Be cautious about the brain rot?

1463
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:47,640
AP.

1464
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:51,500
AP, it's over for me.

1465
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:55,380
It's...

1466
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:56,860
It's...

1467
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:04,600
When did I tell us...

1468
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,600
Those mice...

1469
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:06,380
Oh, yeah.

1470
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,140
When do we learn Nastassha's?

1471
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:10,520
I don't remember hers, actually.

1472
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:11,260
What was it?

1473
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:13,840
What was hers?

1474
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,240
My link sounds different without an accent.

1475
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,020
Yeah, 141.52.

1476
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:23,360
Oh.

1477
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,440
This is Nastassha Romanenko.

1478
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,760
A pleasure to work with you, Salad Snake.

1479
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:32,360
Nastassha!

1480
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,480
You are the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned.

1481
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:35,420
That's me.

1482
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:38,440
You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.

1483
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:41,020
I am also a military analyst.

1484
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,500
So sad she never got like a...

1485
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:44,220
3D model.

1486
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:45,760
She's so hot.

1487
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:51,380
They asked me to participate in this operation as a
supervisor from the nuclear emergency search team.

1488
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,500
She still has her accent, but it's...

1489
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,080
It's muted.

1490
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,260
It's way less.

1491
01:22:58,280 --> 01:22:59,920
I hope I can help you to stop them.

1492
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:01,260
You're a tough lady.

1493
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:03,020
You're a tough lady!

1494
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:04,840
Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear
weapon.

1495
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:08,300
The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen.

1496
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:16,540
yeah it's much more subdued all i can do from here is
provide you with information thank you nastasha that'll be

1497
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:23,100
enough another soldier here wouldn't make a difference
anyway it's good to work with you nastasha same here snake

but, but, but, but, but, but, why is it going down so fast?

1500
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:44,940
Stop, that's so messed up.

1501
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,580
I can't believe I lost health.

1502
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:55,880
Mew, meew, meew, meew, meew.

1503
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,760
Mew, weew, weew, weew.

1504
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:01,780
Weew, this should be an exit right here.

1505
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,220
Oh, no, it is not.

1506
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:03,720
Interesting.

1507
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:04,140
Okay.

1508
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,640
Where do they want me to exit then from?

1509
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:07,300
Hello?

1510
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:10,260
variant?

1511
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:11,700
Aha!

1512
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,400
I should have followed the rat.

1513
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:26,040
Did that hit him?

1514
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,780
Uh-oh, I only have one bullet left.

1515
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:34,720
Good night!

1516
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:46,420
How do I get up?

1517
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:46,740
Shit.

1518
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:47,280
Okay.

1519
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,000
I'll start and start, eh.

1520
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,400
to change floors.

1521
01:24:56,940 --> 01:25:00,640
There should be a cargo elevator that you can take down
somewhere around there.

1522
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:01,500
How do I pick them up?

1523
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,140
Try to find it.

1524
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,160
How do I, uh...

1525
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,040
How do I pick them up for the loot?

1526
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:10,340
Yeah, like if I can shake the bodies in two, right, it's the
same thing?

1527
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:11,840
What do I...

1528
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:12,460
Is it...

1529
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:13,700
Maybe A?

1530
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:16,240
A or B?

1531
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:17,260
Let's try.

1532
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:18,000
A.

1533
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,160
Oh, there we go.

1534
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:20,800
Give me all you got.

1535
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:23,120
Give me all you got.

1536
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:25,200
Give me all you got.

1537
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:31,300

Is there anyone?

1545
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:03,380
I think there's a guy upstairs, right?

1546
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:04,560
So he'll hear me.

1547
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:06,800
Oh, man.

1548
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,120
Okay, okay, let's see.

1549
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:15,400
He comes around.

1550
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,320
We'll wait for him.

1551
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,180
I'm going to lose my brain.

1552
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:27,320
I'm going to lose my brain.

1553
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:27,980
Please.

1554
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:29,000
Please.

1555
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:31,200
Please, please!

1556
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,320
Go in there, snake.

1557
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:38,460
Oh, why, why, why, why, why, why, why do I just let go of
the button?

1558
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:43,900
Why do I, why do I just let go of the button?

1559
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,820
Ah, it's so...

1560
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:48,120
Blah!

1561
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,180
Actually, this works though.

1562
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:56,120
Can you just lift up just a tiny bit, snake?

1563
01:28:08,430 --> 01:28:12,090
They're gonna know, they're never gonna stop leaving me
alone, then they're never gonna leave me alone!

1564
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:18,070
You can go away now.

1565
01:28:19,630 --> 01:28:21,630
Did he pull out his, uh, he pulled out his shield?

1566
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:25,470
The other guy is still asleep.

1567
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:28,450
That's some strong...

1568
01:28:29,790 --> 01:28:31,190
180 IQ everybody.

1569
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:34,570
Are their legs okay now?

1570
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:38,130
The guy's snoring up a storm over here.

1571
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:46,280
Don't wake him up, though, please.

1572
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:47,400
Oh, take it.

1573
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,340
Please, I have no more gun.

1574
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,460
No more bullets.

1575
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:51,240
Okay.

1576
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:56,220
You guys, this is just all so familiar, isn't it?

1577
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:58,760
Come on.

1578
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,340
Leave me alone.

1579
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:03,260
Hello?

1580
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,240
No more gun.

1581
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:12,600
Can I still use it, though?

1582
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:13,380
Even if it's empty?

You know what, let's just kill them.

1592
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:37,740
Or let them kill me.

1593

You guys can just kill me.

01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:42,460
In fact, I'll help you.

1596
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:44,560
Let's restart.

1597
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:52,470
Okay.

1598
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:55,910
Okay, it's okay because I didn't even have any bullets.

1599
01:30:56,950 --> 01:30:59,870
Okay, we're gonna sneak up on him and we're gonna...

1600
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:01,030
We're gonna get his butt.

1601
01:31:01,230 --> 01:31:02,050
We're gonna get his butt.

1602
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:03,870
The controls.

1603
01:31:04,490 --> 01:31:05,310
It's okay.

1604
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:10,820
One left!

1605
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:13,620
Wait, only one?

1606
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,200
I had two before.

1607
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:18,900
Hey, game!

1608
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:20,540
I had two before!

1609
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:21,660
You know?

1610
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:24,980
It's not really fair, I'm just saying.

1611
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:28,980
If I had taken him down, the other guy would have seen him
faint.

1612
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:31,040
Maybe he'll come back.

1613
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:34,180
Okay, let's see, where are you?

1614
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:38,300
Where did he go?

1615
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:40,700
Where does he walk to?

1616
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:43,780
Oh, there he is.

1617
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:45,140
Okay.

1618
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:51,360

1619
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:57,560

1620
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:58,720

1621
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,160

There he is!

1639
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:40,280
Radar, it's picking up the DARPA chief.

1640
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:41,660
He's the green dot.

1641
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:43,240
Hurry and rescue him.

1642
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,140
Hurry and rescue him!

1643
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:45,540
Okay.

01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:48,820
Um, oh, this is first person.

1645
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:49,220
Okay.

1646
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,120
There's no one over here, though.

1647
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,780
There's the guy in here, but we can't go in there.

1648
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:54,840
Blup, blup.

1649
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:00,760
I know to press the action button, Colonel.

1650
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:08,160
Pressing while holding the A will put down the gun without
shooting.

1651
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,000
I thought you had to unequip the...

1652
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,280
Whoa, I can't see anything.

1653
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:13,020
Oh, there we go.

1654
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:17,180
I thought you had to unequip it so that it wouldn't shoot.

1655
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:20,540
What's this?

1656
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:22,020
It's a sparrow.

1657
01:35:32,490 --> 01:35:33,750
Sneaky, sneaky.

1658
01:35:34,730 --> 01:35:35,290
Oh!

1659
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:37,390
Oh, it's Johnny.

1660
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:39,250
I hate Alaska.

1661
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:41,250
Why do I have to see this?

1662
01:35:41,930 --> 01:35:42,930
Ow, gross.

1663
01:35:43,170 --> 01:35:44,470
Ew, it's so steamy.

1664
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:46,890
That woman is built all right.

1665
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:49,450
Boy, oh boy.

1666
01:35:50,190 --> 01:35:51,210
That sound like goofy.

1667
01:35:52,410 --> 01:35:53,410
Boy, oh boy.

1668
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:55,970
That woman is built all right.

1669
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:59,990
Johnny, my man.

1670
01:36:01,890 --> 01:36:03,870
Let's get our bullets.

1671
01:36:08,890 --> 01:36:09,270
Yay!

1672
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:12,470
First.

1673
01:36:12,510 --> 01:36:13,650
First person down?

1674
01:36:14,490 --> 01:36:14,630
Wait.

1675
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:17,690
First person down?

1676
01:36:19,510 --> 01:36:19,650
Oh.

1677
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:21,410
There's no one in there.

1678
01:36:24,150 --> 01:36:24,310
What?

1679
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:26,550
What is that?

1680
01:36:29,890 --> 01:36:32,770
Are you playing naughty games at work?

1681
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:33,390
Oh, wrong way.

1682
01:36:33,570 --> 01:36:33,850
There we go.

1683
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:38,790
Snake is such a voyeur.

1684
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:42,370
Oh, gross!

1685
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:45,190
We don't even know be flushed.

1686
01:36:45,310 --> 01:36:47,310
We definitely know he didn't wash his hands.

1687
01:36:48,610 --> 01:36:50,350
Oh, there is a dirty magazine.

1688
01:36:52,530 --> 01:36:52,530
Nice.

1689
01:37:02,490 --> 01:37:04,110
Merrill, I'm coming for you.

1690
01:37:06,330 --> 01:37:10,230
Are you still doing sit-ups like you always do?

1691
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:16,010
It's weird that it forces... Oh, hello.

1692
01:37:17,450 --> 01:37:19,030
forces you into the cutscene.

1693
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:20,030
There she is.

1694
01:37:21,730 --> 01:37:22,110
Merle.

1695
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:27,170
A woman.

1696
01:37:28,690 --> 01:37:29,370
Not him.

1697
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:30,710
Oh, really?

1698
01:37:31,390 --> 01:37:32,150
Really, Snake?

1699
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:32,790
Oh, my gosh.

1700
01:37:33,370 --> 01:37:34,170
Don't look up, Merle.

1701
01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:35,130
Don't look up.

1702
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:39,770
Don't.

1703
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:46,870

01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:52,140

01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:01,300

Just this diaper chief right here.

1721
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,520
The terrorists are threatening the White House.

1722
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:12,620
They say if they don't exceed to their demands, they'll
launch a nuclear weapon.

1723
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:13,240
Oh no!

Ow!

1739
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:47,990
I had heard that the Metal Gear project was scrapped.

1740
01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:49,430
Oh my god, show the other side.

1741
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:54,030
On the contrary, it's grown into a huge joint project
between arms taken ourselves.

1742
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:55,410
Show the laser.

Tiny arms.

1749
01:41:06,670 --> 01:41:08,190
Is this Grim from Grim Adventures of Billy Mandy?

1750
01:41:08,430 --> 01:41:09,010
Yes, it is.

1751
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:09,790
You can hear it, right?

1752
01:41:13,670 --> 01:41:14,850
You can hear it a little bit.

1753
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:15,670
It's so funny.

1754
01:41:17,630 --> 01:41:20,210
Rex has fallen into the hands of terrorists.

1755
01:41:24,150 --> 01:41:24,890
Little by.

1756
01:41:25,110 --> 01:41:25,870

Psycho Mantis

1923
01:54:52,210 --> 01:55:01,500
Wait Thank you Are you saying that to me or snake?

1924
01:55:03,540 --> 01:55:05,760
I mean, wait, are you saying that to Merrill or snake?

1925
01:55:07,220 --> 01:55:07,940
Not me, sorry.

1926
01:55:08,420 --> 01:55:08,760
Got a little.

1927
01:55:10,380 --> 01:55:12,360
A little, you know.

1928
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:19,450
Naomi, I just had some kind of hallucination.

1929
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:22,390
Naomi, I'm going kind of crazy.

1930
01:55:25,410 --> 01:55:26,750
Self-insert caught.

1931
01:55:27,110 --> 01:55:27,590
No.

1932
01:55:28,530 --> 01:55:30,250
It's coming from Psycho Mantis.

1933
01:55:30,750 --> 01:55:31,670
Foxhound's psychic.

1934
01:55:32,230 --> 01:55:34,250
Think of it as a mental feedback loop.

1935
01:55:35,310 --> 01:55:37,010
So that was Mantis.

1936
01:55:37,370 --> 01:55:40,530
I would say that that scene...

1937
01:55:42,010 --> 01:55:45,530
It doesn't spoil, but it does...

1938
01:55:46,110 --> 01:55:48,490
Oh, I'm bleeding out.

1939
01:55:49,390 --> 01:55:50,490
Um, snake.

1940
01:55:50,830 --> 01:55:51,330
There we go.

1941
01:55:52,150 --> 01:55:52,710
There you go.

1942
01:55:53,330 --> 01:55:53,990
Stop bleeding!

1943
01:55:54,530 --> 01:55:54,910
Stop!

1944
01:55:55,430 --> 01:55:56,610
You're getting your messy!

1945
01:55:56,770 --> 01:55:58,090
You're messying up the floor!

1946
01:55:59,790 --> 01:56:00,510
We're good?

1947
01:56:01,910 --> 01:56:02,110
Okay.

1948
01:56:03,530 --> 01:56:05,490
Uh, oh, they're all gone even.

1949
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:08,530
Well, almost.

1950
01:56:11,910 --> 01:56:13,510
Anything under here I can't remember.

1951
01:56:15,890 --> 01:56:16,170
Nope.

1952
01:56:19,690 --> 01:56:24,770
But there is stuff in here that we saw in the pot.

1953
01:56:24,910 --> 01:56:26,130
Wait, is there anything in here?

1954
01:56:27,050 --> 01:56:28,650
Oh, ha ha.

1955
01:56:30,570 --> 01:56:31,530
Very good.

1956
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:33,990
Very good.

1957
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:38,300
Hacking.

1958
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:41,800
What is it?

1959
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:44,940
Is that the nuclear warheads building?

1960
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:45,920
No.

1961
01:56:46,300 --> 01:56:46,640
Oh, no.

1962
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:48,120
This is the first... Okay, wait.

1963
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:49,900
Because that looks like the tank.

1964
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:51,640
And then... Okay.

1965
01:56:51,860 --> 01:56:53,300
No, this is just the building that we're in.

1966
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:54,620
Oh, I see it.

1967
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:55,980
We are missions.

1968
01:56:56,080 --> 01:57:03,140
No, I think that top one is the floor we were just at the
floor you sneak into and then the second right but then

1969
01:57:03,140 --> 01:57:09,700
there but there's no tank on this floor i don't know

1970
01:57:12,890 --> 01:57:20,160
actually i don't think there is what's this one six and then
there's nothing else right

1971
01:57:23,610 --> 01:57:31,610
wait what is this oh come on thank Re-angle.

1972
01:57:32,210 --> 01:57:34,330
Re-re-re-adjust.

1973
01:57:35,450 --> 01:57:36,170
Okay, there we go.

1974
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:39,370
Just unequip the gun.

1975
01:57:39,930 --> 01:57:41,010
Unequip the gun, mint!

1976
01:57:45,130 --> 01:57:47,970
X is for shooting.

1977
01:57:54,070 --> 01:57:56,490
I mean, no, X is for crawling!

1978
01:58:05,850 --> 01:58:07,590
Oh my god.

1979
01:58:10,530 --> 01:58:12,490
X is for crawling.

1980
01:58:13,470 --> 01:58:15,050
B is for fight.

1981
01:58:20,130 --> 01:58:21,350
There's nothing under the desk, is there?

1982
01:58:21,610 --> 01:58:22,730
Actually, I didn't think about it.

1983
01:58:25,510 --> 01:58:27,230
X is for crawling.

1984
01:58:27,810 --> 01:58:29,110
A is to shoot.

1985
01:58:29,850 --> 01:58:31,170
A is to shoot.

1986
01:58:31,550 --> 01:58:32,970
And X is to crawl.

1987
01:58:33,150 --> 01:58:36,850
A is to shoot, and you shoot good.

1988
01:58:37,270 --> 01:58:39,790
Unequip if you don't want to waste your bullet.

1989
01:58:53,060 --> 01:58:54,800
I'm going to check under the desk real quick.

1990
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:56,360
Oh, oh.

1991
01:58:57,140 --> 01:58:57,600
What the?

1992
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:02,120
Oh, I was like, what is that spinning thing on the radar?

1993
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:03,760
But it's thingy.

1994
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:04,400
That's so funny.

1995
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:08,380
Nothing.

1996
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:10,080
Let's get out of here.

1997
01:59:12,340 --> 01:59:13,520
So now we...

1998
01:59:14,540 --> 01:59:15,420
Go fight.

1999
01:59:17,060 --> 01:59:17,180
Aw.

2000
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:20,120
Now we go fight.

2001
01:59:20,660 --> 01:59:22,420
Well, first we go explode.

2002
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:24,920
Beep.

2003
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:26,040
Beep.

2004
01:59:34,110 --> 01:59:38,990
I remember some of the guard chokeout noises in this game
being particularly over the top and silly if you want a good

2005
01:59:38,990 --> 01:59:39,270
laugh.

2006
01:59:39,570 --> 01:59:39,950
I...

2007
01:59:39,950 --> 01:59:40,350
Chris?

2008
01:59:41,110 --> 01:59:41,770
Thank you.

2009
01:59:41,890 --> 01:59:42,850
Not backseating at all.

2010
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:44,230
I'm letting you know.

2011
01:59:44,350 --> 01:59:44,910
I'm trying.

2012
01:59:45,430 --> 01:59:47,490
I'm so bad at getting the guys sometimes.

2013
01:59:47,950 --> 01:59:48,570
Not sometimes.

2014
01:59:48,750 --> 01:59:49,850
Like, almost all the time.

2015
01:59:50,090 --> 01:59:50,870
But, you know.

2016
01:59:53,710 --> 01:59:54,170
Um.

2017
01:59:55,990 --> 01:59:58,570
Which floors cave in?

2018
01:59:59,130 --> 02:00:00,910
Uh, let's, um...

2019
02:00:00,910 --> 02:00:02,290
Uh, start A.

2020
02:00:04,230 --> 02:00:04,510
Um.

2021
02:00:07,430 --> 02:00:08,630
What is it, Snake?

2022
02:00:09,110 --> 02:00:11,990
Hey, I'm just saving for no big reason.

2023
02:00:12,870 --> 02:00:14,750
Not that I think I'm gonna...

2024
02:00:14,750 --> 02:00:18,690
Why can't I be, like, riding and do a little cart flip...

2025
02:00:18,690 --> 02:00:19,990
Cart wheel over it, you know?

2026
02:00:22,990 --> 02:00:24,110
Thank you.

2027
02:00:25,330 --> 02:00:28,910
Snake, like Shakespeare said, knots had all spent.

2028
02:00:29,310 --> 02:00:32,990
First they take your accents and now you're quoting a
Western guy?

2029
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:33,790
No!

2030
02:00:35,930 --> 02:00:37,970
That goes for items too.

2031
02:00:38,510 --> 02:00:40,350
Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry.

2032
02:00:41,170 --> 02:00:41,930
Be careful, Snake.

2033
02:00:42,630 --> 02:00:43,510
I hate that one.

2034
02:00:44,210 --> 02:00:45,130
I'm not gonna listen.

2035
02:00:49,590 --> 02:00:54,870
I should... I feel like I should be calling codec more
because i don't know how many things are different but also

2036
02:00:54,870 --> 02:01:04,210
it's fun to talk to them right try to think your mind is
your most dangerous weapon he's telling me i'm dumb try to

2037
02:01:04,210 --> 02:01:13,930
simplify your thoughts i'm simplifying try calling campbell
for advice thank you thank you so much nastasha what do you

2038
02:01:13,930 --> 02:01:21,890
have to say they were conducting exercises with this new
metal gear prototype is that what the darpa chief said yeah

2039
02:01:21,890 --> 02:01:29,690
it is what the hell so you know about metal gear what the
hell just rumors i heard it was some kind of walking tank

2040
02:01:29,690 --> 02:01:37,670
that can deliver an accurate nuclear strike from any terrain
mountains desert swamps wherever wherever whatever whatever

2041
02:01:37,670 --> 02:01:45,690
as long as metal gear i'll be here and you'll be near but
what about the pal system that the darpa chief mentioned it

2042
02:01:45,690 --> 02:01:53,350
is a device attached to a nuclear weapon system to prevent
the missile from being armed or launched Usually a secret

2043
02:01:53,350 --> 02:01:57,550
detonation code or combination is necessary to launch the
missile.

2044
02:01:57,570 --> 02:01:58,050
The missile.

2045
02:01:58,290 --> 02:02:02,070
According to the chief, there are two codes and the
terrorists already know one of them.

2046
02:02:02,230 --> 02:02:02,470
Uh-oh.

2047
02:02:02,530 --> 02:02:03,370
The other code.

2048
02:02:04,250 --> 02:02:05,990
If the terrorists find out that one too.

2049
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:06,930
Do they, though?

2050
02:02:06,930 --> 02:02:07,170
Yeah.

2051
02:02:07,570 --> 02:02:08,090
Because he's dead.

2052
02:02:08,150 --> 02:02:09,870
I gotta hurry and rescue President Baker.

2053
02:02:10,470 --> 02:02:11,030
Do they know?

2054
02:02:11,570 --> 02:02:13,570
Because one of them is dead.

2055
02:02:14,710 --> 02:02:15,030
Okay.

2056
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:17,290
I don't remember.

2057
02:02:17,410 --> 02:02:18,570
Let's try down here.

2058
02:02:18,810 --> 02:02:19,210
Run!

2059
02:02:20,450 --> 02:02:21,350
Uh, three.

2060
02:02:28,540 --> 02:02:30,900
Is this a trap?

2061
02:02:36,690 --> 02:02:37,250
Wow!

2062
02:02:37,630 --> 02:02:41,450
That actually makes your health go down way faster than it
did before.

2063
02:02:44,810 --> 02:02:46,670
Is this one a trap?

2064
02:02:47,790 --> 02:02:48,830
Well, no.

2065
02:02:49,170 --> 02:02:50,730
No, it's not, because we need the sea floor.

2066
02:02:51,590 --> 02:02:51,650
Right?

2067
02:02:52,230 --> 02:02:52,730
You know what?

2068
02:02:52,730 --> 02:02:53,870
I'm just gonna crawl anyway.

2069
02:02:55,310 --> 02:02:56,570
Crawl, crawl, crawl.

2070
02:02:57,190 --> 02:02:57,410
Crawl, crawl.

2071
02:02:57,550 --> 02:03:00,050
Crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl.

2072
02:03:00,350 --> 02:03:00,770
Crawl, crawl.

2073
02:03:01,030 --> 02:03:01,830
Oh, don't get up, Snake.

2074
02:03:03,230 --> 02:03:04,170
Crawl, crawl, crawl.

2075
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:05,830
Just in case.

2076
02:03:06,130 --> 02:03:07,030
I don't think it is, though.

2077
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:10,550
Oh, I think we're good.

2078
02:03:13,690 --> 02:03:13,890
Hula!

2079
02:03:14,170 --> 02:03:17,980
Am I gonna regret this later?

2080
02:03:21,740 --> 02:03:22,700
More C4!

2081
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:25,680
Nice.

2082
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:27,680
Wait, there's so much C4.

2083
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:30,280
Uh...

2084
02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:33,920
I think we...

2085
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:36,240
Uh...

2086
02:03:37,980 --> 02:03:38,780
Oopsie.

2087
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:41,880
Oopsie.

2088
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:42,720
Run!

2089
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:45,040
Oh, I thought that...

2090
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:45,820
I thought that was a hole.

2091
02:03:46,980 --> 02:03:47,260
One.

2092
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:48,760
Grenades?

2093
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:55,560
Is this what a trap?

2094
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:02,040
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2095
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:04,100
Oh.

2096
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:07,500
Is this one a trap?

2097
02:04:09,540 --> 02:04:10,940
It says no smoking.

2098
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:14,740
I can't...

2099
02:04:14,740 --> 02:04:14,920
Wait.

2100
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:17,400
Why is she paranoid?

2101
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:20,560
Because sometimes there's traps.

2102
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:22,540
Wait, that's two of them.

2103
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:24,080
Wait, did that say Famous?

2104
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:25,240
Oh!

2105
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:27,820
Guess we know where to get the Famous.

2106
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:29,680
Wait, are they all labeled?

2107
02:04:29,820 --> 02:04:30,400
That's so cute.

2108
02:04:33,100 --> 02:04:33,580
Grenade?

2109
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:37,040
Okay, does this one...

2110
02:04:38,540 --> 02:04:39,100
PSG?

2111
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:43,040
Were they C4?

2112
02:04:43,580 --> 02:04:44,660
Were they labeled...

2113
02:04:44,660 --> 02:04:46,140
Uh, what is that one?

2114
02:04:46,220 --> 02:04:46,500
Nikita?

2115
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:48,560
Were they labeled in the first game too?

2116
02:04:48,760 --> 02:04:49,540
I just never noticed?

2117
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:50,780
Nikita.

2118
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:51,720
Oh, cool.

2119
02:04:52,240 --> 02:04:53,280
How nice of them.

2120
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:58,460
Now I'm pretty sure this one falls.

2121
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:01,060
Yeah!

2122
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:06,820
Run, snake, run!

2123
02:05:07,780 --> 02:05:08,040
Okay.

2124
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:10,460
Run!

2125
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:12,060
Okay.

2126
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:16,760
The place to blow it up is...

2127
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:18,780
Step back a little bit.

2128
02:05:22,250 --> 02:05:22,690
Oh!

2129
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:24,750
Wait, is there just the door?

2130
02:05:28,070 --> 02:05:28,710
Beep, beep.

2131
02:05:29,170 --> 02:05:29,710
What's this one?

2132
02:05:31,090 --> 02:05:31,490
Two.

2133
02:05:32,030 --> 02:05:34,010
Oh wait, I don't know where it is then in this one, right?

2134
02:05:35,250 --> 02:05:35,750
Mm-hmm.

2135
02:05:38,690 --> 02:05:39,690
Oh, there!

2136
02:05:40,110 --> 02:05:41,430
It does look like a different color.

2137
02:05:41,710 --> 02:05:42,050
Just kidding.

2138
02:05:42,570 --> 02:05:43,310
Okay, C4.

2139
02:05:44,050 --> 02:05:44,790
How to use.

2140
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:47,730
Press A button to set.

2141
02:05:47,990 --> 02:05:50,010
B button to detonate.

2142
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:01,050
Easy.

2143
02:06:02,830 --> 02:06:03,810
How do I do the book?

2144
02:06:05,210 --> 02:06:09,850
Adult-oriented material full of girly photos and interesting
columns.

2145
02:06:12,750 --> 02:06:14,750
I'm running around with my book.

2146
02:06:24,310 --> 02:06:26,030
I like the music here.

2147
02:06:29,550 --> 02:06:29,950
Uh...

2148
02:06:30,710 --> 02:06:31,110
Okay.

2149
02:06:32,350 --> 02:06:32,710
Whoa!

2150
02:06:34,330 --> 02:06:35,250
There we go.

2151
02:06:36,330 --> 02:06:37,890
Didn't have time to paint it, eh?

2152
02:06:38,570 --> 02:06:40,070
What were you gonna paint it anyway?

2153
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:42,350
Concrete color?

2154
02:06:43,510 --> 02:06:44,350
How do you...

2155
02:06:44,350 --> 02:06:45,090
How do you paint it?

2156
02:06:47,710 --> 02:06:48,450
Wait, hold on.

2157
02:06:48,550 --> 02:06:49,130
Let me make sure.

2158
02:06:49,270 --> 02:06:49,790
Set to A.

2159
02:06:49,890 --> 02:06:50,570
Okay, A to set.

2160
02:06:52,850 --> 02:06:56,030
Run, run, run, run, run, Run, run, run, run, run, run.

2161
02:07:00,110 --> 02:07:01,350
Concrete gray.

2162
02:07:06,050 --> 02:07:10,190
And then those two.

2163
02:07:13,130 --> 02:07:14,770
A to set.

2164
02:07:15,470 --> 02:07:16,430
This is Ocelot.

2165
02:07:20,660 --> 02:07:23,960
Oh my gosh!

2166
02:07:24,260 --> 02:07:25,500
Oh, he looks...

2167
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:28,280
He looks kind of naked in this position.

2168
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:37,440
He looks a little...

2169
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:38,280
Oh, there we go.

2170
02:07:40,160 --> 02:07:43,400
Wait, why is his jacket like over top his body?

2171
02:07:44,500 --> 02:07:46,240
Were you cold, President Baker?

2172
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:47,360
Were you cold?

2173
02:07:47,780 --> 02:07:57,320
Did they give you a little jacket to help you stay warm?

2174
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:09,140
actually that's even wait his arm sleeves are like they're
flapping everywhere there it's more of a liability because

2175
02:08:09,140 --> 02:08:17,620
it's gonna like what if those what if the breeze oh my god
they're gonna touch the wires it is alaska you're right

2176
02:08:17,620 --> 02:08:26,260
you're right you're right okay um i'm gonna call real quick
we're gonna save.

2177
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:29,100
Okay, Acelot time, baby.

2178
02:08:31,740 --> 02:08:33,340
Snake, you can't use your radar.

2179
02:08:33,560 --> 02:08:34,120
Yeah, I know.

2180
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:35,700
Oh, we're fine.

2181
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:37,400
Don't worry about it.

2182
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:39,220
New file.

2183
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:40,260
Yes.

2184
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:42,180
Bidding!

2185
02:08:42,740 --> 02:08:43,360
Okay, B.

2186
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:45,320
Alright.

2187
02:08:45,640 --> 02:08:46,780
Be careful, Snake.

2188
02:08:47,020 --> 02:08:47,620
Thanks, Mealing.

2189
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:49,760
Wait, I'm gonna go get those grenades.

2190
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:52,340
I don't think I need them right now, but you know what?

2191
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:53,180
I will go get them.

2192
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:56,440
Just a half.

2193
02:09:01,140 --> 02:09:04,300
As Shakespeare said, You can't use the radar.

2194
02:09:05,260 --> 02:09:06,460
What if this is what she meant, though?

2195
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:08,680
As in, like, you can't get everything you want.

2196
02:09:09,500 --> 02:09:13,600
You can't always get what you want.

2197
02:09:14,580 --> 02:09:15,600
Okay, those were fine.

2198
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:20,080
And it was this one, too, right?

2199
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:22,760
I'm so calm.

2200
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:26,940
And I think we're safe.

2201
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:28,020
I think we're safe.

2202
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:31,860
I'm so scared.

2203
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:37,500
Lots of so-called bullets.

2204
02:09:38,660 --> 02:09:39,140
Very good.

2205
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:39,760
Okay, cool.

2206
02:09:40,380 --> 02:09:40,580
Perfect.

2207
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:46,100
The first person makes it easier compared to the original.

2208
02:09:46,340 --> 02:09:47,020
Oh, yeah.

2209
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:48,020
It really does.

2210
02:09:50,300 --> 02:09:54,260
I think it's just for me the controller is the more
difficult thing.

2211
02:09:54,580 --> 02:09:56,300
Well, actually...

2212
02:09:57,140 --> 02:10:07,540
Um, the easiest way that I've played the game, well, well,
Metal Gear Solid 1, I've done my best, like, my best

2213
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:13,880
performance, quote-unquote performance, playing the Switch
version, which is absolutely wild, I think.

2214
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:17,200
Um, but, I don't know.

2215
02:10:17,780 --> 02:10:21,380
I don't know why it was so easy for me on a TDR mat.

2216
02:10:24,380 --> 02:10:25,560
You'll get used to it.

2217
02:10:25,620 --> 02:10:27,400
Yeah, yeah, I will, uh...

2218
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:29,620
I will practice with it some more and stuff.

2219
02:10:29,720 --> 02:10:35,420
I gotta get used to, like, the first person being here and
then...

2220
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:39,220
Okay, we don't need to crouch in this, so...

2221
02:10:39,220 --> 02:10:41,060
And we don't need to kick fight.

2222
02:10:41,300 --> 02:10:42,420
We just gotta...

2223
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:43,880
We just gotta shoot.

2224
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:47,300
Hopefully we can actually shoot him in the head, though.

2225
02:10:49,600 --> 02:10:51,380
Oh, my God.

2226
02:10:51,960 --> 02:10:53,140
Your sleeves, be careful!

2227
02:10:54,240 --> 02:10:54,420
Oh!

2228
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:57,120

Keep going.

2236
02:12:16,220 --> 02:12:16,580
Yes!

2237
02:12:17,680 --> 02:12:18,760
Dramatic pause.

2238
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:20,240
Yes!

2239
02:12:21,220 --> 02:12:22,280
Oh my god, okay.

Yes, don't stop.

2242
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:26,000
Oh, Salon.

2243

Yes!

2244

Oh, yes, keep it up.

02:12:34,440 --> 02:12:36,520
Oh my god, he's so awesome.

2246
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:39,720
I've been waiting for you, Solid Snake.

2247
02:12:39,740 --> 02:12:41,980
Oh, I bet you have.

2248
02:12:42,900 --> 02:12:45,900
We'll see if the man can live up to the legend.

2249
02:12:57,420 --> 02:12:58,120
Shadashaskan.

2250
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:06,420
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

2251
02:13:06,420 --> 02:13:08,900
This is the greatest handgun ever made.

2252
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:11,700
The cult single action army.

2253
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:16,730
Six bullets.

2254
02:13:18,420 --> 02:13:21,740

Oh, hold on.

2261

2262

Let me draw.

2263
02:14:03,900 --> 02:14:04,520
Where are you?

2264
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:05,240
Where are you anyway?

2265
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:06,160
Oh.

2266
02:14:10,220 --> 02:14:10,240
Oh.

2267
02:14:10,280 --> 02:14:10,840
Hello?

2268
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:12,080
Oh.

2269
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:17,620
He's reloading.

2270
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:18,500
I'm alive.

2271
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:20,840
No.

2272
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:21,620
No.

2273
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:22,320
No.

2274
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:22,740
Ocelot.

2275
02:14:22,900 --> 02:14:23,500
This is too easy.

2276
02:14:28,760 --> 02:14:29,280
No

2277
02:14:32,950 --> 02:14:33,470
way!

2278
02:14:36,550 --> 02:14:37,830
You're pretty good.

2279
02:14:38,670 --> 02:14:42,190
Just what I'd expect from the man with the same code as the
boss.

2280
02:14:43,010 --> 02:14:46,070
It's been a long time since I had such a good fight.

2281
02:14:46,070 --> 02:14:47,130
That was a good fight.

2282
02:14:47,290 --> 02:14:47,690
You're so right.

2283
02:14:48,170 --> 02:14:49,250
Just getting warmed up.

2284
02:14:51,670 --> 02:14:52,170
Ah!

2285
02:14:53,570 --> 02:14:56,870
This is, that is actually one of the bigger criticisms.

2286
02:14:58,010 --> 02:15:03,090
of this game is that the boss fights tend to be too easy
because watch

2287
02:15:14,710 --> 02:15:28,470
poor president Baker is just like oh god that's a cool shot

2288
02:15:32,550 --> 02:15:35,970
Speed running the fight with Ocelot for real.

2289
02:15:39,790 --> 02:15:43,710
This one is really easy to cheese and um, what's his name?

2290
02:15:44,850 --> 02:15:48,170
Uh, Vulcan Raven is very easy to cheese.

2291
02:15:48,950 --> 02:15:49,530
Allegedly.

2292
02:15:55,070 --> 02:15:56,190
You're that ninja!

2293
02:15:58,190 --> 02:16:00,250
Can't you even die right?

2294
02:16:03,030 --> 02:16:07,330
After standing mostly still and getting shot seven times,
you're pretty good.

2295
02:16:07,330 --> 02:16:07,810
You were lucky.

2296
02:16:08,690 --> 02:16:09,810
We'll meet again.

2297
02:16:11,430 --> 02:16:12,650
You know what I just realized?

2298
02:16:12,910 --> 02:16:14,810
Snake's got those Kimpossible lips.

2299
02:16:15,570 --> 02:16:16,710
Do you see it?

2300
02:16:19,170 --> 02:16:21,050
I want to hear what he sounds like.

2301
02:16:27,070 --> 02:16:27,990
I like you.

2302
02:16:28,510 --> 02:16:29,910
I have no name.

2303
02:16:30,110 --> 02:16:31,410
Oh, he sounds so cool though.

2304
02:16:32,010 --> 02:16:37,290
I mean, it's... I get that, like it's sad that I'm glad it's
not Greg Eagles, but...

2305
02:16:38,130 --> 02:16:39,410
What the voice...

2306
02:16:39,410 --> 02:16:40,070
What the...

2307
02:16:41,110 --> 02:16:41,950
What's it called?

2308
02:16:42,130 --> 02:16:43,990
The voice effect over top.

2309
02:16:48,870 --> 02:16:52,310
Wait, what did it say?

2310
02:16:54,850 --> 02:16:55,790
What was it saying?

2311
02:16:56,850 --> 02:16:57,250
Whoa.

2312
02:17:00,490 --> 02:17:01,750
Sounds like a ride.

2313
02:17:02,350 --> 02:17:03,090
Do you think so?

2314
02:17:03,510 --> 02:17:04,130
Oh, no!

2315
02:17:04,570 --> 02:17:07,150
Oh my god, he's going crazy.

2316
02:17:08,210 --> 02:17:11,170
Oh, oh, the fight with him is probably going to be so...

2317
02:17:11,170 --> 02:17:11,690
Wow!

2318
02:17:16,690 --> 02:17:17,250
Wow!

2319
02:17:18,610 --> 02:17:20,010
Slow motion bullets!

2320
02:17:25,970 --> 02:17:26,530
What?

2321
02:17:26,970 --> 02:17:28,070
What was that implying?

2322
02:17:28,970 --> 02:17:30,510
Oh, he was cutting the top!

2323
02:17:31,610 --> 02:17:35,190
Oh, he cut the top of the building just to kick it at Snake!

2324
02:17:35,590 --> 02:17:36,530
No way!

2325
02:17:51,110 --> 02:17:52,230
The tension.

2326
02:17:57,070 --> 02:17:57,350
Bye!

2327
02:17:58,870 --> 02:18:03,230
Oh, oh, it's a little messy, but okay.

2328
02:18:03,550 --> 02:18:04,190
Who the hell?

2329
02:18:05,470 --> 02:18:09,370
It's like if I'm controlling him, how do they make my man
even more Chuni?

2330
02:18:10,090 --> 02:18:13,050
Because the man describing these events is absolute.

2331
02:18:13,310 --> 02:18:14,150
Otaku freak!

2332
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:19,280
Can you talk?

2333
02:18:20,380 --> 02:18:21,080
Who are you?

2334
02:18:22,040 --> 02:18:24,220
I'm not one of them.

2335
02:18:30,720 --> 02:18:32,400
I like this part too.

2336
02:18:32,860 --> 02:18:35,420
The way Snake reacts in this part makes me laugh.

2337
02:18:35,620 --> 02:18:36,020
What about yours?

2338
02:18:37,220 --> 02:18:39,020
Oh, I get it.

2339
02:18:39,560 --> 02:18:40,620
Jim sent you.

2340
02:18:40,760 --> 02:18:41,540
Oh, Jim.

2341
02:18:42,680 --> 02:18:43,540
Oh, Jim.

2342
02:18:44,180 --> 02:18:44,880
Answer my question.

2343
02:18:46,120 --> 02:18:47,200
What about your code?

2344
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:48,440
There's no time.

2345
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:51,120
I talked.

2346
02:18:51,340 --> 02:18:52,540
Oh, you weak.

2347
02:18:52,640 --> 02:18:55,780
Now the terrorists have both codes and can launch any time.

2348
02:18:55,820 --> 02:18:56,920
These cutscenes are crazy.

2349
02:18:56,960 --> 02:18:58,640
It's not like I didn't fight.

2350
02:18:58,840 --> 02:18:59,220
It is.

2351
02:18:59,560 --> 02:19:02,240
I managed to resist Psycho Mantis' mind probe.

2352
02:19:02,720 --> 02:19:03,620
He couldn't read you.

2353
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:05,000
How'd you do it?

2354
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:08,640
Surgical implants in my brain.

2355
02:19:09,020 --> 02:19:09,060
Oh.

2356
02:19:09,980 --> 02:19:11,020
Surgical implants.

2357
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:12,240
Surgical implants.

2358
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:14,280
Kind of like psychic insulation.

2359
02:19:15,060 --> 02:19:17,740
Everyone who knows these top secret codes has it.

2360
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:18,600
Wow.

2361
02:19:18,620 --> 02:19:19,600
Even the DARPA chief?

2362
02:19:20,560 --> 02:19:21,160
Of course.

2363
02:19:21,960 --> 02:19:22,240
Done.

2364
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:25,500
The chief said Mantis got his code by reading his mind.

2365
02:19:26,300 --> 02:19:28,240
Are you sure you heard him right?

2366
02:19:28,480 --> 02:19:28,940
Hmm.

2367
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:30,660
Yeah.

2368
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:33,920
Anyway, how did they get your code?

2369
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:35,320
Yeah, why'd you talk, buddy?

2370
02:19:35,780 --> 02:19:40,040
I never had any training on how to resist torture.

2371
02:19:43,140 --> 02:19:43,660
Yeah.

2372
02:19:43,960 --> 02:19:46,760
It looks like you had some fun with you, all right.

2373
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:50,340
It's just a little torture.

2374
02:19:50,540 --> 02:19:51,300
He's not human.

2375
02:19:52,640 --> 02:20:04,580
loved every second of it he's such a freak he broke it oh
looks like you're more than even now his was sliced off the

2376
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:22,000
effects you're a funny guy so he is the DARPA chief is he
okay dead dead what it can't be he's a little quirky yeah

2377
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,040
that's not Would you promise, Jim?

2378
02:20:24,720 --> 02:20:26,540
Now you want to shut me out?

2379
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:28,880
Calm down.

2380
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:31,060
Come, be done.

2381
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:33,800
What's wrong with you?

2382
02:20:34,120 --> 02:20:35,960
I just told you I was here to save you.

2383
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:41,380
I didn't kill the DARPA chief.

2384
02:20:41,840 --> 02:20:43,400
He had a heart attack or something.

2385
02:20:44,900 --> 02:20:45,820
A heart attack?

2386
02:20:46,320 --> 02:20:47,680
Oh, don't be a fool.

2387
02:20:51,240 --> 02:20:52,280
Lucky Baker.

2388
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:54,520
Paris have both codes now.

2389
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,780
Oh, those boys are totally insane.

2390
02:21:00,580 --> 02:21:02,520
They wouldn't hesitate to launch.

2391
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:04,460
I agree.

2392
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:06,360
But what do they really want?

2393
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:07,800
What do they really want?

2394
02:21:08,420 --> 02:21:09,360
Who knows?

2395
02:21:10,440 --> 02:21:12,000
Maybe they're like us in the arms industry.

2396
02:21:12,020 --> 02:21:12,800
Thank you so much.

2397
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:15,900
Always looking forward to the next good war.

2398
02:21:17,100 --> 02:21:20,860
Well, I'm not going to let these maniacs start a war today.

2399
02:21:21,060 --> 02:21:21,880
Not today.

2400
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:33,400
have the card keys card keys give me a card key to override
the detonation code I heard you had them no definitely not a

2401
02:21:33,400 --> 02:21:44,760
god-bad what who does then not the terrorists no that that
that woman woman who the one with the nice soldier that was

2402
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:55,400
thrown in prison along with me prison that female soldier
hmm she said that She had just joined up as a new recruit.

2403
02:21:55,860 --> 02:21:58,120
This girl is a thorn in my side.

2404
02:21:58,480 --> 02:22:00,540
Because she refused to take part in the rebellion.

2405
02:22:02,220 --> 02:22:03,000
A new recruit.

2406
02:22:03,960 --> 02:22:05,320
Could that be the colonel's niece?

2407
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:08,000
I gave her the key.

2408
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:11,600
Looks like she managed to break out of here, though.

2409
02:22:12,400 --> 02:22:13,560
I hope she's okay.

2410
02:22:14,520 --> 02:22:16,460
I gotta go to the bathroom after this part.

2411
02:22:16,660 --> 02:22:18,540
She's green, but as tough as they come.

2412
02:22:19,260 --> 02:22:20,620
But how did you know she escaped?

2413
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:28,260
contact with her by codec oh this part this is the part that
i like tied up here that is because in the original it's

2414
02:22:28,260 --> 02:22:36,140
like the goblet of fire part we're in the book dumbledore
reacts so calmly but in the movie he's crazy if she still

2415
02:22:36,140 --> 02:22:46,310
has it you should be able to contact her in the original he
acts like sure she has it this one he acts so crazy oh yeah

2416
02:22:46,310 --> 02:22:49,190
give her code let me tell you it's he's

2417
02:22:54,010 --> 02:22:54,590
Huh?

2418
02:22:56,430 --> 02:23:01,030
Oh Sorry, I forgot Damn

2419
02:23:05,290 --> 02:23:16,750
Oh, that's right It should be on the back of the package Try
to contact her I'll contact her right away.

2420
02:23:16,950 --> 02:23:22,530
In the original he's just like damn and like kind of like
hits his knee To prevent the missile launch and this one he

2421
02:23:22,530 --> 02:23:28,370
acts like an actual lunatic You need to find Howe Emmerich,
one of my employees.

2422
02:23:29,810 --> 02:23:30,830
Howe Emmerich?

2423
02:23:31,350 --> 02:23:34,650
The team leader of the Metal Gear Rex project.

2424
02:23:35,450 --> 02:23:38,150
A genius in engineering, but a little bit of an oddball.

2425
02:23:38,210 --> 02:23:39,630
A little bit of an oddball, you guys.

2426
02:23:39,670 --> 02:23:43,570
If there's anyone who can figure out how to stop Metal Gear
from launching, it's him.

2427
02:23:44,450 --> 02:23:46,250
What if he can't come up with anything?

2428
02:23:46,950 --> 02:23:48,290
Well, you'll have to destroy it.

2429
02:23:49,130 --> 02:23:51,070
Emmerich knows how to destroy Metal Gear.

2430
02:23:51,350 --> 02:23:52,630
Where is this Emmerich?

2431
02:23:52,630 --> 02:24:01,990
well he's probably being held somewhere in the nuclear
warhead storage building it's it's north from here that's

2432
02:24:01,990 --> 02:24:11,650
where he worked got it I understand but why metal gear the
nuclear age ended with the turn of the Millennium oh you're

2433
02:24:11,650 --> 02:24:22,730
wrong the nuclear threat hasn't disappeared the threat is
more real than ever before it's so icky the amount of spent

2434
02:24:22,730 --> 02:24:35,270
nuclear fuel and plutonium is increasing even today real
footage oh you're pretty good thank you drums and drums of

2435
02:24:35,270 --> 02:24:45,290
nuclear waste stack this high as far as you can see because
there's still no real way to use it or dispose of it so they

2436
02:24:45,290 --> 02:24:53,510
just close the lid and try to it'll go away essentially yes
wow and they're not even doing a good job of storing it no

2437
02:24:53,510 --> 02:25:02,350
oh there's just people right there with nuclear waste
seeping out of them unbelievable unbelievable several pounds

2438
02:25:02,350 --> 02:25:10,310
of muff were reported every year not the muff it stands for
material unaccounted for it proves that there's a large and

2439
02:25:10,310 --> 02:25:19,770
well-organized black market in nuclear materials furthermore
since the end of the Cold War, Russian nuclear engineers in

2440
02:25:19,770 --> 02:25:22,910
particular are out of work with nowhere to turn.

2441
02:25:23,050 --> 02:25:25,910
Hey, I beat him that quickly because I'm good at the game.

2442
02:25:26,250 --> 02:25:30,130
There's plenty of available nuclear material and scientists
for making a bomb.

2443
02:25:31,310 --> 02:25:36,210
We live in an age where any small country can have a nuclear
weapons program.

2444
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:38,630
What about the other superpowers?

2445
02:25:39,770 --> 02:25:43,270
The Russians and Chinese still pursue a policy of
deterrence.

2446
02:25:43,750 --> 02:25:44,070
Deterrence.

2447
02:25:44,550 --> 02:25:45,230
Do you see?

2448
02:25:46,250 --> 02:25:49,370
The complete nuclear disarmament is an impossibility.

2449
02:25:49,530 --> 02:25:50,530
Oh, deterrence.

2450
02:25:50,810 --> 02:25:53,110
To maintain our own policy of deterrence.

2451
02:25:54,030 --> 02:25:56,370
We need a weapon of overwhelming power.

2452
02:25:58,630 --> 02:26:00,350
The Peace Walker flashbacks.

2453
02:26:00,530 --> 02:26:01,210
You need metal gear.

2454
02:26:01,890 --> 02:26:03,050
Oh my god, Rex is so cute.

2455
02:26:03,070 --> 02:26:09,850
You know our industry suffered quite a blow as a result of
the cuts in military budgets due to this so-called peace.

2456
02:26:10,510 --> 02:26:12,890
I remember hearing a lot about mergers and takeovers.

2457
02:26:12,890 --> 02:26:14,810
Oh, I missed the Ocelot boss fight.

2458
02:26:16,250 --> 02:26:17,490
It lasted like 15 seconds.

2459
02:26:17,510 --> 02:26:19,230
I lost their bid to produce the U.S.

2460
02:26:19,330 --> 02:26:21,210
Air Forces next lie in a fighter jet.

2461
02:26:22,030 --> 02:26:25,390
The Metal Gear system was our last ace in the hole.

2462
02:26:26,030 --> 02:26:29,730
That's why we pushed to have Metal Gear developed as a black
project.

2463
02:26:30,470 --> 02:26:31,250
Black project.

2464
02:26:31,330 --> 02:26:31,990
Black project.

2465
02:26:32,230 --> 02:26:33,970
Secret projects paid for by the Pentagon's black budget.

2466
02:26:33,990 --> 02:26:36,050
Yeah, that's what the DARPA chief talked about earlier.

2467
02:26:36,370 --> 02:26:41,010
You can avoid a lot of red tape and get a great lead time on
your weapons production.

2468
02:26:41,710 --> 02:26:44,490
You avoid the red tape because you use black instead.

2469
02:26:46,290 --> 02:26:47,670
It's a common secret.

2470
02:26:48,490 --> 02:26:50,030
It's a well-known secret.

2471
02:26:53,190 --> 02:26:53,710
Bribes.

2472
02:26:54,450 --> 02:26:54,970
Bribes.

2473
02:26:55,230 --> 02:26:58,270
Just call it the military-industrial complex.

2474
02:26:59,550 --> 02:27:02,210
Anyway, Metal Gear was going to be formally adopted.

2475
02:27:02,450 --> 02:27:05,650
After the results of this exercise were analyzed.

2476
02:27:06,770 --> 02:27:09,010
I don't give a crap about you or your company.

2477
02:27:10,070 --> 02:27:10,410
Yeah.

2478
02:27:10,770 --> 02:27:13,010
Yes, that's about what I'd expect from a grunt like you.

2479
02:27:13,230 --> 02:27:14,630
Like Victoria's secret?

2480
02:27:16,250 --> 02:27:27,150
you came for right oh thanks finally what's that an optical
disc it's all here don't give me your hard drive was

2481
02:27:27,150 --> 02:27:35,010
destroyed by gunfire this is the only remaining copy of the
data what kind of data all the data collected from this

2482
02:27:35,010 --> 02:27:45,350

up all security level two doors between the cheeks

2485

2486
02:28:17,870 --> 02:28:21,190

2487
02:28:21,550 --> 02:28:22,490
Do you have IBS?

2488
02:28:22,490 --> 02:28:23,570
Who or what was that ninja thing?

2489
02:28:24,230 --> 02:28:25,550
It looked like you knew something.

2490
02:28:26,330 --> 02:28:26,730
Did it?

2491
02:28:27,310 --> 02:28:28,510
That ninja?

2492
02:28:29,710 --> 02:28:32,410
That was Foxhound's dark little secret.

2493
02:28:33,610 --> 02:28:34,650
Dark little secret?

2494
02:28:34,890 --> 02:28:37,870
I'll keep you my dark little secret.

2495
02:28:38,430 --> 02:28:39,030
Soldier.

2496
02:28:39,650 --> 02:28:42,410
Don't tell anyone or you'll be.

2497
02:28:42,890 --> 02:28:43,650
You know him?

2498
02:28:47,370 --> 02:28:49,610
You should ask Dr. Naohy.

2499
02:28:49,630 --> 02:29:01,350
hunter from Foxhound she knows better than I Naomi you've
got to stop them if it goes public my just my company and I

2500
02:29:01,350 --> 02:29:18,610
are finished what doesn't metal gear use currently existing
technology metal gear itself does but oh he's turning greed

2501
02:29:18,610 --> 02:29:23,970
what did Oh my god, he ate the blueberry from Willy Wonka!

2502
02:29:24,210 --> 02:29:24,990
Oh!

2503
02:29:26,870 --> 02:29:29,070
He's turning into... What's a grape?

2504
02:29:29,890 --> 02:29:31,370
Why is he so green?

2505
02:29:35,610 --> 02:29:37,390
He's hulking out.

2506
02:29:37,410 --> 02:29:39,650
He went and did it.

2507
02:29:42,490 --> 02:29:43,150
Oh.

2508
02:29:43,390 --> 02:29:44,550
What are you talking about?

2509
02:29:44,630 --> 02:29:46,190
What are you talking about?

2510
02:29:49,630 --> 02:29:50,390
Use it!

2511
02:29:51,890 --> 02:29:52,030
Four!

2512
02:29:56,270 --> 02:29:57,210
That's it?

2513
02:29:57,850 --> 02:29:58,010
Oh.

2514
02:29:59,730 --> 02:29:59,910
Oh.

2515
02:30:02,010 --> 02:30:03,310
What the hell?

2516
02:30:03,850 --> 02:30:08,090
That one was way less dramatic than, uh, the DARPA chiefs.

2517
02:30:08,310 --> 02:30:10,750
The DARPA chief was crawling all over us.

2518
02:30:15,330 --> 02:30:16,010
Um...

2519
02:30:18,290 --> 02:30:20,050
Colonel, are you listening?

2520
02:30:20,410 --> 02:30:21,230
Now he's dead.

2521
02:30:21,290 --> 02:30:22,410
Yeah, Colonel.

2522
02:30:22,830 --> 02:30:23,550
I have no idea.

2523
02:30:23,990 --> 02:30:25,170
Don't lie to me.

2524
02:30:25,630 --> 02:30:27,430
I have no idea.

2525
02:30:28,670 --> 02:30:32,110
Well, there are lots of drugs that can cause a heart attack
in large doses.

2526
02:30:32,850 --> 02:30:34,890
I have no idea, Snake.

2527
02:30:36,090 --> 02:30:38,330
But we won't be able to tell without doing an autopsy.

2528
02:30:39,430 --> 02:30:42,470
Snake, I want you and Merrill to work together.

2529
02:30:43,190 --> 02:30:44,250
Can I trust her?

2530
02:30:44,910 --> 02:30:46,370
More than you can trust me.

2531
02:30:47,930 --> 02:30:49,530
Get in contact with her.

2532
02:30:51,290 --> 02:30:57,990
electrical interference coming from there it should be okay
if you do burst transmission like us but normal transmission

2533
02:30:57,990 --> 02:31:06,270
is probably impossible try moving away from that area okay
snake get a hold of yourself Naomi what the hell is the

2534
02:31:06,270 --> 02:31:13,850
better all-american reject song you could tell because it
was like no is that the one that are you sure yes we have no

2535
02:31:13,850 --> 02:31:24,810
one like that in our unit is that the song snake I'm
counting on you I'm counting on you all right we need to get

2536
02:31:24,810 --> 02:31:34,270

real quick such as a mailing let's save i gotta go to the

2537
02:31:34,270 --> 02:31:47,910

2539
02:31:56,530 --> 02:31:58,070
Be careful, Snake.

2540
02:31:58,430 --> 02:32:00,930
Come on, Maling, tell me, tell me one of your stories!

2541
02:32:02,030 --> 02:32:03,150
Call Campbell too.

2542
02:32:03,810 --> 02:32:06,270
The DARPA chief and President Baker.

2543
02:32:07,270 --> 02:32:10,090
So now the terrorists know both detonation codes.

2544
02:32:10,210 --> 02:32:10,930
This sucks.

2545
02:32:11,230 --> 02:32:14,290
Yeah, and on top of that, they both died right in front of
my eyes.

2546
02:32:15,750 --> 02:32:18,270
Oh, please!

2547
02:32:18,650 --> 02:32:20,290
I guess...

2548
02:32:21,290 --> 02:32:22,290
I didn't have to start this up.

2549
02:32:22,310 --> 02:32:23,110
I guess I could have gone to the bathroom.

2550
02:32:23,370 --> 02:32:24,270
I gotta go to the bathroom.

2551
02:32:24,690 --> 02:32:24,970
Okay.

2552
02:32:26,150 --> 02:32:26,510
Or...

2553
02:32:26,510 --> 02:32:26,590
Or...

2554
02:32:26,590 --> 02:32:29,370
Find the Metal Gear Chief Engineer that President Baker
mentioned.

2555
02:32:30,410 --> 02:32:31,130
Hal Emmerich.

2556
02:32:32,490 --> 02:32:32,510
Ugh.

2557
02:32:33,310 --> 02:32:36,150
In any case, you should contact Merrill by Kodak.

2558
02:32:37,050 --> 02:32:39,370
Wasn't her frequency written on the back of the package?

2559
02:32:39,670 --> 02:32:40,030
Yes.

2560
02:32:40,390 --> 02:32:40,850
Oh, thank you.

2561
02:32:40,990 --> 02:32:42,170
Okay, I'll be right back.

2562
02:32:42,270 --> 02:32:42,830
I'll be right back.

2563
02:32:42,910 --> 02:32:43,410
I'll be right back.

the box everybody so let's pull that up so we can get

2585
02:35:31,050 --> 02:35:32,810
merrill's codec

2586
02:35:36,490 --> 02:35:46,270

Do we have clearance too now?

2591
02:36:14,710 --> 02:36:15,470
I don't remember.

2592
02:36:15,870 --> 02:36:16,670
Oh, yes, we do.

2593
02:36:16,830 --> 02:36:17,950

Grab that.

2595

2596
02:36:21,090 --> 02:36:21,890
Oh, never mind.

2597
02:36:22,350 --> 02:36:23,810
We didn't even use that many bullets.

2598
02:36:26,770 --> 02:36:27,390
Ah, ah.

2599
02:36:27,450 --> 02:36:28,450
Wait, what is this place?

2600
02:36:31,710 --> 02:36:32,790
What is this place?

2601
02:36:36,050 --> 02:36:36,990
Oh, the armory.

2602
02:36:37,230 --> 02:36:38,130
Oh, this is the...

Oh, now the people are here okay um but we gotta go oh well

02:37:05,770 --> 02:37:16,110
in here yet i don't think um okay let's go I'm just going to

2607
02:37:32,470 --> 02:37:46,690
warheads building for our little buddy yes, even in the
original That door wasn't available in the OG game with your

2608
02:37:46,690 --> 02:37:47,470
card key at the time.

2609
02:37:48,110 --> 02:37:49,490
Oh, okay.

2610
02:37:49,630 --> 02:37:50,630
That's probably why.

2611
02:37:51,070 --> 02:37:52,350
It's originally like level six.

2612
02:37:52,890 --> 02:37:54,750
Oh, that's so interesting.

2613
02:37:56,310 --> 02:37:57,190
All right, don't be a baby.

2614
02:37:58,750 --> 02:38:00,130
I'm a little scared, though.

2615
02:38:01,270 --> 02:38:02,250
Because what if they see me?

2616
02:38:18,470 --> 02:38:20,130
Uh, where is the trap?

2617
02:38:20,170 --> 02:38:21,510
Oh, the trap is already activated.

2618
02:38:21,670 --> 02:38:21,890
Nice.

2619
02:38:22,510 --> 02:38:22,850
Okay.

2620
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:32,340
Uh, uh, uh, there.

2621
02:38:38,370 --> 02:38:39,830
Come on, please, Snake, turn around!

2622
02:38:40,710 --> 02:38:41,330
Press the button!

2623
02:38:43,430 --> 02:38:44,670
Drop him in the hole!

2624
02:38:45,590 --> 02:38:46,710
That's so rude!

2625
02:38:47,090 --> 02:38:51,470
I don't, uh, I don't remember if there's any level twos in
here, but we got, we'll come back anyway, so...

2626
02:38:52,310 --> 02:38:53,550
Doesn't really matter, I think.

2627
02:38:53,910 --> 02:38:55,470
Uh, well, press...

2628
02:38:57,850 --> 02:38:58,290
Uh...

2629
02:38:58,290 --> 02:38:58,870
One.

2630
02:38:59,570 --> 02:39:00,370
Oh, that was close.

2631
02:39:00,750 --> 02:39:02,370
He was coming right up by us.

2632
02:39:04,630 --> 02:39:05,310
Famous!

2633
02:39:06,190 --> 02:39:07,230
It's okay, we'll come back.

2634
02:39:08,450 --> 02:39:09,750
Famous is level two.

2635
02:39:18,370 --> 02:39:19,450
Why is it like...

2636
02:39:20,610 --> 02:39:21,030
Oh!

2637
02:39:22,030 --> 02:39:22,370
Oh!

2638
02:39:23,090 --> 02:39:24,490
That was so close.

2639
02:39:25,010 --> 02:39:25,990
You little jerk.

2640
02:39:29,720 --> 02:39:31,820
I saw him back there.

2641
02:39:32,640 --> 02:39:33,060
Hmm.

2642
02:39:37,190 --> 02:39:38,310
Where are you?

2643
02:39:38,350 --> 02:39:39,070
Oh, hello.

2644
02:39:39,810 --> 02:39:40,130
Hello.

2645
02:39:42,810 --> 02:39:44,010
That's one down.

2646
02:39:45,230 --> 02:39:45,370
Hmm.

2647
02:39:45,390 --> 02:40:06,640

uh thank you soup um the music in this part is so lame oh

2648
02:40:06,640 --> 02:40:17,620
dang it it's so not good as the original they get rid of the
chorus and it's just so oh hello to you hello hello Hello!

2649
02:40:22,990 --> 02:40:24,810
It's just not as nice.

2650
02:40:25,590 --> 02:40:26,970
Where the heck is this other guy?

2651
02:40:29,190 --> 02:40:31,550
Not the status reports!

2652
02:40:32,350 --> 02:40:33,230
You're killing me!

2653
02:40:34,590 --> 02:40:36,090
Oh gosh, no.

2654
02:40:37,030 --> 02:40:37,850
Please, no.

2655
02:40:42,630 --> 02:40:44,830
No, they don't, we don't need the backup unit!

2656
02:40:46,770 --> 02:40:47,970
Oh, is there a...

2657
02:40:47,970 --> 02:40:48,170
No.

2658
02:40:50,670 --> 02:40:51,510
Yes!

2659
02:40:55,470 --> 02:40:55,890
Ugh!

2660
02:40:56,690 --> 02:40:57,630
It feels so good.

2661
02:40:59,370 --> 02:41:00,150
Status report.

2662
02:41:00,490 --> 02:41:02,810
It's the bane of my existence, for real.

2663
02:41:04,230 --> 02:41:08,010
The status report will actually kill me, I think.

2664
02:41:15,300 --> 02:41:16,940
Just imagining things.

2665
02:41:17,200 --> 02:41:18,560
Just imagining things.

2666
02:41:19,860 --> 02:41:21,400
Just imagining.

2667
02:41:22,160 --> 02:41:22,340
Oh.

2668
02:41:24,400 --> 02:41:25,720
They're not gonna come up here, are they?

2669
02:41:26,340 --> 02:41:28,920
Oh shoot, they're right here!

2670
02:41:29,280 --> 02:41:29,440
Ah!

2671
02:41:30,920 --> 02:41:31,820
Um, hold on.

2672
02:41:34,480 --> 02:41:34,880
Um...

2673
02:41:38,080 --> 02:41:38,480
Hmm...

2674
02:41:38,480 --> 02:41:40,160
I didn't realize they were on the second floor.

2675
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:44,400
Hmm...

2676
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:45,520
How do I want to handle this?

2677
02:41:48,960 --> 02:41:50,040
How do we want to

2678
02:41:54,090 --> 02:41:54,570
handle this?

2679
02:41:57,670 --> 02:41:58,730
I thought they were down below.

2680
02:41:58,910 --> 02:41:59,490
I didn't know they were

2681
02:42:04,130 --> 02:42:04,270
up.

2682
02:42:04,750 --> 02:42:06,150
You didn't see them on your radar?

2683
02:42:06,550 --> 02:42:08,130
No, they weren't on the radar.

2684
02:42:09,670 --> 02:42:09,790
Can

2685
02:42:22,190 --> 02:42:22,710
I get up, please?

2686
02:42:22,970 --> 02:42:24,670
Also, can we attach my rations?

2687
02:42:24,990 --> 02:42:25,230
Thank you.

2688
02:42:25,770 --> 02:42:26,850
And, uh...

2689
02:42:26,850 --> 02:42:27,010
Oh.

2690
02:42:28,590 --> 02:42:29,030
Uh.

2691
02:42:29,810 --> 02:42:30,570
Oh, please.

2692
02:42:30,730 --> 02:42:31,030
Please.

2693
02:42:31,570 --> 02:42:31,570
Please.

2694
02:42:32,090 --> 02:42:32,090
Please.

2695
02:42:32,310 --> 02:42:32,590
Please.

2696
02:42:33,150 --> 02:42:33,590
Game!

2697
02:42:35,130 --> 02:42:36,530
You piece of shit!

2698
02:42:36,950 --> 02:42:37,430
Shut up!

2699
02:42:39,490 --> 02:42:40,270
Oh, oh.

2700
02:42:41,550 --> 02:42:43,410
And, uh, I'm bleeding out.

2701
02:42:43,890 --> 02:42:44,690

clear no stop no no

2706
02:43:41,720 --> 02:43:43,140
Don't keep going.

2707
02:43:58,450 --> 02:44:00,210
Get up, Stag!

2708
02:44:01,950 --> 02:44:02,950
Oh wait.

2709
02:44:11,020 --> 02:44:12,320
My cardboard box!

2710
02:44:12,540 --> 02:44:12,900
How could you?

2711
02:44:15,020 --> 02:44:15,920
How could you?

2712
02:44:18,320 --> 02:44:19,500
Ah, la la la.

2713
02:44:26,870 --> 02:44:28,450
Do you think I can get him?

2714
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:35,040
There we go.

2715
02:44:43,160 --> 02:44:45,240
Stop, please stop coming!

2716
02:44:51,770 --> 02:44:52,850
Why are you homing?

2717
02:44:53,210 --> 02:44:53,510
At who?

2718
02:44:53,750 --> 02:44:54,050
At what?

2719
02:44:54,690 --> 02:44:55,510
Who are you homing at?

2720
02:44:56,050 --> 02:44:56,550
Hmm?

2721
02:44:57,150 --> 02:44:57,550
Clear!

2722
02:44:58,030 --> 02:44:58,690
Get out of here.

2723
02:45:05,300 --> 02:45:07,280
I think I just...

2724
02:45:07,280 --> 02:45:10,080
Um, maybe ruin my chances of getting away with that.

2725
02:45:17,470 --> 02:45:18,130
All good!

2726
02:45:20,770 --> 02:45:22,450
Return to your positions, everybody.

2727
02:45:31,310 --> 02:45:33,610
Return to your positions, everybody.

2728
02:45:35,750 --> 02:45:36,590
Return to your positions.

2729
02:45:37,930 --> 02:45:42,670
If I knock this guy out, though, they're just going to cause
another status report issue thing, isn't it?

2730
02:45:43,430 --> 02:45:43,850
Stop

2731
02:45:47,720 --> 02:45:48,240
moving.

2732
02:45:48,520 --> 02:45:51,720
Actually, can you not make some noise?

2733
02:45:51,980 --> 02:45:53,500
Can you, like...

2734
02:45:53,500 --> 02:45:56,600
Are they

2735
02:46:13,810 --> 02:46:14,350
coming up?

2736
02:46:16,950 --> 02:46:17,650
Can't tell.

2737
02:46:20,920 --> 02:46:21,920
Are they going to come up?

2738
02:46:24,020 --> 02:46:24,580
Hmm.

2739
02:46:31,350 --> 02:46:32,710
I'm actually not sure.

2740
02:46:35,150 --> 02:46:36,370
I don't think so.

2741
02:46:36,610 --> 02:46:37,030
Lockers?

2742
02:46:38,650 --> 02:46:39,170
Oh, you're right.

2743
02:46:40,510 --> 02:46:41,650
Actually, that might be even better.

2744
02:46:44,530 --> 02:46:44,630
Oh.

2745
02:46:46,270 --> 02:46:53,170
I don't see anyone on the radar, so maybe it's okay.

2746
02:46:53,370 --> 02:46:54,630
B, B is to attack.

2747
02:46:55,890 --> 02:46:56,450
Baby.

2748
02:46:57,410 --> 02:46:58,150
Baby, baby, baby.

2749
02:46:58,470 --> 02:46:58,590
Wait.

2750
02:46:59,810 --> 02:47:00,030
Oh.

2751
02:47:02,630 --> 02:47:03,850
I think we're good, maybe.

2752
02:47:09,070 --> 02:47:10,330
I think we're good, maybe.

2753
02:47:12,290 --> 02:47:15,770
The camera is so fast.

2754
02:47:16,970 --> 02:47:17,530
Oh.

2755
02:47:19,530 --> 02:47:19,670
Oh.

2756
02:47:20,010 --> 02:47:20,390
Did I go?

2757
02:47:21,030 --> 02:47:21,590
What?

2758
02:47:22,030 --> 02:47:22,490
No!

2759
02:47:22,630 --> 02:47:22,970
Please!

2760
02:47:23,130 --> 02:47:23,390
No!

2761
02:47:23,510 --> 02:47:24,010
I didn't!

2762
02:47:24,010 --> 02:47:24,850
I didn't pay too!

2763
02:47:28,470 --> 02:47:29,030
Save.

2764
02:47:30,350 --> 02:47:30,910
Save.

2765
02:47:31,850 --> 02:47:33,630
Oh, safe.

2766
02:47:34,930 --> 02:47:36,630
No, it was so fast.

2767
02:47:42,200 --> 02:47:43,000
La, la, la.

2768
02:47:44,360 --> 02:47:44,880
La.

2769
02:47:48,060 --> 02:47:49,920
This goes back outside, doesn't it?

2770
02:47:50,220 --> 02:47:50,460
Uh-oh.

2771
02:47:53,560 --> 02:48:00,940
I don't want to shoot the cams yet until we get the
suppressor for the, uh, for the SOCOM.

2772
02:48:02,340 --> 02:48:03,920
Just imagining things.

2773
02:48:05,880 --> 02:48:06,840
imagining things.

2774
02:48:07,740 --> 02:48:09,000
So true.

2775
02:48:11,100 --> 02:48:12,140
So true.

2776
02:48:12,440 --> 02:48:13,440
Just imagining things.

2777
02:48:15,880 --> 02:48:20,180
Is there any way to get down from here or does this just go
outside?

2778
02:48:20,860 --> 02:48:22,900
I don't want to go outside yet or again.

2779
02:48:26,640 --> 02:48:28,000
It's so bright out.

2780
02:48:31,380 --> 02:48:32,180
Is there anything in here?

2781
02:48:33,500 --> 02:48:33,980
Hmm.

2782
02:48:36,220 --> 02:48:36,620
Hello.

2783
02:48:37,660 --> 02:48:38,640
Is there any items though?

2784
02:48:39,620 --> 02:48:39,840
Nope.

2785
02:48:40,700 --> 02:48:40,880
Okay.

2786
02:48:41,240 --> 02:48:42,240
All the way back.

2787
02:48:43,880 --> 02:48:45,000
Maybe the...

2788
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:45,280
Maybe the...

2789
02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:48,040
Maybe they don't know where I am.

2790
02:48:48,560 --> 02:48:49,880
Maybe it got rid of the alert.

2791
02:48:51,480 --> 02:48:51,740
Right?

2792
02:48:53,060 --> 02:48:53,620
Yeah.

2793
02:48:54,560 --> 02:48:57,040
Yeah, it just got rid of it probably.

2794
02:48:59,920 --> 02:49:01,040
Nothing here.

2795
02:49:01,260 --> 02:49:01,820
Nothing here.

2796
02:49:02,020 --> 02:49:02,240
Oh, see?

2797
02:49:02,460 --> 02:49:03,640
Nothing here.

2798
02:49:09,100 --> 02:49:20,320
right but that guy who was asleep he's gonna be my biggest
worry because we're gonna not know if he is staring at us or

2799
02:49:20,320 --> 02:49:24,600
not we're not he's probably awake now

2800
02:49:27,780 --> 02:49:29,860
okay and the camera

2801
02:49:34,640 --> 02:49:41,880
um what's our best What's our best call to action here?

2802
02:49:42,260 --> 02:49:43,940
Oh, I can hear him.

2803
02:49:47,570 --> 02:49:48,470
Oh, I can hear him.

2804
02:49:51,640 --> 02:49:52,560
Can I get him from here?

2805
02:49:55,540 --> 02:49:57,120
Oh, I missed my shot.

2806

Oh, wait.

2810
02:50:06,260 --> 02:50:08,140
If I press A, it doesn't come out.

Um... Is he walking away?

2818
02:50:52,670 --> 02:50:53,250
I think we're good.

2819
02:50:54,210 --> 02:50:55,070
Can I go down?

2820
02:50:55,510 --> 02:50:55,670
Hello?

2821
02:50:55,890 --> 02:50:56,530
How do I go down?

2822
02:50:57,210 --> 02:50:57,910
Nothing here.

2823
02:50:58,390 --> 02:50:58,990
Nothing here.

2824
02:50:59,590 --> 02:51:02,250
Please don't... Please don't notice me.

2825
02:51:02,350 --> 02:51:03,210
Okay, good, good, good, good, good.

2826
02:51:04,210 --> 02:51:05,090
Okay, here we go.

2827
02:51:06,130 --> 02:51:06,630
This is...

2828
02:51:12,050 --> 02:51:13,870
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2829
02:51:14,030 --> 02:51:14,870
How do I drop down?

2830
02:51:15,430 --> 02:51:16,330
Drop down.

2831
02:51:17,610 --> 02:51:17,770
Yeah.

2832
02:51:18,590 --> 02:51:19,670
We gotta go through.

2833
02:51:22,810 --> 02:51:23,250
Oh,

2834
02:51:30,920 --> 02:51:31,000

2835
02:51:31,300 --> 02:51:32,560
I said it keeps saying Huey!

2836
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:33,600
Oh, no.

2837
02:51:33,840 --> 02:51:35,180
My brain is poisoned.

2838
02:51:35,820 --> 02:51:37,560
My brain is poisoned, you guys.

2839
02:51:37,880 --> 02:51:39,620
No, not Huey.

2840
02:51:46,430 --> 02:51:46,870
Shit.

2841
02:52:07,160 --> 02:52:08,220
Take him over here.

2842
02:52:08,720 --> 02:52:10,520
I'm getting a little bit more used to the controls now.

2843
02:52:10,540 --> 02:52:11,580
Yippee!

2844
02:52:13,260 --> 02:52:13,640

02:52:13,980 --> 02:52:14,780
Thank you, sir!

2846
02:52:16,060 --> 02:52:16,660
Okay.

2847
02:52:17,260 --> 02:52:18,600
Where's our other friend at?

2848
02:52:30,790 --> 02:52:33,090
I'm not gonna get that guy because he scares me.

2849
02:52:37,380 --> 02:52:37,800
What?

2850
02:52:41,940 --> 02:52:42,840
Just run.

2851
02:52:48,180 --> 02:52:49,740
Oh, it's this guy.

2852
02:52:49,840 --> 02:52:50,660
I forgot about him.

2853
02:52:53,140 --> 02:52:54,320
Oh shit!

2854
02:52:54,660 --> 02:52:55,160
Oh gosh!

2855
02:52:56,040 --> 02:52:57,080
Never mind.

2856
02:53:02,220 --> 02:53:02,580
Um...

2857
02:53:03,140 --> 02:53:04,180
We're okay!

2858
02:53:05,460 --> 02:53:06,140
Everything's good!

2859
02:53:06,800 --> 02:53:08,360
How do I attach the suppressor?

2860
02:53:12,700 --> 02:53:14,080
Get out of here, Huey.

2861
02:53:14,160 --> 02:53:14,660
SMH.

2862
02:53:16,620 --> 02:53:17,060
Truth.

2863
02:53:21,980 --> 02:53:23,100
Resp-on.

2867
02:53:32,600 --> 02:53:33,120
Attach!

2868
02:53:33,500 --> 02:53:34,020
Yippee!

2869
02:53:35,280 --> 02:53:36,860
Now we can kill!

2870
02:53:40,060 --> 02:53:40,580
Without...

2871
02:53:40,580 --> 02:53:41,880
Without worry!

2872
02:53:47,470 --> 02:53:48,350
Thank you.

2873
02:53:50,930 --> 02:53:52,030
They're not gonna come in here.

2874
02:53:53,290 --> 02:53:54,110
Oh my god.

2875
02:53:54,390 --> 02:53:56,210
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

I was just like, Merrill, when are you going to open the
door for us to go?

2898
02:55:37,490 --> 02:55:39,610

But I knew you were.

2918
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:40,280
How?

2919
02:56:40,960 --> 02:56:41,840
It's your eyes.

2920
02:56:42,380 --> 02:56:43,060
My eyes?

2921
02:56:43,200 --> 02:56:43,900
My eyes?

2922
02:56:45,580 --> 02:56:53,060
they're rookies eyes right no they're beautiful and
compassionate eyes just what I'd expect from the legendary

2923
02:56:53,060 --> 02:57:00,600
solid snake I'm trying to sweep me off my feet Wow don't
worry you'll land back on them once you meet me the reality

2924
02:57:00,600 --> 02:57:07,780
is no match for the legend I'm afraid I have more confidence
now why did you look so surprised when you saw my face the

2925
02:57:07,780 --> 02:57:16,960
reason just like him you mean the terrorist leader liquid
snake liquid yeah you know him you're not are you I have no

2926
02:57:16,960 --> 02:57:25,060
family so what's the deal then I don't know I killed my dad
maybe I'll ask him personally but first I miss womanizing

2927
02:57:25,060 --> 02:57:31,680
snake you were involved in this exercise from the beginning
what exactly happened here I just joined the training that

2928
02:57:31,680 --> 02:57:39,340
same day that's okay but what is this place I don't think
it's just a nuclear weapon disposal facility yeah it's a

2929
02:57:39,340 --> 02:57:47,560
little weird it's just like them nobody's told you anything
did they nope okay you see this place isn't really for

2930
02:57:47,560 --> 02:57:55,200
disposing nuclear weapons this base is owned and operated by
a dummy corporation of arms tech this is a civilian base

2931
02:57:55,860 --> 02:58:03,600
right for the development of metal gear Colonel Foxhound and
the next generation special forces trying to get home called

2932
02:58:03,600 --> 02:58:10,260
here for the test launch actually I think I have a pizza on
the head I was gonna have it yesterday but because pizza you

2933
02:58:10,260 --> 02:58:18,360
read my mind they figured they could help keep it all hush
but they must have been test firing dummy warheads for a

2934
02:58:18,360 --> 02:58:25,100
while why just this time I heard it was making me a little
shaky test before the formal adoption of the metal gear

2935
02:58:25,100 --> 02:58:29,000
program so I have to go start that's what I heard anyway
when I went to the bathroom I should have started the oven

2936
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:36,700
sounds kind of fishy so what do you think the terrorists
want sorry I'm not sure I was captured with President Baker

2937
02:58:36,700 --> 02:58:43,800
right after the revolt started damn oh yeah that's when he
gave you the detonation calorie made right that's right

2938
02:58:43,800 --> 02:58:54,100
amazing articulated python well women have more hiding
places than men more anyway you met girly huh how's he

2939
02:58:54,100 --> 02:59:03,240
holding up girly he's dead what heart attack what do you

2940
02:59:03,240 --> 02:59:10,760
was either them sick or anything no not that i heard of you
know first time i get it but second time it's a little

2941
02:59:10,760 --> 02:59:15,140
suspicious something funny is going on Huh, sounds like it.

2942
02:59:15,360 --> 02:59:16,680
But I have no idea what.

2943
02:59:17,340 --> 02:59:17,820
Me neither.

2944
02:59:17,980 --> 02:59:18,460
Dinner.

2945
02:59:19,320 --> 02:59:20,520
Diazepam and cigarettes.

2946
02:59:20,540 --> 02:59:21,900
Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear?

2947
02:59:22,620 --> 02:59:23,740
You mean Dr. Emmerich?

2948
02:59:24,020 --> 02:59:24,460
How?

2949
02:59:24,820 --> 02:59:26,140
He should be in the research lab.

2950
02:59:26,260 --> 02:59:26,440
Not Huey.

2951
02:59:28,820 --> 02:59:30,520
I can't believe I kept saying Huey.

2952
02:59:30,980 --> 02:59:31,560
Second floor basement.

2953
02:59:32,280 --> 02:59:32,440
Yeah.

2954
02:59:32,760 --> 02:59:33,380
Second floor basement.

2955
02:59:33,380 --> 02:59:34,220
That's where his lab is.

2956
02:59:34,840 --> 02:59:37,680
I think they're forcing him to work on the nuclear launching
program.

2957
02:59:38,580 --> 02:59:41,020
So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway.

2958
02:59:41,080 --> 02:59:41,460
Thank you.

2959
02:59:41,480 --> 02:59:42,860
Then we'd better do something before.

2960
02:59:42,880 --> 02:59:47,400
Going to the bathroom is important since you never know when
a long cutscene will begin.

2961
02:59:47,760 --> 02:59:50,700
I need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear.

2962
02:59:51,280 --> 02:59:53,700
You plan to take that thing on by yourself, Snake?

2963
02:59:53,840 --> 02:59:54,200
Oh yeah.

2964
02:59:54,300 --> 02:59:55,580
It won't be the first time.

2965
02:59:55,700 --> 02:59:56,100
Woo!

2966
02:59:56,240 --> 02:59:57,500
It's so cool!

2967
02:59:57,940 --> 03:00:01,720
How do we get to the nuclear warhead storage where the
doctor's being held?

2968
03:00:02,320 --> 03:00:05,780
There's a cargo door on the first floor of this building
that leads to the north.

2969
03:00:06,140 --> 03:00:08,100
What's the security level of the door there?

2970
03:00:08,400 --> 03:00:08,760
Five.

2971
03:00:09,180 --> 03:00:09,620
Five!

2972
03:00:09,860 --> 03:00:10,080
It's okay.

2973
03:00:10,560 --> 03:00:11,540
I've got a level five.

2974
03:00:11,540 --> 03:00:11,880
Oh.

2975
03:00:13,080 --> 03:00:14,580
I've got to go save the doctor.

2976
03:00:15,220 --> 03:00:17,220
You should go to the I'm going with you.

2977
03:00:17,460 --> 03:00:19,620
No, you're just gonna get my way You're still too green.

2978
03:00:20,060 --> 03:00:21,200
I want you to hide somewhere.

2979
03:00:21,300 --> 03:00:22,720
I told you to be a good girl.

2980
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:29,520
Oh, yes, you are You pause for just one second in front of
your enemy and it's all over.

2981
03:00:29,740 --> 03:00:32,680
No, I'm still green too Good luck doesn't last forever five.

2982
03:00:33,040 --> 03:00:34,160
I don't know what happened.

2983
03:00:34,800 --> 03:00:39,600
I just couldn't pull the trigger right away sad music I
never had any problems in training

2984
03:00:42,880 --> 03:00:50,040
take someone's life it's not like shooting targets and
training what is this music I always dreamed of being a

2985
03:00:50,040 --> 03:00:57,860
soldier every day of my life I've trained my mind and body
for the one day when I could finally see some real action

2986
03:00:57,860 --> 03:01:06,860
and now oh this is different you want to quit I can't quit I
can't allow myself to quit now listen you're not normal if

2987
03:01:06,860 --> 03:01:13,480
you don't feel something the first time you kill I don't
hate it but killing without guilt produces more carnage In a

2988
03:01:13,480 --> 03:01:14,520
war, you'll get used to it.

2989
03:01:14,520 --> 03:01:17,600
All of mankind's worst emotions, worst traits emerge.

2990
03:01:18,200 --> 03:01:21,480
It's easy to forget what a sin is in the middle of a
battlefield.

2991
03:01:22,220 --> 03:01:23,240
But this isn't a war.

2992
03:01:23,520 --> 03:01:24,780
It's a terrorist action.

2993
03:01:25,340 --> 03:01:27,340
You're just a little jumpy from the combat high.

2994
03:01:28,020 --> 03:01:30,260
The adrenaline in your bloodstream is starting to thin out.

2995
03:01:30,780 --> 03:01:31,660
Just take it easy.

2996
03:01:31,880 --> 03:01:34,620
But I learned all about combat high at the academy.

2997
03:01:35,380 --> 03:01:36,760
We'll talk about it later.

2998
03:01:37,280 --> 03:01:40,000
For now, just think about keeping yourself alive.

2999
03:01:40,020 --> 03:01:40,800
Can you open the door for me?

3000
03:01:40,900 --> 03:01:41,900
I think of a trouble.

3001
03:01:42,880 --> 03:01:50,240

hall okay let me try to say this another way stay the hell

Yeah, we'll go back to the armory and go get it.

3009
03:02:46,440 --> 03:02:46,720
You know what?

3010
03:02:46,740 --> 03:02:48,880
Because we're right here by the...

3011
03:02:50,900 --> 03:02:52,860

3018
03:03:10,310 --> 03:03:11,110
Press the button!

3019
03:03:11,570 --> 03:03:12,090
Thank you.

3020
03:03:12,610 --> 03:03:13,290
Oh, my God.

Please, please, please, please.

3022
03:03:14,450 --> 03:03:14,770
Oh, God.

3023

Oh, God.

3024
03:03:17,090 --> 03:03:17,930
They're both coming.

3025
03:03:18,030 --> 03:03:18,670
They're both coming.

3026
03:03:32,800 --> 03:03:34,660
Ah, easy.

3027
03:03:36,140 --> 03:03:38,120
Which, uh, does it be?

3028
03:03:39,300 --> 03:03:39,620
Two.

3029
03:04:14,730 --> 03:04:16,390
Oh, oh.

3030
03:04:19,110 --> 03:04:19,810
Who's there?

3031
03:04:20,170 --> 03:04:20,770
No one.

3032
03:04:21,610 --> 03:04:22,530
Who's that?

3033
03:04:22,730 --> 03:04:23,530
Oh, um.

3034
03:04:23,770 --> 03:04:24,410
It's the enemy.

3035
03:04:24,650 --> 03:04:25,630
I need- It is?

3036
03:04:26,250 --> 03:04:29,130
Oh, come on!

3037
03:04:29,210 --> 03:04:30,170
Let me just get that gun!

3038
03:04:32,510 --> 03:04:34,670
Um, I'll go in blasting.

3039
03:04:35,870 --> 03:04:44,990
I don't like the alert oh my gosh there's a ton of you get

03:04:56,360 --> 03:05:01,880
What yo Is this a trap?

3042
03:05:02,620 --> 03:05:11,600
I think this one's a trap This one we need the cigarettes
for yeah Are they

3043
03:05:24,300 --> 03:05:25,000
gonna come in here?

3044
03:05:26,740 --> 03:05:28,740
That was so close!

3045
03:05:31,100 --> 03:05:32,880
That was so close!

3046
03:05:34,440 --> 03:05:36,980
They won't come in here because what are they gonna do?

3047
03:05:37,380 --> 03:05:38,300
Pass through the lasers?

3048
03:05:38,780 --> 03:05:39,400
They can't.

3049
03:05:42,740 --> 03:05:43,040
What?

3050
03:05:44,280 --> 03:05:45,740
Who just died?

3051
03:05:49,700 --> 03:05:50,380
Um.

3052
03:05:51,880 --> 03:05:52,560
Huh?

3053
03:05:57,860 --> 03:05:59,020
Just died.

3054
03:06:02,910 --> 03:06:04,250
He fell into the trap hole!

3055
03:06:04,850 --> 03:06:06,330
No way.

3056
03:06:09,430 --> 03:06:11,810
It's gonna run out and they're gonna leave.

3057
03:06:19,170 --> 03:06:19,570
Okay.

3058
03:06:20,430 --> 03:06:21,850
He just does that.

3059
03:06:24,330 --> 03:06:25,790
I almost pressed the wrong button.

3060
03:06:25,990 --> 03:06:27,930
I almost pressed A when I had it equipped.

3061
03:06:49,480 --> 03:06:51,480
Press Y button for safety?

3062
03:06:53,640 --> 03:06:54,020
What do you mean?

3063
03:06:54,220 --> 03:06:55,680
Wait, I can turn the safety on?

3064
03:06:56,960 --> 03:06:57,840
Probably should save.

3065
03:06:58,040 --> 03:07:00,300
You are so right.

3066
03:07:03,040 --> 03:07:05,040
Can you call it fake?

3067
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:14,960
It's the one, it's the theme they don't use anymore.

3068
03:07:17,220 --> 03:07:17,760
Save complete.

3069
03:07:17,860 --> 03:07:17,940
Okay.

3070
03:07:19,440 --> 03:07:20,860
Come on, Melein, give me that.

3071
03:07:21,260 --> 03:07:26,780
Snake, in China they say you must cross the river before you
tell the crocodile he has bad...

3072
03:07:26,780 --> 03:07:28,860
Oh, let's also call the colonel since we got a Meryl.

3073
03:07:29,520 --> 03:07:32,100
It means that the wise man avoids danger first.

3074
03:07:32,700 --> 03:07:34,220
Use your brain to avoid traps.

3075
03:07:34,800 --> 03:07:35,960
And stay away from the enemy.

3076
03:07:36,340 --> 03:07:36,960
Avoid the traps.

3077
03:07:37,140 --> 03:07:37,840
I got you, girl.

3078
03:07:38,560 --> 03:07:40,840
I was so smart before.

3079
03:07:41,980 --> 03:07:45,620
I had copyright issues, right?

3080
03:07:46,540 --> 03:07:49,860
Yeah, it was very similar.

3081
03:07:50,100 --> 03:07:50,920
Wait, no!

3082
03:07:51,420 --> 03:07:53,000
Colonel, your nephew!

3083
03:07:54,640 --> 03:07:55,160
Your nephew.

3084
03:07:55,320 --> 03:07:55,580
Neese.

3085
03:07:55,920 --> 03:07:56,280
Neese.

3086
03:07:58,000 --> 03:07:59,160
Your niece!

3087
03:08:01,180 --> 03:08:08,540
Yeah, it was very similar to a Russian composed song.

3088
03:08:08,560 --> 03:08:21,400
so unfortunately it had to be um had to could not use it
anymore so sad oh there's the hole that is oh i thought that

3089
03:08:21,400 --> 03:08:28,480

come back, please, please.

3092
03:09:10,270 --> 03:09:12,610
Wait, Minty, reheat your pizza in the oven?

3093
03:09:13,530 --> 03:09:15,390
No, it's, um...

3094
03:09:15,390 --> 03:09:17,610
Snake, I unlocked the cargo door for you.

3095
03:09:17,730 --> 03:09:19,770
It's, uh, it's one of those, like, oven pizzas.

3096
03:09:20,370 --> 03:09:21,930
Where I can see ya?

3097
03:09:22,270 --> 03:09:23,930
Don't move around too much.

3098
03:09:24,010 --> 03:09:25,350
Where I can see ya?

3099
03:09:25,570 --> 03:09:26,970
Ghost Mid finally awakes.

3100
03:09:27,670 --> 03:09:29,930
Praise Smash Ball, thank you for the super die!

3101
03:09:30,770 --> 03:09:31,950
What does that mean?

3102
03:09:32,010 --> 03:09:32,890
It's been nine years.

3103
03:09:33,170 --> 03:09:33,690
Nothing.

3104
03:09:34,650 --> 03:09:35,050
Listen, Snake.

3105
03:09:35,490 --> 03:09:37,150
The cargo door is like an airlock.

3106
03:09:37,890 --> 03:09:39,730
It's equipped with infrared sensors.

3107
03:09:40,450 --> 03:09:40,990
Be careful.

3108
03:09:41,250 --> 03:09:42,370
Wait, where is the...

3109
03:09:42,370 --> 03:09:44,270
If an intruder is sensed, gas is released.

3110
03:09:45,210 --> 03:09:45,230
Gas.

3111
03:09:46,250 --> 03:09:48,850
Okay, so we'll meet at the nuclear warhead storage building.

3112
03:09:49,390 --> 03:09:51,270
I thought you said you'd be a good girl.

3113
03:09:52,510 --> 03:09:54,070
I changed my mind.

3114
03:09:54,370 --> 03:09:55,570
Don't get careless.

3115
03:09:56,110 --> 03:09:57,710
That's when things always turn sour.

3116
03:09:57,730 --> 03:09:58,630
You said you'd be a good girl.

3117
03:09:58,690 --> 03:09:58,990
Sorry.

3118
03:09:58,990 --> 03:10:05,130
but this is the only way I can figure whether or not I'm cut
out to be a soldier um I gotta get my hands dirty actually

3119
03:10:05,130 --> 03:10:12,570
where can I get the thermal goggles yet get yourself killed
because the one room had the suppressor and the other

3120
03:10:20,060 --> 03:10:20,980
had wait

3121
03:10:36,860 --> 03:10:44,000
be careful snake that airlock is set with infrared sensors
what is it what is it you probably can't see them with your

3122
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:47,020
naked eyes but there are infrared beams coming out of that
wall.

3123
03:10:47,740 --> 03:10:51,720
Touch any one of them and the doors will seal off and the
place will be flooded with poison gas.

3124
03:10:52,860 --> 03:10:55,480
Somehow you've got to get through without setting off those
sensors.

3125
03:10:56,080 --> 03:10:57,920
I'm gonna die from the cigarettes!

3126
03:10:59,060 --> 03:11:00,040
Cigarettes are gonna kill me.

3127
03:11:01,060 --> 03:11:02,020
Uh, okay.

3128
03:11:05,860 --> 03:11:07,300
Okay, this one's slow.

3129
03:11:13,710 --> 03:11:14,970
Don't see me in here.

3130
03:11:16,170 --> 03:11:17,990
Oh, it's really...

3131
03:11:18,990 --> 03:11:19,470
Okay.

3132
03:11:21,710 --> 03:11:22,590
Nothing here.

3133
03:11:23,170 --> 03:11:24,130
Yep, nothing here.

3134
03:11:25,270 --> 03:11:26,010
Nice and easy.

3135
03:11:30,010 --> 03:11:31,410
I wonder if I should use one.

3136
03:11:34,290 --> 03:11:35,730
What is Mint's alignment?

3137
03:11:35,930 --> 03:11:36,290
Good girl?

3138
03:11:36,470 --> 03:11:36,870
Bad girl?

3139
03:11:37,070 --> 03:11:37,630
Neutral girl?

3140
03:11:38,610 --> 03:11:39,050
Hmm.

3141
03:11:39,870 --> 03:11:43,290
I think I was a good girl, but I changed my mind.

3142
03:11:46,830 --> 03:11:49,090
I think I will use it just in case, though.

3143
03:11:49,230 --> 03:11:50,630
We're about to go into another fight.

3144
03:11:51,650 --> 03:11:52,930
So we'll get some more rations.

3145
03:11:55,390 --> 03:11:56,510
Uh, okay.

3146
03:12:00,270 --> 03:12:01,810
Okay, that one is down.

3147
03:12:01,970 --> 03:12:03,250
It's really slow.

3148
03:12:04,090 --> 03:12:05,550
So now probably is...

3149
03:12:05,550 --> 03:12:07,150
Okay, it's going back up.

3150
03:12:07,290 --> 03:12:09,530
It's so slow.

3151
03:12:11,970 --> 03:12:13,670
This one's not so bad.

3152
03:12:18,890 --> 03:12:19,610
Yippee!

3153
03:12:22,570 --> 03:12:24,710
I'm gonna bad girl.

3154
03:12:24,770 --> 03:12:25,790
I changed my mind.

3155
03:12:25,890 --> 03:12:29,130
I'm a bad girl now.

3156
03:12:31,670 --> 03:12:34,850
Good thing we got the grenades.

3157
03:12:43,050 --> 03:12:44,510
Be careful.

3158
03:12:45,490 --> 03:12:47,490
There are claymore mines around there.

3159
03:12:47,790 --> 03:12:48,210
Who are you?

3160
03:12:48,450 --> 03:12:48,850
Who is this?

3161
03:12:50,150 --> 03:12:50,690
Who is this?

3162
03:12:50,690 --> 03:12:50,910
Who are you?

3163
03:12:51,290 --> 03:12:51,950
Who is this?

3164
03:12:51,950 --> 03:12:53,550
Just call me Deep Throat.

3165
03:12:54,270 --> 03:12:55,210
Deep Throat.

3166
03:12:55,650 --> 03:12:57,250
The informant from the Watergate scandal.

3167
03:12:58,130 --> 03:13:05,270
about that you're not using burst transmission are you
nearby listen there's a tank in front of your position

3168
03:13:05,270 --> 03:13:17,730
waiting to ambush you what are you anyway one of your fans
me you're one of my fans huh um i am gonna save too and

3169
03:13:17,730 --> 03:13:23,990
let's let's actually call campbell too because we didn't do
that yet colonel i got a codec oh we missed the one i guess

3170
03:13:23,990 --> 03:13:31,350
about maryl my bad i know we were Mailing knows everything
about the communication system.

3171
03:13:31,630 --> 03:13:31,730
He's a wisp.

3172
03:13:31,730 --> 03:13:32,270
It's part of the fandom.

3173
03:13:33,710 --> 03:13:36,410
Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you.

3174
03:13:37,150 --> 03:13:39,330
But the question is, how did he learn it?

3175
03:13:39,550 --> 03:13:40,990
It's top-secret information.

3176
03:13:41,950 --> 03:13:44,070
So you mean someone leaked the information?

3177
03:13:45,070 --> 03:13:47,010
And that's the only explanation I can think of.

3178
03:13:47,110 --> 03:13:48,490
Who's got my number?

3179
03:13:48,850 --> 03:13:51,490
Do you know where that transmission originated from?

3180
03:13:51,550 --> 03:13:52,670
Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?

3181
03:13:52,670 --> 03:13:52,970
I'm sorry.

3182
03:13:53,470 --> 03:13:58,110
The radio waves were too weak to locate their source, but
I'm sure he's near you.

3183
03:13:58,610 --> 03:14:01,470
Snake, you'll have to go through the minefield to advance.

3184
03:14:02,810 --> 03:14:03,050
Okay.

3185
03:14:05,830 --> 03:14:06,270
Um...

3186
03:14:06,270 --> 03:14:07,550
Hey, Master Miller.

3187
03:14:07,950 --> 03:14:11,370
Master, does the name Deep Throat mean anything to you?

3188
03:14:12,110 --> 03:14:12,410
Deep Throat?

3189
03:14:13,270 --> 03:14:13,550
What?

3190
03:14:13,730 --> 03:14:15,430
You mean the guy from Watergate?

3191
03:14:15,770 --> 03:14:16,050
No.

3192
03:14:16,530 --> 03:14:17,650
But he uses the same name.

3193
03:14:17,650 --> 03:14:18,050
No.

3194
03:14:18,250 --> 03:14:19,090
How do you know, Snake?

3195
03:14:19,210 --> 03:14:19,670
You don't know?

3196
03:14:20,270 --> 03:14:22,270
You don't know if it's the same guy from Watergate?

3197
03:14:23,430 --> 03:14:24,830
You can't say for sure.

3198
03:14:25,050 --> 03:14:25,930
You don't even know who he is.

3199
03:14:26,110 --> 03:14:27,350
He wasn't using burst transmission.

3200
03:14:28,130 --> 03:14:38,430
he was transmitting from somewhere on this base somewhere on
the base yes I have no idea master Miller is very intrigued

3201
03:14:38,430 --> 03:14:46,350
in this information he's like who else is on the base hey
Merrill do you know a deep throat sounds like his mind

3202
03:14:46,350 --> 03:14:52,110
sounds like harassment if I ask her you'll be able to see
the minds displayed on your hey Merrill do you know deep

3203
03:14:52,110 --> 03:14:54,570
throat oh we didn't even ask her okay we

3204
03:14:58,950 --> 03:14:59,830
Some class.

3205
03:15:01,070 --> 03:15:05,850
After you locate the mines on your radar, crawl forward and
retrieve them.

3206
03:15:05,850 --> 03:15:07,590
Oh, I'm gonna crawl forward and retrieve them.

3207
03:15:07,670 --> 03:15:10,730
Anti-personnel mines have killed over 20,000 non-combatants
in the past 30 years.

3208
03:15:10,730 --> 03:15:11,350
Is that real?

3209
03:15:11,790 --> 03:15:18,110
In countries like Cambodia and Nicaragua, the killing and
maiming of innocent victims continues long after the war has

3210
03:15:18,110 --> 03:15:18,470
ended.

3211
03:15:19,010 --> 03:15:21,210
It is easy to plant the mines, you see.

3212
03:15:21,810 --> 03:15:23,510
But removing them is a different matter.

3213
03:15:23,570 --> 03:15:24,210
She's out.

3214
03:15:24,290 --> 03:15:25,510
It requires more time and manpower.

3215
03:15:25,510 --> 03:15:27,550
She was like, oh, she didn't even let us ask.

3216
03:15:27,590 --> 03:15:29,410
She was like, By the way, bombs.

3217
03:15:29,650 --> 03:15:33,350
The superpowers need to donate more mine detectors and other
equipment to remove them.

3218
03:15:34,010 --> 03:15:36,490
It is the least we could do after laying them.

3219
03:15:37,670 --> 03:15:43,590
People still find, like, grenades and stuff to this day,
which is insane to me.

3220
03:15:45,270 --> 03:15:45,970
Pick up.

3221
03:15:46,490 --> 03:15:49,790
If you're one of my fans, isn't it an honor to have me call
you?

3222
03:15:50,690 --> 03:15:51,870
Wouldn't you be like, wow!

3223
03:15:53,650 --> 03:15:55,070
A minefield, huh?

3224
03:15:55,870 --> 03:15:57,730
Don't forget to use your mine detector.

3225
03:15:58,130 --> 03:15:58,690
I got it.

3226
03:15:58,930 --> 03:16:02,990
When you find out where a mine is, crawl forward and try to
recover it.

3227
03:16:03,490 --> 03:16:06,550
In this game, does it matter which way I crawl towards it?

3228
03:16:07,670 --> 03:16:08,470
Does it have...

3229
03:16:08,470 --> 03:16:08,970
Do I have to...

3230
03:16:08,970 --> 03:16:09,570
Okay.

3231
03:16:10,070 --> 03:16:11,950
Do I have to crawl from behind?

3232
03:16:14,350 --> 03:16:15,490
What can I do for you, Snake?

3233
03:16:16,250 --> 03:16:17,210
I'm just saving.

3234
03:16:17,730 --> 03:16:18,050
You know.

3235
03:16:26,610 --> 03:16:27,830
Don't forget to save.

3236
03:16:30,030 --> 03:16:31,150
Too shy to pick up.

3237
03:16:32,030 --> 03:16:33,090
Wow, the save is so fast.

3238
03:16:35,230 --> 03:16:36,290
How's it going, Snake?

3239
03:16:36,630 --> 03:16:37,930
Have you gotten used to the radar yet?

3240
03:16:38,170 --> 03:16:39,050
I'm getting there.

3241
03:16:39,970 --> 03:16:43,110
Imagine if Master Mellet answered, who told you that code
name?

3242
03:16:44,210 --> 03:16:45,210
Pretty convenient, huh?

3243
03:16:45,610 --> 03:16:47,950
It also makes it easy for us to see everything that you're
doing.

3244
03:16:48,310 --> 03:16:49,090
You're watching everything?

3245
03:16:49,330 --> 03:16:49,970
Of course.

3246
03:16:50,430 --> 03:16:53,090
If you were my boyfriend, you'd never be able to cheat on
me.

3247
03:16:53,250 --> 03:16:53,270
Oh!

3248
03:16:53,370 --> 03:16:57,250
Being monitored 24 hours a day, that'd be like hell.

3249
03:16:57,630 --> 03:16:59,050
Don't think of it like that.

3250
03:16:59,510 --> 03:17:00,850
At least you'd never get lost.

3251
03:17:01,930 --> 03:17:03,130
Snake does not like being...

3252
03:17:03,150 --> 03:17:09,390
watched i'll tell you years ago when i was in another unit
my unit's morale was at an all-time low it was up to me to

3253
03:17:09,390 --> 03:17:18,110
boost their morale somehow what do you mean by that what
what what what what do you what do you what do you mean by

3254
03:17:18,110 --> 03:17:23,790
that customer johnson what do you mean by that

3255
03:17:27,080 --> 03:17:33,700
is the mine oh the mindy oh holy cow that was so close

3256
03:17:39,740 --> 03:17:44,200
Nope, turn around.

3257
03:17:46,080 --> 03:17:47,220
Just like that.

3258
03:17:49,280 --> 03:17:49,980
Be a good girl.

3259
03:17:50,960 --> 03:17:52,000
And then I can get up.

3260
03:17:52,680 --> 03:17:53,580
And we can go this way.

3261
03:17:54,480 --> 03:17:55,080
I don't...

3262
03:17:55,080 --> 03:17:57,800
I'm too scared to know if I have to...

3263
03:17:59,840 --> 03:18:01,840
If I have to approach him from behind or not.

3264
03:18:01,980 --> 03:18:02,460
You know what I mean?

3265
03:18:03,360 --> 03:18:03,780
Spin.

3266
03:18:05,880 --> 03:18:07,520
But I guess, maybe not.

3267
03:18:08,500 --> 03:18:10,260
Because I can get...

3268
03:18:10,260 --> 03:18:11,140
These ones?

3269
03:18:12,820 --> 03:18:13,340
Or...

3270
03:18:14,240 --> 03:18:14,760
Uh...

3271
03:18:14,760 --> 03:18:15,760
Just go, just get them?

3272
03:18:16,840 --> 03:18:18,340
I'm afraid of triggering the cutscene.

3273
03:18:21,640 --> 03:18:22,100
Ooh.

3274
03:18:23,600 --> 03:18:25,560
That doesn't matter in the first game.

3275
03:18:26,500 --> 03:18:27,860
So, maybe it's fine.

3276
03:18:29,940 --> 03:18:30,880
They will not go off?

3277
03:18:31,080 --> 03:18:31,340
Okay.

3278
03:18:31,740 --> 03:18:32,940
I'm trusting you guys.

3279
03:18:33,020 --> 03:18:33,800
I'm trusting you guys.

3280
03:18:33,920 --> 03:18:34,660
I'm trusting you guys.

3281
03:18:36,600 --> 03:18:38,460
That's so evil.

3282
03:18:43,220 --> 03:18:43,700
Okay.

3283
03:18:47,800 --> 03:18:48,280
Okay.

3284
03:18:50,260 --> 03:18:51,500
That was scary.

3285
03:18:52,440 --> 03:18:53,260
That was so scary.

3286
03:18:54,020 --> 03:18:54,120
All right.

3287
03:18:54,220 --> 03:18:55,040
No more mind detector.

3288
03:18:55,360 --> 03:18:55,940
I think we're good.

3289
03:18:56,800 --> 03:18:57,680
Clip our rations.

3290
03:18:59,640 --> 03:19:00,120
Okay.

3291
03:19:00,340 --> 03:19:01,200
How to use the grenades.

3292
03:19:01,440 --> 03:19:03,560
Press a button to hold, release to throw.

3293
03:19:03,700 --> 03:19:04,680
How long button is pressed?

3294
03:19:05,760 --> 03:19:16,220
varies the distance and we got a couple chaff grenades not a
lot just a few but it should be enough to maybe get him

3295
03:19:16,220 --> 03:19:23,580
stunned a couple times oh when did we get magazines mint
boss i discovered you by metal gear when you were in heaven

3296
03:19:23,580 --> 03:19:29,420
over a year ago and became a fan i discovered a long term
health issue and had a rough time your positivity and metal

3297
03:19:29,420 --> 03:19:39,080

I'm glad that, or rather I hope you're doing better now, and

3298
03:19:39,080 --> 03:19:46,220
I hope that, um, or I'm glad that, uh, I was able to help
out even if just a little bit.

3299
03:19:50,680 --> 03:19:51,080
Okay.

3300
03:19:59,490 --> 03:20:01,850
I don't remember how to do this fight.

3301
03:20:02,370 --> 03:20:04,470
Like, I remember and I don't remember at the same time.

3302
03:20:04,730 --> 03:20:06,710
Oh my gosh, we're gonna see Vulcan Raven for the first time
though.

3303
03:20:06,750 --> 03:20:07,550
This is so exciting.

3304
03:20:09,750 --> 03:20:11,370
Come on out, buddy.

3305
03:20:16,080 --> 03:20:22,820
Like, you use the chaff to distract them, and then you throw
the grenade...

3306
03:20:22,820 --> 03:20:24,000
Oh, my ears.

3307
03:20:24,440 --> 03:20:25,900
You throw the grenade inside.

3308
03:20:27,880 --> 03:20:28,160
All right.

3309
03:20:30,120 --> 03:20:31,200
Average beat to burn doyer.

3310
03:20:31,300 --> 03:20:32,100
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

3311
03:20:32,720 --> 03:20:33,540
Uh, my D.

3312
03:20:34,360 --> 03:20:34,800
Wow!

3313
03:20:36,620 --> 03:20:37,060
Oh!

3314
03:20:39,100 --> 03:20:41,180
This is Raven's territory.

3315
03:20:41,500 --> 03:20:44,560
Oh, he's gonna say it!

3316
03:20:44,640 --> 03:20:46,760
Snakes don't belong in Alaska!

3317
03:20:47,080 --> 03:20:48,980
I will not let you pass.

3318
03:20:49,120 --> 03:20:50,460
He doesn't sound as cool.

3319
03:20:51,560 --> 03:20:52,040
Yeah!

3320
03:20:53,200 --> 03:20:56,020
Snakes don't belong in Alaska.

3321
03:20:57,280 --> 03:20:58,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3322
03:21:00,540 --> 03:21:01,840
Snake, don't just stand there.

3323
03:21:02,400 --> 03:21:03,600
Send him a message.

3324
03:21:03,940 --> 03:21:04,480
The bird.

3325
03:21:04,920 --> 03:21:05,700
Go, bird, go!

3326
03:21:06,580 --> 03:21:06,720
Ah!

3327
03:21:08,320 --> 03:21:10,820
Snake, what is wrong with you?

3328
03:21:10,920 --> 03:21:13,620
Oh, oh, oh.

3329
03:21:16,040 --> 03:21:18,900
Oh my god, Snake, what's wrong with you?

3330
03:21:20,360 --> 03:21:23,280
That's right, you belong on the ground.

3331
03:21:23,460 --> 03:21:25,380
Oh, I see, I hear it now, I hear it more now.

3332
03:21:26,460 --> 03:21:28,000
You belong on the ground.

3333
03:21:28,100 --> 03:21:29,840
I'm like a slithery snake.

3334
03:21:30,400 --> 03:21:31,460
A little snake.

3335
03:21:32,700 --> 03:21:36,200
You should crawl on the ground like the snake you are.

3336
03:21:38,580 --> 03:21:39,660
You are.

3337
03:21:40,300 --> 03:21:42,520
Come, let's fight.

3338
03:21:45,220 --> 03:21:47,140
Don't forget to shut it!

3339
03:21:48,480 --> 03:21:50,280
Yeah, don't forget to shut it, buddy.

3340
03:21:51,280 --> 03:21:52,800
Okay, um, let me also...

3341
03:21:53,580 --> 03:21:58,220
Wait, um, chaff grenades, press A to aim, release, to throw.

3342
03:21:58,360 --> 03:22:02,880
Okay, so we gotta get pretty close so we can, um...

3343
03:22:02,880 --> 03:22:04,320
We only have six though.

3344
03:22:05,940 --> 03:22:08,240
Okay, remember to punch the tank.

3345
03:22:08,400 --> 03:22:09,100
Can I actually?

3346
03:22:11,900 --> 03:22:12,360
Oh my god.

3347
03:22:12,620 --> 03:22:13,060
Oh!

3348
03:22:13,880 --> 03:22:14,400
Wait!

3349
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:18,640
Wait, why is there a...

3350
03:22:23,260 --> 03:22:25,360
He came out to laugh at me.

3351
03:22:26,400 --> 03:22:27,700
Oh my gosh.

3352
03:22:28,260 --> 03:22:29,640
Oh my gosh, I wish I could cartwheel right now.

3353
03:22:30,640 --> 03:22:31,260
Oh my god.

3354
03:22:31,580 --> 03:22:33,060
Okay, I'm just gonna throw the chap grenade.

3355
03:22:34,020 --> 03:22:35,220
Oh gosh, please!

3356
03:22:35,520 --> 03:22:35,940
Did I go?

3357
03:22:35,980 --> 03:22:36,500
I don't know if I...

3358
03:22:36,500 --> 03:22:37,180
Okay, I threw it.

3359
03:22:37,620 --> 03:22:37,960
Nice.

3360
03:22:40,420 --> 03:22:41,140
I'm dying.

3361
03:22:49,090 --> 03:22:49,450
Ouch.

3362
03:22:49,830 --> 03:22:50,430

Oh my god, snake, please!

3374
03:24:28,150 --> 03:24:30,930
Oh, that did not work.

3375
03:24:46,130 --> 03:24:47,090
See how you like this!

3376
03:24:47,190 --> 03:24:47,990
Oh, gunner two!

3377
03:24:48,610 --> 03:24:50,870
Oh, I pressed it, but it didn't work.

3378
03:24:50,990 --> 03:24:51,550
Okay, that's fine.

3379
03:24:52,590 --> 03:24:54,550
I don't think it registered because he was loading.

3380
03:24:55,350 --> 03:24:55,650
Ah!

3381
03:24:57,830 --> 03:24:59,890
It lands right in his lap.

3382
03:25:01,010 --> 03:25:03,630
It lands right in his lap.

3383
03:25:04,150 --> 03:25:05,310
It's so funny.

3384
03:25:08,010 --> 03:25:09,610
He's like holding on to it.

3385
03:25:10,090 --> 03:25:11,570
Oh, we have to wait for him to come back up.

3386
03:25:11,850 --> 03:25:12,430
Okay, there we go.

3387
03:25:12,630 --> 03:25:13,830
All right, come back, mister.

3388
03:25:16,190 --> 03:25:17,370
Don't run me over.

3389
03:25:17,490 --> 03:25:18,490
Don't run me over.

3390
03:25:19,450 --> 03:25:22,370
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3391
03:25:22,390 --> 03:25:22,830
Oh, gosh.

3392
03:25:23,050 --> 03:25:24,230
We only have one ration left.

3393
03:25:27,490 --> 03:25:29,110
Oh my god, get up, Snake.

3394
03:25:30,830 --> 03:25:36,250
Okay, I'm gonna chaff grenade real quick so that we can,
um...

3395
03:25:37,070 --> 03:25:39,490
Oh my gosh, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh
my god.

3396
03:25:39,610 --> 03:25:40,410
Where's some rations?

3397
03:25:40,750 --> 03:25:42,090
Please, please rations.

3398
03:25:42,370 --> 03:25:43,750
Oh no, no, no, there's no rations!

3399
03:25:45,270 --> 03:25:46,310
Oh no, there's no rations.

3400
03:25:46,970 --> 03:25:48,390
Okay, that's not good.

3401
03:25:55,800 --> 03:25:56,160
Uh...

3402
03:25:59,780 --> 03:26:02,740
I know I might be wasting them, but I don't want them to get
me with the...

3403
03:26:07,510 --> 03:26:08,650
I'm about dead.

3404
03:26:08,890 --> 03:26:09,430
I'm gonna die.

3405
03:26:10,110 --> 03:26:11,030
I'm gonna die for real!

3406
03:26:11,810 --> 03:26:12,650
Where are the rations?

3407
03:26:17,050 --> 03:26:18,610
I'm gonna die!

3408
03:26:27,850 --> 03:26:30,630
If he gets me one more time, I'm dead.

3409
03:26:32,190 --> 03:26:32,530
Boo!

3410
03:26:34,650 --> 03:26:35,550
I can't- Oh.

3411
03:26:36,030 --> 03:26:37,210
Uh, yeah, that's fine, actually.

3412
03:26:47,500 --> 03:26:48,160
So unfair.

3413
03:26:49,000 --> 03:26:50,620
This is so unfair!

3414
03:26:56,820 --> 03:26:58,080
Oh, that was a nice hit.

3415
03:27:00,000 --> 03:27:04,040
Oh, dang it, he's not there yet.

3416
03:27:09,160 --> 03:27:10,320
There are no rations.

3417
03:27:10,980 --> 03:27:12,500
I'm going to die again, please.

3418
03:27:26,970 --> 03:27:27,790
So unfair.

3419
03:27:28,150 --> 03:27:29,150
This is so unfair.

3420
03:27:43,100 --> 03:27:44,140
Don't get me.

3421
03:27:44,820 --> 03:27:45,440
Don't get me.

3422
03:27:46,040 --> 03:27:46,720
Don't get me.

3423
03:27:47,040 --> 03:27:47,600
Don't get me.

3424
03:27:48,400 --> 03:27:48,820
Don't.

3425
03:27:51,040 --> 03:27:51,860
Oh, my God.

3426
03:27:51,940 --> 03:27:52,700
Oh, there.

3427
03:27:52,960 --> 03:27:53,340
There he is.

3428
03:27:53,460 --> 03:27:53,680
There he is.

3429
03:27:53,900 --> 03:27:54,340
Nice, nice, nice.

3430
03:28:12,290 --> 03:28:13,670
We were so close.

3431
03:28:17,850 --> 03:28:18,750
Last time I did that fight.

3432
03:28:20,050 --> 03:28:22,790
I don't want to brag, but I did it in one try.

3433
03:28:27,410 --> 03:28:27,630
Chew.

3434
03:28:32,560 --> 03:28:33,780
That was too early.

3435
03:28:37,680 --> 03:28:38,240
There's nothing!

3436
03:28:40,660 --> 03:28:40,980
Yeah.

3437
03:28:41,980 --> 03:28:42,440
Yeah.

3438
03:28:49,450 --> 03:28:50,230
Oh, wait.

3439
03:28:50,390 --> 03:28:52,410
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

3440
03:28:52,850 --> 03:28:55,090
You wasted all the time laughing at me!

3441
03:28:56,050 --> 03:28:57,350
This is so unfair.

3442
03:28:57,870 --> 03:28:58,910
That's so unfair!

3443
03:28:59,730 --> 03:29:00,730
I can't believe!

3444
03:29:01,190 --> 03:29:02,790
That is so unfair.

3445
03:29:03,310 --> 03:29:04,230
No way.

3446
03:29:04,450 --> 03:29:06,250
Okay, well, I'm here now, I guess.

3447
03:29:07,170 --> 03:29:08,510
Oh, my god.

3448
03:29:17,770 --> 03:29:18,490
That's right.

3449
03:29:19,290 --> 03:29:20,910
And then he goes inside for a second.

3450
03:29:23,750 --> 03:29:24,350
Come back out.

3451
03:29:24,450 --> 03:29:24,670
Oh, wait.

3452
03:29:24,850 --> 03:29:26,070
I'm going to lose my health.

3453
03:29:31,830 --> 03:29:32,070
Oh, my God.

3454
03:29:32,110 --> 03:29:32,750
Don't run me over.

3455
03:29:33,510 --> 03:29:34,070
You know what?

3456
03:29:34,070 --> 03:29:34,390
It's fine.

3457
03:29:34,490 --> 03:29:34,610
Wait.

3458
03:29:34,710 --> 03:29:35,530
Did he go back in?

3459
03:29:35,950 --> 03:29:37,470
You son of a jerk.

3460
03:29:40,970 --> 03:29:41,910
You poopy hulk.

3461
03:29:43,990 --> 03:29:44,730
Yeah, let it.

3462
03:29:45,070 --> 03:29:46,450
I just ran right into that.

3463
03:30:18,110 --> 03:30:19,230
There we go.

3464
03:30:24,590 --> 03:30:25,250
Oh, no.

3465
03:30:35,300 --> 03:30:37,320
When I got shot, it...

3466
03:30:37,320 --> 03:30:40,520
Oh my gosh, the way it lands in his lap is so funny.

3467
03:30:41,120 --> 03:30:42,860
When I got shot, it made me drop my grenade.

3468
03:30:43,040 --> 03:30:44,120
That's so messed up.

3469
03:30:48,570 --> 03:30:49,790
Nope, that's the wrong way.

3470
03:30:52,290 --> 03:30:53,590
That's the wrong way.

3471
03:30:55,210 --> 03:30:55,250
Ah.

3472
03:30:56,650 --> 03:30:58,590
Nah, nah, nah, waiting for my help.

3473
03:31:00,270 --> 03:31:01,870
Don't shoot me, please.

3474
03:31:05,190 --> 03:31:07,270
This is so...

3475
03:31:07,870 --> 03:31:08,150
Oh!

3476
03:31:08,690 --> 03:31:09,110
No!

3477
03:31:11,590 --> 03:31:13,070
Gotta fix my contact.

3478
03:31:16,810 --> 03:31:17,770
Thank you, Earl.

3479
03:31:18,930 --> 03:31:21,430
The voice is the same as Robin from Teen Titans.

3480
03:31:21,590 --> 03:31:22,070
No way!

3481
03:31:23,810 --> 03:31:24,290
Really?

3482
03:31:37,600 --> 03:31:39,060
Oh my god, he's gonna rip!

3483
03:31:49,630 --> 03:31:52,230
Oh, no, no, no, get up, get up, get up, get up!

3484
03:31:52,230 --> 03:31:57,330
Why did you turn around?

3485
03:32:02,270 --> 03:32:03,390
This is...

3486
03:32:03,390 --> 03:32:04,630
I missoscelot fight.

3487
03:32:08,030 --> 03:32:10,650
The way it lands in his lap.

3488
03:32:12,870 --> 03:32:15,630
He's down, but also so are we, basically.

3489
03:32:15,870 --> 03:32:17,790
We are so not looking good.

3490
03:32:18,570 --> 03:32:19,890
Why are there...

3491
03:32:19,890 --> 03:32:21,330
It does sound like Robin!

3492
03:32:21,690 --> 03:32:22,710
It is Robin!

3493
03:32:30,040 --> 03:32:30,680
Um...

3494
03:32:42,970 --> 03:32:44,370
Still got two rations.

3495
03:32:46,870 --> 03:32:48,150
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

3496
03:32:48,150 --> 03:32:49,130
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

3497
03:32:49,350 --> 03:32:49,830
It's okay, though.

3498
03:32:50,330 --> 03:32:50,930
It's okay, though.

3499
03:32:56,950 --> 03:32:57,630
Oh, no, no, no, no.

3500
03:32:57,730 --> 03:32:58,050
I dropped it.

3501
03:32:58,130 --> 03:32:58,650
I dropped it.

3502
03:33:04,640 --> 03:33:05,020
Shoot.

3503
03:33:05,320 --> 03:33:05,720
Shoot.

3504
03:33:06,100 --> 03:33:06,540
This way.

3505
03:33:12,120 --> 03:33:13,220
Don't run over me.

3506
03:33:13,860 --> 03:33:15,580
Why is this fight so stupid?

3507
03:33:16,180 --> 03:33:17,940
Please, Snake, just throw it in there.

3508
03:33:20,360 --> 03:33:20,760
No!

3509
03:33:22,860 --> 03:33:23,760
There we go.

3510
03:33:24,260 --> 03:33:25,160
Yes, yes, yes.

3511
03:33:25,260 --> 03:33:26,440
Run, run, run, run, run, run.

3512
03:33:26,620 --> 03:33:27,720
Run, run, run, run.

3513
03:33:28,240 --> 03:33:28,280
Run, run, run.

3514
03:33:28,280 --> 03:33:28,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3515
03:33:29,160 --> 03:33:29,660
There we go.

3516
03:33:29,980 --> 03:33:31,060
I'm gonna, I'm gonna die.

3517
03:33:31,320 --> 03:33:31,820
I'm gonna...

3518
03:33:31,820 --> 03:33:32,220
Oh no!

3519
03:33:33,420 --> 03:33:35,420
I dropped the grenade again.

3520
03:33:36,680 --> 03:33:37,820
Let's go get some more.

3521
03:33:43,430 --> 03:33:43,890
Um...

3522
03:33:43,890 --> 03:33:45,130
More grenade, please.

3523
03:33:46,610 --> 03:33:47,350
Thank you.

3524
03:33:48,050 --> 03:33:50,790
Where are you?

3525
03:33:52,370 --> 03:33:52,830
Where's...

3526
03:33:52,830 --> 03:33:54,750
You think it would be easier finding a tank?

3527
03:33:55,490 --> 03:33:55,790
Oh!

3528
03:33:56,790 --> 03:33:57,250
Golly!

3529
03:33:57,370 --> 03:33:58,730
Whoa, Moli!

3530
03:34:00,790 --> 03:34:01,910
And shoot!

3531
03:34:03,370 --> 03:34:04,230
Oh my god.

3532
03:34:04,850 --> 03:34:06,370
Oh, this hurts so much.

3533
03:34:06,950 --> 03:34:07,790
No, what?

3534
03:34:08,270 --> 03:34:09,130
That didn't get in him?

3535
03:34:13,210 --> 03:34:15,150
Someone said to crawl in here.

3536
03:34:15,890 --> 03:34:16,730
What happens if I do?

3537
03:34:16,890 --> 03:34:18,670
Is there another...

3538
03:34:19,430 --> 03:34:20,990
There's just ammo in here.

3539
03:34:21,250 --> 03:34:22,950
There's no...

3540
03:34:24,870 --> 03:34:25,930
There's no...

3541
03:34:25,930 --> 03:34:27,630
There's no ration in here.

3542
03:34:32,120 --> 03:34:34,600
There's only ammo in here.

3543
03:34:37,760 --> 03:34:41,140
You're not supposed to get run over by the tank.

3544
03:34:51,430 --> 03:34:53,010
Oh, oh, ah.

3545
03:34:57,970 --> 03:35:00,430
Aren't you supposed to run out of bullets at some point?

3546
03:35:02,940 --> 03:35:04,380
I pressed A.

3547
03:35:04,820 --> 03:35:05,120
Please.

3548
03:35:05,840 --> 03:35:06,020
Ha!

3549
03:35:11,090 --> 03:35:12,770
Why didn't that work?

3550
03:35:13,470 --> 03:35:15,190
No, Snake, please.

3551
03:35:16,150 --> 03:35:17,550
Why didn't that work?

3552
03:35:23,640 --> 03:35:24,240
Why?!

3553
03:35:33,390 --> 03:35:35,230
What are these cutscenes?

3554
03:35:35,730 --> 03:35:37,010
Snake, answer me!

3555
03:35:37,470 --> 03:35:39,670
What are these cutscenes that are killing me?

3556
03:35:39,750 --> 03:35:40,210
Snake!

3557
03:35:41,390 --> 03:35:42,450
I don't understand!

3558
03:35:43,230 --> 03:35:46,910
I keep thinking that the cutscene means that it's like
hitting him, but it's not!

3559
03:35:47,670 --> 03:35:48,870
I don't understand!

3560
03:35:50,330 --> 03:35:52,470
Oh my goodness!

3561
03:35:59,210 --> 03:36:10,490
I wish there was some more does the stun grenade help so
much I see that they're suggesting it why don't they give

3562
03:36:10,490 --> 03:36:34,580
any rations though the game says get good truly the game
just says get good loser oh oh I hate this I I why do you

3563
03:36:34,660 --> 03:36:35,720
Show me that.

3564
03:36:42,370 --> 03:36:44,570
He's, oh, there it is, there it is, there it is.

3565
03:36:44,950 --> 03:36:45,710
In his little lap.

3566
03:36:49,130 --> 03:36:51,130
But it showed it in his lap.

3567
03:37:06,230 --> 03:37:07,190
Get up.

3568
03:37:09,630 --> 03:37:12,010
Or just get hit immediately again.

3569
03:37:12,210 --> 03:37:12,810
That's okay too.

3570
03:37:14,670 --> 03:37:15,150
Shoot!

3571
03:37:17,610 --> 03:37:18,090
Shoot!

3572
03:37:19,570 --> 03:37:20,870
Right there, no!

3573
03:37:22,890 --> 03:37:23,330
Oh!

3574
03:37:23,650 --> 03:37:24,990
Now it worked!

3575
03:37:25,510 --> 03:37:25,550
Yay!

3576
03:37:39,230 --> 03:37:40,870
Why are you saying mint?

3577
03:37:41,050 --> 03:37:41,750
Dot dot dot!

3578
03:37:41,930 --> 03:37:42,590
What do you mean?

3579
03:37:43,990 --> 03:37:47,970
The cutscene you keep seeing is when a grenade destroys a
tank tread.

3580
03:37:48,670 --> 03:37:49,110
Ah!

3581
03:37:51,010 --> 03:37:52,890
There's so many ways to do this, but she's stubborn.

3582
03:37:53,090 --> 03:37:57,830
Hey, this is the way that I've always done, you know?

3583
03:37:59,030 --> 03:38:00,690
And yeah, I am stubborn.

3584
03:38:00,810 --> 03:38:01,370
What of it?

3585
03:38:05,110 --> 03:38:05,590

3586
03:38:11,250 --> 03:38:17,790
oh he's doing sick wheelies okay get up get out

3587
03:38:25,210 --> 03:38:32,890

there's oh my god no please oh but okay okay I see it I get

3588
03:38:32,890 --> 03:38:41,910

3589
03:38:46,540 --> 03:38:49,360
what Where did that come from?!

3590
03:38:51,260 --> 03:38:52,940
It just completely rolled!

3591
03:38:55,520 --> 03:38:55,620
Oh.

3592
03:38:58,940 --> 03:39:00,060
Punch the tank.

3593
03:39:00,900 --> 03:39:02,160
Okay, I'll punch the tank.

3594
03:39:12,770 --> 03:39:18,150
I did so well every time I fought this dang thing in the
original.

3595
03:39:18,950 --> 03:39:19,790
I truly...

3596
03:39:19,790 --> 03:39:20,310
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3597
03:39:21,490 --> 03:39:23,350
I'm only gonna... I'm just gonna say...

3598
03:39:24,710 --> 03:39:28,270
I'm gonna... I'm gonna chalk it up to performance anxiety.

3599
03:39:28,350 --> 03:39:29,650
That's all I can say.

3600
03:39:30,810 --> 03:39:34,510
That's all I can, you know, I can believe in what really...

3601
03:39:34,510 --> 03:39:35,430
Oh my god.

3602
03:39:38,160 --> 03:39:42,200
Maybe because I'm playing it the way that I have been in...

3603
03:39:43,400 --> 03:39:43,980
What's it called?

3604
03:39:44,140 --> 03:39:44,680
In the original?

3605
03:39:44,980 --> 03:39:48,380
But, like, this is still so similar, so it's, you know.

3606
03:39:57,990 --> 03:39:58,930
Just CQC it.

3607
03:39:58,930 --> 03:39:59,810
Does that actually work?

3608
03:39:59,910 --> 03:40:01,310
I can't tell if you guys are trolling me.

3609
03:40:06,870 --> 03:40:07,550
Where'd you go?

3610
03:40:25,130 --> 03:40:26,370
Right in his lap.

3611
03:40:27,510 --> 03:40:28,670
I like Santa Claus.

3612
03:40:29,430 --> 03:40:30,650
We're only on Gunner 1.

3613
03:40:32,510 --> 03:40:33,950
Oh gosh, oh gosh.

3614
03:40:34,150 --> 03:40:34,530
Oh gosh.

3615
03:40:35,050 --> 03:40:38,850
Round 2.

3616
03:40:50,420 --> 03:40:51,240
Come on, Gunner 2.

3617
03:40:52,460 --> 03:40:53,140
Thanks, Robin.

3618
03:41:08,990 --> 03:41:10,790
That did big damage.

3619
03:41:18,380 --> 03:41:19,080
I might get the...

3620
03:41:19,600 --> 03:41:20,120
No.

3621
03:41:30,070 --> 03:41:30,490
Nice.

3622
03:41:35,130 --> 03:41:36,550
Can you move?

3623
03:41:38,470 --> 03:41:42,350
Stop capping me, my hands are obsessed with me.

3624
03:41:43,810 --> 03:41:45,390
Stop capping me.

3625
03:41:45,530 --> 03:41:46,090
Okay, we're going.

3626
03:41:46,570 --> 03:41:47,150
Uh, up, up, up.

3627
03:41:47,690 --> 03:41:48,190
Go, go, go.

3628
03:41:48,790 --> 03:41:49,450
Run, run, run.

3629
03:41:51,570 --> 03:41:53,110
Oh, I only have four grenades left.

3630
03:41:53,910 --> 03:41:54,130

3634
03:42:21,450 --> 03:42:22,630

I'll punch the tank.

3641
03:43:21,180 --> 03:43:22,240
You guys want me to punch the tank.

3642
03:43:22,360 --> 03:43:26,100
I'll go punch the tank CQC to flip the tank.

3643
03:43:26,900 --> 03:43:28,540
I would believe it in this game truly

3644
03:43:40,380 --> 03:43:43,360
He's so oh my god, he's aiming right at me.

3645
03:43:44,020 --> 03:43:44,760
It's so funny.

It didn't work!

3649
03:44:06,920 --> 03:44:08,560
Hold on, my chat froze.

3650
03:44:09,840 --> 03:44:11,180
Oh, my tap just crashed.

3651
03:44:12,160 --> 03:44:13,460
No, I'll just do this.

3652
03:44:13,980 --> 03:44:14,600
Give me a second.

3653
03:44:15,680 --> 03:44:16,680
I almost died!

3654
03:44:17,820 --> 03:44:20,260
You guys, how could you lie to me?

3655
03:44:21,480 --> 03:44:22,960
How could you do that?

3656
03:44:23,940 --> 03:44:25,260
How could you lie to me?

3657
03:44:26,680 --> 03:44:28,720
You see QC in the chat instead?

3658
03:44:29,100 --> 03:44:29,920
Okay, I think we're good.

3659
03:44:33,020 --> 03:44:34,180
Where is he?

3660
03:44:34,360 --> 03:44:35,720

03:44:41,400 --> 03:44:41,900
Don't camp me.

3667
03:44:42,680 --> 03:44:43,820
Let me get out of here first.

3668
03:44:48,810 --> 03:44:49,970
Okay, we're so close.

3669
03:44:50,090 --> 03:44:51,210
We just got to do it.

3670
03:44:52,210 --> 03:44:53,430
We just got to beat him.

3671
03:44:53,970 --> 03:44:54,850
Up and away.

3672
03:45:09,570 --> 03:45:10,510
I'm sorry you're wrong.

3673
03:45:12,650 --> 03:45:17,530
Why are you...

3674
03:45:18,110 --> 03:45:19,450
It's gonna explode, Snake!

3675
03:45:19,610 --> 03:45:20,550
It's gonna explode!

3676
03:45:21,590 --> 03:45:28,070
No way, he's walking.

3677
03:45:31,990 --> 03:45:32,570
Yo!

3678
03:45:49,210 --> 03:45:51,250
Oh my god, what a dummy.

3679
03:45:54,210 --> 03:45:55,030
Oh, nice.

3680
03:45:56,030 --> 03:45:56,370
Number three.

3681
03:45:58,930 --> 03:45:58,950
Wow.

3682
03:46:00,690 --> 03:46:01,290
Wow.

3683
03:46:02,870 --> 03:46:05,270
Wait, Vulcan Raven- Boss, is this all right?

3684
03:46:05,670 --> 03:46:07,750
Just giving him the card like that.

3685
03:46:13,290 --> 03:46:15,610
How are you still alive?

3686
03:46:15,870 --> 03:46:18,010
You would be wise not to underestimate him.

3687
03:46:19,050 --> 03:46:20,070
What did you think of him?

3688
03:46:21,250 --> 03:46:22,990
He is just as you said.

3689
03:46:23,130 --> 03:46:23,950
A buffoon.

3690
03:46:25,450 --> 03:46:27,310
He lives and breathes combat.

3691
03:46:27,410 --> 03:46:30,870
Just like you, I would expect no less from your...

3692
03:46:30,870 --> 03:46:35,530
You see, I told you so, but I will kill him.

3693
03:46:35,690 --> 03:46:36,510
From your what?

3694
03:46:36,690 --> 03:46:40,990
General Ivan, I hear that you lost your arm and ran away
home.

3695
03:46:41,890 --> 03:46:43,210
Watch your tongue, Shaman.

3696
03:46:43,770 --> 03:46:44,370
Thank you!

3697
03:46:44,570 --> 03:46:47,690
In the language of the Sioux people, Sioux means snake.

3698
03:46:47,790 --> 03:46:48,190
Snake.

3699
03:46:48,250 --> 03:46:50,470
It is known as an animal to be feared.

3700
03:46:51,990 --> 03:46:53,750
Well, snake is mine now.

3701
03:46:54,450 --> 03:46:57,390
When I meet him next, I'll take special...

3702
03:46:57,410 --> 03:47:14,250
kill him oh yes you will oh never mind he and i will meet
again in battle yes we will yes the raven on my head it

3703
03:47:14,250 --> 03:47:16,090
thirsts for his blood

3704
03:47:20,450 --> 03:47:27,970
oh yeah i love hulk and raven he's so cool God.

3705
03:47:33,410 --> 03:47:34,510
Wait, can I go back out?

3706
03:47:34,950 --> 03:47:37,390
I kind of want to get some more stuff.

3707
03:47:37,610 --> 03:47:38,730
Wait, are the cameras going to be here, though?

3708
03:47:39,790 --> 03:47:40,470
Actually, I don't remember.

3709
03:47:41,970 --> 03:47:43,110
When did the camera show up?

3710
03:47:44,650 --> 03:47:47,370
Not quite yet.

3711
03:47:47,610 --> 03:47:47,750
Cool.

3712
03:47:48,850 --> 03:47:49,970
But, are there mines?

3713
03:47:50,110 --> 03:47:50,950
I don't think so.

3714
03:47:53,810 --> 03:47:54,170
Grenade.

3715
03:47:56,670 --> 03:47:57,390
Anything out?

3716
03:47:57,410 --> 03:48:01,750
That guy didn't even leave anything either.

3717
03:48:03,790 --> 03:48:04,350
Chaffs.

3718
03:48:05,470 --> 03:48:09,410
Which we will need lots and lots of later on.

3719
03:48:11,250 --> 03:48:11,270
Oh!

3720
03:48:11,490 --> 03:48:12,270
This is all back too.

3721
03:48:12,910 --> 03:48:12,910
Nice.

3722
03:48:13,610 --> 03:48:14,170
Grenade.

3723
03:48:15,230 --> 03:48:17,530
Doesn't hurt to stock back up on some things.

3724
03:48:17,810 --> 03:48:17,910
Right!

3725
03:48:18,630 --> 03:48:20,350
Is there anything under the tank?

3726
03:48:24,790 --> 03:48:26,370
Can we even go under the tank?

3727
03:48:27,110 --> 03:48:27,670
Spin!

3728
03:48:28,470 --> 03:48:28,770
Nope.

3729
03:48:36,110 --> 03:48:37,490
I need goodies.

3730
03:48:39,030 --> 03:48:40,250
Things for me to collect.

3731
03:48:42,510 --> 03:48:43,910
Anything that I missed out on?

3732
03:48:45,010 --> 03:48:45,990
I don't think so.

3733
03:48:47,030 --> 03:48:49,330
Mei Ling would tell me that I am a fool right now.

3734
03:48:49,590 --> 03:48:49,710
Oh!

3735
03:48:52,390 --> 03:48:53,890
Was that there the whole time?

3736
03:48:55,910 --> 03:48:57,970
But I did so well in that last one.

3737
03:48:58,090 --> 03:48:59,010
We have five out of five.

3738
03:48:59,350 --> 03:49:00,190
I didn't even use any.

3739
03:49:00,590 --> 03:49:03,190
So take that game.

3740
03:49:03,210 --> 03:49:03,430
him.

3741
03:49:05,290 --> 03:49:06,210
Speaking of, mailing.

3742
03:49:06,990 --> 03:49:07,590
Let's save.

3743
03:49:09,090 --> 03:49:10,450
Who is it, Snake?

3744
03:49:11,810 --> 03:49:12,130
Save.

3745
03:49:13,730 --> 03:49:14,350
Thank you!

3746
03:49:15,030 --> 03:49:20,530
Just giving him the card like that, implying Robin flying
out to the tank and landing in front of Snake was plaid.

3747
03:49:20,770 --> 03:49:21,830
I don't know.

3748
03:49:23,090 --> 03:49:23,610
Right?

3749
03:49:23,950 --> 03:49:24,930
We'll save complete.

3750
03:49:25,070 --> 03:49:25,290
There we go.

3751
03:49:28,110 --> 03:49:32,670
Snake, have you ever heard this saying, friendly counsel
cuts off many foes?

3752
03:49:32,790 --> 03:49:33,050
No.

3753
03:49:33,210 --> 03:49:36,770
It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save
you a lot of trouble.

3754
03:49:37,750 --> 03:49:38,790
You should think about it.

3755
03:49:39,430 --> 03:49:44,990
If you're in trouble or if you need some information about
something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else,

3756
03:49:45,250 --> 03:49:45,510
okay?

3757
03:49:46,490 --> 03:49:47,570
Yeah, thank you.

3758
03:49:47,670 --> 03:49:48,910
Oh, okay.

3759
03:49:50,370 --> 03:49:52,330
That is so, oh my gosh, it's so true.

3760
03:49:52,750 --> 03:49:53,430
Last night, I don't know.

3761
03:49:54,090 --> 03:49:55,910
Like recently, well, I don't know.

3762
03:49:56,010 --> 03:50:01,310
Ever since I came back, I've been feeling like kind of a
little overwhelmed.

3763
03:50:01,430 --> 03:50:03,190
I feel like I'm kind of like a little...

3764
03:50:05,830 --> 03:50:15,010

don't know i don't know i don't know what i'm doing

3765
03:50:15,010 --> 03:50:26,250

03:53:06,610 --> 03:53:07,050
No!

3782
03:53:07,930 --> 03:53:13,370
I was gonna say we can use our M9, but we can't use that in
either.

3783
03:53:15,850 --> 03:53:17,290
Okay, never mind.

3784
03:53:17,950 --> 03:53:23,530
The game, before it lets you at least try, but now it's
like, um, don't even think about it.

3785
03:53:24,690 --> 03:53:25,130
Missy.

3786
03:53:32,910 --> 03:53:33,990
Trying on hearing your plays.

3787
03:53:34,130 --> 03:53:34,670
Good for the soul.

3788
03:53:35,150 --> 03:53:36,070
You're doing so well, keep it up.

3789
03:53:36,470 --> 03:53:37,270
Thanks, Conqueror.

3790
03:53:37,730 --> 03:53:39,110
I'm not doing that well, but it's okay.

3791
03:53:39,210 --> 03:53:39,430
I'm having fun.

3792
03:53:41,970 --> 03:53:43,290
What are you talking about?

3793
03:53:43,430 --> 03:53:44,070
It is interesting.

3794
03:53:44,450 --> 03:53:46,530
Oh, that's where they keep the nuclear warheads.

3795
03:53:47,010 --> 03:53:47,790
Can't you see them?

3796
03:53:48,230 --> 03:53:48,710
No, I'm...

3797
03:53:49,170 --> 03:53:51,770
Yeah, there's lots of boxes piled up in here, but...

3798
03:53:51,770 --> 03:53:53,550
Why are there just warheads in boxes?

3799
03:53:54,430 --> 03:53:55,990
They're all dismantled warheads.

3800
03:53:56,710 --> 03:53:57,930
They just leave them here?

3801
03:53:58,090 --> 03:53:58,410
Yeah!

3802
03:53:58,650 --> 03:54:00,050
It's like President Baker said.

3803
03:54:00,410 --> 03:54:01,870
Totally careless.

3804
03:54:02,330 --> 03:54:03,570
They're working on a limited budget.

3805
03:54:04,250 --> 03:54:08,410
They try to put on a pretty face for the media, but this is
the grim reality of it.

3806
03:54:08,870 --> 03:54:10,870
Where are my tax dollars going to?

3807
03:54:12,290 --> 03:54:17,630
all of the warheads in those boxes have had their detonation
mechanisms removed so there's no fear of them exploding

3808
03:54:17,630 --> 03:54:24,430
thank you for the vibe gifted thank you they might leak
plutonium and that would be a serious problem oh snake never

3809
03:54:24,430 --> 03:54:33,230
use your weapon on that floor okay well it won't even let me
anyway so you can't catch me using my weapon on this floor

3810
03:54:33,230 --> 03:54:45,090
because I'm not allowed because the game what what do you
mean no use What do you mean no use?

3811
03:54:45,570 --> 03:54:46,410
It's a box!

3812
03:54:49,090 --> 03:54:50,950
Oh, because I'm crouched, I think.

3813
03:54:52,810 --> 03:54:56,050
Oh, I was about to say, you...

3814
03:54:57,470 --> 03:54:59,550
You can't do this to me.

3815
03:55:00,810 --> 03:55:01,150
Ah!

3816
03:55:05,360 --> 03:55:06,080
Huh?

3817
03:55:08,020 --> 03:55:09,300
Just a box.

3818
03:55:28,410 --> 03:55:29,690
Just a box.

3819
03:55:30,410 --> 03:55:31,970
He didn't even say anything to me though.

3820
03:55:32,350 --> 03:55:33,430
I'm kind of surprised.

3821
03:55:35,370 --> 03:55:36,970
I like how she says, you see those boxes?

3822
03:55:37,430 --> 03:55:38,190
Actually, I don't.

3823
03:55:41,510 --> 03:55:42,530
Actually, I don't see.

3824
03:55:46,670 --> 03:55:48,530
I need that guy up there to move.

3825
03:55:49,730 --> 03:55:52,030
I need that guy up there to leave.

3826
03:55:52,830 --> 03:55:53,350
Okay, there we go.

3827
03:55:55,890 --> 03:55:56,690
Oh, lockers.

3828
03:56:03,550 --> 03:56:05,910
Okay, um, I think we're not safe.

3829
03:56:25,190 --> 03:56:27,150
Okay, thank you.

3830
03:56:28,710 --> 03:56:29,390
That's fine.

3831
03:56:29,970 --> 03:56:30,950
This is fine.

3832
03:56:34,520 --> 03:56:35,940
Uh, yep, this is, okay.

3833
03:56:44,670 --> 03:56:45,190
Press the button.

3834
03:56:45,730 --> 03:56:46,230
Go, snake, go.

3835
03:56:46,890 --> 03:56:47,610
Go, snake, go.

3836
03:56:54,330 --> 03:56:54,770
Whoa!

3837
03:56:59,130 --> 03:56:59,610
B1.

3838
03:57:08,550 --> 03:57:10,670
That was pretty close, wasn't it?

3839
03:57:13,410 --> 03:57:15,750
This is not the right floor.

3840
03:57:19,110 --> 03:57:19,790
B2.

3841
03:57:23,910 --> 03:57:26,510
This is the right floor.

3842
03:57:26,630 --> 03:57:28,210
Oh my gosh, you can see him.

3843
03:57:36,190 --> 03:57:37,290
He's pacing.

3844
03:57:38,070 --> 03:57:38,990
He's a scientist.

3845
03:57:40,730 --> 03:57:41,330
You hear me?

3846
03:57:42,430 --> 03:57:43,090
You hear me?

3847
03:57:45,130 --> 03:57:48,010
Okay, this is where we discover the poison room.

3848
03:57:49,230 --> 03:57:50,770
Well, it doesn't look so gassy in there.

3849
03:57:51,630 --> 03:57:52,290
Actually, it looks fine.

3850
03:57:58,340 --> 03:57:59,960
Actually, it looks totally normal.

3851
03:58:03,020 --> 03:58:03,780
Oh, never mind.

3852
03:58:04,540 --> 03:58:05,260
Watch out, snake.

3853
03:58:09,610 --> 03:58:12,990
The, like, the levels of security here.

3854
03:58:13,730 --> 03:58:15,210
First, you gotta make it gassy.

3855
03:58:15,870 --> 03:58:16,970
Whoa, whoa.

3856
03:58:17,690 --> 03:58:19,290
Oh, yeah!

3857
03:58:20,870 --> 03:58:23,650
And then you also have to make it electrified.

3858
03:58:24,650 --> 03:58:26,450
It is overkill, absolutely.

3859
03:58:28,430 --> 03:58:28,610
Wait.

3860
03:58:29,550 --> 03:58:31,530
But, you know...

3861
03:58:31,530 --> 03:58:36,530
I guess it's not overkill because I get past it.

3862
03:58:42,840 --> 03:58:44,340
Snake, watch out.

3863
03:58:44,860 --> 03:58:46,560
That place is filled with gas.

3864
03:58:47,480 --> 03:58:49,000
Also, the floor is electrified.

3865
03:58:49,180 --> 03:58:49,920
Hey, it's filled with gas.

3866
03:58:50,220 --> 03:58:50,740
Also...

3867
03:58:50,760 --> 03:58:51,640
The floor will kill you.

3868
03:58:51,700 --> 03:58:52,500
I'll destroy the high voltage switch.

3869
03:58:53,180 --> 03:58:55,520
It's the switchboard on the northwest wall.

3870
03:58:55,640 --> 03:58:56,600
I'll destroy it.

3871
03:58:56,980 --> 03:58:57,940
I can't reach it.

3872
03:58:58,260 --> 03:59:00,020
Use a remote controlled missile.

3873
03:59:00,340 --> 03:59:00,620
Okay.

3874
03:59:01,440 --> 03:59:04,580
I'm gonna leave and go back.

3875
03:59:06,060 --> 03:59:06,500
Oh.

3876
03:59:06,880 --> 03:59:08,460
Going all the way here.

3877
03:59:09,120 --> 03:59:10,860
Then to go all the way back.

3878
03:59:11,800 --> 03:59:13,120
I'll come back for you, Otacon.

3879
03:59:14,240 --> 03:59:15,240
I'll come back for you.

3880
03:59:16,260 --> 03:59:17,500
Oh, for anyone curious?

3881
03:59:18,220 --> 03:59:20,680

Maybe it's B.

3892
04:01:08,230 --> 04:01:09,090
I don't know it.

3893
04:01:13,210 --> 04:01:13,650

Okay, we gotta wait for this guy to leave too, I think.

04:01:19,550 --> 04:01:20,450
Yeah, he's coming over.

3897
04:01:21,970 --> 04:01:22,890

We had it perfect.

3901
04:01:27,350 --> 04:01:28,570
If only I didn't mess it up.

3902
04:01:29,510 --> 04:01:30,210

3903
04:01:30,330 --> 04:01:30,770

No more, no less.

3913
04:02:56,230 --> 04:02:57,320
Does he look this way?

3914
04:03:05,750 --> 04:03:07,410
No, la la la.

3915
04:03:08,690 --> 04:03:10,030
Peep, peep, poop out.

3916
04:03:10,970 --> 04:03:11,910
M9 ammo.

3917
04:03:12,810 --> 04:03:13,950
Very good.

3918
04:03:16,130 --> 04:03:17,710
Which, can I...

3919
04:03:17,710 --> 04:03:18,270
Uh...

3920
04:03:20,790 --> 04:03:23,090
Uh, I don't think I can reach.

3921
04:03:26,990 --> 04:03:28,710
This guy's gonna come back.

3922
04:03:30,170 --> 04:03:30,790
Oh, wait.

3923
04:03:35,050 --> 04:03:39,590
Well, we want to get this guy over here first, because
otherwise he'll discover his sleeping friend.

3924
04:03:39,990 --> 04:03:43,250
Even though if he's sleeping right now, it's no biggie.

3925
04:03:44,590 --> 04:03:46,090
So calm to destroy the camera.

3926
04:03:47,410 --> 04:03:47,790
Yeah?

3927
04:03:47,990 --> 04:03:49,950
Oh, actually, that is a good point.

3928
04:03:51,170 --> 04:03:54,750
Once we... Is he coming, or does he not come?

3929
04:03:54,770 --> 04:04:09,970
this way actually I don't know let's just put this guy to
sleep the night little baby go to sleep little baby oh

3930
04:04:14,510 --> 04:04:23,680
oh there he is oh it's

3931
04:04:26,870 --> 04:04:38,110
fine are you dead oh cool I thought

3932
04:04:42,550 --> 04:04:52,090
it was gone I thought he was gone he was in fact still there

3933
04:05:04,630 --> 04:05:07,230
doesn't matter anyway because

3934
04:05:12,370 --> 04:05:15,490
Why would it- why did it go down so quickly before?

3935
04:05:16,470 --> 04:05:17,510
That's weird.

3936
04:05:18,350 --> 04:05:18,670
Hmm.

3937
04:05:20,990 --> 04:05:21,410
Oh god.

3938
04:05:25,990 --> 04:05:27,030
Now we...

3939
04:05:27,030 --> 04:05:27,750
Are these open?

3940
04:05:28,630 --> 04:05:29,370
Nothing here.

3941
04:05:32,770 --> 04:05:33,670
Can I shoot from here?

3942
04:05:34,630 --> 04:05:35,930
That'd be pretty handy if I could.

3943
04:05:37,750 --> 04:05:39,530
If I back up a little.

3944
04:05:41,450 --> 04:05:41,750
Oh!

3945
04:05:42,130 --> 04:05:42,390
Oh!

3946
04:05:43,550 --> 04:05:44,970
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

3947
04:05:47,170 --> 04:05:48,870
Can I get a little closer?

3948
04:05:50,450 --> 04:05:50,610
No.

3949
04:05:51,870 --> 04:05:53,070
Okay, right here.

3950
04:05:53,890 --> 04:05:54,110
No.

3951
04:05:55,050 --> 04:05:57,210
Okay, right here.

3952
04:05:58,670 --> 04:05:59,130
Alright.

3953
04:06:00,390 --> 04:06:02,370
Come over here.

3954
04:06:03,030 --> 04:06:06,250
Where I can see you.

3955
04:06:06,950 --> 04:06:08,610
Uh, gotta get your leg.

3956
04:06:14,620 --> 04:06:15,040
Mm-hmm.

3957
04:06:15,320 --> 04:06:16,200
Just a mosquito.

3958
04:06:17,800 --> 04:06:21,240
It happens way more often than you'd imagine.

3959
04:06:23,040 --> 04:06:27,360
Those pesky Alaskan mosquitoes, you guys, are so icky.

3960
04:06:28,460 --> 04:06:28,980
Did it work?

3961
04:06:29,300 --> 04:06:29,720
I think so.

3962
04:06:31,060 --> 04:06:31,200
Oh.

3963
04:06:34,920 --> 04:06:37,020
He technically did his report.

3964
04:06:37,800 --> 04:06:39,140
Oh, maybe he didn't.

3965
04:06:41,400 --> 04:06:42,120
Um.

3966
04:06:46,190 --> 04:06:47,350
Backup unit.

3967
04:06:48,670 --> 04:06:49,930
Oh, there they come.

3968
04:06:52,650 --> 04:07:03,690
we can get them too easy peasy one hit them with the old one
two and they will never oh I think they woke them up just

3969
04:07:03,690 --> 04:07:15,030
imagining things there's a mosquito it's a really awful
powerful one it sucks all your oh they're searching I think

3970
04:07:15,810 --> 04:07:21,630
nothing here nothing here nothing here Where?

3971
04:07:21,850 --> 04:07:23,010
I'm hearing so many footsteps.

3972
04:07:23,130 --> 04:07:26,130
Oh, I think I'm hearing them above me, maybe?

3973
04:07:26,890 --> 04:07:28,070
It sounds so close.

3974
04:07:29,770 --> 04:07:30,910
I can't believe there's the...

3975
04:07:30,910 --> 04:07:33,190
The one tanker's gone.

3976
04:07:33,310 --> 04:07:33,710
It's so funny.

3977
04:07:33,790 --> 04:07:34,750
Or the one tank is gone.

3978
04:07:35,470 --> 04:07:36,090
It's so funny.

3979
04:07:37,030 --> 04:07:37,850
Where am I going again?

3980
04:07:37,930 --> 04:07:38,550
Oh, the armory.

3981
04:07:38,710 --> 04:07:39,070
That's right.

3982
04:07:40,130 --> 04:07:41,050
Is that your leg?

3983
04:07:50,780 --> 04:07:52,320
Once he's down, we're going to leave.

3984
04:07:53,060 --> 04:07:54,480
Actually, I think I can leave now.

3985
04:07:54,960 --> 04:07:55,360
But...

3986
04:07:55,360 --> 04:07:57,040
We'll just be safe.

3987
04:07:59,100 --> 04:07:59,920
Go down.

3988
04:08:00,900 --> 04:08:03,100
Go to sleep.

3989
04:08:09,970 --> 04:08:10,730
Um...

3990
04:08:10,730 --> 04:08:11,250
Okay.

3991
04:08:11,730 --> 04:08:11,890
Hmm?

3992
04:08:13,750 --> 04:08:13,910
Hmm?

3993
04:08:14,410 --> 04:08:15,250
Is there somebody there?

3994
04:08:15,430 --> 04:08:15,610
No.

3995
04:08:16,410 --> 04:08:17,350
Nobody here.

3996
04:08:18,810 --> 04:08:19,050
Nobody.

3997
04:08:20,550 --> 04:08:21,970
Nothing here.

3998
04:08:29,390 --> 04:08:30,550
Oh, wait!

3999
04:08:30,670 --> 04:08:31,350
No, it's B2!

4000
04:08:31,810 --> 04:08:33,130
Ah, it's okay.

4001
04:08:35,390 --> 04:08:36,350
No word.

4002
04:08:37,290 --> 04:08:38,050
Actually...

4003
04:08:38,050 --> 04:08:39,170
It's fine.

4004
04:08:45,010 --> 04:08:46,210
Nothing here.

4005
04:08:47,490 --> 04:08:50,090
We need the Nikita missiles, right?

4006
04:08:55,830 --> 04:08:57,030
So stressful.

4007
04:08:59,710 --> 04:09:01,410
This guy's gonna come up and discover us.

4008
04:09:01,650 --> 04:09:02,170
I do know that.

4009
04:09:02,490 --> 04:09:04,570
So we need to act first.

4010
04:09:04,570 --> 04:09:07,680
We need to box it up.

4011
04:09:12,040 --> 04:09:12,640
Oh my god.

4012
04:09:14,720 --> 04:09:17,140
Is he gonna notice me or...

4013
04:09:17,140 --> 04:09:18,000
Am I in your way?

4014
04:09:18,760 --> 04:09:19,640
Oh, shoot.

4015
04:09:20,800 --> 04:09:23,220
Well, that just puts a little damper in our plans now.

4016
04:09:24,960 --> 04:09:25,960
Doesn't it?

4017
04:09:29,140 --> 04:09:29,640
Um...

4018
04:09:31,860 --> 04:09:32,700
Who's that?

4019
04:09:32,800 --> 04:09:34,540
Oh, you kicked me before I could grab you!

4020
04:09:35,580 --> 04:09:36,380
What is that?

4021
04:09:38,120 --> 04:09:39,000
Oh, come on.

4022
04:09:44,740 --> 04:09:45,640
It's okay, snake.

4023
04:09:46,220 --> 04:09:47,700
All we gotta do is get the Nikita and go.

4024
04:09:48,560 --> 04:09:49,120
It doesn't matter.

4025
04:09:50,200 --> 04:09:50,480
Oh, wait.

4026
04:09:50,580 --> 04:09:52,380
Actually, this might be a good place to hide.

4027
04:09:52,900 --> 04:09:53,100
Right?

4028
04:09:53,700 --> 04:09:57,020
Because we can just...

4029
04:10:17,210 --> 04:10:18,730
They don't like coming in here.

4030
04:10:19,630 --> 04:10:20,950
They don't like coming in here.

4031
04:10:21,130 --> 04:10:21,690
I've noticed.

4032
04:10:22,190 --> 04:10:23,510
So, uh...

4033
04:10:23,530 --> 04:10:25,330
Good stuff.

4034
04:10:25,750 --> 04:10:27,550
Okay, they are right where we need to go.

4035
04:10:27,750 --> 04:10:29,750
So you guys need to leave.

4036
04:10:30,490 --> 04:10:32,450
That's where the room is.

4037
04:10:37,090 --> 04:10:38,090
You're checking?

4038
04:10:40,490 --> 04:10:41,890
It's a spooky room.

4039
04:10:42,070 --> 04:10:42,630
It is.

4040
04:10:43,810 --> 04:10:45,710
I kind of wanted to hear the BDM one, though.

4041
04:10:46,370 --> 04:10:46,970
Kind of awesome.

4042
04:10:48,470 --> 04:10:49,730
You need to leave!

4043
04:10:52,170 --> 04:10:55,070
Actually, I think they do check in here, but...

4044
04:10:55,090 --> 04:10:57,990
We'll see if the radar goes down before they get it to this
place.

4045
04:11:00,330 --> 04:11:00,730
Yep.

4046
04:11:02,690 --> 04:11:03,090
Nice.

4047
04:11:04,450 --> 04:11:05,550
Nice, nice, nice.

4048
04:11:06,290 --> 04:11:11,130
That guy,

4049
04:11:15,450 --> 04:11:16,070
what are you doing?

4050
04:11:16,210 --> 04:11:16,810
You're going that way.

4051
04:11:27,170 --> 04:11:28,350
Get Nikita first.

4052
04:11:29,570 --> 04:11:30,550
Did he hear me in here?

4053
04:11:31,350 --> 04:11:31,750
Oh, shit.

4054
04:11:32,330 --> 04:11:33,070
Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah.

4055
04:11:34,730 --> 04:11:36,370
Where's the box?

4056
04:11:36,610 --> 04:11:36,810
Okay.

4057
04:11:38,290 --> 04:11:40,850
I think the door's still open.

4058
04:11:42,550 --> 04:11:43,490
Okay, no, we're good.

4059
04:11:44,570 --> 04:11:46,290
Is there a...

4060
04:11:48,070 --> 04:11:48,910
No...

4061
04:11:48,910 --> 04:11:49,530
No tricks.

4062
04:11:51,290 --> 04:11:52,010
No tricks.

4063
04:11:53,110 --> 04:11:53,330
Okay.

4064
04:11:54,250 --> 04:11:55,290
And what's in here?

4065
04:11:58,350 --> 04:12:00,030
What's this?

4066
04:12:02,910 --> 04:12:04,050
Eternal darkness?

4067
04:12:05,630 --> 04:12:06,030
Hello?

4068
04:12:07,050 --> 04:12:07,770
Okay.

4069
04:12:08,290 --> 04:12:09,130
Oh, okay.

4070
04:12:11,050 --> 04:12:15,350
All right, now we gotta go back all the way.

4071
04:12:16,190 --> 04:12:19,330
Let's wait for him to loop around again.

4072
04:12:20,750 --> 04:12:22,410
What if I leave a book?

4073
04:12:24,270 --> 04:12:26,150
Leave a sexy book for you to look at.

4074
04:12:26,550 --> 04:12:28,170
So you don't come back around.

4075
04:12:29,170 --> 04:12:30,250
How do I, how do I plan this?

4076
04:12:30,510 --> 04:12:31,490
Press A to set.

4077
04:12:32,350 --> 04:12:32,430
Okay.

4078
04:12:42,950 --> 04:12:43,970
Over there, you.

4079
04:12:45,030 --> 04:12:45,690
Thank you.

4080
04:12:56,220 --> 04:13:05,800

present you know now he won't come back okay let's go to

4081
04:13:05,800 --> 04:13:12,940
what i gave him a little present now we're we're buds now
we're buddies

4082
04:13:16,540 --> 04:13:21,380
do i i hear someone snoring i think

4083
04:13:26,280 --> 04:13:26,880
Um...

4084
04:13:26,880 --> 04:13:30,160
They turned off the lasers right here, this part.

4085
04:13:32,460 --> 04:13:32,760
Right?

4086
04:13:33,120 --> 04:13:34,360
Did they turn off the lasers here?

4087
04:13:38,640 --> 04:13:39,960
No, they didn't!

4088
04:13:40,760 --> 04:13:42,360
That's so evil!

4089
04:13:44,900 --> 04:13:45,940
Oh my god, um...

4090
04:13:45,940 --> 04:13:46,920
Dying!

4091
04:13:53,810 --> 04:13:55,530
Good to check.

4092
04:13:55,710 --> 04:13:57,150
When did they turn them off?

4093
04:13:58,430 --> 04:14:00,970
Colonel, can you do that for me?

4094
04:14:03,850 --> 04:14:07,290
It looks like the infrared sensors that were set up here had
been switched off.

4095
04:14:07,530 --> 04:14:08,050
Wait, what?

4096
04:14:18,500 --> 04:14:20,600
Am I willing to test it?

4097
04:14:22,360 --> 04:14:22,740
Am I...

4098
04:14:22,740 --> 04:14:25,440
Am I willing to test it?

4099
04:14:28,040 --> 04:14:28,520
Um...

4100
04:14:28,520 --> 04:14:28,900
Huh?

4101
04:14:31,260 --> 04:14:32,840
Why don't I trust that?

4102
04:14:36,880 --> 04:14:37,680
I don't...

4103
04:14:37,680 --> 04:14:38,500
I'm gonna try.

4104
04:14:39,440 --> 04:14:40,680
Because usually they are, right?

4105
04:14:40,800 --> 04:14:44,740
In my parents' homeland, they say, if there are more wolves,
the people are eaten.

4106
04:14:45,020 --> 04:14:45,080
Oh.

4107
04:14:45,220 --> 04:14:47,580
If there are more people, the wolves are eaten.

4108
04:14:47,920 --> 04:14:48,500
Who are eating?

4109
04:14:48,620 --> 04:14:48,920
Who is...

4110
04:14:48,920 --> 04:14:50,720
That means the side with greater numbers is usually the
winner.

4111
04:14:50,820 --> 04:14:51,640
Do people eat wolves?

4112
04:14:51,960 --> 04:14:52,760
You're sadly outnumbered snake.

4113
04:14:52,940 --> 04:14:54,100
Try not to let them see you.

4114
04:14:54,200 --> 04:14:54,520
I know.

4115
04:14:55,000 --> 04:14:55,680
I know, mailing.

4116
04:14:55,920 --> 04:14:56,080
I know.

4117
04:14:58,040 --> 04:14:58,840
Gaslight 100.

4118
04:15:02,400 --> 04:15:02,800
Um...

4119
04:15:03,880 --> 04:15:04,660
Oh my god.

4120
04:15:05,240 --> 04:15:05,960
I'm gonna run.

4121
04:15:23,310 --> 04:15:25,670
I've never seen this cutscene before, though.

4122
04:15:30,670 --> 04:15:31,270
Colonel.

4123
04:15:32,590 --> 04:15:33,190
Colonel!

4124
04:15:34,370 --> 04:15:36,090
Yo, this is so messed up.

4125
04:15:38,530 --> 04:15:39,130
I...

4126
04:15:39,130 --> 04:15:40,450
Get me out of here!

4127
04:15:44,930 --> 04:15:48,190
Might as well give one last read before I die.

4128
04:15:51,150 --> 04:15:52,170
Call him?

4129
04:15:52,690 --> 04:15:53,570
Yeah, for real.

4130
04:15:53,710 --> 04:15:55,030
Colonel, this is your fault.

4131
04:15:55,750 --> 04:15:57,490
Snake, it's gas.

4132
04:15:58,130 --> 04:15:58,730
Hold your breath.

4133
04:15:59,550 --> 04:16:00,190
Your O2 gauge.

4134
04:16:00,530 --> 04:16:01,090
Until when?

4135
04:16:02,610 --> 04:16:04,970
If you don't breathe, the gauge will decrease.

4136
04:16:05,870 --> 04:16:08,870
When it reaches zero, your life gauge will begin to
decrease.

4137
04:16:11,730 --> 04:16:12,550
No way.

4138
04:16:12,610 --> 04:16:14,090
He just told me to hold my breath.

4139
04:16:18,230 --> 04:16:18,790
Meryl.

4140
04:16:18,930 --> 04:16:19,470
Deep throat.

4141
04:16:19,870 --> 04:16:22,230
No, that's not what I'm asking you.

4142
04:16:22,870 --> 04:16:23,390
I see.

4143
04:16:24,030 --> 04:16:24,850
Master Miller.

4144
04:16:25,130 --> 04:16:25,950
He's trying to help you.

4145
04:16:26,070 --> 04:16:26,730
Master Miller.

4146
04:16:27,470 --> 04:16:33,440
here a trap could be but for the time being i'll have to
trust him

4147
04:16:37,970 --> 04:16:47,430
here's to almost two weeks of min's return of mgs stream
develop a kind of sixth sense to warn them of danger trust

4148
04:16:47,430 --> 04:16:57,090
your instincts as a soldier as a gamer i love that line so
much um well i guess it's a good thing i saved i i don't

4149
04:16:57,090 --> 04:17:11,370
know what a joke what a joke the game told me the sensors
were off the game told me the sensors were off that's so

4150
04:17:11,370 --> 04:17:20,670
messed up oh thank goodness okay I wonder though okay hold
on hold on I'm not even gonna look let's let's try calling

4151
04:17:20,670 --> 04:17:32,930
Colonel again it looks like the infrared sensors that were
set up here have been switched off yes oh my god I'm so

4152
04:17:32,930 --> 04:17:50,310
scared no they have not been turned off colonel is actually
he is actively sabotaging me oh my god oh he is actively

4153
04:17:50,310 --> 04:17:55,730
sabotaging me welcome back mint been a while but I kept up
Thank you so much!

4154
04:17:58,950 --> 04:17:59,510
Okay.

4155
04:17:59,810 --> 04:18:01,370
Oh, dang it, I missed it.

4156
04:18:02,390 --> 04:18:02,470
I

4157
04:18:10,270 --> 04:18:11,790
think the game is a little bugged.

4158
04:18:18,370 --> 04:18:18,930
Respond!

4159
04:18:23,290 --> 04:18:24,690
This is messed up.

4160
04:18:25,510 --> 04:18:26,910
I think the game is a little bugged.

4161
04:18:39,070 --> 04:18:42,270
Is it because I took the... oh.

4162
04:18:43,590 --> 04:18:45,090
The heliport way?

4163
04:18:46,330 --> 04:18:48,170
Would that affect it?

4164
04:19:00,620 --> 04:19:01,180
Fushigi.

4165
04:19:02,540 --> 04:19:03,900
Just a game doing a little trolling.

4166
04:19:09,740 --> 04:19:15,880
Yeah, because there's also not the cameras set up here and
stuff, so...

4167
04:19:15,880 --> 04:19:16,240
Interesting.

4168
04:19:19,660 --> 04:19:23,740
I think... Actually, I am gonna use this and we're gonna
grab the ration that's up here.

4169
04:19:28,700 --> 04:19:31,300
Colonel's misleading me more than chat does.

4170
04:19:34,720 --> 04:19:39,660
Colonel is really trying to make me throw.

4171
04:19:48,490 --> 04:19:48,770
Oh.

4172
04:19:49,850 --> 04:19:50,250
Oh.

4173
04:19:52,970 --> 04:19:54,810
Actually, this is a good opportunity.

4174
04:20:01,110 --> 04:20:01,890
Uh, box.

4175
04:20:02,710 --> 04:20:02,990
Oh, wait.

4176
04:20:03,270 --> 04:20:03,610
Get up.

4177
04:20:04,110 --> 04:20:04,950
And box.

4178
04:20:05,950 --> 04:20:23,290
and over here over over here my little safety net my little
safety spot can I see up there I kind of can oh there he is

4179
04:20:23,290 --> 04:20:32,890
okay okay I don't know we do know that we can box in front
of the whoa we can box in front of the elevator though so

4180
04:20:32,890 --> 04:20:35,530
hopefully as long as I align it right I guess.

4181
04:20:44,990 --> 04:20:46,050
Does he stop there?

4182
04:20:46,470 --> 04:20:48,430
Yes, he does, but I can go.

4183
04:20:55,190 --> 04:20:56,070
Thank you.

4184
04:20:57,970 --> 04:20:58,930
Okay, we gotta hurry.

4185
04:20:59,290 --> 04:21:00,410
We gotta go, go, go, go, go.

4186
04:21:02,450 --> 04:21:03,310
Oh my god, please.

4187
04:21:03,510 --> 04:21:04,410
Snake, press the button.

4188
04:21:04,790 --> 04:21:05,470
Oh, press the button.

4189
04:21:09,490 --> 04:21:10,370
Oh, holy.

4190
04:21:15,010 --> 04:21:15,890
Holy cow!

4191
04:21:17,110 --> 04:21:17,850
That was close.

4192
04:21:19,470 --> 04:21:19,910
B2.

4193
04:21:24,390 --> 04:21:28,030
Nothing I see here, nothing to see here.

4194
04:21:29,050 --> 04:21:29,870
All good.

4195
04:21:32,710 --> 04:21:34,470
It is the Nikita missiles that I need.

4196
04:21:34,690 --> 04:21:34,850
Wait.

4197
04:21:36,130 --> 04:21:36,370
Okay.

4198
04:21:37,330 --> 04:21:41,130
Oh, I was about to say, what if I don't even have them?

4199
04:21:42,010 --> 04:21:44,570
Okay, Snake, we're gonna need you to hold your breath,
buddy.

4200
04:21:46,790 --> 04:21:54,970
It's my first time trying this in this game, so it's gonna
be interesting, to say the least.

4201
04:21:55,670 --> 04:21:56,570
Might take a couple tries.

4202
04:21:56,710 --> 04:21:57,790
Okay, how do I use this?

4203
04:21:59,310 --> 04:22:03,450
A button to aim in first-person view, release the fire, and
control.

4204
04:22:04,530 --> 04:22:04,830
Choo!

4205
04:22:05,290 --> 04:22:06,290
If you know...

4206
04:22:06,290 --> 04:22:07,910
Wait, wait, what are you saying?

4207
04:22:08,590 --> 04:22:10,470

Oh, wait.

4210
04:22:15,610 --> 04:22:17,810
Twin snakes is a ride in VR mission.

4211
04:22:17,970 --> 04:22:20,770
The kernel telling you sensors are off might be a glitch in
the matrix.

4212
04:22:23,030 --> 04:22:23,490
Mysterious.

4213
04:22:23,970 --> 04:22:24,510
Welcome back, Mint.

4214
04:22:24,610 --> 04:22:26,430
Metal Gear, Brain Rot is forever.

04:22:32,530 --> 04:22:34,970
You have 40 shots, so go for it.

4216
04:22:35,070 --> 04:22:35,250
True.

4217
04:22:35,750 --> 04:22:36,350
Okay, here we go.

4218
04:22:38,070 --> 04:22:39,590
A and release!

4219
04:22:42,450 --> 04:22:43,370
Okay, turns.

4220
04:22:44,090 --> 04:22:44,370
Ah!

4221
04:22:46,170 --> 04:22:48,090
Okay, and nice and neat.

4222
04:22:48,170 --> 04:22:48,330
Ah!

4223
04:22:49,330 --> 04:22:50,470
Go, go, go, go, go!

4224
04:22:51,090 --> 04:22:51,970
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!

4225
04:22:53,050 --> 04:22:55,930
Don't shoot it down, don't shoot it down.

4226
04:23:06,940 --> 04:23:08,540
I think I'm a gamer.

4227
04:23:12,310 --> 04:23:13,210
I think I'm a gamer.

4228
04:23:19,010 --> 04:23:20,710
Nice, nice, nice.

4229
04:23:20,890 --> 04:23:23,190
Now which one has the gas mask?

4230
04:23:23,830 --> 04:23:26,710
in it, uh, this one?

4231
04:23:27,390 --> 04:23:29,990
No, this one.

4232
04:23:30,230 --> 04:23:31,310
That's a dirty magazine.

4233
04:23:32,130 --> 04:23:34,390
Wait, a chaff grenade.

4234
04:23:34,610 --> 04:23:35,430
I'm just gonna chaff it.

4235
04:23:37,090 --> 04:23:38,410
I know I probably shouldn't, but.

4236
04:23:40,090 --> 04:23:41,150
Okay, we gotta hurry.

4237
04:23:41,390 --> 04:23:41,790
Come on.

4238
04:23:43,830 --> 04:23:44,770
It's one of these.

4239
04:23:45,230 --> 04:23:46,470
Let's go, go, go, go, go, go.

4240
04:23:46,530 --> 04:23:47,230
Grab the book.

4241
04:23:47,730 --> 04:23:48,430
Grab the mask.

4242
04:23:48,810 --> 04:23:49,490
Put on the mask.

4243
04:23:52,790 --> 04:23:53,810
Can I get in this one?

4244
04:23:53,830 --> 04:23:54,750
while it's still jammed?

4245
04:23:55,270 --> 04:23:57,290
Oh, I can't, I could have, I could have, but it's okay.

4246
04:24:00,330 --> 04:24:01,050
Okay, nice.

4247
04:24:04,830 --> 04:24:06,950
Oh my gosh, we got that ride and vision real.

4248
04:24:07,890 --> 04:24:09,370
Is there a, oh no, there's nothing in here.

4249
04:24:10,710 --> 04:24:12,970
Oh wait, there's actually nothing in here.

4250
04:24:13,270 --> 04:24:14,550
Okay, there's a node.

4251
04:24:21,990 --> 04:24:29,490
Bam, I don't remember if there's anything over here that I
can get, but we'll try.

4252
04:24:30,410 --> 04:24:33,510
I don't have much oxygen left.

4253
04:24:33,690 --> 04:24:34,510
Come on, let's go.

4254
04:24:34,830 --> 04:24:35,750
Nope, not that one.

4255
04:24:36,570 --> 04:24:37,530
Yep, this one.

4256
04:24:38,390 --> 04:24:39,190
Grenade chaff?

4257
04:24:39,850 --> 04:24:40,410
Grenade full?

4258
04:24:41,430 --> 04:24:41,910
Oh, shit.

4259
04:24:42,410 --> 04:24:42,850
Oh, shoot.

4260
04:24:43,450 --> 04:24:43,850
Uh-oh.

Chaff?

4262
04:24:45,350 --> 04:24:46,230
Uh-oh, we're in trouble.

4263
04:24:46,510 --> 04:24:46,610
Ah!

4264
04:24:49,190 --> 04:24:50,050

Oh, there's chaffs over there.

4268

Okay, nice.

4281
04:27:21,580 --> 04:27:22,580
So hard to see.

4282
04:27:38,780 --> 04:27:40,360
Oh, maybe I should have gotten closer.

4283
04:27:42,540 --> 04:27:44,980
Like here, I can...

4284
04:27:46,700 --> 04:27:47,900
Uh, maybe not.

4285
04:27:50,620 --> 04:27:51,840
Wait, where is it here?

4286
04:27:52,140 --> 04:27:52,500
That's it.

4287
04:27:53,880 --> 04:27:54,240
You.

4288
04:27:55,060 --> 04:27:55,580
Nice.

4289
04:27:57,640 --> 04:27:58,160
And...

4290
04:27:58,900 --> 04:27:59,420
Uh...

4291
04:27:59,420 --> 04:28:00,420
Uh...

4292
04:28:00,420 --> 04:28:01,460
Oh, I can't see it.

4293
04:28:01,540 --> 04:28:02,240
Oh, there, there, there.

4294
04:28:04,600 --> 04:28:05,140
Got him.

4295
04:28:09,180 --> 04:28:10,780
No more Nikita missiles.

4296
04:28:11,760 --> 04:28:12,380
Peep-peep.

4297
04:28:13,140 --> 04:28:14,100
I think I can make it.

4298
04:28:17,680 --> 04:28:18,560
Grab it!

4299
04:28:24,480 --> 04:28:26,040
Run, snake, run!

4300
04:28:26,660 --> 04:28:27,000
No!

4301
04:28:28,520 --> 04:28:30,540
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, for real.

4302
04:28:30,780 --> 04:28:32,740
No, no, no.

4303
04:28:34,580 --> 04:28:35,620
Oh my gosh.

4304
04:28:37,280 --> 04:28:37,940
I was right, though.

4305
04:28:38,220 --> 04:28:39,280
I knew we'd make it.

4306
04:28:43,120 --> 04:28:43,260
Okay.

4307
04:28:44,600 --> 04:28:44,880
Um.

4308
04:28:45,580 --> 04:28:45,980
Worse?

4309
04:28:46,520 --> 04:28:47,620
We wouldn't have died, though.

4310
04:28:47,680 --> 04:28:48,360
We wouldn't have died.

4311
04:28:48,480 --> 04:28:49,100
It would have been fine.

4312
04:28:50,900 --> 04:28:52,560
Okay, let's go see our little buddy.

4313
04:28:53,620 --> 04:28:54,540
Our little piss pal.

4314
04:28:57,100 --> 04:28:59,000
And one of my favorite scenes of the game.

4315
04:29:06,900 --> 04:29:08,760
One of my favorite parts of the game.

4316
04:29:08,900 --> 04:29:09,440
Oh, save.

4317
04:29:09,960 --> 04:29:11,360
Yeah, I'll say it real quick.

4318
04:29:15,810 --> 04:29:17,090
Oh, he's saying the...

4319
04:29:19,050 --> 04:29:20,610
Are those the train stations?

4320
04:29:23,610 --> 04:29:26,590
Snake, you can't use the radar because something's jamming
it.

4321
04:29:26,810 --> 04:29:26,830
Yeah.

4322
04:29:26,930 --> 04:29:28,970
And whatever's doing it is very close to you.

4323
04:29:29,330 --> 04:29:29,830
Be careful.

4324
04:29:30,210 --> 04:29:31,450
I'm careful, I'm careful.

4325
04:29:36,350 --> 04:29:37,470
Whoa, it's so...

4326
04:29:37,470 --> 04:29:39,610
It's going back and forth between my headphones.

4327
04:29:39,950 --> 04:29:40,670
It's so crazy.

4328
04:29:48,060 --> 04:29:48,580
Whoa.

4329
04:29:48,960 --> 04:30:00,380
be careful snake thanks mailing um colonel i'm scared the
less you maneuver a remote controlled missile the faster it

4330
04:30:00,380 --> 04:30:07,740
will fly thanks remember this if you want to fire the
missile over a greater distance awesome thank you also

4331
04:30:07,740 --> 04:30:17,220
what's going on snake look at your sea rations they're
frozen you can't use frozen sea rats until they defrost you

4332
04:30:17,220 --> 04:30:21,460
won't be able to replenish your energy Wait, why are my
rations frozen?

4333
04:30:21,620 --> 04:30:22,500
In a warm place.

4334
04:30:23,060 --> 04:30:24,780
Probably just your bare skin would be fine.

4335
04:30:24,780 --> 04:30:25,380
My sea rats.

4336
04:30:26,680 --> 04:30:28,880
Who says sea rats?

4337
04:30:30,740 --> 04:30:31,760
Master Miller?

4338
04:30:32,280 --> 04:30:33,340
My sea rats are frozen.

4339
04:30:34,820 --> 04:30:34,860
Oh.

4340
04:30:36,000 --> 04:30:36,640
Gamer.

4341
04:30:37,160 --> 04:30:37,780
Gamer.

4342
04:30:38,160 --> 04:30:38,800
Gamer.

4343
04:30:38,900 --> 04:30:39,300
Gamer.

4344
04:30:41,420 --> 04:30:42,960
The sea rats.

4345
04:30:44,340 --> 04:30:45,900
Yo-ho, yo-ho.

4346
04:30:46,060 --> 04:30:47,580
The rat life for me.

4347
04:30:47,900 --> 04:30:48,940
I'm on the sea.

4348
04:30:48,960 --> 04:30:49,920
I am a rat.

4349
04:30:50,100 --> 04:30:51,940
I have no business here.

4350
04:30:53,760 --> 04:30:55,120
Merrill, are you okay?

4351
04:30:56,340 --> 04:30:59,160
Merrill, what are these holes and walls for?

4352
04:30:59,660 --> 04:31:00,160
Uh, bullets?

4353
04:31:00,380 --> 04:31:00,780
I don't know.

4354
04:31:01,340 --> 04:31:05,300
For blowing tiny particles of dust off people's bodies
before they enter the lab.

4355
04:31:05,660 --> 04:31:05,680
Oh.

4356
04:31:06,140 --> 04:31:08,180
I've never heard that dialogue before.

4357
04:31:10,460 --> 04:31:11,460
Nostasha, how you doing?

4358
04:31:11,620 --> 04:31:11,840
Good.

4359
04:31:12,300 --> 04:31:13,240
You found they so calm.

4360
04:31:13,300 --> 04:31:13,940
Yeah, I did.

4361
04:31:14,120 --> 04:31:16,000
That's a special operations command pistol.

4362
04:31:16,660 --> 04:31:20,240
It's a 45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power.

4363
04:31:20,960 --> 04:31:23,800
It's also equipped with a lamb from nighttime combat.

4364
04:31:25,340 --> 04:31:26,500
I love that artist lamb.

4365
04:31:26,840 --> 04:31:27,880
You can equip that too.

4366
04:31:28,840 --> 04:31:32,180
That pistol was designed specifically for use by special
forces.

4367
04:31:32,880 --> 04:31:34,180
So I think it will be useful.

4368
04:31:35,000 --> 04:31:37,360
Some people find it a little heavy in how to use.

4369
04:31:37,600 --> 04:31:37,880
Yeah.

4370
04:31:38,100 --> 04:31:39,920
But it shouldn't be a problem for you.

4371
04:31:41,140 --> 04:31:41,440
Okay.

4372
04:31:41,800 --> 04:31:43,800
The voices are a little...

4373
04:31:43,800 --> 04:31:45,020
Oh, these holes!

4374
04:31:46,540 --> 04:31:47,640
They look like...

4375
04:31:47,640 --> 04:31:48,940
They look like dominoes.

4376
04:31:50,560 --> 04:31:51,980
all right here we go

4377
04:31:55,740 --> 04:32:11,320

see oh okay this scene is so awesome oh

4378
04:32:16,260 --> 04:32:20,080
oh my gosh there's not as much blood so far

4379
04:32:29,800 --> 04:32:30,200
Yeah!

4380
04:32:39,760 --> 04:32:40,160
Oh!

4381
04:32:43,820 --> 04:32:44,220
Wait.

4382
04:32:45,160 --> 04:32:47,380
Wait, why did he take off his stealth camera?

4383
04:32:49,300 --> 04:32:51,080
Oh my god though, he sliced that guy in half.

4384
04:32:55,380 --> 04:32:56,800
No, no, you're supposed to be invisible.

4385
04:32:58,320 --> 04:32:59,220
Okay, that's kind of cool though.

4386
04:33:05,110 --> 04:33:06,730
No, you're supposed to be invisible though.

4387
04:33:08,710 --> 04:33:09,510
Take this!

4388
04:33:10,170 --> 04:33:10,570
Robin!

4389
04:33:11,430 --> 04:33:12,150
He's alive!

4390
04:33:17,640 --> 04:33:18,260
The music.

4391
04:33:21,520 --> 04:33:22,620
Caution, stand back.

4392
04:33:24,300 --> 04:33:27,020
Because the guy is supposed to be like, it's like he's a
ghost.

4393
04:33:29,000 --> 04:33:31,680
I don't know, I don't, I didn't really need to see the whole
scene.

4394
04:33:33,380 --> 04:33:35,740
It was so much more mysterious when we didn't see it.

4395
04:33:37,420 --> 04:33:37,740
You know?

4396
04:33:38,660 --> 04:33:42,500
And then obviously, like, he's supposed to be invisible, and
then like...

4397
04:33:42,500 --> 04:33:44,240
The guy's like, it's like he's a ghost.

4398
04:33:46,600 --> 04:33:50,100
Oh He's a skewer.

4399
04:33:51,160 --> 04:34:01,560
Oh my gosh, the barbecue No, that doesn't make any sense No,
that doesn't make any sense

4400
04:34:04,860 --> 04:34:06,040
You can see it.

4401
04:34:06,100 --> 04:34:07,620
Wow, he looks so cool though

4402
04:34:10,830 --> 04:34:17,910
Ghost Me music is also killing me.

4403
04:34:18,250 --> 04:34:18,250
Okay.

4404
04:34:19,070 --> 04:34:20,550
This scene was definitely...

4405
04:34:24,290 --> 04:34:24,770
I'm...

4406
04:34:24,770 --> 04:34:26,030
I'm not a fan.

4407
04:34:26,530 --> 04:34:29,310
Actually, I'm... I'm actually quite disappointed.

4408
04:34:29,910 --> 04:34:30,450
But that's okay.

4409
04:34:31,490 --> 04:34:32,250
That's fine.

4410
04:34:32,790 --> 04:34:33,850
I get it.

4411
04:34:34,710 --> 04:34:35,770
Not all the scenes are the same.

4412
04:34:35,910 --> 04:34:36,230
I got it.

4413
04:34:36,290 --> 04:34:37,170
Can I loot their bodies?

4414
04:34:39,030 --> 04:34:40,370
You got any rations?

4415
04:34:41,830 --> 04:34:44,830
Oh my gosh, I completely forgot that I could get dog tags in
this game.

4416
04:34:46,550 --> 04:34:48,710
Okay, time to fight!

4417
04:34:49,810 --> 04:34:50,330
Gray Fox.

4418
04:34:53,750 --> 04:34:54,490
I don't know.

4419
04:34:54,830 --> 04:34:55,630
Oh, my sea rats.

4420
04:34:55,810 --> 04:34:56,690
Wait, are they still frozen?

4421
04:34:56,910 --> 04:34:57,210
Uh-oh.

4422
04:34:57,630 --> 04:34:59,550
I'm gonna start calling them.

4423
04:35:04,150 --> 04:35:05,430
Stealth camouflage.

4424
04:35:06,330 --> 04:35:07,210
Who are you?

4425
04:35:07,990 --> 04:35:09,130
The nipples!

4426
04:35:11,250 --> 04:35:11,610
Ow!

4427
04:35:14,250 --> 04:35:15,230
On a corner!

4428
04:35:15,450 --> 04:35:16,190
Oh, no!

4429
04:35:17,350 --> 04:35:19,350
Where is my friend?

4430
04:35:19,830 --> 04:35:21,190
It gets me every time.

4431
04:35:21,670 --> 04:35:22,790
What are you talking about?

4432
04:35:22,990 --> 04:35:24,110
Right behind you.

4433
04:35:25,890 --> 04:35:26,390
Whoa!

4434
04:35:30,710 --> 04:35:31,410
Whoa!

4435
04:35:32,390 --> 04:35:37,130
Oh, what next?

4436
04:35:38,870 --> 04:35:41,090
They made him pee twice!

4437
04:35:42,610 --> 04:35:43,710
You're that ninja.

4438
04:35:44,030 --> 04:35:45,010
You're that ninja.

4439
04:35:45,170 --> 04:35:46,510
I've been waiting for you.

4440
04:35:46,550 --> 04:35:49,450
No, no, I don't need...

4441
04:35:49,450 --> 04:35:50,670
How did he have war?

4442
04:35:50,910 --> 04:35:52,290
Neither enemy nor friend.

4443
04:35:52,730 --> 04:35:53,330
Yes!

4444
04:35:53,710 --> 04:35:55,950
I am back from a world where such words are made.

4445
04:35:55,950 --> 04:35:57,450
Neither enemy nor friend.

4446
04:35:57,870 --> 04:35:59,470
Hear that maid.

4447
04:36:00,170 --> 04:36:03,010
Now you and I will battle to the death.

4448
04:36:03,670 --> 04:36:04,430
What do you want?

4449
04:36:04,570 --> 04:36:05,290
What do you want?

4450
04:36:05,630 --> 04:36:08,350
Oh, I've waited a long time for this day.

4451
04:36:09,290 --> 04:36:11,730
Now I want to enjoy this moment.

4452
04:36:12,050 --> 04:36:13,750
I think, uh...

4453
04:36:13,750 --> 04:36:14,630
Grey Fox still sounds...

4454
04:36:14,630 --> 04:36:15,750
Like I said...

4455
04:36:16,550 --> 04:36:17,150
Hold on.

4456
04:36:17,650 --> 04:36:19,770
It's like one of my Japanese anime.

4457
04:36:19,870 --> 04:36:20,050
Yeah.

4458
04:36:20,710 --> 04:36:23,630
I've come from another world to battle with you.

4459
04:36:24,030 --> 04:36:24,710
What is it?

4460
04:36:25,070 --> 04:36:25,510
Revenge.

4461
04:36:25,930 --> 04:36:31,850
Um, because of the voice effects on his, on it, like with
him, it doesn't sound so different, you know?

4462
04:36:32,050 --> 04:36:33,970
Maybe because...

4463
04:36:33,970 --> 04:36:37,690
Maybe side by side it does, but I think it sounds pretty
good.

4464
04:36:38,270 --> 04:36:39,310
He said the thing.

4465
04:36:39,530 --> 04:36:42,330
I will kill you, or you will kill me.

4466
04:36:43,470 --> 04:36:44,890
B is to punch.

04:36:46,550 --> 04:37:00,310

Okay, how do I beat him again?

4471
04:37:22,310 --> 04:37:23,590
I have to just punch him, right?

4472
04:37:25,390 --> 04:37:25,870
Yeah.

4473
04:37:26,670 --> 04:37:28,350
And then he does like a...

4474
04:37:28,350 --> 04:37:28,770
Whoa!

4475
04:37:30,590 --> 04:37:32,210
Oh, I can only get one hit in?

4476
04:37:41,110 --> 04:37:43,470
Okay, I'm hearing the differences more now.

4477
04:37:45,110 --> 04:37:48,030
I'm hearing the differences in the voice acting more now.

4478
04:37:49,750 --> 04:37:50,770
Where are you?

4479
04:37:51,410 --> 04:37:52,150
Oh, come here.

4480
04:37:52,630 --> 04:37:53,330
Come here.

4481
04:37:57,690 --> 04:37:59,070
I can't kick him.

4482
04:38:01,890 --> 04:38:03,070
Why can't I kick you?

4483
04:38:03,250 --> 04:38:03,350
Oh.

4484
04:38:06,270 --> 04:38:06,830
Ah!

4485
04:38:06,830 --> 04:38:07,390
No!

4486
04:38:07,650 --> 04:38:08,870
I was in mid-attack!

4487
04:38:10,970 --> 04:38:12,350
Oh my gosh.

4488
04:38:12,530 --> 04:38:13,030
Oh, my gosh.

4489
04:38:13,790 --> 04:38:16,830
Oh, nice.

4490
04:38:16,930 --> 04:38:17,210
There we go.

4491
04:38:20,130 --> 04:38:21,390
I don't remember when.

4492
04:38:21,590 --> 04:38:22,510
I can.

4493
04:38:25,350 --> 04:38:27,350
When can I start using my gun?

4494
04:38:27,450 --> 04:38:28,390
I don't remember.

4495
04:38:29,830 --> 04:38:30,470
Oh, out.

4496
04:38:51,480 --> 04:38:57,780
That'd be so funny if you, I just realized, wait, I need my,
they're still frozen.

4497
04:38:58,000 --> 04:39:00,180
Oh gosh, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4498
04:39:00,260 --> 04:39:01,580
Hold on, my sea rats.

4499
04:39:02,180 --> 04:39:03,020
My sea rats.

4500
04:39:10,650 --> 04:39:12,350
Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

4501
04:39:19,850 --> 04:39:21,590
Oh, keep, please, Snake.

4502
04:39:22,490 --> 04:39:24,510
Oh, when he's, like, in mid-action.

4503
04:39:25,270 --> 04:39:26,210
Oh, my God, the GameCube!

4504
04:39:28,490 --> 04:39:29,550
There we go.

4505
04:39:29,790 --> 04:39:30,030
Nice.

4506
04:39:32,030 --> 04:39:32,770
There, there, wow.

4507
04:39:33,730 --> 04:39:37,910
And then I have to remember that one last part where he,
like, goes kind of in, right?

4508
04:39:38,130 --> 04:39:40,510
Oh, they're better, they're better.

4509
04:39:40,690 --> 04:39:40,970
Nice.

4510
04:39:42,450 --> 04:39:43,050
Oh, hello?

4511
04:39:44,710 --> 04:39:45,670
Invincibility frames?

4512
04:39:46,330 --> 04:39:46,970
Excuse me?

4513
04:39:47,770 --> 04:39:49,450
Oh my god, that is unfair.

4514
04:39:50,130 --> 04:39:50,810
That is unfair.

4515
04:39:51,570 --> 04:39:52,250
Excuse me, sir.

4516
04:39:52,810 --> 04:39:53,650
I kicked you.

4517
04:39:55,590 --> 04:39:56,590
And you...

4518
04:39:56,590 --> 04:39:58,570
Oh, oh, I got stuck on the wall.

4519
04:39:58,710 --> 04:39:58,970
That's okay.

4520
04:40:01,010 --> 04:40:01,510
Okay.

4521
04:40:02,030 --> 04:40:02,690
This is...

4522
04:40:02,690 --> 04:40:03,950
Don't hurt the GameCube.

4523
04:40:04,990 --> 04:40:06,130
Don't hurt Mario!

4524
04:40:07,810 --> 04:40:09,710
Why can't I only get one hit in?

4525
04:40:11,790 --> 04:40:12,090
Hello.

4526
04:40:15,220 --> 04:40:17,200
Whoa, yeah, well...

4527
04:40:17,200 --> 04:40:17,980
He's going...

4528
04:40:17,980 --> 04:40:19,500
He's going crazy mode.

4529
04:40:19,720 --> 04:40:22,100
He's going Insano style.

4530
04:40:22,960 --> 04:40:24,880
He's parkouring all over me.

4531
04:40:25,080 --> 04:40:26,180
Oh, there we go.

4532
04:40:29,950 --> 04:40:34,210
Can you stop doing Cirque du Soleil for two seconds?

4533
04:40:37,070 --> 04:40:37,610
Oh my god.

4534
04:40:43,130 --> 04:40:43,250
Please.

4535
04:40:43,610 --> 04:40:44,030
Oh my god.

4536
04:40:44,310 --> 04:40:44,790
Oh my god.

4537
04:40:49,160 --> 04:40:49,800
Nice.

4538
04:40:50,200 --> 04:40:50,820
There we go.

4539
04:40:50,840 --> 04:40:50,940
Oh.

4540
04:40:51,920 --> 04:40:53,840
Hurt me more, Snake.

4541
04:40:55,840 --> 04:40:56,480
Oh.

4542
04:40:58,620 --> 04:40:59,960
No, I'm so bad at this part.

4543
04:41:00,180 --> 04:41:01,040
Oh, no, wait.

4544
04:41:01,240 --> 04:41:02,480
Oh, oh, oh, never mind.

4545
04:41:03,140 --> 04:41:04,380
I know exactly where you are.

4546
04:41:06,360 --> 04:41:07,980
Hurry up and catch me.

4547
04:41:10,940 --> 04:41:11,380
Okay.

4548
04:41:13,680 --> 04:41:14,680
Oh, I saw where you went.

4549
04:41:15,780 --> 04:41:16,060
Nice.

4550
04:41:17,860 --> 04:41:18,740
Oh, uh.

4551
04:41:19,460 --> 04:41:19,660
Oh, no.

4552
04:41:27,140 --> 04:41:27,580
Yeah.

4553
04:41:32,500 --> 04:41:33,300
Yep.

4554
04:41:34,540 --> 04:41:34,560
Uh.

4555
04:41:35,660 --> 04:41:36,460
Oh.

4556
04:41:37,360 --> 04:41:38,940
When can I use my gun?

4557
04:41:39,960 --> 04:41:40,760
Oh shit.

4558
04:41:41,260 --> 04:41:41,580
Ah!

4559
04:41:42,680 --> 04:41:43,660
Uh oh.

4560
04:41:43,980 --> 04:41:44,240
Okay.

4561
04:41:45,360 --> 04:41:45,640
He do.

4562
04:41:48,700 --> 04:41:50,360
Is he gonna come get me?

4563
04:41:51,180 --> 04:41:51,460
Run?

4564
04:41:59,810 --> 04:42:00,910
Where are you?

4565
04:42:01,430 --> 04:42:01,890
Hello?

4566
04:42:07,930 --> 04:42:09,110
Hurt me more.

4567
04:42:09,630 --> 04:42:11,130
Hurt me more.

4568
04:42:11,530 --> 04:42:11,970
Snake.

4569
04:42:12,190 --> 04:42:12,490
Hey!

4570
04:42:18,150 --> 04:42:20,450
She said the thing.

4571
04:42:21,970 --> 04:42:21,990
Nice.

4572
04:42:25,090 --> 04:42:27,730
Yeah, we punched each other in Zanzibar.

4573
04:42:28,930 --> 04:42:29,530
Remember...

4574
04:42:29,530 --> 04:42:31,070
Oh, dang it.

4575
04:42:31,170 --> 04:42:36,850
I remember when I punched you, and you punched me.

4576
04:42:37,270 --> 04:42:41,170
Oh, we were punching each other in Zanzibar.

4577
04:42:41,650 --> 04:42:42,010
I remember.

4578
04:42:42,290 --> 04:42:43,370
Remember that at good times.

4579
04:42:44,530 --> 04:42:44,950
Oh, shit.

4580
04:42:45,190 --> 04:42:46,070
Oh, my God.

4581
04:42:46,310 --> 04:42:47,110
No, no, snake, get up.

4582
04:42:47,430 --> 04:42:47,870
Get up, please.

4583
04:42:48,090 --> 04:42:48,910
Oh, snake.

4584
04:42:49,790 --> 04:42:52,650
Oh, yeah.

4585
04:42:53,290 --> 04:42:53,570
It's okay.

4586
04:42:54,890 --> 04:42:55,790
He won't see me here.

4587
04:42:56,550 --> 04:42:56,870
Just kidding.

4588
04:42:58,690 --> 04:42:59,310
Be doop.

4589
04:43:00,110 --> 04:43:01,750
Can I like, give me like two seconds, okay?

4590
04:43:01,990 --> 04:43:02,390
Great box.

4591
04:43:03,570 --> 04:43:03,910
Never mind.

4592
04:43:04,970 --> 04:43:07,450
Like two seconds to regain my composure.

4593
04:43:09,070 --> 04:43:09,430
Okay, cool.

4594
04:43:10,690 --> 04:43:10,990
All right.

4595
04:43:17,090 --> 04:43:18,730
The feeling of battle.

4596
04:43:22,540 --> 04:43:23,660
So awesome.

4597
04:43:25,820 --> 04:43:28,360
Come on, do your little teleporty thing.

4598
04:43:30,040 --> 04:43:31,060
Come on, come here.

4599
04:43:33,240 --> 04:43:34,340
There we go.

4600
04:43:34,980 --> 04:43:36,340
Nice, nice.

4601
04:43:38,160 --> 04:43:38,560
Go up a bit.

4602
04:43:40,360 --> 04:43:41,760
We got two hits in.

4603
04:43:42,180 --> 04:43:43,200
Hurt me more!

4604
04:43:43,920 --> 04:43:45,840
Come on, come on, come on!

4605
04:43:47,780 --> 04:43:48,700
Oh, out.

4606
04:43:51,860 --> 04:43:53,460
All I've been doing is running away.

4607
04:43:55,100 --> 04:44:03,200
I still have a lot of rations, so I think we're mostly good,
but at the same time, it's better to be safe than sorry, you

4608
04:44:03,200 --> 04:44:03,400
know?

4609
04:44:08,430 --> 04:44:09,230
Oh, my god.

4610
04:44:09,530 --> 04:44:09,810
Oh, my god.

4611
04:44:12,410 --> 04:44:13,590
That's good, Snake.

4612
04:44:15,510 --> 04:44:17,030
Can you, like...

4613
04:44:17,030 --> 04:44:18,310
Oh, my God.

4614
04:44:21,110 --> 04:44:22,350
Oh, my God.

4615
04:44:25,210 --> 04:44:26,050
Hey dude!

4616
04:44:27,310 --> 04:44:27,650
Hey dude!

4617
04:44:28,850 --> 04:44:31,290
Why is it that every time he punches me?

4618
04:44:36,280 --> 04:44:39,900
It, um, makes me like start losing blood.

4619
04:44:44,400 --> 04:44:46,060
Hurt me more!

4620
04:44:51,680 --> 04:44:52,320
Nice!

4621
04:44:54,100 --> 04:44:55,640
Nah, come on here, come on here.

4622
04:44:55,760 --> 04:44:56,420
Because of the edge.

4623
04:44:59,520 --> 04:45:01,760
I can't even punch well, ninja.

4624
04:45:02,340 --> 04:45:02,860
Okay.

4625
04:45:03,680 --> 04:45:04,160
Oh,

4626
04:45:07,680 --> 04:45:08,640
I totally missed you.

4627
04:45:14,060 --> 04:45:16,460
I can't punch well either, apparently.

4628
04:45:17,400 --> 04:45:19,140
Oh, his knife hands got it.

4629
04:45:19,680 --> 04:45:21,780
I love if I just touch him, it hurts me, though, even.

4630
04:45:25,250 --> 04:45:26,650
Hurt me more.

4631
04:45:28,510 --> 04:45:28,990
Mew.

4632
04:45:29,250 --> 04:45:29,370
Oh,

4633
04:45:33,730 --> 04:45:35,330
just a little bit.

4634
04:45:35,510 --> 04:45:36,190
Just a little bit more.

4635
04:45:37,350 --> 04:45:37,650
Ouch.

4636
04:45:41,740 --> 04:45:58,760
I'm trying Stand still I'll hurt you, I'll hurt you Oh, oh
Ouch It's okay Yippee Okay, don't touch him Don't touch him

4637
04:45:58,760 --> 04:46:04,460
Wait, yeah, yeah, don't touch him Don't touch him Shoot,

4638
04:46:07,820 --> 04:46:09,160
Is it gonna go

4639
04:46:13,500 --> 04:46:15,980
Oh, oh my god.

4640
04:46:16,040 --> 04:46:17,400
Oh, oh, oh.

4641
04:46:18,900 --> 04:46:19,340
Ouch.

4642
04:46:21,360 --> 04:46:22,300
Oh, oh.

4643
04:46:22,580 --> 04:46:27,880
See, this is what we could have been doing the whole time,
but someone had to be like, zippity-doo-doo-doo, all over

4644
04:46:27,880 --> 04:46:28,280
the place.

4645
04:46:29,380 --> 04:46:29,940
It's also mean.

4646
04:46:30,080 --> 04:46:31,400
I was running everywhere, too.

4647
04:46:33,180 --> 04:46:33,520
Oh.

4648
04:46:36,280 --> 04:46:38,440
This guy was avoiding bullets.

4649
04:46:38,780 --> 04:46:40,240
And then...

4650
04:46:46,450 --> 04:46:48,770
Wait, wait, where's the last part of the fight?

4651
04:46:50,870 --> 04:46:52,550
Where's the last part of the fight?

4652
04:46:54,110 --> 04:46:55,310
You're dead?

4653
04:46:56,470 --> 04:46:58,490
No, no electrophase?

4654
04:46:59,270 --> 04:47:00,110
Say it.

4655
04:47:00,410 --> 04:47:01,370
It can't be.

4656
04:47:02,270 --> 04:47:03,790
You were killed in Zanzibar.

4657
04:47:04,550 --> 04:47:05,150
Zanzibar!

4658
04:47:08,370 --> 04:47:08,970
Oh.

4659
04:47:10,390 --> 04:47:11,150
Wait, is it here?

4660
04:47:11,870 --> 04:47:13,010
No, this happens anyway.

4661
04:47:13,510 --> 04:47:13,730
Right?

4662
04:47:14,730 --> 04:47:33,930
not again I love how they kept this part even though it was
a dropped subplot oh crazy bang your head on the floor oh my

4663
04:47:33,930 --> 04:47:47,730
god great fox no oh my god oh no oh he's crazy what's going
on I'm losing myself.

4664
04:47:53,320 --> 04:47:54,600
Aw, gray fox.

4665
04:47:54,880 --> 04:47:54,940
Oh.

4666
04:47:56,440 --> 04:47:57,700
Are you just gonna...

4667
04:47:57,700 --> 04:47:58,640
Are you...

4668
04:47:58,640 --> 04:47:59,360
Uh...

4669
04:47:59,360 --> 04:48:00,220
Uh...

4670
04:48:00,220 --> 04:48:01,020
Is it over?

4671
04:48:01,340 --> 04:48:02,520
Are you just gonna run out?

4672
04:48:05,920 --> 04:48:06,200
Um...

4673
04:48:06,840 --> 04:48:07,940
The medicine.

4674
04:48:10,940 --> 04:48:12,020
Take your meds, everybody.

4675
04:48:25,230 --> 04:48:26,470
Snake, this might be a good one.

4676
04:48:26,490 --> 04:48:27,710
Good time to move.

4677
04:48:29,590 --> 04:48:31,110
Snake, this might be a good...

4678
04:48:31,110 --> 04:48:33,170
Why is he always just standing there?

4679
04:48:34,470 --> 04:48:37,190
He stood there and got blasted by the tank.

4680
04:48:37,650 --> 04:48:38,170
Like...

4681
04:48:38,990 --> 04:48:41,290
Colonel, that ninja is Gray Fox.

4682
04:48:41,790 --> 04:48:42,710
No doubt about it.

4683
04:48:43,390 --> 04:48:43,910
Ridiculous.

4684
04:48:44,170 --> 04:48:44,510
He said it.

4685
04:48:44,510 --> 04:48:46,630
You yourself in Zanzibar land.

4686
04:48:46,810 --> 04:48:47,930
He said, I'm Gray Fox.

4687
04:48:48,770 --> 04:48:51,290
He should have been killed, but he's still alive.

4688
04:48:51,890 --> 04:48:52,190
What?

4689
04:48:52,650 --> 04:48:54,490
It happened before I joined Fox.

4690
04:48:54,490 --> 04:48:55,810
What do you know about that, Naomi, huh?

4691
04:48:56,490 --> 04:48:58,690
were using a soldier for their gene therapy experiments.

4692
04:48:58,730 --> 04:48:59,530
What do you know about that, Naomi?

4693
04:48:59,710 --> 04:49:00,750
I never heard that.

4694
04:49:00,970 --> 04:49:02,710
It happened right after you retired.

4695
04:49:03,390 --> 04:49:05,610
My predecessor, Dr. Clark, was in charge.

4696
04:49:06,070 --> 04:49:06,830
Dr. Clark?

4697
04:49:07,050 --> 04:49:08,130
Dr. Clark.

4698
04:49:08,350 --> 04:49:10,030
He started the gene therapy project.

4699
04:49:10,630 --> 04:49:11,730
And where is he now?

4700
04:49:12,010 --> 04:49:12,290
Dead.

4701
04:49:12,290 --> 04:49:15,070
There was killed in an explosion in his lab two years ago.

4702
04:49:15,590 --> 04:49:17,010
So what about this soldier?

4703
04:49:17,590 --> 04:49:23,030
Apparently for their test subject, they decided to use the
body of a soldier who was recovered after the fall of

4704
04:49:23,030 --> 04:49:23,890
Zanzibar land.

4705
04:49:24,610 --> 04:49:25,950
And that was Grey Fox.

4706
04:49:26,490 --> 04:49:36,850
but he was already dead yes i miss english naomi here i'll
redo the lines they fed him with a prototype exos while they

4707
04:49:36,850 --> 04:49:44,410
experimented on him like plato today's genome soldiers were
born from those experiments that's the sickest thing i've

4708
04:49:44,410 --> 04:49:55,270
ever heard i'm sorry colonel i didn't think my accent would
offend you so much because it's confidential information is

4709
04:49:55,270 --> 04:50:01,890
that the only reason Naomi, what happened to Gray Fox after
that?

4710
04:50:02,390 --> 04:50:03,950
The record said he died in an accident.

4711
04:50:04,870 --> 04:50:05,810
I'm sorry.

4712
04:50:06,030 --> 04:50:10,490
But even if that ninja is Gray Fox, the question is, he
hated it.

4713
04:50:11,390 --> 04:50:13,510
That was Australian?

4714
04:50:14,450 --> 04:50:17,310
You're saying he's just living off his will to fight?

4715
04:50:17,650 --> 04:50:21,650
I'm not sure, but he seems intent on fighting me to the
death.

4716
04:50:22,350 --> 04:50:23,170
We'll meet again.

4717
04:50:23,630 --> 04:50:24,210
I know it.

4718
04:50:24,510 --> 04:50:24,790
Yeah.

4719
04:50:24,790 --> 04:50:25,490
So you'll fight again?

4720
04:50:26,490 --> 04:50:27,470
until you kill him.

4721
04:50:27,650 --> 04:50:28,190
Shut up, Naomi.

4722
04:50:29,250 --> 04:50:30,310
I'd rather not.

4723
04:50:30,950 --> 04:50:32,090
But maybe that's what he wants.

4724
04:50:32,350 --> 04:50:32,930
That's what he wants.

4725
04:50:33,190 --> 04:50:34,110
He said hurt me more.

4726
04:50:34,670 --> 04:50:35,490
It was consensual.

4727
04:50:37,210 --> 04:50:38,670
Look at the little GameCube.

4728
04:50:40,610 --> 04:50:41,810
Oh my gosh.

4729
04:50:42,030 --> 04:50:42,630
It's so cute.

4730
04:50:43,350 --> 04:50:44,730
It looks just like actually...

4731
04:50:44,730 --> 04:50:45,850
Sorry, my GameCube is black.

4732
04:50:47,030 --> 04:50:48,410
I was gonna say it looks just like mine.

4733
04:50:48,690 --> 04:50:49,090
It is not.

4734
04:50:50,290 --> 04:50:51,110
An anime?

4735
04:50:51,330 --> 04:50:51,930
No, I'm not.

4736
04:50:52,370 --> 04:50:53,510
I always work alone.

4737
04:50:55,150 --> 04:50:55,590
Alone?

4738
04:50:55,790 --> 04:50:56,050
Alone?

4739
04:50:56,490 --> 04:51:06,590

to rescue me my headphones are starting to hurt my ears
there's something that i've got to do first oh oh well at

4742
04:51:34,450 --> 04:51:35,530
least you're not one of them

4743
04:51:41,750 --> 04:51:43,050
are you hurt

4744
04:51:49,910 --> 04:51:58,030
i'm okay i just twisted my ankle a little trying to get away
it's okay my son is used to people being me stop i want to

4745
04:51:58,030 --> 04:52:01,950
ask you something i need information about metal Huh?

4746
04:52:03,110 --> 04:52:03,490
Metal Gear?

4747
04:52:04,250 --> 04:52:04,470
Yeah.

4748
04:52:04,770 --> 04:52:06,350
Well, the posters aren't in this one.

4749
04:52:06,770 --> 04:52:06,970
Oh, wait.

4750
04:52:08,590 --> 04:52:10,470
It's a mobile TMD.

4751
04:52:10,590 --> 04:52:11,530
Wait, what is that poster?

4752
04:52:11,730 --> 04:52:12,710
It's designed to shoot down nuclear missiles.

4753
04:52:12,870 --> 04:52:13,170
It's not police, not.

4754
04:52:13,170 --> 04:52:14,930
Only for defensive purposes, of course.

4755
04:52:15,590 --> 04:52:15,970
Liar!

4756
04:52:16,810 --> 04:52:19,550
I already know that Metal Gear is nothing but a nuclear
equipped.

4757
04:52:19,830 --> 04:52:20,950
Stop shaking him!

4758
04:52:22,070 --> 04:52:22,510
Nuclear?

4759
04:52:23,030 --> 04:52:24,650
Why are you acting like a bully?

4760
04:52:24,850 --> 04:52:26,470
He's like a high school bully to him.

4761
04:52:26,830 --> 04:52:28,930
The terrorists are planning to use Metal Gear to launch a
nuclear missile.

4762
04:52:29,270 --> 04:52:30,510
Oh, it's Zone of the Ender.

4763
04:52:30,770 --> 04:52:31,730
Oh my god.

4764
04:52:31,830 --> 04:52:36,030
Aren't they just trying to use the TMD missile module to
launch a disabled nuclear warhead?

4765
04:52:36,050 --> 04:52:39,030
He's so unbothered by it, which is even funnier.

4766
04:52:39,330 --> 04:52:44,650
The purpose of this exercise was to test Metal Gear's
nuclear launch capability using a dummy nuclear warhead.

4767
04:52:44,710 --> 04:52:47,450
The terrorists are just continuing the work you started.

4768
04:52:48,390 --> 04:52:49,610
No, you're wrong.

4769
04:52:50,270 --> 04:52:52,450
I heard it directly from your boss, Baker.

4770
04:52:54,230 --> 04:52:54,710
No.

4771
04:52:55,090 --> 04:52:55,690
No.

4772
04:52:55,770 --> 04:52:57,750
A nuclear missile on Rex?

4773
04:52:57,950 --> 04:52:58,370
No.

4774
04:52:59,090 --> 04:53:00,550
So you really didn't know.

4775
04:53:00,770 --> 04:53:01,930
A lot of con.

4776
04:53:02,690 --> 04:53:03,530
Little babies.

4777
04:53:05,950 --> 04:53:07,450
He's like, right here.

4778
04:53:08,630 --> 04:53:11,190
All the armament was built by a separate department.

4779
04:53:11,550 --> 04:53:12,110
The...

4780
04:53:12,110 --> 04:53:15,210
And the president personally supervised the final assembly
with the main unit.

4781
04:53:15,350 --> 04:53:17,670
The picture on his badge looks like...

4782
04:53:17,670 --> 04:53:18,010
President Baker.

4783
04:53:18,590 --> 04:53:20,770
Looks like his PS, like the original...

4784
04:53:21,510 --> 04:53:22,770
Metal Gear model.

4785
04:53:23,470 --> 04:53:27,090
I only know it's equipped with a Vulcan cannon, a laser, and
a rail gun.

4786
04:53:27,210 --> 04:53:28,390
Rail gun!

4787
04:53:30,770 --> 04:53:33,170
Do you guys remember that old video?

4788
04:53:34,250 --> 04:53:34,390
Nail gun!

4789
04:53:34,590 --> 04:53:38,070
It uses magnets to fire bullets at extremely high
velocities.

4790
04:53:38,370 --> 04:53:40,050
Every time they say rail gun, it makes me want to say it.

4791
04:53:40,050 --> 04:53:42,790
The technology was originally developed for the SDI system
and later scrapped.

4792
04:53:43,530 --> 04:53:49,050
We were successful in miniaturizing it in a joint venture
between Arms Tech and Rivermore National Labs.

4793
04:53:49,790 --> 04:53:51,510
The rail gun is on Rex's right arm.

4794
04:53:52,170 --> 04:53:54,950
Metal Gear's main function is to launch nuclear missiles.

4795
04:53:55,490 --> 04:53:57,130
You sure you're not forgetting something?

4796
04:53:57,610 --> 04:54:00,750
It's true that Metal Gear has a missile module on his back
that can be used.

4797
04:54:00,770 --> 04:54:06,350
carry up to eight missiles but are you saying it was
originally meant to carry nuclear missiles

4798
04:54:11,190 --> 04:54:19,110
oh yeah but that's not all I think if Metal Gear fired only
standard nuclear missiles then they should already have all

4799
04:54:19,110 --> 04:54:24,890
the practical data they need Ristelle welcome to my push-up
thank you so much could it be

4800
04:54:29,490 --> 04:54:38,630
metal gears co-developer labs was working on a new type of
nuclear weapon they were using Nova and NIF laser nuclear

4801
04:54:38,630 --> 04:54:45,710
fusion testing equipment and supercomputers well so they
developed a new type of nuclear weapon in a VR testing lab

4802
04:54:45,710 --> 04:54:56,350
huh yes but you can't use virtual data on a battlefield they
would need actual launch data hmm these are some of the

4803
04:54:56,350 --> 04:55:03,310
supercomputers if you link these you can test everything in
a Leo, how can the membership?

4804
04:55:03,430 --> 04:55:03,790
Thank you!

4805
04:55:03,870 --> 04:55:05,270
It's all just theoretical.

4806
04:55:06,930 --> 04:55:10,350
So, this exercise was designed to test the real thing.

4807
04:55:11,410 --> 04:55:13,250
What did our president do?

4808
04:55:13,690 --> 04:55:14,750
Oh, Otakai.

4809
04:55:15,210 --> 04:55:15,830
Oh, Otakai.

4810
04:55:15,970 --> 04:55:18,150
The terrorists launched that thing?

4811
04:55:19,550 --> 04:55:19,910
No.

4812
04:55:20,150 --> 04:55:21,310
Oh, and you're Nikes.

4813
04:55:21,910 --> 04:55:22,210
Damn!

4814
04:55:24,690 --> 04:55:24,930
Damn.

4815
04:55:27,070 --> 04:55:28,890
I'm such a fool.

4816
04:55:28,970 --> 04:55:29,330
Snakes.

4817
04:55:30,010 --> 04:55:31,130
It's all my fault.

4818
04:55:34,510 --> 04:55:36,650
No, it's a- The truth is...

4819
04:55:38,790 --> 04:55:41,310
My grandfather was part of the Manhattan Project.

4820
04:55:42,810 --> 04:55:45,690
He suffered with a guilt for the rest of his life.

4821
04:55:47,270 --> 04:55:47,930
And my father?

4822
04:55:49,470 --> 04:55:52,130
He was born on August 6th, 1945.

4823
04:55:52,710 --> 04:55:54,590
The day of the Hiroshima bomb.

4824
04:55:54,810 --> 04:55:55,730
Huey is the devil.

4825
04:55:55,990 --> 04:55:57,210
God's got a sense of humor, all right.

4826
04:55:57,490 --> 04:55:58,250
He is the devil.

4827
04:55:58,490 --> 04:55:59,990
Three generations of Emmerich men.

4828
04:56:01,270 --> 04:56:02,210
I can't with that.

4829
04:56:02,330 --> 04:56:13,590
must have the curse of nuclear weapons written into our DNA
no Huey I used to think that guy sucks he's the literal

4830
04:56:13,590 --> 04:56:27,230
devil I was the one being used no how you didn't know that's
only an anime oh no how that's enough crying pull yourself

4831
04:56:27,230 --> 04:56:38,770
together you're so mean in this where is metal gear where on
this base are they keeping it anime is real how yeah rex is

4832
04:56:38,770 --> 04:56:46,310
in the underground maintenance base where's that where north
of the communications tower but it's a long way there the

4833
04:56:46,310 --> 04:56:54,290
emergency override system for the detonation code is there
too yeah in the base's control room you'd better hurry if

4834
04:56:54,290 --> 04:56:59,010
they were planning a launch from the start then their
ballistic program is probably finished and since They

4835
04:56:59,010 --> 04:57:00,590
haven't called for me in a few hours.

4836
04:57:00,750 --> 04:57:02,810
They must not need me in other words.

4837
04:57:03,350 --> 04:57:07,390
They must be ready to launch We gotta go stop it code
override keys.

4838
04:57:07,450 --> 04:57:12,670
Yeah, we gotta put in the override keys and stop it for sure
We'll have to destroy Rex.

4839
04:57:12,710 --> 04:57:13,150
Yeah.

4840
04:57:13,370 --> 04:57:23,750
Oh no I need to I need to use that guy in the later game Oh
you're hurt you'll just slow me down.

4841
04:57:24,110 --> 04:57:28,050
Oh You'll need me if you're gonna destroy Rex true.

4842
04:57:28,490 --> 04:57:33,470
I don't need you Hey, you said earlier I need that guy.

4843
04:57:33,530 --> 04:57:33,530
I created Rex.

4844
04:57:34,050 --> 04:57:34,710
It's my right.

4845
04:57:35,250 --> 04:57:36,870
My duty to destroy him.

4846
04:57:37,050 --> 04:57:39,050
If you get a chance, try to escape.

4847
04:57:39,190 --> 04:57:39,690
Don't do that.

4848
04:57:39,850 --> 04:57:42,270
When the coast is clear, I'll contact you by Kodak.

4849
04:57:43,390 --> 04:57:45,990
How am I supposed to escape from an island?

4850
04:57:48,890 --> 04:57:49,310
Okay.

4851
04:57:50,910 --> 04:57:51,830
Last luck on the membership.

4852
04:57:52,070 --> 04:57:52,330
Thank you.

4853
04:57:52,350 --> 04:57:53,270
Thank you guys for joining me.

4854
04:57:53,350 --> 04:57:53,450
We appreciate it.

4855
04:57:53,450 --> 04:57:55,690
I want you to hide somewhere and keep me informed.

4856
04:57:56,130 --> 04:57:57,630
You know this place well, don't you?

4857
04:57:58,870 --> 04:58:08,490
do and don't worry I've got this oh well it's the same
stealth technology as he looks so much like Foxhound was

4858
04:58:08,490 --> 04:58:15,930
gonna use them but with the glass I'll be fine bad leg and
all and he looks so much like MGS one but I want Meryl to

4859
04:58:15,930 --> 04:58:23,010
watch out you too thank you for the birthday wait did Snake
just smile that's what that would be 32 thank you okay

4861
04:58:32,190 --> 04:58:32,850
Oh no!

4862
04:58:33,190 --> 04:58:34,630
Merrill, what happened?

4863
04:58:34,790 --> 04:58:36,110
Merrill, Merrill.

4864
04:58:38,310 --> 04:58:38,890
Mario!

4865
04:58:39,630 --> 04:58:40,290
Something's wrong.

4866
04:58:41,310 --> 04:58:42,290
Did you hear something?

4867
04:58:43,370 --> 04:58:44,830
Wasn't that some kind of music?

4868
04:58:45,190 --> 04:58:46,250
Some kind of music.

4869
04:58:46,370 --> 04:58:46,770
Mario!

4870
04:58:46,910 --> 04:58:48,050
What did she look like?

4871
04:58:50,030 --> 04:58:51,750
She's got a nice butt.

4872
04:58:52,870 --> 04:58:53,930
We know that for sure.

4873
04:58:54,830 --> 04:58:56,370
She's kind of cute the way she walks.

4874
04:58:58,190 --> 04:58:58,770
She...

4875
04:58:58,870 --> 04:59:02,250
She was wearing the same green uniform as the terrorists.

4876
04:59:05,350 --> 04:59:05,870
Oh.

4877
04:59:07,330 --> 04:59:11,550
And she- If she's disguised as the enemy, you'll have to
contact her when she's alone, huh?

4878
04:59:11,810 --> 04:59:13,050
Wait, you didn't talk about her butt!

4879
04:59:13,130 --> 04:59:15,510
There's only one place where we can be sure she's by
herself.

4880
04:59:15,830 --> 04:59:17,070
You didn't talk about her butt!

4881
04:59:17,250 --> 04:59:17,650
Where's that?

4882
04:59:18,290 --> 04:59:19,830
Don't be so dense.

4883
04:59:20,630 --> 04:59:22,510
Oh, the girl's bathroom.

4884
04:59:22,750 --> 04:59:24,570
Here, use this security card.

4885
04:59:25,670 --> 04:59:27,210
Otakon is a gentleman now.

4886
04:59:28,870 --> 04:59:30,570
It's security level four.

4887
04:59:30,830 --> 04:59:33,370
You guys, it was too raunchy for Nintendo, okay?

4888
04:59:36,130 --> 04:59:38,470
Nintendo said, oh, no, no, no.

4889
04:59:38,930 --> 04:59:40,650
No talking about girls' butts, please.

4890
04:59:40,710 --> 04:59:41,290
You're not in pain, are you?

4891
04:59:41,730 --> 04:59:41,970
Huh?

4892
04:59:42,250 --> 04:59:42,470
No.

4893
04:59:43,450 --> 04:59:44,550
You feel okay?

4894
04:59:44,690 --> 04:59:45,230
This part.

4895
04:59:46,090 --> 04:59:47,330
Nothing bothering you.

4896
04:59:48,290 --> 04:59:49,150
What's wrong?

4897
04:59:49,790 --> 04:59:51,570
You're all friendly all of a sudden.

4898
04:59:53,190 --> 04:59:53,990
No, nothing.

4899
04:59:54,370 --> 04:59:56,410
I'm just glad you're okay.

4900
04:59:57,490 --> 04:59:58,650
You're strange.

4901
05:00:00,510 --> 05:00:12,250
I'm a little nervous Everyone else I've saved suddenly dies
Your bad luck Your bad luck Forget it, doctor If I shoot

4902
05:00:12,250 --> 05:00:14,150

4903
05:00:15,710 --> 05:00:21,210
Call me Otakon It stands for Otakon Oh, sorry, spoilers,
sorry What does it stand for?

4904
05:00:21,390 --> 05:00:26,990
It stands for Otaku Convention An Otaku is a guy like me who

4905
05:00:27,630 --> 05:00:29,330
Oh, oh yeah Yeah.

Yeah.

4909
05:00:30,710 --> 05:00:30,710
Yeah.

4910
05:00:30,890 --> 05:00:31,150
Yeah.

4911
05:00:31,150 --> 05:00:31,310
Yeah.

4912
05:00:31,310 --> 05:00:31,330
Yeah.

4913
05:00:31,330 --> 05:00:31,330
Yeah.

4914
05:00:31,330 --> 05:00:32,250
Is this one of the enders?

4915
05:00:32,830 --> 05:00:33,510
Oh, there it is.

4916
05:00:33,730 --> 05:00:33,730
Yeah.

4917
05:00:33,850 --> 05:00:33,850
Yeah.

4918
05:00:34,110 --> 05:00:36,530
This is the first country to successfully make bipedal
robots.

4919
05:00:37,230 --> 05:00:39,170
They're still the best in the field of robotics.

4920
05:00:40,810 --> 05:00:43,430
And Japanese cartoons played some part in that?

4921
05:00:43,870 --> 05:00:44,390
They did.

4922
05:00:44,510 --> 05:00:45,070
They did.

4923
05:00:45,410 --> 05:00:47,950
I didn't get into science to make nuclear weapons, you know.

4924
05:00:48,070 --> 05:00:49,390
I just wanted to make robots.

4925
05:00:49,670 --> 05:00:50,950
Yeah, that's what all scientists.

4926
05:00:50,950 --> 05:00:53,610
Why are we zooming in on them?

4927
05:00:54,230 --> 05:00:54,750
Stop.

4928
05:00:55,950 --> 05:00:58,210
The product placement is too obvious now.

4929
05:00:58,870 --> 05:00:59,870
Stop it.

4930
05:01:00,630 --> 05:01:00,950
Stop it.

4931
05:01:01,650 --> 05:01:01,930
Really?

4932
05:01:02,290 --> 05:01:02,730
It's true.

4933
05:01:03,410 --> 05:01:04,550
It sounds like an excuse to me.

4934
05:01:04,550 --> 05:01:05,350
We get it!

4935
05:01:05,950 --> 05:01:07,430
This is on the GameCube.

4936
05:01:09,130 --> 05:01:09,650
You're right.

4937
05:01:10,450 --> 05:01:11,890
We have to take responsibility.

4938
05:01:12,150 --> 05:01:13,370
Bad love equals beat out equals boys.

4939
05:01:13,370 --> 05:01:15,150
Science has progressed because there is war.

4940
05:01:15,750 --> 05:01:19,190
And because of scientists' greed, weapons of mass
destruction were born.

4941
05:01:19,450 --> 05:01:20,510
But you're not greedy, Otacon.

4942
05:01:20,770 --> 05:01:21,650
But that's all over.

4943
05:01:21,890 --> 05:01:22,790
You just want to make robots.

4944
05:01:22,810 --> 05:01:25,070
I won't take part in murder anymore.

4945
05:01:25,230 --> 05:01:25,650
Yeah.

4946
05:01:26,250 --> 05:01:27,270
You're a good boy.

4947
05:01:27,510 --> 05:01:28,610
Good guy, Otacon.

4948
05:01:31,970 --> 05:01:38,630
whatever all I want from you is information sure I know
everything about this whole why you got to touch him like

4949
05:01:38,630 --> 05:01:46,470
that though ask me anything about Rex or about this place
also with this stealth camouflage I can sneak in and out of

4950
05:01:46,470 --> 05:01:52,370
the armory in mess hall if you need ammo or rations just
tell me and I'll bring them to you uh-huh yeah I know you

4951
05:01:52,370 --> 05:01:56,710
will I'm on frequency 141.12 one four one

4952
05:02:04,670 --> 05:02:06,590
Otacon looks like my uncle?

4953
05:02:07,210 --> 05:02:08,390
You have a hot uncle then.

4954
05:02:12,910 --> 05:02:13,510
Yippee!

4955
05:02:17,250 --> 05:02:18,730
Did he change his pants?

4956
05:02:19,390 --> 05:02:21,690
I don't think he did.

4957
05:02:23,430 --> 05:02:26,470
Why do they give you bullets in this if...

4958
05:02:26,470 --> 05:02:28,070
Like can you actually shoot Grey Fox?

4959
05:02:29,270 --> 05:02:30,510
I've always just punched him.

4960
05:02:30,530 --> 05:02:32,770
him to death it's

4961
05:02:40,570 --> 05:02:46,150
clean he must drink a lot of water oh

4962
05:02:50,970 --> 05:03:09,330
my gosh that looks similar to the controller i'm using now
wowie it's a game cube wait can i shoot this thing oh sorry

4963
05:03:09,330 --> 05:03:19,110
pencil Yoshi.

4964
05:03:19,610 --> 05:03:19,730
Yoshi!

4965
05:03:22,450 --> 05:03:23,390
Goodbye, Mario.

4966
05:03:27,270 --> 05:03:28,790
Oh no!

4967
05:03:29,130 --> 05:03:31,850
Why did my life show up?

4968
05:03:32,390 --> 05:03:32,830
Yoshi!

4969
05:03:36,470 --> 05:03:36,870
Yoshi!

4970
05:03:39,530 --> 05:03:40,490
So cute!

4971
05:03:41,650 --> 05:03:41,650
So

4972
05:03:47,910 --> 05:03:49,510
cute!

4973
05:03:51,750 --> 05:03:53,450
Does Mario heal you?

4974
05:03:53,570 --> 05:03:54,150
No way!

4975
05:03:54,450 --> 05:03:56,070
Does Mario heal you?

4976
05:03:56,310 --> 05:03:57,610
Is that why it says...

4977
05:03:57,610 --> 05:04:00,110
That one makes sense.

4978
05:04:02,350 --> 05:04:03,310
What's this?

4979
05:04:03,810 --> 05:04:05,570
Oh, it's the...

4980
05:04:05,570 --> 05:04:07,310
That's so funny.

4981
05:04:11,190 --> 05:04:12,570
Wait, what's on this computer?

4982
05:04:13,110 --> 05:04:14,510
Actually, I think he destroyed this computer.

4983
05:04:14,930 --> 05:04:15,850
Oh, no, he didn't.

4984
05:04:17,130 --> 05:04:17,750
Accessing?

4985
05:04:17,950 --> 05:04:18,350
Port?

4986
05:04:19,390 --> 05:04:20,170
Some of those of them.

4987
05:04:21,130 --> 05:04:21,610
Can't tell.

4988
05:04:24,450 --> 05:04:26,490
in here, so much science.

4989
05:04:28,370 --> 05:04:29,730
I want the box.

4990
05:04:35,000 --> 05:04:35,820
Let's go.

4991
05:04:40,530 --> 05:04:42,970
Let's save real quick.

4992
05:04:43,590 --> 05:04:43,930
Maybe.

4993
05:04:45,450 --> 05:04:47,490
Snake, there's an old Chinese saying.

4994
05:04:48,070 --> 05:04:52,570
A scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be
deemed a scholar.

4995
05:04:53,410 --> 05:04:54,630
Einstein said it another way.

4996
05:04:55,070 --> 05:04:57,910
He said that only a life lived for others is worth living.

4997
05:04:58,630 --> 05:05:06,010
that's why i entered mit instead of cmu or princeton like my
friends boo princeton physics not just theoretical stuff

4998
05:05:06,010 --> 05:05:12,250
yeah i wanted to make things for people we wanted we wanted
to do real stuff or the codec system you're so awesome

4999
05:05:12,250 --> 05:05:18,770
maling i just wanted to make something that would be useful
for people yeah i think that it was the same for dr emirate

5000
05:05:18,770 --> 05:05:27,550
too no but he was used like a tool used to make a horrible
killing machine just like snake used by everybody it would

5001
05:05:27,550 --> 05:05:28,370
As a machine.

5002
05:05:28,970 --> 05:05:29,570
As a weapon.

5003
05:05:30,370 --> 05:05:32,310
I don't know.

5004
05:05:32,450 --> 05:05:32,850
No.

5005
05:05:33,470 --> 05:05:33,550
No.

5006
05:05:33,550 --> 05:05:34,090
You're wrong.

5007
05:05:34,730 --> 05:05:38,110
There's at least one person whose life has gotten better as
a result of your inventions.

5008
05:05:40,530 --> 05:05:42,810
Without the Kodak, I wouldn't be able to talk to you like
this.

5009
05:05:43,770 --> 05:05:44,490
Thanks, Snake.

5010
05:05:44,950 --> 05:05:45,330
Aww.

5011
05:05:45,990 --> 05:05:46,550
Aww.

5012
05:05:49,070 --> 05:05:49,630
Wee.

5013
05:05:52,750 --> 05:05:53,810
So sweet.

5014
05:05:55,850 --> 05:05:59,110
So sweet.

5015
05:05:59,690 --> 05:05:59,910
Oh.

5016
05:06:00,790 --> 05:06:02,590
Actually, I forgot.

5017
05:06:04,170 --> 05:06:05,550
I want to see if she still does this.

5018
05:06:06,050 --> 05:06:06,550
Do not save.

5019
05:06:06,690 --> 05:06:07,270
Good luck, Snake.

5020
05:06:07,630 --> 05:06:08,310
Thanks, Mealing.

5021
05:06:10,930 --> 05:06:11,850
What's up, Snake?

5022
05:06:13,310 --> 05:06:14,290
Good luck, Snake.

5023
05:06:14,550 --> 05:06:15,130
Thank you.

5024
05:06:18,110 --> 05:06:19,750
What can I do for you, Snake?

5025
05:06:20,730 --> 05:06:21,610
Come on, Snake.

5026
05:06:21,750 --> 05:06:21,910
I just want to look at your snake.

5027
05:06:21,910 --> 05:06:22,970
Don't call me for no reason.

5028
05:06:23,110 --> 05:06:24,310
I just want to look at your pretty face.

5029
05:06:25,770 --> 05:06:26,930
She gets upset.

5030
05:06:34,290 --> 05:06:36,190
She's so cute.

5031
05:06:37,690 --> 05:06:39,250
Oh, she's upset at me.

5032
05:06:41,110 --> 05:06:42,470
Oh, maybe one more time.

5033
05:06:43,790 --> 05:06:44,630
I love the squint.

5034
05:06:51,090 --> 05:06:53,310
She really said.

5035
05:06:57,550 --> 05:06:58,110
Babe.

5036
05:07:01,850 --> 05:07:02,330
Cute.

5037
05:07:07,010 --> 05:07:09,730
Well, it looks like you've rescued Emmerich for the time
being.

5038
05:07:11,170 --> 05:07:14,150
With that stealth camouflage, he should be able to hide
safely.

5039
05:07:15,130 --> 05:07:15,990
Grey Fox.

5040
05:07:16,810 --> 05:07:17,790
I can't believe it.

5041
05:07:18,770 --> 05:07:20,510
But the real problem is your niece.

5042
05:07:21,310 --> 05:07:22,290
She's a problem.

5043
05:07:22,670 --> 05:07:24,230
She was supposed to be a good girl.

5044
05:07:24,430 --> 05:07:25,690
Something must have happened to her.

5045
05:07:25,750 --> 05:07:26,810
Why wasn't she a good girl?

5046
05:07:27,970 --> 05:07:28,890
Shut up, Naomi.

5047
05:07:29,230 --> 05:07:29,370
Not exactly.

5048
05:07:30,110 --> 05:07:31,510
It's just that she's holding the detonator.

5049
05:07:31,530 --> 05:07:36,650
nation code override oh i just thought you were human for a
second there are last chance of stopping that nuclear launch

5050
05:07:36,650 --> 05:07:42,050
my mistake you're a cold man your mission is more important
than the life of your companions you're a cold man this is

5051
05:07:42,050 --> 05:07:51,490
war survival is the name of the game sometimes you have to
be called to survive yes but snake either way i want you to

5052
05:07:51,490 --> 05:08:00,130
find merrill as soon as possible i understand it is kind of
bad that he said that in front of campbell i feel like in

5053
05:08:00,130 --> 05:08:12,410
front of the little you know Merrill no response let's try
master more in war a split second can mean the difference

5054
05:08:12,410 --> 05:08:20,570
between victory and defeat don't ever hesitate the slower
you react the greater the chance that you'll be beaten why

5055
05:08:20,570 --> 05:08:28,750
does he sound out of breath did you hear that he was like in
war the every second counts don't think

5056
05:08:32,150 --> 05:08:34,250
Don't waste any second.

5057
05:08:36,250 --> 05:08:36,650
Why did...

5058
05:08:36,650 --> 05:08:38,170
Are you okay, Master Miller?

5059
05:08:38,330 --> 05:08:39,570
Are you on the treadmill or something?

5060
05:08:40,050 --> 05:08:42,990
That inner voice that warns you when danger is nearby?

5061
05:08:43,750 --> 05:08:45,210
You can't learn that in training.

5062
05:08:45,870 --> 05:08:48,010
You've got to have survived a few firefights.

5063
05:08:48,530 --> 05:08:52,110
Seen a few friends blown away before you learned that trick.

5064
05:08:52,450 --> 05:08:54,270
He sounds so like breathy.

5065
05:08:54,450 --> 05:08:55,550
I don't understand why.

5066
05:08:56,230 --> 05:08:56,630
Alright, guys.

5067
05:08:56,750 --> 05:08:59,650
Before we continue onwards, I'm going to go...

5068
05:09:02,390 --> 05:09:03,830
set my oven.

5069
05:09:04,070 --> 05:09:09,530
I'm going to turn on my oven and I'm going to set an alarm
for like five minutes or something or I'll do like 10

5070
05:09:09,530 --> 05:09:19,270
minutes and then um and then um go put my pizza in the oven
so I can have some food.

5071
05:09:20,990 --> 05:09:22,410
Bro is getting back shots.

5072
05:09:22,690 --> 05:09:26,250
Well back shots while on the wait what's a back shot?

5073
05:09:33,030 --> 05:09:34,570
And what time is it?

5074
05:09:37,650 --> 05:09:39,590
Let's set it for 9...

5075
05:09:39,590 --> 05:09:40,510
No, that's not...

5076
05:09:40,510 --> 05:09:42,930
Let's set it for 9.05.

5077
05:09:45,830 --> 05:09:46,630
Thank you!

5078
05:09:48,150 --> 05:09:48,450
Yeah.

5079
05:09:49,450 --> 05:09:50,110
Oh, not AM?

5080
05:09:50,270 --> 05:09:50,730
No, no, no.

5081
05:09:50,890 --> 05:09:51,550
PM, PM.

5082
05:09:52,370 --> 05:09:54,830
Okay, set for...

5083
05:09:54,830 --> 05:09:55,930
9 minutes from now.

5084
05:09:56,010 --> 05:09:56,530
Oh, wait.

5085
05:09:56,750 --> 05:09:58,170
Let me set it a little...

5086
05:09:58,170 --> 05:10:00,310
It should heat up in like 10 minutes, alright?

5087
05:10:00,470 --> 05:10:01,370
Okay, I'll be right back.

Pizza.

5094
05:11:10,690 --> 05:11:11,170
Bashamine!

5095
05:11:12,510 --> 05:11:13,310
Oh, hiya!

5096
05:11:15,510 --> 05:11:18,550
Backshots are when you throw your ball backwards towards the
hoop.

5097
05:11:19,370 --> 05:11:20,350
No need to look it up now.

5098
05:11:20,490 --> 05:11:20,750
You're welcome.

5099
05:11:21,490 --> 05:11:24,310
Oh, so it's like a basketball thing.

5100
05:11:25,530 --> 05:11:26,690
Makes... Well, he's...

5101
05:11:26,690 --> 05:11:27,110
Oh, my God.

5102
05:11:27,590 --> 05:11:29,010
Master Miller's shooting the hoops.

5103
05:11:29,570 --> 05:11:30,370
On the job?

5104
05:11:32,430 --> 05:11:34,510
Master Miller...

5105
05:11:34,510 --> 05:11:35,570
Pay attention to me.

5106
05:11:38,150 --> 05:11:41,270
Okay, the way you guys are describing it is making me
scared.

5107
05:11:41,510 --> 05:11:42,770
I'm just gonna believe whatever.

5108
05:11:43,150 --> 05:11:43,570
Whatever.

5109
05:11:44,110 --> 05:11:47,230
Let's listen to Sasha instead.

5110
05:11:49,050 --> 05:11:55,330
Otacon said that now it's possible to design and test new
types of nuclear weapons in a virtual simulation without

5111
05:11:55,330 --> 05:11:56,750
ever exploding a nuclear device.

5112
05:11:56,870 --> 05:11:57,610
What kind of pizza is this?

5113
05:11:57,630 --> 05:11:58,650
It's just cheese pizza.

5114
05:11:58,990 --> 05:11:59,730
Yes, it's true.

5115
05:12:00,410 --> 05:12:07,710
Since the establishment of Dart, a dual-axis radiographic
hydrodynamic test facility and NIF, the national ignition

5116
05:12:07,710 --> 05:12:14,810
facility early in the 21st century there's been a wealth of
data concerning nuclear fission and fusion fission and

5117
05:12:14,810 --> 05:12:20,590
fusion there is also much data accumulated from the nuclear
tests conducted over the last four decades with the

5118
05:12:20,590 --> 05:12:26,890
processing speed of today's supercomputers they can design a
new nuclear weapon through virtual reality computer

5119
05:12:26,890 --> 05:12:39,630
simulations mint are you going to do a full run in one
setting no no I think maybe after psychomantis maybe since

5120
05:12:39,630 --> 05:12:49,810
he's coming up relatively soon right yeah we go to
psychomanus then we go through to we'll see oh i went the

5121
05:12:49,810 --> 05:12:53,970
wrong way um maybe after psychomanus

5122
05:12:57,030 --> 05:13:04,110
and then i'll probably do the rest of it next week i'll

5123
05:13:11,430 --> 05:13:13,930
i don't know we'll see Mm-hmm.

5124
05:13:15,850 --> 05:13:16,250
Oh, nice.

5125
05:13:16,530 --> 05:13:17,190
Everything's still broken.

5126
05:13:18,610 --> 05:13:26,930
Uh, Otacon gave me his his stuff, right?

5127
05:13:27,130 --> 05:13:27,910
His card?

5128
05:13:28,070 --> 05:13:29,630
What card key do I have now?

5129
05:13:31,250 --> 05:13:31,670
Four.

5130
05:13:33,430 --> 05:13:35,450
Metal Gear Exercise Data.

5131
05:13:36,470 --> 05:13:37,510
Number four.

5132
05:13:39,050 --> 05:13:39,770
Number four.

5133
05:13:48,790 --> 05:13:50,670
Was there four over here?

5134
05:13:52,270 --> 05:13:52,850
Bip-bip!

5135
05:13:54,230 --> 05:13:54,990
Did I go in here before?

5136
05:13:55,350 --> 05:13:55,450
Oh.

5137
05:13:56,270 --> 05:13:56,410
Oh.

5138
05:13:57,090 --> 05:13:57,430
Oh.

5139
05:14:02,270 --> 05:14:03,390
Nakita bullet full.

5140
05:14:04,630 --> 05:14:06,170
I think I went in this one before already.

5141
05:14:06,590 --> 05:14:06,930
And I just...

5142
05:14:06,930 --> 05:14:07,030
Oh!

5143
05:14:07,690 --> 05:14:08,790
Night vision goggles!

5144
05:14:09,210 --> 05:14:09,450
What?

5145
05:14:09,550 --> 05:14:10,390
How did I miss that?

5146
05:14:11,050 --> 05:14:13,010
Wait, how did I actually miss that before?

5147
05:14:14,910 --> 05:14:15,870
It's kind of crazy.

5148
05:14:17,210 --> 05:14:17,950
Oh, uh oh.

5149
05:14:18,310 --> 05:14:19,330
Oh, how do I get out of here?

5150
05:14:20,290 --> 05:14:22,070
Run, snake, run!

5151
05:14:23,270 --> 05:14:24,630
Go, go, go!

5152
05:14:27,470 --> 05:14:29,210
Oh, level four door.

5153
05:14:30,430 --> 05:14:32,330
Okay, that makes way more sense.

5154
05:14:32,930 --> 05:14:35,390
I was gonna say, I thought there was a door that we could...

5155
05:14:36,730 --> 05:14:37,190
Okay.

5156
05:14:38,210 --> 05:14:38,530
Oh.

5157
05:14:39,870 --> 05:14:40,830
B1, baby.

5158
05:14:45,660 --> 05:14:46,540
Where are cameras?

5159
05:14:46,680 --> 05:14:47,860
I shot them down.

5160
05:14:48,020 --> 05:14:49,140
I shot them down.

5161
05:14:53,870 --> 05:14:56,430
Okay, I'm gonna try and hold up the guy going

5162
05:15:02,500 --> 05:15:14,450
to the bathroom.

5163
05:15:27,060 --> 05:15:30,100
Now pee without using your hands.

5164
05:15:40,510 --> 05:15:42,750
I don't need any more rations right now.

5165
05:15:56,950 --> 05:15:57,530
But you're like...

5166
05:15:57,530 --> 05:15:59,090
Ew, why is that in the stall?

5167
05:16:00,530 --> 05:16:02,070
That's nasty.

5168
05:16:02,710 --> 05:16:03,430
Okay, come in.

5169
05:16:06,550 --> 05:16:08,030
Get in there.

5170
05:16:10,030 --> 05:16:10,110
Yep.

5171
05:16:10,790 --> 05:16:11,130
Good night.

5172
05:16:12,630 --> 05:16:12,870
Uh-oh.

5173
05:16:13,410 --> 05:16:14,490
Uh-uh.

5174
05:16:15,130 --> 05:16:15,410
Uh-oh.

5175
05:16:22,050 --> 05:16:22,570
Oh.

5176
05:16:22,850 --> 05:16:23,810
Oh my god.

5177
05:16:24,350 --> 05:16:26,790
Oh, I didn't realize that.

5178
05:16:28,990 --> 05:16:29,250
Um.

5179
05:16:31,790 --> 05:16:32,210
Freeze.

5180
05:16:36,960 --> 05:16:40,140
You're also going in the stall.

5181
05:16:43,300 --> 05:16:43,680
Pizza time?

5182
05:16:44,040 --> 05:16:44,940
What do you mean, pizza time?

5183
05:16:46,280 --> 05:16:47,860
My alarm hasn't gone off yet.

5184
05:16:52,220 --> 05:16:53,320
You guys are set an alarm.

5185
05:16:54,500 --> 05:16:55,020
Get in there.

5186
05:17:01,460 --> 05:17:03,860
This is where Psycho Mantis is.

5187
05:17:03,980 --> 05:17:05,820
Oh, I was like, what are those two dots?

5188
05:17:06,440 --> 05:17:10,320
But it's a It's our friendly, it's our little guys.

5189
05:17:11,340 --> 05:17:15,550
We can't go into the girl's room, unfortunately.

5190
05:17:15,790 --> 05:17:16,210
Oh, wait.

5191
05:17:19,970 --> 05:17:20,590
Is that her?

5192
05:17:26,590 --> 05:17:27,070
Easy.

5193
05:17:31,350 --> 05:17:33,530
Wow, the bathroom got, like, such an upgrade.

5194
05:17:33,770 --> 05:17:34,750
Oh, my gosh.

5195
05:17:35,250 --> 05:17:36,550
It's so nice.

5196
05:17:37,430 --> 05:17:39,570
There's a little place to do your makeup.

5197
05:17:41,290 --> 05:17:43,310
It's so fancy in here now.

5198
05:17:44,130 --> 05:17:44,130
I don't

5199
05:17:48,190 --> 05:17:51,370
have the toilet paper on the floor.

5200
05:17:51,550 --> 05:17:52,590
That's disgusting.

5201
05:18:00,310 --> 05:18:00,850
Freeze.

5202
05:18:02,390 --> 05:18:02,930
You.

5203
05:18:03,290 --> 05:18:03,490
You trickster.

5204
05:18:04,130 --> 05:18:04,950
You trickster.

5205
05:18:06,530 --> 05:18:07,950
I let my guard down because you're beautiful.

5206
05:18:08,290 --> 05:18:11,270
That's the second time I've been able to sneak up on the
legendary solid snake.

5207
05:18:11,330 --> 05:18:12,170
What a peeper.

5208
05:18:12,730 --> 05:18:13,050
Ow!

5209
05:18:14,510 --> 05:18:15,010
Oh!

5210
05:18:16,790 --> 05:18:16,850
Oh!

5211
05:18:16,850 --> 05:18:17,370
Oh!

5212
05:18:17,810 --> 05:18:18,170
Oh!

5213
05:18:18,190 --> 05:18:31,630
you're Meryl you're hot oh no wait my alarm oh no no hold on
oh gosh what do you mean hey men aren't allowed in here hold

5214
05:18:31,630 --> 05:18:42,310
on I gotta get to the cutscene I had no idea you were so
feminine this is no time to try and hit on me snake she has

5215
05:18:42,310 --> 05:18:48,790
psychosis besides it's a waste of time exactly when I joined
up Psychotherapy.

5216
05:18:49,350 --> 05:18:49,490
Psychotherapy.

5217
05:18:50,610 --> 05:18:50,870
Yeah.

5218
05:18:51,430 --> 05:18:52,250
Same smart mouth.

5219
05:18:52,550 --> 05:18:53,510
You're Merrill, all right.

5220
05:18:54,110 --> 05:18:54,570
Are you hurt?

5221
05:18:54,850 --> 05:18:55,290
Pizza time.

5222
05:18:55,530 --> 05:18:55,790
Not yet.

5223
05:18:56,570 --> 05:18:58,890
After all, I was disguised as a genome soldier.

5224
05:18:59,970 --> 05:19:00,910
So why'd you change?

5225
05:19:01,210 --> 05:19:03,230
You'd be a lot better off dressed like one of them.

5226
05:19:03,830 --> 05:19:05,870
I got tired of disguising myself.

5227
05:19:06,050 --> 05:19:06,670
Rip pizza?

5228
05:19:07,070 --> 05:19:08,910
No, it's just, uh, it's just the oven.

5229
05:19:10,150 --> 05:19:11,650
I gotta go put the pizza inside.

5230
05:19:11,830 --> 05:19:13,450
The uniform smelled like blood.

5231
05:19:13,870 --> 05:19:14,290
Ew.

5232
05:19:14,450 --> 05:19:15,290
What's that mark?

5233
05:19:15,730 --> 05:19:16,420
What is this music?

5234
05:19:16,870 --> 05:19:17,690
Oh, this?

5235
05:19:18,490 --> 05:19:19,690
It's a paint tattoo.

5236
05:19:20,210 --> 05:19:20,830
It's not real.

5237
05:19:21,690 --> 05:19:25,670
I'm a fan of Foxhound way back when guys like you and my
uncle were in it.

5238
05:19:25,930 --> 05:19:27,750
This is a weird soundtrack.

5239
05:19:28,010 --> 05:19:30,210
None of that gene therapy like there is today.

5240
05:19:31,230 --> 05:19:32,870
You guys were real heroes.

5241
05:19:33,990 --> 05:19:35,690
There are no heroes in war.

5242
05:19:35,810 --> 05:19:36,450
It's funny you mention that.

5243
05:19:36,450 --> 05:19:39,550
All heroes I know are either dead or in prison.

5244
05:19:40,290 --> 05:19:40,990
One or the other.

5245
05:19:41,890 --> 05:19:46,610
But Snake, her foundation does not match the rest of her
body.

5246
05:19:49,390 --> 05:19:51,170
She looks like...

5247
05:19:51,170 --> 05:19:53,810
I'm just a guy who can only find meaning on the battlefield.

5248
05:19:54,410 --> 05:19:56,530
There's no winning or losing for a mercenary.

5249
05:19:56,910 --> 05:19:59,450
The only winners in war are the people.

5250
05:20:00,890 --> 05:20:01,410
That's right.

5251
05:20:01,810 --> 05:20:02,930
And you fight for the people.

5252
05:20:02,950 --> 05:20:05,170
She thinks she's way paler than she actually is.

5253
05:20:05,190 --> 05:20:06,210
I've never fought for anyone but myself.

5254
05:20:07,090 --> 05:20:08,330
I've got no purpose in life.

5255
05:20:08,930 --> 05:20:10,050
No ultimate goal.

5256
05:20:10,930 --> 05:20:12,770
I don't like the music yet.

5257
05:20:13,330 --> 05:20:13,570
Come on.

5258
05:20:14,310 --> 05:20:16,770
It's only when I'm cheating death on the battlefield.

5259
05:20:17,690 --> 05:20:23,370
I feel truly alive Truly alive seeing other people die makes
you feel alive, huh?

5260
05:20:23,530 --> 05:20:28,810
I mean you can't stop loving war Is it the same for all
soldiers throughout history?

5261
05:20:29,050 --> 05:20:31,410
No interest in men yet marries the toilet man?

5262
05:20:32,230 --> 05:20:34,010
Hey, he was very convincing.

5263
05:20:34,050 --> 05:20:35,110
Why didn't you contact me?

5264
05:20:35,990 --> 05:20:36,670
Yeah, actually.

5265
05:20:37,250 --> 05:20:37,950
Oh my god.

5266
05:20:38,230 --> 05:20:38,470
Oh my god.

5267
05:20:39,110 --> 05:20:40,050
Oh, your shoes.

5268
05:20:40,370 --> 05:20:44,870
Oh my god, not in the bathroom Shouldn't you just be happy
we met up like this girly please.

5269
05:20:45,270 --> 05:20:45,950
Oh my god.

5270
05:20:46,350 --> 05:20:57,130
You're no so nasty oh anyway how did you recognize me in
disguise you got a nice never forget a lady so there's

5271
05:20:57,130 --> 05:21:08,810

what oh i see first it's my eyes now it's my butt what's

5272
05:21:08,810 --> 05:21:13,590
next on the battlefield you never think about what's next
angle

5273
05:21:17,690 --> 05:21:18,410
Love it.

5274
05:21:18,870 --> 05:21:19,230
Love that.

5275
05:21:19,730 --> 05:21:20,890
Love that for you, Snake.

5276
05:21:22,930 --> 05:21:24,690
I miss this guy.

5277
05:21:25,470 --> 05:21:27,890
So, Snake, how are the negotiations going?

5278
05:21:28,930 --> 05:21:29,690
No progress.

5279
05:21:30,450 --> 05:21:30,650
Negotiations?

5280
05:21:30,810 --> 05:21:32,090
So it's all up to you, huh?

5281
05:21:33,970 --> 05:21:36,710
Somebody's got to stop them from launching a nuclear
missile.

5282
05:21:37,670 --> 05:21:38,570
There are two ways.

5283
05:21:39,070 --> 05:21:41,430
Either we destroy Metal Gear or...

5284
05:21:41,430 --> 05:21:43,510
We override the detonation code.

5285
05:21:44,410 --> 05:21:46,130
You got the card keys from Baker?

5286
05:21:49,190 --> 05:21:56,050
Hi You mean this way was that where are the others there
should be three keys?

5287
05:21:56,670 --> 05:22:00,950
This is all I've got Where could the other two be?

5288
05:22:01,130 --> 05:22:08,790
I have no idea but they must be somewhere if we can't find
them We'll have no choice but to destroy metal here ladies

5289
05:22:08,790 --> 05:22:15,330
on this whole I heard that metal gears and another ladies
washroom floor is pretty clear take me to I know this place

5290
05:22:15,330 --> 05:22:22,630

have enough battle experience i won't slow you down i

5291
05:22:22,630 --> 05:22:32,250

down then you can shoot me wow i don't like to waste bullets

5292
05:22:33,410 --> 05:22:40,270
none of that gene therapy nonsense you guys are real heroes
woman who goes in all in on nanos a few years later okay to

5293
05:22:40,270 --> 05:22:48,290
be fair it's like 10 years later so spoilers sorry sorry
sorry sorry sorry Sorry.

5294
05:22:48,950 --> 05:22:49,430
Sorry.

5295
05:22:49,610 --> 05:22:49,990
No spoilers.

5296
05:22:50,130 --> 05:22:50,490
No spoilers.

5297
05:22:50,670 --> 05:22:50,770
No spoilers.

5298
05:22:50,990 --> 05:22:51,390
Got it.

5299
05:22:51,670 --> 05:22:52,530
I'll be careful.

5300
05:22:58,090 --> 05:23:01,970
You know, I don't use makeup the way other women do.

5301
05:23:02,190 --> 05:23:03,970
No, you don't because it looks very bad.

5302
05:23:04,370 --> 05:23:05,650
I hardly ever look at myself in the mirror.

5303
05:23:05,930 --> 05:23:07,310
Maybe you should look more.

5304
05:23:08,350 --> 05:23:10,530
Because, oh no, she's not like other girls.

5305
05:23:10,530 --> 05:23:12,350
I've always dreamed of becoming a soldier.

5306
05:23:14,830 --> 05:23:15,790
Your foundation.

5307
05:23:16,770 --> 05:23:18,510
It wasn't really my dream.

5308
05:23:19,390 --> 05:23:31,190
My father he was killed in action when I was younger You
wanted to follow in your father's footsteps Not really I

5309
05:23:31,190 --> 05:23:37,950
thought that if I became a soldier, I could understand him
better And it looks good here you became a soldier looks

5310
05:23:37,950 --> 05:23:47,510
like she tries to blend it in with her neck at least I
Thought I was until today Now I understand Truth is I was

5311
05:23:47,510 --> 05:23:52,390
just afraid of looking at myself Afraid of having to make my
own decisions in life.

5312
05:23:52,690 --> 05:23:54,270
I'm so sad about the music change.

5313
05:23:54,410 --> 05:23:56,430
But I'm not gonna lie to myself anymore.

5314
05:23:56,810 --> 05:23:57,470
I'll do it myself.

5315
05:23:57,810 --> 05:24:00,330
It's time I took a long, hard look at myself.

5316
05:24:02,810 --> 05:24:05,490
I want to know who I am, what I'm capable of.

5317
05:24:06,030 --> 05:24:08,990
I want to know why I've lived the way I've lived until now.

5318
05:24:10,390 --> 05:24:12,730
I want to know...

5319
05:24:12,730 --> 05:24:13,930
Take a good look.

5320
05:24:14,390 --> 05:24:16,150
You won't be seeing mirrors for a while.

5321
05:24:16,670 --> 05:24:18,790
There won't be any chances to wash your face either.

5322
05:24:19,350 --> 05:24:20,370
No, your foundation.

5323
05:24:22,690 --> 05:24:24,470
This isn't a training exercise.

5324
05:24:24,810 --> 05:24:26,510
Our lives are riding on this.

5325
05:24:26,770 --> 05:24:26,950
Yeah.

5326
05:24:27,150 --> 05:24:28,910
There are no heroes or heroines.

5327
05:24:29,230 --> 05:24:29,330
No.

5328
05:24:29,470 --> 05:24:30,030
You lose.

5329
05:24:30,530 --> 05:24:31,730
You die a dog's death.

5330
05:24:31,830 --> 05:24:32,990
A dog's death.

5331
05:24:33,790 --> 05:24:33,910
Yeah.

5332
05:24:37,310 --> 05:24:38,870
Is that Fama's functional?

5333
05:24:39,210 --> 05:24:39,390
Oh.

5334
05:24:40,150 --> 05:24:41,230
I have one, too.

5335
05:24:41,990 --> 05:24:43,450
Unfortunately, it's out of ammo.

5336
05:24:43,810 --> 05:24:43,970
Oh.

5337
05:24:44,270 --> 05:24:45,690
Where'd you get that desert eagle?

5338
05:24:47,570 --> 05:24:49,050
I found it in the armory.

5339
05:24:49,910 --> 05:24:50,190
Ah!

5340
05:24:50,330 --> 05:24:50,690
It's a...

5341
05:24:50,710 --> 05:25:00,390
50 caliber action express there was a so calm pistol too but
I chose this like give us the leftovers so I got a leftover

5342
05:25:00,390 --> 05:25:12,310
huh isn't that gun a little big for a girl hey snake now you
treat me like a woman come on use my 45 I want the she's

5343
05:25:12,310 --> 05:25:18,230
like give me that bigger guy I've used a gun like this since
I was eight years old I'm more comfortable with it than I am

5344
05:25:18,230 --> 05:25:23,190
with a bra whoa Yes, Snake.

5345
05:25:23,190 --> 05:25:26,530
If we're gonna go north, we'll have to go through the
commander's room on this floor.

5346
05:25:27,450 --> 05:25:29,510
The overland route is blocked by glaciers.

5347
05:25:30,610 --> 05:25:32,850
The door to the commander's room is security level 5.

5348
05:25:33,450 --> 05:25:34,390
But you got the key.

5349
05:25:35,390 --> 05:25:36,490
This card will open it.

5350
05:25:36,670 --> 05:25:37,450
Ah, yeah.

5351
05:25:37,550 --> 05:25:39,610
Why does this like lighting on Snake's face?

5352
05:25:39,730 --> 05:25:40,810
Looks like he's got like a lightning bolt.

5353
05:25:40,810 --> 05:25:42,890
It was inside the pocket of the uniform I was wearing.

5354
05:25:43,350 --> 05:25:43,570
Nice.

5355
05:25:43,730 --> 05:25:46,150
It looks like he must have been guarding someplace
important.

5356
05:25:46,450 --> 05:25:47,250
Could have used that earlier.

5357
05:25:47,610 --> 05:25:48,450
Okay, let's go.

5358
05:25:48,970 --> 05:25:50,550
I know this place better than you.

5359
05:25:50,710 --> 05:25:51,950
I'll be point, man.

5360
05:25:52,730 --> 05:25:53,030
Follow me.

5361
05:25:54,410 --> 05:25:54,530
Oh.

5362
05:25:55,170 --> 05:25:55,690
She's going.

5363
05:25:55,890 --> 05:25:56,570
She's running.

5364
05:26:02,640 --> 05:26:04,480
Why is he in Australia?

5365
05:26:08,280 --> 05:26:09,880
What happened to the music?

5366
05:26:10,760 --> 05:26:11,500
I'll keep a lookout.

5367
05:26:11,900 --> 05:26:13,020
Make sure you're ready, okay?

5368
05:26:13,140 --> 05:26:14,620
What happened to the music?

5369
05:26:19,300 --> 05:26:21,220
Okay, give me one second.

5370
05:26:24,000 --> 05:26:32,960
the codec real quick um i'm gonna go put my pizza in the
oven so then uh we'll run around and then um we'll wait a

5371
05:26:32,960 --> 05:26:37,020
little bit until my pizza's cooked because it shouldn't take
too long it should take like 10 minutes and i don't want to

5372
05:26:37,020 --> 05:26:44,920
be in the middle of mantis's fight when when uh it goes off
so give me sorry i know i keep leaving um but give me like

5373
05:26:44,920 --> 05:26:49,380
you know two minutes to put it into the oven and yeah i'll
be right back

5374
05:28:16,950 --> 05:28:19,950
All right, let me set a timer for, oh, yeah.

5375
05:28:20,390 --> 05:28:25,330
Let me set a timer for 10 minutes.

5376
05:28:26,810 --> 05:28:30,710
Thank you for all the super ties, thank you, thank you.

5377
05:28:31,630 --> 05:28:33,990
10 minutes would be 25.

5378
05:28:36,130 --> 05:28:37,110
Okay, save.

5379
05:28:37,970 --> 05:28:38,090
Okay.

5380
05:28:38,950 --> 05:28:41,270
All right, let's grab some stuff.

5381
05:28:41,790 --> 05:28:44,730
Actually, let's, we can call the codec first.

5382
05:28:46,870 --> 05:28:56,990
is fine thank goodness thank goodness we can't relax not yet
no i know snake uh she's quite a woman as commander of this

5383
05:28:56,990 --> 05:29:06,310
operation i can't ask you to watch after merrill but duty
first maybe i was wrong sending my own flesh and blood to

5384
05:29:06,310 --> 05:29:13,230
war she understands about duty i know she does welcome back
but what i want to know is what was the real purpose of this

5385
05:29:13,230 --> 05:29:19,270
military exercise i don't know I'm nothing more than a
middleman.

5386
05:29:19,850 --> 05:29:22,130
Is this transmission being monitored by the military?

5387
05:29:22,670 --> 05:29:23,110
Of course.

5388
05:29:23,230 --> 05:29:23,970
I get it.

5389
05:29:24,410 --> 05:29:27,330
All the world's a stage and we're merely players, right?

5390
05:29:27,730 --> 05:29:28,210
Yes.

5391
05:29:28,870 --> 05:29:31,070
But even players can influence the play.

5392
05:29:31,690 --> 05:29:34,110
I just hope we can prevent it from having a bad ending.

5393
05:29:34,370 --> 05:29:34,570
Thanks for the beat.

5394
05:29:37,690 --> 05:29:39,270
What did I call Meryl?

5395
05:29:39,590 --> 05:29:40,090
She right there?

5396
05:29:40,410 --> 05:29:41,030
Oh, no response.

5397
05:29:41,130 --> 05:29:42,210
Come on, girlie.

5398
05:29:42,810 --> 05:29:43,610
Come on.

5399
05:29:47,910 --> 05:29:54,950
it you managed to link up with merrill yeah good so now you
must have the card keys that will override the detonation

5400
05:29:54,950 --> 05:30:02,610
yes we're gonna override that hurry the time limit is
running out oh my gosh we only probably have like two hours

5401
05:30:02,610 --> 05:30:14,870
see nastasha you found merrill the colonel will be so
relieved oh okay it's a good thing you hooked up with

5402
05:30:14,870 --> 05:30:20,510
merrill you should have seen the colonel He doesn't like to
let it show because he's the boss, but he was so happy he

5403
05:30:20,510 --> 05:30:21,650
could barely contain himself.

5404
05:30:21,650 --> 05:30:22,010
Oh, that's right.

5405
05:30:22,170 --> 05:30:23,030
Her codec is broken.

5406
05:30:23,330 --> 05:30:23,510
That's right.

5407
05:30:23,730 --> 05:30:23,990
You're right.

5408
05:30:24,190 --> 05:30:26,150
You're right.

5409
05:30:26,730 --> 05:30:28,550
Why did I keep saying hook up with her?

5410
05:30:29,690 --> 05:30:30,970
I don't really like the...

5411
05:30:30,970 --> 05:30:31,050
Oops.

5412
05:30:31,450 --> 05:30:33,590
I don't really like that wording.

5413
05:30:35,670 --> 05:30:36,050
Oh.

5414
05:30:40,440 --> 05:30:41,640
Talk to you later, Snake.

5415
05:30:42,160 --> 05:30:42,540
Bye.

5416
05:30:45,880 --> 05:30:46,280
Wait.

5417
05:30:46,400 --> 05:30:46,660
Wait.

5418
05:30:55,410 --> 05:30:56,750
I'm looking at you.

5419
05:30:57,350 --> 05:30:57,350
What?

5420
05:30:57,790 --> 05:30:58,550
What is it?

5421
05:31:02,390 --> 05:31:04,130
Oh, I almost punched her.

5422
05:31:04,310 --> 05:31:05,910
Why are you staring at my...

5423
05:31:05,910 --> 05:31:08,710
Oh, I'm not staring at your face.

5424
05:31:09,090 --> 05:31:10,490
Why are you staring at my face?

5425
05:31:10,970 --> 05:31:11,290
Why are you...

5426
05:31:11,290 --> 05:31:12,490
Come on, Snake.

5427
05:31:18,230 --> 05:31:19,950
Don't stare at me like that.

5428
05:31:20,510 --> 05:31:21,910
She doesn't look to be getting redder.

5429
05:31:22,590 --> 05:31:22,910
Does she?

5430
05:31:23,910 --> 05:31:25,730
Why are you staring at my face?

5431
05:31:27,370 --> 05:31:29,050
We've got to get a move on.

5432
05:31:29,290 --> 05:31:30,490
She's so shy.

5433
05:31:32,050 --> 05:31:33,090
Your face.

5434
05:31:34,590 --> 05:31:35,030
What?

5435
05:31:35,490 --> 05:31:36,230
What is it?

5436
05:31:36,870 --> 05:31:38,510
She doesn't seem to be getting redder, does she?

5437
05:31:38,810 --> 05:31:39,330
Takes a while?

5438
05:31:41,850 --> 05:31:43,390
Why are you staring at my...

5439
05:31:43,390 --> 05:31:43,950
Face.

5440
05:31:44,670 --> 05:31:45,670
It's the foundation.

5441
05:31:46,730 --> 05:31:48,210
It's covering her blush.

5442
05:31:48,430 --> 05:31:48,710
So true.

5443
05:31:48,910 --> 05:31:50,030
Come on, Snake.

5444
05:31:50,290 --> 05:31:52,010
It doesn't take that long in the original.

5445
05:31:52,910 --> 05:31:53,270
Hmm.

5446
05:31:57,470 --> 05:32:06,090

05:32:24,090 --> 05:32:27,710

5450
05:32:28,110 --> 05:32:29,550
Okay, I don't think she's gonna turn red.

5451
05:32:29,950 --> 05:32:32,130
That's a little sad, but...

5452
05:32:32,130 --> 05:32:33,110
Are these guys still in here?

5453
05:32:33,710 --> 05:32:34,730
Even they are gone?

5454
05:32:36,250 --> 05:32:36,630
Okay.

5455
05:32:37,550 --> 05:32:37,910
Okay.

5456
05:32:42,290 --> 05:32:44,730
Everyone's gone, so I'm taking advantage of the situation,
baby.

5457
05:32:46,590 --> 05:32:48,670
Yeah, let's take that.

5458
05:32:49,290 --> 05:32:50,770
Bombs bullets are full.

5459
05:32:52,510 --> 05:32:53,090
Uh, what's this?

5460
05:32:54,050 --> 05:32:54,270
Oh!

5461
05:32:55,570 --> 05:32:56,010
Wait!

5462
05:32:56,650 --> 05:32:57,870
That's the Pazaza meme!

5463
05:32:58,490 --> 05:32:59,030
Oh, sorry.

5464
05:32:59,570 --> 05:33:00,830
Don't hit me.

5465
05:33:02,490 --> 05:33:03,670
Get out of my way, Meryl.

5466
05:33:04,470 --> 05:33:08,190
Wait, why is the name of the position being different?

5467
05:33:10,530 --> 05:33:11,350
What's this?

5468
05:33:12,490 --> 05:33:13,770
Oh, call soup.

5469
05:33:15,570 --> 05:33:16,130
Sorry.

5470
05:33:17,090 --> 05:33:18,970
Oh, I'm hiding now.

5471
05:33:19,030 --> 05:33:19,170
Oh.

5472
05:33:19,710 --> 05:33:20,670
What does this say?

5473
05:33:21,210 --> 05:33:21,630
Notice.

5474
05:33:24,290 --> 05:33:25,970
Oh, no, no, not yet.

5475
05:33:26,810 --> 05:33:27,970
Over here, yep.

5476
05:33:29,130 --> 05:33:30,130
Stung grenade.

5477
05:33:30,330 --> 05:33:31,970
Oh, no more in the key that...

5478
05:33:31,970 --> 05:33:33,270
Why is there so many?

5479
05:33:35,010 --> 05:33:36,710
They're all just chilling out.

5480
05:33:42,430 --> 05:33:42,950
Everything is...

5481
05:33:42,950 --> 05:33:44,890
I think I'm good, honestly, on everything.

5482
05:33:45,590 --> 05:33:47,010
I don't think I could get anything else.

5483
05:33:47,910 --> 05:33:49,430
Unless there's, like, a...

5484
05:33:49,430 --> 05:33:49,730
Yeah.

5485
05:33:57,130 --> 05:33:58,810
Oh, yeah, I'm good on everything.

5486
05:33:59,970 --> 05:34:01,250
It's a well-stocked office.

5487
05:34:01,390 --> 05:34:01,950
Yes, it is.

5488
05:34:02,990 --> 05:34:03,390
Nice.

5489
05:34:03,910 --> 05:34:06,170
I don't think there's anything under these ones.

5490
05:34:07,050 --> 05:34:07,830
I don't think I can remember.

5491
05:34:08,630 --> 05:34:09,070
Sorry.

5492
05:34:09,990 --> 05:34:10,570
Stay out.

5493
05:34:10,670 --> 05:34:11,830
This is what I mean, Meryl.

5494
05:34:12,010 --> 05:34:12,990
Like, you're in my way, Meryl.

5495
05:34:14,690 --> 05:34:14,990
Okay.

5496
05:34:16,450 --> 05:34:17,350
Um, hold on.

5497
05:34:17,450 --> 05:34:18,670
Let me have, how much time?

5498
05:34:18,850 --> 05:34:22,030
Okay, I have five minutes before my pizza's done.

5499
05:34:22,590 --> 05:34:27,110
Like I said, I don't want to get into Psycho Mantis and,
like, have to stop mid-fight.

5500
05:34:28,090 --> 05:34:28,530
Hmm.

5501
05:34:30,470 --> 05:34:30,910
Hmm.

5502
05:34:34,170 --> 05:34:36,690
Let's just listen to this ASMR of their footsteps.

5503
05:34:41,020 --> 05:34:42,160
Oh my god.

5504
05:34:44,200 --> 05:34:46,400
The sound, this is so like...

5505
05:34:46,400 --> 05:34:46,880
Wait, what's going on?

5506
05:34:46,880 --> 05:34:49,040
Snake, let's hurry up and go to the commander's room.

5507
05:34:49,140 --> 05:34:49,920
I'm sorry!

5508
05:34:50,460 --> 05:34:50,600
Oh.

5509
05:34:51,880 --> 05:34:53,080
She is not having it.

5510
05:34:53,140 --> 05:34:54,440
She is leaving without me.

5511
05:35:01,320 --> 05:35:02,220
What kind of pizza?

5512
05:35:02,380 --> 05:35:04,240
It's just cheese pizza.

5513
05:35:04,760 --> 05:35:06,220
It's just a cheese pizza.

5514
05:35:09,680 --> 05:35:11,460
Can I go back into the girl's bathroom?

5515
05:35:15,050 --> 05:35:16,430
I'm not going to see mirror.

5516
05:35:16,470 --> 05:35:18,570
Mirrors for very long anymore, so...

5517
05:35:22,760 --> 05:35:23,320
Whoa!

5518
05:35:24,400 --> 05:35:24,600
Whoa!

5519
05:35:27,740 --> 05:35:28,860
Um, wait.

5520
05:35:42,160 --> 05:35:43,760
I'm a handsome fella, aren't I?

5521
05:35:48,760 --> 05:35:50,280
Working mirrors, yeah.

5522
05:35:50,940 --> 05:35:51,500
Technology.

5523
05:35:54,540 --> 05:35:55,980
Wash your hands.

5524
05:35:59,700 --> 05:36:01,080
Maybe there's stuff in here, too.

5525
05:36:01,140 --> 05:36:01,620
We haven't checked.

5526
05:36:04,200 --> 05:36:04,720
Nice.

5527
05:36:07,280 --> 05:36:09,440
Is this the one with the toilet on the ground?

5528
05:36:12,320 --> 05:36:12,880
Oh.

5529
05:36:15,500 --> 05:36:17,060
Excuse me, Meryl.

5530
05:36:18,040 --> 05:36:19,940
I have to go to the little girl's room.

5531
05:36:22,480 --> 05:36:24,200
And let's also...

5532
05:36:28,360 --> 05:36:28,980
Sniffa.

5533
05:36:30,220 --> 05:36:31,700
Sniffa, sniff, sniff, sniff.

5534
05:36:32,800 --> 05:36:33,420
Okay.

5535
05:36:33,420 --> 05:36:35,840
We're just wasting time right now.

5536
05:36:35,860 --> 05:36:39,360

5537
05:36:44,760 --> 05:37:02,440

make a mistake I will accidentally shoot her.

5542

Or purposefully.

5543
05:38:03,870 --> 05:38:05,470
Okay, just one more minute, you guys.

Actually, I'm just gonna go.

05:39:57,870 --> 05:39:59,670
Pizza is served.

5551
05:40:00,990 --> 05:40:03,490

Uh, I realized something.

05:40:41,700 --> 05:40:50,200
Um, for Psychomantis, um, you know how, like, you have to
change the controller port and all that fun stuff.

5558
05:40:52,040 --> 05:40:52,520
What?

5559
05:40:52,920 --> 05:40:54,700

05:40:57,900 --> 05:41:00,680
Um, uh, well, Colonel will tell me.

Oh, don't come here, Snake.

5566
05:41:41,840 --> 05:41:46,100
Whoa, whoa, I'm getting motion sick for real.

5567
05:41:47,700 --> 05:41:48,240
Too many thighs.

5568
05:41:49,720 --> 05:41:51,620
I don't think she's okay, Snake.

5569
05:41:51,840 --> 05:41:52,580
I don't think she's okay.

5570
05:42:01,940 --> 05:42:03,320
What happened?

5571
05:42:04,420 --> 05:42:05,800
I'm fine.

5572
05:42:08,300 --> 05:42:09,060
Hi, Hannah.

5573
05:42:13,770 --> 05:42:14,270
Oh.

5574
05:42:14,450 --> 05:42:16,450
Oh, what is...

5575
05:42:26,510 --> 05:42:29,130
Okay, let's go.

5576
05:42:31,230 --> 05:42:33,370
Oh, come on, Mr. Foxhound.

5577
05:42:34,010 --> 05:42:35,190
The commander is waiting.

5578
05:42:35,650 --> 05:42:36,880
Wait, where's our extra like...

5579
05:42:40,170 --> 05:42:43,530
That's the extra like zoomies and stuff.

5580
05:42:43,650 --> 05:42:44,770
That's what you take away.

5581
05:42:45,310 --> 05:42:47,670
But you'll add in everything else to this version.

5582
05:42:48,970 --> 05:42:50,230
I like that line, though.

5583
05:42:50,410 --> 05:42:51,470
The commander is waving.

5584
05:42:55,900 --> 05:42:57,680
Also, oh, oh, there it is.

5585
05:42:57,780 --> 05:43:04,540
I was going to say, when you look at her, it's you looking
at her, but oh, it switches.

5586
05:43:05,120 --> 05:43:06,100
Oh, my gosh, that's kind of cool.

5587
05:43:06,580 --> 05:43:07,020
Whoa.

5588
05:43:09,100 --> 05:43:10,280
But you can't move it.

5589
05:43:10,380 --> 05:43:11,600
You can't move around or anything.

5590
05:43:12,320 --> 05:43:12,420
Oh.

5591
05:43:19,050 --> 05:43:20,330
That is pretty cool.

5592
05:43:21,490 --> 05:43:21,930
Beep, beep.

5593
05:43:23,170 --> 05:43:26,310
And also, she's red on on the thing now.

5594
05:43:27,490 --> 05:43:28,790
The commander is waiting.

5595
05:43:32,250 --> 05:43:32,310
Oh!

5596
05:43:41,180 --> 05:43:42,580
Can you trank her?

5597
05:43:45,680 --> 05:43:48,060
I wonder in this part, actually.

5598
05:43:51,660 --> 05:43:53,380
If we can trank her instead.

5599
05:43:56,340 --> 05:43:58,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

5600
05:43:58,940 --> 05:43:59,780
Whoa, whoa!

5601
05:44:00,280 --> 05:44:01,560
Caution, stand back!

5602
05:44:01,920 --> 05:44:02,500
Girlie?

5603
05:44:03,840 --> 05:44:05,100
Can't you read?

5604
05:44:05,260 --> 05:44:06,420
Do you like me?

5605
05:44:07,260 --> 05:44:08,000
What the?

5606
05:44:12,200 --> 05:44:14,200
She's getting handsy with us.

5607
05:44:14,660 --> 05:44:14,700
Whoa!

5608
05:44:15,340 --> 05:44:16,360
No, don't go any lower.

5609
05:44:16,680 --> 05:44:17,660
Do you like me?

5610
05:44:17,720 --> 05:44:18,180
That's for Hal.

5611
05:44:24,380 --> 05:44:25,100
Whoa.

5612
05:44:25,400 --> 05:44:26,340
Hold me.

5613
05:44:26,760 --> 05:44:27,360
Snake.

5614
05:44:27,740 --> 05:44:28,140
Whoa, whoa.

5615
05:44:28,220 --> 05:44:28,820
What's wrong?

5616
05:44:29,400 --> 05:44:30,640
You're psychotherapy.

5617
05:44:31,040 --> 05:44:31,220
Hurry.

5618
05:44:32,560 --> 05:44:33,280
Please.

5619
05:44:34,140 --> 05:44:35,140
Make left me.

5620
05:44:48,950 --> 05:44:53,470
The fact that Psycho Mantis is saying all this, that's one
freaky guy.

5621
05:45:06,500 --> 05:45:07,020
Oh,

5622
05:45:17,330 --> 05:45:17,810
okay, hold on.

5623
05:45:18,070 --> 05:45:18,950
Do I need to do something now?

5624
05:45:19,870 --> 05:45:21,110
I'm eating pizza.

5625
05:45:21,770 --> 05:45:21,910
Oh!

5626
05:45:23,150 --> 05:45:24,190
That wasn't me.

5627
05:45:24,770 --> 05:45:25,570
Merrill's not herself.

5628
05:45:25,990 --> 05:45:26,990
Don't use your weapon.

5629
05:45:27,150 --> 05:45:28,310
I was only starting the codec!

5630
05:45:28,810 --> 05:45:29,950
He's controlling Merrill.

5631
05:45:30,550 --> 05:45:32,290
That tune is his mind control music.

5632
05:45:33,250 --> 05:45:34,210
Don't use your weapon.

5633
05:45:34,730 --> 05:45:35,650
Try to knock her out.

5634
05:45:35,770 --> 05:45:35,930
Okay.

5635
05:45:37,650 --> 05:45:39,110
Oh, he shot me?

5636
05:45:39,410 --> 05:45:40,290
That's so messed up.

5637
05:45:40,370 --> 05:45:41,490
I was answering the codec.

5638
05:45:44,150 --> 05:45:44,690
Oh!

5639
05:45:45,150 --> 05:45:45,350
Oh!

5640
05:45:45,590 --> 05:45:45,810
Whoa!

5641
05:45:46,090 --> 05:45:46,410
Whoa!

5642
05:45:47,330 --> 05:45:50,870
Wait, I forgot how to shoot all of a sudden.

5643
05:45:52,050 --> 05:45:53,430
There we go.

5644
05:45:54,210 --> 05:45:55,650
She's out?

5645
05:46:08,530 --> 05:46:09,770
Useless woman.

5646
05:46:14,070 --> 05:46:15,470
Optic camouflage, huh?

5647
05:46:15,610 --> 05:46:16,510
Who are these guys?

5648
05:46:16,530 --> 05:46:18,370
I hope that's not your only trick.

5649
05:46:19,850 --> 05:46:22,050
You doubt my power.

5650
05:46:23,610 --> 05:46:27,890
Now, I will show you why I am the most powerful
practitioner.

5651
05:46:28,170 --> 05:46:32,210
of psychokinesis and telepathy in the world.

5652
05:46:33,010 --> 05:46:36,390
No, there's no need for words, Snake.

5653
05:46:37,750 --> 05:46:41,390
I am psychomancers.

5654
05:46:41,730 --> 05:46:42,310
Nyam!

5655
05:46:42,590 --> 05:46:43,410
That's right.

5656
05:46:43,590 --> 05:46:45,430
Doug Stone is so awesome.

5657
05:46:46,130 --> 05:46:47,970
It's true power.

5658
05:46:49,450 --> 05:46:51,110
Who's the white guy?

5659
05:46:52,090 --> 05:46:52,970
I told you.

5660
05:46:53,710 --> 05:46:55,810
I can read your every thought.

5661
05:46:55,890 --> 05:46:56,610
Kojima!

5662
05:46:57,230 --> 05:46:57,950
In the middle.

5663

of us.

5666
05:47:29,310 --> 05:47:31,990
I see that you enjoy Nintendo games.

5667
05:47:33,730 --> 05:47:37,330
You like Silicon Knights games, don't you?

5668

So, you like adventure games?

Did you enjoy playing eternal darkness?

5670
05:47:49,590 --> 05:47:50,210
I'll be honest.

5671
05:47:50,450 --> 05:47:52,950
You seem to like the legend of Zelda, don't you?

5672
05:47:53,370 --> 05:47:55,510
I had a friend help me set up the memory card.

5673
05:47:55,730 --> 05:47:56,690

05:49:33,570 --> 05:49:38,170
you think now can you feel my power

5682
05:49:41,270 --> 05:49:43,530
The demonstration is over.

5683
05:50:00,590 --> 05:50:02,390
Stop drop and roll!

5684
05:50:04,310 --> 05:50:05,510
What is going on?

5685
05:50:06,190 --> 05:50:06,410
What?

5686
05:50:11,140 --> 05:50:12,260
Roll, what, what?

5687
05:50:12,500 --> 05:50:12,720
Huh?

5688
05:50:16,210 --> 05:50:16,670
I don't remember.

5689
05:50:17,830 --> 05:50:20,290
The pictures.

5690
05:50:23,370 --> 05:50:24,930
Wait, they're back to normal.

5691
05:50:32,430 --> 05:50:32,990
Um...

5692
05:50:32,990 --> 05:50:34,650
That was weird.

5693
05:50:43,050 --> 05:50:43,610
Colonel,

5694
05:50:50,850 --> 05:50:51,430
what do I do?

5695
05:50:52,830 --> 05:50:54,790
No, not you, Naomi!

5696
05:50:55,170 --> 05:50:55,910
KGB psychic.

5697
05:50:56,470 --> 05:50:58,990
He has powerful psychokinetic and telepathic abilities.

5698
05:50:59,870 --> 05:51:03,430
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he came to America
looking for a job.

5699
05:51:06,310 --> 05:51:07,350
I'm sorry, it's so funny.

5700
05:51:08,210 --> 05:51:09,510
because he was jobless.

5701
05:51:10,770 --> 05:51:11,630
He was unemployed.

5702
05:51:13,670 --> 05:51:16,110
As a result, he became just like the killer.

5703
05:51:17,230 --> 05:51:21,090
So he was sort of infected by this serial murderer's
thoughts?

5704
05:51:21,510 --> 05:51:24,870
In any case, after that, he became sort of a psychic spy
working...

5705
05:51:24,870 --> 05:51:26,310
Wait, this music is not...

5706
05:51:26,310 --> 05:51:27,550
He traveled all around the world.

5707
05:51:28,370 --> 05:51:30,010
That's when he was recruited by a foxhound.

5708
05:51:30,770 --> 05:51:31,790
This is not it.

5709
05:51:32,130 --> 05:51:34,270
He knows every move that you're going to make.

5710
05:51:34,570 --> 05:51:35,670
What should I do?

5711
05:51:35,890 --> 05:51:37,490
I got no chance of beating him.

5712
05:51:38,210 --> 05:51:47,350
must be some way he's a master of controlling people's night
don't let him manipulate you I don't know about the music I

5713
05:51:47,350 --> 05:52:08,010
think we just got blasted yep m9 I don't need that oh I
guess for Meral oh nice um oh my god okay maybe I have to

5714
05:52:08,010 --> 05:52:28,450

patterns again oh god oh god oh that's ah oh no he's right

5715
05:52:28,450 --> 05:52:34,770

just...

5716
05:52:46,260 --> 05:52:47,460
Colonel, help me!

5717
05:52:47,960 --> 05:52:48,780
How do I shoot him?

5718
05:52:48,940 --> 05:52:49,600
How do I shoot him?

5719
05:52:49,960 --> 05:52:50,820
I don't know what to do!

5720
05:52:51,880 --> 05:52:54,300
Not everything you see with your two eyes is real.

5721
05:52:55,160 --> 05:52:57,920
Destroying his spirit is more important than destroying his
body.

5722
05:52:58,460 --> 05:52:59,480
Don't let him read you.

5723
05:52:59,680 --> 05:52:59,740
Okay.

5724
05:53:00,080 --> 05:53:01,260
Be a blank slate.

5725
05:53:01,980 --> 05:53:02,160
Okay.

5726
05:53:02,500 --> 05:53:03,560
Clear your mind.

5727
05:53:04,480 --> 05:53:04,960
Um...

5728
05:53:04,960 --> 05:53:05,620
Um...

5729
05:53:05,620 --> 05:53:06,080
His...

5730
05:53:06,080 --> 05:53:07,000
Destroy his spirit.

5731
05:53:08,600 --> 05:53:09,640
Uh, hey, Bozo.

5732
05:53:09,840 --> 05:53:10,760
Oh, God.

5733
05:53:13,820 --> 05:53:15,840
You look really dumb with that, uh...

5734
05:53:18,640 --> 05:53:19,240
Oh, my God.

5735
05:53:20,400 --> 05:53:22,280
You look really stupid with that mask on!

5736
05:53:25,600 --> 05:53:26,080
Uh...

5737
05:53:32,340 --> 05:53:33,380
Uh, you...

5738
05:53:33,380 --> 05:53:35,480
Your pants are ugly!

5739
05:53:35,880 --> 05:53:36,380
Oh, my God.

5740
05:53:38,420 --> 05:53:40,440
Oh, why don't you grow some hair, Baldi?

5741
05:53:41,100 --> 05:53:41,620
Oh, my God.

5742
05:53:41,980 --> 05:53:42,600
I don't

5743
05:53:56,260 --> 05:53:57,220
know what port to put in.

5744
05:53:57,300 --> 05:53:57,720
Put in.

5745
05:53:59,940 --> 05:54:01,860
What port do I put it in?

5746
05:54:02,300 --> 05:54:03,820
Where do I put it in, Campbell?

5747
05:54:05,900 --> 05:54:09,240
He's using his psychic ability to read your controller's
moves.

5748
05:54:10,000 --> 05:54:11,520
That's how he's evading your attack.

5749
05:54:12,140 --> 05:54:13,320
Okay, I'm gonna try port 2.

5750
05:54:13,460 --> 05:54:15,360
You don't do something so he can't read your controller's
moves.

5751
05:54:16,080 --> 05:54:16,140
Think.

5752
05:54:16,700 --> 05:54:17,900
There must be some way.

5753
05:54:18,040 --> 05:54:19,960
Okay, I'm on port 2 right now.

5754
05:54:21,660 --> 05:54:23,080
There's four slots!

5755
05:54:24,020 --> 05:54:24,400
What?

5756
05:54:24,480 --> 05:54:25,200
How did that hit me?

5757
05:54:25,220 --> 05:54:26,400
I was on the ground.

5758
05:54:27,100 --> 05:54:27,540
Oh.

5759
05:54:27,980 --> 05:54:28,680
No, no, no, no, no.

5760
05:54:29,760 --> 05:54:30,920
Oh my god, no, no, no, no.

5761
05:54:34,300 --> 05:54:34,980
Where are you?

5762
05:54:45,050 --> 05:54:46,310
Oh, where is he?

5763
05:54:47,150 --> 05:54:47,370
I

5764
05:54:53,050 --> 05:54:55,950
can't tell actually if I'm just bad or...

5765
05:54:55,950 --> 05:54:57,130
No, dang it.

5766
05:55:16,710 --> 05:55:18,870
Okay, actually this remix is kind of awesome.

5767
05:55:26,330 --> 05:55:26,730
Ouch.

5768
05:55:29,170 --> 05:55:29,950
Okay, hold on.

5769
05:55:30,550 --> 05:55:32,070
It's not port two.

5770
05:55:33,030 --> 05:55:33,430
Turtle.

5771
05:55:36,710 --> 05:55:40,270
He's using his psychic ability to read your controller's
moves.

5772
05:55:41,050 --> 05:55:42,330
That's how he's evading your attack.

5773
05:55:42,470 --> 05:55:43,030
Okay, I'm gonna try.

5774
05:55:43,530 --> 05:55:44,430
Port three!

5775
05:55:44,950 --> 05:55:46,150
Port three!

5776
05:55:46,150 --> 05:55:46,430
Port three!

5777
05:55:47,490 --> 05:55:48,830
Port three!

5778
05:55:48,970 --> 05:55:49,470
Port three!

5779
05:55:49,470 --> 05:55:49,490
Port three!

5780
05:55:49,850 --> 05:55:50,110
Okay.

5781
05:55:51,970 --> 05:55:52,990
Wait, where am I?

5782
05:55:53,030 --> 05:55:54,410
Oh, I blend in with the floor!

5783
05:55:57,670 --> 05:55:58,470
Where are you?

5784
05:55:58,610 --> 05:55:59,050
There you are.

5785
05:56:01,070 --> 05:56:02,830
Come on, stop it.

5786
05:56:04,070 --> 05:56:05,150
Stop moving.

5787
05:56:09,350 --> 05:56:10,370
Did I get you?

5788
05:56:11,610 --> 05:56:11,910
Oh!

5789
05:56:12,250 --> 05:56:12,790
Nice!

5790
05:56:12,910 --> 05:56:13,030
Nice!

5791
05:56:13,570 --> 05:56:13,570
Nice!

5792
05:56:21,860 --> 05:56:22,740
Okay, point three!

5793
05:56:27,530 --> 05:56:28,550
Oh, well, oh, that's my arrow.

5794
05:56:37,250 --> 05:56:38,310
That didn't work.

5795
05:56:43,990 --> 05:56:44,930
Cut it out!

5796
05:56:45,030 --> 05:56:45,550
Cut it out!

5797
05:56:47,030 --> 05:56:47,670
Cut it out!

5798
05:56:48,950 --> 05:56:49,750
I can't.

5799
05:56:57,740 --> 05:56:58,740
Is it working?

5800
05:56:59,600 --> 05:57:03,070
Oh, it doesn't seem to be working.

5801
05:57:09,000 --> 05:57:10,500
Oh my god, not this thing again.

5802
05:57:11,300 --> 05:57:12,440
Not this guy, please.

5803
05:57:15,580 --> 05:57:16,620
Let's get here.

5804
05:57:16,900 --> 05:57:17,720
Oh, there's saw combos.

5805
05:57:20,220 --> 05:57:21,500
Uh, where are you at?

5806
05:57:21,580 --> 05:57:21,980
There you are.

5807
05:57:22,600 --> 05:57:23,720
Oh my gosh.

5808
05:57:28,430 --> 05:57:30,770
He's so slippery.

5809
05:57:31,110 --> 05:57:32,430
This guy is moving everywhere.

5810
05:57:34,370 --> 05:57:45,220
are hitting him like I know a bad but like even

5811
05:57:52,350 --> 05:57:56,910
when he's still

5812
05:58:04,320 --> 05:58:23,220
oh no he dodged it still wait colonel colonel wait wait
colonel I think I got wait huh Is there any reason you can't

5813
05:58:23,220 --> 05:58:24,760
use controller socket 4?

5814
05:58:27,720 --> 05:58:27,860
What?

5815
05:58:33,670 --> 05:58:34,690
Oh, okay.

5816
05:58:37,910 --> 05:58:39,270
4 is a spooky number.

5817
05:58:39,970 --> 05:58:40,550
That's why.

5818
05:58:41,130 --> 05:58:42,610
Okay, we got this now.

5819
05:58:44,670 --> 05:58:44,930
Maybe.

5820
05:58:45,810 --> 05:58:47,910
Oh, if I can aim.

5821
05:58:48,490 --> 05:58:49,550
If I can aim for it.

5822
05:58:53,310 --> 05:58:54,990
That was so funny.

5823
05:58:55,010 --> 05:58:58,210
Oh, child!

5824
05:58:59,650 --> 05:59:00,950
These things suck.

5825
05:59:07,170 --> 05:59:08,830
Gosh, dang it, this guy again.

5826
05:59:13,530 --> 05:59:14,770
He's right there!

5827
05:59:20,870 --> 05:59:22,790
Actually, what if I use the FAMIS instead?

5828
05:59:25,550 --> 05:59:26,530
Where are you?

5829
05:59:26,630 --> 05:59:27,030
Come here.

5830
05:59:30,650 --> 05:59:31,470
Where did you go?

5831
05:59:35,810 --> 05:59:36,890
And, uh, shoot!

5832
06:00:07,280 --> 06:00:08,360
Whoa, whoa, where'd you go?

5833
06:00:08,460 --> 06:00:09,560
Oh, dang.

5834
06:00:18,110 --> 06:00:19,210
This is so scuffed.

5835
06:00:20,990 --> 06:00:23,030
This is so scuffed.

5836
06:00:25,570 --> 06:00:26,790
Oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5837
06:00:26,990 --> 06:00:29,050
I was gonna say it's way easier than the, uh...

5838
06:00:29,990 --> 06:00:31,430
than the original one.

5839
06:00:31,650 --> 06:00:32,270
It's just funny.

5840
06:00:33,110 --> 06:00:35,050
It's just funny how...

5841
06:00:39,910 --> 06:00:41,150
Hello, it's, uh...

5842
06:00:42,710 --> 06:00:43,110
Okay.

5843
06:00:44,530 --> 06:00:44,930
And...

5844
06:00:46,110 --> 06:00:46,510
And...

5845
06:00:46,510 --> 06:00:48,230
Back to...

5846
06:00:48,230 --> 06:00:49,670
Oh, not this guy again.

5847
06:00:50,810 --> 06:00:52,170
This is kind of the best spot.

5848
06:01:01,380 --> 06:01:02,920
Oh, this is so funny.

5849
06:01:03,760 --> 06:01:03,840
Oh.

5850
06:01:04,600 --> 06:01:05,840
Oh, not Meryl again.

5851
06:01:06,000 --> 06:01:06,760
Okay, this is fine though.

5852
06:01:06,820 --> 06:01:07,160
This is fine.

5853
06:01:08,080 --> 06:01:09,220
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5854
06:01:09,220 --> 06:01:09,780
What's going on?

5855
06:01:09,860 --> 06:01:10,560
What's going on?

5856
06:01:12,580 --> 06:01:12,980
Uh...

5857
06:01:12,980 --> 06:01:14,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5858
06:01:14,560 --> 06:01:14,840
Whoa, whoa.

5859
06:01:15,500 --> 06:01:16,100
Oh, girly.

5860
06:01:16,300 --> 06:01:16,500
Ah!

5861
06:01:16,700 --> 06:01:17,000
Gurly!

5862
06:01:17,200 --> 06:01:17,560
Hold on!

5863
06:01:21,900 --> 06:01:23,440
We'll get her, we'll get her down.

5864
06:01:24,160 --> 06:01:24,640
Come on.

5865
06:01:25,580 --> 06:01:26,220
There we go.

5866
06:01:27,260 --> 06:01:27,700
Easy peasy.

5867
06:01:46,660 --> 06:01:47,940
Stop it, Meryl.

5868
06:01:48,720 --> 06:01:48,800
Meryl.

5869
06:01:54,070 --> 06:01:54,130
Ow!

5870
06:01:54,630 --> 06:01:55,870
Oh, that was close.

5871
06:01:58,910 --> 06:01:59,430
Meryl.

5872
06:02:00,030 --> 06:02:00,230
Stop.

5873
06:02:00,370 --> 06:02:02,110
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my god.

5874
06:02:02,590 --> 06:02:05,310
Oh, I thought me punching her did enough.

5875
06:02:08,430 --> 06:02:09,990
Okay, that should be good now.

5876
06:02:10,950 --> 06:02:11,270
Okay.

5877
06:02:15,140 --> 06:02:15,660
Okay.

5878
06:02:37,770 --> 06:02:39,330
Okay, it's so fast.

5879
06:02:39,430 --> 06:02:40,730
Oh, oh, I ran right into that.

5880
06:02:53,880 --> 06:02:54,800
Where are you?

5881
06:02:55,320 --> 06:02:55,780
Oh, there you are.

5882
06:02:56,660 --> 06:02:57,020
What?

5883
06:02:58,240 --> 06:03:00,520
I cannot read you.

5884
06:03:00,760 --> 06:03:01,940
Oh, where did you go?

5885
06:03:02,380 --> 06:03:02,620
Nobody?

5886
06:03:04,660 --> 06:03:05,240
Oh, no.

5887
06:03:06,380 --> 06:03:07,060
Where are you?

5888
06:03:13,570 --> 06:03:14,010
Ow!

5889
06:03:14,410 --> 06:03:14,890
Oh.

5890
06:03:24,510 --> 06:03:26,270
He's so fast.

5891
06:03:29,830 --> 06:03:31,550
I shot him in the butt.

5892
06:03:32,570 --> 06:03:34,270
Oh, uh, oh, dang it.

5893
06:03:34,450 --> 06:03:35,670
I pressed X too slowly.

5894
06:03:38,250 --> 06:03:39,170
Oh, they're all coming out.

5895
06:03:39,510 --> 06:03:41,050
Oh, he's pulling out all the stops.

5896
06:03:41,970 --> 06:03:42,570
That's fine.

5897
06:03:46,070 --> 06:03:46,950
I can still hit you.

5898
06:03:54,010 --> 06:03:55,950
Colonel, your niece is going to be Okay.

5899
06:03:56,670 --> 06:03:56,990
Is she?

5900
06:03:59,810 --> 06:04:00,730
No way.

5901
06:04:01,430 --> 06:04:03,790
The boss fights in this are crazy.

5902
06:04:05,530 --> 06:04:08,850
But why did you go so far out of your way to save her?

5903
06:04:09,830 --> 06:04:10,650
For Campbell's sake?

5904
06:04:11,410 --> 06:04:12,610
Or maybe it's because you like her.

5905
06:04:12,790 --> 06:04:15,330
I don't want to see any woman die right in front of me.

5906
06:04:15,510 --> 06:04:15,990
Or a person.

5907
06:04:16,210 --> 06:04:16,490
You know?

5908
06:04:16,770 --> 06:04:17,430
I don't want to see anyone die.

5909
06:04:17,430 --> 06:04:19,570
Since when did anybody's death bother you so much?

5910
06:04:20,150 --> 06:04:20,610
Naomi.

5911
06:04:21,450 --> 06:04:23,750
It's true that Snake has killed a lot of people.

5912
06:04:25,630 --> 06:04:26,590
doesn't have a heart.

5913
06:04:27,110 --> 06:04:28,050
It's okay, Colonel.

5914
06:04:29,290 --> 06:04:29,790
She's right.

5915
06:04:30,610 --> 06:04:31,470
Nah, just women.

5916
06:04:32,290 --> 06:04:33,450
Thank you, thank you.

5917
06:04:34,550 --> 06:04:38,910
It's still possible to beat Psychomancers by dying twice and
calling the Colonel afterwards to find out what's during the

5918
06:04:38,910 --> 06:04:39,390
statue bus.

5919
06:04:39,710 --> 06:04:40,210
Oh, yeah.

5920
06:04:40,670 --> 06:04:40,810
Okay.

5921
06:04:42,990 --> 06:04:44,350
Should I switch back to port one?

5922
06:04:45,550 --> 06:04:46,890
Does it matter at this point?

5923
06:04:53,010 --> 06:04:53,890
Control or port?

5924
06:04:54,150 --> 06:04:54,930
Yeah, sorry.

5925
06:04:55,630 --> 06:04:58,650
I wasn't able to read the future.

5926
06:04:58,690 --> 06:04:59,230
I know.

5927
06:05:00,130 --> 06:05:03,530
I'm like trying port two, port three.

5928
06:05:04,330 --> 06:05:09,570
And then Colonel's just like, hey, any reason you haven't
switched to port four, dummy?

5929
06:05:09,690 --> 06:05:11,230
I will read your future.

5930
06:05:14,450 --> 06:05:21,630
To get to Metal Gear's underground maintenance base, you
have to go through the hidden door.

5931
06:05:22,170 --> 06:05:25,610
There's a hidden door behind the bookcase.

5932
06:05:25,630 --> 06:05:26,270
Yeah.

5933
06:05:28,830 --> 06:05:29,710
Called out.

5934
06:05:32,090 --> 06:05:34,750
I thought, well, I hit him that one time.

5935
06:05:35,050 --> 06:05:36,790
Go past the communication towers.

5936
06:05:36,790 --> 06:05:38,570
So I thought with the three port, it was fine.

5937
06:05:41,290 --> 06:05:42,170
Long time.

5938
06:05:43,990 --> 06:05:45,170
Elfrey, thank you!

5939
06:05:46,610 --> 06:05:47,750
First time clear.

5940
06:05:47,910 --> 06:05:48,130
I know.

5941
06:05:50,390 --> 06:05:51,910
This game is way easier.

5942
06:05:52,810 --> 06:05:55,350
You don't need to thank, or you don't need to congratulate
me.

5943
06:05:55,630 --> 06:05:57,650
Thank you so much for that.

5944
06:05:58,350 --> 06:06:00,990
Thank you so much.

5945
06:06:00,990 --> 06:06:01,910
Oh, disgusting.

5946
06:06:03,360 --> 06:06:05,110
Oh, God.

5947
06:06:06,490 --> 06:06:07,570
Oh, you're so mean, Meryl.

5948
06:06:08,370 --> 06:06:16,570
And each mind that I peered into was stuffed with the same
single object of obsession.

5949
06:06:17,360 --> 06:06:22,870
That selfish and that avistic desire to pass on one seed.

5950
06:06:23,010 --> 06:06:26,230
It wasn't enough to make me sick.

5951
06:06:27,610 --> 06:06:34,430
Every living thing on this planet exists to mindlessly pass
on their DNA.

5952
06:06:35,590 --> 06:06:40,710
We're designed that way and that is why there is war.

5953
06:06:41,230 --> 06:06:41,610
Is that?

5954
06:06:41,850 --> 06:06:43,650
But you... Is that it?

5955
06:06:44,170 --> 06:06:45,430
I don't know about that.

5956
06:06:45,790 --> 06:06:47,310
You're the same as us.

5957
06:06:48,150 --> 06:06:50,650
We have no past, no future.

5958
06:06:51,010 --> 06:06:52,850
Aw, no snake has his dogs.

5959
06:06:53,550 --> 06:06:55,210
That's our only purpose.

5960
06:06:55,630 --> 06:06:57,070
He has his dogs.

5961
06:06:57,530 --> 06:07:00,690
Humans weren't designed to bring each other happiness.

5962
06:07:01,130 --> 06:07:02,470
Kind of like that they're not showing his face.

5963
06:07:02,790 --> 06:07:10,310
From the moment we're thrown into this world, we're fated to
bring each other nothing but pain and pain.

5964
06:07:10,450 --> 06:07:10,970
Oh, just kidding.

5965
06:07:12,550 --> 06:07:17,290
The first person whose mind I dove into was my father's.

5966
06:07:17,290 --> 06:07:17,610
Don't scare.

5967
06:07:18,790 --> 06:07:23,310
I saw nothing but disgust and hatred for me.

5968
06:07:23,450 --> 06:07:23,970
It is hard.

5969
06:07:23,970 --> 06:07:25,370
Because I was thinking in, like, uh...

5970
06:07:25,370 --> 06:07:27,790
My mother died in childbirth.

5971
06:07:27,870 --> 06:07:30,670
In the original, they show his face, obviously, but...

5972
06:07:31,170 --> 06:07:34,970
But it's more low-poly, so you can't really tell how he
looks exactly.

5973
06:07:39,350 --> 06:07:42,490
That's when my future disappeared.

5974
06:07:43,150 --> 06:07:44,230
Voldemort converted.

5975
06:07:44,270 --> 06:07:45,630
He hasn't met past as well.

5976
06:07:46,650 --> 06:07:51,230
When I came to, the village was engulfed in flames.

5977
06:07:51,690 --> 06:07:51,990
Huh.

5978
06:07:53,970 --> 06:08:07,210
your village down to bury your past I see that you have
suffered the same trauma we are truly the same you and I the

5979
06:08:07,210 --> 06:08:20,490
world is a more interesting place with people like you in it
I never agreed with the boss's revolution his dreams of

5980
06:08:20,490 --> 06:08:23,670
World conquest do not interest me.

5981
06:08:24,150 --> 06:08:29,790
I just want an excuse to kill as many people as I courted.

5982
06:08:31,310 --> 06:08:32,490
You monster.

5983
06:08:32,730 --> 06:08:33,290
Let him talk.

5984
06:08:33,790 --> 06:08:33,970
Yeah.

5985
06:08:34,130 --> 06:08:36,030
He doesn't have much time left.

5986
06:08:39,150 --> 06:08:40,770
I've seen true evil.

5987
06:08:41,790 --> 06:08:46,310
Snake, seeing you calms my soul.

5988
06:08:46,910 --> 06:08:47,770
Let him cook.

5989
06:08:47,970 --> 06:08:48,670
I'm the boss.

5990
06:08:48,990 --> 06:08:50,230
No, worse.

5991
06:08:50,490 --> 06:09:02,330
that's so messed up compared to you i'm like a saint how
could you even say that i read her mind as well merrill's i

5992
06:09:02,330 --> 06:09:18,490

place and getting bigger oh what i do not know if your

5993
06:09:18,490 --> 06:09:36,530

last request what is it my mask put it back on okay the

5994
06:09:36,530 --> 06:09:51,050
voices are too strong like this other people's thoughts
force their way into my mind before i die i want want to be

5995
06:09:51,050 --> 06:09:57,370
left alone in my own world no i really like psychomantis

5996
06:10:13,200 --> 06:10:27,580
i'll open the door for you if you want to find your future
go through that door the controller is rumbling more than

5997
06:10:27,580 --> 06:10:30,860
when he was controlling it this is the first time

5998
06:10:33,960 --> 06:10:47,780
someone Strange such a nostalgic feeling No

5999
06:11:02,260 --> 06:11:16,120
Even in a goofy version of the series like this gets me all
choked up Yeah, let's go Meryl I'm sorry Meryl How could I

6000
06:11:16,120 --> 06:11:18,520
let Mantis control my mind like that?

6001
06:11:18,620 --> 06:11:23,560
If you're going to doubt yourself, I'll leave you here.

6002
06:11:25,300 --> 06:11:25,740
You're right.

6003
06:11:27,680 --> 06:11:28,800
Don't regret your past.

6004
06:11:29,220 --> 06:11:29,940
Learn from it.

6005
06:11:30,480 --> 06:11:32,080
Regrets just make a person weaker.

6006
06:11:32,620 --> 06:11:34,140
So true, Snake.

6007
06:11:34,560 --> 06:11:35,000
You're right.

6008
06:11:35,580 --> 06:11:36,360
I'm sorry.

6009
06:11:37,000 --> 06:11:38,400
I won't do it again.

6010
06:11:40,120 --> 06:11:42,020
Snake, can I ask you something?

6011
06:11:42,380 --> 06:11:43,220
What's your name?

6012
06:11:43,440 --> 06:11:44,020
What's your birthday?

6013
06:11:44,200 --> 06:11:44,980
More complaints.

6014
06:11:45,200 --> 06:11:45,600
Your family.

6015
06:11:46,420 --> 06:11:47,720
About what Mantis said.

6016
06:11:48,620 --> 06:11:49,600
I was just wondering.

6017
06:11:50,600 --> 06:11:51,340
No regrets.

6018
06:11:51,700 --> 06:11:52,460
No regrets.

6019
06:11:52,840 --> 06:11:53,100
What?

6020
06:11:53,300 --> 06:11:54,380
What's the problem now?

6021
06:11:56,840 --> 06:11:58,040
Oh, no.

6022
06:11:58,700 --> 06:11:59,080
Nothing.

6023
06:11:59,460 --> 06:11:59,980
What's your issue?

6024
06:12:00,300 --> 06:12:01,920
What are you complaining about?

6025
06:12:01,980 --> 06:12:02,680
Are you cold?

6026
06:12:03,560 --> 06:12:04,440
What's your name?

6027
06:12:05,620 --> 06:12:06,540
Your real name.

6028
06:12:06,880 --> 06:12:07,680
I don't got one.

6029
06:12:08,420 --> 06:12:10,460
A name means nothing on the battlefield.

6030
06:12:11,320 --> 06:12:13,240
After a week, no one has a name.

6031
06:12:15,200 --> 06:12:16,100
How old are you?

6032
06:12:17,700 --> 06:12:18,540
Old enough.

6033
06:12:18,620 --> 06:12:20,660
Old enough to know what death looks like.

6034
06:12:21,780 --> 06:12:22,980
Any family?

6035
06:12:24,140 --> 06:12:24,380
No.

6036
06:12:25,020 --> 06:12:26,780
But I was raised by many people.

6037
06:12:28,000 --> 06:12:29,000
Is there anyone you like?

6038
06:12:30,800 --> 06:12:31,840
My dogs.

6039
06:12:33,840 --> 06:12:36,400
I've never been interested in anyone else's life.

6040
06:12:37,160 --> 06:12:38,420
My 50 huskies.

6041
06:12:39,280 --> 06:12:40,440
So you are all alone.

6042
06:12:41,220 --> 06:12:42,380
Just like Manta said.

6043
06:12:47,250 --> 06:12:49,310
Other people just complicate my life.

6044
06:12:49,690 --> 06:12:50,950
I don't like to get involved.

6045
06:12:52,710 --> 06:12:54,670
You're a sad, lonely man.

6046
06:12:57,150 --> 06:12:57,310
I like...

6047
06:12:57,310 --> 06:12:58,810
Come on, let's go.

6048
06:12:59,930 --> 06:13:06,730
I like the original more because I think in the original it
was more like kind of quick, like quick quips.

6049
06:13:07,090 --> 06:13:07,950
Like, how old are you?

6050
06:13:08,050 --> 06:13:08,430
Blah, blah, blah.

6051
06:13:09,470 --> 06:13:10,010
Where are you?

6052
06:13:10,130 --> 06:13:12,590
Like, how many people are in your family?

6053
06:13:12,830 --> 06:13:13,230
Blah, blah, blah.

6054
06:13:13,330 --> 06:13:14,450
Like, it was... Oh, oh!

6055
06:13:14,710 --> 06:13:15,570
Use controller!

6056
06:13:18,750 --> 06:13:19,730
There we go.

6057
06:13:20,350 --> 06:13:20,730
Look up.

6058
06:13:23,310 --> 06:13:24,510
Plugged it all back up.

6059
06:13:26,710 --> 06:13:29,570
Why is it so loud in my rumbly ears?

6060
06:13:33,250 --> 06:13:34,430
Who is this guy?

6061
06:13:37,850 --> 06:13:38,990
Who's that guy?

6062
06:13:42,430 --> 06:13:44,130
Actually, who's this guy too?

6063
06:13:49,400 --> 06:13:51,100
Oh, Silicon Knights guy!

6064
06:13:51,900 --> 06:13:53,960
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

6065
06:13:56,240 --> 06:13:58,020
Wait, that's Yoji Sinkawa?

6066
06:14:00,000 --> 06:14:00,700
Is it actually?

6067
06:14:00,860 --> 06:14:01,900
He looks... No.

6068
06:14:02,600 --> 06:14:03,000
Is it?

6069
06:14:03,100 --> 06:14:04,760
He looks so young if that's him.

6070
06:14:06,720 --> 06:14:08,000
Is it actually Yoji Sinkawa?

6071
06:14:08,220 --> 06:14:10,560
Oh my gosh, I didn't recognize him because he looks so
young.

6072
06:14:11,660 --> 06:14:12,700
No way!

6073
06:14:14,480 --> 06:14:15,820
Oh my gosh.

6074
06:14:16,420 --> 06:14:17,680
I mean, so does Hideyo Kojima.

6075
06:14:17,940 --> 06:14:18,820
He looks so young.

6076
06:14:21,180 --> 06:14:22,600
Oh, sorry.

6077
06:14:25,220 --> 06:14:26,480
I'm gonna miss this sound.

6078
06:14:28,020 --> 06:14:28,720
So crisp.

6079
06:14:39,870 --> 06:14:40,370
Good night.

6080
06:14:40,710 --> 06:14:41,950
Good night, sweet prince.

6081
06:14:46,270 --> 06:14:47,030
Alright, let's go, Meryl.

6082
06:14:50,470 --> 06:14:51,870
Oh, let's save.

6083
06:14:56,310 --> 06:14:58,690
The tongues of dying men Tongs!

6084
06:14:59,670 --> 06:15:01,590
No, I didn't use tongues.

6085
06:15:02,830 --> 06:15:14,610
lie with their dying breaths I think he was telling the
truth maybe you should believe him hmm maybe you should

6090
06:15:50,970 --> 06:15:57,050

base you should be able to go north from the commander's

6091
06:15:57,050 --> 06:16:06,490
room master miller What a pathetic man.

6092
06:16:07,090 --> 06:16:11,090
He was born with all the right tools, but he never knew how
to use them.

6093
06:16:11,310 --> 06:16:13,610
Never knew how to use them.

6094
06:16:16,570 --> 06:16:17,810
She's right behind me.

6095
06:16:18,710 --> 06:16:19,650
What if she's just like Snake?

6096
06:16:19,890 --> 06:16:20,550
I'm right here.

6097
06:16:22,890 --> 06:16:26,230
The enormous costs for the development of military weapons.

6098
06:16:26,350 --> 06:16:29,190
Are you eating your pizza while touching your controller
with greasy hands?

6099
06:16:29,430 --> 06:16:29,950
Sacralage.

6100
06:16:30,350 --> 06:16:30,610
No!

6101
06:16:33,310 --> 06:16:35,510
It's not, it wasn't that greasy of a pizza.

6102
06:16:36,330 --> 06:16:36,870
What'd you say?

6103
06:16:37,590 --> 06:16:40,210
I missed what Nostasha said because of you.

6104
06:16:41,170 --> 06:16:48,450
At the end of the Cold War, the old conflict patterns
collapsed and tension and controls were relieved.

6105
06:16:49,490 --> 06:16:51,170
Oh yeah, forgot about Otakon.

6106
06:16:51,470 --> 06:16:52,110
Sorry, Otakon.

6107
06:16:53,450 --> 06:16:54,450
Wait, is he listed?

6108
06:16:54,810 --> 06:16:56,490
I don't remember what his codec is.

6109
06:16:57,810 --> 06:17:01,830
Now, even economically weak countries can acquire military
strength.

6110
06:17:03,110 --> 06:17:03,750
Is he in here?

6111
06:17:04,210 --> 06:17:06,290
Oh no, what is Otakon's codec?

6112
06:17:07,990 --> 06:17:09,870
one for oh yes one for you only one two

6113
06:17:15,570 --> 06:17:24,430

ever knew what are you feeling sorry for him sorry had

maybe that power could have been used to make people happy

6115
06:17:30,830 --> 06:17:35,110
did you say sorry it's a sad thing when you see all that
power being used just for war

6116
06:17:38,470 --> 06:17:39,910
What are you feeling sorry for?

6117
06:17:46,300 --> 06:17:50,520
Snake, Metal Gear is in an underground base to the north.

6118
06:17:51,460 --> 06:17:51,480
Hurry!

6119
06:17:55,900 --> 06:17:56,300
Snake!

6120
06:17:57,200 --> 06:17:57,660
Okay.

6121
06:18:01,660 --> 06:18:01,800
Alright.

6122
06:18:02,180 --> 06:18:03,320
EQ my show.

6123
06:18:03,780 --> 06:18:04,520
What's over here?

6124
06:18:05,420 --> 06:18:05,960
Nice.

6125
06:18:06,120 --> 06:18:06,260
Wait.

6126
06:18:06,540 --> 06:18:07,020
Oh, sorry.

6127
06:18:07,140 --> 06:18:07,620
Sorry, girl.

6128
06:18:07,780 --> 06:18:08,080
Wow.

6129
06:18:10,780 --> 06:18:13,240
You don't have to be so dramatic about it, Meryl.

6130
06:18:16,420 --> 06:18:16,820
Sheesh.

6131
06:18:18,040 --> 06:18:23,140
Left picture is Ryuhei Kitamura, Japanese movie director who
directed the Twin Snake cutscenes.

6132
06:18:24,800 --> 06:18:25,680
I was gonna say...

6133
06:18:25,680 --> 06:18:26,860
Could there be wolves in here?

6134
06:18:27,740 --> 06:18:28,600
I was like...

6135
06:18:28,600 --> 06:18:29,220
Wolf dogs.

6136
06:18:29,320 --> 06:18:29,700
No wonder...

6137
06:18:29,700 --> 06:18:30,500
Okay, it's...

6138
06:18:30,500 --> 06:18:31,360
So it was like Yajishikawa.

6139
06:18:31,960 --> 06:18:32,260
I feel...

6140
06:18:32,260 --> 06:18:33,140
I don't feel as bad now.

6141
06:18:33,160 --> 06:18:34,060
How do you know so much?

6142
06:18:34,640 --> 06:18:34,840
Oh!

6143
06:18:35,780 --> 06:18:37,280
Five, six, seven, oh, no.

6144
06:18:37,460 --> 06:18:38,060
I'm a musher.

6145
06:18:38,480 --> 06:18:39,000
Oh my God.

6146
06:18:39,140 --> 06:18:39,620
I love it.

6147
06:18:40,740 --> 06:18:41,940
I'll take point.

6148
06:18:42,520 --> 06:18:43,720
Snake, you follow me.

6149
06:18:44,860 --> 06:18:45,220
Oh!

6150
06:18:46,780 --> 06:18:47,380
Ow!

6151
06:18:57,790 --> 06:18:59,570
Oh, that's where we crawl through.

6152
06:19:00,910 --> 06:19:00,970
Huh?

6153
06:19:01,270 --> 06:19:02,230
Whose footsteps are these?

6154
06:19:04,010 --> 06:19:05,070
Where'd you go?

6155
06:19:05,410 --> 06:19:06,190
Follow me.

6156
06:19:06,370 --> 06:19:07,530
To, um, where, madam?

6157
06:19:08,330 --> 06:19:09,470
You just left me...

6158
06:19:09,470 --> 06:19:10,570
You left me to die!

6159
06:19:14,440 --> 06:19:15,040
No.

6160
06:19:16,100 --> 06:19:16,660
No.

6161
06:19:16,840 --> 06:19:18,100
We can fit through there.

6162
06:19:19,920 --> 06:19:20,520
Okay.

6163
06:19:20,540 --> 06:19:26,880
I believed it maybe in the original, but there...

6164
06:19:26,880 --> 06:19:28,240
No, we can fit through that.

6165
06:19:29,680 --> 06:19:32,560
Please do awu, a $40 reward.

6166
06:19:33,200 --> 06:19:33,640
Awu!

6167
06:19:34,460 --> 06:19:35,220
Awu!

6168
06:19:36,360 --> 06:19:37,580
Ow, awu!

6169
06:19:38,640 --> 06:19:40,420
We can fit through that.

6170
06:19:41,060 --> 06:19:42,080
Snake, just go through.

6171
06:19:47,390 --> 06:19:49,030
Sounds kind of meaty.

6172
06:19:52,190 --> 06:19:53,910
We can fit through that.

6173
06:19:56,350 --> 06:19:57,950
Is this the way we came from?

6174
06:20:01,850 --> 06:20:04,510
How do I get the dogs to pee on my box?

6175
06:20:07,750 --> 06:20:09,030
Oh, I hear them.

6176
06:20:09,510 --> 06:20:10,590
I hear them growling.

6177
06:20:12,770 --> 06:20:13,290
Scary.

6178
06:20:17,670 --> 06:20:18,370
Oh, wait.

6179
06:20:18,630 --> 06:20:20,790
Actually, I can put them to sleep.

6180
06:20:31,010 --> 06:20:31,090
Oh.

6181
06:20:31,450 --> 06:20:32,690
Why is the music so scary?

6182
06:20:35,390 --> 06:20:37,310
Wait, why is the music so scary?

6183
06:20:43,070 --> 06:20:43,870
I'm scared.

6184
06:20:46,330 --> 06:20:47,710
Why is it so scary?

6185
06:20:49,730 --> 06:20:53,590
Pia si- Good to know that there's some ammo there, though.

6186
06:20:56,170 --> 06:20:58,470
Oh, oh, oh, wait, where is he coming from?

6187
06:20:59,750 --> 06:20:59,990
Dog!

6188
06:21:00,770 --> 06:21:02,470
Wait, where did- where am I coming from?

6189
06:21:03,790 --> 06:21:04,250
I'm like...

6190
06:21:04,270 --> 06:21:05,050
Oh, I saw it!

6191
06:21:05,150 --> 06:21:05,290
Okay.

6192
06:21:06,690 --> 06:21:09,050
This, wait, that's where we crawled out from, right?

6193
06:21:09,370 --> 06:21:09,650
Okay.

6194
06:21:18,840 --> 06:21:19,700
Lay pee on my box.

6195
06:21:25,250 --> 06:21:26,210
Pee on my box.

6196
06:21:29,770 --> 06:21:30,990
Pee on my box.

6197
06:21:34,330 --> 06:21:35,270
Pee on my box.

6198
06:21:35,430 --> 06:21:36,950
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, nice, nice, nice.

6199
06:21:39,170 --> 06:21:40,030
Pee on my box.

6200
06:21:41,230 --> 06:21:42,410
Wait, sniffing the ground for.

6201
06:21:47,890 --> 06:21:52,210
I need him to pee on my box so that we can get past the dogs
easily.

6202
06:22:17,050 --> 06:22:18,330
Oh yeah, I have to punch her.

6203
06:22:18,470 --> 06:22:19,130
That's right.

6204
06:22:19,890 --> 06:22:21,410
We punch her and then hide.

6205
06:22:22,710 --> 06:22:23,550
And then...

6206
06:22:23,550 --> 06:22:25,190
Wait, which way is it?

6207
06:22:28,210 --> 06:22:28,630
Wait.

6208
06:22:30,430 --> 06:22:31,970
It's so... I can't tell.

6209
06:22:32,150 --> 06:22:32,890
You know what, let's just go.

6210
06:22:33,570 --> 06:22:34,190
They're here?

6211
06:22:35,510 --> 06:22:36,510
Is this the correct spot?

6212
06:22:36,530 --> 06:22:36,930
What?

6213
06:22:38,390 --> 06:22:38,870
Uh...

6214
06:22:38,870 --> 06:22:39,350
Baby.

6215
06:22:44,690 --> 06:22:45,290
What's this?

6216
06:22:45,930 --> 06:22:46,950
Oh, this has a Mim.

6217
06:22:50,230 --> 06:22:50,710
Uh...

6218
06:22:50,710 --> 06:22:51,450
Nice.

6219
06:22:52,030 --> 06:22:53,190
Wait, is this a hole?

6220
06:22:54,010 --> 06:22:55,390
It's so hard to tell!

6221
06:22:55,830 --> 06:22:58,910
Oh my gosh, even in the original I can never remember.

6222
06:22:59,830 --> 06:23:00,450
Oh no.

6223
06:23:00,910 --> 06:23:01,630
Okay, hold on.

6224
06:23:05,690 --> 06:23:07,730
Oh, wait, this one, this one, this one.

6225
06:23:08,430 --> 06:23:08,730
Right?

6226
06:23:08,870 --> 06:23:09,130
Right?

6227
06:23:13,070 --> 06:23:15,810
Oh, yeah.

6228
06:23:20,640 --> 06:23:21,460
There she is.

6229
06:23:22,100 --> 06:23:22,560
And the dog.

6230
06:23:23,680 --> 06:23:24,220
The baby dog.

6231
06:23:24,960 --> 06:23:25,640
Oh, he likes...

6232
06:23:25,640 --> 06:23:26,400
Snake, what's wrong?

6233
06:23:26,640 --> 06:23:28,100
I thought you were good with dogs.

6234
06:23:29,100 --> 06:23:30,760
Why do they all like her?

6235
06:23:32,140 --> 06:23:33,380
It's because she's so cute.

6236
06:23:35,020 --> 06:23:36,120
Okay, so we gotta hit her.

6237
06:23:40,300 --> 06:23:40,780
Hide.

6238
06:23:41,500 --> 06:23:41,880
Hide!

6239
06:23:45,940 --> 06:23:46,660
I think I'm in trouble.

6240
06:23:49,480 --> 06:23:50,660
There's a whole cutscene.

6241
06:23:54,080 --> 06:23:55,160
Well, that didn't go as planned.

6242
06:23:56,120 --> 06:23:56,760
Too slow?

6243
06:24:00,980 --> 06:24:02,600
Okay, one more try, one more try.

6244
06:24:03,060 --> 06:24:03,940
I had it, I had it.

6245
06:24:03,960 --> 06:24:04,620
What are you thinking?

6246
06:24:04,940 --> 06:24:06,220
I had it, I had it, I had it.

6247
06:24:06,960 --> 06:24:07,920
You gotta get distant?

6248
06:24:14,540 --> 06:24:15,660
What are you doing?

6249
06:24:16,660 --> 06:24:17,580
Hold on, Meryl!

6250
06:24:20,720 --> 06:24:21,220
Ah!

6251
06:24:28,020 --> 06:24:29,880
Now they won't attack me.

6252
06:24:32,440 --> 06:24:32,800
Yay!

6253
06:24:33,500 --> 06:24:34,480
What are you doing?

6254
06:24:34,680 --> 06:24:34,900
Okay.

6255
06:24:35,260 --> 06:24:35,880
Come on, Meryl.

6256
06:24:36,100 --> 06:24:36,880
Let's get you...

6257
06:24:36,880 --> 06:24:37,580
Oh, sorry.

6258
06:24:39,280 --> 06:24:40,780
Let's get you in trouble.

6259
06:24:42,960 --> 06:24:44,620
We're so cute.

6260
06:24:45,580 --> 06:24:46,260
Okay.

6261
06:24:46,660 --> 06:24:48,300
I wish I could pet the dog.

6262
06:24:49,740 --> 06:24:51,140
Look how cute it is.

6263
06:24:51,940 --> 06:24:53,760
Oh my god, he's so cute.

6264
06:24:54,040 --> 06:24:54,420
Look at him.

6265
06:24:54,460 --> 06:24:55,400
He looks so happy.

6266
06:24:56,480 --> 06:24:58,120
Oh my gosh, so cute.

6267
06:24:58,280 --> 06:24:58,880
All right, let's go.

6268
06:25:07,650 --> 06:25:09,630
Okay, this place is mined.

6269
06:25:10,230 --> 06:25:11,110
I'll take point again.

6270
06:25:11,450 --> 06:25:12,310
Stay back, okay?

6271
06:25:12,570 --> 06:25:12,910
Okay.

6272
06:25:13,870 --> 06:25:15,270
But the radar isn't working.

6273
06:25:15,670 --> 06:25:17,650
And since we can't use the mind detector either.

6274
06:25:18,350 --> 06:25:18,630
No.

6275
06:25:21,090 --> 06:25:22,430
Leave it to me.

6276
06:25:51,340 --> 06:25:52,700
So what do you think?

6277
06:25:53,000 --> 06:25:53,700
Pretty good, huh?

6278
06:25:54,160 --> 06:25:55,480
How did you know where the mines were?

6279
06:25:55,960 --> 06:26:01,400
It sounds weird, but when Mantis dove into my mind, I was
able to see where the mines were placed.

6280
06:26:01,780 --> 06:26:02,700
Are you impressed?

6281
06:26:03,440 --> 06:26:05,040
Well, that odd caught me in the bite.

6282
06:26:05,380 --> 06:26:05,640
Ew!

6283
06:26:14,980 --> 06:26:17,020
Are you in front of me?

6284
06:26:19,260 --> 06:26:19,960
If...

6285
06:26:19,960 --> 06:26:20,200
Oh!

6286
06:26:23,220 --> 06:26:23,860
You know what?

6287
06:26:24,840 --> 06:26:26,000
It was worth that.

6288
06:26:27,300 --> 06:26:27,300
It

6289
06:26:31,740 --> 06:26:35,520
was worth that, I think.

6290
06:26:36,660 --> 06:26:37,380
Quite honestly.

6291
06:26:47,140 --> 06:26:47,840
Anyway...

6292
06:26:47,840 --> 06:26:48,800
Here I come!

6293
06:26:54,940 --> 06:26:59,620
Why are we, once again, standing in the middle of the way?

6294
06:27:00,520 --> 06:27:02,200
Why do we never learn our lesson?

6295
06:27:03,540 --> 06:27:03,960
Oh my god.

6296
06:27:04,140 --> 06:27:05,060
Why are you turning around?

6297
06:27:05,800 --> 06:27:06,120
No.

6298
06:27:07,180 --> 06:27:07,700
Oh my gosh.

6299
06:27:08,040 --> 06:27:08,300
Merrill.

6300
06:27:08,600 --> 06:27:08,900
Merrill.

6301
06:27:09,080 --> 06:27:09,480
Merrill.

6302
06:27:09,780 --> 06:27:10,020
Merrill.

6303
06:27:10,040 --> 06:27:13,840
Merrill, don't you know what that is?

6304
06:27:16,240 --> 06:27:18,540
Why are you guys just standing there?

6305
06:27:21,260 --> 06:27:22,400
Oh, she's actually...

6306
06:27:24,180 --> 06:27:26,060
She purposefully aimed for the leg

6307
06:27:32,060 --> 06:27:33,600
Oh my god

6308
06:27:40,020 --> 06:27:48,780
Like I know she wasn't trying to kill her Oh my god sniper
She's just getting every limb Dang Oh my gosh

6309
06:27:52,840 --> 06:28:03,620
Snipe for wool.

6310
06:28:08,000 --> 06:28:10,160
Snake, leave me and run.

6311
06:28:11,020 --> 06:28:11,400
Merle.

6312
06:28:11,680 --> 06:28:12,100
Merle.

6313
06:28:12,740 --> 06:28:16,260
I guess I'm a rookie after all.

6314
06:28:16,560 --> 06:28:19,340
Oh, well, both of you are for standing in the middle of the
way.

6315
06:28:20,780 --> 06:28:22,140
Even I know that.

6316
06:28:22,260 --> 06:28:22,900
Her leg.

6317
06:28:23,020 --> 06:28:24,580
It's the oldest trick in the book.

6318
06:28:25,380 --> 06:28:29,620
You guys, this is actually the last time we will see Merle.

6319
06:28:29,940 --> 06:28:31,880
Sniper's using me for bait to lure you out.

6320
06:28:31,900 --> 06:28:35,600
This is the last time we will see Meryl.

6321
06:28:37,340 --> 06:28:38,720
Shoot me, Snake.

6322
06:28:39,260 --> 06:28:39,540
No.

6323
06:28:43,120 --> 06:28:44,140
My gun.

6324
06:28:45,780 --> 06:28:47,720
I can't reach it but myself.

6325
06:28:47,720 --> 06:28:51,100
Since we're going for the autocon exit, exit ending.

6326
06:28:51,700 --> 06:28:54,660
I promised I wouldn't slow you down.

6327
06:28:56,480 --> 06:28:58,620
I, I can still help.

6328
06:28:58,720 --> 06:29:00,040
It's actually her.

6329
06:29:00,100 --> 06:29:00,940
I want to help you.

6330
06:29:01,040 --> 06:29:02,220
This is actually her death.

6331
06:29:02,540 --> 06:29:03,040
It's so sad.

6332
06:29:03,460 --> 06:29:05,200
It's actually so sad.

6333
06:29:06,000 --> 06:29:06,800
Bye, Meryl.

6334
06:29:06,980 --> 06:29:07,920
I was a fool.

6335
06:29:08,360 --> 06:29:10,720
I wanted to be a soldier.

6336
06:29:11,000 --> 06:29:11,700
I'm sorry.

6337
06:29:13,260 --> 06:29:14,560
I'm sorry, Meryl.

6338
06:29:15,560 --> 06:29:15,600
Oh!

6339
06:29:17,080 --> 06:29:18,680
War is meaningless.

6340
06:29:20,060 --> 06:29:21,460
Nothing comes out of war.

6341
06:29:23,580 --> 06:29:24,860
Oh, the...

6342
06:29:25,280 --> 06:29:25,600
Ew.

6343
06:29:26,320 --> 06:29:29,720
It's so like sad watching her trying to reach for her gun.

6344
06:29:29,820 --> 06:29:30,840
Don't give up on people.

6345
06:29:30,840 --> 06:29:31,600
So sad.

6346
06:29:34,540 --> 06:29:35,720
Don't forget me.

6347
06:29:39,560 --> 06:29:42,600
She'd been so dramatic despite dying.

6348
06:29:43,280 --> 06:29:44,640
Gosh, why are you going to be so dramatic, Meryl?

6349
06:29:46,200 --> 06:29:48,500
No, get out of here.

6350
06:29:56,910 --> 06:29:58,830
I love that scene in the original.

6351
06:29:59,110 --> 06:29:59,230
Meryl?

6352
06:29:59,710 --> 06:29:59,890
Colonel?

6353
06:30:00,870 --> 06:30:01,350
Damn.

6354
06:30:02,190 --> 06:30:03,510
Snake, it's a trap.

6355
06:30:03,890 --> 06:30:04,590
Who just said Colonel?

6356
06:30:04,910 --> 06:30:05,870
The sniper's trick to lure you out.

6357
06:30:06,610 --> 06:30:09,770
The sniper's waiting for you to go to help Meryl so he can
kick you off.

6358
06:30:10,810 --> 06:30:19,790
it it must be sniper wolf foxhound's best shooter snipers
usually work in pairs who said Colonel I know her Naomi

6359
06:30:19,790 --> 06:30:26,930
maybe for hours days or weeks it was like a woman's voice
she's just watching and waiting for you to expose yourself

6360
06:30:26,930 --> 06:30:34,650
not snake maybe so but Mara can't hold out that long snake
can you see wolf from where you are there's nowhere to hide

6361
06:30:34,650 --> 06:30:42,590
between here and the tower she must be on the second floor
of the tower if wolf is in the you perfectly it's a classic

6362
06:30:42,590 --> 06:30:47,870
sniper's position classic at that distance you won't be able
to hit her with a standard weapon either you'll need a

6363
06:30:47,870 --> 06:31:01,590
sniper rifle the pst take it easy i'm going to save maryl no
matter what it takes okay thanks um what's wrong naomi pop

6364
06:31:01,590 --> 06:31:08,790
pop don't you know there's a tendency toward murder written
in your very genes so saving someone else's skin is out of

6365
06:31:08,790 --> 06:31:14,210
the question why are you gonna bring that up that I don't
know what the hell my genes look like and I don't care you

6366
06:31:14,210 --> 06:31:22,630
hate me so much Naomi like an animal I'm going to save
Merrill I don't need an excuse okay and I'm not doing it for

6367
06:31:22,630 --> 06:31:31,590
someone else either I'm going to save Merrill for myself
about that don't worry about that thanks I understand don't

6368
06:31:31,590 --> 06:31:37,730
don't thank me yet don't thank me yet Colonel you have no
reason to thank me

6369
06:31:54,250 --> 06:32:02,310
I love that scene in the original where like the codec is
just like going off over and over again and snake is just

6370
06:32:02,310 --> 06:32:04,770
sitting there like Oh my god, what do I do?

6371
06:32:04,930 --> 06:32:05,670
What do I do?

6372
06:32:05,670 --> 06:32:07,050
Like he's just he's not moving.

6373
06:32:07,230 --> 06:32:08,050
He's just like thinking.

6374
06:32:08,350 --> 06:32:08,670
Ah!

6375
06:32:18,030 --> 06:32:19,090
Wait, don't you like?

6376
06:32:19,610 --> 06:32:22,010
Oh, who who caught me then?

6377
06:32:24,650 --> 06:32:28,510
Oh my gosh, you are freaking me out little pup!

6378
06:32:29,110 --> 06:32:29,590
Please!

6379
06:32:41,190 --> 06:32:44,730
Those dogs after getting a whiff of newly-scented box on
snake.

6380
06:32:46,590 --> 06:32:47,870
Time to leave.

6381
06:33:07,850 --> 06:33:08,930
We're good now.

6382
06:33:11,170 --> 06:33:11,910
Everything's fine now.

6383
06:33:12,150 --> 06:33:12,370
What's this?

6384
06:33:12,910 --> 06:33:13,590
Oh, Fama's.

6385
06:33:13,670 --> 06:33:14,010
Sorry, guys.

6386
06:33:15,110 --> 06:33:16,110
Can always use more of that.

6387
06:33:16,230 --> 06:33:17,610
This is the PSG, okay.

6388
06:33:20,430 --> 06:33:21,570
Is that an exit?

6389
06:33:22,850 --> 06:33:23,610
Right there?

6390
06:33:25,010 --> 06:33:26,210
What is...

6391
06:33:26,210 --> 06:33:27,850
Oh, I guess there's nothing here.

6392
06:33:31,590 --> 06:33:31,830
Okay.

6393
06:33:32,230 --> 06:33:32,470
Go.

6394
06:33:34,590 --> 06:33:36,450
Go crawl, crawl, stay crawl!

6395
06:33:40,090 --> 06:33:41,310
Okay, nice.

6396
06:33:42,150 --> 06:33:42,390
See?

6397
06:33:42,630 --> 06:33:44,710
That's why the box was important, everybody.

6398
06:33:47,810 --> 06:33:49,870
That's why the box was so important.

6399
06:33:51,970 --> 06:33:53,590
Dogs just running around in circles.

6400
06:33:55,650 --> 06:33:56,130
Okay.

6401
06:33:57,630 --> 06:33:58,110
Okay.

6402
06:33:59,190 --> 06:34:02,230
We have to go all the way back to the...

6403
06:34:02,230 --> 06:34:03,230
Oh my goodness.

6404
06:34:03,790 --> 06:34:04,970
I can't find where the door is.

6405
06:34:05,210 --> 06:34:07,450
I have to go all the way back to the...

6406
06:34:08,530 --> 06:34:09,850
To the armory?

6407
06:34:10,870 --> 06:34:16,110
But we will do that next time.

6408
06:34:16,790 --> 06:34:18,110
even though I want to keep playing.

6409
06:34:18,370 --> 06:34:22,130
We will do that next time.

6410
06:34:22,310 --> 06:34:24,250
It's rumbling in my ears again.

6411
06:34:24,690 --> 06:34:25,330
What is this thing?

6412
06:34:25,430 --> 06:34:26,010
Is that a phone?

6413
06:34:26,910 --> 06:34:27,290
Old.

6414
06:34:28,250 --> 06:34:30,450
Oh, there's stuff on the...

6415
06:34:33,550 --> 06:34:34,710
Oh, it's freaky.

6416
06:34:36,750 --> 06:34:37,190
Wait.

6417
06:34:38,870 --> 06:34:40,330
Oh, the mirror's all broken too.

6418
06:34:40,430 --> 06:34:41,550
He doesn't like to see himself.

6419
06:34:44,530 --> 06:34:46,390
What the heck is this thing?

6420
06:34:46,570 --> 06:34:48,230
I was wondering that before.

6421
06:34:48,670 --> 06:34:51,750
Was this in the Oh, that's the communications tower, isn't
it?

6422
06:34:53,310 --> 06:34:53,390
Cut.

6423
06:34:53,990 --> 06:34:56,110
We fight the hindee up there, right?

6424
06:34:57,330 --> 06:34:58,650
Oh, that's kind of funny.

6425
06:35:03,210 --> 06:35:03,930
Oh, fun.

6426
06:35:06,530 --> 06:35:07,090
Interesting.

6427
06:35:10,930 --> 06:35:13,570
Are those the giant staircases you climb?

6428
06:35:14,590 --> 06:35:14,970
Yes.

6429
06:35:15,210 --> 06:35:17,330
And I think we have...

6430
06:35:17,330 --> 06:35:18,250
Oh, yeah.

6431
06:35:19,110 --> 06:35:21,030
We have 14 chaff grenades.

6432
06:35:21,610 --> 06:35:22,790
We're doing well.

6433
06:35:23,650 --> 06:35:24,750
We're doing alright.

6434
06:35:25,570 --> 06:35:27,050
Wait, are there any...

6435
06:35:27,050 --> 06:35:29,170
Are we still alone in here or...

6436
06:35:29,170 --> 06:35:29,910
Oh.

6437
06:35:30,430 --> 06:35:31,030
No, we're not.

6438
06:35:31,310 --> 06:35:31,470
Okay.

6439
06:35:32,630 --> 06:35:33,650
Gonna go here.

6440
06:35:35,830 --> 06:35:36,570
Okay, yeah.

6441
06:35:36,730 --> 06:35:37,810
We're gonna go back inside.

6442
06:35:37,970 --> 06:35:38,650
I'm gonna save.

6443
06:35:43,500 --> 06:35:43,640
Oh.

6444
06:35:44,200 --> 06:35:44,640
Save.

6445
06:35:44,740 --> 06:35:45,340
Save, save.

6446
06:35:46,820 --> 06:35:47,540
And, um...

6447
06:35:47,540 --> 06:35:49,060
Yeah, we'll finish it off here.

6448
06:35:50,540 --> 06:35:51,360
You call it, Snake?

6449
06:35:51,800 --> 06:35:52,000
Yep.

6450
06:35:52,520 --> 06:35:52,960
Yep.

6451
06:35:59,130 --> 06:35:59,770
Nice.

6452
06:36:01,450 --> 06:36:02,230
Save complete.

6453
06:36:04,470 --> 06:36:08,150
The Chinese say it is the strong swimmer who most often
drowns.

6454
06:36:08,430 --> 06:36:13,570
It's because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities
and underestimates the strength of the river.

6455
06:36:14,090 --> 06:36:17,150
You're probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get
careless.

6456
06:36:17,470 --> 06:36:18,650
No, I'm not careless.

6457
06:36:19,150 --> 06:36:20,090
I'm very careful.

6458
06:36:21,850 --> 06:36:23,430
Do you remember what day tomorrow is?

6459
06:36:24,770 --> 06:36:33,650
um you know I thought about maybe if I finish this next week
maybe doing like um like playing Metal Gear Solid like

6460
06:36:33,650 --> 06:36:39,770
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or I don't know I don't know how
long it would take me maybe even like Saturday, Sunday,

6461
06:36:39,810 --> 06:36:49,410
Monday, Tuesday of uh like the 27th, 28th, 29th 30th so
maybe because I knew the other day I was just like oh my

6462
06:36:49,410 --> 06:36:59,850
gosh it's April I can do April 30th So, um, the OG, of
course, I mean, well, actually, it would probably be the

6463
06:36:59,850 --> 06:37:00,550
Master Collection.

6464
06:37:01,230 --> 06:37:06,770
Uh, or, I already, I've done the, uh, the HD Collection.

6465
06:37:07,030 --> 06:37:08,150
Probably will be the Master Collection.

6466
06:37:09,090 --> 06:37:16,450
But, um, depends on how, how, I don't know, I don't know if
I would need four days.

6467
06:37:16,530 --> 06:37:20,370
I guess it depends on how much I play each day, right, and
how, how well I do.

6468
06:37:23,430 --> 06:37:28,050
I think I'll, I don't know, we might do it, who knows, but,
um,

6469
06:37:31,310 --> 06:37:33,490
um, the master collection kind of poopy.

6470
06:37:33,570 --> 06:37:34,610
No, they fixed it.

6471
06:37:34,910 --> 06:37:37,090
They, they have, they have done a lot of patches.

6472
06:37:37,370 --> 06:37:43,170
I think it's most, I think it's, I think it's like pretty
much up to speed now from what I understand.

6473
06:37:44,890 --> 06:37:54,930
Like they've done a lot of, a lot of patches on it, so, um,
updates are great, yeah, That was good run, Min.

6474
06:37:54,950 --> 06:37:55,750
Thank you!

6475
06:37:56,110 --> 06:37:57,270
Andrigos, thanks for the 10 gift!

6476
06:37:57,410 --> 06:37:57,910
Thank you!

6477
06:37:59,210 --> 06:38:01,430
I do want to keep playing, but...

6478
06:38:03,050 --> 06:38:06,330
I am still not sure about a stream tomorrow.

6479
06:38:06,650 --> 06:38:09,570
Actually, there's actually something I kind of want to play.

6480
06:38:10,050 --> 06:38:13,570
There was a new, um, Hollow Indie game that came out.

6481
06:38:13,750 --> 06:38:15,610
Like the, wow, wow, Korone...

6482
06:38:17,750 --> 06:38:18,270
Korone...

6483
06:38:18,270 --> 06:38:18,270
Box?

6484
06:38:18,850 --> 06:38:19,330
Hold on.

6485
06:38:19,490 --> 06:38:20,070
What is it called?

6486
06:38:22,270 --> 06:38:22,790
Korone...

6487
06:38:23,710 --> 06:38:27,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,
wow, wow, wow, because I was thinking of playing that

6488
06:38:27,970 --> 06:38:38,450
tomorrow, so, um, since I didn't have a game planned or
anything, um, so, I'm not sure what time yet, uh, might

6489
06:38:38,450 --> 06:38:47,690
start, actually, around the same time as today's stream, so,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and, uh, but it looks really fun and

6490
06:38:47,690 --> 06:38:56,350
really cute, so I wanted to try it out, and I love Korone,
son, so, mm-hmm, I haven't seen it yet, so that'd be good to

6491
06:38:56,350 --> 06:38:56,530
see.

6492
06:38:56,650 --> 06:38:58,170
Yeah, yeah, I want to try it.

6493
06:38:58,530 --> 06:38:59,430
It looks so fine.

6494
06:39:01,950 --> 06:39:03,690
And yeah.

6495
06:39:07,570 --> 06:39:10,370
Methanar, thank you for the tan gift in.

6496
06:39:10,510 --> 06:39:11,050
Thank you.

6497
06:39:11,430 --> 06:39:12,350
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

6498
06:39:13,330 --> 06:39:15,190
I saw that she got a new outfit today.

6499
06:39:15,470 --> 06:39:17,590
It's so, it's not what I expected.

6500
06:39:17,910 --> 06:39:19,910
Like, it's so, it's so cool.

6501
06:39:20,410 --> 06:39:27,830
The Viking style It's so... I like her how messy and like
shaggy her hair is.

6502
06:39:28,010 --> 06:39:28,830
It's really cute.

6503
06:39:30,390 --> 06:39:31,230
So yeah.

6504
06:39:31,790 --> 06:39:32,810
It's so her too.

6505
06:39:33,430 --> 06:39:33,630
Yeah.

6506
06:39:35,030 --> 06:39:36,890
The Vinland Saga fit.

6507
06:39:38,570 --> 06:39:39,170
Her new song?

6508
06:39:39,310 --> 06:39:39,610
Oh wait.

6509
06:39:40,410 --> 06:39:44,050
I don't... I don't... I don't... I don't know if I heard her
new song.

6510
06:39:45,810 --> 06:39:49,250
I'm not gonna listen to it here, but...

6511
06:39:50,630 --> 06:39:51,150
Oh,

6512
06:39:55,670 --> 06:39:56,030
trouble with...

6513
06:39:56,930 --> 06:39:57,490
Wander.

6514
06:39:57,770 --> 06:39:58,490
That's so cute.

6515
06:40:00,130 --> 06:40:01,210
I will listen to it.

6516
06:40:06,130 --> 06:40:06,970
But yeah.

6517
06:40:07,750 --> 06:40:10,310
Glad we got to watch you play Twin Snakes at last.

6518
06:40:10,410 --> 06:40:11,250
Me too.

6519
06:40:11,650 --> 06:40:12,050
Oh my gosh.

6520
06:40:12,170 --> 06:40:14,110
The cutscenes are killing me.

6521
06:40:14,170 --> 06:40:15,830
Each time they're so crazy.

6522
06:40:16,030 --> 06:40:16,890
It's so much fun.

6523
06:40:17,410 --> 06:40:19,130
They're so so so fun.

6524
06:40:21,090 --> 06:40:23,670
Like they're so outlandish.

6525
06:40:23,770 --> 06:40:24,250
I love them.

6526
06:40:26,270 --> 06:40:27,230
For real.

6527
06:40:28,510 --> 06:40:29,530
Thank you, Marilyn!

6528
06:40:31,010 --> 06:40:31,570
Thank you for the stream.

6529
06:40:31,710 --> 06:40:33,610
You can never have enough MGS.

6530
06:40:33,830 --> 06:40:35,750
Those laughing pictures from the Mantis fight will give
you...

6531
06:40:35,750 --> 06:40:37,330
Those are really creepy.

6532
06:40:37,510 --> 06:40:39,830
I did not expect that.

6533
06:40:41,370 --> 06:40:42,070
I did not.

6534
06:40:42,410 --> 06:40:43,430
It was freaky.

6535
06:40:43,890 --> 06:40:44,750
It was freaky, freaky.

6536
06:40:47,050 --> 06:40:48,230
But, yeah.

6537
06:40:49,930 --> 06:40:52,510
Still so surreal seeing this game in, like, HD.

6538
06:40:53,010 --> 06:40:53,470
It's cool.

6539
06:40:53,650 --> 06:40:54,850
It is very different.

6540
06:40:56,050 --> 06:41:06,890
the original but I'm glad it exists me too I agree I think I
like obviously I don't say I don't say like this is a you

6541
06:41:06,890 --> 06:41:15,870
know a remake remake that's why I'm very interested in what
it's in what MGS 3 Delta will be like you know I don't think

6542
06:41:15,870 --> 06:41:25,390
it'll I mean I don't know I don't think it'll be like this
but it seems like they're remaining true to the original so

6543
06:41:25,390 --> 06:41:36,130
i'm very curious like if it's just gonna be the same game
but maybe hopefully with like uh better gameplay and um just

6544
06:41:36,130 --> 06:41:46,710
like the cut scenes all the same just hd graphics thank you
for the 50 gifted thank you thank you so much i wouldn't i

6545
06:41:46,710 --> 06:41:59,990
wouldn't really want it to be like this so um but we shall
see I suppose we shall see this one it does the cut scenes

6546
06:41:59,990 --> 06:42:06,530
do feel really weird because like the tone is just
completely different in the original like you can feel like

6547
06:42:06,530 --> 06:42:18,650
this cold hollow net hollowness you know like because the
audio is so like it's echoey and it's and it just feels like

6548
06:42:18,650 --> 06:42:28,610
so different and like so each has a different energy like
this one is so much more action and crazy outlandish but so

6549
06:42:28,610 --> 06:42:36,590
it's not i don't think i it's like i don't prefer this one
but i also still love this one because it's so funny yeah

6550
06:42:36,590 --> 06:42:46,270
way different atmosphere yeah and the music in the first one
so it just hits so good like it just even for me when i was

6551
06:42:46,270 --> 06:42:47,430
first playing it like

6552
06:42:50,690 --> 06:42:59,570
I never even seen footage of it as a kid Like I never
touched it until I first played it But like it still felt

6553
06:42:59,570 --> 06:43:11,830
like nostalgic There's just something about it Then I did
like Psycho Mantis's Remix That was cool But still it's

6554
06:43:11,830 --> 06:43:21,650
different Yeah Humma, humma, humma, humma Humma, humma,
humma Twin Snake seems pretty great so far.

6555
06:43:21,970 --> 06:43:22,930
It is a lot of fun.

6556
06:43:23,310 --> 06:43:24,090
It is a lot of fun.

6557
06:43:24,270 --> 06:43:36,410
It's, uh, I'm, I'm, uh, kind of like, oh, if I play this and
then play MGS2 next, maybe I won't, like, uh, well, the

6558
06:43:36,410 --> 06:43:43,490
controls will be, uh, a little different, but maybe it'll,
it'll be like more, I'll be a little bit more used to it.

6559
06:43:45,270 --> 06:43:48,430
Because I have not, I have not touched MGS2.

6560
06:43:49,750 --> 06:43:51,250
I last played it.

6561
06:43:52,830 --> 06:43:57,650
Twin Snake seems like Otakon retelling the story to add his
Otaku-Weep flair to the reality of what actually happened.

6562
06:43:57,910 --> 06:43:59,350
That's my favorite theory.

6563
06:44:00,130 --> 06:44:01,170
That's my favorite theory.

6564
06:44:06,780 --> 06:44:07,240
Mint Doka?

6565
06:44:07,700 --> 06:44:08,320
Mint Coco!

6566
06:44:09,880 --> 06:44:18,200
But yeah, thank you guys for hanging out with me, with
playing this, and I think I'm going to go to bed.

6567
06:44:19,800 --> 06:44:21,080
I was a little late.

6568
06:44:21,900 --> 06:44:22,920
for a stream today.

6569
06:44:23,140 --> 06:44:24,820
I had to delay it by about 45 minutes.

6570
06:44:25,260 --> 06:44:28,060
Which again, uh, actually, I don't think I apologized for
that in the beginning.

6571
06:44:28,200 --> 06:44:28,940
I'm so sorry.

6572
06:44:29,260 --> 06:44:31,420
I'm so sorry that I was late.

6573
06:44:32,360 --> 06:44:34,920
I had some errands and, um, hold on.

6574
06:44:35,560 --> 06:44:38,100
Uh, let me, I did save, right?

6575
06:44:38,160 --> 06:44:44,160
I'm actually, I plan on talking just a little tiny bit more,
but I'm actually going to turn off the GameCube because, uh,

6576
06:44:44,200 --> 06:44:53,700
I don't want it to I'm gonna just turn it off.

6577
06:44:55,400 --> 06:44:56,160
Okay.

6578
06:45:05,460 --> 06:45:08,160
So I was a little bit late.

6579
06:45:10,660 --> 06:45:12,240
But I cannot say why.

6580
06:45:15,480 --> 06:45:16,240
I

6581
06:45:19,680 --> 06:45:22,960
cannot say why I was a little bit late.

6582
06:45:24,460 --> 06:45:25,020
Hmm.

6583
06:45:26,060 --> 06:45:26,300
Hmm.

6584
06:45:26,960 --> 06:45:27,140

Mysterious.

6587
06:45:28,900 --> 06:45:29,460
Curious.

6588
06:45:30,060 --> 06:45:30,580
Yes.

6589
06:45:30,800 --> 06:45:32,260
I had some errands.

6590
06:45:32,540 --> 06:45:32,880
I went out.

6591
06:45:33,100 --> 06:45:35,740
I went out of my maid cafe.

6592
06:45:35,940 --> 06:45:37,600
We did a little bit of outside haunting.

6593
06:45:39,020 --> 06:45:39,460
Hmm.

6594
06:45:40,500 --> 06:45:40,700

Can't wait for April 30th.

6616
06:48:22,650 --> 06:48:23,690
April 30th.

6617
06:48:25,010 --> 06:48:30,570
I almost am just like, yeah, I can wait because I have so
much that I need to plan and think of.

6618
06:48:31,510 --> 06:48:34,930
But I'm like, wait, I want time to slow down a little bit.

6619
06:48:36,330 --> 06:48:55,350
I don't need it to go so quickly but um hopefully uh but the
brain rot i missed you like i missed that raft you belong on

6620
06:48:55,350 --> 06:48:59,710
you belong on this boat

6621
06:49:03,690 --> 06:49:12,290
man came back just to say thanks for the stream thank you
thank you thank you time either goes too fast or too slow I

6622
06:49:12,290 --> 06:49:12,630
know.

6623
06:49:14,310 --> 06:49:19,790
Sometimes, though, if it's too slow, you gotta just think
and be like, okay, you know what?

6624
06:49:20,330 --> 06:49:23,190
It might be something that I'm doing that I don't like.

6625
06:49:23,630 --> 06:49:26,170
And it's going too slow and I just want it to pass.

6626
06:49:26,630 --> 06:49:35,790
But at the same time, you should appreciate the slow times
too, because, um, you know, then if you're just like, when

6627
06:49:35,790 --> 06:49:44,290
it gets too fast, it's too, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
It's hard to notice.

6628
06:49:44,410 --> 06:49:48,010
It's hard to notice things in the moment when things are too
fast.

6629
06:49:48,830 --> 06:49:49,030
You know?

6630
06:49:49,410 --> 06:49:50,350
Like a kidney stone.

6631
06:49:50,830 --> 06:49:53,210
If you have a kidney stone, go on a roller coaster.

6632
06:49:55,910 --> 06:49:57,330
Like, I think, what is it?

6633
06:49:57,590 --> 06:50:01,110
Thunder Mountain third seat from the last or something?

6634
06:50:02,190 --> 06:50:02,770
What's your sub?

6635
06:50:03,410 --> 06:50:03,810
Huh?

6636
06:50:03,990 --> 06:50:04,190
What?

6637
06:50:04,270 --> 06:50:04,450
Yeah.

6638
06:50:04,610 --> 06:50:09,490
If you have a kidney stone, some doctors actually, I want to
say doctors.

6639
06:50:09,770 --> 06:50:10,050
You know what?

6640
06:50:10,050 --> 06:50:11,690
I'm not a doctor, so don't listen to that.

6641
06:50:11,970 --> 06:50:24,190
uh some things do uh i have read that that it is also said
that you should go on a on like certain roller coasters that

6642
06:50:24,190 --> 06:50:33,490
will help dislodge it i feel like 2024 just came but now
it's already april i know i know right well i mean i spent

6643
06:50:33,490 --> 06:50:39,490
two months in japan and that flew by so quickly so to me i I
can't even believe it's April.

6644
06:50:40,270 --> 06:50:41,610
Mid-April, I thought.

6645
06:50:42,850 --> 06:50:43,290
Disclaimer.

6646
06:50:43,450 --> 06:50:44,530
Mint is not a doctor.

6647
06:50:44,930 --> 06:50:45,930
No, I am a ghost maid.

6648
06:50:46,150 --> 06:50:47,050
I am not a doctor.

6649
06:50:51,710 --> 06:50:51,870
Hmm.

6650
06:50:53,110 --> 06:50:53,210
Hmm.

6651
06:50:56,710 --> 06:50:57,050
Hmm.

6652
06:50:57,110 --> 06:50:57,130
Hmm.

6653
06:51:05,050 --> 06:51:05,490
Yet.

6654
06:51:16,880 --> 06:51:18,460
With jumping out of a plane work.

6655
06:51:18,600 --> 06:51:23,520
No, I think you actually need like the bumpiness of a roller
coaster to dislodge it.

6656
06:51:24,180 --> 06:51:26,100
Like, look it up, look it up, look it up.

6657
06:51:28,300 --> 06:51:29,860
Sakura, I'm here to go.

6658
06:51:31,160 --> 06:51:31,640
Sooooo!

6659
06:51:32,800 --> 06:51:33,760

06:51:35,460 --> 06:51:35,940
ZANENNANO.

6661
06:51:36,120 --> 06:51:37,040
Well, it's okay.

6662
06:51:38,720 --> 06:51:42,960
Next year, there's a lot of fun.

6663
06:51:42,960 --> 06:51:46,720
And I've been having a lot of fun since you've been back

6664
06:51:46,720 --> 06:51:47,320

6665

6666
06:51:48,900 --> 06:51:52,360

6667
06:51:56,060 --> 06:51:57,140
stop it

6668
06:52:00,920 --> 06:52:07,840
I don't need excuses to go on a roller coaster all I'm
saying is that it could help if you have a kidney stone it

6669
06:52:07,840 --> 06:52:11,310
could help not 100% but you know

6670
06:52:16,380 --> 06:52:20,900
yeah yeah Hi, Asu!

6671
06:52:24,960 --> 06:52:26,000
Hot nursement.

6672
06:52:26,960 --> 06:52:27,100
What?

6673
06:52:31,350 --> 06:52:34,470
Tomorrow, like I said, I think I'll be streaming same
time-ish.

6674
06:52:34,590 --> 06:52:38,390
Not as on the schedule, but as when I started the stream.

6675
06:52:38,750 --> 06:52:40,310
So, about 4 p.m.

6676
06:52:40,490 --> 06:52:41,010
EST.

6677
06:52:41,530 --> 06:52:42,710
I'll make a waiting room for it tonight.

6678
06:52:44,770 --> 06:52:47,250
But as usual, I probably won't be streaming on Monday.

6679
06:52:49,070 --> 06:52:49,590

6684
06:53:23,050 --> 06:53:24,690
Three months ago?

6685
06:53:24,850 --> 06:53:25,610

6686
06:53:25,610 --> 06:53:26,890
So it's recent, huh?

6687

6688
06:53:30,090 --> 06:53:32,670
When I come back and suddenly everyone's like, I'm yapping.

6689
06:53:33,570 --> 06:53:34,830
I'm yapping here.

6690
06:53:36,690 --> 06:53:39,010
When the Twitch emote got popular.

6691
06:53:39,290 --> 06:53:40,970
Oh, it's a Twitch emote.

6692
06:53:41,810 --> 06:53:47,950

6693
06:53:48,950 --> 06:53:50,110
