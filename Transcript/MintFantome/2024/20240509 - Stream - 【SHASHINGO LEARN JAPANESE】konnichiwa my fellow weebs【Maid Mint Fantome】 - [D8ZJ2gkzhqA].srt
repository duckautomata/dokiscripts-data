00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,790
Hello, hello, hello, hello,

00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,090

3
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,550
What's the pun?

4
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,530

5
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,210

00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,170
Shashingo.

7
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,400
Or if it's Shashingo, wouldn't it be like photography
language?

8
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,500
Teach us Nihongo.

9
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,220
Kyowa.

10
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,920
Kyowa, Nihongo.

11
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,000
In this game, you take pictures and you learn Japanese.

12
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,900
Let's all be weeps together.

13
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,620
Wow.

00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,240

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,920
Oh, thank you very much.

17
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,460
That's such a good thank you, isn't it?

18
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,740
Wow, it's super good.

19
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,080
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,180
Uh, yeah, yeah, still, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,500
What?

22
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,280
What?

23
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:51,720
Oh, what?

24
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,900
My Nihonko is very sugoi.

25
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,400
I believe you!

26
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,380
I believe you.

27
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,460
Actually, yesterday...

28
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,060
Was it yesterday?

29
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,400
Yes.

30
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,740
Yesterday, Matara and I, we both bought our...

31
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,840
Our... Oh, sorry.

32
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,060
Something fell on my desk.

33
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,160
Our tickets to Japan!

34
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,760
So before...

35
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,980
Kanji mo yommerun da.

36
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,140
Sugoi.

37
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:19,960
Kanji...

38
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,280
Kanji yommerasen.

39
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,020
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

41
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,560
Oh, let me know.

42
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,140
Nihonko!

43
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,200
Yeah, we bought our tickets to Japan, so now it feels so
much more real.

44
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:37,960
But...

45
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,220
Oh, my gosh, this music's going to put me to sleep.

46
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:42,840
Um...

47
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:43,800
Uh...

48
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,220
Um...

49
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,860
Uh, what was I going to say?

50
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,460
It was so funny.

51
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,580
When we were buying them, we were buying them together.

52
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:01,840
and i bought mine i ended up like like i ended up putting in
all my information first and buying my ticket first and then

53
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:13,140
she goes to buy hers and we got ours separately but um we
put our seats next to each other and um and uh when she went

54
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:21,840
to go buy hers it said that it was sold out So I was like,
oh, I didn't take it.

55
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,500
I didn't take it.

56
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,760
I didn't take it.

57
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,980
But in the end, it worked out.

58
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,960
It was too slow.

59
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,400
I took her seat.

60
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,080
Oh, no.

61
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,960
Japan, it's hot.

62
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,840
Oh, man.

63
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,440
This is hot.

64
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,220
Oh my gosh, that scared me.

65
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,720
I like the lo-fi of this.

66
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,720
I really wanted, like, a kind of chill game.

67
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:05,940
And, uh, um, something that, uh, uh, Riguma, Shiterno?

68
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,800
Riguma!

69
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,600
Riguma!

70
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,440
Riguma!

71
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,620
Um, uh, what's his name?

72
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,100
Oh, no.

73
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,020
Um, oh, Steve Jobs!

74
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,120
Who

75
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,480
is Steve Jobs?

76
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,960
Miigmaq is an English meme.

77
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,520
It's an English meme.

78
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,780
Don't worry about it.

79
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,520
Who is Steve Jobs?

80
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,100
Who is Steve Jobs?

81
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,220
Who?

82
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,040
Steve Jobs.

83
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,120
But yeah, yesterday I talked so much.

84
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,900
I wanted something today that is a little less, like, a
little less talk-intensive and a little more chill and a

85
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,360
little more.

86
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,520
Just going around and learning some Nihon Go.

87
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,220
And we can study...

88
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,440
Kimi No Nihon Go Honto Ni Jozu.

89
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,000
Thank you.

90
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:20,680
Hi, Minto.

91
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,860
Today is actually my birthday, so I can ask her a happy
birthday from Portia Ridge.

92
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,320
Oh my gosh, happy birthday!

93
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,920
Happy birthday to you.

94
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,780
Oh, happy birthday to you.

95
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,180
Happy birthday, David, Ty, Taney, and Pee-Pee.

96
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Happy birthday.

97
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,460
Oh, to you, you little peasant.

98
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,710
Thank you, gozhu.

99
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,770
Thank you, gozhu.

100
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,710
Thank you, gozhu.

101
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,530
Thank you.

102
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,270
Hi, Mint.

103
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:07,850
Hello.

104
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,210
Hi, little boy.

105
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,450
Posh voice, jozhu.

106
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,710
Everything is jozhu.

107
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,870
And not everything can be jozhu.

108
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,850
Not everything can be jozhu.

109
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,130
Let's do it again.

110
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,630
Japan has over 5 mil...

111
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:27,770
Oh.

112
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,950
Oh my god, it's so loud.

113
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,630
It's raining!

114
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,590
Welcome to Shashingo!

115
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,830
Here you'll use your camera to create unique photo
flashcards for learning Japanese.

116
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,630
You're free to explore your surroundings and study at your
own pace without any pressure.

117
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:45,450
Oh!

118
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,790
In-world translations!

119
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:51,470
Besides learning new vocabulary with your camera, you also
come across Japanese texts in various places while

120
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,010
exploring.

121
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:57,330
Interacting with the text will allow you to view the
original Japanese text along with the translation.

122
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,750
Oh my gosh!

123
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,430
I can't hear you over the sounds of Japan.

124
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,630
5 million, what?

125
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,150
5 million!

126
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,950
5 million!

127
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,610
I'll give you this joke one more try before retiring it.

128
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,670
I apologize.

129
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,140
What?

130
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:45,740
What?

131
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,460
Oh my gosh, it's so quiet because...

132
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:03,760
Hold on.

133
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,660
I'm gonna get through.

134
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,700
Let me get through this real quick and then I'll turn the
sound down.

135
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,260
Open your camera when you're ready.

136
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,200
Learn how to use it.

137
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,940
Okay, hold on.

138
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,460
Oh!

139
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,000
Maid, Maid Dreamin!

140
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,340
I'm sorry, Maid Melody.

141
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,120
Okay, audio.

142
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,820
Oh, there we go.

143
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,700
Oh, my God.

144
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,100
Peace.

145
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,840
This is, like, going to real Japan.

146
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,260
This is, like, real.

147
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,900
This is, like, going to real.

148
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,140
Wow, the first thing we see is a Maid Campari!

149
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, my gosh!

150
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,240
Maid, main melody, main melody.

151
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,220
Oh my gosh!

152
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,580
Ah!

153
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,800
Very good.

154
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,860
Where are we?

155
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,900
I wonder.

156
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:58,980
Hmm.

157
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,960
I wonder where we are.

158
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,720
Oh wait, how do I...

159
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,420
Oh, right click is uh...

160
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:07,640
What?

161
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,640
Rainbow team.

162
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,120
Hey, that's not Japanese.

163
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,020
That's not Nihon-go.

164
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:16,760
Let's see.

165
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,920
What do we...

166
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,320
Let's take a picture of the maids.

167
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,520
Oh, operating the camera.

168
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,380
Operating the camera is easy and there are only a few
buttons to remember.

169
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,540
To take a photo, simply frame your subject by adjusting your
position and go and zoom.

170
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,520
Then press the shutter button when you're ready.

171
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,440
Oh, there's filters.

172
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,100
Oh my gosh.

173
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,200
You'll get kicked out if you take a picture of them.

174
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,980
You're so right.

175
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,720
Don't take pictures of the maids, you guys.

176
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,200
While it's not mandatory, holding the shutter button allows
you to lock up.

177
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,320
Lock on.

178
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,720
I'm locking.

179
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,860
Lock on.

180
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,580
You can adjust the composition even more freely.

181
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:00,980
Release the shutter button.

182
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,860
Oh, releasing the shutter button will then take the picture.

183
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,640
Framing the subject correctly.

184
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,800
Oh, look at that.

185
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,160
You can make it look so much better.

186
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,200
Your subject needs to fill a good portion of the frame to be

As you can see, the subject of the photo is written on it in
Japanese.

371
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,640
Maybe you have to zoom in.

372
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,690
That's the skin.

373
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,210
No!

374
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,050

00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,430
Auega-can.

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,170

Good thing you'll never need to know that.

388
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,800
I wonder how big this map is

389
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:48,640
Okay, so I'm like I know what it said Okay, it lasts 48
hours Right?

00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:58,080
Natural Natural scent But natural scent that lasts I can't
read it though That's the thing about like kanji that I do

391
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:09,640
like Sometimes it's just like this is This is like the kanji
for Suzuki you know And like the kanji for um but sorry my

392
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:16,880
brain but i can't read them together but then i'm just like

00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,220
Tell me what they wore.

398
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,620

399
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,120
Tell me the color of their eyes.

400
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,900
Tell me what they said, the first thing that they said when
they saw you.

Tell me everything.

402

Have it on her desk by Monday.

405
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,950

00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,580
I have no money.

407
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,820
It's all the filters, though.

408
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,280
Okay, I should be taking more photos.

409
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,260

It lit up.

414
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:24,820

00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,040
Oh, wait.

416
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,080
It's Koraku again.

00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,400
Wait, but what else lit up then?

418
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,100

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,160
I always...

460
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,440
Not always, but...

461
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:24,820
Sometimes I confuse this word, rei zoko, with the word for
candle.

462
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,660
Sometimes I'll instead say candle, which is, I can't
remember right now.

463
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,180
Yes, rōsoku.

464
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,980
Yes, sometimes I confuse the rei zoko.

465
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,260
But I always think of the rei.

466
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,300
part because it's like the cold, you know?

467
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,860
Why candle?

468
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,060
It's similar to me.

469
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
Oh, wow.

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,760
We got a, um, grocery store here.

548
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,980
Oh, sorry, mini-bini.

549
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:02,740
Oh!

550
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,100
The Sakura.

551
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,180
Sakura under this beautiful night.

552
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,580
First Mintsupa ever, because I just got a fat work check.

553
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,000
Ironically, we both learned a bit of Japanese at the same
time.

554
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,120
I just took a year-long class and I just finished.

555
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,700
Passed after struggling, but we got a W.

556
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,620
Let's go, Nuto!

557
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,620
Thank you!

558
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,680
Thank you so much and congratulations on passing!

559
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,600
Let's go!

560
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:34,700
Saku.

561
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,300
What's that one song?

562
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,680
Hana wa Hana wa Hana wa Saku.

563
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,040
Kirei.

564
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,220
Not the Tsuki.

565
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,840
Not the Tsuki is Kirei, but the Hana.

566
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,820
And Hanami!

567
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,120
This is what I wanted to do, Hanami.

568
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,080
The Sakura bloomed right as I was leaving, so I didn't get
to really do Hanami or anything.

569
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,660
the Sakura Matsuri.

570
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,260
Oh no.

571
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:09,280
This is a t-t- a t-t- it's not a titty it's a city.

572
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:16,880
I was gonna say it's a town but I also said it was a city so
I then said it was a titty.

573
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,360
Fujiakishi.

574
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,460
I could read the Aki because that's you know.

575
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,400
Haru Natsu Aki Fuyu.

576
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,440
We see what we want to see as well.

577
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,520
I didn't see anything!

578
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,500
I said it.

579
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,000
Oh, what's your name?

580
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,100
Kawakami Nobuo.

581
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,300
Wow.

582
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,860
Oh, Hanabi Tai Kai, fireworks display.

583
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,080
Oh, this one is written.

584
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,580
Tamura Akiko.

585
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,120
She's like, I'm gonna cry.

586
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,760
I'm gonna punch that guy in the face.

587
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,300
Oh no, their cat is missing.

588
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,360
Minto-chan.

589
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,060
Yes, Minto desu.

590
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,300
Welcome to my bishop.

591
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:12,960
Thank you!

592
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,180
They're looking for their cat.

593
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,620
Neko's a little hat on.

594
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,300
His name is Kitty.

595
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,340
His name is Kitty.

596
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,220
Seibetsu.

597
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,060
I've never seen Os.

598
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,880
And then Nene.

599
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,220
Three months.

600
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,920
No, he's so young.

601
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,260
FBSB, Twitter, Facebook, Chichib, YouTube.

602
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,300
Thanks for the five gifted.

603
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,340
Thank you.

604
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,500
He has a little hat on.

605
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,340
Oh, he's so young.

606
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,040
Oh, I thought that was a manatee for a second.

607
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,480
Oh, wait.

608
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,450
Should I take a picture of this?

609
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,960
Kei-ji-ban.

610
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,420
Kei-ji-ban.

611
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:20,940

The sakurai block.

623
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,660
I guess...

624
00:40:59,660 --> 00:40:59,940
Yeah.

625
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,360

Today I got to use my yearly exclusive birthday soupa.

632
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:14,720
Yippee!

633
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,960
Thank you, Goji!

634
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,300
Are you saying that it's your birthday today?

635
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,060

636
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,300

know, because it's just like, how do I say this in English?

643
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:21,770
Oh wait, but they don't say the English pronunciation, so
maybe it's kind of hard.

644
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:33,550
But you could be like, akarui means bright, or chiker means
turn on, or kesu means turn off, you know?

645
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,130
Labor Day was nine months ago.

646
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:43,470
All they need is an English voice mode.

647
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,590
Yeah, exactly.

648
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:49,110

I use that all the time.

669
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,330

00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:41,610
Oh no, I forgot the name.

676
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:42,430
Something akishi.

677
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:43,870
Oh no, I forgot!

678
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,950
I'm gonna go read it again.

679
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:53,450
Ah!

680
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,630
Oh my gosh, we almost just died just then?

681
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,900
Were you here before?

682
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:05,660

That cunning little cat.

685
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,300
That cunning little cat.

686
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,860
Kaout on a pet.

687
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:23,600
Kawaii!

688
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,060
Kawaii.

689
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:25,580
Oh, whoops.

690
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,520
Let's see what other borders we've got.

691
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,560
Oh, this one's so cute.

692
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,280
Wait, were you here before?

693
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:37,990
Why are you giving me that look for?

694
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:44,010
I like that one too.

695
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:45,090
Okay, I was.

696
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,430

00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:51,350
Fujiaki.

702
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:51,590
Fujiaki.

703
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,950
Thanks for the cat, fake me.

704
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:54,770
Oh wait.

705
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:56,490
If we do this, is it like a tree?

706
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:00,290
Sakura.

707
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:01,630
Oh, this one's also Sakura.

708
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:03,250
Sakura.

709
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:05,490
Can you see me?

710
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,330
Or am I a ghost for real?

711
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:10,570
Am I a ghost for real?

712
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,000
Kagami.

713
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:15,980
Kagami.

714
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,180
I'm a ghost.

715
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,360
Or a vampire, yeah.

716
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,740
If it weren't raining, this would be pretty aesthetic,
wouldn't it?

717
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:26,740
Miru.

718
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,260
Walu.

719
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:27,940
Uh-oh.

720
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,640
Jibun.

721
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:37,550
Yama?

722
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,330
It's not just any, Yama.

723
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,910
It's not just any, Yama.

724
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:47,530
No, Valu.

725
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:56,890
It's not just any.

726
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,830
Can we get there?

727
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,590
The game hates us.

728
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:07,850
Oh, I guess...

729
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:08,750
Okay, run is a toggle.

730
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:10,590
I've been like trying to...

731
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:12,130
Oh, we got the ginkgo ATM.

732
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:17,430
Wow.

733
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:19,170
looks so beautiful.

734
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:20,690
What about this?

735
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:21,690
Is this like a castle?

736
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:23,430
Oh yeah.

737
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:24,010
Oh, yeah.

738
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:26,130
Nice.

739
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,810
I wonder what castle this is based off of.

740
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:38,190
Korai.

741
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:40,290
Ganko.

742
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:41,290
Sightseen.

743
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:42,150
History.

744
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:43,930
Historical.

745
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:46,090
Nice.

746
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:47,070
Oh.

747
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:50,070
Make 25 photo flashcards.

748
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,910
Let's take a picture of our casa.

749
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:53,710
Okay.

750
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,730
People are gonna need this.

751
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:56,870
Kasa!

752
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,330
To get wet.

753
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:03,150
To hold.

754
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:05,250
To forget.

755
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:06,510
Oh my gosh, I forget.

756
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:11,130
I don't know how many times I've forgotten my umbrella in
Japan.

757
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:15,490
Mikasa is too Kasa.

758
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:18,010
Happy basket.

759
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,050
Look at it, a little smiley.

760
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:25,810
Oh, They're looking for people.

761
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:26,630
They're hiring.

762
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,170
Oh, that's Spanish.

763
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:34,810
No, it's not.

764
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,350
I'm pretty sure I just said Japanese.

765
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,150
Let's get this little chow.

766
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:44,810
No, I'm pretty sure I...

767
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:45,090
Oh, wait.

768
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:46,010
I just deleted it.

769
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:51,690
I'm pretty sure Mikasa...

770
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:53,850
It's to Casa.

771
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:56,170
Doko Descalo, Bibliotheca.

772
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:57,290
Yeah.

773
00:47:59,150 --> 00:47:59,570
Uh, Casa.

774
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:00,130
Casa.

775
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,190
Like I said, Casa.

776
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:02,630
Uh, there's not one here.

777
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:06,030
Hey, slow down, buddy.

778
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:11,700
Um.

779
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:12,620
Casa.

780
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:13,300
I said Casa.

781
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,240
Pretty sure that's, uh, that's, um, Japanese.

782
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,220
Oh my gosh.

783
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:25,920
Wait, are those the train stations that they say in, in, uh,
In Metal Gear.

784
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:28,460
Whoa!

785
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,180
Whoa!

786
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,900
You should not just have this out!

787
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,720
Yo, that's...

788
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,320
Oh my god!

789
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,400
Let's go steal somebody's identity.

790
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:37,740
Taisetsu.

791
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,680
I'm stealing this.

792
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:48,880
Agawawa.

793
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,480
Agawa.

794
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:10,060
I must study this further.

795
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:11,660
Hotel.

796
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,240
Tomaru.

797
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:16,800
Yasumu.

798
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:18,620
Takai.

799
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,140
Safety first.

800
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:29,660
Safety first, everybody.

801
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,320
You see this everywhere with construction.

802
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,620
Anzen Daiichi.

803
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,540
Oh my god!

804
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:43,020
If you get more than three pieces of steak, you get 10% off!

805
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,580
10% off three or more steaks!

806
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:48,660
San Mai Ijo.

807
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,000
Cheap mate!

808
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,100
Wait, read the sign.

809
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,800
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

810
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:04,620
I can't read kanji.

811
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:05,840
Look at this cow.

812
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,580
Why can't I read you?

813
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:13,360
Oh my god.

814
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,400
I know it's the parts of the cow.

815
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,180
But like...

816
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:18,620
Tomato.

817
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,300
Show you.

818
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:23,880
Egg.

819
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,510
My favorite.

820
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:29,390
Tamago.

821
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:32,250
I'll show you.

822
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:33,510
Walu.

823
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:34,230
To break.

824
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:36,750
To boil.

825
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:37,770
Marui.

826
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:39,510
They are round.

827
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:42,670
Round little eggies.

828
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:44,990
320 M for 15.

829
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,700
Xer so expensive now.

830
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,720
Well, recently.

831
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:55,840
So expensive.

832
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,360
Okay, you guys want to drink?

833
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,460
You guys want to drink?

834
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,020
What is a Genki Cha?

835
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,820
You could have a super sport.

836
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,120
Suika drink!

837
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:09,900
Suika drink?

838
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,460
No, no, I have the lemon misu, probably.

839
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:14,540
Misu kudasai.

840
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,280

842
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,000
Nomu.

843
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,320
Swayaka.

844
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,260
Sosogu.

845
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,760
Yeah, I'm not pouring it to anyone except my mouth.

846
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,600
Pour where?

847
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,460
Inside my mouth.

848
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,080
spaghetti?

849
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,000
Too delicious.

850
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,140
Do you have no spaghetti?

851
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,780
Anzen daisan?

852
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:56,060
Do they have any niku?

853
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,860
One of the few kanji I actually know.

854
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,360
Niku!

855
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:05,860
Let's see.

856
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:10,800
Oh, wait.

857
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,660
I wonder what it will say.

858
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:37,960
I guess we can't take a picture of that.

859
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:41,460
Oh, it does say I was gonna say or we can't read it either,
but it does say Stop,

860
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:45,800
stop.

861
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:50,560
Oh, let's make an offer and take a picture.

862
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,160
Jinja!

863
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,520
Jinja!

864
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,360
Oh, jiggisiru.

865
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,520
Innoiru.

866
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,360
Oh, yeah, shukyo.

867
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,100
Toro.

868
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,640
Toro.

869
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:16,900
Prophet Daichi.

870
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:17,640
Yeah!

871
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,280
Prophet Daichi!

872
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,080
Akaru.

873
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,560
Takai.

874
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:24,720
Dekishi.

875
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,280
Yeah, I guess it's like very...

876
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,120
You know, very Japanese.

877
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,840
So I guess you would say historical, right?

878
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,380
It's kind of...

879
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,560
Why is it always raining?

880
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,040
Oh my god.

881
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:38,580
Tori.

882
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:43,980
Tori.

883
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:52,480
Yeah, but then, yeah, maybe dendoteki would be like more
better to say than historical, right?

884
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:53,620
Kōrāi.

885
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:54,900
Kuguru.

886
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:02,900
Onion pan.

887
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:13,670
Congari-to caramel-yro ni.

888
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:15,110

00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:18,590
Onion bread.

890
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:21,050
Baked to a golden caramel color.

891
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,080
pan.

892
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,540
Onion pan.

893
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,900
Token pan is super koku.

894
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,840
Oh, no.

895
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,520
Koku-san komugi.

896
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,160
komugi.

897
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,260
I know that one.

898
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,600
100% is used.

899
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:56,160
All of our bread is made from 100% to domestic wheat,
comugi.

900
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,700
I think this whole game is ilastoya, to be honest.

901
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:05,620
Look at her!

902
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,080
My nichi, oishi!

903
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,240
Let's take a picture of her.

904
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:12,680
Panya!

905
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,960
Shumon siru, erabu, yaku.

906
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:18,660
Mmm.

907
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,700
Look at all this.

908
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,560
Anpan is my favorite.

909
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,660
I love, love, love, anpan.

910
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,260
Which is the red bean.

911
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,400
Red bean.

912
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:33,640
bun red bean bread benchio

913
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,020
what's your favorite though

914
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:55,160
tax included actually a lot of a lot of places in Japan do
tax included I feel like most places do or at least they'll

915
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:02,220
show like the price and then they'll show the price with tax
included so you can at least like You don't have to do the

916
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,960
math on your calculator.

917
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,640
You can at least just have the tax.

918
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:11,400
And it's so awesome.

919
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,300
Zaycomi.

920
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,320
So great.

921
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,560
It's so much easier.

922
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,260
Also, it's so inexpensive.

923
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:20,820
Shokopan.

924
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,080
Fluffy milk bread.

925
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,440
Yummy.

926
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:28,940
Three cheese.

927
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,100
Oh, sanshi cheese.

928
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,180
cheese pan.

929
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,360
France pan.

930
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:36,960
France pan.

931
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,720
Meron pan.

932
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,420
Meron pan, meron pan.

933
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,780
Choco corona yummy.

934
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,480
Pita pan.

935
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,760
Oh, it's like a pita bread.

936
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:03,300
oh, oh, I can't read.

937
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:07,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

938
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,620
Oh, I said it.

939
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:12,120
Same.

940
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,300
Oh, Peter Pan!

941
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:22,620
Why would the bread store be selling Peter Pan, you guys?

942
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,480
Why would the bread store, that's kind of messed up.

943
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,840
I like Peter bread, though.

944
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,720
Tough times.

945
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,140
Tough times, nevertheless.

946
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,440
Peter, the horse is here.

947
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,300
Delicious pita bread is loved through the ages.

948
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,780
Why would they write that though?

949
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:49,500
Oh!

950
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,020
Uh, the, the...

951
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:53,480
What?

952
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,640
Children eat for free?

953
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:58,780
Oh my god.

954
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,400
Oh, my god.

955
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:11,380
Oh, wait, do you need to have a, I mean, I'm a child at
home, so like, Mama Maria.

956
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,600
Everybody go to Mama Maria, apparently.

957
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,400
Okosama Ranchi.

958
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,080
Yes, Okosama Ranchi.

959
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,920
But sometimes they have Otona no Okosama Ranchi.

960
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:29,620
Or if you want, so it's like the child's, the children's
menu, right?

961
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:34,200
But sometimes they have a children's menu made for adults.

962
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,820
So that if you're just like...

963
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:38,560
I...

964
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,360
Go me.

965
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,800
I took a picture of you!

966
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:45,940
Um, so that, uh, if you want the stuff on the children's
menu, you can have it.

967
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:46,300
Stere.

968
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,300

00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,880
This is the most annoying thing.

971
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,000
BUNBET SURU.

972
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:02,160

Japan, you have to, like, rinse out all your stuff.

977
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:43,240
And, like, it was so annoying because it's waterproof.

978
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:49,060
So I'm, like, trying to get the water inside the little tube
and then trying to get it to come out.

979
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,580
And it was just so, oh, it was so annoying.

980
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:54,880
It was so awful.

981
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:58,960
Oh, my gosh.

982
00:59:59,020 --> 00:59:59,980
Our picture together.

983
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:00,820
Well, not together.

984
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:04,240
Okay.

985
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:06,620

I'm not dividing.

996
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,160
I'm eating this whole bag myself.

01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:21,450
Ah!

1107
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:23,650
Ah!

1108
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:28,010
Get it because it's Otaku and Kuma.

1109
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:31,970
Kuma is bear and then Otaku- Otaku-Kuma?

1110
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:35,970
Does someone mention the door to darkness?

1111
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:38,650
That's the bear.

1112
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:42,410
Hey, a maid cafe?

1113
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:43,130
Yes!

1114
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:47,650
It's based off of Made Dreamin.

1115
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:49,890
Actually, the sign is pretty close and the logo.

1116
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:55,550
Made Dreamin, Made Melody, You made the country, let's go.

1117
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:01,530
Oh.

1118
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:05,030
Mao, no, no, no, no, no.

1119
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:06,290
Demon King's life.

1120
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:09,070
Access denied, though.

1121
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:10,430
They banned me.

1122
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:12,350
I've been banned from the Made Cafe.

1123
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:14,990
I've been banned

1124
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:22,980
Wait, guitar girls

1125
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:36,720
Wait, two-year-old Wait, two-year-old Hatsubai-chu
Hatsubai-chu It's another one you hear all the time On sale

1126
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,120
now Have you guys ever heard of guitar girls?

1127
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:48,500
It's probably like Lifetime ban No No, no, they wouldn't
ever.

1128
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:53,560
I mean, they kicked me out by my butt and said, if we ever
see you again here, we're calling the cops.

1129
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,900
But I don't think that I mean that for a lifetime.

1130
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,180
I don't think they mean that for that long.

1131
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:01,820
Probably until like next week, you know?

1132
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,880
They kicked me to the curb right on my poor, poor bottom.

1133
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:11,060
And they said, you better not step another foot inside this
establishment or we're calling the cops.

1134
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,460
But I don't think they meant that for life.

1135
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:19,840
If they meant it for life, they should have said, In our
whole life!

1136
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,700
But also, I'm dead.

1137
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:26,160
So, um, that's kind of discriminatory to me.

1138
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,700
I don't, my afterlife never ends.

1139
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:31,760
They're just being soon?

1140
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:33,220
Yeah, I hope so.

1141
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,440
Fusen!

1142
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:36,740
Fukuramas.

1143
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,280
Walu.

1144
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:40,980
Pan.

1145
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,080
Pan.

1146
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:43,920
Pan.

1147
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:45,080
Oh, no.

1148
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:45,720
Oh, no.

1149
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:46,180
Oh, no.

1150
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,640
Why is it making the space?

1151
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:48,580
Oh, no.

1152
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,740
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1153
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:57,540
Wait, can we go down here?

1154
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,460
Fujiaki Den-Tets.

1155
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:07,400
Fujiaki Electric Railway.

1156
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,760
Sakurai Eki.

1157
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:13,920
Sakurai Eki.

1158
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:14,620
Oh, my gosh.

1159
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,220
I want to go see a Shizen-N-Modoru.

1160
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:18,420
Is he gonna...

1161
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:18,880
Wait a second.

1162
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:20,320
Why is the chef...

1163
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,980
Why is the chef around all these edible animals?

1164
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,280
Also, what a movie to release.

1165
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:27,420
Okay, is this a romance?

1166
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,420
It's being released on Valentine's Day.

1167
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:32,680
Wait.

1168
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:36,140
Wait.

1169
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:45,270
What is he intending to do with them?

1170
01:09:48,190 --> 01:09:51,310
Return to nature, like return them to nature, or...

1171
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:54,190
Whoa!

1172
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:57,510

1173
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:57,950
Get it!

1174
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:01,210
Looks like that plane had some panties on.

1175
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:03,570
Wait.

1176
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:05,210
Where did it go?

1177
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:07,450
Huh?

1178
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:09,470
Ghost plane?

1179
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:11,270
Where did it go?

1180
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:12,310
Oh!

1181
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:14,570

From my time in Japan, when I went to high school, I have a

1188
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,880
thousand paper cranes that my classmates created for me.

1189
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:35,780
And I've kept it all this time.

1190
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,100
And guess what has holes in it now?

1191
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,340
Because she can't stop biting it.

1192
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:43,980
She's like, all the time.

1193
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:49,400
And then there's also a box that I have filled with letters
that were sent to me.

1194
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,520
And she keeps trying to knock it over.

1195
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,880
There's too many letters that I don't know what to do.

1196
01:11:54,900 --> 01:12:00,340
do with them yet i might have to get like a really really
really big scrapbook or something but i don't know what to

1197
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:09,100
do with it yet and she keeps trying to knock over the box
she's such a menace and so she'll go from the box to the

1198
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:16,780
cranes back to the box to the cranes and then she'll try and
chew on every cord that i have which you know by my computer

1199
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:19,460
i have quite a few so she's just such

1200
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,400
Why did your classmates make a thousand cranes for you?

1201
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:30,660
Oh, because I was leaving.

1202
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:37,220
I was going home, and so they were like, Minto time, we had
so much fun with you here.

1203
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,380
We'll miss you so much.

1204
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:41,740
Yeah, I was leaving.

1205
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:43,500
So sad.

1206
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:49,940
Yeah.

1207
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:52,640
Not because you died.

1208
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,800
Why would they make that for me because I died?

1209
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,040
Where are the leaves?

1210
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:57,580
Oh.

1211
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:01,800
It looks like it's on his head!

1212
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,040
Frui.

1213
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:04,980
Rekishi.

1214
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:08,680
History.

1215
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:11,900
Historical history.

1216
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:17,380
When you...

1217
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:20,200
Basically, the thousand cranes is like you make a wish.

1218
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,560
So...

1219
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,380
Murphy, thanks.

1220
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:24,020
Crazy.

1221
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:25,620
It's like people like you or something.

1222
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:27,260
That'd be it.

1223
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:27,580
Why?

1224
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:28,820
Huh?

1225
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:29,880
No.

1226
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:31,520
Why?

1227
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,560
What is the top one so we can tell Matara?

1228
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:38,680
Furui.

1229
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:41,840
Furui.

1230
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:46,940
I think, I feel like Nekishiteki would be like a sick
insult, you know?

1231
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:52,360
Instead of like, instead of calling someone just old, you
call them historical.

1232
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:55,860
You're just like, damn girl, you're not just old.

1233
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,620
Like you are historical.

1234
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:00,820
Like, whoa, Nekishiteki.

1235
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,360
It's like ancient, but like...

1236
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:09,220
It's like a sophisticated insult.

1237
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,940
Knowing her though, she'd take it as a compliment.

1238
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,260
Can I take a picture of the rock?

1239
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:18,860
Iwa?

1240
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,400
Iwa!

1241
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:23,200
Wait, what's the difference between Iwa and Ishii?

1242
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,560
Are Ishii smaller?

1243
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:26,420
Ooki!

1244
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:27,420
Omori!

1245
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:28,500

01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:46,240

I knew you'd like it, I knew you'd like it.

1250
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,880
I knew you guys would like it.

1251
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:17,940
I knew you guys would like it.

1252
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:19,740
What about this thing?

1253
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,240
It's just here.

1254
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:24,740
I should be able to take a picture of everything.

1255
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:30,600
Oh, the cat.

1256
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:32,980
No, this is a different cat.

1257
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:34,320
Oh.

1258
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:37,580
Litter, litter, litter.

1259
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:40,500
Oh, just...

1260
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:40,880
Nomimono.

1261
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:42,680
Why don't you call it Mizu?

1262
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,240
You're right, your mom is...

1263
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:49,000
See?

1264
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:52,420
It's a pretty sophisticated joke, is it not?

1265
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:55,000
It's a pretty...

1266
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,060
It's a pretty, pretty sophisticated joke, is it not?

1267
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:00,850
Oh, hats, coats, accessories...

1268
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:02,140
Apparel?

1269
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:03,900
Accessory?

1270
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:04,740
Coato?

1271
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:05,660
I love this.

1272
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:08,040
borrowed word except Boshi.

1273
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:12,300
Which...

1274
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:12,960
Is that?

1275
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:19,720
Is that a Chinese, like, taken word, I wonder?

1276
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,700
If anybody knows.

1277
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:28,980
But it's so funny, everything else is a borrowed word.

1278
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:30,700
Boshi the Rock.

1279
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:36,110
Wait, why can't I read it?

1280
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:38,470
No, why can't I read it?

1283
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:22,060
so one thing that i like had to learn um or rather you i
guess you learn kind of quickly is um is when you say so you

1284
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:27,160
say like you know when you're at this when you're at a
restaurant you you get something on your mouth or whatever

1285
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:35,220
you use a napkin but in japanese napkin has a totally
different meaning napkin napkin don't go to a restaurant

1286
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:37,420
well You could.

1287
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,140
You could go to a restaurant and ask for an apokin.

1288
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:44,740
But, um...

1289
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,000
But, uh...

1290
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,940
You might, um...

1291
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,260
What does it mean, though?

1292
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:55,300
It means...

1293
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,320
Um...

1294
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:59,340
It means a sanitary pad.

1295
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:02,680
The things that, um...

1296
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:06,020
You know, when you're on your...

1297
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:21,960
period so if you go to a restaurant and say hey can i get a
pad with my meal people might be like um oh we have a

1298
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,280
freaking unless you're at wait

1299
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:38,730
did did that did that podcast episode go up about um the
jail.

1300
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:40,730
I think it did though, right?

1301
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:42,710
Oh wait, no, it wasn't the podcast.

1302
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:43,790
It was, uh, with Giddy.

1303
01:18:44,830 --> 01:18:46,230
The collab with Giddy.

1304
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:47,390
The collab with Giddy.

1305
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:51,770
Where, um, I went to a prison-themed restaurant.

1306
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:56,110
And, um, in what restaurant would that possibly be normal?

1307
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:57,710
Exactly what I'm saying!

1308
01:18:58,330 --> 01:19:09,650
There was, there was, there was a jail-themed restaurant,
and they would serve like, um, they would serve like a

1309
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:20,490
strawberry jam type stuff on a on a on a on a sanitary
napkin it wasn't menstruation themed cafe they just had i

1310
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:29,730

Kyoku part, the Kyoku part is, um, kind of means like a type

1313
01:19:54,170 --> 01:20:00,170
of, how do you say, like a building, not a bit, like a, how
would you say?

1314
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:06,430
If the Okiakusama asks for a napkin, the Okiakusama shall
have a napkin.

1315
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:09,250
That's the Japanese service I expect.

1316
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:11,190

They keep the steamy stuff inside.

1492
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:10,010
I once stayed at a hotel that was across the street from
a...

1493
01:31:10,810 --> 01:31:24,690
I guess a publishing company, but they published like a ton
of like, um, uh, the, it was like, not Shonen Jump, but one

1494
01:31:24,690 --> 01:31:33,350

the more, the more, oh, la la, uh, mangas and stuff like

1495

1496
01:31:34,410 --> 01:31:36,490
And so they just had them out on display.

1497
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:37,550
I wonder if I have a picture.

1498
01:31:38,110 --> 01:31:38,930
Hold on, I'm gonna look.

1499
01:31:41,290 --> 01:31:52,410

01:36:57,950 --> 01:37:08,310
Japan loves cabbage and I don't mind cooked cabbage but like
raw cabbage is so it's they'll just have a pile of raw

1580
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:23,970

bitter not a big fan not a big fan mmm cabbage I like it

1581
01:37:23,970 --> 01:37:29,710

1582
01:37:31,450 --> 01:37:33,670
I prefer raw to cook cabbage.

1583
01:37:36,030 --> 01:37:36,470

01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:20,780
I can't even read it.

1600
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:25,500
I can't even...

1601
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,240
What is a curry retort?

1602
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:28,820
Rettort curry.

1603
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:34,980
Oh, I can't read it.

1604
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:36,120
Oh, my gosh.

1605
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:37,520
It's so hard to read.

1606
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:41,480
I can't even read it.

1607
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:44,060
Oh, no, pets.

1608
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:45,100
Pet-pick-pins.

1609
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,360
Oh, my gosh.

1610
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:58,260
Kine-n-kine-kine.

1611
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:00,880
Oh, sorry.

1612
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:01,840
Satsuhi-kinesi.

1613
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:17,040
So you can't wear your helmet inside.

1614
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:19,740
It's kind of weird request, right?

1615
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:22,920
Whoa!

1616
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:28,920
Oh, chusen is like evil word, right?

1617
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:29,600

1618
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:33,080
Chusen de Hachiman Mesa.

1619
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:38,060
Do a lot of people still smoke in Japan?

1620
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:39,460
Yeah, they do.

1621
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:40,840
I think so.

1622
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:43,580
They do.

1623
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,280
What's the difference between Kenyan and Kienchi?

1624
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:49,720
Kenyan is specifically for smoking.

1625
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:56,180
And Kienchi is just like for like not allowing you to do
something else.

1626
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:59,940

No.

1644
01:40:46,580 --> 01:40:48,740
They don't want to take me to take a picture of the sign.

1645
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:50,140
What else have I gotten?

1646
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:56,060

No, I like it when I say moiru because it's kind of like
moe.

1649
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:05,680
Sometimes, like, I've seen places.

1650
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:14,200
I suppose I think it's specifically like I've seen them in
Akiba, but like they'll kind of make a joke about like Moe,

Sad.

1670
01:42:45,170 --> 01:42:48,990
We'll do it in black and white because it's depressing that
there's none.

1671
01:42:50,370 --> 01:42:51,610

1696
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:10,240
Teuchi Udon.

1697
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:11,980
Shinosuke.

1698
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:13,540
Handmade in noodles.

1699
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:14,440
Shinosuke.

1700
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:19,900
Whoa.

1701
01:44:21,060 --> 01:44:22,300
Wait, are these like the samples?

1702
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:23,760
Are they gonna say...

1703
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:24,820
Oh, they do say tabemono.

1704
01:44:25,380 --> 01:44:26,420
But this isn't a tabemono.

1705
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:31,760
So actually, one thing that's really fun, I don't know if
you, I did it through school.

1706
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:35,880
So I don't know how easy it would be for foreigners to book
an appointment.

1707
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:41,900
But you know how like in Japanese restaurants, they'll have
the sample foods that like exactly like this there.

1708
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:47,300
They sit outside and show you what kind of stuff that they,
the ultra realistic plastic models.

1709
01:44:47,460 --> 01:44:48,240
Exactly, exactly.

1710
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:51,880
I went to, I went to a factory.

1711
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:55,760
I don't know if you call it a factory, but I went to the
place that makes them.

1712
01:44:56,420 --> 01:45:05,840

think anybody can go to open to the public and buy um some

1713
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:12,800
kits that you can make your own um but also i think it's i
think it would be really fun if you ever go to japan and

1714
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:19,480
you're wanting something to do that's kind of unique they do
have like workshops where you can create your own and then

1715
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:28,240

then you get to take it home too so uh it's really cool it's

1716

really fun and they have they i wonder let me see if i can

01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,560
Is that some place in Ikebukuro?

1720
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:58,180
I don't remember where I went to.

1721
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:01,680
Maybe this is it.

1722
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:03,380
Hmm.

1723
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,200
But yeah, I guess you can book it.

1724
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:09,260
And then they also have the gift shop.

1725
01:46:09,380 --> 01:46:12,900
So if you're just like, oh, we made this thing, but I want
to make this at home.

01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:34,100
It's my Osusume.

1732
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:37,220
Remember we said Osusume?

01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:39,380
What is this?

1734
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:41,700

01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:08,440
Soft cream.

1742
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:10,380

Very informal way of saying you.

1786
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:14,640
And sounds very rude.

1787
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:17,060

01:51:57,210 --> 01:51:58,450
Doggo can't do math.

1819
01:51:58,590 --> 01:51:59,830
No, Doggo need... Wait, who?

1820
01:52:00,490 --> 01:52:00,690
Okay.

I'm sorry.

1822
01:52:02,210 --> 01:52:04,010
Who spent...

1823
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:04,550

1824
01:52:06,910 --> 01:52:08,270
How much would that be now?

1825
01:52:11,210 --> 01:52:12,550
How much would that be now?

1826
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:16,690
$130?

1827
01:52:18,390 --> 01:52:19,990
Uh, $110?

1828
01:52:21,450 --> 01:52:26,330
Well, who spent over $100 on snacks?

1829
01:52:27,570 --> 01:52:28,890
I would too though.

1830
01:52:29,130 --> 01:52:29,970
He's a good boy.

1831
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:31,830
He's such a good boy.

1832
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:35,130

They do.

1835
01:52:37,830 --> 01:52:38,130
Sorry.

1836
01:52:42,210 --> 01:52:43,150
What was I doing though?

1837
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:47,690
I was doing something and then I got distracted.

1838
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:54,490
Was I still looking at the samples?

1839
01:52:55,410 --> 01:52:56,490
No, I closed out of that.

1840
01:52:59,970 --> 01:53:01,390
I don't remember what I was doing.

1841
01:53:05,670 --> 01:53:07,710
Sani was atashi, so I wasn't the dog girl.

1842
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:10,530
Oh, you're probably right.

1843
01:53:14,190 --> 01:53:14,830
Oh, someone's...

1844
01:53:14,830 --> 01:53:15,530
Oh, yes, that's right.

1845
01:53:15,590 --> 01:53:16,470
We were going through here.

1846
01:53:16,590 --> 01:53:17,530
I was like...

1847
01:53:18,550 --> 01:53:19,830
Thank you.

1848
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:35,490
Yuki-chan is to become a VTuber.

1849
01:53:35,710 --> 01:53:36,550
She's so cute.

1852
01:53:46,670 --> 01:53:48,170
Oh, I don't want to be my son.

1853
01:53:49,470 --> 01:53:49,650
Oh.

1854
01:53:55,310 --> 01:53:55,790
Wow.

Introduction.

1857
01:53:58,850 --> 01:53:58,930

Oh, my God.

1863
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:23,160
Sorry, the voices are so low.

1864
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:26,600
Let's turn it up just a little bit.

1865
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:31,960
There we go.

1866
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:37,000
Wait, is that a voice changer?

1867
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:39,320
Wait, is that a voice changer?

What is that?

1883
01:55:31,130 --> 01:55:31,610
Why?

1884
01:55:31,810 --> 01:55:32,610
Why is it so scary?

1885
01:55:32,890 --> 01:55:36,710
Why the Yuki-chan is cute, but the Mito is cute!

1886
01:55:45,150 --> 01:55:46,270
Eh, it's great!

1887

I don't think he was saying that about the curry.

1921
01:58:08,350 --> 01:58:16,430
That sounded more like, Yes, I like that sounded like a
confession to me, right?

1922
01:58:17,010 --> 01:58:19,770
I think he likes Haina.

1923
01:58:20,890 --> 01:58:21,770
I think he likes Haina.

1924
01:58:21,770 --> 01:58:24,370

Oh my god, I'm gonna be listening to this just like when I
feel a little bit lonely.

1933
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:49,870

01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:38,400
Ooh.

1941

Rival!

1946
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:51,180
Wait, oh no, that's the Tain-san.

1947
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:53,500
That's the Tain-san.

1948
01:59:58,800 --> 01:59:59,160
Hi.

1949
02:00:00,300 --> 02:00:03,900
We can't see the rival.

1950
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:04,720
There he is.

1951
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:07,000
There he is, there he is.

1952
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:09,420
What, is my head too big or something?

1953
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:20,220
Oh, oh, oh my gosh, this is so, oh my gosh, this is actually
so helpful.

1954
02:00:22,040 --> 02:00:24,600
Wow, oh, and then it stops there.

1955
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:26,740
Hmm, but that's a lot.

1956
02:00:29,420 --> 02:00:34,980
That's a lot of stuff that they, that they include in this.

1957
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:38,080
I'm actually so impressed.

1958
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:46,940

Capture a butterfly.

1962
02:00:56,340 --> 02:00:57,820

1963
02:00:58,120 --> 02:00:58,980

Okuru.

1968
02:01:14,330 --> 02:01:18,690
Gotta answer the point card question with Dajjobu desu, so
you skip the next question.

1969
02:01:19,490 --> 02:01:23,610
Wait, if they say, do you have a point card, you can't say
Dajjobu desu.

1970
02:01:25,630 --> 02:01:32,090
Just say, oh, what the, are you saying like, oh, they're
gonna ask you if you wanna make one, right?

1971
02:01:38,210 --> 02:01:39,170
Dajjobu desu.

1972
02:01:43,350 --> 02:01:44,890
Why are you spying on other people's mail?

1973
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:48,210
Because I'm a snoop.

1974
02:01:49,490 --> 02:01:50,610
I gotta get all these pictures.

1975
02:01:52,810 --> 02:01:54,330
I have all these pictures to take.

1976
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:00,680
Though I answer Daijoba this to probably 99% of stuff.

1977
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:07,240
Oh my god.

1978
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:08,860

How expensive it is though!

1986
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:20,820
Oh my gosh.

1987
02:02:21,580 --> 02:02:23,380
It's so dang expensive.

1988
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:33,720
You guys, I ate a whole bag of carrots recently.

1989
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:37,480
I ate all of them in one day.

1990
02:02:38,900 --> 02:02:39,900
I love carrots.

1991
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:42,720
Yes, I eat.

1992
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:47,400
I ate them all because they're They're healthy.

1993
02:02:49,320 --> 02:02:50,400
Can you see in the dark now?

1994
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:53,880

1999
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:08,200

02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:14,060
That's a nice radish.

2002
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:24,720
I love a mikan too.

2003
02:03:28,660 --> 02:03:29,460

02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:46,220
Only sometimes.

2010
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:48,020
What about the chocolate chips?

2011
02:03:49,060 --> 02:03:52,180
Oh, I'll get this one too.

2012
02:03:59,320 --> 02:04:09,760

2026
02:05:08,850 --> 02:05:09,550

Oh, my God.

2034
02:05:17,130 --> 02:05:17,630
Mint is Japanese.

2035
02:05:17,970 --> 02:05:19,030
But is she ego-jouzu?

2036
02:05:19,430 --> 02:05:20,370
I'm nothing-jouzu.

2037
02:05:21,570 --> 02:05:22,850
I'm nothing-jouzu.

2038
02:05:23,270 --> 02:05:23,370
I'm nothing-jouzu.

2039
02:05:24,970 --> 02:05:26,510
Nothing Jozu at all.

2040
02:05:26,910 --> 02:05:28,130
Nothing Jozu about it.

2041
02:05:29,890 --> 02:05:33,190
Wait, actually, can I get a picture of the Ajisai in the
rain?

2042
02:05:33,970 --> 02:05:34,410
Oh my gosh.

2043
02:05:34,650 --> 02:05:35,390
Wait, no!

2044
02:05:38,990 --> 02:05:40,730
Why did I have to turn dark?

2045
02:05:48,210 --> 02:05:51,070
Wait, oh, I want a picture of the train, too.

2046
02:05:52,090 --> 02:05:53,550
I guess we'll wait for it to come back.

2047
02:05:55,750 --> 02:05:56,590
Sorry, everybody.

2048
02:05:56,790 --> 02:05:57,870
I gotta get my shot.

2049
02:05:59,830 --> 02:06:00,670
Sorry, everybody.

2050
02:06:00,790 --> 02:06:02,130
I gotta get my shot.

2051
02:06:02,870 --> 02:06:04,190
I want the moon in it also.

2052
02:06:05,770 --> 02:06:07,790
I gotta get my shot.

2053
02:06:14,410 --> 02:06:14,850
Pachinko!

2054
02:06:19,670 --> 02:06:20,110
Sora!

2055
02:06:20,310 --> 02:06:20,510

Oh!

2060
02:06:24,430 --> 02:06:25,190
It doesn't pause!

2061
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:29,220
Oh!

2062
02:06:32,490 --> 02:06:32,930
Dencha.

2063
02:06:33,110 --> 02:06:34,210
What a terrible photo.

2064
02:06:38,930 --> 02:06:39,530
What the?

2065
02:06:40,010 --> 02:06:40,230
Oh!

2066
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,540
Yeah, we got the pachinko in the background.

2067
02:06:51,960 --> 02:06:51,960
Nice.

2068
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:54,460
Nice, nice, nice.

2069
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:55,520
Was that lighting?

2070
02:06:55,940 --> 02:06:57,720
I don't know what that was, to be honest.

2071
02:06:58,360 --> 02:06:58,500
N 'olu.

2072
02:06:59,300 --> 02:06:59,620
Oril.

2073
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:01,960
Hayaai.

2074
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:07,340
Pachinko.

2075
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:11,100
Oh.

2076
02:07:12,980 --> 02:07:13,560
Dang.

2077
02:07:13,740 --> 02:07:15,140
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2078
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:29,460
Hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi
Toei, tobu, yoko, ni-i-kou.

2079
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:31,680
Mm-hmm.

2080
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:34,580
Remember the rule of thirds.

2081
02:07:36,620 --> 02:07:38,280
Didn't it highlight the sky let you know?

2082
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:40,520
Oh, I've already taken a picture of the sky, though, see?

2083
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:42,980
You can see it kind of- it's hard to tell.

2084
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:44,960
I can't show my mouse on it, but it says Sora.

2085
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:46,740
It says so...

2086
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:47,760
Uh-oh.

2087
02:07:48,060 --> 02:07:49,600
We're causing a...

2088
02:07:49,600 --> 02:07:51,260
We're causing a pile up here.

2089
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:52,640
Sorry, everybody.

2090
02:07:52,760 --> 02:07:53,200
Go ahead.

2091
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:55,840
I'm not sorry.

2092
02:07:56,700 --> 02:07:57,600
I'm not sorry.

2093
02:08:00,220 --> 02:08:00,540
Right?

2094
02:08:00,780 --> 02:08:02,220
We're not sorry at all.

2095
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:08,260
We're ready to cause chaos in this little town.

2096
02:08:10,140 --> 02:08:11,320
Can we go downstairs?

2097
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:13,240
No.

2098
02:08:14,180 --> 02:08:14,800
Oh, yes.

2099
02:08:14,820 --> 02:08:15,220
This is where the...

2100
02:08:15,240 --> 02:08:21,960
the their meal is free for the kids.

2101
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:24,160
Okosama menu.

2102
02:08:29,830 --> 02:08:31,690
Do you guys feel really Nihonko Jozu now?

2103
02:08:32,410 --> 02:08:34,370
Do you guys feel like you've learned so much?

2104
02:08:34,950 --> 02:08:36,330
I think I might actually call it here.

2105
02:08:36,450 --> 02:08:40,170
I know it's like super duper, super duper short stream.

2106
02:08:41,650 --> 02:08:43,530
But my throat is hurting quite a bit.

2107
02:08:45,070 --> 02:08:46,470
So sure do.

2108
02:08:47,950 --> 02:08:49,150
Wait, hold on.

2109
02:08:49,370 --> 02:08:52,470
Let's get the perfect photo of Fuji-san first.

2110
02:08:52,910 --> 02:08:53,470
Excuse me!

2111
02:08:54,050 --> 02:08:55,410
You are hindering my photo.

2112
02:09:04,450 --> 02:09:07,930
Let it be a little bit lighter.

2113
02:09:09,830 --> 02:09:11,230
See, it's kind of twilight.

2114
02:09:12,630 --> 02:09:13,150
Fuji-san.

2115
02:09:13,890 --> 02:09:15,570
Japanese go slightly more jiu-jitsu.

2116
02:09:18,850 --> 02:09:19,570
Fujisan.

2117
02:09:24,210 --> 02:09:25,830
Nihonko peko peko desu.

2118
02:09:27,850 --> 02:09:29,210
Hanzen daichi...

2119
02:09:29,210 --> 02:09:30,070
Hanzen daisan!

2120
02:09:32,750 --> 02:09:33,090
Hello?

2121
02:09:33,330 --> 02:09:34,930
Is it gonna...

2122
02:09:35,810 --> 02:09:36,670
become daytime?

2123
02:09:41,030 --> 02:09:41,370
Yama?

2124
02:09:41,930 --> 02:09:42,330
Yama.

2125
02:09:42,470 --> 02:09:43,930
Oh yeah, see before it was raining.

2126
02:09:49,950 --> 02:09:50,450
Fuji Yama!

2127
02:09:50,570 --> 02:09:51,270
Dekai Yama!

2128
02:09:51,930 --> 02:09:53,150

2129
02:09:54,230 --> 02:09:54,490

2133
02:10:07,350 --> 02:10:08,550
I'm sorry!

2134
02:10:08,550 --> 02:10:11,810
What is the second?

2135
02:10:12,730 --> 02:10:14,970
The second is...

2136
02:10:20,530 --> 02:10:23,070
The second is Moe.

2137
02:10:23,570 --> 02:10:26,430
It's so big, Fuji-san.

2138
02:10:27,950 --> 02:10:28,670
Yama!

2139
02:10:31,790 --> 02:10:33,850
Yeah, baby!

2140
02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:36,710
We got the ultimate photo.

2141
02:10:40,870 --> 02:10:41,050
Yama?

2142
02:10:41,750 --> 02:10:42,730
No, let me see it.

2143
02:10:42,810 --> 02:10:43,110
Yama?

2144
02:10:43,850 --> 02:10:44,790

Japanese

2166
02:12:47,810 --> 02:12:58,570
they need an N2 version of the game yeah yeah it's a yeah
just like having

2167
02:13:03,490 --> 02:13:11,210
everything I don't know even what N2 would be like though it
would be so intensive right it would it would be like every

2168
02:13:12,210 --> 02:13:22,890
individual thing right but it looks like almost that they
want to add more maps you know because I mean they have

2169
02:13:22,890 --> 02:13:28,870
these area oh wait can you get the fish Oh Oh Oh

2170
02:13:38,030 --> 02:13:43,190
It's kind of a bad picture but that's okay pretty much hence
the invisible wall mmm

2171
02:13:46,490 --> 02:13:47,830
I think so too.

2172
02:13:48,510 --> 02:13:49,970

Wait, is this the cat from over here?

2177
02:14:02,930 --> 02:14:03,190
No!

2178
02:14:03,690 --> 02:14:05,150
There's just cats everywhere.

2179
02:14:13,430 --> 02:14:14,970
No focus on the cat.

2180
02:14:17,470 --> 02:14:22,790
Wait, I don't, I wish I could lift it up a little bit more.

2181
02:14:23,650 --> 02:14:26,470
But it goes out of, there we go.

2182
02:14:27,230 --> 02:14:29,590

Okay, once more Sakura fell, fall and then we'll be.

02:14:37,670 --> 02:14:38,390
Nyan-chan.

2186
02:14:39,350 --> 02:14:40,350
What's the cat doing?

2187
02:14:41,490 --> 02:14:44,950
He is, he's, um, he's...

2188
02:14:44,970 --> 02:14:47,790
I'm contemplating as life choices.

2189
02:14:48,010 --> 02:14:48,890
Don't do it, Cat.

2190
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:51,230
Don't do it, Cat!

2191
02:14:54,690 --> 02:14:55,790

2193
02:15:00,450 --> 02:15:02,790

Wait.

2197
02:15:08,590 --> 02:15:11,710
Oh, it's not letting me take a picture because I'm not
focused on something.

2198
02:15:11,970 --> 02:15:12,210
Wait.

2199
02:15:13,450 --> 02:15:14,010

2200
02:15:14,970 --> 02:15:16,030

2201
02:15:16,030 --> 02:15:16,410
Kawa.

2202
02:15:17,030 --> 02:15:18,470

2207
02:15:29,330 --> 02:15:30,550
Is this a bridge actually?

2208
02:15:30,690 --> 02:15:31,070
I can't tell.

2209
02:15:31,950 --> 02:15:32,610
I guess not.

2210
02:15:33,930 --> 02:15:37,490
I was hoping it would let me take a picture of the bridge,
but...

2211
02:15:39,070 --> 02:15:39,590
Okay.

2212
02:15:41,030 --> 02:15:43,510

There is like DLC for this game, but it's only for filters.

So hopefully they add more maps and I don't think I'll
stream it again, obviously.

Because, you know, it's just...

2230
02:17:55,970 --> 02:18:02,590
It seems more like a good way to study on your own and have
an interactive way to study if you're more of that kind of
