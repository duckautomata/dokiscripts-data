00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,780
Welcome back!

2
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,300
Master!

3
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,520
Princess!

4
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,370
I'm back!

5
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,190
Hello!

6
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:05,570
Hello!

7
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:06,530
Hello!

8
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:06,850
Hello!

9
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,750
Hello!

10
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:08,510
Hello!

11
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:10,870
Hello!

12
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,490
Hello!

13
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,230
Hello!

14
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,110
Hello!

15
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,170
Welcome back to Devil May Cry!

16
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,310
I'm gonna do my best to finish the game today!

17
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,190
I'm gonna do my best.

18
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,690
We're on chapter 15?

19
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,030
I think.

20
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,390
I think.

21
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,950
I thought this was gonna be DMC3.

22
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:45,410
No!

23
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,830
DMC1 part 3.

24
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,590
Yeah.

25
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,790
VTuber, you are back!

26
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,630
I'm back, baby!

27
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,230
SirSimplot, thanks for 6 months!

28
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,290
Did you know there's an unused laser cannon found in the game's demo?

29
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,330
Laser cannon!

30
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,370
Holy moly.

31
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,490
Oh my gosh.

32
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,590
I learned something about this game, actually.

33
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,710
I learned something about this game.

34
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,810
Oh my gosh.

35
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,710
I learned something about this game.

36
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:28,510
I learned that this game was technically supposed to be Resident Evil 3!

37
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,490
Oh my god.

38
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,170
Technically.

39
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,790
Techni...actual...legalities.

40
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:37,850
Three!

41
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,830
You guys have been saying four!

42
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,130
Three!

43
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,210
But that's actually, like, apparently the case.

44
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,590
Like, it was... Oh gosh.

45
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,030
Hold on.

46
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,710
I have to remember what I read.

47
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:59,670
It was like, Resident Evil... Yeah, Code Veronica was supposed to be Resident Evil 3.

48
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,150
And then this was based off of that or something.

49
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,850
It was like a whole process that happened.

50
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:15,690
And then just some things happened and it was like passed down generations.

51
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,750
It was some weird thing.

52
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,850
Why are you lying?

53
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,550
I'm not!

54
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,250
I'm not!

55
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,330
I think it was like a bunch of mixed up stuff.

56
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:33,330
Dozed off over the end of the stream last night, but congrats on unlocking the second most epic bro handshake in video game history.

57
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,430
Thank you!

58
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,070
She's right.

59
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:37,390
See!

60
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,310
I read that!

61
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,130
The internet wouldn't lie to me.

62
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:47,830
Actually, the whole project leading up to Resident Evil 4 spawned three different franchises.

63
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,370
That's crazy, right?

64
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,110
I've been watching these streams like a ho...

65
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,170
I won't say that word anymore.

66
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,670
Like a bird, to a certain extent.

67
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,830
I won't say that word anymore.

68
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,450
You can't get me with Mike.

69
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,710
You can't get me with Bird.

70
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,130
You can't get me!

71
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,710
You can't get me!

72
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,890
Bionic Hippo, welcome back!

73
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:19,750
Hello, hello!

74
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,050
Hikari, welcome back!

75
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:21,510
Hello, hello!

76
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,430
Lambris, welcome back!

77
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,890
Hello, hello, hello!

78
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,330
I don't want to waste too much time talking.

79
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,070
Especially because I got to get used to the controls again.

80
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,170
Exotic Milkshake, thank you!

81
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,130
For two months!

82
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,640
Do you prefer Chris Redfield or Leon Kennedy?

83
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,160
I only know more about Leon, in all.

84
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,120
I don't know so much about Chris.

85
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,780
Birdy, welcome back!

86
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,660
Peach, welcome back!

87
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,760
Saku, thanks for the pick!

88
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,100
Just happened to catch you in between meetings, still dealing with big, big work.

89
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,140
It's been a lot, but seeing you be so cute and unabashedly yourself on Twitter...

90
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,580
What am I doing on Twitter?

91
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,040
Thank you, Saku!

92
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:14,980
Okay.

93
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,300
Chris punched a rock once.

94
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,500
That's some big news.

95
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,300
Everybody should know that.

96
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,220
Spread it.

97
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,300
Spread it online.

98
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,300
Alright.

99
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,540
We cleared mission 14.

100
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,980
Go to the surface and head for the Colosseum.

101
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,220
Oh, we're about to go to the... Oh, we're still doing the Colosseum.

102
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,580
Oh, Wheel of Destiny, use a shield and a pair of lances to conquer the Colosseum.

103
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,120
Oh, no!

104
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,660
Oh, the Colosseum!

105
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,780
Oh, gosh, the Colosseum!

106
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,980
Oh, no!

107
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,760
Oh, gosh.

108
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,320
Hold on.

109
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,120
What do I have?

110
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,120
I have...

111
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,680
My big head is blocking it.

112
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,860
Where should I sit?

113
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,100
I don't wanna, like... Okay, maybe right here in the tippy corner.

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,220
Maybe here in the corner.

115
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,220
Let's see.

116
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,720
I have 1200 rorbs.

117
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,260
I've been using... We used it for a little bit.

118
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,380
I use Alistair a lot.

119
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,580
This is the Colosseum mission?

120
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,540
Oh, no!

121
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,440
I gotta get good real fast.

122
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,060
Oh, thank you, Nun!

123
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,020
Good luck on buying Ace Combat Visual Lightstick.

124
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,540
Don't make sure you don't buy horror version.

125
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:40,900
Okay.

126
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,840
Thrustmaster is better.

127
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,340
Okay.

128
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,000
I will make sure.

129
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,020
Ifrit is for real gamers?

130
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,280
Stop it.

131
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,120
They're both right.

132
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,600
I have... I accidentally leveled up one of them.

133
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,580
Before.

134
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,740
I don't have enough rorbs for Inferno.

135
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,280
Let's see.

136
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,660
Stinger?

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,480
Can't even do a new Stinger.

138
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,420
Level up anyway.

139
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,960
What do I... Maybe I should get, like, a new purple...

140
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,920
A porb.

141
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,080
Maybe I should get a porb.

142
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,600
I don't know.

143
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,000
You know what?

144
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,680
Let's just go in.

145
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,840
I gotta figure out...

146
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,020
I gotta figure out how to play the game again anyway.

147
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,720
Okay.

148
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,980
Oh gosh, I'm nervous.

149
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,800
Who's fighting?

150
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,680
I mean, who's there?

151
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,360
Oh, I have a grenade.

152
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,340
Oh my gosh.

153
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,540
Oh god.

154
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,320
Wait, I'm not ready!

155
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,640
Oh god!

156
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,360
Oh god!

157
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,360
Shoot, how do I fight again?

158
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,180
Oh my god.

159
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,580
Wait.

160
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,140
How do I... Oh, there we go.

161
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:55,680
Wait.

162
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,880
How do I fight again?

163
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,940
Oh shoot, guys.

164
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,680
This is not good.

165
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,760
Here's where I learn how to fight!

166
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,120
Oh, there we go.

167
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,520
Oh my god.

168
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,460
Yeah!

169
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,340
What are you talking about?

170
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,160
That was so cool!

171
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,410
Stingers!

172
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,690
Stingers!

173
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,670
Stingers!

174
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:25,850
Absolute!

175
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,950
Where are you going, buddy?

176
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:29,930
Where are you going?

177
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,620
Oh my god.

178
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,340
I got good at the game again.

179
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,960
Are there more?

180
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:50,820
No.

181
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,220
Oh, I missed.

182
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,260
It would have been way cooler if I hadn't missed.

183
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,360
Dodge!

184
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,140
Oh gosh!

185
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,180
Oh, I'm gonna die here, you guys.

186
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,500
I think... I think I'm gonna die here.

187
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,840
Oh, I can devil trigger.

188
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,680
That's right.

189
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,100
I heal when I devil trigger.

190
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,620
Oh, this guy is dead.

191
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,440
Okay, hold on.

192
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,360
Come here.

193
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,200
Why are you in the corner?

194
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:56,870
Oh my gosh.

195
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:57,530
Oh my gosh.

196
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,140
Yeah!

197
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,640
Kill him Dante!

198
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,360
Yeah!

199
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,280
Oh my god.

200
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:13,980
There is more?

201
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,000
Even still?

202
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,260
Do these guys never stop coming?

203
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,520
I won't let you even...

204
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,800
Oh, we did it.

205
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,940
Let's go.

206
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,860
Oh my gosh.

207
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,640
Get my rorbs.

208
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,540
Gather my rorbs and my thoughts and my feelings.

209
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,340
Oh!

210
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,760
I love watching my Oshie spam a single move and kill demons.

211
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,940
I did spam it really good though.

212
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,940
Yippee!

213
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,750
And my health is...

214
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:56,920
Oh, I know Halloween is almost over, but Crow Country is a really good old-school RE-inspired game.

215
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:03,360
I actually had Crow Country initially on the list of games I wanted to play.

216
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,160
Potentially.

217
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
We came from here.

218
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,640
During Halloween.

219
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,340
But I'm not going to lie.

220
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,240
Games like Resident Evil aren't really my favorite types of games.

221
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,240
I don't know.

222
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,060
It's just not so...

223
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,760
I don't know.

224
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,000
More?

225
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,880
Oh my god.

226
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,620
Where?

227
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:21,660
Where?

228
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,280
I think I dilly-dally too much.

229
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,680
Are you dead?

230
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,700
Okay.

231
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,680
So I don't know.

232
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,800
I thought about it.

233
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,880
Maybe in the future.

234
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:45,930
What was this?

235
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,630
How do I... Oh, there we go.

236
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,830
There's a decoration resembling two knights.

237
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,610
It appears as though the knights should be holding something.

238
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,290
Words are carved beneath the decoration.

239
00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:00,910
The shields that glow with light and a pair of lances shall lead to the battleground.

240
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,190
This is the shield.

241
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,000
Shall I use the emblem shield?

242
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,960
Sure.

243
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,420
I'm scared, you guys.

244
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,620
Gecko, thanks for six months.

245
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,280
Oh, shit.

246
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,400
Die!

247
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,000
Die!

248
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,040
Die!

249
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,520
God, leave me alone!

250
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,400
What is this?

251
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,880
Who else is here?

252
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,500
No one?

253
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,580
I got a luminite.

254
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,720
A mysterious stone that shines in the dark.

255
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,860
An ordinary stone that exists in the underworld that somehow over time gained different properties in the human world.

256
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,120
Where are you?

257
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,700
Yeah, baby!

258
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,610
Guys, we're all good.

259
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,530
Don't worry about it.

260
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,390
This looks like a crack in the wall.

261
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,690
Oh my gosh!

262
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,210
I might be a genius!

263
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,890
I might be a genius!

264
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,270
She's gaming.

265
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:22,710
Yeah.

266
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,850
I'm also getting rich, baby.

267
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,050
A Yorb!

268
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,570
Let's go!

269
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,010
Nothing else.

270
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:36,250
OK.

271
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,590
Yorb!

272
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,110
Yorb!

273
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:39,490
Yorb!

274
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:39,870
Yorb!

275
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,230
Where is this light coming from?

276
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:46,010
Dante is just God's favorite child, maybe.

277
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,370
We can power up here.

278
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,150
Oh, the luminite.

279
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,810
It's the light of the party.

280
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,810
Air raid?

281
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,930
Become airborne and be capable of performing aerial electrocution attacks.

282
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,910
Yeah, I did get air hike.

283
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,910
So air raid would be good, maybe because of...

284
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,530
how I fight.

285
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,910
I like to jump in the air and...

286
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,350
and do a little something or other, you know?

287
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,130
Get air raid?

288
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:37,450
OK!

289
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,130
Let's try it out.

290
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,670
You know I still have enough for a Yorb.

291
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,030
Why not?

292
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:42,770
I'll get both.

293
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,690
But I'll be poor.

294
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:45,870
Boo.

295
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,210
Oh my gosh!

296
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:47,910
Ghost!

297
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,750
Welcome to the membership, thank you.

298
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,710
Air raid gives you...

299
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,490
invisibility?

300
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,450
You mean invincibility?

301
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:57,610
Get the Yorb!

302
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,270
I'm poor.

303
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,390
I'm Yorb!

304
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,050
Oh, wait.

305
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,070
There was a... Oh, this is the door I go through down here.

306
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,790
But I'm... Is there anything here?

307
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:17,570
OK, I'm good.

308
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:18,150
No, alright.

309
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,090
Let's go downwards.

310
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,470
I forgot that I came from up the upstairs.

311
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,270
I thought this is where I came from for a second.

312
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,050
Oh, no.

313
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,070
No, not this shit again.

314
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,590
Oh, man.

315
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,710
Come on.

316
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,910
Give me a break.

317
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,020
OK.

318
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,220
3, 2, 1, go.

319
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,200
What the hell is this?

320
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,100
Wait, what is this?

321
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,740
Come on Dante!

322
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,180
Dante!

323
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:00,600
Get it!

324
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,040
Get it!

325
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,260
Dante!

326
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,660
What did I do?

327
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,100
I opened... a thing?

328
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:07,940
OK, hold on.

329
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:09,960
And go.

330
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:11,980
OK.

331
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,320
Oh my gosh.

332
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,260
Oh my gosh.

333
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,400
I'm not going to be able to...

334
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,520
Oh god.

335
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,000
Dante.

336
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,820
Dante.

337
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,360
Dante, keep going.

338
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:20,920
Keep going, buddy.

339
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:21,880
Keep going, buddy.

340
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,740
Keep going.

341
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,220
OK, I unlocked something else.

342
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,280
Alright, alright, alright.

343
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,560
What's here?

344
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,560
A little break.

345
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,300
Oh, what's this?

346
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,580
Do I want to go in here?

347
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,960
What is this?

348
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,380
This is the posing room.

349
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,080
Wow, Dante, you look so cool.

350
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,560
Yeah.

351
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,160
Wow, Dante.

352
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,300
Yeah, everybody?

353
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,920
Screenshot time.

354
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,920
The upskirt room.

355
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,500
What is this?

356
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,600
Oh, words are inscribed.

357
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,940
Sacrifices become magical powers and rise to the connecting passage.

358
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,800
To the skywalk.

359
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,600
Sacrifices become magical powers.

360
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:14,900
OK.

361
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,060
These are a lot of sacrifices already.

362
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,120
Can I break them?

363
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,760
Yeah, so ominous, right?

364
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,560
It's not me, right?

365
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,980
I'm not the sacrifice.

366
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,220
Probably.

367
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,220
I should not fall.

368
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,780
Oh golly.

369
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,340
I see the guys down there.

370
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,660
What is this?

371
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,640
Nothing?

372
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,080
OK.

373
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,200
It's morbid time.

374
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,960
Mii, thank you for the support.

375
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,900
The Colosseum entrusts the conqueror with the lance.

376
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,580
The time has come to open the door.

377
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,140
A pair of lances.

378
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,100
To be held by the knights who guard the gate.

379
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,260
You cannot equip this item.

380
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,840
Yeah, I know.

381
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,640
That's kind of messed up, game.

382
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,700
That's kind of messed up, game.

383
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,940
This is what John and Father Garcia aspired to be in the future?

384
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,400
Probably.

385
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,900
Wait, where am I supp...

386
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,140
I can't see what I'm doing though.

387
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,500
I just jump into the darkness?

388
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,920
How do I use the air raid?

389
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,800
How do I do that?

390
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,590
Ouchie, ouchie.

391
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,650
Sting or jump?

392
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,430
Wait, so...

393
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,330
Wait.

394
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,110
Wait, I gotta get my orbs first.

395
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,520
Devil trigger only mid-air.

396
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,140
OK, OK.

397
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,320
Devil trigger only.

398
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,140
Got it.

399
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,870
I'm wallhacking.

400
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,090
Oh, we're back here.

401
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,960
Oh gosh.

402
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,680
I couldn't see it.

403
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,680
Oh god, OK.

404
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,500
I'm still not sure what this is about, but OK.

405
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,040
I can practice with the refill.

406
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,460
Oh, this is...OK.

407
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,480
What the hell?

408
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,860
Is this it?

409
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,120
Wait, what the hell was that?

410
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,170
That's air raid.

411
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,230
Oh my gosh, OK.

412
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,510
You become a bird?

413
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,010
Now shoot when you fly.

414
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,690
You shoot lightning.

415
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,250
OK, hold on.

416
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,830
Let's try it again.

417
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,010
Oh, wait.

418
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,670
Wait, I'm trying to...

419
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,210
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

420
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,850
Ah, I see, I see.

421
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,150
OK, it's the gun button.

422
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,490
OK, it's not sword button.

423
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,830
I understand now.

424
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,290
Lightning is like a gun.

425
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,850
Run, run, run.

426
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,410
Oh my god, oh my god.

427
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,790
This game is so evil.

428
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,280
Who else is around?

429
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,120
Upstairs, I think.

430
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,980
Where is the upstairs?

431
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,560
Where did I come from?

432
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:32,820
Hello?

433
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,420
Oh, up here.

434
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:33,920
There it is.

435
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,300
I hear him.

436
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,180
Cause we gotta go do the swords, right?

437
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,220
Give me your money!

438
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,460
Give me your roars!

439
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,400
Recommend you checking out the anime before you start 5.

440
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,140
Well, that's not till a long time from now, so...

441
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,600
Remind me then.

442
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,870
Oh no!

443
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,910
Oh my gosh.

444
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,050
I'm gonna double trigger.

445
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:05,950
I can't see anything.

446
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,160
I think that worked.

447
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,280
Oh, I think that worked.

448
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,540
Are they still around?

449
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,360
Why is there so much laughing?

450
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,980
I think...

451
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,240
I still hear something.

452
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:38,960
What the hell is that?

453
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,160
Is that inside the Colosseum?

454
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,370
Sleeping dog?

455
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,290
The swords go here.

456
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,430
Right?

457
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,070
Yeah.

458
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,270
The shields that glow with light...

459
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,910
Paralances, yes.

460
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,870
Oh no!

461
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,230
Thank you so much!

462
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:08,970
Oh gosh.

463
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,010
Thank you!

464
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,250
I can't see it, but thank you so much!

465
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:22,290
Oh my gosh.

466
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,790
We're inside the Colosseum!

467
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,670
Oh my gosh.

468
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:30,790
What is happening in here?

469
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:37,650
Okay.

470
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,530
I'm just observing a little bit.

471
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,190
Right now.

472
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,450
Ducky, thanks for the gift.

473
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,190
Look at what happens with these portals.

474
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,430
That looks like a leggy.

475
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,670
I'm scared, you guys!

476
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,170
I'm scared!

477
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:08,830
I'm scared!

478
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,170
Run for cover!

479
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:10,970
Thanks for the five gifted!

480
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,070
That looks like another leggy.

481
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,210
Oh no, that's... nevermind.

482
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,810
That's just all broken up.

483
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,570
I don't know if I go into this or the warps.

484
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,350
Hold on, let me see what these do.

485
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,150
Do they hurt me?

486
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,240
Okay, that's what I thought they did.

487
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:37,520
Okay, save that for...

488
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,820
when we need it.

489
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,000
A Yorb?

490
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,160
I will take it.

491
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,600
A Yorb, Yorb, Yorb!

492
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,980
Any more...

493
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,520
Gorb?

494
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:55,880
Yes.

495
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,620
Any more...

496
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,700
other treasures?

497
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,460
Any other Yorbs?

498
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,220
Did they give me more than one Yorb?

499
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,020
Okay, the fact that they gave me a Yorb at all makes me...

500
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,000
really nervous.

501
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,320
They are like, we know this is hard.

502
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,740
You need this Yorb.

503
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,760
Where is the Morb?

504
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,000
Bottom right.

505
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,680
Okay, alright.

506
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:42,390
I hear someone speaking to me inside my mind.

507
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,470
Offer a sacrifice to the Colosseum.

508
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:51,310
It shall connect the path to the Wheel of Destiny.

509
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,840
Oh my gosh, wait.

510
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,170
Oh my gosh, wait, it's this guy again.

511
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,090
Oh my god, wait.

512
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,370
It's this hecking guy again.

513
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:25,410
Oh my god.

514
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,310
Oh, screw this guy.

515
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,730
Why can't I double trigger?

516
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,450
Oh, that saved me actually.

517
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,730
No, no, no!

518
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,210
Oh, I misread it.

519
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,510
Oh my god, I can't see.

520
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,230
I can't fight either.

521
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:01,990
No, wait.

522
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,830
Wait, why can't I turn into a bird?

523
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,810
Okay, I turned into a bird just to...

524
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,270
Oh gosh, I can't see anything.

525
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,890
Please, please game.

526
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,610
Please game, be kind to me.

527
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,310
Game, I can't see anything!

528
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,800
I think I'm not attacking him.

529
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,100
Where is he?

530
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,720
Let's go!

531
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,200
Wait, but he wasn't... He was like halfway health.

532
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,440
Okay, phase two.

533
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,600
Oh my god.

534
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,880
Oh my god, no way.

535
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,060
Spam, Dr. Spam!

536
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,500
Ouchie, ouch.

537
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,220
Am I supposed to... Oh my god.

538
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,120
Am I supposed to avoid that?

539
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,340
Oh, I went right into it.

540
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,000
Go, go!

541
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,900
Double trigger!

542
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:49,910
Yeah, bitch!

543
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,710
Yes, bitch!

544
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,510
Yes, bitch!

545
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,560
It's okay, I think.

546
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,040
Yeah!

547
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,590
Oh!

548
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,870
Where is he?

549
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,430
Where is he?

550
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,650
I love Air Raid.

551
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,550
Sacrifice.

552
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,190
For the wheel of destiny.

553
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,550
Mundus!

554
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:46,450
Yeah!

555
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,490
Mundus!

556
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,350
No, no, no.

557
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,650
No, please.

558
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,010
Please no.

559
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,690
Yeah, block off Feather Face!

560
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,130
No.

561
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,280
No!

562
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:44,820
It really sounded funny that, like, Torzia and Griffin sounded like just a guy with a voice changer.

563
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,760
The three-eyed.

564
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,640
The High Lady, you're here.

565
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:54,780
Not mom.

566
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,500
Yeah, it was.

567
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,480
Mundus.

568
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,860
Nuh-uh.

569
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,800
Oh my god.

570
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:26,480
In the name of the Mundus.

571
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:26,920
Ow!

572
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,240
Kill Mundus!

573
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,300
Mundus!

574
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,800
Why did she leave?

575
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,260
Sailor Dante.

576
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,960
Oh, let's go grab the...

577
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,620
Wait, what's my health looking like?

578
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,260
Yeah, let's go grab the...

579
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,680
These don't work anymore?

580
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,400
Are you kidding me?

581
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,240
Oh, come on!

582
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,520
But I want the Grorb.

583
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,540
I can't get the Grorb anymore!

584
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,880
Their raid is too powerful.

585
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,260
Glad we talked about it in the last stream.

586
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:09,100
I know what you're saying is sad, but I can't hear you over the piano.

587
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,720
Okay, maybe here I can dump, because I couldn't see before in the other...

588
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,220
No!

589
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,140
Dante.

590
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,140
Alright, stand there.

591
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,540
There we go.

592
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,000
Okay, we made it.

593
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,360
Thank you, thank you.

594
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,400
Easy peasy, that's my gamer Oshi.

595
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,620
Colosseum conquered, baby.

596
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,620
Maybe we can just fall into it from here.

597
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:38,540
Dramatic!

598
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,960
I overestimated a little bit.

599
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,240
What is this thing anyway?

600
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,300
Hello?

601
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,220
Oh, come on!

602
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,700
Dante, stand on top of it.

603
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:56,400
Dante!

604
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,550
Dante!

605
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,550
Ah,

606
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:16,690
finally!

607
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,190
Harder than the bird.

608
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,350
What's this?

609
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,650
Can I jump on top of this thing?

610
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,650
Oh, no, that's where the platform landed.

611
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:34,890
What's this?

612
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,870
At least we still have the Orb of Confusion.

613
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,730
What's that?

614
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,350
There's something written.

615
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:46,910
The King of Avalon shall turn the Wheel of Destiny and take the story to the Beginning Land.

616
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,630
Wheel of Destiny?

617
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,470
Oh my gosh, we just have the Wheel of Destiny!

618
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,850
A round plate resembling a Destiny's repetitive cycle.

619
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:59,130
I just have all this stuff.

620
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,890
Yeah, we did it!

621
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:06,930
What did I get?

622
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,390
A B!

623
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:14,030
Not bad, for forgetting the controls a little bit.

624
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:18,690
Save.

625
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:22,450
Nice.

626
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,490
Alright, next mission, baby!

627
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:31,310
Mission 16, Nightmare of Darkness.

628
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,970
Unravel the mystery of the Staff of Hermes.

629
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,650
Shall we power up?

630
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,450
Oh my gosh, I love Air Raid.

631
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,270
Thank you guys for telling me to get it.

632
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:46,270
I don't think we would have been able to beat Big Ol' Bird Brain over there without it.

633
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,030
Vortex up with them enemies.

634
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,140
There's also Ifrit.

635
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,080
I can't get any more Orbs.

636
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,960
Or even Blue Orbs.

637
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,840
Can I get some Yorbs?

638
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,060
Vortex's Air Raid Stinger.

639
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,240
No way!

640
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,640
Save for Orbs.

641
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,120
Inferno is great for ground control.

642
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,020
Inferno.

643
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,080
Oh, I need a lot of money for that though.

644
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,200
Create a wildfire and burn everything with it.

645
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,680
Oh, I see.

646
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,320
These are for when I pull my Devil Trigger.

647
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,980
And these are for normal.

648
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,580
Okay.

649
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,300
For now, let's just continue onward.

650
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,240
Mission started!

651
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,120
Oh my gosh!

652
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,160
We got a Blorb!

653
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,960
They just gave it to us.

654
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,440
Wait, what was the Blorb for?

655
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,340
Oh, the Blorb is when you collect more Blorb.

656
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,860
You...

657
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,060
You...

658
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,800
Increase your health.

659
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,120
I remember.

660
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,550
More life, yeah.

661
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:31,730
I remember now.

662
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,210
So what do I do with this wheel?

663
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,460
Unravel the mystery of the staff...

664
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,580
Where is that?

665
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,860
Oh, oops.

666
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,080
Back to the courtyard?

667
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:45,500
Okay.

668
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,560
The door is right there.

669
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,500
Wow, I thought the Colosseum would be way more dramatic.

670
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,080
Oh shoot.

671
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,180
Oh my god.

672
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,260
Screw it.

673
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,660
Yay, air raid!

674
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,260
Is it here?

675
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,060
Where they are guarding me over to?

676
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,420
I don't remember what's in here.

677
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:34,940
Okay, hold on.

678
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,900
It's very spoopy in here, it is.

679
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,460
The staff... Okay, so we went in there.

680
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,960
I've been in there.

681
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,320
I think I gotta go where the...

682
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,840
These are...

683
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,880
Calling for me.

684
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,960
The cows.

685
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,300
I hear pigs.

686
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,100
I hear the whole farm up in this tower.

687
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,220
Where the hell am I?

688
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,040
Wait a second, this is where I fought...

689
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,620
Oh no, nevermind.

690
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,560
Wait a second, maybe I went to the wrong place.

691
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:19,720
Oh,

692
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,250
it is the right place.

693
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,130
Okay, sorry.

694
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,610
It's a little confusing.

695
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,280
What's this?

696
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,780
Devil star!

697
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,740
Nice, take it.

698
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,280
What's this?

699
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,240
There is a message carved in the circle.

700
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,100
The wheel of destiny shall guide you to the land of the beginning.

701
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,580
It's about to get more confusing.

702
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,500
Okay, I might require some assistance, everybody.

703
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,480
We'll see how brained I can be today.

704
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,080
I didn't get much sleep.

705
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,800
Oh my gosh, in my head, all I was doing was playing...

706
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,660
Like, while I was trying to sleep...

707
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,520
My brain was so active.

708
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,840
I just kept playing Faith.

709
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,240
Like, in my brain.

710
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,580
I was making up levels of Faith, since I played Faith.

711
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,540
Last night...

712
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:41,400
And so I was just like, okay, now I gotta go fight this boss, so I can get this ending.

713
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,080
And I was like, oh my... I could not get it out of my brain.

714
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,020
It was so annoying.

715
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,360
And I'd be like, okay, focus on the audiobook I put on.

716
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,640
Which I put on something about mummies.

717
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,640
It was like a documentary on mummies.

718
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,840
And I could not focus on it at all.

719
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,820
I don't know anything about the mummies.

720
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,160
Someone is snoring in my ear.

721
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,400
Okay.

722
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,700
Oh, that's my own shadow.

723
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,820
Where are we anyway?

724
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,880
The door has disappeared.

725
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,280
It must be the work of dark evil powers.

726
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,980
Is there a door here?

727
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,520
There is a door there?

728
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,900
Are we at the...

729
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,580
Oh yeah, we are at the main entrance room.

730
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,760
Wow, can I still get the orb that was up there?

731
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,720
That I missed all that time ago?

732
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,860
Oh, I saw a blorb.

733
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,360
Oh, wait, it's over this way.

734
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,740
What's the music?

735
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,740
Why is it like that?

736
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:07,850
Blorb fragment.

737
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:13,650
Oh, we made a whole blorb.

738
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:15,170
Lucky us.

739
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,370
Okay, awesome.

740
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:17,950
Why is it so spooky?

741
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:21,190
Am I supposed to... I feel like I'm supposed to just run.

742
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,350
What did I do?

743
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:39,890
What did I just...

744
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:42,330
Uh-oh.

745
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:45,990
I created a bat.

746
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:49,270
It's my child now.

747
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,790
I met Eredor.

748
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,510
Yeah, that's so awesome.

749
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,520
Oh, double trigger?

750
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,720
Oh, I can't double trigger.

751
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,700
Hey, you can't use my own stuff on me.

752
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,480
No, no, stop it.

753
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:13,980
Stop it!

754
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:14,840
Stop!

755
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:15,740
Stop!

756
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,640
I think I did it.

757
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,920
The stinger stung lock.

758
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:27,820
A classic.

759
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,400
Wait, what door was that?

760
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,480
Oh, I hear things.

761
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:38,560
I hear things.

762
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,120
Okay, that's the red one.

763
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,640
This one?

764
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,260
Blue one.

765
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,860
Oh, come on, again?

766
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,060
Oh my god, there's...

767
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:11,510
Wait, I double triggered though.

768
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:12,830
Oh my god, what is happening?

769
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:18,330
I'm not hearing very much right now, you guys.

770
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,350
That was pretty bad.

771
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:23,630
Wait, what the hell?

772
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:27,550
Oh my god!

773
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,170
They don't stop coming.

774
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:19,510
They don't stop coming.

775
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:23,250
Oh my god, please.

776
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:39,660
Ridiculous.

777
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,220
That's a lot of rorbs.

778
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,260
Yeah!

779
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,420
We got so many rorbs.

780
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,300
Good, go us.

781
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,160
Now we have two doors.

782
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:52,940
Oh, just kidding.

783
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,000
There used to be a door here.

784
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,600
Wait, is there still anything up here?

785
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,540
Doesn't seem to be the case.

786
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,720
Oh my gosh, it's so spooky in here now.

787
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,480
Go in through here?

788
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,320
Oh, it was kind of a door.

789
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,420
It was a thing.

790
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:18,660
Oh my god.

791
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,280
It was a thing that I had to attack.

792
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,820
It was like a little elevator.

793
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:26,620
I remember.

794
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:27,560
Oh gosh.

795
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,980
Wait, where the hell am I supposed to go?

796
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,840
I don't remember where the thing of Hermes was.

797
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:43,020
I remember this was a little library room.

798
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,160
It still exists.

799
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,080
Is there anything in here?

800
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,140
Besides the power-up?

801
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,020
It's not.

802
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,360
More rorbs.

803
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,000
Why do you attack the elevator?

804
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,060
You just gotta.

805
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,880
You have to attack the thing to open up the elevator.

806
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,220
I remember.

807
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:18,020
We're halfway there to getting Inferno.

808
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,080
Alright.

809
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,060
Yeah, I remember.

810
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,540
My memory is not going that much.

811
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,060
Is this level 2?

812
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,160
Wait, should we actually?

813
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,040
Don't let him get a little word in.

814
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,600
Don't even let them get a word in.

815
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,420
Oh my gosh.

816
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,020
There was a door.

817
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,720
Wait, all these doors are disappearing.

818
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,280
But the painting of the middle-aged man stays.

819
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,720
Yeah, I think I have... I think I can't upgrade my stinger anymore.

820
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:03,940
Oh my god.

821
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:04,800
Party.

822
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,940
Oh wait, I can kill him.

823
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:07,800
Hold on.

824
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,180
Unless the door was further down here.

825
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,240
No, there was a door.

826
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,700
Trippy place.

827
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,440
This game looks fun.

828
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,780
It's very fun actually.

829
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,480
There was the door here!

830
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,820
Oh my gosh, everything has changed.

831
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,080
This is where I fought the spider.

832
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,160
Wait, what's that?

833
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:50,070
Hold on, let's look around first before we activate anything.

834
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:52,470
This is pretty.

835
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:55,330
This is... wet?

836
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:57,510
Oh god, what?

837
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:58,530
What do you mean, oh god?

838
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:02,510
What do you mean?

839
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:04,110
Be careful?

840
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:05,870
Of the wet?

841
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:06,990
Of the water?

842
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:14,490
Nightmares?

843
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:16,530
You're scaring me.

844
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:17,790
If I touch it, what happens?

845
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,990
Wait, what's...

846
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,490
The door won't budge an inch!

847
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:22,710
Okay.

848
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:25,630
I'm just exploring real quick.

849
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:27,850
What's about to happen?

850
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:28,850
I don't even know.

851
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:29,470
I'm scared.

852
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:30,590
You guys are freaking me out.

853
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:34,950
You guys are freaking me out!

854
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,610
I guess I start attacking this.

855
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:47,610
Oh, it lit up?

856
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:48,990
Okay.

857
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:53,990
Oh, they all light up.

858
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:55,070
I think.

859
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:56,930
Wait, what?

860
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,940
Hit it with the sword?

861
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,320
Check the puddle.

862
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,300
Save?

863
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,040
Oh gosh, you guys are scaring me.

864
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:18,460
Wait, how many?

865
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,520
I have two yorbs.

866
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,160
How do I save again?

867
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:24,460
Oh, here.

868
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:27,200
I'm going to save.

869
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,890
It won't let me jump on it.

870
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,580
Do I need to be doing this?

871
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:56,160
Oh, woah.

872
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:00,740
There's a strong surge of evil coming from the puddle of water.

873
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,120
There's a voice in my head saying something.

874
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:09,140
One who knocks on the gate to the underworld shall borrow the strength from the blue stout.

875
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,020
The blorb?

876
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:11,460
Oh boy.

877
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:48,290
Oh

878
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:02,110
my god, what's happening?

879
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:03,390
I

880
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,340
can get grorbs here though.

881
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,300
Those

882
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,880
are a big deal.

883
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,060
I can't see.

884
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,800
Where's the other skelly men?

885
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,640
Oh, there's the big skelly.

886
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:06,910
Oh, there he is!

887
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:09,590
Wait, what the hell?

888
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,470
Oh my god, no, this is actually how it is.

889
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:12,350
Oh shoot!

890
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:13,630
Oh my god, no, no way.

891
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:29,820
This sucks!

892
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,860
I don't want to fight this guy again!

893
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:32,840
Oh my gosh, please.

894
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:34,800
Please!

895
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,140
Dante, run!

896
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,080
Dante, run!

897
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,640
I got him.

898
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:46,880
Again!

899
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,860
Wait, am I going to fight the griffon too?

900
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,640
What is this?

901
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:53,920
Oh wait, can I leave?

902
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,360
Oh!

903
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:10,490
Do I have to get sent to hell?

904
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,230
Oh my god.

905
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:16,730
Oh shoot.

906
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:19,070
Wait, get out of there Dante.

907
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:20,350
Is it?

908
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:20,970
Ok, hold on.

909
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:23,910
Oh my god.

910
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:25,570
Please leave me alone!

911
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,760
Ouchie, ouchie, ouchie, ouchie.

912
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,420
Oh my god, ouchie, ouchie, ouchie, ouchie.

913
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,820
This thing is killing me bad.

914
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:01,570
Oh my gosh!

915
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:02,330
Please!

916
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:03,930
Oh my god, please let me move!

917
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:05,870
Oh my god, no way.

918
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,170
This is so bad.

919
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,810
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die.

920
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:15,050
Get me back to hell please!

921
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:22,830
Oh shoot.

922
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:24,510
And it heals!

923
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:26,350
Or did it heal?

924
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:27,130
Oh my god.

925
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:29,270
This stupid ass thing.

926
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:30,790
Oh my god, this is so bad.

927
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:33,070
This is so... Oh my god.

928
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,360
Green star where?

929
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,100
I don't know where.

930
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,500
It was so hard.

931
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:08,340
NT.

932
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:09,960
Oh my gosh.

933
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,160
Wait, so...

934
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,460
Is the strat to go to hell?

935
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,740
And then... or is it...

936
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,980
I feel like I did the most damage when he ate me up and then I got sent to hell.

937
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,810
One of the hardest bosses in this game.

938
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,980
The hell is slower.

939
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:37,460
Okay.

940
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,260
It did a big damage though.

941
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,400
It did big damage when I went the first time.

942
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,640
It only works once?

943
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,180
I see, I see.

944
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:55,760
It's

945
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:03,890
own DT once it absorbs enough.

946
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:05,830
How do I stop it from absorbing it?

947
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:27,010
Well, it was.

948
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:29,350
It was when I turned it.

949
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:35,190
Yeah, I noticed that.

950
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:39,630
It was just sometimes it was hard for me to aim.

951
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:01,390
If red, you think it would be better?

952
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,480
At least the save spot is close.

953
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,300
Until we run out of yorbs.

954
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,440
Until we run out of yorbs.

955
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:27,380
RB.

956
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:27,820
Why?

957
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:28,380
Okay.

958
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:36,800
You saved in here.

959
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,420
It's fine.

960
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,760
No, that's the thing.

961
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,600
If I run out of yorbs, I have to do the chapter all over again.

962
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,140
It doesn't matter where I saved.

963
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,140
It doesn't matter.

964
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:49,920
You guys, the yorbs are your saves basically.

965
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:55,860
For those who don't know how it works, we only have two yellow orbs and I just ran out of one.

966
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,680
Yeah, this game is absolutely evil.

967
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:03,260
If red on the orb, okay.

968
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,300
Okay, let's try it.

969
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,840
Wait, why isn't it letting me switch?

970
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:14,760
Oh, here we go.

971
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:18,760
Yes.

972
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:38,170
I'm just seeing right now for what's happening.

973
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:44,970
It doesn't last very long.

974
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:46,510
Oh, it's still going.

975
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:48,270
Yeah, okay.

976
01:00:56,930 --> 01:00:57,810
Hold on.

977
01:00:57,850 --> 01:00:58,650
Give me one second, guys.

978
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:01,250
Okay, hold on.

979
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:23,900
Hold on.

980
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,600
Sorry, I got a message I got to reply to.

981
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:56,390
We're good.

982
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:57,750
All good.

983
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:05,620
Alright, here we go.

984
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:12,260
Can I skip this?

985
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,500
These guys suck so bad.

986
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:21,640
Oh my god, please.

987
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:22,880
No.

988
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:23,380
Ouch.

989
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,720
Oh my

990
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:29,300
god.

991
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:32,220
I think we're going to the underworld.

992
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,000
Okay.

993
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:38,560
Why

994
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,240
are they suddenly so difficult?

995
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:01,580
Hi!

996
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:12,910
Where is my grorb?

997
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:14,510
You cheap!

998
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:16,690
Where is my grorb?

999
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:23,570
Hello?

1000
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:25,550
There we go.

1001
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:26,990
Oh my gosh.

1002
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:27,370
Oh my god.

1003
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:32,190
Where is my grorb?

1004
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:33,690
You promised me!

1005
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:36,910
I got no grorb.

1006
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:38,190
This is messed up.

1007
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:40,470
Oh my god.

1008
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:42,490
Please leave me alone.

1009
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:58,200
Punch!

1010
01:03:58,420 --> 01:03:58,720
Punch!

1011
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,560
Just non-stop punch!

1012
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:03,340
Punch!

1013
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:04,860
Punch!

1014
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:06,660
Punch and kick!

1015
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,120
Punch!

1016
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:08,700
Oh my god.

1017
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:10,020
Ouchie, ouch.

1018
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:10,620
Oh my god.

1019
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:12,240
Guys, this is not looking so good.

1020
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,700
Guys, I'm losing so much.

1021
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:15,940
Oh, DT, thank you.

1022
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:29,040
I lost so much health.

1023
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,160
Where is my double jump?

1024
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,480
Why is it not allowing me to anymore?

1025
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,600
Wait, why actually is it not allowing me to double jump anymore?

1026
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:01,820
That's weird.

1027
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:03,760
I

1028
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:53,400
don't think I'm good at using it for it, you guys.

1029
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,380
I don't think I'm good at using it for it.

1030
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:00,520
I don't think... I think I haven't used it enough to where it's like...

1031
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:02,460
Comfortable for me.

1032
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:10,340
Oh, double jump is for Alistair only?

1033
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:15,020
That's why.

1034
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:15,800
Oh my god.

1035
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:20,240
Okay.

1036
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,700
You have to buy it with him too.

1037
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,780
That's crazy.

1038
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,020
Guys, it really helps with me.

1039
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,800
Get it away from me, you suckers!

1040
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:42,080
We're going to hell!

1041
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,660
I don't like it.

1042
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,040
I don't like it.

1043
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:47,880
I don't like...

1044
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:53,400
I don't

1045
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,800
like it.

1046
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,000
That

1047
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,180
last time...

1048
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:09,120
Wait, we're not on the spider yet.

1049
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,500
Where are you?

1050
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:33,840
Where are you?

1051
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:03,290
Just one more hit!

1052
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:03,870
Come here!

1053
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:17,840
We got so many rorbs, guys.

1054
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:23,320
I wonder if I can save even though I don't have any yorbs left.

1055
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,200
Just so I can keep my number of rorbs and all.

1056
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,600
What's my health at?

1057
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,020
Alright, here we go.

1058
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,380
Wait, oh he's not...oh shit.

1059
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:47,980
Nevermind.

1060
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:24,990
Okay, nice!

1061
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:25,330
Nice!

1062
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:26,670
Oh

1063
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:43,610
my god.

1064
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:43,870
Ouch!

1065
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:44,550
Ouch!

1066
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:45,170
Ouch!

1067
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:02,930
Got a bravo.

1068
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:04,110
Alright.

1069
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:06,190
Oh I need

1070
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:24,370
the...oh shit.

1071
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:24,750
Oh shit.

1072
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:24,970
Oh shit.

1073
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:26,250
Oh shit.

1074
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,560
Come on!

1075
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:36,940
Come on!

1076
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:37,480
Come on!

1077
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:38,980
Just a little bit more!

1078
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,140
Oh shoot.

1079
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,440
We did it!

1080
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:52,880
Nice!

1081
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:00,120
I didn't need the other orb.

1082
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,660
Ugly.

1083
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,040
Holy moly.

1084
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,820
Good riddance.

1085
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:21,380
Yeah, good riddance to you slimy poo-poo.

1086
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,820
There's a...oh.

1087
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,100
Please no more.

1088
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:26,500
Okay.

1089
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,720
Is that the end?

1090
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:32,460
Oh come on.

1091
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:36,900
I'm like shaking.

1092
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:38,820
I'm like shaking from...

1093
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:42,580
From that...

1094
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:43,080
Okay.

1095
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:43,240
Okay.

1096
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:47,880
When's the end of the chapter?

1097
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,560
Oh come on.

1098
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,960
Don't do this to me.

1099
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:57,240
No.

1100
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:02,920
Oh my god.

1101
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:06,600
Oh shoot.

1102
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:13,620
What's this?

1103
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:14,840
Nothing.

1104
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:15,400
Alright.

1105
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,900
The things.

1106
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,060
It's reacting to the growing evil surge of the darkness.

1107
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,280
Shall I use the staff of errors?

1108
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:25,380
Yes.

1109
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:26,880
Hermes.

1110
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,000
What is that?

1111
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,800
Oh the bedroom.

1112
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:39,880
Oh.

1113
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:53,100
Choose carefully.

1114
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:55,380
Fast travel.

1115
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:57,940
Left or right?

1116
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:00,080
For what?

1117
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:03,320
For what?

1118
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,920
Unravel the mystery.

1119
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:05,640
Okay.

1120
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,300
Flip a coin.

1121
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:19,140
Eenie meenie miney mo, catch a tiger by it's toe.

1122
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:22,240
If he hollers, let him go.

1123
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:30,020
My mom said to pick the very worst one.

1124
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,400
And you are it!

1125
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,660
Yippee!

1126
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:42,620
Night terror.

1127
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,460
Survive an encounter with nightmare.

1128
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:46,620
Yeah, I felt that.

1129
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:47,880
I felt that nightmare.

1130
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:50,580
You know what?

1131
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:52,040
Whatever.

1132
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:53,400
I'll take it.

1133
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,880
It's because I used two yorbs, isn't it?

1134
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:57,000
Isn't it?

1135
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:04,890
Save.

1136
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:06,670
Please.

1137
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:07,690
Thank you.

1138
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,080
Hopefully I made the right choice.

1139
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,020
Carded Memento.

1140
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,260
Slash away at the dragon.

1141
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:23,340
And enter the court with the quicksilver.

1142
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:25,240
What the hell does this mean?

1143
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,980
You guys, I can get Inferno.

1144
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,420
Wait, so is...

1145
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:34,880
I don't even see anything.

1146
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:36,100
Let's double jump here.

1147
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:39,620
I joined at a good time.

1148
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:46,620
Maybe I should stick with Alistair here too, maybe.

1149
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:53,670
Inferno is the equivalent of Air Hike.

1150
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:55,390
Oh, it doesn't get double jump.

1151
01:14:55,530 --> 01:15:00,330
Oh, I thought people were saying that I would have to buy double jump on Ifrit as well.

1152
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:01,430
Okay.

1153
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:02,870
That's kind of lame.

1154
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:06,690
Can I get a boar?

1155
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:11,450
I could buy him another yorb.

1156
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:14,450
But everyone tells me that buying yorbs is a scam.

1157
01:15:14,930 --> 01:15:16,670
I think having to buy anything is a scam.

1158
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:20,710
Oh, it's DMC3.

1159
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:26,610
Everybody is getting their games all confused and then you tell me the wrong information.

1160
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,400
Buy a blorb.

1161
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,020
Blorb and porb.

1162
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:37,960
I'll buy them both, baby.

1163
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:45,100
I have to slash away at a dragon.

1164
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,360
Or something.

1165
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:55,060
Okay.

1166
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:57,580
No rorbs?

1167
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,300
Cheap.

1168
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:00,160
Cheapo.

1169
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:02,200
Here we go.

1170
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:04,180
What do you mean baseball?

1171
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:11,020
That was easy.

1172
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,860
Yeah, give me all your rorbs.

1173
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:16,060
Give me all your rorbs.

1174
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,800
I gotta get my money's worth.

1175
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:31,140
Okay.

1176
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:34,540
Baseball.

1177
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:35,540
I'm going.

1178
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:36,080
I'm going.

1179
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:36,580
I'm going.

1180
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,480
See what baseball is all about.

1181
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:47,720
Oh, I think I heard the dragon.

1182
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,300
What is going on?

1183
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:52,800
Okay.

1184
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,700
Why didn't this one open too?

1185
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:01,040
Things

1186
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:11,220
are getting mighty spooky here you guys.

1187
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,860
Is that the dragon?

1188
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:21,650
It's Psycho Mantis.

1189
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:27,010
That was so unfair.

1190
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:32,790
Holy cow.

1191
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:42,290
I'm not afraid to use this on you.

1192
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:45,690
Where am I at anyway?

1193
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:46,870
Oh my god.

1194
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:47,950
Oh my god.

1195
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:51,250
Holy shit.

1196
01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:54,750
Oh my gosh.

1197
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:57,030
They hit like craziness.

1198
01:17:58,270 --> 01:17:58,830
Oh my god.

1199
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:07,800
These are not just normal guys you guys.

1200
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:15,220
These guys are crazy.

1201
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:16,520
I can't see anything.

1202
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:17,780
Bravo.

1203
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:18,320
Bravo.

1204
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:18,920
Yeah.

1205
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:20,860
We got one.

1206
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:21,480
We got one.

1207
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,220
We got two.

1208
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:30,800
Crazy.

1209
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:31,700
Absolutely.

1210
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,600
Hey, the door disappeared.

1211
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:38,840
I

1212
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:44,740
know where the money is hidden.

1213
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:45,100
Ah!

1214
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:56,760
Oh my gosh.

1215
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:59,440
You son of a bitch.

1216
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,940
Who the hell has fire?

1217
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:23,980
Stop it.

1218
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,440
Leave me alone.

1219
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:35,420
More grime.

1220
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:41,340
Ouch.

1221
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:41,560
Ouch.

1222
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:41,720
Ouch.

1223
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:41,940
Ouch.

1224
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:46,140
Another grime would be mighty appreciated here.

1225
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:50,820
Die.

1226
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:51,780
Stay down.

1227
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:53,760
What was down here anyway?

1228
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:56,280
Am I in a maze?

1229
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:57,620
Where is the dragon?

1230
01:19:59,180 --> 01:19:59,700
What's this?

1231
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:00,760
The door went open.

1232
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:02,080
There is a round hole in the center.

1233
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:04,400
Show the gem with the moonlight.

1234
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:04,680
Moonlight.

1235
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,200
Grorb or Gorb?

1236
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:11,760
Grorb.

1237
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,640
Oh yeah, Grorb.

1238
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:12,920
Sorry.

1239
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:16,380
I keep saying Gorb.

1240
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:17,180
The Grorb.

1241
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:18,720
Green orb.

1242
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:19,400
Grorb.

1243
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,360
I think I'm shooting at invisible enemies.

1244
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,100
Nevermind.

1245
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,840
That was not an invisible enemy.

1246
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:39,880
Here is the dragon.

1247
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:53,630
I can't see though the dragon.

1248
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:54,390
Oh my goodness.

1249
01:20:57,010 --> 01:20:57,610
Where?

1250
01:20:58,830 --> 01:20:59,530
What the hell?

1251
01:20:59,710 --> 01:21:01,530
A strange power has confronted me.

1252
01:21:02,230 --> 01:21:04,070
I've got to find a way to defeat the dragon.

1253
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:06,630
Okay.

1254
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:09,370
I'll come over this way.

1255
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,390
Gaze into the light.

1256
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:13,950
And that gave me a Blorb.

1257
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:17,010
How nice.

1258
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:17,690
Okay.

1259
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:19,530
Calm down, guy.

1260
01:21:19,730 --> 01:21:20,150
Please.

1261
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:21,750
Oh my gosh.

1262
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,730
It's literally a fossil.

1263
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:28,430
I'm not trying to be rude, but he is actually a fossil.

1264
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:34,610
I have to find a way to kill this fossil.

1265
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:38,450
What the hell?

1266
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:39,390
Are you kidding me?

1267
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:41,930
How did that hit?

1268
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:47,970
This is a dragon.

1269
01:21:55,730 --> 01:21:58,070
Is this what you meant by baseball?

1270
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:04,070
Okay.

1271
01:22:04,730 --> 01:22:08,670
Take me out to the ball game.

1272
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:14,090
Take me out to the crowd.

1273
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:19,450
Buy me some pizza and crackerjacks.

1274
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:23,510
I don't care if I never come back.

1275
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:25,070
Home run, baby.

1276
01:22:27,170 --> 01:22:31,050
Root, root, root for the home team.

1277
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:35,210
If they don't win, it's a shame.

1278
01:22:37,810 --> 01:22:38,310
Okay.

1279
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:39,670
I see the platforms.

1280
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:41,290
I see what I've got to do.

1281
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:45,010
This went lower, but it didn't do anything.

1282
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:49,790
I'm seeing if there is any delicious grorbs.

1283
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:52,570
But none seem to be about.

1284
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,600
Good job, Dante.

1285
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:14,950
I can't see my depth perception.

1286
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:17,430
Okay.

1287
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:17,870
I made it.

1288
01:23:17,970 --> 01:23:18,290
I made it.

1289
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:25,170
Oh my gosh, that's my own shadow.

1290
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:26,730
Oh my god, that scared me.

1291
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:28,750
Okay, nice.

1292
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:30,990
I'm too afraid.

1293
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:36,790
Don't trust me.

1294
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,800
Next one, next one.

1295
01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:56,190
Okay, next one, next one.

1296
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:03,470
It's a device to gather moonlight.

1297
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:12,710
I don't have anything to collect the moonlight.

1298
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:15,510
A stone, perhaps?

1299
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:15,630
Perhaps.

1300
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:23,310
We need the stone.

1301
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:25,250
Wait, it didn't pull the crank.

1302
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:25,830
What crank?

1303
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:32,740
Wait, what crank?

1304
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:40,920
We need the stone that will... Is it in these little rooms?

1305
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:44,940
What's...

1306
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:50,600
These little rooms.

1307
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:53,060
None of them are open.

1308
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,620
Make your streams of healthy feel happy.

1309
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:56,580
Thank you.

1310
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:58,200
Thank you, Yoshi.

1311
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,800
I'm so happy to hear that.

1312
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,300
Thank you.

1313
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,040
Ignore chat and look around.

1314
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:07,740
That's what I'm doing.

1315
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:09,680
I'm looking around, you guys.

1316
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:10,660
I'll figure it out.

1317
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:13,320
So there is a... Oh, a lady.

1318
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:15,700
Oh la la.

1319
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:16,960
Oh, what's this?

1320
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:17,860
There is something written.

1321
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:19,880
The confronter of the path.

1322
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,520
Pluto's dragon.

1323
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:27,320
Prove your bravery with your sword and the dragon will fall in its own flame.

1324
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:28,520
Oh,

1325
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,820
I can be faster.

1326
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,780
I was like cranking like an old man.

1327
01:25:51,570 --> 01:25:52,730
Collected the moonlight.

1328
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:55,130
Look at all these ladies.

1329
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:56,950
Hot mamas.

1330
01:25:57,070 --> 01:25:58,890
How did I miss this when I first came in?

1331
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:01,730
I think I was more concerned about, you know...

1332
01:26:02,670 --> 01:26:05,730
The dragon that was attacking me and...

1333
01:26:06,850 --> 01:26:08,330
All that fun stuff.

1334
01:26:09,450 --> 01:26:11,710
We were more a little concerned about, you know.

1335
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:15,010
Oh, dang it.

1336
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:15,770
Sorry, you guys.

1337
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:26,530
I did it once and now I'll never be able to do it again.

1338
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:33,730
Lightning!

1339
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:53,080
I don't need no lightning.

1340
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:03,720
Why does it sound like the dragon is still here with us?

1341
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:04,480
Okay.

1342
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:08,640
We've got the quicksilver.

1343
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:10,220
A crystal ball filled with mercury.

1344
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:13,360
The mercury has lunar powers that will open sealed doors.

1345
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:18,780
Thank you, I guess, guys, for telling me about the baseball.

1346
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:20,260
Griffo!

1347
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,300
Welcome to membership.

1348
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:22,060
Thank you.

1349
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:25,900
Because I missed the stone that explained the baseball.

1350
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,840
I missed the stone that explained it.

1351
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,900
I was so concerned with the dragon itself.

1352
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:38,850
Go away.

1353
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:40,010
Wait, is there any... Oh, nope.

1354
01:27:40,030 --> 01:27:40,850
That door is gone.

1355
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:48,130
Nice!

1356
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:53,810
This side!

1357
01:27:57,310 --> 01:27:58,070
Blow up!

1358
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:02,650
The door won't open.

1359
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:03,570
There's a round hole in the center.

1360
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:05,550
Quicksilver, yes!

1361
01:28:09,730 --> 01:28:11,090
We made it.

1362
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:25,380
No, no, no.

1363
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:26,620
Please, no.

1364
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:30,640
I like that.

1365
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:41,580
Those are some fancy moves you got.

1366
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:52,620
No!

1367
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:53,740
Oh my god, my eyes.

1368
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:03,700
Oh, he took off his mask.

1369
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,140
Oh no, he's hot.

1370
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:13,080
Oh shit.

1371
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,580
I'm just gonna devil trigger and immediately start blasting him.

1372
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:23,390
Oh, I'm taking hits.

1373
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:25,490
Why am I the one taking hits?

1374
01:29:27,010 --> 01:29:27,190
All

1375
01:29:33,070 --> 01:29:33,910
over again, please.

1376
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:36,170
Sir, please.

1377
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:38,990
Why do I have to fuck you again?

1378
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:41,890
Mundus!

1379
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:44,510
Not Mundus, but you serve Mundus.

1380
01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:46,770
Oh my god.

1381
01:29:55,970 --> 01:29:57,650
Stop blocking my attacks!

1382
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:03,880
Oh my god.

1383
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:05,600
Holy moly.

1384
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,860
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1385
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:16,360
Okay, when all the swords happen, maybe don't be up in the air, I guess.

1386
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:26,920
You can start again from a save point.

1387
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:28,840
When did I last save?

1388
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:34,260
When did I last save?

1389
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:36,220
Oh no.

1390
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:41,680
Okay.

1391
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,000
Well, I would have to do this all over again anyway.

1392
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:48,600
Messed up.

1393
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:49,820
So messed up.

1394
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:53,580
No, we're gonna have to do this stage all over again.

1395
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:57,700
But I didn't save, so I didn't get any of my roars.

1396
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:03,300
Can you aim for the guy that's there on the ground?

1397
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:06,660
Oh man.

1398
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:12,180
Yeah, I noticed he was blocking my air raid.

1399
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:18,500
When he stopped blocking it, I would attack.

1400
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:22,680
But I noticed he was doing that too.

1401
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,240
Definitely noticed that.

1402
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:37,910
Did I

1403
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:43,500
save before the dragon?

1404
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,300
That would have been awesome.

1405
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:44,760
Oh wait.

1406
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,300
Oh no!

1407
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:47,400
Oh no!

1408
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:49,060
I have to do these guys again too!

1409
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:51,140
Oh no!

1410
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,940
Oh my gosh.

1411
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:55,260
Oh my god.

1412
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:05,140
Oh, this is so evil!

1413
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:06,700
These guys suck!

1414
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:11,520
I wonder.

1415
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:12,220
Hold on.

1416
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:17,740
If I change to this because it's a fire weapon, would that be better?

1417
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:20,120
Let's see.

1418
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:21,560
Oh my god.

1419
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:30,100
Oh!

1420
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:30,660
Oh!

1421
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:31,220
Run!

1422
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:31,820
Run Dante!

1423
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:32,700
Dante, run!

1424
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:39,500
Oh my god.

1425
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:41,500
Can you at least get a hit in, man?

1426
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:42,620
Can you do anything?

1427
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:44,460
Oh!

1428
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:47,180
Wait, I think I... I'm about to die.

1429
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:48,420
Oh my god, I'm about to die.

1430
01:32:56,060 --> 01:32:59,700
This is me not getting a lot of practice in with him.

1431
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:12,120
Oh my gosh, so evil.

1432
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:16,740
Oh wait,

1433
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:22,540
I'm gonna have to fight them again.

1434
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:24,800
Remember to smiley.

1435
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:28,240
Oh, if there were any spoilers, you guys...

1436
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:33,780
Please, this is my first time playing, so no spoilers on stuff!

1437
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:35,540
Take

1438
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:50,020
care of this guy right now, but I will.

1439
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:55,180
I blasted him.

1440
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:04,440
Please.

1441
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,120
Did I die?

1442
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:07,360
Wait, where am I?

1443
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:10,300
Why was I not doing any damage?

1444
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:13,620
That was so weird.

1445
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:16,600
Why was I not attacking?

1446
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:23,060
I got strung up.

1447
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:27,050
Nice gorb.

1448
01:34:27,050 --> 01:34:27,150
Oh.

1449
01:34:32,490 --> 01:34:33,590
This strung me up.

1450
01:34:36,990 --> 01:34:39,490
I need to

1451
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:46,570
heal more.

1452
01:34:47,490 --> 01:34:48,810
I don't think this is the run, you guys.

1453
01:34:50,690 --> 01:34:51,110
Oh my god.

1454
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:54,550
I don't think this is the run.

1455
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:57,070
I guess we'll see.

1456
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:10,500
Oh, ok.

1457
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:27,870
Strike.

1458
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:30,250
Oh, and then it appears again.

1459
01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:41,170
I should really offer some gorbs before this part.

1460
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:43,310
Or before the fight.

1461
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:45,350
You know?

1462
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:50,140
I should offer some gorbs.

1463
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:57,840
But they don't.

1464
01:35:57,880 --> 01:35:58,840
They're so rude.

1465
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:06,590
I will save so we can at least keep our rorbs.

1466
01:36:07,190 --> 01:36:08,490
How many rorbs do I even have?

1467
01:36:10,570 --> 01:36:12,550
We have 2,500.

1468
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:36,450
I do have... I actually do have some, like, things for healing.

1469
01:36:36,690 --> 01:36:37,190
I think?

1470
01:36:37,390 --> 01:36:38,010
Or maybe I don't.

1471
01:36:38,030 --> 01:36:38,810
I have a devil star.

1472
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:42,370
Can you imagine if this worked?

1473
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:52,380
Ugh.

1474
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:54,340
Ok.

1475
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:56,000
I guess maybe I...

1476
01:36:57,940 --> 01:37:00,400
We can farm the puppet hall for gorbs.

1477
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:01,440
I think I have to.

1478
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:04,000
But I'm still... I'm nervous because...

1479
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:06,360
Oh my god.

1480
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:07,420
I'm too good at this now.

1481
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:13,040
I'm nervous because my health... I haven't been doing a very good job.

1482
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:17,880
I haven't been doing a very good job.

1483
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:20,740
I don't know where... if there is a shop.

1484
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:23,940
Maybe... Oh, nice.

1485
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,460
Oh, that gorb did wonders.

1486
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:39,300
Maybe I can farm these guys a little bit more.

1487
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:43,560
Where is he?

1488
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,000
I heard him.

1489
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:47,780
Or I'm going crazy.

1490
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:58,060
At least it doesn't take much to get back to this point, I suppose.

1491
01:37:59,180 --> 01:37:59,480
Ok.

1492
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:05,920
Yes.

1493
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:12,120
This boss is decently hard, so don't feel bad.

1494
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:15,740
But everyone said the nightmare was the most difficult.

1495
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:40,520
Let's go.

1496
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:41,720
Ok, let's just...

1497
01:38:42,470 --> 01:38:44,240
This music is crazy.

1498
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:48,280
Ouch!

1499
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:48,720
Ouch!

1500
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:49,060
Ouch!

1501
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:49,360
Ouch!

1502
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:49,720
Perry!

1503
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:56,460
Oh my god, where did he go?

1504
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:09,490
Oh my god, this is so evil, please!

1505
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:12,770
Ouch!

1506
01:39:12,870 --> 01:39:13,050
Ouch!

1507
01:39:13,110 --> 01:39:13,250
Ouch!

1508
01:39:13,490 --> 01:39:13,490
Ouch!

1509
01:39:14,270 --> 01:39:14,990
I'm going to double check.

1510
01:39:18,190 --> 01:39:18,830
He's huge!

1511
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:19,930
This guy is huge!

1512
01:39:20,150 --> 01:39:20,150
Huge!

1513
01:39:21,310 --> 01:39:21,630
Ginormous!

1514
01:39:21,690 --> 01:39:22,230
Oh my god, wait.

1515
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:23,090
I didn't mean to do that.

1516
01:39:26,370 --> 01:39:27,550
Guys, this is not the run.

1517
01:39:28,290 --> 01:39:29,330
I can't see!

1518
01:39:30,490 --> 01:39:32,450
I'm not trying to turn into this guy.

1519
01:39:32,890 --> 01:39:34,770
I'm just trying to...

1520
01:39:38,860 --> 01:39:43,300
I'm trying not to... I don't want to turn into the flying guy.

1521
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:46,680
I keep... Because I keep holding it down to aim.

1522
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:02,820
Camera angle is the real boss.

1523
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:03,820
Actually, though.

1524
01:40:15,650 --> 01:40:16,250
Oh...

1525
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:23,200
I feel like I...

1526
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:35,940
Use Ifrit instead because I keep accidentally turning into the flying guy.

1527
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:39,380
Holy water works on him?

1528
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:40,780
Don't get my hopes up.

1529
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:45,660
I need more than one person to say... I need at least 50 people to say that.

1530
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:48,740
Before I believe it.

1531
01:40:54,330 --> 01:40:55,730
It will do damage.

1532
01:40:56,430 --> 01:40:57,490
Does a ton of damage.

1533
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:01,070
Holy water is what I always use here.

1534
01:41:01,790 --> 01:41:02,070
Okay.

1535
01:41:03,450 --> 01:41:03,890
Okay.

1536
01:41:04,290 --> 01:41:06,730
I have a few bits of holy water.

1537
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:10,930
But because I keep turning into the flying guy and that is not effective against him...

1538
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:15,390
I wonder if I should be Ifrit.

1539
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:16,690
If I should do this instead.

1540
01:41:16,690 --> 01:41:18,770
But I can only really level up.

1541
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:21,530
I can't even get Infernal.

1542
01:41:23,690 --> 01:41:25,050
Let's try again.

1543
01:41:25,770 --> 01:41:27,690
And try and get more orbs.

1544
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:29,690
And then I can maybe...

1545
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:32,670
Maybe...

1546
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:35,550
Eventually...

1547
01:41:37,570 --> 01:41:39,170
Get the...

1548
01:41:39,990 --> 01:41:42,690
Maybe eventually get the...

1549
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:44,410
The...

1550
01:41:45,130 --> 01:41:46,290
The Infernal.

1551
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:57,080
Do you get more orbs with killing things in more style?

1552
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,080
Or is it just gotcha?

1553
01:42:04,710 --> 01:42:06,050
Yes, I figured.

1554
01:42:10,710 --> 01:42:11,810
I figured.

1555
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:15,890
Holy water does good damage if you don't miss.

1556
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:18,910
That's the other thing.

1557
01:42:32,710 --> 01:42:35,170
I guess I'll try Ifrit here.

1558
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:43,330
Wait, what's the other one?

1559
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:48,190
He has two.

1560
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:51,750
Why in Dante's back?

1561
01:42:52,610 --> 01:42:53,430
Dante's face.

1562
01:42:53,510 --> 01:42:54,470
That's what I tried though.

1563
01:42:57,370 --> 01:42:59,290
Maybe... Hold on, the camera angle is a little weird.

1564
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:04,990
That was Dante's back and this is Dante's front.

1565
01:43:05,150 --> 01:43:05,730
Oh, there we go.

1566
01:43:05,730 --> 01:43:05,790
There we go.

1567
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:21,380
Holy moly!

1568
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:33,220
Yeah, lizard!

1569
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,040
Charge your punches.

1570
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:39,800
How do I do that?

1571
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,540
I just like, hold it?

1572
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:53,740
Let's turn back to this since it works here.

1573
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:57,240
Wow, that was so easy.

1574
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:02,420
Oh, sorry.

1575
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:03,980
My style points.

1576
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:15,360
Oh yeah, we got some crazy numbers there.

1577
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,360
Okay, I'll try not to use my gun at all.

1578
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:33,500
Cool!

1579
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:37,180
Is there anyone else?

1580
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:42,600
Full health.

1581
01:44:42,940 --> 01:44:44,340
Everything is good good.

1582
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:50,160
Let's wait for him to do the first shot.

1583
01:44:51,740 --> 01:44:52,540
Alright.

1584
01:44:55,310 --> 01:44:59,610
Take me out to the ball game.

1585
01:44:59,610 --> 01:45:03,450
Take me out to the crowd.

1586
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:10,490
Buy me some pizza and crackers.

1587
01:45:11,290 --> 01:45:14,370
I always gotta get hit by one.

1588
01:45:19,630 --> 01:45:21,050
You're out!

1589
01:45:23,730 --> 01:45:25,530
Good timings, nevermind.

1590
01:45:25,530 --> 01:45:25,790
Hey!

1591
01:45:28,390 --> 01:45:30,350
There was a timing.

1592
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:39,450
Old man Dante trying to turn this crank.

1593
01:45:40,690 --> 01:45:41,470
Come on Dante!

1594
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:45,190
You got this!

1595
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:01,080
Oops.

1596
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:01,440
Oh

1597
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:11,720
no!

1598
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:14,680
I knew I was going crooked.

1599
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:29,620
Let's double jump.

1600
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:32,500
It's just way easier to make it.

1601
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:37,400
And jump!

1602
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:39,600
And jump!

1603
01:46:43,740 --> 01:46:44,700
Quick silver.

1604
01:46:50,890 --> 01:46:52,990
I'm scared of this guy.

1605
01:46:54,710 --> 01:46:56,550
Shadow on the pillar startles me.

1606
01:46:56,630 --> 01:46:57,190
Me too.

1607
01:46:58,870 --> 01:46:59,830
Every time.

1608
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:02,970
Let's overwrite.

1609
01:47:03,170 --> 01:47:05,050
I'll do it right before I get to the door too though.

1610
01:47:05,070 --> 01:47:07,450
Since we get some more rorbs in this hallway.

1611
01:47:07,690 --> 01:47:08,230
I keep forgetting.

1612
01:47:10,610 --> 01:47:11,070
Okay.

1613
01:47:15,650 --> 01:47:18,230
What mission was this again?

1614
01:47:19,570 --> 01:47:20,410
Oh, whoopsie.

1615
01:47:20,710 --> 01:47:20,970
Sorry.

1616
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:32,920
Yay!

1617
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:33,440
Yay!

1618
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:34,260
Oh,

1619
01:47:44,770 --> 01:47:45,090
over here.

1620
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,320
Cool!

1621
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:51,660
Cool!

1622
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:54,220
Is that it?

1623
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:55,200
Is that all of them?

1624
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:56,920
17?

1625
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:57,380
Oh!

1626
01:47:57,820 --> 01:47:58,960
That was not all of them.

1627
01:47:59,180 --> 01:47:59,620
Oh my gosh!

1628
01:47:59,740 --> 01:48:00,400
There's more of them!

1629
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:02,000
I think they're coming through the portal.

1630
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:05,760
Ouch!

1631
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:06,060
Ouch!

1632
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:06,200
Ouch!

1633
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:08,400
You better give me a grorb now mister.

1634
01:48:08,860 --> 01:48:10,060
I was full health!

1635
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:11,400
You asshole!

1636
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:13,460
Thank you.

1637
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:16,660
I think there's some more rorbs back here.

1638
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,800
Ask and you shall receive everybody.

1639
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:31,740
Save so we keep our rorbs.

1640
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:36,560
And we're at 2-9.

1641
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:38,740
Almost 3,000.

1642
01:48:56,110 --> 01:48:57,590
Time for cheese.

1643
01:48:57,810 --> 01:48:58,670
How do I cheese?

1644
01:49:01,190 --> 01:49:02,670
Oh wait, I was gonna...

1645
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:04,670
Oh wait, well...

1646
01:49:05,490 --> 01:49:06,430
No, I think I should.

1647
01:49:07,430 --> 01:49:08,930
I think I should switch.

1648
01:49:10,030 --> 01:49:11,470
I think I should switch.

1649
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,480
Alright, let's go baby!

1650
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:20,700
Okay.

1651
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:25,000
Stop taunting me!

1652
01:49:28,460 --> 01:49:30,020
Oh, it opens up his defense?

1653
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:31,560
Oh, come on.

1654
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:32,620
Shoot!

1655
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:34,880
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1656
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:40,380
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

1657
01:49:45,540 --> 01:49:46,320
Oh my god.

1658
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:47,280
Oh no!

1659
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:50,360
What is this combo you do?

1660
01:49:50,780 --> 01:49:52,120
No way man!

1661
01:49:57,440 --> 01:50:00,300
I barely...I can't even get him to halfway health.

1662
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:04,840
I can't even get him to halfway health.

1663
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:06,080
Oh gosh.

1664
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:09,680
Oh my gosh, the amount of damage he does is crazy.

1665
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:20,720
And I'm not used to his moves yet.

1666
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:22,880
This is gonna take me forever.

1667
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:27,040
I'm not used to his moves yet.

1668
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:29,400
Can we power up Ifrit?

1669
01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:33,260
Maybe I should do kick level 2.

1670
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:35,840
This is why kick is forward.

1671
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:41,080
But I wanna maybe wait for Inferno.

1672
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:44,120
And I didn't even use the holy water.

1673
01:50:47,980 --> 01:50:51,100
He's a critical boss for the story so they make him mad hard.

1674
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:53,540
Yeah, I can kinda tell he's a little important.

1675
01:50:58,200 --> 01:50:59,420
Kick level 2 is good.

1676
01:51:09,090 --> 01:51:12,450
It'll waste all...or not waste, but it'll use all my...

1677
01:51:12,450 --> 01:51:13,990
Almost all my roars.

1678
01:51:23,070 --> 01:51:25,450
How much is like a...what is it?

1679
01:51:25,450 --> 01:51:26,190
Not holy water.

1680
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:28,310
Because like I said, I have a couple of those, I'm pretty sure.

1681
01:51:29,490 --> 01:51:31,390
It's vital star.

1682
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:39,390
Wait, untouchable?

1683
01:51:39,550 --> 01:51:40,210
Is that any good?

1684
01:51:42,410 --> 01:51:44,070
Should we become untouchable?

1685
01:51:44,310 --> 01:51:45,430
How long does that last even?

1686
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:47,490
Hi Batboy!

1687
01:51:47,690 --> 01:51:48,190
Thanks for the gift.

1688
01:51:53,230 --> 01:51:55,150
I honestly didn't know you could cheese him.

1689
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:56,190
What is the cheese?

1690
01:51:56,190 --> 01:51:58,370
You guys, what's the cheese?

1691
01:51:59,710 --> 01:52:01,150
Can you tell me the cheese?

1692
01:52:04,210 --> 01:52:05,170
30 seconds.

1693
01:52:08,590 --> 01:52:09,390
Holy water?

1694
01:52:09,790 --> 01:52:11,310
Oh, just the holy water is the cheese?

1695
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:16,290
Does he have any iframes like after you holy water?

1696
01:52:16,810 --> 01:52:18,090
Or could you spam it?

1697
01:52:19,190 --> 01:52:20,830
Johnny, thanks for the 5 gifted.

1698
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:24,570
The cheese.

1699
01:52:24,830 --> 01:52:25,350
Pepperjack.

1700
01:52:31,660 --> 01:52:35,420
I guess I should get some vital stars.

1701
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:38,280
Oh, sorry.

1702
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:40,560
A singular vital star.

1703
01:52:41,540 --> 01:52:42,940
You cannot hold anymore of this item.

1704
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:44,960
Gabe, I only have one.

1705
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:45,740
What do you mean?

1706
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:50,260
I can still get kick level too.

1707
01:52:56,070 --> 01:52:56,970
I got it.

1708
01:52:58,530 --> 01:52:59,470
I got it.

1709
01:53:00,990 --> 01:53:02,710
It takes up too much space.

1710
01:53:03,450 --> 01:53:04,030
What's up big boy?

1711
01:53:04,130 --> 01:53:05,590
Yeah, I have three holy waters.

1712
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:07,250
So I think we'll be okay for now.

1713
01:53:07,850 --> 01:53:08,590
Wait, what do I have?

1714
01:53:08,670 --> 01:53:09,030
Okay, good.

1715
01:53:11,670 --> 01:53:12,770
We kickin' boys.

1716
01:53:12,870 --> 01:53:13,550
We kickin'.

1717
01:53:13,550 --> 01:53:13,890
Hopefully.

1718
01:53:14,430 --> 01:53:15,530
Hopefully I can kick well.

1719
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:18,810
Hopefully I can do the kick.

1720
01:53:26,770 --> 01:53:30,890
Wow, shooting him and attacking him like that gave me the same amount.

1721
01:53:31,530 --> 01:53:31,990
Oh well.

1722
01:53:33,330 --> 01:53:34,590
I'm not salty or anything.

1723
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:52,260
I don't know why I feel like this gives me something when I know it doesn't.

1724
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:54,300
To the outside!

1725
01:54:05,420 --> 01:54:07,520
We kickin'.

1726
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:10,180
We kickin'.

1727
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:14,740
I'm still kickin'.

1728
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:20,440
We get

1729
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:40,200
him in the...

1730
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:52,520
Let's switch back to...

1731
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:54,440
Yeah.

1732
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:02,580
R3 to switch the sword.

1733
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:06,000
Oh that's right.

1734
01:55:06,140 --> 01:55:07,380
I forgot I can do it like that.

1735
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:08,540
Thank you for reminding me.

1736
01:55:15,870 --> 01:55:17,050
Grab my rorbs.

1737
01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:18,990
Oh my god!

1738
01:55:19,510 --> 01:55:23,310
Give me a rorb for that please.

1739
01:55:24,110 --> 01:55:26,830
Oh my gosh.

1740
01:55:34,150 --> 01:55:35,370
Screw it.

1741
01:55:35,790 --> 01:55:37,070
I'm double triggering now.

1742
01:55:38,030 --> 01:55:39,410
I don't care anymore.

1743
01:55:41,130 --> 01:55:42,690
Oh, I got him.

1744
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:49,860
They don't stop coming.

1745
01:55:49,980 --> 01:55:51,740
Oh my gosh, they are all spotted.

1746
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:53,420
So much right here.

1747
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:54,720
Holy moly.

1748
01:55:58,300 --> 01:55:58,860
Shoot!

1749
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:00,280
Fine.

1750
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:00,960
You know what?

1751
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:01,620
Fine.

1752
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:03,880
Yeah, you want a piece of this?

1753
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:06,680
I did so well with the other guys.

1754
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:10,620
And then I just...

1755
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:11,240
Whatever.

1756
01:56:11,620 --> 01:56:12,940
With these guys...

1757
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:15,660
I think I get like... What's the word?

1758
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:18,520
Not cocky, but like overly confident.

1759
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:21,660
Because there's this kind of dudes in the hallway.

1760
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:23,880
Oh.

1761
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:25,500
You weren't done.

1762
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:36,470
So cocky.

1763
01:56:36,650 --> 01:56:36,970
No!

1764
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:39,850
I think cocky would be me being like...

1765
01:56:42,090 --> 01:56:43,850
But I'm just like...

1766
01:56:45,010 --> 01:56:48,230
It's like a little... Oh, get out of my way.

1767
01:56:49,450 --> 01:56:50,490
Little guys.

1768
01:56:52,870 --> 01:56:53,590
It's fine.

1769
01:56:54,030 --> 01:56:55,190
Get complacent.

1770
01:56:55,430 --> 01:56:55,870
Sure, sure.

1771
01:56:57,770 --> 01:56:59,650
Hold on, I gotta turn on my fan.

1772
01:57:00,850 --> 01:57:02,270
It's toasty in my room.

1773
01:57:02,270 --> 01:57:03,270
OK.

1774
01:57:28,450 --> 01:57:29,130
Easy.

1775
01:57:30,330 --> 01:57:30,870
Easy.

1776
01:57:33,490 --> 01:57:36,230
I'm gonna be a master at this section and this section alone.

1777
01:57:38,590 --> 01:57:39,150
Go!

1778
01:57:39,270 --> 01:57:39,770
Go Dante!

1779
01:57:40,150 --> 01:57:40,550
Turn!

1780
01:57:40,990 --> 01:57:42,110
It's so...

1781
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:50,940
It's so silly.

1782
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:53,820
It's so like stiff when you turn it.

1783
01:58:02,740 --> 01:58:05,440
I don't know why I don't double jump there.

1784
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:09,940
That was close.

1785
01:58:18,750 --> 01:58:20,930
This checkpoint placement is brutal.

1786
01:58:21,810 --> 01:58:23,530
Yeah, it's not very kind, is it?

1787
01:58:24,930 --> 01:58:26,710
I have 700 rorbs.

1788
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:26,970
OK.

1789
01:58:28,830 --> 01:58:30,530
Yeah, it's not very kind.

1790
01:58:32,690 --> 01:58:33,670
It's fine.

1791
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:53,720
Yeah, I'm just gonna take out these guys right quick.

1792
01:58:57,100 --> 01:58:58,760
And then save.

1793
01:59:00,740 --> 01:59:01,280
Nice.

1794
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:02,940
We'll save.

1795
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:04,800
Well, I guess it doesn't matter where we save.

1796
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:08,520
Cause it doesn't really matter.

1797
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:10,420
It doesn't really matter.

1798
01:59:11,740 --> 01:59:12,300
OK.

1799
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:22,560
I'm gonna think of... I'm gonna think of chapter 17.

1800
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:27,360
Wait, I almost said number 15 like the Burger King foot lettuce.

1801
01:59:28,460 --> 01:59:29,840
I'm gonna think of...

1802
01:59:30,820 --> 01:59:37,120
I'm gonna think of chapter 17 for the rest of my afterlife.

1803
01:59:43,860 --> 01:59:44,300
OK.

1804
01:59:50,330 --> 01:59:51,210
Holy water!

1805
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:57,060
And I have vital star.

1806
02:00:01,510 --> 02:00:04,610
For the holy water...

1807
02:00:04,610 --> 02:00:07,470
If I'm like right on top of him, will that hit him, right?

1808
02:00:07,470 --> 02:00:08,610
Don't miss.

1809
02:00:08,690 --> 02:00:11,430
Like, I don't think I've used it enough to really know how it works.

1810
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:19,500
He does need to be close.

1811
02:00:21,140 --> 02:00:21,340
OK.

1812
02:00:27,030 --> 02:00:28,150
Reminder about quick switch.

1813
02:00:28,250 --> 02:00:28,670
Thank you.

1814
02:00:29,210 --> 02:00:30,450
As long as he doesn't teleport.

1815
02:00:30,710 --> 02:00:30,890
OK.

1816
02:00:33,290 --> 02:00:38,890
Double star is just what will recover my double trigger, so that will be good too, obviously.

1817
02:00:40,750 --> 02:00:42,890
But for damage to him...

1818
02:00:50,150 --> 02:00:51,230
Oh shoot!

1819
02:00:51,890 --> 02:00:54,910
Oh wait, so if I do it like now...

1820
02:00:54,910 --> 02:00:55,970
Holy water!

1821
02:01:00,410 --> 02:01:01,810
Holy water!

1822
02:01:02,110 --> 02:01:03,590
Holy water!

1823
02:01:05,650 --> 02:01:07,710
Holy water, man!

1824
02:01:08,710 --> 02:01:09,590
Oh shoot.

1825
02:01:09,790 --> 02:01:11,050
Oh, wait.

1826
02:01:11,890 --> 02:01:12,630
Vital star.

1827
02:01:16,470 --> 02:01:18,110
And then...

1828
02:01:18,710 --> 02:01:19,590
Let it recover.

1829
02:01:20,230 --> 02:01:21,670
And then...

1830
02:01:21,670 --> 02:01:23,190
Wait, is he about to teleport?

1831
02:01:24,110 --> 02:01:24,430
Yes.

1832
02:01:26,450 --> 02:01:27,210
Double star.

1833
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:32,110
Shoot.

1834
02:01:32,570 --> 02:01:33,210
Wait, wait.

1835
02:01:34,510 --> 02:01:35,350
Hold on.

1836
02:01:36,350 --> 02:01:37,290
Oh shoot!

1837
02:01:37,370 --> 02:01:37,870
No, no, no.

1838
02:01:37,910 --> 02:01:39,570
Holy water!

1839
02:01:46,510 --> 02:01:48,370
Wait, is this phase 2?

1840
02:01:49,850 --> 02:01:50,790
Is this phase 2?

1841
02:01:52,090 --> 02:01:52,970
No way.

1842
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:05,060
A win is a win.

1843
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:09,680
Wait a second.

1844
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:10,440
That's our necklace.

1845
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:16,140
That's the one that our mom gave us.

1846
02:02:17,260 --> 02:02:19,500
Wait, why did...Did he take our necklace?

1847
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:28,740
He's our mom!

1848
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:32,080
Oh my gosh!

1849
02:02:34,020 --> 02:02:35,800
I've always wanted a brother.

1850
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:38,240
Oh my gosh!

1851
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:40,080
It's...

1852
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:41,080
Virgil!

1853
02:02:43,120 --> 02:02:44,100
It was our brother!

1854
02:02:49,310 --> 02:02:50,890
But we thought he was dead.

1855
02:02:53,190 --> 02:02:54,850
Yes, my master.

1856
02:02:56,770 --> 02:02:58,890
Oh my god!

1857
02:02:59,430 --> 02:03:00,230
Yippee!

1858
02:03:00,370 --> 02:03:02,050
We finally got through it.

1859
02:03:02,930 --> 02:03:04,170
A win is a win, baby.

1860
02:03:06,050 --> 02:03:07,210
Shut up, game.

1861
02:03:08,270 --> 02:03:09,570
Boss bonus, baby.

1862
02:03:13,410 --> 02:03:14,630
Don't look at the score.

1863
02:03:14,790 --> 02:03:15,750
Don't care about it.

1864
02:03:15,870 --> 02:03:16,430
We don't care.

1865
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:18,110
A win is a win.

1866
02:03:19,470 --> 02:03:20,450
A win is a win.

1867
02:03:22,110 --> 02:03:23,630
Oh my gosh, I can't believe it was our brother.

1868
02:03:24,690 --> 02:03:26,510
I thought it was our...not dad.

1869
02:03:27,350 --> 02:03:28,790
Spirit stone elixir.

1870
02:03:29,370 --> 02:03:30,430
You were thinking it was dad.

1871
02:03:30,730 --> 02:03:32,590
You thinking it was dad wasn't too far off.

1872
02:03:32,670 --> 02:03:33,570
Yeah, basically.

1873
02:03:34,990 --> 02:03:37,370
Thanks for four months, mustache man.

1874
02:03:37,370 --> 02:03:42,590
Throw the philosopher's egg into the fire and transform it into a spirit stone.

1875
02:03:42,770 --> 02:03:46,350
They just say things in this game.

1876
02:03:52,590 --> 02:03:56,190
The combined form of Dante's pendant and Dark Knight's pendant.

1877
02:03:56,350 --> 02:03:58,190
It allows entry into the underworld.

1878
02:04:08,060 --> 02:04:10,300
Oh my gosh, I'm Devil May Cry.

1879
02:04:16,740 --> 02:04:17,480
Oh!

1880
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:24,180
Oh my god.

1881
02:04:25,220 --> 02:04:27,120
I'm basically Sparda.

1882
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:29,480
Oh!

1883
02:04:29,700 --> 02:04:30,940
I am Sparda!

1884
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:36,080
It's the true form of the Force Edge.

1885
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:39,380
The sword wielded by the legendary Dark Knight Sparda.

1886
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:42,940
It's loud.

1887
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:43,500
Oh my gosh.

1888
02:04:48,670 --> 02:04:49,370
Yippee!

1889
02:04:51,470 --> 02:04:53,450
Wait, so if I...

1890
02:04:53,970 --> 02:04:54,910
Oh wow.

1891
02:04:55,990 --> 02:04:57,810
I want to play with it.

1892
02:04:59,730 --> 02:05:02,450
Wait, how do I...

1893
02:05:03,790 --> 02:05:05,270
How do I play with it?

1894
02:05:10,540 --> 02:05:12,420
It has no DT though.

1895
02:05:15,450 --> 02:05:16,540
It's kind of lame.

1896
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:19,800
Hold on, I'm checking around.

1897
02:05:20,480 --> 02:05:22,800
Oh wow, my throne.

1898
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:27,920
I see no... Do I need any grorbs?

1899
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:28,960
Oh, I don't actually.

1900
02:05:35,110 --> 02:05:36,030
Here we go.

1901
02:05:41,220 --> 02:05:42,640
Oh, the other side opened up.

1902
02:05:43,060 --> 02:05:43,400
Nice.

1903
02:05:45,680 --> 02:05:47,300
But was there anything else in here?

1904
02:05:47,320 --> 02:05:48,500
I destroyed the chair earlier.

1905
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:55,980
It's basically a beefed up Alistair.

1906
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:58,460
Oh no!

1907
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:00,060
Wait, oh no!

1908
02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:05,000
Grorb.

1909
02:06:06,060 --> 02:06:06,520
Oh gosh.

1910
02:06:09,680 --> 02:06:12,480
Ew, this water is nasty and disgusting.

1911
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:13,500
What is that?

1912
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:15,280
Oh, gross.

1913
02:06:16,060 --> 02:06:17,680
Oh my god, why did you do this?

1914
02:06:17,780 --> 02:06:19,240
Wait, can I...

1915
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:24,600
How do I... Wait, how do I attack again in the water?

1916
02:06:26,680 --> 02:06:28,240
Shouldn't it like...

1917
02:06:29,800 --> 02:06:31,960
How do I attack again in the water?

1918
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:33,580
Shoot?

1919
02:06:34,260 --> 02:06:35,800
Oh, is it just shoot?

1920
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:37,300
Oh, there we go.

1921
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:37,560
I

1922
02:06:41,810 --> 02:06:48,570
feel like these are traps.

1923
02:06:48,570 --> 02:06:49,350
What?

1924
02:06:51,190 --> 02:06:53,410
Should I follow the roar?

1925
02:06:53,550 --> 02:06:54,810
But the roar bled me here.

1926
02:06:55,310 --> 02:06:57,950
Oh, this looks like a dirty, ugly, nasty room.

1927
02:06:58,690 --> 02:06:59,790
Probably with a secret.

1928
02:07:05,670 --> 02:07:07,770
I'm kind of a genius, you guys.

1929
02:07:08,450 --> 02:07:10,110
Don't ever doubt my genius.

1930
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:14,390
How did she know?

1931
02:07:22,340 --> 02:07:23,620
Lots of roar in here.

1932
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:25,120
Golly.

1933
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:28,900
Good thing we don't need to have to breathe.

1934
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:30,080
Ew!

1935
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:33,600
These guys are really nasty.

1936
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:36,340
Oh my god.

1937
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:39,560
Look at that form though.

1938
02:07:40,060 --> 02:07:42,420
Girl, we love a curvaceous mama.

1939
02:07:45,720 --> 02:07:46,580
That's me.

1940
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:49,600
You got a nice bod.

1941
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:55,440
Why is there so many heads out here?

1942
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:59,280
Why are there so many... Are we going to the underworld?

1943
02:08:01,060 --> 02:08:02,660
The underworld is... Oh no no.

1944
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:11,440
This might be the worst part ever.

1945
02:08:34,250 --> 02:08:35,050
Anyway.

1946
02:08:38,110 --> 02:08:39,350
Loot, please.

1947
02:08:42,610 --> 02:08:44,310
Classic bad underwater.

1948
02:08:45,070 --> 02:08:46,210
I still hear more.

1949
02:08:47,410 --> 02:08:48,470
Are more of them coming?

1950
02:08:48,770 --> 02:08:49,890
Let's just get out of here.

1951
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:56,070
Freedom!

1952
02:09:00,790 --> 02:09:03,670
We are now a rail shooter.

1953
02:09:04,230 --> 02:09:04,830
Congrats.

1954
02:09:08,150 --> 02:09:08,710
OK.

1955
02:09:09,530 --> 02:09:11,590
Why do I feel like I've seen this area before?

1956
02:09:15,030 --> 02:09:16,390
Oh, there is lighting.

1957
02:09:18,490 --> 02:09:19,050
No!

1958
02:09:19,050 --> 02:09:20,910
Why did I do that?

1959
02:09:21,470 --> 02:09:22,030
No!

1960
02:09:26,910 --> 02:09:30,430
I just made it terrible for myself.

1961
02:09:31,550 --> 02:09:33,630
Come on Dante, why are you so lazy?

1962
02:09:33,730 --> 02:09:34,930
You can't even just...

1963
02:09:34,930 --> 02:09:36,470
You can't just use your legs?

1964
02:09:36,550 --> 02:09:37,050
Come on.

1965
02:09:42,060 --> 02:09:43,520
Just run for it.

1966
02:09:44,180 --> 02:09:45,340
It's not that big of a deal.

1967
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:51,400
Oh man.

1968
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:53,580
Oh gosh.

1969
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:01,860
I knew I would have to.

1970
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:05,940
I knew I would have to, otherwise why would it be there?

1971
02:10:06,060 --> 02:10:09,020
But I just wanted to believe I didn't have to.

1972
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:15,660
Maybe like to here works?

1973
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:18,840
Oh yeah, there are doors here and stuff.

1974
02:10:20,940 --> 02:10:21,400
Nice.

1975
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:24,800
I think this is good, maybe for now.

1976
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:27,220
Because there is a door here.

1977
02:10:29,380 --> 02:10:30,120
Let's see.

1978
02:10:41,660 --> 02:10:42,820
Maybe up here?

1979
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:44,900
Do I have to go all the way to the top?

1980
02:10:49,170 --> 02:10:50,850
We are exploring everybody.

1981
02:10:52,230 --> 02:10:54,090
What do you want?

1982
02:10:55,190 --> 02:10:56,490
He says that way.

1983
02:10:58,810 --> 02:11:01,250
Thank you sir.

1984
02:11:03,330 --> 02:11:04,450
That way.

1985
02:11:05,330 --> 02:11:08,710
That way.

1986
02:11:12,670 --> 02:11:15,930
That way.

1987
02:11:16,890 --> 02:11:19,570
That way.

1988
02:11:19,570 --> 02:11:21,310
Just a tiny little bit.

1989
02:11:22,730 --> 02:11:24,230
Oh we got...

1990
02:11:24,230 --> 02:11:25,810
A thing.

1991
02:11:26,370 --> 02:11:27,870
Oh the philosopher's egg.

1992
02:11:28,390 --> 02:11:29,890
A material used in alchemy.

1993
02:11:31,210 --> 02:11:33,770
Not to be mistaken for the philosopher's stone.

1994
02:11:35,110 --> 02:11:36,290
Nobody likes that anymore.

1995
02:11:36,390 --> 02:11:37,210
Everybody goes for the egg.

1996
02:11:37,270 --> 02:11:38,190
What was the mission again?

1997
02:11:38,250 --> 02:11:40,990
I supposed to put this into the fire.

1998
02:11:43,550 --> 02:11:47,710
Wait, is that the fire that I saw in that door?

1999
02:11:47,710 --> 02:11:48,990
Wait, what's over here?

2000
02:11:53,190 --> 02:11:54,650
A whole lot of nothing.

2001
02:11:57,710 --> 02:11:58,470
Please, don't...

2002
02:11:59,390 --> 02:12:01,370
Wait, oh no.

2003
02:12:01,570 --> 02:12:02,550
Am I gonna have to swim again?

2004
02:12:04,030 --> 02:12:04,630
No Dante.

2005
02:12:05,370 --> 02:12:07,250
Dante, are you gonna have to swim again I think?

2006
02:12:08,070 --> 02:12:08,950
Oh ok, good, good, good.

2007
02:12:09,150 --> 02:12:13,170
Or wait, where was the door?

2008
02:12:14,070 --> 02:12:14,750
Egg!

2009
02:12:14,810 --> 02:12:16,550
Thanks for the first super chat!

2010
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:18,250
Thank you so much!

2011
02:12:18,570 --> 02:12:20,930
Egg, it's you the philosopher's...oh there it is.

2012
02:12:21,250 --> 02:12:22,450
The philosopher's egg.

2013
02:12:25,390 --> 02:12:26,530
Egg Mansion.

2014
02:12:29,170 --> 02:12:29,770
Alright.

2015
02:12:31,450 --> 02:12:32,590
There's the fire.

2016
02:12:34,810 --> 02:12:36,450
What else is around here?

2017
02:12:36,930 --> 02:12:38,850
This area looks mighty suspicious.

2018
02:12:40,910 --> 02:12:41,470
Oh no.

2019
02:12:42,710 --> 02:12:43,350
No.

2020
02:12:44,070 --> 02:12:47,830
No, wait.

2021
02:12:48,770 --> 02:12:49,690
No, please.

2022
02:12:52,250 --> 02:12:54,530
Also, don't mistake for philosopher's legacy.

2023
02:12:55,330 --> 02:12:56,510
So true.

2024
02:12:57,170 --> 02:12:57,850
No, nightmare!

2025
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:09,080
There's something engraved.

2026
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:12,100
Those who seek the truth shall put the egg in the basket.

2027
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:15,620
As a philosophy student I can confirm eggs are very important to us.

2028
02:13:16,360 --> 02:13:18,300
And shall warm it slowly with care.

2029
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:22,900
It will become a blue stone and the landmark to the rough roads.

2030
02:13:23,620 --> 02:13:23,960
Shall I?

2031
02:13:24,020 --> 02:13:24,280
Yes.

2032
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:27,100
It may take some time for it to transform.

2033
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:28,940
Oh god!

2034
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:35,680
Why!?

2035
02:13:44,550 --> 02:13:45,830
I don't have a devil trigger!

2036
02:13:46,150 --> 02:13:46,430
Please!

2037
02:13:47,010 --> 02:13:48,310
Please jump up on the back!

2038
02:13:48,610 --> 02:13:49,970
Get up on the Hydra's back!

2039
02:13:51,150 --> 02:13:51,870
Oh my god.

2040
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:52,830
Wait, am I going to hell?

2041
02:13:59,580 --> 02:14:00,460
Oh no!

2042
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:01,420
It's the Gryphon!

2043
02:14:04,740 --> 02:14:06,060
It's the Gryphon though.

2044
02:14:07,140 --> 02:14:08,540
I don't want to fight that guy.

2045
02:14:26,380 --> 02:14:28,980
I can't believe he sent the Gryphon to hell.

2046
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:29,620
That's crazy.

2047
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:31,580
Oh my gosh.

2048
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:36,360
I want to devil trigger.

2049
02:14:37,340 --> 02:14:39,700
It's kind of messed up that I can't!

2050
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:46,060
Get up on the Hydra's back!

2051
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:48,500
I'm going to corner you guys.

2052
02:14:50,700 --> 02:14:51,440
Oh, ouchie ouch.

2053
02:14:52,760 --> 02:14:53,280
Please.

2054
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:54,940
Please, can I attack you?

2055
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:55,980
Oh my god.

2056
02:14:57,880 --> 02:14:59,680
Oh, it's doing big damage though.

2057
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:01,020
Oh my god.

2058
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:03,900
Oh no!

2059
02:15:04,540 --> 02:15:07,220
Oh, ouchie ouch.

2060
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:08,780
OK, I can't dodge through here.

2061
02:15:09,800 --> 02:15:11,980
Like it appeared to be able to do.

2062
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:12,660
Oh gosh.

2063
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:17,080
Please.

2064
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:22,320
OK,

2065
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:27,720
cool.

2066
02:15:28,660 --> 02:15:31,820
That was a nice little break we had from the nightmare.

2067
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:32,400
Good job.

2068
02:15:35,250 --> 02:15:36,810
No DT, but big damage.

2069
02:15:39,010 --> 02:15:43,130
I wonder though if it would be better to DT...

2070
02:15:43,130 --> 02:15:44,990
With this... With the nightmare.

2071
02:15:45,650 --> 02:15:46,950
Like, you know the...

2072
02:15:54,430 --> 02:15:56,610
Oh wait, I gotta...

2073
02:16:06,030 --> 02:16:07,110
Oh my gosh.

2074
02:16:11,830 --> 02:16:13,890
God, he is absolutely destroying me.

2075
02:16:19,190 --> 02:16:19,610
Oh my god.

2076
02:16:20,010 --> 02:16:21,330
These things suck so bad.

2077
02:16:28,670 --> 02:16:29,870
Hey, ouchie ouchie ouch.

2078
02:16:30,110 --> 02:16:32,110
I'm not taking so much damage actually.

2079
02:16:33,070 --> 02:16:33,710
So...

2080
02:16:45,540 --> 02:16:49,840
Keeping nice and bright in here.

2081
02:16:51,620 --> 02:16:52,900
Big rorbs.

2082
02:16:53,480 --> 02:16:54,920
Transformation is complete.

2083
02:16:59,510 --> 02:17:01,970
We need to vomit, Ivo.

2084
02:17:02,310 --> 02:17:03,330
Why are you talking?

2085
02:17:03,690 --> 02:17:06,030
Why do we need to vomit, Ivo?

2086
02:17:06,730 --> 02:17:10,410
A strange voice from the transformed stone is echoing inside my head.

2087
02:17:11,590 --> 02:17:15,050
I am the first key to opening the gate of the underworld.

2088
02:17:15,810 --> 02:17:18,290
The second key resides in a mirror dimension.

2089
02:17:19,390 --> 02:17:20,770
Oh no, will everything be backwards?

2090
02:17:21,310 --> 02:17:21,750
Elixir.

2091
02:17:21,910 --> 02:17:26,130
It is the metamorphic form of the philosopher's legacy egg.

2092
02:17:26,730 --> 02:17:28,470
You can unseal the spells of the mirror.

2093
02:17:36,330 --> 02:17:36,830
Sorry.

2094
02:17:36,830 --> 02:17:37,770
Sorry.

2095
02:17:38,690 --> 02:17:39,610
Good night.

2096
02:17:39,810 --> 02:17:41,830
Fight nightmare a second time and prevail.

2097
02:17:42,270 --> 02:17:42,970
Oh, I did.

2098
02:17:44,190 --> 02:17:45,550
What's my score?

2099
02:17:46,190 --> 02:17:50,410
B for badass.

2100
02:17:56,470 --> 02:17:59,070
How many chapters were there?

2101
02:17:59,530 --> 02:18:02,630
26 or so?

2102
02:18:04,810 --> 02:18:06,350
How long have I been streaming for?

2103
02:18:06,490 --> 02:18:06,850
Hold on.

2104
02:18:06,990 --> 02:18:07,530
Oh, there we go.

2105
02:18:08,670 --> 02:18:09,110
23.

2106
02:18:10,670 --> 02:18:11,230
Oh shoot.

2107
02:18:11,490 --> 02:18:12,630
So we have 18?

2108
02:18:13,030 --> 02:18:13,470
19?

2109
02:18:13,790 --> 02:18:14,090
20?

2110
02:18:14,190 --> 02:18:14,430
21?

2111
02:18:14,510 --> 02:18:14,690
22?

2112
02:18:14,810 --> 02:18:15,030
23?

2113
02:18:15,150 --> 02:18:15,750
5 more!

2114
02:18:18,850 --> 02:18:19,530
Let's go.

2115
02:18:21,410 --> 02:18:23,190
Enter the corrupted world.

2116
02:18:23,390 --> 02:18:24,470
Open the gate to the underworld.

2117
02:18:24,470 --> 02:18:25,090
Oh yay!

2118
02:18:28,150 --> 02:18:32,650
I wish I could get some stuff for the sword though.

2119
02:18:34,710 --> 02:18:36,570
Wish I could get some stuff for the sword.

2120
02:18:38,350 --> 02:18:39,690
The last few were short?

2121
02:18:39,850 --> 02:18:40,290
Oh really?

2122
02:18:42,810 --> 02:18:46,450
Would you say I've already faced the toughest battles?

2123
02:18:46,970 --> 02:18:47,870
The toughest bosses?

2124
02:18:49,470 --> 02:18:52,970
Or do you think like the final boss will be really hard?

2125
02:18:53,170 --> 02:18:53,470
No?

2126
02:18:58,990 --> 02:19:00,510
Final boss is pretty hard too?

2127
02:19:00,710 --> 02:19:01,090
Oh god.

2128
02:19:01,630 --> 02:19:03,790
I figured it would be like that.

2129
02:19:06,950 --> 02:19:08,570
Final boss is gonna take you a few.

2130
02:19:08,770 --> 02:19:12,310
The end of the game is easily the worst bosses.

2131
02:19:14,810 --> 02:19:16,370
We got this guys.

2132
02:19:16,970 --> 02:19:17,950
I believe in us.

2133
02:19:18,250 --> 02:19:19,230
Is there anything else in here?

2134
02:19:19,810 --> 02:19:20,570
Anything exciting?

2135
02:19:21,910 --> 02:19:22,210
No?

2136
02:19:23,690 --> 02:19:26,050
What is this circle room for anyway?

2137
02:19:26,490 --> 02:19:30,430
We have all this fancy stuff.

2138
02:19:32,730 --> 02:19:34,630
I think I already jumped around here.

2139
02:19:35,310 --> 02:19:35,910
Yeah, ok.

2140
02:19:36,090 --> 02:19:36,670
Let's just go in.

2141
02:19:38,370 --> 02:19:39,230
There we go!

2142
02:19:44,300 --> 02:19:48,800
What would be the weapon you would use for the final boss?

2143
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:50,540
I know I'm not there yet, but I'm just curious.

2144
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:51,960
What would you say?

2145
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:57,940
So we are trying to open the door to the underworld?

2146
02:19:58,100 --> 02:19:58,680
Is that what we are doing?

2147
02:19:59,940 --> 02:20:00,960
Open the gate.

2148
02:20:03,060 --> 02:20:03,620
Sparda?

2149
02:20:04,260 --> 02:20:04,580
Ok.

2150
02:20:13,300 --> 02:20:14,660
Oh I think I need to go down here.

2151
02:20:20,260 --> 02:20:20,820
Sparda.

2152
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:25,960
There it is.

2153
02:20:26,280 --> 02:20:28,020
Or something related to it.

2154
02:20:29,880 --> 02:20:33,840
The elixir is responding strongly to the other painting.

2155
02:20:35,560 --> 02:20:36,520
Oh finally!

2156
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:39,100
I was curious what the other painting was.

2157
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:41,000
I'm glad they at least give you the option.

2158
02:20:46,030 --> 02:20:47,050
Oh, smileys.

2159
02:20:47,290 --> 02:20:48,030
I won't look.

2160
02:20:48,650 --> 02:20:50,630
I won't look with your smileys.

2161
02:20:51,530 --> 02:20:52,510
No spoilers guys.

2162
02:20:52,610 --> 02:20:53,190
No spoilers.

2163
02:20:54,410 --> 02:20:55,730
I know I asked questions, but...

2164
02:20:57,390 --> 02:20:58,350
Blur fragment.

2165
02:20:58,950 --> 02:21:00,290
And then also, what is this?

2166
02:21:03,370 --> 02:21:03,850
Untouchable!

2167
02:21:05,230 --> 02:21:05,930
Let's go.

2168
02:21:06,070 --> 02:21:06,390
Uh oh.

2169
02:21:06,570 --> 02:21:07,530
Why are they giving me these?

2170
02:21:10,150 --> 02:21:11,830
Why are you giving me these?

2171
02:21:13,310 --> 02:21:14,530
I have 3000.

2172
02:21:15,030 --> 02:21:15,790
It's not bad.

2173
02:21:17,390 --> 02:21:20,310
Maybe I should get some more holy water and stars and stuff.

2174
02:21:25,330 --> 02:21:26,690
People really can't help themselves.

2175
02:21:26,830 --> 02:21:27,130
It's ok.

2176
02:21:27,270 --> 02:21:30,450
I forgot to put a little thing in the chat that says no spoilers please.

2177
02:21:31,130 --> 02:21:33,350
Honestly, my fault.

2178
02:21:34,550 --> 02:21:35,270
It's alright.

2179
02:21:35,550 --> 02:21:36,190
It's all good though.

2180
02:21:40,090 --> 02:21:41,010
What's this way?

2181
02:21:42,990 --> 02:21:43,510
Nothing.

2182
02:21:44,370 --> 02:21:45,070
This way.

2183
02:21:45,470 --> 02:21:46,310
The doors vanished.

2184
02:21:46,450 --> 02:21:47,570
Oh, that's not a door anymore?

2185
02:21:47,890 --> 02:21:48,030
Ok.

2186
02:21:48,450 --> 02:21:48,970
Scary.

2187
02:21:50,270 --> 02:21:52,870
Wait, the doors vanished due to evil powers.

2188
02:21:53,430 --> 02:21:53,950
Scary.

2189
02:21:54,610 --> 02:21:57,870
And this is where we got that lady who was crying.

2190
02:21:58,990 --> 02:22:04,510
We bring into the studio this morning one of the spooking rights activists, Minto.

2191
02:22:05,070 --> 02:22:05,930
Should I call you Minto?

2192
02:22:06,110 --> 02:22:06,590
Made Minto.

2193
02:22:06,770 --> 02:22:07,630
Thank you for coming here.

2194
02:22:07,950 --> 02:22:08,190
What?

2195
02:22:09,330 --> 02:22:11,390
The doors vanished due to evil powers.

2196
02:22:12,130 --> 02:22:12,590
Spooky.

2197
02:22:12,890 --> 02:22:14,570
Wait, what am I doing here then?

2198
02:22:15,450 --> 02:22:16,610
I just teleported here?

2199
02:22:18,030 --> 02:22:19,590
Oh my gosh, camera please.

2200
02:22:24,840 --> 02:22:25,280
What?

2201
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:28,340
Spooky.

2202
02:22:30,500 --> 02:22:31,280
What is this?

2203
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:33,540
Oh, the mirror is responding to the elixir.

2204
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:35,940
And it's reflection is growing eerier.

2205
02:22:40,270 --> 02:22:40,710
Alright.

2206
02:22:40,990 --> 02:22:43,390
I forgot that that was a mirror because I couldn't see myself.

2207
02:22:44,690 --> 02:22:46,190
Oh, we are in the mirror dimension.

2208
02:22:48,150 --> 02:22:49,570
Oh, woah.

2209
02:22:50,930 --> 02:22:52,190
Oh, I didn't mean to...

2210
02:22:53,070 --> 02:22:53,910
Wait, hold on.

2211
02:22:54,230 --> 02:22:55,170
Let me look in there real quick.

2212
02:22:56,650 --> 02:22:58,790
You have not watched the Why Are You Giggling?

2213
02:22:59,050 --> 02:22:59,650
Oh, I did.

2214
02:22:59,930 --> 02:23:02,510
It's just you started that as if like...

2215
02:23:02,510 --> 02:23:06,190
As a bunch of other interviews start as.

2216
02:23:08,230 --> 02:23:09,190
Nightmare Beta.

2217
02:23:09,670 --> 02:23:11,230
A weapon formed in the underworld.

2218
02:23:13,170 --> 02:23:14,330
Collect all guns!

2219
02:23:14,410 --> 02:23:15,750
Oh my gosh, I got the achievement.

2220
02:23:16,630 --> 02:23:17,730
Here is the statue.

2221
02:23:17,850 --> 02:23:19,490
The Watcher of Time is just an illusion.

2222
02:23:19,850 --> 02:23:21,190
Orbs have no use here.

2223
02:23:23,310 --> 02:23:24,650
I got all the guns.

2224
02:23:32,510 --> 02:23:33,570
Can I use it?

2225
02:23:40,210 --> 02:23:41,090
Nightmare Beta.

2226
02:23:41,090 --> 02:23:41,150
Let's go.

2227
02:23:53,720 --> 02:23:56,760
What is this Metal Gear ass music right now?

2228
02:23:58,160 --> 02:23:59,660
Oh my god.

2229
02:23:59,880 --> 02:24:01,560
Oh guys, I think...

2230
02:24:01,560 --> 02:24:03,200
Oh, it's making me a little motion sick.

2231
02:24:03,320 --> 02:24:03,920
I'm not going to lie.

2232
02:24:05,340 --> 02:24:07,380
Oh, it's making me a little motion sickness.

2233
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:12,700
Philosopher's Stone.

2234
02:24:13,140 --> 02:24:14,040
It is the key.

2235
02:24:14,200 --> 02:24:16,160
Wait, there is an actual Philosopher's Stone?

2236
02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:17,560
Where is the legacy?

2237
02:24:19,640 --> 02:24:22,000
It is the key to unlocking the gate of the underworld.

2238
02:24:30,310 --> 02:24:30,670
Ew.

2239
02:24:34,950 --> 02:24:36,470
Where am I jumping at?

2240
02:24:39,890 --> 02:24:40,370
Ew!

2241
02:24:40,610 --> 02:24:41,270
What are you doing?

2242
02:24:43,130 --> 02:24:44,830
Oh my god, it's becoming Jojo.

2243
02:24:45,870 --> 02:24:47,010
They put on the mask.

2244
02:24:50,310 --> 02:24:51,570
What does this mean?

2245
02:24:53,470 --> 02:24:54,590
Now it can stand?

2246
02:24:54,950 --> 02:24:55,930
It's becoming human?

2247
02:24:56,670 --> 02:24:57,550
What is happening?

2248
02:24:58,870 --> 02:25:02,830
Ok, I'm just going to ignore that guy for a second and take care of this guy.

2249
02:25:03,210 --> 02:25:04,310
Holy moly!

2250
02:25:06,390 --> 02:25:06,870
I

2251
02:25:15,060 --> 02:25:15,760
got that guy though.

2252
02:25:15,800 --> 02:25:16,120
Hold on.

2253
02:25:16,280 --> 02:25:16,920
I want the...

2254
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:19,940
Yeah, give me...

2255
02:25:19,940 --> 02:25:21,460
I did?

2256
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:30,540
Oh, he's still... Oh, he's blowing up.

2257
02:25:33,540 --> 02:25:34,360
Oh, ok.

2258
02:25:40,530 --> 02:25:42,370
Wow, big money baby.

2259
02:25:43,270 --> 02:25:44,990
Can I leave here please?

2260
02:25:45,670 --> 02:25:46,950
Wait, where is the door?

2261
02:25:52,730 --> 02:25:54,310
Is this the door?

2262
02:25:55,010 --> 02:25:55,970
That's not the door.

2263
02:25:57,570 --> 02:25:58,810
Is this the door?

2264
02:26:00,330 --> 02:26:01,430
Where is the door?

2265
02:26:01,470 --> 02:26:02,050
Is this the door?

2266
02:26:02,610 --> 02:26:03,610
Is this the door?

2267
02:26:04,270 --> 02:26:04,910
Where is the door?

2268
02:26:05,030 --> 02:26:05,430
Oh, up?

2269
02:26:05,630 --> 02:26:05,770
Ok.

2270
02:26:06,690 --> 02:26:09,230
Oh my goodness, I can't see anything.

2271
02:26:16,270 --> 02:26:19,030
Ok, that's kind of an awesome shot though.

2272
02:26:21,690 --> 02:26:22,170
Oh,

2273
02:26:30,710 --> 02:26:31,330
up more.

2274
02:26:33,050 --> 02:26:33,530
Blorb!

2275
02:26:34,150 --> 02:26:35,690
No, we have to go back!

2276
02:26:40,670 --> 02:26:41,530
We have to go back!

2277
02:26:42,570 --> 02:26:44,830
We must grab the blorb.

2278
02:26:45,450 --> 02:26:46,150
Is it worth it?

2279
02:26:46,250 --> 02:26:46,970
Absolutely!

2280
02:26:48,710 --> 02:26:49,430
100%.

2281
02:27:04,920 --> 02:27:06,360
Maybe I...

2282
02:27:06,360 --> 02:27:10,220
Do I go up on this guy in the middle here?

2283
02:27:14,830 --> 02:27:16,730
You need air raid to get this one.

2284
02:27:17,350 --> 02:27:17,990
Oh, well.

2285
02:27:18,990 --> 02:27:19,930
I can just switch, right?

2286
02:27:25,110 --> 02:27:25,870
What's my thing?

2287
02:27:25,990 --> 02:27:27,210
Oh, what's my...

2288
02:27:27,210 --> 02:27:27,490
Yeah!

2289
02:27:27,950 --> 02:27:29,230
Oh wait, is that empty?

2290
02:27:35,210 --> 02:27:36,970
You were never able to get it?

2291
02:27:37,090 --> 02:27:40,910
Oh, you've never met someone as stubborn as a mint fronto.

2292
02:27:43,270 --> 02:27:45,030
When I want something...

2293
02:27:45,950 --> 02:27:47,130
I get it.

2294
02:27:53,320 --> 02:27:55,060
Sorry if this world is making you...

2295
02:27:55,060 --> 02:27:56,920
It's actually not so bad up here.

2296
02:27:57,940 --> 02:28:00,620
But in that little courtyard, it makes me super woozy.

2297
02:28:07,640 --> 02:28:08,680
Alright, let's see.

2298
02:28:12,440 --> 02:28:16,320
Also, it's like floating.

2299
02:28:17,460 --> 02:28:20,800
Oh gosh, standing still also makes me really woozy.

2300
02:28:22,920 --> 02:28:26,640
I don't want to use my devil star for this, you know?

2301
02:28:27,300 --> 02:28:28,360
Not for the blorb.

2302
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:34,360
If I have to use air raid, maybe it's not worth it then.

2303
02:28:38,390 --> 02:28:40,090
Yeah, maybe it's not worth it.

2304
02:28:40,730 --> 02:28:42,590
But it's like a blorb fragment too.

2305
02:28:46,090 --> 02:28:50,050
Blorb is the best reason to use one, but it's probably a blorb fragment.

2306
02:28:58,090 --> 02:29:00,150
I'm stubborn, but I'm also frugal.

2307
02:29:01,470 --> 02:29:03,650
What if I like...

2308
02:29:08,920 --> 02:29:10,420
Have four D-stars?

2309
02:29:10,620 --> 02:29:12,900
Yeah, I could need all of them for...

2310
02:29:14,340 --> 02:29:15,920
For the final fight.

2311
02:29:16,940 --> 02:29:20,000
And I only have two out of four blorbs.

2312
02:29:23,440 --> 02:29:24,820
You will not use them?

2313
02:29:30,160 --> 02:29:31,920
There is no way else?

2314
02:29:44,460 --> 02:29:46,440
Come on Dante, just reach up.

2315
02:29:47,080 --> 02:29:48,780
Reach up with your arms, Dante.

2316
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:54,200
I'm trying to get up on the tower.

2317
02:29:56,400 --> 02:29:57,160
Trust us Minto?

2318
02:29:57,340 --> 02:29:58,340
What am I trusting you with?

2319
02:29:59,740 --> 02:30:01,000
With my afterlife?

2320
02:30:01,320 --> 02:30:02,300
I don't know about that.

2321
02:30:04,860 --> 02:30:07,060
Dante does have a ledge grasp.

2322
02:30:07,900 --> 02:30:08,840
I know he does.

2323
02:30:10,560 --> 02:30:11,580
Oh my god.

2324
02:30:13,060 --> 02:30:14,820
Guys, this is the final boss.

2325
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:21,340
Gotta use the star.

2326
02:30:39,700 --> 02:30:41,020
I'm too tall!

2327
02:31:04,510 --> 02:31:05,950
Now I'm angry.

2328
02:31:07,670 --> 02:31:09,230
Now I'm angry.

2329
02:31:20,330 --> 02:31:21,630
Let me leave!

2330
02:31:23,630 --> 02:31:26,310
The final boss with Minto's depth perception.

2331
02:31:26,510 --> 02:31:27,290
Can you blame me?

2332
02:31:28,370 --> 02:31:30,130
This world is whack!

2333
02:31:30,550 --> 02:31:32,430
Wait, where the hell is the door anyway?

2334
02:31:33,910 --> 02:31:36,330
This world is whack, absolutely.

2335
02:31:36,330 --> 02:31:38,650
Where is the door?

2336
02:31:38,890 --> 02:31:39,830
I'm gonna throw up.

2337
02:31:39,950 --> 02:31:41,010
Oh god, please.

2338
02:32:00,440 --> 02:32:01,820
Same way you came in.

2339
02:32:01,900 --> 02:32:03,240
I don't remember where that was.

2340
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:06,500
Is it over there?

2341
02:32:06,680 --> 02:32:07,280
Oh, I see it!

2342
02:32:10,620 --> 02:32:11,960
How do I get up there?

2343
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:14,520
Oh my god, oh my god.

2344
02:32:14,600 --> 02:32:15,080
Hold on.

2345
02:32:27,430 --> 02:32:29,150
Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up, you guys.

2346
02:32:29,210 --> 02:32:29,570
Hold on.

2347
02:32:57,500 --> 02:33:00,540
Okay, I see where the door is, but I just gotta get through it.

2348
02:33:02,940 --> 02:33:03,700
Oh, please.

2349
02:33:06,800 --> 02:33:07,820
How do I get up there?

2350
02:33:20,030 --> 02:33:22,170
There's a hole you fell down to get to the door.

2351
02:33:22,990 --> 02:33:23,710
Oh, oh!

2352
02:33:23,850 --> 02:33:24,290
Okay, okay.

2353
02:33:24,650 --> 02:33:26,530
I thought that hole would bring me all the way to the bottom.

2354
02:33:26,750 --> 02:33:27,350
Okay, thank you.

2355
02:33:31,100 --> 02:33:34,680
I'm like squinting so I don't see the screen.

2356
02:33:38,360 --> 02:33:39,000
Okay.

2357
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:39,940
Oops.

2358
02:33:41,180 --> 02:33:42,320
Oh, sorry Blorb.

2359
02:33:43,060 --> 02:33:43,820
Not today.

2360
02:33:44,840 --> 02:33:45,620
Oh gosh.

2361
02:33:55,740 --> 02:33:59,180
Hold on, I'm gonna go get some more water.

2362
02:34:00,400 --> 02:34:01,300
And maybe throw up.

2363
02:34:03,040 --> 02:34:04,440
I'll be right back.

2364
02:34:05,200 --> 02:34:05,680
Hold on.

2365
02:38:12,200 --> 02:38:13,760
Sorry about that.

2366
02:38:14,280 --> 02:38:14,900
I'm okay.

2367
02:38:15,700 --> 02:38:16,740
I'm okay.

2368
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:18,180
I didn't throw up.

2369
02:38:18,780 --> 02:38:19,900
I ate some chips.

2370
02:38:21,320 --> 02:38:22,160
I'm okay.

2371
02:38:23,800 --> 02:38:25,040
I'm okay.

2372
02:38:25,940 --> 02:38:27,100
Oh my goodness.

2373
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:33,100
I was like... I was like, am I gonna...

2374
02:38:34,200 --> 02:38:35,220
Am I gonna throw up?

2375
02:38:35,720 --> 02:38:36,840
But I didn't.

2376
02:38:39,160 --> 02:38:39,640
Okay.

2377
02:38:40,720 --> 02:38:41,300
See ya.

2378
02:38:42,720 --> 02:38:44,060
Stupid mirror world.

2379
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:45,300
I never want to go back ever.

2380
02:38:46,900 --> 02:38:48,180
How much have you eaten today?

2381
02:38:48,360 --> 02:38:49,780
I've eaten five.

2382
02:38:52,900 --> 02:38:54,860
Wait, where do I go with this?

2383
02:38:57,100 --> 02:39:00,600
With my philosopher's stone.

2384
02:39:02,280 --> 02:39:04,420
It just says open the gate.

2385
02:39:04,680 --> 02:39:06,100
Okay, well...

2386
02:39:06,640 --> 02:39:08,280
Go across the bridge.

2387
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:10,500
Back here?

2388
02:39:11,640 --> 02:39:12,380
Oh man.

2389
02:39:21,720 --> 02:39:24,560
I forget that it doesn't kill you.

2390
02:39:24,560 --> 02:39:26,900
Why is my thing shaking though?

2391
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:28,080
Are we okay?

2392
02:39:28,400 --> 02:39:28,780
Oh no.

2393
02:39:30,540 --> 02:39:31,000
Wait.

2394
02:39:32,320 --> 02:39:33,060
What's this?

2395
02:39:41,040 --> 02:39:41,680
Okay.

2396
02:39:46,360 --> 02:39:47,840
Who's coming for me next?

2397
02:39:48,160 --> 02:39:48,780
You two?

2398
02:39:50,200 --> 02:39:51,420
Little skellies.

2399
02:39:51,800 --> 02:39:53,060
You think you're so spooky?

2400
02:39:53,520 --> 02:39:55,560
You think you're so creepy scary?

2401
02:40:00,420 --> 02:40:01,420
Skull issue?

2402
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:05,780
Whatever works, works you guys.

2403
02:40:07,180 --> 02:40:08,740
I think that works better.

2404
02:40:10,820 --> 02:40:13,700
Surge of evil is reacting to the power of the elixir.

2405
02:40:13,960 --> 02:40:14,400
No, no.

2406
02:40:15,620 --> 02:40:16,820
No, no, god no.

2407
02:40:17,220 --> 02:40:18,700
It's starting to activate.

2408
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:20,900
Wait, what do you mean by that?

2409
02:40:21,100 --> 02:40:21,540
No.

2410
02:40:22,780 --> 02:40:23,300
No.

2411
02:40:29,280 --> 02:40:29,720
No.

2412
02:40:38,980 --> 02:40:39,420
Okay.

2413
02:40:45,040 --> 02:40:46,500
His powers are unknown.

2414
02:40:46,620 --> 02:40:50,600
Does this use my devil trigger as a thing?

2415
02:40:51,160 --> 02:40:52,780
Maybe I should go back to my grenade launcher.

2416
02:40:53,500 --> 02:40:54,280
Yes, okay.

2417
02:40:54,500 --> 02:40:55,720
I'm gonna go back to my grenade launcher.

2418
02:40:55,860 --> 02:40:58,340
I don't use it so much with this guy, but...

2419
02:40:59,700 --> 02:41:00,300
Oh.

2420
02:41:07,100 --> 02:41:08,540
No, no, no.

2421
02:41:09,660 --> 02:41:11,480
No guys, I can't do this.

2422
02:41:19,940 --> 02:41:22,100
It's so wobbly, you guys.

2423
02:41:22,180 --> 02:41:24,080
I don't think I can...

2424
02:41:24,080 --> 02:41:29,080
I've never gotten so motion sick from a game that wasn't VR.

2425
02:41:30,240 --> 02:41:31,040
Oh my god.

2426
02:41:41,090 --> 02:41:42,210
It's just for one area?

2427
02:41:42,410 --> 02:41:42,830
Okay.

2428
02:41:45,170 --> 02:41:45,890
Okay.

2429
02:41:46,950 --> 02:41:47,610
Okay.

2430
02:41:51,310 --> 02:41:52,650
I'm just gonna run.

2431
02:41:53,950 --> 02:41:55,750
Oh wait, where am I?

2432
02:41:57,590 --> 02:41:59,810
Wait, did I... I think I'm trapped.

2433
02:42:00,610 --> 02:42:01,050
Wait.

2434
02:42:02,630 --> 02:42:03,350
Wait.

2435
02:42:05,250 --> 02:42:05,970
Wait.

2436
02:42:06,330 --> 02:42:07,270
Let me out, please.

2437
02:42:08,170 --> 02:42:09,370
Let me out.

2438
02:42:13,370 --> 02:42:14,650
My hair is stuck.

2439
02:42:16,230 --> 02:42:16,910
Oh there!

2440
02:42:17,170 --> 02:42:18,550
Dante, oh my god, thank goodness.

2441
02:42:19,090 --> 02:42:19,670
What is this?

2442
02:42:26,290 --> 02:42:28,150
Oh wait, I think I put the thing in here, right?

2443
02:42:28,250 --> 02:42:31,370
The evil darkness is whirling with its mouth open.

2444
02:42:33,670 --> 02:42:35,510
This must be the gate of the underworld.

2445
02:42:36,470 --> 02:42:36,890
Exciting.

2446
02:42:37,510 --> 02:42:37,810
Shall I?

2447
02:42:37,830 --> 02:42:39,470
Yes, use the philosopher's stone, please.

2448
02:42:41,490 --> 02:42:42,650
Okay, okay.

2449
02:42:42,910 --> 02:42:44,550
I thought I had to fight anything.

2450
02:42:45,470 --> 02:42:48,830
We opened the gate!

2451
02:42:49,810 --> 02:42:50,990
Hi, cool Dante.

2452
02:42:53,010 --> 02:42:53,870
A bee!

2453
02:42:57,230 --> 02:42:58,950
Oh, thank goodness.

2454
02:43:00,450 --> 02:43:02,670
Wow, we have 4,300.

2455
02:43:04,350 --> 02:43:05,550
We're killing it, you guys.

2456
02:43:06,550 --> 02:43:09,030
Bee for barf, for real.

2457
02:43:10,390 --> 02:43:12,650
Bee for barf!

2458
02:43:16,220 --> 02:43:19,610
Mission 20, showdown with nightmare.

2459
02:43:20,290 --> 02:43:20,490
No!

2460
02:43:22,170 --> 02:43:24,550
Head to the place of sacrifice.

2461
02:43:25,430 --> 02:43:28,850
Where are you, nightmare?

2462
02:43:29,290 --> 02:43:31,450
Wow, we're in the underworld, you guys.

2463
02:43:32,090 --> 02:43:33,110
Exciting.

2464
02:43:37,770 --> 02:43:38,450
Okay.

2465
02:43:38,730 --> 02:43:40,510
Wow, it's all pulsing.

2466
02:43:43,730 --> 02:43:44,410
Wait.

2467
02:43:45,710 --> 02:43:46,830
Okay, nevermind.

2468
02:43:47,710 --> 02:43:48,990
Whose flesh is this?

2469
02:43:51,930 --> 02:43:53,630
I think I'm going to get YouTube banned.

2470
02:43:54,530 --> 02:43:55,390
Oh my god!

2471
02:43:55,450 --> 02:43:55,950
What's in here?

2472
02:43:56,530 --> 02:43:57,030
Oh shit.

2473
02:43:57,630 --> 02:43:59,550
I can change to...

2474
02:44:01,590 --> 02:44:02,270
You.

2475
02:44:02,270 --> 02:44:02,470
You.

2476
02:44:03,750 --> 02:44:05,650
Why is an ice creature in hell?

2477
02:44:07,430 --> 02:44:08,570
Oh my god.

2478
02:44:31,380 --> 02:44:31,860
Nice.

2479
02:44:32,860 --> 02:44:33,400
D'oh!

2480
02:44:33,520 --> 02:44:34,300
What do you mean, d'oh?

2481
02:44:36,440 --> 02:44:38,620
Oh my gosh, the statue is here.

2482
02:44:39,820 --> 02:44:41,680
Hell is not only fire.

2483
02:44:44,360 --> 02:44:45,980
In my brain it is.

2484
02:44:48,860 --> 02:44:49,400
Sparda.

2485
02:44:54,260 --> 02:44:55,900
Should we buy anything?

2486
02:44:56,040 --> 02:44:59,340
I didn't buy anything just when coming in here, but...

2487
02:44:59,340 --> 02:45:00,420
We have a lot of money.

2488
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:04,960
Well, actually, in Dante's Inferno, the deepest circle of hell is cold mint.

2489
02:45:05,300 --> 02:45:08,200
Oh god, it's like you don't read classic Italian poetry.

2490
02:45:09,700 --> 02:45:10,900
Oh my god.

2491
02:45:12,060 --> 02:45:13,840
Why would you say that, VTuber?

2492
02:45:13,840 --> 02:45:15,720
You ill...

2493
02:45:15,720 --> 02:45:17,720
Oh my god, it's disgusting.

2494
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:21,800
You illiterate, unrefined creature.

2495
02:45:22,080 --> 02:45:24,840
You can't even read the classic...

2496
02:45:27,060 --> 02:45:28,600
Like Dante's Inferno.

2497
02:45:28,700 --> 02:45:30,340
Oh my gosh, look at the bodies even.

2498
02:45:36,660 --> 02:45:37,260
Cutscene.

2499
02:45:45,680 --> 02:45:46,400
Oh...

2500
02:45:47,280 --> 02:45:48,300
What's your name?

2501
02:45:48,380 --> 02:45:48,680
Tina!

2502
02:45:49,460 --> 02:45:50,180
Trish!

2503
02:45:55,900 --> 02:45:58,720
Oh no, I see the lights on the ground.

2504
02:46:01,540 --> 02:46:03,340
Oh my god.

2505
02:46:04,680 --> 02:46:07,520
The final showdown with the nightmare.

2506
02:46:07,520 --> 02:46:07,720
Nightmare.

2507
02:46:12,800 --> 02:46:14,260
Oh, she's behind...

2508
02:46:14,260 --> 02:46:16,060
I wish I could too.

2509
02:46:16,940 --> 02:46:18,220
Okay, shoot.

2510
02:46:23,530 --> 02:46:24,110
Please.

2511
02:46:25,470 --> 02:46:25,830
Oh my god.

2512
02:46:29,480 --> 02:46:30,360
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

2513
02:46:30,980 --> 02:46:31,780
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

2514
02:46:32,220 --> 02:46:35,700
Oh my gosh, please, let me move!

2515
02:46:39,180 --> 02:46:39,440
No!

2516
02:46:40,420 --> 02:46:42,240
I have like barely two seconds.

2517
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:44,260
Oh, the light went out already?

2518
02:46:44,660 --> 02:46:45,420
So fast.

2519
02:46:46,840 --> 02:46:47,820
Wait, what happened?

2520
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:48,280
Ouch!

2521
02:47:03,070 --> 02:47:03,340
Roar!

2522
02:47:03,740 --> 02:47:04,320
Be a morb!

2523
02:47:05,120 --> 02:47:05,660
Roar!

2524
02:47:05,860 --> 02:47:06,780
Oh my god.

2525
02:47:07,420 --> 02:47:08,980
Guys, this isn't looking so hot.

2526
02:47:09,940 --> 02:47:11,560
I don't think this is...

2527
02:47:11,560 --> 02:47:13,740
I don't think this is looking so hot!

2528
02:47:16,900 --> 02:47:19,200
Dante, don't save her, you'll become a simp.

2529
02:47:21,020 --> 02:47:21,560
Oh

2530
02:47:26,290 --> 02:47:26,970
my gosh!

2531
02:47:26,970 --> 02:47:27,070
Oh my gosh!

2532
02:47:27,890 --> 02:47:28,730
No, please!

2533
02:47:34,200 --> 02:47:36,340
Get the lights, get the lights before it can melt.

2534
02:47:36,820 --> 02:47:37,060
Okay.

2535
02:47:39,680 --> 02:47:40,680
Please, open up!

2536
02:47:41,720 --> 02:47:42,020
Oh

2537
02:47:45,980 --> 02:47:47,120
my god, oh my gosh, Dante.

2538
02:47:49,860 --> 02:47:51,500
I think I might have to switch.

2539
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:55,300
I might have to switch, I think.

2540
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:08,580
Alistair is better since he can use E.T.

2541
02:48:08,640 --> 02:48:09,360
I think so.

2542
02:48:09,740 --> 02:48:12,380
I was thinking that I could use the air raid.

2543
02:48:12,380 --> 02:48:14,060
At least.

2544
02:48:14,360 --> 02:48:15,060
Oh my gosh.

2545
02:48:18,160 --> 02:48:19,620
But I have none.

2546
02:48:23,620 --> 02:48:24,980
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2547
02:48:26,360 --> 02:48:26,920
I'm

2548
02:48:31,940 --> 02:48:32,240
gonna...

2549
02:48:32,240 --> 02:48:32,700
I died.

2550
02:48:32,940 --> 02:48:34,300
I was gonna say, I'm gonna die!

2551
02:48:34,740 --> 02:48:35,260
I died.

2552
02:48:42,380 --> 02:48:43,240
Yes, please.

2553
02:48:48,040 --> 02:48:48,600
Okay.

2554
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:50,960
Oh, icky.

2555
02:48:51,300 --> 02:48:53,040
I hate this guy so much.

2556
02:48:54,060 --> 02:48:55,140
Holy cow.

2557
02:48:55,460 --> 02:48:57,040
Okay, let's switch to...

2558
02:48:58,820 --> 02:48:59,900
different for now.

2559
02:49:00,020 --> 02:49:02,720
Since we know we're gonna get those guys coming up here.

2560
02:49:06,600 --> 02:49:08,360
Camera is really bad in this room.

2561
02:49:09,260 --> 02:49:09,480
Yeah.

2562
02:49:19,340 --> 02:49:20,040
Ouchy, ouch.

2563
02:49:21,260 --> 02:49:22,240
Oh, oh.

2564
02:49:33,080 --> 02:49:34,060
Got him, baby.

2565
02:49:34,680 --> 02:49:37,320
From what I recall, Nightmare is weak to the Nightmare Beta gun.

2566
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:40,260
It has been a while and I never defeated it.

2567
02:49:40,340 --> 02:49:40,540
What?

2568
02:49:40,960 --> 02:49:41,840
What do you mean?

2569
02:49:42,020 --> 02:49:43,900
You mean like you never beat the game?

2570
02:49:45,080 --> 02:49:46,300
Nightmare resists the gun.

2571
02:49:46,420 --> 02:49:46,620
Oh.

2572
02:49:47,920 --> 02:49:49,620
Wait, which is it?

2573
02:49:50,300 --> 02:49:51,920
You got this basil phantom.

2574
02:49:52,220 --> 02:49:53,520
That's not my name!

2575
02:49:57,020 --> 02:49:58,260
Nightmare Beta sucks?

2576
02:49:58,260 --> 02:49:58,600
Oh.

2577
02:50:02,840 --> 02:50:06,200
I'm a star!

2578
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,260
Okay, we're at full Devil Trigger, so...

2579
02:50:12,360 --> 02:50:13,220
Maybe this will be okay.

2580
02:50:13,320 --> 02:50:14,360
Oh, I meant to save.

2581
02:50:14,480 --> 02:50:14,820
Dang it.

2582
02:50:18,580 --> 02:50:19,480
I'll save now.

2583
02:50:21,560 --> 02:50:22,820
Ice Demon in Hell?

2584
02:50:24,300 --> 02:50:27,220
Actual Dante describes Elastric Flotel as a permanently frozen lake.

2585
02:50:27,300 --> 02:50:29,600
I'm gonna get, I'm gonna get um, actually with this, huh?

2586
02:50:31,520 --> 02:50:32,200
Come on!

2587
02:50:32,380 --> 02:50:32,820
Come on!

2588
02:50:33,020 --> 02:50:33,620
There we go.

2589
02:50:34,700 --> 02:50:35,180
And...

2590
02:50:52,290 --> 02:50:53,230
I can't see anything!

2591
02:50:54,150 --> 02:50:54,630
Please!

2592
02:50:55,450 --> 02:50:57,750
Oh shoot, I forgot about the lights!

2593
02:50:58,150 --> 02:50:59,150
One, two, hi!

2594
02:51:00,390 --> 02:51:00,790
I'll

2595
02:51:24,240 --> 02:51:25,540
turn around, Dante, please!

2596
02:51:29,300 --> 02:51:30,160
Holy cow.

2597
02:51:30,160 --> 02:51:32,680
This sucks

2598
02:51:47,480 --> 02:51:48,120
so bad.

2599
02:51:58,770 --> 02:52:00,070
Wait, did we get him?

2600
02:52:04,150 --> 02:52:05,370
What's going on?

2601
02:52:07,330 --> 02:52:08,110
Trish!

2602
02:52:12,430 --> 02:52:12,850
What?

2603
02:52:22,470 --> 02:52:23,230
But you're hot!

2604
02:52:29,610 --> 02:52:31,110
Wait, what do you mean by that?

2605
02:52:31,170 --> 02:52:32,650
Oh my god, are you kidding me?

2606
02:52:33,190 --> 02:52:34,550
No, no way.

2607
02:52:35,150 --> 02:52:36,610
No, no, no, god!

2608
02:52:37,570 --> 02:52:40,390
Oh my god, I'm gonna die here, I'm gonna die here, I'm gonna die here!

2609
02:52:40,390 --> 02:52:41,790
Please, please, please!

2610
02:52:42,170 --> 02:52:44,490
Oh my god, oh my god, no way.

2611
02:52:45,150 --> 02:52:46,270
Trish, you bitch!

2612
02:52:55,570 --> 02:52:57,690
Dante, do anything, please!

2613
02:53:26,430 --> 02:53:29,330
I'm trying to decide what items I wanna use.

2614
02:53:32,470 --> 02:53:36,270
If I Holy Water, even if his little thing's not out...

2615
02:53:44,960 --> 02:53:47,600
Holy Water only if Orb is out, I don't know if it's out.

2616
02:53:48,980 --> 02:53:51,060
I think it would be better to Devil Star.

2617
02:53:55,180 --> 02:53:55,620
Oh shoot.

2618
02:54:23,650 --> 02:54:24,390
Why?

2619
02:54:30,680 --> 02:54:33,060
Why did he regain life?

2620
02:54:34,120 --> 02:54:38,880
Why did he regain life?

2621
02:54:40,880 --> 02:54:41,620
What?

2622
02:54:43,200 --> 02:54:45,480
That's so messed up!

2623
02:55:01,130 --> 02:55:01,690
Bitch!

2624
02:55:07,320 --> 02:55:08,380
Actually, hold on.

2625
02:55:10,360 --> 02:55:12,240
I will buy some health stuff.

2626
02:55:16,960 --> 02:55:20,160
I guess I'll buy another Devil Star since I have to use it.

2627
02:55:21,340 --> 02:55:22,460
Oh man!

2628
02:55:25,420 --> 02:55:27,080
I always untouchable that last bit.

2629
02:55:27,160 --> 02:55:29,980
I think I should, I think I should, honestly.

2630
02:55:30,320 --> 02:55:32,300
I thought about it, I thought about using it.

2631
02:55:39,650 --> 02:55:42,110
I don't know if I should Blorb or Plorb.

2632
02:55:42,530 --> 02:55:43,970
Plorb, plorb, plorb, plorb.

2633
02:55:44,970 --> 02:55:47,010
Plorb, plorb, plorb, plorb.

2634
02:55:53,300 --> 02:55:54,700
Plorb?

2635
02:55:54,900 --> 02:55:55,420
Plorb.

2636
02:55:57,200 --> 02:55:58,640
It's hard to say.

2637
02:56:01,380 --> 02:56:02,080
Plorb?

2638
02:56:08,710 --> 02:56:09,770
Plorb it is.

2639
02:56:15,710 --> 02:56:18,130
Nightmare and Trish.

2640
02:56:18,550 --> 02:56:19,310
Trish.

2641
02:56:20,150 --> 02:56:21,550
Trish!

2642
02:56:26,060 --> 02:56:27,660
Evil, evil, evil.

2643
02:56:28,760 --> 02:56:31,120
What an evil fight, actually.

2644
02:56:33,040 --> 02:56:34,360
Oh my god.

2645
02:56:41,240 --> 02:56:43,020
Oh wait, I'm not even using it.

2646
02:56:43,020 --> 02:56:43,720
I'm such an idiot.

2647
02:56:43,920 --> 02:56:45,200
I was like, why am I...

2648
02:57:02,230 --> 02:57:02,710
700.

2649
02:57:09,830 --> 02:57:12,110
I didn't mean to buy the Devil Star.

2650
02:57:14,770 --> 02:57:18,430
I didn't mean to buy the Devil Star, but now we have 5 of them.

2651
02:57:22,770 --> 02:57:23,330
Oopsie!

2652
02:57:35,030 --> 02:57:38,390
Ok, the other way is over here.

2653
02:57:40,890 --> 02:57:43,810
Let's change our weapon, back to Alistar.

2654
02:57:54,800 --> 02:57:55,320
No!

2655
02:57:55,440 --> 02:57:55,880
Stop, stop!

2656
02:57:55,960 --> 02:57:56,680
Turn around, please!

2657
02:57:57,020 --> 02:57:58,600
Stop, stop, stop!

2658
02:57:58,980 --> 02:57:59,980
Please, Dante!

2659
02:58:00,660 --> 02:58:03,020
Dante, hit this instead, you dummy!

2660
02:58:29,820 --> 02:58:30,980
He... I hate Dante.

2661
02:58:31,200 --> 02:58:32,380
I hate this auto-lock.

2662
02:58:32,740 --> 02:58:35,500
The auto-lock sometimes is the worst thing ever.

2663
02:58:35,500 --> 02:58:38,820
It might actually be the least best thing ever.

2664
02:58:39,220 --> 02:58:40,000
It's so awful.

2665
02:58:41,280 --> 02:58:42,140
Please, Dante.

2666
02:58:42,560 --> 02:58:43,320
Dante, Dante!

2667
02:58:51,070 --> 02:58:52,230
Where is it?

2668
02:58:52,470 --> 02:58:52,690
No!

2669
02:58:59,850 --> 02:59:00,330
Please.

2670
02:59:03,320 --> 02:59:04,800
Oh, I wasted it.

2671
02:59:05,640 --> 02:59:06,480
Oh my gosh.

2672
02:59:06,980 --> 02:59:07,280
No!

2673
02:59:08,360 --> 02:59:09,880
Guys, this is not the run.

2674
02:59:09,980 --> 02:59:11,220
This is so not the run.

2675
02:59:11,340 --> 02:59:12,040
Oh my god.

2676
02:59:12,280 --> 02:59:13,060
What the hell?

2677
02:59:13,180 --> 02:59:13,520
Oh my god.

2678
02:59:13,840 --> 02:59:14,660
Stay away from me!

2679
02:59:43,240 --> 02:59:44,340
I think I should.

2680
03:00:01,100 --> 03:00:03,040
Don't absorb your orb!

2681
03:00:03,680 --> 03:00:05,140
Release your orb!

2682
03:00:06,180 --> 03:00:06,780
For me!

2683
03:00:10,170 --> 03:00:11,070
Oh shoot.

2684
03:00:11,290 --> 03:00:12,690
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

2685
03:00:12,790 --> 03:00:15,210
I think I'm... I think I'm in hell.

2686
03:00:26,200 --> 03:00:27,700
How much of...

2687
03:00:32,220 --> 03:00:33,160
That's fine.

2688
03:00:34,300 --> 03:00:35,960
That's fine, I guess.

2689
03:00:37,720 --> 03:00:39,740
Why do the lights have to go out though?

2690
03:00:41,060 --> 03:00:43,420
I always forget the lights go out in that moment.

2691
03:00:46,800 --> 03:00:49,140
Wait, who am I about to fight in here?

2692
03:00:49,560 --> 03:00:53,360
Wait, what boss am I about to fight in here?

2693
03:00:54,720 --> 03:00:55,520
Oh gosh.

2694
03:00:56,960 --> 03:01:01,390
I guess I'm getting like my devil trigger.

2695
03:01:02,330 --> 03:01:02,810
No!

2696
03:01:03,490 --> 03:01:04,670
No, no, no!

2697
03:01:09,370 --> 03:01:10,770
I had a feeling.

2698
03:01:11,190 --> 03:01:11,930
I had a feeling.

2699
03:01:12,230 --> 03:01:13,750
I had a feeling it was going to be...

2700
03:01:14,490 --> 03:01:15,330
Oh shit.

2701
03:01:16,490 --> 03:01:18,190
Wait, this doesn't work on him.

2702
03:01:18,290 --> 03:01:18,690
Never mind.

2703
03:01:23,200 --> 03:01:24,800
Sorry, I forgot about the quick change.

2704
03:01:33,510 --> 03:01:34,810
Wait, why did I do that?

2705
03:01:35,470 --> 03:01:37,030
I'm... You guys, I'm such a...

2706
03:01:41,650 --> 03:01:42,090
I

2707
03:01:46,630 --> 03:01:47,010
am here.

2708
03:01:47,270 --> 03:01:49,010
It's because of this fucking guy!

2709
03:02:06,980 --> 03:02:09,240
If I reload, do I get to keep all my stuff?

2710
03:02:19,420 --> 03:02:21,120
Since I lost it all.

2711
03:02:24,400 --> 03:02:25,920
Like... Ok, ok, ok.

2712
03:02:26,760 --> 03:02:27,620
Ok, ok, ok.

2713
03:02:35,220 --> 03:02:36,880
I hate the nightmare!

2714
03:02:37,960 --> 03:02:40,180
In this room specifically!

2715
03:02:44,060 --> 03:02:44,620
Eh...

2716
03:02:54,270 --> 03:02:54,830
Nice.

2717
03:02:55,170 --> 03:02:55,890
Where is the other guy?

2718
03:02:56,390 --> 03:02:57,490
Wait, where is... Oh.

2719
03:03:01,350 --> 03:03:01,910
We

2720
03:03:09,420 --> 03:03:10,300
took him out.

2721
03:03:10,380 --> 03:03:11,620
These lizards are no problem.

2722
03:03:13,300 --> 03:03:14,900
These lizards are no problem.

2723
03:03:16,280 --> 03:03:17,000
Oh wait.

2724
03:03:17,100 --> 03:03:17,860
Oh, ok.

2725
03:03:20,680 --> 03:03:21,240
Hi.

2726
03:03:22,740 --> 03:03:23,940
Oh, that's safe.

2727
03:03:24,040 --> 03:03:25,920
So I can keep my rorbs at least.

2728
03:03:28,200 --> 03:03:28,840
Why, Tina?

2729
03:03:29,040 --> 03:03:29,400
Why?

2730
03:03:30,260 --> 03:03:31,780
Guys, this part is so tricky!

2731
03:04:07,340 --> 03:04:08,140
Ouchie, ouchie, ouchie.

2732
03:04:14,740 --> 03:04:16,100
Wait, hold on.

2733
03:04:17,240 --> 03:04:18,000
Holy water!

2734
03:04:29,700 --> 03:04:31,280
I'm behind his back!

2735
03:04:31,400 --> 03:04:32,940
Oh no, he's going back into the loop.

2736
03:04:33,760 --> 03:04:36,060
Glurp, glurp, glurp, glurp, glurp, glurp, glurp, glurp, glurp.

2737
03:04:45,480 --> 03:04:46,000
Ouch, please.

2738
03:04:48,300 --> 03:04:48,760
Please!

2739
03:04:56,920 --> 03:04:57,800
Uh-oh, wait.

2740
03:04:58,960 --> 03:04:59,960
Wait, shoot.

2741
03:05:01,300 --> 03:05:02,760
Stop, stop, stop, Dante!

2742
03:05:02,980 --> 03:05:05,040
You have to hit this part first, Dante!

2743
03:05:05,300 --> 03:05:06,700
Don't you remember, Dante!

2744
03:05:07,080 --> 03:05:08,020
Don't you know!

2745
03:05:08,700 --> 03:05:10,020
Dante, don't you know!

2746
03:05:10,160 --> 03:05:10,440
Dante!

2747
03:05:10,660 --> 03:05:12,240
Oh my god, why isn't it coming down though?

2748
03:05:13,260 --> 03:05:14,380
Wait, no, no, please.

2749
03:05:16,140 --> 03:05:16,600
Ok.

2750
03:05:26,690 --> 03:05:27,690
No, no, no, please!

2751
03:05:27,870 --> 03:05:28,930
I'm trying to hit the menu!

2752
03:05:28,930 --> 03:05:30,150
Let me hit the menu!

2753
03:05:30,410 --> 03:05:31,890
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

2754
03:05:34,030 --> 03:05:35,250
Ok, ok, ok.

2755
03:05:41,990 --> 03:05:44,130
It heals, it heals, it heals.

2756
03:05:54,560 --> 03:05:58,760
If you want DT, you can't have any!

2757
03:06:26,120 --> 03:06:27,280
We did it!

2758
03:06:34,040 --> 03:06:35,360
Get out of here, Trish.

2759
03:06:35,440 --> 03:06:36,000
Oh my god.

2760
03:06:37,380 --> 03:06:41,820
Oh my god, he's still gonna save her.

2761
03:06:42,680 --> 03:06:43,980
Dante is such a gentleman.

2762
03:06:50,310 --> 03:06:57,210
I'm guessing that's the last time I have to fight the nightmare because, you know, he was so big and bad in that part, right?

2763
03:06:58,070 --> 03:07:00,050
That was the final boss, right guys?

2764
03:07:01,630 --> 03:07:01,990
Right?

2765
03:07:05,270 --> 03:07:06,390
It is the last...

2766
03:07:08,050 --> 03:07:08,490
Dante!

2767
03:07:14,050 --> 03:07:16,310
I never let a pretty girl die.

2768
03:07:28,500 --> 03:07:30,460
Yeah, get out of here.

2769
03:07:55,420 --> 03:07:56,680
Is she gonna cry?

2770
03:07:56,840 --> 03:07:57,500
She's a devil.

2771
03:07:58,100 --> 03:07:58,900
She might cry.

2772
03:07:59,020 --> 03:07:59,640
She might be like...

2773
03:08:07,580 --> 03:08:10,140
Wait, Trish came up with the nightmare?

2774
03:08:10,700 --> 03:08:11,600
You're crazy!

2775
03:08:12,620 --> 03:08:15,780
What kind of psycho makes that thing up?

2776
03:08:17,640 --> 03:08:19,680
I don't wanna see what my rank is.

2777
03:08:20,300 --> 03:08:21,620
I knew it.

2778
03:08:21,620 --> 03:08:22,660
Whatever.

2779
03:08:23,240 --> 03:08:23,980
I don't care.

2780
03:08:24,700 --> 03:08:25,880
I don't care.

2781
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:29,820
You know the rules.

2782
03:08:30,500 --> 03:08:32,480
And so do I.

2783
03:08:34,060 --> 03:08:35,320
Wait, I saved, right?

2784
03:08:40,540 --> 03:08:41,740
Next mission!

2785
03:08:43,560 --> 03:08:44,700
D for Dante, everyone.

2786
03:08:44,840 --> 03:08:45,840
Living Cave.

2787
03:08:46,640 --> 03:08:49,020
Pulsate the heart and open the last gate.

2788
03:08:49,160 --> 03:08:52,320
Oh my gosh, you guys, we have just three missions left.

2789
03:08:53,800 --> 03:08:55,540
This one, 22, 23!

2790
03:08:58,460 --> 03:08:59,560
Hate this mission?

2791
03:08:59,720 --> 03:09:00,440
Oh, right.

2792
03:09:04,500 --> 03:09:05,840
Can I go through here?

2793
03:09:06,920 --> 03:09:08,200
Is this where I came from?

2794
03:09:08,660 --> 03:09:09,260
What is this?

2795
03:09:11,340 --> 03:09:12,680
Oh, this is where I came from.

2796
03:09:14,760 --> 03:09:16,240
Nothing else in here, right?

2797
03:09:26,970 --> 03:09:28,400
You know the rules.

2798
03:09:29,270 --> 03:09:30,510
Wait, how's my health?

2799
03:09:30,610 --> 03:09:31,170
OK, we're good.

2800
03:09:35,490 --> 03:09:36,490
Holy water!

2801
03:09:36,870 --> 03:09:37,430
Thank you!

2802
03:09:38,170 --> 03:09:39,110
I used mine.

2803
03:09:41,050 --> 03:09:41,950
Oh, what's in here?

2804
03:09:44,870 --> 03:09:46,510
Oh, it's the heart.

2805
03:09:49,630 --> 03:09:51,430
So I gotta pulsate it?

2806
03:09:52,350 --> 03:09:53,230
OK, hold on.

2807
03:09:55,310 --> 03:09:55,870
Where is it?

2808
03:09:55,930 --> 03:09:56,650
What's shooting?

2809
03:09:58,130 --> 03:10:00,510
I think there's a lot of things pulsating here.

2810
03:10:00,610 --> 03:10:01,310
I mean...

2811
03:10:02,030 --> 03:10:03,090
OK, what's in this room?

2812
03:10:04,910 --> 03:10:06,370
I can't go in yet?

2813
03:10:07,830 --> 03:10:09,730
Strange claws are blocking the entrance.

2814
03:10:09,990 --> 03:10:12,310
It's impossible to open, even with my strength.

2815
03:10:12,970 --> 03:10:14,590
Oh, but it opens up when I walk away.

2816
03:10:15,650 --> 03:10:17,070
OK, guess we gotta go in here.

2817
03:10:27,520 --> 03:10:29,080
Oh, that was so close!

2818
03:10:32,820 --> 03:10:33,340
Ouch!

2819
03:10:33,700 --> 03:10:33,820
Oh.

2820
03:10:34,780 --> 03:10:38,660
Is this timed?

2821
03:10:39,140 --> 03:10:39,620
Oh gosh.

2822
03:10:42,320 --> 03:10:43,480
I can't see!

2823
03:10:44,600 --> 03:10:45,680
I can't see!

2824
03:10:56,400 --> 03:10:57,150
Oh, it's not?

2825
03:10:57,290 --> 03:10:57,510
OK.

2826
03:11:00,150 --> 03:11:01,690
Run, run, run!

2827
03:11:05,580 --> 03:11:06,760
Jelly door.

2828
03:11:13,100 --> 03:11:14,120
What's here?

2829
03:11:15,180 --> 03:11:16,140
What's in here?

2830
03:11:16,240 --> 03:11:17,200
Oh my gosh.

2831
03:11:22,860 --> 03:11:26,320
OK, luckily this isn't like the mirror world.

2832
03:11:26,760 --> 03:11:28,240
Let's stay away from the tongues.

2833
03:11:28,820 --> 03:11:29,360
Oh, nevermind.

2834
03:11:37,440 --> 03:11:39,580
I think that was a dead end.

2835
03:11:48,280 --> 03:11:49,200
Just keep running.

2836
03:11:50,800 --> 03:11:52,600
Oh, it's this thing again.

2837
03:11:59,910 --> 03:12:00,630
Watch out!

2838
03:12:00,690 --> 03:12:00,990
Watch out!

2839
03:12:01,690 --> 03:12:02,730
It's exploding!

2840
03:12:02,890 --> 03:12:04,310
It's disgusting!

2841
03:12:04,790 --> 03:12:06,330
It's like firecrackers.

2842
03:12:09,470 --> 03:12:13,490
OK, I can't stand too still or else other things are gonna get me.

2843
03:12:15,010 --> 03:12:15,830
Got it.

2844
03:12:16,330 --> 03:12:18,410
We have little dune monsters and everything.

2845
03:12:18,590 --> 03:12:18,910
Oh my gosh.

2846
03:12:27,730 --> 03:12:29,050
Oh, watch out!

2847
03:12:33,380 --> 03:12:35,180
Oh, there's still Lickies.

2848
03:12:35,380 --> 03:12:39,240
There's some Licky Tongues and everything.

2849
03:12:39,440 --> 03:12:40,800
OK, onwards!

2850
03:12:41,940 --> 03:12:42,760
What's going on?

2851
03:12:42,820 --> 03:12:43,240
Oh my gosh.

2852
03:12:46,680 --> 03:12:46,980
Take

2853
03:12:53,050 --> 03:12:53,650
this!

2854
03:12:53,970 --> 03:12:54,290
Shoot!

2855
03:12:54,830 --> 03:12:55,430
No!

2856
03:12:56,290 --> 03:12:57,390
Oh my gosh.

2857
03:12:57,870 --> 03:13:00,010
They really took a number on me!

2858
03:13:01,850 --> 03:13:04,450
I was getting licked really bad.

2859
03:13:07,570 --> 03:13:08,830
Time to change.

2860
03:13:10,650 --> 03:13:13,650
Wow, that really got me bad.

2861
03:13:14,270 --> 03:13:14,710
Oh shoot.

2862
03:13:18,800 --> 03:13:19,750
Please, Devil Trigger!

2863
03:13:20,530 --> 03:13:21,890
Oh, I don't have Devil Trigger.

2864
03:13:22,530 --> 03:13:22,970
Oh no.

2865
03:13:23,530 --> 03:13:24,010
Oh no!

2866
03:13:24,650 --> 03:13:25,590
Guys, I'm gonna die.

2867
03:13:27,410 --> 03:13:29,110
He eats my Devil Trigger!

2868
03:13:50,470 --> 03:13:53,870
OK, I'm gonna Devil Trigger just so I can get some health back.

2869
03:13:54,550 --> 03:13:55,610
Holy cow.

2870
03:13:56,470 --> 03:13:58,290
One HP in a dream.

2871
03:14:04,950 --> 03:14:06,490
Oh, that doesn't sound very...

2872
03:14:06,490 --> 03:14:07,350
Oh my god, no!

2873
03:14:08,090 --> 03:14:08,890
It's the bat!

2874
03:14:09,530 --> 03:14:10,970
It's the freaking bat!

2875
03:14:11,790 --> 03:14:12,970
Oh my gosh, freaking bat.

2876
03:14:14,010 --> 03:14:14,550
It's me!

2877
03:14:15,250 --> 03:14:15,890
Oh my gosh, go.

2878
03:14:16,190 --> 03:14:16,650
Go Dante.

2879
03:14:16,870 --> 03:14:17,230
Just run.

2880
03:14:17,670 --> 03:14:18,390
Dante, just run.

2881
03:14:18,730 --> 03:14:19,530
Dante, just go.

2882
03:14:20,190 --> 03:14:20,950
Dante, just go.

2883
03:14:21,270 --> 03:14:21,870
They can't jump.

2884
03:14:21,930 --> 03:14:22,350
They're stupid.

2885
03:14:44,180 --> 03:14:45,280
Now this looks tight.

2886
03:15:05,230 --> 03:15:06,470
I don't know what's going on.

2887
03:15:06,530 --> 03:15:08,050
You guys, I'm just...

2888
03:15:08,050 --> 03:15:08,970
Do I have a Vital Star?

2889
03:15:09,050 --> 03:15:09,370
I do?

2890
03:15:09,470 --> 03:15:11,150
Oh my gosh, I can't go into the menu.

2891
03:15:11,290 --> 03:15:11,770
Oh, I can.

2892
03:15:12,070 --> 03:15:12,890
I do have one.

2893
03:15:15,030 --> 03:15:15,750
Holy moly.

2894
03:15:22,990 --> 03:15:24,430
Holy moly.

2895
03:15:29,570 --> 03:15:30,290
OK.

2896
03:15:33,360 --> 03:15:34,400
Don't miss, Dante!

2897
03:15:36,200 --> 03:15:38,020
Why is that so far away?

2898
03:15:44,520 --> 03:15:45,640
Dante, don't miss.

2899
03:15:46,080 --> 03:15:46,800
Dante, don't miss.

2900
03:15:47,980 --> 03:15:49,060
Dante doesn't miss!

2901
03:15:49,460 --> 03:15:50,460
Dante doesn't miss!

2902
03:16:03,400 --> 03:16:05,360
It's pulsating.

2903
03:16:20,240 --> 03:16:23,300
Can I get over there by jumping?

2904
03:16:25,880 --> 03:16:26,520
Nice.

2905
03:16:27,200 --> 03:16:28,060
Here we go!

2906
03:16:33,680 --> 03:16:35,600
This one wasn't so bad.

2907
03:16:36,760 --> 03:16:38,420
This one wasn't so bad.

2908
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:41,860
I got a C, but whatever.

2909
03:16:47,860 --> 03:16:48,260
OK.

2910
03:16:49,480 --> 03:16:50,280
Save, please.

2911
03:16:51,860 --> 03:16:54,000
I don't know how long it's going to take me to beat the rest of the game.

2912
03:16:54,480 --> 03:16:57,600
Honestly, I was like thinking I was going to be here for like 7 hours.

2913
03:16:57,600 --> 03:16:58,560
Did I say that?

2914
03:16:59,260 --> 03:17:03,320
As I might, it might take me 4 hours to beat the last 2 levels.

2915
03:17:04,320 --> 03:17:05,140
We'll see.

2916
03:17:16,330 --> 03:17:17,290
You're cruising?

2917
03:17:17,530 --> 03:17:18,410
I don't know about that.

2918
03:17:18,650 --> 03:17:19,710
Legendary battle?

2919
03:17:22,510 --> 03:17:24,410
Let's buy some Vital Stars.

2920
03:17:24,910 --> 03:17:25,810
A Vital Star.

2921
03:17:29,370 --> 03:17:30,970
I have a lot of Devil Stars.

2922
03:17:31,950 --> 03:17:33,210
I have one Holy Water.

2923
03:17:33,210 --> 03:17:36,710
Should I get an Untouchable?

2924
03:17:37,430 --> 03:17:39,950
It's either an Untouchable or a Holy Water.

2925
03:17:42,690 --> 03:17:43,310
Untouchable?

2926
03:17:43,510 --> 03:17:43,730
OK.

2927
03:17:50,980 --> 03:17:52,100
Untouchable is a good idea.

2928
03:17:53,680 --> 03:17:55,300
Holy Water won't help here.

2929
03:17:55,420 --> 03:17:55,780
Really?

2930
03:18:01,520 --> 03:18:02,500
Legendary battle.

2931
03:18:03,560 --> 03:18:04,540
Missions, start!

2932
03:18:07,440 --> 03:18:08,560
I'm getting married!

2933
03:18:13,940 --> 03:18:16,980
Wow, it's beautiful here.

2934
03:18:18,940 --> 03:18:21,760
Here comes the bride.

2935
03:18:22,220 --> 03:18:24,580
All dressed in red.

2936
03:18:26,520 --> 03:18:30,740
Table of contents.

2937
03:18:30,880 --> 03:18:32,120
Unlock every enemy file.

2938
03:18:51,220 --> 03:18:51,920
Trish!

2939
03:18:54,820 --> 03:18:57,460
Those are not around her wrists.

2940
03:19:00,800 --> 03:19:03,120
Oh no, I blinked too early!

2941
03:19:07,740 --> 03:19:10,500
How do I defeat a statue?

2942
03:19:11,720 --> 03:19:13,100
Here we are.

2943
03:19:16,380 --> 03:19:18,820
Those are not around her wrists.

2944
03:19:29,920 --> 03:19:32,500
My controller is really...

2945
03:19:36,220 --> 03:19:37,060
Trish!

2946
03:19:38,380 --> 03:19:39,640
Oh my god, she's dead.

2947
03:19:40,500 --> 03:19:42,860
Oh my god, she took the hit for me.

2948
03:19:43,100 --> 03:19:44,220
She saved me!

2949
03:19:56,280 --> 03:19:58,580
Oh god, he's got another one.

2950
03:20:06,300 --> 03:20:07,820
I went psycho mode.

2951
03:20:10,640 --> 03:20:11,880
I unlocked...

2952
03:20:11,880 --> 03:20:13,460
The Devil May Cry power.

2953
03:20:22,160 --> 03:20:24,420
How long are you going to keep yapping?

2954
03:20:24,580 --> 03:20:25,180
I mean zapping.

2955
03:20:29,380 --> 03:20:30,940
Real cutscene time.

2956
03:20:31,060 --> 03:20:31,520
Oh my god.

2957
03:20:34,480 --> 03:20:35,720
He's a zapper.

2958
03:20:38,220 --> 03:20:39,500
Oh my god!

2959
03:20:40,800 --> 03:20:42,860
Cover your bits please though.

2960
03:20:43,180 --> 03:20:44,420
No one wants to see that.

2961
03:20:45,120 --> 03:20:54,170
It got so quiet all of a sudden.

2962
03:21:03,860 --> 03:21:05,300
Are we...

2963
03:21:07,080 --> 03:21:08,820
This feels like...

2964
03:21:10,840 --> 03:21:12,780
This feels like a final battle.

2965
03:21:16,100 --> 03:21:18,080
She was hot.

2966
03:21:29,680 --> 03:21:31,540
Red eyes.

2967
03:21:35,360 --> 03:21:36,760
Mundus.

2968
03:21:53,440 --> 03:21:54,940
I turned into Sparda.

2969
03:21:57,420 --> 03:21:58,860
What the...

2970
03:21:58,860 --> 03:21:59,900
Oh my god.

2971
03:22:08,070 --> 03:22:09,290
Oh shit!

2972
03:22:09,650 --> 03:22:10,350
Oh my god.

2973
03:22:10,990 --> 03:22:15,490
What is happening?

2974
03:22:15,970 --> 03:22:19,210
Oh my god, these controls are really evil.

2975
03:22:21,610 --> 03:22:21,830
Am

2976
03:22:30,780 --> 03:22:30,980
I?

2977
03:22:31,400 --> 03:22:33,220
These controls are so evil!

2978
03:22:38,040 --> 03:22:39,980
Just gotta keep holding down.

2979
03:22:41,220 --> 03:22:42,980
Wait, he's not taking any damage though.

2980
03:22:53,560 --> 03:22:54,080
Ouch!

2981
03:22:54,080 --> 03:22:54,600
Where?

2982
03:22:54,940 --> 03:22:55,600
What is hitting me?

2983
03:22:57,680 --> 03:22:59,300
Oh, I see his...

2984
03:22:59,300 --> 03:22:59,560
Oh

2985
03:23:03,140 --> 03:23:04,860
my god, this is so...

2986
03:23:04,860 --> 03:23:06,020
Oh my gosh.

2987
03:23:15,520 --> 03:23:17,640
I summoned a whole ass dragon!

2988
03:23:18,280 --> 03:23:18,700
Oh no.

2989
03:23:19,260 --> 03:23:21,180
I gotta take out the big balls again.

2990
03:23:28,040 --> 03:23:29,260
Guys, I'm almost there.

2991
03:23:47,760 --> 03:23:49,920
It's ok, I didn't need to use the vital on that.

2992
03:23:50,860 --> 03:23:51,400
It's ok.

2993
03:23:52,380 --> 03:23:52,680
How?

2994
03:23:52,980 --> 03:23:54,920
I probably gonna have to watch all the cutscenes again though.

2995
03:23:56,960 --> 03:23:57,980
Oh my gosh.

2996
03:23:58,180 --> 03:24:00,240
Let's just skip through the cutscenes.

2997
03:24:01,700 --> 03:24:03,440
Use D-pad for no inverse control?

2998
03:24:03,580 --> 03:24:04,060
Really?

2999
03:24:04,640 --> 03:24:05,760
Will that actually work?

3000
03:24:06,840 --> 03:24:09,260
And I can buy another vital star.

3001
03:24:09,840 --> 03:24:10,660
So I will.

3002
03:24:12,040 --> 03:24:13,480
And another untouchable.

3003
03:24:14,640 --> 03:24:15,560
So I will.

3004
03:24:16,600 --> 03:24:17,400
Devil stars?

3005
03:24:17,520 --> 03:24:18,800
I have like 5 devil stars.

3006
03:24:18,920 --> 03:24:19,260
We're good.

3007
03:24:19,420 --> 03:24:19,680
We're good.

3008
03:24:22,420 --> 03:24:23,740
I'm good on devil stars.

3009
03:24:30,490 --> 03:24:32,170
Oh wait, I have to go through this again.

3010
03:24:38,250 --> 03:24:40,990
If I just keep summoning dragons...

3011
03:24:40,990 --> 03:24:41,970
But he like...

3012
03:24:41,970 --> 03:24:42,790
Ok, hold on.

3013
03:24:44,890 --> 03:24:46,350
Oh, oh, ok, D-pad.

3014
03:24:46,530 --> 03:24:47,690
Oh wow, you guys are right.

3015
03:24:53,640 --> 03:24:54,960
Trying to get the...

3016
03:24:54,960 --> 03:24:56,940
Oh my gosh, he...

3017
03:24:56,940 --> 03:24:58,540
He summoned it so quickly.

3018
03:25:02,700 --> 03:25:03,500
Oh gosh.

3019
03:25:04,180 --> 03:25:06,000
It's really slow though, the D-pad.

3020
03:25:06,380 --> 03:25:07,320
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3021
03:25:09,960 --> 03:25:10,700
Oh my god.

3022
03:25:10,800 --> 03:25:11,360
Oh my god.

3023
03:25:11,520 --> 03:25:12,300
Oh my god.

3024
03:25:12,440 --> 03:25:12,940
Oh my god.

3025
03:25:13,640 --> 03:25:15,620
This fight is insane.

3026
03:25:16,020 --> 03:25:17,940
This fight is actually insane.

3027
03:25:18,440 --> 03:25:20,600
How the fuck is anybody supposed to do this?

3028
03:25:21,080 --> 03:25:21,360
What?

3029
03:25:22,880 --> 03:25:24,200
Oh my god.

3030
03:25:25,340 --> 03:25:26,280
Use the dodge?

3031
03:25:26,380 --> 03:25:26,980
What dodge?

3032
03:25:27,300 --> 03:25:29,120
Wait, A to move faster?

3033
03:25:29,380 --> 03:25:30,160
Oh, I can actually?

3034
03:25:36,470 --> 03:25:38,670
Press jump to fly faster.

3035
03:25:40,910 --> 03:25:41,690
Ok, hold on.

3036
03:25:48,970 --> 03:25:50,090
This is...

3037
03:25:52,410 --> 03:25:54,230
Yeah, this is a fight.

3038
03:25:59,830 --> 03:26:01,730
This is a fight.

3039
03:26:02,430 --> 03:26:04,090
And then they throw you right on in.

3040
03:26:11,210 --> 03:26:12,890
Ok guys, I gotta lock in.

3041
03:26:13,570 --> 03:26:15,050
I gotta lock in for real.

3042
03:26:55,310 --> 03:26:55,870
Can

3043
03:27:30,450 --> 03:27:33,210
I use it even when the balls are attached?

3044
03:27:34,150 --> 03:27:36,750
I mean, I don't know how else to say it.

3045
03:27:36,970 --> 03:27:37,410
Oh shoot.

3046
03:27:37,530 --> 03:27:37,890
Oh shoot.

3047
03:27:37,990 --> 03:27:38,210
Oh shoot.

3048
03:27:41,110 --> 03:27:41,470
Yes?

3049
03:27:41,630 --> 03:27:41,970
Oh, I can?

3050
03:27:42,390 --> 03:27:42,870
Oh, I can.

3051
03:27:44,390 --> 03:27:45,110
Ouchie, ouch, ouch.

3052
03:27:45,290 --> 03:27:46,250
Ouchie, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3053
03:27:47,070 --> 03:27:47,930
Oh my gosh.

3054
03:27:47,990 --> 03:27:48,370
Oh my gosh.

3055
03:27:48,490 --> 03:27:48,770
Hold on.

3056
03:28:08,150 --> 03:28:09,670
Losing the game before I bought it?

3057
03:28:09,750 --> 03:28:10,150
Oh shit.

3058
03:28:12,840 --> 03:28:14,780
I love legendary battle on the track.

3059
03:28:15,800 --> 03:28:16,960
I forgot to buy it.

3060
03:28:17,020 --> 03:28:17,200
Oops.

3061
03:28:19,760 --> 03:28:21,800
This is gonna end badly with that rock.

3062
03:28:21,860 --> 03:28:22,420
Don't worry.

3063
03:28:22,660 --> 03:28:23,600
I saw it.

3064
03:28:34,300 --> 03:28:35,640
I'm preparing myself.

3065
03:28:36,360 --> 03:28:37,840
I'm mustering up the...

3066
03:28:39,980 --> 03:28:40,660
Ah, shoot.

3067
03:28:40,880 --> 03:28:41,540
Ah, shoot.

3068
03:28:41,720 --> 03:28:42,880
Oh, that did end badly.

3069
03:28:43,040 --> 03:28:43,540
Ok, nevermind.

3070
03:28:43,620 --> 03:28:44,080
I attempted.

3071
03:28:45,260 --> 03:28:45,700
Oh my god.

3072
03:29:00,640 --> 03:29:02,400
I mean, you're just gonna get hit like that?

3073
03:29:12,680 --> 03:29:13,740
After all my hard work?

3074
03:29:14,080 --> 03:29:17,420
Getting hit by a living car?

3075
03:29:17,520 --> 03:29:18,500
Thanks for the gift, dude.

3076
03:29:23,100 --> 03:29:23,940
Phase 2.

3077
03:29:25,020 --> 03:29:25,720
Oh boy.

3078
03:29:33,660 --> 03:29:34,640
Oh my god.

3079
03:29:34,960 --> 03:29:36,300
I'm so slow all of a sudden.

3080
03:29:37,940 --> 03:29:43,200
What the hell do I do here?

3081
03:29:43,540 --> 03:29:44,860
I did it all of a sudden.

3082
03:29:50,580 --> 03:29:53,800
I knew my health was bad, but I just was trying to see what to do.

3083
03:29:54,920 --> 03:29:56,060
What do I...

3084
03:29:56,060 --> 03:29:57,880
How do I attack him?

3085
03:30:04,190 --> 03:30:08,410
Do I wait for the middle part to come up?

3086
03:30:10,310 --> 03:30:10,830
Ok.

3087
03:30:11,950 --> 03:30:12,390
Oops.

3088
03:30:13,870 --> 03:30:14,310
Alright.

3089
03:30:18,230 --> 03:30:21,030
Let's buy my stuff and then not forget to...

3090
03:30:21,030 --> 03:30:21,170
Ok.

3091
03:30:22,890 --> 03:30:23,330
So...

3092
03:30:23,330 --> 03:30:23,830
You know what?

3093
03:30:23,970 --> 03:30:25,210
What did I get before?

3094
03:30:25,910 --> 03:30:26,870
I got a vital star.

3095
03:30:27,330 --> 03:30:28,370
I got an untouchable.

3096
03:30:30,370 --> 03:30:31,050
And you know what?

3097
03:30:31,070 --> 03:30:32,150
I will get another devil star.

3098
03:30:32,250 --> 03:30:32,810
Why not?

3099
03:30:37,200 --> 03:30:37,940
Round trip.

3100
03:30:38,040 --> 03:30:38,480
What's that?

3101
03:30:38,560 --> 03:30:39,120
Oh, this one?

3102
03:30:39,120 --> 03:30:42,780
The one that I don't have enough orbs for because I just spent it all on things.

3103
03:30:47,180 --> 03:30:48,820
Slash and DT has extra range.

3104
03:30:49,120 --> 03:30:49,220
Ok.

3105
03:30:52,580 --> 03:30:53,660
You need to platform.

3106
03:30:53,960 --> 03:30:54,080
Ok.

3107
03:30:58,970 --> 03:30:59,890
Yes, buy it.

3108
03:30:59,930 --> 03:31:00,930
Guys, I have no money.

3109
03:31:03,230 --> 03:31:04,170
I have no money.

3110
03:31:06,650 --> 03:31:07,370
It's all good.

3111
03:31:09,990 --> 03:31:10,510
Ok.

3112
03:31:10,630 --> 03:31:11,530
Ok, locking in.

3113
03:31:12,470 --> 03:31:12,810
Let's go.

3114
03:31:18,340 --> 03:31:19,380
Locking in.

3115
03:31:19,540 --> 03:31:19,720
Let's go.

3116
03:31:22,780 --> 03:31:23,360
Let's go.

3117
03:31:25,340 --> 03:31:26,380
I'm guessing...

3118
03:31:26,380 --> 03:31:27,260
Oh my gosh!

3119
03:31:27,360 --> 03:31:28,080
Ok, nevermind.

3120
03:31:28,160 --> 03:31:29,260
I did not see those.

3121
03:31:29,800 --> 03:31:29,820
Oh!

3122
03:31:30,640 --> 03:31:31,160
Dante!

3123
03:31:31,720 --> 03:31:33,040
Dante, you need to pay attention.

3124
03:31:57,660 --> 03:31:59,580
Why is it so loud all of a sudden?

3125
03:32:12,130 --> 03:32:13,010
I don't care.

3126
03:32:13,410 --> 03:32:15,310
I'm just gonna keep spamming it.

3127
03:32:17,210 --> 03:32:17,610
Yeah.

3128
03:32:22,680 --> 03:32:23,080
Wait!

3129
03:32:23,240 --> 03:32:24,280
Oh, I gotta use it.

3130
03:32:28,750 --> 03:32:30,270
I gotta use it.

3131
03:32:30,570 --> 03:32:30,890
One sec.

3132
03:32:31,130 --> 03:32:31,570
One sec.

3133
03:32:41,420 --> 03:32:41,820
Wait.

3134
03:32:41,980 --> 03:32:42,440
Oh my gosh.

3135
03:32:42,460 --> 03:32:43,500
I'm so almost dead.

3136
03:32:43,900 --> 03:32:44,900
I think I might die there.

3137
03:32:44,900 --> 03:32:45,380
I might die this round.

3138
03:32:45,780 --> 03:32:46,280
Probably.

3139
03:32:49,820 --> 03:32:51,380
I think I'll probably die.

3140
03:32:53,140 --> 03:32:54,060
Why not?

3141
03:32:57,540 --> 03:32:58,500
Another vital star.

3142
03:33:11,750 --> 03:33:12,390
Ok.

3143
03:33:22,100 --> 03:33:25,420
Sorry it got so loud all of a sudden in that one part.

3144
03:33:25,500 --> 03:33:26,220
It was kind of crazy.

3145
03:33:28,360 --> 03:33:28,560
Ok.

3146
03:33:40,430 --> 03:33:41,410
Ok, hold on.

3147
03:33:42,730 --> 03:33:44,750
Ok, my Devil Trigger is full.

3148
03:33:46,610 --> 03:33:48,610
We got the Sparda on.

3149
03:33:49,150 --> 03:33:49,590
Right?

3150
03:33:51,390 --> 03:33:52,270
Yeah, ok.

3151
03:33:53,030 --> 03:33:54,050
Wait, that means I can't...

3152
03:33:54,050 --> 03:33:55,810
Oh, I can Devil Trigger, but...

3153
03:33:56,850 --> 03:33:57,370
Interesting.

3154
03:34:05,170 --> 03:34:06,310
You can now.

3155
03:34:10,270 --> 03:34:10,790
So...

3156
03:34:10,790 --> 03:34:13,370
I saw someone say this and I'm gonna try it.

3157
03:34:14,650 --> 03:34:15,290
Untouchable!

3158
03:34:16,650 --> 03:34:17,290
Yes!

3159
03:34:18,390 --> 03:34:19,310
Devil Trigger!

3160
03:34:19,590 --> 03:34:19,930
Yes!

3161
03:34:20,950 --> 03:34:21,570
And...

3162
03:34:23,170 --> 03:34:23,810
Wow,

3163
03:34:28,200 --> 03:34:28,820
that's kind of rude.

3164
03:34:33,790 --> 03:34:34,790
Oh my god.

3165
03:34:34,950 --> 03:34:36,910
He's just absorbing the damage.

3166
03:34:44,550 --> 03:34:45,130
Yes!

3167
03:34:49,680 --> 03:34:51,500
He's just eating it up.

3168
03:35:04,300 --> 03:35:05,600
How do I get him though?

3169
03:35:09,040 --> 03:35:11,240
Guys, I'm gonna die in the goop.

3170
03:35:11,240 --> 03:35:12,400
Guys, I'm in the goop.

3171
03:35:12,840 --> 03:35:15,100
Guys, I'm gonna die from the goop.

3172
03:35:15,240 --> 03:35:15,560
Oh, ok.

3173
03:35:16,380 --> 03:35:17,200
We're good, maybe?

3174
03:35:18,040 --> 03:35:18,800
I say good.

3175
03:35:19,040 --> 03:35:20,220
Good is like, you know, subjective.

3176
03:35:22,960 --> 03:35:23,400
Ouch.

3177
03:35:26,220 --> 03:35:27,180
Sword with DT?

3178
03:35:27,260 --> 03:35:28,240
I tried, but...

3179
03:35:29,500 --> 03:35:29,940
I...

3180
03:35:30,920 --> 03:35:32,160
I ran out.

3181
03:35:33,020 --> 03:35:34,040
At the very end.

3182
03:35:34,740 --> 03:35:35,280
Ok, hold on.

3183
03:35:37,200 --> 03:35:37,940
Oh, Devil Trigger?

3184
03:35:41,600 --> 03:35:42,220
Wait.

3185
03:35:43,320 --> 03:35:43,920
Wait.

3186
03:35:44,220 --> 03:35:44,900
Oh, guys.

3187
03:35:45,840 --> 03:35:47,860
Guys, I'm gonna die in the...

3188
03:35:47,860 --> 03:35:48,760
I'm gonna die.

3189
03:35:49,100 --> 03:35:49,700
I'm gonna die.

3190
03:35:52,750 --> 03:35:53,830
Goop is a good idea!

3191
03:35:57,840 --> 03:35:58,850
It doesn't really...

3192
03:36:00,790 --> 03:36:03,130
I got gooped, guys.

3193
03:36:03,190 --> 03:36:03,850
I got gooped.

3194
03:36:05,840 --> 03:36:07,150
I have no more heals.

3195
03:36:11,830 --> 03:36:13,790
Use shotgun against the orbs, really?

3196
03:36:14,870 --> 03:36:15,310
Oh.

3197
03:36:16,130 --> 03:36:17,790
If I can aim for...

3198
03:36:21,570 --> 03:36:22,210
Oh, wait.

3199
03:36:22,730 --> 03:36:23,590
Oh, my gosh.

3200
03:36:25,830 --> 03:36:26,490
Oh, gosh.

3201
03:36:26,650 --> 03:36:26,990
Oh, gosh.

3202
03:36:27,130 --> 03:36:27,450
Oh, gosh.

3203
03:36:27,890 --> 03:36:28,770
Here they come.

3204
03:36:38,490 --> 03:36:41,450
Try the untouchable and Rambo melee in the lava.

3205
03:36:50,430 --> 03:36:50,990
Hmm.

3206
03:36:52,390 --> 03:36:54,350
You can use holy water during phase 2.

3207
03:36:54,510 --> 03:36:54,890
Really?

3208
03:36:55,410 --> 03:36:57,030
Ok, good to know.

3209
03:37:01,310 --> 03:37:02,430
We made...

3210
03:37:02,430 --> 03:37:04,410
He just eats so much of it, you know?

3211
03:37:04,990 --> 03:37:09,150
So maybe if I do sword when I untouchable instead of spam the thing...

3212
03:37:14,330 --> 03:37:15,450
Devastator, Vital...

3213
03:37:15,450 --> 03:37:16,010
Untouchable.

3214
03:37:21,500 --> 03:37:23,440
Stand on the closest platform and sword.

3215
03:37:23,620 --> 03:37:23,780
Ok.

3216
03:37:24,780 --> 03:37:25,820
Ok, ok, ok.

3217
03:37:26,020 --> 03:37:26,300
Ok!

3218
03:37:27,300 --> 03:37:29,080
We got this, guys!

3219
03:37:31,400 --> 03:37:33,540
We got this, guys!

3220
03:37:33,800 --> 03:37:35,180
We got this, guys.

3221
03:37:37,660 --> 03:37:38,840
And then round trip.

3222
03:37:38,960 --> 03:37:40,020
Yeah, the thing I don't have.

3223
03:37:49,390 --> 03:37:50,350
Locking in!

3224
03:37:51,490 --> 03:37:53,450
Can I hit him from this far away?

3225
03:37:56,290 --> 03:37:58,170
Do I have to be super close to him?

3226
03:37:59,190 --> 03:37:59,990
Oh, my God, why?

3227
03:38:01,710 --> 03:38:04,150
Sorry, I'm turning it way low.

3228
03:38:08,110 --> 03:38:08,910
Locking in!

3229
03:38:18,670 --> 03:38:21,150
Excuse me, can we not do double things, please?

3230
03:38:21,610 --> 03:38:23,850
I can only focus on one at a time.

3231
03:38:24,370 --> 03:38:27,270
Ok, I'm trying to get the dang orb, but...

3232
03:38:27,270 --> 03:38:28,090
They're just everywhere.

3233
03:38:28,930 --> 03:38:29,170
Ok.

3234
03:38:29,670 --> 03:38:30,230
You know what?

3235
03:38:30,230 --> 03:38:30,470
Ok.

3236
03:38:30,810 --> 03:38:33,450
Ok, I got... No, I didn't get a single orb.

3237
03:38:40,160 --> 03:38:40,840
Ok.

3238
03:38:41,360 --> 03:38:42,320
There we go!

3239
03:38:42,560 --> 03:38:43,060
I'm DT!

3240
03:38:48,540 --> 03:38:49,220
And...

3241
03:38:52,130 --> 03:38:53,290
Yes!

3242
03:38:54,450 --> 03:38:54,910
DT!

3243
03:39:01,900 --> 03:39:02,580
Devastator!

3244
03:39:19,160 --> 03:39:20,080
There it is.

3245
03:39:21,780 --> 03:39:23,020
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

3246
03:39:32,420 --> 03:39:34,000
He's really far away.

3247
03:39:34,100 --> 03:39:34,940
Go, dragon!

3248
03:39:35,200 --> 03:39:35,620
Travel!

3249
03:39:39,930 --> 03:39:40,470
Ok.

3250
03:39:42,550 --> 03:39:43,630
Second form.

3251
03:39:44,330 --> 03:39:44,650
Let's go!

3252
03:39:46,010 --> 03:39:47,010
Oh, run away.

3253
03:39:48,750 --> 03:39:50,970
Alright, platforms inbound.

3254
03:39:53,190 --> 03:39:54,610
Oh, ouch, ouch.

3255
03:39:54,870 --> 03:39:55,430
Don't do that.

3256
03:39:55,910 --> 03:39:56,790
Don't do that, please.

3257
03:39:57,490 --> 03:39:58,090
Don't do that.

3258
03:39:58,170 --> 03:39:58,810
I don't like these.

3259
03:39:59,950 --> 03:40:01,130
Don't stop it.

3260
03:40:02,470 --> 03:40:04,150
Stop with your little spikes.

3261
03:40:04,250 --> 03:40:05,450
Oh, can I get up here?

3262
03:40:06,570 --> 03:40:06,850
Hey!

3263
03:40:07,250 --> 03:40:07,490
Ok.

3264
03:40:08,830 --> 03:40:10,250
No, I don't have a platform.

3265
03:40:11,810 --> 03:40:13,030
Oh my gosh!

3266
03:40:13,230 --> 03:40:15,110
I really don't have a platform now!

3267
03:40:15,430 --> 03:40:16,190
You asshole!

3268
03:40:18,290 --> 03:40:18,970
Oh, here we go.

3269
03:40:21,090 --> 03:40:22,150
Oh, nevermind.

3270
03:40:22,690 --> 03:40:23,410
Come on, DT!

3271
03:40:23,490 --> 03:40:23,850
DT!

3272
03:40:23,910 --> 03:40:24,870
Grab for the ledge!

3273
03:40:24,870 --> 03:40:25,370
Ok.

3274
03:40:25,810 --> 03:40:26,770
Ah, sorry.

3275
03:40:27,190 --> 03:40:30,090
I need a second to compose myself.

3276
03:40:30,270 --> 03:40:30,390
Ok.

3277
03:40:31,830 --> 03:40:32,150
Ok.

3278
03:40:33,450 --> 03:40:34,050
Cheater!

3279
03:40:34,330 --> 03:40:35,030
Shut up.

3280
03:40:39,670 --> 03:40:42,530
If the game didn't want me to spam it, they wouldn't have let me.

3281
03:40:43,510 --> 03:40:43,770
Ok.

3282
03:40:44,510 --> 03:40:47,010
A DT and a slash attack.

3283
03:40:47,790 --> 03:40:48,250
DT.

3284
03:40:48,510 --> 03:40:49,470
Slash, slash, slash.

3285
03:40:50,010 --> 03:40:51,290
Slash, slash, slash.

3286
03:40:51,750 --> 03:40:52,630
Slash slash slash.

3287
03:40:53,190 --> 03:40:54,530
Slash slash slash slash.

3288
03:40:54,830 --> 03:40:54,930
Slash slash slash slash.

3289
03:40:54,930 --> 03:40:56,110
Slash slash slash slash.

3290
03:40:56,370 --> 03:40:56,450
Slash slash slash slash slash.

3291
03:40:56,450 --> 03:40:58,310
Slash, slash, slash, slash, slash.

3292
03:40:58,530 --> 03:40:59,970
Slash, slash, slash, slash, slash.

3293
03:41:00,190 --> 03:41:01,010
Slash, slash...

3294
03:41:01,010 --> 03:41:02,230
Okay, now I'm a baby.

3295
03:41:03,150 --> 03:41:03,630
And...

3296
03:41:03,630 --> 03:41:04,030
Tee-tee.

3297
03:41:07,090 --> 03:41:07,730
Tee-tee!

3298
03:41:08,030 --> 03:41:09,410
Slash, slash, slash, slash, slash.

3299
03:41:09,650 --> 03:41:12,970
Holy moly, this is doing numbers, baby.

3300
03:41:13,250 --> 03:41:14,730
Slash, slash, slash, slash, slash.

3301
03:41:14,970 --> 03:41:16,030
Slash, don't hit me!

3302
03:41:16,210 --> 03:41:17,410
Oh, okay, you did nothing.

3303
03:41:17,850 --> 03:41:19,690
Oh, uh, you're hurting me a little bit, actually.

3304
03:41:20,110 --> 03:41:21,210
Slash, slash, slash, slash.

3305
03:41:21,830 --> 03:41:22,990
Please, Dante, don't...

3306
03:41:22,990 --> 03:41:24,130
Don't, don't fall in the water!

3307
03:41:24,450 --> 03:41:25,270
Dante, um...

3308
03:41:26,770 --> 03:41:27,710
Dante!

3309
03:41:33,770 --> 03:41:34,410
Slash, slash!

3310
03:41:38,850 --> 03:41:40,540
The final blow!

3311
03:41:47,520 --> 03:41:48,160
Yeah!

3312
03:41:51,340 --> 03:41:53,540
Slash, slash, slash, slash, slash!

3313
03:41:56,270 --> 03:41:57,640
I love to slash.

3314
03:41:58,720 --> 03:42:00,660
I'm the hash-slinging slasher.

3315
03:42:03,290 --> 03:42:04,360
Oh, Trish.

3316
03:42:04,780 --> 03:42:05,900
My fake mom.

3317
03:42:09,200 --> 03:42:11,180
Do you have my mom's memories now?

3318
03:42:12,560 --> 03:42:13,700
Oh, her hair is so...

3319
03:42:14,780 --> 03:42:15,300
Spaghetti.

3320
03:42:16,100 --> 03:42:17,000
Making me hungry.

3321
03:42:17,620 --> 03:42:19,200
My mother risked her life for me.

3322
03:42:19,980 --> 03:42:20,920
And now you, too.

3323
03:42:26,060 --> 03:42:27,440
Say the line, here it comes.

3324
03:42:28,120 --> 03:42:29,240
I should have saved you.

3325
03:42:34,460 --> 03:42:38,340
I should have been the one to fill your dark soul with light!

3326
03:42:43,180 --> 03:42:44,300
I should have been the one to fill your dark soul with light!

3327
03:42:45,180 --> 03:42:45,840
Why?

3328
03:42:55,000 --> 03:42:56,360
Oh no, Dante!

3329
03:43:04,060 --> 03:43:05,580
This was my mother's.

3330
03:43:07,020 --> 03:43:08,820
Now I'm giving it to you.

3331
03:43:11,260 --> 03:43:14,900
I should have been the one to fill your dark soul with light!

3332
03:43:25,140 --> 03:43:26,600
Rest... in peace.

3333
03:43:36,950 --> 03:43:38,930
Oh my gosh, that'd be...

3334
03:43:40,010 --> 03:43:40,530
Why?

3335
03:43:42,670 --> 03:43:44,290
I have six rorbs.

3336
03:43:44,990 --> 03:43:45,870
Hey, I got a C.

3337
03:43:46,290 --> 03:43:47,490
C's get degrees, baby.

3338
03:43:49,830 --> 03:43:50,890
I should have been the one...

3339
03:43:50,890 --> 03:43:52,910
Sorry, I can't stop quoting it.

3340
03:43:52,950 --> 03:43:53,330
It's so funny.

3341
03:43:53,790 --> 03:43:56,130
I collected 25,000 rorbs!

3342
03:43:58,090 --> 03:44:00,770
Oh my gosh, we're on the final mission, guys!

3343
03:44:03,090 --> 03:44:04,130
Chapter 23.

3344
03:44:04,850 --> 03:44:05,410
Good work.

3345
03:44:05,490 --> 03:44:06,090
Thanks, Ham!

3346
03:44:08,930 --> 03:44:13,070
Oh my gosh, I actually had tears running down my face from laughing at that.

3347
03:44:13,410 --> 03:44:14,310
That's so funny.

3348
03:44:21,180 --> 03:44:21,700
Wait...

3349
03:44:21,700 --> 03:44:22,700
Mother's guide.

3350
03:44:22,920 --> 03:44:25,140
Escape Mallet Island before it collapses!

3351
03:44:27,120 --> 03:44:29,280
Guys, do I need to buy anything here, or...?

3352
03:44:34,380 --> 03:44:35,400
It's time.

3353
03:44:36,020 --> 03:44:36,680
No, just run.

3354
03:44:36,720 --> 03:44:37,100
You're good.

3355
03:44:37,300 --> 03:44:37,560
Okay.

3356
03:44:39,780 --> 03:44:40,380
Okay.

3357
03:44:41,980 --> 03:44:42,860
I need to run.

3358
03:44:44,280 --> 03:44:45,480
Mission start!

3359
03:44:50,780 --> 03:44:52,660
I have five minutes.

3360
03:44:53,700 --> 03:44:53,980
Okay.

3361
03:44:55,400 --> 03:44:57,420
Uh, how do I get out?

3362
03:44:58,420 --> 03:44:59,020
Uh...

3363
03:44:59,020 --> 03:45:00,740
Oh gosh, uh...

3364
03:45:00,740 --> 03:45:03,740
Wait, does someone mention that door to...

3365
03:45:04,080 --> 03:45:05,720
Oh, a door to darkness?

3366
03:45:06,460 --> 03:45:07,100
Oh yes, me.

3367
03:45:07,380 --> 03:45:08,060
Okay, this way?

3368
03:45:11,240 --> 03:45:11,860
Uh...

3369
03:45:12,520 --> 03:45:13,940
Oh shoot, uh...

3370
03:45:13,940 --> 03:45:14,660
Ignore him.

3371
03:45:15,720 --> 03:45:17,020
Uh, wait, it's over here.

3372
03:45:18,500 --> 03:45:19,320
This one.

3373
03:45:20,880 --> 03:45:21,500
Okay.

3374
03:45:23,320 --> 03:45:23,940
Ah!

3375
03:45:24,100 --> 03:45:24,940
DT runs faster.

3376
03:45:25,280 --> 03:45:25,660
We're true!

3377
03:45:28,600 --> 03:45:30,040
Sorry, it's so...

3378
03:45:30,040 --> 03:45:30,640
Wait, come on!

3379
03:45:31,300 --> 03:45:31,660
Please!

3380
03:45:32,120 --> 03:45:32,300
Dante!

3381
03:45:32,780 --> 03:45:33,300
Slice!

3382
03:45:33,760 --> 03:45:35,100
Just slice the thing, Dante!

3383
03:45:35,620 --> 03:45:36,140
Dante!

3384
03:45:36,460 --> 03:45:37,360
Just slice it!

3385
03:45:37,720 --> 03:45:38,020
Dante!

3386
03:45:38,480 --> 03:45:39,440
Wait, can I not?

3387
03:45:40,080 --> 03:45:40,640
Do I have to...

3388
03:45:41,300 --> 03:45:42,020
Oh my god.

3389
03:45:42,100 --> 03:45:43,440
Do I have to beat these guys?

3390
03:45:43,620 --> 03:45:43,760
Oh.

3391
03:45:58,560 --> 03:45:59,460
Oh, no, please.

3392
03:45:59,920 --> 03:46:00,200
Yeah!

3393
03:46:00,640 --> 03:46:01,740
Please, please, Dante.

3394
03:46:01,900 --> 03:46:02,560
You're just taking...

3395
03:46:02,560 --> 03:46:03,520
You're just eating attacks.

3396
03:46:06,500 --> 03:46:08,480
Nice, I got a big ol' orb.

3397
03:46:09,820 --> 03:46:10,220
Please!

3398
03:46:14,180 --> 03:46:14,880
Oh my god.

3399
03:46:15,020 --> 03:46:16,140
I'm not gonna make it, am I?

3400
03:46:19,260 --> 03:46:19,660
Okay.

3401
03:46:19,660 --> 03:46:20,440
All right.

3402
03:46:20,920 --> 03:46:21,900
Open up, please.

3403
03:46:26,240 --> 03:46:27,040
He's dead!

3404
03:46:27,100 --> 03:46:27,720
He's dead!

3405
03:46:30,500 --> 03:46:32,100
I don't care about the raw arms!

3406
03:46:45,170 --> 03:46:47,190
Oh, um, get in there.

3407
03:46:47,610 --> 03:46:48,450
Get in there, Dante.

3408
03:46:48,810 --> 03:46:49,210
Dante.

3409
03:46:49,890 --> 03:46:50,590
Do I just stand?

3410
03:46:52,270 --> 03:46:53,170
Uh, hello?

3411
03:46:54,170 --> 03:46:54,450
Um.

3412
03:46:55,810 --> 03:46:56,590
Uh, guys?

3413
03:46:58,030 --> 03:46:58,510
Examine?

3414
03:46:59,070 --> 03:46:59,770
Oh, there we go.

3415
03:46:59,890 --> 03:47:00,410
Okay, thank you.

3416
03:47:01,170 --> 03:47:03,850
I didn't know the action, but I thought it would be automatic.

3417
03:47:04,370 --> 03:47:05,690
Oh, wrong way, wrong way, wrong way.

3418
03:47:07,110 --> 03:47:07,750
Oh, gosh.

3419
03:47:12,330 --> 03:47:13,230
There we go.

3420
03:47:15,610 --> 03:47:16,630
Slow and steady.

3421
03:47:20,950 --> 03:47:22,830
Escape Mallet Island before it collapses!

3422
03:47:23,150 --> 03:47:24,270
Mission startle!

3423
03:47:25,490 --> 03:47:26,010
Uh...

3424
03:47:26,010 --> 03:47:27,030
Oh, gosh!

3425
03:47:27,750 --> 03:47:28,730
Wait, what the hell?

3426
03:47:29,370 --> 03:47:29,890
Um...

3427
03:47:31,930 --> 03:47:33,110
Oh my god, just go!

3428
03:47:33,270 --> 03:47:33,870
Just leave, Dante!

3429
03:47:44,890 --> 03:47:46,190
I think I'm going the right way.

3430
03:47:47,610 --> 03:47:48,290
Oh, shit.

3431
03:47:48,670 --> 03:47:49,970
You've got to defeat the enemy!

3432
03:47:51,410 --> 03:47:52,250
You bitch!

3433
03:47:52,610 --> 03:47:53,230
Just die!

3434
03:47:54,510 --> 03:47:54,950
Die!

3435
03:47:55,050 --> 03:47:56,230
I gotta get out of here, okay?

3436
03:47:56,870 --> 03:47:57,310
Gosh!

3437
03:48:06,230 --> 03:48:07,110
Grab that.

3438
03:48:07,970 --> 03:48:08,610
Can I leave?

3439
03:48:09,670 --> 03:48:10,450
Can I leave now?

3440
03:48:11,530 --> 03:48:11,890
Okay.

3441
03:48:13,230 --> 03:48:13,590
Nice.

3442
03:48:18,210 --> 03:48:19,470
Now we should be at the entrance.

3443
03:48:20,010 --> 03:48:20,330
Oh, nope.

3444
03:48:20,410 --> 03:48:20,750
Just kidding.

3445
03:48:20,910 --> 03:48:21,890
I don't know where I...

3446
03:48:21,890 --> 03:48:22,330
Oh, no!

3447
03:48:26,070 --> 03:48:26,430
No...

3448
03:48:26,430 --> 03:48:27,810
I'm down here?

3449
03:48:28,510 --> 03:48:30,230
Oh my gosh, they're making us go to every...

3450
03:48:30,230 --> 03:48:31,030
No, why?

3451
03:48:31,490 --> 03:48:31,830
Uh-oh.

3452
03:48:32,470 --> 03:48:32,830
Boss?

3453
03:48:33,750 --> 03:48:34,370
Boss fight?

3454
03:48:35,390 --> 03:48:36,730
Wait, how am I supposed to get out?

3455
03:48:41,550 --> 03:48:42,230
No way.

3456
03:48:42,230 --> 03:48:42,270
Okay.

3457
03:48:45,300 --> 03:48:46,500
Phase three.

3458
03:48:49,040 --> 03:48:50,640
This guy...

3459
03:48:50,640 --> 03:48:51,760
Sucks so much.

3460
03:48:52,460 --> 03:48:53,180
I'm gonna do this again?

3461
03:49:06,860 --> 03:49:11,920
Yeah, look around.

3462
03:49:14,700 --> 03:49:16,360
Oh, yeah, baby!

3463
03:49:16,760 --> 03:49:17,760
Oh my god.

3464
03:49:21,690 --> 03:49:22,790
Oh my god.

3465
03:49:23,310 --> 03:49:23,750
Woo!

3466
03:49:32,470 --> 03:49:33,550
Double trigger, baby.

3467
03:49:35,110 --> 03:49:35,470
Wait.

3468
03:49:36,290 --> 03:49:37,690
I'm not doing any damage all of a sudden.

3469
03:49:38,330 --> 03:49:40,090
Why am I not doing any damage all of a sudden?

3470
03:49:44,490 --> 03:49:44,930
I

3471
03:49:53,980 --> 03:49:55,020
think I'm doing it.

3472
03:49:57,600 --> 03:49:59,420
This texture is so awesome.

3473
03:49:59,820 --> 03:50:00,040
Hello?

3474
03:50:00,420 --> 03:50:01,400
Aren't you supposed to be dead?

3475
03:50:09,010 --> 03:50:10,130
No, it's okay, Dante.

3476
03:50:10,270 --> 03:50:10,770
You got this.

3477
03:50:13,010 --> 03:50:14,530
You'll be okay.

3478
03:50:14,650 --> 03:50:14,970
Mom!

3479
03:50:15,490 --> 03:50:16,490
You can do it.

3480
03:50:16,950 --> 03:50:17,230
What?

3481
03:50:19,350 --> 03:50:19,990
Mother.

3482
03:50:20,450 --> 03:50:21,010
Mother.

3483
03:50:22,150 --> 03:50:22,650
Oh my god.

3484
03:50:33,030 --> 03:50:34,630
Oh my god.

3485
03:50:36,210 --> 03:50:37,490
It's Trish!

3486
03:50:37,850 --> 03:50:38,510
Oh my god.

3487
03:50:40,470 --> 03:50:44,610
Feed your power and Trish's power into your guns, Ebony and Ivory.

3488
03:50:44,710 --> 03:50:47,530
Then use your double trigger and blast a big shot at the Mundus.

3489
03:50:47,990 --> 03:50:48,830
Wait, how do I...

3490
03:50:48,830 --> 03:50:49,010
Wait.

3491
03:50:49,890 --> 03:50:50,290
Okay.

3492
03:50:53,050 --> 03:50:54,890
I can't believe we're going back to...

3493
03:50:54,890 --> 03:50:55,650
Oh, it is all...

3494
03:50:55,650 --> 03:50:56,330
They're already selected.

3495
03:50:56,490 --> 03:50:56,650
Okay.

3496
03:50:58,490 --> 03:50:59,850
Ebony and Ivory, baby!

3497
03:51:08,570 --> 03:51:09,430
Yeah, baby!

3498
03:51:10,470 --> 03:51:11,950
You're sticking licky tongues.

3499
03:51:12,710 --> 03:51:13,390
I don't want...

3500
03:51:13,390 --> 03:51:13,890
I don't want...

3501
03:51:13,890 --> 03:51:15,910
I don't even know if I'm doing anything, to be honest.

3502
03:51:17,930 --> 03:51:18,350
Yeah!

3503
03:51:21,710 --> 03:51:22,350
Double trigger!

3504
03:51:23,770 --> 03:51:25,090
It looks like we have a winner.

3505
03:51:26,250 --> 03:51:26,690
Jackpot.

3506
03:51:41,380 --> 03:51:42,900
I sure hope not.

3507
03:51:48,110 --> 03:51:49,670
See you later, Mundus.

3508
03:51:49,890 --> 03:51:50,210
Goodbye.

3509
03:51:50,870 --> 03:51:54,370
And when you do come back, give my regards to my son, will ya?

3510
03:51:54,890 --> 03:51:55,330
What?

3511
03:51:59,360 --> 03:51:59,800
What?

3512
03:52:00,320 --> 03:52:00,760
What?

3513
03:52:00,780 --> 03:52:01,780
What do you mean by that?

3514
03:52:02,000 --> 03:52:02,440
What?

3515
03:52:05,700 --> 03:52:07,200
What did you mean by that?

3516
03:52:08,180 --> 03:52:08,900
Trish.

3517
03:52:10,260 --> 03:52:11,480
Oh my gosh.

3518
03:52:11,720 --> 03:52:12,820
That's your mom-ish.

3519
03:52:13,960 --> 03:52:15,100
Trish mom-ish.

3520
03:52:17,760 --> 03:52:19,380
What did he mean by that?

3521
03:52:27,200 --> 03:52:28,580
Oh no!

3522
03:52:40,280 --> 03:52:40,800
Oh

3523
03:52:47,640 --> 03:52:47,880
no!

3524
03:52:50,940 --> 03:52:52,440
What does that mean?

3525
03:52:52,960 --> 03:52:53,780
I think...

3526
03:52:53,780 --> 03:52:55,780
I think she means about the building collapsing.

3527
03:52:58,340 --> 03:53:01,120
If only he were like Raiden and he could slice it.

3528
03:53:01,940 --> 03:53:02,540
A plane?

3529
03:53:05,460 --> 03:53:07,100
Wait, do I have to pilot this thing?

3530
03:53:10,640 --> 03:53:11,560
No way.

3531
03:53:14,930 --> 03:53:15,950
Oh my god.

3532
03:53:17,730 --> 03:53:18,530
Oh my god.

3533
03:53:18,530 --> 03:53:19,430
Oh, it fights!

3534
03:53:19,910 --> 03:53:20,970
Oh, it shoots!

3535
03:53:21,670 --> 03:53:22,570
Oh my god.

3536
03:53:24,070 --> 03:53:24,970
Let's rock!

3537
03:53:25,110 --> 03:53:25,770
Let's rock!

3538
03:53:25,890 --> 03:53:26,050
Yeah!

3539
03:53:27,750 --> 03:53:28,710
Oh my gosh.

3540
03:53:30,830 --> 03:53:31,890
Oh, no, no.

3541
03:53:40,750 --> 03:53:42,110
Oh my gosh.

3542
03:53:42,370 --> 03:53:46,170
I feel like I'm in a goddamn Islands of Adventure ride.

3543
03:53:47,030 --> 03:53:48,190
Oops, oops, my bad.

3544
03:53:48,370 --> 03:53:49,650
I thought it would blast it.

3545
03:53:50,290 --> 03:53:53,430
My bad for not realizing that it would work.

3546
03:53:53,930 --> 03:53:55,430
Can I lower myself, please?

3547
03:53:55,650 --> 03:53:57,650
Okay, so the D-pad is also...

3548
03:53:57,650 --> 03:53:58,450
Oh, it is inverted.

3549
03:53:58,550 --> 03:53:59,110
It's not inverted.

3550
03:53:59,250 --> 03:53:59,590
Okay, great.

3551
03:54:00,070 --> 03:54:00,710
Um, I'm just...

3552
03:54:01,430 --> 03:54:02,170
We're fine.

3553
03:54:11,150 --> 03:54:12,790
Yeah, we made it!

3554
03:54:15,780 --> 03:54:16,200
Yeah!

3555
03:54:19,340 --> 03:54:20,760
Oh, we did it!

3556
03:54:25,480 --> 03:54:27,560
Oh, her hair is really long.

3557
03:54:28,660 --> 03:54:29,940
Oh, it's gone now.

3558
03:54:34,280 --> 03:54:35,820
Your voice is so quiet.

3559
03:54:36,880 --> 03:54:37,740
What'd you say, Trish?

3560
03:54:40,700 --> 03:54:42,700
Yeah, so deep.

3561
03:54:46,100 --> 03:54:48,260
We play DMC2, pick Lucia instead.

3562
03:54:49,040 --> 03:54:50,360
Campaign is shorter and less painful.

3563
03:54:50,820 --> 03:54:51,120
Oh, it's it.

3564
03:54:51,220 --> 03:54:51,420
Thank you.

3565
03:54:51,480 --> 03:54:51,920
Thanks, Leon.

3566
03:54:52,040 --> 03:54:52,700
Thanks for the super chat.

3567
03:54:53,420 --> 03:54:54,640
Wow, we did it!

3568
03:54:57,880 --> 03:54:58,620
Yeah.

3569
03:55:12,280 --> 03:55:12,960
Tails!

3570
03:55:19,660 --> 03:55:21,280
Yippee, we did it!

3571
03:55:22,360 --> 03:55:23,300
Devil never cry.

3572
03:55:27,940 --> 03:55:28,580
Wait.

3573
03:55:29,400 --> 03:55:30,900
Wasn't it Devil May Cry before?

3574
03:55:31,020 --> 03:55:31,920
They changed the name, even?

3575
03:55:42,360 --> 03:55:42,540
Woo!

3576
03:55:43,920 --> 03:55:44,700
Five minutes.

3577
03:55:47,500 --> 03:55:47,980
Yay!

3578
03:55:54,500 --> 03:55:56,100
Team Little Devils!

3579
03:55:57,880 --> 03:56:00,280
Oh my gosh, we did it!

3580
03:56:04,800 --> 03:56:06,000
We did it!

3581
03:56:07,680 --> 03:56:10,540
Oh my gosh, we did it so much more quickly than I thought.

3582
03:56:11,000 --> 03:56:13,180
This was supposed to be an endurance stream.

3583
03:56:24,890 --> 03:56:26,490
Why does she have my sword?

3584
03:56:26,950 --> 03:56:29,650
I didn't give you permission to use that, Trish.

3585
03:56:30,490 --> 03:56:32,330
Oh, they're like sword dancing.

3586
03:56:33,110 --> 03:56:34,510
This is so romantic.

3587
03:56:35,090 --> 03:56:36,850
Are they supposed to be romantic?

3588
03:56:36,850 --> 03:56:37,270
So cool.

3589
03:56:38,630 --> 03:56:41,150
Thanks for always filling our dark souls with love.

3590
03:56:45,210 --> 03:56:46,270
Thanks, Dark Raider.

3591
03:56:47,050 --> 03:56:47,930
Not really.

3592
03:56:48,130 --> 03:56:48,910
It's his mom.

3593
03:56:49,690 --> 03:56:50,480
Okay, but like...

3594
03:56:52,550 --> 03:56:53,630
It's not really his mom.

3595
03:56:57,820 --> 03:56:58,640
Thanks, Althezero!

3596
03:56:59,160 --> 03:57:00,080
Thanks for the playthrough.

3597
03:57:03,910 --> 03:57:06,030
I'm gonna be thinking about that all day.

3598
03:57:07,530 --> 03:57:09,770
Packing up with a woman that looks exactly like his mom.

3599
03:57:09,850 --> 03:57:10,810
Truly living the dream.

3600
03:57:11,310 --> 03:57:11,970
I don't...

3601
03:57:11,970 --> 03:57:12,350
I mean...

3602
03:57:14,290 --> 03:57:16,350
He could be a mama's boy.

3603
03:57:16,430 --> 03:57:16,850
We don't know.

3604
03:57:16,910 --> 03:57:18,590
But also, what happened with his brother?

3605
03:57:19,310 --> 03:57:20,550
What happened with Virgil?

3606
03:57:22,990 --> 03:57:24,430
What happened with him?

3607
03:57:26,430 --> 03:57:28,990
So begins the legend of Dante and his demon mom, GF.

3608
03:57:29,070 --> 03:57:29,690
Not blood related.

3609
03:57:30,030 --> 03:57:31,190
Time for DMC3.

3610
03:57:37,560 --> 03:57:38,680
Future games?

3611
03:57:39,960 --> 03:57:40,520
Okay.

3612
03:57:41,100 --> 03:57:42,260
No spoilers, guys.

3613
03:57:42,740 --> 03:57:43,660
I'm just asking.

3614
03:57:44,200 --> 03:57:45,460
But I'm like...

3615
03:57:45,460 --> 03:57:47,220
You know, not wanting an actual answer.

3616
03:57:47,340 --> 03:57:48,060
You have to be like...

3617
03:57:48,060 --> 03:57:50,320
You'll have to play to find out!

3618
03:57:50,420 --> 03:57:50,960
That kind of deal.

3619
03:57:53,200 --> 03:57:55,140
Oedipus is truly too strong.

3620
03:57:55,880 --> 03:58:00,160
Congrats, your reward for clearing DMC1 is to finally understand the response to DMC2.

3621
03:58:00,740 --> 03:58:02,160
After that, it's all uphill from there.

3622
03:58:04,880 --> 03:58:08,440
Oh, the music is so awesome.

3623
03:58:11,060 --> 03:58:12,020
David Keighley.

3624
03:58:18,530 --> 03:58:19,810
Seeds of Love.

3625
03:58:20,050 --> 03:58:20,790
Asawa Spring.

3626
03:58:23,910 --> 03:58:25,590
Uh-oh, new karaoke song.

3627
03:58:31,950 --> 03:58:35,190
From what I understand, this series is also like...

3628
03:58:35,190 --> 03:58:37,470
Out of timeline order, right?

3629
03:58:41,910 --> 03:58:42,550
Dragon!

3630
03:58:42,870 --> 03:58:43,610
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

3631
03:58:44,930 --> 03:58:46,170
Virgil's just chilling.

3632
03:58:51,390 --> 03:58:52,190
Light emoji.

3633
03:58:52,610 --> 03:58:55,530
Dante is one of those video game protagonists who does not know what sex is.

3634
03:58:55,710 --> 03:58:57,250
Okay, I think I get it.

3635
03:59:02,240 --> 03:59:03,780
Three is the first in the story.

3636
03:59:05,100 --> 03:59:06,420
I see, I see, I see.

3637
03:59:08,200 --> 03:59:09,460
First one chronologically.

3638
03:59:14,530 --> 03:59:19,090
If you do not play DMC2, please don't make it not make you play three.

3639
03:59:19,390 --> 03:59:20,130
Three is amazing.

3640
03:59:20,630 --> 03:59:22,630
No, no, I don't think there would ever be...

3641
03:59:22,930 --> 03:59:27,250
You guys, you guys know how patient I am typically with games.

3642
03:59:27,510 --> 03:59:31,170
There's never usually a game that will stop me from playing a series.

3643
03:59:32,010 --> 03:59:33,130
Even if I'll...

3644
03:59:33,130 --> 03:59:35,110
No matter how frustrated I get in a game.

3645
03:59:38,290 --> 03:59:38,890
Yay!

3646
03:59:39,090 --> 03:59:40,910
Finished the game on normal mode!

3647
03:59:41,530 --> 03:59:43,370
Warming up is what it's called.

3648
03:59:44,830 --> 03:59:45,890
What do I get?

3649
03:59:50,580 --> 03:59:52,440
Seeds get degrees, baby.

3650
03:59:55,000 --> 03:59:56,420
The final C.

3651
03:59:57,340 --> 03:59:58,680
Don't worry about it in the series.

3652
03:59:58,780 --> 04:00:00,400
Everyone gets laid, but Dante.

3653
04:00:04,780 --> 04:00:05,980
C for cool.

3654
04:00:08,620 --> 04:00:10,460
The music box is so nice.

3655
04:00:13,260 --> 04:00:15,600
Everybody is so angry about two.

3656
04:00:15,700 --> 04:00:17,780
It makes me just even that much more curious.

3657
04:00:18,280 --> 04:00:19,140
Not gonna lie.

3658
04:00:22,540 --> 04:00:23,460
Oh, wow.

3659
04:00:24,120 --> 04:00:26,600
Oh, I only got two stylish combos.

3660
04:00:26,820 --> 04:00:28,700
I think those were last stream.

3661
04:00:30,040 --> 04:00:32,120
Two tough games beaten in two days.

3662
04:00:32,260 --> 04:00:33,160
Nobody can gout...

3663
04:00:33,160 --> 04:00:33,840
Oh, can gout.

3664
04:00:34,300 --> 04:00:34,920
And doubt.

3665
04:00:35,300 --> 04:00:36,260
Minto is a gamer.

3666
04:00:36,700 --> 04:00:39,220
Also, everybody, please check out her upcoming 3.0 debut.

3667
04:00:39,380 --> 04:00:40,020
Thank you, Marilyn!

3668
04:00:40,280 --> 04:00:41,160
Thanks for the pick!

3669
04:00:42,760 --> 04:00:44,120
Oh, gout.

3670
04:00:46,240 --> 04:00:48,360
I combined gamer and doubt.

3671
04:00:48,920 --> 04:00:50,780
Guys, you know how my brain works, okay?

3672
04:00:51,180 --> 04:00:53,400
You know that I'm always combining words, okay?

3673
04:00:54,140 --> 04:00:58,380
We got 27,000 rorbs.

3674
04:01:00,220 --> 04:01:01,780
Only nine retries.

3675
04:01:03,140 --> 04:01:03,360
What?

3676
04:01:03,580 --> 04:01:04,680
That doesn't seem correct.

3677
04:01:06,120 --> 04:01:07,400
That doesn't seem right.

3678
04:01:08,060 --> 04:01:09,800
I died way more times than that.

3679
04:01:14,290 --> 04:01:16,550
I never got an A, but I got a few Bs.

3680
04:01:17,090 --> 04:01:17,730
It's not bad.

3681
04:01:19,010 --> 04:01:20,810
My average is probably okay.

3682
04:01:22,170 --> 04:01:27,550
People are critical of two because you start the game playing as Dante, but then they pull the rug on you and you play as Raiden.

3683
04:01:28,830 --> 04:01:31,090
You had me in the first half, I'm not gonna lie.

3684
04:01:31,910 --> 04:01:33,210
Oh, the yorbs.

3685
04:01:35,470 --> 04:01:36,650
So many dulls.

3686
04:01:36,910 --> 04:01:37,230
Sorry.

3687
04:01:37,910 --> 04:01:38,950
My combos are lame.

3688
04:01:43,250 --> 04:01:46,610
If you play two, I'll live it through for the first time through you.

3689
04:01:46,950 --> 04:01:49,830
I gave it an hour and was like, yeah, three is really good though.

3690
04:01:50,050 --> 04:01:52,350
Is it just bad gameplay or is it...

3691
04:01:53,930 --> 04:01:55,050
Bad story?

3692
04:01:55,170 --> 04:01:55,730
Bad everything?

3693
04:01:58,210 --> 04:01:59,970
Too stylish is better than some people.

3694
04:02:00,130 --> 04:02:00,750
Thank you.

3695
04:02:01,470 --> 04:02:02,430
It's not fun.

3696
04:02:02,930 --> 04:02:03,870
It's really boring.

3697
04:02:04,310 --> 04:02:05,330
Oh, really?

3698
04:02:07,590 --> 04:02:09,770
Wait, I don't want to stream a boring game.

3699
04:02:13,090 --> 04:02:14,210
Dull presentation.

3700
04:02:14,950 --> 04:02:16,010
Dante barely talks?

3701
04:02:16,110 --> 04:02:17,250
Oh no, it's MGSV.

3702
04:02:19,030 --> 04:02:19,930
It's unfinished?

3703
04:02:20,070 --> 04:02:21,470
Oh no, it's really MGSV.

3704
04:02:24,230 --> 04:02:25,590
It had dev hell.

3705
04:02:25,810 --> 04:02:27,290
Oh, I see.

3706
04:02:31,830 --> 04:02:33,010
I'll consider it.

3707
04:02:33,270 --> 04:02:37,590
I still haven't figured out when I can play the next game yet, so...

3708
04:02:38,250 --> 04:02:39,810
In the meantime, I'll just consider it.

3709
04:02:40,190 --> 04:02:41,430
If you didn't want you to...

3710
04:02:41,430 --> 04:02:45,710
If they didn't want you to stinger combo everything to death, they wouldn't have let you do it five games in a row.

3711
04:02:56,080 --> 04:02:57,540
Drop it if you fall asleep.

3712
04:02:58,940 --> 04:03:00,580
I don't want to play a boring game.

3713
04:03:00,700 --> 04:03:02,220
It's only five hours though.

3714
04:03:02,320 --> 04:03:03,860
Oh, I can beat it in one stream then maybe?

3715
04:03:05,240 --> 04:03:06,660
You should see it for yourself though.

3716
04:03:06,740 --> 04:03:13,360
I feel like if I want to be a true Devil May Cry fan, I need to do everything, you know?

3717
04:03:13,680 --> 04:03:16,920
I also feel that way about Metal Gear.

3718
04:03:17,100 --> 04:03:19,100
I have to play the good, the bad and the ugly.

3719
04:03:22,200 --> 04:03:25,880
I want to not be just a fan of something and then...

3720
04:03:26,440 --> 04:03:27,880
You know, do...

3721
04:03:28,480 --> 04:03:30,520
Not be like, oh, what did you think of 2?

3722
04:03:30,600 --> 04:03:31,660
And I say, oh, I don't know.

3723
04:03:31,720 --> 04:03:33,580
I watch the YouTube videos about it.

3724
04:03:34,160 --> 04:03:34,940
You know what I mean?

3725
04:03:38,040 --> 04:03:40,440
I have to be a real fan of something.

3726
04:03:40,680 --> 04:03:45,580
I have to appreciate and learn every good thing and bad thing about it.

3727
04:03:46,440 --> 04:03:48,020
Play it, but if you get bored, just drop it.

3728
04:03:48,840 --> 04:03:50,720
What if I could beat it in five hours?

3729
04:03:50,840 --> 04:03:52,520
I could just take a day to do it, huh?

3730
04:03:54,640 --> 04:03:56,420
Go challenge the hard mode.

3731
04:03:56,500 --> 04:03:57,300
Okay, shut up, Dante.

3732
04:03:57,540 --> 04:03:58,160
I'm tired.

3733
04:03:59,540 --> 04:03:59,940
Save.

3734
04:04:00,080 --> 04:04:00,860
Yeah, let's save.

3735
04:04:03,040 --> 04:04:03,840
Eight hours.

3736
04:04:05,580 --> 04:04:09,360
Well, I guess that's not so bad for me running around and my first time trying the game.

3737
04:04:09,540 --> 04:04:10,000
Oh, no.

3738
04:04:12,380 --> 04:04:13,420
Yeah, we did it.

3739
04:04:20,720 --> 04:04:22,460
Treated as a footnote in the lore.

3740
04:04:22,520 --> 04:04:24,260
It's not important in the other games.

3741
04:04:26,000 --> 04:04:29,180
You are the strongest MGS fan I've ever seen.

3742
04:04:31,040 --> 04:04:31,980
I think I'm just...

3743
04:04:34,060 --> 04:04:35,280
I think I'm just...

3744
04:04:35,280 --> 04:04:36,360
I'm more tolerant than...

3745
04:04:38,920 --> 04:04:41,640
Like, in certain ways.

3746
04:04:42,080 --> 04:04:45,520
Like, some people will be like, oh, this game was so horrible.

3747
04:04:45,660 --> 04:04:46,820
And I'll be like, oh, it's whatever.

3748
04:04:48,500 --> 04:04:49,000
You know.

3749
04:04:51,080 --> 04:04:53,240
Set the difficulty to easy and speedrun it.

3750
04:04:53,400 --> 04:04:54,800
See if you can get a world record.

3751
04:04:55,200 --> 04:04:56,240
Should we try?

3752
04:04:56,980 --> 04:04:59,320
Wait, I don't know if you can speedrun something, though.

3753
04:04:59,360 --> 04:05:00,260
Your first time.

3754
04:05:04,960 --> 04:05:05,680
Give it a shot.

3755
04:05:06,320 --> 04:05:07,720
Unless it is absolutely extremely...

3756
04:05:09,420 --> 04:05:10,240
Oh my gosh.

3757
04:05:10,420 --> 04:05:13,120
Nicholas, how did your super chat get through when you had a bad word?

3758
04:05:14,020 --> 04:05:14,620
You got this.

3759
04:05:14,680 --> 04:05:15,120
Thank you.

3760
04:05:15,340 --> 04:05:15,880
Devil may cry.

3761
04:05:16,140 --> 04:05:16,920
Devil may cry.

3762
04:05:17,560 --> 04:05:19,540
Can we replay some bad ace combat?

3763
04:05:23,060 --> 04:05:24,800
It really takes a lot...

3764
04:05:24,800 --> 04:05:26,220
Like, if only it's like...

3765
04:05:28,040 --> 04:05:28,560
Real...

3766
04:05:28,560 --> 04:05:29,960
I like how I'm just watching this.

3767
04:05:30,200 --> 04:05:33,000
Slow down, babe.

3768
04:05:33,940 --> 04:05:35,680
I'm just watching this cutscene again.

3769
04:05:35,940 --> 04:05:36,520
So great.

3770
04:05:39,380 --> 04:05:43,000
Uh, it really takes...

3771
04:05:43,000 --> 04:05:43,580
I don't know.

3772
04:05:43,760 --> 04:05:46,900
Some people have asked me, like, what's a really bad game...

3773
04:05:46,900 --> 04:05:48,340
Am I correct?

3774
04:05:49,140 --> 04:05:50,360
And there definitely are some.

3775
04:05:53,140 --> 04:05:55,190
I can't think of anything right now.

3776
04:06:02,640 --> 04:06:04,060
Atla Enesto Nazo.

3777
04:06:04,740 --> 04:06:07,360
But even that, I didn't have...

3778
04:06:07,360 --> 04:06:09,440
It didn't take me as long as I expected.

3779
04:06:12,160 --> 04:06:13,640
You could say my favorite game.

3780
04:06:13,740 --> 04:06:14,320
I can take it.

3781
04:06:17,320 --> 04:06:20,780
In that case, you should be used to this sort of thing.

3782
04:06:20,900 --> 04:06:21,420
Madison?

3783
04:06:26,800 --> 04:06:27,640
Okay, game.

3784
04:06:27,660 --> 04:06:28,360
I'm trying to talk.

3785
04:06:28,680 --> 04:06:29,080
Madison?

3786
04:06:29,360 --> 04:06:30,260
I played Madison.

3787
04:06:31,540 --> 04:06:32,880
I found it...

3788
04:06:32,880 --> 04:06:37,620
I found it spooky up until the very last part of the game.

3789
04:06:41,770 --> 04:06:43,790
I had to force myself to beat the MC two...

3790
04:06:44,330 --> 04:06:45,270
Two times.

3791
04:06:45,350 --> 04:06:46,190
Why did you do that?

3792
04:06:48,390 --> 04:06:49,190
That's so bad.

3793
04:06:52,870 --> 04:06:54,650
I love Ebony and Ivory.

3794
04:06:54,750 --> 04:06:56,290
Let's go, girls!

3795
04:07:01,070 --> 04:07:02,450
Got the platinum trophy.

3796
04:07:02,870 --> 04:07:03,670
You guys are so strong.

3797
04:07:07,340 --> 04:07:08,380
Okay, I'm done.

3798
04:07:09,460 --> 04:07:10,100
I'm done.

3799
04:07:11,000 --> 04:07:11,420
Yay!

3800
04:07:12,040 --> 04:07:13,860
We did it, guys!

3801
04:07:14,580 --> 04:07:15,400
Holy cow.

3802
04:07:15,620 --> 04:07:17,380
Wait, is it just starting the game over for me?

3803
04:07:17,520 --> 04:07:18,580
Wait, is it actually just...

3804
04:07:18,580 --> 04:07:19,000
Oh my god!

3805
04:07:22,660 --> 04:07:23,980
Why am I here?

3806
04:07:39,680 --> 04:07:41,080
I have double jump!

3807
04:07:42,320 --> 04:07:42,760
Wait...

3808
04:07:43,200 --> 04:07:44,760
Do I keep all my stuff?

3809
04:07:45,220 --> 04:07:47,400
There's a Yorb in there and I never knew!

3810
04:07:47,500 --> 04:07:48,420
Oh wait, maybe I did know.

3811
04:07:50,160 --> 04:07:50,860
Oh yeah, I knew.

3812
04:08:01,040 --> 04:08:03,280
Oh my gosh, new game plus is awesome.

3813
04:08:03,840 --> 04:08:07,200
Hahaha, new game plus is amazing!

3814
04:08:08,540 --> 04:08:09,520
Yorb in the tower.

3815
04:08:09,660 --> 04:08:10,220
What tower?

3816
04:08:13,240 --> 04:08:14,200
In there?

3817
04:08:16,660 --> 04:08:18,420
Oh my god, can you guys...

3818
04:08:20,400 --> 04:08:22,520
We're far away so you can barely...

3819
04:08:23,300 --> 04:08:23,960
Listen...

3820
04:08:23,960 --> 04:08:24,610
You can barely...

3821
04:08:26,200 --> 04:08:29,080
You can barely hear his jumps.

3822
04:08:34,920 --> 04:08:35,740
Oh, here.

3823
04:08:42,300 --> 04:08:44,580
I think this is a fine place to leave it.

3824
04:08:44,660 --> 04:08:49,540
Us looking off into the distance while the birds fly and we look at the sunset.

3825
04:08:56,620 --> 04:08:57,920
It's the last day of summer.

3826
04:09:01,980 --> 04:09:05,200
Oh my friends, I haven't been acting it myself.

3827
04:09:05,480 --> 04:09:06,720
I've been having these weird dreams.

3828
04:09:12,340 --> 04:09:15,260
Roxas, I'm eating my sea salt ice cream.

3829
04:09:20,640 --> 04:09:22,360
Feels like MGS.

3830
04:09:23,020 --> 04:09:24,120
Yeah, this is also very...

3831
04:09:24,120 --> 04:09:26,420
Um, how...

3832
04:09:26,420 --> 04:09:29,960
How do I do the music for the...

3833
04:09:31,260 --> 04:09:32,100
That area?

3834
04:09:33,280 --> 04:09:39,320
Wait, I hear it in my head but I can't produce it with my mouth.

3835
04:09:45,340 --> 04:09:47,840
I guess my summer vacation is over.

3836
04:09:49,080 --> 04:09:49,920
Twilight's Night Pink?

3837
04:09:49,980 --> 04:09:52,840
Yeah, that's the one I'm thinking of but I can't make it with my mouth.

3838
04:10:04,800 --> 04:10:10,280
I think the strongest fans can appreciate that the bad games exist and can love the better games more.

3839
04:10:10,540 --> 04:10:14,460
For instance, I loved Resident Evil Orc and Dark Souls 3.

3840
04:10:14,700 --> 04:10:16,320
But I can acknowledge they're not as good.

3841
04:10:16,980 --> 04:10:18,740
Yeah, I respect that.

3842
04:10:19,860 --> 04:10:20,920
Yeah, I respect that.

3843
04:10:22,440 --> 04:10:24,680
I also think like, you know, for the most part...

3844
04:10:26,800 --> 04:10:30,520
Even like, I try to remember that for games...

3845
04:10:31,120 --> 04:10:32,520
One, I can't make a game.

3846
04:10:33,220 --> 04:10:40,120
And I know that for a lot of games they have many factors that go into why they can become bad.

3847
04:10:40,560 --> 04:10:42,780
You know, whether it's like time crunch or...

3848
04:10:45,080 --> 04:10:49,440
Or just all sorts of issues that can arise.

3849
04:10:51,340 --> 04:10:53,700
But you know one thing that's not forgiving?

3850
04:10:54,700 --> 04:10:56,760
Is that damn Uzumaki anime.

3851
04:11:00,520 --> 04:11:02,720
They had five years.

3852
04:11:08,670 --> 04:11:11,030
I'm so... Poor Jujito.

3853
04:11:11,470 --> 04:11:14,250
All of his works just end up so cursed.

3854
04:11:15,250 --> 04:11:19,590
Oh gosh, every episode there's just something that comes out about it.

3855
04:11:19,730 --> 04:11:21,650
And I'm like, god damn it.

3856
04:11:22,670 --> 04:11:24,910
How does it get worse and worse?

3857
04:11:25,430 --> 04:11:27,590
It's now to the point where it's like...

3858
04:11:27,590 --> 04:11:29,010
South Park animation.

3859
04:11:30,610 --> 04:11:32,490
Oh, I meant Dead Space 3.

3860
04:11:33,070 --> 04:11:37,170
Some people were like, wait, Dead Souls 3 is great.

3861
04:11:37,550 --> 04:11:38,510
What are you on about?

3862
04:11:42,150 --> 04:11:43,410
Dead Space.

3863
04:11:45,870 --> 04:11:49,170
Jujito is the epitome of the manga is better.

3864
04:11:49,850 --> 04:11:53,270
But the first episode was great!

3865
04:11:53,770 --> 04:11:54,410
Apparently.

3866
04:11:57,070 --> 04:12:00,130
Reminder that Dante and Raiden appeared in one game together.

3867
04:12:04,600 --> 04:12:05,560
What game?

3868
04:12:13,870 --> 04:12:15,170
This is my money hole.

3869
04:12:15,290 --> 04:12:17,110
It was made for me, studios.

3870
04:12:21,870 --> 04:12:22,910
Wrong Dante.

3871
04:12:23,190 --> 04:12:25,170
Uh-oh, you're making people mad.

3872
04:12:25,270 --> 04:12:26,270
PlayStation All-Stars?

3873
04:12:26,630 --> 04:12:29,070
Oh, I do know that game.

3874
04:12:29,130 --> 04:12:30,230
I do know that game.

3875
04:12:30,890 --> 04:12:33,210
I was thinking of playing it because I have Metal Gear in it.

3876
04:12:33,970 --> 04:12:34,450
Thanks for the donation.

3877
04:12:34,470 --> 04:12:35,570
Streaming on my birthday!

3878
04:12:36,170 --> 04:12:37,550
Honored to share a birthday month with you.

3879
04:12:37,650 --> 04:12:38,630
I can't wait for your re-debut.

3880
04:12:39,010 --> 04:12:40,230
Rusty, thank you!

3881
04:12:40,510 --> 04:12:41,170
Happy birthday!

3882
04:12:43,030 --> 04:12:45,790
Happy birthday to you.

3883
04:12:46,230 --> 04:12:48,690
Happy birthday to you.

3884
04:12:49,110 --> 04:12:53,790
Happy birthday, dear Rusty the Squire.

3885
04:12:54,910 --> 04:12:57,750
Happy birthday to you.

3886
04:12:59,470 --> 04:13:00,510
Happy birthday!

3887
04:13:01,510 --> 04:13:03,650
Well, guys, I think I'll end it there then.

3888
04:13:03,650 --> 04:13:05,790
We can end on a birthday song.

3889
04:13:06,150 --> 04:13:07,530
Thank you guys for...

3890
04:13:07,530 --> 04:13:10,530
I really thought I started this so early in the night.

3891
04:13:10,590 --> 04:13:12,570
Because I was like, I'm going to be going all night, baby.

3892
04:13:12,910 --> 04:13:14,150
Or so early in the day.

3893
04:13:15,050 --> 04:13:15,830
So, sorry.

3894
04:13:16,390 --> 04:13:18,410
Oh, kind of cursed.

3895
04:13:21,870 --> 04:13:26,110
Sorry if it was like at a non-opportune time for you to watch.

3896
04:13:26,210 --> 04:13:29,610
But I hope you enjoyed the finale of Devil May Cry.

3897
04:13:30,270 --> 04:13:33,430
And, well, we'll play Devil May Cry 2.

3898
04:13:33,430 --> 04:13:35,010
I guess eventually sometime.

3899
04:13:35,690 --> 04:13:37,990
If you are like, no, don't play it.

3900
04:13:38,110 --> 04:13:39,510
You just don't have to watch.

3901
04:13:39,590 --> 04:13:40,130
That's all good.

3902
04:13:42,550 --> 04:13:44,610
Or you can wait for Devil May Cry 3.

3903
04:13:44,790 --> 04:13:45,510
No worries.

3904
04:13:45,750 --> 04:13:47,050
All good, all good.

3905
04:13:48,530 --> 04:13:49,690
Is this Blade Runner?

3906
04:13:49,910 --> 04:13:51,450
Gosh, I want to play Blade Runner so bad.

3907
04:13:51,670 --> 04:13:53,010
Can we play Blade Runner?

3908
04:13:54,110 --> 04:13:55,190
Can we play Blade Runner?

3909
04:13:57,390 --> 04:13:59,950
I've been wanting to play that for a long time.

3910
04:14:03,430 --> 04:14:04,110
That's a game?

3911
04:14:04,210 --> 04:14:04,990
Yes, it's...

3912
04:14:04,990 --> 04:14:05,950
Oh my gosh.

3913
04:14:06,250 --> 04:14:08,510
I used to play it with my dad when I was a kid.

3914
04:14:09,390 --> 04:14:10,870
Blade Runner has a game.

3915
04:14:10,950 --> 04:14:12,790
Yes, I used to play it when I was a kid.

3916
04:14:13,330 --> 04:14:14,270
With my dad.

3917
04:14:14,430 --> 04:14:17,030
Well, my dad would play and I would get scared.

3918
04:14:20,790 --> 04:14:24,110
Okay, I'm gonna play it in a couple weeks.

3919
04:14:24,610 --> 04:14:26,630
Okay, okie dokie.

3920
04:14:27,650 --> 04:14:28,830
Okie dokie, everybody.

3921
04:14:29,650 --> 04:14:30,350
Thank you very much.

3922
04:14:31,030 --> 04:14:32,550
Have a great night.

3923
04:14:33,110 --> 04:14:33,770
Or great day.

3924
04:14:34,230 --> 04:14:35,490
Or whatever time it is for you.

3925
04:14:35,890 --> 04:14:37,130
Get some rest.

3926
04:14:37,410 --> 04:14:39,390
Regardless, drink some water.

3927
04:14:39,770 --> 04:14:40,890
Stretch and hydrate.

3928
04:14:41,270 --> 04:14:42,550
All that good stuff.

3929
04:14:43,110 --> 04:14:46,910
And the devil doesn't cry.

3930
04:14:47,630 --> 04:14:47,950
Yeah!

3931
04:14:50,930 --> 04:14:52,790
I think I know that game.

3932
04:14:52,810 --> 04:14:53,630
It was made by Westwood.

3933
04:14:53,710 --> 04:14:54,030
What game?

3934
04:14:54,170 --> 04:14:57,250
Oh, the Blade Runner one?

3935
04:14:57,370 --> 04:14:57,910
I have no...

3936
04:14:57,910 --> 04:14:59,350
I think that sounds familiar.

3937
04:15:00,690 --> 04:15:01,330
Okay.

3938
04:15:01,810 --> 04:15:08,470
I should've been the one to fill your dark soul with light.

3939
04:15:09,310 --> 04:15:09,950
Otsumita!

3940
04:15:12,860 --> 04:15:14,000
Bye, bye, bye, bye.

3941
04:15:14,300 --> 04:15:14,980
See you.

3942
04:15:15,480 --> 04:15:16,160
Bye, bye.
