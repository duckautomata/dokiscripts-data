00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,160
Hello.

2
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,730
Hello.

3
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,450
Welcome back.

4
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,250
We're welcome to Holocure.

5
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,710
This is my, what, third time playing this game on stream?

6
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,410
I think.

7
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,390
I was just watching Astro Vibe Live.

8
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,690
Thank you.

9
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,590
Thank you, thank you.

10
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,130
Oh my gosh.

11
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,550
Josh, thanks for the 10k gift.

12
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,030
Thank you.

13
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:18,070
Today is going to be a bit of a shorter stream because I have a concert later tonight that I will be doing.

14
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,050
Off-Kai off-season.

15
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,310
I'm going to be on a boat.

16
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,930
And I want to... my voice is a little raspy today.

17
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,730
I don't know if it's because I haven't talked much.

18
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,390
I gotta warm it up.

19
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,680
A boat.

20
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,540
Oh my goodness, someone's loud outside.

21
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,840
Too much yapping.

22
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,920
I can't stop yapping.

23
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,400
I can't stop yapping.

24
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,040
More throat drops.

25
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,940
I have a... see, you can hear it, right?

26
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,080
I have some... actually, do I have any cough drops in here?

27
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,520
Let me check.

28
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,160
Kittens, are you guys okay?

29
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,940
Not you guys.

30
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm not calling you guys my kittens.

31
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,860
I'm talking about actual cats.

32
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,980
Don't get it twisted.

33
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,320
Oh, I do have some.

34
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,400
Oh, I have... oh good, I have a throat direct.

35
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,060
One second.

36
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,180
Why is she calling us kittens?

37
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,040
Not you!

38
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,000
Not you!

39
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,140
Oh my god.

40
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,140
I can't look at you right now.

41
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,020
I started the second book last night in the Minotaur Milking Farm series.

42
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:02,560
And the next book is about a lady and she's too horny to think.

43
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,740
That's literally the first line in the book.

44
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,040
She goes, I'm too horny to think.

45
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,940
And I'm like, relatable.

46
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,960
But then she says...

47
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,360
She says...

48
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,720
She goes on like some sort of...

49
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,380
She becomes like an exhibitionist because the Mothman looks at her through her window.

50
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,080
Actually, I'm going to actually use the actual cough drop.

51
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,160
Yeah.

52
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,680
So...

53
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,040
I was listening to this one series.

54
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,700
Well, not really a series, but this is one author.

55
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,020
Oh, for those who don't know, I listen to like romance novels while I'm going to sleep.

56
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,700
They just...

57
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,740
They just...

58
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,480
Drone on, you know?

59
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,880
And they're usually very silly.

60
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,200
But...

61
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,920
There was one recently.

62
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,140
This one lady...

63
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,060
Is like obsessed with like Mafia.

64
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
I don't...

65
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,940
I've never heard this term before.

66
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,500
But she's obsessed with Mafia.

67
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,540
And also the Mafia guy having a surprise baby.

68
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:31,880
So...

69
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,120
And so...

70
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,400
Here, let me just read you...

71
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,980
These are a handful of her books.

72
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,360
Surprise Bratva Daddy.

73
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,780
What is a Bratva?

74
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,340
That's like a Mafia guy, right?

75
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,860
Surprise Bratva Daddy.

76
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,180
Arranged Mafia Daddy.

77
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,360
The Mafia Surprise Baby.

78
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,480
Triplets for the Bratva.

79
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,100
Surprise Baby for the Bratva Voss.

80
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,820
Baby for the Bratva.

81
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,560
I'm seeing a pattern.

82
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,240
Yeah, Bella King is like very specific about what she likes.

83
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,860
She's like, I like mafias and I like surprise babies.

84
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,680
Russian mob fetishes.

85
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,540
It's Russian mob slash gang.

86
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,620
I see.

87
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,240
Okay.

88
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,980
No, I'm not paying for this.

89
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,020
I got it from my library.

90
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:51,800
Thank you.

91
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,900
I'm supporting the local arts.

92
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,800
Oh.

93
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,760
No, sorry.

94
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,420
The Mafia babies are from YouTube.

95
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,140
Anyway.

96
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,580
Welcome.

97
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,480
Back to Holocure.

98
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,800
I've been playing...

99
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,240
I've been trying to farm a lot of coins off stream.

100
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,360
Nico.

101
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,500
Welcome to membership.

102
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,160
Thank you.

103
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,840
Sounds more like smut than romance.

104
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,000
Sorry, I wouldn't have talked about this if I hadn't seen Moe Mothman.

105
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,940
Also, welcome back to membership, Moe Mothman.

106
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,220
So, I've been farming a little bit.

107
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:03,380
I haven't done any more character gacha, but mostly I've just been like using Risu and like eating money.

108
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,860
So I have like some upgrades.

109
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh.

110
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,620
I have some upgrades.

111
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,980
And then I've gotten some more upgrades.

112
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,720
So.

113
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,220
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

114
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,020
Did I do the Russian two wands in those?

115
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,260
Oh.

116
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,880
A lot of times.

117
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,440
Yeah.

118
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,260
Oh yeah.

119
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,000
The only YouTuber I watch that talks about NSFW makes me feel like I'm hearing the weirdest nerd.

120
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,360
Not NSFW.

121
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,260
What do you mean?

122
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,530
Maybe it's because...

123
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,070
I'm a nerd.

124
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,270
We're little freaks.

125
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,130
I don't know.

126
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,030
I got too addicted to fishing.

127
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,170
I haven't fished.

128
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:52,190
I haven't fished because I'm scared of becoming addicted to the fishing.

129
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,150
You know?

130
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,590
Ray?

131
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,590
Ray?

132
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,930
What am I reading?

133
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:00,770
Right?

134
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,430
Ray?

135
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,030
Raylist?

136
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,270
Thank you for the Ray.

137
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,250
Thank you.

138
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,010
Thank you.

139
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,270
Thank you.

140
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:06,750
Hello.

141
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,050
Hi, Raylist.

142
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,590
I'm in phantom.

143
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,110
I'm a ghost mode.

144
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,170
Hello, Mint and Chat.

145
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,870
Finally gathered my confidence to say hi.

146
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:19,410
Hello.

147
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,410
Thank you for saying hi.

148
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,250
Ducky, thanks for the gifted.

149
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,150
Ducky, I see you too.

150
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:27,670
Thanks for the gifted.

151
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,030
Paperbacks, thanks for the five.

152
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:29,650
Gifted.

153
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,430
Hello.

154
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,690
Hello.

155
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:30,910
Hello.

156
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,750
I'm playing Holocure.

157
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,950
I'm still a bit of a Holocure newbie.

158
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,530
There's a...

159
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,030
They've been posting stuff about...

160
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,850
about a new update.

161
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:47,310
I don't know when the new update's gonna... supposed to be, but today my goal is to...

162
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,710
I still haven't...

163
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,210
Here.

164
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:50,830
I'm just gonna...

165
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:55,810
I'm not gonna actually play, but I have not beat the Halloween castle yet.

166
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,230
It's Halloween time.

167
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,590
I must beat Halloween castle.

168
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:06,390
I've just been kind of farming in the holo office over and over again, so expect it around November.

169
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,110
Okay.

170
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,210
Okay.

171
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:07,430
Okay.

172
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:07,770
Awesome.

173
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,990
That gives me plenty of time.

174
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,450
Thank you devs for your hard work.

175
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:13,310
Thank you.

176
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:13,590
Thank you.

177
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:13,890
Thank you.

178
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,450
So...

179
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,290
Um...

180
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,270
It's Halloween.

181
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,370
Max your speed for that one.

182
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:22,770
For this?

183
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,330
Yeah.

184
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:23,890
I've...

185
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,150
I tried it a couple times and I struggled.

186
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,970
I don't remember how...

187
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,630
I think I...

188
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:33,490
I almost beat it one time, but I have not even gotten to the last boss yet.

189
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,530

238
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,640

One second...

240
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,440
He protested!

241
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,460

242
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,380

243
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,560

255
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,040

263
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,100

264
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,540

00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,060
Yeah So I still have a few people Maybe I should...

267
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,740
I know, Kobo is stealthy back there

268
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,460
Yeah...

269
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,820
We're all missing Aqua

270
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,680
Yeah...

271
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,650
Who do you find most enjoyable to play so far?

272
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,090
That's a great question!

273
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:27,250
Well, since I've been mostly just trying to farm money I've been using Risu a lot a lot I've tried...

274
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,910
I'll be honest Like a lot of people I have not played Like...

275
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,150
You can see Um...

276
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,110
Wait, what does that mean?

277
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,150
Why is there like a...

278
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,570
A little trophy down here for some?

279
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,110
I've been...

280
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,170
Number of wins?

281
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,670
Oh, I think it's just regular...

282
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,050
It doesn't count endless then, right?

283
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,830
Because...

284
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,990
I do...

285
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:04,010
I did endless with Risu a lot So...

286
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,670
I have done Sana But like I said...

287
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,150
I've been mostly just playing...

288
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,750
With Risu because I've just been farming So...

289
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:16,430
And...

290
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,150
I wanted to like maybe try new people...

291
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:20,750
On...

292
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,510
Stream...

293
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,110
But it probably is best to like...

294
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,710
Get their fandom up and stuff I don't know...

295
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:31,010
I was trying to like farm and unlock a bunch of stuff...

296
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,050
Off stream so that you know...

297
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,450
On stream I can do like the new things and...

298
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,830
Stuff like that...

299
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:39,510
So...

300
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,050
Maybe...

301
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,230
Maybe I should try unlocking everybody else though...

302
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,690
Let's see if I can unlock everybody else...

303
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,010
Wait...

304
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:47,530
Who was I missing?

305
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,590

00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,870
I don't wanna Spark...

334
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,390

335

Oh my god, what is happening?

336
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,550

Fine.

338
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,340
I don't want to do a ten pull.

339
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,620
I don't want to waste all my money.

340
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:34,680
Okay.

341
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,700

Five pull after.

00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,010
Yeah.

371
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,390
I love how I had no confidence to even get her on the first try.

372
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:21,830
Yippee!

373
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,270

375
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:24,490
Mikochi.

376
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:25,950
No confidence.

377
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,030
I think I have all of Gen 1.

378
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,610
It's a lot of Gen 2 we don't have.

379
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,330
Let's do a five pull and see if we just grab them all in one go.

380
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,530
Ta-da!

381
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,250
Oh!

382
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,270
Oh!

383
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,050
Oh!

384
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,050
Oh!

385
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,450
All

386
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,450
I need is Choco-sensei!

387
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,790
Wait, actually?

388
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:54,690
Yeah!

389
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,290
Yo!

390
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,630
That was so good!

391
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,270
Even the alphas.

392
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,570
That was... Okay, finally.

393
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,330
My luck.

394
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,930
My luck turns around.

395
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,110
Okay, first try.

396
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,210
Who's missing?

397
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:09,770
Just Choco.

398
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,570
Oh, we got regular!

399
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,510
Aqua.

400
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,090
So cute.

401
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,330
So cute.

402
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,110
Aqua again!

403
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,530
Aqua town.

404
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,330
That explains why your Astro Bot gacha luck was so bad.

405
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:30,730
No!

406
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,430
My luck is good.

407
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,110
My luck is good.

408
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,010
My luck is good.

409
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,250
Right?

410
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,270
Oh!

411
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,130
I got the new outfit!

412
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,320
Choco-sensei, now!

413
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,300
Now!

414
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,640
Shubai!

415
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:04,920
Shubai!

416
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,760
Okay, I'll do five again.

417
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,860
And this is the last one we'll do.

418
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,630
I want the other outfit.

419
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,460
Yippee!

420
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,220
Unlock all characters.

421
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,560
Yay!

422
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Now we have everybody.

423
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,620
Oh my gosh, my screen is so full!

424
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,600
It's so beautiful!

425
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,080
Wow!

426
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,560
No!

427
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,220
Oh gosh, I just want to keep farming for more money.

428
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,460
But let's go back and let's do some upgrades.

429
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:17,920
Um...

430
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,100
Oh, that's right.

431
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,180
I wish I had this last run.

432
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,480
Because I was just playing.

433
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,940
And I wanted to do the super collab with the Lamy Water.

434
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,680
But I didn't get the sake.

435
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,120
But I still beat it.

436
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,880
So, you know.

437
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,240
It's my birthday today.

438
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,180
And I just wanted to say thanks for all the happiness you've brought to all of us.

439
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,000
Even though I can't watch live much anymore.

440
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,600
The VODs are still top tier sleep material.

441
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,400
Gomi!

442
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,160
Thank you!

443
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,720
Happy birthday, Gomi!

444
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,740
Happy birthday to you.

445
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,700
Happy birthday to you.

446
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,080
Happy birthday, Moeru Gomi.

447
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,500
Happy birthday to you.

448
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,580
Happy birthday to you.

449
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:12,960
Happy birthday.

450
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:13,980
Thanks for the break.

451
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,280
I was wondering what kind of game you'd want if someone made a fan game.

452
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,180
Oh.

453
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,620
I can't think of ideas.

454
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,460
That aside...

455
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,660
I just want to say...

456
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,820
Thanks for being a red light that helped me get through rough times.

457
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,140
What?

458
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,500
If I had a fan game...

459
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,800
Horror game?

460
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,000
A scary game?

461
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,800
Yeah, maybe.

462
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,880
Maybe a horror game.

463
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,570
Minto, collect 8 pages.

464
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,790
I'm not sure.

465
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:57,870
Poran!

466
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,650
Welcome to membership.

467
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,010
Thank you!

468
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,610
Stealth scary game?

469
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,150
Stealth is already a horror game to me.

470
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,290
Let's see.

471
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,350
What do I want to level up?

472
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,570
What do I want to level up?

473
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,930
Some people were saying speed.

474
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:09,470
I'll do speed.

475
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,810
Let's see.

476
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,690
More money.

477
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,190
More problems.

478
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:17,490
Money?

479
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,100
Money is good.

480
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,200
Money is good.

481
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,900
Ghostly stealth infiltration game.

482
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,480
Haunt slash possess people.

483
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,580
The game writes itself?

484
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,680
That's so true.

485
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,140
Skills up?

486
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,280
Increase the damage of skill.

487
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,700
Yeah, money does speed up the grind.

488
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,480
That's so true.

489
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,820
Right now we're not going to grind so much though.

490
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:51,180
We're going to try new stuff today.

491
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,760
Did you increase the spawn rates?

492
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:05,000
No, I didn't do anything like that because I am still so new to the game.

493
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,600
I'm just a baby.

494
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,140
I'm just a baby.

495
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,560
I'm just a baby.

496
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
I'm just a baby.

497
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,120
I'm just a baby.

498
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,080
I got all of my haste.

499
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,460
So, haste is maxed.

500
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,360
You got them all for now.

501
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,620
What do you mean?

502
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,200
Yeah, I want to try and beat stage three today.

503
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,360
So, that's why I keep like looking at attack.

504
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:33,560
But, I'm going to do more money.

505
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,340
Okay, let's do a skill because it's cheap.

506
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,380
Critical hit is good for the price.

507
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,680
It is very good for the price.

508
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:46,980
Yeah.

509
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,280
Okay.

510
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,380
Psychological more...

511
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,940
You have ghost investigating your own death?

512
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,000
What the hell, that actually sounds so interesting.

513
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,580
You cooked?

514
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,320
You cooked?

515
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,940
I always gravitate the money so I could get the rest faster.

516
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,440
The money won't help us.

517
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,120
Sorry.

518
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:15,440
Fine.

519
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,640
Do I want to do a special cooldown?

520
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,700
Or crit?

521
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,600
I'll do crit.

522
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,480
I was so close to be able to do both.

523
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,760
That is kind of like ghost trick, isn't it?

524
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,880
What's it called?

525
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,500
The detective gets more insane stuff?

526
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,840
That's not so much.

527
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,240
Let's see.

528
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,320
Let's see.

529
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,420
Okay, who do I have that's like a decent... that I've pulled a lot?

530
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,520
Zayda?

531
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,920
G-Rig 7!

532
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:54,740
That's crazy.

533
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,920
Oh my god, she has a pistol!

534
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,260
It is I, chat.

535
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,820
Remember to ignore the game.

536
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,500
Just look at the chat to know where to move, when to ult, and why you died.

537
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,580
Thank you, Paul.

538
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,420
Thank you for the reminder.

539
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,480
Is Zayda...

540
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,380
Would she be good at this?

541
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,480
Turn invisible for 8 seconds.

542
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,560
While invisible, Zayda does not take damage and all targets stop moving towards...

543
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,200
Okay, I'm ulting?

544
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,020
I'm ulting right now?

545
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,060
I'm ulting?

546
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,640
I just ulted?

547
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,220
I died.

548
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,900
Why did I die, chat?

549
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,480
Zayda very good but maybe not for babies.

550
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,760
I'm just a baby.

551
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,140
She's fun but kind of difficult.

552
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,520
I heard that like Okayu is very... where is she?

553
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,280
Oh, Okayu is really difficult too.

554
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,420
Like the onigiri in an arc.

555
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,220
Seems kind of hard to manage.

556
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,800
You've been dead the whole time!

557
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,840
Sui-chan is great if you get axe.

558
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,540
Who would be good for the third stage?

559
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:17,940
Hmm...

560
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,060
Ayame or she?

561
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,660
Slash is twice in front.

562
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,020
Hmm...

563
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,680
Iris is a tank?

564
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,420
Oh, I have her at 5 too!

565
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
Fauna is strong.

566
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,440
I do like playing with Fauna.

567
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,060
You can't die with Fauna.

568
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,480
Need a Metal Gear style game?

569
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,260
But it's just meant haunting a library to read their romance songs?

570
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,560
Sneaking by security.

571
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,120
I have not...

572
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,780
I've played with Iris.

573
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,560
I do not...

574
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,500
When did I play...

575
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,600
When did I beat a game with Iris?

576
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,020
Honestly, I don't remember playing with her at all.

577
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,100
Am I crazy?

578
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,820
I can't decide!

579
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:14,620
I can't decide!

580
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,400
Crazy?

581
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,480
I was crazy once.

582
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,660
Let's try Iris.

583
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,840
Oh, uh...

584
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,660
Okay, I'm just gonna do stage mode.

585
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,080
Since I haven't beaten it.

586
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,040
So let's try.

587
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:29,980
Let's go!

588
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,620
Oh, I do remember a little bit, maybe.

589
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,300
Maybe I'm crazy.

590
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,680
Oh,

591
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,520
there's so many little things.

592
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,500
Um...

593
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,760
Mum, mum, mum.

594
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,840
Hi, Iris.

595
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:51,960
It's Iris.

596
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,580
Magister, welcome back.

597
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,000
Thank you.

598
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,820
Thank you!

599
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,700
I know I am.

600
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,080
I know I am.

601
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,740
I know I am, but what am I?

602
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,620
Wait, what are you?

603
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,120
I made a video for you as your birthday present.

604
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
I posted it on Twitter during your birthday.

605
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,000
Which you didn't see, but I'm at least happy that I sang for you.

606
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,060
And that many people praised me.

607
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,860
Once again, happy birthday, my dear.

608
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,940
Thanks, Raiden!

609
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:18,700
Wait.

610
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,120
I've still been going through the hashtag.

611
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,120
So if I haven't seen it yet, I will get to it.

612
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,040
I mean, I've been...

613
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,920
I've been going through it.

614
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,380
Hope Soda's super good.

615
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,300
It is on theme.

616
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,520
It is very much on theme.

617
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,950
Did you like Jerma's message?

618
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:45,530
Yeah.

619
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,170
That was...

620
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,190
Yeah.

621
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,270
So Critical Hit is important with...

622
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:55,710
With Iris.

623
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,150
Is that what I'm getting from her?

624
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:03,090
Oh my god.

625
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,050
Oh gosh.

626
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,650
You ever have a cough drop and then you take a sip of drink?

627
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:07,490
Cold drink?

628
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:09,670
Okay.

629
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,530
Hope Soda.

630
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,290
Let's try it.

631
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,870
I'll just have it in my arsenal.

632
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:17,610
And again, I'm not going to be focusing on a lot of coin stuff right now.

633
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,170
I'm just...

634
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,770
I'm focusing on survival.

635
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,670
I'm focusing on survival.

636
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,550
Oh, half demon.

637
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,950
These are all skills.

638
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,830
So I can...

639
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,750
They'll...

640
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,870
They'll come to me eventually.

641
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:31,930
Anyway, so...

642
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,730
This is survival round.

643
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:35,570
Survival round.

644
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,150
Oh, and I have like...

645
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:37,910
You know, I've...

646
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,150
I've unlocked some more...

647
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:39,890
Sorry, you can't...

648
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,250
My head...

649
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,810
My big old head's blocking some stuff.

650
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:42,490
But...

651
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,450
Like, I've gotten some more super collab stuff.

652
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,930
So I've been...

653
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,310
Unlocking things.

654
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:52,170
So...

655
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

656
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,630
Like, isn't glow stick an idol song, something?

657
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,010
Yeah.

658
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:58,990
And then you get the Idol costume.

659
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,370
And then it becomes big.

660
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,630
I don't know what I want to go for yet, though.

661
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,570
I don't know what I want to go for yet.

662
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,410
I haven't decided.

663
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:08,770
Hot tone.

664
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:18,970
Yes, you are.

665
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,430
I'm not kidding.

666
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:26,830
I've tried the plushy before, but I don't think... When I've used it, I haven't had like a...

667
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:31,530
I feel like it's probably good with like an uber sheep kind of something going on.

668
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:31,870
Buddy!

669
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:32,590
Welcome back!

670
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,130
Thank you!

671
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,610
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

672
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,230
Idle song.

673
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,050
Paragon, paragon.

674
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,710
It's great with a healer like Fauna.

675
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,430
Let's do half angel since we have half...

676
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,650
We have a half demon.

677
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,630
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

678
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:49,970
I'll take that.

679
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,750
I love knockback.

680
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,930
Not just in the stamp, but like I love knockback.

681
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:58,090
What would your ult be if you were in this?

682
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:58,450
Oh!

683
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:00,770
I don't know.

684
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:01,950
Hmm.

685
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,610
I don't... What would my ult be?

686
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,650
I'm so sorry for being late.

687
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,070
Happy birthday!

688
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,270
Oh, thank you, Magister!

689
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,370
You saucy little maid.

690
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,170
Ectoplasm, maybe... Yeah, maybe I like...

691
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,850
Maybe I like explode ectoplasm or something.

692
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,510
And it pushes back everything around me.

693
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,630
Ectoplasm, busting, busting attack.

694
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:29,290
I'm busting.

695
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:31,890
Yeah.

696
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,850
Dude, let's increase our haste a little bit.

697
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,910
At this stage, I always get stuck on these dang...

698
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:47,170
Dang seeds.

699
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,210
Perish!

700
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,250
Increase soda intake.

701
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:15,790
Also, sorry if I don't listen to chat so much.

702
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,230
I've been just trying to like...

703
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,950
Since I've been playing so much on my own, I've been trying to like learn more stuff.

704
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,970
Um, you know.

705
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:28,210
How much time will you spend at the upcoming USADA casino?

706
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:32,730
I swear, if they put in blackjack, it's over for me.

707
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,050
It's over for me.

708
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:40,110
If they put in blackjack, you guys, I'm never leaving.

709
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,350
I swear.

710
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,210
I don't know.

711
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,330
I'm scared.

712
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:44,890
I'm scared for me.

713
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,690
Do your thing.

714
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:47,790
Thank you.

715
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,530
I might, of course I'll...

716
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:54,230
Of course I'll probably ask for help in certain stuff.

717
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,170
Sometimes.

718
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:56,750
But...

719
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,030
Let's collect.

720
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,150
Collect our riches.

721
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,790
There is blackjack?

722
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,210
K, don't say that!

723
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,270
K, K, don't say that.

724
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:06,370
K, don't do that.

725
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,570
K, don't say that.

726
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,630
Don't say that to me.

727
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:10,530
No.

728
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,270
No, seriously.

729
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,510
Don't lie to me.

730
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:15,950
Don't be like that.

731
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:16,910
Don't get my hopes up.

732
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,590
And also...

733
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,390
Don't do this.

734
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:22,010
K, do you want to create a monster?

735
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,190
We gotta go.

736
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,030
You guys, I have a philosophy in blackjack.

737
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,390
It's called all in, baby.

738
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,170
And it's foolproof.

739
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:35,810
It's foolproof!

740
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:39,770
More soda.

741
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:40,830
Oh!

742
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,970
I was looking at...

743
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,570
Actually, I've never used the Peaky, Peaky, Peamon.

744
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,310
But wouldn't it be good?

745
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,490
Because Iris...

746
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,150
Like, her healing...

747
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,550
Well, I guess this doesn't heal you, technically.

748
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,730
It just gains 15 max HP.

749
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:24,950
I love how there's Peaky, Peaky, Peamon is weak and Peaky, Peaky, Peamon is really strong literally right next to each other.

750
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:28,470
The duality of chat once again.

751
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,910
Oh, it's great with a certain super collab.

752
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,510
It's really good if you're super focused on health.

753
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,450
For now, I...

754
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,890
I will leave it for now.

755
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:53,230
Again, I mean, survival is focused on health, but...

756
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:55,490
Ah...

757
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:57,910
Ah...

758
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,490
Koro-san was sad when chat told her it was weak.

759
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:07,610
No!

760
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,530
You know you want blacksmith, I do.

761
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,470
But we'll keep going with the soda.

762
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:23,790
One thing I also really love to pick up, this might be controversial, I don't know, you guys can tell me, is the...

763
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,030
is the limiter.

764
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,310
Oh my gosh, I did not even see that.

765
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:32,530
I like picking up the limiter real much, cause it...

766
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,070
Oh my goodness.

767
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:37,730
Wow!

768
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,530
My goodness!

769
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,120
Controversial, yeah.

770
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,640
I know, I had a feeling it would be.

771
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,600
I had a feeling it would be.

772
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,940
But then, you know, you get like a kind of build where like...

773
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,240
It's...

774
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,400
Like you just stand in the middle, and then you just... Oh no, not this guy.

775
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,060
Hey!

776
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:06,940
Quit it!

777
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,000
Quit it!

778
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,700
Quit it!

779
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,400
Quit healing!

780
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,060
Quit healing!

781
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,400
Quit it!

782
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:11,980
Quit it!

783
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,020
Quit it!

784
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,020
Quit it!

785
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,520
Okay.

786
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,560
Oh wait!

787
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,180
Oh no, super chat...

788
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:22,320
No!

789
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:22,740
No!

790
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,260
No!

791
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,060
Guys, this is not...

792
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,980
This is not a coin run!

793
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:28,840
Everybody!

794
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:29,900
This is...

795
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,820
This is... This... Stop!

796
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,220
Money!

797
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,600
We need to survive!

798
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,230
I'm greedy.

799
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,950
I'm too greedy!

800
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,710
I'm too greedy.

801
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,050
Big money.

802
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:04,930
Everybody drop money.

803
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:05,790
Drop money.

804
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:06,230
Right now.

805
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:10,950
Who are these little people, guys?

806
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,910
Oh no, guys, I...

807
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,420
Never mind, I lost it.

808
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,340
But money.

809
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,860
Someone said super chat time.

810
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,380
No!

811
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,420
Yeah!

812
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,660
What happened?

813
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,620
The greed.

814
00:41:59,620 --> 00:41:59,640
The greed.

815
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,380
I'm so cool, bro!

816
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,060
Excited for your birthday!

817
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,380
God, that was crazy.

818
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,000
Okay.

819
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:08,860
Anyway.

820
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,460
That was just a practice run.

821
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,540
That was just a practice run, everybody.

822
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,860
Just a little bit of a silly...

823
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,100
Practice run.

824
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,040
Right, everyone!

825
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,080
Right, everyone.

826
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,100
Okay, dropping my... Oh, no.

827
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,300
I didn't make it in time.

828
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
I really like nightly milk.

829
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,740
Cuz it like...

830
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,200
It does so much.

831
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,580
It increases attack size.

832
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,940
It makes the combat...

833
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,520
The knockback, I mean.

834
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,820
And everything like...

835
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,400
I think the milk is pretty good.

836
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,020
I think the milk is pretty good.

837
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,140
Milk in time.

838
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:53,720
Two!

839
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,500
Two!

840
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,920
Thank you!

841
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,920
Did you hear that a lot of people are speculating that a new Ace Combat might release soon?

842
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:09,350
What do you mean by that?

843
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,950
I don't really do the credit cards so much.

844
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:19,510
Because...

845
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,730
I don't really do the credit cards so much because...

846
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,190
I don't know.

847
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,050
Maybe I'm just lucky.

848
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,270
Usually my stuff is already enchanted.

849
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:29,610
So like...

850
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:31,470
I don't know.

851
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:35,530
I know it makes the anvils increase more, which is nice.

852
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:37,510
But...

853
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,450
I don't know.

854
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,770
Oh, no.

855
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:42,510
You said the secret word.

856
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:44,730
You summoned Nan.

857
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,650
Nan, get in here.

858
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:50,250
Oh, there he is.

859
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:50,550
Hahaha.

860
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:57,390
It goes well with Blacksmith.

861
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,130
That, of course, obviously.

862
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,290
Because I mean, you're gonna get the...

863
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:05,510
Holy moly.

864
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:06,950
You're gonna...

865
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,290
Oh, I maybe should have gone...

866
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:08,730
Wait, no.

867
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:11,370
Gorilla's Paw loses the critical crit, right?

868
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,790
It makes your attack stronger, but it makes your crit sad.

869
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:14,290
So...

870
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,310
No, not for Iris.

871
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:17,810
Maybe.

872
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:18,350
Oh!

873
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:23,750
Ouch!

874
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:26,500
Ouch!

875
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,680
I got stuck on the wall.

876
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:29,780
Please...

877
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,240
Please stop it.

878
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,000
Go away.

879
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,880
Gimme burger.

880
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,100
This one's in...

881
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,380
Hmm...

882
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:49,300
This wall in particular always looks like a little area to walk through, so...

883
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,180
Get cabedoned.

884
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,940
Pina Colada!

885
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:53,920
Welcome to the membership.

886
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,340
Thank you!

887
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,740
Let's do this one since it Let's just keep focusing on that for right now.

888
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,180
Survival, survival, survival, everybody.

889
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:04,600
Oh!

890
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:06,680
Oh.

891
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:08,780
Um, upgrade.

892
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,020
I love this adorable TV model.

893
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:12,480
It's so cute.

894
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,400
Thank you!

895
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,320
Me too.

896
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:16,960
Yep.

897
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,240
Thank you, thank you.

898
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,060
Thank you!

899
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,440
Oh my goodness.

900
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,520
Magister, thank you again!

901
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,580
Since you like Metal Gear, you might find an interest in Ace Combat.

902
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,120
Sorry for confusing you.

903
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:27,860
No, I love it!

904
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,300
I love Ace Combat!

905
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,100
If you could do a Super Collab of Among Us or Goose Goose Duck with any 10 other VTubers?

906
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,380
Anyone I want ever?

907
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,960
Anyone I want ever?

908
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:43,780
Oh my goodness.

909
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:51,840
That's hard.

910
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,780
Probably just all my Oshis.

911
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,700
There's like no language barrier.

912
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,040
I do like...

913
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,840
Probably like...

914
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,520
A lot of OGs.

915
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,900
Probably a lot of OGs.

916
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,420
Like Kaguya Luna.

917
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,500
I don't...

918
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,960
You know, thinking about it...

919
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,260
It's like some of these...

920
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:22,580
Some older VTubers back from the heyday.

921
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,080
Like...

922
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,320
We never got to see them play like...

923
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,400
Kind of big collab things like that.

924
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:27,760
You know?

925
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:35,010
It's kind of weird to think about.

926
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:38,270
Like what would Kaguya Luna be like in Among Us?

927
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:39,110
Like what would Kaguya Luna be like in Among Us?

928
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:39,510
Like what would Kaguya Luna be like in Among Us?

929
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:42,150
Like what would Kaguya Luna be like in Among Us?

930
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,390
Rich Evans would collab with you?

931
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:43,970
I hope so.

932
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:45,390
Oh, Himihina!

933
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,710
I would love to play with them too.

934
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,990
Actually, I would love to collab with them like in a song.

935
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:51,890
But they would like...

936
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:52,770
I would just...

937
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:54,850
I would say that, but they would sing so well.

938
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:57,350
And I would be like...

939
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:58,310
Yeah...

940
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:00,630
Yeah...

941
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:03,630
I would be like...

942
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:05,030
Yeah...

943
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:06,890
Yeah...

944
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,110
And they would be like singing so well.

945
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:08,670
I would be like...

946
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:12,730
Oh...

947
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:15,490
Do I want spider cooking?

948
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:17,630
Yeah, I want spider cooking.

949
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:19,250
I feel like that would be good for this.

950
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:21,690
I feel like maybe...

951
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:24,190
I might do like the uber sheep...

952
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,290
I might do like the uber sheep...

953
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:26,090
super collab...

954
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,610
going on with...

955
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:29,730
going on with...

956
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:33,010
Wow!

957
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:33,810
Virgil!

958
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:35,470
Thank you for the birthday gift!

959
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:36,530
Thank you so much!

960
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:43,530
Thank you for the birthday gift!

961
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:43,570
Thank you for the birthday gift!

962
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:44,630
Saura!

963
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,340
Spider...

964
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,060
You get the Miko bucket and then you get...

965
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,300
Let's do this one too.

966
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,660
Let's just start grabbing some...

967
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,040
of my skills.

968
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,480
La la la...

969
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,160
All the bats are coming.

970
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,000
Here come the bats.

971
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,420
How...

972
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,500
How am I healing sometimes?

973
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:22,960
Wow!

974
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,360
Nice.

975
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:31,380
Oh.

976
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:34,740
Kylidos!

977
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,660
Back in the membership.

978
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:36,560
Thank you, Reimu.

979
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,920
Hakurei Reimu.

980
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:47,940
Hakurei Reimu.

981
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,320
No!

982
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,540
Go away!

983
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,760
Go away!

984
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,000
Go away, you freak!

985
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,220
Go away!

986
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:58,940
Go away!

987
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:02,440
I know that name.

988
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:04,780
Do you?

989
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,580
Do you know Hakurei Reimu?

990
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,920
Let's keep doing soda.

991
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:15,300
Let's keep doing soda.

992
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,400
Even though I can't even have it.

993
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,320
There was like a...

994
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:24,900
Sometimes...

995
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,920
Actually, this past Japan trip...

996
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,740
For some reason, I went to so many birthday events.

997
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,100
For some reason, I went to so many birthday events.

998
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,500
For like different idols and maids and stuff.

999
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,240
And usually at the birthday events...

1000
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:37,960
They'll have like...

1001
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,240
A custom cocktail you can order.

1002
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,200
But I always...

1003
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,420
And they usually have like either a non-alcohol or an alcohol version.

1004
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,320
And...

1005
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,780
But I always have to tell them...

1006
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,620
No carbonation.

1007
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,700
I'm more of a Suika connoisseur.

1008
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,580
Jose, welcome back!

1009
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,800
And Musou, welcome to membership 2!

1010
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,920
Let's see...

1011
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,600
Horn is nice.

1012
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,320
I really like a horn.

1013
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:06,900
I do.

1014
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:09,180
Okay.

1015
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,120
Survival, everybody.

1016
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:12,820
Survival.

1017
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,000
This is all about survival.

1018
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,100
This is all about survival.

1019
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,960
It's all about survival this time, baby.

1020
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,240
This is how I died before.

1021
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:25,780
Oh my goodness.

1022
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,820
No little apple.

1023
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,620
Did I ask before what the apple...

1024
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:43,860
Mascots are?

1025
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,920
I don't recognize them.

1026
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:48,980
Nice.

1027
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,060
Let's just level up our skill.

1028
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,580
Oh, Aki!

1029
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:58,100
Yes!

1030
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:58,600
Okay.

1031
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,110
There's Aki's fans.

1032
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:06,090
What do they call them?

1033
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:07,630
Oh, Nozetai.

1034
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:08,350
Mmm!

1035
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:19,210
They're so cute!

1036
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:23,790
They're little robot apples.

1037
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:26,590
Is it the Japanese version?

1038
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:28,810
Oh, oh my goodness.

1039
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:34,330
Do I have the Japanese version on my list for Ace Combat?

1040
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:36,330
Um...

1041
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,550
Oh my gosh.

1042
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:38,690
Yes?

1043
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:41,590
I own it.

1044
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:43,910
So...

1045
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:44,330
Um...

1046
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,810
And I believe there are like...

1047
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:51,350
Translations and stuff, right?

1048
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:52,250
So...

1049
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:54,830
I own...

1050
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:56,930
I can't remember.

1051
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:59,110
I think I'm missing one Ace Combat game.

1052
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:01,630
But I own...

1053
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:04,730
Most of them now.

1054
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:08,530
I own many.

1055
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,970
I go to like...

1056
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:13,670
What's it called?

1057
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:15,770
Retro game stores.

1058
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:17,750
And search.

1059
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:23,330
Wow!

1060
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:24,470
Oh!

1061
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:27,150
No!

1062
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,330
Let's do more spider.

1063
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,950
Oh my goodness.

1064
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,710
May I please get a burger?

1065
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:44,670
Okay.

1066
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:44,790
Does...

1067
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:47,670
How does Iris self heal?

1068
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:48,690
Is it just normal?

1069
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:49,450
Like this shit?

1070
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,650
Rain of spiders.

1071
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:53,590
Except they're bats.

1072
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,230
Oh, she heals on crits.

1073
00:52:58,330 --> 00:52:59,110
Oh, that's right!

1074
00:52:59,350 --> 00:52:59,670
Okay.

1075
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:01,910
That's the skill that...

1076
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:02,750
Okay, okay, okay.

1077
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:03,910
I see, I see.

1078
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:09,190
So having like a lot of enemies...

1079
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:10,530
Around is good.

1080
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:13,550
More chances to...

1081
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,450
I need something that like...

1082
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:19,910
Cause her attack is...

1083
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:20,850
Pretty like...

1084
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:22,410
Focused, you know?

1085
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,290
Oh my goodness.

1086
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:26,010
I need something that also can...

1087
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:27,710
Get...

1088
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:30,410
From behind, you know?

1089
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,060
I need to...

1090
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,020
Focus on that too.

1091
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:45,610
Yeah...

1092
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:52,250
I mean, I have spider cooking...

1093
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:53,690
But it's not enough, obviously.

1094
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:57,750
Yeah...

1095
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:58,790
Oh...

1096
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:00,910
I just wished for that...

1097
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:02,330
And I literally got cutting board...

1098
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:03,030
But...

1099
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:07,090
That's not really...

1100
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,290
It wouldn't really work for Iris, right?

1101
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:13,370
You can use your ult for coverage.

1102
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,710
Oh yeah, I forgot I had that.

1103
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:21,450
For now though...

1104
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:22,070
I wanna...

1105
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:23,610
I wanna see if I can get like...

1106
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:24,350
Maybe...

1107
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:27,550
Maybe BL book...

1108
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:28,410
Plus...

1109
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:29,610
The axe.

1110
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:32,270
What does her ult do?

1111
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:32,750
Oh!

1112
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:36,470
Oh!

1113
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:37,450
BL book!

1114
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:40,210
Yeah, I don't think Iris is very bored.

1115
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:40,690
Hahaha.

1116
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:48,380
...

1117
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:48,660
...

1118
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,160
Ahem...

1119
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,180
Limiter, my beloved.

1120
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:53,640
Me too!

1121
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:54,620
But...

1122
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,740
I will go with BL book, actually.

1123
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,320
Maybe controversial.

1124
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,280
...

1125
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:12,530
But I went with it anyway.

1126
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:13,970
...

1127
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:16,090
Maybe slightly controversial.

1128
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:18,190
...

1129
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:19,330
Ah!

1130
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:25,950
Where are my stabs?

1131
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,470
When am I gonna get any stabs?

1132
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:28,590
...

1133
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,860
It's good on even boing characters?

1134
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:36,400
Really?

1135
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,200
...

1136
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,540
I don't know what...

1137
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,380
What collabs you can get with it either.

1138
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,200
...

1139
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:48,340
Ugh...

1140
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:56,330
Chill out.

1141
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:57,670
Chill out, everybody.

1142
00:55:58,010 --> 00:55:58,590
Chill out.

1143
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:00,630
Oh my goodness, this is not a good position to...

1144
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:01,670
...be in.

1145
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:03,770
Oh my goodness.

1146
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:04,430
Oh!

1147
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:05,810
I got one.

1148
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:06,310
Finally.

1149
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:09,490
Board plus bomb.

1150
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:10,330
...

1151
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:14,390
Maybe we can try it if I get it.

1152
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:14,910
Oh!

1153
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:15,750
I got the...

1154
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:16,250
...

1155
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:16,390
...

1156
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:20,230
Shoot.

1157
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:23,290
...

1158
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:23,950
...

1159
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,680
I think I killed him.

1160
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:43,700
...

1161
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,960
I'm powerful now.

1162
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:47,660
...

1163
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:47,840
Oh!

1164
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:48,340
Oh!

1165
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:48,880
Oh!

1166
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:49,840
...

1167
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,020
...

1168
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,220
We're almost...

1169
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,420
We've almost maxed this one out.

1170
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:16,020
Oh my gosh.

1171
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:16,780
I keep getting stuck.

1172
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,760
This is so bad.

1173
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:18,320
...

1174
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,160
Holy moly.

1175
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:22,860
Holy moly.

1176
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:23,880
I thought I was gonna die there.

1177
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,420
I thought I was gonna die there for sure.

1178
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:27,300
...

1179
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:30,600
Emulation for translation.

1180
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:32,420
... Yes!

1181
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,020
I did know that.

1182
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,140
For the translation.

1183
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:34,820
...

1184
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,260
Don't worry.

1185
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,120
I've looked into stuff.

1186
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:38,720
...

1187
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:40,700
I have.

1188
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:40,980
I have.

1189
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,280
...

1190
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,320
Let's go with the BL book.

1191
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:48,300
...

1192
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,760
I'm gonna upgrade this as well.

1193
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,360
Get this up a little bit.

1194
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,340
BL maxing.

1195
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:55,560
Yes.

1196
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,000
...

1197
00:57:58,940 --> 00:57:59,960
BL book, my beloved.

1198
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,440
...

1199
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:04,330
Oh gosh.

1200
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:06,290
Oh gosh.

1201
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:07,610
Oh gosh.

1202
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:08,670
Oh gosh.

1203
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:08,990
...

1204
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:12,170
We're fine.

1205
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,350
We're fine, everybody.

1206
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:14,890
We're all good.

1207
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:15,670
Oh!

1208
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:16,570
Money, money, money!

1209
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:18,090
Knockback!

1210
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,150
... Are you winning, Minto?

1211
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:22,510
...

1212
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:27,830
Chat, am I winning?

1213
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:28,950
...

1214
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:30,690
...

1215
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:37,150
Let's collect my riches.

1216
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:37,610
...

1217
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,030
...

1218
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:42,710
...

1219
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:43,010
...

1220
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:46,050
Let's go with what we've got.

1221
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:48,110
Let's focus on increasing what we've got.

1222
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:49,570
Winning at life?

1223
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:51,210
You mean afterlife.

1224
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:52,710
...

1225
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,900
Winning at afterlife, baby.

1226
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,080
...

1227
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,400
What do you mean minus two?

1228
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,620
I'm literally dead!

1229
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:17,870
I'm not liv- There is no life!

1230
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:18,310
...

1231
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:21,230
I've lived my life!

1232
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:24,130
And now I'm living an afterlife!

1233
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:26,190
What do you want from me?

1234
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:26,970
...

1235
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,210
What do you want from me?

1236
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:31,030
...

1237
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:35,030
Why is everything that I'm trying not to get...

1238
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:35,350
...

1239
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:36,050
...

1240
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:40,270
Oh no!

1241
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:40,830
...

1242
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:46,630
Oh my gosh!

1243
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:47,330
Oh my gosh!

1244
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:51,750
I could've ulted probably there, but...

1245
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:58,490
Gosh, they're fast.

1246
00:59:59,750 --> 00:59:59,790
...

1247
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,000
No!

1248
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:12,400
...

1249
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:12,960
...

1250
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:22,560
...

1251
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:27,300
...

1252
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:27,680
...

1253
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,360
...

1254
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:30,000
Yeah?

1255
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,020
And I'm very skilled, okay?

1256
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:37,680
What do you want from me?

1257
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:38,880
...

1258
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:43,370
Oh, come on.

1259
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:47,670
I like how it's still stuck around.

1260
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:49,290
...

1261
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:50,510
What do you want from me?

1262
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:51,890
...

1263
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:54,890
I need a question and answer that has plagued me for a while.

1264
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:55,710
Why are you so cute?

1265
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:56,650
...

1266
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:57,870
What do you...

1267
01:00:58,330 --> 01:00:59,930
This is not the time!

1268
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:02,190
...

1269
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:04,270
...

1270
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:07,350
Oh, X a potato.

1271
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,270
I have wanted to do...

1272
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,390
Wait, isn't X potato?

1273
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:12,510
...

1274
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:15,210
No, it's not lava.

1275
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:18,090
There's another one that you can do the X potato.

1276
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:20,210
I've never... Obviously I've never done it before though.

1277
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:22,290
...

1278
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:22,550
...

1279
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:25,870
Oh, the bomb, right?

1280
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:26,350
The bomb.

1281
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,080
I gotta focus on...

1282
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,560
I have my BL book though.

1283
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,860
I gotta get something with the BL book.

1284
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:42,100
...

1285
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,820
Thank you!

1286
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,100
Thanks Elias!

1287
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:47,900
...

1288
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:51,080
X potato with idol song really is the best one.

1289
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:52,140
...

1290
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,380
But we don't have a guarantee I'll get idol song again.

1291
01:01:58,780 --> 01:01:59,300
...

1292
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:00,620
...

1293
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:01,900
We could get BL...

1294
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:02,240
...

1295
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:07,450
Oh, I'll do that and then...

1296
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:07,770
...

1297
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:12,230
Just go for bucket.

1298
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:13,310
Yeah, I'm not on endless.

1299
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:16,050
If I were on endless, I would probably...

1300
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:18,550
Yeah....

1301
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:20,690
I forgot I'm not on endless.

1302
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:21,510
Oh my gosh.

1303
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:25,750
Follow your heart.

1304
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:27,930
It's a bucket.

1305
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:29,010
...

1306
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:29,470
...

1307
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:34,950
Right now we are doing okay though.

1308
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:36,990
Right now we're doing A-OK.

1309
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:41,390
The axe!

1310
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:45,330
Let's just focus on this.

1311
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:00,390
I don't think I'll ever get to the Super Collab, but that's OK.

1312
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:05,930
I even never get to the Super Collab.

1313
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:06,590
Stop it!

1314
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:07,630
Stop!

1315
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:09,910
Stop healing!

1316
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:11,070
Thank you.

1317
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:12,910
Love you.

1318
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:17,030
Is every pain you feel by definition a phantom pain?

1319
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:21,550
I'm mental!

1320
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,600
Phantom pain.

1321
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,620
Gosh, I...

1322
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,660
Kinda can't wait to play it again.

1323
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:37,200
It's gonna be so funny when Mint Phantom plays...

1324
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:49,760
OK.

1325
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,680
I guess I'll... I guess I have to.

1326
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,080
I guess I have to.

1327
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,140
Nightly milk!

1328
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:05,480
I forgot that I had that.

1329
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:08,320
Oh my god, look how many more coins there are.

1330
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:08,820
Yippee!

1331
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,440
Keep it up, Mint!

1332
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,040
Thank you!

1333
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,280
Thanks Renegade!

1334
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,520
Happy Halloween, everybody!

1335
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:23,480
Oh my gosh, what are you looking... are you looking forward to doing anything in Halloween?

1336
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:25,760
Last year!

1337
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:26,840
It's so funny.

1338
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,800
It's kinda maybe like silly for a ghost to go ghost hunting, but it's also kinda fun...

1339
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,120
Oh my goodness.

1340
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:33,300
To see...

1341
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,180
It's funny to like see them try and be like, ghost, can you hear me?

1342
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,260
And I'm the ghost.

1343
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,440
But I wanna go ghost hunting.

1344
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,600
I went last year with my friends, ghost hunting.

1345
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,060
I wanna go again this year too.

1346
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,400
I should've picked up the limiter.

1347
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:52,940
I swear.

1348
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,300
Or super chatto time or something.

1349
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,380
Oh wait, I don't think I've gotten super chatto time.

1350
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:58,600
What a trickster.

1351
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,320
I know, they're like, ghost, can you hear me?

1352
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:01,080
And I'm like...

1353
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:04,000
Maybe?

1354
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:06,880
No, I shouldn't though.

1355
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,820
I must be responsible.

1356
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:16,720
Can I get super chatto time, please?

1357
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,700
Look how many coins there are, you guys.

1358
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,280
Let's go.

1359
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,980
Oh, I'm starting to get cornered a little bit.

1360
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,920
I'm starting to get cornered a little bit.

1361
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:45,710
It's okay, we can just run in circles.

1362
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:48,370
We run in circles.

1363
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:49,330
Wow!

1364
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:51,550
My riches!

1365
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:52,970
My riches!

1366
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:55,190
I don't think I've ever gotten greed.

1367
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:58,550
Thank you for the hunker stuff!

1368
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:00,130
Thank you so much.

1369
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:04,930
I don't think I've ever gotten greed without having super chatto time.

1370
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:06,770
So I'm like...

1371
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:12,110
So it's kind of funny, because usually all the coins come to me.

1372
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:13,250
You know?

1373
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:20,490
Yay!

1374
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:21,790
Thank you for the tech gift!

1375
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:22,510
Thank you so much!

1376
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:22,790
Thank you!

1377
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:23,010
Thank you!

1378
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:23,190
Thank you!

1379
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:23,670
Thank you!

1380
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:24,370
Thank you!

1381
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:24,550
Thank you!

1382
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:24,790
Thank you!

1383
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:25,310
Thank you!

1384
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:26,470
Thank you!

1385
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:27,450
Thank you!

1386
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:27,850
Thank you!

1387
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:27,950
Thank you!

1388
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:28,150
Thank you!

1389
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:28,530
Thank you!

1390
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:32,950
This area is so dangerous.

1391
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:34,250
Ouchy ouch!

1392
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:39,590
Oh no.

1393
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:40,430
Uh oh.

1394
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:41,650
Uh oh.

1395
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:42,550
No, no, no, no, no.

1396
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:45,910
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1397
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:04,220
Ubersheep, baby!

1398
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:12,300
Thanks for the coin!

1399
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:15,780
Nice.

1400
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,000
Alrighty.

1401
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:20,520
Alright.

1402
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:22,800
You and you.

1403
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:25,900
Okay.

1404
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:33,450
Let's collect our riches.

1405
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:35,770
Let's collect our riches.

1406
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:38,270
While we have a little bit of downtime.

1407
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:41,290
And max this out.

1408
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:47,670
So that we can get the uber sheep super collab.

1409
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:49,610
Ouch!

1410
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:52,990
Thank you.

1411
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:56,170
Nice.

1412
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:58,250
Oh shoot.

1413
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:02,030
Yeah, getting the hang of things little by little.

1414
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:04,050
I don't know everything.

1415
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:07,750
I don't know all the best combinations.

1416
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:10,250
Everything like that.

1417
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:13,610
Little by little we get there.

1418
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:16,710
I play as I play.

1419
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:21,650
Stop hurling!

1420
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:23,310
Stop healing!

1421
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:38,910
I think I'm gonna reroll.

1422
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:41,390
What?

1423
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:44,010
You know what?

1424
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:45,810
Everybody said the cutting board.

1425
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:47,430
I'll try cutting board.

1426
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:52,510
I've gotten...

1427
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:53,210
What's the cutting board?

1428
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:55,630
The one where it like falls down from the sky.

1429
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:04,760
Flattening board.

1430
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:06,200
Yeah, the bomb and the board.

1431
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,240
The birds, the bees.

1432
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:17,230
Oh my goodness.

1433
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:19,250
Gosh.

1434
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:21,250
How do we live?

1435
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:22,570
How do we live?

1436
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:23,430
I don't know.

1437
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:25,530
We're doing good.

1438
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:29,920
Oh my gosh.

1439
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,180
No, no, no, no.

1440
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:31,740
Please.

1441
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:33,200
Please.

1442
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:37,380
I want to live.

1443
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:38,940
Even though I'm dead.

1444
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:39,460
I want to live.

1445
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:43,530
Cutting board.

1446
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:44,010
Two.

1447
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:47,390
Yeah, healing saved us.

1448
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:51,820
Let's see.

1449
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:52,980
What do we get?

1450
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:55,120
Wow, I'm not getting very lucky on these boxes.

1451
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:00,920
Oh.

1452
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,000
Ubershape.

1453
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:03,580
Ubershape.

1454
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,280
Good, good, good, good.

1455
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:11,600
The higher we get Ubershape, the sooner we can get our...

1456
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:16,840
Oh, who is toho danmaku ami?

1457
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,060
Oh, these guys.

1458
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:20,120
Stop!

1459
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,120
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

1460
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:23,400
I'm not ready!

1461
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:25,320
Oh!

1462
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,040
I could get the bomb.

1463
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:29,740
Hmm.

1464
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:40,810
Oh yeah, I'm at 17.

1465
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:42,170
Let's do this.

1466
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:45,850
Let's do the... the nightly meltdown.

1467
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:56,860
I don't want to deal with this anymore!

1468
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:05,790
Oh my god.

1469
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:06,970
Oh my god.

1470
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:08,750
Where's my mouse?

1471
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:09,070
There it is.

1472
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:21,400
Her healing really does go crazy.

1473
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,100
Oh my gosh.

1474
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,300
I say that as I'm literally dying.

1475
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:26,760
It is quite good though.

1476
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:29,760
Oh my god.

1477
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,060
Don't do that.

1478
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:31,920
Please.

1479
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,400
Oh my gosh.

1480
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:33,760
Please.

1481
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:34,460
Please.

1482
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:35,980
Oh, I walked right into it.

1483
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,660
Stop shooting at me!

1484
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,040
Okay.

1485
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:50,340
I'm gonna just keep going with Ubersheep, guys.

1486
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:52,360
We're gonna try for the ultra collab.

1487
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:54,140
We're gonna try for the ultra collab.

1488
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:59,340
The big collab, baby.

1489
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,800
What's your favorite... I asked.

1490
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,120
I was gonna say, I'm not gonna be able to read this but I'm not gonna be able to read it.

1491
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:09,540
I ask you questions and I'm like, I can't read it though.

1492
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:11,000
I can't read.

1493
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:15,400
I was gonna say what's your favorite, like, Ultra collab, but I can't even read it so...

1494
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,800
Don't tell me until I can read.

1495
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:20,460
Where's my mouse?

1496
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:20,720
There it is.

1497
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:25,570
Stop.

1498
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:35,440
Please.

1499
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:35,940
Please.

1500
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:37,560
Please.

1501
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:38,920
Please.

1502
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:39,000
Please!

1503
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:40,640
Please!

1504
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:41,380
Please!

1505
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:46,540
Asakoko plus beam?

1506
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:47,440
No, no, no.

1507
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:49,320
These ones.

1508
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:50,220
The big ones.

1509
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:56,100
My ghost she can't read.

1510
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,640
The Idol Show one?

1511
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:01,540
This one?

1512
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,840
Gorilla Pod plus Dragonfire.

1513
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:07,480
I haven't gotten that one.

1514
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:10,920
Fascinating.

1515
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,600
Thank you for your information.

1516
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:15,380
Please!

1517
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:15,980
Please!

1518
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:16,800
Please!

1519
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,000
Live Iris!

1520
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:19,760
Live Iris!

1521
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,100
Sounds like a disease, but it's not.

1522
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:24,940
It's important.

1523
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,120
Don't die Iris!

1524
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:40,640
There we go.

1525
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,520
That sounds way more natural.

1526
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:48,020
That sounds way more natural than Live Iris.

1527
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:57,870
What was I trying to upgrade?

1528
01:13:58,170 --> 01:13:59,890
Oh, I can't.

1529
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:00,990
Okay, now...

1530
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:02,830
Give me...

1531
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:04,250
Give me...

1532
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:06,550
Give me Gold Anvil.

1533
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,680
Give me Gold Anvil.

1534
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:17,040
I guess I could have enchanted, huh?

1535
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:19,840
I'm used to enchanting...

1536
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:21,080
Like...

1537
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,560
Later in the...

1538
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,540
You know...

1539
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:36,940
Yippee!

1540
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,720
Oh my god!

1541
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,220
I'm gonna die everybody.

1542
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:43,880
Sayonara world!

1543
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:45,180
Actually, I'm alive.

1544
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:45,860
Just kidding.

1545
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:55,060
That was so close.

1546
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,480
That was actually...

1547
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:00,080
That was actually so close.

1548
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:01,740
Holy cow.

1549
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:02,280
Oh my god.

1550
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:03,360
Run Iris!

1551
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:03,840
Run!

1552
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:06,060
Wait!

1553
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:08,380
You guys, this is the furthest I've ever gotten.

1554
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:10,660
A Damaku.

1555
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,100
A Damaku!

1556
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,260
I'm collecting my riches.

1557
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,800
She just does a Damaku kind of similar to Ei-chan.

1558
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:36,280
Okay, I probably should like...

1559
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:38,000
Attack her at some point, you know?

1560
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:39,420
Run Iris!

1561
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:39,500
Run Iris!

1562
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:42,220
Go go go!

1563
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:45,400
Guys!

1564
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,340
Guys, I think we've got this.

1565
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:48,100
Why am I talking?

1566
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:48,880
Don't speak.

1567
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:50,120
Minthe, you idiot!

1568
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:50,900
Don't open your mouth.

1569
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:51,780
Don't have confidence.

1570
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:52,980
Don't speak!

1571
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,740
Don't speak.

1572
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,640
You're gonna jinx yourself.

1573
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:00,760
And that'll be really sad.

1574
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,660
Oh my god.

1575
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,280
Uh-oh.

1576
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:05,840
Guys, we're in trouble.

1577
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:07,320
Guys, we're in so much trouble.

1578
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:07,880
Guys.

1579
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:08,680
Guys, we're in trouble.

1580
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:09,380
Guys.

1581
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:09,740
Guys, we're in trouble.

1582
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:10,800
Oh, never mind, we're okay.

1583
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,360
We were in trouble.

1584
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:15,160
I wasn't lying.

1585
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,220
We were definitely in trouble.

1586
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,680
We were definitely in trouble, but it was also okay.

1587
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,000
Dang, Iris really is tanky, isn't she?

1588
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:28,840
That's kind of awesome.

1589
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,680
The screams are so funny.

1590
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:36,400
Let's go Iris!

1591
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:45,380
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

1592
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:47,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

1593
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:50,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

1594
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:57,500
I'm just running around in circles.

1595
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:07,820
We did it!

1596
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:08,160
Wow.

1597
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:11,940
I, I, I...

1598
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,260
Now what do I do?

1599
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:22,380
Hey Mint!

1600
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,800
Why did you spell my name like that?

1601
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,800
I got a raise, so here's my tax.

1602
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,520
Please use it to improve our housing.

1603
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:28,860
It's getting crowded and smelly.

1604
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:35,580
Ian's curse!

1605
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,200
Fires cursed energy in front.

1606
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,680
On hit, there's a chance to spread another curse.

1607
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:46,640
Stage 4?

1608
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:50,880
Hold on, I'm just going to pick someone random.

1609
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:55,860
Stage 4... is...

1610
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:00,400
Wait, is there anything after stage 4?

1611
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:12,000
Hard mode.

1612
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,420
Yeah, I knew there were hard stages.

1613
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:22,690
Hard stages 1 through 3.

1614
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:26,810
I heard that hard stage...

1615
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:31,870
3... no.

1616
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:32,610
Yeah, 3.

1617
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:34,290
You fight...

1618
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:37,250
You fight small myth, is that true?

1619
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:48,510
Shop, shop, shop, shop, shop, shop, shop, shop!

1620
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:51,310
I don't have enough for money.

1621
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:55,010
But, I can do...

1622
01:18:58,390 --> 01:19:00,950
Maybe I can just finish out crit?

1623
01:19:03,490 --> 01:19:05,010
Congrats on completing stage 3!

1624
01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:05,350
Yeah!

1625
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,390
It was surreal watching you fight Tarantula.

1626
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:09,370
Well, I have Hatchaman the next time.

1627
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:09,530
Haha.

1628
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:11,850
Nice.

1629
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:18,390
You guys, my haste is all the way up.

1630
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:19,750
Why do you guys keep saying...

1631
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,890
Why do you guys keep saying, do more haste.

1632
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:23,470
My haste is all...

1633
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:25,110
I can't do anymore haste.

1634
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:30,930
My haste is all the way up.

1635
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:34,690
Get more haste, download more haste.

1636
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:36,570
I'm downloading?

1637
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:37,230
I'm downloading?

1638
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:37,610
Downloading?

1639
01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:51,420
I got it from this place called the... the... the Senchou Bay.

1640
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,800
Now I have a virus.

1641
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:17,400
Let's see... part of me wants to just buy the cheap ones just so I can finish them.

1642
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,140
But the cooldown is pretty good.

1643
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:22,780
I can finish it.

1644
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,480
I just want to complete stuff, you know?

1645
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:27,920
It's like the completionist just makes me want to be like...

1646
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,400
But then I can focus on other things, you know?

1647
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,940
It will be crossed off.

1648
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:35,440
It's like crossing off something on your list and you don't have to look at it anymore, you know?

1649
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:36,620
Complete it!

1650
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:36,940
Okay.

1651
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:41,300
All I needed was one person in chat to say, complete it.

1652
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:42,200
And I say, okay.

1653
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,280
Do more haste.

1654
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:50,920
Let's see.

1655
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:51,980
I want the Gacha.

1656
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:56,680
Let's do it in Council.

1657
01:20:56,980 --> 01:21:05,800
Because I feel like Fana, Mumei, Sana are like three characters that... I do.

1658
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:06,740
You know?

1659
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:15,300
Am I missing any?

1660
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:15,920
Nope!

1661
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,420
I got all of them.

1662
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:19,780
I have all the characters.

1663
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:26,340
I have not done the no movement challenge because it scares me.

1664
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,360
I have quite a lot of achievements that I have not done.

1665
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:32,720
Let's see.

1666
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:34,620
Quite a bit.

1667
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:35,880
What's this?

1668
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:38,540
Clear stage without having any character skills.

1669
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:39,340
Fandom walk.

1670
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:42,680
Choose the haste stat up option ten times when leveling up.

1671
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:43,980
Oh, maybe I should try with that.

1672
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:48,760
I finally got 100% achievements the other day.

1673
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:49,300
Let's go.

1674
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:50,560
You're gaming?

1675
01:21:58,530 --> 01:21:59,570
More haste.

1676
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:00,130
Haste.

1677
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:00,530
Haste.

1678
01:22:00,610 --> 01:22:00,970
Oh my gosh!

1679
01:22:00,970 --> 01:22:02,490
We have to do this one.

1680
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:05,530
We have to do this because it's the... We have to haste!

1681
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:08,170
We have to haste!

1682
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:12,630
Some said... Is it true Fana is good?

1683
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:17,690
Complete special objectives as fast as possible.

1684
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:25,110
Is she good on this stage?

1685
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:28,730
Fana is great for no move as well?

1686
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:29,210
Oh, really?

1687
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:31,270
Let's try it.

1688
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:36,670
Wait, what if I don't move?

1689
01:22:39,610 --> 01:22:40,790
How do I get stuff though?

1690
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:42,570
Okay, never mind.

1691
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:43,190
I don't like it.

1692
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:45,850
I'm too wiggly, you guys.

1693
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:47,650
No movement challenge.

1694
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:48,730
I'm too wiggly, okay?

1695
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:49,830
I'm too wiggly.

1696
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:50,450
I can't do it.

1697
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:52,650
Too wiggly.

1698
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:55,450
Literally impossible for me, okay?

1699
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:57,610
Impossible.

1700
01:22:57,790 --> 01:22:58,150
Impossible.

1701
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:00,750
It lasted 2 seconds.

1702
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:03,950
Oh, the glasses.

1703
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:05,890
Oh, I should have gotten the glasses.

1704
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:06,690
Oh my gosh!

1705
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:08,790
Glasses on first pull would have been so good!

1706
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:10,130
I'm a fool.

1707
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:10,630
I'm a fool.

1708
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:11,770
I got the glasses!

1709
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:22,070
Yeah, Fana's ult is very good too.

1710
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:22,610
So true.

1711
01:23:25,890 --> 01:23:26,510
Streamer luck.

1712
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:34,430
Xion can do the no movement and Crony the no damage.

1713
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:36,290
Oh, okay.

1714
01:23:40,610 --> 01:23:42,190
Is it... wait...

1715
01:23:42,190 --> 01:23:45,370
There's someone who gets buffs from moving around a lot.

1716
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:45,950
Who is it?

1717
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:54,400
Kiara!

1718
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:54,980
That's right.

1719
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:55,680
Kiwawa.

1720
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:57,800
Kiwawa.

1721
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:58,920
Kiwawa, my beloved.

1722
01:24:04,830 --> 01:24:05,630
Stay away.

1723
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:09,490
Kiwawa.

1724
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:11,930
Kiwawa.

1725
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:18,690
I need more haste.

1726
01:24:19,410 --> 01:24:20,050
Okay, guys.

1727
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:23,590
If there's haste, we're going to try for the haste.

1728
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:26,290
We're going to try for haste challenge.

1729
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:28,790
I don't know if we'll complete this.

1730
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:30,750
I don't know if we'll actually beat this stage.

1731
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:32,570
Like if we'll get to the third stage.

1732
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:34,390
It's going to take 30 minutes, but we shall try.

1733
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:37,170
Obviously.

1734
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:38,810
Actually, no.

1735
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:39,530
I'm just going to die.

1736
01:24:42,130 --> 01:24:43,090
I'm just going to die.

1737
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:03,530
Am I an idiot?

1738
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:03,970
Maybe.

1739
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:06,810
I might be stupid.

1740
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:09,430
Ka-ching!

1741
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:10,830
Super Cha-Cha time!

1742
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:16,480
Oh my gosh.

1743
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:18,380
That was close.

1744
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:20,840
That was so close.

1745
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:23,600
Super Cha-Cha time!

1746
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,020
Thank you guys for all the Super Chats.

1747
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:26,800
I really appreciate it.

1748
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:29,280
Thank you.

1749
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:37,900
I want to do really only this stage today because Halloween time.

1750
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:41,600
Whisper, whisper, whisper.

1751
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,380
Oh, hello.

1752
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:48,980
Give me a second.

1753
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,540
Let's see what we get from here first.

1754
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:59,100
Was that Peko's laugh in the background of the music?

1755
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:02,300
I just heard it.

1756
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:03,260
I've never heard it.

1757
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:04,040
I've never heard it before.

1758
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:07,720
It is.

1759
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:09,100
That's so funny.

1760
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:13,560
I only heard it when I went to this menu.

1761
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:21,240
I now have the urge to play and hoard coins for the next update.

1762
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,060
That's what I'm saying.

1763
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:23,620
I'm trying to get ready for the next update.

1764
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:25,640
Super Cha-Cha time!

1765
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:29,460
Thank you, Tri-Princess.

1766
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:32,280
Super Cha-Cha time.

1767
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:33,400
Thank you, Star-G.

1768
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:34,820
Let's see.

1769
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,620
I'm going to...

1770
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:39,880
Let's get our shield up first.

1771
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:40,580
Oh, yeah.

1772
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:41,160
Let's do this.

1773
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,760
Super Cha-Cha time.

1774
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:48,700
I'll take it, baby.

1775
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:52,240
And upgrade my shield.

1776
01:26:57,110 --> 01:26:57,910
We're zooming.

1777
01:26:58,310 --> 01:26:59,190
We're zooming.

1778
01:26:59,490 --> 01:27:00,330
We're zooming.

1779
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:02,890
And awakened.

1780
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,600
Did that say miss?

1781
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:10,840
Miss.

1782
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:11,620
Miss.

1783
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,720
That's my favorite sticker to use.

1784
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:14,940
In Mario Party.

1785
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:15,860
Miss.

1786
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:16,800
Miss.

1787
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,160
We're zooming.

1788
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:19,680
We're zooming.

1789
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:23,060
We're Newman.

1790
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:26,020
Let's do Guardian Tree.

1791
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:29,020
Yeah, there we go.

1792
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:29,920
There we go.

1793
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,300
Now we're Fauna.

1794
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,720
Now we're Fauna-ing.

1795
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:36,400
Oh, this chomp.

1796
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:37,460
Get out of here!

1797
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:38,740
Get out of here!

1798
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:40,760
No!

1799
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,100
I thought I killed you.

1800
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:45,670
There we go.

1801
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:47,190
A Yoshi sticker.

1802
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:49,030
Miss.

1803
01:27:49,450 --> 01:27:50,050
Oh!

1804
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:50,590
Oh!

1805
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:50,950
Oh!

1806
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:51,490
Flower.

1807
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,160
We're oo-ing now.

1808
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:00,240
Flower.

1809
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:05,440
Okay, what do I want to...

1810
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:08,420
We should probably start planning what kind of, like, collabs we want, right?

1811
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:09,580
Hmm.

1812
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:15,200
Maybe I will try for the, um...

1813
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:16,920
Flower.

1814
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:17,640
For the big...

1815
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:20,900
Or...

1816
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:21,800
Uh, what was it?

1817
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:22,460
Um...

1818
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:23,800
This with the...

1819
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,180
With the gorilla paw, right?

1820
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:28,140
All healing?

1821
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:33,650
Dragon's Breath plus gorilla paw.

1822
01:28:34,290 --> 01:28:36,970
I haven't gotten that one before, so I actually want to try it.

1823
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:37,990
So let's see if we can get it.

1824
01:28:40,610 --> 01:28:41,770
Let's see if we can go for it.

1825
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:51,340
I'm not zooming anymore.

1826
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:52,280
So sad.

1827
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:52,420
I'm not zooming anymore.

1828
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:57,910
Oh, she does damage when healing.

1829
01:28:58,230 --> 01:29:00,330
Oh, yeah, because of the tree branches.

1830
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:01,310
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

1831
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:02,690
I get it.

1832
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:03,070
I get it.

1833
01:29:04,070 --> 01:29:04,510
Hmm...

1834
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:07,670
True.

1835
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:10,050
True, true, true, true, true.

1836
01:29:11,290 --> 01:29:11,730
Hmm...

1837
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,820
I was thinking about the cooldown one.

1838
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:31,360
I'm not going to lie.

1839
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:36,120
Uh, the idol outfit for the cooldown.

1840
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:36,760
Okay.

1841
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:37,740
Okay.

1842
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:42,320
What's a good one?

1843
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:43,220
Oh, oh, wait.

1844
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:44,480
Um, what's it called then?

1845
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,820
The uber sheep would be so good then, right?

1846
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:48,680
Oh, hello.

1847
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:52,740
The uber sheep, like, ultra collab would be so good for Rufana then.

1848
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:57,620
The horn too.

1849
01:29:57,740 --> 01:29:58,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1850
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:00,840
Maybe I should...

1851
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,200
Oh, but I want to try new stuff.

1852
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:03,300
Maybe I should rethink.

1853
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:04,880
Okay.

1854
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,320
Oh, we have this anyway, so we can at least...

1855
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:11,260
Uh...

1856
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:12,040
Oh!

1857
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:12,980
Uber sheep!

1858
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:14,340
Perfect.

1859
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:15,280
Hahaha.

1860
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:17,280
Uh,

1861
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,100
a question for anybody that knows.

1862
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:34,900
If I get the limiter, will it help me pick up these little saplings better?

1863
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:38,420
Any healing item helps, yeah.

1864
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:42,720
No?

1865
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:44,960
Wait, some say yes.

1866
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:45,260
No?

1867
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:50,250
Oh, spider cooking!

1868
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:51,190
So we need spider cooking.

1869
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:52,410
We need lava.

1870
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:58,090
And we are on endless, so we have a little bit more time to...

1871
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:02,500
For stuff.

1872
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,160
For any additional things.

1873
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:10,350
Oh yeah, we're cooking.

1874
01:31:10,510 --> 01:31:11,310
Oh yeah, we're cooking.

1875
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:13,510
Ah!

1876
01:31:14,490 --> 01:31:15,190
Let's get the...

1877
01:31:15,190 --> 01:31:15,430
Let's...

1878
01:31:15,430 --> 01:31:17,290
I think five is the max for the glasses.

1879
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:17,590
Oh!

1880
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:19,330
For the glasses, right?

1881
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:19,830
So...

1882
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:21,550
I'll just, uh...

1883
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:26,290
Asakoko injection is good for Rufana too.

1884
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,120
If you don't pick them up, they'll come to you anyway.

1885
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:32,620
Oh, really?

1886
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:46,300
I think Mento's mentality on how she plays is affecting my brain.

1887
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:46,960
What do you mean by that?

1888
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,960
I run characters that just die as I walk past them.

1889
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:50,860
Wait, what do you mean?

1890
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:54,880
What do you mean?

1891
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:57,160
What do you mean?

1892
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:00,700
Die!

1893
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:01,420
Die!

1894
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:01,500
Die!

1895
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:01,880
Die!

1896
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,420
Die.

1897
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:03,080
Die!

1898
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:04,060
Die!

1899
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:06,320
Die to the healer!

1900
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,160
Die to the healer!

1901
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:10,820
Oh!

1902
01:32:14,870 --> 01:32:16,450
Guys, we have the set up!

1903
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:19,210
We have the set up!

1904
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:24,000
Nice!

1905
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:31,840
You could ult.

1906
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:32,460
I could!

1907
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,220
But I don't need to.

1908
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:38,380
I don't need to!

1909
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:38,920
I don't need to!

1910
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,860
Please give me like a little triple box, please.

1911
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:43,960
Triple box, please.

1912
01:32:50,010 --> 01:32:50,790
She's cracked.

1913
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:55,630
I think this is like the most setup I've ever been in like a game.

1914
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,780
Wait, what makes my attack by horns?

1915
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:03,680
Oh, horns plus full...

1916
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:04,620
Oh, full meal?

1917
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:05,360
Oh my gosh.

1918
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:06,600
Hell yeah.

1919
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:08,120
If I can get horns...

1920
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:08,940
Unless I missed it.

1921
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:09,740
If I did, my bad.

1922
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:11,000
Wait, what's this?

1923
01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:12,860
Oh, just kidding.

1924
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:14,840
I saw the burger on top of it and...

1925
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:21,040
It looked like something new and exciting.

1926
01:33:24,770 --> 01:33:26,250
I should probably...

1927
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:28,770
I can't decide what to...

1928
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:29,950
What to level up, you guys.

1929
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:31,730
Can't decide, okay?

1930
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:34,690
Look how many more little saplings we got.

1931
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:45,100
Full...

1932
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:48,560
Full heal!

1933
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:51,640
Full meal wouldn't really help with the attack.

1934
01:33:51,980 --> 01:33:53,520
But it would help with like, you know...

1935
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,400
Because Fauna heals so much...

1936
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:56,800
All the healing would be...

1937
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:00,120
Like super intense healing, you know?

1938
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:01,420
Basically.

1939
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,340
So it's not that it would like...

1940
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:05,020
Help me fight more.

1941
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,120
It would just keep me alive longer.

1942
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:09,620
Which is probably...

1943
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:12,280
Good against all the Yagos at the end.

1944
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:15,000
She becomes invincible!

1945
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:16,100
Burning... right?

1946
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:17,860
Oh...

1947
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:24,460
A super shape.

1948
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,180
Let's get this up.

1949
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:28,260
I know I need to get my buckets and everything too.

1950
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:31,240
I really want to get the Ultra Collab as much...

1951
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:31,920
As soon as I can.

1952
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:34,380
Miss!

1953
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:35,680
Miss!

1954
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:36,280
Miss!

1955
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:38,260
Miss!

1956
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:38,760
Miss!

1957
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:55,670
Sparkle King!

1958
01:34:57,450 --> 01:34:58,990
What should we do with our...

1959
01:34:58,990 --> 01:35:00,510
With our tail?

1960
01:35:02,170 --> 01:35:02,910
What kind of...

1961
01:35:02,910 --> 01:35:04,550
What collab should we go with for it?

1962
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:04,810
I wonder.

1963
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:21,000
Oh, do flame?

1964
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:21,900
Maybe.

1965
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:25,840
We're not going to go with the...

1966
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,940
We're doing an Ubersheep Ultra Collab.

1967
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:28,800
So we're not going to...

1968
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:29,740
Okay, here we go.

1969
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:34,340
Now I...

1970
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:36,660
Leave me alone!

1971
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:39,120
Get out of my tree!

1972
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:41,040
Get out of my tree!

1973
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:47,860
I haven't unlocked the sausage yet.

1974
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:49,200
How do I unlock it?

1975
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:53,460
Game!

1976
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:54,540
You are so good!

1977
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:56,980
You are so good!

1978
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:06,420
Is it by chance or do I play a certain character?

1979
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:15,760
Now it's just...

1980
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:18,020
Getting the guys that we need.

1981
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:22,260
Miss!

1982
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:22,840
Miss!

1983
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:23,560
Miss!

1984
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:24,700
Miss!

1985
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:29,220
Gotta beat stage 4.

1986
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:29,500
Ah!

1987
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:29,540
Ah!

1988
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:33,860
You guys, I just beat stage...

1989
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:34,380
Oh, money!

1990
01:36:34,980 --> 01:36:36,660
I just beat stage 3 today!

1991
01:36:36,980 --> 01:36:37,740
Give me a break!

1992
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:40,120
Give me a break!

1993
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:42,300
I

1994
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:47,610
like the...

1995
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:48,870
The marking stamp.

1996
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:58,080
You're doing great, Minto.

1997
01:36:58,260 --> 01:36:58,840
Thank you!

1998
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:00,040
Replace flower?

1999
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:01,540
That's exactly what I was about to do.

2000
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:08,000
That is exactly what I was about to do.

2001
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,720
You read my mind!

2002
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:10,840
Are you Minto?

2003
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:13,300
Would you like to become Minto?

2004
01:37:17,950 --> 01:37:18,470
No!

2005
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:20,850
No!

2006
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:23,370
No!

2007
01:37:23,790 --> 01:37:24,310
Yes!

2008
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:35,380
Am I Minto?

2009
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:36,860
I don't think so.

2010
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:41,480
You guys may be wisps...

2011
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:42,580
But I want you to stay alive.

2012
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:48,880
As Naomi Hunter would say...

2013
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:49,460
Live.

2014
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:50,920
Just live.

2015
01:37:53,010 --> 01:37:53,960
Just live.

2016
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:05,920
But for how long, Minto?

2017
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:06,500
But for how long, Minto?

2018
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:08,060
Just live.

2019
01:38:13,310 --> 01:38:15,970
I like this one a lot!

2020
01:38:17,330 --> 01:38:17,850
Usually...

2021
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,050
Okay, like my...

2022
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:21,310
I usually go with the attack up stamp.

2023
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:23,470
I go with the Usa Bomb.

2024
01:38:23,770 --> 01:38:25,610
And then I go with Crony...

2025
01:38:25,610 --> 01:38:26,470
Crony Haste.

2026
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:33,470
I like having the size up...

2027
01:38:33,470 --> 01:38:35,270
But I'll switch it out.

2028
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:40,670
And I'm gonna max this.

2029
01:38:43,010 --> 01:38:45,230
Size increase isn't that big on Fauna.

2030
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:46,650
That's fair.

2031
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:47,810
You know what?

2032
01:38:47,810 --> 01:38:48,290
That's so fair.

2033
01:38:48,410 --> 01:38:48,510
Oh!

2034
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:50,430
Hello!

2035
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:53,870
Fauna is fast, I noticed.

2036
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:56,870
Well, I guess it's because of my... nevermind.

2037
01:38:57,010 --> 01:38:57,910
It's because I have...

2038
01:38:57,910 --> 01:39:00,510
The stats up because I'm healing.

2039
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:06,350
I have the effects on.

2040
01:39:07,330 --> 01:39:08,910
I'm taking the...

2041
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:11,690
I'm taking the good stuff.

2042
01:39:12,010 --> 01:39:13,470
I'm taking the sapling stuff.

2043
01:39:14,510 --> 01:39:15,650
The green stuff.

2044
01:39:16,570 --> 01:39:17,690
Let's go, green girls!

2045
01:39:17,850 --> 01:39:18,770
Let's go, green girls!

2046
01:39:23,110 --> 01:39:23,550
Oh!

2047
01:39:23,570 --> 01:39:24,090
What the...

2048
01:39:26,330 --> 01:39:26,990
More... Oh!

2049
01:39:27,050 --> 01:39:27,470
You guys!

2050
01:39:27,730 --> 01:39:29,650
I completely forgot about the haste challenge.

2051
01:39:32,370 --> 01:39:32,810
I...

2052
01:39:32,810 --> 01:39:35,590
Did you notice that I forgot about the haste challenge, you guys?

2053
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:38,510
I completely forgot about the haste challenge.

2054
01:39:39,090 --> 01:39:39,530
Oopsie.

2055
01:39:41,070 --> 01:39:41,950
Not bad.

2056
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:44,390
Oopsie.

2057
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:47,070
Oh, we did it!

2058
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:48,810
Guys, I forgot!

2059
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:50,170
Uh-oh.

2060
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:56,350
I'm like, I'm gonna do this challenge.

2061
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:56,890
I'm like, I'm gonna do this challenge.

2062
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,900
No haste bonuses were there though.

2063
01:40:02,980 --> 01:40:03,000
No haste bonuses were there though.

2064
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:03,220
Oh, really?

2065
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:04,900
Okay, good.

2066
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:06,020
Because I was not looking.

2067
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,140
Okay, good.

2068
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:09,140
Because I was not looking.

2069
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:11,000
I didn't even look a single time.

2070
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:15,220
Should I enchant?

2071
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:24,440
Should I enchant?

2072
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:25,200
No, it's really hard to.

2073
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:30,940
Um...

2074
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:32,380
Uh...

2075
01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:33,220
Oh, here we go.

2076
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:35,120
Thank you!

2077
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,580
Alright, now we have to wait...

2078
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:39,920
until level 50?

2079
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:41,060
Aw, Mayim.

2080
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,160
I'm gonna hold on to that...

2081
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:47,440
anvil for now.

2082
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:52,130
Chant is good.

2083
01:40:52,350 --> 01:40:52,870
You know what?

2084
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:53,750
I lied.

2085
01:40:53,930 --> 01:40:54,490
Let's enchant.

2086
01:40:54,490 --> 01:40:54,650
Man.

2087
01:40:59,050 --> 01:40:59,930
Hit rate.

2088
01:41:01,070 --> 01:41:02,350
RIP double enchant.

2089
01:41:02,490 --> 01:41:02,830
It's okay.

2090
01:41:05,030 --> 01:41:06,850
It's all good.

2091
01:41:07,930 --> 01:41:09,650
It's all good.

2092
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:10,710
It's all good.

2093
01:41:10,710 --> 01:41:11,210
No worries.

2094
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:13,690
It's all good.

2095
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:16,630
What was I going for?

2096
01:41:23,060 --> 01:41:25,040
I could do the bomb.

2097
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:28,460
I could do the bomb.

2098
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:29,580
Now we can still enchant uber sheep.

2099
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:29,940
So true.

2100
01:41:35,390 --> 01:41:36,030
Do the bomb.

2101
01:41:36,710 --> 01:41:37,810
You're the bomb.

2102
01:41:44,740 --> 01:41:45,660
You're the bomb.

2103
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:47,720
Oh,

2104
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:54,640
Oscar.

2105
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:55,280
Stop.

2106
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,020
Oh, Oscar.

2107
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:05,780
Guys, did you see that they're making a live action Rugrats?

2108
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:09,500
Except the Rugrat babies are all gonna be in 3D.

2109
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:14,620
And I think negative people on this planet Earth have asked for this.

2110
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,520
Negative people want the Rugrats live action movie.

2111
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:19,060
I swear.

2112
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:23,420
Nobody wants this.

2113
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:24,940
Why is it happening?

2114
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:29,660
It's gonna look so awful and terrible.

2115
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:31,840
Minto, take that back.

2116
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:32,480
I can't.

2117
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:33,020
I can't.

2118
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,160
If I learn this, you also have to learn this.

2119
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:37,120
I'm sorry.

2120
01:42:41,310 --> 01:42:42,610
Nobody wants this.

2121
01:42:42,650 --> 01:42:43,570
Negative people.

2122
01:42:45,110 --> 01:42:49,050
I used to watch Rugrats and I remember not enjoying it.

2123
01:42:49,370 --> 01:42:50,830
I would be like, why?

2124
01:42:52,090 --> 01:42:53,270
Am I watching this?

2125
01:42:53,370 --> 01:42:53,630
Oh, wait.

2126
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:55,270
I can't enchant the uber cheap.

2127
01:42:56,090 --> 01:42:57,130
Uber cheap.

2128
01:42:57,330 --> 01:42:57,810
Uber sheep.

2129
01:42:58,630 --> 01:42:59,390
Never mind.

2130
01:43:00,370 --> 01:43:01,610
I guess we can...

2131
01:43:01,610 --> 01:43:02,830
Oh, well.

2132
01:43:04,390 --> 01:43:04,910
Wait.

2133
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:06,510
Wait.

2134
01:43:13,170 --> 01:43:15,510
Nobody wants the Rugrats movie.

2135
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:17,770
Nobody wants the Rugrats movie.

2136
01:43:18,530 --> 01:43:20,610
Jack Black is Tommy Pickles.

2137
01:43:20,830 --> 01:43:21,350
Jack Black is Tommy Pickles.

2138
01:43:21,350 --> 01:43:22,910
I am Tommy.

2139
01:43:23,950 --> 01:43:25,010
I am Tommy.

2140
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:29,320
Big if real.

2141
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:29,940
Big if real.

2142
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:32,380
I've never seen the ANS curse.

2143
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:37,740
Fires curse energy in front.

2144
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:41,100
On hit, there is a chance to spread another curse towards another nearby target.

2145
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:47,480
A baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do.

2146
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,500
People used to say I sound like Phil and Lou.

2147
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,520
I'm so offended by that.

2148
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:01,740
EN curse but spider cooking.

2149
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:03,700
Oh, but I already use the spider cooking.

2150
01:44:07,150 --> 01:44:10,570
A baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do.

2151
01:44:12,430 --> 01:44:13,290
Don't do that.

2152
01:44:13,450 --> 01:44:13,950
Don't do that.

2153
01:44:16,730 --> 01:44:18,770
I was just trying to stay in place.

2154
01:44:19,470 --> 01:44:24,470
I don't understand the no moving challenge when it comes to things that drop on top of you.

2155
01:44:24,830 --> 01:44:29,610
Do you just have to become super tanky and really good at healing?

2156
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:35,330
Is it just all about survival and less about attack?

2157
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:43,520
Survival and knockback.

2158
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:44,240
Survival and knockback.

2159
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:45,400
Asana's good for you.

2160
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:46,440
Yeah, I can believe that.

2161
01:44:59,470 --> 01:45:00,130
Upgrade 3.

2162
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:02,250
Just thinking that.

2163
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:10,400
We're taking damage actually.

2164
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:11,580
What the hell?

2165
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:12,900
Who are you?

2166
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,460
Oh my god, I'm taking damage.

2167
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:15,920
Oh my god, I'm taking a lot of damage.

2168
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:17,540
Not

2169
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:25,580
on my watch.

2170
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:34,640
Hmm.

2171
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:51,140
I don't understand it though.

2172
01:45:51,340 --> 01:45:54,360
Gaining 15 max HP for every 6 points of total max HP.

2173
01:45:54,860 --> 01:45:55,660
Increased damage.

2174
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:58,980
3 is good on Fauna?

2175
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:00,360
I don't really understand it.

2176
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:07,920
So you get more HP, but what do you mean every 6 points of total max?

2177
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:10,760
Oh, so like if you don't take damage?

2178
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:14,780
More HP, more damage.

2179
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:16,360
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

2180
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:18,200
Hmm.

2181
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:21,900
I mean we do heal a lot because of being Fauna.

2182
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:28,160
We'll try it.

2183
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:31,240
Oh my goodness.

2184
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:32,120
Woo!

2185
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:37,100
Come here little stamp.

2186
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:39,360
Oh, oh.

2187
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:41,200
There we go.

2188
01:46:53,590 --> 01:46:55,530
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

2189
01:46:55,650 --> 01:46:56,590
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

2190
01:46:56,590 --> 01:46:57,310
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

2191
01:46:59,550 --> 01:47:01,130
What else am I going to do for Halloween?

2192
01:47:02,050 --> 01:47:03,610
I want to build a...

2193
01:47:04,390 --> 01:47:05,730
Maybe like a... Oh!

2194
01:47:05,890 --> 01:47:07,490
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

2195
01:47:07,650 --> 01:47:08,530
Quit your healing!

2196
01:47:08,690 --> 01:47:09,450
Quit your healing!

2197
01:47:09,570 --> 01:47:10,230
Quit your healing!

2198
01:47:11,810 --> 01:47:12,630
Did I kill him?

2199
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:13,390
Oh!

2200
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:14,430
Oh my goodness.

2201
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:16,330
I need health.

2202
01:47:16,570 --> 01:47:17,330
Give me health!

2203
01:47:21,090 --> 01:47:21,490
Um...

2204
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:27,250
I want to build like a haunted gingerbread house.

2205
01:47:29,930 --> 01:47:31,990
I've seen them at like the store.

2206
01:47:32,150 --> 01:47:33,270
Like kits for it, you know?

2207
01:47:35,450 --> 01:47:37,670
So I thought about maybe doing something like that.

2208
01:47:38,730 --> 01:47:39,410
I don't know.

2209
01:47:41,430 --> 01:47:41,870
Oh!

2210
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:50,870
Oh!

2211
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:54,640
Oh!

2212
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:55,080
Wait.

2213
01:47:55,220 --> 01:47:55,920
Oh, I don't have it.

2214
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:00,500
It baited me.

2215
01:48:01,140 --> 01:48:03,580
I thought I had the... I thought I finished it.

2216
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:05,880
Wow!

2217
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:06,580
Joy!

2218
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:07,640
Thanks for the 50!

2219
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:08,600
Thanks for the pink!

2220
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:12,780
Whammy water!

2221
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:15,400
Okay.

2222
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:18,160
Why not?

2223
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:20,360
Why not?

2224
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:23,720
Whammy water.

2225
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:24,760
Why not?

2226
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:26,100
Why not?

2227
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:32,150
I'll take some whammy water.

2228
01:48:33,410 --> 01:48:34,790
It is water, right guys?

2229
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:35,690
It's water.

2230
01:48:40,210 --> 01:48:41,570
Because boy am I thirsty.

2231
01:48:41,950 --> 01:48:42,950
If I chug it, I'll be fine, right?

2232
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:46,630
I'm really thirsty.

2233
01:48:46,990 --> 01:48:48,710
I'm really dehydrated right now.

2234
01:48:49,630 --> 01:48:50,890
Please, I'm so thirsty.

2235
01:48:51,550 --> 01:48:53,110
Just give me some whammy water.

2236
01:48:56,970 --> 01:48:58,530
Please, I'm so thirsty.

2237
01:48:58,690 --> 01:49:00,470
Please, I'm so thirsty.

2238
01:49:00,910 --> 01:49:01,450
Please, I'm so thirsty.

2239
01:49:01,450 --> 01:49:02,290
Gamer juice.

2240
01:49:06,050 --> 01:49:07,870
Okay, we're almost to level...

2241
01:49:08,510 --> 01:49:09,670
We're almost to...

2242
01:49:09,670 --> 01:49:11,350
Oh gosh!

2243
01:49:11,950 --> 01:49:13,030
We're almost to level 50 though.

2244
01:49:13,170 --> 01:49:14,150
So we'll get that...

2245
01:49:16,610 --> 01:49:17,870
We'll get that...

2246
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:23,120
hammer soon.

2247
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:28,480
Stop healing!

2248
01:49:30,940 --> 01:49:32,280
There's only death here.

2249
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:37,860
I like how it's like save the fans and I keep saying that I'm killing them.

2250
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:40,940
Mommy Mint needs her go-go juice.

2251
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:41,100
Mommy Mint needs her go-go juice.

2252
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:45,400
Who else is watching while in the shower?

2253
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:45,740
Who else is watching while in the shower?

2254
01:49:45,740 --> 01:49:47,200
You super chatted while in the shower.

2255
01:49:52,260 --> 01:49:52,720
Okay.

2256
01:49:54,620 --> 01:49:57,240
We're saving them by putting them out of their misery, right?

2257
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:58,060
We're saving them by putting them out of their misery, right?

2258
01:50:00,540 --> 01:50:01,460
Little fans.

2259
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:03,980
It's almost over.

2260
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:05,460
It's almost over.

2261
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:10,700
Everything...

2262
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:12,380
You'll be fine.

2263
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:13,780
You'll be safe after this.

2264
01:50:14,700 --> 01:50:16,600
You can rest now, little fans.

2265
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:28,220
You can rest

2266
01:50:48,220 --> 01:50:48,220
now, little fans.

2267
01:50:48,220 --> 01:50:48,520
Yippee!

2268
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:51,620
What should we do with our whammy water?

2269
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:53,880
What should we do with our whammy water?

2270
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:55,120
I want to start freezing people.

2271
01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:56,800
Wait, what's the one with the...

2272
01:50:57,860 --> 01:50:59,560
Wait, I can't remember.

2273
01:50:59,720 --> 01:50:59,920
Hold on.

2274
01:51:03,980 --> 01:51:04,700
The penlight.

2275
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:07,640
The penlight.

2276
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:07,920
Drink it.

2277
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:10,300
Or wait, should I do the BL book with it?

2278
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:12,000
Wait, which one...

2279
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:14,100
Does the BL book also freeze?

2280
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:16,060
Oh, it does have that effect too?

2281
01:51:16,220 --> 01:51:17,460
Okay, then we'll go with the BL book.

2282
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:23,820
I could choose either one!

2283
01:51:24,100 --> 01:51:25,400
The world is my oyster!

2284
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:28,800
Okay.

2285
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:29,820
Okay.

2286
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,280
Ask and you shall receive.

2287
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:35,440
Accepting the gotcha.

2288
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:38,360
Then we hate you.

2289
01:51:39,180 --> 01:51:39,660
Yeah!

2290
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:49,420
There it is, baby!

2291
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:51,820
There it is, baby!

2292
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:56,980
Oh, chocolate aberration!

2293
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:01,980
Oh, and I need it.

2294
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,480
Because I'm dying currently.

2295
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:03,720
I'm currently...

2296
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,460
I'm currently really dying.

2297
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:15,880
I'm currently not having a good time.

2298
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:19,260
I'm currently not dodging anything, actually.

2299
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:20,540
I'm currently...

2300
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:22,840
Having a tough time at the moment.

2301
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:24,300
I'm currently...

2302
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:24,760
Um...

2303
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:25,740
Oh, gosh.

2304
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:26,720
Oh!

2305
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:29,860
I'm currently...

2306
01:52:30,260 --> 01:52:31,240
Not doing so hot.

2307
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:35,380
I'm currently unable to see anything that's going on on the screen.

2308
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:43,230
I'm currently unable to see anything that's going on on the screen.

2309
01:52:43,230 --> 01:52:44,430
Stop shooting at me, please.

2310
01:52:47,030 --> 01:52:48,810
I'm currently going through it, yeah.

2311
01:52:50,970 --> 01:52:51,930
I'm currently...

2312
01:52:53,770 --> 01:52:55,390
The number isn't going down.

2313
01:52:57,730 --> 01:52:58,930
Because we're just that good.

2314
01:53:00,910 --> 01:53:02,170
We're just that good, baby.

2315
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:08,130
It's fine.

2316
01:53:08,690 --> 01:53:09,170
Oh.

2317
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:15,600
Back into the green circle.

2318
01:53:16,940 --> 01:53:18,620
Green woman in the green circle.

2319
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:24,800
Why is green so unpopular with VTubers, I wonder?

2320
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:28,100
I know blue is nice, but like...

2321
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:32,000
You could be like me and be a mix of both.

2322
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:32,740
Oh, hello.

2323
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:34,280
I didn't even notice.

2324
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:44,380
Blue is so popular with VTubers, I feel.

2325
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:45,380
Blue and like purple.

2326
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:47,080
And things like that, you know?

2327
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:50,140
We love green woman.

2328
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:50,660
Yippee!

2329
01:53:54,970 --> 01:53:55,970
Oh, no.

2330
01:53:58,130 --> 01:53:59,470
No, sorry.

2331
01:53:59,850 --> 01:54:00,870
I don't want that.

2332
01:54:02,530 --> 01:54:03,030
No.

2333
01:54:03,910 --> 01:54:05,090
I think I'm good.

2334
01:54:06,510 --> 01:54:08,530
In fact, I'm just gonna like sit here.

2335
01:54:10,110 --> 01:54:10,610
Oh.

2336
01:54:15,850 --> 01:54:17,170
I'm gonna sell that.

2337
01:54:19,950 --> 01:54:20,990
Don't ask me why.

2338
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:22,010
I use my ult.

2339
01:54:22,810 --> 01:54:23,630
It's because...

2340
01:54:24,610 --> 01:54:26,870
I felt it in my bones.

2341
01:54:26,990 --> 01:54:27,730
Or something.

2342
01:54:27,810 --> 01:54:28,070
I don't know.

2343
01:54:29,970 --> 01:54:30,310
Huh.

2344
01:54:31,130 --> 01:54:32,610
Whammy Water Max.

2345
01:54:33,870 --> 01:54:35,310
Whammy Water Max.

2346
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:37,650
Whammy Water Max.

2347
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:38,030
Oh.

2348
01:54:38,390 --> 01:54:39,070
Oh.

2349
01:54:39,410 --> 01:54:39,910
Oh.

2350
01:54:40,510 --> 01:54:40,850
Ha.

2351
01:54:41,030 --> 01:54:41,650
Okay.

2352
01:54:43,770 --> 01:54:44,110
Meow.

2353
01:54:45,330 --> 01:54:45,670
Oh.

2354
01:54:47,570 --> 01:54:48,650
My ghost about...

2355
01:54:48,650 --> 01:54:48,870
Oh, yeah.

2356
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:49,350
What bones?

2357
01:54:49,570 --> 01:54:50,050
Hahaha.

2358
01:54:50,570 --> 01:54:51,570
My phantom bones.

2359
01:54:51,930 --> 01:54:52,850
It's kind of like, you know?

2360
01:54:52,930 --> 01:54:54,050
It's a phantom pain.

2361
01:54:54,290 --> 01:54:55,270
I have phantom bones.

2362
01:54:55,670 --> 01:54:57,490
I feel like I could still feel my bones.

2363
01:55:07,950 --> 01:55:09,470
It's just silly ghost things.

2364
01:55:12,170 --> 01:55:13,670
Gosh, what if I still have bones?

2365
01:55:15,110 --> 01:55:17,750
Because I know what having bones used to feel like.

2366
01:55:17,830 --> 01:55:18,190
I think.

2367
01:55:19,750 --> 01:55:22,610
I might be a pile of goo now, but...

2368
01:55:25,510 --> 01:55:26,170
I don't know.

2369
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:27,350
I'm still stiff.

2370
01:55:28,230 --> 01:55:28,410
Hahaha.

2371
01:55:31,110 --> 01:55:31,510
Probably.

2372
01:55:33,390 --> 01:55:34,550
Having bones sucks.

2373
01:55:34,830 --> 01:55:35,030
What?

2374
01:55:35,870 --> 01:55:36,270
Okay.

2375
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:37,110
Come on.

2376
01:55:37,210 --> 01:55:38,250
You're going to say that to me?

2377
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:39,870
I wish I had bones right now.

2378
01:55:40,470 --> 01:55:41,070
I think.

2379
01:55:45,070 --> 01:55:45,470
Wow.

2380
01:55:45,610 --> 01:55:47,430
Don't take your bones for granted, you guys.

2381
01:55:57,390 --> 01:55:59,710
Do you like your VTubers boneless or with bones?

2382
01:56:01,450 --> 01:56:02,850
How do you prefer your VTubers?

2383
01:56:04,710 --> 01:56:06,150
Boneless VTubers with bones?

2384
01:56:08,050 --> 01:56:08,990
How do you prefer?

2385
01:56:10,910 --> 01:56:11,890
Oh my gosh.

2386
01:56:12,610 --> 01:56:14,290
Joy, thank you for the VTuber gift.

2387
01:56:14,290 --> 01:56:14,770
Thank you.

2388
01:56:16,890 --> 01:56:17,730
In the shower.

2389
01:56:19,090 --> 01:56:20,850
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

2390
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:36,980
The screams are so scary.

2391
01:56:37,220 --> 01:56:37,620
Oh.

2392
01:56:38,140 --> 01:56:38,860
Oh my goodness.

2393
01:56:41,740 --> 01:56:43,200
Oh, I'm trapped on a wall.

2394
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:44,460
Oh, I'm trapped again.

2395
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:45,920
I'm trying to get out of here.

2396
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:46,660
I'm trying to leave.

2397
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:47,800
Please excuse me.

2398
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:48,640
Please leave.

2399
01:56:48,740 --> 01:56:49,000
Let me.

2400
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:49,760
Please let me leave.

2401
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:50,560
Please let me leave!

2402
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:55,420
Goodness gracious.

2403
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:08,940
Yippee!

2404
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:14,140
I like to just get away from the Touhou stuff.

2405
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:17,340
My days of Touhou are over.

2406
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:19,200
I did my crimes.

2407
01:57:19,580 --> 01:57:21,280
I did my times, okay?

2408
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,300
I don't have to Danmaku any longer.

2409
01:57:25,700 --> 01:57:26,400
Oh my goodness.

2410
01:57:27,100 --> 01:57:27,880
Oh my god.

2411
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:28,420
Oh.

2412
01:57:28,820 --> 01:57:29,160
Oh.

2413
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:29,460
Oh.

2414
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:31,220
Why do I become so slow?

2415
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:36,200
Why am I so heavy?

2416
01:57:47,970 --> 01:57:49,190
Crimes, crimes, crimes.

2417
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:54,270
I've run out of saplings.

2418
01:57:55,070 --> 01:57:57,270
Please, little saplings, come back to me!

2419
01:57:57,610 --> 01:57:57,930
Oh.

2420
01:57:58,830 --> 01:58:00,930
What should we go with, you guys?

2421
01:58:01,710 --> 01:58:02,830
I have like...

2422
01:58:03,450 --> 01:58:04,010
Nothing.

2423
01:58:04,810 --> 01:58:06,830
I have so much room.

2424
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:07,830
And curse?

2425
01:58:08,670 --> 01:58:09,690
Oh yeah, I haven't tried it.

2426
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:10,910
Let's go for it.

2427
01:58:16,980 --> 01:58:17,780
Where is it?

2428
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:18,900
What's it doing?

2429
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:20,180
What's the curse?

2430
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:21,000
What is it happening?

2431
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:22,320
Where's the curse?

2432
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:23,840
What's going on?

2433
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:24,600
Oh, we did it.

2434
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:25,140
Yippee!

2435
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:31,740
Ellie, welcome to membership.

2436
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:32,220
Thank you!

2437
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:36,800
Look for purple.

2438
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:37,280
Oh, okay.

2439
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:39,760
Awesome.

2440
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:46,080
Okay.

2441
01:58:46,580 --> 01:58:46,980
Okay.

2442
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:50,180
Everybody, give me more saplings.

2443
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:51,800
Die for me.

2444
01:58:52,020 --> 01:58:53,180
Die for sapling.

2445
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:54,280
Die...

2446
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:54,480
Oh.

2447
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:56,020
Die to become sapling.

2448
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,060
I can barely see it.

2449
01:58:58,120 --> 01:58:58,780
I can't see it.

2450
01:58:58,820 --> 01:58:59,700
I can't see it at all.

2451
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:04,120
Maybe I do see it.

2452
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:04,840
I'm not sure actually.

2453
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:08,000
Maybe I do see it.

2454
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:09,380
I can't tell.

2455
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:09,900
Oh my goodness.

2456
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:12,920
Not ready to ult yet.

2457
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:13,460
Not yet.

2458
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:13,980
Not yet.

2459
01:59:14,020 --> 01:59:14,380
Not yet.

2460
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:18,240
Not yet.

2461
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:18,620
Not yet.

2462
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:19,300
Not yet.

2463
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:19,380
Not yet.

2464
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:19,700
Not yet.

2465
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:20,060
What is it?

2466
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:22,320
Ian's curse plus board is what people say.

2467
01:59:26,630 --> 01:59:27,510
Oh, I see the purple.

2468
01:59:29,010 --> 01:59:30,110
I'm not ready to ult yet.

2469
01:59:30,170 --> 01:59:31,130
I'm not ready to ult yet.

2470
01:59:31,190 --> 01:59:32,130
I'm not ready to ult yet.

2471
01:59:32,770 --> 01:59:33,310
Not yet.

2472
01:59:33,370 --> 01:59:33,710
Not yet.

2473
01:59:34,530 --> 01:59:35,030
I'm okay.

2474
01:59:35,110 --> 01:59:35,350
I'm okay.

2475
01:59:35,390 --> 01:59:35,690
I'm okay.

2476
01:59:36,490 --> 01:59:36,990
I'm okay.

2477
01:59:38,230 --> 01:59:38,730
I'm okay.

2478
01:59:38,850 --> 01:59:39,010
I'm okay.

2479
01:59:39,090 --> 01:59:39,330
I'm okay.

2480
01:59:39,410 --> 01:59:39,730
I'm okay.

2481
01:59:42,660 --> 01:59:42,980
I'm okay.

2482
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:44,800
I'm okay.

2483
01:59:45,140 --> 01:59:45,560
I'm okay.

2484
01:59:46,060 --> 01:59:46,480
I'm okay.

2485
01:59:46,620 --> 01:59:46,760
I'm okay.

2486
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:47,040
I'm okay.

2487
01:59:47,100 --> 01:59:47,220
I'm okay.

2488
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:51,540
I'm okay, I'm okay.

2489
01:59:56,220 --> 01:59:56,980
Yes, the board.

2490
01:59:57,140 --> 01:59:57,920
Or tears.

2491
01:59:58,360 --> 01:59:58,680
Okay.

2492
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:01,160
Good to know.

2493
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:01,620
Thank you.

2494
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:03,660
Oh my goodness.

2495
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:10,360
Oh my gosh, I keep eating these Danmaku, for real.

2496
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:12,260
Am I okay?

2497
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:15,320
When I said my Touhou days are done...

2498
02:00:20,070 --> 02:00:21,630
Curseball is not... Not tears.

2499
02:00:21,890 --> 02:00:22,490
Oh, okay.

2500
02:00:22,550 --> 02:00:23,310
Don't do tears.

2501
02:00:23,610 --> 02:00:25,930
But I want to complete my list!

2502
02:00:29,270 --> 02:00:30,790
I will not do...

2503
02:00:33,950 --> 02:00:35,130
I will resist.

2504
02:00:36,770 --> 02:00:37,330
Okay.

2505
02:00:40,270 --> 02:00:43,690
Now I can collect everything without worry.

2506
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:45,310
Yes.

2507
02:00:46,670 --> 02:00:48,090
You can't touch me.

2508
02:00:48,210 --> 02:00:49,390
Okay, now you can touch me.

2509
02:00:49,490 --> 02:00:50,330
I'm scared about that.

2510
02:00:50,970 --> 02:00:51,410
Frozen!

2511
02:00:54,490 --> 02:00:57,110
Who told me that the books freeze?

2512
02:00:57,270 --> 02:00:58,330
They haven't frozen anything.

2513
02:01:05,630 --> 02:01:06,490
Reroll for board.

2514
02:01:06,610 --> 02:01:07,430
Oh, I should have, right?

2515
02:01:07,790 --> 02:01:08,630
Oh, they slow.

2516
02:01:09,390 --> 02:01:10,650
I see, I see.

2517
02:01:12,650 --> 02:01:13,270
Swap one?

2518
02:01:14,650 --> 02:01:16,230
No, I think I'm going to keep it.

2519
02:01:16,510 --> 02:01:17,930
I do like having this one.

2520
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,420
Freeze is just the sake.

2521
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:26,060
Ah, you made a mistake!

2522
02:01:29,180 --> 02:01:30,400
Okay, well, it's alright.

2523
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:31,640
I'll just sell it.

2524
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:41,480
Reroll!

2525
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:42,080
Ah!

2526
02:01:44,260 --> 02:01:44,700
Perfect.

2527
02:01:46,060 --> 02:01:47,320
Guys, we got it.

2528
02:01:48,380 --> 02:01:49,440
We got it, baby.

2529
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:51,180
We got it, baby.

2530
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:52,860
We got it, baby.

2531
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:54,800
We got it, baby.

2532
02:01:55,740 --> 02:01:57,060
We're so good, baby.

2533
02:01:57,740 --> 02:01:58,560
We're good, baby.

2534
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:00,320
We're good, baby.

2535
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:02,400
Oh, we're good, babe.

2536
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:02,900
We're good.

2537
02:02:02,980 --> 02:02:03,880
We're alright, baby.

2538
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:05,020
Maybe not good.

2539
02:02:05,180 --> 02:02:07,360
Maybe good is a big word, baby.

2540
02:02:09,700 --> 02:02:10,580
Babycore, thanks for the gift.

2541
02:02:11,820 --> 02:02:13,120
You got this, boss, baby.

2542
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:16,260
I can't even remember what...

2543
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:16,600
Burr...

2544
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:17,420
Burr...

2545
02:02:17,420 --> 02:02:19,040
Board plus curse...

2546
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:19,680
The burst.

2547
02:02:20,940 --> 02:02:22,000
Board plus curses.

2548
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:24,000
Well, you will see.

2549
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:25,020
Maybe.

2550
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:25,500
Hopefully.

2551
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:27,060
As long as I live!

2552
02:02:29,700 --> 02:02:32,420
You can't kill me if I'm already dead.

2553
02:02:33,660 --> 02:02:36,300
You can't kill me if I'm already dead.

2554
02:02:45,580 --> 02:02:46,080
Miss.

2555
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:46,560
Miss.

2556
02:02:48,440 --> 02:02:49,480
Did I max?

2557
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:49,900
Okay.

2558
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:51,250
We maxed out curse, so...

2559
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:55,340
Do-do-do-do.

2560
02:02:55,600 --> 02:02:56,100
Oh,

2561
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:03,800
they're getting really close up on me.

2562
02:03:03,860 --> 02:03:05,140
It's scaring me a little bit.

2563
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:07,900
They're getting really close on me, guys.

2564
02:03:08,100 --> 02:03:09,220
Oh, I just dropped.

2565
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:09,520
Oh!

2566
02:03:11,560 --> 02:03:11,960
Oh!

2567
02:03:12,060 --> 02:03:12,320
Nice.

2568
02:03:24,740 --> 02:03:25,460
Getting bored.

2569
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:27,460
Almost there.

2570
02:03:27,580 --> 02:03:27,880
Almost there.

2571
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:28,340
Almost there.

2572
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:28,760
Almost there.

2573
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:31,100
Oh my gosh.

2574
02:03:31,700 --> 02:03:33,020
Oh my gosh, I keep eating.

2575
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:34,400
Ganmaku.

2576
02:03:34,860 --> 02:03:35,260
Always.

2577
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:40,560
But they're like... they're forbidden!

2578
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:42,080
Haichu or something.

2579
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:42,540
I don't know.

2580
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:43,180
They look so delicious.

2581
02:03:49,340 --> 02:03:50,060
So curious.

2582
02:03:50,260 --> 02:03:51,560
I don't even see the board.

2583
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:52,940
Is it even doing anything?

2584
02:03:53,100 --> 02:03:53,680
I don't even know.

2585
02:03:56,360 --> 02:03:56,940
Oh yeah!

2586
02:03:57,020 --> 02:03:57,880
Let's grab the horns!

2587
02:03:57,960 --> 02:03:58,780
What's wrong with me?

2588
02:03:58,880 --> 02:03:59,340
Oh my gosh.

2589
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:01,600
Let's grab the horns while we have them.

2590
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:04,320
I should have grabbed them from long ago.

2591
02:04:04,660 --> 02:04:05,160
Oh my god.

2592
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:10,820
Horns go... I've been meaning to get them for so long.

2593
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:12,680
There we go.

2594
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:13,540
There we go!

2595
02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:14,640
Now, now, now, now.

2596
02:04:14,640 --> 02:04:17,580
Now Fauna should be much in a better situation.

2597
02:04:21,750 --> 02:04:23,010
True Fauna strats.

2598
02:04:24,930 --> 02:04:28,470
I was so... my mind was so one track on like... you know.

2599
02:04:29,310 --> 02:04:30,110
Bandage as well?

2600
02:04:30,270 --> 02:04:30,630
Okay.

2601
02:04:30,750 --> 02:04:32,430
Well, if we see the bandage, we'll get that.

2602
02:04:32,490 --> 02:04:34,010
We have lots of space, so...

2603
02:04:58,580 --> 02:05:01,360
There's not enough like... pushback, whatever it's called.

2604
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:06,920
Okay.

2605
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:07,820
Alright.

2606
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:08,780
Okay.

2607
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:14,300
Where is...

2608
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:17,640
Get out of my way!

2609
02:05:23,570 --> 02:05:26,810
Don't bite the hand that feeds you if it's holding a knife.

2610
02:05:27,130 --> 02:05:28,110
Let's see what happens.

2611
02:05:29,990 --> 02:05:30,550
Holy...

2612
02:05:33,510 --> 02:05:34,610
Holy cow!

2613
02:05:34,870 --> 02:05:35,830
Holy cow, holy cow.

2614
02:05:37,630 --> 02:05:38,470
Holy cow.

2615
02:05:41,290 --> 02:05:43,050
I'm gonna reroll for...

2616
02:05:44,210 --> 02:05:44,750
Bandage.

2617
02:06:07,460 --> 02:06:09,720
I'm just hiding between, I think Axe...

2618
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:13,040
Tears?

2619
02:06:13,060 --> 02:06:13,700
But they're not...

2620
02:06:13,700 --> 02:06:15,840
These ones are... are... enchanted.

2621
02:06:20,720 --> 02:06:24,060
These ones aren't... aren't... enchanted.

2622
02:06:28,870 --> 02:06:29,590
Ubersheep?

2623
02:06:30,410 --> 02:06:32,110
I already have Ubersheep.

2624
02:06:32,730 --> 02:06:35,690
It's a... I already... I already have Ubersheep.

2625
02:06:35,690 --> 02:06:36,030
Hahaha.

2626
02:06:38,310 --> 02:06:39,890
Joy, thanks for the 50 gift!

2627
02:06:40,030 --> 02:06:40,750
Thank you!

2628
02:06:42,110 --> 02:06:42,510
Potato?

2629
02:06:48,710 --> 02:06:49,110
Okay.

2630
02:06:49,490 --> 02:06:50,750
It's best if not... Okay.

2631
02:06:50,990 --> 02:06:52,490
We'll try... I'll try... I'll do the potato.

2632
02:06:52,730 --> 02:06:53,250
Oh my goodness.

2633
02:06:53,430 --> 02:06:53,810
Oh my goodness.

2634
02:06:53,910 --> 02:06:54,230
Oh my goodness.

2635
02:06:54,270 --> 02:06:54,630
Oh my goodness.

2636
02:06:54,650 --> 02:06:54,930
Oh my goodness.

2637
02:06:55,050 --> 02:06:55,350
Oh my goodness.

2638
02:06:56,890 --> 02:06:57,290
Wow!

2639
02:06:57,550 --> 02:06:57,950
Come on!

2640
02:06:59,450 --> 02:07:00,130
Give me money.

2641
02:07:06,170 --> 02:07:08,930
Despite not being a coin run, it's alright.

2642
02:07:09,130 --> 02:07:09,810
We're not a coin.

2643
02:07:10,050 --> 02:07:10,970
I'll take it, you know?

2644
02:07:12,170 --> 02:07:12,630
Sheesh.

2645
02:07:13,450 --> 02:07:14,310
Oh my goodness.

2646
02:07:14,630 --> 02:07:16,310
I think it's so close up on me.

2647
02:07:16,510 --> 02:07:16,830
It's...

2648
02:07:16,830 --> 02:07:17,390
Ah!

2649
02:07:18,550 --> 02:07:18,910
Oh!

2650
02:07:19,830 --> 02:07:20,970
I got the bandage.

2651
02:07:22,450 --> 02:07:23,870
Increase max HP by 10.

2652
02:07:25,050 --> 02:07:26,450
After being hit, heal 10%.

2653
02:07:26,450 --> 02:07:26,870
Everything's...

2654
02:07:26,870 --> 02:07:27,750
Oh, okay.

2655
02:07:32,160 --> 02:07:34,220
I mean, I'm getting hit a lot, so...

2656
02:07:35,720 --> 02:07:37,440
Probably should take it, huh?

2657
02:07:39,260 --> 02:07:41,380
I'm getting hit, like, a lot.

2658
02:07:41,680 --> 02:07:42,760
So, I think...

2659
02:07:49,680 --> 02:07:52,500
I still have space, so if there's anything else that I want to get...

2660
02:08:02,570 --> 02:08:03,010
No!

2661
02:08:04,770 --> 02:08:07,390
I just can't seem to...

2662
02:08:07,390 --> 02:08:11,150
I can't... Oh, they're just, like, literally on top of me.

2663
02:08:11,690 --> 02:08:13,110
These fans are crazy!

2664
02:08:14,330 --> 02:08:15,370
Oh my god.

2665
02:08:16,570 --> 02:08:17,010
Guys.

2666
02:08:18,210 --> 02:08:18,910
Time to ult.

2667
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:32,380
They're just on top of me!

2668
02:08:33,940 --> 02:08:34,260
No!

2669
02:08:35,460 --> 02:08:37,200
Guys, I don't know if I'm going to make it to 30 minutes.

2670
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:38,780
Oh, I don't think I'm going to make it to 30 minutes.

2671
02:08:38,900 --> 02:08:39,980
I don't think I'm going to make it to 30 minutes.

2672
02:08:51,510 --> 02:08:51,830
Feather!

2673
02:08:56,700 --> 02:09:01,120
We could feather.

2674
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:02,380
We get a revive.

2675
02:09:02,660 --> 02:09:03,260
That's so true.

2676
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:05,180
I once got the...

2677
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:07,680
I once got, like, the super feather.

2678
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:07,900
I once got, like, the super feather.

2679
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:10,260
I once got, like, the super feather.

2680
02:09:10,260 --> 02:09:10,820
Out of a pull.

2681
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:13,340
It was so good.

2682
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:15,540
I wish I could get a meal.

2683
02:09:16,740 --> 02:09:18,800
I could reroll for the meal.

2684
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:24,560
What if I don't get it, though?

2685
02:09:26,740 --> 02:09:28,100
Super feather is so good.

2686
02:09:36,100 --> 02:09:37,680
What do you mean meal wouldn't help?

2687
02:09:37,780 --> 02:09:39,180
You guys, it's double healing!

2688
02:09:39,660 --> 02:09:40,460
Look at me!

2689
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:43,060
I'm taking damage like crazy!

2690
02:09:49,600 --> 02:09:49,880
Hmm...

2691
02:09:50,860 --> 02:09:51,860
Feather should take you to 30.

2692
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:53,440
Alright, let's try it.

2693
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:54,280
Oh, my God.

2694
02:09:54,420 --> 02:09:55,240
Oh, my God.

2695
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:56,660
Oh, my God.

2696
02:09:57,100 --> 02:09:58,320
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

2697
02:09:58,660 --> 02:09:59,360
No, no, no!

2698
02:09:59,360 --> 02:10:00,180
I don't know about that, guys!

2699
02:10:00,300 --> 02:10:00,740
I don't know!

2700
02:10:00,740 --> 02:10:01,520
I don't know about that!

2701
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:01,920
I don't know!

2702
02:10:06,300 --> 02:10:06,780
Oh, my gosh.

2703
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:07,260
I'm full health.

2704
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:08,140
How'd that happen?

2705
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:24,200
More feather!

2706
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:26,000
I want the two revives!

2707
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:28,780
Oh, gosh!

2708
02:10:30,660 --> 02:10:31,280
I don't care.

2709
02:10:31,540 --> 02:10:31,820
Maybe...

2710
02:10:31,820 --> 02:10:32,200
I don't know, though.

2711
02:10:32,220 --> 02:10:32,260
I don't know.

2712
02:10:32,260 --> 02:10:33,060
Oh, my gosh.

2713
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:33,920
I don't know what to do.

2714
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:39,000
Four for HP?

2715
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:39,380
True.

2716
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:42,160
Oh, my God.

2717
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,860
I like how it's just like, by the way, you're taking damage.

2718
02:10:46,540 --> 02:10:47,520
You're taking damage, by the way.

2719
02:10:47,580 --> 02:10:48,060
Oh, my gosh!

2720
02:10:48,180 --> 02:10:48,680
Oh, my gosh!

2721
02:10:49,220 --> 02:10:49,740
Oh, my gosh!

2722
02:11:03,820 --> 02:11:04,380
This sucks.

2723
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:05,760
This sucks!

2724
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:07,520
This sucks!

2725
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:11,660
Will I get the two revives now?

2726
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:12,840
Oh, my God.

2727
02:11:12,860 --> 02:11:14,060
They just come up on me.

2728
02:11:14,060 --> 02:11:14,560
They're so fast!

2729
02:11:15,220 --> 02:11:16,100
Get away from me!

2730
02:11:16,340 --> 02:11:16,780
Please!

2731
02:11:17,340 --> 02:11:17,940
Stay away!

2732
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:26,600
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna make it to 30 minutes.

2733
02:11:27,740 --> 02:11:28,740
Oh, man!

2734
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:32,080
We got so close, though.

2735
02:11:33,500 --> 02:11:34,620
We got so close.

2736
02:11:34,660 --> 02:11:35,260
I'm just gonna leave.

2737
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:35,780
Bye!

2738
02:11:38,220 --> 02:11:38,660
Bye!

2739
02:11:40,200 --> 02:11:40,820
Just run.

2740
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:41,760
Just run, Fauna.

2741
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:42,320
Run.

2742
02:11:42,600 --> 02:11:43,160
Run away.

2743
02:11:44,540 --> 02:11:45,340
Run, Fauna!

2744
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:45,600
Run!

2745
02:11:45,940 --> 02:11:46,560
Fauna, run!

2746
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:47,420
Run, Fauna!

2747
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:48,000
Fauna, run!

2748
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:48,100
Run, Fauna!

2749
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:48,820
Run, Fauna!

2750
02:11:50,060 --> 02:11:50,720
Run, Fauna!

2751
02:11:51,120 --> 02:11:51,640
Fauna, run!

2752
02:11:52,180 --> 02:11:52,680
Fauna, run!

2753
02:11:53,320 --> 02:11:55,560
Just heal when you can, Fauna!

2754
02:11:55,680 --> 02:11:56,040
Run!

2755
02:11:56,580 --> 02:11:57,300
Run, Fauna!

2756
02:11:57,360 --> 02:11:57,560
Run!

2757
02:12:04,990 --> 02:12:05,570
Fauna, run!

2758
02:12:05,830 --> 02:12:06,490
Fauna, run!

2759
02:12:06,630 --> 02:12:07,650
Just get out of there!

2760
02:12:08,810 --> 02:12:09,530
Run, Fauna!

2761
02:12:17,020 --> 02:12:17,520
Don't meow!

2762
02:12:17,680 --> 02:12:18,040
Don't meow!

2763
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:18,420
Don't meow!

2764
02:12:18,460 --> 02:12:18,740
Don't meow!

2765
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:22,540
Oh, my ult's better!

2766
02:12:26,180 --> 02:12:26,540
Oh!

2767
02:12:32,870 --> 02:12:33,230
Okay.

2768
02:12:34,010 --> 02:12:36,430
My health went down so fast, I didn't even have a chance to ult.

2769
02:12:36,530 --> 02:12:36,890
Oh, my health's better!

2770
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:43,540
15 seconds left, baby!

2771
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:44,780
Baby!

2772
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:45,040
Baby!

2773
02:12:45,120 --> 02:12:45,300
Baby!

2774
02:12:45,340 --> 02:12:45,440
Baby!

2775
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:45,600
Baby!

2776
02:12:51,400 --> 02:12:52,100
Oh, my god!

2777
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:52,640
Hello, greed!

2778
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:54,320
At

2779
02:13:02,410 --> 02:13:04,530
the very end is hilarious.

2780
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:06,110
I know.

2781
02:13:06,210 --> 02:13:07,010
A bit late, huh?

2782
02:13:09,050 --> 02:13:09,530
It's okay.

2783
02:13:12,250 --> 02:13:13,030
Okay, run, Fauna.

2784
02:13:13,070 --> 02:13:13,270
Run.

2785
02:13:13,610 --> 02:13:14,170
Fauna, run.

2786
02:13:14,690 --> 02:13:15,330
Run, Fauna.

2787
02:13:15,370 --> 02:13:15,550
Run.

2788
02:13:16,130 --> 02:13:17,010
Go this way, Fauna.

2789
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:21,680
Oh, shit.

2790
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:22,860
Oh, shit.

2791
02:13:23,860 --> 02:13:24,220
Oh!

2792
02:13:24,300 --> 02:13:24,660
Oh!

2793
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:25,040
Oh!

2794
02:13:29,670 --> 02:13:29,890
Oh!

2795
02:13:29,890 --> 02:13:30,050
Oh!

2796
02:13:30,070 --> 02:13:31,090
You guys!

2797
02:13:31,170 --> 02:13:31,750
We did it!

2798
02:13:38,980 --> 02:13:40,200
We did it!

2799
02:13:40,780 --> 02:13:40,980
We

2800
02:13:48,110 --> 02:13:48,610
made it!

2801
02:13:50,410 --> 02:13:52,250
We had to cheese that... well, not cheese.

2802
02:13:52,390 --> 02:13:57,270
We had to like really... we kind of like had to cheat that a little bit, but...

2803
02:13:58,150 --> 02:14:02,650
We made it!

2804
02:14:02,930 --> 02:14:04,070
My high score.

2805
02:14:08,050 --> 02:14:09,850
I'm number 500 plus.

2806
02:14:10,210 --> 02:14:10,690
No!

2807
02:14:22,010 --> 02:14:22,410
Yay!

2808
02:14:23,090 --> 02:14:23,490
Yay!

2809
02:14:23,670 --> 02:14:23,870
Yay!

2810
02:14:25,670 --> 02:14:26,070
Yay!

2811
02:14:26,070 --> 02:14:26,290
Yay!

2812
02:14:26,290 --> 02:14:26,590
Yay!

2813
02:14:26,790 --> 02:14:26,810
Yay!

2814
02:14:26,810 --> 02:14:27,050
Yay!

2815
02:14:27,250 --> 02:14:27,270
Yay!

2816
02:14:28,310 --> 02:14:28,710
Yay!

2817
02:14:28,710 --> 02:14:29,030
Yay!

2818
02:14:29,370 --> 02:14:29,450
Yay!

2819
02:14:29,450 --> 02:14:29,530
Yay!

2820
02:14:31,390 --> 02:14:31,410
Yay!

2821
02:14:31,430 --> 02:14:31,450
Yay!

2822
02:14:31,470 --> 02:14:31,490
Yay!

2823
02:14:31,510 --> 02:14:31,530
Yay!

2824
02:14:31,550 --> 02:14:31,750
Yay!

2825
02:14:35,690 --> 02:14:37,550
Kiwawa saved the day.

2826
02:14:37,770 --> 02:14:40,230
Thank you my beloved chicken waifu.

2827
02:14:40,830 --> 02:14:41,850
I love you.

2828
02:14:44,550 --> 02:14:45,370
Check daily?

2829
02:14:45,730 --> 02:14:46,330
Oh, let's see.

2830
02:14:50,550 --> 02:14:51,130
Mom.

2831
02:15:08,170 --> 02:15:09,330
Mom, look at me.

2832
02:15:09,610 --> 02:15:11,130
I'm on the leaderboard.

2833
02:15:11,290 --> 02:15:12,570
Sorry, investigator.

2834
02:15:13,570 --> 02:15:14,570
That's me!

2835
02:15:15,970 --> 02:15:17,470
Number one!

2836
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:25,100
I would like to thank my

2837
02:15:28,580 --> 02:15:30,180
Kiwawa.

2838
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,440
And Uber.

2839
02:15:37,760 --> 02:15:39,940
For delivering me hamburgers.

2840
02:15:45,220 --> 02:15:46,520
Okay, I'm over it.

2841
02:15:46,700 --> 02:15:47,420
Yay!

2842
02:15:47,680 --> 02:15:48,160
Thank you!

2843
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:51,880
Thank you guys for playing Hollow Cure again with me.

2844
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:53,560
As you can tell, I'm a little bit obsessed.

2845
02:15:53,900 --> 02:15:57,300
Because I've just been playing it quite a bit.

2846
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:02,720
So, I can buy more upgrades.

2847
02:16:02,940 --> 02:16:03,660
Thanks for the coin!

2848
02:16:06,940 --> 02:16:08,740
It's so much fun.

2849
02:16:09,220 --> 02:16:10,280
It's so much fun.

2850
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:10,820
Oh my gosh.

2851
02:16:14,300 --> 02:16:15,260
But, yeah.

2852
02:16:16,240 --> 02:16:17,400
I said before.

2853
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:19,640
I was like, I won't play again until the new update.

2854
02:16:23,620 --> 02:16:26,560
I don't want to say that will be the case.

2855
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:28,300
But...

2856
02:16:31,020 --> 02:16:33,740
I do want to do some more grinding before I play again.

2857
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:37,440
It really just depends on how busy I am.

2858
02:16:39,420 --> 02:16:41,780
I couldn't obviously play while I was in Japan.

2859
02:16:41,940 --> 02:16:43,660
I didn't even have my computer, so...

2860
02:16:48,380 --> 02:16:50,820
Just 500 coins short of an HP upgrade?

2861
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:53,340
Oh, you're right!

2862
02:16:56,200 --> 02:16:56,680
Yeah.

2863
02:16:56,900 --> 02:16:57,300
Oh well.

2864
02:16:59,820 --> 02:17:01,100
There's still Hollow House 2.

2865
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:02,900
Let's fish, like, just a little bit.

2866
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:05,940
Let's go as the goat Kiwala.

2867
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:11,260
Mick...

2868
02:17:13,440 --> 02:17:13,920
Mickey!

2869
02:17:14,940 --> 02:17:16,140
Thanks for the five gifted.

2870
02:17:16,940 --> 02:17:17,760
Thank you!

2871
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:32,960
Shrimp.

2872
02:17:44,860 --> 02:17:45,500
Shrimp 2.

2873
02:17:48,980 --> 02:17:51,020
What if I just did a whole stream of Justice?

2874
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:52,460
Would you guys be okay with that?

2875
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:09,720
Yeah.

2876
02:18:15,140 --> 02:18:16,220
This puss-yapping?

2877
02:18:16,480 --> 02:18:16,920
Okay.

2878
02:18:21,560 --> 02:18:22,220
We'll play.

2879
02:18:24,180 --> 02:18:25,940
It makes me want to fall asleep, though.

2880
02:18:26,100 --> 02:18:26,800
In a good way.

2881
02:18:28,620 --> 02:18:30,820
There's an achievement for getting a ton in a row.

2882
02:18:38,040 --> 02:18:39,240
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no!

2883
02:18:44,580 --> 02:18:45,500
Oh, my goodness!

2884
02:18:46,340 --> 02:18:46,780
Tuna!

2885
02:18:49,720 --> 02:18:50,840
Always fun to watch...

2886
02:18:50,840 --> 02:18:51,820
...you gaming...

2887
02:18:51,820 --> 02:18:53,740
...looking forward to your performance at Off-Season Live tonight.

2888
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:54,440
I'll see you there!

2889
02:18:54,500 --> 02:18:54,960
See you there!

2890
02:18:55,100 --> 02:18:55,760
Fully cooler!

2891
02:18:56,320 --> 02:18:56,940
See you there!

2892
02:18:57,020 --> 02:18:57,440
See you there!

2893
02:18:58,700 --> 02:18:59,240
See you there!

2894
02:18:59,280 --> 02:18:59,500
See you there!

2895
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:03,560
Okay, one more.

2896
02:19:11,480 --> 02:19:11,820
Shrimp.

2897
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:13,940
One more.

2898
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:16,480
Good luck on the concert.

2899
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:17,020
Thank you!

2900
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:18,160
I'm gonna go...

2901
02:19:18,820 --> 02:19:19,600
...race my voice.

2902
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:22,900
They're also gonna give me, like, a little tour around the boat, so I'm very excited.

2903
02:19:24,620 --> 02:19:25,300
I'm excited.

2904
02:19:25,400 --> 02:19:25,760
I'm excited.

2905
02:19:27,320 --> 02:19:27,800
Ah!

2906
02:19:29,060 --> 02:19:30,960
What's your number one Wawa costume?

2907
02:19:33,140 --> 02:19:33,880
What the?

2908
02:19:34,260 --> 02:19:35,220
Three tuna?

2909
02:19:35,560 --> 02:19:36,400
I'll take that.

2910
02:19:39,730 --> 02:19:40,710
How'd you do that?

2911
02:19:43,270 --> 02:19:45,690
My number one Wawa costume...

2912
02:19:45,690 --> 02:19:47,950
...probably would've been the summer costume...

2913
02:19:49,090 --> 02:19:49,730
...until...

2914
02:19:49,730 --> 02:19:51,950
...her, like, night outfit.

2915
02:19:52,150 --> 02:19:53,430
I love that one so much.

2916
02:19:56,770 --> 02:19:57,750
So good.

2917
02:20:01,710 --> 02:20:02,590
So, so good.

2918
02:20:02,730 --> 02:20:04,110
The night one is so awesome.

2919
02:20:08,210 --> 02:20:09,590
I love the hair so much.

2920
02:20:09,630 --> 02:20:10,130
Me too!

2921
02:20:10,570 --> 02:20:11,650
Me too, me too!

2922
02:20:11,770 --> 02:20:13,150
Oh, the exercise outfit?

2923
02:20:13,390 --> 02:20:13,810
Oh my gosh.

2924
02:20:16,090 --> 02:20:16,510
That's...

2925
02:20:16,510 --> 02:20:16,850
Okay.

2926
02:20:17,950 --> 02:20:19,350
The exercise outfit?

2927
02:20:19,390 --> 02:20:20,350
That was like...

2928
02:20:26,190 --> 02:20:27,470
Everybody's seen the 3D.

2929
02:20:27,470 --> 02:20:27,470
Fan 3D.

2930
02:20:27,610 --> 02:20:29,490
I'm so glad that she could use that.

2931
02:20:30,950 --> 02:20:33,830
That she could use that, like, fan 3D.

2932
02:20:39,010 --> 02:20:40,470
I feel like...

2933
02:20:41,050 --> 02:20:41,790
I don't know.

2934
02:20:41,950 --> 02:20:53,730
I feel like with some, like, corporate companies, they can be kind of strict on like, what type of fan models are allowed and stuff like that.

2935
02:20:53,970 --> 02:21:04,430
So that's why you see, like, a lot of corporate YouTubers using, like, chibi 3D models and stuff in, like, streams and things.

2936
02:21:04,630 --> 02:21:05,090
So...

2937
02:21:08,290 --> 02:21:12,450
So I'm really happy that they allowed her to use it.

2938
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:24,250
Yeah...

2939
02:21:27,370 --> 02:21:29,250
Secretly Management wanted to see her in it too.

2940
02:21:31,310 --> 02:21:34,090
I don't know how it works in the video.

2941
02:21:34,530 --> 02:21:35,810
I know for, like...

2942
02:21:36,970 --> 02:21:38,030
Maybe other companies?

2943
02:21:39,470 --> 02:21:39,870
Umm...

2944
02:21:41,090 --> 02:21:42,470
It's like a special...

2945
02:21:42,470 --> 02:21:42,970
It's like a...

2946
02:21:42,970 --> 02:21:45,050
You have to, like, earn the...

2947
02:21:46,630 --> 02:21:47,030
The...

2948
02:21:47,530 --> 02:21:48,990
Other outfits in 3D.

2949
02:21:49,450 --> 02:21:50,210
Kind of deal.

2950
02:21:51,470 --> 02:21:52,550
Have fun on the boat tonight!

2951
02:21:52,770 --> 02:21:54,530
Looking forward to the casino on the next update.

2952
02:21:54,690 --> 02:21:54,970
Yeah!

2953
02:21:55,810 --> 02:21:56,450
Yeah, yeah.

2954
02:22:04,580 --> 02:22:05,380
Commander Church!

2955
02:22:05,540 --> 02:22:06,220
Welcome to Mambo Chef!

2956
02:22:06,420 --> 02:22:06,660
Thank you!

2957
02:22:09,020 --> 02:22:10,100
Yeah, so...

2958
02:22:10,100 --> 02:22:13,040
If they're just like... If you, like, want to use a different outfit for...

2959
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:15,440
For...

2960
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:17,760
A 3D...

2961
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:19,200
Uh...

2962
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:21,480
You either pay or earn it.

2963
02:22:21,620 --> 02:22:22,100
So...

2964
02:22:22,100 --> 02:22:23,080
You know...

2965
02:22:23,080 --> 02:22:24,780
They don't want...

2966
02:22:26,720 --> 02:22:29,640
Other models looking too similar to...

2967
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:32,240
The real outfit... The real thing.

2968
02:22:32,320 --> 02:22:33,480
Unless it's chibi, you know?

2969
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:35,380
For some... From what I've heard.

2970
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:37,260
From what I've heard.

2971
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:40,320
Hmm...

2972
02:22:41,820 --> 02:22:42,300
So...

2973
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:46,080
Yeah...

2974
02:22:47,300 --> 02:22:47,780
Umm...

2975
02:22:48,480 --> 02:22:48,960
Yeah!

2976
02:22:51,300 --> 02:22:51,780
Allegedly.

2977
02:22:53,020 --> 02:22:53,500
Allegedly.

2978
02:22:55,860 --> 02:22:57,340
A new update was announced.

2979
02:22:57,560 --> 02:22:58,560
Oh, they're working on it.

2980
02:22:58,600 --> 02:22:59,240
I don't think it was...

2981
02:22:59,240 --> 02:23:01,280
Announced when it will be out.

2982
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:03,120
Sorry if my...

2983
02:23:03,480 --> 02:23:04,680
Title is a little misleading.

2984
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:06,020

Maybe you weren't respectful.

3029
02:24:33,110 --> 02:24:37,310
I just was gaming and I couldn't see you guys calling me an idiot.

3041
02:25:01,530 --> 02:25:05,370
That way you can yell your advice for real and I'll hear it.

3042
02:25:05,430 --> 02:25:05,650
Okay?

3176

Don't forget to use code Boomer for 10% off gamer stuff.

3188
02:29:09,550 --> 02:29:10,230
You guys.

3189
02:29:10,310 --> 02:29:13,170
I haven't forgotten about the codes that they give me.

3190
02:29:14,310 --> 02:29:16,830
Remember for my for my anniversary.

3191
02:29:17,050 --> 02:29:17,850
They gave me codes.

3192
02:29:18,370 --> 02:29:19,830
I just have been so busy.

3193
02:29:19,950 --> 02:29:24,470
I literally haven't even been able to get the raffle set up.

3194
02:29:25,730 --> 02:29:27,850
I literally still have those though.

3195
02:29:27,990 --> 02:29:28,650
They don't expire.

3196
02:29:28,910 --> 02:29:29,410
They told me.

3197
02:29:29,570 --> 02:29:31,470
I just have to set everything up.

3198
02:29:31,470 --> 02:29:32,210
I'm so.

3199
02:29:32,450 --> 02:29:33,230

3201
02:29:36,730 --> 02:29:37,450
I'm sorry.

3202
02:29:37,650 --> 02:29:38,450
But I still have them.

3203
02:29:38,710 --> 02:29:40,290
Maybe I'll use them for my 3.0.

3204
02:29:40,350 --> 02:29:40,630
I don't know.

3205
02:29:40,750 --> 02:29:42,690
They even asked me if I wanted more for my birthday.

3206
02:29:42,810 --> 02:29:43,150
And I was like.

3207
02:29:43,410 --> 02:29:44,050
Oh my god.

3208
02:29:44,730 --> 02:29:45,090
Hi.

3209
02:29:45,090 --> 02:29:45,450
Hi.

3210
02:29:45,990 --> 02:29:48,170
I haven't even used the one that you gave me first.

3211
02:29:51,090 --> 02:29:51,450
Luckily.

3212
02:29:51,950 --> 02:29:53,430
I was like thinking about it.

3213
02:29:53,510 --> 02:29:53,810
I was like.

3214
02:29:53,850 --> 02:29:54,730
This is why I don't like.

3215
02:29:55,530 --> 02:29:55,990
You know.

3216
02:29:56,290 --> 02:29:58,050
I would feel way worse if like.

3217
02:29:59,150 --> 02:29:59,710
If like.

3218
02:30:00,530 --> 02:30:01,730
The people have one.

3219
02:30:01,790 --> 02:30:03,670
And then I just forgot to send it to them.

3220
02:30:03,750 --> 02:30:03,950
You know.

3221
02:30:04,130 --> 02:30:05,010
But I don't forget.

3222
02:30:05,230 --> 02:30:05,990
I just get busy.

3223
02:30:07,590 --> 02:30:08,910
This is why I'm like.

3224
02:30:09,030 --> 02:30:09,350
You know.

3225
02:30:09,350 --> 02:30:10,290
For like everything.

3226
02:30:10,570 --> 02:30:11,630
Like my merch and everything.

3227
02:30:11,750 --> 02:30:11,970
I'm like.

3228
02:30:12,010 --> 02:30:17,810
I won't accept any money until I am 100% confident that I have everything.

3229
02:30:17,890 --> 02:30:19,050
All my ducks in a row.

3230
02:30:19,310 --> 02:30:21,130
So that there are no delays.

3231
02:30:21,390 --> 02:30:21,790
Because.

3232

Oh my gosh.

3233
02:30:22,590 --> 02:30:23,950
I'm not gonna take your money or anything.

3234
02:30:24,650 --> 02:30:26,190
And then you'll be waiting forever.

3235
02:30:27,650 --> 02:30:28,050
So.

3236
02:30:28,190 --> 02:30:29,410
Can I post in chat yet?

3237
02:30:34,390 --> 02:30:34,790
So.

Alright.

Right.

02:30:58,390 --> 02:30:58,790
Right.

02:30:58,990 --> 02:30:59,390
Right.
