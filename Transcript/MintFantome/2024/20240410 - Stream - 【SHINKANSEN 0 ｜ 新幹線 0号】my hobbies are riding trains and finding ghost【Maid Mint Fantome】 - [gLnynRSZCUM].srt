know, I like trains.

39
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:14,690
Um, but to say that I'm a train otaku is, I think, greatly
over-exaggerating how much I know about trains.

40
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,570
Because I, uh, um, I just like to ride them.

41
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,430

00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,110

00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,070
The next station is Yurei Machi.

95
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,770
The ghost town.

96
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:51,470
For real.

97
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:59,650
This game is one of those games where you have like the
anomalies that you have to spot.

98
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,550
Um, right?

99
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:13,210
pretty sure that's all you do and you try to escape the
train is what I imagine I kind of like the ones where you

100
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:20,790
have to find the anomalies I actually really like hidden
object games and things like that so um these kind of

101
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:32,250
scratch like a certain itch that I really enjoy like
observation duty I think so I think so is this like the exit

102
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:40,890
game I'm pretty sure, but, but, um, but on a train.

103
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,530
Mm-mm-mm.

104
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,330
Were you an I-spy book enjoyer when you were young?

105
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:45,930
Absolutely.

106
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:46,890
Oh my gosh.

107
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,050
Oh my gosh.

108
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,190
You just, oh my gosh.

109
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,310
You just unlocked a memory for me.

110
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:57,850
I, uh, another children's game that I would play all the
time was the I-spy spooky mansion.

111
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:02,850
Like I own, I didn't own any of the other I-spy games on the
computer.

112
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:16,190
I only owned the spooky the haunted mansion one and I really
liked when the skeleton would crawl around it was so fun oh

113
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:23,230
my gosh maybe I can find a way to stream that one too I'm
gonna have to I'm gonna have to like buy a windows 95

114
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,910
computer or something to be able to run these games

115
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,950
hmm I didn't have the book I only had the game, the computer
game.

116
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,390
But it was so fun.

117
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:37,950
It was so fun.

118
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,290
It's so awesome.

119
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,550
So thank you for unlocking that memory.

120
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,770
Actually, there was like at the end of the game when you
beat it, like the skeleton, I think he would like crawl out

121
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,850
of the chimney.

122
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,910
And I always loved that part.

123
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,170
The spooky skeleton host was cool.

124
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,490
Yeah, he would be in every puzzle.

125
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,150
So fun.

126
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:10,770
horror edutainment I loved I I'm telling you I don't think
I've changed much from when I was a kid I've always loved

127
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:20,910
horror so much I've always been like this where if something
was like spooky themed I'd be like that's my favorite

128
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:33,910
Halloween was the best time ever for me especially because
my parents would get really into it too my dad loved

129
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:42,510
decorating the house and um there was even like some some
special halloween decorations that he like created himself

130
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:51,230
and then even when i got older um him and our neighbor uh
the neighbor they would like at the neighbor's house they

131
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:57,610
would help my dad would help the neighbor set up a haunted
mansion in the neighbor's house for like kids to go through

132
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:07,790
and stuff as a kid um well i wasn't really a kid at that
time but so uh yeah i just had a family that also loved um

133
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:18,950
halloween so maybe that also influenced me i don't know i
don't really know i'm just i'm just not like other other

134
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:33,050

Whatever the word is.

138
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:42,350
Whoa, the sensitivity on this is kind of insane.

139
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

140
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,250
Settings of sensitivity.

141
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,310
Let's put it down like here.

142
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,570
Let's do crosshair also so you guys can see what I'm looking
at.

143
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:55,670
Okay.

144
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,390
Where's the crosshair?

145
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:01,990
Never mind.

146
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,110
That was volume?

147
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,590
No, are you kidding me?

148
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:06,230
Oh.

149
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,390
Oh.

150
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:14,350
Oh.

151
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,470
I thought I...

152
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,790
It's so funny because even after I changed it, I was like,
that's much better.

153
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,910
Okay, that's action.

154
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:26,530
That's better.

155
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,190
I...

156
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,530
I, uh, what's, I, uh, placebo affected myself.

157
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,810
Oh, that's funny.

158
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,150
Okay.

159
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:41,970
Ooh, oh.

160
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,370
Oh, nothing.

161
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,510
Grandma!

162
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,890
Why does this look so strange?

163
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,870
Why does this look?

164
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,130
Why does she look just AI generated or something?

165
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,570
Mm-hmm.

166
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,470
Hey, it's Matara.

167
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,510
Hey, don't say that.

168
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,850
What's the rules?

169
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,750

170
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,150
Any recommendations for beginners?

171
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:14,470
Oh, gosh.

172
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:20,350
Halloween is, like, such an awesome time to go, because
there's so many...

173
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,330
Oh, who's in there?

174
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,290
There's so many shows going on.

175
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,590
It's harder to say, only because I feel like you should...

176
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:31,390
Ah!

177
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,770
There's the crosshairs.

178
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:44,150
It's easier to know the idol group and...

179
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,210
Um...

180
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,850
And like, find them that way.

181
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:50,930
You know?

182
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,310
Thank you.

183
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,900
Perhaps you'll be interested in playing short horror games
from Ich-Icho someday.

184
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,020
There's a couple of really good ones.

185
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,340
Yeah, yeah.

186
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,120
For sure, for sure, for sure.

187
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:16,320
Maybe we can do like, um, like a group of, like, short
horror games, kind of, like, play, like, I don't know, three

188
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,160
or four or something in a stream.

189
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,300
Mm-hmm.

190
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,060
Um, okay.

191
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,300
I can't see where I'm clicking.

192
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,660
This way, right?

193
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,120
Oh.

194
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,160
Wait, what if I try opening this one?

195
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,920
Oh, my bad.

196
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:47,420
open I can't tell is there a crosshair or not I'm not crazy
right I can't tell where I'm clicking I'm just curious oh

197
00:17:47,420 --> 00:18:02,580
this home alone kid oh my god what is this ad on the train
sorry my my don't know sound scared me okay here we go oh

198
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,520
turn back if There is an anomaly.

199
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,600
Speaking of itch.io horror games, I would die of happiness
if you played Voices of the Void.

200
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,400
Never heard of...

201
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,460
Oh my god!

202
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,360
Cat Cafe!

203
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,420
You guys, I'm gonna be honest.

204
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:20,920
Cat cafes?

205
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,740
I went to a couple while I was in Japan.

206
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,900
And they're just not worth it.

207
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:34,380
Even, like, it never scratched that itch that I had of
wanting cat time.

208
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,400
And usually the cats are like, are so uninterested because
they're messed with all the time.

209
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,140
You know what I mean?

210
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:48,760
So it's just, there is one that I like to go to called Neco
Jalala in Akihabara.

211
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,340
It's kind of like off the path.

212
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,900
So it's good.

213
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,760
Is that a person?

214
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,420
Oh no.

215
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,340
Oh, there's an anomaly.

216
00:18:59,520 --> 00:18:59,900
Turn back.

217
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:00,700
Turn back.

218
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,040
Turn back.

219
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,460
Turn back.

220
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,250
So I go here.

221
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:08,970
Oh!

222
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,290
Oh, wait.

223
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,350
Hmm?

224
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,770
People aren't anomalies.

225
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,110
Uh, you say that.

226
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,650
They are to me.

227
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,250
To be fair, that's how owning a cat is, too, most of the
time.

228
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,230
I don't...

229
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,610
No, my cat is very...

230
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,130
Can I crouch?

231
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,870
No.

232
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:31,910
Can I run?

233
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,170
I...

234
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:33,450
Uh-oh.

235
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:33,930
Uh-oh.

236
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,650
You could run.

237
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,250
Okay.

238
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:36,590
Okay.

239
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,650
I'm a salary man.

240
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
Oh my God, this guy is balding.

241
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,400
Oh, he kind of looks like broccoli.

242
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,020
Hey, wake up.

243
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,740
Are you an anomaly?

244
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,420
Sorry.

245
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,080
I'm afraid to click on him.

246
00:19:59,620 --> 00:19:59,960
Are you?

247
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:00,720
Okay.

248
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,040
Okay, we're fine.

249
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,020
Run, run, run.

250
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,020
He's gonna chase us.

251
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,120
Oh my God, he's chasing us!

252
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,380
Okay, are there anomalies in here too or...

253
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:18,600
Wait!

254
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,700
Is that suitcase supposed to be there?

255
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,020
Ah!

256
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:21,860
I'm sorry.

257
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,540
Oh my god.

258
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,440
Why are you looking at me, kid?

259
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,720
Is your mom okay?

260
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,400
Why are you looking at me?

261
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,890
I can't tell if the game has started or not.

262
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,510
We're still at 7!

263
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,550
Am I doing...

264
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,390
Am I playing the game correctly?

265
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,270
Oh, sorry.

266
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,290
Sorry, I thought he got up.

267
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,790
Talk to the kid.

268
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,250
I tried clicking on him.

269
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,690
Wait, where are they?

270
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,710
Oh, here, here, here.

271
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:09,910
Okay.

272
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,370
Oh, God.

273
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,990
I don't even get to go because I'm too...

274
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:16,750
jumpy, you guys.

275
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,410
Hold on.

276
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,750
I had some coffee earlier.

277
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,350
I think it's making me a little...

278
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:20,590
Hold on.

279
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,310
I'm going to keep eating my Goku Reese's Puff cereal.

280
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,310
Mm-hmm.

281
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:25,850
Okay.

282
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,750
I'm so sorry.

283
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,010
I'm a little jumpy because of the caffeine, I think.

284
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:46,170
I've heard they don't even serve real cat at a cat cafe.

285
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,870
It's some kind of mock cat.

286
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,550
Stop!

287
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,330
How dare you!

288
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,250
That kid was staring at an anomaly.

289
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,590
Would you be interested in playing Lifeline?

290
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,870
It's a voice-controlled horror game.

291
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:07,990
Clippers would go mad.

292
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:08,370
Oh!

293
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:09,830
That sounds fun.

294
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,810
Yeah, I'd totally be interested in that.

295
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,950
Today we learned that kids scare the ectoplasm out of
ghosts.

296
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,910
I'm just, you know...

297
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,290
Walking between cards.

298
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,910
I'm being a menace.

299
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,150
Wait.

300
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,010
Wait, looping?

301
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,410
Oh, sorry, I should be reading this.

302
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,850
I think I'm walking a little bit of it.

303
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,430
I'm super excited.

304
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:44,830
I was really bored here because my sister's not waking up.

305
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,430
Oh, I wonder why.

306
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,230
No matter how long I wait.

307
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:04,030
But now that I have you to play the game, I feel better.

308
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,590
So he's looping also.

309
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,550
Do you know the rules of the game?

310
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:09,990
I don't know.

311
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,630
The rules are simple.

312
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,870
See something off in the train?

313
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,730
Turn back.

314
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,890
You know, maybe you should subtitle the whole thing so I
know, you know, that you're not going to keep talking.

315
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,330
Want to finish the game?

316
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:38,350
Get to car zero and hit the brakes in the conductor's room.

317
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,790
That explains that.

318
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,730
There are no anomalies in the restroom.

319
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,590
That sounds fake.

320
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,870
Why can I open the door then?

321
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,450
anomalies in the restroom area.

322
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,850
Why can I open the door?

323
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,030
And why is it in green?

324
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,130
Kind of sus.

325
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,630
Got it?

326
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:07,990
Yes, I got it.

327
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:08,930
Good.

328
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,410
I'm not dealing with an idiot.

329
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:11,970
Yo kata.

330
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,450
I'll see you at the end then.

331
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,030
The end of the world or...

332
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,270
Okay, kid.

333
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,790
And to you too, little lady.

334
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,110
I like her dress.

335
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,810
Looks like something I would wear, actually.

336
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,440
Hmm.

337
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,560
But what if it, like, opens, you know?

338
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,560
I don't know.

339
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,160
Oh.

340
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:43,880
Eh?

341
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,900
Isn't this the same as before?

342
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:49,820
Huh?

343
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,980
Mr. Oh!

344
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,620
I'm scared to talk to him.

345
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,380
Now it starts.

346
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,780
So, what kind of thing would count as an anomaly?

347
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:06,820
Like...

348
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,540
Um...

349
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,660
What are they still here?

350
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,220
I wonder.

351
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:11,740
Oh, gosh.

352
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,010
Looks like an anomaly.

353
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:22,450

00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,150
The kid turned into a lump of flesh!

357
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,070
Wait, is this an anomaly or...

358
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,790

359
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:36,930

00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,150
Hey kid, are you okay up there?

00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:52,530

are getting more and more expensive for places and now these

362
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:56,910

like the economy.

367
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,750
Um, oh, I'm scared.

368
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,550
Numbers are counting.

369
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:59,290
Seven?

370
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,090
Seven!

371
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,530
Maybe I'm tripping.

372
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,470
Okay, it's back to being a suitcase.

373
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,490
A sister is still asleep.

374
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,090
Uh...

375
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,230
Uh, nurse.

376
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,850
I don't know how much of this I need to remember.

377
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,150
Oh, gosh.

378
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,470
Look everywhere.

379
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,010
Okay.

380
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,970
The numbers are numbering.

381
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:25,430
Yes.

382
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,930
He got folded like an omelette.

383
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:29,770
The...

384
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,490
Okay, I think the game...

385
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,710
I think it's just the game doing that.

386
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,950
These look... Everything looks normal.

387
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,030
Anything under the seats?

388
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:46,570
Anyone forget a soda in the seats or anything?

389
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,090
This guy's still got his shoes.

390
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:49,310
Oh!

391
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:50,730
Oh, never mind.

392
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:51,290
Hello?

393
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,030
Oh, he's awake!

394
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,170
Is he?

395
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,310
Actually, I can't tell.

396
00:27:58,990 --> 00:27:59,330
Are you?

397
00:27:59,570 --> 00:27:59,910
Okay.

398
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,670
I think we're good.

399
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,470
Take his shoes.

400
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:16,920
then it won't be an anomaly what how will we know if it's an
anomaly or not if we take his shoes

401
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:30,030
one last look of things i don't see anything in the windows
like if there's a creature following me i don't know if

402
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:42,970
that's a thing either we continue onward no anomaly in this
area okay if you if you say so i don't believe you What?

403
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,370
What did I miss?

404
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,370
No way!

405
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,850
What did I miss?

406
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,130
It looked so normal.

407
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,290
Okay, it's fine.

408
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,090
It's fine.

409
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:54,890
We just started.

410
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:57,990
I don't care.

411
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:00,590
It's fine.

412
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,950
Check the windows.

413
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,350
I have been looking.

414
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,550
Like, do I have to check each window individually?

415
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,030
Hmm.

416
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:09,870
Hmm.

417
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:10,690
Hmm.

418
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:16,190
Hmm, it's so quiet, the ambience scares me.

419
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,070
Um, this is a suitcase and...

420
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,510
She's gone!

421
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,530
She's gone!

422
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,810
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

423
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,950
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

424
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:29,170
Come up!

425
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,010
Ah!

426
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,200
Six!

427
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,060
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

428
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,620
Okay, we're going to Tokyo!

429
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,100
Okay.

430
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,720
Hmm.

431
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,060
He's still got his shoes.

432
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,140
Everything seems okay.

433
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,780
The seats are proper.

434
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,360
Oh!

435
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,140
Wait!

436
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,660
What's so funny?

437
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:04,960
Yeah!

438
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,400
Okay, she's here!

439
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,360
She's here, she's here.

440
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:24,420
I'm scared Headed to Tokyo I don't know like how small the
details will be Like these Sometimes it's hard to say with

441
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:30,780
these observation games Because sometimes they're like You
need to know Did I hear a footstep?

442
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:41,760
No I didn't hear a footstep right Oh Oh Oh Okay, let's look
at the windows.

443
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,240
Look at my strut.

444
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,020
Oh, I'm stuck on something.

445
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,680
Oh, it looks normal, but it looked normal before, too.

446
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:18,750
I don't know why I'm so impressed that He is also in this
reflection as well.

447
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,190
Maybe because, I don't know.

448
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:26,430
It's just, like, a small detail that I didn't think they
would pay attention to.

449
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:30,670
I don't know.

450
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,790
I think we're good, you guys.

451
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,730
I think we're good to move forward.

452
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:35,850
Right?

453
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,150
Yeah, there she is.

454
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,350
She's still asleep.

455
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,310
Hmm.

456
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,050
Reflections.

457
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,810
I've been looking.

458
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,630
Do I have to go down the whole thing?

459
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,830
Look at me.

460
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,990
I look like I'm so vain, like I just love looking at my
reflection.

461
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,750
Like, why am I posing for the camera?

462
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,650
Yeah, it looks normal.

463
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:10,610
Yeah!

464
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:17,270
Tokyo!

465
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:18,930
Tokyo Calling!

466
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,490
Tokyo Calling!

467
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,990
Tokyo Calling!

468
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:24,790
Five!

469
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,670
It looks a little darker.

470
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,650
Is it just me?

471
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,270
Heading to Tokyo.

472
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,870
Do you guys know that song?

473
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,390
Tokyo Calling by Atarashi Gakko.

474
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,550
Hello, mister.

475
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,970
Just making sure you're okay.

476
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,230
It looks darker here, right?

477
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,250
It definitely looks darker right there.

478
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,490
Maybe that's the anomaly.

479
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,940
I do, I was obsessed with it for like a week.

480
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,580
Yeah, it's so good.

481
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:24,340
When is it the game being the game?

482
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,860
And when is it...

483
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,700
Oh, she's here.

484
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,400
No, I think maybe it isn't darker.

485
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,840
imagination.

486
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:34,680
Ah!

487
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,350
Fly!

488
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,880
Shinkansen Zero headed to Tokyo!

489
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,900
One day, what if it says headed to hell?

490
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,360
I feel like one of the anomalies has to be that, right?

491
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,840
I also have a question.

492
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:24,280
is this a game where it's always random or is it a game
where each level is always the same because i know with some

493
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:30,240
of these you have to like play them over and over again to
see all the different kinds of anomalies oh it is random

494
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,080
cool cool

495
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:49,390
oh i'm too afraid to get close to him i'm afraid of people
okay So now we have to make a one, we have to make a lap up

496
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:53,570
and down to make sure there's no seat people.

497
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,610
What if he grabbed, what if he grabbed me?

498
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:05,490
Okay, all right, all right, and let's look this way.

499
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:09,130
We're looking at the reflections, too.

500
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,030
We're making sure there's no one here.

501
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,130
Looking at the reflections and the chairs.

502
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:20,690
Okay.

503
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,010
Okay.

504
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:32,430
Hello, Mr. Hope you're doing well.

505
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:36,590
Just stay right there.

506
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,130
Looks like almost Ronald McDonald was in the seat.

507
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:43,930
Was it that?

508
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,450
The guy sitting there last time?

509
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,210
I think we're good.

510
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:52,270
I think we are okay to move on.

511
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,690
It always feels weirder that there's no anomalies than there
being an anomaly.

512
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:57,410
You know what I mean?

513
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:03,470
Hmm.

514
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,970
Let's go.

515
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,790
Was that flickering meaning that I messed up?

516
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,190
Am I gonna have to hide in the bathroom at some point?

517
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:20,810
Oh!

518
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,830
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

519
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,810
Okay, headed to Tokyo!

520
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:29,250
Alrighty!

521
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,070
Very good, very good, very good, very good.

522
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,650
I like psyched myself out.

523
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,910
I'm like, what if he's gonna lunge at me?

524
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,470
What if he's- what if I want to- Chew!

525
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,370
The anomaly is there's a cute ghost on this train.

526
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:49,570
Where?

527
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,060
Oh gosh, I'm scared.

528
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,330
Okay, she's here.

529
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,150
Alright.

530
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,550
There has to be something here, though.

531
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:05,950
Alright.

532
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,450
There's gotta be something.

533
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,470
Behind me!

534
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,480
What's behind me?

535
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,560
Where?

536
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,120
Where?

537
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,440
What's behind me?

538
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,620
Under there.

539
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,440
Under where?

540
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,440
Okay, let's start here.

541
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,020
I think it's the issues.

542
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,540
I don't know what all kind of anomalies we can get.

543
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,040
You know?

544
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,780
Shoes still on.

545
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,500
Suitcase.

546
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,700
It's better not to bring, like, your suitcase, though.

547
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,700
on because you know it takes up a lot of space.

548
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,740
That's not such a big one.

549
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,320
I mean you can always store it above too.

550
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,860
.

551
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,780
.

552
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,640
.

553
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,260
.

554
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,680
.

555
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,540
.

556
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:31,720
.

557
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,060
.

558
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,040
.

559
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,760
I don't know, you guys.

560
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,000
I think this one looks good, too.

561
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,920
Do they serve food on these trains?

562
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,940
Usually, yeah.

563
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,920
Usually, yeah.

564
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,720
But, like, it's not, like, you have to buy it.

565
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,600
It's not, like, international flight or sometimes when they
give you food.

566
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,260
Suitcase missing?

567
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,320
No, it's up there.

568
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,640
Someone said one of the lights was flashing.

569
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,420
Is that true?

570
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,140
Or was that just the game being silly?

571
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,100
I'll check again.

572
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,640
Was that the game?

573
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,720
I can't tell if the light adjusting is the game or...

574
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,800
Let's see.

575
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,400
Okay.

576
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:24,840
Okay.

577
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,180
Like I'm...

578
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:27,480
Okay.

579
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,640
Okay.

580
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,540
Okay.

581
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,740
Getting through these seats.

582
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:35,760
My God.

583
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,040
See you like that!

584
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,720
See you like...

585
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,760
Okay, flashing light, maybe.

586
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,740
I don't know what that would even mean.

587
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,120
Okay, okay.

588
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,560
I think we're good.

589
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,540
I think I'm being a little paranoid, but...

590
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,420
Well, it's fine.

591
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,340
Oh, God!

592
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,580
Jeez!

593
00:39:59,180 --> 00:39:59,700
Okay.

594
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:00,400
Alright.

595
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,600
This says no anomalies in this area, but I don't believe it.

596
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:13,940
Oh!

597
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,280
I think I see the anomaly.

598
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,320
Why is she get to sit down, but he's standing up?

599
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,820
Also, he's huge!

600
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,440
He's ginormous!

601
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,280
Do you think he'll come at me?

602
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,800
Is she looking at me?

603
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:43,940
No.

604
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,480
Can't tell.

605
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,960
Go say hi.

606
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,780
It looks like the inside of a plane.

607
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,440
He eats his broccoli every day.

608
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:09,440
They need to clean the middle of the cart a little bit
better.

609
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,130
No,

610
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,610
she looks the same as before, I think.

611
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,590
She's still like moving her head around.

612
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:28,390
I'm scared.

613
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:29,850
Is he gonna come after me?

614
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,190
I don't want to lose.

615
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,550
You guys were on cart, too!

616
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:34,750
We're so close!

617
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,130
Look out the window.

618
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,810
Well, it's just normal.

619
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:39,770
It's just me.

620
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,630
It's just me.

621
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,630
Oh my god, you can see him standing there, though.

622
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:49,250
This guy is an absolute unit.

623
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:52,610
His torso is so long!

624
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,470
Wait, how tall are we?

625
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,490
Okay, I don't want him to come after me, but I want to
compare our heights.

626
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,590
I have a bit of a complex, okay?

627
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:03,710
Armstrong, real.

628
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,030
Don't turn around!

629
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:11,930
Don't do it!

630
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,000
His torso is so long!

631
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,580
I just want to see what he looks like, you know?

632
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,850
Don't look at me.

633
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,090
He's got boobs.

634
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,840
Oh my god.

635
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:53,090
My curiosity has been satiated.

636
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:00,350
One, baby!

637
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,270
Yippee!

638
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:08,350
This is Shinkansen Zero headed to Tokyo!

639
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:20,350
See, don't you feel more comfortable sitting and relaxing
and...

640
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:23,230
Mm-hmm.

641
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:36,990
that looks like a suitcase let's get to the end of the cart
and assess before we do anything else any other people that

Platform shoes?

648
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,720
I don't know if they're exactly platform shoes, but...

649
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,860
The Tom Cruise special.

650
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,980
How tall is Tom Cruise?

651
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,600
I feel very short on this.

652
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,760
Like my character.

653
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,200
Wait, this looks normal, you guys.

654
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,740
You guys, this looks normal.

655
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,540

00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:53,860
Hmm.

657
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,710

i can't do like if they were like that before or not okay
check the reflection.

661
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:39,710
I'm checking my reflection.

662
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:42,210
There were no other people in the sea.

663
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:42,690
It's right.

664
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:44,130
I didn't miss it.

665
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:45,670
I didn't miss anyone, right?

666
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:53,850
The strut.

667
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:54,290
I know.

668
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:54,810
Look at me.

Go.

I

671
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,460
look like I'm such a child.

672
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,040
I didn't pay attention at all, but I'm just gonna believe.

673
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:29,060
I can't tell if they were playing like this before oh look

this is a plain Jane train.

676
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,700
Alrighty.

677
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:01,610
No turning back.

678
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,080
No way.

679
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,220
Headed to Tokyo?

680
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:11,980
We did it?

681
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:13,920
Did I beat the game?

682
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,260
Hey, kid.

683
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:19,840
Um.

684
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:51,570
Are we okay?

685
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:53,290
Everybody?

686
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,600
That didn't scare us at all, did it?

687
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,660
We were fine.

688
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,260
We were totally whatever.

689
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,500
Wait, do I need to turn back on this one?

690
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,200
Are there anomalies here?

691
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,320
It doesn't say if there's an anomaly turned back.

692
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,320
Song suggestions, I think you'd slay at.

693
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,540
Oh, I do know melodies of life.

694
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:33,860
I'll check it out, thank you.

695
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,120
I've been able to catch many streams due to work.

696
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,900
It's okay, I've only done like three.

697
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,820
Congrats on another episode of the podcast.

698
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,300
Thank you so much, thank you.

699
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,460
Good luck with work!

700
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,640
Wait, so I can just go forward here?

701
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,100
Just go forward?

702
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:53,620
Okay.

703
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:08,420
What's happening?

704
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,460
What's going on?

705
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:09,820
Children?

706
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:10,260
Children?

707
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:10,680
Where's going?

708
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,880
What's happening?

709
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:12,240
Where?

710
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,400
What's going on?

711
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,880
What's happening?

712
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:24,900
We stopped momentarily due to an injury.

713
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,260
Oh.

714
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:34,480
There is no plan for the train to stop at this moment.

715
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,420
Wait, what do you mean?

716
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,420
Please excuse the delay.

717
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,320
Attention, please.

718
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:40,480
Oh.

719
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,280
We have stopped the momentary due to one injury.

720
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:48,140
There is no plan for the train to stop at this moment.

721
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,480
Please excuse the delay.

722
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,500
Thank you.

723
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:53,680
Wait.

724
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,060
was it you

725
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:08,430

726
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:19,930
oh I just go inside okay just kidding one second

727
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,920
one second

728
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:41,650
oh clear Clear blue car.

729
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:42,770
Oh, wait.

730
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:46,350
What do you mean?

731
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:47,650
Clear blue car.

732
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:52,230
What do you mean by that?

733
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:52,590
Ah!

734
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:55,510
Why did you...

735
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:58,950
Did you wash your hands?

736
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:05,570
Mr. Looks like you made it!

737
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:08,790
Oh, doctor.

738
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:10,330
Why did she translate this?

739
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:16,130
You thought this was the conductor's room?

740
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:18,530
Oh no, your prince, this isn't another castle!

741
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:22,850
You're only halfway there!

742
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:29,050
It's the green one.

743
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:33,630
I never specified which car zero you have to get to.

744
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:39,190
Don't you know, Shinkansen's have green car?

745
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:51,650
You know, where the premium seats are?

746
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,410
That's literally what I talked about.

747
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:56,590
The greens cars.

748
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:00,190
If you're an adult, you should know that.

749
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:07,570
You have to go through the green cars to get to the
conductor's room.

750
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:17,490
What he says versus what is written here is so funny.

751
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:24,850
The way he has such confidence in English, but he was just
like, my explanation might have been kind of bad.

752
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,610
But here he's just like, duh.

753
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:32,910
The confidence they give him is so funny.

754
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,070
Whoa, what's that?

755
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:37,890
Why is there a spaghetti?

756
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:40,610
I mean, pukam pukam pukam pukam pukam

757
00:52:47,280 --> 00:53:05,480
Oh Whoopsie We have stopped the train due to an injury a
passenger has suffered shattered eardrums due to

758
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,040
high-pitched screaming I'm sorry.

759
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:20,920
I'm sorry Oh, by the way Oh, sorry I didn't I was listening
on the green car oh when you find an up an anomaly go

760
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,120
forward instead of walking back

761
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:37,160
what what do you mean there's an abac and then it will come
what do you mean one more thing if you make three mistakes

762
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,540
the ghost will get you

763
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,020
Um...

764
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:54,800
Why is the subtitles, like, not synced with what he's
saying?

765
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,920
Hey, Mr. Have you ever wondered why we're here?

766
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,000
Never mind.

767
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,720
What is he saying?

768
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,140
He was just kind of like...

769
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:14,580
He said basically the same thing as the... as the line
afterward.

770
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,820
Mmm, just to suffer.

771
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:28,320
I don't know who did the translation, but it's just kind of
weird that like when he talks, it's like a little slightly

772
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:28,620
off.

773
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,980
Let's just clear the game first.

774
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,760
See you at Car Zero.

775
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,940
Wait, so we have to go to...

776
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,460
I wonder if my sister's awake.

777
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:46,280
Oh,

778
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,080
no, we don't need him to explain the rules.

779
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:54,800
Okay.

780
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,940
Wait, so okay, if we make three mistakes, then...

781
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:09,770
Turn back if no anomaly.

782
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:11,470
Wait, no!

783
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:17,390
Oh, yes, if there's an anomaly, we keep going.

784
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:19,310
What?

785
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:20,710
Who was that that just sat down?

786
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,510
How do I know if that's an anomaly or not?

787
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:25,250
I don't know.

788
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:27,090
Why is she coming towards me?

789
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:30,330
Lady, stay back!

790
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:31,990
Stay back, I told you!

791
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,980
Can I get through or...

792
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,940
Can I get a sandwich or...

793
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:47,920
Hello?

794
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,120
Hello?

795
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:50,920
Okay.

796
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:51,360
Okay.

797
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,160
It's really dark right there where the guys...

798
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:56,840
Ah, down!

799
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:57,720
It's dark!

800
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:58,960
It's dark and scary!

801
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:00,840
She's working.

802
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,520
We love... We love a business-oriented woman.

803
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,060
It's really dark right there!

804
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,160
I don't like it!

805
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:07,640
I don't like it!

806
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,120
I don't like it!

807
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:10,760
She's gaming.

808
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,680
She's hacking.

809
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,320
I don't like it!

810
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:15,820
I don't like it!

811
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,280
I don't like it!

812
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,660
Is it supposed to be this dark?

813
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:20,820
Why is it so dark?

814
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,000
I think the lights are actually out.

815
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,220
I think that's an anomaly, right?

816
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:28,560
Anomaly is forward.

817
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,320
So I have to go past him.

818
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,360
I have to go past him.

819
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,100
I have to go past.

820
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,140
This is normal.

821
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,420
It is.

822
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,840
The first car is okay.

823
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:45,700
Okay.

824
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,660
This is just showing me what's normal.

825
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,580
Are you sure that's normal?

826
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,060
Thank you.

827
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,060
I thought you weren't afraid of no ghost.

828
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:25,740
I said just a little.

829
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,140
Wait, is that the ghost that will get us if we make the
mistakes?

830
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:32,480
Help him out.

831
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,240
I'll give you a little lift.

832
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,600
Here, let me just, uh, tuck my hands under your tushy.

833
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:40,740
Lift!

834
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,380
Lift!

835
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,320
Wow, these seats are so nice.

836
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:54,340
Okay.

837
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,540
The ghost, this is, I'm not making a mistake, am I?

838
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:04,200
Wait, oh wait, turn back if no and um...

839
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,320
Wait, so I go this way, right?

840
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:05,800
Wait.

841
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,580
Okay, never mind.

842
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,060
Oh, it's confusing.

843
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:12,360
Okay.

844
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,280
I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it.

845
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,400
I can't tell

846
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,120
if you guys are, if you guys are trolling me or not.

847
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,440
This is normal.

848
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:44,180
I give the Terminator up in here, for real.

849
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,200
Then think for yourself.

850
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,680
No, I'm trusting you guys.

851
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,840
I'm trusting you guys.

852
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:58,150
I'm trusting you.

853
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:58,970
I'm trusting you.

854
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:01,730
No anomaly in this area.

855
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:07,150
What the hell did I miss?

856
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:08,990
Uh-oh.

857
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:09,610
Wait.

858
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:12,250
I missed a shot!

859
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:15,190
Uh-oh.

860
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,470
Uh oh.

861
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:21,870
Uh oh.

862
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:24,550
The ghost is gonna get me.

863
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:27,310
Oh.

864
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:30,570
Oh, you didn't miss anything?

865
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:31,630
Okay, okay.

866
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:34,090
Thank you!

867
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:37,470
What do you got?

868
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:39,050
What are you blind?

869
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:39,990
Damn.

870
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:43,430
Her...

871
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:45,810
Her waist?

872
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:48,670
Damn!

873
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:51,310
Damn, girl.

874
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:53,190
I'll buy whatever you're selling.

875
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:55,750
Give me them almonds.

876
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:57,930
Oh, yeah!

877
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,930
Her waist is an anomaly.

878
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:06,530
Also, oh, her toes her toes are really out.

879
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:12,370
She's, like, kind of floating.

880
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:15,590
That's okay, though.

881
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:19,790
She's got them...

882
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:20,830
She's got them...

883
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:21,890
Them healies.

884
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:25,070
Okay.

885
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:26,530
Oh.

886
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:29,110
That seems to be an anomaly.

887
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:31,630
Are you actually spying on me?

888
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:34,130
Oh my god, she did hack me.

889
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:35,530
She hacked me!

890
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:36,170
For real!

891
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:40,390
Why does it look blue on your screen?

892
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,140
Love he...

893
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:55,770
Right, wait.

894
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:57,530
Turn back if no.

895
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:58,270
You're right, right, right, right.

896
01:00:59,450 --> 01:00:59,550
Okay.

897
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:02,090
Oh, Jesus.

898
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:09,640
Oh, God, what do you want?

899
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:12,780
Ha!

900
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:18,000
Are you human?

901
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:19,780
No.

902
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,580
Uh, I hope so.

903
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,720
You can't trick me.

904
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:31,740
You're wearing a suit!

905
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,920
It's so in my ear.

906
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,500
That's strange.

907
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,780
You don't act like the others.

908
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:49,740
That much I can't tell.

909
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:54,280
He's saying that office workers are not...

910
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,000
Not human.

911
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,840
Office workers don't deserve human rights.

912
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,300
How long have been here for?

913
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,180
Ami?

914
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:08,860
You?

915
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:09,960
You?

916
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,320
We don't know.

917
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,840
How long have been here for?

918
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:14,760
It could be any of us.

919
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:18,100
How long have been here for any who?

920
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,980
I don't know.

921
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:23,000
What if?

922
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:23,800
Oh my gosh.

923
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,980
Here's my game theory.

924
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:32,180
What if this old man is the one that had the injury, the
accident?

925
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:36,160
And he is now dead limbo.

926
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,220
Oh my gosh.

927
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:42,080
I don't know.

928
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,640
Did you meet anyone in the train?

929
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,220
A boy?

930
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,160
That's a good one.

931
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:55,880
That's good.

932
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,520
From my observation.

933
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:08,040
And from my 84 years of experience?

934
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,620
Seems like most people here are not actual humans.

935
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,680
This guy is so close.

936
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,800
This is like how actual old people are, man.

937
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,900
He's giving me that lead stare.

938
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,940
It's good, come on.

939
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,080
The lead-paint stare, please, sir.

940
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:35,500
They never respond when I talk to them.

941
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,660
They're almost like...

942
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,400
Robots.

943
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,660
I know a human when I see one.

944
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:51,520
So my conclusion is...

945
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,040
Never trust the men...

946
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:58,520
In suits.

947
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,640
That lady, she was also wearing a suit.

948
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,600
Now if you'll let me...

949
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:04,940
Oh.

950
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,080
I'm tired.

951
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:13,620
I'm tired.

952
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,840
Let me just sleep.

953
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,660
He's like acting like we're the men in black or something.

954
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,300
Before I...

955
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:22,820
Before I...

956
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:24,060
Oh.

957
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:38,620
before you what sir oh wait what happened to his face sir
are you okay oh oh nah he's just asleep

958
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:54,410
I think we're okay it does say that there's no anomalies in
this area so for him to be in this area means he truly is

959
01:04:54,410 --> 01:05:01,990
not an anomaly ah I'm going to grab a cough drop real quick.

960
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:06,720
So sorry if you hear it.

961
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:13,070
I think I need one because of how spooked I'm getting.

962
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:16,810
Wait, are any of these open?

963
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:18,050
Oh, yes, this one is.

964
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:18,870
Okay.

965
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:23,590
What flavor is it?

966
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:26,250
It's just...

967
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:27,470
It's not really any flavor.

968
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:30,650
It's just...

969
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:44,150
menthol cough drop ASMR do you like that do you like hearing
me open my bag and I have like a little baggie of cough

Yeah.

975
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:05,250
Yeah.

976
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:08,910
Oh, God.

977
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:10,870
I don't like the way it sits every time.

978
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:17,870
Mm-hmm.

979
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:21,210
You can use the phone?

980
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:22,010
You can?

981
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:23,470
Oh, I shouldn't turn back, though.

982
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:27,740
What does that sound?

983
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:31,060
Okay.

984
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:33,760

All these teats have faces on them Oh what?

992
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:11,360
They kind of look like...

993
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,100
No they don't

994
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,340
What faces?

995
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,180
I don't see anything in the...

996
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,500
What is that, like, bar?

997
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,420
Maybe it's just a reflection of the light.

998
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,900
Oh, it's so...

999
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:31,240
Wait.

1000
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,340
Okay, that's also a reflection.

1001
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,980
I thought I saw, like, someone leaning out from a seat.

1002
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,560
I think this is normal.

1003
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:47,580
This seems pretty normal.

1004
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:59,100
the back of the seat looks like a robot face oh it does kind
of look like a robot face yeah i see that okay so i have to

1005
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,120
run back

1006
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,920

1007
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:14,320

01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:20,620

01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:22,900
That's normal?

1010
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:23,240
Okay.

1011
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:26,740
Okay.

1012
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:31,220
Turn back if no anomaly.

1013
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:32,620
So we're turning back.

1014
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:37,700
What kind of sandwich is this?

1015
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,660
Chicken green.

1016
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:43,040
What is chicken and green?

1017
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:48,510
Sea lantern blocks.

1018
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:49,230

Ma'am, we'll let you pass.

You shall pass.

1030
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:42,640
Wait a second.

1031
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:43,920
Sticks!

1032
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,840
You weren't selling sticks before, were you?

1033
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:49,520
Actually, I think she was.

1034
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,180
I can't remember, though.

1035
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,180
I can't remember, actually.

1036
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:55,520
Chicken and green.

1037
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:57,540
I feel like if it's...

1038
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,020
That looks down there, that looks like a tomato...

1039
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:03,420
Tomato.

1040
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:04,520
Tamago.

1041
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,000
An eggy sandwich.

1042
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:14,360
I didn't just say tomato for no reason, it's because I was
thinking tamago.

1043
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,360
But...

1044
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,960
Oh man, that's how my brain works.

1045
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:23,240
For real, you guys.

1046
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,580
My brain can be quite confusing.

1047
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,320
Oh, gosh, lady.

1048
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,000
Your dumpy is making it hard to pass.

1049
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:35,500
Tomato...

1050
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:36,260
Tomago.

1051
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:41,040
Ah!

1052
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:44,680
Oh!

1053
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:54,530
Gosh, I don't like you!

1054
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:57,870
Wait, didn't he say don't trust the people in suits?

1055
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:01,310
But they're not wearing a suit.

1056
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,360
This Shinkansen.

1057
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:10,500
Zero.

1058
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:11,280
Headed.

1059
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,300
To Tokyo.

1060
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,940
He looks like Orochimaru.

1061
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,240
He does actually.

1062
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:19,280
Anime Orochimaru.

1063
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:19,600
Oh wait.

1064
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:21,260
Anime Orochimaru.

1065
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,820
Anime Terminator is what I was thinking.

1066
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:26,600
Wait this one looks too normal too.

1067
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,660
He's come back.

1068
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:31,160
Is that work?

1069
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:46,240
I'm afraid that I'm going to miss something because it's in
the dark area and I don't want to go over there.

1070
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:48,400
I'm afraid of the dark you got.

1071
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:54,520
Did the cushions always look like this or am I going crazy?

1072
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:58,340
Paki.

1073
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,420
Did the cushions on...

1074
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,300
They did?

1075
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:05,700
Okay.

1076
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,740
No and yes.

1077
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,120
Why are you like this?

1078
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,000
Why are you like this?

1079
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,420
Is it normal then?

1080
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:19,800
Are we normal?

1081
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:21,800
Is everything normal?

1082
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,400
Nothing's normal about this.

1083
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:25,300
But is it normal?

1084
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:26,960
Oh, gosh.

1085
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:28,700
Oh.

1086
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:29,920
Oh.

1087
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:33,060
My throat is actually starting to hurt.

1088
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,420
I need to stop screaming.

1089
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,460
Creamy.

1090
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,780
Mr. Mr!

1091
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:47,070
Why is your eye glowing?

1092
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:50,790
Oh!

1093
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:52,030
Oh!

1094
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:54,170
You can...

1095
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:55,130
Thank you!

1096
01:14:56,990 --> 01:15:04,610
I like to think that when the your simp sound plays, it's
you guys calling me a simp, which is quite honestly

1097
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:06,150
accurate, so...

1098
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:10,110
Looks good to me, Kappa.

1099
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:26,440
That, I don't believe that there are two trains in a row
that are normal.

1100
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:29,120
Right?

1101
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,160
Like, that doesn't sound good.

1102
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,640
I'm being serious here?

1103
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:34,920
Go, I know you can make it.

1104
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:35,600
Get out of here.

1105
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,340
Everyone's waiting for you.

1106
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,260
the bright blue desktop wallpaper.

1107
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:50,820
I didn't either.

1108
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,080
On my computer.

1109
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:55,960
I just...

1110
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:57,840
Well, I technically did.

1111
01:15:58,460 --> 01:15:59,180
Well, okay, hold on.

1112
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,920
No, I technically didn't, but I'm using wallpaper engine, so
it's fine.

1113
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,360
I don't see anything in the reflections.

1114
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:10,180
I think we're good.

1115
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,020
I think we're good.

1116
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:12,620
Oh, oh, no.

1117
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:13,820
Please, no mistake.

1118
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:15,480
I'm afraid of the ghost.

1119
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:15,880
I'm afraid of the ghost.

1120
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,900
I'm afraid of the ghost!

1121
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:22,000
There can only be one ghost here, okay?

1122
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,180
Where did grandpa go?

1123
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:28,900
25.

1124
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,440
Oh my gosh.

1125
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:37,820
There actually was nothing.

1126
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,380
Headed to Tokyo.

1127
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:43,340
25.

1128
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:44,300
25.

1129
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:45,100
25.

1130
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:46,200
Back home.

1131
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:49,520
Go off this train.

1132
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:51,560
Need you.

1133
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:52,940
Get out of here.

1134
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:59,340
Is that just the lighting or what is... what is that?

1135
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,380
Is that a... what is that?

1136
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,440
Is that an anomaly?

1137
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:09,740
Is that a person?

1138
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:10,540
What is that?

1139
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:11,700
Invisible man.

1140
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:19,470
I have to go past it!

1141
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:23,210
Invisible Man Anomaly?

1142
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:25,090
Well, he's not doing a very good job.

1143
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:26,530
I noticed him immediately.

1144
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:30,990
Ma 'am, ma'am, ma'am.

1145
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:34,830
What did I just hear?

1146
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:39,950
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, there's a man in my seat.

1147
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:43,130
Please, please, there's a man in my...

1148
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:44,890
Oh my gosh, that scared me.

1149
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:45,990
I thought she responded.

1150
01:17:45,990 --> 01:18:04,710
one time okay so I once um though okay so one time I flew
business class back from Japan it was the only it's the only

1151
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:13,790
time I've ever flown business class on it on a flight and I
only did it on the way back home because doing both ways is

1152
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:22,970
would have been so expensive right whoa fancy I know it was
after a work trip so I was like you know what I am gonna get

1153
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:29,370
the business class because I'm I've been working this whole
time and I'm very tired I just really wanted to like feel

1154
01:18:29,370 --> 01:18:41,950
good on the plane and I sat down in my little cubicle and
also I was just like this probably will be the only chance I

1155
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:47,290
get at business class because usually they're like full like
I just like to even though I'm not going to get it but

1156
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:55,570
usually all the seats are taken but for this flight they
weren't and so I was just like you know slash the price in

1157
01:18:55,570 --> 01:19:05,530
half and my old company had taken care of the initial price
so it almost felt like I was paying for just a regular

1158
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:16,310
ticket to Japan anyway so I was like okay um so I know it's
like sounds like copium but I really had to like do to get

1159
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:35,830
myself to buy this thing um so girl math yeah actually um
the old company being heaven yes yes but anyway so i um i uh

1160
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:43,530
i sat down in my little cubicle and i'm like okay this is so
oh my gosh this is like my first this is a first-time

1161
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:56,590
experience this is so crazy and i lean back in my seat and
to my right is a man's foot the guy behind me like put his

1162
01:19:56,590 --> 01:20:08,030
feet up over the cubicle so that his feet were directly in
my face and i was like this is met i did not spend this

1163
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:20,710
money well like but I did I I I I am in I am in the business
class I do not deserve this disrespect so I I called over a

1164
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:27,830
flight attendant and I was like I know we haven't taken off
yet but can you tell him to like put his feet down also I

1165
01:20:27,830 --> 01:20:35,550
was like the the beds go down like there's so much foot
space down there why don't you just lay down if you want to

1166
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:44,930
extend your feet like that did you tell him off no because
i'm very non-confrontational but i told the i told this the

1167
01:20:44,930 --> 01:20:50,330
flight attendant i was like could you please tell him to
like put his feet down they're in my face and she goes to

1168
01:20:50,330 --> 01:21:06,010
him thank you so much um she goes to him and says the girl
in front of you complained could you please um put your feet

1169
01:21:06,010 --> 01:21:14,370
down and i was like now you're gonna now you put a target on
my back you couldn't just say hi sir we're about to take off

1170
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:25,010
could you please lower your feet like anything like that no
yeah she put me on blast i was so almost like i thought this

1171
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:32,770
is gonna be the worst trip ever i should have never paid for
it anyway this invisible man for some reason reminded me of

1172
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:41,410
okay we just gotta run forward we just gotta run forward we
just gotta run run run he's probably just gonna stay there

1173
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:48,670
he's he's he's in his own lane he's he's living his
invisible life he doesn't even want to be seen he doesn't

1174
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:51,970
even want to be seen so he wouldn't chase after me because
he doesn't want us to notice him

1175
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:11,330
anyways maybe i should have publicly shamed that man been
like feet are stinky and they're in my face okay moisturized

1176
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:21,650
and unbothered I hope he's not moisturized okay here we go
sorry I know I'm like stalling I'm scared I'm scared I'm

1177
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:26,190
scared I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared I'm
scared I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared I'm

1178
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:38,000
scared I'm scared I'm scared Maybe we should have confirmed
that it was an invisible man.

1179
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,980
But that thing has never been there before, so.

1180
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:41,860
Oh!

1181
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:45,420
Oh my god, it's beautiful!

1182
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:46,780
Wait, there's nobody here, though.

1183
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:49,260
Wow!

1184
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:51,580
Kind of like...

1185
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:53,000
Oh, that's my feet.

1186
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:54,780
I was like, I like this one.

1187
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,240
Wait, we have to continue on through this.

1188
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,200
I was going to turn around, but...

1189
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,580
We just gotta...

1190
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:02,820
Wait, is that a person up?

1191
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:04,720
No, that's a...

1192
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:05,480
Wait, that's a tree.

1193
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:11,140
No anomalies, just rad.

1194
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:15,580
Well, at least it was easy to tell.

1195
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:17,840
I'm still kind of scared, though.

1196
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:22,600
What if there's, what if a, what if a, what if a, a lion
pops out at me or something?

1197
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:24,300
I don't know.

1198
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:25,740
Okay, run!

1199
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:27,660
Ah!

1200
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:30,740
Hey, it's a kid!

1201
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,340
Hey, mister.

1202
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,740
Aw, do you think we'll ever get out of here live?

1203
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,140
Uh, think about your sister.

1204
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:50,990
Um, well, I'm gonna keep doing my job.

1205
01:23:51,290 --> 01:23:53,230
Maybe you should consider doing yours, okay?

1206
01:23:57,390 --> 01:23:57,910
Wow.

1207
01:23:58,970 --> 01:24:01,310
That is a trunk.

1208
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:11,100
Anybody in here?

1209
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:20,700
I was wondering if we were gonna see him again i thought he
would be like in the bathroom but it's 25 oh 24 gosh it's a

1215
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,260
Oh, I thought she was about to look at me.

1216
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:16,560
Nothing in the reflections that I can see.

1217
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:18,180
Hello?

1218
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:22,820
I mean, I could see the mountains from here, though.

1219
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:25,420
Nothing.

1220
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:28,020
Nothing here.

1221
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:34,780
Oh!

1222
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:38,540
I can't tell if it's the game or not.

1223
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:44,440
Help.

1224
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:55,940
Mystery, you need some help.

1225
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:59,320
Thank you.

1226
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:01,600
Glad to have you back, boss.

1227
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:07,260
Any chance you'll play Kojima's masterpiece, Death
Stranding, in its full glory on stream.

1228
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:13,280
I would like to, just because I want to get ready for Death
Stranding 2.

1229
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:17,280
I doesn't feel darker than before.

1230
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:19,200
Why?

1231
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:22,560
Why does I feel darker than before, you guys, you guys!

1232
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:31,220
I know it's not, but I think I'm... I don't know!

1233
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:40,400
An anomaly where he's not balding.

1234
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:44,160
An anomaly he has, like, luscious, beautiful hair.

1235
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,080
He's... He looks fine.

1236

Okay, turn back if no anomaly, okay.

Okay.

Good job.

Good job, team.

1254
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:03,510
Good job.

1255
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:05,250
What would I do without you guys?

1256
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,310
Oh.

1257
01:29:08,830 --> 01:29:10,510
Oh, God, please.

1258
01:29:10,610 --> 01:29:11,430
I need a break.

1259
01:29:12,010 --> 01:29:13,450
I just...

1260
01:29:14,830 --> 01:29:16,030
Oh, man.

1261
01:29:16,910 --> 01:29:17,950
Okay, here we go.

1262
01:29:20,050 --> 01:29:20,750
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1263
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:28,880
Car one.

1264
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:34,520
This is Shinkansen Zero.

1265
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,660
Headed to Tokyo.

1266
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:38,080
Okay.

1267
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:42,260
Good work, boss.

1268
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:44,240
No, that was on you guys.

1269
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,260
That was all you.

1270
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:48,460
Oh.

1271
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:50,540
She scared me.

1272
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:52,880
Mm-hmm.

1273
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:57,240
Mm-hmm.

1274
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:02,360
She's still typey town.

1275
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:05,240
Okay.

1276
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,920
No one else in these seats.

1277
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:18,160
What are you working on?

1278
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,080
She's writing fan fiction.

1279
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:23,740
Probably.

1280
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:27,040
I think that's just the game.

1281
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:30,180
I think that's just the game.

1282
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:40,400
Okay.

1283
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:45,740
All right, guys.

1284
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,000
So far so good.

1285
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:55,080
The other one, the other one could have been easy to miss,
though.

1286
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:56,400
You know?

1287
01:30:57,240 --> 01:31:01,040
Had I, had I not gone back, so...

1288
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:06,670
This train is so chill.

1289
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:08,150
You, you think this is chill?

1290
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:10,810
Are you feeling really relaxed right now?

1291
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:12,650
Are you having a good time?

1292
01:31:12,990 --> 01:31:14,190
I'm so happy for you.

1293
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:17,930
You think this is a nice, chill little run here?

1294
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:18,250
Hmm?

1295
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:18,950
Yeah?

1296
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:19,910
Yeah?

1297
01:31:20,630 --> 01:31:21,190
God.

1298
01:31:21,830 --> 01:31:22,290
Oh, God.

1299
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:25,190
Okay, Mr. Oh.

1300
01:31:27,450 --> 01:31:27,810
Oh.

1301
01:31:28,370 --> 01:31:30,590
Wait, I don't see anything for real, though.

1302
01:31:34,510 --> 01:31:35,070
Chilla.

1303
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:35,790
Chilla.

1304
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:41,230
Oh gosh, I feel so stressed.

1305
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:45,770
I feel very intense.

1306
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:51,110
I feel like I need, like, a massage after this or something.

1307
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:53,970
She's so tall, too.

1308
01:31:54,230 --> 01:31:58,610
How, how, how short are we?

1309
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:00,230
It's okay, though.

1310
01:32:00,330 --> 01:32:01,810
I prefer tall women, you know?

1311
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:03,710
It's okay.

1312
01:32:04,710 --> 01:32:05,350
Um.

1313
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:09,410
Ghost massage.

1314
01:32:12,090 --> 01:32:12,850
Put my...

1315
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:17,510
By the time I'm done, I'm going to be like a little ghost
orb because I'm going to be so relaxed.

1316
01:32:17,710 --> 01:32:18,410
I'm going to be...

1317
01:32:18,410 --> 01:32:20,190
They're going to need me into a ball.

1318
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,500
You guys think it's okay?

1319
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:38,440
I didn't see anything.

1320
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:51,470
oh gosh every time it does that that's that's part of the
game that's that's not like a I think it would be more

1321
01:32:51,470 --> 01:33:07,480
obvious if it were like a flickering light you know looks
okay to me turn back if no anomaly I think there's no

1322
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:15,700
anomaly what do you think ma'am Check the old man.

1323
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:26,950
There's no face in his bald spot.

1324
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:29,650
He looks the same as before.

1325
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:34,770
He looks pretty much the same.

1326
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:40,170
He is so tall also.

1327
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:42,150
Gosh, maybe I'm the child.

1328
01:33:44,010 --> 01:33:44,450
Okay.

1329
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:50,630
Don't look at me, don't look at me, don't look at me, don't
look at me.

1330
01:33:55,550 --> 01:33:55,990
Okay.

1331
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:01,660
Here goes nothing.

1332
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:03,820
24.

1333
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:07,380
22.

1334
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:18,080
The numbers.

1335
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:19,960
What do they mean?

1336
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:21,280
What do they mean?

1337
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:24,700
Zero!

1338
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,420
Oh my gosh, nice.

1339
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:29,560
Nice, nice, nice.

1340
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:30,360
Good job, everybody.

1341
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:31,760
Good job, team.

1342
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:32,700
Good job, team.

1343
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:35,080
Okay.

1344
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:37,200
So far.

1345
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:40,180
So far, so good.

1346
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,060
He's always said 22.

1347
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:45,740
What do you mean?

1348
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:46,940
No, I know.

1349
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:48,360
Oh, wait.

1350
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:55,640
He did say 25 before because I said like need you go need
you go off the train.

1351
01:34:56,260 --> 01:35:08,100
Yeah He did say 25 before I'm not crazy I'm not crazy Put me
in a room a room full of rats the rats made me crazy I was

1352
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:19,660
crazy once they put me in a room a room full of sticks the
sticks made me crazy But we did skip 23 yeah Unless I just

1353
01:35:19,660 --> 01:35:20,510
forgot to...

1354
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:24,000
I forgot to...

1355
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:24,700
Oh.

1356
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:26,840
Crazy cute.

1357
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:28,680
Stop it!

1358
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,360
Unless I forgot to check the telephone.

1359
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:34,500
At that point.

1360
01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:48,510
Okay.

1361
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:49,110
Okay.

1362
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:50,030
Okay.

1363
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:50,070
Okay.

1364
01:35:50,090 --> 01:35:50,550
Okay.

1365
01:35:54,230 --> 01:35:55,430
Where's rule seven?

1366
01:35:56,390 --> 01:36:00,950
Rule seven is what you imagine it to be.

1367
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:06,110
Rule seven is, you know, what you make of it.

1368
01:36:12,570 --> 01:36:13,130
Mm-hmm.

1369
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:17,600
Mm-hmm.

1370
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:21,540
Ghost of rule seven.

1371
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:22,040
seven.

1372
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:29,000
So far, nothing in the windows, nothing in the seats.

1373
01:36:31,740 --> 01:36:33,520
in the streets.

1374
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:34,860
Ghost in the sheets.

1375
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:36,180
Ghost in the seats.

1376
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,440
That ghost.

1377
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:41,040
What?

1378
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:44,040
What was that sound?

1379
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,200
I don't know.

1380
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:51,360
You'd think I would get used to it, but I'm not.

1381
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:54,480
I just think, what if at some point they're going to grab
me?

1382
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:58,340
No way.

1383
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,860
There's no anomaly on this one either.

1384
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:03,660
It's not common for people who have watched other people
play this game.

1385
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:05,560
But there's, like, typically...

1386
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:12,780
More anomaly-less trains than anomaly-filled trains.

1387
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,000
No, your luck is ridiculous.

1388
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,540
Well, if it grabs you, it would be an anomaly.

1389
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:23,680
So true!

1390
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:29,100
Kyo-mo kawaii, isn't it?

1391
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:33,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1392
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:36,000
Okay.

1393
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:41,360
This is Shinkansen Zero headed to Tokyo.

1394
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:44,240
Tokyo calling.

1395
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:45,860
Tokyo calling.

1396
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:48,980
Tokyo calling.

1397
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:50,880
Tokyo calling.

1398
01:37:56,090 --> 01:37:56,650
Um...

1399
01:37:56,650 --> 01:37:57,130
Okay.

1400
01:37:59,210 --> 01:38:01,690
If no anomaly turned back...

1401
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:05,450
It would really suck since we're at train zero!

1402
01:38:06,770 --> 01:38:07,330
Right?

1403
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:08,630
Right, lady!

1404
01:38:10,870 --> 01:38:12,770
She's kind of double-jointed, just like me.

1405
01:38:14,450 --> 01:38:16,470
Rule 7 is rule 30... No!

1406
01:38:19,610 --> 01:38:21,230
That's not an anomaly, right?

1407
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:22,850
That's just a...

1408
01:38:22,850 --> 01:38:23,670
I think that's just a...

1409
01:38:23,690 --> 01:38:26,430
how she looks.

1410
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:30,510
Her face is a bit weird.

1411
01:38:31,390 --> 01:38:38,050
You, actually, this is maybe the most normal faces I've ever
seen in Chilla's art game.

1412
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:40,150
Like, ever.

1413
01:38:40,690 --> 01:38:42,010
Ever, ever, ever, ever.

1414
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:48,610
Like, I think this is actually the most normal faces I've
ever seen in a Chilla's art game.

1415
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:55,990
They even have, like, she has, like, a little bit of, you
know, like, bit of definition like i think in the past

1416
01:38:55,990 --> 01:39:07,810
they've just been like pngs pasted on top of a of a of a of
a egg and that was their face yeah true they're improving

1417
01:39:07,810 --> 01:39:15,030
yeah yeah she doesn't look so bad like creepy yes and also
she's got like these weird old pixelated shadows but that's

1418
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:24,930
fine that's fine what's her skincare routine for real okay i
think i think I think...

1419
01:39:24,930 --> 01:39:26,370
Alright guys, what's the consensus?

1420
01:39:26,730 --> 01:39:27,270
Do we...

1421
01:39:27,270 --> 01:39:29,310
Do we say there's no anomaly?

1422
01:39:29,650 --> 01:39:31,670
I don't see anything.

1423
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:35,070
We went through every seat?

1424
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:37,950
I truly didn't see anything.

1425
01:39:39,790 --> 01:39:40,650
I think it's good.

1426
01:39:41,890 --> 01:39:42,570
All clear?

1427
01:39:43,270 --> 01:39:44,310
I'd say there's none.

1428
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:47,290
Okay.

1429
01:39:56,620 --> 01:39:58,000
Still nothing in there.

1430
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:00,160
Alrighty.

1431
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:09,640
Conductors room!

1432
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:12,880
Nice.

1433
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:15,340
Good job, everybody.

1434
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:18,360
Wait, so...

1435
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:19,460
How does this one work?

1436
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:24,340
I still go back if there's an anomaly or...

1437
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:31,180
Or do I just go forward?

1438
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:34,330
She scared me again.

1439
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:39,150
Just go forward now.

1440
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:40,830
Oh, so there is no anomaly.

1441
01:40:41,930 --> 01:40:42,790
Just go to the end?

1442
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:44,190
Just go forward?

1443
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:49,660
Oh, madam.

1444
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:52,680
I love to see you walk away.

1445
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,900
Headed to Tokyo.

1446
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:58,560
So there's no anomalies here?

1447
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:00,160
I could just go?

1448
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:04,000
Even with her?

1449
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:06,320
With him?

1450
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:07,600
With him?

1451
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,420
Ghost on bottom left.

1452
01:41:15,660 --> 01:41:20,920
I think I'm going to run for it.

1453
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:48,940
Conductor's room.

1454
01:41:54,460 --> 01:41:56,200
I can't tell if I should believe you guys.

1455
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,120
I'm just going to do a quick sweep.

1456
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:01,820
A quick check.

1457
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:03,720
Just in case.

1458
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:05,760
Just in case.

1459
01:42:07,220 --> 01:42:08,680
Just in case.

1460
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:12,420
Just go forward.

1461
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:13,300
Okay, fine.

1462
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:14,260
Fine, fine.

1463
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:19,440
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

1464
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:28,860
Doesn't work.

1465
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:30,660
Wait, what's over here?

1466
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:34,450
It's...

1467
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:36,220
It's a PNG.

1468
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:39,420
I'm putting a break.

1469
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,780
I'm putting a stop to this crazy train.

1470
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:43,620
Brrr!

1471
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:46,840
Hmm?

1472
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:49,580
Uh-oh.

1473
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:13,640
Why am I so small?

1474
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:23,500
Wait, we can go out, or we can go through here?

1475
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:24,700
Oh, oh!

1476
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:35,220
Ending one!

1477
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:36,420
Get off the train!

1478
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:37,340
This

1479
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:45,040
song is safe to use on YouTube.

1480
01:43:48,220 --> 01:43:48,700
That...

1481
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:51,460
That...

1482
01:43:51,460 --> 01:43:52,440
What song?

1483
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:54,100
What

1484
01:43:58,250 --> 01:44:00,850
song?

1485
01:44:01,830 --> 01:44:04,810
Wait, so what's the other ending?

1486
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:06,310
Wait, what even happened?

1487
01:44:07,290 --> 01:44:08,450
Nothing even happened.

1488
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:09,230
Huh?

1489
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:22,470

just didn't see them do I just keep going?

1505
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:29,870
How far do I need to go for?

1506
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:33,570
Schrödinger's bathroom.

1507
01:47:35,870 --> 01:47:36,230
Okay.

1508
01:47:37,890 --> 01:47:38,690
Just go?

1509
01:47:38,830 --> 01:47:39,230
Okay.

1510
01:47:40,050 --> 01:47:41,050
I'm going.

1511
01:47:43,610 --> 01:47:44,470
Is there anything in here?

1512
01:47:45,790 --> 01:47:46,410
Aji-chang.

1513
01:47:47,230 --> 01:47:48,330
Kid in the bathroom.

1514
01:47:49,990 --> 01:47:51,290
No one in the bathroom.

1515
01:47:51,810 --> 01:47:54,270
I don't even know why I'm going back through here.

1516
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:55,930
All the way back?

1517
01:47:57,570 --> 01:47:58,130
Oh.

1518
01:47:59,550 --> 01:48:00,790
Was that suitcase there before?

1519
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:04,370
Okay, I'm just gonna run for it.

1520
01:48:04,570 --> 01:48:04,750
Ah!

1521
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:05,750
Wow!

1522
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:13,920
Wow!

1523
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:14,900
Oh!

1524
01:48:23,980 --> 01:48:24,340
Choo!

1525
01:48:25,180 --> 01:48:25,900
Thank you!

1526
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:30,540
You have to walk all the way back to your seat if you want
to see the supporter stuff.

1527
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:32,480
I think you either choose supporter stuff.

1528
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:33,140
Yeah, yeah.

1529
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:36,340
But is that the only reason you guys are having me walk all
the way back?

1530
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,780
Or is it actually the way to get the other ending because...

1531
01:48:58,810 --> 01:49:00,750
I'm gonna check the bathroom every time.

1532
01:49:02,930 --> 01:49:03,770
Still not there.

1533
01:49:03,970 --> 01:49:06,510
I should probably, like, check in these corners, too.

1534
01:49:07,570 --> 01:49:08,250
Just in case.

1535
01:49:10,790 --> 01:49:11,510
Other ending.

1536
01:49:12,130 --> 01:49:12,710
On four.

1537
01:49:13,930 --> 01:49:15,390
There were seven, right?

1538
01:49:16,010 --> 01:49:19,650
I really have to go all the way back!

1539
01:49:28,730 --> 01:49:29,170
Yeah?

1540
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:30,370
Yeah?

1541
01:49:36,030 --> 01:49:37,990
Hold on, give me one second.

1542
01:49:38,270 --> 01:49:38,790
I'm going to do something.

1543
01:49:38,810 --> 01:49:39,750
Let me run real quick.

1544
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:42,470
Na, na, na, na, na.

1545
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:44,210
Okay.

1546
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:49,190
Um.

1547
01:49:55,670 --> 01:49:56,030
Meow.

1548
01:49:56,790 --> 01:49:57,250
Meow.

1549
01:49:59,610 --> 01:50:01,370
Do I have to check the bathroom every time?

1550
01:50:01,790 --> 01:50:09,550
Or, or can I, uh, or can I, um, ignore it?

1551
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:10,490
Yes?

1552
01:50:12,010 --> 01:50:12,610
Yes.

1553
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:13,390
So many people.

1554
01:50:13,810 --> 01:50:14,790
Some people say yes.

1555
01:50:14,810 --> 01:50:16,010
Yes, some people say no.

1556
01:50:17,830 --> 01:50:20,890
Why are you checking it even in case the kid is in there,
right?

1557
01:50:23,710 --> 01:50:25,570
Always check the bathroom.

1558
01:50:37,110 --> 01:50:38,290
Oh, she's awake.

1559
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:41,700
Hello?

1560
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:44,600
Oh, she's like, where's my brother?

1561
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:45,580
Oh, loading.

1562
01:50:48,860 --> 01:50:49,400
Okay.

1563
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:56,100
She sounds so cute.

1564
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:58,800
So the train wasn't stopping and it was looping?

1565
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:07,820
Actually, I also just noticed that their mouths move now
too.

1566
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:15,480
Before, like, in old Chilla's art games, they would just,
since it was just the PNG face, like, their mouths wouldn't

1567
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:17,160
really talk, right?

1568
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:20,680
And he managed to hit the brakes and stop everything?

1569
01:51:23,580 --> 01:51:24,820
Oh, that's what she just said.

1570
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:29,680
It turned off again.

1571
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:31,520
Everything about this is so hard to believe.

1572
01:51:32,020 --> 01:51:34,500
Oh my gosh, she's so cute.

1573
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:38,260
I guess I have no choice but to believe you.

1574
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:39,300
That is not what she said.

1575
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:46,220
Something doesn't feel right.

1576
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:51,800
I don't remember boarding this train.

1577
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:54,800
Boy in a black hood.

1578
01:51:54,820 --> 01:51:56,420
Oh, I saw your brother?

1579
01:51:57,380 --> 01:51:58,260
Oh, Naoki!

1580
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:00,020
Oh, Naoki!

1581
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:06,820
I was with my brother before I lost my memory.

1582
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:15,960
God, she's so cute.

1583
01:52:16,100 --> 01:52:17,700
Did he say anything about why we're here?

1584
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,000
Um...

1585
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,020
No, you didn't see him?

1586
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:28,840
You weren't with him?

1587
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:33,620
Did you see him on the way here?

1588
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:37,760
Uh, oh, not after I stopped the train.

1589
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:44,540
So you came from the green car side.

1590
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:48,780
Then he must be on the other side.

1591
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:50,460
All right.

1592
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:52,120
Let's find him.

1593
01:52:53,020 --> 01:52:54,440
him and get out.

1594
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:58,280
but, oh, wait a Okay.

1595
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:01,200
Why isn't that part subtitled?

1596
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:09,500
If you think about that, then, then, there's another person
coming out of the What do you mean by that?

1597
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:10,280
Come to think of it.

1598
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:14,320
Oh, I guess that's true, yeah.

1599
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:16,740
What about the people who might end up here in the future?

1600
01:53:17,220 --> 01:53:20,300
What about the people who might dot, dot, dot.

1601
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:22,300
Just wait a little bit.

1602
01:53:23,020 --> 01:53:24,920
Did you guys need subtitles for that one, actually?

1603
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:28,320
Shouldn't we think of a way to end this nightmare for good?

1604
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:31,220
Let's burn it down!

1605
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:33,140
Let's burn the train!

1606
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:37,160
A looping place.

1607
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:41,240
I saw this in an anime.

1608
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:43,440
Come on, girl.

1609
01:53:44,060 --> 01:53:45,340
You know what you want to say.

1610
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,660
You know what you want to say.

1611
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:51,200
It's just like one of my Japanese anime.

1612
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:55,140
Oh, I remember.

1613
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:58,320
In the show.

1614
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:02,440
What?

1615
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:10,780
They broke the loop by having two people run to the opposite
direction really fast.

1616
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:14,780
Jujutsu Kaisen reference?

1617
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:15,400
Oh, actually?

1618
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:19,100
I only watched season one of Jujutsu Kaisen.

1619
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:22,380
How about that?

1620
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:24,460
Wait.

1621
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:29,760
But the train isn't looping anymore.

1622
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:36,640
Right, the train stops looping after hitting the brakes.

1623
01:54:37,660 --> 01:54:39,880
Oh, I know.

1624
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:45,200
What if we start the train at the same time?

1625
01:54:46,300 --> 01:54:48,540
Why are we starting the train again?

1626
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:51,300
On both ends.

1627
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:58,520
You can go back to the green car side.

1628
01:55:00,700 --> 01:55:03,080
I'll go to the normal car side.

1629
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:04,900
Why is there a...

1630
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:05,740
Wait, I'm confused.

1631
01:55:06,020 --> 01:55:11,480
Why would there be a way to start the train on this side?

1632
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:11,920
Huh?

1633
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:14,100
Oh, so I...

1634
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:19,000
And also, we're closer to the normal car side, so you're
having me run all the way back?

1635
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:22,180
No, I'll go to the normal side.

1636
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:22,500
Wait.

1637
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:25,700
Wait, does this affect the ending?

1638
01:55:26,140 --> 01:55:26,340
Uh-oh.

1639
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:28,720
Uh-oh.

1640
01:55:31,780 --> 01:55:33,260
Go to the normal side?

1641
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:39,160
Normal or you get the same ending?

1642
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:40,120
Oh, okay, okay.

1643
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:40,660
Thank you guys.

1644
01:55:40,860 --> 01:55:41,000
Thank you.

1645
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:42,940
Go to the normal side or you get the same.

1646
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:43,180
Okay.

1647
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:44,060
Thank you guys.

1648
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:44,600
Thank you.

1649
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:49,680
Oh, I just saw the other ending is back to your seat and
choose to go to white car.

1650
01:55:49,820 --> 01:55:53,200
The supporter stuff is unrelated at the very start of the
game as an anomaly.

1651
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:55,140
Ah, got it, got it, got it.

1652
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:56,680
Understandable.

1653
01:55:56,900 --> 01:55:57,560
Thank you.

1654
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:02,540
Okay, so I'll go to the normal side.

1655
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:05,680
Are you sure?

1656
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:12,500
My brother is on the other side.

1657
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,520
Can I trust you with my brother?

1658
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:23,600
Yeah, I'm competent.

1659
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:25,980
Well, you did manage to stop the train.

1660
01:56:26,380 --> 01:56:28,140
All right then.

1661
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:34,420
I trust you, Mr. Huff-fuff-fuff.

1662
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:37,580
Yeah, all right then.

1663
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:39,060
Let's hurry.

1664
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:43,860
Who knows when the train will start again?

1665
01:56:45,580 --> 01:56:45,760
Okay.

1666
01:56:52,470 --> 01:56:55,790
Uh, uh, uh, uh, That's your, that's what you said.

1667
01:56:56,330 --> 01:56:57,030
Come on.

1668
01:56:57,650 --> 01:56:59,310
Get running, girl.

1669
01:57:01,450 --> 01:57:01,830
Get running.

1670
01:57:06,540 --> 01:57:07,340
Where's the kid?

1671
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:09,560
Oh, what just happened?

1672
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:12,080
Hello?

1673
01:57:14,740 --> 01:57:17,040
Oh, it's not even, I don't think it's letting me.

1674
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:18,080
I'm scared.

1675
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:21,840
What's gonna happen?

1676
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:22,540
I'm scared.

1677
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:26,100
Is someone gonna chase me?

1678
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:43,020
I swear if you come trying to chase me I'm gonna I'm gonna
do something you're not gonna like it run oh okay I'm

whoa it's beautiful wait we're in the actual normal world we
made it back?

1690
01:59:25,140 --> 01:59:25,300
Maybe?

1691
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:27,240
Oh my gosh.

1692
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:28,220
Oh, oh.

1693
01:59:29,140 --> 01:59:30,940
Maybe we're not in the normal world.

1694
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:32,320
Actually, I'm not so sure.

1695
01:59:34,580 --> 01:59:35,180
Hmm.

1696
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:37,940
I love my void trees.

1697
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:38,820
You know?

1698
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:41,700
Oh, wait.

1699
01:59:41,940 --> 01:59:42,380
Wait.

1700
01:59:42,700 --> 01:59:43,680
Where's the door here?

1701
01:59:44,660 --> 01:59:46,700
Oh, I can't go out.

1702
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:47,320
Okay.

1703
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:47,840
Oh.

1704
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:48,440
Oh!

1705
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:49,800
Oh!

1706
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:50,960
Oh my god, we made it!

1707
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:53,660
Oh.

1708
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:55,900
Oh...

1709
02:00:00,140 --> 02:00:01,980
Oh...

1710
02:00:01,980 --> 02:00:04,180
Oh, sorry.

1711
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:10,120
Oh, Nihisan, you're...

1712
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:12,020
You're okay.

1713
02:00:12,020 --> 02:00:13,960
Freaky ghost train.

1714
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:14,200
Oh, Nihisa.

1715
02:00:15,900 --> 02:00:17,860
You're okay.

1716
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:19,860
Naoki!

1717
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:23,160
Good day, you're okay.

1718
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:28,520
O 'Nisan, I'm fine now, mister.

1719
02:00:28,980 --> 02:00:32,760
You want to come with us?

1720
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:34,160
Oh.

1721
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:35,720
I only have...

1722
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:36,620
No, not yet.

1723
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:39,080
You're right.

1724
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:44,080
It's not your time yet?

1725
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:48,600
Am I dead for real?

1726
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:49,400
What?

1727
02:00:54,700 --> 02:00:57,280
I think I know what happened to us.

1728
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:02,280
Wait, so, but they're gonna come back to life, right?

1729
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:07,040
It's okay, Mr. Or they are dead, are they're the dead ones?

1730
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,120
I think actually they're the dead ones.

1731
02:01:12,340 --> 02:01:16,840
More importantly, We have to get home.

1732
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:22,560
Thank you, Mr. Sayonara.

1733
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:23,560
And goodbye.

1734
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:26,480
Oh my god.

1735
02:01:26,740 --> 02:01:29,140
Oh, thanks kid.

1736
02:01:29,700 --> 02:01:32,020
Don't go breaking your arm for me.

1737
02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:35,860
No, I think they're the dead ones.

1738
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,960
I can feel it as a ghost, you know.

1739
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:39,480
I get that sense from them.

1740
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:39,840
Oh!

1741
02:01:44,620 --> 02:01:45,820
I fell?

1742
02:01:48,420 --> 02:01:49,020
Wait!

1743
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:50,320
Wait!

1744
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:51,400
Oh!

1745
02:01:52,100 --> 02:01:54,440
Remember when the...

1746
02:01:54,580 --> 02:02:03,120
remember when the um thank you for the ray thank you so much
remember when we uh had the the train stopped because of the

1747
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:22,060
personal injury you were collapsed on the floor luckily
there was a doctor on board that does not sound real it

1748
02:02:22,060 --> 02:02:27,020
seems you were suffering a light form of deep vein
thrombosis.

1749
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:27,600
What?

1750
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:36,160
That's a voice.

1751
02:02:37,260 --> 02:02:40,880
Or what the Lemons call it, economy class syndrome.

1752
02:02:41,980 --> 02:02:48,160
You guys, I called it from the very beginning that this was
a game about the rich.

1753
02:02:51,640 --> 02:02:54,560
They actually did stuff our body up in there.

1754
02:02:58,220 --> 02:03:00,040
I can't believe it.

1755
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:01,300
I can't believe it.

1756
02:03:01,400 --> 02:03:02,560
I was right this whole time.

1757
02:03:10,580 --> 02:03:14,900
For some reason, I thought we were in the bathroom when I
was like, please do not lay me on the ground in the

1758
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:15,300
bathroom.

1759
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:18,760
Also, are they like on little stools?

1760
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:23,820
I thought they were crouched at first, but it looks like
they have little tiny benches.

1761
02:03:24,580 --> 02:03:26,980
Laying down and raising the legs seemed to have helped.

1762
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:30,600
You should be thankful he was here.

1763
02:03:33,660 --> 02:03:34,760
You should be thankful he was here.

1764
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:44,300
It would have taken much longer to get help.

1765
02:03:48,660 --> 02:03:51,680
Because the train had also stopped while you were out.

1766
02:03:55,720 --> 02:03:59,580
Oh, it, the, she said the personal injury.

1767
02:03:59,820 --> 02:04:00,820
Stop because of the personal injury.

1768
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:04,280
What is she, your mom?

1769
02:04:10,180 --> 02:04:11,720
Oh, that was the injury.

1770
02:04:12,220 --> 02:04:12,620
Okay, wait.

1771
02:04:14,240 --> 02:04:15,280
Are we the injury?

1772
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:17,360
Oh, no.

1773
02:04:17,480 --> 02:04:20,740
A young woman and a boy were confirmed to be involved in the
accident.

1774
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:21,780
Over.

1775
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:23,500
Oh.

1776
02:04:25,420 --> 02:04:27,260
I knew they were dead.

1777
02:04:30,260 --> 02:04:32,440
And I was almost dead too.

1778
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:36,840
Because I had to sit in an economy.

1779
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:40,700
Ending to sad reality.

1780
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:47,820
That's why you got hit.

1781
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:51,680
Don't go walking in the middle of the train tracks.

1782
02:04:59,180 --> 02:05:02,080
Oh, here's our song.

1783
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:11,540
Ah, economy seats were too uncomfortable.

1784
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:13,300
Look at that guy.

1785
02:05:13,420 --> 02:05:14,400
We saw him, right?

1786
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:18,320
We saw him in the first class.

1787
02:05:19,020 --> 02:05:23,080
So he literally was making fun of us.

1788
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:30,980
It's always interesting seeing what VTubers are in the
credits.

1789
02:05:31,540 --> 02:05:34,360
Maybe one day I will be in the credits.

1790
02:05:35,260 --> 02:05:37,120
I know it's, I know I would have to do it myself.

1791
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:40,720
Like I know I have to go to the Patreon, subscribe to the
Patreon.

1792
02:05:40,940 --> 02:05:42,080
But maybe I'll do it one day.

1793
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:47,020
I think every time I play one of these games, I say I'll do
it.

1794
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:47,920
And then I forget.

1795
02:05:49,740 --> 02:05:51,900
And then I forget completely.

1796
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,600
Champs Company Y is on.

1797
02:05:57,080 --> 02:05:57,720
One day.

1798
02:05:57,880 --> 02:05:59,640
Yeah, one day I will be a supporter too.

1799
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:06,840
I say, like, one day, as if, like, it is this great honor,
even though it's just something I need to do myself.

1800
02:06:09,700 --> 02:06:11,300
Okay, next game, guys.

1801
02:06:11,700 --> 02:06:12,780
Next Chilla's Art Game.

1802
02:06:13,340 --> 02:06:15,080
I'm gonna put my name in the game.

1803
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:16,300
Okay?

1804
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:18,620
I think I belong there because I'm a ghost.

1805
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:22,620
Yeah, you just pay up.

1806
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:23,240
Exactly.

1807
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:26,320
I just have to remember to do it.

1808
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:30,640
I just have to remember to do it.

1809
02:06:32,380 --> 02:06:39,960
though I am thank you deep vein thrombosis means having a
blood clot in your leg veins most often which can happen due

1810
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:48,700
to sitting too much if not treated it can be fatal or cause
loss of limbs oh my gosh wait actually the song is so fine I

1811
02:06:48,700 --> 02:06:59,220
like it I saw that there's a way to put yourself like as a
character in the game can you imagine if I was one of the

1812
02:06:59,220 --> 02:07:02,920
ghosts Wouldn't that be so fun?

1813
02:07:04,280 --> 02:07:07,060
Wouldn't it be so fun if I was chasing after you?

1814
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:12,560
I'm gonna ask her to be like, hey.

1815
02:07:13,140 --> 02:07:13,820
Oh, it is?

1816
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:15,160
It was an actual movie.

1817
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:19,560
A sponsor.

1818
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:20,960
Hey.

1819
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:24,220
You were a Rochimaru.

1820
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:26,480
I'm just chilling.

1821
02:07:26,780 --> 02:07:27,620
I'm chillas.

1822
02:07:28,120 --> 02:07:29,180
I'm chilling in the seat.

1823
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:31,140
That one...

1824
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:47,860
I think um I think actually what happened in this is what
kind of um gets me about these find the find the anomaly

1825
02:07:47,860 --> 02:07:57,740
type of game you know what I mean so I love these types of
games but because they're randomized you can get a lot or

1826
02:07:57,740 --> 02:08:10,200
you can get a little And so, um, so, yeah, I don't know.

1827
02:08:10,640 --> 02:08:15,480
I, I, uh, um, I still liked it.

1828
02:08:16,240 --> 02:08:23,800
Just felt like maybe we didn't get some of the more
interesting, some of the more interesting anomalies, maybe.

1829
02:08:24,300 --> 02:08:24,960
Like, gotcha.

1830
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:26,460
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

1831
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:31,140
But we got pretty lucky in that we could finish it, like,
without much error.

1832
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:38,660
you can continue and find the anomalies that's true that's
true that's true continue supporter you guys really want me

Oh my gosh, so cute.

1845
02:09:55,030 --> 02:09:58,230
You guys, I found out something that made me so sad.

1846
02:09:58,970 --> 02:10:01,410
Okay, so I love eating inari sushi.

1847
02:10:03,050 --> 02:10:05,690
And I was like, I was like, this is healthy, right?

1848
02:10:05,750 --> 02:10:06,330
It's tofu.

1849
02:10:06,570 --> 02:10:07,810
I mean, I know it's fried tofu.

1850
02:10:07,830 --> 02:10:15,290
but like it's tofu and I googled it and they were like inari
zushi is really not good for you because of the oils and

1851
02:10:15,290 --> 02:10:26,370
this and that and this and that and I was like but it's like
it's so delicious healthy it's so oily I never I never

1852
02:10:26,370 --> 02:10:33,720
thought of it okay I never thought of it like oh well Oh,

1853
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:35,920
Oh, never mind.

Like, Helsing the anime?

1856
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:47,720
I like the train.

1857
02:10:49,380 --> 02:10:50,940
Hey, Chilla's Art, put me on the train.

1858
02:10:51,380 --> 02:10:52,880
The Edo train.

1859
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:55,960
I can't even read this one.

1860
02:10:56,880 --> 02:10:57,680
It's so small.

1861
02:11:00,700 --> 02:11:01,060
Ugh.

1862
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:05,580
Get off today!

1863
02:11:05,720 --> 02:11:07,100
Oh my gosh, Winter Cedar!

1864
02:11:07,300 --> 02:11:07,720
No!

1865
02:11:09,880 --> 02:11:11,980
I want to donate while I can.

1866
02:11:12,140 --> 02:11:12,780
Oh no!

1867
02:11:13,580 --> 02:11:14,720
Oh my gosh, no!

1868
02:11:17,560 --> 02:11:19,060
Is there something on the suitcase?

1869
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:20,240
Oh gosh!

1870
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:21,620
She scared me too.

1871
02:11:24,340 --> 02:11:25,920
Oh, there is...

1872
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:28,300
Oh my god, there's little chinchillas under the sea!

1873
02:11:28,540 --> 02:11:29,380
That's so cute.

1874
02:11:30,900 --> 02:11:32,200
I wish I could crouch.

1875
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:34,980
Scary.

1876
02:11:35,460 --> 02:11:35,560
Oh.

1877
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:37,120
Ah!

1878
02:11:42,130 --> 02:11:43,450
Inoyama Tamaki!

1879
02:11:46,090 --> 02:11:46,730
Cute.

1880
02:11:48,010 --> 02:11:52,010
I think Tamaki-san has been in like every game ever.

1881
02:11:52,270 --> 02:11:54,650
Or every like Chilla's art game that I've seen.

1882
02:11:56,730 --> 02:11:59,230
I think he's been in every single one.

1883
02:12:00,110 --> 02:12:02,110
For as long as I can remember.

1884
02:12:05,850 --> 02:12:06,490
Uh...

1885
02:12:13,490 --> 02:12:14,770
Mlaka movies.

1886
02:12:15,950 --> 02:12:16,710
making me hungry.

1887
02:12:18,230 --> 02:12:18,930
Hot coffee.

1888
02:12:20,710 --> 02:12:21,710
This is making me hungry.

1889
02:12:24,170 --> 02:12:25,210
Oh cute!

1890
02:12:28,590 --> 02:12:30,210
Ronald McDonald.

1891
02:12:33,510 --> 02:12:35,150
Ronald McDonald!

1892
02:12:35,750 --> 02:12:36,630
Tote mo oishi!

1893
02:12:39,770 --> 02:12:41,050
Oh, it's Iris!

1894
02:12:42,630 --> 02:12:45,290
Wait, wasn't Ollie in another game?

1895
02:12:45,950 --> 02:12:46,990
Wait, this one's so funny.

1896
02:12:47,790 --> 02:12:49,510
The way she's, like, squished against the cam.

1897
02:12:50,890 --> 02:12:52,090
Iris cider.

1898
02:12:53,150 --> 02:12:55,390
Oh, it's a song.

1899
02:12:57,710 --> 02:12:58,310
Kiyo.

1900
02:12:59,530 --> 02:13:00,770
Naboo, Naboo Bento.

1901
02:13:02,450 --> 02:13:02,890
Iris.

1902
02:13:03,570 --> 02:13:04,270
It's Iris.

1903
02:13:06,070 --> 02:13:07,370
I can't grab it.

1904
02:13:08,310 --> 02:13:08,650
Oh.

1905
02:13:08,830 --> 02:13:09,430
Oh.

1906
02:13:09,770 --> 02:13:10,370
Oh.

1907
02:13:12,310 --> 02:13:13,370
Oh my gosh.

1908
02:13:14,350 --> 02:13:14,970
No wonder.

1909
02:13:15,410 --> 02:13:15,730
I couldn't.

1910
02:13:15,830 --> 02:13:15,930
It's.

1911
02:13:15,950 --> 02:13:17,050
It's just like a couple.

1912
02:13:17,390 --> 02:13:18,330
They're just bragging.

1913
02:13:19,850 --> 02:13:22,290
All that effort just to see a damn couple.

1914
02:13:24,930 --> 02:13:25,790
Good for you.

1915
02:13:29,570 --> 02:13:30,970
You've missed a few at the start.

1916
02:13:31,090 --> 02:13:33,010
I know I'm going to go back.

1917
02:13:34,490 --> 02:13:37,010
I mean, that's what...

1918
02:13:37,010 --> 02:13:38,670
That's, uh...

1919
02:13:38,670 --> 02:13:39,850
That's, uh...

1920
02:13:39,850 --> 02:13:43,150
That's, I want that exact same type of energy.

1921
02:13:44,330 --> 02:13:45,630
If I am in the game.

1922
02:13:46,150 --> 02:13:49,170
That's what, that's the kind of picture I'm gonna send in.

1923
02:13:50,430 --> 02:13:52,450
Yeah, I'll go back and look at some of the other ones.

1924
02:13:53,330 --> 02:13:54,630
Are these Korean VTubers?

1925
02:13:55,370 --> 02:13:57,010
A cute vanilla strawberry.

1926
02:13:58,730 --> 02:13:59,210
Cute.

1927
02:14:00,370 --> 02:14:02,150
This is making me hungry, you guys.

1928
02:14:02,310 --> 02:14:03,310
All I had was cereal.

1929
02:14:04,370 --> 02:14:05,150
Oh, cute.

1930
02:14:08,110 --> 02:14:10,050
Mmm, peach tea.

1931
02:14:11,450 --> 02:14:14,570
Lots of bet- lots of people just leaving their garbage
everywhere.

1932
02:14:18,710 --> 02:14:20,110
Rainbow ice.

1933
02:14:21,610 --> 02:14:22,090
Cute.

1934
02:14:30,430 --> 02:14:31,470
Umay drink.

1935
02:14:32,770 --> 02:14:33,670
Where did I...

1936
02:14:33,670 --> 02:14:34,230
I don't even...

1937
02:14:34,230 --> 02:14:34,410
Oh.

1938
02:14:35,210 --> 02:14:36,570
What is going on here?

1939
02:14:36,690 --> 02:14:36,950
Oh!

1940
02:14:37,610 --> 02:14:37,830
Oh!

1941
02:14:38,830 --> 02:14:39,290
Oh!

1942
02:14:39,630 --> 02:14:39,850
Oh!

1943
02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:40,590
Ah!

1944
02:14:44,630 --> 02:14:45,370
Um.

1945
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:53,740
Where did I...

1946
02:14:53,740 --> 02:14:54,560
Where did I start?

1947
02:14:54,620 --> 02:14:55,280
I don't remember.

1948
02:14:56,840 --> 02:14:58,620
Oh my god, cute!

1949
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:00,620
Neco.

1950
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:12,920
I think we saw something very cursed.

1951
02:15:13,060 --> 02:15:14,600
I think we saw something that we shouldn't have.

1952
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:16,620
Oh, that was the anomaly.

1953
02:15:18,320 --> 02:15:19,860
Oh, we saw these ones.

1954
02:15:20,720 --> 02:15:21,420
We saw...

1955
02:15:21,420 --> 02:15:21,980
Did we see these?

1956
02:15:22,140 --> 02:15:22,680
Yeah, yeah.

1957
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:23,400
We saw these.

1958
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:25,180
Did I see this one?

1959
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:27,060
No, cute.

1960
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:37,460
If you guys like guillotan, have you ever had guillotan
before?

1961
02:15:41,890 --> 02:15:42,350
Cow tongue.

1962
02:15:43,950 --> 02:15:46,450
I'm not such a huge fan.

1963
02:15:48,190 --> 02:15:49,730
Are there more cars?

1964
02:15:50,350 --> 02:15:51,110
I don't think so.

1965
02:15:53,070 --> 02:15:54,030
Actually, I say that.

1966
02:15:54,150 --> 02:15:54,650
I have no idea.

1967
02:15:55,410 --> 02:15:55,890
Oh, nope.

1968
02:15:58,190 --> 02:15:58,790
Oh, where did I go?

1969
02:15:58,810 --> 02:16:10,170
I leave off I heard it's good I don't like um really chewy
meat and if you don't like chewy meat you might not like it

1970
02:16:10,170 --> 02:16:23,870
either like it the taste is good but like it's super like so
that's why I don't like it Sam yeah oh wow

1971
02:16:28,810 --> 02:16:30,750
Work it, girl!

1972
02:16:31,650 --> 02:16:33,910
Get your face on the bento.

1973
02:16:34,170 --> 02:16:35,270
Hell yeah!

1974
02:16:38,390 --> 02:16:40,150
What's so funny?

1975
02:16:40,670 --> 02:16:41,490
Latte rich.

1976
02:16:41,990 --> 02:16:42,750
Oh, cute!

1977
02:16:44,350 --> 02:16:45,030
Cute.

1978
02:16:47,310 --> 02:16:49,870
Do people typically go through these?

1979
02:16:57,310 --> 02:16:59,510
Is this it?

1980
02:17:00,570 --> 02:17:03,510
Is this why you guys wanted me to go through the entire
train?

1981
02:17:03,610 --> 02:17:06,290
Is this why you berated me to look through the supporters?

1982
02:17:12,110 --> 02:17:13,930
Oh my gosh.

1983
02:17:14,090 --> 02:17:15,590
That's really clever actually.

1984
02:17:18,310 --> 02:17:22,570
The fact that she's in the salad.

1985
02:17:29,170 --> 02:17:30,490
Oh my god.

1986
02:17:31,530 --> 02:17:32,370
Oh cute.

1987
02:17:36,950 --> 02:17:38,430
There's Ollie somewhere too?

1988
02:17:38,710 --> 02:17:39,450
Okay, we'll find her.

1989
02:17:44,720 --> 02:17:45,260
Old man.

1990
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:47,960
Frog man.

1991
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:49,640
Quero, quero, bento.

1992
02:17:54,420 --> 02:17:56,300
VTuber energy drink.

1993
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:00,820
Would you guys drink a VTuber energy drink?

1994
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:02,440
I mean, we have VTuber potato chips.

1995
02:18:02,660 --> 02:18:03,340
I'm surprised there's not...

1996
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:04,200
Oh, wait, we missed one.

1997
02:18:05,140 --> 02:18:07,000
Surprised there's not VTuber energy drink.

1998
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:09,260
a frog man.

1999
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:10,480
Couldn't be me.

2000
02:18:17,330 --> 02:18:18,210
Shio Daiichi.

2001
02:18:20,850 --> 02:18:20,930
Mmm.

2002
02:18:21,330 --> 02:18:22,390
Sweet coffee.

2003
02:18:25,910 --> 02:18:26,350
Sweet.

2004
02:18:29,290 --> 02:18:31,110
I don't know why I couldn't pick up the other.

2005
02:18:31,330 --> 02:18:32,170
Oh, this one's cute.

2006
02:18:33,830 --> 02:18:34,850
This one's really cute.

2007
02:18:36,250 --> 02:18:38,510
Couldn't pick up the other, that blue train, though,
earlier.

2008
02:18:40,150 --> 02:18:40,590
Cute.

2009
02:18:41,330 --> 02:18:43,950

It's cute.

2014
02:18:58,450 --> 02:18:58,950
It's so cute.

2015
02:19:00,190 --> 02:19:01,410
There's so many.

2016
02:19:01,650 --> 02:19:02,250
Oh my gosh.

2017
02:19:02,850 --> 02:19:04,830
No one's gonna find me if they...

2018
02:19:04,830 --> 02:19:06,110
If you have to go through all of these.

2019
02:19:07,230 --> 02:19:07,790
Mortis.

2020
02:19:09,730 --> 02:19:12,130
If I were to get one, no one would find me.

2021
02:19:12,210 --> 02:19:13,490
I think, right?

2022
02:19:14,570 --> 02:19:14,930
Cute.

2023
02:19:15,370 --> 02:19:16,210

Wow.

2038
02:19:54,140 --> 02:19:55,840
What's the floor mean?

2039
02:19:57,780 --> 02:19:58,960
We're in seat 13.

2040
02:20:00,320 --> 02:20:01,720
Oh, oh, oh.

2041
02:20:02,380 --> 02:20:04,220

I like her art.

2045
02:20:15,500 --> 02:20:17,020
She has a webb.

2046
02:20:17,040 --> 02:20:18,140
that I read.

2047
02:20:20,460 --> 02:20:21,560
That's so funny.

2048
02:20:21,880 --> 02:20:23,700
This is the last place I expected to see her.

2049
02:20:28,360 --> 02:20:29,600
For free?

2050
02:20:30,340 --> 02:20:30,980
What's for free?

2051
02:20:33,140 --> 02:20:33,660
Cute.

2052
02:20:34,520 --> 02:20:40,320
Looks like a Cinderella girl's, like, card, you know.

2053
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:46,440
Ghost!

2054

Me too.

2055
02:20:50,180 --> 02:20:53,020
Oh gosh, that guy scared me again.

2056
02:20:53,860 --> 02:20:54,700
Oh, oh.

Oh.

2062
02:21:04,860 --> 02:21:06,120
This guy's got nothing.

2063
02:21:08,380 --> 02:21:09,380
This is economy class.

2064
02:21:09,560 --> 02:21:12,460
All these people affording these bentos, they're crazy.

2065
02:21:17,210 --> 02:21:17,910
Fun.

2066
02:21:18,890 --> 02:21:20,550

02:21:30,990 --> 02:21:33,490
The most dangerous sniper.

2070
02:21:40,430 --> 02:21:44,050
The most dangerous bento.

2071
02:21:47,410 --> 02:21:53,610
These people just get in there their normal ass faces like

There's Ollie.

2082
02:22:43,390 --> 02:22:44,710
That's not Ollie.

2083
02:22:55,370 --> 02:22:57,390
Okay, that's all of them after this.

2084
02:22:58,850 --> 02:23:00,690
Cute, cute, very rosin.

2085

02:23:02,390 --> 02:23:03,590
Oh, nope, nope, just kidding, sorry.

2087
02:23:04,430 --> 02:23:05,430
I almost missed some people.

2088
02:23:07,010 --> 02:23:07,190
Hello.

2089
02:23:07,850 --> 02:23:08,870

2094
02:23:18,150 --> 02:23:18,870

02:25:06,550 --> 02:25:09,150

I love the ones.

2122
02:25:10,550 --> 02:25:14,490

ham in them.

Oh, it was, oh my gosh, it was so delicious.
