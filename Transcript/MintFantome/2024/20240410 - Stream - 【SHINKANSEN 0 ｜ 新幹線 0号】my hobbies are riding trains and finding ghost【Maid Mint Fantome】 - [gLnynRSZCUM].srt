1
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,820
I forgot to do something.

2
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,290
She gone!

3
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,470
Hello!

4
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,310
Welcome back!

5
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,390
Master!

6
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,290
Lady!

7
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,950
Hello!

8
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,690
Hello!

9
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,890
Hello!

10
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,850
Are you monetized yet?

11
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,410
Does it look like I'm monetized yet?

12
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,310
Hello!

13
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,210
Hello!

14
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,050
Hello!

15
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,650
Hello!

16
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,230
Hello!

17
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,530
I think... maybe YouTube doesn't like me.

18
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,610
That's okay though.

19
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,590
I don't know why you guys are so like...

20
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,750
Get monetized!

21
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,690
Get monetized!

22
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,430
It happens when it happens, you guys.

23
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,010
It happens when it happens.

24
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,990
It's no worries.

25
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,650
Welcome to Shinkansen Zero!

26
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,190
Shinkansen...

27
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,670
This is Shinkansen Zero, headed to Tokyo!

28
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,870
That's what it says up there.

29
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,750
I can read.

30
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,270
I can RAID.

31
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,950
Futurama meme.

32
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,270
Yeah.

33
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,810
Cha-ching!

34
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,310
Cha-ching!

35
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:53,970
Cha-ching!

36
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,150
Cha-ching!

37
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,730
Get monetized!

38
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,590
Get monetized!

39
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,250
Cha-ching!

40
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:57,710
Cha-ching!

41
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,870
Get monetized!

42
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,750
Get monetized!

43
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:00,690
Cha-ching!

44
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,250
Cha-ching!

45
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,030
I haven't seen this Chilla's Art game yet.

46
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,370
Neither have I!

47
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,070
I just know a little bit about it, like I know...

48
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,670
Also, there's an easy mode!

49
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,410
If you make a mistake, you will go back by one.

50
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,730
Card number will not be reset.

51
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,170
Oh, okay.

52
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,710
I didn't really...

53
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,710
There's an easy mode!

54
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,990
Am I in easy mode?

55
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,390
Oh, I forgot to turn on the sound notifications for Donos.

56
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,130
Thank you guys for the Donos.

57
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:25,910
Give me one second.

58
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,930
Alert box.

59
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,750
Donations.

60
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,630
Not the McDonald's jingle.

61
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,070
Don't sue me.

62
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:44,990
McDonald's.

63
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,170
Ah, thank you!

64
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,270
Okay.

65
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,390
Since you're such a train otaku, can we get a train sim stream soon?

66
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:58,910
Oh my gosh!

67
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,590
I think otaku is a hard...

68
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,950
It's like a dramatic...

69
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,070
You know, I like trains.

70
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,150
But to say that I'm a train otaku is...

71
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,450
I think greatly over-exaggerating how much I know about trains.

72
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,250
Because I...

73
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,210
I just like to ride them.

74
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,230
Test.

75
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,090
Thank you!

76
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,850
Here's some bucks until monetization happens.

77
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:29,770
Thank you.

78
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,490
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

79
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,570
Train simp.

80
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,130
Yeah, I just like to really ride trains.

81
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:41,330
So...

82
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,410
Thank you, guys.

83
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,870
Thank you.

84
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,730
Can you even hear it?

85
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,870
Can you hear the notice?

86
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,550
I guess they don't have to be too loud.

87
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,770
As long as I hear it, right?

88
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,810
I don't know much about JP trains, but...

89
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,550
Is this the type of train that Donna Burke voices?

90
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:57,990
Yes!

91
00:06:59,170 --> 00:06:59,570
Yes!

92
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:00,530
She...

93
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,170
Um, Donna Burke...

94
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:02,990
Uh...

95
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,550
The...

96
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,350
One of the singers of Metal Gear and the voice of the iDroid.

97
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,110
She also is the voice on the Shinkansen.

98
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,510
Oh.

99
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,950
One of the voices.

100
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,350
I can't...

101
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,670
I...

102
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,330
Oh, gosh.

103
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,450
Nozomi?

104
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:18,730
Hikari?

105
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,650
All of them?

106
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,410
I don't remember.

107
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,210
But she is the English voice for the Shinkansen.

108
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,490
So if you take the Shinkansen, the bullet train, in Japan, you will hear her.

109
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:30,810
Yeah.

110
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,670
I did not know that.

111
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,030
Cool.

112
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:33,430
Yeah!

113
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,510
It's so cool, right?

114
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,490
I rode the Nozomi and heard her.

115
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,150
There you go!

116
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,290
There you go.

117
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,090
That's the Shinkansen.

118
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:40,870
I haven't...

119
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,130
I've ridden the Shinkansen a couple times before.

120
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,270
Not many times.

121
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:45,750
I...

122
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,330
I say couple.

123
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,410
Like, maybe four.

124
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,610
Like, one...

125
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:48,990
Like...

126
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,450
Like, two times?

127
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,010
So, we'll be going there and back.

128
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,950
So, four times total.

129
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:02,110
Um, but it was before I played Metal Gear, so I never even realized that it was her.

130
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,810
Thank you, guys.

131
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,690
Thank you!

132
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,570
Thank you again for the short karaoke stream yesterday.

133
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,170
I was happy to pull out my King Blades for you.

134
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,870
Thank you.

135
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,010
Thank you.

136
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,450
The train in this game is voiced by Chris Prye.

137
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,330
Aw, man!

138
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,310
I knew it!

139
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,250
I knew it!

140
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,190
BMG before Metal Gear.

141
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,750
We'll build our own mint voice train soon.

142
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:30,650
What?

143
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,570
I don't even know what they say.

144
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,750
This train is bound for...

145
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:36,970
Nagoya.

146
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,450
Nagoya.

147
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,190
Nagoya.

148
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:38,510
Nagoya.

149
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,150
Nagoya.

150
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,450
I know more what they say on the normal trains.

151
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,170
What do they say?

152
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,130
The doors on the right side will open.

153
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,170
What if I said it like really crazy, though?

154
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:58,190
Um, this train is headed to Tokyo.

155
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,770
Um, you can get off whenever you want in between then, I guess.

156
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,070
The next stop is, um, Shinagawa, maybe.

157
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,870
Um, are you sure you don't want to go to Akihabara?

158
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,230
Um, oh, oh, sorry, we're already here.

159
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,650
The doors are opening!

160
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,350
Get out, get out, get out!

161
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,470
Sorry, I didn't buy a ticket.

162
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,210
Get out!

163
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,350
Get out, get out!

164
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,570
Stepped out of moving train.

165
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:32,230
Uh-oh.

166
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,490
Akiba sucks now.

167
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:35,930
What the?

168
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,090
I'm putting you in timeout.

169
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,670
How dare you say that in my, in my, in my, in my chat.

170
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,890
Akihabara does not suck now?

171
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,150
How dare you say?

172
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,650
How dare?

173
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,190
How dare you?

174
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,550
We have a, we have a Ikebukuro believer over here.

175
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,390
We have...

176
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,950
We have, we have someone who's just like, Oh yeah, go to...

177
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,450
Go to Sunshine City, it's so much better.

178
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,110
Thank you!

179
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,610
Fun fact, Annaburke also does the English audio for the 2020 Olympic Stadium Tour at the Tokyo National Stadium.

180
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,190
Oh, really?

181
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,130
I guess I'll have to go.

182
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,370
She does something else.

183
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,630
It's her in Nanoha, right?

184
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:27,930
I don't remember.

185
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,950
Oh my gosh, you guys, thank you!

186
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,810
Oh my gosh.

187
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,550
So many staff!

188
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,930
I mean, I can finally catch a livestream.

189
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,630
I never got to say welcome back.

190
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:41,270
So welcome back!

191
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,090
Thank you so much!

192
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,730
Our next stop is Tuesday.

193
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,690
The next station is Yureimachi.

194
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,210
The ghost town, for real.

195
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:59,410
This game is one of those games where you have like the anomalies that you have to spot.

196
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,250
Right?

197
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,730
Pretty sure that's all you do.

198
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,390
You try to escape the train is what I imagine.

199
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,250
I kind of like the ones where you have to find the anomalies.

200
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,090
I actually really like hidden object games and things like that.

201
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:23,070
So these kind of scratch like a certain itch that I really enjoy.

202
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,910
Like Observation Duty?

203
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,830
I think so.

204
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,830
I think so.

205
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,130
So...

206
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,410
Is this like the exit game?

207
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,390
I'm pretty sure.

208
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:34,870
But...

209
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:36,770
But...

210
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,370
But on a train.

211
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,210
Were you an iSpy book enjoyer when you were young?

212
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,010
Absolute...

213
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:46,610
Oh my gosh!

214
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,950
Oh my gosh!

215
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,410
You just...

216
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:48,930
Oh my gosh!

217
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,110
You just unlocked a memory for me.

218
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,710
I...

219
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:57,610
Another children's game that I would play all the time was the iSpy Spooky Mansion.

220
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,310
Like I...

221
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:02,790
I didn't own any of the other iSpy games on the computer.

222
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,690
I only owned the...

223
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,650
The spooky...

224
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,850
The Haunted Mansion one.

225
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,650
And I really liked when the skeleton would crawl around.

226
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,770
It was so fun.

227
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,450
Oh my gosh!

228
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,310
Maybe I can find a way to stream that one too.

229
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:19,830
I'm gonna have to...

230
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:26,310
I'm gonna have to like buy a Windows 95 computer or something to be able to run these games.

231
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:29,910
Hmm...

232
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,710
I didn't have the book.

233
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,050
I only had the game.

234
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:34,790
The computer game.

235
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,090
But it was so fun.

236
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,770
It was so fun.

237
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,090
So awesome.

238
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,390
So thank you for unlocking that memory.

239
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:48,630
Actually there was like at the end of the game when you beat it, like the skeleton I think he would like crawl out of the chimney.

240
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,750
And I always loved that part.

241
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,230
Spooky skeleton.

242
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:57,590
Hope you enjoyed this video.

243
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,050
The ghost was cool.

244
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,230
Yeah, he would be in every puzzle.

245
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,890
So fun.

246
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,810
Horror edutainment.

247
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,010
I loved...

248
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:06,210
I...

249
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,170
I'm telling you.

250
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,810
I don't think I've changed much from when I was a kid.

251
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,670
I've always loved horror so much.

252
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,270
I've always been like this.

253
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:20,150
Where if something was like spooky themed, I'd be like, that's my favorite.

254
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,670
Halloween was the best time ever for me.

255
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,470
Especially because my parents would get really into it too.

256
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:35,250
My dad loved decorating the house.

257
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:42,090
And there was even like some special Halloween decorations that he like created himself.

258
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:47,970
And then even when I got older, him and our neighbor...

259
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:48,870
The neighbor...

260
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:49,970
They would like...

261
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,710
At the neighbor's house, they would help...

262
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:55,890
My dad would help the neighbor set up a haunted mansion in the neighbor's house.

263
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:56,650
For like...

264
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,430
Kids to go through and stuff as a kid.

265
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,870
Well, I wasn't really a kid at that time.

266
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,070
But so...

267
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:03,790
Yeah.

268
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,450
I just had a family that also loved...

269
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,110
Halloween.

270
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,510
So maybe that also influenced me.

271
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,450
I don't know.

272
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,110
I don't really know.

273
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,750
I'm just...

274
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,310
I'm just not like other...

275
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,230
Other ghosts.

276
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,410
I like Halloween.

277
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:21,590
Okay.

278
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,230
New game?

279
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,210
Yeah.

280
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,350
I haven't started at all.

281
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,430
So there's nothing to over...

282
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:32,910
Over...

283
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:35,670
Save.

284
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,590
Whatever the word is.

285
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,410
Whoa.

286
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,090
The sensitivity on this is kind of insane.

287
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:42,850
Whoa.

288
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:43,570
Whoa.

289
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,150
Whoa.

290
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,890
Settings of sensitivity.

291
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,090
Let's put it down like here.

292
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,470
Let's do crosshair also.

293
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,310
So you guys can see what I'm looking at.

294
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:55,510
Okay.

295
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,330
Where's the crosshair?

296
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:01,790
Never mind.

297
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:02,970
That was volume?

298
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,510
No.

299
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,090
Are you kidding me?

300
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,030
Oh.

301
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,090
I thought he...

302
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,590
It's so funny because even after I changed it, I was like, that's much better.

303
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,510
Okay.

304
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,190
That's...

305
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:25,930
That's actually...

306
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:26,370
That's better.

307
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,010
I...

308
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,410
I...

309
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,150
What's...

310
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:31,430
I...

311
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,030
Placebo affected myself.

312
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,010
Oh.

313
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,570
That's funny.

314
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,910
Okay.

315
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,390
Oh.

316
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:41,890
Oh.

317
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:43,950
Oh.

318
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:44,210
Nothing.

319
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,150
Grandma.

320
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,650
Why does this look so strange?

321
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,230
Oh.

322
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:52,910
Her phone is literally...

323
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,730
Why does this look?

324
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,010
Why does she look just AI generated or something?

325
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:01,490
Hey.

326
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,390
It's Matara.

327
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:03,650
Hey.

328
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,370
Don't say that.

329
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:04,850
Rule.

330
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,670
What's the rules?

331
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,430
Hey.

332
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,670
I'm going to Japan around Halloween and I'd love to see an idol show while I'm there.

333
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,930
Any recommendations for beginners?

334
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,090
Oh gosh.

335
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:19,990
Halloween is like such an awesome time to go because there's so many...

336
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,210
I'm just kidding.

337
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,130
Oh, who's in there?

338
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,110
There's so many shows going on.

339
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,210
It's harder to say, only because I feel like you should...

340
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,070
There's the crosshairs.

341
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,790
It's easier to know the idol group and...

342
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,530
and like find them that way, you know?

343
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,170
Thank you.

344
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,700
Perhaps you'll be interested in playing short horror games from Ichiyo someday.

345
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,960
There's a couple of really good ones.

346
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

347
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,940
For sure, for sure, for sure.

348
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,200
Maybe we can do like a group of like short horror games.

349
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,980
Kind of like play like, I don't know, three or four or something in a stream.

350
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,700
Okay.

351
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,020
I can't see where I'm clicking.

352
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,460
This way, right?

353
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,640
Wait, what if I try opening this one?

354
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Oh, my bad.

355
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,360
Open.

356
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,420
I can't tell.

357
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,180
Is there a crosshair or not?

358
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,220
I'm not crazy, right?

359
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,820
I can't tell where I'm clicking.

360
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,920
I'm just curious.

361
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,000
Oh.

362
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,580
This Home Alone kid.

363
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,260
Oh, my God.

364
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,320
What is this ad?

365
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,120
On the train.

366
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,600
Sorry.

367
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,200
My sound scared me.

368
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,200
Okay.

369
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,760
Here we go.

370
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,500
Oh.

371
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,220
Turn back if there is an anomaly.

372
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,440
Speaking of Ichiyo horror games, I would die of happiness if you played Voices of the Void.

373
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,160
Never heard of...

374
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,960
Oh, my God.

375
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,200
Cat Cafe.

376
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,060
You guys, I'm going to be honest.

377
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,520
Cat cafes, I went to a couple while I was in Japan.

378
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,640
And they're just not worth it.

379
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:34,120
Even, like, it never scratched that itch that I had of wanting cat time.

380
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:40,260
And usually, the cats are, like, are so uninterested because they're messed with all the time.

381
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:40,980
You know what I mean?

382
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,560
So, it's just...

383
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,660
There is one that I like to go to called Nekojalala in Akihabara.

384
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,040
It's kind of, like, off the path.

385
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:52,900
So...

386
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:55,720
It's good.

387
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,600
Is that a person?

388
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,280
Oh, no.

389
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,180
Oh, there's an anomaly.

390
00:18:59,360 --> 00:18:59,640
Turn back.

391
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,640
Turn back.

392
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,000
Turn back.

393
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,300
Turn back.

394
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,150
So, I go here?

395
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:08,870
Oh.

396
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,090
Oh, wait.

397
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,730
People aren't anomalies.

398
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,910
You say that.

399
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,250
They are to me.

400
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,150
To be fair, that's how owning a cat is, too, most of the time.

401
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,010
I don't...

402
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:26,290
No.

403
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,530
My cat is very...

404
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,950
Can I crouch?

405
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:30,670
No.

406
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,650
Can I run?

407
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:32,970
I...

408
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,410
Uh-oh.

409
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:33,910
Uh-oh.

410
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,470
You can run.

411
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,330
Okay.

412
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,230
I'm a salary man.

413
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,540
Oh, my God.

414
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,740
This guy is balding.

415
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,040
Oh, he kind of looks like broccoli.

416
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,520
Hey, wake up.

417
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,600
Are you an anomaly?

418
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,160
Sorry.

419
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,680
I'm afraid to click on him.

420
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,780
Are you?

421
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,600
Okay.

422
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,120
Okay.

423
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:06,860
We're fine.

424
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,880
Run, run, run.

425
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,880
He's gonna chase us.

426
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,460
Oh, my God.

427
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,020
He's chasing us.

428
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,420
Okay.

429
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,280
Are there anomalies in here, too?

430
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:17,880
Or...

431
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,460
Wait.

432
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,540
Is that suitcase supposed to be there?

433
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,680
I'm sorry.

434
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,320
Oh, my God.

435
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,760
Oh, my God.

436
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,060
Oh, my God.

437
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,080
Oh, my God.

438
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,140
Oh, my God.

439
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:26,820
We're real poor.

440
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,020
We're gonna steal the pen.

441
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,380
Oh, my God.

442
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,440
Oh, my Gosh.

443
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,020
Oh, God.

444
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,590
He's using the tablet, right?

445
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,450
Open this case.

446
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,170
Open this case.

447
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:49,910
Oh, man.

448
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,490
What I see with you today...

449
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,030
This account is having some troubles right now.

450
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:52,910
This account is far from being locked up.

451
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,110
Oh, hello.

452
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,230
What?

453
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,670
What are you doing there?

454
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,950
Hello!

455
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,690
Thank you, thank you so much.

456
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,850
I'm sorry.

457
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,150
Hello!

458
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,710
Thank you so much.

459
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:25,710
I'm sorry.

460
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,670
I'm so sorry.

461
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,890
I'm a little jumpy because of the caffeine, I think.

462
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,910
I've heard they don't even serve real cat at a cat cafe.

463
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,530
It's some kind of mock cat.

464
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,290
Stop!

465
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,270
How dare you!

466
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,990
That kid was staring at an anomaly.

467
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,470
Would you be interested in playing Lifeline?

468
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,730
It's a voice controlled horror game.

469
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:07,770
Clippers will go mad.

470
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:08,150
Oh!

471
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,570
That sounds fun.

472
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,590
Yeah, I'd totally be interested in that.

473
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,650
Today we learned that kids scare the ectoplasm out of ghosts.

474
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,370
What are you doing?

475
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,830
I'm just, you know, walking between cards.

476
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,790
I'm being a menace.

477
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:24,610
We meet again.

478
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,010
Wait.

479
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,110
Did you come to play a game?

480
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:31,610
Wait, looping?

481
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,550
I'm so excited.

482
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:35,490
Oh, sorry.

483
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,350
I should be reading this.

484
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,710
I think I'm walking a little bit of it.

485
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,270
I'm super excited.

486
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,690
I'm bored because my sister won't wake up.

487
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,550
I was really bored here because my sister's not waking up.

488
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,170
Oh, I wonder why.

489
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,110
No matter how long I wait.

490
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,090
No matter how long I wait.

491
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,010
She doesn't seem to open her eyes.

492
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:55,950
She doesn't seem to open her eyes.

493
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:56,690
Remint.

494
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,350
But my brother will play the game for me.

495
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,490
I'm fine now.

496
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,670
But now that I have you to play the game, I feel better.

497
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,290
So he's looping also.

498
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,390
Do you know the rules of the game?

499
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:09,870
I don't know.

500
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,550
The rules are very easy.

501
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,350
The rules are simple.

502
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,730
If something changes, I'll come back.

503
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,350
It's easy, right?

504
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:18,790
Oh.

505
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,750
See something off in the train?

506
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:21,390
Turn back.

507
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:26,750
You know, maybe you should subtitle the whole thing so I know, you know, that you're not gonna keep talking.

508
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,030
Want to finish the game?

509
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:29,770
That is...

510
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:34,570
Just go to car 0 and hit the brakes in the driver's room.

511
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:34,890
Oh.

512
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,010
Get to car 0 and hit the brakes in the conductor's room.

513
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,890
The train in the bathroom won't change.

514
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,690
That explains that.

515
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,850
There are no anomalies in the restroom area.

516
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,390
That sounds... fake.

517
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,650
Why can I open the door then?

518
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,190
If there's no anomalies in the restroom area.

519
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,710
Why can I open the door?

520
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,910
And why is it in green?

521
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,770
Hmm.

522
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:01,850
Kinda sus.

523
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,910
Do you want me to explain again?

524
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,110
Got it.

525
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,790
Uh, yes, I got it.

526
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:07,990
That's good.

527
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:08,990
Good.

528
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,310
I'm not dealing with an idiot.

529
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:11,650
That's good.

530
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:12,850
See you later.

531
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,290
I'll see you at the end then.

532
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,570
The end of the world or...

533
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,050
Okay, kid.

534
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,570
And to you too, little lady.

535
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,850
I like her dress.

536
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,570
Looks like something I would wear actually.

537
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,420
But what if it like opens, you know?

538
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,100
I don't know.

539
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,020
Oh.

540
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,720
Eh?

541
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,680
Isn't this the same as before?

542
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,300
Mister.

543
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,500
I'm scared to talk to him.

544
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,920
Now it starts.

545
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,460
Okay.

546
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,020
So...

547
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,540
What kind of thing would count as an anomaly?

548
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,720
Like...

549
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,300
Um...

550
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,720
What?

551
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,480
Are they still here?

552
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,080
I wonder.

553
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,560
Oh gosh.

554
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,790
Looks like an anomaly.

555
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,190
Ah!

556
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,430
Wait, is he...

557
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,130
The kid turned into the blob.

558
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,870
The kid turned into a lump of flesh.

559
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,310
Wait, is this an anomaly?

560
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,410
Or...

561
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:34,650
Hello?

562
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,750
Is that a person?

563
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,790
Hey, kid.

564
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:40,730
Are you okay up there?

565
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,430
This is...

566
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,030
Okay.

567
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:44,790
This is...

568
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,090
Okay.

569
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:45,750
You know how...

570
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,350
Um...

571
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,090
Tickets are getting more and more expensive for places.

572
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,290
And...

573
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:51,990
Now...

574
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,910
These tickets cost the same as like a business class.

575
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,730
And this is like the economy.

576
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:57,590
They're...

577
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,330
They're just...

578
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:58,890
You know...

579
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,530
They're sticking people wherever they can to make a profit.

580
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:02,450
So...

581
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:02,870
This is like...

582
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,810
This is actually our future right here, you guys.

583
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,510
I think I should turn around.

584
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,380
I think that's an anomaly.

585
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,140
And so now it will say six.

586
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:21,760
Right?

587
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,060
Yippee!

588
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:25,860
Okay.

589
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Cat cafe.

590
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,180
Headed to Tokyo.

591
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,960
Very good.

592
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,070
Let's see.

593
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,190
Well, it's a good thing we noticed the flesh.

594
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:41,650
Thing.

595
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,110
Whatever that was up there.

596
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,330
Um...

597
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:47,930
Ooh.

598
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,410
I'm scared.

599
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,950
Huh.

600
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:51,510
Huh.

601
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,950
Huh.

602
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:53,670
Huh.

603
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:54,910
Hmm.

604
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:55,490
Hmm.

605
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,150
Numbers are counting.

606
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,070
Seven.

607
00:26:59,250 --> 00:26:59,890
Seven!

608
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,370
Maybe I'm tripping.

609
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:05,890
Okay.

610
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,330
It's back to being a suitcase.

611
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,030
A sister is still asleep.

612
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,050
Uh...

613
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:11,270
I don't know.

614
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,450
Uh...

615
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:12,890
Nurse?

616
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,670
I don't know how much of this I need to remember.

617
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:18,550
Oh!

618
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:18,890
Gosh!

619
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,250
Look everywhere.

620
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:22,890
Okay.

621
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,910
The numbers are numbering.

622
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:25,190
Yes.

623
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,770
He got folded like an omelet.

624
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:28,490
Deep.

625
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,010
Okay.

626
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,430
I think the game...

627
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,550
I think it's just the game doing that.

628
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,810
These look...

629
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,670
Everything looks normal.

630
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,770
Anything under the seats?

631
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:40,370
Nothing.

632
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,270
Nothing.

633
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:46,350
Anyone forget a soda in the seats or anything?

634
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,110
This guy still got his shoes...

635
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,170
Oh!

636
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:50,150
Oh.

637
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:50,610
Never mind.

638
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,170
Hello?

639
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:52,310
Oh!

640
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:52,690
He's awake!

641
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,010
Is he?

642
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:56,750
Actually...

643
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,150
I can't tell.

644
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,190
Are you?

645
00:27:59,370 --> 00:27:59,790
Okay.

646
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,490
I think we're good.

647
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,410
Take his shoes.

648
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,540
Then it won't be an omelet.

649
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,540
How will we know if it's an anomaly or not if we take his shoes?

650
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,270
One last look of things.

651
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:28,630
I don't see anything in the windows like if there's a creature following me.

652
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,610
I don't know if that's a thing either.

653
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,890
We continue onward.

654
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,870
No anomaly in this area.

655
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,210
Okay.

656
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:37,790
If you...

657
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,090
If you say so.

658
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,270
I don't believe you.

659
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:42,810
What?

660
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,050
What did I miss?

661
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,370
Okay.

662
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,010
No way!

663
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,610
What did I miss?

664
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,890
It looked so normal.

665
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:52,710
Okay.

666
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,150
It's fine.

667
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,030
It's fine.

668
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,690
We just started.

669
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,350
Whatever.

670
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:57,830
I don't care.

671
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,390
It's fine.

672
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:01,830
Check the windows.

673
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,130
I have been looking.

674
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,270
Like, do I have to check each window individually?

675
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:07,950
Hmm.

676
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,710
Hmm.

677
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:11,990
Hmm.

678
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,250
It's so quiet.

679
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,370
The ambience is scary.

680
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:14,830
It scares me.

681
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,530
This is the suitcase and...

682
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,370
She's gone!

683
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,030
She's gone.

684
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:21,390
She's gone.

685
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:21,570
Go!

686
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:22,950
Go!

687
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,170
Go!

688
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:23,350
Go!

689
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:23,490
Go!

690
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:23,630
Go!

691
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:23,910
Go!

692
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:24,330
Go!

693
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:24,430
Go!

694
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:24,790
Go!

695
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,150
Go!

696
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:28,990
Let's go.

697
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,270
Are we okay?

698
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,700
We have a six!

699
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,540
Okay.

700
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,060
Okay.

701
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:38,560
Okay.

702
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:38,920
Okay.

703
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,740
Okay.

704
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,440
We're going to Tokyo!

705
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,920
Okay.

706
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,320
Hmm.

707
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,620
He still got his shoes.

708
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,680
Everything seems okay.

709
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,420
The seats are proper.

710
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,900
Oh, wait!

711
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,460
That's so funny.

712
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,200
Okay, she's here!

713
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:09,800
She's here!

714
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,200
She's here!

715
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,660
I'm scared.

716
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,700
Headed to Tokyo.

717
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,620
I don't know how small the details will be.

718
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,100
Like these?

719
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,360
Sometimes it's hard to say with these observation games.

720
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,360
Because sometimes they're like, you need to know...

721
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,660
Did I hear a footstep?

722
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,520
No...

723
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,020
I didn't hear a footstep, right?

724
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,400
Okay, let's look at the windows.

725
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,000
Look at my strut!

726
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,800
I'm stuck on something.

727
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,260
Hmm...

728
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,660
Oh, it looks normal!

729
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,380
But it looked normal before, too!

730
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:08,570
Hmm...

731
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:10,790
Hmm...

732
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:12,410
Hmm...

733
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:18,570
I don't know why I'm so impressed that he is also in this reflection as well.

734
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,170
Maybe because, I don't know...

735
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:26,290
It's just like a small detail that I didn't think they would pay attention to.

736
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,550
I don't know, I think we're good, you guys.

737
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,450
I think we're good to move forward.

738
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:35,910
Right?

739
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:36,870
Yeah, there she is.

740
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,050
She's still asleep.

741
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:42,390
Hmm...

742
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,110
Reflections...

743
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,930
I've been looking...

744
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,790
Do I have to go down the whole thing?

745
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,210
La la la la la...

746
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,610
Look at me.

747
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,810
I look like I'm so vain.

748
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,770
Like, I just love looking at my reflection.

749
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,410
Like...

750
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,570
Why am I posing for the camera?

751
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,350
Yeah, it looks normal.

752
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,070
Tokyo!

753
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,730
Tokyo calling!

754
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,290
Tokyo calling!

755
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,790
Tokyo calling!

756
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,470
Five!

757
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,570
It looks a little darker.

758
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,890
Is it just me?

759
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,170
Headed to Tokyo.

760
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,650
Do you guys know that song?

761
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,290
Tokyo Calling by Atarashii Gakkou.

762
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,330
Hello, mister.

763
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,890
Just making sure you're okay.

764
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,050
It looks darker here, right?

765
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,930
It definitely looks darker right there.

766
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,210
Maybe that's the anomaly.

767
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,200
I do.

768
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,760
I was obsessed with it for like a week.

769
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,160
Yeah!

770
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,080
It's so good.

771
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,240
When is it?

772
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,060
When is it?

773
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,180
The game being the game?

774
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:24,860
And when is it?

775
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,520
Oh, she's here.

776
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,400
No, I think...

777
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,200
Maybe it isn't darker.

778
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,560
Maybe it's my imagination.

779
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,560
Ah!

780
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,070
Ah!

781
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:46,750
Ah!

782
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,150
Five!

783
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:50,350
Five!

784
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,600
Shinkansen Zero headed to Tokyo!

785
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,080
One day...

786
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,720
What if it says, headed to hell?

787
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,160
I feel like one of the anomalies has to be that, right?

788
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,680
I also have a question.

789
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,340
Is this a game where it's always random?

790
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,280
Or is it a game where each level is always the same?

791
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,240
Because I know with some of these, you have to like play them over and over again to see all the different kinds of anomalies.

792
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,180
Oh, it is random.

793
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:30,860
Cool, cool.

794
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,590
Oh, I'm too afraid to get close to him.

795
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,510
I'm afraid of people.

796
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:44,370
Okay.

797
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:49,870
So now, we have to make one... we have to make a lap up and down.

798
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:53,190
To make sure there's no seat people.

799
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:56,410
What if he grabbed... what if he grabbed me?

800
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,110
Okay.

801
00:34:59,070 --> 00:34:59,670
Alright.

802
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:00,990
Alright.

803
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:02,570
And...

804
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,330
Let's look this way.

805
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,970
We're looking at the reflections too.

806
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,750
We're making sure there's no one here.

807
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,570
Looking at the reflections on the chairs.

808
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,890
Nothing that I can see.

809
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,230
Okay.

810
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:22,330
Okay.

811
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,070
Okay.

812
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:29,850
Hello, mister.

813
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,130
Hope you're doing well.

814
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,230
Just stay right there.

815
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,910
Looked like almost Ronald McDonald was in the seat.

816
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:43,670
Wasn't it?

817
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,370
The guy sitting there last time.

818
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,050
I think we're good.

819
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,870
I think we are okay to move on.

820
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:56,550
It always feels weirder that there's no anomalies than there being an anomaly.

821
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,230
You know what I mean?

822
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:08,890
Let's go.

823
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,570
Was that flickering meaning that I messed up?

824
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:19,090
Am I gonna have to hide in the bathroom at some point?

825
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,510
Oh!

826
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,470
Nice!

827
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:21,910
Nice!

828
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:22,190
Nice!

829
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:22,390
Nice!

830
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:22,490
Nice!

831
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:22,530
Nice!

832
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,490
Okay, headed to Tokyo!

833
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,070
Alrighty!

834
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:30,730
Very good!

835
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:31,650
Very good!

836
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,270
Very good!

837
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:32,830
Very good!

838
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,570
I like psych myself out.

839
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,790
I'm like, what if he's gonna lunge at me?

840
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,210
What if he's...

841
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,270
Chuu!

842
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,130
The anomaly is there's a cute ghost on this train.

843
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,230
Where?

844
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:51,810
Oh gosh, I'm scared.

845
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,170
Okay, she's here.

846
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:00,950
Alright.

847
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,290
There has to be something here though.

848
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,830
Right?

849
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,750
There's gotta be something.

850
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,270
Behind me?

851
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,140
What's behind me?

852
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,240
Where?

853
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:23,940
Where?

854
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,020
What's behind me?

855
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:26,960
Where?

856
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,040
Where?

857
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,040
What's behind me?

858
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,240
Where?

859
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:29,260
Where?

860
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:29,260
What's behind me?

861
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:29,420
Under there.

862
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,200
Under where?

863
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,100
Okay, let's start here.

864
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,160
I think it's the...

865
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,440
The issue is I...

866
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,320
Don't know what all kind of anomalies we can get.

867
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:44,780
You know?

868
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,000
Uhhh...

869
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,400
Shoe's still on.

870
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,300
Hmm.

871
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:02,660
Hmm.

872
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,220
Hmm.

873
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,220
Suitcase.

874
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:05,620
Suitcase.

875
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,960
Better not to bring like your suitcase though on.

876
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:11,840
Because...

877
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,400
You know.

878
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,180
Takes up a lot of space.

879
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,620
It's not such a big one.

880
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,400
I mean you can always store it above too.

881
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:21,480
Hmm.

882
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,520
Ch-ch-choo.

883
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,500
Ch-ch-choo.

884
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,600
Choo-choo-choo.

885
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:27,860
Choo-choo-choo.

886
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,400
Choo -choo-choo.

887
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,820
Choo-choo-choo.

888
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,760
Choo-choo-choo.

889
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:30,780
Choo -choo -choo.

890
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:30,840
Choo -choo -choo.

891
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,400
Choo-choo-choo.

892
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,940
Choo-choo-choo.

893
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,660
I don't know, you guys.

894
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,780
I think this one looks good too.

895
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,780
Do they serve food on these trains?

896
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,720
Usually, yeah.

897
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,600
Usually, yeah.

898
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,660
But it's not like... you have to buy it.

899
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,460
It's not like an international flight sometimes when they give you food.

900
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,040
Suitcase missing?

901
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,120
No, it's up there.

902
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,500
Someone said one of the lights was flashing.

903
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,200
Is that true?

904
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,900
Or was that just the game being silly?

905
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,820
I'll check again.

906
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,580
Was that the game?

907
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:18,400
I can't tell if the light adjusting is the game or...

908
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,320
Let's see.

909
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,340
Okay.

910
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:24,760
Okay.

911
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,360
Like I'm... Okay.

912
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,480
Okay.

913
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,320
Okay.

914
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,180
Okay.

915
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,520
Getting through these seats.

916
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,380
My god.

917
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,660
See you like that!

918
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,040
See you like...

919
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:40,940
Okay.

920
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,100
Flashing lights?

921
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,540
Maybe.

922
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,540
I don't know what that would even mean.

923
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,740
Okay.

924
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,920
Okay.

925
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,440
I think we're good.

926
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,200
I think I'm being a little paranoid, but it's fine.

927
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,020
Oh god!

928
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,220
Jeez!

929
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,580
Okay.

930
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,280
Alright.

931
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,280
It says no anomalies in this area, but I don't believe it.

932
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,860
I think I see the anomaly.

933
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,260
Why does she get to sit down, but he's standing up?

934
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,440
Also, he's huge!

935
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,340
He's ginormous!

936
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,140
Do you think he'll come at me?

937
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,620
Is she looking at me?

938
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,680
No.

939
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,260
Can't tell.

940
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,600
Go say hi.

941
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,460
This kind of looks like the inside of a plane.

942
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,860
He eats his broccoli every day.

943
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:09,240
I need to clean the middle of the cart a little bit better.

944
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,450
No, she looks the same as before, I think.

945
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,390
She's still, like, moving her head around.

946
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,190
I'm scared!

947
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:29,730
Is he gonna come after me?

948
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,010
I don't wanna lose!

949
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,230
You guys were on cart two!

950
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,350
We're so close!

951
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:35,970
Look out the window.

952
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,630
Well, this is just normal.

953
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,650
It's just me.

954
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:42,450
It's just me.

955
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,390
Oh my god, you can see him standing there, though.

956
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,090
This guy is an absolute unit.

957
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:52,130
His torso is so long!

958
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,410
Wait, how tall are we?

959
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:57,230
Okay, I don't want him to come after me, but I wanna compare our heights.

960
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,430
I have a bit of a complex, okay?

961
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,310
Armstrong, real.

962
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:07,510
Don't turn around!

963
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,470
Don't do it!

964
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:11,490
Don't do it!

965
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,640
His torso is so long!

966
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,380
I just wanna see what he looks like, you know?

967
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,270
Don't look at me.

968
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,690
He's got boobs.

969
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,740
Oh my god!

970
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:52,950
My curiosity has been satiated.

971
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:58,450
One!

972
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:00,070
Baby!

973
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:01,870
Yippee!

974
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:08,090
This is Shinkansen Zero, headed to Tokyo!

975
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:20,870
See, don't you feel more comfortable sitting and relaxing and...

976
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:24,150
Let's see.

977
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,150
That looks like a suitcase.

978
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:30,110
Let's get to the end of the cart and assess.

979
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,110
Before we do anything else.

980
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:33,730
Is there a...

981
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,070
Any other people?

982
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,030
That I might have missed?

983
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,630
Okay, suitcase is normal.

984
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:41,430
Sister is there.

985
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,070
Sleep.

986
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:43,970
No one there.

987
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:44,690
No one there.

988
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:46,710
Nurse.

989
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:47,650
Doctor.

990
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:49,830
Okay.

991
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:54,310
He doesn't look that tall when he's sitting down.

992
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:55,650
Um...

993
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,990
Maybe he has, like, heels on or something.

994
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,740
Don't they make those kinds of...

995
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,740
Gosh.

996
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,060
Those, like...

997
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:07,360
They...

998
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:13,480
Don't they make some shoes for guys that, like, don't look like heels but actually are?

999
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,120
Just to give them a couple...

1000
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,260
A little boost?

1001
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,360
Maybe?

1002
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,460
What?

1003
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,660
No, maybe...

1004
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,620
Maybe I'm just...

1005
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,060
I don't know.

1006
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:26,780
Something looked off.

1007
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,420
Maybe I'm wrong.

1008
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,600
Platform shoes?

1009
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,180
I don't know if they're exactly platform shoes, but...

1010
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,520
Tom Cruise special?

1011
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,840
How tall is Tom Cruise?

1012
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,420
I feel very short on this.

1013
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,540
Like, my character.

1014
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,080
Wait, this looks normal, you guys.

1015
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,580
You guys, this looks normal!

1016
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,240
What do we do?

1017
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:58,470
It looks too normal!

1018
00:44:58,690 --> 00:44:59,610
It looks too average!

1019
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:01,390
The numbers...

1020
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:02,450
What do they mean?

1021
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:03,870
They're...

1022
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:04,250
They're...

1023
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:05,450
Oh, yeah.

1024
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:05,830
I see.

1025
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,090
This one's kind of flat.

1026
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:07,450
Oh!

1027
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,270
Wait.

1028
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:10,570
The...

1029
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:13,990
The lights weren't acting like this before, were they?

1030
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,290
Or am I just crazy?

1031
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,920
I can't tell.

1032
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,210
Like, if they were like that before or not.

1033
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:35,470
Okay.

1034
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:36,570
Check the reflection.

1035
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:39,410
I'm checking my reflection.

1036
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:41,090
There we go.

1037
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:42,150
There were no other people in the scene.

1038
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:42,450
That's right.

1039
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:43,590
I didn't miss any...

1040
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,450
I didn't miss anyone, right?

1041
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:53,810
The strut.

1042
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:54,170
I know.

1043
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,010
Look at me go.

1044
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,280
I look like...

1045
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,220
I'm such a child.

1046
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:15,120
I didn't pay attention at all, but I'm just gonna believe...

1047
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,520
I can't tell if they were playing it like this before.

1048
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,040
Oh, look at that.

1049
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:22,280
Package area.

1050
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:23,380
Oh, yeah.

1051
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:23,800
Oh, look at that.

1052
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:23,900
Oh, yeah.

1053
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,220
Oh, yeah.

1054
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,060
She went to the healthcare center.

1055
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:25,600
Things like this.

1056
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,180
Okay.

1057
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,820
Headed for Tokyo.

1058
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:29,680
Yes.

1059
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,700
Everything else looks right.

1060
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,620
Cat Cafe.

1061
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:35,740
Okay.

1062
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,080
I'm getting paranoid.

1063
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:38,840
Right?

1064
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,580
I don't know.

1065
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,000
I don't know what else could be wrong.

1066
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,220
Looks normal.

1067
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,600
I think it is.

1068
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,400
You guys?

1069
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,800
I think this is a plain Jane train.

1070
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:52,980
Whoa.

1071
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,300
Oh, my.

1072
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:57,560
Alrighty.

1073
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,320
No turning back.

1074
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,800
No way.

1075
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,120
Headed to Tokyo?

1076
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,580
We did it?

1077
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,580
Did I beat the game?

1078
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:17,080
Hey kid.

1079
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:48,200
Ugh.

1080
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,400
Are we okay?

1081
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,140
Everybody?

1082
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,400
That didn't scare us at all, did it?

1083
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,300
We were fine.

1084
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,920
We were totally whatever.

1085
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,320
Wait, do I need to turn back on this one?

1086
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,020
Are there anomalies here?

1087
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,020
It doesn't say if there's an anomaly turned back.

1088
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,340
Song suggestions?

1089
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,180
I think you'd slay at.

1090
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,220
Oh, I do know Melodies of Life!

1091
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,700
I'll check it out, thank you.

1092
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,980
I've been able to catch many streams due to work.

1093
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:38,560
It's okay.

1094
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,600
I've only done like three.

1095
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,680
Congrats on another episode of the podcast.

1096
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:45,520
Thank you so much!

1097
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,020
Thank you!

1098
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:48,760
Good luck with work!

1099
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,420
Wait, so I can just go forward here?

1100
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,880
Just go forward?

1101
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:53,280
Okay.

1102
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,440
Ah!

1103
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:08,310
What's happening?

1104
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:09,130
What's going on?

1105
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:09,690
Children?

1106
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:10,210
Children?

1107
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:10,750
What's going on?

1108
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:11,770
What's happening?

1109
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:12,150
Where?

1110
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:13,310
What's going on?

1111
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:15,010
What's happening?

1112
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:20,790
Personal?

1113
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:22,590
Oh.

1114
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,750
We stopped momentarily due to an injury.

1115
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:29,690
Oh.

1116
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:33,890
There's no plan for the train to stop at this moment.

1117
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:39,270
Please excuse the delay.

1118
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:39,610
Wait, where did he go?

1119
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:40,150
Attention please.

1120
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:40,370
Oh.

1121
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:44,030
We have stopped momentarily due to an injury.

1122
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:44,930
This is too real.

1123
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:47,910
There is no plan for the train to stop at this moment.

1124
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:50,310
Please excuse the delay.

1125
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:52,230
Thank you!

1126
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:53,770
Wait...

1127
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:55,090
The... the injury?

1128
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:56,410
Was it you?

1129
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,440
Please excuse the delay.

1130
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,020
Wait, where did...

1131
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:06,540
The injury?

1132
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,600
Oh,

1133
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,360
I just go inside.

1134
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:13,800
Okay.

1135
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:14,840
Just kidding.

1136
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,940
One second...

1137
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:27,110
One second...

1138
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,320
Clear blue car.

1139
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,300
Wait.

1140
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,180
What do you mean?

1141
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,400
Clear blue car?

1142
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,480
What do you mean by that?

1143
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,560
What are you... Oh.

1144
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,760
Did you wash your hands?

1145
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:01,760
Mister!

1146
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,140
Looks like you made it!

1147
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,400
Why did you translate this part?

1148
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,960
You thought this was the conductor's room?

1149
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,080
Oh no, your princess is in another castle!

1150
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,340
You're only half way there!

1151
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,880
It's the green one?

1152
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:33,260
I never specified which car 0 you have to get to.

1153
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,880
Don't you know Shinkansen have green car?

1154
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,160
Green's cars.

1155
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,160
You know...

1156
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,580
Where the premium seats are...

1157
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,980
That's literally what I talked about!

1158
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,980
The green's cars.

1159
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,020
If you're an adult, you should know that.

1160
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:07,340
You have to go through the green cars to get to the conductor's room.

1161
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,240
What he says versus what is written here is so funny.

1162
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,620
The way he has such confidence in English.

1163
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,680
But he was just like...

1164
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,600
My explanation might have been kind of bad.

1165
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,820
But here he's just like...

1166
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:27,380
Duh!

1167
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,740
The confidence they give him is so funny.

1168
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:34,900
Wow!

1169
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:35,580
What's that?

1170
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,640
Why is there spaghetti?

1171
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,320
I mean...

1172
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:39,300
Spagetti.

1173
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,520
Spagetti.

1174
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:41,840
Spagetti.

1175
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:48,010
Spagetti.

1176
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:48,630
Spagetti.

1177
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:51,170
Spagetti.

1178
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:52,370
Hahaha...

1179
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:54,570
Oh...

1180
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:58,070
Whoopsie.

1181
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:02,970
We have stopped the train due to an injury.

1182
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:06,170
A passenger has suffered shattered eardrums due to high-pitched screaming.

1183
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:06,870
I'm sorry.

1184
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:07,410
I'm sorry.

1185
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,170
By the way...

1186
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:11,850
Oh.

1187
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:14,110
Oh, sorry.

1188
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:15,090
I wasn't listening.

1189
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:15,910
On the green car.

1190
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,110
If you can't find it, just go back.

1191
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:17,850
Oh.

1192
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:17,990
Oh.

1193
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:23,090
When you find an anomaly, go forward, instead of walking back.

1194
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:27,370
Ew, what?

1195
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:28,270
What do you mean?

1196
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:29,770
There's an abacus that will come?

1197
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:30,290
What do you mean?

1198
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:32,690
One more thing.

1199
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:38,110
If you make three mistakes, the ghost will get you!

1200
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:54,530
Why is the subtitles, like, not synced with what he's saying?

1201
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:57,530
Hey, mister.

1202
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:01,670
Have you ever wondered why we're here?

1203
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:04,730
Never mind.

1204
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:08,610
What is he saying?

1205
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:09,950
He was just kind of like...

1206
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:14,390
He said basically the same thing as the... as the... the line afterward.

1207
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,510
Just to suffer.

1208
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:28,490
I don't know who did the translation, but it's just kind of weird that, like, when he talks, it's, like, a little slightly off.

1209
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:30,790
Let's just clear the game first.

1210
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,510
See you at car zero!

1211
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:37,370
Wait, so we have to go to...

1212
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,110
I wonder if my sister's awake.

1213
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:51,830
Explain... Oh, no, we don't need him to explain the rules.

1214
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:54,690
Okay.

1215
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:59,750
Wait, so, okay, if we make three mistakes, then...

1216
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,520
Turn back if no anomaly.

1217
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,260
Wait, no!

1218
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,140
Oh, yes, if there's an anomaly, we keep going.

1219
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:18,440
Okay.

1220
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,180
What?

1221
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,420
Who was that that just sat down?

1222
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,260
How do I know if that's an anomaly or not?

1223
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:24,820
I don't know.

1224
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,720
Why is she coming towards me?

1225
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:28,640
Lady!

1226
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,080
Stay back!

1227
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,700
Stay back, I tell you!

1228
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,100
Can I get through, or...

1229
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,840
Can I get a sandwich, or...

1230
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,740
Hello?

1231
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,120
Okay.

1232
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,580
It's really dark right there where the guy sat down!

1233
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,620
It's dark, it's dark, it's scary!

1234
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:00,940
She's working...

1235
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,820
She's working...

1236
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,360
I love... we love a business-oriented woman.

1237
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,860
It's really dark right there!

1238
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:08,000
I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it!

1239
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:10,560
She's gaming.

1240
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,420
She's hacking.

1241
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:16,200
I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it!

1242
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,460
Is it supposed to be this dark?

1243
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,980
Why is it so dark here?

1244
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,740
I think the lights are actually out.

1245
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,860
I think that's an anomaly, right?

1246
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,060
Anomaly is forward, so I have to go past him!

1247
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:31,800
I have to go past him!

1248
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,380
I have to go past him, Has to go past him, I have to go past him!

1249
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,960
has to go past him, I have to go past him!

1250
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,880
This is normal!

1251
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,220
It is?

1252
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,540
The first car is okay.

1253
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,000
Okay...

1254
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,900
Is it just showing me what's normal...

1255
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:49,900
What's normal?

1256
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:55,820
Are you sure that's normal?!

1257
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,340
Are you for real?

1258
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:14,700
Are you for real?

1259
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:19,860
Thank you.

1260
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,880
I thought you weren't afraid of no ghosts.

1261
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,620
I said just a little.

1262
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,880
Wait, is that the ghost that will get us if we make the mistakes?

1263
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:32,320
Help him out?

1264
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,100
I'll give you a little lift.

1265
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:38,160
Let me, here, let me just tuck my hands under your tushy.

1266
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:40,520
Lift!

1267
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:41,960
Lift!

1268
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,760
Wow, these seats are so nice.

1269
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:54,530
Okay...

1270
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:57,090
The ghost...

1271
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:59,290
I'm not making a mistake, am I?

1272
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,690
Wait, oh wait, turn back.

1273
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:05,170
If no anom... wait, so I go this way, right?

1274
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:05,670
Wait.

1275
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:06,790
Okay.

1276
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:07,410
Nevermind.

1277
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:08,770
Oh, it's confusing.

1278
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:12,130
Okay.

1279
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:18,110
I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it.

1280
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:23,770
I can't...

1281
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:32,550
I can't tell if you guys are...

1282
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,890
if you guys are trolling me or not.

1283
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:36,010
This is normal!

1284
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:43,890
Look at the Terminator up in here, for real!

1285
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,710
Then think for yourself.

1286
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:50,290
No, I'm...

1287
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:51,370
I'm trusting you guys.

1288
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:53,450
I'm trusting you guys.

1289
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,060
I'm trusting you.

1290
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:58,860
I'm trusting you.

1291
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,400
No anomaly in this area.

1292
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,020
What the hell did I miss?

1293
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:08,720
Uh-oh.

1294
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,480
Wait.

1295
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,900
I missed a shot!

1296
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:14,500
Ah!

1297
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,180
Uh-oh.

1298
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,160
Uh-oh.

1299
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,320
Uh-oh.

1300
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,980
The ghost is gonna get me.

1301
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,160
Oh.

1302
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,500
Oh.

1303
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,320
You didn't miss anything?

1304
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:30,840
Okay.

1305
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:31,400
Okay.

1306
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,820
Thank you!

1307
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,280
What do you got?

1308
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,980
What are you buying?

1309
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:39,760
Damn.

1310
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:42,740
Her...

1311
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,540
Her waist?

1312
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:48,460
Damn.

1313
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,100
Damn, girl.

1314
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,980
I'll buy whatever you're selling.

1315
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,080
Gimme them almonds.

1316
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,500
Oh, yeah!

1317
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,680
Her waist is an anomaly.

1318
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:02,580
Also, oh.

1319
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:03,920
Her toe...

1320
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,260
Her toes are really out.

1321
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,140
She's like, kind of floating.

1322
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,460
That's okay, though.

1323
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,640
She's got them...

1324
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,740
She's got them Heelys.

1325
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:24,980
Okay.

1326
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:26,340
Oh!

1327
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,860
That seems to be an anomaly!

1328
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,460
Are you actually spying on me?

1329
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:32,840
Oh, my God.

1330
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:33,740
She did hack me.

1331
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,260
She hacked me!

1332
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:35,940
For real!

1333
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,180
Why does it look blue on your screen?

1334
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:41,840
Hmm.

1335
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:46,630
Ffff...

1336
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:48,610
Right?

1337
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,340
Wait.

1338
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:57,540
Turn back if no...

1339
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:58,060
Right, right, right.

1340
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:58,300
Okay.

1341
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:00,060
Okay.

1342
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:00,540
Oh!

1343
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:02,160
What is...

1344
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,540
Ah!

1345
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:04,140
Ah!

1346
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:09,440
God, what do you want?

1347
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,780
Ha!

1348
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,100
Are you human?

1349
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:17,840
Are you human?

1350
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,480
No!

1351
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:20,600
Uh...

1352
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,420
I hope so.

1353
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:27,380
You can't trick me.

1354
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:28,940
You can't trick me.

1355
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:29,360
You're wearing a suit.

1356
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:31,480
You're wearing a suit!

1357
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,280
It's so in my ear!

1358
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,060
That's strange.

1359
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,260
That's strange.

1360
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:44,540
You don't act like the others.

1361
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:45,140
You don't act like the others.

1362
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:47,380
That much I can tell.

1363
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:49,460
That much I can tell.

1364
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:54,660
He's saying that office workers are not human.

1365
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,480
Office workers don't deserve human rights.

1366
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:08,080
How long have you been here for, Ami?

1367
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:08,720
You?

1368
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:10,260
We don't know.

1369
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,760
How long have been here for.

1370
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:14,580
It could be any of us.

1371
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,920
How long have been here for any who?

1372
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:20,820
I don't know.

1373
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:23,640
What if... Oh my gosh.

1374
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,360
Here's my game theory.

1375
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:35,940
What if this old man is the one that had the injury, the accident, and he is now dead limbo?

1376
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:38,940
Oh my gosh.

1377
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,760
I don't know.

1378
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:47,420
Did you meet anyone in the train?

1379
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,960
A boy?

1380
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:54,700
That's good.

1381
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,120
From my observation.

1382
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:07,380
And from my 84 years of experience.

1383
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,240
Seems like most people here are not actual humans.

1384
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,320
This guy is so close.

1385
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:19,700
This is like...

1386
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,600
I don't know how actual old people are, man.

1387
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,560
He's giving me that lead stare.

1388
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:25,480
He's just like, come on.

1389
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,780
The lead paint stare, please, sir.

1390
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,000
They never respond when I talk to them.

1391
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:38,420
They're almost like...

1392
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:39,340
Robots.

1393
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,500
I know a human when I see one.

1394
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:51,500
So my conclusion is...

1395
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:58,620
Never trust the men in suits.

1396
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:01,460
That lady, she was also wearing a suit.

1397
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,460
Now if you'll let me...

1398
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,300
I'm tired.

1399
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,540
Let me sleep.

1400
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:15,660
Let me just sleep.

1401
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:18,520
He's like acting like we're the men in black or something.

1402
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:22,500
Before I...

1403
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:23,740
Oh.

1404
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,960
Before you what, sir?

1405
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:27,500
Oh!

1406
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:28,660
Wait.

1407
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,100
What happened to his face?

1408
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:31,240
Sir?

1409
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:32,780
Are you okay?

1410
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:33,740
Oh.

1411
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,040
Oh.

1412
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:37,780
Nah, he's just asleep.

1413
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:46,060
I think we're okay.

1414
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:46,160
Okay.

1415
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,720
It does say that there's no anomalies in this area.

1416
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:55,020
So for him to be in this area means he truly is not an anomaly.

1417
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,420
I'm gonna grab a cough drop real quick.

1418
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,560
So sorry if you hear it.

1419
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:12,920
I think I need one because of how spooked I'm getting.

1420
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:15,180
Wait.

1421
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:16,680
Are any of these open?

1422
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:17,680
Oh, yes, this one is.

1423
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:18,760
Okay.

1424
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,240
What flavor is it?

1425
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,260
It's just...

1426
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:27,320
It's not really any flavor.

1427
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:32,820
It's just menthol.

1428
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:33,940
Woo!

1429
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:35,600
Cough drop ASMR.

1430
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:39,560
Do you like that?

1431
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:44,300
Do you like hearing me open my bag and have like a little baggie of cough drops?

1432
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:45,520
Like...

1433
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,380
Or rather the baggie has other bags of cough drops in it.

1434
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,020
And then also some packets of yuzu and...

1435
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:56,680
It's yuzu...

1436
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:57,000
Wait.

1437
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:57,720
Am I going the right way?

1438
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:57,880
Yeah.

1439
01:05:59,440 --> 01:05:59,800
Wait.

1440
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:00,660
Am I going the right way?

1441
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:01,740
Yeah.

1442
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:02,420
I came from...

1443
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,100
Okay.

1444
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:04,020
Yeah.

1445
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:04,580
Yeah.

1446
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,200
Yeah.

1447
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:08,740
Oh, God.

1448
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,640
I don't like the way it sits every time.

1449
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:14,280
Oh, God.

1450
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:17,420
This is some kind of...

1451
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,060
You can use the phone?

1452
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:21,820
You can?

1453
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,120
Oh, I shouldn't turn back though.

1454
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:27,560
What's that sound?

1455
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:30,860
Okay.

1456
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:34,820
She's doing regular business things on her blue screen.

1457
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,140
What if I block you?

1458
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:38,380
Oh.

1459
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:41,080
Okay.

1460
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:42,180
Wow.

1461
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:43,540
Oh.

1462
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,460
I was gonna say.

1463
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,100
This is something.

1464
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:46,920
I'm customer service.

1465
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,400
I don't even have to use my feet.

1466
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:52,100
This is the Shinkansen Zero headed to Tokyo.

1467
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,740
Yeah, unstoppable force.

1468
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:58,880
For real.

1469
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,600
I don't like this guy.

1470
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:07,880
I don't like him.

1471
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:08,720
I don't like him.

1472
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:09,460
I don't like him.

1473
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,580
Turn around.

1474
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,420
Turn around.

1475
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:22,720
Oh my god.

1476
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,480
I don't like this part at all.

1477
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:25,900
I don't like this part at all.

1478
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,020
I don't like this part at all.

1479
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,380
I don't like this part at all.

1480
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,880
Chilla's Art heard that song and took it personally.

1481
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,280
All these seats have faces on them.

1482
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:11,980
They kind of look like... No they don't.

1483
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,020
What faces?

1484
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:23,120
I don't see anything in the... What is the bar?

1485
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:26,040
Maybe it's just a reflection of the light.

1486
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:31,100
Oh, it's so... Wait.

1487
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,120
Okay, that's also a reflection.

1488
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,800
I thought I saw like someone leaning out from a seat.

1489
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:39,320
I think this is normal.

1490
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:47,370
This seems pretty normal.

1491
01:08:49,410 --> 01:08:51,630
The back of the seat looks like a robot face.

1492
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:53,510
Oh, it does kind of look like a robot face.

1493
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:54,150
Yeah, I see that.

1494
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,510
Okay, so I have to run back.

1495
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:03,830
Wait.

1496
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:05,710
What's that light right there?

1497
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:11,210
Is this usually on?

1498
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:12,570
Wait.

1499
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:14,090
Is this in an... Wait.

1500
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:18,470
These are... These are... These are...

1501
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:20,370
Seat lights?

1502
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:21,110
Wow.

1503
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:22,610
That's normal?

1504
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:23,150
Okay.

1505
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:26,530
Okay.

1506
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:30,990
Turn back if no anomaly.

1507
01:09:30,990 --> 01:09:32,350
So we're turning back.

1508
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:34,370
Okay.

1509
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:37,550
What kind of sandwich is this?

1510
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:38,210
Chicken.

1511
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:39,470
Green.

1512
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:42,830
What is chicken and green?

1513
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,200
Sea lantern blocks.

1514
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,960
Didn't the lady have a blue screen on her laptop?

1515
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:52,340
She did!

1516
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:55,480
That's why we're good.

1517
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:56,960
Because it's a blue screen.

1518
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,020
She's literally doing nothing.

1519
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:00,500
Ma'am?

1520
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:01,820
Ma'am?

1521
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:02,920
Who are you typing to?

1522
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:07,640
She's got... She's got, like, the special vision.

1523
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:08,600
Oh my gosh.

1524
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,820
She's got on Google Glass.

1525
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,160
We just can't see it.

1526
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:17,420
And it's... That's why she's typing actually.

1527
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,260
Oh, she's got them Apple goggles.

1528
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,900
Hope I didn't just make a mistake.

1529
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:32,520
25 left.

1530
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,340
25 left.

1531
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,220
You know what's funnier than 25?

1532
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:40,460
26.

1533
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,600
25 left.

1534
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:54,300
No one's in here though, right?

1535
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:55,180
Wait.

1536
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,240
Okay.

1537
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:02,670
Okay!

1538
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:03,270
Good!

1539
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:03,530
Arigatou!

1540
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:04,150
Arigatou!

1541
01:11:04,150 --> 01:11:04,410
Wah!

1542
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:04,510
Wah!

1543
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:07,070
Thank you for the Akadono!

1544
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:08,690
Thank you so much!

1545
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:15,990
Just wanna say that I appreciate you and to not let the rather negative messages you've been receiving get to you.

1546
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:18,610
For every bad message, there are 100 of us that love and support you.

1547
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:19,310
Anyway, best of luck.

1548
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:20,290
You're doing great.

1549
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:21,210
Thank you so much!

1550
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:21,910
Thank you.

1551
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:23,970
Appreciate it so much.

1552
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:26,590
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1553
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:31,370
Okay, so far so good.

1554
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:36,190
Ma'am, we'll let you pass.

1555
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:39,510
You shall pass.

1556
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:42,510
Wait a second.

1557
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:43,750
Sticks?

1558
01:11:45,130 --> 01:11:47,670
You weren't selling sticks before, were you?

1559
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:49,410
Actually, I think she was.

1560
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:51,010
I can't remember though.

1561
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:54,010
I can't remember actually.

1562
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:55,510
Chicken and green...

1563
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:56,850
I feel like if it's...

1564
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:00,350
That looks...

1565
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:02,170
Down there, that looks like a tomato...

1566
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:03,290
Tomato.

1567
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:04,350
Tamago.

1568
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:07,690
An eggy sandwich.

1569
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:12,430
I didn't just say tomato for no reason.

1570
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:14,130
It's because I was thinking tamago.

1571
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:15,510
But...

1572
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:20,330
Oh man.

1573
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:21,790
That's how my brain works.

1574
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:22,910
For real, you guys.

1575
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:27,110
My brain can be quite confusing.

1576
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,090
Oh, gosh lady.

1577
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:31,830
Your dumpy is making it hard to pass.

1578
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:34,230
Tomato.

1579
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:35,830
Tamago.

1580
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:42,790
Gosh.

1581
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:54,260
I don't like you.

1582
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,540
Wait, didn't he say don't trust the people in suits?

1583
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:01,040
But they're not wearing a suit.

1584
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:06,660
So...

1585
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,340
This shinkansen...

1586
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,200
Zero headed to Tokyo.

1587
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:14,860
It looks like Orochimaru.

1588
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:15,920
It does, actually.

1589
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,080
Anime Oro...

1590
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:19,440
Oh wait.

1591
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:21,180
Anime Orochimaru.

1592
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,680
No, Anime Terminator is what I was thinking.

1593
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,320
Wait, this one looks too normal too.

1594
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:30,980
Is this combat- Is it working?

1595
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:31,880
No.

1596
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:32,580
Hahaha.

1597
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,560
Ah, la la la la la...

1598
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:38,200
La la la la la la la la la la...

1599
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:41,390
La la la la la...

1600
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:45,730
I'm afraid that I'm going to miss something because it's in the dark area and I don't want to go over there.

1601
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:48,270
I'm afraid of the dark you got.

1602
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:48,550
Wait.

1603
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:54,390
Did the cushions always look like this or am I going crazy?

1604
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:05,070
Did the cushions... they did?

1605
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:05,610
Okay.

1606
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:08,450
No and yes.

1607
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:10,730
Why are you like this?

1608
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:14,550
Why are you like this?

1609
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:18,290
Is it normal then?

1610
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:19,510
Are we normal?

1611
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:21,610
Is everything normal?

1612
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:24,330
Nothing is normal about this.

1613
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:25,090
What is it normal?

1614
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:26,650
Oh gosh!

1615
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,950
My throat is actually starting to hurt.

1616
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:34,510
I need to stop screaming.

1617
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:38,290
Mister!

1618
01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:39,610
Mister!

1619
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,520
Why is your eye glowing?

1620
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:54,960
Thank you!

1621
01:14:57,020 --> 01:15:02,960
I like to think that when the You're a simp sound plays, it's you guys calling me a simp.

1622
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,480
Which is quite honestly accurate so...

1623
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,960
Looks good to me, Kappa.

1624
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:10,840
Thank you, thank you.

1625
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:11,020
Thank you.

1626
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:26,250
That... I don't believe that there are two trains in a row that are normal.

1627
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:28,150
That's right.

1628
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:28,910
Right?

1629
01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:30,990
Like that doesn't sound good.

1630
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:33,590
I'm being serious here?

1631
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:33,770
Go.

1632
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:34,830
I know you can make it.

1633
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:35,470
Get outta here.

1634
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:37,090
Everyone's waiting for you.

1635
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,940
She didn't change the bright blue desktop wallpaper.

1636
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,480
I didn't either.

1637
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:50,560
Great job, Mer.

1638
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,040
I don't see anything in the reflections.

1639
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,000
I think we're good.

1640
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:10,820
I think we're good.

1641
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,440
Oh no, please, no mistake.

1642
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,340
I'm afraid of the ghost!

1643
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,340
I'm afraid of the ghost!

1644
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:17,440
I'm afraid of the ghost!

1645
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:21,780
There can only be one ghost here, okay?

1646
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,620
Where did Grandpa go?

1647
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:29,760
25

1648
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:37,630
Oh my gosh, there actually was nothing.

1649
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:40,210
Headed to Tokyo.

1650
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:46,130
25, 25, 25, back home.

1651
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:48,790
25 off this train.

1652
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:52,650
Need you, get out of here.

1653
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:59,110
Is that just the lighting or what is, what is that?

1654
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:04,130
Is that a, what is that?

1655
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:07,230
Is that an anomaly?

1656
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:10,290
Is that a person, what is that?

1657
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:11,430
Invisible man?

1658
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,200
I have to go past it!

1659
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:22,920
Invisible man anomaly?

1660
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,960
Well, he's not doing a very good job.

1661
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:26,220
I noticed him immediately.

1662
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:30,880
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.

1663
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,660
What did I just hear?

1664
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:39,760
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, there's a man in my seat.

1665
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,220
Please, please, there's a man in my...

1666
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:44,800
Oh my gosh, that scared me.

1667
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:45,700
I thought she responded.

1668
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:53,760
One time, okay, so...

1669
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:56,580
I once...

1670
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:03,060
Okay, so one time I flew business class back from Japan.

1671
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:09,960
It was the only time, it's the only time I've ever flown business class on a flight.

1672
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:15,520
And I only did it on the way back home because doing both ways would have been so expensive, right?

1673
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,100
Whoa, fancy, I know.

1674
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,860
It was after a work trip, so...

1675
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:24,380
I was like, you know what, I am gonna get the business class cause I'm...

1676
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:27,100
I've been working this whole time and I'm very tired.

1677
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:30,120
I just really wanted to, like, feel good on the plane.

1678
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:36,180
And I sat down in my little cubicle.

1679
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,940
And also I was just like, this probably will be the only chance I get at business class.

1680
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:44,340
Cause usually they're, like, full.

1681
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,060
Like, I just like to check anyway, even though I'm not gonna get it.

1682
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,460
But usually all the seats are taken.

1683
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,860
But for this flight, they weren't.

1684
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,380
And so I was just like, you know...

1685
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,680
Slash the price in half.

1686
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:00,740
And my old company had taken care of the initial price.

1687
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:08,540
So it almost felt like I was paying for just a regular ticket to Japan anyway.

1688
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:09,480
So I was like, okay.

1689
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:12,060
So, I know.

1690
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:13,380
It's like, sounds like copium.

1691
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:17,240
But I really had to, like, do some mental gymnastics to get myself to buy this thing.

1692
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,220
So, girl math.

1693
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:23,100
Yeah, actually.

1694
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,120
The old company being heaven.

1695
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:28,440
Yes.

1696
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:29,180
Yes.

1697
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:30,380
But anyway.

1698
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:32,680
So I...

1699
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:39,040
I sat down in my little cubicle.

1700
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:39,880
And I'm like, okay.

1701
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:40,680
This is so...

1702
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:41,420
Oh my gosh.

1703
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:42,700
Like, my first...

1704
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:43,860
This is a first time experience.

1705
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:44,960
This is so crazy.

1706
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:48,200
And I lean back in my seat.

1707
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:53,120
And to my right is a man's foot.

1708
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:59,680
The guy behind me, like, put his feet up over the cubicle.

1709
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:03,320
So that his feet were directly in my face.

1710
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:04,920
And I was like, this is...

1711
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,220
I did not spend this money.

1712
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,440
Well, like, you know.

1713
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:12,760
But I did...

1714
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:13,040
I...

1715
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:14,140
I...

1716
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:14,820
I am in...

1717
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:16,420
I am in the business class.

1718
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,380
I do not deserve this disrespect.

1719
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:21,100
So I called over a flight attendant.

1720
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:23,200
And I was like, I know we haven't taken off yet.

1721
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,440
But can you tell him to, like, put his feet down?

1722
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:31,380
Also, I was like, the beds go down.

1723
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:33,760
Like, there's so much foot space down there.

1724
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:36,620
Why don't you just lay down if you want to extend your feet like that?

1725
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:39,400
Did you tell him off?

1726
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,540
No, because I'm very non-confrontational.

1727
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:43,820
But I told the...

1728
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:45,440
I told the flight attendant.

1729
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:48,100
I was like, could you please tell him to, like, put his feet down?

1730
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,080
They're in my face.

1731
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:50,440
And she goes to him.

1732
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:53,440
Thank you so much!

1733
01:20:56,300 --> 01:21:01,760
She goes to him and says, the girl in front of you complained.

1734
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:06,200
Could you please put your feet down?

1735
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,880
And I was like, now you're gonna...

1736
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,300
Now you put a target on my back.

1737
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:13,020
You couldn't just say, hi, sir.

1738
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:14,240
We're about to take off.

1739
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,920
Could you please lower your feet?

1740
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:17,580
Like, anything like that?

1741
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:18,120
No!

1742
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:19,700
Yeah, she put me on blast!

1743
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:21,680
I was so...

1744
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,960
I was like...

1745
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:26,140
I thought, this is gonna be the worst trip ever.

1746
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,860
I should have never paid for it.

1747
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:32,860
Anyway, this invisible man, for some reason, reminded me of that.

1748
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:34,660
Okay.

1749
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,060
We just gotta run forward.

1750
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,060
We just gotta run forward.

1751
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:37,920
We just gotta run.

1752
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:38,320
Run.

1753
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:38,760
Run.

1754
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:41,220
He's probably just gonna stay there.

1755
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:41,740
He's...

1756
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:42,180
He's...

1757
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:43,540
He's in his own lane.

1758
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:44,180
He's...

1759
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:46,860
He's living his invisible life.

1760
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,060
He doesn't even want to be seen.

1761
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:49,280
He doesn't even want to be seen.

1762
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,820
So he wouldn't chase after me because he doesn't want us to notice him.

1763
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:56,860
Anyways.

1764
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:02,420
Maybe I should have publicly shamed that man.

1765
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:04,120
Been like, your feet are stinky!

1766
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,640
and they're in my FACE!

1767
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,360
Okay.

1768
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:11,200
Moisturized.

1769
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,400
And unbothered.

1770
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,520
I hope he's not moisturized.

1771
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:18,400
Okay, here we go.

1772
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:18,620
Sorry.

1773
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:19,780
I know I'm like... stalling.

1774
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:20,780
I'm scared.

1775
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:21,300
I'm scared.

1776
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:21,760
I'm scared.

1777
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:22,240
I'm scared.

1778
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:22,760
I'm scared.

1779
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:26,860
I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared...

1780
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:33,290
I'm scared.

1781
01:22:35,770 --> 01:22:36,230
I'm scared.

1782
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:36,810
I'm scared.

1783
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:37,890
Confirmed that it was an invisible man.

1784
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:39,810
But that thing has never been there before, so...

1785
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:45,050
Oh my god, it's beautiful!

1786
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:46,510
Wait, there's nobody here though.

1787
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:52,890
Oh, that's my feet.

1788
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:54,570
I was like, I like this one.

1789
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:57,090
Wait, we have to continue on through this.

1790
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:58,810
I was gonna turn around, but...

1791
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:02,830
We just gotta... wait, is that a person up there?

1792
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:05,390
No, that's a... wait, that's a tree.

1793
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:10,910
No anomalies, just rad.

1794
01:23:11,130 --> 01:23:11,690
Yeah.

1795
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:15,390
Well, at least it was easy to tell.

1796
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:17,710
I'm still kind of scared though.

1797
01:23:17,810 --> 01:23:22,430
What if a lion pops out at me or something?

1798
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:24,170
I don't know.

1799
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:25,190
Okay, run!

1800
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:30,510
Hey, it's a kid!

1801
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:33,070
Hey mister.

1802
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:35,350
Do you think we can go back alive?

1803
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:38,330
Do you think we'll ever get out of here alive?

1804
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:41,670
Think about your sister.

1805
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:50,820
Well, I'm gonna keep doing my job.

1806
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:53,040
Maybe you should consider doing yours, okay?

1807
01:23:58,220 --> 01:23:58,660
Wow.

1808
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,840
That is a trunk.

1809
01:24:10,030 --> 01:24:10,950
Anybody in here?

1810
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:14,150
I was wondering if we were gonna see him again.

1811
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:15,850
I thought he would be, like, in the bathroom.

1812
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:17,450
25?

1813
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:18,850
Oh, 24.

1814
01:24:20,150 --> 01:24:22,750
It's a good thing that I... that I...

1815
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:23,630
Okay.

1816
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:27,290
It's a good thing I clicked on it because I really thought it was 25.

1817
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:32,670
Can we go back to the pretty car, please?

1818
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:36,430
Can we go back to the nice car?

1819
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:50,950
Well, one thing I can be... I can feel safe about is that nothing will come running from that direction because we have to go forward.

1820
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:55,450
Shouldn't it be 23?

1821
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:57,230
Wait, what do you mean?

1822
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:01,550
24 is not as funny as 15.

1823
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:03,190
Number 15.

1824
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:05,630
Tomato sandwich.

1825
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:09,030
Okay, nothing.

1826
01:25:10,150 --> 01:25:11,830
Oh, I thought she was about to look at me.

1827
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:16,350
Nothing in the... reflections that I can see.

1828
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:17,890
Hello?

1829
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:22,570
I mean, I can see the... I can see the mountains from here, though.

1830
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:25,150
Nothing.

1831
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:27,710
Nothing here.

1832
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:37,810
I can't tell if it's the game or not.

1833
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:45,140
Mister,

1834
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:55,650
you need some help?

1835
01:25:56,370 --> 01:25:56,970
Thank you.

1836
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:01,470
Glad to have you back, boss.

1837
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:07,010
Any chance you'll play Kojima's masterpiece, Death Stranding, in its full glory on stream?

1838
01:26:07,890 --> 01:26:09,290
I would like to.

1839
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:13,110
Just because I want to get ready for Death Stranding 2.

1840
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:17,070
Why does it feel darker than before?

1841
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:21,230
Why does it feel darker than before, you guys?

1842
01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:21,830
You guys?

1843
01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:30,570
I know it's not, but I think it... I don't know.

1844
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:32,830
I don't know.

1845
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:33,970
I don't know.

1846
01:26:33,970 --> 01:26:34,230
I don't know.

1847
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:38,690
I don't know.

1848
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:40,210
He's not balding.

1849
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:42,070
An anomaly.

1850
01:26:42,190 --> 01:26:43,070
He has like, luscious.

1851
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:43,870
Beautiful hair.

1852
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:48,690
He looks fine.

1853
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:51,990
He's just a jolly guy.

1854
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:54,610
He's fine.

1855
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:56,030
He's handsome.

1856
01:26:56,190 --> 01:26:57,750
Don't worry about it.

1857
01:26:57,870 --> 01:26:59,410
I'm on your side, mister.

1858
01:27:00,610 --> 01:27:03,030
I'm not gonna let these people bully you.

1859
01:27:04,210 --> 01:27:05,390
Headed to Tokyo?

1860
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:10,450
Am I just getting really lucky with these or what?

1861
01:27:10,450 --> 01:27:14,310
Wait, let me make sure there's no one sitting in these seats.

1862
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:19,670
He's got a suit on.

1863
01:27:19,950 --> 01:27:21,150
Yeah, we can't trust him.

1864
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:24,510
But that doesn't mean... you know...

1865
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:37,540
Okay, I'm gonna move forward, but I'm gonna let you guys decide, okay?

1866
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:41,700
You guys tell me if there's...

1867
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,360
Anything, okay?

1868
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:46,780
I'm too scared.

1869
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:49,560
That man is my spirit animal.

1870
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:50,600
I'm also bald.

1871
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:52,320
He's not bald.

1872
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:53,120
He's balding.

1873
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:57,680
I'm scared.

1874
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:58,520
I'm scared.

1875
01:27:58,680 --> 01:27:59,620
I'm scared.

1876
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:01,160
I'm scared.

1877
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:01,840
I'm scared.

1878
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:02,200
I'm scared.

1879
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:42,360
Okay, forward.

1880
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:42,880
Forward.

1881
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:43,260
Forward.

1882
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:45,860
Okay, it's still there.

1883
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:46,460
It's still there.

1884
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:47,860
Okay, thank you guys.

1885
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:48,280
Thank you.

1886
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:49,800
You really saved me.

1887
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:54,120
Okay.

1888
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:56,560
Turn back if no anomaly.

1889
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:57,020
Okay.

1890
01:28:58,440 --> 01:28:58,920
Okay.

1891
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:01,280
Good job.

1892
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,420
Good job, team.

1893
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:03,420
Good job.

1894
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:04,640
What would I do without you guys?

1895
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,220
Oh, God, please.

1896
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,180
I need a break.

1897
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:12,440
I just...

1898
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:15,700
Oh, man.

1899
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:17,700
Okay, here we go.

1900
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:20,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1901
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:28,640
Car 1.

1902
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:34,280
This is Shinkansen 0.

1903
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,440
Headed to Tokyo.

1904
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:38,020
Okay.

1905
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:41,930
Good work, boss.

1906
01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:43,950
No, that was on you guys.

1907
01:29:44,530 --> 01:29:46,010
That was all you.

1908
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:49,890
Oh, she scared me.

1909
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:50,010
She scared me.

1910
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:52,970
Mmhmmmm.

1911
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:02,190
She's still typey-top.

1912
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:05,050
Okay.

1913
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:07,890
No one else in these seats.

1914
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:12,230
Okay.

1915
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:13,370
Phew.

1916
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:17,710
What are you working on?

1917
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:23,810
She's writing fanfiction...probably.

1918
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:26,910
I think that's just the game.

1919
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:30,070
I think that's just the game.

1920
01:30:30,210 --> 01:30:30,430
Okay.

1921
01:30:47,660 --> 01:30:50,740
Alright guys...so far so good.

1922
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:54,900
The other one...the other one could have been easy to miss though.

1923
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:56,240
You know?

1924
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:01,120
Had I...had I not gone back so...

1925
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:06,560
This train is so chill.

1926
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:08,040
You think this is chill?

1927
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,580
Are you feeling really relaxed right now?

1928
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,500
Are you having a good time?

1929
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:13,740
I'm so happy for you.

1930
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:17,600
You think this is a nice, chill little run here?

1931
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:18,080
Hmm?

1932
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:18,720
Yeah?

1933
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:19,620
Yeah?

1934
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:21,120
Oh god.

1935
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,100
Oh god.

1936
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,580
Okay mister...

1937
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:30,340
Wait, I don't see anything for real though.

1938
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:34,960
Chilla.

1939
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:39,220
Oh gosh.

1940
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:40,920
I feel so stressed.

1941
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:45,420
I feel very intense.

1942
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:50,900
I feel like I need...like a massage after this or something.

1943
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:53,740
She's so tall too.

1944
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:54,920
How...how...

1945
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,440
How short are we?

1946
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,100
It's okay though.

1947
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:01,700
I prefer tall women, you know?

1948
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:03,500
It's okay.

1949
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:05,500
Um...

1950
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:08,620
Ghost massage.

1951
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:09,900
Yeah.

1952
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:17,220
Put my...you know, by the time I'm done I'm gonna be like a little ghost orb because I'm gonna be so relaxed.

1953
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:18,020
I'm gonna be...

1954
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:19,860
They're gonna knead me into a ball.

1955
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:27,840
The ball.

1956
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:34,320
You guys think it's okay?

1957
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:38,840
I didn't see anything...

1958
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:43,540
Gosh.

1959
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:44,800
Every time it does that.

1960
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:48,680
That's...that's part of the game.

1961
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:50,120
That's...that's not like an...

1962
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:53,460
I think it would be more obvious if it were like a flickering light, you know?

1963
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:55,460
Looks okay to me.

1964
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:02,820
Turn back if no anomaly.

1965
01:33:06,110 --> 01:33:07,790
I think there's no anomaly.

1966
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:10,150
What do you think, ma'am?

1967
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:14,450
Check the old man.

1968
01:33:24,020 --> 01:33:26,560
There's no face in his bald spot.

1969
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:29,060
He looks the same as before.

1970
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,440
He looks pretty much the same.

1971
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:39,860
He is so tall also.

1972
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:41,900
Maybe I'm the child.

1973
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:44,340
Okay.

1974
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:48,360
Don't look at me.

1975
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:48,740
Don't look at me.

1976
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:49,300
Don't look at me.

1977
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:50,000
Don't look at me.

1978
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:52,720
Okay.

1979
01:34:00,630 --> 01:34:01,430
Here goes nothing.

1980
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:03,690
24.

1981
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:07,250
22.

1982
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:13,900
22?

1983
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:17,900
The numbers.

1984
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:19,660
What do they mean?

1985
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:20,800
What do they mean?

1986
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:24,520
Zero!

1987
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:27,020
Oh my gosh, nice.

1988
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:29,300
Nice, nice, nice.

1989
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:30,140
Good job, everybody.

1990
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:31,620
Good job, team.

1991
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:32,400
Good job, team.

1992
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:34,800
Okay.

1993
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:37,220
So far...

1994
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:39,960
So far, so good.

1995
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:44,900
He's always said 22.

1996
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:45,580
What do you mean?

1997
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:46,680
No, I know.

1998
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:48,220
Oh, wait.

1999
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:50,400
He did say 25 before.

2000
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:52,040
Because I said...

2001
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:52,300
Good luck.

2002
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:53,420
Need you...

2003
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:54,100
Go...

2004
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:55,420
Need you go off the train.

2005
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:55,840
Yeah.

2006
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,700
He did say 25 before.

2007
01:34:58,880 --> 01:34:59,480
I'm not crazy.

2008
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,040
I'm not crazy.

2009
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:03,880
They put me in a room.

2010
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,480
A room full of rats.

2011
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:06,740
The rats made me crazy.

2012
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:08,640
I was crazy once.

2013
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,320
They put me in a room.

2014
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:11,360
A room full of sticks.

2015
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:12,780
The sticks made me crazy.

2016
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:17,420
But we did skip 23.

2017
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:17,980
Yeah.

2018
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,420
Unless I just forgot to...

2019
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:20,760
Yeah.

2020
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:22,020
Yeah.

2021
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:24,040
I forgot to...

2022
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:24,440
Your cue.

2023
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:26,100
Crazy.

2024
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:26,780
Cue...

2025
01:35:26,780 --> 01:35:28,060
Stop it.

2026
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:34,340
Unless I forgot to check the telephone at that point.

2027
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:34,700
Okay.

2028
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:43,320
Okay.

2029
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,240
Okay.

2030
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:48,400
Okay.

2031
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:50,120
Okay.

2032
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:50,900
Okay.

2033
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:53,660
Okay.

2034
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:55,200
Where's rule 7?

2035
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:57,560
Rule 7 is...

2036
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,560
what you imagine it to be.

2037
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:03,920
Rule 7 is...

2038
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:05,800
you know, what you make of it.

2039
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:21,780
Ghost of rule 7.

2040
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:27,440
So far, nothing in the windows.

2041
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:28,620
Nothing in the seats.

2042
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:33,280
Ghost in the streets.

2043
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:34,600
Ghost in the sheets.

2044
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:35,880
Ghost in the seats.

2045
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:40,540
That ghost...

2046
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:43,880
What was that sound?

2047
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:45,880
I don't know.

2048
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,060
You'd think I would get used to it, but I'm not!

2049
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:54,000
I just think at some point they're gonna grab me.

2050
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:59,680
No way, there's no anomaly on this one either.

2051
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:03,520
Is that common for people who have watched other people play this game?

2052
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,280
That there's like, typically...

2053
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:12,500
more anomaly-less trains than anomaly-filled trains?

2054
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:17,760
No, your luck is ridiculous?

2055
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:21,600
Well, if it grabs you, it'd be an anomaly.

2056
01:37:22,180 --> 01:37:23,140
So true!

2057
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:28,240
You're cute today too.

2058
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,200
No, no, no.

2059
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,760
No, no, no.

2060
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:35,780
Okay.

2061
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:38,880
This is Shinkansen Zero.

2062
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,120
Headed to Tokyo.

2063
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,040
Tokyo calling.

2064
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:45,760
Tokyo calling.

2065
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:48,900
Tokyo calling.

2066
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:50,760
Tokyo calling.

2067
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:52,920
Um...

2068
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:56,920
Okay.

2069
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:58,880
Thank you, thank you.

2070
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,400
If no anomaly turned back...

2071
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:05,180
It would really suck since we're at train zero!

2072
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:07,600
Right?

2073
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:08,420
Right, lady?

2074
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,560
She's kinda double-jointed, just like me.

2075
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,020
Rule 7 is rule 30...

2076
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:16,300
No!

2077
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,120
That's not an anomaly, right?

2078
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:22,140
That's just a...

2079
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:24,140
I think that's just how...

2080
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:26,180
She looks.

2081
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:30,380
Her face is a bit weird.

2082
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:37,740
Actually, this is maybe the most normal faces I've ever seen in Chilla's Art Game.

2083
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:39,980
Like, ever.

2084
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:41,820
Ever, ever, ever, ever.

2085
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:48,400
I think this is actually the most normal faces I've ever seen in a Chilla's Art Game.

2086
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:51,740
They even have like...

2087
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:54,040
She has a little bit of definition.

2088
01:38:54,040 --> 01:39:03,240
Like, I think in the past they've just been like PNGs pasted on top of a... of a... of a... of a egg.

2089
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:05,140
And that was their face.

2090
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:07,440
Yeah, true, they're improving.

2091
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,400
Yeah, yeah, she doesn't look so bad.

2092
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:10,740
Like creepy, yes.

2093
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:13,940
And also she's got like these weirdo pixelated shadows.

2094
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,860
But that's fine, that's fine.

2095
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:18,100
What's her skincare routine?

2096
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:19,780
For real?

2097
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:21,200
Okay.

2098
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:24,160
I think... I think...

2099
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:26,240
Alright guys, what's the consensus?

2100
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:26,940
Do we...

2101
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:29,120
Do we say there's no anomaly?

2102
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:31,340
I don't see anything.

2103
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:34,800
We went through every seat?

2104
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,660
I truly didn't see anything.

2105
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:40,380
I think it's good.

2106
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,360
All clear?

2107
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:44,080
I'd say there's none.

2108
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:47,100
Okay.

2109
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:57,910
Still nothing in there.

2110
01:39:59,190 --> 01:39:59,830
Alrighty.

2111
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:08,690
Conductor's room!

2112
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:12,750
Nice.

2113
01:40:13,950 --> 01:40:15,070
Good job everybody.

2114
01:40:16,230 --> 01:40:17,370
Wait, so...

2115
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:19,290
How does this one work?

2116
01:40:21,230 --> 01:40:23,410
I still go back if there's an anomaly?

2117
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:24,150
Or...

2118
01:40:29,370 --> 01:40:30,830
Or do I just go forward?

2119
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:31,150
Or do I just go forward?

2120
01:40:32,370 --> 01:40:34,130
Oh gosh, you scared me again.

2121
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:38,980
Just go forward now.

2122
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:40,680
Oh, so there is no anomaly.

2123
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:42,640
Just go to the end?

2124
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,040
Just go forward?

2125
01:40:48,570 --> 01:40:49,330
Oh madam.

2126
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:52,350
I love to see you walk away.

2127
01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:53,770
I love to see you walk away.

2128
01:40:53,770 --> 01:40:54,790
Headed to...

2129
01:40:55,410 --> 01:40:55,690
Tokyo.

2130
01:40:56,690 --> 01:40:58,330
So there's no anomalies here?

2131
01:40:58,930 --> 01:40:59,890
I can just go?

2132
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:03,830
Even with her?

2133
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:04,390
Even with her?

2134
01:41:05,410 --> 01:41:06,110
With him?

2135
01:41:06,570 --> 01:41:07,410
With him?

2136
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:14,950
Ghost on bottom left.

2137
01:41:18,410 --> 01:41:20,670
I think I'm gonna run for it.

2138
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:48,740
Conductor's room.

2139
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,200
I can't tell if I...

2140
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:56,060
I believe you guys.

2141
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:57,840
I'm just gonna do a quick sweep.

2142
01:41:58,480 --> 01:41:59,000
Just...

2143
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:01,400
A quick check.

2144
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:03,220
Just in case.

2145
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:05,320
Just in case.

2146
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:07,760
Just in case.

2147
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:09,240
Just in case.

2148
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:12,260
Just go forward?

2149
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:13,060
Okay, fine.

2150
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:13,880
Fine.

2151
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:14,360
Fine.

2152
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:17,180
Fine.

2153
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:17,880
Fine.

2154
01:42:18,020 --> 01:42:18,380
Fine.

2155
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:18,560
Fine.

2156
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:18,660
Fine.

2157
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:19,280
Fine.

2158
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:28,690
Doesn't work.

2159
01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:30,070
Wait, what's over here?

2160
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:33,390
It's...

2161
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:35,950
It's a PNG.

2162
01:42:37,810 --> 01:42:39,410
I'm putting a break...

2163
01:42:39,410 --> 01:42:40,870
I'm putting a stop to this...

2164
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:41,890
Crazy train.

2165
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:49,290
Uh oh.

2166
01:43:11,630 --> 01:43:13,310
Why am I so small?

2167
01:43:13,830 --> 01:43:14,090
Why am I so small?

2168
01:43:20,390 --> 01:43:23,350
Wait, we can go out or we can go through here?

2169
01:43:23,670 --> 01:43:23,710
Wait, we can go out or we can go through here?

2170
01:43:23,710 --> 01:43:24,190
Oh!

2171
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:35,080
Ending 1!

2172
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:36,320
Get off the train!

2173
01:43:42,610 --> 01:43:44,110
Song is safe to use on Youtube.

2174
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:47,490
That...

2175
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:49,910
That...

2176
01:43:51,390 --> 01:43:52,210
What song?

2177
01:43:52,610 --> 01:43:53,130
What song?

2178
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:00,560
What song?

2179
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:02,620
Wait, so...

2180
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:04,660
What's the other ending?

2181
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:06,120
Wait, what even happened?

2182
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,220
Nothing even happened.

2183
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:08,960
Huh?

2184
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:15,280
Uh...

2185
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:20,600
I... Huh?

2186
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:22,220
What about the kid?

2187
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:30,340
This is the normal end.

2188
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:31,820
Oh, wait.

2189
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:32,960
I got the bad end?

2190
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:36,870
Okay.

2191
01:44:38,110 --> 01:44:38,550
Interesting.

2192
01:44:39,470 --> 01:44:40,350
So there's...

2193
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:43,390
Wouldn't the bad end be dying?

2194
01:44:43,690 --> 01:44:44,690
To the ghost?

2195
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:49,770
I do kind of want to see what happens if you mess up three times, but...

2196
01:44:52,070 --> 01:44:52,510
Yay!

2197
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:55,430
My favorite song.

2198
01:44:58,930 --> 01:44:59,370
Yay!

2199
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:02,330
I don't know.

2200
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:03,530
Do I want to play it again?

2201
01:45:05,110 --> 01:45:08,630
Do I want to play it again?

2202
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:13,370
I feel kind of unfulfilled, but...

2203
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:15,770
I have to go through it all over again.

2204
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:19,650
I got really lucky this time where we really didn't make that many mistakes, so...

2205
01:45:19,650 --> 01:45:22,750
But I kind of went really slow because I was scared.

2206
01:45:25,730 --> 01:45:27,230
Continue from the stop?

2207
01:45:28,190 --> 01:45:29,270
Oh, there's a checkpoint!

2208
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:31,050
Oh, okay, okay.

2209
01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:32,970
Oh, hold...

2210
01:45:33,530 --> 01:45:34,910
Space key to skip.

2211
01:45:39,130 --> 01:45:39,630
Okay.

2212
01:45:39,630 --> 01:45:41,350
Wait, so where should I continue from?

2213
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:42,750
Train... from the green train?

2214
01:45:42,990 --> 01:45:43,410
Or...

2215
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:46,170
Wait, after...

2216
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:48,590
After stopping the train...

2217
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:52,880
Thank you!

2218
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:55,400
That was the bad end.

2219
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:56,720
You walked into the light.

2220
01:45:56,780 --> 01:45:57,440
You have to go back.

2221
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:59,100
Okay, so after stopping.

2222
01:45:59,320 --> 01:45:59,800
Okay, okay.

2223
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:04,440
So here I go forward, right?

2224
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:06,320
I don't go into the light.

2225
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:15,260
I'm scared.

2226
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:16,620
It's so quiet.

2227
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:25,000
What is that?

2228
01:46:25,180 --> 01:46:26,180
Wait, there's something in the...

2229
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:29,600
Oh, just kidding.

2230
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:34,760
Maybe the grandpa or the kid are in here?

2231
01:46:38,780 --> 01:46:39,380
Okay.

2232
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:41,380
Keep going forward, okay.

2233
01:46:42,660 --> 01:46:43,600
I am.

2234
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:45,320
Oh, wait.

2235
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:46,020
Wait.

2236
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:49,560
It's both vacant and occupied.

2237
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:51,520
How is that possible?

2238
01:46:52,460 --> 01:46:52,920
Oh!

2239
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:54,080
Just kidding.

2240
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:57,980
Was it like that the whole time?

2241
01:46:59,060 --> 01:47:00,640
The phone is also gone.

2242
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:02,980
Thank you for the...

2243
01:47:02,980 --> 01:47:03,280
Oh, no.

2244
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:03,720
Thank you.

2245
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:06,520
Don't forget the supporter content section.

2246
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:13,720
To see all the VTuber references on one train car.

2247
01:47:14,740 --> 01:47:15,200
To see all the VTuber references on one train car.

2248
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:15,420
I...

2249
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:17,480
I didn't turn the supporter stuff off.

2250
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:19,300
So I think I just didn't see them.

2251
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:23,140
Do I just keep going?

2252
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:24,860
Do I just keep going?

2253
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:28,440
How far do I need to go for?

2254
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:30,580
How far do I need to go for?

2255
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:32,020
How far do I need to go for?

2256
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:33,220
Schrödinger's bathroom.

2257
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:34,640
Schrödinger's bathroom.

2258
01:47:35,300 --> 01:47:35,940
Okay.

2259
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:38,420
Just go?

2260
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:38,960
Okay.

2261
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:40,720
I'm going.

2262
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:44,320
Is there anything in here?

2263
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:46,100
Grandpa?

2264
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:48,200
Kid in the bathroom?

2265
01:47:50,060 --> 01:47:51,080
No one in the bathroom.

2266
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:54,000
I don't even know why I'm going back through here.

2267
01:47:54,740 --> 01:47:55,680
All the way back?

2268
01:47:57,620 --> 01:47:57,980
Oh.

2269
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:00,620
Was that suitcase there before?

2270
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:03,320
Okay.

2271
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:04,040
I'm just going to run for it.

2272
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:05,800
Okay.

2273
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:14,990
I'm just going to run for it.

2274
01:48:14,990 --> 01:48:14,990
You

2275
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:28,890
have to walk all the way back to your seat.

2276
01:48:28,970 --> 01:48:30,330
If you want to see the supporter stuff.

2277
01:48:30,330 --> 01:48:32,490
I think you either choose supporter stuff...

2278
01:48:32,490 --> 01:48:32,670
Yeah.

2279
01:48:32,750 --> 01:48:32,930
Yeah.

2280
01:48:33,030 --> 01:48:36,170
But is that the only reason you guys are having me walk all the way back?

2281
01:48:36,550 --> 01:48:38,750
Or is it actually the way to get the other ending?

2282
01:48:40,730 --> 01:48:41,150
Because...

2283
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:51,560
Ah...

2284
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:52,620
Ah...

2285
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:53,520
Yeah...

2286
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:00,520
I'm going to check the bathroom every time.

2287
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:03,500
Still not there.

2288
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:05,000
I should probably like check on...

2289
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,320
Check in these corners too.

2290
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:07,940
Just in case.

2291
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:09,460
Okay.

2292
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:11,280
Other ending.

2293
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:12,420
On four.

2294
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:15,220
There were seven, right?

2295
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:18,800
I really have to go all the way back?

2296
01:49:28,460 --> 01:49:29,080
Yeah?

2297
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:30,380
Chuuu.

2298
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:31,060
Chuuu.

2299
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:32,540
Uh.

2300
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:32,940
Uh.

2301
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:33,600
Uh.

2302
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:34,100
Uh.

2303
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:36,840
Hold on.

2304
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:37,570
Give me one second.

2305
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:39,220
I'm going to do something real quick.

2306
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:41,180
Na na na.

2307
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:42,180
Na na.

2308
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:44,100
Okay.

2309
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:48,900
Um.

2310
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:55,880
Meow.

2311
01:49:56,640 --> 01:49:57,120
Meow.

2312
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:57,820
Meow.

2313
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:01,080
Do I have to check the bathroom every time?

2314
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:01,660
Or...

2315
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:03,460
Or can I...

2316
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:07,160
Or can I...

2317
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:07,440
Um.

2318
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:09,380
Ignore it.

2319
01:50:09,820 --> 01:50:10,300
Yes?

2320
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:13,440
So many people...

2321
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:14,880
Some people say yes.

2322
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:15,660
Some people say no.

2323
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:18,860
Why are you checking it even?

2324
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:20,580
In case the kid is in there, right?

2325
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:25,280
Always check the bathroom.

2326
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:27,000
Oh.

2327
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:38,040
She's awake.

2328
01:50:40,870 --> 01:50:41,590
Hello?

2329
01:50:41,830 --> 01:50:42,550
Oh.

2330
01:50:42,630 --> 01:50:44,430
She's like, where's my brother?

2331
01:50:44,650 --> 01:50:45,150
Oh.

2332
01:50:45,190 --> 01:50:45,490
Loading.

2333
01:50:46,610 --> 01:50:47,570
I see.

2334
01:50:48,450 --> 01:50:49,170
Okay.

2335
01:50:50,070 --> 01:50:51,590
This train didn't stop.

2336
01:50:52,570 --> 01:50:53,810
It was looping.

2337
01:50:54,170 --> 01:50:55,730
She sounds so cute.

2338
01:50:56,350 --> 01:50:58,710
So the train wasn't stopping and it was looping?

2339
01:50:58,870 --> 01:51:00,530
But I was able to stop this train.

2340
01:51:00,530 --> 01:51:01,190
But I was able to stop this train.

2341
01:51:02,290 --> 01:51:03,750
But I was able to stop this train.

2342
01:51:03,810 --> 01:51:07,510
Actually, I also just noticed that their mouths move now too.

2343
01:51:08,050 --> 01:51:08,610
Actually, I also just noticed that their mouths move now too.

2344
01:51:08,610 --> 01:51:09,110
Before...

2345
01:51:09,110 --> 01:51:15,910
In old Chilla's Art games, since it was just the P&G face, their mouths wouldn't really talk.

2346
01:51:16,430 --> 01:51:16,990
Right?

2347
01:51:18,170 --> 01:51:20,450
And he managed to hit the brakes and stop everything?

2348
01:51:20,730 --> 01:51:22,810
And he managed to hit the brakes and stop everything?

2349
01:51:23,490 --> 01:51:24,710
That's what she just said.

2350
01:51:27,530 --> 01:51:29,450
It turned off again.

2351
01:51:29,450 --> 01:51:31,270
Everything about this is so hard to believe.

2352
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:31,650
Oh.

2353
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:34,010
Oh my god, she's so cute!

2354
01:51:35,570 --> 01:51:38,150
I guess I have no choice but to believe you.

2355
01:51:38,210 --> 01:51:39,230
That is not what she said.

2356
01:51:39,310 --> 01:51:40,370
It feels weird.

2357
01:51:41,810 --> 01:51:42,950
I don't remember.

2358
01:51:44,370 --> 01:51:45,930
Something doesn't feel right.

2359
01:51:46,290 --> 01:51:48,090
I don't remember getting on this train.

2360
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:51,630
I don't remember boarding this train.

2361
01:51:53,430 --> 01:51:54,790
Boy in a black hoodie.

2362
01:51:55,010 --> 01:51:56,230
Oh, I saw your brother?

2363
01:51:56,910 --> 01:51:58,150
That's probably Naoki.

2364
01:51:58,650 --> 01:51:59,710
Oh, Naoki!

2365
01:52:00,270 --> 01:52:03,690
I'm sure he was with Naoki before he lost his memory.

2366
01:52:04,130 --> 01:52:06,290
I was with my brother before I lost my memory.

2367
01:52:10,170 --> 01:52:12,030
Why are you here?

2368
01:52:12,770 --> 01:52:13,950
Did you say anything?

2369
01:52:14,850 --> 01:52:15,850
God, she's so cute.

2370
01:52:15,930 --> 01:52:17,590
Did he say anything about why we're here?

2371
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:21,330
No.

2372
01:52:21,910 --> 01:52:22,970
You didn't see him?

2373
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:24,050
You are...

2374
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:28,330
You weren't with him?

2375
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:33,470
Did you see him on the way here?

2376
01:52:34,050 --> 01:52:34,710
Did you see him on the way here?

2377
01:52:34,710 --> 01:52:37,670
Oh, not after I stopped the train.

2378
01:52:37,790 --> 01:52:38,410
Oh, not after I stopped the train.

2379
01:52:42,190 --> 01:52:44,170
So you came from the green car side.

2380
01:52:46,790 --> 01:52:48,530
Then he must be on the other side.

2381
01:52:49,810 --> 01:52:50,610
Alright then!

2382
01:52:52,330 --> 01:52:53,930
Let's find him and get out!

2383
01:52:54,190 --> 01:52:54,470
Oh.

2384
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:56,950
Wait a minute.

2385
01:52:57,670 --> 01:52:58,070
Okay.

2386
01:52:59,210 --> 01:53:01,150
Why isn't that part subtitled?

2387
01:53:01,950 --> 01:53:06,970
If you think about it, there's a possibility that someone will come here again.

2388
01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:09,410
What do you mean by that?

2389
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:10,290
Come to think of it...

2390
01:53:10,290 --> 01:53:12,150
I feel sorry for him.

2391
01:53:13,030 --> 01:53:14,210
Oh, I guess that's true, yeah.

2392
01:53:14,310 --> 01:53:16,630
What about the people who might end up here in the future?

2393
01:53:16,870 --> 01:53:18,530
Shouldn't we do something about this train?

2394
01:53:19,350 --> 01:53:20,170
Dot, dot, dot.

2395
01:53:20,710 --> 01:53:21,630
Wait a minute.

2396
01:53:22,290 --> 01:53:24,730
Did you guys need subtitles for that one actually?

2397
01:53:26,030 --> 01:53:28,150
Shouldn't we think of a way to end this nightmare for good?

2398
01:53:29,710 --> 01:53:30,730
Let's burn it down!

2399
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:32,570
Let's burn the train!

2400
01:53:33,790 --> 01:53:36,750
A looping place.

2401
01:53:37,170 --> 01:53:41,250
I saw this in an anime...

2402
01:53:42,330 --> 01:53:43,250
Come on, girl.

2403
01:53:43,710 --> 01:53:45,110
You know what you wanna say.

2404
01:53:46,910 --> 01:53:48,470
You know what you wanna say.

2405
01:53:48,850 --> 01:53:50,990
It's just like one of my Japanese anime.

2406
01:53:51,930 --> 01:53:54,750
Oh, I remember.

2407
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:58,350
In the show...

2408
01:53:58,350 --> 01:53:59,530
In the show...

2409
01:53:59,530 --> 01:54:03,150
They ran in a really fast direction in the other direction and broke the loop.

2410
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:04,630
They ran in a really fast direction in the other direction and broke the loop.

2411
01:54:05,230 --> 01:54:08,230
They broke the loop by having two people run in the opposite direction REALLY FAST.

2412
01:54:08,230 --> 01:54:10,490
THEY BROKE THE LOOP BY HAVING TWO PEOPLE RUN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION REALLY FAST.

2413
01:54:11,570 --> 01:54:12,130
Huh?

2414
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:14,510
Jujutsu Kaisen reference?

2415
01:54:14,790 --> 01:54:15,510
Oh, actually...

2416
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:19,050
I only watched season 1 of Jujutsu Kaisen.

2417
01:54:19,950 --> 01:54:20,670
How was it?

2418
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:22,150
How about that?

2419
01:54:24,010 --> 01:54:29,330
But the train isn't looping anymore.

2420
01:54:33,350 --> 01:54:36,330
Right, the train stops looping after hitting the brakes.

2421
01:54:36,910 --> 01:54:38,430
Oh, I know!

2422
01:54:41,690 --> 01:54:44,890
What if we start the train at the same time?

2423
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:48,250
Why are we starting the train again?

2424
01:54:48,250 --> 01:54:49,190
From both ends.

2425
01:54:55,610 --> 01:54:58,250
You can go back to the green car side.

2426
01:55:00,230 --> 01:55:02,510
I'll go to the normal car side.

2427
01:55:03,090 --> 01:55:05,530
Why is there a... wait, I'm confused.

2428
01:55:05,790 --> 01:55:11,110
Why would there be a way to start the train on this side?

2429
01:55:13,370 --> 01:55:16,890
And also, we're closer to the normal car side.

2430
01:55:16,890 --> 01:55:18,830
So you're having me run all the way back?

2431
01:55:19,990 --> 01:55:22,070
No, I'll go to the normal side.

2432
01:55:22,150 --> 01:55:23,070
Wait, uh-oh.

2433
01:55:23,950 --> 01:55:25,510
Wait, does this affect the ending?

2434
01:55:25,770 --> 01:55:26,170
Uh-oh.

2435
01:55:27,790 --> 01:55:28,350
Uh-oh.

2436
01:55:31,670 --> 01:55:32,970
Go to the normal side?

2437
01:55:37,390 --> 01:55:39,050
Normal or you get the same ending?

2438
01:55:39,170 --> 01:55:40,010
Oh, okay, okay.

2439
01:55:40,090 --> 01:55:40,910
Thank you guys, thank you.

2440
01:55:41,210 --> 01:55:42,950
Go to the normal side or you get the same...

2441
01:55:42,950 --> 01:55:44,410
Okay, thank you guys, thank you!

2442
01:55:45,230 --> 01:55:46,110
Oh, I just saw it.

2443
01:55:46,150 --> 01:55:47,030
The other ending is...

2444
01:55:47,030 --> 01:55:49,390
Back to your seat and choose to go to white car.

2445
01:55:49,410 --> 01:55:53,030
The supporter stuff isn't related to the very start of the game as an anomaly.

2446
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:55,030
Ah, got it, got it, got it.

2447
01:55:56,050 --> 01:55:56,490
Understandable.

2448
01:55:56,570 --> 01:55:57,210
Thank you.

2449
01:55:59,830 --> 01:56:02,070
Okay, so I'll go to the normal side.

2450
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:04,030
Is that so?

2451
01:56:04,670 --> 01:56:05,490
Are you sure?

2452
01:56:05,770 --> 01:56:09,210
I think my brother is on the normal side.

2453
01:56:10,570 --> 01:56:12,250
My brother is on the other side.

2454
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:14,110
I'm going to have to leave my brother to you.

2455
01:56:15,430 --> 01:56:17,410
Can I trust you with my brother?

2456
01:56:17,690 --> 01:56:18,550
Leave it to me.

2457
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:21,150
But you were able to stop the train.

2458
01:56:21,970 --> 01:56:23,430
Yeah, I'm competent.

2459
01:56:23,770 --> 01:56:25,730
Well, you did manage to stop the train.

2460
01:56:25,950 --> 01:56:26,470
Understood.

2461
01:56:26,990 --> 01:56:27,850
Alright then.

2462
01:56:27,970 --> 01:56:31,270
Then I'll leave my brother, Naoki, to you.

2463
01:56:31,970 --> 01:56:33,170
I trust you, mister.

2464
01:56:34,190 --> 01:56:35,550
Let's do our best together.

2465
01:56:35,970 --> 01:56:37,190
Yeah, alright then.

2466
01:56:37,550 --> 01:56:37,870
Let's hurry.

2467
01:56:38,370 --> 01:56:38,890
Let's hurry.

2468
01:56:39,150 --> 01:56:41,450
Before this train starts moving again.

2469
01:56:41,670 --> 01:56:43,650
Who knows when the train will start again.

2470
01:56:45,070 --> 01:56:45,670
Okay.

2471
01:56:47,090 --> 01:56:47,690
Let's go.

2472
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:53,680
Let's hurry.

2473
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:55,580
That's what you said.

2474
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:56,440
Come on.

2475
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:57,740
Let's hurry.

2476
01:56:58,300 --> 01:56:59,120
Get running, girl.

2477
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:01,640
Get running.

2478
01:57:06,190 --> 01:57:07,070
Where's the kid?

2479
01:57:07,810 --> 01:57:09,010
What just happened?

2480
01:57:10,050 --> 01:57:10,650
Hello?

2481
01:57:14,390 --> 01:57:15,550
Oh, it's not even...

2482
01:57:15,550 --> 01:57:16,750
I don't think it's letting me.

2483
01:57:16,990 --> 01:57:17,810
I'm scared.

2484
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:21,750
What's gonna happen?

2485
01:57:21,890 --> 01:57:22,210
I'm scared.

2486
01:57:24,590 --> 01:57:25,910
Is someone gonna chase me?

2487
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:28,950
I swear.

2488
01:57:29,050 --> 01:57:31,590
If you come trying to chase me, I'm gonna...

2489
01:57:33,630 --> 01:57:34,670
I'm gonna do something.

2490
01:57:37,430 --> 01:57:38,570
You're not gonna like it.

2491
01:57:41,310 --> 01:57:41,730
Run?

2492
01:57:42,050 --> 01:57:42,470
Okay.

2493
01:57:42,750 --> 01:57:43,070
I'm running.

2494
01:57:43,210 --> 01:57:43,450
I'm running.

2495
01:57:43,570 --> 01:57:43,870
I'm running.

2496
01:57:44,030 --> 01:57:44,410
Why?

2497
01:57:44,470 --> 01:57:45,510
Are they already chasing after me?

2498
01:57:45,650 --> 01:57:47,070
Are they already chasing after me?

2499
01:57:48,550 --> 01:57:49,710
I don't hear anything though.

2500
01:57:50,210 --> 01:57:52,250
Are they like an invisible force chasing after me?

2501
01:57:55,590 --> 01:57:55,830
Okay.

2502
01:57:56,450 --> 01:57:56,850
I'm running.

2503
01:57:57,370 --> 01:57:57,790
I'm running.

2504
01:57:58,210 --> 01:57:58,630
I'm running.

2505
01:57:58,690 --> 01:57:58,910
I'm running.

2506
01:57:59,010 --> 01:57:59,250
I'm running.

2507
01:57:59,310 --> 01:57:59,550
I'm running.

2508
01:57:59,610 --> 01:58:00,150
I'm running.

2509
01:58:00,590 --> 01:58:00,790
I'm running.

2510
01:58:00,910 --> 01:58:01,170
I'm running.

2511
01:58:01,270 --> 01:58:01,530
I'm running.

2512
01:58:01,770 --> 01:58:02,190
I'm running.

2513
01:58:02,590 --> 01:58:02,730
I'm running.

2514
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:03,150
I'm running.

2515
01:58:03,190 --> 01:58:03,250
I'm running.

2516
01:58:03,250 --> 01:58:03,470
I'm running.

2517
01:58:03,530 --> 01:58:03,750
I'm running.

2518
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:03,790
I'm running.

2519
01:58:03,890 --> 01:58:03,950
I'm running.

2520
01:58:03,950 --> 01:58:04,150
I'm running.

2521
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:04,430
I'm running.

2522
01:58:06,710 --> 01:58:06,950
I'm running.

2523
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:10,010
Go go go go!

2524
01:58:10,290 --> 01:58:11,010
There's the music!

2525
01:58:11,170 --> 01:58:11,830
There's the music!

2526
01:58:30,650 --> 01:58:32,290
What's chasing me?!

2527
01:58:32,290 --> 01:58:33,130
Oh

2528
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:40,920
it's shrinking!

2529
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:41,600
It's shrinking!

2530
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:42,140
It's shrinking!

2531
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:45,160
Oh my god!

2532
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:46,420
It's still shrinking!

2533
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:47,020
It's still shrinking!

2534
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:51,660
Oh no no no no no no!

2535
01:58:52,740 --> 01:58:53,340
It's crushing!

2536
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:53,860
It's crushing!

2537
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:54,220
It's crushing!

2538
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:55,180
Oh my god!

2539
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:55,560
No, no, no!

2540
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:56,920
No, no, no, no, no!

2541
01:58:57,140 --> 01:58:57,720
Oh my god!

2542
01:58:58,100 --> 01:58:58,420
Oh!

2543
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:00,380
It's just like in my nightmares!

2544
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:01,880
Ah!

2545
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:02,440
Ah!

2546
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:02,600
Oh!

2547
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:04,120
Oh!

2548
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:04,840
Oh!

2549
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:05,720
Oh!

2550
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:08,980
Whoa!

2551
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:14,620
Woo!

2552
01:59:19,180 --> 01:59:19,820
It's beautiful!

2553
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:22,960
Wait, we're in the actual normal world!

2554
01:59:23,100 --> 01:59:23,960
We made it back?

2555
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:24,760
Maybe?

2556
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:26,900
Oh my gosh!

2557
01:59:27,240 --> 01:59:27,540
Oh!

2558
01:59:27,700 --> 01:59:28,060
Oh!

2559
01:59:29,160 --> 01:59:30,760
Maybe we're not in the normal world.

2560
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:32,140
Actually, I'm not so sure.

2561
01:59:33,980 --> 01:59:34,940
Um, hmm.

2562
01:59:35,780 --> 01:59:37,560
I love my void trees.

2563
01:59:37,980 --> 01:59:38,640
You know?

2564
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:41,620
Uh, oh wait.

2565
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:42,300
Uh, wait.

2566
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:43,340
Where's the door here?

2567
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:46,560
Oh, I can't go out?

2568
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:47,160
Okay.

2569
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:47,680
Oh!

2570
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:48,260
Oh!

2571
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:50,000
Oh my god!

2572
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:50,580
We made it!

2573
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:53,500
Oh!

2574
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:54,300
Oh!

2575
02:00:01,370 --> 02:00:02,090
And...

2576
02:00:02,090 --> 02:00:03,230
Ah!

2577
02:00:03,630 --> 02:00:03,970
Sorry!

2578
02:00:04,350 --> 02:00:04,610
Ow!

2579
02:00:08,290 --> 02:00:09,450
Onii-san, you're here!

2580
02:00:10,090 --> 02:00:11,330
I've been waiting for you!

2581
02:00:12,330 --> 02:00:13,530
Freaky ghost!

2582
02:00:13,550 --> 02:00:14,990
Onii-chan, you're here!

2583
02:00:15,410 --> 02:00:16,830
You woke up!

2584
02:00:18,910 --> 02:00:19,630
Naoki!

2585
02:00:20,530 --> 02:00:21,770
I'm glad you're safe.

2586
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:22,910
You're okay!

2587
02:00:24,010 --> 02:00:26,290
Onii-san, I'm okay now.

2588
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:29,010
I'm fine now, Mr. That's right!

2589
02:00:29,410 --> 02:00:31,150
Onii-san, do you want to come with us?

2590
02:00:31,250 --> 02:00:32,510
You want to come with us?

2591
02:00:34,190 --> 02:00:34,670
Oh!

2592
02:00:34,670 --> 02:00:36,350
I only have... No, not yet.

2593
02:00:36,690 --> 02:00:37,550
That's right.

2594
02:00:38,110 --> 02:00:38,930
You're right.

2595
02:00:39,790 --> 02:00:40,690
I don't think you should come.

2596
02:00:41,970 --> 02:00:43,810
It's not your time yet?

2597
02:00:47,050 --> 02:00:48,390
Am I dead for real?

2598
02:00:48,750 --> 02:00:49,410
I don't know.

2599
02:00:50,450 --> 02:00:51,350
I don't know.

2600
02:00:51,670 --> 02:00:53,550
I think I know what happened to us.

2601
02:00:55,070 --> 02:00:56,590
I think I know what happened to us.

2602
02:00:57,390 --> 02:00:58,150
Don't worry.

2603
02:00:59,570 --> 02:01:00,630
Wait, so...

2604
02:01:00,630 --> 02:01:02,190
But they're gonna come back to life, right?

2605
02:01:02,250 --> 02:01:02,850
It's okay, mister?

2606
02:01:04,010 --> 02:01:06,550
Or they are... they're the dead ones!

2607
02:01:08,370 --> 02:01:10,830
I think, actually, they're the dead ones.

2608
02:01:11,110 --> 02:01:12,590
More importantly...

2609
02:01:14,950 --> 02:01:16,630
We have to get home.

2610
02:01:17,710 --> 02:01:19,130
We have to get home.

2611
02:01:20,350 --> 02:01:21,330
Thank you, mister.

2612
02:01:22,270 --> 02:01:23,250
And goodbye.

2613
02:01:25,270 --> 02:01:26,290
Oh my god.

2614
02:01:27,590 --> 02:01:28,910
Thanks, kid.

2615
02:01:29,450 --> 02:01:31,350
Don't go breaking your arm for me.

2616
02:01:33,430 --> 02:01:34,410
No, I think...

2617
02:01:34,410 --> 02:01:35,750
I think they're the dead ones.

2618
02:01:35,850 --> 02:01:37,570
I can feel it as a ghost.

2619
02:01:37,670 --> 02:01:39,310
I get that sense from them.

2620
02:01:42,410 --> 02:01:43,530
I fell?

2621
02:01:46,590 --> 02:01:47,090
Oh!

2622
02:01:48,190 --> 02:01:48,750
Wait!

2623
02:01:49,550 --> 02:01:50,110
Wait!

2624
02:01:51,790 --> 02:01:53,350
Remember when the...

2625
02:01:54,270 --> 02:01:55,710
Remember when the...

2626
02:01:56,590 --> 02:01:57,170
Thank you for the raid!

2627
02:01:57,310 --> 02:01:57,990
Thank you so much!

2628
02:01:58,150 --> 02:02:03,710
Remember when we had the train stop because of the personal injury?

2629
02:02:08,770 --> 02:02:10,230
You were collapsed on the floor.

2630
02:02:12,630 --> 02:02:14,490
Luckily, there was a doctor on board.

2631
02:02:19,270 --> 02:02:21,050
That does not sound real.

2632
02:02:21,470 --> 02:02:26,730
It seems you were suffering a light form of deep vein thrombosis.

2633
02:02:26,990 --> 02:02:27,370
What?

2634
02:02:34,590 --> 02:02:35,670
That's a voice.

2635
02:02:36,470 --> 02:02:40,630
Or what the lemans call it, economy class syndrome.

2636
02:02:41,290 --> 02:02:47,930
You guys, I called it from the very beginning that this was a game about the rich.

2637
02:02:51,230 --> 02:02:54,450
They actually did stuff our body up in there.

2638
02:02:58,110 --> 02:02:59,510
I can't believe it!

2639
02:03:00,130 --> 02:03:01,250
I can't believe it!

2640
02:03:01,270 --> 02:03:02,170
I was right this whole time!

2641
02:03:10,390 --> 02:03:15,150
For some reason, I thought we were in the bathroom and I was like, please do not lay me on the ground in the bathroom.

2642
02:03:16,610 --> 02:03:18,590
Also, are they like on little stools?

2643
02:03:20,650 --> 02:03:23,710
I thought they were crouched at first, but it looks like they have little tiny benches.

2644
02:03:24,170 --> 02:03:26,430
Laying down and raising the legs seem to have helped.

2645
02:03:28,710 --> 02:03:30,470
You should be thankful he was here.

2646
02:03:33,150 --> 02:03:34,650
You should be thankful he was here.

2647
02:03:40,430 --> 02:03:41,730
Oh my gosh.

2648
02:03:42,090 --> 02:03:44,090
It would have taken much longer to get help.

2649
02:03:48,450 --> 02:03:51,490
Because the train had also stopped while you were out.

2650
02:03:52,690 --> 02:03:54,590
Because of that accident, this train has stopped for a while.

2651
02:03:55,650 --> 02:03:56,090
Oh.

2652
02:03:57,810 --> 02:03:59,490
She said the personal injury.

2653
02:03:59,550 --> 02:04:00,610
It stopped because of the personal injury.

2654
02:04:00,790 --> 02:04:01,130
Excuse me.

2655
02:04:01,370 --> 02:04:02,130
This is a business call.

2656
02:04:02,970 --> 02:04:04,150
What is she, your mom?

2657
02:04:04,170 --> 02:04:04,550
Right!

2658
02:04:05,470 --> 02:04:05,910
Reporting.

2659
02:04:06,150 --> 02:04:09,070
It was confirmed that a young woman and a boy were involved in the accident.

2660
02:04:09,890 --> 02:04:11,450
Oh, that was the injury.

2661
02:04:11,850 --> 02:04:12,490
Okay, wait.

2662
02:04:14,150 --> 02:04:15,130
Are we the injury?

2663
02:04:16,570 --> 02:04:17,250
Oh no.

2664
02:04:17,310 --> 02:04:20,610
A young woman and a boy were confirmed to be involved in the accident.

2665
02:04:21,210 --> 02:04:21,650
Over.

2666
02:04:22,690 --> 02:04:23,270
Oh.

2667
02:04:25,430 --> 02:04:26,970
I knew they were dead.

2668
02:04:29,790 --> 02:04:31,950
And I was almost dead too.

2669
02:04:33,630 --> 02:04:36,310
Because I had to sit in an economy.

2670
02:04:38,230 --> 02:04:40,490
Ending to sad reality.

2671
02:04:44,890 --> 02:04:47,550
That's why you got hit.

2672
02:04:48,490 --> 02:04:51,270
Don't go walking in the middle of the train tracks.

2673
02:04:51,530 --> 02:04:52,250
Don't go walking in the middle of the train tracks.

2674
02:04:55,130 --> 02:04:55,730
Uh.

2675
02:04:59,130 --> 02:04:59,730
Oh.

2676
02:05:00,150 --> 02:05:01,410
Here's our song.

2677
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:08,910
Ah.

2678
02:05:09,410 --> 02:05:11,210
Economy seats were too uncomfortable.

2679
02:05:12,210 --> 02:05:13,170
Look at that guy.

2680
02:05:13,290 --> 02:05:14,230
We saw him, right?

2681
02:05:14,430 --> 02:05:18,010
We saw him in the first class.

2682
02:05:18,610 --> 02:05:22,870
He literally was making fun of us.

2683
02:05:26,130 --> 02:05:30,790
It's always interesting seeing what VTubers are in the credits.

2684
02:05:31,430 --> 02:05:34,150
Maybe one day I will be in the credits.

2685
02:05:34,730 --> 02:05:36,910
I know I would have to do it myself.

2686
02:05:37,190 --> 02:05:40,530
Like I know I have to subscribe to the Patreon.

2687
02:05:40,810 --> 02:05:41,950
But maybe I'll do it one day.

2688
02:05:42,350 --> 02:05:46,890
I think every time I play one of these games, I say I'll do it.

2689
02:05:46,950 --> 02:05:47,790
And then I forget.

2690
02:05:49,310 --> 02:05:51,490
And then I forget completely.

2691
02:05:52,730 --> 02:05:54,450
Champ's company, why are you so...

2692
02:05:57,030 --> 02:05:57,610
One day.

2693
02:05:57,710 --> 02:05:57,990
Yeah.

2694
02:05:58,070 --> 02:05:59,490
One day I will be a supporter too.

2695
02:06:00,250 --> 02:06:01,050
I say that.

2696
02:06:01,090 --> 02:06:03,830
I say like one day as if like it is this great honor.

2697
02:06:04,390 --> 02:06:06,470
Even though it's just something I need to do myself.

2698
02:06:09,630 --> 02:06:09,990
Okay.

2699
02:06:10,170 --> 02:06:11,090
Next game, guys.

2700
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:12,590
Next Chilla's Art game.

2701
02:06:13,090 --> 02:06:14,910
I'm gonna put my name in the game.

2702
02:06:16,190 --> 02:06:16,550
Okay?

2703
02:06:16,550 --> 02:06:18,390
I think I belong there because I'm a ghost.

2704
02:06:21,230 --> 02:06:22,450
Yeah, you just pay up.

2705
02:06:22,690 --> 02:06:23,050
Exactly.

2706
02:06:24,450 --> 02:06:26,150
I just have to remember to do it.

2707
02:06:28,730 --> 02:06:30,550
I just have to remember to do it.

2708
02:06:30,630 --> 02:06:31,250
I always forget.

2709
02:06:32,610 --> 02:06:34,130
Though I... Thank you.

2710
02:06:34,630 --> 02:06:38,170
Deep vein thrombosis means having a blood clot in your leg veins.

2711
02:06:38,270 --> 02:06:40,750
Most often, which can happen due to sitting too much.

2712
02:06:40,790 --> 02:06:42,010
If not treated, it can be fatal.

2713
02:06:42,650 --> 02:06:44,190
Or cause loss of limbs.

2714
02:06:44,350 --> 02:06:44,850
Oh my gosh.

2715
02:06:44,850 --> 02:06:45,510
Wait, actually?

2716
02:06:47,370 --> 02:06:48,430
This song is so fine.

2717
02:06:48,510 --> 02:06:48,970
I like it.

2718
02:06:51,490 --> 02:06:57,550
I saw that there's a way to put yourself as a character in the game.

2719
02:06:57,670 --> 02:06:59,470
Can you imagine if I was one of the ghosts?

2720
02:07:01,350 --> 02:07:02,610
Wouldn't that be so fun?

2721
02:07:03,890 --> 02:07:06,530
Wouldn't it be so fun if I was chasing after you?

2722
02:07:10,730 --> 02:07:12,350
I'm gonna ask her to be like, Hey.

2723
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:13,650
Oh, it is?

2724
02:07:13,750 --> 02:07:14,930
It was an actual movie.

2725
02:07:18,490 --> 02:07:19,410
A sponsor?

2726
02:07:20,510 --> 02:07:20,970
Hey...

2727
02:07:20,970 --> 02:07:21,430
Hey...

2728
02:07:22,630 --> 02:07:24,110
You were Orochimaru.

2729
02:07:24,930 --> 02:07:26,490
I'm just chillin'.

2730
02:07:26,490 --> 02:07:27,590
I'm chillas.

2731
02:07:27,610 --> 02:07:28,970
I'm chillin' in the sea.

2732
02:07:29,790 --> 02:07:30,850
That one...

2733
02:07:30,850 --> 02:07:32,610
I think...

2734
02:07:32,610 --> 02:07:34,050
Um...

2735
02:07:34,630 --> 02:07:35,510
I think...

2736
02:07:36,750 --> 02:07:40,310
Actually, what happened in this is what kind of...

2737
02:07:41,710 --> 02:07:42,430
Um...

2738
02:07:42,710 --> 02:07:44,370
Gets me about these...

2739
02:07:44,970 --> 02:07:46,190
Find the...

2740
02:07:46,810 --> 02:07:48,570
Find the anomaly type of game.

2741
02:07:48,830 --> 02:07:49,910
You know what I mean?

2742
02:07:49,990 --> 02:07:50,450
So...

2743
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:59,990
I love these types of games, but because they're randomized you can get a lot or you can get a little.

2744
02:08:01,690 --> 02:08:02,970
And so...

2745
02:08:02,970 --> 02:08:04,110
Um...

2746
02:08:04,850 --> 02:08:05,490
Mmm...

2747
02:08:07,590 --> 02:08:08,870
So... Yeah...

2748
02:08:08,870 --> 02:08:10,010
I don't know.

2749
02:08:10,250 --> 02:08:10,690
I...

2750
02:08:10,690 --> 02:08:11,010
I...

2751
02:08:13,270 --> 02:08:15,270
Um... I still liked it.

2752
02:08:15,630 --> 02:08:19,570
Just felt like maybe we didn't get some of the more interesting...

2753
02:08:20,970 --> 02:08:22,550
more interesting anomalies.

2754
02:08:23,250 --> 02:08:23,690
Maybe.

2755
02:08:23,990 --> 02:08:24,850
Like, gotcha.

2756
02:08:24,910 --> 02:08:25,770
Yeah, exactly.

2757
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:26,250
Exactly.

2758
02:08:26,630 --> 02:08:31,090
But we got pretty lucky in that we could finish it, like, without much error.

2759
02:08:32,590 --> 02:08:34,490
You can continue and find the anomalies.

2760
02:08:34,530 --> 02:08:34,930
That's true.

2761
02:08:34,970 --> 02:08:35,370
That's true.

2762
02:08:35,390 --> 02:08:35,730
That's true.

2763
02:08:36,690 --> 02:08:39,730
Continue supporter... You guys really want me to do the supporter content.

2764
02:08:39,910 --> 02:08:40,390
Oh my gosh.

2765
02:08:42,830 --> 02:08:43,570
Calm down.

2766
02:08:44,790 --> 02:08:45,570
Calm down.

2767
02:08:46,970 --> 02:08:48,170
Oh, that's cute though.

2768
02:08:48,250 --> 02:08:50,150
The way that they just have it like all...

2769
02:08:52,490 --> 02:08:53,370
like just...

2770
02:08:53,370 --> 02:08:54,170
here...

2771
02:08:56,290 --> 02:08:57,530
They're just like...

2772
02:08:58,830 --> 02:09:00,910
It's all... It's all just laid out.

2773
02:09:05,420 --> 02:09:07,120
Wait, so is there... Is this...

2774
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:08,280
Is this just...

2775
02:09:09,420 --> 02:09:10,600
There's no anomalies?

2776
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:12,240
It's just looking at the supporter content?

2777
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:13,740
I guess this is a cute way of doing it.

2778
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:14,760
Especially... Oh my god!

2779
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:16,780
Oh, he's... I forgot he was here!

2780
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:17,780
Wait... Oh!

2781
02:09:18,640 --> 02:09:20,020
They go all the way down?

2782
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:23,500
Oh!

2783
02:09:29,220 --> 02:09:30,980
I feel like this would make more...

2784
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:32,400
Oh my god, so cute!

2785
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:35,120
I feel like this would make more sense in the...

2786
02:09:37,220 --> 02:09:37,920
What's it called?

2787
02:09:39,020 --> 02:09:40,240
Pick things up?

2788
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:44,000
Cute!

2789
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:47,240
Oh my gosh, so cute!

2790
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:50,040
My throat hurts from screaming.

2791
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:51,480
That's so cute!

2792
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:52,280
Oh my gosh!

2793
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:53,620
So cute!

2794
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:57,860
You guys, I found out something that made me so sad.

2795
02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:01,300
Okay, so I love eating Inari Sushi.

2796
02:10:02,760 --> 02:10:03,800
And I was like...

2797
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:05,580
I was like, this is healthy, right?

2798
02:10:05,660 --> 02:10:06,080
It's tofu!

2799
02:10:06,380 --> 02:10:07,720
I mean, I know it's fried tofu.

2800
02:10:07,980 --> 02:10:08,760
But like, it's tofu.

2801
02:10:09,380 --> 02:10:17,060
And then I googled it, and they were like, Inari Sushi is really not good for you because of the oils, and this and that, and this and that, and I was like...

2802
02:10:19,180 --> 02:10:20,380
But it's like...

2803
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:22,720
It's so delicious!

2804
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:25,200
Healthy, it's so oily.

2805
02:10:25,420 --> 02:10:27,300
I never thought of it, okay?

2806
02:10:28,140 --> 02:10:29,740
I never thought of it.

2807
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:30,360
Like...

2808
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:33,520
I wanna see the sandwich.

2809
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:35,680
Oh, nevermind.

2810
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:41,400
Helsing game?

2811
02:10:42,580 --> 02:10:44,040
Like, Helsing the anime?

2812
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:47,480
I like the train.

2813
02:10:48,980 --> 02:10:50,720
Hey Chillizart, put me on the train.

2814
02:10:50,980 --> 02:10:52,640
The Edo train.

2815
02:10:54,040 --> 02:10:55,700
I can't even read this one.

2816
02:10:56,380 --> 02:10:57,460
It's so small.

2817
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:05,420
Get off today!

2818
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:07,280
Oh my gosh, Winter Cedar, no!

2819
02:11:09,680 --> 02:11:11,700
I wanna donate while I can.

2820
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:12,200
What?

2821
02:11:12,280 --> 02:11:12,580
No!

2822
02:11:13,180 --> 02:11:14,340
Oh my gosh, no!

2823
02:11:17,480 --> 02:11:18,800
Is there something on the suitcase?

2824
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:19,980
Oh gosh!

2825
02:11:20,220 --> 02:11:25,540
There is...

2826
02:11:25,540 --> 02:11:28,080
Oh my gosh, there's little chinchillas under the sea!

2827
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:29,120
That's so cute!

2828
02:11:30,540 --> 02:11:31,940
I wish I could crouch.

2829
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:33,560
Eww.

2830
02:11:34,380 --> 02:11:34,980
Scary.

2831
02:11:41,900 --> 02:11:43,080
Inuyama Tamaki!

2832
02:11:45,880 --> 02:11:46,480
Cute.

2833
02:11:47,380 --> 02:11:51,800
I think Tamaki-san has been in like every game ever.

2834
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,380
Or every Chillizart game that I've seen.

2835
02:11:56,620 --> 02:11:59,000
I think he's been in every single one.

2836
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:01,720
For as long as I can remember.

2837
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:02,420
Hahahaha!

2838
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:05,860
Uh...

2839
02:12:13,380 --> 02:12:14,340
Mlekka movies.

2840
02:12:14,940 --> 02:12:16,460
This is making me hungry.

2841
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:18,740
Hot coffee.

2842
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:21,480
This is making me hungry.

2843
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:24,440
Oh cute!

2844
02:12:28,420 --> 02:12:29,780
Ronald McDonald!

2845
02:12:31,700 --> 02:12:32,480
Hahahaha!

2846
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:33,860
That's so cute!

2847
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:34,620
Ronald McDonald!

2848
02:12:35,570 --> 02:12:36,260
Very delicious!

2849
02:12:39,630 --> 02:12:39,980
Oh!

2850
02:12:40,140 --> 02:12:40,880
It's Iris!

2851
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:41,660
Hahahaha!

2852
02:12:42,220 --> 02:12:45,160
Wait, wasn't Ollie in another game?

2853
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:46,820
Wait, this one's so funny.

2854
02:12:47,060 --> 02:12:49,300
The way she's like squished against the can.

2855
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:51,060
Iris cider.

2856
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:53,980
Uh...

2857
02:12:53,980 --> 02:12:55,200
Oh, it's a song.

2858
02:12:57,550 --> 02:12:57,900
Cute.

2859
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:00,680
Nabu nabu bento.

2860
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:02,780
Hi Iris!

2861
02:13:03,080 --> 02:13:03,980
It's Iris!

2862
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:05,880
Uh...

2863
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:07,320
I can't grab the...

2864
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:07,460
Uh...

2865
02:13:09,420 --> 02:13:13,140
Oh my gosh.

2866
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:14,780
No wonder.

2867
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:15,720
I couldn't...

2868
02:13:15,720 --> 02:13:16,940
It's just like a couple.

2869
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:18,140
They're just bragging.

2870
02:13:19,340 --> 02:13:22,080
All that effort just to see a damn couple.

2871
02:13:24,640 --> 02:13:25,600
Good for you.

2872
02:13:29,340 --> 02:13:30,800
You've missed a few of the stars.

2873
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:31,200
I know.

2874
02:13:31,360 --> 02:13:32,680
I'm gonna go back.

2875
02:13:33,220 --> 02:13:33,600
Hahahaha!

2876
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:35,040
Hahahaha!

2877
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:37,400
That's uh...

2878
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:39,300
That's uh...

2879
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:42,980
I want that exact same type of energy.

2880
02:13:44,060 --> 02:13:45,460
If I am in the game.

2881
02:13:45,940 --> 02:13:48,520
That's the kind of picture I'm gonna send in.

2882
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:52,220
Yeah, I'll go back and look at some of the other ones.

2883
02:13:52,680 --> 02:13:54,360
Are these Korean VTubers?

2884
02:13:54,760 --> 02:13:56,620
A cute vanilla strawberry.

2885
02:13:58,320 --> 02:13:58,920
Cute.

2886
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:02,040
This is making me hungry, you guys.

2887
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:03,040
All I had was cereal.

2888
02:14:03,660 --> 02:14:04,720
Oh, cute.

2889
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:08,740
Mmm...

2890
02:14:08,740 --> 02:14:09,740
Peach tea.

2891
02:14:10,940 --> 02:14:14,320
Lots of people just leaving their garbage everywhere.

2892
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:19,720
Rainbow ice.

2893
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:21,820
Cute.

2894
02:14:29,850 --> 02:14:31,090
Ume drink.

2895
02:14:32,710 --> 02:14:34,090
Where did I... I don't even...

2896
02:14:34,090 --> 02:14:34,390
Oh...

2897
02:14:34,390 --> 02:14:36,430
What is going on here?

2898
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:54,440
Where did I... Where did I start?

2899
02:14:54,580 --> 02:14:55,160
I don't remember.

2900
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:57,980
Oh my god, cute!

2901
02:14:58,800 --> 02:14:58,900
Duh!

2902
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:00,840
Neko ice!

2903
02:15:04,540 --> 02:15:05,180
Hahahaha!

2904
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:07,520
Hahahaha!

2905
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:09,520
Hahahaha!

2906
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:09,720
Hahahaha!

2907
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:12,780
I think we saw something very cursed.

2908
02:15:12,900 --> 02:15:14,400
I think we saw something that we shouldn't have.

2909
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:15,020
That... Oh!

2910
02:15:15,100 --> 02:15:16,360
That was the anomaly.

2911
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:19,560
Oh, we saw these ones.

2912
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:21,300
We saw...

2913
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:22,040
Did we see this one?

2914
02:15:22,040 --> 02:15:22,420
Yeah, yeah.

2915
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:23,220
We saw these.

2916
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:24,980
Did I see this one?

2917
02:15:25,940 --> 02:15:26,860
No, cute.

2918
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:29,680
Ahem.

2919
02:15:32,680 --> 02:15:33,080
Gyutang.

2920
02:15:34,580 --> 02:15:35,880
Do you guys like gyutang?

2921
02:15:35,980 --> 02:15:37,220
Have you ever had gyutang before?

2922
02:15:41,190 --> 02:15:42,190
Cow tongue.

2923
02:15:43,690 --> 02:15:44,230
Cow tongue.

2924
02:15:44,230 --> 02:15:46,210
I'm not such a huge fan.

2925
02:15:47,430 --> 02:15:48,070
I'm not such a huge fan.

2926
02:15:48,250 --> 02:15:49,450
Are there more cars?

2927
02:15:49,810 --> 02:15:50,890
I don't think so.

2928
02:15:52,710 --> 02:15:53,930
Actually, I say that.

2929
02:15:54,010 --> 02:15:54,510
I have no idea.

2930
02:15:54,910 --> 02:15:55,730
Oh, nope.

2931
02:15:57,950 --> 02:15:59,350
Where did I leave off?

2932
02:16:00,730 --> 02:16:01,830
I heard it's good.

2933
02:16:01,890 --> 02:16:05,630
I don't like really chewy meat.

2934
02:16:06,250 --> 02:16:07,750
I heard it's good.

2935
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:08,950
I don't like really chewy meat.

2936
02:16:08,950 --> 02:16:10,310
You might not like it either.

2937
02:16:10,450 --> 02:16:11,630
The taste is good.

2938
02:16:11,870 --> 02:16:13,790
But it's super...

2939
02:16:16,630 --> 02:16:18,710
So that's why I don't like it.

2940
02:16:19,890 --> 02:16:20,510
Sam?

2941
02:16:20,730 --> 02:16:21,030
Yeah.

2942
02:16:22,330 --> 02:16:23,330
Oh, wow!

2943
02:16:26,890 --> 02:16:27,510
Siobhan!

2944
02:16:28,770 --> 02:16:30,030
Work it, girl!

2945
02:16:31,190 --> 02:16:33,670
Get your face on the bento.

2946
02:16:33,690 --> 02:16:33,990
Get your face on the bento.

2947
02:16:33,990 --> 02:16:34,850
Hell yeah!

2948
02:16:35,330 --> 02:16:35,650
Hell yeah!

2949
02:16:38,950 --> 02:16:39,950
That's so funny.

2950
02:16:40,310 --> 02:16:41,190
Latte rich.

2951
02:16:41,570 --> 02:16:42,310
Oh, cute!

2952
02:16:44,210 --> 02:16:44,770
Cute.

2953
02:16:46,930 --> 02:16:48,730
Do people typically go through these?

2954
02:16:57,680 --> 02:16:58,980
Is this it?

2955
02:16:59,860 --> 02:17:03,380
Is this why you guys wanted me to go through the entire train?

2956
02:17:03,460 --> 02:17:06,020
Is this why you berated me to look through the supporters?

2957
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:14,160
Is this why you berated me to look through the supporters?

2958
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:15,300
That's really clever, actually.

2959
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:20,060
The fact that she's in the...

2960
02:17:20,060 --> 02:17:21,520
The fact that she's in the...

2961
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:22,320
In the salad.

2962
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:24,120
In the salad.

2963
02:17:28,250 --> 02:17:30,070
Oh my god.

2964
02:17:30,910 --> 02:17:32,030
Oh, cute!

2965
02:17:32,850 --> 02:17:33,730
Oh, cute!

2966
02:17:34,550 --> 02:17:35,210
Cute, cute, cute.

2967
02:17:36,650 --> 02:17:38,190
There's Ollie somewhere too?

2968
02:17:38,430 --> 02:17:39,230
Okay, we'll find her.

2969
02:17:43,860 --> 02:17:44,880
Old man.

2970

Surprised there's not vtuber energy drink.

2979
02:18:07,400 --> 02:18:08,960
Imagine being a frog man.

02:19:12,170 --> 02:19:12,370
If I were to get one, no one would find me.

3007
02:19:12,370 --> 02:19:12,750
I think.

3008
02:19:12,970 --> 02:19:13,310

02:19:53,380 --> 02:19:54,020
Wowee.

3025
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:55,440
What's the floor mean?

3026
02:19:57,340 --> 02:19:58,660
We're in seat 13.

3027
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:00,160

02:20:09,720 --> 02:20:10,360
Pookie.

3033
02:20:11,060 --> 02:20:12,360
I like her art.

3034
02:20:16,060 --> 02:20:17,880
She has a webtoon that I read.

3035
02:20:20,640 --> 02:20:21,500
That's so funny.

3036
02:20:21,540 --> 02:20:23,440
This is the last place I expected to see her.

3037
02:20:28,500 --> 02:20:29,380
For free?

3038
02:20:29,980 --> 02:20:30,800
What's for free?

3039
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:33,280
Cute.

3040
02:20:34,260 --> 02:20:34,960
Looks like.

3041
02:20:35,060 --> 02:20:37,620
Looks like a Cinderella girl's.

3042
02:20:37,940 --> 02:20:38,380
Like.

3043
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:39,440

3044
02:20:39,620 --> 02:20:40,080
You know?

3045
02:20:45,320 --> 02:20:46,320
A ghost.

3046
02:20:47,940 --> 02:20:48,840
Me too.

3047
02:20:50,600 --> 02:20:51,620
Oh gosh.

3048
02:20:51,700 --> 02:20:52,580
That guy scared me again.

3049
02:20:53,420 --> 02:20:54,100
Oh.

3050
02:20:54,660 --> 02:20:54,700
Oh.

3051
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:56,680
Oh.

3052
02:20:58,280 --> 02:20:58,960
Oh.

3053
02:20:59,560 --> 02:21:00,240
Oh.

3054
02:21:00,660 --> 02:21:01,340
Oh.

3055
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:05,980
This guy's got nothing.

3056
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:09,140
This is economy class.

3057
02:21:09,340 --> 02:21:11,500
All these people affording these bentos.

3058
02:21:11,500 --> 02:21:12,240
They're crazy.

3059
02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:13,780
Cute.

3060
02:21:17,160 --> 02:21:17,500
Fun.

3061
02:21:18,120 --> 02:21:19,700
I like the eye patch.

3062
02:21:21,540 --> 02:21:22,700
Cute.

3063
02:21:24,120 --> 02:21:25,040
A mama.

3064
02:21:25,360 --> 02:21:26,020
Oh.

3065
02:21:26,900 --> 02:21:28,060
Cute.

3066
02:21:29,940 --> 02:21:33,060
The most dangerous sniper.

3067
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:43,100
The most dangerous sniper.

3068
02:21:43,100 --> 02:21:43,240
The most dangerous sniper.

3069
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:43,920
The most dangerous bento.

3070
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:44,980
The most dangerous bento.

3071
02:21:44,980 --> 02:21:45,020
Yeah.

3072
02:21:47,300 --> 02:21:49,860
These people just getting their normal ass faces.

3073
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:50,520
Like.

3074
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:52,560
At some reason it's like totally normal.

3075
02:21:52,660 --> 02:21:54,120
To see the Vtubers at this point.

3076
02:21:54,240 --> 02:21:57,360
Because Vtubers are in like every single one of these games.

3077
02:21:57,620 --> 02:21:59,080
But seeing like the people.

3078
02:21:59,220 --> 02:22:00,580
With just their normal photo.

3079
02:22:00,620 --> 02:22:03,800
Like their facebook pics are just so funny to me.

3080
02:22:03,980 --> 02:22:05,020
I don't know why.

3081
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:06,400
It's like.

3082
02:22:07,020 --> 02:22:07,600
It's just.

3083
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:11,940
It's just, it takes me out of like the immersion.

3084
02:22:12,180 --> 02:22:13,160
For some reason.

3085
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:13,280
What is it?

3086
02:22:13,340 --> 02:22:14,020
I don't know why.

3087
02:22:15,460 --> 02:22:16,080
Oh!

3088
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:37,400
There she is!

3089
02:22:39,220 --> 02:22:40,180
There's Ollie.

3090
02:22:43,480 --> 02:22:44,520
That's not Ollie.

3091
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:57,160
That's all of them after this.

3092
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:58,480
Cute.

3093
02:22:59,620 --> 02:23:00,580
Very rosy.

3094
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:01,440
Lemonade!

3095
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:02,560
Oh, nope.

3096
02:23:02,660 --> 02:23:03,160
Just kidding.

3097
02:23:03,220 --> 02:23:03,420
Sorry.

3098
02:23:03,980 --> 02:23:05,260
I almost missed some people.

3099
02:23:06,560 --> 02:23:07,040
Hello.

3100
02:23:07,440 --> 02:23:08,680
Is this a horror?

3101
02:23:10,420 --> 02:23:11,380
Horror bento.

3102
02:23:11,420 --> 02:23:12,600
What could be in there?

3103
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:14,580
Aizuki.

3104
02:23:15,020 --> 02:23:16,280
Makes me want some.

3105
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:18,900
Oh, wait.

3106
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:19,760
We did see this guy.

3107
02:23:23,500 --> 02:23:25,560
Is he the old man?

3108
02:23:25,640 --> 02:23:26,320
You think?

3109
02:23:28,820 --> 02:23:32,440
Is he the old man that we talked to earlier?

3110
02:23:34,360 --> 02:23:34,940
Maybe.

3111
02:23:36,280 --> 02:23:36,860
Cat.

3112
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:39,540
Okay.

3113
02:23:40,260 --> 02:23:41,120
Very good.

3114
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:43,140
Glad we could see him.

3115
02:23:43,160 --> 02:23:43,940
See all of those.

3116
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:46,780
He's running.

3117
02:23:46,940 --> 02:23:48,760
Oh, is he running for parliament?

3118
02:23:49,040 --> 02:23:49,420
Oh my gosh.

3119
02:23:49,420 --> 02:23:49,940
I was gonna say.

3120
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:55,660
That'd be so crazy to see an actual politician in my video game.

3121
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:56,020
Oh, wait.

3122
02:23:56,060 --> 02:23:56,720
We missed these ones.

3123
02:23:56,760 --> 02:23:57,020
I think.

3124
02:23:59,740 --> 02:24:00,260
Oh, no.

3125
02:24:00,300 --> 02:24:00,640
Just kidding.

3126
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:02,160
I remember the rainbow eyes.

3127
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:03,400
Okay.

3128
02:24:06,500 --> 02:24:07,760
You on the next one.

3129
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:08,140
Okay.

3130
02:24:08,340 --> 02:24:09,360
I will...

3131
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:10,640
I will...

3132
02:24:10,640 --> 02:24:11,360
I will...

3133
02:24:11,360 --> 02:24:12,540
I will...

3134
02:24:12,540 --> 02:24:14,460
Subscribe to the Patreon.

3135
02:24:16,620 --> 02:24:17,120
Like...

3136
02:24:18,100 --> 02:24:20,660
Well, I was gonna say right after this, but I'm starving.

3137
02:24:20,820 --> 02:24:22,800
My stomach is like...

3138
02:24:22,800 --> 02:24:24,760
I'm hungry ghost right now.

3139
02:24:24,800 --> 02:24:25,480
I'm hungry ghost.

3140
02:24:27,020 --> 02:24:29,980
So, I'm gonna go haunt some of your guys' houses.

3141
02:24:30,060 --> 02:24:35,200
Please leave out some snacks for me to nibble on.

3142
02:24:35,360 --> 02:24:36,740
I'm gonna house hop.

3143
02:24:36,740 --> 02:24:38,500
And, uh, you know.

3144
02:24:38,760 --> 02:24:39,820
Just some, like...

3145
02:24:39,820 --> 02:24:41,940
Some offerings for me.

3146
02:24:42,320 --> 02:24:43,240
No, not cookies.

3147
02:24:43,360 --> 02:24:46,460
I'm looking for something with a little bit more substance, probably.

3148
02:24:47,220 --> 02:24:48,700
Yeah, I would like some offerings.

3149
02:24:49,980 --> 02:24:50,380
Um...

3150
02:24:50,380 --> 02:24:50,700
Sorry.

3151
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:55,420
I would talk afterwards, but my stomach is actually getting upset.

3152
02:24:55,500 --> 02:24:58,560
I can't tell if it's upset because I'm hungry or if it's upset.

3153
02:24:59,000 --> 02:24:59,400
Upset.

3154
02:24:59,660 --> 02:25:00,380
I don't know.

3155
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:01,320
Tummy heart.

3156
02:25:01,580 --> 02:25:02,300
I'm so sorry.

3157
02:25:03,400 --> 02:25:04,160
A sandwich.

3158
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:04,340
Yeah!

3159
02:25:04,440 --> 02:25:05,540
A sandwich would be perfect.

3160
02:25:05,640 --> 02:25:06,080
Oh my gosh.

3161
02:25:06,740 --> 02:25:08,860
When I was in Japan, I lived off of eggy sandwiches.

3162
02:25:09,300 --> 02:25:10,500
I love the ones...

3163
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:14,380
Okay, there would be, like, egg sandwiches with cucumber and ham in them.

3164
02:25:15,300 --> 02:25:16,100
It was...

3165
02:25:16,100 --> 02:25:16,980
Oh my gosh.

3166
02:25:17,020 --> 02:25:18,060
It was so delicious.

3167
02:25:18,400 --> 02:25:19,780
Because it was just the right amount.

3168
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:20,800
I don't like a lot of ham.

3169
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:23,600
It was just the right amount of ham for me.

3170
02:25:23,860 --> 02:25:26,200
And I like a lot of cucumber, unfortunately.

3171
02:25:26,300 --> 02:25:27,580
It was kind of slacking.

3172
02:25:27,660 --> 02:25:28,180
I'll be honest.

3173
02:25:28,220 --> 02:25:31,040
Kind of slacking on the...

3174
02:25:32,460 --> 02:25:33,260
On the...

3175
02:25:35,740 --> 02:25:36,140
Cucumber.

3176
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:36,660
But that's okay.

3177
02:25:36,740 --> 02:25:38,560
I could still taste it a little bit.

3178
02:25:39,820 --> 02:25:41,940
I have left out some durian for you.

3179
02:25:45,380 --> 02:25:47,900
Maybe I won't go to your house, kinky cadaver.

3180
02:25:48,140 --> 02:25:49,400
I just had some spaghetti.

3181
02:25:49,420 --> 02:25:50,140
No reason.

3182
02:25:50,560 --> 02:25:51,680
What do you mean, no reason?

3183
02:25:52,680 --> 02:25:58,080
It was super obvious, but the plant car was the coolest thing I've seen in these types of games.

3184
02:25:58,200 --> 02:25:58,360
Yeah!

3185
02:25:58,580 --> 02:25:59,680
It was really cool.

3186
02:25:59,840 --> 02:26:00,680
It, like, felt...

3187
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:01,760
Oh my gosh.

3188
02:26:01,780 --> 02:26:03,200
You guys know that game Tokyo Jungle?

3189
02:26:04,020 --> 02:26:05,800
It felt very much like that.

3190
02:26:06,160 --> 02:26:07,700
Maybe I can play that.

3191
02:26:08,140 --> 02:26:08,880
Tokyo Jungle.

3192
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:09,800
That's a fun game.

3193
02:26:10,280 --> 02:26:13,020
I don't know if I've seen anyone ever stream that one.

3194
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:14,040
It's kind of older, though.

3195
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:16,640
Wild Pomeranians.

3196
02:26:16,680 --> 02:26:16,920
Yeah!

3197
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:18,420
Give me Tokyo Jungle.

3198
02:26:18,560 --> 02:26:19,220
Oh, gosh.

3199
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:19,600
My stomach.

3200
02:26:19,940 --> 02:26:20,380
Okay.

3201
02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:23,240
It just all of a sudden started hurting.

3202
02:26:23,480 --> 02:26:25,180
So, luckily I was able to get through the game.

3203
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:28,280
I was hungry earlier, but now it's starting to hurt.

3204
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:30,880
So, I'm going to end it early.

3205
02:26:30,880 --> 02:26:31,960
I'm sorry, guys.

3206
02:26:32,060 --> 02:26:33,980
I don't mean to end it early, but I'm going to go.

3207
02:26:34,060 --> 02:26:34,820
I'm going to call it here.

3208
02:26:34,960 --> 02:26:38,360
Thank you guys for hanging out with me today!

3209
02:26:39,700 --> 02:26:40,100
And...

3210
02:26:40,820 --> 02:26:41,220
Yeah!

3211
02:26:43,700 --> 02:26:44,520
Thanks for the stream.

3212
02:26:44,640 --> 02:26:45,000
Thank you!

3213
02:26:45,140 --> 02:26:46,660
Go eat, ghost girl.

3214
02:26:46,760 --> 02:26:47,260
I will.

3215
02:26:48,900 --> 02:26:49,600
Hungry ghost.

3216
02:26:50,060 --> 02:26:50,760
Hungry ghost.

3217
02:26:51,800 --> 02:26:52,200
Otsuminto!

3218
02:26:54,220 --> 02:26:54,620
Otsuminto!

3219
02:26:54,800 --> 02:26:55,900
I will see you guys.

3220
02:26:56,080 --> 02:26:56,720
I'm so sorry.

3221
02:26:56,840 --> 02:26:57,320
Oh my gosh.

3222
02:26:57,400 --> 02:27:06,420
I did totally intend on sticking around and talking, especially because this is only two and a half hours, but at least we got...

3223
02:27:06,420 --> 02:27:08,920
I assume we got all the endings.

3224
02:27:09,220 --> 02:27:09,600
Right?

3225
02:27:09,700 --> 02:27:11,700
I'm assuming that there's only two endings.

3226
02:27:12,630 --> 02:27:12,900
Right?

3227
02:27:13,400 --> 02:27:14,660
We got all of them.

3228
02:27:14,740 --> 02:27:15,480
I think.

3229
02:27:16,120 --> 02:27:16,840
It's okay.

3230
02:27:16,980 --> 02:27:18,480
Thank you guys for understanding.

3231
02:27:18,680 --> 02:27:19,860
I'm going to go get food.

3232
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:23,740
Otsuminto.

3233
02:27:23,900 --> 02:27:24,340
Otsuminto.

3234
02:27:26,540 --> 02:27:27,080
Yeah.

3235
02:27:27,340 --> 02:27:27,880
Yep.

3236
02:27:27,940 --> 02:27:28,760
Just two endings.

3237
02:27:29,860 --> 02:27:30,400
Oh!

3238
02:27:30,880 --> 02:27:31,640
I didn't get caught!

3239
02:27:33,660 --> 02:27:34,540
Oh no!

3240
02:27:36,380 --> 02:27:37,240
There's no more?

3241
02:27:43,780 --> 02:27:45,820
I can't tell what you guys are saying.

3242
02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:48,600
Cool.

3243
02:27:48,740 --> 02:27:49,640
Get out of here.

3244
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:50,020
Okay.

3245
02:27:50,060 --> 02:27:50,540
I'm leaving.

3246
02:27:50,740 --> 02:27:50,980
I'm leaving.

3247
02:27:51,140 --> 02:27:51,360
I'm leaving.

3248
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:52,240
Bye bye!

3249
02:27:52,640 --> 02:27:53,080
Otsuminto!

3250
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:54,360
Otsuminto.

3251
02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:55,080
Otsuminto.

3252
02:27:55,240 --> 02:27:55,680
Otsuminto.

3253
02:27:56,300 --> 02:27:56,740
Otsuminto.

3254
02:27:56,940 --> 02:27:57,380
Otsuminto.

3255
02:27:57,540 --> 02:27:58,100
Hold on.

3256
02:27:58,200 --> 02:27:59,280
I'm going to wave to you guys.

3257
02:27:59,480 --> 02:27:59,800
Otsu.

3258
02:28:00,080 --> 02:28:00,520
Otsu.

3259
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:00,940
Otsu.

3260
02:28:02,260 --> 02:28:02,700
Otsuminto.

3261
02:28:02,700 --> 02:28:03,140
Otsu.

3262
02:28:03,620 --> 02:28:04,100
Otsuminto.

3263
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:05,040
Otsuminto.

3264
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:05,800
Otsuminto.

3265
02:28:06,080 --> 02:28:06,560
Otsuminto.

3266
02:28:06,700 --> 02:28:07,180
Otsuminto.

3267
02:28:07,440 --> 02:28:07,920
Otsuminto.

3268
02:28:08,040 --> 02:28:08,040
Otsuminto.

3269
02:28:08,580 --> 02:28:09,060
Otsuminto.

3270
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:09,600
Otsuminto.

3271
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:09,600
Otsuminto.

3272
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:09,980
Bye bye!

3273
02:28:10,220 --> 02:28:10,780
Bye bye!

3274
02:28:10,840 --> 02:28:11,160
Bye bye!

3275
02:28:11,160 --> 02:28:11,560
Bye bye!

3276
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:35,620
Thank you for all the...

3277
02:28:35,620 --> 02:28:38,890
Thank you guys!

3278
02:28:39,450 --> 02:28:40,010
Thank you!

3279
02:28:40,010 --> 02:28:40,210
Thank you!

3280
02:28:40,250 --> 02:28:40,630
Thank you!

3281
02:28:40,630 --> 02:28:43,270
Thank you for the stream!

3282
02:28:43,530 --> 02:28:45,310
You want this tub of chocolate mint ice cream?

3283
02:28:45,570 --> 02:28:46,050
Sure!

3284
02:28:47,730 --> 02:28:50,370
At least the tummy hort can't kill you again!

3285
02:28:50,370 --> 02:28:50,970
So true!

3286
02:28:51,290 --> 02:28:52,350
Thanks for the stream!

3287
02:28:52,390 --> 02:28:52,710
Thank you!

3288
02:28:54,270 --> 02:28:55,530
Thank you for the stream!

3289
02:28:55,530 --> 02:28:55,530
Thank you!

3290
02:28:55,530 --> 02:28:55,670
Thank you for the stream!

3291
02:28:56,590 --> 02:28:57,090
Thank you for the stream!

3292
02:28:57,770 --> 02:28:58,330
Okay.

3293
02:28:59,070 --> 02:28:59,710
Okay.

3294
02:29:00,590 --> 02:29:01,010
Okay.

3295
02:29:05,280 --> 02:29:05,280
Okay.

3296
02:29:09,550 --> 02:29:10,190
Otsuminto.

3297
02:29:10,870 --> 02:29:12,250
See you later.

3298
02:29:12,570 --> 02:29:13,530
See you.

3299
02:29:14,030 --> 02:29:15,070
When I see you.

3300
02:29:15,210 --> 02:29:16,790
Next stream is...

3301
02:29:18,450 --> 02:29:19,090
Yippee!

3302
02:29:21,070 --> 02:29:22,030
Bye bye!
