Hi.

5
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,300
I'm eating right now.

6
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,740
Hold on.

7
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,690
One more little noodle.

Um...

12
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,440
Sorry.

13
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,960
I didn't know you could see that.

14
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,840
Why is there a box on my face?

15
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,700
And the karaoke box over the...

16
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,520
Stop it!

17
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,140
Stop looking!

18
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,420
Actually, I think I need to do the...

19
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:30,960
You know what?

20
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,160
Screw you guys.

21
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,990
Are we ready to be nice now?

22
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,330
Are we ready?

23
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,970
Ta party!

24
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,370

00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,290
I don't know what to sing at all!

29
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,770
I have like no list at all.

30
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,950
We're singing whatever we want, baby.

31
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,550
Some things, if they're not on Karofan, I can probably find
them on YouTube, so.

32
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,690

the morning hour she calls me.

42
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,740
The radio reminds me of my home far away.

43
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:44,040
Driving down the road, I get a feeling that I should have
been home yesterday.

44
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,240
Yesterday.

45
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,440

To the left, to the left.

59
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,080
Everything you own in a box to the left.

60
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,300
Audio's perfect, audio's good, sounds great.

61
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,800
Yee-ha, partner.

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,760

Can you sing in Kermit voice?

65
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,120
What would you want me to sing in Kermit voice?

66
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,520
Healing my soul.

67
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,900
I'm going to move you guys over a little bit.

68
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,720
Actually, I'm going to move you guys right here.

69
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:45,660
Yay.

70
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,100
Yep.

71
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:46,460
Yep.

72
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,100
Yep.

73
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,500
Yep.

74
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,960
And also, I'm going to block how many people are watching.

75
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,120
I usually do, but the way I had it before.

76
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,740
California girls.

77
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:16,980
California girls by Katie Perry as sung by Kermit Voice

78
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:37,820
Okay, um, okay, I think you can do this Greetings, loved
ones Greetings, let's take a drink I know a place where the

79
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,180
grass is really greener.

80
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,020
Warm, wet and wild.

81
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:55,350
There must be something sipping gin and juice, laying
underneath the palm trees.

82
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:02,950
The boys break their necks, try to creep a little sneak
peek.

83
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:12,270
Travel the world, but nothing comes close to the golden
coast.

84
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,770
Once you party with Frog Bird, you'll be falling in love.

85
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,410
Oh, oh, oh.

86
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,530
California Frogs were unforgettable.

87
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,350
Daisy Duke's bikinis on top.

88
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,490
Sun-kissed skins so hot will melt your popsicle.

89
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,430
Oh, oh, oh.

90
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,790
Outlit cornea frogs, we're undeniable, fine, fresh, fierce.

91
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,790
We got it on luck.

92
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,470
West Coast represent, put your hands up.

93
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,390
Beach, why is it so bright?

94
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,650
We don't mind sand in our stilettos.

95
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,710
We freak in my Jeep.

96
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,130
Snoop doggie dog on the stereo.

97
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,650
Oh, oh, you could travel the world.

98
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,030
But nothing comes close to the golden coast.

99
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:19,070
Once you party with frog birds, you'll be falling in love.

100
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,950
California frogs were unforgettable.

101
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,790
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top.

102
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,910
Sun kiss getting so hot, we'll melt your popsicle.

103
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,610
Oh, oh, oh.

104
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,830
California girls, we're on the night.

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:48,610

ready, wait, no,

107
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:06,780
it's my beaches, though, because I'm such a sweet, sure,
it's a neat family,

108
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:19,060
when it's beach in Palm Springs, summertime is everything,
homeboys banging out, all that hanging out.

109
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,360
Bikinis, wikinis, martinis, no weenies, just the king and
the queenie.

110
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,960
Katie, my lady, look here.

111
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,780
Oh, look here, baby, I'm all up on you because you represent
in California.

112
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,940
Daisy Duke's bikinis on top.

113
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,400
Sun-kissed skin so hot.

114
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,980
We'll melt your popsicle.

115
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,440
Oh, oh, oh.

116
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,600
California girls were undeniable.

117
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,240
Fine, fresh, fierce.

118
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,380
We got it.

119
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,100
I'm back.

120
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,520
West Coast for a person.

121
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,020
Now put your head.

122
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,470
There's only a few children who would do what we do.

123
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,030
I think I lost.

124
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,850
I think I got lost in the sauce there a little bit.

125
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,830
No, I messed up the best part.

126
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:31,850
I'm so sorry.

127
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,920
One second.

128
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,600
I think I'm going to turn the glow down just a little bit.

129
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,380
So you guys don't keep getting flashbangs when it...

00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,320
Thank you for karaoke on my birthday.

135
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,140
Happy birthday, Casey Raptor!

136
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,140
Happy birthday to you.

137
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,720
Happy birthday to you.

138
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,020
Happy birthday, Casey Raptor.

139
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,280
Happy birthday to you.

140
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:54,660
Okay.

141
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,540
Maybe cloudy and rainy out, but mint singing is all the
sunshine I need for my song.

142
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,480
What else can we do?

143
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,320
Oh my gosh, the world is our oyster.

144
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,640
We could sing whatever we want.

145
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,780
Trooper by Iron Maiden.

146
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,700
I'm sorry I don't know it well enough.

147
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,360
Please don't spam, though.

148
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,960
If you want me to sing a song, if you spam it, it's going to
be even less likely.

149
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,700
I sing it.

150
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,980
You're a stream.

151
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:23,900
Oh!

152
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,020

153
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,840
Sorry, the notives.

154
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,140
This is the fat and ready content.

155
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,460
Oh, that's so funny.

156
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,240
Let's see.

157
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,120
The title of the stream is English song.

158
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,580

I'm saying Snow Halation has about five English words.

164
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,160
Now I could sing the Triple Q version.

165
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,980

166
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,440

be a buzz.

175
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,700
Like I had last week, I must stay deep because talk is
cheap.

176
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,660
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra, and Rita.

177
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,420
And as I continue, you know they're getting sweeter.

178
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,740
So what can I do?

179
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,500
I don't know how the song is turning.

180
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,840
It's just like a sport.

181
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,200
Anything's right.

182
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,460
It's all good.

183
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,760
Let me jump in and send in the trumpet.

Wait, you makes me your man.

192
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,210
Jump up and down and move it all around.

193
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,970
Shake your head to the sound, put your hands on the ground.

194
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,830
Take one step left and one step right.

195
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,630
One to the front and one to the side.

196
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:54,930
Clap your hands one.

197
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,210

00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,930
Dolly Parton.

219
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,460
I think I remember this one.

220
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,340
I think I.

221
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,520
Fleetwood Mac.

222
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,980
Oh yeah, we can do some later.

223
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,360
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene.

224
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,010
Love you, please don't take my Mac.

225
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:09,730
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, please don't take thank you
just because you can.

226
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:20,290
Your beauty is beyond compare with flaming locks of all
burnt hair with ivory skin and eyes of emerald green.

227
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:30,910
Your smile's like a breath of spring, your voice is soft
like some And I cannot compete with you, Jolene.

228
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,270
He talks about you in his sleep.

229
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:42,050
There's nothing I can do to keep from crying when he calls
your name, Jolene.

230
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:52,030
And I can easily understand how you could easily take my
man, but you don't know what he means to me.

231
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,050
Jolene.

232
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,470
Jolene.

233
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:05,510
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, I'm begging of you, please don't
take my man.

234
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:16,950
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, please don't take him just
because you can.

235
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:24,090
You could have your choice of men, but I could never love
again.

236
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,510
He's the only one for me.

237
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,890
Is that a JoJo reference?

238
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,170
Actually, the other way around.

239
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:37,430
My happiness depends on you and whatever you decide to do.

240
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,270
Jolene.

241
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,490
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene.

242
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,770
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man.

243
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,210
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene.

244
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:03,250
Jolene, please don't take him even though you can.

245
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,170
Jolene.

246
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,720
Damn, hit it girl.

247
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,890
That's a Dolly Parton reference.

248
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:25,230
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene.

249
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:27,150
Oops.

250
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:28,730
Jolene.

251
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,350
From JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

252
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,850
This too is Yuri.

253
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:49,190
I mean, Jolene, she sounds like, I don't know, I can't tell
if she's like, um, if she's gonna take the, if she's like

254
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,130
interested in the guy or if she's like, you know, Moana!

255
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,750
I was just thinking I want to sing Disney songs.

256
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,310
Um, oh my god, I sang this all the time when I was in Japan.

257
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:11,170
I can't tell if she's like trying to take her take the guy
or if she's just like no I know you can do it but like

258
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:17,750
please don't but also this guy sounds like a jerk he's the
one who's like saying her name in his sleep what a weirdo

259
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:32,810
what a weirdo oh I don't remember which one it is if it's
the original one or if it's the I'm gonna try this one if

260
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:38,290
it's the wrong one if it's like the, if it's like the poppy
version, I'll change.

261
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,510
Break stuff by Limp Biscuit.

262
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,090
Patience.

263
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,510
Patience.

264
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:59,160
I've been staring at the edge of the water, long as I can
remember.

265
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,220
Never really knowing why.

266
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:14,160
I wish I could be the perfect But I come back to the water,
no matter how hard I try.

267
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:24,500
Every turn I take, every trail I track, every path I make,
every road leads back to the place I know where I cannot go,

268
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,060
where I long to be.

269
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,020
See the line where the sky meets the sea, it calls me.

270
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,980
And no one knows how far it goes.

271
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:51,660
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me One day
I'll know If I go, there's just no telling how far I'll go I

272
00:26:51,660 --> 00:27:07,540
know everybody on this island Seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design I know everybody on this island on

273
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:18,860
this island so maybe i can roll with mine i can lead with
pride i can make us strong i'll be satisfied if i play along

274
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:32,420
but the voice inside sings a different song what is wrong
with me see the light as it shines on the sea it's blinding

275
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:47,780
but no one knows how deep it goes And it seems like it's
calling out to me, so come find me, and let me know what's

276
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,240
beyond that line, will I cross that line?

277
00:27:50,380 --> 00:28:01,240
See the line where the sky meets the sea, it calls me, and
no one knows how far it goes.

278
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:13,140
If the wind and my sail on the sea stays behind me One day
I'll know how far I'll go

279
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:29,240
Wow Wow This song makes me tear up every time

280
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:43,700
Wow Makes me so emotional how far I'll go because I relate
to the lyrics so much I don't know it's hard to explain

281
00:28:47,580 --> 00:29:00,360
Disney Disney Disney what's another Disney Disney I won't
say I'm in love I won't say I'm in love boo-doo boom boom

282
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,000
wait well there's a longer version of the song I don't know
it though

283
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:25,390
if there's There's a price for rotten judgment I guess I've
already won that No man is worth the aggravation That's

284
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:33,550
ain't in history Been there, done that Don't you think
you're kidding He's the yours that ever do You try to keep

285
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:39,970
it hidden Honey, we can see Oh no We know how you feel

286
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:51,750
Oh, no chance, no way, I won't say it no, no Yes, oh, yes I,
why deny?

287
00:29:52,230 --> 00:30:07,110
Oh, it's too cliche, I won't say I'm in love I thought my
heart had learned its lesson It feels so good when you start

288
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:16,150
out My head is screaming, get a grip, girl Unless you're
dying to cry your heart out.

289
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,930
You keep on denying who you are and how you're feeling.

290
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,410
Baby, we're not buying harm.

291
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,010
We saw your hip was sealed.

292
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:28,670
Face it like a grown up when you're kind of honored that you
don't.

293
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,310
Cause, cause.

294
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:34,090
Oh, no chance, no way.

295
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,310
I won't say you don't know.

296
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,150
Give up, give and check the green.

297
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,370
You're in love.

298
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,050
You'll see who won't play.

299
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,390
I won't say I'm in love.

300
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:58,870
Your way off your face, I won't say it Get off my case, I
won't say it Girl, don't be proud, it's okay

So I think I'm gonna up the key.

Like a little, maybe two.

326
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,100
Let's see how it goes.

327
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:15,170
Save behind its windows and these parapets of stone Gazing
at the people down below me Oh, there's a little high about

328
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:26,410
somewhere Hold on Before the histories they show me That's
kind of low Light from the faces Knowing them as they will

329
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:32,130
never know me Maybe I do need to lower the key Hold on, I'm
going to lower the key They all just try singing it normal

330
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:51,910
Safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone Gazing
at the people down below me All my life I watch them as I

331
00:34:51,910 --> 00:35:03,590
hide up here alone Hungry for the history as they show me
All my life I memorize their faces Knowing them as they will

332
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:25,260
never know me I don't know how it feels as if it's not above
them but part of them and out there living in the sun give

333
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:49,060
me one day out there all I ask is one to hold forever out
there where they all live on What I'd give What I dare Just

334
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:55,140
to live But one day out there

335
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:08,540
Out there among the millers and the weavers and the wives
Through the roofs and cables I can see them Every day they

336
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:20,680
shout and scold and go about their lives Heathless of the
gift it is to be them If I was in their skin, I treasure

337
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,960
every instant.

338
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:31,720
Out there, strolling by the sun, taste of mourning.

339
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:39,400
Out there, like ordinary men who freely walk up.

340
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:59,160
Fell there just one day and then I swear I'll be content
With my share Won't resent, won't despair Hold and mend, I

341
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,180
won't care All has spent Why?

342
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,960
Oh God, hey, hello there

343
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:41,560

god oh I'm sorry my voice cracked in that one part I was so

00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,740
speaking of hell how about hellfire my way ahead of you

348
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:33,140
You know I am a righteous man of my virtue, I am justly
proud.

349
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:45,080
Beata Maria, you know I'm so much purer than the common
vulgar weak licentious crowd.

350
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:55,500
Then tell me, Maria, why I see her dancing there, why her
smoldering eyes still scorched my soul.

351
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:15,420
I feel her, I see her, the sun caught in her raven hair Is
blazing in me out of all control Like fire, hellfire, this

352
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:36,800
fire in my skin This burning desire is turning me to sin
it's not my fault I'm not to blame it is the gypsy girl the

353
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:50,040
witch who sent this flame it's not my fault if in God's plan
he made the devil so much stronger than a man protect me

354
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:59,220
Maria don't let this siren cast her spell don't let her fall
Fire, sear my flesh and bone.

355
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,140
Destroy Ismerelda!

356
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:09,500
And let her taste the fires of hell, or else let her be mine
and mine alone.

357
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,080
Minister Frollo, the gypsy has escaped.

358
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,560
Who are you?

359
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,700
Get out of my room.

360
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,440
She's nowhere in the cathedral.

361
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,160
No, what?

362
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,160
Oh my god.

363
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,100
But how?

364
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,440
Um, go get my girlfriend back.

365
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,520
I'll find her if I have to burn down all of Paris.

366
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,340
Hellfire, dark fire.

367
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,660
Now Gypsy, it's your turn.

368
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,880
Choose me your, your fire.

369
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,900
Be mine or you will burn.

370
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,540
God have mercy on her.

371
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,520
God have mercy on me.

372
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:12,580
But she will be mine or she will burn.

373
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,080
Yeah!

374
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,960

Are Hololive songs off-limits for legal reasons?

396
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,420
No, but...

397
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,980
Hold on, I'm also going to move my mic up.

398
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,420
Oh, setlist, thank you.

399
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,680

And Hellfire.

401
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,460
Boy, it's one word.

402
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,380
But a lot of the Hololive songs are in Japanese.

403
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,340
And this is...

404
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,740
This is in English.

405
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,580
This is in English.

406
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,200
Oh, Sparks?

407
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,060
Wait.

00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:49,770

409
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,650
Sparks Instrumental.

410
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,130

411
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:55,830
Wait, Kiara.

412
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,830
Oh my god!

413
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:00,430
Wait.

414
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,030
There is one.

415
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,590
Wait, it says karaoke for instrumental with lyrics.

416
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:08,130
Oh, I could.

417
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,460
Hmm.

418
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:13,800
you might be there.

419
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:14,380
Do you?

420
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,000
Do you?

421
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,600
I don't know if I could sing them well, but I'll try.

422
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,400
Maybe later.

423
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,840
Oh my gosh.

424
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,340
Okay, one more hunchback of Notre Dame song.

425
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:28,780
I'm sorry.

426
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,520
Wait, is it this one?

427
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,080
I'll do the shorter one.

428
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,180
I think it's the shorter one.

429
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:35,820
Danielle, welcome to membership.

430
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,740
And thank you guys for all the super chats, too.

432
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:40,040

We'll do more Disney.

435
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,860
Sorry, I'm a Disney fan.

436
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,500
I don't want to say the Disney adult, that's embarrassing,
right?

437
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:04,940
I don't know if you can hear me, or if you're even there.

438
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:12,060
I don't know if you will listen to a humble prayer.

439
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,420
They tell me I'm just an outcast.

440
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:27,060
I shouldn't speak to you Still I see your face and wonder
Were you once an outcast too?

441
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:50,590
God help the outcasts Hungry from work Show them the mercy
They don't find on earth The lost and forgotten They look to

442
00:45:50,590 --> 00:46:02,690
you still God help the outcast Or nobody will Why does it
sound like the ending version?

443
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:22,770
It sounds different I ask for nothing I can get by But I
know so many Less lucky than mine God help me outcast the

444
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:44,880

Listen, some are, some are not Why the few you seem to favor

445
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:17,320
Outcast the tatters the heart torn seeking an answer to why
they were born winds of misfortune have blown them about you

446
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:35,560

I was right.

464
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,020
Oh my god, I'm scared though.

465
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:31,840
I'm showing the screen.

466
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,040
It says bad word.

467
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,560
It's going to show up.

468
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,440
Fulamoko rivals.

469
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:40,840
That's the guy.

470
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,760
Who's Ken then?

471
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,060
Kevin Lamar is what Fulamoko called.

472
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,160
Wait, so his name is actually Kevin.

473
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:57,760
Kevin.

474
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,260
His actual name is Kendrick.

475
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,200
Oh.

476
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,340
Oh.

477
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:26,860
I see, I always thought they were two different people
because they were talking.

478
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,200
I've only seen, I've seen Kendrick Lamar and I've seen Kevin
Lamar.

479
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,180
I thought they were two different people.

480
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,900
I was like, wow, there's a lot of rappers with the last name
Lamar.

481
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:42,460
Wow.

482
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:46,020
I was like, wow, I didn't realize Lamar was such a popular
last name.

483
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,600
Is this a bit?

484
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,480
I'm never serious.

485
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,280
What are you talking about?

486
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,140
Of course this is a bit.

487
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,340
Things are the peak.

488
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,080
Your unique voice and personality elevates every song you
sing.

489
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,060
Sing your heart out.

490
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:03,920
Thank you!

491
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,360
Thank you, thank you!

492
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,500
Lamar isn't his last name.

493
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:12,300
What?

494
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,300
What does it mean?

495
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,360
Is it like a...

496
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,340
type of juice?

497
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,720
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

498

500
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,300
Oh, it's a middle name!

501
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,680
His last name is actually Duxworth.

502
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:43,760
No, it's not.

503
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,940
Kevin Lamar Duxworth.

504
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,120
Duxworth is a song by...

505
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,160
Oh, no, Kendrick Lamar.

506
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,300
Wait.

507
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,960
It is.

508
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,040
It's real.

509
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,840
It's real.

510
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:08,900
Okay.

512
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,300
Hold on.

513
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,920
Song by Kendrick Lamar taken from his album.

514
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,580
Dang.

515
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,580
The song's title is Lamar's actual last name.

516
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,760
What?

517
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,460
Who is Kendrick Lamar?

518
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:34,500
Oh.

519
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:36,720
He's just some guy.

520
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:48,980
I would also go No, he should have gone by Duck's word
That's so much cooler That's so much cooler

521
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,320
What do you mean some guy?

522
00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:02,880
I don't know, I'm just looking at him He just looks like a
guy Am I looking at the right person?

523
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:10,760
Oh wait, sorry, I typed Kevin Kendrick Lamar Actually, I'm
going to look up Kevin Duck's worth.

525
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:22,720
Okay.

526
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,320
It'd be kind of weird if he looked like a ghost.

527
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,360
I'm not expecting him to look like a ghost.

528
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,200
I'm just, I don't know.

529
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,480
I don't know what I'm expecting.

530
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,560

It would be if my Kabayoshi sang it.

534
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,700
Was it my first Supa worth it?

535
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,400

00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,750
Race cars, lasers, aeroplanes.

576
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:06,750

00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:28,930
The seaweed is always greater.

582
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:31,250
It's somebody else's lake.

583
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,050
You got me...

584
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:33,770

604
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,700
In my maid cafe.

605
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:48,410

606
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,000
You did it?

607
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,520

01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,460

609
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,100

01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,660
Just want to show you the silly video.

were trying to imagine music it's caramel dancing

630
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:40,940
the seaweed is always greener than somebody else's lake you
dream about going up there but that is a big mistake just

631
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:49,380
look at the world around you right here on the ocean floor
such wonderful things around you what more is you looking

632
01:02:49,380 --> 01:03:01,360
for under the sea under the sea darling it's better Down
where it's wetter, take it from me Up on the shore, they

633
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:11,040
work all day Out in the sun, they serve a wave While we
devote in full time to floating under the sea Ha ha ha ha ha

634
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:20,900
ha Toytle Down here all the fish is happy As all through the
waves they roll The fish on the land ain't happy They sad

635
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:27,140
cause they in their pool But fish in the pool is lucky They
aim for a worse of faith.

636
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:31,800
One day when the boss gets hungry, guess who got me on the
play?

637
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:32,480
Uh-oh!

638
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:33,820
Under the sea!

639
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,140
Under the sea!

640
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,640
Nobody beat us fries and eat us and fries.

641
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,620
What would we learn to food and cook under the sea?

642
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:46,680
We're off the hook!

643
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,240
We got no troubles.

644
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:49,480
Life is the bubbles!

645
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:50,440
Under the sea!

646
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:51,400
Under the sea!

647
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,760
Under the sea!

648
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,440
Since life is sweet here, we got the here naturally.

649
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:03,480
Even the surgeon and the ray, they get the urge and start to
play.

650
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,020
We've got the spirit, you've got to hear it under the sea.

651
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:13,800
The flute, the cart play the harp, the place play the bass
and bass sound and sharp.

652
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,260
The bass play the brass and drum play the tub.

653
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,640
The fluke is the duke of soul, yeah.

654
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:22,800
The ray he can play, the lings on the strings, the trout
rocking out, the black

655
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,400
that blowfish glow!

656
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,900
Oh yeah, I can't hear you.

657
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,960
Oh no!

658
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,260
...

659
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:42,620
...

660
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:42,760
...

661
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,760
Maybe a standing desk was a mistake.

662
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:48,640
...

663
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:52,920
Whoa!

664
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,520
Under the sea!

665
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:57,780
Under the sea!

666
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:09,040
When the sardine begin the begweenies, Music to me Wonder

667
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:18,620

668
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:25,320

hotter Under the water Yeah we in luck here Down in the muck

669
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,280

01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,080
Yeah!

671
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:35,710
That's me.

672
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:38,530
That was me the entire song, that little kid.

673
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:41,750
Even the, including the falling on the floor and everything.

674
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:50,630
Yay!

675
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:52,770
Be my guest.

676
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:57,330
Oh, be my, be our guest.

677
01:05:57,630 --> 01:05:58,130
Be our guest.

678
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:00,470
Got me grooving and laughing at work.

679
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:01,430
Didn't mute it.

680
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:05,230
This one.

681
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:07,590
Be our guest.

682
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:08,690
Be our guest.

683
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:11,010
Le Poisson?

684
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:13,890
Le Poisson, le Poisson.

685
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:15,570
Something, something, le Poisson.

686
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:23,670
My chérie, mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride and
greatest pleasure that we welcomed you tonight.

687
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:26,490
And now we invite you to relax.

688
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:33,070
Let us pull up a chair as the dining room presents, or
proudly presents, your dinner.

689
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:39,450
Be our guest, be our guest.

690
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:41,870
Put our service to the test.

691
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:46,590
Tie your napkin round your neck, Sherry, and we'll provide
the rest.

692
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:51,350
Soup de jour, hot de du bou, how do we only live to serve.

693
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,470
Try the great stuff, it's delicious.

694
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,790
Don't believe me, ask the dishes.

695
01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:58,290
They can sing, they can dance.

696
01:06:58,670 --> 01:07:04,110
After all, Miss, this is France, and a dinner here is never
second best.

697
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:09,450
Go on, unfold your men, you take a glance, and then you'll
be.

698
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:13,470
We are guests, we are guests, we are guests, be our guest.

699
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:17,810
Beer, arugue cheese souffle, pie and pudding on flambé.

700
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:21,890
We'll prepare and serve with flair a culinary cabaret.

701
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:26,430
You're alone and you're scared, but the banquet's all
prepared.

702
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:30,650
No one's gloomy or complaining while the flatware's
entertaining.

703
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:35,050
We tell jokes, I do tricks with my fellow candlesticks.

704
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:38,470
And it's all in perfect taste that you can bear.

705
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:47,870
Come on and list your glass You won your own free pass Don't
be our guest If you're stressed It's fine dining we suggest

706
01:07:47,870 --> 01:08:00,210
Be our guest Be our guest Be our guest Life is so unnerving
For a servant who's not serving He's not whole Without a

707
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:08,250
soul to wait upon It's just like me I'm a maid Ah the good
old days when we were useful I don't remember this part

708
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:12,070
Suddenly Those good old days are gone.

709
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:21,390
Ten years we've been rusting, needing so much more than
dusting, needing exercise, a chance to use our skills.

710
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:26,630
Most days we just lay around the castle.

711
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:31,230
Flabby fat and lazy, you walked in and oopsie daisy!

712
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:35,150
It's a guest, it's a guest, sake's alive, I'll be blessed.

713
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:38,910
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord I had the napkins
freshly pressed.

714
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:40,930
She'll want tea.

715
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,750
And my dear, that's fine with me.

716
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:47,070
While the cups do their soft shoe and I'll be glovin' I'll
be blah, blah, blah.

717
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:50,350
Heaven's sake is not a spot.

718
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:51,410
Clean it up.

719
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:53,790
We want the company impressed.

720
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:56,130
We've got a lot to do.

721
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:57,990
Is it one lump or two?

722
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:00,230
For you our guest, be our guest.

723
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:01,250
She's our guest.

724
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:02,290
Be our guest.

725
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:03,190
Be our guest.

726
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:03,970
Be our guest.

727
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,890
A command is your request.

728
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:09,450
It's been here since we've had anybody here and we're
outside.

729
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:11,790
Yes, with your meal, with your ease.

730
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:13,510
Yes, indeed, we aim to please.

731
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:18,110
While the candlelight's still glowing, let us help you.

732
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:20,990
We'll keep going.

733
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:24,950
Horse by course.

734
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:27,070
Oh, one by one.

735
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:30,250
Oh, till you shout, oh, no, I'm done.

736
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:33,810
Then we'll sing you off to sleep, you as they're jealous.

737
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:46,610
Tonight you'll prop your feet up, but for now, Let's eat up
be our guests, be our guests, be our guests Please be our...

738
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:47,010
Yeah!

739
01:09:57,010 --> 01:09:58,870
Why are you making me sing all these hard songs?

740
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:00,710
Why

741
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,480
are you making me sing all these hard songs?

742
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,680
Oh wait, uh, I missed, uh... Under the Sea And...

743
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:14,260
Be our guest, be our guest

744
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:24,700
Oh my gosh, the whole time I was just thinking of the ride
at Tokyo Disney.

745
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:25,620
So awesome.

746
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,160
You must be getting a workout tonight.

747
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:28,020
I am!

748
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:30,300
Take a break by singing Tequila.

749
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:32,560
You're so right.

750
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,780
What does Tequila taste like?

751
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:35,900
I've never had it before.

752
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:38,240
Rockbiter, thanks for the vibe gifted.

753
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:39,960
Thank you.

754
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,740
Thank you so much.

755
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:44,140
Is it this one?

756
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:51,230
It's spicy?

757
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:58,600
Oh no, I'm getting an inch in my body.

758
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,580
I'm getting an inch in my body.

759
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,080
Oh, I'm dancing.

760
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,060
Oh no!

761
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:57,980
Tequila.

762
01:12:58,820 --> 01:12:59,760
Who are you?

763
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,980
Careful not to strain your voice.

764
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:06,940
Tequila.

765
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:08,600
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo.

766
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,220
Buda, buda, buda, buda, buda.

767
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:15,580
Yay.

768
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:17,340
Okay.

769
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:23,320
I think I'm all warmed up now.

770
01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:53,250
It was to the lovers.

771
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,450
Sitting in the car, listening to blonde, falling for each
other.

772
01:13:58,030 --> 01:13:59,950
Pink and orange skies, feeling super childish.

773
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:00,870
No Donald Glover.

774
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:02,890
Miss call from my mother.

775
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:04,550
Like, where are you at tonight?

776
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:05,430
Got no alibi.

777
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:06,750
I was all alone.

778
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:22,430
With the love of my life She's got glitter for skin My
radiant beam in the night I don't need no light To see you

779
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:31,890
shine It's your golden hour

780
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:45,430
I In your golden

781
01:14:48,760 --> 01:15:00,340
Oh We were just two lovers Feet up on the dash, driving
nowhere fast Burning through the summer Radio on blast, make

782
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:07,220
the moment last She got solar power In its feel like ours
She knew she was the baddest, can you even imagine Falling

783
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:23,360
like I did for the love She's got glow on her face, a
glorious look in her eyes, My angel of light I was all alone

784
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:38,780
with the love of my life She's got glitter for skin, my
radiant beam in the night I don't need no light to see you

785
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:45,980
shine It's your golden

786
01:15:51,090 --> 01:16:01,320
You slow down down In your golden

787
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:25,510
I forget how long the intro or the outro is

788
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:11,060
I saw someone else request something earlier That I can sing
Actually I will do my best I will do my best to sing I think

789
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:14,580
I've only sung this song a lot I hate

790
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:39,440
to give you satisfaction asking how you're doing now How's
the castle built off people you pretend to care about Just

791
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:50,160
like you wanted Look at you, cool guy, you got it I see the
parties and the diamonds Sometimes when I close my eyes Six

792
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:59,480
months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise I
loved you truly You gotta laugh at the stupidity Cause I've

793
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:12,400
made some real big mistakes But you make the worst one look
fine I should have known it was strange You only come out at

794
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:25,860
night I used to think I was smart But you made me look so
naive The way you sold me for parts Is you sunk your teeth

795
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:35,280
into me Bloodsucker, fame fucker Bleeding me dry like a
goddamn bam

796
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:46,010
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad
news You called them crazy, God I hate the way I called them

797
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:47,650
crazy too You're so conniving?

798
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:51,330
How do you lie without flinching?

799
01:18:53,710 --> 01:19:00,330
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it, God knows I will never

800
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:14,210
will As girls your age know better, I've made some real big
mistakes But you make the worst ones look fine I should have

801
01:19:14,210 --> 01:19:28,050
known it was strange You only come out at night I used to
think I was smart But you made me look so naive The way you

802
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:41,910
sold me for parts To me, you're both bloodsucker, fame
fucker, bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire

803
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:52,660
You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?

804
01:19:52,780 --> 01:20:00,100
You can't love anyone, cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't Cause now

805
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:02,980
you think this kind of things I've never understood

806
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:20,540
I've made some real big mistakes But you make the worst one
look fine I should have known it was strange You only come

807
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:33,840
out at night I used to think I was smart But you made me
look so naive The way you sold me for parts As you sunk your

808
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:44,440
teeth into me Bloodsucker, rain fucker, bleeding me dry like
a goddamn vampire.

809
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:56,310
Yeah!

810
01:20:57,650 --> 01:21:00,570
This is Vampire by Olivia Rodrigo.

811
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:02,830
Wait, what did I sing after tequila?

812
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:05,110
Oh, Golden Hour?

813
01:21:06,910 --> 01:21:08,790
And then Vampire?

814
01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:10,290
English?

815
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:13,250
Olivia?

816
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:16,170
Not to be mistaken with the other?

817
01:21:17,230 --> 01:21:18,810
Glad you're back, vince.

818
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:22,150
Since you're not streaming on Friday, could I give an early
happy birthday?

819
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:23,850
Of course, Table Nome!

820
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:29,550
Happy birthday to you.

821
01:21:30,770 --> 01:21:33,030
Happy birthday to you.

822
01:21:33,730 --> 01:21:36,950
Happy birthday, dear Table Nome.

823
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:41,510
Happy birthday to you.

824
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:46,090
Happy birthday.

825
01:21:46,090 --> 01:21:46,970
Happy early birthday.

826
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:49,890
Sorry, I won't be here to celebrate on the actual day, but
just play this on the actual day.

827
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:50,950
Actually, don't even listen right now.

828
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:53,270
Play it back on the original day.

829
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:54,930
The original day.

830
01:21:55,730 --> 01:21:57,010
There's actually a song I want to sing.

831
01:21:57,130 --> 01:21:58,050
I've never sung it before.

832
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:00,290
Okay.

833
01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:01,130
Oh, wait.

834
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:03,250
Actually, there's a couple songs I wrote down.

835
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:04,750
I remember someone saying this earlier.

836
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:07,610
I've never sung this song before, so I'm kind of nervous.

837
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:10,250
I'll do my best.

838
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:12,970
Oh.

839
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:14,170
Oh.

840
01:22:16,090 --> 01:22:32,410
And you don't seem to understand A shame you seemed an
honest man And all the fears you hold so dear Will turn to

841
01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:44,590
whisper in your ear And you know what they say, I heard you
And you know that it means so much And you don't even feel a

842
01:22:44,590 --> 01:23:06,770
thing I am falling, I am fading I have lost it all And you
don't seem the lying kind A shame that I can read your mind

843
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:20,810
And all the things I bet I read there Candle-lit smile that
we both share And you know I don't mean to hurt you, but you

844
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:26,750
know that I mean so much, and you don't even feel the pain.

845
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:45,770
I am falling, I am fading, I am drowning, help me to
breathe, I am hurting, I have lost it all, I am losing.

846
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:48,090
Help me to breathe.

01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:08,270

I have

858
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:26,800
lost it all.

859
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,960
I am losing.

860
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:32,080
Help me to breathe.

873
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:04,200
I wonder if there's any Final Fantasy on here.

874
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:07,470
Final Fantasy.

875
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:17,030
I sung some a while ago before Oh my god they have sticky
that name But this song is in Jap Wait is it in Japanese?

876
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:22,450
I'm so curious I'm so curious right now I don't think I've
ever sung a Japanese song on Kairafan So I'm like

877
01:28:25,930 --> 01:28:28,310
There's not an English version of the song Is there?

878
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:38,240
I

879
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:49,560
think there's a I'm gonna skip forward I hope it's okay
Actually no This could be one Japanese song

880
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:53,680
Don't think twice.

881
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,040
The song is so hard.

882
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:56,920
I wonder if there's Uta Day Hikaru on here.

883
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:01,540
Oh, I'm thinking of Chikai.

884
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:02,520
Chikai is really hard.

885
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:04,800
But don't think twice I can maybe do if it's on here.

886
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:06,780
Oh, my God.

887
01:29:12,610 --> 01:29:13,330
Oh, my God.

888
01:29:33,310 --> 01:29:36,910
I can't get the timing.

889
01:29:36,910 --> 01:29:42,410
The sun is in the mirror.

890
01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:48,530
The moon is in the sky.

891
01:29:48,530 --> 01:30:02,890
The stars are flowing, and there are a lot of tears.

892
01:30:05,290 --> 01:30:05,530
The moon is in the sky.

893
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:38,350
I love you.

894
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:55,420

895
01:31:05,230 --> 01:31:06,030
so pretty.

896
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,740
Three, four, two, one.

897
01:31:50,620 --> 01:32:00,360
A lot of light is A lot of light The clouds are yellow And
tomorrow

898
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:23,950
The sky's

899
01:32:33,670 --> 01:32:53,590
Colble Mansion It's a cool mansion It's a great place to
take your hand, take your hand, take your hand, take your

900
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:56,970
hand, Oh, it's good.

901
01:32:56,970 --> 01:33:02,110
It's your city, It's your heart.

902
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:03,110
It's in the heart.

903
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:06,950
I love it.

904
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:10,470
Your face,

905
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:16,670
It's so hot.

906
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:20,830
It's great.

907
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:23,190
It's good.

908
01:33:57,730 --> 01:33:59,130
Oh my god!

909
01:33:59,630 --> 01:33:59,910
Yay!

910
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:01,030
I could see it!

911
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:04,790
Oh my god, so the beginning I was like trying to, I couldn't
remember so much of it.

912
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:07,530
But then it all came back to me all at once.

913
01:34:08,610 --> 01:34:11,910
I love Final Fantasy 10, 10, 2.

914
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:15,030
They do have Tata Hikaru on here.

915
01:34:19,610 --> 01:34:20,210
No,

916
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:25,680
they don't have...

917
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:27,860
What was Chikai called again?

918
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,800
They don't have it though.

919
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:33,820
No!

920
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:36,860
They do have simple and clean though.

921
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:41,480
A thousand words.

922
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,840
I don't know if they had it though.

923
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:46,440
Final Fantasy XII songs.

924
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:47,920
Let me see if they have a thousand words.

925
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:59,830
no sad do they have what was the other one what can i do for
you

926
01:35:04,590 --> 01:35:17,350

song that they have so sad so sad wait i wonder if we put in

it is it fixed itself

930
01:35:58,020 --> 01:36:00,820
Excuse me?

931
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:40,910
In you and I, there's a new land Angels in flight Wonk My
sanctuary, my sanctuary Where fears and lies melt away

932
01:36:56,270 --> 01:37:00,630
I don't think I can sing this one very well, but that's
okay.

933
01:37:03,170 --> 01:37:07,830
I want you fast asleep.

934
01:37:17,130 --> 01:37:42,470
means nothing in you and I there's a new land walk my
sanctuary my sanctuary where fears and lies melt away

935
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:50,110
Walk.

936
01:37:51,990 --> 01:37:53,370
What's left of me?

937
01:37:54,090 --> 01:37:55,970
What's left of me?

938
01:37:56,890 --> 01:37:58,890
What's left of me?

939
01:37:59,050 --> 01:37:59,050
Oh,

940
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,360
it's a battleground.

941
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:05,520
Sorry.

942
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:07,420
Walk.

943
01:38:14,030 --> 01:38:17,010
It's so cool that they have the lyrics actually backwards.

944
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:17,990
What?

945
01:38:18,330 --> 01:38:19,330
That's so awesome.

946
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:22,170
I forgot how hard the song goes.

947
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:37,230
You show me how to see that nothing is whole and nothing is
broken.

948
01:38:40,670 --> 01:38:45,310
And you and I, there's a new land.

949
01:38:52,330 --> 01:39:02,310
My sanctuary, my sanctuary, where fears and lies melt away.

950
01:39:06,630 --> 01:39:08,990
You've been here for a while.

951
01:39:09,970 --> 01:39:16,270
What's left of me, what's left of me now.

952
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:25,240
My fears, my lies.

953
01:39:57,730 --> 01:39:59,810
This song is so hard to sing.

954
01:40:02,630 --> 01:40:05,850
I believe that there are just some songs that Uta the Hikaru
can only sing.

955
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:08,430
Wonk.

956
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:09,670
Yay.

957
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:11,750
Request Eyes on Me from Final Fantasy 8.

958
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:13,710
I can probably find it somewhere.

959
01:40:16,150 --> 01:40:17,330
I will find it.

960
01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:17,830
Let's see.

961
01:40:18,650 --> 01:40:20,090
I have to go to YouTube, though.

962
01:40:21,450 --> 01:40:22,470
I'm pretty sure I did.

963
01:40:22,630 --> 01:40:23,630
Eyes on me, though.

964
01:40:24,150 --> 01:40:25,430
Eyes on me.

965
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:28,790
Instrumenta.

966
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:33,650
Is there a...

967
01:40:33,650 --> 01:40:34,150
Oh, here we go.

968
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:36,410
I think I did this one before.

969
01:40:39,850 --> 01:40:41,390
Sorry, you'll just have to see...

970
01:40:41,390 --> 01:40:42,210
You'll just see...

971
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:43,950
You'll just see Caravan, but nothing else.

972
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:51,260
Nothing moving.

973
01:41:16,530 --> 01:41:39,730
Whenever I sang my songs On the stage, on my own Whenever
said my words Wishing they would be heard I saw you smiling

974
01:41:39,730 --> 01:42:01,310
at me Was it real or just my fantasy You'd always be there
in the corner Of this tiny little bar My last night here for

975
01:42:01,310 --> 01:42:25,570
you Same old songs, just once more My last night here with
you Maybe yes, maybe no I kind of liked it your way How you

976
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:50,570
shyly placed your eyes on me But did you ever know that I
had mine on you Darling so there you are with that look on

977
01:42:50,570 --> 01:43:16,650
your face as if you're never heard as if you're never down I
be the one for you Who pinches you softly But sure If round

978
01:43:16,650 --> 01:43:25,050
is shown then I will know that You are no dreamer

979
01:43:52,260 --> 01:44:17,200
So let me come to you Close as I want to be Close enough for
me To feel your heart beating fast And stay there as I

980
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:35,480
whisper How I loved your peaceful eyes on me Did you ever
know that I had mine on you?

981
01:44:36,940 --> 01:45:00,160
Darling, so share with me your love if you have enough, your
tears if you're holding back, that's what it is how can i

982
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:19,180
let you know i'm more than the dress and the voice just
reach me out then you will know that you are not dreaming

983
01:45:19,180 --> 01:45:42,800
Darling, so there you are With that look on your face As if
you're never heard As if you're never down Shall I be the

984
01:45:42,800 --> 01:46:05,640

It's not, it is on Kara Fun, but I want to show you,
actually maybe I should just do the Kara Fun version.

988
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:52,080
Maybe I should do, but it's like, it'll ruin the mood, I
think.

989
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:56,200
Okay, I'm going to sing it, and then I'm going to show you
the Kara Fun version.

990
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:00,640
I'm going to sing it, and then I'm going to show you the
Kara Fun version, because it's so funny.

991
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:02,640
Okay, because I want you to hear it.

992
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:06,800
I, I don't want you to hear it and like, or see the lyrics
and then be like, what the hell?

993
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:09,580
And then I sing it and you're like, wait, it's already
ruined.

Okay.

995

Sorry.

1000
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:24,900
They had an intro on the YouTube one.

Holy moly.

1002
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:27,300
Oh my God.

1003
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,260
I'm so sorry.

1004
01:47:28,580 --> 01:47:29,900
My, I'm so sorry.

1005
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:32,540
That hurt me as much as it hurt you guys probably.

1006
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:36,460
I'm so sorry.

1007
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:38,240
I'm so sorry.

1008
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:39,440
Oof.

1009
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:41,120
Okay.

1010
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:43,960
Oh, thank God.

1011
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:46,160
It played it again, but I turned it off.

1012
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:46,620
Ah!

1013
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:47,460
God, sorry.

1014
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:49,000
You can't hear it, but I can.

1015
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:50,000
Shut up!

1016
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:51,360
Oh, my God.

1017
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:52,000
Okay.

1018
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:52,720
Holy.

1019
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,860
It's so loud even for me.

1020
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:56,360
Okay.

1021
01:47:59,440 --> 01:47:59,920
Okay.

1022
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:01,180
Okay.

1023
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:02,480
Okay, I'm going to say...

1024
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:10,220
is like so not that type of song either so it's funny oh you
could hear it a little bit

1025
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:36,160
days and sometimes as if they'll never end sun digs heels to
haunt you but after sunlit days one thing stays the same

1026
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:38,540
rises the moon

1027
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:59,320
Days fade into a watercolor blur Memories swim and haunt you
But look into the lake, shimmering like smoke, rises the

1028
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:25,310
moon Close your weary eyes I promise you that soon the
autumn comes to darken Fading summer skies Breathe, breathe

1029
01:49:27,390 --> 01:49:48,510
Breathe Days pull you down just like a sinking ship Floating
is getting harder But tread the water child and know that

1030
01:49:48,510 --> 01:49:52,510
meanwhile Rises the moon

1031
01:49:55,700 --> 01:50:11,400
Days pull you up just like a daffodil Uprooted from its
garden They'll tell you what you owe But know even so Rises

1032
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:13,600
the moon

1033
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:38,740
Be visited by sleep I promise you that soon the autumn comes
to steal away each dream you keep breathe breathe breathe

1034
01:50:46,080 --> 01:51:00,760
i don't i don't want there to be an outro this channel
scares me yay that was rises the moon the moon it's a really

1035
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:12,720
pretty song I think I think there's some other songs I want
to sing we'll go back to carrot fun one of them is I saw

1036
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:19,780
some people requesting carpenters here you go oh why

1037
01:51:34,970 --> 01:52:00,510
do birds suddenly appear every time you near just like me
they long to be close to you why do stars fall down from the

1038
01:52:00,510 --> 01:52:23,470
sky every time you walk by just like me they long to be
close to you On the day that you were born the angels got

1039
01:52:23,470 --> 01:52:35,110
together and decided to create a dream come true So they
sprinkled moonless in your hair and golden starlight in your

1040
01:52:35,110 --> 01:53:00,110
eyes of blue That is why girls in the town follow you all
around just like me they long to be close to you

1041
01:53:26,140 --> 01:53:37,280
When you were born, the angels got together And decided to
create a dream come true So they sprinkled moon dust in your

1042
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:59,200
hair And golden starlight in your eyes of blue That is why
all the girls in town Follow you all around Just like me,

1043
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:04,140
they long to be close to you.

1044
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:16,300
Just like me, they long to be close to you.

1045
01:54:31,820 --> 01:54:35,620
you Ah

1046
01:54:40,830 --> 01:55:03,730
Ah Close to you Remember I sing the song I hold my little
baby snake Ah Ah And I sing to him Close to you Ah Ah Close

1047
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:08,670
to you Ah

1048
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:21,240
A cheeky spirit on Twitter told me you are an enjoyer of
cultured ren fan manga and here I am here to say bass.

1049
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:23,980
Also, I forget how beautiful your singing is.

1050
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:26,820
Thank you for the super chat.

1051
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:29,080
Close to you.

1052
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:30,800
I love you little snake.

1053
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:33,680
Okay, go back to standing on my desk as you always are.

1054
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:40,980
I got a snake from a gotcha, a snake figure, and I sing
this.

1055
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,180
him every time.

1056
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:51,660
Whether now or in the future, I think it would be real nice
to hear you saying don't speak by no doubt, even if it would

1057
01:55:51,660 --> 01:55:52,280
be lethal.

1058
01:55:53,020 --> 01:55:54,520
Don't speak by no doubt.

1059
01:55:58,360 --> 01:56:00,080
Don't speak by no doubt.

1060
01:56:02,740 --> 01:56:04,740
Hopelessly devoted to you from Greece?

1061
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:06,460
I've never sung that before.

1062
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:09,080
Could you sing fine on the outside?

1063
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:09,840
Oh, I can!

1064
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:11,060
Wait, I don't...

1065
01:56:11,060 --> 01:56:12,520
Hold on, let me hear the don't speak.

1066
01:56:13,660 --> 01:56:14,700
Do I know this song?

1067
01:56:23,170 --> 01:56:44,070
You and me We used to be together Every day together Always
I really feel That I'm losing my best friend I can't believe

1068
01:56:44,070 --> 01:57:03,730
this could be the end It looks as though you're letting go
And if it's real, my friend don't wanna know Don't speak, I

1069
01:57:03,730 --> 01:57:16,690
know just what you're saying So please just stop explaining
And don't tell me cause it hurts And don't speak, I know

1070
01:57:16,690 --> 01:57:17,030

1071
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:23,400
way it's your reasons Don't tell me.

1072
01:57:27,550 --> 01:57:32,810
Our memories, they can be inviting.

1073
01:57:33,590 --> 01:57:37,490
But some are all, some are all together, might be
frightening.

1074
01:57:40,130 --> 01:57:49,970
As we dive, boom, you and I, with my head in my hands, I sit
and cry.

1075
01:57:52,430 --> 01:57:56,170
Don't speak, I know just what you're saying.

1076
01:57:56,190 --> 01:57:59,590
So please stop explaining.

1077
01:58:00,290 --> 01:58:03,050
Don't tell me cause it hurts.

1078
01:58:03,370 --> 01:58:04,790
No, no, no, no.

1079
01:58:05,310 --> 01:58:06,310
Don't speak.

1080
01:58:06,950 --> 01:58:09,130
I know what you're thinking.

1081
01:58:09,910 --> 01:58:12,470
And I don't need your reasons.

1082
01:58:13,010 --> 01:58:15,690
Don't tell me cause it hurts.

1083
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:17,530
Oh my god, I haven't heard this song forever.

1084
01:58:18,370 --> 01:58:20,470
It's not ending.

1085
01:58:21,090 --> 01:58:23,190
I gotta stop pretending.

1086
01:58:24,130 --> 01:58:25,130
But we are.

1087
01:58:26,190 --> 01:58:27,330
knows far.

1088
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:37,320
I have not heard this song in so long, so I don't remember
it very well, I'm sorry.

1089
01:58:56,200 --> 01:59:04,020
You and me, I can see us dying, are we?

01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:12,200
Don't speak, I know just what you're saying, so please stop

01:59:12,820 --> 01:59:15,280
Don't tell me cause it hurts.

1099
02:01:24,460 --> 02:01:25,360
No, not seal.

1100
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:28,220
A seal.

1101
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:34,080
I think I'm confusing artist.

1102
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:43,600
You remember me by Jewel.

1103
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:45,380
I don't know if I know that one.

1104
02:01:57,460 --> 02:02:02,440
There used to be a grain tower alone on the sea.

1105
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:17,100
You became the light on the dark side of me And love
remained way at your mark as the heart and on the pill But

1106
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:30,640
did you know that when it snows, my eyes become large And
the light that you shine can be seen Baby, I compare you to

1107
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:39,160
a kiss from a rose on the ground Ooh, the more I get of you,
the stranger it feels, yeah.

1108
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:47,980
And now that your rose is in bloom, a line hits the gloom on
the gray.

1109
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:50,560
What does that mean?

1110
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:53,700
A kiss from a rose on the gray.

1111
02:02:54,180 --> 02:02:54,860
What's the gray?

1112
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:58,760
I don't understand it.

1113
02:03:02,020 --> 02:03:03,540
There's so much a man can't do.

1114
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:17,280
I can tell you so much he can say You will remain my power,
my pleasure, my pain Baby, to me You're like a growing

1115
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:22,800
addiction, I can't even deny Oh God, won't you tell me, is
it the healthy baby?

1116
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:32,960
Oh wait, but did you know that when it snows My eyes become
large and the light that you shine can be seen?

1117
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:41,000
And baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grave.

1118
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:46,340
Ooh, the more I get a few, the stranger it feels, so yeah.

1119
02:03:47,220 --> 02:03:54,920
And now that your rose is in bloom, a light is the gloom on
the grave.

1120
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:56,980
She's basically D.

1121
02:03:57,440 --> 02:03:58,380
What do you mean by that?

1122
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:02,820
It's meant to be abstract.

1123
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:37,840
on a queen oh kiss by a rose oh i've never oh oh but all
goes away oh i've been kissed by a rose there is so much a

1124
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:51,820
man can tell wait oh gosh i don't remember what he can say
you remain my power my pleasure my pain I can't remember

1125
02:04:51,820 --> 02:04:53,000
this song!

1126
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:54,760
I can't remember!

1127
02:04:55,760 --> 02:05:06,980
But did you know that when it snows, my eyes become large
and the light that you shine can be seen?

1128
02:05:07,420 --> 02:05:20,780
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grave Ooh,
the more I get a view, the stranger it feels, yeah And now

1129
02:05:20,780 --> 02:05:33,640
that your roses in blue A light hushed the gloom on the gray
Yes, I compare you to a kiss from the rose on the gray Ooh,

1130
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:47,360
the more I get a view, the stranger it feels, yeah And now
that your roses in blue Light hits the gloom on the grave.

1131
02:05:52,710 --> 02:05:54,170
This isn't about drugs, is it?

1132
02:05:58,660 --> 02:06:11,120
Now that your roses in bloom, a light hits the gloom on the
grave.

1133
02:06:14,680 --> 02:06:15,420
Drugs, no!

1134
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:18,540
It's about kissing roses.

1135
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:18,860
Roses.

1136
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:19,980
Obviously.

1137
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:30,300
Most common views are either touching the edge of death or
the rose bringing back vibrance to life that was depressive

1138
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:30,880
and gray.

1139
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:31,320
Ah.

1140
02:06:31,900 --> 02:06:33,480
See, that sounds so nice.

1141
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:34,780
It's about love, I think.

1142
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:37,020
Yeah.

1143
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:37,840
See?

1144
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:39,700
Gosh, you guys.

1145
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:42,200
It's about love.

1146
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:43,700
It's about love.

1147
02:06:45,820 --> 02:06:47,120
Is it about anything?

1148
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:48,080
Who knows?

1149
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:49,840
Who knows?

1150
02:06:50,820 --> 02:06:52,000
What time is it?

1151
02:06:52,260 --> 02:06:57,240
I've only been, I've sung 22 songs in two hours.

1152
02:06:58,760 --> 02:06:59,420
That's so many.

1153
02:06:59,500 --> 02:07:00,860
Hold on, I'm going to eat some more of my food.

1154
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:01,640
I hope it's okay.

1155
02:07:03,940 --> 02:07:04,920
And let's take a little break.

1156
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:08,440
Let's take a little tiny break.

1157
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:12,420
Music.

1158
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:14,680
Let me eat.

1159
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:16,180
Music.

1160
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:19,460
Oh.

1161
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:26,000
Break time.

1162
02:07:26,380 --> 02:07:27,700
So I can eat my food.

1163
02:07:40,690 --> 02:07:42,030
Yeah, this will be hard cut.

1164
02:07:42,270 --> 02:07:42,610
Don't worry.

1165
02:07:43,370 --> 02:07:45,470
We're like, I want to go watch something else.

1166
02:07:49,690 --> 02:07:50,730
Yeah, I get it.

1167
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:56,260
I don't want you to hear me.

1168
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:00,160
Oh, um.

1169
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:19,360
I'm like eating it so fast.

1170
02:08:20,940 --> 02:08:22,680
I'm eating it so fast.

1171
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:24,960
My tummy started to growl, though.

1172
02:08:44,790 --> 02:08:45,050
You know what?

1173
02:08:45,050 --> 02:08:46,170
Don't watch me eat either.

1174
02:08:46,930 --> 02:08:47,710
I'm going to turn around.

1175
02:08:56,180 --> 02:08:56,880
There we go.

1176
02:08:57,380 --> 02:08:59,680
Now you can't listen to me.

1177
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:00,020
Wait.

1178
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:01,240
Hold on.

1179
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:02,760
I'm going to stay away from my life.

1180
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:10,780
Okay.

1181
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:12,020
Okay.

1182
02:09:12,780 --> 02:09:13,500
I don't...

1183
02:09:22,190 --> 02:09:22,790
Probably.

1184
02:09:34,220 --> 02:09:36,840
She moves away from the mic to breathe.

1185
02:09:56,840 --> 02:09:59,140
Her floor was your lucky number.

1186
02:10:04,260 --> 02:10:05,460
Chocolate rain.

1187
02:10:06,240 --> 02:10:06,780
Some say...

1188
02:10:06,780 --> 02:10:08,920
Is that true that that song is about pooping?

1189
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:11,440
Is it true?

1190
02:10:12,460 --> 02:10:14,220
That song is about pooping?

1191
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:18,200
I hope not.

1192
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:32,790
I got some broccoli on my desk.

1193
02:10:40,290 --> 02:10:41,590
Into the trash!

1194
02:10:43,750 --> 02:10:44,730
There we go.

1195
02:10:45,670 --> 02:10:48,410
Think you could sing Six... Wait, it's...

1196
02:10:48,410 --> 02:10:50,190
Kiss me by Sixpence none the richer.

1197
02:10:50,730 --> 02:10:51,710
Yeah, I can sing that one.

1198
02:10:58,010 --> 02:11:00,290
Chocolate rain isn't about pooping, it's not.

1199
02:11:03,550 --> 02:11:05,730
I don't know, I just remember hearing that as a kid.

1200
02:11:06,750 --> 02:11:10,410
People were like, some stay dry while others feel the pain.

1201
02:11:11,450 --> 02:11:12,030
Chocolate rain.

1202
02:11:17,340 --> 02:11:18,280
It's about what?

1203
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:20,300
Oh, I think I'm way off.

1204
02:11:21,860 --> 02:11:22,360
I

1205
02:11:26,220 --> 02:11:29,300
only know that what the chocolate rain...

1206
02:11:31,700 --> 02:11:35,800
my bad i didn't mean to be insensitive i just had no idea

1207
02:11:51,380 --> 02:11:53,660
i regret my words and actions

1208
02:11:57,600 --> 02:12:00,780
i regret my words and actions my words and deeds

1209
02:12:16,160 --> 02:12:24,120
fabulous from high school musical too Oh my gosh, I don't
know if I I don't know if I know it very well

1210
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:37,520
That's the one that goes I'm feeling fabulous Fabulous I
don't know it

1211
02:12:53,230 --> 02:12:54,310
Is this archived?

1212
02:12:54,450 --> 02:12:55,650
I don't know Maybe not anymore

1213
02:13:00,130 --> 02:13:03,150
Maybe not anymore Maybe not anymore

1214
02:13:09,310 --> 02:13:21,400
No, I'm just kidding.

1215
02:13:23,220 --> 02:13:24,200
What was I going to do?

1216
02:13:24,620 --> 02:13:27,160
I wonder if someone required...

1217
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:29,520
I wonder if this is on here.

1218
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:40,680
No, I'm going to have to find an instrumental on YouTube.

1219
02:13:49,950 --> 02:13:51,970
Let me check if this one works.

1220
02:13:52,510 --> 02:13:53,650
Sorry, you're going to hear no music.

1221
02:13:59,550 --> 02:14:00,490
I think so.

1222
02:14:00,670 --> 02:14:04,650
I don't hear some awful, terrible intro or anything.

1223
02:14:04,930 --> 02:14:05,860
So let's do this one.

1224
02:14:09,790 --> 02:14:10,070
Okay.

1225
02:14:15,230 --> 02:14:16,790
Kaliopi Mori's End of Alive.

1226
02:14:16,910 --> 02:14:17,810
There's a karaoke version.

1227
02:14:18,830 --> 02:14:20,550
Oh, I don't know, though.

1228
02:14:21,450 --> 02:14:23,010
I like that song a lot.

1229
02:14:24,890 --> 02:14:25,750
I've never tried singing it.

1230
02:14:25,790 --> 02:14:29,990
I'm so nervous to sing to sing other VTuber songs sometimes.

1231
02:14:32,930 --> 02:14:34,310
I'll think about it, though.

1232
02:14:34,850 --> 02:14:37,830
Maybe one day I'll do, like, a dedicated hollow live
karaoke.

1233
02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:43,110
Maybe I'll do a dedicated hollow live karaoke sometime.

1234
02:14:43,550 --> 02:14:45,550
Because I've been singing a lot of Stellar Steller.

1235
02:14:46,830 --> 02:14:55,030
I've been singing so much, or not singing, but, like
listening to Stellar Stellar so much so Callie won't mind

1236
02:14:55,030 --> 02:15:05,470
I'm I don't know I'm afraid of upsetting people so I don't
know I want to if I do upset people I would at least do the

1237
02:15:05,470 --> 02:15:20,930
songs justice you know hmm we'll see we'll see okay okie

1240
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:21,880
Learn to be okay with just me, just me, just me, just me,
and I'll be fine on the outside.

1241
02:16:26,240 --> 02:16:29,660
I like to eat in school by myself.

1242
02:16:31,340 --> 02:16:59,400
anyway so I'll just stay right here right here right here
right here and I'll be fine on the outside And so I just sit

1243
02:16:59,400 --> 02:17:12,240
in my room after hours with the moon And think of who knows
my name Would you cry if I died?

1244
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:17,180
Would you remember my face?

1245
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:37,180
Oh, I left home, I packed up and I

1246
02:17:44,020 --> 02:17:52,120
asked one day and I laughed I laughed

1247
02:17:57,720 --> 02:18:07,860
I sound wine on the outside oh my

1248
02:18:26,890 --> 02:18:41,030
loss sometimes I'm confused sometimes I find that I am not
all right and And I cry.

1249
02:18:41,850 --> 02:18:41,850
And

1250
02:19:15,570 --> 02:19:16,470
I...

1251
02:19:16,470 --> 02:19:31,190
So I just sit in my room After hours with the moon And think
of who knows my name Would you cry if I died?

1252
02:19:31,310 --> 02:19:36,650
Would you remember my face?

1253
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:52,280
That one's kind of hard to sing.

1254
02:19:55,380 --> 02:19:57,180
Mine on the outside.

1255
02:19:59,040 --> 02:19:59,520
Yeah.

1256
02:20:00,820 --> 02:20:01,400
Let's see.

1257
02:20:01,560 --> 02:20:03,380
Another one that people were asking for.

1258
02:20:03,480 --> 02:20:05,400
Oh, there was one that I wanted to sing.

1259
02:20:09,360 --> 02:20:10,180
How do I...

1260
02:20:10,180 --> 02:20:10,700
Oh, it's a...

1261
02:20:10,700 --> 02:20:11,220
What's it called?

1262
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:16,480
Hold on.

1263
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:17,940
I have it.

1264
02:20:18,180 --> 02:20:21,160
I'm the tippy, tippy, tippy, tippy of my tongue.

1265
02:20:22,320 --> 02:20:22,640
Oh.

1266
02:20:25,300 --> 02:20:26,580
Maybe if I search this.

1267
02:20:26,960 --> 02:20:27,220
Okay.

1268
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:33,640
I've never actually seen Steven Universe before, but I
really like the music.

1269
02:20:35,420 --> 02:20:38,880
So I'm going to sing this one next.

1270
02:20:48,810 --> 02:21:02,010
If I could begin to be half of what you think of me, I could
do about anything I could even learn how to love when I see

1271
02:21:02,010 --> 02:21:04,130
the way you act.

1272
02:21:04,270 --> 02:21:14,270
Wondering when I'm coming back, I could do about anything I
could even learn how to love like you.

1273
02:21:18,410 --> 02:21:19,330
Love like

1274
02:21:24,630 --> 02:21:25,930
you.

1275
02:21:36,350 --> 02:21:47,450
I always thought I might be bad, now I'm sure that it's
true, because I think you're so good, and I'm nothing like

1276
02:21:47,450 --> 02:21:47,450
you.

1277
02:21:47,470 --> 02:22:04,710
you look at you go I just adore you I wish that I knew what
makes you think I'm so special if I could begin to do

1278
02:22:04,710 --> 02:22:16,870
something that does right by you I would do about anything I
would even learn how to love when

1279
02:22:20,440 --> 02:22:32,820
I see The way you look shaken by how long it took I could do
about anything I could even learn how to love like you

1280
02:22:36,100 --> 02:22:38,820
Love me like you

1281
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:45,160
Love me like you

1282
02:23:00,410 --> 02:23:07,370
Song is so pretty oh my god Love like you.

1283
02:23:08,390 --> 02:23:08,630
BAM!

1284
02:23:09,390 --> 02:23:09,610
BAM!

1285
02:23:12,070 --> 02:23:12,590
Yay!

1286
02:23:15,670 --> 02:23:16,490
Let's see.

1287
02:23:19,030 --> 02:23:19,730
Let's see.

1288
02:23:19,910 --> 02:23:23,450
I don't know this other one, though, but I like it.

1289
02:23:24,250 --> 02:23:26,110
I know a little bit of it.

1290
02:23:26,150 --> 02:23:27,650
I might mess up the middle part.

1291
02:23:28,310 --> 02:23:29,410
I'm going to try it anyway.

1292
02:23:30,910 --> 02:23:32,350
If I mess it up, sorry.

1293
02:23:39,160 --> 02:23:46,860
I was fine with the men who had come into her life now and
again.

1294
02:23:47,340 --> 02:23:55,000
I was fine, because I knew that there didn't really matter
until you.

1295
02:23:55,960 --> 02:24:03,280
I was fine when you came, and we fought like it was all some
silly game.

1296
02:24:03,700 --> 02:24:06,900
Over her, who'd she choose?

1297
02:24:08,560 --> 02:24:13,020
All those years I'd never thought I'd lose.

1298
02:24:14,200 --> 02:24:15,900
It's over, isn't it?

1299
02:24:16,540 --> 02:24:19,660
Isn't it over?

1300
02:24:20,560 --> 02:24:22,880
It's over, isn't it?

1301
02:24:23,320 --> 02:24:24,400
Isn't it?

1302
02:24:25,180 --> 02:24:26,540
Isn't it over?

1303
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:33,440
You won and she chose you and she loved you and she's gone.

1304
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:35,980
It's over, isn't it?

1305
02:24:36,040 --> 02:24:38,540
Why can't I move on?

1306
02:24:40,620 --> 02:24:54,500
War and glory Reinvention, fusion, freedom Her attention out
in daylight My potential, bold, precise, experimental Who am

1307
02:24:54,500 --> 02:24:56,800
I now in this world without her?

1308
02:24:57,380 --> 02:25:01,460
Petty and dull with the nerve to doubt her What does it
matter?

1309
02:25:01,700 --> 02:25:05,880
It's already done Now I've got to be there for a sign

1310
02:25:09,160 --> 02:25:10,260
Isn't it?

1311
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:12,480
Isn't it over?

1312
02:25:13,140 --> 02:25:15,280
It's over, isn't it?

1313
02:25:15,660 --> 02:25:18,680
Isn't it over?

1314
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:25,560
You won and she chose you and she loved you and she's gone.

1315
02:25:28,140 --> 02:25:30,040
It's over, isn't it?

1316
02:25:30,420 --> 02:25:33,660
Why can't I move on?

1317
02:25:38,900 --> 02:25:43,280
Why can't I move on?

1318
02:25:47,180 --> 02:25:48,040
It's so Jover.

1319
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:50,980
It's Jover, isn't it?

1320
02:25:51,460 --> 02:25:52,400
Isn't it?

1321
02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:54,520
Isn't it Jover?

1322
02:25:55,380 --> 02:25:57,980
It's Jover, isn't it?

1323
02:25:58,320 --> 02:25:59,460
Isn't it?

1324
02:25:59,640 --> 02:26:00,640
Thank you!

1325
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:03,940
I'm on a flight to Colombia!

1326
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:06,040
Wow, how fun!

1327
02:26:06,980 --> 02:26:10,520
I want to thank you for inspiring me to visit new places and
get out of my comfort zone!

1328
02:26:11,560 --> 02:26:13,820
Shakira or any songs from Enkanto.

1329
02:26:14,700 --> 02:26:16,520
Thank you for always being amazing.

1330
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:21,180
I don't know if I know very many Shakira songs that well but
I can't sing Enkanto.

1331
02:26:22,820 --> 02:26:23,420
Enkanto.

1332
02:26:26,060 --> 02:26:29,100
What's a song that I could sing?

1333
02:26:30,520 --> 02:26:32,440
It's Fanta over.

1334
02:26:38,660 --> 02:26:39,260
Um...

1335
02:26:41,680 --> 02:26:45,480
I think maybe the best thing I could do is we don't talk
about Bruno, maybe.

1336
02:26:46,020 --> 02:26:47,860
Down, thank you so much for the 20 Gifted.

1337
02:26:48,260 --> 02:26:50,060
Why did you make me cry in the middle of my work?

1338
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:54,520
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

1339
02:26:54,700 --> 02:27:00,000
Oh, I only really know we don't talk about Bruno and the
family Madrigal.

1340
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:03,820
But I don't think I could sing that one very well because
it's kind of fast.

1341
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:04,580
I've never sung it before.

1342
02:27:04,940 --> 02:27:05,900
We don't talk about Bruno.

1343
02:27:06,280 --> 02:27:07,380
I'm going to sing all the parts.

1344
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:11,540
Oh, my God.

1345
02:27:11,560 --> 02:27:14,440
That high is really, thank you for the 50s, thank you.

1346
02:27:15,180 --> 02:27:17,800
About Bruno, no, no, no.

1347
02:27:18,460 --> 02:27:20,680
We don't talk about Bruno.

1348
02:27:22,020 --> 02:27:25,520
But it was my wedding day, we were getting ready.

1349
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:27,000
Wait, hold on.

1350
02:27:27,060 --> 02:27:27,460
Oh, there.

1351
02:27:28,020 --> 02:27:29,560
The cloud in the sky.

1352
02:27:29,900 --> 02:27:31,880
My cloud's so loud in the sky.

1353
02:27:32,460 --> 02:27:35,580
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin.

1354
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:36,540
I'm there.

1355
02:27:36,860 --> 02:27:39,140
You're telling the story, are am I?

1356
02:27:39,220 --> 02:27:40,820
I'm sorry, maybe that go on.

1357
02:27:41,560 --> 02:27:45,360
Bruno said it looks like rain What if you tell us?

1358
02:27:45,700 --> 02:27:56,380
In doing so he floods my brain I wanna guess the umbrella
Married in a hurricane What a joyous day but anyway We don't

1359
02:27:56,380 --> 02:28:07,180
talk about Bruno No, no, no We don't talk about Bruno Hey
Good to live in fear of Bruno's starting stumbling I can

1360
02:28:07,180 --> 02:28:12,620
always hear I'm sort of mumbling I associate with, well,
well, yeah I messed it up.

1361
02:28:12,740 --> 02:28:13,680
I couldn't remember this.

1362
02:28:13,940 --> 02:28:16,060
It's a heavy lift with the gifts so humbling.

1363
02:28:16,220 --> 02:28:18,300
Always left a bula in the family fumbling.

1364
02:28:18,540 --> 02:28:21,140
Raffling with the prophecies they couldn't understand.

1365
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:22,780
Do you understand?

1366
02:28:23,160 --> 02:28:24,980
Seven foot frame.

1367
02:28:25,260 --> 02:28:27,040
Rats so long is back.

1368
02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:29,000
When he calls your name.

1369
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,100
I forgot that part was coming up.

1370
02:28:31,700 --> 02:28:36,680
Yeah, he sees your dreams and freaks on your screams.

1371
02:28:37,720 --> 02:28:41,540
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no, no.

1372
02:28:41,560 --> 02:28:44,640
No, we don't talk about Bruno.

1373
02:28:46,940 --> 02:28:48,400
He told me my fish would die.

1374
02:28:48,440 --> 02:28:48,920
Excuse me.

1375
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:50,080
Stay dead.

1376
02:28:51,240 --> 02:28:54,940
He told me I grew a god and just like he said.

1377
02:28:55,880 --> 02:28:57,760
Oh, my hair would disappear.

1378
02:28:58,120 --> 02:28:59,640
Now look at my head.

1379
02:28:59,660 --> 02:29:00,420
No, no.

1380
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:04,660
Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read.

1381
02:29:05,160 --> 02:29:18,820
He told me that the life of my dreams would be promised and
someday be mine he told me that my power would grow like the

1382
02:29:18,820 --> 02:29:32,380
grapes that thrive on the vine he told me that the men of my
dreams wouldn't be just out of reach but truth to another

1383
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:42,500
it's like I hear him now it's like I hear him now I can hear
him now.

1384
02:29:42,580 --> 02:29:43,760
Hmm, Bruno.

1385
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:46,320
Yeah, about that Bruno.

1386
02:29:46,920 --> 02:29:48,620
I really need to know about Bruno.

1387
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:51,000
Give me the truth and the whole truth, Bruno.

1388
02:29:51,680 --> 02:29:54,460
Isabella, your boyfriend's here.

Dinner.

1390
02:29:56,440 --> 02:30:03,620
He told me that the life of my dreams would be promised and
someday be mine.

1391
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:21,780
He told me that my power would grow on the vine He told me
that the life of my dreams Would be promised and someday be

1392
02:30:21,780 --> 02:30:34,120
mine He told me that my power would grow Like the grapes We
talk about Bruno We talk about Bruno

1393
02:30:38,760 --> 02:30:48,520
Oh my god This song is so crazy towards the end Blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1394

Spider-Wars by No Doubt.

1397
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,280
Or Centuria by Sublime.

1398
02:30:58,280 --> 02:31:01,480
Maybe next time, I don't, I don't know if I, maybe I would
have to hear them, and I would know.

1399
02:31:02,940 --> 02:31:04,760
Next time, I will make a note of those.

1400
02:31:05,920 --> 02:31:06,380
Bruno.

1401
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:08,060
Bruno.

1402
02:31:09,020 --> 02:31:11,080
We don't talk about Bruno.

1403
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:14,080
We don't talk about Bruno.

1404
02:31:14,800 --> 02:31:15,880

1411
02:32:38,980 --> 02:32:45,540
High time sharpens, heightens each sensation.

1412
02:32:46,880 --> 02:32:54,040
Darkness wakes and stirs imagination.

1413
02:32:55,340 --> 02:33:02,580
Silently the senses abandon their defenses.

1414
02:33:03,120 --> 02:33:09,200
Helpless to resist the notes I write.

1415
02:33:10,080 --> 02:33:16,300
Fork I compose the music of the night.

1416
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:18,040
Is this a song by Phantom?

1417
02:33:18,760 --> 02:33:33,100
Slowly, gently, light on furls its splendor, Raspid,
sensuous, tremulous and tender.

1418
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:48,360
Hearing is believing, music is deceiving, hard as lightning,
soft as candle night.

1419
02:33:49,240 --> 02:33:54,980
Dare you trust the music of the night?

1420
02:33:55,880 --> 02:34:02,700
Your eyes for your calling, tell the truth.

1421
02:34:03,120 --> 02:34:06,280
And the truth is what...

1422
02:34:06,280 --> 02:34:07,960
Oh my god, my mic is peaking.

1423
02:34:09,400 --> 02:34:16,820
See, in the dark, it's easy to pretend.

1424
02:34:16,860 --> 02:34:19,760
That is

1425
02:34:23,240 --> 02:34:26,200
one way down to me.

1426
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:36,580
Softly, deafly, music shall come.

1427
02:34:36,600 --> 02:34:47,340
you hear it, feel it, secretly possess you.

1428
02:34:48,200 --> 02:34:54,860
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind.

1429
02:34:55,300 --> 02:35:01,900
In this darkness which you know you cannot find.

1430
02:35:02,680 --> 02:35:07,600
The darkness of the music of the not.

1431
02:35:12,660 --> 02:35:21,420
We threw a strange new world, leave all thoughts of the
world you knew before.

1432
02:35:22,800 --> 02:35:30,120
Close your eyes and let music set you free.

1433
02:35:31,380 --> 02:35:32,920
Oh, not a good thought for us.

1434
02:35:33,440 --> 02:35:39,820
With them, you, can you belong to me?

1435
02:35:42,940 --> 02:35:53,840
The whining, falling, sweet intoxication

1436
02:35:56,900 --> 02:36:16,340
Touching, trusting, savour each sensation Let the dream
begin, let your dream begin darkest i give in to the power

1437
02:36:16,340 --> 02:36:28,780
of the music that i write the power of the music of the
night

1438
02:36:33,320 --> 02:36:38,740
oh my abs are gonna go to work out oh my diaper i'm like

1439
02:36:42,220 --> 02:36:43,480
Oh, I can't.

1440
02:36:53,930 --> 02:36:59,310
How long can make my song take flight?

1441
02:37:00,570 --> 02:37:06,370
Help me make the music all the...

1442
02:37:12,100 --> 02:37:13,580
Wait, hold on, I want to hear that one.

1443
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:15,180
Awesome.

1444
02:37:16,020 --> 02:37:19,640
When it says, help me, all I can think of is, help me white
girl.

1445
02:37:21,020 --> 02:37:21,600
Hold on.

1446
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:24,340
Music of the...

1447
02:37:43,820 --> 02:37:44,260
Yes!

1448
02:37:45,320 --> 02:37:46,420
We can go back to Disney.

1449
02:37:48,820 --> 02:37:50,140
Music of the night.

1450
02:37:50,480 --> 02:37:54,760
I like singing, like, things, obviously, that I like to
sing.

1451
02:37:54,960 --> 02:37:56,240
But it's also really fun to sing.

1452
02:37:56,600 --> 02:37:57,380
Like, you know, I never...

1453
02:37:57,380 --> 02:37:59,580
I sing Phantom of the Opera, I feel, pretty often.

1454
02:38:00,500 --> 02:38:00,940
But...

1455
02:38:02,920 --> 02:38:03,360
But...

1456
02:38:03,360 --> 02:38:05,940
I've never sung Music of the Night before, so it's kind of
fun.

1457
02:38:06,160 --> 02:38:08,140
Make a man out of you.

1458
02:38:13,290 --> 02:38:15,450
Dun, dun, dun, dun,

1459
02:38:25,640 --> 02:38:25,640
dun.

1460
02:38:30,060 --> 02:38:32,360
Make a whisper out of you.

1461
02:38:33,960 --> 02:38:35,500
Well hi Raiders, thank you!

1462
02:38:36,700 --> 02:38:54,820
Let's get down to business To defeat the Huns Did they send
me daughters When I asked for sons You're the saddest bunch

1463
02:38:54,820 --> 02:39:01,420
I ever ever met but you can bet before we're through mr.

1464
02:39:02,460 --> 02:39:06,420
I'll make a man out of you

1465
02:39:09,560 --> 02:39:28,160
down tranquil as a forest but on fire within yeah once you
find your center you are sure to win you're a spineless This

1466
02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:33,740
pale, pathetic lot, and you haven't got a clue.

1467
02:39:35,320 --> 02:39:41,580
Somehow I'll make a man out of you.

1468
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:47,900
I'm never gonna catch my breath, single by those who knew
me.

1469
02:39:47,980 --> 02:39:50,800
Boy was I a fool in school for cutting Jim.

1470
02:39:50,880 --> 02:39:52,180
Shut the hell up, this is my part!

1471
02:39:52,780 --> 02:39:56,340
This guy's got him scared to death, hope he doesn't see
right through me.

1472
02:39:57,860 --> 02:39:59,700
I knew how to swim.

1473
02:39:59,820 --> 02:40:01,080
Be a man.

1474
02:40:01,340 --> 02:40:04,280
Green must be swift as the coursing rhythm.

1475
02:40:04,300 --> 02:40:05,320
Be a man.

1476
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:08,440
With all the force of the great typhoon.

1477
02:40:08,500 --> 02:40:09,580
Be a man.

1478
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:13,120
With all the strength of a raging fire.

1479
02:40:13,860 --> 02:40:18,380
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon.

1480
02:40:22,240 --> 02:40:29,320
Time is racing toward us till the Huns arrive.

1481
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:37,220
He'd my every order and you might survive.

1482
02:40:38,500 --> 02:40:42,320
You're unsuited for the rage of war.

1483
02:40:42,740 --> 02:40:45,380
So pack up, go home, you're through.

1484
02:40:46,680 --> 02:40:48,380
How could I?

1485
02:40:54,710 --> 02:40:55,930
Be a man.

1486
02:40:56,110 --> 02:41:03,050
We must be swift as a coursing river with all the force of a
great typhoon.

1487
02:41:04,030 --> 02:41:12,880
With all the strength of a raging fire, Mysterious as the
dark side of the moon.

1488
02:41:16,210 --> 02:41:16,950
Be a man.

1489
02:41:17,270 --> 02:41:24,330
We must be swift as the coursing river With all the force of
a great typhoon.

1490
02:41:24,390 --> 02:41:29,030
Be a man with all the strength of a raging fire.

1491
02:41:30,010 --> 02:41:35,890
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon Yeah!

1492
02:41:38,270 --> 02:41:40,190
Oh no, I started to dance again.

1493
02:41:40,610 --> 02:41:40,990
Oh no.

1494
02:41:43,090 --> 02:41:49,050
I couldn't see who rated me because I think YouTube glitched
and like only showed like a white bar at the top.

1495
02:41:49,510 --> 02:41:52,010
So thank you, whoever rated, thank you.

1496
02:41:53,170 --> 02:41:54,930
Um, hold on, I need a drink of water.

1497
02:41:58,550 --> 02:41:59,510
Da moon!

1498
02:42:02,840 --> 02:42:04,420
Okay, that was so fun.

1499
02:42:07,300 --> 02:42:09,520
I just want to sing and dance now.

1500
02:42:11,440 --> 02:42:13,680
I'll make a man out of you.

1501
02:42:15,180 --> 02:42:17,000
Actually, there's another song that I want to do.

1502
02:42:17,800 --> 02:42:19,640
But I always fuck up the last part.

1503
02:42:19,920 --> 02:42:20,260
Oh, sorry.

1504
02:42:20,740 --> 02:42:21,960
I always mess up the last part.

1505
02:42:22,140 --> 02:42:23,080
Dancing Queen!

1506
02:42:23,580 --> 02:42:23,940
Oh, my God.

1507
02:42:24,180 --> 02:42:25,420
Wait, actually, I'll do that instead.

1508
02:42:25,560 --> 02:42:26,640
You're so smart.

1509
02:42:27,280 --> 02:42:27,940
Oh, my gosh.

1510
02:42:28,120 --> 02:42:29,040
You're so smart.

1511
02:42:29,280 --> 02:42:30,140
You're so smart.

1512
02:42:30,540 --> 02:42:31,600
You're so smart.

1513
02:42:32,220 --> 02:42:33,340
Twilight by E-L-O.

1514
02:42:33,420 --> 02:42:34,220
Okay, I'll sing that after.

1515
02:42:53,960 --> 02:42:59,280
You can dance, you can dancing,

1516
02:43:10,560 --> 02:43:12,100

1517
02:43:30,840 --> 02:43:33,940
you gotta look for a king.

1518
02:43:43,160 --> 02:43:50,280
And the music's high with a bit of rock music and
everything's

1519
02:43:55,100 --> 02:43:55,240
right.

1520
02:43:55,380 --> 02:44:02,660
And when you get the chance, you are the dancing queen.

1521
02:44:03,980 --> 02:44:18,340

1525
02:45:22,810 --> 02:45:28,510
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine.

1526
02:45:29,130 --> 02:45:29,670
Oh yeah!

1527
02:45:43,640 --> 02:45:47,360
Watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen.

1528
02:46:27,070 --> 02:46:30,790
I feel like I needed that baby video again.

1529
02:46:31,510 --> 02:46:32,650
Hold on, I'm going to pull it up.

1530
02:46:33,750 --> 02:46:34,710
I'm going to pull up the baby.

1531
02:46:34,810 --> 02:46:35,670
Hold on, where is it?

1532
02:46:37,390 --> 02:46:38,350
Where did I put it?

1533
02:46:42,560 --> 02:46:43,500
Baby video.

1534
02:46:50,860 --> 02:46:51,880
That's me.

1535
02:46:55,090 --> 02:46:55,650
Clapping!

1536
02:46:56,230 --> 02:46:58,750
Someone requested Twilight by ELO, okay.

1537
02:46:59,570 --> 02:47:00,290
This is me.

1538
02:47:01,590 --> 02:47:03,270
Dancing to Twilight, ELO.

1539
02:47:05,870 --> 02:47:07,450
Um, there it is.

1540
02:47:07,830 --> 02:47:09,270
I think I need to put this one...

1541
02:47:09,270 --> 02:47:10,730
No, I'll just sing it out the regular key.

1542
02:47:13,270 --> 02:47:14,210
Do Linkin Park?

1543
02:47:14,370 --> 02:47:15,790
Oh my gosh, I'll do Linkin Park after.

1544
02:47:16,470 --> 02:47:17,470
This is a good idea.

1545
02:47:28,190 --> 02:47:31,450
The vision's dancing in my mind.

1546
02:47:31,750 --> 02:47:34,890
The early dawn, the shades of time.

1547
02:47:35,590 --> 02:47:39,090
Twilight's crawling through my window pane.

1548
02:47:41,530 --> 02:47:44,870
Am I awake or do I dream?

1549
02:47:45,570 --> 02:47:48,670
The strangest pictures I have seen.

1550
02:47:49,250 --> 02:47:53,470
Night is day and twilight's gone away.

1551
02:47:54,850 --> 02:48:01,470
With your head held high and your silent mind You can do it
to me from the open skies.

1552
02:48:01,990 --> 02:48:03,510
It's either real or it's a dream.

1553
02:48:03,750 --> 02:48:05,170
There's nothing that is in between.

1554
02:48:05,670 --> 02:48:09,530
Twilight, I only meant to dream.

1555
02:48:09,550 --> 02:48:18,550
Stay a while Twilight I gave you time To steal my mind Away

1556
02:48:28,840 --> 02:48:43,580
your face You disappeared without a trace You brought me
here But can you take me back Inside the image of your light

1557
02:48:43,580 --> 02:48:50,900
That now is day and once was night You leave me here And
then you go away

1558
02:48:59,300 --> 02:49:02,580
And see the real herbs, the dream there's nothing

1559
02:49:09,710 --> 02:49:12,770
matter The twilight

1560
02:49:36,440 --> 02:49:45,600
With your head held high and your scarlet light You came
down to me from the open skies And see the real herbs, the

1561
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:55,100
dream There's nothing matters in between Twilight, I only
meant to stay a while Twilight,

1562
02:50:14,700 --> 02:50:16,620
only meant to stay a

1563
02:50:44,860 --> 02:50:49,220
while This ending always throws me off I like turned around,
I was just like, is something behind me?

1564
02:50:52,820 --> 02:51:05,200
My ending is so jarring Yay, that was Twilight Twilight
Twilight Twilight Twilight Thank you for your energy, Minto

1565
02:51:05,680 --> 02:51:06,000
Yeah!

1566
02:51:06,860 --> 02:51:08,080
I'll sing a few more songs.

1567
02:51:08,640 --> 02:51:09,800
Someone said Lincoln Park.

1568
02:51:12,600 --> 02:51:12,980
Oh my gosh.

1569
02:51:13,080 --> 02:51:15,640
Now I'm like, oh no, I'm going to get into the emo song
mood.

1570
02:51:17,540 --> 02:51:17,820
Uh-oh.

1571
02:51:18,460 --> 02:51:19,760
I'm going to this stream's never going to end.

1572
02:51:22,040 --> 02:51:24,760
I'm going to do my favorite Lincoln Park song, so I hope you
don't mind.

1573
02:51:27,260 --> 02:51:30,460
I don't think I'll even be able to sing it well, but...

1574
02:51:44,610 --> 02:51:45,130
Please

1575
02:51:53,220 --> 02:51:57,540
consume, like opening the wound up

1576
02:52:00,920 --> 02:52:14,140
You all assume I'm safe here in my room Unless I try to
start again I don't want to be the one that battles always

1577
02:52:14,140 --> 02:52:24,300
choose Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused I
don't know what's worth fighting for Why I have to scream?

1578
02:52:26,080 --> 02:52:29,100
I instigate, say what I don't mean.

1579
02:52:29,700 --> 02:52:31,960
I don't know how I got this way.

1580
02:52:32,300 --> 02:52:33,720
I know it's not alright.

1581
02:52:34,180 --> 02:52:38,960
So I'm breaking the habits.

1582
02:52:39,360 --> 02:52:44,620
I'm breaking the habits tonight.

1583
02:52:47,340 --> 02:52:48,520
Where's the anime background?

1584
02:52:48,640 --> 02:52:49,380
I'm right here!

1585
02:52:50,080 --> 02:52:52,000
Clutching my cure.

1586
02:52:52,420 --> 02:52:54,200
I tightly lock the door.

1587
02:52:54,200 --> 02:53:09,980
I try to catch my breath again Or much more than any time
before I had no options left again I don't want to be the

1588
02:53:09,980 --> 02:53:20,020
one that battles always choose Cause inside I realize that
I'm the one confused I don't know what's worth fighting for

1589
02:53:20,020 --> 02:53:26,560
But why have to scream I don't know why I instigate I don't
mean.

1590
02:53:27,080 --> 02:53:29,600
I don't know how I got this way.

1591
02:53:29,760 --> 02:53:31,300
I'll never be alright.

1592
02:53:31,800 --> 02:53:36,140
So I'm breaking the habits.

1593
02:53:36,940 --> 02:53:37,880
I'm ready

1594
02:54:07,670 --> 02:54:09,850
to show you what I mean.

1595
02:54:10,130 --> 02:54:12,870
I don't know how I got this way.

1596
02:54:12,910 --> 02:54:14,530
I'll never be alright.

1597
02:54:14,990 --> 02:54:16,030
So I'm breaking.

1598
02:54:44,300 --> 02:54:46,380
This song is so awesome.

1599
02:54:48,520 --> 02:54:49,240
Yay!

1600
02:54:50,540 --> 02:54:52,300
That was breaking the habit.

1601
02:54:53,860 --> 02:54:55,140
From Lincoln Park.

1602
02:54:57,540 --> 02:54:58,500
Let's see.

1603
02:55:01,520 --> 02:55:05,560
I feel like I sang like the kids-bought version of it
though.

1604
02:55:07,100 --> 02:55:09,160
I feel like I sang the kids-bought version of it.

1605
02:55:09,260 --> 02:55:11,620
I'm like, I'll break it on the wall!

1606
02:55:11,880 --> 02:55:13,800
Or I'll paint it on the wall!

1607
02:55:20,980 --> 02:55:21,460
Lilium.

1608
02:55:21,600 --> 02:55:22,680
I don't know Latin.

1609
02:55:24,960 --> 02:55:25,840
Who's it even on here?

1610
02:55:25,920 --> 02:55:26,220
Let's see.

1611
02:55:30,420 --> 02:55:31,760
Not on here.

1612
02:55:32,820 --> 02:55:34,880
I saw some people say Fleetwood Mac.

1613
02:55:37,720 --> 02:55:37,760
Um.

1614
02:55:39,240 --> 02:55:39,760
Ugh.

1615
02:55:43,790 --> 02:55:45,230
I don't remember which.

1616
02:55:49,380 --> 02:55:50,020
Let me try.

1617
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:52,660
Um.

1618
02:55:56,800 --> 02:55:57,940
Let biscuit break stuff.

1619
02:55:58,080 --> 02:55:58,720
I'm getting there.

1620
02:55:58,800 --> 02:55:59,500
I'm getting there.

1621
02:55:59,680 --> 02:56:00,240
Gosh.

1622
02:56:00,880 --> 02:56:01,420
Uh.

1623
02:56:02,020 --> 02:56:03,860
Getting there, I'm getting there, I'm getting there.

1624
02:56:11,170 --> 02:56:12,690
Maybe this one.

1625
02:56:16,760 --> 02:56:18,100
It's totally different.

1626
02:56:18,820 --> 02:56:19,260
But you know what?

1627
02:56:19,260 --> 02:56:21,320
This is all whiplash, so it's fine, right?

1628
02:56:22,840 --> 02:56:24,400
This is all whiplash.

1629
02:56:25,420 --> 02:56:26,660
Oh, I forgot to add the dancing queen.

1630
02:56:26,780 --> 02:56:27,240
Thank you.

1631
02:56:31,520 --> 02:56:32,860
I took my love.

1632
02:56:33,080 --> 02:56:34,060
I took it down.

1633
02:56:37,890 --> 02:56:40,130
I'm the mountain, and I turn around.

1634
02:56:40,330 --> 02:56:40,770
Oh my gosh.

1635
02:56:42,030 --> 02:56:44,290
And I saw my reflection.

1636
02:56:44,310 --> 02:56:52,710
in the snow-covered hills, till the landslide brought me
down.

1637
02:56:54,490 --> 02:56:58,590
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?

1638
02:57:00,430 --> 02:57:04,410
Can the child within my heart rise above?

1639
02:57:06,150 --> 02:57:12,210
Can I sail through the change in ocean ties?

1640
02:57:14,310 --> 02:57:21,070
the seasons of my life.

1641
02:57:31,870 --> 02:57:40,370
Afraid of changing, because I've built my life around you.

1642
02:57:42,440 --> 02:57:48,560
But time makes it bolder, even children get older.

1643
02:57:49,580 --> 02:57:52,180
I'm getting older, too.

1644
02:57:56,690 --> 02:58:00,590
This is not the one I meant to pick, because I don't know it
as well.

1645
02:58:00,610 --> 02:58:02,610
But that's okay.

1646
02:58:19,780 --> 02:58:38,000
I'm afraid of changing Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder Even children get older And I'm

1647
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,320
getting older too

1648
02:59:00,170 --> 02:59:16,510
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills well
the landslide bring it down if you see my reflection in the

1649
02:59:16,510 --> 02:59:34,630
snow-covered hills well the landslide bring it down oh the
landslide bring it down hopefully I did it over okay.

1650
02:59:36,190 --> 02:59:37,470
Hopefully I did that okay.

1651
02:59:37,870 --> 02:59:41,670
Oh, yeah, but landslide.

1652
02:59:44,230 --> 02:59:47,890
I'm gonna have to start scooting things up a little bit.

1653
02:59:49,130 --> 02:59:49,730
Yay.

1654
03:00:02,120 --> 03:00:03,160
That was great.

1655
03:00:03,360 --> 03:00:03,840
Thank you.

1656
03:00:04,360 --> 03:00:06,100
Thank you for the claps, everybody.

1657
03:00:06,400 --> 03:00:06,620
Thank you.

1658
03:00:07,940 --> 03:00:08,780
I appreciate it.

1659
03:00:08,860 --> 03:00:09,360
Thank you.

1660
03:00:10,660 --> 03:00:11,560
Thank you.

1661
03:00:12,740 --> 03:00:13,940
Shut up and dance.

1662
03:00:14,840 --> 03:00:16,020
I always end dancing.

1663
03:00:16,420 --> 03:00:17,860
Bravo brings tears to my boomer eyes.

1664
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:18,420
That was beautiful.

1665
03:00:20,820 --> 03:00:23,900
And Sinap, thank you for donating mid-song.

1666
03:00:24,280 --> 03:00:24,860
How dare you?

1667
03:00:24,920 --> 03:00:25,460
No, just kidding.

1668
03:00:26,100 --> 03:00:26,840

1705
03:06:18,480 --> 03:06:19,900
Wait, I need to get ready for this weekend.

1706
03:06:20,100 --> 03:06:20,600

Okay.

1710
03:06:25,720 --> 03:06:26,120
Okay.

1711
03:06:27,680 --> 03:06:28,480
I have...

1712
03:06:28,480 --> 03:06:29,680
Wait, two songs left.

1713
03:06:30,060 --> 03:06:31,780
I can do three if I feel like it.

1714
03:06:33,420 --> 03:06:35,180
Okay, let's do Snake Eater now, then.

1715
03:06:50,550 --> 03:06:50,950
Um...

1716
03:06:50,950 --> 03:06:52,650
Well, I have to find the one that is good.

1717
03:07:02,620 --> 03:07:03,020
Okay.

1718
03:07:14,420 --> 03:07:14,900
Uh-uh.

1719
03:07:25,310 --> 03:07:48,550
What a thrill With darkness and silence through the night
What a thrill I'm searching and I'll melt into you What a

1720
03:07:48,550 --> 03:08:02,290
fear in my heart But you're so supreme I give my life Enough
for honor

1721
03:08:08,080 --> 03:08:26,200
In my time There'll be no one else Crime is the way I fly to
you

1722
03:08:29,340 --> 03:08:36,840
I'm still in a dream Snake eater

1723
03:08:40,580 --> 03:08:59,360
Someday you go through the rain And someday you feed on a
tree from It's ordeal, the trial to survive For the day we

1724
03:08:59,360 --> 03:09:07,360
see new light I give my life not for wrong

1725
03:09:13,720 --> 03:09:40,380
In my time There'll be no one else Crime It's the way I fly
to you I'm still in a dream.

03:09:40,720 --> 03:09:42,860

Oh.

1767
03:12:48,310 --> 03:12:49,810

03:12:50,690 --> 03:12:51,470
I'm going to do this version.

1770
03:12:53,330 --> 03:12:53,630
Okay.

1771
03:13:11,970 --> 03:13:15,930
We were speeding together down the dark avenues.

1772
03:13:19,110 --> 03:13:24,730
But besides all the stardom, all we got was booze.

1773
03:13:26,450 --> 03:13:31,850
But through all the sorrow, we've been riding high.

1774
03:13:34,370 --> 03:13:41,010
And the truth of the matter is I never let you go, let you
go.

1775
03:13:41,810 --> 03:13:46,710
We were scanning the cities, walking to greater do's.

1776
03:13:49,090 --> 03:13:54,130
But besides all the glamour, all we got was bruise.

1777
03:13:56,160 --> 03:14:01,370
But through all the sorrow, we were riding high.

1778
03:14:02,930 --> 03:14:09,930
And the truth of the matter is I never let you go, let you
go.

1779
03:14:14,960 --> 03:14:22,020
You go down just like Holy Mary, Mariana, Mariana Cross.

1780
03:14:22,480 --> 03:14:29,620
Not just another bloody Mary, Mariana, Mariana Cross.

1781
03:14:30,320 --> 03:14:43,260
If you choose to run away with me, I will tell you, tickle
you entirely and i see nothing wrong with that

1782
03:14:58,850 --> 03:15:15,120
we were searching for reasons to play by the rules but we
quickly found out it was just for fool not for all the

1783
03:15:15,120 --> 03:15:27,900
sorrow we'll be riding high and the truth of the matter I'll
never let you go, let you go

1784
03:15:35,120 --> 03:15:35,480
Ah!

1785
03:15:36,140 --> 03:15:53,360
You go down just like Holy Mary, Mariana, Mariana Cross Not
just another bloody Mary, Mariana, Mariana You go down just

1786
03:15:53,360 --> 03:16:07,900
like Holy Mary, Mariana, Mariana, Mariana, Mariana, Your
beauty never ever scared me Mariana, Mariana Cross If you

1787
03:16:07,900 --> 03:16:22,140
choose to run away with me I will tickle you internally And
I see nothing wrong With that

1788
03:16:35,530 --> 03:16:37,890
Nothing wrong

1789
03:16:57,590 --> 03:17:06,750
Oh gosh, you know Sometimes people would end their sets
strong maybe with their most powerful song, but instead I'm

1790
03:17:06,750 --> 03:17:13,110
just going to end everything where I, you know, I don't
sound the best, but I just go crazy with it.

1791
03:17:13,570 --> 03:17:14,430
Like this next one.

1792
03:17:26,820 --> 03:17:30,080
It's just one of those days when you don't want to wake up.

1793
03:17:30,240 --> 03:17:31,260
Everything is fucked.

1794
03:17:31,380 --> 03:17:32,200
Everybody sucks.

1795
03:17:32,500 --> 03:17:36,760
You don't really know why, but you want to justify ripping
someone's head off.

1796
03:17:36,980 --> 03:17:38,280
No human contact.

1797
03:17:38,560 --> 03:17:40,780
And if you interact, your life is on contract.

1798
03:17:40,800 --> 03:17:43,680
Your best bet is to stay away, Motherfucker!

1799
03:17:44,080 --> 03:17:53,240
It's just one of those days It's all about he says, she says
bullshit I think you better quit, let shit slip Or you'll be

1800
03:17:53,240 --> 03:17:54,320
leaving with a bad limp!

1801
03:17:54,800 --> 03:18:03,480
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit I think you
better quit, talkin' that shit It's just one of those days,

1802
03:18:03,560 --> 03:18:09,540

with a blood stain Down right, I'm a maniac, you better

It's to stay away, motherfucker!

1805
03:18:25,520 --> 03:18:26,460
I think you better quit!

1806
03:18:26,660 --> 03:18:32,300
Let's shit play by the means and she says bullshit!

1807
03:18:36,430 --> 03:18:37,070

1808
03:18:37,230 --> 03:18:38,390

And if my day keeps going this way, I just might break
something tonight.

I'm afraid of how that sounded, to be honest, but I'm afraid
of how that sounded.

1835
03:21:44,510 --> 03:21:50,870
I'm just, sometimes I listen back on my karaoke's to see
like, oh, I should adjust this or change that or whatever,

1836
03:21:51,090 --> 03:21:51,190
whatever.

1837
03:21:52,290 --> 03:21:55,150
I don't think I'm going to listen back to this one.

1838
03:21:56,830 --> 03:21:59,830
I don't think I'm going to listen back to this one.

1839
03:22:00,090 --> 03:22:00,410
Okay.

1840
03:22:01,230 --> 03:22:03,710
Actually, that's 35 songs.

1841
03:22:04,810 --> 03:22:06,370
Maybe we should keep it at 35.

1842
03:22:07,250 --> 03:22:08,370
An even number.

1843
03:22:09,270 --> 03:22:11,150
Not even, but, you know, a clean number.

1844
03:22:11,710 --> 03:22:12,510
A clean number.

1845
03:22:16,910 --> 03:22:21,270
Just wait until you see me sing that song in 3D.

1846
03:22:22,090 --> 03:22:22,570
I think.

1847
03:22:23,290 --> 03:22:27,730
I think it might be, you know.

1848
03:22:31,250 --> 03:22:32,670
Might be really funny.

1849
03:22:32,690 --> 03:22:33,290
to watch.

1850
03:22:36,090 --> 03:22:36,890
Oh, man.

1851
03:22:39,490 --> 03:22:41,290
So, oh, my chat just broke.

1852
03:22:42,230 --> 03:22:42,230
Okay.

1853
03:22:43,270 --> 03:22:44,930
What you got against 36, huh?

1854
03:22:46,590 --> 03:22:47,670
Okay, fine.

1855
03:22:47,890 --> 03:22:48,810
I guess we'll just do it.

1856
03:22:49,190 --> 03:22:50,790
Even though my throat hurts a little bit.

1857
03:22:51,470 --> 03:22:51,730
What?

1858
03:22:51,830 --> 03:22:52,470
My throat hurts?

1859
03:22:52,490 --> 03:22:53,250
That'd be crazy.

1860
03:22:53,730 --> 03:22:55,330
No, I can keep going.

1861
03:22:55,810 --> 03:22:57,390
I can keep going.

1862
03:23:02,220 --> 03:23:22,380
The emo anthem has gun and I was a young ghost my father
took me into the city to see a marching band he said son

1863
03:23:22,380 --> 03:23:37,840
when you grow up would you be the savior of the broken the
beaten and the damned he said will you defeat them Your

1864
03:23:37,840 --> 03:23:53,280
demons and all the non-believers The plan that they have
made Because one day I'll leave you Mint Phantom To lead you

1865
03:23:53,280 --> 03:23:58,340
in the summer To join the Black Parade

1866
03:25:00,170 --> 03:25:14,250
Feel like I should go Do it all, the rise upon the bodies in
the streets And when you're all, we'll carry on

1867
03:25:34,240 --> 03:25:43,660
Depends you reeling from decimated dreams Your misery and
hate will kill us all Into

1868
03:25:49,350 --> 03:25:53,130
the end we'll hear the call The

1869
03:26:18,980 --> 03:26:21,460
pointed faces of your peers

1870
03:26:43,430 --> 03:26:47,630
I'm gonna show my scar, give a tear For all the broken,

1871
03:26:52,120 --> 03:26:56,940

1909
03:29:37,380 --> 03:29:40,220
My, I'm like, my voice is just so bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl.

03:29:47,920 --> 03:29:49,480
way of saying, I just shouldn't.

1912
03:29:49,880 --> 03:29:50,240
Oh my God.

1913
03:29:50,340 --> 03:29:50,780
