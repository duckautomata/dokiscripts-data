00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,210
Hi!

2
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,630
Suddenly really self-conscious.

3
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,530
What was that?

4
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,860
This is my documentary.

5
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,780
Hold on.

6
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,060
Look.

7
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,640
Look.

8
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,280
Look.

9
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,440
Look.

10
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:01,660
Look.

11
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,180
Me.

12
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,180
Look.

13
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,880
Look.

14
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,400
Look.

15
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,380
Look.

16
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:11,980
Look.

17
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,280
Look.

18
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,600
Look.

19
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:13,720
Look.

20
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Look.

21
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:13,960
Look.

22
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,020
Look.

23
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,680
Me.

24
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,040
Me.

25
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,930
Why the doki looks so flat?

26
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,210
Because I haven't gotten a pillow for it yet.

27
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,270
So he's flat right now.

28
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,570
Because I haven't gotten a pillow for him yet.

29
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,070
Is that tea on the left?

30
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:39,750
It is!

31
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,830
It's my tea!

32
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,590
Yippee!

33
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,570
It's my tea!

34
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,130
It's my tea!

35
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,590
I'm drinking Gamma-micha as I always do.

36
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,570
It's in my favorite mug even.

37
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,610
Look at my finger.

38
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,590
It's so lumpy.

39
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,740
Lumpy finger.

40
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,830
Can I have a sip?

41
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,910
No.

42
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,210
Can you give us a smooch, please?

43
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,370
Why?

44
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,230
The glove is bigger than you.

45
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,330
These are pretty...

46
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,180
Why is it so lumpy?

47
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,120
Like... You see this?

48
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,800
Look at this!

49
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,300
Wait.

50
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:53,780
Wait.

51
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,710
Do I have another pair?

52
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,270
Hold on.

53
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,340
Goodbye, gloves.

54
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,940
Goodbye, lumpy gloves.

55
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,560
Oh, I will move my...

56
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,040
Oh, I think I forgot to tweet.

57
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,920
I will move my keyboard once I...

58
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,000
Once I am prepared.

59
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,140
There we go!

60
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,600
That's much better.

61
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,060
I don't know how I would do anything with those other gloves.

62
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,060
Wow!

63
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,260
Hold on also.

64
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,510
There we go.

65
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,740
Lumpy no more!

66
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,400
Just a little bit.

67
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,880
Just a little bit lumpy.

68
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,780
Lumpy no more!

69
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,120
Nice desk?

70
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:13,820
Thank you!

71
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,540
Welcome to my...

72
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,600
Streaming desk.

73
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,420
And such.

74
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,720
Hold on.

75
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,480
Don't look at that.

76
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,720
Yeah.

77
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,720
As you can see...

78
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,320
I like...

79
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,060
Cinnamoroll.

80
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,460
Small, cute.

81
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,740
Chuu!

82
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,180
Chuu!

83
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,980
My Oshii has lumpy hands.

84
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,400
No!

85
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,740
Why do you have the extra lumpy gloves?

86
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,560
Well, I didn't buy them with the intent of them...

87
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,280
Oh, I need to tweet.

88
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,560
With the intent of them being lumpy.

89
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,140
Twitter.

90
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,260
Haunting now.

91
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,160
Tweet.

92
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,120
Oh my gosh, you guys saw me live tweet.

93
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,980
Yeah, look at this.

94
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,100
When I tweet...

95
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,140
No, not when I tweet.

96
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,020
When I type...

97
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,800
It does the thing where like...

98
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,080
So...

99
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,180
It turns the color...

100
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,740
Of what I type.

101
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,220
So, look at the T.

102
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,340
Yeah, it's fantastic.

103
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,000
And then...

104
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,960
You guys probably can't see...

105
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,380
My...

106
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,120
Escape key.

107
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,720
It's not focusing.

108
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,780
But my escape key is Minto.

109
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,580
My escape key is Minto.

110
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,900
Focus camera, focus.

111
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,980
It's okay.

112
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,880
I'm using a different webcam today.

113
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,700
So, I'm not quite used to it.

114
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,320
Thanks for the three months of fun from a lurker.

115
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,760
Devanna, thank you.

116
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,720
It's blurry, but it's cute.

117
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah.

118
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,420
I got it from...

119
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,660
Offky.

120
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,420
Sorry, I don't remember the artist.

121
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,300
I'm so sorry.

122
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,820
She said...

123
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:19,980
Chu.

124
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:25,900
Anyway...

125
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,640
Let's put my keyboard somewhere.

126
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,300
Because I'm not going to be needing it.

127
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,320
Today.

128
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,840
Or...

129
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,320
At this moment.

130
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,390
Mint's lumps.

131
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,190
Her lovely finger lumps.

132
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,110
Check them out.

133
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,290
I drive...

134
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,950
I drive these...

135
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,990
Ghosties crazy.

136
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,090
I do it on the daily.

137
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,890
They treat me really nice.

138
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,850
And they buy me lots of Icy's.

139
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,260
Hold on.

140
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,340
Cheese.

141
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,380
Cheese.

142
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,600
Cheese.

143
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,440
I put it on a looping...

144
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,140
Or not a looping.

145
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,100
I put it on like a playlist.

146
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,140
Rather than...

147
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,580
One singular BGM.

148
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,520
But if it gets distracting, just let me know.

149
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:25,980
Cheese.

150
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,000
Cheese.

151
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,660
Hold on.

152
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,380
I can give myself bunny ears.

153
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,440
Cheese.

154
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:33,780
Cheese.

155
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,620
Cheese.

156
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,380
I'm going to die.

157
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:36,580
Cheese...

158
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,140
Cheese.

159
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,000
Cheese.

160
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,340
CHEESE!!!

161
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,060
Yes, and my tea.

162
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,840
Sh spiritual.

163
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,560
I remember the one time I sent my new keyboard...

164
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,300
And one of my keys came flying off.

165
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,300
That was the day I truly lost control.

166
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,280
Let's get a...

167
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,220
Let's get out of here.

168
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,000
Chat summary auto-generated experiment.

169
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,840
Quality may vary.

170
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:26,460
Vtubers are talking about the streamer's cute Minto keyboard and are excited about the possibility of a concert or single release.

171
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,160
Yes!

172
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:35,160
I was earlier on Doki's stream and we announced that we'll be doing...

173
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,900
She's at, what is it, Anirivo, I think?

174
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,760
And we'll be doing a concert together!

175
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,280
And so...

176
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,240
YAY!

177
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,140
We're doing a concert together!

178
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,080
She invited me!

179
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,800
I was like, wow, really?

180
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,540
Me?

181
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,500
Oh my god!

182
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,500
So...

183
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:14,440
Yeah, if you didn't watch, I was on her stream earlier and we announced that and we did some VR chat shenanigans.

184
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,520
I felt really bad though.

185
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:28,260
I'm sorry if I felt maybe a little low energy in it because I put on my headset and immediately...

186
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,340
Don't tell her, don't tell her I said this, but I immediately felt so sick.

187
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:41,380
I'm like okay so, and I kinda mentioned it on the stream too but five minutes before hand...

188
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:49,620
I was- I was spending like two hours trying to get my VR chat model to work.

189
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:50,940
Um..

190
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,740
And I was like, maybe even more than two hours I don't even know.

191
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,680
And it just wouldn't work at all and I was like freaking out and I really freaked myself out.

192
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,380
Until like...

193
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:18,460
And then once it all worked out, it kind of came down, but my brain hurt, and so then when I put on, and I hadn't eaten, so when I put on the headset, I was like, oh no, I think I've got to be sick, and so I felt really, so sorry if I was low energy, but I was really excited,

194
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,660
and I love doing stuff in VR chat, so...

195
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,580
VR do be discombobulating.

196
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,240
By the end, I was like, oh my god, I think I might pass away.

197
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,020
Again, this is my brain thoughts.

198
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,020
They're coming from my head.

199
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,990
Might pass away again.

200
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:52,630
But, yeah, we're gonna be doing that together.

201
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,670
Yeah.

202
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,070
Couldn't tell you were low energy?

203
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,950
Yeah!

204
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

205
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,270
I'm like, I'm like...

206
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:06,710
85%.

207
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,030
Yeah.

208
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,370
Look at this little guy.

209
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,790
Isn't he so cute?

210
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,610
Emory got him for me.

211
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,850
A long time ago, actually.

212
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,410
She was like, it's literally you.

213
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,010
It's a ghost in heaven.

214
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,810
Look how cute.

215
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,510
Oh, oh wait, it's upside down.

216
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,870
Look how cute he is.

217
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,170
Got the wings and everything.

218
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,970
So he sits on my desk.

219
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,590
What else do I have on my desk?

220
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,030
That's exciting.

221
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:43,470
Oh, I have this, which is my Steins Gate calendar that I haven't up, it's a block calendar, but I haven't updated it.

222
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,630
Yeah, I haven't updated it.

223
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,290
So the numbers are all wrong, but I keep it here and I look at it.

224
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,410
And what else do I have?

225
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,970
Oh, I have my, my bag of yen.

226
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:08,990
Well, I recently, originally it's a blue, oh, it's a blue archive bag, but I put my yen in it because I was like, oh, now I have a coin purse.

227
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,350
I'll be going back soonish.

228
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:16,210
So my bag of yen, it wasn't originally on my desk, but why is it on my desk?

229
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:20,530
I have, um, my Ayami coaster.

230
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,310
I don't use it.

231
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,530
I just like to look at it.

232
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,450
And I have, oh, I don't know if I ever showed this before.

233
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,370
Actually, I'm going to take it out of the sleeve real quick.

234
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:40,970
Um, so that, uh, you can see it maybe better.

235
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:48,050
Actually, Ayami drew this for me and gave it to me at, um, Anime Central.

236
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,590
I don't know if I ever showed you guys before.

237
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,590
It's so cute though, right?

238
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:59,710
Sorry that it's not focusing very well, but it's so cute.

239
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,410
Push, push.

240
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,970
It's so cute, Ayami-sensei.

241
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,330
Look, she even gave me earrings.

242
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,050
I just noticed.

243
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,910
A little ghostly earring.

244
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,710
So cute.

245
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,750
So cute.

246
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:16,950
Yeah.

247
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,200
Um, first time we've seen.

248
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:21,760
Yeah.

249
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,640
I have lots of stuff on my desk.

250
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,520
What else do I have on here?

251
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,140
I can show you guys.

252
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,340
Well, that's not on my desk.

253
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,860
I actually have that, like, kind of displayed.

254
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,900
Okay, you know what?

255
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,820
The background changing is annoying me.

256
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,580
I don't want to, I don't like it anymore.

257
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,980
Um, what one did I just have it on?

258
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,240
No.

259
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,400
No.

260
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,420
No.

261
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,340
I'll do this one.

262
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,520
Oh no!

263
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,080
I got rid of my...

264
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,000
Okay.

265
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,520
No figures on my desk?

266
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,420
No, I keep my figures in a...

267
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,500
In a...

268
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,820
Store in... in glass.

269
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,700
In its own place.

270
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,500
Display case!

271
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,500
Display case!

272
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,980
I actually...

273
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,500
They're not figures though.

274
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,160
I have a lot of acrylic stands in here.

275
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,940
Oh my gosh, I have these?

276
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,260
Hold on.

277
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,800
I was cleaning earlier.

278
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,680
I have...

279
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,880
I have blue eyes, white dragon, cinnamorolls.

280
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,280
I got both of these from Ofcai actually.

281
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,220
Someone gifted them.

282
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,820
I think two different people gifted them to me.

283
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,740
Which they're so funny looking.

284
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
They're so cute!

285
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:05,880
Why?

286
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,920
Because I love blue eyes, white dragon and I love cinnamorolls!

287
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,700
Obviously!

288
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,360
Obviously!

289
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,240
Now I need a third.

290
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:17,660
I know!

291
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,440
I can become Seto Mintba.

292
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,600
Yeah...

293
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,420
So if anyone has one and wants to give it to me...

294
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,320
But these two can kiss.

295
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,080
Are they still coming out in the U.S.?

296
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,660
Oh, I don't know!

297
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,800
I think they were announced for the U.S.

298
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,120
actually.

299
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,020
But yeah, whoever got me these, thank you!

300
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,720
I have them with me.

301
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,920
Oh gosh.

302
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,020
This is just becoming like me showing off my stuff.

303
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,760
That's kind of fun, right?

304
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,280
I never get to... I think this...

305
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,900
Besides... besides the pachinko...

306
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,920
I think this is my first ever hand cam.

307
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,680
ViviCore, thanks for the gift!

308
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,180
Thank you!

309
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,320
Thank you, thank you!

310
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,040
Wait...

311
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,900
Thank you, thank you!

312
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,620
I think it's my first... I think it's my first...

313
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,010
I'm nervous.

314
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,350
I'm nervous.

315
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,330
What is this?

316
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,330
But today we're building a thing.

317
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,390
Today we're building...

318
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,030
I mean, I have the box right next to me as you can see.

319
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,770
But I will show you this box as well.

320
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,550
Sakura Densha.

321
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,910
So basically, there's like this...

322
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,950
I guess it's a...

323
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,930
A fad.

324
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,030
It's like a...

325
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,350
It's like... it's really popular now.

326
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,450
To get these...

327
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,830
Like bookshelf inserts that are very... that are like little miniature worlds.

328
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,990
Like a book nook.

329
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:14,270
Yeah!

330
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,710
Welcome to membership.

331
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,010
Thank you!

332
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:20,870
But yeah...

333
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,750
So...

334
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,050
We're going to be making this one.

335
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,870
The one that I got.

336
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,610
They had other ones too.

337
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,470
I don't remember what the other ones were.

338
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,010
But I really liked the train.

339
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,210
So I wanted the train.

340
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,150
Book diorama.

341
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

342
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,370
And then all the gnomes that live in my house can all like...

343
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,430
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

344
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,310
They can take the train to...

345
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,350
Wait, are those people in there?

346
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,950
Oh my god!

347
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:49,850
There's actual people!

348
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,110
On the train!

349
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,830
It says here...

350
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,770
Sakura Nodensha.

351
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,910
She got gnomes.

352
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,630
There's like everything in this...

353
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,670
maid cafe.

354
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,610
But yeah!

355
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,090
So I already unboxed it.

356
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,630
Here's our instructions everybody.

357
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:17,250
With Sakura fluttering in the sky...

358
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,350
Whisper your name...

359
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,410
over and over.

360
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,070
Wait, what?

361
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,590
I just read that for the first time just now.

362
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,520
Mento, Mento...

363
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:27,700
What?

364
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:28,560
Hmm?

365
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:29,680
Huh?

366
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,020
Abby!

367
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,390
Why?

368
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,570
Why so many gifted?

369
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,410
Makes my...

370
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,770
wrist look thick.

371
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,430
Why?

372
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,530
Thank you.

373
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,870
Thank you.

374
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:54,150
Thank you.

375
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,250
Thank you.

376
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,030
Thank you.

377
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,170
Thank you.

378
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:57,630
Thank you.

379
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:58,770
Thank you.

380
00:21:58,770 --> 00:21:59,270
Thank you.

381
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:00,610
Thank you.

382
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:00,790
Thank you.

383
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:00,950
Thank you.

384
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,350
Thank you.

385
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,850
Thank you.

386
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,750
Thank you.

387
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,110
Thank you.

388
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,010
Thank you.

389
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,090
Thank you.

390
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,150
Thank you, thanks for the vibe!

391
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:19,450
Why?

392
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:24,720
Why?

393
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,320
Why?

394
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,680
Why?

395
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,100
Why?

396
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,420
Why?

397
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:27,580
Why?

398
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,620
All must become wisp.

399
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,220
Thank you for the vibe.

400
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,560
No, I'm just kidding.

401
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,520
David, thank you for the vibe.

402
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,140
Thank you!

403
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,120
Should be as tall as a book.

404
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,940
I have a book, hold on.

405
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,280
How tall do you think?

406
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:21,960
Like this one?

407
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,280
Like this one?

408
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,920
Oh, they're basically the same height.

409
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,600
This is the Metal Gear Solid 4.

410
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,020
That's why it says, Saraba Snake.

411
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,680
Goodbye Snake.

412
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,780
Farewell Snake.

413
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,420
And then this one's Metal Gear Solid 2, but it's in English.

414
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,960
This one, Nihongo.

415
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,720
But I also own the English version of this too.

416
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,220
Oh my gosh.

417
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,280
Alan!

418
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,740
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

419
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,420
Thank you!

420
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,080
And Woda!

421
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,680
Woda the hedgehog.

422
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,660
Thank you for the 5 gifted.

423
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,460
Thank you so much!

424
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,340
Did I miss anybody?

425
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,280
C2, thanks for the 5!

426
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
Oh my gosh, wait, there's so many!

427
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,620
Jessens, thank you for the 50!

428
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,400
You guys, I can't just be...

429
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,820
Scarlet, thank you for the 5.

430
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,700
Thank you so much.

431
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,260
Thank you, thank you.

432
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,420
Yurien, thank you for the 5!

433
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,140
Thank you, thank you!

434
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,380
Oh my gosh!

435
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,660
Teacup, thank you for the 5!

436
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,220
Thank you!

437
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,680
I think I got all of them.

438
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,440
You missed a flood.

439
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,660
What the hell?

440
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,500
Run it!

441
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,420
Thank you for the 20!

442
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,300
Okay.

443
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,950
So this is our instruction manual today.

444
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,570
Like so.

445
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,470
Is this...

446
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:03,820
Oshama!

447
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,200
Thank you for the 5!

448
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,960
Thank you!

449
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,940
Anyribo is local.

450
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,380
Let's go!

451
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,320
See you there then.

452
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,800
They wanted to see if I could do like a meet and greet and even two.

453
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,760
But I was like, I have another convention that same weekend unfortunately.

454
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,880
So the timing...

455
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,720
The timing...

456
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,980
Maybe one day I'll be invited as an actual guest.

457
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,580
So...

458
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:31,760
Hmm...

459
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,680
Oh my gosh.

460
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,600
Oh my gosh!

461
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:37,840
Hold

462
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,990
on, I'm gonna move my tea over here.

463
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,670
Oh my gosh.

464
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:51,790
Wait, hold on.

465
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,470
Oh my gosh.

466
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,690
Wait, hold on.

467
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,310
Wait, there's too many...

468
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:57,690
Wait, hold on.

469
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:58,590
Oh my god.

470
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,390
Mr. Obese, thank you.

471
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,570

00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,290
Thank you for the 50!

474
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,160
Thank you for the 10!

475
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,480
Got the same book nook for another wisp about a year ago.

476
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,240
No way, really!

477
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,020
Thank you for the 5!

478
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,920
Oh my gosh.

479
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,640
You guys.

480
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,480

481
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,300

484
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:33,980
You guys!

485
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,890
Chat is now all green.

486
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,810
Oh my gosh.

487
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,950
That doesn't stop!

488
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,130
It doesn't stop!

489
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,570
Please!

490
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,290
Please.

491
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,860
I'm trying to look for...

492
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,420
Hold on, I'm trying to look for my remote for my fan.

493
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,540
I'm just gonna turn it on right here.

494
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,020
I don't know where I put it.

495
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,560
Oh, there it is.

496
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:46,820
Okay.

497
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,500
I found it.

498
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:47,980
I found it.

499
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,400
My little remote.

500
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,200
Oh my gosh, you guys.

501
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,700
I can't even keep up.

502
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,760
I can't even...

503
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,920
YouTube is not even letting me scroll through.

504
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:58,960
Hold on.

505
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,220
Oh my god.

506
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:03,960
Oh my god.

507
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,580
Wait, where did I even leave off at?

508
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,760
I don't even know.

509
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,500
Oh my gosh, there's too many!

510
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,060

Emery, look!

545
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,600
I showed them earlier.

546
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,520
I was like, this is on my desk.

547
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,080
This is on my desk.

548
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,380
Hi, Emery!

549
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,120
I keep it on my desk.

550
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,860
Burberry, Burberry, thank you for the gift.

551
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,980
I'm so happy he's haunting your desk.

552
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,240
Yeah!

553
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,800
Thanks for the turn!

554
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,660
Football, thank you for the turn!

555
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,880
No, thank you, thank you!

556
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,480

Thank you for the five!

559
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,680
I think I've got it.

560
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,540
Nice.

561
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,760
I think I forgot scissors.

562
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,180
Because I have all this.

563
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,200
Oh, it's all in plastic.

564
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,480
One second.

565
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,640
I think I have to go get scissors for it.

566
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,780
Look at all these pieces!

567
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,480
Oh, you can see my computer screen.

568
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,120
Let's see.

569
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,840
Take out some of the stuff.

570
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,600
There's the batteries.

571
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,100
I don't know what this is.

572
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,680
Glue, maybe?

573
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,520
I need scissors 61.

574
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,540
You guys, I forgot scissors.

575
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,400
Actually, I think I need to go get some scissors.

576
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,160
I'll be right back.

577
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,860
I'll be right back.

578
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,140
I'll be right back.

579
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,770
I'm back, baby.

580
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:18,890
I'm back.

581
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,590
Stop, stop!

582
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,170
I was gone for two seconds!

583
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:24,310
Stop, stop!

584
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:24,310
I was gone for two seconds!

585
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,030
Empty gloves?

586
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:29,730
She's a ghost?

587
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:30,450
I know.

588
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,010
I know.

589
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,790
That's what I'm saying.

590
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,310
I know.

591
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:42,310
That's what I'm saying.

592
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:42,490
Scissors.

593
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,310
Let me crack this bad boy open.

594
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:50,770
I'm kind of nervous about making this.

595
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,510
I have to do it carefully, though.

596
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,550
Oh, there we go.

597
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,270
Okay.

598
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,390
Oh, gosh.

599
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,430
Oh, gosh.

600
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,450
Oh, gosh.

601
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:03,430
Why?

602
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,410
Why do I have to wear gloves?

603
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,510
No.

604
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,010
It's so that you guys can see me.

605
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:09,610
You know?

606
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,990
It's my ghostliness.

607
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,270
But it's so hard to open anything!

608
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,470
I actually had no intention of doing this on stream.

609
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,810
I bought it for myself.

610
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,270
But I just kind of never did it.

611
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,530
I was like, I never have time to do it.

612
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,130
Maybe I'll just...

613
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,630
make it on stream, is what I said.

614
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,530
Just do it on stream!

615
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:32,770
Oh my god.

616
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,290
You guys, I'm like...

617
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,310
The hole is right here!

618
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,790
The opening is right there!

619
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:41,710
I just made it!

620
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:42,810
Come on!

621
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:43,710
Come on!

622
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:44,430
Peel!

623
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,090
Peel!

624
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,330
Peel!

625
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:46,410
Peel!

626
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,310
We're doing it live, baby.

627
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:51,690
There we go.

628
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,190
Okay.

629
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,370
There we go.

630
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,150
Plastic on the floor!

631
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,050
Plastic on the floor!

632
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,010
It's okay.

633
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,570
I'm a maid.

634
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,630
I clean it up later.

635
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,490
Plastic!

636
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,610
Plastic!

637
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,710
Can you guys hear it?

638
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,330
Plastic!

639
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,630
Plaster!

640
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:17,970
Plastic!

641
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,690
That's not plastic.

642
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,090
What is this?

643
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:23,930
Actually, what is this?

644
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,370
Huh.

645
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:30,810
Oh my gosh.

646
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:32,770
Yeah!

647
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,410
Why can't I get the rest off?

648
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,730
It smells like...

649
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,910
It smells like wood.

650
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,700
Oh my god.

651
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,520
I'm trying not to break stuff, but...

652
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,500
Give me something to break.

653
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,360
About your...

654
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,040
heckin' plastic.

655
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,240
Alright, we got...

656
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,780
Oh!

657
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,120
This is a sandpaper.

658
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,200
On the stuff.

659
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,100
This is...

660
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,580
Oh!

661
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,700
This is reflective.

662
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:15,380
Oh!

663
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,060
Actually, no.

664
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,600
It's not so bad.

665
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,320
It's a thing.

666
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,400
I thought it was a mirror for a second.

667
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,080
I had a...

668
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,760
I had a little jump scare there.

669
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,320
We have some sakura something-somethings.

670
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,040
I've always wanted to do one of these.

671
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,680
I'm gonna go buy one.

672
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,140
Let's go!

673
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,560
Here's some more thingies.

674
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,880
This reminds me of when I was putting together my... I have a wooden revolver.

675
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,760
Wow!

676
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,740
Look at all the details and stuff!

677
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,060
Wait, this is just... this is thin actually.

678
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:53,920
Oh!

679
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,420
Wait, I think something just fell out.

680
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:56,940
Uh-oh.

681
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,780
Uh-oh.

682
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,100
That part just popped out of that hole.

683
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,500
Oh no, it's too thin!

684
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,240
Uh-oh.

685
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:02,780
Uh-oh.

686
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,420
Okay.

687
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,300
We're all ready.

688
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,680
I'll just put it right back in there.

689
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,300
Oh, shoot.

690
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,280
Um, just... What if I put it in like this?

691
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,200
Nice.

692
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:22,680
Perfect.

693
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,440
Perfection.

694
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,280
Look!

695
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,060
There's the people!

696
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,400
That's...

697
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,100
That's... Wait, can you see it?

698
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,500
Those are the people!

699
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,840
The people.

700
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,700
Uh-huh.

701
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,800
There's a cat!

702
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,280
Look how cute he is!

703
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:53,780
Book...

704
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,480
Oh, stories in books.

705
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,580
Stories...

706
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,340
in books.

707
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,520
Okay.

708
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,320
What do we name him?

709
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,720
We'll name him once we get there.

710
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,340
I think this is the outside of the book, right?

711
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,660
We have some wood...

712
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,680
Oh, this smells...

713
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,140
That's the wood scent.

714
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,580
That's the wood scent.

715
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,160
And... Oh my gosh, there's so many pieces.

716
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,340
I don't think we're gonna finish this today.

717
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,940
Stories in books?

718
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,400
Some more?

719
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,720
And then all of these.

720
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:29,500
Sniffa.

721
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,660
No, this doesn't... This one doesn't...

722
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,600
Gloves are gonna be...

723
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,760
amazing with the glue?

724
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,320
No, the glue is...

725
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:45,900
a pen.

726
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,120
It's a pen.

727
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,880
Rest in glitch days.

728
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,800
Thank you for the five!

729
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,540
Thank you!

730
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,840
It'll be fine.

731
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,380
Until the glue...

732
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,480
gloves... F with the glue?

733
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,480
Oh, no, no, no.

734
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,840
We'll be fine!

735
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,660
Okay, let me put all of this now.

736
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,800
I moved my tea over there, but I'm actually gonna move it over here.

737
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,620
I also have these.

738
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,340
I don't know if I'll need them.

739
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,700
I have some...

740
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,880
some Gundam nips.

741
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,560
Okay.

742
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,040
Alright.

743
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,720
Let's see.

744
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,380
Let's read the instructions and see what we need first.

745
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,260
Let's go.

746
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,600
Stories and stories and stories and stories.

747
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,580
Oh!

748
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,660
We're fine.

749
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,000
My strength has no...

750
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,040
no bounds.

751
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,360
Okay.

752
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,320
This thing... Ruined!

753
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,140
Soiled it!

754
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,940
Soiled it!

755
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,040
Soiled it!

756
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,240
And then this is a battery pack.

757
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,580
Because it actually has lights.

758
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,680
So that's very cool.

759
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,520
I'm gonna put that over there.

760
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,700
I don't know what these are.

761
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,000
I think this... Oh, this looks like a railroad.

762
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,820
And then... parts.

763
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,100
And glue.

764
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,600
Soiled it!

765
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,340
Alrighty.

766
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,500
Let's open our magical book.

767
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,860
Our Ikea instructions.

768
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,500
That's the fence.

769
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:43,860
Oh.

770
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,440
Okay.

771
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,060
Oh.

772
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,380
Equipped with two controllable lights.

773
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,400
Hidden battery.

774
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,840
Colorful world and river reflection.

775
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,120
Oh my gosh!

776
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,360
It's gonna look so good!

777
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,060
Touch... There's a touch light!

778
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,140
How many pages?

779
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,820
Thirty four... Thirty... Thirty three!

780
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,560
Thirty three pages.

781
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:07,860
Look!

782
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,740
They have... Okay.

783
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,600
Sakura Densha.

784
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,460
Densha.

785
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,740
Sunshine Town.

786
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,280
Magic House.

787
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,880
And Time Travel.

788
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,100
Wait!

789
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,960
Time Travel has like a really cool...

790
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,780
Train.

791
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,380
But I think I like Sakura Densha most.

792
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,380
Sunshine Town is pretty cool too.

793
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,300
Magic House?

794
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,900
Looks like you can't see enough of it.

795
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,920
Looks like the border blocks too much of it.

796
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,220
Huh.

797
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,900
But Time Travel looks really awesome.

798
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,460
Sunshine Town does too.

799
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,080
I like the colors in Magic House.

800
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:39,380
Wait.

801
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,040
Oh!

802
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,960
I like the window!

803
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,560
Oh!

804
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,820
It looks really nice actually.

805
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,540
I'm a sucker for trains.

806
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,080
Me too!

807
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:52,800
Oh!

808
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,100
I'm already feeling the pressure here.

809
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,440
Please read Q&A in the previous page before...

810
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:03,580
Oh!

811
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,400
Here's where my favorite ghost mates swarm.

812
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,600
Thank you!

813
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,020
Thank you!

814
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,800
Where's the Q&A?

815
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:12,920
Oh!

816
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,780
What if there are burrs?

817
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,200
What's a burr?

818
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,960
What's a burr?

819
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,200
What's a burr?

820
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,900
On the edges of parts.

821
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,820
On the edges of parts.

822
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,840
Burr.

823
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,320
A sliver?

824
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,300
A fuzzy thing?

825
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,100
A knot?

826
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:41,740
In order to ensure your safety and its installation accuracy, please remove the parts first.

827
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:50,300
Then use the included sandpaper to polish the edge burrs of the parts.

828
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:50,820
Okay.

829
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,420
So if there's any burrs...

830
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,460
We sand those guys out.

831
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,520
How to deal with loose parts after repeated disassembly.

832
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,400
Apply some glue on joints to fix up the parts.

833
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,580
What need to be considered when assembling the pet and mirror?

834
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,520
Remove the films of the pet and mirror before assembling.

835
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,600
Then apply some glue on them and press 5 to 10 seconds...

836
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,440
There is mirrors.

837
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,720
Burr is a piece sticking out.

838
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,940
Thank you!

839
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,140
The 20th!

840
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,860
Thank you so much!

841
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,140
I really really appreciate it.

842
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,160
What need to be considered when connecting the battery box with the light?

843
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,800
Twist the same color...

844
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,660
I'm becoming an electrician?

845
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,940
Twist the same color wires together.

846
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,980
If you connect red with black, it will short out after powering on.

847
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,080
The light cannot work properly.

848
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:44,500
Okay.

849
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,320
Same color, same color, same color.

850
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:47,920
Oh my god.

851
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,560
What if the light cannot work after connecting the battery box with the light?

852
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,580
First check if the wire connection is wrong.

853
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,140
Correct same color wires together.

854
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,360
Check if they have loaded the batteries properly and if the switch is turned on.

855
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,200
Turn off the battery box switch.

856
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,000
Then tear off the insulation tape.

857
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,820
Check the copper wires are broken and reconnect.

858
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,480
I'm gonna start a fire with this.

859
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,240
I think I'm gonna start a fire.

860
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,900
I think I'm gonna start a fire.

861
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,100
Oh god.

862
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,580
How to use the touch light?

863
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:26,380
After assembly, you can touch the switch on the front board lightly and all light beads will be on.

864
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,220
Cool!

865
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,860
Okay, I read the Q&A.

866
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,900
Why do you send me things when your name is like that?

867
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,480
Please.

868
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,520
Thank you for the 10 gifts.

869
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,180
Please mint phantom.

870
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,120
I can't read the rest.

871
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,680
My reading comprehension is so...

872
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,720
They're a real fan?

873
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,540
Is that what we're calling it now?

874
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,040
Alright.

875
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,060
Apply a dab of glue...

876
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,080
Okay, D2...

877
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,280
C3.

878
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,260
D2... Oh gosh.

879
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,920
I have to go through all of these to find...

880
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,640
What?

881
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,280
Oh my gosh.

882
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,500
I have to go through all of these to find D2.

883
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,680
Okay, guys.

884
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,910
Time to find D2.

885
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,590
Any Ds in here?

886
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:31,090
Oh wait.

887
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:32,990
Any Ds in here?

888
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,830
Any Ds in here?

889
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:37,870
No.

890
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,590
These are all numbers, I think.

891
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:43,490
These are all numbers.

892
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,830
D2, D2, D2...

893
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:49,930
Oh my gosh.

894
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:50,730
Everything is coming apart.

895
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:52,690
This is a mess!

896
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:53,530
This is a mess!

897
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,050
Nathan, thank you for the 5 gifts.

898
00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:59,430
Thank you.

899
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:00,950
Where are Ds?

900
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,750
Where are Ds?

901
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:03,330
Where is D?

902
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,870
Oh, I found A!

903
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,050
You guys, this is A.

904
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,170
This is all A.

905
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,230
A1 to A25.

906
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,710
This part is A.

907
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:22,790
And it was C3.

908
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,370
There are some Cs on here.

909
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:28,130
C3?

910
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:30,210
Is this one.

911
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,960
Doesn't look like the picture, though.

912
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,790
Also, which way is this one?

913
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:48,210
Is C3 facing?

914
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,300
It broke.

915
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,380
But it's not even the same shape!

916
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,760
Let's continue onward.

917
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,500
There might be another C3.

918
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,140
Right.

919
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,380
Where is D?

920
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:27,980
This...

921
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,360
This is F.

922
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,220
One job.

923
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:33,980
Shut up!

924
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,760
There's probably another C3.

925
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:39,920
This...

926
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,520
is G.

927
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,900
We are going through the whole alphabet, but we can't find D.

928
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:50,380
This...

929
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,880
This has to be it.

930
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,360
D!

931
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,580
D...

932
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,460
2.

933
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,080
Oh, it's tiny.

934
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:02,760
I feel

935
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,660
like a poltergeist right now.

936
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:15,800
D...

937
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,140
2.

938
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,680
Okay, remember this one is...

939
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,200
D8.

940
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,940
This is D8.

941
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,080
Stick those back in there.

942
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,340
These are all D2s.

943
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,720
Do I do it with every single one of them?

944
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:35,680
Oh yeah, I do.

945
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:36,880
I think.

946
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:42,430
Wait, A...

947
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:44,030
times 2.

948
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:46,750
B times 2.

949
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,470
Just gonna take all of them.

950
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:51,410
There we go.

951
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,530
This is like the most...

952
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:02,710
This is like the worst setup ever.

953
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,150
To be assembling this.

954
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:07,230
Okay.

955
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:08,650
Oh, I forgot.

956
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:09,850
Wait, where was...

957
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:10,330
Oh shoot.

958
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,070
I forgot C.

959
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:13,090
Hold on, I gotta bring back the C3.

960
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:14,050
PO.

961
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:15,670
C3 PO!

962
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,150
So I just take...

963
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:19,690
Huh?

964
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:21,710
I'm confused.

965
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:25,630
It apparently starts it already struggling.

966
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:26,530
No!

967
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:29,730
C3 to D2.

968
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:31,690
And then which...

969
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:33,090
But which way is it facing?

970
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:34,970
Okay, hold on.

971
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:36,050
Get out.

972
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:36,810
Get out of there.

973
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:42,610
I'm gonna sand this guy.

974
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:45,390
He's got some burrs on him.

975
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:46,890
He's got some burrs on him.

976
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:50,470
It took me 12 hours, but I built a whole moving...

977
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,370
wooden...

978
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:52,470
looking...

979
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:56,390
solar system model out of a kit.

980
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:59,130
If I may offer some advice, spite helps.

981
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:00,070
Yeah!

982
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:04,310
I'm the greatest at being spiteful.

983
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:05,830
I'm a ghost after all.

984
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:11,250
It's an orrery, right?

985
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:12,430
I didn't say ovary.

986
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:14,070
You guys put that in my mouth.

987
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:14,630
Orrery.

988
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:19,170
It's a solar orrery.

989
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,070
Oh, wait!

990
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:22,910
Each side is the same color.

991
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:25,170
So we just kind of...

992
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:27,210
Look!

993
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,930
Okay, I gotta glue it.

994
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:35,590
Hold on, I'm also gonna...

995
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,560
Wait, it is that side.

996
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,140
Oh, it doesn't matter which side, I guess.

997
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:55,920
I hope.

998
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:56,680
Actually...

999
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,480
It should matter.

1000
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:00,500
Because...

1001
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,180
Okay.

1002
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,940
I'm looking at the little...

1003
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,160
There's a little...

1004
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,440
This little bugger right there.

1005
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,600
That guy sticking out.

1006
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,540
That needs to be...

1007
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,220
on the...

1008
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,100
I'm gaming, okay?

1009
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:18,700
I'm gaming!

1010
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,500
I know what I'm doing!

1011
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,100
Okay.

1012
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,120
Okay.

1013
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,600
I have a backlog of model kits...

1014
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,380
to build, but was able to...

1015
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,140
finish a cool big old kit.

1016
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,020
What?

1017
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:36,760
Oh.

1018
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,240
Where's my...

1019
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:37,420
glue?

1020
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:37,940
Here it is.

1021
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:41,620
Glue?

1022
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,100
I think I hear birds.

1023
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:49,460
Okay.

1024
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,640
Now, where should I...

1025
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,200
put the glue on?

1026
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,500
Apply a dab of glue on shaded areas.

1027
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,160
Oh, the...

1028
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,820
The rim, the rim, the rim.

1029
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,220
Ooh.

1030
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:05,520
Okay.

1031
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,220
Wait, does this need to be cut?

1032
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,120
Oh.

1033
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:09,620
Wait.

1034
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,080
There's a seal in there.

1035
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:14,840
Wait.

1036
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,440
Oh, okay.

1037
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:16,200
It comes undone.

1038
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:16,900
It comes undone.

1039
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,600
Wait, how do I get the...

1040
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,020
seal?

1041
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:23,720
How do I...

1042
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,500
get the seal out?

1043
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,100
Did they give me...

1044
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:30,480
a poker?

1045
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,580
I hardly even know where...

1046
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,000
Wait.

1047
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,120
Where do I get the...

1048
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:36,340
seal?

1049
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,640
They didn't give me a poker!

1050
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,820
How am I supposed to get the seal out?

1051
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,220
Needle or a pin?

1052
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:49,680
Needle or a pin?

1053
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,120
I have my sensei pin.

1054
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,000
But I don't think it's long enough.

1055
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,320
I have my blue archive sensei pin.

1056
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:58,260
I have my blue archive sensei pin.

1057
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,800
My shale pin.

1058
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:02,540
Toothpick?

1059
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,980
I don't have that either.

1060
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,140
I don't have that either.

1061
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:09,780
Thumbtack.

1062
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:10,180
Thumbtack.

1063
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,920
Oh wait, maybe if I go in from the inside with it.

1064
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,800
Oh wait, maybe if I go in from the inside with it.

1065
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,260
I don't have gloves for this.

1066
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,840
This is making me want to build my...

1067
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,160
MGS Rex model kit.

1068
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,060
Okay.

1069
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,080
Okay.

1070
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,500
I'm gonna try.

1071
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,220
I think it'll work.

1072
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,620
Almost?

1073
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:47,920
Go sensei!

1074
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:48,100
Go!

1075
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:48,380
Go!

1076
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,320
Go sensei!

1077
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,780
I think it's working.

1078
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,060
I think it's working.

1079
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,800
I got it!

1080
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,780
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1081
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,820
Yes, sensei!

1082
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,060
Sensei!

1083
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,280
Sensei!

1084
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,200
Yes!

1085
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:08,680
Alright, nice.

1086
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,240
Building along with Yamito, but mine's...

1087
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,460
a Lego bonsai tree set.

1088
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:14,260
Oooh!

1089
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,950
Are you guys ready to craft with Minto?

1090
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:28,950
Are you guys ready to craft with Minto?

1091
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:30,050
We're crafting together.

1092
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:35,430
You're an indie Vtuber?

1093
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:38,350
I wear them because I'm a ghost.

1094
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:40,030
Not because I'm an indie Vtuber.

1095
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:45,130
Otherwise you wouldn't be able to see my hands.

1096
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:45,970
Otherwise you wouldn't be able to see my hands.

1097
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:47,870
Because I'm a ghost.

1098
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:49,490
Okay.

1099
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:50,210
Alright.

1100
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:56,950
What sucks is, for you guys to see, and for me to do this, it's kinda far away.

1101
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:58,710
So, um...

1102
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:01,870
Uh...

1103
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:04,870
Um...

1104
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:06,550
Uh...

1105
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,170
So, um...

1106
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:11,730
I can't see very well.

1107
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:13,810
Am I doing it well?

1108
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:15,410
Am I putting it on nice?

1109
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:16,690
I hope so.

1110
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,130
God, my hands are kinda shaky.

1111
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:23,450
I hope so.

1112
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,170
Oh, I'm getting glue on my gloves.

1113
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,330
Just like you guys predicted.

1114
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,040
Oh gosh, I'm getting it...

1115
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:33,260
Oh gosh, I'm getting it...

1116
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,500
You guys, I'm getting it in other places that's...

1117
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,380
Okay.

1118
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,500
There we go!

1119
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:38,900
Perfect!

1120
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:50,920
Oh, yeah!

1121
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,000
Just mix it in.

1122
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:53,740
Just mix it in.

1123
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,000
Just mix it in.

1124
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,100
Just mix it in.

1125
00:53:59,100 --> 00:53:59,460
That... Oh.

1126
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,740
Oh, it's on the sides.

1127
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,320
Oh, it's leaking.

1128
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:05,100
It's leaking.

1129
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:06,040
It's leaking.

1130
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,000
It's on the sides.

1131
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:07,380
It's leaking.

1132
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,460
It's okay.

1133
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,460
Just mix it in.

1134
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:11,760
It's okay.

1135
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,120
Just mix it in.

1136
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,940
Don't see the glue on the...

1137
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,260
Don't look at the...

1138
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,820
I hope that dries clear.

1139
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,080
Actually, hold on.

1140
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:24,700
Sensei!

1141
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,460
Sensei!

1142
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,180
Sensei can scrape it out.

1143
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:31,780
Sensei can scrape it out.

1144
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:32,880
I love sensory pins!

1145
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,840
I love sensory pins!

1146
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,320
And just wipe it on my gloves.

1147
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,440
I'll put them in the wash later.

1148
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:39,880
I'll put them in the wash later.

1149
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:41,080
I'm a maid.

1150
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:41,460
It's fun.

1151
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,700
It just looks like it's leaking a little.

1152
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:45,860
It just looks like it's leaking a little.

1153
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,340
Like they have a problem.

1154
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,880
Like some sort of...

1155
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,840
Some sort of problem.

1156
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:53,500
Okay!

1157
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,780
Do I do that for all of them?

1158
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,040
Oh, assemble two sets of parts.

1159
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,620
Alright, we gotta do that again.

1160
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,780
For another set.

1161
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:04,820
Okay.

1162
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,720
Sensei is leaking?

1163
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,300
No, I think...

1164
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:12,940
Maybe actually.

1165
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,560
Okay.

1166
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:18,750
Wait.

1167
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:24,830
I think...

1168
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:25,150
I think...

1169
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:36,460
Yes!

1170
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:36,800
Wait.

1171
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:38,860
I'm confused.

1172
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,760
I put it on the back here.

1173
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,420
Hold on.

1174
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:47,640
Okay, I'm confused.

1175
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,480
So, remember how I said like...

1176
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,000
Oh...

1177
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,400
The notch is on the left side here.

1178
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,340
Right there.

1179
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,140
So I put it on the...

1180
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,880
Left side is here as well.

1181
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,020
But then here...

1182
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,520
It's on...

1183
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:05,960
The left side.

1184
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,200
But it's showing...

1185
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,640
Put the glue on the shaded area.

1186
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:13,380
Huh?

1187
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,300
But then here...

1188
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,520
Did I mess up?

1189
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,200
Did I mess up?

1190
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,620
No, it's the same thing.

1191
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,060
Wait, huh?

1192
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,080
Is it two different ones?

1193
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,140
Maybe it's the same thing, but...

1194
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,140
Maybe it's the same thing, but...

1195
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,700
Oh, I think I assembled two of each.

1196
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,460
Oh!

1197
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,480
I assembled two of this one.

1198
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,680
And then I assembled two of this way.

1199
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:48,580
We're okay.

1200
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,820
We're okay.

1201
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,580
So I need to make another one...

1202
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,740
Where the notch is on the right.

1203
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,700
And then I make two...

1204
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,740
Where the notch is on the left.

1205
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,480
Because it says here...

1206
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,500
Assemble two of sets of parts.

1207
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,880
And then here it says assemble two of sets...

1208
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,480
Yes!

1209
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:08,260
I was nervous for a second.

1210
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,800
So this guy will be facing this way.

1211
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,800
These guys will be facing that way.

1212
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:13,760
Yeah.

1213
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:18,360
Where's my C?

1214
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,000
There we go.

1215
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,320
C3...

1216
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:27,780
C3... C3...

1217
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,360
C3...

1218
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:30,840
C3...

1219
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,920
C3... C3...

1220
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,700
Oh my gosh, it fell in between my pants.

1221
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,500
Okay, there we go.

1222
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:38,840
C3...

1223
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,460
C3... C3... C3... C3...

1224
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:42,580
C3...

1225
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:46,580
She's gaming.

1226
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,800
So yeah.

1227
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,860
Ghost wear pants.

1228
00:57:59,120 --> 00:57:59,720
Yeah.

1229
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:01,640
My ghost pants.

1230
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,860
My uh...

1231
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:04,960
Ectopantoms.

1232
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:06,820
Duh.

1233
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:08,500
Duh.

1234
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:13,530
Ghost... IRL ghost gaming.

1235
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:16,210
Oh yeah, you're pink!

1236
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:16,790
Thank you!

1237
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:18,670
Asto!

1238
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:20,730
I got another gifted membership.

1239
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,030
I can't buy myself.

1240
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:22,670
Thanks guys.

1241
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:23,410
Congratulations!

1242
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:27,670
You won the...

1243
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,870
The ghost...

1244
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:30,190
The membu lottery.

1245
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,730
Natara always told us you're a maid uniform.

1246
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:36,270
I am.

1247
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:38,850
But sometimes I have...

1248
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:40,190
Pants on.

1249
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:42,710
Duh.

1250
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:44,390
It's like normal.

1251
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:46,510
Okay.

1252
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:47,830
Shoop.

1253
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:48,970
Shoop.

1254
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:51,470
Ah!

1255
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:55,810
I can hear a good storm approaching.

1256
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:56,470
Woo!

1257
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:58,930
This isn't the first Super Chat saying so.

1258
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:00,610
And won't be the last.

1259
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:01,590
It just arrived.

1260
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,490
What's that one...

1261
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:04,990
You guys ever seen those um...

1262
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:08,750
Those like...

1263
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:10,010
Those like...

1264
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:13,690
They seem like auditions for something but they make no sense.

1265
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:14,570
It's just like...

1266
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:17,210
Honey, you got a storm coming.

1267
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:18,990
And then they do something like...

1268
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:20,710
With their hand...

1269
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:22,850
They're like...

1270
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:31,520
Honey, you got a big storm coming.

1271
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,500
Honey, you got a big storm coming.

1272
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:32,760
Honey, you got a big storm coming.

1273
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,740
Yeah, I don't need friends.

1274
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,800
They just disappoint me.

1275
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,940
Okay, so this is the one we did.

1276
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,460
And we'll do this one.

1277
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:42,840
So we...

1278
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:43,920
Glue this part.

1279
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:46,280
Why?

1280
00:59:58,920 --> 00:59:59,240
Why?

1281
00:59:59,340 --> 00:59:59,940
I didn't even...

1282
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:00,960
I barely even...

1283
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:01,500
Why?

1284
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,380
Okay, okay, okay.

1285
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,060
We can fix this.

1286
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:04,640
We can fix this.

1287
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:11,630
Oh no!

1288
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,860
No, no, no.

1289
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,460
No, I barely even touched it.

1290
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:19,280
Sensei!

1291
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,340
Sensei!

1292
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:21,600
Wait,

1293
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:25,840
where did I put...

1294
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,220
Uh oh.

1295
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:28,040
Uh oh.

1296
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,280
Where did I put Sensei?

1297
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:30,580
Uh oh.

1298
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:31,740
Wait, this is bad because...

1299
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,440
I didn't put the little cap on so it's...

1300
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,260
It's spiky right now.

1301
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,960
I'm not gonna sit on it.

1302
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:38,400
I'm not gonna...

1303
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:41,380
I'm not gonna get a spike up my butt, am I?

1304
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:42,180
Oh gosh.

1305
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:42,760
Wait.

1306
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,580
Oh, I found it.

1307
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,000
I found it.

1308
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,380
I found it.

1309
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,600
I found it.

1310
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:50,120
Okay.

1311
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,620
I gotta get it from the corners.

1312
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:07,020
Which side am I working on?

1313
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:08,620
I think this side.

1314
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,060
Okay, we can do this now.

1315
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:11,120
Okay.

1316
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:16,640
See?

1317
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,520
This is how much pressure I put on before.

1318
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,160
And it exploded.

1319
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,460
On me.

1320
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:55,470
Take the glue.

1321
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:56,250
Smear it.

1322
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:57,290
Take the glue.

1323
01:01:58,370 --> 01:01:59,350
Just eat it up.

1324
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:00,150
Eat up the glue.

1325
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:01,710
Eat up the glue.

1326
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:02,290
Eat up the glue.

1327
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:03,830
Okay, now we get Sensei back.

1328
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:08,370
Which he dropped to the floor.

1329
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:13,010
Trying to pick up with my toes.

1330
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,700
Does anyone else do that?

1331
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,360
They pick up stuff on the floor with their toes?

1332
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,680
Do not eat the glue.

1333
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:24,960
Oh my gosh.

1334
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,440
That was one of my least favorite episodes of the Powerpuff Girls when I was a kid.

1335
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,620
There was an episode where this guy ate glue.

1336
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,620
I think he had a crush on Buttercup.

1337
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,140
But he just like...

1338
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,120
ate the glue?

1339
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,640
And it made me feel so sick every time.

1340
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:41,980
Oh no, it has hair on it.

1341
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,380
It has cat hair on it.

1342
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,380
Okay, we're good.

1343
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:47,800
So now we get the corners.

1344
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,280
Remember that episode?

1345
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:55,400
I think they both ended up eating glue.

1346
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,240
That's my Oshii.

1347
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:58,980
She eats glue.

1348
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:02,120
And your Oshii would eat glue too.

1349
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:10,770
The horrible part about this is I actually want it to look nice.

1350
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:16,810
I want this to look nice because I'm going to put it on my shelf.

1351
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:20,550
I don't want it to be gross and glue.

1352
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:26,370
Wait, how did I do the wrong sign?

1353
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:33,650
How did they end up facing different directions?

1354
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:38,790
Okay, this goes on this side.

1355
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:40,050
Then...

1356
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,040
Oh my god!

1357
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,820
Okay, so we're gluing this side.

1358
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:57,700
Hold on, I gotta sand it down a little bit.

1359
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,240
You guys, this is going to be good.

1360
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:13,140
When I built my revolver I accidentally got almost to the very end and realized it was all backwards and had to take it apart and redo it.

1361
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,160
So you know.

1362
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:21,760
It happens.

1363
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,280
Easy squeeze.

1364
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,560
Easy squeeze, easy squeeze.

1365
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:36,760
Okay, there we go.

1366
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:40,850
Easy squeeze.

1367
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:43,230
Easy squeeze, easy squeeze.

1368
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:45,430
I mean, but truly, who's...

1369
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:46,710
You know what these...

1370
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:49,730
Only the pictures make these look good, right?

1371
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:53,030
Everybody else's always look like, you know, doo-doo garbage.

1372
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,650
So, you know, it'll be character.

1373
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:58,370
Mine might be just a little bit, like, you know...

1374
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:00,150
Um...

1375
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:02,990
A little something.

1376
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:03,850
I don't know.

1377
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:09,530
It's only ever the model pictures that make these look good.

1378
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:12,650
You know, everybody else's also look bad too.

1379
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:13,610
I think, probably.

1380
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:16,230
Probably.

1381
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:18,290
Not probably.

1382
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:19,090
Definitely.

1383
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,220
That's why you buy two.

1384
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,740
It'll be unique.

1385
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:33,200
Yeah!

1386
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,460
It's gonna look like a labyrinth.

1387
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,320
What are you talking about?

1388
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,080
The McDonald's advertising.

1389
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:40,520
Look!

1390
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:41,880
Two of the same!

1391
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:43,180
Two of the same.

1392
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:47,240
Oh...

1393
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,680
Oh, my fingers smell like glue.

1394
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,900
And now this one.

1395
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:02,180
We're on step two, you guys.

1396
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,300
We're almost at step three.

1397
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,280
How many steps are there?

1398
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,540
There were thirty-four pages, and, um...

1399
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,340
Or thirty-three pages.

1400
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:17,540
Oh, and there's only thirty...

1401
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,680
Only thirty-one steps!

1402
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:21,980
We are so good.

1403
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,000
Oh!

1404
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,780
We got this.

1405
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:29,760
We're already on step two... almost three.

1406
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:34,840
Copium supplies have run dry globally.

1407
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:35,540
Stop!

1408
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:39,580
No, that's why I don't allow copium in my chat.

1409
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,940
Because there is no copium here.

1410
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,320
There's no copium in Ba Sing Se.

1411
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:45,340
Okay?

1412
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,040
Everything I speak is real.

1413
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,300
Everything that I say happens.

1414
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,680
I say Minto's gonna do it, I do it.

1415
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,080
No copium in Ba Sing Se.

1416
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:10,660
Yes.

1417
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:15,950
Nice and easy.

1418
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,700
I just gotta get around my fingers.

1419
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,460
There we go.

1420
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:26,060
Beautiful!

1421
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:30,480
Don't mind the glue-covered fingers, okay, everybody?

1422
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:36,220
I hope it's a non-toxic glue.

1423
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:37,620
Probably is, though.

1424
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:39,320
You think?

1425
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,100
Get to wipe the glue off the sides...

1426
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:48,360
and get Sensei in.

1427
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:50,700
Never gonna be able to use this...

1428
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:53,020
this...

1429
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:56,080
pin ever again.

1430
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:06,830
Tool facing this side...

1431
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:09,130
Tool facing this side...

1432
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:10,310
Tool facing this side...

1433
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:11,010
Okay.

1434
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:14,110
Next, we need...

1435
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:15,890
B2...

1436
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:18,250
B3...

1437
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:19,890
B18.

1438
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:22,050
What was B?

1439
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:25,890
Which one was B?

1440
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:28,590
I have A.

1441
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:29,830
I have C.

1442
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:31,770
C...

1443
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:34,130
Step 2 completed!

1444
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:36,570
You guys, we're doing it.

1445
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:38,170
We're doing it.

1446
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:38,330
We're doing it.

1447
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:39,930
We're doing it.

1448
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:42,510
I have G...

1449
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:47,850
I have F...

1450
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:52,070
I have F...

1451
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:52,430
I have...

1452
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:54,030
I have...

1453
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:54,970
I have...

1454
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:57,850
B2, B18, BINGO!

1455
01:08:58,090 --> 01:08:58,610
B2, B18, BINGO!

1456
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,480
3...

1457
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,720
This is the really woody one.

1458
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,800
This is a really good one.

1459
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,160
I have D...

1460
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,400
Did I ever...

1461
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,020
I have...

1462
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,180
I think this must be B.

1463
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:16,820
E?

1464
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:19,500
Where's B?

1465
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,880
I have A?

1466
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,160
Huh?

1467
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:28,200
A...

1468
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,260
D...

1469
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:34,640
Uh...

1470
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,240
Wait...

1471
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,880
Is this actually B?

1472
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:42,860
Oh, it's B?

1473
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,420
I thought it was 3.

1474
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:48,260
Wait...

1475
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:49,980
Look at this.

1476
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:51,540
None...

1477
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:54,240
Okay, you can't see it at all.

1478
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,560
But none of the...

1479
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,680
Okay, so on all the Bs...

1480
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,500
On every single one of them...

1481
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,560
On every single one of them...

1482
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,680
The line isn't filled in.

1483
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:09,480
So it looks like...

1484
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:09,940
Oh, gosh.

1485
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,000
This is the one moment...

1486
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:12,360
That would focus forever.

1487
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:14,220
It looks like 3!

1488
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,880
I'm gonna take a picture of this right now.

1489
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:19,500
With my phone.

1490
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:22,780
I'm taking a picture!

1491
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:25,720
So that you guys believe me!

1492
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:32,520
Oh, the camera looks like B.

1493
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:35,600
Oh, the camera looks like B.

1494
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,080
No!

1495
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,280
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1496
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:52,920
Right here, right here.

1497
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:58,640
Okay.

1498
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,780
I took a picture.

1499
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:00,420
I'll post it later.

1500
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,380
What did I need?

1501
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,400
It looks like...

1502
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,600
It's the lighting.

1503
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:08,560
That's why.

1504
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,960
It's the lighting.

1505
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,320
It's the lighting.

1506
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,120
Where did my other thing go?

1507
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:14,300
Ah!

1508
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:15,820
He fell!

1509
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:24,630
Alright, we're good.

1510
01:11:26,570 --> 01:11:28,490
I need a B2.

1511
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:30,410
Oh, gosh.

1512
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:33,710
I'm gonna use my camera.

1513
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:39,160
I can't tell!

1514
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,100
I'm using my camera!

1515
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:51,870
Oh, gosh.

1516
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:52,510
Hold on.

1517
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:02,300
B...

1518
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:03,160
12?

1519
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:07,940
Is that B1C or B10?

1520
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:11,100
B32?

1521
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:12,540
Oh, wait.

1522
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:14,360
B132?

1523
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,680
I can't tell!

1524
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,580
I seriously can't tell!

1525
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:21,560
Oh, wait!

1526
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:22,480
B1, B2!

1527
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:24,480
I need B2.

1528
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:30,190
Okay, I found B2.

1529
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:30,950
I found it.

1530
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:36,410
I'm fighting for my afterlife over here.

1531
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:39,050
And then I need B3.

1532
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:40,870
Okay, I have both of those.

1533
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:43,730
And now I need B18.

1534
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:45,890
Okay, hold on.

1535
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:47,470
Let's start with getting...

1536
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:48,390
Let's start with getting...

1537
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:51,950
Okay, so this here is B2 and this one is B3.

1538
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:53,050
Okay.

1539
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:54,810
Nice.

1540
01:12:57,370 --> 01:12:57,930
B2.

1541
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:00,570
Some of it came off.

1542
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:04,710
To B2.

1543
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:07,130
Or not to B2.

1544
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:09,050
Okay.

1545
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:09,950
And now B18?

1546
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:15,500
This one.

1547
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,200
Oh, this one.

1548
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,180
This one right here.

1549
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:21,240
It's kind of tricky because it's like...

1550
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:22,800
It's...

1551
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,780
I don't want to break it.

1552
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:24,360
Oh, gosh.

1553
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:24,720
I'm scared.

1554
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:28,220
Oh, gosh.

1555
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:29,480
I'm scared of breaking it.

1556
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:30,340
I'm scared of breaking it.

1557
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:32,580
I'm scared of breaking it.

1558
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,220
I'm scared of breaking it.

1559
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,400
I'm scared of breaking it.

1560
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,580
The eye patch?

1561
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:46,500
You're right.

1562
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,040
That's so funny.

1563
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:49,020
Okay.

1564
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:49,540
Oh.

1565
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:52,200
Oh, gosh.

1566
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:02,900
I'm scared.

1567
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:04,060
I'm trying.

1568
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:07,580
Why do

1569
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,040
they have the tiniest piece?

1570
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:48,440
Or the thinnest piece in the middle?

1571
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:59,310
Why do they have the thinnest piece in the middle?

1572
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:01,270
It's so hard to...

1573
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:03,430
Push it out!

1574
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:14,680
Push it out!

1575
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:15,480
Tiny knife time.

1576
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:18,620
I think my nips are too...

1577
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:19,920
Too thick.

1578
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:26,520
I can't believe I broke it.

1579
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:27,700
I can't believe I broke it.

1580
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,840
I would never survive in Squid Game.

1581
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,160
No!

1582
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:34,320
How

1583
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:40,740
to get it out?

1584
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,080
You'd think that if I broke it, it would come out.

1585
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:44,360
You'd think that if I broke it, it would come out.

1586
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:45,400
It would be nice to me.

1587
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,260
I got it out.

1588
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:21,480
Let me try the glue.

1589
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,800
Let me try the glue.

1590
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:25,100
Let me try the glue.

1591
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:34,790
I do have super glue if I need it, though.

1592
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:35,330
I do have super glue if I need it, though.

1593
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:36,290
I have to go get it, though.

1594
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:44,830
Okay, I'm gonna do this off-camera.

1595
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:47,530
So I can be precise.

1596
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:51,550
So I can be precise.

1597
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:51,970
So I can be precise.

1598
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:52,790
I will do it off-camera.

1599
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:53,550
Okay, hold on.

1600
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,720
It goes like...

1601
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,640
Yeah, we can fix it.

1602
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:07,140
I will put you back together.

1603
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,380
Step 3 or step B?

1604
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:10,660
Stop!

1605
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:16,100
I don't think the glue is strong enough.

1606
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:17,060
But we'll see.

1607
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:19,540
We'll see.

1608
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,820
28 steps to go.

1609
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:22,720
Yup.

1610
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:29,190
I feel like I should go get the super glue.

1611
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:33,590
I feel like I should go get the super glue.

1612
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:36,310
I feel like I should go get the super glue.

1613
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:36,390
I feel like I should go get the super glue.

1614
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:37,810
We could save it.

1615
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:39,970
Maybe.

1616
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:42,590
Maybe.

1617
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:44,430
Okay.

1618
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,300
Okay, I'm holding it.

1619
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:50,540
Hold.

1620
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:51,800
Hold.

1621
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:57,020
No, no, no, it came apart.

1622
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,000
It came apart.

1623
01:17:58,460 --> 01:17:59,040
Hold.

1624
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:01,420
Hold.

1625
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:09,060
I'm holding it.

1626
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,260
I'm holding it.

1627
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:10,780
I'm holding it.

1628
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:11,760
I'm holding it.

1629
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:12,560
Hold.

1630
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:12,960
Hold.

1631
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:18,330
Hold.

1632
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:21,230
Hold.

1633
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:23,310
How long should I hold it for?

1634
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,940
It's a little wobbly.

1635
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:31,340
Oh gosh.

1636
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:32,420
It's a lot of wobbly.

1637
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:33,800
But it's staying together.

1638
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:35,920
I'm gonna hold it for some more.

1639
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:37,120
Hold.

1640
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:37,520
Hold.

1641
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:46,360
Hold.

1642
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:53,360
10 minutes?

1643
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:55,800
10 minutes?

1644
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,600
What will we do for 10 minutes?

1645
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:58,880
What will we do for 10 minutes?

1646
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,780
Let it set for a while.

1647
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,520
Let it set for a while.

1648
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,180
Look though, it's together.

1649
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:09,760
I'll let it sit by itself.

1650
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:10,220
I'll let it sit by itself.

1651
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,900
And think about what it's done wrong.

1652
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:17,830
And think about what it's done wrong.

1653
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:19,570
Oh, but I need to put...

1654
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:19,870
Uh oh.

1655
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:22,730
I need to put these pieces inside the holes.

1656
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:30,060
These diagrams suck.

1657
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:30,900
These diagrams suck.

1658
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:37,150
Okay.

1659
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:39,970
Let's put this over here.

1660
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:42,210
B14.

1661
01:19:43,310 --> 01:19:45,290
Oh, no one needs to go in here.

1662
01:19:46,210 --> 01:19:46,930
Oh wait.

1663
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:48,370
This is the sign, I think.

1664
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:51,570
You can barely read it here though.

1665
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:53,170
Like...

1666
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:54,210
Look at this.

1667
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:57,090
If you think you can't read anything.

1668
01:19:57,190 --> 01:19:59,830
You can kind of see the indents of the letters and stuff.

1669
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:01,350
But that's supposed to say something.

1670
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:03,790
I could only read it with my camera.

1671
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:06,610
Is that even 14?

1672
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:07,830
Yeah, that's B14.

1673
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:08,910
That's the sign.

1674
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:12,730
What it did wrong was falling into your hands.

1675
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:18,050
This is...

1676
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:20,190
This is...

1677
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:21,930
You...

1678
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:25,330
This is wrong slanderous.

1679
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:33,970
I love catching Mint live because it means it's way past my bedtime.

1680
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:34,550
Asia.

1681
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:39,220
But yeah.

1682
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,360
You can barely read it at all.

1683
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,020
Maybe I'll put...

1684
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:44,300
I can't...

1685
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:45,500
Mita...

1686
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:46,680
Mita?

1687
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:50,080
Mi...

1688
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,260
Mi...

1689
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:53,960
Mi...

1690
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:55,440
Mi...

1691
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:00,520
Tala...

1692
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:04,860
I can't read the rest.

1693
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,680
I can't read the rest.

1694
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,080
I can't read the rest.

1695
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:12,660
Mita...

1696
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:12,800
I can't read it.

1697
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:13,800
I'm scared though.

1698
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:14,480
Look at this part.

1699
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:16,780
I'm gonna break that off.

1700
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:17,620
Right there.

1701
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:19,820
I'm gonna break that off.

1702
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:20,240
I think.

1703
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:21,680
Mintara?

1704
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:24,340
No.

1705
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:25,100
No way.

1706
01:21:29,930 --> 01:21:31,830
I'm scared of these parts eventually.

1707
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:33,090
When I have to get to this too.

1708
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:39,830
Maybe I will use my nips.

1709
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:40,930
Okay.

1710
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:42,490
How do I use them?

1711
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:44,290
Push?

1712
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:46,390
No.

1713
01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:47,170
I'm scared.

1714
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:49,310
I'm scared.

1715
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:50,590
I'm scared.

1716
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:57,330
No exacto knife?

1717
01:21:57,670 --> 01:21:57,890
No.

1718
01:21:57,990 --> 01:21:59,430
I don't have an exacto knife.

1719
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:00,750
No.

1720
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:01,090
I don't have an exacto knife.

1721
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:01,950
Oh gosh.

1722
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,600
You mean snips?

1723
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:11,180
Not nips?

1724
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:11,640
No.

1725
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:12,420
They're called nips.

1726
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,980
I'm gonna have the box around here somewhere.

1727
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:24,210
I'm gonna have the box around here somewhere.

1728
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:25,110
They're

1729
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,040
called an entry nipper.

1730
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:34,900
So I just call them my nips.

1731
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:39,670
They're for Gundam.

1732
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:43,670
She's not lying.

1733
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:45,150
Why would I lie?

1734
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:52,430
It's just easier to say nips.

1735
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:56,190
Isn't it?

1736
01:22:57,790 --> 01:22:58,650
Gunpla nips.

1737
01:22:58,750 --> 01:22:59,030
Yeah.

1738
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:03,950
What are you guys thinking of?

1739
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:06,290
Get your heads out of the gutter.

1740
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:08,610
We gotta get this off.

1741
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:10,670
It'll take the 20 minutes to get it off.

1742
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:11,350
That uh...

1743
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:14,170
That it'll take for this to dry.

1744
01:23:15,710 --> 01:23:16,150
Look.

1745
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:17,670
It's a little crooked it feels.

1746
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:20,030
It's a little... It's okay.

1747
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:20,610
Character.

1748
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:22,310
Okay.

1749
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:23,370
Okay.

1750
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:24,070
Okay.

1751
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:24,630
Okay.

1752
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:25,590
Okay.

1753
01:23:26,030 --> 01:23:26,110
Okay.

1754
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:34,720
We did it.

1755
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:36,440
And we have some burrs.

1756
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:41,640
We've got some burrs to take care of.

1757
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:51,510
Nice.

1758
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:57,580
A few burrs.

1759
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:58,400
A few burrs.

1760
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,800
Gundam naming convention strikes again.

1761
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,800
I think it sounds normal.

1762
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:14,900
Yeah!

1763
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:16,120
Yeah!

1764
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:17,140
Oh.

1765
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:17,760
Uh oh.

1766
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:19,720
My gloves are starting to get really sticky.

1767
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:20,300
Look.

1768
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:23,500
You can see them sticking together.

1769
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:30,500
Maybe if you guys give me enough energy I can take them off.

1770
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,260
I don't know yet though.

1771
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,700
My nails are really bad looking.

1772
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:38,940
So I'd be embarrassed.

1773
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:39,340
Yeah.

1774
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:43,480
Okay.

1775
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:45,640
I don't actually understand this part anyway.

1776
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:46,260
Okay.

1777
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:47,580
These guys here.

1778
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:48,780
You.

1779
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,120
You.

1780
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,020
You.

1781
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:53,740
You.

1782
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:56,560
Does this feel as flimsy as before?

1783
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:58,280
Energy.

1784
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,040
Not now.

1785
01:24:59,240 --> 01:24:59,680
Not now.

1786
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,940
It's actually pretty okay.

1787
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,660
It's actually pretty okay I think.

1788
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:05,880
Yeah.

1789
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,720
It's actually not so flimsy anymore.

1790
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,400
Nice.

1791
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:10,120
Yippee!

1792
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:12,760
Jason!

1793
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,160
Welcome to membership!

1794
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:14,800
Thank you!

1795
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:17,080
Thank you!

1796
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,760
Energy!

1797
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,020
Thank you.

1798
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:35,680
Thank you.

1799
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:37,020
Um.

1800
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:39,800
Uh.

1801
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:40,420
Okay.

1802
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,440
So I take B2?

1803
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,660
And B3?

1804
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:48,600
It's the...

1805
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:51,780
Oh shoot.

1806
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:52,660
Which one was B2?

1807
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,780
And which one was B3?

1808
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:54,440
Oh.

1809
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:55,980
B3 is this one.

1810
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:57,820
This one's B3.

1811
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,800
And I'm gonna use my nips to cut this right here.

1812
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:03,520
Nice.

1813
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,140
B2 and B3 go... They kiss?

1814
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:09,380
I think.

1815
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:09,660
Oh.

1816
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:10,860
I'm gonna use them to cut here.

1817
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:12,460
There we go.

1818
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,000
Okay.

1819
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:14,340
They kiss?

1820
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:15,600
They kiss?

1821
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:17,980
The white side on the white side?

1822
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,140
Or they connect?

1823
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:25,380
I think they just kiss.

1824
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:27,520
Actually I'm not quite sure.

1825
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:31,540
I'm not sure of the...

1826
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:34,960
Oh yeah.

1827
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:35,960
I think they kiss.

1828
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:38,480
They kiss like this.

1829
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,760
And then this part goes into these...

1830
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:42,520
holes?

1831
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:49,040
Into these two different holes.

1832
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:55,720
But facing down.

1833
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:57,940
Like that I think?

1834
01:26:59,100 --> 01:26:59,700
Huh?

1835
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:01,660
Huh?

1836
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:03,020
No.

1837
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:05,140
Face this facing.

1838
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:05,460
Huh?

1839
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,660
Kiss kiss for the love...

1840
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,100
Snippers you have are for plastic.

1841
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:15,460
Yeah I know.

1842
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:23,420
And you're really really a modeling knife for this sort of stuff.

1843
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:24,540
No I don't.

1844
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,200
Otherwise they would have provided one.

1845
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:29,780
I'm good.

1846
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:34,420
They kiss?

1847
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:36,080
But what's that?

1848
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:36,620
Hold on.

1849
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:38,140
I need to look at this more closely.

1850
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:39,560
Huh?

1851
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:46,240
Okay.

1852
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:50,460
This makes no sense.

1853
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:54,380
What?

1854
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:56,920
What?

1855
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:58,000
What?

1856
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,140
How is it supposed to look?

1857
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:04,320
What?

1858
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:06,400
Huh?

1859
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,420
How do you go?

1860
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:09,120
Okay wait.

1861
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:16,360
How do you go from sticking it into the hole like see how it's...

1862
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:23,100
Okay it shows them kissing and then you stick it into the hole and then they're sideways!

1863
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:26,440
They're like making a little bird house shape.

1864
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,380
How does that make any sense?

1865
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:30,560
Huh?

1866
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:32,900
Did I get raided?

1867
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:33,980
Thank you for the raid!

1868
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:34,600
Sorry.

1869
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,160
I'm so confused.

1870
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:39,920
They kiss, go to the hole and then become sideways.

1871
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,620
I guess I'm just going to make them side...

1872
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:45,300
Oh!

1873
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:46,240
I get it!

1874
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:47,500
I get it!

1875
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:47,960
I get it!

1876
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:49,880
They make this... this is...

1877
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:50,740
I get it.

1878
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:51,380
I get it.

1879
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:51,820
I get it.

1880
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:52,300
I get it.

1881
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:52,700
I get it.

1882
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:53,380
I get...

1883
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:56,940
I get it!

1884
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:57,680
I get it!

1885
01:28:57,940 --> 01:28:58,520
I get it!

1886
01:28:58,660 --> 01:28:58,780
I get it!

1887
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:01,200
I'm gonna do it with my hands though.

1888
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,520
I'm gonna do it with my hands...

1889
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
I think it will be easier.

1890
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:10,720
She got the hole!

1891
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,500
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1892
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:13,120
I think I get it.

1893
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:13,800
I think I get it.

1894
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:14,480
I think I get it.

1895
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:16,760
No I don't think.

1896
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:17,300
I know.

1897
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:18,240
I know I got it.

1898
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:18,700
I got this.

1899
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:19,000
Okay.

1900
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:20,400
Like that?

1901
01:29:24,890 --> 01:29:26,070
And then like this.

1902
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:33,570
And then, as they kiss, right?

1903
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:35,850
Yeah.

1904
01:29:36,130 --> 01:29:37,390
Then they kiss.

1905
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:41,230
Then there's two holes and then the third hole.

1906
01:29:43,810 --> 01:29:44,770
I'm breaking it!

1907
01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:45,270
I'm breaking it!

1908
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:45,750
I'm breaking it!

1909
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:51,320
It's gonna snap under my fingers.

1910
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:55,660
I'm gaming?

1911
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,340
Yeah, there's a third hole.

1912
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:05,670
Okay, we're gonna do it like this.

1913
01:30:06,290 --> 01:30:06,970
Okay, okay.

1914
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:08,390
I got this, you guys.

1915
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:09,590
I believe.

1916
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:11,130
Do you guys believe?

1917
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:12,650
Do you guys believe?

1918
01:30:13,090 --> 01:30:14,830
Try making the same model and failed.

1919
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:16,130
I wish you better luck than me.

1920
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:17,030
No, Pop!

1921
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:19,890
No, no!

1922
01:30:19,950 --> 01:30:20,750
Don't say that!

1923
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:22,710
Don't say that.

1924
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:23,310
Don't say that.

1925
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:23,950
Don't say that.

1926
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:24,530
Don't say that.

1927
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:27,790
This is my first ever thing that I've ever made.

1928
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:32,750
This is my first one that I've ever made, though.

1929
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:42,700
This is like the...

1930
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:43,760
Then

1931
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:51,440
they converge.

1932
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,520
I wish I could show you what I'm doing.

1933
01:30:58,360 --> 01:30:59,560
The third hole.

1934
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:03,680
I got it!

1935
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:05,280
I got the third hole!

1936
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,100
I got the third hole.

1937
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:12,240
Take your time and you'll be fine.

1938
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:15,120
Yeah.

1939
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:22,840
Now, I'm kind of confused because...

1940
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:25,780
Wait.

1941
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:26,940
No.

1942
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:30,460
Because it doesn't look very even.

1943
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:31,840
Maybe it's supposed to look like that.

1944
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,400
Look, it kind of looks like...

1945
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:37,000
Not straight.

1946
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:39,400
But the holes are like that.

1947
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:43,240
They're like uneven, so...

1948
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:45,780
I guess this is uneven, too.

1949
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:47,200
Let me fix this guy.

1950
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:51,980
This was the third hole.

1951
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:54,480
Right there!

1952
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,780
Why does it look like that?

1953
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:57,660
I don't know.

1954
01:31:58,620 --> 01:31:59,480
I don't know.

1955
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:02,000
And then we put the sign in here.

1956
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:04,580
Like so.

1957
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:11,520
And it becomes like a little thing.

1958
01:32:15,390 --> 01:32:16,370
Oh my gosh.

1959
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:19,550
My glove is stuck on the thing and it just...

1960
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:20,210
Oh god.

1961
01:32:20,330 --> 01:32:20,610
Oh god.

1962
01:32:20,690 --> 01:32:20,910
Okay.

1963
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:21,690
We're good.

1964
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:22,050
We're good.

1965
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:22,350
We're good.

1966
01:32:22,410 --> 01:32:22,630
Okay.

1967
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:24,910
I'm gonna put it in like this.

1968
01:32:25,890 --> 01:32:26,910
I'm gonna put it in.

1969
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:28,050
Nice and gentle.

1970
01:32:28,170 --> 01:32:28,950
Nice and gentle.

1971
01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:29,790
Nice and gentle.

1972
01:32:29,890 --> 01:32:30,550
Nice and gentle.

1973
01:32:32,710 --> 01:32:33,110
Gentle.

1974
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:33,630
Gentle.

1975
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:33,850
Gentle.

1976
01:32:36,410 --> 01:32:38,090
Maybe it's a perspective thing.

1977
01:32:38,230 --> 01:32:38,970
Oh, maybe.

1978
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:39,310
Maybe.

1979
01:32:42,150 --> 01:32:42,550
Okay.

1980
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:42,950
That's...

1981
01:32:43,730 --> 01:32:44,130
Okay.

1982
01:32:44,190 --> 01:32:44,370
Hold on.

1983
01:32:44,490 --> 01:32:45,730
It didn't fit!

1984
01:32:46,030 --> 01:32:46,290
Okay.

1985
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:46,570
Hold on.

1986
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:47,210
Okay.

1987
01:32:47,330 --> 01:32:47,510
Okay.

1988
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:47,710
Okay.

1989
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:47,850
Okay.

1990
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:50,730
Is it working?

1991
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:51,670
I don't think so!

1992
01:32:53,710 --> 01:32:56,030
Might be so that it looks better once it's all together.

1993
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:56,490
Okay.

1994
01:32:56,590 --> 01:32:57,170
You're right.

1995
01:32:57,290 --> 01:32:57,570
You're right.

1996
01:32:57,630 --> 01:32:57,890
You're right.

1997
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:01,210
Easy.

1998
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:01,850
Easy.

1999
01:33:02,030 --> 01:33:02,430
Easy.

2000
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:03,430
Easy.

2001
01:33:04,190 --> 01:33:04,590
Easy.

2002
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:05,750
Easy.

2003
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:06,330
Easy now.

2004
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:06,910
Easy.

2005
01:33:07,110 --> 01:33:08,150
Oh, I'm scared.

2006
01:33:08,230 --> 01:33:08,570
I'm scared.

2007
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:08,910
I'm scared.

2008
01:33:08,910 --> 01:33:09,090
I'm scared.

2009
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:09,390
I'm scared.

2010
01:33:10,630 --> 01:33:11,070
I'm scared.

2011
01:33:11,070 --> 01:33:11,350
I'm scared.

2012
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:11,710
Okay.

2013
01:33:18,690 --> 01:33:20,330
I hope it's not because I broke it earlier.

2014
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:27,110
I'm like really trying.

2015
01:33:27,450 --> 01:33:28,570
Did you see that...

2016
01:33:29,130 --> 01:33:30,730
Did you see that squeeze?

2017
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:37,510
Maybe that's good enough.

2018
01:33:41,710 --> 01:33:42,410
There we go.

2019
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:45,790
Yippee!

2020
01:33:46,150 --> 01:33:47,830
We have like a little sign.

2021
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:48,370
We have like a little sign.

2022
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:49,050
That's so cute!

2023
01:33:51,390 --> 01:33:53,070
We have a little sign.

2024
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:54,910
See?

2025
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:56,650
Yay!

2026
01:33:58,530 --> 01:34:00,310
We did step...

2027
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:02,290
4...

2028
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:03,690
1!

2029
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:06,850
Wouldn't this be step...

2030
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,430
Why is all of this step 4?

2031
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:10,010
Wait a second.

2032
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:11,890
Oh my gosh.

2033
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:14,290
All of this is step 4?

2034
01:34:14,670 --> 01:34:16,090
This is step 5?

2035
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:19,810
This is, ah...

2036
01:34:19,810 --> 01:34:20,410
This is step 4?

2037
01:34:20,790 --> 01:34:23,030
Step 4 is two pages.

2038
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,430
Okay, we need A24.

2039
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:28,450
Wait a second.

2040
01:34:29,490 --> 01:34:30,070
A24...

2041
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,820
We need A25, A18.

2042
01:34:38,530 --> 01:34:39,400
What one was A?

2043
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:42,480
What is...

2044
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:43,160
Oh, I found A.

2045
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:45,760
A!

2046
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:49,740
See, this one is so legible, so easy to understand.

2047
01:34:57,380 --> 01:35:06,020
24... 25... 18... Got

2048
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:15,860
it.

2049
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:18,160
I want to be a gnome.

2050
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:22,560
Maybe you too can in another life be a gnome.

2051
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:28,140
There we go.

2052
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:30,040
And sand it down just a little bit.

2053
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:36,680
Draw the rest of the owl.

2054
01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:43,950
What?

2055
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:48,070
4 is the best number after all so it goes on forever.

2056
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:49,530
True.

2057
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:51,770
I can't argue with you there.

2058
01:35:55,770 --> 01:35:57,390
And then we also...

2059
01:35:58,590 --> 01:35:59,630
Thank you!

2060
01:36:02,410 --> 01:36:05,830
I think all the donuts are backed up.

2061
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:08,910
So many gifts you won't notice this donut saying MintoQ.

2062
01:36:09,070 --> 01:36:10,370
I saw it!

2063
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,580
There we go.

2064
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:32,340
Roll.

2065
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:33,300
Roll life.

2066
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:35,440
Roll roll.

2067
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:37,360
Life the power.

2068
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:40,240
Alright and then 824 and 825.

2069
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:41,960
Which are these two?

2070
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:46,460
Okay, I have to remember which...

2071
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:48,500
Okay, 24 is the dotted one.

2072
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:49,580
Everybody.

2073
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:51,440
24 is all spotted.

2074
01:36:58,960 --> 01:36:59,440
Nice.

2075
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:01,700
Nice, nice, nice.

2076
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:02,680
Okay, okay.

2077
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,200
Oh, it says 24 on it.

2078
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:05,740
Just kidding.

2079
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:08,120
Okay.

2080
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:10,000
It says 24 on it.

2081
01:37:14,230 --> 01:37:14,710
So...

2082
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:16,550
How do we do?

2083
01:37:19,650 --> 01:37:20,090
This...

2084
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:22,590
With the...

2085
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:24,590
With these little lines...

2086
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:26,650
See them?

2087
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:28,510
On the edge they go...

2088
01:37:29,130 --> 01:37:29,870
Like so.

2089
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:35,330
Yes.

2090
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:37,690
Never mind.

2091
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:39,010
I had it though.

2092
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:39,410
I had it.

2093
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:40,690
I had it.

2094
01:37:40,690 --> 01:37:41,130
I had it.

2095
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:41,570
I had it.

2096
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:44,190
I had it.

2097
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:50,130
I had it.

2098
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:50,590
I had it.

2099
01:37:50,770 --> 01:37:51,050
I had it.

2100
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:52,030
I had it.

2101
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:52,850
I had it.

2102
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:55,530
I think.

2103
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:56,930
One.

2104
01:37:57,670 --> 01:37:58,970
And the other one...

2105
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:02,190
Goes like so.

2106
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:04,050
So that 24 is on the inside.

2107
01:38:04,530 --> 01:38:06,310
What is this thing I'm creating anyway?

2108
01:38:06,910 --> 01:38:09,110
Is it like an AC maybe?

2109
01:38:11,710 --> 01:38:12,250
Two!

2110
01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:14,510
This one was so easy.

2111
01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:15,630
Oh, it's stuck on my...

2112
01:38:30,430 --> 01:38:31,710
I got it.

2113
01:38:41,030 --> 01:38:41,790
Very good.

2114
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:57,420
It's all safe in the palm of my hand.

2115
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:02,240
Now we do A22.

2116
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:07,180
And that's gonna go on the bottom here.

2117
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:12,760
A22.

2118
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:14,060
This one.

2119
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:16,640
Wait.

2120
01:39:16,780 --> 01:39:17,360
Oh gosh.

2121
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:19,760
I have to make sure I get it but not A23.

2122
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:21,260
Do I need A23?

2123
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:21,560
No.

2124
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:22,100
Oh.

2125
01:39:22,180 --> 01:39:23,980
I'll need A23 in a bit actually.

2126
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:25,120
So we can get them both.

2127
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,480
On the next page.

2128
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:31,720
Take them out together?

2129
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:32,840
The twins?

2130
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:36,800
David and Eli, I shall name you.

2131
01:39:36,980 --> 01:39:40,480
Why is this piece so thin?

2132
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:41,720
Sir Jet!

2133
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:42,920
Thanks for three months.

2134
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:43,880
Thank you.

2135
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:46,160
On lunch?

2136
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:46,660
What am I...

2137
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:47,200
What are we building?

2138
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:50,260
We're building a Sakura Densha.

2139
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:53,140
Sakura Densha.

2140
01:39:54,380 --> 01:39:55,340
Sakura Densha.

2141
01:39:55,340 --> 01:39:55,360
Sakura Densha.

2142
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:57,560
Did I just split it?

2143
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:01,080
I might have just a little bit but it's fine.

2144
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:01,800
No one will notice.

2145
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,520
The part's terrible.

2146
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:08,500
George?

2147
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:09,760
George will come later.

2148
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:13,420
Well how does it go?

2149
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:15,460
First, mommy.

2150
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:19,960
Then daddy.

2151
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:20,240
Okay.

2152
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:31,060
How does that part go?

2153
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:33,060
Okay, this is 23 everybody.

2154
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:34,620
23 right there.

2155
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:38,100
First mommy in the...

2156
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:44,940
First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes baby in the baby carriage.

2157
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:48,140
Then comes George in the George carriage.

2158
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:56,220
Okay, it's gotta be the white side facing up is what it's saying.

2159
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:58,440
And it goes like this.

2160
01:41:01,460 --> 01:41:02,020
Okay.

2161
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:07,340
Like this?

2162
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:09,460
I guess.

2163
01:41:12,860 --> 01:41:14,520
Yeah, Solidus is the baby.

2164
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:15,360
Baby brother.

2165
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:19,140
Why would the A22...

2166
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:21,700
The white side be up though?

2167
01:41:21,860 --> 01:41:23,200
Why would it be on the inside?

2168
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:30,460
Why not the part that actually says A22 on the inside?

2169
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:36,550
Curious.

2170
01:41:36,890 --> 01:41:37,370
Actually...

2171
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:43,630
Maybe it is on the inside.

2172
01:41:44,050 --> 01:41:45,230
I'm looking at the holes.

2173
01:41:45,930 --> 01:41:47,170
Maybe it is on the inside.

2174
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:47,670
Okay.

2175
01:41:47,730 --> 01:41:49,210
That would make more sense, right?

2176
01:41:51,450 --> 01:41:52,210
I'm looking at the holes.

2177
01:41:52,230 --> 01:41:53,310
I'm looking at the holes in the diagram.

2178
01:41:54,870 --> 01:41:55,430
Hmm.

2179
01:41:57,030 --> 01:42:02,330
Yeah, Solidus is the baby brother even though he became president and looks the oldest.

2180
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:06,130
He's just a baby.

2181
01:42:08,210 --> 01:42:08,770
Oh.

2182
01:42:09,510 --> 01:42:11,070
He's just a baby.

2183
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:18,710
First comes big boss, then comes big mama.

2184
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:26,340
Am I doing this wrong?

2185
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:29,200
Come on.

2186
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:30,660
Fit in.

2187
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:32,820
Why are these holes so tight?

2188
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:35,920
Oh, I think it's because...

2189
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:40,200
It's not able to go in because of the...

2190
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:42,460
It's being blocked by...

2191
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:47,500
No.

2192
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:48,940
I am doing it wrong.

2193
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:50,560
This side needs...

2194
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:51,360
This side...

2195
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:53,020
This little notch...

2196
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:54,900
Right there...

2197
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:57,020
Needs to be facing outward.

2198
01:42:57,460 --> 01:42:59,000
So I was doing it wrong.

2199
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:00,480
Okay.

2200
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:03,800
I guess the A22 does have to be on the outside.

2201
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:06,440
Facing outward.

2202
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:09,320
Because my hands are tiny?

2203
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:11,080
I don't think that has anything to do with it.

2204
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:14,300
Okay.

2205
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:14,880
Oh.

2206
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:15,780
See that fit...

2207
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:18,840
That fit so much easier.

2208
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:22,740
That fit so much more easily.

2209
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:23,860
Okay.

2210
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:26,300
Okay.

2211
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:27,260
Okay.

2212
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:29,260
Look at that.

2213
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:30,700
We got a little...

2214
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:31,760
Thing.

2215
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:36,080
Yay.

2216
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:38,440
Now we do A16.

2217
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:40,880
Which is this bad boy.

2218
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:44,300
And we...

2219
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:45,600
Um...

2220
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:49,300
Stick it in.

2221
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:52,000
We glue it in there.

2222
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:52,540
Actually.

2223
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,560
Minto has baby hands.

2224
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:59,460
You have baby brain.

2225
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:06,600
Where did this come from?

2226
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:08,580
Where did that little...

2227
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:11,240
Dingle hopper come from?

2228
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:12,880
Yeah.

2229
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:16,240
Yeah.

2230
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:17,140
Brutal.

2231
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:20,380
Don't come...

2232
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:23,660
Don't come in the kitchen unless you're ready to get...

2233
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:24,640
Burned.

2234
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:26,680
And now we stick this in here.

2235
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:28,080
Look at that.

2236
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:31,140
But what we're gonna do is we're gonna glue it.

2237
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:32,960
Oh my gosh.

2238
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:33,800
So cute.

2239
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:35,480
We gotta glue it though.

2240
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:36,220
We gotta glue it.

2241
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:40,360
We glue all of the back.

2242
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:42,540
Or all of this part.

2243
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:43,720
No.

2244
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:44,900
All of this part.

2245
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:49,720
Yeah.

2246
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:53,960
We glue all of that.

2247
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:55,900
Where's my glue?

2248
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:56,220
Here.

2249
01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:00,920
Just glue it.

2250
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:03,000
Fib!

2251
01:45:03,220 --> 01:45:04,880
Thanks for three months.

2252
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:06,800
Alright.

2253
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:08,580
Glue, glue, glue.

2254
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:11,160
We can't mess this part up you guys.

2255
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:12,780
We can't...

2256
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:14,160
We can't mess this part up.

2257
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:15,620
You just put it in there.

2258
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,360
There's no way we can mess it up.

2259
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:20,060
You just stick it on and it's easy.

2260
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:21,100
Easy peasy.

2261
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:23,560
There's no way we can mess this up.

2262
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:26,760
There's no way we can screw it up.

2263
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:29,240
There's no way we can screw it up.

2264
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:31,660
It came with the glue?

2265
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:32,080
Yeah.

2266
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:32,740
Isn't it nice?

2267
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:34,060
There we go.

2268
01:45:41,390 --> 01:45:42,990
The blue glue looks delicious.

2269
01:45:43,150 --> 01:45:44,030
It's actually white.

2270
01:45:44,050 --> 01:45:45,210
It's not blue at all.

2271
01:45:45,650 --> 01:45:47,250
I can see why it looks blue.

2272
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:52,400
Little AC unit.

2273
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:53,580
It's so cute.

2274
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:55,520
There's a little bit of glue.

2275
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:56,560
Will you sense it?

2276
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:57,720
Get it off.

2277
01:46:06,090 --> 01:46:08,130
My little tiny sensei.

2278
01:46:12,130 --> 01:46:12,690
Nice.

2279
01:46:13,690 --> 01:46:14,250
Noice.

2280
01:46:14,990 --> 01:46:16,470
Look how cute that is.

2281
01:46:16,690 --> 01:46:18,210
Look how cute that is.

2282
01:46:18,210 --> 01:46:19,810
Now we do A23.

2283
01:46:20,450 --> 01:46:21,690
Which is this piece.

2284
01:46:21,970 --> 01:46:23,450
And we glue it on...

2285
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:24,870
No, we snap it in on top.

2286
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:29,810
I guess it doesn't matter which way it goes.

2287
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:33,740
Hopefully.

2288
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:35,780
This is the nicer side.

2289
01:46:44,510 --> 01:46:45,650
Oh my gosh, please.

2290
01:46:46,290 --> 01:46:46,770
Please.

2291
01:46:47,710 --> 01:46:49,210
Actually, I hope not.

2292
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:51,050
I can't tell.

2293
01:46:52,690 --> 01:46:53,770
I can't tell.

2294
01:46:55,630 --> 01:46:56,070
No.

2295
01:46:56,390 --> 01:46:57,810
I think either side works.

2296
01:46:58,110 --> 01:46:58,390
Right?

2297
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:01,970
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

2298
01:47:02,390 --> 01:47:03,270
I got it in.

2299
01:47:04,410 --> 01:47:05,190
One side.

2300
01:47:05,290 --> 01:47:07,650
Oh my god.

2301
01:47:07,710 --> 01:47:08,550
It's a box.

2302
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:11,310
Oh my gosh, this is so exciting.

2303
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:12,690
Yeah.

2304
01:47:14,390 --> 01:47:16,270
Do a lot of these pieces need to be glued?

2305
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:17,050
I don't think so.

2306
01:47:18,990 --> 01:47:19,950
I don't think so.

2307
01:47:21,190 --> 01:47:23,070
It will tell you when to glue stuff.

2308
01:47:24,330 --> 01:47:24,770
It will tell you when to glue stuff.

2309
01:47:24,790 --> 01:47:26,710
Wait, this one has spare parts.

2310
01:47:27,110 --> 01:47:29,750
Wait, why didn't B18 have spare parts?

2311
01:47:29,810 --> 01:47:33,650
But these A11 and A9 have spare parts.

2312
01:47:33,730 --> 01:47:36,770
Why doesn't B18 have a spare part?

2313
01:47:37,190 --> 01:47:37,830
Why doesn't B18 have a spare part?

2314
01:47:37,830 --> 01:47:39,250
Oh, these ones are really...

2315
01:47:39,250 --> 01:47:39,550
Oh gosh.

2316
01:47:39,770 --> 01:47:40,850
This is what we're...

2317
01:47:40,850 --> 01:47:43,430
This part is what we're taking out.

2318
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:49,090
11 and 9.

2319
01:47:49,230 --> 01:47:49,810
11 and 9.

2320
01:47:54,790 --> 01:47:55,190
Have you heard that?

2321
01:47:55,270 --> 01:47:56,710
Like the whole piece cracked.

2322
01:47:57,870 --> 01:47:59,250
Oh my god, oh my god.

2323
01:47:59,570 --> 01:48:01,750
Everything is cracking but the thing that I need to come out.

2324
01:48:01,930 --> 01:48:02,650
Okay, we got 11.

2325
01:48:05,330 --> 01:48:06,550
Successfully extracted 11.

2326
01:48:08,290 --> 01:48:09,430
I should be a surgeon.

2327
01:48:10,130 --> 01:48:12,750
You would put your lives in my hands, right?

2328
01:48:13,890 --> 01:48:14,950
Look how well I'm doing.

2329
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:16,590
I only broke one bone.

2330
01:48:17,570 --> 01:48:18,570
Yes, I got 9.

2331
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:29,880
Let's get rid of some of these.

2332
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:32,640
I would not.

2333
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:33,680
Why not?

2334
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:37,260
Be honest with me.

2335
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:39,640
Why wouldn't you...

2336
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:40,500
Why?

2337
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:42,520
Why?

2338
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:44,660
Um...

2339
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:46,120
Why?

2340
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:51,220
Why are you not trusting your life in Mito's hands?

2341
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:51,940
Huh?

2342
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:54,240
I'm gonna take this to your throat.

2343
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:03,540
This is your throat I'm cutting through.

2344
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:07,900
You don't need that.

2345
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:10,780
You don't need that.

2346
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:12,680
You're done talking.

2347
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:14,160
You're done talking.

2348
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:19,120
No, I needed that.

2349
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:21,940
Think about when Mito is cute.

2350
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:22,800
Which is always.

2351
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:33,960
Which one was 9 and which one was 11?

2352
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:36,660
Oh well.

2353
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:38,760
Maybe it doesn't matter.

2354
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:43,240
Oh, I can tell.

2355
01:49:44,860 --> 01:49:46,320
11 is long.

2356
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:49,680
No, 9 is long.

2357
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:52,600
11 is a little baby short.

2358
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:56,760
How does this work?

2359
01:49:57,880 --> 01:49:59,420
Why are they sticking up in there?

2360
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,380
So you take it and you go...

2361
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:09,740
I'm afraid this won't fit.

2362
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:12,340
I'm afraid this won't fit.

2363
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:12,880
I'm afraid it won't fit.

2364
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:14,340
I'm afraid it won't fit.

2365
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:14,900
And then...

2366
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:16,460
Sorry, I might have to do this one out.

2367
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:20,520
The open part...

2368
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:20,660
The open part...

2369
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,760
Is facing the back.

2370
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:25,700
Is facing...

2371
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:27,560
The back.

2372
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:29,700
Okay.

2373
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:33,500
Nice.

2374
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:34,340
Oh, it does fit.

2375
01:50:34,340 --> 01:50:34,780
It does fit.

2376
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,520
Would you look at that?

2377
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:43,000
It fit in so easily.

2378
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:45,180
And then 11...

2379
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:46,960
Goes in as well.

2380
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:50,600
Gloves.

2381
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:56,340
Gloves, gloves, gloves.

2382
01:51:04,580 --> 01:51:06,060
Oh my gosh.

2383
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,640
Okay, 11 is a little more tricky.

2384
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,660
Probably because he's short but stout.

2385
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:13,100
There we go.

2386
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:13,440
Okay.

2387
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:15,340
We got it.

2388
01:51:15,580 --> 01:51:16,440
Why do I...

2389
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:17,040
Why though?

2390
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:18,480
Why is this piece longer?

2391
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:20,920
I can't tell why.

2392
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:24,920
But we got it.

2393
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:27,100
Our little AC unit.

2394
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:28,060
So cute.

2395
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:31,000
Oh, okay.

2396
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:32,060
E25.

2397
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:33,480
There's more to this?

2398
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:36,060
Why is this piece so intricate?

2399
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:38,840
E25.

2400
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:39,380
E25.

2401
01:51:39,380 --> 01:51:39,820
What was E?

2402
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:42,460
E.

2403
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:43,140
E.

2404
01:51:43,660 --> 01:51:44,420
E?

2405
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:46,240
E.

2406
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:48,080
This is B.

2407
01:51:50,220 --> 01:51:51,260
This is...

2408
01:51:51,260 --> 01:51:52,380
I.

2409
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:55,780
This is...

2410
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:57,120
A.

2411
01:51:57,660 --> 01:51:59,360
Oh my gosh.

2412
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:01,680
This whole piece just came out of my hands.

2413
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:03,620
This is F.

2414
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:06,260
This is...

2415
01:52:09,190 --> 01:52:09,590
A.

2416
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:10,590
G.

2417
01:52:11,970 --> 01:52:12,570
C.

2418
01:52:14,810 --> 01:52:15,410
D.

2419
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:18,130
E.

2420
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:24,160
I got it.

2421
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:26,100
I got it.

2422
01:52:28,580 --> 01:52:31,340
How many of you guys have put one of these together before?

2423
01:52:34,610 --> 01:52:35,210
Two.

2424
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:35,950
Two.

2425
01:52:36,650 --> 01:52:37,550
Thank you.

2426
01:52:39,550 --> 01:52:40,930
Thanks Kid Party.

2427
01:52:40,930 --> 01:52:41,250
E.

2428
01:52:41,490 --> 01:52:43,410
I admire your out-of-the-box thinking.

2429
01:52:43,530 --> 01:52:49,670
Housing prices are higher than ever and here you are building your own size house to live...

2430
01:52:49,670 --> 01:52:50,050
No, no.

2431
01:52:50,090 --> 01:52:51,230
It's for the gnomes.

2432
01:52:51,410 --> 01:52:52,450
What are you talking about?

2433
01:52:52,590 --> 01:52:53,130
It's not for me.

2434
01:52:54,150 --> 01:52:58,790
But I am trying to help out a poor gnome in a housing crisis.

2435
01:52:58,910 --> 01:52:59,270
Yes.

2436
01:53:02,550 --> 01:53:02,990
E25.

2437
01:53:04,090 --> 01:53:04,530
E25.

2438
01:53:04,610 --> 01:53:05,310
Oh my gosh.

2439
01:53:05,310 --> 01:53:06,310
There's so much on here.

2440
01:53:06,790 --> 01:53:08,550
Where would 25 even be?

2441
01:53:10,170 --> 01:53:14,470
If I were an E25, I'd be right here.

2442
01:53:15,790 --> 01:53:16,550
I found it.

2443
01:53:18,030 --> 01:53:21,330
I want to build this one and the forest one I saw.

2444
01:53:22,910 --> 01:53:25,030
Are you sure it's not just for the snake figure?

2445
01:53:25,890 --> 01:53:26,670
I'll be honest.

2446
01:53:26,730 --> 01:53:27,910
I didn't even consider that.

2447
01:53:27,970 --> 01:53:30,110
And now it's 100% for snake.

2448
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:35,350
I didn't even consider this being for snake.

2449
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:37,330
Oh, do you guys want to see him?

2450
01:53:37,530 --> 01:53:38,270
Wait, where is he?

2451
01:53:39,490 --> 01:53:40,570
He might be...

2452
01:53:42,390 --> 01:53:42,790
Elsewhere.

2453
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:44,490
He might be out on a mission right now.

2454
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:45,530
He might be on...

2455
01:53:45,530 --> 01:53:47,970
I was going to say he might be on a philanthropy mission.

2456
01:53:48,110 --> 01:53:48,810
But it's naked snake.

2457
01:53:51,330 --> 01:53:52,050
Where is he?

2458
01:53:55,430 --> 01:53:55,830
Snake?

2459
01:54:04,710 --> 01:54:05,830
Yeah, he's in his egg.

2460
01:54:05,930 --> 01:54:06,170
Yes.

2461
01:54:06,990 --> 01:54:07,490
Hold on.

2462
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:29,260
I think he's in my purse.

2463
01:54:30,940 --> 01:54:32,160
I think he's in my purse.

2464
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:36,760
So that he can never leave.

2465
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:38,320
Okay.

2466
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:38,960
How does this go?

2467
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:43,120
It goes like this.

2468
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:44,700
Oh, it fits in right there.

2469
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:45,620
Oh, see.

2470
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:47,380
I don't know if you guys can see it.

2471
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:48,240
See that outline?

2472
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:50,920
The little boxy outline in the top left corner?

2473
01:54:51,640 --> 01:54:53,020
That's where this goes into.

2474
01:54:53,260 --> 01:54:54,040
Wait, do I have to glue it?

2475
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:54,720
Oh, I do.

2476
01:54:55,660 --> 01:54:56,680
I have to glue it.

2477
01:55:00,630 --> 01:55:00,990
Okay.

2478
01:55:02,550 --> 01:55:03,730
I glue it.

2479
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:04,090
I glue.

2480
01:55:05,170 --> 01:55:06,450
Why though?

2481
01:55:08,270 --> 01:55:10,310
Konami needs to announce the release date.

2482
01:55:10,490 --> 01:55:14,730
He won't be released until we get the game.

2483
01:55:19,890 --> 01:55:20,530
He won't be released until we get the game.

2484
01:55:21,090 --> 01:55:21,730
Nice.

2485
01:55:25,710 --> 01:55:27,650
Please stand up straight.

2486
01:55:28,890 --> 01:55:29,790
Okay, whatever.

2487
01:55:31,630 --> 01:55:33,110
This goes in here.

2488
01:55:33,230 --> 01:55:33,870
This goes in here.

2489
01:55:34,090 --> 01:55:36,090
And then I think we put E51.

2490
01:55:37,570 --> 01:55:38,090
Okay.

2491
01:55:38,130 --> 01:55:38,950
Just like that.

2492
01:55:39,450 --> 01:55:40,930
This is so intricate.

2493
01:55:41,190 --> 01:55:41,430
Why?

2494
01:55:41,910 --> 01:55:45,570
Why am I building the inside of this AC unit?

2495
01:55:45,730 --> 01:55:46,710
Nobody will see it.

2496
01:55:47,090 --> 01:55:47,750
Will they?

2497
01:55:48,190 --> 01:55:50,390
I'm literally about to put the back on.

2498
01:55:51,090 --> 01:55:51,810
I think.

2499
01:55:56,680 --> 01:55:57,200
E51.

2500
01:55:58,100 --> 01:55:58,980
This is A.

2501
01:55:59,120 --> 01:55:59,540
E.

2502
01:56:02,020 --> 01:56:03,320
For your satisfaction.

2503
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:06,200
It has to be a functioning unit.

2504
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:07,940
Or whatever.

2505
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:08,740
What is the point?

2506
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:10,820
E51 is right here.

2507
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:14,280
Oh gosh.

2508
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:16,900
Oh gosh.

2509
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:20,660
I got it.

2510
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:21,660
Okay.

2511
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:24,680
Nice desk mat.

2512
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:25,420
Thank you.

2513
01:56:27,940 --> 01:56:30,200
We still have our sign right here.

2514
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:40,940
I'm gonna shave down these burrs.

2515
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:43,160
Get them burrs.

2516
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:46,780
Get them burrs.

2517
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:50,920
Get them burrs.

2518
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:52,060
Get them burrs.

2519
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:53,160
Get them burrs.

2520
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:53,560
Get them burrs.

2521
01:56:53,600 --> 01:56:54,740
This model was fun to build.

2522
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:55,420
Good luck, Minto.

2523
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:55,980
Thank you.

2524
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,020
If I don't finish it.

2525
01:57:00,580 --> 01:57:01,220
That's okay.

2526
01:57:01,220 --> 01:57:02,520
I will...

2527
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:05,200
I put it like this.

2528
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:06,420
That's fine.

2529
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,900
I put it like halfway finished.

2530
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:09,900
Or halfway open.

2531
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:11,560
That makes even...

2532
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:11,980
Okay.

2533
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:17,720
Just slip that in there.

2534
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:18,700
I guess.

2535
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,680
I wish I could use this side instead.

2536
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:24,120
It's cleaner than this side.

2537
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:27,120
This side has a little hole in it.

2538
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:29,360
Oh well.

2539
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:32,800
Oh.

2540
01:57:32,900 --> 01:57:34,520
I think

2541
01:57:37,910 --> 01:57:38,610
I got it.

2542
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:41,470
There we go.

2543
01:57:41,570 --> 01:57:42,210
Did you hear that snap?

2544
01:57:42,310 --> 01:57:42,750
Oh my gosh.

2545
01:57:42,750 --> 01:57:43,770
I'm like a chiropractor.

2546
01:57:44,690 --> 01:57:45,210
Yippee!

2547
01:57:45,630 --> 01:57:46,150
Sorry.

2548
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:46,770
Yippee!

2549
01:57:50,750 --> 01:57:52,190
I don't understand.

2550
01:57:53,450 --> 01:57:55,310
That was all step four.

2551
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:03,280
Now we have a sign and an air con.

2552
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:07,200
Next is step four.

2553
01:58:07,220 --> 01:58:07,840
Step five!

2554
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:10,740
You guys, step five looks really exciting.

2555
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:12,060
It's a lot of gluing.

2556
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:14,160
But it's...

2557
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:16,100
We're getting into the trees.

2558
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:18,540
I speak for the trees.

2559
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:20,680
So we need F and C.

2560
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:24,560
I know which one C is.

2561
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:26,540
Which one is F?

2562
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:29,120
Oh I found F.

2563
01:58:30,340 --> 01:58:30,820
Okay.

2564
01:58:30,860 --> 01:58:32,340
I need F12.

2565
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:34,400
Alex!

2566
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:36,800
Thanks for the 10.

2567
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:37,680
Thank you!

2568
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:39,740
Thanks for the donut.

2569
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:42,600
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2570
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:44,620
F12, I think?

2571
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:46,080
I need this.

2572
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:46,640
Look, look, look.

2573
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:48,980
We're getting into some colors, everybody.

2574
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:50,580
F12.

2575
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:51,240
Oh gosh.

2576
01:58:51,420 --> 01:58:51,860
Wait.

2577
01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:56,320
Okay.

2578
01:58:56,660 --> 01:58:57,340
Easy now.

2579
01:58:57,440 --> 01:58:57,880
Easy.

2580
01:58:58,260 --> 01:58:59,060
Easy peasy.

2581
01:58:59,140 --> 01:59:00,540
Easy breezy.

2582
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:00,940
Beautiful.

2583
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:02,380
Cover girl?

2584
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:03,640
Cover girl, cover girl.

2585
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:06,160
Cover girl, cover girl, cover girl.

2586
01:59:06,700 --> 01:59:07,420
Come on, come on.

2587
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:10,060
Come on, come on, come on.

2588
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:12,460
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

2589
01:59:13,060 --> 01:59:13,600
This part?

2590
01:59:13,700 --> 01:59:14,180
This part's out.

2591
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:14,920
This part's out.

2592
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:16,660
This part's out.

2593
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:20,840
Okay.

2594
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:22,780
We did it.

2595
01:59:23,420 --> 01:59:25,220
Okay, we did it.

2596
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:28,420
And this part goes with F.

2597
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:30,080
And C.

2598
01:59:32,460 --> 01:59:33,340
Oh my gosh.

2599
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:35,740
I just noticed C19.

2600
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:38,220
And C20.

2601
01:59:38,580 --> 01:59:39,620
And C21.

2602
01:59:39,740 --> 01:59:40,980
Look at all those tiny little...

2603
01:59:42,220 --> 01:59:42,740
And C20.

2604
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:43,740
And C21.

2605
01:59:43,740 --> 01:59:43,740
Look at all those tiny little...

2606
01:59:43,740 --> 01:59:44,940
All the individual...

2607
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:47,660
All the individual...

2608
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:47,680
All the...

2609
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:49,280
I think they go on this.

2610
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:52,100
So you can kind of see an outline of a...

2611
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:56,300
I think we'll be pasting them on that.

2612
01:59:56,840 --> 01:59:57,740
Gluing them there.

2613
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:00,920
C13.

2614
02:00:00,940 --> 02:00:01,340
C32.

2615
02:00:02,120 --> 02:00:02,920
This one.

2616
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:05,780
Okay.

2617
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:07,940
This is much thinner.

2618
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:11,060
So it makes me even more nervous.

2619
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:11,440
Okay.

2620
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,900
Okay, okay.

2621
02:00:14,940 --> 02:00:15,380
Nice, nice.

2622
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:18,580
Just push down nice and easy.

2623
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:20,160
Nice and easy.

2624
02:00:22,020 --> 02:00:22,640
Easy.

2625
02:00:22,940 --> 02:00:23,560
Gaming.

2626
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:24,340
We're gaming.

2627
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:24,980
We're gaming.

2628
02:00:24,980 --> 02:00:25,060
We're gaming.

2629
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:28,360
We're gaming.

2630
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:28,520
Hey!

2631
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:31,440
Oh my gosh.

2632
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:34,380
I can't wait because this is going to add so much like depth, you know?

2633
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:38,400
It's going to add so much depth to our little landscape.

2634
02:00:39,580 --> 02:00:40,220
It's going to add so much depth to our little landscape.

2635
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:40,800
It's going to add so much depth to our little landscape.

2636
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:41,280
Alright.

2637
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:41,820
So.

2638
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:43,520
C32.

2639
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:45,460
Hey, excuse me.

2640
02:00:45,540 --> 02:00:46,220
Your time is over.

2641
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:48,000
Goes like...

2642
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:50,460
This.

2643
02:00:52,180 --> 02:00:53,060
And then...

2644
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:56,420
F12 goes like this.

2645
02:00:56,780 --> 02:00:57,920
And then they...

2646
02:00:58,780 --> 02:00:59,080
Wow!

2647
02:00:59,860 --> 02:01:00,860
They line up!

2648
02:01:01,620 --> 02:01:02,920
Oh my god.

2649
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:05,120
They line up!

2650
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:06,400
That's so exciting.

2651
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:08,680
This is so exciting.

2652
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:12,900
This is the most excitement I might have had in a long time.

2653
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:17,000
It's not perfect.

2654
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:17,820
There we go.

2655
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:19,060
That's more perfect.

2656
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:21,780
Do I glue it?

2657
02:01:23,540 --> 02:01:25,120
I think I glue it.

2658
02:01:27,740 --> 02:01:29,520
I think I glue it.

2659
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:30,160
I think I glue them together.

2660
02:01:40,030 --> 02:01:41,170
La la la.

2661
02:01:42,010 --> 02:01:43,450
La la la la la.

2662
02:01:44,310 --> 02:01:45,690
When gnome reveal?

2663
02:01:46,030 --> 02:01:49,950
My gnomes are very private gnomes so...

2664
02:01:49,950 --> 02:01:50,610
Sorry.

2665
02:01:50,830 --> 02:01:53,230
You may never ever see one.

2666
02:01:54,930 --> 02:01:59,090
But if I'm late for stream usually that's because they've like messed up my setup.

2667
02:01:59,650 --> 02:02:04,150
You know, I'm trying to appease them so that I can be a better content creator.

2668
02:02:04,950 --> 02:02:07,150
And less late for stream.

2669
02:02:07,550 --> 02:02:10,370
You know, they're just sassy little guys.

2670
02:02:13,410 --> 02:02:14,870
So you're crying.

2671
02:02:14,950 --> 02:02:15,830
You're like, Minto's late.

2672
02:02:16,250 --> 02:02:17,290
It's not my fault.

2673
02:02:17,670 --> 02:02:18,830
Blame the gnomes.

2674
02:02:20,230 --> 02:02:21,610
Blame the gnomes.

2675
02:02:23,090 --> 02:02:24,490
Oh gosh, oh gosh.

2676
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:29,980
I think this is even.

2677
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:33,120
This looks even.

2678
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:34,600
This looks...

2679
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:36,900
Sensei!

2680
02:02:36,900 --> 02:02:38,020
They are innocent.

2681
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:40,040
You don't even know them!

2682
02:02:40,780 --> 02:02:42,320
The gnomes hate us.

2683
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:45,780
They hate everybody though.

2684
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:49,060
So I'm hoping with this, they'll love it.

2685
02:02:49,140 --> 02:02:52,460
They'll be like our little beautiful Sakura dream house.

2686
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:56,860
I'm getting the glue out of the corners right now.

2687
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:01,900
Nice.

2688
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:06,080
The gnomes get a pass but I don't?

2689
02:03:08,060 --> 02:03:08,480
What?

2690
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:10,560
Why do the gnomes get a pass?

2691
02:03:13,300 --> 02:03:16,840
But you know, before you even knew of the gnomes, you were just like...

2692
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:17,560
Minto!

2693
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:21,540
But why do the gnomes get a pass but Minto doesn't get a pass?

2694
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:24,920
Messed up.

2695
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:27,880
Alright, now we need C24.

2696
02:03:32,700 --> 02:03:33,120
And...

2697
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:36,260
C22.

2698
02:03:41,640 --> 02:03:43,500
Oh, this one's a little complicated.

2699
02:03:43,780 --> 02:03:44,020
Okay.

2700
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:46,260
C24.

2701
02:03:46,460 --> 02:03:47,020
This.

2702
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:49,920
Get the corners.

2703
02:03:50,220 --> 02:03:50,980
Get the corners.

2704
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:52,440
Get the corners.

2705
02:03:53,860 --> 02:03:54,420
C24.

2706
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:59,320
So now we're like kind of offsetting it when we glue it.

2707
02:03:59,380 --> 02:03:59,840
Interesting.

2708
02:04:00,020 --> 02:04:00,360
Okay.

2709
02:04:01,540 --> 02:04:02,300
There we go.

2710
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:04,440
C3.

2711
02:04:06,440 --> 02:04:08,200
That looks good.

2712
02:04:08,280 --> 02:04:10,120
C24 and C22.

2713
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:11,080
This one.

2714
02:04:13,300 --> 02:04:14,020
Gnomes are cool.

2715
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:15,800
They're just little guys.

2716
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:18,540
I'm just... I'm little ghost!

2717
02:04:20,100 --> 02:04:20,480
I'm

2718
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:25,060
little ghost!

2719
02:04:27,900 --> 02:04:30,280
I'm just... I'm just doing my best...

2720
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:32,860
For you, Gosho-Din-sama and Josama...

2721
02:04:32,860 --> 02:04:38,200
To... to... to serve you and to entertain you and to...

2722
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:40,140
You know, haunt you.

2723
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:44,440
Gomaesama!

2724
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:46,420
Thank you for the finds.

2725
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:47,420
Gifted to you.

2726
02:04:47,820 --> 02:04:48,420
Thank you.

2727
02:04:56,100 --> 02:04:58,000
I think I could use a pass too.

2728
02:04:58,880 --> 02:04:59,360
That's all.

2729
02:05:04,940 --> 02:05:05,420
That's all.

2730
02:05:14,510 --> 02:05:16,510
Need to be fair with NyanNyan maid level.

2731
02:05:16,570 --> 02:05:17,450
I will never be her.

2732
02:05:19,810 --> 02:05:21,950
Why not a second one for a little ghost?

2733
02:05:23,330 --> 02:05:24,150
Oh my god.

2734
02:05:24,150 --> 02:05:24,850
Oh!

2735
02:05:26,450 --> 02:05:27,570
You guys?

2736
02:05:27,770 --> 02:05:28,630
Oh my god!

2737
02:05:29,570 --> 02:05:31,790
You guys, I just broke my chair!

2738
02:05:32,910 --> 02:05:33,850
Oh my god!

2739
02:05:34,890 --> 02:05:37,690
I just broke my chair and I don't know how.

2740
02:05:37,950 --> 02:05:38,510
Wait.

2741
02:05:40,450 --> 02:05:41,010
Wait.

2742
02:05:43,990 --> 02:05:46,110
I just broke my chair.

2743
02:05:48,370 --> 02:05:49,690
This isn't my chair.

2744
02:05:50,150 --> 02:05:51,570
Oh god, it's really dusty.

2745
02:05:51,570 --> 02:05:51,910
Ew.

2746
02:05:52,270 --> 02:05:54,110
I just broke my chair.

2747
02:06:05,640 --> 02:06:07,640
I wasn't even touching it.

2748
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:10,000
The gnomes did it.

2749
02:06:10,240 --> 02:06:11,900
The gnomes.

2750
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:20,040
Chair funds.

2751
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:21,040
Thank you.

2752
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:27,180
What do I do?

2753
02:06:28,060 --> 02:06:30,100
I'll be your chair instead.

2754
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:31,180
Ew.

2755
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:32,980
Chair funds.

2756
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:33,360
Stop!

2757
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:34,980
But thank you.

2758
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:36,300
Thank you for the chair funds.

2759
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:36,940
No, no, no.

2760
02:06:37,020 --> 02:06:37,660
No, no, no, no.

2761
02:06:37,880 --> 02:06:38,520
Um.

2762
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:39,220
Um.

2763
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:39,920
Um.

2764
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:40,340
Um.

2765
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:47,700
Anyway, let's just continue onwards.

2766
02:06:48,180 --> 02:06:48,740
Okay.

2767
02:06:48,820 --> 02:06:50,780
So, we're taking C24.

2768
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:51,560
Shoot.

2769
02:06:51,660 --> 02:06:52,480
Which one was 24?

2770
02:06:52,780 --> 02:06:53,620
Is it this one?

2771
02:06:55,540 --> 02:06:56,100
No.

2772
02:06:56,600 --> 02:06:57,660
Maybe this one?

2773
02:07:01,220 --> 02:07:02,240
This looks correct.

2774
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:06,720
I think.

2775
02:07:08,380 --> 02:07:09,180
Like that?

2776
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:15,600
And then, C22 goes...

2777
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:16,320
Okay.

2778
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:17,180
Under.

2779
02:07:18,640 --> 02:07:20,100
How does this work?

2780
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:22,600
Huh?

2781
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:27,660
Wait.

2782
02:07:27,860 --> 02:07:28,080
Huh?

2783
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:31,820
Butt cradle funds.

2784
02:07:32,020 --> 02:07:32,380
Stop!

2785
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:33,340
Chair funds.

2786
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:34,200
Stop!

2787
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:35,600
Stop!

2788
02:07:35,900 --> 02:07:36,080
Stop!

2789
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:36,280
Stop!

2790
02:07:36,360 --> 02:07:37,600
Snake dumpy funds.

2791
02:07:37,740 --> 02:07:39,900
I can't believe I just broke my chair.

2792
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:41,100
Oh my gosh.

2793
02:07:41,120 --> 02:07:42,500
I can't put my feet down.

2794
02:07:42,820 --> 02:07:43,640
Oh gosh.

2795
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:46,620
Hold on.

2796
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:48,440
Can you help me?

2797
02:07:48,460 --> 02:07:48,760
Can you guys hear that?

2798
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:50,660
Hold on.

2799
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:56,040
I'm trying to...

2800
02:07:56,840 --> 02:07:58,200
I'm trying to fix it.

2801
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:01,280
How did she break her chair?

2802
02:08:01,420 --> 02:08:02,200
I don't even know!

2803
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:05,680
Okay.

2804
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:19,680
I can't fix it.

2805
02:08:20,700 --> 02:08:21,220
Oh!

2806
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:25,600
It might have been a gnome attack.

2807
02:08:26,620 --> 02:08:27,660
Oh, man.

2808
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:31,560
It's just a foot rest.

2809
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:31,920
But it's not a gnome attack.

2810
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:37,480
But now, the part where the foot rest went is a dangling metal thing.

2811
02:08:37,780 --> 02:08:41,320
And if I put my legs down, I kick it.

2812
02:08:41,580 --> 02:08:43,120
F chair could...

2813
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:45,460
I'm saluting.

2814
02:08:47,700 --> 02:08:48,900
I'm saluting.

2815
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:51,760
Chair!

2816
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:54,160
Oh, man.

2817
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:57,560
Anyway.

2818
02:08:58,700 --> 02:08:59,340
Okay.

2819
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:01,900
I have to figure out which one is C-24 and which one is C-25.

2820
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:04,880
Because I can't tell.

2821
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:09,440
This is...

2822
02:09:10,140 --> 02:09:10,680
Wait.

2823
02:09:10,720 --> 02:09:11,400
They both look the...

2824
02:09:12,120 --> 02:09:13,020
Oh, they're the...

2825
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:13,940
Are they the same?

2826
02:09:14,140 --> 02:09:14,440
No.

2827
02:09:14,700 --> 02:09:15,400
Uh-oh.

2828
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:16,820
They both look really similar.

2829
02:09:17,640 --> 02:09:18,420
Oh, gosh.

2830
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:21,200
I think this one is...

2831
02:09:24,450 --> 02:09:26,190
This one is C-24.

2832
02:09:32,710 --> 02:09:35,270
This one is C-24 and goes like this.

2833
02:09:35,430 --> 02:09:35,890
I don't know.

2834
02:09:36,450 --> 02:09:37,470
So I'm gonna glue it.

2835
02:09:40,270 --> 02:09:42,050
Check underneath, see if there's any bolts.

2836
02:09:42,250 --> 02:09:42,870
Shook loose.

2837
02:09:44,910 --> 02:09:45,530
I'm looking.

2838
02:09:46,250 --> 02:09:47,190
Oh, my God.

2839
02:09:47,210 --> 02:09:49,090
I almost just pulled off my entire interface.

2840
02:09:56,230 --> 02:09:57,490
I don't see anything.

2841
02:09:57,670 --> 02:09:58,630
I don't know what happened.

2842
02:09:58,790 --> 02:10:00,230
I seriously don't know what happened.

2843
02:10:02,170 --> 02:10:02,770
Uh-oh.

2844
02:10:03,190 --> 02:10:03,770
Uh-oh.

2845
02:10:03,770 --> 02:10:04,070
Wait.

2846
02:10:04,150 --> 02:10:04,290
Wait.

2847
02:10:04,390 --> 02:10:04,470
Wait.

2848
02:10:04,470 --> 02:10:04,590
Wait.

2849
02:10:04,590 --> 02:10:04,670
Wait.

2850
02:10:04,710 --> 02:10:05,450
Uh-oh.

2851
02:10:05,470 --> 02:10:05,950
Uh-oh.

2852
02:10:05,950 --> 02:10:06,370
Uh-oh.

2853
02:10:06,370 --> 02:10:06,830
Uh-oh.

2854
02:10:06,830 --> 02:10:07,330
Uh-oh.

2855
02:10:07,490 --> 02:10:09,710
You guys, I think my chair is coming undone.

2856
02:10:10,290 --> 02:10:10,710
I can't see anything.

2857
02:10:10,710 --> 02:10:11,470
I can't turn it.

2858
02:10:11,570 --> 02:10:11,850
Uh-oh.

2859
02:10:11,930 --> 02:10:12,430
Uh-oh.

2860
02:10:12,610 --> 02:10:14,290
You guys, I might have to end...

2861
02:10:14,290 --> 02:10:21,090
If I turn my chair, it makes this horrible grating.

2862
02:10:21,310 --> 02:10:21,810
Uh-oh.

2863
02:10:22,390 --> 02:10:22,950
Uh-oh.

2864
02:10:22,950 --> 02:10:23,670
I can't turn my...

2865
02:10:23,670 --> 02:10:23,990
Uh-oh.

2866
02:10:24,010 --> 02:10:24,590
Uh-oh.

2867
02:10:25,790 --> 02:10:28,270
You guys, I think I lost my chair tonight.

2868
02:10:30,110 --> 02:10:32,680
No way.

2869
02:10:32,980 --> 02:10:33,800
My chair.

2870
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:35,400
My chair.

2871
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:37,920
I'm gonna glue this real quick.

2872
02:10:40,660 --> 02:10:41,520
How does it go?

2873
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:42,020
Let's see.

2874
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:42,440
Oh, my God.

2875
02:10:43,460 --> 02:10:43,980
Like...

2876
02:10:44,820 --> 02:10:45,340
No.

2877
02:10:45,580 --> 02:10:46,680
It can't go like so.

2878
02:10:51,660 --> 02:10:52,840
Maybe this is it.

2879
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:56,200
No.

2880
02:10:58,080 --> 02:10:58,900
I'm confused.

2881
02:11:01,740 --> 02:11:02,500
Oh, my gosh.

2882
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:04,340
I can't turn my chair back and forth.

2883
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:05,100
It's actually...

2884
02:11:05,100 --> 02:11:06,260
What's wrong with it?

2885
02:11:06,340 --> 02:11:07,000
What happened?

2886
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:09,800
Chair could...

2887
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:11,520
What happened to my chair?

2888
02:11:12,020 --> 02:11:13,520
Oh, it's like this, I think.

2889
02:11:14,420 --> 02:11:14,940
Okay.

2890
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:33,720
I feel like I'm doing, like, a weird puzzle.

2891
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:41,820
Like so?

2892
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:42,360
No.

2893
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:44,020
That's too far off, I think.

2894
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:45,760
I can't tell.

2895
02:11:45,880 --> 02:11:47,040
This part is really confusing.

2896
02:11:47,740 --> 02:11:49,460
This part is really confusing.

2897
02:11:54,830 --> 02:11:55,350
Okay.

2898
02:11:55,390 --> 02:11:55,970
It's like this.

2899
02:11:56,210 --> 02:11:57,430
That's why it was so confusing.

2900
02:11:58,170 --> 02:12:00,410
But also, it doesn't line up.

2901
02:12:02,390 --> 02:12:02,910
The...

2902
02:12:02,910 --> 02:12:03,370
The...

2903
02:12:03,370 --> 02:12:04,830
The petals don't line up.

2904
02:12:05,310 --> 02:12:05,830
Okay.

2905
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:09,020
Okay.

2906
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:10,100
Do they line up here?

2907
02:12:16,140 --> 02:12:16,460
No.

2908
02:12:20,140 --> 02:12:21,980
First my chair, now my brain!

2909
02:12:25,060 --> 02:12:26,740
Turn it into a chair-fixing stream.

2910
02:12:32,510 --> 02:12:33,150
Why, chair?

2911
02:12:35,390 --> 02:12:35,710
Oh!

2912
02:12:35,810 --> 02:12:36,490
I fixed it!

2913
02:12:36,570 --> 02:12:36,950
I found it!

2914
02:12:36,970 --> 02:12:37,110
Okay.

2915
02:12:37,230 --> 02:12:37,550
Okay.

2916
02:12:37,570 --> 02:12:37,910
I got it.

2917
02:12:37,950 --> 02:12:38,270
I got it.

2918
02:12:38,290 --> 02:12:38,630
I got it.

2919
02:12:38,830 --> 02:12:39,470
I got it.

2920
02:12:39,470 --> 02:12:39,890
I got it.

2921
02:12:39,890 --> 02:12:40,430
Not my chair.

2922
02:12:40,530 --> 02:12:41,190
I didn't fix my chair.

2923
02:12:42,730 --> 02:12:43,730
I fixed this.

2924
02:12:44,330 --> 02:12:44,910
Okay, hold on.

2925
02:12:46,110 --> 02:12:48,050
Let's just glue it on while I have it.

2926
02:12:48,510 --> 02:12:50,250
Let's glue it on while I have it.

2927
02:13:06,750 --> 02:13:07,150
So...

2928
02:13:10,610 --> 02:13:11,230
Oh, wait.

2929
02:13:11,330 --> 02:13:12,310
Move it down a little.

2930
02:13:12,390 --> 02:13:12,790
There we go.

2931
02:13:14,710 --> 02:13:15,430
Like so.

2932
02:13:16,430 --> 02:13:17,230
Like so.

2933
02:13:18,070 --> 02:13:18,770
There we go.

2934
02:13:18,830 --> 02:13:19,450
I think that's good.

2935
02:13:20,150 --> 02:13:21,130
Super glue the chair!

2936
02:13:21,250 --> 02:13:22,130
Super glue everything!

2937
02:13:24,170 --> 02:13:25,630
How big the forehead...

2938
02:13:25,630 --> 02:13:26,330
What are you talking about?

2939
02:13:27,750 --> 02:13:28,550
My forehead's so big.

2940
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:29,430
It's just a little big, okay?

2941
02:13:35,430 --> 02:13:38,170
Wires for the lights I got were too short and couldn't reach all the lights?

2942
02:13:38,270 --> 02:13:38,790
No way!

2943
02:13:39,870 --> 02:13:40,710
No way, really?

2944
02:13:41,910 --> 02:13:43,290
Hopefully, that doesn't happen with me.

2945
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:50,610
Oh, there's like a lot of glue on the other side because I'm an idiot.

2946
02:13:51,410 --> 02:13:52,050
But that's okay.

2947
02:13:54,250 --> 02:13:56,010
It's just for dimension, right?

2948
02:13:56,590 --> 02:13:57,090
Uh-oh.

2949
02:13:57,090 --> 02:13:58,070
Wait, some of these are off.

2950
02:13:58,190 --> 02:13:58,530
Oh, okay.

2951
02:13:58,550 --> 02:13:59,170
Uh-oh.

2952
02:13:59,210 --> 02:13:59,430
Wait.

2953
02:13:59,590 --> 02:14:00,410
Push, push, push.

2954
02:14:00,670 --> 02:14:01,290
Push, push.

2955
02:14:01,530 --> 02:14:02,310
Push, push, push.

2956
02:14:02,510 --> 02:14:03,530
No, it's not already...

2957
02:14:03,530 --> 02:14:04,350
It's not already dried?

2958
02:14:04,550 --> 02:14:05,190
It can't be.

2959
02:14:05,610 --> 02:14:06,170
Uh-oh.

2960
02:14:06,210 --> 02:14:07,090
I think it's already dried.

2961
02:14:07,970 --> 02:14:08,630
No way.

2962
02:14:08,870 --> 02:14:09,270
No!

2963
02:14:09,510 --> 02:14:10,390
It's a little...

2964
02:14:13,580 --> 02:14:14,540
It's okay.

2965
02:14:15,200 --> 02:14:15,640
It's...

2966
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:16,520
It's...

2967
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:17,860
It's nature!

2968
02:14:19,220 --> 02:14:21,140
Nature is never perfect!

2969
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:24,480
Nature is never perfect.

2970
02:14:27,380 --> 02:14:29,220
Now, this one goes on...

2971
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:30,680
How so?

2972
02:14:35,470 --> 02:14:36,510
Like this?

2973
02:14:38,630 --> 02:14:40,070
How does this go here?

2974
02:14:40,930 --> 02:14:41,750
Like this.

2975
02:14:43,570 --> 02:14:45,250
Oh, that's so cool!

2976
02:14:46,710 --> 02:14:47,870
That's so neat.

2977
02:14:51,980 --> 02:14:54,480
I got a little bit on the tip.

2978
02:14:55,480 --> 02:14:56,160
That's okay.

2979
02:14:58,740 --> 02:15:00,500
I'm just gonna glue the corner then.

2980
02:15:01,720 --> 02:15:03,380
I'm too scared of doing the rest.

2981
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:05,320
I'm gonna glue this.

2982
02:15:05,340 --> 02:15:06,000
Like so.

2983
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:10,160
Okay.

2984
02:15:10,520 --> 02:15:12,200
Like... like so.

2985
02:15:12,920 --> 02:15:13,980
I think it'll stay.

2986
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:16,200
I think.

2987
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:18,040
I think it'll still stay.

2988
02:15:18,680 --> 02:15:19,400
I think.

2989
02:15:19,980 --> 02:15:21,880
I think it will still... oh shoot.

2990
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:25,680
There.

2991
02:15:27,660 --> 02:15:28,500
Yeah, perfect.

2992
02:15:29,060 --> 02:15:29,740
Perfection, perfection.

2993
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:36,440
Okay.

2994
02:15:37,220 --> 02:15:38,040
There we go.

2995
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:38,980
Yeah!

2996
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:40,520
Wow!

2997
02:15:41,620 --> 02:15:44,120
Our Sakura is so beautiful!

2998
02:15:45,240 --> 02:15:46,360
Oh my gosh.

2999
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:48,120
I like this side better.

3000
02:15:50,740 --> 02:15:51,860
This side looks good.

3001
02:15:51,940 --> 02:15:52,600
This side looks good.

3002
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:53,880
Doesn't it?

3003
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:54,580
Oh, there we go.

3004
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:55,360
Doesn't it?

3005
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:56,820
Nature is never perfect.

3006
02:15:57,800 --> 02:15:59,260
The rules of nature.

3007
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:02,280
Thanks for the super chat.

3008
02:16:08,460 --> 02:16:11,140
Guys, I feel so discouraged with my chair.

3009
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:15,220
I feel...

3010
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:16,860
What happened?

3011
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,620
What if... maybe... maybe it's just something weird and I...

3012
02:16:20,620 --> 02:16:22,820
I just... I just don't know what happened.

3013
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:23,840
I don't know what happened.

3014
02:16:24,580 --> 02:16:25,680
When I turn...

3015
02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:26,460
Oh my gosh.

3016
02:16:26,700 --> 02:16:27,140
Oh.

3017
02:16:27,660 --> 02:16:28,320
Okay, hold on.

3018
02:16:28,460 --> 02:16:29,960
I'm gonna take off my headphones real quick.

3019
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:32,540
Oh gosh.

3020
02:16:35,060 --> 02:16:37,000
I'm wondering if something like got stuck?

3021
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:46,060
Oh!

3022
02:16:46,060 --> 02:16:46,620
Oh!

3023
02:16:47,940 --> 02:16:48,860
I'm an idiot.

3024
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:54,760
I couldn't turn my chair because the metal bar that I told you that started hanging down below...

3025
02:16:54,760 --> 02:16:58,060
was just... was stuck on the ground.

3026
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:01,620
I can turn it still.

3027
02:17:01,960 --> 02:17:02,540
Oh, okay.

3028
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:04,200
It's just the... it's just the little...

3029
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:05,340
It's just...

3030
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:08,440
It's just that.

3031
02:17:08,540 --> 02:17:09,740
It's just this thing.

3032
02:17:12,100 --> 02:17:14,900
I was like, oh my gosh, why can't I turn my chair all of a sudden?

3033
02:17:15,140 --> 02:17:15,980
What's going on?

3034
02:17:21,830 --> 02:17:22,210
C...

3035
02:17:25,030 --> 02:17:25,410
31.

3036
02:17:28,230 --> 02:17:29,370
We need C31.

3037
02:17:32,890 --> 02:17:36,090
Oh my gosh, this is also going on the same branch.

3038
02:17:37,010 --> 02:17:37,970
This one right here.

3039
02:17:38,490 --> 02:17:38,870
C31.

3040
02:17:41,810 --> 02:17:42,190
Okay.

3041
02:17:42,190 --> 02:17:44,150
Wow, this is really full tree, isn't it?

3042
02:17:45,970 --> 02:17:46,570
C.

3043
02:17:49,930 --> 02:17:50,530
C.

3044
02:17:52,090 --> 02:17:56,550
This part is like hanging on by a literal thread.

3045
02:17:56,850 --> 02:17:58,750
I'm like, come on.

3046
02:17:58,850 --> 02:17:59,870
I'll need you later.

3047
02:17:59,950 --> 02:18:01,350
Just hold on for a bit.

3048
02:18:01,710 --> 02:18:02,750
That's C1.

3049
02:18:03,890 --> 02:18:10,690
I need C31 and I glue it to the top of our little branch.

3050
02:18:13,090 --> 02:18:13,690
Duh.

3051
02:18:15,150 --> 02:18:16,070
Right here.

3052
02:18:19,330 --> 02:18:20,170
This part.

3053
02:18:20,590 --> 02:18:21,190
Hold.

3054
02:18:22,630 --> 02:18:23,230
Hold.

3055
02:18:28,020 --> 02:18:29,320
I'm kind of confused.

3056
02:18:30,060 --> 02:18:32,860
I'm confused always, but you know.

3057
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:34,960
Glue has shown.

3058
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:40,300
It's kind of tricky though.

3059
02:18:40,380 --> 02:18:40,940
Like here?

3060
02:18:41,420 --> 02:18:42,700
I guess like that?

3061
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:45,060
I guess?

3062
02:18:45,640 --> 02:18:46,540
I think?

3063
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:47,860
I don't know.

3064
02:18:48,260 --> 02:18:50,640
Am I gluing it on the branch or on the back?

3065
02:18:50,640 --> 02:18:51,220
On the back of the...

3066
02:18:52,880 --> 02:18:54,240
I can't tell.

3067
02:18:56,920 --> 02:18:58,200
God couldn't.

3068
02:18:58,200 --> 02:18:59,600
Thanks for the gift.

3069
02:19:01,560 --> 02:19:04,940
I guess it doesn't have to be perfect.

3070
02:19:05,540 --> 02:19:06,180
Nature.

3071
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:10,780
Nature is not perfect.

3072
02:19:11,180 --> 02:19:13,020
Do you guys want to see something I can do with my hands?

3073
02:19:13,300 --> 02:19:14,880
I can wiggle my hands.

3074
02:19:16,660 --> 02:19:17,980
In a cool way.

3075
02:19:19,660 --> 02:19:20,020
Don't...

3076
02:19:20,020 --> 02:19:20,940
Look at that part.

3077
02:19:21,260 --> 02:19:21,900
Okay, ready?

3078
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:25,460
That's not the wiggle.

3079
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:26,880
Watch.

3080
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:27,780
Watch.

3081
02:19:28,140 --> 02:19:28,860
Watch.

3082
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:29,680
Ready?

3083
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:30,440
Ready?

3084
02:19:30,640 --> 02:19:31,360
Ready?

3085
02:19:31,720 --> 02:19:32,020
Ready?

3086
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:37,760
Ready?

3087
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:43,520
Ready?

3088
02:19:46,480 --> 02:19:47,200
Ready?

3089
02:19:48,500 --> 02:19:49,220
Ready?

3090
02:19:49,620 --> 02:19:49,940
Ready?

3091
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:01,120
Isn't that pretty cool?

3092
02:20:09,260 --> 02:20:10,760
Easily distracted Oshii.

3093
02:20:18,370 --> 02:20:20,750
Pretty good, but can you go the other way?

3094
02:20:54,310 --> 02:20:54,830
So it's just this?

3095
02:20:58,350 --> 02:20:59,370
And this.

3096
02:20:59,690 --> 02:21:01,310
So if I go...

3097
02:21:07,980 --> 02:21:10,800
By golly, I'm doing it!

3098
02:21:21,060 --> 02:21:25,120
It's like patting your tummy and rubbing your head.

3099
02:21:30,020 --> 02:21:30,420
Doing

3100
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:39,600
it!

3101
02:21:52,210 --> 02:21:53,710
This way is way easier.

3102
02:21:58,410 --> 02:21:59,370
By George!

3103
02:22:06,780 --> 02:22:08,080
It looks so bad!

3104
02:22:08,320 --> 02:22:09,360
It looks so ugly!

3105
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:10,640
No, no, no.

3106
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,060
No, no, no, no.

3107
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:14,900
No, no, no, no, no.

3108
02:22:19,780 --> 02:22:20,260
Anyway.

3109
02:22:25,660 --> 02:22:26,880
This part's confusing.

3110
02:22:34,280 --> 02:22:36,540
Glue as shown.

3111
02:22:38,180 --> 02:22:39,320
Shown what?

3112
02:22:40,440 --> 02:22:42,100
I think it goes like this?

3113
02:22:44,220 --> 02:22:46,680
I think it goes up here.

3114
02:22:47,700 --> 02:22:48,620
I think.

3115
02:22:51,740 --> 02:22:53,020
I think so.

3116
02:22:53,460 --> 02:22:54,760
Or reverse.

3117
02:22:55,340 --> 02:22:56,020
Reverse!

3118
02:22:56,060 --> 02:22:56,480
Reverse!

3119
02:22:57,420 --> 02:22:58,100
Reverse!

3120
02:22:58,140 --> 02:22:58,480
Reverse!

3121
02:22:58,480 --> 02:22:58,660
No.

3122
02:22:59,460 --> 02:23:00,800
I think that's too high up.

3123
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:04,180
I think.

3124
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:05,460
I'm confused.

3125
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:07,420
You should start a Discord.

3126
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:12,480
There's a fan Discord, but I have no plans to start my own.

3127
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:20,000
I'm sure if you were curious about the fan Discord, you could find it somewhere.

3128
02:23:20,680 --> 02:23:22,380
Someone will give you the link, probably.

3129
02:23:23,080 --> 02:23:24,400
I do not have it.

3130
02:23:25,480 --> 02:23:26,700
I'm not in it.

3131
02:23:26,780 --> 02:23:28,620
They won't let me be in it.

3132
02:23:28,980 --> 02:23:29,560
You know what?

3133
02:23:29,560 --> 02:23:30,760
I don't want to be in it either.

3134
02:23:31,100 --> 02:23:31,460
You know what?

3135
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:32,640
What if I make my own Discord?

3136
02:23:32,640 --> 02:23:34,780
With Blackjack and hookers.

3137
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:35,420
You know what?

3138
02:23:35,460 --> 02:23:36,200
Forget the Discord.

3139
02:23:36,560 --> 02:23:37,520
I'm just gonna...

3140
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:38,720
You know what?

3141
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:40,600
I'm just gonna get the Blackjack.

3142
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:44,880
Hold on.

3143
02:23:47,780 --> 02:23:49,060
I'm cutting some pieces.

3144
02:23:50,740 --> 02:23:51,260
Okay.

3145
02:23:51,320 --> 02:23:53,160
I can't tell if it's up or down.

3146
02:23:55,160 --> 02:23:56,300
We're all around.

3147
02:23:58,040 --> 02:23:59,980
I guess it kinda looks the same.

3148
02:24:00,520 --> 02:24:01,820
Regardless of what I do.

3149
02:24:04,020 --> 02:24:04,540
Okay.

3150
02:24:04,620 --> 02:24:05,520
I'm gonna do it.

3151
02:24:06,640 --> 02:24:07,300
Hold on.

3152
02:24:07,360 --> 02:24:08,100
I'm cutting.

3153
02:24:08,780 --> 02:24:09,580
I'm nipping.

3154
02:24:11,260 --> 02:24:12,260
I'm nipping.

3155
02:24:12,380 --> 02:24:12,840
I'm nipping.

3156
02:24:15,300 --> 02:24:17,240
It's the second time you said that reference today.

3157
02:24:23,500 --> 02:24:25,500
I just like that reference.

3158
02:24:26,820 --> 02:24:27,800
Bender's a funny guy.

3159
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:32,420
It's been a long time since I watched Futurama.

3160
02:24:32,600 --> 02:24:33,480
Aren't there new episodes?

3161
02:24:35,800 --> 02:24:36,280
Futurama?

3162
02:24:36,280 --> 02:24:36,700
A Futurama?

3163
02:24:37,800 --> 02:24:38,820
Are there any good?

3164
02:24:38,980 --> 02:24:39,320
Are there any good?

3165
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:42,660
The newer episodes?

3166
02:24:44,440 --> 02:24:44,920
What is it?

3167
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:45,640
I say that all the time.

3168
02:24:45,860 --> 02:24:47,360
I think it's one of the quotes.

3169
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:52,880
Besides the take my money quote, I feel like everybody is always quoting Blackjack and hookers.

3170
02:24:54,780 --> 02:24:57,640
You should start a Wisp colony on an oil rig in the Pacific.

3171
02:24:57,960 --> 02:24:59,880
Now that's an idea!

3172
02:25:00,480 --> 02:25:00,520
Now that's an idea!

3173
02:25:01,160 --> 02:25:02,540
We can call it...

3174
02:25:02,540 --> 02:25:02,760
We can call it...

3175
02:25:09,610 --> 02:25:10,210
W...S...F.

3176
02:25:10,210 --> 02:25:12,830
Wisp Sans Phantoms.

3177
02:25:15,890 --> 02:25:16,710
They're okay?

3178
02:25:17,810 --> 02:25:19,110
I think you need Disney Plus.

3179
02:25:19,610 --> 02:25:20,790
I don't have Disney Plus.

3180
02:25:24,570 --> 02:25:25,170
WSF.

3181
02:25:29,950 --> 02:25:30,990
It's on Hulu.

3182
02:25:31,650 --> 02:25:35,050
I watched... what was that other show that the creators did?

3183
02:25:37,050 --> 02:25:38,990
It was on Netflix, I think.

3184
02:25:42,630 --> 02:25:45,350
No Discord, so when next BreakStuff cover?

3185
02:25:47,350 --> 02:25:48,130
I don't know.

3186
02:25:51,050 --> 02:25:51,970
Oh, Disenchanted!

3187
02:25:52,030 --> 02:25:53,110
Yeah, Disenchanted.

3188
02:25:53,430 --> 02:25:54,210
It was okay.

3189
02:25:56,790 --> 02:25:58,490
I don't know if there's a new season.

3190
02:25:58,830 --> 02:26:00,810
If there is, I never watch it.

3191
02:26:00,970 --> 02:26:02,170
Yeah, the fantasy one.

3192
02:26:03,370 --> 02:26:05,750
Oh my gosh.

3193
02:26:06,710 --> 02:26:07,790
I think I need more glue on this.

3194
02:26:09,450 --> 02:26:11,370
I need more glue and more glue.

3195
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:28,040
Okay.

3196
02:26:29,560 --> 02:26:30,660
Okie-dokie.

3197
02:26:31,060 --> 02:26:34,120
Would a Wisp Sans Phantoms mean you aren't allowed in either?

3198
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:39,240
Other Phantoms... probably.

3199
02:26:40,360 --> 02:26:41,500
Wisps are special.

3200
02:26:42,540 --> 02:26:43,220
And me.

3201
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:46,660
She broke her chair.

3202
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:49,360
Oh yeah, Mint already broke stuff.

3203
02:26:51,080 --> 02:26:52,760
Give me something to break.

3204
02:26:53,260 --> 02:26:54,880
About my heckin' chair.

3205
02:26:56,500 --> 02:26:58,340
I hope you know I bought a new chair.

3206
02:27:05,290 --> 02:27:07,210
Trying to get the glue out from the...

3207
02:27:07,210 --> 02:27:08,310
That looks good, I think.

3208
02:27:08,970 --> 02:27:09,650
So far.

3209
02:27:10,150 --> 02:27:11,190
Oh my gosh, you guys.

3210
02:27:11,250 --> 02:27:12,750
We're going to the next page.

3211
02:27:14,130 --> 02:27:14,970
No way.

3212
02:27:15,590 --> 02:27:17,050
No way, no way, no way.

3213
02:27:17,270 --> 02:27:18,030
Page five!

3214
02:27:23,250 --> 02:27:24,210
Page five!

3215
02:27:24,210 --> 02:27:24,590
Page five!

3216
02:27:24,590 --> 02:27:25,670
Yeah, you're special, alright.

3217
02:27:25,770 --> 02:27:26,590
What do you mean by that?

3218
02:27:26,810 --> 02:27:27,730
I don't trust you.

3219
02:27:28,830 --> 02:27:30,070
What do you mean by that?

3220
02:27:33,920 --> 02:27:35,880
I have to fix my gloves.

3221
02:27:36,100 --> 02:27:37,120
My gloves.

3222
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:38,340
My gloves.

3223
02:27:38,700 --> 02:27:39,420
My gloves.

3224
02:27:43,220 --> 02:27:44,260
Um... F9.

3225
02:27:46,860 --> 02:27:49,160
F, F, F, F...

3226
02:27:50,980 --> 02:27:51,500
F9!

3227
02:27:53,840 --> 02:27:55,760
Wait, where'd this other F piece go?

3228
02:27:55,760 --> 02:27:56,380
Uh-oh.

3229
02:27:56,520 --> 02:27:58,320
Wait, we lost the biggest F...

3230
02:27:58,320 --> 02:27:58,720
Wait.

3231
02:27:59,520 --> 02:28:00,940
Wait, I lost this piece!

3232
02:28:02,300 --> 02:28:02,920
Uh-oh.

3233
02:28:04,300 --> 02:28:04,920
Uh-oh.

3234
02:28:07,360 --> 02:28:07,800
Wait!

3235
02:28:08,580 --> 02:28:09,480
Where did it go?

3236
02:28:09,660 --> 02:28:11,600
It's not what we need, but where is it?

3237
02:28:11,680 --> 02:28:12,560
It's just gone!

3238
02:28:16,200 --> 02:28:18,060
It's not with the rest of the Fs.

3239
02:28:18,960 --> 02:28:19,580
Uh-oh.

3240
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:21,000
Huh?

3241
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:21,080
Huh?

3242
02:28:23,620 --> 02:28:26,380
It's literally not in the pile that I have.

3243
02:28:32,200 --> 02:28:33,720
But it's so huge!

3244
02:28:33,940 --> 02:28:34,260
You know what?

3245
02:28:34,380 --> 02:28:35,220
I'll save it.

3246
02:28:35,260 --> 02:28:36,500
That's a later Minto problem.

3247
02:28:39,400 --> 02:28:40,560
F9 is...

3248
02:28:42,920 --> 02:28:44,360
No, that's F6.

3249
02:28:44,580 --> 02:28:45,360
I was reading...

3250
02:28:45,360 --> 02:28:48,240
I read the six upside down as a nine.

3251
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:50,560
Hold on.

3252
02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:52,000
Let's read it properly.

3253
02:28:53,160 --> 02:28:53,740
F9!

3254
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:55,440
Okay.

3255
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:55,960
Ooh.

3256
02:28:56,160 --> 02:28:56,940
This one's tricky.

3257
02:28:57,320 --> 02:28:58,860
Okay, we got this.

3258
02:28:58,980 --> 02:29:00,280
Okay, we got this.

3259
02:29:00,360 --> 02:29:01,200
Oh, this one's tricky.

3260
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:03,000
Oh, this one's tricky.

3261
02:29:03,540 --> 02:29:03,980
Okay.

3262
02:29:04,460 --> 02:29:05,320
Small, small.

3263
02:29:05,780 --> 02:29:07,040
Small, small, small.

3264
02:29:08,220 --> 02:29:09,040
Small, small.

3265
02:29:09,140 --> 02:29:09,360
Sm 감사.

3266
02:29:09,360 --> 02:29:09,420
Small, small, small.

3267
02:29:12,080 --> 02:29:16,360
It's the thing that reminds me of Shoujo Rei.

3268
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:19,920
Flashback, Semi no Koe.

3269
02:29:20,680 --> 02:29:23,960
Nina no Wakara no Kimi.

3270
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:24,840
Sorry.

3271
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:29,480
Come on, there we go.

3272
02:29:29,560 --> 02:29:29,900
Nice.

3273
02:29:30,040 --> 02:29:31,300
I heard a snap.

3274
02:29:32,660 --> 02:29:33,780
I'm the chiropractor.

3275
02:29:33,900 --> 02:29:35,320
Let me adjust your bones.

3276
02:29:38,680 --> 02:29:39,360
Yay!

3277
02:29:39,360 --> 02:29:45,980
F9, C17, C23.

3278
02:29:47,620 --> 02:29:50,040
Where did this other F piece go?

3279
02:29:51,620 --> 02:29:52,380
Craziness.

3280
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:53,540
It's a mystery.

3281
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:53,960
See?

3282
02:29:55,680 --> 02:29:56,440
17.

3283
02:29:59,380 --> 02:30:00,140
17.

3284
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:05,720
It's like the same one, just flatter.

3285
02:30:06,360 --> 02:30:07,120
Thinner.

3286
02:30:11,020 --> 02:30:12,240
There we go.

3287
02:30:12,420 --> 02:30:13,160
17.

3288
02:30:13,700 --> 02:30:15,300
And 23.

3289
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:30,360
Nice.

3290
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:33,800
Trying to keep this one.

3291
02:30:33,820 --> 02:30:36,000
Trying to keep it held on.

3292
02:30:36,500 --> 02:30:38,120
The goblin took it.

3293
02:30:39,240 --> 02:30:40,400
They're gnomes.

3294
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:41,160
Get it right.

3295
02:30:41,500 --> 02:30:42,560
There's not goblins.

3296
02:30:42,760 --> 02:30:43,960
Only gnomes.

3297
02:30:44,800 --> 02:30:46,260
Am I gluing this?

3298
02:30:47,100 --> 02:30:47,680
Or...

3299
02:30:51,510 --> 02:30:53,360
Okay, this part is a little confusing.

3300
02:30:54,320 --> 02:30:55,740
F9 was this one.

3301
02:30:58,530 --> 02:31:02,000
Which we have this side, this white side out.

3302
02:31:03,320 --> 02:31:03,900
Imp.

3303
02:31:04,140 --> 02:31:04,580
No!

3304
02:31:05,460 --> 02:31:06,000
Gnomes!

3305
02:31:06,540 --> 02:31:08,620
You're gonna make them more angry at me.

3306
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:11,000
Because you're mislabeling them.

3307
02:31:13,440 --> 02:31:15,160
They're gonna be more angry at me.

3308
02:31:16,140 --> 02:31:17,420
Oh, I'm gluing it.

3309
02:31:18,580 --> 02:31:23,580
Why didn't they just paint both sides instead of making me have more work for myself?

3310
02:31:23,960 --> 02:31:25,200
Is my question.

3311
02:31:28,340 --> 02:31:28,880
Why?

3312
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:31,160
Why didn't they just paint both sides?

3313
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:45,080
Hmm.

3314
02:31:45,740 --> 02:31:46,320
It's me.

3315
02:31:46,380 --> 02:31:46,900
I'm Shoujo Rei.

3316
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:48,820
Got any other ghastly songs in the works?

3317
02:31:51,020 --> 02:31:53,660
I'll slowly pay my home fees to the gnome...

3318
02:31:53,660 --> 02:31:56,880
Oh, also I'll slowly pay my home fees to the gnome owners association.

3319
02:31:58,100 --> 02:31:58,980
The gnome.

3320
02:32:03,650 --> 02:32:04,330
That's good.

3321
02:32:04,610 --> 02:32:05,310
That's good.

3322
02:32:06,270 --> 02:32:07,910
So you don't mistake the directions.

3323
02:32:08,530 --> 02:32:08,970
Oh.

3324
02:32:13,130 --> 02:32:14,670
Why do you have to be so sensible?

3325
02:32:30,910 --> 02:32:32,990
That seems to be...

3326
02:32:32,990 --> 02:32:33,550
Oh!

3327
02:32:33,810 --> 02:32:36,390
I pressed down and so much glue came oozing out.

3328
02:32:36,450 --> 02:32:38,410
I think I'm putting too much glue on this thing, you guys.

3329
02:32:39,550 --> 02:32:41,710
I think I'm overdoing it on the glue.

3330
02:32:42,390 --> 02:32:45,230
You legally cannot own a gnome.

3331
02:32:46,370 --> 02:32:47,890
In what country?

3332
02:32:48,290 --> 02:32:49,010
Tell me.

3333
02:32:49,470 --> 02:32:49,950
Where?

3334
02:32:50,870 --> 02:32:51,790
Name the law.

3335
02:32:51,910 --> 02:32:52,690
The section.

3336
02:32:52,910 --> 02:32:53,310
Everything.

3337
02:32:55,490 --> 02:32:57,610
And then I'll tell you I'm not from there.

3338
02:33:02,320 --> 02:33:03,640
Get ghosted.

3339
02:33:05,140 --> 02:33:06,340
No mania.

3340
02:33:13,080 --> 02:33:13,760
Fake.

3341
02:33:15,380 --> 02:33:16,060
Fake.

3342
02:33:16,400 --> 02:33:18,080
Gotta sand this bottom part.

3343
02:33:21,910 --> 02:33:23,890
The law didn't stop Willy Wonka.

3344
02:33:25,750 --> 02:33:27,970
He's convinced he saved those guys.

3345
02:33:28,290 --> 02:33:28,930
Isn't he?

3346
02:33:29,530 --> 02:33:30,210
Actually...

3347
02:33:31,030 --> 02:33:34,410
Okay, so the Johnny Depp one was more accurate...

3348
02:33:34,410 --> 02:33:35,390
than...

3349
02:33:35,390 --> 02:33:37,310
the Gene Wilder one, right?

3350
02:33:38,870 --> 02:33:39,530
I don't...

3351
02:33:39,530 --> 02:33:43,110
I don't think in the Gene Wilder one they touch on how he got the gnomes.

3352
02:33:43,130 --> 02:33:44,330
I mean the Oompa Loompas.

3353
02:33:44,890 --> 02:33:45,330
But...

3354
02:33:45,330 --> 02:33:49,030
In Johnny Depp one, he like goes to the forest and then...

3355
02:33:49,710 --> 02:33:50,350
steals them?

3356
02:33:50,450 --> 02:33:51,110
I don't actually...

3357
02:33:51,110 --> 02:33:51,950
How does he acquire them?

3358
02:33:52,210 --> 02:33:53,050
Fan discord secured.

3359
02:33:53,230 --> 02:33:53,750
Thanks, Minto.

3360
02:33:54,090 --> 02:33:54,910
I got you!

3361
02:33:55,410 --> 02:33:55,830
Hehe.

3362
02:33:59,950 --> 02:34:01,150
Lore wise, yeah.

3363
02:34:01,470 --> 02:34:03,130
Gene Wilder was just happier.

3364
02:34:03,450 --> 02:34:03,890
Hahaha.

3365
02:34:05,390 --> 02:34:06,850
Johnny Depp is more in character.

3366
02:34:07,390 --> 02:34:09,430
Maybe that's why nobody likes it.

3367
02:34:09,490 --> 02:34:09,910
Because...

3368
02:34:09,910 --> 02:34:11,130
this character sucks.

3369
02:34:19,150 --> 02:34:20,030
I thought I...

3370
02:34:20,030 --> 02:34:21,110
I thought I had broken it.

3371
02:34:21,230 --> 02:34:21,890
See this piece?

3372
02:34:24,390 --> 02:34:25,350
Like stops...

3373
02:34:26,050 --> 02:34:26,710
at the end.

3374
02:34:26,790 --> 02:34:27,670
But this piece continues.

3375
02:34:28,130 --> 02:34:29,130
But it's obviously...

3376
02:34:29,130 --> 02:34:31,330
because it's supposed to go stuck into the ground.

3377
02:34:32,910 --> 02:34:34,110
Lured them with beans!

3378
02:34:34,450 --> 02:34:35,170
No way.

3379
02:34:35,230 --> 02:34:36,070
That's what he did actually?

3380
02:34:39,350 --> 02:34:44,030
The original author of the book actually hated the Gene Wilder version because of all the deviations.

3381
02:34:44,590 --> 02:34:46,130
Well, it also sounds like...

3382
02:34:46,130 --> 02:34:47,090
It sucked!

3383
02:34:47,610 --> 02:34:47,870
Hahaha.

3384
02:34:50,400 --> 02:34:52,440
You guys, I think I'm going to have to glue this one.

3385
02:34:53,360 --> 02:34:53,920
What the...

3386
02:34:57,250 --> 02:34:58,350
Send me your energy.

3387
02:34:59,810 --> 02:35:01,890
It's illegal in the country of your maid cafe.

3388
02:35:02,090 --> 02:35:02,490
Checkmate.

3389
02:35:02,890 --> 02:35:03,670
No, no, no.

3390
02:35:04,970 --> 02:35:06,030
Send me your energy.

3391
02:35:07,090 --> 02:35:08,230
And then I'll put it back on.

3392
02:35:08,490 --> 02:35:09,250
Because I'm shy.

3393
02:35:10,030 --> 02:35:10,470
Hahaha.

3394
02:35:10,550 --> 02:35:10,610
So...

3395
02:35:16,870 --> 02:35:17,290
Okay.

3396
02:35:17,990 --> 02:35:18,950
I'm going to do it.

3397
02:35:19,610 --> 02:35:20,450
But don't look.

3398
02:35:21,130 --> 02:35:21,550
Okay.

3399
02:35:23,350 --> 02:35:24,350
Don't look at my nails.

3400
02:35:24,570 --> 02:35:25,410
Because they look really bad.

3401
02:35:25,630 --> 02:35:25,930
Okay.

3402
02:35:26,310 --> 02:35:26,990
I'm scared.

3403
02:35:27,090 --> 02:35:28,070
No, I can't do this.

3404
02:35:28,390 --> 02:35:28,810
Hahaha.

3405
02:35:30,770 --> 02:35:31,390
I'm sorry.

3406
02:35:31,530 --> 02:35:32,250
I took your energy.

3407
02:35:32,550 --> 02:35:33,510
And I ate it.

3408
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:38,220
Hahaha.

3409
02:35:41,360 --> 02:35:42,020
Thank you.

3410
02:35:42,980 --> 02:35:43,660
Thank you.

3411
02:35:44,360 --> 02:35:45,000
Thank you.

3412
02:35:47,480 --> 02:35:48,600
If you saw it...

3413
02:35:48,600 --> 02:35:48,820
No, you didn't see it.

3414
02:35:48,820 --> 02:35:48,960
If you saw it...

3415
02:35:48,960 --> 02:35:49,460
No, you didn't.

3416
02:35:49,820 --> 02:35:50,900
If you saw it...

3417
02:35:50,900 --> 02:35:51,800
No, you didn't.

3418
02:35:52,460 --> 02:35:53,540
It's starting to get shaky.

3419
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:54,400
I wonder if I'm hungry.

3420
02:35:54,600 --> 02:35:55,680
I had some pizza.

3421
02:35:55,780 --> 02:35:57,460
But I didn't like it.

3422
02:36:01,410 --> 02:36:02,250
They like...

3423
02:36:02,250 --> 02:36:03,650
Put too much sauce.

3424
02:36:05,410 --> 02:36:07,270
And I'm not really a saucy gal.

3425
02:36:08,910 --> 02:36:10,290
Wait, but I'm saucy mint.

3426
02:36:11,650 --> 02:36:12,210
Uh oh.

3427
02:36:16,920 --> 02:36:17,360
Hmm.

3428
02:36:18,480 --> 02:36:20,280
Will you trust my energy?

3429
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:21,240
Hahaha.

3430
02:36:24,470 --> 02:36:24,910
Maybe.

3431
02:36:24,970 --> 02:36:25,210
Maybe.

3432
02:36:25,230 --> 02:36:25,930
I don't know.

3433
02:36:26,050 --> 02:36:26,670
Why?

3434
02:36:26,870 --> 02:36:27,910
Why shouldn't I trust you?

3435
02:36:29,190 --> 02:36:29,500
Ahem.

3436
02:36:32,310 --> 02:36:34,610
Well, if it isn't saucy mint.

3437
02:36:35,810 --> 02:36:36,430
Ah!

3438
02:36:45,640 --> 02:36:46,640
I did it.

3439
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:48,360
Hahaha.

3440
02:36:48,360 --> 02:36:49,000
Super chat.

3441
02:36:49,300 --> 02:36:50,600
You're coming to Anime North.

3442
02:36:51,260 --> 02:36:51,880
Um.

3443
02:36:52,900 --> 02:36:54,920
I don't think so.

3444
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:56,620
Um.

3445
02:36:57,280 --> 02:36:59,140
I don't think so.

3446
02:37:00,380 --> 02:37:02,260
I don't know when Anime North is.

3447
02:37:02,820 --> 02:37:03,660
Next year?

3448
02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:04,260
Next year?

3449
02:37:04,280 --> 02:37:07,460
I can only go to cons if I get invited, you guys.

3450
02:37:07,680 --> 02:37:12,760
And if I'm not invited, then, you know, I can't go.

3451
02:37:12,960 --> 02:37:17,500
So if you want me to go to a convention, you know, you could try asking them.

3452
02:37:17,740 --> 02:37:22,620
Be like, hey, I would really appreciate if you got the mint phantom.

3453
02:37:22,720 --> 02:37:23,040
Oh!

3454
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:23,300
Oh!

3455
02:37:23,880 --> 02:37:24,960
She's my favorite.

3456
02:37:28,900 --> 02:37:29,500
You know?

3457
02:37:35,430 --> 02:37:36,130
Truck con.

3458
02:37:36,270 --> 02:37:37,270
Yeah, but that was different.

3459
02:37:37,490 --> 02:37:37,930
That was...

3460
02:37:37,930 --> 02:37:38,310
They...

3461
02:37:38,310 --> 02:37:39,650
The truck people invited me.

3462
02:37:39,670 --> 02:37:39,970
Not the mint phantom.

3463
02:37:39,970 --> 02:37:40,310
Not the convention.

3464
02:37:45,170 --> 02:37:45,650
So...

3465
02:37:47,070 --> 02:37:47,550
Scandalous.

3466
02:37:47,590 --> 02:37:47,830
Stop.

3467
02:37:47,990 --> 02:37:48,430
Look.

3468
02:37:48,830 --> 02:37:49,470
Stop it.

3469
02:37:49,510 --> 02:37:49,890
Look.

3470
02:37:49,950 --> 02:37:50,930
I'm back to being ghostly.

3471
02:37:51,190 --> 02:37:51,670
Ghastly.

3472
02:37:51,750 --> 02:37:52,230
In fact.

3473
02:37:52,470 --> 02:37:54,730
If I didn't wear these, you wouldn't see nothing.

3474
02:37:54,750 --> 02:37:55,330
In fact.

3475
02:37:55,670 --> 02:37:56,150
Truly.

3476
02:37:56,590 --> 02:37:57,070
Yay!

3477
02:37:57,210 --> 02:37:59,190
We have a traffic thing!

3478
02:38:02,050 --> 02:38:03,370
Now I need...

3479
02:38:03,910 --> 02:38:06,090
It says, glue along the reference lines.

3480
02:38:06,290 --> 02:38:06,850
Got it.

3481
02:38:08,010 --> 02:38:09,590
I need C11.

3482
02:38:09,770 --> 02:38:09,950
C11.

3483
02:38:12,270 --> 02:38:13,770
Which is this guy.

3484
02:38:13,930 --> 02:38:15,390
This little cross right here.

3485
02:38:17,610 --> 02:38:18,730
Tiny hands.

3486
02:38:20,650 --> 02:38:23,310
Tiny hands to give you tiny beat down.

3487
02:38:24,410 --> 02:38:25,290
Smack down.

3488
02:38:27,270 --> 02:38:27,830
F8.

3489
02:38:29,190 --> 02:38:30,150
Back to F.

3490
02:38:41,110 --> 02:38:41,850
There we go.

3491
02:38:44,110 --> 02:38:44,670
Oh!

3492
02:38:44,670 --> 02:38:45,470
According to plan.

3493
02:38:45,630 --> 02:38:46,950
You want to get beat up?

3494
02:38:51,060 --> 02:38:51,620
Oh!

3495
02:38:51,620 --> 02:38:53,580
Why am I acting like I'm surprised with that?

3496
02:38:55,440 --> 02:38:58,500
You cry before stream, but I know you like it.

3497
02:38:59,720 --> 02:39:00,940
Minto hates us.

3498
02:39:01,340 --> 02:39:03,100
I wish you'd hate me more.

3499
02:39:05,640 --> 02:39:06,300
You know?

3500
02:39:08,120 --> 02:39:09,500
I know you like it.

3501
02:39:09,620 --> 02:39:10,360
What else do we need?

3502
02:39:10,880 --> 02:39:11,420
F8.

3503
02:39:11,460 --> 02:39:11,800
C11.

3504
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:12,540
C16.

3505
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:13,400
Oh!

3506
02:39:14,540 --> 02:39:15,080
C16.

3507
02:39:19,500 --> 02:39:20,040
C16?

3508
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:21,540
Oh!

3509
02:39:24,710 --> 02:39:26,730
Do I need C17 also?

3510
02:39:27,410 --> 02:39:28,450
Just 16?

3511
02:39:31,710 --> 02:39:32,310
Oh!

3512
02:39:32,370 --> 02:39:33,270
This is all C16.

3513
02:39:39,390 --> 02:39:41,030
Both of these are C16.

3514
02:39:42,750 --> 02:39:44,650
Make us feel alive, Minto.

3515
02:39:46,810 --> 02:39:47,410
16.

3516
02:39:48,670 --> 02:39:49,270
16.

3517
02:39:50,910 --> 02:39:51,730
There we go.

3518
02:39:52,150 --> 02:39:52,750
Wow.

3519
02:39:52,790 --> 02:39:53,350
This one's a lot.

3520
02:39:53,590 --> 02:39:54,190
C14.

3521
02:39:54,930 --> 02:39:55,830
This one.

3522
02:39:56,230 --> 02:39:56,830
This one.

3523
02:39:56,850 --> 02:39:58,030
And C15.

3524
02:39:58,810 --> 02:39:59,650
Okay.

3525
02:40:00,610 --> 02:40:01,450
Oh!

3526
02:40:01,490 --> 02:40:02,510
This one.

3527
02:40:03,170 --> 02:40:05,230
You've been invited to HandCon.

3528
02:40:05,650 --> 02:40:12,410
All you need to do is provide your fingerprint information.

3529
02:40:24,020 --> 02:40:24,860
Registered.

3530
02:40:27,140 --> 02:40:27,560
Okay.

3531
02:40:28,060 --> 02:40:28,480
16.

3532
02:40:29,400 --> 02:40:30,240
15.

3533
02:40:30,480 --> 02:40:30,960
Okay.

3534
02:40:30,980 --> 02:40:31,360
Got it.

3535
02:40:33,540 --> 02:40:35,120
And we're doing it...

3536
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:35,300
Oh!

3537
02:40:35,320 --> 02:40:36,280
This one.

3538
02:40:36,280 --> 02:40:37,600
On this side, I believe.

3539
02:40:38,700 --> 02:40:39,220
Yeah.

3540
02:40:40,420 --> 02:40:41,200
I believe.

3541
02:40:41,460 --> 02:40:41,800
I believe.

3542
02:40:43,940 --> 02:40:45,600
So this goes...

3543
02:40:47,240 --> 02:40:48,600
Wait, do we glue...

3544
02:40:49,380 --> 02:40:51,460
We glue this first, I think?

3545
02:40:52,440 --> 02:41:00,720
And then we glue it together, and then we put it here, and then we put these on here, and then we put...

3546
02:41:00,720 --> 02:41:03,820
Even though they look a little goofy, they look a little cheap.

3547
02:41:03,880 --> 02:41:04,360
That's okay.

3548
02:41:04,360 --> 02:41:04,520
Okay.

3549
02:41:04,840 --> 02:41:08,940
And then we put this... somewhere.

3550
02:41:12,660 --> 02:41:15,560
It says there's reference signs, but there's really not.

3551
02:41:16,780 --> 02:41:18,520
You just put it down.

3552
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:20,660
Wait, does this have writing on it?

3553
02:41:29,760 --> 02:41:32,320
It's like... almost hiragana.

3554
02:41:32,620 --> 02:41:33,160
Almost.

3555
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:35,420
Where did the other one go that I popped out?

3556
02:41:43,500 --> 02:41:44,200
Uh-oh.

3557
02:41:49,190 --> 02:41:49,850
Uh-oh.

3558
02:41:50,510 --> 02:41:52,970
A treasure mint running over me with her iPod.

3559
02:41:53,030 --> 02:41:53,890
I ran over you!

3560
02:41:55,470 --> 02:41:57,450
Oh wait, I do remember that.

3561
02:42:01,110 --> 02:42:02,870
I thought you meant like...

3562
02:42:04,370 --> 02:42:04,890
Unintentionally.

3563
02:42:07,470 --> 02:42:07,990
Guys.

3564
02:42:08,730 --> 02:42:09,550
Man overboard.

3565
02:42:11,410 --> 02:42:12,630
I lost a piece.

3566
02:42:16,620 --> 02:42:17,600
Man overboard.

3567
02:42:17,980 --> 02:42:19,000
Is that on my fingers?

3568
02:42:20,220 --> 02:42:20,740
No.

3569
02:42:31,380 --> 02:42:32,040
Uh-oh.

3570
02:42:38,300 --> 02:42:39,460
My tummy is rumbling.

3571
02:42:40,160 --> 02:42:40,940
Do we have cons?

3572
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,060
Can we give gifts at Otakuthon?

3573
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:44,680
Maybe.

3574
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:47,080
I might have to... I'll be honest.

3575
02:42:47,260 --> 02:42:49,080
I might have to start like...

3576
02:42:51,700 --> 02:42:53,480
So... I'm running out of space.

3577
02:42:55,460 --> 02:43:00,100
You guys, I can't even show you the box of stuff that I have from Off-Kai.

3578
02:43:00,320 --> 02:43:01,940
It's so huge.

3579
02:43:01,940 --> 02:43:03,500
I don't know.

3580
02:43:03,580 --> 02:43:04,640
It's just in the box.

3581
02:43:04,780 --> 02:43:05,920
I don't know where to put it.

3582
02:43:08,260 --> 02:43:09,680
I don't know where to put everything.

3583
02:43:12,660 --> 02:43:13,680
Suffering from success.

3584
02:43:14,360 --> 02:43:15,280
I guess so.

3585
02:43:15,980 --> 02:43:17,140
That's what you call that.

3586
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,220
Let's just glue these ones down for now that I have.

3587
02:43:21,680 --> 02:43:22,120
Hmm.

3588
02:43:23,060 --> 02:43:23,500
Hmm.

3589
02:43:24,320 --> 02:43:24,760
Hmm.

3590
02:43:27,020 --> 02:43:27,460
Hmm.

3591
02:43:28,740 --> 02:43:28,920
Hmm.

3592
02:43:30,680 --> 02:43:31,120
Hmm.

3593
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:31,200
Hmm.

3594
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:33,100
I'm trying to like find a way to display stuff.

3595
02:43:33,340 --> 02:43:34,340
But I'm also like...

3596
02:43:37,180 --> 02:43:37,640
Where...

3597
02:43:38,010 --> 02:43:39,600
Where can I display it?

3598
02:43:39,660 --> 02:43:41,140
I might have to buy more shelving.

3599
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:43,800
And more...

3600
02:43:46,340 --> 02:43:48,840
Maybe like display cabinet things.

3601
02:43:49,340 --> 02:43:50,180
Stuff like that.

3602
02:43:54,300 --> 02:43:55,020
No way.

3603
02:43:55,080 --> 02:43:56,340
I put too much glue on this?

3604
02:43:57,440 --> 02:43:58,140
You lie.

3605
02:43:59,870 --> 02:44:02,420
I put just an appropriate amount of glue on this.

3606
02:44:05,800 --> 02:44:07,140
Shelf building stream.

3607
02:44:08,560 --> 02:44:09,900
Download more shelf.

3608
02:44:10,240 --> 02:44:11,840
The maid cafe is only...

3609
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:15,340
You know, I have to have room for tables and chairs for patrons.

3610
02:44:16,870 --> 02:44:18,040
Otherwise, I'll go out of business.

3611
02:44:22,260 --> 02:44:23,960
Funds for renting a storefront.

3612
02:44:24,660 --> 02:44:25,240
Explainments.

3613
02:44:25,240 --> 02:44:25,800
Gifts.

3614
02:44:26,020 --> 02:44:26,880
And merch.

3615
02:44:28,140 --> 02:44:28,740
Good grade.

3616
02:44:28,780 --> 02:44:29,220
Perfect.

3617
02:44:29,560 --> 02:44:30,700
You solved it.

3618
02:44:30,780 --> 02:44:31,640
You solved...

3619
02:44:31,640 --> 02:44:32,720
You solved it.

3620
02:44:32,980 --> 02:44:33,800
You did it.

3621
02:44:33,960 --> 02:44:34,440
You.

3622
02:44:35,720 --> 02:44:36,200
Reared...

3623
02:44:36,980 --> 02:44:37,940
Reared logarithm.

3624
02:44:38,080 --> 02:44:39,380
You solved the problem.

3625
02:44:40,740 --> 02:44:41,700
You did it.

3626
02:44:41,760 --> 02:44:42,680
You did it.

3627
02:44:42,880 --> 02:44:44,540
The evil has been defeated.

3628
02:44:48,320 --> 02:44:53,320
I think I saw a tweet about a Hello Project idol who rents out a separate room just to store her fan letters and gifts.

3629
02:44:53,400 --> 02:44:54,020
No way.

3630
02:44:54,760 --> 02:44:55,900
New house fund?

3631
02:44:56,220 --> 02:44:56,660
No!

3632
02:44:57,420 --> 02:44:59,040
I like my maid cafe.

3633
02:45:01,780 --> 02:45:03,060
I like it!

3634
02:45:07,830 --> 02:45:08,590
I like it!

3635
02:45:08,590 --> 02:45:09,550
I gonna do it like that.

3636
02:45:11,170 --> 02:45:12,330
I gonna do it like that.

3637
02:45:15,250 --> 02:45:17,890
Did someone say, funding Mint's new house?

3638
02:45:21,830 --> 02:45:23,350
That's all the rage right now.

3639
02:45:23,410 --> 02:45:24,190
Trending on Twitter.

3640
02:45:26,830 --> 02:45:27,390
Funding.

3641
02:45:27,390 --> 02:45:27,570
Oh.

3642
02:45:27,930 --> 02:45:30,550
Funding this ghost's new haunting location.

3643
02:45:32,790 --> 02:45:34,530
Funding this ghost's new haunting location.

3644
02:45:34,530 --> 02:45:34,970
This is a museum.

3645
02:45:36,230 --> 02:45:37,710
I'd love to haunt that place.

3646
02:45:40,050 --> 02:45:41,790
Oh my gosh, this one is really tricky.

3647
02:45:50,850 --> 02:45:52,050
Maybe like that.

3648
02:45:52,590 --> 02:45:54,110
And then we just let it sit.

3649
02:45:55,270 --> 02:45:56,910
Let it... let it sit.

3650
02:45:58,090 --> 02:45:58,690
I think.

3651
02:46:01,570 --> 02:46:02,530
Here's a new house.

3652
02:46:02,650 --> 02:46:03,250
Oh, thank you!

3653
02:46:04,450 --> 02:46:05,830
Thanks for the super chat!

3654
02:46:12,930 --> 02:46:15,050
Alright, let's glue these guys on.

3655
02:46:16,030 --> 02:46:17,530
How should I glue them on?

3656
02:46:17,690 --> 02:46:19,250
Okay, the little...

3657
02:46:21,510 --> 02:46:28,790
There's like a... it's probably hard for you guys to see it, but there's a little shine direction and I want you to put it on the left.

3658
02:46:29,730 --> 02:46:32,830
So it looks like the light is coming from...

3659
02:46:33,250 --> 02:46:33,530
Oh my gosh.

3660
02:46:33,690 --> 02:46:34,110
Okay.

3661
02:46:34,810 --> 02:46:35,890
No gloves mode.

3662
02:46:39,650 --> 02:46:40,950
No gloves mode!

3663
02:46:46,990 --> 02:46:49,390
Will you be at convention con this year?

3664
02:46:49,590 --> 02:46:50,090
You know what?

3665
02:46:50,210 --> 02:46:53,550
Convention con is like my go-to every year.

3666
02:46:53,990 --> 02:46:54,970
Love that con.

3667
02:46:55,190 --> 02:46:55,970
Convention con.

3668
02:46:56,570 --> 02:46:57,930
So yeah, you'll see me there.

3669
02:47:00,930 --> 02:47:02,350
I need the glue.

3670
02:47:09,460 --> 02:47:10,100
I'm shy.

3671
02:47:36,020 --> 02:47:37,460
I think I put too much glue.

3672
02:47:42,460 --> 02:47:43,340
Oh my gosh.

3673
02:47:43,460 --> 02:47:43,640
No!

3674
02:47:43,840 --> 02:47:45,120
My X came off!

3675
02:47:49,420 --> 02:47:50,020
There we go.

3676
02:47:50,140 --> 02:47:50,560
There we go.

3677
02:47:51,040 --> 02:47:51,780
There we go.

3678
02:47:51,780 --> 02:47:52,260
There we go.

3679
02:47:52,960 --> 02:47:54,060
There we go!

3680
02:47:54,860 --> 02:47:56,680
Turn it around town, baby.

3681
02:47:57,580 --> 02:47:59,280
Oh, I sure hope this drive is clear!

3682
02:48:02,060 --> 02:48:03,400
There's too much glue!

3683
02:48:06,200 --> 02:48:07,240
Release the grippers?

3684
02:48:07,360 --> 02:48:08,800
No, I'm shy.

3685
02:48:09,500 --> 02:48:10,360
I'm shy ghost.

3686
02:48:11,660 --> 02:48:12,720
I'm shy ghost.

3687
02:48:12,800 --> 02:48:13,440
I can't.

3688
02:48:15,560 --> 02:48:18,320
It would be easier, but that's part of the challenge also.

3689
02:48:18,560 --> 02:48:19,560
It's with the gloves.

3690
02:48:21,340 --> 02:48:23,340
But also, I'm missing a thing.

3691
02:48:26,870 --> 02:48:27,370
There!

3692
02:48:27,870 --> 02:48:29,290
Oh my gosh, it looks so good!

3693
02:48:29,910 --> 02:48:30,890
From far away.

3694
02:48:31,650 --> 02:48:32,510
In the webcam.

3695
02:48:32,910 --> 02:48:33,950
It looks so great!

3696
02:48:34,310 --> 02:48:35,610
When you can't see the details.

3697
02:48:39,620 --> 02:48:41,060
You're just extreme, boss.

3698
02:48:41,140 --> 02:48:41,740
I'm extreme.

3699
02:48:43,500 --> 02:48:44,340
I'm extreme.

3700
02:48:52,100 --> 02:48:52,580
Hiya!

3701
02:48:55,760 --> 02:48:58,300
Um, I don't know where the other side of this went.

3702
02:48:59,200 --> 02:49:00,140
Oh my gosh.

3703
02:49:01,180 --> 02:49:02,960
What could have happened to it?

3704
02:49:07,810 --> 02:49:09,150
V for victory.

3705
02:49:10,030 --> 02:49:11,790
But no, we're missing a piece.

3706
02:49:12,350 --> 02:49:13,670
No victory here.

3707
02:49:15,510 --> 02:49:17,070
I hope I'm not like sitting on it.

3708
02:49:17,130 --> 02:49:18,610
I hope I didn't roll over top of it.

3709
02:49:22,780 --> 02:49:24,560
It's not on my dress.

3710
02:49:27,860 --> 02:49:29,100
I have no idea.

3711
02:49:30,960 --> 02:49:32,220
Where could it be?

3712
02:49:33,520 --> 02:49:35,040
Unless it's still...

3713
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:35,300
Oh!

3714
02:49:36,400 --> 02:49:38,160
You guys, it was still...

3715
02:49:38,160 --> 02:49:40,560
It was still attached to the paper.

3716
02:49:41,760 --> 02:49:42,880
That's what happened.

3717
02:49:45,920 --> 02:49:47,500
It was still attached.

3718
02:49:50,300 --> 02:49:50,820
Nice.

3719
02:49:54,940 --> 02:49:55,460
Okay.

3720
02:49:56,260 --> 02:49:57,740
Then I glue it all together.

3721
02:50:01,750 --> 02:50:03,230
No, not to the chair.

3722
02:50:03,230 --> 02:50:03,430
Okay.

3723
02:50:03,430 --> 02:50:03,710
Or...

3724
02:50:06,690 --> 02:50:08,050
Okay, I have to glue it like this.

3725
02:50:08,310 --> 02:50:09,610
And then I glue it in the middle.

3726
02:50:12,550 --> 02:50:13,450
Okay, glue.

3727
02:50:14,370 --> 02:50:16,030
I think I might stop after this one.

3728
02:50:16,110 --> 02:50:16,970
Because I'm getting hungry.

3729
02:50:17,650 --> 02:50:19,750
Getting hungry is making me get a little shaky.

3730
02:50:21,930 --> 02:50:22,330
Ah...

3731
02:50:24,410 --> 02:50:25,430
Oh my gosh!

3732
02:50:25,550 --> 02:50:26,150
Too much glue!

3733
02:50:26,410 --> 02:50:27,030
Too much glue!

3734
02:50:27,330 --> 02:50:27,990
Too much glue!

3735
02:50:28,490 --> 02:50:28,890
Too...

3736
02:50:32,210 --> 02:50:33,230
Too much glue!

3737
02:50:42,900 --> 02:50:44,640
But we're making progress.

3738
02:50:44,900 --> 02:50:47,680
I thought I would at least have like a base built or something.

3739
02:50:48,700 --> 02:50:50,960
I thought maybe that's where we would start.

3740
02:50:51,240 --> 02:50:58,660
I thought that they would be like, Okay, we're gonna make the build... No, I guess you have to do the inside to build around it, don't you?

3741
02:51:00,160 --> 02:51:01,000
I guess so.

3742
02:51:01,660 --> 02:51:02,820
No eating the glue.

3743
02:51:05,120 --> 02:51:07,860
I'm licking it from my glove.

3744
02:51:10,560 --> 02:51:15,500
I'm gonna have some mango.

3745
02:51:16,020 --> 02:51:17,700
Have some mango right here.

3746
02:51:18,300 --> 02:51:19,100
Hold on.

3747
02:51:19,220 --> 02:51:20,140
I'll show you guys.

3748
02:51:21,640 --> 02:51:22,400
One second.

3749
02:51:24,760 --> 02:51:26,060
I have to reach over.

3750
02:51:29,100 --> 02:51:32,220
I have some dried mango slices.

3751
02:51:37,930 --> 02:51:39,170
When do these expire?

3752
02:51:46,840 --> 02:51:48,720
It doesn't mold or anything, right?

3753
02:51:49,460 --> 02:51:51,180
There's only a couple pieces in here.

3754
02:51:53,180 --> 02:51:53,760
Yay!

3755
02:51:54,080 --> 02:51:54,660
Mango!

3756
02:51:56,460 --> 02:51:57,040
Yummy!

3757
02:52:03,420 --> 02:52:05,260
It only expired last month.

3758
02:52:10,950 --> 02:52:11,910
So it's fine.

3759
02:52:23,890 --> 02:52:25,090
Best buyer expired.

3760
02:52:29,370 --> 02:52:30,010
I don't know.

3761
02:52:30,030 --> 02:52:30,490
It doesn't say.

3762
02:52:30,770 --> 02:52:31,810
Fresh food, bud.

3763
02:52:32,750 --> 02:52:36,150
This is how slow I am to eat my food sometimes, though.

3764
02:52:48,940 --> 02:52:49,540
Tastes fine.

3765
02:52:56,920 --> 02:52:58,340
Yeah, and I'm already a ghost.

3766
02:52:58,620 --> 02:52:59,220
Who cares?

3767
02:52:59,260 --> 02:52:59,640
Look at that.

3768
02:53:01,400 --> 02:53:02,340
That's not mold.

3769
02:53:04,100 --> 02:53:05,360
That's how it looks.

3770
02:53:14,120 --> 02:53:15,240
Would you like this?

3771
02:53:21,680 --> 02:53:22,420
Oh, it's glue?

3772
02:53:22,680 --> 02:53:24,860
No, now I have mango on my fingers.

3773
02:53:26,180 --> 02:53:28,240
Oh, I think I ingested a little bit of glue.

3774
02:53:28,620 --> 02:53:30,000
That was non-toxic.

3775
02:53:36,440 --> 02:53:42,020
Your old mango can be resuscitated by mixing it with expired coffee jelly.

3776
02:53:49,280 --> 02:53:52,040
I'm still in a dream.

3777
02:53:54,440 --> 02:53:55,400
Glue eater.

3778
02:54:22,120 --> 02:54:23,020
Paste eater.

3779
02:54:24,580 --> 02:54:25,320
Oh, I agree.

3780
02:54:25,420 --> 02:54:25,960
That sounds better.

3781
02:54:26,400 --> 02:54:28,200
Alright, let's glue this bad boy on.

3782
02:54:30,700 --> 02:54:32,820
Right about... it says just... says...

3783
02:54:32,820 --> 02:54:34,220
Glue it centrally.

3784
02:54:35,460 --> 02:54:36,060
Oh, wait.

3785
02:54:36,080 --> 02:54:36,300
Hold on.

3786
02:54:36,400 --> 02:54:39,100
I want to sand down some of the edges first.

3787
02:54:44,540 --> 02:54:45,100
Glue it centrally.

3788
02:54:45,100 --> 02:54:46,000
Glue centrally.

3789
02:54:48,820 --> 02:54:51,140
And then that will lead us to...

3790
02:54:52,040 --> 02:54:53,000
Step 7!

3791
02:54:55,340 --> 02:54:55,820
Yeah!

3792
02:54:56,940 --> 02:54:58,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3793
02:54:59,660 --> 02:55:02,280
I'll show you guys my revolver that I made too.

3794
02:55:03,100 --> 02:55:03,580
Before.

3795
02:55:05,420 --> 02:55:05,900
And...

3796
02:55:08,280 --> 02:55:09,240
So awesome.

3797
02:55:09,900 --> 02:55:11,120
Which side do I...

3798
02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:14,180
Okay, I think I just paste it just like around...

3799
02:55:14,180 --> 02:55:14,520
You know what?

3800
02:55:14,540 --> 02:55:18,040
I'm just gonna put a little dab on here.

3801
02:55:21,880 --> 02:55:22,800
Not too much.

3802
02:55:23,060 --> 02:55:24,880
Please, don't come spitting out.

3803
02:55:25,040 --> 02:55:25,800
Don't spit out!

3804
02:55:25,980 --> 02:55:26,840
Don't spit out!

3805
02:55:27,860 --> 02:55:29,960
I think it's drying on like the tip.

3806
02:55:30,100 --> 02:55:31,340
And so it's spitting out.

3807
02:55:31,980 --> 02:55:32,320
Okay.

3808
02:55:33,500 --> 02:55:35,080
Just a dab will do ya.

3809
02:55:35,160 --> 02:55:35,840
Yeah, there we go.

3810
02:55:36,940 --> 02:55:37,660
A little more.

3811
02:55:40,940 --> 02:55:41,380
There.

3812
02:55:41,760 --> 02:55:42,780
That's... I did too much.

3813
02:55:44,200 --> 02:55:45,460
Why does this happen to me?

3814
02:55:47,540 --> 02:55:48,200
There we go.

3815
02:55:48,600 --> 02:55:49,560
There we go!

3816
02:55:51,060 --> 02:55:52,420
Oh god, she has a gun.

3817
02:55:52,760 --> 02:55:53,200
Yeah!

3818
02:55:54,220 --> 02:55:55,500
I have a gun!

3819
02:55:56,560 --> 02:55:58,620
Usually nobody allows me to have a gun.

3820
02:56:01,200 --> 02:56:01,640
Minto...

3821
02:56:01,640 --> 02:56:03,280
Minto is never allowed to have a gun.

3822
02:56:03,380 --> 02:56:03,620
Why?

3823
02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:06,720
Let Minto have her gun!

3824
02:56:06,880 --> 02:56:08,460
Let me have my gun, please!

3825
02:56:09,380 --> 02:56:10,640
Oh my gosh, I cannot...

3826
02:56:11,080 --> 02:56:12,020
Put this down.

3827
02:56:12,020 --> 02:56:12,720
There we go.

3828
02:56:12,780 --> 02:56:13,160
There we go!

3829
02:56:13,480 --> 02:56:13,940
Okay.

3830
02:56:14,320 --> 02:56:14,780
Easy.

3831
02:56:14,960 --> 02:56:15,320
Easy.

3832
02:56:15,740 --> 02:56:16,200
Push.

3833
02:56:17,120 --> 02:56:17,580
Yay!

3834
02:56:22,660 --> 02:56:23,580
Our traffic!

3835
02:56:28,530 --> 02:56:29,310
Danger zone!

3836
02:56:30,830 --> 02:56:32,630
Our danger zone stopper!

3837
02:56:33,030 --> 02:56:33,610
Oh wait.

3838
02:56:33,710 --> 02:56:35,050
I think my sign is a little crooked.

3839
02:56:36,570 --> 02:56:37,210
There we go.

3840
02:56:37,310 --> 02:56:38,030
I fixed it.

3841
02:56:59,800 --> 02:57:00,260
Shh!

3842
02:57:00,360 --> 02:57:00,700
Shh!

3843
02:57:00,820 --> 02:57:01,080
Shh!

3844
02:57:01,160 --> 02:57:01,400
Shh!

3845
02:57:01,400 --> 02:57:01,820
Shh!

3846
02:57:02,060 --> 02:57:02,260
Shh!

3847
02:57:02,280 --> 02:57:02,420
Shh!

3848
02:57:07,580 --> 02:57:08,880
Don't touch it.

3849
02:57:10,140 --> 02:57:11,520
Don't touch it.

3850
02:57:13,190 --> 02:57:15,940
I was just trying to push it down so it would...

3851
02:57:15,940 --> 02:57:16,940
You know...

3852
02:57:16,940 --> 02:57:19,100
Oh god, this one's not dry either.

3853
02:57:20,090 --> 02:57:22,480
Guys, we are in trouble.

3854
02:57:23,340 --> 02:57:27,420
Okay I gotta let it dry for 24 hours probably.

3855
02:57:28,180 --> 02:57:33,280
Is the rate of dry it needs to do.

3856
02:57:33,540 --> 02:57:34,200
Probably.

3857
02:57:35,600 --> 02:57:36,320
Okay.

3858
02:57:36,320 --> 02:57:37,040
Yay!

3859
02:57:37,460 --> 02:57:39,260
That looks more straight.

3860
02:57:46,450 --> 02:57:47,890
That looks better.

3861
02:57:48,290 --> 02:57:49,530
That looks better.

3862
02:57:49,750 --> 02:57:50,890
That looks better.

3863
02:57:51,250 --> 02:57:51,970
Okay.

3864
02:57:53,410 --> 02:57:55,970
We only had a few incidents today.

3865
02:57:57,470 --> 02:57:58,550
This breaking.

3866
02:58:01,970 --> 02:58:04,730
Losing that one piece.

3867
02:58:06,670 --> 02:58:11,030
But other than that, look at all this that we've completed as well.

3868
02:58:11,210 --> 02:58:15,750
Our 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

3869
02:58:16,430 --> 02:58:17,590
8 items.

3870
02:58:19,310 --> 02:58:20,630
Vivian, welcome to membership.

3871
02:58:20,650 --> 02:58:21,270
Thank you.

3872
02:58:21,970 --> 02:58:22,990
Oh, and my chair.

3873
02:58:23,130 --> 02:58:25,490
Yes, I did break my chair as well.

3874
02:58:26,350 --> 02:58:28,230
Now we're on 7.

3875
02:58:29,370 --> 02:58:31,610
When do we... Oh, number 8.

3876
02:58:31,630 --> 02:58:32,890
We start building the train.

3877
02:58:32,890 --> 02:58:35,310
Oh, wait.

3878
02:58:35,450 --> 02:58:36,030
That's F1.

3879
02:58:37,410 --> 02:58:38,130
Uh-oh.

3880
02:58:38,190 --> 02:58:39,290
I have to find that piece.

3881
02:58:41,530 --> 02:58:44,110
Where does such a massive piece disappear to?

3882
02:58:45,750 --> 02:58:46,430
Oh, wait.

3883
02:58:46,430 --> 02:58:46,550
No.

3884
02:58:46,570 --> 02:58:47,210
That's F15.

3885
02:58:48,110 --> 02:58:49,330
But where did it go?

3886
02:58:52,090 --> 02:58:53,030
I'm at a loss.

3887
02:58:54,130 --> 02:58:54,650
Chocotaku!

3888
02:58:54,950 --> 02:58:56,350
Thank you for the 5.

3889
02:58:56,530 --> 02:58:57,310
Thank you.

3890
02:58:57,510 --> 02:58:58,490
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

3891
02:59:01,030 --> 02:59:01,550
Um...

3892
02:59:05,080 --> 02:59:10,200
Also, I see people donating under the donations.

3893
02:59:10,540 --> 02:59:11,860
I think they're all backlogged.

3894
02:59:12,680 --> 02:59:13,520
Pyrobug, thank you.

3895
02:59:13,600 --> 02:59:14,800
She can't see us all.

3896
02:59:14,960 --> 02:59:15,440
Mintel, cute.

3897
02:59:15,580 --> 02:59:16,300
I see you.

3898
02:59:16,680 --> 02:59:18,060
I saw you.

3899
02:59:19,220 --> 02:59:20,160
Space is ghost.

3900
02:59:20,500 --> 02:59:21,160
Thank you.

3901
02:59:21,600 --> 02:59:22,080
07.

3902
02:59:22,960 --> 02:59:23,980
07, chair-kun.

3903
02:59:24,880 --> 02:59:25,360
07.

3904
02:59:26,260 --> 02:59:27,060
Mino, thank you.

3905
02:59:27,620 --> 02:59:28,740
Chair-fun, thank you.

3906
02:59:29,800 --> 02:59:30,700
Synapse, thank you.

3907
02:59:30,840 --> 02:59:32,540
Herman Minter-fun.

3908
02:59:32,660 --> 02:59:32,940
Hahaha.

3909
02:59:34,240 --> 02:59:35,500
Herman Minter-fun, thank you.

3910
02:59:36,220 --> 02:59:37,160
Ashes, thank you.

3911
02:59:37,500 --> 02:59:38,580
Actual good pizza-fun.

3912
02:59:38,660 --> 02:59:39,000
Let's go.

3913
02:59:39,580 --> 02:59:40,480
Ashes, thanks again.

3914
02:59:40,760 --> 02:59:42,420
Stop eating expired food.

3915
02:59:42,500 --> 02:59:43,460
You can't stop me.

3916
02:59:43,480 --> 02:59:44,260
You're not my mom.

3917
02:59:45,560 --> 02:59:46,700
Dry Princess, thank you.

3918
02:59:47,860 --> 02:59:48,260
Cool.

3919
02:59:49,480 --> 02:59:51,040
Today was quite a day for me.

3920
02:59:51,420 --> 02:59:53,660
Since I set all this up.

3921
02:59:54,280 --> 02:59:57,260
I had to set up the streaming setup.

3922
02:59:57,520 --> 02:59:58,520
And I did VR.

3923
02:59:58,640 --> 02:59:59,860
And I had to set all that up.

3924
02:59:59,900 --> 03:00:01,020
And I had to set up my model.

3925
03:00:02,400 --> 03:00:04,800
I forgot to do some stuff today.

3926
03:00:05,020 --> 03:00:06,180
See you, Blubber.

3927
03:00:06,220 --> 03:00:06,860
Welcome to membership.

3928
03:00:07,100 --> 03:00:07,500
Thank you.

3929
03:00:11,740 --> 03:00:12,700
Really thanks.

3930
03:00:12,920 --> 03:00:15,760
Hope we have a chance to build Rex or some Gunpla someday.

3931
03:00:16,300 --> 03:00:18,300
Well, actually... hold on.

3932
03:00:20,160 --> 03:00:21,060
I have a question.

3933
03:00:21,200 --> 03:00:23,120
For anyone who has done Garage Kits before...

3934
03:00:25,140 --> 03:00:25,760
Uh-oh.

3935
03:00:25,800 --> 03:00:27,180
My chair is acting up again.

3936
03:00:28,360 --> 03:00:28,840
Ugh.

3937
03:00:32,990 --> 03:00:35,350
I got a Garage Kit at WanFest.

3938
03:00:41,060 --> 03:00:42,340
Of a Yume Minamu.

3939
03:00:43,500 --> 03:00:46,080
And it was quite expensive, so I don't want to mess it up.

3940
03:00:46,620 --> 03:00:47,680
Like, look at that.

3941
03:00:48,240 --> 03:00:49,940
One thousand... or...

3942
03:00:51,720 --> 03:00:52,240
Eighteen...

3943
03:00:55,040 --> 03:00:55,560
Ten...

3944
03:00:56,420 --> 03:00:57,880
One eight thousand.

3945
03:00:58,580 --> 03:00:59,700
You did great today.

3946
03:00:59,820 --> 03:01:00,260
Thank you!

3947
03:01:04,890 --> 03:01:05,650
Thank you.

3948
03:01:05,650 --> 03:01:06,850
Is it resin or plastic?

3949
03:01:07,030 --> 03:01:07,990
I think it's pla...

3950
03:01:14,700 --> 03:01:15,220
Dick.

3951
03:01:17,860 --> 03:01:18,900
Yume Minamu.

3952
03:01:20,580 --> 03:01:22,980
Look, it comes with some decals.

3953
03:01:24,340 --> 03:01:25,420
Oops, sorry, my bad.

3954
03:01:25,940 --> 03:01:26,960
They're very cute.

3955
03:01:28,920 --> 03:01:30,400
And then also...

3956
03:01:33,820 --> 03:01:34,340
She.

3957
03:01:37,900 --> 03:01:39,160
Is it the braids?

3958
03:01:39,780 --> 03:01:40,600
The braids?

3959
03:01:41,480 --> 03:01:42,040
The who?

3960
03:01:43,700 --> 03:01:45,020
Do you need to paint it too?

3961
03:01:47,140 --> 03:01:47,620
Yes.

3962
03:01:49,840 --> 03:01:54,660
Do you paint before you put it together or after you put it?

3963
03:01:54,700 --> 03:01:55,680
I think before, right?

3964
03:01:59,160 --> 03:02:00,580
Would be how you do it.

3965
03:02:03,260 --> 03:02:03,740
Look!

3966
03:02:04,220 --> 03:02:07,520
Oh my gosh, even the stand needs to be sanded down.

3967
03:02:07,660 --> 03:02:08,200
I just noticed.

3968
03:02:11,180 --> 03:02:11,620
Me.

3969
03:02:11,760 --> 03:02:15,280
I've never worked with a garage kit ever before in my afterlife.

3970
03:02:15,940 --> 03:02:16,580
Also me.

3971
03:02:17,640 --> 03:02:19,500
Let's buy a really complicated...

3972
03:02:19,500 --> 03:02:21,100
I don't think it's so complicated.

3973
03:02:21,880 --> 03:02:23,640
I wish I could show you what she's...

3974
03:02:23,640 --> 03:02:24,300
Oh, hold on.

3975
03:02:24,460 --> 03:02:25,580
I can show you...

3976
03:02:26,600 --> 03:02:28,500
It's not colored in the picture but...

3977
03:02:28,500 --> 03:02:29,680
She's very cute.

3978
03:02:29,680 --> 03:02:29,780
Cute.

3979
03:02:32,620 --> 03:02:34,240
It could be more complicated.

3980
03:02:34,520 --> 03:02:35,280
Oh, sorry.

3981
03:02:36,320 --> 03:02:38,500
It could be more complicated, I think.

3982
03:02:38,640 --> 03:02:39,020
But...

3983
03:02:39,680 --> 03:02:40,640
That's the design.

3984
03:02:40,680 --> 03:02:43,120
It's the Vocaloid Yume Minamu.

3985
03:02:48,700 --> 03:02:52,220
I know some people take commissions but I don't know any specifically for garage kits.

3986
03:02:52,340 --> 03:02:54,280
I have thought about asking if I should...

3987
03:02:55,340 --> 03:02:56,620
Seeing if I should...

3988
03:02:58,300 --> 03:02:59,080
Hire somebody.

3989
03:02:59,680 --> 03:03:00,540
Or at least...

3990
03:03:00,540 --> 03:03:02,600
Someone who can mentor me through it.

3991
03:03:02,920 --> 03:03:05,680
I'm especially concerned about the decals because...

3992
03:03:06,700 --> 03:03:08,240
I don't want to mess them up.

3993
03:03:08,540 --> 03:03:10,520
You only get one set, you know?

3994
03:03:14,420 --> 03:03:16,440
You need glue and putty.

3995
03:03:17,400 --> 03:03:17,960
Yeah.

3996
03:03:24,370 --> 03:03:24,930
Mentor.

3997
03:03:27,830 --> 03:03:29,170
Painting this would be tough.

3998
03:03:29,510 --> 03:03:30,250
You think so?

3999
03:03:32,070 --> 03:03:34,090
But it's like one step at a time, right?

4000
03:03:34,750 --> 03:03:36,450
And the colors are pretty basic.

4001
03:03:36,990 --> 03:03:39,450
I don't think there's like any gradients or...

4002
03:03:40,030 --> 03:03:42,190
Anything like that from what I can remember.

4003
03:03:44,030 --> 03:03:46,570
It's like all bunch of solid colors, so...

4004
03:03:47,570 --> 03:03:48,090
Hmm...

4005
03:03:51,430 --> 03:03:53,870
But I'm also concerned that...

4006
03:03:54,710 --> 03:03:56,530
Some of these pieces need to be...

4007
03:03:58,390 --> 03:03:59,870
Filed, sanded and stuff.

4008
03:04:02,490 --> 03:04:03,050
Hmm...

4009
03:04:05,090 --> 03:04:05,650
Hmmmm...

4010
03:04:05,650 --> 03:04:06,570
Hmm...

4011
03:04:06,570 --> 03:04:07,310
Maybe I should have...

4012
03:04:08,690 --> 03:04:09,750
Maybe I should...

4013
03:04:10,350 --> 03:04:10,950
Hire somebody.

4014
03:04:12,350 --> 03:04:14,750
I think I should hire someone...

4015
03:04:15,610 --> 03:04:17,410
Some of these pieces...

4016
03:04:17,410 --> 03:04:18,670
Are like kind of...

4017
03:04:18,670 --> 03:04:20,630
It's really satisfying to listen to though.

4018
03:04:20,730 --> 03:04:21,190
Hold on...

4019
03:05:11,950 --> 03:05:14,910
Okay, I probably shouldn't rub these all together because I don't want them...

4020
03:05:14,910 --> 03:05:15,710
To like...

4021
03:05:15,710 --> 03:05:16,930
Break apart in there.

4022
03:05:17,110 --> 03:05:17,470
Hahaha!

4023
03:05:19,490 --> 03:05:20,050
hahaha!

4024
03:05:20,050 --> 03:05:21,130
I don't want to break them apart in there.

4025
03:05:21,930 --> 03:05:22,290
Okay.

4026
03:05:30,900 --> 03:05:33,040
Yeah, I got it at WandFest.

4027
03:05:33,140 --> 03:05:33,340
See?

4028
03:05:34,600 --> 03:05:34,960
Wonder...

4029
03:05:37,940 --> 03:05:39,220
WonderFestival... Oh, you can't read it at all.

4030
03:05:40,520 --> 03:05:41,300
Gosh, this webcam!

4031
03:05:42,220 --> 03:05:42,720
Oh well.

4032
03:05:44,140 --> 03:05:45,360
So yeah, I have that.

4033
03:05:46,120 --> 03:05:47,560
That I've been like, wanting to...

4034
03:05:49,060 --> 03:05:49,960
Wanting to put together.

4035
03:05:53,920 --> 03:05:55,560
There's another WandFest at the end of this month.

4036
03:05:55,560 --> 03:05:58,960
There's a WandFest... I feel like there's more WandFest's than...

4037
03:05:59,560 --> 03:06:00,080
Than...

4038
03:06:02,360 --> 03:06:04,100
Like Comikets and stuff.

4039
03:06:05,760 --> 03:06:06,380
But...

4040
03:06:09,080 --> 03:06:10,640
What was I gonna say?

4041
03:06:15,540 --> 03:06:16,160
Oh!

4042
03:06:16,160 --> 03:06:16,780
There!

4043
03:06:17,180 --> 03:06:19,380
At the WandFest though...

4044
03:06:20,540 --> 03:06:22,480
Actually, it was so crazy.

4045
03:06:22,600 --> 03:06:23,700
I was just wandering around.

4046
03:06:23,980 --> 03:06:25,420
I was just looking around.

4047
03:06:25,560 --> 03:06:25,880
And stuff.

4048
03:06:26,240 --> 03:06:26,880
And...

4049
03:06:27,560 --> 03:06:28,680
Going to one area.

4050
03:06:29,840 --> 03:06:31,100
Where they had...

4051
03:06:31,100 --> 03:06:32,620
Like the more industry places.

4052
03:06:33,100 --> 03:06:34,660
Industry booths and stuff.

4053
03:06:34,940 --> 03:06:37,280
And the singer for...

4054
03:06:37,280 --> 03:06:39,700
Cruel Angel's Thesis was just performing.

4055
03:06:40,240 --> 03:06:47,120
I got to hear the singer, the original singer of Cruel Angel's Thesis was Takahashi Yoko?

4056
03:06:49,360 --> 03:06:50,980
Sing Cruel Angel's Thesis.

4057
03:06:51,340 --> 03:06:52,460
Just randomly.

4058
03:06:53,120 --> 03:06:53,760
Crazy.

4059
03:06:57,600 --> 03:06:58,520
That was so crazy.

4060
03:06:58,560 --> 03:06:59,320
I just walked up.

4061
03:06:59,420 --> 03:07:01,300
I was like, what's going on you?

4062
03:07:02,240 --> 03:07:02,760
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

4063
03:07:07,400 --> 03:07:08,020
Takahashi Yoko.

4064
03:07:08,140 --> 03:07:08,820
Okay, I was right.

4065
03:07:10,260 --> 03:07:12,980
I thought my weeb card was about to be revoked there.

4066
03:07:15,260 --> 03:07:20,200
I thought I was about to have to get my weeb card revoked for getting the name incorrectly.

4067
03:07:22,480 --> 03:07:22,880
Yeah.

4068
03:07:23,740 --> 03:07:24,140
Ugh.

4069
03:07:29,890 --> 03:07:31,890
To answer some messages from earlier.

4070
03:07:32,150 --> 03:07:33,010
Oh, these are not made...

4071
03:07:33,010 --> 03:07:34,250
Oh, were other people confused?

4072
03:07:34,490 --> 03:07:38,150
Oh yeah, so a garage kit is basically like what Yoshi is saying.

4073
03:07:38,310 --> 03:07:38,650
Like...

4074
03:07:39,310 --> 03:07:39,570
They're...

4075
03:07:39,570 --> 03:07:43,070
They're fan made.

4076
03:07:43,350 --> 03:07:44,850
So they're very...

4077
03:07:44,850 --> 03:07:46,610
They can be very rough around the edges.

4078
03:07:47,950 --> 03:07:48,470
And...

4079
03:07:50,150 --> 03:07:51,190
They are...

4080
03:07:51,190 --> 03:07:51,910
Like...

4081
03:07:53,230 --> 03:07:53,750
Not...

4082
03:07:53,750 --> 03:07:55,830
They're not painted usually.

4083
03:07:56,030 --> 03:07:57,670
They're not assembled usually.

4084
03:07:57,890 --> 03:07:59,170
Like you have to do everything yourself.

4085
03:07:59,970 --> 03:08:01,430
So, it's a little...

4086
03:08:01,430 --> 03:08:03,650
Like a DIY stuff, you know.

4087
03:08:04,770 --> 03:08:05,510
Indie figures.

4088
03:08:05,610 --> 03:08:06,110
Exactly!

4089
03:08:06,350 --> 03:08:07,270
That's what it is though.

4090
03:08:08,050 --> 03:08:08,550
Yeah.

4091
03:08:10,370 --> 03:08:10,870
And...

4092
03:08:10,870 --> 03:08:13,790
But you can find them like so...

4093
03:08:13,790 --> 03:08:16,710
Like there was one blue archive one I almost got.

4094
03:08:16,890 --> 03:08:19,710
Cause I thought that they were pre-painted but just needed to be assembled.

4095
03:08:19,990 --> 03:08:21,710
But it wasn't.

4096
03:08:21,710 --> 03:08:25,090
It was like a Rona and Plata and swimsuits and they were...

4097
03:08:25,660 --> 03:08:27,690
They were so cute!

4098
03:08:28,190 --> 03:08:28,610
Ah!

4099
03:08:31,510 --> 03:08:32,430
But yeah...

4100
03:08:35,730 --> 03:08:36,650
You know...

4101
03:08:37,790 --> 03:08:39,150
I never... That was the...

4102
03:08:39,150 --> 03:08:40,950
That's actually the first garage kit I've ever bought.

4103
03:08:41,030 --> 03:08:41,870
Because I...

4104
03:08:43,370 --> 03:08:44,750
I don't do painting.

4105
03:08:44,890 --> 03:08:46,150
So I was just like...

4106
03:08:47,370 --> 03:08:48,730
I saw one of those.

4107
03:08:48,770 --> 03:08:48,910
Yeah!

4108
03:08:49,030 --> 03:08:50,210
I saw two of them!

4109
03:08:50,330 --> 03:08:52,290
There was one that I was just like...

4110
03:08:55,510 --> 03:08:56,470
Cute until...

4111
03:08:56,470 --> 03:08:58,250
When you need to assemble and paint.

4112
03:08:58,430 --> 03:08:58,850
I know!

4113
03:08:58,990 --> 03:09:01,770
And they make it look so good in the pictures!

4114
03:09:07,060 --> 03:09:09,100
I think I will hire somebody though.

4115
03:09:10,520 --> 03:09:11,000
Somewhere.

4116
03:09:11,180 --> 03:09:11,660
Somehow.

4117
03:09:11,980 --> 03:09:15,680
Wherever I can find somebody who does garage kit painting.

4118
03:09:16,180 --> 03:09:17,360
I don't know if I...

4119
03:09:17,360 --> 03:09:19,120
Like you know... I could probably find...

4120
03:09:19,120 --> 03:09:23,280
I mean not probably but I could find somebody who does like miniature paintings and things like that.

4121
03:09:23,320 --> 03:09:25,100
But I think it's a little...

4122
03:09:25,400 --> 03:09:25,880
Different.

4123
03:09:26,660 --> 03:09:27,080
So...

4124
03:09:27,520 --> 03:09:27,940
Hmm...

4125
03:09:30,600 --> 03:09:31,740
A lot of prep required?

4126
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:33,000
I built garage kits before.

4127
03:09:33,160 --> 03:09:33,420
Oh yeah!

4128
03:09:33,540 --> 03:09:34,880
And I don't have an airbrush!

4129
03:09:35,180 --> 03:09:36,480
Which I feel would be...

4130
03:09:38,020 --> 03:09:38,440
Um...

4131
03:09:39,140 --> 03:09:40,620
Which I feel would be...

4132
03:09:42,140 --> 03:09:44,760
It will lower the quality I feel, you know?

4133
03:09:46,920 --> 03:09:48,380
It's a damn fine figure.

4134
03:09:48,480 --> 03:09:49,880
Why the hell does mine look like that?

4135
03:09:49,960 --> 03:09:50,300
I know!

4136
03:09:50,500 --> 03:09:51,760
I would be like...

4137
03:09:51,760 --> 03:09:52,300
No!

4138
03:09:53,660 --> 03:09:55,060
I would be like... No!

4139
03:09:55,400 --> 03:09:56,840
Mine turned out so ugly!

4140
03:09:57,160 --> 03:09:58,000
And I got it!

4141
03:09:58,040 --> 03:09:59,240
And it was so expensive!

4142
03:09:59,480 --> 03:10:02,300
And I love this character so I wanted to look good!

4143
03:10:04,380 --> 03:10:05,500
But yeah...

4144
03:10:06,200 --> 03:10:08,960
You and Matara need to paint Warhammer minis.

4145
03:10:10,240 --> 03:10:11,360
Oh yeah...

4146
03:10:13,080 --> 03:10:13,820
I know!

4147
03:10:13,920 --> 03:10:21,240
When we were recording the Warhammer episode for the Patreon which comes out this coming Monday...

4148
03:10:22,060 --> 03:10:22,620
Um...

4149
03:10:23,760 --> 03:10:25,260
Uh... I was like...

4150
03:10:25,400 --> 03:10:26,740
They're tiny!

4151
03:10:27,840 --> 03:10:29,720
They're teeny teeny tiny!

4152
03:10:30,780 --> 03:10:34,040
But I've watched painting videos before.

4153
03:10:34,300 --> 03:10:48,660
Like how you do the... Like why I say it's kind of different I feel like to the garage kit I have is because like to do the shadows and stuff you can like paint the black and then paint over it and it kind of like does that layering effect and stuff like that.

4154
03:10:50,160 --> 03:10:51,120
But um...

4155
03:10:52,760 --> 03:10:55,180
I recently finished B.A.'s final episode.

4156
03:11:01,640 --> 03:11:03,740
With Shiroko it's so emo-y.

4157
03:11:05,880 --> 03:11:06,440
Hmm...

4158
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:08,960
But yeah...

4159
03:11:08,960 --> 03:11:10,160
You can use inks for that too.

4160
03:11:10,300 --> 03:11:10,600
Oh really?

4161
03:11:11,420 --> 03:11:13,540
They're pretty different from garage kit painting.

4162
03:11:13,820 --> 03:11:14,340
Yeah...

4163
03:11:14,980 --> 03:11:16,360
Cole you probably... wait...

4164
03:11:18,180 --> 03:11:19,380
You make figures!

4165
03:11:20,220 --> 03:11:22,340
Have you ever done garage kit painting?

4166
03:11:23,480 --> 03:11:26,420
You had to paint the figures you've made right?

4167
03:11:26,680 --> 03:11:27,240
So...

4168
03:11:31,340 --> 03:11:32,100
Oh...

4169
03:11:34,020 --> 03:11:36,040
Aru steals the show in the anime?

4170
03:11:36,840 --> 03:11:40,280
Well that's because also... I mean yeah she's so cute.

4171
03:11:40,640 --> 03:11:41,660
But uh...

4172
03:11:41,660 --> 03:11:44,460
They um...

4173
03:11:45,020 --> 03:11:46,160
Focused on...

4174
03:11:47,020 --> 03:11:48,140
On them.

4175
03:11:48,680 --> 03:11:49,940
What's their um...

4176
03:11:50,920 --> 03:11:53,140
Problem solvers 68?

4177
03:11:54,780 --> 03:11:55,160
67?

4178
03:11:55,500 --> 03:11:56,120
66?

4179
03:11:56,240 --> 03:11:56,580
65?

4180
03:11:57,040 --> 03:12:00,240
As a painter of tabletop minis it's rough but sometimes it's rewarding.

4181
03:12:02,700 --> 03:12:03,260
Yeah...

4182
03:12:03,260 --> 03:12:05,740
I can imagine with the mini is it's like so much patience.

4183
03:12:06,820 --> 03:12:10,740
But also probably with those you would assemble them first right?

4184
03:12:11,600 --> 03:12:16,420
Because I feel like the parts are too many to paint before you assemble it.

4185
03:12:16,720 --> 03:12:18,580
They were like this big!

4186
03:12:20,180 --> 03:12:20,740
69?

4187
03:12:27,440 --> 03:12:28,380
Depends on the mini.

4188
03:12:32,180 --> 03:12:32,740
Depends on the mini.

4189
03:12:32,740 --> 03:12:33,940
Sometimes you paint before assembly.

4190
03:12:37,170 --> 03:12:38,330
So much patience.

4191
03:12:38,770 --> 03:12:40,150
So much patience.

4192
03:12:40,150 --> 03:12:40,210
Too much patience.

4193
03:12:48,920 --> 03:12:50,840
My tea has gone cold.

4194
03:12:53,900 --> 03:12:55,660
My tea has gone cold.

4195
03:12:55,760 --> 03:12:56,240
My tea has gone cold.

4196
03:12:56,240 --> 03:12:56,640
So sad.

4197
03:13:02,040 --> 03:13:02,620
No!

4198
03:13:03,300 --> 03:13:04,520
It's been a few hours.

4199
03:13:04,700 --> 03:13:06,520
Wait how long have I been streaming for?

4200
03:13:08,560 --> 03:13:09,620
3 hours!

4201
03:13:10,100 --> 03:13:10,260
3 hours!

4202
03:13:11,680 --> 03:13:12,340
I'm tired.

4203
03:13:12,640 --> 03:13:13,800
Is it okay if I go to sleep?

4204
03:13:14,540 --> 03:13:15,480
Well not sleep.

4205
03:13:15,600 --> 03:13:16,960
I have some stuff I need to work on.

4206
03:13:17,040 --> 03:13:18,380
That I didn't get to work on today.

4207
03:13:18,560 --> 03:13:21,060
Because I was too busy setting up for this stream.

4208
03:13:21,220 --> 03:13:23,080
And setting up for this stream earlier.

4209
03:13:25,480 --> 03:13:26,600
I gotta respond.

4210
03:13:26,760 --> 03:13:30,200
I have a whole list of things of me being like reply to this email.

4211
03:13:30,480 --> 03:13:31,600
Reply to this email.

4212
03:13:31,840 --> 03:13:32,900
Reply to this email.

4213
03:13:41,300 --> 03:13:43,120
I gotta send my address.

4214
03:13:43,340 --> 03:13:46,040
They're gonna ship me a sample of my product!

4215
03:13:47,240 --> 03:13:47,920
Yippee!

4216
03:13:48,980 --> 03:13:50,560
Next week is my...

4217
03:13:50,560 --> 03:13:52,120
You guys next week is my anniversary.

4218
03:13:52,880 --> 03:13:54,020
Next week...

4219
03:13:54,020 --> 03:13:56,160
I'm finally able to celebrate...

4220
03:13:56,160 --> 03:13:58,280
My first year anniversary.

4221
03:14:00,620 --> 03:14:02,060
I graduated...

4222
03:14:02,060 --> 03:14:04,820
I graduated before I...

4223
03:14:04,820 --> 03:14:06,360
Before I got to celebrate.

4224
03:14:08,380 --> 03:14:09,500
And now...

4225
03:14:09,500 --> 03:14:11,140
I get to celebrate my...

4226
03:14:11,140 --> 03:14:12,700
First year anniversary.

4227
03:14:14,520 --> 03:14:15,620
Even though it's...

4228
03:14:15,620 --> 03:14:17,080
My four year anniversary.

4229
03:14:18,080 --> 03:14:19,200
First year...

4230
03:14:19,920 --> 03:14:22,040
I think because it's my first time celebrating.

4231
03:14:22,960 --> 03:14:25,300
Maybe I can say it's my first year anniversary.

4232
03:14:27,020 --> 03:14:28,420
Maybe I can say it's my first year anniversary.

4233
03:14:28,420 --> 03:14:28,440
Maybe I can say it's my first year anniversary.

4234
03:14:29,240 --> 03:14:30,160
I'll be honest.

4235
03:14:30,940 --> 03:14:32,480
I don't have so much planned.

4236
03:14:33,200 --> 03:14:33,760
Because...

4237
03:14:34,460 --> 03:14:35,020
I...

4238
03:14:38,200 --> 03:14:38,840
I...

4239
03:14:38,840 --> 03:14:40,120
I don't have so much planned.

4240
03:14:41,820 --> 03:14:42,460
But...

4241
03:14:43,180 --> 03:14:43,820
Um...

4242
03:14:44,980 --> 03:14:46,560
Mint 1.0 debut...

4243
03:14:46,560 --> 03:14:47,220
Watch along...

4244
03:14:47,220 --> 03:14:48,140
Oh my gosh.

4245
03:14:49,220 --> 03:14:50,540
That would be wild.

4246
03:14:51,300 --> 03:14:53,120
I feel like usually...

4247
03:14:53,120 --> 03:14:54,680
For like...

4248
03:14:55,500 --> 03:14:58,540
Say you debuted and then you watch your...

4249
03:14:58,540 --> 03:14:59,860
One year...

4250
03:14:59,860 --> 03:15:02,540
Your debut at your one year anniversary.

4251
03:15:02,720 --> 03:15:04,600
I feel like I remember it.

4252
03:15:04,700 --> 03:15:05,000
You know?

4253
03:15:06,380 --> 03:15:06,980
And this...

4254
03:15:06,980 --> 03:15:08,980
I didn't have a proper debut actually.

4255
03:15:09,080 --> 03:15:10,520
I had a video that I put up.

4256
03:15:10,660 --> 03:15:13,580
And then I had like a stream where I answered some questions.

4257
03:15:13,660 --> 03:15:15,800
But even in the stream I didn't like...

4258
03:15:15,800 --> 03:15:17,800
Do a powerpoint or anything like that.

4259
03:15:18,600 --> 03:15:19,120
So...

4260
03:15:20,140 --> 03:15:20,400
Um...

4261
03:15:21,540 --> 03:15:23,360
But yeah I will have some announcements.

4262
03:15:24,060 --> 03:15:24,860
Of stuff.

4263
03:15:26,040 --> 03:15:26,560
Um...

4264
03:15:26,560 --> 03:15:29,540
But probably nothing that...

4265
03:15:29,540 --> 03:15:31,200
I don't know if pre-orders will be up.

4266
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:33,020
For the things.

4267
03:15:33,660 --> 03:15:36,560
Pre-orders will probably be up more towards...

4268
03:15:36,560 --> 03:15:37,000
August.

4269
03:15:39,680 --> 03:15:42,000
And then I hope you'll be patient with me.

4270
03:15:42,780 --> 03:15:43,420
Um...

4271
03:15:43,420 --> 03:15:44,640
For...

4272
03:15:45,500 --> 03:15:46,940
Shipping stuff as well.

4273
03:15:49,160 --> 03:15:49,800
Um...

4274
03:15:49,800 --> 03:15:50,720
But...

4275
03:15:50,720 --> 03:15:51,700
Yeah!

4276
03:15:53,520 --> 03:15:54,960
I have some stuff.

4277
03:15:56,180 --> 03:15:56,820
MSN!

4278
03:15:56,820 --> 03:15:58,600
Thank you for the super chat!

4279
03:15:59,260 --> 03:16:00,100
Thank you!

4280
03:16:00,160 --> 03:16:01,300
Thank you!

4281
03:16:04,200 --> 03:16:04,720
Oh!

4282
03:16:06,100 --> 03:16:07,140
In the Mei Cafe.

4283
03:16:07,280 --> 03:16:08,320
Straight up kissing it.

4284
03:16:09,380 --> 03:16:10,480
Wait that's old.

4285
03:16:10,880 --> 03:16:11,340
Hahaha.

4286
03:16:12,980 --> 03:16:13,740
That's old.

4287
03:16:14,120 --> 03:16:15,180
By it haha.

4288
03:16:15,440 --> 03:16:16,300
Well let's just say...

4289
03:16:16,300 --> 03:16:17,400
My Sakura Densha.

4290
03:16:18,280 --> 03:16:19,660
Shut up Ducky.

4291
03:16:19,940 --> 03:16:20,460
Hahaha.

4292
03:16:22,760 --> 03:16:24,340
Also I saw that spank.

4293
03:16:24,960 --> 03:16:26,640
It says she's not looking at these.

4294
03:16:26,680 --> 03:16:27,160
So cute.

4295
03:16:27,560 --> 03:16:29,100
Nah I do look at the donuts.

4296
03:16:30,280 --> 03:16:31,700
That was two hours ago.

4297
03:16:33,100 --> 03:16:33,840
You're right.

4298
03:16:33,960 --> 03:16:35,360
It was two hours ago.

4299
03:16:40,060 --> 03:16:42,140
It was relevant at the time.

4300
03:16:42,760 --> 03:16:44,700
I still would have told you to shut up.

4301
03:16:45,180 --> 03:16:45,700
Hahaha.

4302
03:16:47,620 --> 03:16:48,140
Um...

4303
03:16:48,140 --> 03:16:50,540
But yeah I have some fun stuff to announce.

4304
03:16:51,600 --> 03:16:52,120
Um...

4305
03:16:52,120 --> 03:16:52,660
Thank you!

4306
03:16:52,900 --> 03:16:53,120
Thank you!

4307
03:16:53,400 --> 03:16:53,800
Kiss!

4308
03:16:54,200 --> 03:16:54,720
Kiss!

4309
03:16:58,440 --> 03:17:01,520
I feel like I'll have more things to announce.

4310
03:17:01,520 --> 03:17:03,520
Maybe more towards my birthday.

4311
03:17:03,960 --> 03:17:04,080
Maybe more towards my birthday.

4312
03:17:05,860 --> 03:17:07,600
But that's a while from now.

4313
03:17:10,780 --> 03:17:12,700
The gifted memberships lag it so much.

4314
03:17:12,700 --> 03:17:13,440
I know right?

4315
03:17:13,660 --> 03:17:15,400
I wish there was a way to turn it off.

4316
03:17:15,600 --> 03:17:17,220
Well not turn off like...

4317
03:17:17,940 --> 03:17:20,640
Turn off the notif from clogging it up.

4318
03:17:20,740 --> 03:17:21,120
Turn off the notif from clogging it up.

4319
03:17:21,120 --> 03:17:23,140
Luckily I found a way so that it's not just...

4320
03:17:23,140 --> 03:17:26,200
Notif after notif after notif after notif after notif.

4321
03:17:27,880 --> 03:17:28,820
But um...

4322
03:17:29,760 --> 03:17:30,280
October?

4323
03:17:30,480 --> 03:17:31,600
I think will be...

4324
03:17:31,600 --> 03:17:32,860
My month.

4325
03:17:34,320 --> 03:17:36,560
It is my month because I'm a ghost.

4326
03:17:36,840 --> 03:17:38,700
Anyway, it's a spooky month.

4327
03:17:39,140 --> 03:17:40,940
I started fostering a cat today!

4328
03:17:41,460 --> 03:17:42,340
Any tips?

4329
03:17:42,860 --> 03:17:44,260
Wait is your first cat ever?

4330
03:17:46,320 --> 03:17:48,820
If you're fostering it, are you fostering to adopt?

4331
03:17:48,940 --> 03:17:51,900
Are you fostering so that they get adopted by someone else?

4332
03:17:52,280 --> 03:17:55,780
I don't think I could ever foster to get adopted by someone else.

4333
03:17:55,820 --> 03:17:58,120
Because I'd love the cat too much!

4334
03:17:58,280 --> 03:17:58,800
Because I'd love the cat too much!

4335
03:18:00,400 --> 03:18:01,000
Yeah...

4336
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:02,560
So if you guys just...

4337
03:18:02,560 --> 03:18:03,680
Be...

4338
03:18:03,680 --> 03:18:06,220
A little patient with me until...

4339
03:18:06,220 --> 03:18:07,180
Like October.

4340
03:18:07,420 --> 03:18:09,120
Which I know is quite far away.

4341
03:18:09,220 --> 03:18:11,600
We're mid...

4342
03:18:11,600 --> 03:18:13,900
We're coming up on the end of July already.

4343
03:18:14,040 --> 03:18:14,680
Which is crazy.

4344
03:18:15,140 --> 03:18:16,940
But August, September...

4345
03:18:16,940 --> 03:18:17,940
Two months.

4346
03:18:18,560 --> 03:18:21,840
And then October will be my month.

4347
03:18:22,080 --> 03:18:23,320
Yeah, I think.

4348
03:18:23,660 --> 03:18:24,520
I hope.

4349
03:18:25,260 --> 03:18:26,260
I hope so.

4350
03:18:28,820 --> 03:18:29,300
I hope so.

4351
03:18:32,840 --> 03:18:33,900
I'm praying.

4352
03:18:36,160 --> 03:18:36,700
Yeah.

4353
03:18:37,940 --> 03:18:39,460
So that's stuff.

4354
03:18:39,580 --> 03:18:41,680
That's just some general stuff coming up.

4355
03:18:41,760 --> 03:18:43,000
In the work.

4356
03:18:43,200 --> 03:18:44,040
In the workshops.

4357
03:18:45,280 --> 03:18:45,820
Praising.

4358
03:18:46,040 --> 03:18:48,320
Of course Minto.

4359
03:18:49,600 --> 03:18:51,080
I just dropped that.

4360
03:18:52,160 --> 03:18:53,200
That's gone forever.

4361
03:18:53,360 --> 03:18:53,540
No!

4362
03:18:53,680 --> 03:18:55,240
What else am I supposed to fiddle with?

4363
03:18:58,820 --> 03:18:59,340
My scissors.

4364
03:19:11,670 --> 03:19:12,190
So...

4365
03:19:13,210 --> 03:19:13,730
Yeah.

4366
03:19:14,690 --> 03:19:15,870
Don't play with scissors.

4367
03:19:16,870 --> 03:19:18,590
Don't play with scissors children!

4368
03:19:21,010 --> 03:19:21,530
Um...

4369
03:19:23,370 --> 03:19:23,890
Yeah.

4370
03:19:24,790 --> 03:19:26,170
I don't think...

4371
03:19:26,870 --> 03:19:27,390
Sorry.

4372
03:19:27,570 --> 03:19:28,190
I was like...

4373
03:19:28,190 --> 03:19:29,610
I don't think I have any other updates.

4374
03:19:29,750 --> 03:19:30,510
Announcement stuff.

4375
03:19:30,750 --> 03:19:35,290
I didn't realize that this...

4376
03:19:35,290 --> 03:19:37,970
I didn't mean for this to turn into an announcement thing.

4377
03:19:42,820 --> 03:19:43,600
Scissors ASMR.

4378
03:19:46,360 --> 03:19:47,180
Minto hands.

4379
03:19:47,500 --> 03:19:48,720
Aren't he a ghost?

4380
03:19:48,920 --> 03:19:50,160
I just got here.

4381
03:19:50,360 --> 03:19:51,540
That's why I have the gloves on.

4382
03:19:52,220 --> 03:19:52,740
Otherwise...

4383
03:19:52,740 --> 03:19:53,700
I'm...

4384
03:19:55,920 --> 03:19:56,440
I'm...

4385
03:19:56,980 --> 03:19:58,320
Watch, watch.

4386
03:19:58,400 --> 03:19:59,040
It'll go through it.

4387
03:20:02,280 --> 03:20:03,760
It goes through my hand.

4388
03:20:04,380 --> 03:20:05,100
It goes through my hand.

4389
03:20:11,140 --> 03:20:11,760
It goes through my hand.

4390
03:20:11,760 --> 03:20:11,900
You see?

4391
03:20:11,900 --> 03:20:11,980
You see?

4392
03:20:14,780 --> 03:20:15,600
You see?

4393
03:20:17,460 --> 03:20:18,440
New announcement.

4394
03:20:18,620 --> 03:20:19,140
Minto cute.

4395
03:20:20,360 --> 03:20:21,640
You say that again.

4396
03:20:21,860 --> 03:20:23,240
You say that again.

4397
03:20:23,320 --> 03:20:24,560
You say that again.

4398
03:20:26,860 --> 03:20:28,060
That wasn't a threat.

4399
03:20:28,440 --> 03:20:29,660
It was a promise.

4400
03:20:37,990 --> 03:20:40,110
Just goes straight through my hand.

4401
03:20:42,650 --> 03:20:43,250
See?

4402
03:20:44,790 --> 03:20:46,430
It goes straight through my hand.

4403
03:20:47,350 --> 03:20:47,950
Threatening.

4404
03:20:47,970 --> 03:20:49,110
Threatening with flowery scissors.

4405
03:20:49,410 --> 03:20:50,090
Shut up.

4406
03:20:55,330 --> 03:20:57,070
You know who I am, boop.

4407
03:20:58,290 --> 03:20:59,370
I do know actually.

4408
03:21:02,110 --> 03:21:03,170
How is Sensei doing?

4409
03:21:03,230 --> 03:21:03,790
Covered in glue?

4410
03:21:04,290 --> 03:21:05,330
Sensei is all...

4411
03:21:06,570 --> 03:21:07,150
Sealed up.

4412
03:21:08,670 --> 03:21:09,850
I hope there's no glue.

4413
03:21:09,950 --> 03:21:11,430
If so, I'm gonna have to lick it off probably.

4414
03:21:12,230 --> 03:21:13,830
No, I think I got all of it.

4415
03:21:14,070 --> 03:21:15,070
I think we're good.

4416
03:21:25,900 --> 03:21:26,940
Sealed away forever.

4417
03:21:30,240 --> 03:21:31,000
Anyways, guys.

4418
03:21:31,100 --> 03:21:31,980
I'm gonna head out.

4419
03:21:32,320 --> 03:21:35,460
You have a wonderful rest of your night.

4420
03:21:35,600 --> 03:21:38,960
I think I probably will work more on this off stream.

4421
03:21:39,140 --> 03:21:39,400
I think I probably will work more on this off stream.

4422
03:21:39,400 --> 03:21:41,140
I don't know if I will stream the rest to be honest.

4423
03:21:41,480 --> 03:21:46,060
But if I do intend on streaming it, I'll get some more done.

4424
03:21:46,380 --> 03:21:50,300
If I don't intend on streaming it, I'll get as much as I can done.

4425
03:21:50,960 --> 03:21:53,480
I'll finish it and I'll take a picture for you guys.

4426
03:21:53,500 --> 03:21:53,620
I'll finish it and I'll take a picture for you guys.

4427
03:21:53,640 --> 03:21:54,500
Obviously.

4428
03:21:57,920 --> 03:21:59,320
Oh, my revolver!

4429
03:21:59,480 --> 03:22:00,060
Yeah, hold on.

4430
03:22:00,240 --> 03:22:01,740
Let me show you my revolver.

4431
03:22:22,150 --> 03:22:24,690
So this is my revolver that I made.

4432
03:22:24,910 --> 03:22:27,870
And it came with these cute little people that I can shoot.

4433
03:22:31,670 --> 03:22:34,170
Oh wait, I don't know where the rubber bands are.

4434
03:22:34,690 --> 03:22:35,490
But um...

4435
03:22:42,360 --> 03:22:43,460
Isn't it so awesome?

4436
03:22:45,400 --> 03:22:48,440
Akiba Man Wars is getting freaky with this mod.

4437
03:22:50,080 --> 03:22:50,700
Yeah.

4438
03:22:51,920 --> 03:22:53,120
Look how beautiful.

4439
03:22:53,560 --> 03:22:56,880
It's the most beautiful weapon ever created.

4440
03:22:59,740 --> 03:23:02,380
I had to like put all these individuals together.

4441
03:23:02,940 --> 03:23:07,660
And then like get it in there with the spinny wheel and everything.

4442
03:23:10,040 --> 03:23:11,240
You're pretty good.

4443
03:23:17,840 --> 03:23:18,380
You're pretty good.

4444
03:23:18,380 --> 03:23:18,460
You're pretty good.

4445
03:23:28,180 --> 03:23:29,260
Six shots.

4446
03:23:31,100 --> 03:23:33,060
Enough to kill anything that moves.

4447
03:23:39,160 --> 03:23:40,840
I've got six shots.

4448
03:23:56,620 --> 03:23:57,660
I'm so organized.

4449
03:23:57,840 --> 03:23:58,460
I'm so organized.

4450
03:23:58,560 --> 03:23:59,120
I'm so organized.

4451
03:24:00,940 --> 03:24:01,740
Look at this.

4452
03:24:01,760 --> 03:24:02,020
Look at this.

4453
03:24:03,060 --> 03:24:04,110
Look at this.

4454
03:24:05,700 --> 03:24:06,540
Feeling lucky.

4455
03:24:07,220 --> 03:24:09,180
Oh my gosh, are we gonna play Russian or what?

4456
03:24:11,560 --> 03:24:14,720
So you like take the rubber band and put it like this.

4457
03:24:17,080 --> 03:24:17,940
And like that.

4458
03:24:19,240 --> 03:24:19,800
I think.

4459
03:24:21,640 --> 03:24:22,520
No you don't.

4460
03:24:23,880 --> 03:24:25,280
I just shot it backwards.

4461
03:24:25,480 --> 03:24:25,680
Hold on.

4462
03:24:29,090 --> 03:24:31,470
You take the rubber band and you put it like this.

4463
03:24:31,470 --> 03:24:31,830
Yes.

4464
03:24:33,630 --> 03:24:34,330
I think.

4465
03:24:36,950 --> 03:24:38,030
Put it like that.

4466
03:24:38,070 --> 03:24:39,230
Like on the front.

4467
03:24:39,730 --> 03:24:40,530
To here.

4468
03:24:40,810 --> 03:24:41,410
You can see it.

4469
03:24:46,980 --> 03:24:48,620
It went so fast.

4470
03:24:48,700 --> 03:24:49,880
You couldn't even see it fly.

4471
03:24:56,790 --> 03:24:57,630
Real gun.

4472
03:25:00,410 --> 03:25:00,930
Yeah.

4473
03:25:00,970 --> 03:25:03,450
So I keep this on my little shelf.

4474
03:25:03,990 --> 03:25:06,010
With all my other Metal Gear stuff.

4475
03:25:06,570 --> 03:25:07,090
With all my other Metal Gear stuff.

4476
03:25:07,470 --> 03:25:08,110
And then...

4477
03:25:08,110 --> 03:25:09,490
Oh it's fun to shoot the people.

4478
03:25:09,750 --> 03:25:10,090
Hold on.

4479
03:25:12,130 --> 03:25:14,230
Don't take that out of context.

4480
03:25:17,510 --> 03:25:19,370
It's fun to shoot the wooden people.

4481
03:25:23,590 --> 03:25:25,590
Would you ever consider collecting airsoft?

4482
03:25:25,770 --> 03:25:26,450
Yes actually.

4483
03:25:26,570 --> 03:25:27,490
I've looked into it.

4484
03:25:29,970 --> 03:25:32,150
I've gone to like airsoft stores in Japan.

4485
03:25:32,490 --> 03:25:34,710
But I'm afraid of bringing them back.

4486
03:25:34,890 --> 03:25:37,450
I haven't gone to an airsoft store in Japan.

4487
03:25:37,470 --> 03:25:38,690
I haven't been in the United States yet.

4488
03:25:39,030 --> 03:25:39,770
Watch this.

4489
03:25:39,910 --> 03:25:40,230
Watch this.

03:25:45,240 --> 03:25:46,200
Ready?

4491
03:25:47,300 --> 03:25:48,260
Aim!

4492
03:25:50,280 --> 03:25:51,240
Ready.

4493
03:25:52,320 --> 03:25:53,280
Steady.

4494
03:25:54,880 --> 03:25:55,800
Friend.

4495
03:25:56,720 --> 03:25:57,680

03:25:58,360 --> 03:25:59,320
Fah!

4497
03:25:59,440 --> 03:25:59,740
Oh.

03:26:00,800 --> 03:26:01,760
Hahahaha.

Steady.

4502
03:26:12,890 --> 03:26:13,230
Hahahaha.

4503
03:26:15,830 --> 03:26:16,570
Friend.

4504
03:26:20,300 --> 03:26:21,040
Friend.

4505
03:26:21,320 --> 03:26:21,620
Oh.

4506
03:26:21,660 --> 03:26:21,880
Wait.

4507
03:27:16,890 --> 03:27:18,030
Confuse your enemy.

4508
03:27:18,030 --> 03:27:20,610
You must first confuse yourself.

4509
03:27:27,620 --> 03:27:29,820
Those engravings on your revolver.

4510
03:27:29,860 --> 03:27:30,280
No.

4511
03:27:30,580 --> 03:27:31,340
They're not.

4512
03:27:31,560 --> 03:27:32,220
No.

4513
03:27:32,280 --> 03:27:32,940
It's just.

4514
03:27:33,600 --> 03:27:35,660
It's not engravings.

4515
03:27:37,540 --> 03:27:39,040
It's not engravings.

4516
03:27:39,860 --> 03:27:40,440
Thank you.

4517
03:27:40,560 --> 03:27:40,560
Thank you.

03:27:40,560 --> 03:27:41,100
You're pretty good.

4519
03:27:46,820 --> 03:27:48,440
I have to work now.

4520
03:27:48,500 --> 03:27:50,060
Can I have a bit of a hand wiggle for the road?

4521
03:27:50,140 --> 03:27:50,620
Here you go.

4522
03:27:50,800 --> 03:27:52,160
