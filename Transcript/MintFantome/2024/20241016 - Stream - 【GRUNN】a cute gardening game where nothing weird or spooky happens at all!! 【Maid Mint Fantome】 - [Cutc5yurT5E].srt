1
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,830
Oh, okay, it works.

2
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,370
It's like, is my... is my mic on?

3
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,010
Hello?

4
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,870
Can you hear me?

5
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,470
Hello?

6
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,790
This is for you, Lilac.

7
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,650
Thank you.

8
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,270
Hello, everybody.

9
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,950
I'm... mint... ish.

10
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,530
I'm mint... ish.

11
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,910
Lilac Mint-chan.

12
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,230
I'm mint.

13
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,090
Hello, hello, hello.

14
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:46,430
I'm back.

15
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,170
Yeah!

16
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,550
Hello.

17
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:51,830
Welcome.

18
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:53,930
Welcome, welcome.

19
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,870
What you...

20
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,790
Groon?

21
00:03:59,210 --> 00:03:59,870
Gran?

22
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,130
You're way cuter than mint is...

23
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:03,990
Hey, wait a second.

24
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,730
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

25
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,830
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

26
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:11,650
Huh?

27
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,770
You don't mean that, right?

28
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,670
So true.

29
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,070
True!

30
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,230
True!

31
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,360
It's... it's literally me!

32
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,440
And you're gonna say that?

33
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,120
What are you talking about?

34
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,360
It's literally me!

35
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,220
You can't just... you can't... you can't just...

36
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,140
You can't just go around to other...

37
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,560
Ghostmates and say that they're cuter.

38
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,180
You can't just do that.

39
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,140
That was a typo.

40
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm seething.

41
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,860
I'm seething.

42
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,240
Wait to reuse my art.

43
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,360
Thank you!

44
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,640
Thank you for the art!

45
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,760
Let's go back.

46
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So we fit the thumbnail.

47
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,860
Last time I used a... I used a Gothamint... Gothamint...

48
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,400
Thumbnail, I was... I was...

49
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,000
It was false advertising, so...

50
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,560
Thank you, mint was cuter.

51
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,000
Truly an upgrade.

52
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,440
Stop!

53
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,300
You would say that.

54
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,220
You're just like purple.

55
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,140
Need all those things to be pink.

56
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,000
You're just so white purple.

57
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,040
It's mint with hair dye.

58
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,820
Anyways, guys, welcome to... to Grun?

59
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,610
Grun?

60
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,080
Not quite sure how it's pronounced.

61
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,200
That is fair.

62
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,660
Welcome to membership.

63
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,360
Thank you!

64
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,240
What if we love both versions?

65
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,920
Then it's a perfect balance.

66
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,960
You have to love the original, like, 1% more.

67
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,160
But this is a Dutch game.

68
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,180
So how's the music?

69
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,680
I hope it's not too loud.

70
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,480
I kind of like it.

71
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,160
It's kind of a vibe.

72
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,080
But maybe... Maybe I should go to the audio.

73
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,340
Maybe it's a little bit down.

74
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,500
Oh, a sound effect.

75
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,180
Actually, hold on.

76
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:03,660
Let's do that.

77
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,560
Let's reduce loud sounds.

78
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,420
That's some fantastic news.

79
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,820
I finally paid off all my student loans.

80
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,260
So take the rest of my money and keep being the best StinkyKo's fan you can be.

81
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,040
Oh my gosh!

82
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,000
Solid as sky!

83
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,120
Congratulations!

84
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,200
Congrats!

85
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,720
You did it!

86
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,360
You're free!

87
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,400
I hope you enjoy the game.

88
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,980
Thank you.

89
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,300
Oh, there's only a few endings.

90
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,720
We'll see how long we play.

91
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,860
How long it takes us to get whatever endings there are.

92
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,360
Leave.

93
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,040
There we go.

94
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,720
Freedom!

95
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,700
Freedom!

96
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,100
Oh my gosh.

97
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,540
I remember... Only because of Vtubing I was able to...

98
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:07,160
I remember when I was able to pay off my ghost student loans.

99
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,000
I was like, wow.

100
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,380
I only have you guys to thank.

101
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,520
Hell yeah, LilacStream.

102
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,300
Hell no, RiceNat in chat.

103
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,230
This is a vinyl guy.

104
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,530
Yes, I got it!

105
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,590
I'm looking... I can look at it right now.

106
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,950
Thank you!

107
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,530
Actually, I have a... I got a record player too.

108
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,690
I just have to set it up.

109
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,550
I haven't set it up yet.

110
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,770
ADK.

111
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,630
Oh gosh.

112
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,550
Good luck.

113
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,330
But I didn't have so much.

114
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,250
I had a couple scholarships.

115
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,710
I was able to go to school early.

116
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,510
My college wasn't so expensive.

117
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,470
Luckily, I didn't have too much.

118
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,630
Inside everyone, there's two mints.

119
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:22,850
Mint and purple mint.

120
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,150
You could say I have a big brain.

121
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,490
You could say my brain is massive.

122
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,610
You could say I'm a smarty pants.

123
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,710
Let's start.

124
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,390
Purple guy?

125
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,850
Is there... wait.

126
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,250
Oh, E to get up.

127
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,410
Oh, there it is.

128
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:56,930
I'm on the bus.

129
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,350
I got a coin.

130
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,150
Always check for your belongings and others as well.

131
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,750
I just saw that you will be at AWA.

132
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,930
I will!

133
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:09,810
I will!

134
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:10,330
I will!

135
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,590
I will.

136
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,250
And that's not the only thing either.

137
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,770
So keep on the lookout for more.

138
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:21,850
Yeah.

139
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,870
I have a scholarly question.

140
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,050
What do you call boobies?

141
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,370
Paranormal entities?

142
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,430
That's so smart.

143
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,390
That's a good one.

144
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,370
Nerd.

145
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,870
Shut the hell up.

146
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,150
Are you not feeling well, mint?

147
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,550
I don't know why my voice is so icky today.

148
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:48,730
Simlish.

149
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,410
Can not make out what he's saying.

150
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,710
Oh my gosh, you guys.

151
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,730
I was ordering...

152
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,030
I was ordering food earlier.

153
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,930
I like called to place an order, which is like huge for me.

154
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,210
But I really wanted this specific food.

155
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,330
And the place also had like a cucumber salad.

156
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,950
And I was like...

157
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,990
I watched actually like a TikTok this morning about a guy that made a cucumber salad.

158
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:19,870
And I was like...

159
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,330
I'm craving some cucumber salad.

160
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,650
And so I asked...

161
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,170
I was like...

162
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,230
What's in the...

163
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,150
What's in the cucumber salad?

164
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,070
And he was like...

165
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,690
You got the...

166
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,310
And you got the...

167
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,690
And I was like...

168
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,050
I think I'll stick with the fried rice.

169
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,940
I was like...

170
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:00,080
I couldn't understand what he said.

171
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,300
He was like...

172
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,060
You got the...

173
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,460
And I was like...

174
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,580
It's okay.

175
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,120
I'll just get what I ordered.

176
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,560
So...

177
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,600
This moment literally happened to me today.

178
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,120
Wow.

179
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,360
Home.

180
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,180
Sweet home.

181
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,760
It's beautiful here.

182
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,420
These roses were planted 60 years ago.

183
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,860
Hag.

184
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,460
Old.

185
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,580
A bridge key.

186
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,020
I don't know what that could be.

187
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,280
Oh.

188
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,080
For the bridge.

189
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,400
Thick.

190
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,040
Welcome to the membership.

191
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,720
Thank you.

192
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,100
Can we swim?

193
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,040
Not quite.

194
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,480
Sorry that my voice is very strange today.

195
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,720
Need a watering can.

196
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,000
Okay.

197
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,020
So we're just a gardener, guys.

198
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,020
Look at us.

199
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,120
Wow.

200
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,040
It's so beautiful.

201
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,220
I heard a loud crack behind me.

202
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,820
What was that?

203
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,120
Plank.

204
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,020
Press tab to view sound for Polaroids.

205
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,800
1 out of 42?

206
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,560
Okay.

207
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,920
We can't leave.

208
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,880
Wait, does that mean...

209
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,920
Just jump.

210
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,600
Wait, there's a guy over there.

211
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,820
And there's a thing there.

212
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,260
Okay.

213
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,820
Garden.

214
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,020
We got the shed.

215
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,340
Why does it say 1B?

216
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,560
You need a trowel for this.

217
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:51,840
Okay.

218
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,840
It is a pretty looking pot.

219
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,660
So I saw someone, a streamer that I like, playing this.

220
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,740
I didn't watch too much because it was interesting, so I wanted to play it myself.

221
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:09,380
But then as I was watching the guy playing it, Matara messaged me.

222
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,760
And she was like, this looks like a game that you would like.

223
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,740
And I was like, I think it's Destiny.

224
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,720
I have to play this.

225
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,080
2B's older sister.

226
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,700
Inspect.

227
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,540
Toilet.

228
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,100
It is an abandoned nest.

229
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,230
But it is...

230
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,140
A little bit spooky, I think.

231
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,980
What's going on here?

232
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,260
What was happening?

233
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,120
I don't think I should...

234
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,300
I think I absorbed it?

235
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,660
Alien abduction?

236
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,040
Maybe?

237
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,680
I think maybe I'm possessed now.

238
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,340
Oh my goodness.

239
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,820
You solved the Polaroid.

240
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,520
Oh, is this the shed?

241
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,740
So the Polaroids, you have to go to these places.

242
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,340
Obtained shears.

243
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,080
Press left mouse button to use the tool.

244
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:17,340
To do, cut the grass, trim all hedges, water the flowers, get rid of molehills, clear all trash.

245
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,100
Why is it...

246
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,360
Creaking and cracking like that.

247
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,820
Oh, we got the toilet key.

248
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,210
And then there's like... You guys are kind of blocking it, but there's like...

249
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,270
Okay.

250
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,430
What the hell is this?

251
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:42,670
Oh.

252
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,470
Dear gardener, please make sure my garden is presentable by Monday.

253
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,670
What day is it?

254
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,210
You are not allowed... Oh, sorry.

255
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,450
You are allowed to take the shears, trowel, and watering can from this shed.

256
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,790
But please note that my house is off limits.

257
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,030
I would also advise you not to wander off during the night.

258
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,170
It gets cold and foggy up here in the north.

259
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,110
It is possible that I require your assistance in something other than the garden later this weekend.

260
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,790
In that case, I will contact you through the phone in the corner.

261
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,090
I expect you are up to the task.

262
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,990
Kind regards, F.H.

263
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:17,730
Postman.

264
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:19,810
Postman nuts.

265
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,690
Nobody is answering.

266
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:23,250
Oh, okay.

267
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,550
This is my bed.

268
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,650
It's too early to sleep.

269
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,730
We're not gonna...

270
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,290
Sleep is for the weak.

271
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,890
I'm a gardener.

272
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,350
Oh my gosh, it's kind of really satisfying.

273
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:43,050
I feel like there would be a much more efficient way to cutting...

274
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,190
than...

275
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,010
with the shears.

276
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,650
Like, how about we invest in technology...

277
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,050
What's this?

278
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:49,850
I missed one.

279
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,070
Magpie!

280
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,450
We saw that.

281
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,150
My favorite streamer, Lilac Phantom.

282
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,550
Beware the mulch?

283
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,710
The mulch.

284
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,050
Rin, welcome to membership.

285
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:03,870
Thank you!

286
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,410
Magpie.

287
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,190
Oh, why is it telling me to run?

288
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,550
I don't like that.

289
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:10,710
Wait, it was a...

290
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,130
Where was the bird's nest?

291
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,910
Oh, over here.

292
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,410
Okay, so we need to get a magpie.

293
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,300
Oh, ow!

294
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,600
I'm kind of blocking it here.

295
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,380
Let me...

296
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,500
Let me move over just a tad.

297
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,960
Because there's like a percentage.

298
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,100
Let me...

299
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,580
Let me scoot you guys down as well.

300
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,020
Oh, it does say Saturday.

301
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,560
So you guys can see the time.

302
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,780
Give me a second.

303
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,340
Scoot you guys down a little.

304
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,360
And we'll do like that maybe.

305
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,190
Hopefully it's not too intrusive.

306
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,860
Beware the mulch.

307
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,380
Oh yeah, wait, hold on.

308
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,200
Let me actually scoot you guys up a little bit now.

309
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,460
Perfect!

310
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,440
Perfect!

311
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,220
Awesome!

312
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,360
What a big old grass plant.

313
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,960
Are these the molehills then maybe?

314
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,420
This is probably AM.

315
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,780
I imagine it'll probably do 24 hour time.

316
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,000
You need a watering can.

317
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,120
Oh, I was looking at the cemetery.

318
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,120
How mysterious.

319
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,980
There's another place to hide in.

320
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,660
It's right next to a cemetery.

321
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,580
I bet she won't beat the game.

322
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,480
What the hell Doki?

323
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,520
Did you play this?

324
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,320
Oh, trim the hedges.

325
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,040
Let's go!

326
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,060
I'm at 20% already Doki.

327
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,420
I'm like way ahead of you.

328
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,920
Look at this.

329
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,900
Oh, there's garbage here.

330
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,220
Clean.

331
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,660
Clean.

332
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,140
Look, I'm like doing way better job than you ever could.

333
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,520
Sometimes I can't tell if the grass is long or not.

334
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,280
Thanks for the really awesome streams.

335
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,020
Thank you Hanna!

336
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,300
Thank you.

337
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,360
Oh, it's locked.

338
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,620
Do I need a watering can?

339
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,980
Well, she said the watering can was in the shed.

340
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,700
But...

341
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,960
It's definitely not in here.

342
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,140
Let's just keep cutting.

343
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,140
We'll go into the bathroom once I'm finished cutting, okay?

344
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,160
And then also the trowel.

345
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,660
You hear the scream of a magpie.

346
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,160
I solved the Polaroid.

347
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,320
There's another one!

348
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,180
Oh my gosh, so when you solve a Polaroid, you get another Polaroid.

349
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,300
Good luck!

350
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,460
Thank you!

351
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,340
Rotten plank.

352
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,220
I guess it wasn't abandoned.

353
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,060
Wait, what is that?

354
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,240
How did he do that?

355
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,340
June 21st, 2001.

356
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,020
Today I made quite some progress on the garden.

357
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,540
At the end of the day, I even got time to explore other parts of town.

358
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,300
Tomorrow I will do something about those dead flowers.

359
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,780
While I think of it, I probably left the watering can in the park.

360
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,960
I should not forget to retrieve that in the morning.

361
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,120
And it is also time to fix that rotten plank in the fence to the backyard.

362
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,020
But for now, I have to head to bed.

363
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,020
It is getting quite dark.

364
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,820
This one?

365
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,160
I see it!

366
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,080
Demolish!

367
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,700
Okay, I am vandalizing my place of work.

368
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:25,800
That's fine.

369
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,800
Don't worry about it, everybody.

370
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,380
Actually, I can't tell what this place needs.

371
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,460
He said the house was not...

372
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,760
He said the house was off limits, you know.

373
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,940
What is this?

374
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,100
Oh, I got a hammer.

375
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,040
Is that blood?

376
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,980
Press Q to cycle through tools.

377
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,940
Okay, interesting.

378
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,660
That's not blood.

379
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,080
Why is it... Why don't I need to tend to the...

380
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,920
Oh wait, maybe I do.

381
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,300
Maybe I was actually cutting it, but I couldn't tell.

382
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,280
Oh, it is a little...

383
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,800
You sense that you do not have to cut the grass here.

384
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,800
I don't care what you tell me right now.

385
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,760
I'm a gardener.

386
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,120
It's my destiny to cut the grass.

387
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,030
Okay.

388
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,510
We have several things.

389
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,270
We first have to cut the grass.

390
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,930
Then, we have to...

391
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,290
Go to the bathroom.

392
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,270
Order of operations, everybody.

393
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,250
It was cutting it, just a little tiny bit, I think.

394
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,430
Is this grass also?

395
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:55,770
Yeah.

396
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,770
Everything gets cut.

397
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,130
Everything gets cut.

398
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,190
What about these tiny little weeds?

399
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,590
And this grass.

400
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:06,610
Okay.

401
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,690
All grass gets cut.

402
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,590
If it's grass, it gets cut.

403
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,690
Do I have to go to the potty now?

404
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,250
Hold!

405
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:16,810
Hold!

406
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:17,730
Hold.

407
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:17,810
Hold.

408
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,830
You must be strong.

409
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,570
Your gardener instinct will carry you through.

410
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,310
Only 34% done!

411
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,290
Wait a second.

412
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,990
Oh, maybe it also includes like...

413
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,930
The other activities that we must do.

414
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,370
Oh, oh wait.

415
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,810
Oh, never mind.

416
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,090
This place is just...

417
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,090
It is a normal garden gnome.

418
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:48,990
Wait.

419
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,130
Look, the grass is all shiny here again.

420
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,710
Can I go through?

421
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,030
Oh, it's locked.

422
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,170
The car!

423
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,450
We did that.

424
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,990
We did that one already though.

425
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,970
This place is so overgrown.

426
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,630
Has no one tended to it in like 50 years?

427
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,150
What happened?

428
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,150
He looks just like you?

429
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,210
I hear a sound.

430
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,790
It's like a...

431
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,320
Just like a crabby.

432
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,260
Okay, this place is actually ginormous.

433
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,840
We have to cut all of this?

434
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,260
In just a few days?

435
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,940
Okay.

436
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,100
One giant blade of grass.

437
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,840
Like I said, maybe we should really invest in a...

438
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,920
An automated lawnmower?

439
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,780
Or...

440
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,800
Anything else?

441
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,140
To make this process...

442
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,680
Less demanding?

443
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,080
Is it him?

444
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,140
Is he speaking to me?

445
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:26,960
Sorry, sir.

446
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,220
I'm above your pay.

447
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,460
Cut that grass like a pro.

448
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,440
I'm a pro!

449
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,020
I'm a pro!

450
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm a pro at cutting grass.

451
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,600
I'm a pro.

452
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,400
Oh, I left one hedge.

453
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,080
I'm so sorry.

454
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,160
For all you freaks out there being like, One single hedge, please!

455
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,300
There's stuff behind the shed.

456
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,520
I feel like this game is gonna be a lot of...

457
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,640
Roaming...

458
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,320
I found a coin!

459
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,440
Dang it, I thought that was...

460
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,960
I know he said something about the...

461
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,780
The watering can being in the park, but for a moment I thought that was it.

462
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,160
Cut the hedge!

463
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,020
Cut the hedge!

464
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,840
Oh, I missed one.

465
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,260
If you see me missing any...

466
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,020
Little bits, just say...

467
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,580
Cut the hedge.

468
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,000
Oh!

469
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,160
I cut all the grass!

470
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,320
Uh, no I did not.

471
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:40,940
Excuse me?

472
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,040
What are my standards?

473
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:44,760
Poopy?

474
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,420
Like, no!

475
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,020
There's literal...

476
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,600
Giant blades.

477
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,660
Okay, let's go back...

478
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,700
To the car.

479
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,660
And then to the bathroom.

480
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,540
I guess it's very forgiving in case you...

481
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,160
Uh...

482
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,630
Okay, I thought it would give me a Polaroid, but nevermind.

483
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,490
Am I gonna have to whack someone?

484
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,150
Am I gonna have to kill?

485
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:17,390
Am I a gardener and a murderer?

486
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,730
Oh, an empty plate.

487
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:24,730
Okay.

488
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,690
And I'm a chef.

489
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,150
Living car!

490
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:29,990
Thanks for the gift!

491
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,490
The house is off limits.

492
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,390
Yes, sir.

493
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,730
Okay, bathroom.

494
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:39,890
Oops.

495
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:41,570
Uh...

496
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,410
Wow!

497
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,530
I just noticed like the tippy top of the church and everything.

498
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,470
This game has like such a...

499
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,510
Cute style.

500
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,850
I like it.

501
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,650
Oh my goodness.

502
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,310
Wait, what?

503
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,230
I don't quite like this ambiance.

504
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,590
Why is there...

505
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,230
I cleared all the trash!

506
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,390
Why is this like a public restroom?

507
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,320
This is not...

508
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,580
You do not see anything in the mirror.

509
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,740
Not even myself?

510
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,820
Am I a vampire?

511
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,020
Garden dome.

512
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,880
What does he have?

513
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,770
What are his secrets?

514
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,640
Wait a second.

515
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,040
Do I?

516
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Oh my god!

517
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:39,980
I'm a murderer?

518
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,440
Gas?

519
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,640
Gas station?

520
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,810
Oh, and I found a coin.

521
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:49,730
Nice.

522
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,110
Alright, so we cut all the grass.

523
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:56,290
We picked up all the trash.

524
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,130
Now we need to get out of here.

525
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,170
I suppose.

526
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,530
But...

527
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:08,770
Our gates are locked, so the only option is going inside the house, I think.

528
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:10,690
Sorry, sir.

529
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,130
I must enter.

530
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:15,410
Because...

531
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:20,110
I have no other option.

532
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,550
What's this?

533
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,790
There is a strange smell coming from this drain.

534
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,410
Garden key.

535
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,520
This tap is dripping a bit.

536
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,890
Did you see it?

537
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,170
Did you see that guy?

538
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,710
Why was he so tall?

539
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,410
It's starting to get dark.

540
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,070
The church.

541
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:07,470
Oh my gosh, and then it says 0% complete.

542
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,950
This area could also use some gardening.

543
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,090
Was I not supposed to cut that?

544
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,270
Wait.

545
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,990
That was really ominous.

546
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,430
Okay, don't touch those flowers.

547
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:22,730
Oh my gosh.

548
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,390
I'll spit.

549
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,670
Thank you so much.

550
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,370
Evil purple Scottish Minto.

551
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,950
Please spit on us.

552
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,640
It is a tombstone.

553
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,600
Here lies...

554
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,040
My career.

555
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,980
I know it said not to stay out after dark, but what if I just keep gardening?

556
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,460
What else is around here?

557
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,920
The bridge to the park is under construction.

558
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,140
And how late is night anyway, right?

559
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,660
Like...

560
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,920
This area right here.

561
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,680
A paddle.

562
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,540
You need a paddle.

563
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,520
I need a paddle to steer this.

564
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,780
I've also noticed there was a D and there's an O over there.

565
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,380
You cannot see the bottom.

566
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,600
Yes, I can.

567
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,720
They're right above me.

568
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,500
You get it, chat?

569
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,560
I just called you a button.

570
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,960
The owls are hooting and hollering.

571
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,700
What's going to happen if I stay out anyway?

572
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:57,940
No one's here to... My mom's not here to tell me to stop doing work.

573
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,620
You show that overgrown garden who's boss, boss.

574
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,700
Oh, something jumped out of the grass.

575
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:05,920
A...

576
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:07,700
Doorknob.

577
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,860
Did we see a door with no handle?

578
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,010
I don't remember seeing one.

579
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,510
It's getting late.

580
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:25,230
It's only...

581
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,330
It's not even 9 PM.

582
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,110
The sun is still up.

583
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,350
Guys, I only have a couple of days.

584
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,830
I've got to get this done.

585
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:34,370
Oh, wait.

586
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,170
One hour?

587
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:37,990
What am I?

588
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,390
Lazy bones over here?

589
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
Panbeon's really...

590
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,540
Just shifted, huh?

591
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,320
If a ghost, a demon...

592
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,000
If a monster, if anyone is trying to get me...

593
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,240
They're gonna see that I'm doing a really great job.

594
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,440
And be like...

595
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,340
I really shouldn't bother that guy.

596
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,680
He's like...

597
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,880
Doing such a great job.

598
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,240
You know?

599
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,460
That's all I have to say about that.

600
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,390
What was that?

601
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,630
What was that sound?

602
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,690
What was that sound?

603
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,090
Maybe I should go back.

604
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,300
Alright.

605
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,280
It's getting dark.

606
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:52,620
Nah.

607
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,740
The sun is still up.

608
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,680
It's still pink.

609
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,780
I'm just...

610
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,440
It's just the ambiance, you know?

611
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,540
It's fine.

612
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,360
It's fine.

613
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,780
It's...

614
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,740
Nevermind.

615
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,360
It's not fine.

616
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,320
It's not fine.

617
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,480
It's not fine.

618
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,320
I

619
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:27,900
know.

620
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,180
Ok, stop working.

621
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:30,960
What happened?

622
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,420
Who are you?

623
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,780
Time to sleep.

624
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,900
I'm sorry.

625
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,460
I'm sorry.

626
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,520
I was out too late.

627
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:49,930
I'm sorry.

628
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,960
Who was at my door?

629
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,120
I'm sorry.

630
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,980
I didn't mean it.

631
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,520
Everything is fine.

632
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,600
The grunt.

633
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,000
Ok, don't cut these guys.

634
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,900
It makes...

635
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,640
It makes them angry.

636
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,060
Is it because I cut the flout?

637
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,440
What do you think?

638
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,420
I love the doves.

639
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,820
The little dove sounds.

640
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,680
Anyway.

641
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,280
Does anyone else live here?

642
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,760
Like...

643
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,540
So we need to get to the park to get the...

644
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,300
The... What is it called?

645
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,460
The watering can.

646
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,760
Church door at midnight.

647
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,100
Alright guys.

648
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,980
You know what we must...

649
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,540
If only I had seen that soda.

650
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,500
I could have stayed.

651
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,340
I'm just gonna pretend that it didn't show up until after I went to sleep.

652
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:18,920
Or something.

653
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,780
I'm just gonna pretend it just showed up.

654
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,820
Ah yeah.

655
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,340
Little sleepy game.

656
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,520
See guys, this is so relaxing.

657
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,980
Isn't this so nice?

658
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,980
They are just gardening and...

659
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,620
Everything is normal.

660
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,870
The grass doesn't grow back I think.

661
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,690
This one didn't have a door handle.

662
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,010
What is this?

663
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,750
High voltage.

664
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,830
I got more grass to cut.

665
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,070
Why does the church look like that?

666
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,030
It's Sunday.

667
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,030
Shouldn't it be full of people?

668
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,290
Shouldn't it be like bustling?

669
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,110
Everyone is like, yep, I'm at church.

670
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,540
Okay.

671
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,080
Still hasn't told me that I cut all the grass.

672
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,680
Is there that much more?

673
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,360
Am I missing an area?

674
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,820
Oh, there is actually quite a bit down here.

675
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,060
Oh, oh.

676
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,720
Am I missing an area?

677
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,620
The answer would be...

678
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,240
Yes.

679
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,660
What is this?

680
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,520
Trash can.

681
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,840
Red door!

682
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,980
To get through here...

683
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,600
To get through here I think we need to go...

684
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,640
Inside, you guys.

685
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,680
To stay at home to make it to stream on time.

686
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:13,720
I don't... I didn't stream that early on Sunday.

687
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,980
You guys, I have... I put on my schedule.

688
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,220
I don't think I posted it to YouTube yet.

689
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,040
But...

690
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,020
Sunday I want to do a hand cam.

691
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,080
Where I get cookie dough.

692
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,860
And I try to shape it...

693
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,220
Into like Halloween things.

694
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,880
Like a bat...

695
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,820
Or a cat...

696
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,920
Or a pumpkin or whatever.

697
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,000
And...

698
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,020
Hope that when I cook it...

699
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,980
It turns out...

700
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,220
How...

701
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,860
How we put it into the oven.

702
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,740
The church is closed.

703
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,840
It's Sunday!

704
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,180
Oh, there is no response.

705
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,400
Alright, it didn't tell me that I cut all the grass though.

706
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,940
School ban performance in the park on Sunday.

707
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,340
Oh wait, I want to go!

708
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,280
The church is temporarily out of service.

709
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,500
I love cookies with Minto.

710
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,660
I don't really bake.

711
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,680
So who knows how these will turn out.

712
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,360
Cusa look at her.

713
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:37,740
Real.

714
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,920
It also didn't tell me that I cut all the hedges.

715
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,660
Because I didn't.

716
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:45,840
I see one.

717
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,340
Right here.

718
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,430
Alright guys.

719
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,310
Time to be brave.

720
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,680
Oh, there is something in there.

721
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:14,860
OK...

722
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,340
That's a painting.

723
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,440
No wonder it's out of service.

724
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,400
There is a dead guy in here!

725
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,880
Oh my god!

726
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,440
Wait, what is that?

727
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,080
Did you guys see that?

728
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,520
The snail is racing!

729
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,420
It wasn't a guy.

730
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,240
It was a snail.

731
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:00,410
Hello?

732
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,450
I got...oh it's a trumpet.

733
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,050
A magic trumpet.

734
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:18,250
Oh, the ghost calms down!

735
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,910
From the trumpet?

736
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,370
Is there anything else that I missed?

737
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,590
Wait, this is where I came from.

738
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,210
So let's go back around.

739
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,070
Hit the skeleton.

740
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:38,210
You think I can?

741
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,590
Sorry buddy.

742
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,410
Oh my god!

743
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:49,730
He is still okay.

744
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,350
Am I okay?

745
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,910
What's over here now?

746
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,630
Venture out of the garden!

747
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,370
Oh my gosh!

748
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:09,850
Wait!

749
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,350
Oh, we did it!

750
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:15,230
Who is this for?

751
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,610
It is a war memorial.

752
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,390
I remember.

753
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:22,750
We can't leap?

754
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:23,230
Flip?

755
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:24,070
Oh, hello.

756
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,010
Okay, cool.

757
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,390
So we came from here.

758
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,310
Like this...what?

759
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:35,650
How?

760
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,250
What?

761
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:38,430
We went under...huh?

762
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:39,570
How did we...

763
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:40,750
What?

764
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:42,590
Okay.

765
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:44,450
Weird.

766
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:47,570
How did we...

767
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,150
Wait, there was a guy sitting here before.

768
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:49,670
Wasn't there not?

769
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,490
The bus is leaving on Monday.

770
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,520
What happened here?

771
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,620
What is happening in this city?

772
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,160
Guards!

773
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:13,540
Police!

774
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:15,800
Anybody?

775
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,260
What was that?

776
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,500
Did you guys see that?

777
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,260
There is someone in here.

778
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,560
Corn!

779
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,120
It's a scarecrow.

780
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:39,000
Somehow I don't think you needed to smack the skeleton with a hammer to get the bone.

781
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,380
Look.

782
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,800
I'm a ghost.

783
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,760
I don't really get how skeletons work.

784
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,480
We are at a gas station.

785
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,700
The gas station is closed today.

786
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,260
That's really inconvenient for...

787
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,740
Anybody who might need gas.

788
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,340
This scruffy character is asking for an egg ball.

789
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,360
What's an egg ball?

790
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,540
Wait, wasn't there...

791
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:18,120
Could be used to make something delicious.

792
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,580
There was the plate.

793
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,200
Maybe we need to make something there.

794
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:22,900
The garden key.

795
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,880
The music it creates sounds otherworldly.

796
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,640
Wasn't there Polaroids?

797
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,540
Oh, here we go.

798
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,220
Red door.

799
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,460
Gas station?

800
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,740
Oh, it's only for Saturday.

801
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,780
And midnight.

802
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,100
Wasn't there planks?

803
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,400
Here!

804
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,640
Planks!

805
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,520
What am I supposed to do with it?

806
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,700
That guy did not care for it.

807
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,740
Oh wait, high voltage.

808
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,160
That's the plank.

809
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,080
I know, I knew it.

810
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,280
Does it go to this?

811
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,680
I repaired the bridge.

812
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,100
I had a feeling.

813
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,140
Now we can just go in and out, baby.

814
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,300
Flip, flip, flip.

815
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,620
Sunday evening.

816
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,100
Trash.

817
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,480
Polaroid next to the bridge.

818
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,920
Yeah, yeah, I remember this one.

819
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,220
Thank you.

820
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,600
There's lots of trash.

821
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,020
Oh my god, are these all cigarettes?

822
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,600
These look like the marble cigarettes.

823
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,640
This place is disgusting.

824
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,380
I'm a gardener for the whole city now, apparently.

825
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,040
Got a coin though.

826
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,160
People are so rude.

827
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:17,440
Looks like America.

828
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,720
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

829
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:26,000
I feel like this is the kind of game where you have to look around every little corner, you know?

830
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,880
How do we...

831
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,000
Oh my gosh, how fast do we have to speedrun this game to...

832
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,520
...get to the gas station on Saturday?

833
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:49,830
Is it leaving?

834
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:55,350
But there's a door.

835
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:57,310
Maybe I can go.

836
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:58,070
Go, go, go.

837
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:04,690
Wait, wait, wait.

838
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:07,850
Okay, I thought it was leaving.

839
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,230
On today's menu?

840
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:14,750
Snert.

841
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:15,690
Again.

842
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:17,310
I'm scared.

843
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:18,410
Why is it so dark in here?

844
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:21,550
And loud.

845
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:26,470
Hello.

846
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:28,690
Hello.

847
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,510
This is a strange looking kid.

848
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:33,330
That's a rude comment.

849
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:35,250
This kid is looking very sad.

850
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:37,650
It is a hot bowl of snert.

851
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,090
Would you like a song?

852
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,320
Tough crowd.

853
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,760
Grab that coin.

854
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:11,770
I'm scared of seeing any mysterious figures in here.

855
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:14,030
Why is this place so...

856
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:17,470
I mean, this whole game is bizarre, but like...

857
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:19,290
This place in particular is very bizarre.

858
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:25,370
Interesting.

859
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:34,010
Terrible vibes, absolutely.

860
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,030
The bicycle somehow brings you...

861
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:43,350
Here.

862
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,140
What do you mean somehow brings me...

863
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,400
Oh, hello.

864
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,180
You cannot make out what they say.

865
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,600
They are playing some kind of game.

866
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,560
Oh, they will not let you take this special piece.

867
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,080
It literally says steal.

868
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,350
I just wanted to, you know...

869
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:31,390
Okay.

870
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:31,550
Okay.

871
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:34,730
Guys, where are we?

872
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:37,370
I'm supposed to be a gardener.

873
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:42,430
Huh?

874
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,590
I'm spooked, I'm spooked.

875
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:49,250
Oh my god, am I in that SpongeBob episode?

876
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:53,170
This looks highly flammable.

877
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:55,050
Okay.

878
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:56,890
Can I go home?

879
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:58,070
Oh, again.

880
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:01,310
Oh, okay.

881
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:08,390
Okay.

882
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:14,960
Don't care.

883
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,240
It's in my blood.

884
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,760
It's in my blood to cut the grass.

885
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,660
It's in my blood.

886
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,060
Okay, there is another...

887
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:27,720
What's this?

888
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,400
Welcome to Middlestum.

889
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,940
Oh my god, I see... Did you see him?

890
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:36,940
Did you see the scarecrow?

891
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,090
Oh, this place we gotta cut the grass.

892
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:58,090
I think I do need to cut the grass here.

893
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:01,590
I think I am sensing that I need to cut the grass here.

894
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:05,150
If I didn't need to cut the grass here...

895
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:06,450
Why is there a tall grass game?

896
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,650
You are giving me... You are allowing me to cut the grass.

897
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,330
I need to cut the grass.

898
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:12,870
I am sensing that I have to cut the grass here.

899
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,130
I'm just saying.

900
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:15,910
I think I have to cut the grass.

901
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,330
Otherwise it wouldn't be so tall.

902
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:23,530
Game, if I didn't need to cut the grass here you wouldn't give me the option to cut the grass.

903
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:25,050
Okay?

904
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:26,690
It's so tall.

905
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:28,770
Alright, let's go inside.

906
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:36,010
What's that?

907
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:37,930
Taking a nap?

908
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,020
Your home is a little flooded though.

909
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,180
Are you okay?

910
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,200
The Chihuahua!

911
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,520
Are you alright?

912
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,940
This person is... They are dead!

913
00:51:59,220 --> 00:51:59,460
Oh god!

914
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,020
Oh god!

915
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:01,280
Oh god!

916
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:01,700
Oh god!

917
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:02,580
Oh my god!

918
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:02,860
Oh my god!

919
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:03,120
Oh my god!

920
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,120
Uh oh.

921
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,080
I can now...

922
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,120
We can now do the stuff!

923
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,480
Wait, what's this way though?

924
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:17,520
Hold on.

925
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,300
I know it's getting late.

926
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:24,540
Nothing like settling in with a nice bowl of snert watching a pair of YouTubers.

927
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,020
Oh, the dog looks curious.

928
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:27,380
Hello.

929
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,080
Give the bone!

930
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,860
The dog likes you!

931
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,340
Oh boy.

932
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:41,360
Fairy.

933
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:42,360
Okay.

934
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,040
We got a toy boat.

935
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,000
Toy boat.

936
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:45,380
Toy boat.

937
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:45,800
Toy boat.

938
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,700
What's that one tongue twister with the toy boat?

939
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,720
Something is awfully creaky here.

940
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,520
There's like... I need to water these too!

941
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,420
Toy boat.

942
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:04,760
Toy boat.

943
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,140
Toy boat.

944
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:05,540
Toy boat.

945
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:05,920
Toy boat.

946
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:08,460
Oh!

947
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:11,940
I'm too good at this game.

948
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,320
What are the letters for?

949
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:18,920
Mohel!

950
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,680
It will not budge.

951
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,040
Okay.

952
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,060
I have to go all the way around.

953
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:39,700
Wait, but I... Do you think I'll get... Do you think those mysterious whatever that tried to murder me before will try to murder me again?

954
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,380
If I'm not... I'm not cutting stuff.

955
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:43,760
I'm...

956
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,360
Molding stuff.

957
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,620
You could cut your way through here.

958
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,520
I think I'm...

959
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,180
A genius!

960
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,160
I'm in the garden!

961
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,880
Wait, we gotta do this before tomorrow!

962
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,420
We gotta get all this stuff before tomorrow!

963
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,620
Wait, I never found the watering can though.

964
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:09,860
What is this?

965
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,560
I think there's a severed hand outside my door.

966
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:16,500
Oh!

967
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:17,460
Wait.

968
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,120
But...

969
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,120
I'm the gardener.

970
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,580
This game is so mysterious.

971
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:34,100
This game is actually so mysterious.

972
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,080
Let's try putting the corn on the plate.

973
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,920
And we have to wait until midnight, remember?

974
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:39,820
To go to the church.

975
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,620
Nope, doesn't let me.

976
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,060
Okay.

977
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,320
Mohel's?

978
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,300
Can you mow my lawn?

979
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,660
For a steep price, I can.

980
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,500
There it goes, Pinto.

981
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,640
Uh-oh.

982
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:03,440
Guys?

983
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:04,600
Uh-oh.

984
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:07,480
Uh-oh.

985
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:09,680
Oh!

986
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,220
What the he...

987
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,800
Did you guys notice this before?

988
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,660
Oh, the mohels are gone!

989
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,940
It's a pretty looking pot.

990
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:31,340
Compass.

991
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,600
This gap is too deep to cross.

992
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,000
And there's something over there.

993
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,100
Okay.

994
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,580
Interesting.

995
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,660
We got all the mohels.

996
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,200
Yippee for us.

997
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:06,250
Somebody created a club in my house.

998
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:13,020
Uh

999
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:20,530
-oh.

1000
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:21,670
It's jammed.

1001
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:26,190
Oh...

1002
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:37,890
I'm almost there.

1003
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:39,190
I'm so close.

1004
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:43,010
You do not have the key.

1005
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:44,890
I think I'm in trouble.

1006
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:48,430
It's that kid!

1007
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,800
You perished in a strange hallway.

1008
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:58,800
Huh?

1009
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,000
Oh...

1010
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,500
Is it you?

1011
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,620
You must be the new gardener.

1012
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:09,180
Do not be scared.

1013
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,920
I do not mean to harm you.

1014
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,360
I am trapped and you have to find me.

1015
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,880
We cannot talk for much longer.

1016
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,740
So I will keep this short.

1017
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,460
There is an unwanted visitor.

1018
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,580
Disguised as an ordinary worm.

1019
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,060
Oh I thought it was the kid that just literally murdered me.

1020
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,080
No way!

1021
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,300
We never got to go to the church.

1022
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,740
You have to find a way to get rid of it.

1023
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,860
We have to conclude our conversation.

1024
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,500
Is it because you took his toy?

1025
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:44,480
I think maybe the toy boat I should have given to them.

1026
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:49,000
I will now send you back.

1027
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,440
What day is it?

1028
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,380
Please be Saturday.

1029
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,800
Progress?

1030
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,320
1 out of 11.

1031
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,600
Ares visited 14 out of 44?

1032
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,300
Oh my gosh.

1033
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,040
Polaroids collected 17 out of 42.

1034
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,180
Polaroids solved 10 out of 42.

1035
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:21,060
Wow!

1036
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,800
It's Saturday!

1037
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,140
Thank you Bus Driver.

1038
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,120
Wait, is the grass short?

1039
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:45,360
We are like totally blocked then.

1040
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:45,660
Okay.

1041
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,480
And then... Does it snap?

1042
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,140
Okay, it does crack.

1043
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:54,660
No!

1044
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,140
No!

1045
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,540
No!

1046
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,320
No!

1047
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,040
This might be the worst game ever.

1048
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,740
What's that sound?

1049
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,060
Oh that, I think.

1050
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:25,820
Wait.

1051
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:26,000
Wait.

1052
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,240
Okay, wait, but the Polaroid is gone.

1053
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,900
There was one in here, remember?

1054
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,500
Endless gardening.

1055
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,740
Yeah, I still have my Polaroids.

1056
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:51,080
I do not have my items though.

1057
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:51,960
Okay.

1058
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:54,680
Interesting.

1059
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:55,820
And then this.

1060
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,220
Wait, I found a Polaroid?

1061
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:12,530
Oh, there's things that are... Okay, the ones that are like full circles are ones that I've...

1062
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:15,530
That I've completed this round.

1063
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:16,650
Got it.

1064
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:23,700
So...

1065
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:25,700
Oh my gosh.

1066
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,080
That guy is going to come back and see me again.

1067
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,640
I knew it.

1068
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,100
Okay.

1069
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:38,100
The true horror of Groundhog's Day, loop of infinite lawn care.

1070
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:40,240
Yeah.

1071
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:42,220
Oh my gosh.

1072
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,280
But like...

1073
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,460
Okay, let's get all the stuff that I know that we need, right?

1074
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,300
Oh, I guess I don't have to get that.

1075
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,160
It's just a coin.

1076
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,380
But you know, maybe I do need it.

1077
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,400
Who knows?

1078
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,520
Shut up, dog!

1079
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:07,600
Why are you purple?

1080
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,540
I don't know.

1081
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:11,880
What?

1082
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,560
Would you prefer me to be blue?

1083
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:31,820
This was always here.

1084
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:33,900
Interesting.

1085
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,320
What is that over there?

1086
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:35,840
Okay.

1087
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:41,860
So I still have to cut this.

1088
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:45,380
Oh, let's leave so we can get to the...

1089
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:50,700
I think we have to have the little door handle pop up, right?

1090
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,800
Let's leave so that we can get to the...

1091
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,440
To the gas station.

1092
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,180
What did Doki say?

1093
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:06,820
Weak!

1094
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:08,940
Okay, Doki.

1095
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,400
Let's see you play this game, huh?

1096
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,960
Let's see you play.

1097
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,620
You wouldn't even be able to get down the hallway.

1098
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,280
You don't even know my struggle.

1099
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,060
You wouldn't even get there because you are too much of a baby.

1100
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,560
You also wouldn't even know what to do because you can't read.

1101
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,080
Doki bird.

1102
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:30,700
Alright.

1103
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,760
See, this area is so spooky, right?

1104
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:33,680
Watch, this is a guy.

1105
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,800
And this is a dead guy.

1106
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,130
And I calmed that guy down.

1107
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:48,630
Oh, the snail is like really far away.

1108
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:50,470
He's racing.

1109
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:53,110
I can play the game right now and beat the game while you are stuck.

1110
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:54,550
I'm not even stuck!

1111
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:56,710
I'm exploring!

1112
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,350
Wait, wrong way.

1113
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:01,450
I'm exploring.

1114
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:03,890
Wait, stuck.

1115
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:06,410
Stuck where?

1116
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:09,690
Stuck who?

1117
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:11,930
Look, I just opened the door.

1118
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:13,810
Stuck my butt.

1119
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:26,550
Oops, I accidentally got one of those flowers.

1120
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:31,330
Whatever happened to Silent Hill 2?

1121
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,650
What, is Doki stuck in Silent Hill 2?

1122
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:37,370
Typical Doki.

1123
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:41,990
What?

1124
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:49,610
Is she only in there on Sundays?

1125
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:57,390
Sundays is when I like to get stuck in the trunk.

1126
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:00,710
This guy wanted an egg thingy.

1127
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:01,210
Alright.

1128
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:03,910
Oh, ok.

1129
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:09,150
I cannot make out what they say.

1130
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:11,870
Something is growling.

1131
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:12,950
What is that?

1132
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:14,730
Something is like...

1133
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:16,010
You are not allowed to go there.

1134
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:22,590
You cannot make out what they say.

1135
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:26,970
Mata is taunting you about being in WME with Kojima.

1136
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:32,710
First of all, you know...

1137
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:34,490
I know she is doing her thing.

1138
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:38,750
Try to follow the rules, you know, about like...

1139
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:39,090
Oh!

1140
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:40,110
Oh my god!

1141
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,590
About like, you know...

1142
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:45,710
Not...

1143
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:50,170
Like, not bringing up other streamers unless I bring them up first or whatever.

1144
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:54,170
But also...

1145
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:59,710
She would not have known about that if I hadn't told her, so...

1146
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:06,030
I'm the one who told her that he was in WME, so...

1147
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:06,470
You know.

1148
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:08,890
What is going on out here?

1149
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:11,770
Oh my god, they do speak.

1150
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,770
Are they gonna take over the...

1151
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,160
Requires a key.

1152
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,740
What is that?

1153
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,700
Hammer time?

1154
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:32,740
I think they are getting angry.

1155
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,120
I think they are getting angry.

1156
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,900
Oh my god, there is more!

1157
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:42,960
Oh my god, wait.

1158
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:48,840
Oh my god!

1159
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:53,310
Wait, they are never...

1160
01:05:54,270 --> 01:05:55,830
This is the worm, right?

1161
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:59,330
Strange door...

1162
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:01,390
Where is this?

1163
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:04,230
Oh, I need my plank.

1164
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:10,330
I forgot to go get the plank.

1165
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:16,790
Strange door, as if nothing else here is strange.

1166
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:21,550
You still want that egg ball or whatever the hell it was?

1167
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:23,350
An egg ball.

1168
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:30,450
Can't decide if people being on this island makes it spookier or less spooky.

1169
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:34,510
Kind of odd you are not reporting the dead bodies.

1170
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,030
You know, it's just...

1171
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:42,410
It's just one of those things.

1172
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:45,530
Oh, I forgot also to grab the bone.

1173
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:47,630
Wait!

1174
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,320
There is someone here.

1175
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,660
You cannot make out what they say.

1176
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,320
Why can't I understand you guys?

1177
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:18,290
It's an empty fishbowl.

1178
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,790
This one leads to...

1179
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:28,130
This looks like where the gnomes live.

1180
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:29,910
There is another dead guy!

1181
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:35,850
I got the bone.

1182
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:39,010
And I got a gnome idol!

1183
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,950
I think they are going to come after me for real now.

1184
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:45,830
But I killed all of them.

1185
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:48,670
We are in the park!

1186
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:51,150
The watering can!

1187
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,430
This area could also use some gardening.

1188
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,550
Praise the gnome, praise the gnome god.

1189
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:02,950
Ok, so I have to clear the park.

1190
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:04,450
I have to clear the church.

1191
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:07,910
And I have to get our own garden.

1192
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:13,030
We need a trowel.

1193
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,210
Wait, but this is a grave.

1194
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:14,470
It's a grave.

1195
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:21,770
That's not a molehill, that's a grave.

1196
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:27,330
What are the words spelling?

1197
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:30,690
We had D...

1198
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:34,790
Oh, this is where we came from, just kidding.

1199
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:40,170
We had D... Oh my gosh!

1200
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:45,690
I got a lighter.

1201
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:51,730
E... What else was there?

1202
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:54,010
Something in this area has changed?

1203
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,300
The house?

1204
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:02,500
What?

1205
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,240
Huh?

1206
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:09,640
I'm spooked.

1207
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:10,620
What do you mean by that?

1208
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,500
Let's try to find the watering can.

1209
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:22,020
The van?

1210
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,880
I don't think so.

1211
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,580
The food truck is closed at the moment.

1212
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:30,880
Ok.

1213
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:33,080
What is this?

1214
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:38,760
I wouldn't even know what was there to begin with.

1215
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,160
Purified stone!

1216
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,200
We know those people!

1217
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:47,020
Woohoo!

1218
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:57,050
I did it.

1219
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:02,130
I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

1220
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:05,530
This is a stunning piece of art.

1221
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:09,970
Ok.

1222
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:12,770
Anything is modern art nowadays, huh?

1223
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:18,210
Even a turd emoji is modern art.

1224
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:22,230
What about this one?

1225
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:24,570
This is supposed to resemble art?

1226
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:26,510
It's a literal pretzel!

1227
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:31,150
What's wrong with that?

1228
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:34,330
There it is!

1229
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:37,170
Secret garden.

1230
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:42,490
Guys, there is so much going on at all times in this game.

1231
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:44,590
My brain cannot even keep up.

1232
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:56,650
Empty mailbox.

1233
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:01,750
It's a lot to remember.

1234
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:04,050
Oh, here it is.

1235
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:08,010
Candles.

1236
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:08,990
Oh, we have a lighter.

1237
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,510
But I think we need to...

1238
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:14,050
light it...

1239
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:16,290
when it gets to the twilight time.

1240
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:17,590
Probably.

1241
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:27,930
We still haven't gotten the trowel.

1242
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:29,670
Which I don't remember where that was actually.

1243
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:32,690
The dog is over here.

1244
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:36,230
He looks curious.

1245
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:41,830
It was near here, right?

1246
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:44,410
Ok.

1247
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:47,270
So let's go give this boat to the kids.

1248
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:48,450
Wait, what was this one?

1249
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:58,750
Dog happy bus game.

1250
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:00,670
Dog so cute.

1251
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:03,550
Ok, over here.

1252
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:06,390
That's right!

1253
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:07,750
Oh yeah, that's right!

1254
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:08,450
It was in here!

1255
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:11,830
Sorry guy.

1256
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:16,010
Sorry.

1257
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:18,310
Taking your trowel.

1258
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:20,970
Obtain all garden...

1259
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:21,750
Oh no, no, no, no!

1260
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:27,190
There we go.

1261
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:28,850
Obtain all gardening tools.

1262
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:29,650
Yippee!

1263
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:31,650
Oh my gosh.

1264
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:34,510
We actually almost just died.

1265
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:39,650
There we go.

1266
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:45,450
Oh my god.

1267
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:49,290
What do I do with the...

1268
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,890
Cannot make out what they say.

1269
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:58,150
I'm cleaning up your garbage.

1270
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:00,670
And I'm stealing your money.

1271
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:06,310
Wasn't this a Polaroid?

1272
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,850
But nothing happened.

1273
01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:23,130
Slick scooter.

1274
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:26,390
Don't mind if I do.

1275
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:27,930
Can I kill them?

1276
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:29,790
Is that a snail?

1277
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:31,250
Steal it?

1278
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:31,930
I'm trying!

1279
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:37,690
Oh, there is someone getting gas.

1280
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:46,310
What do you have in your trunk?

1281
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,220
Don't worry about it.

1282
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:57,280
All these dead gnomes everywhere.

1283
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:00,720
Requires a key.

1284
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,300
Still so much I feel that we can do.

1285
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,480
Still so much that I'm like what to do.

1286
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:22,660
Okay.

1287
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,640
All these dead gnomes everywhere.

1288
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:34,020
Maybe I really didn't need to do that, huh?

1289
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:39,440
Maybe I just should have let them live in peace, huh?

1290
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,120
Maybe.

1291
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:43,940
Alright, hold on.

1292
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:45,880
Let's see.

1293
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,840
Church door at midnight?

1294
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:49,660
Compass.

1295
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,440
I've never even seen this girl.

1296
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,940
Oh, I forgot to go to the...

1297
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:54,180
Let's go to the fairy.

1298
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,780
Wait, did I see the fairy?

1299
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:57,280
Oh yeah.

1300
01:14:59,300 --> 01:14:59,940
It's here.

1301
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:02,040
I thought maybe it was a Sunday event only.

1302
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,280
But no, it is very much here.

1303
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:09,500
Let's give the children their toy, I guess.

1304
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:11,400
And then...

1305
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,500
There is also that couple there.

1306
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,830
You solved the Polaroid.

1307
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:22,190
I did?

1308
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:23,610
Hello!

1309
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:26,390
The toy manages to cheer up the kid.

1310
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:28,170
This kid...

1311
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:28,470
Oh.

1312
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,570
We got the short idol.

1313
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:40,940
Okay.

1314
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,260
Stupid kid.

1315
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:48,520
Can we now go through that hallway without dying because we don't...

1316
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,040
But we don't have the key still though.

1317
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,300
Let's see.

1318
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,100
What do we have?

1319
01:15:56,260 --> 01:16:00,080
A strange small statue of a garden gnome.

1320
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:09,550
We gotta go light the candles.

1321
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:13,190
It might be too late, but let's try.

1322
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:16,330
We gotta go light the candles.

1323
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:20,210
This game is cool.

1324
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:21,150
It is pretty cool.

1325
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:24,150
There is a lot to keep track of though.

1326
01:16:26,610 --> 01:16:29,290
It was in the park, right?

1327
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:30,330
Yeah, it was in the park.

1328
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:31,590
Happy dog.

1329
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:37,550
There is always time to pet the dog.

1330
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:40,150
Oh my gosh.

1331
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:40,610
Run!

1332
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:40,990
Run!

1333
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:41,190
Run!

1334
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:43,990
We are in the park.

1335
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:48,150
Wait, the shop is open.

1336
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:51,770
This might be our only chance.

1337
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:54,630
Wait, is this the egg?

1338
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:56,190
Is this the egg ball?

1339
01:16:57,770 --> 01:16:59,790
I got an egg ball!

1340
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:03,430
Wow, that cost me so much money!

1341
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:07,770
This guy better be worth it.

1342
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:31,210
It's her!

1343
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:34,250
Computer.

1344
01:17:40,450 --> 01:17:42,150
It cost 4F.

1345
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:43,190
I need more money.

1346
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:45,350
That guy took all my money.

1347
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:46,630
Strange disk.

1348
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:47,870
Office key.

1349
01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:49,370
Gold medal.

1350
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:54,270
Where am I?

1351
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:58,270
Oh, I'm here!

1352
01:17:58,430 --> 01:17:58,670
Okay.

1353
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:00,710
Cool, we can go back to the gas station.

1354
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:06,710
Oh my gosh, that dang egg ball took all my money.

1355
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:09,130
That's the KFP house.

1356
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:13,290
Uh oh, it's night time.

1357
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:18,130
Wasn't there a Polaroid of this guy?

1358
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:22,590
Oh no, this guy.

1359
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:24,030
Trash.

1360
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:33,190
What are those 3B...

1361
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:39,010
Oh, I think they are the areas that they are in.

1362
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:39,710
Right?

1363
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:41,370
Like...

1364
01:18:41,370 --> 01:18:44,030
One is the garden.

1365
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:45,950
Okay, that makes more sense.

1366
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,140
Obtain kid's triangle.

1367
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:07,780
You traded the egg ball for the triangle.

1368
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,100
Okay, thanks!

1369
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,240
Oh my gosh, a scarecrow.

1370
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:16,400
She seems focused on something.

1371
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:20,920
What?

1372
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:24,920
What?

1373
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:30,290
What is she so focused on?

1374
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:36,850
So creepy!

1375
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:40,150
So creepy!

1376
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:44,890
That wasn't the lady from the trunk, was it?

1377
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:51,090
What was that?

1378
01:19:57,910 --> 01:19:59,430
We gotta wait for midnight.

1379
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:04,130
Oh my god, the music is getting scarier.

1380
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:09,630
Oh my god!

1381
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:12,510
Oh my god!

1382
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:20,450
Turn it down just a little bit.

1383
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:22,970
I haven't cut any of this stuff.

1384
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:24,230
You think we are gonna be in trouble?

1385
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:27,010
Fugoo, welcome to the membership.

1386
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:27,810
Thank you!

1387
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:30,350
Okay, hold on.

1388
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:36,550
The triangle.

1389
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:36,830
Cool.

1390
01:20:41,210 --> 01:20:41,930
Watering can.

1391
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:44,170
Can you doot?

1392
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,040
I can't tell if I was so scared that I...

1393
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,560
Changed items or... Oh my gosh, it's getting really...

1394
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,100
It's getting really kinda spooky out here.

1395
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,000
Oh my god!

1396
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:11,520
Leave me alone!

1397
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,560
Just one more hour!

1398
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:15,820
Let me in, please.

1399
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:16,760
Please let me in.

1400
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,480
Please let me in!

1401
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:22,520
Twitch to trowel.

1402
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:29,800
Well...

1403
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,620
Might as well while we are waiting.

1404
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,400
I thought...

1405
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,400
I thought he was like attacking because I...

1406
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:42,540
Was gardening past my bedtime, but...

1407
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:43,840
Clearly he didn't care.

1408
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,780
Okay, I'm afraid that midnight though is gonna get bad.

1409
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:52,140
So I wanna stay in the area, you know?

1410
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,700
I wanna stay so that if...

1411
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:59,000
We get jump scared, you know?

1412
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,280
You like that?

1413
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,200
Oh my gosh, I mean rather if there is a chase scene...

1414
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:07,420
If there is a chase scene, it's right there, you know?

1415
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:08,760
Oh gosh.

1416
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,120
Okay, 15 more minutes.

1417
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:12,240
We are okay.

1418
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:13,540
Midnight!

1419
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:18,460
Hello?

1420
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:20,780
Church key.

1421
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,340
Store requires a key to unlock.

1422
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,440
Store is shut tight.

1423
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:30,000
There is no...

1424
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,800
We got an old plank.

1425
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,000
Okay.

1426
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:36,980
Time to go to bed!

1427
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:40,700
Okay, so we can go to sleep at midnight then.

1428
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:45,000
Rather than going to sleep...

1429
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:50,420
At like 9pm or whatever the hell we were doing before.

1430
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:57,610
Is there something else in the grass?

1431
01:22:57,610 --> 01:22:57,650
Grass?

1432
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:03,430
Oh my god!

1433
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:10,130
Why do you leave your hand by the window?

1434
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:11,830
You feel safe in here.

1435
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:16,290
That's really good to know.

1436
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:19,070
That I feel safe in here.

1437
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:21,530
That's so...

1438
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:23,750
That's so good to know.

1439
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:25,690
Is there stuff out here then?

1440
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:38,970
I don't know.

1441
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:51,770
I feel safe in here?

1442
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:54,850
After that?

1443
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:58,030
Trying to see if other stuff happens.

1444
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:01,630
Our vision is getting really wacky though.

1445
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:02,130
You see that?

1446
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:03,430
Okay, I'm just going to go to sleep.

1447
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:05,530
I am going to go to sleep.

1448
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:13,170
Good morning everybody!

1449
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:16,570
Brand new day.

1450
01:24:17,070 --> 01:24:18,230
Everything is okay.

1451
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:22,390
I'm ready to cut the grass and trim the hedges.

1452
01:24:23,150 --> 01:24:26,630
I'm ready to do my gardening duties.

1453
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:30,310
Oh, the magpie.

1454
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:30,350
Okay.

1455
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,440
Cut some coosa.

1456
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,880
And some mole hills.

1457
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:51,100
I don't know how you are supposed to get everything done in time though.

1458
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:52,620
Like, truly.

1459
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:54,300
What was in here again?

1460
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:56,860
Oh, the idols.

1461
01:24:56,980 --> 01:24:57,380
That's right.

1462
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:05,660
Good morning, Minto.

1463
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:07,400
Wait, can we put the plank here?

1464
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:07,920
Yes!

1465
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:12,560
Warning, this maze is very difficult to navigate.

1466
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:17,160
Symbols!

1467
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:18,740
Carry 20 items at once.

1468
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:20,040
Interesting.

1469
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:22,260
Weren't there kids in the park?

1470
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:24,440
Like, didn't it say that they...

1471
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:25,560
Were...

1472
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,820
That there was like a... What's it called?

1473
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:32,720
Some sort of...

1474
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:35,840
Show in the park that the kids were doing or something.

1475
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:37,440
Oh, there they are!

1476
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:43,060
Yakuza fiance opening is so catchy.

1477
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:45,380
Yeah, people were telling me about it.

1478
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,820
Oh, I can give him the triangle.

1479
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:49,300
And you...

1480
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,720
This kid is missing their trumpet.

1481
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:52,300
Give you the symbols.

1482
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:57,940
I have a trumpet.

1483
01:25:57,940 --> 01:26:00,420
Okay, step aside kids.

1484
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,420
I'm way better than you could ever be, kid.

1485
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:20,860
You cannot make out what they say.

1486
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:21,800
Of course I cannot.

1487
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,380
Okay, let's check our stuff.

1488
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:30,340
We need money for the compass.

1489
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,380
We need to somehow get the church key.

1490
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:43,000
The strange hallway, we need the key for that too.

1491
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:46,500
And then trash?

1492
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:47,420
Sunday evening.

1493
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:48,620
So we do that tonight.

1494
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:51,120
Yeah, we need to find the trumpet.

1495
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,200
And then it said we need to cut grass in here too.

1496
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:56,460
Holy moly, the life of a gardener.

1497
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:58,500
I never expected it to be so tough.

1498
01:27:03,630 --> 01:27:04,930
Did I go in here?

1499
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:09,350
Oh, there is another door.

1500
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:10,090
Okay, just kidding.

1501
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:18,230
Do you think the gardener or the owner of the house would be mad if I...

1502
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:22,090
...didn't finish?

1503
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:24,730
Oh, go through the maze?

1504
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:28,170
Yeah, I guess we can attempt that, huh?

1505
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:29,690
I'm afraid of dying.

1506
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:31,370
Having to restart.

1507
01:27:32,110 --> 01:27:33,610
Do everything all over again.

1508
01:27:34,430 --> 01:27:35,310
Where was the maze again?

1509
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:39,410
Oh, I know.

1510
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:42,030
Over here.

1511
01:27:44,190 --> 01:27:46,490
Let's at least get the molehills, right?

1512
01:27:46,490 --> 01:27:46,550
Alright.

1513
01:27:53,450 --> 01:27:56,030
And the magpie, we heard that guy.

1514
01:27:57,810 --> 01:28:00,330
And we read that before.

1515
01:28:02,290 --> 01:28:03,230
Oh, the hedges.

1516
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:09,310
Nice.

1517
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:11,810
And then what else?

1518
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:13,290
Oh my gosh!

1519
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:16,190
Oh wow!

1520
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:18,190
They really light up.

1521
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:19,050
They come to life.

1522
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:24,170
They are like born anew.

1523
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:29,090
Each...

1524
01:28:30,190 --> 01:28:30,730
Find...

1525
01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:34,750
Find each ending and then restart the cleaning process.

1526
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:35,830
Yeah, I know.

1527
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:42,320
And I don't know what kind of endings there are either so far, so I'm just like...

1528
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:45,200
Just kind of trying to do whatever.

1529
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:52,460
Does this have anything in it?

1530
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:52,720
No.

1531
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:57,360
I think there was some more stuff over here to the water.

1532
01:28:58,780 --> 01:28:59,880
Are dead gnomes.

1533
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:01,480
Everybody is dead.

1534
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:04,680
Okay.

1535
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:08,180
Oh, let's see if this lady is in here.

1536
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:15,540
Oh, she is!

1537
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,000
She is!

1538
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:25,660
Is she alive, you think?

1539
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:34,820
Okay.

1540
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:36,660
She's taking a nap.

1541
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:38,200
So true.

1542
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:40,980
I guess we'll try the maze.

1543
01:29:44,650 --> 01:29:47,150
I also nap in my trunk, you know?

1544
01:29:48,410 --> 01:29:51,430
This is definitely the perfect place for nobody to bother you.

1545
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:58,240
I guess the town gardener is doing his job well.

1546
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,840
I'm not needed here.

1547
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:07,550
Well, every time I walk through, I'll cut some more grass.

1548
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:16,810
Alright guys, I'm gonna need your help.

1549
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:20,170
Left or right?

1550
01:30:21,190 --> 01:30:21,890
Left or right?

1551
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:29,700
This Outer Wilds is more chill.

1552
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:32,340
This one feels like you're rushing against the clock, right?

1553
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:33,200
Left?

1554
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:34,560
Okay, I saw a lot of left.

1555
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,460
This is a dead end.

1556
01:30:42,690 --> 01:30:43,590
I'm scared.

1557
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:46,690
I'm scared.

1558
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:53,690
I'm stuck in a loop?

1559
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:56,810
Hi!

1560
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,950
Touching the symbol immobilizes you?

1561
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:04,510
The walls start to move?

1562
01:31:09,490 --> 01:31:11,310
Am I dead?

1563
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:13,070
No!

1564
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,770
The new gardener.

1565
01:31:25,070 --> 01:31:25,890
Unwanted visitor.

1566
01:31:25,990 --> 01:31:26,810
It's a worm!

1567
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:30,770
We haven't found a worm or anything like that.

1568
01:31:32,330 --> 01:31:33,330
Get mazed.

1569
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:52,490
What if I don't kill the gnomes?

1570
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:53,530
I wonder what will happen.

1571
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:56,830
You know?

1572
01:31:58,490 --> 01:32:03,350
If I don't kill the gnomes, what will happen instead?

1573
01:32:06,630 --> 01:32:09,710
What if I cut this grass before...

1574
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:10,830
Oh, nevermind.

1575
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:14,050
Maybe we have to stand in the special areas.

1576
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:17,110
Yeah, what do the letters mean?

1577
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:21,830
What if I don't kill the gnomes?

1578
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:26,330
I don't know, because I killed that one gnome to get the coin out of him.

1579
01:32:27,410 --> 01:32:28,470
Are they going to be angry?

1580
01:32:28,650 --> 01:32:29,890
Are they going to be like...

1581
01:32:29,890 --> 01:32:31,710
Yo man, we know you killed that gnome.

1582
01:32:32,190 --> 01:32:33,630
We're coming for you in your sleep.

1583
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:37,030
Are they going to have a gnome takeover?

1584
01:32:39,230 --> 01:32:40,530
It's so gnome over.

1585
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:45,650
Letters say skill issue.

1586
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:48,490
I followed your advice.

1587
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:49,790
You guys said...

1588
01:32:49,790 --> 01:32:50,910
Go to the left, Minto.

1589
01:32:51,390 --> 01:32:54,650
And then everything else was either a dead end or...

1590
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:56,130
You know?

1591
01:32:57,470 --> 01:32:59,210
Everything else was one way.

1592
01:33:00,350 --> 01:33:01,570
Go to the left, Minto.

1593
01:33:02,150 --> 01:33:03,290
That's the correct way.

1594
01:33:06,030 --> 01:33:07,770
That's the correct way, Minto.

1595
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:08,930
You gotta go to the left.

1596
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:12,790
I don't want to be gnomed.

1597
01:33:13,530 --> 01:33:16,270
And there's going to be guy right...

1598
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:16,550
Now!

1599
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,640
I'm not afraid anymore, guys.

1600
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:24,540
I've grown stronger.

1601
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:25,660
Braver.

1602
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:27,360
Braver than ever before.

1603
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:30,240
Recent streams are all maid duties?

1604
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:34,100
I guess kind of, huh?

1605
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:37,140
Oh, I forgot to get the hammer.

1606
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,220
That guy is talking.

1607
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:42,880
He's saying a lot of words over here.

1608
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:56,760
I don't know.

1609
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:58,500
I guess I'm just drawn to the maid...

1610
01:33:58,500 --> 01:33:59,900
It's like, you know...

1611
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:02,660
The maid...

1612
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:03,980
Some...

1613
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:06,140
My destiny, you know?

1614
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:08,400
My maidly instincts.

1615
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:15,000
What if I use the plank...

1616
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,940
To fix...

1617
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:18,120
To not fix this.

1618
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,300
Till later.

1619
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,360
And we went back into the maze.

1620
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:23,580
Let's try that.

1621
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:29,380
Let's get the plank to not fix the maze just yet.

1622
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:32,200
Or fix the bridge and go through the maze instead.

1623
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:35,520
Wait.

1624
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:37,280
How do I do... Oh yeah.

1625
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:38,460
We gotta get the...

1626
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:40,360
We gotta get the door handle.

1627
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:46,280
This guy is here!

1628
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:50,860
La la la.

1629
01:34:54,280 --> 01:35:01,180
It's an important maid duty of escaping a Soviet base, riding a sidecar on a motorcycle and shooting a machine gun.

1630
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:03,980
I mean...

1631
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:08,060
I might only be speaking for myself here, but...

1632
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:10,800
Do you think the signs say gnome?

1633
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:13,700
Oh, there it is.

1634
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,480
Like, we have an O.

1635
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:18,120
We have an M.

1636
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:19,860
Give me an O!

1637
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:21,380
Give me an M!

1638
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:24,120
Give me a...

1639
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,680
Give me a...

1640
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:32,380
What else?

1641
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:41,500
What else was... A D!

1642
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,260
Mindo doesn't have a D in it.

1643
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:49,520
Don't lie.

1644
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:51,700
Is it this one?

1645
01:35:52,140 --> 01:35:53,060
Where the hell is the exit?

1646
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:57,840
Oh, here we go.

1647
01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:03,390
Money.

1648
01:36:06,530 --> 01:36:07,970
Money, money, money.

1649
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:10,270
Money, money, money.

1650
01:36:10,810 --> 01:36:14,490
Alright, let's get this plank and then let's go back to...

1651
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:19,470
Oh, here.

1652
01:36:20,550 --> 01:36:21,450
Go back.

1653
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:24,950
When did the gnomes show up?

1654
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:26,810
I can buy a lighter!

1655
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:30,090
I mean, I just found one before.

1656
01:36:30,210 --> 01:36:30,410
What?

1657
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:31,530
They are scamming people!

1658
01:36:32,330 --> 01:36:33,990
You can find one in the park!

1659
01:36:34,610 --> 01:36:37,150
And instead you have the option to buy one?

1660
01:36:37,950 --> 01:36:38,410
No!

1661
01:36:42,150 --> 01:36:44,730
To go back though, I'm gonna have to go back through the church.

1662
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:47,490
It's a little bit inconvenient, but...

1663
01:36:48,110 --> 01:36:48,470
Whatever.

1664
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:54,390
I can just find one on the ground and instead you are charging people?

1665
01:36:55,430 --> 01:36:56,350
Absolute scam.

1666
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:59,010
Scam, scam, scam.

1667
01:37:07,210 --> 01:37:08,790
Ok, it worked.

1668
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:10,030
Alright guys.

1669
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:13,090
We are gonna go to the right.

1670
01:37:15,070 --> 01:37:16,370
Which one do we go through?

1671
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:17,890
One or two?

1672
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:21,910
One or two?

1673
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:23,150
Two?

1674
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:23,970
I saw two first.

1675
01:37:32,970 --> 01:37:33,810
Oh.

1676
01:37:35,770 --> 01:37:36,610
Wait.

1677
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:37,750
Huh?

1678
01:37:38,370 --> 01:37:39,110
Who?

1679
01:37:42,430 --> 01:37:44,210
Oh, I forgot to get the hammer.

1680
01:37:45,790 --> 01:37:48,150
Wait, there is only one...

1681
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,300
There is only one way to...

1682
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:54,080
Gosh.

1683
01:37:57,660 --> 01:37:58,960
Wait a second.

1684
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:04,500
Huh?

1685
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:04,640
No!

1686
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:11,790
What are you doing up there?

1687
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:17,260
Why are you looking at me like that?

1688
01:38:20,930 --> 01:38:23,250
Ok, I'm not gonna touch it obviously.

1689
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:29,350
No!

1690
01:38:30,650 --> 01:38:31,170
No!

1691
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:39,520
Ok, I guess let's restart our day.

1692
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,020
Oh my gosh, how lame.

1693
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:45,040
No!

1694
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:53,540
At least it was early after all.

1695
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:56,000
Oh!

1696
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:57,940
That's so cute, his move.

1697
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:01,720
Yeah, I succumb to the maze.

1698
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:02,840
Gosh.

1699
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:08,180
Yeah, I think I'll need an item or something, something.

1700
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:16,580
Ok, well if we can't do the maze...

1701
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:20,480
The compass!

1702
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:23,700
Oh my gosh, yes, probably.

1703
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:28,560
And if I don't buy...

1704
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:32,780
If I don't buy the... What's it called?

1705
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,140
The egg ball.

1706
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:39,260
We should be able to buy the compass instead.

1707
01:39:47,050 --> 01:39:48,690
Can you jump down the well?

1708
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:50,990
I can try.

1709
01:39:51,190 --> 01:39:52,950
Before it was just like...

1710
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:55,210
I see no end in sight for this well.

1711
01:39:59,430 --> 01:40:01,470
How are you supposed to do everything in this game?

1712
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:06,910
I guess if you stay up until midnight...

1713
01:40:06,910 --> 01:40:08,530
You're a real rebel.

1714
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:11,530
You can get it all done in time, I guess.

1715
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:25,690
There's the magpie.

1716
01:40:26,830 --> 01:40:28,210
There's the gnome.

1717
01:40:28,530 --> 01:40:29,530
My nemesis.

1718
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:32,570
Ok, perfect.

1719
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:34,550
Give me one second guys.

1720
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:36,730
Oh my gosh.

1721
01:40:51,870 --> 01:40:53,810
Hold on, am I forgetting something?

1722
01:40:53,810 --> 01:40:53,930
Am I forgetting something?

1723
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:51,660
Sorry guys, I just got jammed and I'm like...

1724
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:54,640
Wait, there was no plan for this.

1725
01:42:15,070 --> 01:42:16,750
Oh my gosh, ok.

1726
01:42:18,610 --> 01:42:19,170
Sorry.

1727
01:42:20,630 --> 01:42:21,410
Everything's good.

1728
01:42:21,490 --> 01:42:22,070
Everything's fine.

1729
01:42:22,070 --> 01:42:22,150
Everything's good.

1730
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:23,690
Everything's all good.

1731
01:42:25,150 --> 01:42:26,030
No worries.

1732
01:42:30,330 --> 01:42:32,970
I just saw I had so many DMs all of a sudden.

1733
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:34,030
I was like, what's going on?

1734
01:42:34,630 --> 01:42:35,370
What did I miss?

1735
01:42:37,630 --> 01:42:38,870
But it was all nothing.

1736
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:41,170
Well, it's something, but it's all good.

1737
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:44,990
Give me hammer.

1738
01:42:47,230 --> 01:42:48,430
And... jump scare.

1739
01:42:52,370 --> 01:42:52,810
Ok.

1740
01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:56,490
Give me scissors.

1741
01:42:58,290 --> 01:42:59,830
Give me power.

1742
01:43:01,150 --> 01:43:03,070
Give me magpie.

1743
01:43:05,530 --> 01:43:07,790
Whatever Minto tells him not to cry.

1744
01:43:08,670 --> 01:43:10,070
I can't make out what she's saying.

1745
01:43:12,810 --> 01:43:14,350
What are you talking about?

1746
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:16,410
What are you talking about?

1747
01:43:16,770 --> 01:43:17,650
Wait, did I fix this?

1748
01:43:17,870 --> 01:43:18,770
Oh no, we haven't left.

1749
01:43:18,890 --> 01:43:19,250
Oh my gosh.

1750
01:43:19,490 --> 01:43:21,070
I'm getting all my...

1751
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:22,110
I'm getting all my...

1752
01:43:23,190 --> 01:43:25,070
My ReZero reruns...

1753
01:43:26,150 --> 01:43:26,570
Confused.

1754
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:31,950
Wait, the guy's not here.

1755
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:33,770
Interesting.

1756
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:37,290
Is he only here at a certain time?

1757
01:43:37,630 --> 01:43:39,570
But it's like, he's like here really early then.

1758
01:43:40,170 --> 01:43:42,550
Oh wait, we gotta cut the grass so we can get the doorknob.

1759
01:43:45,610 --> 01:43:46,450
Doorknob, doorknob.

1760
01:43:46,830 --> 01:43:48,430
I gotta get the trowel.

1761
01:43:48,510 --> 01:43:49,470
Wasn't there...

1762
01:43:49,470 --> 01:43:50,430
Oh, it was in the park.

1763
01:43:50,630 --> 01:43:51,070
Not here.

1764
01:43:52,050 --> 01:43:54,010
It was like the little grave mole hill.

1765
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:05,180
Doorknob, doorknob.

1766
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:07,600
Doorknob, where are you?

1767
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:09,300
Doorknob, come to me.

1768
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,700
Oh, I think I just cut a thing.

1769
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:13,700
Oh, what if I cut all these?

1770
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:15,780
Oh.

1771
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:20,160
Mister?

1772
01:44:27,110 --> 01:44:28,670
I never got the...

1773
01:44:28,670 --> 01:44:29,930
I never got the...

1774
01:44:31,710 --> 01:44:34,030
I never got the...

1775
01:44:34,030 --> 01:44:35,490
I

1776
01:44:40,890 --> 01:44:42,570
never got the trumpet.

1777
01:44:43,570 --> 01:44:44,410
The doot-doot.

1778
01:44:44,610 --> 01:44:46,130
Oh my gosh, please no.

1779
01:44:47,950 --> 01:44:49,650
Oh my god.

1780
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:53,090
Well, we discovered another ending, I guess.

1781
01:44:55,650 --> 01:44:56,430
Quick death.

1782
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:01,260
Okay.

1783
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:13,230
I didn't think I would die so suddenly.

1784
01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:14,950
Gosh.

1785
01:45:16,570 --> 01:45:19,110
Well, now we know they are sacred flowers.

1786
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:23,790
Do not grub...

1787
01:45:23,790 --> 01:45:25,170
the sacred flowers.

1788
01:45:27,950 --> 01:45:30,150
Stand in the magical light, maybe.

1789
01:45:30,370 --> 01:45:30,930
It's a good thing.

1790
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:31,570
Who knows?

1791
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:34,810
I have no idea what's good and what's bad anymore in this game.

1792
01:45:34,890 --> 01:45:35,690
I have no idea.

1793
01:45:38,370 --> 01:45:40,570
Yeah, we could try it again once we have the doot-doot.

1794
01:45:41,510 --> 01:45:42,810
Try and calm them down.

1795
01:45:44,770 --> 01:45:47,990
Like I said, all my runs are getting...

1796
01:45:49,790 --> 01:45:50,150
Like...

1797
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:52,490
They are all getting...

1798
01:45:57,590 --> 01:45:58,750
Mixed up together.

1799
01:45:58,910 --> 01:45:59,890
It's okay though.

1800
01:46:00,030 --> 01:46:01,630
All I did was do this stuff, so...

1801
01:46:02,810 --> 01:46:03,330
Honestly...

1802
01:46:03,330 --> 01:46:05,430
Didn't miss so much.

1803
01:46:09,550 --> 01:46:10,070
Honestly...

1804
01:46:10,070 --> 01:46:12,390
I just made it to the garden.

1805
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:35,740
And we gotta get more money.

1806
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:39,760
Let's try and get... Let's aim for the compass this time.

1807
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:43,340
Let's aim for the compass.

1808
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:48,900
No, I think the compass is for the maze.

1809
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:50,100
I have a feeling.

1810
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:52,580
I have a feeling it's for the maze.

1811
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:54,220
Right?

1812
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:55,940
Otherwise, there is nothing else.

1813
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:58,560
Oh my gosh, sorry.

1814
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:00,480
I have a Java update.

1815
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:07,280
lol Did I get all the... Oh, here is some more hedges.

1816
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:08,420
There we go.

1817
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,040
We trimmed the hedges.

1818
01:47:16,830 --> 01:47:17,710
Hi, windows.

1819
01:47:18,410 --> 01:47:19,390
Windows jump scare.

1820
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:21,250
Oh, there is all this to water too.

1821
01:47:22,130 --> 01:47:24,610
Oh my gosh, this game is like...

1822
01:47:25,810 --> 01:47:27,670
Actually so much...

1823
01:47:27,670 --> 01:47:28,810
That I didn't expect.

1824
01:47:30,510 --> 01:47:32,610
So much more like...

1825
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:36,230
In depth than I imagined it to be.

1826
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:42,830
But it is really satisfying.

1827
01:47:42,970 --> 01:47:46,090
I kinda wish there was just a mode where you can cut the grass.

1828
01:47:48,890 --> 01:47:53,350
Wish there was a mode where I just cut the grass and go on my merry way.

1829
01:47:58,370 --> 01:47:59,990
You thought it was kusoge?

1830
01:47:59,990 --> 01:48:00,090
kusoge?

1831
01:48:02,070 --> 01:48:06,130
No, I remember when I was watching the other person play, I was like...

1832
01:48:06,970 --> 01:48:09,590
This seems kind of interesting and mysterious.

1833
01:48:10,130 --> 01:48:10,830
You know me.

1834
01:48:11,430 --> 01:48:12,670
I love a good mystery.

1835
01:48:15,050 --> 01:48:15,810
There it is.

1836
01:48:16,570 --> 01:48:18,830
I love me a good mystery.

1837
01:48:19,490 --> 01:48:20,430
It's a kusoge.

1838
01:48:20,430 --> 01:48:20,550
I'm alive.

1839
01:48:28,150 --> 01:48:29,230
Hello snail.

1840
01:48:30,010 --> 01:48:33,510
Why was the snail before so close to the finish line?

1841
01:48:33,610 --> 01:48:35,890
And now every time I see him...

1842
01:48:35,890 --> 01:48:37,430
He is not close at all.

1843
01:48:41,030 --> 01:48:42,510
It's very mysterious.

1844
01:48:51,490 --> 01:48:52,750
Because I took forever?

1845
01:48:52,750 --> 01:48:57,130
Was it because it was close to Sunday?

1846
01:48:59,550 --> 01:49:01,530
You can't say I took forever.

1847
01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:03,230
I was exploring.

1848
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:07,030
I was looking at everything.

1849
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:08,890
I was investigating.

1850
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:14,150
Yeah, sure, I was taking forever.

1851
01:49:14,370 --> 01:49:16,090
Can you cut the corn, I wonder?

1852
01:49:17,030 --> 01:49:17,790
Oh, that's right.

1853
01:49:17,950 --> 01:49:18,850
There is the corn.

1854
01:49:19,290 --> 01:49:20,570
By the scarecrow.

1855
01:49:24,230 --> 01:49:25,110
I'm scared.

1856
01:49:27,550 --> 01:49:28,730
Where is the scarecrow?

1857
01:49:28,810 --> 01:49:29,330
Oh, over here.

1858
01:49:31,890 --> 01:49:32,330
Corn.

1859
01:49:33,810 --> 01:49:34,690
Thank you, scarecrow.

1860
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:41,650
It gets really dark in there, so it spooks me a little bit.

1861
01:49:43,850 --> 01:49:46,150
By a little bit, I mean like a lot a bit.

1862
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:50,890
Guys, I can't remember where we all got money from.

1863
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:52,870
I think we should rob this place.

1864
01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:54,710
Lady, give me all that you got.

1865
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:04,200
Vandalism.

1866
01:50:09,290 --> 01:50:10,750
That's me in the future.

1867
01:50:11,970 --> 01:50:12,650
What, the grandma?

1868
01:50:17,170 --> 01:50:18,570
I think there is one in here.

1869
01:50:19,030 --> 01:50:21,030
Alright, so we have how much?

1870
01:50:22,130 --> 01:50:23,330
We have five.

1871
01:50:23,470 --> 01:50:24,550
Wait, that's all we need.

1872
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:27,710
So, let's see.

1873
01:50:28,510 --> 01:50:29,830
The dog is over here.

1874
01:50:32,330 --> 01:50:34,390
I don't have a bone for him though.

1875
01:50:37,050 --> 01:50:38,850
We need the trowel in here.

1876
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:47,260
I know how it works.

1877
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:48,580
Money.

1878
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:49,780
There is a coin.

1879
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:52,880
Fortnite skin.

1880
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:55,800
This person is dead.

1881
01:50:58,160 --> 01:50:59,480
Good thing too.

1882
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,700
They don't notice me robbing them.

1883
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:07,480
Oh my god.

1884
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,800
No, no, no, no, no.

1885
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,980
No, no, no, no, no.

1886
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:10,580
I'm gonna drown.

1887
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:11,140
I'm gonna drown.

1888
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:12,720
Oh my god.

1889
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,300
Oh my gosh.

1890
01:51:21,830 --> 01:51:22,870
That was bad.

1891
01:51:22,970 --> 01:51:23,710
That was really bad.

1892
01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:25,730
Hey puppy.

1893
01:51:29,390 --> 01:51:30,670
The dog looks angry.

1894
01:51:30,830 --> 01:51:32,410
There is a guy fishing over there.

1895
01:51:32,910 --> 01:51:34,050
Wait, I need to get some bone.

1896
01:51:34,170 --> 01:51:34,870
I need to get a bone.

1897
01:51:38,730 --> 01:51:40,470
I'm currently boneless.

1898
01:51:41,250 --> 01:51:46,970
Which, in another story, might be a good thing.

1899
01:51:49,330 --> 01:51:52,810
Alright, let's go get the bone.

1900
01:51:52,990 --> 01:51:55,750
I don't remember where the second bone was that I could have gotten.

1901
01:52:00,650 --> 01:52:04,170
I don't remember, so I'm just gonna go back in here and grab it.

1902
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:06,370
Oh.

1903
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:09,290
So eager to leave.

1904
01:52:10,450 --> 01:52:11,250
Thank you.

1905
01:52:16,770 --> 01:52:17,550
This way.

1906
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:22,170
Cut some more grass every time I go through.

1907
01:52:24,870 --> 01:52:27,550
Oh, grab some more trash every time I go through.

1908
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:30,990
Empty plate.

1909
01:52:33,430 --> 01:52:34,070
Okay.

1910
01:52:35,370 --> 01:52:36,010
Alrighty.

1911
01:52:37,410 --> 01:52:38,150
Come here dog.

1912
01:52:39,410 --> 01:52:40,730
I got you a bone.

1913
01:52:41,870 --> 01:52:43,070
Oh my god, I see that guy fishing.

1914
01:52:43,190 --> 01:52:43,990
I see him over there.

1915
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:47,010
Good boy.

1916
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:48,450
Good boy.

1917
01:52:48,850 --> 01:52:49,510
Good boy.

1918
01:52:50,230 --> 01:52:51,310
Good boy.

1919
01:52:52,050 --> 01:52:53,110
Grab that.

1920
01:52:54,350 --> 01:52:58,050
Oh my gosh, I'm running around at the speed of sound.

1921
01:53:00,210 --> 01:53:02,770
Trying to find what's going on in this town.

1922
01:53:04,210 --> 01:53:04,730
What?

1923
01:53:11,330 --> 01:53:13,290
Why can't I understand anybody?

1924
01:53:13,950 --> 01:53:15,370
Oh no, we can't go through here.

1925
01:53:16,210 --> 01:53:17,250
I didn't buy the lighter.

1926
01:53:20,670 --> 01:53:21,190
Alrighty.

1927
01:53:32,030 --> 01:53:34,210
What else was there?

1928
01:53:37,950 --> 01:53:39,830
Find the lighter in the park.

1929
01:53:40,630 --> 01:53:43,150
Yeah, but I gotta get to the park.

1930
01:53:47,570 --> 01:53:49,870
I found the lighter!

1931
01:53:50,310 --> 01:53:51,750
No way!

1932
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:53,950
No way!

1933
01:53:59,330 --> 01:54:01,090
There's no gnomes this time.

1934
01:54:02,650 --> 01:54:03,110
Interesting.

1935
01:54:03,970 --> 01:54:06,310
Is it because I didn't kill the initial gnome?

1936
01:54:09,330 --> 01:54:10,890
Should I kill the initial gnome?

1937
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:16,200
When you pick up a lighter, it makes you heavier.

1938
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:18,060
Wait, what do you mean?

1939
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:22,930
Is there weight in this game?

1940
01:54:24,590 --> 01:54:25,570
I don't feel slower.

1941
01:54:32,620 --> 01:54:35,380
It makes me lie!

1942
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:55,820
Shut up.

1943
01:54:58,820 --> 01:55:01,900
Wait, how do I open this door, you guys?

1944
01:55:03,540 --> 01:55:05,060
How do I open it?

1945
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:11,540
Not like that.

1946
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:14,400
Anything in here?

1947
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:15,180
No?

1948
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:17,960
Dig up the grave.

1949
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:18,900
Oh yeah, that's right!

1950
01:55:19,740 --> 01:55:20,460
Where was it?

1951
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:23,540
A little grave.

1952
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:24,520
I'm gonna dig it up.

1953
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:28,380
There better not be a hand in there.

1954
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:32,600
Oh, it's a dead goldfish.

1955
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:35,420
Maybe the fisherman wants it for bait!

1956
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:39,420
Let's try it.

1957
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:44,800
Someone's dead little fish.

1958
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:51,060
He's gone.

1959
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:55,380
Dang it.

1960
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:05,320
Okay.

1961
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:13,880
How do I open the mysterious door?

1962
01:56:15,540 --> 01:56:17,260
Things are already different.

1963
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:20,900
Something in the area has changed.

1964
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,360
Oh, the door!

1965
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:23,820
That must be it.

1966
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:27,360
Yes!

1967
01:56:28,300 --> 01:56:30,200
We have to wait until night time though.

1968
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:31,980
Okay.

1969
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:35,020
What happens if you just garden like you're supposed to?

1970
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:36,880
I...

1971
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:38,640
I don't know.

1972
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:42,140
I...

1973
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,980
From the beginning was just like...

1974
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:48,320
I don't know.

1975
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:52,380
You have to leave to get all the items like...

1976
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:56,260
Like the travel and the...

1977
01:56:56,260 --> 01:56:57,800
And the watering can.

1978
01:56:57,980 --> 01:57:00,580
So you can't just stay in there the whole time.

1979
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:02,420
You have to leave.

1980
01:57:03,700 --> 01:57:05,540
And then you start getting curious.

1981
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:06,880
You know?

1982
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:10,480
When you're curious...

1983
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:11,900
You start investigating.

1984
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:16,020
When you investigate, that's when you discover...

1985
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:18,200
Three dead bodies...

1986
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:21,200
In this town that nobody has noticed.

1987
01:57:21,540 --> 01:57:23,140
Or four, I guess, technically.

1988
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:26,900
And then you say, hmm...

1989
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:29,880
I think something is amiss here.

1990
01:57:30,860 --> 01:57:31,200
You know?

1991
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:33,720
Purple mint is cute.

1992
01:57:34,260 --> 01:57:35,220
Hope everyone has a good day.

1993
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:35,740
You too!

1994
01:57:35,980 --> 01:57:36,860
Thanks, Trashboat.

1995
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:39,660
You have to leave.

1996
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:46,860
Ah!

1997
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:50,900
I found it.

1998
01:57:56,830 --> 01:57:58,430
Found the silly grass.

1999
01:58:03,890 --> 01:58:07,110
I know we have to... Well, I guess...

2000
01:58:10,190 --> 01:58:13,470
There was one thing that was a Sunday night thing, right?

2001
01:58:15,590 --> 01:58:17,790
Oh, and there's also these people!

2002
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:20,030
Oh my gosh.

2003
01:58:21,190 --> 01:58:22,670
We gotta get the compass.

2004
01:58:23,330 --> 01:58:28,970
But then she also had an office key, which makes me think that we would go to the office.

2005
01:58:32,630 --> 01:58:33,970
Church door at midnight.

2006
01:58:34,970 --> 01:58:36,910
We gotta find the church key somehow.

2007
01:58:38,290 --> 01:58:38,810
The bone.

2008
01:58:39,790 --> 01:58:40,330
Fairy.

2009
01:58:42,890 --> 01:58:44,150
Trash, we haven't done yet.

2010
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,280
Maze, we haven't... Oh, I guess these are deaths.

2011
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:53,100
Yeah, we've done these deaths.

2012
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:56,320
The sacred flowers, okay.

2013
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:11,140
Let's just hang around here until we can light the candles, I guess.

2014
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:17,320
We'll just do our duty.

2015
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:19,880
Our lonely duty.

2016
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:23,140
Even though this is...

2017
01:59:23,140 --> 01:59:26,300
For some reason we feel motivated to...

2018
01:59:26,300 --> 01:59:29,760
To garden in some areas and not in others.

2019
01:59:30,280 --> 01:59:31,920
I don't quite understand it.

2020
01:59:32,700 --> 01:59:34,540
Maybe because I'm not a gardener.

2021
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:37,860
I don't have that sense, you know?

2022
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:46,220
I don't have that gardening sense.

2023
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:50,980
Maybe around now?

2024
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:03,360
Yes, okay.

2025
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:06,540
Hello, I would like to buy this compass.

2026
02:00:06,660 --> 02:00:08,480
I have 6F and I need 4.

2027
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:11,260
Thank you!

2028
02:00:13,740 --> 02:00:14,900
Guys, I just remembered.

2029
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:18,080
Where did I get that other plank from?

2030
02:00:21,420 --> 02:00:22,400
The silly grass!

2031
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:23,160
The silly grass!

2032
02:00:29,030 --> 02:00:29,450
Okay.

2033
02:00:33,890 --> 02:00:34,890
Inside the church.

2034
02:00:34,990 --> 02:00:35,670
That's right!

2035
02:00:35,750 --> 02:00:37,110
So we do have to go to the church.

2036
02:00:37,910 --> 02:00:38,550
At midnight.

2037
02:00:39,790 --> 02:00:40,570
Oh my gosh.

2038
02:00:41,350 --> 02:00:42,990
Church door opens at midnight.

2039
02:00:44,430 --> 02:00:45,230
Silly grass!

2040
02:00:50,590 --> 02:00:53,210
I'm purifying all the grass.

2041
02:00:54,290 --> 02:00:55,830
I'm not quite sure what I'm doing.

2042
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:06,140
I guess while we wait, let's garden!

2043
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:12,200
Let's garden while we wait!

2044
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:14,200
Do do do do do...

2045
02:01:37,320 --> 02:01:39,740
Are there any... Can I water these?

2046
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:40,260
No.

2047
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:45,560
Viewers in chat are discussing a bad joke told by Minto.

2048
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:46,780
What did I say?

2049
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:48,000
What are you talking about?

2050
02:01:48,820 --> 02:01:50,000
What bad joke?

2051
02:01:50,620 --> 02:01:51,980
There's only winners here.

2052
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:00,400
Coin?

2053
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:01,640
Where coin?

2054
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:06,960
Where coin?

2055
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:09,620
Werewolf, where coin?

2056
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:15,260
You dug it up and left it.

2057
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:15,540
What?

2058
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:16,420
I did?

2059
02:02:17,680 --> 02:02:18,340
Over here?

2060
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:22,480
Oh my gosh!

2061
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:23,580
Thank you!

2062
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:24,320
I didn't even notice.

2063
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,340
I didn't even know that could happen.

2064
02:02:28,620 --> 02:02:29,220
I'm blind.

2065
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:32,440
Sorry!

2066
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:32,940
Sorry!

2067
02:02:33,220 --> 02:02:33,700
Sorry!

2068
02:02:33,940 --> 02:02:34,420
Sorry!

2069
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:35,320
Sorry!

2070
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:38,560
Sorry, I'm a humble... I'm a humble gardener, please.

2071
02:02:39,420 --> 02:02:39,900
Please.

2072
02:02:41,020 --> 02:02:43,580
Please, give me mercy.

2073
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:45,340
Mercy, mercy.

2074
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:53,660
Oh, they're gonna start jump scaring me soon.

2075
02:02:55,020 --> 02:02:56,940
They're gonna start jump scaring me soon.

2076
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:00,600
How humble are we talking?

2077
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:04,740
Mom, breasts are small and humble.

2078
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:11,960
Shakira levels of humble.

2079
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:15,860
Something mountains.

2080
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:18,340
They're not giant mountains.

2081
02:03:27,880 --> 02:03:31,900
60% I guess a lot of it is over here.

2082
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:34,360
This other side.

2083
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:44,720
I was literally about to... I was literally about to...

2084
02:03:44,720 --> 02:03:45,940
I was literally about to... I was about to say...

2085
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:50,360
I was about to say I'm surprised we haven't been jump scared yet.

2086
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:51,700
Oh my God.

2087
02:03:52,660 --> 02:03:54,500
I couldn't even speak right.

2088
02:03:56,960 --> 02:03:58,320
It got me good.

2089
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:01,380
Cannot see the bottom.

2090
02:04:02,140 --> 02:04:03,440
It won't let me in there.

2091
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:06,260
Oh, we have to find the... Wait, where was the paddle?

2092
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:20,260
I feel like I recognize this, but...

2093
02:04:24,510 --> 02:04:26,770
I feel like I recognize these sticks.

2094
02:04:30,510 --> 02:04:34,290
Music is so chill for what is definitely not a chill area.

2095
02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:36,370
Or chill time of the day.

2096
02:04:43,690 --> 02:04:45,030
No jump scare, please.

2097
02:04:45,650 --> 02:04:46,950
No jump scare, please.

2098
02:04:47,770 --> 02:04:49,190
No jump scare, please.

2099
02:04:52,150 --> 02:04:53,450
I'm doing my job.

2100
02:04:53,510 --> 02:04:55,730
I'm a humble gardener.

2101
02:04:59,330 --> 02:05:01,930
When will it say that we've cut all the grass?

2102
02:05:05,050 --> 02:05:05,570
God.

2103
02:05:07,490 --> 02:05:08,510
Oh my goodness.

2104
02:05:08,570 --> 02:05:09,950
It gets me every time.

2105
02:05:09,950 --> 02:05:10,450
Time.

2106
02:05:15,290 --> 02:05:16,050
Time to go to bed.

2107
02:05:16,250 --> 02:05:17,190
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2108
02:05:17,390 --> 02:05:18,430
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

2109
02:05:19,370 --> 02:05:20,530
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

2110
02:05:21,550 --> 02:05:22,370
Good, good, good, good.

2111
02:05:22,910 --> 02:05:23,550
Knock, knock.

2112
02:05:25,570 --> 02:05:25,850
Okay.

2113
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:33,860
Okay, shut tight.

2114
02:05:38,620 --> 02:05:40,520
Do you think I can make it through the maze?

2115
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:45,700
Oh my God, I hear him talking, the gnome.

2116
02:05:51,380 --> 02:05:54,300
You enter the maze with a confident feeling.

2117
02:06:01,540 --> 02:06:03,560
But it's really dark in here.

2118
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:04,160
I'm leaving.

2119
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:07,320
It's really dark.

2120
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:08,720
I think we should come back.

2121
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,800
Strange happenings are about to happen.

2122
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:17,480
Oh, like the radio on and stuff.

2123
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:18,400
What?

2124
02:06:18,580 --> 02:06:19,840
Oh my God, you again.

2125
02:06:20,740 --> 02:06:22,340
With your stupid ass hand.

2126
02:06:22,340 --> 02:06:25,060
Stop leaving me presents.

2127
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:26,440
See?

2128
02:06:26,620 --> 02:06:29,220
Oh, this is what I recognized the sticks from.

2129
02:06:30,440 --> 02:06:31,820
But there is no paddle.

2130
02:06:36,250 --> 02:06:36,510
Okay.

2131
02:06:42,050 --> 02:06:42,890
Alright.

2132
02:06:46,790 --> 02:06:48,410
Have confidence.

2133
02:06:49,730 --> 02:06:50,550
This way.

2134
02:06:51,830 --> 02:06:52,650
This way.

2135
02:06:53,610 --> 02:06:57,890
Wait, this is an actual maze now.

2136
02:06:58,250 --> 02:06:58,490
Wait.

2137
02:06:59,350 --> 02:07:00,770
Hold on.

2138
02:07:02,370 --> 02:07:05,390
I was just messing around for a second.

2139
02:07:05,770 --> 02:07:07,150
It's an actual maze now.

2140
02:07:08,170 --> 02:07:09,230
Okay, hold on.

2141
02:07:10,670 --> 02:07:11,350
Okay, hold on.

2142
02:07:14,910 --> 02:07:17,430
It's a delicate looking fountain.

2143
02:07:20,970 --> 02:07:23,590
It seems to be unaware of your presence.

2144
02:07:24,570 --> 02:07:27,990
He looks like he's a soldier.

2145
02:07:28,270 --> 02:07:29,450
Like he looks like he's...

2146
02:07:30,070 --> 02:07:31,310
Can you use the compass?

2147
02:07:31,450 --> 02:07:32,290
I don't think so.

2148
02:07:33,170 --> 02:07:33,370
Wait.

2149
02:07:34,050 --> 02:07:35,950
I think it just allowed us to...

2150
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:37,830
Prevents you from getting lost.

2151
02:07:38,350 --> 02:07:41,690
I think it just allows us to go through the... to actually do the maze.

2152
02:07:43,790 --> 02:07:45,550
Graveyards are actually the least haunted place.

2153
02:07:45,550 --> 02:07:48,910
As very rarely if anybody dies in a graveyard.

2154
02:07:50,690 --> 02:07:53,130
Oh, we have a ghost expert over here.

2155
02:07:54,410 --> 02:07:57,170
What do you mean prevents you from getting lost?

2156
02:07:57,250 --> 02:07:58,310
Wait, this is where I came from.

2157
02:07:58,930 --> 02:08:00,470
It did prevent me from getting lost.

2158
02:08:00,590 --> 02:08:01,210
Okay, hold on.

2159
02:08:03,350 --> 02:08:05,010
Can we do anything to the fountain?

2160
02:08:06,230 --> 02:08:07,590
Maybe I should have smashed it.

2161
02:08:10,630 --> 02:08:12,950
Checking out if there is anything else in here though.

2162
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:26,660
Prevents you from getting lost.

2163
02:08:27,620 --> 02:08:29,820
Those words keep ringing in my head.

2164
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:31,880
Prevents you from getting lost.

2165
02:08:39,380 --> 02:08:40,060
Delicate.

2166
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:41,060
If it's delicate.

2167
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:46,420
Not smashable.

2168
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:48,400
Cuttable?

2169
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:48,960
No.

2170
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:50,680
Dickable?

2171
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:51,360
No.

2172
02:08:54,900 --> 02:08:55,620
Nothing.

2173
02:08:56,580 --> 02:08:59,200
I can't even like throw a coin in there.

2174
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:04,640
Maybe we are missing another part of the maze puzzle.

2175
02:09:05,300 --> 02:09:07,080
That's a little frustrating.

2176
02:09:17,150 --> 02:09:19,270
How much money do I have?

2177
02:09:20,630 --> 02:09:21,750
Doesn't say.

2178
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:36,640
Oh my gosh, I never...

2179
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:39,200
I never went and got the other plank.

2180
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:41,060
How silly of me.

2181
02:09:41,420 --> 02:09:43,600
Here, let's do some gardening while we are here.

2182
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:48,760
Let's get some of these mole hills.

2183
02:09:55,740 --> 02:09:59,600
Don't make a mountain out of a mole hill.

2184
02:10:01,640 --> 02:10:02,800
Oh, there is trash in here.

2185
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:05,840
Trash.

2186
02:10:12,290 --> 02:10:16,130
Oh, and we can also...

2187
02:10:16,130 --> 02:10:18,390
Water, water, water, water, water.

2188
02:10:20,190 --> 02:10:21,550
Thanks for the super chat.

2189
02:10:21,870 --> 02:10:22,750
What is this game?

2190
02:10:23,510 --> 02:10:27,690
It's actually pretty intriguing I'd say.

2191
02:10:31,590 --> 02:10:33,990
I think it really...

2192
02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:34,690
It's like...

2193
02:10:35,250 --> 02:10:37,950
Feels fast paced enough to kind of like keep your energy...

2194
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:39,690
Or your attention, you know?

2195
02:10:40,210 --> 02:10:42,690
But it's also mysterious enough that I...

2196
02:10:44,430 --> 02:10:45,570
Can't stop.

2197
02:10:53,330 --> 02:10:56,150
I didn't get all the trash, I don't think.

2198
02:10:56,150 --> 02:10:58,690
I don't know where all the trash is at.

2199
02:11:02,010 --> 02:11:02,950
Mysterious flower.

2200
02:11:05,350 --> 02:11:06,470
Did I get all of them?

2201
02:11:06,770 --> 02:11:07,270
Oh wait, no.

2202
02:11:08,690 --> 02:11:10,270
Oh, I watered all the flowers.

2203
02:11:11,350 --> 02:11:14,250
Oh my gosh, we are at 96% you guys.

2204
02:11:16,150 --> 02:11:17,430
Maybe it is possible.

2205
02:11:18,830 --> 02:11:19,350
Maybe.

2206
02:11:20,210 --> 02:11:21,830
Maybe it is possible.

2207
02:11:22,070 --> 02:11:28,310
97% Wait, something was...

2208
02:11:31,350 --> 02:11:34,310
It's a normal garden gnome.

2209
02:11:39,890 --> 02:11:41,590
He was not there before.

2210
02:11:44,590 --> 02:11:46,130
I saw him move.

2211
02:11:46,190 --> 02:11:48,190
I saw him move in my peripheral.

2212
02:11:50,670 --> 02:11:51,910
Is it this guy?

2213
02:11:54,350 --> 02:11:54,990
He moved!

2214
02:11:55,450 --> 02:11:56,510
Oh my god, he moved.

2215
02:12:00,670 --> 02:12:01,830
Do you think he is after me?

2216
02:12:04,270 --> 02:12:06,630
I wish this was also like... What is it called?

2217
02:12:11,870 --> 02:12:13,350
Oh my gosh, I cleared all the trash.

2218
02:12:13,630 --> 02:12:14,610
I didn't even notice that.

2219
02:12:14,870 --> 02:12:17,870
I wish this was a little bit like...

2220
02:12:19,770 --> 02:12:24,570
Power wash simulator where I could click and find what areas I've missed.

2221
02:12:26,850 --> 02:12:29,110
I reached 100% in the garden.

2222
02:12:29,290 --> 02:12:30,450
Wait, a mysterious pass?

2223
02:12:30,610 --> 02:12:32,290
Oh my gosh, what is this?

2224
02:12:32,770 --> 02:12:33,730
Can I fit through here?

2225
02:12:33,970 --> 02:12:34,690
Skinny legend?

2226
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:41,780
The perfect place for a picnic.

2227
02:12:48,420 --> 02:12:49,380
Okay.

2228
02:12:52,420 --> 02:12:54,420
Normal garden gnome.

2229
02:12:56,580 --> 02:12:59,280
I'm skinny legend, everybody.

2230
02:13:02,780 --> 02:13:06,380
When I say I'm dieting, this is what I mean.

2231
02:13:06,380 --> 02:13:06,440
What am I doing?

2232
02:13:15,100 --> 02:13:16,940
Oh, this stays open.

2233
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:22,080
It requires a key and a shut tight.

2234
02:13:25,240 --> 02:13:27,580
We still haven't gotten the paddle.

2235
02:13:27,860 --> 02:13:29,260
I still don't know where that is.

2236
02:13:29,260 --> 02:13:29,300
What is this?

2237
02:13:34,780 --> 02:13:37,740
Are there any flowers to water in here?

2238
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:40,460
Doesn't seem like it.

2239
02:13:40,520 --> 02:13:42,300
I'm trying to like 100% this area.

2240
02:13:42,740 --> 02:13:43,720
Is that trash?

2241
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:44,040
No.

2242
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:50,260
I'm trying 100% this area so I can...

2243
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:53,060
I'm scared of cutting these on accident.

2244
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:59,060
Because if a portal appears every time you 100% an area...

2245
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:06,480
And it says we need a picnic, maybe we gather the supplies for a picnic in the other areas.

2246
02:14:07,480 --> 02:14:09,400
Perhaps is my hypothesis.

2247
02:14:13,900 --> 02:14:16,640
The polaroid for the paddle said 830.

2248
02:14:16,900 --> 02:14:18,980
Oh, 830.

2249
02:14:18,980 --> 02:14:19,640
830.

2250
02:14:22,220 --> 02:14:22,720
PM?

2251
02:14:26,240 --> 02:14:26,740
AM?

2252
02:14:28,260 --> 02:14:29,300
Did I miss it?

2253
02:14:31,420 --> 02:14:32,140
Water these?

2254
02:14:32,300 --> 02:14:32,900
Oh, yes.

2255
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:33,520
Thank you.

2256
02:14:36,360 --> 02:14:37,200
I missed it.

2257
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:38,040
I didn't see these.

2258
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:41,000
Very good, very good.

2259
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:41,820
Can I water here?

2260
02:14:42,680 --> 02:14:43,100
No.

2261
02:14:45,080 --> 02:14:46,500
Can I jump in there?

2262
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:49,080
Who cares if I can't see the bottom.

2263
02:14:52,240 --> 02:14:53,780
I think we did it.

2264
02:14:54,080 --> 02:14:54,700
100%!

2265
02:14:55,060 --> 02:14:56,900
I didn't get an achievement this time though.

2266
02:14:57,440 --> 02:14:58,280
Secret passage?

2267
02:15:00,380 --> 02:15:01,660
Secret passageway.

2268
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:04,580
Secret passageway!

2269
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:10,660
Ignore the big pieces of grass.

2270
02:15:10,760 --> 02:15:11,200
Oh, there it is!

2271
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:18,940
What?

2272
02:15:24,060 --> 02:15:24,500
Steel!

2273
02:15:25,560 --> 02:15:26,620
I got the cute blanket.

2274
02:15:26,740 --> 02:15:27,980
Now run before somebody kills me.

2275
02:15:32,540 --> 02:15:33,560
We got the blanket.

2276
02:15:33,860 --> 02:15:34,700
A blanket for a picnic!

2277
02:15:36,740 --> 02:15:40,680
Let's go try and 100% the park now.

2278
02:15:41,620 --> 02:15:42,160
I suppose.

2279
02:15:44,040 --> 02:15:46,060
Is our... How much do I have of here?

2280
02:15:46,140 --> 02:15:46,840
Oh, we are at 63.

2281
02:15:46,840 --> 02:15:48,520
This is possibly doable.

2282
02:15:49,060 --> 02:15:52,480
Sorry children, I don't care about your instruments and your happiness.

2283
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:57,040
I don't care about you and your little stupid recital.

2284
02:15:57,580 --> 02:15:59,820
You sound like Dookie anyway.

2285
02:16:00,700 --> 02:16:03,940
I'm a better trumpet player than that girl will ever be.

2286
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:06,580
Is there anything here?

2287
02:16:07,080 --> 02:16:07,360
Money!

2288
02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:15,060
I'm a gardener, but I was born for the stage.

2289
02:16:15,060 --> 02:16:21,960
I'm a gardener, but I always had a passion for trumpet.

2290
02:16:23,420 --> 02:16:28,160
I'm a gardener, but my parents forced me into the family biz.

2291
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:35,620
I always wanted to be a trumpet player.

2292
02:16:35,620 --> 02:16:40,280
What my parents said.

2293
02:16:41,940 --> 02:16:42,740
You dummy.

2294
02:16:43,640 --> 02:16:45,660
You were born into this family.

2295
02:16:46,740 --> 02:16:48,640
Oh my gosh, that reminds me actually.

2296
02:16:49,340 --> 02:16:52,160
I recently watched Coco for the first time.

2297
02:16:52,620 --> 02:16:53,980
The movie.

2298
02:16:54,940 --> 02:16:56,500
Remember me.

2299
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:00,780
I'm a something, something, something.

2300
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:01,900
Remember me.

2301
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:05,920
I kind of had an issue with the movie.

2302
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:06,680
I'm not gonna lie.

2303
02:17:07,160 --> 02:17:08,400
I liked it, obviously.

2304
02:17:08,600 --> 02:17:09,420
It was very cute.

2305
02:17:09,540 --> 02:17:10,220
I liked it.

2306
02:17:11,140 --> 02:17:13,320
But I kind of...

2307
02:17:13,320 --> 02:17:15,220
And maybe this is just my...

2308
02:17:15,220 --> 02:17:21,620
This is obviously not everybody's experience in life or afterlife.

2309
02:17:23,060 --> 02:17:24,900
But I kind of...

2310
02:17:28,540 --> 02:17:29,460
Felt like...

2311
02:17:29,460 --> 02:17:31,180
A little weird about how they...

2312
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:32,740
So...

2313
02:17:32,740 --> 02:17:34,900
Much they were like...

2314
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:36,760
Oh, you know.

2315
02:17:37,480 --> 02:17:38,080
Your family.

2316
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:39,640
Your family is everything.

2317
02:17:39,900 --> 02:17:40,720
Your family, family.

2318
02:17:41,660 --> 02:17:43,060
But like, whatever, you know.

2319
02:17:43,400 --> 02:17:45,900
I feel like it would be really sad if someone...

2320
02:17:46,640 --> 02:17:48,300
Didn't have a good family.

2321
02:17:53,380 --> 02:17:53,840
And...

2322
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:54,780
Like, watch that.

2323
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:55,360
It was just like...

2324
02:17:55,360 --> 02:17:56,960
How am I supposed to feel?

2325
02:17:57,240 --> 02:17:59,320
So when I die, I'm just gonna...

2326
02:17:59,780 --> 02:18:01,220
I'm just gonna...

2327
02:18:02,220 --> 02:18:04,600
I'm gonna disappear because, you know.

2328
02:18:04,740 --> 02:18:07,780
I don't have a family to put on my little photo or whatever.

2329
02:18:08,360 --> 02:18:09,840
I just felt kind of like...

2330
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:13,120
They really went fast and furious.

2331
02:18:15,060 --> 02:18:15,740
I don't know.

2332
02:18:15,800 --> 02:18:17,320
That was my only thing about it.

2333
02:18:17,360 --> 02:18:17,860
Because, you know.

2334
02:18:20,040 --> 02:18:20,480
Um...

2335
02:18:22,120 --> 02:18:22,560
Yeah.

2336
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:25,720
Okay.

2337
02:18:25,900 --> 02:18:26,420
What else?

2338
02:18:26,560 --> 02:18:28,300
Is there any more flowers to water?

2339
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:30,680
More grasses to cut.

2340
02:18:32,020 --> 02:18:34,500
But I really liked it, other than that.

2341
02:18:35,740 --> 02:18:37,860
That was like, like I said, my only...

2342
02:18:38,520 --> 02:18:40,220
It's not even like a big problem.

2343
02:18:40,500 --> 02:18:41,700
It's just something that I was just like...

2344
02:18:41,700 --> 02:18:42,140
Oh, huh.

2345
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:42,500
Okay.

2346
02:18:42,500 --> 02:18:42,600
Okay.

2347
02:18:50,380 --> 02:18:52,020
Not water these.

2348
02:18:52,720 --> 02:18:54,000
We're at 94%.

2349
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:54,680
What are we missing?

2350
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:02,640
Have you guys seen anything we need to water?

2351
02:19:03,340 --> 02:19:06,120
Metal Gear Solid teaches us that family doesn't have to be genetically related.

2352
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:09,540
Family can be your brother's arm attached to it that loves your dad.

2353
02:19:09,900 --> 02:19:11,340
So true!

2354
02:19:14,600 --> 02:19:16,140
I missed a molehill?

2355
02:19:17,380 --> 02:19:18,400
I did?

2356
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:20,580
Little molehill.

2357
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:22,780
Little molehill.

2358
02:19:22,980 --> 02:19:23,100
Where?

2359
02:19:26,460 --> 02:19:27,920
Where is the molehill?

2360
02:19:33,620 --> 02:19:35,100
I did?

2361
02:19:38,100 --> 02:19:39,420
Something fell out!

2362
02:19:39,660 --> 02:19:41,300
Oh my god, I just robbed the tree.

2363
02:19:44,580 --> 02:19:46,500
Oh, there, there, there, thank you.

2364
02:19:49,780 --> 02:19:52,320
But we're only at 95%.

2365
02:19:52,940 --> 02:19:54,880
And it's getting late.

2366
02:19:55,800 --> 02:19:56,860
Uh-oh, guys.

2367
02:19:59,940 --> 02:20:01,580
What else am I missing in here?

2368
02:20:05,740 --> 02:20:06,560
These guys.

2369
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:10,600
You cannot make out what they say.

2370
02:20:11,180 --> 02:20:12,000
Can I take your stuff?

2371
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,320
I got a pizza box.

2372
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:19,420
Can I take your car?

2373
02:20:20,240 --> 02:20:21,180
Slick scooter.

2374
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:23,920
Okay.

2375
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:27,120
Water everything.

2376
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:35,060
All I did was water these.

2377
02:20:35,620 --> 02:20:37,360
And those flowers over there.

2378
02:20:37,820 --> 02:20:39,340
What am I missing in here?

2379
02:20:39,340 --> 02:20:41,360
I can't tell.

2380
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:43,320
I've gotten like most of the grass, I feel.

2381
02:20:51,560 --> 02:20:54,400
Usually it's very easy to tell if you need to water it.

2382
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:56,420
The ladder.

2383
02:20:57,620 --> 02:20:58,960
What, you think I have to go upstairs?

2384
02:21:03,470 --> 02:21:03,810
No.

2385
02:21:05,250 --> 02:21:06,690
I don't think I need to go back there.

2386
02:21:08,270 --> 02:21:09,310
I haven't checked in a while.

2387
02:21:09,370 --> 02:21:10,230
Any update with the plush?

2388
02:21:10,230 --> 02:21:11,270
They are in production.

2389
02:21:13,270 --> 02:21:14,870
They are in production.

2390
02:21:18,430 --> 02:21:20,890
Sorry I can't say much more than that.

2391
02:21:21,050 --> 02:21:22,310
Oh, in here, in here.

2392
02:21:22,810 --> 02:21:23,450
Oh my gosh.

2393
02:21:29,810 --> 02:21:32,070
100% progress in all areas.

2394
02:21:32,790 --> 02:21:34,570
It says Master Gardener.

2395
02:21:38,510 --> 02:21:39,470
A sandwich.

2396
02:21:40,210 --> 02:21:41,150
What are these?

2397
02:21:41,490 --> 02:21:42,650
A bunch of bread.

2398
02:21:44,210 --> 02:21:47,030
They sell normal bread and long bread.

2399
02:21:48,090 --> 02:21:49,010
Hello, yes?

2400
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:52,970
I would like one long bread.

2401
02:21:53,450 --> 02:21:55,490
It all looks quite fresh.

2402
02:21:58,630 --> 02:22:00,750
Nobody cares that I stole, right?

2403
02:22:04,150 --> 02:22:07,210
Will the plush have a nifty light stick hole at the bottom?

2404
02:22:09,690 --> 02:22:10,290
No.

2405
02:22:12,390 --> 02:22:15,450
But, you could make your own hole.

2406
02:22:17,550 --> 02:22:19,570
I don't recommend it.

2407
02:22:20,790 --> 02:22:23,290
If you would like to have a hole...

2408
02:22:24,330 --> 02:22:25,670
Wait, where is the hole here?

2409
02:22:25,810 --> 02:22:26,230
Oh, over here.

2410
02:22:26,630 --> 02:22:28,290
If you would like...

2411
02:22:29,930 --> 02:22:32,690
You should buy multiple.

2412
02:22:35,470 --> 02:22:36,790
Okay, lay down the blanket.

2413
02:22:38,090 --> 02:22:39,250
I put the sandwich on the blanket.

2414
02:22:40,290 --> 02:22:41,150
And we picnic!

2415
02:22:42,230 --> 02:22:42,790
Oh my gosh.

2416
02:23:13,090 --> 02:23:14,870
I did so much.

2417
02:23:15,770 --> 02:23:17,510
Is there a point to tending the garden?

2418
02:23:20,790 --> 02:23:21,450
Did you die?

2419
02:23:21,570 --> 02:23:23,010
What if I choked on the sandwich?

2420
02:23:23,110 --> 02:23:23,950
It was poisoned.

2421
02:23:25,290 --> 02:23:26,590
Because I stole it.

2422
02:23:32,170 --> 02:23:33,010
She is a thief.

2423
02:23:34,930 --> 02:23:36,330
I didn't know there was a plush.

2424
02:23:36,410 --> 02:23:37,210
There will be one.

2425
02:23:37,210 --> 02:23:39,390
I won't shut up about it.

2426
02:23:40,430 --> 02:23:43,950
If you follow me on Twitter, you've seen the plush.

2427
02:23:46,930 --> 02:23:50,290
I didn't die though, because I didn't see that guy.

2428
02:23:57,170 --> 02:23:57,770
20?

2429
02:23:57,910 --> 02:23:58,810
There is still...

2430
02:23:58,810 --> 02:24:03,030
There is still 20 more areas we haven't been to.

2431
02:24:04,530 --> 02:24:05,130
What?

2432
02:24:05,130 --> 02:24:05,170
What?

2433
02:24:12,720 --> 02:24:14,260
Wait, we've almost met...

2434
02:24:14,260 --> 02:24:17,560
It says characters met 17 out of 18.

2435
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:20,340
We've almost met every character.

2436
02:24:20,880 --> 02:24:21,380
Interesting.

2437
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:22,880
Okay.

2438
02:24:24,020 --> 02:24:25,780
I feel like there is...

2439
02:24:25,780 --> 02:24:27,640
Probably need to get that ore at 830.

2440
02:24:27,820 --> 02:24:28,420
Probably.

2441
02:24:33,980 --> 02:24:34,640
Probably.

2442
02:24:34,640 --> 02:24:34,940
Probably.

2443
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:39,880
Will you ever do additional production runs if there is more demand?

2444
02:24:39,980 --> 02:24:42,100
Or do we just have to wait and see what the future holds?

2445
02:24:45,480 --> 02:24:47,300
At the moment...

2446
02:24:47,300 --> 02:24:49,980
I don't have any other plans.

2447
02:24:51,880 --> 02:24:53,400
But I would never say never.

2448
02:24:55,300 --> 02:24:56,740
Wait, why is he here?

2449
02:24:57,080 --> 02:24:58,440
Instead of all the way over here.

2450
02:25:03,570 --> 02:25:05,250
He is permanently moved.

2451
02:25:05,250 --> 02:25:07,150
Our little gnome.

2452
02:25:07,690 --> 02:25:08,330
Interesting.

2453
02:25:11,670 --> 02:25:12,950
See, we have so much.

2454
02:25:13,030 --> 02:25:13,730
We have the plate.

2455
02:25:17,050 --> 02:25:19,250
There is still so much to...

2456
02:25:20,570 --> 02:25:21,730
To investigate.

2457
02:25:23,370 --> 02:25:24,850
There is the gnomes.

2458
02:25:25,370 --> 02:25:26,790
All the gnomes.

2459
02:25:27,970 --> 02:25:30,710
He is slowly encroaching on the starting zone.

2460
02:25:31,550 --> 02:25:33,230
I don't like his whispers.

2461
02:25:36,270 --> 02:25:37,470
Oh, let's go.

2462
02:25:37,650 --> 02:25:37,850
Sorry.

2463
02:25:39,470 --> 02:25:42,350
I'm not even going to bother...

2464
02:25:42,910 --> 02:25:44,390
Being a gardener anymore.

2465
02:25:44,570 --> 02:25:47,090
Because there is no point in gardening.

2466
02:25:47,470 --> 02:25:48,070
I've learned.

2467
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:55,380
3, 2, 1, jump scare!

2468
02:26:01,980 --> 02:26:03,260
Gardening gives you money though?

2469
02:26:03,380 --> 02:26:04,040
Wait, it does?

2470
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:06,280
I'm gardening?

2471
02:26:10,480 --> 02:26:11,100
I'm gardening?

2472
02:26:13,340 --> 02:26:14,740
Self-fulfillment?

2473
02:26:17,360 --> 02:26:25,140
Yeah, I felt really good getting 100% in all 3 areas.

2474
02:26:25,240 --> 02:26:25,680
I did!

2475
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:28,100
I did!

2476
02:26:28,840 --> 02:26:30,860
I felt really good about myself.

2477
02:26:31,420 --> 02:26:33,780
I'm not going to lie, I was just like, yeah!

2478
02:26:34,600 --> 02:26:35,720
I did it!

2479
02:26:38,820 --> 02:26:40,160
I was like, woohoo!

2480
02:26:40,820 --> 02:26:42,260
I'm really good at this.

2481
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:45,260
I'm really good at this job.

2482
02:26:47,100 --> 02:26:48,720
Wait, how does it give you money?

2483
02:26:50,940 --> 02:26:53,200
You just need the molehills for the easy money.

2484
02:26:55,220 --> 02:26:56,620
When does this open up?

2485
02:26:58,220 --> 02:26:59,380
What do you mean?

2486
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:03,080
Why are you acting like you are a professional at this game?

2487
02:27:05,720 --> 02:27:06,380
Okay.

2488
02:27:13,390 --> 02:27:16,730
We still have the...

2489
02:27:17,510 --> 02:27:19,430
The office key?

2490
02:27:19,530 --> 02:27:19,710
Okay.

2491
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:25,510
I just realized...

2492
02:27:27,330 --> 02:27:29,570
Guys, I think I'm going to restart.

2493
02:27:29,850 --> 02:27:34,370
Wait, where do we get the ore tomorrow?

2494
02:27:35,350 --> 02:27:36,250
Hold on.

2495
02:27:37,930 --> 02:27:40,410
Is it 8.30 PM or AM?

2496
02:27:40,610 --> 02:27:42,030
No, it's got to be AM.

2497
02:27:42,510 --> 02:27:44,610
It's 8.30 AM that you get the ore.

2498
02:27:48,050 --> 02:27:50,730
But where is the paddle?

2499
02:27:53,510 --> 02:27:55,170
Yeah, it's a 24 hour clock.

2500
02:27:55,690 --> 02:27:57,710
But where is this?

2501
02:28:01,410 --> 02:28:02,830
Is it where I think it is?

2502
02:28:02,930 --> 02:28:05,090
Is it this little... And this guy here too.

2503
02:28:05,090 --> 02:28:06,410
So mysterious.

2504
02:28:06,590 --> 02:28:11,510
There's like certain people that just show up and disappear at the most random times.

2505
02:28:16,530 --> 02:28:18,270
It's not here, I don't think.

2506
02:28:19,130 --> 02:28:19,470
No.

2507
02:28:20,730 --> 02:28:21,770
Backside of the shack?

2508
02:28:21,930 --> 02:28:23,250
Oh, it will be here.

2509
02:28:23,590 --> 02:28:23,770
Okay.

2510
02:28:25,270 --> 02:28:26,310
Guys... Oh, money.

2511
02:28:26,870 --> 02:28:27,890
8.30 AM.

2512
02:28:28,150 --> 02:28:29,230
Okay, tomorrow morning.

2513
02:28:30,950 --> 02:28:32,250
I should have gotten it.

2514
02:28:33,430 --> 02:28:34,290
Ah, should I restart?

2515
02:28:34,290 --> 02:28:34,550
Restart!

2516
02:28:36,690 --> 02:28:38,550
It's only 10.30, should I restart?

2517
02:28:38,890 --> 02:28:39,970
What time do we get here?

2518
02:28:40,950 --> 02:28:43,090
At 9 or do we get here at 8?

2519
02:28:49,630 --> 02:28:54,390
Let's continue seeing what other things we can solve before we...

2520
02:28:55,650 --> 02:28:57,350
Like the silly grass.

2521
02:29:00,390 --> 02:29:04,650
Let's see what other things we can solve before we... We can still get tomorrow.

2522
02:29:05,050 --> 02:29:05,930
Just have to remember.

2523
02:29:06,830 --> 02:29:07,770
First thing in the morning.

2524
02:29:08,550 --> 02:29:09,390
Behind the shack.

2525
02:29:12,010 --> 02:29:12,950
Alright, door handle!

2526
02:29:15,190 --> 02:29:15,730
Perfect.

2527
02:29:20,190 --> 02:29:21,870
Jump scare in 3, 2, 1!

2528
02:29:24,730 --> 02:29:25,650
The snail!

2529
02:29:31,830 --> 02:29:33,150
Oh, calm down.

2530
02:29:33,150 --> 02:29:34,150
Chill out.

2531
02:29:34,570 --> 02:29:35,410
Okay, nevermind.

2532
02:29:35,630 --> 02:29:36,090
Thank you.

2533
02:29:39,290 --> 02:29:41,070
Party grass better have some good lore.

2534
02:29:41,230 --> 02:29:41,770
I know!

2535
02:29:42,690 --> 02:29:43,910
That's what I'm saying.

2536
02:29:45,750 --> 02:29:47,710
And then there is this lady in here?

2537
02:29:49,050 --> 02:29:49,750
You know what?

2538
02:29:49,770 --> 02:29:50,890
I am gonna kill the gnome.

2539
02:29:51,910 --> 02:29:53,990
I'm gonna kill the gnome and see what happens.

2540
02:30:01,260 --> 02:30:02,740
Don't kill the gnome.

2541
02:30:03,820 --> 02:30:04,540
Why not?

2542
02:30:08,430 --> 02:30:08,870
Why not?

2543
02:30:08,950 --> 02:30:10,270
What has he done for me ever?

2544
02:30:11,630 --> 02:30:12,750
Okay, I have 3 F.

2545
02:30:15,410 --> 02:30:16,810
Steal their idol.

2546
02:30:19,410 --> 02:30:23,090
And then there is the couple playing mahjong or whatever.

2547
02:30:27,990 --> 02:30:28,590
Money?

2548
02:30:35,890 --> 02:30:38,350
I still always wanna pick up the garbage though.

2549
02:30:40,950 --> 02:30:41,450
Alright.

2550
02:30:42,250 --> 02:30:43,270
There is also the corn?

2551
02:30:43,410 --> 02:30:44,370
Yes, there is the corn.

2552
02:30:44,810 --> 02:30:47,150
I tried putting it on the plate and it didn't work.

2553
02:30:48,270 --> 02:30:49,670
So I wonder...

2554
02:30:50,350 --> 02:30:52,290
What the corn is for?

2555
02:30:55,090 --> 02:30:56,670
Like you would think...

2556
02:30:59,910 --> 02:31:00,910
It's for...

2557
02:31:00,910 --> 02:31:01,490
Okay, bye.

2558
02:31:02,290 --> 02:31:04,490
You would think it's for...

2559
02:31:07,790 --> 02:31:08,510
Eating?

2560
02:31:09,910 --> 02:31:10,710
Don't show it.

2561
02:31:17,340 --> 02:31:19,260
For the maze?

2562
02:31:25,950 --> 02:31:28,010
You are killing me.

2563
02:31:29,390 --> 02:31:30,490
I'm already dead.

2564
02:31:31,990 --> 02:31:32,530
That's right.

2565
02:31:32,570 --> 02:31:33,690
What if I water these?

2566
02:31:34,690 --> 02:31:35,410
Inspect.

2567
02:31:35,410 --> 02:31:37,350
Oh, that's an empty mailbox.

2568
02:31:40,710 --> 02:31:42,870
Let's go give the boat to the...

2569
02:31:42,870 --> 02:31:44,550
The fairy to the...

2570
02:31:44,550 --> 02:31:46,530
The boat toy to the fairy kids.

2571
02:31:50,790 --> 02:31:54,580
I feel like there is still so much that we have not...

2572
02:31:56,210 --> 02:31:56,750
Done.

2573
02:31:57,050 --> 02:31:57,580
There is just...

2574
02:31:58,090 --> 02:31:59,310
An insane amount.

2575
02:32:01,330 --> 02:32:04,410
If I try to steal the gnomes' idols when they are alive...

2576
02:32:05,410 --> 02:32:07,390
Will they be upset by that?

2577
02:32:16,610 --> 02:32:18,650
There you go.

2578
02:32:20,690 --> 02:32:21,910
I'm so angry!

2579
02:32:24,050 --> 02:32:25,330
Wasn't there money in here?

2580
02:32:26,290 --> 02:32:26,950
I'm robbing.

2581
02:32:29,570 --> 02:32:32,730
Why does it sound like I'm not wearing shoes?

2582
02:32:34,550 --> 02:32:36,110
He looks so mad.

2583
02:32:38,230 --> 02:32:39,990
Does that one molehill still have a lighter?

2584
02:32:40,630 --> 02:32:42,370
Let's go check.

2585
02:32:44,150 --> 02:32:48,030
Let's go see if it does or not.

2586
02:32:53,430 --> 02:32:56,510
I wonder if it...

2587
02:32:56,510 --> 02:32:57,790
Has a lighter.

2588
02:32:58,730 --> 02:32:59,470
Or if it...

2589
02:32:59,470 --> 02:33:03,430
I wonder if the lighter will be in the park if you don't get it from there.

2590
02:33:03,610 --> 02:33:04,450
And you don't buy it.

2591
02:33:12,350 --> 02:33:12,910
Shofi?

2592
02:33:14,070 --> 02:33:15,210
I don't have any.

2593
02:33:17,530 --> 02:33:18,430
This guy.

2594
02:33:18,570 --> 02:33:19,390
Oh yeah, that's right.

2595
02:33:19,730 --> 02:33:21,190
Do you want the dead goldfish?

2596
02:33:22,770 --> 02:33:24,230
I can get it for you.

2597
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:28,780
He's still there.

2598
02:33:28,860 --> 02:33:29,600
He's still there.

2599
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:31,100
Don't go anywhere mister.

2600
02:33:31,300 --> 02:33:32,620
I'm watching you.

2601
02:33:33,320 --> 02:33:34,620
I'm watching you.

2602
02:33:42,830 --> 02:33:43,470
Fishbowl?

2603
02:33:44,330 --> 02:33:47,250
There was the fishbowl!

2604
02:33:47,750 --> 02:33:49,030
That's right.

2605
02:33:49,470 --> 02:33:51,150
Wait, how did we get into there?

2606
02:33:54,710 --> 02:33:58,390
How did we get into where the fishbowl was?

2607
02:34:00,210 --> 02:34:01,510
Hold on, he's still here.

2608
02:34:01,530 --> 02:34:02,170
I can ask him.

2609
02:34:03,010 --> 02:34:03,630
Hey mister!

2610
02:34:03,630 --> 02:34:03,650
Mister!

2611
02:34:09,150 --> 02:34:10,630
The gnomes!

2612
02:34:12,130 --> 02:34:13,490
Wait, do I actually...

2613
02:34:13,490 --> 02:34:14,350
Wait, the gnome cave.

2614
02:34:15,510 --> 02:34:17,870
This game is so much.

2615
02:34:24,220 --> 02:34:25,010
Give me money!

2616
02:34:26,410 --> 02:34:27,310
No tip?

2617
02:34:30,170 --> 02:34:31,570
It's dark in here.

2618
02:34:32,850 --> 02:34:35,570
You look out over a big sea.

2619
02:34:40,130 --> 02:34:42,150
Yeah, I remember the gnome idol.

2620
02:34:43,250 --> 02:34:45,850
I don't remember how to get to the gnome idol.

2621
02:34:53,690 --> 02:34:56,750
You only get paid for completing tasks in the garden itself.

2622
02:34:57,330 --> 02:34:57,730
Gotcha!

2623
02:34:58,590 --> 02:34:59,410
Thank you.

2624
02:35:00,170 --> 02:35:01,310
For letting me know.

2625
02:35:02,630 --> 02:35:03,070
Yeah.

2626
02:35:14,920 --> 02:35:16,000
And then this.

2627
02:35:16,340 --> 02:35:18,360
Looks like we plant something in there.

2628
02:35:19,040 --> 02:35:21,460
Everything is just so confusing in this game.

2629
02:35:22,040 --> 02:35:23,800
Here, let's water the plants first.

2630
02:35:23,920 --> 02:35:24,900
This one is pretty easy.

2631
02:35:26,220 --> 02:35:27,440
This is an easy one.

2632
02:35:28,580 --> 02:35:29,600
We can do it quickly.

2633
02:35:29,820 --> 02:35:30,400
We'll do this one.

2634
02:35:30,500 --> 02:35:32,480
I'm not going to cut all the grass for the money.

2635
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:34,260
But we can...

2636
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:36,820
We can water all the plants.

2637
02:35:36,820 --> 02:35:38,500
Collect all the trash.

2638
02:35:39,740 --> 02:35:41,160
And cut the hedges.

2639
02:35:41,980 --> 02:35:42,560
And the moles.

2640
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:44,860
That should give us a good amount of money.

2641
02:35:48,890 --> 02:35:49,570
Oh, here too.

2642
02:35:53,710 --> 02:35:54,390
Excuse me!

2643
02:35:55,330 --> 02:35:56,510
Why are you being so difficult?

2644
02:35:56,510 --> 02:35:56,590
Oh!

2645
02:36:00,990 --> 02:36:01,670
Okay.

2646
02:36:04,450 --> 02:36:06,830
Yeah, the grass is just like...

2647
02:36:06,830 --> 02:36:07,930
A ton.

2648
02:36:08,370 --> 02:36:11,510
But we want to get the stuff from the other...

2649
02:36:13,250 --> 02:36:15,290
From the other girl.

2650
02:36:17,750 --> 02:36:19,010
I forgot these.

2651
02:36:24,310 --> 02:36:24,790
What?

2652
02:36:25,350 --> 02:36:26,290
What did I miss?

2653
02:36:28,490 --> 02:36:30,450
Do you think maybe the fish goes on here?

2654
02:36:32,070 --> 02:36:32,550
No.

2655
02:36:42,480 --> 02:36:44,460
Oh, trash.

2656
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:49,140
Did I miss one in here?

2657
02:36:49,240 --> 02:36:49,480
No.

2658
02:36:54,100 --> 02:36:55,060
Untrimmed hedge.

2659
02:36:56,040 --> 02:36:56,640
Yeah.

2660
02:36:59,500 --> 02:37:02,080
I know I didn't get all the hedges.

2661
02:37:06,400 --> 02:37:08,480
But I was looking for all the plants.

2662
02:37:09,660 --> 02:37:10,460
Wait, so how much...

2663
02:37:10,460 --> 02:37:11,560
Oh, you get two!

2664
02:37:12,180 --> 02:37:12,720
Wow!

2665
02:37:14,120 --> 02:37:15,840
Oh, two whole...

2666
02:37:17,260 --> 02:37:17,860
F...

2667
02:37:17,860 --> 02:37:19,020
Coins.

2668
02:37:20,080 --> 02:37:21,440
Let's go.

2669
02:37:23,240 --> 02:37:25,160
Clear all the trash.

2670
02:37:25,820 --> 02:37:27,120
That's two more!

2671
02:37:31,300 --> 02:37:33,480
What did I miss for the...

2672
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:38,720
For the flowers though.

2673
02:37:40,340 --> 02:37:41,300
Foins.

2674
02:37:42,780 --> 02:37:44,560
Yeah, we got two more foins.

2675
02:37:49,020 --> 02:37:50,660
Still haven't seen this guy with his hand.

2676
02:37:58,490 --> 02:38:01,750
I 100%ed this area, so I'm like...

2677
02:38:01,750 --> 02:38:04,070
I should know where all of it is.

2678
02:38:04,530 --> 02:38:06,130
Got rid of all the molehills.

2679
02:38:06,610 --> 02:38:07,930
Plus two foins.

2680
02:38:09,510 --> 02:38:11,470
Two whole francs.

2681
02:38:16,210 --> 02:38:19,870
If you guys see a plant that I missed...

2682
02:38:19,870 --> 02:38:20,490
Holler.

2683
02:38:21,330 --> 02:38:22,810
Just say, hey.

2684
02:38:25,810 --> 02:38:25,810
Is

2685
02:38:29,490 --> 02:38:31,490
it by the shed?

2686
02:38:32,810 --> 02:38:34,450
We are.

2687
02:38:37,810 --> 02:38:41,430
The tiniest little flower ever.

2688
02:38:43,670 --> 02:38:47,550
So what we need is...

2689
02:38:48,990 --> 02:38:50,790
It's in the park.

2690
02:38:52,430 --> 02:38:54,210
Is the door to the girl...

2691
02:38:54,210 --> 02:38:55,030
It's the...

2692
02:38:55,690 --> 02:38:58,370
Ok, how do we first unlock it?

2693
02:38:59,990 --> 02:39:02,050
There is some way to unlock it.

2694
02:39:03,550 --> 02:39:07,010
And we gotta be speedy, because...

2695
02:39:07,010 --> 02:39:07,590
Oh my gosh.

2696
02:39:08,490 --> 02:39:10,050
We gotta be like hella speedy.

2697
02:39:13,350 --> 02:39:13,870
Because...

2698
02:39:13,870 --> 02:39:14,630
What was it again?

2699
02:39:16,270 --> 02:39:17,050
There we go!

2700
02:39:17,050 --> 02:39:18,010
There we go.

2701
02:39:20,370 --> 02:39:21,730
You don't want the lighting.

2702
02:39:22,070 --> 02:39:22,650
There we go.

2703
02:39:28,930 --> 02:39:30,350
Ripped you out of it.

2704
02:39:30,390 --> 02:39:31,450
Why did you die?

2705
02:39:31,810 --> 02:39:32,430
What happened?

2706
02:39:33,430 --> 02:39:35,550
Ok, we have 14.

2707
02:39:36,010 --> 02:39:37,210
We can buy a gold medal.

2708
02:39:37,890 --> 02:39:39,870
We can buy the strange disc.

2709
02:39:40,390 --> 02:39:41,930
We can buy the office key.

2710
02:39:42,110 --> 02:39:44,130
Which I have not even seen the office.

2711
02:39:44,610 --> 02:39:46,050
I wonder if the strange disc...

2712
02:39:46,870 --> 02:39:48,270
Ok, maybe the...

2713
02:39:48,850 --> 02:39:50,410
Ok, the compass is...

2714
02:39:50,410 --> 02:39:52,450
We know the compass is for the maze.

2715
02:39:53,090 --> 02:39:56,050
The gold medal, I wonder if it's for like...

2716
02:39:57,430 --> 02:39:58,690
Oh my god, my contact.

2717
02:39:59,170 --> 02:40:01,190
I wonder if it's for the...

2718
02:40:01,190 --> 02:40:02,350
Either the well?

2719
02:40:06,610 --> 02:40:07,170
Or...

2720
02:40:08,930 --> 02:40:11,270
I think it's either for the well.

2721
02:40:13,470 --> 02:40:14,590
Or for...

2722
02:40:18,290 --> 02:40:19,990
That couple playing the game.

2723
02:40:22,830 --> 02:40:23,750
Garden gnome.

2724
02:40:26,370 --> 02:40:27,770
Medal for the snail?

2725
02:40:31,650 --> 02:40:34,390
Oh the office is probably in the gas station.

2726
02:40:34,470 --> 02:40:34,970
You're right.

2727
02:40:35,490 --> 02:40:37,290
Oh we would have to go like right now.

2728
02:40:37,910 --> 02:40:38,730
Ok, let's check it out.

2729
02:40:38,850 --> 02:40:39,190
Let's go.

2730
02:40:41,010 --> 02:40:42,150
How much more do I have?

2731
02:40:42,210 --> 02:40:42,570
12?

2732
02:40:49,390 --> 02:40:50,830
Red door to the church.

2733
02:40:51,090 --> 02:40:52,190
Gas station.

2734
02:40:54,750 --> 02:40:55,950
Omnium Prime.

2735
02:40:56,250 --> 02:40:57,950
Thanks for joining membership.

2736
02:40:58,230 --> 02:40:58,650
Thank you.

2737
02:41:03,410 --> 02:41:04,350
Strange door.

2738
02:41:07,830 --> 02:41:08,970
Yeah, computer.

2739
02:41:10,830 --> 02:41:11,850
Buy all the things.

2740
02:41:12,030 --> 02:41:13,670
See, because it's purified stone.

2741
02:41:13,770 --> 02:41:16,250
I'm wondering if it's the medal or the disc.

2742
02:41:17,030 --> 02:41:18,190
For them, you know.

2743
02:41:18,190 --> 02:41:20,810
There was that thing that they wouldn't let me steal.

2744
02:41:28,270 --> 02:41:31,290
And we gotta get the church key somehow too.

2745
02:41:32,750 --> 02:41:33,470
Is that the fairy?

2746
02:41:34,790 --> 02:41:35,230
Trash.

2747
02:41:36,450 --> 02:41:37,310
Sunday evening.

2748
02:41:37,770 --> 02:41:38,390
Strange hallway.

2749
02:41:38,910 --> 02:41:40,470
We didn't have a key for that door.

2750
02:41:40,970 --> 02:41:42,690
I don't think we will have a key for that door.

2751
02:41:44,510 --> 02:41:44,950
Unless...

2752
02:41:44,950 --> 02:41:46,190
These are all ways...

2753
02:41:46,190 --> 02:41:47,910
These are all our funny ways to die.

2754
02:41:49,210 --> 02:41:50,250
Including picnic.

2755
02:41:52,470 --> 02:41:54,850
Probably have to destroy the gnome since it's on a Polaroid.

2756
02:41:56,070 --> 02:41:56,590
Probably.

2757
02:41:59,410 --> 02:41:59,930
Probably.

2758
02:42:02,110 --> 02:42:03,890
Dumb ways to die.

2759
02:42:05,010 --> 02:42:07,190
I guess we'll grab the...

2760
02:42:10,970 --> 02:42:14,390
There was that bale of hay near them that said it was flammable.

2761
02:42:14,850 --> 02:42:15,950
You're right!

2762
02:42:16,510 --> 02:42:18,150
Okay, I'm gonna grab the medal.

2763
02:42:18,610 --> 02:42:19,470
Because it's expensive.

2764
02:42:20,150 --> 02:42:23,610
And let's leave quickly to the gas station.

2765
02:42:25,170 --> 02:42:29,550
And then from the gas station, we can go check on that couple.

2766
02:42:32,350 --> 02:42:34,750
Wait, if it's the computer on the office, you might need the disc.

2767
02:42:36,890 --> 02:42:39,230
Wait, you might be right.

2768
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:50,020
Ah!

2769
02:42:55,580 --> 02:42:56,400
Shout!

2770
02:42:56,820 --> 02:42:57,280
No!

2771
02:43:01,540 --> 02:43:03,700
Time to kill a gnome.

2772
02:43:04,760 --> 02:43:05,340
For money.

2773
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:07,720
I'm a hired hitman now.

2774
02:43:11,460 --> 02:43:12,280
Sorry.

2775
02:43:15,300 --> 02:43:16,920
Am I really sorry?

2776
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:18,760
I don't know.

2777
02:43:19,920 --> 02:43:21,440
There's also the corn.

2778
02:43:21,960 --> 02:43:23,520
Wait, that guy is not going down anymore.

2779
02:43:24,900 --> 02:43:26,120
He's just chilling up there.

2780
02:43:27,600 --> 02:43:28,360
Oh my gosh.

2781
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:30,540
So scary.

2782
02:43:31,080 --> 02:43:32,620
I think they are coming after me.

2783
02:43:37,900 --> 02:43:40,160
I think we do need the disc.

2784
02:43:44,340 --> 02:43:45,580
We got an apple.

2785
02:43:48,180 --> 02:43:49,380
Apple on the plate!

2786
02:43:57,470 --> 02:43:59,510
I won't let you destroy me.

2787
02:43:59,790 --> 02:44:00,990
I won't let you kill me.

2788
02:44:07,110 --> 02:44:08,870
Look at all these gnomes, right?

2789
02:44:09,650 --> 02:44:10,150
Crazy.

2790
02:44:10,830 --> 02:44:11,930
Could use some help.

2791
02:44:14,030 --> 02:44:15,870
Could use some help with these guys.

2792
02:44:15,870 --> 02:44:17,290
It's fine though.

2793
02:44:17,690 --> 02:44:18,310
Whatever.

2794
02:44:19,490 --> 02:44:20,250
It's fine.

2795
02:44:21,210 --> 02:44:22,590
I guess I don't need it.

2796
02:44:26,930 --> 02:44:28,810
Alright, let's do the...

2797
02:44:28,810 --> 02:44:29,690
Apple on the plate.

2798
02:44:30,590 --> 02:44:32,330
Did it say...

2799
02:44:32,330 --> 02:44:33,990
Like a...

2800
02:44:33,990 --> 02:44:35,070
Time or anything?

2801
02:44:35,190 --> 02:44:35,410
Nope.

2802
02:44:40,760 --> 02:44:42,960
It gave us...

2803
02:44:52,760 --> 02:44:54,460
Some kind of worm?

2804
02:44:56,640 --> 02:44:58,580
I'm gonna go feed it to the bird.

2805
02:45:01,200 --> 02:45:02,560
Do you want this worm?

2806
02:45:06,820 --> 02:45:08,160
Feed a bird.

2807
02:45:08,580 --> 02:45:10,740
Was the... Something mysterious happened behind me?

2808
02:45:15,790 --> 02:45:17,250
Obtained a strange key.

2809
02:45:17,930 --> 02:45:19,130
This key feels very important.

2810
02:45:24,040 --> 02:45:24,300
OK

2811
02:45:27,320 --> 02:45:27,920
Alright.

2812
02:45:28,340 --> 02:45:29,200
Rip the worm.

2813
02:45:29,260 --> 02:45:30,180
No guys, remember!

2814
02:45:31,040 --> 02:45:32,240
Remember the worm!

2815
02:45:32,240 --> 02:45:34,580
Remember, when we kept dying...

2816
02:45:34,580 --> 02:45:36,040
The guy said there's a worm.

2817
02:45:36,260 --> 02:45:38,140
There's an evil worm that is...

2818
02:45:38,140 --> 02:45:39,200
That is here.

2819
02:45:40,320 --> 02:45:42,280
That we are trying to get rid of.

2820
02:45:42,400 --> 02:45:44,420
Let's see if we can...

2821
02:45:44,420 --> 02:45:45,060
Damn.

2822
02:45:45,660 --> 02:45:48,440
So this gold coin is useless I think.

2823
02:45:48,960 --> 02:45:49,700
This gold medal.

2824
02:45:49,940 --> 02:45:50,980
For real winners only.

2825
02:45:51,620 --> 02:45:53,500
Wait, maybe I do give it to the snail.

2826
02:45:57,920 --> 02:45:58,400
Snail!

2827
02:45:59,580 --> 02:46:01,020
Oh god, you scared me.

2828
02:46:01,020 --> 02:46:02,440
Oh, he's almost there!

2829
02:46:10,260 --> 02:46:13,580
Is it for the strange hallway where the kid got you?

2830
02:46:18,920 --> 02:46:22,440
Let's try the other doors in the house first.

2831
02:46:22,540 --> 02:46:25,260
Or like, let's try everything that's locked currently.

2832
02:46:25,780 --> 02:46:27,540
Like you, it's closed.

2833
02:46:29,860 --> 02:46:30,460
Um...

2834
02:46:31,820 --> 02:46:33,680
Let's wait until midnight...

2835
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:34,620
To go in there.

2836
02:46:35,420 --> 02:46:37,600
Oh gosh, we're gonna start getting jump scared soon guys.

2837
02:46:38,400 --> 02:46:39,060
I'm scared!

2838
02:46:41,160 --> 02:46:42,160
I'm nervous.

2839
02:46:43,100 --> 02:46:44,480
Let's try the house.

2840
02:46:46,240 --> 02:46:47,840
Off limits, locked.

2841
02:46:48,500 --> 02:46:49,340
What was this door?

2842
02:46:50,440 --> 02:46:51,700
Oh, this is the gnome!

2843
02:46:52,260 --> 02:46:53,260
That's right.

2844
02:46:53,940 --> 02:46:56,440
I placed the dead goldfish in the fishbowl.

2845
02:47:01,430 --> 02:47:02,710
Gnome idol.

2846
02:47:03,010 --> 02:47:03,910
Wait, what's this?

2847
02:47:07,490 --> 02:47:09,170
We got...

2848
02:47:09,170 --> 02:47:11,590
Oh my god.

2849
02:47:12,330 --> 02:47:14,290
You guys, we're solving everything right now.

2850
02:47:14,930 --> 02:47:17,050
We are solving everything right now.

2851
02:47:20,190 --> 02:47:21,470
Silly grass?

2852
02:47:22,070 --> 02:47:23,330
Silly grass!

2853
02:47:23,330 --> 02:47:23,730
Silly grass!

2854
02:47:29,130 --> 02:47:32,990
Will I have enough money to buy the instruments though?

2855
02:47:37,970 --> 02:47:39,490
We're like getting everything.

2856
02:47:39,630 --> 02:47:40,510
We're doing so well.

2857
02:47:41,390 --> 02:47:42,510
How's the dog doing?

2858
02:47:43,070 --> 02:47:44,050
Dog is good.

2859
02:47:44,410 --> 02:47:44,910
Hi baby!

2860
02:47:49,210 --> 02:47:51,170
How much money do I have?

2861
02:47:54,830 --> 02:47:56,170
Oh my gosh!

2862
02:47:56,410 --> 02:47:58,890
I met every... I talked to every character.

2863
02:47:59,130 --> 02:48:01,270
I just never... I just didn't talk to her before.

2864
02:48:02,010 --> 02:48:03,350
Oh, I have four.

2865
02:48:03,590 --> 02:48:03,870
Okay.

2866
02:48:07,650 --> 02:48:08,650
Silly grass.

2867
02:48:16,840 --> 02:48:17,640
I'm baby.

2868
02:48:18,060 --> 02:48:18,520
Are you?

2869
02:48:21,620 --> 02:48:23,660
Exactly enough for the compass at least.

2870
02:48:23,800 --> 02:48:24,740
Or the disc.

2871
02:48:25,400 --> 02:48:27,400
Whichever we get...

2872
02:48:27,400 --> 02:48:28,560
First, I suppose.

2873
02:48:30,560 --> 02:48:32,400
I forgot to go to the couple.

2874
02:48:33,020 --> 02:48:34,320
I wonder...

2875
02:48:34,320 --> 02:48:35,420
If we can do that.

2876
02:48:36,740 --> 02:48:38,400
Gonna start getting jump scared soon.

2877
02:48:38,500 --> 02:48:40,360
Oh wait, we gotta...

2878
02:48:40,360 --> 02:48:41,800
Actually, let's just go back.

2879
02:48:42,320 --> 02:48:43,560
I know I ran all the way over here.

2880
02:48:43,900 --> 02:48:45,580
But the church door is gonna open soon.

2881
02:48:45,700 --> 02:48:46,720
And I don't wanna miss that.

2882
02:48:49,020 --> 02:48:50,620
I don't wanna miss the church door.

2883
02:48:52,360 --> 02:48:54,740
All these dead, dead gnomes.

2884
02:48:57,960 --> 02:48:58,740
I see!

2885
02:48:59,580 --> 02:49:01,040
Thanks for two months!

2886
02:49:08,670 --> 02:49:10,810
Hey, I'm just a gardener.

2887
02:49:11,670 --> 02:49:13,090
I'm just a gardener.

2888
02:49:13,190 --> 02:49:14,450
Don't jump scare me, okay?

2889
02:49:15,070 --> 02:49:16,730
I'm just doing my job.

2890
02:49:17,030 --> 02:49:18,130
Don't jump scare me, please.

2891
02:49:22,010 --> 02:49:23,910
Okay, let me in!

2892
02:49:29,650 --> 02:49:31,590
Require... Okay, so it's not that key.

2893
02:49:32,750 --> 02:49:33,310
Okay.

2894
02:49:34,130 --> 02:49:35,670
And it's not that key.

2895
02:49:42,590 --> 02:49:43,150
Okay.

2896
02:49:44,230 --> 02:49:45,690
Now we know.

2897
02:49:49,010 --> 02:49:50,390
Oh, the snail, the metal?

2898
02:49:50,630 --> 02:49:52,230
Do you think he's done?

2899
02:49:53,830 --> 02:49:55,090
Can I give it to him?

2900
02:49:56,730 --> 02:49:58,270
He didn't finish the race!

2901
02:50:01,430 --> 02:50:03,010
Oh my gosh, it's so dark.

2902
02:50:03,770 --> 02:50:04,530
So scary.

2903
02:50:04,530 --> 02:50:06,810
Don't jump scare me in here, please.

2904
02:50:08,910 --> 02:50:10,250
Yeah, he's still racing.

2905
02:50:10,670 --> 02:50:11,910
We can't just give him a medal.

2906
02:50:11,990 --> 02:50:12,910
We don't know if he's a winner.

2907
02:50:14,770 --> 02:50:16,810
Rare unedited perfectly cut screen.

2908
02:50:20,910 --> 02:50:21,790
Wrong way.

2909
02:50:22,650 --> 02:50:23,350
Here we go.

2910
02:50:26,810 --> 02:50:27,810
Oh, wrong way.

2911
02:50:29,390 --> 02:50:30,010
Hmm.

2912
02:50:31,610 --> 02:50:34,370
Let's see if that passageway has opened up in our bedroom.

2913
02:50:36,210 --> 02:50:37,350
Let's see.

2914
02:50:38,630 --> 02:50:41,550
There was a party in my shack.

2915
02:50:44,890 --> 02:50:47,350
I don't feel safe in here at all!

2916
02:50:48,690 --> 02:50:50,250
Stop giving me your hand!

2917
02:50:50,830 --> 02:50:54,210
Also guys, remind me, as soon as we wake up...

2918
02:50:54,210 --> 02:50:54,510
OK.

2919
02:50:57,110 --> 02:50:59,150
As soon as we wake up...

2920
02:50:59,150 --> 02:51:00,410
Wait, but where is the door?

2921
02:51:00,510 --> 02:51:01,930
Maybe it's on Sunday?

2922
02:51:02,130 --> 02:51:02,270
OK.

2923
02:51:08,150 --> 02:51:10,170
That kid is haunting me!

2924
02:51:10,490 --> 02:51:11,290
Go, go, go!

2925
02:51:11,310 --> 02:51:11,630
Get the door!

2926
02:51:11,730 --> 02:51:12,330
Get the door!

2927
02:51:14,250 --> 02:51:15,150
Got it!

2928
02:51:19,530 --> 02:51:21,210
That kid is haunting me!

2929
02:51:22,010 --> 02:51:23,270
A reminder battle.

2930
02:51:23,390 --> 02:51:23,930
Thank you!

2931
02:51:25,950 --> 02:51:28,370
Did I block his face?

2932
02:51:28,430 --> 02:51:28,870
I don't know.

2933
02:51:29,210 --> 02:51:30,810
He showed up like in the bottom right corner.

2934
02:51:32,430 --> 02:51:34,090
Alright, let's go see what this leads to.

2935
02:51:40,080 --> 02:51:40,860
That's it?

2936
02:51:54,120 --> 02:51:57,280
They probably expect you to get it sooner.

2937
02:51:59,460 --> 02:51:59,940
Maybe.

2938
02:52:07,090 --> 02:52:08,830
I wonder why this one doesn't...

2939
02:52:09,590 --> 02:52:11,410
Wait, do I go give him his hand back?

2940
02:52:11,510 --> 02:52:12,710
Wait, but I can't get in there.

2941
02:52:13,990 --> 02:52:16,130
I wonder if I'm supposed to give him his hand?

2942
02:52:19,600 --> 02:52:21,200
I wonder if I'm supposed to...

2943
02:52:21,980 --> 02:52:24,200
Like, after I see him in the window...

2944
02:52:24,760 --> 02:52:26,460
Can I... or can you?

2945
02:52:27,200 --> 02:52:28,160
I don't know.

2946
02:52:29,620 --> 02:52:32,080
Because there is no, like, checkmark next to it.

2947
02:52:36,650 --> 02:52:38,410
Yeah, we'll go check on the snail.

2948
02:52:38,890 --> 02:52:40,010
Don't you worry guys.

2949
02:52:40,050 --> 02:52:41,230
I'm afraid of drowning.

2950
02:52:50,710 --> 02:52:52,270
Sounds like my cat.

2951
02:53:01,090 --> 02:53:02,170
Let's back down.

2952
02:53:08,730 --> 02:53:10,870
Bring the severed hand to where it belongs.

2953
02:53:12,030 --> 02:53:12,950
You're welcome.

2954
02:53:19,030 --> 02:53:20,050
That was so easy.

2955
02:53:21,150 --> 02:53:22,810
Let's go check on our snail.

2956
02:53:23,790 --> 02:53:24,750
Wait, I'll go this way.

2957
02:53:26,490 --> 02:53:27,290
And look!

2958
02:53:27,970 --> 02:53:28,750
Welcome to membership.

2959
02:53:28,990 --> 02:53:29,550
Thank you!

2960
02:53:30,430 --> 02:53:39,190
Let's see if the key goes to... I'm almost positive the key is to the door that happens at the end of the hallway.

2961
02:53:40,110 --> 02:53:42,150
But it doesn't hurt to try other doors as well.

2962
02:53:43,790 --> 02:53:45,730
Just in case.

2963
02:53:50,120 --> 02:53:52,620
Just in case.

2964
02:53:55,400 --> 02:53:59,660
Is it fine though if I don't do anything in the gardens?

2965
02:54:00,680 --> 02:54:02,100
Is it okay though?

2966
02:54:04,240 --> 02:54:05,040
I don't know.

2967
02:54:06,040 --> 02:54:07,560
He's almost there.

2968
02:54:08,520 --> 02:54:10,540
Maybe I need to do more stuff.

2969
02:54:10,540 --> 02:54:14,300
Maybe his progress is reflective of my progress.

2970
02:54:15,280 --> 02:54:16,500
Maybe I... Let's see.

2971
02:54:16,860 --> 02:54:17,180
Oh wait.

2972
02:54:17,300 --> 02:54:17,820
Okay, hold on.

2973
02:54:20,660 --> 02:54:22,540
We get the triangle...

2974
02:54:24,800 --> 02:54:26,000
From the...

2975
02:54:26,640 --> 02:54:28,540
From the guy...

2976
02:54:30,960 --> 02:54:32,060
In the park.

2977
02:54:32,380 --> 02:54:33,580
By the gas station I mean.

2978
02:54:33,620 --> 02:54:33,840
Sorry.

2979
02:54:37,220 --> 02:54:40,550
We get...

2980
02:54:40,550 --> 02:54:41,910
Yeah, we need the egg ball.

2981
02:54:43,370 --> 02:54:44,630
It's not open.

2982
02:54:48,330 --> 02:54:49,690
It might open later.

2983
02:54:50,690 --> 02:54:54,010
But I don't remember where we get the other instrument.

2984
02:55:00,300 --> 02:55:02,220
I don't quite remember that.

2985
02:55:05,380 --> 02:55:06,620
Snip, snip, snip.

2986
02:55:07,120 --> 02:55:11,680
Maybe the more I snip, the more progress the snail will have.

2987
02:55:13,740 --> 02:55:15,260
And let's do this too.

2988
02:55:18,640 --> 02:55:19,740
The maze area.

2989
02:55:22,940 --> 02:55:24,120
Oh, the symbols.

2990
02:55:24,200 --> 02:55:24,760
That's right.

2991
02:55:25,240 --> 02:55:25,900
Thank you.

2992
02:55:26,580 --> 02:55:27,320
Okay, yeah.

2993
02:55:27,440 --> 02:55:28,380
Let's go back and do that.

2994
02:55:30,780 --> 02:55:33,140
Yes, there is the entrance to the maze.

2995
02:55:34,820 --> 02:55:36,120
Yes, yes, yes.

2996
02:55:36,280 --> 02:55:36,660
That's right.

2997
02:55:36,720 --> 02:55:38,940
We get more money by completing stuff in an area.

2998
02:55:38,940 --> 02:55:42,140
So let's just do the mole hills here.

2999
02:55:43,900 --> 02:55:46,760
Oh, and more money baby!

3000
02:55:47,400 --> 02:55:49,480
Let's do the mole hills here.

3001
02:55:49,880 --> 02:55:51,360
We can ignore all the grass.

3002
02:55:53,480 --> 02:55:55,920
Oh my gosh guys, we are gaming, we are gaming, we are gaming!

3003
02:55:57,620 --> 02:55:59,720
We are so gaming right now.

3004
02:55:59,720 --> 02:56:00,960
Snipe, snipe, snipe.

3005
02:56:05,140 --> 02:56:07,860
I need more mole hills.

3006
02:56:10,390 --> 02:56:11,860
I need more mole hills.

3007
02:56:12,700 --> 02:56:19,300
Mole hill, mole hill, mole hill, mole hill...

3008
02:56:19,300 --> 02:56:20,860
Huh?

3009
02:56:20,860 --> 02:56:24,860
Moheo, moheo, moheo, moheo, moheo, moheo.

3010
02:56:25,520 --> 02:56:25,880
Huh?

3011
02:56:27,900 --> 02:56:29,000
Where did I...

3012
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:29,960
Where did I miss it?

3013
02:56:31,280 --> 02:56:32,880
This is the grun, guys.

3014
02:56:34,900 --> 02:56:36,020
Not the grun.

3015
02:56:37,720 --> 02:56:40,860
The thing my friends and I, we really love is the...

3016
02:56:41,980 --> 02:56:43,380
Is the picture of like...

3017
02:56:43,380 --> 02:56:46,500
Have you guys ever seen the picture of the dog that's like dyed green?

3018
02:56:47,020 --> 02:56:48,360
And they're like, it's the grunch.

3019
02:56:48,360 --> 02:56:49,440
Or whatever.

3020
02:56:51,140 --> 02:56:52,820
We laugh about him every year.

3021
02:56:56,420 --> 02:56:59,080
Maybe I don't get money for here.

3022
02:57:01,060 --> 02:57:02,080
The gunch.

3023
02:57:02,140 --> 02:57:03,160
Yeah, it's the gunch.

3024
02:57:04,280 --> 02:57:05,000
I found nothing.

3025
02:57:05,260 --> 02:57:06,500
There are holes in the tree.

3026
02:57:07,500 --> 02:57:08,020
Sometimes.

3027
02:57:08,860 --> 02:57:10,080
We're gonna make it.

3028
02:57:10,580 --> 02:57:12,760
Do I not make money for these areas?

3029
02:57:12,900 --> 02:57:14,000
Did I miss something?

3030
02:57:14,940 --> 02:57:16,260
I don't think I missed anything.

3031
02:57:17,560 --> 02:57:19,520
It's a pretty looking vase.

3032
02:57:27,500 --> 02:57:30,360
I think they only pay you at the main garden for work.

3033
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:31,100
Dang.

3034
02:57:32,300 --> 02:57:32,700
Oh well.

3035
02:57:33,620 --> 02:57:35,820
We got an extra coin, so we can afford the...

3036
02:57:37,600 --> 02:57:38,080
Oh.

3037
02:57:38,420 --> 02:57:38,980
Oh, please.

3038
02:57:41,060 --> 02:57:42,680
We can afford...

3039
02:57:42,680 --> 02:57:46,540
I think we can afford the CD, the disc.

3040
02:57:46,780 --> 02:57:48,640
Oh, let's go see that couple.

3041
02:57:48,640 --> 02:57:50,500
And set their stuff on fire.

3042
02:57:54,820 --> 02:57:56,780
Let's go set their things on fire.

3043
02:57:57,280 --> 02:57:59,240
And let's go save this lady.

3044
02:58:00,440 --> 02:58:00,780
You okay?

3045
02:58:02,960 --> 02:58:04,600
Are you still alive?

3046
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:06,860
I don't know.

3047
02:58:07,920 --> 02:58:09,040
You bought the disc, didn't you?

3048
02:58:09,100 --> 02:58:10,680
No, I bought the gold medal.

3049
02:58:12,660 --> 02:58:14,320
I got the gold medal.

3050
02:58:14,600 --> 02:58:15,720
Oh, the snail.

3051
02:58:16,740 --> 02:58:17,180
Sorry.

3052
02:58:17,360 --> 02:58:19,500
Oh my gosh, my brain is everywhere with this game.

3053
02:58:19,580 --> 02:58:20,520
I'm like, let's go do this.

3054
02:58:20,640 --> 02:58:22,040
Oh, wait, I forgot about this.

3055
02:58:22,260 --> 02:58:23,000
Let's go do this.

3056
02:58:23,200 --> 02:58:26,700
My brain with this game is so crazy.

3057
02:58:27,660 --> 02:58:29,340
But the egg also cost $5.

3058
02:58:30,240 --> 02:58:31,120
You're right.

3059
02:58:35,390 --> 02:58:37,590
How do we get more money in this game?

3060
02:58:42,570 --> 02:58:43,930
He's so close!

3061
02:58:44,090 --> 02:58:45,910
I think it's my progress, guys.

3062
02:58:47,370 --> 02:58:48,730
I think I gotta do more.

3063
02:58:50,810 --> 02:58:51,890
Hmm, okay.

3064
02:58:57,950 --> 02:58:59,190
ADHD simulator.

3065
02:59:00,750 --> 02:59:02,390
There's just so much.

3066
02:59:07,370 --> 02:59:08,950
Oh, the corn.

3067
02:59:11,410 --> 02:59:13,890
I'm gonna grab as much as I can...

3068
02:59:13,890 --> 02:59:16,370
and just throw something against the wall...

3069
02:59:16,370 --> 02:59:17,390
and see what works, you know?

3070
02:59:17,690 --> 02:59:19,630
The sky is still...

3071
02:59:19,630 --> 02:59:20,670
all the way up.

3072
02:59:21,930 --> 02:59:23,030
Thank you, sir.

3073
02:59:23,430 --> 02:59:23,850
Goodbye.

3074
02:59:28,140 --> 02:59:29,900
This town is so quiet.

3075
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:43,560
Hello.

3076
02:59:46,380 --> 02:59:48,780
They will not let you take this special piece.

3077
02:59:59,650 --> 03:00:01,110
I think we need this for something.

3078
03:00:02,670 --> 03:00:05,210
I think we need this purified stone.

3079
03:00:05,930 --> 03:00:08,810
I think if we didn't have it...

3080
03:00:08,810 --> 03:00:10,090
it wouldn't be good.

3081
03:00:11,650 --> 03:00:13,810
A magical stone that wards off evil.

3082
03:00:15,350 --> 03:00:16,450
I had to do...

3083
03:00:16,450 --> 03:00:17,370
Am I the evil?

3084
03:00:17,690 --> 03:00:21,690
I had to do crimes to obtain this.

3085
03:00:23,850 --> 03:00:25,490
I might be the evil.

3086
03:00:27,610 --> 03:00:30,750
Are there any other coins that we didn't pick up?

3087
03:00:31,590 --> 03:00:33,110
I don't think so.

3088
03:00:33,250 --> 03:00:34,450
Not that I can remember, at least.

3089
03:00:39,230 --> 03:00:41,110
I'm honestly thinking...

3090
03:00:42,190 --> 03:00:45,250
of doing the children...

3091
03:00:45,250 --> 03:00:46,010
their little...

3092
03:00:46,010 --> 03:00:49,110
giving them the...

3093
03:00:51,370 --> 03:00:52,710
the strange...

3094
03:00:52,710 --> 03:00:54,770
this is also five...

3095
03:00:54,770 --> 03:00:56,890
five coins.

3096
03:00:56,890 --> 03:00:57,090
Coins.

3097
03:00:59,330 --> 03:01:00,210
What's the phrase?

3098
03:01:01,650 --> 03:01:02,370
The recital?

3099
03:01:05,150 --> 03:01:06,070
What did I say?

3100
03:01:08,950 --> 03:01:09,910
What did I say?

3101
03:01:10,970 --> 03:01:11,830
Let's see if this is open.

3102
03:01:12,550 --> 03:01:13,810
No, it's not open.

3103
03:01:14,710 --> 03:01:15,210
Please.

3104
03:01:16,850 --> 03:01:18,690
This kid needs his triangle.

3105
03:01:23,590 --> 03:01:24,750
Oh, come on.

3106
03:01:24,750 --> 03:01:26,490
Let me show you how it's done.

3107
03:01:45,550 --> 03:01:49,250
Do you remember...

3108
03:01:49,250 --> 03:01:51,230
the 21st night...

3109
03:01:51,230 --> 03:01:51,850
of September?

3110
03:01:57,770 --> 03:01:59,650
I'm just kidding.

3111
03:02:04,530 --> 03:02:05,670
You guys okay?

3112
03:02:13,110 --> 03:02:15,630
Watered mysterious flowers.

3113
03:02:18,310 --> 03:02:19,970
Triggered war flashbacks.

3114
03:02:20,990 --> 03:02:21,350
No.

3115
03:02:22,790 --> 03:02:23,950
No.

3116
03:02:24,530 --> 03:02:25,470
You guys are so dramatic.

3117
03:02:35,150 --> 03:02:35,570
What?

3118
03:02:39,730 --> 03:02:40,150
Alright.

3119
03:02:44,990 --> 03:02:46,630
I'm doing this, so maybe...

3120
03:02:47,510 --> 03:02:48,640
when we go back to the snail...

3121
03:02:51,230 --> 03:02:52,210
he'll be complete.

3122
03:02:53,190 --> 03:02:53,790
Let's see.

3123
03:02:53,950 --> 03:02:55,370
Let's go back to our snail guy.

3124
03:02:55,370 --> 03:02:58,210
I honestly don't know if it's...

3125
03:02:58,210 --> 03:02:59,630
game progression or what, but...

3126
03:02:59,990 --> 03:03:01,470
he deserves his medal.

3127
03:03:02,870 --> 03:03:04,230
He deserves it.

3128
03:03:08,510 --> 03:03:09,870
Earth, wind and fiber?

3129
03:03:10,510 --> 03:03:11,230
You mean fire?

3130
03:03:13,230 --> 03:03:14,510
He's so close.

3131
03:03:14,610 --> 03:03:14,810
Wait.

3132
03:03:16,090 --> 03:03:16,870
Is he done?

3133
03:03:17,030 --> 03:03:17,650
Did he make it?

3134
03:03:22,170 --> 03:03:23,690
He's basically touching it.

3135
03:03:25,930 --> 03:03:26,830
Midnight tonight?

3136
03:03:26,990 --> 03:03:27,270
Maybe.

3137
03:03:28,030 --> 03:03:28,650
That's right!

3138
03:03:28,970 --> 03:03:30,210
There is a coin under there!

3139
03:03:30,670 --> 03:03:31,650
I found another one.

3140
03:03:33,250 --> 03:03:35,350
I think if I...

3141
03:03:35,350 --> 03:03:37,370
can't get...

3142
03:03:38,390 --> 03:03:40,910
the kids to play...

3143
03:03:40,910 --> 03:03:42,310
Let's just buy the disc.

3144
03:03:43,490 --> 03:03:44,290
There's no point.

3145
03:03:45,990 --> 03:03:47,070
Otherwise, you know?

3146
03:03:50,290 --> 03:03:51,510
What else was in here?

3147
03:03:58,440 --> 03:03:59,380
And the idol.

3148
03:03:59,680 --> 03:03:59,960
That's right.

3149
03:04:01,580 --> 03:04:03,140
Let's just go get the...

3150
03:04:03,140 --> 03:04:04,680
Let's just go get the disc instead.

3151
03:04:05,500 --> 03:04:06,220
Did you have anything?

3152
03:04:06,620 --> 03:04:07,600
The pizza box!

3153
03:04:08,020 --> 03:04:10,340
What do we have a pizza box for?

3154
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:14,240
What do we have a pizza box for?

3155
03:04:43,590 --> 03:04:46,390
I don't

3156
03:04:53,230 --> 03:04:53,490
know.

3157
03:04:54,090 --> 03:04:55,490
I don't know.

3158
03:04:55,490 --> 03:04:56,170
In the well?

3159
03:04:58,250 --> 03:05:00,350
The eternal...

3160
03:05:00,350 --> 03:05:00,970
trash can?

3161
03:05:02,090 --> 03:05:03,190
The never end...

3162
03:05:03,190 --> 03:05:05,410
We have no idea where it goes to.

3163
03:05:05,570 --> 03:05:06,430
Wait a second!

3164
03:05:07,130 --> 03:05:08,510
I can't use this disc!

3165
03:05:10,730 --> 03:05:11,210
Unless...

3166
03:05:11,210 --> 03:05:12,270
Let's just buy it.

3167
03:05:14,330 --> 03:05:14,810
Because...

3168
03:05:14,810 --> 03:05:15,970
I realized...

3169
03:05:15,970 --> 03:05:17,810
The gas station is not open.

3170
03:05:17,930 --> 03:05:19,310
But I feel like we can still buy it.

3171
03:05:19,730 --> 03:05:21,150
What does it say about it?

3172
03:05:24,920 --> 03:05:26,620
What could be on this disc?

3173
03:05:31,230 --> 03:05:32,990
You just passed the trash can.

3174
03:05:32,990 --> 03:05:33,570
I did?

3175
03:05:33,950 --> 03:05:34,370
Where?

3176
03:05:35,710 --> 03:05:36,770
Oh, there was one.

3177
03:05:37,310 --> 03:05:38,690
Let's see if I can throw it away in here.

3178
03:05:40,870 --> 03:05:41,310
Nope.

3179
03:05:42,410 --> 03:05:43,550
Let's try the well.

3180
03:05:57,760 --> 03:05:58,200
Confused!

3181
03:05:59,240 --> 03:06:01,900
I'm glad you're not confused about being here!

3182
03:06:02,060 --> 03:06:03,140
I think there's six months!

3183
03:06:05,860 --> 03:06:08,140
Oh, the boat is on the other side.

3184
03:06:08,360 --> 03:06:09,440
What a useless buy.

3185
03:06:10,860 --> 03:06:12,380
Well, I guess we didn't buy anything.

3186
03:06:12,560 --> 03:06:14,680
But a useless...

3187
03:06:14,680 --> 03:06:15,300
time.

3188
03:06:21,720 --> 03:06:22,540
Excuse me.

3189
03:06:24,240 --> 03:06:25,560
He's still racing, ok.

3190
03:06:26,760 --> 03:06:28,060
Still racing, guys.

3191
03:06:28,180 --> 03:06:28,860
Still racing.

3192
03:06:34,650 --> 03:06:35,290
Dang it!

3193
03:06:35,350 --> 03:06:36,990
Oh, that makes me so...

3194
03:06:38,710 --> 03:06:39,150
frustrated.

3195
03:06:43,090 --> 03:06:43,610
That...

3196
03:06:46,980 --> 03:06:49,420
That I didn't get the symbols instead...

3197
03:06:49,420 --> 03:06:52,040
or the triangle instead.

3198
03:06:54,400 --> 03:06:56,080
We have just a few items.

3199
03:06:56,180 --> 03:06:58,360
It's confusing what to do with them, you know?

3200
03:06:59,220 --> 03:07:00,020
Break in.

3201
03:07:00,100 --> 03:07:00,600
Yeah, right?

3202
03:07:09,420 --> 03:07:10,820
Oh my god!

3203
03:07:13,360 --> 03:07:14,560
I calmed her down.

3204
03:07:18,020 --> 03:07:19,280
Silly grass!

3205
03:07:25,410 --> 03:07:27,390
Should we go to the gardener?

3206
03:07:33,050 --> 03:07:35,330
Oh my god!

3207
03:07:45,510 --> 03:07:45,930
Inserts!

3208
03:07:48,130 --> 03:07:49,990
Oh, I don't like this.

3209
03:07:49,990 --> 03:07:50,710
Guys?

3210
03:07:51,330 --> 03:07:52,390
This area is really spooky.

3211
03:07:53,430 --> 03:07:54,110
Guys?

3212
03:07:58,560 --> 03:07:59,240
Read.

3213
03:08:00,480 --> 03:08:01,840
May 16, 2001.

3214
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:04,640
Notes on the Supernatural by F.H.

3215
03:08:04,980 --> 03:08:05,500
Postma.

3216
03:08:07,480 --> 03:08:12,200
I have seen or felt the presence of at least five mysterious spirits.

3217
03:08:13,060 --> 03:08:16,820
The tall man, always observant as if chasing a prey.

3218
03:08:16,820 --> 03:08:21,760
The short man, it is childlike, reckless, always running about.

3219
03:08:22,700 --> 03:08:25,740
The shy figure, invisible and perhaps not harmful.

3220
03:08:27,020 --> 03:08:31,240
The gnome, a weaker spirit but should not be underestimated.

3221
03:08:32,260 --> 03:08:34,740
The worm, probably a very young spirit.

3222
03:08:34,940 --> 03:08:36,100
It is not clear what it wants.

3223
03:08:36,140 --> 03:08:36,620
That's the one.

3224
03:08:36,680 --> 03:08:37,660
That's the evilest one.

3225
03:08:38,700 --> 03:08:41,660
How and why these spirits invaded this town is still a mystery.

3226
03:08:42,460 --> 03:08:45,280
I got aware of the existence of magical idols.

3227
03:08:46,280 --> 03:08:49,680
They are mystical statues that predate mankind.

3228
03:08:50,720 --> 03:08:52,580
Undoubtedly, something must be done with them.

3229
03:08:53,340 --> 03:08:55,240
The last pages of the book seem to be torn out.

3230
03:08:57,540 --> 03:09:00,280
Don't tell me I'm gonna have to do like...

3231
03:09:03,280 --> 03:09:03,720
another...

3232
03:09:04,280 --> 03:09:05,220
Oh my gosh!

3233
03:09:06,080 --> 03:09:07,700
I think I'm inside his house!

3234
03:09:08,520 --> 03:09:08,820
Uh oh.

3235
03:09:09,180 --> 03:09:10,260
Isn't this area off limits?

3236
03:09:10,260 --> 03:09:10,320
What?

3237
03:09:14,980 --> 03:09:15,740
What's in here?

3238
03:09:16,260 --> 03:09:16,900
The kitchen.

3239
03:09:18,700 --> 03:09:20,080
A bunch of onions!

3240
03:09:22,400 --> 03:09:23,680
Why do you have a bunch of onions?

3241
03:09:24,440 --> 03:09:24,720
Uh oh.

3242
03:09:25,160 --> 03:09:26,540
I'm not supposed to be in here you guys.

3243
03:09:30,570 --> 03:09:30,970
Jammed.

3244
03:09:31,110 --> 03:09:31,950
Everything is jammed.

3245
03:09:32,290 --> 03:09:33,270
The church key!

3246
03:09:44,250 --> 03:09:45,890
First, snail.

3247
03:09:46,450 --> 03:09:47,950
Then, church.

3248
03:09:54,330 --> 03:09:55,530
First, snail.

3249
03:09:56,750 --> 03:09:58,090
Then, church.

3250
03:09:58,230 --> 03:09:58,990
Guys, we're gaming.

3251
03:10:00,730 --> 03:10:02,650
Am I supposed to...

3252
03:10:02,650 --> 03:10:03,570
He's still racing.

3253
03:10:03,670 --> 03:10:04,970
Okay snail, you're too slow.

3254
03:10:05,070 --> 03:10:05,430
I'm sorry.

3255
03:10:06,210 --> 03:10:07,230
I tried to get... I tried.

3256
03:10:08,070 --> 03:10:08,650
I really did.

3257
03:10:10,410 --> 03:10:11,630
Do you think...

3258
03:10:14,210 --> 03:10:14,690
Um...

3259
03:10:14,690 --> 03:10:17,790
Do you think I need to pacify...

3260
03:10:17,790 --> 03:10:20,630
Do you think I need to pacify all five ghosts to...

3261
03:10:22,070 --> 03:10:22,550
to...

3262
03:10:22,550 --> 03:10:25,250
beat the game though, I wonder.

3263
03:10:35,920 --> 03:10:38,900
Because we didn't try with the pizza...

3264
03:10:38,900 --> 03:10:40,020
You cannot see the bottom.

3265
03:10:40,260 --> 03:10:40,940
Still the same.

3266
03:10:41,020 --> 03:10:41,180
Okay.

3267
03:10:41,980 --> 03:10:43,020
Get the idols.

3268
03:10:43,200 --> 03:10:47,620
I think, yeah, maybe destroying or pacifying each thing gets an idol.

3269
03:10:48,260 --> 03:10:50,180
Because we have...

3270
03:10:52,620 --> 03:10:54,920
Didn't I get another idol before?

3271
03:10:55,240 --> 03:10:56,960
In like a previous... Oh, the short idol.

3272
03:10:57,180 --> 03:10:58,420
Yeah, we did get this one.

3273
03:10:59,440 --> 03:11:00,680
We got this guy.

3274
03:11:01,740 --> 03:11:03,180
And we got...

3275
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:06,520
We only got two idols.

3276
03:11:08,640 --> 03:11:09,720
Oh, okay.

3277
03:11:09,940 --> 03:11:10,360
Just kidding.

3278
03:11:21,070 --> 03:11:21,710
Hello?

3279
03:11:24,390 --> 03:11:26,010
You cannot make out what they say.

3280
03:11:34,330 --> 03:11:35,390
Where are they?

3281
03:11:37,570 --> 03:11:38,850
Flower door.

3282
03:11:39,330 --> 03:11:39,810
Flower...

3283
03:11:43,690 --> 03:11:45,190
What the hell is this?

3284
03:11:45,430 --> 03:11:47,870
The altar contains a hole in the shape of a flower.

3285
03:11:48,290 --> 03:11:51,330
Oh my god guys, there is still so much more...

3286
03:11:51,330 --> 03:11:52,290
going on here.

3287
03:11:52,350 --> 03:11:53,770
And there is a ghost in here somewhere.

3288
03:11:56,810 --> 03:11:57,650
Somewhere though.

3289
03:11:57,870 --> 03:11:59,330
Because it...

3290
03:11:59,330 --> 03:12:00,890
It doesn't... It stops shaking.

3291
03:12:02,990 --> 03:12:03,730
Like this?

3292
03:12:04,150 --> 03:12:05,850
We stay in the realm.

3293
03:12:08,350 --> 03:12:09,210
I think.

3294
03:12:09,270 --> 03:12:10,290
I think that's what that means.

3295
03:12:11,210 --> 03:12:11,930
Maybe not.

3296
03:12:12,050 --> 03:12:12,430
I don't know.

3297
03:12:14,130 --> 03:12:15,030
Flower door.

3298
03:12:15,970 --> 03:12:16,970
Can you light the candles?

3299
03:12:17,610 --> 03:12:18,430
Oh, let's try.

3300
03:12:23,980 --> 03:12:25,140
Let's see if we can.

3301
03:12:25,780 --> 03:12:26,460
I can!

3302
03:12:30,160 --> 03:12:32,060
Why is this person in here though?

3303
03:12:32,240 --> 03:12:34,660
Church is not... not available.

3304
03:12:38,610 --> 03:12:39,250
Hmm.

3305
03:12:41,270 --> 03:12:42,170
Please, father.

3306
03:12:42,750 --> 03:12:44,170
I... I have sinned.

3307
03:12:44,490 --> 03:12:46,230
Please let me...

3308
03:12:46,230 --> 03:12:47,750
Let me confess my sins.

3309
03:12:47,850 --> 03:12:48,130
Please!

3310
03:12:52,310 --> 03:12:55,930
I really don't want to do another run through, but like there is...

3311
03:12:56,450 --> 03:12:58,190
Still so much we haven't done.

3312
03:12:58,670 --> 03:12:59,470
Silly grass!

3313
03:13:13,050 --> 03:13:13,690
Locked.

3314
03:13:16,070 --> 03:13:17,130
There it is.

3315
03:13:17,510 --> 03:13:18,350
Alright guys.

3316
03:13:19,090 --> 03:13:22,070
This could be life or death for us.

3317
03:13:22,110 --> 03:13:23,030
We have the key.

3318
03:13:23,530 --> 03:13:25,010
We have that weird key.

3319
03:13:30,550 --> 03:13:32,030
Wherever it is.

3320
03:13:35,810 --> 03:13:36,730
The strange key.

3321
03:13:37,030 --> 03:13:38,110
It is not of this world.

3322
03:13:39,170 --> 03:13:40,710
We already pacified that kid too.

3323
03:13:41,770 --> 03:13:43,650
So I guess now is the time.

3324
03:13:45,190 --> 03:13:47,130
Can you hammer the flower door?

3325
03:13:47,130 --> 03:13:49,810
For some reason, I don't feel like you can.

3326
03:13:49,890 --> 03:13:51,290
Check the snail one last time.

3327
03:13:57,470 --> 03:13:58,550
No, you can't do it.

3328
03:14:00,330 --> 03:14:01,130
Alright snail.

3329
03:14:01,650 --> 03:14:03,130
I'm really invested in him.

3330
03:14:04,790 --> 03:14:07,110
I'm really invested in that guy, I'll be honest.

3331
03:14:07,650 --> 03:14:09,410
I just want the snail to make it, you know.

3332
03:14:10,210 --> 03:14:11,690
I just want him to get his prize.

3333
03:14:13,250 --> 03:14:14,550
I want him to be a winner.

3334
03:14:17,210 --> 03:14:18,530
Come on snail!

3335
03:14:20,670 --> 03:14:23,210
We spent 10 coins on this medal.

3336
03:14:24,590 --> 03:14:26,170
Oh my god!

3337
03:14:27,850 --> 03:14:28,810
I give up.

3338
03:14:31,630 --> 03:14:32,710
Alright, let's go.

3339
03:14:33,150 --> 03:14:35,730
Maybe there will be the key to the flower door in there.

3340
03:14:37,050 --> 03:14:38,470
I don't want to waste too much time.

3341
03:14:48,710 --> 03:14:49,630
I'm so close.

3342
03:14:51,670 --> 03:14:52,230
Hello?

3343
03:14:53,170 --> 03:14:53,970
Oh my god!

3344
03:14:54,990 --> 03:14:55,790
Ah, no.

3345
03:14:56,830 --> 03:14:57,910
Meet the orb.

3346
03:14:58,150 --> 03:14:59,770
That's what this achievement is.

3347
03:15:00,310 --> 03:15:01,170
Is it truly you?

3348
03:15:01,970 --> 03:15:03,750
You actually managed to find me!

3349
03:15:04,410 --> 03:15:08,050
Now that you are finally here, let me introduce myself to you.

3350
03:15:08,570 --> 03:15:11,070
I am the owner of the garden you are tending to.

3351
03:15:11,070 --> 03:15:11,650
Oh yeah.

3352
03:15:15,390 --> 03:15:18,230
I'm really tending to it well.

3353
03:15:18,550 --> 03:15:22,130
I've watered the plants and...

3354
03:15:22,770 --> 03:15:24,370
Or what is left of me.

3355
03:15:25,710 --> 03:15:28,290
My soul got trapped in here by evil spirits!

3356
03:15:29,370 --> 03:15:30,990
Who managed to invade our world.

3357
03:15:32,030 --> 03:15:33,930
And use this place as some kind of gateway.

3358
03:15:34,530 --> 03:15:37,890
I was about to do something about that, but now I am unable to do anything.

3359
03:15:37,890 --> 03:15:43,130
You see, the spirits I am talking of present themselves in many forms.

3360
03:15:43,730 --> 03:15:46,330
I learned that at least four of them are active here.

3361
03:15:46,850 --> 03:15:49,550
Each of their soul is attached to some kind of idol.

3362
03:15:49,870 --> 03:15:50,050
Yes!

3363
03:15:51,030 --> 03:15:54,410
And the only way to put them to rest is to locate these idols.

3364
03:15:54,910 --> 03:15:56,690
And then bring them to the church.

3365
03:15:57,390 --> 03:15:59,610
Where these idols reside, I do not know.

3366
03:16:00,430 --> 03:16:02,670
But they should be in or near the village.

3367
03:16:03,210 --> 03:16:05,710
I hope you are willing to take up this task.

3368
03:16:06,270 --> 03:16:08,670
If the spirits do not get stopped...

3369
03:16:08,670 --> 03:16:11,090
Then who knows what awaits us all.

3370
03:16:12,210 --> 03:16:14,190
I also wonder if...

3371
03:16:14,190 --> 03:16:17,270
If Ken ever gets my body back.

3372
03:16:18,010 --> 03:16:19,470
I'm going to get my body back.

3373
03:16:20,290 --> 03:16:22,170
But that should not be the main priority now.

3374
03:16:23,110 --> 03:16:24,630
I suggest you head out of this place.

3375
03:16:24,990 --> 03:16:26,470
It might not be safe to linger here.

3376
03:16:26,990 --> 03:16:28,250
I wish you all the best of luck.

3377
03:16:29,610 --> 03:16:30,330
That's it?

3378
03:16:38,170 --> 03:16:39,610
I thought that was going to be an ending.

3379
03:16:43,370 --> 03:16:45,830
He said at least four of them.

3380
03:16:55,250 --> 03:16:56,390
Two Polaroids on the ground?

3381
03:16:57,910 --> 03:16:58,910
Oh, thank you.

3382
03:17:01,670 --> 03:17:02,670
A crypt?

3383
03:17:04,150 --> 03:17:05,550
Oh, we got the gnome idol.

3384
03:17:07,270 --> 03:17:08,270
The crypt.

3385
03:17:15,850 --> 03:17:17,970
Something is like flashing in the room.

3386
03:17:18,150 --> 03:17:19,230
It's kind of freaking me out.

3387
03:17:20,350 --> 03:17:21,850
I can't tell if the game pauses.

3388
03:17:21,850 --> 03:17:24,750
I don't think it does when I'm going through my stuff.

3389
03:17:24,810 --> 03:17:25,870
I don't think the game pauses.

3390
03:17:26,510 --> 03:17:28,290
It's kind of scary.

3391
03:17:31,790 --> 03:17:32,530
Flower door?

3392
03:17:32,730 --> 03:17:33,030
Crypt?

3393
03:17:35,990 --> 03:17:36,450
Trash?

3394
03:17:38,230 --> 03:17:38,950
Strange hallway?

3395
03:17:39,210 --> 03:17:40,190
Oh, these are the deaths.

3396
03:17:49,690 --> 03:17:50,150
Maybe...

3397
03:17:50,150 --> 03:17:54,450
When the guy comes up and jumpscares me?

3398
03:17:56,610 --> 03:17:58,070
What if I just do this?

3399
03:18:00,150 --> 03:18:00,830
Oh my god!

3400
03:18:04,710 --> 03:18:05,270
Wait.

3401
03:18:09,930 --> 03:18:15,390
Because I was going to try and get the guy that jumpscares me, but clearly that didn't work with the trumpet.

3402
03:18:20,150 --> 03:18:23,050
Do, do, do, do, do...

3403
03:18:31,810 --> 03:18:32,350
Snail!

3404
03:18:33,250 --> 03:18:34,790
Oh my god!

3405
03:18:36,030 --> 03:18:36,790
True winner.

3406
03:18:36,930 --> 03:18:38,990
Award a golden medal to a true winner.

3407
03:18:39,450 --> 03:18:40,470
Wait, what did it say?

3408
03:18:40,870 --> 03:18:42,570
This is a proud snail.

3409
03:18:42,790 --> 03:18:44,570
That cost me... Wait, what do I get for it?

3410
03:18:45,710 --> 03:18:46,470
He won!

3411
03:18:46,470 --> 03:18:46,570
He won!

3412
03:19:15,950 --> 03:19:18,310
That was a cute achievement.

3413
03:19:20,970 --> 03:19:23,710
These other guys though...

3414
03:19:26,950 --> 03:19:29,710
Let's go to the gardener.

3415
03:19:30,390 --> 03:19:32,470
While we can...

3416
03:19:32,470 --> 03:19:34,110
Victory lap for the snail.

3417
03:19:36,630 --> 03:19:38,690
The snail is number one!

3418
03:19:39,830 --> 03:19:42,930
I feel like those T-shirts where it's just like...

3419
03:19:42,930 --> 03:19:45,110
I went all the way to...

3420
03:19:45,890 --> 03:19:49,070
To this crazy place and all I got was a T-shirt.

3421
03:19:49,490 --> 03:19:50,530
Wait, something is on fire?

3422
03:19:51,430 --> 03:19:51,890
Guys?

3423
03:19:53,630 --> 03:19:55,390
I guess we'll go there in a second.

3424
03:19:57,730 --> 03:19:58,610
I'm here!

3425
03:19:59,510 --> 03:20:01,730
To pacify you!

3426
03:20:02,710 --> 03:20:04,690
The ghost calms down.

3427
03:20:05,130 --> 03:20:05,870
Bye bye!

3428
03:20:10,240 --> 03:20:11,880
Yeah, I have gotten the worm.

3429
03:20:12,460 --> 03:20:14,980
I fed him to the bird.

3430
03:20:23,030 --> 03:20:24,170
What is this?

3431
03:20:26,190 --> 03:20:27,710
Someone crashed here.

3432
03:20:29,650 --> 03:20:30,650
Oh my god!

3433
03:20:33,770 --> 03:20:34,930
Oh my god!

3434
03:20:35,070 --> 03:20:36,050
Wait, what?

3435
03:20:36,050 --> 03:20:37,750
How did this happen?

3436
03:20:40,330 --> 03:20:41,290
What is this?

3437
03:20:41,930 --> 03:20:43,770
Someone lost their cigarette.

3438
03:20:50,910 --> 03:20:53,370
Guys, I'm so not sure what to do anymore.

3439
03:20:58,430 --> 03:21:00,050
It's time for me to go to bed.

3440
03:21:01,090 --> 03:21:02,210
Oh, I'm far from home.

3441
03:21:04,710 --> 03:21:07,970
I guess let's just see what happens if...

3442
03:21:11,030 --> 03:21:12,390
Nothing happens.

3443
03:21:15,170 --> 03:21:16,330
Security dudes!

3444
03:21:19,250 --> 03:21:20,350
Wait, what's that?

3445
03:21:20,450 --> 03:21:21,310
Oh, that's the guy that died.

3446
03:21:21,790 --> 03:21:22,390
Oh my god!

3447
03:21:24,330 --> 03:21:26,150
I got the Shy Idol!

3448
03:21:27,290 --> 03:21:27,910
Wait!

3449
03:21:28,130 --> 03:21:28,850
Oh my god!

3450
03:21:29,350 --> 03:21:31,530
Oh my god!

3451
03:21:33,250 --> 03:21:35,350
I got the Shy Idol!

3452
03:21:36,090 --> 03:21:37,630
We need one more.

3453
03:21:40,690 --> 03:21:41,250
What?

3454
03:21:43,290 --> 03:21:45,510
Do you guys...

3455
03:21:45,510 --> 03:21:46,610
Do you think it's the maze?

3456
03:21:48,950 --> 03:21:50,430
Do you think it's the maze?

3457
03:21:52,250 --> 03:21:52,810
Because...

3458
03:21:53,290 --> 03:21:55,750
There was that guy with the really long head.

3459
03:22:02,690 --> 03:22:04,210
I don't want to get jump scared.

3460
03:22:04,890 --> 03:22:06,270
You feel safe in here.

3461
03:22:06,790 --> 03:22:08,790
Let's just shut this portal door.

3462
03:22:08,790 --> 03:22:12,110
But I feel like if I sleep and wake up...

3463
03:22:12,110 --> 03:22:12,710
It's Monday.

3464
03:22:12,970 --> 03:22:13,310
Yeah.

3465
03:22:16,470 --> 03:22:18,110
I didn't finish my duties.

3466
03:22:21,630 --> 03:22:23,750
I mean, good enough, right?

3467
03:22:25,390 --> 03:22:26,790
Why is it...

3468
03:22:27,530 --> 03:22:28,790
Why is it...

3469
03:22:32,880 --> 03:22:34,280
Cutting some grass!

3470
03:22:38,800 --> 03:22:40,180
Cutting some grass!

3471
03:22:41,880 --> 03:22:42,840
What's that sound?

3472
03:22:46,880 --> 03:22:50,040
Why does it sound like a sad trumpet?

3473
03:22:56,480 --> 03:22:58,380
I just have a little bit left to go!

3474
03:23:00,340 --> 03:23:02,320
Don't you worry about it!

3475
03:23:02,900 --> 03:23:04,320
We can get this done!

3476
03:23:04,660 --> 03:23:07,280
You said... You didn't really give a time by Monday?

3477
03:23:07,500 --> 03:23:10,120
It could be like Monday... 3.30?

3478
03:23:10,740 --> 03:23:12,640
I can get it done by that time!

3479
03:23:17,800 --> 03:23:19,220
You hear a bus honking.

3480
03:23:19,560 --> 03:23:20,360
No, no, no!

3481
03:23:25,780 --> 03:23:26,260
No!

3482
03:23:30,170 --> 03:23:31,890
I didn't finish my duties!

3483
03:23:33,490 --> 03:23:36,350
Wait, actually, it looks like we can go whenever we want to.

3484
03:23:39,010 --> 03:23:39,970
So, actually...

3485
03:23:39,970 --> 03:23:41,990
Can we actually finish this?

3486
03:23:42,050 --> 03:23:42,970
Can we actually beat this?

3487
03:23:44,770 --> 03:23:46,170
But I don't have enough money.

3488
03:23:46,770 --> 03:23:49,070
Ok, let's actually clear the lawn.

3489
03:23:50,290 --> 03:23:52,030
How much money will we have after that?

3490
03:23:55,750 --> 03:23:58,670
Once I... Once I cut the grass, how much money will I have left?

3491
03:23:59,530 --> 03:24:00,950
How much money will I make?

3492
03:24:01,170 --> 03:24:01,970
Will I have enough money?

3493
03:24:02,270 --> 03:24:02,970
I don't even know!

3494
03:24:04,110 --> 03:24:05,030
Doesn't hurt to try.

3495
03:24:05,150 --> 03:24:05,790
Yeah, why not?

3496
03:24:07,830 --> 03:24:09,590
We are 92% there.

3497
03:24:10,270 --> 03:24:11,470
We are actually so close.

3498
03:24:12,270 --> 03:24:12,710
93...

3499
03:24:16,710 --> 03:24:17,150
95...

3500
03:24:17,150 --> 03:24:18,330
We are killing it.

3501
03:24:19,450 --> 03:24:20,930
And by it, I mean grass.

3502
03:24:22,550 --> 03:24:24,910
Your ass is grass.

3503
03:24:27,030 --> 03:24:28,670
I'm gonna cut it.

3504
03:24:33,550 --> 03:24:35,130
Probably smells great in here.

3505
03:24:35,530 --> 03:24:37,930
Oh, is my vision getting worse or...

3506
03:24:38,910 --> 03:24:40,050
Is it getting brighter?

3507
03:24:41,830 --> 03:24:44,150
Am I able to see less and less or is it just me?

3508
03:24:48,110 --> 03:24:48,750
The

3509
03:24:53,670 --> 03:24:54,310
fog...

3510
03:24:54,310 --> 03:24:55,290
We are so close.

3511
03:24:57,630 --> 03:25:02,830
No, no fog has ever killed anybody except in the fog by Stephen King.

3512
03:25:04,830 --> 03:25:05,710
What's that sound?

3513
03:25:11,290 --> 03:25:13,130
There is something in the fog.

3514
03:25:14,590 --> 03:25:15,910
And it's making noises.

3515
03:25:20,150 --> 03:25:20,750
99...

3516
03:25:22,450 --> 03:25:24,050
How much grass do I have left?

3517
03:25:25,350 --> 03:25:27,770
100% and we got 2 bucks.

3518
03:25:28,130 --> 03:25:28,570
4!

3519
03:25:29,630 --> 03:25:31,110
Guys, I don't have enough money.

3520
03:25:34,990 --> 03:25:36,750
I think there is something in the fog.

3521
03:25:38,790 --> 03:25:40,430
The mist is closing in.

3522
03:25:45,850 --> 03:25:46,550
Fine.

3523
03:25:47,830 --> 03:25:49,250
It cost $10!

3524
03:25:56,390 --> 03:25:57,090
Guys...

3525
03:25:58,090 --> 03:26:00,330
Bye bye world!

3526
03:26:01,970 --> 03:26:04,070
Reach 5 different endings.

3527
03:26:05,570 --> 03:26:07,250
I got lost in the mist.

3528
03:26:12,230 --> 03:26:16,450
OK, we've read all this.

3529
03:26:24,230 --> 03:26:26,730
Sorry snail bro, we gotta save up.

3530
03:26:26,730 --> 03:26:27,410
Alright!

3531
03:26:40,810 --> 03:26:41,650
Is

3532
03:26:49,360 --> 03:26:50,440
it here?

3533
03:26:56,280 --> 03:26:57,540
Okey dokey.

3534
03:26:58,560 --> 03:26:59,780
Okey dokey.

3535
03:26:59,880 --> 03:27:03,400
I think we can maybe speedrun this a little bit.

3536
03:27:05,040 --> 03:27:05,880
Cuz we...

3537
03:27:08,360 --> 03:27:09,200
Cuz we...

3538
03:27:13,030 --> 03:27:15,230
I think we can speedrun this a little bit.

3539
03:27:15,370 --> 03:27:17,130
We don't have to do every mission.

3540
03:27:17,570 --> 03:27:19,470
We just have to do the essential ones, I think.

3541
03:27:21,110 --> 03:27:23,390
Jump scare in 3, 2, 1, BANG!

3542
03:27:25,910 --> 03:27:26,310
OK.

3543
03:27:27,450 --> 03:27:28,330
Yeah, silly grass.

3544
03:27:28,410 --> 03:27:29,390
I'm not gonna go in it though.

3545
03:27:29,870 --> 03:27:33,130
I'm not gonna go in the silly grass because I want him to stay there.

3546
03:27:33,790 --> 03:27:35,390
For when I get...

3547
03:27:40,110 --> 03:27:42,410
When I get...

3548
03:27:42,410 --> 03:27:43,950
The stuff, you know what I mean?

3549
03:27:45,710 --> 03:27:46,630
The trumpet.

3550
03:27:47,190 --> 03:27:48,690
So let's start cutting in here.

3551
03:27:52,190 --> 03:27:54,290
Here's a coin since you missed one on the bus.

3552
03:27:54,810 --> 03:27:55,990
Oh, that's right!

3553
03:27:56,050 --> 03:27:57,630
I did miss one on the bus!

3554
03:27:58,750 --> 03:27:59,550
You're right!

3555
03:27:59,630 --> 03:28:01,090
I completely forgot about that one.

3556
03:28:01,130 --> 03:28:01,890
The one in the back.

3557
03:28:01,990 --> 03:28:04,750
I got it in the first game and I forgot about it ever since.

3558
03:28:05,410 --> 03:28:06,210
Thank you.

3559
03:28:11,110 --> 03:28:13,710
Oh my gosh, I've been playing this game for so long now.

3560
03:28:16,830 --> 03:28:18,510
Let's speedrun, speedrun guys.

3561
03:28:20,610 --> 03:28:22,630
Jump scare in 3, 2, 1...

3562
03:28:23,890 --> 03:28:26,270
Do you think he's the other guy I need to...

3563
03:28:33,450 --> 03:28:34,630
Oh, wrong way.

3564
03:28:38,840 --> 03:28:39,920
The tall idol.

3565
03:28:40,360 --> 03:28:41,800
I think it's the guy...

3566
03:28:43,360 --> 03:28:45,800
I think it's the guy...

3567
03:28:50,040 --> 03:28:50,840
What's his name?

3568
03:28:51,160 --> 03:28:51,840
In the maze.

3569
03:28:52,080 --> 03:28:52,580
Or...

3570
03:28:52,580 --> 03:28:53,940
Do you think it's... Oh, who are you?

3571
03:28:54,320 --> 03:28:54,640
Oh.

3572
03:28:59,340 --> 03:29:01,520
Do you think it's the scarecrow?

3573
03:29:02,900 --> 03:29:04,680
I still have no idea what to do with this corn.

3574
03:29:09,000 --> 03:29:10,420
Do I get him when he's tall?

3575
03:29:11,620 --> 03:29:13,900
Like when he's... Peeking?

3576
03:29:14,660 --> 03:29:15,320
I'm not sure.

3577
03:29:16,820 --> 03:29:17,880
Yes, the guy in the maze.

3578
03:29:18,000 --> 03:29:18,260
Sorry.

3579
03:29:18,540 --> 03:29:20,820
My brain is all over the place right now because I'm like...

3580
03:29:20,820 --> 03:29:21,800
Ok, do this part.

3581
03:29:22,080 --> 03:29:23,100
Ok, then do this part.

3582
03:29:23,360 --> 03:29:24,500
Ok, then do this part.

3583
03:29:24,840 --> 03:29:26,640
So from here let's go get the trowel.

3584
03:29:29,400 --> 03:29:30,100
Over here?

3585
03:29:30,220 --> 03:29:31,580
Oh, I forgot to get the bone.

3586
03:29:34,720 --> 03:29:36,580
Where was the other bone?

3587
03:29:37,720 --> 03:29:39,100
There were two bones.

3588
03:29:41,240 --> 03:29:42,680
Her brains are racing as well.

3589
03:29:44,840 --> 03:29:47,280
Yeah, I'm gonna try and give the kids their instruments.

3590
03:29:49,680 --> 03:29:51,020
Oh, I didn't get the hammer!

3591
03:29:53,040 --> 03:29:56,660
I said speedrun, but I'm actually...

3592
03:29:59,080 --> 03:30:01,000
I'm not doing so hot, guys.

3593
03:30:01,500 --> 03:30:02,800
But here we can get the shidle.

3594
03:30:08,460 --> 03:30:09,060
Got him.

3595
03:30:12,680 --> 03:30:15,060
It's funny that you actually do have to get the gnome.

3596
03:30:15,100 --> 03:30:16,140
To get the gnome idol.

3597
03:30:25,020 --> 03:30:28,200
Maybe this game isn't about gardening at all, you guys.

3598
03:30:29,340 --> 03:30:31,740
Maybe this game isn't about gardening at all!

3599
03:30:34,460 --> 03:30:36,800
Insert joke about six months.

3600
03:30:37,020 --> 03:30:37,500
Love me.

3601
03:30:57,020 --> 03:30:57,960
Let's see.

3602
03:30:58,700 --> 03:31:00,060
Is there a lighter here?

3603
03:31:01,200 --> 03:31:02,980
Yes, there is!

3604
03:31:02,980 --> 03:31:04,980
There's a...

3605
03:31:06,700 --> 03:31:09,100
In the end, there does end up being a lighter.

3606
03:31:09,520 --> 03:31:11,120
If you don't get it from the hole.

3607
03:31:12,860 --> 03:31:13,540
Pick it up.

3608
03:31:13,840 --> 03:31:14,120
There we go.

3609
03:31:16,980 --> 03:31:18,980
I thought that might be the case, so...

3610
03:31:22,160 --> 03:31:24,740
Something in the area has changed.

3611
03:31:25,280 --> 03:31:27,720
And I can light this up.

3612
03:31:28,920 --> 03:31:29,700
Oh, just kidding.

3613
03:31:30,520 --> 03:31:31,080
Light.

3614
03:31:31,640 --> 03:31:32,180
Light.

3615
03:31:39,330 --> 03:31:40,730
Okay, how much do I got?

3616
03:31:41,630 --> 03:31:42,530
I've got two.

3617
03:31:42,950 --> 03:31:45,990
But we have a portal to over here.

3618
03:31:46,850 --> 03:31:49,850
And I didn't get the bone, because I'm a bone head.

3619
03:31:49,970 --> 03:31:50,690
But that's okay.

3620
03:31:51,310 --> 03:31:52,330
Let's get this guy.

3621
03:31:53,370 --> 03:31:54,770
Our little friend down here.

3622
03:32:05,370 --> 03:32:05,650
Sorry.

3623
03:32:06,750 --> 03:32:07,010
Oh no!

3624
03:32:07,270 --> 03:32:07,510
Oh no!

3625
03:32:07,590 --> 03:32:07,730
Oh no!

3626
03:32:11,030 --> 03:32:12,810
Oh my god.

3627
03:32:14,350 --> 03:32:14,750
Don't shut.

3628
03:32:14,850 --> 03:32:15,110
Don't shut.

3629
03:32:15,190 --> 03:32:15,450
Don't shut.

3630
03:32:28,510 --> 03:32:29,950
What should be the next step?

3631
03:32:30,970 --> 03:32:33,030
I'm gonna cut the hedges so I can get more money.

3632
03:32:38,770 --> 03:32:42,330
And then I'm gonna go to the gas station and kill the gnome army.

3633
03:32:46,510 --> 03:32:48,710
I wanna kinda hurry up, because...

3634
03:32:49,450 --> 03:32:51,010
Atara asked me to be on her stream.

3635
03:32:54,590 --> 03:32:55,030
So...

3636
03:32:55,030 --> 03:32:57,350
But I was like, oh, I'm streaming.

3637
03:32:57,830 --> 03:33:00,430
So right after this, I'm gonna jump on call with her.

3638
03:33:03,090 --> 03:33:03,490
So...

3639
03:33:03,490 --> 03:33:06,410
I wanna speedrun as much as I can.

3640
03:33:08,190 --> 03:33:11,070
We got the travel, so let's dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.

3641
03:33:12,650 --> 03:33:14,170
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.

3642
03:33:15,150 --> 03:33:16,810
How did we get the apple?

3643
03:33:17,110 --> 03:33:18,170
Oh, okay.

3644
03:33:18,290 --> 03:33:20,090
We need the key to the office for the apple.

3645
03:33:23,050 --> 03:33:23,850
To get...

3646
03:33:23,850 --> 03:33:25,130
She said you hate her.

3647
03:33:25,270 --> 03:33:25,470
She?

3648
03:33:25,850 --> 03:33:26,250
Okay.

3649
03:33:27,530 --> 03:33:30,010
She didn't ask me to be on her stream.

3650
03:33:30,010 --> 03:33:33,930
And then she was just like, hey, when are you coming on my stream?

3651
03:33:34,030 --> 03:33:34,970
And I'm like, huh?

3652
03:33:41,090 --> 03:33:45,210
That was me earlier when I was checking my...

3653
03:33:45,210 --> 03:33:48,010
When I was... Earlier I was just like, wait, I...

3654
03:33:52,810 --> 03:33:56,010
I was checking my...

3655
03:33:57,510 --> 03:33:58,350
Oh, I got it already.

3656
03:33:59,790 --> 03:34:00,430
My DMs.

3657
03:34:00,990 --> 03:34:02,290
She was like, when are you coming?

3658
03:34:02,530 --> 03:34:03,210
I was like, what do you mean?

3659
03:34:04,210 --> 03:34:05,890
She was like, I'm coming on my stream.

3660
03:34:06,330 --> 03:34:07,450
I was like...

3661
03:34:07,890 --> 03:34:09,130
I mean, I'm happy to do it.

3662
03:34:09,390 --> 03:34:10,070
You just didn't ask.

3663
03:34:13,150 --> 03:34:15,190
Okay, got all rid of all the mohos.

3664
03:34:17,670 --> 03:34:19,490
I'm getting all the trash now.

3665
03:34:19,950 --> 03:34:21,650
I'm just collecting money at this point.

3666
03:34:23,230 --> 03:34:25,450
So we can get the office key when we go over there.

3667
03:34:28,670 --> 03:34:29,810
Cleared all the trash.

3668
03:34:29,870 --> 03:34:30,050
Okay.

3669
03:34:30,370 --> 03:34:33,270
We at least have enough money for...

3670
03:34:35,050 --> 03:34:35,430
The...

3671
03:34:35,430 --> 03:34:36,050
Thing.

3672
03:34:37,510 --> 03:34:37,890
No!

3673
03:34:39,450 --> 03:34:41,110
Her boat is on the other side.

3674
03:34:41,890 --> 03:34:42,690
Okay, that's fine.

3675
03:34:42,730 --> 03:34:43,670
We have another shortcut.

3676
03:34:45,110 --> 03:34:46,570
Oh, let me get the bone too.

3677
03:34:47,750 --> 03:34:48,810
You also need the disc.

3678
03:34:48,910 --> 03:34:49,490
Yeah, I know.

3679
03:34:51,410 --> 03:34:53,670
Let's get the bone so we can pass the dog.

3680
03:34:56,750 --> 03:34:57,190
Sorry.

3681
03:34:57,510 --> 03:34:58,050
Excuse me.

3682
03:34:58,230 --> 03:34:58,970
Thank you.

3683
03:34:59,730 --> 03:35:00,530
How are you doing, snail?

3684
03:35:01,930 --> 03:35:03,270
I forgot he has a coin.

3685
03:35:04,210 --> 03:35:05,030
How many do I have?

3686
03:35:05,390 --> 03:35:05,790
Ten!

3687
03:35:06,710 --> 03:35:07,970
I should be able to buy both.

3688
03:35:08,970 --> 03:35:09,390
Perfect.

3689
03:35:10,410 --> 03:35:11,510
Guys, we're killing it.

3690
03:35:12,030 --> 03:35:13,230
And I got that already.

3691
03:35:14,430 --> 03:35:15,230
Nice, nice.

3692
03:35:16,030 --> 03:35:16,610
Good morning, Minto.

3693
03:35:16,750 --> 03:35:17,290
Good morning!

3694
03:35:19,230 --> 03:35:20,050
We're gaming.

3695
03:35:22,610 --> 03:35:24,590
Or a medal for the snail.

3696
03:35:26,230 --> 03:35:27,170
So true.

3697
03:35:34,390 --> 03:35:39,130
I wonder what the... I know there's probably a death ending with the snail...

3698
03:35:39,130 --> 03:35:39,850
Or with the...

3699
03:35:39,850 --> 03:35:41,270
With the gnomes.

3700
03:35:42,730 --> 03:35:44,850
I wonder if...

3701
03:35:44,850 --> 03:35:46,710
I wonder what happens.

3702
03:35:47,190 --> 03:35:49,030
Maybe they just start invading the whole town.

3703
03:35:51,910 --> 03:35:52,550
There we go.

3704
03:35:52,950 --> 03:35:53,890
I still didn't get the plank.

3705
03:35:56,050 --> 03:35:58,390
I'm all over the place with this.

3706
03:35:58,790 --> 03:35:59,530
Are these the myst...

3707
03:36:02,410 --> 03:36:04,470
This has the symbol of the flower door.

3708
03:36:06,370 --> 03:36:07,890
Guys, remember that.

3709
03:36:08,310 --> 03:36:11,890
I wonder if the mysterious... Watering the mysterious flowers...

3710
03:36:12,830 --> 03:36:14,030
Is the key.

3711
03:36:15,250 --> 03:36:15,950
I think.

3712
03:36:22,840 --> 03:36:25,060
The mysterious flowers are the key.

3713
03:36:27,760 --> 03:36:33,400
The mysterious flowers are the key.

3714
03:36:33,400 --> 03:36:37,760
We'll come back for the compass, because we will need it.

3715
03:36:40,860 --> 03:36:41,680
Hi dog.

3716
03:36:42,480 --> 03:36:42,860
There you go.

3717
03:36:44,320 --> 03:36:44,840
There you go.

3718
03:36:45,400 --> 03:36:47,020
And we need this for the...

3719
03:36:47,020 --> 03:36:49,160
For the small idol.

3720
03:36:55,200 --> 03:36:56,480
Small idol!

3721
03:37:00,100 --> 03:37:02,080
Voice is not...

3722
03:37:02,080 --> 03:37:04,220
Not here for...

3723
03:37:05,960 --> 03:37:07,780
Singing right now.

3724
03:37:08,740 --> 03:37:09,940
Small idol!

3725
03:37:11,780 --> 03:37:13,540
Let's go, go, go.

3726
03:37:13,680 --> 03:37:14,600
There's a coin.

3727
03:37:14,960 --> 03:37:15,960
Did I get the coin here already?

3728
03:37:16,900 --> 03:37:17,540
I guess I did.

3729
03:37:21,540 --> 03:37:22,740
Small idol.

3730
03:37:22,940 --> 03:37:25,420
And I want to get that purifying stone.

3731
03:37:27,140 --> 03:37:28,160
Let's get it right now.

3732
03:37:32,550 --> 03:37:34,490
I feel like we need this.

3733
03:37:34,750 --> 03:37:36,470
Because it's called a purifying stone.

3734
03:37:37,030 --> 03:37:38,410
It seems important.

3735
03:37:39,730 --> 03:37:42,550
It seems like it could be...

3736
03:37:43,070 --> 03:37:43,970
Of some use.

3737
03:37:47,870 --> 03:37:49,470
And there's a coin down here.

3738
03:37:50,750 --> 03:37:51,610
Hey sad kid.

3739
03:37:51,970 --> 03:37:52,490
There you go.

3740
03:37:52,850 --> 03:37:53,590
Stupid kid.

3741
03:37:53,990 --> 03:37:54,910
Go away small idol.

3742
03:37:56,490 --> 03:37:57,770
Thank you.

3743
03:38:00,950 --> 03:38:01,590
Grab...

3744
03:38:01,590 --> 03:38:02,610
Coin?

3745
03:38:03,130 --> 03:38:04,290
How many do we have?

3746
03:38:06,190 --> 03:38:06,830
Five!

3747
03:38:07,290 --> 03:38:08,150
I think that's enough.

3748
03:38:11,350 --> 03:38:12,630
For the...

3749
03:38:12,630 --> 03:38:12,970
Compass.

3750
03:38:15,790 --> 03:38:16,910
The idol was aggro.

3751
03:38:17,390 --> 03:38:17,810
It's okay.

3752
03:38:18,470 --> 03:38:19,450
It's because he's small.

3753
03:38:20,810 --> 03:38:22,030
He's closer to hell.

3754
03:38:24,710 --> 03:38:26,170
Oh the egg ball.

3755
03:38:26,170 --> 03:38:27,970
Oh my gosh you're right.

3756
03:38:28,230 --> 03:38:29,010
Oh no.

3757
03:38:29,390 --> 03:38:29,850
Coin?

3758
03:38:38,170 --> 03:38:40,630
Is there any coin in here you think?

3759
03:38:41,410 --> 03:38:43,790
Can I rob this mysterious woods?

3760
03:38:58,270 --> 03:38:58,990
Anything...

3761
03:38:58,990 --> 03:39:01,210
If you're dead can I rob you?

3762
03:39:02,430 --> 03:39:03,530
Do you have any coins?

3763
03:39:04,490 --> 03:39:05,030
Any coin?

3764
03:39:05,590 --> 03:39:06,150
Any coins?

3765
03:39:06,270 --> 03:39:06,450
No?

3766
03:39:06,650 --> 03:39:06,890
Okay.

3767
03:39:07,750 --> 03:39:08,330
That's fine.

3768
03:39:09,590 --> 03:39:10,710
Oh whoops wrong way.

3769
03:39:13,610 --> 03:39:14,470
Take the bone?

3770
03:39:14,850 --> 03:39:16,170
I already got bones.

3771
03:39:16,430 --> 03:39:17,290
Guess we'll get another bone.

3772
03:39:28,700 --> 03:39:29,900
We read that.

3773
03:39:29,980 --> 03:39:31,460
Wait okay so...

3774
03:39:31,460 --> 03:39:34,100
Tall man always observe it as if chasing a prey.

3775
03:39:38,380 --> 03:39:39,700
Always observe it.

3776
03:39:42,140 --> 03:39:45,140
Do you think we just find him randomly then?

3777
03:39:45,900 --> 03:39:47,720
We got... Well always running about.

3778
03:39:47,840 --> 03:39:49,820
Okay well the short man wasn't always running about.

3779
03:39:49,920 --> 03:39:50,580
Maybe it's fine.

3780
03:39:51,960 --> 03:39:52,660
And the worm.

3781
03:39:57,050 --> 03:39:57,990
Oh shoot I forgot.

3782
03:39:58,510 --> 03:39:59,510
Oh my god.

3783
03:40:00,370 --> 03:40:01,510
Get me out of here please.

3784
03:40:02,330 --> 03:40:04,150
I forgot that the ghost shows up in here.

3785
03:40:06,190 --> 03:40:08,270
Is there any things?

3786
03:40:08,910 --> 03:40:09,750
Bunch of onions.

3787
03:40:10,090 --> 03:40:11,250
Any where to rob?

3788
03:40:11,790 --> 03:40:12,330
Any money?

3789
03:40:12,430 --> 03:40:13,030
Do you have any money?

3790
03:40:13,110 --> 03:40:14,850
You have this rich ass house and you have no money?

3791
03:40:15,470 --> 03:40:15,770
Please.

3792
03:40:17,590 --> 03:40:18,050
Jammed.

3793
03:40:19,250 --> 03:40:19,710
Jammed.

3794
03:40:20,870 --> 03:40:21,550
Church key.

3795
03:40:22,210 --> 03:40:23,050
We do need that though.

3796
03:40:27,470 --> 03:40:28,390
Oh gosh.

3797
03:40:28,970 --> 03:40:30,170
Use the stove?

3798
03:40:32,810 --> 03:40:33,730
You think so?

3799
03:40:36,990 --> 03:40:38,750
To... Wait where is the stove?

3800
03:40:39,350 --> 03:40:39,590
Here?

3801
03:40:40,450 --> 03:40:41,050
Oh my god.

3802
03:40:41,650 --> 03:40:43,330
It's a big empty frying pan.

3803
03:40:43,970 --> 03:40:45,790
I don't think I grabbed the corn.

3804
03:40:46,790 --> 03:40:47,930
I have to come back.

3805
03:40:52,250 --> 03:40:52,970
Oh my gosh.

3806
03:40:53,870 --> 03:40:54,530
Scared me.

3807
03:40:54,690 --> 03:40:55,870
Okay now...

3808
03:40:58,050 --> 03:40:59,430
We put that apple.

3809
03:41:02,030 --> 03:41:03,430
Here and we get the worm.

3810
03:41:06,790 --> 03:41:10,350
And then we let him eat the worm.

3811
03:41:14,730 --> 03:41:15,450
Popcorn?

3812
03:41:16,610 --> 03:41:18,050
Wait what do you mean popcorn?

3813
03:41:23,530 --> 03:41:24,550
Strange key.

3814
03:41:25,990 --> 03:41:27,750
Oh I got the worm back.

3815
03:41:28,730 --> 03:41:29,410
That's so funny.

3816
03:41:36,230 --> 03:41:37,290
Corn on the stove?

3817
03:41:37,890 --> 03:41:39,130
No it's corn on the cob.

3818
03:41:40,910 --> 03:41:44,390
I think we might be able to go to the park normally now.

3819
03:41:45,530 --> 03:41:46,570
No not yet.

3820
03:41:46,670 --> 03:41:47,290
Oh my gosh.

3821
03:41:48,470 --> 03:41:48,910
Please.

3822
03:41:51,310 --> 03:41:52,190
Let's um...

3823
03:41:53,530 --> 03:41:55,110
I'm trying to figure out what I want to do.

3824
03:41:55,110 --> 03:41:55,170
Oh.

3825
03:42:00,510 --> 03:42:01,970
Can the fisherman use the worm?

3826
03:42:02,110 --> 03:42:02,590
Oh maybe.

3827
03:42:04,210 --> 03:42:05,030
Give it to them.

3828
03:42:05,770 --> 03:42:07,430
I gotta go all the way over there though.

3829
03:42:08,190 --> 03:42:10,530
I don't think he's there this late.

3830
03:42:12,790 --> 03:42:13,830
But we can check.

3831
03:42:14,670 --> 03:42:16,030
I gotta get the watering can.

3832
03:42:16,070 --> 03:42:16,790
I didn't get that right?

3833
03:42:17,630 --> 03:42:18,430
No okay.

3834
03:42:18,770 --> 03:42:19,710
Let's go back to the park.

3835
03:42:28,890 --> 03:42:30,270
Yeah he's gone.

3836
03:42:30,610 --> 03:42:31,330
But we can try.

3837
03:42:33,050 --> 03:42:33,690
Tomorrow.

3838
03:42:34,970 --> 03:42:37,230
I know there is a...

3839
03:42:39,150 --> 03:42:43,110
There's a coin in the gazebo.

3840
03:42:43,830 --> 03:42:44,770
In here.

3841
03:42:44,950 --> 03:42:46,290
But I don't think I got it.

3842
03:42:47,630 --> 03:42:47,950
Nope.

3843
03:42:48,050 --> 03:42:48,510
Okay perfect.

3844
03:42:49,310 --> 03:42:50,310
How many do we have?

3845
03:42:51,710 --> 03:42:52,350
Seven!

3846
03:42:52,730 --> 03:42:54,770
Oh my gosh I just need...

3847
03:42:54,770 --> 03:42:55,930
Three more.

3848
03:42:57,210 --> 03:42:58,770
But I have to buy this.

3849
03:43:00,510 --> 03:43:01,090
Oh wait.

3850
03:43:01,190 --> 03:43:02,530
I have to buy the egg ball.

3851
03:43:07,290 --> 03:43:08,250
What is that sound?

3852
03:43:08,390 --> 03:43:09,230
Oh they are cooking.

3853
03:43:11,110 --> 03:43:13,470
I think if I...

3854
03:43:14,010 --> 03:43:14,710
The tree hole!

3855
03:43:14,810 --> 03:43:15,150
Yes!

3856
03:43:15,750 --> 03:43:16,730
Oh my gosh thank you.

3857
03:43:18,190 --> 03:43:19,430
It was like over here I think.

3858
03:43:23,310 --> 03:43:26,350
I think... And then if I cut the grass I should have enough for everything.

3859
03:43:28,510 --> 03:43:31,470
After I cut the grass I should be able to buy...

3860
03:43:32,590 --> 03:43:33,030
Everything.

3861
03:43:35,090 --> 03:43:35,530
Yes.

3862
03:43:40,530 --> 03:43:40,970
What...

3863
03:43:42,630 --> 03:43:43,070
Else...

3864
03:43:43,070 --> 03:43:43,870
Are we doing?

3865
03:43:48,630 --> 03:43:49,670
What else are we doing?

3866
03:43:50,370 --> 03:43:51,550
Oh watering can thank you guys.

3867
03:43:52,930 --> 03:43:53,790
Thank you thank you.

3868
03:43:53,870 --> 03:43:55,690
I was like I came over here...

3869
03:43:55,690 --> 03:43:56,550
For a reason.

3870
03:43:56,550 --> 03:43:59,590
To water mysterious plants.

3871
03:44:10,830 --> 03:44:12,650
The bridge is now usable.

3872
03:44:14,010 --> 03:44:14,810
Good good good.

3873
03:44:16,190 --> 03:44:19,110
Any other mysterious plants around here?

3874
03:44:20,710 --> 03:44:22,830
Any mysterious plants?

3875
03:44:25,130 --> 03:44:26,630
Did you grab the symbol?

3876
03:44:27,650 --> 03:44:28,790
No not yet.

3877
03:44:30,270 --> 03:44:32,690
I don't think I even grabbed the plank.

3878
03:44:32,690 --> 03:44:34,150
To be honest.

3879
03:44:35,450 --> 03:44:37,010
I guess I don't need to fix this bridge.

3880
03:44:37,210 --> 03:44:39,790
Actually I probably should in case there is like a...

3881
03:44:39,790 --> 03:44:40,870
Chase sequence or something.

3882
03:44:41,610 --> 03:44:42,910
To the...

3883
03:44:43,710 --> 03:44:45,730
I can't even afford a ticket.

3884
03:44:46,130 --> 03:44:47,490
To leave.

3885
03:44:53,390 --> 03:44:54,370
Mysterious flower.

3886
03:44:56,150 --> 03:44:57,090
Thank you.

3887
03:44:57,090 --> 03:44:57,850
Well...

3888
03:45:00,230 --> 03:45:02,810
So we'll have to wait for the midnight for the church.

3889
03:45:10,250 --> 03:45:11,350
Back towards the church.

3890
03:45:11,470 --> 03:45:12,410
Wait was there another one?

3891
03:45:18,280 --> 03:45:20,140
Because I imagine...

3892
03:45:20,600 --> 03:45:22,760
I imagine that...

3893
03:45:24,420 --> 03:45:24,860
The...

3894
03:45:24,860 --> 03:45:25,340
Wait.

3895
03:45:25,900 --> 03:45:27,580
Oh yeah I did get all the trash didn't I?

3896
03:45:28,760 --> 03:45:33,460
I imagine that the mist will not be around if we pacify.

3897
03:45:33,620 --> 03:45:36,440
Oh I just was there and I forgot the plank again.

3898
03:45:37,640 --> 03:45:39,940
The mist won't happen if we...

3899
03:45:41,140 --> 03:45:42,480
Do everything correctly.

3900
03:45:43,440 --> 03:45:44,280
Is my guess.

3901
03:45:45,360 --> 03:45:45,660
Coin!

3902
03:45:47,700 --> 03:45:48,000
Okay.

3903
03:45:48,720 --> 03:45:49,520
We are at four.

3904
03:45:50,380 --> 03:45:51,060
And the corn.

3905
03:45:53,120 --> 03:45:54,120
Okay let's go.

3906
03:45:54,680 --> 03:45:55,860
Let's go get those two things.

3907
03:45:55,860 --> 03:45:56,640
Corn.

3908
03:45:56,780 --> 03:45:57,220
Plank.

3909
03:45:57,420 --> 03:45:57,720
Corn.

3910
03:45:57,920 --> 03:45:58,200
Plank.

3911
03:45:58,520 --> 03:45:58,820
Plank.

3912
03:45:58,960 --> 03:45:59,120
Corn.

3913
03:45:59,440 --> 03:45:59,760
Corn.

3914
03:45:59,880 --> 03:46:00,360
Plank.

3915
03:46:00,660 --> 03:46:01,000
Corn.

3916
03:46:01,100 --> 03:46:01,360
Plank.

3917
03:46:03,660 --> 03:46:05,400
How do I get the trumpet again?

3918
03:46:05,440 --> 03:46:07,040
Oh I know it was in the gnome area.

3919
03:46:07,320 --> 03:46:07,680
I remember.

3920
03:46:17,080 --> 03:46:17,960
I'm lost.

3921
03:46:19,620 --> 03:46:21,200
Oh my god that lady scared me.

3922
03:46:23,140 --> 03:46:25,700
Can you like peek your...Oh there he is.

3923
03:46:29,810 --> 03:46:30,890
I did get the corn!

3924
03:46:33,330 --> 03:46:35,210
I did get the corn.

3925
03:46:42,440 --> 03:46:43,080
Plank.

3926
03:46:49,760 --> 03:46:50,400
See?

3927
03:46:52,000 --> 03:46:54,980
Maybe I need something else to go with it.

3928
03:47:01,270 --> 03:47:03,440
To properly cook it.

3929
03:47:05,450 --> 03:47:06,410
Drunk girl?

3930
03:47:06,510 --> 03:47:07,010
She's Sunday.

3931
03:47:08,450 --> 03:47:09,730
She's not yet.

3932
03:47:13,870 --> 03:47:14,570
See?

3933
03:47:15,570 --> 03:47:17,150
Like butter or something?

3934
03:47:17,250 --> 03:47:17,690
Maybe.

3935
03:47:18,810 --> 03:47:20,610
I'm gonna put this plank down.

3936
03:47:20,990 --> 03:47:22,300
Like I said we're gonna wait until...

3937
03:47:24,330 --> 03:47:26,150
We'll cut grass while we wait.

3938
03:47:27,010 --> 03:47:27,970
Until midnight.

3939
03:47:29,490 --> 03:47:30,390
I guess.

3940
03:47:30,950 --> 03:47:33,230
So we can get enough coins to buy...

3941
03:47:34,670 --> 03:47:35,490
The compass.

3942
03:47:35,930 --> 03:47:38,050
Oh actually let's go to the gnome area.

3943
03:47:38,710 --> 03:47:40,050
And grab the trumpet.

3944
03:47:52,190 --> 03:47:52,770
Oh!

3945
03:47:53,010 --> 03:47:54,550
I can also...Oh I don't need to do this.

3946
03:47:54,610 --> 03:47:55,570
I can water the plants!

3947
03:47:56,390 --> 03:47:57,410
It's way easier.

3948
03:48:02,950 --> 03:48:05,730
Yeah, watering the flowers will be way easier.

3949
03:48:06,170 --> 03:48:07,570
I didn't even get the gnome idol.

3950
03:48:08,030 --> 03:48:09,490
I'm like imagining things.

3951
03:48:09,730 --> 03:48:13,430
I'm like imagining myself doing stuff and I'm actually not doing it.

3952
03:48:26,300 --> 03:48:28,280
I'm getting all my runs mixed up.

3953
03:48:32,760 --> 03:48:33,500
It's okay.

3954
03:48:34,100 --> 03:48:35,680
We still have to wait until midnight anyway.

3955
03:48:35,680 --> 03:48:35,740
Okay.

3956
03:48:37,740 --> 03:48:40,200
To grab the plank in the church room.

3957
03:48:41,760 --> 03:48:43,600
We gotta open that up anyway too.

3958
03:48:47,040 --> 03:48:47,700
What the?

3959
03:48:48,300 --> 03:48:49,620
Oh this stupid thing is on.

3960
03:48:50,400 --> 03:48:51,600
He never calls me.

3961
03:48:51,720 --> 03:48:53,500
Didn't he write like on the thing?

3962
03:48:54,080 --> 03:48:55,740
I'll call you if I need something.

3963
03:48:57,700 --> 03:49:01,340
Oh I watered all the flowers and that was also a mysterious flower.

3964
03:49:04,360 --> 03:49:05,560
Not yet.

3965
03:49:08,660 --> 03:49:11,620
You forgot to do that Skelly for the seventh time.

3966
03:49:14,160 --> 03:49:15,920
I'm too busy gaming.

3967
03:49:16,160 --> 03:49:16,740
I'm sorry.

3968
03:49:18,320 --> 03:49:19,920
I'm too busy gaming.

3969
03:49:22,600 --> 03:49:25,380
One more mysterious flower somewhere.

3970
03:49:26,380 --> 03:49:28,220
Let's go get the compass.

3971
03:49:31,960 --> 03:49:33,500
The door is right over here.

3972
03:49:34,680 --> 03:49:35,820
I think we have time.

3973
03:49:39,900 --> 03:49:41,240
One compass please.

3974
03:49:42,040 --> 03:49:42,840
Thank you.

3975
03:49:50,090 --> 03:49:51,210
And to church.

3976
03:49:52,530 --> 03:49:53,410
What time is it?

3977
03:49:54,830 --> 03:49:55,190
Okay.

3978
03:49:55,850 --> 03:49:56,370
45.

3979
03:49:56,710 --> 03:49:57,250
Alright, perfect.

3980
03:50:01,830 --> 03:50:03,050
Run into the church.

3981
03:50:03,170 --> 03:50:03,350
Okay.

3982
03:50:03,750 --> 03:50:04,270
We're almost there.

3983
03:50:04,530 --> 03:50:05,570
Don't jump scare me please.

3984
03:50:12,870 --> 03:50:13,870
I'm running.

3985
03:50:14,030 --> 03:50:14,990
I'm going home please.

3986
03:50:15,490 --> 03:50:16,330
Please miss.

3987
03:50:16,430 --> 03:50:17,170
Don't get me.

3988
03:50:17,630 --> 03:50:18,150
Please.

3989
03:50:19,130 --> 03:50:20,670
Ghost don't get me.

3990
03:50:20,970 --> 03:50:21,730
Nobody get me.

3991
03:50:28,770 --> 03:50:29,530
Optimizing.

3992
03:50:31,670 --> 03:50:32,670
Good night.

3993
03:50:34,490 --> 03:50:35,510
That damn kid.

3994
03:50:44,650 --> 03:50:45,870
I'll take your hand.

3995
03:50:54,050 --> 03:50:55,430
But I remember.

3996
03:50:57,330 --> 03:50:59,110
We went through the maze.

3997
03:51:00,110 --> 03:51:00,490
Wait.

3998
03:51:02,610 --> 03:51:03,330
Hold on.

3999
03:51:03,930 --> 03:51:04,490
The compass.

4000
03:51:05,770 --> 03:51:08,070
When we had the compass it led us to the fountain.

4001
03:51:08,170 --> 03:51:08,910
The water fountain.

4002
03:51:12,230 --> 03:51:13,970
It led us to the water fountain.

4003
03:51:14,070 --> 03:51:14,930
We couldn't do anything.

4004
03:51:16,950 --> 03:51:18,130
There was a guy there.

4005
03:51:18,210 --> 03:51:19,670
Yeah, but it didn't do anything.

4006
03:51:24,050 --> 03:51:27,590
I tried watering the water fountain.

4007
03:51:29,250 --> 03:51:30,750
That did not work.

4008
03:51:32,530 --> 03:51:34,050
I tried my...

4009
03:51:35,830 --> 03:51:38,050
I think I tried my...

4010
03:51:38,770 --> 03:51:40,070
Trumpet didn't work.

4011
03:51:42,270 --> 03:51:44,550
I guess we'll just try... I mean we gotta go back in again.

4012
03:51:44,770 --> 03:51:45,810
Hey, where are the kids at?

4013
03:51:46,670 --> 03:51:46,970
Hello?

4014
03:51:47,470 --> 03:51:49,370
I'm here for the performance.

4015
03:51:51,070 --> 03:51:52,690
These lazy children.

4016
03:51:54,910 --> 03:51:55,870
Excuse me.

4017
03:51:59,850 --> 03:52:01,850
I'm at the park for the children.

4018
03:52:05,750 --> 03:52:06,610
It's Sunday.

4019
03:52:06,770 --> 03:52:08,370
Yeah, and that's when they perform.

4020
03:52:10,670 --> 03:52:13,090
I think the last plant is in this park.

4021
03:52:13,550 --> 03:52:18,190
Yeah, I'm kind of like searching around for it as I...

4022
03:52:18,190 --> 03:52:19,230
The fish.

4023
03:52:19,770 --> 03:52:20,950
What did this do?

4024
03:52:23,230 --> 03:52:24,610
Now that I think about it.

4025
03:52:25,010 --> 03:52:25,910
What did this do?

4026
03:52:38,900 --> 03:52:40,420
It summoned the children!

4027
03:52:41,360 --> 03:52:41,980
Here you go.

4028
03:52:42,120 --> 03:52:44,340
Your triangle, your trumpet, your cymbals.

4029
03:52:45,120 --> 03:52:46,660
I brought back the school band.

4030
03:52:47,100 --> 03:52:48,160
Bring the band back together.

4031
03:52:48,280 --> 03:52:49,740
Make the school band perform again.

4032
03:52:55,650 --> 03:52:56,830
I regret it.

4033
03:52:57,890 --> 03:52:58,910
That was it?

4034
03:53:00,490 --> 03:53:01,810
Plant near the gas station.

4035
03:53:02,310 --> 03:53:03,450
I thought I got that one.

4036
03:53:05,610 --> 03:53:08,890
At least I got an achievement for it, I guess.

4037
03:53:11,310 --> 03:53:15,450
There seem to be a few optional things.

4038
03:53:26,530 --> 03:53:27,730
Near the snail door.

4039
03:53:29,990 --> 03:53:33,730
Are they gonna get mad at me for not calming all the...

4040
03:53:34,790 --> 03:53:36,390
All the spirits, I wonder.

4041
03:53:36,710 --> 03:53:39,150
Since I kept missing that one guy in the gnome room.

4042
03:53:40,510 --> 03:53:41,410
Okay, well.

4043
03:53:42,270 --> 03:53:43,370
There was some... Oh, here.

4044
03:53:45,070 --> 03:53:46,770
You watered all mysterious flowers.

4045
03:53:51,010 --> 03:53:51,510
I...

4046
03:53:52,810 --> 03:53:55,810
Cause there's stuff like the pizza box we didn't get.

4047
03:53:59,110 --> 03:54:00,610
We still have the Polaroid.

4048
03:54:00,710 --> 03:54:01,390
I saw a gnome?

4049
03:54:01,850 --> 03:54:02,950
I see gnomes?

4050
03:54:03,770 --> 03:54:04,350
Oh my gosh.

4051
03:54:09,510 --> 03:54:09,970
Flower.

4052
03:54:17,770 --> 03:54:19,050
Do you think they're...

4053
03:54:20,130 --> 03:54:21,130
Do you think they're good?

4054
03:54:21,590 --> 03:54:23,390
No, I don't think so.

4055
03:54:28,250 --> 03:54:29,310
I don't think they're good.

4056
03:54:31,570 --> 03:54:33,990
I got bad vibes, bad vibes.

4057
03:54:33,990 --> 03:54:34,110
Spirits.

4058
03:54:36,930 --> 03:54:40,430
I think if I had left with that, they would have attacked me afterwards.

4059
03:54:42,130 --> 03:54:44,230
I think they would have killed me while walking out.

4060
03:54:44,910 --> 03:54:45,890
Destroy them all.

4061
03:54:47,770 --> 03:54:48,210
Money.

4062
03:54:51,010 --> 03:54:52,990
Wait, so now that I...

4063
03:54:53,710 --> 03:54:58,490
Did that stuff for the kids, I don't think I'm gonna have enough money to buy a ticket to leave.

4064
03:55:03,990 --> 03:55:05,250
Let's cut some grass.

4065
03:55:06,870 --> 03:55:09,250
We're just 80% of the way there.

4066
03:55:11,290 --> 03:55:12,010
82?

4067
03:55:14,130 --> 03:55:15,910
Just like real life.

4068
03:55:16,510 --> 03:55:19,610
I've given these damn kids my last pennies.

4069
03:55:21,210 --> 03:55:23,650
I'm a gardener who's not getting paid.

4070
03:55:24,390 --> 03:55:28,290
I'm trying to think of what I need for the water fountain.

4071
03:55:28,290 --> 03:55:31,230
If anything...

4072
03:55:31,230 --> 03:55:33,590
I mean, obviously I do, but like...

4073
03:55:33,590 --> 03:55:37,290
I think the last couple of things I had were like the pizza box.

4074
03:55:38,050 --> 03:55:39,150
And the corn.

4075
03:55:41,170 --> 03:55:43,170
Not quite sure what to do with that.

4076
03:55:49,070 --> 03:55:50,930
Flower gem goes in the church, yes.

4077
03:55:51,050 --> 03:55:54,730
And then I imagine it will probably allow me to place the idols.

4078
03:56:02,510 --> 03:56:02,990
96.

4079
03:56:05,710 --> 03:56:06,630
Almost there.

4080
03:56:12,370 --> 03:56:12,850
97.

4081
03:56:21,350 --> 03:56:21,830
97.

4082
03:56:22,590 --> 03:56:23,490
Wait, did I get over here?

4083
03:56:24,110 --> 03:56:24,390
Yeah.

4084
03:56:25,350 --> 03:56:27,630
Oh wait, I didn't go to this side over here.

4085
03:56:31,230 --> 03:56:31,910
There we go.

4086
03:56:34,550 --> 03:56:35,550
There we go.

4087
03:56:40,430 --> 03:56:40,970
100.

4088
03:56:44,690 --> 03:56:48,510
We got 2 money.

4089
03:56:49,330 --> 03:56:50,210
We're at 5 money.

4090
03:56:51,850 --> 03:56:55,750
Maybe we'll get a big bonus if we save the entire world.

4091
03:56:56,130 --> 03:56:59,670
You know, if we save our boss from...

4092
03:56:59,670 --> 03:57:00,230
dying.

4093
03:57:01,130 --> 03:57:01,990
Let's go into the church.

4094
03:57:03,150 --> 03:57:04,470
And then we'll go into the maze.

4095
03:57:12,870 --> 03:57:14,490
This person is a ghost.

4096
03:57:25,070 --> 03:57:26,370
Want help on the maze?

4097
03:57:27,110 --> 03:57:27,590
Sure.

4098
03:57:28,790 --> 03:57:29,570
You can give me a hint.

4099
03:57:37,870 --> 03:57:38,650
Enjoy ghosts!

4100
03:57:38,730 --> 03:57:39,430
Thanks for the 20 gifts!

4101
03:57:42,410 --> 03:57:44,190
I think we found the crypt.

4102
03:57:45,650 --> 03:57:46,790
Is spear mint is green?

4103
03:57:46,930 --> 03:57:48,210
What flavor is purple mint?

4104
03:57:49,310 --> 03:57:50,010
Grape maybe?

4105
03:57:56,250 --> 03:58:00,890
I think the crypt is probably where we, like I said, where we put the idols, so...

4106
03:58:01,470 --> 03:58:02,730
Mervy, thanks for the 10 gifts!

4107
03:58:03,630 --> 03:58:04,370
Thank you.

4108
03:58:05,110 --> 03:58:05,910
Thank you both.

4109
03:58:12,180 --> 03:58:13,480
So let's go to the maze.

4110
03:58:17,480 --> 03:58:20,440
After you find the fountain guy, all you need is the hammer.

4111
03:58:20,820 --> 03:58:21,180
Oh really?

4112
03:58:22,280 --> 03:58:22,700
Okay.

4113
03:58:23,060 --> 03:58:25,600
I tried that though, because it said it's a delicate fountain.

4114
03:58:25,760 --> 03:58:26,980
Maybe I just...

4115
03:58:26,980 --> 03:58:28,080
Maybe I'm silly.

4116
03:58:29,480 --> 03:58:30,680
Confident feeling.

4117
03:58:32,120 --> 03:58:33,020
Yeah, I'm confident.

4118
03:58:33,400 --> 03:58:34,380
I don't need to look at anything.

4119
03:58:34,720 --> 03:58:35,400
I know where to go.

4120
03:58:35,700 --> 03:58:36,320
I go this way.

4121
03:58:36,640 --> 03:58:38,060
It's right around the corner!

4122
03:58:38,380 --> 03:58:39,100
It's right here!

4123
03:58:39,500 --> 03:58:40,520
It's right here!

4124
03:58:42,560 --> 03:58:44,720
It's right here!

4125
03:58:49,420 --> 03:58:51,380
It's a delicate looking fountain.

4126
03:58:51,380 --> 03:58:51,560
Fountain.

4127
03:58:56,260 --> 03:58:58,720
Getting my gallbladder removed tomorrow.

4128
03:58:58,880 --> 03:58:59,620
Wish me luck.

4129
03:59:07,100 --> 03:59:08,250
Obtained all idols.

4130
03:59:12,160 --> 03:59:14,550
Good luck, spicy cheese nips!

4131
03:59:15,330 --> 03:59:17,550
Why did you get your gallbladder removed for?

4132
03:59:23,670 --> 03:59:25,730
I had to kill a guy.

4133
03:59:27,090 --> 03:59:28,770
One last thing.

4134
03:59:30,130 --> 03:59:30,790
Listen.

4135
03:59:32,210 --> 03:59:33,470
You hear nothing.

4136
03:59:33,810 --> 03:59:35,030
Am I supposed to hear something?

4137
03:59:36,010 --> 03:59:38,090
I thought a coin would come out.

4138
03:59:41,170 --> 03:59:41,830
What?

4139
03:59:42,630 --> 03:59:43,670
What is that?

4140
03:59:44,910 --> 03:59:46,090
Was that the fire?

4141
03:59:46,630 --> 03:59:47,370
Did that guy die?

4142
03:59:53,930 --> 03:59:54,590
No.

4143
03:59:57,390 --> 03:59:57,950
Fisherman.

4144
04:00:03,360 --> 04:00:04,880
You gave the worm to the fisherman.

4145
04:00:17,740 --> 04:00:19,580
I think I killed the fisherman.

4146
04:00:21,480 --> 04:00:22,980
Oh my god.

4147
04:00:28,550 --> 04:00:29,630
Should we go?

4148
04:00:30,410 --> 04:00:32,010
But we just got all the idols.

4149
04:00:34,330 --> 04:00:35,370
Gallstones.

4150
04:00:35,510 --> 04:00:37,310
Oh no, I'm so sorry.

4151
04:00:38,910 --> 04:00:40,050
Kaguya, happy birthday!

4152
04:00:49,130 --> 04:00:51,950
Happy birthday to you!

4153
04:00:52,390 --> 04:00:54,210
Happy birthday to you!

4154
04:00:54,670 --> 04:00:56,890
Happy birthday dear Kaguya!

4155
04:00:57,710 --> 04:01:00,270
Happy birthday to you!

4156
04:01:04,110 --> 04:01:04,990
Happy birthday!

4157
04:01:05,650 --> 04:01:06,830
We need save slots.

4158
04:01:06,910 --> 04:01:09,070
I know, my gosh.

4159
04:01:10,870 --> 04:01:14,550
I want to go, but I feel like I will die.

4160
04:01:14,910 --> 04:01:16,450
And I just got all the idols.

4161
04:01:22,190 --> 04:01:23,410
What do you guys think?

4162
04:01:25,090 --> 04:01:26,130
A worm spirit.

4163
04:01:26,490 --> 04:01:27,730
Yeah, let's try it.

4164
04:01:28,410 --> 04:01:29,350
Oh my goodness.

4165
04:01:29,570 --> 04:01:30,170
Oh my goodness.

4166
04:01:31,250 --> 04:01:32,790
Guys, shield your eyes maybe.

4167
04:01:35,790 --> 04:01:36,550
Inspect.

4168
04:01:38,650 --> 04:01:40,570
The water looks extremely clear.

4169
04:01:45,450 --> 04:01:47,110
Nah, I tainted it.

4170
04:01:59,060 --> 04:02:01,860
Oh god.

4171
04:02:08,600 --> 04:02:09,140
I don't...

4172
04:02:10,560 --> 04:02:11,960
I don't know at all.

4173
04:02:23,390 --> 04:02:26,170
I think I'm gonna go to the idols.

4174
04:02:26,170 --> 04:02:26,350
Idols.

4175
04:02:41,570 --> 04:02:43,070
Motion sickness island.

4176
04:02:43,270 --> 04:02:43,970
For real though.

4177
04:02:46,010 --> 04:02:47,450
Does the M stand for mint?

4178
04:02:49,350 --> 04:02:51,350
Do I make you feel sick?

4179
04:02:52,970 --> 04:02:54,690
Do I make you feel like that?

4180
04:02:57,510 --> 04:02:58,470
Lampy!

4181
04:02:58,690 --> 04:02:59,650
Thanks for the gifted.

4182
04:03:00,350 --> 04:03:01,110
Thank you.

4183
04:03:03,790 --> 04:03:04,750
Yes!

4184
04:03:05,310 --> 04:03:06,130
Oh gosh, guys.

4185
04:03:11,910 --> 04:03:13,370
Shy idol.

4186
04:03:14,170 --> 04:03:15,130
Short idol.

4187
04:03:15,950 --> 04:03:17,030
Tall idol.

4188
04:03:17,850 --> 04:03:18,770
Gnome idol.

4189
04:03:19,330 --> 04:03:20,690
Return all idols to the church!

4190
04:03:23,910 --> 04:03:24,390
Guys?

4191
04:03:26,690 --> 04:03:27,210
Guys?

4192
04:03:29,210 --> 04:03:31,070
This is a little spooky now.

4193
04:03:41,210 --> 04:03:41,730
Hello?

4194
04:03:46,530 --> 04:03:47,770
What just happened?

4195
04:03:49,790 --> 04:03:49,990
What?

4196
04:03:50,130 --> 04:03:50,290
What?

4197
04:03:50,550 --> 04:03:51,210
What just happened?

4198
04:03:53,330 --> 04:03:55,410
Something is on... Something is on fire!

4199
04:03:55,550 --> 04:03:56,670
The whole city is on fire!

4200
04:03:57,850 --> 04:03:58,890
I got this.

4201
04:04:00,850 --> 04:04:02,110
Ok, I don't got this.

4202
04:04:03,110 --> 04:04:06,010
I think it's a little outside of my... my bucket.

4203
04:04:09,980 --> 04:04:11,560
I might have to jump in there?

4204
04:04:12,060 --> 04:04:13,140
Wait, this door is open.

4205
04:04:17,980 --> 04:04:18,280
Oh.

4206
04:04:19,040 --> 04:04:20,000
Well, what's the point?

4207
04:04:21,560 --> 04:04:21,840
Ok.

4208
04:04:26,120 --> 04:04:27,560
In here maybe?

4209
04:04:30,240 --> 04:04:31,560
The doors are open!

4210
04:04:33,940 --> 04:04:35,060
Oh boy!

4211
04:04:35,060 --> 04:04:36,660
The world explosive!

4212
04:04:36,980 --> 04:04:37,920
What do you mean?

4213
04:04:39,020 --> 04:04:39,820
Oh, hello?

4214
04:04:42,300 --> 04:04:42,580
What?

4215
04:04:42,700 --> 04:04:43,180
Who are you?

4216
04:04:43,200 --> 04:04:43,700
A gardener?

4217
04:04:44,780 --> 04:04:45,520
What are you doing here?

4218
04:04:46,140 --> 04:04:47,600
You returned the idols to the church?

4219
04:04:47,920 --> 04:04:48,240
Why?

4220
04:04:48,880 --> 04:04:50,260
It must have tricked you somehow.

4221
04:04:50,720 --> 04:04:54,960
These magical artifacts, the idols, together they opened a gateway to this realm...

4222
04:04:54,960 --> 04:04:55,260
No!

4223
04:04:55,400 --> 04:04:56,100
Metal gear!

4224
04:04:57,920 --> 04:04:59,180
The PAL keys!

4225
04:04:59,180 --> 04:04:59,560
The PAL keys!

4226
04:05:07,550 --> 04:05:09,970
It will break out and destroy our world!

4227
04:05:10,390 --> 04:05:12,190
I can already hear it just outside the house.

4228
04:05:12,510 --> 04:05:13,590
You must put an end to it.

4229
04:05:13,770 --> 04:05:15,030
There is only one way to stop this.

4230
04:05:15,270 --> 04:05:16,810
Quickly, take my key to the attic.

4231
04:05:17,250 --> 04:05:19,910
My blessed sword should be boxed up there.

4232
04:05:20,190 --> 04:05:22,370
I am unable to move as my soul is taken from me.

4233
04:05:22,830 --> 04:05:24,290
So you will have to do this alone.

4234
04:05:24,770 --> 04:05:26,890
Strike the demon with my holy blade!

4235
04:05:27,350 --> 04:05:28,870
Go now before it's too late!

4236
04:05:33,330 --> 04:05:34,150
OK, it doesn't work.

4237
04:05:36,450 --> 04:05:38,090
The music is kind of awesome though.

4238
04:05:38,590 --> 04:05:39,750
Can I still make that popcorn?

4239
04:05:40,090 --> 04:05:40,470
OK, no.

4240
04:05:41,490 --> 04:05:41,910
Oh, here.

4241
04:05:46,590 --> 04:05:47,670
What is this way though?

4242
04:05:48,870 --> 04:05:52,170
Maybe let's check this last door that looks like an attic room.

4243
04:05:52,470 --> 04:05:53,770
OK, the blade!

4244
04:05:54,730 --> 04:05:55,450
What is that?

4245
04:05:55,630 --> 04:05:56,330
Full of mushrooms!

4246
04:05:57,110 --> 04:05:57,590
Nothing?

4247
04:05:58,310 --> 04:05:58,610
Nothing?

4248
04:05:59,210 --> 04:06:00,610
Full of balls!

4249
04:06:01,550 --> 04:06:02,250
What is this?

4250
04:06:02,450 --> 04:06:03,330
Full of clothing!

4251
04:06:04,270 --> 04:06:05,750
We got the blessed sword!

4252
04:06:06,250 --> 04:06:06,350
OK.

4253
04:06:07,310 --> 04:06:08,130
Full of bounds!

4254
04:06:08,590 --> 04:06:09,330
Full of...

4255
04:06:10,390 --> 04:06:11,030
Snacks!

4256
04:06:12,290 --> 04:06:13,710
Full of chickens!

4257
04:06:15,990 --> 04:06:17,330
Save the KFP!

4258
04:06:18,110 --> 04:06:18,890
What is through here?

4259
04:06:19,770 --> 04:06:21,470
Oh, I don't think we want to go in there.

4260
04:06:29,350 --> 04:06:31,930
The purified stone protects you!

4261
04:06:47,230 --> 04:06:48,750
We are back in our world!

4262
04:06:49,590 --> 04:06:51,110
You actually did it!

4263
04:06:51,430 --> 04:06:53,530
Although my soul is still in that other place.

4264
04:06:54,270 --> 04:06:55,850
It makes me feel as if I am not really here.

4265
04:06:56,430 --> 04:06:57,990
But at least you are still alive.

4266
04:06:59,210 --> 04:07:01,030
You can forget about the gardening work.

4267
04:07:01,350 --> 04:07:02,750
It's not that important to me anyway.

4268
04:07:03,390 --> 04:07:04,750
Thanks for getting my body back here.

4269
04:07:05,290 --> 04:07:06,210
You are free to go now.

4270
04:07:06,850 --> 04:07:08,890
Just leap through the front gate whenever you like.

4271
04:07:09,830 --> 04:07:11,050
Are you going to pay me?

4272
04:07:13,990 --> 04:07:16,310
I mean, if you are dead, why can't I have your house?

4273
04:07:20,120 --> 04:07:21,860
I still can't afford the bus.

4274
04:07:30,120 --> 04:07:32,840
I'm just a broke gardener.

4275
04:07:33,380 --> 04:07:34,140
Oh wait!

4276
04:07:36,160 --> 04:07:37,040
A key?

4277
04:07:39,440 --> 04:07:41,040
What do you mean the key?

4278
04:07:42,860 --> 04:07:44,940
All the mysterious stuff is gone.

4279
04:07:45,460 --> 04:07:46,920
All the mysterious doorway...

4280
04:07:46,920 --> 04:07:48,060
Well, except this one I guess.

4281
04:07:50,980 --> 04:07:52,560
Still have this.

4282
04:07:54,200 --> 04:07:56,920
Give him a low score on glass door.

4283
04:07:58,720 --> 04:07:59,920
Where is the key?

4284
04:08:04,830 --> 04:08:06,690
Maybe I go out this way instead.

4285
04:08:11,770 --> 04:08:13,410
Reach the good ending!

4286
04:08:14,210 --> 04:08:16,950
You brought back the owner of the house.

4287
04:08:16,950 --> 04:08:18,830
6 out of 11 endings found.

4288
04:08:21,730 --> 04:08:24,470
And we got a cool sword for it too.

4289
04:08:31,460 --> 04:08:33,380
Good ending question mark.

4290
04:08:37,440 --> 04:08:44,380
I wonder if the good ending is also freeing him, you know?

4291
04:08:49,060 --> 04:08:50,500
Winner winner chicken dinner.

4292
04:08:52,280 --> 04:08:53,880
How many endings were there?

4293
04:08:56,340 --> 04:08:58,340
Oh, it was ending 11, wasn't it?

4294
04:08:58,500 --> 04:08:58,800
Or no.

4295
04:08:59,460 --> 04:09:01,600
It was ending 11.

4296
04:09:05,110 --> 04:09:07,270
We didn't even solve all the Polaroids.

4297
04:09:07,950 --> 04:09:10,050
We didn't even collect all the Polaroids.

4298
04:09:10,350 --> 04:09:12,030
We didn't even visit all the areas.

4299
04:09:12,710 --> 04:09:14,310
We didn't discover all the items.

4300
04:09:15,010 --> 04:09:16,250
We met all the characters though.

4301
04:09:18,470 --> 04:09:18,970
Wow.

4302
04:09:18,970 --> 04:09:25,590
It was ending 11, but it was the 6th ending that I found out of 11 endings.

4303
04:09:27,250 --> 04:09:29,490
You think the true ending is after 11-11?

4304
04:09:29,710 --> 04:09:31,810
You think it's like 12 out of 11?

4305
04:09:33,410 --> 04:09:34,770
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

4306
04:09:38,870 --> 04:09:40,350
Surprisingly big game.

4307
04:09:40,550 --> 04:09:45,890
A lot going on in this little game.

4308
04:09:45,990 --> 04:09:46,570
Groon.

4309
04:09:46,570 --> 04:09:47,670
Really unique game.

4310
04:09:47,730 --> 04:09:50,110
The looping reminds me of Outer Wilds, but it does its own thing.

4311
04:09:50,230 --> 04:09:50,990
Great job tonight, Minto.

4312
04:09:51,130 --> 04:09:51,830
Thank you!

4313
04:09:54,110 --> 04:09:56,390
I think one ending paid 10 coin bus...

4314
04:09:56,390 --> 04:09:59,750
10 coin for the bus to escape from the mist?

4315
04:09:59,850 --> 04:10:00,630
Probably that.

4316
04:10:01,730 --> 04:10:09,090
Probably like the drowning in that one room where you get to travel.

4317
04:10:09,890 --> 04:10:11,070
What else can you die?

4318
04:10:14,390 --> 04:10:15,550
The world explode?

4319
04:10:15,650 --> 04:10:16,830
Yeah, that's probably a bad ending.

4320
04:10:20,670 --> 04:10:23,690
I didn't go into that one room that was like all dark and red.

4321
04:10:23,910 --> 04:10:26,950
I'm wondering, I wonder, maybe his body was in there.

4322
04:10:29,650 --> 04:10:30,750
Oh, the dog?

4323
04:10:30,850 --> 04:10:32,670
Yeah, maybe dying by the dog.

4324
04:10:32,890 --> 04:10:34,930
Because he's angry before you give him the bone.

4325
04:10:46,250 --> 04:10:47,330
The holy water?

4326
04:10:48,190 --> 04:10:50,070
Oh yeah, we don't even know what that was.

4327
04:10:50,130 --> 04:10:52,130
The water in that island that we discovered.

4328
04:10:52,710 --> 04:10:53,730
Yeah, M Island.

4329
04:10:54,750 --> 04:10:55,650
I have no idea.

4330
04:10:57,770 --> 04:10:58,730
So mysterious.

4331
04:10:59,390 --> 04:11:01,130
That one, I...

4332
04:11:01,130 --> 04:11:03,270
I can't even begin to think about.

4333
04:11:06,410 --> 04:11:07,830
So many mysteries.

4334
04:11:07,990 --> 04:11:10,090
I know, what a fascinating little game.

4335
04:11:11,310 --> 04:11:12,310
That was so much fun.

4336
04:11:12,350 --> 04:11:13,410
I hope you guys liked it.

4337
04:11:13,410 --> 04:11:19,290
I thought it was like a good kind of like spooky not spooky kind of game to do.

4338
04:11:20,130 --> 04:11:22,310
Good gardening Minto, never trust a gnome.

4339
04:11:22,870 --> 04:11:23,590
So true.

4340
04:11:24,830 --> 04:11:26,110
Yeah, it was pretty neat.

4341
04:11:28,510 --> 04:11:30,290
Thank you guys for the stream.

4342
04:11:31,850 --> 04:11:33,150
I'm gonna head out now.

4343
04:11:33,370 --> 04:11:35,030
I'm gonna go talk with Matara, I guess.

4344
04:11:38,050 --> 04:11:41,350
Yeah, I'm gonna head out.

4345
04:11:41,350 --> 04:11:44,350
And if you wanna play...

4346
04:11:44,350 --> 04:11:48,690
If you play this game and figure out what M Island is for, please let me know.

4347
04:11:49,070 --> 04:11:50,070
I'm so curious.

4348
04:11:50,890 --> 04:11:51,750
So so curious.

4349
04:11:52,370 --> 04:11:54,550
And I didn't get all the endings, so...

4350
04:11:54,910 --> 04:12:02,350
If you're wanting to see the other areas that we missed and the other endings and the other items that we missed, all that...

4351
04:12:03,110 --> 04:12:04,050
Yeah, go for it.

4352
04:12:04,730 --> 04:12:05,390
Let me know.

4353
04:12:06,950 --> 04:12:08,670
Especially the M Island, I'm so curious.

4354
04:12:09,550 --> 04:12:10,250
Matara ending.

4355
04:12:10,430 --> 04:12:10,710
No!

4356
04:12:13,570 --> 04:12:14,690
Chai Princess, thank you!

4357
04:12:16,010 --> 04:12:16,930
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4358
04:12:18,730 --> 04:12:22,770
I like how Eurojuggler at the very beginning of the stream was like, beware the mulch.

4359
04:12:22,850 --> 04:12:24,090
And I was like, oh, okay.

4360
04:12:24,550 --> 04:12:25,170
There's gonna be something.

4361
04:12:25,270 --> 04:12:27,330
You've played this game, there's gonna be something about the mulch.

4362
04:12:27,930 --> 04:12:28,710
And then there never was.

4363
04:12:30,850 --> 04:12:32,630
Matara Island, cause she makes you sick.

4364
04:12:34,830 --> 04:12:36,750
Anyways, I hope you guys liked it.

4365
04:12:36,750 --> 04:12:38,030
I had a lot of fun.

4366
04:12:38,110 --> 04:12:39,890
I will see you guys tomorrow.

4367
04:12:40,050 --> 04:12:40,510
I'm not streaming.

4368
04:12:41,870 --> 04:12:43,850
Thursday I'm actually doing a collab with Matara.

4369
04:12:44,550 --> 04:12:46,530
We're playing the new Mario game.

4370
04:12:46,610 --> 04:12:47,650
It comes out on Thursday.

4371
04:12:48,010 --> 04:12:50,330
The new Mario Party game, and we will be playing it.

4372
04:12:50,370 --> 04:12:53,410
Mario Party Jamboree.

4373
04:12:55,410 --> 04:12:57,590
So yeah, I will be streaming my POV.

4374
04:12:59,570 --> 04:13:01,870
So yeah, I will see you then if I see you.

4375
04:13:02,070 --> 04:13:05,670
And if not, I'll see you whenever.

4376
04:13:08,050 --> 04:13:08,550
Yippee!

4377
04:13:08,790 --> 04:13:09,290
Yippee!

4378
04:13:09,870 --> 04:13:10,950
Thank you guys!

4379
04:13:11,190 --> 04:13:11,690
Otsumito!

4380
04:13:12,230 --> 04:13:12,690
Otsumito!

4381
04:13:12,810 --> 04:13:13,190
Otsumito!

4382
04:13:13,950 --> 04:13:14,450
Itterasshai!

4383
04:13:14,590 --> 04:13:15,970
I'll see you guys later!

4384
04:13:17,310 --> 04:13:18,890
Oh, I also wanted to mention.

4385
04:13:20,850 --> 04:13:22,110
The stream on Saturday.

4386
04:13:24,030 --> 04:13:26,370
I actually didn't plan on streaming that day.

4387
04:13:26,650 --> 04:13:28,050
Because I'm going to go see my grandma.

4388
04:13:31,290 --> 04:13:34,590
So, the stream on Saturday will be very, very short.

4389
04:13:34,590 --> 04:13:35,510
I apologize.

4390
04:13:35,990 --> 04:13:37,650
It's just the debut watch-along.

4391
04:13:38,050 --> 04:13:39,590
Yeah, the idol EN watch-along.

4392
04:13:41,670 --> 04:13:43,510
So, sorry if you're just like, what?

4393
04:13:43,550 --> 04:13:45,210
She's only streaming for like an hour?

4394
04:13:47,230 --> 04:13:47,710
Yeah.

4395
04:13:48,750 --> 04:13:50,850
I wasn't supposed to stream that day actually.

4396
04:13:51,330 --> 04:13:52,630
Since I'm going to go see my grandma.

4397
04:13:53,370 --> 04:13:54,970
I'll tell you guys how she's doing.

4398
04:13:55,570 --> 04:13:56,050
Yeah.

4399
04:13:56,570 --> 04:13:56,890
Okay!

4400
04:13:57,890 --> 04:13:58,850
Bye bye!

4401
04:13:59,910 --> 04:14:00,390
Itterasshai!

4402
04:14:00,870 --> 04:14:01,570
Bye bye!

4403
04:14:01,690 --> 04:14:01,910
Wait.

4404
04:14:02,410 --> 04:14:03,630
Before I go...

4405
04:14:05,350 --> 04:14:06,610
I want to be...

4406
04:14:06,610 --> 04:14:08,130
I want to...

4407
04:14:08,130 --> 04:14:09,610
I want to be myself!

4408
04:14:10,230 --> 04:14:11,930
Before you go...

4409
04:14:11,930 --> 04:14:13,770
I want to be myself!

4410
04:14:15,470 --> 04:14:16,230
Eww!

4411
04:14:30,380 --> 04:14:31,140
Okay.

4412
04:14:33,480 --> 04:14:34,240
Okay.

4413
04:14:36,140 --> 04:14:37,240
Bye bye.

4414
04:14:38,780 --> 04:14:40,600
