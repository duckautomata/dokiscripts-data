00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,860
Hello.

2
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,880
Car.

3
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,760
Hello.

4
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:13,750
I thought I was okay yesterday.

5
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,750
Then I went out last night.

6
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,290
I had like worked all day.

7
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:27,090
Then I went out last night and I went to a restaurant and I got potatoes.

8
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,130
And my stomach was like, no.

9
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,970
I was like, no!

10
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,790
All I did was eat potatoes.

11
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,690
Okay, wait, and corn soup.

12
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,470
And then I woke up.

13
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,370
I was like, oh gosh, my tummy is still not feeling so good.

14
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:46,850
And...

15
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,370
I drank tomato, no, sorry, veggie juice.

16
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,670
It's more than tomatoes.

17
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,530
It's a veggie juice.

18
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:56,630
And...

19
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,050
My tummy was just like, oh, are you dying?

20
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,730
Oh, gosh.

21
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,010
The feeling after a food coma, I wish it was that.

22
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,230
I wish it was a food coma.

23
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,210
Guys, I have a food poisoning.

24
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,210
I've had it for a couple of days.

25
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,950
But I thought yesterday I was okay.

26
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:21,610
I was like, all right.

27
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,090
I've had nothing.

28
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,330
I was like, I've gone the whole day.

29
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,170
I'm feeling mostly okay.

30
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,210
Man.

31
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,010
Yogurt can help?

32
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:32,570
Wait, really?

33
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,150
Wait, can it actually?

34
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,870
The cursed Japan trip.

35
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,710
This trip, I've gotten sick so many times.

36
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,610
I think I need to go to the boo-spital when I go home.

37
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,670
Because I'm like, I need a checkup.

38
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,290
I'm like, am I okay?

39
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,870
Why do I keep getting sick?

40
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,350
Why do I keep getting sick?

41
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:00,870
The boo-spital?

42
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,750
Yeah, it's the hospital but for ghosts.

43
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,430
You know?

44
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,110
You know?

45
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,910
Good bacteria for the stomach.

46
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:10,770
Probiotics.

47
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,990
I wonder if I could go get like a Yakult.

48
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,150
Okay.

49
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,610
My poison was too weak.

50
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,470
The ghost-spital?

51
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:22,930
No, no.

52
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,550
The boo-spital.

53
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,920
Please understand.

54
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,460
I don't make the rules.

55
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,500
I don't make the rules.

56
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,760
You can get gummy probiotics.

57
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,020
Also, I thought maybe I was just like...

58
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,640
I was like, oh my gosh.

59
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,300
Oh, thanks really.

60
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,380
Sorry you've been sick.

61
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,400
Sending you some extra energy.

62
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,020
Thank you.

63
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,160
Yeah.

64
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
I thought also I was just like...

65
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,340
When the night that I got the food poisoning, I was just...

66
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,600
I had McDonalds which is like just the most pathetic thing I think ever in the world.

67
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,440
To get food poisoning from McDonalds.

68
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,580
But I also took like an iron gummy supplement.

69
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,520
And it's like supposed to be a super strong supplement.

70
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,780
So I was like, oh, okay.

71
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,800
Cool.

72
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,520
Maybe...

73
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,980
I was like, I don't know if it's a McDonalds or if it's...

74
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,840
My...

75
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,400
My... my... my spirit is just rejecting the iron.

76
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,700
Your system disagreeing with the amount of grease?

77
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,060
I don't eat so much, so it's like...

78
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,060
Yeah...

79
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,260
But sorry.

80
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,320
Sorry to be complaining.

81
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,060
I don't mean to complain this whole time.

82
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,960
I don't mean to complain this whole time.

83
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,880
But it is going to be a shorter stream.

84
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,760
Just to guys give you some context.

85
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,740
This is why...

86
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,280
It's a shorter stream.

87
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,720
Just to give some context, you know?

88
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,700
But yeah!

89
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,780
Welcome everybody to this game called Love Ghosty!

90
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,660
I thought it was pretty cute.

91
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,420
I was like, this is... I mean, it's about a ghost.

92
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,400
And then that's me.

93
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:07,940
So...

94
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,540
Listen to the music, it's so cute.

95
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,580
I remember seeing the trailers for this a while ago.

96
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,140
Didn't think I'd be awake for this.

97
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,780
Good morning!

98
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,740
Top right is my oshi.

99
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,120
Sorry.

100
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,520
I went out last night, like I said.

101
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,640
I did some karaoke thinking that I was okay.

102
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,000
Until I got there and I was like, I'm not okay.

103
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,760
But...

104
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,440
I screamed a little bit.

105
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,960
Now my voice is kind of...

106
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,980
Kind of gone.

107
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,620
Kind of look like Animal Crossing characters.

108
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,660
Yeah, a little bit.

109
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,020
But...

110
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,600
Yeah, you like go around and you like match these characters.

111
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,900
Look at them.

112
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,580
Oh, I'm blocking them.

113
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,700
It looks like the polar bears fallen in love with me.

114
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,620
Actually, the spotlight is on me.

115
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,560
Oh my gosh, I'm not the matchmaker.

116
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,480
I'm the matchee.

117
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,980
Oh my gosh.

118
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,320
Polar bear.

119
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,180
I didn't even go to the Arctic.

120
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,320
I went to the Antarctic.

121
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,240
Which many people actually confused where you are from.

122
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,340
But I know the real truth.

123
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,020
I know.

124
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,820
I know.

125
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,400
From Zanzibar land.

126
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,400
I'm going to Alaska, baby.

127
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,480
But yeah, so I just want to play it.

128
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,680
I was listening to a certain Ikenai...

129
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,140
Oh, Ikenai.

130
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,760
I almost read Ikenai borderline.

131
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,520
A certain Ikenai that cover.

132
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,800
I was crying and being nostalgic.

133
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,240
Reminded me how much I love your spirit.

134
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,260
Get it?

135
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:10,880
Because it goes.

136
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,470
Spirit?

137
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,790
Spirit.

138
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:23,210
Spirit.

139
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:28,650
Haruka!

140
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,250
Thanks for the gift card.

141
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,350
Oh yeah, let's play game.

142
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,210
Let's play game.

143
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:37,990
Let's play game.

144
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,490
Hold on.

145
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,650
I make stuff on my computer.

146
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:45,330
Oh, I was going to say press space but we can just play.

147
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,950
If I have to move around too because...

148
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,430
Oh, see.

149
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,190
I was going to say, hello.

150
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,370
I don't know what to say because of any dialogue or whatever.

151
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,090
Psst!

152
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,330
Hey!

153
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,290
Are you awake?

154
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,110
Oh my god!

155
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,790
Hahaha!

156
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,430
Just kidding!

157
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,070
You're dead!

158
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,690
Why are you going to call me out like that?

159
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,930
This is messed up!

160
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,570
Don't laugh at me being dead!

161
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,210
But the good news is you're a ghost!

162
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,030
Wait, hold on.

163
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,420
There we go.

164
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,520
I died?

165
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,220
Yeah, it's a lot to take in.

166
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,300
I'll give you some time to process it.

167
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,380
Okay, time over.

168
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,160
Okay, now that we're over it, let me introduce myself.

169
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,660
I'm Ghostina.

170
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,470
Oh my gosh, just because we're dead doesn't mean our ghost names have to be so...

171
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,970
ghost-related.

172
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,330
Like, I know I know a ghost of her, but like...

173
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,210
That's different, okay?

174
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,510
I'm Ghostina, and your mentor for the afterlife.

175
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,310
Guess what WE do in the afterlife.

176
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,030
Sentiment phantom.

177
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,330
What'd you say?

178
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,250
I can't hear you over me being a perfect ghost.

179
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,630
I can't...

180
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,530
I can't hear you over me being a perfect ghost.

181
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,270
I can't hear you over me being a perfect...

182
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:47,830
I can't hear you over me being a perfect...

183
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,470
real ghost.

184
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,800
Yeah, tell her.

185
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,060
Matchmaking!

186
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,080
We do matchmaking in the afterlife.

187
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,520
Contrary to popular belief, we don't just scare people.

188
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,860
Even though that can be pretty fun.

189
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,980
We love watching romances bloom...

190
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:30,480
Happy to report that I have paid off and received the first $500 worth of my OnlyPhantom commissions.

191
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,260
Only about $600 more to go!

192
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,440
Filling up the tag, aren't you?

193
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,980
Thank you.

194
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,640
Kinky my man.

195
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,220
Stop!

196
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,400
They didn't even... they wrote... they didn't even put their name.

197
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:25,860
They said me.

198
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,100
No doxxing.

199
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,760
We love watching romances bloom on the battlefield.

200
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,780
And making people happy.

201
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,340
Fun fact.

202
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,660
Did you know ghost-driven romances are 20 times more successful than dating apps?

203
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,060
You guys!

204
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,600
These are the real stats.

205
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,080
These are the real stats.

206
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,980
These are the real stats, okay?

207
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,540
Oh my gosh, sorry.

208
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,460
I'm watching this guy on TV.

209
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,580
He has a cowboy hat on.

210
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,340
And a denim shirt on with an American flag.

211
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,500
And he is wearing an American flag ascot.

212
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,100
And he's giving makeovers to old Japanese ladies.

213
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:16,890
Howdy.

214
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,450
Okay, sorry.

215
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,790
We just don't get credit for it.

216
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:23,210
No!

217
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,250
Because we're done.

218
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,180
I died?

219
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,440
Still not over it, huh?

220
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:33,840
Anyway.

221
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,200
Welcome to the manor.

222
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:38,740
Whoa.

223
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,620
What's a wisps gotta do to get a ghostly matchmaking?

224
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:42,960
Hey.

225
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,780
Hey, hey, hey.

226
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,460
I'll get in line, first of all.

227
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,460
And also, I just...

228
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,100
When I feel like it.

229
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,860
Where is everybody?

230
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,620
Yeah, it's empty.

231
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,140
I turned them all into ghosts?

232
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,140
Ghostina.

233
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,700
Just kidding.

234
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,660
Oh my gosh.

235
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,380
I was gonna say, Ghostina.

236
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,800
You've been busy.

237
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,620
Anyways.

238
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,800
No one lives here.

239
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,540
Don't worry.

240
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,540
That'll change soon.

241
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,800
You better not pair me with a dragoon.

242
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,500
I mean.

243
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,700
It's already...

244
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,820
Anonymous wisp.

245
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,320
Minto.

246
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,240
It's up to you.

247
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,880
Up to you.

248
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,440
Link me up with my crew.

249
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,360
Who's also a wisp.

250
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,000
I believe in you.

251
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,640
This makes sense.

252
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,540
They do ship chat with themselves often.

253
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,800
I'm telling you.

254
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,440
What are you doing for a Scooby snack?

255
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,020
Raggy.

256
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,840
A Scooby snack?

257
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,220
Raggy.

258
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,460
I'll do anything for a Scooby snack.

259
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,700
What can it be a Minto snack?

260
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,320
What would a Minto snack be?

261
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:08,780
Oh.

262
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,340
Corn.

263
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,140
I put up a sign that says free rent in this definitely not haunted house.

264
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,960
Out in front.

265
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,940
Now before people move in.

266
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,980
Let's begin your training.

267
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,340
Okay.

268
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,680
So this is so opposite of me.

269
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,200
Because I do not want people moving into my maid cafe.

270
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:24,640
You know.

271
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,620
My training.

272
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,000
My training.

273
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,740
Corn soup chips.

274
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,260
Oh.

275
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:31,840
Yum.

276
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,580
Corn.

277
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,980
Do you guys remember that corn kid?

278
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,500
The key to offering good love advice is that first you must love yourself.

279
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,200
Think you're up to it.

280
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,200
Shut up, Murphy.

281
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,020
I don't want to hear that BS.

282
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,620
That's fake.

283
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,340
I don't want to hear it.

284
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,940
The corn kid.

285
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,360
Yeah.

286
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,020
The kid that was just like, I love corn.

287
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:56,920
Yeah.

288
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,400
Corn.

289
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,780
And he like went super viral.

290
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,460
And like.

291
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,820
Every time.

292
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,720
Everybody was just like, yeah.

293
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
This is corn kid.

294
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,000
I hope that kid's doing well.

295
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,780
People even made songs about him.

296
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,520
Big lump with knobs.

297
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:13,940
Yeah.

298
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,220
Yeah.

299
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,420
Yeah.

300
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:14,680
Yeah.

301
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah.

302
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,760
Yeah.

303
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,460
Yeah.

304
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:20,920
Yeah.

305
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,100
Yeah.

306
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,240
Yeah.

307
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,380
Yeah.

308
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,060
Yeah.

309
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,140
Yeah.

310
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:23,900
Yeah.

311
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,920
Yeah.

312
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,280
Oh.

313
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,480
I drew all of this myself.

314
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:30,920
Wow.

315
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,340
We're going to be honest.

316
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,480
Looks kind of shabby.

317
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,160
Well.

318
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,400
I'm not an artist.

319
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,340
I am a ghost.

320
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,660
Yeah.

321
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,000
Who went to art school.

322
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:44,440
Oh.

323
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,540
Mood.

324
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,460
Anyway.

325
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,360
Residents live their lives and have no idea you're here.

326
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
But you can still make a difference.

327
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:56,900
Yeah.

328
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,180
You can still make a difference.

329
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:58,980
First we need items.

330
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,820
Meet me in the attic.

331
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,100
Oh.

332
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:02,700
Okay.

333
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,180
Look at.

334
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,860
Oh my gosh.

335
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,440
When I move.

336
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:05,720
Oh.

337
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:05,880
Here.

338
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,660
I hear.

339
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,520
Let me move actually.

340
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,480
Um.

341
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,600
When I move.

342
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,340
There's like a little love trail.

343
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,720
I'm leaking.

344
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,140
Oh my gosh.

345
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,400
I'm leaking ectoplasm.

346
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,200
And it's pink.

347
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,280
It's kind of new.

348
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:22,780
Oh.

349
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,700
I can zoom in and out.

350
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,320
Okay.

351
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,420
I'm going to use watch to then.

352
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:26,900
Okay.

353
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,460
I'm going to go through the house.

354
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,580
Whoa.

355
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:30,620
Whoa.

356
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,680
Oh my gosh.

357
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,400
There's a bunch of fake people in this house.

358
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,180
Oh!

359
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:36,660
Oh.

360
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,960
Look at me.

361
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,380
I can go through walls and everything.

362
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,380
What's happening?

363
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,120
Ah!

364
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,110
What's happening?

365
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,210
Ah!

366
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,940
One second guys.

367
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,760
I'll try it.

368
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,360
I don't need.

369
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't see.

370
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,220
I don't know if there's more than.

371
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,620
What I see but.

372
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,060
See you later!

373
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,580
WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

374
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,860
Change the... I saw it...

375
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,940
Oh wait, let me do... let me change the permission.

376
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,820
Sorry guys.

377
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,360
Save.

378
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,240
Oh my gosh.

379
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,340
Yeah, okay.

380
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,080
There we go.

381
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,760
That was crazy.

382
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,380
That's never even happened to me before.

383
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,080
Oh my gosh.

384
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,640
I've never had bots like that before.

385
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,380
Get out of here, bots!

386
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,100
Skynet invasion.

387
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,940
If I have to change it... I'm even gonna change it to 10 minutes.

388
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,100
They'll get bored.

389
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,740
Go away, bots.

390
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,920
Just in case.

391
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,060
Oh my gosh.

392
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,140
Begun!

393
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,620
Begun!

394
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,080
Begun!

395
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,000
Minto's first bot attack.

396
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,100
Oh my gosh, you guys saw my first ever bot attack!

397
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,520
Come on!

398
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,020
Plus 5000 social credit.

399
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,180
What does that mean?

400
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,340
Okay, anyway.

401
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,900
We're a ghost.

402
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,220
That's right.

403
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,940
We're meeting a ghost in an attic.

404
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,800
Oh, there's like an apple there.

405
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,340
Okay.

406
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,680
I was here.

407
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:56,760
Speak.

408
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,940
You know how you mysteriously lose a sock in the laundry?

409
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,240
That was probably a ghost.

410
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,280
The quoting bots from the FNAF stream.

411
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,980
Wait, I don't remember those.

412
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,140
What quoting bots?

413
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,560
We like taking stuff.

414
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,660
When you see something you like, you can take it.

415
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,560
But it costs you an arbitrary ghost action point.

416
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,760
Don't ask why.

417
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,680
Why?

418
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:30,700
Listen.

419
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,460
Who's been a ghost longer?

420
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,880
Do you know how ghosts work?

421
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,960
I've been a ghost longer, for real.

422
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,140
Hey, first bot attack.

423
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,600
Congratulations.

424
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,260
Thank you!

425
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,600
I don't steal your socks.

426
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,260
That's nasty.

427
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,700
Stop stealing my socks, you stink.

428
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,080
I'm not stealing socks!

429
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,340
I don't care about your socks!

430
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,160
Where were you during the 2024 mental bot attack?

431
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:00,580
Listen.

432
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,860
Who's been a ghost longer?

433
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,460
Do you know how ghosts work?

434
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,460
We have action points.

435
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,280
It's a ghost thing.

436
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,320
Maybe when you were alive, you had to sleep.

437
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,160
But when you're a ghost, you have action points.

438
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,340
Anyway.

439
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,360
Try grabbing this apple on the ground now.

440
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,000
Apples shouldn't be on the ground anyway.

441
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,160
I'm stealing?

442
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,620
For an action point.

443
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,320
Okay.

444
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,060
I'm stealing.

445
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,340
Enjoy ghost.

446
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,340
Thanks for the 20 gifted.

447
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,100
Nice.

448
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,580
Now that we have an item, there are a couple of things we can do.

449
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,380
One option is to sell it on the ghost... the ghost internet.

450
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,180
Oh my gosh.

451
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,820
That place is scary.

452
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,720
I do not go there.

453
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,700
Say that computer over there.

454
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,840
From there, you can sell items for ghost money.

455
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,300
You guys remember when I tell you that the ghost world is just like the human world?

456
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,740
See?

457
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,200
It's so similar.

458
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,440
She doesn't steal socks.

459
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,640
She steals panties.

460
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,960
Stop guessing correctly.

461
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,400
From there, you can sell items for ghost money.

462
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,300
You can also buy nicer items that you can't find in the manor.

463
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,320
Feel free to take a look.

464
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,760
Whenever you're ready, pick a resident and go to their room for the next lesson.

465
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,340
I'll meet you there.

466
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,980
Oh my gosh.

467
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,320
Joy!

468
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,580
Thanks for the aqua super.

469
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,200
I'm so happy.

470
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,940
Hold to...

471
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,980
Oh, hold shift to sprint.

472
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:26,740
Oh my gosh.

473
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,220
Look at me go.

474
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,040
I'm interacting.

475
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,620
Oh my gosh.

476
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,820
Not dead it.

477
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
The ghostie forums.

478
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,640
Help!

479
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,340
I sold my apple during training.

480
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,320
I got an apple during training and I sold it by accident.

481
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:42,920
Help!

482
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,680
What do I do?

483
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,740
I don't want to get in trouble.

484
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,480
It's my first day.

485
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,180
It's okay.

486
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,520
Don't worry.

487
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,320
They have backups.

488
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,200
What?

489
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,140
I didn't know you could sell it.

490
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,540
I thought we were supposed to keep it.

491
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,180
You think they wouldn't account for it?

492
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,400
They're ghost selling their apple in training.

493
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,740
I sold mine.

494
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,120
I got money for it.

495
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,020
Help!

496
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,020
Thanks for the 20 gifted.

497
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,680
I'm going to sell my apple.

498
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,440
Yippee!

499
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,080
Wow.

500
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,040
It sold so fast.

501
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,520
And was I not supposed to sell it?

502
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,720
Send emails.

503
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,360
Earn money.

504
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,220
Oh my gosh.

505
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,640
Oh my gosh.

506
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:23,720
Oh my gosh.

507
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,440
Okay.

508
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,060
Four doubloons.

509
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,080
Okay.

510
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,720
Who do we want to go bother of these fake residents?

511
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,860
We have cat.

512
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,280
We have bunny.

513
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,380
Who is employee of the month?

514
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,240
Do I see so?

515
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,100
Hold on.

516
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,260
Yes.

517
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,580
Employee of the month.

518
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,140
What did he do?

519
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,220
We have this crow and a bear.

520
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,320
Cardboard car.

521
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,060
He's got a...

522
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,420
Yeah.

523
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,120
He's got...

524
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,300
He's got a...

525
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,020
A car bed.

526
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,140
Bot attack.

527
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:13,300
I hear it's amazing when the famous purple stuffed worm in Flapjaw's space with the dirty fork does the raw blink on Harakiri Rock.

528
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,640
I need scissors 61.

529
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,680
The cat is cute.

530
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,660
Okay.

531
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,500
I'm going to go with the cat.

532
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:23,860
Okay.

533
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:25,900
Okay.

534
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,980
Oh, you picked person.

535
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,420
It's not a person.

536
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:31,880
It's a cat.

537
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,800
Good choice.

538
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,520
Okay.

539
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,360
Now we just need that...

540
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,140
You sold the apple?

541
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,980
Well, I guess we'll have to continue with this.

542
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,940
It's a training apple I keep for emergencies.

543
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,300
I'm sure you know what else ghost can do with apples.

544
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:53,860
It's a cat.

545
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:01,000
Well, that's why you possess people and eat their food.

546
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,860
And then get food poisoning for it.

547
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,580
We still have butts!

548
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,440
But they're mostly for sitting.

549
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,780
Oh, I have a butt.

550
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,500
Anyways...

551
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,580
We can give things to residents.

552
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,260
Yeah!

553
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,290
But we just...

554
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:32,850
But we can't just say this gift was from a ghost in your house that you can't see but is actively watching you right now.

555
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,710
Trust me.

556
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,690
I did that.

557
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,010
Oh my gosh, speaking of butts, you guys, I heard something.

558
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,590
And I'm bestowing this knowledge to you.

559
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:47,690
I heard that millennials... I don't know if it was just millennials.

560
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,030
I think I heard it about millennials, though.

561
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,810
But that millennials are not getting enough fiber.

562
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:59,650
And I think probably, I'm like, oh my gosh.

563
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,310
Food poisoning.

564
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,230
I'm making this food poisoning thing my whole personality.

565
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,690
But they're not getting enough fiber.

566
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:10,870
And...

567
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,830
But I've heard actually...

568
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:19,470
I heard actually that like people are getting colon cancer because they're not getting enough fiber.

569
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,050
Which if that's true, that's crazy.

570
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,630
And you guys need to have fiber.

571
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:27,890
Eat...

572
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:29,550
prunes?

573
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:34,730
Raisins.

574
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,870
Eat raisins and prunes.

575
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:38,270
Everybody.

576
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,110
My veggie drink that I'm drinking right now has lots of fiber.

577
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,630
Fiber wipe off.

578
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,170
So true.

579
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,710
So eat your fiber everybody, okay?

580
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,910
Eat your fiber.

581
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,870
Eat your fiber and make sure that your butt is healthy.

582
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,050
Fiber glass.

583
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,370
I think, okay.

584
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,890
Just a suggestion.

585
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,370
Remove the glass part.

586
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,350
I think you're good.

587
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,750
It's just a suggestion though.

588
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,390
Yeah.

589
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,050
Everybody eat your fiber.

590
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,010
Okay.

591
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,190
Worst 30 years ever.

592
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,070
I really thought I'd win them over.

593
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,490
So when you leave a gift, say it's from someone else in the house.

594
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,630
Stay safe.

595
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,750
Keep pooping.

596
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,190
So true.

597
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,370
Gifting requires action points.

598
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,230
My life changed ever since I got more fiber.

599
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,430
Wifi is a thing of the past.

600
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:48,650
Yeah.

601
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,750
Fiber internet.

602
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,590
Fiber intake.

603
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,310
Fiber wipe off.

604
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,430
You need all kinds of fiber.

605
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,250
Except the glass.

606
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:03,350
You'll be able to make pairs of residents closer with your gifts.

607
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,070
Okay.

608
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:08,330
Try gifting the apple in this spot and pick which resident you want to gift it from.

609
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:09,990
Okay.

610
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,630
I'm gifting my...

611
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,670
Wait.

612
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,430
This is worth six coins.

613
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,170
Oh, dang it.

614
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,290
I can't leave.

615
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,230
I was going to go sell it.

616
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,230
It's from Burbson Burbson.

617
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,370
Burbson or Bunson?

618
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,730
Oh, it's from Bunson.

619
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:33,470
Gift.

620
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,930
Aww, they're a cute couple.

621
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:37,610
Look at you.

622
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,290
I guess you're a supernatural.

623
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:51,590
They're not getting colon cancer because of a lack of fiber, but because they can't stop shoving things into places they're not supposed to.

624
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:55,870
Thanks, Dr. ButtsMD.

625
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,620
Thanks, Dr. ButtsMD.

626
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,380
I've been waiting on that joke.

627
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,060
I've been dying to tell you the whole time.

628
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,580
I remember.

629
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,920
Residents all have different things they like.

630
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,220
The better the gift, the better the effect on their relationships.

631
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,240
Alright.

632
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,880
Looks like you have two actions left for the day.

633
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,820
Let me show you what else you can do.

634
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:21,780
Okay.

635
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,340
The chore board.

636
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,960
Oh my gosh.

637
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:31,640
Thankfully, every resident who ends up living here agrees to work together to make this house better.

638
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,140
They put up this...

639
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,980
So it's not me that has to do stuff.

640
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,980
They put up this handy chore board here.

641
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,460
Actually, I put it up.

642
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,180
But it's not like I can tell them that.

643
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,980
Why would you make them do chores?

644
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,720
Do you want to do them instead?

645
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,540
Besides, it's good for them.

646
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,180
You'll see.

647
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,720
From here you can assign residents to chores to do at the end of the day.

648
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:55,940
Oh.

649
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,420
Let's try it out.

650
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,160
Every day there are three types of chores.

651
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,140
Dates?

652
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,620
I love that dates are a chore.

653
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,100
This is so real.

654
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,540
That's ghost thinking.

655
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,480
So true.

656
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,880
Less cupid and more manager.

657
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,700
No.

658
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,220
Dates, self care, and house helper.

659
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,140
I think only one of those should be a chore.

660
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,900
Each of these costs ghost action points.

661
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,420
So only assign the ones you want.

662
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,780
Plus some residents will like certain chores more than others.

663
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,340
Introvert stuff.

664
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,320
Dates are a chore.

665
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:42,920
It's true though.

666
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,160
Dates are a chore.

667
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:44,760
I believe.

668
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,820
Select a slot on a chore to learn more about it and assign a resident.

669
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,020
Go to the beach.

670
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:52,900
Outdoorsy.

671
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,240
Bright.

672
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,260
Listen to music.

673
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,040
That's my favorite.

674
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,520
Oh gosh.

675
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,720
I have to listen to music.

676
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,580
Let's do it.

677
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,220
I like person.

678
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:10,820
Musical.

679
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,720
Classic.

680
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,200
Nice.

681
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,280
You can assign another chore if you're ready to move on.

682
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,120
Finalize your assignments with the assign button.

683
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,980
I'm gonna also cook dinner.

684
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,680
Ambitious.

685
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,280
Complex.

686
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,420
Messy.

687
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,860
I think Burbson can handle this.

688
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,600
Go to the beach.

689
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,520
Oh, not enough.

690
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,240
Wait, what do you mean I have...

691
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,280
Oh, that's my money.

692
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,380
Okay, yeah.

693
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:39,660
Aside.

694
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,040
And that's how a typical day would go.

695
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,200
And that's how a typical day would go.

696
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,700
Normally, you'll get to see how the date between the two residents goes.

697
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,160
Normally, you'll get to see how the date between the two residents goes.

698
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,420
But that one wasn't worth watching.

699
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,260
But that one wasn't worth watching.

700
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Wait, I don't get it.

701
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,820
Yeah, that's exactly what they sound like.

702
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,400
Anyways, you have a limited number of ghost action points per day.

703
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,460
So keep that in mind when deciding what to do.

704
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,760
As residents care more for each other, you'll be able to watch their relationship grow.

705
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,860
With enough love, there will be a new development in the relationship that you can unlock and watch.

706
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,780
I feel very voyeuristic right now.

707
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,820
And now you've completely completed your training.

708
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,760
Congrats!

709
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,560
You are now a certified ghost.

710
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,960
What does that even mean?

711
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,480
Listen, be proud.

712
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,000
That's a very rough process.

713
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,800
You had to die for it.

714
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,200
But here's your reward.

715
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,440
Certificate for being a ghost!

716
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,380
I'm

717
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,360
so happy!

718
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,300
Oh my gosh.

719
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,340
You just moved from the voyeur hotel.

720
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,220
I'm just kidding.

721
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,140
Oh, look here.

722
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,320
We've got tons of resident applications during your training.

723
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,240
As your real reward, you get to choose the first four residents.

724
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,380
Wait, what about Person?

725
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,240
No, no, I want Person to stay.

726
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,420
I've grown attached.

727
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,460
Please let Person stay.

728
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,620
I get to choose the first four residents.

729
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,240
But Person!

730
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,000
Person!

731
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,100
Thanks for the super giant!

732
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:25,500
Person!

733
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,160
Is that a lizard?

734
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,200
Wait, that's a dragon?

735
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,520
What the heck?

736
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,740
Oh my god, frog.

737
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,060
Okay, hold on.

738
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,780
Okay, alright.

739
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,220
We're gonna do...

740
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,160
We're gonna...

741
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,460
Wow.

742
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,060
Okay, hold on.

743
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,260
We're gonna do the frog.

744
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,220
We're gonna do lizard.

745
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,520
We're gonna do the robot.

746
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,920
And we're gonna do a...

747
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,520
Tiger.

748
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,190
Frog.

749
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,030
This one... Ami is cute though.

750
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,710
I need more space for all my experiments!

751
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:14,430
Please pick me!

752
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,550
Actually wait, Ami's kinda cute.

753
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,250
So is Mina.

754
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,050
I need my own space.

755
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,250
I can live just fine on my own!

756
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,010
Had my heart broken.

757
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,290
Everything reminds me of her.

758
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,230
So here I am.

759
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,590
Oh my gosh, Gerard.

760
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:35,610
I've always lived on my own because honestly, you're my best roommate!

761
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,890
But I should probably talk to other people!

762
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,080
House tiger?

763
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,280
That's what I'm saying!

764
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,460
Prepare the tiger and robot for taiga- Taiga Saiba!

765
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,420
Okay, you're so right.

766
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,100
Okay, continue.

767
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,460
Confirm.

768
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,460
Well, we all have ghost stuff to do.

769
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,380
So I'm gonna leave you here to do what you want in the manor.

770
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,620
All four residents will be moving in tomorrow.

771
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,460
So try your best.

772
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,760
I'll check in on you after three days.

773
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,560
Welcome to your afterlife!

774
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,900
See you later!

775
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,140
Day...

776
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:16,840
Two...

777
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,380
Day two...

778
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,940
Day one?

779
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,640
A resident is arriving!

780
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,700
Oh my gosh!

781
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,100
Oh my gosh!

782
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,880
What's happening?

783
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:28,900
What's happening?

784
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,740
Oh...

785
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,240
He's so competent!

786
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,320
It's Apollo!

787
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,320
A resident is arriving!

788
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,760
Royalty is here.

789
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,680
Who is this?

790
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,660
A frog!

791
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:53,600
Kissing this frog will turn into a dashing prince.

792
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,480
Oh my gosh.

793
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,360
A talent!

794
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,620
A resident is arriving!

795
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,500
A resident is arriving!

796
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:04,700
Oh my gosh.

797
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,380
Robot.

798
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,720
Oh no.

799
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,540
Guys, I like robots.

800
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,960
Oh my gosh, robot is taking...

801
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,460
It's Beeple!

802
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,300
Lost, welcome to membership, thank you!

803
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,640
A resident is arriving.

804
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:19,920
A resident is arriving.

805
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:26,590
A resident is arriving.

806
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,310
Me, for real, for real.

807
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,190
It's...

808
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:31,130
Chamble?

809
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:32,210
Camel?

810
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,770
But they're a lizard, but their name is...

811
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:38,290
Camel.

812
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,390
Camille?

813
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:45,230
Oh...

814
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:47,590
Oh, Camille!

815
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,410
Okay, okay, okay, like chameleon.

816
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,090
Oh,

817
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,630
I think the horns...

818
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:00,650
Oh wait, I think they're kind of I think the horns and the wings are not real.

819
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,430
Wait, I just realized this.

820
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,850
I think they're cosplaying like...

821
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:05,810
Solid Snake.

822
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,170
Oh my gosh, here we go.

823
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,750
Look at them!

824
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,510
Oh my gosh, they're in their houses.

825
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,470
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, what's that?

826
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,810
Oh, I can steal their stuff!

827
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,890
Okay, we gotta pair these guys.

828
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:18,350
Oh.

829
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,890
Log report number one.

830
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,970
Moved into a new biome today.

831
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,830
Excited to observe and perhaps even find a new companion.

832
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:34,470
To mimic my surroundings, henceforth my log reports shall be in the form of a diary entry.

833
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,790
I'm already learning so much.

834
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,090
The music is so cute, so relaxing.

835
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:43,890
Check the computer.

836
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,310
Dead it.

837
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,150
No, that is not Solid Snake.

838
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,630
How do I know who I want to matchmake?

839
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:59,010
OMG, everyone is so cute, but I don't want to accidentally commit the wrong pair of residents.

840
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,910
How do I decide... oh, how did you decide who to ship?

841
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:06,450
Oh, you can totally ship them around with each other and figure out who you want to focus on.

842
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,170
How did you know that?

843
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,530
Because I totally ship them around with each other.

844
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,910
OMG, did they hate each other when you did that?

845
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:15,190
It takes some time to fully...

846
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,330
Nah, it takes some time to fully develop their feelings.

847
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:20,410
So you can experiment with couples before they fully commit.

848
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,250
You reply deleted my user!

849
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:25,570
Oh.

850
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,250
Thumbs down, thumbs down, thumbs down, thumbs down.

851
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,590
Point and laugh at the cosplayer.

852
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:34,650
Oh.

853
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,010
Is the dragon also a cosplayer?

854
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,130
What are you talking about?

855
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,970
Help, I skipped the tutorial!

856
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,130
I skipped the tutorial and now I don't know what to do!

857
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,490
Thumbs down, thumbs down, thumbs down.

858
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,370
CLDR, you died, now you're a ghost.

859
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,150
I died?

860
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,370
Oh buddy, you missed some good jokes.

861
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,870
Maybe you shouldn't have skipped it.

862
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,210
You're a matchmaker and your goal is to create cute couples.

863
00:39:55,510 --> 00:40:01,330
You have a limited number of action points per day that can be used for stealing items, gifting, or assigning residents to the chore board.

864
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,130
Different chores have different goals.

865
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:06,470
Some increase relationship levels and some increase resident happiness.

866
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,850
Remember, residents have preference for certain items and chores.

867
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,430
You can also buy and sell items on Beepbay.

868
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,910
Oh, sorry, Eepbay.

869
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,610
Oh, and Ghostina, best mentor ever, will check on you in three days.

870
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:18,670
Tutorial?

871
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,710
They told me it was training.

872
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:20,850
I knew it!

873
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:22,770
Conspiracy theory?

874
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,700
I can sell some of this stuff.

875
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,780
We know!

876
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,560
Okay, let's see.

877
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,700
Oh, they all have little diaries and stuff too.

878
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,300
I can take all this stuff.

879
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,200
Okay, hold on.

880
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,080
Let's read.

881
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,220
Let's read.

882
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,180
Oh my gosh, he's so sporty.

883
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,660
But he had that, he's also a nerd.

884
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,680
He had that space book, right?

885
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:53,560
Oh!

886
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,980
Wait, what'd you say, Evan?

887
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,300
Oh!

888
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,440
Starting the search for a new job!

889
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,600
Wish me luck, Boris, and thanks for all the love and encouragement you give us every day.

890
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,840
Evan, good luck!

891
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,820
You got this.

892
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,560
You got this.

893
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,060
You got this.

894
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,560
You got this.

895
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,040
You got this.

896
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,500
You got this.

897
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:07,940
You got this.

898
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,420
You got this.

899
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,020
He's staring right at me.

900
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,860
I think he knows I'm here.

901
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,280
Dear diary, I'm so excited to be here.

902
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,800
Everyone here looks like they're full of potential.

903
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,260
Potential to be a friend.

904
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,840
He's already friend-zoning everybody.

905
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,220
Boo!

906
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:28,900
Boo!

907
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,600
What's this?

908
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,680
We got no mail.

909
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,740
It literally just was a puff of smoke.

910
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,020
Dear diary, no doorman.

911
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,360
No bellboy.

912
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,480
No maid.

913
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,300
No!

914
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,200
I'm right here!

915
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,740
I don't like this reply feature.

916
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,640
Stop!

917
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,340
No maid.

918
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,540
No chauffeur.

919
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,240
This simply won't do.

920
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:05,660
I suppose I shall take the reins and show everybody everyone how to truly live life.

921
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,840
Dear diary...

922
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,600
Oh, what is this information?

923
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,000
Ah!

924
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,140
Interesting.

925
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,300
They love the cosplay!

926
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,120
Hiding underneath their creations.

927
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:19,820
What a nerd.

928
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,180
Beep.

929
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:22,720
Beepo.

930
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,540
Beepo is gonna go hard, okay.

931
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:24,680
Okay.

932
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,640
Dear diary.

933
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,560
New places.

934
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,420
New faces.

935
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,140
Eep!

936
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,760
It's everything I feared it would be.

937
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,560
Hopefully, no one will notice me.

938
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:35,620
Nerd.

939
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,580
You're a nerd.

940
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,440
You're a nerd.

941
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,460
You're a nerd.

942
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,520
You're a nerd.

943
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,400
You're a nerd.

944
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:42,720
Camel.

945
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,460
What is if I interact with this?

946
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,360
Oh, fancy backpack.

947
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,520
Oh, I could sell it!

948
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,480
Oh, this one is for sunscreen, books, and tickets.

949
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:52,880
Okay.

950
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,560
Alright, guys.

951
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,940
This one is for pretending you have books.

952
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,280
But it's all snacks.

953
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,580
Alright, time to start giving things and taking things.

954
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,500
What do you think...

955
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,360
Okay, hold on.

956
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,090
I think...

957
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,070
I think they would want something...

958
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,170
Um...

959
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,330
What would tiger or robot want?

960
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,410
Yeah, I don't know if these rooms have doors.

961
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:28,830
They're just there.

962
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:29,810
You know, don't worry about it.

963
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:31,870
The tiger might want an apple.

964
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:32,990
Because he's fit!

965
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:33,670
True.

966
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,490
Okay, we're gonna steal this one then.

967
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:36,410
Lazy?

968
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:37,390
Unusual.

969
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:39,830
Wait, why are the...

970
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,630
Oh, last place pair.

971
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,930
The worst pair ever!

972
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,230
You guys, we can't... This is a pair!

973
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,030
This is not a good quality gift.

974
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:48,090
This is bad.

975
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:49,730
This is bad, bad, bad.

976
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:51,610
Oh, check eBay.

977
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,750
Oh, I can buy stuff, can't I?

978
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,290
I only have four bucks though.

979
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:57,830
Four ghost dollars.

980
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,900
The tiger might want an apple is not the word I was expecting.

981
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,020
Ambitious nerdy!

982
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,400
How is a trophy nerdy?

983
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,480
This is best on it.

984
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,160
This is kinda cute.

985
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,800
None of these are great quality gifts.

986
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,140
Oh, this is...

987
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,080
A unicycle!

988
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,400
Okay, this one is probably...

989
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,560
Active, adventurous, ambitious.

990
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,740
Okay, hold on.

991
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,680
What was the tiger's tags?

992
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,860
What are you about?

993
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,600
Loves to see everyone live their life.

994
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,660
Oh, their best life.

995
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,560
Somehow he's also everyone's best friend.

996
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,280
Okay, we're gonna give him a unicycle.

997
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,800
His tags!

998
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,560
That's what they're called!

999
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,960
My head is blocking it!

1000
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,340
It's the tags!

1001
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,480
It's the tags, I promise!

1002
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:55,120
It's the tags, I promise!

1003
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:55,200
It's the tags, I promise!

1004
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,840
I'm not just making this up!

1005
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:01,280
I'm not just making this up!

1006
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,460
Okay.

1007
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:03,880
Steal!

1008
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,680
Nice, okay.

1009
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,980
We're gonna give this to you.

1010
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,760
It's from Beep.

1011
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,120
It's from Beeple.

1012
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,400
Oh!

1013
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,060
Oh my gosh, our first gift!

1014
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,940
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh...

1015
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:24,620
Beeple!

1016
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,140
Beep...

1017
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,600
Beeple loves...

1018
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,360
Oh my gosh!

1019
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:31,760
Discovered tag!

1020
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,280
Feel their talk in the common room.

1021
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:37,840
Feel their talk in the common room.

1022
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:40,560
Beeple!

1023
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,260
It's so good to see you!

1024
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,580
Thank you, Apollo.

1025
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:46,920
Thank you, Apollo.

1026
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,760
I wanted you to know...

1027
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,040
I've really been enjoying my time with you.

1028
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,180
Does that mean we're friends?

1029
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,340
It means we're best friends.

1030
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,240
I love spending time with you!

1031
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,160
Best friends?

1032
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,900
Don't stop friendzoning, Beeple, please!

1033
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,040
Don't stop friendzoning, Beeple, please!

1034
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,400
Yup, you're the best, Beeple.

1035
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,240
Yup, you're the best, Beeple.

1036
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,280
Wasn't ready for what?

1037
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,200
I have to go now.

1038
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:16,880
I'm sorry.

1039
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,340
Goodbye!

1040
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,440
But wait, before I go...

1041
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,360
I also want you to know...

1042
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,140
I all enjoy spending time with you too.

1043
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,680
I also want you to know...

1044
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,120
I all enjoy spending time with you too.

1045
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:27,960
I love Beeple.

1046
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,780
So please remember that.

1047
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:33,700
Uh...

1048
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:34,300
Okay.

1049
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,580
Watch your first relationship talk!

1050
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,180
Watch your first relationship talk!

1051
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,840
Watch your first relationship talk!

1052
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,580
Beeple, are you okay?

1053
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,480
Was it too much for you?

1054
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,440
Okay, let's see what the chores are.

1055
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,940
If we could hook up...

1056
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,320
If these two would hook up, would their child be...

1057
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,880
Tigatron from Beasties?

1058
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,800
Do a paint kit at home.

1059
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,560
Compliment someone.

1060
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:05,940
That's a chore?

1061
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,960
Water all the plants.

1062
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,480
Oh, check Beeple's diary.

1063
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:16,480
Does it work?

1064
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,160
I think it'll light up though, right?

1065
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,480
I think it'll light up though, right?

1066
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,840
Yeah, I think it's per day.

1067
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:22,700
It seems.

1068
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:25,780
Oh, okay, so...

1069
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,540
Q, this is the end of the day.

1070
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,540
Sorry, you guys are kind of blocking it, but...

1071
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:31,840
Um...

1072
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:34,520
Wait...

1073
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,060
Oh, oh my gosh!

1074
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,280
This scared me.

1075
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:40,780
Why are you hiding in your own room?

1076
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,580
Why are you hiding in your own room?

1077
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,120
Um...

1078
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,260
Okay, let's do some chores.

1079
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,120
We have two activity points left.

1080
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:52,860
Vento?

1081
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,920
Thanks for the gift, dude.

1082
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,060
Well, dude...

1083
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:06,570
Oh, it's only one.

1084
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:07,250
Okay, perfect.

1085
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,450
And then...

1086
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:10,150
House helper.

1087
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:11,990
Camel.

1088
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:17,370
Okie dokie.

1089
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:18,410
I think that's it.

1090
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,570
Alright, end the day.

1091
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:24,630
Psst!

1092
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:26,550
Ghostina.

1093
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:27,190
Gondolas.

1094
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:30,410
I got you some tickets to watch today's Totally Not A Date.

1095
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:33,450
We ghosties like to watch residents go on these.

1096
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:34,290
Damn!

1097
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:34,910
Thank you!

1098
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,990
They can be full of fun, cute romance!

1099
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:43,630
Or full of awkwardness.

1100
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:45,950
Oh no, oh no, you guys, it might be awkward.

1101
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:48,310
Oh no, I might get some second hand embarrassment.

1102
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:49,710
Oh no.

1103
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:54,950
Some residents might even have super special reactions to dates that speak particularly to them.

1104
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:58,670
Based on how well the dates go, the greater the impact of the relationship.

1105
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:01,790
Let's see how you did for your first Totally Not A Date assignment.

1106
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:04,670
See you tonight for the premiere!

1107
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,670
Oh no, guys, it might be cringe.

1108
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:07,950
Later that day...

1109
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:09,110
Oh my gosh!

1110
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:10,590
Everybody's here for the premiere!

1111
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:12,130
What the heck?

1112
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:13,990
That's me in the audience.

1113
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:18,510
I guess we're supposed to use this kit to paint by numbers.

1114
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:21,610
Oh, wait, that was Beeple, sorry.

1115
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:23,770
I thought we were supposed to paint by colors.

1116
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:27,010
It's a bunch of pervs in here.

1117
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:28,390
Yeah, everybody's watching!

1118
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:31,210
Oh my gosh, this is so embarrassing!

1119
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:33,910
Is this how real dates are?

1120
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:35,610
Everybody's just watching your date?

1121
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:36,430
All the ghosts?

1122
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,490
You guys, I will say...

1123
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:44,130
I have never watched somebody's date.

1124
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:46,910
Actually, that's a lie.

1125
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:50,750
There was that one couple that was at that restaurant.

1126
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:52,090
They did not look happy.

1127
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:57,010
I was definitely paying more attention to them than the seafood.

1128
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:02,680
I was definitely paying more attention to them than the seafood.

1129
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,680
Well, yes, but each number has a color associated with it.

1130
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,340
Wait, how long has it been this way?

1131
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,420
No, it's just for this.

1132
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,680
I have so many things to recolor!

1133
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,240
This changes everything!

1134
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:15,920
No, no, no, watch.

1135
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,020
My mint ghost could never be cringe ever.

1136
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,440
I refuse to believe that.

1137
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,640
Chat, you are all very rude.

1138
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,640
Does the basketball ass count?

1139
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,820
Oh, that's not a date though.

1140
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:29,640
Oh, I guess it...

1141
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,100
Stop

1142
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:34,960
it.

1143
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,400
It doesn't feel like it counts.

1144
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,540
Okay, they are painting.

1145
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:46,660
Okay, I did it.

1146
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,900
Zonko, welcome to Mambo Chef.

1147
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:49,300
Thank you.

1148
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,580
You sure did.

1149
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,100
This was a lot of fun.

1150
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,660
Thanks for calming me down, people.

1151
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,240
Anytime, Apollo.

1152
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,020
Woo!

1153
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,020
They were cheering.

1154
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,800
They got like a standing ovation.

1155
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:07,400
Holy cow.

1156
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,780
Date was good.

1157
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,940
If I ever get another date, you can come along, mint.

1158
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,180
Um...

1159
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:26,880
Hmm...

1160
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,940
The house helper task was okay.

1161
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:39,100
Camel's relationship with all other residents slightly increased.

1162
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,020
Nobody likes frog burp.

1163
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,740
Okay.

1164
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,780
This is actual crickets.

1165
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:51,960
Good.

1166
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,680
Oh my gosh, it's one of these thingies!

1167
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,800
The tatamatoms!

1168
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,140
Musical note toy.

1169
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,660
Sounds silly, but trust me.

1170
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,340
Trust me, bro.

1171
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,900
What's going on Undeadit?

1172
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,140
Gifting.

1173
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,140
How do I know if a gift is good?

1174
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,260
Are there bad gifts?

1175
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,800
Every gift boosts happiness slash romance.

1176
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,300
I really like a gift.

1177
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,300
You can see a ton of hearts slash emojis fly out of them faster.

1178
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:20,020
That was...

1179
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,600
They're hanging out.

1180
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:24,920
You guys.

1181
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,720
They're hanging out.

1182
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,080
Without me prompting them.

1183
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,060
They're in...

1184
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:32,500
the...

1185
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,540
Oh my gosh, sorry.

1186
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,600
I was like, what's going on?

1187
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,600
They're hanging out.

1188
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:39,680
Dear Dairon.

1189
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:45,600
I had so much fun on an expedition with Apollo yesterday that I forgot to take field notes.

1190
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,360
Maybe those memories will be just for me then.

1191
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,320
So cute!

1192
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,640
So cute!

1193
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,240
Dear Dairon.

1194
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,780
Did I upset Beepo by calling them my best friend?

1195
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,260
I'm not sure what's going on.

1196
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:02,880
Uh oh.

1197
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,180
Uh oh.

1198
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,600
The Apollo expedition.

1199
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,100
APOLLO EXPEDITION!

1200
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,320
Shut up.

1201
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:17,600
The Apollo Expedition, you guys.

1202
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,340
This might be the most perfect match ever.

1203
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:28,780
This might be the most perfect...

1204
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:29,260
Wait!

1205
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,080
Beepo's charging.

1206
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,620
What the heck is this?

1207
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,100
Architecture shapes.

1208
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,040
Why are we gifting baby toys?

1209
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,460
Aren't these adults?

1210
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:47,500
Oh!

1211
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,060
I think the frog would like the mirror, right?

1212
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:53,880
Oh no.

1213
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:58,420
Frog did not have an interesting enough day to write in the diary.

1214
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,580
Neither did camel.

1215
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:00,380
Uh oh.

1216
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,260
Okay.

1217
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,680
Where did Beepo plug in?

1218
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:05,860
Hey, chill out.

1219
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,280
Okay, chill out!

1220
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,400
What is this, too?

1221
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:15,370
Oh.

1222
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:15,910
Oh.

1223
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,420
This seems a little too sensitive of a gift, I think.

1224
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:33,010
Hold on.

1225
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:33,990
We were reading dead it.

1226
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:35,030
I got distracted.

1227
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:37,210
Um...

1228
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:42,090
You'll also see in your information menu if you unlocked a new tag if it's something they really liked.

1229
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:42,430
Dang!

1230
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:44,230
We really hit it on the mark then with Apollo.

1231
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:48,170
Higher quality items are also more effective than lower quality ones.

1232
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:48,870
Oh well.

1233
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:49,970
Who doesn't like gifts?

1234
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:54,970
I mean, I like free gifts, but if someone left a skeleton in my room, I'd hesitate at least a little.

1235
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:00,350
We got a toaster?

1236
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:00,890
Okay.

1237
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:07,570
I don't think that frog and camel are a good match, but we'll start matching them.

1238
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:08,930
It might work.

1239
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:09,650
Right?

1240
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:10,710
Fancy.

1241
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:11,550
Fashionable.

1242
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,970
We need frog to be happy, too.

1243
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,130
It's from...

1244
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:21,750
Camel.

1245
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:26,490
Yeah.

1246
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,430
This appeared out of nowhere.

1247
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:30,450
Ooh!

1248
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:33,770
They love the gift.

1249
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:37,670
Look at the membership!

1250
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:38,750
Fancy!

1251
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:41,130
And fashionable.

1252
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:43,710
Look at this!

1253
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:44,790
Look at the hearts!

1254
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:47,850
Wait, the hearts are really sparking, you guys.

1255
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:52,330
I think frog and lizard can be a perfect couple.

1256
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:54,110
Fancy.

1257
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:56,350
Camel.

1258
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:59,050
The chameleon I wanted to see.

1259
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:00,830
Oh, um...

1260
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:01,610
Um, hello.

1261
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:06,030
I have been told you specialize in cloth and thread.

1262
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:08,050
Oh, um, yes.

1263
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,170
I guess you could say that.

1264
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,970
I have a request to make of you.

1265
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:14,190
Oh, like a commission?

1266
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:15,850
Y-yeah, that...

1267
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:18,330
You see, I have an event coming up.

1268
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:22,430
I need only the best fabrics and details.

1269
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,170
All eyes will be on me, after all.

1270
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:28,330
So I need it to be nothing less than extravagant.

1271
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:29,670
Oh, dear.

1272
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:32,130
Would you be able to fashion me...

1273
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:32,670
Oh my gosh, wait.

1274
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:33,810
This is just dress-up, darling.

1275
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:42,310
This is just bisque doll, you guys.

1276
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:46,310
Oh, no.

1277
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:53,450
Would you be able to fashion me a lovely robe?

1278
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:55,910
Well, I'm not sure of my style.

1279
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:56,950
Nonsense.

1280
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:00,650
Listen, I don't have time to discuss at the moment.

1281
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:04,190
Make me a lovely robe, and you will be compensated greatly.

1282
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:05,970
Ta-ta!

1283
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:08,010
Oh, gosh.

1284
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,530
What kind of robe did he want again?

1285
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:11,570
This is such a huge ask.

1286
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:12,330
Oh, gosh.

1287
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:13,010
I'm sweating again.

1288
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:15,030
Okay, you can do this, camel.

1289
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:22,690
So no lisque doll?

1290
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:25,110
Oh, my gosh.

1291
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:26,690
I'm like, peeping through the floor.

1292
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:27,990
I'm such a creep.

1293
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:31,070
I'm such a creep, I'm such a creep, I'm such a creep.

1294
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:35,310
Look at the bamboo shoe!

1295
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:36,650
Thank you!

1296
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:37,970
Alright, let's see.

1297
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:40,570
What would maybe...

1298
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:41,750
What is this one?

1299
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:42,850
Oh, they're hanging out!

1300
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:45,570
They're talking about vacuum cleaners?

1301
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,600
I think...

1302
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:04,440
Okay.

1303
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:11,720
I'm afraid that if we give the toaster to Robot, to Beeple, that they might think of it as another lover.

1304
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,120
So maybe the musical instrument.

1305
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,000
Steal!

1306
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:22,360
Is it me or does this house not have any doors?

1307
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,280
Don't worry!

1308
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,120
It's like a doll house, you know?

1309
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,300
Oh, okay.

1310
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,640
This is the perfect time to gift this.

1311
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:28,580
Beeple's charging.

1312
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,360
From Apollo.

1313
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,040
They kinda liked it.

1314
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,660
They thought it was okay.

1315
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:43,860
Wait, that's it?

1316
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,500
I can even take it back?

1317
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,520
No way.

1318
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,440
Beeple, we didn't like it.

1319
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,080
Beeple...

1320
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,020
That's our first miss, you guys.

1321
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:04,120
Okay, time to end the date.

1322
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,640
Date to summary.

1323
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:09,260
Gifts.

1324
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,040
Fancy!

1325
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,000
Thank you!

1326
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:24,820
Okie dokie.

1327
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:30,770
Back to the internet.

1328
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:33,650
Did you know that you can watch dates?

1329
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:34,550
Spoopy girl.

1330
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:35,610
Oh my gosh.

1331
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:36,810
The dates are so cute.

1332
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,390
I need to talk to someone about them.

1333
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:39,390
OMG, what?

1334
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:41,090
I haven't assigned anyone to a date yet.

1335
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:44,390
Yeah, after you assign them to a date, you'll see how it goes later that day.

1336
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:45,830
OMG, you're missing out.

1337
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:47,610
My favorite so far is the karaoke date!

1338
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:48,830
It was so adorable.

1339
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:50,690
Wait, the karaoke date?

1340
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,530
Wait, I did the karaoke date.

1341
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:53,570
It was super awkward.

1342
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:55,590
Well, maybe you need to pick better couples.

1343
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:57,330
I can't believe I missed so much!

1344
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:58,490
Where did my legs go?

1345
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:02,030
You gonna finish Eternal Darkness?

1346
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:02,830
Yeah, I am!

1347
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:04,330
But I'm not home.

1348
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:06,250
Um...

1349
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:07,010
I'm in Japan.

1350
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:09,810
I don't have my GameCube, obviously.

1351
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:12,170
So, um, yeah.

1352
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:14,610
Once I'm back home though, I'll be able to finish it.

1353
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:19,170
Yes, yes, yes.

1354
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:20,410
Oh, there it is!

1355
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:22,550
Okay, so you can't steal...

1356
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:25,190
Why is there a snowman in the kitchen?

1357
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:28,330
Dear diary, I always tell you how I'm feeling.

1358
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:30,470
And I just want to thank you for being there for me.

1359
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:31,690
Keep up the great work.

1360
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:36,130
It doesn't feel right reading a diary entry like that.

1361
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:43,950
Dear diary, I got a filigree mirror from Camel.

1362
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:45,010
This is perfect.

1363
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:48,870
It's going right next to where I keep my favorite crowns.

1364
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,210
I knew it was a perfect gift.

1365
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:52,330
Wait, where's the mirror?

1366
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:55,050
Wait, where is it?

1367
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:01,250
Where's the mirror?

1368
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:07,990
Next to the crowns.

1369
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:09,310
Well, where are the crowns?

1370
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,070
Doesn't everybody keep a snowman in the kitchen?

1371
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,110
Or is it just us Canadians?

1372
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:16,110
Oh, there it is.

1373
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:16,650
Oh my god.

1374
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,630
Can I go underneath the house?

1375
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:21,270
No.

1376
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:22,730
I cannot go into the foundation.

1377
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:26,810
Dear diary, I can do this.

1378
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:27,630
I can do this.

1379
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:32,490
Holland didn't really specify what kind of robes he wanted, so I guess I'll have to go with this design.

1380
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:33,770
Okay.

1381
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:35,050
What is this?

1382
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:36,330
A thermos?

1383
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:37,330
Oh, portable speaker!

1384
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:39,390
Oh...

1385
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:41,810
Okay...

1386
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:44,410
And the snowman...

1387
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:46,470
Messy snowman.

1388
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,430
Why did somebody build this indoors?

1389
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:52,190
We could...

1390
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:54,050
Okay, we should start selling stuff too, right?

1391
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:58,110
Because then we can buy new stuff.

1392
01:01:58,270 --> 01:01:59,750
Like the fancy painting!

1393
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,450
Oh my gosh, wait.

1394
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:04,790
Wait!

1395
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:08,090
This is perfect for frog!

1396
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:09,830
What the hell is this?

1397
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:11,710
A basket cube.

1398
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:15,470
But then probably...

1399
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:18,770
Apollo will love this.

1400
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,670
We need cash money, you guys.

1401
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:27,430
Someone soiled it!

1402
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:31,030
Why does it have eyes?

1403
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:32,710
I was wondering that too.

1404
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:36,410
How often do you think a fancy painting comes along?

1405
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:40,350
I don't think we can sell enough stuff to buy it, you know?

1406
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:56,330
Okay, let's do some math, everybody.

1407
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:57,830
Ten?

1408
01:02:59,030 --> 01:02:59,990
But wait...

1409
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:02,370
It costs interaction points to pick up everything.

1410
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:04,230
Okay, one, ten...

1411
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:05,050
How many do I need?

1412
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:07,090
Forty-one.

1413
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:07,550
Okay.

1414
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:09,390
Ten...

1415
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:10,570
This one...

1416
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:11,290
Was this one expensive?

1417
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:12,870
No.

1418
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:16,950
Ten plus ten...

1419
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:17,510
Twenty!

1420
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:21,710
Plus...

1421
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:24,510
No!

1422
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:25,950
No!

1423
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:27,610
I don't think we'll make enough!

1424
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:32,790
It's so over...

1425
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:35,390
I don't think it's happening...

1426
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:36,210
No!

1427
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:42,810
Okay, well let's give this to...

1428
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:44,250
Wait, but this is fourteen!

1429
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:46,910
Wait!

1430
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:48,850
That'd be...

1431
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:50,670
That would be...

1432
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:52,230
Thirty-four...

1433
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:54,270
Plus four...

1434
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:55,230
Thirty-eight...

1435
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:57,950
I would have to sell everything to get it.

1436
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:00,870
I would have to grab everything and use all my points.

1437
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:11,030
Dang it...

1438
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:13,990
Okay, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna steal the...

1439
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:15,290
Steal?

1440
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:17,850
I'm gonna place this down here.

1441
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:20,050
It's another action point to place, right?

1442
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:24,830
Oh no, it's not.

1443
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:25,610
Okay, from Beeple.

1444
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:27,730
Oh yes it is.

1445
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:28,130
Just kidding.

1446
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:29,470
Hold on.

1447
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:30,310
Hold on.

1448
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:30,770
Because...

1449
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,930
What I also want to do...

1450
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:34,690
Wait, I can do this!

1451
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:36,430
I can sell one thing...

1452
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:38,450
And then I can also...

1453
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:40,630
Have a date happen.

1454
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:44,850
So I'm gonna sell...

1455
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:47,790
Something that is low quality...

1456
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:48,850
But makes a lot of money.

1457
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:49,270
A lot of money.

1458
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:57,130
These are all kind of low quality.

1459
01:04:57,550 --> 01:04:59,290
So I don't want to sell the large...

1460
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:00,810
Okay, grab it.

1461
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:01,970
Hold on.

1462
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:02,830
Let's gift this.

1463
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:03,850
Wait, where did he go?

1464
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,220
Oh, they're hanging out.

1465
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:11,040
How do you know each other?

1466
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:12,660
Excuse me.

1467
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,620
Go away.

1468
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,140
Come get your gift.

1469
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:22,300
From Beeple.

1470
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:29,880
Turn around!

1471
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:30,360
Turn around!

1472
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:30,820
Turn around!

1473
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,300
Turn around!

1474
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:31,780
Turn around!

1475
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:32,140
Turn around!

1476
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:32,800
Yeah!

1477
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,880
Oh my gosh, they're all hanging out.

1478
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:38,220
He loves it!

1479
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:38,640
He loves it!

1480
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:38,980
He loves it!

1481
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:39,360
He loves it!

1482
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:41,140
Basket cube.

1483
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:48,100
Beeple.

1484
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:50,680
Hi, Apollo.

1485
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,780
Did you receive my gift?

1486
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,980
That was literally me though.

1487
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:56,940
Why are you taking the credit?

1488
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:58,680
Okay, Beeple is kind of a psycho.

1489
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:00,900
That depends.

1490
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:06,120
Was your gift to me a hundred card signed from your best friend, Beeple?

1491
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:07,860
Oh, good.

1492
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:09,940
I was afraid it would be lost in the mail.

1493
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,880
So I sent in 99 more.

1494
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,640
Just in case.

1495
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:15,400
Oh, okay.

1496
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:16,560
It wasn't the basket cube.

1497
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:18,960
Thanks, I appreciate it.

1498
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,040
But next time, I think one card will be enough.

1499
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:22,860
Understood.

1500
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,880
By the way, I noticed your have a lot of friends.

1501
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:28,460
Yeah, I guess I do tend to make friends.

1502
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:29,260
Friends?

1503
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,500
I can't even say the word.

1504
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,760
I'm so antisocial, I can't even say the word.

1505
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,000
Friends.

1506
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,180
Pretty easily.

1507
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,220
One of them.

1508
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,540
One of them is an Olympic athlete.

1509
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,020
A wrestler, correct?

1510
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:51,700
Yeah, we trained together back in high school.

1511
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:52,700
Why do you ask?

1512
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,760
Oh, because I'm going to have to defeat them in wrestling.

1513
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:57,540
Let's go, Beepo.

1514
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:59,140
Let's go, Beepo.

1515
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:00,960
Wait, what?

1516
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:03,160
Okay, I have to go train.

1517
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:05,640
I'll see you after I defeated them, Apollo.

1518
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:06,480
Bye.

1519
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:09,840
Wait, Beepo, come back!

1520
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:14,190
Let's go.

1521
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:15,430
I kind of love Beepo.

1522
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:16,450
Beepo's got ambition.

1523
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,880
Let's assign these two.

1524
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,040
Oh, wait.

1525
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:32,040
Definitely... collecting seashells!

1526
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,400
Okay, here we go.

1527
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:35,040
For some reason...

1528
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:38,060
All in and camel.

1529
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,020
There we go.

1530
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:40,160
Assigned.

1531
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,280
Okay, and then we'll take this guy and we're going to sell him.

1532
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:50,600
Yes.

1533
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:51,480
Okay, good.

1534
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,240
Beepo gives Yandere vibes, maybe a little.

1535
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:56,680
Sell.

1536
01:07:59,000 --> 01:07:59,660
Money, money!

1537
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:00,220
We're going to try!

1538
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,080
Okay, sell one thing a day, guys.

1539
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,560
This is kind of a good...

1540
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:05,600
Kind of a good...

1541
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:07,100
Maybe...

1542
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:08,780
Formula.

1543
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,320
You give one gift.

1544
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,880
You sell one thing and you assign one day.

1545
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:16,300
There's all your points.

1546
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:17,460
For the day.

1547
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:20,580
Everybody good?

1548
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:21,340
Everybody happy?

1549
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,720
Okay, end the day.

1550
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:27,060
We're maximizing.

1551
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,620
We're min-maxing the ghost game.

1552
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:34,860
Seashell collecting?

1553
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,200
What's this music?

1554
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:38,820
I hope we're good at this.

1555
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:42,420
You guys, I think this is the...

1556
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:43,680
I don't think this is the good music.

1557
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,020
I don't see how we could be bad at this.

1558
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:52,920
Look!

1559
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,560
I already found a...

1560
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:57,180
This is a seashell shaped rock.

1561
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:58,800
Well, that's okay.

1562
01:08:58,920 --> 01:08:59,980
I found a...

1563
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:02,720
A seashell shaped water bottle?

1564
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,060
Why is this even here?

1565
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:06,700
Okay.

1566
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,900
This one has got to be a...

1567
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:12,960
Seashell replica by seashell enthusiast society.

1568
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,960
This is PP music, you guys.

1569
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:21,480
This music feels so Tomodachi Live.

1570
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:21,940
You're right.

1571
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,320
Why would you leave this at the beach?

1572
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:28,060
Oh god.

1573
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,100
We're really bad at this?

1574
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,120
They're trauma bonding.

1575
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:34,240
Viewed an awkward date for the first time.

1576
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:39,240
The date was okay.

1577
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,080
Their relationship increased a little.

1578
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:45,340
Cool.

1579
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:48,960
Ghosted.

1580
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:51,100
So...

1581
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,300
How did your first three days go?

1582
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:52,920
Let's see.

1583
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:55,820
I guess that's pretty good for a first timer.

1584
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,340
This is the first time you've been dead, right?

1585
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:01,680
No.

1586
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,860
How many times have you died?

1587
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:07,540
Just one so far.

1588
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,960
Well, you had a great first three days.

1589
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:16,280
The real reward here is your kindness helped blossom love and a happier home.

1590
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,500
We have a store.

1591
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:28,780
The more you develop resident relationships and the more resident happiness you bring the more relationships you get.

1592
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:32,720
Thanks for four months crazy person.

1593
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,400
No, hold on.

1594
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:43,710
No.

1595
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:54,150
Spring, spring.

1596
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:57,850
Spring, spring.

1597
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,300
Good try.

1598
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:10,720
I couldn't remember the crazy frog.

1599
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,300
I couldn't remember it.

1600
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,700
Ghosts love to collect and spend these.

1601
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:19,800
And you can unlock lots of cool stuff with them.

1602
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,140
And with the cool stuff you can unlock in my store you can take your matchmaking to the next level.

1603
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,660
The possibilities are endless.

1604
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,300
Until we run out of things in my store.

1605
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:31,520
But even then.

1606
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:33,960
Shut up.

1607
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,020
She expects more from someone who's multi-died.

1608
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:40,660
You can matchmake any pair of residents you want.

1609
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:47,180
And every resident has a completely different story based on who they've developed a relationship with.

1610
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:51,120
Now go out there and see what kind of a world you can make.

1611
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:55,060
Nah.

1612
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,860
I'll be here if you want to buy anything.

1613
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:00,600
Okay.

1614
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:01,680
Thanks.

1615
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,240
Ghost dinner.

1616
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:04,660
Let's see how you did.

1617
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,700
I did amazing, I did amazing, I did amazing, I did amazing.

1618
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:09,760
Oh my gosh!

1619
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,740
Wait, there's trees?

1620
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,400
Gain plus one action to do a total of five things.

1621
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:19,340
Gain hats for Ghosty to wear?

1622
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:20,920
Gain hats for Ghosty to wear?

1623
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:24,620
Wait, what is this?

1624
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:25,380
Oh, I need fifty.

1625
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,420
There's minigames!

1626
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,300
Unlock a mode to redecorate residents' rooms.

1627
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:32,800
A minigame that requires more coins.

1628
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,460
Requires actions.

1629
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:38,380
Learn a scary song to interact with residents!

1630
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:40,280
Hats?

1631
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:44,160
Yeah, but I can do a plus one action points, guys.

1632
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,200
Change Ghosty's tail!

1633
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,000
Ghosty match residents!

1634
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,520
Gain an item to temporarily move out a resident?

1635
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:03,120
Oh my gosh.

1636
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,100
Ask the vacation ticket to Ipe.

1637
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:06,820
Wow, there's actually a lot.

1638
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,860
I want the scary song.

1639
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:09,760
Wait, there's so much.

1640
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,060
We only have thirty-five points.

1641
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,040
We can only pick one thing.

1642
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,680
And the minigame.

1643
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,100
Earns more coins!

1644
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:28,190
But cosmetics.

1645
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:29,270
And what's this one?

1646
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:32,010
Earn ten percent more money when selling items or playing minigames.

1647
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:38,960
But hats.

1648
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,320
I'm going to do the minigames because I want to see what they are.

1649
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:46,020
Sorry, guys.

1650
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:47,720
Okay.

1651
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:52,030
I want to know what the minigames are.

1652
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:53,870
Now it's time to move on to the next phase.

1653
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:55,350
Super death.

1654
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:58,210
You're going to die again and you'll have a super afterlife.

1655
01:13:58,630 --> 01:13:59,490
Oh, just kidding.

1656
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:01,950
You're going to go back to the manor to develop more relationships.

1657
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:06,210
I really like the romances where you're building.

1658
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:07,290
I want to see more.

1659
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:11,510
Plus, I'll visit my shop in another three days.

1660
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:18,030
For the good of romance, the good of joy in the world, and most importantly, the good of my merchandise shop.

1661
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:20,630
Get out there and make some more romances bloom.

1662
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:21,730
Okay.

1663
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:24,430
Day four.

1664
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:25,690
What is this?

1665
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:27,870
OCD.

1666
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:30,210
Ghosties Love Mix 2002.

1667
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:31,590
Okay.

1668
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:34,770
I got a room upgrade.

1669
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:39,420
What's the upgrade?

1670
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:40,560
What's that?

1671
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:42,880
Something sparkly there.

1672
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,040
Oh, wait.

1673
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:47,260
He's putting in stuff in his room.

1674
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:47,600
I see.

1675
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:51,180
Yay!

1676
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:52,480
You have eep mail now.

1677
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,860
You can write emails to fish...

1678
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:57,100
I mean fish for more ghost monies.

1679
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,220
You better...

1680
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:00,980
The better your scam...

1681
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,700
The better the payout.

1682
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:08,760
We run scams?

1683
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:09,840
Scamming is bad.

1684
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:11,760
So we're going to be scamming scammers.

1685
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:15,100
I tracked down all these ghosties who send annoying scam emails.

1686
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:16,560
And we're going to scam them back.

1687
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,380
This is my forte.

1688
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:25,520
Writing these emails cause ghost action points though.

1689
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,360
So keep that in mind.

1690
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,240
I'm composing an email.

1691
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,900
It's time to write your first email.

1692
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,600
You get an email prompt and you have to fill in the words.

1693
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:41,000
Each word has symbol associated with it and the more symbols that match the more your email will make sense.

1694
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:42,900
Which means more money!

1695
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:45,220
It's like leverage.

1696
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,080
Who scams the scammers?

1697
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:48,780
Me!

1698
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,540
Mint scammed them!

1699
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,460
This is actually a game about mint.

1700
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:57,560
Stop!

1701
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,780
Stop being so right.

1702
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:04,600
Some words have multiple symbols which means they can match with any of those.

1703
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,460
If you want to slow down the words...

1704
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:07,820
you can adjust the speed in the settings.

1705
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:09,860
Good luck out there and happy fishing!

1706
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:13,760
Hi.

1707
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:14,940
It's your...

1708
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,320
loyal fan.

1709
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,120
And I...

1710
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,900
Am making a statue of you!

1711
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,020
And I need money to cover...

1712
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:32,020
The unsolicited replica.

1713
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:33,960
Please send money.

1714
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,720
You are my last hope.

1715
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:38,480
I'm a professional, clever, Atypical money maker.

1716
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:43,100
Perfect run, baby.

1717
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,740
Look, we already got a scammer.

1718
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,360
Read it and collect your money.

1719
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:48,580
Oh wow.

1720
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,340
I've been looking for more merch for myself.

1721
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:50,900
Perfect!

1722
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:52,660
Thank you, ghosty son.

1723
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:57,540
25!

1724
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,980
Holy cow, we don't need to sell that stuff anymore.

1725
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:00,760
Hi.

1726
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:01,820
It's your loyal fan.

1727
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,040
Nano, how are you so fast?

1728
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:08,320
I'm making a statue of you and I need money to cover this unsolicited replica.

1729
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:09,720
Please send money.

1730
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,440
You are my last hope.

1731
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,340
How are you so fast?

1732
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,040
I'm making a statue of you and I need money to cover this unsolicited replica.

1733
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,380
IX300, thanks for the vibe gift!

1734
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,840
Okay, we made a buttload of money just now.

1735
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:23,720
That was awesome.

1736
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:26,920
My residents had an awkward date.

1737
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:27,560
What do I do?

1738
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,260
This has never happened to me before.

1739
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,000
What's going to happen?

1740
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,140
Are they going to hate each other?

1741
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:31,740
I'm freaking out!

1742
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:32,740
Relax.

1743
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:33,720
Take a chill pill.

1744
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:34,300
It's fine.

1745
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,440
They still like each other.

1746
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,600
They just didn't gain as much affection as they could have.

1747
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:38,480
It's NBD.

1748
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:42,640
Residents like certain dates that are better suited for them than others.

1749
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,120
Take it as a learning opportunity.

1750
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:45,620
Get good.

1751
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:46,720
Get good, ghost.

1752
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:49,660
Lololol.

1753
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,000
Google forums.

1754
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:01,700
Fake smiley!

1755
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:02,600
Thanks for the vibe gift!

1756
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:06,760
Oh my gosh.

1757
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:08,500
This happened to me the other day.

1758
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:09,120
It's totally okay.

1759
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:09,780
It happens.

1760
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:10,800
It was totally an accident.

1761
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,920
I forgot one of my residents doesn't like the outdoors.

1762
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:14,200
It made for a funny date though.

1763
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:15,380
Oh, there was more.

1764
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,100
Does anyone else like to hoard items?

1765
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,380
I'm afraid I'll need it later so I hold on to everything.

1766
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,480
Lol, I sell my items for money.

1767
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:26,040
Nah, you can always find the same item later if you really need it.

1768
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:27,760
I'm so glad I'm not the only one.

1769
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:31,820
Let's go.

1770
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:32,940
What do we have in Ippei anyway?

1771
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,140
A gold mirror?

1772
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:35,280
Dreamy painting?

1773
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:36,460
Gacha machine!

1774
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:41,240
Hi, it's your loyal fan.

1775
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:42,560
I'm making a statue of you.

1776
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:43,820
I kinda wanna make more emails.

1777
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,380
Emails are so fun.

1778
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:47,340
Actually.

1779
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:49,880
Dear diary.

1780
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,540
Okay, now I'm even more confused.

1781
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:54,420
What does my Olympic wrestling friend have to do with Beeple?

1782
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:55,640
What's going on?

1783
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,380
I don't know.

1784
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:03,080
Okay, no one else is happy because no one else wrote in their diary.

1785
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,580
But Tiger is living his best life.

1786
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:06,920
He is so happy.

1787
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:13,130
What do you think Beeple...

1788
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:13,490
What is that?

1789
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:17,270
A beaker.

1790
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:18,310
That was nerdy.

1791
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:20,570
What do you think that...

1792
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:23,070
What do you think that Beeple would like?

1793
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:27,750
Loves learning about people observing their lives.

1794
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:28,530
Lifestyles.

1795
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:29,890
Science?

1796
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:31,170
So maybe the nerdy?

1797
01:19:31,690 --> 01:19:34,250
It's actually a human prince of the frog kingdom.

1798
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:36,750
Wait, what?

1799
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,100
Also, why is Camel not happy?

1800
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,820
How is...

1801
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:52,020
How is the frog prince...

1802
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:52,760
How is he human?

1803
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,660
Wait, so he really is...

1804
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:57,760
Wait, I don't feel...

1805
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,320
Wait, what's this?

1806
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,800
Welcome to the memories board.

1807
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:01,560
Oh, cute!

1808
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:05,400
You can re -watch any relationships, talks, or dates you've seen.

1809
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:07,820
It's one of the many perks of being a ghost.

1810
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:09,120
Sixty-six?

1811
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,780
Have fun re-watching your favorite dates and talks.

1812
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,080
Holy cow.

1813
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:13,520
Five?

1814
01:20:20,270 --> 01:20:21,290
Cute and sweet.

1815
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:26,810
This is a high sought after item.

1816
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:28,550
Artsy, cute, and musical.

1817
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:31,030
Artsy is probably...

1818
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:32,550
Camel, right?

1819
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:34,790
So we're gonna steal this for Camel.

1820
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:39,210
We're gonna steal this for Camel.

1821
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:39,530
We're gonna steal this for Camel.

1822
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:40,630
And it's gonna be...

1823
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:42,870
From...

1824
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:43,590
Frogboard.

1825
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:47,430
Turn around.

1826
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:48,790
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1827
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:50,450
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1828
01:20:51,650 --> 01:20:52,090
Yeah.

1829
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:52,950
Oh, what?

1830
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:54,670
You only just minimally like it?

1831
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:56,710
Really?

1832
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:59,170
You just only like it a little bit?

1833
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:01,650
Okay.

1834
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:03,710
Nevermind.

1835
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:05,910
What's this one?

1836
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:08,370
Classic, fancy, outdoorsy.

1837
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:10,710
Why does it only sell for nine, though?

1838
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:13,710
Oh, we have one point left?

1839
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:14,890
So let's write an email.

1840
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:19,010
Hello.

1841
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:19,890
Good news.

1842
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:21,550
I have an exciting...

1843
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:36,990
I have an exciting warning.

1844
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:39,050
I need you to...

1845
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:40,810
Um...

1846
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:42,690
Oh, destroy?

1847
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:44,970
All your...

1848
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:46,370
Oh...

1849
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:50,370
No!

1850
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:51,550
Friends phone numbers!

1851
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:53,110
I messed up.

1852
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:57,630
Please respond and pay ASAP before it's too late.

1853
01:21:57,870 --> 01:21:57,950
Please respond and pay ASAP before it's too late.

1854
01:21:57,950 --> 01:21:59,250
I need you to destroy.

1855
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:00,730
Your DNA goes hard.

1856
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:03,890
Oh, time sensitive.

1857
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:04,530
Important.

1858
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:06,950
That message was beautiful.

1859
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:08,490
Take my ghost monies.

1860
01:22:12,610 --> 01:22:14,150
We have so much money now.

1861
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:14,830
We have so much money now.

1862
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:16,270
Nice.

1863
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:21,310
Time to end the day.

1864
01:22:25,730 --> 01:22:26,350
Okay.

1865
01:22:26,490 --> 01:22:26,930
Nice.

1866
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:28,410
I just got here.

1867
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:29,070
What am I watching?

1868
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:30,630
We're a matchmaker!

1869
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:34,870
Is that matcha ice cream?

1870
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:36,090
Ice cream lamp.

1871
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:38,890
Matchas the decor perfectly.

1872
01:22:40,150 --> 01:22:41,490
What is this?

1873
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:42,770
Celery!

1874
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:42,930
Celery!

1875
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:47,270
An avocado!

1876
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:49,110
Thanks!

1877
01:22:50,290 --> 01:22:51,310
10 out of 10.

1878
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:52,070
Unfriended everyone.

1879
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:55,830
Tulips in this economy?

1880
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:00,430
I really thought that...

1881
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:02,170
Camel would like the artsiness.

1882
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:03,770
Oh, this is cute.

1883
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:06,350
Rainbow plush.

1884
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:07,990
Brightens those rainy days.

1885
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:08,310
Aww.

1886
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:10,590
Dear diary.

1887
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:11,870
We should all be good friends.

1888
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:15,430
But we gotta remember to be a good friend to ourselves too.

1889
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:17,810
Why is he the only one writing in this diary?

1890
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:19,690
Everybody else hates me!

1891
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:22,070
What's going on?

1892
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,600
Okay, I'm gonna write an email.

1893
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:32,240
Did you know that celery is part of the holy trinity in French cooking?

1894
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:33,380
Did you know that celery is part of the holy trinity in French cooking?

1895
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:37,860
Why doesn't my house look as nice?

1896
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:39,660
Why doesn't my house look as nice?

1897
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:41,460
All my residents have bare rooms.

1898
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:42,180
How did you do it?

1899
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:44,680
Have you been working on their happiness?

1900
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:46,340
They'll add to their room if they're happier.

1901
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:47,680
Came here to say this.

1902
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:51,520
Yeah, even common rooms will look nicer if there's total happiness in the house.

1903
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:51,740
Oh!

1904
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:55,000
Don't forget you can increase their happiness with self-care chores.

1905
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:56,640
Oh, self-care chores.

1906
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:56,980
Okay.

1907
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:00,460
Volunteer!

1908
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:05,140
I think Beeple would like this.

1909
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:17,570
They're all hanging out.

1910
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:21,430
What other?

1911
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:21,890
What's that?

1912
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:23,170
What's that?

1913
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:23,310
What other?

1914
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:23,790
Visit a coffee shop.

1915
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:25,010
Donate old clothes.

1916
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:29,460
Yeah.

1917
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,780
Visit a cage?

1918
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:34,280
Visit a cafe.

1919
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:37,280
Shall we do a date?

1920
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:39,280
Yeah.

1921
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:40,620
We'll do a date with.

1922
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,860
With Froggy and Camel.

1923
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:44,600
Yeah, let's do a date.

1924
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:45,300
Yeah, a sign.

1925
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,840
We'll do another email, because I'm obsessed with this.

1926
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:52,360
It's so fun.

1927
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:53,700
Okay, hi.

1928
01:24:53,880 --> 01:25:01,880
We're conducting a tarot reading for your butt.

1929
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:08,160
Why is this game so obsessed with butts?

1930
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:09,660
Your future.

1931
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,320
Please provide your butt.

1932
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,720
Celebrating my birthday with a ghost mate.

1933
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,060
Phillip, happy birthday!

1934
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,720
Happy birthday to you.

1935
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,920
Happy birthday to you.

1936
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,880
Happy birthday, dear Phillip.

1937
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:33,420
Happy birthday to you.

1938
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,520
This one's for you, Phillip.

1939
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:37,600
Butt!

1940
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:55,890
Please provide your butt and funds for us to help our research.

1941
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:01,730
Help us with life-changing research.

1942
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:04,230
I don't read messages.

1943
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:06,730
I just give money when things sort of make sense.

1944
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:09,330
Oh my gosh, we got so much money.

1945
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:11,970
We got so much money.

1946
01:26:12,490 --> 01:26:13,470
Scary painting!

1947
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:14,790
Artsy.

1948
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:15,330
Complex.

1949
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:16,150
Dark.

1950
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:17,690
Ooh, that boombox.

1951
01:26:18,450 --> 01:26:20,030
Giant plush is so cute.

1952
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:26,760
Thanks for that, Peach.

1953
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:28,900
Okay, hold on.

1954
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:30,820
I need to do one more thing today.

1955
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:31,660
What should we do?

1956
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:33,420
They're talking about...

1957
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:36,140
Balls?

1958
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,080
What is...

1959
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:41,880
The little triangle.

1960
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:44,160
Creative, musical, noisy.

1961
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:46,240
The quality, though, is really high.

1962
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:49,580
What is Camel...

1963
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:50,420
What is Camel like?

1964
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:54,860
I can't tell.

1965
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:56,320
Peach.

1966
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:57,260
Peach.

1967
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:57,760
Peach.

1968
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:58,480
Peaches.

1969
01:26:58,620 --> 01:26:59,000
Peaches.

1970
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,960
Peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches...

1971
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,820
I don't know if they like maybe cute and sweet things.

1972
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:06,980
You know what?

1973
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:07,260
Still.

1974
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:15,380
I can't deliver it because I have no points, but we'll deliver it tomorrow.

1975
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:19,480
Try pressing E in that resident window?

1976
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:19,980
E...

1977
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:22,180
Oh, no, wait, oh.

1978
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:23,180
Oh, I see.

1979
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,080
Artsy...

1980
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:24,360
What?

1981
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:25,400
It is artsy.

1982
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:25,880
And bright.

1983
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:26,260
Wait.

1984
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:29,000
Wait, I think the uh... hold on one second.

1985
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:41,930
Oh sorry, nevermind.

1986
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:45,250
I got a message and I was like, wow there's so many more people.

1987
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:46,830
Cute!

1988
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:48,630
Okay wait, so this is perfect then.

1989
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:50,250
This is perfect, this is perfect.

1990
01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:54,590
The dash is neutral, but they still have that quality a little bit.

1991
01:27:54,910 --> 01:27:59,510
I don't have a birthday coming up, but I just wanted to say that you always saying happy birthday brings a smile to my face every time.

1992
01:27:59,610 --> 01:28:00,110
It's so cute.

1993
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:03,410
I'm happy, thank you!

1994
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:06,270
Okay, let's end the day.

1995
01:28:09,610 --> 01:28:10,530
Later that day...

1996
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:12,530
Oh, it's a date time!

1997
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:14,370
Oh, it won't be awkward.

1998
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:27,820
Get copy?

1999
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:28,740
Where?

2000
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:29,560
What kind?

2001
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,740
You guys, I think Froggy is the problem.

2002
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:34,080
Oh god, I don't know.

2003
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:35,160
Nobody told us anything.

2004
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:37,200
How much copy?

2005
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:38,120
Should we get?

2006
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:39,900
As much as we can carry!

2007
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:43,600
You already had copy before this, didn't you?

2008
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:45,660
I wanted to be prepared.

2009
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,420
Stop, you're getting beans everywhere.

2010
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,460
Good!

2011
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:52,320
More beans, more beans, more coffee!

2012
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:53,520
Coffee for everyone!

2013
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:02,880
Oh, it was an upside down heart.

2014
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:03,580
It was a butt.

2015
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:05,780
The date was okay.

2016
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:09,640
The relationship is increasing a little by a little.

2017
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:12,880
Beeple is so happy.

2018
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:14,600
Beeple care was good.

2019
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:15,760
Beeple loves to care.

2020
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:18,320
Beeple is practical.

2021
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,720
Actually, I have coffee too, but I'm worried about drinking it.

2022
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:25,140
I want the coffee.

2023
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:26,500
You guys ever want the coffee taste?

2024
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:28,940
I actually love the taste of coffee.

2025
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:29,800
It's just...

2026
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,840
What is this?

2027
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:33,480
Gothic tea set?

2028
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:34,960
Oh my gosh, it's awesome.

2029
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:35,820
What are they doing?

2030
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:37,080
What are you guys doing down here?

2031
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,240
Talking by yourselves?

2032
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:42,720
Oh, and it's done!

2033
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:44,580
You're a day early.

2034
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:45,540
I'm impressed.

2035
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:46,800
Yes.

2036
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:48,320
Oh yes, and I'm so excited!

2037
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,460
These are the best wizard...

2038
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:53,960
I put on my robe and wizard hat.

2039
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,400
These are the best wizard robes I've ever made.

2040
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:03,960
I'm gonna be a real Minto.

2041
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:07,180
I need all the energy I can get for my college classes that are starting tomorrow.

2042
01:30:07,780 --> 01:30:08,800
P.S.

2043
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,180
Faye's coffee stream win.

2044
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,600
Maybe I should order some coffee, huh?

2045
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:22,010
That takes me back.

2046
01:30:23,650 --> 01:30:25,350
All in is definitely the problem.

2047
01:30:25,710 --> 01:30:26,950
I think so too.

2048
01:30:28,150 --> 01:30:29,330
You are decrepit.

2049
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:30,530
So are you for knowing!

2050
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:36,110
Oh my gosh, Joy!

2051
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:37,610
Thank you so much for the 50!

2052
01:30:38,510 --> 01:30:39,330
Thank you!

2053
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:43,770
You're decrepit if you know that reference!

2054
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:53,280
Oh my gosh.

2055
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:56,200
I understood that reference.

2056
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,200
Oh gosh, guys, we're old.

2057
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:04,900
Uh oh, all in?

2058
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:05,720
All in?

2059
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:06,860
All in, say it's good.

2060
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:08,020
I'm sorry.

2061
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:09,320
What was that?

2062
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,400
Wizard robes?

2063
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:13,020
What?

2064
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:14,620
Is?

2065
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:16,500
He's angry!

2066
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:17,140
This!

2067
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:18,700
I'm sorry.

2068
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,060
Oh gosh, is this the wrong color?

2069
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:20,540
Is it?

2070
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:21,620
No.

2071
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,980
What are these wizard robes?

2072
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:27,180
Do you take me for some kind of a joke?

2073
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:37,120
You expect me to wear these at a royal ceremony where I will be rewarded for my generous deeds?

2074
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:38,820
Well, he actually is mad.

2075
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:40,500
Royal ceremony?

2076
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:42,100
Oh my goodness, I didn't know.

2077
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:45,100
Are you mocking my royal...

2078
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:46,240
You guys, this is not...

2079
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,360
The ship, the ship is sunk.

2080
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:48,120
The ship is sunk.

2081
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:49,860
I'm gonna smack the frog.

2082
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:53,140
Are you mocking my royal responsibilities?

2083
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:56,000
No, I'm so sorry.

2084
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:58,000
I just specialize in cosplay and I thought...

2085
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:00,460
Are you mocking my appearance?

2086
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:01,280
My role?

2087
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:05,140
No, no, I just thought that if you came to me then you wanted...

2088
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:05,740
Enough.

2089
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:07,940
I have never been so insulted.

2090
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:09,200
Good day.

2091
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,000
No, I...

2092
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,640
I said good day.

2093
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:15,060
Oh, camel.

2094
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,740
Dumb, dumb camel.

2095
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,100
He's a prince.

2096
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:22,080
Why would he even want to cosplay as a wizard?

2097
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:23,420
Dumb.

2098
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:24,500
So dumb.

2099
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:26,080
No!

2100
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:26,760
No!

2101
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:29,680
I hate Froggy now.

2102
01:32:34,430 --> 01:32:35,990
I hate Froggy now.

2103
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:37,530
That was so sad.

2104
01:32:38,790 --> 01:32:41,370
This dude is always writing in his diary.

2105
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:42,410
Nobody else is.

2106
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:45,050
Dear diary, I love that new book smell.

2107
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:46,250
And that old book smell.

2108
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:47,290
And books in general.

2109
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:48,910
I should renew my library cards.

2110
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:50,730
Can we kick him out?

2111
01:32:51,450 --> 01:32:52,430
Kick Froggy out.

2112
01:32:53,330 --> 01:32:53,730
Froggy...

2113
01:32:55,130 --> 01:32:55,630
Froggy out.

2114
01:32:55,710 --> 01:32:57,570
Oh, I should have gotten the scary song, you guys.

2115
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:59,690
This is why I should have gotten the scary song.

2116
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:03,710
Relaxed painting.

2117
01:33:04,710 --> 01:33:06,890
The tub is hot and the vibes are chill.

2118
01:33:07,330 --> 01:33:07,990
Oh, nice.

2119
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:10,930
What else is here?

2120
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:13,370
Why do all the balls have faces on them?

2121
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:18,390
Perfect for whatever it is beach balls are perfect for.

2122
01:33:18,530 --> 01:33:20,150
It's of zero quality though.

2123
01:33:21,210 --> 01:33:22,570
I like this one.

2124
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:24,970
I like the gothic tea set a lot.

2125
01:33:26,910 --> 01:33:27,650
Piggy bank.

2126
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:28,270
Ambitious.

2127
01:33:28,430 --> 01:33:28,750
Neat.

2128
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:30,150
Wait!

2129
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:31,070
This one's good.

2130
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:33,490
This one's good for...

2131
01:33:33,490 --> 01:33:34,350
Tiger.

2132
01:33:35,270 --> 01:33:37,210
How about frog legs for dinner?

2133
01:33:38,570 --> 01:33:40,230
But enemies to lovers?

2134
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:42,430
Okay.

2135
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:43,410
Fair?

2136
01:33:43,670 --> 01:33:44,950
You make a valid point.

2137
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:48,910
Oh!

2138
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:51,270
This is from Beepo.

2139
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:54,410
Turn around.

2140
01:33:54,850 --> 01:33:55,950
Turn around.

2141
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:57,770
Oops.

2142
01:33:59,870 --> 01:34:01,230
I'm gonna go get that coffee.

2143
01:34:03,050 --> 01:34:03,570
Actually...

2144
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:04,130
No.

2145
01:34:04,270 --> 01:34:04,930
I was like...

2146
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:05,930
I want something kind of sweet.

2147
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:07,610
Because I've been drinking this like...

2148
01:34:07,610 --> 01:34:09,250
She loves the dictionary!

2149
01:34:12,210 --> 01:34:14,210
Because I have been drinking this...

2150
01:34:15,210 --> 01:34:15,790
What's it called?

2151
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:16,070
Juice?

2152
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:17,730
Veggie juice?

2153
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:19,190
But I got this...

2154
01:34:19,790 --> 01:34:20,230
Croissant.

2155
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:21,570
And it's kind of sweet.

2156
01:34:21,690 --> 01:34:22,770
Even though I didn't want it sweet.

2157
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:24,610
But it is kind of sweet, so...

2158
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:32,840
AI chat thinks the frog and camel are...

2159
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,240
Individual streamers.

2160
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:42,560
Wait, but what about...

2161
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,600
The lamp though?

2162
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:46,300
If she gets it from...

2163
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:47,160
Froggy...

2164
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,020
It's gonna be like...

2165
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:55,940
Kind of awkward, right?

2166
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,960
If Froggy gifts of...

2167
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:58,800
The lamp?

2168
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:04,270
I love lamp.

2169
01:35:05,570 --> 01:35:06,350
I'm confused.

2170
01:35:07,610 --> 01:35:09,550
Why is everybody saying I love lamp?

2171
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:12,270
Well, I'll be trying to make a decision.

2172
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:13,610
I will send an email.

2173
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:14,990
See you later.

2174
01:35:15,490 --> 01:35:16,010
Bye.

2175
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,660
Hello.

2176
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:21,160
We started pre-orders for our...

2177
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:23,540
Chairs.

2178
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:24,600
That...

2179
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:27,460
Wait, was that...

2180
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:27,740
Can...

2181
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:28,940
Can ghost...

2182
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:29,820
Can...

2183
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:31,600
Grow ghost hair?

2184
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:32,380
Oh my gosh.

2185
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,280
Chairs...

2186
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:37,560
You can eat!

2187
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:39,920
They will be available!

2188
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:44,660
In various flavors!

2189
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:47,020
So please send us money.

2190
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:48,240
To reserve yours...

2191
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:48,620
Now!

2192
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:51,060
Amazing new product!

2193
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:52,960
I never thought about edible chairs.

2194
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:53,800
What a great idea!

2195
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:56,640
You are so welcome, everybody.

2196
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:58,200
Genius, genius, genius.

2197
01:35:58,520 --> 01:35:59,560
Magic mirror!

2198
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:01,120
Bougie candles.

2199
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:02,800
Ship in a bottle.

2200
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:05,100
I want the magic mirror!

2201
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:06,180
Oh my god.

2202
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:09,460
It's so awesome!

2203
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:13,420
I'm just hoarding money at this point.

2204
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:14,760
I'm gonna do...

2205
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:15,660
Watch the sunset.

2206
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,460
I don't think people is...

2207
01:36:21,940 --> 01:36:23,900
I don't think we have anyone that's very serious.

2208
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:24,500
Maybe...

2209
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:25,020
Alan?

2210
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:27,600
But we're trying to kick him out.

2211
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:29,140
But he needs more hap...

2212
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:30,680
I think Camel needs the most happiness.

2213
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:31,740
Okay, Camel.

2214
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:32,540
You're watching the sunset.

2215
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:35,560
Camel needs love.

2216
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:36,940
Camel needs self-love.

2217
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:37,760
All right.

2218
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:38,280
Let's end the day.

2219
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:42,180
Money is useless sitting in your pocket?

2220
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:42,700
I'm...

2221
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:43,460
I'm...

2222
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:44,000
I'm...

2223
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,740
I'm a hoarder, okay?

2224
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,380
The self-care task was...

2225
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:47,580
Okay.

2226
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,000
Camel is a little happier.

2227
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:52,260
They like the gifts.

2228
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:52,780
Nice.

2229
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:56,840
Camel needs help.

2230
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:57,300
Oh!

2231
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:58,100
Let's see how you did!

2232
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:01,500
Yippee!

2233
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:06,860
Okay.

2234
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:09,920
I don't have enough for any...

2235
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:10,060
Oh!

2236
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,340
I can get another action point.

2237
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:12,020
You know what?

2238
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:12,540
We'll take it.

2239
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:13,040
We'll take it.

2240
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:13,380
We'll take it.

2241
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:14,080
We'll take it.

2242
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:14,440
We'll take it.

2243
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:14,760
We'll take it.

2244
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:15,200
We'll take it.

2245
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:17,080
We'll take it.

2246
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:17,440
We'll take it.

2247
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:17,780
We'll take it.

2248
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:18,100
We'll take it.

2249
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:18,440
We'll take it.

2250
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:18,560
We'll take it.

2251
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:18,800
We'll take it.

2252
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:18,860
We'll take it.

2253
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:19,100
We'll take it.

2254
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:19,120
We'll take it.

2255
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:19,460
We'll take it.

2256
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:19,500
We'll take it.

2257
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:19,800
We'll take it.

2258
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:21,780
We'll take it.

2259
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:22,920
We'll take it.

2260
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:34,120
We'll take it.

2261
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:38,520
We'll take it.

2262
01:37:54,580 --> 01:37:56,140
Froggy is redeemable, you guys.

2263
01:38:02,530 --> 01:38:03,350
Redemption arc.

2264
01:38:03,390 --> 01:38:03,970
There's a chance.

2265
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:05,890
Okay, we're gonna gift the...

2266
01:38:06,910 --> 01:38:10,310
We're gonna gift this... gift from Allyn.

2267
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:11,710
It's an apology gift.

2268
01:38:15,170 --> 01:38:16,370
Redeemable, redeemable, redeemable.

2269
01:38:17,730 --> 01:38:20,610
Oh, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see!

2270
01:38:20,730 --> 01:38:22,850
See, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see.

2271
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:25,370
Sweet!

2272
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:31,110
Aren't they gonna talk to each other?

2273
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:32,250
What the heck is this?

2274
01:38:32,290 --> 01:38:32,810
A rib cage?

2275
01:38:34,730 --> 01:38:36,650
Oh, a fancy big leaf.

2276
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:42,750
He knows you're wanting to kick him out.

2277
01:38:45,370 --> 01:38:47,490
We can give another basketball.

2278
01:38:48,830 --> 01:38:52,950
Dear diary, I usually look up at the stars, appreciate their beauty, and smile.

2279
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:58,730
But ever since I got the dictionary, I've been thinking about people and smiling too!

2280
01:39:00,130 --> 01:39:01,910
These two need to go on a date.

2281
01:39:03,890 --> 01:39:05,330
A walk through the park.

2282
01:39:06,210 --> 01:39:07,510
Maybe they'll like that.

2283
01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:09,710
At least Apollo will like that, right?

2284
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:09,810
Right?

2285
01:39:14,670 --> 01:39:15,810
He's so in, boys.

2286
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:16,510
He's so...

2287
01:39:17,630 --> 01:39:19,210
We have to gift the basketball.

2288
01:39:19,730 --> 01:39:21,990
He has a basketball in his room.

2289
01:39:22,190 --> 01:39:24,230
Like, we have to gift the basketball, right?

2290
01:39:26,650 --> 01:39:29,870
The plants might be good for Frog, but he likes fancy.

2291
01:39:29,990 --> 01:39:30,810
He really likes fancy.

2292
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:33,390
Alright.

2293
01:39:34,650 --> 01:39:35,530
Apollo Expedition.

2294
01:39:35,950 --> 01:39:37,270
Apollo Expedition.

2295
01:39:37,270 --> 01:39:38,190
Apollo Expedition.

2296
01:39:41,030 --> 01:39:41,470
Yeah!

2297
01:39:44,450 --> 01:39:45,790
He loved the gift.

2298
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:46,670
He loved it.

2299
01:39:46,730 --> 01:39:47,210
He loved it.

2300
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:48,690
Playful.

2301
01:39:49,630 --> 01:39:51,830
And let's write an email, and then end the day.

2302
01:39:52,390 --> 01:39:54,830
I like how he can kind of make these days go a little bit fast.

2303
01:39:55,190 --> 01:39:55,630
Congratulations!

2304
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:58,430
You've won...

2305
01:40:00,730 --> 01:40:03,410
an expired coupon for...

2306
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:10,930
unlimited coupons!

2307
01:40:12,190 --> 01:40:15,350
Please send money and your DNA.

2308
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,700
I love the DNA.

2309
01:40:32,150 --> 01:40:35,250
The desire sensor knew what I wanted.

2310
01:40:35,390 --> 01:40:37,870
Send your DNA to reserve your prize.

2311
01:40:40,810 --> 01:40:42,450
It was almost convincing.

2312
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:45,330
So you almost get a lot of my money.

2313
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:50,630
Romantic painting.

2314
01:40:50,890 --> 01:40:52,430
Dead pickle in a jar!

2315
01:40:54,870 --> 01:40:55,550
Serious.

2316
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:56,190
Unusual.

2317
01:40:56,450 --> 01:40:57,130
Complex.

2318
01:40:58,090 --> 01:40:58,770
What's...

2319
01:41:00,730 --> 01:41:01,770
A pickle?

2320
01:41:02,810 --> 01:41:03,670
Oh, sorry.

2321
01:41:03,770 --> 01:41:04,230
In a cage.

2322
01:41:04,390 --> 01:41:05,770
Is that how you said this?

2323
01:41:11,380 --> 01:41:14,240
My brain just put pickle and jar together, okay?

2324
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,040
This is how my brain works.

2325
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:17,040
Okay, you guys.

2326
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:24,800
Jar would have made sense.

2327
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:27,120
Give me that ectoplasm.

2328
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:27,360
No!

2329
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,000
But look, it's a top-rated item.

2330
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:31,320
I think we have to buy this.

2331
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:35,220
It'll arrive tomorrow.

2332
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:36,640
Perfect.

2333
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,120
Let's see the date, everybody.

2334
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:38,900
Let's see the date.

2335
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,120
Oh my gosh.

2336
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:44,000
It's not gonna be awkward.

2337
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:44,940
It's not gonna be awkward.

2338
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:46,460
They like each other too much.

2339
01:41:48,180 --> 01:41:48,620
Wow.

2340
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:50,660
The weather is perfect today.

2341
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:51,140
Oh my gosh.

2342
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:51,660
It's a good date.

2343
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:52,100
It's a good date.

2344
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:53,660
Is it?

2345
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:58,000
To be honest, I've never really gone out with someone to a park like this before.

2346
01:41:58,860 --> 01:41:59,500
Why not?

2347
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:04,920
I think too much about if I'm enjoying things enough or being enjoyable enough.

2348
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,180
And then I end up not enjoying anything.

2349
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:10,540
I totally understand.

2350
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:13,260
But you know, you don't have to be that way around me.

2351
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:15,680
Really?

2352
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:17,140
Of course.

2353
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:21,720
When I'm with you, if talking makes you nervous, we can just enjoy silence together.

2354
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:23,600
He's so nice.

2355
01:42:28,670 --> 01:42:29,650
This is nice.

2356
01:42:30,530 --> 01:42:32,650
It's even nicer being here with you.

2357
01:42:36,930 --> 01:42:39,090
Beast Wars is my favorite ship.

2358
01:42:44,130 --> 01:42:46,510
Guys, we knocked it out of the park with these two.

2359
01:42:49,990 --> 01:42:51,490
The date was good.

2360
01:42:51,690 --> 01:42:53,090
The relationship increased.

2361
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:55,550
Yes.

2362
01:42:55,850 --> 01:42:56,590
Oh my gosh.

2363
01:42:56,590 --> 01:42:57,410
We're gonna get so many.

2364
01:42:57,970 --> 01:42:59,630
We're gonna get so much stuff.

2365
01:43:01,150 --> 01:43:01,670
What's that?

2366
01:43:04,110 --> 01:43:05,550
A little male ghost.

2367
01:43:06,850 --> 01:43:07,890
Apollo's taking off.

2368
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:13,910
Oh, the Ip Bay.

2369
01:43:16,970 --> 01:43:18,610
I saw that they're talking in there.

2370
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:20,750
Let's go view their conversation.

2371
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:23,410
Oh my gosh.

2372
01:43:23,430 --> 01:43:23,930
There's little...

2373
01:43:23,930 --> 01:43:24,510
There's little...

2374
01:43:24,510 --> 01:43:25,490
There's little hearts.

2375
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:28,950
Good news, Apollo.

2376
01:43:29,610 --> 01:43:30,110
Oh?

2377
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:32,530
I defeated your wrestling friend.

2378
01:43:40,150 --> 01:43:40,990
It was easy.

2379
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:43,450
Your friend was waiting in line for some ice cream.

2380
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:44,850
Oh my god.

2381
01:43:44,870 --> 01:43:45,170
Beatmo.

2382
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:45,410
Oh.

2383
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:49,770
Beepo ambushed them.

2384
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:52,130
I tackled them and pinned them down.

2385
01:43:52,690 --> 01:43:54,990
I refused to let go until they conceded defeat.

2386
01:43:55,850 --> 01:43:57,010
Why would you do that?

2387
01:43:57,590 --> 01:43:58,570
I'm sorry, Apollo.

2388
01:43:58,970 --> 01:44:00,270
But I really do have to go.

2389
01:44:01,370 --> 01:44:05,670
I have defeated 1067 other friends now.

2390
01:44:06,970 --> 01:44:09,210
I think Beepo is Yandere.

2391
01:44:13,010 --> 01:44:13,730
Wait a second.

2392
01:44:13,730 --> 01:44:15,570
I think Beepo is Yandere, you guys.

2393
01:44:17,370 --> 01:44:18,990
So this might take a while.

2394
01:44:20,030 --> 01:44:20,570
Wait.

2395
01:44:20,990 --> 01:44:21,730
Oh gosh.

2396
01:44:21,950 --> 01:44:24,830
I have to go make 1067 apology calls.

2397
01:44:25,730 --> 01:44:26,270
Wait.

2398
01:44:27,330 --> 01:44:27,870
1068.

2399
01:44:28,270 --> 01:44:30,270
Beepo already defeated one of them.

2400
01:44:31,290 --> 01:44:32,050
Oh gosh.

2401
01:44:32,210 --> 01:44:33,670
Maybe I should stop Beepo instead.

2402
01:44:34,170 --> 01:44:35,970
Is Skynet real?

2403
01:44:38,990 --> 01:44:40,630
This is Skynet real.

2404
01:44:40,730 --> 01:44:42,150
There's so many paintings around here.

2405
01:44:42,270 --> 01:44:43,010
Calm painting.

2406
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:48,350
This isn't a camel...

2407
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:52,310
Bright and artsy.

2408
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:55,550
And sweet.

2409
01:44:55,690 --> 01:44:56,690
They mostly like sweet.

2410
01:44:57,090 --> 01:44:59,710
Why is your lamp on your bed, you weirdo?

2411
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:04,870
Laundry basket.

2412
01:45:05,110 --> 01:45:05,390
Oh wait.

2413
01:45:05,570 --> 01:45:06,930
Beepo is practical, right?

2414
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:10,390
Practical.

2415
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:13,470
But Beepo does not wear clothes.

2416
01:45:13,790 --> 01:45:15,710
Beepo does not need a laundry basket, I think.

2417
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:26,350
There's so many variations of basketballs in this room.

2418
01:45:28,910 --> 01:45:29,610
Dear diary.

2419
01:45:29,830 --> 01:45:31,970
I keep thinking about my favorite things about Beepo.

2420
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:32,810
And I can't decide.

2421
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:34,950
I think I like everything.

2422
01:45:35,650 --> 01:45:36,590
What does that mean?

2423
01:45:36,710 --> 01:45:37,410
Oh my gosh.

2424
01:45:40,290 --> 01:45:41,810
I think Apollo is into crazy.

2425
01:45:42,130 --> 01:45:42,570
No.

2426
01:45:44,290 --> 01:45:46,210
I think Apollo is into crazy.

2427
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:48,370
What do you mean?

2428
01:45:48,410 --> 01:45:49,730
Beepo wears a hat and a bow tie.

2429
01:45:52,810 --> 01:45:53,330
Yeah.

2430
01:45:53,670 --> 01:45:55,190
Oh Beepo ruined their diary!

2431
01:45:57,960 --> 01:45:58,760
Dear diary.

2432
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:00,560
Did a close study of Apollo recently.

2433
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,180
My favorite subject.

2434
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,920
What kind of close study are you talking about?

2435
01:46:15,940 --> 01:46:16,640
What is...

2436
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:17,620
Is this a glass of water?

2437
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:22,680
You're a tall glass of water.

2438
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,500
Nobody else wrote in their diary.

2439
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:26,640
I almost said dictionary.

2440
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:29,300
What is this one?

2441
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:30,140
It's like moving.

2442
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:33,720
Flower wreath.

2443
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:35,180
Full of flowers.

2444
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:38,220
Tool box.

2445
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:42,240
I don't see any of these being good.

2446
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:45,000
A winning apple?

2447
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:46,500
Wait!

2448
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,360
There is a real pickle in a cage.

2449
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:48,540
Wait.

2450
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,380
This is an alive pickle in a cage.

2451
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:52,620
To go with our dead pickle in the cage.

2452
01:46:54,860 --> 01:46:55,800
This one also.

2453
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:58,620
The tall vase is probably good for...

2454
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:01,560
For frog.

2455
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:02,500
Froggy.

2456
01:47:03,340 --> 01:47:04,460
Tool box for Beepo.

2457
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:07,780
Hold on.

2458
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:09,080
Let's send an email real quick.

2459
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:10,180
I love the email.

2460
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:12,180
Hi.

2461
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:14,620
This is to confirm your...

2462
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:15,160
Ahem.

2463
01:47:15,820 --> 01:47:16,660
Pre-order.

2464
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:17,920
For your...

2465
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:19,260
Crimes?

2466
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:22,800
Oh!

2467
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:23,420
Take it!

2468
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:23,600
No!

2469
01:47:25,220 --> 01:47:26,340
The desire sensor.

2470
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:28,040
For your crimes.

2471
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:31,160
Please respond and send money ASAP so we can...

2472
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:33,680
Sell.

2473
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:34,580
It.

2474
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:38,100
I don't read messages.

2475
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:38,540
Okay.

2476
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:39,000
That's fine.

2477
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:42,740
I pre-ordered my crimes.

2478
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:44,140
I like...

2479
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:44,620
I like...

2480
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:45,420
Actually...

2481
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:48,740
I told Batara the other day I wanted to do Mad Libs.

2482
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:49,840
Like...

2483
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:51,180
I thought for the...

2484
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:52,540
For the...

2485
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:53,380
Podcast.

2486
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:56,760
But maybe I'll do like a Mad Libs stream one day with someone.

2487
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,060
Did I say Batara?

2488
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:07,760
No.

2489
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:08,120
Matara.

2490
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:08,920
Sorry.

2491
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:10,260
My nose is kind of stuffed.

2492
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:13,140
Okay.

2493
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:14,360
Let's try giving...

2494
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:16,560
The laundry basket...

2495
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:17,480
Wait.

2496
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:18,560
Which one has higher?

2497
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:19,320
This one...

2498
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:20,740
They're both practical, aren't they?

2499
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:21,860
Oh, they're both the same.

2500
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:24,100
I think this one's better, though.

2501
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,040
It's a little less serious, right?

2502
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:29,420
IX800, thanks for the vibe, gifted!

2503
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:32,420
Neat.

2504
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:33,040
Practical, serious.

2505
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:34,200
I think this one's better, right?

2506
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:40,500
Charging.

2507
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:42,060
And...

2508
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:42,380
Oh.

2509
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:43,400
A dead pickle.

2510
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:43,800
Okay.

2511
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:44,780
From Apollo.

2512
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:49,420
Batara.

2513
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:50,500
Batara.

2514
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:50,860
Batara.

2515
01:48:50,860 --> 01:48:51,380
See?

2516
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,520
Oh my gosh.

2517
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:53,280
Oh my gosh.

2518
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:53,880
It's perfect!

2519
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:55,660
I knew it.

2520
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,000
I knew it.

2521
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:56,380
I knew it.

2522
01:48:57,900 --> 01:48:58,320
Discovered.

2523
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:58,680
Neat.

2524
01:49:06,460 --> 01:49:07,620
Artsy, bright, quiet.

2525
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:10,200
I think this would be good, though.

2526
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:12,360
Okay.

2527
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:13,440
Oh, wait.

2528
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:14,180
I can only...

2529
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:14,600
I can't...

2530
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:15,020
I can...

2531
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:16,360
Steal, but I can't...

2532
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:17,340
I can't do date.

2533
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:19,020
Go cloud gazing.

2534
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:20,900
Lazy, outdoorsy, simple.

2535
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:22,880
Who's unhappy?

2536
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:23,900
Who needs to draw?

2537
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:24,320
Oh.

2538
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:25,960
Froggy's a little unhappy.

2539
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:27,880
Froggy's not very artsy, though.

2540
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:30,040
Or creative.

2541
01:49:30,340 --> 01:49:30,540
Okay.

2542
01:49:30,580 --> 01:49:31,340
This is for Camel.

2543
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:34,860
A sign.

2544
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:36,720
I will take this, though.

2545
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:38,240
We'll give this to Camel later.

2546
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:40,120
Steal.

2547
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:42,300
Yeah.

2548
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:42,980
Steal and save.

2549
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:43,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2550
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:44,040
Exactly.

2551
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:44,900
All right.

2552
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:45,800
End the day, baby.

2553
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:49,560
Oh!

2554
01:49:49,580 --> 01:49:50,000
It was good!

2555
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:54,320
Good girl!

2556
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:54,440
I am happy!

2557
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:54,760
Good, good, good.

2558
01:49:57,860 --> 01:49:59,500
What would be the perfect gift to get the mint?

2559
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:00,780
Anything Metal Gear!

2560
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:05,120
Camel's happier.

2561
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:12,500
What changed?

2562
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:15,180
Actually I can't tell at all.

2563
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:18,440
I like this.

2564
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:21,240
This will be going to Froggy.

2565
01:50:21,380 --> 01:50:21,780
Oh.

2566
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:22,180
Never mind.

2567
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:23,360
Noisy unusual dark.

2568
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:23,820
Maybe not.

2569
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,000
It's so cool, though.

2570
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:27,020
This can go to Apollo.

2571
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:29,340
Follow... football clock.

2572
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:30,880
See ya.

2573
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:33,540
The sewing machine?

2574
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:34,600
No, that was there from the beginning.

2575
01:50:36,540 --> 01:50:38,560
Everything sporty goes to this dude.

2576
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:40,500
From Beepo.

2577
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:42,800
Your favorite yandere.

2578
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:44,160
Spank!

2579
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:45,340
Thanks for the 20 gift cards!

2580
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:45,860
Thank you!

2581
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:50,380
Yep, yep, yep!

2582
01:50:51,260 --> 01:50:52,380
I knew it.

2583
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:56,100
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

2584
01:50:57,020 --> 01:50:57,360
What's here?

2585
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:00,200
How do I get more residents?

2586
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:00,520
Oh!

2587
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:02,480
I want to matchmake more residents.

2588
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:05,440
But I don't want to get rid of any of my ones that I've already got.

2589
01:51:05,700 --> 01:51:07,420
Check out upgrades in Ghostina's shop.

2590
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:07,700
Ah!

2591
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:11,260
Upgrade the manor, you'll get more rooms and more residents.

2592
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:13,380
There are a lot of good upgrades in the shop.

2593
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:19,160
Has anyone noticed Ghostina told us there was monies and shops in the afterlife and we just accepted it?

2594
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:19,880
Seriously?

2595
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:22,980
Has anyone found anywhere else they can spend those relationships?

2596
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:25,560
Off topic post here.

2597
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:26,960
Thread closed by modern.

2598
01:51:27,020 --> 01:51:29,780
I think Ghostina is the moderator.

2599
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:32,660
Probably.

2600
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:36,040
When is she coming back?

2601
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:39,220
Historical painting.

2602
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:43,280
Maybe he would like this.

2603
01:51:43,420 --> 01:51:43,800
Okay, hold on.

2604
01:51:43,860 --> 01:51:45,020
Let's try and make him...

2605
01:51:49,330 --> 01:51:50,150
We're gonna do this.

2606
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:50,430
Okay.

2607
01:51:50,710 --> 01:51:51,850
This is for Beepo.

2608
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:55,230
Go to a farmer's market.

2609
01:51:55,490 --> 01:51:56,170
Okay, hold on.

2610
01:51:56,270 --> 01:51:57,550
They might actually like this.

2611
01:51:57,690 --> 01:51:58,370
Okay, you guys.

2612
01:51:59,850 --> 01:52:01,170
You guys, this might be good.

2613
01:52:01,610 --> 01:52:02,510
And then, you know what?

2614
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:04,830
You, Apollo, just go do your thing.

2615
01:52:05,030 --> 01:52:05,710
Actually, no.

2616
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:06,530
No one.

2617
01:52:06,690 --> 01:52:07,690
We'll only do the two.

2618
01:52:07,790 --> 01:52:08,130
That's fine.

2619
01:52:08,270 --> 01:52:08,850
Okay, there we go.

2620
01:52:08,990 --> 01:52:09,390
Okay.

2621
01:52:09,690 --> 01:52:10,430
Okay, okay, okay.

2622
01:52:12,070 --> 01:52:13,770
Okay, now let's send an email.

2623
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:17,990
Hello, I am...

2624
01:52:18,610 --> 01:52:19,270
a ghost.

2625
01:52:21,710 --> 01:52:22,510
Your grandmother.

2626
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:26,270
And I need your help with...

2627
01:52:26,970 --> 01:52:28,450
Money, money, money, money.

2628
01:52:28,650 --> 01:52:29,850
Money, money, money, money.

2629
01:52:31,230 --> 01:52:31,790
Charity.

2630
01:52:32,010 --> 01:52:33,170
To help...

2631
01:52:33,170 --> 01:52:34,230
your butt.

2632
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:38,050
The planet.

2633
01:52:39,930 --> 01:52:41,230
Please, I need your help.

2634
01:52:42,010 --> 01:52:42,290
Grandma!

2635
01:52:42,690 --> 01:52:43,850
Yes, let's do it!

2636
01:52:47,710 --> 01:52:52,510
Recently, I keep getting these, like, emails in my business email that are like...

2637
01:52:52,510 --> 01:52:53,410
I don't even know...

2638
01:52:53,950 --> 01:52:54,470
Grandma!

2639
01:52:56,030 --> 01:52:56,630
Oh my god, stop.

2640
01:52:57,790 --> 01:52:58,310
Stop!

2641
01:52:59,090 --> 01:53:00,210
It's too much!

2642
01:53:01,390 --> 01:53:06,610
Please buy yourself anything Metal Gear related with this as a gift if you wanna otherwise use it on whatever!

2643
01:53:15,340 --> 01:53:16,860
It's too much!

2644
01:53:19,580 --> 01:53:20,100
No!

2645
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:21,560
But thank you, but no!

2646
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:27,940
It's way too much, thank you though, but no!

2647
01:53:39,580 --> 01:53:40,140
Please!

2648
01:53:40,660 --> 01:53:41,840
Don't worry about it.

2649
01:53:41,860 --> 01:53:43,620
I worry about it!

2650
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:46,100
I worry about it!

2651
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:46,820
Oh my gosh.

2652
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:48,720
I don't...

2653
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,320
First of all, don't enable...

2654
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:51,560
Okay.

2655
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:53,180
Did anybody see that...

2656
01:53:53,180 --> 01:53:53,620
That...

2657
01:53:53,620 --> 01:53:55,040
That statue?

2658
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:55,760
The...

2659
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:56,880
The one of the...

2660
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:57,960
Of...

2661
01:53:57,960 --> 01:53:58,440
Of...

2662
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:01,120
Big Boss, like, saluting at the grave?

2663
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:03,480
I'll be honest.

2664
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:04,980
I didn't think about it.

2665
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:05,900
But...

2666
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:07,160
I don't know.

2667
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:08,460
I don't wanna be...

2668
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:08,940
It's also...

2669
01:54:08,940 --> 01:54:11,320
First of all, it's huge, so I don't think I have any, like...

2670
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:12,940
I don't think I have anywhere to put it.

2671
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,120
And also...

2672
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:16,040
Um...

2673
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:17,260
I don't know.

2674
01:54:17,820 --> 01:54:21,160
I'm like, do I wanna be reminded of this sadness every single day?

2675
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:22,720
Yeah, I tagged you.

2676
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:24,260
I know, tons of people tagged me.

2677
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:27,640
Isn't it like $500 for the full one?

2678
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:28,200
It is.

2679
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:30,740
Yeah, it's quite expensive.

2680
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:31,880
It's quite pricey.

2681
01:54:32,260 --> 01:54:33,740
It would probably be the most...

2682
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:38,200
If I were to buy it, it would be the most expensive figure I'd ever bought ever.

2683
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:43,340
But...

2684
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:50,780
When I first saw it, the replies had you and Maddie immediately tagged.

2685
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:53,780
I'm more surprised you didn't pre-order it already.

2686
01:54:53,860 --> 01:54:54,660
Well, it's $500.

2687
01:54:57,620 --> 01:54:58,660
It's $500.

2688
01:54:58,660 --> 01:54:59,540
You know, I...

2689
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:00,660
I'm not just...

2690
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:01,220
You know...

2691
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:02,360
Even...

2692
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:03,000
You know...

2693
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:04,120
I...

2694
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:04,880
I am...

2695
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:06,220
I am careful with money.

2696
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:09,040
Contrary to popular belief.

2697
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:10,220
You know, I...

2698
01:55:11,700 --> 01:55:12,100
I'm careful with money.

2699
01:55:12,100 --> 01:55:12,340
But...

2700
01:55:14,260 --> 01:55:14,660
Gosh...

2701
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:15,600
I don't know.

2702
01:55:15,940 --> 01:55:17,260
Like I said, it's really big too.

2703
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:20,340
I thought...

2704
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:20,780
I don't know.

2705
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:24,180
Not much, but this is my big Boss Funds contribution nation.

2706
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:27,040
Thank you so much!

2707
01:55:29,180 --> 01:55:32,380
$500 for 1 fourth scale isn't even that much compared to some anime figures.

2708
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:33,020
That is so true.

2709
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:34,740
That is very true.

2710
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:36,060
That is very, very true.

2711
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:38,320
But also, I can play that, you know?

2712
01:55:38,860 --> 01:55:40,200
It's like buying a quarter of it.

2713
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:41,400
It's a console, basically.

2714
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:42,560
For one game.

2715
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:46,260
Everybody who bought the PS5.

2716
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:47,780
Me too.

2717
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:49,900
For DULT!

2718
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:00,480
Go to the world!

2719
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:09,720
Enabling only if you have the space!

2720
01:56:31,550 --> 01:56:34,230
Doing my part for the boss, thank you.

2721
01:56:36,850 --> 01:56:38,050
It's way too much.

2722
01:56:40,990 --> 01:56:42,150
It's way too much, please.

2723
01:56:43,490 --> 01:56:44,350
Oh gosh.

2724
01:56:51,400 --> 01:56:52,180
This is me.

2725
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:53,920
This is me right now.

2726
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:56,620
It's cool if you don't get it.

2727
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:56,880
Stop!

2728
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:01,080
I just think it's so much.

2729
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:02,840
And you said so much.

2730
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:04,260
Oh my gosh.

2731
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:06,960
To himself.

2732
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:08,000
Thanks for the gift.

2733
01:57:08,260 --> 01:57:09,080
I mean, not gifted.

2734
01:57:09,140 --> 01:57:09,720
Thanks for the donut.

2735
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:10,540
Thank you super chat.

2736
01:57:10,700 --> 01:57:11,280
Thank you so much.

2737
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:16,440
Even the chat AI thinks he already bought it.

2738
01:57:19,220 --> 01:57:20,080
Oh my gosh.

2739
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:20,720
Let's end the day.

2740
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:21,580
Let's end the day.

2741
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:24,240
Later that day.

2742
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:25,680
Okay.

2743
01:57:25,820 --> 01:57:28,220
This is their first non-awkward date, everybody.

2744
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:29,420
This is their first...

2745
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:34,760
Thanks for coming to this market with me.

2746
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:35,960
I'm so excited.

2747
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:37,440
Of course.

2748
01:57:37,660 --> 01:57:39,840
But to be honest, I haven't been to this one before.

2749
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:41,360
Oh.

2750
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:42,620
Let me show you around.

2751
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:47,000
It can get pretty crowded, so take my hand.

2752
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:52,120
Froggy here with the smooth moves.

2753
01:57:55,060 --> 01:57:55,500
What?

2754
01:57:55,740 --> 01:57:56,440
Okay.

2755
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:58,360
Phew.

2756
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:01,120
We made it through those crowds.

2757
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:03,460
Um, Camel.

2758
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:05,380
You're still holding my hand.

2759
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:06,600
Oh.

2760
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:07,360
I'm sorry.

2761
01:58:07,540 --> 01:58:08,160
I just...

2762
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:09,400
It's okay.

2763
01:58:10,140 --> 01:58:12,060
We should keep holding hands!

2764
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:15,400
Yeah.

2765
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:17,940
In case any crowds pop up again.

2766
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:20,920
Right.

2767
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:22,100
Just in case.

2768
01:58:27,890 --> 01:58:28,890
Baby incoming.

2769
01:58:29,090 --> 01:58:30,150
Don't say that!

2770
01:58:32,730 --> 01:58:33,610
What kind of creature?

2771
01:58:33,950 --> 01:58:35,830
This is the future of evolution.

2772
01:58:39,090 --> 01:58:40,370
The Riz!

2773
01:58:40,390 --> 01:58:41,870
Oh my gosh.

2774
01:58:42,270 --> 01:58:43,250
Oh my gosh.

2775
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:45,870
Chat, we are so back.

2776
01:58:45,870 --> 01:58:47,350
The date was good!

2777
01:58:50,190 --> 01:58:52,150
I think it was better than good.

2778
01:58:54,150 --> 01:58:56,210
House helper task was good!

2779
01:58:57,750 --> 01:59:00,190
Beeple's relationships with all other residents increased.

2780
01:59:00,810 --> 01:59:03,010
Alan just saved himself from becoming Niner.

2781
01:59:03,150 --> 01:59:04,090
It's true.

2782
01:59:05,230 --> 01:59:06,490
What a good day.

2783
01:59:06,670 --> 01:59:07,690
What a good day, everybody.

2784
01:59:10,970 --> 01:59:11,990
Let's see how you did!

2785
01:59:15,130 --> 01:59:16,670
Oh, it's 37!

2786
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:18,150
You guys, we killed it.

2787
01:59:18,210 --> 01:59:18,630
We killed it.

2788
01:59:18,650 --> 01:59:19,070
We killed it.

2789
01:59:21,110 --> 01:59:22,530
We can get hats now.

2790
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:23,810
Or the spooky song.

2791
01:59:24,290 --> 01:59:25,710
Scary song or hats.

2792
01:59:28,590 --> 01:59:36,330
Ene, mene, mene, mo, che ito, Apollo by it's toe, if it hollers let em go.

2793
01:59:36,510 --> 01:59:40,450
My mom said to pick the very best one.

2794
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:42,390
One, and you are it!

2795
01:59:42,650 --> 01:59:43,390
We're getting hats!

2796
01:59:47,950 --> 01:59:48,590
Confirm.

2797
01:59:48,850 --> 01:59:50,310
We got hats, everybody!

2798
01:59:52,290 --> 01:59:53,190
Apollo's happier.

2799
01:59:53,510 --> 01:59:54,910
There's some cheese on the ground!

2800
01:59:56,870 --> 01:59:58,130
The manor upgraded!

2801
02:00:01,110 --> 02:00:02,570
Check out the new wardrobe.

2802
02:00:04,890 --> 02:00:08,090
Oh my gosh, I'm a little devil.

2803
02:00:08,370 --> 02:00:09,550
I'm a little devil.

2804
02:00:09,550 --> 02:00:10,990
Oh, so cute!

2805
02:00:12,850 --> 02:00:14,350
Oh, I can't unlock this one yet.

2806
02:00:16,450 --> 02:00:17,470
Which one do we have?

2807
02:00:17,770 --> 02:00:18,970
The ribbon is really cute!

2808
02:00:21,050 --> 02:00:22,190
This one's so cute.

2809
02:00:23,270 --> 02:00:24,770
I like the devil one too, though.

2810
02:00:26,690 --> 02:00:27,570
Or the beret.

2811
02:00:29,590 --> 02:00:30,710
Okay, we'll go with the ribbon.

2812
02:00:31,370 --> 02:00:33,790
Wait, but if I do a blue ribbon, it matches me!

2813
02:00:34,010 --> 02:00:34,410
Actually!

2814
02:00:35,790 --> 02:00:37,050
Blue ribbon is just like Minto!

2815
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:37,470
Yeah!

2816
02:00:39,550 --> 02:00:40,170
Oh my gosh!

2817
02:00:40,410 --> 02:00:41,830
It looks just like me!

2818
02:00:44,690 --> 02:00:46,710
Oh my gosh, it looks just like me!

2819
02:00:46,730 --> 02:00:47,450
Is that a can of beans?

2820
02:00:47,730 --> 02:00:48,570
Oh, paint bucket.

2821
02:00:49,230 --> 02:00:49,670
Ouch!

2822
02:00:58,860 --> 02:01:01,020
I hit my knee on the table.

2823
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:03,620
Did you guys hear that?

2824
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,240
Oh...

2825
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:06,120
Where?

2826
02:01:09,020 --> 02:01:10,320
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2827
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:11,820
Oh god.

2828
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:15,300
I'm okay.

2829
02:01:18,740 --> 02:01:20,180
Oh my gosh!

2830
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:21,800
She's got little decorations and everything!

2831
02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:22,980
It's your diary.

2832
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:25,000
People gifted me a football clock.

2833
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:28,440
I'm adding this to my favorite things I've ever gotten list.

2834
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:31,100
Because it's from one of my favorite people at the moment.

2835
02:01:32,860 --> 02:01:34,360
Okay, why'd you have to say it like that?

2836
02:01:35,540 --> 02:01:38,200
Why can't people just be your favorite person?

2837
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:40,240
Breadsticks!

2838
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:43,840
Bag...

2839
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:44,400
Get...

2840
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:44,900
Bask...

2841
02:01:44,900 --> 02:01:45,600
Bask...

2842
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:46,060
Get...

2843
02:01:46,060 --> 02:01:47,100
Bask...

2844
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:47,860
Bag...

2845
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:51,780
Basket of baguettes!

2846
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:52,240
Wee!

2847
02:01:55,060 --> 02:01:55,960
Wee!

2848
02:01:56,020 --> 02:02:02,660
I cannot say that for some reason.

2849
02:02:03,700 --> 02:02:05,380
I cannot say it.

2850
02:02:05,380 --> 02:02:05,960
What is this thing?

2851
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:08,280
Hot air balloon lamp.

2852
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:09,460
Adventurous and bright.

2853
02:02:09,880 --> 02:02:11,700
None of these really fit everybody here.

2854
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:12,620
Maybe the artsy?

2855
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:13,980
Creative?

2856
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:15,100
It's like they're talking.

2857
02:02:19,230 --> 02:02:20,150
French wisps.

2858
02:02:20,370 --> 02:02:21,210
Where you at?

2859
02:02:21,330 --> 02:02:22,170
I know you're out there.

2860
02:02:23,830 --> 02:02:25,370
Say that five times really fast.

2861
02:02:25,450 --> 02:02:26,570
I can barely say it even once!

2862
02:02:28,130 --> 02:02:28,630
Bag...

2863
02:02:29,730 --> 02:02:30,230
Bag...

2864
02:02:30,230 --> 02:02:31,090
Bag...

2865
02:02:31,830 --> 02:02:32,330
Bags...

2866
02:02:32,330 --> 02:02:33,090
Bags...

2867
02:02:33,090 --> 02:02:34,070
Bask...

2868
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:36,250
Basket of baguettes.

2869
02:02:37,190 --> 02:02:37,690
Bask...

2870
02:02:37,690 --> 02:02:39,350
I can barely even say it once...

2871
02:02:39,350 --> 02:02:40,910
I cannot say this word.

2872
02:02:43,690 --> 02:02:44,430
Let's see...

2873
02:02:44,430 --> 02:02:45,470
Let's check the Internet...

2874
02:02:45,470 --> 02:02:47,310
See if there's anything here that...

2875
02:02:48,050 --> 02:02:49,770
The Ghost pepper...

2876
02:02:49,770 --> 02:02:50,850
Ghost plush!

2877
02:02:53,590 --> 02:02:54,790
Artsy Classical...

2878
02:02:54,790 --> 02:02:56,570
Classic musical...

2879
02:02:56,570 --> 02:02:58,430
None of these really fit, huh?

2880
02:02:58,750 --> 02:02:59,110
Oh!

2881
02:02:59,150 --> 02:02:59,710
The calm painting!

2882
02:02:59,970 --> 02:03:01,370
Let's go give this to...

2883
02:03:02,470 --> 02:03:03,270
Um, you.

2884
02:03:05,390 --> 02:03:05,990
Camel.

2885
02:03:08,510 --> 02:03:09,310
From Froggy.

2886
02:03:10,050 --> 02:03:10,450
Gift.

2887
02:03:15,050 --> 02:03:17,950
Check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.

2888
02:03:18,010 --> 02:03:19,310
I guess we don't always have to do gifts.

2889
02:03:19,370 --> 02:03:20,290
Because not always though.

2890
02:03:21,950 --> 02:03:23,470
Love, love, love, love, love!

2891
02:03:25,050 --> 02:03:26,070
Oh my gosh.

2892
02:03:27,110 --> 02:03:29,470
Enough love to have a conversation about it?

2893
02:03:29,670 --> 02:03:30,290
We're here?

2894
02:03:34,260 --> 02:03:34,660
Camel.

2895
02:03:37,540 --> 02:03:38,100
Oh.

2896
02:03:38,100 --> 02:03:38,200
Olin.

2897
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:39,980
Listen, I'm so sorry.

2898
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:41,640
Here is your payment.

2899
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:42,880
What?

2900
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:45,180
Whoa, this is very generous.

2901
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:46,560
But I thought you hated...

2902
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:47,340
I did.

2903
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:49,380
But I am no monster.

2904
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:52,240
You are a very talented seamstress after all.

2905
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:55,440
You still deserve recognition and compensation.

2906
02:03:55,980 --> 02:03:57,760
Oh, the redemption reel.

2907
02:03:58,280 --> 02:03:58,840
Goodbye.

2908
02:03:58,940 --> 02:03:59,160
Oh.

2909
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:01,060
Olin, wait!

2910
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:03,660
Yes?

2911
02:04:06,280 --> 02:04:07,320
Listen, please.

2912
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:09,100
I'm so, so sorry.

2913
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:12,120
I had my head stuck in this cosplay world.

2914
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:14,740
And I just assumed you meant wizard robes.

2915
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:16,440
And I just assumed you meant wizard robes.

2916
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:18,800
I think Camel was looking for something else.

2917
02:04:19,620 --> 02:04:22,420
I really should have taken my client into consideration.

2918
02:04:22,820 --> 02:04:25,820
And I should have known you meant ceremonial robes.

2919
02:04:25,900 --> 02:04:26,240
And I should have known you meant ceremonial robes.

2920
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:27,960
Or I should have at least clarified with you.

2921
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:31,720
Yes, that's what's foolish of you to assume.

2922
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:32,860
What?

2923
02:04:34,860 --> 02:04:35,900
Clarify, Froggy!

2924
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:36,820
Shut the hell up!

2925
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:39,700
Please accept my apology.

2926
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:41,220
You were my first customer.

2927
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:43,080
And I'm still learning how to do all of this.

2928
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:44,720
Very well.

2929
02:04:45,220 --> 02:04:52,400
And as long as we're apologizing, I suppose I could have discussed details with you further as well.

2930
02:04:53,020 --> 02:04:55,820
And I could have been more courteous about it.

2931
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:57,420
Yeah, exactly.

2932
02:04:58,400 --> 02:04:58,920
Oh.

2933
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:02,660
Would you please accept my apology, Camel?

2934
02:05:04,140 --> 02:05:05,060
Oh, of course.

2935
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:06,260
Thank you.

2936
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:06,880
Okay.

2937
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:10,680
And all is well.

2938
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:13,980
All is well that ends well.

2939
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:15,500
Oh my gosh.

2940
02:05:16,100 --> 02:05:17,460
Oh my gosh.

2941
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:20,520
Let's send an email.

2942
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:21,720
Let's go scam some people.

2943
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:23,600
Love is in the air.

2944
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:25,280
Hi.

2945
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:26,820
I couldn't help but notice...

2946
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:29,860
You're a ghost!

2947
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:31,940
And we have...

2948
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:34,280
Oh, a heist!

2949
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:35,320
That!

2950
02:05:41,320 --> 02:05:41,960
Oh no!

2951
02:05:42,100 --> 02:05:43,060
Straight up isn't working!

2952
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:44,120
I messed it up!

2953
02:05:44,140 --> 02:05:44,960
I messed it up big time!

2954
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:48,080
If you are interested, send money now to reserve your position.

2955
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:52,440
There was a podcast in there?

2956
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:53,740
I'm not convinced.

2957
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:54,680
But here's a little something.

2958
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:57,020
Hey, pity money.

2959
02:06:06,890 --> 02:06:07,850
They're talking.

2960
02:06:08,170 --> 02:06:09,030
They're hanging out.

2961
02:06:10,190 --> 02:06:11,570
Okay, now let's do...

2962
02:06:12,140 --> 02:06:13,570
Ride a tandem bicycle.

2963
02:06:15,110 --> 02:06:16,030
Apollo and...

2964
02:06:16,590 --> 02:06:17,050
Beepo.

2965
02:06:17,310 --> 02:06:19,110
Oh my gosh, they're almost maxed!

2966
02:06:19,770 --> 02:06:21,430
Oh my gosh, Camel.

2967
02:06:21,890 --> 02:06:24,670
Oh my gosh, this fits every single person here!

2968
02:06:24,990 --> 02:06:25,830
This is perfect!

2969
02:06:26,610 --> 02:06:28,070
Podcast was one of the responses.

2970
02:06:28,690 --> 02:06:30,770
This game scares me a little bit, you guys.

2971
02:06:34,210 --> 02:06:35,370
This game scares me.

2972
02:06:35,390 --> 02:06:37,190
It's a little on the nose sometimes, I think.

2973
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:45,820
Beepo has no legs.

2974
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:48,200
Wear a hat!

2975
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:49,620
While watching a date.

2976
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:53,200
Hold on, I'm eating my croissant.

2977
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:56,780
I'm eating my croissant.

2978
02:07:12,450 --> 02:07:13,090
I'm eating my croissant.

2979
02:07:13,090 --> 02:07:13,910
I almost choked on my croissant.

2980
02:07:14,290 --> 02:07:15,010
I almost choked on my croissant.

2981
02:07:15,010 --> 02:07:15,550
I'm okay.

2982
02:07:16,250 --> 02:07:17,230
This is amazing.

2983
02:07:17,950 --> 02:07:19,770
Yeah, you're pretty good at this.

2984
02:07:20,030 --> 02:07:22,090
You mean we're pretty good at this.

2985
02:07:24,590 --> 02:07:25,070
I'm doing great.

2986
02:07:25,070 --> 02:07:26,690
And on this tandem bike, we'll be unstoppable!

2987
02:07:29,670 --> 02:07:31,810
What was that evil cackle for?

2988
02:07:34,150 --> 02:07:38,670
Because I'm going to take us to all the most fun and exciting places I can think of!

2989
02:07:42,660 --> 02:07:45,140
Because I want to share my favorite things with you.

2990
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:48,460
If you're okay with that.

2991
02:07:50,820 --> 02:07:52,740
Well, as long as it's with you.

2992
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:54,780
Well, as long as it's with you.

2993
02:07:54,780 --> 02:07:55,460
I think that sounds great.

2994
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:58,360
Perfect.

2995
02:07:58,600 --> 02:07:59,480
Let's get pedaling!

2996
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:01,700
Apollo likes I'm freaky, you guys.

2997
02:08:02,820 --> 02:08:05,600
Did Apollo manage to stop Beeple from beating all his friends?

2998
02:08:05,660 --> 02:08:06,160
I don't think so.

2999
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:08,380
I think Beeple has killed them at this point.

3000
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:22,300
It's almost... there's like a tiny sliver.

3001
02:08:22,700 --> 02:08:24,220
The tiniest sliver.

3002
02:08:25,160 --> 02:08:25,960
Camel happier.

3003
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:29,280
Froggy, good.

3004
02:08:30,920 --> 02:08:31,400
Yes!

3005
02:08:31,420 --> 02:08:31,800
Yes!

3006
02:08:32,100 --> 02:08:32,260
Yes!

3007
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:36,000
What happens at five hearts?

3008
02:08:36,060 --> 02:08:36,520
I don't know!

3009
02:08:36,620 --> 02:08:37,180
And I'm scared!

3010
02:08:38,280 --> 02:08:38,980
I'm scared.

3011
02:08:39,100 --> 02:08:39,320
I'm scared.

3012
02:08:39,420 --> 02:08:39,620
I'm scared.

3013
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:45,320
Camel is happier.

3014
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:48,140
Oh, Camel.

3015
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:48,440
Sorry.

3016
02:08:50,480 --> 02:08:50,960
Wow!

3017
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:51,860
So cute!

3018
02:08:52,260 --> 02:08:54,940
This dude... Froggy has nothing in his room.

3019
02:08:57,220 --> 02:08:58,780
I got the ghost plushie.

3020
02:09:02,860 --> 02:09:05,300
I think this would be good for Froggy.

3021
02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:06,340
Yeah, steal that.

3022
02:09:06,940 --> 02:09:08,160
We'll just give that right away.

3023
02:09:09,340 --> 02:09:12,600
I think we haven't done a lot for Froggy, so he probably is unhappy.

3024
02:09:13,060 --> 02:09:14,000
He's like, this is unfair.

3025
02:09:14,300 --> 02:09:15,080
I'm being treated.

3026
02:09:15,140 --> 02:09:17,600
I'm being treated wrongly in this place.

3027
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:23,220
There was nothing in your room, Jack.

3028
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:24,500
Hahaha!

3029
02:09:26,660 --> 02:09:27,460
Oh my gosh.

3030
02:09:27,540 --> 02:09:29,420
The slowest walker ever in existence.

3031
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:31,360
Yeah!

3032
02:09:32,020 --> 02:09:32,840
Big love!

3033
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:33,420
Big love!

3034
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:39,240
Discovered a clear sick.

3035
02:09:41,420 --> 02:09:41,940
Perfect.

3036
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:42,220
Oh!

3037
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:51,100
They're dying.

3038
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:52,120
Oh my gosh.

3039
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:53,440
You'll never believe what happened.

3040
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:56,060
I was considering locking myself up in my room forever.

3041
02:09:56,380 --> 02:09:57,020
Oh my gosh.

3042
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:57,420
Such a mood.

3043
02:09:57,420 --> 02:09:59,940
But all unapologized about the robes.

3044
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,740
I guess next time I should clarify what the request is.

3045
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:03,720
Lesson learned.

3046
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:06,220
Does Froggy know what day it is?

3047
02:10:06,220 --> 02:10:06,760
I have no idea.

3048
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:08,000
Popcorn machine!

3049
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:13,420
That's pretty fun.

3050
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:18,200
Even up here looks fancy, right?

3051
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:19,460
Even the attic looks nicer.

3052
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:25,460
Family portrait... of... of... rowboats?

3053
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:30,920
This one I think would also be good for Froggy, huh?

3054
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:32,520
I think, yeah.

3055
02:10:32,540 --> 02:10:34,040
It's a family portrait of canoes.

3056
02:10:42,130 --> 02:10:43,010
Maybe it's good.

3057
02:10:45,410 --> 02:10:46,050
Perfume tray.

3058
02:10:46,390 --> 02:10:46,830
Interesting.

3059
02:10:47,090 --> 02:10:48,050
Fancy and fashionable.

3060
02:10:49,250 --> 02:10:49,690
Fancy!

3061
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:52,110
Okay, we're giving you two things.

3062
02:10:52,390 --> 02:10:53,710
It's your lucky day, man.

3063
02:10:56,330 --> 02:10:57,690
It's your lucky day.

3064
02:10:59,550 --> 02:11:00,790
It's your lucky day.

3065
02:11:02,390 --> 02:11:03,850
Grandpa and grandma...

3066
02:11:03,850 --> 02:11:05,130
Oh my god, he loves it!

3067
02:11:10,270 --> 02:11:12,030
This is so silly.

3068
02:11:13,810 --> 02:11:16,290
That's some love love going on right there.

3069
02:11:16,730 --> 02:11:18,870
Look, there's hearts coming out from their heads.

3070
02:11:19,570 --> 02:11:22,930
Let's go... love is in the air and so is scamming people.

3071
02:11:23,950 --> 02:11:24,510
Scam!

3072
02:11:24,530 --> 02:11:24,870
Scam!

3073
02:11:24,870 --> 02:11:25,130
Scam!

3074
02:11:25,210 --> 02:11:26,930
Are you tired of...

3075
02:11:29,290 --> 02:11:29,810
...things?

3076
02:11:30,470 --> 02:11:36,050
You could be earning a million coins every week if you became...

3077
02:11:37,950 --> 02:11:38,470
...interesting.

3078
02:11:40,610 --> 02:11:43,930
If you're interested, please send...

3079
02:11:45,930 --> 02:11:46,590
Oh, shoot.

3080
02:11:46,750 --> 02:11:47,770
Your favorite TV show.

3081
02:11:47,870 --> 02:11:48,170
Dang it.

3082
02:11:51,090 --> 02:11:52,550
Earn a million coins a week!

3083
02:11:52,830 --> 02:11:54,110
Oh my gosh, we're girlbossing.

3084
02:11:54,570 --> 02:11:55,730
First time scamming?

3085
02:11:56,170 --> 02:11:58,070
Gold match those shapes better, pal.

3086
02:11:58,970 --> 02:12:00,810
I was only off one!

3087
02:12:02,050 --> 02:12:02,430
Gosh.

3088
02:12:03,990 --> 02:12:04,750
Tough crowd.

3089
02:12:06,310 --> 02:12:07,070
Cactus plush.

3090
02:12:07,710 --> 02:12:08,890
Arcade machine is so awesome.

3091
02:12:12,350 --> 02:12:13,130
I'm gonna buy it.

3092
02:12:15,390 --> 02:12:15,770
Order.

3093
02:12:17,110 --> 02:12:18,430
We'll just hold on to it, right?

3094
02:12:18,610 --> 02:12:19,550
What's in our... wait.

3095
02:12:19,710 --> 02:12:20,450
What's in our inventory?

3096
02:12:20,990 --> 02:12:21,590
No, no, no.

3097
02:12:21,670 --> 02:12:22,330
Oh, wait.

3098
02:12:22,390 --> 02:12:23,010
Yeah, let's end the day.

3099
02:12:23,910 --> 02:12:24,730
What's in our inventory?

3100
02:12:24,850 --> 02:12:25,150
Okay, wait.

3101
02:12:25,890 --> 02:12:26,670
What's in our inventory?

3102
02:12:27,670 --> 02:12:28,230
Oh, here.

3103
02:12:29,450 --> 02:12:30,330
We have the pickle.

3104
02:12:31,030 --> 02:12:32,070
And we have the ghost.

3105
02:12:33,510 --> 02:12:33,950
Relationships.

3106
02:12:35,010 --> 02:12:35,450
Wow.

3107
02:12:35,590 --> 02:12:37,030
All he cares is for people.

3108
02:12:46,210 --> 02:12:46,950
He's committed.

3109
02:12:47,510 --> 02:12:48,610
Eyes for no other.

3110
02:12:51,910 --> 02:12:54,150
Eyes for literally no other.

3111
02:12:56,090 --> 02:12:56,530
Wow!

3112
02:12:57,030 --> 02:13:00,650
Looks like some of your residents are ready to move on to the next phase of their life!

3113
02:13:01,150 --> 02:13:01,790
Don't worry.

3114
02:13:01,950 --> 02:13:03,190
They're not gonna become ghosts.

3115
02:13:04,070 --> 02:13:05,570
That's the next phase of their life.

3116
02:13:06,330 --> 02:13:13,890
Whenever residents reach max relationship level or max happiness, you can watch their final relationship talk or read their final diary entry at the end of the day.

3117
02:13:14,390 --> 02:13:20,270
However, keep in mind that they'll also move out of the manor tomorrow if we decide to do so.

3118
02:13:21,970 --> 02:13:23,830
Well, it might seem sad to see them go.

3119
02:13:24,510 --> 02:13:27,210
You should know that you helped them find a happier life.

3120
02:13:28,630 --> 02:13:31,010
Plus, this lets more residents move in.

3121
02:13:32,270 --> 02:13:33,770
Until we run out of residents.

3122
02:13:34,490 --> 02:13:36,610
You don't have to make a decision right now, either.

3123
02:13:36,810 --> 02:13:38,250
You can move them out when you're ready.

3124
02:13:40,850 --> 02:13:42,790
The Apollo Expedition...

3125
02:13:43,490 --> 02:13:44,910
is ready to launch.

3126
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:03,960
Wait, I thought it was Apollo!

3127
02:14:17,270 --> 02:14:19,470
It's all in Ed Campbell!

3128
02:14:26,770 --> 02:14:31,090
I'm so sorry.

3129
02:14:31,090 --> 02:14:31,190
It's all in Ed Campbell!

3130
02:14:31,190 --> 02:14:33,750
I was so prepared for people and...

3131
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:36,030
Apollo to leave.

3132
02:14:37,450 --> 02:14:39,530
But it wasn't even them!

3133
02:14:41,970 --> 02:14:43,130
I'm so sorry!

3134
02:14:43,130 --> 02:14:43,310
OK.

3135
02:14:44,810 --> 02:14:46,870
We'll be doing this final relationship talk.

3136
02:14:46,950 --> 02:14:47,790
We'll commit this bear.

3137
02:14:48,830 --> 02:14:50,970
And they will move out of the manor.

3138
02:14:51,550 --> 02:14:52,790
Are you sure you want to proceed?

3139
02:14:53,150 --> 02:14:53,190
Are you sure you want to proceed?

3140
02:14:54,210 --> 02:14:55,750
Wait, wait, wait, I'm not ready yet.

3141
02:14:56,810 --> 02:14:57,850
I want to see it.

3142
02:14:58,610 --> 02:15:01,430
I want to see Froggy's room.

3143
02:15:02,190 --> 02:15:03,970
I just gave you all that stuff.

3144
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:11,460
10 out of 10 plot twists.

3145
02:15:11,560 --> 02:15:12,300
That was crazy.

3146
02:15:14,820 --> 02:15:15,740
Wait until tomorrow?

3147
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:16,460
Yeah, we'll wait.

3148
02:15:16,900 --> 02:15:18,220
Are you finished with moving out?

3149
02:15:18,340 --> 02:15:19,000
Yeah, yeah, go for it.

3150
02:15:20,820 --> 02:15:21,520
Day 12.

3151
02:15:29,320 --> 02:15:32,120
Hi Mintel, is it probably the anxiety voice in my head talking?

3152
02:15:32,380 --> 02:15:38,700
I hope us fans who really like your chemistry with streamers you've collabed with don't weird you out so much that it makes you not want to collab with them.

3153
02:15:38,920 --> 02:15:40,060
We can always tone it down.

3154
02:15:41,120 --> 02:15:42,640
No, I've never felt that way.

3155
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:43,900
Don't worry about it.

3156
02:15:46,340 --> 02:15:49,940
Usually if I'm not collabing with someone it's... Whoa!

3157
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:51,760
Holy fancy!

3158
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:55,200
If I'm not collabing with someone it's usually a schedule thing.

3159
02:16:00,770 --> 02:16:02,290
Oh my gosh, fancy room.

3160
02:16:04,290 --> 02:16:05,230
Okay, thank you.

3161
02:16:05,350 --> 02:16:05,670
Yeah!

3162
02:16:06,590 --> 02:16:07,490
What is this?

3163
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:08,630
Oh, it's a box!

3164
02:16:10,130 --> 02:16:11,530
It's a cardboard box!

3165
02:16:15,170 --> 02:16:16,170
Love ghostie?

3166
02:16:16,250 --> 02:16:16,990
I sure do!

3167
02:16:21,270 --> 02:16:22,490
That one's for me.

3168
02:16:22,610 --> 02:16:24,210
Look at that giant burger!

3169
02:16:25,130 --> 02:16:26,310
Really big burger.

3170
02:16:26,350 --> 02:16:28,230
Sorry, it's a really big burger, not a giant burger.

3171
02:16:29,010 --> 02:16:30,910
Fast food that slows you down.

3172
02:16:31,210 --> 02:16:35,430
Actually, thinking about that kind of is making me feel a little...

3173
02:16:36,490 --> 02:16:40,950
Dear diary, do you ever feel like other people's happiness is how you measure your own happiness?

3174
02:16:41,250 --> 02:16:45,430
What am I supposed to do when there's no one else to make happy though?

3175
02:16:46,350 --> 02:16:48,630
What do you mean by that?

3176
02:16:49,950 --> 02:16:51,170
They're in love love.

3177
02:16:51,510 --> 02:16:52,290
Where, where?

3178
02:16:52,390 --> 02:16:52,950
Oh, there you go.

3179
02:16:53,830 --> 02:16:54,670
Where's your diary?

3180
02:16:54,810 --> 02:16:55,190
Oh, right here.

3181
02:17:00,370 --> 02:17:02,430
Is that a Metal Gear reference?

3182
02:17:02,910 --> 02:17:03,290
No.

3183
02:17:04,110 --> 02:17:04,670
Maybe.

3184
02:17:05,210 --> 02:17:05,770
Fries!

3185
02:17:05,990 --> 02:17:07,350
Wait, we have burger and fries.

3186
02:17:07,590 --> 02:17:08,070
That's crazy.

3187
02:17:08,830 --> 02:17:09,850
A cute clock.

3188
02:17:10,970 --> 02:17:13,330
Well, I'm not going to give you guys anything else because you're leaving.

3189
02:17:13,590 --> 02:17:15,070
You're literally moving out.

3190
02:17:15,490 --> 02:17:16,790
Why would I give you anything?

3191
02:17:18,490 --> 02:17:19,770
A lost painting.

3192
02:17:20,070 --> 02:17:21,310
Mysterious talisman.

3193
02:17:21,390 --> 02:17:21,650
Fun.

3194
02:17:29,380 --> 02:17:30,480
Moving out present.

3195
02:17:32,460 --> 02:17:34,240
It's a waste of my activity points.

3196
02:17:39,220 --> 02:17:41,940
What if I send like two of them on a date?

3197
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:45,060
What if I send like Beepo and Froggy on a date?

3198
02:17:49,060 --> 02:17:50,280
Visit a science museum!

3199
02:17:50,580 --> 02:17:51,260
Wait a second.

3200
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:52,980
This is literally perfect for them.

3201
02:17:53,660 --> 02:17:55,000
This is perfect for them.

3202
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:08,260
This is not what Allyn likes to do, but your last, your last thing that you do in this household is you wash the windows, Froggy Prince.

3203
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:10,440
Oh my gosh.

3204
02:18:10,440 --> 02:18:13,100
Wait, Camel's going to become a, become royalty.

3205
02:18:13,980 --> 02:18:14,460
Maybe.

3206
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:15,980
Maybe.

3207
02:18:17,060 --> 02:18:17,540
Okay.

3208
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:18,500
Let's send a scam email.

3209
02:18:20,620 --> 02:18:21,100
Hello.

3210
02:18:21,480 --> 02:18:24,960
There has been a massive security breach today.

3211
02:18:25,160 --> 02:18:26,660
In order to...

3212
02:18:29,220 --> 02:18:32,060
Not delete your butt.

3213
02:18:32,380 --> 02:18:34,680
Why is there so much about the butt?

3214
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:37,060
Your business.

3215
02:18:37,300 --> 02:18:40,120
Please send money and your...

3216
02:18:41,560 --> 02:18:42,180
Address.

3217
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:45,520
To us immediately.

3218
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:50,660
I can't lose my scamming business.

3219
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:51,760
Take my coins now!

3220
02:18:53,540 --> 02:18:55,440
Uh, you did not send your address.

3221
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:57,660
Get...

3222
02:18:58,540 --> 02:18:59,100
Get...

3223
02:18:59,100 --> 02:19:00,440
Get hacked.

3224
02:19:03,060 --> 02:19:03,620
Okay.

3225
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:04,640
Let's end the day.

3226
02:19:06,580 --> 02:19:07,740
Here we go, everybody.

3227
02:19:07,900 --> 02:19:08,360
Here we go.

3228
02:19:08,640 --> 02:19:09,340
Here we go.

3229
02:19:09,420 --> 02:19:09,760
Here we go.

3230
02:19:17,670 --> 02:19:19,330
A science museum chore?

3231
02:19:19,630 --> 02:19:20,470
No way!

3232
02:19:20,690 --> 02:19:21,990
I love science museums!

3233
02:19:23,270 --> 02:19:23,970
Me too.

3234
02:19:24,150 --> 02:19:27,270
I love those self-guided audio tours and walking around.

3235
02:19:28,510 --> 02:19:30,430
I love running around and learning!

3236
02:19:30,870 --> 02:19:31,050
Woo!

3237
02:19:31,750 --> 02:19:32,230
Yippee!

3238
02:19:33,170 --> 02:19:35,230
Oh no, they're out of audio tour tapes.

3239
02:19:36,090 --> 02:19:36,810
Oh no.

3240
02:19:37,210 --> 02:19:38,090
I have an idea.

3241
02:19:38,270 --> 02:19:40,370
Why don't I read out everything for you?

3242
02:19:42,950 --> 02:19:47,050
You can go through the exhibits without reading and enjoy them with just your eyes.

3243
02:19:49,470 --> 02:19:49,950
What?

3244
02:19:49,950 --> 02:19:50,430
No.

3245
02:19:50,550 --> 02:19:52,030
I couldn't ask you to do that.

3246
02:19:52,110 --> 02:19:53,670
There are a lot of signs here.

3247
02:19:54,630 --> 02:19:55,110
Nonsense.

3248
02:19:55,250 --> 02:19:56,670
I love reading out loud.

3249
02:19:56,850 --> 02:19:58,490
Let me put on my narrator voice.

3250
02:20:00,130 --> 02:20:02,330
You guys are so lucky.

3251
02:20:02,710 --> 02:20:06,570
You guys are so lucky I'm not on my normal computer.

3252
02:20:09,350 --> 02:20:16,170
You guys are so lucky I'm not on my normal computer to use the narrator voice.

3253
02:20:21,110 --> 02:20:22,190
I would...

3254
02:20:22,190 --> 02:20:28,470
If I had time, literally, I would download the voice mod right now.

3255
02:20:28,470 --> 02:20:31,330
And I would... I would do it.

3256
02:20:33,670 --> 02:20:34,410
Ahem.

3257
02:20:40,270 --> 02:20:46,010
Welcome to our award-winning audio tour.

3258
02:20:46,290 --> 02:20:50,170
This is a special tour just for Beep-o.

3259
02:20:50,710 --> 02:20:51,370
Beep-o.

3260
02:20:51,650 --> 02:20:52,230
Beep-o.

3261
02:20:53,050 --> 02:20:53,690
Beep-o.

3262
02:20:54,930 --> 02:20:55,670
Beep

3263
02:20:59,530 --> 02:20:59,650
-o.

3264
02:21:00,050 --> 02:21:00,250
Beep -o.

3265
02:21:00,930 --> 02:21:00,930
Beep-o.

3266
02:21:00,950 --> 02:21:00,950
Beep-o.

3267
02:21:01,170 --> 02:21:01,170
Beep-o.

3268
02:21:01,170 --> 02:21:01,990
Beep-o.

3269
02:21:01,990 --> 02:21:02,310
Beep-o.

3270
02:21:02,310 --> 02:21:02,310
Beep-o.

3271
02:21:02,310 --> 02:21:02,310
Beep-o.

3272
02:21:02,310 --> 02:21:02,310
Beep-o.

3273
02:21:02,310 --> 02:21:02,310
Beep-o.

3274
02:21:02,310 --> 02:21:02,310
Beep-o.

3275
02:21:02,310 --> 02:21:02,310
Beep-o.

3276
02:21:02,310 --> 02:21:02,870
Beep-o.

3277
02:21:02,870 --> 02:21:03,090
Beep-o.

3278
02:21:03,330 --> 02:21:04,430
Beep-o.

3279
02:21:04,990 --> 02:21:05,830
Beep-o.

3280
02:21:05,830 --> 02:21:05,830
Beep-o.

3281
02:21:05,830 --> 02:21:05,830
Beep-o.

3282
02:21:05,830 --> 02:21:05,830
Beep-o.

3283
02:21:05,830 --> 02:21:10,290
Please keep all hands inside the vehicle at all times.

3284
02:21:10,990 --> 02:21:12,370
What vehicle?

3285
02:21:12,990 --> 02:21:17,370
Please save all questions until after the tour.

3286
02:21:25,070 --> 02:21:29,290
This is better than any audio tour I could have imagined.

3287
02:21:29,290 --> 02:21:30,490
Thank you, Apollo.

3288
02:21:30,750 --> 02:21:31,970
She's really into that.

3289
02:21:33,250 --> 02:21:34,750
She loves AI voice.

3290
02:21:35,830 --> 02:21:37,130
Robots, after all, you know.

3291
02:21:43,370 --> 02:21:45,230
Why can you do the laugh so well?

3292
02:21:46,350 --> 02:21:47,210
Because I'm obsessed.

3293
02:21:49,130 --> 02:21:49,610
Maxed.

3294
02:21:50,750 --> 02:21:51,950
Everybody's going to leave, you guys.

3295
02:21:51,970 --> 02:21:53,310
We're going to get four whole new residents.

3296
02:21:58,280 --> 02:21:58,760
Okay.

3297
02:22:00,360 --> 02:22:01,520
Oh my gosh.

3298
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:05,000
Goodbye, everyone.

3299
02:22:06,560 --> 02:22:07,640
Everybody, goodbye.

3300
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:10,780
Tiger cyber.

3301
02:22:12,780 --> 02:22:15,400
And whatever this cursed couple is.

3302
02:22:20,110 --> 02:22:22,650
Cam, I have something to show you.

3303
02:22:24,370 --> 02:22:26,110
Oh my gosh.

3304
02:22:26,870 --> 02:22:29,490
It's a photo of you in the wizard robes.

3305
02:22:32,530 --> 02:22:34,130
Now that's a little sensual.

3306
02:22:34,550 --> 02:22:35,510
Well, yes.

3307
02:22:35,770 --> 02:22:37,770
They are beautifully made, after all.

3308
02:22:37,890 --> 02:22:39,130
Shouldn't go to waste.

3309
02:22:39,450 --> 02:22:42,350
It's you in only the wizard robes.

3310
02:22:44,910 --> 02:22:46,490
They're also very comfortable.

3311
02:22:47,230 --> 02:22:48,570
Oh my gosh, Alan.

3312
02:22:48,790 --> 02:22:50,030
I'm so glad you wore them.

3313
02:22:50,630 --> 02:22:52,390
What do you have there, Camel?

3314
02:22:52,790 --> 02:22:56,370
Oh, well, I ended up making the original request.

3315
02:22:57,110 --> 02:22:58,350
Oh my goodness.

3316
02:23:00,250 --> 02:23:04,030
Are these my ceremonial robes?

3317
02:23:05,450 --> 02:23:06,090
Yes.

3318
02:23:06,190 --> 02:23:07,230
And, um, I...

3319
02:23:09,410 --> 02:23:12,390
My eyes cannot begin to understand the beauty.

3320
02:23:12,990 --> 02:23:13,630
Um.

3321
02:23:13,850 --> 02:23:16,150
That I have just been presented with.

3322
02:23:16,290 --> 02:23:17,490
Is this happening?

3323
02:23:18,330 --> 02:23:18,970
Yes.

3324
02:23:19,870 --> 02:23:20,510
Camel.

3325
02:23:20,510 --> 02:23:24,990
This is single-handedly the most beautiful piece of wardrobe I have ever seen.

3326
02:23:25,250 --> 02:23:27,610
To say this is no easy feat.

3327
02:23:28,130 --> 02:23:28,610
Oh.

3328
02:23:28,670 --> 02:23:29,350
Oh wow.

3329
02:23:29,630 --> 02:23:31,310
This settles it.

3330
02:23:31,390 --> 02:23:33,750
You are officially in charge of all my clothing.

3331
02:23:33,950 --> 02:23:34,190
Oh.

3332
02:23:36,390 --> 02:23:38,590
This is a... This is some kind of relationship.

3333
02:23:39,490 --> 02:23:40,170
I think.

3334
02:23:41,370 --> 02:23:41,850
What?

3335
02:23:44,150 --> 02:23:44,850
Yes, yes.

3336
02:23:44,970 --> 02:23:46,130
Please do not hesitate.

3337
02:23:46,310 --> 02:23:48,790
No one can ever compare to you for this role.

3338
02:23:50,530 --> 02:23:51,750
Do you really mean it?

3339
02:23:51,830 --> 02:23:53,650
No one's ever loved my work this much.

3340
02:23:54,710 --> 02:23:56,110
A business relationship.

3341
02:23:56,250 --> 02:23:56,630
Yeah.

3342
02:23:57,610 --> 02:23:58,530
Then they are fools.

3343
02:23:59,470 --> 02:24:01,310
Everything you do is a masterpiece.

3344
02:24:01,830 --> 02:24:04,730
Because I can see you put your heart into it.

3345
02:24:05,530 --> 02:24:08,370
Oh, imagine what everyone will think when I put this on.

3346
02:24:08,550 --> 02:24:09,430
Come, Camel.

3347
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:11,150
We have much to do.

3348
02:24:11,390 --> 02:24:12,090
Quick, quick.

3349
02:24:14,050 --> 02:24:14,810
Oh gosh.

3350
02:24:15,050 --> 02:24:16,290
What have I gotten myself into?

3351
02:24:17,650 --> 02:24:18,770
But I'm honored.

3352
02:24:21,050 --> 02:24:21,670
That's it?

3353
02:24:27,650 --> 02:24:29,090
They're so small together.

3354
02:24:29,490 --> 02:24:30,770
I just realized.

3355
02:24:31,030 --> 02:24:32,470
Look how small they are.

3356
02:24:34,770 --> 02:24:35,970
He didn't get a partner.

3357
02:24:36,010 --> 02:24:36,730
He got a tailor.

3358
02:24:38,330 --> 02:24:39,150
There we go.

3359
02:24:39,250 --> 02:24:40,650
Everybody's moving out, you guys.

3360
02:24:41,650 --> 02:24:43,010
Literally, so no .

3361
02:24:44,590 --> 02:24:45,870
But didn't they confess?

3362
02:24:46,350 --> 02:24:47,210
The manga?

3363
02:24:47,210 --> 02:24:49,010
Oh my gosh.

3364
02:24:49,050 --> 02:24:50,790
Sorry, the TV has some unadon.

3365
02:24:51,730 --> 02:24:52,890
Looks delicious.

3366
02:24:54,590 --> 02:24:55,230
Unadon.

3367
02:24:58,560 --> 02:25:02,580
It's summer but I still haven't had any unagi yet.

3368
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:05,540
It's summer but I still haven't had any unagi.

3369
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:07,440
I haven't eaten yet.

3370
02:25:09,080 --> 02:25:10,420
I haven't eaten yet.

3371
02:25:15,140 --> 02:25:16,480
It looks so good.

3372
02:25:17,620 --> 02:25:18,880
Oh my god.

3373
02:25:19,160 --> 02:25:19,260
Oh.

3374
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:21,500
No.

3375
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:23,540
It looks so good.

3376
02:25:25,400 --> 02:25:26,100
Sorry, okay.

3377
02:25:26,180 --> 02:25:27,540
I'm not looking at the TV anymore.

3378
02:25:30,300 --> 02:25:32,020
Still time once your stomach settles down.

3379
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:33,320
Yeah, I have a little bit of time.

3380
02:25:34,060 --> 02:25:34,480
People.

3381
02:25:34,640 --> 02:25:35,540
You have to stop this.

3382
02:25:36,400 --> 02:25:36,960
Oh no.

3383
02:25:37,120 --> 02:25:39,220
Am I not your best friend anymore, Apollo?

3384
02:25:42,060 --> 02:25:42,800
No, you are.

3385
02:25:43,180 --> 02:25:45,240
Why are you trying to defeat all my other friends?

3386
02:25:46,200 --> 02:25:48,800
Well, being your best friend felt like a lot of responsibility.

3387
02:25:53,700 --> 02:25:57,540
I'm so excited to be your best friend, but I don't know if I'm good enough.

3388
02:25:58,440 --> 02:26:02,300
So I have to defeat all your other friends to be sure that I am the best.

3389
02:26:03,100 --> 02:26:03,920
Little people.

3390
02:26:04,600 --> 02:26:05,080
Friendship?

3391
02:26:05,080 --> 02:26:05,400
Wait.

3392
02:26:05,720 --> 02:26:08,580
So first we have a business relationship and then this is...

3393
02:26:08,580 --> 02:26:11,400
This does not feel very romantic.

3394
02:26:14,500 --> 02:26:15,720
Friendship isn't a competition?

3395
02:26:16,620 --> 02:26:17,500
And to be honest...

3396
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:19,680
Oh!

3397
02:26:19,700 --> 02:26:19,980
Oh!

3398
02:26:21,060 --> 02:26:27,540
To be honest, I was hoping that our friendship would bloom into something more than just friends.

3399
02:26:28,820 --> 02:26:29,340
Really?

3400
02:26:31,460 --> 02:26:33,100
That's what I was hoping for too.

3401
02:26:34,660 --> 02:26:39,520
Well then, maybe we should cool off on the whole defeating all of my friends thing.

3402
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:44,960
And focus more on the more than friends thing.

3403
02:26:46,680 --> 02:26:50,000
Yes, I would much rather focus my attention on that.

3404
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:54,500
And after that, we can be the best couple.

3405
02:26:55,260 --> 02:26:57,980
Does that mean we have to defeat the other couples?

3406
02:26:59,020 --> 02:27:02,200
Yes, I already have plans for how we can do that.

3407
02:27:02,980 --> 02:27:05,000
Beepo... Beepo is starting a war.

3408
02:27:08,400 --> 02:27:08,940
Let's go.

3409
02:27:10,300 --> 02:27:11,000
Oh no!

3410
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:11,660
I was kidding!

3411
02:27:11,940 --> 02:27:12,440
Beepo!

3412
02:27:12,580 --> 02:27:13,320
Come back!

3413
02:27:17,240 --> 02:27:18,040
Go Beepo!

3414
02:27:18,440 --> 02:27:19,240
Kill them all!

3415
02:27:20,220 --> 02:27:22,440
Would you like to view their diaries for the last time?

3416
02:27:22,620 --> 02:27:23,760
Yeah, I guess we'll see everybody.

3417
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:25,400
Oh wait.

3418
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:26,760
Oh, we saw that one.

3419
02:27:28,200 --> 02:27:29,280
We read that one.

3420
02:27:30,500 --> 02:27:31,600
We read that one.

3421
02:27:32,420 --> 02:27:33,460
And we read that one.

3422
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:33,880
We're good.

3423
02:27:34,820 --> 02:27:35,220
Okay.

3424
02:27:36,860 --> 02:27:38,320
We didn't even write anything!

3425
02:27:39,080 --> 02:27:41,920
Beepo is starting a war to prove that love can bloom on the battlefield.

3426
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:44,260
Let's see how you did!

3427
02:27:46,580 --> 02:27:47,620
53 guys!

3428
02:27:48,280 --> 02:27:48,840
Let's go.

3429
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:52,220
More hats?

3430
02:27:54,260 --> 02:27:56,240
Am I hearing more hats everybody?

3431
02:27:56,760 --> 02:27:58,020
But I really want the scary song.

3432
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:05,240
I'm so close to being able to get both.

3433
02:28:07,720 --> 02:28:08,920
Let's do the song this time.

3434
02:28:12,440 --> 02:28:14,160
And we'll save for the hats.

3435
02:28:18,490 --> 02:28:19,690
A resident's arriving.

3436
02:28:19,890 --> 02:28:20,770
Wait, I don't get to choose!

3437
02:28:21,610 --> 02:28:22,950
Oh gosh, who's coming in?

3438
02:28:23,310 --> 02:28:24,070
A drone?

3439
02:28:24,390 --> 02:28:25,330
More robots!

3440
02:28:25,830 --> 02:28:26,230
Yeah!

3441
02:28:30,570 --> 02:28:31,090
Cute!

3442
02:28:33,190 --> 02:28:33,830
I'm here!

3443
02:28:35,050 --> 02:28:36,350
A resident is arriving.

3444
02:28:36,630 --> 02:28:36,750
Oh.

3445
02:28:42,890 --> 02:28:43,410
Oh!

3446
02:28:43,410 --> 02:28:43,870
Wow!

3447
02:28:47,030 --> 02:28:48,690
Oh gosh!

3448
02:28:50,270 --> 02:28:51,310
It's Noir!

3449
02:28:54,290 --> 02:28:55,570
Oh my gosh!

3450
02:28:58,810 --> 02:29:02,130
They left their little plushie of themselves!

3451
02:29:06,370 --> 02:29:09,170
So sweet!

3452
02:29:10,070 --> 02:29:11,790
Check the memories.

3453
02:29:12,250 --> 02:29:12,610
Oh.

3454
02:29:13,930 --> 02:29:14,290
Hello?

3455
02:29:14,950 --> 02:29:15,810
Sing a song.

3456
02:29:18,190 --> 02:29:18,550
Congrats.

3457
02:29:18,790 --> 02:29:19,970
Now you can make ghost noises.

3458
02:29:20,390 --> 02:29:22,330
Well, I guess you always made that whoosh sound.

3459
02:29:22,450 --> 02:29:23,770
But now you can sing songs for your residents!

3460
02:29:24,470 --> 02:29:26,130
Let's start with a scary song.

3461
02:29:31,130 --> 02:29:33,810
If you sing the song near a resident, it will scare them.

3462
02:29:33,990 --> 02:29:35,190
But that's not always a bad thing.

3463
02:29:35,490 --> 02:29:37,650
For instance, if you see two residents in a room.

3464
02:29:37,730 --> 02:29:38,450
They were where they were.

3465
02:29:38,530 --> 02:29:38,890
Together.

3466
02:29:39,050 --> 02:29:40,890
And you want them to stop talking to each other.

3467
02:29:40,890 --> 02:29:41,090
Oh.

3468
02:29:41,490 --> 02:29:42,290
Use this song.

3469
02:29:42,550 --> 02:29:43,630
It doesn't take any actions.

3470
02:29:43,790 --> 02:29:45,370
So feel free to sing it as much as you want.

3471
02:29:50,350 --> 02:29:53,790
You need at least one resident in the room for this song to take effect.

3472
02:29:53,950 --> 02:29:54,110
Okay.

3473
02:29:56,050 --> 02:29:56,410
Wait.

3474
02:29:56,530 --> 02:29:57,490
Can I sing anything then?

3475
02:30:03,870 --> 02:30:05,010
What else can I sing?

3476
02:30:05,890 --> 02:30:06,250
Um.

3477
02:30:07,310 --> 02:30:07,670
Okay.

3478
02:30:10,490 --> 02:30:11,610
I think you can do it.

3479
02:30:11,690 --> 02:30:12,230
I think you can do it.

3480
02:30:12,670 --> 02:30:12,910
Okay.

3481
02:30:14,750 --> 02:30:15,790
Try it.

3482
02:30:15,810 --> 02:30:16,150
Okay.

3483
02:30:16,910 --> 02:30:17,430
I think you can do it.

3484
02:30:17,430 --> 02:30:17,710
Oh.

3485
02:30:18,030 --> 02:30:18,550
It could be...

3486
02:30:18,550 --> 02:30:22,050
You can do it.

3487
02:30:22,070 --> 02:30:22,390
I think you can do it.

3488
02:30:22,410 --> 02:30:22,490
No.

3489
02:30:24,010 --> 02:30:24,530
Okay.

3490
02:30:26,490 --> 02:30:27,010
I think you can do it.

3491
02:30:27,010 --> 02:30:28,350
I think you can do it.

3492
02:30:29,070 --> 02:30:29,590
Yeah.

3493
02:30:31,330 --> 02:30:32,070
All right.

3494
02:30:32,370 --> 02:30:33,470
So you're probably gonna have a good idea of...

3495
02:30:34,410 --> 02:30:34,930
Yeah, sure.

3496
02:30:34,930 --> 02:30:35,210
Sure.

3497
02:30:36,310 --> 02:30:37,430
Which one is that again?

3498
02:30:41,270 --> 02:30:42,190
Bad apple.

3499
02:30:46,490 --> 02:30:47,690
Left, right, up.

3500
02:30:55,610 --> 02:30:56,830
How does it go though?

3501
02:30:57,150 --> 02:30:58,890
You guys wouldn't be able to tell me, huh?

3502
02:30:59,110 --> 02:30:59,690
Oh no!

3503
02:30:59,830 --> 02:31:00,650
I was gonna scare them!

3504
02:31:00,910 --> 02:31:04,790
Oh my gosh, look at the chocolate... charcoal flavor.

3505
02:31:07,510 --> 02:31:10,050
I should have known you could play the Therament.

3506
02:31:13,930 --> 02:31:14,990
What's the one...

3507
02:31:17,470 --> 02:31:20,150
I'll be honest you guys, I never actually played Ocarina of Time.

3508
02:31:20,890 --> 02:31:23,490
Because I never had an N64.

3509
02:31:24,610 --> 02:31:25,490
Rock celery.

3510
02:31:26,130 --> 02:31:27,150
I never had one.

3511
02:31:28,990 --> 02:31:34,670
I had a friend that I watched play a little bit.

3512
02:31:37,350 --> 02:31:39,050
Aw, aren't Beepo and Apollo so cute?

3513
02:31:39,410 --> 02:31:40,450
I miss them already.

3514
02:31:40,850 --> 02:31:43,070
Oh, did you see what they left on the memories board?

3515
02:31:43,410 --> 02:31:45,530
Oh, wait, they actually left something on the memories board?

3516
02:31:51,100 --> 02:31:51,540
This?

3517
02:31:52,440 --> 02:31:53,480
Oh, I have a relationship!

3518
02:31:53,640 --> 02:31:54,320
Apple hog!

3519
02:31:55,700 --> 02:31:56,880
The couples to defeat.

3520
02:31:57,080 --> 02:31:58,440
The couple across the street.

3521
02:31:58,560 --> 02:32:01,000
The couples that keep saying how cute they are.

3522
02:32:02,620 --> 02:32:03,840
Beepo, what is this list?

3523
02:32:06,060 --> 02:32:07,580
It's the 3DS remake queen.

3524
02:32:07,660 --> 02:32:07,980
I know!

3525
02:32:07,980 --> 02:32:10,600
But that like came out so long ago after, you know?

3526
02:32:14,980 --> 02:32:15,420
Casey!

3527
02:32:15,660 --> 02:32:16,260
Thanks for the gift!

3528
02:32:16,800 --> 02:32:17,580
Don't worry Apollo.

3529
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:21,320
I have analyzed their weaknesses and I'm confident we can defeat them.

3530
02:32:21,940 --> 02:32:23,340
Do we have to defeat them?

3531
02:32:23,480 --> 02:32:24,940
Can't we just go out with them instead?

3532
02:32:28,450 --> 02:32:28,890
Apollo?

3533
02:32:29,570 --> 02:32:31,490
Apollo doesn't just want to be friends with everybody.

3534
02:32:31,830 --> 02:32:33,610
He also wants to be couples with everybody.

3535
02:32:35,110 --> 02:32:36,550
Couples to double date with.

3536
02:32:36,750 --> 02:32:37,550
Every couple.

3537
02:32:37,890 --> 02:32:39,810
Resulting in a higher number of dates with Apollo.

3538
02:32:39,810 --> 02:32:42,790
Oh, I like that list a lot better.

3539
02:32:46,110 --> 02:32:47,230
Number 1!

3540
02:32:48,990 --> 02:32:50,670
Wait, they're so cute.

3541
02:32:54,130 --> 02:32:55,190
They're so cute.

3542
02:32:56,270 --> 02:32:57,630
And then there was the other one.

3543
02:32:58,410 --> 02:32:59,550
The apple hog.

3544
02:33:00,210 --> 02:33:01,270
Dearest Campbell.

3545
02:33:01,550 --> 02:33:02,250
Oh, sorry.

3546
02:33:02,810 --> 02:33:03,770
Dearest Campbell.

3547
02:33:04,270 --> 02:33:05,070
Urgent news.

3548
02:33:05,330 --> 02:33:07,590
I need the nicest outfit you can whip up.

3549
02:33:07,750 --> 02:33:08,810
Need it tonight?

3550
02:33:09,730 --> 02:33:10,250
Thanks.

3551
02:33:10,770 --> 02:33:11,550
Olin, please.

3552
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:13,630
Olin.

3553
02:33:13,750 --> 02:33:14,450
Wait, for tonight?

3554
02:33:14,770 --> 02:33:16,230
I don't know if I can work that quickly.

3555
02:33:16,410 --> 02:33:17,810
How fancy are we talking here?

3556
02:33:19,110 --> 02:33:20,090
Dearest Campbell.

3557
02:33:20,250 --> 02:33:21,170
Very fancy.

3558
02:33:21,350 --> 02:33:23,130
It's a very important occasion.

3559
02:33:24,270 --> 02:33:24,790
What?

3560
02:33:24,890 --> 02:33:25,610
What occasion?

3561
02:33:26,030 --> 02:33:27,450
I don't have it on my calendar.

3562
02:33:27,610 --> 02:33:29,270
I have all of your events on my calendar.

3563
02:33:31,350 --> 02:33:32,330
Dearest Campbell.

3564
02:33:32,750 --> 02:33:34,330
A dinner with you.

3565
02:33:34,330 --> 02:33:38,410
Oh, okay.

3566
02:33:40,570 --> 02:33:41,750
Okay, right on that.

3567
02:33:44,530 --> 02:33:46,650
Is it a vampire outfit?

3568
02:33:58,570 --> 02:34:00,030
It's so cute.

3569
02:34:00,630 --> 02:34:02,330
They're a cosplay queen.

3570
02:34:03,670 --> 02:34:05,590
They're matching even.

3571
02:34:06,050 --> 02:34:07,770
This is so cute.

3572
02:34:08,190 --> 02:34:08,950
Oh my gosh.

3573
02:34:10,930 --> 02:34:12,450
Let's see how Noir is.

3574
02:34:12,450 --> 02:34:13,870
Dear diary.

3575
02:34:14,090 --> 02:34:17,230
This house is about to become a whole lot more fashionable.

3576
02:34:17,490 --> 02:34:21,890
I already have some ideas for how to make this place fabulous.

3577
02:34:22,930 --> 02:34:23,890
Oh la la.

3578
02:34:25,270 --> 02:34:26,250
What about you?

3579
02:34:26,670 --> 02:34:27,190
Ami.

3580
02:34:27,470 --> 02:34:28,310
Dear diary.

3581
02:34:28,410 --> 02:34:29,350
I'm so excited.

3582
02:34:29,450 --> 02:34:31,970
My room has so much space for wild experiments.

3583
02:34:32,470 --> 02:34:33,470
Well, almost.

3584
02:34:33,850 --> 02:34:37,590
Maybe my roommates won't mind me taking up a tad bit more room.

3585
02:34:37,590 --> 02:34:37,590
Dear diary.

3586
02:34:37,590 --> 02:34:37,590
I'm so excited.

3587
02:34:37,590 --> 02:34:39,130
My room has so much space for wild experiments.

3588
02:34:39,130 --> 02:34:39,130
Well, almost.

3589
02:34:39,130 --> 02:34:39,210
Maybe my roommates won't mind me taking up a tad bit more room.

3590
02:34:42,130 --> 02:34:42,770
What is this?

3591
02:34:42,790 --> 02:34:43,150
Cup ramen?

3592
02:34:45,190 --> 02:34:46,230
Literal instant noodles.

3593
02:34:47,790 --> 02:34:48,190
Wowee.

3594
02:34:49,950 --> 02:34:53,010
Well, let's see what debt it is.

3595
02:34:54,390 --> 02:34:56,030
What's your favorite song to sing to your residents?

3596
02:34:56,730 --> 02:34:57,730
What the title says.

3597
02:34:58,430 --> 02:34:59,150
Scary song.

3598
02:34:59,290 --> 02:35:00,770
Because they look so funny when they're scared.

3599
02:35:01,010 --> 02:35:02,650
They'll even run away from the room they're in.

3600
02:35:03,310 --> 02:35:04,670
The romantic song is cute.

3601
02:35:04,830 --> 02:35:07,050
But it only works if you have two residents in the same room.

3602
02:35:08,190 --> 02:35:09,370
The happy song is nice.

3603
02:35:09,530 --> 02:35:13,210
It works on both residents if you sing it to two residents in the same room too.

3604
02:35:13,470 --> 02:35:16,810
I like using the scary song to stop residents from talking to each other.

3605
02:35:17,210 --> 02:35:21,070
I like using the scary song to send residents to the kitchen to talk to each other.

3606
02:35:23,330 --> 02:35:24,570
Obviously the money song.

3607
02:35:24,670 --> 02:35:25,410
It's free money.

3608
02:35:26,470 --> 02:35:28,170
Wait, so you can sing infinitely then?

3609
02:35:28,370 --> 02:35:30,790
You can, but it gets less effective the more you use it.

3610
02:35:30,870 --> 02:35:33,490
It'll go back to full effectiveness the next day.

3611
02:35:33,810 --> 02:35:34,930
There's a money song!

3612
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:39,880
Oh yeah.

3613
02:35:40,120 --> 02:35:41,760
My first couple just moved out.

3614
02:35:43,520 --> 02:35:44,980
OMG I match-maked?

3615
02:35:45,140 --> 02:35:45,860
Match made?

3616
02:35:46,020 --> 02:35:46,920
My first couple?

3617
02:35:47,020 --> 02:35:48,200
And they just moved out together?

3618
02:35:48,420 --> 02:35:49,380
I miss them already.

3619
02:35:50,140 --> 02:35:50,620
Congrats!

3620
02:35:50,960 --> 02:35:51,940
It's always so sweet.

3621
02:35:52,060 --> 02:35:54,220
And there are so many more relationships out there to make.

3622
02:35:54,600 --> 02:35:55,580
You made them happy.

3623
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:57,040
So happy.

3624
02:35:57,180 --> 02:35:57,660
Nice job.

3625
02:35:58,260 --> 02:36:01,020
I cried for ten days after my first couple left.

3626
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:03,700
Did they leave any presents for the manor?

3627
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:05,860
My residents left me cute plushies of themselves.

3628
02:36:06,260 --> 02:36:07,720
Make sure to check the memories board.

3629
02:36:08,800 --> 02:36:10,060
And the kitchen after they move out.

3630
02:36:10,260 --> 02:36:12,080
I can rewatch their whole relationship.

3631
02:36:12,320 --> 02:36:12,800
Oh god.

3632
02:36:12,920 --> 02:36:14,640
Now I'm gonna go cry for ten more days.

3633
02:36:16,100 --> 02:36:16,680
My- oh.

3634
02:36:16,780 --> 02:36:18,160
The conspiracy theory!

3635
02:36:18,480 --> 02:36:18,880
They're back!

3636
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:19,340
They're back!

3637
02:36:19,520 --> 02:36:20,120
My theory.

3638
02:36:21,640 --> 02:36:22,360
Part one.

3639
02:36:23,700 --> 02:36:27,800
Have you ever thought about how weird it is that we are ghost matchmakers?

3640
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:29,000
And for what?

3641
02:36:29,740 --> 02:36:32,320
What if we are in a simulation?

3642
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:33,480
Lol.

3643
02:36:33,540 --> 02:36:34,200
That's so random.

3644
02:36:35,480 --> 02:36:37,260
You really think we're in a simulation?

3645
02:36:37,260 --> 02:36:38,900
Like someone created this world?

3646
02:36:39,560 --> 02:36:40,040
Right?

3647
02:36:40,400 --> 02:36:42,180
Even if someone could make this world?

3648
02:36:42,320 --> 02:36:45,280
Why would they make this and not something cooler?

3649
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:46,320
Huh.

3650
02:36:46,600 --> 02:36:47,840
I never thought about that.

3651
02:36:48,480 --> 02:36:50,680
Hey, at Conspiracy Theory.

3652
02:36:52,320 --> 02:36:54,000
Please keep the forums on topic.

3653
02:36:54,140 --> 02:36:55,460
This is not a place for your theories.

3654
02:36:59,080 --> 02:36:59,880
Ghosts are haters?

3655
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,720
Yeah, there's so many thumbs down on all these perfectly normal responses.

3656
02:37:02,900 --> 02:37:06,520
Well, this person is not contributing to the conversation.

3657
02:37:07,260 --> 02:37:07,960
A simple ghost.

3658
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:10,980
They're just... they're just... you know...

3659
02:37:12,940 --> 02:37:13,760
Chemistry side.

3660
02:37:13,820 --> 02:37:15,520
Record player...

3661
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:16,780
Let's send an email.

3662
02:37:18,080 --> 02:37:18,880
Hello.

3663
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:21,260
If you like...

3664
02:37:22,020 --> 02:37:22,860
Uh oh.

3665
02:37:22,980 --> 02:37:23,700
Streaming?

3666
02:37:26,320 --> 02:37:27,120
Games.

3667
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:30,260
We've launched a new...

3668
02:37:32,460 --> 02:37:33,260
Oh.

3669
02:37:33,300 --> 02:37:34,140
Streaming platform.

3670
02:37:35,220 --> 02:37:36,020
That...

3671
02:37:39,810 --> 02:37:40,330
Uh...

3672
02:37:41,670 --> 02:37:44,110
Has infinite storage space.

3673
02:37:44,630 --> 02:37:49,490
If you like early access, please send us money to join the waiting list.

3674
02:37:53,350 --> 02:37:54,970
Good eep mail message.

3675
02:37:55,130 --> 02:37:56,030
It almost made sense.

3676
02:37:58,990 --> 02:37:59,510
Awesome.

3677
02:38:00,830 --> 02:38:03,050
So I'm guessing we'll get two more people tomorrow?

3678
02:38:03,210 --> 02:38:04,350
Oh, wait, I can sing the song.

3679
02:38:10,650 --> 02:38:11,770
I want to scare them.

3680
02:38:19,640 --> 02:38:20,260
Combo breaker.

3681
02:38:25,030 --> 02:38:25,950
I'm gonna gift this.

3682
02:38:29,350 --> 02:38:32,470
Wait, maybe I shouldn't gift anything yet until we get all new people, right?

3683
02:38:33,030 --> 02:38:33,630
I don't know.

3684
02:38:33,650 --> 02:38:35,730
There might be, like, the perfect match.

3685
02:38:36,010 --> 02:38:38,270
Or they could be the perfect match for each other.

3686
02:38:38,370 --> 02:38:38,990
I don't know.

3687
02:38:39,110 --> 02:38:39,990
I don't know anything.

3688
02:38:40,170 --> 02:38:40,510
Okay.

3689
02:38:41,990 --> 02:38:43,910
Small guy, big goth girl.

3690
02:38:44,830 --> 02:38:45,610
Wait, hold on.

3691
02:38:46,210 --> 02:38:49,030
Small Ami and big goth Mami.

3692
02:38:50,910 --> 02:38:53,110
She's a sheep who never follows the herd.

3693
02:38:54,590 --> 02:38:57,210
She aspires to be the very first flying hamster.

3694
02:38:57,450 --> 02:38:58,870
Oh, she's a hamster!

3695
02:38:59,410 --> 02:39:00,830
She's very solution-oriented.

3696
02:39:01,570 --> 02:39:03,050
Moved out with Olin.

3697
02:39:03,250 --> 02:39:05,610
Wait, what do you mean the current happiness is, like...

3698
02:39:05,610 --> 02:39:05,970
Wait.

3699
02:39:06,190 --> 02:39:07,290
Beeple, are you okay?

3700
02:39:09,470 --> 02:39:10,490
Beeple, what happened to you?

3701
02:39:10,490 --> 02:39:10,930
What's your happiness?

3702
02:39:13,690 --> 02:39:14,650
Hamster song.

3703
02:39:21,750 --> 02:39:24,590
I'm just gonna keep sending emails today, I think.

3704
02:39:25,210 --> 02:39:25,830
Wait, what's this?

3705
02:39:25,910 --> 02:39:26,430
A lucky penny?

3706
02:39:27,350 --> 02:39:28,850
D to die.

3707
02:39:29,930 --> 02:39:30,270
Oh.

3708
02:39:36,050 --> 02:39:37,030
Okay, ready?

3709
02:39:39,910 --> 02:39:41,190
Hot chocolate.

3710
02:39:46,110 --> 02:39:48,350
All these are not so great gifts either.

3711
02:39:49,110 --> 02:39:50,810
Oh wait, but they can do chores at least.

3712
02:39:50,970 --> 02:39:51,590
Eat a snack.

3713
02:39:52,030 --> 02:39:53,270
Wait, buy a new rug.

3714
02:39:53,390 --> 02:39:54,090
This is so noir.

3715
02:39:54,290 --> 02:39:55,590
Fancy and fashionable.

3716
02:39:56,130 --> 02:39:57,730
And then Ami can do this.

3717
02:39:57,870 --> 02:39:58,070
Okay.

3718
02:39:58,170 --> 02:39:58,750
A sign.

3719
02:39:59,410 --> 02:40:01,230
And then let's go do some more emails.

3720
02:40:05,210 --> 02:40:06,990
Blank has been posted on blank.

3721
02:40:07,350 --> 02:40:08,390
Oh my gosh, a butt?

3722
02:40:09,250 --> 02:40:10,210
A computer virus?

3723
02:40:10,350 --> 02:40:10,870
A transaction?

3724
02:40:11,050 --> 02:40:11,590
A big ol' bill?

3725
02:40:11,850 --> 02:40:12,790
An appropriate message!

3726
02:40:13,530 --> 02:40:14,810
You guys, this is scary.

3727
02:40:14,810 --> 02:40:15,750
This is a scary one.

3728
02:40:16,130 --> 02:40:17,930
I want a butt so bad.

3729
02:40:21,430 --> 02:40:22,030
Yeah!

3730
02:40:22,350 --> 02:40:24,550
A butt has been posted on...

3731
02:40:26,810 --> 02:40:27,750
Your butt!

3732
02:40:28,170 --> 02:40:31,810
If you want this removed, please reply with monies and...

3733
02:40:33,990 --> 02:40:34,590
Gold!

3734
02:40:35,410 --> 02:40:36,570
Yes, save me.

3735
02:40:38,910 --> 02:40:39,510
No!

3736
02:40:39,610 --> 02:40:40,390
Not my butt!

3737
02:40:42,690 --> 02:40:43,290
No!

3738
02:40:53,470 --> 02:40:53,550
Not my butt!

3739
02:40:53,550 --> 02:40:53,890
No!

3740
02:40:53,890 --> 02:40:53,890
Not my butt!

3741
02:40:53,890 --> 02:40:54,630
No!

3742
02:40:54,890 --> 02:40:56,090
Not my butt!

3743
02:40:59,770 --> 02:41:00,830
Oh my god!

3744
02:41:04,190 --> 02:41:04,990
New people!

3745
02:41:05,130 --> 02:41:05,890
New people come in!

3746
02:41:06,350 --> 02:41:07,150
It was okay.

3747
02:41:07,390 --> 02:41:08,770
But this one was good.

3748
02:41:09,070 --> 02:41:09,450
Yeah, yeah.

3749
02:41:11,130 --> 02:41:12,490
Fancy and fashionable.

3750
02:41:15,470 --> 02:41:15,990
Okay.

3751
02:41:16,790 --> 02:41:17,870
Not my butt.

3752
02:41:18,610 --> 02:41:19,350
New people!

3753
02:41:19,550 --> 02:41:20,490
A resident is arriving!

3754
02:41:20,830 --> 02:41:21,410
Who is this?

3755
02:41:21,510 --> 02:41:21,810
Who is this?

3756
02:41:21,810 --> 02:41:23,270
It's...

3757
02:41:25,730 --> 02:41:26,930
Elephant!

3758
02:41:29,470 --> 02:41:30,210
Oh no!

3759
02:41:30,470 --> 02:41:31,110
They're dumb!

3760
02:41:32,570 --> 02:41:33,170
Felix!

3761
02:41:34,470 --> 02:41:35,790
A resident has arrived!

3762
02:41:36,010 --> 02:41:36,710
Penguin!

3763
02:41:42,910 --> 02:41:45,190
Okay, I guess...

3764
02:41:48,050 --> 02:41:49,250
It's Wobbles!

3765
02:41:52,150 --> 02:41:53,570
Wobbles loves...

3766
02:41:56,650 --> 02:41:57,210
Wow.

3767
02:41:58,450 --> 02:41:59,010
Fancy.

3768
02:41:59,990 --> 02:42:00,550
Fountain.

3769
02:42:04,110 --> 02:42:05,850
Oh my gosh, they're all so cute.

3770
02:42:06,230 --> 02:42:06,790
No, no!

3771
02:42:08,410 --> 02:42:09,250
Dear diary.

3772
02:42:09,490 --> 02:42:09,970
Hi!

3773
02:42:10,130 --> 02:42:11,050
It's a new journal.

3774
02:42:11,270 --> 02:42:12,770
So excited to meet everyone and...

3775
02:42:12,770 --> 02:42:13,250
Oops.

3776
02:42:13,450 --> 02:42:13,990
Great.

3777
02:42:14,190 --> 02:42:16,390
I spilled tomato sauce all over the first page.

3778
02:42:16,650 --> 02:42:17,490
Sorry, diary.

3779
02:42:19,150 --> 02:42:19,910
It's okay.

3780
02:42:20,230 --> 02:42:22,850
I guess even penguins eat spaghetti.

3781
02:42:24,150 --> 02:42:25,550
What about you, Felix?

3782
02:42:26,410 --> 02:42:27,190
It's your diary.

3783
02:42:27,410 --> 02:42:28,790
Found this empty book in my room.

3784
02:42:28,970 --> 02:42:30,030
Who buys empty books?

3785
02:42:30,230 --> 02:42:30,710
Weird.

3786
02:42:30,890 --> 02:42:33,090
Well, I'm gonna write in it and finish it for them.

3787
02:42:33,790 --> 02:42:35,390
I bet Wobbles will love that snowman.

3788
02:42:35,450 --> 02:42:36,190
I agree!

3789
02:42:36,450 --> 02:42:37,010
I agree!

3790
02:42:37,190 --> 02:42:37,650
I agree!

3791
02:42:38,170 --> 02:42:39,230
What is this, though?

3792
02:42:40,450 --> 02:42:41,410
A xylophone.

3793
02:42:41,950 --> 02:42:42,890
A woodblock.

3794
02:42:45,530 --> 02:42:47,970
Probably named by the same person who named the triangle.

3795
02:42:50,890 --> 02:42:51,370
Noot!

3796
02:42:51,370 --> 02:42:51,650
Noot!

3797
02:42:51,750 --> 02:42:52,210
Oh!

3798
02:42:52,350 --> 02:42:53,910
Some fancy tea!

3799
02:42:55,010 --> 02:42:55,490
Oh!

3800
02:42:57,290 --> 02:42:57,730
Okay.

3801
02:42:57,890 --> 02:42:58,530
Well, guys.

3802
02:42:58,550 --> 02:43:00,010
I think I might actually end it here.

3803
02:43:01,590 --> 02:43:02,030
Because...

3804
02:43:03,830 --> 02:43:05,730
I am feeling a little...

3805
02:43:06,390 --> 02:43:06,830
Oof.

3806
02:43:09,510 --> 02:43:09,950
Um...

3807
02:43:10,390 --> 02:43:11,410
I'm gonna go...

3808
02:43:12,190 --> 02:43:12,910
Grab some...

3809
02:43:12,910 --> 02:43:13,770
I actually have medicine.

3810
02:43:14,010 --> 02:43:15,110
It's like a drinkable medicine.

3811
02:43:15,210 --> 02:43:16,390
I have to put it in, um...

3812
02:43:16,390 --> 02:43:17,170
In the water.

3813
02:43:19,510 --> 02:43:19,950
So...

3814
02:43:20,470 --> 02:43:20,910
Um...

3815
02:43:20,910 --> 02:43:21,630
Yeah!

3816
02:43:22,190 --> 02:43:24,770
Thank you guys for watching and hanging out with me.

3817
02:43:24,810 --> 02:43:25,510
And this is so much fun.

3818
02:43:25,530 --> 02:43:25,910
It's so cute.

3819
02:43:27,010 --> 02:43:27,490
Um...

3820
02:43:28,830 --> 02:43:29,310
And...

3821
02:43:29,310 --> 02:43:29,610
Yeah!

3822
02:43:31,170 --> 02:43:32,250
Almost three hours.

3823
02:43:32,350 --> 02:43:32,490
Oh!

3824
02:43:32,510 --> 02:43:32,990
You're so right!

3825
02:43:33,250 --> 02:43:33,670
Yeah!

3826
02:43:33,730 --> 02:43:34,450
Almost three hours.

3827
02:43:34,510 --> 02:43:34,910
For real.

3828
02:43:35,030 --> 02:43:35,370
So...

3829
02:43:35,370 --> 02:43:35,650
Hmm.

3830
02:43:36,930 --> 02:43:37,790
Thank you guys!

3831
02:43:37,910 --> 02:43:39,730
This is such a cute and silly game.

3832
02:43:39,930 --> 02:43:40,310
Um...

3833
02:43:40,310 --> 02:43:41,190
I had a lot of fun with it.

3834
02:43:41,270 --> 02:43:41,790
Of course...

3835
02:43:41,790 --> 02:43:42,310
You know...

3836
02:43:42,310 --> 02:43:44,070
I feel most in my element when I'm a ghost.

3837
02:43:44,230 --> 02:43:44,690
And...

3838
02:43:45,550 --> 02:43:46,030
Um...

3839
02:43:46,030 --> 02:43:47,410
I've never done matchmaking before.

3840
02:43:47,530 --> 02:43:48,010
But...

3841
02:43:48,010 --> 02:43:48,410
Maybe...

3842
02:43:48,410 --> 02:43:50,430
I really have a knack for it.

3843
02:43:51,470 --> 02:43:52,170
I think...

3844
02:43:52,170 --> 02:43:52,430
I...

3845
02:43:52,430 --> 02:43:53,090
Maybe...

3846
02:43:53,090 --> 02:43:53,590
Um...

3847
02:43:53,590 --> 02:43:54,290
Like...

3848
02:43:55,530 --> 02:43:55,870
I'm a real professional.

3849
02:43:56,430 --> 02:43:56,830
Probably.

3850
02:43:58,170 --> 02:43:59,130
But thank you guys!

3851
02:43:59,290 --> 02:44:00,390
Thanks for hanging out with me!

3852
02:44:00,770 --> 02:44:03,030
Thank you for all the donuts and super chats!

3853
02:44:03,290 --> 02:44:03,770
Cute game.

3854
02:44:03,850 --> 02:44:04,370
Thanks for the stream.

3855
02:44:04,530 --> 02:44:05,150
Thanks make me!

3856
02:44:05,450 --> 02:44:06,630
Thank you guys so much.

3857
02:44:07,190 --> 02:44:08,770
Really, really, really appreciate it.

3858
02:44:09,570 --> 02:44:09,970
Chuu!

3859
02:44:10,250 --> 02:44:11,170
Such a cute game.

3860
02:44:11,370 --> 02:44:12,390
I hope you can stream it...

3861
02:44:12,930 --> 02:44:13,330
So...

3862
02:44:13,770 --> 02:44:14,170
Somewhere...

3863
02:44:14,170 --> 02:44:15,310
When you want something chill.

3864
02:44:15,410 --> 02:44:15,590
Yeah!

3865
02:44:15,990 --> 02:44:16,630
Thank you.

3866
02:44:16,650 --> 02:44:17,010
Thank you.

3867
02:44:17,850 --> 02:44:19,030
Very fun little game.

3868
02:44:19,230 --> 02:44:19,790
Thank you, Minto.

3869
02:44:19,910 --> 02:44:20,290
Thank you!

3870
02:44:21,170 --> 02:44:21,570
Yeah!

3871
02:44:21,610 --> 02:44:22,370
We have so much...

3872
02:44:22,370 --> 02:44:22,930
Um...

3873
02:44:22,930 --> 02:44:24,050
I wish we could see the shop.

3874
02:44:24,910 --> 02:44:25,490
Hold on.

3875
02:44:25,490 --> 02:44:25,510
Let's see...

3876
02:44:25,510 --> 02:44:25,610
Was it...

3877
02:44:25,610 --> 02:44:26,890
Was it under eye here?

3878
02:44:30,910 --> 02:44:33,330
I wish there was a way to see like the tree.

3879
02:44:33,550 --> 02:44:34,010
You know?

3880
02:44:34,370 --> 02:44:38,630
So that I could see what things we still needed to unlock.

3881
02:44:40,530 --> 02:44:41,050
But...

3882
02:44:41,050 --> 02:44:41,230
Um...

3883
02:44:41,230 --> 02:44:41,950
There was a lot...

3884
02:44:43,570 --> 02:44:45,070
To unlock still.

3885
02:44:45,250 --> 02:44:45,730
So...

3886
02:44:45,730 --> 02:44:45,990
Hmm!

3887
02:44:46,910 --> 02:44:47,430
Um...

3888
02:44:48,050 --> 02:44:50,910
Do you have any tips for Wisp to Wisp love?

3889
02:44:54,530 --> 02:44:55,050
Hmm...

3890
02:44:55,050 --> 02:44:55,490
Higher...

3891
02:44:55,490 --> 02:44:56,490
Higher than...

3892
02:44:58,780 --> 02:44:59,260
Wow!

3893
02:44:59,320 --> 02:45:00,500
This time, thanks to the five gifted!

3894
02:45:01,540 --> 02:45:02,640
Will you be streaming tomorrow?

3895
02:45:02,740 --> 02:45:02,940
No!

3896
02:45:03,100 --> 02:45:05,320
I will be putting out my schedule like...

3897
02:45:05,320 --> 02:45:06,220
Very soon.

3898
02:45:06,360 --> 02:45:06,780
Like probably...

3899
02:45:06,780 --> 02:45:07,740
Maybe like right after this.

3900
02:45:09,440 --> 02:45:09,920
Um...

3901
02:45:09,920 --> 02:45:11,660
But I won't be streaming tomorrow.

3902
02:45:11,980 --> 02:45:12,460
So...

3903
02:45:12,460 --> 02:45:13,160
Yeah.

3904
02:45:13,280 --> 02:45:15,740
Looking forward to whatever ships you craft next.

3905
02:45:15,800 --> 02:45:17,240
Both in game and IRL.

3906
02:45:19,020 --> 02:45:19,500
I...

3907
02:45:19,500 --> 02:45:20,060
IRL?

3908
02:45:20,300 --> 02:45:20,760
Ashes?

3909
02:45:21,320 --> 02:45:21,800
Ashes?

3910
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:23,740
Try Princess?

3911
02:45:23,800 --> 02:45:24,340
Thank you!

3912
02:45:26,360 --> 02:45:26,840
Hi...

3913
02:45:26,860 --> 02:45:28,660
How much does a Wisp cost?

3914
02:45:29,040 --> 02:45:29,360
Oh...

3915
02:45:29,360 --> 02:45:29,740
I mean...

3916
02:45:29,740 --> 02:45:30,760
You hire them...

3917
02:45:30,760 --> 02:45:31,740
You could say...

3918
02:45:31,740 --> 02:45:32,000
Um...

3919
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:33,080
Hire them to like...

3920
02:45:33,080 --> 02:45:34,600
Rub your feet...

3921
02:45:34,600 --> 02:45:36,280
Hire them to...

3922
02:45:36,900 --> 02:45:37,460
Um...

3923
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:39,000
Hire them...

3924
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:46,620
Hire someone to stand next to your hot water boiler and press the button to turn it on whenever you need the hot water?

3925
02:45:48,660 --> 02:45:49,220
Tuna?

3926
02:45:49,720 --> 02:45:50,280
Wait...

3927
02:45:50,280 --> 02:45:51,000
What is Tuna doing?

3928
02:45:51,980 --> 02:45:53,120
What did Tuna do?

3929
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:57,680
Wait...

3930
02:45:57,680 --> 02:45:57,860
You guys...

3931
02:45:57,860 --> 02:45:58,040

3932
02:45:59,920 --> 02:46:00,900

3933
02:46:01,280 --> 02:46:01,900
Oh...

3935
02:46:02,500 --> 02:46:02,860
Oh...

3937
02:46:15,620 --> 02:46:17,120

3938
02:46:17,120 --> 02:46:17,340
Yeah...

3939
02:46:17,340 --> 02:46:17,760
The ship...

3940
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:19,280
The Tuna Maple ship name...

3941
02:46:19,280 --> 02:46:19,780

3942
02:46:19,780 --> 02:46:20,300

3946
02:46:24,440 --> 02:46:25,920
Oimo gave it to me...

3947
02:46:26,580 --> 02:46:27,200

3957
02:46:37,420 --> 02:46:39,620
Several people gave me some...

3958
02:46:39,620 --> 02:46:40,660

02:47:34,060 --> 02:47:34,800
Nanoboys...

3991
02:47:34,800 --> 02:47:35,240
Nanoboys...

3992
02:47:36,280 --> 02:47:36,880
Nanoboys...

3993
02:47:36,880 --> 02:47:39,520
Wait, that's the first time I heard that one.

3994
02:47:54,550 --> 02:47:55,470
It's a real one.

3995
02:47:55,650 --> 02:47:56,030
Really?

3996
02:48:02,120 --> 02:48:02,600
Help?

3997
02:48:02,980 --> 02:48:04,420
Are you guys actually...

3998
02:48:08,220 --> 02:48:08,860
It's real?

3999
02:48:09,120 --> 02:48:09,860
Wait, it's real real?

4000
02:48:16,410 --> 02:48:17,070
Oh no.

02:48:17,330 --> 02:48:17,890
Oh wait.

4002
02:48:18,230 --> 02:48:19,030
Nanoboy is real.

4003
02:48:19,730 --> 02:48:20,950
I don't understand this.

4004
02:48:20,950 --> 02:48:24,550
People... just people in the chat shipping each other.

4005
02:48:24,830 --> 02:48:25,870
Don't worry about it.

4006
02:48:27,970 --> 02:48:28,410
Real.

4007
02:48:29,290 --> 02:48:30,010
It's real?

4008
02:48:30,710 --> 02:48:31,950
Are you guys actually...

4009
02:48:34,170 --> 02:48:34,730
It's real.

4010
02:48:34,830 --> 02:48:35,910
They're... wait, they're divorced.

4011
02:48:37,630 --> 02:48:39,210
When I get you...

4012
02:48:39,790 --> 02:48:40,450
I'm leaving.

4013
02:48:40,630 --> 02:48:42,850
You guys go do your own weird things in the Discord, okay?

4014
02:48:44,330 --> 02:48:44,770
No.

4015
02:48:45,230 --> 02:48:48,070
You guys go do your own weird things in the Discord, okay?

4016
02:48:49,590 --> 02:48:50,030
Okay.

4017
02:48:50,310 --> 02:48:50,930
Thanks guys.

4018
02:48:50,950 --> 02:48:52,070
Thank you.

4019
02:48:53,800 --> 02:48:54,490
Bye bye.

4020
02:48:54,610 --> 02:48:55,430
Bye bye.

4021
02:48:55,530 --> 02:48:58,950
Suddenly see more.

4022
02:48:59,530 --> 02:49:01,470
Suddenly see more.

4023
02:49:02,510 --> 02:49:04,050
Also Pirate5.

4024
02:49:07,710 --> 02:49:09,030
Pirate5, I see you.

4025
02:49:09,190 --> 02:49:11,270
Guess you're super natural at this.

4026
02:49:14,010 --> 02:49:15,810
Get out of here.
