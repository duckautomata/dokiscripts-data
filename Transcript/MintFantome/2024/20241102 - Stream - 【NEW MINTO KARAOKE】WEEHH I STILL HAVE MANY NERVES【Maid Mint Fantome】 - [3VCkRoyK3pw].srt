1
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,960
Oh, there we go.

2
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,070
Oh gosh, that's still weird.

3
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,390
It's still weird.

4
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,950
I think I might like this.

5
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,290
Hello!

6
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:17,760
Lampy!

7
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,620
Thanks for the gift.

8
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,100
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

9
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,940
Karaoke today!

10
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,760
Oh gosh, I was so...

11
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,860
I was like, oh, you know, what's...

12
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,520
Like, a good way to show off my...

13
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
My face.

14
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,340
You know, karaoke I think maybe is a good way.

15
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,960
Is it English or Japanese karaoke?

16
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,660
Whatever!

17
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,260
Whatever I want.

18
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,340
Peanutbutterbutterpuffs, welcome to membership!

19
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,340
Ducky!

20
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

21
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,300
But I...

22
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,520
I was like, what should I do to show off my face?

23
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,640
And I was like, I could do the 3D...

24
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,460
Not 3D, sorry, the karaoke.

25
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,520
But...

26
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,000
I didn't think at all what to sing.

27
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,580
I didn't...

28
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,880
I have no idea.

29
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,580
So...

30
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,300
It's...

31
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,880
It's a mystery.

32
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,300
Raymac, thanks for the 5 gifted!

33
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,400
But thank you guys for being here.

34
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,700
Thank you, thank you.

35
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,040
Nice nude drips.

36
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,160
Thank you!

37
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,680
I'll just sing whatever I want.

38
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,160
I think I have...

39
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,380
I have my switch set up in case I want to do...

40
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,280
Japanese songs.

41
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,820
And of course I have the English.

42
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,240
English songs are probably the easier ones for me to just...

43
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,980
Search up, you know.

44
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,680
You're pretty cute.

45
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,460
I feel like I'm stuck in like this...

46
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,160
I'm stuck in a...

47
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,520
In a trap.

48
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,800
Because...

49
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,440
I don't want you guys to call me cute.

50
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,700
But...

51
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,820
If I say don't call me cute, that's...

52
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,520
It feels like that's insulting...

53
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,660
Ayami mama's art.

54
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,960
So...

55
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,520
You have to say...

56
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,480
What?

57
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,580
It's complicated.

58
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,860
It's complicated.

59
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,860
It's complicated.

60
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,260
Deluran, thanks for the 10 gifted!

61
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,880
Thank you.

62
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:28,960
Thank you.

63
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,520
I don't remember if we've ever done any maid cafe songs.

64
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,700
I would love to request Aikome Forever or Dreaming Passport maybe.

65
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,140
Funny thing...

66
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,780
Dreaming Passport...

67
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,880
Dreaming... Dreaming Passport...

68
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,720
Doesn't really...

69
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,780
I don't know if I...

70
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,140
I don't know if there...

71
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,800
I don't think it has an instrumental.

72
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,280
Micmac, thanks for the 5 gifted!

73
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,660
Notorious BSJ, thanks for the 5 gifted!

74
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,860
Ayami's art is cute.

75
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,120
Yeah!

76
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,400
You can say that.

77
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,180
You can say Ayami's art is so cute.

78
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,160
You can say Ayami mama's art...

79
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,720
Oh my god.

80
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,040
Saikou kawaii.

81
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,460
Ayami mama's art.

82
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,280
Even though...

83
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,820
She was...

84
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,440
She was streaming yesterday.

85
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,340
After my debut.

86
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,420
And she was talking about me.

87
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,280
And she was just like...

88
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,460
But if there's no opai...

89
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,180
I must charge more.

90
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,460
Because I'm not...

91
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,100
Because I'm not comfortable withdrawing smaller chests.

92
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,360
Sensei!

93
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,940
Actually, I don't think I've ever shown this before.

94
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,300
But I have something I want to show real quick.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,120
I don't think I've ever shown this before though.

96
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,980
Hold on, give me a second.

97
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,500
I found it earlier.

98
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,920
Because I was just like...

99
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,940
I was like...

100
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,240
This is always how it's been.

101
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,420
I just got...

102
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,680
Everybody got gaslit.

103
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,540
Basically.

104
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,720
Hold on.

105
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,800
One sec.

106
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,940
You're a soup.

107
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,800
You're a soup.

108
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,200
Thank you.

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,980
Okay, I covered up my ugly handwriting earlier.

110
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,800
Because I was like, I don't want you guys to see that.

111
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,840
And I'm kind of actually really embarrassed to...

112
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,460
You guys can maybe tell me how accurate this is.

113
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,100
So this is what I first sent to KJR Mama.

114
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,880
When I was first telling her how I wanted to look.

115
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,180
So as you can see, this is the Google Doc.

116
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,860
It was from...

117
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,180
I looked, I think it said it was...

118
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,040
It was like...

119
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,480
March.

120
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,440
March or April 2020.

121
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,280
So...

122
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,860
You can see...

123
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,860
You can see...

124
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,200
Things are kind of...

125
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,640
Oh wait, it's a little cropped one.

126
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,620
Things have not changed so much maybe.

127
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,280
But I'm really embarrassed about my personality.

128
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,760
Why did I write that?

129
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,020
What are you talking about?

130
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,680
I'm a genius.

131
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,940
I'm a genius, what are you talking about?

132
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,320
But I also pointed out things that I was like...

133
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,580
Okay, this has to say...

134
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,300
Or this I want, this I want, this I want.

135
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,280
Look at this.

136
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,340
Do you see this?

137
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,040
Hold on.

138
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,380
Appearance.

139
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,190
It was always...

140
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,710
Always...

141
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,670
Always...

142
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,690
Like this!

143
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,310
Always like this!

144
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,150
It was always like this!

145
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,170
And then I had like example haircuts and stuff.

146
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,450
I was like...

147
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,130
And then a hokey.

148
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,990
And then my hitai kakushi.

149
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,150
I don't know why I wrote ghost.

150
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,790
I think I sent this to...

151
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,990
To other artists as well.

152
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,330
Because before I found KJR Mama...

153
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,690
I was looking for other artists and some people were like...

154
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,010
Oh sorry, can't do vtuber model.

155
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:32,790
So...

156
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,350
I was like...

157
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:34,770
You know.

158
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,010
I don't know what this means.

159
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,690
Legs can be a little more active.

160
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,650
I don't know what that means.

161
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,170
I don't know, I'm active apparently.

162
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,550
But I really wanted the...

163
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,450
Look, I even have...

164
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,430
Oh my gosh.

165
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,790
Wait, my ushi right here, that's peace-chan.

166
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:55,910
Active.

167
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,010
So...

168
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,010
Yeah, everybody can shut the hell up.

169
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,590
Being like...

170
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,930
Oh, I think she got smarter.

171
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:06,590
No.

172
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,790
It was always this way.

173
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,990
It was always this way.

174
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,790
From the very start.

175
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,630
From the very beginning.

176
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,280
But I think I'm still...

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,520
Average.

178
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,960
Probably.

179
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,540
I don't know.

180
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,380
It doesn't really matter.

181
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,660
What matters is...

182
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,020
My pointy ears.

183
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,560
That's all that matters.

184
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,400
Is my fang smaller?

185
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,660
No, I don't think so.

186
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,460
Actually...

187
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,480
I made it a point because...

188
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,460
Originally, it was just going to be...

189
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:02,900
Flesh fang.

190
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,460
Because that's kind of Ayami Mama's...

191
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,240
Specialty, I'd say.

192
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,060
But...

193
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,620
I said I wanted both.

194
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,120
Because I've always had the tooth fang.

195
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,220
I made that kind of clear.

196
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,320
I was like, I must have...

197
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,740
I wanted to have, of course...

198
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,020
Ayami Mama's style.

199
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,360
So that's why I kept the flesh fang.

200
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,360
But...

201
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,860
Then I was like, I must have a tooth fang too.

202
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,640
Ayami is number one, mom.

203
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,000
I think so too!

204
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,980
I'm so happy.

205
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,380
How does that work?

206
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,510
It's just my fang, but...

207
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,560
Sticking out.

208
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,700
Kind of.

209
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,780
It's an anime thing, don't...

210
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,700
You humans would not understand.

211
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,700
Flang.

212
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,860
It's a flang.

213
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,880
It's just a flang.

214
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,500
It's a flang.

215
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,460
Yeah, so...

216
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,460
You 3D humans...

217
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,020
Don't understand the workings.

218
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,280
I think.

219
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,460
No, you don't get it.

220
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,340
Will we ever see Spaghetti-chan again?

221
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:31,640
Who?

222
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,180
I don't know anyone by that name.

223
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,360
Spaghetti-chan?

224
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,140
That's weird.

225
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,360
Why is her name Spaghetti?

226
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,120
You guys are being so weird!

227
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,400
You guys are being so weird!

228
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,280
What do you mean?

229
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,140
Rest in pasta?

230
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,560
Like my dinner?

231
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,160
Spaghetti?

232
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,040
I had spaghetti the other night.

233
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,840
For food.

234
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,580
Rule 6?

235
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,420
What's rule 6?

236
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,040
Wait, is that the... Wait, I don't remember my own rules.

237
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,580
I don't remember my own rules.

238
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,040
Wiped from the history books.

239
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,270
I do not know.

240
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,250
I do not know.

241
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:38,930
Anyway.

242
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,330
It's karaoke.

243
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,990
What should I start with?

244
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:46,750
I don't know.

245
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,490
I don't know what to even start with.

246
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,550
With my Oshi, anything is possible.

247
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,770
Wow, what a dumb pun.

248
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:11,110
Not sure my mom understands what Vtubers are, but she told me to give you $10 and tell you she says hi.

249
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,310
JB's mom!

250
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,730
Hello!

251
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,070
Thank you!

252
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,510
Why such a hi about?

253
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,670
Your mom is such an enabler.

254
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,930
Could you possibly sing a Detective Conan song?

255
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,430
Zard!

256
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,410
There's only one truth!

257
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,470
A Zard song.

258
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,850
I've sung Zard before.

259
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,980
I would have to remember some of their other ones.

260
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,520
She was a true patriot.

261
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,910
Congrats on 3.0.

262
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:56,630
Thank you!

263
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,670
Since Shimiko is now technically your sister, any chance for some BA song?

264
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,230
I know, isn't that kind of crazy?

265
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,230
I'm kind of sisters with...

266
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,530
With...

267
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,230
Shimiko.

268
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,150
From Blue Archive.

269
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,890
I did enter a pretty big family, huh?

270
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,990
Any songs stuck in your head lately?

271
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,280
I...

272
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,280
I'm gonna play...

273
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,280
Actually, one thing I've been...

274
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,740
Don't say Monster Mash.

275
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,200
No!

276
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,940
Monster Mash!

277
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,360
That's for Halloween!

278
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,240
It's... It's November 1st!

279
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,720
Oh my gosh, what's some fall songs?

280
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,780
Fall...

281
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,060
What's a fall song?

282
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,160
It's Christmas!

283
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,820
Ne... Wait, wait.

284
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,000
No, hold on, hold on.

285
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:13,880
Mariah Carey!

286
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,980
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

287
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,330
She's alive.

288
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,450
She's always been alive!

289
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,990
She's just defrosted.

290
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,710
She was in a catatonic state.

291
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,250
Frozen tonic state.

292
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:38,730
I think.

293
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,630
That's how it works.

294
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:41,750
Maybe.

295
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:44,590
Alright.

296
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,430
There's one song actually.

297
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,690
Let me see if they have it.

298
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,950
They probably do.

299
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:50,970
That...

300
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,550
I've been listening.

301
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,710
Honestly, I meant to...

302
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,630
I meant to plug this last night.

303
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:56,750
Hot dog.

304
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,010
Oh!

305
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,050
Hot dog!

306
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,670
It's all 19 minutes of Alice's Restaurant.

307
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,290
What's that?

308
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,590
Wait, I think I know that actually.

309
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:13,970
Oh, wait!

310
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,770
I... Wait.

311
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,890
I can't sing it in Spanish though.

312
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,460
I'll try this song.

313
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,040
Wait, this might be way too sad though for the very beginning song.

314
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:39,800
Maybe.

315
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,500
Oh well.

316
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:42,980
Actually...

317
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,060
Yeah, I'll just go...

318
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,880
This might be so sad though for the first song.

319
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,560
Sad first is good?

320
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,340
Okay.

321
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,900
I've never sung this one.

322
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,620
It's quite short.

323
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,560
Actually, I don't know...

324
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,880
I don't know the full version.

325
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,100
It's fine.

326
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,380
Let me know how the audio is.

327
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,120
Ah!

328
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:58,580
Remember me Though I have to say goodbye Remember me Don't let it make you cry For even if I'm far away I hold you in my heart I sing a secret song to you Each night we are apart Remember me Though I have to travel far Remember me Each time you hear a sad guitar Know that I'm with you The only way that I can be

329
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,600
Oh, I forgot to setlist.

330
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,640
One second.

331
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,140
Not spooky setlist anymore.

332
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,920
Just setlist.

333
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,600
Remember me.

334
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,020
Though I have to travel far.

335
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,660
Remember me.

336
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,920
This next song.

337
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,560
Thank you.

338
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,740
Miss Denial.

339
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,620
Denial is not just a river in Egypt.

340
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,680
You as a person are cute.

341
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,260
In addition to Ayami- No!

342
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,380
You cannot say...

343
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,940
Thank you!

344
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,940
Thank you for the hokuto.

345
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,220
Congratulations on a successful re-debut with your new model.

346
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,440
Whisper proud of you, Minto.

347
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,240
Thank you!

348
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,880
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

349
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,040
Thank you so much!

350
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,780
Oh my gosh.

351
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:38,920
I'm gonna sing the next song, but I might mess it up a little bit.

352
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,340
We're still in warm-up, it's fine.

353
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,580
I'm surprised Ayami-mama didn't give you big honka-badonkas.

354
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,860
She has- You guys, just think of it.

355
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,660
I'm extending her artistic range.

356
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,620
She has to be able to draw all sorts of body types, okay?

357
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:04,140
I'm extending her- She says I don't draw smaller chests often, so it's just me helping her out as an artist.

358
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,700
It's me helping her out as an artist.

359
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:16,840
But I also told her if she ever wanted to, she can, so you might see it in the future.

360
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,020
Who knows, she might have some funky doujinshi or something about me.

361
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,600
I gave her full permission.

362
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:26,920
Yeah.

363
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,090
Just more ectoplasm or something, probably.

364
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,490
Okidoki.

365
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,690
Like I said, I might scuff this.

366
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,490
Who cares?

367
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,050
Who cares?

368
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,330
I don't care!

369
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:55,250
Oh, kindly requesting the greatest song ever to be sung and featured in Zash- Not the Chi-Chi-Chi-Oppai!

370
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:01,470
I don't- How does it go again?

371
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,570
I don't even remember.

372
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,150
Sing Doraemon.

373
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,130
Main theme.

374
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,770
I don't know the Doraemon song.

375
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,050
Namtran!

376
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:14,910
Welcome to membership.

377
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:15,590
Thank you!

378
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,910
Oppai boing boing.

379
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,610
Chi-Chi-Chi-Oppai boing boing.

380
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:26,910
Ok, I'm singing now, but it's not about Oppai, I'm really sorry.

381
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,130
It's actually kind of a wholesome song, maybe.

382
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,570
It's by Laifei.

383
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,300
Let's see if the sound will be good.

384
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,660
I'm tired when there's no one else around.

385
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,180
Me and you and awkward silence.

386
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,360
Don't you dare look at me that way.

387
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:10,120
I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same.

388
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,460
Oh, the burning pain.

389
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,680
Listening to you harp on Balsam Moon.

390
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,640
Soulmate, she's so perfect, blah blah blah blah.

391
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,860
How I wish you'll wake up one day.

392
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,400
Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say.

393
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:45,000
That when I talk to you, a cubit walks right through and shoots an arrow through my heart.

394
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And I sound like a fool, but don't you feel it to confess I loved you from the start.

395
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,980
I don't know the ad-libs.

396
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,000
What's a girl to do?

397
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:29,120
Lying on my bed staring into the blue.

398
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:37,320
Unrequited, terrifying, love is driving me a bit insane.

399
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,340
Have to get this off my chest, I'm telling you today.

400
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:54,500
That when I talk to you, a cubit walks right through and shoots an arrow through my heart.

401
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:07,000
And I sound like a fool, but don't you feel it to confess I loved you from the start.

402
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,020
Confess I loved you, just thinking of you.

403
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,360
I know I'm

404
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,620
the star.

405
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,180
Yeah!

406
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,420
Oh, I forgot to show the setlist, my bad.

407
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,060
That was from the start.

408
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,620
I think it's Lai Fai.

409
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,380
Thanks for the 10 gifts!

410
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,640
Thank you!

411
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,900
Stop!

412
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,020
Thank you!

413
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,260
Why did I do that?

414
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,600
The backing was a bit loud.

415
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,260
I tried adjusting it...

416
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,260
While... I think actually... Hold on, I think I...

417
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,660
Changed it...

418
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,880
Before, that's why.

419
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,780
No, I know the instrumental was loud!

420
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,320
Thank you!

421
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,760
Yeah, I saw someone comment while... And it also sounded loud to me.

422
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,360
When I was singing.

423
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,440
Was it still loud towards the end though?

424
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,600
Should've been okay at the end.

425
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,760
Everybody by Backstreet Boys.

426
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,760
Everybody!

427
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,200
Yeah!

428
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,980
Rock your body!

429
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,360
Caught me off guard and I love your singing.

430
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,380
Thank you!

431
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,480
Will this be archived?

432
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,660
No, it's archived.

433
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,000
It's archived.

434
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,670
It's been a minute since I've done...

435
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,740
Since I've done karaoke, so...

436
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,280
I didn't know I liked that idol group, huh?

437
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,940
I don't... How would I... I don't think...

438
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,040
Hold on, let me check on...

439
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,840
Let me see if they're even on Joy Sound.

440
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,080
Because I like that idol group.

441
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,100
I love that idol group.

442
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,740
Wait, is my switch dead?

443
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,430
I just charged it.

444
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,830
My switch might be dead.

445
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:39,530
Oh, what?

446
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,840
My switch...

447
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,180
Might be dead.

448
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,520
How does that work?

449
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,280
Because I couldn't super yesterday.

450
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,440
But congrats on 3.0.

451
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,880
Thank you, Tok Tok!

452
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,400
Thank you!

453
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,800
Popular?

454
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,660
Yeah!

455
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,520
Well guys, I guess today is English karaoke only.

456
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,140
I'm so sorry.

457
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,660
Oh my gosh.

458
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,200
I can charge it.

459
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,440
I think it's charging now.

460
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
I think so.

461
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,240
I'm popular.

462
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,920
There it is.

463
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
I can sing this song.

464
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,640
Hopefully it's not too loud.

465
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,840
If so, I can adjust.

466
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,340
Don't worry.

467
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:31,500
Let's do it.

468
00:28:34,400 --> 00:29:15,420
Whenever I see someone less fortunate than I And let's face it, who isn't less fortunate than I My tender heart tends to start to bleed And when someone needs a makeover, I simply have to take over I know, I know Exactly What they need And even in your case Though it's the toughest case I've yet to face Don't worry I'm determined to succeed Follow my lead And yes,

469
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:57,960
indeed You will be Popular You're gonna be popular I'll teach you the proper poise When you talk to boys Little ways to flirt and flounce I'll show you what shoes to wear How to fix your hair Everything that really counts to be popular I'll help you be popular You'll hang with the right cohorts You'll be good at sports Know the slang you've got to know So let's start Cause you've got an awfully long way to go Don't be offended by my frank analysis.

470
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,740
Think of it as personality dialysis.

471
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,640
Now that I've chosen to become a pal, a sister, an advisor.

472
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,320
There's nobody wiser, not when it comes to popular.

473
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,520
I know about popular.

474
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,380
And with an assist from me, to be who you'll be.

475
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,180
Instead of dreary, who you were, well are.

476
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,380
There's nothing that can stop you from becoming popular.

477
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,900
Lar, lar.

478
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,100
La, la, la, la.

479
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,340
We're gonna make you popular.

480
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,360
When I see depressing creatures.

481
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,940
I don't know the tune in this part, depressing creatures.

482
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,220
I remind them on their own behalf.

483
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,080
To think of celebrated heads of state.

484
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,380
Or especially great communicators.

485
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,600
Did they have brains or knowledge?

486
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,400
Don't make me laugh.

487
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,880
They were popular.

488
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,020
Please.

489
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,320
It's all about popular.

490
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,840
It's not about aptitude.

491
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,200
It's the way you're viewed.

492
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,560
So it's very shrewd to be.

493
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,780
Very, very popular.

494
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,480
Like me.

495
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,500
Why, chat.

496
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,460
Look at you.

497
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,520
You're beautiful.

498
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,960
I have to go.

499
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,600
You're welcome.

500
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,760
Though you protest.

501
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,540
Your disinterest.

502
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,960
I know clandestinely.

503
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,060
You're gonna grin and bear it.

504
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,600
Your newfound popularity.

505
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,880
Lar, lar, la, la.

506
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,220
You'll be popular.

507
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:57,500
Just not quite as popular as me.

508
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,680
Oh guys, don't you know I'm the most...

509
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,080
That song is all about me.

510
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,620
You know me.

511
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,200
I'm the most popular gal there is.

512
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,920
I'm...

513
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,680
I'm not...

514
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,540
I'm so popular.

515
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,500
Incredible job channeling her.

516
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,300
Thank you, Kristin Chenoweth.

517
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,940
Stop it.

518
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,260
Stop it.

519
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,040
Stop it.

520
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,400
Oh my god, this is so weird.

521
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,720
I love Kristin Chenoweth.

522
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,920
Dead girl walking from Heather's...

523
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,560
What is that?

524
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,920
The one where he goes...

525
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,640
You better come out now, Heather.

526
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,560
I'm counting to three.

527
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,700
One, two...

528
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,140
Fuck it.

529
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,140
Sure, grandma.

530
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,340
I don't know that.

531
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,260
No, that's meant to be yours.

532
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:04,880
Oh shoot.

533
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,920
I don't know what that...

534
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,360
I know kind of like...

535
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,980
I'm a dead girl walking.

536
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:09,860
I think.

537
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,420
I don't know.

538
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,620
Bye, Zack.

539
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,200
Thank you for the 20 gifted.

540
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,260
Thank you.

541
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:18,840
Thank you.

542
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,720
I don't know if I'm ever saying your name right.

543
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,820
I'm so sorry.

544
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,500
Dead girl singing.

545
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,100
Suddenly Seymour, please.

546
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,380
Why is it suddenly turning into all musicals?

547
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,440
Christmas song.

548
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,640
What is a Christmas song?

549
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,780
It's a Christmas song.

550
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,100
Christmas song.

551
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,440
Jingle bells.

552
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,120
All I want for Christmas.

553
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,040
Leila, thanks for the five gifted.

554
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,840
Last Christmas.

555
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,280
Thanks for three votes.

556
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,300
Snow Halation.

557
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,700
Yeah, but I don't have the...

558
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,260
My switch right now is dead.

559
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,000
It's charging, I think.

560
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,220
Let me double check.

561
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,620
I think it's charging.

562
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,560
Wait, it might be on.

563
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,840
Wait, I just remembered.

564
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,580
I think it's on.

565
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,080
Wait.

566
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,320
It's on.

567
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,560
Oh my gosh, you guys, I couldn't see.

568
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,560
I'm stupid because it's plugged in.

569
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,080
I've been trying to power it off this whole time.

570
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,460
You guys, see, hold on.

571
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:49,920
Wait.

572
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,320
See?

573
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,060
It was on this whole time.

574
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,980
So we do have Japanese songs.

575
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,920
I just have to...

576
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,080
Hello?

577
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,600
My Joy-Cons aren't connecting.

578
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,400
Sonic.

579
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,260
Hello?

580
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,360
Joy-Cons?

581
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,160
Well, while I get this set up, let's sing something else too.

582
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,500
Boomerang.

583
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,460
Thank you for the 20 yen.

584
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,360
Thank you.

585
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,300
Snow Halation.

586
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,120
Here, I'll sing...

587
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,520
A Christmas song.

588
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,720
I guess it's the season, huh?

589
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,560
Father Christmas by the Kings.

590
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,720
I don't know if I know that one.

591
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,680
Christmas, Christmas.

592
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,340
Christmas, Christmas.

593
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,040
Oh, this one's the Carpenters.

594
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,880
Christmas song.

595
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,280
What is this one?

596
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,960
I'm like, I'm just going to pick a song I don't even know.

597
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,640
Why isn't it working?

598
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,400
My Joy-Cons.

599
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:00,840
Wait.

600
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,360
Christmas song.

601
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:04,700
Oh!

602
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,020
Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire.

603
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,670
All through the year we...

604
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,390
I don't know this song.

605
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:23,270
I give up.

606
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,710
It says Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire.

607
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,330
That's completely a lie.

608
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:35,290
Wait.

609
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,950
Christmas song, start now.

610
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:46,930
Cursed Mariah.

611
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,910
That was the intro.

612
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,430
I'll let her sing it then.

613
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:07,910
Bring in the wintertime, bring in the happiest season of all.

614
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:14,930
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire.

615
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:21,150
Jack Frost nipping at your nose.

616
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:27,830
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir.

617
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:33,350
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

618
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:47,310
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe help to make the season bright.

619
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,390
Tiny tots.

620
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,530
Tater tots.

621
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,750
A little pause.

622
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,730
Hard to sleep tonight.

623
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:08,110
They know that Santa's on his way.

624
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,690
He's loaded lots of tater tots.

625
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:12,330
Sorry.

626
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,800
I said toys but I thought I said tots again.

627
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:28,180
The reindeer really know how to fly.

628
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:41,500
And so I'm offering this simple praise to kids from 1 to 92.

629
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,520
Am I hungry or something?

630
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,060
Although it's been said many times.

631
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,480
There's many ways.

632
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:55,040
Merry Christmas to you.

633
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:03,080
They know that Santa's on his way.

634
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,440
He's on his way.

635
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:08,020
He's loaded lots of tater tots.

636
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,240
For his sleigh.

637
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,160
And every mother's child.

638
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,660
Why did I go up in an octave?

639
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:24,340
To see if a reindeer really know how to fly.

640
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,900
And so...

641
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,360
I'm sorry I can't get over it.

642
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,490
I'm sorry.

643
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:46,170
Although it's been said many times.

644
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,850
There's many ways.

645
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:56,390
Merry Christmas to you.

646
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,360
I'm not putting this on the set list.

647
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,800
In fact, I'm not doing another Christmas song.

648
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,570
No more Christmas songs.

649
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,550
Oh my gosh, I can't stop thinking about tater tots.

650
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,830
I was actually tearing up.

651
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,030
Oh my goodness, Goofy.

652
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:28,570
OK,

653
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:35,380
let me try to get my Switch to...Oh, it turned off.

654
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,180
I'm a Goofy Goober.

655
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,540
I'm a Goofy Goober.

656
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,980
Oh, start.

657
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,060
Why are my Joy-Cons not working?

658
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,480
Start, please.

659
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,820
Your re-debut yesterday...

660
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,040
Filled my dark soul with light.

661
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,080
Maybe...

662
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,820
Oh, that's why.

663
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,120
I'm an idiot, guys.

664
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,740
I'm really sorry.

665
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,740
Once again, I...

666
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,500
Update the system.

667
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,360
Oh, update software.

668
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,060
Oh wait, no, system update.

669
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,140
OK, guys, let's sing another English song.

670
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,740
Because I have to update my...

671
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,360
I have to update my Switch.

672
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,940
You'll be back from Hamilton.

673
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,600
I'm sorry, I don't know any Hamilton songs.

674
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,120
I haven't watched it.

675
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,480
I only know Alexander Hamilton.

676
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,860
I've listened to the demos of Hamilton more than I've listened to the actual songs.

677
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,520
I'm so sorry.

678
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,660
Alexander Hamilton, Alexander Hamilton.

679
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,120
That's all I know.

680
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,000
Fly me to the moon.

681
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,960
Someone asked for that earlier, so...

682
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,460
I can do that one.

683
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,640
But which one is it always?

684
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,360
I never know.

685
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,940
There's like 50... Oh my gosh.

686
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,860
There's actually so many versions of this song.

687
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,400
Oh, OK, never mind.

688
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,160
I put in fly me to the moon and it gave me 27,000 results actually.

689
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,920
Invisible Moose, thanks for the 10 gifted.

690
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,900
Dancing Queen by Ava.

691
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,620
I can do that one too.

692
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,700
I'll do it after.

693
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,360
Maybe this one is...

694
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:43,800
Good.

695
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,860
It's the uptempo one, but is it too uptempo?

696
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,820
I don't know.

697
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:06,470
Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars.

698
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:14,630
Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars.

699
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:21,410
In other words, hold my hand.

700
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:22,310
It's right here.

701
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:29,190
In other words, darling, kiss me.

702
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:38,490
Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore.

703
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:46,450
You are all I long for, all I worship and adore.

704
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:53,250
In other words, please be true.

705
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,490
In other words...

706
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,270
I wonder if you can do a mix here.

707
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:19,670
It's kind of slow though.

708
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:43,660
Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore.

709
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:52,780
You are all I long for, all I worship and adore.

710
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:58,540
In other words, please be true.

711
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,660
In other words...

712
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,010
You can quit though.

713
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:23,970
She hates us.

714
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:24,550
Nonsense.

715
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:26,830
She hates us.

716
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:30,730
Whatever, whatever, whatever.

717
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,370
Whatever, whatever, whatever.

718
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,010
Skip the gap version.

719
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:00,850
You can dance.

720
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:02,730
You can jump.

721
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,160
We'll see that girl.

722
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,180
Watch that scene.

723
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,560
Dig in the dancing queen.

724
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,420
I love this song.

725
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,240
Friday night and the lights are low.

726
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:30,640
Looking out for a place to go.

727
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,960
Where they play the right music.

728
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,900
Getting in the swing.

729
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,620
You gotta look for a king.

730
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,780
Anybody could be that guy.

731
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:49,720
The night is young and the music's high.

732
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,080
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine.

733
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,580
You're in the mood for a dance.

734
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:04,020
And when you get the chance.

735
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,040
You are the dancing queen.

736
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:11,240
Young and sweet, forever nineteen.

737
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,720
Dancing queen.

738
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,780
Feel the beat from the tambourine.

739
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,620
Oh yeah.

740
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,680
You can dance.

741
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,160
You can jive.

742
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,740
Having the time of your life.

743
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,080
We'll see that girl.

744
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,960
Watch that scene.

745
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,240
Dig in the dancing queen.

746
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,070
You're a teaser.

747
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,310
You turn him on.

748
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:15,410
And you get the chance.

749
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:18,370
You are the dancing queen.

750
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:22,150
Young and sweet, forever nineteen.

751
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:27,910
Dancing queen.

752
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:33,070
Feel the beat from the tambourine.

753
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:33,930
Oh yeah.

754
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,970
You can dance.

755
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:40,530
You can jive.

756
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:47,410
We'll see that girl.

757
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,230
Watch that scene.

758
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,610
Dig in the dancing queen.

759
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,280
Dig in the dancing queen.

760
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,540
Dancing queen.

761
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:34,500
Oh my gosh.

762
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,520
I've been seeing so many of those...

763
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,000
Like those 3D ABBA concerts.

764
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,440
I wanna go so bad.

765
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:45,940
Goodbye to Love by the Carpenters.

766
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,340
I don't know if I know it.

767
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:56,340
How many times have you been stuck in a Ghostbusters trap with slime?

768
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,260
Never.

769
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:58,380
Ghostbusters?

770
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,320
Wish they could catch me.

771
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,040
V3 Minto, you're my favorite.

772
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,780
V1 looked like she was about to cry.

773
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,160
What do you mean by that?

774
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,840
V2 hated us.

775
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,740
Yeah, only V2.

776
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,300
Consider I will survive or diamonds are forever.

777
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,420
Diamonds are forever.

778
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:35,500
Thank you.

779
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,280
I don't know that one.

780
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,100
I don't think.

781
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,280
Diamonds are forever.

782
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,180
Do I know that one?

783
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,900
What was the other one?

784
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:48,780
Oh, I will survive.

785
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:49,740
I will survive.

786
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,360
I will survive.

787
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,100
That one?

788
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:52,920
Oh gosh.

789
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:53,820
I could try it.

790
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,040
I don't know if I've ever...

791
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:02,140
For Japanese songs, I have to use like a timed...

792
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,080
Oh, I have enough yen, right?

793
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,280
Oh gosh, I didn't really think about it.

794
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,760
I'm so unprepared for today.

795
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,660
I'm really sorry.

796
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,960
I will survive.

797
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,380
Let's see.

798
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,980
Everyone at my Halloween party is cheering you...

799
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:23,960
What do you mean by that?

800
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,240
What do you mean?

801
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,240
Like a lot of people are watching?

802
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:40,950
Joy, thank you.

803
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:42,450
But no, it's a matter of like...

804
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:45,930
I would have to buy a new yen card.

805
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:47,750
A new like, you know...

806
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:49,810
Oh my gosh, eShop card.

807
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:55,270
So maybe today will just be English.

808
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:55,790
We'll see.

809
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:56,330
We'll see.

810
00:51:59,050 --> 00:51:59,710
We'll see.

811
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:00,170
We'll see.

812
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:10,090
I don't know if I can sing this song well.

813
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:44,130
I just walked in to find you here With that sad look upon your face Should have changed that stupid lock I should have made you leave your key If I had known for just one second You'd be back to bother me So go on, go!

814
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:55,150
Walk out the door Just turn around now Cause you're not welcome anymore Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?

815
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:56,550
Did you think I'd crumble?

816
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:59,430
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

817
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:00,710
Oh no, not I!

818
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:05,850
I will survive Oh, as long as I don't...

819
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:10,310
Oh no, I have the performance anxiety!

820
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:15,550
I'll survive I will survive

821
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:37,220
Took all the strength I had Not to fall apart Wait, how does this part go?

822
00:53:37,940 --> 00:54:06,140
This is all my broken heart And I spent oh so many nights Just feeling sorry for myself I used to cry But now I hold my head up high And you see me Somebody new I'm not that chained up little person Still in love with you And so you felt like dropping in And just expect me to be free Well now I'm saving all my loving For someone who's loving me Go on now,

823
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:06,760
Kyle.

824
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,800
Walk out the door.

825
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:13,460
Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.

826
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,680
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?

827
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,000
Did you think I'd crumble?

828
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,960
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

829
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,220
Oh no, not I.

830
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,240
I will survive.

831
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:30,280
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive.

832
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:34,340
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give.

833
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,620
And I'll survive.

834
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,300
I will survive.

835
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,120
Oh...

836
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,980
Go on now, Kyle.

837
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,860
Walk out the door.

838
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:50,840
Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome here anymore.

839
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,900
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?

840
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,060
Did you think I'd crumble?

841
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,040
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

842
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,300
Oh no, not I.

843
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,480
I will survive.

844
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:07,540
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive.

845
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:11,500
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give.

846
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,420
And I'll survive.

847
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,520
I will survive.

848
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,000
I will survive.

849
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:24,080
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive.

850
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,040
Got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give.

851
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,000
And I'll survive.

852
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,080
I will survive.

853
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,520
It's really awkward as a ghost singing that song.

854
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,800
I don't have all my life to live.

855
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,500
Um, but you know, it's just a song.

856
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,060
It's just a song.

857
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,440
It's just a song.

858
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,680
I will survive.

859
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,580
I want to try and sing.

860
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:58,900
Can I get a, okay, hold on.

861
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,960
I know I'm like mid karaoke, but can I practice real quick?

862
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:05,840
Hold on.

863
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,600
I, cause I want to have a revengeance of the song I sang with Urb yesterday.

864
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,300
Thank you, Minty, for the 10 gifted.

865
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:13,180
Thank you so much.

866
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,060
I love your voice.

867
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:14,860
Thank you.

868
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:15,700
Thank you.

869
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:16,320
Thank you.

870
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,900
Um, what was it called?

871
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:22,340
Revengeance?

872
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,920
Yeah, my revengeance.

873
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,620
Um, oh, die with a smile.

874
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,220
Maybe I should do Bruno Mars' part.

875
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:40,500
No, I really just wanted like, I wanted like, Elizabeth to just sing so much of the song.

876
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:43,020
So I gave her, I was like Bruno Mars to you.

877
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:47,580
Hold on though.

878
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,620
This is a practice real quick.

879
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,740
I have to hear the harmonies.

880
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,920
I think I remember it, but it's also, I get kind of my brain.

881
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:26,620
Okay.

882
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:31,780
We're just going to have to listen to not Bruno Mars for a minute though.

883
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,760
Cause he sings the beginning.

884
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,520
So, okay.

885
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,600
This is the die with a smile.

886
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:42,860
I wish it was Elizabeth, but I forgot to ask her if I could use her, her version again.

887
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,880
So I'm so sorry.

888
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,320
You're stuck with not Bruno Mars.

889
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:51,820
Instead of Liz's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, amazing voice.

890
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,700
Can you believe her?

891
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,660
She's so amazing.

892
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,120
She said it was an honor to sing with me.

893
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,640
I was like, girl, no.

894
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,080
What are you talking about?

895
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:30,420
So I'm gonna love you every night, like it's the last night, like it's the last night.

896
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:37,660
If the world was empty, I want to be next to you.

897
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:53,340
If the party was over, and our time on earth was through, I'd wanna hold you just for a while.

898
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:57,780
And die with a smile.

899
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:05,540
If the world was empty, I'd wanna be next to you.

900
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,340
Oh, oh.

901
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,320
Oh, we're lost.

902
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,840
Lost in the words that we scream.

903
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,380
I don't even wanna do this anymore.

904
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,840
Cause you already know what you mean to me.

905
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:31,580
And our love's the only war worth fighting for.

906
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,880
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow.

907
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,760
Nobody's promised tomorrow.

908
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:47,940
So I'ma love you every night, like it's the last night, like it's the last night.

909
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:55,140
If the world was empty, I'd wanna be next to you.

910
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:10,600
If the party was over, and our time on earth was through, I'd wanna hold you just for a while.

911
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:15,120
And die with a smile.

912
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:22,600
If the world was empty, I'd wanna be next to you.

913
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,020
Right next to you.

914
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:27,800
Get away from me, not Bruno Mars.

915
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:31,340
Next to you.

916
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,820
Right next to you.

917
01:00:55,850 --> 01:01:03,450
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you.

918
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:19,350
If the party was over, and our time on earth was through, I'd wanna hold you just for a while.

919
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:23,670
And die with a smile.

920
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:30,270
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you.

921
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:39,910
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you.

922
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,600
I'd wanna be next to you.

923
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:49,880
Hey,

924
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,500
I kinda remembered it.

925
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,640
I was so struck yesterday though, gosh, what a queen.

926
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:02,820
Maybe one day I can use her version again.

927
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:08,800
But it'll be awkward because she'll be like, congrats on your 3.0, and I'll be like, that was like 5 months ago, but thanks.

928
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,860
Sad not with herb though.

929
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:16,140
With fake Bruno Mars.

930
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:24,180
Someone asked about something earlier and I can't remember what it was.

931
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:27,620
Hot dog.

932
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,760
You're not just a dancing queen, you're a singing queen.

933
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:36,740
Oh goodness gracious, great balls of fire.

934
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:41,960
No, no.

935
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:50,380
I have a... Hot to go?

936
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:56,470
Wait, I sang it yesterday, is it okay?

937
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:01,390
I don't think I'm really good at singing that song though.

938
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:01,510
I don't know.

939
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:05,530
I don't think I'm really good at singing it though.

940
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:10,050
It was Narissa's choice.

941
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:16,770
I was really happy though that I was able to...

942
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:30,790
Because I chose Narissa and Liz, and they do mostly English songs, so I was just like, oh, if I sing... At first I was like, should we do Japanese songs, but they said it would be okay since on my channel I can keep it up.

943
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:38,430
The first time I heard that song was yesterday, thank you and herb did it best.

944
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:40,650
Love me, love me, love me.

945
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:43,530
What's that one?

946
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:49,500
Okay, hot to go.

947
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,820
Hot to go but just me.

948
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:53,500
Sad, lonely.

949
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,540
Oh my goodness.

950
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:02,140
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.

951
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:04,520
Oh, the aishite.

952
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,080
I could

953
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:18,740
be the one or your new addiction.

954
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:22,120
It's all in my head, but I want nonfiction.

955
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,680
I don't want the world, but I'll take this city.

956
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,300
Who can blame a girl?

957
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:29,080
Call me hot, not pretty.

958
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,900
Baby, do you like this beat?

959
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,400
I made it so you dance with me.

960
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,520
It's like 199 degrees.

961
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:43,020
When you're doing it with me, doing it with me.

962
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,780
H-O-T-T-O-G-O.

963
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,560
Snap and clap and touch your toes.

964
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,200
Raise your hands now, body roll.

965
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:49,920
Dance it out, you're hot to go.

966
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,640
H-O-T-T-O-G-O.

967
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,420
Snap and clap and touch your toes.

968
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,020
Raise your hands now, body roll.

969
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,760
H-O-T-T-O-G-O.

970
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,040
H-O-T-T-O-G-O.

971
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,500
You can take me hot to go.

972
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:06,920
H-O-T-T-O-G-O.

973
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:10,240
You can take me hot to go.

974
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,660
Well, I woke up alone staring at my ceiling.

975
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:17,160
I try not to care, but it hurts my feelings.

976
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,820
You don't have to stare.

977
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,600
Come here, get with it.

978
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,460
No one's touched me there in a damn minute.

979
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,760
And baby, don't you like this beat?

980
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,280
I made it so you'd sleep with me.

981
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:33,440
It's like 199 degrees.

982
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:37,860
When you're doing it with me, doing it with me.

983
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,620
H-O-T-T-O-G-O.

984
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,400
Snap and clap and touch your toes.

985
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:43,060
Raise your hands now, body roll.

986
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,760
Dance it out, you're hot to go.

987
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,480
H-O-T-T-O-G-O.

988
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,280
Snap and clap and touch your toes.

989
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,900
Raise your hands now, body roll.

990
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:51,640
H-O-T-T-O-G-O.

991
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:54,920
H-O-T-T-O-G-O.

992
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,160
You can take me hot to go.

993
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,700
H-O-T-T-O-G-O.

994
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,300
You can take me hot to go.

995
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:07,160
What's it take to get your number?

996
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:09,020
What's it take to bring you home?

997
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,600
Hurry up, it's time for supper.

998
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,440
Order up, I'm hot to go.

999
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:14,040
What's it take to get your number?

1000
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,860
Hurry up, it's getting cold.

1001
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,420
Hurry up, it's time for supper.

1002
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,720
Order up, I'm hot to go.

1003
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:36,170
H-O-T-T-O-G-O.

1004
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:39,450
You can take me hot to go.

1005
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:42,910
H-O-T-T-O-G-O.

1006
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:46,490
You can take me hot to go.

1007
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:49,930
It's hot in here.

1008
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:52,030
Is anyone else hot?

1009
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,290
You're coming home with me, right?

1010
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:57,570
Okay, it's hot.

1011
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:10,370
Hold on, I need a sippy.

1012
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:19,420
Oh my gosh, do you guys want to see how I look when I eat?

1013
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:21,720
Here, I'll grab a chip.

1014
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,120
I'll grab a chip.

1015
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,560
Where's a chip?

1016
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,320
My stash of chips.

1017
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,080
These ones are in the shapes of ghosts.

1018
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:39,680
Looks just like a guy going like...

1019
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,040
Okay.

1020
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:50,720
They're veggie chips, so they're good for me probably.

1021
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:00,030
Yummy.

1022
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:03,810
Okay, I'm done.

1023
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:11,980
Okay.

1024
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,700
Sorry if you hate ASMR chewing.

1025
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,380
Maybe I should've done a warning.

1026
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:21,240
Maybe I should've done a warning.

1027
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:24,880
I get the Moe aesthetic now.

1028
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,920
Moe is justice.

1029
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:31,880
I feel we are losing Moe way.

1030
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,800
But Moe is everything.

1031
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:38,000
Moe should be in all of our lives and afterlives, I believe.

1032
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,860
I'm a Moe connoisseur.

1033
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:48,100
Moe cute is life and afterlife.

1034
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,080
Basically.

1035
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:54,880
Hi.

1036
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:55,800
Hi!

1037
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,180
Thanks for the superchat!

1038
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,520
Someone actually brought up the carpenters earlier.

1039
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,940
It makes me want to sing a carpenter song.

1040
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:03,480
I hope it's okay.

1041
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:09,420
It's a song I think about.

1042
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,440
Every time I think about Snake, I think about this song.

1043
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,060
Wait, where is it?

1044
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:21,760
Wait, where is it?

1045
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:24,820
Wait, where is it?

1046
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,440
Wait, one second.

1047
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,660
Your new model is so cute.

1048
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:36,660
Thank you!

1049
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,240
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1050
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,340
One second.

1051
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:48,010
What can I find here?

1052
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:55,780
Did I put it in wrong?

1053
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:04,540
No?

1054
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:06,180
It was here.

1055
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:09,140
Let me put it like this.

1056
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,080
Oh, there it is.

1057
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:15,340
Okay.

1058
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:23,220
I always think of Snake with this song.

1059
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:47,370
You are near, just like me.

1060
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:53,070
They long to be close to you.

1061
01:10:54,670 --> 01:11:06,730
Why do stars fall down from the sky every time you walk by?

1062
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:09,470
You are near, just like me.

1063
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:15,830
They long to be close to you.

1064
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:27,630
On the day that you were born, the angels got together and decided to create a dream come true.

1065
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:35,830
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair and golden starlight in your eyes of blue.

1066
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:49,150
That is why all the girls in town follow you all around.

1067
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:52,790
You are near, just like me.

1068
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:58,130
They long to be close to you.

1069
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:00,110
I am looking at him right now.

1070
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:03,250
Oh, my little Snake.

1071
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:06,550
I love you so much.

1072
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:11,590
You are the cutest little guy ever.

1073
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:15,830
I love you.

1074
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:19,670
I love you so much.

1075
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:32,730
On the day that you were born, the angels got together and decided to create a dream come true.

1076
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:40,810
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair and golden starlight in your eyes of blue.

1077
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:53,910
That is why all the girls in town follow you all around.

1078
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:57,710
You are near, just like me.

1079
01:12:58,490 --> 01:13:03,290
They long to be close to you.

1080
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:08,670
You are near, just like me.

1081
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:15,570
They long to be close to you.

1082
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:16,610
I

1083
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:23,870
bought like three more recently.

1084
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:25,850
Love,

1085
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:32,590
close to you.

1086
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:36,250
Love,

1087
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:43,010
close to you.

1088
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:53,010
Ah, close to you.

1089
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:57,050
Ah,

1090
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:04,310
close to you.

1091
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:05,750
Should I get closer?

1092
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:05,790
Should I get closer?

1093
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:11,690
Yeah,

1094
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:19,250
I have... How many do I have now of these little Snake Power Pro guys?

1095
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:22,470
Maybe like seven?

1096
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:25,770
Seven, I think.

1097
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:29,090
I can't stop ordering them.

1098
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:31,450
I'm gonna have an army forever.

1099
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,050
Am I too close?

1100
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:43,890
I'm gonna lick you if I get any closer.

1101
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:53,530
Don't worry, I'm not gonna lick you.

1102
01:14:53,970 --> 01:14:57,550
In my head I'm imagining a music video and it was from mostly the point of view of Ocelot.

1103
01:14:57,890 --> 01:14:58,950
Yes, exactly!

1104
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:01,610
Exactly, you get it, you get it, you get it.

1105
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:03,390
I think I might be Ocelot.

1106
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:07,890
Maybe.

1107
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:09,150
Oh gosh.

1108
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:13,110
I think I would destroy the world for Snake.

1109
01:15:17,330 --> 01:15:18,490
I'm blushing out, Minto.

1110
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:37,580
There was something else that I thought of singing.

1111
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,580
I can't remember what it was, I should have written it down.

1112
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:42,560
Are you okay?

1113
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:43,500
Are you okay, Ducky?

1114
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,420
Mint would totally misinterpret Snake's will.

1115
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:51,000
No.

1116
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:56,960
No!

1117
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:00,100
No.

1118
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,160
I don't know what that guy wants.

1119
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,980
I don't know what that guy wants.

1120
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:09,460
Gosh, what was I gonna sing?

1121
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:11,540
Very cute!

1122
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,180
Oh my gosh, you guys, look when I...

1123
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:17,000
Hold on.

1124
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:19,420
Watch my lips.

1125
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,140
Sometimes it does it, sometimes it doesn't.

1126
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,620
But let's see if it does it today.

1127
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:26,840
Oh, you can kind of see.

1128
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,100
It kind of works.

1129
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:47,760
Oh, that was close to you.

1130
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:49,860
One second.

1131
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:52,080
Close.

1132
01:16:55,780 --> 01:17:00,280
Oh my gosh, the song that I was wanting to sing is on the tip of my tongue, but I can't remember.

1133
01:17:07,010 --> 01:17:07,490
I can't remember.

1134
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:08,810
Oh, it's gonna annoy me.

1135
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:12,910
Can't remember.

1136
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:16,470
There was something that I was like...

1137
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:19,030
I was like, oh, okay, I'm gonna sing this.

1138
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:26,170
But I think I will sing this song that I saw in the chat.

1139
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,230
But I have to get a karaoke for it.

1140
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:32,550
And I have to get dressed.

1141
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:41,000
I have to get dressed.

1142
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:42,880
Do you guys like my eyepatch?

1143
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:46,680
Did you guys see the picture that Ayami Mama posted on Twitter?

1144
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:50,860
So actually, that's how the eyepatch came to be.

1145
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:52,620
Because she drew...

1146
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,240
Actually, she drew...

1147
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,240
She drew a lot of really funny faces.

1148
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:02,160
Before we came up with the cat eye one...

1149
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:07,500
I had drawn something similar to the cat eye, but it looked off.

1150
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,140
It looked weird.

1151
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:13,100
So we were like, let's brainstorm some stuff.

1152
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:18,220
And she drew me as a Pepe.

1153
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,520
And she drew me as a South Park character.

1154
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,240
And she drew me as a...

1155
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:25,180
What were the other ones?

1156
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:29,480
But then she also drew that...

1157
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:32,420
Snake version, and I was like...

1158
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:32,700
Show?

1159
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:33,360
I'll show!

1160
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:35,240
I'll ask her if I can...

1161
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,500
I'll ask her if I can show...

1162
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,720
Hold on, let me see if...

1163
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:40,140
Where is she?

1164
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:42,380
I don't think she's awake yet.

1165
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:46,980
Gosh, I'm sleepy.

1166
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:47,740
Oh my goodness.

1167
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:51,780
It was a long time ago though, so I have to go way back.

1168
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:52,500
Oh gosh.

1169
01:18:58,660 --> 01:18:59,840
Oh, there's me naked.

1170
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:04,100
Oh, I found it!

1171
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,260
Oh, the other one was just like...

1172
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:08,000
Funky, like...

1173
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:08,840
Round eyes.

1174
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:10,740
Wow!

1175
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:13,340
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

1176
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:14,760
Thank you so much!

1177
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:15,800
Thank you!

1178
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:19,020
Punished Venominto.

1179
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,280
Hold on.

1180
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:24,220
But yeah, then she also drew...

1181
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:26,340
The snake, and I was like...

1182
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:27,300
It actually...

1183
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,000
She had like the big mint on it, and I kind of...

1184
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,860
I didn't tell her to keep it...

1185
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:33,420
But I kind of wish she had kept it.

1186
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,380
Let me see.

1187
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:36,860
Okay.

1188
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:47,540
Alright, okay.

1189
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,460
I'm gonna sing another song.

1190
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:50,140
Oh, this one.

1191
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:51,860
Yeah.

1192
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,600
I love my eyepatch.

1193
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:59,980
There was a reason I wasn't going to go with an eyepatch for this.

1194
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:02,440
But...

1195
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:04,460
Um...

1196
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:06,960
Because I actually had another outfit planned with an eyepatch.

1197
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:11,300
But I...

1198
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:13,520
Then saw it, and I was like, you know what?

1199
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:14,640
Whatever.

1200
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,420
Everything can have an eyepatch.

1201
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,840
Oh my gosh, I need to message her even and be like...

1202
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,180
Hey, when are we starting the next outfit?

1203
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,160
Michael, thanks for the gifted!

1204
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,580
I need my phantom cigar.

1205
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:35,940
Okey-dokey.

1206
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:39,710
Is this?

1207
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:40,170
Hold on.

1208
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:41,750
Let me check this one real quick.

1209
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:44,170
Oh wait, I'm stupid.

1210
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:45,210
I have my own karaoke.

1211
01:20:46,190 --> 01:20:47,730
I got it from the actual...

1212
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:49,430
I was looking it up on YouTube.

1213
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:53,910
I have my own that I got from the official soundtrack.

1214
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:58,190
I think I own all Metal Gear CDs now, you guys.

1215
01:20:59,190 --> 01:20:59,550
Yippee!

1216
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:03,830
If there's a song I want, I have it.

1217
01:21:06,190 --> 01:21:07,250
Oh, this might be it.

1218
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:07,550
Wait.

1219
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:10,510
Let me turn it up, because it actually might be quiet.

1220
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:22,620
Oh wait, I need lyrics.

1221
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:48,240
But now, love can kill, love will die, give me wings to fly.

1222
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:56,500
Feeling this world so cold, I just wonder why.

1223
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:06,380
Cold as the dark, now my words are frosted with every breath.

1224
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:14,600
Still the hate burns wild, growing inside this heart.

1225
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:21,300
When the wind changes course, when the stars align.

1226
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:29,440
I will reach out to you and leave this all behind.

1227
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:32,400
When heaven's divine.

1228
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,160
Now I have an iPod 4.

1229
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:48,840
I actually really wanted an iPod 4.

1230
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:54,060
Metal Gear Solid 3, I almost delayed playing it so I could have it.

1231
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,220
Now I have it for the rest of the games though.

1232
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:07,380
When heaven's divine, I will see the choices within my hands.

1233
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:15,000
How can we ever protect and fight with our tiny souls?

1234
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:21,380
Let me shine like the sun through the doubts and fear.

1235
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:29,700
Do you feel the storm approach as the end draws near?

1236
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:37,300
When heaven's divine, time will come to softly lay me down.

1237
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:44,740
Then I can see a face that I long to see.

1238
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:51,480
And for you, only you, I would give anything.

1239
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:59,740
Leaving a trace for love to find a way.

1240
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:02,540
When heaven's divine.

1241
01:24:18,450 --> 01:24:26,090
I will dive into the fire, spilling the blood of my desire.

1242
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:36,050
The very last time, my name scorched into the sky.

1243
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:44,090
When heaven's divine, I will see the choices within my hands.

1244
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:52,430
How can we ever protect and fight with our tiny souls?

1245
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:59,710
Let me shine like the sun through the doubts and fear.

1246
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:07,170
Do you feel the storm approach as the end draws near?

1247
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:14,770
When heaven's divine, time will come to softly lay me down.

1248
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:22,270
Then I can see a face that I long to see.

1249
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:29,110
And for you, only you, I would give anything.

1250
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:37,050
Leaving a trace for love to find a way.

1251
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:39,150
When heaven's divine.

1252
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:08,550
Leaving a trace for love to find a way.

1253
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:14,330
When heaven's divine.

1254
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:24,700
Yay!

1255
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,200
I'm so glad I can sing that song.

1256
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:35,480
Without any permission stuff.

1257
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:37,680
Yay!

1258
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,620
That was Heaven's Divide from Metal Gear Solid.

1259
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:41,500
Peace Obaka!

1260
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,320
One of my favorite Metal Gear games.

1261
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,320
So underrated.

1262
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:49,180
So, so, so, so underrated.

1263
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,120
Vic Boss!

1264
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:51,540
Yeah!

1265
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:53,060
Vic Boss!

1266
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:53,700
Vic Boss!

1267
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,180
Actually there's another song I wanna sing.

1268
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:57,100
I hope it's okay.

1269
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:58,640
This one I've never sung before.

1270
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:01,640
But I've been listening to it a lot more recently.

1271
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:03,180
Oh, let me...

1272
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:09,180
I've been listening to it a lot more recently and...

1273
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:13,180
It's kind of maybe sad, but...

1274
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:14,920
ZZ!

1275
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:16,220
Thank you for the birthday gift!

1276
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:17,420
Thank you!

1277
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:20,440
Tempest!

1278
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,400
Thank you for the 10 gift!

1279
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,660
Thank you so much!

1280
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:26,600
Hold on.

1281
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:28,640
Oh, here.

1282
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:35,200
I'm gonna sing a piano version of this song.

1283
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:42,390
I think...

1284
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:43,270
Hold on.

1285
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:45,910
Pretty sure it's this one.

1286
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:46,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1287
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:46,790
Okay.

1288
01:27:48,990 --> 01:27:49,750
This one...

1289
01:27:50,410 --> 01:27:52,190
Like I said, I've been listening to it a lot more...

1290
01:27:52,190 --> 01:27:52,630
Minty!

1291
01:27:52,730 --> 01:27:54,050
Thank you for another 10!

1292
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:55,110
Thank you, thank you!

1293
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:56,850
Really appreciate it!

1294
01:27:57,210 --> 01:27:59,730
Thank you, thank you, thank you so much, you guys!

1295
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:04,690
Then maybe after this we can go to some JP songs.

1296
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:07,430
How's that sound?

1297
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:10,170
Hope it's way too far.

1298
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:12,330
I can do that one after.

1299
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:16,550
But this one's not Metal Gear.

1300
01:28:19,190 --> 01:28:20,450
Is the switch ready?

1301
01:28:20,530 --> 01:28:21,410
Yeah, it's all good.

1302
01:28:23,450 --> 01:28:24,330
Wichita Lineman?

1303
01:28:24,650 --> 01:28:25,350
Okay, stop.

1304
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:27,350
You guys are picking all my favorites.

1305
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:30,710
How do you guys know that song?

1306
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:33,410
I heard that once on NPR, I think it was.

1307
01:28:34,450 --> 01:28:34,890
Wow!

1308
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:37,250
Thank you for the birthday gift!

1309
01:28:37,630 --> 01:28:38,330
Thank you!

1310
01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:40,890
Lonely Star?

1311
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:43,310
Lonely Rolling Star.

1312
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:44,250
Wait, okay, way too far.

1313
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:45,150
Hold on, I'm making a list.

1314
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:49,370
Okay, I can sing these.

1315
01:28:52,090 --> 01:28:53,830
You get better every time you sing, boss?

1316
01:28:55,790 --> 01:29:00,230
I really wanted to do singing lessons.

1317
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:06,150
Because I want to get better at making my voice sound more powerful for some songs.

1318
01:29:06,150 --> 01:29:07,650
I think.

1319
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:11,210
Okay.

1320
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:13,890
Alright, this song.

1321
01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:15,530
I have the lyrics.

1322
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:17,290
Okay.

1323
01:29:43,400 --> 01:30:02,900
This point reminds me of eons gone by An astro girl watching galaxies rise and fall Wondering the meaning of it all Till like a comet you came into my orbit I know I'm not alone

1324
01:30:07,450 --> 01:30:09,250
I'm not alone

1325
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:31,180
So, now you are here.

1326
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:34,320
The constellations are so clear.

1327
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:39,820
Your gravity is pulling me, until our hearts collide.

1328
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,020
My satellite, their darkness is my light.

1329
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:47,100
The darkest night's got the cosmos at our feet, but you are all I need.

1330
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:50,360
Though we've just begun, I know we'll make it.

1331
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:55,180
Cause somehow, the universe is fun now.

1332
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:10,850
Sunrise and night can be so intertwined.

1333
01:31:11,490 --> 01:31:17,150
The event horizon line between darkness and light.

1334
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:22,950
An astro girl watching her story come and go.

1335
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:25,930
Pondering the punchline of the joke.

1336
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:30,290
Till like a comet, you came into my orbit, I know.

1337
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:10,440
When our hearts grow bigger than the sun, there's no challenge we can't overcome.

1338
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:14,460
So send them over and watch our supernova explode.

1339
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:23,200
I'm not alone, now you are here.

1340
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:26,320
The constellations are so clear.

1341
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:32,600
Infinity sounds good to me, as long as you are by my side.

1342
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:39,900
The Milky Way's not far away when our love travels faster than the speed of light.

1343
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:42,420
Let's go, I know, we'll make it.

1344
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:47,400
Cause somehow, the universe is fun.

1345
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:19,770
That was

1346
01:33:25,170 --> 01:33:26,450
Astro Girl.

1347
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:30,250
Love that song.

1348
01:33:32,030 --> 01:33:32,710
Oh, grill.

1349
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:36,330
Astro Girl.

1350
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:40,770
Such a cute song.

1351
01:33:40,910 --> 01:33:44,070
This version is so beautiful and then the original is so cute.

1352
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:48,310
Astro Grill.

1353
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:51,450
Means a lot to hear Astro Girl.

1354
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:53,670
I hope I did it okay.

1355
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:55,070
I hope I did it justice.

1356
01:33:56,190 --> 01:33:56,590
Let's see.

1357
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:02,690
Let's see, way too foul.

1358
01:34:02,690 --> 01:34:04,790
Oh no, it's not on carophone.

1359
01:34:06,710 --> 01:34:10,090
Hold on, am I gonna get really copyright struck, I wonder.

1360
01:34:11,410 --> 01:34:12,030
I wonder.

1361
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:14,490
Also, there was a raid.

1362
01:34:14,830 --> 01:34:16,190
I didn't catch who it was, I was singing.

1363
01:34:16,410 --> 01:34:17,830
Thank you for the raid.

1364
01:34:18,510 --> 01:34:19,470
Thank you.

1365
01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:23,010
Thank you for singing Astro Girl.

1366
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:24,530
Of course, thank you.

1367
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:27,330
For letting me sing it.

1368
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:30,890
Way too foul.

1369
01:34:32,730 --> 01:34:33,110
Karaoke.

1370
01:34:39,010 --> 01:34:41,110
Let me see if any of these work.

1371
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:52,450
I guess this works.

1372
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:54,710
It's a little crunchy sounding, but it should be okay.

1373
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:58,030
Lucky ducky, I do my best.

1374
01:34:58,110 --> 01:34:58,910
I've never sung this before.

1375
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:04,190
Hopefully it's okay.

1376
01:35:05,070 --> 01:35:08,530
Oh wait, I have to have my patch on again.

1377
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:59,780
They'll tell you what they know But they won't show

1378
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:13,800
I've got something in my throat I need to be alone

1379
01:36:42,190 --> 01:36:45,210
Oh son, oh I'm sorry, the lyrics are kind of off.

1380
01:36:45,210 --> 01:36:49,750
You'd better wait to shine.

1381
01:36:51,350 --> 01:37:01,470
They'll tell you what is yours, but they'll take a bite.

1382
01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:03,450
Oh,

1383
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:10,490
I've got something in my throat.

1384
01:37:11,550 --> 01:37:20,570
I need to be alone while I suffer.

1385
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:23,150
Oh,

1386
01:37:26,430 --> 01:37:30,510
there's a hole inside my boat.

1387
01:37:31,210 --> 01:37:43,610
I need to stay afloat for the summer long.

1388
01:38:26,030 --> 01:38:30,210
Oh, I've got something in my throat.

1389
01:38:31,130 --> 01:38:40,130
I need to be alone while I suffer.

1390
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:42,910
Oh,

1391
01:38:46,270 --> 01:38:50,030
there's a hole inside my boat.

1392
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:59,990
I need to stay afloat for the summer.

1393
01:39:03,850 --> 01:39:09,570
Son, you'd better wait to fall.

1394
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:18,990
They'll tell you where to go, but they won't.

1395
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:32,070
070707 for the boss.

1396
01:39:42,050 --> 01:39:43,930
Ok, I'm over it.

1397
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:48,970
Okie doke, that was wait to fall.

1398
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:52,370
How long have I been?

1399
01:39:52,430 --> 01:39:53,350
Oh, only two hours.

1400
01:39:53,850 --> 01:39:54,870
Ok, not even.

1401
01:39:55,170 --> 01:39:56,570
Ok, cool.

1402
01:39:58,590 --> 01:40:02,830
How are we feeling about how I look, you guys?

1403
01:40:03,210 --> 01:40:04,470
Are we ok?

1404
01:40:04,770 --> 01:40:08,890
It's not too much of a difference, I feel, than before.

1405
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:16,950
I think I look mostly the same, so maybe it's not as dramatic, I suppose.

1406
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:23,830
Maybe it's not as dramatic, probably.

1407
01:40:30,110 --> 01:40:32,790
Maybe I think I'm more used to it than you guys, though.

1408
01:40:33,470 --> 01:40:38,290
Because I have been staring at it for like a month.

1409
01:40:41,290 --> 01:40:42,570
Sarah, how's your Cyberpunk?

1410
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:45,190
Dad, why do you always recommend songs?

1411
01:40:45,310 --> 01:40:46,930
I do not know, I feel terrible.

1412
01:40:47,050 --> 01:40:50,930
You always, always ask for songs, and I'm like, I'm sorry, I don't know.

1413
01:40:54,450 --> 01:40:59,250
Yours and my music tastes do not overlap at all.

1414
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:05,610
Ok, next one.

1415
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:09,310
Oh my gosh, I can't believe you guys like wanting me to sing this song.

1416
01:41:10,790 --> 01:41:13,850
It's like the most old person song ever.

1417
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:19,790
I think I don't have to change the key, but I might have to sing it high up, though.

1418
01:41:23,330 --> 01:41:24,590
Old people song.

1419
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:41,910
I'm looking for the county.

1420
01:41:44,070 --> 01:41:49,090
And I drive the main road.

1421
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:56,550
Searching in the sun for another overload.

1422
01:41:58,590 --> 01:42:01,930
I hear you singing in the wire.

1423
01:42:04,290 --> 01:42:08,510
I can hear you through the wire.

1424
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:19,770
And the witch's alignment is still on the line.

1425
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:30,860
I know I need a small vacation.

1426
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:37,560
But it don't look like rain.

1427
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:44,340
And if it snows, that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain.

1428
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:51,340
And I need you more than want you.

1429
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:57,340
And I want you for all time.

1430
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:07,440
And the witch's alignment is still on the line.

1431
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:23,660
It's like one of my favorite lyrics actually ever written.

1432
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:26,080
At one bar.

1433
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:27,200
It's so pretty.

1434
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:29,580
It makes my heart cute.

1435
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:33,640
I think I say it again here.

1436
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:34,740
Yeah!

1437
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:38,800
And I need you more than want you.

1438
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:43,880
And I want you for all time.

1439
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:55,140
And the witch's alignment is still on the line.

1440
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:35,180
That was the witch's alignment.

1441
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:37,380
Oh my gosh.

1442
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:38,800
Such a good song.

1443
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:40,220
It's so good.

1444
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:47,320
Like I said, that one, that lyric part is like some of my favorite lyrics of all time.

1445
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:49,840
I don't know, it just feels so poetic.

1446
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:51,620
It makes me feel things.

1447
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:58,460
It makes me feel like, oh my gosh, this is... cute.

1448
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:01,360
Cute!

1449
01:45:03,620 --> 01:45:05,720
I really want to stay at your house.

1450
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:07,000
What do you mean by that, Tuna?

1451
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:11,700
Tuna.

1452
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:12,300
Tuna!

1453
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:18,080
What do you mean by that?

1454
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:22,880
Invisible by Duran Duran.

1455
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:23,600
Oh my gosh!

1456
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:27,340
Thank you for the haka!

1457
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,040
Haka, thank you.

1458
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:30,500
I remember listening to this.

1459
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:33,300
And then not learning it.

1460
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:34,440
Oh, invisible.

1461
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:34,620
Invisible.

1462
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:40,160
Hold on, let me listen to it real quick.

1463
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:42,660
Let me see if I remember any of it.

1464
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:46,580
Hold on.

1465
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:48,100
I'm listening.

1466
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:49,040
Hold on.

1467
01:45:56,770 --> 01:45:58,410
Sorry if my song recommendation wasn't good.

1468
01:45:58,550 --> 01:45:59,770
What are you talking about, Nan?

1469
01:45:59,890 --> 01:46:00,790
It's not that it's not good.

1470
01:46:00,810 --> 01:46:01,610
I just don't know.

1471
01:46:01,890 --> 01:46:03,110
I'm sure your songs are awesome.

1472
01:46:04,630 --> 01:46:05,610
Sorry, it's me.

1473
01:46:06,690 --> 01:46:07,370
It's not you.

1474
01:46:14,210 --> 01:46:16,090
I think I remember just the chorus.

1475
01:46:20,170 --> 01:46:21,410
I want to hear her sing that too.

1476
01:46:21,470 --> 01:46:22,190
What are you talking about?

1477
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:38,510
Tuna's request is a song from Cyberpunk.

1478
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:50,390
Yeah, I only remember the chorus.

1479
01:46:58,070 --> 01:46:58,650
What?

1480
01:47:01,030 --> 01:47:02,710
A golden hour and it's original key?

1481
01:47:02,970 --> 01:47:04,330
I can't do original key.

1482
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:05,390
Are you crazy?

1483
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:07,450
Like, what?

1484
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:19,360
Okay,

1485
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:23,840
I promise.

1486
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:29,580
We'll do a Metal Gear themed karaoke and when I do, this will be on there, okay?

1487
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:31,780
I promise.

1488
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:33,380
I promise.

1489
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:35,640
Pinky promise.

1490
01:47:35,780 --> 01:47:37,140
Break your promise, break your pinky, okay?

1491
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:39,160
I promise, promise, okay?

1492
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:43,880
Break your promise, break your pinky.

1493
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:55,080
Let me see if this is actually...

1494
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:57,120
Okay.

1495
01:47:58,640 --> 01:47:59,700
This should be good.

1496
01:49:20,810 --> 01:49:21,990
Wait, this part.

1497
01:49:53,370 --> 01:49:57,530
It's been like, probably 10 years since I've listened to this song.

1498
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:20,380
Contains

1499
01:50:51,490 --> 01:51:53,800
I don't remember this part.

1500
01:53:48,410 --> 01:53:50,510
Sorry, I completely forgot the middle of that song.

1501
01:53:52,870 --> 01:53:54,210
Whoopsie, whoopsie daisy.

1502
01:53:55,090 --> 01:53:59,570
Like I said, it's been a long time since I've listened to it.

1503
01:53:59,830 --> 01:54:02,210
Okay, let's hope that I have enough yen for JP songs.

1504
01:54:02,290 --> 01:54:03,810
Otherwise, I can do...

1505
01:54:05,090 --> 01:54:08,110
That will be on...

1506
01:54:08,110 --> 01:54:08,770
YouTube.

1507
01:54:11,230 --> 01:54:14,470
Do you know Katamari Mambo or Roll Me In?

1508
01:54:14,590 --> 01:54:16,030
I don't think so.

1509
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:17,770
I'm sorry.

1510
01:54:18,230 --> 01:54:19,410
Don't dream it's over.

1511
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:21,630
I can do that one.

1512
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:26,780
Later.

1513
01:54:28,020 --> 01:54:29,820
I don't know, can you guys hear the joy sound?

1514
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:34,660
Wait, hold on.

1515
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:36,520
Can you hear it?

1516
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:39,460
Yeah, it's not echoed, right?

1517
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:45,320
Yeah, okay, now we're good.

1518
01:54:48,300 --> 01:54:50,380
Oh, they're doing a free period.

1519
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:53,340
Let's see what songs are free.

1520
01:54:54,380 --> 01:54:55,900
Okay, let's go.

1521
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:01,320
Let's see what songs are free.

1522
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:03,380
It's only like certain...

1523
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:05,020
Sorry, certain songs.

1524
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:08,960
Let's see...

1525
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:11,240
Oh wait, would it help if you guys saw too?

1526
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:14,920
It's gonna be in front of me though.

1527
01:55:19,140 --> 01:55:20,700
Put it like right down there.

1528
01:55:21,860 --> 01:55:22,620
I can scoot over.

1529
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,900
I'm getting away from you stinkies.

1530
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:25,980
Yes.

1531
01:55:30,470 --> 01:55:30,890
Oh,

1532
01:55:35,410 --> 01:55:37,450
is that it?

1533
01:55:39,610 --> 01:55:40,630
This is all of them?

1534
01:55:40,870 --> 01:55:41,370
That's it?

1535
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:53,080
Like I know some of these, but I don't know how to sing them.

1536
01:56:03,950 --> 01:56:04,890
Okay, nevermind.

1537
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:07,170
I have to spend money.

1538
01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:12,310
I have to spend money.

1539
01:56:14,590 --> 01:56:15,070
Liz!

1540
01:56:15,910 --> 01:56:16,850
Is that actually you?

1541
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:25,480
Is that actually her?

1542
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:35,000
I was gushing about you earlier.

1543
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:39,320
I thought she would have like a little checkmark though, right?

1544
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:43,180
Wouldn't she have a checkmark?

1545
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,560
Hold on, I'm gonna go to her channel.

1546
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:51,860
She didn't yesterday.

1547
01:56:52,100 --> 01:56:52,560
Oh, really?

1548
01:56:53,980 --> 01:56:55,460
Wait, she was in my chat yesterday too?

1549
01:56:57,460 --> 01:56:59,020
Oh, she doesn't have a checkmark.

1550
01:56:59,360 --> 01:56:59,800
Liz!

1551
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:01,740
Oh my goodness.

1552
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:05,660
It's an honor to see you.

1553
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:09,780
You didn't know?

1554
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:10,760
I didn't see her.

1555
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:12,160
Oh, I feel so bad.

1556
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:13,400
I was so nervous.

1557
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:15,820
I wasn't really looking so much at chat sometimes.

1558
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:18,580
I was nervous.

1559
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:19,740
I was nervous.

1560
01:57:30,590 --> 01:57:31,810
She called you princess.

1561
01:57:32,070 --> 01:57:33,390
She's like the sweetest ever.

1562
01:57:33,910 --> 01:57:35,130
She keeps calling me sweetheart.

1563
01:57:36,470 --> 01:57:38,910
And she says it on stream too, and every time I'm like...

1564
01:57:43,490 --> 01:57:46,230
Glad to be a Minto member on my birthday.

1565
01:57:46,570 --> 01:57:47,690
Muhal and happy birthday!

1566
01:57:48,790 --> 01:57:50,750
Happy birthday to you.

1567
01:57:51,030 --> 01:57:52,770
Happy birthday to you.

1568
01:57:52,990 --> 01:57:56,490
Happy birthday Muhal and happy birthday to you.

1569
01:57:58,310 --> 01:58:01,870
I was having a great time with your peeps and chat before Halloween.

1570
01:58:04,150 --> 01:58:06,490
I hope they weren't too freaky to you.

1571
01:58:07,930 --> 01:58:09,910
I hope they weren't too freaky to you.

1572
01:58:15,330 --> 01:58:16,950
Oh my gosh.

1573
01:58:17,010 --> 01:58:21,650
I haven't been... I haven't stopped repeating your Blackbird cover.

1574
01:58:21,910 --> 01:58:22,750
Oh my gosh.

1575
01:58:23,510 --> 01:58:24,650
Oh my gosh.

1576
01:58:24,670 --> 01:58:25,530
It's so beautiful.

1577
01:58:26,430 --> 01:58:27,930
If you guys haven't listened to it, please.

1578
01:58:28,350 --> 01:58:29,470
It's so good.

1579
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:34,880
They were awesome?

1580
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:37,260
Good.

1581
01:58:41,660 --> 01:58:43,140
I can't stop the loneliness.

1582
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:43,920
Who's that by?

1583
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:45,600
Mekanoid Prime.

1584
01:58:45,900 --> 01:58:46,640
Welcome to membership.

1585
01:58:46,820 --> 01:58:47,480
Thank you.

1586
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:53,020
Thanks for taking the time to listen.

1587
01:58:53,120 --> 01:58:53,720
Of course.

1588
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:55,660
So beautiful.

1589
01:58:58,860 --> 01:59:00,040
That's so, so nice.

1590
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:01,260
Oh, you're messaging me.

1591
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:01,920
Oh, it's me.

1592
01:59:05,060 --> 01:59:06,200
Thank you for confirming.

1593
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:19,080
What was I... Oh, JP songs.

1594
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:20,360
I don't know what to sing now.

1595
01:59:30,970 --> 01:59:32,930
Ask... Oh, I'm nervous though.

1596
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:39,650
Liz, if you're still here, if you're still here, stay with me.

1597
01:59:39,690 --> 01:59:40,430
Oh, I can do that one.

1598
01:59:43,170 --> 01:59:46,570
Well, I was only going to do it today, but I already did do it.

1599
01:59:46,570 --> 01:59:51,570
Would it be okay... I guess I'll do an encore later if she's okay with it.

1600
01:59:51,990 --> 01:59:52,570
I am.

1601
01:59:52,950 --> 01:59:56,030
Would you be okay if I did your...

1602
01:59:56,730 --> 01:59:57,490
Okay, good.

1603
01:59:57,590 --> 01:59:58,010
Good one.

1604
01:59:58,450 --> 02:00:02,910
Would you be okay if I use your version of the karaoke again?

1605
02:00:03,490 --> 02:00:04,510
More than okay?

1606
02:00:07,490 --> 02:00:08,370
Okay, guys.

1607
02:00:08,450 --> 02:00:12,530
Today will be the last... Today will be the last time that I use it.

1608
02:00:14,030 --> 02:00:15,550
Since she's okay with it.

1609
02:00:16,730 --> 02:00:20,390
Hopefully though we can, I don't know, sing again together in the future.

1610
02:00:20,590 --> 02:00:21,070
I don't know.

1611
02:00:24,810 --> 02:00:26,350
What if I just search stay with me.

1612
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:31,020
Okay, hold on.

1613
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:32,480
Let me write down some of these so I don't forget.

1614
02:00:33,020 --> 02:00:33,840
Love EXE.

1615
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:36,440
Always good to do haoko.

1616
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:45,440
She said you can use it whenever.

1617
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:45,540
But...

1618
02:00:45,540 --> 02:00:51,200
But it was a special thing, you guys.

1619
02:00:51,540 --> 02:00:52,500
I can't use it all the time.

1620
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:54,000
It won't become so special anymore.

1621
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:55,600
It was a special thing.

1622
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:56,820
But thank you.

1623
02:00:56,980 --> 02:00:57,860
Thank you, ARB!

1624
02:01:03,180 --> 02:01:03,460
Okay.

1625
02:01:05,780 --> 02:01:06,180
Utaimasu.

1626
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:06,680
Nihongo.

1627
02:01:12,620 --> 02:01:13,420
The e-shop.

1628
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:13,840
Hold on.

1629
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:16,320
I forgot that I have to pay.

1630
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:17,200
Oh, gosh.

1631
02:01:17,300 --> 02:01:17,500
Wait.

1632
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:19,180
Hopefully I have the money.

1633
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:22,680
Hopefully I have enough yen.

1634
02:01:31,380 --> 02:01:32,300
90 days.

1635
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:33,040
No, no, no.

1636
02:01:33,300 --> 02:01:33,580
Okay.

1637
02:01:34,140 --> 02:01:35,240
Let's do 3 hours.

1638
02:01:35,740 --> 02:01:37,740
How much yen do I have?

1639
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:54,660
I don't have enough money.

1640
02:01:56,120 --> 02:01:57,960
I have to get another...

1641
02:01:58,540 --> 02:02:00,240
I have to get another card.

1642
02:02:03,320 --> 02:02:05,500
I have 220 yen.

1643
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:10,590
No, no, no, no, no.

1644
02:02:10,710 --> 02:02:12,610
You guys, it's not a matter of like...

1645
02:02:12,610 --> 02:02:14,650
It's not a matter of sending money.

1646
02:02:14,790 --> 02:02:16,290
It's a matter of me having to...

1647
02:02:17,730 --> 02:02:22,330
Usually I like ask a friend in Japan to get me an e-shop card.

1648
02:02:24,250 --> 02:02:25,950
But I didn't think about it.

1649
02:02:31,490 --> 02:02:32,110
It's okay.

1650
02:02:32,170 --> 02:02:33,330
I can still sing this song.

1651
02:02:34,470 --> 02:02:37,370
But maybe my options are also a little bit more limited.

1652
02:02:40,170 --> 02:02:46,670
Because I can't sing like official versions or I will get the karaoke taken down.

1653
02:02:47,770 --> 02:02:48,450
No!

1654
02:02:50,430 --> 02:02:51,590
Oh, man.

1655
02:02:52,810 --> 02:02:53,870
I'm so sorry, guys.

1656
02:02:54,130 --> 02:02:56,730
That's my fault for not checking before stream.

1657
02:02:59,410 --> 02:03:00,650
That's my fault.

1658
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:07,940
VTuber no money.

1659
02:03:08,380 --> 02:03:09,560
VTuber no money.

1660
02:03:18,070 --> 02:03:20,250
To you.

1661
02:03:21,090 --> 02:03:25,310
Yes, my love, to you.

1662
02:03:25,950 --> 02:03:29,410
Yes, my love, to you.

1663
02:03:30,330 --> 02:03:31,350
To you.

1664
02:03:32,530 --> 02:03:34,410
To you.

1665
02:03:34,410 --> 02:03:35,690
To you.

1666
02:04:04,710 --> 02:04:06,690
To you.

1667
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:13,270
To you.

1668
02:04:59,230 --> 02:05:00,370
That was Aria.

1669
02:05:00,370 --> 02:05:00,590
Here we go.

1670
02:05:13,150 --> 02:05:20,650
恋と愛とは違うの 昨夜言われた そんな気もするわ

1671
02:05:25,770 --> 02:05:30,550
二度目の冬が来て 離れていった あなたの心

1672
02:05:34,690 --> 02:05:48,650
振り返ればいつも そこにあなたを 感じていたの Stay with me 真夜中のドアを叩き

1673
02:06:06,070 --> 02:06:07,730
Oh my gosh, I couldn't breathe for a second.

1674
02:07:16,610 --> 02:07:22,350
Oh my gosh, I couldn't breathe for a second.

1675
02:07:52,350 --> 02:07:53,890
Stay with me.

1676
02:07:53,990 --> 02:07:56,430
I knocked on the midnight door.

1677
02:07:59,350 --> 02:08:02,150
I cried out, don't go home.

1678
02:08:04,950 --> 02:08:09,050
That season is right in front of me.

1679
02:08:09,550 --> 02:08:12,730
Stay with me.

1680
02:08:18,170 --> 02:08:19,170
Stay with me.

1681
02:08:19,770 --> 02:08:20,710
Welcome back, master and mistress.

1682
02:08:25,570 --> 02:08:26,710
I think it was Kuro.

1683
02:08:27,210 --> 02:08:27,650
Thank you.

1684
02:08:27,750 --> 02:08:29,050
I think I remember the name, right?

1685
02:08:30,610 --> 02:08:31,330
Thank you.

1686
02:08:31,750 --> 02:08:33,250
Hello everybody, I'm Mint Fighter.

1687
02:08:33,430 --> 02:08:34,970
I'm a ghost made vtuber.

1688
02:08:35,550 --> 02:08:35,950
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

1689
02:08:38,610 --> 02:08:39,550
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

1690
02:08:39,590 --> 02:08:40,290
That was... Oh!

1691
02:08:41,090 --> 02:08:42,530
I haven't been updating the list.

1692
02:08:45,030 --> 02:08:47,470
After Lonely Rolling Star, what did I do?

1693
02:08:47,810 --> 02:08:48,590
What did I sing?

1694
02:08:52,810 --> 02:08:54,270
What did I sing?

1695
02:08:57,070 --> 02:08:57,550
Nothing?

1696
02:08:59,070 --> 02:09:00,610
Oh, really?

1697
02:09:01,870 --> 02:09:03,570
I could die happy now thinking of my dovecore?

1698
02:09:03,750 --> 02:09:04,090
C2!

1699
02:09:04,970 --> 02:09:05,370
CC!

1700
02:09:06,090 --> 02:09:07,010
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

1701
02:09:07,770 --> 02:09:08,290
Oh, okay.

1702
02:09:12,550 --> 02:09:13,930
There's a song I want to sing.

1703
02:09:15,230 --> 02:09:17,570
I don't know if I'll be able to.

1704
02:09:18,630 --> 02:09:19,970
I might forget some in the middle.

1705
02:09:20,090 --> 02:09:20,590
Is that okay?

1706
02:09:22,610 --> 02:09:24,730
Is it okay if I forget some in the middle?

1707
02:09:30,070 --> 02:09:32,630
Oh yeah, because I was trying to figure things out.

1708
02:09:33,530 --> 02:09:40,570
Actually, I heard this song first from Kiwawa.

1709
02:09:43,030 --> 02:09:44,950
So hopefully I can sing it well.

1710
02:09:45,130 --> 02:09:47,730
In fact, maybe I'll sing it with the key melody in the background.

1711
02:10:37,260 --> 02:10:38,900
It's so long!

1712
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:55,320
I don't know if I'll be able to.

1713
02:11:55,320 --> 02:11:55,360
Actually, I heard this song first from Kiwawa.

1714
02:12:39,770 --> 02:12:39,950
Actually, I heard this song first from Kiwawa.

1715
02:12:52,570 --> 02:13:06,570
I can't read!

1716
02:13:23,510 --> 02:13:24,070
Sorry.

1717
02:13:25,190 --> 02:13:32,760
I can't read even though I just sang stay with me.

1718
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:35,300
Now, I'm not.

1719
02:14:03,850 --> 02:14:05,150
Sorry.

1720
02:14:05,150 --> 02:14:07,690
I can't read even though I just sang stay with me.

1721
02:14:07,690 --> 02:14:07,690
Now, I'm not.

1722
02:14:07,690 --> 02:14:08,770
Sorry.

1723
02:14:08,770 --> 02:14:12,130
I can't read even though I just sang stay with me.

1724
02:14:12,130 --> 02:14:15,230
Now, I'm not.

1725
02:15:07,490 --> 02:15:10,290
That was...

1726
02:15:10,290 --> 02:15:11,670
Pretender question mark.

1727
02:15:12,750 --> 02:15:14,050
Sorry for the scoff.

1728
02:15:16,450 --> 02:15:17,450
Sorry for the scoff.

1729
02:15:28,650 --> 02:15:30,610
Beautiful Mito, thank you!

1730
02:15:30,930 --> 02:15:31,310
Thank you!

1731
02:15:31,450 --> 02:15:31,550
Thank you!

1732
02:15:31,870 --> 02:15:31,870
Thank you!

1733
02:15:31,990 --> 02:15:32,390
Thank you!

1734
02:15:36,290 --> 02:15:37,710
There was scoff?

1735
02:15:37,790 --> 02:15:38,230
Yes!

1736
02:15:40,170 --> 02:15:41,430
Yes, there was scoff.

1737
02:15:41,430 --> 02:15:42,630
Mod Erb, please.

1738
02:15:43,510 --> 02:15:47,170
Mod people that are mods of my chat.

1739
02:15:47,550 --> 02:15:48,770
So, I'm sorry.

1740
02:15:48,990 --> 02:15:52,390
I love Erb, but... Sorry.

1741
02:15:54,990 --> 02:15:57,110
Could an eShop card be sent through Super Chat?

1742
02:15:57,470 --> 02:15:59,190
Would it have to be a JP card?

1743
02:15:59,770 --> 02:16:06,210
I guess technically the code could be sent through Super Chat, but that wouldn't stop people from using the code.

1744
02:16:07,090 --> 02:16:08,210
Other than me!

1745
02:16:08,210 --> 02:16:08,390
Thank you!

1746
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:18,140
Thank you!

1747
02:16:18,180 --> 02:16:18,620
Thank you!

1748
02:16:20,720 --> 02:16:25,700
Yeah, YouTube doesn't have a VIP sort of thing like Twitch does.

1749
02:16:28,700 --> 02:16:29,660
But it's okay.

1750
02:16:30,420 --> 02:16:31,880
I see her around.

1751
02:16:33,060 --> 02:16:34,060
I see her, no worries.

1752
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:41,180
It would have to be in JP for the other thing.

1753
02:16:41,480 --> 02:16:41,800
Let me see.

1754
02:16:41,860 --> 02:16:43,520
I wonder if they have this as a karaoke.

1755
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:48,160
Oh, this is Utatte Mita, so maybe not.

1756
02:16:48,300 --> 02:16:48,580
Hold on.

1757
02:16:49,380 --> 02:16:52,280
Let me see if this one... This is a mad, but I think it's not a karaoke.

1758
02:16:56,450 --> 02:16:56,770
No.

1759
02:16:57,290 --> 02:16:58,850
Unfortunately, I can't do Love EXE.

1760
02:16:58,990 --> 02:16:59,490
There's no karaoke.

1761
02:16:59,570 --> 02:17:01,730
Wait, let me see if this person can hear them.

1762
02:17:01,730 --> 02:17:04,730
Yeah, I can.

1763
02:17:07,950 --> 02:17:12,730
Otherwise, I would love to do Love EXE.

1764
02:17:13,970 --> 02:17:15,250
I want to do this one though.

1765
02:17:15,670 --> 02:17:16,350
Hold on real quick.

1766
02:17:19,410 --> 02:17:19,830
Let me see.

1767
02:17:22,050 --> 02:17:23,910
It's not summer, but whatever.

1768
02:17:25,730 --> 02:17:26,290
Odori Iko!

1769
02:17:26,530 --> 02:17:27,450
Oh, I can do that one too.

1770
02:17:31,970 --> 02:17:33,190
Love EXE is amazing.

1771
02:17:33,230 --> 02:17:39,350
Next time when I have Japanese, like full joy sound, I will do.

1772
02:17:39,770 --> 02:17:40,730
So sorry, so sorry.

1773
02:17:42,050 --> 02:17:42,890
One second.

1774
02:17:45,130 --> 02:17:46,870
Let me check if this one...

1775
02:17:49,710 --> 02:17:51,530
I'm trying to find a good...

1776
02:17:52,750 --> 02:17:55,270
I don't want the guide melody for this song.

1777
02:17:55,810 --> 02:17:56,530
Hold on.

1778
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:00,340
Yen Card.

1779
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:02,280
Oh, it's not real.

1780
02:18:03,500 --> 02:18:06,220
I was like, oh guys, I'm not ready.

1781
02:18:06,680 --> 02:18:08,380
I have to prepare.

1782
02:18:08,900 --> 02:18:10,620
Someone else is going to steal it.

1783
02:18:11,360 --> 02:18:12,640
You got me, Dokutalk.

1784
02:18:16,100 --> 02:18:18,020
Sam, welcome to membership.

1785
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:18,760
Thank you!

1786
02:18:20,600 --> 02:18:21,380
Here we go.

02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:55,640
Thank you so much for the 10 gifts!

1792
02:22:57,840 --> 02:22:58,620
Thank you!

1793
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:00,580
Thank you, thank you.

1794
02:23:05,840 --> 02:23:08,440
Odoriko I have it somewhere.

1795
02:23:09,640 --> 02:23:10,320
Somewhere.

1796
02:23:10,860 --> 02:23:11,240
Oh no.

1797
02:23:11,940 --> 02:23:12,340
Wait.

1798
02:23:15,460 --> 02:23:16,140
LUDE!

1799
02:23:16,940 --> 02:23:17,620
Gravity?

1800
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:21,620
Oh gosh, I think I remember it.

1801
02:23:23,080 --> 02:23:23,860
Let me write it down.

1802
02:23:25,620 --> 02:23:28,260
Why are you asking for such a soft song?

1803
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,300
You have a soft spot.

1804
02:23:30,300 --> 02:23:32,880
Behind all that LUDE-ness.

1805
02:23:33,440 --> 02:23:34,380
There's somewhere soft.

1806
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:36,340
In your heart.

1807
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:37,780
Specifically.

1808
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:40,840
Radiac!

1809
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:41,760
Thank you for the 30 gifts!

1810
02:23:45,490 --> 02:23:46,970
Thank you, thank you.

1811
02:23:51,750 --> 02:23:52,730
Hey guys!

1812
02:23:53,070 --> 02:23:54,150
Thank you for the...

1813
02:23:54,150 --> 02:23:55,730
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1814
02:23:57,010 --> 02:23:58,250
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1815
02:23:58,250 --> 02:24:02,970
Where did I put the karaoke?

1816
02:24:04,210 --> 02:24:04,950
One second.

1817
02:24:05,830 --> 02:24:07,590
Is it under this folder?

1818
02:24:09,170 --> 02:24:09,730
Maybe.

1819
02:24:11,090 --> 02:24:12,050
Ah yes!

1820
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:17,260
The lyrics though.

1821
02:24:18,640 --> 02:24:20,960
Nico Nico Kumi Kyoku for finale!

1822
02:24:22,860 --> 02:24:24,340
Maybe not today.

1823
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:27,540
Maybe not today.

1824
02:24:32,990 --> 02:24:35,230
I'm starting to get a little tired actually.

1825
02:24:35,910 --> 02:24:37,910
Actually mostly hungry which makes me tired.

1826
02:24:39,510 --> 02:24:39,990
Okay.

1827
02:24:42,370 --> 02:24:44,690
I'm going to go back to English songs after this one.

1828
02:24:44,770 --> 02:24:46,390
So don't worry if you were like...

1829
02:24:46,390 --> 02:24:48,050
She missed an English song.

1830
02:24:48,390 --> 02:24:50,210
Because I have a few English songs.

1831
02:24:51,010 --> 02:24:51,610
That I missed too.

1832
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:03,780
Are those real?

1833
02:25:03,780 --> 02:25:04,760
Wait!

1834
02:25:08,850 --> 02:25:09,890
Are those real?

1835
02:25:10,690 --> 02:25:11,310
Are those real?

1836
02:25:15,620 --> 02:25:16,180
No!

1837
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:17,360
No way!

1838
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:18,360
No, no, no!

1839
02:25:21,500 --> 02:25:22,520
I lost it.

1840
02:25:22,620 --> 02:25:23,500
I have it.

1841
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:28,960
Are these real?

1842
02:25:29,740 --> 02:25:30,680
Check your e-mail?

1843
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:32,260
What do you mean check my e-mail?

1844
02:25:33,580 --> 02:25:34,540
Oh my God!

1845
02:25:35,140 --> 02:25:35,980
Oh my God!

1846
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:36,660
Stop!

1847
02:25:37,220 --> 02:25:37,680
Hold on!

1848
02:25:40,860 --> 02:25:42,760
I need to get the...

1849
02:25:55,180 --> 02:25:56,280
Cancel, cancel, cancel.

1850
02:25:56,660 --> 02:25:57,420
Wait, wait, wait.

1851
02:25:57,480 --> 02:25:58,020
Are those real?

1852
02:25:58,860 --> 02:25:59,460
Oh my God.

1853
02:26:04,740 --> 02:26:06,840
Wait, don't look at the screen.

1854
02:26:07,880 --> 02:26:08,780
Oh my gosh.

1855
02:26:09,460 --> 02:26:10,280
3 hours.

1856
02:26:13,460 --> 02:26:14,580
Play card!

1857
02:26:15,240 --> 02:26:16,360
Play, play, play card.

1858
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:17,760
Oh no!

1859
02:26:18,060 --> 02:26:19,340
This is really slow.

1860
02:26:20,960 --> 02:26:22,180
Oh my gosh!

1861
02:26:22,180 --> 02:26:24,440
Oh my gosh.

1862
02:26:24,600 --> 02:26:26,020
If these...Oh my God.

1863
02:26:30,080 --> 02:26:30,760
Is this?

1864
02:26:30,940 --> 02:26:31,160
Wait.

1865
02:26:34,240 --> 02:26:35,180
I don't know.

1866
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:36,660
C?

1867
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:39,120
Wait, I don't think this is correct.

1868
02:26:41,960 --> 02:26:42,440
Wait.

1869
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:42,920
1...

1870
02:26:43,700 --> 02:26:44,180
No!

1871
02:26:44,840 --> 02:26:45,680
That one!

1872
02:26:45,860 --> 02:26:47,200
The first one didn't work.

1873
02:26:47,340 --> 02:26:47,760
Oh my God.

1874
02:26:47,980 --> 02:26:48,580
Back, back, back.

1875
02:26:50,200 --> 02:26:51,420
Oh my gosh.

1876
02:26:57,060 --> 02:27:00,520
I gotta be faster than anybody else.

1877
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:01,820
Oh I don't know.

1878
02:27:02,280 --> 02:27:03,080
Oh gosh.

1879
02:27:03,160 --> 02:27:07,940
You guys shouldn't have posted in the chat.

1880
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:10,460
I can't even follow.

1881
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:11,360
Oh my gosh.

1882
02:27:16,340 --> 02:27:18,700
I don't want you to waste your money.

1883
02:27:18,940 --> 02:27:20,520
I don't want you to waste your money.

1884
02:27:21,100 --> 02:27:22,180
Oh my gosh.

1885
02:27:22,460 --> 02:27:23,580
OK, let's see if this works.

1886
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:27,920
But it's too much money!

1887
02:27:28,320 --> 02:27:30,920
It's 1,500 yen!

1888
02:27:31,140 --> 02:27:31,760
Oh my gosh.

1889
02:27:31,860 --> 02:27:32,800
Binary goes to...

1890
02:27:34,920 --> 02:27:38,540
You guys didn't...You guys didn't redeem it.

1891
02:27:40,060 --> 02:27:40,840
Oh my God!

1892
02:27:41,140 --> 02:27:42,280
Garlamo, you too!

1893
02:27:43,800 --> 02:27:46,660
Wait, can I...You guys, I'm gonna redeem it both.

1894
02:27:46,880 --> 02:27:47,680
I'm gonna redeem it.

1895
02:27:47,740 --> 02:27:48,120
Hold on.

1896
02:27:48,380 --> 02:27:48,780
Hold on.

1897
02:27:49,240 --> 02:27:50,940
I don't want you to waste your money.

1898
02:27:51,060 --> 02:27:52,200
I don't want you to waste your money.

1899
02:27:57,050 --> 02:27:58,870
Wait, how do I redeem another card?

1900
02:28:00,230 --> 02:28:00,870
Hold on.

1901
02:28:02,410 --> 02:28:03,590
Oh wait, I can do this.

1902
02:28:03,750 --> 02:28:04,710
I can go for the 30.

1903
02:28:05,190 --> 02:28:05,850
3,000.

1904
02:28:06,650 --> 02:28:07,610
And then just put in the card.

1905
02:28:07,770 --> 02:28:08,290
Oh my gosh.

1906
02:28:08,310 --> 02:28:08,670
Oh my gosh.

1907
02:28:08,690 --> 02:28:09,010
Oh my gosh.

1908
02:28:09,010 --> 02:28:09,790
You guys are crazy.

1909
02:28:09,910 --> 02:28:11,370
I told you not to put it in the card!

1910
02:28:21,140 --> 02:28:21,900
Oh my gosh.

1911
02:28:22,120 --> 02:28:23,020
T-L-Y.

1912
02:28:23,260 --> 02:28:24,180
I'm doing it, Garlamo!

1913
02:28:25,930 --> 02:28:27,290
You guys, seriously.

1914
02:28:30,190 --> 02:28:30,790
Ah, OK.

1915
02:28:36,970 --> 02:28:37,470
Oh

1916
02:28:59,770 --> 02:29:00,510
my gosh.

1917
02:29:00,570 --> 02:29:01,570
Thank you guys.

1918
02:29:02,130 --> 02:29:04,370
You guys, you chat were so good.

1919
02:29:04,750 --> 02:29:05,730
Oh my gosh.

1920
02:29:06,110 --> 02:29:08,110
You guys didn't redeem it.

1921
02:29:08,110 --> 02:29:08,690
How?

1922
02:29:14,060 --> 02:29:14,680
Why?

1923
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:15,960
You guys are so good.

1924
02:29:16,880 --> 02:29:18,760
You guys are so good.

1925
02:29:19,060 --> 02:29:20,460
Oh my gosh.

1926
02:29:23,300 --> 02:29:25,300
You guys are so nice.

1927
02:29:33,560 --> 02:29:36,960
I can't believe you guys didn't redeem it before me.

1928
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:40,680
I can't believe you guys were so...

1929
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:44,960
We're so... We're so respectful.

1930
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:51,880
That never happens.

1931
02:29:55,170 --> 02:29:56,870
That never happens.

1932
02:29:56,930 --> 02:29:57,830
Oh my god.

1933
02:29:59,730 --> 02:30:03,230
There could have been anybody who like just...

1934
02:30:03,230 --> 02:30:07,290
Who just came into chat and was like...

1935
02:30:07,290 --> 02:30:08,810
Oh, I'm going to take that now.

1936
02:30:08,810 --> 02:30:14,460
Oh my god.

1937
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:19,280
Oh my gosh.

1938
02:30:19,380 --> 02:30:20,340
Thank you guys.

1939
02:30:20,500 --> 02:30:21,660
That's insane.

1940
02:30:23,360 --> 02:30:24,520
That's insane.

1941
02:30:24,600 --> 02:30:29,140
There's so many people here and a single person took it.

1942
02:30:31,060 --> 02:30:32,680
How is that possible?

1943
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:34,320
Oh my gosh.

1944
02:30:35,880 --> 02:30:37,900
I do have the best community.

1945
02:30:46,600 --> 02:30:47,560
Thank you.

1946
02:30:51,380 --> 02:30:52,760
Thank you guys.

1947
02:30:56,580 --> 02:31:02,060
You guys are actually the best.

1948
02:31:02,140 --> 02:31:03,780
I hope you didn't hear me just gulp right now.

1949
02:31:06,280 --> 02:31:07,660
You were so slow too.

1950
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:08,380
I know!

1951
02:31:09,140 --> 02:31:09,920
I know.

1952
02:31:10,060 --> 02:31:11,000
That's insane.

1953
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,560
Thank you for the 50 gifted.

1954
02:31:13,560 --> 02:31:14,960
Thank you so much.

1955
02:31:15,700 --> 02:31:17,180
Oh my gosh.

1956
02:31:18,240 --> 02:31:18,840
Wow.

1957
02:31:21,340 --> 02:31:23,840
I can say I love EXE now.

1958
02:31:25,360 --> 02:31:28,500
But I feel so bad too because...

1959
02:31:29,360 --> 02:31:29,960
Because...

1960
02:31:30,780 --> 02:31:36,520
I can only redeem for 3 hours but I probably will only go for like another 30 minutes.

1961
02:31:38,560 --> 02:31:40,520
I'm not going to go for so long.

1962
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:43,320
I can use it next time.

1963
02:31:43,340 --> 02:31:44,780
Is it okay if I use it next time?

1964
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:49,260
You guys sent too much.

1965
02:31:50,980 --> 02:31:52,220
Save it for later then?

1966
02:31:55,160 --> 02:31:55,920
It's okay.

1967
02:31:56,920 --> 02:31:57,360
Georgie!

1968
02:31:58,280 --> 02:31:58,720
Hi!

1969
02:32:01,240 --> 02:32:01,980
Georgie is here.

1970
02:32:02,080 --> 02:32:04,400
Georgie who is so one hell made my game.

1971
02:32:05,560 --> 02:32:05,880
John!

1972
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:06,880
Oh my gosh.

1973
02:32:06,900 --> 02:32:07,900
Thank you for the 50 gifted.

1974
02:32:08,080 --> 02:32:08,800
Thank you!

1975
02:32:09,360 --> 02:32:10,180
Tell the brand.

1976
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:10,940
Welcome to my membership.

1977
02:32:11,060 --> 02:32:11,760
Thank you!

1978
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:16,560
Did you guys beat the game?

1979
02:32:16,660 --> 02:32:18,260
I saw some people saying it was hard.

1980
02:32:20,620 --> 02:32:23,260
I'm just a lurker here but I salute to you Wisps.

1981
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:24,420
You're a Wisp too!

1982
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:26,200
What are you talking about?

1983
02:32:26,340 --> 02:32:26,700
Greg!

1984
02:32:26,900 --> 02:32:28,360
You've been here for 2 months!

1985
02:32:28,800 --> 02:32:29,940
You're a Wisp too!

1986
02:32:31,060 --> 02:32:32,220
What are you talking about?

1987
02:32:34,420 --> 02:32:35,460
Just a lurker?

1988
02:32:37,220 --> 02:32:39,200
That's... You're still here watching.

1989
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:41,320
That's more than enough.

1990
02:32:41,880 --> 02:32:42,400
Honestly.

1991
02:32:47,320 --> 02:32:50,680
Sorry, I got really...

1992
02:32:50,680 --> 02:32:52,820
Really emotional about that.

1993
02:32:54,720 --> 02:32:56,140
First time coming into your stream.

1994
02:32:56,800 --> 02:32:57,600
You have really sweet voice.

1995
02:32:57,680 --> 02:32:58,180
Keep on singing.

1996
02:32:58,300 --> 02:32:58,860
Thank you DD!

1997
02:32:59,460 --> 02:33:00,200
Thank you!

1998
02:33:06,480 --> 02:33:07,680
We do be lurking.

1999
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:11,960
Okay, I'm gonna save it for next time then.

2000
02:33:12,720 --> 02:33:13,240
Dog's drinks.

2001
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:14,580
Thank you for the 20!

2002
02:33:15,500 --> 02:33:16,980
Oh my gosh, you guys.

2003
02:33:17,720 --> 02:33:18,580
Everyone, welcome!

2004
02:33:19,180 --> 02:33:20,040
20XX welcome!

2005
02:33:20,780 --> 02:33:21,440
Lurker, I'm in love.

2006
02:33:24,420 --> 02:33:25,300
Shadow cross!

2007
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:26,920
Thank you for the 5 gifted.

2008
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:29,280
Oh my gosh, where is all this coming from?

2009
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:30,640
Lottie!

2010
02:33:30,640 --> 02:33:33,660
Thank you for the raid!

2011
02:33:43,740 --> 02:33:45,920
Oh my gosh, right now I'm a little...

2012
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:47,340
Oh gosh, you guys came in...

2013
02:33:47,340 --> 02:33:50,760
You guys came in at a silly time.

2014
02:33:53,320 --> 02:33:54,480
Thank you for all the gifted.

2015
02:33:54,720 --> 02:33:55,060
Thank you.

2016
02:33:55,380 --> 02:33:57,300
You guys came in at a silly time.

2017
02:34:00,060 --> 02:34:01,480
Just an occasional lurker.

2018
02:34:02,580 --> 02:34:04,240
Thank you, froggy.

2019
02:34:04,780 --> 02:34:05,740
Frozen froggy.

2020
02:34:09,160 --> 02:34:10,360
Thanks for all the gifted!

2021
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:11,200
Thank you!

2022
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:13,820
This is the most emotional Nintendo code redeem I've ever seen.

2023
02:34:14,180 --> 02:34:15,320
I think it will be...

2024
02:34:16,380 --> 02:34:18,420
The most ever, right?

2025
02:34:18,940 --> 02:34:20,380
And Ashes, I'll check my email.

2026
02:34:20,760 --> 02:34:21,880
Unless you wanna use that.

2027
02:34:22,540 --> 02:34:23,340
It's totally on you.

2028
02:34:23,700 --> 02:34:25,380
Actually, you just said check my email.

2029
02:34:25,560 --> 02:34:26,100
I'm assuming.

2030
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:27,680
I hope it's not.

2031
02:34:28,100 --> 02:34:30,080
If it is... Hold on, I'm checking my email.

2032
02:34:32,460 --> 02:34:33,560
I'm checking my email.

2033
02:34:33,740 --> 02:34:34,220
If it is...

2034
02:34:34,820 --> 02:34:35,800
You should use it.

2035
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:36,540
You should use it.

2036
02:34:37,020 --> 02:34:37,520
Oh my gosh.

2037
02:34:37,620 --> 02:34:38,600
Oh, Seymour!

2038
02:34:44,730 --> 02:34:45,830
I got your email.

2039
02:34:45,950 --> 02:34:46,430
Thank you.

2040
02:34:48,250 --> 02:34:50,250
Okay, I see it.

2041
02:34:50,630 --> 02:34:51,250
Thank you!

2042
02:34:52,650 --> 02:34:53,430
Thank you, Seymour.

2043
02:34:53,510 --> 02:34:54,170
Thank you, Carla1.

2044
02:34:54,330 --> 02:34:55,370
Thank you guys so much.

2045
02:34:56,250 --> 02:34:58,350
Okay, I was singing Odoriko.

2046
02:34:58,710 --> 02:35:00,290
Odoriko, Odoriko, Odoriko.

2047
02:35:01,710 --> 02:35:02,670
Odoriko, Odoriko.

2048
02:35:04,310 --> 02:35:05,790
I will sing it now for real.

2049
02:35:06,950 --> 02:35:08,150
Oh my gosh, wait.

2050
02:35:08,230 --> 02:35:10,450
I have to add suddenly Seymour to my list.

2051
02:35:15,830 --> 02:35:17,630
Garlamald, is there a song you want me to sing?

2052
02:35:20,430 --> 02:35:21,910
Is there a song you want me to sing?

2053
02:35:23,130 --> 02:35:25,730
Someone asked me to sing this earlier, but it's so embarrassing...

2054
02:35:25,730 --> 02:35:29,650
when there are people named the person in the song you're singing about in your chat.

2055
02:35:32,390 --> 02:35:33,910
This is live Muddy Laundry.

2056
02:35:34,010 --> 02:35:34,170
What?

2057
02:35:34,310 --> 02:35:34,990
No, you're not!

2058
02:35:35,410 --> 02:35:36,070
No, it's not!

2059
02:35:36,650 --> 02:35:37,990
How is it Muddy Laundry?

2060
02:35:39,030 --> 02:35:39,470
No!

2061
02:35:40,110 --> 02:35:41,450
FBI, turn away!

2062
02:35:42,110 --> 02:35:43,010
Close your eyes.

2063
02:35:45,530 --> 02:35:46,370
Are they closed?

2064
02:35:47,850 --> 02:35:48,710
Are they closed?

2065
02:35:49,670 --> 02:35:50,270
Close your eyes.

2066
02:35:54,350 --> 02:35:55,890
Okay, I sing Odoriko.

2067
02:35:58,330 --> 02:35:59,990
Okay, I sing Odoriko.

2068
02:36:00,730 --> 02:36:01,930
Yeah, this is legitimate business.

2069
02:36:02,030 --> 02:36:03,430
I'm just waiting on my numbers.

2070
02:36:05,310 --> 02:36:06,650
To get approved.

2071
02:36:07,150 --> 02:36:08,610
For it to be a real, real business.

2072
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:59,160
Hey, let's pick it up properly Before I break it and forget it Hey, if my future with that girl who started to spin If I could do it again somewhere else

2073
02:37:23,320 --> 02:37:29,140
Hey, if my future with that girl who started to spin

2074
02:37:54,240 --> 02:38:24,060
If I could do it again somewhere else Hey, if my future with that girl who started to spin Hey, if my future with that girl who started to spin If I could do it again somewhere else Hey, if my future with that girl who started to spin If I could do it again somewhere else

2075
02:38:37,620 --> 02:38:39,020
Dudududu...

2076
02:38:54,080 --> 02:39:22,540
If my future with that girl who started to spin If I could do it again somewhere else If I could do it again somewhere else Hey, if my future with that girl who started to spin If I could do it again somewhere else Hey, in what era will we live in love as always?

2077
02:39:23,780 --> 02:39:35,140
What will remain of us is the song of unchanging love Hey, in what era will we live in love as always?

2078
02:39:35,880 --> 02:39:40,800
What will remain of us is the song of unchanging love

2079
02:39:52,220 --> 02:39:52,660
Dudududu...

2080
02:40:04,300 --> 02:40:04,740
Odoriko!

2081
02:40:04,860 --> 02:40:05,280
Odoriko!

2082
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:09,920
Thank you!

2083
02:40:10,820 --> 02:40:11,360
Thank you!

2084

Thank you for the pick Minchi!

2088
02:40:14,640 --> 02:40:16,460
Yoshi is amazing and you can't tell me otherwise

2089
02:40:19,740 --> 02:40:30,160
I'm assuming... I'm not gonna assume that I'm your Yoshi, but I will say that your Yoshi is probably really cool Thank you for the 50!

2090
02:40:31,140 --> 02:40:32,020
Thank you!

2091
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:33,140

2092
02:40:33,580 --> 02:40:33,880
Thank you!

2093
02:40:35,100 --> 02:40:36,120
Oh, wait, hold on.

2094
02:40:36,180 --> 02:40:39,740
Oh, there we go So many gifts!

2095
02:40:39,900 --> 02:40:40,960
Holy cow!

2096
02:40:41,200 --> 02:40:44,220
I just saw how many gifts there have been today

2097
02:40:47,960 --> 02:40:56,430
You guys...

2098
02:40:56,430 --> 02:40:57,270
Okie-dokie.

2099
02:40:57,510 --> 02:40:59,210
I'm gonna go back to some English songs.

2100
02:40:59,530 --> 02:41:00,690
This one was a while ago

2101
02:41:04,110 --> 02:41:05,630
Did Garlemald say a song?

2102
02:41:06,850 --> 02:41:07,970
Did you say a song?

2103
02:41:08,450 --> 02:41:08,670
You?

2104
02:41:09,090 --> 02:41:09,350
Hello?

2105
02:41:16,600 --> 02:41:19,620
Okie-dokie See ya!

2106
02:41:19,800 --> 02:41:20,480
Thanks for the gifted!

2107
02:41:27,380 --> 02:41:29,480
Ah... Ah... Ah...

2108
02:41:30,500 --> 02:41:32,240
He said to sing what you like?

2109
02:41:34,960 --> 02:41:35,700
Thank you!

2110
02:41:35,860 --> 02:41:36,500
Thank you!

2111
02:41:40,120 --> 02:41:40,680
Thank you!

2112
02:41:40,880 --> 02:41:41,000
Thank you!

2113
02:41:41,040 --> 02:41:42,200
Can you say thanks for the 5 gifted?

2114
02:41:42,840 --> 02:41:49,720
Ok I think I have to turn this one up, like 2 key

2115
02:42:06,910 --> 02:42:36,410
There is freedom within, there is freedom without Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost But you'll never see the end of the road while you're traveling with me Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over Hey now,

2116
02:42:36,650 --> 02:43:18,070
hey now, when the world comes in They come, they come, to build a wall between us We know they won't win Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof In the paper today, tales of war and always But you turn right over to the TV page Hey now,

2117
02:43:18,190 --> 02:43:40,230
hey now, don't dream it's over Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in They come, they come, to build a wall between us We know they won't win Now

2118
02:44:18,750 --> 02:44:53,290
I'm walking ahead, to the beat of a drum And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart Only shadows ahead, barely clearing the roof Get to know the feeling of liberation and release Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in They come,

2119
02:44:53,570 --> 02:45:01,250
they come, to build a wall between us We know they can't win

2120
02:45:08,080 --> 02:45:46,420
Win Yay, that was don't dream it's over

2121
02:45:49,460 --> 02:45:52,280
Ok, ok, ok

2122
02:45:55,320 --> 02:46:07,220
This was requested a while ago, we'll try to remember it Part of me doesn't remember quite much of it, Lewood, I'm sorry I'm sorry

2123
02:46:20,140 --> 02:46:49,800
Something always brings me back to you It never takes too long Time warp No matter what I say or do You still feel you here till the moment I'm gone You hold me without touch.

2124
02:46:51,020 --> 02:46:56,180
You keep me without chains.

2125
02:46:57,220 --> 02:47:08,020
I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love and not feel your rain.

2126
02:47:09,240 --> 02:47:15,220
Set me free, leave me be.

2127
02:47:15,580 --> 02:47:20,660
I don't wanna fall another moment into your gravity.

2128
02:47:21,500 --> 02:47:32,020
Here I am, and I stand so tall, just the way that I'm supposed to be.

2129
02:47:32,020 --> 02:47:39,040
But you're onto me, and all over me.

2130
02:47:43,080 --> 02:47:46,440
Oh, you love me, cause I'm fragile.

2131
02:47:47,980 --> 02:47:52,420
When I thought that I was strong.

2132
02:47:53,360 --> 02:48:03,620
But you touch me for a little while, and all my fragile strength is gone.

2133
02:48:06,140 --> 02:48:11,540
Set me free, leave me be.

2134
02:48:12,080 --> 02:48:16,980
I don't wanna fall another moment into your gravity.

2135
02:48:16,980 --> 02:48:28,560
Here I am, and I stand so tall, just the way that I'm supposed to be.

2136
02:48:28,760 --> 02:48:35,520
But you're onto me, and all over me.

2137
02:48:39,320 --> 02:48:40,960
Wait, I don't remember this part.

2138
02:48:42,320 --> 02:48:45,900
Make you search for everything I've lost.

2139
02:48:46,080 --> 02:48:47,180
Sorry, I need the vocals here.

2140
02:48:47,260 --> 02:48:52,240
You're on the ground, but you're neither friend nor foe.

2141
02:48:52,540 --> 02:48:54,820
I can't seem to let you go.

2142
02:48:55,540 --> 02:49:00,520
The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down.

2143
02:49:12,680 --> 02:49:17,720
You're keeping me down.

2144
02:49:21,890 --> 02:49:24,630
Sorry, I always forget that part.

2145
02:49:25,790 --> 02:49:30,130
You're onto me, and all over

2146
02:49:35,140 --> 02:49:35,560
me.

2147
02:49:35,760 --> 02:49:39,500
Something always brings me back to you.

2148
02:49:40,980 --> 02:49:45,840
It never takes too long.

2149
02:49:54,810 --> 02:49:57,090
Sorry, I've gotta relearn this song.

2150
02:49:57,150 --> 02:49:58,550
It's been a long time since I've heard it.

2151
02:49:58,870 --> 02:50:00,990
I know I sang it before, but...

2152
02:50:05,960 --> 02:50:06,460
Gravity...

2153
02:50:07,880 --> 02:50:09,500
Writing my thesis today?

2154
02:50:11,100 --> 02:50:12,100
Good luck!

2155
02:50:14,860 --> 02:50:16,420
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

2156
02:50:16,980 --> 02:50:18,300
First time catching a stream?

2157
02:50:18,400 --> 02:50:18,640
Wow.

2158
02:50:19,120 --> 02:50:22,440
I can say I really regret never catching one sooner.

2159
02:50:22,620 --> 02:50:23,140
Your voice is incredible.

2160
02:50:24,320 --> 02:50:25,280
Thank you!

2161
02:50:26,100 --> 02:50:27,320
It's all an illusion.

2162
02:50:29,460 --> 02:50:31,320
I cosplay as a good singer.

2163
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:32,500
I'm not a good singer.

2164
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:34,740
I pretend I wish I were a good singer.

2165
02:50:36,800 --> 02:50:38,300
I wish, I wish.

2166
02:50:39,200 --> 02:50:40,500
I wish, but thank you.

2167
02:50:40,580 --> 02:50:41,300
I appreciate it.

2168
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:47,260
What's the difference between the musical and the film?

2169
02:50:47,760 --> 02:50:48,520
I don't know.

2170
02:50:48,660 --> 02:50:48,960
We'll see.

2171
02:50:51,380 --> 02:50:53,340
I gotta put on my accent.

2172
02:50:53,820 --> 02:50:55,960
I gotta put on my accent for this.

2173
02:50:56,480 --> 02:50:59,320
Because I gotta really channel Audrey.

2174
02:51:00,640 --> 02:51:02,940
I gotta really channel Audrey with this.

2175
02:51:05,400 --> 02:51:08,100
I'm just a downtown girl.

2176
02:51:08,100 --> 02:51:08,180
Mascara?

2177
02:51:10,160 --> 02:51:11,620
Oh, this is Seymour.

2178
02:51:12,020 --> 02:51:20,480
Thank you, Seymour.

2179
02:51:28,340 --> 02:51:31,800
Now they're okay?

2180
02:51:31,920 --> 02:51:33,180
Really, Seymour?

2181
02:51:38,660 --> 02:51:41,620
He's standing beside you.

2182
02:51:42,340 --> 02:51:42,920
Beside me?

2183
02:51:43,240 --> 02:51:43,940
Little old me?

2184
02:51:43,960 --> 02:51:45,720
You don't need no makeup.

2185
02:51:45,940 --> 02:51:47,940
Good, because I'm barefaced today.

2186
02:51:48,160 --> 02:51:51,100
Don't have to pretend.

2187
02:51:55,140 --> 02:51:56,980
Suddenly, Seymour...

2188
02:51:57,780 --> 02:52:01,860
is here to provide you...

2189
02:52:03,060 --> 02:52:05,520
sweet understanding.

2190
02:52:05,520 --> 02:52:07,520
Suddenly, Seymour...

2191
02:52:35,520 --> 02:52:36,600
is here to provide me.

2192
02:52:36,600 --> 02:52:39,740
He don't give me orders.

2193
02:52:42,120 --> 02:52:46,540
He don't condescend.

2194
02:52:47,040 --> 02:52:50,120
Suddenly, Seymour...

2195
02:52:50,120 --> 02:52:55,480
is here to provide me...

2196
02:52:55,480 --> 02:52:58,240
sweet understanding.

2197
02:53:00,520 --> 02:53:02,280
Seymour's my friend.

2198
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:09,540
Tell me the bad times are clean washed away.

2199
02:53:09,820 --> 02:53:13,440
Please understand that it's still strange and frightening.

2200
02:53:13,820 --> 02:53:18,380
For losers like I've been, it's so hard to say.

2201
02:53:22,420 --> 02:53:23,740
Suddenly, Seymour...

2202
02:53:24,180 --> 02:53:27,320
he purified me.

2203
02:53:30,900 --> 02:53:32,660
Suddenly, Seymour...

2204
02:53:32,660 --> 02:53:37,660
showed me I can...

2205
02:53:38,460 --> 02:53:42,220
learn how to be a man.

2206
02:53:42,620 --> 02:53:46,340
The girl that's inside me.

2207
02:53:47,180 --> 02:53:48,840
What sweet understanding.

2208
02:53:49,040 --> 02:53:50,660
What sweet understanding.

2209
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:54,680
What sweet understanding.

2210
02:53:55,400 --> 02:53:56,800
What sweet understanding.

2211
02:54:00,580 --> 02:54:02,640
What sweet understanding.

2212
02:54:06,460 --> 02:54:07,580
Your man.

2213
02:54:19,820 --> 02:54:21,540
Sorry, I couldn't hold out that note.

2214
02:54:26,410 --> 02:54:28,110
I'm getting hungry, that's why.

2215
02:54:30,740 --> 02:54:31,780
Oh my gosh.

2216
02:54:32,640 --> 02:54:35,520
I watched this movie for the first time ever...

2217
02:54:35,520 --> 02:54:38,780
on Halloween, many, many years ago.

2218
02:54:39,460 --> 02:54:41,400
So, let's see if I remember it.

2219
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:43,500
I think I actually listened to...

2220
02:54:43,500 --> 02:54:44,900
Didn't Herb sing this recently?

2221
02:54:46,960 --> 02:54:47,520
Seymour.

2222
02:54:51,650 --> 02:54:52,550
Let's hear it.

2223
02:54:52,570 --> 02:54:52,910
Let's see.

2224
02:54:53,050 --> 02:54:53,550
Oh gosh.

2225
02:54:55,150 --> 02:54:57,130
Oh, it's like not a normal...

2226
02:54:58,350 --> 02:54:59,170
Oh gosh.

2227
02:54:59,850 --> 02:55:02,410
Blue singer, male, pink... wait, female singer, pink.

2228
02:55:02,570 --> 02:55:04,310
Oh gosh.

2229
02:55:07,810 --> 02:55:08,930
It's astounding.

2230
02:55:10,210 --> 02:55:12,050
Time is fleeting.

2231
02:55:14,730 --> 02:55:15,290
Madness...

2232
02:55:15,290 --> 02:55:17,470
takes its toll.

2233
02:55:17,880 --> 02:55:20,090
But listen closely.

2234
02:55:20,690 --> 02:55:22,730
Not for very much longer.

2235
02:55:24,110 --> 02:55:26,690
I've got to...

2236
02:55:26,690 --> 02:55:28,170
keep control.

2237
02:55:29,350 --> 02:55:31,290
I remember...

2238
02:55:32,230 --> 02:55:34,910
doing the time warp.

2239
02:55:35,430 --> 02:55:37,290
Drinking those...

2240
02:55:38,110 --> 02:55:39,290
moments when...

2241
02:55:40,310 --> 02:55:42,500
the blackness would hit me...

2242
02:55:42,500 --> 02:55:45,060
and the void would be calling.

2243
02:55:46,820 --> 02:55:50,340
Let's do the time warp again.

2244
02:55:52,360 --> 02:55:55,420
Let's do the time warp again.

2245
02:55:56,640 --> 02:55:58,340
It's just a jump to the left.

2246
02:55:59,900 --> 02:56:01,560
And then a step to the right.

2247
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:08,020
And you bring your knees in time.

2248
02:56:08,340 --> 02:56:09,360
But it's the pelvic

2249
02:56:13,030 --> 02:56:14,010
pain.

2250
02:56:15,170 --> 02:56:18,230
Let's do the time warp again.

2251
02:56:25,240 --> 02:56:27,140
It's so dreamy.

2252
02:56:27,620 --> 02:56:29,780
Oh fantasy, free me.

2253
02:56:30,700 --> 02:56:32,600
So you can't see me.

2254
02:56:33,260 --> 02:56:35,040
No, not at all.

2255
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:37,720
In another dimension.

2256
02:56:38,640 --> 02:56:40,520
With voyeuristic intention.

2257
02:56:41,940 --> 02:56:43,120
Well secluded.

2258
02:56:44,320 --> 02:56:46,080
I see all.

2259
02:56:47,080 --> 02:56:49,260
With a bit of a mind flip.

2260
02:56:49,920 --> 02:56:52,140
And nothing's a time flip.

2261
02:56:53,220 --> 02:56:57,000
And nothing can ever be the same.

2262
02:56:58,080 --> 02:56:59,940
You're spaced out of sensation.

2263
02:57:00,700 --> 02:57:02,920
Like you're under sedation.

2264
02:57:05,080 --> 02:57:07,900
Let's do the time warp again.

2265
02:57:15,340 --> 02:57:16,820
Well I was walking down the street.

2266
02:57:16,980 --> 02:57:18,040
Just I happened to think.

2267
02:57:18,160 --> 02:57:20,760
And a snake of a guy gave me an evil wink.

2268
02:57:20,980 --> 02:57:22,100
Well he shook me up.

2269
02:57:22,240 --> 02:57:23,600
He took me by surprise.

2270
02:57:23,720 --> 02:57:24,880
He had a pickup truck.

2271
02:57:27,890 --> 02:57:29,250
I felt a change.

2272
02:57:29,250 --> 02:57:30,230
Time nap.

2273
02:57:48,690 --> 02:57:50,090
With your hands on your hips.

2274
02:57:51,230 --> 02:57:53,630
You bring your knees in tight.

2275
02:57:56,730 --> 02:57:58,310
That really drives you insane.

2276
02:58:00,950 --> 02:58:03,050
Let's do the time warp.

2277
02:58:17,080 --> 02:58:19,480
I'm surprised at how much I remembered of that song.

2278
02:58:19,560 --> 02:58:20,340
Oh my gosh.

2279
02:58:21,680 --> 02:58:22,640
Time warp.

2280
02:58:23,460 --> 02:58:25,640
I guess it's like one of those kind of iconic songs.

2281
02:58:25,760 --> 02:58:26,840
It's hard to forget, right?

2282
02:58:27,280 --> 02:58:30,060
You hear it once and you're like this is such an iconic song.

2283
02:58:32,340 --> 02:58:33,600
I have three more songs.

2284
02:58:34,700 --> 02:58:36,920
Well, maybe I should save this one for last.

2285
02:58:37,120 --> 02:58:37,280
Okay.

2286
02:58:38,200 --> 02:58:40,520
Actually, some people were requesting Snake Eater.

2287
02:58:40,620 --> 02:58:43,080
But I don't know if I want to sing it today since I sang it yesterday.

2288
02:58:44,760 --> 02:58:47,060
I did another Metal Gear song earlier.

2289
02:58:47,960 --> 02:58:51,040
I mean I always want to sing Metal Gear, but I don't know.

2290
02:58:56,350 --> 02:58:57,930
Herb of Vengeance, that's happening.

2291
02:58:58,590 --> 02:58:59,350
Maybe now.

2292
02:59:01,130 --> 02:59:03,590
Hold on, I want to...

2293
02:59:04,510 --> 02:59:07,490
I want to practice again.

2294
02:59:09,770 --> 02:59:15,590
If the world was ending, I want to be next to you.

2295
02:59:16,510 --> 02:59:18,630
Save it for MGS Karaoke whenever that happens.

2296
02:59:19,050 --> 02:59:19,910
MGS Karaoke.

2297
02:59:23,260 --> 02:59:24,840
Okay, I'll save it.

2298
02:59:27,910 --> 02:59:31,970
If the world was ending...

2299
02:59:31,970 --> 02:59:33,610
It was my B-Day a couple days ago.

2300
02:59:33,830 --> 02:59:34,930
I sadly missed your stream.

2301
02:59:34,930 --> 02:59:37,270
Bon Burgo, happy birthday.

2302
02:59:37,390 --> 02:59:38,210
Happy belated birthday.

2303
02:59:39,010 --> 02:59:40,910
Happy birthday to you.

2304
02:59:41,230 --> 02:59:43,070
Happy birthday to you.

2305
02:59:43,430 --> 02:59:45,550
Happy birthday, Bon Burgo.

2306
02:59:45,910 --> 02:59:48,730
Happy birthday to you.

2307
02:59:52,820 --> 02:59:56,340
I have always so many people requesting Skyfall, but like...

2308
03:00:00,220 --> 03:00:01,440
Or Adele.

2309
03:00:05,780 --> 03:00:08,060
I don't think I'm really good at Adele songs.

2310
03:00:09,120 --> 03:00:10,280
I don't think.

2311
03:00:17,570 --> 03:00:20,070
I don't think my voice is really suited for it.

2312
03:00:20,630 --> 03:00:21,090
Is all.

2313
03:00:21,290 --> 03:00:22,550
That's why I never sing them.

2314
03:00:36,420 --> 03:00:37,460
Rent Glory?

2315
03:00:39,520 --> 03:00:40,560
Something Glory.

2316
03:00:42,380 --> 03:00:42,900
Glory.

2317
03:00:43,600 --> 03:00:44,140
Oh gosh.

2318
03:00:44,680 --> 03:00:46,120
Thank you for the pick.

2319
03:00:46,180 --> 03:00:47,860
I don't know, I don't think I can sing Glory.

2320
03:00:47,920 --> 03:00:49,140
I don't remember it so well.

2321
03:00:50,680 --> 03:00:51,720
Something Glory.

2322
03:00:53,520 --> 03:00:54,040
Glory.

2323
03:00:58,400 --> 03:00:58,720
Uh...

2324
03:00:59,160 --> 03:01:01,360
You did remind me of a song that I...

2325
03:01:01,360 --> 03:01:05,440
Not the Glory though, but I saw someone remind me of a song that I...

2326
03:01:05,440 --> 03:01:06,500
Think I want to sing.

2327
03:01:06,560 --> 03:01:07,460
It's a Japanese song.

2328
03:01:07,560 --> 03:01:09,440
Let me see if there's a karaoke of it on YouTube.

2329
03:01:15,250 --> 03:01:16,570
Oh my gosh, there is.

2330
03:01:18,990 --> 03:01:19,970
I guess I want to sing...

2331
03:01:19,970 --> 03:01:20,850
This one's for me, guys.

2332
03:01:20,910 --> 03:01:21,570
This one's for me.

2333
03:01:23,050 --> 03:01:24,570
This one's for me, this one's for me.

2334
03:01:25,650 --> 03:01:26,630
I really like this song.

2335
03:02:18,410 --> 03:02:18,550
I really like this song.

2336
03:02:37,790 --> 03:02:39,590
I love this song.

2337
03:02:40,150 --> 03:02:40,390
I love this song.

2338
03:02:40,390 --> 03:02:43,490
I heard it the other day on my mp3 player and I was like...

2339
03:02:43,490 --> 03:02:45,490
This song is so good.

2340
03:02:59,610 --> 03:03:12,310
I heard it the other day on my mp3 player and I was like...

2341
03:03:12,310 --> 03:03:28,970
Show us your Walkman, you hag!

2342
03:03:29,610 --> 03:03:30,690
It's in my car!

2343
03:03:35,770 --> 03:03:37,910
The pochi version is so good in this song.

2344
03:03:39,230 --> 03:03:39,670
I

2345
03:03:50,250 --> 03:03:54,990
have an older car, so I have to plug up my mp3 player to it, okay?

2346
03:04:25,600 --> 03:04:27,940
It's you, isn't it?

2347
03:05:28,330 --> 03:05:30,630
It's a little low for me, but...

2348
03:05:46,770 --> 03:05:48,290
This song is so good.

2349
03:05:48,630 --> 03:05:49,730
Asian Kung Fu generation.

2350
03:05:50,490 --> 03:05:52,090
Best thing that came from a race.

2351
03:05:55,430 --> 03:05:56,510
You said it, not me.

2352
03:05:59,910 --> 03:06:01,190
Okay, I have two songs left.

2353
03:06:01,430 --> 03:06:01,970
For real now.

2354
03:06:02,930 --> 03:06:03,770
Oh, let me do...

2355
03:06:03,770 --> 03:06:05,370
Let me do the one with Erb first.

2356
03:06:06,650 --> 03:06:08,410
Let me do the one with Erb first.

2357
03:06:09,570 --> 03:06:10,090
Hold on.

2358
03:06:10,210 --> 03:06:11,170
Oh, let me set her up.

2359
03:06:11,250 --> 03:06:11,630
Hold on.

2360
03:06:11,890 --> 03:06:13,210
You might hear her for a second.

2361
03:06:14,030 --> 03:06:14,770
Oh no, you don't?

2362
03:06:14,810 --> 03:06:15,290
Okay, cool.

2363
03:06:16,910 --> 03:06:18,150
Let me set her up.

2364
03:06:18,190 --> 03:06:19,010
Let me set her up.

2365
03:06:20,150 --> 03:06:21,050
Let me set her up.

2366
03:06:21,070 --> 03:06:22,170
Let me set her up.

2367
03:06:22,490 --> 03:06:23,230
No, no, no.

2368
03:06:23,250 --> 03:06:23,770
Not that.

2369
03:06:24,370 --> 03:06:24,730
This.

2370
03:06:25,210 --> 03:06:27,090
I have to make sure I can...

2371
03:06:29,610 --> 03:06:30,250
Hear her.

2372
03:06:30,710 --> 03:06:31,530
Wait, how do I...

2373
03:06:31,530 --> 03:06:32,130
Wait, hold on.

2374
03:06:35,390 --> 03:06:36,170
Wait, wait, wait.

2375
03:06:38,010 --> 03:06:38,710
Hi, Erb.

2376
03:06:40,870 --> 03:06:42,550
I wonder if I should just play the audio.

2377
03:06:44,290 --> 03:06:45,630
No, I want to see her face.

2378
03:06:49,500 --> 03:06:51,100
Okay, and now I need to be able to hear her.

2379
03:06:55,520 --> 03:06:56,180
There we go.

2380
03:06:57,520 --> 03:06:57,840
Okay.

2381
03:07:00,160 --> 03:07:00,900
Hello, queen.

2382
03:07:02,700 --> 03:07:03,060
Hello.

2383
03:07:04,740 --> 03:07:05,800
This is so...

2384
03:07:05,800 --> 03:07:07,240
This is why I was just like...

2385
03:07:07,240 --> 03:07:08,620
It's kind of awkward for me.

2386
03:07:08,760 --> 03:07:10,320
So this is why I'm like...

2387
03:07:10,320 --> 03:07:12,400
This is the only time I'll do it, okay?

2388
03:07:12,740 --> 03:07:14,320
This is the last time I'll do it.

2389
03:07:17,810 --> 03:07:18,170
Okay.

2390
03:07:21,280 --> 03:07:22,640
I don't want to mess it up.

2391
03:07:22,800 --> 03:07:24,800
If I mess it up, I get a third time, okay?

2392
03:07:26,540 --> 03:07:28,300
If I mess it up, I'll get a third time.

2393
03:07:28,340 --> 03:07:29,820
Okay, I just want to listen to her sing.

2394
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:32,160
Oh, here, I should make myself smaller.

2395
03:07:32,160 --> 03:07:34,400
Here, I'll just stand all the way in the back.

2396
03:07:37,870 --> 03:07:38,370
Okay.

2397
03:07:40,530 --> 03:07:41,370
Hi, everyone.

2398
03:07:41,470 --> 03:07:42,270
I'm looking at you.

2399
03:07:42,550 --> 03:07:43,210
Okay, cool.

2400
03:07:43,630 --> 03:07:44,050
Alright.

2401
03:07:45,250 --> 03:07:46,790
Oh, I need... Actually, sorry.

2402
03:07:46,890 --> 03:07:50,930
I just realized I need our lyrics split instead of just regular lyrics.

2403
03:07:51,590 --> 03:07:52,770
Not regular lyrics.

2404
03:07:52,930 --> 03:07:53,590
Lyrics split.

2405
03:07:53,770 --> 03:07:54,390
Lyrics split.

2406
03:08:04,270 --> 03:08:05,570
Okay, here we go.

2407
03:08:11,350 --> 03:08:11,390
Ooh

2408
03:08:17,270 --> 03:09:08,150
I, I just woke up from a dream Where you and I had to say goodbye And I don't know what it all means But since I survived, I realized Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow Nobody's promised tomorrow So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night Like it's the last night If the world was ending I'd want to be next to you If the party was over And our time on Earth was through Ooh,

2409
03:09:09,930 --> 03:09:14,110
I'd want to hold you just for a while.

2410
03:09:14,670 --> 03:09:18,590
And die with a smile.

2411
03:09:19,490 --> 03:09:25,710
If the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you.

2412
03:09:28,050 --> 03:09:28,990
Ooh.

2413
03:09:34,850 --> 03:09:39,470
Lost, lost in the words that we scream.

2414
03:09:40,470 --> 03:09:43,550
I don't even want to do this anymore.

2415
03:09:44,950 --> 03:09:48,390
Cause you already know what you mean to me.

2416
03:09:48,670 --> 03:09:53,710
And our love's the only war worth fighting for.

2417
03:09:54,110 --> 03:09:58,090
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow.

2418
03:09:59,350 --> 03:10:02,250
Nobody's promised tomorrow.

2419
03:10:03,330 --> 03:10:06,970
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night.

2420
03:10:06,970 --> 03:10:09,330
Like it's the last night.

2421
03:10:09,770 --> 03:10:15,970
If the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you.

2422
03:10:16,690 --> 03:10:16,830
Ooh.

2423
03:10:18,270 --> 03:10:25,190
If the party was over and our time on earth was through.

2424
03:10:25,730 --> 03:10:26,070
Ooh.

2425
03:10:27,470 --> 03:10:31,930
I'd want to hold you just for a while.

2426
03:10:32,510 --> 03:10:36,090
And die with a smile.

2427
03:10:36,730 --> 03:10:43,870
If the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you.

2428
03:10:44,750 --> 03:10:48,130
Right next to you.

2429
03:10:49,590 --> 03:10:52,650
Next to you.

2430
03:10:54,410 --> 03:10:58,090
Right next to you.

2431
03:10:58,910 --> 03:10:59,470
Mint,

2432
03:11:08,010 --> 03:11:09,450
mint, mint, mint, mint, mint.

2433
03:11:09,530 --> 03:11:11,850
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

2434
03:11:11,890 --> 03:11:14,030
Hearts in chat, hearts in chat, hearts in chat.

2435
03:11:14,930 --> 03:11:15,490
Yeah!

2436
03:11:17,110 --> 03:11:18,050
Let's go!

2437
03:11:18,190 --> 03:11:24,930
If the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you.

2438
03:11:25,130 --> 03:11:25,150
Ooh.

2439
03:11:26,590 --> 03:11:33,950
If the party was over and our time on earth was through.

2440
03:11:35,830 --> 03:11:40,630
I'd want to hold you just for a while.

2441
03:11:40,970 --> 03:11:44,490
And die with a smile.

2442
03:11:45,370 --> 03:11:51,470
If the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you.

2443
03:11:52,410 --> 03:11:53,330
Ooh.

2444
03:11:54,110 --> 03:12:00,790
If the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you.

2445
03:12:03,250 --> 03:12:03,730
Ooh.

2446
03:12:06,410 --> 03:12:10,090
I'd want to be next to you.

2447
03:12:15,050 --> 03:12:16,290
Oh my gosh.

2448
03:12:16,490 --> 03:12:17,090
Thank you.

2449
03:12:17,330 --> 03:12:21,410
Thank you so much for having me on your special day.

2450
03:12:21,650 --> 03:12:22,990
Thank you so much.

2451
03:12:22,990 --> 03:12:27,350
It means the world to me to sing with you.

2452
03:12:27,570 --> 03:12:29,070
I want to be next to you.

2453
03:12:30,350 --> 03:12:32,010
I want to be next to Maid Mint.

2454
03:12:32,250 --> 03:12:33,010
Thank you so much.

2455
03:12:33,070 --> 03:12:34,670
Have a great rest of your stream.

2456
03:12:35,150 --> 03:12:35,590
Yes!

2457
03:12:36,610 --> 03:12:37,530
Oh my gosh.

2458
03:12:37,750 --> 03:12:38,730
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2459
03:12:38,750 --> 03:12:39,210
Thank you!

2460
03:12:39,930 --> 03:12:40,610
Buh-bye!

2461
03:12:45,810 --> 03:12:45,970
Yay!

2462
03:12:52,690 --> 03:12:53,130
Yay!

2463
03:12:53,130 --> 03:12:54,550
Revenge happened!

2464
03:12:57,170 --> 03:12:58,630
I think that was better, baby.

2465
03:13:04,360 --> 03:13:05,180
Was it better?

2466
03:13:05,300 --> 03:13:05,880
Was it okay?

2467
03:13:06,040 --> 03:13:06,540
Oh my gosh.

2468
03:13:06,620 --> 03:13:07,940
She is just insane.

2469
03:13:08,380 --> 03:13:10,480
I hope she sings that song every karaoke.

2470
03:13:11,120 --> 03:13:12,880
But she needs to cover both voices.

2471
03:13:14,860 --> 03:13:17,380
I want to hear her do Lady Gaga's part too.

2472
03:13:23,020 --> 03:13:23,540
Yay!

2473
03:13:23,780 --> 03:13:24,740
Oh my gosh.

2474
03:13:26,220 --> 03:13:26,980
I'd die.

2475
03:13:27,080 --> 03:13:27,800
Thank you forever.

2476
03:13:32,010 --> 03:13:33,490
Okay, I have one last song.

2477
03:13:33,610 --> 03:13:35,590
It's another real...

2478
03:13:36,810 --> 03:13:37,730
What's the word?

2479
03:13:40,710 --> 03:13:42,270
Culture... No, not culture shock.

2480
03:13:43,350 --> 03:13:43,870
Whiplash!

2481
03:13:45,110 --> 03:13:46,030
Victor Song!

2482
03:13:46,230 --> 03:13:47,310
Thank you for the Aqua Super!

2483
03:13:47,310 --> 03:13:50,330
Thanks for two days of great singing.

2484
03:13:50,450 --> 03:13:51,970
I was having so much fun watching yesterday.

2485
03:13:52,050 --> 03:13:53,930
I forgot to pay for the parking at the gym.

2486
03:13:54,970 --> 03:13:56,930
Rather than pay for the parking company, here's the ticket.

2487
03:13:57,090 --> 03:13:57,710
Oh no!

2488
03:13:58,050 --> 03:13:58,590
The ticket!

2489
03:14:00,730 --> 03:14:01,130
No!

2490
03:14:01,890 --> 03:14:02,950
Oh my gosh.

2491
03:14:04,210 --> 03:14:04,610
Don't go.

2492
03:14:05,230 --> 03:14:07,050
Also, you standing on stage is incredibly cute.

2493
03:14:08,890 --> 03:14:11,350
I thought maybe I would have it...

2494
03:14:12,770 --> 03:14:17,330
I thought I would have it maybe closer today so you could see me more.

2495
03:14:19,670 --> 03:14:19,990
Okidoki.

2496
03:14:20,350 --> 03:14:22,750
I'm going to hold on to the mic for this one.

2497
03:14:24,050 --> 03:14:26,290
I'm going to hold on to the mic and I'm going to bring you guys in too.

2498
03:14:27,370 --> 03:14:27,690
Okidoki.

2499
03:14:28,530 --> 03:14:28,850
Okidoki!

2500
03:14:31,230 --> 03:14:31,870
Last song.

2501
03:14:41,100 --> 03:14:41,700
Turn it down.

2502
03:14:41,780 --> 03:14:42,080
Turn it down.

2503
03:14:42,140 --> 03:14:42,500
Oh my god.

2504
03:14:49,850 --> 03:14:51,030
I don't want to wake up.

2505
03:14:51,090 --> 03:14:52,130
Everything is fucked.

2506
03:14:52,270 --> 03:14:53,170
Everybody sucks.

2507
03:14:53,350 --> 03:14:57,850
You don't really know why, but you want to justify ripping someone's head off.

2508
03:14:57,910 --> 03:14:59,170
No human contact.

2509
03:14:59,410 --> 03:15:01,930
And if you interact, your life is on contract.

2510
03:15:02,170 --> 03:15:04,410
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!

2511
03:15:04,850 --> 03:15:06,350
It's just one of those days.

2512
03:15:06,750 --> 03:15:09,110
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit.

2513
03:15:10,950 --> 03:15:12,210
I think you better quit.

2514
03:15:12,470 --> 03:15:13,490
Let's slip straight.

2515
03:15:15,330 --> 03:15:17,910
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit.

2516
03:15:17,910 --> 03:15:20,890
I don't know why you guys always want me to sing this song so much.

2517
03:15:21,170 --> 03:15:22,110
Talking that shit.

2518
03:15:23,130 --> 03:15:25,670
It's just one of those days, feeling like a freight train.

2519
03:15:25,870 --> 03:15:28,330
First one to complain, leaves with a blood stain.

2520
03:15:28,570 --> 03:15:29,750
Damn right I'm a maniac.

2521
03:15:30,150 --> 03:15:32,610
You better watch your back, cause I'm fucking up the program.

2522
03:15:32,930 --> 03:15:35,430
If you're so stuck up, you just lucked up.

2523
03:15:35,610 --> 03:15:36,150
Next in line,

2524
03:15:39,250 --> 03:15:39,910
fuckers!

2525
03:15:39,970 --> 03:15:41,390
It's just one of those days.

2526
03:15:43,370 --> 03:15:44,190
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit.

2527
03:15:45,950 --> 03:15:47,250
I think you better quit.

2528
03:15:47,470 --> 03:15:48,470
Let's slip straight.

2529
03:15:48,470 --> 03:15:50,230
Or you'll be leaving with a fat lip.

2530
03:15:50,690 --> 03:15:52,990
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit.

2531
03:15:54,710 --> 03:15:56,050
I think you better quit.

2532
03:15:56,190 --> 03:15:57,130
Talking that shit.

2533
03:15:57,670 --> 03:15:58,930
So come and get it.

2534
03:16:00,450 --> 03:16:01,790
I feel like shit.

2535
03:16:01,990 --> 03:16:02,490
Not really.

2536
03:16:03,010 --> 03:16:05,830
My suggestion is to keep your distance.

2537
03:16:06,010 --> 03:16:07,630
Cause right now I'm dangerous.

2538
03:16:08,470 --> 03:16:10,470
We've all felt like shit.

2539
03:16:10,610 --> 03:16:12,250
And been treated like shit.

2540
03:16:12,530 --> 03:16:15,790
All those motherfuckers that wanna step up.

2541
03:16:15,790 --> 03:16:18,170
I hope you know I pack a chainsaw.

2542
03:16:18,910 --> 03:16:20,350
I rip your ass raw.

2543
03:16:21,410 --> 03:16:23,230
And if my day keeps going this way.

2544
03:16:23,310 --> 03:16:25,450
I just might break something tonight.

2545
03:16:25,810 --> 03:16:27,230

2546
03:16:27,770 --> 03:16:29,330
I skin your ass raw.

2547
03:16:30,310 --> 03:16:32,210
And if my day keeps going this way.

2548
03:16:32,330 --> 03:16:34,370
I just might break something tonight.

2549
03:16:34,830 --> 03:16:36,450
I pack a chainsaw.

2550
03:16:36,770 --> 03:16:38,270
I skin your ass raw.

2551
03:16:39,090 --> 03:16:40,930
And if my day keeps going this way.

2552
03:16:41,050 --> 03:16:43,750
I just might break your fucking face tonight.

2553
