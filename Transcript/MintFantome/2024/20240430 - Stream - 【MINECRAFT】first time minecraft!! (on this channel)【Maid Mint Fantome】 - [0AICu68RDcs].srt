00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,080
Can you guys hear me through this?

3
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,540
Uh-oh, I think all my audio is messed up.

4
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,300
Hold on.

5
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,340
What's going on?

6
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,800
Output is on.

7
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,420
You can, okay.

8
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,640
Hold on, give me a second.

9
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,760
I don't know why, it might be double once I fix this.

10
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,280
Oh, hold on, let me check this.

11
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,680
Streaming...

12
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,720
Streaming...

13
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,530
Pretty, thank you for the 50 gifted, thank you!

14
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,630
What the heck?

15
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,070
It was just working!

16
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,390
Oh, wait, you can hear this, wait.

17
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,450
I'm so confused.

18
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,690
I'm so confused.

19
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,110
We got the music.

20
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,770
Hold on, let's see if we can hear the game.

21
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,440
I think you can.

22
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:22,820
Yippee!

23
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,280
Hold on.

24
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,820
It's a little loud, right?

25
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,340
Seven?

26
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,540
Sixty?

27
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,780
Actually, I don't know if that changed anything.

28
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:37,860
Okay.

29
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,800
I'm so...

30
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,940
The audio is low for me all around.

31
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,020
Yeah, but because...

32
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,000
Because it was lowered, because I had to turn on a different setting.

33
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,340
I'm so confused.

34
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,700
I guess I'll just use this then.

35
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,620
Wait, hold on, let me check if it works.

36
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,200
Hmm...

37
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,740
Weird!

38
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,820
Much better?

39
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,780
Sorry if that was a jump scare.

40
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,060
Sorry if that was a jump scare.

41
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,400
Um...

42
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,120
Okay.

43
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,640
Now I feel really weird.

44
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,360
Now I feel all discombobulated.

45
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,840
Perfect volume?

46
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,280
We're good?

47
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,720
Okay.

48
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,740
I sound cleaner?

49
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,210
I don't know.

50
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,410
If I should sound cleaner...

51
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,470
It's all the same.

52
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,330
Whatever.

53
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,190
Bread is pain.

54
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,930
So true, Minecraft.

55
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,490
Anyway...

56
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,650
Welcome back!

57
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:03,990
Master!

58
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:04,970
Lady!

59
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,490
Welcome!

60
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:06,670
Welcome!

61
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:10,890
Welcome...

62
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,810
Welcome...

63
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,250
To...

64
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,570
Minecraft!

65
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,310
I, um...

66
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,410
I truly have no plans.

67
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,530
Um...

68
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,530
I have no plans.

69
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,650
I'm just kind of...

70
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,630
Thanks for the thank you!

71
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:34,210
Thank you!

72
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,270
I just felt like playing.

73
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,230
So, I'm Mirai.

74
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:39,890
Welcome to the membership.

75
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,610
Thank you!

76
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,250
What is this new game?

77
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,550
I know!

78
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,850
My gosh!

79
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,830
Yeah, we're gonna punch trees.

80
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,690
As you can see, I have no servers.

81
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,130
So, um...

82
00:07:59,190 --> 00:07:59,770
So...

83
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,050
It's just gonna be you and me, baby.

84
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,550
It's gonna be just us.

85
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,190
It's gonna be single player mode.

86
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,130
All on our own.

87
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,950
We're gonna be...

88
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,830
We're gonna be fighting for our lives.

89
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,850
You and me together.

90
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,750
Solo venture.

91
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:22,430
Yeah.

92
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,850
A date?

93
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,120
Not a date.

94
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,760
Don't say it like that.

95
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,980
That's weird.

96
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,720
A date with me and...

97
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,400
A date with me and...

98
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,940
However many people are in here.

99
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:37,980
Don't say it.

100
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,620
It makes me anxious.

101
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,340
Someone is third wheeling though.

102
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,060
One of you guys...

103
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,380
One of you guys is third wheeling.

104
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,560
So...

105
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,620
I have my new cat in here with me.

106
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,080
So...

107
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,480
At some point, she might want to be let out.

108
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,120
I don't know.

109
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,060
She's kind of doing her own thing.

110
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,280
I'm...

111
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,360
I'm watching over her because she did not have a very good morning.

112
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,440
And I was so worried about her.

113
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
I thought I would be having to take her to the vet.

114
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,820
But I think she's okay now.

115
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,740
That's the new cat called Adamska.

116
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,400
Me like being third wheel pain.

117
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,720
Bread is pain.

118
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,400
Bread is pain.

119
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:34,920
She doesn't have a name yet.

120
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,500
She dies.

121
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,800
She dies.

122
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,520
Hi kitty.

123
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,060
She's... I don't know.

124
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,880
She's behind...

125
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,700
I think she's laying in the bed over there.

126
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,340
So...

127
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,500
Finally got mine grabbed.

128
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,360
Yeah.

129
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,620
Thank you guys for the super dots.

130
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,680
Thank you.

131
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,880
Is it MGS related?

132
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,160
What?

133
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,260
Why?

134
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,740
Why would it be...

135
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,700
Why would it be ...

136
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,520
MGS related?

137
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,300
Why...?

138
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,520
Why would it be...

139
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,300
Why would it be MGS related?

140
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,380
Motherfuckin'...

141
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,940
Minecraft lights...

142
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,280
Go.

143
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,920
Sakha, thank you for the pink.

144
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,600
First time, huh.

145
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,980
Playing Minecraft?

146
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,020
Oh, okay.

147
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,020
You guys, it's a bit of a fib, okay?

148
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,160
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:50,440
This isn't my first time playing Minecraft on this channel because a couple years ago, Lyrica, Nova, and I, we all did a haunted Minecraft mod map on my channel.

150
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,280
So it's a bit of a lie.

151
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,740
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,480
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,100
Hold on.

154
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,700
I'm bowing.

155
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,280
I'm so sorry.

156
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,260
Lying is bad.

157
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,500
It's clickbait.

158
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,960
It was clickbait.

159
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,820
I'm so sorry.

160
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,840
I'm so sorry.

161
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,620
Wait, Tuber, why you lie?

162
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,900
But this is the real time playing just regular Minecraft.

163
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,720
Yeah, I clickbaited because I'm sorry.

164
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,640
I'm a real YouTuber.

165
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:32,920
Let's see.

166
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,400
I'm excited to see what our world is going to be.

167
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,420
What should we call it?

168
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,360
That's the first thing we got to do.

169
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,900
What do we call the world?

170
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,780
Also, should I do like hardcore?

171
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,100
Wait, this is hard.

172
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,440
No.

173
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,700
Oh, wait, it would be hardcore.

174
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:50,840
Hardcore.

175
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,680
Outer Heaven.

176
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,620
Bustin' World.

177
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,880
Made World.

178
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,800
Phantom Zone.

179
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,300
Made World.

180
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,200
Outer Heaven.

181
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
Bustin' Zone.

182
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,960
Oh, Bustin' Z!

183
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:18,240
See you on the next episode of Made World Outer Heaven Bustin' Z!

184
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,740
Perfect.

185
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,660
Good job, guys.

186
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,080
Oh my gosh.

187
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,440
Whoa.

188
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,620
I wonder what kind of... where we're going to start.

189
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,980
I hope it's somewhere good.

190
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,600
Cows!

191
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,250
You guys are in Minecraft.

192
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,110
Hopefully, there's no lag.

193
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,070
How's the audio, by the way?

194
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:50,850
Just let me know.

195
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,570
I can change anything you want.

196
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,070
We're in a jungle.

197
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:58,970
Go punch a tree.

198
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,050
Oh, here we go.

199
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:03,590
Here we go.

200
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,090
Here we go.

201
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:04,470
Here we go.

202
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,710
Wait, where's my...

203
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,410
Oh, okay.

204
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,290
I need four of these.

205
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:24,700
Okay.

206
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:27,900
Crafting...

207
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:29,960
Oh.

208
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,880
Crafting table!

209
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,580
I want it to be neater, though.

210
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:39,450
Complete.

211
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,010
The two by two.

212
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,450
Crafting table.

213
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,550
Okay.

214
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,590
Let's go explore the land a little bit.

215
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,590
Oh my gosh.

216
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,610
Okay, I can... Oh, yes.

217
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,830
Check me out.

218
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:00,690
Yippee!

219
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:02,830
I'm beautiful.

220
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:03,450
Oh.

221
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,810
I'm next to this cow.

222
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,110
Oh, oh, hold on.

223
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,590
I don't want to fall into a hole and, like, die immediately, but...

224
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,430
Oh my god.

225
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,190
Wait.

226
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,970
I... Oh, this is the water.

227
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,990
I was gonna say I could have fallen into a hole and died immediately.

228
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,190
Who's that creeper?

229
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,730
Oh, man.

230
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,170
Um...

231
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,210
So, uh...

232
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,470
Yesterday, I was supposed to stream...

233
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:29,570
Oh!

234
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,490
I just realized my eyes.

235
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,090
So...

236
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,390
I'm always so excited when I'm running around.

237
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:37,870
Sorry.

238
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,150
But I have to open my eyes to be able to play the game, you know?

239
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,150
She's a professional.

240
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,490
She learns so fast.

241
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,890
So pro.

242
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,570
I can't help that I'm just a gamer.

243
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,750
I adapt, you know?

244
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,430
Being a gamer is all about adapting quickly.

245
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,720
I don't want to go down there just yet.

246
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,160
We have nothing.

247
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:04,760
Am I playing?

248
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,440
Oh, I'm in pla...

249
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,800
I'm playing in hardcore mode.

250
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,580
Oh my gosh.

251
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:07,920
I forgot.

252
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:08,800
Okay.

253
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,000
Wait.

254
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,760
We actually need to get some stuff then, don't we?

255
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,500
We actually need to get some stuff.

256
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,520
Like this little flower.

257
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,240
Today, I do want to build a little maid cafe.

258
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,940
I want to do that.

259
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:27,580
So...

260
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,240
This game seems interesting.

261
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,160
Hope it gets popular.

262
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,840
It's just like a little kind of indie, right?

263
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,100
I think.

264
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,680
It's a little indie.

265
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,120
Probably like a school project or something.

266
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,840
Hardcore maids.

267
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,260
Speaking of maids.

268
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,380
Yesterday, I finished Akiba Maid Wars.

269
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,980
I finished the show last night.

270
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,340
And...

271
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,840
Wow.

272
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,600
That was...

273
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,700
Oh.

274
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,380
I forgot to finish my sentence from before.

275
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:02,880
But...

276
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,860
How was it?

277
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,660
Let me finish what I was saying before and then we'll talk about it.

278
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,120
It was...

279
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,400
I forgot...

280
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:13,720
Or not.

281
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,020
I forgot.

282
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,400
I did not stream yesterday.

283
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,780
So, I'm streaming today on a Monday.

284
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,300
If you're watching the VOD...

285
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,780
Hello.

286
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,220
Thank you.

287
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,840
It might not be Monday for you.

288
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,060
But...

289
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,160
So, I wanted to make a video.

290
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,540
I wanted to make up for it with at least streaming today.

291
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,560
A little bit.

292
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,020
And...

293
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,700
I just got...

294
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:37,780
No.

295
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,740
I just got Minecraft yesterday.

296
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,460
So, hopefully...

297
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,320
You guys can backseat a little bit for me if it's okay.

298
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,480
Tuesday here.

299
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,320
It's Tuesday.

300
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,540
I'm dying.

301
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,040
Oh, God.

302
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,880
Maybe you guys should tell me that I should not drown.

303
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,180
Oh, my gosh.

304
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,780
It's April 29th.

305
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,540
Colonel.

306
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,580
We managed to avoid drowning.

307
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,480
Real.

308
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,680
Oxygen is important.

309
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,040
Okay.

310
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,380
Let's make ourselves a...

311
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,140
The real crafting table.

312
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,740
I should eat.

313
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,700
Are there any birds around here?

314
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,180
But...

315
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,240
Yeah.

316
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,500
So, I wanted to make up for it.

317
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,220
I don't...

318
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:41,620
Do not have a schedule this week that I'm writing out because my week is kind of like a little bit weird.

319
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,600
So...

320
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,620
I will...

321
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,280
Is that a Skeleman?

322
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,620
In the day?

323
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,580
You're not welcome here.

324
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,960
So...

325
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,060
I apologize.

326
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,200
But I will be putting up waiting rooms for streams that I have.

327
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,760
That I have confirmed for this week.

328
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:12,920
Such as I have a Metal Gear stream up for tomorrow, April 30th.

329
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,000
It's totally radical and cool.

330
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,200
Rude.

331
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,540
He's just minding his business.

332
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,160
I'm not.

333
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,180
I'm not.

334
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,300
This is my business.

335
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,560
This is my...

336
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,900
I've colonized this place.

337
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,780
It's mine.

338
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,300
I'm the ruler here now.

339
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,280
But yeah.

340
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,500
So radical and cool.

341
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,920
It's so awesome.

342
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,920
Another thing...

343
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,180
Uh oh.

344
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,280
We're hungry, you guys.

345
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:45,740
Uh oh.

346
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,760
Uh oh.

347
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:46,900
Uh oh.

348
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,040
Uh oh.

349
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,260
Uh oh.

350
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,160
Uh oh.

351
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:48,480
Uh oh.

352
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:48,600
Uh oh.

353
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,160
Uh oh.

354
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:49,900
Uh oh.

355
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,300
This is...

356
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,260
Friday I have a collab.

357
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,280
If you watch the Helldiver stream...

358
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,020
Oh!

359
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,200
A bird I can eat!

360
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,000
Wait.

361
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,220
No.

362
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,320
This is not a bird I can eat.

363
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:07,980
Sorry.

364
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,300
Oh.

365
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:12,980
Okay.

366
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,500
Let's eat some cows.

367
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,180
Okay.

368
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:19,880
Okay.

369
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,460
Where?

370
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,780
Skelly and spider?

371
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,260
Bo?

372
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,380
Bozo?

373
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,140
Wait.

374
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:27,460
Where?

375
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,200
Why are they so close?

376
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,880
Why are they so loud?

377
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,700
Okay.

378
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,780
Please die.

379
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,740
Please die.

380
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,080
Please.

381
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,320
Please die.

382
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:55,880
Okay, gosh.

383
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,120
Awesome.

384
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,280
It's just the Aurora Borealis.

385
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,140
What should the next world's name be?

386
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,360
Don't say that!

387
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,080
Don't say that!

388
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,980
Look, I'm punching pigs now, okay?

389
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,800
I'm punching pigs!

390
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,900
Doesn't this music really relax you?

391
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,200
During all of this.

392
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,140
Are they right there?

393
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:24,940
Oh, shoot!

394
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,580
Run, run, run, run, run, run!

395
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,120
Okay, I saw...

396
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,520
Ouch!

397
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,020
Okay.

398
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,740
We're fine.

399
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,620
He's not gonna come out.

400
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,300
He's an idiot.

401
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,240
Can't even stand the sunlight.

402
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:45,960
Okay.

403
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,400
Let's punch some more trees.

404
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:53,830
But yeah.

405
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:55,690
So...

406
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:01,630
I'll be doing a collab with Matara Henya...

407
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,770
Hold on, let me actually...

408
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,790
We confirmed this, right?

409
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:08,670
Yes!

410
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,690
Matara, Henya, and Haruka on Friday for Left 4 Dead 2!

411
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,110
So...

412
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,270
Don't vomit this time.

413
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,270
No guarantees this time.

414
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,650
So I'm excited for that.

415
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,310
That will be Friday.

416
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,670
8 p.m.

417
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,150
EST.

418
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,670
Oh, you guys are starting to get dark.

419
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,390
But yeah, I wanted to just mention that about the...

420
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,890
What is this?

421
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,630
Are these guys okay?

422
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,990
I've never seen the wolves of this color before.

423
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,810
New wolf types?

424
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,110
They added new wolves?

425
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,230
What?

426
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:04,770
Really?

427
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,950
There are different colored wolves now.

428
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,410
Regional wolves!

429
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,150
No way.

430
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:12,930
You guys are lying.

431
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,010
What?

432
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,730
There's wolf armor too?

433
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,250
Oh, they're so cute.

434
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,170
They look like dogs.

435
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,750
It's my first time seeing them ever.

436
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,090
It's my first time seeing them ever.

437
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:27,770
It's my first time seeing them ever.

438
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:29,870
Oh gosh.

439
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,850
Another one?

440
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,770
Why are there skeletons?

441
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:32,490
Get him.

442
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:38,460
I think we should build a boat.

443
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,780
And leave this place.

444
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,200
Leave this world behind.

445
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,180
We need bones.

446
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,140
We don't need bones.

447
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,900
Oh, I also have the bamboo wood.

448
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,020
How do I make that?

449
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,640
Bamboo wood.

450
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,240
Block of bamboo.

451
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,020
Oh no!

452
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,240
I can only make one.

453
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,380
Okay.

454
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,640
Boat.

455
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,220
I think I want to find...

456
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,780
I want to find...

457
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,020
Cherry blossoms.

458
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,720
It's starting to get really dark.

459
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,660
Goodbye, world!

460
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:23,960
Let's go.

461
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,080
Nothing can hurt you on the boat at night.

462
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,740
See, this is the most relaxing.

463
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,140
I'll be honest.

464
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,820
This is actually music that I listen to almost every night.

465
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,860
When I'm cleaning or winding down or anything.

466
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,180
You can't get me.

467
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,960
You can't hurt me.

468
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,280
Fool!

469
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,640
This is what I'm listening to at home.

470
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,220
Yeah.

471
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:51,980
So.

472
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,720
Akiba Maid War.

473
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,740
What is this?

474
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,560
Oh my gosh!

475
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,020
A coral!

476
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,080
Um.

477
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:00,800
I...

478
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,500
I actually really quite liked Akiba Maid War, but the ending...

479
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,960
was so...

480
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,400
Wow!

481
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,180
The ending was...

482
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,980
Very sudden, yes!

483
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,100
It was very, very sudden.

484
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,680
I'm just gonna steal...

485
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:24,940
Oh.

486
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,420
Oh.

487
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,240
Can I...

488
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,180
Do I have time to steal this?

489
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,200
I think so.

490
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,120
Okay.

491
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,480
Let's go.

492
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,900
See ya, suckers!

493
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,980
Now I have light.

494
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,840
The ending was...

495
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,020
It was, yeah.

496
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,300
Um.

497
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,100
There's always time for theft.

498
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,140
True.

499
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,860
Where are we going?

500
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,500
I wonder.

501
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,000
What will we find in this world?

502
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,480
This spectacular Minecraft world.

503
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,820
This looks lit up over here.

504
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,280
What is it?

505
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,940
Oh, I think it's just...

506
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,560
More...

507
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:11,820
Coral.

508
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,760
Leave that guy alone over there.

509
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,980
I was just listening to talk about the Russian maid on the podcast.

510
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,440
Yeah!

511
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,580
Oh yeah, the podcast came out today.

512
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,540
If you guys didn't listen, please do.

513
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,820
We are silly, goofy gals.

514
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,360
It certainly ended.

515
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,500
I did not watch the show.

516
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,340
It's like...

517
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,600
I don't want to say a bittersweet end.

518
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,460
But it is kind of bittersweet.

519
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,640
I actually didn't hate it.

520
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,420
At first I was like super shocked.

521
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,620
Sorry, I'm trying not to spoil anything in case anyone's like...

522
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,220
Um, Mint?

523
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,940
I was going to watch Akiba Maid War right after this.

524
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,260
I'm trying not to spoil, but...

525
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,520
It was good.

526
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,940
I'm excited to make my summer list.

527
00:25:59,360 --> 00:25:59,880
Yeah!

528
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,040
He's got armor on.

529
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,260
I need that.

530
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,420
Wait!

531
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,500
This is a mesa biome!

532
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:13,900
Wait!

533
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,360
That's mesa biome!

534
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,040
I thought it was a village.

535
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,620
Um...

536
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,020
Hmm...

537
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,740
I think we could just run through this.

538
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,480
Steal the armor.

539
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,250
Hmm...

540
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:34,790
Let's...

541
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,090
Let's carry on through.

542
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,010
Do you like the jazz?

543
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:39,830
Bozo Ranger?

544
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,230
I don't think there's any saxophone.

545
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,150
This is relaxing.

546
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,150
Just Minecraft sounds and jazz.

547
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,850
I really needed to wind down today.

548
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:55,830
Because...

549
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,170
To give you guys an idea, so I got my cat recently.

550
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,450
And she's so sweet and so cute.

551
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,230
Do we need a bucket for the list?

552
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:07,690
Preferably.

553
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:08,790
Preferably.

554
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,450
Preferably.

555
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,110
When I got my cat...

556
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,330
It's been a...

557
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,370
It's been like a little over a week.

558
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,590
And um...

559
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,470
Uh...

560
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,950
She's kind of bad.

561
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:26,110
In that she will get on...

562
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,710
I'm training her not to get on the counter.

563
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,430
But she currently likes to get on the counter.

564
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,410
And uh...

565
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,450
You know...

566
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:35,590
Um...

567
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,350
Get into things a little bit.

568
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,950
But um...

569
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,570
Hey, hey, don't pay attention to me.

570
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,710
Maybe if I go around this side.

571
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,970
I'm trying to get to the other side.

572
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,730
Oh my god, run.

573
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,350
And um...

574
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,060
But she got into the counter last night.

575
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,980
Or she got on the counter and got into some stuff last night.

576
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,060
Um...

577
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,380
I forgot to put away Butaro's food.

578
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,480
And she ate it.

579
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,300
And I don't think she had a good reaction to it.

580
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,720
And um...

581
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,080
She was like...

582
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,940
She threw up the most amount that I've ever seen a cat throw up.

583
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,700
First of all.

584
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,120
Which was very shocking.

585
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,580
I was like, whoa.

586
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,240
I didn't even know you had that in you.

587
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,040
Um...

588
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,800
Uh oh, I'm trapped.

589
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,620
But she also was like just getting poop everywhere.

590
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,600
Diarrhea.

591
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,660
And um...

592
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,660
And uh...

593
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,740
There was like poop in her...

594
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,360
Not poop.

595
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,200
There was blood.

596
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,220
There was blood in her poop.

597
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,000
It was just a mess.

598
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,900
I was like calling the emergency vet.

599
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,000
I was like...

600
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,420
What do I do?

601
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,520
And um...

602
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,460
Yeah, so...

603
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,640
I had a bit of a morning cleaning up all that.

604
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,960
Dealing with all of that.

605
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,960
So I was like...

606
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,980
I'm just gonna...

607
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,400
I'm just gonna take it easy.

608
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,320
And you know what?

609
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,440
Minecraft is a bit of a comfort game for me.

610
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,580
Sounds like my weekend.

611
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,420
For you?

612
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,540
Out your butt?

613
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,920
But um...

614
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,200
I think she's better now.

615
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,120
What did I walk into?

616
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,040
Just my crazy afterlife.

617
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,160
But that's why she's hanging out with me.

618
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,240
But that's why she's hanging out with me.

619
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,400
Eek!

620
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,160
That's why she's hanging out with me.

621
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,440
In here.

622
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,640
We're just, you know...

623
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,320
Yeah.

624
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,900
That happened to my new kitten.

625
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,440
Turns out she was having issues with chicken.

626
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,680
Switched to no poultry diet.

627
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,500
I think that's it!

628
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,840
I think that's it because I feed Butaro chicken.

629
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,580
But I've been feeding her beef.

630
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,000
But I've been feeding her beef.

631
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,960
And then she ate the chicken and then she went crazy.

632
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,020
Isn't that right?

633
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,220
Isn't that right little girl?

634
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,300
You're so sweet.

635
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,580
She's so sweet though.

636
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,420
Beef.

637
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,000
I smell like beef.

638
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,320
I smell like beef.

639
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,100
I smell like beef.

640
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,320
Wow.

641
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,040
The open sea is under the moonlight.

642
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:23,940
The open sea is under the moonlight.

643
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,040
What's over here?

644
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,260
Could it be another jungle?

645
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,560
Could it be a swamp?

646
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,700
The world...

647
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,760
Something like that.

648
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,320
Something like that.

649
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
Uh-oh.

650
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,700
Oh guys!

651
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,160
We're in trouble.

652
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,740
Oh we're in trouble.

653
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,020
No we're not.

654
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,560
Nah we're fine.

655
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,020
Nah we're fine.

656
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,520
But what's her name?

657
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,480
But what's her name?

658
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,240
Her name is...

659
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,340
Her name is... Drumroll, please.

660
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,480
Her name is Drumroll, please.

661
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,660
That's her name, actually.

662
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,840
So every time I can talk about her... That was not me, by the way.

663
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,000
Every time I talk about her, I can say, Drumroll, please!

664
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:26,120
She's the most well-experienced entrance cat ever.

665
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,000
To ever have an entrance.

666
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,580
Miss Drumroll, please.

667
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,160
Drumroll, please is such a cute name.

668
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,800
Thank you, I thought so too.

669
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,570
Actually, okay, I'll tell you for real.

670
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:55,030
Her name is... Drumroll, please.

671
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,810
Drumroll, please.

672
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,810
Drumroll, please.

673
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,030
Drumroll, please.

674
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:18,850
Drumroll, please.

675
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:19,730
Drumroll, please.

676
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:20,970
Drumroll, please.

677
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,310
Drumroll, please.

678
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:21,670
Drumroll, please.

679
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:21,850
Drumroll, please.

680
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,030
Drumroll, please.

681
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:22,190
Drumroll, please.

682
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:23,990
Drumroll, please.

683
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:24,070
Drumroll, please.

684
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,230
Drumroll, please.

685
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,670
Drumroll, please.

686
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,210
Drumroll, please.

687
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:25,970
Drumroll, please.

688
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,150
Drumroll, please.

689
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,490
Drumroll, please.

690
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,130
Drumroll, please.

691
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,330
Perfect.

692
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,950
Beef is back on the menu.

693
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,510
I don't know why I'm so embarrassed telling you her name.

694
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,130
It's not even that embarrassing.

695
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,050
Oh wait, I should save this.

696
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,450
Okay, I'm gonna death by flower.

697
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,730
Come on, stand still.

698
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,590
What?

699
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,990
What is wrong with you?

700
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,270
There we go.

701
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,210
Perfect.

702
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,070
I should really...

703
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,850
I should really make a sword.

704
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,090
Okay.

705
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,290
Drumroll please!

706
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,670
Her name is Paz!

707
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,830
Get it?

708
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,370
Cause it's like...

709
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,790
Cat Paz, but it's Paz.

710
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,770
Isn't it cute?

711
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:39,210
Actually?

712
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:39,690
Right?

713
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,730
Actually cute.

714
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,750
Actually her name is Pacifica Ocean, but you know.

715
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:54,710
Sword.

716
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,070
I thought about...

717
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,330
What's the word?

718
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:58,890
Speedrunning stuff.

719
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:00,910
Attempting to speedrun.

720
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,170
For today's stream.

721
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,730
But I don't know.

722
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,310
I thought maybe you guys weren't ready for that kind of challenge.

723
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,050
That is Kojima level naming convention.

724
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:22,970
I don't know if she wants peace though.

725
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,350
So, it's even truly more fitting.

726
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,230
It's a little too intense for us.

727
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,850
Paz is also peace in Spanish.

728
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:37,330
Yeah!

729
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,970
That's why Paz is Paz in Metal Gear.

730
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,370
I'm sorry.

731
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,170
I gave my cat a Metal Gear name.

732
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,670
But you have to understand.

733
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:47,810
It's...

734
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,870
You have to understand who you're dealing with right now.

735
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,190
Is it Paz?

736
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,690
Like P-A-W-Z?

737
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,890
Or Paz?

738
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:56,470
P-A-Z.

739
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,270
It's just P-A-Z.

740
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,030
P-A-Z.

741
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,330
P-A-Z.

742
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:08,610
Whoa!

743
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:09,370
That's water?

744
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:10,830
Whoa!

745
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,730
It looks so awesome.

746
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,550
The reflection of it.

747
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:19,570
If you're wondering, I'm using complementary shaders.

748
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:20,770
If you're wondering, I'm using complementary shaders.

749
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:24,750
Wait, so will we see other wolves as well?

750
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,050
Here?

751
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,210
Game looks nice.

752
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,670
It's the complementary...

753
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:39,710
Com...

754
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,850
Complementary...

755
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:43,630
Hum...

756
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:45,670
Something...

757
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,050
There's like a little tagline after it.

758
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:52,670
I don't remember.

759
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:54,770
Shaders.

760
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,650
No, more than shaders.

761
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,110
It was like...

762
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,090
Reloaded...

763
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,570
Matrix Revolution loaded.

764
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,910
Watching you play Minecraft, it just feels so right.

765
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,470
Words can't express the feeling of comfort I have right now.

766
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,490
Even though I've never played it.

767
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:17,870
On this channel.

768
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:23,830
That's good though.

769
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,550
Feel comfort.

770
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,770
Wait, maybe we can get some...

771
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,210
What's it called in here?

772
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,910
I need some...

773
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,910
We need some...

774
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:36,930
Stone.

775
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,310
But we also need...

776
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:44,870
Some coal.

777
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,150
Played it once.

778
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,450
You're so right.

779
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,270
Sorry.

780
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,090
Can't even remember my own lore.

781
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,270
I used streamer.

782
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:57,690
Used to watch.

783
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,090
Also used complementary stream...

784
00:36:59,090 --> 00:36:59,710
Shaders.

785
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,150
I looked through the Minecraft setting for such a long time before I realized...

786
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,070
That didn't mean the shaders were...

787
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,390
Called complementary.

788
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,370
Wait, what do you mean?

789
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:12,890
If you google complementary shaders Minecraft, I'm pretty sure you'll get these, right?

790
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,110
Are you ever gonna play with mods?

791
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:18,630
Yes!

792
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:19,890
I would like to.

793
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,230
I just...

794
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,830
Didn't set it up this time.

795
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,110
We're like super bare bones today.

796
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,390
But...

797
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:30,350
In the future, there will be mods.

798
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,630
And stuff of the like.

799
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,310
Yes, yes.

800
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:36,430
I went to May Dreaming for the first time and second time recently.

801
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,150
It was amazing.

802
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,870
I can't wait to come back when I go to Japan again.

803
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,390
Oh my gosh, generic user!

804
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,410
Glad you liked it.

805
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,470
Maybe we can find a village and pillage their food.

806
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,850
Maybe we can find a village and pillage their food.

807
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:51,870
For some coal, everybody.

808
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,810
Use your little wispy eyes.

809
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,970
I used my eyes!

810
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,710
Oh my gosh, I can't believe I saw that!

811
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:02,850
Escape route.

812
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,190
No one here?

813
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,430
Good deal.

814
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,170
Yeah!

815
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,340
You guys were no help.

816
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,520
More.

817
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:19,640
More.

818
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,420
More.

819
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:32,690
We tried.

820
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:40,230
I thought about putting on a playlist of Minecraft music.

821
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:41,550
Instead.

822
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:46,470
But I don't know why some of the Minecraft music comes off very unsettling.

823
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,210
Some of it's just like kinda weird.

824
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:49,530
You know?

825
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,270
Some of it's like a little bit creepy.

826
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,110
Self help is the best help.

827
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,590
Hi Amori!

828
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,030
Let's skedaddle.

829
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:05,490
Skedaddle.

830
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,630
I said get out of here and skedaddle.

831
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:08,450
Let's skedaddle.

832
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:11,110
Let's skedaddle out of here.

833
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,250
Let's skedaddle.

834
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,510
Now we can cook our meats.

835
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,230
Backed.

836
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,030
Looking for a village, but I don't see one.

837
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:25,870
Skedaddle.

838
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:28,450
Hmm.

839
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,050
I want to find...

840
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,190
Cherry Blossoms.

841
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,450
That's where I will settle.

842
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:41,030
I used to do Minecraft plus Animal Crossing music.

843
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,870
That sounds like a good combo too.

844
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,250
Minecraft is a horror game hiding behind adventure.

845
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:49,650
Yeah.

846
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,170
I guess that's why, right?

847
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,730
The music is a little weird.

848
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:55,870
Hey Minty.

849
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,050
Do you know what tomorrow is?

850
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:57,990
Tomorrow?

851
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,390
Is it something special?

852
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,870
We are on a quest.

853
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,030
We are!

854
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,490
A Minty quest.

855
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,210
Oh!

856
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,370
I knew there would be a village.

857
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:17,430
Come on.

858
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,130
Pillage.

859
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:22,710
The village.

860
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:23,810
Pillage.

861
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:24,310
The village.

862
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,070
What are you...

863
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:30,350
What?

864
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:31,670
Huh?

865
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,070
What?

866
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:36,950
I'm a...

867
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,010
I'm a dillo.

868
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,230
What?

869
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,470
Wait, can I take him?

870
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,050
How do I pick you up?

871
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,390
Wait, what do they like to eat?

872
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,350
An armadillo?

873
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,810
When did they add this?

874
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,430
When did they add this?

875
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,510
When did they add this?

876
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,690
Hold on, I want to hear what they sound like.

877
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,060
The other day?

878
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,540
Wait, what do you mean the other day?

879
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,400
These are brand new?

880
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,400
Oh my god, they are so cute.

881
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,840
What is your purpose?

882
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,000
What?

883
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,180
Why do you exist?

884
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,460
What?

885
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,400
That is a chancre.

886
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,300
Don't fall in there.

887
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,760
Can they swim?

888
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,160
Look at him go.

889
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,640
His purpose is to be silly.

890
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,100
So true.

891
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,220
Oh my gosh.

892
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,520
First we got the wolves.

893
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,380
What else is new?

894
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,160
Oh my gosh.

895
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,800
It's like I'm playing Minecraft again for the first time.

896
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,620
Which is today.

897
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:56,620
Hello?

898
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,320
I'll take that.

899
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,560
Fine.

900
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,520
You have no job.

901
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,160
I was going to say a functioning village, but not quite.

902
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,680
I was going to say a functioning village, but not quite.

903
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,100
Mhmm.

904
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,620
Mhmm.

905
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:20,640
Hahaha.

906
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,880
Their purpose is to be slaughtered to make armors for dogs.

907
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,660
I know you're lying.

908
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,580
I know you're lying.

909
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,100
Don't say that.

910
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,820
I know you're lying.

911
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:42,880
Wow.

912
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,300
Stealing your food.

913
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,680
Wait, is that gonna...

914
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,100
How's it doing that?

915
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,700
How's your water just sitting there like that?

916
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,040
How's that happening?

917
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,120
Potion?

918
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,520
Do you have any beds?

919
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,760
Like where do you...

920
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,240
Where do you rest?

921
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,080
Oh!

922
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:20,900
Oh!

923
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:21,080
Woah!

924
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,640
Woah!

925
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,100
Heck yeah.

926
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:35,650
Can't see anything.

927
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,870
Where do you sleep?

928
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,530
Oh, up there probably.

929
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,150
How'd they get up there?

930
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,330
In here maybe?

931
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:53,530
No.

932
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:56,690
Is that like a temple?

933
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:57,250
Cool.

934
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:00,970
My bed now.

935
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:04,590
The shader...

936
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:07,710
This shader night darkness is crunchy with the video compression.

937
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:08,710
Oh no, really?

938
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:11,490
Take that.

939
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:12,190
Thank you.

940
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:16,070
May you never have a restful night again.

941
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:17,670
Solidus.

942
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:22,730
Crunchy.

943
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:24,590
Good morning world!

944
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,850
Good morning...

945
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:31,550
Minto!

946
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:38,850
Delicious.

947
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,230
Food that's not made by me is awesome.

948
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:47,350
You know?

949
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,010
Oha Minto!

950
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,070
Oha Minto.

951
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,690
I think I'm gonna steal that armadillo.

952
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,330
But also I'm curious if I kill him and see what happens.

953
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:07,070
I'm curious about death.

954
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:08,910
And killing.

955
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:13,870
She said the thing.

956
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,220
Oh there they go!

957
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,480
You can do it!

958
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,280
Just press space!

959
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,680
Oh!

960
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:37,560
You almost made it.

961
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,100
You almost made it.

962
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,180
Oh!

963
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,320
Are we good?

964
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,900
Are we back?

965
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:49,500
Are we back?

966
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,510
That wasn't YouTube.

967
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:59,770
I said OBS disconnected for a second.

968
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,760
Windows noises.

969
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:06,920
We're back?

970
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,380
That was so weird.

971
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,980
Surprised me even.

972
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,180
Classic OBS.

973
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:27,710
I won't tell you that that slip up to recover from a...

974
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:28,510
Wait.

975
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,910
That you use that slip up to recover from a death.

976
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:31,390
Don't worry.

977
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:33,650
What are you talking about?

978
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,330
What are you talking about?

979
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,350
I'm alive and I'm healthy and well.

980
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:42,990
I'll never die.

981
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:44,150
In this game.

982
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:45,230
I'm already dead.

983
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:49,350
I'll never die in game.

984
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:51,790
I've never died in game before.

985
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:56,650
Don't use that opportunity to create a montage of every...

986
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,200
What's going on?

987
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,220
What's going on?

988
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,080
Why do I keep disconnecting?

989
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,520
We're back?

990
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,640
Turtle six for the super.

991
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,500
Super chat.

992
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,100
I just saw.

993
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:36,940
Will you play with him?

994
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:37,920
Yeah, she loves Minecraft.

995
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,880
Yeah, I want to play with him.

996
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,240
Armadillo?

997
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:43,220
Where?

998
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,400
He's roll...

999
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,880
Oh my god.

1000
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,460
I thought he was a...

1001
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,740
If I run past them, they roll up?

1002
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:54,880
Stop.

1003
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:55,660
That's so cute.

1004
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:56,860
Kick him.

1005
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:58,820
Kick him.

1006
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:00,500
Play soccer.

1007
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,560
I'm playing soccer with this armadillo until OBS is better.

1008
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,940
If you run past them, they just curl up into a little tiny ball.

1009
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,240
How did he get all the way down there?

1010
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,140
Did he roll?

1011
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:29,900
Can they roll?

1012
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:30,700
What?

1013
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,000
He was just up here.

1014
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,560
Right?

1015
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,220
I'm not crazy.

1016
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,040
There's no other guy.

1017
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,120
You kicked him.

1018
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:44,940
I didn't kick him.

1019
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,200
I didn't kick him.

1020
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,420
Okay.

1021
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,060
I'm gonna commit a crime.

1022
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,600
Armadillo shields himself.

1023
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,500
Armadillo peeks.

1024
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:10,980
Hold on.

1025
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,680
Leave the poor things alone.

1026
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,060
You guys said it's for armor.

1027
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,560
He didn't drop anything.

1028
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,180
Dog armor.

1029
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,380
Um...

1030
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:38,800
My bad.

1031
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,900
Oh, I should have done that when OBS disconnected.

1032
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,180
I should have taken the chance.

1033
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,960
When OBS disconnected to be a real criminal.

1034
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,640
Did that make you feel powerful?

1035
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,000
I'm not mad.

1036
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,360
No.

1037
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:12,980
So... I'm not quite sure how I feel right now.

1038
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,060
I do feel a little bit evil.

1039
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,420
And I like that feeling.

1040
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,280
Add it to the list of crimes.

1041
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:28,780
Crimes!

1042
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,400
I have no list of crimes, you guys.

1043
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,320
I'm a ghost maid.

1044
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,500
I know I just finished watching Akiba maid war in those games.

1045
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,400
In that series, they're all criminals, but not me.

1046
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,780
Let's go punch some more wood.

1047
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,480
Actually, no, I think we're good.

1048
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,600
We might even be able to make stone.

1049
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:00,660
Me?

1050
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:01,540
I'm a simp?

1051
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,300
Did you see Kojima's tweet about saying not bad?

1052
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:07,920
Really?

1053
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,500
No, I didn't see that, actually.

1054
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,160
What was his first choice?

1055
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,460
It was probably something too expensive.

1056
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,740
Go away.

1057
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:25,990
He didn't say.

1058
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:29,070
But Sing was so perfect.

1059
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,270
People are saying it was Imagine.

1060
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:37,730
No, Sing was... I can't imagine...

1061
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,670
I can't imagine it being anything like that.

1062
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:40,250
Anything other than Sing.

1063
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:46,730
I don't want to imagine another song.

1064
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:48,630
Or I'll cry.

1065
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,670
I can see it being Imagine.

1066
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:53,810
What?

1067
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:54,570
What is Imagine?

1068
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:59,110
Is that Elton John?

1069
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:02,570
There's a fire.

1070
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:09,790
Imagine all the people.

1071
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:12,210
No, see, it doesn't fit the vibe.

1072
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,370
Wait, that's the Beatles, right?

1073
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:19,470
Oh, John Lemon.

1074
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,370
Imagine Dragons.

1075
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:33,740
Len.

1076
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:50,680
Nice.

1077
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,320
No, it burned.

1078
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,640
My food burned.

1079
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,300
The Beagles.

1080
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,500
No, I said the Beatles.

1081
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:10,990
For what purpose?

1082
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:12,450
To have a fried chicken.

1083
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:14,270
Duh.

1084
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,330
Think smarter, not harder.

1085
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:22,990
Thanks for coming back, Mint.

1086
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:24,750
You're welcome.

1087
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:26,190
I could have just...

1088
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:30,130
I should have taken the opportunity to book it.

1089
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:32,650
I should have taken the opportunity to run.

1090
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:37,990
Mint, you've changed.

1091
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,870
This is what Minecraft does to you.

1092
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:43,830
It turns you into a psychopath, I think.

1093
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,910
No, I've always been the same.

1094
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:53,130
I've always been the same.

1095
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,090
Think smarter, not harder.

1096
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:58,450
What?

1097
00:53:58,450 --> 00:53:59,410
What do you mean, what?

1098
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,630
That's a real phrase.

1099
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:02,510
Right every...

1100
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:02,910
Oh, gosh.

1101
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:04,630
We're okay.

1102
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:06,490
That's a real phrase.

1103
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:07,310
It means...

1104
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,530
It means...

1105
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:11,570
Think smarter, not harder.

1106
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:16,010
Where you will do something because it's easier.

1107
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,280
Work smart...

1108
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:22,820
Wait, what do you mean?

1109
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,840
What did I say?

1110
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:28,780
Oh.

1111
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,320
I'm thinking harder, you guys.

1112
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,600
Maybe I do need to think harder.

1113
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:56,450
Maybe I do need to think harder.

1114
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:59,570
What did she mean by this?

1115
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:00,590
I don't need...

1116
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:01,430
I don't think.

1117
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:01,930
I don't know.

1118
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:05,670
I don't even think.

1119
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:06,650
Okay.

1120
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:10,410
We're gonna go find some place to sleep tonight.

1121
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,450
Some place I won't be disturbed.

1122
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,010
What is this?

1123
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:19,690
Rock formation.

1124
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:21,910
Lava.

1125
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:24,970
Shiori.

1126
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:27,010
Thank you for the gift.

1127
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:28,150
Thank you.

1128
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:31,870
Thank you so much.

1129
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:32,550
Thank you.

1130
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:32,850
Thank you.

1131
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:33,770
Okay.

1132
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:35,730
I think we can sleep on top of this tiny block.

1133
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:38,350
Here's my...

1134
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:39,410
Ben.

1135
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:40,390
Ben.

1136
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:40,690
Whatever this is...

1137
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:41,470
Put it down...

1138
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:43,030
Nice.

1139
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,180
Woohoo!

1140
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,520
Alrighty.

1141
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,200
I'm back on my...

1142
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,740
linking back to my full spit.

1143
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,060
Okay.

1144
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:07,610
All right guys.

1145
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:10,450
I hope we didn't interrupt you while we were sleeping tonight with the� just there like, ''What's she doing?!

1146
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:10,770
''.

1147
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:11,630
Wohoo!

1148
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:13,010
I don't know what I'm doing.

1149
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:13,110
What am I doing?

1150
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:18,870
I'm playing... I'm playing... Minecraft.

1151
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,470
Sorry, should I have said your full name?

1152
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,950
Shiori Novella Novelite.

1153
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:29,170
Wait, it's blocked off the rest of it.

1154
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:31,730
Hold on.

1155
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,310
I can't see your name, but thanks for the gift!

1156
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,460
Let's go this way.

1157
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,860
Next village we find, we're gonna bring them the gift of maids.

1158
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,700
A maid cafe.

1159
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,600
In their area.

1160
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,440
This area kinda sucks.

1161
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,400
Dolphins!

1162
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,900
I'm so... what else?

1163
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:05,480
Wait, okay.

1164
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,720
What else have they added in the Minecraft then?

1165
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,260
They added armadillos and they added...

1166
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,000
What else have they added with the wolves?

1167
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,600
Maybe we can go on a hunt for that.

1168
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:23,900
Camels.

1169
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,300
Music.

1170
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,900
They got burgers now?

1171
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,520
They added the deep dark?

1172
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,120
I've been there before.

1173
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,940
I just, you know, we can go.

1174
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,040
It's just, you know...

1175
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,980
I'm too cool for the deep dark.

1176
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,720
They added some new discs.

1177
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,080
Guns?

1178
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:45,980
Burgers?

1179
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:46,440
Wait, really?

1180
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:46,960
Burgers?

1181
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,000
And then...

1182
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,860
First we have Shiori, then we have Narisa Ravencroft's...

1183
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:04,300
All I see is Ass!

1184
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,200
Her Ravencroftses!

1185
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,680
Thank you.

1186
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,240
Thank you for the five gifted.

1187
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,840
Oh my gosh.

1188
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:19,640
Orgh!

1189
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:23,420
I can't believe Advent is watching my stream.

1190
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,120
Oh my goodness, what an honor.

1191
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:33,360
Fire, fire, light the fire.

1192
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:40,240
Dancing to the... something, something.

1193
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,740
To a new world.

1194
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,060
Alright, thank you for the five gifted.

1195
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:51,560
Thank you!

1196
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,120
They added circles.

1197
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,620
Don't lie to me.

1198
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:57,520
This is Minecraft.

1199
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,000
This is Minecraft.

1200
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,920
We need bibu and flamako.

1201
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,800
I think you have to stick your giat out now.

1202
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:19,460
Will that summon bibu?

1203
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:28,920
Wow, how lucky.

1204
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,780
I just stopped here, but I think it's actually a spot.

1205
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,100
I think it's actually a nasty spot.

1206
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,280
For nasty people.

1207
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,240
I don't want to die here.

1208
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,380
By drowning.

1209
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,120
Wait, I'm going to become one of them?

1210
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:45,960
Oh gosh.

1211
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,460
That was close.

1212
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,960
Coming out, idiot.

1213
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,740
Don't you know how to leave?

1214
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:01,120
Is there anything in here?

1215
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,040
I can't see.

1216
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:03,400
Oh wait.

1217
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,040
Monster.

1218
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:20,370
Maybe there's a chest.

1219
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:24,490
I don't have a thing to get the sussy sand if there is any.

1220
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:25,970
That's a sussy sand.

1221
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:30,710
What's wrong with me?

1222
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:34,790
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god.

1223
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:44,050
There's another fire over there, you guys.

1224
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:46,490
Everything's setting on fire.

1225
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:48,990
Oh my god.

1226
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:57,370
Koseki, bibu, sparkling platinum, jane of hololive, and thank you for the 10 gifted.

1227
01:00:57,370 --> 01:00:59,310
Oh here, I was going to do this.

1228
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:04,730
Sticking out your gut for realiz... wait, nerizzler.

1229
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:07,730
Your soapy butax.

1230
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:19,690
Is there anything in here?

1231
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:20,970
I don't want to destroy the sussy...

1232
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:22,030
Oh no!

1233
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:23,910
I can't open it.

1234
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:25,470
I have to destroy the sussy sand.

1235
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:28,090
How do we make the thing?

1236
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:35,830
How do we make...

1237
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:47,210
Copper and feathers.

1238
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:49,610
What's it called though?

1239
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:50,670
Oh my god.

1240
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:57,570
Flower, moccoco, top, doggy, holy, defender, thank you for the 50 gifted.

1241
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:58,190
Thank you.

1242
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,650
Oh my gosh, advent.

1243
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:05,470
We got them all.

1244
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:10,090
I feel like the Pokemon master right now.

1245
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,680
The infinity stones.

1246
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,560
Welcome to membership, thank you so much.

1247
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,520
What is this thing called?

1248
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:24,580
Sand?

1249
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,680
No, brush.

1250
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:27,660
No.

1251
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:29,720
What's it called?

1252
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,080
Maybe I haven't unlocked it yet so I can't see it.

1253
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:36,760
Maybe I haven't unlocked it so it won't show me this.

1254
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,320
But let's go find some...

1255
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:43,060
Some...

1256
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:48,410
I think there probably will be some over here.

1257
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:49,410
Copper.

1258
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:51,150
Get bibu taxed.

1259
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:52,770
Utano!

1260
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,530
Welcome to membership, thank you!

1261
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:58,750
Oh, no.

1262
01:02:58,850 --> 01:02:59,370
That's iron.

1263
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:00,430
Actually, we need this though.

1264
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:09,370
Can I go plant this?

1265
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:22,720
Perfect.

1266
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,940
Bibu, welcome to membership, thank you!

1267
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,920
Al and Chocobo, welcome to membership, thank you!

1268
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:34,580
What's this?

1269
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:37,020
Furnace.

1270
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,180
Oh my gosh, we are actually playing the game now.

1271
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:43,860
That's kind of crazy.

1272
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,080
Okay.

1273
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:51,430
Welcome to membership!

1274
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:52,330
Take!

1275
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:56,730
Does that mean you're kind of Captain Planet now or something?

1276
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:04,810
With my five powers combined, I'm Captain Planet!

1277
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:07,930
How did that song go?

1278
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:12,730
Actually, I don't remember how the Captain Planet song used to go.

1279
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,370
I didn't see this went live.

1280
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:17,150
Hello!

1281
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:20,610
I'm Captain Planet.

1282
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,290
Captain Planet, he's a hero.

1283
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:27,210
Gonna take pollution down to zero.

1284
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:31,450
Gonna something plunder and...

1285
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,270
Go to village, he will plunder.

1286
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:38,190
Take everything till they surrender.

1287
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,330
Did not rhyme.

1288
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:40,850
Brush.

1289
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:41,610
Oh!

1290
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:42,010
Oh!

1291
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:42,350
Oh!

1292
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:43,710
Oh, feather!

1293
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:44,730
We need a feather.

1294
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:46,430
Oh my gosh.

1295
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:49,090
There's gotta be chickens around here.

1296
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:53,390
Oh, I don't know why I even thought that would be...

1297
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:56,170
There's gotta be chickens here.

1298
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:00,350
There's gotta be chickens.

1299
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:09,650
We're playing hardcore mode, you guys.

1300
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:13,030
If I die, we'll never know what's in those sands.

1301
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:16,350
We'll never know.

1302
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:19,590
That'll be my life.

1303
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:20,790
Actually, I'm gonna go get my bed.

1304
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:22,770
I'm gonna go get my bed.

1305
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:24,570
So we can...

1306
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:26,250
When it gets actually dark, we can sleep.

1307
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:27,750
Pew!

1308
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:28,110
Pew!

1309
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:28,530
Pew!

1310
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:33,130
Go!

1311
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:34,530
Thank you for the silver Fangs!

1312
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:42,130
I need bread.

1313
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:46,090
I should also make my meat.

1314
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:50,110
Gonna go make my meat.

1315
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:51,130
Instead of copper.

1316
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:57,830
Welcome to membership.

1317
01:05:59,090 --> 01:05:59,930
Thank you.

1318
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:01,870
Meat.

1319
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:06,950
Alright, let's go look for a chicken.

1320
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:09,890
I just need one damn chicken.

1321
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:12,750
One damn chicken!

1322
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:22,250
I need two damn chickens.

1323
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:24,470
Did I get it?

1324
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:25,350
Oh, here, here, here.

1325
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:28,890
Run!

1326
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:33,670
Oh, it's getting dark out.

1327
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:34,590
Wait, I'm scared.

1328
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:37,670
Oh, I can sleep.

1329
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:43,330
Now you can feed Paz.

1330
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:44,110
No!

1331
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:46,230
I don't think she can have chicken!

1332
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:50,070
I think she's allergic to chicken.

1333
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:50,610
Oh, brush.

1334
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:53,670
We are so back.

1335
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:56,370
Nice.

1336
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:57,990
Okay, it's my...

1337
01:06:58,650 --> 01:06:59,970
Okay, okay.

1338
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:01,430
Sussy sand.

1339
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:03,290
Destroy sussy sand.

1340
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,570
Get stuff from...

1341
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:08,630
the temple.

1342
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:17,540
You just have to train her.

1343
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,260
Woohoo!

1344
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,120
Oh gosh.

1345
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:29,580
Okay, I have a shovel.

1346
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:30,440
I have a shovel.

1347
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,600
Use your shovel!

1348
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:33,260
Mint, what is wrong with you?

1349
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:34,560
Why won't you...

1350
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,880
Why would you use your shovel when you have...

1351
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:45,330
Treasure map.

1352
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:53,860
An emerald!

1353
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:05,000
Oh, thank goodness this is not any further deeper.

1354
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,820
Or we'd be so done-zo.

1355
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,460
Did I make...

1356
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:12,100
Oh yeah, here it is.

1357
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:16,400
Undersea treasure.

1358
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,280
Treasure!

1359
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:18,580
Treasure!

1360
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:19,180
Treasure!

1361
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,460
Greetings from the Redmond side of Mojang.

1362
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:26,380
Welcome back!

1363
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:27,820
Thanks!

1364
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:31,800
Huh?

1365
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:36,650
From Mojang?

1366
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:38,590
Real?

1367
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:55,690
Nah.

1368
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:57,770
I

1369
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,680
can never tell when people are pulling my leg, you know?

1370
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:08,590
What a peculiar map.

1371
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:13,430
Mr Mojang himself!

1372
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:17,070
Let's see.

1373
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:18,170
What can I get rid of?

1374
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:20,170
My dirt is really important.

1375
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:21,530
But I think...

1376
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:26,070
We'll put it like that.

1377
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:28,910
People need to know someone's been here.

1378
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:31,890
I will become the Herobrine of this world.

1379
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:34,010
Take my food.

1380
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:44,050
A mint-merled... yes.

1381
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:45,510
Papita, thank you for the vibe!

1382
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:46,130
Gifted!

1383
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:47,230
Thank you so much!

1384
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:51,390
Yeah, I'm going back for my stuff in here.

1385
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:51,970
No worries.

1386
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:54,810
But also, we have more... oh shoot.

1387
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:56,290
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1388
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:57,330
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1389
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:58,910
More sussy, sussy, sussy.

1390
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:02,370
What is that?

1391
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:03,530
Gold?

1392
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:04,230
Gold.

1393
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:06,090
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1394
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:12,850
Down.

1395
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:15,450
Anymore?

1396
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:16,090
Oh, here.

1397
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:24,440
You know, you say put a door underwater to breathe.

1398
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,720
Like you're some kind of genius or something.

1399
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:32,100
You know, like you're some kind of like, you know...

1400
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:36,920
Person that knows... you know, this is the thrill.

1401
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,720
You know, the thrill of maybe not making it back.

1402
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:46,460
I gotta feel like I might die in the ruins, okay?

1403
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:49,060
Like that.

1404
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:53,870
What a thrill.

1405
01:10:54,050 --> 01:11:00,470
You and Murphy were bad influences on me and now I'm officially importing a brand new Vuelix arcade cabinet from Japan.

1406
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:08,170
I don't know what Murphy did to be a bad influence...

1407
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:08,770
Warner!

1408
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:14,230
Why did we get such a sad... a sad one?

1409
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,350
Oh yeah, let's make the rest of our copper.

1410
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:23,990
We don't really need it, but...

1411
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:30,720
Somebody died.

1412
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:31,420
Me!

1413
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,680
Oh my gosh, we can put it in the maid cafe.

1414
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:37,460
We can put it in the maid cafe.

1415
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:37,780
Perfect.

1416
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:42,000
Alrighty, let's get my pottery... I mean my...

1417
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:44,340
Actually, I am gonna take this.

1418
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:45,940
Here.

1419
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,160
Hurry.

1420
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:48,680
Please.

1421
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:49,420
Axe.

1422
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,580
The little axe that could.

1423
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:50,960
Please!

1424
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,080
Please axe!

1425
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:00,360
I don't think I got it.

1426
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:02,960
What can I lose?

1427
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,440
What can I lose?

1428
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,500
That was close.

1429
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:09,240
That was close.

1430
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:10,960
That was close.

1431
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:11,840
See the thrill.

1432
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,320
The thrill of death.

1433
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:17,860
Knocking at your door.

1434
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,440
Remembers that a door is your...

1435
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:33,840
No, no.

1436
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:34,800
You don't want the door.

1437
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:35,240
We're...

1438
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:36,800
We're...

1439
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,720
We're doing it...

1440
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:40,460
Oh.

1441
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,300
Oh, I don't need that.

1442
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,060
What did I just throw?

1443
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,360
Where's my...

1444
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:48,620
Oh.

1445
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,380
What am I grabbing?

1446
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:55,940
Where's my...

1447
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,020
How did that even get out there?

1448
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,140
I threw my brush?

1449
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,560
Where is the...

1450
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:14,980
Why isn't it picking it up?

1451
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,320
Eh?

1452
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:17,680
Uh...

1453
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:19,740
Uh...

1454
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,000
You guys?

1455
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,760
I have an empty spot.

1456
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:35,310
Oh, I somehow got rotten flesh.

1457
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:41,680
Ghost chest.

1458
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:46,100
And my...

1459
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:48,240
My bamboo is missing too.

1460
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,400
That's what I was trying to say earlier.

1461
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,340
Where's the bamboo?

1462
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,480
Eh?

1463
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:02,720
Kargura...

1464
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:04,200
Chonbot...

1465
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:06,400
Chonbot Association.

1466
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:07,620
Thank you for the...

1467
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:10,000
Thank you for the birthday gift.

1468
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,840
You dropped the bamboo for space earlier in the diving.

1469
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:18,660
Did I?

1470
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,020
No, I thought I put it in the chest.

1471
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:21,640
Did I not?

1472
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:23,240
Did we lose the bamboo?

1473
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,380
It's okay.

1474
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,200
It was just one.

1475
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,100
It was just one.

1476
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:30,220
Let's go.

1477
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:30,860
Treasure hunting.

1478
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:32,520
Surely we'll find it.

1479
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,460
We'll find something good.

1480
01:14:58,030 --> 01:14:58,470
Tingling.

1481
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:02,790
There was a whole bamboo block.

1482
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:03,910
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1483
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:04,290
Right?

1484
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:05,870
But it disappeared.

1485
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:07,810
So strange.

1486
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:10,950
Maybe I am getting Herobrine.

1487
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:12,230
Fire charge.

1488
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:16,990
We're gonna take that back.

1489
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:19,530
We're gonna transfer all of...

1490
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:19,930
Oh.

1491
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:20,950
No, no, no, no.

1492
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:21,750
No, no, no.

1493
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:22,630
Don't burn it.

1494
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:25,090
We're gonna turn all of this into wood.

1495
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:26,810
Okay.

1496
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:31,010
I ate it.

1497
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:31,530
Oh my gosh.

1498
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:32,510
I thought that was a person.

1499
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:35,030
Scared me.

1500
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:35,630
Okay.

1501
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:39,170
No.

1502
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:44,330
So weird that it wouldn't pick up the chest earlier.

1503
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:48,390
Herobrine.

1504
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:50,650
Okay.

1505
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:08,470
Let's go get us a treasure.

1506
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:12,590
It wasn't in the mood.

1507
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,170
We are...

1508
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:15,410
Okay.

1509
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:17,910
We're north east.

1510
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:20,350
We need to go north.

1511
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:21,510
No.

1512
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:21,870
South.

1513
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:24,870
We are north.

1514
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:26,950
Okay.

1515
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:49,560
We are north.

1516
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:50,760
We are north.

1517
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:51,460
We are north.

1518
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:52,660
We are fighting dreamers actually.

1519
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:57,620
We are fighting dreamers.

1520
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:01,780
We are fighting dreamers.

1521
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:02,800
See?

1522
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:04,020
Snakes are the 10 gifted.

1523
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,620
Why is everybody gifting so much today?

1524
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:06,640
What is going on?

1525
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:15,830
We're going off into the sunset.

1526
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:19,850
Oh.

1527
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:22,010
Maybe I should go to sleep.

1528
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:22,710
No.

1529
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:24,750
Let's go sleep over here.

1530
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:27,290
Actually, no.

1531
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:32,890
Part of the thrill is digging the treasure when you could die.

1532
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:39,970
Oh, I'm speaking of.

1533
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:47,250
Ducky, thanks for the...

1534
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:48,310
Wow!

1535
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:56,930
Thanks for the five gifts and thank you so much.

1536
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:58,810
Fighting dreamers.

1537
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:02,850
We are fighting dreamers.

1538
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:05,690
I've never watched Naruto.

1539
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:08,170
Fighting dreamers.

1540
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:12,870
ID number one?

1541
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:14,510
Wait, what does that mean?

1542
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:15,750
ID number zero.

1543
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:18,170
Oh, maybe because I'm holding...

1544
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:20,890
Ramak, thanks for the gift.

1545
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:26,910
Hmm...

1546
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,300
Yeah, fine.

1547
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:42,540
Here's a super chat instead.

1548
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,600
I didn't ask for that either.

1549
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:49,950
Are we going the wrong way?

1550
01:18:50,330 --> 01:18:50,770
West.

1551
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:55,790
South.

1552
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:56,910
Sockle.

1553
01:18:58,990 --> 01:18:59,430
Sockle.

1554
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:03,190
Oh my god.

1555
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:04,910
Chili Dutchies.

1556
01:19:06,570 --> 01:19:08,270
I think we gotta go through the land.

1557
01:19:08,530 --> 01:19:08,630
Hello.

1558
01:19:10,890 --> 01:19:12,690
Alright, time to fight for our lives.

1559
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:17,390
Actually, I'm just gonna go to sleep.

1560
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:24,220
Thanks, new ring.

1561
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:24,940
Uh oh.

1562
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:25,700
Are we gonna die?

1563
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:28,640
Hey!

1564
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:29,300
Hey!

1565
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:29,640
Hey!

1566
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:30,480
It's daytime!

1567
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:31,380
It's daytime!

1568
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:32,580
Oh my god.

1569
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:33,240
Oh my god.

1570
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:42,200
Ugh.

1571
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:42,640
Ugh.

1572
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:43,620
Ugh.

1573
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:51,350
Ugh.

1574
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:54,950
It's raw!

1575
01:19:58,870 --> 01:20:03,240
Did you guys get scared?

1576
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:04,520
Don't get scared.

1577
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,800
Don't get scared.

1578
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,540
Everything was under control.

1579
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:12,920
I had it all under control.

1580
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:24,150
See, just listen to peaceful music.

1581
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:28,050
Actually, I am gonna turn my game down just a wee bit.

1582
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:37,060
How are you still alive?

1583
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,280
Oh gosh.

1584
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:48,620
Why is he...

1585
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:48,900
Why is he...

1586
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:49,520
glowing?

1587
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:51,820
Oh my god.

1588
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:52,640
It's still so loud.

1589
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:10,880
Spiders can spawn with buffs?

1590
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,780
Oh, there's another guy.

1591
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:14,840
Wait, this guy has armor.

1592
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:17,560
Wait, I kinda need you.

1593
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:18,780
Gimme your stuff.

1594
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,180
Gimme your stuff.

1595
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:23,360
Dang.

1596
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,700
Why do you have buffs?

1597
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:29,200
What are his buffs?

1598
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:37,420
Anyway, where were we going?

1599
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,400
Oh no, we're past it.

1600
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:40,860
We need to go...

1601
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:42,020
north?

1602
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,660
And then...

1603
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:53,460
we need to go...

1604
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:54,880
west.

1605
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:57,600
This way?

1606
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:06,880
This way?

1607
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,080
Are we doing it?

1608
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:13,800
No, this way.

1609
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:14,580
This way?

1610
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:16,440
No?

1611
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:20,060
I'm confused.

1612
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,180
My feet hurt.

1613
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:22,900
Are we there yet?

1614
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:24,680
I think I'm lost.

1615
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,020
More west.

1616
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:31,630
This way.

1617
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:32,790
This way is west.

1618
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:37,270
This is like the most west we could go.

1619
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:39,070
This is like the most west we could go.

1620
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:39,750
Absolute west.

1621
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:46,570
This way.

1622
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:49,850
No, this way.

1623
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:51,770
More west.

1624
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:54,290
Are we almost there?

1625
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:56,470
No.

1626
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:00,580
I don't think so.

1627
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:02,160
I don't think so.

1628
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:05,380
What are your favorite mods for Minecraft?

1629
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:08,740
What are your favorite mods for Minecraft?

1630
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,700
What mods do you enjoy the most?

1631
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:14,280
What mods do you enjoy the most?

1632
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:14,880
Got your nose.

1633
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,360
What are you talking about?

1634
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:18,440
What are you talking about?

1635
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,020
Wait, I'm in my bed.

1636
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:27,640
Like this.

1637
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:29,320
Like this.

1638
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,020
Oh!

1639
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:33,620
Pies!

1640
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:34,880
Can you guys hear her?

1641
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:38,000
Pies, come here.

1642
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:39,760
Pies, come here.

1643
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:39,860
Come here.

1644
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,980
I think she wants out.

1645
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:44,240
She's a...

1646
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:45,440
She's kind of a...

1647
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,880
Are you yawning?

1648
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:49,200
I thought there was something in the game, but it was her.

1649
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:51,900
She's so, so cute.

1650
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,060
Come here, pies.

1651
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:55,240
Come here, come here.

1652
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,660
She doesn't listen very well though.

1653
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:01,220
This whole time?

1654
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:02,520
Let's have my tongue out.

1655
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:05,540
Come here.

1656
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:06,960
Come here.

1657
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,220
Stop honking.

1658
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:08,640
Come here.

1659
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:11,740
Come here, come here.

1660
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:13,200
She doesn't listen very well.

1661
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:15,800
I don't think she like...

1662
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,160
Come here.

1663
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,600
You sweet girl.

1664
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,240
Yes, you are.

1665
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:23,960
She just wants out.

1666
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:25,200
Give me one second.

1667
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:42,450
I think she opened the door.

1668
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:43,450
But I think she's hungry.

1669
01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:45,750
Do you guys mind if I feed her real quick?

1670
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:48,370
Give me two seconds to go feed my cat.

1671
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:49,190
Okay, I'm so sorry.

1672
01:24:49,850 --> 01:24:51,130
We'll get some sweet jazz moments.

1673
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:52,610
Give me one second.

1674
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:53,650
I'm just gonna feed her real quick.

1675
01:26:39,190 --> 01:26:40,070
I'm so sorry.

1676
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:40,630
I'm back.

1677
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:42,430
I'll grab some snacks for me too.

1678
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:43,450
I...

1679
01:26:44,710 --> 01:26:45,190
I...

1680
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:47,750
I have no idea how she opened the door.

1681
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:50,370
Because I shut it.

1682
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:51,870
It's so weird.

1683
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:56,150
Anyway.

1684
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:05,150
Clever girl.

1685
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:08,490
She is clever.

1686
01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:10,450
Hmm.

1687
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:12,750
Hmm.

1688
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:22,680
Wait, I was so close.

1689
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:27,970
Wait, I was so close.

1690
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:29,710
Wait, I was so close.

1691
01:27:29,710 --> 01:27:30,110
Wait, I was so close.

1692
01:27:30,430 --> 01:27:31,570
What are we, crunching?

1693
01:27:31,570 --> 01:27:32,910
Sorry, I got like a little...

1694
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:35,150
Sorry, I got like a little...

1695
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:36,530
I got...

1696
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:40,110
I have some snacks still from when I was in Japan.

1697
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:43,290
I have some snacks still from when I was in Japan.

1698
01:27:55,030 --> 01:27:56,850
It's not in the water, though.

1699
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:58,530
Is it?

1700
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:00,130
West.

1701
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:04,750
This way.

1702
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:08,840
This way?

1703
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:15,800
How member please.

1704
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:27,740
Um maybe maybe you can get lucky and so we'll gift it but fortunately I can't tell you other but it's okay you don't have to member don't worry about it.

1705
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:31,560
Village.

1706
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:35,660
Here.

1707
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:42,620
Please don't break.

1708
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:49,140
Oh nice.

1709
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,160
Paperbacks thanks for the five gifted.

1710
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:55,940
Thank you.

1711
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:02,660
No I must.

1712
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:13,920
I don't want anyone ever to feel like they have to um you know do something to like support me you know.

1713
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,860
Iron sword.

1714
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:17,780
Let's go baby.

1715
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:20,380
Let's get some food.

1716
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:22,960
You know what maybe I don't need the wool.

1717
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:25,340
Hard to see I don't think we really need.

1718
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:28,400
We don't really need.

1719
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,200
Um Take that though.

1720
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:32,700
Check that.

1721
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:34,280
And oh wait.

1722
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:35,260
Is this the same map?

1723
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:37,000
00.

1724
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:37,440
Yes.

1725
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:43,040
So he can get rid of the maps too.

1726
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:44,260
Very good.

1727
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:46,860
Spades.

1728
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:49,620
Speaking of JP Snacks, Jagariko, crunchy or stale?

1729
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:54,490
Crunchy.

1730
01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:55,910
I think.

1731
01:30:00,130 --> 01:30:06,710
I don't know, I used to be a Jagabi fan because I thought it was a little softer and I kind of like that, but...

1732
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:13,050
I mean, I thought they are softer than Jagariko, but now I'm kind of more for the Jagariko.

1733
01:30:18,890 --> 01:30:25,010
But for a long time, for a long long time, I was always for the Jagabi.

1734
01:30:27,190 --> 01:30:28,050
Which do you like?

1735
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:29,270
Jagariko or Jagabi?

1736
01:30:42,530 --> 01:30:44,010
Umami flavor is high quality too.

1737
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:46,010
Kathleen, thanks for the tiny gift.

1738
01:30:47,070 --> 01:30:48,830
Jagabi, Jagabi, Jagariko, Jagariko.

1739
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:50,150
Haven't had either.

1740
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:51,230
No JP Snacks for me.

1741
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:57,330
Surely you can find some place that has some JP Snacks.

1742
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:01,250
I've wanted to sign up for like a...

1743
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:03,790
I don't know, some sort of like...

1744
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:06,330
What's going on here?

1745
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:10,370
Some sort of JP Snacks service because...

1746
01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:14,070
It's a whole lot of nothing, never mind.

1747
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:18,770
I don't know, it's just kind of fun to like...

1748
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:22,470
To anticipate something in the...

1749
01:31:23,370 --> 01:31:24,810
In the mail, you know what I mean?

1750
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:26,030
Like a monthly like...

1751
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:28,430
I'm gonna... Is that a graveyard?

1752
01:31:32,230 --> 01:31:33,510
I use Bokushu.

1753
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:35,530
I've heard of Bokushu.

1754
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:37,450
Never used it before though.

1755
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:39,390
How about blue?

1756
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:41,010
Bread!

1757
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:42,930
Spruce.

1758
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:50,830
But...

1759
01:31:55,570 --> 01:31:56,210
But...

1760
01:31:57,610 --> 01:31:58,850
They're kind of expensive.

1761
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:00,910
So I've never signed up for one.

1762
01:32:02,370 --> 01:32:04,430
Will you open up a PO box?

1763
01:32:06,170 --> 01:32:09,850
I don't really have plans to at the moment.

1764
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:16,050
Oh my god, there's more fire everywhere we go!

1765
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:19,070
I think Herobrine actually is following us.

1766
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:23,250
I'll see what we can find.

1767
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:25,010
Like, a truck to the Japanese stores in Manhattan.

1768
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:26,170
That's so awesome.

1769
01:32:31,150 --> 01:32:32,310
Yeah, um...

1770
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:34,990
I don't really plan on opening up a PO box...

1771
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:37,990
because I would have to probably manage it myself.

1772
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:42,330
I don't know what if I get something weird in there.

1773
01:32:48,350 --> 01:33:06,150
Maybe hopefully... hopefully I mean I would like a manager and then maybe... once I get a manager, whenever that time comes, I wouldn't be so... a throne?

1774
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:09,310
I don't... I don't know.

1775
01:33:09,530 --> 01:33:15,710
Like I really don't... I would... I only really want a PO box for people to send me... oh my god we have a prisoner!

1776
01:33:17,310 --> 01:33:20,050
Only if people like wanted to send letters, right?

1777
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:24,190
Like I don't want people to feel like they're having to buy me things.

1778
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:26,830
And I don't really... I don't even know what I would put on a throne.

1779
01:33:27,410 --> 01:33:29,630
I kind of already have everything that I want.

1780
01:33:32,370 --> 01:33:41,050
I don't really need... it's kind of like when my mom is like what do you want for your birthday or Christmas?

1781
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:42,030
I'm like I don't know.

1782
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:43,210
I have everything that I need.

1783
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:44,510
Toilet paper!

1784
01:33:51,330 --> 01:33:52,650
More arcade cabinets.

1785
01:33:53,410 --> 01:34:04,330
I went to an electronics store the other day and they had um... they had like tiny Wheel of Fortune cabinets.

1786
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:04,630
Cabinets.

1787
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:09,190
And Tiny... They had other ones.

1788
01:34:09,230 --> 01:34:09,610
What was it?

1789
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:11,250
They had Tiny Wheel of Fortune.

1790
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:14,210
Oh, Tiny... The Buck Wild.

1791
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:16,130
Buck Hunting.

1792
01:34:16,370 --> 01:34:17,070
Go Wild.

1793
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:18,650
They had that too.

1794
01:34:22,850 --> 01:34:23,330
Genji!

1795
01:34:23,470 --> 01:34:24,650
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

1796
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:25,930
Thank you so much!

1797
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:26,530
Thank you!

1798
01:34:29,570 --> 01:34:32,230
You can get the TMNT arcade cabinet?

1799
01:34:32,370 --> 01:34:32,690
Brilliant.

1800
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:35,510
Buck Wild.

1801
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:38,590
Is that what it's called?

1802
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:39,470
Look at that kid.

1803
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:48,290
Wow, this village is nice!

1804
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:51,150
It's really poppin'!

1805
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:54,090
Like, we are good on food.

1806
01:35:00,670 --> 01:35:01,930
He's a scholar.

1807
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:03,990
Skyripa!

1808
01:35:04,170 --> 01:35:05,550
Thank you for the...

1809
01:35:05,890 --> 01:35:07,090
5 gifted!

1810
01:35:07,390 --> 01:35:08,030
Thank you!

1811
01:35:08,110 --> 01:35:09,770
Oh my gosh, this one's 2 stories!

1812
01:35:14,350 --> 01:35:14,870
Nice.

1813
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:17,250
Wow, this is a really nice... It's huge!

1814
01:35:17,610 --> 01:35:20,130
I don't think I've ever seen a village this large before.

1815
01:35:21,530 --> 01:35:22,690
Rich man house.

1816
01:35:23,850 --> 01:35:25,730
Not up to code, but that's okay.

1817
01:35:28,210 --> 01:35:29,250
Rich no more.

1818
01:35:31,470 --> 01:35:31,990
Ouch!

1819
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:37,250
Enjoy this mint colored super chat.

1820
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:38,510
Oh my gosh, Gavin!

1821
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:43,250
Hi, Gavin!

1822
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:43,930
Thank you!

1823
01:35:45,670 --> 01:35:46,630
What the heck?

1824
01:35:47,870 --> 01:35:48,870
What the heck?

1825
01:35:50,830 --> 01:35:51,830
Where's my boat?

1826
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:58,740
The man himself.

1827
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:01,040
This guy made me move.

1828
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:01,320
Ow!

1829
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,520
Oh, get out.

1830
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:10,480
Did I take my boat?

1831
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:11,980
Did I leave it over here?

1832
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:16,540
Where did I leave it at?

1833
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,540
GMG, thank you for another 10 gifted.

1834
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:21,100
Thank you.

1835
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:22,360
Oh, here it is.

1836
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:25,680
Alright, continuing onward.

1837
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:29,800
Wait a second.

1838
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:34,940
Didn't I say the next village we come across, we'll build them a maid cafe?

1839
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:37,880
We'll show them the wonders of maid?

1840
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:40,180
Yeah, make the maid cafe here.

1841
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,480
Yeah, I said that, didn't I?

1842
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:43,020
Okay.

1843
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:45,860
We're gonna make it right here in the town center.

1844
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:47,680
Oh, okay.

1845
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:51,300
I'm already getting opposition...

1846
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:53,500
to our maid cafe.

1847
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:55,660
But that will not deter me.

1848
01:36:58,620 --> 01:37:00,900
I'm already receiving threats.

1849
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:09,100
Divine intervention.

1850
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:24,620
He would love to see a maid cafe outside his house.

1851
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:25,580
I'm just saying.

1852
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,080
That would be his number one priority.

1853
01:37:29,860 --> 01:37:30,600
Flagship cafe.

1854
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:32,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1855
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:40,220
Now, the thing about this maid cafe is we can only make it with stuff that we already have.

1856
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:41,600
So...

1857
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:44,560
So,

1858
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:49,300
it might be...

1859
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:52,840
a place that only a mother could love.

1860
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:54,220
Oh my god.

1861
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:55,900
I thought that was a skele-man.

1862
01:37:58,400 --> 01:37:59,060
Budget cuts?

1863
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:00,480
Pretty much.

1864
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:04,820
Until we get more patrons...

1865
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:08,340
we are flat broke.

1866
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:15,360
We eat seaweed every day.

1867
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,280
Um, let's set up...

1868
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:23,400
a

1869
01:38:27,070 --> 01:38:28,290
furnace.

1870
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:31,590
Okay.

1871
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:32,250
Oop.

1872
01:38:33,890 --> 01:38:36,390
And I'm gonna start burning this, actually.

1873
01:38:37,570 --> 01:38:38,210
Like that.

1874
01:38:38,530 --> 01:38:38,970
Okay.

1875
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:47,140
As a fellow ghost, have you been watching the Space Ghost Coast to Coast live on YouTube?

1876
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,060
I'll be honest.

1877
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:49,880
I actually watched a couple episodes.

1878
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:51,940
I did.

1879
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:53,680
I actually watched it just a little bit.

1880
01:38:53,740 --> 01:38:56,080
But I never watched Space Ghost before.

1881
01:38:58,560 --> 01:38:59,440
So, um...

1882
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:02,360
But it's been showing up in my feed.

1883
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:03,400
So, like, I'm like, yeah.

1884
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:04,000
You know what?

1885
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:08,060
Maybe I will watch some Space Ghost Coast to Coast.

1886
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:11,180
Made Ghost Coast to Coast.

1887
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:13,280
Love Space Ghost.

1888
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,000
I always liked, um...

1889
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:17,080
Uh...

1890
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:19,940
I never had watched it, but I always liked the little...

1891
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:20,860
the little...

1892
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:24,420
bug guy.

1893
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:25,520
What's his name?

1894
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:34,660
But it's funny because I had watched a...

1895
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:36,440
Zorak.

1896
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:38,060
Yeah.

1897
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:38,760
Actually, wait.

1898
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:40,720
There's the other guy.

1899
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:42,580
I don't know how to describe what he said.

1900
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:43,500
How he looks.

1901
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:46,200
The hysterical laughter of Mint makes my day better.

1902
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:49,580
What do you mean by that?

1903
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:53,340
The other guy.

1904
01:39:54,860 --> 01:39:55,380
Motar?

1905
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:56,000
Hold on.

1906
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:56,740
I'm gonna look him up.

1907
01:39:57,620 --> 01:39:58,140
Mo...

1908
01:39:58,700 --> 01:39:59,220
The

1909
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,200
guy that has the sharp teeth.

1910
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:07,960
He's so cute.

1911
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:09,840
The Zorak.

1912
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:10,440
What's the guy?

1913
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:12,860
Not the guy in the suit.

1914
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:13,500
Brak?

1915
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:15,900
Motar is cool, though.

1916
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:19,300
Yes!

1917
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:21,520
He's so cute!

1918
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:25,320
Why do you already have diamonds?

1919
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:28,940
Let's just say...

1920
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:31,780
a certain developer...

1921
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:33,440
gifted me.

1922
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:37,900
Let's just say...

1923
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:43,160
the odds are in my favor.

1924
01:40:51,650 --> 01:40:52,990
Let's just say...

1925
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:54,830
my dad works at Mojang.

1926
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:56,010
Okay.

1927
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:16,760
We're gonna have to mix...

1928
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:18,080
and match, baby.

1929
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,440
This is the first store.

1930
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:22,580
It's very small.

1931
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:26,300
But that's because we only have, like...

1932
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:27,640
one person working here.

1933
01:41:30,740 --> 01:41:31,220
But...

1934
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:34,420
Um...

1935
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:36,320
Oh, we have lots of spruuuce!

1936
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:39,000
We have so much spruce.

1937
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:40,160
But I have an idea for this.

1938
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:40,660
Watch, watch.

1939
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:41,820
Watch how cute this is gonna be.

1940
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:43,940
Where's my shovel?

1941
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:49,680
Ah,

1942
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:57,960
it broke.

1943
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:00,680
Um...

1944
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:02,280
What you call me?

1945
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:03,420
Look.

1946
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:06,200
I may be having hard times, but...

1947
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:09,200
just flat out saying I broke is really...

1948
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:09,760
little...

1949
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:14,780
Like, I get out my situation okay.

1950
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:20,480
They told me on Twitter to stop buying candles, but i just...

1951
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:21,240
They told me on Twitter to stop buying candles,

1952
01:42:41,930 --> 01:42:44,810
See it's already shaping up really well, right?

1953
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:47,030
And then it's going to be a double door here.

1954
01:42:51,090 --> 01:42:53,570
Made of a mysterious wood.

1955
01:42:56,910 --> 01:42:57,350
Door.

1956
01:42:57,950 --> 01:43:00,870
Made of... No, I don't want spruce.

1957
01:43:00,970 --> 01:43:03,430
I want them to be able to see in and see what they're missing out on.

1958
01:43:04,230 --> 01:43:05,370
Made of a jungle.

1959
01:43:08,490 --> 01:43:08,930
Yes.

1960
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:16,650
They're eating Mike Tyson's eyes!

1961
01:43:17,450 --> 01:43:17,890
No!

1962
01:43:19,190 --> 01:43:20,430
Thank you for the five gifted.

1963
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:21,170
Thank you!

1964
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:29,780
Are you guys seeing the vision?

1965
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:33,800
You guys are seeing the vision.

1966
01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:34,760
I know it.

1967
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:37,800
Oops.

1968
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:41,040
Actually, this is where we keep...

1969
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:43,680
This is where we keep our money.

1970
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:08,440
What is that emoji?

1971
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:12,460
What was that person's face?

1972
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:18,770
Thank you.

1973
01:44:18,850 --> 01:44:20,070
Real Yago.

1974
01:44:22,210 --> 01:44:23,290
Very real.

1975
01:44:23,470 --> 01:44:24,030
Thank you.

1976
01:44:26,770 --> 01:44:27,990
Bat chest?

1977
01:44:28,650 --> 01:44:29,550
What is that?

1978
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:35,900
It's a Twitch emote?

1979
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:36,780
Oh.

1980
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:43,770
Now we have lots of glass.

1981
01:44:50,830 --> 01:44:52,830
Who... What's the emote?

1982
01:44:52,830 --> 01:44:52,910
Oh.

1983
01:44:52,910 --> 01:44:53,350
Wait.

1984
01:44:53,550 --> 01:44:54,110
Bat.

1985
01:44:54,670 --> 01:44:55,590
Bat chest.

1986
01:44:57,010 --> 01:44:58,270
Bat chest.

1987
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:02,530
Who is that?

1988
01:45:04,670 --> 01:45:08,120
Who is that?

1989
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:14,420
A

1990
01:45:19,150 --> 01:45:19,850
legend.

1991
01:45:22,210 --> 01:45:23,530
There's too many legends.

1992
01:45:25,350 --> 01:45:26,190
You know?

1993
01:45:26,190 --> 01:45:29,030
You can't call everybody a legend.

1994
01:45:29,150 --> 01:45:30,530
Because then nobody is a legend.

1995
01:45:34,770 --> 01:45:36,650
You can't call everybody a legend.

1996
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:37,130
You guys.

1997
01:45:38,330 --> 01:45:39,910
There's only one legend.

1998
01:45:40,510 --> 01:45:41,050
No.

1999
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:48,850
If you could only have one legend.

2000
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:50,110
Who are you picking?

2001
01:45:53,650 --> 01:45:54,730
Turtle chirps?

2002
01:45:55,150 --> 01:45:56,170
Since when do turtles chirp?

2003
01:45:56,190 --> 01:45:56,950
Turtles make noise.

2004
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:03,170
Mint phantom.

2005
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:08,540
I'm a legend.

2006
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:11,160
Minecraft.

2007
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:12,900
Steve.

2008
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:18,460
You're the big legend.

2009
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:20,640
I can only...

2010
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:22,740
The world doesn't need any more legends.

2011
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:25,220
Is Mint a skinny legend?

2012
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:26,600
Ha ha ha.

2013
01:46:26,620 --> 01:46:27,140
Ha ha ha.

2014
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:29,660
Possibly.

2015
01:46:31,380 --> 01:46:32,000
Um.

2016
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:34,040
We're not open yet, sir.

2017
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:36,640
You guys.

2018
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:39,180
This town was craving a maid cafe.

2019
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:42,420
They're foaming at the mouth for this place.

2020
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:44,860
They're ready to be served.

2021
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:47,160
They're

2022
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:51,400
ready to be served.

2023
01:46:51,700 --> 01:46:53,240
Maybe we should have a turtle.

2024
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:54,860
Oops.

2025
01:46:54,980 --> 01:46:55,800
Uh oh.

2026
01:46:57,340 --> 01:47:00,060
We might have to do an open air concept.

2027
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:02,820
Oh, I have one here too.

2028
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:09,000
I'm ready to serve.

2029
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:12,680
Master.

2030
01:47:13,620 --> 01:47:14,180
Oh.

2031
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:19,420
A glass roof?

2032
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,720
Good idea.

2033
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:22,460
Good idea.

2034
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:22,920
Good idea.

2035
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:25,860
Okay.

2036
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:26,160
Okay.

2037
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:27,880
You guys see the vision?

2038
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:32,280
What are you serving?

2039
01:47:41,850 --> 01:47:43,230
A knuckle sandwich.

2040
01:47:45,190 --> 01:47:45,790
Whoopah!

2041
01:47:46,090 --> 01:47:46,370
I

2042
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:03,180
thought I had more stuff.

2043
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:05,880
Serve turtles.

2044
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:08,180
What do you think we're...

2045
01:48:09,580 --> 01:48:10,180
Inhumane?

2046
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,220
Imagine a bank run by maids.

2047
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:25,620
Call it a paid cafe.

2048
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,640
More like...

2049
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:31,040
More like...

2050
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:31,440
More like you're...

2051
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:33,380
They take your money.

2052
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:35,160
Cafe.

2053
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:37,120
Sorry.

2054
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:38,860
I don't know where I was going with that one.

2055
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:43,020
Very intuitive.

2056
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:45,980
Cool.

2057
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:46,440
Cool.

2058
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:48,000
Thank you.

2059
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:52,180
Thank you.

2060
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:52,880
Thank you.

2061
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:53,400
Thank you.

2062
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:56,600
Thank you.

2063
01:48:56,820 --> 01:48:57,220
Thank you.

2064
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,440
Why do you guys watch me?

2065
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:09,100
Why do you guys watch me?

2066
01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:10,820
Oh, my shaders.

2067
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:23,940
Oh no!

2068
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:26,160
Please, sir.

2069
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:28,860
Please, you gotta help me.

2070
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:29,860
Sir.

2071
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:32,700
I heard you leave.

2072
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:39,880
Oh, my gosh.

2073
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:40,340
Oh, my gosh.

2074
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:41,860
This place needs me.

2075
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:43,980
I wonder that myself.

2076
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:48,100
I wonder that every single day of my afterlife.

2077
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:52,300
I wonder every single day.

2078
01:49:57,420 --> 01:49:59,220
Fire, fire, light the fire.

2079
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:00,860
Precisely for this.

2080
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:04,280
Does it make you...

2081
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:06,220
Does it build your confidence a little bit?

2082
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:07,200
Or are you just like, gosh.

2083
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:10,020
How dumb is that, girl?

2084
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:14,280
Can we make the Rainforest Cafe?

2085
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:16,060
Can we make the Rainforest Cafe?

2086
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:16,700
I mean...

2087
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:18,740
It's a maid cafe.

2088
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:20,960
It can be any theme that we like it to be.

2089
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:23,160
What are you doing out here?

2090
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:23,940
This is the jungle.

2091
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:26,380
This is...

2092
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:27,100
What are you talking...

2093
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:28,100
This is the Russian jungle.

2094
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:28,900
Get out of here.

2095
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:32,160
You're gonna die.

2096
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:38,160
Did I get these places?

2097
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:38,600
Did I get these places?

2098
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:41,660
I can't remember what I've robbed and what I haven't.

2099
01:50:43,820 --> 01:50:44,680
Oh, my God.

2100
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:47,340
This is useless out here.

2101
01:50:48,660 --> 01:50:51,260
Living off the land, not paying his taxes.

2102
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:54,320
Not even with a job.

2103
01:50:59,540 --> 01:51:01,180
Make it a rainforest theme.

2104
01:51:01,340 --> 01:51:01,780
Okay.

2105
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:06,420
Get rid of him.

2106
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:08,360
Where is he?

2107
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:10,700
Where did he go?

2108
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:13,800
Oh, a cat.

2109
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:16,860
Where did he go?

2110
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:18,000
What?

2111
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:20,400
Where did he go?

2112
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:22,480
I feel called out?

2113
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:23,940
No, you're perfectly fine.

2114
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:26,760
Cause you're...

2115
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:27,180
Oh, oh.

2116
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:38,820
If a tree falls in a forest and no one's around, Does it make a sound?

2117
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:42,940
Does it make a sound?

2118
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:44,180
Does it make a sound?

2119
01:51:44,180 --> 01:51:44,340
Does it make a sound?

2120
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:45,820
Like how he's getting mad at me?

2121
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:47,840
He can't get mad at me.

2122
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:50,400
You have no job!

2123
01:52:07,410 --> 01:52:08,430
You guys, he...

2124
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:09,430
We have to...

2125
01:52:10,070 --> 01:52:13,450
Actually, maybe we could've hired him at the maid cafe.

2126
01:52:18,590 --> 01:52:19,770
Maybe we should've...

2127
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:21,410
Maybe we could've hired him at the maid cafe.

2128
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:31,880
Maybe we should've...

2129
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:33,860
You killed a potential customer or employee.

2130
01:52:34,460 --> 01:52:34,480
You killed a potential customer or employee.

2131
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:37,160
Make babies!

2132
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:37,800
Make babies!

2133
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:39,460
Make babies!

2134
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:42,240
Where do you...

2135
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:42,760
Good!

2136
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:46,020
They already have a baby.

2137
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:47,580
No?

2138
01:52:48,610 --> 01:52:49,640
What do you mean you disagree?

2139
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:51,820
With bread?

2140
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:52,980
Take it.

2141
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:54,820
Alright.

2142
01:52:56,580 --> 01:52:57,720
Make babies!

2143
01:52:58,060 --> 01:52:59,060
Here we go.

2144
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:00,860
Oh yes!

2145
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:01,580
Oh my god!

2146
01:53:02,610 --> 01:53:04,240
Make babies!

2147
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:04,760
Make babies!

2148
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:05,640
Make babies!

2149
01:53:08,900 --> 01:53:09,720
Make babies!

2150
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:10,240
Make babies!

2151
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:10,820
Make babies!

2152
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:14,240
I need more customers!

2153
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:23,800
Why won't you populate?

2154
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:27,480
This guy is so stupid.

2155
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,040
No, make baby.

2156
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:32,020
Make baby.

2157
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:35,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2158
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:44,160
Bread.

2159
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:44,600
Bread.

2160
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:45,000
Bread.

2161
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:45,400
Bread.

2162
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:45,740
Bread.

2163
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:51,380
Oh my god.

2164
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:56,020
Oh my god.

2165
01:53:57,060 --> 01:53:57,620
Oh my god!

2166
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:01,200
It's happening.

2167
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:02,580
It's happening.

2168
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:05,340
It's happening!

2169
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:07,420
Where is...

2170
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:07,640
Ah!

2171
01:54:23,870 --> 01:54:25,870
Wait, there's more trapped people.

2172
01:54:26,110 --> 01:54:27,910
How many people are trapped in these things?

2173
01:54:29,850 --> 01:54:30,690
Be free.

2174
01:54:32,130 --> 01:54:32,890
There you go.

2175
01:54:33,690 --> 01:54:35,830
Wait, this village is actually popping off.

2176
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:40,170
I'm into the voyeur.

2177
01:54:41,110 --> 01:54:41,950
Don't do it.

2178
01:54:42,750 --> 01:54:43,630
Don't do it.

2179
01:54:43,670 --> 01:54:44,770
I only have 25.

2180
01:54:45,790 --> 01:54:47,530
I can't repair you every time.

2181
01:54:47,530 --> 01:54:47,790
Fine.

2182
01:54:48,350 --> 01:54:49,130
There you go.

2183
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:52,650
Let's see.

2184
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:53,610
This guy too.

2185
01:54:56,850 --> 01:54:57,710
And the cat.

2186
01:55:03,450 --> 01:55:04,010
Okay.

2187
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:07,110
This is your first time playing Minecraft?

2188
01:55:07,390 --> 01:55:12,430
Well, technically, it's like my first time playing the normal Minecraft.

2189
01:55:12,750 --> 01:55:13,370
You know what I'm saying?

2190
01:55:14,970 --> 01:55:15,830
Oh my gosh.

2191
01:55:17,210 --> 01:55:17,770
What?

2192
01:55:18,410 --> 01:55:20,470
This baby took my bed.

2193
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:27,540
How dare.

2194
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:31,880
You're working for me.

2195
01:55:32,740 --> 01:55:33,200
Hold on.

2196
01:55:33,420 --> 01:55:33,960
Hold on.

2197
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:34,340
Okay.

2198
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:34,640
Hold on.

2199
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:36,880
No, no, no.

2200
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:37,240
Come back.

2201
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:48,030
Uh-oh.

2202
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:48,350
Wait.

2203
01:55:48,410 --> 01:55:49,210
That's gonna catch on fire.

2204
01:55:51,170 --> 01:55:51,670
Maybe not.

2205
01:55:51,710 --> 01:55:51,870
Oh.

2206
01:55:58,430 --> 01:56:00,070
I don't have a way to break this.

2207
01:56:01,210 --> 01:56:02,330
How did they get out?

2208
01:56:08,010 --> 01:56:09,690
I don't think I have a way to break.

2209
01:56:20,110 --> 01:56:20,430
Wait.

2210
01:56:22,910 --> 01:56:23,230
Wait.

2211
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:27,470
Okay.

2212
01:56:27,530 --> 01:56:27,870
Hold on.

2213
01:56:29,010 --> 01:56:29,650
Get in there.

2214
01:56:29,870 --> 01:56:30,490
Get in there.

2215
01:56:31,430 --> 01:56:31,750
Yes.

2216
01:56:33,210 --> 01:56:33,950
No, no, no, no.

2217
01:56:34,750 --> 01:56:36,070
Kid, kid, kid, kid, kid.

2218
01:56:41,470 --> 01:56:45,190
Oh, he'll be back.

2219
01:56:45,630 --> 01:56:46,750
He'll be back, Lemon.

2220
01:56:47,790 --> 01:56:49,210
You'll be back.

2221
01:56:50,650 --> 01:56:51,210
Okay.

2222
01:56:51,450 --> 01:56:54,030
We don't have time to worry about this kid right now, though.

2223
01:56:54,470 --> 01:56:56,250
We have a main cafe to build.

2224
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:05,640
He's wary of my ways?

2225
01:57:07,420 --> 01:57:07,980
No.

2226
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:10,220
No.

2227
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:13,690
He's familiar with this island.

2228
01:57:13,710 --> 01:57:15,490
I want him to work for me.

2229
01:57:18,010 --> 01:57:19,430
He's an orphan.

2230
01:57:19,750 --> 01:57:21,790
His parents are dead, probably.

2231
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:34,290
No joke, you just made my mantis egg hatch.

2232
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:42,940
What did I... Am I a mom?

2233
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:44,380
What did I... Huh?

2234
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:47,260
How did I... How did that happen?

2235
01:57:49,570 --> 01:57:50,050
Huh?

2236
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:52,850
Is that a euphemism?

2237
01:57:52,870 --> 01:57:53,490
I don't...

2238
01:57:54,570 --> 01:57:55,630
I don't know.

2239
01:57:57,110 --> 01:57:57,710
Huh?

2240
01:58:01,610 --> 01:58:02,650
Am I a mom?

2241
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:10,680
Oh, he's a cartographer now.

2242
01:58:10,780 --> 01:58:11,640
He's working right here.

2243
01:58:16,990 --> 01:58:17,590
Okay.

2244
01:58:19,910 --> 01:58:24,210
We might have to have a glass roof.

2245
01:58:24,530 --> 01:58:27,710
And not in like the... you know...

2246
01:58:29,130 --> 01:58:31,370
Break the glass ceiling kind of way.

2247
01:58:31,550 --> 01:58:33,110
But I'm gonna put pumpkins on each of them.

2248
01:58:33,130 --> 01:58:33,430
On each corner.

2249
01:58:34,010 --> 01:58:35,570
For a little bit of flair.

2250
01:58:38,450 --> 01:58:39,950
In our... In our...

2251
01:58:43,740 --> 01:58:45,020
In our...

2252
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:48,920
Rainforest-made cafe.

2253
01:58:50,940 --> 01:58:51,580
Mother!

2254
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:58,520
He posted literal praying mantis eggs.

2255
01:58:58,740 --> 01:59:02,100
He is being as literal as it is possible to be.

2256
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:05,960
But what did I do to cause this?

2257
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:08,480
Was it my charm?

2258
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:11,200
Did they say like... Oh my god.

2259
01:59:12,060 --> 01:59:15,620
Who is this sweet, angelic voice we hear?

2260
01:59:16,040 --> 01:59:20,400
We must be born so we can identify the cause...

2261
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:22,980
Of this.

2262
01:59:28,830 --> 01:59:29,430
Yes.

2263
01:59:31,410 --> 01:59:34,070
You have that fertile aura...

2264
01:59:34,070 --> 01:59:35,170
Let's not say it like that.

2265
01:59:38,330 --> 01:59:39,670
I am not Chihuahua.

2266
01:59:39,690 --> 01:59:40,210
I am Fuwawa.

2267
01:59:40,370 --> 01:59:41,010
I am not Fuwawa.

2268
01:59:41,090 --> 01:59:41,630
I am Mokuko.

2269
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:42,590
Together we are...

2270
01:59:43,130 --> 01:59:43,570
Fuwamokowawa.

2271
02:00:01,510 --> 02:00:02,370
Don't push me.

2272
02:00:02,490 --> 02:00:03,730
This is my house.

2273
02:00:11,820 --> 02:00:12,920
What happened to you?

2274
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:13,400
Again.

2275
02:00:17,260 --> 02:00:18,960
Why is nobody visiting yet?

2276
02:00:22,020 --> 02:00:23,460
Why is nobody visiting yet?

2277
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:24,320
Oh.

2278
02:00:24,380 --> 02:00:25,860
Well, we don't have any tables or anything.

2279
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:28,320
It's okay.

2280
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:29,420
We'll have it soon.

2281
02:00:29,540 --> 02:00:30,080
We'll have it soon.

2282
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,440
No worries.

2283
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:36,600
There are no maids.

2284
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:37,260
Not yet.

2285
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:38,960
Not with that attitude.

2286
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:41,600
Am I nothing to you?

2287
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:44,300
Am I not a maid?

2288
02:00:47,770 --> 02:00:49,070
Am I nothing to you?

2289
02:00:49,410 --> 02:00:50,370
I'm right here.

2290
02:00:51,050 --> 02:00:51,490
I'm right here.

2291
02:00:55,170 --> 02:00:55,610
I'm right here.

2292
02:00:55,610 --> 02:00:55,950
I'm right here.

2293
02:00:55,950 --> 02:00:56,190
I'm right here.

2294
02:00:56,230 --> 02:00:57,190
And they will come.

2295
02:00:58,190 --> 02:00:58,670
Okay.

2296
02:01:00,410 --> 02:01:02,850
Thank you for your wise wisdoms.

2297
02:01:04,950 --> 02:01:07,010
You're the only maid I want, man.

2298
02:01:09,670 --> 02:01:10,630
Stop it.

2299
02:01:16,150 --> 02:01:17,030
Stop it.

2300
02:01:37,590 --> 02:01:40,710
I'm just gonna take these back if you're not gonna use them, you know?

2301
02:01:41,790 --> 02:01:44,530
I'm just gonna take those back if you're not gonna use them.

2302
02:01:48,700 --> 02:01:51,020
What will you serve in the cafe?

2303
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:52,560
Good question.

2304
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:59,120
Might I interest you in salmon?

2305
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:02,960
Freshest in the sea?

2306
02:02:03,580 --> 02:02:05,460
Or perhaps...

2307
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:09,320
Perhaps...

2308
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:18,380
Priest.

2309
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:20,360
Just a little priest.

2310
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:21,540
Oh.

2311
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:22,120
Oh.

2312
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:22,940
I almost fell through.

2313
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:23,960
Oh.

2314
02:02:27,590 --> 02:02:28,770
Don't say it.

2315
02:02:32,170 --> 02:02:33,370
Don't say it.

2316
02:02:34,110 --> 02:02:35,290
Please not him.

2317
02:02:35,470 --> 02:02:36,250
He's too gummy.

2318
02:02:37,390 --> 02:02:38,730
He's a gummy kid.

2319
02:02:39,810 --> 02:02:45,510
Start up an armory so you can have plenty of armaments.

2320
02:02:58,860 --> 02:03:00,380
She's gonna serve humans.

2321
02:03:00,940 --> 02:03:02,120
Yeah, I am.

2322
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:05,240
I'm serving them as my masters.

2323
02:03:06,360 --> 02:03:07,000
Duh.

2324
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:07,540
I'm serving them as my masters.

2325
02:03:07,540 --> 02:03:07,640
Duh.

2326
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:11,160
Duh.

2327
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:12,600
Wow.

2328
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:13,520
Oh my gosh.

2329
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:20,180
Now I can watch how the goings-on in the maid cafe are from above.

2330
02:03:24,090 --> 02:03:26,490
Kiwawa and Hennyeo were both serving something recently.

2331
02:03:26,710 --> 02:03:28,110
I won't say it.

2332
02:03:28,230 --> 02:03:29,930
You can't make me.

2333
02:03:31,050 --> 02:03:33,550
You can't make me say it.

2334
02:03:33,710 --> 02:03:34,970
You can't.

2335
02:03:35,070 --> 02:03:36,530
I won't.

2336
02:03:36,650 --> 02:03:39,010
You won't catch me saying it.

2337
02:03:39,030 --> 02:03:39,470
I'm trying it.

2338
02:03:42,550 --> 02:03:44,370
You won't catch me!

2339
02:03:48,610 --> 02:03:50,430
But it's okay if my Oshis say it.

2340
02:03:50,530 --> 02:03:51,330
Just not me.

2341
02:03:53,690 --> 02:03:55,630
My Oshis can say whatever they want.

2342
02:03:55,850 --> 02:03:57,650
Oh wait, how do we...

2343
02:03:57,650 --> 02:03:59,070
Oh we need to get some clay, right?

2344
02:03:59,830 --> 02:04:02,410
For our sherd.

2345
02:04:03,930 --> 02:04:04,450
Oh...

2346
02:04:07,370 --> 02:04:09,570
Surely, there is some down here.

2347
02:04:16,910 --> 02:04:19,090
Oshis are without flaw or blame.

2348
02:04:19,710 --> 02:04:20,690
Exactly, exactly.

2349
02:04:21,530 --> 02:04:23,310
That's why it's okay if they say it.

2350
02:04:30,030 --> 02:04:31,250
Do we get a V here?

2351
02:04:31,510 --> 02:04:35,350
As a woman, I finally saved the last five dollars for my rent.

2352
02:04:35,630 --> 02:04:37,470
Now I can not get kicked out...

2353
02:04:37,470 --> 02:04:37,830
Stop!

2354
02:04:41,050 --> 02:04:42,470
Don't send it to me then!

2355
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:49,040
My cunt is sad now.

2356
02:04:50,540 --> 02:04:51,020
Who?

2357
02:04:57,060 --> 02:04:59,460
Why are you talking in third person like a weirdo?

2358
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:00,560
Wait, is it this one?

2359
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:05,800
What?

2360
02:05:08,380 --> 02:05:09,180
You know Mike?

2361
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:37,640
Some things...

2362
02:05:44,530 --> 02:05:49,430
Some things are just really hard to remember.

2363
02:05:50,790 --> 02:05:55,150
But sometimes as a streamer, there are things that you must remember.

2364
02:05:56,790 --> 02:05:58,110
And I fell...

2365
02:05:58,110 --> 02:06:00,010
I broke that rule.

2366
02:06:01,610 --> 02:06:02,250
My

2367
02:06:25,700 --> 02:06:27,260
man Mike is important to me.

2368
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:28,540
I'd never forget about him.

2369
02:06:33,490 --> 02:06:35,410
That guy ruined my life.

2370
02:06:36,550 --> 02:06:38,350
My afterlife even.

2371
02:06:42,260 --> 02:06:44,200
Oh, I think I'm...

2372
02:06:47,890 --> 02:06:48,940
Oh god!

2373
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:49,480
Oh no!

2374
02:07:13,020 --> 02:07:15,650
I died because of my cunt!

2375
02:07:19,230 --> 02:07:20,990
It's all your fault!

2376
02:07:22,190 --> 02:07:22,590
Mike!

2377
02:07:27,880 --> 02:07:29,400
Why would you do this to me?

2378
02:07:46,810 --> 02:07:47,610
You!

2379
02:07:48,070 --> 02:07:49,430
Oh my...

2380
02:07:49,430 --> 02:07:51,110
The vape cafe!

2381
02:07:52,690 --> 02:07:55,350
Wait, they just disappeared.

2382
02:07:55,510 --> 02:07:55,890
What happened?

2383
02:07:56,070 --> 02:07:56,630
Oh, here they are.

2384
02:07:56,890 --> 02:07:57,250
You!

2385
02:07:57,410 --> 02:07:58,970
Where were you?

2386
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:02,890
It's literally your job.

2387
02:08:02,890 --> 02:08:04,990
I cannot believe I did it just in time.

2388
02:08:05,130 --> 02:08:06,190
Okay, RiseKnight.

2389
02:08:06,350 --> 02:08:06,830
Okay.

2390
02:08:06,890 --> 02:08:07,770
Okay, right.

2391
02:08:07,950 --> 02:08:08,810
Okay, RiseKnight.

2392
02:08:08,990 --> 02:08:09,470
Okay.

2393
02:08:10,010 --> 02:08:11,550
I can't believe you!

2394
02:08:11,570 --> 02:08:12,670
Where were you?

2395
02:08:14,990 --> 02:08:15,470
Oh...

2396
02:08:15,470 --> 02:08:16,410
Ah...

2397
02:08:20,690 --> 02:08:22,350
I heard them coming!

2398
02:08:22,530 --> 02:08:23,430
I heard them coming!

2399
02:08:25,890 --> 02:08:28,690
I was just about to get in the shower and I heard the screams.

2400
02:08:28,790 --> 02:08:30,190
I just want to say rip Bozo.

2401
02:08:31,450 --> 02:08:31,930
Wow!

2402
02:08:31,930 --> 02:08:35,530
Wow, look how beautiful it was down here.

2403
02:08:35,710 --> 02:08:35,870
Woah!

2404
02:08:37,730 --> 02:08:38,290
Diamond?

2405
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:45,860
Mods ban that man.

2406
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:48,360
Where are you?

2407
02:08:48,540 --> 02:08:49,360
Who was it?

2408
02:08:49,420 --> 02:08:51,160
It was Customer Johnson, wasn't it you?

2409
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:53,280
That sent me about Mike?

2410
02:08:54,300 --> 02:08:54,860
Right?

2411
02:08:56,380 --> 02:08:58,460
I can't believe Mint died of ligma.

2412
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:03,840
Shut the hell out Lily, please.

2413
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:05,480
Shut up.

2414
02:09:05,980 --> 02:09:06,540
Oh!

2415
02:09:13,060 --> 02:09:14,140
We're in... oh!

2416
02:09:14,980 --> 02:09:15,540
Oh!

2417
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:17,100
I don't know!

2418
02:09:17,380 --> 02:09:18,460
What's going on?

2419
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:20,000
Ow!

2420
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:22,260
What's that over there?

2421
02:09:22,580 --> 02:09:23,980
I think I see the light.

2422
02:09:26,120 --> 02:09:28,100
No, this is the village!

2423
02:09:28,460 --> 02:09:28,920
I died!

2424
02:09:37,290 --> 02:09:39,330
Hardcore mode is suffering.

2425
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:46,420
What's that down there?

2426
02:09:46,740 --> 02:09:48,340
I wonder if we can find something interesting.

2427
02:09:51,780 --> 02:09:53,360
Oh, it just looks so square.

2428
02:09:53,420 --> 02:09:54,740
I thought it was like...

2429
02:09:54,740 --> 02:09:57,020
The world... oh, we're back.

2430
02:09:57,940 --> 02:09:59,480
Oh, we're back.

2431
02:10:00,300 --> 02:10:01,600
We're gone and we're back.

2432
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:03,480
You are a specimen.

2433
02:10:05,340 --> 02:10:06,640
What does that mean?

2434
02:10:06,940 --> 02:10:08,260
What does that even mean?

2435
02:10:08,420 --> 02:10:09,340
That is so rude!

2436
02:10:11,740 --> 02:10:13,500
I'm more than a specimen!

2437
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:16,360
Literal, actual, god...

2438
02:10:17,660 --> 02:10:19,520
Stop laughing at me!

2439
02:10:20,900 --> 02:10:22,260
I'm going to...

2440
02:10:22,260 --> 02:10:23,420
What happened?

2441
02:10:23,480 --> 02:10:24,380
Why suddenly creative?

2442
02:10:25,420 --> 02:10:26,060
Nothing.

2443
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:29,680
I got bored of playing the game for real.

2444
02:10:40,100 --> 02:10:41,340
Well, everybody...

2445
02:10:45,700 --> 02:10:47,380
I wonder if it will let me do this.

2446
02:10:48,860 --> 02:10:49,820
Stop pausing!

2447
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:03,680
It had to be done.

2448
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:04,620
Did it?

2449
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:07,380
Did it, customer support?

2450
02:11:08,080 --> 02:11:08,560
Customer...

2451
02:11:10,140 --> 02:11:10,620
Sorry.

2452
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:16,840
You know, usually when you say customer support...

2453
02:11:16,840 --> 02:11:17,280
I mean...

2454
02:11:18,420 --> 02:11:18,900
Sorry.

2455
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:24,960
Sorry.

2456
02:11:41,740 --> 02:11:43,640
You know, in the end, I can't do it anymore.

2457
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:43,760
Now I'm trying to think of a way to make it easier for you.

2458
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:47,860
Oh, no!

2459
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:50,360
No, you can't.

2460
02:11:50,680 --> 02:11:52,620
I'm the one who's the one who's scared...

2461
02:11:52,620 --> 02:11:54,280
Yeah, yeah, you can just stop laughing at me.

2462
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:58,060
I know what you're going to say.

2463
02:11:58,060 --> 02:12:00,300
First or second, uh, thank you.

2464
02:12:01,560 --> 02:12:02,080
Okay.

2465
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:07,040
Um, wait, back to game.

2466
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:09,600
I'm going now!

2467
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:15,340
But every time I click out of Minecraft, it puts up the...

2468
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:17,460
It does that, so it doesn't, um...

2469
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:19,020
I can't really zoom out.

2470
02:12:24,220 --> 02:12:28,400
Your comedic typing is so perfect that an outsider would think it's a crimson.

2471
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:29,460
What do you mean?

2472
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:32,800
What is that?

2473
02:12:33,240 --> 02:12:34,760
Wait, what is that up there?

2474
02:12:34,860 --> 02:12:35,320
Do you see that?

2475
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:37,660
Wait, what is that in the sky?

2476
02:12:39,980 --> 02:12:40,740
What is that?

2477
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:45,600
Oh my god, it's the village!

2478
02:12:50,120 --> 02:12:51,100
It's the village.

2479
02:12:56,550 --> 02:12:58,350
I keep seeing these things...

2480
02:13:00,230 --> 02:13:02,730
I'm actually crying, you guys.

2481
02:13:03,750 --> 02:13:07,970
This isn't funny anymore and I'm tiny and I can't get big.

2482
02:13:09,150 --> 02:13:11,470
I'm small and the world is...

2483
02:13:11,470 --> 02:13:12,670
See, this is what I'm seeing.

2484
02:13:14,170 --> 02:13:15,650
Help me, please!

2485
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:28,200
This is like, uh...

2486
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:30,120
Like, mosquito simulator.

2487
02:13:30,120 --> 02:13:32,180
What if I just keep going forever?

2488
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:32,980
Hold on.

2489
02:13:33,460 --> 02:13:34,340
This way.

2490
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:39,720
I'm dying now.

2491
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:42,860
I'm dying.

2492
02:13:43,400 --> 02:13:44,860
Well, I'm already dead.

2493
02:13:45,100 --> 02:13:45,900
I'm dead.

2494
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:49,180
I'm going back to heaven.

2495
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:52,900
Because of my cunt.

2496
02:13:55,380 --> 02:13:56,480
Thank you.

2497
02:13:57,260 --> 02:14:01,100
For joining me on this afterlife journey.

2498
02:14:05,060 --> 02:14:06,600
Don't fall for...

2499
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:10,500
Don't fall for the name.

2500
02:14:15,880 --> 02:14:17,900
See you in another four years, Mitt.

2501
02:14:19,880 --> 02:14:20,740
Where are we?

2502
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:22,400
Still in the void.

2503
02:14:22,580 --> 02:14:22,760
Okay.

2504
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:27,440
It's nice and bright up here.

2505
02:14:28,420 --> 02:14:29,560
I'm basically toasting.

2506
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:30,200
I'm toasting.

2507
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:32,560
I'm frying.

2508
02:14:32,740 --> 02:14:33,480
I'm sizzling.

2509
02:14:34,580 --> 02:14:36,080
Don't go into the light.

2510
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:40,400
I am the light.

2511
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:53,800
I will be a guiding light in your sad lives so that you never say bad things again.

2512
02:14:59,720 --> 02:15:01,040
I wonder where we are.

2513
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:02,640
Like actually.

2514
02:15:02,840 --> 02:15:03,820
I wonder if it will load.

2515
02:15:05,020 --> 02:15:06,940
Aren't you supposed to spectate the world?

2516
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:09,900
I guess it's gone.

2517
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:16,620
Praise the sun.

2518
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:20,660
Praise the sun!

2519
02:15:22,760 --> 02:15:25,100
Doesn't work properly on Java edition yet.

2520
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:26,120
Anyway.

2521
02:15:43,120 --> 02:15:45,440
That was silly, wasn't it?

2522
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:49,360
That was pretty goofy, wasn't it?

2523
02:15:51,400 --> 02:15:53,080
Give pies lots of pets.

2524
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:54,480
Osumito.

2525
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:55,960
No, no, no, no, no.

2526
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:57,780
Let's make another world.

2527
02:15:57,840 --> 02:15:58,780
It doesn't have to be hardcore.

2528
02:15:59,120 --> 02:16:00,000
I'm so sad.

2529
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:02,360
Made world Outer Heaven Busted Z.

2530
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:06,480
We'll never be able to go back to you.

2531
02:16:06,580 --> 02:16:08,560
Made world Outer Heaven Busted Z.

2532
02:16:11,680 --> 02:16:12,240
That's so sad.

2533
02:16:29,180 --> 02:16:29,700
Next.

2534
02:16:37,010 --> 02:16:37,530
Oh!

2535
02:16:39,870 --> 02:16:41,490
It loads so fast!

2536
02:16:42,090 --> 02:16:46,210
I feel like I remember in the past, worlds used to take like a long time to load.

2537
02:16:47,170 --> 02:16:48,250
We are back!

2538
02:16:50,710 --> 02:16:53,610
This time, better than ever.

2539
02:16:57,630 --> 02:16:58,150
Savannah...

2540
02:17:00,330 --> 02:17:01,690
Oh, I forgot to do the...

2541
02:17:02,970 --> 02:17:04,330
I forgot to put hardcore.

2542
02:17:04,830 --> 02:17:06,570
You guys, I forgot to put hardcore.

2543
02:17:07,990 --> 02:17:11,870
I would like to do a server.

2544
02:17:12,510 --> 02:17:13,850
Or join a server.

2545
02:17:15,010 --> 02:17:19,770
I have talked with Henya and Mousey about maybe...

2546
02:17:19,770 --> 02:17:24,790
If they want to give me a tour of maybe the Vishojo server.

2547
02:17:25,130 --> 02:17:27,290
But it kind of scares me because...

2548
02:17:27,290 --> 02:17:28,630
Oh gosh, I'm going to die.

2549
02:17:28,750 --> 02:17:29,970
No, I'm not going to die.

2550
02:17:30,330 --> 02:17:34,330
It kind of scares me because they have so many mods.

2551
02:17:36,730 --> 02:17:38,870
So I'm a little intimidated by it.

2552
02:17:38,950 --> 02:17:39,770
But we'll see.

2553
02:17:45,310 --> 02:17:46,230
We'll see what happens.

2554
02:17:48,470 --> 02:17:50,090
Their mod pack is awesome.

2555
02:17:52,850 --> 02:17:54,950
I've only watched like...

2556
02:17:55,950 --> 02:17:57,150
Like Henya play.

2557
02:17:58,210 --> 02:18:00,930
And I was like, this doesn't even feel like Minecraft.

2558
02:18:03,370 --> 02:18:04,010
But...

2559
02:18:04,010 --> 02:18:05,370
It would be fun.

2560
02:18:05,610 --> 02:18:06,910
To try at least.

2561
02:18:07,110 --> 02:18:07,650
And...

2562
02:18:09,010 --> 02:18:11,710
I haven't entirely given up on the...

2563
02:18:12,930 --> 02:18:13,570
Server...

2564
02:18:13,570 --> 02:18:14,570
My own server...

2565
02:18:14,570 --> 02:18:15,790
For people to play.

2566
02:18:16,250 --> 02:18:17,470
I just...

2567
02:18:19,870 --> 02:18:21,970
I still just don't know...

2568
02:18:22,870 --> 02:18:24,850
What to do entirely yet.

2569
02:18:26,290 --> 02:18:27,050
Is all.

2570
02:18:28,230 --> 02:18:29,930
Make it a hardcore server.

2571
02:18:33,010 --> 02:18:35,010
That would be so intense, wouldn't it?

2572
02:18:45,460 --> 02:18:47,240
I wonder if there's any armadillos.

2573
02:18:50,900 --> 02:18:51,600
But yeah.

2574
02:18:52,360 --> 02:18:52,840
So...

2575
02:18:53,660 --> 02:18:55,640
Hopefully next time I play Minecraft...

2576
02:18:55,640 --> 02:18:56,660
I just kind of...

2577
02:18:56,660 --> 02:18:58,940
Like I said, I wanted to play something that was...

2578
02:19:00,080 --> 02:19:00,980
There's the armadillo!

2579
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:04,680
I want to play something that was a little bit more of my...

2580
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:05,480
Comfort.

2581
02:19:06,800 --> 02:19:08,060
Since I had a...

2582
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:09,440
Crazy day today.

2583
02:19:13,080 --> 02:19:15,040
Did you just start a forest fire?

2584
02:19:16,140 --> 02:19:17,300
Now I didn't.

2585
02:19:18,900 --> 02:19:21,980
No new wolves are so cute.

2586
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:25,040
They're so sweet.

2587
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:27,260
Little brown dogs.

2588
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:29,900
Little dogs.

2589
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:30,500
Little dogs.

2590
02:19:32,320 --> 02:19:33,060
But yeah.

2591
02:19:33,220 --> 02:19:33,680
Sorry.

2592
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:34,580
I'm just kind of like...

2593
02:19:34,580 --> 02:19:35,340
Running and...

2594
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:37,860
I'm afraid of this ghost.

2595
02:19:38,400 --> 02:19:39,780
You shouldn't be...

2596
02:19:40,560 --> 02:19:41,820
You shouldn't be real.

2597
02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:43,420
Oh my gosh.

2598
02:19:43,460 --> 02:19:44,800
And there's a jungle right over here.

2599
02:19:45,640 --> 02:19:46,900
Maybe we'll get a panda.

2600
02:19:46,900 --> 02:19:47,280
Maybe we'll get a panda.

2601
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:55,500
Casually sets the forest on fire.

2602
02:19:59,080 --> 02:20:00,540
No, these look the same.

2603
02:20:01,560 --> 02:20:03,200
Maybe they're a little...

2604
02:20:03,860 --> 02:20:04,880
They're a little...

2605
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:05,860
I can't tell.

2606
02:20:05,860 --> 02:20:06,600
Maybe it's the lighting.

2607
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:08,300
Are they the same as those dogs?

2608
02:20:09,080 --> 02:20:09,780
I can't tell.

2609
02:20:12,100 --> 02:20:12,660
Ouch.

2610
02:20:22,970 --> 02:20:24,670
This is how I make food sometimes.

2611
02:20:25,390 --> 02:20:26,790
In Minecraft, obviously.

2612
02:20:35,370 --> 02:20:36,330
Don't touch me.

2613
02:20:42,090 --> 02:20:43,290
Come back.

2614
02:20:43,570 --> 02:20:44,310
Come back.

2615
02:20:45,770 --> 02:20:46,970
Come back.

2616
02:20:47,590 --> 02:20:48,410
There we go.

2617
02:20:49,770 --> 02:20:50,370
See?

2618
02:20:56,530 --> 02:20:57,350
There we go.

2619
02:21:02,390 --> 02:21:03,430
Fire pig.

2620
02:21:05,110 --> 02:21:05,810
But yeah.

2621
02:21:06,170 --> 02:21:16,710
Because I'm... hopefully I will be on a server next time, whether it be my own or probably most likely somebody else's.

2622
02:21:19,430 --> 02:21:23,010
But yeah, thank you guys for joining me tonight.

2623
02:21:23,150 --> 02:21:32,550
I know it's a bit of a shorter stream, but I just wanted to kind of hang out a little bit since I did not stream yesterday for the profile picture things.

2624
02:21:37,770 --> 02:21:51,170
I realized too, I also forgot to put this up, but I will in fact, rather than having it be like, you know, pay for me to draw it, I'm going to put up like a Google form for anybody who's interested.

2625
02:21:52,390 --> 02:21:54,730
And it's going to be kind of like more lottery based.

2626
02:21:55,470 --> 02:22:02,090
So that way, you know, you don't have to be like, oh, I can't donate $100.

2627
02:22:02,550 --> 02:22:09,250
So anybody can have the chance to get a profile picture drawn.

2628
02:22:10,010 --> 02:22:12,630
And gotcha pog.

2629
02:22:12,810 --> 02:22:14,150
Yeah, but it's free gotcha.

2630
02:22:14,530 --> 02:22:15,770
It's free gotcha.

2631
02:22:16,190 --> 02:22:17,530
Because, yeah.

2632
02:22:20,870 --> 02:22:21,710
Yeah, yeah.

2633
02:22:21,830 --> 02:22:26,970
So that's what I plan to do.

2634
02:22:27,110 --> 02:22:32,530
I think I'll have the stream on Sunday since I didn't do it.

2635
02:22:32,550 --> 02:22:32,790
Sunday.

2636
02:22:35,930 --> 02:22:39,330
This time, do another Sunday.

2637
02:22:40,110 --> 02:22:42,450
But what if we want to keep throwing money at you?

2638
02:22:43,130 --> 02:22:49,350
Well, that's very generous of you, but I don't want people to feel like they are always having to throw money at me.

2639
02:22:49,790 --> 02:22:56,010
I just thought, like, I just thought, like, I don't know, I don't want to exclude anybody.

2640
02:22:58,030 --> 02:22:58,990
So, hmm.

2641
02:23:02,550 --> 02:23:02,990
Pogs.

2642
02:23:05,570 --> 02:23:06,970
No, we love it.

2643
02:23:07,010 --> 02:23:07,370
Stop!

2644
02:23:10,610 --> 02:23:12,550
So yeah, I'll do that.

2645
02:23:13,310 --> 02:23:17,930
And I wonder how fast we can get blown up by a creeper.

2646
02:23:19,130 --> 02:23:21,730
Hold on, I'm gonna, I'm gonna cut down a tree.

2647
02:23:22,010 --> 02:23:23,990
We're gonna die, we're gonna die here.

2648
02:23:24,890 --> 02:23:26,070
And we're gonna dig down.

2649
02:23:26,730 --> 02:23:29,010
I will aggressively throw money at Mint.

2650
02:23:29,170 --> 02:23:30,970
No jokes on you fans.

2651
02:23:31,150 --> 02:23:32,130
Just free for the freak out to.

2652
02:23:32,550 --> 02:23:33,070
Nooo!

2653
02:23:37,030 --> 02:23:38,490
Thank you for the 10k!

2654
02:23:38,630 --> 02:23:39,090
Thank you!

2655
02:23:39,570 --> 02:23:41,130
But seriously, seriously...

2656
02:23:42,250 --> 02:23:49,290
There will probably be quite a bunch of people that will want to participate.

2657
02:23:49,570 --> 02:23:50,610
Oh wait, we can go down here.

2658
02:23:52,350 --> 02:23:56,850
So I'll probably just do like a handful for the stream.

2659
02:23:57,190 --> 02:23:58,130
And then...

2660
02:24:02,610 --> 02:24:04,270
And then I can do it again another time.

2661
02:24:05,970 --> 02:24:07,790
When I ultimately don't get to everybody.

2662
02:24:08,510 --> 02:24:09,750
Hello, where are the...

2663
02:24:11,050 --> 02:24:12,130
Where are the bad guys?

2664
02:24:15,990 --> 02:24:16,750
I'm trapped.

2665
02:24:20,590 --> 02:24:22,030
What was this about free super time?

2666
02:24:22,110 --> 02:24:22,970
No, stop throwing what?

2667
02:24:26,890 --> 02:24:27,410
Thank you!

2668
02:24:29,410 --> 02:24:31,070
Did someone say free super?

2669
02:24:33,050 --> 02:24:33,510
No!

2670
02:24:34,210 --> 02:24:36,190
I mean, I certainly did not.

2671
02:24:36,550 --> 02:24:37,530
Wait, oh wait.

2672
02:24:37,690 --> 02:24:39,590
If I can do this...

2673
02:24:40,190 --> 02:24:40,590
Hold on.

2674
02:24:40,850 --> 02:24:41,790
I might be...

2675
02:24:42,730 --> 02:24:44,310
Thinking with portals right now.

2676
02:24:44,590 --> 02:24:46,130
I might be thinking with portals right now.

2677
02:24:48,570 --> 02:24:49,770
Oh my gosh, hold on.

2678
02:24:57,450 --> 02:24:58,590
Free, free, free.

2679
02:24:58,730 --> 02:24:59,450
Wait, hold on.

2680
02:25:03,310 --> 02:25:04,150
No way!

2681
02:25:04,470 --> 02:25:05,490
I just read it!

2682
02:25:05,530 --> 02:25:06,950
I didn't... No, please.

2683
02:25:08,810 --> 02:25:09,250
Okay.

2684
02:25:09,610 --> 02:25:10,410
We're gaming.

2685
02:25:10,550 --> 02:25:11,110
Yeah, we're gaming.

2686
02:25:11,250 --> 02:25:11,650
We're gaming.

2687
02:25:11,750 --> 02:25:12,210
We're gaming.

2688
02:25:12,790 --> 02:25:13,570
We're gaming.

2689
02:25:13,690 --> 02:25:14,050
We're gaming.

2690
02:25:14,190 --> 02:25:14,450
We're gaming.

2691
02:25:14,690 --> 02:25:15,230
Okay, here we go.

2692
02:25:16,770 --> 02:25:18,130
Time to dig down, baby!

2693
02:25:21,330 --> 02:25:22,870
Valentine, thank you for the 50.

2694
02:25:23,050 --> 02:25:24,530
Thank you!

2695
02:25:26,970 --> 02:25:28,750
Oh, we got some coal.

2696
02:25:29,810 --> 02:25:30,870
I hear a spider.

2697
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:38,420
Keep going.

2698
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:39,160
Keep going.

2699
02:25:39,260 --> 02:25:39,980
Keep going!

2700
02:25:58,600 --> 02:25:59,800
Keep going.

2701
02:25:59,880 --> 02:26:00,400
Keep going.

2702
02:26:00,440 --> 02:26:00,780
Keep going.

2703
02:26:03,700 --> 02:26:05,420
We hit a mine.

2704
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:07,240
Free.

2705
02:26:08,300 --> 02:26:09,660
Why is there a...

2706
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:11,820
Or a deep slate.

2707
02:26:11,820 --> 02:26:14,920
Why is there a emote that just says free?

2708
02:26:18,880 --> 02:26:19,440
Why is there a emote that just says free?

2709
02:26:19,440 --> 02:26:20,720
Thank you guys for the super chat.

2710
02:26:20,840 --> 02:26:21,300
Thank you.

2711
02:26:23,640 --> 02:26:27,020
I don't know why you guys are always spoiling me.

2712
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:28,080
I don't know why you guys are always spoiling me.

2713
02:26:29,180 --> 02:26:31,740
I just wanted...

2714
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:35,640
If I don't...

2715
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:40,080
I heard...

2716
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:41,360
I can't see anything.

2717
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:43,240
There's the hole!

2718
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:44,980
Can you guys see anything?

2719
02:26:46,060 --> 02:26:46,980
Do you have food?

2720
02:26:47,220 --> 02:26:48,580
No, we're here to die, baby.

2721
02:26:52,040 --> 02:26:52,960
But I hear lava.

2722
02:26:56,420 --> 02:26:57,740
You could make torches.

2723
02:26:57,980 --> 02:26:58,600
You're right!

2724
02:27:06,830 --> 02:27:07,670
You're so right.

2725
02:27:08,010 --> 02:27:08,690
There we go.

2726
02:27:09,010 --> 02:27:09,950
Now I can see.

2727
02:27:12,050 --> 02:27:13,190
Is it right here?

2728
02:27:18,550 --> 02:27:19,530
It's so dark.

2729
02:27:19,930 --> 02:27:20,330
It's so dark.

2730
02:27:20,330 --> 02:27:21,190
You guys, we're gonna die.

2731
02:27:22,750 --> 02:27:23,630
We almost did...

2732
02:27:23,630 --> 02:27:25,350
Why is there an emote that just says free?

2733
02:27:31,900 --> 02:27:32,700
Free stuff.

2734
02:27:33,720 --> 02:27:34,440
Oh my gosh.

2735
02:27:34,500 --> 02:27:37,380
Thank you for the aqua super.

2736
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:38,400
Thank you.

2737
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:42,080
Thank you so much.

2738
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:42,660
Also, wait.

2739
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:44,520
I think there was another one that I missed earlier.

2740
02:27:44,660 --> 02:27:44,900
Hold on.

2741
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:47,260
Wait, there was another aqua super I missed earlier.

2742
02:27:47,340 --> 02:27:47,780
Wasn't there?

2743
02:27:48,420 --> 02:27:48,620
Oh gosh.

2744
02:27:48,800 --> 02:27:49,360
I'm so sorry.

2745
02:27:49,620 --> 02:27:52,360
I was so distracted by the customer.

2746
02:27:53,100 --> 02:27:55,600
And the mic and everything.

2747
02:27:57,040 --> 02:27:58,140
Oh, there it is.

2748
02:27:58,240 --> 02:27:59,480
Oh no, YouTube is...

2749
02:27:59,480 --> 02:28:02,300
Oh no, YouTube is...

2750
02:28:03,480 --> 02:28:04,100
Shiori!

2751
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:06,900
A big aqua super shared between us.

2752
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:08,500
The Advent Fan Club.

2753
02:28:08,620 --> 02:28:09,120
Here you go.

2754
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:10,280
Thank you.

2755
02:28:13,460 --> 02:28:14,780
Thank you so much.

2756
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:17,800
Thank you so much.

2757
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:22,300
Advent is lucky to have good fans.

2758
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:28,240
Okay, here we go.

2759
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:30,600
She likes Mike more than us.

2760
02:28:30,700 --> 02:28:30,900
No!

2761
02:28:33,060 --> 02:28:33,960
Spooked me for a second.

2762
02:28:34,300 --> 02:28:35,120
I thought it was lava.

2763
02:28:35,380 --> 02:28:36,100
I thought we were about to die.

2764
02:28:36,920 --> 02:28:37,860
When will we die?

2765
02:28:42,780 --> 02:28:44,220
When will we die?

2766
02:28:44,600 --> 02:28:46,260
Thank you for the 50.

2767
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:50,320
Turns out the...

2768
02:28:52,180 --> 02:28:53,080
20th is free.

2769
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:54,880
Oh!

2770
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:56,220
Uh oh.

2771
02:28:57,620 --> 02:28:58,900
Wait, but I'm supposed to die.

2772
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:00,140
Uh oh.

2773
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:02,480
Uh...

2774
02:29:02,480 --> 02:29:03,560
Hold on.

2775
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:04,420
Let's dig through here.

2776
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:08,320
Into the lava beyond...

2777
02:29:10,320 --> 02:29:10,800
S...

2778
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:11,520
810!

2779
02:29:12,100 --> 02:29:13,500
Thank you for the aqua super!

2780
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:14,680
It's not free.

2781
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:15,880
It's definitely not free.

2782
02:29:19,840 --> 02:29:20,100
What?

2783
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:25,400
I just got the weirdest...

2784
02:29:26,940 --> 02:29:27,420
notification.

2785
02:29:30,480 --> 02:29:31,160
Oh, wait.

2786
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:32,320
Oh!

2787
02:29:33,320 --> 02:29:34,140
I wonder.

2788
02:29:34,220 --> 02:29:34,560
Hold on.

2789
02:29:35,660 --> 02:29:36,140
You...

2790
02:29:39,480 --> 02:29:39,960
Oh!

2791
02:29:41,440 --> 02:29:41,920
Interesting.

2792
02:29:42,620 --> 02:29:43,880
I just got a notification.

2793
02:29:44,460 --> 02:29:46,960
Okay, so this stream will probably not be monetized.

2794
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:48,880
Because it says we just got...

2795
02:29:48,880 --> 02:29:51,140
We just detected audio in your stream...

2796
02:29:51,140 --> 02:29:52,440
belonging to someone else.

2797
02:29:52,620 --> 02:29:54,320
And your stream might be blocked.

2798
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:55,220
No!

2799
02:29:55,300 --> 02:29:56,460
Don't block my stream!

2800
02:29:58,680 --> 02:29:59,320
Please.

2801
02:30:01,320 --> 02:30:01,960
YouTube!

2802
02:30:03,020 --> 02:30:04,640
I'll turn down the jazz.

2803
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:06,640
Is that what's gonna do it?

2804
02:30:07,860 --> 02:30:09,240
Not the jazz!

2805
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:14,380
Not the jazz!

2806
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:16,180
You guys, we're gonna lose her.

2807
02:30:16,480 --> 02:30:17,440
We're gonna...

2808
02:30:19,700 --> 02:30:20,420
There it is.

2809
02:30:20,440 --> 02:30:20,940
There it goes.

2810
02:30:21,140 --> 02:30:21,680
Oh, wait.

2811
02:30:21,860 --> 02:30:22,700
We can make another.

2812
02:30:23,360 --> 02:30:23,760
Okay.

2813
02:30:24,020 --> 02:30:24,960
We can make another.

2814
02:30:32,480 --> 02:30:33,200
Make another.

2815
02:30:39,630 --> 02:30:41,310
It's from when you sang Imagine.

2816
02:30:43,550 --> 02:30:45,730
Imagine all the people.

2817
02:30:49,150 --> 02:30:50,550
Valentine, thank you for the 50!

2818
02:30:52,210 --> 02:30:54,470
Okay, I think maybe we need to dig up a little bit.

2819
02:30:54,570 --> 02:30:55,590
If we're still hitting...

2820
02:30:57,870 --> 02:30:58,430
Bedrock.

2821
02:31:01,530 --> 02:31:03,170
Bring the workbench with you?

2822
02:31:03,510 --> 02:31:04,970
You're probably right.

2823
02:31:05,050 --> 02:31:07,350
How is it so hard to die in this game, you know?

2824
02:31:15,330 --> 02:31:16,450
Customer Johnson.

2825
02:31:17,490 --> 02:31:19,090
I will not make that.

2826
02:31:20,170 --> 02:31:22,930
I will not be made a fool twice.

2827
02:31:24,410 --> 02:31:26,270
I will not be made...

2828
02:31:26,270 --> 02:31:27,110
Fool me once.

2829
02:31:28,870 --> 02:31:30,130
Shame, shame, shame.

2830
02:31:30,130 --> 02:31:31,690
Shame on me.

2831
02:31:34,350 --> 02:31:35,670
Valentine, thank you for the 50!

2832
02:31:36,230 --> 02:31:37,370
Valentine, thank you for the 50!

2833
02:31:37,370 --> 02:31:38,270
Oh, I hear the lava.

2834
02:31:48,750 --> 02:31:49,530
Oh, I hear the lava.

2835
02:31:49,530 --> 02:31:49,850
This way.

2836
02:31:58,380 --> 02:31:58,900
Forward.

2837
02:32:03,480 --> 02:32:04,880
Oh, that was weird.

2838
02:32:06,620 --> 02:32:07,400
Come on.

2839
02:32:08,580 --> 02:32:09,700
Death said no.

2840
02:32:11,140 --> 02:32:13,300
It was so easy for me to die before.

2841
02:32:13,440 --> 02:32:14,360
It was so easy for me to die before.

2842
02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:17,740
I hear it.

2843
02:32:19,140 --> 02:32:20,220
Wait.

2844
02:32:20,940 --> 02:32:22,480
Did that drip?

2845
02:32:25,860 --> 02:32:26,940
No.

2846
02:32:31,100 --> 02:32:34,720
This is making me nostalgic.

2847
02:32:36,380 --> 02:32:37,780
For what?

2848
02:32:37,780 --> 02:32:38,060
But...

2849
02:32:41,960 --> 02:32:45,680
I wanted to kind of discover like a cool place, but...

2850
02:32:46,180 --> 02:32:48,560
Dying in the lava I guess is okay too, you know?

2851
02:32:48,620 --> 02:32:49,780
If I die...

2852
02:32:51,160 --> 02:32:51,880
I can't...

2853
02:32:51,880 --> 02:32:53,060
Oh, lava popping here.

2854
02:32:55,820 --> 02:32:56,940
Oh, there's a bat!

2855
02:32:57,100 --> 02:32:57,580
There's a bat!

2856
02:32:58,120 --> 02:32:59,460
Oh, the bat just burned.

2857
02:32:59,740 --> 02:33:01,140
I don't know what happened to the bat.

2858
02:33:03,560 --> 02:33:05,820
The bat just burned in the lava.

2859
02:33:05,820 --> 02:33:05,940
Lava.

2860
02:33:06,580 --> 02:33:07,700
Lava popping.

2861
02:33:08,620 --> 02:33:09,660
Wait, what?

2862
02:33:10,840 --> 02:33:12,360
Nutty putty caves?

2863
02:33:12,620 --> 02:33:12,980
No!

2864
02:33:15,480 --> 02:33:16,720
Don't say that!

2865
02:33:17,600 --> 02:33:18,320
Goodbye bat.

2866
02:33:18,640 --> 02:33:20,740
She died once, she can't die twice.

2867
02:33:22,120 --> 02:33:25,000
The lava is literally around us.

2868
02:33:30,180 --> 02:33:30,560
Please.

2869
02:33:32,540 --> 02:33:33,300
Please!

2870
02:33:34,660 --> 02:33:36,220
Where are you?

2871
02:33:48,270 --> 02:33:49,070
Where are you?

2872
02:33:49,310 --> 02:33:50,130
I tried slash kill.

2873
02:33:52,390 --> 02:33:53,870
I don't have cheats on.

2874
02:33:54,050 --> 02:33:55,950
Can you slash kill?

2875
02:34:04,320 --> 02:34:05,260
Keep digging.

2876
02:34:08,690 --> 02:34:09,610
We'll get there.

2877
02:34:10,130 --> 02:34:11,410
We'll get to an opening.

2878
02:34:12,030 --> 02:34:12,590
Please.

2879
02:34:14,150 --> 02:34:15,110
Lava popping.

2880
02:34:15,350 --> 02:34:16,350
Bats are screeching.

2881
02:34:19,210 --> 02:34:21,450
Why is it so hard to die in this game?

2882
02:34:24,830 --> 02:34:26,110
Is it a bot feed?

2883
02:34:28,550 --> 02:34:30,310
It sounds right next to me.

2884
02:34:30,910 --> 02:34:33,890
It sounds like the next block I break will be it.

2885
02:34:35,250 --> 02:34:36,150
Oh my god.

2886
02:34:46,500 --> 02:34:47,400
Where's the lava?

2887
02:34:57,180 --> 02:34:58,820
I don't want to die to a skelly.

2888
02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:01,580
I don't want to die to your dumb ass.

2889
02:35:02,360 --> 02:35:03,080
Oh, diamond.

2890
02:35:07,170 --> 02:35:09,410
At least we get diamond before we die!

2891
02:35:15,500 --> 02:35:16,340
Did it glitch?

2892
02:35:40,830 --> 02:35:41,690
What's the wrong?

2893
02:35:41,690 --> 02:35:42,210
What's the wrong axe?

2894
02:35:43,710 --> 02:35:45,390
I didn't even think about it.

2895
02:35:46,650 --> 02:35:50,510
Because I just always have like a diamond or iron.

2896
02:35:50,570 --> 02:35:52,010
At least an iron axe.

2897
02:35:52,710 --> 02:35:53,690
I just always...

2898
02:36:05,860 --> 02:36:07,080
You know what?

2899
02:36:08,080 --> 02:36:09,300
Okay, skelly man.

2900
02:36:09,440 --> 02:36:10,180
You can get me.

2901
02:36:14,490 --> 02:36:15,530
Come on.

2902
02:36:15,530 --> 02:36:16,530
Put me out of my misery.

2903
02:36:19,010 --> 02:36:20,210
Score one.

2904
02:36:20,430 --> 02:36:21,390
Mint one.

2905
02:36:21,710 --> 02:36:22,870
Skelly zero.

2906
02:36:27,940 --> 02:36:28,540
Whoa!

2907
02:36:29,400 --> 02:36:31,000
I think I broke Minecraft.

2908
02:36:32,860 --> 02:36:33,160
Alright.

2909
02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:36,600
Since it doesn't like my late night jazz.

2910
02:36:37,120 --> 02:36:38,860
Let's put on some Minecraft music.

2911
02:36:39,780 --> 02:36:40,920
It's like, hey, hey.

2912
02:36:40,960 --> 02:36:42,060
We detected some music.

2913
02:36:42,080 --> 02:36:43,540
You're going to get in trouble.

2914
02:36:47,900 --> 02:36:48,720
Minecraft?

2915
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:49,820
Play.

2916
02:36:51,190 --> 02:36:51,600
Minecraft?

2917
02:36:52,380 --> 02:36:55,160
Play your music.

2918
02:36:55,500 --> 02:36:56,320
Minecraft.

2919
02:37:01,380 --> 02:37:02,380
There it is.

2920
02:37:06,740 --> 02:37:08,700
That was silly.

2921
02:37:10,520 --> 02:37:11,700
In the end.

2922
02:37:11,800 --> 02:37:13,620
We kind of build a maid cafe.

2923
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:15,600
And we kind of...

2924
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:17,500
No, not at all.

2925
02:37:17,500 --> 02:37:18,840
We did find the cherry blossoms.

2926
02:37:19,140 --> 02:37:21,220
But we did kind of build a maid cafe.

2927
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:23,560
It

2928
02:37:27,320 --> 02:37:28,940
was a pretty useless Minecraft.

2929
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:32,040
Yummy.

2930
02:37:32,160 --> 02:37:33,340
Welcome to bamboo ship.

2931
02:37:33,420 --> 02:37:34,040
Thank you.

2932
02:37:36,520 --> 02:37:38,460
We've detected audio in your stream.

2933
02:37:38,540 --> 02:37:39,460
You guys.

2934
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:43,140
If this stream gets blocked because of my jazz.

2935
02:37:43,360 --> 02:37:44,340
I'm so sorry.

2936
02:37:45,480 --> 02:37:47,660
If it gets blocked because of my jazz.

2937
02:37:47,920 --> 02:37:49,240
I am so sorry.

2938
02:37:49,240 --> 02:37:49,400
Sorry.

2939
02:37:56,170 --> 02:37:57,510
I thought it'd be fine.

2940
02:37:57,930 --> 02:37:58,670
But it's okay.

2941
02:37:59,950 --> 02:38:01,610
If it just gets demonetized.

2942
02:38:01,610 --> 02:38:02,290
Then it's whatever.

2943
02:38:03,470 --> 02:38:05,210
I hope you can join the bishoujo server.

2944
02:38:05,410 --> 02:38:05,610
Yeah.

2945
02:38:05,830 --> 02:38:08,530
I will hopefully have someone.

2946
02:38:09,230 --> 02:38:10,590
To guide me around.

2947
02:38:13,250 --> 02:38:13,690
And...

2948
02:38:14,730 --> 02:38:15,450
I don't know.

2949
02:38:15,490 --> 02:38:16,930
Any other servers I can join.

2950
02:38:16,990 --> 02:38:17,330
We'll see.

2951
02:38:19,290 --> 02:38:21,210
YouTube does not like jazz.

2952
02:38:21,950 --> 02:38:23,150
Not like jazz.

2953
02:38:26,290 --> 02:38:27,350
It's so sad.

2954
02:38:27,570 --> 02:38:28,470
Haven't they...

2955
02:38:31,350 --> 02:38:32,930
Haven't they watched the bee movie?

2956
02:38:37,270 --> 02:38:39,550
The cat is finally suing you.

2957
02:38:39,590 --> 02:38:40,090
For all the...

2958
02:38:44,310 --> 02:38:46,830
My eyes go kind of crazy when I do that.

2959
02:38:50,150 --> 02:38:51,010
It's like the...

2960
02:38:51,010 --> 02:38:51,470
What's it called?

2961
02:38:51,810 --> 02:38:54,110
I've seen that girl that does like the...

2962
02:38:54,110 --> 02:38:55,490
No Chick-fil-A sauce?

2963
02:38:56,130 --> 02:38:57,630
That's how I feel when I do that.

2964
02:38:59,590 --> 02:39:00,910
If you don't know what that is.

2965
02:39:01,010 --> 02:39:02,010
Don't worry about it.

2966
02:39:05,630 --> 02:39:07,330
You do the noise so well.

2967
02:39:07,470 --> 02:39:08,130
Thank you.

2968
02:39:09,490 --> 02:39:09,950
Huh?

2969
02:39:11,310 --> 02:39:11,770
Huh?

2970
02:39:12,690 --> 02:39:13,150
Huh?

2971
02:39:16,910 --> 02:39:17,950
Well guys.

2972
02:39:18,070 --> 02:39:19,930
I'm gonna go eat dinner actually.

2973
02:39:20,770 --> 02:39:21,190
Um...

2974
02:39:22,030 --> 02:39:22,550
Uh...

2975
02:39:22,990 --> 02:39:24,150
Thank you for letting...

2976
02:39:24,150 --> 02:39:25,210
Thank you for...

2977
02:39:25,210 --> 02:39:25,870
You know what?

2978
02:39:25,870 --> 02:39:30,730
Always thank you for letting me just kind of indulge myself with the dumb things that I like.

2979
02:39:31,270 --> 02:39:31,790
Um...

2980
02:39:31,790 --> 02:39:33,530
You guys let me do stupid Minecraft.

2981
02:39:33,650 --> 02:39:35,650
Even when it's just me going on a boat.

2982
02:39:35,810 --> 02:39:36,970
Listening to jazz.

2983
02:39:37,870 --> 02:39:39,430
Going through the night.

2984
02:39:39,430 --> 02:39:40,970
And doing nothing.

2985
02:39:41,310 --> 02:39:41,870
I really...

2986
02:39:41,870 --> 02:39:45,450
You guys are here for no reason.

2987
02:39:45,630 --> 02:39:46,090
But...

2988
02:39:46,930 --> 02:39:48,830
I really appreciate it.

2989
02:39:48,950 --> 02:39:49,610
Regardless.

2990
02:39:51,410 --> 02:39:52,150
Um...

2991
02:39:52,150 --> 02:39:53,510
We love dumb things.

2992
02:39:53,870 --> 02:39:55,670
I know sometimes...

2993
02:39:55,670 --> 02:39:58,650
Like people will be like...

2994
02:39:58,650 --> 02:40:01,250
In Minecraft they just...

2995
02:40:01,250 --> 02:40:01,830
Like...

2996
02:40:01,830 --> 02:40:04,090
They don't do anything in it.

2997
02:40:04,150 --> 02:40:05,550
And that was truly this stream.

2998
02:40:05,870 --> 02:40:06,610
So...

2999
02:40:09,430 --> 02:40:11,790
We'll play Minecraft and just run around and jump.

3000
02:40:12,190 --> 02:40:13,610
And just look at stuff.

3001
02:40:13,730 --> 02:40:14,670
But they never do anything.

3002
02:40:14,850 --> 02:40:16,030
And that was truly this stream.

3003
02:40:16,250 --> 02:40:16,550
But...

3004
02:40:16,550 --> 02:40:19,910
I appreciate you guys watching regardless.

3005
02:40:22,750 --> 02:40:24,690
Even though I wasn't building anything.

3006
02:40:25,030 --> 02:40:25,370
Or...

3007
02:40:25,370 --> 02:40:28,130
But this was my first time getting into Minecraft.

3008
02:40:30,250 --> 02:40:30,770
Um...

3009
02:40:30,770 --> 02:40:31,890
In a long time.

3010
02:40:32,250 --> 02:40:32,770
So...

3011
02:40:33,370 --> 02:40:35,130
It was kind of just nice to...

3012
02:40:35,130 --> 02:40:37,670
And I got to see the armadillos and the new wolves.

3013
02:40:37,690 --> 02:40:38,870
So that was good.

3014
02:40:39,430 --> 02:40:40,590
That was good.

3015
02:40:41,200 --> 02:40:42,610
Here for the bits and banter.

3016
02:40:43,110 --> 02:40:45,530
Literally here for your doing nothing antics.

3017
02:40:45,550 --> 02:40:46,450
I appreciate it.

3018
02:40:49,160 --> 02:40:50,450
I really appreciate it.

3019
02:40:50,510 --> 02:40:53,490
I don't deserve it.

3020
02:40:53,610 --> 02:40:55,610
But I'm very very very...

3021
02:40:55,610 --> 02:40:57,150
Very appreciative.

3022
02:40:57,270 --> 02:40:58,410
Thank you guys.

3023
02:40:59,850 --> 02:41:00,470
Tomorrow!

3024
02:41:01,050 --> 02:41:03,010
We are not doing nothing.

3025
02:41:03,090 --> 02:41:05,930
Tomorrow we are being awesome and cool as hell.

3026
02:41:06,230 --> 02:41:07,870
Tomorrow we are...

3027
02:41:07,870 --> 02:41:09,190
We are...

3028
02:41:09,430 --> 02:41:11,670
We are on the cruise.

3029
02:41:15,610 --> 02:41:16,210
Tomorrow...

3030
02:41:19,080 --> 02:41:19,680
Tomorrow...

3031
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:19,960
Oh...

3032
02:41:22,540 --> 02:41:24,280
Tomorrow we are being cool.

3033
02:41:26,180 --> 02:41:26,780
Tomorrow...

3034
02:41:29,240 --> 02:41:29,840
Tomorrow...

3035
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:31,320
Tomorrow...

3036
02:41:31,320 --> 02:41:31,380
Tomorrow...

3037
02:41:31,380 --> 02:41:32,320
Tomorrow we are being awesome.

3038
02:41:36,540 --> 02:41:37,140
Um...

3039
02:41:37,140 --> 02:41:38,040
Oh my goodness.

3040
02:41:38,180 --> 02:41:39,580
I'm looking at the stream labs now.

3041
02:41:40,900 --> 02:41:42,400
Surely those are free.

3042
02:41:42,560 --> 02:41:43,000
No!

3043
02:41:43,760 --> 02:41:45,440
Built a maid cafe and died.

3044
02:41:45,540 --> 02:41:47,160
This is secretly a mint lore stream.

3045
02:41:51,100 --> 02:41:52,780
Tomorrow we are being radical.

3046
02:41:53,100 --> 02:41:54,260
And awesome and cool.

3047
02:41:54,800 --> 02:41:56,080
And um...

3048
02:41:59,500 --> 02:42:00,700
Kao wabunga?

3049
02:42:00,940 --> 02:42:01,120
Kao wabunga?

3050
02:42:08,220 --> 02:42:08,820
Cool.

3051
02:42:08,820 --> 02:42:08,900
Cool.

3052
02:42:10,960 --> 02:42:11,480
Cool.

3053
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:14,000
And um...

3054
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:15,520
Um...

3055
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:16,380
Yeah.

3056
02:42:17,780 --> 02:42:18,740
Otominto everybody!

3057
02:42:19,480 --> 02:42:20,000
Otominto!

3058
02:42:20,200 --> 02:42:26,440
I feel like I lost my mind a little bit today's stream, so...

3059
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:27,460
I feel like I lost my mind a little bit today's stream, so...

3060
02:42:27,460 --> 02:42:28,540
I'm gonna go check on...

3061
02:42:28,540 --> 02:42:29,580
Unpies.

3062
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:31,200
I'm gonna go make sure she's all good.

3063
02:42:31,380 --> 02:42:34,340
I've just been kinda trying to make sure she's...

3064
02:42:34,340 --> 02:42:34,920
I've been...

3065
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:35,520
Like...

3066
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:41,640
Since she was in here, I thought I could watch her the whole time, but she wanted to leave, so...

3067
02:42:41,640 --> 02:42:42,080
Um...

3068
02:42:42,080 --> 02:42:47,140
She definitely lasted longer in here than Butaro, because he never likes to listen to my voice.

3069
02:42:47,220 --> 02:42:47,920
He hates me.

3070
02:42:48,080 --> 02:42:49,120
He hates me.

3071
02:42:50,500 --> 02:42:53,320
But I'm gonna go check on the little girl, make sure she's okay.

3072
02:42:53,500 --> 02:42:54,760
My little princess.

3073
02:42:56,480 --> 02:42:56,960
Otominto!

3074
02:42:57,140 --> 02:42:57,860
Thank you guys!

3075
02:42:58,840 --> 02:42:59,320
Busted!

3076
02:42:59,400 --> 02:42:59,720
Busted!

3077
02:43:00,300 --> 02:43:00,780
Busted!

3078
02:43:01,540 --> 02:43:02,020
Otominto!

3079
02:43:02,200 --> 02:43:02,600
Otominto!

3080
02:43:02,920 --> 02:43:03,800
See you guys.

3081
02:43:04,920 --> 02:43:05,320
I'm like...

3082
02:43:05,320 --> 02:43:07,380
No, that guy deserves no Otsu.

3083
02:43:07,620 --> 02:43:10,700
That guy deserves no Otsu.

3084
02:43:12,900 --> 02:43:13,500
Bye!

3085
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:20,320
Get it?

3086
02:43:22,800 --> 02:43:24,420
This music's making me sad.

3087
02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:25,500
Okay.

3088
02:43:28,560 --> 02:43:29,500
Bye-bye!

3089
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:37,000
Wait, I think my mic might be on, because I had to change mic stuff.

3090
02:43:37,300 --> 02:43:38,860
So, if you hear me...

3091
02:43:39,460 --> 02:43:40,140
Can I do the outro?

3092
02:43:41,320 --> 02:43:42,480
No, you didn't.

3093
02:43:43,780 --> 02:43:44,340
Peace!
