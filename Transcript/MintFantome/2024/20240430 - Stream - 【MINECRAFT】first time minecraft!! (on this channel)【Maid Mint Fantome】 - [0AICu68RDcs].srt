1
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,060
you

2
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,320
Can you guys hear me through this?

3
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,840
Uh-oh, I think all my audio was messed up.

4
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,580
Hold on.

5
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,680
What's going on?

6
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,000
Output is on.

7
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,040
You can.

8
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:12,600
Okay.

9
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,120
Hold on.

10
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,720
Give me a second.

11
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,400
I don't know why.

12
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,900
It might be double once I fix this.

13
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,860
Oh, hold on.

14
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,440
Let me check this.

15
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:19,680
Streaming.

16
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,420
Streamlight.

17
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,520
Eh?

18
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,810
Uh, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

19
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,010
Brittany, thank you for the 50 gift, and thank you.

20
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,790
Uh, uh, uh, what the heck?

21
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,370
It was just working!

22
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,230
Oh, wait, you can hear this.

23
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,510
Wait.

24
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,710
I'm so confused.

25
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,090
I'm so confused.

26
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,390
We got the music.

27
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:14,670
I wonder...

28
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,970
Hold on, let's see if we can hear the game.

29
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,660
I think you can.

30
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,220
Yippee!

31
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,420
Hold on.

32
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,460
Whoops.

33
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,980
It's a little loud, right?

34
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,840
Is it, like, 7?

35
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,800
6, 8?

36
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,980
Actually, I don't know if that changed anything.

37
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:37,980
Okay.

38
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,620
I'm so...

39
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,000
The audio is low for me all around.

40
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,220
Yeah, but because...

41
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,320
Because it was lowered, because I had to turn on a different
setting.

42
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,860
I'm so confused.

43
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,900
I guess I'll just use this then.

44
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:04,660
Wait, hold on.

45
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,840
Let me check if it works.

46
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,180
Hmm.

47
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:28,560

I don't know.

51
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,350
If I should sound cleaner.

52
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,510
It's all the same.

53
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,810
Whatever.

54
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,530

Thank you!

94
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,180
Is it MGS related?

95
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,320
Why?

96
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,200
Why would it be...

97
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,740
Why would it be MGS related?

98
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,880
MGS...

99
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,420
MGS...

100
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,180
MGS...

101
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,560
Why would it be...

102
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,620
Why would it be MGS related?

103
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,720
Motherfucking Minecraft let's go!

104
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,680
Sako, thanks for the pink!

105
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,820
First time, huh?

106
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,080
Playing Minecraft?

107
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,160
Oh, okay.

108
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,180
You guys, it's a bit of a fib, okay?

109
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,400
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:46,080
This isn't my first time playing Minecraft on this channel
because a couple years ago, Lyrica and Nova and I, we all

111
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,720
did a haunted Minecraft mod map on my channel.

112
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,520
So it's a bit of a lie.

113
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:54,980
I'm sorry.

114
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,380
I'm sorry, hold on.

115
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,820
I'm bowing.

116
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,460
I'm so sorry.

117
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,520
Lying is bad.

118
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,620
It's clickbait.

119
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,040
It was clickbait.

120
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,100
I'm so sorry.

121
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,020
I'm so sorry.

122
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,880
Wait, Jabber, why you lie?

123
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,220
But this is the real time playing just regular Minecraft.

124
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,920
Yeah, I clickbaited because I'm a real YouTuber.

125
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,080
Let's see.

126
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,480
I'm excited to see what our world's going to be.

127
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,580
What should we call it?

128
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,420
That's the first thing we got to do.

129
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,080
What do we call the world?

130
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Also, should I do like...

131
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,060
Hardcore?

132
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,220
Wait, this is hard.

133
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:47,580
No.

134
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,260
Oh, wait.

135
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,040
It would be hardcore.

136
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,140
Outer heaven.

137
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,000
Bustin World.

138
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,280
Made World.

139
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,220
Phantom Zone.

140
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,740
Made World.

141
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,500
Outer Heaven.

142
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,440
Bustin Zone.

143
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:10,900
Oh.

144
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,240
Bustin Z!

145
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,960
See you on the next episode of Mid-World Outer Heaven Bust
Gen Z.

146
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,860
Perfect.

147
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,000
Good job, guys.

148
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,200
Oh my gosh.

149
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:30,620
Whoa.

150
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,860
I wonder where we're gonna start.

151
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,220
I hope it's somewhere good.

152
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:35,820
Cows!

153
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,630
You guys are in Minecraft.

154
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,390
Hopefully there's no lag.

155
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,170
That was the audio, by the way.

156
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,130
Just let me know.

157
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,870
I can change anything you want.

158
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,330
We're in a jungle.

159
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,290
Go punch a tree.

160
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,110
Oh, here we go.

161
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:03,650
Here we go.

162
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,130
Here we go.

163
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,690
Here we go.

164
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:06,870
Oh.

165
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,990
Wait, where's my...

166
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:10,650
Oh.

167
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,470
Okay, I need four of these.

168
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:24,860
Okay.

169
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,140
crafting...

170
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,380
Oh.

171
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,120
Crafting table!

172
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,220
I want it to be nearer though.

173
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,310
The two by two.

174
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,750
Crafting table.

175
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,690
Okay.

176
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,450
Let's go explore the land a little bit.

177
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,130
Oh my gosh.

178
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,190
Okay, I can...

179
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:57,770
Oh, yes.

180
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,030
Check me out.

181
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,990
Yippee!

182
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,110
I'm beautiful.

183
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,130
I'm next to this cow.

184
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,290
Oh, hold on.

185
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,030
I don't want to fall into a hole and like die immediately,
but...

186
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,550
Oh my god.

187
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:12,310
Wait.

188
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,150
Oh, this is a water.

189
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,310
I was gonna say I could have fallen into a hole and died
immediately.

190
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,730
Who's that creeper?

191
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,410
Oh man.

192
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,410
Um...

193
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,830
So, uh...

194
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,450
Yesterday I was supposed to stream.

195
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,710
Oh!

196
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,650
I just realized my eyes.

197
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,370
So...

198
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,650
I'm always so excited when I'm running around.

199
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,350
But I have to open my eyes to be able to play the game, you
know.

200
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,250
She's a professional.

201
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,910
She learns so fast.

202
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,210
So pro.

203
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,650
I can't help that I'm just a gamer.

204
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,930
I adapt, you know.

205
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,730
Being a gamer is all about adapting quickly.

206
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,200
I don't want to go down there just yet.

207
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,280
We have nothing.

208
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:04,880
Am I playing?

209
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,920
Oh, I'm playing in hardcore mode.

210
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,180
Oh my gosh, I forgot.

211
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,900
Okay, wait, we actually need to get some stuff then, don't
we?

212
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,780
We actually need to get some stuff.

213
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,920
Like this little flower.

214
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,420
Today I do want to build a little maid cafe.

215
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,140
I want to do that.

216
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,420
So this game seems interesting.

217
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,400
it gets popular.

218
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,100
It's just like a little kind of indie, right?

219
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,380
I think.

220
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,880
It's a little indie.

221
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,380
Probably like a school project or something.

222
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,100
Hardcore maids.

223
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,640
Speaking of maids, yesterday I finished Akiba Maid Wars.

224
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,300
I finished the show last night.

225
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,080
And, um, wow.

226
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:07,840
That was oh i forgot to finish my sentence from before but
um how was it let me finish what i was saying before and

227
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:19,000

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,760
And, um, I just got...

231
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,040
Oh, no.

232
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,040
I just got Minecraft yesterday.

233
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,480
So hopefully, you guys can backseat a little bit for me if
it's okay.

234
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,660
Tuesday here.

235
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,560
It's Tuesday.

236
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,060
Ah!

237
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,660
Oh, oh, I'm dying.

238
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,220
Oh, God.

239
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,740
Oh, God.

240
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,620
Um, maybe you guys should tell me that I should...

241
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,260
Not drown.

242
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,360
Oh my gosh.

243
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,360
It's April 29th.

244
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,840
Colonel, we managed to avoid drowning.

245
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:10,720
Real.

246
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,140
Oxygen is important.

247
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,580
Okay, let's make ourselves a...

248
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,440
The real crafting table.

249
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,940
I should eat.

250
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,160
Are there any birds around here?

251
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,380
Um...

252
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:40,040
but um yeah so i wanted to make up for it i don't do not
have a schedule this week that i'm writing out because my

253
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:56,680
week is kind of like a little bit weird um so uh i will is
that a skelly man in the day you're not welcome here so um

254
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:07,040
but I will be putting up waiting rooms for streams that I
have that I have confirmed for this week.

255
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,240
Such as I have a Metal Gear stream up for tomorrow, April
30th.

256
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,320
It's totally radical and cool.

257
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,760
Rude, he's just mining his business.

258
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,500
This is my business.

259
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,700
This is my...

260
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,140
I colonize this place.

261
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,000
It's mine.

262
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,700
I'm the ruler here now.

263
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,500
But yeah.

264
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,760
So radical and cool.

265
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,240
It's so awesome.

266
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:43,880
Another thing.

267
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,340
Oh, oh.

268
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,480
We're hungry, you guys.

269
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

270
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,420
Another thing I can tell you guys is Friday I have a collab.

271
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,320
If you watch the Hell Diver stream.

272
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,060
Oh.

273
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,320
A bird I can eat.

274
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:31,000
This is not a bird I can eat Sorry Oh Okay Um Let's eat some
cows Where Skelly and spider Bozo Wait where Why are they so

Okay.

Please die.

278
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:50,920

Okay, gosh.

It's just the Aurora Borealis.

282
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,360
What should the next world name be?

283
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,660
Don't say that.

284
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,260
Don't say that.

285
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,060
Look, I'm punching you.

286
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,120
I'm punching pigs now, okay?

287
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,100
I'm punching pigs.

288
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,340
Doesn't this music really relax you?

289
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,220
During all of this.

290
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,100
Are they right?

291
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,100
Oh, shoot.

292
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,320
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

293

Ouch.

296
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,320
Okay.

So I'm excited for that.

304
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,530

00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,370
EST.

307
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,850
Oh, you guys are starting to get dark.

308
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,130
But yeah, I wanted to just mention that about the...

309
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,130
What is this?

310
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,190
What is this?

311
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,110
What?

312
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,840
Are these guys okay?

313
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,300
I've never seen the wolves of this color before.

314
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,120
New wolf types.

315
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,280
They added new wolves.

316
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,460
What?

317
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,160
Really?

318
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,340
There are different colored wolves now.

319
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,420
Regional wolves!

320
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,280
No way.

321
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,280
You guys are lying.

322
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,200
What?

323
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,000
There's wolf armor too?

324
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:19,920

Nothing can hurt you on the boat at night.

332
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,950
See, this is the most relaxing.

333
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,330
I'll be honest.

334
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,010
Okay, so this is actually music that I listen to like almost
every night.

335
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,070
When I'm like cleaning or winding down or anything.

336
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,230
You can't get me.

337
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,490
You can't hurt me, fool.

338
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,790
This is what I'm listening to at home.

339
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,410
Yeah.

340
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,250
Yeah.

341
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,910
So, Akiba Maidwar.

342
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,150
What is this?

343
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,370
Oh my gosh, a coral!

344
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:08,270
I actually really quite liked Akiba Maidwar, but the ending
was so...

345
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:09,850
Wow!

346
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:18,330
The ending was very sudden, yes!

347
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,190
It was very, very sudden.

348
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:35,590
I'm just gonna steal oh oh can I do I have time to steal
this I think so okay let's go see you suckers now of light

349
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:49,270
the ending was it was yeah um there's always time for theft
True.

350
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,650
Where are we going, I wonder?

351
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,170
What will we find in this world?

352
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,830
This spectacular Minecraft world.

353
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,890
This looks lit up over here.

354
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:00,810
What is it?

355
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:11,910
Oh, I think it's just more coral.

356
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,930
Leave that guy alone over there.

357
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,150
I was just listening to talk about the Russian maid on the
podcast.

358
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,770
Oh yeah, the podcast came out today.

359
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:25,690
If you guys didn't listen, please do.

360
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,010
We are silly, goofy gals.

361
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,530
It certainly ended.

362
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,650
I did not watch the show.

363
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,450
It's like...

364
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,770
I don't want to say a bittersweet end.

365
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,570
But it is kind of bittersweet.

366
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,850
I actually didn't hate it.

367
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,750
At first I was like super shocked.

368
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:53,210
Sorry, I'm trying not to spoil anything in case anyone's
like, I was going to watch Akiba Made War right after this.

369
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,750
Sure, not to spoil, but...

370
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,590
That was good.

371
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,270
I'm excited to make my summer list.

372
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,170
Yeah!

373
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,200
He's got armor on.

374
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,520
I need that.

375
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:08,560
Wait!

376
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,520
This is a mesobion.

377
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,020
Wait!

378
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,420
That's mesobion.

379
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,220
I thought it was a village.

380
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,160
Um...

381
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,900
Hmm.

382
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,000
I think we could just run through this.

383
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,600
Steal the armor.

384
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,760
Hmm.

385
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,280
Let's carry on through.

386
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,060
Do you like the jazz Bozo Ranger?

387
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,380
I don't think there's any saxophone.

388
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,400
This is relaxing.

389
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,480
Just Minecraft sounds and jazz.

390
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,500
I really needed to wind down today because...

391
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:05,980
um to give you guys an idea so i got i got my cat recently
and she's so sweet and so cute do we need a bucket for the

392
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:21,600

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:43,340

um hey hey don't pay attention to me maybe if I go around

395
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,600
this side I'm trying to get to the other side

396
00:27:49,880 --> 00:28:04,210

or she got on the counter and got into some stuff last night

397
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:13,530
um i forgot to put away butaro's food and she ate it and i
don't think she had a good reaction to it and um she was

398
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:21,270
like she threw up the most amount that i've ever seen a cat
threw up first of all which was very shocking i was like

399
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:30,290
whoa i don't even know you could you had that in you um oh
i'm trapped um but she also was like just getting poop

400
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:45,010
everywhere just just endless diarrhea and um and uh there
was like poop in her art not poop there was blood oh there

401
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:57,450

calling the emergency vet i was like what do i do and um

402
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:04,610
Yeah, so I had a bit of a morning cleaning up all that and
dealing with all of that.

403
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,570
So I was like, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna take it easy.

404
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:09,410
And you know what?

405
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,590
Minecraft is a bit of a comfort game for me.

406
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,790
So it sounds like my weekend.

407
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:14,830
For you?

408
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:16,690
Out your butt?

409
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,330
But, um, I think she's better now.

410
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,330
What did I walk into?

411
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:28,610
afterlife.

412
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,910
But that's why she's hanging out with me.

413
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,750
Eek!

414
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,670
That's why she's hanging out with me in here.

415
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,010
We're just, you know...

416
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,490
Yeah.

417
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:43,930
That happened to my new kitten.

418
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,610
Turns out she was having with issues with chicken.

419
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,750
Switch to no poultry diet.

420
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,290
She has been healed.

421
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,670
I think that's it!

422
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:50,950
Mona Pandera!

423
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,090
I think that's it because I feed Butaro chicken.

424
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,850
But I've been feeding her beef.

425
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,350
And then she ate the chicken and then she went crazy.

426
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,270
Isn't that right?

427
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,350
Isn't that right, little girl?

428
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,470
It's so sweet.

429
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,110
She's so sweet, though.

430
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,670
Beef.

431
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,670
They smell like beef.

432
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,670
They smell like beef.

433
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:23,730
Wow, the open sea is under the moonlight.

434
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,310
What's over here?

435
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,370
Could it be another jungle?

436
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,690
Could it be a swamp?

437
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,110
The world...

438
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,570
Just like that.

439
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,850
Uh-oh.

440
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,270
Oh, guys, we're in trouble.

441
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,210
Oh, we're in trouble.

442
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,330
No, we're not.

443
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,710
Nah, we're fine.

444
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,770
But what's her name?

445
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,300

You already said that.

453

455
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,100

456
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,780
Band.

457
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,260
I want a whole percussion.

458
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,760
I want everyone who owns a drum.

459
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,280
To use it right now.

460
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,580
We gotta go murder some more animals, I think.

461
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:37,760
Perfect.

462
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,080
Beef is back on the menu.

463
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,720
I don't know why I'm so embarrassed telling you her name.

464
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,660
It's not even that, like, embarrassing.

465
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,340
Oh, wait.

466
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,200
I should save this.

467
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,900
Okay, I'm gonna death by flower.

468
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,880
Come on.

469
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Stand still.

470
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:58,720
What?

471
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,240
What is wrong with you?

472
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,400
There we go.

473
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,380
Perfect.

474
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,660
I should really...

475
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,320
I should really make a sword.

476
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:15,760
Okay.

477
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,740
Drum roll, please!

478
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,020
Her name is Paz!

479
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,040
Get it?

480
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:29,000
Because it's like cat paws, but it's Paz.

481
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,220
Isn't it cute?

482
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,040
Actually?

483
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:39,860
Right?

484
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,200
It's actually cute.

485
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,140
Actually, her name is Pacifica Ocean, but you know.

486
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,100
Sword.

487
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,480
I thought about, um, what's the word?

488
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,140
Speed running stuff.

489
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,100
Or trying to, attempting to speed run.

490
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,300
But, um.

491
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,380
For today's stream.

492
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,880
But, uh, I don't know.

493
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,960
I thought.

494
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:16,620
maybe you guys weren't ready for that kind of challenge yeah
that is kojima level naming convention

495
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:27,480
i don't know if she wants peace though so it's even truly
more fitting

496
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:41,180
it's a little too intense for us yeah pyes is also peace in
spanish yeah That's why Paz is Paz in Metal Gear.

497
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,400
I'm sorry, I gave my cat a Metal Gear name.

498
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,860
But you have to understand.

499
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,560
It's...

500
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,380
You have to understand who you're dealing with right now.

501
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,400
Is it Paz?

502
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,880
Like P-A-W-Z?

503
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,000
Or Paz?

504
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:56,660
P-A-Z?

505
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,500
It's just P-A-Z.

506
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,120
P-A-Z.

507
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,020
Whoa, that's...

508
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,620
That's water?

509
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:10,980
Whoa!

510
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,960
It looks so awesome.

511
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,820
The reflection of it.

512
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,780
If you're wondering, I'm using complementary shaders.

513
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,200
Wait, so will we see other wolves as well here?

514
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,560
Game looks nice.

515
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,120
It's the complementary...

516
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,780
The...

517
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,880
The...

518
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:42,960
Complementary.

519
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,380
Something.

520
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,880
There's like a little tagline after it.

521
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,080
I don't remember.

522
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,840
Shaders.

523
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,680
No, more than Shaders.

524
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,660
It was like reloaded.

525
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,080
Matrix Revolution loaded.

526
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,860
Watching you play Minecraft, it just feels so right.

527
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:18,720
All right, words can't express the feeling of comfort I have
right now, even though I've never played it on this channel.

528
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,100
That's good though.

529
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,760
Feel comfort.

530
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,460
Wait, maybe we can get some, what's it called in here?

531
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,160
I need some, we need some stone.

532
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,180
But we also need some coal.

533
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,400
Played it once.

534
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,640
You're so right.

535
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:51,400
Sorry.

536
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,260
I can't even remember my own lore.

537
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,340
I used streamer.

538
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,860
I used to watch also use complimentary shaders.

539
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,040
I looked through the Minecraft setting for such a long time
before I realized that didn't mean the shaders were called

540
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,640
complimentary.

541
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,520
Wait, what do you mean?

542
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,260
If you Google complimentary shaders Minecraft, I'm pretty
sure you'll get these, right?

543
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,300
Are you ever going to play with mods?

544
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:18,860
Yes!

545
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,100
I would like to.

546
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,020
Sorry, I just didn't set it up this time.

547
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,360
We're like super bare bones today.

548
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:32,760
But in the future, there will be mods and stuff of the like.

549
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,540
Yes, yes.

550
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,580
I went to May Dreaming for the first time and second time
recently.

551
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,360
It was amazing.

552
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,720
I can't wait to come back and when I go to Japan, Oh my
gosh, generic user!

553
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,340
Glad you liked it.

554
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,740
Maybe we can find a village and pillage their food.

555
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,120
Be on the lookout for some coal, everybody.

556
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,740
Use your little wispy eyes.

557
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,160
I used my eyes!

558
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,120
Oh my gosh, I can't believe I saw that!

559
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,200
Escape route, boop.

560
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,380
No one here?

561
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:06,540
Good deal.

562
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,080
Oh, yeah.

563
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,510
You guys were no help.

564
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:19,630
More.

565
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:27,630
More.

566
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,220
We tried.

567
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,800
I thought about putting on a playlist of Minecraft music
instead.

568
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,600
But I don't know why some of the Minecraft music comes off
very unsettling.

569
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,300
Some of it's just, like, kind of weird.

570
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:58,900
you know some of it's like a little bit creepy self-help is
the best help hi Amori

571
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:10,740
let's get out of skedaddle skedaddle I oh I said get out of
here and skedaddle let's get out of here let's get get out

572
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:16,320
of here let's get out now we can cook our

573
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:19,860
Meats.

574
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:21,960
But...

575
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,440
Looking for a village, but I don't say you will.

576
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,360
Get out of.

577
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:29,620
Hmm.

578
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,220
I went to find Cherry Blossoms.

579
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,600
That's where I will settle.

580
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,860
I used to do Minecraft plus Animal Crossing.

581
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,020
I was like, oh, that sounds like a good combo, too.

582
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,300
Minecraft is a horror game hiding behind adventure.

583
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,260
Yeah, I guess that's why, right?

584
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,020
The music is a little weird.

585
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,260
Hey, Minty, do you know what tomorrow is?

586
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,180
Tomorrow.

587
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,600
This is something special.

588
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,180
We are on a quest.

589
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,500
We are!

590
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,840
A Minty quest.

591
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:13,240
Oh!

592
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,600

When did they add this?

597
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,840
When did they add these?

598
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,160
Oh, they sell... Hold on, I want to hear what they sound
like.

00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,460

Wait, what do you mean the other day?

00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,200

Their purpose is to be slaughtered to make armors for dogs.

610
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,060
I know you're lying.

611
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,900
I know you're lying.

612
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,620
Don't say that.

613
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,160
I know you're lying.

614
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,000
Wow.

615
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,720

How's your water just sitting there like that?

619
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,320
How's that happening?

620
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:09,310
Potion?

621
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,850
Do you have any beds?

622
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:17,490
Like, where do you...

623
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,610
Where do you rest?

624
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:22,790
Whoa!

625
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:27,690
Heck yeah.

626
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,220
Can't see anything.

627
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,540
Where do you sleep?

628
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:43,620
Did I?

629
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,760
Oh, up there probably.

630
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,640
How'd they get up there?

631
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,480
In here maybe?

632
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:53,960
No.

633
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,840
Is that like a temple?

634
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:57,460
Cool.

635
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,320
Might be better now.

636
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,880
The shader...

637
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,980
This shader night darkness is crunchy with the video
compression.

638
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,140
Oh no, really?

639
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,740
Take that.

640
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,500
Thank you.

641
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,380
May you never have a restful night again.

642
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,140
Solidus.

643
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,040
Crunchy.

644
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,960
Good morning, world!

645
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,520
Good morning, Minion.

646
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,200
Delicious.

647
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,440
Food that's not made by me is awesome.

648
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:47,580
You know?

649
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,220
Oh, ha minto!

650
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,660
Oh, ha minto.

651
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,860
Oh, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.

652
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,800
I think I'm going to steal that armadillo.

653
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,580
But also, I'm curious if I kill him what happens.

654
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,340
I'm curious about...

655
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,300
Death.

656
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,080
I'm killing.

657
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,140
She said the thing.

658
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:25,670
There they go!

659
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:28,850
You can do it!

660
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:30,730
Just press space!

661
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:33,690
Oh!

662
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:38,190
You almost made it.

663
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:41,690
Uh-oh!

664
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:42,090
Whoa!

665
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:42,510
Whoa!

666
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,470
Are we good?

667
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:49,070
Are we back?

668
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:49,710
Are we back?

669
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:54,740
That wasn't YouTube.

670
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,320
I said OBS disconnected for a second.

671
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,160
Windows noises.

672
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,100
We're back?

673
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,600
That was so weird.

674
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,200
Surprised me even.

675
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,340
Classic OBS.

676
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:28,180
I won't tell you that that slip up to recover from a...

677
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:28,560
Wait.

678
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:39,260

you talking about what are you talking about huh i'm alive

every

681
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,360
What's going on?

682
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:11,680
What's going on?

683
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,640
Why do I keep disconnecting?

684
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:21,890
We're back?

685
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,890
Turtle, thanks for the super.

686
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:29,790
Super chat.

687
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:37,150
Let's just saw, will you play with Henya?

688
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:38,050
She loves Minecraft.

689
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:38,530
Yeah!

690
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:40,150
I want to play with Henya.

691
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:42,310
Armadillo!

692
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:43,350
Where?

693
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:44,410
He's rolling.

694
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:44,690
Oh!

695
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:49,390
Oh my god, I thought he was a...

696
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:54,010
If I run past them, they roll up?

697
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:55,910
Stop, that's so cute.

698
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,390
Kick him.

699
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,090
Kick him.

700
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:00,790
Play soccer.

701
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,660
I'm playing soccer with this armadillo until my OBS is
better.

702
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:29,790
you run past them they just curl up into a little tiny ball
how did he get all the way down there did he roll can they

703
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:39,970

other guy you

704
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:53,310
kicked him I didn't kick I didn't kick him okay I'm gonna
commit a crime.

705
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,060
Oh, Armadillo shields himself.

706
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,500
Armadillo peaks.

707
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,220
Oh, hold on.

708
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,780
Leave the poor things alone.

709
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,340
You guys said it's for armor.

710
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,930
They didn't drop anything.

711
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:30,490
Oh, dog armor.

712
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:38,980
My bad.

713
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,300
I should have done that when OBS disconnected.

714
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:55,660
I should have taken the chance when OBS disconnected to be a
real criminal.

715
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,960
Does that make you feel powerful?

716
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,060
It made me feel...

717
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,180
I'm not quite sure how I feel right now.

718
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,240
I do feel a little bit evil.

719
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,700
And I like that feeling.

720
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:25,750
Add it to the list of crimes.

721
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:29,270
Crimes!

722
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:33,550
I have no list of crimes, you guys.

723
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:35,630
I'm a ghost maid.

724
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:40,650
I know I just finished watching Akiba Maibor in those games.

725
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:43,710
In that series, they're all criminals, but not me.

726
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:46,790
Dang.

727
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:48,970
Let's go punch some more wood.

728
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:51,650
Actually, no, I think we're good.

729
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:55,250
We might...

730
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,110
We might even be able to make stone.

731
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:00,170
You're a simp.

732
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:00,570
Me?

733
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:02,150
I'm a simp?

734
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:07,270
Did you see Kojima's tweet about saying not being his first
choice for the ending song of Peace Walk?

735
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:07,750
Really?

736
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,650
No, I didn't see that actually.

737
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,370
What was his first choice?

738
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:14,770
It was probably something too expensive.

739
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,130
go away

740
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:39,240
he didn't say but sing was so perfect people are saying it
was imagine no sing what I can't imagine I can't imagine it

741
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,540
being anything other than sing

742
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:52,140
I don't want to imagine another song or I'll cry I can see
it being imagined.

743
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:53,840
What?

744
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:54,880
What is imagined?

745
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,320
Is that Elton John?

746
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,880
Oh, there's a fire.

747
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,040
Imagine all the people.

748
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,420
No, see, it doesn't fit the vibe.

749
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,520
Wait, that's the Beatles, right?

750
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,640
Oh, John Lemon.

751
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,880
Imagine dragons.

752
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:46,960
Lennon.

753
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:50,800
Nice.

754
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,520
No!

755
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,580
It burned!

756
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,040
My food burned.

757
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,520
The beagles.

758
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,120
No, I said the beetles.

759
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:11,190
For what purpose?

760
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:12,630
To have a fried chicken.

761
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:14,390
Duh.

762
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,610
Think smarter, not harder.

763
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:23,190
Thanks for coming back, Mint.

764
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,050
You're welcome.

765
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:30,330
I could have just, I could have, I should have taken the
opportunity to book it.

766
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:32,850
I should have taken the opportunity to run.

767
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:38,330
Mint, you've changed.

768
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:40,930
This is what Minecraft does to you.

769
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:44,050
It turns you into a psychopath, I think.

770
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:49,130
No, I've always been the same.

771
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:53,470
I've always been the same.

772
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,190
Think smarter, not harder.

773
00:53:58,590 --> 00:53:58,590
What?

774
00:53:58,730 --> 00:53:59,270
What do you mean?

775
00:53:59,390 --> 00:53:59,610
What?

776
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:01,190
That's a real phrase!

777
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:03,030
Right every... Oh gosh.

778
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:04,710
We're okay.

779
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:06,670
That's a real phrase.

780
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:07,730
It means...

781
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:11,830
It means think smarter, not harder.

782
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:16,530
something because it's easier.

783
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,260
Work smart.

784
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:23,180
Wait, what do you mean?

785
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,440
What did I say?

786
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,140
Oh!

787
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,520
I'm thinking harder, you guys.

788
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,940
Maybe I do need to think harder.

789
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,620
Maybe I do need to think harder.

790
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,660
What did she mean by this?

791
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,420
I don't think!

792
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,160
I don't know!

793
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,960
I don't even think.

794
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,680
We're gonna go find some place to sleep tonight.

795
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,940
Someplace I won't be disturbed.

796
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,380
What is this?

797
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,180
Rock formation.

798
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,120
Lava!

799
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,480
Shiori!

800
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,580
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

801
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:28,500
Thank you!

802
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,240
Thank you so much.

803
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:32,600
Thank you.

804
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:33,140
Thank you.

805
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,360
Okay, I think we can sleep on top of this tiny block.

806
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,140
Here's my...

807
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:39,680
Ben.

808
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:41,580
Put it down.

809
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,360
Nice.

810
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,500
Woohoo!

811
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:52,780
Alrighty.

812
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,620
I'm back on my...

813
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,280
I'm back on my...

814
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,000
Bullspit.

815
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:01,140
Oop!

816
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,420
For everybody who's like coming in, they're like, what's she
doing?

817
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,140
I'm, I don't know what I'm doing.

818
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,600
I'm playing.

819
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,240
I'm playing Minecraft.

820
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,620
Sorry, should I have said your full name?

821
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,000
Shiori Novella Novelite.

822
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,480
Wait, it's blocked off the rest of it.

823
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,260
Hold on.

824
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,700
I can't see your name, but thanks for the gift in.

825
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,660
Let's go this way.

826
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,960
Next village we find, we're going to bring them the gift of
maids.

827
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,080
A maid cafe.

828
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,820
In their area.

829
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,900
This area kind of sucks.

830
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:02,680
Dolphins!

831
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:04,640
I'm so...

832
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,000
What else?

833
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:05,660
Wait, okay.

834
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,880
What else have they added in the Minecraft then?

835
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:11,440
If they added armadillos and they added...

836
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,280
Uh, what else have they added with the wolves?

837
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,980
Maybe we can go on a hunt for that.

838
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:23,950
Camels.

839
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:24,450
Music.

840
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,210
They got burgers now!

841
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:29,750
They added the deep dark.

842
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:31,390
I've been there before.

843
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:36,070
I just, uh, you know, we can go.

844
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:39,170
It's just, you know, I'm too cool for the deep dark.

845
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:42,810
They added some new discs.

846
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:44,210
The guns!

847
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,050
Burgers.

848
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:46,550
Wait, really?

849
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:47,210
Burgers?

850
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,020
First we have Shiori.

851
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:04,740
Now we have Narissa Ravencroft's All I say is S!

852
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,460
Her Ravencroft's!

853
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,060
Thank you.

854
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,440
Thank you for the five gifted.

855
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,320
Oh my gosh.

856
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:23,920
I can't believe Advent's watching my stream.

857
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,740
Oh my goodness, what an honor.

858
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,720
Fire, fire, light the fire.

859
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,140
Dancing to the...

860
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,580
Something, something!

861
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,820
All right, thank you for the vibe, gifted thank you.

862
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,500
They added circles.

863
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,880
Don't lie to me.

864
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:57,840
This is Minecraft.

865
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:59,520
This is Minecraft.

866
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:04,100
We need Bibu and Flamoko.

867
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:04,760
No.

868
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,220
I think you have to stick your gut out now.

869
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:19,540
Will that summon Bebu?

870
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:23,490
Oh.

871
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:29,110
Wow, how lucky!

872
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:32,030
I just stopped here, but I think it's actually a spot.

873
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,410
I think it's actually a nasty spot.

874
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:37,610
For nasty people.

875
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:41,750
Oh, I don't want to die here.

876
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:43,590
By drowning.

877
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:45,290
Wait, I'm going to become one of them!

878
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:46,130
Oh gosh.

879
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:49,130
That was close.

880
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:51,290
Coming out, idiot!

881
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:53,570
Don't you know how to leave?

882
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:00,550
Is there...

883
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:01,270
Is there anything in here?

884
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:02,810
I can't see.

885
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:03,690
Oh wait.

886
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:11,710
Mon-han.

887
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,580
Maybe there's a chest.

888
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,660
I don't have a thing to get the sussy sand if there is any.

889
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,620
That's a sussy sand.

890
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:30,920
What's wrong with me?

891
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,080
Oh god.

892
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:34,440
Oh god.

893
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,480
Oh god.

894
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,160
Oh god.

895
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:38,000
Oh.

896
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,020
Uh-oh.

897
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,260
There's another fire over there, you guys.

898
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:46,700
Everything's setting on fire.

899
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,140
Oh my god.

900
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:57,520
Koseki, Vibu, Sparkling Platinum, Jan of Hololivey, and
thank you for the 10 gifted.

901
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,540
Oh, here, I was going to do this.

902
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,600
Sticking out your gut for real is...

903
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,260
Wait, Ne Rizzler.

904
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,200
Your soapy bootacks.

905
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,780
Oh, is there anything in here?

906
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:21,020
I don't want to destroy the Sussie.

907
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,360
Oh, oh, no!

908
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,020
I can't open it.

909
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,960
I have to destroy the sussie sand.

910
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,280
How do we make the thing?

911
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:30,680
Hmm.

912
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:33,860
Um.

913
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,960
How do we make, uh...

914
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:42,530
Sussie...

915
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:42,830
No.

916
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:45,470
Um.

917
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,550
Copper and feathers.

918
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:49,770
What's it called, though?

919
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:50,870
Oh my god.

920
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:56,130
Flower, mochoko, top doggy, holy.

921
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:57,570

922
01:01:57,810 --> 01:01:58,470
Thank you.

01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:05,890
We got them all!

925
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:07,870
I feel like...

926
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:10,490
I feel like the Pokemon Master right now.

927
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:18,150
The Infinity Stones.

928
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:19,590
Welcome to membership.

929
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:20,790
Thank you so much.

930
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:23,790
What is this thing called?

931
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:24,930
Um, sand?

932
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:26,250
No.

933
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:26,930
Brush.

934
01:02:27,470 --> 01:02:27,890
No.

935
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:29,910
What's it called?

936
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:32,310
Maybe I haven't unlocked it yet, so I can't see it.

937
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:36,950
Maybe I haven't unlocked it, so it won't show me this.

938
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,250
But let's go find some...

939
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:43,910
Some...

940
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,620
I think there probably will be some over here.

941
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:49,560
Copper.

942
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,180
Get bibu tags.

943
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,160

Oh, no, that's iron.

946
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:00,600
Actually, we need this, though.

947
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:04,680
How can

948
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:09,550

949
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,060

Oh my gosh.

We are actually playing.

957
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,780

958
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:45,160

961
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:57,000
Does it mean you're kind of Captain Planet now or something?

962
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:58,280
Oh.

963
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:05,080
With my five powers combined, I'm Captain Planet!

964
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:08,160
How'd that song go?

965
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,820
Actually, don't remember how the Captain Planet song used to
go.

966
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:27,780

01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:53,860
Oh, I don't know why I even thought that would be...

971
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,340
There's gotta be chickens here.

972
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:00,500
There's gotta be chickens.

973
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:09,830
We're playing hardcore mode, you guys.

974
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:13,210
If I die, we'll never know what's in those hands.

975
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:16,630
We'll never know.

976
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:19,670
That'll be my light.

So we can, when it gets actually dark, we can sleep.

980
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:34,990
Thank you for the silver chat.

981
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:42,710
I need bread.

982
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:46,250
I should also make my meat.

983
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:51,290
I'm gonna go make my meat instead of copper.

984
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:52,870
Okay.

985
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:56,350

01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:07,190

Wait, I'm scared.

01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:46,450
I don't think she can have chicken!

1002
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:50,190
I think she's allergic to chicken.

1003
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:50,770

Use your shovel.

01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,340
Mint, what is wrong with you?

1009
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:37,060

Treasure map.

An emerald!

1012
01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:05,210
Oh, thank goodness this is not any further deeper.

1013
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:08,290
Or we'd be so done, though.

Undersea treasure.

1017
01:08:18,330 --> 01:08:19,490
Treasure, treasure.

1018
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:25,610
Greetings from the Redmond side of Mojang.

1019
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:26,790
Welcome back.

1020
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:28,290
Thanks.

1021
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:32,050
Huh?

1022
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,740
From Mojang?

1023
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:38,760
Real?

1024
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:55,910
Nah.

1025
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,900
I can never tell when people are pulling my leg, you know?

1026
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,900
What a peculiar map.

1027
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,920
Mr. Mojang himself.

1028
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:17,300
Let's see.

1029
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:18,380
What can I get rid of?

1030
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,500
My dirt is really important.

1031
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,980
But I think...

1032
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:26,320
We'll put it like that.

1033
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,180
People need to know someone's been here.

1034
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,040
I will become the hero brine of this world.

1035
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,360
Take my food.

1036
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,840

Yeah, I'm going back for my stuff in here.

No worries.

1043
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:54,560

1044

01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:18,800
Did I?

1092
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,400
No, I thought I put it in the chest.

1093
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:21,860
Did I not?

1094
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,420
Did we lose the bamboo?

1095
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:25,480
It's okay.

1096
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:26,440
It was just one.

1097
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:29,280
It was just one.

1098
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:31,080
Let's go treasure hunting.

1099
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,560
Surely we'll find something good.

1100
01:14:58,150 --> 01:14:58,710
Dangling.

1101
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:02,950
There was a whole bamboo block.

1102
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:04,470
Yeah, that's what I thought, right?

1103
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:06,230
But it disappeared!

1104
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:08,350
So strange.

1105
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:11,130
Maybe I am getting a hero brined.

1106
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:12,690
By fire charge.

1107
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:17,410
We're gonna take that back.

1108
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:19,770
We're gonna transfer all of...

1109
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:21,870
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1110
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:22,850
Don't burn it!

1111
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:25,230
Turning all of this into wood.

1112
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:31,150
I ate it.

1113
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,690
Oh my gosh, I thought that was a person.

1114
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:35,230
This scared me.

1115
01:15:39,090 --> 01:15:39,350
No.

1116
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:44,690
So weird that it wouldn't pick up the chest earlier.

1117
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:48,610
Here, O'Brien.

1118
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:50,830
Okay.

1119
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:08,800
Let's go get us a treasure.

1120
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:12,720
Was it in the mood?

1121
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:18,280
We are, okay, we're north east.

1122
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:20,600
We need to go north.

1123
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,120
No, south.

1124
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,260
We are north.

1125
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:42,410

01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:27,480
Actually, no.

1132
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:33,960
Part of the thrill is digging the treasure when you could
die.

1133
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,440
Oh, I'm spanking off.

1144
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:44,730
I didn't ask for that either.

1145
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,120
Are we going the wrong way?

1146
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,080
West.

1147
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:55,860
South.

1148
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:57,060

Jilly duchies.

1152
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,340
I think we gotta go through the land though.

1153
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,020
Alright, time to fight for our lives.

1154
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,620
Actually, I'm just gonna go to sleep.

1155
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:24,360
Thanks, new ring.

1156
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,080
Uh-oh.

1157
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:25,920
Are we gonna die?

1158
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:27,460
Hey!

1159
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:29,360
Hey!

1160
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:29,740
Hey!

1161
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:30,740
It's daytime!

1162
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:31,620
It's daytime!

1163
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:32,700
Oh my god.

1164
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,080
It's roll!

1165
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,510
Did you guys get scared?

1166
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:04,910
Don't get scared.

1167
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:07,070
Don't get scared.

1168
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:09,770
Everything was under control.

1169
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:13,090
I had it all under control.

1170
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,060
See,

1171
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:24,480
just listen to peaceful music.

1172
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:28,300
Actually I am going to turn my game down just a wee bit.

1173
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:37,570
How are you still alive?

1174
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:49,630
Why is he glowing?

1175
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:53,350
Oh my god, it's still so loud.

1176
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:11,050
Spiders can spawn with buffs?

1177
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:13,030
Oh, there's another guy.

1178
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:15,150
Wait, this guy has armor.

1179
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:17,710
Wait, I gotta need you.

1180
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:19,030
Give me your stuff.

1181
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,310
Give me your stuff.

1182
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:23,630
Dang.

1183
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:27,930
Why do you have buffs?

1184
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:29,390
What are his buffs?

1185
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:37,590
Anyway, where were we going?

1186
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:39,590
Oh, no, we're past it.

1187
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:42,290
We need to go north.

1188
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:55,220
And then, we need to go west.

1189
01:21:57,340 --> 01:21:57,900
This way?

1190
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:05,720
Hiya!

1191
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:09,560
Wait a minute.

1192
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,080
doing it?

1193
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:14,040
No, this way.

1194
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:14,940
This way?

1195
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:16,480
No?

1196
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:20,200
I'm confused.

1197
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:22,260
My feet hurt.

1198
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,120
Are we there yet?

1199
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,320
I think I'm lost.

1200
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:27,360
More west.

1201
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:31,780
This way.

1202
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:33,080
This way is west.

1203
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,460
This is like the most west we could go.

1204
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,000
Absolute west.

1205
01:22:45,560 --> 01:23:05,860

01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:29,010
Like this.

1209
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:29,470
Wait.

1210
01:23:33,170 --> 01:23:33,610
Paz!

1211
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:35,370

01:23:37,370 --> 01:23:38,150

01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:40,230
Come here, come here!

1214
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:42,450
I think she wants out.

1215
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:44,610
She's a...

1216
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:45,550
She's kind of a...

1217
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:46,990
Are you yawning?

1218
01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:49,510
I thought there was something in the game, but it was her.

1219
01:23:50,370 --> 01:23:52,170
She's so, so cute.

1220
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:52,610
I know.

1221
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:53,270
Come here, boys.

1222
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:55,350
Come here, come here.

1223
01:23:55,790 --> 01:23:58,030
She doesn't listen very well, though.

1224
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:01,410
Want this whole time?

1225
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:02,650
Let's have my tongue out.

1226
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:05,750
Come here.

1227
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:07,110
Come here.

1228
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:08,350
Stop honking.

1229
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:08,830
Come here.

1230
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:09,450
Hold on.

1231
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:10,150
I'm going to try.

1232
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:12,110
Come here, come here, come here.

1233
01:24:12,190 --> 01:24:13,430
She doesn't listen very well.

1234
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:15,950
I don't think she like...

1235
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:16,130
No.

1236
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:17,230
Come here.

1237
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:19,630
Yeah, you see the speaker.

1238
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:20,990
Girl, you sweet girl.

1239
01:24:21,650 --> 01:24:22,630
Yes, you are.

1240
01:24:23,090 --> 01:24:24,070
Okay, she just wants out.

1241
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:24,410
Hold on.

1242
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:25,370
Give me one second.

1243
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:42,600
I think she opened the door.

1244
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,620
But I think she's hungry.

1245
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:45,940
So do you guys mind if I, like, feed her real quick?

1246
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:48,500
Give me, like, two seconds to go feed my cat.

1247
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:49,320
Okay, I'm so sorry.

1248
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:51,360

1249
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:52,720
Give me one second.

1250
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:53,880
I'm just going to feed her real quick.

1251
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,180
I'm so sorry.

1252
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:40,780
I'm back.

1253
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:42,580
I grabbed some snacks for me, too.

1254
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:47,940
I, uh, I have no idea how she opened the door.

1255
01:26:49,420 --> 01:26:50,900
Because I shut it.

1256
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:51,980
It's so weird.

1257
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:02,500
Anyway.

01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:05,440

01:28:17,730 --> 01:28:18,470
Maybe.

1275
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:24,130
Maybe you can get lucky and so we'll gift it but fortunately
I can't.

1276
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:27,930
tell you other but it's okay you don't have to member don't
worry about it

1277
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:35,910
village here

1278
01:28:41,730 --> 01:28:42,790
please don't break

1279
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:49,840
oh nice

1280
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:56,300
paperbacks thanks for the vibe gift and thank you

1281
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:02,910
I must.

1282
01:29:04,110 --> 01:29:14,430
I don't want anyone ever to feel like they have to, um, you
know, do something to, like, support me, you know.

1283
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:16,010
Oh, iron sword!

1284
01:29:16,970 --> 01:29:18,030
Let's go, baby!

1285
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:20,730
Let's get some food.

1286
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:21,990
You know what?

1287
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:23,150
Maybe I don't need the wool.

1288
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:24,190
Hard to see.

1289
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:25,490
I don't think we really need.

1290
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:28,790
We don't really need.

1291
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:31,330
Take that, though.

1292
01:29:32,190 --> 01:29:33,030
Take that.

1293
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:33,890
And that.

1294
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:34,390
Oh, wait.

1295
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:35,470
Is this the same map?

1296
01:29:37,290 --> 01:29:37,710
Yes.

1297
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:43,190
So we can get rid of the maps, too.

1298
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:44,610
Very good.

1299
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:49,810
Speaking of JP's next Jaggerico, crunchy or stale?

1300
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:54,640
Crunchy.

1301
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:56,100
I think.

1302
01:29:56,860 --> 01:29:57,400
Willzy!

1303
01:29:57,580 --> 01:29:58,700
Thanks for the five gifted.

1304
01:29:58,840 --> 01:29:59,380
Thank you.

1305
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:01,100
I don't know.

1306
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:06,360
I used to be a Jagger B fan because, like, I thought it was
a little softer and I kind of like that.

1307
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:10,200
But, um, I mean, I thought they are softer than Jagariko.

1308
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:13,360
But now I'm kind of more for the Jagariko.

1309
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:15,180
Mmm.

1310
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:25,220
But for a long time, for a long, long time, I was always for
the Jagabee.

1311
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:28,160
Which do you like?

1312
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:29,480
Jagariko or Jagabee?

1313
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:44,120
Umami flavors high quality too.

1314
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:46,380
Kathleen, thanks for the tiny gifted!

1315
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:49,060
Jagabee, Jagabee, Jagarico, Jagarico.

1316
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:50,280
Haven't had either.

1317
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:51,440
No Japanese snacks for me.

1318
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:57,340
Surely you can find some place that has some Japanese
snacks.

1319
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:02,220
I've wanted to sign up for like a...

1320
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:02,880
I don't know.

1321
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:04,300
Some sort of like, whoa!

1322
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,720
What's going on here?

1323
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:11,260
Some sort of Japanese snack service because...

1324
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:13,680
Oh, it's a whole lot of nothing.

1325
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:14,180
Nevermind.

1326
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:24,240
Because, I don't know, it's just kind of fun to like, to
anticipate something in the mail.

1327
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:24,980
You know what I mean?

1328
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:27,760
Like a monthly like, oh, I'm gonna...

1329
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:28,580
Is that a graveyard?

1330
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,440
I use box.

1331
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:35,400
I've heard of box.

1332
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,700
I've never used it before, though.

1333
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:39,680
How about blue?

1334
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:41,320
Bread!

1335
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:43,020
Spruce.

1336
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:51,780
but um

1337
01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:08,740
but uh they're kind of expensive so I've never signed up for
one will you open up a PO box uh I don't really have plans

1338
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:19,140
to at the moment um oh my god there's more fire everywhere
we go i think hero brain actually is following us

1339
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:26,340
a trick to the japanese stores in manhattan that's so
awesome

1340
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:40,840
yeah um i don't really plan on opening up a p.o box because
i would have to probably manage it myself and i don't know

1341
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,640
what if i get something weird and then

1342
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:59,940
um maybe hopefully hopefully I mean I would like a manager
and then maybe if I once I get a manager whenever that time

1343
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:13,180
comes um I wouldn't be so a throne I don't I don't know like

1345
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:27,040

don't really I don't even know what I would put on a throne

1346

01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:23,120
Rich man house.

1363
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:26,020

Thank you.

1370
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,100
What the heck?

1371
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:52,080
Where's my boat?

1372
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:53,280
Uh-oh.

1373
01:35:57,630 --> 01:35:59,270
The man himself.

1374
01:36:00,070 --> 01:36:01,370
This guy made me move.

1375
01:36:02,770 --> 01:36:03,730
Oh, you get out.

1376
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:10,610
Did I take my boat?

1377
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:12,270
Did I leave it over here?

1378
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:16,790
Where did I leave it at?

1379
01:36:18,510 --> 01:36:20,690
Chimji, thank you for another 10 counted.

1380
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:21,290
Thank you.

1381
01:36:22,050 --> 01:36:22,650
Oh, here it is.

1382
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:26,050
Alright, continuing onward.

1383
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:29,930
Wait a second.

1384
01:36:31,050 --> 01:36:35,190
Didn't I say the next village we come across will build them
a maid cafe?

1385
01:36:36,010 --> 01:36:38,110
We'll show them the wonders of maid?

1386
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:40,310
Yeah, make the maid cafe here.

1387
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:42,690
Yeah, I said that, didn't I?

1388
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:46,090
Okay, we're gonna make it right here in the town center.

1389
01:36:47,050 --> 01:36:47,830
Oh, okay.

1390
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:56,570
I'm already getting opposition to our maid cafe, but that
will not deter me.

1391
01:36:58,930 --> 01:37:01,230
I'm already receiving threats.

1392
01:37:08,010 --> 01:37:09,410
Divine intervention.

1393
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:24,780
He would love to see a maid cafe outside his house.

1394
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:25,740
I'm just saying.

1395
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,440
That would be his number one priority.

1396
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:30,920
Flagship Cafe.

1397
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:32,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1398
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:40,460
Now, the thing about this maid cafe is we can only make it
with stuff that we already have.

1399
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:44,220
So, um...

1400
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:53,040
So, it might be a place that only a mother could love.

1401
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:54,420
Oh, my God.

1402
01:37:54,820 --> 01:37:56,160
I thought that was a Skelly, man.

1403
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:59,380
Budget cuts?

1404
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:00,860
Pretty much.

1405
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:08,880
Until we get more patrons, we are flat broke.

1406
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,820
We eat seaweed every day.

1407
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:23,640
Let's set up a

1408
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:28,460
furnace.

1409
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:31,640
Okay.

1410
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:46,150
and i'm gonna start burning this actually like that okay as
a fellow ghost have you been watching the space ghost coast

1411
01:38:46,150 --> 01:38:53,610

couple episodes i did i actually watched it just a little

1412
01:38:53,610 --> 01:39:03,870

been showing up in my feed so like i'm like yeah you know

1413
01:39:04,970 --> 01:39:08,430
Maybe I will watch some space ghost coast to coast.

1414
01:39:10,030 --> 01:39:11,470
Made ghost coast to coast.

1415
01:39:12,550 --> 01:39:13,450
Love space ghost.

1416
01:39:13,710 --> 01:39:15,890
I always liked, um...

1417
01:39:16,770 --> 01:39:20,310
Uh, I never had watched it, but I always liked the little...

1418
01:39:20,310 --> 01:39:21,890
The little...

1419
01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:24,710
Bug guy.

1420
01:39:25,010 --> 01:39:25,690
What's his name?

1421
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:36,590
But it's funny because I had watched a Zorak.

1422
01:39:38,030 --> 01:39:38,990
Yeah, actually wait.

1423
01:39:40,130 --> 01:39:40,970
There's the other guy.

1424
01:39:41,570 --> 01:39:42,690
I don't know how to describe what he said.

1425
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:43,750
How do you look so?

1426
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:46,750
The hysterical laughter of mint makes my day better.

1427
01:39:48,430 --> 01:39:50,070
What do you mean by that?

1428
01:39:52,690 --> 01:39:53,890
The other guy.

1429
01:39:55,150 --> 01:39:55,630
Moltar?

1430
01:39:55,850 --> 01:39:57,010
Hold on, I'm gonna look him up.

1431
01:39:57,790 --> 01:39:58,270
Mol.

1432
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:05,930
The guy that has the sharp teeth.

1433
01:40:07,170 --> 01:40:08,270
He's so cute.

1434
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:09,930
The Zorak.

1435
01:40:09,990 --> 01:40:10,710
What's the guy?

1436
01:40:11,790 --> 01:40:13,010
Not the guy in the suit.

1437
01:40:13,150 --> 01:40:13,790
Brak?

1438
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:16,410
Maltar's cool, though.

1439
01:40:19,130 --> 01:40:19,570
Yes!

1440
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:21,770
He's so cute!

1441
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:25,570
Why do you already have diamonds?

1442
01:40:27,650 --> 01:40:28,950
What's the thing?

1443
01:40:30,210 --> 01:40:33,590
A certain developer gifted me.

1444
01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:37,950
What's the thing?

1445
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:43,230
The odds are in my favor.

1446
01:40:44,610 --> 01:40:45,210
Oh,

1447
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:54,900
let's just say my dad works at Mojang.

1448
01:41:15,410 --> 01:41:18,350
We're gonna have to mix and match, baby.

1449
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:21,610
This is the first store.

1450
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:22,870
It's very small.

1451
01:41:24,190 --> 01:41:27,750
But that's because we only have, like, one person working
here.

1452
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:41,660
but um oh we have lots of spruce we have so much spruce but

Like, I get out my situation, okay?

1456
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,440
They told me on Twitter to stop buying candles, but I
just...

1457
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:25,480
Oh, down!

1458
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:44,980
See, it's already shaping up really well, right?

1459
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:47,220
And then it's going to be a double door here.

1460
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,880
Made of a mysterious wood.

1461
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:57,660
Door.

1462
01:42:58,340 --> 01:42:59,420
Made of...

1463
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:00,940
No, I don't want spruce.

1464
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,800
I want them to be able to see and see what they're missing
out on.

1465
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:05,600
Made of a jungle.

1466
01:43:08,660 --> 01:43:09,140
Yes.

1467
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:21,980

1478
01:44:33,810 --> 01:44:35,830
It's a Twitch emoji.

1479
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:36,850

01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:44,100

A legend.

1485
01:45:22,940 --> 01:45:23,860
There's too many legends.

1486
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:26,300
You know?

1487
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:30,780
You can't call everybody a legend because then nobody's a
legend.

1488
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:37,420
You can't call everybody a legend, you guys.

1489
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:40,200
There's only one legend.

1490
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:46,120
No.

1491
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:49,080
If you could only have one legend.

1492
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:50,340
Who are you picking?

1493
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:54,900
Turtle chirps?

1494
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,200
Since when do turtles make noise?

1495
01:46:01,860 --> 01:46:03,400
Mint phantom.

1496
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:08,820
I'm the legend.

1497
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:11,440
Minecraft.

1498
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:13,140
Steve.

1499
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,540
You're the big legend.

1500
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:23,100
I can only the world doesn't need any more legends.

1501
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,640
Does Mint a skinny legend?

1502
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:29,840
Possibly.

1503
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:34,360
Um, we're not open yet, sir.

1504
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:39,440
You guys, this town was craving a maid cafe.

1505
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:42,580
They're foaming at the mouth for this place.

1506
01:46:42,740 --> 01:46:45,180
They're ready to be served.

1507
01:46:52,210 --> 01:46:53,410
Maybe we should have a turtle.

1508
01:46:54,890 --> 01:46:54,930
Oops.

1509
01:46:55,670 --> 01:46:56,010
Uh-oh.

1510
01:46:57,450 --> 01:47:00,470
We might have to do an open-air concept.

1511
01:47:02,090 --> 01:47:02,990
Oh, I have one here, too.

1512
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:09,320
I'm ready to serve.

1513
01:47:18,070 --> 01:47:19,650
A glass roof?

1514
01:47:20,970 --> 01:47:22,010
Good idea.

1515
01:47:22,150 --> 01:47:22,550
Good idea.

1516
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:23,070
Good idea.

1517
01:47:23,890 --> 01:47:24,550
Good idea.

1518
01:47:25,890 --> 01:47:26,250
Okay.

1519
01:47:26,370 --> 01:47:28,050
Do you guys see the vision?

1520
01:47:31,630 --> 01:47:32,410
What are you serving?

1521
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:44,080
A knuckle sandwich.

1522
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:46,660
I thought

1523
01:48:02,330 --> 01:48:03,830
I had more stuff.

1524
01:48:05,390 --> 01:48:06,350
Serve turtles.

1525
01:48:07,390 --> 01:48:08,750
What do you think we're...

1526
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:10,390
Inhumane?

1527
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:24,220
Imagine a bank run by me.

1528
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,000
Let's call it a paid cafe.

1529
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:29,540
More like...

1530
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:33,560
More like you're you they take your money.

1531
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:35,480
Cafe.

1532
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:39,140
Sorry if you don't know where I was going with that one.

1533
01:48:42,340 --> 01:48:43,440
Very intuitive.

1534
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:46,840
Go go up.

1535
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:47,940
Thank you.

1536
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,320
Thank you.

1537
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:52,960
Thank you.

1538
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:53,660
Thank you.

1539
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:57,560
Thank you.

1540
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:04,760
Why do you guys watch me?

1541
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:09,360
Why do you guys watch me?

1542
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:10,880
Oh, my shaders.

1543
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:24,120
Oh, no!

1544
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:25,420
Oh, no.

1545
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,480
Please, please, please, please.

1546
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:28,920
Please, you gotta help me!

1547
01:49:28,940 --> 01:49:29,620
You gotta help me!

1548
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,820
Sir, sir.

1549
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:32,880
I heard you leave.

1550
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:33,300
Please.

1551
01:49:39,130 --> 01:49:40,030
Oh, my gosh.

1552
01:49:40,750 --> 01:49:42,030
This place needs me.

1553
01:49:43,230 --> 01:49:44,490
I wonder that myself.

1554
01:49:45,310 --> 01:49:48,350
I wonder that every single day of my afterlife.

1555
01:49:51,150 --> 01:49:52,870
I wonder every single day.

1556
01:49:57,850 --> 01:49:59,510
Fire, fire, light the fire.

1557
01:49:59,930 --> 01:50:01,190
Precisely for this.

1558
01:50:03,590 --> 01:50:06,350
Does it make you... Does it build your confidence a little
bit?

1559
01:50:06,450 --> 01:50:07,450
Are you just like, gosh.

1560
01:50:08,650 --> 01:50:10,230
I'm not as dumb as that, girl.

1561
01:50:13,950 --> 01:50:14,830
rainforest cafe.

1562
01:50:16,150 --> 01:50:18,990
I mean, it's a maid cafe.

1563
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:21,190
It can be any theme that we'd like it to be.

1564
01:50:22,210 --> 01:50:23,250
What are you doing out here?

1565
01:50:23,330 --> 01:50:24,090
This is the jungle.

1566
01:50:25,850 --> 01:50:27,090
This is... what are you talking?

1567
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:28,250
This is the Russian jungle.

1568
01:50:28,430 --> 01:50:29,130
Get out of here!

1569
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:32,490
You're gonna die!

1570
01:50:36,950 --> 01:50:38,290
Did I get these places?

1571
01:50:39,390 --> 01:50:41,710
I can't remember what I've robbed and what I haven't.

1572
01:50:43,690 --> 01:50:45,030
Oh my god.

1573
01:50:45,970 --> 01:50:47,560
This useless out here.

1574
01:50:49,410 --> 01:50:51,470
Living off the land, not paying his taxes.

1575
01:50:53,290 --> 01:50:54,550
Not even with a job.

1576
01:50:59,850 --> 01:51:00,910
Make it a rainforest.

1577
01:51:01,530 --> 01:51:01,950
Okay!

1578
01:51:05,290 --> 01:51:06,610
Get rid of him.

1579
01:51:07,770 --> 01:51:08,510
Where is he?

1580
01:51:09,850 --> 01:51:10,890
Where'd he go?

1581
01:51:12,890 --> 01:51:14,090
Oh, a cat!

1582
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:17,110
Where did he go?

1583
01:51:19,170 --> 01:51:20,650
Where did he go?

1584
01:51:21,550 --> 01:51:22,630
I feel called out?

1585
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:24,170
No, you're perfectly fine.

1586
01:51:26,570 --> 01:51:27,350
Because you're- oh, oh!

1587
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:39,180
If a tree falls in a forest and no one's around, does it
make a sound?

1588
01:51:44,430 --> 01:51:46,010
Like how he's getting mad at me?

1589
01:51:47,050 --> 01:51:48,370
Can't get mad at me.

1590
01:51:49,370 --> 01:51:50,730
You have no job!

1591
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:09,940
You guys, we have to...

1592
01:52:09,940 --> 01:52:10,620
Oh, he...

1593
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:12,220
Actually, maybe we could have made...

1594
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:13,680
Like hired him at the maid cafe.

1595
01:52:18,660 --> 01:52:19,820
Maybe we should have...

1596
01:52:19,820 --> 01:52:21,680
Maybe we could have hired him at the maid cafe.

1597
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:34,220
You killed a potential customer or employee.

1598
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:37,280
Make babies!

1599
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:38,020
Make babies!

1600
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:39,620
Make babies!

1601
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:40,300
Make babies!

1602
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:41,020
Make babies!

1603
01:52:41,540 --> 01:52:42,340
Where do you...

1604
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:44,320
Oh, good, good, good, good, good.

1605
01:52:44,740 --> 01:52:46,160
They already have a baby.

1606
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:47,700
No?

1607
01:52:48,860 --> 01:52:49,900
What do you mean you disagree?

1608
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:52,120
With bread?

1609
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:53,480
Take it.

1610
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:55,000
All right.

1611
01:52:57,380 --> 01:52:58,360
Make babies, make babies.

1612
01:52:58,660 --> 01:53:00,160
Oh, here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.

1613
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:01,020
Oh, yes!

1614
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:01,740
Oh my god.

1615
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:07,980
Babies, babies, babies, babies, babies, babies, make babies,
make babies, make babies, make babies, make babies, make

1616
01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:14,480
babies, make babies, make babies, make babies, make babies,
I need more customers!

1617
01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:17,340
Huh?

1618
01:53:21,970 --> 01:53:24,050
Why won't you populate?

1619
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:27,810
This guy is so stupid.

1620
01:53:28,770 --> 01:53:31,270
No, make a baby.

1621
01:53:31,770 --> 01:53:32,150
Make a baby.

1622
01:53:32,350 --> 01:53:32,630
Make a baby.

1623
01:53:32,850 --> 01:53:33,310
Make a baby.

1624
01:53:34,790 --> 01:53:35,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1625
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:35,750
Oh.

1626
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:46,140
Brett, breed, breed, breed, breed, breed, breed.

1627
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:50,720
Breathe.

1628
01:53:51,180 --> 01:53:51,480
Oh my god.

1629
01:53:51,660 --> 01:53:51,760
Wait.

1630
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:52,080
Oh.

1631
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:57,080
Oh my god.

1632
01:53:57,400 --> 01:53:57,840
Oh my god.

1633
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:01,460
It's happening.

1634
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:02,860
It's happening.

1635
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:05,580
It's happening.

1636
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:07,580
Where is it?

1637
01:54:08,060 --> 01:54:08,060
Ah!

1638
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:26,180
Wait, there's more trapped people.

1639
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:27,820
How many people are trapped in these things?

1640
01:54:30,340 --> 01:54:31,300
Be free.

1641
01:54:32,620 --> 01:54:33,160
There you go.

1642
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:35,860
Wait, this village is actually popping off.

1643
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:40,340
Mint the voyeur.

1644
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:42,320
Don't do it.

1645
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:43,740
Don't do it.

1646
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:45,060
I only have 25.

1647
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:47,840
I can't repair you every time.

1648
01:54:48,820 --> 01:54:49,260
There you go.

1649
01:54:52,340 --> 01:54:52,860
Let's see.

1650
01:54:53,140 --> 01:54:53,800
This guy too.

1651
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:57,820
And the cat.

1652
01:55:03,580 --> 01:55:04,140
Okay.

1653
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:07,280
This is your first time playing Minecraft.

1654
01:55:07,820 --> 01:55:12,680
Well, technically, it's like my first time playing the
normal Minecraft.

1655
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:13,500
You know what I'm saying?

1656
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:16,200
Oh my gosh.

1657
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:17,980
What?

1658
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:20,820
This baby took my bed!

1659
01:55:27,170 --> 01:55:27,850
How dare.

1660
01:55:30,350 --> 01:55:32,050
You're working for me.

1661
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:33,550
Hold on.

1662
01:55:33,710 --> 01:55:34,150
Hold on.

1663
01:55:34,270 --> 01:55:34,750
Okay, hold on.

1664
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:37,430
No, no, no, come back.

1665
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:48,060
Uh-oh.

1666
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:49,560
Wait, that's gonna catch on fire.

1667
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:51,780
Maybe not.

1668
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:51,940
Oh!

1669
01:55:58,540 --> 01:56:00,240
I don't have a way to break this.

1670
01:56:01,460 --> 01:56:02,620
How did they get out?

1671
01:56:08,020 --> 01:56:09,900
I don't think I have a way to break.

1672
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:15,460
My obsidian.

1673
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:24,020
Wait, wait.

1674
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:28,400
Okay, hold on.

1675
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:29,880
Get in there.

1676
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:30,940
Get in there.

1677
01:56:33,340 --> 01:56:35,160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1678
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:36,480
Kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid.

1679
01:56:44,180 --> 01:56:45,400
He'll be back.

1680
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:46,880
You'll be back, Lemon.

1681
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:49,600
You'll be back.

1682
01:56:51,180 --> 01:56:51,320
Okay.

1683
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:54,240
We don't have time to worry about this kid right now,
though.

1684
01:56:54,980 --> 01:56:56,640
We have a main cafe to build.

1685
01:57:03,710 --> 01:57:05,910
He's wary of my ways?

1686
01:57:07,810 --> 01:57:08,330
Nah.

1687
01:57:10,110 --> 01:57:10,630
Nah.

1688
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:15,640
I want him to work for me.

1689
01:57:18,540 --> 01:57:19,800
He's an orphan.

1690
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,080
His parents are dead, probably.

1691
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:34,840
No joke, you just made my mantis egg hatch.

1692
01:57:41,090 --> 01:57:42,430
What did I...

1693
01:57:42,430 --> 01:57:43,070
Am I a mom?

1694
01:57:43,530 --> 01:57:44,270
What did I...

1695
01:57:44,270 --> 01:57:44,630
Huh?

1696
01:57:45,390 --> 01:57:46,570
How did I...

1697
01:57:46,570 --> 01:57:47,370
How did that happen?

1698
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:50,220
Huh?

1699
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:52,960
Is that a euphemism?

1700
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:54,200
I don't...

1701
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:55,920
I don't know.

1702
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:58,920
Huh?

1703
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:02,760
Am I a mom?

1704
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:10,780
Oh, he's a cartographer now.

1705
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:11,660
He's working right here.

1706
01:58:16,860 --> 01:58:17,700
Okay.

1707
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:31,560
We might have to have a glass roof and not in like the you
know break the glass ceiling kind of way.

1708
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:40,520
But I'm going to put pumpkins on each corner for a little
bit of flair in our in our

1709
01:58:43,690 --> 01:58:51,870
in our rainforest mid cafe mother

1710
01:58:55,510 --> 01:59:07,930
he posted literal praying mantis eggs he is being as literal
as it is possible to be but what did I do to cause this was

1711
01:59:07,930 --> 01:59:15,870
it my charm did they say like oh my god Who is this sweet,
angelic voice we hear?

1712
01:59:16,630 --> 01:59:23,250
We must be born so we can identify the cause of this.

1713
01:59:29,140 --> 01:59:29,560
Yes.

1714
01:59:31,980 --> 01:59:34,080
You have that fertile aura.

1715
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:35,420
Let's not say it like that.

1716
01:59:38,620 --> 01:59:39,660
I am not Chihuahua.

1717
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:40,240
I am Fuawa.

1718
01:59:40,460 --> 01:59:41,020
I am not Fuawa.

1719
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:41,760
I am Makuko.

1720
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:43,320
Together we are Fuamoko.

1721
01:59:43,660 --> 01:59:43,820
Wow, wow.

1722
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:02,620
Don't push me.

1723
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:03,900
This is my house.

1724
02:00:11,670 --> 02:00:13,650
What happened to you again?

1725
02:00:17,310 --> 02:00:19,210
Why is nobody visiting yet?

1726
02:00:21,670 --> 02:00:23,610
Why is nobody visiting yet?

1727
02:00:24,230 --> 02:00:26,090
Oh, well, we don't have any tables or anything.

1728
02:00:27,830 --> 02:00:28,450
It's okay.

1729
02:00:28,850 --> 02:00:29,550
We'll have it soon.

1730
02:00:29,650 --> 02:00:30,310
We'll have it soon.

1731
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:35,590
No worries.

1732
02:00:35,910 --> 02:00:36,670
There are no maids.

1733
02:00:36,950 --> 02:00:37,590
Not yet.

1734
02:00:38,090 --> 02:00:39,290
Not with that attitude.

1735
02:00:40,850 --> 02:00:41,850
Am I nothing to you?

1736
02:00:42,270 --> 02:00:44,490
Am I not a maid?

1737
02:00:48,180 --> 02:00:49,320
Am I nothing to you?

1738
02:00:49,800 --> 02:00:51,000
I'm right here.

1739
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:57,440
Build it and they will come.

1740
02:00:58,500 --> 02:00:58,900
Okay.

1741
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:02,640
Thank you for your wise wisdoms.

1742
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:07,240
only mate I want, mate.

1743
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:11,320
Stop it.

1744
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:17,400
Stop it.

1745
02:01:37,540 --> 02:01:40,780
I'm just gonna take these back if you're not gonna use them,
you know?

1746
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:44,680
I'm just gonna take those back if you're not gonna use them.

1747
02:01:49,070 --> 02:01:51,230
What will you serve in the cafe?

1748
02:01:51,950 --> 02:01:52,750
Good question.

1749
02:01:53,810 --> 02:01:59,310
Mate, I interest you in salmon.

1750
02:02:01,410 --> 02:02:03,470
Freshest in the sea.

1751
02:02:04,490 --> 02:02:06,590
Or perhaps...

1752
02:02:17,410 --> 02:02:18,130
Perhaps...

1753
02:02:18,130 --> 02:02:18,750
Priest.

1754
02:02:19,650 --> 02:02:20,770
Just a little priest.

1755
02:02:21,490 --> 02:02:23,050
Oh, oh, I almost fell through.

1756
02:02:27,620 --> 02:02:29,020
Don't say it.

1757
02:02:32,260 --> 02:02:33,660
Don't say it.

1758
02:02:34,540 --> 02:02:35,480
Please not him.

1759
02:02:35,660 --> 02:02:36,340
He's too gummy.

1760
02:02:37,820 --> 02:02:38,940
Gummy kid.

1761
02:02:39,940 --> 02:02:46,040
Start up in armory so you can have plenty of armaments.

1762
02:02:58,970 --> 02:03:00,770
She's gonna serve humans.

1763
02:03:01,390 --> 02:03:02,390
Um, yeah, I am.

1764
02:03:02,490 --> 02:03:05,650
I'm serving them as my masters.

1765
02:03:07,130 --> 02:03:07,210
Duh.

1766
02:03:10,690 --> 02:03:11,330
Duh.

1767
02:03:12,490 --> 02:03:12,750
Wow!

1768
02:03:13,230 --> 02:03:18,310
Oh my gosh, now I can watch how the goings on in the maid
cafe are.

1769
02:03:20,250 --> 02:03:21,690
from above.

1770
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:26,700
Kiwawa and Hinyo were both serving something recently.

1771
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:28,340
I won't say it!

1772
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:30,120
You can't make me!

1773
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:33,780
You can't make me say it!

1774
02:03:34,180 --> 02:03:35,520
You can't!

1775
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:37,100
I won't.

1776
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:39,680
You won't catch me saying it.

1777
02:03:42,740 --> 02:03:44,560
You won't catch me!

1778
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:50,580
But it's okay if my Oshi say it.

1779
02:03:51,220 --> 02:04:04,460
me my oh she's can say whatever they want there oh wait how
do we oh we need to get some clay right for um our sherd oh

1780
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:09,860

1781
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:23,620
oh she's are without flaw or blame exactly exactly that's
why it's okay if they say it

1782
02:04:30,180 --> 02:04:31,560
Are we gonna be here?

1783
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:35,560
As a woman, I finally saved the last $5 for my rent.

1784
02:04:36,100 --> 02:04:37,580
Now I can not get kicked out.

1785
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:42,880
Don't send it to me then!

1786
02:04:47,430 --> 02:04:49,430
My cunt is sad now.

1787
02:04:50,990 --> 02:04:51,250
Who?

1788
02:04:57,120 --> 02:04:59,560
Why are you talking in third person like a weirdo?

1789
02:04:59,820 --> 02:05:00,700
Wait, is it this one?

1790
02:05:05,390 --> 02:05:05,890
What?

1791
02:05:05,930 --> 02:05:09,470
you know Mike

1792
02:05:36,330 --> 02:05:37,690
some things

1793
02:05:44,140 --> 02:05:57,640
some things are just really hard to remember but sometimes
as a streamer there are things that you must remember and I

1794
02:05:57,640 --> 02:06:00,220
fell I broke that rule

1795
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,120
I I

1796
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:27,360
My man Mike is important to me.

1797
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:28,740
I'd never forget about him.

1798
02:06:34,290 --> 02:06:35,570
That guy ruined my life.

1799
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:38,610
My afterlife even.

1800
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:44,360
Oh, I think I'm...

1801
02:06:46,180 --> 02:06:46,360
Ah!

1802
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:47,520
Ah!

1803
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:49,060
Oh god!

1804
02:06:49,340 --> 02:06:49,620
Oh no!

1805
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:07,980
I

1806
02:07:13,290 --> 02:07:16,270
died because of Mike Hunt.

1807
02:07:19,130 --> 02:07:21,690
It's all your fault.

1808
02:07:22,430 --> 02:07:22,950
Mike!

1809
02:07:27,420 --> 02:07:29,800
Why would you do this to me?

1810
02:07:47,650 --> 02:07:48,150
You...

1811
02:07:48,650 --> 02:07:49,790
Oh, my...

1812
02:07:49,790 --> 02:07:51,310
The maid cafe!

1813
02:07:52,670 --> 02:07:53,670
Wait.

1814
02:07:54,410 --> 02:07:55,530
They just disappeared.

1815
02:07:55,790 --> 02:07:56,010
What happened?

1816
02:07:56,130 --> 02:07:56,950
Oh, here they are.

1817
02:07:57,470 --> 02:07:57,470
You!

1818
02:07:57,910 --> 02:07:59,330
Where were you?

1819
02:08:01,070 --> 02:08:03,070
It's literally your job.

1820
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:05,130
I cannot believe I tuned in just in time.

1821
02:08:05,570 --> 02:08:06,250
Okay, Rice Nat.

1822
02:08:06,710 --> 02:08:07,950
Okay, okay, right.

1823
02:08:08,190 --> 02:08:08,950
Okay, Rice Nat.

1824
02:08:09,450 --> 02:08:09,690
Okay.

1825
02:08:10,330 --> 02:08:11,710
I can't believe you.

1826
02:08:11,830 --> 02:08:13,150
Where were you?

1827
02:08:17,450 --> 02:08:22,470
I heard them coming.

1828
02:08:22,770 --> 02:08:23,750
I heard them coming.

1829
02:08:24,410 --> 02:08:30,310
I was just about to get in the shower and I heard the
screams just want to say rip bozo.

1830
02:08:32,150 --> 02:08:35,770
Wow, look how beautiful it was down here.

1831
02:08:36,270 --> 02:08:37,110
Whoa, whoa.

1832
02:08:38,250 --> 02:08:38,770
Diamond.

1833
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:46,260
Mods band that man.

1834
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:48,460
Where are you?

1835
02:08:48,860 --> 02:08:49,420
Who was it?

1836
02:08:49,460 --> 02:08:51,380
It was customer Johnson, wasn't it you?

1837
02:08:51,860 --> 02:08:53,560
The sent me about Mike?

1838
02:08:54,680 --> 02:08:55,080
Right?

1839
02:08:56,840 --> 02:08:58,660
I can't believe Mint died of Ligma.

1840
02:09:02,120 --> 02:09:04,200
Shut the hell out, Lily, please.

1841
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:05,580
Shut up.

1842
02:09:06,600 --> 02:09:06,720
Oh!

1843
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:14,120
We're in...

1844
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:14,280
Oh!

1845
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:15,700
Oh!

1846
02:09:16,420 --> 02:09:17,400
I don't know!

1847
02:09:17,660 --> 02:09:18,780
What's going on?

1848
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:20,220
Ow!

1849
02:09:21,380 --> 02:09:22,540
What's that over there?

1850
02:09:22,940 --> 02:09:24,260
I think I see the light.

1851
02:09:26,100 --> 02:09:26,740
No!

1852
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:29,660
Oh, this is the village that I died!

1853
02:09:37,350 --> 02:09:39,830
Hardcore mode is suffering.

1854
02:09:45,260 --> 02:09:46,720
What's that down there?

1855
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,800
I wonder if we can find something interesting.

1856
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:55,020
Oh, it just looks so square I thought it was like...

1857
02:09:55,020 --> 02:09:57,280
The world... Oh, we're back.

1858
02:09:58,200 --> 02:09:59,800
Oh, we're back.

1859
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:01,840
We're gone and we're back.

1860
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:18,280
specimen what does that mean what does that even mean that
is so rude i'm more than a specimen literal actual god stop

1861
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:29,980
laughing at me i'm going to what happened why suddenly
creative nothing i got bored of playing the game for real

1862
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:41,800
Well, everybody, oh.

1863
02:10:45,880 --> 02:10:47,880
I wonder if it will let me do this.

1864
02:10:49,420 --> 02:10:50,000
Stop pausing.

1865
02:11:02,330 --> 02:11:03,990
It had to be done.

1866
02:11:04,550 --> 02:11:04,970
Did it?

1867
02:11:05,870 --> 02:11:07,730
Did it customer support?

1868
02:11:08,890 --> 02:11:09,850
Customer support?

1869
02:11:13,410 --> 02:11:13,930
Sorry.

1870
02:11:14,690 --> 02:11:17,970
You know, usually when you say customer support, I mean,
it's so good.

1871
02:11:38,830 --> 02:11:41,550
I'm sorry.

1872
02:11:41,850 --> 02:11:44,170
Maybe she changed her name.

1873
02:11:46,910 --> 02:11:48,250
Oh god.

1874
02:11:56,870 --> 02:12:00,530
To your first or second death, thank you.

1875
02:12:05,850 --> 02:12:07,410
Um, wait, back to game.

1876
02:12:08,690 --> 02:12:10,050
I'm going now!

1877
02:12:12,450 --> 02:12:15,690
But every time I click out of Minecraft, it puts up the...

1878
02:12:15,690 --> 02:12:17,810
It does that, so it doesn't, um...

1879
02:12:17,810 --> 02:12:19,490
I can't really zoom out.

1880
02:12:24,290 --> 02:12:24,710
Um...

1881
02:12:24,710 --> 02:12:28,550
Your comedic typing is so perfect and outsider would think
he's a crimson.

1882
02:12:29,130 --> 02:12:30,090
What do you mean?

1883
02:12:32,290 --> 02:12:33,310
What is that?

1884
02:12:33,570 --> 02:12:34,870
Wait, what is that up there?

1885
02:12:34,950 --> 02:12:35,650
Do you see that?

1886
02:12:36,370 --> 02:12:37,970
Wait, what is that in the sky?

1887
02:12:40,050 --> 02:12:41,050
What is that?

1888
02:12:44,290 --> 02:12:45,830
Oh my god, it's the village!

1889
02:12:49,990 --> 02:12:51,310
It's the best.

1890
02:12:52,030 --> 02:12:52,750
It's the best.

1891
02:12:56,580 --> 02:12:59,760
I keep seeing these things floating in the sky.

1892
02:13:00,900 --> 02:13:03,020
I'm actually crying, you guys.

1893
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:08,220
This isn't funny anymore and I'm tiny and I can't get big.

1894
02:13:09,860 --> 02:13:11,580
I'm small and the world is...

1895
02:13:11,580 --> 02:13:12,920
See, this is what I'm seeing.

1896
02:13:14,580 --> 02:13:16,060
Help me, please.

1897
02:13:22,570 --> 02:13:23,250
No.

1898
02:13:26,230 --> 02:13:30,590
This is like a like mosquito simulator.

1899
02:13:31,050 --> 02:13:32,410
What if I just keep going forever?

1900
02:13:32,770 --> 02:13:33,510
Hold on.

1901
02:13:34,090 --> 02:13:34,730
This way.

1902
02:13:38,570 --> 02:13:40,110
I'm dying now.

1903
02:13:42,370 --> 02:13:43,050
I'm dying.

1904
02:13:44,010 --> 02:13:45,110
Well, I'm already dead.

1905
02:13:45,550 --> 02:13:46,170
I'm dead.

1906
02:13:47,530 --> 02:13:53,130
I'm going back to heaven because of my hunt.

1907
02:13:56,090 --> 02:14:01,590
Thank you for joining me on this afterlife journey.

1908
02:14:05,530 --> 02:14:11,150
Don't fall for, don't fall for the name.

1909
02:14:16,270 --> 02:14:18,150
See you in another four years, Mint.

1910
02:14:20,070 --> 02:14:21,070
Where are we?

1911
02:14:21,730 --> 02:14:22,870
Still in the void, okay.

1912
02:14:25,970 --> 02:14:27,490
It's nice and bright up here.

1913
02:14:27,550 --> 02:14:46,530
I'm basically toasting I'm frying I'm sizzling Don't go into
the light I am the light I will be a guiding light In your

1914
02:14:46,530 --> 02:15:01,210
sad lives So that you Never Say bad things again I'm going
to I wonder where we are.

1915
02:15:02,050 --> 02:15:02,770
Like, actually.

1916
02:15:03,070 --> 02:15:03,990
I wonder if it'll load.

1917
02:15:05,490 --> 02:15:07,210
Aren't she supposed to spectate the world?

1918
02:15:09,190 --> 02:15:10,190
I guess it's gone.

1919
02:15:15,670 --> 02:15:16,950
Praise the sun.

1920
02:15:19,350 --> 02:15:21,250
Praise the sun.

1921
02:15:22,850 --> 02:15:25,210
Doesn't work properly on Java edition yet.

1922
02:15:25,470 --> 02:15:26,450
Oh, okay, okay.

1923
02:15:43,210 --> 02:15:43,790
Anyway...

1924
02:15:43,790 --> 02:15:45,710
That was silly, wasn't it?

1925
02:15:47,810 --> 02:15:49,530
That was pretty goofy, wasn't it?

1926
02:15:51,690 --> 02:15:53,390
Give pies lots of pets.

1927
02:15:53,830 --> 02:15:54,490
Oh, Sumito!

1928
02:15:54,850 --> 02:15:56,070
No, no, no, no, no!

1929
02:15:56,450 --> 02:15:57,850
Let's make another world.

1930
02:15:57,990 --> 02:15:58,970
It doesn't have to be hardcore.

1931
02:15:59,270 --> 02:16:00,250
I'm so sad.

1932
02:16:00,510 --> 02:16:02,550
Made world Outer Heaven Busted Z!

1933
02:16:03,810 --> 02:16:06,770
We'll never be able to go back to you!

1934
02:16:06,990 --> 02:16:08,790
Made world Outer Heaven Busted Z!

1935
02:16:11,290 --> 02:16:12,510
That's so sad.

1936
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:30,020
X.

1937
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:37,580
Oh.

1938
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:41,960
It loads so fast.

1939
02:16:42,380 --> 02:16:44,200
I feel like I remember in the past.

1940
02:16:44,300 --> 02:16:46,360
Worlds used to take, like, a long time to load.

1941
02:16:47,580 --> 02:16:48,520
Oh, you're back!

1942
02:16:50,860 --> 02:16:51,820
This time...

1943
02:16:52,420 --> 02:16:53,840
better than ever

1944
02:16:56,920 --> 02:17:11,520
Savannah Oh, I forgot to do the I forgot to put hardcore,
you guys, I forgot to put hardcore I would like to do a

1945
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:24,100
server or join a server I have talked with Henya and Mousy
about maybe if they want to give me a of the maybe the

1946
02:17:24,100 --> 02:17:31,200
Vshojo server but it kind of scares me because oh gosh I'm
gonna die like no I'm not I'm not gonna die um it kind of

1947
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:41,140
scares me because like they have they have so many mods um
so I'm a little intimidated by it but we'll see um

1948
02:17:44,880 --> 02:17:57,500
we'll see what happens their mod pack is awesome um I've
only watched, like, Kenya play.

1949
02:17:58,860 --> 02:18:01,280
And I'm just like, this doesn't even feel like Minecraft.

1950
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:07,040
But it would be fun to try at least.

1951
02:18:07,620 --> 02:18:16,000
And I haven't entirely given up on the server of my own
server for people to play.

1952
02:18:16,820 --> 02:18:18,400
I just...

1953
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:21,920
I still just don't know.

1954
02:18:23,300 --> 02:18:35,960
what to do entirely yet is all make it a hardcore server
that would be so intense wouldn't it

1955
02:18:45,730 --> 02:18:47,510
i wonder if there's any armadillos

1956
02:18:51,010 --> 02:18:59,270
but yeah so um hopefully next time i play minecraft i just
kind of like i said i wanted to play something that was oh

1957
02:18:59,270 --> 02:19:10,350
there's the armadillo I want to play something that was a
little bit more of my comfort since I had a crazy day today.

1958
02:19:13,010 --> 02:19:15,590
Um, did you just start a forest flyer?

1959
02:19:16,470 --> 02:19:17,730
Now I didn't.

1960
02:19:18,890 --> 02:19:22,470
The new wolves are so cute!

1961
02:19:23,530 --> 02:19:25,590
They're so sweet.

1962
02:19:26,310 --> 02:19:27,690
Little brown dogs.

1963
02:19:29,010 --> 02:19:30,950
Little dogs, little dogs.

1964
02:19:32,450 --> 02:19:38,210
But yeah, sorry, I'm just kind of like running and I'm
afraid of this ghost.

1965
02:19:39,030 --> 02:19:40,130
You shouldn't be...

1966
02:19:40,710 --> 02:19:42,110
You shouldn't be real.

1967
02:19:43,150 --> 02:19:45,150
Oh my gosh, and there's a jungle right over here.

1968
02:19:46,130 --> 02:19:47,190
Maybe we'll get a panda.

1969
02:19:53,710 --> 02:19:55,690
Casually sits the forest on fire.

1970
02:19:59,290 --> 02:20:00,730
No, these look the same.

1971
02:20:02,050 --> 02:20:03,410
Maybe they're a little...

1972
02:20:04,190 --> 02:20:05,210
They're a little...

1973
02:20:05,210 --> 02:20:05,930
I can't tell.

1974
02:20:06,410 --> 02:20:08,510
Are they the same as those dogs?

1975
02:20:09,370 --> 02:20:10,290
I can't tell.

1976
02:20:12,450 --> 02:20:12,810
Ouch.

1977
02:20:22,960 --> 02:20:24,960
This is how I make food sometimes.

1978
02:20:25,940 --> 02:20:27,120
In Minecraft, obviously.

1979
02:20:35,240 --> 02:20:36,600
Don't touch me!

1980
02:20:40,240 --> 02:20:40,920
Uh.

1981
02:20:41,700 --> 02:20:41,840
Oh.

1982
02:20:42,840 --> 02:20:43,380
Come back.

1983
02:20:43,980 --> 02:20:44,440
Come back.

1984
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:46,040

Fire pig.

1991
02:21:05,720 --> 02:21:16,240
But yeah, like I said, hopefully I will be on a server next
time, whether it be my own or probably most likely somebody

1992
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:16,880
else's.

1993
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:20,280

1997
02:21:48,920 --> 02:21:59,660
google form anybody who's interested and it's gonna be kind
of like more lottery based so um i that way you know you

So, um...

That's what I plan to do.

2003
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:33,200
Um, I think I'll have the stream, uh, on Sunday, since I
didn't do it Sunday.

2004
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:37,460
This time.

2005
02:22:38,120 --> 02:22:39,480
I'll do another Sunday.

2006
02:22:40,520 --> 02:22:42,620
But what if we want to keep throwing money at you?

2007
02:22:43,400 --> 02:22:49,500
Well, that's very generous of you, but I don't want people
to feel like they are always having to throw money at me,

2008
02:22:49,540 --> 02:22:49,900
you know?

2009
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:58,160

want to exclude anybody so

2010
02:23:02,040 --> 02:23:20,260

how fast we can get blown up by a creeper hold on i'm gonna

02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:21,940
I'm gonna cut down a tree.

2012
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:23,040
We're gonna die.

2013
02:23:23,320 --> 02:23:24,120
We're gonna die here.

2014
02:23:25,380 --> 02:23:26,340
And we're gonna dig down.

2015
02:23:27,220 --> 02:23:29,160
I will aggressively throw money at mint.

2016
02:23:29,860 --> 02:23:29,860

2017
02:23:30,320 --> 02:23:32,180

So, um, I don't...

2023
02:23:42,940 --> 02:23:49,480
There will probably be quite a bunch of people that, um,
will want to participate.

2024
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:49,900
Oh, wait.

2025
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:58,920

the stream and then um

2026
02:24:02,580 --> 02:24:12,020
and then i can do it again another time when i ultimately
don't get to everybody hello where are the where are the bad

I might be thinking with portals right now.

2036
02:24:44,780 --> 02:24:46,320
I might be thinking with portals right now.

02:24:48,760 --> 02:24:50,000

2045
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:09,320
Okay.

Yeah, we're gaming.

2048
02:25:11,460 --> 02:25:11,740
We're gaming.

2049
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:12,260
We're gaming.

2050
02:25:13,400 --> 02:25:14,140
We're gaming.

2051
02:25:14,380 --> 02:25:14,620
We're gaming.

2052
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:14,940
We're gaming.

2053
02:25:14,940 --> 02:25:15,420
Okay, here we go.

2054
02:25:17,020 --> 02:25:18,360
Time to dig down, baby!

2055
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:22,120
I found time to dig down.

02:25:22,140 --> 02:25:23,660
Thank you for the 50 of it!

2057
02:25:24,120 --> 02:25:24,960
Thank you!

2058
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:29,000
Oh, we got some coal.

2059
02:25:30,340 --> 02:25:31,300
I hear a spider.

2060
02:25:37,640 --> 02:25:38,580
Keep going.

2061
02:25:38,820 --> 02:25:39,260
Keep going.

2062
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:40,080
Keep going!

2063
02:25:58,910 --> 02:26:01,130
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

2064
02:26:04,150 --> 02:26:05,650
We hit a mine.

2065
02:26:06,910 --> 02:26:07,430
Free.

2066
02:26:08,890 --> 02:26:10,330
Why is there a...

2067
02:26:10,950 --> 02:26:11,990
Or in Deep Slate.

2068
02:26:12,570 --> 02:26:15,350
Why is there a emote that just says free?

2069
02:26:19,350 --> 02:26:20,910
Thank you guys for the super chest.

2070
02:26:21,230 --> 02:26:21,350
Thank you.

2071
02:26:24,150 --> 02:26:27,370
I don't know why you guys are always spoiling me.

2072
02:26:29,690 --> 02:26:31,330
I just want to...

2073
02:26:34,710 --> 02:26:36,030
If I don't...

2074
02:26:39,650 --> 02:26:41,630

2075
02:26:41,950 --> 02:26:42,150
Oh!

02:26:42,670 --> 02:26:43,510
There's the hole!

2077
02:26:44,210 --> 02:26:45,170
Can you guys see anything?

2078
02:26:46,350 --> 02:26:47,150
Do you have food?

2079
02:26:47,330 --> 02:26:48,790
No, we're here to die, baby.

2080
02:26:52,130 --> 02:26:53,410
But I hear lava.

2081
02:26:56,490 --> 02:26:57,910
You could make torches.

2082
02:26:58,290 --> 02:26:58,850
You're right!

2083
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:07,960
You're still right.

2084
02:27:08,320 --> 02:27:08,920
There we go.

2085
02:27:09,360 --> 02:27:10,080
Now I can see.

2086
02:27:12,460 --> 02:27:13,320

Okay, here we go.

02:28:29,550 --> 02:28:30,710

Spooked me for a second.

2099
02:28:34,630 --> 02:28:35,310
I thought it was lava.

2100
02:28:35,470 --> 02:28:36,290
I thought we were about to die.

2101
02:28:37,190 --> 02:28:38,150
When will we die?

2102
02:28:39,830 --> 02:28:40,270
Oh.

2103
02:28:42,850 --> 02:28:44,650
When will we die?

2104
02:28:44,850 --> 02:28:46,530
Cardamal, thank you for the 50!

2105
02:28:49,770 --> 02:28:53,270
Turns out the 20th is free.

2106
02:28:54,930 --> 02:28:55,090
Oh!

2107
02:28:56,030 --> 02:28:56,530
Uh-oh.

2108
02:28:57,970 --> 02:28:59,270
Wait, but I'm supposed to die.

2109
02:28:59,990 --> 02:29:00,490
Uh-oh.

2110
02:29:01,810 --> 02:29:02,590
Uh-oh.

2111
02:29:03,350 --> 02:29:04,890
Hold on, let's dig through here.

2112
02:29:06,270 --> 02:29:08,110
Into the lava beyond.

2113
02:29:11,950 --> 02:29:12,470
S8101010.

2114
02:29:13,770 --> 02:29:14,850
It's not free.

2115
02:29:15,070 --> 02:29:16,050
It's definitely not free.

2116
02:29:19,710 --> 02:29:20,270
What?

2117
02:29:23,930 --> 02:29:27,870
I just got the weirdest notification.

2118
02:29:31,010 --> 02:29:31,310
Oh, wait.

2119
02:29:32,630 --> 02:29:34,270
Oh, I wonder.

2120
02:29:34,370 --> 02:29:35,470
Hold on.

2121
02:29:38,570 --> 02:29:39,130
You...

2122
02:29:39,730 --> 02:29:42,190
Oh, interesting.

2123
02:29:43,030 --> 02:29:44,170
I just got a notification.

2124
02:29:44,690 --> 02:29:47,090
Okay, so this stream will probably not be monetized.

2125
02:29:47,490 --> 02:29:49,250
Because it says we just got...

2126
02:29:49,250 --> 02:29:52,650
We just detected audio in your stream belonging to someone
else.

2127
02:29:52,950 --> 02:29:54,630
And your stream might be blocked.

2128
02:29:55,050 --> 02:29:56,810
No, don't block my stream.

2129
02:29:58,930 --> 02:29:59,530
Please.

2130
02:30:01,630 --> 02:30:02,090
YouTube.

2131
02:30:03,590 --> 02:30:04,910
I'll turn down the jazz.

2132
02:30:05,290 --> 02:30:06,970
Is that what's going to do it?

2133
02:30:08,210 --> 02:30:09,750
Not the jazz.

2134
02:30:12,910 --> 02:30:14,650
Not the jazz.

2135
02:30:14,690 --> 02:30:25,190

workbench with you you're probably right how is it so hard

2143
02:31:34,180 --> 02:31:35,800
Valentine, thank you for the birthday!

2144
02:31:37,140 --> 02:31:38,840
Oh, I hear the lava.

2145
02:31:49,220 --> 02:31:50,580
This way.

2146
02:31:58,380 --> 02:31:59,020
Forward.

2147
02:32:02,360 --> 02:32:02,880
Oh!

2148
02:32:03,700 --> 02:32:05,020
Oh, that was weird.

2149
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:07,700
Come on.

2150
02:32:08,620 --> 02:32:09,900
Death said no.

2151
02:32:11,480 --> 02:32:14,600
It was so easy for me to die before and become a ghost.

2152
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:17,960
I hear it.

2153
02:32:19,620 --> 02:32:22,640
Wait, did that drip?

2154
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:27,140
No.

2155
02:32:32,060 --> 02:32:35,220
This is making me nostalgic.

2156
02:32:37,360 --> 02:32:38,060
For what?

2157
02:32:41,900 --> 02:32:52,560
I wanted to kind of discover like a cool place but dying the
lava I guess is okay too you know if I die I can't oh lava

2158
02:32:52,560 --> 02:33:04,900
popping here oh there's a bat there's a bat oh the bat just

2159
02:33:04,900 --> 02:33:12,660
burned the lava lava popping wait what nothing Puddy Puddy
Caves?

2160
02:33:15,320 --> 02:33:17,120
Don't say that!

2161
02:33:17,880 --> 02:33:18,540
Goodbye, Bat.

2162
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:19,900
She died once.

2163
02:33:20,080 --> 02:33:21,140
She can't die twice.

2164
02:33:22,760 --> 02:33:25,360
The lava is literally around us.

2165
02:33:30,150 --> 02:33:30,770
Please.

2166
02:33:32,750 --> 02:33:33,550
Please!

2167
02:33:35,130 --> 02:33:36,430
Where are you?

2168
02:33:48,260 --> 02:33:50,340
Have you tried slash kill?

2169
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:54,020
I don't have cheats on.

2170
02:33:54,100 --> 02:33:54,500
I don't think...

2171
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:54,940
Can you...

2172
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:56,240
Slash kill?

2173
02:34:04,650 --> 02:34:05,590
Keep digging.

2174
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:09,880
We'll get there.

2175
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:11,660
We'll get to an opening.

2176
02:34:14,460 --> 02:34:16,520
Lava popping, bats are screeching!

2177
02:34:19,260 --> 02:34:21,660
Why is it so hard to die in this game?

2178
02:34:24,840 --> 02:34:26,200
Is it a buffy?

2179
02:34:28,560 --> 02:34:30,440
That sounds right next to me.

2180
02:34:32,020 --> 02:34:34,060
The next block I break will be it.

2181
02:34:35,540 --> 02:34:36,420
Oh my god.

2182
02:34:46,830 --> 02:34:47,630
Where's the lava?

2183
02:34:57,260 --> 02:34:58,940
I don't want to die to a skelly.

2184
02:35:00,340 --> 02:35:01,860
I don't want to die to your dumbass.

2185
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:03,260
Oh, diamond.

2186
02:35:07,580 --> 02:35:09,600
At least we get diamond before we die!

2187
02:35:15,890 --> 02:35:16,530
Did it glitch?

2188
02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:42,560
That's the wrong axe.

2189
02:35:43,780 --> 02:35:45,560
I didn't even think about it.

2190
02:35:46,720 --> 02:35:54,000
Because I just always have Like a diamond or iron At least
an iron egg I just always

2191
02:36:05,800 --> 02:36:10,370
You know what Okay, Skelly, man You can get me

There it is.

2196
02:37:04,910 --> 02:37:05,150
Ah!

2197
02:37:07,670 --> 02:37:08,930
That was silly.

2198
02:37:11,270 --> 02:37:13,870
In the end, we kind of build a maid cafe.

2199
02:37:14,570 --> 02:37:16,050
And we kind of...

2200
02:37:16,050 --> 02:37:17,530
No, not at all.

2201
02:37:17,690 --> 02:37:19,070
We did find the cherry blossoms.

2202
02:37:19,390 --> 02:37:21,430
But we did kind of build a maid cafe.

2203
02:37:23,130 --> 02:37:23,510
Well,

2204
02:37:27,500 --> 02:37:29,140
it was a pretty useless Minecraft.

2205
02:37:31,820 --> 02:37:32,300
Yummy!

2206
02:37:32,760 --> 02:37:33,500
Welcome to bamboo ship.

2207
02:37:33,920 --> 02:37:34,420
Thank you!

2208
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:35,780
Thank you, thank you.

2209
02:37:36,900 --> 02:37:39,220
We've detected audio in your stream belonging to something.

2210
02:37:39,300 --> 02:37:44,860
You guys, if this stream gets blocked, I'm so, because of my
jazz, I'm so sorry.

2211
02:37:45,940 --> 02:37:49,560
If it gets blocked because of my jazz, I am so sorry.

2212
02:37:56,220 --> 02:37:58,800
I thought it'd be fine, but it's okay.

2213
02:38:00,220 --> 02:38:02,500
If it just gets demonetized, then it's whatever.

2214
02:38:03,720 --> 02:38:05,440
I hope you can join the B-Shoujo server.

2215
02:38:06,780 --> 02:38:11,180
I will hopefully have someone to guide me around.

2216
02:38:14,140 --> 02:38:15,560
And I don't know.

2217
02:38:15,720 --> 02:38:17,600
Any other servers I can join, we'll see.

2218
02:38:19,740 --> 02:38:21,520
YouTube does not like jazz.

2219
02:38:22,200 --> 02:38:23,560
Not like jazz.

2220
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:27,620
It's so sad.

2221
02:38:28,020 --> 02:38:29,620
Haven't they...

2222
02:38:31,420 --> 02:38:33,120
Haven't they watched a B-movie?

2223
02:38:37,780 --> 02:38:40,720
The cat is finally suing you for all the...

2224
02:38:41,980 --> 02:38:42,380
Huh?

2225
02:38:45,060 --> 02:38:46,920
My eyes go kind of crazy when I do that.

2226
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:47,560
Huh?

2227
02:38:50,240 --> 02:38:51,640
That's like the, what's it called?

2228
02:38:52,200 --> 02:38:54,580
I've seen that girl that does like the...

2229
02:38:54,580 --> 02:38:55,860
No Chick-fil-A sauce?

2230
02:38:56,480 --> 02:38:57,820
That's how I feel when I did that.

2231
02:38:59,780 --> 02:39:02,140
If you don't know what that is, don't worry about it.

2232
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:07,540
We do the noise so well.

2233
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:08,360
Thank you.

2234
02:39:09,740 --> 02:39:10,160
Huh?

2235
02:39:11,480 --> 02:39:11,960
Huh?

2236
02:39:17,080 --> 02:39:20,220
Well, guys, I'm going to go eat dinner, actually.

2237
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:24,620
Thank you for letting...

2238
02:39:24,620 --> 02:39:25,640
Thank you for...

2239
02:39:25,640 --> 02:39:30,960
You know, always thank you for letting me just kind of
indulge myself with the dumb things that I like.

2240
02:39:31,920 --> 02:39:33,700
You guys let me do stupid Minecraft.

2241
02:39:33,720 --> 02:39:42,460
even when it's just me going on a boat listening to jazz and
going through the night and doing nothing i really you guys

2242
02:39:42,460 --> 02:39:58,280
are here for no reason but i really appreciate it regardless
um we love dumb things i know sometimes um like people will

2243
02:39:58,280 --> 02:40:09,400
be like in minecraft they just like they they don't in it
and that was truly this stream so like sometimes people will

2244
02:40:09,400 --> 02:40:15,180
just play Minecraft and just run around and jump and like
just look at stuff but they never do anything and that was

2245
02:40:15,180 --> 02:40:26,100
truly this stream but I appreciate you guys watching
regardless even though I wasn't building anything or but

2246
02:40:26,100 --> 02:40:35,320
this was my first time like getting into Minecraft in a long
time so It was kind of just nice to...

2247
02:40:35,320 --> 02:40:37,760
And I got to see the armadillos and the new wolves.

2248
02:40:37,900 --> 02:40:39,180
So that was good.

2249
02:40:40,040 --> 02:40:40,800
That was good.

2250
02:40:41,460 --> 02:40:42,720
Here for the bits and banter.

2251
02:40:43,580 --> 02:40:45,620
Literally here for your doing nothing antics.

2252
02:40:45,780 --> 02:40:46,720
I appreciate it.

2253
02:40:49,060 --> 02:40:50,580
I really appreciate it.

2254
02:40:50,880 --> 02:40:53,660
I don't deserve it.

2255
02:40:53,880 --> 02:40:57,200
But I'm very, very, very appreciative.

2256
02:40:57,780 --> 02:40:58,860
Thank you, guys.

2257
02:41:00,280 --> 02:41:00,720
Tomorrow.

2258
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:03,140
We are not doing nothing.

2259
02:41:03,720 --> 02:41:06,200
we are being awesome and cool as hell.

2260
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:07,820
Tomorrow we are.

2261
02:41:08,560 --> 02:41:09,540
We are.

2262
02:41:09,880 --> 02:41:12,380
We are on the cruise.

2263
02:41:14,900 --> 02:41:15,500
Tomorrow.

2264
02:41:19,150 --> 02:41:19,830
Oh.

2265
02:41:22,710 --> 02:41:24,610
Tomorrow we're being cool.

2266
02:41:26,210 --> 02:41:26,230
Tomorrow.

2267
02:41:28,850 --> 02:41:29,570
Tomorrow.

2268
02:41:30,550 --> 02:41:32,570
Tomorrow we're being awesome.

2269
02:41:33,950 --> 02:41:39,710
Um, oh my goodness, I'm looking at the stream labs now.

2270
02:41:39,850 --> 02:41:41,490
What about stream labs ones, though?

2271
02:41:41,750 --> 02:41:42,590
Surely those are free.

2272
02:41:43,290 --> 02:41:43,390
No!

2273
02:41:44,170 --> 02:41:45,550
Built a maid cafe and died.

2274
02:41:45,730 --> 02:41:47,510
This is secretly a mint lore stream.

2275
02:41:51,410 --> 02:41:55,950
Tomorrow we're being radical and awesome and cool and, um,

2276
02:41:59,790 --> 02:42:00,830

Bye-bye.

2288
02:43:33,470 --> 02:43:37,170
Wait, I think my mic might be on because I had to change mic
stuff.

02:43:37,690 --> 02:43:42,070
So if you hear me when I do the outro, no, you don't.
