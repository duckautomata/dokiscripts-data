1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,580
Ba ba ba ba...

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,190
Did it work?

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,350
Did it work?

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,810
Hello?

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:18,590
Hello?

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:20,790
It worked?

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,170
Are we good?

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:26,860
Hello?

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:27,680
It worked?

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,020
I am vertical?

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,500
It worked!

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,700
Hate the snow!

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,040
I... uh... I don't know.

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,100
I was trying to... I forgot... I forgot something.

15
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,820
I'm tall.

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,680
No, let me... pretend that we're... that I didn't forget.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,160
I didn't forget anything.

18
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,760
Okay.

19
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,790
Okay.

20
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,210
She hates us vertically.

21
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,070
What?

22
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,520
No.

23
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,360
Where's the tweet?

24
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,380
I tweeted it.

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,880
It went through, right?

26
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:32,880
Oh gosh.

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,000
Is anything working?

28
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,940
Yeah, it worked.

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,140
We're fine.

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh my gosh.

31
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,120
Everything's fine.

32
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,240
I think.

33
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,580
Let me check on my phone.

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,500
Let me check on my phone.

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh no, I was watching...

36
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,300
Silly TikTok.

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,840
Phone.

38
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:05,900
Me.

39
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,680
View channel.

40
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,960
I'm there.

41
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,580
Oh my gosh.

42
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,260
Sure, silly TikTok.

43
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,340
Yeah, you wanna hear it?

44
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,560
You wanna hear it?

45
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,040
My favorite genre of TikTok.

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,360
Hold on.

47
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:36,840
Yeah!

48
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,830
Oh my gosh.

49
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,750
I'm not feeling so awesome.

50
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,210
Here you are.

51
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,190
Have my awesomes.

52
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,190
Says the awesomes man.

53
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,390
Heartwarming stories.

54
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,510
Try not to smile.

55
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,830
Have my awesomes, man.

56
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:12,470
No!

57
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,110
You have my awesomes.

58
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,350
Says the awesomes man.

59
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:22,930
Wow.

60
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,610
I feel so good.

61
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,210
I feel so good now.

62
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,210
Here you go.

63
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,950
Have my awesomes.

64
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:30,250
No!

65
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,610
You have my awesomes.

66
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,310
You have my awesomes.

67
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,490
Thank you for 7 months of awesomes.

68
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,030
Wow!

69
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,230
Thank you.

70
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,490
Oh!

71
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:46,990
Thank you, Harpy!

72
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,550
Wait.

73
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,630
Thank you so much for the Akudono!

74
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,310
Vertical Minky.

75
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:54,390
No!

76
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,430
I hope I set it up right.

77
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,070
I added a new dono sound.

78
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,650
But it's a Minky.

79
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,610
I don't know if I set it up right.

80
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,120
I'm not feeling so Minky today.

81
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:15,900
Here.

82
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,980
Have my Minky.

83
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,700
Says the Minky's guy.

84
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,380
The Minky's man.

85
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,580
Let me see if I set it up right.

86
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,980
And then we'll start singing.

87
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,580
Today is just chill songs only.

88
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,580
Kind of vibes.

89
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,700
Which is why we're in this very beautiful, very relaxing...

90
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,920
Field O' Flower.

91
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,220
Whatever kind of flower this is.

92
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,660
I don't know.

93
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,080
It is a flower field.

94
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,680
Hold on.

95
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,280
Minky.

96
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,470
Did I do it right?

97
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,440
Minky rule.

98
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,500
Oh, sorry.

99
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,340
It's for only...

100
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,160
I feel so bad.

101
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,320
I feel so bad when I'm like, oh, sorry.

102
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,780
It's only for a certain amount.

103
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,280
I'm sorry!

104
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,240
Wait, hold on though.

105
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,460
Maybe I can't do...

106
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,160
Maybe I can't do it randomly.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,320
If it's a certain amount.

108
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,110
Maybe I have to get rid of SpongeBob.

109
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,010
Maybe I have to get rid of SpongeBob.

110
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,750
I don't know.

111
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,430
I don't know anything.

112
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,070
I don't know anything.

113
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,970
I just wanted to add the Minky.

114
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,370
What if I do this?

115
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,030
What if I do this?

116
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:04,270
Okay.

117
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:04,350
Okay.

118
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,860
Maybe I'll set it for this much.

119
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,160
I'll lower it.

120
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,760
I'll lower it.

121
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,840
There, I lowered it.

122
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,500
Okay.

123
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,060
There we go.

124
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,660
Thank you, Luffy!

125
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,080
Thank you so much for the...

126
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,820
I don't know.

127
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,460
Why are you apologizing?

128
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,020
Why are you apologizing?

129
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,080
Hi, Mito.

130
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:36,620
Hello!

131
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,820
Hello!

132
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,440
Hello!

133
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,060
Seven months already?

134
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,620
Oh my gosh!

135
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,280
Mel-chan, thank you!

136
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,600
I don't have so much of a set list today.

137
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,260
Just kind of vibing.

138
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,300
I don't know.

139
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,500
I, like, had a crazy dream last night and it made me just want to rest today.

140
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,780
Have you guys ever had that?

141
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,260
In my dream, I went to a convention and then I went to a show.

142
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:15,140
But the show was based off of a childhood movie that I liked, but they completely got it wrong.

143
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,600
And I was like, what's going on?

144
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,400
But then I was being transported in and out of the show.

145
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
And also the...

146
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,420
The...

147
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,260
Me watching the performance, but then I was also in the performance.

148
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,920
And I was, like, going crazy.

149
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,640
They got it wrong.

150
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,880
Yeah, I was like, I don't remember this part from the movie.

151
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,460
I was upset.

152
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,380
I've had this exact same dream.

153
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,320
Are you Mito?

154
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,600
Are you Mito?

155
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,000
Hot dog.

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,420
Hot dog.

157
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,600
I'm not feeling so yataiga.

158
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,360
Here, have my yataiga.

159
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,860
Said the yataiga's man.

160
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,580
Thanks, Ashes.

161
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,460
I woke up exhausted from what I dreamt.

162
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,880
Isn't that the worst, though?

163
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,740
When you just have a dream and it doesn't...

164
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:11,420
It makes you more tired because you're so active in the dream that you're just like...

165
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,420
So I thought...

166
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,340
Maybe I'll just chill today.

167
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,600
Chill Sunday.

168
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,640
And maybe we can...

169
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:28,420
Maybe we can have things chill and then have a good start to the week.

170
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,580
Maybe.

171
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,680
Maybe, maybe.

172
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,040
Work dreams.

173
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,560
It wasn't a work dream, though.

174
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,430
Just a...

175
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,180
Just an all-over-the-place kind of dream.

176
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,960
I'm a busy, busy bee dream, you know?

177
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,440
I'm just like...

178
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,900
I'm doing so much.

179
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,180
If anyone wants the OG chat...

180
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,680
I have the OG chat.

181
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,300
What is that?

182
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,480
Next Vtuber anime in another world with my Vtuber idol ghost and Mito V8.

183
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,620
What?

184
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:11,420
Wait.

185
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,630
OG chat.

186
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,550
Is the chat different?

187
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:30,670
In chat...

188
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,270
Is chat in shorts format or is it just me?

189
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,010
There's a different chat format?

190
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,710
That's so strange.

191
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,330
My restless dreams.

192
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,570
I see her streams.

193
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,270
For mobile.

194
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,510
Maybe.

195
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,950
It's like over top of me.

196
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,530
Should I move?

197
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,190
Do I move up?

198
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,170
Do I get smaller?

199
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,330
Where do you want me?

200
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,190
Go far back.

201
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,410
Hello, hello, hello.

202
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,910
It's me.

203
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,390
All the way back here.

204
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,350
Can you hear me?

205
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,510
Take the mic.

206
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,870
It doesn't get any smaller.

207
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,590
It's a really big mic.

208
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,730
It's cut off.

209
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,860
I need better acoustics.

210
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:49,860
Sticks.

211
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,630
Maybe like this.

212
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,830
Is this better?

213
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,210
Is this better?

214
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,940
This makes me look tall.

215
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,600
For the first time in my afterlife.

216
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,840
It's the ahoge.

217
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,920
Probably.

218
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,200
I will sing now.

219
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,380
I will take requests asterisk.

220
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,140
I will see if anybody says something.

221
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,080
That I recognize.

222
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,520
I saw some people suggest things in pre-chat.

223
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,280
And I was like, oh.

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,080
This could be good.

225
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,380
And then I also saw things in pre-chat.

226
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,980
And I was like, do you understand what chill stream means?

227
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,200
Do you understand?

228
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
And...

229
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:36,170
Oh my gosh!

230
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,870
Thank you!

231
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,210
You sent too much though.

232
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,970
Thank you for the...

233
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,990
Oh no, thank you.

234
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,890
You sent too much.

235
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:47,850
It's okay, it's okay.

236
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,630
So funny.

237
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,330
Worth every cent.

238
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:09,830
Stop!

239
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,230
The first minky.

240
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,090
Time to set minky original as my ringtone.

241
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,350
Anyway.

242
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,190
So yeah, I have some songs.

243
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,630
And then...

244
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,590
Nominated here for Lude-Tuber of the Year.

245
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:46,850
Why?

246
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,200
I'm confused.

247
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,740
Okay, I'm gonna sing.

248
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,660
I don't know what to start with.

249
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,340
Oh gosh.

250
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,730
Maybe because I didn't really plan for karaoke, I feel like I'm in...

251
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,700
Wait, I'm gonna move my mic up a little.

252
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,220
I feel like I'm in a weird way with it.

253
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,400
Because I'm like, what do I start with?

254
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,420
Fly me to the moon?

255
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,140
I guess we can do that.

256
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,000
Hi, dog.

257
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,180
Hi, dog.

258
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,740
Well, I should maybe turn off sound.

259
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,920
I added a sound, but maybe I should turn them off.

260
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,680
Minky, can you sing me happy birthday to my little sister?

261
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,320
She's turning six years old and her name is Janie.

262
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,280
Last year my oshi wished her a happy birthday, so I would love to keep the tradition going.

263
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,640
Good timing, oh my gosh.

264
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,380
Of course, Eevee, I could sing.

265
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,400
Thank you, ducky.

266
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,960
Life-size Minto.

267
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,300
Happy birthday to you.

268
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,800
Happy birthday to you.

269
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,140
Happy birthday, dear Janie.

270
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,040
Happy birthday to you.

271
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,060
Six years old.

272
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,260
Baby.

273
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:12,520
Baby.

274
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,060
I hope all your birthday wishes come true.

275
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,260
Give me a second, I'm going to turn off stream lab sounds real quick.

276
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,140
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,880
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

278
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,600
Wait, how do I turn them down?

279
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,580
They changed the back end, so everything is really different.

280
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,320
I'm not quite sure how to turn them off.

281
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,160
You know what?

282
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,380
Just don't stream lab, okay guys?

283
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,300
I don't know how to turn them off.

284
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,780
Let's do... this says slow version.

285
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,460
I'll do slow version.

286
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,140
Sing Snake Eater.

287
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,560
Of course I have to sing Snake Eater, but I found a different version of Snake Eater.

288
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,640
Of course I have to sing it on the 20th anniversary, which is today.

289
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,200
Have to.

290
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,750
I wonder how this one is going to sound.

291
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:10,810
It's a slow version.

292
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,310
Morning.

293
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,050
Oh.

294
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,860
Oh, to the moon.

295
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:36,620
What

296
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,090
is this?

297
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:42,870
What is it?

298
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,310
Hold on.

299
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,230
Okay.

300
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,650
It's kind of high.

301
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,670
I'll start it over.

302
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,110
That was a test.

303
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:57,690
That was a test.

304
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:49,220
And let me play among the stars Let me see what spring is like On Jupiter and Mars In other words Hold my hand.

305
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,720
In other words,

306
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,830
kiss me.

307
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:10,730
Fill my heart with song.

308
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:19,390
And let me sing forevermore.

309
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,650
You are all I long for.

310
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:31,510
All I worship and adore.

311
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,540
Please be true.

312
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:56,860
In other words, I love you.

313
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,980
Fill

314
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,250
my heart with song.

315
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:14,250
And let me play among the stars.

316
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,770
This is not the right words.

317
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:21,530
You are all I long for.

318
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:28,910
All I worship and adore.

319
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:39,710
In other words, please be true.

320
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,350
In other words...

321
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,890
Oh gosh, sorry, I didn't warm up before this.

322
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:58,150
I love you.

323
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,040
That was my warm up song.

324
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,240
I felt it coming even.

325
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,380
I was like, I don't think I'm gonna hit this note.

326
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,460
I felt it coming.

327
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,820
My bad.

328
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,580
Okay, that was a warm up.

329
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
Don't think about that.

330
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,120
That's not how I actually sing, guys.

331
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,680
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

332
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,080
I was like, why is she singing karaoke?

333
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,320
She can't even sing.

334
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,160
Oh my god, so embarrassing.

335
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,320
I'm not a professional, you guys!

336
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,300
Let's see.

337
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,020
Thank you for the superchats.

338
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,140
Thank you for the 20 gifts.

339
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,740
Thank you, thank you.

340
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,820
Phantom thief voice crashed the hell up.

341
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,860
Don't jinx me.

342
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,600
Get it?

343
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,860
Because your name is Jinx.

344
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,120
I said, don't jinx me.

345
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,620
Also, I'm gonna sing Japanese, English songs.

346
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,240
Kind of just whatever I feel like.

347
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,000
So, anything is good.

348
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,680
But only chill songs.

349
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,220
Only chill songs today.

350
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:34,980
Okay?

351
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,020
Okay.

352
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,960
Only chill stuff.

353
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,340
I have a list.

354
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,340
Let me see.

355
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,580
Someone requested this one.

356
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,460
I think I can do this one.

357
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:50,620
Ouch.

358
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,100
Oh no.

359
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:51,960
Oh my god.

360
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:52,840
No.

361
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,640
My foot has pins and needles.

362
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,120
Ouch.

363
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,000
Oh my gosh.

364
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,000
Do you guys get the pins and needles?

365
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,180
When it falls...

366
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,080
Oh my god.

367
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,360
Massaging my foot.

368
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,380
I'm massaging my foot.

369
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,840
I'm massaging my foot.

370
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,560
I love that song.

371
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,500
I'll add it to the list.

372
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,420
That's wonderful.

373
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,840
Medic.

374
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,460
Massaging my foot.

375
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,820
I'm massaging my foot.

376
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,880
I like to stomp around whenever that happens.

377
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,040
I saw someone say life.

378
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,500
But I have a song actually.

379
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,820
I'm gonna try it.

380
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,740
This is another warm up song because I've never sung it before.

381
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,320
So...

382
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,160
Wait, do they have it?

383
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,180
Hold on.

384
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,340
Let me see if this is the song.

385
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,220
Let me see if this is the song.

386
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,300
I think it is.

387
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,230
It's loading.

388
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:10,830
Hold on.

389
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,230
You can't hear it, but I can hear it.

390
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,530
I can hear it.

391
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,670
I think so.

392
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,350
Yes, this is it.

393
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,910
I gotta let my foot not fall asleep again.

394
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,960
It keeps cutting off.

395
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,620
I keep having to squish it.

396
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,590
And left over pie.

397
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,690
It's no wonder.

398
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,290
Oh wait, what?

399
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,370
Wonder why.

400
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:20,970
Still you take up all of my mind.

401
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,680
Even think that you can.

402
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,800
I should stop.

403
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:35,120
Heaven knows I've tried.

404
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,000
I

405
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:51,920
will stop falling in love with you.

406
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:03,540
Someday, someone will like me like I like you.

407
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:11,070
Until then I'll drink my coffee, eat my pie.

408
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,550
And pretend that we are more than

409
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,740
friends.

410
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:26,320
Then of course I'll let you break my heart again.

411
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:37,040
I'm just trying to understand.

412
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,960
I am to you more than songs we've exchanged.

413
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:54,520
Midnight calls, sunset views.

414
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,560
Promise

415
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,490
I don't mean to cry.

416
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:16,260
I'm confused if only you knew what I...

417
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:34,830
I will stop falling in love with you.

418
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:46,450
Someday, someone will like me like I like you.

419
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:53,370
Until then I'll drink my coffee, eat my pie.

420
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:59,270
And pretend that we are more than friends.

421
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,970
Then of course I'll let you break my

422
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,160
heart again.

423
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,040
Someday,

424
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,780
I will stop falling in love.

425
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:40,450
Until I do be thinking of you.

426
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:49,350
Let you break my heart again.

427
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,520
Yay!

428
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,400
That was let you break my heart again.

429
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,660
By Liferay.

430
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,080
Sorry I messed up a little bit in the middle.

431
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,020
Maybe I'll do it again later as a revenge.

432
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,890
I'll do it again later as a revenge or something since I messed up that one part.

433
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:25,250
Sorry.

434
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,230
I'm still warming up.

435
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,790
I'm still warming up.

436
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,250
Loveliest ghost in the world?

437
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,010
Misty?

438
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,150
Yeah, I can do a Misty.

439
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:46,230
Misty, Misty, Misty.

440
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,050
Misty.

441
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:52,110
If singing is part of your job, does that mean you're literally a professional?

442
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,210
It's not mandatory.

443
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,490
Any chance for Cupid?

444
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,850
I actually have it on the list.

445
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,350
There's a lot of songs that I've never sung before.

446
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,650
I can do that one too.

447
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:09,930
Yeah.

448
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,010
Okay.

449
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,900
Normalize calling repeating a song revenge rather than an encore?

450
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,180
But it's like different, right?

451
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,940
Because an encore is like...

452
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,480
It doesn't have to be the same song.

453
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,640
It's just, right?

454
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,100
It's like an encore of the show.

455
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,420
Right?

456
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,580
It's different, right?

457
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,660
Right?

458
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,380
It's different, I think.

459
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,780
Minto Karaoke on my birthday.

460
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,180
Squadala we're off.

461
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,920
Happy birthday!

462
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,160
Happy birthday to you.

463
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,520
Happy birthday to you.

464
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,440
Happy birthday Squadala we're off.

465
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,820
Happy birthday to you.

466
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,120
Happy birthday!

467
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,600
Squadala...

468
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,500
Squad...

469
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:22,980
Sco...

470
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,700
Squad...

471
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,180
Sco...

472
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,260
Scooty.

473
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,100
Scooty.

474
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,220
Misty.

475
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,580
By Ella Fitzgerald.

476
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,560
For the Ocarina of Time, thank you!

477
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,420
I'm sorry, I don't know anything past Final Fantasy X.

478
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,880
Look at me.

479
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:06,400
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree.

480
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:12,300
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud.

481
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,980
I can't understand.

482
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,740
I get misty.

483
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:25,260
Just holding your hand.

484
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:31,180
Walk my way.

485
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:39,540
And a thousand violins begin to play.

486
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,320
Or it might be the sound of your hello.

487
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,980
That music I hear.

488
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,200
I get misty.

489
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,080
The moment you're near.

490
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:05,840
Can't you see that you're leading me on?

491
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:13,620
And it's just what I want you to do.

492
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:22,680
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost?

493
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,700
That's why I'm following you.

494
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,020
Through

495
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,790
this wonderland.

496
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,030
Hello.

497
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,710
My right foot from my left.

498
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:55,590
My hand from my glove.

499
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,990
I'm too misty.

500
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:03,950
And too much in love.

501
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,220
Misty.

502
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,630
In love.

503
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,490
Why did you guys have to say Too Minky?

504
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,710
Too Minky.

505
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,770
Thank you Sisa for the 15 gifted.

506
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:47,730
Thank you so much.

507
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,170
Thank you.

508
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,050
Thank you for the 5 gifted.

509
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,550
Too Minky.

510
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,950
Why are all these love songs though?

511
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,210
Maybe I can do one that's not a love song.

512
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,730
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

513
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,830
Karaoke on my birthday.

514
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,070
Cipher!

515
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,810
Wait, didn't I...

516
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:19,990
I sang happy birthday to you the other day, didn't I?

517
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,930
And there it goes, thanks for the 20 gifted!

518
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,070
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

519
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,490
Thank you.

520
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,570
Cipher's third birthday.

521
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,700
He said the 18th is his birthday.

522
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,180
Oh.

523
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,100
So like...

524
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,240
November 18th for you.

525
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,880
I definitely sang it for you like before.

526
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,060
Didn't I?

527
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,360
Or did I say that I was going to sing it to you on your birthday?

528
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,980
I did it.

529
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,560
I think I sang it before.

530
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,020
Let's go do a Japanese song.

531
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,320
Let's do some Nihongo.

532
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,040
Nihongo.

533
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,580
Nihongo, Nihongo.

534
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,160
I think I can sing this one...

535
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,380
I think I can sing this one original.

536
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,620
Original, I think so.

537
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,040
Hopefully it's not too loud, let's see.

538
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,460
Let's see.

539
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,130
I don't know.

540
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,310
I don't know.

541
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:24,330
I don't know.

542
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:25,710
I don't know.

543
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:18,800
When I was little, God was by my side He gave me love every day In the depths of my heart, I forgot how to see

544
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:45,880
Now is the time to open my precious box In the garden after the rain, if I'm wrapped in the gentleness of the scent of a flower

545
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,980
Everything I see with you is a message

546
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:25,800
In the garden after the rain, if I'm wrapped in the gentleness of the scent of a flower Everything I see with you is a message

547
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,670
Nice.

548
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,360
One second, you heard nothing?

549
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:54,040
Whenever I sang my songs, on the stage, on my own Whenever I said my words, wishing they would be heard I saw you smiling at me, was it real or just my fantasy?

550
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:45,800
You'd always be there in the corner of this tiny little bar My last night here for you Same old songs, just once more My last night here with you Maybe yes, maybe no I kind of liked it your way How you shyly placed your eyes on me But did you ever know that I had mine?

551
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,300
Oh

552
00:41:50,650 --> 00:42:15,830
darling, so there you are With that look on your face As if you're never hurt As if you're never down Shall I be the one for you?

553
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:32,350
Who pinches you softly but sure If frown is shown then I will know that you are no dreamer

554
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:41,350
I also wanna do Melodies of Life but...

555
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:50,030
I don't know if I remember it so much So we'll try it after We'll do a little bit of some video game songs

556
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:43,340
So let me come to you Close as I want to be Close enough for me To feel your heart beating fast And stay there as I whisper How I loved your peaceful eyes on me Did you ever know that I had mine on you?

557
00:43:44,920 --> 00:45:11,340
Darling, so share with me your love if you have enough Your tears if you're holding back Or pain if that's what it is How can I let you know I'm more than the dress and the voice Just reach me out then You will know that you are not dreaming Darling, so there you are With that look on your face As if you're never hurt As if you're never down Shall I be the one for you Who pinches you softly by the shoulder I promise you then I will know that you are no dreamer

558
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:40,410
There's like an outro music Oh my gosh, it's so funny the memes that are just like...

559
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,130
Oh my god.

560
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:44,810
What's his name?

561
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:46,570
Squallian.

562
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:48,930
Squallian, you're so handsome.

563
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:52,430
And then they show him like he was being a pixelated mess.

564
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,030
Beautiful, thank you!

565
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:57,570
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

566
00:45:58,730 --> 00:45:59,170
Squallian.

567
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,070
That's me.

568
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:04,790
Squall.

569
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:05,690
Squallian heart.

570
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:08,190
Thanks for making it.

571
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:09,670
Thank you.

572
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:11,110
Forgot I was listening to Minto.

573
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:11,850
What do you mean?

574
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:15,110
Going to Europe for a few months, I won't be able to watch.

575
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:16,130
No!

576
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:17,450
Snow Halation?

577
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:20,350
But it's not chill.

578
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,990
It's Snow Halation, it's chill out of the soul.

579
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:26,310
Cool and Create.

580
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,370
Does Cool and Create have any chill songs?

581
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:32,190
Song of the Broken.

582
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:36,650
Is it?

583
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:42,090
Maybe I can do like a piano version of Snow Halation.

584
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:48,590
Maybe I can do like a slow version of Snow Halation.

585
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:51,690
Maybe.

586
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,590
Let's try Melodies of Life.

587
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,690
Let me see if this one is good.

588
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:03,450
Oh my gosh.

589
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,410
Wait, maybe I can do this one.

590
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:09,630
Gosh, I think I don't remember the song at all, but it might hit me once I start.

591
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:15,910
Oh my gosh, this is so nostalgic.

592
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:19,550
Let me see if this one sounds okay though.

593
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:23,950
Oh no, it's the Japanese version.

594
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,050
No, I want the English version.

595
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:25,390
Sorry.

596
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:31,490
Okay, that should be fine.

597
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:34,350
One second.

598
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,130
Sorry, I'm getting the... There we go.

599
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:41,070
Oh my

600
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:52,220
gosh, this is the true test to see if I get copyright struck or not, I think.

601
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:21,230
Now I'm trying really hard to weave by picking up the pieces that remain.

602
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:30,990
Melodies of Life, Love's lost refrain.

603
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:39,430
Our paths they did cross, though I cannot say just why.

604
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:46,890
We met, we laughed, we held on fast, and then we said goodbye.

605
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:53,830
And who will hear the echoes of stories never told?

606
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:59,570
Let them ring out loud till they unfold.

607
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:14,470
In my dearest memories, I see you reaching out to me.

608
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:28,570
Though you're gone, I still believe that you can call out my name.

609
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:41,390
A voice from the past, joining yours and mine, adding up the layers of harmony.

610
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:49,850
And so it goes on and on.

611
00:49:51,290 --> 00:50:02,190
Melodies of life, to the sky beyond the flying birds.

612
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:07,550
Forever and beyond.

613
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:20,440
I've always wanted to sing this song, like, in one of the Final Fantasy concerts.

614
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,240
This one in Eyes On Me.

615
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,840
This is my resume.

616
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,140
This is my formal application.

617
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:55,690
So far and away, see the bird as it flies by.

618
00:50:55,690 --> 00:51:02,830
Gliding through the shadows of the clouds up in the sky.

619
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:09,870
I've laid my memories and dreams upon those wings.

620
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:17,630
Leave them now and see what tomorrow brings.

621
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:29,950
In your dearest memories, do you remember loving me?

622
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:43,590
Was it fate that brought us close and now leaves me, oh, leaves me behind?

623
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:57,370
A voice from the past, joining yours and mine, adding up the layers of harmony.

624
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:05,590
And so it goes on and on.

625
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:16,290
Melodies of life, to the sky beyond the flying birds.

626
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:21,910
Forever and on.

627
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:27,350
I should leave this lonely world behind.

628
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:32,770
Your voice will still remember our melody.

629
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:41,590
Now I know we'll carry on.

630
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:52,870
Melodies of life, come circle round and grow deep in our hearts.

631
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:58,470
As long as we remember.

632
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,060
Sorry, I messed up the ending a little bit.

633
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,380
Sorry, I messed up the ending a little bit.

634
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:20,380
My bad.

635
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:22,520
Yay!

636
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,980
Melodies of life.

637
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,000
Thanks man, I could die now.

638
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,520
Have I ever sung that one in karaoke before?

639
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:36,940
Not quite sure.

640
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,780
We may be freaks, but we are romantic freaks.

641
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:49,500
Oh my gosh, my freak can't be this much of a romantic.

642
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,880
Loved hearing this song, thank you for singing it.

643
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,520
Oh, this is old.

644
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:56,180
Thanks!

645
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,300
I think you were the one who typed it though, Nanodo.

646
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,360
I think I saw it in the pre-chat.

647
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:07,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

648
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:12,820
I've requested it a few times, but I've never sung it before.

649
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,480
Let's continue with some video game music.

650
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:27,380
This one might be kind of scuffed because it's not the original version.

651
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,880
And I've never sung this version before.

652
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,100
We'll see.

653
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,920
Takahashi Rie's version?

654
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,660
What, she has her own version?

655
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,200
She has her own version?

656
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,240
I'm going to listen to it later.

657
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:56,280
Takahashi Rie Chisana Koe no Uta Oh!

658
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,860
Was it...

659
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:59,260
Paul?

660
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,680
Did she sing it as Takagi-san?

661
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,120
When I look this up, everything is about Takagi-san.

662
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,780
Oh, it was fifth ending theme.

663
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,500
I don't know it.

664
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,780
I didn't finish Takagi-san.

665
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,340
Whoopsie.

666
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,000
I didn't finish it.

667
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,720
I'm going to try singing this though.

668
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,380
We'll see how this goes.

669
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,020
There we go.

670
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:54,470
When do I come in?

671
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:32,490
I'm melting to you What a fear in my heart But you're so supreme

672
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:42,030
I'd give my life Not for honor

673
00:56:49,580 --> 00:57:02,240
In my time, there'll be no one else.

674
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,380
Cry,

675
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:15,610
it's the way I fly to you.

676
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:29,450
I'm still in a dream, Snake Eater.

677
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,280
That's it.

678
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,120
Oh my god.

679
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,520
It was a short version.

680
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:44,020
It

681
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:51,550
was a short version.

682
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:58,070
Someday, you'll go through the rain.

683
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:04,850
The piano was by Laura Platt on YouTube.

684
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:07,950
The version only has 336 views.

685
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:15,370
So, if you liked the instrumental, go listen to Laura Platt's version.

686
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:17,870
Thank you for the beautiful singing.

687
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:18,350
Thank you!

688
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:20,670
Alex, it's your birthday!

689
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:21,990
You can get a Moe in my queue.

690
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:24,670
Of course.

691
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:29,910
Happy birthday to you.

692
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:33,010
Happy birthday to you.

693
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:36,890
Happy birthday, AlexSCG.

694
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:42,090
Happy birthday, MoeMoeQ.

695
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:48,130
Thank you!

696
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:49,870
Happy birthday!

697
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:52,670
Ducky, thanks for the 5 gifted.

698
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:54,490
Alright.

699
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:57,710
Oh, that's nice.

700
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,020
It's pretty chill, right?

701
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,880
How does it go?

702
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:15,440
Right?

703
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,560
I think I remember.

704
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,100
Thanks,

705
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:32,680
Huey.

706
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,120
Also, Reddy, thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

707
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:36,860
Thank you!

708
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,180
Huey, you threw off my vibe.

709
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:51,680
You should be on this boat.

710
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,700
You should be on this ladder.

711
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,960
I'm sorry, you threw off the maid's groove.

712
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:00,460
Sorry!

713
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,260
Okay.

714
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:04,680
Alright.

715
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:05,220
Restart.

716
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:05,760
Restart.

717
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,360
Restart.

718
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,320
Steak.

719
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:15,300
Steak Dane.

720
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:42,090
Oh

721
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:56,670
枯れこぼれた 柔らかい涙

722
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:13,210
素敵だね ふたり手を取り 歩けたなら

723
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:27,130
「Ikitai yo kimi no machi e ude no naka.

724
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:41,790
Sono mune karada azuke.

725
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:58,650
Yoi ni magine yume mi.」 Thanks for the red!

726
01:02:59,170 --> 01:02:59,470
Hello!

727
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:03,510
おかえりなさいませ。ご主人様、お嬢様。

728
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:08,410
It's a three minute break?

729
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:10,050
Oh my god, no way.

730
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,360
I'm mid-phantom.

731
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,660
I'm singing chill karaoke today.

732
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:23,960
Right now we're on like boomer... boomer game songs.

733
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:32,490
Three minute fifteen second break.

734
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:33,690
No way that's real.

735
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:34,190
Right?

736
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:34,950
That can't be real.

737
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:01,910
風は止まり言葉は優しい幻 雲は破れ明日は遠くの声

738
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:17,010
月がにじむ鏡を 流れた心 Tsuki ga nijimu kagami wo nagareta kokoro The moon blurs the mirror, the heart flows

739
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:29,750
星が揺れてこぼれた 隠せない涙 Hoshi ga yurete koboreta kakusenai namida The stars sway and spill, the tears I can't hide

740
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:48,780
素敵だね ふたり手を取り歩けたなら Suteki da ne futari te wo tori aruketa nara How wonderful it would be if we could walk hand in hand

741
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:56,220
行きたいよ 君の町へ Ikitai yo kimi no machi e I want to go to your town

742
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:17,800
腕のその顔 そっと触れて Ude no sono kao sotto furete Your face on my arm, I gently touch it.

743
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:28,540
朝に溶ける 夢見る Asa ni tokeru yume miru I dream of melting in the morning.

744
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:39,720
I feel like the audio is off on this one, I'm sorry.

745
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:40,960
Maybe it was fine.

746
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:51,810
Yeah!

747
01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:04,370
スーツギターで Thank you, guys!

748
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:05,170
Thank you, thank you!

749
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:11,150
Maybe we go back to English songs for a bit.

750
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:13,030
Rest my brain.

751
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,530
She sounds like an angel.

752
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,550
Stop it.

753
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:22,190
Boomer RPGs are like Dragon Quest III and Final Fantasy IV.

754
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:24,950
Final Fantasy X is still pretty dull.

755
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:28,710
Yeah.

756
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:29,490
Yeah.

757
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:32,730
Keep telling yourself that.

758
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:34,470
Yeah.

759
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:37,350
Yeah.

760
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:41,470
Yeah.

761
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:45,770
New model so far.

762
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:46,790
Oh my gosh!

763
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:47,810
Marikyu!

764
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:51,660
Thank you!

765
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:57,000
Thanks for dropping by!

766
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:03,780
Yeah.

767
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:05,100
What was I gonna sing?

768
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:05,840
Oh!

769
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,000
I know what I wanna sing.

770
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:18,630
This one.

771
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:20,050
I think.

772
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:21,910
Got any round table?

773
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:23,230
Let me be with you.

774
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:28,870
I think that song is a little too upbeat for the chill vibes.

775
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:31,350
We're going ultra chill tonight.

776
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,450
It's gotta be chill, chill.

777
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:34,710
The chilliest chill.

778
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:35,850
You gotta have a breeze.

779
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:37,450
It's cold chill.

780
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:40,430
It's gotta be chill.

781
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:42,810
Yeah.

782
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:45,850
Chill.

783
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:49,330
Maybe later.

784
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:50,090
I'll write it down.

785
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:57,490
If you were somehow able to, would you stream Metal Gear Assassin?

786
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:09,490
I... I'm so torn because I wanna play it so I can say that I've played every Metal Gear game but at the same time I'm like...

787
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:13,830
I'm not looking forward to it at all.

788
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:16,530
Okay, that's a lie.

789
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:19,490
I am looking forward to it a little bit but I'm just like...

790
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:21,650
I hate the gameplay.

791
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:24,830
But next week I am playing Ghost Babble.

792
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:27,110
On Saturday.

793
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,650
I'm playing Ghost Babble, so...

794
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:31,230
Dango, please?

795
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:32,070
Oh, I can do dango.

796
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:32,810
Daikazoku.

797
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:33,410
Dango.

798
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:35,050
Daikazoku.

799
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:36,170
Yeah.

800
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:40,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

801
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:44,270
I feel acid's gonna be a fight against backseaters.

802
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:46,170
Honestly, I don't even mind though.

803
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:48,270
Because...

804
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:49,770
Because...

805
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:53,510
Because I don't wanna think.

806
01:08:55,650 --> 01:09:01,350
I don't... I hate... I hate card... Like, things like that so much.

807
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:04,110
I'm so traumatized by Chain of Memories.

808
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,500
I'm traumatized by Chain of Memories, so...

809
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,800
Oh yeah, maybe Acid 2.

810
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:15,720
They didn't say people say to do Acid 2, right?

811
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,380
Here's my overdue membu tax.

812
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:19,960
Simple and clean.

813
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,060
I can do simple and clean.

814
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:24,480
Wait.

815
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,620
Simple and clean.

816
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,520
We just did... We just did suteki dane.

817
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,100
Maybe we stick with the video games.

818
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:36,660
Simple... Wait.

819
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,920
And clean karaoke.

820
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,020
Let's try this one.

821
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,380
Oh wait, which one should I do?

822
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,420
Oh wait, I wonder if it's actually on here.

823
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:45,820
Hold on.

824
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,800
Simple and clean.

825
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,080
Oh.

826
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,040
Yay, they have it.

827
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,300
Okay, I'll do this one.

828
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:28,630
It's hard to let it go

829
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:55,850
You're giving me Too many things Lately You're all I need You smiled at me And said Don't get me wrong, I love you.

830
01:10:56,210 --> 01:11:00,390
But does that mean I have to meet your father?

831
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:09,870
When we are older, you'll understand what I meant when I said no.

832
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:14,390
I don't think life is quite that simple.

833
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:25,570
When you walk away, you don't hear me say Please, oh baby, don't go.

834
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:32,670
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight.

835
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:36,770
It's hard to let it go.

836
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:41,210
So simple and clean.

837
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:57,070
The daily things like this and that and what is what That keep us all busy are confusing me.

838
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:06,770
That's when you came to me and said Wish I could prove I love you.

839
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:11,350
But does that mean I have to walk On water?

840
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:16,210
When we are older, you'll understand.

841
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:20,930
It's enough when I say so.

842
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:25,270
And maybe some things are that simple.

843
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:36,450
When you walk away, you don't hear me say Please, oh baby, don't go.

844
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:43,530
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight.

845
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:47,470
It's hard to let it go.

846
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:49,570
Hold me.

847
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:57,630
Whatever lies beyond this morning is a little later on.

848
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:04,730
Regardless of warnings, the future doesn't scare me at all.

849
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:09,110
Nothing's like before.

850
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:20,110
When you walk away, you don't hear me say Please, oh baby, don't go.

851
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:27,210
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight.

852
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:31,090
It's hard to let it go.

853
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:32,970
Hold me.

854
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:41,230
Whatever lies beyond this morning is a little later on.

855
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:49,670
Regardless of warnings, the future doesn't scare me at all.

856
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:52,950
Nothing's like before.

857
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:54,950
Hold me.

858
01:13:54,950 --> 01:14:03,070
Whatever lies beyond this morning is a little later on.

859
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:11,710
Regardless of warnings, the future doesn't scare me at all.

860
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:14,930
Nothing's like before.

861
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:16,270
Whoa.

862
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:05,780
Whoa.

863
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:11,020
Sorry, I messed up a part of it because I was typing simple and clean, but I thought I wrote simple and clear.

864
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:12,880
And I was like, wait, I think I wrote the wrong thing.

865
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:14,880
Yay.

866
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:21,970
Yeah, that was simple and clean.

867
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:24,390
From Kingdom Hearts.

868
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:28,570
Simple and clean.

869
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:30,770
Kingdom Hearts 3 song.

870
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:32,210
What's the one?

871
01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:33,070
Utata Hikaru.

872
01:15:33,190 --> 01:15:34,430
I wonder if it's on here.

873
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:38,390
Hikari?

874
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:47,850
Wait, I can't tell if the sanctuary one is the slow version or the fast version.

875
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:52,770
Face my fears.

876
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:54,470
Oh, that's the English one, right?

877
01:15:55,870 --> 01:15:59,770
Oh wait, maybe passion is the slow version of sanctuary.

878
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:01,990
Oh gosh, it's so confusing.

879
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:03,870
Oh wait, I'm thinking of Chikai.

880
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:05,670
Wait, face my fears is the...

881
01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:08,010
Wait, I'm getting all confused.

882
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:12,470
Face my fears is like the...

883
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:15,330
Is the fast one.

884
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:18,370
Okay, Hikari is simple and clean, but in Japanese.

885
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:24,370
Face my fears is the opening song of Kingdom Hearts 3.

886
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:35,530
Chikai, aka don't think twice, is the other song, the slow song of Kingdom Hearts 3.

887
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:37,590
And then sanctuary and passion are Kingdom Hearts 2.

888
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:38,350
Oh my gosh.

889
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:41,630
Oh gosh.

890
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:45,310
Also, also, also, extra...

891
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:48,110
Wait, Zekra, sorry.

892
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,110
Zekra, thank you so much for the Akasuma.

893
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:51,050
Thank you.

894
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:53,850
Thank you, thank you.

895
01:16:58,090 --> 01:16:59,570
Ironically, we need to think twice.

896
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:02,370
Yeah, I love don't think twice.

897
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:05,590
This may be probably one of my favorite songs from...

898
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:07,650
Even though simple and clean is so nostalgic.

899
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:10,450
I love don't think twice.

900
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:11,890
Well, I love Chikai.

901
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:15,330
I like both versions.

902
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:20,450
Which one is... Okay, let me try passion.

903
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:22,510
Is it passion or sanctuary?

904
01:17:22,990 --> 01:17:23,890
Let me try sanctuary.

905
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:24,850
Okay, hold on.

906
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:28,190
One of them is the slow version, right?

907
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:30,370
Oh gosh.

908
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:30,470
Oh gosh.

909
01:17:34,110 --> 01:17:35,250
Is it gonna get fast?

910
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,280
It's just Ian versus JP.

911
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:48,400
Does it get fast?

912
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:51,520
There's a slow version, though.

913
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:56,900
I think this is the fast version.

914
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,040
We can't ruin the vibe, guys.

915
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,600
We can't ruin the vibes, I'm sorry.

916
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,120
It's too fast.

917
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:02,820
It's too fast.

918
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:03,940
It's too fast.

919
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,600
I'll do don't think twice, then.

920
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,260
You're looking for passion.

921
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:15,780
Okay, so passion is the...

922
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:18,720
It's so confusing.

923
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,160
Sanctuary is after the battle is the slower version.

924
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:26,480
I'm just gonna skip forward in this.

925
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:27,420
You guys can't hear it.

926
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,140
End of a life by Cali.

927
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,820
I think I would have to practice it before I try it, though.

928
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:37,520
Oh, there we go.

929
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:40,820
No, sanctuary...

930
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:42,620
At least the one...

931
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:44,960
The passion they have on here is still very fast.

932
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:45,920
That's okay, though.

933
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:47,000
That's okay.

934
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:49,540
Where am I going?

935
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:50,040
Here.

936
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,000
Don't think twice.

937
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:55,400
Kingdom Hearts.

938
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:56,660
Karaoke.

939
01:18:58,260 --> 01:18:59,740
Let me make sure this one...

940
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:00,740
Don't think twice.

941
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:07,700
But I want the English version.

942
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,820
I guess we could do the Japanese version.

943
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:13,600
It's the same thing.

944
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:17,540
Hold on.

945
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:18,880
Sorry, I'm finding a good karaoke.

946
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:23,970
Okay, I found it.

947
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:28,390
Oh, it starts immediately.

948
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:28,690
Okay.

949
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:32,910
Okay, okay.

950
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,540
Don't think twice.

951
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,280
I'm not gonna do the Japanese version because...

952
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,220
It goes too fast.

953
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:44,160
In some parts.

954
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:57,710
Oh, this song makes me so emotional.

955
01:19:58,690 --> 01:20:00,070
It's so good, though.

956
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:29,780
No.

957
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:44,680
Sorry,

958
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:48,200
hold on.

959
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,220
I'm gonna find a different version.

960
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:50,580
The bass on this is insane.

961
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,600
I can't hear myself think.

962
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,460
My god.

963
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:56,360
It's like...

964
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,760
It's crazy.

965
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:02,360
The bass is crazy.

966
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:03,100
Okay, hold on.

967
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:03,980
Let me try this one instead.

968
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:05,600
I'm sorry.

969
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,580
I didn't think it would take that crap.

970
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:10,900
My subwoofer went nuts.

971
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:11,660
I'm sorry.

972
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:15,460
Weight of the world.

973
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,220
Weight of the world?

974
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:18,260
What's that one?

975
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,620
I'm checking to see if this karaoke is instead better.

976
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,700
No, why is it also so crazy?

977
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:36,340
Why?

978
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:40,530
Okay.

979
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:43,210
I'm scared of this one.

980
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:44,670
I'm scared that it's gonna be official.

981
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:49,350
I can't

982
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:56,860
tell.

983
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,340
Maybe it's okay.

984
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:00,960
Oh, it's near.

985
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:01,980
Sorry, I don't know.

986
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,300
I have not played near yet, so I do not know.

987
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:07,300
I have not played near yet.

988
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:10,160
Sorry, this one is gonna be...

989
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,980
This one might be also a little bassy.

990
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:15,840
I apologize in advance.

991
01:22:55,490 --> 01:22:59,530
Things they don't really mean.

992
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:02,190
Really mean.

993
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:07,130
You're only everything I ever dreamed.

994
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:10,830
Ever dreamed of.

995
01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:13,590
Ever dreamed of.

996
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:16,830
You must be kidding me.

997
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:21,270
Did you really think I could say no?

998
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:26,570
I want you for a lifetime.

999
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:30,410
So if you're gonna think twice.

1000
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:33,490
Baby, I don't wanna know.

1001
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:36,030
Baby, I don't wanna know.

1002
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:38,470
Everything is just right.

1003
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:41,510
But if you're gonna think twice.

1004
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:44,750
Baby, I don't wanna know.

1005
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:47,390
Baby, I don't wanna know.

1006
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:56,310
I really don't get what everyone else believes.

1007
01:23:58,350 --> 01:24:06,610
So why do I say things I don't really, really mean?

1008
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:09,590
Really mean.

1009
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:14,550
I'm only crying cause I never dreamed.

1010
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:17,550
It'd take this long.

1011
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:20,710
It'd take this long.

1012
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:22,690
I want you for a lifetime.

1013
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:26,170
So if you're gonna think twice.

1014
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:29,770
Baby, I don't wanna know.

1015
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:32,330
Baby, I don't wanna know.

1016
01:24:32,430 --> 01:24:34,770
Everything is just right.

1017
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:37,890
But if you're gonna think twice.

1018
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:40,970
Baby, I don't wanna know.

1019
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:43,610
Baby, I don't wanna know.

1020
01:24:57,940 --> 01:24:58,600
Huh?

1021
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:12,480
Sorry guys.

1022
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,140
Sorry.

1023
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,960
I completely got lost.

1024
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:23,400
Because the English version and the Japanese version are completely different.

1025
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:25,400
She just says don't think twice.

1026
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,620
Wait, how does she do that part?

1027
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:31,760
How does she do that part?

1028
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:36,660
I know the next part after is like...

1029
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:44,260
What the fuck?

1030
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:44,720
Sorry.

1031
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,280
I'm sorry.

1032
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,320
The English lyrics are just so bizarre.

1033
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,380
And also, I hate saying baby.

1034
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,660
How many times is she gonna say baby in a chorus?

1035
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:58,360
1, 2, 3, 4 times saying baby in the chorus.

1036
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,500
I don't like the English version at all.

1037
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:01,740
I only like the Japanese.

1038
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:09,490
Too many babies.

1039
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:11,310
Too many babies.

1040
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:18,710
Japanese version is so much better, but the part where she goes fast, I can't do it.

1041
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:22,490
OK, I'm gonna go to another song.

1042
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:22,950
Sorry.

1043
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:26,050
I'm annoyed.

1044
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:32,750
Sorry, I like don't think twice so much, but I'm just so annoyed right now.

1045
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:35,190
Because it's just so weird.

1046
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:38,130
It's weird.

1047
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:41,470
Back to video game song.

1048
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:46,500
Baby.

1049
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:47,360
No, you baby.

1050
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:49,140
No, you baby.

1051
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:50,660
Vtuber simp.

1052
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:51,580
Welcome to membership.

1053
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:52,300
Thank you.

1054
01:26:58,300 --> 01:26:59,740
I sing this song.

1055
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:02,880
Hold on.

1056
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:08,080
Sorry, I always have to check if these instrumentals are OK, because sometimes they're not.

1057
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,420
What the hell?

1058
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:10,160
This is Weezer.

1059
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:12,620
This is not the song that I chose.

1060
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:18,000
Why did it go to Weezer?

1061
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,320
Thank you so much for the ticket.

1062
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:29,360
Zen-chan, welcome to membership.

1063
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,400
Thank you.

1064
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:32,700
Request for Justin Bieber's Baby.

1065
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,180
Baby, but chill.

1066
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,860
Baby, baby, baby, oh...

1067
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:42,020
Baby, baby, baby, no...

1068
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:46,200
Baby, baby, baby, oh...

1069
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:50,160
You always be my baby, baby.

1070
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:55,220
It sounds like a lullaby.

1071
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:58,040
Don't speak from no doubt.

1072
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,400
I don't... I think it's... I don't know if it survives.

1073
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:10,040
Honestly, some of these are getting a little too fast for me anyway.

1074
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:11,800
For the theme.

1075
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:15,500
One last stab.

1076
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,220
You're not a nuisance.

1077
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:20,220
But I've also never played The World Ends With You, so I'm sorry.

1078
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:24,800
When you do these karaoke streams, do you sit down at a desk?

1079
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:26,060
Oh yeah, I'm sick.

1080
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:26,880
I'm sitting.

1081
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,660
Which is probably not best, but it's OK.

1082
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:34,600
I don't feel like standing.

1083
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:38,960
So, I'm just sitting.

1084
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:39,600
I'm chilling.

1085
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:49,060
If we're going to chill, surely it can't go wrong with... Stop spoiling my setlist!

1086
01:28:56,590 --> 01:28:58,030
I already had it ready.

1087
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:30,410
I stare at the stars in the sky up above And think, what am I made of?

1088
01:29:31,610 --> 01:29:35,010
Am I full of sorrow?

1089
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:39,010
Am I hurt and pained?

1090
01:29:39,770 --> 01:29:45,030
Or am I filled with love?

1091
01:29:47,130 --> 01:30:09,070
I walk by myself on the streets below And ask every child I know Do you think tomorrow will bring sun or rain?

1092
01:30:09,790 --> 01:30:14,290
Which one of these will show?

1093
01:30:16,690 --> 01:30:44,850
I can't say goodbye to yesterday, my friend I keep holding on till the end Out of the darkness, there is no other way Than the light leading to yesterday

1094
01:30:49,700 --> 01:31:20,560
It's there that I'll find inner peace, not war And dreams that I let slip away I will find the joyfulness I'm looking for Way back in yesterday

1095
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:36,260
Why can't each of us in the world ever see The best things in life are free.

1096
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:51,980
Little sounds of laughter, a warm hug, a smile, a kiss from you to me.

1097
01:32:52,980 --> 01:33:01,720
I fall to my knees, I cry and I cry.

1098
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:07,980
Love, do not pass me by.

1099
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:17,400
Happy ever after, please stay for a while.

1100
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:22,620
Make time, refuse to fly.

1101
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:32,580
I can't say goodbye to yesterday, my friend.

1102
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:39,620
Cause I know how good it has been.

1103
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:48,020
Facing forever, here I stand, come what may.

1104
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:53,720
In the old and the new, yesterday.

1105
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:07,360
It's there that I'll find inner peace, not war.

1106
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:13,940
And dreams that I let slip away.

1107
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:28,660
I will find the joyfulness I'm looking for, way back in yesterday.

1108
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:46,360
We're just gonna fade, we're just gonna fade out.

1109
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:49,960
We're just gonna, we're just gonna say goodbye to yesterday.

1110
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:53,400
We're just gonna fade out.

1111
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:55,160
Jazz solo.

1112
01:35:02,650 --> 01:35:04,600
Keep it in the background, okay.

1113
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:07,660
We'll keep it in the background.

1114
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:16,300
A very jazzy... a very jazzy... what's the word?

1115
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:19,020
Jazzy BGM.

1116
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,460
Okay, fast car.

1117
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,240
I don't think I know it.

1118
01:35:31,010 --> 01:35:32,350
Did you sing Climbing to the Moon?

1119
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:34,210
Yes, that was the first song I sang.

1120
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:37,310
That was the first song I sang.

1121
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:45,280
Dragoon, first time watcher.

1122
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:45,880
Oh my gosh.

1123
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:48,600
Hi, thank you.

1124
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,360
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1125
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:54,300
It's still going.

1126
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:56,120
There's still a whole minute left, you guys.

1127
01:35:57,160 --> 01:36:00,940
Okay, I'm gonna switch over to not game music.

1128
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:04,620
Someone requested this in the pre-chat.

1129
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:07,880
And I was gonna sing it way long ago, but I completely forgot.

1130
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:10,100
Thank you for the sub, by the way.

1131
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,100
Find on the outside.

1132
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:12,940
Oh, let me add that.

1133
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:22,520
We're jazzing, we're jamming.

1134
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:29,040
Get your whiskeys.

1135
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:32,860
Isn't that what you drink at the jazz bars?

1136
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:34,420
It's like a whiskey.

1137
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:35,600
You get them?

1138
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:39,560
Okay, I've never had a whiskey before, but I like the square...

1139
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:43,860
I like the square cups that they usually serve them in.

1140
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:47,140
So I bought one.

1141
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:53,900
I bought one of those and I drink juice in it instead.

1142
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,640
Because it's cute.

1143
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,100
It's so cute.

1144
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:07,200
Nice, that was can't say goodbye to yesterday.

1145
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:13,360
Whiskey is classy, is it?

1146
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:18,000
Can I pretend and also be classy?

1147
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:20,200
I'll put my pinky up.

1148
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:23,560
I'll put my pinky up.

1149
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:27,240
If it means having more class.

1150
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:32,840
Whiskey is dad juice, wine is mom juice.

1151
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:35,240
True, true.

1152
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:39,000
I thought dad juice was beer.

1153
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:42,820
I think beer is more dad juice and then wine is mom juice.

1154
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:45,500
Right?

1155
01:37:45,620 --> 01:37:47,020
That sounds more accurate.

1156
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:49,340
I had a tough day at work yesterday.

1157
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:50,580
Oh no, never more.

1158
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:55,320
Good luck with... I'm glad that I could help you relax.

1159
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:56,860
Good luck with the rest of your...

1160
01:37:58,540 --> 01:37:59,020
week.

1161
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:00,500
Cal falling in love.

1162
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:01,720
Oh, I can sing that one after this.

1163
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:06,140
This one was requested.

1164
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:17,720
Wait, do I also be Ryan Reynolds?

1165
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:18,660
Gosling?

1166
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:19,300
What's his name?

1167
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:20,440
Reynolds?

1168
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:21,840
No, sorry, Gosling.

1169
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:39,280
He can have his moment.

1170
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:11,400
Just one thing everybody wants.

1171
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:21,240
There in the bars and through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants.

1172
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:25,120
It's love.

1173
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:30,960
Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else.

1174
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:39,860
A rush, a glance, a touch, a dance, a look in somebody's eyes.

1175
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:45,280
To light up the skies, to open the world and send it reeling.

1176
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:50,420
A voice that says I'll be here and you'll be alright.

1177
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:59,040
I don't care if I know just where I will go.

1178
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:06,040
Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling, a rat-tat-tat on my heart.

1179
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:09,180
Think I want it to stay.

1180
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:19,100
City of stars, how you shine and just throw me.

1181
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:25,100
City of stars.

1182
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:32,220
You never shine so brightly.

1183
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:42,590
Give it up for Ryan Gosling everybody!

1184
01:40:46,850 --> 01:40:50,430
Every time I hear him go, think I want it to stay.

1185
01:40:53,770 --> 01:40:54,390
Reynolds?

1186
01:40:54,630 --> 01:40:55,710
No, it's Ryan Gosling.

1187
01:40:56,350 --> 01:40:57,870
Hold on, let me double check.

1188
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,720
Ryan Gosling, it says it right there.

1189
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,460
Think I want it to stay.

1190
01:41:10,450 --> 01:41:12,150
I sounded great in this song.

1191
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:13,170
You?

1192
01:41:14,690 --> 01:41:16,810
Wait, did you do the vocals for this?

1193
01:41:17,370 --> 01:41:20,010
I always wonder who does the vocals for these songs.

1194
01:41:21,690 --> 01:41:22,850
Like who does the...

1195
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:27,330
It's literally me.

1196
01:41:27,870 --> 01:41:29,410
Wait, now all of you are saying...

1197
01:41:29,410 --> 01:41:35,130
Can you imagine though if the actual person was like, oh yeah, that's me.

1198
01:41:35,410 --> 01:41:38,510
And here I am being like, think I want it to stay.

1199
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:45,150
Do you know Ryan Gosling is real?

1200
01:41:47,370 --> 01:41:49,490
Ryan Gosling is real name.

1201
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:57,170
It was actually Ryan Gosling confirmed.

1202
01:41:57,170 --> 01:42:03,170
If I'm actually Ryan Gosling, that guy gets...

1203
01:42:04,810 --> 01:42:06,230
Actually, maybe he doesn't.

1204
01:42:06,290 --> 01:42:07,830
I was going to say that guy gets all the ladies.

1205
01:42:08,450 --> 01:42:09,950
Wait, was he the one in the notebook?

1206
01:42:10,650 --> 01:42:13,170
And then also in the notebook, isn't the notebook a sad ending?

1207
01:42:13,550 --> 01:42:16,910
And then also he's in Blade Runner and then Blade Runner is a sad ending.

1208
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:19,170
And then also...

1209
01:42:20,770 --> 01:42:22,830
Also, La La Land is a sad ending.

1210
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:23,970
That guy gets nobody.

1211
01:42:23,970 --> 01:42:25,870
That guy gets no bitches at all.

1212
01:42:30,190 --> 01:42:31,850
He's in the notebook too.

1213
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:34,250
They made a second one?

1214
01:42:34,730 --> 01:42:35,510
Wait, what?

1215
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:36,810
No way.

1216
01:42:37,330 --> 01:42:39,170
The notebook 2.

1217
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:42,270
Ryan Reynolds.

1218
01:42:43,330 --> 01:42:45,410
They made a second one?

1219
01:42:46,970 --> 01:42:49,030
Oh my god and he was also Ken.

1220
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:51,470
That's so right and he still didn't get Barbie.

1221
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:57,010
Oh my gosh, the Ryan Reynolds curse.

1222
01:42:57,850 --> 01:42:58,990
This guy gets nobody.

1223
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:01,770
Oh wait, that's Ryan Reynolds.

1224
01:43:02,530 --> 01:43:03,670
You tricked me.

1225
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:06,690
That's not Ryan Gosling and the notebook is Ryan Reynolds.

1226
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:16,520
Wait, the notebook 1.

1227
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:18,820
Is who?

1228
01:43:22,190 --> 01:43:24,950
Wait, is there...Oh yes it is Ryan Gosling!

1229
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:37,380
Wait, is there actually a notebook 2 and Ryan Reynolds...I can't say Ryan anymore.

1230
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:41,960
Ryan Reynolds and Conan Starr in the notebook 2.

1231
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:43,260
Wait, Conan?

1232
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:43,820
Who?

1233
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:45,560
Wait,

1234
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:49,460
what?

1235
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:50,320
Is this not real?

1236
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:52,600
That's Conan O'Brien!

1237
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:54,100
What?

1238
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:56,920
Oh my god!

1239
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:57,400
Wait, no.

1240
01:44:05,380 --> 01:44:07,620
I thought they made an actual notebook 2.

1241
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,820
I never saw the notebook 1.

1242
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:11,400
So I don't know how it ends.

1243
01:44:18,810 --> 01:44:22,670
I literally just thought they called...well it says the notebook 2 and it's like called...

1244
01:44:22,670 --> 01:44:25,270
Ok, I googled the notebook 2 and it says the wedding.

1245
01:44:25,410 --> 01:44:27,470
The notebook number 2 by Nicholas Sparks.

1246
01:44:27,770 --> 01:44:29,010
Isn't that the guy that wrote the first one?

1247
01:44:30,910 --> 01:44:31,750
I thought...

1248
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:33,930
I don't recall starring in the notebook.

1249
01:44:33,930 --> 01:44:35,730
Oh, you meant O'Brien.

1250
01:44:37,850 --> 01:44:39,370
They find the notebook at the end.

1251
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:43,990
Are they...

1252
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:46,390
Are they...wait.

1253
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:50,670
So they are looking for the notebook.

1254
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:52,870
In the movie.

1255
01:44:55,830 --> 01:44:57,170
The notebook dies at the end.

1256
01:44:57,250 --> 01:44:57,510
Stop!

1257
01:44:57,770 --> 01:44:58,490
No it doesn't.

1258
01:44:58,950 --> 01:45:00,490
Unless you mean like it gets burned.

1259
01:45:01,170 --> 01:45:05,830
They are like we don't need a notebook to dictate how we love each other.

1260
01:45:06,130 --> 01:45:09,210
Instead we will write our own notebook.

1261
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:11,230
And then they write their own notebook.

1262
01:45:12,910 --> 01:45:14,170
The skit was funny.

1263
01:45:14,590 --> 01:45:15,730
The Conan O'Brien one.

1264
01:45:15,850 --> 01:45:15,930
Ok.

1265
01:45:16,850 --> 01:45:18,510
Why did they do it with Ryan Reynolds?

1266
01:45:19,290 --> 01:45:20,730
Why are they confusing me?

1267
01:45:20,770 --> 01:45:22,550
I feel like this is a targeted attack.

1268
01:45:24,430 --> 01:45:28,310
Why did they do notebook 2 with Ryan Reynolds and not with Ryan Gosling?

1269
01:45:29,810 --> 01:45:30,850
This is...

1270
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:35,510
This is a targeted attack at me.

1271
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:38,130
I don't like it.

1272
01:45:38,410 --> 01:45:39,310
She is getting paranoid.

1273
01:45:39,470 --> 01:45:40,590
I actually am.

1274
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:46,170
Because I look up the notebook 2 and I see Ryan Reynolds and I'm like oh it's Ryan.

1275
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:48,030
It's Ryan in the notebook.

1276
01:45:50,430 --> 01:45:53,190
I'm never singing La La Land ever again.

1277
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:55,030
It's messing up my brain.

1278
01:45:56,130 --> 01:45:57,910
It's messing up my brain.

1279
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:07,140
It is Ryan.

1280
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:11,120
I can't do this anymore.

1281
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:16,400
What's like...

1282
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:17,380
Oh my goodness.

1283
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:20,360
There are so many versions of this song.

1284
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:23,560
As the world caves in.

1285
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:24,280
Oh I can do that.

1286
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:35,040
Did you know that Ryan Gosling was supposed to be in Resident Evil 4?

1287
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,400
Okay, hold on.

1288
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:42,040
Let me check this version of the song.

1289
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:43,960
Maybe this one.

1290
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:50,580
I want like a... I don't think I want the Elvis Presley version.

1291
01:46:54,860 --> 01:46:55,860
Maybe this is good.

1292
01:46:59,890 --> 01:47:01,090
Yeah, I can sing this one.

1293
01:47:01,090 --> 01:47:01,390
Okay.

1294
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:07,490
Next is... Next is...

1295
01:47:07,490 --> 01:47:08,330
Oh Rise of the Moon!

1296
01:47:08,390 --> 01:47:09,050
That's a good one too.

1297
01:47:13,190 --> 01:47:15,230
What was the one that was like...

1298
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:25,160
There we go.

1299
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:25,440
Okay.

1300
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:44,180
Who's rushing?

1301
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:59,020
But I can't help falling in love with you.

1302
01:48:00,260 --> 01:48:05,300
Oh shall I stay?

1303
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:12,000
Would it be a sin?

1304
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:26,280
If I can't help falling in love with you.

1305
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:34,700
Like a river flows surely to the sea.

1306
01:48:34,700 --> 01:48:38,040
Darling so it goes.

1307
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:43,720
Some things are meant to be.

1308
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:50,460
Take my hand.

1309
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:56,700
Take my whole life too.

1310
01:48:58,340 --> 01:49:11,880
For I can't help falling in love with you.

1311
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:19,810
River flows surely to the sea.

1312
01:49:20,090 --> 01:49:22,910
Darling so it goes.

1313
01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:28,910
Some things are meant to be.

1314
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:36,170
Take my hand.

1315
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:42,290
Take my whole life too.

1316
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:56,790
For I can't help falling in love with you.

1317
01:49:57,790 --> 01:50:12,530
Oh for I, I can't help falling in love with you.

1318
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:21,290
Snake.

1319
01:50:25,110 --> 01:50:25,890
Yeah!

1320
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:29,910
I can't help falling in love with you!

1321
01:50:31,810 --> 01:50:32,710
With you.

1322
01:50:33,230 --> 01:50:34,010
With you.

1323
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:36,790
I'm gonna sing this next one.

1324
01:50:36,850 --> 01:50:38,650
Someone requested it a long time ago.

1325
01:50:39,770 --> 01:50:41,150
I forgot to sing it.

1326
01:50:43,230 --> 01:50:44,670
So I'm gonna sing it now.

1327
01:50:45,850 --> 01:50:46,790
Gonna sing it now.

1328
01:50:54,870 --> 01:50:59,010
And you don't seem to understand.

1329
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:04,010
A shame you seemed an honest man.

1330
01:51:05,710 --> 01:51:09,010
And all the fears you hold so dear.

1331
01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:14,010
Will turn to whisper in your ear.

1332
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:18,330
And you know what they say might hurt you.

1333
01:51:18,590 --> 01:51:20,290
And you know that it means so much.

1334
01:51:21,170 --> 01:51:25,010
And you don't even feel a thing.

1335
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:28,310
I am falling.

1336
01:51:29,150 --> 01:51:30,970
I am fading.

1337
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:34,670
I have lost it all.

1338
01:51:36,030 --> 01:51:41,270
And you don't seem the lying kind.

1339
01:51:41,770 --> 01:51:46,010
A shame that I can read your mind.

1340
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:49,610
And all the things that I render.

1341
01:51:52,150 --> 01:51:55,890
Candlelit smile that we both share.

1342
01:51:56,910 --> 01:51:59,490
And you know I don't mean to hurt you.

1343
01:51:59,730 --> 01:52:01,610
But you know that it means so much.

1344
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:06,110
And you don't even feel a thing.

1345
01:52:07,550 --> 01:52:09,630
I am falling.

1346
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:11,710
I am fading.

1347
01:52:12,910 --> 01:52:14,730
I am drowning.

1348
01:52:15,510 --> 01:52:16,950
Help me to breathe.

1349
01:52:17,910 --> 01:52:19,910
I am hurting.

1350
01:52:20,570 --> 01:52:23,130
I have lost it all.

1351
01:52:23,390 --> 01:52:25,190
I am losing.

1352
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:28,270
Help me to breathe.

1353
01:53:16,770 --> 01:53:18,810
Help me to breathe.

1354
01:53:19,870 --> 01:53:21,810
I am hurting.

1355
01:53:22,530 --> 01:53:24,950
I have lost it all.

1356
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:26,870
I am losing.

1357
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:31,150
Help me to breathe.

1358
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:38,930
Help me

1359
01:53:59,210 --> 01:54:00,230
to breathe.

1360
01:54:00,230 --> 01:54:03,190
I am hurting.

1361
01:54:03,590 --> 01:54:06,150
I have lost it all.

1362
01:54:06,450 --> 01:54:08,210
I am losing.

1363
01:54:09,010 --> 01:54:11,110
Help me to breathe.

1364
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:17,440
Yay.

1365
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:21,140
Gosh, it's been so long since I've watched Lain.

1366
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:26,340
I used to watch Lain back when my sister was into anime.

1367
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:29,000
I watched Lain for the first time.

1368
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:33,680
I remember one of my first tapestries I ever owned was a Lain tapestry.

1369
01:54:33,780 --> 01:54:34,820
Actually I owned two of them.

1370
01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:36,580
I had two Lain tapestries.

1371
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:42,460
Me in grade school.

1372
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:44,560
Watching Lain with my sister.

1373
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:47,360
I was 16 when Lain came out.

1374
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:48,160
It took me back.

1375
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:48,800
Oh my gosh.

1376
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:49,500
Old!

1377
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:50,280
No, I'm just kidding.

1378
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:53,820
Thank you Jason for the superchat.

1379
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:56,980
Probably the same age as... Maybe you're the same age as my sister.

1380
01:54:57,160 --> 01:54:57,580
I don't know.

1381
01:54:57,580 --> 01:54:59,100
I love you snake.

1382
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:00,240
Snake eating a rat.

1383
01:55:01,220 --> 01:55:02,260
It's true.

1384
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:03,220
That's okay.

1385
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:04,140
It's part of his charm.

1386
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:10,260
Now they have Lain NFTs.

1387
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:12,500
So sad.

1388
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:17,560
I'm like AI Lain or whatever the hell is going on.

1389
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:20,580
Gravity from Wolf's Reign.

1390
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:23,640
I know.

1391
01:55:25,740 --> 01:55:26,620
I know.

1392
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:29,600
Oh my gosh.

1393
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:30,160
Oh my gosh.

1394
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:31,180
That might take me back.

1395
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:31,540
Hold on.

1396
01:55:31,620 --> 01:55:32,440
Let me listen to it.

1397
01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:52,860
I'll learn it for next time.

1398
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:54,260
I don't remember it so much actually.

1399
01:55:54,820 --> 01:55:56,200
I think I was thinking of a different song.

1400
01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:00,160
I think I was thinking of a different song.

1401
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:03,840
Another time.

1402
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:06,160
I will do.

1403
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:07,260
I will sing.

1404
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:09,980
What was I doing?

1405
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:10,440
Oh yeah.

1406
01:56:20,570 --> 01:56:21,530
This one.

1407
01:56:22,110 --> 01:56:22,930
Is this chill?

1408
01:56:23,710 --> 01:56:25,170
Sorry, this one is kind of depressing.

1409
01:56:27,390 --> 01:56:29,810
It's chill but maybe...

1410
01:56:30,770 --> 01:56:31,370
Nausea.

1411
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:40,360
My feet are aching.

1412
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:44,580
And your back is pretty tired.

1413
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:49,040
And we've drunk a couple of bottles, babe.

1414
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:52,200
And set our grief aside.

1415
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:56,080
The papers say it's doomsday.

1416
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:59,940
The button has been pressed.

1417
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:04,460
We're gonna nuke each other up, boys.

1418
01:57:04,460 --> 01:57:08,360
Until old Satan stands impressed.

1419
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:13,160
Wait, hold on.

1420
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:13,760
Let me start over.

1421
01:57:14,020 --> 01:57:14,900
As the Wald.

1422
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:16,320
Wait, you can't hear it?

1423
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:18,640
Let me start over anyway.

1424
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:22,200
Oops.

1425
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:22,760
OK.

1426
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:23,600
Well, good thing I...

1427
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:25,280
As the Wald.

1428
01:57:25,700 --> 01:57:27,600
I missed a typo.

1429
01:57:28,180 --> 01:57:30,700
I typoed the title and it threw me off.

1430
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:32,700
As the Wald caves in.

1431
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:33,640
OK.

1432
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:35,140
Now we do for real.

1433
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:38,180
My bad.

1434
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:45,980
My feet are aching.

1435
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:48,820
And your back is pretty tired.

1436
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:53,620
And we've drunk a couple of bottles, babe.

1437
01:57:53,860 --> 01:57:57,100
And set our grief aside.

1438
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:00,700
The papers say it's doomsday.

1439
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:05,360
The button has been pressed.

1440
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:08,940
We're gonna nuke each other up, boys.

1441
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:12,700
Until old Satan stands impressed.

1442
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:16,260
And here it is.

1443
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:20,060
Our final night alive.

1444
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:26,280
As the earth burns to the ground.

1445
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:35,620
Oh boy, it's you that I lie with.

1446
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:43,760
As the atom bomb locks in.

1447
01:58:44,060 --> 01:58:51,280
Oh boy, it's you I watch TV with.

1448
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:55,760
As the Wald.

1449
01:58:56,060 --> 01:59:00,280
As the Wald caves in.

1450
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:05,500
You put your finest suit on.

1451
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:08,280
I paint my fingernails.

1452
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:13,420
Oh, we're going out in style, babe.

1453
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:16,320
And everything's on sale.

1454
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:20,260
We creep up on extinction.

1455
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:24,100
I pull your arms right in.

1456
01:59:24,940 --> 01:59:28,380
I weep and say goodnight, love.

1457
01:59:28,580 --> 01:59:31,780
While my organs pack it in.

1458
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:35,470
And here it is.

1459
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:39,600
Our final night alive.

1460
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:45,640
As the earth burns to the ground.

1461
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:54,740
Oh boy, it's you that I lie with.

1462
01:59:55,840 --> 02:00:02,640
As the atom bomb locks in.

1463
02:00:10,810 --> 02:00:15,050
As the Wald.

1464
02:00:15,270 --> 02:00:20,490
As the Wald caves in.

1465
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:25,640
Oh my god, why do I suck so much?

1466
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:29,240
Why do I suck so much?

1467
02:00:29,260 --> 02:00:30,100
I'm so sorry.

1468
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:31,860
It's so funny.

1469
02:00:41,070 --> 02:00:42,350
Wait a second.

1470
02:00:44,530 --> 02:00:44,970
Oh wait.

1471
02:00:47,090 --> 02:00:48,010
What happened?

1472
02:00:48,170 --> 02:00:49,170
I bit my tongue.

1473
02:00:54,090 --> 02:00:55,390
I bit my tongue.

1474
02:00:55,590 --> 02:00:56,270
That's what happened.

1475
02:00:58,830 --> 02:01:00,150
Did they add this officially?

1476
02:01:00,750 --> 02:01:01,670
No way.

1477
02:01:02,250 --> 02:01:02,830
Okay, hold on.

1478
02:01:05,690 --> 02:01:06,990
Oh my gosh, I think they did.

1479
02:01:21,260 --> 02:01:25,700
Day seems sometimes as if they'll never end.

1480
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:32,100
Sun digs its heels to taunt you.

1481
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:36,070
But after some of the days, one thing stays the same.

1482
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:39,300
Rise is the moon.

1483
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:47,060
Days fade into a watercolor blur.

1484
02:01:49,120 --> 02:01:53,550
Memories swim and haunt you.

1485
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:57,450
But look into the lake, shimmering like smoke.

1486
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:00,420
Rise is the moon.

1487
02:02:07,490 --> 02:02:11,410
Close your weary eyes.

1488
02:02:12,170 --> 02:02:21,270
I promise you that soon the autumn comes to darken fading summer skies.

1489
02:02:22,270 --> 02:02:27,810
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

1490
02:02:35,250 --> 02:02:39,150
Days pull you down just like a sinking ship.

1491
02:02:41,070 --> 02:02:45,650
Floating is getting harder.

1492
02:02:45,650 --> 02:02:52,070
But tread the water, child, and know that meanwhile, rise is the moon.

1493
02:02:56,820 --> 02:03:00,080
Days pull you up just like a daffodil.

1494
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:05,460
Uprooted from its garden.

1495
02:03:06,780 --> 02:03:13,280
They'll tell you what you owe, but know even so, rise is the moon.

1496
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,380
You'll

1497
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:23,650
be visited by sleep.

1498
02:03:24,190 --> 02:03:33,430
I promise you that soon the autumn comes to steal away each dream you keep.

1499
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:41,360
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

1500
02:03:51,750 --> 02:03:52,190
Yay!

1501
02:03:52,250 --> 02:03:53,530
I love the lyrics for that.

1502
02:03:53,870 --> 02:03:54,690
So good.

1503
02:03:57,150 --> 02:03:57,670
Yay!

1504
02:03:58,090 --> 02:03:59,270
Rise is the moon.

1505
02:04:00,450 --> 02:04:01,610
What kind of songs are we singing?

1506
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:02,230
We're chill.

1507
02:04:02,490 --> 02:04:03,330
We're chill tonight.

1508
02:04:03,610 --> 02:04:04,250
We're so chill.

1509
02:04:04,410 --> 02:04:04,830
We're chill!

1510
02:04:05,070 --> 02:04:05,810
Everything's chill.

1511
02:04:05,950 --> 02:04:07,170
Everything's cool and chill.

1512
02:04:08,670 --> 02:04:10,370
Yay, rise is the moon.

1513
02:04:11,690 --> 02:04:12,950
Rise is the moon.

1514
02:04:19,130 --> 02:04:20,890
You think it's somber?

1515
02:04:20,890 --> 02:04:25,890
I think it's like... I think it's like a... I think it's actually pretty uplifting.

1516
02:04:26,510 --> 02:04:28,890
I think it's like a song that's like...

1517
02:04:30,590 --> 02:04:32,510
小さな冒険者... Oh yeah, 小さな...

1518
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:39,640
It's like, you know, things might be tough, but...

1519
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:42,600
But you got this.

1520
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:47,420
Yeah, it's like that.

1521
02:04:48,620 --> 02:04:49,780
Let's see...

1522
02:04:52,640 --> 02:04:54,280
What was I going to sing next?

1523
02:04:55,220 --> 02:04:57,680
Oh, I wanted to sing this song too.

1524
02:05:06,230 --> 02:05:06,830
This one.

1525
02:05:20,260 --> 02:05:45,900
If I could begin to be half of what you think of me I could do about anything I could even learn how to love When I see the way you act Wondering when I'm coming back I could do about anything I could even learn how to love Like you

1526
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:54,020
Like you I

1527
02:06:08,350 --> 02:06:46,210
always thought I might be bad Now I'm sure that it's true Because I think you're so good And I'm nothing like you Look at you go I just adore you I wish that I knew What makes you think I'm so special If I could begin to do Something that does right by you I would do about anything I would even learn how to love

1528
02:06:51,000 --> 02:07:04,580
When I see the way you look Shaken by how long it took I could do about anything I could even learn how to love like you

1529
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:10,500
Love me like you

1530
02:07:31,210 --> 02:07:37,370
That was Love Like You, Steven Universe, which I've never watched before, but I love the music in it.

1531
02:07:40,550 --> 02:07:42,650
Yeah, Love Like You.

1532
02:07:44,370 --> 02:07:46,410
Thank you guys, thank you.

1533
02:07:47,930 --> 02:07:49,170
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1534
02:07:50,630 --> 02:07:54,250
What a very rare fish I've been grinding for during that last song.

1535
02:07:54,390 --> 02:07:56,150
Oh my gosh, congrats.

1536
02:07:56,210 --> 02:07:58,510
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1537
02:08:06,900 --> 02:08:11,400
I have a few more English songs that I want to sing.

1538
02:08:16,570 --> 02:08:17,350
I think.

1539
02:08:20,490 --> 02:08:22,810
This one, I want to sing.

1540
02:08:23,750 --> 02:08:24,790
It's one of my favorite songs ever.

1541
02:08:46,340 --> 02:09:28,310
You bet I hear the clock tick and think up in circles Confusion is nothing new Flashback, warm nights, almost left behind Suitcases, memories, time after sometimes You picture me, I'm walking too far ahead You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said Then you say,

1542
02:09:28,830 --> 02:10:00,290
go slow, I'll fall behind The second hand unwinds If you're lost, you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting Time after time If you're lost, you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall,

1543
02:10:00,370 --> 02:10:01,470
I will catch you.

1544
02:10:01,510 --> 02:10:02,710
I'll be waiting.

1545
02:10:03,590 --> 02:10:05,890
Time after time.

1546
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:28,860
My picture fades and darkness has turned to grey.

1547
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:36,260
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay.

1548
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:42,580
Secrets stolen from deep inside.

1549
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:47,220
The drum beats out of time.

1550
02:10:47,380 --> 02:10:50,980
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me.

1551
02:10:51,640 --> 02:10:53,660
Time after time.

1552
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:56,640
If you fall, I will catch you.

1553
02:10:56,700 --> 02:10:57,860
I'll be waiting.

1554
02:10:58,940 --> 02:11:01,060
Time after time.

1555
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:20,540
You said, go slow.

1556
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:27,710
I fall, the second hand unwinds.

1557
02:11:27,710 --> 02:11:31,430
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me.

1558
02:11:32,230 --> 02:11:34,190
Time after time.

1559
02:11:34,790 --> 02:11:37,090
If you fall, I will catch you.

1560
02:11:37,150 --> 02:11:38,430
I'll be waiting.

1561
02:11:39,670 --> 02:11:41,510
Time after time.

1562
02:11:42,150 --> 02:11:46,150
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me.

1563
02:11:46,950 --> 02:11:48,870
Time after time.

1564
02:11:49,490 --> 02:11:51,790
If you fall, I will catch you.

1565
02:11:51,910 --> 02:11:53,510
I will be waiting.

1566
02:11:53,510 --> 02:11:56,290
Time after time.

1567
02:13:02,140 --> 02:13:03,900
I'm already starting to get so sleepy.

1568
02:13:04,300 --> 02:13:05,540
It's only been two hours though.

1569
02:13:06,540 --> 02:13:08,860
I don't have like how many songs I want to sing today.

1570
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:11,000
I just have songs I want to sing maybe.

1571
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:14,200
I think.

1572
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:16,700
I think.

1573
02:13:17,460 --> 02:13:18,700
I'm going to try this one.

1574
02:13:21,240 --> 02:13:23,040
I don't know if I can sing it well though.

1575
02:13:26,060 --> 02:13:27,520
What's twin version?

1576
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:29,640
Oh, here, this version maybe?

1577
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:34,540
Oh wait, this is the popular version.

1578
02:13:34,640 --> 02:13:35,100
Okay, never mind.

1579
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:36,040
I'll sing this version.

1580
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:38,260
I think.

1581
02:13:53,020 --> 02:13:57,280
A hopeless romantic all my life.

1582
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:01,140
Surrounded by couples all the time.

1583
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:05,260
I guess I should take it as a sign.

1584
02:14:07,540 --> 02:14:09,500
I'm feeling lonely.

1585
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:13,740
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me.

1586
02:14:13,900 --> 02:14:16,300
Now I'm crying in my room.

1587
02:14:16,540 --> 02:14:18,720
So skeptical of love.

1588
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:22,620
But still I want it more, more, more.

1589
02:14:23,020 --> 02:14:25,620
I gave a second chance to Cupid.

1590
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:29,640
But now I'm left here feeling stupid.

1591
02:14:30,420 --> 02:14:35,960
All the way he makes me feel that love isn't real.

1592
02:14:36,620 --> 02:14:39,580
Cupid is so dumb.

1593
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:45,080
I look for his arrows every day.

1594
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:49,100
I guess he got lost or flew away.

1595
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:52,300
A waste to count the days since November.

1596
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:54,540
His loving as good as they say.

1597
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:57,480
Now I'm so lonely.

1598
02:14:57,480 --> 02:15:01,640
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me.

1599
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:04,300
Now I'm crying in my room.

1600
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:06,740
So skeptical of love.

1601
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:10,680
But still I want it more, more, more.

1602
02:15:11,040 --> 02:15:13,360
I gave a second chance to Cupid.

1603
02:15:14,940 --> 02:15:17,740
But now I'm left here feeling stupid.

1604
02:15:19,340 --> 02:15:24,020
All the way he makes me feel that love isn't real.

1605
02:15:24,020 --> 02:15:27,740
Cupid is so dumb.

1606
02:15:58,700 --> 02:16:03,540
I gave a second chance to Cupid.

1607
02:16:04,380 --> 02:16:07,680
But now I'm left here feeling stupid.

1608
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:14,240
All the way he makes me feel that love isn't real.

1609
02:16:14,620 --> 02:16:17,020
Cupid is so dumb.

1610
02:16:17,100 --> 02:16:19,400
I gave a second chance to Cupid.

1611
02:16:20,420 --> 02:16:23,660
But now I'm left here feeling stupid.

1612
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:30,060
All the way he makes me feel that love isn't real.

1613
02:16:30,060 --> 02:16:33,560
Cupid is so dumb.

1614
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:03,520
Oh my god, no way they knew.

1615
02:17:04,180 --> 02:17:05,400
That's crazy.

1616
02:17:07,140 --> 02:17:08,780
Caravan is crazy now.

1617
02:18:00,650 --> 02:18:02,050
Farewell.

1618
02:18:03,790 --> 02:18:08,470
If time comes,

1619
02:18:13,470 --> 02:18:14,910
Don't hurry.

1620
02:18:19,350 --> 02:18:25,230
I've been hurt by love since that day.

1621
02:18:25,230 --> 02:18:34,990
When I'm with you, the night continues to be the opposite of life.

1622
02:18:36,770 --> 02:18:38,810
While dancing on the popular disco,

1623
02:18:44,990 --> 02:18:48,270
I learned magic.

1624
02:18:51,230 --> 02:18:52,530
I'm sorry.

1625
02:18:57,710 --> 02:19:05,790
Don't ever fall in love with me.

1626
02:19:05,950 --> 02:19:10,290
Love is just a game.

1627
02:19:10,790 --> 02:19:14,250
That's all you need to enjoy.

1628
02:19:15,050 --> 02:19:22,710
Decorate your closed heart with a fancy dress.

1629
02:19:23,490 --> 02:19:28,170
We are always lonely friends.

1630
02:19:33,790 --> 02:19:34,570
Let's go!

1631
02:19:34,730 --> 02:19:36,310
Thanks for the ticket, Captain and Johnny!

1632
02:19:37,130 --> 02:19:38,190
Thank you for the hunk of soup!

1633
02:19:39,050 --> 02:19:39,790
Thank you!

1634
02:20:33,540 --> 02:20:33,940
We are always lonely friends.

1635
02:20:33,940 --> 02:20:33,960
Let's go!

1636
02:20:33,980 --> 02:20:34,100
Thanks for the ticket, Captain and Johnny!

1637
02:20:35,180 --> 02:20:35,620
Thank you for the hunk of soup!

1638
02:20:35,620 --> 02:20:42,880
Only halogen lights shine mysteriously.

1639
02:20:46,100 --> 02:20:51,640
Even if I whisper, I'm a cold woman like ice,

1640
02:20:58,580 --> 02:20:59,900
Don't worry.

1641
02:21:02,920 --> 02:21:05,840
I'm just playing games.

1642
02:21:05,900 --> 02:21:10,140
I know that's plastic love.

1643
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:15,080
Dance to the plastic beat.

1644
02:21:15,580 --> 02:21:19,380
Another morning comes.

1645
02:21:22,280 --> 02:21:24,540
I'm just playing games.

1646
02:21:24,740 --> 02:21:29,000
I know that's plastic love.

1647
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:33,800
Dance to the plastic beat.

1648
02:21:33,980 --> 02:21:38,100
Another morning comes.

1649
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:43,280
I'm just playing games.

1650
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:46,860
I know that's plastic love.

1651
02:21:50,420 --> 02:21:52,400
Dance to the plastic beat.

1652
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:57,480
Another morning comes.

1653
02:21:59,420 --> 02:22:01,620
I'm just playing games.

1654
02:22:02,140 --> 02:22:05,280
I know that's plastic love.

1655
02:22:12,900 --> 02:22:14,280
What a strange way to do it.

1656
02:22:14,380 --> 02:22:15,960
Usually they like fade out.

1657
02:22:18,940 --> 02:22:21,320
Thank you for the five gifts.

1658
02:22:21,460 --> 02:22:22,980
Thank you for the membership.

1659
02:22:30,120 --> 02:22:31,160
Thank you!

1660
02:22:31,720 --> 02:22:33,080
I was having a sad day.

1661
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:33,780
No!

1662
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:35,540
That's cool, why are you sad?

1663
02:22:35,960 --> 02:22:37,100
Let me kiss and make you feel better.

1664
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:39,380
My wife.

1665
02:22:44,780 --> 02:22:46,100
Thank you for the membership.

1666
02:22:46,100 --> 02:22:46,400
Thank you for the membership.

1667
02:22:47,540 --> 02:22:49,860
All these romantic songs and then Cupid and plastic love.

1668
02:22:50,380 --> 02:22:51,400
Minto, do you feel so lonely?

1669
02:22:53,180 --> 02:22:54,860
I can't help it.

1670
02:22:55,380 --> 02:22:58,200
So many songs have romance meanings, right?

1671
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:01,160
I can't help it.

1672
02:23:03,420 --> 02:23:05,680
Singing gorgeous, tall, cool, beauties.

1673
02:23:06,020 --> 02:23:08,440
Chatting, small, gremlin, probably football shaped.

1674
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:09,880
Football shaped?

1675
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:12,440
Move it, football head.

1676
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:21,320
Um...

1677
02:23:21,320 --> 02:23:23,100
I'm feeling lonely.

1678
02:23:26,660 --> 02:23:28,240
Gangnam style.

1679
02:23:28,360 --> 02:23:28,600
No!

1680
02:23:30,340 --> 02:23:36,080
What if I did a chill, beautiful version of Gangnam style?

1681
02:23:38,040 --> 02:23:42,480
Hey, sexy lady.

1682
02:23:46,580 --> 02:23:48,460
Let's see.

1683
02:23:59,570 --> 02:24:01,110
They also have this one.

1684
02:24:02,910 --> 02:24:04,310
Perfect.

1685
02:24:09,450 --> 02:24:10,670
Oh wait.

1686
02:25:09,900 --> 02:25:14,320
Stay with me.

1687
02:25:19,240 --> 02:25:23,700
Stay with me.

1688
02:25:28,660 --> 02:25:32,080
Ah Stay with me

1689
02:25:37,760 --> 02:25:40,560
口癖を言いながら 二人の時を抱いて

1690
02:25:45,980 --> 02:25:48,780
まだ忘れず 大事にしていた

1691
02:26:05,030 --> 02:26:12,730
違うものだよと 昨日言われた I feel that way too.

1692
02:26:14,550 --> 02:26:22,150
The second winter came and your heart was far away.

1693
02:26:23,350 --> 02:26:30,470
When I look back, I always felt you there.

1694
02:26:34,710 --> 02:26:36,490
Stay with me.

1695
02:26:36,490 --> 02:26:39,610
I knocked on the midnight door.

1696
02:26:41,990 --> 02:26:45,430
A hole opened in my heart.

1697
02:26:47,930 --> 02:26:52,170
That season is right in front of me.

1698
02:26:52,870 --> 02:26:54,490
Stay with me.

1699
02:26:55,430 --> 02:26:57,850
Loneliness is rolling in.

1700
02:26:59,550 --> 02:27:02,810
I'm chased by the needle of my heartbeat.

1701
02:27:05,290 --> 02:27:06,690
Stay with me.

1702
02:27:06,690 --> 02:27:07,950
I repeated the same melody.

1703
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:34,760
Stay with me.

1704
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:37,300
I knocked on the midnight door.

1705
02:27:39,460 --> 02:27:42,220
I cried out, don't go home.

1706
02:27:44,960 --> 02:27:49,980
That season is right in front of me.

1707
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:52,220
Stay with me.

1708
02:27:53,060 --> 02:27:59,300
While saying the words, I embraced our time.

1709
02:28:03,460 --> 02:28:05,420
I didn't forget it yet.

1710
02:28:05,900 --> 02:28:07,020
I kept it warm.

1711
02:28:08,080 --> 02:28:10,380
Stay with me.

1712
02:28:10,380 --> 02:28:12,760
I knocked on the midnight door.

1713
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:17,820
I cried out, don't go home.

1714
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:25,400
That season is right in front of me.

1715
02:28:26,060 --> 02:28:28,220
Stay with me.

1716
02:28:28,600 --> 02:28:34,600
While saying the words, I embraced our time.

1717
02:28:38,140 --> 02:28:41,380
I didn't forget it yet.

1718
02:28:41,500 --> 02:28:42,700
I kept it warm.

1719
02:28:43,780 --> 02:28:45,480
Stay with me.

1720
02:28:46,420 --> 02:28:48,220
I knocked on the midnight door.

1721
02:28:50,420 --> 02:28:52,460
I cried out, don't go home.

1722
02:28:56,280 --> 02:29:00,800
That season is right in front of me.

1723
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:05,940
Stay with me.

1724
02:29:14,550 --> 02:29:16,350
I didn't forget it yet.

1725
02:29:17,190 --> 02:29:17,990
I kept it warm.

1726
02:29:22,680 --> 02:29:24,620
Yay, the midnight door.

1727
02:29:26,380 --> 02:29:26,900
Nice.

1728
02:29:28,300 --> 02:29:30,560
Guys, I'm starting to feel...

1729
02:29:30,560 --> 02:29:32,520
I don't know, a little light-headed.

1730
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:35,760
So I might just do the songs that I have left that I wrote down.

1731
02:29:37,320 --> 02:29:38,840
Maybe because I need to eat dinner.

1732
02:29:41,620 --> 02:29:47,760
Let's see, I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

1733
02:29:48,540 --> 02:29:50,040
Maybe 9 songs left.

1734
02:29:51,240 --> 02:29:52,880
That's enough, I think.

1735
02:29:54,100 --> 02:29:55,080
That's enough, maybe.

1736
02:29:56,880 --> 02:29:58,620
Have I done any Adventure Time songs?

1737
02:29:59,220 --> 02:30:01,180
I could bust out my...

1738
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:03,120
Oh, I would have to plug it in.

1739
02:30:04,420 --> 02:30:06,180
I could bust out my Omnicord.

1740
02:30:13,080 --> 02:30:14,880
Yeah, I have an Omnicord.

1741
02:30:15,480 --> 02:30:17,160
For those who don't know, it's what...

1742
02:30:18,200 --> 02:30:22,200
Some of the songs in Adventure Time.

1743
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:23,800
Wait, where is it?

1744
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:27,220
Is it in the closet?

1745
02:30:27,440 --> 02:30:27,740
Hold on.

1746
02:30:28,660 --> 02:30:29,460
Let me find it.

1747
02:30:31,500 --> 02:30:33,280
And then I would have to...

1748
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:36,520
I would have to get the chords up for it.

1749
02:30:38,860 --> 02:30:40,080
One second, one second.

1750
02:30:40,260 --> 02:30:40,900
Let me put some music.

1751
02:31:41,980 --> 02:31:44,640
I have it, but I don't know where the chord is.

1752
02:31:44,720 --> 02:31:46,420
I didn't pack the chord in the case.

1753
02:31:47,340 --> 02:31:48,840
I might have to do it another day.

1754
02:31:49,440 --> 02:31:52,200
Because I might have to go searching through a bunch of chords.

1755
02:31:53,100 --> 02:31:53,540
No!

1756
02:31:58,650 --> 02:32:00,070
David, thank you for the Aqua Super!

1757
02:32:01,270 --> 02:32:04,490
We might have a Christmas present for you tonight.

1758
02:32:06,130 --> 02:32:07,310
What does that mean?

1759
02:32:08,090 --> 02:32:08,790
What does that mean?

1760
02:32:10,590 --> 02:32:12,470
I want to do...

1761
02:32:13,230 --> 02:32:14,770
Hold on, it might be in this box.

1762
02:32:14,870 --> 02:32:15,530
Hold on, let me check.

1763
02:32:15,710 --> 02:32:16,570
Sorry, sorry.

1764
02:32:16,690 --> 02:32:17,030
Hold on.

1765
02:34:03,010 --> 02:34:04,050
I found it.

1766
02:34:04,650 --> 02:34:05,550
I found it.

1767
02:34:05,550 --> 02:34:08,230
Hold on, I have to position it.

1768
02:34:08,410 --> 02:34:12,670
I have to put it on my legs and then...

1769
02:34:12,670 --> 02:34:17,730
I have to put my legs up and then I move my mic down.

1770
02:34:18,090 --> 02:34:19,590
Probably, let me turn off my noise gate.

1771
02:34:20,870 --> 02:34:23,950
Let me turn off my noise gate for this.

1772
02:34:24,910 --> 02:34:25,910
And then turn it.

1773
02:34:31,030 --> 02:34:31,330
Wait.

1774
02:34:38,460 --> 02:34:39,360
The sound is on.

1775
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:41,560
What is it doing?

1776
02:34:41,560 --> 02:34:41,980
Is

1777
02:34:48,530 --> 02:34:51,190
it because of my headphones?

1778
02:34:54,670 --> 02:34:56,590
Where is the chords though?

1779
02:34:56,710 --> 02:34:58,410
Hold on.

1780
02:34:58,610 --> 02:34:59,710
Gosh, I don't remember.

1781
02:34:59,810 --> 02:35:01,590
It's been a minute since I've done this.

1782
02:35:07,020 --> 02:35:08,060
No chord.

1783
02:35:09,980 --> 02:35:10,780
There we go.

1784
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:16,060
Can you hear it?

1785
02:35:19,990 --> 02:35:22,670
The speaker is like...

1786
02:35:24,750 --> 02:35:25,350
Where?

1787
02:35:25,830 --> 02:35:26,190
Here?

1788
02:35:30,330 --> 02:35:30,850
It's low.

1789
02:35:45,100 --> 02:35:46,240
Can you hear me?

1790
02:35:50,490 --> 02:35:52,970
Could you plug it in from the headphones output?

1791
02:35:54,950 --> 02:35:59,970
No, I don't have the right type of...

1792
02:35:59,970 --> 02:36:03,330
I don't have the right type of thing.

1793
02:36:03,330 --> 02:36:06,070
But they're remaking the Ami chord.

1794
02:36:06,270 --> 02:36:07,570
I don't know if they've already done it or not.

1795
02:36:09,730 --> 02:36:11,770
I don't know if they've already made the new one.

1796
02:36:12,030 --> 02:36:12,810
If it's out yet.

1797
02:36:13,210 --> 02:36:16,130
I want to get it once it is and then I can do it digitally, you know.

1798
02:36:19,710 --> 02:36:20,070
Okay.

1799
02:36:21,430 --> 02:36:22,710
Okay, I turned it down for a second.

1800
02:36:22,850 --> 02:36:23,950
Give me one second.

1801
02:36:32,700 --> 02:36:33,420
Maybe here.

1802
02:36:33,420 --> 02:36:33,480
Maybe here.

1803
02:36:41,900 --> 02:36:43,260
Wait.

1804
02:36:49,370 --> 02:36:50,770
That's Am, right?

1805
02:37:28,090 --> 02:37:29,390
Feels high.

1806
02:37:29,930 --> 02:37:30,570
Maybe not.

1807
02:37:34,270 --> 02:37:35,090
Wait.

1808
02:37:36,010 --> 02:37:38,070
It might sound weird with the echo.

1809
02:37:38,550 --> 02:37:39,510
Actually, I'll turn it off.

1810
02:37:51,870 --> 02:37:53,350
It sounds off, right?

1811
02:37:55,950 --> 02:37:56,830
No, no.

1812
02:37:56,970 --> 02:37:57,670
No rock.

1813
02:37:57,990 --> 02:37:58,450
No rock.

1814
02:37:58,890 --> 02:37:59,370
No rock.

1815
02:37:59,790 --> 02:38:00,330
No rock.

1816
02:38:15,620 --> 02:38:16,260
Parsley.

1817
02:38:16,620 --> 02:38:17,180
Wait.

1818
02:38:17,620 --> 02:38:18,260
Parsley.

1819
02:38:33,680 --> 02:38:34,460
Me too.

1820
02:38:36,680 --> 02:38:38,960
I better keep me alive.

1821
02:38:39,340 --> 02:38:40,700
It's making me crazy.

1822
02:38:41,500 --> 02:38:43,740
And I need to save you.

1823
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:45,840
Who's going to save me?

1824
02:38:46,400 --> 02:38:50,900
Please forgive me for whatever I do.

1825
02:38:51,720 --> 02:38:54,240
When I don't remember you.

1826
02:38:58,680 --> 02:39:02,360
How do I turn off the beat?

1827
02:39:02,720 --> 02:39:04,320
I can make it even faster.

1828
02:39:10,820 --> 02:39:11,180
Marceline!

1829
02:39:12,600 --> 02:39:12,960
Marceline!

1830
02:39:14,180 --> 02:39:14,540
Marceline!

1831
02:39:28,810 --> 02:39:29,750
This is not chill mint dough.

1832
02:39:29,810 --> 02:39:30,070
You're right.

1833
02:39:30,150 --> 02:39:30,310
Sorry.

1834
02:39:30,490 --> 02:39:30,770
My bad.

1835
02:39:31,010 --> 02:39:31,230
Sorry.

1836
02:39:31,330 --> 02:39:31,570
You're right.

1837
02:39:33,050 --> 02:39:33,590
You're right.

1838
02:39:33,770 --> 02:39:33,890
You're right.

1839
02:39:34,070 --> 02:39:34,210
You're right.

1840
02:39:34,350 --> 02:39:34,530
You're right.

1841
02:39:35,330 --> 02:39:35,830
You're right.

1842
02:39:35,990 --> 02:39:36,210
You're right.

1843
02:39:36,330 --> 02:39:36,610
You're right.

1844
02:39:37,030 --> 02:39:37,330
You're right.

1845
02:39:38,870 --> 02:39:39,470
Shut up.

1846
02:39:39,670 --> 02:39:40,090
Shut up.

1847
02:39:44,860 --> 02:39:45,220
No!

1848
02:39:48,570 --> 02:39:49,130
There we go.

1849
02:39:50,590 --> 02:39:51,190
There we go.

1850
02:39:51,270 --> 02:39:51,390
Okay.

1851
02:39:51,450 --> 02:39:52,030
We're better now.

1852
02:39:52,130 --> 02:39:52,510
We're better.

1853
02:39:53,970 --> 02:39:54,590
We're better.

1854
02:39:54,730 --> 02:39:54,890
Okay.

1855
02:39:57,890 --> 02:39:58,270
Okay.

1856
02:39:58,470 --> 02:39:58,670
Okay.

1857
02:40:28,710 --> 02:40:29,650
How does the beginning go?

1858
02:40:34,910 --> 02:40:36,410
Isn't there like a part at the very beginning?

1859
02:40:46,070 --> 02:40:47,410
I can't remember the other chord.

1860
02:40:48,790 --> 02:40:48,930
No.

1861
02:40:48,990 --> 02:40:49,850
I'm going to find a different place.

1862
02:40:54,660 --> 02:40:55,220
Maybe here.

1863
02:41:02,080 --> 02:41:02,400
Wait.

1864
02:41:02,460 --> 02:41:02,780
Is it here?

1865
02:41:22,400 --> 02:41:22,720
No.

1866
02:41:22,760 --> 02:41:23,080
Don't play.

1867
02:41:23,420 --> 02:41:23,660
No.

1868
02:41:23,680 --> 02:41:23,980
Don't play.

1869
02:41:24,200 --> 02:41:24,660
Don't play.

1870
02:41:28,240 --> 02:41:30,600
Am I weird for liking that Mint said to shut up?

1871
02:41:34,620 --> 02:41:35,320
Uh-oh.

1872
02:41:35,660 --> 02:41:36,180
Uh-oh.

1873
02:41:36,780 --> 02:41:37,260
Freak!

1874
02:41:37,460 --> 02:41:37,740
Uh-oh.

1875
02:41:37,840 --> 02:41:38,260
Freak!

1876
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:39,480
Freak!

1877
02:41:41,680 --> 02:41:42,160
Freak!

1878
02:41:42,180 --> 02:41:42,700
Oh, no!

1879
02:41:46,820 --> 02:41:50,620
I wish this one had the heckin' lyrics.

1880
02:41:51,220 --> 02:41:51,940
Sorry, guys.

1881
02:41:52,040 --> 02:41:54,600
I'm just trying to find a decent place.

1882
02:41:56,220 --> 02:41:57,120
Oh, here we go.

1883
02:42:01,300 --> 02:42:06,620
Marceline, is it just you and me in the wreckage of the world?

1884
02:42:07,540 --> 02:42:11,740
That must be so confusing for a little girl.

1885
02:42:12,900 --> 02:42:17,960
And I know you're going to need me here with you.

1886
02:42:18,660 --> 02:42:24,080
But I'm losing myself and I'm afraid you're going to lose me, too.

1887
02:42:26,140 --> 02:42:31,460
This magic keeps me alive, but it's making me crazy.

1888
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:36,560
And I need to save you, but who's going to save me?

1889
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:46,520
Please forgive me for whatever I do when I don't remember you.

1890
02:42:48,500 --> 02:42:55,220
Marceline, I can feel myself slipping away.

1891
02:42:55,920 --> 02:43:00,340
I can't remember what it made me say.

1892
02:43:01,780 --> 02:43:06,280
But I remember that I saw you frown.

1893
02:43:07,320 --> 02:43:11,860
I swear it wasn't me, it was the crown.

1894
02:43:13,360 --> 02:43:19,100
This magic keeps me alive, but it's making me crazy.

1895
02:43:19,560 --> 02:43:24,580
And I need to save you, but who's going to save me?

1896
02:43:25,040 --> 02:43:32,920
Please forgive me for whatever I do when I don't remember you.

1897
02:43:36,120 --> 02:43:45,520
Please forgive me for whatever I do when I don't remember you.

1898
02:44:05,490 --> 02:44:07,230
Yay, that's my Omnicord.

1899
02:44:08,490 --> 02:44:09,830
That's my Omnicord.

1900
02:44:09,970 --> 02:44:11,330
Okay, now I have to fix my mic.

1901
02:44:12,410 --> 02:44:12,670
Okay.

1902
02:44:13,330 --> 02:44:15,990
Oh, sorry, that was Remember You from Adventure Time.

1903
02:44:22,030 --> 02:44:23,070
Omnicord version.

1904
02:44:24,550 --> 02:44:25,630
Thanks, Omnicord.

1905
02:44:27,590 --> 02:44:29,430
I wonder what else I can play on this.

1906
02:44:29,910 --> 02:44:31,150
Anything I want, probably.

1907
02:44:32,730 --> 02:44:34,250
Anything I want, probably.

1908
02:44:34,430 --> 02:44:35,490
Okay, back at the noise gate.

1909
02:44:37,530 --> 02:44:39,250
Remember Me from Encanto.

1910
02:44:39,510 --> 02:44:42,190
I wonder, Remember Me...

1911
02:44:43,770 --> 02:44:44,290
Chords.

1912
02:44:45,750 --> 02:44:47,170
Let's see, actually, oh no.

1913
02:44:50,030 --> 02:44:52,730
Oh wait, these have chords that I don't know.

1914
02:44:53,150 --> 02:44:54,910
Wait, F major 7.

1915
02:44:57,110 --> 02:44:59,270
I have F7.

1916
02:45:02,780 --> 02:45:08,320
Remember me, though I have to say goodbye.

1917
02:45:08,960 --> 02:45:10,420
Remember me.

1918
02:45:12,480 --> 02:45:15,600
What is... Oh, is that B flat?

1919
02:45:18,440 --> 02:45:19,840
Oh, here, here.

1920
02:45:34,400 --> 02:45:35,800
That doesn't sound right.

1921
02:45:38,520 --> 02:45:39,680
That doesn't sound right either.

1922
02:45:46,220 --> 02:45:49,820
A secret song to you.

1923
02:45:50,220 --> 02:45:51,780
I don't remember this part.

1924
02:45:53,700 --> 02:45:54,920
Remember Me.

1925
02:45:54,980 --> 02:45:56,300
We started so strong.

1926
02:45:59,140 --> 02:46:04,420
Remember Me is not from Encanto, it's from Coco.

1927
02:46:10,640 --> 02:46:11,960
It's a faster song?

1928
02:46:12,220 --> 02:46:13,700
No, not the lullaby version.

1929
02:46:14,700 --> 02:46:20,360
Remember me, though I have to travel far.

1930
02:46:20,720 --> 02:46:27,800
Remember me, each time you hear a sad guitar.

1931
02:46:29,420 --> 02:46:38,440
Know that I'm with you, the only way that I can be.

1932
02:46:41,160 --> 02:46:44,840
Until you're in my arms again.

1933
02:46:45,620 --> 02:46:46,960
Okay, I can do the second part.

1934
02:46:47,080 --> 02:46:48,440
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1935
02:46:49,400 --> 02:46:50,160
Noise gate off.

1936
02:46:50,300 --> 02:46:50,840
Alright, hold on.

1937
02:46:51,260 --> 02:46:52,040
Down, down, down.

1938
02:47:06,380 --> 02:47:11,860
Remember me, though I have to travel far.

1939
02:47:12,360 --> 02:47:18,240
Remember me, each time you hear a sad guitar.

1940
02:47:19,220 --> 02:47:25,640
Know that I'm with you, the only way that I can be.

1941
02:47:26,600 --> 02:47:31,940
Until you're in my arms again.

1942
02:47:42,400 --> 02:47:43,320
Remember...

1943
02:47:43,320 --> 02:47:43,940
Yay!

1944
02:47:44,580 --> 02:47:46,100
Oh my gosh, I love my Omnicorn.

1945
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,400
I'll put you here.

1946
02:47:54,920 --> 02:47:55,980
I'll put you there.

1947
02:47:56,700 --> 02:47:57,400
Take a sippy.

1948
02:47:58,800 --> 02:48:00,320
Oh, I forgot to turn the noise gate off.

1949
02:48:00,360 --> 02:48:00,880
Sorry, my bad.

1950
02:48:03,940 --> 02:48:05,600
Hopefully, you could hear it fine.

1951
02:48:07,540 --> 02:48:08,540
Hopefully, you could hear it fine.

1952
02:48:08,860 --> 02:48:10,520
Alright, shall we continue?

1953
02:48:12,220 --> 02:48:13,240
Jimbo does it again.

1954
02:48:13,600 --> 02:48:14,180
With what?

1955
02:48:14,540 --> 02:48:15,360
What did I do?

1956
02:48:15,580 --> 02:48:16,300
What did I do?

1957
02:48:16,300 --> 02:48:16,340
What did I do?

1958
02:48:27,980 --> 02:48:30,740
Let's see if there's a karaoke version of this song.

1959
02:48:37,390 --> 02:48:39,050
There's a piano version of this song.

1960
02:48:40,410 --> 02:48:41,330
Maybe that'll work.

1961
02:48:41,450 --> 02:48:42,250
Thanks for the gifted!

1962
02:48:46,010 --> 02:48:47,650
Thanks for the ten!

1963
02:48:49,550 --> 02:48:50,930
The ten gifted, thank you!

1964
02:48:52,690 --> 02:48:54,070
Let's see if this sounds any good.

1965
02:48:56,430 --> 02:49:01,190
Nah, I'm just gonna do the instrumental and hope that I don't die.

1966
02:49:01,290 --> 02:49:03,390
This is a mini karaoke, it should be okay.

1967
02:49:06,610 --> 02:49:11,050
Hopefully, my channel's not like, you will suffer.

1968
02:49:11,930 --> 02:49:12,430
Hold on.

1969
02:49:14,030 --> 02:49:15,210
Okay, I should be fine.

1970
02:49:36,920 --> 02:50:47,180
Koronde surimuita toko Chi ga nijinde shimiru keredo Ecchara sa sugu naoru kara Ashita miwakasa uta dekiru Misaki kara fune wo daseba Kaze wo uke ho ga fukuramu Boku wa ima tsuchi wo hanare Nanatsu no umi wo matarikakeru Inami kara kaze ga fuite Kyuu ni ame furi hajimeta Gyoru wa sugu tonari ni iru Zenata kumo no torikomanakucha

1971
02:50:56,740 --> 02:50:57,280
Yay!

1972
02:50:57,740 --> 02:50:59,000
Chii -Sanai Boukensha!

1973
02:51:00,300 --> 02:51:01,860
It was just the TV size version.

1974
02:51:01,940 --> 02:51:03,080
I actually don't know the full version.

1975
02:51:03,760 --> 02:51:04,520
So that should be okay.

1976
02:51:04,880 --> 02:51:05,660
Just that version.

1977
02:51:06,080 --> 02:51:06,360
Hopefully.

1978
02:51:06,860 --> 02:51:07,560
Hopefully it's fine.

1979
02:51:08,060 --> 02:51:08,820
Don't get mad at me.

1980
02:51:10,360 --> 02:51:12,160
It's just a small version.

1981
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:18,960
Live for karaoke streams.

1982
02:51:19,020 --> 02:51:19,660
Thank you!

1983
02:51:29,190 --> 02:51:32,630
This one is a summer song, but it's okay.

1984
02:51:33,010 --> 02:51:34,550
I think.

1985
02:51:34,730 --> 02:51:36,330
It's okay to sing some summer songs.

1986
02:51:54,760 --> 02:51:55,820
It's not even winter.

1987
02:51:56,040 --> 02:51:56,380
It's fall.

1988
02:52:15,020 --> 02:52:22,360
知りながら それでも そばにいたいと 願ったの

1989
02:52:28,950 --> 02:52:37,370
夏の匂い 雨の中で ぼたぼた落ちる 金魚花火

1990
02:52:41,390 --> 02:52:58,390
光で目が眩んで I'm going to change the background for this song, sorry, for jumpscare... jumpscare!

1991
02:53:53,600 --> 02:53:54,160
I'm

1992
02:53:58,890 --> 02:54:00,370
taking no more requests after this.

1993
02:54:32,970 --> 02:54:36,830
I'm going to change the background for this song, sorry, for jumpscare...

1994
02:54:36,830 --> 02:54:36,830
jumpscare!

1995
02:55:01,470 --> 02:55:05,110
I'm taking no more requests after this.

1996
02:55:05,130 --> 02:55:05,330
I'm taking no more requests after this.

1997
02:55:05,330 --> 02:55:12,770
I'm taking no more

1998
02:56:03,960 --> 02:56:12,780
requests after

1999
02:56:28,260 --> 02:56:33,060
this.

2000
02:56:33,060 --> 02:56:41,980
I'm taking no more requests after this.

2001
02:56:58,020 --> 02:57:11,960
I'm taking no more requests after this.

2002
02:57:11,960 --> 02:57:41,940
I'm taking no more requests after this.

2003
02:58:13,820 --> 02:58:26,000
I'm taking no more requests after this.

2004
02:58:26,020 --> 02:58:26,140
I'm taking no more requests after this.

2005
02:58:28,040 --> 02:58:36,240
I'm taking no more requests after this.

2006
02:58:38,300 --> 02:58:56,120
I'm taking no more requests after this.

2007
02:58:56,120 --> 02:59:03,040
I'm taking no more requests after this.

2008
02:59:03,040 --> 02:59:09,080
I'm taking no more requests after this.

2009
02:59:09,960 --> 02:59:14,740
I'm taking no more requests after this.

2010
02:59:19,300 --> 02:59:23,300
I'm taking no more requests

2011
02:59:36,570 --> 02:59:46,270
after this.

2012
03:00:13,430 --> 03:00:16,250
I'm taking no more requests after this.

2013
03:00:18,550 --> 03:00:25,530
I'm taking no more requests after this.

2014
03:00:25,530 --> 03:00:32,990
I'm taking no more requests after this.

2015
03:00:32,990 --> 03:00:33,110
I'm taking no more requests after this.

2016
03:00:34,010 --> 03:00:39,790
I'm taking no more requests after this.

2017
03:01:08,840 --> 03:01:11,580
For those who are just like, you gotta play Rakuza!

2018
03:01:11,860 --> 03:01:13,440
Of course I will, eventually.

2019
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:17,720
It's on my list of things to play, to stream.

2020
03:01:17,720 --> 03:01:26,500
Yay, that was bakamitai, bakamitai, bakamitai, bakamitai...

2021
03:01:26,500 --> 03:01:27,760
Oh no,

2022
03:01:30,940 --> 03:01:31,340
not this.

2023
03:01:35,320 --> 03:01:37,320
Lack of better name, thanks for the 10 gifted!

2024
03:01:37,920 --> 03:01:39,880
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2025
03:01:40,960 --> 03:01:47,500
Let me see if this sounds any good, and maybe I can sing this one since someone requested it earlier, but it's not a chill song!

2026
03:01:47,600 --> 03:01:49,660
Why do you have to pick not chill songs, man?

2027
03:01:51,680 --> 03:01:52,860
Bakamitai got me into vtubers?

2028
03:01:54,560 --> 03:01:55,400
The lore.

2029
03:01:55,840 --> 03:01:57,100
The Sam Barney lore.

2030
03:01:58,920 --> 03:01:59,760
Youtube, are you okay?

2031
03:02:00,220 --> 03:02:00,760
Oh, here we go.

2032
03:02:04,780 --> 03:02:06,240
Okay, I can sing this one, I think.

2033
03:02:08,660 --> 03:02:09,620
Let me get the lyrics.

2034
03:02:13,120 --> 03:02:14,960
I did some way less chill songs, okay?

2035
03:02:15,100 --> 03:02:18,820
Hey, hey, hey, they're all pretty chill.

2036
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:21,820
They're all chill.

2037
03:02:22,920 --> 03:02:23,580
Kind of chill.

2038
03:02:24,300 --> 03:02:25,160
They're all pretty chill.

2039
03:02:30,590 --> 03:02:33,990
This is the least to chill that anyone requested.

2040
03:02:35,570 --> 03:02:36,330
You have to admit.

2041
03:02:44,320 --> 03:03:04,240
Fushigi da ne ima no kimochi Sora kara fute kita mitai Tokubetsu no kisetsu no iro ga Tokimeki wo miseru yo

2042
03:03:07,320 --> 03:03:26,720
Hajimete deatta toki kara Ryokan ni sawagu kokoro no melody Tomerarenai tomaranai Naze todokete setsunasa ni wa

2043
03:03:30,080 --> 03:03:52,860
名前をつけようか Snow Halation 想いが重なるまで 待てずに 悔しいけど 過ぎた純情 微熱の中 ためらってもダメだね 飛び込む勇気に賛成

2044
03:05:06,720 --> 03:05:16,070
I want to hug you.

2045
03:05:24,770 --> 03:05:26,970
I'm sorry,

2046
03:05:35,230 --> 03:05:37,190
I'm not taking any more requests.

2047
03:05:44,110 --> 03:05:45,430
Flintstones.

2048
03:05:57,350 --> 03:05:59,690
So no halation.

2049
03:06:13,740 --> 03:06:14,700
How's this go?

2050
03:06:37,380 --> 03:06:39,380
Flintstones, meet the Flintstones.

2051
03:06:39,600 --> 03:06:41,460
They're the modern Stone Age family.

2052
03:06:42,400 --> 03:06:46,760
From the town of Bedrock, they're a page right out of history.

2053
03:06:47,800 --> 03:06:52,880
Let's ride with the family down the street, through the courtesy of friends to feed.

2054
03:06:52,880 --> 03:06:57,280
When you're with the Flintstones, have a yabba-dabba-doo time.

2055
03:06:57,460 --> 03:06:58,580
A dabba-doo time.

2056
03:06:58,940 --> 03:07:01,240
Do yabba-dabba-doo.

2057
03:07:01,500 --> 03:07:03,820
Do yabba-dabba-dabba-doo.

2058
03:07:04,180 --> 03:07:07,000
Yabba-dabba-dabba-dabba-doo.

2059
03:07:08,160 --> 03:07:10,440
We'll have a great old time.

2060
03:07:11,340 --> 03:07:11,980
Yabba-dabba-doo time.

2061
03:07:46,680 --> 03:07:48,360
Yabba-dabba-doo transition.

2062
03:07:49,580 --> 03:07:52,320
This was Annie Men's Piano Sheets.

2063
03:07:52,400 --> 03:07:57,300
Thank you very much for allowing me to use your thing without me asking, but thank you for letting me use it.

2064
03:07:57,800 --> 03:08:00,300
Yay, Alexander, thank you for the pink.

2065
03:08:00,720 --> 03:08:01,560
Thank you.

2066
03:08:03,740 --> 03:08:06,920
And, oh gosh, wait, I saw it earlier.

2067
03:08:08,440 --> 03:08:10,220
Yay, thank you so much for the hakusupa.

2068
03:08:11,100 --> 03:08:12,860
Nikomaki was my original phantom.

2069
03:08:15,140 --> 03:08:16,140
Goodness gracious.

2070
03:08:16,280 --> 03:08:17,940
Pallory, thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

2071
03:08:19,320 --> 03:08:20,960
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

2072
03:08:21,640 --> 03:08:23,540
Do yabba-dabba-doo.

2073
03:08:24,200 --> 03:08:25,980
Do yabba-dabba-dabba-doo.

2074
03:08:26,600 --> 03:08:29,120
Yabba-dabba-dabba-dabba-doo.

2075
03:08:29,640 --> 03:08:32,000
We'll have a get up time.

2076
03:08:32,320 --> 03:08:33,800
Thanks, Minto, of course.

2077
03:08:36,420 --> 03:08:37,760
Yabba-dabba-doo.

2078
03:08:42,280 --> 03:08:45,600
OK, a little bit of tonal whiplash, maybe.

2079
03:08:46,900 --> 03:08:47,460
Actually, no.

2080
03:08:48,260 --> 03:08:50,420
A lot of people were asking for this earlier, too.

2081
03:08:55,980 --> 03:08:58,420
Hold on, let me see if there's...

2082
03:09:08,660 --> 03:09:10,740
Oh my god, this is so weird.

2083
03:09:11,200 --> 03:09:14,560
I looked up Tabi no Tochu and there's a karaoke version, but...

2084
03:09:14,560 --> 03:09:23,560
If you look it up in Japanese, like Tabi no Tochu Karaoke, there's a video that is a karaoke version, but instead of Holo, it's Ina.

2085
03:09:25,220 --> 03:09:25,780
What?

2086
03:09:27,180 --> 03:09:30,040
It's like Ina cosplaying Holo.

2087
03:09:31,020 --> 03:09:31,500
What?

2088
03:09:34,320 --> 03:09:35,660
This is so bizarre.

2089
03:09:35,880 --> 03:09:39,660
Wait, I want to see if the lyrics, the comments are just like...

2090
03:09:39,660 --> 03:09:41,040
Why is Ina the one...

2091
03:09:41,040 --> 03:09:45,040
Wait, this mix isn't from Ina's cover, but I like her MV.

2092
03:09:45,920 --> 03:09:49,200
Oh, so they know it's not Holo.

2093
03:09:51,920 --> 03:09:52,760
Wait a second.

2094
03:09:53,960 --> 03:09:56,920
Oh, they just used her music video.

2095
03:09:57,240 --> 03:09:58,060
That's so funny.

2096
03:09:58,900 --> 03:10:01,360
Oh wait, I can sing it and watch Ina at the same time?

2097
03:10:01,440 --> 03:10:02,540
Oh my gosh, what a treat.

2098
03:10:04,560 --> 03:10:06,060
Alright, Tabi no Tochu.

2099
03:10:13,760 --> 03:10:14,340
There we go.

2100
03:10:20,300 --> 03:10:22,320
That was literally me when I saw it.

2101
03:10:27,220 --> 03:10:28,660
Sing time.

2102
03:11:34,520 --> 03:11:37,320
Sing along.

2103
03:11:59,220 --> 03:12:02,020
Sing along.

2104
03:12:40,790 --> 03:13:11,430
I know loneliness In your eyes I'll blink and reflect that color I'll fly high into the sky And become a crescent moon Ah, the crimson star is surely a tear drop.

2105
03:13:15,790 --> 03:13:22,730
The eastern country's harbor is the western sea.

2106
03:13:24,630 --> 03:13:31,370
In the dark forest, the southern town is the golden tower.

2107
03:13:32,370 --> 03:13:42,110
On the northern hill, the same moon was swaying.

2108
03:13:48,660 --> 03:14:00,280
If I could hold your hand, where would we go?

2109
03:14:00,280 --> 03:14:04,560
Please, just you and me.

2110
03:14:05,780 --> 03:14:08,940
We can go anywhere.

2111
03:14:13,040 --> 03:14:18,920
Let's go and embrace the rustling scent of a world we haven't seen yet.

2112
03:14:41,680 --> 03:14:51,840
La la la...

2113
03:14:51,840 --> 03:14:54,460
La la la...

2114
03:15:47,500 --> 03:15:51,280
I think this one works.

2115
03:15:56,300 --> 03:15:58,240
Posted by GothicKittyXXX.

2116
03:15:59,220 --> 03:16:00,580
I love that.

2117
03:16:03,420 --> 03:16:05,140
Dango, dango,

Oh, sorry.

Zashiau dango.

2122
03:16:32,610 --> 03:16:33,730
Hold on, hold on.

2123
03:16:33,810 --> 03:16:34,330
I gotta restart.

2124
03:16:35,350 --> 03:16:39,030
The lyrics are too slow in the video.

2125
03:16:42,980 --> 03:16:44,260
They're too slow in the video.

2126
03:16:44,460 --> 03:16:45,020
Okay, here we go.

2127
03:16:45,180 --> 03:16:45,620
One more time.

2128
03:16:47,560 --> 03:16:49,000
One more time, one more time.

2129
03:17:19,180 --> 03:17:21,840

Ureshii koto ka rashii koto mo.

2152
03:20:09,340 --> 03:20:13,120
Zenbu marumete.

2153
03:21:00,000 --> 03:21:02,520
Dango dango

2154
03:21:06,770 --> 03:21:07,970
daikazoku.

2155
03:21:31,280 --> 03:21:31,760
Yay!

2156
03:21:32,720 --> 03:21:33,660
Dango daikazoku!

2157
03:21:36,300 --> 03:21:37,260
Thank you!

2158
03:21:37,960 --> 03:21:40,240
I don't know if you saw me say thank you.

2159
03:21:40,600 --> 03:21:42,300
I was like thank you!

2160
03:21:43,380 --> 03:21:44,320
Thank you!

2161
03:21:44,860 --> 03:21:45,900
Hold on, my YouTube froze.

2162
03:21:48,280 --> 03:21:50,260
Another sad song time, guys.

2163
03:21:52,940 --> 03:21:56,580
That was one of the first few anime I've ever watched that made me cry my eyes out.

2164
03:21:58,780 --> 03:22:03,540
I know I love Clannad.

2165
03:22:05,120 --> 03:22:08,730
I think I like After Story more than regular Clannad, but...

2166
03:22:10,180 --> 03:22:11,580
I love both.

2167
03:22:14,800 --> 03:22:19,080
It is one of those anime that just makes you feel like...

2168
03:22:19,080 --> 03:22:25,800
It is one of those anime that's like, oh my gosh, watching this feels actually life changing.

2169
03:22:26,580 --> 03:22:27,200
You know?

2170
03:22:28,260 --> 03:22:31,140
For me, afterlife changing, but you know, same thing.

2171
03:22:35,530 --> 03:22:36,210
Hold on.

2172
03:22:39,170 --> 03:22:40,490
I'm getting my chat back.

2173
03:22:41,570 --> 03:22:43,170
After Story is better, but you can't watch it.

2174
03:22:43,230 --> 03:22:46,690
Yeah, yeah, you can't watch it until you watch the first Clannad, it's true.

2175
03:22:49,670 --> 03:22:53,730
Viewers are discussing their emotional reactions to the anime Clannad and it's spin-off After Story.

2176
03:22:53,730 --> 03:22:56,030
Wow, the chat summary is right.

2177
03:22:56,190 --> 03:22:56,850
That's crazy.

2178
03:22:58,490 --> 03:22:59,530
Gonna watch it now, thanks.

2179
03:22:59,630 --> 03:23:00,690
Oh my gosh, you should.

2180
03:23:00,990 --> 03:23:04,110
Oh my god, it is one of those anime that just...

2181
03:23:04,110 --> 03:23:06,470
Actually leaves like a mark on you.

2182
03:23:07,350 --> 03:23:09,190
A place further than the universe is another...

2183
03:23:09,730 --> 03:23:12,530
I love that anime so much.

2184
03:23:12,590 --> 03:23:13,790
Oh, Pillar, welcome to membership.

2185
03:23:14,010 --> 03:23:14,810
Thank you.

2186
03:23:16,110 --> 03:23:18,090
Thank you so much.

2187
03:23:20,570 --> 03:23:22,290
Maybe I can add that.

2188
03:23:22,910 --> 03:23:25,290
It's not really a slow, it's not really a chill song though.

2189
03:23:29,360 --> 03:23:31,560
Anyway, let me do this next one.

2190
03:23:37,040 --> 03:23:37,820
This one.

2191
03:23:59,540 --> 03:24:17,480
Okay with Just me Just me Just me Just me And I'll be fine I

2192
03:24:22,600 --> 03:24:45,420
like to eat in school by myself Anyway So I'll just stay right here, right here, right here, right here.

2193
03:24:45,760 --> 03:24:51,900
And I'll be fine on the outside.

2194
03:24:53,800 --> 03:24:59,700
So I just sit in my room, after hours with the moon.

2195
03:25:01,380 --> 03:25:05,760
And think of who knows my name.

2196
03:25:06,300 --> 03:25:09,120
Would you cry if I died?

2197
03:25:09,260 --> 03:25:13,920
Would you remember my face?

2198
03:25:30,030 --> 03:25:43,670
So I left home, I packed up and I moved far west one day.

2199
03:25:44,150 --> 03:25:46,350
And I laughed,

2200
03:25:54,900 --> 03:25:57,720
I sound fine.

2201
03:26:22,630 --> 03:26:26,510
Sometimes I feel lost, sometimes I'm confused.

2202
03:26:26,510 --> 03:26:34,630
Sometimes I find that I am not alright.

2203
03:26:35,710 --> 03:26:43,050
And I cry, and I cry, and I cry.

2204
03:27:13,160 --> 03:27:18,640
So I just sit in my room, after hours with the moon.

2205
03:27:18,640 --> 03:27:24,660
And think of who knows my name.

2206
03:27:25,140 --> 03:27:28,060
Would you cry if I died?

2207
03:27:28,180 --> 03:27:34,000
Would you remember my face?

2208
03:27:47,230 --> 03:27:50,510
Yay, that one was requested for everybody who's just like...

2209
03:27:50,510 --> 03:27:52,390
Oh my gosh, you said chill, not sad.

2210
03:27:52,950 --> 03:27:54,250
That was one that was requested.

2211
03:27:55,550 --> 03:27:57,250
That one was requested.

2212
03:27:57,790 --> 03:27:58,050
Okay.

2213
03:27:58,590 --> 03:27:58,930
Okay.

2214
03:28:00,970 --> 03:28:01,970
I didn't pick it.

2215
03:28:03,210 --> 03:28:04,890
I mean I did, but it was requested.

2216
03:28:05,610 --> 03:28:05,910
Okay.

2217
03:28:10,230 --> 03:28:11,270
Let's see...

2218
03:28:13,290 --> 03:28:16,910
I said I would do a revenge of that one song I did at the beginning.

2219
03:28:19,310 --> 03:28:20,690
I'm actually crying.

2220
03:28:20,830 --> 03:28:22,350
No, don't cry.

2221
03:28:23,290 --> 03:28:25,010
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

2222
03:28:26,950 --> 03:28:29,410
How could I ever forget my beloved Minky's face?

2223
03:28:29,990 --> 03:28:30,370
Minky!

2224
03:28:32,810 --> 03:28:33,330
Minky!

2225
03:28:34,030 --> 03:28:35,710
I have just a few more songs.

2226
03:28:35,970 --> 03:28:37,110
Maybe two more songs.

2227
03:28:40,850 --> 03:28:43,150
I can't tell if I want to sing this one or not.

2228
03:28:45,210 --> 03:28:46,770
I can't tell if I want to sing this one or not.

2229
03:28:46,870 --> 03:28:47,910
Let me see if they have it here.

2230
03:28:52,100 --> 03:28:56,060
I will do my will even though it's not a very chill song, you know.

2231
03:29:01,010 --> 03:29:03,290
Oh no, wait, I had another song I wanted to do.

2232
03:29:05,090 --> 03:29:06,090
There's too many songs.

2233
03:29:07,430 --> 03:29:09,050
There's too many songs I want to sing.

2234
03:29:09,910 --> 03:29:11,670
It's already been three and a half hours.

2235
03:29:17,510 --> 03:29:18,770
Nah, I'll save it for next time.

2236
03:29:19,910 --> 03:29:21,010
I'll save it for next time.

2237
03:29:21,350 --> 03:29:22,210
What about this one though?

2238
03:29:22,210 --> 03:29:22,970
Hold on, let me hear it.

2239
03:29:26,250 --> 03:29:27,970
You can't listen, I listen.

2240
03:29:28,570 --> 03:29:29,890
Do I remember how this one goes?

2241
03:29:33,090 --> 03:29:34,150
Can you sing the Minky song?

2242
03:29:34,650 --> 03:29:35,010
Minky!

2243
03:29:35,290 --> 03:29:35,650
Minky!

2244
03:29:36,010 --> 03:29:36,370
Minky!

2245
03:29:39,170 --> 03:29:40,650
Thank goodness you couldn't hear it.

2246
03:29:40,670 --> 03:29:41,910
It was so loud in my ears.

2247
03:29:46,160 --> 03:29:47,680
This one is so depressing.

2248
03:29:47,880 --> 03:29:49,020
Okay, I'm gonna save it for later.

2249
03:29:50,660 --> 03:29:52,060
This one is so sad.

2250
03:29:52,120 --> 03:29:54,520
I can't do like five sad songs in a row.

2251
03:29:54,720 --> 03:29:55,500
It's too much.

2252
03:29:56,480 --> 03:29:56,960
Minky!

2253
03:29:57,220 --> 03:29:57,540
Minky!

2254
03:29:57,800 --> 03:29:58,280
Minky!

2255
03:30:07,390 --> 03:30:08,570
Yes, you can.

2256
03:30:13,700 --> 03:30:16,600
I already did one like this earlier though.

2257
03:30:16,600 --> 03:30:18,220
She hates us?

2258
03:30:19,900 --> 03:30:21,460
You can, it's your stream.

2259
03:30:22,300 --> 03:30:23,140
I'll try it.

2260
03:30:23,300 --> 03:30:24,360
I've never sung this one before.

2261
03:30:27,380 --> 03:30:30,600
Okay, now before you get excited about the title...

2262
03:30:32,540 --> 03:30:34,280
Before you're like, yo, wait a second.

2263
03:30:34,720 --> 03:30:35,540
Wait a second, Mito!

2264
03:30:36,060 --> 03:30:37,460
This is too sad!

2265
03:30:41,340 --> 03:30:42,320
It's fine.

2266
03:30:42,780 --> 03:30:43,480
It's fine.

2267
03:30:50,470 --> 03:30:54,750
Why does the sun go on shining?

2268
03:30:57,110 --> 03:31:01,570
Why does the sea rush to shore?

2269
03:31:03,710 --> 03:31:09,890
Don't they know it's the end of the world?

2270
03:31:10,090 --> 03:31:21,190
Cause you don't love me anymore Why do the birds go on singing?

2271
03:31:23,730 --> 03:31:28,210
Why do the stars glow above?

2272
03:31:30,350 --> 03:31:36,030
Don't they know it's the end of the world?

2273
03:31:36,710 --> 03:31:47,990
It ended when I lost your love I wake up, I wonder...

2274
03:31:47,990 --> 03:31:48,870
Sorry, the voice...

2275
03:31:48,870 --> 03:31:55,490
Why everything's the same as it was?

2276
03:31:56,470 --> 03:31:58,370
I can't understand.

2277
03:31:59,210 --> 03:32:01,010
No, I can't.

2278
03:32:01,050 --> 03:32:02,650
I don't actually remember this part.

2279
03:32:02,750 --> 03:32:03,070
Oh gosh.

2280
03:32:03,730 --> 03:32:13,610
Life goes on the way it does Why does my heart go on beating?

2281
03:32:14,930 --> 03:32:21,250
Except I'm dead and it doesn't Why do these eyes of mine cry?

2282
03:32:22,970 --> 03:32:28,790
Don't they know it's the end of the world?

2283
03:32:29,410 --> 03:32:40,110
It ended when you said goodbye Why does my heart go on beating?

2284
03:32:42,510 --> 03:32:47,230
Why do these eyes of mine cry?

2285
03:32:49,270 --> 03:32:55,010
Don't they know she started stream late?

2286
03:32:55,610 --> 03:33:00,990
It ended when you said goodbye

2287
03:33:09,470 --> 03:33:11,310
Sorry, I had to...

2288
03:33:11,910 --> 03:33:16,710
I started listening to the lyrics and it felt really relatable to you guys, I felt.

2289
03:33:19,030 --> 03:33:21,810
It just sort of felt relatable to you all, I think.

2290
03:33:22,270 --> 03:33:24,090
In a way, I was like...

2291
03:33:24,090 --> 03:33:26,330
They're always crying, those guys.

2292
03:33:27,890 --> 03:33:28,930
So dramatic.

2293
03:33:29,810 --> 03:33:33,010
Why do the birds go on singing?

2294
03:33:34,610 --> 03:33:38,950
Why do these eyes of mine cry?

2295
03:33:39,570 --> 03:33:44,570
Don't you know she hasn't started stream?

2296
03:33:45,490 --> 03:33:53,090
It ended where it started Wait, it was supposed to start five minutes ago

2297
03:33:59,270 --> 03:34:00,590
Wait, why?

2298
03:34:00,590 --> 03:34:00,970
Why?

2299
03:34:04,570 --> 03:34:07,470
Okay, I'll do My Will Last, it's a little bit more of a hype song.

2300
03:34:13,750 --> 03:34:14,630
This song...

2301
03:34:14,630 --> 03:34:17,290
Wait, this is... Oh, there's two different versions.

2302
03:34:18,110 --> 03:34:18,710
Let's do this one.

2303
03:34:40,700 --> 03:34:55,400
Feeling kind of sick tonight All I've had is coffee and leftover pie It's no wonder why...

2304
03:34:55,400 --> 03:34:56,300
Oh, shit!

2305
03:34:56,480 --> 03:34:56,740
Ow!

2306
03:34:57,200 --> 03:34:59,060
One more time.

2307
03:34:59,240 --> 03:35:00,640
Sorry, I keep forgetting that part.

2308
03:35:14,980 --> 03:35:31,940
Feeling kind of sick tonight All I've had is coffee and leftover pie It's no wonder

2309
03:35:40,840 --> 03:36:02,940
Still you take up all my mind I don't even think that you care like I do I should stop, heaven knows I've tried I

2310
03:36:08,820 --> 03:36:16,220
will stop falling in love with you

2311
03:36:19,360 --> 03:36:55,580
Someday, someone will like me like I like you Until then, I'll drink my coffee, eat my pie And pretend that we are more than friends Then of course, I'll let you break my heart again This makes me want pumpkin pie, right?

2312
03:36:57,600 --> 03:37:17,260
I'm just trying to understand What I am to you More than songs we've exchanged Midnight calls, sunset view

2313
03:37:23,040 --> 03:37:43,860
Promise I don't mean to cry But I get overwhelmed and confused If you only knew what I felt like

2314
03:37:47,060 --> 03:37:57,480
One day, I will stop falling in love with you

2315
03:38:01,620 --> 03:38:06,280
Someday, someone will like me

2316
03:38:13,020 --> 03:38:21,660
Until then, I'll drink my coffee, eat my pie Pretend that we are more than

2317
03:38:25,140 --> 03:38:32,920
Then of course, I'll let you break my heart again

2318
03:38:41,430 --> 03:39:13,870
Someday, one day, I will stop falling in love with you Until I do, I'll be thinking of you Let you break my heart again

2319
03:39:25,390 --> 03:39:34,610
Yay Okay, I'll get better at that song, I promise I'll get better at that song.

2320
03:39:34,690 --> 03:39:36,070
One last song, everybody

2321
03:39:42,060 --> 03:39:46,400
