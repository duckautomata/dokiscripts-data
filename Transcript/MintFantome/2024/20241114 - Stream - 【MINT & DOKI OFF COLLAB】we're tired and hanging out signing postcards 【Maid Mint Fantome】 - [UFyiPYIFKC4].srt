1
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,190
Hey!

2
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,730
Well I just realized I have to be BGM.

3
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,970
Wait, during the starting?

4
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,330
What?

5
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,430
Oh no, no, now!

6
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:43,930
Now, okay!

7
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,530
I was gonna be like, were you just listening to nothing?

8
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,750
Like, I was like...

9
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,970
I was listening.

10
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:49,890
Sure, you were.

11
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,830
In my brain!

12
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,950
You know what she was saying?

13
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,870
She was like, what if I just don't turn it off to start?

14
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,910
Like, what if I just never swap off to starting screen.

15
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,390
I was like, wow.

16
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,750
Yeah, you do that.

17
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,010
I was gonna leave you in limbo forever.

18
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,690
Yeah, she hates us.

19
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:06,830
Yeah.

20
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,670
We're really tired, by the way.

21
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,670
Yeah, hi guys, we're so sleepy.

22
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,730
We're very tired.

23
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,270
We're signing the postcards and we're...

24
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,870
We're doing postcards again, guys.

25
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,070
We're never gonna stop.

26
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,010
This is...

27
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,250
Our original plan was to play on the Switch.

28
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,690
I know, I brought my Switch.

29
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,150
She brought her Switch and everything.

30
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,810
I was like, let's play Mario Party.

31
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,370
Yeah.

32
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,910
And we have 200 postcards to sign.

33
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,970
That's rookie numbers for me.

34
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,730
My signature, because of this pen, is getting bigger and bigger.

35
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,070
So sorry, guys, I have a thick pen.

36
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,570
Sorry, guys, there's like some tech...

37
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,490
Not even technical, some physical difficulties with some of the postcards.

38
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,950
We're doing our best.

39
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,230
And if you're like, why are you signing postcards?

40
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,590
It's for the concert.

41
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,410
It's for Phantom Thief.

42
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,210
Phantom Thief.

43
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,850
We were debating whether or not to tell you guys this, but we were like, you know what, it's sort of obvious.

44
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,550
Like, why we're sort of together other than dance practices.

45
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,570
Wait, what was I gonna say?

46
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,750
That we saw it.

47
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,190
No, I know.

48
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:23,850
No, hold on.

49
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,350
Never mind.

50
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,630
Oh, I was gonna ask the audio.

51
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,150
Oh, okay.

52
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,190
Can we ask the audio, right?

53
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:31,950
Yeah.

54
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,330
People are saying marriage because we...

55
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:35,590
What?

56
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,890
Because you were like, there's another reason we're together.

57
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:41,930
Oh!

58
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,410
I'm so confused.

59
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,770
Doki is quiet.

60
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,030
I can make us louder.

61
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,810
Because I'm far away from the mic.

62
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,210
Okay, I made us louder.

63
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,370
Oh my god, hold on.

64
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,610
But if we laugh, it's gonna be crazy.

65
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,130
If I laugh, it'll be like so...

66
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:57,330
That's not fair.

67
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,250
You get the light.

68
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

69
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,570
There you go.

70
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,270
Can we push this up a little bit more?

71
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,410
Push it?

72
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,910
Bring it to us?

73
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

74
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,930
I feel like I'm a fucking rat right now.

75
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,090
Is that better?

76
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,210
The mic is right in between us.

77
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,770
Doki is just looking down.

78
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,210
I'm fucking signing!

79
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,370
I know, I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

80
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,750
I'm just saying you're looking down.

81
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,590
I'm looking at chat so I can make sure things are good.

82
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,550
You said that negatively.

83
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,730
How was I supposed to take...

84
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,790
Okay, I refuse to sign this.

85
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,030
I'm quickly going on a strike.

86
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,710
Okay, you wanna finish your sentence from earlier?

87
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,530
Alright, so...

88
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,890
The reason why we're here is that we were testing out our 3D!

89
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:56,090
We were testing out our 3D stuff to make sure everything will be okay for next month.

90
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,890
Yeah, oh my god.

91
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,610
We were also doing our dance practices there as well.

92
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,650
It was so...

93
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,430
It was...

94
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,330
We were...

95
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,970
We were not okay.

96
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,410
Guys, we look so cute though.

97
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:14,910
I know.

98
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,030
Yeah, we looked really cute guys.

99
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,210
I'm so excited to actually have 3D finally.

100
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:23,690
Yeah.

101
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,330
Oh my god.

102
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,570
I did Soldier Boy.

103
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:40,210
Yeah, it's the first thing we did when we got there.

104
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,490
Stop, you're shaking the table!

105
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,490
Sorry, when we tried out our 3D.

106
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,610
It was good.

107
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,330
It was fun.

108
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,010
It was fun.

109
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,310
We just been hanging out.

110
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,650
We got back from dinner.

111
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,590
You guys...

112
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,430
Here's another thing that we did.

113
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,430
Mint did Ganon style.

114
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:03,930
No,

115
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,130
I did not!

116
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,530
I'm no style.

117
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,850
Mint did Ganon style.

118
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,490
Yes, I saw it.

119
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,650
I did Sexy Lady.

120
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,910
Yeah, so we've been dancing.

121
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:20,890
I'm sore.

122
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,270
I'm like...

123
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:22,270
Me too.

124
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,350
I think... I don't like the pillows.

125
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,970
They're making my neck hurt.

126
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,550
The pillows?

127
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,410
Yeah.

128
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,130
I sleep with like a specific pillow.

129
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,870
Oh, these pillows.

130
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:32,530
Yeah, no.

131
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,330
Okay, also guys, by the way...

132
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,690
The showers here fucking sucks.

133
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,070
We discovered something while we were here.

134
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,210
Because we were like...

135
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,130
You just took a shower.

136
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,010
And you were like...

137
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,950
I think the showers are backwards.

138
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,250
Okay, so like...

139
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,910
Mint was like texting us in the group chat.

140
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,530
Being like, there's something wrong with this.

141
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,270
No, that was actually real though.

142
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,250
It was hot.

143
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,270
And then it got cold.

144
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,570
And I had to take a cold shower.

145
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,750
And it was the worst thing ever.

146
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,210
Okay, but then like...

147
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,750
I was wondering.

148
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,950
I was like, wait, you're right.

149
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,730
How come the showers aren't as hot?

150
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,450
I have it all the way up.

151
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,230
I was really confused.

152
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,450
I was like, wait, you're right.

153
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,250
This is weird.

154
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,410
So then I realized...

155
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,950
If you put it all the way down...

156
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,790
Near the off switch...

157
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,530
It actually gets hotter.

158
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,950
But the thing labels was like...

159
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,370
The further up, it's hotter.

160
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,730
But it's not.

161
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,750
I was like, I need to test it on your bathroom.

162
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,890
I went to her bathroom to test it out.

163
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,190
She's like, no, that's not true.

164
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,530
That can't be true.

165
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,770
I just always put it in the middle.

166
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,150
Who puts it in the middle?

167
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,930
I don't want it scalding my skin.

168
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,690
It's not even scalding.

169
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,930
Yeah, the label's misleading.

170
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,070
Any normal person would put the hot at the top.

171
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,350
I don't understand.

172
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,550
It was at the top.

173
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,690
The label said it was at the top.

174
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,410
Mine was warm when I took a shower this morning.

175
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,430
But you put it in the middle.

176
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,250
Yeah, that's the thing.

177
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,470
The middle was where it was hot.

178
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,570
But it was not super hot.

179
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,130
I was confused because I would put it at the top.

180
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,570
I'm a normal person.

181
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:16,490
Okay.

182
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,330
I'm a ghost.

183
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:20,970
I'm not a person.

184
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,950
My ectoplasm is literally going to melt.

185
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,030
What do you want from me?

186
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,490
I would be jelly.

187
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,910
I wouldn't even be able to dance.

188
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,630
I thought people liked slime girls.

189
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,030
People are like, don't be normal.

190
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,830
Yeah, but men is not a definition of normal.

191
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,630
You guys know that.

192
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,550
Okay, whatever.

193
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,830
You think that's an insult to me?

194
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,370
No, I know it's not.

195
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,030
I wear my freak with pride.

196
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,690
Freaks, rise up!

197
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:59,450
She was talking to the technicians at the studio and they were talking about like What?

198
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:08,790
They were talking about being weebs and stuff and she was with her people and I was full on disassociated.

199
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,050
I think you fell asleep.

200
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,050
No, I was just looking at my phone.

201
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,690
They were talking about their times.

202
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,130
We were like idols and stuff.

203
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,710
Yeah, idols and Japan and everything.

204
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,070
And I was just like on my phone Freaks, fall!

205
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,290
There they go.

206
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,930
We're not sure how long today's stream will be.

207
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:35,450
Yeah.

208
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,550
Because we're so tired.

209
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:41,470
Practice fucked us up.

210
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:50,230
But Dancing in the suits is so different than dancing without it.

211
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:56,150
So we kept bumping into each other.

212
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:07,630
We have several duets together and there were times when we would accidentally bump into each other during the thing.

213
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,510
Because we weren't used to dancing next to each other.

214
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,470
We would practice without the other person there.

215
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,390
Yeah, exactly.

216
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:22,750
So when you meet up and practice and also in the suits we were so uncoordinated.

217
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,610
But we got better.

218
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,790
We figured it out.

219
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,410
We're confident for the concert.

220
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,170
We're so confident next month.

221
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,930
We have a whole month.

222
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,730
What if we forget it?

223
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,230
A whole month without the other person.

224
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,510
Alright, time to bump into each other live!

225
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:45,630
So if we bump into each other next month then like...

226
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,410
Don't perceive.

227
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,850
Don't even look at us.

228
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,570
Don't come to the concert.

229
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,930
No, no, no.

230
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,830
We need to sell the concert tickets.

231
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,370
Live bumpies.

232
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,950
Close your eyes.

233
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,250
Just if you see anything.

234
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:05,890
Close your eyes.

235
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,850
Yeah, if you see anything, you...

236
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,030
Can you imagine if we're dancing and suddenly...

237
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,010
Close your eyes!

238
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,190
No, we mess up and we just see the entire audience just shut their eyes.

239
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,330
That would be so silly.

240
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,570
Don't acknowledge our mistakes.

241
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:29,010
Also, the reason why we said the postcards might have some physical difficulties is because we were given different sizes Sharpies.

242
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,630
My Sharpie is really watery.

243
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,990
Because we were finally given more than one Sharpie.

244
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,810
And then mine is thinner than hers.

245
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,410
Hers is like extra thick.

246
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,730
Yeah, mine's thick.

247
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:46,550
If you guys are wondering Wow, Doki, why is yours so thin?

248
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,550
Please don't judge.

249
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,070
No, I think yours looks good.

250
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,650
Don't judge it.

251
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,330
Yeah, but some people like it thick.

252
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,710
The way you looked at me.

253
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:03,970
Yeah.

254
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,490
The way you just kind of were like

255
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,150
Talking about Sharpies, right?

256
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,050
Yeah.

257
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,190
Why did you say it like that?

258
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,370
The way you had to call me out this morning.

259
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,930
I didn't even call you out!

260
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,590
Actually, yeah, it was someone else that did.

261
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:31,530
No, okay, so like, you know, like the one of the technicians was like Wow, wow, man.

262
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,170
I can't believe you replied to that.

263
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,050
And then I took a, and then like they showed their phone.

264
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,990
But I was just looking at the mode.

265
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,750
And then I like looked at it for one second and knew exactly what they meant.

266
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,310
And then I was like, and I looked at her and was like, yeah, well, I did you.

267
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,710
And then she was like, it was just a butt, right?

268
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,890
And I was like, no, it's a fucking...

269
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,530
And then I looked at it for one second and processed it.

270
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,510
And I was like, no, it isn't.

271
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,470
I'm tired.

272
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,250
And then she was like, it was the morning!

273
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,910
Yeah, that's so tired.

274
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,490
And then she was like, no!

275
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,970
You know, I'm so sorry everybody.

276
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,650
They're not sorry.

277
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,490
And you know it.

278
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,790
They're like, hehehe.

279
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,190
We got her.

280
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,710
We got her.

281
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,010
Guys...

282
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:37,790
You're lucky I'm here you guys you're so lucky because I I swear I swear I swear, I was just like I've been replaced.

283
00:14:37,950 --> 00:15:03,910
I'm never coming back Oh thank god Shut up Shut up Also like before we started streaming She made a Metal Gear reference to me and I don't even remember what she said to me I said I'm gonna put you here with the With the glasses because you're Kazuhira Doki And I didn't acknowledge her.

284
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,990
I didn't even say anything.

285
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,810
I was like, why can't you be a Metal Gear fan?

286
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,910
Like why can't you just be in a Metal Gear?

287
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,550
Why can't you just be in a Metal Gear?

288
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:27,550
Yeah, and then I was just like not everybody's perfect Only perfect beings like Metal Gear And then I put like, amendment though Wait, if I didn't like Metal Gear I would be perfect?

289
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,630
Is that what you're implying?

290
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,010
No, I'm implying that That I'm perfect?

291
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:41,770
No, I'm implying that like A perfect person wouldn't judge other people for their lack of references This feels really rich

292
00:15:45,210 --> 00:16:10,130
Um, okay I don't know I'm saying you should... Shut up You should have less prejudice against It wasn't prejudice, it's me just wishing that I had someone else Oh my gosh, Metal Gear Solid 2 is out for 23 years today Yippee!

293
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:20,570
I think about Metal Gear Solid 2 probably like 10 times a day Daily, everybody You know, I'm just saying When was the 10 times?

294
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:40,730
Today I literally had my snake out And I was like, do it for him That's one Every time I look at him, that's him That's one And then I thought about it when I was thinking about She had her what out?

295
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:56,570
Oh my god, you guys are so awful It was a snake It's my snake figure, you guys It's not even Solid Snake No, that is not Solid Snake That's another time There's more than one snake?

What makes him naked?

299
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,770
It's his name in the mission Yeah, but why is he called Naked Snake?

300
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,750
Why is his codename naked?

301
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:51,490

00:45:55,170 --> 00:46:00,590
It's a serious thing to stop what you're doing in a stream to sing happy birthday.

471
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:05,430
It's very rare to have both of us to sing for you at the same time.

472
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,930
It is a rare opportunity.

473
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:08,970
It's a rare opportunity.

474
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:11,110
You're like, wow, I can't believe it's also my birthday today.

475
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:14,070
Oh yeah, I was born just now.

476
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:15,770
Thank you, Yippie.

477
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,210
Thanks for all the gifted memberships and superchats.

478
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:23,110
Thank you.

479
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:24,170
Thanks, guys.

480
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:25,870
Thank you, guys.

481
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:26,870
I'm working for free.

482
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:27,650
What?

483
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:29,430
Yeah?

484
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,950
You have to stream Rust.

485
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:34,630
Today?

486
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:36,150
Are you going to?

487
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:36,970
I should.

488
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:39,230
That's why this one will be not so long.

489
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:41,710
Yeah, I should stream Rust.

490
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:45,390
I don't even know if my laptop can handle it.

491
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:45,990
We'll find out.

492
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,730
What I can do is...

493
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:49,710
Well, actually, I just have this pile.

494
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:51,770
I can...

495
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:55,450
After this, I can continue signing and then I'll just give it to you.

496
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:56,330
No, I can keep going.

497
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,150
I'll just stream Rust at a later time.

498
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:00,030
Okay, you guys are never getting that gun.

499
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:02,530
No, they are.

500
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:05,390
It's like a duo gun with Saekunos.

501
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:07,250
They can just have Saekunos stream it.

502
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:07,990
Okay.

503
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:11,630
Obviously, they want to get it from my stream.

504
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:12,630
Guys, plan B...

505
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,170
They want it from your stream.

506
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:14,510
I know.

507
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:15,130
That's what I'm saying.

508
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:19,670
Plan B is Saekunos stream.

509
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:23,030
First, we're not at plan B yet.

510
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:27,570
We don't need to do plan B yet because there might be a hope for us to get it today.

511
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:28,730
When does it end?

512
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,010
I think it ends on the 17th.

513
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:32,250
So, there's plenty of time.

514
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:32,710
There's time.

515
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:33,090
Okay.

516
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:36,170
I don't know what's going on with my tribe now.

517
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:45,010
Apparently, I got a message from the leader and they were like, oh yeah, we had a concert yesterday.

518
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:46,250
A concert?

519
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:47,230
Yeah, in Rust.

520
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:48,830
They can do that?

521
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:49,810
Yeah, I was like, what?

522
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:50,430
A concert?

523
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:55,090
And obviously, I missed out on the concert because of my own concert.

524
00:47:55,410 --> 00:48:00,130
And then two days later, he was like, we're parachuting today to the kingdoms.

525
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,950
Oh my god.

526
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:05,590
We're parachuting down to the kingdoms today.

527
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,530
And then I didn't reply.

528
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:10,070
What kind of game is Rust?

529
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,070
I don't know.

530
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,110
I don't even know.

531
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:15,370
There's like a lot.

532
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:17,390
You cannot build a nightclub in Rust.

533
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:19,390
Is it like GTA?

534
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:21,050
You can.

535
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:23,030
There's roleplayers there.

536
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:23,870
And there's like a cult.

537
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,150
There's like several cults.

538
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,910
Yeah, there's like a blood god cult.

539
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:30,750
And then there's like some musician in the cult.

540
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:32,170
And he does like...

541
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:32,650
Oh my god.

542
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:33,610
Wait, I'll show you a video.

543
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,330
Wait, we have to sing another happy birthday.

544
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:36,110
This is for Jonathan.

545
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:36,670
Okay, wait.

546
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:39,730
Is it really your birthday or because you pretend it's your birthday because I said that?

547
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,450
Today, three months ago, is my birthday.

548
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:45,270
Come on.

549
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:45,930
I told you.

550
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:46,930
At least they're honest.

551
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:47,710
Yeah.

552
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:50,130
That's why I was like, are you sure?

553
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,650
Are you absolutely sure?

554
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:53,730
I'll show you a clip.

555
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:54,630
Okay.

556
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:56,390
It was pretty cool.

557
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:58,530
Like, he literally comes up with these songs live.

558
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:03,550
Happy birthday to you.

559
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,010
Let's just do a happy birthday for everybody.

560
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:06,550
Okay, this is for everybody.

561
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,010
It's all your birthdays now.

562
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:13,230
Happy birthday to you.

563
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:18,490
Happy birthday to you.

564
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:24,530
Happy birthday dear Metal Gear Solid 2.

565
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:25,770
Everyone.

566
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:32,090
Happy birthday to you.

567
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:39,230
All right, you guys are going to listen to this too because I'm just going to play it on my phone.

568
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:39,670
Okay.

569
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:40,850
This is like...

570
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:41,390
It might not be loud enough.

571
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:42,830
The noise gate might grab it.

572
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:43,510
Okay, wait.

573
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:44,890
How's the internet, though?

574
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,690
I'm trying to...

575
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:51,210
Thanks for clipping my stuff, guys, so I can just pull it up on...

576
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:51,610
Oh, my God.

577
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,350
Which apple juice is mine?

578
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:54,370
I didn't drink any.

579
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:57,230
I didn't either, but one's from last night.

580
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,290
I don't know.

581
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,530
I don't know either.

582
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:03,110
I think...

583
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:05,070
Do you remember drinking a lot of apple juice?

584
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:05,350
No.

585
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:07,170
Me neither, though.

586
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:10,130
Oh, I see you.

587
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:11,630
What is this?

588
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:13,510
Oh, this is...

589
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,290
Okay, so he makes up these songs.

590
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:22,430
So he basically live sings all of this.

591
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:23,210
Oh, okay.

592
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:38,810
What is going on?

593
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:40,530
He's dropping the beat for us.

594
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,590
Okay.

595
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:46,910
What?

596
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:50,370
The blood god.

597
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:57,530
Okay, I'm just gonna drink this one, then, because it has more apple juice.

598
00:50:58,170 --> 00:50:58,890
That's like...

599
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:01,330
Yeah, this guy fucking goes around creating music.

600
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:02,190
It's crazy.

601
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:06,630
That's like...

602
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:07,630
It's just everything.

603
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,570
Like, you can gamble, too.

604
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:11,590
There's a casino in Rust.

605
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:13,230
Okay.

606
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:20,010
Love for the blood god, love for the blood god.

607
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,210
Praise be to the blood god.

608
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:23,170
Praise be.

609
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:24,970
Alright.

610
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:27,110
Keep signing.

611
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:28,270
I'm signing.

612
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:32,890
Praise be to the blood god.

613
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,010
I think you'd like the blood god.

614
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:36,370
That's a Warhammer.

615
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:40,070
Yeah, I think you'd like joining the blood god cult.

616
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:41,330
Oh, probably.

617
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:44,210
Yeah, I think you'd actually be their number one lieutenant.

618
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:47,930
I am the blood god.

619
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:49,250
You are the blood god.

620
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:52,410
I'm ascended into blood goddom.

621
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,410
You're reincarnated into it.

622
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:58,090
Yeah.

623
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:01,370
I wanna be the blood god.

624
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:04,630
Oh, sorry.

625
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:10,910
Sorry we're not playing video games from behind.

626
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:11,870
Yeah, sorry guys.

627
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:12,950
We're really behind.

628
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:18,030
If we had gotten these the first night, I think we would have been able to play the game.

629
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:18,370
I think so, too.

630
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:24,910
I really wanted us to play the Mario Party because I wanted us to be two and then two NPCs.

631
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,050
Because the computers are ruthless.

632
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:27,830
Oh, yeah.

633
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:28,190
I know.

634
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:28,650
I remember.

635
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:29,230
Yeah.

636
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,030
We can just play normal.

637
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:34,330
Let's make a collab with some people.

638
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:36,710
I wanna play with Doobie.

639
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:38,350
Oh, yeah.

640
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:39,650
You wanted to do...

641
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:40,510
Yeah, yeah.

642
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:41,630
Yeah, I wanna play with Doobie.

643
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:43,810
Yeah, she was talking about it with me.

644
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:44,170
Oh, okay.

645
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:44,450
Yeah.

646
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:46,210
Well, not that.

647
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:47,850
I said she as in you.

648
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:49,310
Oh, yeah.

649
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:51,330
I was like...

650
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:52,390
Well, I brought it up to her.

651
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:55,970
I was just like, do you want to play the Mario Party?

652
00:52:58,630 --> 00:52:59,430
So, maybe.

653
00:52:59,650 --> 00:52:59,950
We'll see.

654
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:05,670
We'll see whenever Doobie is adjusted to streaming again.

655
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:05,910
Yeah.

656
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:10,110
Oh, God.

657
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,270
Dokopon would take forever.

658
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:14,250
Dokopon would not...

659
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:14,390
What's Dokopon?

660
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:18,050
It's Mario Party, but if you actually want to lose friendships.

661
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:21,930
Okay, that just doesn't explain anything.

662
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:23,990
It's like more cruel Mario Party.

663
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,010
Like how?

664
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:28,910
Like, it is more cruel in what it takes away from you.

665
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:30,850
You know how it's just like, I took a star.

666
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:31,990
Like, no.

667
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:34,410
Dokopon will take away your life.

668
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:35,310
Like, it's just...

669
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:36,050
Like, how?

670
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:38,050
But it's also really long.

671
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:40,930
Like, sometimes it takes like a week.

672
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:41,670
We would have to like...

673
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:42,170
Wait, what?

674
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:44,230
I think the Sloppy Sisters would be good with it.

675
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:45,030
Oh, true.

676
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:45,530
Yeah.

677
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:49,610
Yeah, Dokopon is just flat out evil.

678
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,330
It's just really...

679
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:53,190
Why are we the Sloppy Sisters?

680
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:53,950
Why couldn't you be the Slop Squad?

681
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:58,810
It was like, earlier, Doki was like, I hate that name.

682
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:00,010
I hate the Sloppy...

683
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:01,470
I call us the Slop Squad.

684
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:03,750
And my chat's like, you mean the Sloppy Sisters?

685
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:10,750
Can't we be normal?

686
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:14,130
We're VTubers, we're not normal.

687
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,190
Can't we be normal?

688
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,710
We're already not normal, we're VTubers.

689
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:21,950
I just wanna be close.

690
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:24,430
I love being a Sloppy Sister.

691
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,210
I'm a Sloppy Sister.

692
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:34,890
I'm gonna make us a theme song.

693
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:35,570
Or do it.

694
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:38,010
We're gonna Slop, Slop, Slop.

695
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:39,490
The Sloppy Sisters.

696
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,810
Slop, Slop, Slop.

697
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:45,450
Stop ignoring me.

698
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:51,110
I want you to think about what you say.

699
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:52,690
What does that mean?

700
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:57,350
I want you to process your thoughts there.

701
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:02,310
You know when someone gives you bad food, it's Slop.

702
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:04,390
So we're bad people?

703
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:10,430
No, we're just like a Sloppy Joe, you know.

704
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:11,830
Why is it even called that?

705
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:13,750
Sloppy means messy.

706
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:14,990
We're messy cows.

707
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:18,590
The meat isn't even like a patty, it's literally just grounded meat.

708
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:19,930
We're just messy girls.

709
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:21,670
Have you never had a Sloppy Joe's?

710
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:23,330
No, I have, but I didn't know why.

711
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:28,470
Then you would know that it's not actually a patty, it's just grounded beef.

712
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:29,670
No, there is a patty.

713
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:30,210
No, it's not.

714
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,250
Yeah, it's a sandwich.

715
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:36,310
No, a Sloppy Joe is like a ground beef, instead of shaped into a patty.

716
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:37,210
It's not ground beef.

717
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:41,690
It's just like it's not shaped into a patty, it's literally just...

718
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:42,890
I think I'm thinking of barbecue.

719
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:44,130
You're not thinking of barbecue?

720
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:52,670
I think I'm thinking of like a barbecue sandwich.

721
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,450
Maybe I've never had a Sloppy Joe before.

722
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:04,490
I love being Sloppy's sister, but you don't even know it's like the...

723
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:06,050
No, Sloppy!

724
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:07,730
Okay, Sloppy is not just Sloppy Joe.

725
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:09,330
Sloppy also means messy.

726
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:10,450
It's a slang.

727
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,570
So we're the messy sisters.

728
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,050
Yeah, we're the messy sisters.

729
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,710
But like, what do you mean by that?

730
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:15,750
We're just messy.

731
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:17,170
Yeah, but what do you mean by that?

732
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:18,450
I mean, did you see our restaurant?

733
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:19,270
It was not clean.

734
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,550
Oh, true.

735
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:25,050
We're the messy gals.

736
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:29,650
Right, guys?

737
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:31,490
Don't encourage this.

738
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:34,650
I'm a mess.

739
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:36,590
My life, my afterlife is a mess.

740
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:37,590
Oh, I know.

741
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:41,730
You died because your Oshi graduated.

742
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:43,050
What?

743
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:44,470
What do you mean what?

744
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:45,990
That's literally your lore!

745
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:47,850
What are you talking about?

746
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,810
I actually don't even know how I died.

747
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:59,350
I just spawned in like a forest.

748
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:02,650
Oh, yeah, sorry.

749
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:03,290
Yeah.

750
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:07,910
You didn't even rewind your stream?

751
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:08,810
Is that it?

752
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:10,550
What do you mean?

753
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:12,530
What are you actually talking about?

754
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:16,970
Oh, she doesn't... Guys, now we know she doesn't even watch back her streams, guys.

755
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:19,590
I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.

756
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:21,290
Oh, yeah, you don't...

757
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:22,350
You don't watch your own streams?

758
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,370
Yeah, of course.

759
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:25,150
Just because I need to double check stuff.

760
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:27,350
I like getting embarrassed.

761
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:28,730
Why?

762
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:29,550
Why do you get embarrassed?

763
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:32,390
I watch back my own streams, especially because I know I'm funny.

764
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:37,570
You don't make yourself laugh?

765
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:38,450
No!

766
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:39,510
What?

767
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:41,190
I don't know why they think I'm funny.

768
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:42,410
Do you guys think I'm funny?

769
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:45,690
Okay, now you're just like trying to get your ego stroked.

770
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:50,410
Maybe because I'm in front of you.

771
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:54,650
Yes.

772
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:57,030
Do you think frog bird's funny?

773
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:00,550
Frog bird.

774
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:01,810
Where's croaky?

775
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:03,170
It's just me.

776
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:04,310
Hello, I'm croaky.

777
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:08,910
Hey, guys, it's croaky.

778
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:21,050
Oh, yeah, I showed Mint my nendoroid.

779
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:21,910
Oh, yeah.

780
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:22,930
I showed it to her.

781
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:24,410
We got updates of it.

782
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:25,110
I saw it.

783
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:25,690
I saw it.

784
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:27,870
Don't know leaks on the parts.

785
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:31,090
You kind of just leaked.

786
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:33,250
No, I said no leaks on the parts.

787
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,690
I don't know what parts are in it.

788
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:35,090
Yeah.

789
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:36,510
Yeah.

790
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:38,090
Sure.

791
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:39,630
I won't say anything.

792
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:41,630
Don't leak your own parts, though.

793
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:42,670
I won't.

794
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:47,230
I'm almost done with my pile.

795
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:48,050
No, you're not.

796
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:48,870
Look at this pile.

797
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:49,490
That is done.

798
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:50,470
You have to do numbers.

799
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:52,890
Oh, I know, but this is actual signature.

800
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:53,690
What the fuck?

801
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:56,590
Thank God.

802
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:57,610
I'm almost done with my pile.

803
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:01,430
I wish we could show the pile, but then we'd be doxing the postcard.

804
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:04,090
Yeah, we can't show how many postcards there are.

805
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:05,970
Because it would reveal the art.

806
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:07,230
Or what the postcards are.

807
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:07,750
Yeah, the art of the postcards.

808
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:08,810
The art's really cute, though.

809
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:09,570
It's really cute.

810
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:11,010
We have outfits for it.

811
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:11,410
Yeah.

812
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:12,170
It's cute.

813
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:13,050
We're idols.

814
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:13,710
Yeah.

815
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:14,550
In the outfits.

816
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:15,350
Yeah.

817
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:16,210
In the postcard.

818
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:16,930
I don't know about that.

819
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:19,990
Now you're revealing more and more about the postcard.

820
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,490
You said we have outfits, though.

821
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:22,070
We have outfits.

822
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,310
It could have been any outfit.

823
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:25,310
But...

824
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:25,990
Yeah.

825
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:28,910
I don't think we're idols on that stage.

826
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:31,830
What do you mean?

827
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,390
Okay, when you saw that one song...

828
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:36,310
That one song...

829
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:38,930
That was really good.

830
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:44,310
I was thinking my dance lessons definitely paid off there.

831
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:45,450
Oh, yeah, yeah.

832
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:45,630
Yeah.

833
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:50,990
Leaking.

834
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:52,630
No, we're not leaking anything.

835
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:56,110
We're hinting so that you can be like...

836
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:56,830
You get curious.

837
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,410
You're like, what could they be talking about?

838
00:59:58,710 --> 00:59:59,950
I must go to the concert.

839
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,770
In Atlanta, Georgia.

840
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:05,970
On December 14th.

841
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:06,950
Yeah.

842
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:08,910
At the Tabernacle Atlanta, Georgia.

843
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:10,750
Also, if you can't make it, do not worry.

844
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:14,410
We're planning on uploading, like, clips of our favorite performances.

845
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:15,070
Yeah.

846
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:16,750
Yeah, so don't worry.

847
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:18,030
So there will be clips.

848
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,630
But try and make it if you can.

849
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:21,270
Yeah, yeah.

850
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:23,070
Because it's not going to be the full concert.

851
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:25,170
Yeah, try and make it if you can.

852
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:28,110
Yeah, so, like, we would really appreciate it.

853
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:34,530
Because if you guys come to the concert, it'll give us more opportunities in the future to have some more similar stuff.

854
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:35,150
More similar stuff.

855
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:40,750
So if you guys want more concerts from us, like, you know, it really means a lot if you guys come to the concert.

856
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:42,370
Or Mint's going to cry.

857
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:43,350
I will.

858
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:44,890
She will cry on stage.

859
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:48,930
Actually, I think they'll enjoy it.

860
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:50,510
No.

861
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:52,010
They'll enjoy it.

862
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:53,570
Actually, they might enjoy it.

863
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:58,150
Okay, if you guys come to the concert, or she won't cry on stage.

864
01:00:58,850 --> 01:00:59,290
No!

865
01:00:59,650 --> 01:00:59,870
That's right.

866
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:01,570
She'll withhold her tears.

867
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:03,630
Unless you come to the concert.

868
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:05,830
There will be a full fan recording as well.

869
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:07,510
We figured it out today.

870
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:08,110
Oh, shit.

871
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:08,570
I'll cry.

872
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:10,530
Well, still come if you can.

873
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,710
Still come, because it won't be... it's not the same.

874
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:16,890
No, that...

875
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:18,570
Like...

876
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:23,890
I know, we're like in between being like, you know, don't...

877
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:26,170
It's fine, but also like...

878
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:30,530
It'll make us really happy, and then we'll have more opportunities in the future.

879
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:35,250
And then maybe those opportunities will let us have streaming tickets in the future, you know, guys?

880
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:41,370
Like, it gives us a chance to have streaming tickets in our next concert, if we ever do a next one.

881
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:45,410
Like I say, in our next concert, as if we're definitely going to do a next one, but we don't even know.

882
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:46,230
We don't even know.

883
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:47,890
Like, we only have this one.

884
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:55,110
So, if it goes well, that means like, you know, we're worth investing in for concerts, guys.

885
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:55,550
Yeah, exactly.

886
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,990
They'll be like, oh, we gotta bring these girls back.

887
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:01,550
Yeah, we gotta bring these girls back to do more concerts.

888
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:05,070
With maybe more guests, maybe other 3D guests.

889
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:10,370
Also, we're all just like, like saying like, hypothetically, we do... there's no plans.

890
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:10,930
Yeah.

891
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:11,950
Like...

892
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:13,990
We're just... we're dreaming big, you guys.

893
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:14,750
We're dreaming big.

894
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,390
Some deep concert goes well!

895
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:20,290
This is like the hardest we've ever shilled anything, I think.

896
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:21,230
I know, I know.

897
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,770
That's like the hardest we've ever...

898
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:25,030
People don't listen to us.

899
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:25,810
We're like literally...

900
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:27,010
We're actually fake.

901
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,490
This is so sad.

902
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:35,850
Because we want to have more... like more... like, have a chance to have like streaming tickets next time.

903
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:36,190
Yeah.

904
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:42,050
So like, we want to do another concert in the future so we can actually provide streaming tickets for those who can't make it.

905
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:43,690
Because we worked really hard on this one.

906
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:45,690
This person said, get Doobie for the next concert.

907
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:46,990
We have Doobie for this concert!

908
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,470
We have Doobie for this one!

909
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:51,930
Like, what?!

910
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:58,110
That's so funny.

911
01:02:58,290 --> 01:02:59,690
Oh my god, Doobie was like...

912
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:01,250
I wanna do the worm.

913
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:03,970
Oh, hell yeah.

914
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:06,770
I wanna see Doobie do the worm.

915
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:08,590
I wanna see Doobie do the worm too.

916
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,330
Doobie do the worm.

917
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:15,430
We don't know what she's gonna do.

918
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:16,990
No.

919
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:20,930
It was just us two at the rehearsals.

920
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:21,550
Yeah.

921
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:22,230
Yeah.

922
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:24,130
So, Doobie's gonna doob.

923
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:25,750
Whatever she doobing was.

924
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:28,330
And she's gonna doob what she wants to doob.

925
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:28,750
Yeah.

926
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:30,490
She's gonna doob it.

927
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:32,210
I love her name.

928
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:33,830
I know, it's so fun to say.

929
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:34,850
I'm doobing it.

930
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:35,570
Is this mine?

931
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:38,570
I don't...

932
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:39,610
I don't know.

933
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:40,890
I'm gonna drink it.

934
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:41,810
Yeah, it's fine.

935
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:43,510
I'm not the sickie here.

936
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:48,730
Guys, if Min gets sick, I'm sorry.

937
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:51,310
I don't know if I'm sick, that's the thing.

938
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:52,670
I don't think you are.

939
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:53,650
I'm just coughing a little bit.

940
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:55,410
Yeah, but you were blowing your nose too.

941
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:57,510
No, every time I stream, I blow my nose.

942
01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:02,690
Because, like, every stream I blow my nose because I talk so much that, like, the saliva...

943
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:04,630
Not saliva, my nose gets congested.

944
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:05,170
Oh.

945
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:07,210
It's like a medical thing.

946
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:08,330
And I...

947
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:09,450
I actually...

948
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:10,990
It's not serious, but...

949
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:14,750
I have such a consistent runny nose, I actually think it's brain fluid.

950
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:16,550
No wonder.

951
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:19,690
Which is, like, apparently an actual reason...

952
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:22,890
Sometimes the reason that your nose is running is that you...

953
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:23,390
Wait, really?

954
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:25,490
Yeah, I looked it up because I was like...

955
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:25,910
What?

956
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:29,070
I was like, why is my nose actually always so runny?

957
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,050
Wait, what?

958
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:31,430
How is brain fluid...

959
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:32,650
How is brain fluid...

960
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:34,470
It's, like, leaking through.

961
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,510
No, you're fucking with me, there's no way.

962
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:38,770
No, I'm dead serious.

963
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:39,950
Because I have that...

964
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:41,650
Oh, no, is that why I'm getting more stupid?

965
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:43,230
That's why we're dumb.

966
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:45,350
Wait, no, don't say that, guys.

967
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:46,630
Okay, wait, let's chat thing.

968
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:49,630
Google doctor.

969
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:51,410
I googled it.

970
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:55,730
No, there was, like, some specific stuff about it, but I was just like...

971
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:56,290
There's no way, no one will say that.

972
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:57,830
And I was like, um...

973
01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:00,770
No, I actually should go to a doctor about this because I...

974
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:02,650
I was like, this is getting weird.

975
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:04,450
So, I...

976
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:07,190
I've had this for, like, years, but it's only when I stream.

977
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:11,550
No, my nose never stops running, actually.

978
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:13,570
But it's only also in one nostril.

979
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:14,190
Oh, okay.

980
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:18,330
So, I think it's, like, dripping through that nostril from my brain.

981
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:19,810
Oh.

982
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:20,590
Yeah.

983
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:22,430
That's not good.

984
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:23,730
Yeah.

985
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:27,990
It's like when you try to Google what's wrong with you and you get cancer.

986
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:29,030
I know.

987
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:35,030
Literally losing brain cells as you stream.

988
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:36,170
I mean, it explains everything.

989
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:36,610
Yeah.

990
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:38,250
I used to be really smart.

991
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:44,290
If I go to heaven, I'll use this as my testimony on why I went to heaven.

992
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:45,770
Oh, because you're stupid?

993
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:47,550
No, brain fluid.

994
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:50,050
I think my marker's starting to die.

995
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:52,010
We have more, but, like, it's thinner.

996
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:53,410
I think it's this one.

997
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:54,350
This is the bad one.

998
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:56,070
Yeah, it's the thin... No, that's the gold one.

999
01:05:56,210 --> 01:05:56,870
That's gold.

1000
01:05:57,210 --> 01:05:57,990
Oh, you're right.

1001
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:59,930
This is a really thin one.

1002
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:00,990
Oh, let me try.

1003
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,410
Can you hand me the test one?

1004
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:03,210
Yeah.

1005
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:05,230
Thank you.

1006
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:06,430
We should auction that off.

1007
01:06:07,850 --> 01:06:09,270
Oh, no, because this one was dry.

1008
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:09,930
Oh, yeah.

1009
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:12,590
Well, hold on.

1010
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:13,470
Oh, no.

1011
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:14,230
It's pretty dry.

1012
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:16,050
Just kidding.

1013
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:18,950
Yeah, the others are gold.

1014
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:22,450
Don't you taste it for us and see if it's brain fluid.

1015
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,530
God, your chat is so damn bad.

1016
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:29,530
Uh...

1017
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:32,730
I don't know why.

1018
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:34,950
What do you mean you don't know why?

1019
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:36,450
Yes, you do.

1020
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:36,970
Why?

1021
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:38,370
Yes, you do.

1022
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:39,230
Why?

1023
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:39,890
What's that?

1024
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:41,350
Oh, let me look at your Twitter replies.

1025
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:42,970
What's my Twitter replies?

1026
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:44,310
Let me look at your Twitter replies.

1027
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:47,870
Okay, I don't know why I tried with this one again.

1028
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:54,430
It's so thin, and it's so weak.

1029
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:57,470
Maybe we can ask them to give us more markers.

1030
01:06:57,730 --> 01:06:59,830
But we literally just asked them for these ones.

1031
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:01,750
Yeah, but what time is it?

1032
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:03,570
We're down bad for you, Doki.

1033
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:04,770
Oh, my God.

1034
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:06,270
No, I know why.

1035
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:07,170
Get a room.

1036
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:13,410
Get out of my chat if you're going to just propose to Doki over and over again.

1037
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:16,870
I'm tired.

1038
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:18,770
I'm so tired.

1039
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:19,370
Maybe one day.

1040
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:22,010
Maybe one day they'll start proposing to you.

1041
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:24,050
Actually, this one got better the more I used it.

1042
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:24,470
Uh-oh.

1043
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:26,710
Maybe I should have been using this one from the start.

1044
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:28,510
And I'm almost done even.

1045
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,270
You know, you still have to number them.

1046
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:33,010
I know, but that's with silver.

1047
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:36,050
I gave you the silver, right?

1048
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:37,670
You're not going to help me number them?

1049
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:38,090
No.

1050
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:40,430
But your handwriting is nicer than mine.

1051
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:41,050
No, it's not.

1052
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:41,830
You know that.

1053
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:42,990
No, it's not.

1054
01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:43,730
It is actually.

1055
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:44,450
No, it's not.

1056
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:45,770
No, it's not.

1057
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:47,630
My handwriting fucking sucks.

1058
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:49,370
Please marry me, AI Minto.

1059
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:51,450
Oh, yeah, the AI.

1060
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:54,310
What does AI Mint say?

1061
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:56,090
Oh, you have to have an account, and I don't have one.

1062
01:07:57,150 --> 01:08:00,290
Oh my god, this one is so much nicer than the one I've been using.

1063
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:01,070
Wait, really?

1064
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:01,690
Yes.

1065
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:03,910
Oh, did you have to like...

1066
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:05,910
Lift up the pile to a random one?

1067
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:10,050
What's wrong with this one?

1068
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:10,790
It's just thick.

1069
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:13,010
It's like more shiny, see?

1070
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:14,130
Oh, wait, it is.

1071
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:14,450
Yeah.

1072
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:15,070
Want to trade?

1073
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:16,910
No, I'm almost done.

1074
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:18,510
I'm sorry, guys.

1075
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:19,970
Guys, it's gotcha.

1076
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:24,750
It's literally gotcha.

1077
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:26,850
I don't know if mine...

1078
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:28,650
This one was so bad at first, though.

1079
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:29,830
Yeah, but then it got really good.

1080
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:30,770
But then you gave love to it.

1081
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:32,690
This is what happens when you, you know, start loving...

1082
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:33,930
I love it and nurture it.

1083
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:34,330
Yeah.

1084
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:35,430
Yeah.

1085
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:36,190
Okay, I'm...

1086
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:38,330
I know you don't know what that feels like.

1087
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:39,950
I'm turning over a new leaf, guys.

1088
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:42,130
I'll be nice to you now.

1089
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:43,590
That's a cap.

1090
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:45,690
What the...

1091
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:46,710
That's a cap.

1092
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,110
Come here, fan art of you.

1093
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:49,970
Wait, I want to see it.

1094
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:53,530
Come here.

1095
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:55,390
Look!

1096
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:56,690
Sorry, Doki.

1097
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:57,370
I'm just hiding.

1098
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:00,390
Why are we...

1099
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:01,230
Why is it eggs?

1100
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:03,730
Wait, why is it eggs?

1101
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:04,230
What is...

1102
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:05,210
Wait a minute.

1103
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:06,490
Why is it eggs?

1104
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:08,530
What does that mean?

1105
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:10,610
Oh, look at this, too.

1106
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:11,010
Oh!

1107
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:13,450
Wait, I like how I caught...

1108
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:14,950
Then he's like...

1109
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,230
You bullied Kame.

1110
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:17,950
That's so mean.

1111
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:27,050
I'm sorry.

1112
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:29,010
Yeah, you better be.

1113
01:09:29,070 --> 01:09:29,870
Thanks for the art.

1114
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:31,530
She's my baby.

1115
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:32,530
Thanks for the art.

1116
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:33,910
Guys!

1117
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:34,710
Guys!

1118
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:35,850
Peer pressure works!

1119
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:37,130
Okay.

1120
01:09:37,530 --> 01:09:38,170
Time to number.

1121
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:39,950
That's when you know.

1122
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,190
I'm going to try out your marker.

1123
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:42,210
Peer pressure works, guys.

1124
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:42,710
No, no, no.

1125
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:43,150
It's this one.

1126
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:43,570
This one?

1127
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:43,950
Okay.

1128
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:45,530
I think so.

1129
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:47,390
That just, like, proves my point.

1130
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:48,030
Yeah.

1131
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:48,810
This one sucks.

1132
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:50,730
This one's bad.

1133
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:52,790
Okay!

1134
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:55,470
Time to number.

1135
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:01,210
Where's the old one?

1136
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:03,390
I put the silver...

1137
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:04,170
I gave the silver to you.

1138
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:07,110
No, I mean, like, the ones that...

1139
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:07,550
What?

1140
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:09,350
No, I gave you the old silver.

1141
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:09,670
No, no, no.

1142
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:10,790
I'm not talking about...

1143
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:12,190
I'm talking about...

1144
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:12,350
Oh, wait.

1145
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:13,270
No, it's in there.

1146
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:14,190
No, it's in here.

1147
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:14,510
It's here.

1148
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:16,210
No, I'm saying these.

1149
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:16,950
Oh!

1150
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:17,570
Yeah.

1151
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:18,130
Oh, yeah.

1152
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:19,130
I gave them to you.

1153
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:19,990
Okay.

1154
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:22,670
Oh, my God.

1155
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:24,110
This is...

1156
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:24,130
Alright.

1157
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:26,730
I have a lot more to go on my own.

1158
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:35,090
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

1159
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:36,310
Okay.

1160
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,910
Alright, we're on number eleven.

1161
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:40,030
Baby!

1162
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:45,590
I'll give this to you since I finished them.

1163
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:46,450
What?

1164
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:47,110
These.

1165
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:48,350
These are all the finished ones.

1166
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:49,930
Oh, my goodness.

1167
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:50,330
These.

1168
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:56,750
I need to go blow my nose.

1169
01:10:58,310 --> 01:10:59,870
Come over to the mic.

1170
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:00,330
No.

1171
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:02,110
See, guys.

1172
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:03,770
She doesn't love you.

1173
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:06,090
Fine, I'll do it to the mic.

1174
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:09,790
You know what that means.

1175
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,010
Here we go, guys.

1176
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:12,050
I'm going to blow my nose.

1177
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:15,990
That's it.

1178
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:17,570
That's so weak.

1179
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:21,370
It's the brain fluid.

1180
01:11:22,010 --> 01:11:23,890
How are they going to Toskaroo that?

1181
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:25,110
Brain fluid?

1182
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:26,230
I sneezed.

1183
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:27,890
I gave them a real show, okay?

1184
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:30,730
That's not what the wimpy blow right there.

1185
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:33,510
No, a sneeze is the real show.

1186
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:37,110
See, they're still saying Toskaroo.

1187
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:38,130
One big boom.

1188
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:38,870
Boom!

1189
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:42,770
Oh, my God.

1190
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,330
We brought it back.

1191
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:49,930
Wait.

1192
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:50,290
Okay.

1193
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:52,030
I need more space.

1194
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:52,470
Okay.

1195
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:54,050
Boom.

1196
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:55,270
Boom.

1197
01:11:58,650 --> 01:11:59,750
Certified boom.

1198
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:05,890
Well, guys, know that I am numbering every single one of these with love.

1199
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:06,810
Okay?

1200
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:09,090
Because now I love you guys.

1201
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:09,710
Whoa.

1202
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:14,430
Since otherwise, if I don't love you guys, you will find someone else.

1203
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:15,970
Guys, I'm here.

1204
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:20,610
You guys will create creatures.

1205
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:23,430
You guys will create horrible things.

1206
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:26,390
That's someone else right here, guys.

1207
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:28,250
No, they don't need you anymore.

1208
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:28,710
They don't need you anymore.

1209
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:33,170
My channel is YouTube at Doki Bird.

1210
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:35,590
Use Gamersups code Boomer.

1211
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:38,170
Oh, hey.

1212
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:40,690
This is what...

1213
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:41,010
Hey.

1214
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:41,550
What?

1215
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:42,250
Ow!

1216
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:42,730
Ow!

1217
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:44,870
Oh, my God.

1218
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:46,450
Why did you punch me?

1219
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:47,310
You know why.

1220
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:48,490
Wait, what did it say?

1221
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:49,410
You know why.

1222
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:52,250
Oh, my God.

1223
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:53,490
You know why.

1224
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:54,130
Why did you punch me?

1225
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:56,230
This is actually abusive relationship.

1226
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:57,450
I bet like...

1227
01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:59,210
They're watching right now.

1228
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:01,350
I'm gonna kill that guy.

1229
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:06,230
Fucking Kana Udo requested that Doki punch me in the shoulder.

1230
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:08,570
I'm literally going to kill you.

1231
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:10,670
I will...

1232
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:13,430
I will send you to hell.

1233
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:18,590
Okay, let me reply to this.

1234
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:23,450
This is...

1235
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:23,970
This is...

1236
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:26,370
I just get abused every day, everybody.

1237
01:13:26,590 --> 01:13:28,890
This is why I'm so angry all the time.

1238
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:33,830
Actually, can you like hit my back one more time?

1239
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:35,450
Because not as hard as you did.

1240
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:37,050
But like not as hard as you did.

1241
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:37,450
Ow!

1242
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:38,590
I said not as hard.

1243
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:39,090
Oh, sorry.

1244
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:39,970
That wasn't as hard.

1245
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:45,970
That feels good.

1246
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:51,330
Every punch is a punch for you, Wisp.

1247
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:56,050
Jesus Christ, I'm like your chiropractor.

1248
01:13:57,770 --> 01:14:00,050
I told you, I'm sore.

1249
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,690
She's so stressed out.

1250
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:04,530
That felt good.

1251
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:07,110
Are you a...

1252
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:08,690
Are you an M?

1253
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:12,530
I think I'm a switch.

1254
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:13,530
You're a switch?

1255
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:19,650
Alright.

1256
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:23,130
Sometimes it's fun to be the one inflicting the pain.

1257
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:28,130
Maybe.

1258
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:29,390
What's your chat?

1259
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:30,770
Are they M or S?

1260
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:31,890
What are you guys?

1261
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:36,990
I think there's various because sometimes I say things and they're like, yo, mint, I'm not into that.

1262
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:39,990
Yo, hold.

1263
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:40,570
Hold.

1264
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:41,610
Hold.

1265
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:46,590
They're literally timing me out.

1266
01:14:46,670 --> 01:14:47,890
They're like, yo, man.

1267
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:51,350
Bro, I only see you as a bro, dude.

1268
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:53,610
That's fine.

1269
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:54,590
We're all bros here.

1270
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:57,330
I thought this was supposed to be my bro-tuber.

1271
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:58,010
What happened?

1272
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,170
Yeah, we're the bros.

1273
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:09,190
Hey, have him message me instead because you need to sign.

1274
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:10,750
What?

1275
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:12,850
You don't even have him.

1276
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:13,850
Oh, I don't?

1277
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:16,250
Yeah, because I was like, do you have him?

1278
01:15:16,410 --> 01:15:17,630
And you were like, no.

1279
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:19,250
No, you asked me about someone else.

1280
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:20,850
No, I asked you about...

1281
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,190
Oh, it's TikTok.

1282
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:25,110
I had TikTok up, sorry.

1283
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:36,490
We're talking about Kanaru because we want to ask Kanaru about something regarding 3D stuff.

1284
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:40,110
No, but you asked for someone else.

1285
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:43,210
No, no, in the past when we first asked him to do something else.

1286
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:45,650
Remember?

1287
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:46,970
And I was like, do you have him?

1288
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:47,510
He was like, no.

1289
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:50,550
Oh, I don't have Discord now, I don't think.

1290
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:50,930
Yeah.

1291
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:52,190
Yeah, see?

1292
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:56,590
You're like, y'all haven't messaged me.

1293
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:58,670
And I was like, you don't even have him.

1294
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:00,610
Yeah, good.

1295
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:03,330
Yeah, that's why you get hit.

1296
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:08,030
Oh, sorry, I went back to TikTok.

1297
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:13,150
She's so brain-rotted from TikTok.

1298
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:16,450
It's a TikTok about Disney.

1299
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:17,590
Yeah.

1300
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:19,910
You're so brain-rotted.

1301
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:22,070
That's literally brain-rot.

1302
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:22,650
Maybe.

1303
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:23,870
Hold on, let me show you.

1304
01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:26,050
Okay, I'll show you some funny TikToks.

1305
01:16:26,610 --> 01:16:27,190
Look at this one.

1306
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:27,950
What's this?

1307
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:34,570
Guys, this is not a reaction.

1308
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:40,190
But you can't see the video.

1309
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:45,490
She's literally making me react right now.

1310
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:51,870
She's literally trying to make me react.

1311
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:54,870
But with no video.

1312
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:01,490
You don't need a video.

1313
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:03,790
The creature.

1314
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:07,350
I think there was a video for this.

1315
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:10,310
Yes, the creature was a cow.

1316
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:11,330
Reaction over.

1317
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:15,530
Sorry, I think it's scary.

1318
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:18,730
Look at this.

1319
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:21,010
But sometimes I get really good ideas from TikTok.

1320
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:22,350
I want to do this.

1321
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:23,910
Look at this.

1322
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:25,270
So, it's a postcard.

1323
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:27,590
Look at this.

1324
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:32,690
Wouldn't that make really cool merch?

1325
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:33,990
Wait, how do they do that?

1326
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:34,470
I know!

1327
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:38,830
How do they do that?

1328
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:39,650
Isn't that crazy?

1329
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:40,650
That's crazy.

1330
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:42,650
You guys, I get good ideas from TikTok, okay?

1331
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:43,630
Guys, we're reacting.

1332
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:47,410
Don't say what it is though.

1333
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:50,050
No, they don't.

1334
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:51,690
Oh, it does say where it's from though.

1335
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:56,010
Yeah, you can literally get that manufacturer.

1336
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:57,730
Because they credit it.

1337
01:17:57,870 --> 01:17:58,350
Yeah, I know.

1338
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:05,850
It's really down bad merch.

1339
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:09,430
Yeah, but it would be cool.

1340
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:12,110
There's something there that can be used, you know?

1341
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:14,690
But when would you ever put it there?

1342
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:17,870
What's the context?

1343
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:18,710
I don't know.

1344
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:20,370
It's a novelty item.

1345
01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:22,490
That's true.

1346
01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:24,710
You're just feeling a little wild that day.

1347
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:27,710
It's just every day.

1348
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:30,990
Every day I'm feeling wild.

1349
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:34,210
What am I on?

1350
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:35,050
029.

1351
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:45,570
We're doing our best here.

1352
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:47,070
I signed all my postcards.

1353
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:49,590
I'm trying my best here.

1354
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:52,970
Wait, there's this too?

1355
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:54,070
Yes.

1356
01:18:55,810 --> 01:18:58,350
Oh my god, it got bigger in this pile.

1357
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:01,290
Yeah, because I signed postcards.

1358
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:04,290
Oh my god.

1359
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:14,590
I think once I sign this, or once I number these, it's gotta be it.

1360
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:19,130
Yeah, there's a lot.

1361
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:22,130
Doki is really behind you guys.

1362
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:22,450
It's okay.

1363
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:23,830
It's a giant pile.

1364
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:29,090
Say some motivating things in the chat for Doki Bird signing.

1365
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:32,390
Okay, then you have to read it out loud because I'm not looking at it right now.

1366
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:33,870
I'm fucking trying to sign here.

1367
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:35,670
She's trying to sign here.

1368
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:39,050
Okay, if you're going to ask them to give me motivation words, you gotta read it.

1369
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:39,970
You can win.

1370
01:19:40,090 --> 01:19:40,870
You feel great.

1371
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:41,810
You can do it, Doki.

1372
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,230
We believe in her.

1373
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:45,810
Think about Apex.

1374
01:19:46,210 --> 01:19:46,890
Love Doki.

1375
01:19:47,070 --> 01:19:48,110
Doki can do this.

1376
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,010
Keep it up, Doki.

1377
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:49,950
You got this.

1378
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:51,590
Doki, you're smarter than me.

1379
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:52,210
Wait a second.

1380
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,050
Go, Doki Bird.

1381
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:57,890
I definitely feel motivated after that person.

1382
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:01,810
You will make it.

1383
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:04,330
Okay, I'm not dying, guys.

1384
01:20:04,450 --> 01:20:07,150
I'm not dying.

1385
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:10,950
I feel like you're like, oh my god, she's gonna die.

1386
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:16,350
This Sharpie is not great.

1387
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:18,810
I need another silver Sharpie, please.

1388
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:23,550
Wait, what color was that?

1389
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:27,890
That was exactly the silver.

1390
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:34,010
That's funny.

1391
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:38,890
Guys, I hope you guys like my set list.

1392
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:40,490
Because Mint doesn't.

1393
01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:42,150
Thoughts and prayers for Doki.

1394
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:43,730
Mint doesn't like my set list.

1395
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:46,990
Okay, keep signing and don't care about your set list right now.

1396
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:47,750
What do you mean?

1397
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:50,330
She criticized my set list.

1398
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:55,570
She criticized my set list and then like, made me sad.

1399
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:56,530
Oh my god.

1400
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:59,210
You criticized my intelligence and made me sad.

1401
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:00,830
Okay, like...

1402
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:03,530
One is not the same.

1403
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:06,330
Why would the truth make you sad?

1404
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:08,750
Oh, there we go.

1405
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:09,990
See, everybody?

1406
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:11,690
This is what I have to deal with.

1407
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,430
I thought you wanted to be cute.

1408
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:17,470
Don't you want to be cute?

1409
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:18,830
No.

1410
01:21:19,130 --> 01:21:19,570
Okay.

1411
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:22,170
I just want my Oshis to be cute.

1412
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:27,190
If they're cute, then it's nothing matters.

1413
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:31,270
You're dead anyway, so like...

1414
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:34,430
I'm ugly because my Oshis are cuter.

1415
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:40,150
They had to steal the points of cuteness.

1416
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:41,330
I'm my own Oshi.

1417
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:48,830
Wait, this one's leaky.

1418
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:50,570
It's really wet.

1419
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:55,550
Oh my gosh, why did I get a damn decent pen around here?

1420
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:03,020
They gave us so many, and I don't understand how they're all good.

1421
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:03,780
I know, I'm struggling with all of them.

1422
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:06,920
Yeah, they're all like semi-bad.

1423
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:11,200
Like, I don't want it to leak onto the next one.

1424
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:13,220
Okay, what about Garfield?

1425
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,920
I am my own non-cat Oshi.

1426
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:29,950
Oh guys, you know like Min was saying how she wanted to be...

1427
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:30,870
What's his name?

1428
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:34,510
She wanted to be that guy in Garfield.

1429
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:37,850
That guy in the oven.

1430
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:39,630
You're like, I want to be the guy in the oven.

1431
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:41,730
I don't think that was on stream.

1432
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:42,990
I know, I know.

1433
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:44,650
But like, we were talking about...

1434
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:45,550
But like, what's his name again?

1435
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:46,410
Lyman.

1436
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:48,490
She wants to be Lyman.

1437
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:50,310
Yeah, I was just like, who can I be?

1438
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:51,550
I'll be Lyman.

1439
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:52,370
Is it Liam?

1440
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:54,150
No, it's Lyman.

1441
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:55,470
His name is Lyman?

1442
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:56,110
Lyman.

1443
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:58,730
The guy, he was locked in the basement.

1444
01:22:58,730 --> 01:23:01,050
She's talking about the Halloween Garfield game.

1445
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:02,970
I never realized like, how to pronounce.

1446
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,150
Also, she doesn't even know who Nermal is.

1447
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:06,410
I was like, no, you should be Nermal.

1448
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:08,150
And then she was like, who's Nermal?

1449
01:23:08,210 --> 01:23:09,550
I was like, Nermal's hot.

1450
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:13,310
She's like, Nermal's, she's so hot.

1451
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:14,550
I was like, she's a guy.

1452
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:19,270
I don't know Garfield lore, you guys, okay?

1453
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:20,470
Sue me, okay?

1454
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:23,310
Guys, I told you guys, nobody's perfect.

1455
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:25,510
Yeah, exactly.

1456
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:30,130
She judged me for not knowing like, Metal Gear references, but she barely knows anything about Garfield.

1457
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:32,610
Okay, but Metal Gear is like, very impactful.

1458
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:34,690
Oh, and Garfield isn't?

1459
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:35,530
You're a gamer.

1460
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:38,890
How is Garfield not impactful?

1461
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:40,610
Garfield is not gaming.

1462
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:42,370
Garfield is like, life.

1463
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:44,710
Garfield is not gaming.

1464
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:47,470
Garfield is literally everywhere.

1465
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:48,910
So is Metal Gear.

1466
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:49,730
Okay.

1467
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:50,690
If you look.

1468
01:23:53,150 --> 01:23:55,690
At least Funko Pops has Garfield.

1469
01:23:56,290 --> 01:24:01,810
Oh, I'm not crying that Funko Pops has Garfield and not Metal Gear.

1470
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:06,630
Yeah, if you go to a Hot Topic, you'd find Garfield stuff.

1471
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,390
If I go to a Hot Topic, I wouldn't find Metal Gear.

1472
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:11,390
I don't know, I think you might find Metal Gear now.

1473
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:13,390
No, we gotta go to a Hot Topic.

1474
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:15,970
That would require me going to a Hot Topic.

1475
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:23,520
Garfield.

1476
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:25,960
I'm not dissing Garfield.

1477
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,300
Garfield has an amusement park.

1478
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:29,300
Really?

1479
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:29,780
Yeah.

1480
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:34,220
Wait, no, it was the Garfield Dark Ride that people were having sex on.

1481
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:35,040
Wait, what?

1482
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:35,660
Yes.

1483
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:39,760
Oh, you don't know about this Garfield sex ride?

1484
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:44,760
Because, like, that's against the Garfield rules.

1485
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:48,380
That's illegal.

1486
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:55,080
Okay, so dark rides are just notorious for people having sex on them.

1487
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,520
And for some reason, the Garfield one...

1488
01:24:58,520 --> 01:24:59,900
And why do you know this?

1489
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,760
Because I watch a bunch of stuff about amusement parks.

1490
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:05,220
Wait, was it from, what was it called?

1491
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:06,020
Defunctland?

1492
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:07,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1493
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:09,160
Wait, that was from Defunctland?

1494
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:09,980
Yeah.

1495
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:10,960
Bro, what?

1496
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:17,920
And they got stories from people being like, yeah, in my teens I went on the Garfield ride and got a little frisky with my girl.

1497
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:20,860
Like, people were admitting to it.

1498
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:22,660
Damn.

1499
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:24,860
Yeah.

1500
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:25,960
That's why they closed it down.

1501
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:26,400
No.

1502
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,240
That's why they closed it down.

1503
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:29,780
They should have been arrested.

1504
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:30,620
How dare they?

1505
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:31,340
Zero?

1506
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:31,840
Fifteen?

1507
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:39,500
How dare they not pay attention to the Garfield lore and just do all that scandalous things.

1508
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,360
Tarnish the reputation of Garfield.

1509
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:44,140
Wait, so John doesn't fuck?

1510
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,860
I don't think so.

1511
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,280
Did you watch Lasagna Cat?

1512
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:51,180
What?

1513
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:54,820
Are you a real Garfield fan?

1514
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:55,760
Lasagna Cat?

1515
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:57,960
Wait, no, wait.

1516
01:25:58,340 --> 01:25:59,620
Oh, no.

1517
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:01,900
Wait, I might know it.

1518
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:03,240
I just didn't know the name of it.

1519
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:07,680
It's like the live action, it's a YouTube channel.

1520
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:10,680
Like, yeah, people are calling you a fake fan.

1521
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:11,380
No, I know it.

1522
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:13,820
It's like the one where... No, I know it.

1523
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,320
I just didn't know the channel name.

1524
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,580
It goes really trippy, right?

1525
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:22,640
And then at one point it repeats John doing the same thing over and over again.

1526
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:23,360
You know, I know.

1527
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,200
See, I know my Garfield shit.

1528
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:26,040
Yeah, but you didn't know the name.

1529
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,340
I didn't know the name of it.

1530
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:29,200
And you didn't know the name of it.

1531
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,160
I didn't know the name.

1532
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:31,020
I know it.

1533
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:32,400
I just forgot the name of it.

1534
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:33,980
I watched almost... Oh, shit.

1535
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:35,060
Oh, no.

1536
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:36,320
You don't even know Nermal.

1537
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:36,820
Oh, no.

1538
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:37,200
Oh, no.

1539
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:37,960
60.

1540
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,520
Sorry, whoever gets 60, I messed it up.

1541
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:42,420
I never do that.

1542
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:43,860
Well, then you can number it.

1543
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:44,280
I give up.

1544
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:44,660
I'm done.

1545
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:45,480
Then you do mine.

1546
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:53,420
No, I listened to almost the whole video of people calling in about how many partners they've been with.

1547
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:54,440
Oh, yeah, that one.

1548
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:55,640
I remember that one.

1549
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:00,060
Yeah, that's my crowning achievement in my afterlife.

1550
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:04,100
So you watch Lasagna Cat, but not, like, actually things from Jim Davis?

1551
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:06,200
No, why would I...

1552
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:07,600
No.

1553
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:09,100
I don't think so, no.

1554
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:14,920
But Lasagna Cat is basically reenacting... Yeah, Lasagna Cat is reenacting the strips.

1555
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:16,760
Yeah, but it's not from the creator.

1556
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:18,440
That's fine.

1557
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:19,440
It's not from the creator.

1558
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:20,020
That's fine.

1559
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:20,520
It's a parody.

1560
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,320
Yeah, why would anyone do that?

1561
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:29,580
Yeah, see, see, see.

1562
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:30,980
You know what's funny?

1563
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:37,480
Like, Jim Davis literally was like, I created Garfield so I can make a lot of money.

1564
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,000
Well,

1565
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:49,020
I don't think Garfield is notorious for having an ass.

1566
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:50,120
You don't know that.

1567
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:51,120
You've never seen that before.

1568
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:51,720
Is he?

1569
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:52,840
Never seen it.

1570
01:27:55,720 --> 01:28:00,320
Yeah, Snake actually has cake.

1571
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:06,730
Alright, let me see.

1572
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:09,090
Gar... Oh no, I shouldn't Google that.

1573
01:28:09,510 --> 01:28:10,250
You're looking up Gar...

1574
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:11,530
I know, I know, I shouldn't Google that.

1575
01:28:11,530 --> 01:28:11,630
Garfield ass.

1576
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:12,350
No, I'm not.

1577
01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:13,410
I'm not looking up Garfield.

1578
01:28:13,410 --> 01:28:15,170
I'm getting, I'm getting deja vu.

1579
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:17,830
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not looking it up.

1580
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:18,330
I'm getting...

1581
01:28:18,330 --> 01:28:21,490
I'm not, I realize that that was a mistake.

1582
01:28:21,490 --> 01:28:22,990
I'm getting deja vu all of a sudden.

1583
01:28:23,010 --> 01:28:28,330
I realize looking up Garfield ass is not, is not appropriate.

1584
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:33,750
Look up naked Garfield and you'll get it.

1585
01:28:33,790 --> 01:28:35,850
Probably with his name Andrew Garfield.

1586
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:38,450
Oh my god.

1587
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:43,550
Guys, I realize that it could be a mistake if I try to look that up.

1588
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:45,310
Deja vu real.

1589
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:48,430
61 everybody.

1590
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:50,250
I have more.

1591
01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:56,720
I don't know why my silver keeps running out.

1592
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,080
I think it's the postcard paper.

1593
01:28:58,640 --> 01:28:59,440
I think so too.

1594
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:03,160
I mean my, my, my marker for this is still working.

1595
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:06,080
But look, look how the silver is reacting.

1596
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:08,140
Maybe it's just the silver.

1597
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:09,260
Maybe it's just me.

1598
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:10,200
Maybe it's just you.

1599
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:13,180
I'm too hot to handle and it's drying it out.

1600
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:15,860
H -O -T-T-O-G-O.

1601
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:19,380
You can't hang me hot to go.

1602
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:21,960
That's not on the set list by the way.

1603
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:23,920
I hope she means hot to go.

1604
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:24,220
Yeah.

1605
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:29,660
We were like, oh my god, wouldn't it be funny if like we started a concert.

1606
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:30,420
See, look at this.

1607
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,360
Oh yeah.

1608
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:35,500
We started a concert and we're like, hey guys, let's welcome Sabrina Carpenter.

1609
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,540
We start the concert off like that.

1610
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,420
Oh, that's meat espresso.

1611
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,260
Oh my god, and then look at this one.

1612
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:46,200
It's so milky.

1613
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:46,920
Look.

1614
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:47,840
Oh yeah.

1615
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:48,920
There's no in between.

1616
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:50,100
There's no in between.

1617
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,340
Maybe just let it know like.

1618
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,760
I'm actually suffering here guys.

1619
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:55,400
Yeah, interchange it so then like the ink drops down.

1620
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:55,680
Yeah, yeah.

1621
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:56,440
Cause you're letting it dry.

1622
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:58,780
You're doing it so fast that the ink can't catch up.

1623
01:29:59,020 --> 01:29:59,300
Maybe.

1624
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:00,840
I think that's basically it.

1625
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,620
I think the ink's not catching up to the rest of the postcards.

1626
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:05,620
Yoki, there's a fan art of Femmedy now.

1627
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:07,820
Alright, look it up.

1628
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:08,920
You do it.

1629
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:09,260
No.

1630
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:10,560
I'm signing.

1631
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:11,740
Do you want me to sign or not?

1632
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:14,860
Okay, I'll look it up.

1633
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:28,670
I like the SNL parody of that.

1634
01:30:28,770 --> 01:30:29,620
Here we go.

1635
01:30:30,990 --> 01:30:32,090
What the fuck is that?

1636
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:32,910
It's Merian.

1637
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:35,250
I don't know what their character is like.

1638
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:35,810
It's a bird.

1639
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:36,750
Oh, a bird.

1640
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:38,930
It's literally a dragoon.

1641
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:39,750
How the fuck?

1642
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:41,610
You're supposed to be a dragoon.

1643
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:45,410
Why are you...

1644
01:30:45,410 --> 01:30:46,310
Oh my god.

1645
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:47,750
We're wiping each other's noses.

1646
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:51,550
Why are you a person?

1647
01:30:52,730 --> 01:30:53,990
What do you mean I'm a...

1648
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:55,070
No, I meant Femmedy.

1649
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:57,030
Why are you a person?

1650
01:30:57,130 --> 01:30:58,830
You're supposed to be a dragoon.

1651
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:11,930
I'm tired now.

1652
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:12,790
You're not.

1653
01:31:13,490 --> 01:31:14,930
You're only at 60.

1654
01:31:16,490 --> 01:31:18,250
You can finish the rest.

1655
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:19,290
No, I...

1656
01:31:19,810 --> 01:31:21,950
I can't finish my other ones.

1657
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:23,670
I still have this left.

1658
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:25,150
I haven't signed yet.

1659
01:31:28,690 --> 01:31:30,430
Guys, she's not working anymore.

1660
01:31:30,430 --> 01:31:31,710
She doesn't care.

1661
01:31:31,810 --> 01:31:33,170
I'm doomscrolling through Twitter.

1662
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:34,130
She doesn't care.

1663
01:31:34,410 --> 01:31:36,150
I care, cause I'm still...

1664
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:37,990
If you cared, you'd be done by now.

1665
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:39,830
No, I'm just slow.

1666
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:40,610
Because...

1667
01:31:40,610 --> 01:31:41,230
Okay, okay.

1668
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:41,890
No, no, no.

1669
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:43,110
No, no, no.

1670
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:48,290
I care more because I put more love into each of my autographs.

1671
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:49,810
You're just like a machine.

1672
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:52,490
You're like a manufacturing machine.

1673
01:31:53,030 --> 01:31:54,430
This is like talking to a child.

1674
01:31:57,210 --> 01:32:03,130
It's like a kindergarten teacher trying to fucking rationalize for this stupid child.

1675
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:09,770
That their parents dropped one hour early because they didn't want to deal with her anymore.

1676
01:32:10,450 --> 01:32:12,250
This is your bullet.

1677
01:32:12,990 --> 01:32:13,730
This is your bullet.

1678
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:14,930
This is a song.

1679
01:32:16,910 --> 01:32:18,110
It's stupid.

1680
01:32:18,730 --> 01:32:19,470
I think it is.

1681
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:20,090
Brain fluid.

1682
01:32:20,090 --> 01:32:20,770
I think...

1683
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:26,290
I think mine is just...

1684
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:30,930
Mine is just like a medical issue, but it's definitely not brain fluid.

1685
01:32:31,430 --> 01:32:33,290
Hers actually is.

1686
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:42,370
I'm letting it dry, by the way, because I'm letting the ink roll down, like you said.

1687
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:44,270
Sure.

1688
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:49,430
Zero, six, eight.

1689
01:32:49,670 --> 01:32:50,450
Some of them are...

1690
01:32:50,450 --> 01:32:51,690
Look, it's too wet.

1691
01:32:51,930 --> 01:32:52,630
It's too wet.

1692
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:54,210
Then you let it dry too often.

1693
01:32:54,330 --> 01:32:55,890
Maybe you shouldn't wait it too long.

1694
01:32:56,090 --> 01:32:57,430
No, what are you talking about?

1695
01:32:57,550 --> 01:32:58,550
That doesn't make any sense.

1696
01:32:58,570 --> 01:33:00,270
I'm gonna go blow my nose.

1697
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:01,590
Again, again.

1698
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:02,290
Again, again.

1699
01:33:02,330 --> 01:33:04,730
You guys, are you ready for the funny number?

1700
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:11,470
Zero, six, nine.

1701
01:33:14,550 --> 01:33:16,570
Oh, you should do something special on that one.

1702
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:17,330
What?

1703
01:33:17,410 --> 01:33:18,210
Add a smiling face.

1704
01:33:18,890 --> 01:33:19,210
Okay.

1705
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:21,550
I added a smiling face.

1706
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:24,470
You should write one of them and be like, help me.

1707
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:26,310
We already did that, didn't we?

1708
01:33:26,330 --> 01:33:27,950
No, we didn't do it.

1709
01:33:29,310 --> 01:33:31,210
Oh no, you did the sad face.

1710
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:35,330
You should make one of them and write, help me.

1711
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:39,650
And then somebody who has never watched the stream of the signing is gonna get that.

1712
01:33:39,770 --> 01:33:41,470
It's still too dry.

1713
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:43,530
This sucks, man.

1714
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:45,950
I can't work under these conditions.

1715
01:33:46,450 --> 01:33:47,890
I'm only on 70.

1716
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:49,170
You see, I don't complain.

1717
01:33:49,370 --> 01:33:50,970
Okay, here, you can sign with this then.

1718
01:33:51,870 --> 01:33:52,670
Sign with that pen.

1719
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:54,950
I can't because I have to do the regular stuff.

1720
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:56,530
Okay, well then you can do the rest.

1721
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:58,870
I'm gonna get to 100 and you do the rest of the numbers.

1722
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:00,950
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1723
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:01,790
That's a good idea.

1724
01:34:02,110 --> 01:34:03,450
That's not fair.

1725
01:34:05,130 --> 01:34:06,410
That's not fair.

1726
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:07,150
Why are you laughing?

1727
01:34:07,290 --> 01:34:09,190
My signature is harder.

1728
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:10,870
Where was that number?

1729
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:13,290
I literally...

1730
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:16,850
That's not fair.

1731
01:34:16,990 --> 01:34:17,990
My signature is harder.

1732
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:21,210
The way you screamed it like a literal child.

1733
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:22,510
Who's the child now?

1734
01:34:22,510 --> 01:34:24,670
Oh, yeah, it's if I just did like...

1735
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:26,610
That's not fair.

1736
01:34:26,910 --> 01:34:28,790
I don't wanna do half the work.

1737
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:31,150
Oh, yeah, half the work.

1738
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:32,250
You're still...

1739
01:34:32,870 --> 01:34:35,390
Yeah, half the work is writing half the numbers.

1740
01:34:35,710 --> 01:34:37,910
Yeah, your signature is literally shorter than mine.

1741
01:34:38,070 --> 01:34:39,470
That's not my fault.

1742
01:34:42,030 --> 01:34:46,390
It's not shorter because we literally both have the same number of letters in our names.

1743
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:47,950
No, no, no, no, no.

1744
01:34:47,970 --> 01:34:48,990
Oh, you're writing the bird.

1745
01:34:49,410 --> 01:34:50,790
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1746
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:53,830
Because I put more love into my signatures.

1747
01:34:57,690 --> 01:34:59,310
It's just your name is longer.

1748
01:34:59,710 --> 01:35:00,730
That's not my fault.

1749
01:35:00,930 --> 01:35:02,890
You should have renamed yourself something better.

1750
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:04,990
Somebody can't fucking count, apparently.

1751
01:35:05,130 --> 01:35:07,070
You're like, oh, your name is like the same length as mine.

1752
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:08,290
I thought you were writing just doki.

1753
01:35:08,290 --> 01:35:10,930
No, because there's so many doki's in the fucking world.

1754
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:12,590
Okay, well, I don't know.

1755
01:35:13,110 --> 01:35:15,370
I think someone would look at this and know that it's you.

1756
01:35:16,130 --> 01:35:17,950
I can't use this pen anymore.

1757
01:35:18,610 --> 01:35:19,710
Actually, I'm gonna lose my...

1758
01:35:19,710 --> 01:35:24,050
This was such a bad idea, numbering these, because the pens don't work.

1759
01:35:24,730 --> 01:35:25,690
This was your idea.

1760
01:35:25,690 --> 01:35:27,390
I'm actually getting so frustrated.

1761
01:35:27,390 --> 01:35:29,590
This was your idea regarding numbering.

1762
01:35:29,710 --> 01:35:33,030
Because I was like, just do one, two, three, four, five, six.

1763
01:35:33,090 --> 01:35:34,250
You're like, no, I'm gonna put zero.

1764
01:35:34,590 --> 01:35:35,690
That's not the problem.

1765
01:35:35,690 --> 01:35:38,590
I'm actually getting so annoyed by this, actually.

1766
01:35:41,790 --> 01:35:43,410
What the fuck?

1767
01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:47,510
She like threw her Sharpie at the wall.

1768
01:35:47,710 --> 01:35:48,030
Yeah.

1769
01:35:48,190 --> 01:35:50,450
She's having a temper tantrum right now, guys.

1770
01:35:50,490 --> 01:35:50,990
I'm actually really...

1771
01:35:50,990 --> 01:35:52,550
Count to ten and then you'll feel better.

1772
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:53,930
I'm actually annoyed.

1773
01:35:54,430 --> 01:35:54,890
You should count to ten.

1774
01:35:54,910 --> 01:35:56,230
Don't talk to me, I'm angry.

1775
01:35:56,850 --> 01:35:58,570
Count to ten and then you'll feel better.

1776
01:35:58,870 --> 01:35:58,970
No.

1777
01:35:59,830 --> 01:36:01,410
I learned that in kindergarten.

1778
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:04,550
It's gonna work on you.

1779
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:07,670
But they look so ugly because they don't look good.

1780
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:08,870
What do you mean?

1781
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:09,830
They're drying.

1782
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:10,750
No, it's not.

1783
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:11,690
They're fine.

1784
01:36:13,070 --> 01:36:13,470
Look.

1785
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:14,970
Use the other one.

1786
01:36:15,070 --> 01:36:15,830
It's too wet.

1787
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:18,290
Shouldn't we have three silver?

1788
01:36:18,290 --> 01:36:19,370
We only have three.

1789
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:20,190
Look at this.

1790
01:36:20,710 --> 01:36:21,630
Oh, wait, that's not the right one.

1791
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:21,930
Hold on.

1792
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:23,350
Wait, why don't you use this one?

1793
01:36:23,430 --> 01:36:24,210
Because it dries out.

1794
01:36:24,270 --> 01:36:25,490
It becomes the same like that.

1795
01:36:26,450 --> 01:36:27,170
Look, it's fine.

1796
01:36:28,170 --> 01:36:29,090
Guys, it's fine.

1797
01:36:30,130 --> 01:36:31,710
Just put it on this and let it dry.

1798
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:33,450
Oh, my God.

1799
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:38,570
Look, I sacrificed precious signing time to deal with a child.

1800
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:40,430
I'm so annoyed.

1801
01:36:44,990 --> 01:36:46,290
I'm gonna end the stream.

1802
01:36:47,350 --> 01:36:47,970
You're just...

1803
01:36:48,450 --> 01:36:49,650
She's just acting, guys.

1804
01:36:52,990 --> 01:36:54,870
She's just acting, guys.

1805
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:55,910
She's not gonna end.

1806
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:56,250
It's so ugly.

1807
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:58,730
It's hard because I have to wait for it to dry.

1808
01:36:59,130 --> 01:37:00,110
So it's taking longer.

1809
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:01,490
Oh, no.

1810
01:37:01,670 --> 01:37:02,770
It's taking longer.

1811
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:04,390
Oh, no.

1812
01:37:05,770 --> 01:37:06,450
Oh, no.

1813
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:08,730
It's taking longer.

1814
01:37:09,270 --> 01:37:10,670
Oh, no.

1815
01:37:20,350 --> 01:37:21,730
Who ordered the VIP packages?

1816
01:37:22,430 --> 01:37:23,390
Anybody in chat?

1817
01:37:24,190 --> 01:37:25,130
Are you guys excited?

1818
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:29,230
Getting the ones where Mint doesn't cry about it.

1819
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:33,650
I got it.

1820
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:34,830
Good for you.

1821
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:35,990
You might get one that has...

1822
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:37,430
Look, it's literally gooping there.

1823
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:39,430
It's gonna drip onto it.

1824
01:37:39,450 --> 01:37:40,810
It makes it extra special.

1825
01:37:41,630 --> 01:37:43,370
Guys, who wants a gooping one?

1826
01:37:43,570 --> 01:37:46,550
Does anyone want the goopy marker?

1827
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:49,350
See, they want it.

1828
01:37:49,410 --> 01:37:50,630
They want the goopy one.

1829
01:37:50,770 --> 01:37:53,350
It's actually dripping out, you guys.

1830
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:57,660
They're into it.

1831
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:01,190
I didn't know that.

1832
01:38:01,190 --> 01:38:01,930
Why do we...

1833
01:38:01,930 --> 01:38:03,230
Oh, shit, I messed up again.

1834
01:38:03,370 --> 01:38:06,090
Why do we have three silvers and none of them work?

1835
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:14,110
She's angry.

1836
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:15,650
I'm actually angry.

1837
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:17,190
I'm actually so annoyed.

1838
01:38:18,210 --> 01:38:19,150
Because she's angry.

1839
01:38:21,290 --> 01:38:22,130
Because she's angry.

1840
01:38:22,370 --> 01:38:22,950
What do I do?

1841
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:24,430
I think she might hit me.

1842
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:26,870
You're the one who actually hit me.

1843
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:32,290
I don't want her to regret it.

1844
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:36,550
Okay, I'll give you one hit.

1845
01:38:36,830 --> 01:38:37,950
It'll make you feel better.

1846
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:38,890
Hint about what?

1847
01:38:39,070 --> 01:38:39,730
I'll give you one hit.

1848
01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:40,750
Oh, hits.

1849
01:38:40,850 --> 01:38:41,670
No, I don't want a hit.

1850
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:42,450
I don't want a hit.

1851
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:43,010
I don't want a hit.

1852
01:38:46,930 --> 01:38:47,950
It'll make you feel better.

1853
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:49,410
It'll help your aggression.

1854
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:51,750
Maybe if I hit you.

1855
01:38:52,270 --> 01:38:53,430
I said I'd let you hit me once.

1856
01:38:53,530 --> 01:38:54,950
Oh, I thought you meant you were gonna hit me.

1857
01:38:54,950 --> 01:38:56,610
No, I said I'd let you hit me once.

1858
01:38:56,770 --> 01:38:57,070
No.

1859
01:38:57,770 --> 01:38:58,090
Okay.

1860
01:38:59,050 --> 01:39:01,910
And I'll never let that opportunity come to her again.

1861
01:39:02,830 --> 01:39:05,810
I'm just having to switch between three pens and they all shit.

1862
01:39:06,430 --> 01:39:07,710
They're all fucking shit.

1863
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:11,310
I'm having a good time, guys.

1864
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:13,650
I'm actually having a good time.

1865
01:39:14,630 --> 01:39:16,430
I'm actually gonna stop at 100, okay?

1866
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:17,350
So you do the rest.

1867
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:17,950
No.

1868
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:21,690
Yes, because I actually am gonna lose my mind if I continue with these.

1869
01:39:21,690 --> 01:39:22,450
But it's content.

1870
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:23,470
They like that.

1871
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:24,350
No, I'm actually...

1872
01:39:24,350 --> 01:39:25,450
They like that.

1873
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:27,230
They want you to lose your mind.

1874
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:27,570
No.

1875
01:39:27,850 --> 01:39:29,470
They like it when you get a little delulu.

1876
01:39:29,950 --> 01:39:30,330
No.

1877
01:39:31,290 --> 01:39:32,270
Not like this.

1878
01:39:33,630 --> 01:39:35,030
Don't make me do more work.

1879
01:39:35,090 --> 01:39:35,550
I'll cry.

1880
01:39:39,690 --> 01:39:40,610
And 100.

1881
01:39:41,090 --> 01:39:41,450
Okay.

1882
01:39:41,570 --> 01:39:43,590
Doki will sign the rest after 100.

1883
01:39:43,970 --> 01:39:44,070
No.

1884
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:46,990
What did you do?

1885
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:48,570
Oh, hey, look at...

1886
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:49,930
Oh, you should fill up the other circle.

1887
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:50,850
Make it extra special.

1888
01:39:50,990 --> 01:39:51,290
Oh, my God.

1889
01:39:51,410 --> 01:39:52,030
But it's dripping.

1890
01:39:52,510 --> 01:39:53,350
Wait, is it actually...

1891
01:39:53,350 --> 01:39:54,530
It's actually dripping, yes.

1892
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:56,430
I think this one is actually, like, faulty.

1893
01:39:56,810 --> 01:39:58,330
Look, it's, like, dripping all over the desk.

1894
01:39:58,390 --> 01:39:59,350
Wait, yeah, I think it's...

1895
01:39:59,350 --> 01:40:00,330
And it's dripping on the postcards.

1896
01:40:00,650 --> 01:40:01,150
Wait, what?

1897
01:40:01,390 --> 01:40:01,750
Yes.

1898
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:06,230
Wait, I think you gotta stop using that one.

1899
01:40:06,290 --> 01:40:07,690
But that's the only one that works.

1900
01:40:09,730 --> 01:40:10,450
Bless you.

1901
01:40:10,590 --> 01:40:11,050
Thank you.

1902
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,170
We should've asked for more markers.

1903
01:40:12,430 --> 01:40:13,190
Oh, my God.

1904
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:14,990
That's why it's dripping on me.

1905
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:17,530
Oh, it's dripping on my pants.

1906
01:40:17,630 --> 01:40:17,810
No.

1907
01:40:18,350 --> 01:40:19,810
My cinnamon roll pants.

1908
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:22,830
That's bad.

1909
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:23,490
I know.

1910
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:24,890
Maybe they'll...

1911
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:27,010
Maybe they'll pay for your pants.

1912
01:40:27,290 --> 01:40:28,910
These were a gift from my mom.

1913
01:40:29,170 --> 01:40:30,270
Oh, no.

1914
01:40:30,610 --> 01:40:31,490
Can you wash it?

1915
01:40:31,910 --> 01:40:32,670
It's Sharpie.

1916
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:34,290
I'm pretty sure you can wash Sharpie.

1917
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:37,050
There's, like, a solution for that, right?

1918
01:40:39,390 --> 01:40:40,450
I'm pretty sure.

1919
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:44,550
Guys, how do you wash Sharpie, guys?

1920
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:45,430
We need help.

1921
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:51,540
Get soap.

1922
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:52,100
Get soap.

1923
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:53,020
Get soap.

1924
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:54,060
Wait.

1925
01:40:54,260 --> 01:40:54,940
Alcohol wipes.

1926
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:55,820
Alcohol wipes help.

1927
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:56,300
Oh, yeah.

1928
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:56,960
Alcohol wipes.

1929
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,240
Oh, I think I have one, actually.

1930
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:00,580
Yeah, that should work.

1931
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:03,620
Because, like, Sharpie is removable by alcohol wipes.

1932
01:41:04,340 --> 01:41:05,460
Or rubbing alcohol.

1933
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:05,800
Yeah.

1934
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:09,040
That's usually it.

1935
01:41:12,430 --> 01:41:13,250
This is it.

1936
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:13,950
Make it count.

1937
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:21,840
Guys, does hand sanitizer work?

1938
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:24,020
Chat fixes pants.

1939
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:27,060
Don't use wipes.

1940
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:27,740
No wipes.

1941
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:28,860
Dab it.

1942
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:31,240
Yes, yes, yes.

1943
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:32,880
They said hand sanitizer should work.

1944
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:33,740
Yeah.

1945
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:34,880
Dab.

1946
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:35,540
Don't rub.

1947
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:36,140
Dab.

1948
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:36,520
Don't rub.

1949
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:38,680
You know how to dab?

1950
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:39,160
Show me.

1951
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:42,960
She dabbed in front of me, guys.

1952
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:46,720
Did it work?

1953
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:49,860
I think it... oh, wait.

1954
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,560
Wait a minute.

1955
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,500
This is... it's all over the desk.

1956
01:41:56,540 --> 01:42:00,100
How do you... you need to get, like, a tissue and then start dabbing it.

1957
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:01,680
Yeah, I thought that one wasn't used.

1958
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:07,170
She's getting tissue right now, guys.

1959
01:42:08,150 --> 01:42:09,970
God, now it does look like a dick.

1960
01:42:10,670 --> 01:42:11,750
Guys, I'm sorry.

1961
01:42:11,850 --> 01:42:15,230
My signature with my bullet doesn't look like a...

1962
01:42:15,230 --> 01:42:16,210
I'm sorry.

1963
01:42:18,350 --> 01:42:18,870
No.

1964
01:42:21,690 --> 01:42:25,510
No, the bullet doesn't look like a bullet.

1965
01:42:27,430 --> 01:42:29,090
I'm sorry to whoever gets this one.

1966
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:30,550
I'm sorry.

1967
01:42:30,690 --> 01:42:33,870
I didn't mean to draw an actual... an actual pee-pee.

1968
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:36,470
I didn't mean to, guys.

1969
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:36,970
I swear.

1970
01:42:37,810 --> 01:42:39,870
It's just... it's just how the world works.

1971
01:42:40,170 --> 01:42:42,210
These are cursed postcards.

1972
01:42:43,170 --> 01:42:44,470
It's made with love.

1973
01:42:44,510 --> 01:42:46,470
Maybe we only label one to a hundred.

1974
01:42:47,130 --> 01:42:47,550
I don't know.

1975
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:49,170
Stop giving...

1976
01:42:49,170 --> 01:42:51,590
We gotta be consistent.

1977
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:53,530
No, you do the rest.

1978
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:58,110
And don't use this one because it'll explode on you.

1979
01:42:58,810 --> 01:43:00,430
But I have to do my own.

1980
01:43:00,730 --> 01:43:02,530
Yeah, you'll just have to use the dry ones.

1981
01:43:02,630 --> 01:43:03,050
I'm sorry.

1982
01:43:03,150 --> 01:43:04,730
But I have to do my own.

1983
01:43:04,990 --> 01:43:06,230
Why can't you do this?

1984
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:09,490
Because the pens don't work and I'm gonna have a fucking aneurysm.

1985
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:11,870
You need a brain for that.

1986
01:43:12,790 --> 01:43:15,530
Yeah, it's leaking out my nose because of this.

1987
01:43:15,530 --> 01:43:17,430
It's not coming out.

1988
01:43:17,550 --> 01:43:18,510
Oh, no.

1989
01:43:18,990 --> 01:43:20,370
Wait, it is sort of.

1990
01:43:20,490 --> 01:43:21,210
It's not.

1991
01:43:22,170 --> 01:43:24,410
That's just how it was in the middle already.

1992
01:43:25,370 --> 01:43:26,490
Because it's metallic.

1993
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:30,530
I think you gotta get, like, alcohol then...

1994
01:43:31,630 --> 01:43:33,190
Maybe... did you do the other side?

1995
01:43:35,070 --> 01:43:36,390
It's on this side, though.

1996
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:39,030
Yeah, but then it leaked onto the other side, though, didn't it?

1997
01:43:39,810 --> 01:43:42,170
Yeah, so maybe do the other side, too.

1998
01:43:42,310 --> 01:43:44,770
But it's wet on the... it's going through.

1999
01:43:47,190 --> 01:43:48,390
Oh, man.

2000
01:43:48,750 --> 01:43:50,630
There might not be enough alcohol in it.

2001
01:43:50,730 --> 01:43:51,070
Maybe.

2002
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:51,710
Yeah.

2003
01:43:53,010 --> 01:43:54,330
Soak it in sanitizer.

2004
01:43:54,710 --> 01:43:57,230
The... will probably come out after washing.

2005
01:43:57,770 --> 01:44:00,390
Oh, it says soak it in sanitizer or...

2006
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:01,190
I can't soak it.

2007
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:02,050
It's my pants.

2008
01:44:03,790 --> 01:44:05,410
When you... when you get home.

2009
01:44:05,830 --> 01:44:06,530
Oh, maybe.

2010
01:44:06,730 --> 01:44:11,150
Yeah, I mean, it should... it wouldn't matter if it dries up anyway if you're gonna soak it after.

2011
01:44:11,530 --> 01:44:13,410
I think you have to soak it immediately, right?

2012
01:44:13,410 --> 01:44:15,730
You have to soak it immediately, guys?

2013
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:18,890
Do you guys have to soak it immediately?

2014
01:44:19,110 --> 01:44:19,950
We gotta know.

2015
01:44:20,130 --> 01:44:21,110
Yeah, we have to know.

2016
01:44:23,250 --> 01:44:25,530
Uh... oh, soak immediately.

2017
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:26,270
Yeah.

2018
01:44:26,890 --> 01:44:27,430
Yeah.

2019
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:29,150
Apparently.

2020
01:44:33,330 --> 01:44:35,850
Maybe ask your mom to buy you another one.

2021
01:44:39,230 --> 01:44:40,590
When she comes back.

2022
01:44:40,930 --> 01:44:41,910
She lives there.

2023
01:44:42,270 --> 01:44:44,010
Oh, wait, she lives there?

2024
01:44:44,430 --> 01:44:44,670
Yeah.

2025
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:45,270
Oh.

2026
01:44:46,530 --> 01:44:47,450
That's cool.

2027
01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:54,490
Does she always live there?

2028
01:44:54,910 --> 01:44:55,210
Mm-hmm.

2029
01:44:55,690 --> 01:44:56,170
Oh.

2030
01:44:56,730 --> 01:44:57,670
I'm depressed.

2031
01:44:57,670 --> 01:44:58,610
Oh, wait, wait, really?

2032
01:44:58,990 --> 01:45:00,490
She always lived in...

2033
01:45:01,470 --> 01:45:02,970
She always lived in Japan?

2034
01:45:03,550 --> 01:45:03,910
Yeah.

2035
01:45:04,270 --> 01:45:06,270
Oh, my God, no wonder you're like this.

2036
01:45:09,030 --> 01:45:10,370
She's on her bed now.

2037
01:45:10,530 --> 01:45:11,730
She's... she's sad.

2038
01:45:12,450 --> 01:45:15,290
Guys, say some words to cheer her up.

2039
01:45:15,850 --> 01:45:18,450
She's... she can't read it because she's not at the chat.

2040
01:45:18,450 --> 01:45:19,770
I have to read them out.

2041
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:22,670
I am signing the postcards.

2042
01:45:23,590 --> 01:45:25,230
Do you want me to sign?

2043
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:30,330
Now I have to do the metallic ones too.

2044
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:31,590
The numbers too.

2045
01:45:32,750 --> 01:45:34,230
Yeah, I have to also.

2046
01:45:36,340 --> 01:45:38,820
Oh, my God, don't do this to me.

2047
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:41,660
Don't do this to me.

2048
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:48,600
Someone says, You can do it.

2049
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:55,440
And that's the two I'll read because I have to work now.

2050
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:11,850
I'm almost done with my autographs.

2051
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:19,440
Guys, she's depressed.

2052
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:21,660
She's very sad right now.

2053
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:24,720
She's on her bed watching TikToks.

2054
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:27,300
I'm not... you know I'm not watching TikToks.

2055
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:29,860
She's literally... she's...

2056
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:36,660
She's watching TikToks instead of, you know, helping out, you know?

2057
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:38,360
I did my job!

2058
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:41,000
I'm not good enough, really.

2059
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:46,200
All right, fine!

2060
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:48,020
Fine, entertain chat!

2061
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:49,620
Do it!

2062
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:50,300
Go!

2063
01:46:50,980 --> 01:46:52,020
Oh, wait, I should go.

2064
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:52,480
Yes!

2065
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:53,900
I'm going!

2066
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:54,720
Okay!

2067
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:56,600
We're ending stream!

2068
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:58,020
End our friendship!

2069
01:46:58,680 --> 01:46:59,780
Oh, wait, let me finish this first.

2070
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:01,100
Oh, my God.

2071
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:01,940
Are you actually done?

2072
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:02,940
No, I'm not.

2073
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,100
Of course I'm not!

2074
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:05,660
Well, take them back to your room.

2075
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:06,940
Oh, my God, what?

2076
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:08,460
Yeah, because you have to finish!

2077
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:10,380
Can you please do it?

2078
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:11,500
No!

2079
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:14,820
That's not even going to be all of them.

2080
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:16,380
You just have to sign 100 of them.

2081
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:18,800
To 200.

2082
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:20,780
Guys, she kicked me out, guys.

2083
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:22,100
Yeah, good night, everybody.

2084
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:23,260
Guys, she kicked me out.

2085
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:24,020
Good night, everybody.

2086
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:25,940
Guys, she kicked me out, everybody.

2087
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:26,440
Good night, everybody.

2088
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:27,520
Have a good night!

2089
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:29,440
Yay to Christmas!

2090
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:34,620
Guys, it's not you!

2091
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:39,320
The reason why I'm leaving is not because of you guys.

2092
01:47:39,740 --> 01:47:42,360
Well, I mean, it kind of is because we're signing these for them.

2093
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:45,280
Guys, I would never blame you guys.

2094
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:50,220
We're going to take all your Sharpies and all your pens and everything.

2095
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:53,460
Sometimes you might see me in the weekends.

2096
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:04,240
But it's not... what happened to us is not because of you guys, though.

2097
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:07,780
Okay, everybody.

2098
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:08,680
Two birthdays!

2099
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:13,120
Thanks for hanging out with us.

2100
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:15,140
I'm getting hang... not hangry.

2101
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,240
I'm getting sleepy-angy.

2102
01:48:17,540 --> 01:48:18,700
I'm sleepy-angy.

2103
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:19,520
Okay!

2104
01:48:20,180 --> 01:48:21,320
Alright, well, bye, guys!

2105
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:22,440
Bye!

2106
01:48:24,290 --> 01:48:24,950
Bye!

2107
01:48:25,030 --> 01:48:26,730
We're going to finish this up.

2108
01:48:27,770 --> 01:48:28,090
Bye!

2109
01:48:28,090 --> 01:48:29,130
See you guys later!

2110
01:48:29,210 --> 01:48:29,530
Bye!

2111
01:48:29,770 --> 01:48:31,250
Oh, you want the bag?

2112
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:35,190
Wait, here, so put them in the bag and take the tote.

2113
01:48:35,710 --> 01:48:37,430
Okay, wait, can you...

2114
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:37,870
Okay.

2115
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:38,550
Okay.

2116
01:48:39,310 --> 01:48:40,490
Wait, can they still hear us?

2117
01:48:40,570 --> 01:48:40,790
Yeah.

2118
01:48:40,970 --> 01:48:41,850
Okay, good, okay.

2119
01:48:42,550 --> 01:48:43,590
See, we're working together!

2120
01:48:45,290 --> 01:48:48,690
No, because this is not... this is numbered, and this is not...

2121
01:48:48,690 --> 01:48:49,570
These aren't numbered?

2122
01:48:49,790 --> 01:48:50,270
These aren't numbered.

2123
01:48:50,350 --> 01:48:51,550
These aren't numbered, so I have to number these.

2124
01:48:51,650 --> 01:48:53,590
And then these are the ones that I have to finish signing.

2125
01:48:53,590 --> 01:48:54,690
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2126
01:48:56,050 --> 01:48:57,690
Um... how do we separate this?

2127
01:48:57,970 --> 01:48:58,370
I don't know.

2128
01:48:58,450 --> 01:48:59,470
Here, I'll just take them back...

2129
01:48:59,470 --> 01:49:00,510
There's bags here.

2130
01:49:00,730 --> 01:49:01,030
Yeah.

2131
01:49:01,170 --> 01:49:01,910
So you put...

2132
01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:03,550
I'll put the numbered one in the bag.

2133
01:49:03,790 --> 01:49:04,090
Yeah.

2134
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:05,890
Put the numbered one in the bag.

2135
01:49:05,990 --> 01:49:07,750
You can keep these, because, like...

2136
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:11,110
No, I'm not... we should give them...

2137
01:49:11,110 --> 01:49:12,590
You see them first.

2138
01:49:14,710 --> 01:49:15,650
I'll just give this to you.

2139
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:18,670
I'll just go to your room and give this to you after I'm done.

2140
01:49:18,870 --> 01:49:19,610
And then you can give this...

2141
01:49:19,610 --> 01:49:20,290
I'm going to be asleep!

2142
01:49:20,950 --> 01:49:22,350
And I'm going to leave before you.

2143
01:49:22,750 --> 01:49:23,590
You're going to be asleep?

2144
01:49:23,590 --> 01:49:24,670
Yeah, but you'll see them first.

2145
01:49:24,750 --> 01:49:25,970
You give them this first.

2146
01:49:26,110 --> 01:49:27,470
Yeah, but when are you going to give these to me?

2147
01:49:27,650 --> 01:49:31,470
When I... no, as in, I'll give these to them when I see them.

2148
01:49:31,870 --> 01:49:33,410
No, I think we should just do it all together.

2149
01:49:35,070 --> 01:49:37,750
Okay, you won't be asleep instantly when I'm done.

2150
01:49:38,370 --> 01:49:39,250
Are you going to go to bed instantly?

2151
01:49:39,250 --> 01:49:40,450
How long are you going to be?

2152
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:41,830
Wait, what time is it?

2153
01:49:42,090 --> 01:49:43,090
Oh, yeah, never mind.

2154
01:49:43,170 --> 01:49:43,890
Okay, I'll... yeah, I'll...

2155
01:49:43,890 --> 01:49:44,870
No, no, no, that's wrong.

2156
01:49:44,970 --> 01:49:45,290
My computer...

2157
01:49:45,290 --> 01:49:48,970
No, no, no, I know, but I can... I can do math for now.

2158
01:49:49,370 --> 01:49:49,670
I...

2159
01:49:49,670 --> 01:49:50,550
Wait, what time is it?

2160
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:51,370
No, no, I'll give...

2161
01:49:51,370 --> 01:49:52,870
Yeah, no, I'll give them... I'll give them to...

2162
01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:53,590
I'll give them to...

2163
01:49:53,590 --> 01:49:55,010
It's only the... but it's still...

2164
01:49:55,010 --> 01:49:55,990
Yeah, but you have...

2165
01:49:55,990 --> 01:49:56,610
Yeah, I know.

2166
01:49:56,930 --> 01:49:58,030
No, you're... you have to.

2167
01:49:58,130 --> 01:49:58,350
Okay.

2168
01:49:58,690 --> 01:49:59,110
All right.

2169
01:49:59,430 --> 01:49:59,730
Okay.

2170
01:50:00,170 --> 01:50:01,650
Okay, so we figured it out.

2171
01:50:01,730 --> 01:50:02,010
Yeah.

2172
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:03,250
You know what?

2173
01:50:03,270 --> 01:50:04,270
We should have done that off-screen.

2174
01:50:04,710 --> 01:50:04,750
Okay.

2175
01:50:05,970 --> 01:50:06,370
Bye.

2176
01:50:07,390 --> 01:50:09,490
This brings it to our lives.

2177
01:50:10,230 --> 01:50:10,590
Bye.

2178
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:10,910
Bye.

2179
01:50:11,530 --> 01:50:11,810
Bye.

2180
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:12,470
Bye.

2181
01:50:12,650 --> 01:50:13,050
Bye.

2182
01:50:14,570 --> 01:50:14,970
Bye.
