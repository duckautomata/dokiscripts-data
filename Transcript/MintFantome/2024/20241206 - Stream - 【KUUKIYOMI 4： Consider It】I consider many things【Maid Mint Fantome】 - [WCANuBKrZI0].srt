1
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,260
Sounds like I'm in Pokemon.

2
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,480
Sounds like a Pokemon OST.

3
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,990
Oh my gosh.

4
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,850
Like it's so epic.

5
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,380
Thank you for 7 months.

6
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,560
It's my friend and fellow wisp Melpy's birthday.

7
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,880
You can say happy birthday.

8
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,040
I'm sure she'll pass out when she catches the bod later.

9
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,220
Happy birthday Mel.

10
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,220
You're such a nice friend.

11
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,480
Of course I can say happy birthday.

12
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Happy birthday to you.

13
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,700
Happy birthday to you.

14
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,020
Happy birthday dear Melpy.

15
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,460
Happy birthday to you.

16
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,160
Happy birthday.

17
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,900
I like how you got it in right at the beginning of the stream.

18
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,500
So it's just like...

19
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,140
If she skips the intro...

20
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,500
Well, no.

21
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,320
You start the stream and you're like, yeah.

22
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,660
That's it.

23
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,980
Yo, welcome to membership.

24
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,260
We love when Mint does the Mint thing.

25
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,320
Oh my gosh, another birthday.

26
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,120
I finally got a job and my first day was yesterday.

27
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,540
Daddy!

28
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,680
Oh my gosh!

29
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,660
The music got so epic for you.

30
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,560
One more time!

31
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,880
Happy birthday to you.

32
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,780
Happy birthday to you.

33
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,240
Happy birthday Daddy Inferno.

34
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,760
Happy birthday to you.

35
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,260
Happy birthday.

36
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,740
Welcome everybody to Cookie Yummy 4.

37
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,600
I...

38
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,720
I've only played the first one.

39
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,740
I can't imagine.

40
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,960
It's so much different.

41
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,920
I went to an Indian restaurant once in Japan and they gave me some kind of flatbread.

42
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,600
I asked them, 何ですか?

43
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,600
For some reason they kept saying, はい、そうです。

44
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,600
Like the not...

45
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,290
何ですか?

46
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,910
はい、そうです。

47
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,690
That is good.

48
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,210
That's a silly one.

49
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,610
It's my birthday yesterday.

50
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,650
One more time!

51
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,330
Happy birthday to you.

52
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,670
Happy birthday to you.

53
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,330
Happy birthday dear Zest.

54
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,270
Happy birthday to you.

55
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,290
I went up an octave.

56
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,990
I have been singing for a lot today, you guys.

57
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,650
I had a three hour recording session.

58
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,330
For only one song!

59
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,290
And then the other thing that I was recording took like 30 minutes.

60
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,710
So I'm kind of tired.

61
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,670
My voice is a little tired too.

62
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,650
I don't think I've ever taken so long on just one song before.

63
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,750
But I wanted it to sound good.

64
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,190
I did many takes.

65
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,490
And also part of...

66
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,430
I didn't know it very well.

67
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,270
It's my birthday!

68
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,910
One more time!

69
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,970
Happy birthday to you.

70
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,970
Happy birthday to you.

71
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,290
Happy birthday dear Junii.

72
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,590
Happy birthday to you.

73
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,750
What's going on in March?

74
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,690
Lampy!

75
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,170
Oh, sorry.

76
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,450
Upside down Lampy.

77
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,210
Thanks for the gift.

78
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,310
Mintos spends three hours singing happy birthday.

79
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,130
I guess March is close enough to Valentine's Day, huh?

80
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,110
God, all these dang normies.

81
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,910
Celebrating Valentine's Day.

82
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,210
What's up with this?

83
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,610
Stop it.

84
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,770
Did you hear about the new Gundam series?

85
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,350
I saw.

86
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:32,570
But is this different from the new Gundam that they announced before?

87
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,350
Or is it...

88
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,450
SwizzleStick.

89
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,190
I like your profile picture.

90
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,030
Welcome to Lampy's show.

91
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,430
Damn Riaju.

92
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,650
Damn Riaju.

93
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,470
But no, I actually...

94
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,170
It's funny because the idol I like...

95
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,530
I retweeted about the new Gundam.

96
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,550
She's really into Gundam.

97
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,010
And I...

98
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:05,090
I saw that it was there, but I didn't have time to watch it.

99
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,690
How do you say G...

100
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,130
Gquack?

101
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,150
Is that what it is?

102
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,370
Gquacks?

103
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,170
Miku's fries!

104
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,510
Welcome back for six months.

105
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,950
Thank you.

106
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,250
It's not my birthday, I'm just here to give you...

107
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,070
It will be soon.

108
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,630
Or it was your birthday.

109
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,990
Ashes.

110
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,770
I know.

111
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,530
I know.

112
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,310
It's written by Hide Akiyano.

113
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,350
G...

114
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,010
Gquacks.

115
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,070
Gquacks.

116
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,210
G...

117
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,490
But just look at the katakana, right?

118
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,590
I saw support on this day.

119
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,690
My birthday wish is for you to have all the wisps have a...

120
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,550
For you and all the wisps to have a nice day and night.

121
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,570
Penguin Crossing, happy birthday!

122
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,990
Why is it every time I start singing this song, the music picks up?

123
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,490
Happy birthday...

124
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,770
To you...

125
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,490
Happy birthday...

126
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,630
To you...

127
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,430
Happy birthday, Penguin Crossing!

128
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,730
Happy birthday...

129
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,250
To...

130
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,610
You...

131
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,790
The game is reading the room.

132
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,010
Which we will be doing.

133
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,110
We'll be reading the room.

134
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,670
I'm... I'm doing a yomi.

135
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,030
Wait.

136
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,970
I'm yomi-ing.

137
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,790
And by it, I mean...

138
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,410
The room.

139
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,190
Wait, why didn't I just say it?

140
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,210
I'm reading.

141
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,730
And by it...

142
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,790
Wait, I'm reading it.

143
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,790
And by it, I mean...

144
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,290
The room.

145
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,630
Guys, did you hear?

146
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,590
Did you hear?

147
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,210
Donna Burke.

148
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,450
I meant it's not my birthday.

149
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,090
It's not your birthday, Chaya.

150
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,650
But it was Woshingo's birthday yesterday.

151
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,150
Happy birthday to you.

152
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,210
Happy birthday to you.

153
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,370
Happy birthday, Woshingo.

154
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,730
Happy birthday to you.

155
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,730
How many is that now?

156
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,530
That's not even... We're barely... We're not even 15 minutes in.

157
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,770
We've already done like 5 birthday songs.

158
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,130
5.

159
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,690
Me when I'm reading it.

160
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,990
And by it, I mean the room.

161
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:01,830
The.

162
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,930
Wait, reading room, the.

163
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:04,670
Wait.

164
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,490
Me when I'm read... Wait.

165
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,730
Did you mean the right thing?

166
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:10,750
Considerate.

167
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,590
You guys, have you considered...

168
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,090
Not being so...

169
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:16,970
Stupid.

170
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,690
I'm just kidding.

171
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:23,870
No.

172
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,340
Let's consider something.

173
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,040
Let's consider... You guys... I'm not... Okay.

174
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,840
This is gonna sound kind of pathetic, maybe.

175
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,020
But when I was with... When Matara came...

176
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,660
And I saw her, like, interacting with my mom.

177
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,040
And I was like, I don't even get...

178
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,560
My mom was like telling her stories about my childhood and stuff.

179
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,180
I was like, I don't even talk like this with my mom.

180
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,760
I was like, is there something wrong?

181
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,040
I actually considered maybe that there's something wrong with me.

182
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,540
Because I have such a lack of social skills.

183
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,940
Do you know how many plushies ended up selling?

184
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,280
I don't know, actually.

185
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:10,800
I haven't checked.

186
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,140
But...

187
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,800
Plushies are on sale, baby!

188
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,480
Extroverts be like that?

189
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:19,900
Okay.

190
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,540
And I was like...

191
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,500
I was like, Matara would say something and she would be like, yeah.

192
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,040
You know...

193
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,300
I just... There was one conversation we were having.

194
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,720
She was like, it's obvious how you talk to people.

195
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,080
You just talk to them like this.

196
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,900
And I was like, I've never thought of it like that.

197
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,720
She was like, but why do you always know what to say on stream?

198
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,520
I thought that was calculated.

199
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,180
I was like, what are you talking about?

200
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,380
What am I... I know what to say on stream.

201
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,620
I don't know.

202
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,440
What do you mean?

203
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,780
Sometimes she would just be like...

204
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,440
She would be like, yeah, it's really obvious when you...

205
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,960
Like, just know what to say in these types of situations.

206
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,100
And I'm like, I don't... I've never considered that.

207
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,060
She kind of equated it to being like...

208
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,280
She was like, if you're a waitress, you know...

209
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,800
If you have a group of old ladies come to your restaurant and you're a waitress...

210
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,200
And they ask for wine and you have to be like...

211
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,620
Okay, ladies, let me see some ID.

212
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,860
Even though, you know, I was just like...

213
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,340
That's how you interact with people.

214
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,620
Like, I just...

215
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,220
Pathetic affection.

216
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,680
Happy birthday, Minky.

217
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,060
Thanks!

218
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,780
It's not my birthday.

219
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,480
But yeah, I don't know.

220
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,660
Maybe she can kukiyomi really well.

221
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,780
But me...

222
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,600
We have to learn.

223
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,660
So I hope this will help me become better at the kukiyomi.

224
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,240
It only takes 23 people to have a 50% chance of 2 or more people with the same...

225
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,960
Date of birth.

226
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,400
What?

227
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,460
That's...

228
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,560
That's so little!

229
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,660
The stream is totally not scripted.

230
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,620
What do you mean by that?

231
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,630
Kukiyomi.

232
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,790
Quick...

233
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,030
Considerate.

234
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,230
Quick kukiyomi.

235
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,750
Hey, Minky.

236
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,710
Long time chatter.

237
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,490
First time viewer.

238
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:27,910
Hope you're doing well.

239
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,570
Can you come to my house and check the insides of my walls for water damage?

240
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,530
I already went.

241
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,050
You're fine.

242
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,450
Two people kukiyomi.

243
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,590
Considerate together.

244
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,790
But we don't have two people, so...

245
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:44,750
Otanoshimi corner.

246
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:46,890
Fun minigames.

247
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,750
I hope you find the kukiyomi today.

248
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,190
It's delicious.

249
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,960
Very bad with reading Japan writing.

250
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,260
No, it's okay.

251
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,240
It's...

252
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,380
It...

253
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,740
You know, it's not easy.

254
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,420
It's not easy.

255
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,240
Let's do normal kukiyomi.

256
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:10,980
Bing bong.

257
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,300
This is a space where you are free to consider things as you like.

258
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,800
There is no one here to stop you from being as considerate as you please.

259
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,260
Or as inconsiderate.

260
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,980
Atara is a whole different social level.

261
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,380
It just made me feel like...

262
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,080
I don't know.

263
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,960
Maybe there is something wrong with me.

264
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,560
She can conversate so well, so easily.

265
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,720
I can't do that.

266
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,360
After considering the situation, move the red object on the screen.

267
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,300
Sometimes there may be nothing to move.

268
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,780
Just do what you consider the appropriate action.

269
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,060
If you wish to stop playing, just push the escape key.

270
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,940
Number one.

271
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,560
Mito, it's your birthday!

272
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,060
Happy birthday to you.

273
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,100
Happy birthday to you.

274
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,940
Oh, I thought it was going to rush me.

275
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,780
Happy birthday, dear Relic.

276
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,960
Happy birthday to you.

277
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,260
Me, Pear Pear.

278
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,820
Do I also leave?

279
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,180
I considered it for the first time.

280
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,960
Number two.

281
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,340
Oh, I have to press it every time.

282
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,720
OK, what is this?

283
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,160
Sorry.

284
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,340
Wait.

285
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,540
Oh, I could have gone up.

286
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,860
OK, there you go.

287
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,140
I'm a little hare.

288
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,600
Pluck me.

289
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:52,780
Ow!

290
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,300
Oh, it worked.

291
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,240
I was dancing?

292
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,760
The game is rigged.

293
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,500
My stuff finally shipped.

294
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,400
I'm so excited.

295
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,340
Where are we going?

296
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,200
Me first!

297
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:04,780
Me first!

298
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:05,740
Oh.

299
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,360
Me first!

300
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,040
Oh, sorry.

301
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,040
To be fair, I was there first.

302
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,220
So...

303
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,300
To be fair...

304
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,200
I didn't know where the line was going to start.

305
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:21,620
OK?

306
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,820
I just thought...

307
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,540
Mint is mint and Mato is Mato.

308
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,760
You don't need to be any different.

309
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,240
Thank you.

310
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,160
So real, how do people just talk with no purpose?

311
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
They make things up on the spot?

312
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,060
I don't know.

313
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,540
All I know is to talk about leather.

314
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,460
Maybe.

315
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,740
I don't know.

316
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,660
Oh!

317
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,980
What if I need to go back down?

318
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,120
Just kidding.

319
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,760
This is where I wanted to go.

320
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,200
Probably.

321
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,880
Thanks for the two of us.

322
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,840
Do you like cookies too?

323
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,240
Do you like your yummy cookies?

324
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,020
Today is your birthday?

325
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,660
No, it's not.

326
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,400
Oh my...

327
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,440
It's not straight enough.

328
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,280
Come on.

329
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:10,820
Come on.

330
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,920
Come on.

331
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,820
So close.

332
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:13,840
So close.

333
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,240
OK.

334
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,280
That looks good.

335
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,240
That looks good.

336
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,840
That looks good.

337
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,980
We happily resonate with introvert Minky.

338
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,280
But wouldn't it be more exciting if I was not an introvert and I could be like...

339
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,800
Oh, today I talked to...

340
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,860
Today I talked to a grandpa.

341
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,160
And he said that he had five raccoons.

342
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,860
And I could tell you that story.

343
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,400
But since I don't talk to people, I can never tell you the story about the five raccoons.

344
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,640
We love you platonically the way you are.

345
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:43,960
Thank you.

346
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,180
Oh my gosh!

347
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,680
My results!

348
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,980
In some way or another...

349
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:49,840
Considerate.

350
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,540
I'm considerate!

351
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,860
If I wanted to watch a normie, I'd watch a normie.

352
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,000
OK.

353
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,180
I'm not.

354
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,400
I don't know how to be.

355
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,700
I'm considerate though.

356
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,280
Oh my gosh.

357
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,120
I'm becoming more normie than you realize.

358
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,620
I prefer the stories of these Donkey Kongs.

359
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,680
What's this?

360
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,220
Oh no!

361
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:18,700
Oh!

362
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,460
Now it looks like my peen is out.

363
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:22,800
OK.

364
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,120
Hold on.

365
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:23,760
Oh!

366
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,300
Sorry!

367
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,720
That was my face.

368
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,820
I'm picking my nose.

369
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:27,720
OK.

370
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,280
Nevermind.

371
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,000
OK.

372
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,300
Hold on.

373
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,420
This is fine.

374
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,220
It's for my own discomfort.

375
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,380
For the comfort of others.

376
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,260
I didn't mean to smack him.

377
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,800
I thought I was going to smack my own face.

378
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:42,940
OK.

379
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,260
Oh no, no, no.

380
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,680
Yeah!

381
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,560
This is...

382
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,260
Yes!

383
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,340
Yes!

384
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,600
Oh sorry.

385
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,980
My head is kind of blocking it.

386
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,480
We got the full signal baby.

387
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,420
This is... Is that reading the room?

388
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,620
Read the WiFi.

389
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,840
Is that reading the room?

390
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,580
I'm a baby.

391
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,320
I'm a ba...

392
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:12,540
Oh.

393
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:16,840
Oh.

394
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:28,410
Huh?

395
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,170
I was just staring at the baby.

396
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,550
I hate when babies stare at me though.

397
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,130
Quit staring.

398
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,190
Don't stare at me baby.

399
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,390
I don't care if I'm enriching you.

400
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,230
Oh, what is that?

401
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:41,950
Run away!

402
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,110
Oh, I think they're playing tag.

403
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,030
Eek!

404
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,850
Oh, I'm it.

405
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,140
Where did my other friend go?

406
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,160
Oh, we're playing tag!

407
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:54,980
Oh...

408
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,600
Huh?

409
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,240
Minto, that's a mirror.

410
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,500
Well shut up!

411
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,360
Row it!

412
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,320
Axen, thank you so much for the tag gifted!

413
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,140
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

414
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,420
And you just joined membership too, didn't you?

415
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,680
Thank you so much!

416
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,620
It's time for the plushie and merch.

417
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,160
In the future there's going to be some quality mint themed casual wear.

418
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,540
I thought that said underwear.

419
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,900
Would you like mint themed underwear?

420
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,900
What kind?

421
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,640
Bandana underwear.

422
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,420
Maybe.

423
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,240
Yes?

424
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,480
What if it's really lacy?

425
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,020
They still care?

426
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,120
The hole in the back?

427
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,020
Oh my gosh.

428
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,560
They're not mine!

429
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,660
They're meant for you to wear.

430
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,040
What do you fear having the snickers with your bum out?

431
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,660
A hormonal phantomos or a certain sticky space bug?

432
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:49,760
P.S.

433
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,180
You smell.

434
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,340
P.S.

435
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:51,820
Love you.

436
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,900
Shut up!

437
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,400
I don't think Matara will get it.

438
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,320
Oh my god, I'm kissing!

439
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,040
This is how you pretend how to...

440
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,020
This is where you learn how to French kiss everybody.

441
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,700
Stick your tongue in there!

442
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,640
Like that, you know?

443
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,540
That's how you learn.

444
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,640
In some way or another...

445
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,980
Considerate.

446
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,260
I'm considerate!

447
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,680
I'm considerate!

448
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,620
I'm considerate!

449
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,880
I'm considerate!

450
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,480
Rabbit is spooky.

451
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,400
Why is he giving me the middle finger?

452
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,300
Rude?

453
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,460
He's not considerate at all.

454
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,400
Number 11.

455
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,560
I wonder how many there are.

456
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,490
Number 11.

457
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,170
Lucky 11.

458
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,240
You like the faucet?

459
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:01,480
What?

460
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:01,800
No.

461
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,540
It's a water fountain.

462
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,720
In you go.

463
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,640
Oh no, I don't know this game.

464
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,300
Wait...

465
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,900
I did it!

466
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,730
I did it.

467
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,690
Number 13.

468
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,030
Number 13.

469
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,210
A friend brought their kid along.

470
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,830
Hey mister, what's this game?

471
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:36,510
Which one?

472
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,650
Bobo Taro Party!

473
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,270
Grab the Bobo Taro Party!

474
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,330
The other one was the Lion King probably.

475
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,310
You are in rare form tonight.

476
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,610
What do you mean by that?

477
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:01,870
What?

478
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,350
What do you mean by that?

479
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,350
What if I just get the edge?

480
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,570
I was so close.

481
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,230
Try again.

482
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,510
Giant rice ball is coming right up.

483
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,590
Thanks for waiting.

484
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,710
On the table.

485
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,310
On the table.

486
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,970
On the table.

487
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,330
In the middle.

488
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,720
They mean you are cuter than normal.

489
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,860
I'm considerate.

490
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,300
Yeah!

491
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,860
In some way or another.

492
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,400
Why does she look like that?

493
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,460
Why is she so upset at him?

494
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,180
Why?

495
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,480
Hold on, let's join in on the judgment.

496
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,820
We are joining in.

497
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,460
Actually no, I think this is too judgy.

498
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,220
You can photoshop yourself on the other side.

499
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:31,130
And then it's like I'm judging you with all your little rice balls.

500
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:33,530
You know?

501
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,090
He took all the food.

502
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,230
What if she doesn't like rice balls?

503
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,730
What if he... Look, he's blushing.

504
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:42,970
He's like...

505
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,070
I'm...

506
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,730
The rice... What if he's giving them... What if he's proposing to her with them?

507
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,090
You're stinkier than usual.

508
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,970
I'm not stinky at all!

509
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,330
Moo, I'm a cow.

510
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,230
This is a cheese colored soup.

511
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,130
What's my favorite kind of cookie?

512
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,770
Today... This is not answering your question.

513
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:13,090
I'm sorry.

514
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,690
Today I really wanted a donut.

515
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,690
So I went to the donut place.

516
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,450
I went to Dunkin Donuts.

517
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,530
And I got a donut.

518
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,010
And I got some coffee.

519
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,910
Except they forgot my donut.

520
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,650
And so I said... I went back and I was like...

521
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,830
Please, you forgot my donut.

522
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,670
So they gave me two donuts!

523
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,010
Yummy!

524
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,190
I got two donuts.

525
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,850
Yeah, that's not a cookie.

526
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,350
My favorite cookie might be...

527
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,670
Okay, the ghost ones.

528
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:42,930
The Pillsbury ghost ones.

529
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,730
They released those seasonal sugar cookies.

530
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,670
I really like those.

531
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,550
And then also oatmeal cookies.

532
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,950
Oatmeal raisins.

533
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,150
Cookies.

534
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:54,810
Yeah.

535
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,250
Angel, thanks for the gift!

536
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,510
They forgot my donut.

537
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,790
And I got two donuts.

538
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,770
Number 16.

539
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,390
Why am I so... Oh, there we go.

540
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:13,630
Sorry.

541
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,030
Oh, wait.

542
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,850
Oh, now I'm normal.

543
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:19,130
Okay.

544
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,010
Oh

545
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,960
my gosh.

546
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,020
I was almost so in sync.

547
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,940
She gave us the fave donut.

548
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,640
Oh, give us the fave... Oh, Boston cream donut.

549
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,800
Or chocolate glazed donut, but I like Boston cream.

550
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,480
They say you don't have anecdotes in small talk.

551
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,520
It's finally my turn!

552
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:49,900
Wait.

553
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,540
Oh, please seat yourself where you like.

554
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,060
I'm gonna sit at the bar.

555
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,800
In the corner.

556
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,540
Boston cream is so good.

557
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,100
So good, right?

558
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,060
And then I also like the chocolate glazed.

559
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,740
Depends on what I'm into.

560
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,400
Or what I'm in the mood for.

561
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,640
Oh, my eyeball.

562
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:24,890
I'm looking.

563
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,250
We're fine.

564
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,050
We don't look upset.

565
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,290
Oh, we don't stare.

566
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:29,890
We don't stare.

567
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,750
We don't stare.

568
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:33,550
We're fine.

569
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,010
We're fine.

570
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:34,390
We're fine.

571
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,230
Welcome to the zoo.

572
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,130
Wait, I wanna be the poop.

573
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,630
This rap is disgusting.

574
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,330
Stinky.

575
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,490
Let's see.

576
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,350
Today is the field trip.

577
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,670
Hey, you wanna trade lunches?

578
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,470
Oh, hey, you wanna trade lunches?

579
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,790
I'll trade you this for mine.

580
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,330
You can get a tomato.

581
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,370
What was he trading me?

582
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,600
Terra, welcome to membership.

583
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,420
Thank you.

584
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,420
Was that Thriller?

585
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,420
No.

586
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,060
It's some way or another.

587
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,600
Considerate.

588
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,700
You guys, I'm killing it.

589
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,500
What is that?

590
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,220
It's not like a takoyaki.

591
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,680
It was a meatball.

592
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,600
Oh, I should've given one of my little octopuses, huh?

593
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,020
No, I should've given it my wiener.

594
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

595
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,860
The wiener taco.

596
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,860
Wake up, my sweet you.

597
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,340
Today is your... Don't say birthday.

598
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,640
Please, no more birthdays!

599
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,260
Retro511, welcome to membership.

600
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,200
Oh, it's your 18th birthday.

601
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:23,780
Say hello politely when you get to the castle.

602
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,040
Alright, off you go.

603
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,560
Happy birthday, Minky.

604
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,940
But it's my birthday.

605
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,460
How else would I learn about the world?

606
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,120
Am I wearing... I'm wearing pants, right?

607
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,600
It kind of looks like my butt's out.

608
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,920
Well, that's the perfect place to go then.

609
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,760
My butt's out.

610
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,220
Happy birthday to me, baby.

611
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,900
It's my treat, so pick whatever sounds good.

612
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,040
Parfait for two.

613
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,520
Well, that means I can shower.

614
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,180
It's a five-star surprise!

615
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,620
Thanks for the five characters!

616
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,200
I should probably get something kind of cheap though, right?

617
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,260
Like a chicken rice bowl.

618
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,760
But what if I'm allergic to chicken?

619
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,640
The grill is only a dollar more.

620
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,820
Well, we probably should get two.

621
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:24,420
Sorry sir, I guess I'm only eating for what you can share a plate.

622
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,020
Mint wiener!

623
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,460
Oh.

624
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,920
Wait, I... No, I pressed... I pressed it though.

625
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,580
I pressed it.

626
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,120
Uh-oh, maybe I got too close.

627
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:48,920
Oopsie.

628
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
My friend.

629
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,920
This is... There we go.

630
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,160
Oh.

631
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,280
Dear sir.

632
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,100
Wait, it's on this side, right?

633
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,460
It's on this side or this side?

634
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:12,960
Uh-oh, I don't know.

635
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,400
Oh, I have to wet the stamps?

636
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:20,600
Oopsie.

637
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,720
Oh no!

638
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,060
Man, I'm so hungry.

639
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,140
I know, right?

640
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,460
Is this Grave of the Fireflies?

641
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,960
Is that Anpanman?

642
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,580
If you're hungry, take a bite of my head.

643
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,100
I

644
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,830
like Baikinman more.

645
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,070
Immediate results.

646
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,650
Truly, mildly considerate.

647
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,610
Still considerate.

648
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,610
Another bite of 87.

649
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,310
She's hungry after two donuts.

650
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,530
I only had one donut.

651
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,330
Thank you.

652
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,630
Me now.

653
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:26,810
Single file.

654
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,230
You didn't even eat the one he gave you.

655
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,670
But also, it was Grave of the Fireflies.

656
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,870
It's an eat or be eaten world.

657
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,050
It's a dog-eat-dog world.

658
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:48,230
You have to be... You know, the Grave of the Fireflies, those kids died because they didn't have anything to eat, so they have to eat all...

659
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,380
Oh my gosh.

660
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,560
I just stay still.

661
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,460
Because they're painting me.

662
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,800
But what if I...

663
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,580
No brain.

664
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,100
Just kidding.

665
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,740
You thought.

666
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,360
What if I...

667
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,780
Just kidding.

668
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,020
I wouldn't do that to you.

669
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,660
You're painting.

670
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,560
Don't worry about it.

671
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,540
Who wants a squeeze of lemon?

672
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,360
Oh.

673
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:25,960
Oh.

674
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,400
Sorry.

675
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,180
I thought everybody had their hands up.

676
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,370
What is going to happen?

677
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,120
I would eat that thing whole.

678
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,020
I didn't think that it would actually work.

679
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,980
Thanks for the five gifted.

680
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,060
Teach him a lesson.

681
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,880
Now then, which one of you broke the flower vase?

682
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,040
Keep your heads down, everyone.

683
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,760
Would the guilty party please honestly raise your hand?

684
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,220
Oh my god!

685
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,060
Oh, sorry.

686
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,980
Please put your hands down again.

687
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,500
You can all sit up again now.

688
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,580
I saw.

689
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,900
I saw everything.

690
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,420
I saw everything.

691
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,120
I saw everything!

692
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,550
Oh my god.

693
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:32,970
School play!

694
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:37,670
Once upon a time in a far away land...

695
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,210
There lived an old man...

696
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,210
And an old woman...

697
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:44,470
And...

698
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:48,210
Oh, the old man went to...

699
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:52,230
The mountain for firewood.

700
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,210
And the old woman did...

701
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,530
The washing in the river.

702
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:01,610
What's next?

703
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:06,710
In some way or another...

704
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,430
Consider it.

705
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:14,070
Why would they do a play line by line like that?

706
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,650
Sounds horrible.

707
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,430
I did a play once.

708
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,370
I was supposed to be...

709
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,050
Or rather, it was a play.

710
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,750
And it was of Cinderella.

711
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:32,270
And the teacher who...

712
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,430
Who was giving the part said...

713
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,970
You, Mint, would be Cinderella.

714
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,110
You're perfect for the part.

715
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,450
I was like, yay!

716
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,070
But then...

717
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,170
But then, I did not get Cinderella.

718
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,390
I got the part of the Fairy Godmother.

719
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,510
Because...

720
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,390
The girl who got Cinderella...

721
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,450
This happens every year.

722
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,790
This happens every year.

723
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:54,850
Or it happened every year.

724
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,410
Because the girl who got Cinderella...

725
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,630
Her mom...

726
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:07,730
Her mom always gave the school all of the tech equipment and lighting and sound and everything like that.

727
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:09,790
So...

728
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:13,830
So, she always got the main part.

729
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,970
Even as a kid, I would be like...

730
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,290
This isn't fair.

731
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,890
This isn't fair.

732
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:26,950
Yeah, bribed her way to being the main role for every play.

733
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,190
Every play every year, we had one.

734
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,090
It was so messed up.

735
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,690
I wanted to be Cinderella.

736
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,750
Now, I'll never be able to be Cinderella.

737
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,090
I'm stuck as a god damn Fairy Godmother.

738
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:42,210
No!

739
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,390
I don't want to be the Fairy Godmother.

740
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,370
I'm so angry.

741
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:45,430
I'm still angry.

742
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,370
Adventurer's Tavern.

743
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,570
That's when I learned that life is cruel.

744
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:52,310
Excuse me.

745
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,550
I'm looking for travel buddies.

746
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,190
Oh, travel buddies.

747
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,010
Lum!

748
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,490
I mean, I can't go wrong with a demon.

749
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,170
Life is cruel.

750
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,150
Afterlife is cruel.

751
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,110
You can never win.

752
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,150
You're Cinderella in my heart, Mito.

753
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,150
Cinderelly, Cinderelly.

754
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,730
Night and day, it's Cinderelly.

755
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:18,490
Do the dishes, and the washing, and the cooking, and the cleaning, and the dishes, and the washing.

756
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,970
Minky is Cinderella in our hearts.

757
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,410
Cut my hair, please.

758
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,230
What if I... I'm having a hard day.

759
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,570
I need someone to lean on.

760
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:31,750
Oh my goodness.

761
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:32,910
Never mind.

762
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:33,750
I think I'm possessed.

763
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:34,170
Hold on.

764
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,690
How far does it go?

765
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:37,830
Okay, just there.

766
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:38,630
Sorry.

767
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,070
I just needed somebody to lean on.

768
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,590
This isn't my stop.

769
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,170
It's not my stop.

770
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,230
Then I shouldn't get off.

771
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:58,410
Right?

772
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:58,910
Oh!

773
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:02,030
Okay, this is what you do in Japan when it's like this, right?

774
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,690
If it's really busy, you do this.

775
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,690
And then you stand here.

776
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,350
And you wait for people to get off.

777
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,650
And then you go back on.

778
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,110
That's what you do.

779
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:13,870
Don't worry, Mito.

780
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:14,990
You're still my princess.

781
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:17,730
I'm not the princess!

782
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,390
I'm the maid!

783
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,590
That's maybe why I could never be Cinderella.

784
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,810
Because I'm just always a maid.

785
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,070
But wait, Cinderella, it was a maid to her family.

786
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,270
But she got to be made into a princess.

787
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,410
I'll never be able to be made into a princess.

788
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,830
I'll always just be the maid.

789
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,720
It's cherry blossom season.

790
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,940
You can find us a spot, right?

791
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,280
Who's there?

792
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:50,940
Oh, okay.

793
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,440
Nobody's there, but you know.

794
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,040
I'll go to the very edge.

795
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,120
The tippy-tippy toe.

796
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:55,580
There we go.

797
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,060
Oh, you can't see.

798
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,280
See?

799
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,100
Look at that.

800
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:03,160
We're being considerate because we're not overstepping their thing.

801
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,140
But what if they want more company?

802
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,440
Oh, see?

803
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,880
Everybody gets to see.

804
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,340
Perfect.

805
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,700
Queen never cry.

806
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,520
Queen never cry.

807
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:29,380
Our subway stop is always crowded and nobody moves to let you out.

808
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,480
You have to fight your way out.

809
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:30,800
No!

810
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,140
It's so annoying.

811
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,040
Whisper never cry.

812
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:36,880
That's not true.

813
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,080
Very vaguely considerate.

814
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,800
But still, considerate.

815
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,520
Number 36.

816
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,020
I sounded like Spongebob.

817
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,620
I sounded like Spongebob laugh.

818
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:01,830
Oh, gosh.

819
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,650
Oh, gorsh.

820
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,890
Properly wearing your mask.

821
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:11,890
Considerate.

822
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,650
Number 37.

823
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,290
Taking a relative's kid out to eat.

824
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,270
Spinning sushi!

825
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:23,070
Considerate.

826
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,630
Number 38.

827
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,390
I go to the spinning sushi for me.

828
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:30,930
Oh...

829
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,650
I'm getting high.

830
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:36,270
Considerate.

831
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:38,110
I don't pass out in there.

832
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:39,190
I'm considerate.

833
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,670
Number 39.

834
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:43,390
Thank you!

835
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:47,090
Did I just...

836
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,810
Did I just lose them?

837
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,150
Oh my god!

838
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:51,850
Oh my god!

839
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,570
He took my pants!

840
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,230
Considerate.

841
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:02,030
Hits the guy next to me, so he...

842
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,290
will give them back.

843
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,030
Number 40.

844
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,950
I hope he doesn't see the little hole in the back.

845
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,130
And now, a word from the principal.

846
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:18,730
Good morning, everyone!

847
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:25,010
The weather's been warming up lately, and it's really starting to feel like the summer.

848
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,550
That summer sun is scorching, huh?

849
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:31,110
Make sure you don't get too much sun...

850
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,510
Candy store on the way home.

851
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,690
They wanted it to be fast, so that they could go on a summer vacation.

852
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:05,150
Six months!

853
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,170
Truly mildly...

854
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:13,050
considerate.

855
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,290
I like the turtle.

856
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:19,390
Is that good?

857
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,490
What's the best considerate you could get?

858
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:26,190
Flowing noodles party!

859
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,490
Beat the summer heat!

860
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:28,550
Flowing noodles!

861
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:29,870
We can eat as much as we want!

862
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:31,970
How do I do this?

863
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:38,990
Oh no!

864
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:42,350
OK, it needs to go at a moderate speed.

865
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,450
You'll eat children!

866
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:46,930
You'll eat children!

867
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:48,350
Oh my gosh.

868
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:50,430
Why is it so hard being a noodle?

869
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:52,150
There we go.

870
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:52,890
Eat it!

871
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:53,410
Grab it!

872
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:54,550
Grab it!

873
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,740
Mike, thanks for six months too!

874
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,100
Me too, I'm so considerate.

875
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,120
I am.

876
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,060
Aren't I?

877
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,660
What is this?

878
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,120
Oh!

879
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,060
Wow!

880
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:12,920
Sweaty.

881
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,220
Sweaty.

882
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:15,560
Sweaty.

883
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,080
Sweaty.

884
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,940
You're doing great, sweaty.

885
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,480
Forty-three.

886
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:34,890
Shhh...

887
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:36,470
Shhh...

888
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:38,130
Shhh...

889
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:39,330
Oh!

890
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:40,590
That's the perfect temperature.

891
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,630
I'm the most considerate egg ever!

892
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,070
Oh my gosh!

893
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:50,970
Mince my sweaty.

894
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:52,830
Says who?

895
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:54,070
Jesse!

896
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,150
Make the girl sweaty.

897
00:46:58,890 --> 00:46:59,070
Oh!

898
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,410
January hot.

899
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:01,850
February hot.

900
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:06,270
March is still cold.

901
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:06,790
Hot.

902
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:09,110
All hail Stinky Minky.

903
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:09,390
OK.

904
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:11,710
Now...

905
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:12,830
Cold.

906
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:13,490
Cold.

907
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:14,850
Have cold.

908
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:15,210
OK.

909
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:15,950
Cold.

910
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:16,290
Cold.

911
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:16,630
Cold.

912
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:18,590
Yeah.

913
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:20,730
Yeah.

914
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:28,230
I like how in Japan you can get the hot drinks in the winter time and the cold drinks in the summer time.

915
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:28,790
So good.

916
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,770
I want hot coffee year round.

917
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:33,050
Oh, maybe I should have left one.

918
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:36,650
But that's like electricity.

919
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:38,770
You're not being very considerate.

920
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:39,610
You know that?

921
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:46,990
If you ask for all cold and one hot, you know how much more electricity that's using than just keeping them all cold or all hot?

922
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:49,350
You're not being very considerate.

923
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:51,050
Think of the environment.

924
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:52,370
Gosh!

925
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:01,410
SOS!

926
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:02,810
Foreigner!

927
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:06,890
I should have taken a picture.

928
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:10,070
In some way or another...

929
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:10,970
Considerate.

930
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:12,130
Look at the turtles.

931
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:12,970
They're so cute.

932
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:16,670
Wouldn't heating be way less energy?

933
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:19,910
Yes, but only one?

934
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:21,730
You'll be mine.

935
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:23,150
Welcome to membership.

936
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,500
The rabbit.

937
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,800
Today is our date on a cruise?

938
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,000
Since we're here, why don't we go do that thing?

939
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:43,800
Oh,

940
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,020
I have to hug her.

941
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,460
Press A.

942
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:50,080
Oh, sorry.

943
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,260
Press B to hug.

944
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:00,720
Yeah, baby.

945
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,160
I love doing that.

946
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,240
Press B to hug.

947
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,960
What am I doing?

948
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:08,520
Oh, no!

949
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:08,800
Wait!

950
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,980
This is gonna be my thumbnail.

951
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:11,360
Oh my gosh.

952
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,040
I gotta get out of the way and tie my shoes.

953
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:16,800
What have I got back?

954
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,540
Okay, now I'm taking my spot again.

955
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,480
Oh, sorry.

956
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,980
I was walking in front of you before.

957
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:29,060
So, honestly, I deserve to take my spot again in front of you.

958
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:34,700
What if we're going to the famous pastry place and I was in front of them.

959
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:39,060
I had to tie my shoe, but I was in front of them the whole time.

960
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,980
And we get to there and they're sold out.

961
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,640
He would've taken my spot.

962
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,680
I would've never gotten it.

963
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,040
His birthright.

964
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:48,880
His spot.

965
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,120
The last bread.

966
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:53,860
Yeah, exactly.

967
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,440
Grow big.

968
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,960
Grow big.

969
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,060
Grow big little saplings.

970
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,530
Let's pull our money and buy candy at the store to share.

971
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,810
Something to share.

972
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:22,790
Baseball and chips?

973
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:24,530
Oh my boy.

974
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:25,470
So funny.

975
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:26,670
Let's get some donuts.

976
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,350
I got donuts today.

977
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:30,110
I will get donuts.

978
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:32,030
Oh, play 50 questions and consider it.

979
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,350
I'm half way there.

980
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:34,910
Some way or another.

981
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:36,010
Consider it.

982
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:37,110
Bakemon.

983
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:42,050
Wait, what is Obabake?

984
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:45,070
What is Obabake?

985
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:46,990
That's not me though.

986
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,500
Wake up my darling.

987
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:58,020
You?

988
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:58,660
Oh no.

989
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,240
Don't say it.

990
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,780
It's not my birthday is it?

991
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,580
Please don't say birthday.

992
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,860
Don't say birthday.

993
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,780
Today is your 30th birthday!

994
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,280
You get your first subordinate.

995
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:19,940
What?

996
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,100
What?

997
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:28,860
Go to the castle and mentor the next generation.

998
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,220
Alright, off you go.

999
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,200
A sub...

1000
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:36,960
A sub...

1001
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,040
A sub...

1002
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,200
Go to mentor time!

1003
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,880
In the end, I chose my own path.

1004
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,620
What should I have for lunch today?

1005
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,520
Oh, hello sir.

1006
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,500
Would you mind if I ate lunch with you?

1007
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:56,540
Sure.

1008
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,280
Come here.

1009
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:14,070
I'm a... I'm a... I'm a... I'm a... I'm a you of few words.

1010
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:17,230
Take as much as you want.

1011
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:21,330
I'll be honest, I don't really like the pig bowl.

1012
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,470
That's how much as I want.

1013
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:26,030
What do I do with the rest?

1014
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:28,250
What do I... actually I...

1015
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,550
Oh no, that's mine.

1016
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:31,890
I don't want so much of it.

1017
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,110
Grab the whole bowl.

1018
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:44,930
I don't want it though.

1019
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:46,230
I don't like it.

1020
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:47,210
I don't like the taste.

1021
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:48,530
Oh!

1022
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:54,370
Oh, it was full.

1023
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,330
lol

1024
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:13,100
Sorry, I was that person.

1025
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:16,220
The bus.

1026
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,520
Oh man!

1027
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,030
Why is the... Wait!

1028
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:30,630
Oh no!

1029
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:32,870
Oh, it's a schoolgirl.

1030
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,330
We stopped the bus for her.

1031
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:37,810
You're welcome!

1032
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:39,750
You're welcome.

1033
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,310
You're welcome, schoolgirl.

1034
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:44,350
Do do do do.

1035
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,790
In some way or another...

1036
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:52,010
Consider it.

1037
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:52,670
Umai.

1038
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:55,430
Umai bowl.

1039
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:58,730
It is a joke about umai bowl.

1040
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:00,770
Which are these.

1041
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:01,930
I don't know what they are made out of.

1042
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:03,730
They are just like these...

1043
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:04,770
Maybe like corn.

1044
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:06,530
Corn sticks.

1045
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:10,430
And they taste good and they are really fluffy.

1046
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:16,010
When you eat them, they're There you... you... you eat it.

1047
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:17,510
Yeah, it's like a Cheeto.

1048
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:18,410
Yes, yes, yes.

1049
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:19,310
Like a big Cheeto.

1050
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:20,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1051
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:22,090
But it's like a tube Cheeto.

1052
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:23,730
And it's just...

1053
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:25,930
It's so delicious.

1054
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:28,690
Cheeto puff.

1055
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:30,130
Oh, dada.

1056
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:33,050
What a good kid you are.

1057
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:38,030
If only things could stay like this forever.

1058
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:50,210
I made them...

1059
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:52,370
The stranger moved next door.

1060
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:55,670
What was that?

1061
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:57,890
That was like Puyo, but creepy.

1062
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,650
I'm new here.

1063
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:03,230
Can't believe how inconsiderate the streamer is.

1064
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:03,730
No!

1065
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:12,250
It's his bald head.

1066
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:12,850
It's reflecting.

1067
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:15,630
Work!

1068
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:16,570
Keep working!

1069
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:17,450
Keep working!

1070
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:21,270
But don't you like the sunlight?

1071
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:24,390
Can I let you know that you're not working out, you know?

1072
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:29,070
What else do I do?

1073
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:29,310
OK.

1074
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:32,230
Solar flare!

1075
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:34,970
Yeah, I want the natural light.

1076
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:48,020
I can't believe... I can't believe Godzilla can now like...

1077
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,880
Do Fortnite dances.

1078
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,380
I can't believe Godzilla can hit the gritty.

1079
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,180
I can't believe this.

1080
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,480
I can't believe this.

1081
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:01,180
I just...

1082
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,560
I can't believe this.

1083
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,740
Also, I heard... Tell me if this is true or not.

1084
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,740
But I heard that Godzilla is in Fortnite, but they couldn't get the license for his roar.

1085
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,960
So what does he sound like then?

1086
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,140
If he can't do his...

1087
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,890
I think that was a pretty good impression, actually.

1088
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:30,450
That's what he sounds like.

1089
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,090
He just sounds like a normal dude.

1090
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:37,650
He's like...

1091
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,430
His roar is just an elbow scream.

1092
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,330
Do Fortnite stream win?

1093
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:50,510
Maybe I'll play with Doki.

1094
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:54,050
I have Snake and... Well, I didn't get Raiden.

1095
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:55,890
Squire!

1096
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:56,770
Welcome to membership!

1097
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:58,190
I like your profile picture.

1098
00:56:59,330 --> 00:56:59,730
Minky.

1099
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:00,610
That's me.

1100
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:04,470
Oh no!

1101
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:08,230
Right on the kisser.

1102
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:10,370
Alright, now kiss it to make it feel better.

1103
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:15,610
Does it feel better?

1104
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:22,310
I can't believe... Oh wait, hold on.

1105
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:23,170
What is this?

1106
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,230
There you go.

1107
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:35,220
Oh, you got a lot of rice there.

1108
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,280
He's touching his thumb a little bit.

1109
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:49,080
Okay, I need to ask this too.

1110
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:54,340
When you eat curry, do you like your curry and your rice separate?

1111
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,320
Not like separate bowls or anything, but like...

1112
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:04,340
When I pour rice and curry, I put my rice on one side and my curry on the other side.

1113
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,060
You don't like curry?

1114
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,240
No!

1115
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,940
There's different kinds of curry.

1116
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,400
Side by side.

1117
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,180
Yeah, I like it side by side too.

1118
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,000
I prefer it mixed, but then you don't have the flavor of the rice.

1119
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,280
The curry overpowers it.

1120
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,020
Never had curry.

1121
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:36,320
If you don't like curry, this is my recipe.

1122
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,700
You get the mild mix of the golden curry.

1123
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:44,660
And you put in the potatoes, and you put in the carrots, and you put in the onion.

1124
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,180
And then you put in the applesauce.

1125
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,940
Yeah, then you put in the applesauce.

1126
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:57,480
And it helps thicken it up and also gives a sweet, sweet apple taste.

1127
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:58,900
Oh, and the chicken.

1128
00:58:59,200 --> 00:58:59,920
The chicken too.

1129
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,400
It's so yummy.

1130
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,680
It's so yummy.

1131
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,020
I promise.

1132
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:08,640
Let's see.

1133
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,940
Very vaguely considerate.

1134
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,160
Why?

1135
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,780
That's not a lot of considerate though, right?

1136
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:16,880
I thought I was pretty considerate this time.

1137
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:20,620
Skims.

1138
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,740
Today is our date at a cafe.

1139
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,740
What am I doing?

1140
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,460
I have to have some drink.

1141
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,940
I'm not trying to finish it.

1142
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,580
I'm just trying to... I'm literally only having sips.

1143
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:41,540
I

1144
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:48,570
need a backwash.

1145
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:49,770
What do you know?

1146
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:52,710
I was only trying to drink half.

1147
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:59,430
But if I only drink half, then I wouldn't have... It reached my mouth.

1148
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:02,010
Just a little bit.

1149
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:14,650
OK, but you guys say ew, but if you had the chance to drink an anime girl's backwash, I know you would.

1150
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:15,170
OK?

1151
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:16,930
Don't act like you are better than me.

1152
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:20,070
Don't act like you are holier than thou now, OK?

1153
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:24,110
You would be like, you guys are just like...

1154
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:25,750
Sweaty girl.

1155
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:28,890
But you draw the line at backwash?

1156
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:29,270
OK.

1157
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:33,970
I don't want to hear it from you all.

1158
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:41,860
Coco curry level 10 spice with cheese and pork.

1159
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:42,720
Cutlet.

1160
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,920
Side by side with Thai tea.

1161
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,880
If it was mint, 110% yes.

1162
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:48,880
Nasty.

1163
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,520
Can't hold it in any longer.

1164
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:56,310
Restroom.

1165
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:57,510
This way.

1166
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:58,090
Restroom.

1167
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:03,570
Wait, I think I made it too big and he thought that was the restroom.

1168
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:07,680
Oopsie.

1169
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:09,400
Lily boys.

1170
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:09,560
Please.

1171
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,460
May have more condemnable ship.

1172
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,440
Thank you!

1173
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,720
Good heavens, the bamboo is glowing.

1174
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,140
Is something inside?

1175
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,360
Oh my gosh, we have to not...

1176
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,880
Oh, wait, don't kill the baby.

1177
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,400
We were expecting some kind of...

1178
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:34,800
Wow!

1179
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:37,460
Mockback.

1180
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:38,760
What do you mean by that?

1181
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,640
David Seal, thank you for the 50th gift!

1182
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,300
Thank you!

1183
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,240
I'm thinking.

1184
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:43,720
I'm thinking.

1185
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:46,700
I'm thinking.

1186
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:53,360
Mighty Wobb, welcome to Bubble Ship.

1187
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:53,800
Thank you.

1188
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,400
I want that spit on...

1189
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,780
Bring it on you monster!

1190
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,660
I didn't know what to do!

1191
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,940
I think I was supposed to stand in front of him, right?

1192
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,460
Very vaguely considerate.

1193
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,680
Why is the screen giving Exit 8 vibes?

1194
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,900
Nothing to see here, folks.

1195
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:38,750
So, do you want us to be freaky about you or not?

1196
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:40,970
Your answer will change my behavior.

1197
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:47,490
Well, see, be true to yourself.

1198
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:50,470
Be true to yourself.

1199
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,010
Blink!

1200
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:52,670
Welcome to membership.

1201
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:53,310
Thank you.

1202
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:58,340
Take this, you monster!

1203
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,620
Did it work?

1204
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,000
So

1205
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:14,240
be freaky?

1206
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:17,260
Yeah, be freaky if you must be freaky.

1207
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,360
I can handle the freak.

1208
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,820
But don't, you know, not everybody can handle the freak.

1209
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,520
But I can handle your freak.

1210
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,920
Most considerate ghost mid.

1211
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:33,240
I am the freak martyr.

1212
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:38,960
I will absorb the freak so no others have to deal with the freak.

1213
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:40,880
I understand.

1214
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:41,360
It's okay.

1215
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,440
I can take it.

1216
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:44,160
I will take it.

1217
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,660
Then no others will have to deal with this freak.

1218
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,160
Me!

1219
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:51,860
What am I doing?

1220
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:57,570
Wait.

1221
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:01,050
I'm moonwalking.

1222
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:01,950
I'm moonwalking.

1223
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:02,810
I'm moonwalking.

1224
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:03,690
I'm moonwalking.

1225
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:05,010
I'm moonwalking.

1226
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:05,850
I'm moonwalking.

1227
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:06,670
I'm moonwalking.

1228
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:18,650
Visiting a business partner.

1229
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:20,590
They are expecting us at 3 o'clock.

1230
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:21,390
Got it.

1231
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:43,760
Considerate.

1232
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,000
Oh I got an achievement right on target.

1233
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:53,280
Number 69 The class change seats.

1234
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,680
Why do I

1235
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:04,260
have such a big head?

1236
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:06,560
Nice.

1237
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,100
I have such a big head.

1238
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,700
Backup nerd.

1239
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,700
Backup nerd.

1240
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:17,640
Wait.

1241
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:18,980
No, no, no.

1242
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,700
I'm trying not to...

1243
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,620
Did you get this part?

1244
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,900
You got this part now?

1245
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:30,740
OK.

1246
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:32,820
OK.

1247
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:33,980
Oh this is good.

1248
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:37,420
Sayonara!

1249
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:42,780
Alright.

1250
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:43,700
Nice.

1251
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,800
Very vaguely considerate.

1252
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:46,740
What do you mean?

1253
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,780
But I was so considerate.

1254
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,360
I was so considerate.

1255
01:05:55,320 --> 01:06:00,620
I should say that I'm the most considerate.

1256
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:06,960
71 I'm scared.

1257
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:11,660
If you rescue a crane, a beautiful lady appears.

1258
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,860
But my grandma punched a crane.

1259
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,680
I'll weave some cloth for you.

1260
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:19,260
Please don't look in here until I say it's alright.

1261
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:24,860
What a dork.

1262
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,720
He's so easy to fool.

1263
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:31,320
Now I'll just do this and this.

1264
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,020
Alright.

1265
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,160
It turned out great.

1266
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:35,560
Wait.

1267
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,160
What do you mean?

1268
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:39,380
I wove the very finest of cloth.

1269
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:41,840
The cloth ought to please even that man.

1270
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:46,720
She never said look.

1271
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,080
Am I easy?

1272
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:53,740
Yeah, I think so.

1273
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:55,560
Pretty lady.

1274
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,920
When the last leaf falls, my time will come.

1275
01:06:59,180 --> 01:06:59,760
No, no, no.

1276
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,180
Oh no.

1277
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,840
She even had the dead mom hair.

1278
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:09,220
Oh no.

1279
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,140
Oh my gosh.

1280
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,080
What was I seeing?

1281
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:12,080
Something.

1282
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,100
For some reason, this thought made me think of it.

1283
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,200
There's some anime.

1284
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:20,640
I think it's like...

1285
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,040
Not the heroine anime.

1286
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:22,880
Oh gosh.

1287
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:24,600
I saw a tweet about it the other day.

1288
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:26,480
Where...

1289
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,240
It might have showed up on your timelines too.

1290
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:30,420
But someone was just like, I'm so mad.

1291
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:31,800
Because...

1292
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,860
This anime is so bad.

1293
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,680
The guy... The girl...

1294
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,820
Goes into a coma and then gets out.

1295
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,440
It's a recent anime.

1296
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,600
And then...

1297
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:44,320
And then...

1298
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,260
And then he goes with the other girl.

1299
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,860
Because his girlfriend is in the...

1300
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:51,080
In the hospital.

1301
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:54,540
And...

1302
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:55,740
He's like, welcome to membership.

1303
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,480
No, not erased.

1304
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,520
Oh, I think it was domestic girlfriend.

1305
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,560
Yeah, I think it was domestic girlfriend.

1306
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:03,280
I saw someone being upset about it.

1307
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:04,960
They were just like, oh, this happened.

1308
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:08,520
But they described exactly everything that happens in Kimi no Zou.

1309
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:10,280
I was just like...

1310
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,080
No way.

1311
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:11,880
First time?

1312
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,480
Is this like... Is domestic girlfriend...

1313
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,720
Kimi no Zou for Gen Z?

1314
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:25,180
I was like, no way.

1315
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:26,940
I can't believe this is happening again.

1316
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,100
It was so funny.

1317
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:30,720
I saw it.

1318
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,160
I wanted to comment and be like, oh no.

1319
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:35,220
You should watch Kimi no Zou.

1320
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:40,580
Oh, what's happening?

1321
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:42,680
Two?

1322
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:43,240
Wait.

1323
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:45,900
What's going on?

1324
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:49,340
Oh, I sneezed.

1325
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:51,420
Under the table dweller.

1326
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,080
What does that mean?

1327
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:56,680
Time is a flat circle.

1328
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,100
So true.

1329
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:00,800
No, stay away thoughts.

1330
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,420
Stay away thoughts.

1331
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:05,720
Yeah, baby.

1332
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,080
I'm doing my horny meditation.

1333
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:15,640
It's horny meditative hours everybody.

1334
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,800
Me on the daily.

1335
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:21,700
Bless you.

1336
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:22,500
Thank you.

1337
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,160
Bakemon card!

1338
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:29,800
Rare card.

1339
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,080
We're

1340
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:37,040
gonna do it... We're gonna give it to the kid.

1341
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,060
You just stirred an old memory with Kimi no Zou.

1342
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,180
Give it to the kid.

1343
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,340
The others are scalpers.

1344
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:50,960
The others are scalpers.

1345
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,720
Rare card for you buddy.

1346
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,680
Rare card for you.

1347
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,480
Moderately considerate.

1348
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,860
Moderately considerate.

1349
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:09,920
Look at this bird.

1350
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,900
What?

1351
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:20,520
I don't want to tell you how to do your job.

1352
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:25,520
But you might want to keep anime girl backwash in your back pocket in case you get a game yourself.

1353
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,320
Nosey.

1354
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,480
Nosey, no.

1355
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,280
Shut up.

1356
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:35,660
Eww.

1357
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:41,980
Nobody will...

1358
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,080
What

1359
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:53,340
would the flavor be?

1360
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,440
Lemon?

1361
01:10:56,980 --> 01:10:57,540
Lemon.

1362
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,000
Gross.

1363
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,500
Oh, they're doing a TikTok.

1364
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,500
Wait, but this actually helps it go viral.

1365
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:14,560
If the cat sits in it, it goes viral.

1366
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:15,320
It goes viral.

1367
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:17,940
People like the cat, you know.

1368
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:20,040
They're like wow, that's so funny.

1369
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,380
The cat got in the video.

1370
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:23,800
It's better.

1371
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:25,020
It's better for the TikTok.

1372
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,180
This is me!

1373
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:51,040
This is MissY, your favorite VTuber signing off.

1374
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,140
Until next time!

1375
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,060
Hot mic.

1376
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,820
Oh hey Mr. Producer, nice work today.

1377
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,120
Our reviews are looking great.

1378
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,220
I totally told you.

1379
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,300
Wait, I totally owe you.

1380
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,680
Oh right, that surprise thing we're planning.

1381
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,260
Our listeners are going to go nuts for it.

1382
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:14,780
I mean come on!

1383
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:21,460
Oh wait, we're gonna... I didn't see anything.

1384
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:27,500
Can't wait for combined anime girl thighs and anime girl back ones.

1385
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:28,120
Stop!

1386
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,740
I didn't see it!

1387
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:31,620
Did you guys see it?

1388
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:39,920
Look brother, fireflies!

1389
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:41,160
So pretty.

1390
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:46,560
Wait, sorry.

1391
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:57,840
I expected her to say she hates her viewers.

1392
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,840
She can't have my thing.

1393
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,900
Listen, can you wake me up in a little bit?

1394
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:09,840
Little bit.

1395
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:15,610
Was that enough you think?

1396
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,120
OK, now it's even.

1397
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,080
OK, now it's an even fight.

1398
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:36,120
Oh my gosh, they're doing so well.

1399
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,240
Very vaguely considerate.

1400
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:50,510
I like how that one was just Doki's neck.

1401
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:56,240
You see your co-worker on a day off.

1402
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:57,980
Oh he's with his girlfriend!

1403
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,640
No...no conversation.

1404
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:16,980
We're all signing this keepsake card.

1405
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:17,940
Oh, it went so fast.

1406
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:19,380
Thank you.

1407
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:20,540
Love.

1408
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,760
Wait, I didn't mean to draw that.

1409
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:34,860
OK, hold on.

1410
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:02,040
What do I get for that?

1411
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:08,060
Thanks for the peach.

1412
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:08,880
OK.

1413
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,500
What was I supposed to do?

1414
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,720
Oh, sign in the card.

1415
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:16,880
Sign in the card.

1416
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,730
Nothing to see.

1417
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:37,130
Dramatic posing!

1418
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:39,230
That was good.

1419
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:41,970
That was so clean.

1420
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:43,650
That was so clean.

1421
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:45,550
Hi there!

1422
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:46,610
I'm the server robot.

1423
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,550
If you need service, leave it to me!

1424
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:52,030
Oh my gosh, I miss Caitlyn.

1425
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:54,170
Darn humans forcing me to work for pennies.

1426
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,230
Look over here, so cute!

1427
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:57,550
Hehe.

1428
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:14,820
Clumsy girl!

1429
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:21,170
That made me miss Caitlyn.

1430
01:16:21,330 --> 01:16:26,050
I've been watching a playthrough of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.

1431
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:30,010
I'm like... I don't know exactly.

1432
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:33,610
I think I'm close to the end.

1433
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:36,470
I don't know if it's the last chapter or not.

1434
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:42,490
But I love... I call him Caitlyn.

1435
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:48,010
I'm obsessed with Cait Sith.

1436
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:48,910
I love him.

1437
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:50,790
I love Caitlyn so much.

1438
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:54,090
I think he's... Oh my gosh, I can't stop thinking about him.

1439
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:55,210
He's so cute!

1440
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,790
And that does remind me of Caitlyn!

1441
01:17:14,290 --> 01:17:15,570
So cute!

1442
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:20,830
I can't stop thinking about him because he's so

1443
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:29,060
handsome and has two bright teeth.

1444
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:31,160
My

1445
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:42,360
god, I love him so much.

1446
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:52,380
Merch up him at the Square Enix cafe.

1447
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,180
I'm gonna buy... Hold on, I need a tissue.

1448
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:59,400
I'm gonna buy all his stuff.

1449
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,080
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1450
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:04,880
Oh my gosh, I just moved my contact down my eye.

1451
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,040
Oh my god!

1452
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:10,320
I can't think about him without crying.

1453
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,880
Oh, he's so cute.

1454
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:18,580
Oh gosh.

1455
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:21,620
And then...

1456
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:25,460
And then he... Last night I saw him...

1457
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:26,980
Basically...

1458
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:31,680
Basically every day after stream I've been watching a little bit more.

1459
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:35,500
It's like my treat for after stream, right?

1460
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:37,580
And I...

1461
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:42,380
I... So...

1462
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:44,720
I... It makes it... I...

1463
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,420
Hold on, I'm getting confused.

1464
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:46,840
Wait.

1465
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:50,540
I wanted to play it, but I just didn't have time.

1466
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:54,140
And I...

1467
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:01,960
So I was like, I'll just watch someone, but it makes me wanna play it now.

1468
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:07,600
It makes me wanna play it, but I was just like, I can't stream this.

1469
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,820
Because I just... I have so many other things to stream.

1470
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:18,600
And if I were... I feel like if I were to be like, hey guys, I'm adding Final Fantasy VII to my playlist...

1471
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:22,900
People would be like, but what about all these other RPGs you talked about?

1472
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:24,820
So...

1473
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,780
I've never played the OG Final Fantasy VII either.

1474
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,920
I know the story, I know about it.

1475
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,940
But, I've never played the original.

1476
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:36,980
Please play Final Fantasy VII.

1477
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:50,640
I'm begging on my knees to play it, please.

1478
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,660
But I'm watching it.

1479
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,160
Right now...

1480
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,860
I... I haven't finished it.

1481
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,380
Probably will finish it tonight.

1482
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:03,500
And then...

1483
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,500
Because I want to...

1484
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,060
I want to...

1485
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:08,660
Then...

1486
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:10,420
The third one.

1487
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:14,700
Three really long games.

1488
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:16,280
I know, I know.

1489
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,180
FFXIV has Old Man Yaoi?

1490
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:19,960
Wait, what?

1491
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:20,260
Really?

1492
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:21,360
Wait, wait.

1493
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,720
It does?

1494
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:25,060
Wait.

1495
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,560
It does?

1496
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,760
Final Fantasy X.

1497
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:35,540
I've played Final Fantasy X.

1498
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:43,690
Thank you for the five gifted.

1499
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:45,430
Should play FFXIV.

1500
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:47,410
That's not...

1501
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:50,150
But FFXIV is the MMO, right?

1502
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:54,350
FFXIV is the MMO though, right?

1503
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:55,570
I don't have time for that.

1504
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:58,470
I don't have time for that.

1505
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:02,630
But the Old Man Yaoi?

1506
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:03,130
Really?

1507
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:04,950
It's got the... It's got the goods.

1508
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:05,870
It's got the good stuff.

1509
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:07,690
It's got the... It's got the good stuff.

1510
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:11,730
I enjoyed Remake and I'm patiently waiting for Rebirth to come on Steam.

1511
01:21:11,890 --> 01:21:13,130
Please hurry Square Enix.

1512
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:14,350
Yeah.

1513
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:18,390
I like Rebirth so far.

1514
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:21,010
I mean, I'm almost to the end.

1515
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:22,470
I think because...

1516
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:24,860
Because he's...

1517
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:27,190
Because Galen is so cute.

1518
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:32,930
They couldn't have made a more perfect character.

1519
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:46,160
No.

1520
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:48,560
No.

1521
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,300
I love Caitlyn.

1522
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,720
Sorry, I really love that guy.

1523
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:02,260
Except when he turns into an old man.

1524
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:03,520
I don't love that.

1525
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:04,840
I just like the cat.

1526
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:06,060
Okay.

1527
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:07,160
Okay.

1528
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:09,560
Okay.

1529
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:12,000
No, let's keep playing the game.

1530
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,840
My sons, look closely.

1531
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:17,000
Alone this arrow is weak and fragile.

1532
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:17,900
Oh my god!

1533
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:21,660
See how easily it breaks.

1534
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:23,520
Even when two arrows put together.

1535
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:25,960
Am I supposed to be doing something?

1536
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:27,420
See?

1537
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,400
The same outcome.

1538
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:31,060
But then three arrows, like the three of you are put together.

1539
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:35,260
I don't know which way I'm supposed to put my thing at.

1540
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:37,280
It's strong.

1541
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:38,360
No, no, no, no.

1542
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,340
There we go.

1543
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,960
I don't know which way I'm supposed to do this.

1544
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,840
I'm sick so I can't smell anything.

1545
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:53,260
It's a perfect time to watch stream.

1546
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:57,460
But you'll miss the smell-o-vision, Eggman.

1547
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,140
13 is long, but it has old man yaoi.

1548
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:04,340
And they just released a new hardest fight.

1549
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:05,520
That's just Yuri.

1550
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:11,420
Very vaguely...

1551
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:17,300
When it's supposed to be the three of them, it was supposed to not break, right?

1552
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:22,200
How am I vaguely considerate?

1553
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,380
Is it because I'm taking too long on the game?

1554
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:26,100
Oh no!

1555
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:30,600
OK, we're fine now.

1556
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:33,580
Hey co-worker.

1557
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:35,880
Hey new guy.

1558
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:39,240
Nice, I was considerate.

1559
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:40,600
Considerate!

1560
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,560
OK, 87.

1561
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:48,340
How will you pay?

1562
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:49,280
With my phone.

1563
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:52,100
Oh, sorry.

1564
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,460
There we go, sorry.

1565
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:01,780
Oh, sorry.

1566
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:02,700
There we go.

1567
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:15,920
One kid's video with a toy...

1568
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:18,220
Wait, it's a VTuber!

1569
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:20,840
I'll put it in the middle.

1570
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,340
You guys can share.

1571
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:31,010
Hey, let me ask you something.

1572
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:31,990
Which teacher is your favorite?

1573
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:33,990
Let me see...

1574
01:24:34,670 --> 01:24:35,850
The sexy one.

1575
01:24:36,590 --> 01:24:39,090
Kind Mr. A or cool Mr. B?

1576
01:24:39,570 --> 01:24:41,530
Oh, regular old Mr. C!

1577
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,630
Kind Mr. A.

1578
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:57,750
No...

1579
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:01,090
Finding out that Kamiyoshi is a huge fan of the same character?

1580
01:25:04,230 --> 01:25:05,290
OK, then.

1581
01:25:07,070 --> 01:25:07,930
See, my lord.

1582
01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:08,950
Oh, sorry.

1583
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:12,030
Very vaguely considerate.

1584
01:25:12,110 --> 01:25:12,390
Why?

1585
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:16,090
Mr. C needed a win today.

1586
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:18,270
Mr. C needs to give less homework then.

1587
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:18,810
OK?

1588
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:25,690
Mr. C then needs to not yell at me in class.

1589
01:25:25,910 --> 01:25:27,690
Mr. C is kind of a jerk.

1590
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:30,630
It's a plappy meal.

1591
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:33,250
What do you mean it's a plappy meal?

1592
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:35,190
What do you mean by that?

1593
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:44,940
Oh, I like to get the veggie.

1594
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:47,240
I'll get one of each.

1595
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,340
Thank you.

1596
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,100
Delicious.

1597
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:57,660
See you again soon.

1598
01:25:57,860 --> 01:25:59,720
Let's go out for BBQ next time.

1599
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:02,420
Oh, bye-bye!

1600
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:15,030
Yummy.

1601
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:20,670
Wait, not yummy.

1602
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:21,010
Sorry.

1603
01:26:21,970 --> 01:26:23,890
I was thinking of hot pot still.

1604
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:39,220
I think I'm hungry.

1605
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:41,060
It didn't wave.

1606
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:41,980
It didn't let me.

1607
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,240
It didn't let me wave.

1608
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:59,040
You have to push a button.

1609
01:26:59,120 --> 01:26:59,620
I did!

1610
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:00,680
I tried!

1611
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:06,000
Let's watch the first sunrise of the new year.

1612
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,860
Oh, the sun appears here.

1613
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,200
The sun appears here.

1614
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:15,960
We all saw it.

1615
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:20,920
See, I didn't want the sun to shine in her eyes.

1616
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,920
My girlfriend's eyes.

1617
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:28,840
What's that?

1618
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:31,120
There's something rustling in there.

1619
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:33,120
What's going on in there, kids?

1620
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:34,780
It's a cat.

1621
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,040
Knock it off, kids.

1622
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,040
Knock it off, kids.

1623
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:50,800
Knock it off, kids.

1624
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:09,340
What's that guy doing here?

1625
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:12,720
Uh...

1626
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,440
I'm confused.

1627
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:24,260
I'm truly mildly concerned.

1628
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:33,270
Oh my god.

1629
01:28:33,870 --> 01:28:34,950
I don't know.

1630
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:37,170
I didn't know what the heck was going on there.

1631
01:28:38,170 --> 01:28:39,750
Apologizing to a business partner.

1632
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:41,910
These things happen the best to the best of us.

1633
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:43,110
We'll bring them some cake, eh?

1634
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:43,770
Okay.

1635
01:28:45,850 --> 01:28:46,850
Sorry, cake.

1636
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:48,690
Candles too, please.

1637
01:28:50,910 --> 01:28:52,070
I see a ghost.

1638
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:52,990
A ghostly maid.

1639
01:28:53,130 --> 01:28:53,590
That's me.

1640
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:56,190
Thanks for four months, Toon.

1641
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:01,030
Special delivery.

1642
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:04,730
Wait, power?

1643
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:05,230
Power?

1644
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:06,450
Wait, what?

1645
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:08,510
What's...

1646
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:16,850
Shutting the door.

1647
01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:18,690
I shouldn't have slammed it.

1648
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:20,750
Today we're making time capsules.

1649
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:24,630
Please include a letter to your future self and something precious you want to give them.

1650
01:29:25,990 --> 01:29:26,490
Precious.

1651
01:29:27,490 --> 01:29:27,990
Precious.

1652
01:29:29,690 --> 01:29:30,690
Precious kobabaki.

1653
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:35,950
And my baseball.

1654
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:38,050
And the note.

1655
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:41,070
And this funny rabbit.

1656
01:29:43,070 --> 01:29:43,730
For a scare.

1657
01:29:44,650 --> 01:29:45,430
Super Liminal!

1658
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:46,810
Thanks for the 10 gifts.

1659
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:47,830
Thank you so much!

1660
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:49,210
Oh, the note was that?

1661
01:29:49,330 --> 01:29:49,710
The note?

1662
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:50,630
Oh my goodness.

1663
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:51,650
Hi Minky.

1664
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:54,030
First super chat for you and today is my birthday!

1665
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:55,990
Sigma Tom, happy birthday!

1666
01:29:56,610 --> 01:29:58,110
Can I get a Diamond Dog birthday song?

1667
01:29:58,350 --> 01:29:59,390
Of course!

1668
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:02,410
Happy birthday!

1669
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:03,390
Congratulations!

1670
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:08,490
Happy birthday with salutations!

1671
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:10,290
Happy birthday!

1672
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:13,510
May your sky stay blue!

1673
01:30:14,630 --> 01:30:17,790
Happy birthday to you!

1674
01:30:17,890 --> 01:30:19,870
Sigma Tom, happy birthday!

1675
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:20,110
Yay!

1676
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:26,010
I love when sometimes people request the Metal Gear version.

1677
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:28,750
So fun.

1678
01:30:29,230 --> 01:30:30,830
Glad I can sing that for you guys.

1679
01:30:31,170 --> 01:30:31,870
Time capsule!

1680
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:33,930
Second grade class me!

1681
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:37,770
Dear me, hello.

1682
01:30:40,290 --> 01:30:43,270
After growing up, did I become an awesome hero?

1683
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:45,570
Oh, I'm controlling the credits.

1684
01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:48,730
Right now I want to be a pilot or maybe a police officer.

1685
01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:50,170
It's so hard to decide.

1686
01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:54,530
I think it must be really cool to be all grown up and doing whatever you want.

1687
01:30:55,410 --> 01:30:57,790
I put some really special stuff in here.

1688
01:30:58,050 --> 01:30:59,470
Take good care of it please.

1689
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,100
Dear past me, hello.

1690
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:09,620
Do I do it again?

1691
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:11,860
I'm sorry.

1692
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:19,080
I didn't become a pilot or a police officer.

1693
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:23,480
I haven't really accomplished my other dreams either.

1694
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:30,140
I'm just living my life and trying to be considerate.

1695
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:39,700
I mean, being considerate might not sound all that important but...

1696
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:44,320
thinking of others can make the world a slightly nicer place.

1697
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:51,080
That's why even though I grew up like this, part of me still thinks...

1698
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:52,500
maybe I am being a hero.

1699
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:55,660
Yeah, maybe I am.

1700
01:32:01,860 --> 01:32:03,120
Haha, that's so corny.

1701
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:04,840
I'm probably just making excuses.

1702
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:11,480
But if you ever want, I'd love to talk about the good old days again.

1703
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,480
Well, goodnight.

1704
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,160
Number one hundred.

1705
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:33,560
Thank you for covering for me at work today.

1706
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:36,160
You seriously saved my bacon.

1707
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:41,040
You're totally my hero.

1708
01:32:50,610 --> 01:32:51,510
You're welcome.

1709
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:53,250
I received words of gratitude.

1710
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:57,810
In some way or another, considerate.

1711
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:04,000
I'm scared.

1712
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:05,080
You guys, I can't look.

1713
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:05,980
I can't look.

1714
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:13,720
I didn't even...

1715
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,720
I didn't even make it half way.

1716
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,160
Role comprehension is kind of good.

1717
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:21,940
Empathy.

1718
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:23,120
Empathy.

1719
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:24,080
Empathy.

1720
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:25,620
We all need more empathy.

1721
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:28,180
Insight.

1722
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:30,140
Timing is a little...

1723
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:31,380
Thoroughly considerate.

1724
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:32,800
A quick thinking bodyguard.

1725
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:35,080
I'm thoroughly considerate though, you guys.

1726
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:37,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1727
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:41,160
I'm a quick thinking bodyguard.

1728
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:42,720
I'm a bodyguard.

1729
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:45,200
Know how.

1730
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:46,220
Wait, what's the detail?

1731
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:47,180
Oh.

1732
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,360
Considerate fours ranking.

1733
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:56,860
Common sense is disappointing.

1734
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:03,120
Commonly understood social manners and etiquette.

1735
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:06,960
This is the first step in becoming more considerate.

1736
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:12,520
Specialized know how that isn't commonly known.

1737
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:17,520
Having a lot of knowledge is an essential weapon for being more considerate.

1738
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:20,500
Average.

1739
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:21,860
Spatial awareness.

1740
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,600
Sharpness for sense of direction and maintaining the right amount of distance.

1741
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,140
Knowing your place helps in being considerate of others.

1742
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:33,020
Very vaguely considerate.

1743
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:35,040
Group dynamics is good.

1744
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:39,780
The knowledge to understand the role of others expect you to play in a group.

1745
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:43,220
Your cooperative nature leads to smooth teamwork.

1746
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,120
I'm a team player, baby!

1747
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:51,200
Zeonia, thanks for the 7 bucks.

1748
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,680
What do ghosts make for good bodyguards?

1749
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:53,940
Yeah.

1750
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:55,880
Sympathy.

1751
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:57,200
Above average!

1752
01:34:57,780 --> 01:34:58,180
See?

1753
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:01,620
Whether or not you can put yourself in other's shoes and understand how they feel.

1754
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,740
I'm very empathetic everybody.

1755
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:06,860
I'm very empathetic.

1756
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:08,440
I'm empathetic.

1757
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:11,860
I was thinking about this earlier.

1758
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:23,620
I feel that in a lot of cases, the world needs more empathy, more passion, more empathy.

1759
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:32,180
I was just kind of thinking earlier about how there's been a lot of sad news and stuff with Vtubers and everything.

1760
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:41,000
I was just thinking about how a lot of Vtuber fans are quite empathetic, I think.

1761
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:42,600
I think it's actually quite nice.

1762
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:53,120
Even if it's not your Oshi that's graduating, a lot of people will still be like, Don't worry, buddy.

1763
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,680
I'm here for you.

1764
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:56,260
I know it's your Oshi graduating.

1765
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:57,940
Stuff like that.

1766
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:01,460
It's actually quite nice that a lot of people will kind of come together.

1767
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:07,120
And be like, Don't worry, I'm here for you.

1768
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:08,780
Others are here for you.

1769
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:10,240
It's kind of nice.

1770
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:13,320
I was thinking about that earlier.

1771
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:15,900
Adulting.

1772
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,120
Above average.

1773
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:25,120
Ability to step back and take in a situation then assume the roles others don't want to do, allowing everyone to better enjoy themselves.

1774
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:30,000
My information integration is average.

1775
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,800
The power to instantly find the right meaning from fragmented hints with no context.

1776
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:37,160
But sometimes these are a little wild.

1777
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,640
How am I supposed to know what to do with the animals?

1778
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:43,940
Speed.

1779
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:44,880
Average.

1780
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:47,600
The ability to immediately make decisions in any situation.

1781
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:50,260
The speed to understand and react to a situation.

1782
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:51,560
Timing.

1783
01:36:51,660 --> 01:36:51,920
Poor.

1784
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,020
My rhythm is poor.

1785
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:58,420
No, but I...

1786
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:02,180
Talent to following rhythm as instructed.

1787
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:06,580
Being flexible with the ability to go with the flow will be useful in being considerate.

1788
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:10,000
Interval.

1789
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:10,620
Average.

1790
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:12,320
Good and bad intervals.

1791
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:15,680
Why is it that my rhythm is at 29?

1792
01:37:21,010 --> 01:37:25,150
Whether or not you understand the best timing when acting in a series of events.

1793
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:29,690
I... I think I'm good.

1794
01:37:31,130 --> 01:37:31,410
Yeah!

1795
01:37:34,530 --> 01:37:35,030
Secrets?

1796
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:39,010
The past you...

1797
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:41,030
Oh my gosh, the VTuber.

1798
01:37:43,850 --> 01:37:48,010
Oh, this is when, like, you get... Like, that was my stop and...

1799
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:51,570
Like, when I got this little kind of secret achievements.

1800
01:37:52,210 --> 01:37:53,990
Wow, there's one for each thing?

1801
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:55,570
I only got six.

1802
01:37:57,190 --> 01:37:58,150
Holy moly.

1803
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:01,450
Clumsy girl.

1804
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:03,410
Candles too, please.

1805
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:04,370
Wait, what was this one?

1806
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:06,370
I don't remember getting this one.

1807
01:38:07,450 --> 01:38:08,910
Let's see, what are some of the minigames?

1808
01:38:10,770 --> 01:38:11,370
You game.

1809
01:38:12,330 --> 01:38:13,110
Eight yous.

1810
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:16,410
Eight you game.

1811
01:38:16,550 --> 01:38:16,870
Start.

1812
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:27,070
Is this a Suica game?

1813
01:38:27,430 --> 01:38:27,850
Oh no.

1814
01:38:29,050 --> 01:38:30,510
I think this is a Suica game.

1815
01:38:32,730 --> 01:38:33,610
Oh, did you see that?

1816
01:38:33,670 --> 01:38:34,430
Yeah, that one's tiny.

1817
01:38:35,370 --> 01:38:36,170
No way!

1818
01:38:36,650 --> 01:38:37,210
Oh my god.

1819
01:38:38,590 --> 01:38:40,610
And then it's gonna become a big...

1820
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:43,610
Oh my god, no.

1821
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:48,210
We had a Suica game!

1822
01:38:48,650 --> 01:38:50,030
Maybe I can knock this guy over.

1823
01:38:55,790 --> 01:38:57,050
Oh, oh, whoopsie.

1824
01:38:57,150 --> 01:38:58,530
I didn't mean to do that.

1825
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:02,050
Tiny guy.

1826
01:39:05,350 --> 01:39:06,210
Big guy.

1827
01:39:07,290 --> 01:39:08,430
Wow, there's a lot of them.

1828
01:39:10,670 --> 01:39:12,070
Mildly considerate guy.

1829
01:39:18,050 --> 01:39:21,730
No, why are you stuck there?

1830
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:23,430
That's not very considerate of you.

1831
01:39:24,410 --> 01:39:24,930
Yes.

1832
01:39:25,910 --> 01:39:26,430
Yes.

1833
01:39:27,610 --> 01:39:28,130
Yes.

1834
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:30,870
So unsettling without colors.

1835
01:39:31,930 --> 01:39:34,590
It's honestly kind of hard to follow.

1836
01:39:37,190 --> 01:39:38,370
I'm gonna do this one.

1837
01:39:38,950 --> 01:39:40,930
Actually, I guess it doesn't really matter, but...

1838
01:39:40,930 --> 01:39:42,730
We'll do this guy and then they'll combine.

1839
01:39:45,170 --> 01:39:47,090
I've never played Suica game, you guys.

1840
01:39:47,570 --> 01:39:48,530
Should I play Suica game?

1841
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:51,350
Does anybody still play Suica game?

1842
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:52,650
I'll bring back Suica game.

1843
01:39:53,730 --> 01:39:55,030
I'll bring it back.

1844
01:39:58,650 --> 01:39:59,370
Wait, see?

1845
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:00,430
These look like the same.

1846
01:40:01,030 --> 01:40:01,710
But they're not.

1847
01:40:01,810 --> 01:40:04,270
One is just more uncomfortable than the other.

1848
01:40:05,370 --> 01:40:05,730
Oh no.

1849
01:40:06,370 --> 01:40:07,830
Oh no, no, no, no!

1850
01:40:08,030 --> 01:40:08,890
Will it match?

1851
01:40:11,190 --> 01:40:13,430
He's gonna roll over and then into the big...

1852
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:15,290
He's a square!

1853
01:40:17,830 --> 01:40:19,430
How am I supposed to move that?

1854
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:21,850
No way.

1855
01:40:23,630 --> 01:40:24,850
Does he still move?

1856
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:27,410
Okay, he moves, he moves, he moves.

1857
01:40:28,050 --> 01:40:29,010
Oh my gosh.

1858
01:40:30,670 --> 01:40:31,730
He's just a square.

1859
01:40:31,970 --> 01:40:34,470
Be there or be square, literally.

1860
01:40:40,150 --> 01:40:41,870
Guys, do you think I'm considerate?

1861
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:44,890
Maybe this game...

1862
01:40:44,890 --> 01:40:46,330
You know, maybe I do have issues.

1863
01:40:46,830 --> 01:40:47,850
Like I thought.

1864
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:51,370
Maybe I'm antisocial.

1865
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:55,410
Maybe I'm antisocial.

1866
01:40:56,590 --> 01:40:57,490
Oh no!

1867
01:41:02,670 --> 01:41:04,810
Oh god!

1868
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:07,930
Oh no!

1869
01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:11,190
Oh no, I messed up.

1870
01:41:12,970 --> 01:41:13,790
Hit it!

1871
01:41:13,790 --> 01:41:14,490
Tada!

1872
01:41:15,990 --> 01:41:17,110
Oh no.

1873
01:41:18,470 --> 01:41:20,530
Just a little freaky.

1874
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:22,370
I'm a degenerate?

1875
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:23,530
Yeah.

1876
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:26,670
But that's like...

1877
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:28,330
Different than being considerate.

1878
01:41:28,670 --> 01:41:30,030
That's being a degenerate.

1879
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:36,530
Oh no!

1880
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:40,910
No!

1881
01:41:44,330 --> 01:41:45,630
The Blaze!

1882
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:46,810
Welcome to membership!

1883
01:41:47,010 --> 01:41:48,210
Thank you!

1884
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:53,170
Will that hit?

1885
01:41:54,790 --> 01:41:55,650
Nice.

1886
01:42:11,330 --> 01:42:12,690
Touch me!

1887
01:42:13,370 --> 01:42:15,150
I wanna be dirty!

1888
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:18,610
No!

1889
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:19,310
No!

1890
01:42:28,610 --> 01:42:29,910
Quarter of an hour.

1891
01:42:30,170 --> 01:42:30,430
Yeah.

1892
01:42:31,090 --> 01:42:31,970
You guys know that song?

1893
01:42:33,150 --> 01:42:34,070
You guys know that song?

1894
01:42:35,970 --> 01:42:36,370
Right?

1895
01:42:40,470 --> 01:42:40,950
Touch!

1896
01:42:41,970 --> 01:42:42,450
No!

1897
01:42:43,650 --> 01:42:44,130
Sorry.

1898
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:45,710
Oh my god!

1899
01:42:45,810 --> 01:42:46,110
Oh my god!

1900
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:46,390
Oh my god!

1901
01:42:47,010 --> 01:42:48,270
How many sizes is that?

1902
01:42:58,350 --> 01:42:59,310
Octagon looking.

1903
01:43:01,870 --> 01:43:02,350
Nine.

1904
01:43:07,530 --> 01:43:08,990
I think I'm done with this game.

1905
01:43:12,330 --> 01:43:13,870
I kinda wanna get the happy...

1906
01:43:13,870 --> 01:43:15,790
Let's just keep going until I die.

1907
01:43:19,310 --> 01:43:20,950
I'm just gonna play some...

1908
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:22,010
Okay, this is the strat.

1909
01:43:22,110 --> 01:43:23,570
You just place things down...

1910
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:24,690
And they eventually connect.

1911
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:25,550
You know what I mean?

1912
01:43:25,870 --> 01:43:27,670
And then you eventually get something.

1913
01:43:27,950 --> 01:43:29,690
And then you win the game.

1914
01:43:29,690 --> 01:43:30,310
Let's see.

1915
01:43:30,650 --> 01:43:31,650
Spam the U's!

1916
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:32,890
Spam the U's!

1917
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:34,330
Spam the U's!

1918
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:35,750
Spam the U's!

1919
01:43:35,930 --> 01:43:36,550
Spam the U's!

1920
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:49,230
We'll get something eventually.

1921
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:50,170
Maybe.

1922
01:43:50,790 --> 01:43:52,530
Oh no, it's not looking so good you guys.

1923
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:53,770
I don't know.

1924
01:43:55,490 --> 01:43:55,930
Touch!

1925
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:56,210
Touch!

1926
01:43:56,310 --> 01:43:56,490
Touch!

1927
01:43:56,630 --> 01:43:56,830
Touch!

1928
01:43:56,870 --> 01:43:57,290
Touch!

1929
01:43:57,410 --> 01:43:57,530
Touch!

1930
01:43:57,670 --> 01:43:57,810
Touch!

1931
01:43:57,950 --> 01:43:57,950
Touch!

1932
01:43:58,930 --> 01:43:59,470
Touch!

1933
01:43:59,750 --> 01:43:59,750
Touch!

1934
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:00,070
Touch!

1935
01:44:00,230 --> 01:44:00,430
Touch!

1936
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:01,230
Touch!

1937
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:01,550
Touch!

1938
01:44:01,770 --> 01:44:01,930
Touch!

1939
01:44:02,190 --> 01:44:02,210
Touch!

1940
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:02,390
Touch!

1941
01:44:09,070 --> 01:44:11,990
Sorry, it's been a long day for me.

1942
01:44:14,170 --> 01:44:14,990
Busy busy.

1943
01:44:15,390 --> 01:44:18,050
Working on some cool stuff for you guys.

1944
01:44:18,630 --> 01:44:19,410
Cool stuff!

1945
01:44:19,550 --> 01:44:20,290
Cool stuff!

1946
01:44:24,150 --> 01:44:25,210
Oh they're gonna touch!

1947
01:44:25,210 --> 01:44:26,210
They're gonna touch!

1948
01:44:28,830 --> 01:44:30,590
Oh my god, wait.

1949
01:44:32,270 --> 01:44:33,830
Maybe I can get them to touch.

1950
01:44:36,130 --> 01:44:36,710
Touch!

1951
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:38,490
Touch!

1952
01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:40,670
Touch!

1953
01:44:41,390 --> 01:44:42,030
Hey friends!

1954
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:42,750
Nakama!

1955
01:44:43,330 --> 01:44:44,170
Nakama you!

1956
01:44:44,970 --> 01:44:46,750
Oh no, I don't think I can get any closer.

1957
01:44:47,070 --> 01:44:47,630
Maybe this one.

1958
01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:49,410
Down!

1959
01:44:52,990 --> 01:44:54,470
It's so over.

1960
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:01,810
I can't tell what's going on.

1961
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:07,870
Cause every time we touch I get this feeling.

1962
01:45:08,570 --> 01:45:10,390
Every time I...

1963
01:45:10,390 --> 01:45:12,070
Every time I...

1964
01:45:12,970 --> 01:45:14,730
Every time I sleep?

1965
01:45:15,730 --> 01:45:16,210
Wait.

1966
01:45:16,210 --> 01:45:19,870
Cause every time we touch I get this feeling.

1967
01:45:20,170 --> 01:45:22,270
And every time we...

1968
01:45:22,270 --> 01:45:22,850
Sleep?

1969
01:45:23,290 --> 01:45:24,430
What's the next part?

1970
01:45:26,770 --> 01:45:29,110
I swear I can fly.

1971
01:45:33,950 --> 01:45:36,190
I think you answered this before but...

1972
01:45:36,190 --> 01:45:36,870
What's a clarifier?

1973
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:38,950
Are we able to give small gifts at Phantom Thief?

1974
01:45:39,470 --> 01:45:41,950
I wanted to maybe give you a cheque from my event everyone.

1975
01:45:41,950 --> 01:45:42,250
Ah!

1976
01:45:45,150 --> 01:45:48,990
But let me ask first if we have a place for gifts.

1977
01:45:52,090 --> 01:45:53,390
I'll have to ask.

1978
01:45:55,130 --> 01:45:57,070
I think it should be fine.

1979
01:45:59,090 --> 01:46:01,550
And then also if Doki is okay with gifts too.

1980
01:46:01,950 --> 01:46:03,330
I think the website says no.

1981
01:46:04,870 --> 01:46:06,130
I'll double check.

1982
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:08,270
The website says no.

1983
01:46:09,110 --> 01:46:10,490
Then no, I'm sorry.

1984
01:46:10,970 --> 01:46:11,410
Wait!

1985
01:46:11,570 --> 01:46:12,570
That's a different word!

1986
01:46:14,670 --> 01:46:15,630
I'll double check.

1987
01:46:15,690 --> 01:46:17,530
I'll just shoot a message right now.

1988
01:46:28,470 --> 01:46:29,350
I ask.

1989
01:46:30,210 --> 01:46:32,070
I ask, I ask, I ask.

1990
01:46:32,770 --> 01:46:33,430
Hello Mint.

1991
01:46:33,550 --> 01:46:33,890
Hello.

1992
01:46:34,850 --> 01:46:35,290
Hello.

1993
01:46:37,410 --> 01:46:38,330
Hello, hello.

1994
01:46:42,740 --> 01:46:44,060
Did it mean for you to pause the stream?

1995
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:44,720
But it's important!

1996
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:45,560
Okay, yeah.

1997
01:46:45,820 --> 01:46:46,960
I just got an answer.

1998
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,020
We are not... Oh, wait.

1999
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:50,940
We are not accepting gifts.

2000
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:52,920
Unless you want us to.

2001
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:53,880
Oh, wait.

2002
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:59,840
It's also up to Doki too though, you know?

2003
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:03,500
Two weeks ago I watched zero Vtubers.

2004
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:04,480
Now I watch one.

2005
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:08,120
And have 96 out of 97 achievements in Holocure.

2006
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:11,020
Wait.

2007
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:12,920
Which one do you watch?

2008
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:15,200
Who's the one?

2009
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:16,980
Fine, don't blame me.

2010
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:17,940
I've been super tired.

2011
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:23,260
How did you get so many achievements in such a short amount of time?

2012
01:47:24,100 --> 01:47:26,500
But I haven't even got that many.

2013
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:27,440
Oh my gosh.

2014
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,960
No, it might not be me though.

2015
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:43,300
It could be someone in Hololive.

2016
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:46,740
Because they play Holocure.

2017
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:50,060
It's Doki.

2018
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:51,640
See?

2019
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:52,720
It's not even me.

2020
01:47:53,620 --> 01:47:55,120
You guys all get...

2021
01:47:55,120 --> 01:47:56,280
You guys get...

2022
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:57,480
Oh my gosh!

2023
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:58,160
No!

2024
01:47:58,680 --> 01:47:59,980
I thought I was about to die!

2025
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:01,260
This sleepy man!

2026
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:02,180
Get out of here!

2027
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:04,580
Poison him in his sleep!

2028
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,020
Then I'll have to leave.

2029
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:08,140
Oh my gosh.

2030
01:48:20,210 --> 01:48:21,010
Oh!

2031
01:48:21,290 --> 01:48:27,170
They said that!

2032
01:48:27,650 --> 01:48:31,030
It might be difficult for people bringing gifts...

2033
01:48:31,030 --> 01:48:33,210
through like security or whatever.

2034
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:45,610
Minto not a VTuber?

2035
01:48:45,690 --> 01:48:46,630
I never said that!

2036
01:48:48,170 --> 01:48:49,110
I'm VTuber!

2037
01:48:49,490 --> 01:48:49,730
Oh!

2038
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:53,830
I think today is the last day to vote for Lady VTuber.

2039
01:48:54,670 --> 01:48:55,430
If you...

2040
01:48:55,430 --> 01:48:56,610
Oh!

2041
01:48:56,830 --> 01:48:58,170
We got a regular guy!

2042
01:48:59,210 --> 01:49:00,450
Oh my god!

2043
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:02,110
He's so regular!

2044
01:49:02,770 --> 01:49:03,090
Yeah!

2045
01:49:09,110 --> 01:49:12,110
Taking time to message Vanity on the spot to answer a fan's question.

2046
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:13,810
Truly the most considerate ghostman.

2047
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:14,550
Also hi!

2048
01:49:14,610 --> 01:49:15,950
This is my first ever Super Chat to you!

2049
01:49:16,750 --> 01:49:17,230
Das!

2050
01:49:18,230 --> 01:49:19,010
Thank you!

2051
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:20,490
Thanks for the Super Chat!

2052
01:49:22,090 --> 01:49:22,670
Thank you!

2053
01:49:24,810 --> 01:49:26,470
Just a regular old guy.

2054
01:49:26,570 --> 01:49:27,310
A regular Joe.

2055
01:49:27,990 --> 01:49:31,350
He takes his coffee with one cream and one sugar.

2056
01:49:32,350 --> 01:49:33,730
Most average guy.

2057
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:35,770
I'll vote for you anyway.

2058
01:49:35,890 --> 01:49:36,310
Good luck!

2059
01:49:37,010 --> 01:49:37,770
Thanks!

2060
01:49:38,330 --> 01:49:42,350
Yeah, if you want to see me maybe as a Lady VTuber...

2061
01:49:43,810 --> 01:49:46,350
in the VTuber Awards...

2062
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:48,350
I was nominated...

2063
01:49:49,110 --> 01:49:51,950
alongside some other great VTubers.

2064
01:49:52,650 --> 01:49:54,730
Like Kiara Takanashi!

2065
01:49:58,410 --> 01:49:59,750
Lady VTuber.

2066
01:50:02,870 --> 01:50:03,910
You voted for me?

2067
01:50:04,110 --> 01:50:04,910
Thank you!

2068
01:50:05,210 --> 01:50:06,270
Are you a Lady VTuber?

2069
01:50:06,890 --> 01:50:08,170
I'm a lady, yeah.

2070
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:10,870
I'm a little lady.

2071
01:50:16,850 --> 01:50:18,350
You could say that.

2072
01:50:18,990 --> 01:50:20,350
You could say I'm a little lady.

2073
01:50:21,250 --> 01:50:22,150
You could say that.

2074
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:26,350
Guys, I don't know if we're going to get to the happiest guy.

2075
01:50:26,810 --> 01:50:30,830
I don't know if we're ever going to get to the happiest guy, but we got to regular guy.

2076
01:50:30,950 --> 01:50:32,310
Honestly, I feel like that's a win.

2077
01:50:34,150 --> 01:50:36,330
Oh my gosh, these look so similar!

2078
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:37,990
Tiny lady.

2079
01:50:39,370 --> 01:50:40,270
I'll vote it for you.

2080
01:50:42,410 --> 01:50:43,190
Scan the gifts.

2081
01:50:44,570 --> 01:50:45,150
Thank you!

2082
01:50:45,290 --> 01:50:46,270
I don't think we'll...

2083
01:50:46,270 --> 01:50:47,830
I don't know if we'll be doing the gifts though.

2084
01:50:50,530 --> 01:50:52,190
I don't know.

2085
01:50:54,550 --> 01:50:57,870
But whenever I get gifts I always check them.

2086
01:51:00,550 --> 01:51:01,450
I do check.

2087
01:51:01,630 --> 01:51:02,050
I do check.

2088
01:51:02,210 --> 01:51:02,570
Oh no!

2089
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:06,050
Wait, what happens if I go outside?

2090
01:51:08,270 --> 01:51:10,110
Wait, can I combine with like this?

2091
01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:10,970
What if?

2092
01:51:18,350 --> 01:51:18,790
No!

2093
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:33,560
I feel like this is the type of...

2094
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:36,400
Oh, because it's like Suika game, but it's U game.

2095
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:37,500
That's so funny.

2096
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:41,160
I feel like this would be the type of game to troll you with that, you know?

2097
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:43,460
What is this one?

2098
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:44,920
Eight U's.

2099
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,600
What is going on here?

2100
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:47,720
Oh no!

2101
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:50,420
It's Exit 8, but it's Ohmaiwa 8!

2102
01:51:50,420 --> 01:51:53,800
Look closely at all 8 U's.

2103
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:55,540
If all 8 are the same, go forward.

2104
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:57,240
If one is different, criticize them.

2105
01:51:57,560 --> 01:51:59,160
Pass through 8 cars to get out.

2106
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:00,920
This is so fun!

2107
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:03,020
I even mentioned Exit 8 earlier.

2108
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:09,720
Oh!

2109
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:11,560
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

2110
01:52:11,640 --> 01:52:12,060
It's not...

2111
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:15,880
Okay, smartphones, smartphones, smartphones...

2112
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:17,640
We go back.

2113
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,100
Oh wait, we have to criticize them.

2114
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:24,860
Now I remember that Minto's common sense score was low.

2115
01:52:24,940 --> 01:52:26,120
What are you talking about?

2116
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:29,220
Oh, smack!

2117
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:31,320
That's right.

2118
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:33,620
Car 2.

2119
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:34,980
We criticize them.

2120
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:38,740
I didn't think criticizing was going to be so violent.

2121
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:39,800
Hey!

2122
01:52:40,700 --> 01:52:41,480
Criticize!

2123
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:46,020
Criticize!

2124
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:47,000
Criticize!

2125
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:50,020
Oh my god, the rapids in the back.

2126
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:51,000
This is kind of scary.

2127
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:55,660
They all look the same.

2128
01:53:00,170 --> 01:53:01,150
I think we're good.

2129
01:53:03,450 --> 01:53:04,210
Car 4.

2130
01:53:07,170 --> 01:53:07,950
Fallen... Oh!

2131
01:53:08,550 --> 01:53:08,990
Criticize!

2132
01:53:11,370 --> 01:53:12,250
Car 5.

2133
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:20,600
No ass, no ass, no ass, no ass, no ass, no ass...

2134
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:25,040
They all have the same face.

2135
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:27,560
They're all holding with the same hand.

2136
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:28,400
Next car.

2137
01:53:29,660 --> 01:53:31,860
They might crit his eyes when you bonk him.

2138
01:53:42,260 --> 01:53:43,260
Car 7.

2139
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:52,760
He was like, he was expecting to get his ass slapped.

2140
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:55,700
He was just like...

2141
01:53:56,860 --> 01:53:57,760
Wait a second.

2142
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:02,240
Wait, how do I know?

2143
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:10,180
Is it this guy?

2144
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:17,100
Because this one is holding on to the first handle and this guy is holding on to the third hand.

2145
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:31,120
What if I go?

2146
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:45,020
Wow, cleared 8 U's and fun mini-games.

2147
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:52,500
Hey Minto, are we able to leave gifts for you at the...

2148
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:56,380
Kira, go.

2149
01:54:56,700 --> 01:54:57,460
Get out of here.

2150
01:54:58,920 --> 01:54:59,860
Go away!

2151
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:03,200
Jump U.

2152
01:55:05,820 --> 01:55:06,880
No, no, wait.

2153
01:55:06,940 --> 01:55:07,920
This is just Jump King.

2154
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:11,100
Oh my god, as soon as it said Jump U, I was like, wait, wait.

2155
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:12,360
I think I know this.

2156
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:17,640
Oh no, no, no, no.

2157
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:21,280
Why does every game have to have a Jump King now?

2158
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:25,700
Why does everything have to have a Jump King now?

2159
01:55:26,380 --> 01:55:27,540
Why every game?

2160
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:31,100
This one is even worse because it's so slow.

2161
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:35,080
Are those supposed to be crickets?

2162
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:41,160
Oh my god, it's so slow.

2163
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:42,860
Yeah, it's painfully slow.

2164
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:52,660
I feel like I'm jumping in zero G's.

2165
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:03,740
Oh my god, oh my god.

2166
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:05,640
Okay, I can't do this, no.

2167
01:56:06,140 --> 01:56:06,540
Get me out.

2168
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,000
Get me meowt.

2169
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:09,440
Get me out.

2170
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:10,520
Get me out of the game, please.

2171
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:12,260
How do I stop the game?

2172
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:13,760
How do I stop the game?

2173
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:16,740
Yes, stop playing the game.

2174
01:56:21,020 --> 01:56:22,100
Get me meowt.

2175
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,740
If I say consider it together...

2176
01:56:26,060 --> 01:56:26,980
Oh, never mind.

2177
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:28,180
I don't have a player 2.

2178
01:56:29,260 --> 01:56:30,140
Quick consider it.

2179
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:30,640
Let's try this.

2180
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:31,940
Wait, wait.

2181
01:56:32,780 --> 01:56:33,280
Hold on.

2182
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:34,600
Go back, go back.

2183
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:35,800
Okay, wait.

2184
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:38,720
We can do the quick one and then I want to do the inconsiderate.

2185
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:42,740
As a test run, we'll measure your consideration skills with 10 questions.

2186
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:44,100
They're all rather easy.

2187
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:47,300
This is a space where you are free to consider things as you like.

2188
01:56:47,540 --> 01:56:50,740
There is no one here to stop you from being as considerate as you please.

2189
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:54,640
After considering the situation, move the red object.

2190
01:56:54,780 --> 01:56:55,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2191
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:55,320
Okay.

2192
01:56:56,240 --> 01:56:56,720
Number 1.

2193
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:57,720
This is quick mode guys.

2194
01:56:57,800 --> 01:56:58,220
Quick mode.

2195
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:02,440
Oh.

2196
01:57:05,110 --> 01:57:06,210
I can't move.

2197
01:57:09,130 --> 01:57:10,090
You're welcome.

2198
01:57:11,570 --> 01:57:12,150
Okay.

2199
01:57:12,570 --> 01:57:13,790
We did this one before though.

2200
01:57:14,350 --> 01:57:14,810
Number 2.

2201
01:57:16,690 --> 01:57:18,750
Oh, we did this one too.

2202
01:57:19,230 --> 01:57:19,790
Let's leave.

2203
01:57:20,510 --> 01:57:21,730
These are the ones we've done before.

2204
01:57:24,590 --> 01:57:25,790
Inconsiderate mode.

2205
01:57:26,530 --> 01:57:27,370
You're welcome.

2206
01:57:29,730 --> 01:57:32,530
This is a space where you can freely mess around.

2207
01:57:32,630 --> 01:57:33,790
No one is going to hold you back.

2208
01:57:34,050 --> 01:57:35,950
Go ahead and mess around to your heart's content.

2209
01:57:38,150 --> 01:57:40,830
Please be inconsiderate and mess around.

2210
01:57:41,050 --> 01:57:41,970
There is no explanation.

2211
01:57:42,290 --> 01:57:43,490
Just go nuts.

2212
01:57:46,870 --> 01:57:49,430
Let's watch the first sunrise of the new year.

2213
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:58,980
The sun rose.

2214
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,200
Oh yeah.

2215
01:58:07,660 --> 01:58:09,060
Oh yeah little pear.

2216
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:10,960
Oh you're two peas in a pod.

2217
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:12,900
You're a little pear pear.

2218
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:26,820
How do they like that?

2219
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:29,000
How do they like that?

2220
01:58:29,860 --> 01:58:31,100
How do they like that?

2221
01:58:32,140 --> 01:58:33,320
You think they like that?

2222
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:38,000
Why is my Oshi such a freak?

2223
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:39,600
This is inconsiderate mode!

2224
01:58:50,780 --> 01:58:51,660
Let me

2225
01:58:55,620 --> 01:58:55,800
in.

2226
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:56,940
Please let me in, please.

2227
01:58:58,440 --> 01:59:00,400
I just stepped out for a second.

2228
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:02,140
Please let me in, please.

2229
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:07,920
Number 4.

2230
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:10,720
It's finally my turn.

2231
01:59:13,220 --> 01:59:16,360
It says sit wherever I... Actually I want to sit next to the pretty lady.

2232
01:59:16,860 --> 01:59:18,220
Maybe I should have gone to the toilet.

2233
01:59:19,820 --> 01:59:20,860
Just like in school.

2234
01:59:30,340 --> 01:59:31,340
Into the cup.

2235
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:40,940
Put it in my drink.

2236
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:41,740
Put it in my drink.

2237
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:44,560
Nasty.

2238
01:59:45,780 --> 01:59:46,580
Bacon?

2239
01:59:46,860 --> 01:59:48,280
No, I think it's like pickled ginger.

2240
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:51,900
Moderately...bulk.

2241
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:00,240
Bokeh?

2242
02:00:00,240 --> 02:00:01,040
Like...Bokeh?

2243
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:04,520
Bokeh?

2244
02:00:05,540 --> 02:00:07,400
It's cherry blossom season.

2245
02:00:13,910 --> 02:00:15,870
What if I went all the way though?

2246
02:00:15,870 --> 02:00:16,970
I'm going!

2247
02:00:22,780 --> 02:00:26,000
Bokeh is kind of like an airhead, I guess.

2248
02:00:33,830 --> 02:00:35,950
That's what the achievement I just got was.

2249
02:00:38,330 --> 02:00:38,930
Bokeh.

2250
02:00:39,350 --> 02:00:40,150
I'm a little stupid.

2251
02:00:40,650 --> 02:00:41,450
A little airhead-ish.

2252
02:01:00,030 --> 02:01:00,890
Number 8.

2253
02:01:00,950 --> 02:01:01,790
I'll go to number 10.

2254
02:01:04,630 --> 02:01:05,510
Excuse me.

2255
02:01:07,290 --> 02:01:07,890
Gosh.

2256
02:01:08,050 --> 02:01:08,530
Sorry.

2257
02:01:10,850 --> 02:01:11,290
Sorry.

2258
02:01:11,890 --> 02:01:12,330
Sorry.

2259
02:01:12,930 --> 02:01:13,370
Sorry.

2260
02:01:13,930 --> 02:01:14,310
Sorry.

2261
02:01:15,450 --> 02:01:17,910
It must be fate that we have collided into each other.

2262
02:01:18,410 --> 02:01:19,690
We collided into each other.

2263
02:01:19,770 --> 02:01:20,430
Oh, you dropped your wallet.

2264
02:01:20,890 --> 02:01:21,910
I'm not stealing it.

2265
02:01:21,970 --> 02:01:22,790
I'm picking it up for you.

2266
02:01:23,070 --> 02:01:24,130
Oh, pretty fair maiden.

2267
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:26,770
It must be fate that we have collided today like this.

2268
02:01:26,930 --> 02:01:30,950
It's fate that we have met under these circumstances.

2269
02:01:31,430 --> 02:01:33,410
Isn't this just like your favorite rom-com?

2270
02:01:33,410 --> 02:01:34,870
Rom-com!

2271
02:01:36,770 --> 02:01:39,490
You reach down and you try to grab their wallet...

2272
02:01:39,490 --> 02:01:41,930
but you aren't stealing it, but you're trying to grab it to give it back to them, and then...

2273
02:01:41,930 --> 02:01:42,770
your hands touch.

2274
02:01:47,780 --> 02:01:48,720
Oh my god.

2275
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:49,560
Oh my god.

2276
02:01:49,620 --> 02:01:50,120
Oh my god.

2277
02:01:50,220 --> 02:01:51,020
Oh my god.

2278
02:01:51,220 --> 02:01:51,800
Oh my god.

2279
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:52,100
Oh my god.

2280
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:52,360
Oh my god.

2281
02:01:52,620 --> 02:01:53,120
Oh my god.

2282
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:53,340
Oh my god.

2283
02:01:53,660 --> 02:01:54,360
Oh my god.

2284
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:55,480
Oh my god.

2285
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:56,860
How embarrassing for you.

2286
02:01:57,180 --> 02:01:58,620
This is so embarrassing for you.

2287
02:01:59,060 --> 02:01:59,900
Oh my god.

2288
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:01,340
This is so embarrassing for you.

2289
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:02,720
This is horrible.

2290
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:05,620
This is the worst thing that could actually happen to you.

2291
02:02:07,740 --> 02:02:09,000
Sorry, that was mean.

2292
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:12,860
Embarrassing, embarrassing, embarrassing.

2293
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:16,680
Gliding 3 times could be a coincidence, but 16 times?

2294
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:17,620
That's fate.

2295
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:18,740
It's true.

2296
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:21,860
My treat, so pick whatever looks good.

2297
02:02:25,480 --> 02:02:26,940
I'm eating for 21.

2298
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:28,900
Blackjack!

2299
02:02:34,540 --> 02:02:36,260
Middle-aged charmer.

2300
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:37,860
Huh?

2301
02:02:38,940 --> 02:02:40,540
In some way or another.

2302
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:42,120
Bokeh.

2303
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:47,400
Fuck, look at all these guys.

2304
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:53,440
Okay, how do I get out?

2305
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:55,760
Game, let me be free.

2306
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:58,420
Stop playing.

2307
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:03,700
This is so silly.

2308
02:03:04,900 --> 02:03:06,480
I like Kukiyomi.

2309
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:10,900
Even though I don't think I can always...

2310
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:12,720
Sometimes I can't read it.

2311
02:03:19,180 --> 02:03:20,260
It's very unique.

2312
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:23,540
It's fun because also it's just so...

2313
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:25,080
Some of these things are just so Japanese.

2314
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:28,500
You know?

2315
02:03:37,310 --> 02:03:41,750
I don't know how to tell you this, but...

2316
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:44,110
Burger was just onigiri that's messier to eat.

2317
02:03:48,030 --> 02:03:48,510
What?

2318
02:03:48,750 --> 02:03:49,150
No!

2319
02:03:52,170 --> 02:03:53,130
Onigiri has...

2320
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:54,910
Onigiri has...

2321
02:03:57,130 --> 02:03:58,490
Onigiri has nori.

2322
02:03:58,650 --> 02:03:59,570
This is not nori.

2323
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:05,420
Phantom Sha!

2324
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:06,720
Welcome to my voice chat.

2325
02:04:06,740 --> 02:04:07,200
Thank you!

2326
02:04:07,860 --> 02:04:09,360
I'm gonna head over to...

2327
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:09,940
Give me a second.

2328
02:04:11,100 --> 02:04:12,720
We're gonna head over to my maid cafe.

2329
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:13,340
It's been a minute.

2330
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:16,280
It's been a minute.

2331
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:17,180
Oh, wait.

2332
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:17,700
Oh, yeah.

2333
02:04:17,780 --> 02:04:18,440
We're good, I think.

2334
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:19,440
I think?

2335
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:20,660
I think.

2336
02:04:20,860 --> 02:04:21,100
Sorry.

2337
02:04:21,220 --> 02:04:23,060
Some things have been kind of kooky on my computer.

2338
02:04:25,180 --> 02:04:27,400
My computer has been a little wackadoodle lately.

2339
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:30,960
Yeah!

2340
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:34,060
One second, let's put on some...

2341
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:35,960
Some music.

2342
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:37,300
Some ongaku.

2343
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:42,860
I'll treat you to music until we get...

2344
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:49,520
La la la la la la la la la la.

2345
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:50,880
Misato!

2346
02:04:51,180 --> 02:04:52,000
Thanks for the tag after!

2347
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:53,760
Thank you!

2348
02:04:54,420 --> 02:04:55,680
We'll do this one, it's been a minute.

2349
02:05:05,810 --> 02:05:06,290
Yeah.

2350
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:09,990
We were considerate today, everybody.

2351
02:05:13,730 --> 02:05:15,130
Thanks for a considerate stream.

2352
02:05:15,430 --> 02:05:17,070
Hope you get a good rest after all that recording.

2353
02:05:19,930 --> 02:05:22,630
Yeah, I can't wait for you guys to see.

2354
02:05:27,930 --> 02:05:31,950
Busy busy recently, because it's been like recording for other stuff.

2355
02:05:32,870 --> 02:05:36,210
Then also getting ready for the concert.

2356
02:05:36,990 --> 02:05:38,330
Ducky, thanks for the 5 gifted!

2357
02:05:43,170 --> 02:05:44,190
It's just been...

2358
02:05:44,190 --> 02:05:46,030
Was it for the concert or something else?

2359
02:05:46,070 --> 02:05:47,350
Something else.

2360
02:05:50,550 --> 02:05:52,430
Whatever could it be?

2361
02:05:54,930 --> 02:05:58,070
But you know, obviously busy is good.

2362
02:05:58,830 --> 02:06:00,570
Because it's good stuff.

2363
02:06:00,730 --> 02:06:02,350
It's just busy busy.

2364
02:06:08,170 --> 02:06:09,970
3 hours of something else.

2365
02:06:16,310 --> 02:06:19,410
And then... I can't speak.

2366
02:06:20,090 --> 02:06:22,750
There's been a lot going on behind the scenes too, so...

2367
02:06:23,810 --> 02:06:26,470
I mean, that's generally how it is, right?

2368
02:06:27,230 --> 02:06:29,990
I feel... Well, I was gonna say it's been kind of slow.

2369
02:06:30,930 --> 02:06:31,910
But maybe not.

2370
02:06:35,390 --> 02:06:36,630
You know, have the concert?

2371
02:06:37,370 --> 02:06:39,010
I think maybe in terms of announcements.

2372
02:06:40,170 --> 02:06:40,790
I don't know.

2373
02:06:44,050 --> 02:06:44,690
I don't know.

2374
02:06:44,690 --> 02:06:45,030
Solaris!

2375
02:06:45,110 --> 02:06:45,910
Welcome to the membo show!

2376
02:06:46,230 --> 02:06:48,330
Thank you for the 7 months!

2377
02:06:48,690 --> 02:06:51,510
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

2378
02:06:53,390 --> 02:06:54,950
I don't know.

2379
02:06:57,870 --> 02:06:59,870
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

2380
02:07:03,030 --> 02:07:04,030
Let's go, Minto.

2381
02:07:05,770 --> 02:07:07,670
What are you thinking for 300k?

2382
02:07:07,670 --> 02:07:09,850
I don't know.

2383
02:07:12,230 --> 02:07:20,410
Or rather, I think why I say it feels kind of slow is because a lot of stuff I'm working on is not to be known for quite some time.

2384
02:07:21,890 --> 02:07:23,830
So, you know.

2385
02:07:24,150 --> 02:07:27,010
Feels slow in terms of the right now.

2386
02:07:27,870 --> 02:07:29,670
But lots working on.

2387
02:07:39,130 --> 02:07:40,270
That's all you have to say?

2388
02:07:45,370 --> 02:07:49,170
What was I gonna say?

2389
02:07:50,570 --> 02:07:51,370
Oh, 300k.

2390
02:07:51,690 --> 02:07:52,550
I don't know.

2391
02:07:53,910 --> 02:07:55,190
What should we do, guys?

2392
02:07:55,530 --> 02:08:00,090
It was my goal for the end of the year, but I wasn't sure if I was gonna make it so I didn't think about it.

2393
02:08:02,250 --> 02:08:03,710
I didn't think about it.

2394
02:08:09,290 --> 02:08:11,690
Eat the second donut for 300k.

2395
02:08:11,830 --> 02:08:13,130
It'll be bad by then.

2396
02:08:16,790 --> 02:08:18,490
Go to Antarctica.

2397
02:08:18,810 --> 02:08:19,410
I wish.

2398
02:08:20,050 --> 02:08:20,710
Who's cuter?

2399
02:08:21,770 --> 02:08:22,590
Katelyn or Snake?

2400
02:08:24,170 --> 02:08:24,770
Katelyn.

2401
02:08:24,910 --> 02:08:25,810
Katelyn is so cute.

2402
02:08:26,630 --> 02:08:29,890
Snake is cute, but like in a different way.

2403
02:08:30,350 --> 02:08:32,790
But Katelyn is like just...

2404
02:08:32,790 --> 02:08:35,150
It makes my heart ache when I think of it.

2405
02:08:35,150 --> 02:08:37,430
When I think of...

2406
02:08:40,010 --> 02:08:46,530
When I think of Katelyn, the tears just immediately come into my eyes.

2407
02:08:50,370 --> 02:08:52,010
It's just so cute.

2408
02:08:54,730 --> 02:08:55,950
It's so cute.

2409
02:08:58,350 --> 02:09:00,530
You got one guy in the crying.

2410
02:09:01,890 --> 02:09:02,870
Snake is not cute though.

2411
02:09:02,890 --> 02:09:03,570
What are you talking about?

2412
02:09:03,570 --> 02:09:05,230
Anything can be cute.

2413
02:09:05,590 --> 02:09:06,870
It's all about perspective.

2414
02:09:09,530 --> 02:09:10,730
It's all about perspective.

2415
02:09:11,330 --> 02:09:14,390
It's about finding the things, like the little things that someone does.

2416
02:09:15,070 --> 02:09:15,990
Or something does.

2417
02:09:16,490 --> 02:09:18,210
That's why people can like look at a robot.

2418
02:09:18,330 --> 02:09:19,470
You know those robot dogs?

2419
02:09:20,190 --> 02:09:23,910
That like people push over and they like stumble and it's just like...

2420
02:09:23,910 --> 02:09:24,950
How cute.

2421
02:09:25,370 --> 02:09:26,750
Oh wait, I forgot to exit out the game.

2422
02:09:27,210 --> 02:09:32,310
The perspective is cute.

2423
02:09:32,310 --> 02:09:35,290
The way Snake repeats things is very cute.

2424
02:09:36,290 --> 02:09:38,430
Is Kate Sith a Vtuber?

2425
02:09:38,930 --> 02:09:39,190
No!

2426
02:09:39,930 --> 02:09:41,610
No, because...

2427
02:09:41,610 --> 02:09:43,590
Because he's not digital.

2428
02:09:45,330 --> 02:09:46,670
He's like a toy.

2429
02:09:50,190 --> 02:09:50,870
I'll set you.

2430
02:09:50,990 --> 02:09:51,810
You are cute, Minto.

2431
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:55,530
Only because my mama made me this way.

2432
02:09:55,530 --> 02:10:02,430
I don't think I ever put Kaitlin in my party in the original game.

2433
02:10:02,750 --> 02:10:04,390
He's alright in the remake.

2434
02:10:04,750 --> 02:10:05,990
He's so cute though.

2435
02:10:07,090 --> 02:10:08,850
Every moment he's around, I feel better.

2436
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:13,710
Snake is cute indeed, but not as cute as JPEG dog.

2437
02:10:15,990 --> 02:10:17,630
Minto is extra cute today.

2438
02:10:20,590 --> 02:10:21,510
Just kidding.

2439
02:10:23,450 --> 02:10:25,730
I think those robot dogs are cute for real.

2440
02:10:25,790 --> 02:10:26,270
They are.

2441
02:10:26,750 --> 02:10:31,850
What's something that people don't really typically consider cute, but is very cute?

2442
02:10:36,070 --> 02:10:39,990
The way you're so intensely moved by your affection for things, that's cute.

2443
02:10:41,070 --> 02:10:41,910
That's a weakness.

2444
02:10:42,950 --> 02:10:44,130
Cute is a state of being.

2445
02:10:44,490 --> 02:10:45,870
Like being a cute ghost.

2446
02:10:48,430 --> 02:10:50,830
You bought Ace Combat 7 because of my tweet?

2447
02:10:51,010 --> 02:10:51,350
Good.

2448
02:10:51,990 --> 02:10:52,590
Ghosts?

2449
02:10:52,690 --> 02:10:53,050
No!

2450
02:10:53,250 --> 02:10:54,130
Ghosts are so cute!

2451
02:10:54,530 --> 02:10:55,670
Snakes are so cute!

2452
02:10:56,170 --> 02:10:57,670
Octopus are so cute!

2453
02:10:58,590 --> 02:11:00,170
What are you talking about?

2454
02:11:01,430 --> 02:11:02,030
Quasimodo.

2455
02:11:05,310 --> 02:11:06,730
This poor guy.

2456
02:11:08,210 --> 02:11:10,110
My birthday was yesterday!

2457
02:11:10,630 --> 02:11:11,350
Can I get a happy birthday?

2458
02:11:11,570 --> 02:11:12,330
Of course, boo!

2459
02:11:13,330 --> 02:11:16,910
Happy birthday to you!

2460
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:20,030
Happy birthday to you!

2461
02:11:20,470 --> 02:11:23,310
Happy birthday dear Blue!

2462
02:11:24,610 --> 02:11:29,150
Happy birthday to you!

2463
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:38,600
What happened in March?

2464
02:11:44,220 --> 02:11:45,760
Valentine's day was February.

2465
02:11:49,740 --> 02:11:51,860
So excited for new players to jump into my series.

2466
02:11:53,900 --> 02:11:55,040
Nine, you're so funny.

2467
02:11:58,340 --> 02:12:01,120
There was something you tweeted the other day.

2468
02:12:01,660 --> 02:12:04,120
It was like a reply to one of my tweets, so I saw it.

2469
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:05,540
It just made me laugh.

2470
02:12:08,920 --> 02:12:09,880
Rika-chan!

2471
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:11,260
Thank you for the 5 gifted!

2472
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:15,820
If anybody thinks that I am so into Metal Gear...

2473
02:12:15,820 --> 02:12:18,180
They don't know how much Nine is into Ace Combat.

2474
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:21,880
I need to get on your level.

2475
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:29,020
That's so funny.

2476
02:12:29,940 --> 02:12:30,760
I love it.

2477
02:12:32,980 --> 02:12:33,540
True.

2478
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:39,800
He's always messaging us about it.

2479
02:12:39,820 --> 02:12:40,600
What do you mean?

2480
02:12:42,860 --> 02:12:44,260
We celebrate Brain Rot.

2481
02:12:44,340 --> 02:12:45,040
Yeah, we do.

2482
02:12:45,660 --> 02:12:46,440
Yes, we do.

2483
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:49,820
Because we love Brain Rot here.

2484
02:12:50,660 --> 02:12:52,400
Sometimes I didn't know I was funny though.

2485
02:12:52,540 --> 02:12:53,700
Yeah, you're so funny!

2486
02:12:53,780 --> 02:12:54,840
What are you talking about?

2487
02:12:57,560 --> 02:12:58,500
You're so funny.

2488
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:01,640
I think you guys are hilarious, honestly.

2489
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:05,740
I feel like you guys make me laugh more than I make you guys laugh.

2490
02:13:06,220 --> 02:13:08,420
I feel like you guys are always making me laugh.

2491
02:13:09,940 --> 02:13:10,740
You guys are so funny.

2492
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:11,220
No you?

2493
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:11,860
No you.

2494
02:13:16,740 --> 02:13:17,920
That's not true.

2495
02:13:18,140 --> 02:13:19,120
It is true!

2496
02:13:20,220 --> 02:13:22,120
You guys have such funny comments.

2497
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:24,380
I'm always laughing.

2498
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:26,200
I'm glad we have Flynn.

2499
02:13:26,760 --> 02:13:27,360
It's reciprocal.

2500
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:29,060
It's reciprocal.

2501
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:32,140
You too?

2502
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:37,420
Who, me?

2503
02:13:37,700 --> 02:13:38,380
Yes, you.

2504
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:44,280
I'm sure a few of us are funny, but I don't know about me.

2505
02:13:44,980 --> 02:13:46,280
I think you guys are all funny.

2506
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:53,840
If you could hear us laughing, you'd probably go insane.

2507
02:13:54,100 --> 02:13:54,880
Oh my gosh.

2508
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:59,200
I did a Patreon stream the other day, right?

2509
02:14:01,240 --> 02:14:06,680
Because I'm still behind on streams for the Patreon from the podcast.

2510
02:14:06,980 --> 02:14:07,800
Because I suck.

2511
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:12,360
I accidentally made a 32 person lobby.

2512
02:14:13,940 --> 02:14:14,960
And it was just chaos.

2513
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:17,380
I was just hearing everybody at once.

2514
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:20,820
It was just everything.

2515
02:14:22,140 --> 02:14:23,640
If it makes you laugh, then I'm glad.

2516
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:25,700
Anyways, Ace commenting this.

2517
02:14:31,660 --> 02:14:33,180
Funny looking, maybe.

2518
02:14:39,340 --> 02:14:41,800
I literally have met you, David.

2519
02:14:43,720 --> 02:14:44,920
At Vmuse.

2520
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:48,480
We literally... I literally know what you look like.

2521
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:50,880
I saw pictures of you on Twitter.

2522
02:14:56,850 --> 02:14:57,530
Literally.

2523
02:14:57,530 --> 02:14:58,210
Literally.

2524
02:15:00,830 --> 02:15:01,990
I'm in danger.

2525
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:09,980
I've met some of you guys.

2526
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:12,060
I have.

2527
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:15,200
And for those who I haven't met yet, I will.

2528
02:15:16,720 --> 02:15:17,960
I will.

2529
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:18,940
I will.

2530
02:15:25,220 --> 02:15:26,420
Good luck.

2531
02:15:29,540 --> 02:15:30,300
One day or another.

2532
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:33,100
Not if I don't leave my house.

2533
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:34,900
Why do you think you're safe?

2534
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:36,940
Why do you think you're safe then?

2535
02:15:37,160 --> 02:15:37,780
I'm a ghost.

2536
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:39,460
I can literally go into your walls.

2537
02:15:44,150 --> 02:15:46,130
But then, isn't that good if I go into your walls?

2538
02:15:46,370 --> 02:15:48,710
Like someone asked earlier if I...

2539
02:15:48,710 --> 02:15:50,070
If I...

2540
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:52,630
If I...

2541
02:15:53,730 --> 02:15:56,030
If I saw their water problem.

2542
02:15:56,290 --> 02:15:57,530
And I said no.

2543
02:15:57,530 --> 02:16:00,450
And I could figure out your electricity too.

2544
02:16:02,810 --> 02:16:04,490
I'm putting salt in my walls.

2545
02:16:04,710 --> 02:16:04,930
No!

2546
02:16:06,090 --> 02:16:07,290
Please don't!

2547
02:16:08,310 --> 02:16:09,370
Let me stay there.

2548
02:16:10,310 --> 02:16:13,290
It's like when you let in a rat for the winter.

2549
02:16:15,070 --> 02:16:17,510
And they hide in your walls because they're cold.

2550
02:16:18,470 --> 02:16:19,790
One day I will meet Minto.

2551
02:16:19,990 --> 02:16:20,990
Okay, wait a second.

2552
02:16:21,450 --> 02:16:21,710
Wait.

2553
02:16:25,250 --> 02:16:26,090
You... Okay.

2554
02:16:27,170 --> 02:16:28,550
Please PM me Mint Phantom.

2555
02:16:28,810 --> 02:16:31,510
If I ever meet you, you have to.

2556
02:16:31,850 --> 02:16:33,750
You have to have the balls.

2557
02:16:33,990 --> 02:16:35,230
You have to.

2558
02:16:35,390 --> 02:16:37,510
You have to tell me that it's you.

2559
02:16:38,050 --> 02:16:39,430
You have to.

2560
02:16:39,710 --> 02:16:41,670
You have the balls to have that name.

2561
02:16:41,730 --> 02:16:44,550
You have to have the balls to say it to my face too.

2562
02:16:46,590 --> 02:16:48,090
You have to.

2563
02:16:49,510 --> 02:16:50,690
Sounds like a warning.

2564
02:16:50,690 --> 02:16:52,950
Yeah, it really sounds like a threat, honestly.

2565
02:16:56,770 --> 02:16:58,690
You have to be like, hey, by the way, Minto.

2566
02:16:58,830 --> 02:17:00,430
I have to have a face to the name.

2567
02:17:01,230 --> 02:17:02,070
By the way, Minto.

2568
02:17:04,150 --> 02:17:05,350
Please PM me.

2569
02:17:11,810 --> 02:17:15,170
The fact that some of you guys have such courage to say certain things.

2570
02:17:15,590 --> 02:17:18,650
You have to have the courage to say it to my face.

2571
02:17:19,130 --> 02:17:21,530
I mean, like in person, you know.

2572
02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:25,030
You can't just be a little keyboard guy and be like...

2573
02:17:25,030 --> 02:17:27,210
She'll never know what I look like.

2574
02:17:27,270 --> 02:17:31,650
No, I have to be able to scan your retinas and be like...

2575
02:17:33,650 --> 02:17:34,850
Yeah, I will.

2576
02:17:34,910 --> 02:17:35,310
Don't worry.

2577
02:17:38,310 --> 02:17:39,050
Okay, good.

2578
02:17:42,130 --> 02:17:44,490
Have you gotten to meet EMTA yet?

2579
02:17:44,550 --> 02:17:45,410
I haven't.

2580
02:17:45,550 --> 02:17:46,490
I want to meet everybody.

2581
02:17:50,650 --> 02:17:53,650
If I'm ever at a convention near you...

2582
02:17:55,050 --> 02:17:55,590
Please...

2583
02:17:56,530 --> 02:17:58,170
Please come say hi.

2584
02:17:58,870 --> 02:17:59,490
Oh, sorry.

2585
02:17:59,610 --> 02:18:00,650
That was my...

2586
02:18:00,650 --> 02:18:02,710
That was my controller.

2587
02:18:04,470 --> 02:18:05,610
Which I might be.

2588
02:18:06,270 --> 02:18:10,210
Well, I'm not going to be at the Anime Week in Atlanta convention itself.

2589
02:18:10,330 --> 02:18:16,270
But I will be in Atlanta and then there might be another East Coast convention that I'll be at...

2590
02:18:17,370 --> 02:18:18,250
Shortly after.

2591
02:18:29,770 --> 02:18:30,830
Next try, princess.

2592
02:18:33,450 --> 02:18:35,710
Have you ever thought of doing some kind of virtual meet and greet?

2593
02:18:36,070 --> 02:18:36,610
I have!

2594
02:18:36,870 --> 02:18:38,810
I want to do something in VRChat.

2595
02:18:39,030 --> 02:18:42,010
I just haven't had the time to do it yet.

2596
02:18:44,170 --> 02:18:45,130
But also...

2597
02:18:45,130 --> 02:18:47,510
I don't know if like...

2598
02:18:48,070 --> 02:18:49,490
If... How to do it.

2599
02:18:49,890 --> 02:18:51,870
You know, like if it'd be like a...

2600
02:18:51,870 --> 02:18:55,570
Single file, line, everybody kind of thing or...

2601
02:18:57,810 --> 02:18:58,770
How, so...

2602
02:18:58,770 --> 02:19:02,050
You know, sometimes when I'm bored I upload Ace Combat videos just for fun.

2603
02:19:04,290 --> 02:19:04,770
But...

2604
02:19:04,770 --> 02:19:07,430
It's more to show my skill, how much it changed.

2605
02:19:07,550 --> 02:19:07,650
Ah!

2606
02:19:08,310 --> 02:19:09,230
Like a diary.

2607
02:19:09,870 --> 02:19:11,570
Someday I will give a drawing to Minto.

2608
02:19:12,310 --> 02:19:14,010
I will wait for that day.

2609
02:19:17,730 --> 02:19:19,050
I will wait, Cyber.

2610
02:19:21,510 --> 02:19:23,490
I drop my spaghetti either way for sure.

2611
02:19:23,590 --> 02:19:26,870
I'm always more awkward than you, so don't worry about it.

2612
02:19:28,790 --> 02:19:30,870
Mint, do you own a Colt single action army?

2613
02:19:34,430 --> 02:19:35,430
Technically no.

2614
02:19:35,890 --> 02:19:39,650
I have a wooden revolver, but you know...

2615
02:19:39,650 --> 02:19:40,110
Why?

2616
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:42,310
You're...

2617
02:19:43,110 --> 02:19:43,990
Not yet.

2618
02:19:44,730 --> 02:19:45,970
I want to get one.

2619
02:19:46,390 --> 02:19:49,270
I've seen one in Japan, but...

2620
02:19:50,150 --> 02:19:52,930
Like, I've gone to the Airsoft store, you know.

2621
02:19:54,710 --> 02:19:57,050
Do you have any 2025 conventions scheduled yet?

2622
02:19:58,310 --> 02:19:58,990
Not...

2623
02:19:58,990 --> 02:19:59,990
Really.

2624
02:20:02,110 --> 02:20:07,390
Japan Expo Paris overlaps with Anime Expo, so I'm safe from stinky ghosts for another year.

2625
02:20:07,390 --> 02:20:10,210
What makes you think I'm going to Anime Expo?

2626
02:20:14,010 --> 02:20:18,590
Only one convention has reached out to me for 2025.

2627
02:20:21,110 --> 02:20:23,610
Some other ones I've had to decline, but...

2628
02:20:24,370 --> 02:20:27,750
Only one that I think I can maybe do.

2629
02:20:28,330 --> 02:20:29,010
I'm not sure.

2630
02:20:33,030 --> 02:20:36,610
So, it's not like a matter of me...

2631
02:20:40,010 --> 02:20:40,450
Like...

2632
02:20:41,190 --> 02:20:44,210
It's not me going to them and being like, please invite me!

2633
02:20:44,410 --> 02:20:47,390
It's always like, you know, they have to invite me, so...

2634
02:20:53,990 --> 02:20:55,970
Are you going to do cons in Asia?

2635
02:20:56,210 --> 02:20:57,490
I would if...

2636
02:20:57,490 --> 02:21:02,130
Well, there have been some that have invited me, but the timing has not aligned, you know.

2637
02:21:04,010 --> 02:21:04,370
Um...

2638
02:21:04,370 --> 02:21:09,090
Like, I was supposed to do one that Doki did recently, but I had to not do it.

2639
02:21:09,190 --> 02:21:10,630
The timing was not good for me.

2640
02:21:14,150 --> 02:21:14,510
Sometimes...

2641
02:21:15,030 --> 02:21:17,110
Sometimes timing does not always work out.

2642
02:21:22,850 --> 02:21:28,050
And then also, I went kind of crazy over the summer with conventions, and...

2643
02:21:28,050 --> 02:21:30,630
I don't want to say I got burnt out, but I was just like, oh gosh.

2644
02:21:31,010 --> 02:21:33,010
I'm going to too many events, I need to stream.

2645
02:21:37,330 --> 02:21:37,730
Uh...

2646
02:21:37,730 --> 02:21:41,870
Speaking of Airsoft, they make the Mark 23 SOCOM as well.

2647
02:21:42,410 --> 02:21:43,490
Would you get one of those too?

2648
02:21:44,170 --> 02:21:45,390
Sorry, that's my brain rot.

2649
02:21:46,670 --> 02:21:48,790
I want to collect Airsoft stuff, yeah.

2650
02:21:49,430 --> 02:21:51,770
I've looked it up, of like, people...

2651
02:21:51,770 --> 02:21:57,170
Like, I've seen the Reddit threads that are just like, I want to get this Airsoft in Japan, can I bring it back to America?

2652
02:21:59,470 --> 02:21:59,870
So...

2653
02:21:59,870 --> 02:22:01,930
And it's fun because some of...

2654
02:22:01,930 --> 02:22:03,010
Actually, hold on, let me see.

2655
02:22:03,010 --> 02:22:05,370
I don't know if I can show these pictures.

2656
02:22:05,910 --> 02:22:11,130
Because every time I go to the Airsoft store, they have like, mirrors on them and stuff, you know.

2657
02:22:11,230 --> 02:22:13,010
And I don't want to show you my...

2658
02:22:13,010 --> 02:22:15,010
Too much ghostly energy, you know, in the pictures.

2659
02:22:16,170 --> 02:22:17,730
Might curse you a little bit.

2660
02:22:18,790 --> 02:22:20,590
Might curse you if I show you.

2661
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:28,220
That's Tokyo Game Show.

2662
02:22:28,940 --> 02:22:30,500
I probably went after, right?

2663
02:22:31,940 --> 02:22:32,380
That's...

2664
02:22:37,820 --> 02:22:39,980
Maybe I didn't take pictures last trip.

2665
02:22:49,880 --> 02:22:51,480
That's a Shoebill.

2666
02:22:54,580 --> 02:22:55,540
That's a Disney.

2667
02:22:59,620 --> 02:23:00,860
That's a Anisoma.

2668
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:05,260
That's a mint cafe.

2669
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:09,720
That's fireworks with my friends.

2670
02:23:09,940 --> 02:23:11,600
Did I ever tell you guys that?

2671
02:23:11,660 --> 02:23:13,600
I went to go see fireworks with some of my friends.

2672
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:15,120
And we rented Yukata.

2673
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:18,100
It was my first time ever doing something like that.

2674
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:21,180
You're so cute.

2675
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:25,040
Can you show off your MGS collection?

2676
02:23:25,160 --> 02:23:25,860
I want to!

2677
02:23:27,560 --> 02:23:31,980
But I feel that my ghostly energy might show in my cabinet.

2678
02:23:32,440 --> 02:23:33,160
The way it is.

2679
02:23:33,560 --> 02:23:34,560
Zack, welcome to membership.

2680
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:35,320
Thank you.

2681
02:23:35,320 --> 02:23:39,340
Maybe not as a video, but I can always post it somewhere, you know?

2682
02:23:39,860 --> 02:23:41,540
If I can try and get a good picture.

2683
02:23:44,500 --> 02:23:45,900
You have friends?

2684
02:23:46,040 --> 02:23:46,900
I know, right?

2685
02:23:47,400 --> 02:23:47,880
Crazy.

2686
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:50,280
It was so sweet though.

2687
02:23:51,740 --> 02:23:54,400
Well, I think maybe I did post a picture of...

2688
02:23:57,800 --> 02:23:59,080
Plushie, tiny Minto.

2689
02:24:00,380 --> 02:24:02,140
And the fireworks in the background.

2690
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:03,580
But it's so funny.

2691
02:24:03,820 --> 02:24:04,240
Hold on.

2692
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:05,560
I wonder if I have any...

2693
02:24:05,560 --> 02:24:07,660
I don't want to show a video and you can hear them though.

2694
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:08,580
Just in case.

2695
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:13,500
But it was funny because the place we went to for the fireworks...

2696
02:24:13,500 --> 02:24:16,760
We didn't have a bad spot, but we didn't have a great spot.

2697
02:24:16,900 --> 02:24:20,660
And there was like this guy in the background that was on the highway.

2698
02:24:21,080 --> 02:24:21,960
Like, he was on the road.

2699
02:24:22,140 --> 02:24:24,200
And he just would not shut up the entire time.

2700
02:24:24,280 --> 02:24:27,760
He would be like, please don't stop and watch the fireworks.

2701
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:29,300
Please keep going.

2702
02:24:30,820 --> 02:24:33,320
Please don't stop and watch the fireworks.

2703
02:24:33,320 --> 02:24:34,520
Please keep going.

2704
02:24:34,700 --> 02:24:36,300
So we just ruined the vibes.

2705
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:40,900
Do you have any tips for cosplayers solo infiltrating Comiket for the first time?

2706
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:46,500
I hope you got your cosplayer ticket.

2707
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:47,540
First off.

2708
02:24:48,740 --> 02:24:53,840
And bring a small rolly suitcase to change into and everything.

2709
02:24:54,060 --> 02:24:55,760
But also, I plan on bringing...

2710
02:24:55,760 --> 02:24:58,140
A lot of people bring small rolly suitcases anyway.

2711
02:24:58,920 --> 02:24:59,320
Because...

2712
02:25:00,780 --> 02:25:01,580
The doujins...

2713
02:25:01,580 --> 02:25:03,460
They get so heavy, you know?

2714
02:25:03,560 --> 02:25:05,140
So you want to put them into something.

2715
02:25:06,260 --> 02:25:07,440
Will you go to Afkai?

2716
02:25:07,740 --> 02:25:09,800
I was thinking of making a trip to America if you are.

2717
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:12,500
I would love to go to Afkai if they have me.

2718
02:25:12,780 --> 02:25:16,140
If they have me, then I will go.

2719
02:25:18,400 --> 02:25:20,800
Oh, I bet you got a license for that cosplay.

2720
02:25:23,860 --> 02:25:25,060
I failed the lottery.

2721
02:25:28,140 --> 02:25:29,620
I don't think you can cosplay then.

2722
02:25:34,140 --> 02:25:34,540
Because...

2723
02:25:34,540 --> 02:25:38,420
I can't believe that Comiket this year is a lottery, first of all.

2724
02:25:40,060 --> 02:25:45,600
You can't get your confession to a girl you like interrupted by fireworks because some guy is yapping to get moving.

2725
02:25:46,500 --> 02:25:47,980
He is the one interrupting.

2726
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:50,380
Oh my gosh, Tuna, who are you confessing to?

2727
02:25:50,980 --> 02:25:51,820
Oh my god.

2728
02:25:51,820 --> 02:25:51,920
This is weird.

2729
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:57,140
Is it not normally a lottery?

2730
02:25:57,460 --> 02:25:58,960
I would used to buy...

2731
02:25:58,960 --> 02:26:01,900
I got my tickets at Melon Books.

2732
02:26:06,900 --> 02:26:10,340
I didn't think that Comiket is a lottery.

2733
02:26:12,980 --> 02:26:14,400
Can you not just show up and cosplay?

2734
02:26:16,180 --> 02:26:18,180
Most events in Japan...

2735
02:26:18,180 --> 02:26:19,820
You have to...

2736
02:26:19,820 --> 02:26:21,680
If you are planning to cosplay at them...

2737
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:24,980
They don't allow you to wear the cosplay on the train and stuff.

2738
02:26:25,340 --> 02:26:27,760
Or rather, they don't want people doing that.

2739
02:26:28,140 --> 02:26:29,860
So you have to get a cosplay ticket.

2740
02:26:30,360 --> 02:26:32,260
And then you go and you change there.

2741
02:26:33,580 --> 02:26:35,880
And then you...

2742
02:26:37,140 --> 02:26:41,380
Can have the designated cosplay area stuff.

2743
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:46,300
I don't know, I guess they just discourage...

2744
02:26:46,300 --> 02:26:48,300
They just don't want people dressing up on...

2745
02:26:49,700 --> 02:26:50,220
Trains.

2746
02:26:50,580 --> 02:26:52,420
I guess they think it's a disturbance.

2747
02:26:53,380 --> 02:26:54,540
Honestly, I'm like...

2748
02:26:55,520 --> 02:26:56,020
I don't...

2749
02:26:56,020 --> 02:26:59,780
If you want to embarrass yourself by being in cosplay on the train...

2750
02:26:59,780 --> 02:27:00,560
That's...

2751
02:27:00,560 --> 02:27:01,640
That's your prerogative.

2752
02:27:02,780 --> 02:27:03,980
But I guess...

2753
02:27:03,980 --> 02:27:06,100
So many people would do it maybe, right?

2754
02:27:06,160 --> 02:27:06,760
I don't know.

2755
02:27:07,780 --> 02:27:10,120
I think it's...

2756
02:27:10,120 --> 02:27:12,460
A silly rule...

2757
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:15,460
But it is a rule nonetheless, so...

2758
02:27:16,400 --> 02:27:20,260
And you don't want to be the foreigner that ruins it for other people.

2759
02:27:20,660 --> 02:27:20,860
You know?

2760
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:23,860
So...

2761
02:27:23,860 --> 02:27:25,280
You want to...

2762
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:28,100
You don't want to be the person that...

2763
02:27:28,100 --> 02:27:29,540
Makes it so that they don't...

2764
02:27:29,540 --> 02:27:32,440
That they stop selling foreigner tickets or something like that.

2765
02:27:32,560 --> 02:27:33,300
Because of it.

2766
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:34,860
So...

2767
02:27:34,860 --> 02:27:37,060
Unfortunately, you just gotta abide by the rules.

2768
02:27:39,180 --> 02:27:41,800
I see cosplayers on the bus for western cons.

2769
02:27:41,900 --> 02:27:42,340
I know!

2770
02:27:42,540 --> 02:27:43,840
In the west, they don't care at all.

2771
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:46,700
Do I need a ticket for the Indy Jones watch?

2772
02:27:48,600 --> 02:27:49,080
No!

2773
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:50,680
You should be good, Jordan!

2774
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:52,960
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited to watch Indiana Jones.

2775
02:27:54,480 --> 02:27:56,660
I'm offended by all the salarymen wearing their suits.

2776
02:27:57,020 --> 02:27:57,240
Yeah!

2777
02:27:58,000 --> 02:27:58,460
Yeah!

2778
02:28:00,920 --> 02:28:02,900
Because it's funny, because...

2779
02:28:02,900 --> 02:28:05,140
I mean, you don't often see people in like...

2780
02:28:05,720 --> 02:28:06,200
Niche...

2781
02:28:06,200 --> 02:28:07,780
Clothes, I guess, on the train.

2782
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:09,080
But you still see it.

2783
02:28:09,480 --> 02:28:11,240
So what's the difference between that and cosplay?

2784
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:15,180
Many stalker issues for cosplayers.

2785
02:28:15,220 --> 02:28:16,320
So maybe a safety issue.

2786
02:28:17,380 --> 02:28:19,280
I never thought of it like that.

2787
02:28:20,640 --> 02:28:21,080
Maybe.

2788
02:28:22,420 --> 02:28:24,740
And then also, you know, I guess...

2789
02:28:24,740 --> 02:28:27,600
Some cosplay can be a little...

2790
02:28:28,120 --> 02:28:29,900
A little, you know...

2791
02:28:29,900 --> 02:28:30,840
So they're just like...

2792
02:28:30,840 --> 02:28:32,620
We don't want that on the trains.

2793
02:28:34,820 --> 02:28:35,960
A little spicy.

2794
02:28:36,560 --> 02:28:38,100
I got something to recommend if you're interested.

2795
02:28:38,320 --> 02:28:39,260
It's Ace Combat 7.

2796
02:28:39,260 --> 02:28:40,000
Artbook!

2797
02:28:40,420 --> 02:28:41,160
Ace at War.

2798
02:28:41,260 --> 02:28:42,100
There's lore from old...

2799
02:28:42,100 --> 02:28:43,500
I'm writing it down?

2800
02:28:43,580 --> 02:28:44,060
Thank you, Nan.

2801
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:45,800
What's it called?

2802
02:28:45,880 --> 02:28:46,360
Wait, hold on.

2803
02:28:47,300 --> 02:28:48,380
Ace at War.

2804
02:28:51,640 --> 02:28:52,480
I'll get it.

2805
02:28:53,500 --> 02:28:54,620
Unleash the horny.

2806
02:28:56,320 --> 02:28:56,800
Huh?

2807
02:29:02,020 --> 02:29:02,900
What was that?

2808
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:06,800
Please don't watch the fireworks.

2809
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:07,140
Pew!

2810
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:07,800
Pew!

2811
02:29:08,200 --> 02:29:08,900
What was that?

2812
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:10,120
Pew!

2813
02:29:10,340 --> 02:29:10,620
Pew!

2814
02:29:10,780 --> 02:29:13,260
Please stop watching the fireworks.

2815
02:29:13,380 --> 02:29:14,340
Please keep moving.

2816
02:29:14,540 --> 02:29:15,780
Please keep moving.

2817
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:27,900
But is it a cosplay if Minto cosplays as Minto?

2818
02:29:28,800 --> 02:29:29,660
I don't know.

2819
02:29:30,640 --> 02:29:31,620
This is me!

2820
02:29:32,120 --> 02:29:33,600
You can't stop my identity!

2821
02:29:35,060 --> 02:29:36,740
Sadly, there's only JP version.

2822
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:38,740
The EN version already sold out.

2823
02:29:39,460 --> 02:29:40,380
I'll find it.

2824
02:29:40,600 --> 02:29:40,840
Somewhere.

2825
02:29:48,220 --> 02:29:48,740
But...

2826
02:29:50,140 --> 02:29:52,480
Also, if you're cosplaying as Comiket...

2827
02:29:52,480 --> 02:29:55,060
If you don't feel comfortable changing in front of people...

2828
02:29:55,060 --> 02:29:57,140
Maybe bring like a little...

2829
02:29:57,140 --> 02:29:59,000
Set like a...

2830
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,920
I don't know how to say it.

2831
02:30:01,060 --> 02:30:01,840
Not a tent.

2832
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:03,340
But something like that.

2833
02:30:03,740 --> 02:30:05,920
You can set up easily.

2834
02:30:07,080 --> 02:30:09,000
So you can hide yourself.

2835
02:30:09,740 --> 02:30:10,620
Or maybe...

2836
02:30:10,620 --> 02:30:12,360
Yeah, like a partition.

2837
02:30:12,640 --> 02:30:13,340
A portable wall.

2838
02:30:13,460 --> 02:30:14,120
Something like that.

2839
02:30:15,460 --> 02:30:17,560
Because that's how you change.

2840
02:30:17,660 --> 02:30:18,960
In a room with everybody.

2841
02:30:21,500 --> 02:30:22,060
So...

2842
02:30:23,020 --> 02:30:24,420
If you're like...

2843
02:30:24,420 --> 02:30:25,540
It's embarrassing.

2844
02:30:26,780 --> 02:30:29,100
I mean, there is a girl's section and a guy's section.

2845
02:30:32,640 --> 02:30:33,160
But...

2846
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:36,660
A cardboard box.

2847
02:30:36,740 --> 02:30:38,020
It could even be a cardboard box.

2848
02:30:40,620 --> 02:30:42,760
Are there actual portable changing tents?

2849
02:30:45,180 --> 02:30:45,700
Like...

2850
02:30:45,700 --> 02:30:46,260
At Comiket?

2851
02:30:46,840 --> 02:30:50,860
I tried going to summer Comiket and sitting on asphalt in the hot sun for two hours.

2852
02:30:50,940 --> 02:30:51,560
It was true misery.

2853
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:53,140
I believe it.

2854
02:30:53,380 --> 02:30:55,660
I don't think I'll ever try for summer Comiket.

2855
02:30:56,280 --> 02:30:57,240
I can't...

2856
02:30:57,240 --> 02:30:57,920
I don't know.

2857
02:30:57,920 --> 02:30:58,200
So...

2858
02:30:58,200 --> 02:31:02,060
I have a few circles that I'm wanting to hit up this year.

2859
02:31:02,660 --> 02:31:03,880
For winter Comiket.

2860
02:31:05,200 --> 02:31:06,920
I want to go to Fuwamoko's mama.

2861
02:31:07,820 --> 02:31:08,540
Ikomochi-san.

2862
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:11,420
I want to get their set.

2863
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:12,200
It's very cute.

2864
02:31:12,940 --> 02:31:14,080
So I'm gonna try for that.

2865
02:31:15,660 --> 02:31:16,960
Obviously, Ayami-mama.

2866
02:31:17,340 --> 02:31:19,580
I don't care if she tries to give it to me.

2867
02:31:19,640 --> 02:31:20,600
I want to pay for it.

2868
02:31:20,680 --> 02:31:23,040
She always tries to just give me stuff.

2869
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:23,720
But I'm like, no.

2870
02:31:23,720 --> 02:31:28,300
I'll send her her fan box stuff that comes in the mail.

2871
02:31:28,440 --> 02:31:29,460
And I'm like, look Ayami!

2872
02:31:29,960 --> 02:31:31,060
I got this.

2873
02:31:31,060 --> 02:31:32,780
And she's like, why are you paying for it?

2874
02:31:40,360 --> 02:31:40,800
And...

2875
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:43,300
Natsukomi is in a word, moist.

2876
02:31:47,820 --> 02:31:49,320
There's a couple other artists.

2877
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:51,940
I don't think they have put up their stuff yet.

2878
02:31:51,940 --> 02:31:53,900
Their catalog yet.

2879
02:31:55,140 --> 02:31:57,200
So, I will see.

2880
02:31:57,520 --> 02:31:59,660
I usually go for Kaori.

2881
02:32:02,260 --> 02:32:02,940
Pan.

2882
02:32:05,480 --> 02:32:06,920
A few others.

2883
02:32:09,800 --> 02:32:10,480
Depends.

2884
02:32:11,800 --> 02:32:12,780
You're actually too nice.

2885
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:15,020
Oh yeah, I get stinky.

2886
02:32:15,500 --> 02:32:17,260
I don't want to go in the summer.

2887
02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:19,480
So...

2888
02:32:19,480 --> 02:32:20,960
It's musty.

2889
02:32:21,740 --> 02:32:23,420
It's musty.

2890
02:32:27,020 --> 02:32:27,940
Yeah.

2891
02:32:28,660 --> 02:32:29,240
I'm excited.

2892
02:32:30,920 --> 02:32:32,860
Any chance of a holiday matsuri appearance?

2893
02:32:35,440 --> 02:32:36,380
Never say never.

2894
02:32:43,220 --> 02:32:44,100
Stinky minky.

2895
02:32:44,100 --> 02:32:44,660
No!

2896
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:47,460
Blue Archive taking over Comiket.

2897
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:48,040
You know what?

2898
02:32:48,400 --> 02:32:51,700
I've never been someone who has been into the popular thing.

2899
02:32:52,400 --> 02:32:52,620
You know?

2900
02:32:52,840 --> 02:32:56,680
When Genshin was taking over the western conventions and stuff.

2901
02:32:56,780 --> 02:32:57,480
I was like...

2902
02:32:58,100 --> 02:32:59,460
Not really into it.

2903
02:32:59,800 --> 02:33:01,860
But to be a part of the popular thing.

2904
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:03,600
Just feels so good.

2905
02:33:04,260 --> 02:33:05,440
Because now I'm like, yeah!

2906
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:07,860
Blue Archive is taking over the Comiket!

2907
02:33:08,520 --> 02:33:09,080
Yippee!

2908
02:33:10,780 --> 02:33:11,340
Yeah!

2909
02:33:11,340 --> 02:33:12,660
It's so fun!

2910
02:33:13,500 --> 02:33:15,360
To be part of the popular thing.

2911
02:33:15,820 --> 02:33:17,040
And be able to buy things.

2912
02:33:17,600 --> 02:33:18,880
Characters that you like.

2913
02:33:19,100 --> 02:33:20,860
And things that you want.

2914
02:33:20,980 --> 02:33:22,180
And you're just like, wow!

2915
02:33:22,900 --> 02:33:23,200
Yeah!

2916
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:25,980
Finally!

2917
02:33:27,900 --> 02:33:28,860
So happy.

2918
02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:32,080
So I'm glad.

2919
02:33:32,940 --> 02:33:34,440
It's nice knowing what the hype is about.

2920
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:35,160
I know.

2921
02:33:36,440 --> 02:33:38,800
Hipster minto, but not by choice.

2922
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:41,540
I want to be into the fun, popular stuff.

2923
02:33:42,080 --> 02:33:42,980
It's just I...

2924
02:33:42,980 --> 02:33:45,420
Somehow get into the not popular stuff.

2925
02:33:48,100 --> 02:33:50,420
And now the thing that I like is popular.

2926
02:33:50,700 --> 02:33:51,780
And I'm so...

2927
02:33:51,780 --> 02:33:53,340
Feels good!

2928
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:57,020
Feels good.

2929
02:33:57,800 --> 02:34:00,440
After being into the not popular thing for so long.

2930
02:34:02,120 --> 02:34:03,720
I'd love to go to Comiket someday.

2931
02:34:04,060 --> 02:34:05,580
It is a fun experience.

2932
02:34:06,620 --> 02:34:07,760
It's fun because...

2933
02:34:08,320 --> 02:34:09,720
It's just such a...

2934
02:34:10,340 --> 02:34:11,660
There's that energy of...

2935
02:34:13,320 --> 02:34:13,340
Fans.

2936
02:34:13,900 --> 02:34:14,360
Otaku.

2937
02:34:14,620 --> 02:34:15,620
Gathered all around.

2938
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:17,500
And then you have like...

2939
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:19,240
Of course I love the doujin stuff.

2940
02:34:19,360 --> 02:34:21,380
But also the official stuff is very fun too.

2941
02:34:27,140 --> 02:34:28,960
The mainstream glow up.

2942
02:34:30,440 --> 02:34:32,660
I'm into the popular stuff right now.

2943
02:34:32,760 --> 02:34:33,060
Minto.

2944
02:34:33,060 --> 02:34:33,180
Minto.

2945
02:34:34,860 --> 02:34:36,180
Oh yeah, baby.

2946
02:34:37,360 --> 02:34:38,500
I'm the popular.

2947
02:34:38,660 --> 02:34:39,720
I'm the hot stuff.

2948
02:34:41,400 --> 02:34:43,120
Is there official stuff at Comiket?

2949
02:34:43,220 --> 02:34:43,960
Yeah, there is.

2950
02:34:45,400 --> 02:34:47,240
Yeah, there's an official area.

2951
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:49,300
And there's a...

2952
02:34:49,300 --> 02:34:52,280
Of course all of you see the doujin area.

2953
02:34:57,160 --> 02:34:58,920
It's all like different halls.

2954
02:34:59,260 --> 02:35:00,740
It's all separated into.

2955
02:35:06,600 --> 02:35:07,100
Hmm.

2956
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:09,540
Well guys, I'm starting to get sleepy.

2957
02:35:09,940 --> 02:35:10,380
And hungry.

2958
02:35:11,100 --> 02:35:12,160
So I'm gonna go eat.

2959
02:35:14,120 --> 02:35:15,120
And sleep.

2960
02:35:16,380 --> 02:35:16,880
Tomorrow.

2961
02:35:18,140 --> 02:35:19,140
Indiana Jones.

2962
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:20,660
The game.

2963
02:35:21,540 --> 02:35:22,380
But not the game.

2964
02:35:22,700 --> 02:35:23,700
We're watching along.

2965
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:26,060
If you are part of membership.

2966
02:35:26,560 --> 02:35:28,160
And you want to watch Indiana Jones.

2967
02:35:28,600 --> 02:35:29,480
At the same time.

2968
02:35:29,580 --> 02:35:31,120
Yeah, I'll eat and sleep at the same time.

2969
02:35:31,520 --> 02:35:32,000
I'd win.

2970
02:35:36,720 --> 02:35:37,740
Today I watched you...

2971
02:35:37,740 --> 02:35:38,700
To the stream.

2972
02:35:38,780 --> 02:35:38,960
Wait.

2973
02:35:39,240 --> 02:35:42,160
While I watched you stream, so much that I crashed my plane in Project Wingman.

2974
02:35:45,880 --> 02:35:47,160
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

2975
02:35:47,300 --> 02:35:49,200

2976
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:51,740
Thank you guys.

02:35:52,120 --> 02:35:53,140
Thank you guys for the stream.

2978
02:35:53,260 --> 02:35:55,420
Thank you for being all so considerate.

2979
02:35:55,640 --> 02:35:58,520
And allowing me to be so considerate as well.

2980
02:35:58,700 --> 02:35:58,960
CC!

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2984
02:36:02,740 --> 02:36:02,860
Yeah.

2985
02:36:05,180 --> 02:36:06,900
I'll see you guys when I see you next.

2986
02:36:07,940 --> 02:36:08,900
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

2987
02:36:11,880 --> 02:36:12,760
Thank you.

2988
02:36:13,400 --> 02:36:14,120
And I'll see you guys.

2989
02:36:14,880 --> 02:36:15,780
I gotta rest my voice.

2990
02:36:16,320 --> 02:36:18,960
Since I've been doing so much.

2991
02:36:19,660 --> 02:36:20,860
Corki, take off.

2992
02:36:22,060 --> 02:36:23,200
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

2993
02:36:26,600 --> 02:36:27,040
Otsumita.

2994
02:36:27,880 --> 02:36:28,760
Itterasshai, everybody.

2995
02:36:29,300 --> 02:36:30,480
Pyropunk, thanks for the 5 gifted.

2996
02:36:30,480 --> 02:36:35,520
Will you be streaming the indie game tomorrow before the watchalong?

2997
02:36:37,100 --> 02:36:38,240
I don't know yet.

2998
02:36:39,400 --> 02:36:42,320
I have to get it and see if my computer runs it.

2999
02:36:42,540 --> 02:36:44,920
Because everyone's just like, Can your computer run it, Mito?

3000
02:36:46,080 --> 02:36:47,620
Do you have the specs?

3001
02:36:48,340 --> 02:36:48,800
Asakusa!

3002
02:36:50,180 --> 02:36:51,180
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

3003
02:36:51,260 --> 02:36:52,320
What is this profile picture?

3004
02:36:52,920 --> 02:36:54,300
Thanks for the superchat.

3005
02:36:55,940 --> 02:36:56,940
It's gigaheavy.

3006
02:36:57,040 --> 02:36:59,260
It's like 120 gigs.

3007
02:36:59,260 --> 02:37:00,440
It's crazy.

3008
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,120
It's crazy.

3009
02:37:03,700 --> 02:37:05,140
K5, thanks for the 5 gifted.

3010
02:37:05,960 --> 02:37:06,900
Is your PC beef?

3011
02:37:07,400 --> 02:37:09,600
I've been working on getting parts.

3012
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:11,060
Just in case.

3013
02:37:11,620 --> 02:37:12,900
Maybe next year.

3014
02:37:13,040 --> 02:37:14,540
If parts get more expensive.

3015
02:37:15,960 --> 02:37:18,160
I've been working on getting some stuff.

3016
02:37:18,300 --> 02:37:19,280
Just in case.

3017
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:25,120
But...

3018
02:37:29,340 --> 02:37:30,940
You're not waiting for the new GPUs?

3019
02:37:30,940 --> 02:37:32,200
I haven't gotten that yet.

3020
02:37:32,880 --> 02:37:35,380
I just got some new fans.

3021
02:37:36,500 --> 02:37:37,460
I got some other stuff.

3022
02:37:38,480 --> 02:37:38,780
Joy!

3023
02:37:39,880 --> 02:37:41,860
Thank you so much for the 5th day.

3024
02:37:42,300 --> 02:37:43,040

02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:45,780
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3026
02:37:46,240 --> 02:37:47,320
Appreciate it.

3027
02:37:48,420 --> 02:37:50,440
I'm downloading more RAM.

3028
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:52,340
I gotta get those.

3029
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:53,380
I gotta buy those.

3030
02:37:53,740 --> 02:37:54,420
I gotta buy those.

3031
02:37:56,180 --> 02:37:57,340
I gotta get those.

3032
02:37:58,200 --> 02:37:58,800
Okay.

3033
02:37:59,360 --> 02:38:00,040
See you later.

3034
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:01,520

And see you later.

3037
02:38:07,340 --> 02:38:07,960
Bye bye.

3038
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:08,940
Have a good day.

3039
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:09,860
Have a good day.

3040
02:38:10,300 --> 02:38:11,200
Bye bye.

3041
02:38:12,640 --> 02:38:14,160
Don't forget about us.

3042
02:38:14,480 --> 02:38:15,060
Shut up.

3043
02:38:15,100 --> 02:38:16,040
You know what I mean.

3044
02:38:16,920 --> 02:38:17,400
Dummies.

3045
02:38:17,920 --> 02:38:18,520
I could never.

3046
02:38:19,080 --> 02:38:19,420
Bye.

3047
02:38:33,100 --> 02:38:34,880
Thank you for the 20 gifted.
