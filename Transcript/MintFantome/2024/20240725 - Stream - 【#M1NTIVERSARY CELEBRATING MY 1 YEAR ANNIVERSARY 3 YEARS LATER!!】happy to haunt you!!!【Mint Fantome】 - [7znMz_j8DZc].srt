1
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,220
Thank you, Mayu.

2
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:34,900
Sorry.

3
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,180
I didn't think I would get so small.

4
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,600
Hello.

5
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,610
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

6
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,030
Happy anniversary.

7
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:51,790
Thank you!

8
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,020
Thank you.

9
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,780
Thank you!

10
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,610
I'm nervous.

11
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,790
I'm nervous!

12
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,430
You would think that like...

13
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,810
You would think that like...

14
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,810
If I have an anniversary...

15
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,670
My first anniversary that I'm celebrating...

16
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,610
Three years later...

17
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,470
That I would be more prepared.

18
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,110
You would think that...

19
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,710
I would be more prepared.

20
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,630
But I'm...

21
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,610
Not.

22
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,150
Oh, gosh.

23
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,790
Can and Mintai...

24
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,990
Let's stop this now.

26
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,010
Let's stop this now.

27
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,150
Let's stop this now.

28
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,750
This slander.

29
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,240
Just hang out?

30
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,780
I have some...

31
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,900
I have a few things.

32
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,880
Um...

33
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,740
Some...

34
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,140
Some...

35
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,860
Uh...

36
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,780
Plans, I suppose.

37
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,000
Anyway, welcome everybody to my not-birthday.

38
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,380
Oh!

39
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,400
Okay.

40
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,960
To my not-birthday.

41
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,880
I'll never have a birthday.

42
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,420
I'll have a death day.

43
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,260
Thank you for...

44
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,540
Thank you guys for all the gifted memberships.

45
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,100
Thank you!

46
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,880
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

47
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Kept us waiting.

48
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,100
Huh?

49
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,060
Truly.

50
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,800
Um...

51
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,120
Yeah.

52
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,800
Any plans for anime-NYC.

53
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,460
I can neither confirm, nor deny anything.

54
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,890
A dragon.

55
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,610
Thank you!

56
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,550
Oh my gosh...

57
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,110
Pyro bug.

58
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,310
Thank you for the 50 giftign.

59
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:23,770
Thank you!

60
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,790
Holy cow!

61
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,830
Oh my gosh, thank you for the Hakasuba flux!

62
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:27,490
Thank you!

63
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,950
Happy anniversary...

64
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,910
Oh my god, thank you!

65
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,200
Thank you so much!

66
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,780
Thank you!

67
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,040
Oh my god...

68
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,680
Happy anniversary, thank you!

69
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,720
Thank you guys so much!

70
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,200
Thank you!

71
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,160
I just started!

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,400
I just started the stream!

73
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,620
Um...

74
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,040
On this day...

75
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,940
On this day...

76
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,620
On this day...

77
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,680
Four years ago?

78
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,520
On this day, four years ago...

79
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,480
I streamed for the first time ever in my afterlife.

80
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,480
Oh my god, thank you!

81
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,760
Kept this waiting for a while...

82
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,220
Katsu, thank you for the 50...

83
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,680
Thank you guys for all the gifts and memberships!

84
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,600
And all the super chats!

85
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,880
I'm getting a little overwhelmed...

86
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,100
But um...

87
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:39,900
Yeah...

88
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,720
I never...

89
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,140
I had never streamed before...

90
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:42,940
And...

91
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,460
Why is...

92
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,800
YouTube broken?

93
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,440
Wait, hold on...

94
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,440
I think YouTube...

95
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,600
Has been broken for a bit...

96
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,260
I think it's been broken...

97
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:09,660
But...

98
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,600
It says I have so many viewers, but I don't think that's the case.

99
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,670
It says I have so many viewers, but I don't think that's the case.

100
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:27,170
I don't think so...

101
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,590
I'm seeing 20...

102
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,470
Yeah, that's too many, I think...

103
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:33,530
That's...

104
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,830
I don't think that's normal...

105
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,210
I think that's actually broken.

106
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:36,350
I think it's broken.

107
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,530
I think that's actually broken.

108
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,130
I don't think it's that many.

109
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,610
I think it's being weird.

110
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,310
I think after the Cloud Strife, it's broken.

111
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,270
I think so.

112
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,710
It is broken!

113
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,460
It's... Anyway.

114
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,220
Welcome.

115
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,620
I'm watching on three devices.

116
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,640
Stop.

117
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,360
Oh my gosh.

118
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,700
If anything, it's too little.

119
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:14,940
No!

120
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,600
I don't want it to be that much.

121
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,240
It's too much.

122
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:25,520
No, I feel much more comfortable if it's just a normal... If it's just a normal map.

123
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,720
Oh gosh.

124
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,200
I have 50 tabs open.

125
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:41,080
Well, for everybody who's real... If you're here... Sorry, my voice is a little hoarse.

126
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,300
Thank you for the peek!

127
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,260
Thank you so much.

128
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,560
My bot farm.

129
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,320
Yeah.

130
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,340
Oh no, my account's gonna get banned.

131
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,040
I'm real.

132
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,120
I'm real!

133
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,400
Yeah, my voice is a little hoarse because I was... I went to an event this weekend, you know.

134
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,640
Will you ever unprivate your first ever bot?

135
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,380
I don't think... I don't know.

136
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,120
You guys even want to hear that?

137
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,080
I... What's the word?

138
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,800
I will be watching it.

139
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,100
I will be watching it.

140
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,560
Oh gosh.

141
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,140
I'm nervous though.

142
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,660
I don't want today's stream to be super duper long.

143
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,840
Yay, Corko!

144
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,620
Thank you for the 50!

145
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,040
Totally not a bot.

146
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,440
Unprivate your intro video.

147
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,000
You're telling me I'm not real?

148
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,720
Oh gosh.

149
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,940
I'm really nervous though.

150
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,720
So today, I have... I have a few things to...

151
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,440
I don't want to say announce.

152
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,580
Maybe... maybe to... to announce briefly.

153
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,180
To briefly... to exclaim?

154
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,160
I have things I want to...

155
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,660
Speak?

156
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,340
To scream?

157
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,380
Just a bot.

158
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,780
Announce to announce.

159
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,440
Yeah.

160
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,500
Basically, I will say something and be like...

161
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,280
Tease?

162
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,900
Tease is a good way, right?

163
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,960
I think tease is a... is a...

164
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,840
Tease.

165
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,500
I have things I would like to tickle you a little bit with.

166
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,980
But I... I don't have so much.

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,200
But after we watch some of my old stuff...

168
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,140
After we watch some of my old stuff, then I will...

169
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,060
I will...

170
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,360
I will announce that and then...

171
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,920
I might do like a little bit of VR and...

172
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,960
Stuff like that.

173
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,160
But it is... it's so crazy that I'm...

174
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,200
It's my first ever...

175
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,800
Anniversary celebration, so...

176
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,740
Anniversary celebration, so...

177
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,620
Yes.

178
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,220
Yes.

179
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,160
And then I also have a little bit of a giveaway.

180
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,180
Which I'm not sure how to do yet because...

181
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,360
I literally received this stuff today.

182
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,020
And I'm like...

183
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,120
I don't know how to distribute it yet.

184
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,360
But...

185
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,040
I was given some stuff to give out today.

186
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,720
Maybe I'll figure out a way.

187
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,400
Maybe we can brainstorm together.

188
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,500
As a group, you know.

189
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,040
Fulton it.

190
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,060
Well, it's not physical.

191
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,500
So I can kind of just, you know...

192
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,180
My ball!

193
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,000
Yeah.

194
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,540
We'll figure out something.

195
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,240
Some...

196
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,380
Oh, gosh.

197
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,220
Oh, gosh.

198
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,960
I'm so...

199
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,580
I'm so nervous.

200
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,720
But...

201
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,150
Shall we just...

202
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,930
Start?

203
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,330
Shall we just...

204
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,970
Rip off the band-aid?

205
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,010
Again, I feel so unprepared.

206
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,090
I feel so unprepared.

207
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,030
Yeah, go ahead.

208
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,430
I'm so nervous.

209
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:54,790
I...

210
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,370
Let's see.

211
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,470
I'm going to my videos.

212
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,910
Actually, let's start with my first ever uploaded video, right?

213
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,290
My intro video, which...

214
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,670
Who...

215
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,490
Who asked me to un-private this?

216
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,990
Oh, my gosh.

217
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:13,650
Okay.

218
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,110
I'm so nervous.

219
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,090
I don't remember...

220
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,350
I kind of remember my intro video because, you know...

221
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,950
I took some...

222
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,330
I took a good amount of time, like...

223
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,850
Editing it and everything like that.

224
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,370
But...

225
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,410
For my first ever stream...

226
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,830
I don't remember that at all.

227
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,030
Like, I remember...

228
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,370
Well, I say at all.

229
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,950
I remember having, like, nothing.

230
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,030
And it being...

231
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,430
It being kind of dumb.

232
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,590
So...

233
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,510
Okay, hold on.

234
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,750
We're going to do this.

235
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,550
And we're going to make me small.

236
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,930
I want to see the cringe.

237
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,470
Oh!

238
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,990
And also, to continue the cringe...

239
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,150
I have a heart rate monitor.

240
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,930
Here, I'll put it down here.

241
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,390
I have a heart rate monitor.

242
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:03,650
For...

243
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,830
When things are too strong.

244
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,730
How does a ghost use a heart rate monitor?

245
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:15,730
Don't ask.

246
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:16,450
Wait.

247
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,530
Is this...

248
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,170
Hold on.

249
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,630
It's a little...

250
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,310
It's a little...

251
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,710
There we go.

252
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,070
Okay.

253
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,350
Oh, god!

254
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,670
Don't worry about it.

255
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:29,970
Okay.

256
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,670
It's like an EMF reader.

257
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,050
True!

258
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,950
True, true, true.

259
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,510
True, true, true, true.

260
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,490
Oh, my gosh.

261
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,630
Fuck...

262
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,470
Fasundo?

263
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,470
I hope I said that right.

264
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,510
Thank you for the birthday gift.

265
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,290
Thank you.

266
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,610
Happy anniversary, boss.

267
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,670
Thank you.

268
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:52,950
Thank you.

269
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,390
Thank you.

270
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:53,810
Thank you.

271
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,050
Thank you.

272
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,850
Thank you, Oh, my gosh.

273
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:07,490
I don't know what to say.

274
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:13,790
I have a letter disease.

275
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,290
Okay!

276
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,350
Thank you.

277
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:19,910
You're welcome.

278
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:20,890
Thank you.

279
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:20,970
You're welcome.

280
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,550
I love 나왔어, and your heart.

281
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:23,610
I experienced a lot of pain over there.

282
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,030
My fortune -telling team won't let me through this time.

283
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,510
Let's all watch together.

284
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,710
I'm gonna put my glasses on though.

285
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,670
Like, you know how...

286
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,470
when there's like a roast, people wear glasses so they don't seem like affected?

287
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,190
That's me right now.

288
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,530
Hennyson, thank you!

289
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,310
Is that Hennyson by Xander?

290
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,050
Thank you so much!

291
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,810
Thank you, thank you.

292
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,450
I'm ready for cringing.

293
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,770
Sorry about that.

294
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,870
If you heard that, that was OBS just stuttering for a second.

295
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,970
If you heard the OBS stuttering, I'm so sorry.

296
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,630
I don't know, everything is wrong with either me or YouTube or what.

297
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,410
Okay, are we ready to cring- Oh god.

298
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,230
Are we ready to cringe?

299
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,730
Oh god, okay, okay.

300
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,750
Happy Anniversary, thank you!

301
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,870
So this was uploaded four years ago.

302
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,810
July 18th...

303
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,190
July 18th, 2020.

304
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,710
I liked my own video!

305
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,590
You know what?

306
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,390
Self-love, maybe.

307
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,470
I just saw it!

308
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,310
Oh my gosh, July 18th, 2020.

309
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,030
So long ago.

310
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,370
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

311
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,470
Oh gosh, you can see my- It's like telling me my next dream is me.

312
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,830
Okay, okay, oh my gosh.

313
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:59,150
Okay.

314
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,010
Okay, okay, okay.

315
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,030
Okay, okay, okay.

316
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,110
Okay.

317
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,370
Three, two, one.

318
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,030
Wait, it's too loud.

319
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,250
Thank you, thank you.

320
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,330
Hi, hello, my name is Mint Phantom.

321
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,270
My name is Mint Phantom.

322
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,310
Welcome to my channel!

323
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,470
Why is there nothing, no audio?

324
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,790
So my name is Mint, I'm forever 19.

325
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,630
I'm forever 19!

326
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,030
I'm an eternal maid.

327
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,050
So just to introduce myself since I'm new.

328
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:44,090
Some things that I really like are idols, anime, horror, bubble tea, and most of all, most of all, most of all, most of all, maids and cute girls.

329
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,190
I sound like I need to clear my throat.

330
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:52,310
Ramen and almond rice, but I really dislike masago and anything spicy.

331
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,130
Nobody cares!

332
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:54,870
I just can't have it.

333
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,790
I'll die.

334
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,290
I'll die again.

335
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,090
I'll die.

336
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:03,230
So when I'm not haunting a maid cafe, I really just like to watch idols and anime.

337
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,150
An idol group I love in particular is Nijinokunki.

338
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,010
Yeah, Nijikan!

339
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,370
And I go watch their music videos.

340
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,830
I got a little freaky there.

341
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,010
I love Zangaran Saga and Ring Hero.

342
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,810
Wow, I still like those.

343
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:22,670
And I basically also have seen basically every episode of Detective Conan.

344
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:23,810
Mintante Conan!

345
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,670
When you're a ghost, you just have so much free time on your hands.

346
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:32,030
So I've never really been good at video games or speaking.

347
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,910
And so I thought...

348
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,210
Why are her hands like that?

349
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,910
So I thought becoming a VTuber would help motivate me to get better about it.

350
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,010
That's how I improved, everybody!

351
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,130
And talk to more people because I'm very shy.

352
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,490
Like, think Boo from Mario.

353
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,610
He's so shy.

354
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:48,990
Censor.

355
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:49,630
That's me.

356
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,730
Don't look at me.

357
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,550
Don't get me.

358
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:56,970
I want to play a lot of horror games even though they really, really do scare me.

359
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,210
I'm going to do my best to...

360
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,590
Don't say limp-wristed.

361
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,550
I think maybe if everyone's there working with me, it won't be so scary.

362
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,950
I'll try to be brave.

363
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:07,470
Yeah.

364
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,810
I think my Japanese is okay.

365
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:10,490
It's okay.

366
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,310
I think I've regressed a little bit.

367
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,330
Nice to meet you.

368
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:14,490
I'm Mintante.

369
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,250
My Japanese is not that good yet.

370
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,970
But I want to talk to everyone.

371
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,050
So I'm going to study every day.

372
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,210
Study every day.

373
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,590
Let's talk every day.

374
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,210
Pre-MGS.

375
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,910
So there's things that I want to do and I hope that I can get better with practice.

376
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,810
Please be patient with me.

377
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,110
I'm a ghost.

378
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,370
I'm haunting.

379
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,890
My full-time haunting.

380
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:46,410
It may take me some time to get used to everything but I look forward to talking with all of you.

381
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:51,290
And I really want to collab with all the other really cute girls.

382
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,390
I do hope that I can learn a lot though.

383
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,050
And also collaborate with other VTubers.

384
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,030
And I hope you're looking forward to my content.

385
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,710
So thank you so much for watching.

386
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,790
And I hope you'll follow me on Twitter.

387
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,570
And subscribe to my channel for future videos.

388
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,370
And yeah.

389
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,450
Thanks for watching.

390
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,510
Thanks for watching.

391
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,570
I don't really know what else to say.

392
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,570
Have I changed?

393
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,090
Okay, bye.

394
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,550
Whoops.

395
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,290
Have I changed at all?

396
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,390
I seem so shy.

397
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,110
I seem so baby.

398
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,110
I'm just like...

399
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,090
My mic changed for sure.

400
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,650
Definitely.

401
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,990
I just peaked at 1.16 when the bikini showed up.

402
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,390
She used to be so cute.

403
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,230
What the?

404
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,910
I'm still kind of cute.

405
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,410
It sounds more relaxed now than she was back then.

406
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,310
I remember recording this in my closet.

407
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,930
I used to have to stream in my closet.

408
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,490
And I do remember recording this.

409
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,930
And I...

410
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,930
I don't even...

411
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,670
I was so nervous, you know.

412
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,490
I was like...

413
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,870
I never made a video like this before.

414
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,190
So I was...

415
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,970
I didn't even know.

416
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,310
I didn't even know.

417
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:21,590
So...

418
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,330
Mata loves me.

419
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,550
Mata!

420
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,110
Before Zanzibar.

421
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,710
Is Mata here?

422
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:33,090
Hello.

423
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:33,450
Oh!

424
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,270
Roachmomrid!

425
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,750
Hello!

426
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,750
Hello, hello!

427
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,490
Oh, man.

428
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,550
That wasn't so bad.

429
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,890
There were some things I remembered.

430
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:45,550
The...

431
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,030
Don't look at me.

432
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:47,490
Look at me.

433
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,830
It was like kind of an inside joke between me and some friends.

434
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:52,870
So...

435
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,170
So that's why I remember it.

436
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,630
Because I would just be like...

437
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,670
Basically, I would say like...

438
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,290
For my waifu and stuff, I would be like...

439
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,130
Don't look at her.

440
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:02,990
Because she's my waifu.

441
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:03,810
But then I'd be like...

442
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,230
Look at her.

443
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,110
Because, you know...

444
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:05,790
She's...

445
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,430
I want everybody to look at how cute my waifu is.

446
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,250
So I'd say...

447
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,090
Don't look at me.

448
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:10,990
Look at me.

449
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,450
Don't look at her.

450
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,370
Look at her.

451
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,450
So that's...

452
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,410
That's where that kind of came from.

453
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,410
And then...

454
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,050
Let's see.

455
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:20,810
Let's see.

456
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,950
This part is so awkward.

457
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:33,230
I think I was truly just too lazy to edit in any sound effects at that moment.

458
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,050
But this is all the same stuff.

459
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:35,690
Things that...

460
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,250
Why did I make a list of my likes but I didn't make a list of my dislikes?

461
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,070
I only said it.

462
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,050
Koine!

463
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,670
Thank you for the 50!

464
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,350
Thank you!

465
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:44,450
Pusha!

466
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,010
Pusha!

467
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,370
And...

468
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,770
But I still like idols.

469
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,230
I still like anime, I still like horror, I still like bubble tea, I still like moe things!

470
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,070
I think everything is the same.

471
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,430
Oh, I left a space here!

472
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,730
I left a space here for Metal Gear!

473
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,230
Maybe.

474
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,750
It's a good one actually, I'll write that down.

475
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,950
But yeah, there's a room here for Metal Gear.

476
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,430
It was foretold!

477
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,170
Hold on, I can even add it!

478
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,450
I can add it right now!

479
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,210
I'm rewriting history!

480
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,020
Metal Gear...

481
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,000
What's this font that I used?

482
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,640
This was on my laptop, I don't think I have it anymore.

483
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,200
Oh no!

484
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,660
It was on my laptop.

485
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,620
I don't think I have it anymore.

486
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,280
Wait.

487
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,260
Maybe?

488
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,460
No way.

489
00:24:59,520 --> 00:24:59,980
It's...

490
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,160
Close enough.

491
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,770
It looks pretty close!

492
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:14,990
I wonder if it's... wait.

493
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,410
It looks a little bolded.

494
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,910
Galaxy, thank you so much!

495
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,030
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

496
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,270
Wait.

497
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:24,650
Maru?

498
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:26,290
Normal.

499
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,050
Maru?

500
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,170
It looks the same to me.

501
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:28,910
Anyway.

502
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,470
I've rewritten history.

503
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,030
Let's see what else was here.

504
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,590
Have you guys seen...

505
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,550
Here, I'll show you the...

506
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,490
I'll show you what the...

507
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,150
The quick...

508
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,490
Here, let's watch it in slow-mo.

509
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,430
So we can get that...

510
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,030
I also uploaded this at 720p.

511
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,250
If you're like, oh, she looks a little fuzzy.

512
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,270
Yeah.

513
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,470
Because I'm an idiot.

514
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,990
It's at 720p.

515
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,650
So this is Nijin no Konkisudo.

516
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,630
They're an idol group and I still like them very much.

517
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,110
But let's go to that .25 playback.

518
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,570
Oh my god.

519
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,970
I even missed it.

520
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:18,150
So...

521
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,850
Yeah, you should go watch their music video.

522
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:25,250
I'm sorry.

523
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,250
It doesn't sound so good.

524
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,970
You should go watch their music video.

525
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,110
Mm-hmm.

526
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:32,910
Mm-hmm.

527
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:33,110
Mm -hmm.

528
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,410
Mm-hmm.

529
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,970
Mm -hmm.

530
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,170
Mm -hmm.

531
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,330
Mm -hmm.

532
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,360
Oh my goodness.

533
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,000
Let's see.

534
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,440
What else did I talk about in here?

535
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,340
Zombieland Saga and ReZero.

536
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,580
I still very much like both of those.

537
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,880
And then I talk about Conan too.

538
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,080
But I have not watched.

539
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,780
I'm behind.

540
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,320
I'm behind on Metante Conan.

541
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,760
I'm not...

542
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,460
I'm not...

543
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,700
I'm way behind, actually.

544
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,160
I'm way, way, way behind.

545
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,180
What is this?

546
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,260
Oh, so I thought counter.

547
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,420
I'm very shy.

548
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,480
I think that's still the same.

549
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,640
I want to play horror games.

550
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,280
But I don't know.

551
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:35,360
I'm scared.

552
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,900
But I'm scared.

553
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,160
And then I talk in Japanese.

554
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:37,620
Nihongo.

555
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,220
Um...

556
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,680
Mint brain goes brrrrr.

557
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,340
Um, thank you for the vibe gifted.

558
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,640
You've gotten better with your shyness.

559
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,120
You think so?

560
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,140
You think so?

561
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,380
Oh, thanks so much for watching.

562
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,100
And then it goes shoooooo.

563
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,820
Oh my gosh.

564
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,660
The next part is the one I'm really scared about.

565
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,340
Shady, thank you for the Hakusopa.

566
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,260
Can't wait to see next video.

567
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,360
It's the next year's anniversary where you react to your react to your intro video.

568
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:17,740
No, this is the part that I... we're going into un... into territory that I do not remember.

569
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,880
This is my... it'll be my first ever... first ever stream.

570
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:33,940
We're not gonna watch all of it, but um... but uh... we will watch something.

571
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,440
Hold on, I have to scroll all the way to the end.

572
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,020
There we go.

573
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,420
Um, the first.

574
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,700
Oh my gosh.

575
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,440
I don't remember anything that happens in this.

576
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,840
Okay, hold on.

577
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,900
Ta-Dah!

578
00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:02,260
The first- The first ever!

579
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,240
NEVER Ever Ever Next life ever lives.

580
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,520
Ever, ever.

581
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,700
And that's the date.

582
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,540
Oh,

583
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,860
I can't read the comments because they're like...

584
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,500
It says you can't for... Oh, thank goodness.

585
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,160
I did not like my own livestream.

586
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,680
But you can't see it on private videos, which is kind of sad.

587
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,660
I don't know how this is so...

588
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,640
But also, I think maybe I should set the mood a little bit.

589
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,880
Give me one second.

590
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,800
Give me one second.

591
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,380
I think I hear my computer.

592
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,740
Wait, where is this?

593
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,040
Here we go.

594
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,580
Here we go.

595
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:02,960
Here we go.

596
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,340
Here we go.

597
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:03,680
Here we go.

598
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,080
One second.

599
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:05,720
Oh, wait.

600
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,220
One second.

601
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,600
One second.

602
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,580
One second.

603
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:08,940
One second.

604
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,400
One second.

605
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:09,720
One second.

606
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,740
One second.

607
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,440
One second.

608
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:11,600
One second.

609
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:11,760
One second.

610
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,420
Oh my gosh.

611
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,060
What is wrong with me?

612
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,640
Why did I size it like this?

613
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,920
Are you kidding me?

614
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,700
Past Minto, what's wrong with you?

615
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,280
Okay.

616
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,720
And then...

617
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,530
There we go.

618
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,930
I still have all my old graphics.

619
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:38,850
Isn't that kind of crazy?

620
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,090
I still have all of them.

621
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,150
Here, we'll get rid of the disc too.

622
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,410
I keep basically everything.

623
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:54,130
I keep almost everything because I am a hoarder and a freak.

624
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:54,890
Maybe.

625
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:59,630
I still have almost, I think, all of my old, like, thumbnails even.

626
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,150
Like this one.

627
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,930
I tried to do an 8-hour endurance stream.

628
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,650
This is the thumbnail, right?

629
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,110
But it kept... Look at that.

630
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,430
Thank you for 3,000.

631
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,430
That's what it says.

632
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:16,690
But YouTube did not like the booba part, so I had to, like...

633
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,170
I had to censor it.

634
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,970
It's called 8-hour thumbnail FFS.

635
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:33,190
Because I was getting so frustrated at the fact that it was not allowing me to use the thumbnail.

636
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,370
Let's see.

637
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,230
Here...

638
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,490
We have 1,000 subs, Minto.

639
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,130
Thank you everybody for...

640
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,910
Why do I look like that?

641
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,610
It looks like I wasn't ready for the photo.

642
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,370
It looks like I'm not ready for the photo.

643
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,570
Let's see.

644
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,530
I have so much stuff.

645
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:54,810
Look!

646
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:59,490
Even that you saw in the other thing, my likes and my dislikes, here it is.

647
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,290
It's the graphic.

648
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,150
You blinked.

649
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,490
I blinked.

650
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,030
I still keep everything.

651
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,470
I'm not even kidding.

652
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,330
I have every... I think... I have so much here.

653
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,170
I have everything here.

654
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:13,850
No way!

655
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:14,650
I know!

656
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,270
Add Metal Gear to the list.

657
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,450
I should.

658
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:18,890
I should.

659
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,010
I have, like, almost all of my old schedules.

660
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,650
Let's see what I did.

661
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:26,070
Here.

662
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,010
I'm just gonna put on some BGM.

663
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,350
Since I'm talking a little bit before we get into the...

664
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,090
Into the stream.

665
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,550
Into my first ever...

666
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,050
I almost said Haishin.

667
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,450
Let's see.

668
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:44,930
What did I do on January 4th through January 10th?

669
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,150
Done.

670
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,990
I played Slither.io.

671
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,070
And I played Among Us.

672
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,630
And I finished Ace Attorney.

673
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,030
And then I did a game collab.

674
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,390
Look at this schedule.

675
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:07,210
I only would stream a couple days a week because I did...

676
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:07,870
I mentioned it.

677
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:08,950
I had a full-time haunting.

678
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,190
So...

679
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,810
Let's see.

680
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:12,430
What did I do?

681
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,390
November 23rd.

682
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:15,990
Done.

683
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,630
I played Doom.

684
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,790
I played Doom for the first time.

685
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,570
And I played Pacify with Maria.

686
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,150
And Phasmophobia.

687
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,090
And Among Us with Chat.

688
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,910
Nothing is Chase.

689
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,910
Oh my goodness.

690
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:42,230
Wow.

691
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,030
I wonder when you finish Doom.

692
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:46,390
Yeah.

693
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,830
And I went through...

694
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,930
Let's see.

695
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:52,570
Um...

696
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:54,710
Uh...

697
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,270
I had like special things too.

698
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,110
Like...

699
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,490
Like 3k subs.

700
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,970
I did an endurance stream.

701
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,750
And I did...

702
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,350
I don't remember playing Ao Oni.

703
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,850
I don't remember ever playing that game.

704
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,270
Did I actually play that?

705
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,390
Then I played Touhou Mountain of Faith.

706
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,270
I did Jackbox with the FanDome.

707
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,550
Aka you guys, the Wisps.

708
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,250
Getting Over It.

709
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:20,750
Karaoke.

710
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:21,290
Free Chat.

711
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:21,870
Marshmallow.

712
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,170
Time to play again.

713
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,010
Touhou Mansion.

714
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:32,930
So...

715
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,270
Touhou Mansion.

716
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:36,970
Yeah.

717
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:38,250
Love Touhou.

718
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:41,930
So yeah.

719
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:42,550
I...

720
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,190
Oh my gosh.

721
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:48,490
You know what's even crazier is I have like the files.

722
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,350
I have the PSDs of these schedules as well.

723
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:54,150
So I could just totally redo them if I ever wanted to.

724
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,230
Isn't that so wild?

725
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,290
And then this was before.

726
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,790
This was the schedule when I was reviewing how I look now.

727
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,210
So cute.

728
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,570
I played Sonic.

729
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,770
I played Sonic.

730
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,430
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

731
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,450
Why don't I have Monday on here?

732
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,490
If I already have break and break...

733
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,130
Why don't I have Monday on here?

734
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:35,290
Maybe I didn't... Maybe I took Mondays off every time, because full-time haunting plus, you know, I don't want to... I don't want to work on... I don't want to go do Monday work and then also stream Monday.

735
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:37,790
Garfield rep.

736
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,250
Garfield rep, truly.

737
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,950
Six boxes look nice too?

738
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,410
You think so?

739
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,250
I thought it was a little difficult to read.

740
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,150
Because... here, hold on.

741
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,250
Oh, yeah.

742
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,790
Oh, you're so probably right.

743
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,110
Right?

744
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:55,450
Yeah.

745
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,690
If it was seven boxes, that wouldn't make much sense.

746
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:02,430
Yeah, so just having the six box, but it's hard to read, right?

747
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,510
Because you have to go...

748
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,530
Like you have to zigzag through it.

749
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:07,530
It's hard to read.

750
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,410
Doing it in the lines.

751
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,190
I don't know.

752
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,030
I always struggled with my schedule.

753
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,050
You played Sonic on Mario Day?

754
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,090
Wait, when did I play it?

755
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:23,730
When did I play it?

756
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:25,910
No way.

757
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:29,870
Oh my gosh, I'm such a hater.

758
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:32,750
Wait.

759
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,250
8, 9, 10.

760
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:34,790
No!

761
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:35,730
No!

762
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,430
I played it on the 11th.

763
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,150
I played it March 11th.

764
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,990
8, 9, 10, 11.

765
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:46,730
Barely safe.

766
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,770
You got a horrible case of the Mondays.

767
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:51,210
It's true.

768
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,210
Saved.

769
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,730
I'm a tired.

770
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,030
I'm a tired.

771
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,550
Mario Day in Asia.

772
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,990
No, I streamed it the day after.

773
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,310
It would have been Mario Day...

774
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:15,510
It would have been the day after Mario Day in Asia.

775
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,590
So close to being a certified Chris Pratt hater.

776
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:22,950
You're right.

777
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:24,550
Alrighty, guys.

778
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,710
Are we ready for this?

779
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:26,570
I'm not.

780
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,910
Why did I put... Why did I lift my...

781
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:29,550
Oh, gosh.

782
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,690
I think I'm just gonna... Oh, gosh.

783
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:33,930
Oh, gosh.

784
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:34,730
Thank you.

785
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:35,610
You're a soup.

786
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,270
Thank you.

787
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:42,540
Okay.

788
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,600
Sorry if you can hear so much noise.

789
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,740
I think the fan is going a little bit crazy.

790
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:47,940
But...

791
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,960
And also, my cat, she keeps jumping on my desk and ruining my cables.

792
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,140
Rip the Band-Aid off.

793
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:55,540
Okay.

794
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,060
Okay.

795
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,420
Okay.

796
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:56,720
Okay.

797
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,300
Okay.

798
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:57,840
Okay.

799
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,160
Okay.

800
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,320
Okay.

801
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,480
Okay.

802
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,410
I still use this PGM.

803
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:08,250
I didn't realize I used it for my starting screen as well.

804
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,330
I didn't...

805
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,370
I didn't realize I used it for my starting screen as well.

806
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,470
I made this though, right?

807
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,110
I just was like, meow.

808
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,470
I made my starting students screen.

809
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:23,910
Please wait a little.

810
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,050
Louder?

811
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:30,130
No.

812
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:31,710
Okay.

813
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,210
I'm gonna skip.

814
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:32,890
Oh, gosh.

815
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,410
Oh, gosh.

816
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,270
Oh, gosh.

817
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,650
Oh, gosh.

818
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:36,290
Oh, gosh.

819
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:36,590
Oh, gosh.

820
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,370
Oh, gosh.

821
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:39,870
Oh, gosh.

822
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:40,190
Oh, gosh.

823
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:40,270
Oh, gosh.

824
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:40,410
Oh, gosh.

825
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:40,430
Oh, gosh.

826
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:40,850
Oh, gosh.

827
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:40,850
Oh, gosh.

828
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:40,870
Cherry.

829
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:41,490
Gary.

830
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:42,450
Thanks for the 50.

831
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,710
I look like I don't know where I am.

832
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,010
Why am I not saying anything?

833
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,590
Mint, say something.

834
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:01,410
Hello?

835
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,950
I can hear...

836
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,170
Do you guys hear that?

837
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,770
Do you guys hear the...

838
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,390
Sage, right?

839
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,070
Do you guys hear the...

840
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,790
It's my laptop fan.

841
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:18,570
Oh, my God.

842
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:19,850
Hello?

843
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:21,710
Hello?

844
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:23,690
Hello?

845
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,510
Hello?

846
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,530
Can you hear me?

847
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:26,930
Oh, girly.

848
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,630
Yes, we can.

849
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:37,310
The screen is moving so fast.

850
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:38,730
Hello?

851
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:39,270
Hi.

852
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:40,850
Toaster mic.

853
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:41,850
Welcome back.

854
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,330
Oh, my God.

855
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,530
It sounds so awful.

856
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:45,890
Hi.

857
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:46,370
Hello.

858
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,680
It sounds so different.

859
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,420
There are so many people.

860
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,300
Oh, my God.

861
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,100
It sounds okay.

862
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,400
It sounds... Am I good?

863
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,920
It sounds like I'm on Xbox.

864
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:09,720
I'm alive.

865
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,580
I'm alive.

866
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,240
I'm here.

867
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,280
I'm not alive.

868
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,720
What are you talking about?

869
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,580
Minto.

870
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,040
I'm gonna skip.

871
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:16,980
First donation.

872
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:17,500
Oh, no.

873
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,440
Is my mic bad?

874
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,320
Oh.

875
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,250
I'm shaking.

876
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:30,730
Oh, no.

877
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:31,490
Is my mic...

878
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,590
You guys, is my mic bad?

879
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,090
Thank you.

880
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,170
Thank you for coming.

881
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,210
Oh, my gosh.

882
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,730
There are so many people.

883
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:38,730
I think...

884
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,630
I think...

885
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:44,430
I don't remember how many people were watching at the time.

886
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,590
Do you still have this mic?

887
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,230
I don't.

888
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,610
Because you know what this mic was?

889
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:48,770
It actually was a headset.

890
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:49,870
And I...

891
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,150
Oh.

892
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,090
That...

893
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:51,290
Oh.

894
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:51,870
I...

895
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:51,890
I...

896
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:52,050
I...

897
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:52,090
I...

898
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:52,130
I...

899
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,150
I was gonna...

900
00:40:54,150 --> 00:41:00,970
I was going to buy the same headset that I had for this stream right now to kind of recreate the moment.

901
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:08,650
But because of everything that happened, because of all the plane stuff, I wasn't able to.

902
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:09,690
So...

903
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,630
You sound like you're in a COD lobby.

904
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:12,010
I know.

905
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,710
But this was actually a headset.

906
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,290
I thought that maybe...

907
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:24,110
I knew nothing about mics or anything like that, so I thought that maybe having a headset would be fine audio quality.

908
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:24,650
But...

909
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:26,850
For...

910
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,110
I don't remember what mic I used.

911
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:33,730
I think I used like the AT2020, which I also still have for my...

912
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:38,030
And like I use an interface for my intro video.

913
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:39,770
So...

914
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,310
I don't...

915
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:49,490
Toaster Mike!

916
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,290
There's probably like no names in this chat.

917
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,010
Wait!

918
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,930
I recognize people!

919
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,570
Toaster Mike!

920
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,330
What does that mean?

921
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,970
There's still some people I recognize.

922
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:05,270
People are already roasting my mic.

923
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:05,950
I'm sorry.

924
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:06,430
I'm sorry.

925
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:06,810
Here.

926
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:07,250
Let me...

927
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,010
Oh my god.

928
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:09,490
I'm sorry.

929
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:16,190
But probably nobody here in this chat watches me or even knows about me anymore.

930
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:17,990
No.

931
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:22,930
I'm sorry.

932
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:23,490
I'm sorry.

933
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:24,430
I'm looking at the names.

934
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:24,930
I'm sorry.

935
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:25,990
She sounds so different.

936
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:26,770
I know, right?

937
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:27,730
It's kind of crazy.

938
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:30,610
Hello.

939
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:31,930
Hello.

940
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:33,370
Hello.

941
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:35,710
ASMR.

942
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,050
I don't...

943
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:37,370
I...

944
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:38,950
I found you a little later.

945
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:39,990
I never thought about doing ASMR.

946
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:40,990
Honestly.

947
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,050
I don't know...

948
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,550
This is like...

949
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:43,830
This...

950
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:44,030
Okay.

951
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:44,890
You guys.

952
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,070
This is my first...

953
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,630
This is my introduction to...

954
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,530
To everybody.

955
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,170
This is my introduction stream!

956
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:53,450
Also 200 people at my debut.

957
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:54,910
I had 200 people at my debut.

958
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:56,150
I'm nervous as heck.

959
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:56,750
I was there.

960
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:57,810
Los arurus!

961
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:58,230
Gracias!

962
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:06,130
But 200 people watching me on my debut.

963
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:09,090
And it was so much.

964
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,430
It was so much.

965
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:15,730
My little ghost heart couldn't handle it.

966
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,510
This is my first introduction.

967
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,430
I'm making a fool of myself, truly.

968
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,770
I can't really do it seriously.

969
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,930
The mic sounds different from the trailer.

970
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,850
I can't believe there's so many people in here.

971
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:37,250
The mic I'm using now is a different mic from my video.

972
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,250
I sound so sad.

973
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,050
Wait.

974
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:43,090
So apologetic back then.

975
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,490
Now she openly hates us.

976
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:45,950
Wait, wait.

977
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:47,390
No!

978
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:50,130
Was that a donation?

979
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:50,590
What?

980
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:52,530
No, no, no.

981
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:59,770
I kind of... the old donation sound is so nostalgic.

982
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,310
Was that a donation?

983
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:07,910
Was that a super chat?

984
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,050
Oh my gosh!

985
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:13,730
Alina, thank you so much for the hookers over there.

986
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:13,930
Thank you.

987
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:17,070
Wait, maybe that makes it a little spooky, right?

988
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:17,690
Right?

989
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:18,910
A dead mic?

990
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,010
A dead mic?

991
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:23,890
I don't even know how to sound like this anymore.

992
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:25,830
There's so many people.

993
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:27,190
Donation.

994
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,370
No, no, no.

995
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,370
So cute.

996
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,370
A little gif.

997
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:33,910
Not me.

998
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:34,910
No, don't.

999
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:35,950
No, no, no.

1000
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,510
Okay, I can't deal with this anymore.

1001
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:38,970
Please continue forward.

1002
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:43,910
Okay, so I know I answered some marshmallows and stuff.

1003
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,790
Let's see what questions people asked of me.

1004
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:45,990
Oh.

1005
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:51,930
This one was if I worked at the Scarlet Devil Mansion.

1006
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:53,770
Kawaii.

1007
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:54,770
Saiko kawaii.

1008
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:56,010
Really.

1009
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:57,510
Marshmallow.

1010
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,110
So, uh, yes.

1011
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:01,190
I would work there.

1012
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:02,170
What?

1013
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:04,670
Photos.

1014
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:13,150
0, 3, 7, E, 1, 9, 0, 5, 8, 5, 2, D, 4, 1, 7, E, B, F, F, A, 1, B, F, 0, 1, D, 6, 8, 6, 6, 9, 8.

1015
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:13,690
That PNG.

1016
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,780
The main mint shirt I ordered in mint color just showed up!

1017
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,560
Oh my god!

1018
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,120
Let's go.

1019
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:39,280
I was given a 4 hour work commute this week and I've been listening to the podcast during the drive so I wanted to say thank you to you and Manta for saving my life.

1020
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,040
Oh my gosh, Serval.

1021
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,300
Stop.

1022
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,080
But good luck with your drive and everything.

1023
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,840
4 hour work commute.

1024
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:45,380
That's insane.

1025
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,620
Working at the STM?

1026
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,420
That's for fairy maids though, not you?

1027
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:53,380
Hey.

1028
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,620
I could.

1029
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,700
This is soul.

1030
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,760
Let's see, what other questions?

1031
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,400
Oh my gosh.

1032
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,120
Okay.

1033
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:05,880
PC.

1034
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,800
I sound so quiet!

1035
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,180
People are gonna listen to this.

1036
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,080
You guys are gonna listen to this and be like, where'd she go?

1037
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,020
What happened to her?

1038
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,080
My gaming laptop?

1039
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,180
What happened to her?

1040
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:32,560
So, I didn't really play a lot of games on PC so I played more on console.

1041
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,420
Is it quiet though?

1042
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,140
Can you hear it?

1043
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,980
Actually, probably better you can't.

1044
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:40,000
Oh my god, I can hear my laptop.

1045
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,700
Oh, I see other people like Touhou.

1046
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,200
Yay!

1047
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,800
Sakuya's gonna be jealous.

1048
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,700
The breathing.

1049
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,560
You've changed.

1050
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,200
No!

1051
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,360
I haven't changed!

1052
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,040
I haven't changed!

1053
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:56,520
Yeah.

1054
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,000
Touhou.

1055
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,340
You can hear the fuzz, can't you?

1056
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,380
Wouldn't you want to work with Yuyuko instead?

1057
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,100
Maybe.

1058
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,100
But I think Yomu is just...

1059
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,540
I think if I were too close to Yomu, I'd be...

1060
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,500
I'd die again.

1061
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,840
Because she's so cute.

1062
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,900
This mic makes me sound so strange.

1063
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,940
But my favorite Touhou's actually are Remilia Ojousama.

1064
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,680
My favorite Touhou is Remilia Ojousama.

1065
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,220
I don't know.

1066
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:17,700
Kokasa.

1067
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:18,140
Yeah.

1068
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,840
How do I sound like that?

1069
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,140
Um...

1070
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,100
What's the game?

1071
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,040
What's the game?

1072
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,020
How do I sound like that?

1073
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,380
UFO?

1074
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,240
Yeah, yeah.

1075
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,220
Right, yeah.

1076
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,200
Right, yeah.

1077
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,700
I sound kinda like a valley girl.

1078
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,300
My favorite game is Mountain of Faith.

1079
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,760
How do I sound like that?

1080
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:36,400
So...

1081
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,000
I would play...

1082
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,460
I'd play on my Switch.

1083
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,860
I'd play on my Switch.

1084
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,460
And next.

1085
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,960
You sound so cute back there.

1086
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:46,320
Okay.

1087
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,140
I still sound cute though, right?

1088
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,460
How old are you?

1089
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,780
I'm forever 19.

1090
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,320
How tall are you?

1091
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,160
Uh...

1092
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,020
I'm about a hundred and thirty-five centimeters.

1093
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,280
So...

1094
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,440
Thank you so much.

1095
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:00,800
What is that?

1096
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,060
Like almost five feet?

1097
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,260
Hmm...

1098
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:03,720
Um...

1099
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,100
Do you like playing horror games?

1100
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:05,800
No.

1101
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:06,760
But yes.

1102
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,500
Happy anniversary.

1103
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,520
Thank you.

1104
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:08,700
Are you a gamer?

1105
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,060
I'm kind of a gamer.

1106
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,260
Is there someone you know in Vtuber?

1107
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,240
Like my favorite Vtuber?

1108
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,660
Is that what that means?

1109
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,520
My favorite Vtuber?

1110
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:16,740
Um...

1111
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,380
Because...

1112
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,760
I wonder who I answer here.

1113
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,300
Favorite of all time?

1114
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,100
It's really difficult.

1115
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:22,620
Maybe...

1116
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:23,080
I'm a gamer.

1117
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,020
Are you a gamer?

1118
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:25,500
Yeah.

1119
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,260
Shiro-chan?

1120
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,500
Do you guys know Denou Shoujo Shiro?

1121
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:28,820
Oh!

1122
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:29,760
Denou Shoujo Shiro?

1123
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:30,720
Do you guys know?

1124
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:31,980
Kaguya Luna.

1125
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,600
Do you guys know Denou Shoujo Shiro?

1126
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,320
I watch...

1127
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:38,780
I actually...

1128
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,760
I think probably around this time, I watched a lot of her.

1129
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,440
I think her...

1130
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,360
Also...

1131
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:44,600
Uh...

1132
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,220
Well...

1133
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,700
Actually, I don't remember when I first started Himehina.

1134
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,280
Yeah.

1135
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:50,840
Yeah, the dolphin.

1136
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1137
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:54,900
Kaguya Luna.

1138
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:55,720
Shiro mentioned.

1139
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,280
Wow!

1140
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:56,880
Wait, wait.

1141
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,980
I wonder if I mentioned anyone else.

1142
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:58,760
She's so cute.

1143
00:48:58,820 --> 00:48:59,320
She's so cute.

1144
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,400
My emo...

1145
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:01,800
Or my...

1146
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,080
Notice just covering my face.

1147
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:03,760
Oh!

1148
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:04,340
Nope.

1149
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:04,960
That's it.

1150
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,320
I don't talk about that anymore.

1151
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,480
I don't talk about that anymore.

1152
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:11,920
How do I sound like this though?

1153
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,240
So, um...

1154
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,800
My name is Mint Phantom.

1155
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:16,880
Um...

1156
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,700
Hello?

1157
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:18,560
Wait.

1158
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:19,720
I'm sorry.

1159
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:19,740
I'm sorry.

1160
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:19,780
I'm sorry.

1161
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,320
Hello?

1162
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:31,820
If people reincarnate after their passing, if people, if, if, if people reincarnate after their passing, try to be quiet.

1163
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,460
If people reincarnate after their passing...

1164
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,940
And, oh, wait, I forgot to...

1165
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:38,820
There was something else.

1166
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,040
Oh, thank you you, Mr. Master.

1167
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:41,800
Thank you.

1168
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,480
And it's okay.

1169
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,860
You didn't ask too much.

1170
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,120
Can you do the breathy?

1171
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:52,760
If people reincarnate after their passing, and those who still have something to say, Make your voice softer.

1172
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,280
What is your grudge?

1173
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,700
So, I actually don't really...

1174
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,840
remember much of before I was alive.

1175
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,520
I remember.

1176
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:11,490
I remember.

1177
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:16,550
But I'm saving that for another day!

1178
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,330
Saving that for another day, baby.

1179
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:24,370
So, actually, nothing.

1180
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,470
I just remember that I...

1181
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:28,130
Fireball bitch!

1182
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:29,390
What's the word?

1183
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:31,070
Oh my gosh, thank you!

1184
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:34,210
I liked idols, and I liked maids.

1185
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:37,030
And so I just brought that with me.

1186
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:39,330
Johnny, thank you so much for the 50!

1187
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:40,570
My grudge?

1188
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:41,490
My grudge?

1189
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:47,070
From what I remember, it's that I never took that one checky with my oshi.

1190
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:51,530
And so, now I'll never be able to take the checky with my oshi!

1191
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:54,470
This is too real.

1192
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:56,190
Why you gotta be like that?

1193
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:57,490
Why are people saying small?

1194
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:57,970
Me?

1195
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:58,970
Am I small?

1196
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:00,910
No, no, no.

1197
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:03,450
I am not small.

1198
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:04,770
I am ghost.

1199
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:08,430
She's so real!

1200
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:11,430
Hello, miss.

1201
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:15,730
If it's not a rude question to ask a lady, when and how did you become a ghost?

1202
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:17,150
She's so me!

1203
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:21,770
The question everyone wants to know.

1204
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:23,870
How did I become a ghost?

1205
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:33,650
I really, like I said, I really don't remember much, but I do remember this.

1206
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:35,130
Little I remember.

1207
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:36,650
No, stop saying small.

1208
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:37,750
I am not small.

1209
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,150
I am not small.

1210
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:39,890
I am not small.

1211
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:41,410
No.

1212
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:43,570
I am not small.

1213
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:46,630
Stop saying small.

1214
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:53,210
Do you guys know what a checky is?

1215
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:57,030
A checky is not small, just ghost.

1216
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:01,830
But a checky is a polaroid picture.

1217
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:02,770
Stop saying small.

1218
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:08,250
Very popular at maid cafes and idol concerts.

1219
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:09,570
Stop saying small.

1220
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:11,250
Yes.

1221
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:14,250
Stop saying small.

1222
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:15,230
How did I die?

1223
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:17,010
How did I become a ghost?

1224
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:27,710
So, you know, I have a regret with not being able to take the checky with my idol and my idol, my very best idol, my kamiyoshi.

1225
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:28,670
My kamiyoshi.

1226
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:33,970
She announced her graduation and so I died of a broken heart.

1227
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:42,550
But now, I can go and haunt maid cafes and idol concerts and they don't really notice me.

1228
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:45,470
But it's sad because I can't take checkies because of it.

1229
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:47,490
So, I get sad.

1230
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:49,750
Old mean tall.

1231
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,510
What kind of a ghost am I?

1232
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:52,670
What do you mean?

1233
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:53,350
Old mean tall.

1234
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:55,250
Small.

1235
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:56,250
Stop!

1236
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:57,950
Just ghost.

1237
00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:59,090
You're embarrassing me.

1238
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:01,330
You're embarrassing me.

1239
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:01,710
Next.

1240
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:09,330
You are one of the cutest ghosts that I am not scared of as long as you don't haunt me.

1241
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:10,290
I haunt you.

1242
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:13,570
I don't know who you are but I'm going to haunt you now.

1243
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:13,870
It's true.

1244
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:14,490
I haunt.

1245
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:14,990
I haunt.

1246
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:15,370
I haunt.

1247
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:16,950
You can't stop it.

1248
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:21,010
My question is, what made you decide to use ghost as an inspiration for your avatar?

1249
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:22,810
You can't stop it.

1250
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:23,610
You can't stop it.

1251
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:24,810
You can't stop the haunt.

1252
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:26,750
One second.

1253
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:28,250
One second.

1254
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:31,190
I died because of a mint overdose.

1255
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:34,150
Are you guys enjoying this watch along?

1256
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:35,810
You know.

1257
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:37,670
What's my favorite ice cream?

1258
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:38,710
I answer so many things.

1259
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:41,170
I

1260
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,840
really like ice cream so maybe cookies and cream.

1261
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:51,740
Yes!

1262
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,400
It's true!

1263
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,160
That's still the same.

1264
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,200
Next.

1265
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,700
If you were to serve someone forever, who would it be?

1266
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,440
That's a really hard one.

1267
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,300
First time I watched it was during an emergency Among Us with Artemis.

1268
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:07,480
Oh wait.

1269
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:07,880
Emergency.

1270
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,060
I'm trying to think of like characters that have been a hell of a ride getting your box.

1271
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,860
Like maids with them.

1272
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:14,260
Thank you!

1273
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,300
Thank you so much.

1274
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,540
Because if they have maids with them like I get it better.

1275
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,720
How do I sound like this?

1276
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,120
Hello everybody.

1277
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,640
You may not know me.

1278
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,680
But I know you.

1279
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:37,230
I always just have this like lead paint stare going on.

1280
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:38,710
I always just have this like lead paint stare going on.

1281
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,290
I just...

1282
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,400
Just got that lead paint stare going on.

1283
00:54:54,680 --> 00:55:00,500
Why her arms like that?

1284
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,660
Could we get over this please?

1285
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,980
Staring into our soul.

1286
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,480
I can wink.

1287
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,120
I can kinda wink.

1288
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,960
How does it feel?

1289
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,620
How does it feel to be basically back in 2021?

1290
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,800
Wait.

1291
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,740
How...

1292
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:29,940
How does it feel to be back in 2021?

1293
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:31,240
2020?

1294
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:31,500
2020.

1295
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,560
My hands are like this because I'm a ghost.

1296
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,060
I'll show you guys my whole model.

1297
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,940
I'm not very...

1298
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:48,060
These are my shoes.

1299
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,960
Look at that.

1300
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:56,000
I can't really move so much because back... Look at my skirt barely flows at all.

1301
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,780
My legs barely flow at all.

1302
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,900
Back then...

1303
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,080
Back then...

1304
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,640
You know, Vtubers were stiff people.

1305
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,400
We were stiff, stiff as a board.

1306
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,060
And um...

1307
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,420
You can see...

1308
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,440
I can barely move.

1309
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,040
I'm so, so stiff.

1310
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,660
Do before... after comparison.

1311
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:22,460
Actually...

1312
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,280
How do I do that?

1313
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:24,920
Hold on.

1314
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:25,660
There is a way.

1315
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:26,780
One second.

1316
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:27,300
Hold on.

1317
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,400
There's a thing I can do.

1318
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:29,920
Hold on.

1319
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,280
Actually, I think I can do this.

1320
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:34,520
Actually, I think I can do this.

1321
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:36,060
Maybe.

1322
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:38,860
Uh...

1323
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,020
Uh...

1324
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,700
Chat, hold!

1325
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,180
Crazy what four years can do to a Vtuber.

1326
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:46,940
I know, right?

1327
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,260
But um...

1328
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:50,160
Let's see.

1329
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,240
If I do this...

1330
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:53,760
Um...

1331
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:54,860
This?

1332
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,420
Actually, give me one second.

1333
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,460
I'm gonna disappear again.

1334
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:00,720
Actually, give me one second.

1335
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:00,720
I'm gonna disappear again.

1336
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:00,820
Actually, give me one second.

1337
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:00,820
I'm gonna disappear again.

1338
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,380
I'm gonna disappear again.

1339
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:03,940
Oh, wait.

1340
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:07,420
Uh...

1341
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:08,740
Never mind.

1342
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,660
I don't need to disappear.

1343
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:10,760
I can do this.

1344
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:11,100
Okay.

1345
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,260
How do I do this?

1346
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,020
Guys, I'm a little confused.

1347
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,000
I don't know how things work, okay?

1348
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:21,020
Um...

1349
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:22,480
Uh...

1350
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:23,840
Uh...

1351
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,540
Let's just play the video while I figure it out.

1352
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,200
Understanding of how they would treat their maids.

1353
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:30,820
Um...

1354
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:31,360
Uh...

1355
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:35,000
Thank you for being born.

1356
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:35,600
Chuchuchu.

1357
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:37,680
Samara style.

1358
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,080
But...

1359
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,340
Not born.

1360
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,400
Not born.

1361
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,080
I don't know who I would...

1362
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,240
Who I would...

1363
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:50,060
Sorry, I'm laughing reading your comments.

1364
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,100
I do like...

1365
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,680
I do like mint ice cream.

1366
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,800
I do, I do.

1367
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,360
But cookies and cream.

1368
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,980
No, my name is...

1369
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:02,860
My name is mint.

1370
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,500
Don't change my name.

1371
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,540
Don't change my name!

1372
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,540
That's all I have.

1373
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:09,840
What do they change it to?

1374
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,660
Cookies and cream?

1375
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,400
No, I'm mint.

1376
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,280
Subaru?

1377
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,520
Would I serve Subaru?

1378
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:16,520
I don't know.

1379
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,260
I don't really like Subaru.

1380
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,780
I like...

1381
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,800
Maybe I'll serve Rem.

1382
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,800
I'll serve Rem forever because then she could understand what it's like to have someone serve her.

1383
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,380
And appreciate her.

1384
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,240
And not dump her like Subaru does.

1385
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:33,780
So true.

1386
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,260
Stupid.

1387
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,640
How dare he.

1388
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,700
What an idiot.

1389
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:38,760
I cannot believe.

1390
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,400
Have you seen her face?

1391
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,520
Have you seen how cute she is?

1392
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:43,780
Have you seen how cute she is?

1393
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,480
So, we'll say Rem.

1394
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,620
I'll serve Rem Ojousama forever.

1395
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,880
Rem Ojousama.

1396
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,780
My favorite drink?

1397
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,160
Well, I said bubble tea.

1398
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,320
But specifically...

1399
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:57,960
Specifically...

1400
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:00,860
Specifically mango.

1401
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,500
Mango green tea.

1402
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:03,480
I really like it.

1403
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,280
I love mango green tea.

1404
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,760
Gosh, who is this girl?

1405
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,460
She's so based.

1406
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:13,720
I died falling from a cliff because she was so small to grab the railings.

1407
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,800
I'm not that small.

1408
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,120
I'm really...

1409
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:18,560
It's true though.

1410
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,780
I'm really not that small.

1411
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,920
Thank you, Hayato.

1412
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,020
Thank you for coming.

1413
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:25,680
So, favorite drink?

1414
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,760
Mango green tea.

1415
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,080
I think I do it like this.

1416
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,440
What are some of the things that scares you, Minto-san?

1417
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,100
Uh... ghosts.

1418
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:33,700
True?

1419
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:34,920
True.

1420
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,340
Well, ghosts...

1421
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,940
And also...

1422
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,180
Actually, I don't want to admit that.

1423
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:44,700
I'll just say bugs.

1424
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,580
There's a specific kind of bug.

1425
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,040
And it's so silly.

1426
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,280
So I won't say it.

1427
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:53,300
Wait, I don't even know what I'm talking about here.

1428
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:56,740
Wait, I don't even know what I'm talking about here.

1429
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:57,160
I wonder if it's...

1430
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,500
I wonder if it's...

1431
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,140
Thank you everyone who has come so far.

1432
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:02,660
So...

1433
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,280
I wonder if it's ladybugs.

1434
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,640
Because I am afraid of ladybugs.

1435
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:10,220
Have you ever seen Yuna in the Haunted Hot Springs?

1436
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:11,480
Yes, I have.

1437
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,780
And I really love her.

1438
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,360
Okay, I think I got it.

1439
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,560
She's got a nice body.

1440
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:20,600
So true.

1441
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:22,340
So, um...

1442
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,400
Double Minto!

1443
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:26,500
Hi, hello, Minto-chan.

1444
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,520
I want to ask...

1445
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,040
Which country do you like slash want to travel to?

1446
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:33,100
Triple Minto!

1447
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,000
A country that I want to travel to...

1448
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,760
Oh my god.

1449
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,020
I've never been to Europe.

1450
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,400
So I want to travel all over Europe.

1451
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:42,260
I still haven't been.

1452
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,460
I think.

1453
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:47,700
I sound so different.

1454
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:50,060
No bully in the chat.

1455
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,480
You guys liked me before.

1456
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:53,840
Now you're just like...

1457
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,860
Now you like your voices too.

1458
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,320
No...

1459
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,280
Hold on.

1460
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:00,880
How do I...

1461
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:02,560
No bully.

1462
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,180
No bully in the chat.

1463
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:06,960
I don't feel like I can do it.

1464
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,300
I don't feel like I could...

1465
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,440
I think it's also the...

1466
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,200
The mic too, right?

1467
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:16,700
Probably...

1468
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,780
You like my current voice?

1469
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:23,480
You do?

1470
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:24,920
You do?

1471
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:27,660
You do?

1472
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:28,880
It's okay?

1473
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,980
Part of it is definitely the mic.

1474
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,140
I wonder...

1475
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:34,440
Let's see.

1476
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:36,720
I just answer questions.

1477
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,640
This whole thing.

1478
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:38,760
Oh my gosh!

1479
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,060
Hold on.

1480
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:44,570
What's going on here?

1481
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:46,970
Afraid of ladybugs?

1482
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:47,550
Poor Berry.

1483
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:52,970
It's kind of funny that she's a ladybug because I am afraid of them.

1484
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:54,630
Okay, hold on.

1485
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:57,110
Let's do that.

1486
01:01:58,630 --> 01:01:59,310
Play.

1487
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:01,790
Oh.

1488
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:06,450
The...

1489
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:09,690
The audio is...

1490
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:11,970
The BGM is so much louder than my...

1491
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:14,070
Than my voice, you know?

1492
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:15,950
I'm so indecisive.

1493
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:17,090
I'm so indecisive.

1494
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:20,070
Am I streaming from laptop?

1495
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:20,630
Yes.

1496
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,570
I think everybody knows.

1497
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:25,130
I think everybody knows.

1498
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:27,950
Okay.

1499
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:29,310
We'll have an official name.

1500
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:30,850
And then we'll have fandom.

1501
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:34,190
I was gonna say we'll have a dumb name.

1502
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:35,650
It's iconic.

1503
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,710
Never doubt yourself, my ghoul friend.

1504
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:39,090
It's a doggy dog world.

1505
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:39,990
So true!

1506
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:44,510
How did they know that I was streaming from my laptop?

1507
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:45,950
Make a tweet, make a tweet.

1508
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:46,510
Oh!

1509
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:47,830
My arms!

1510
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:49,530
Um...

1511
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:50,890
My arms!

1512
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:52,590
I tweet.

1513
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:55,390
Up, up, up, up.

1514
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:56,770
Make a tweet, make a tweet.

1515
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,460
I tweet.

1516
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:05,740
Big busts.

1517
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,540
Your favorite.

1518
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:10,220
Uh, uh, favorite.

1519
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:11,840
And redacted dust.

1520
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,020
They phased out of existence.

1521
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:18,600
Oh, they come back eventually.

1522
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,020
But I haven't watched it.

1523
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,920
Oh, and then I also have...

1524
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,160
These guys, look.

1525
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,320
I've only read the manga.

1526
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,740
I've never watched the show.

1527
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,160
So, don't hate me.

1528
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,180
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1529
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:35,500
Oh, look.

1530
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,320
Oh, look.

1531
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:39,740
I think people used to call these fart clouds.

1532
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:40,700
I think people used to call these fart clouds.

1533
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,500
I have little, little ghost friends.

1534
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:43,500
I have little, little ghost friends.

1535
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:44,840
Master!

1536
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:46,600
Master!

1537
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:47,580
Master!

1538
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:52,940
Oh my gosh.

1539
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:55,380
Proto-wisps.

1540
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:55,980
I know, right?

1541
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:56,580
Master.

1542
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:56,600
Master.

1543
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,320
Thank you for the question.

1544
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,080
Thank you.

1545
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,200
So cool.

1546
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:06,840
Thank you, thank you.

1547
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:08,140
So cool.

1548
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,440
I had three... I had three wisps.

1549
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:13,880
At all times.

1550
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,480
Four would have been maybe a little spookier, right?

1551
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:18,160
But, let's see.

1552
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,440
Anything else that happens?

1553
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:20,400
No.

1554
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,900
Literally, that's it.

1555
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:22,600
How does it end?

1556
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:24,180
How do I end the stream?

1557
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:25,440
Thank you for watching.

1558
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,200
I'm so happy.

1559
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,180
Thank you.

1560
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:29,480
Thank you.

1561
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:30,520
Thank you.

1562
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,460
Thank you.

1563
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:32,900
Thank you for your hard work.

1564
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:33,820
Thank you.

1565
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:35,240
Thank you.

1566
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:35,860
Bye-bye.

1567
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:36,420
Bye.

1568
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:37,300
Bye-bye.

1569
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:37,640
Bye-bye.

1570
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,380
Bye-bye.

1571
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,580
Four, four, four.

1572
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:39,900
So spooky.

1573
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:40,660
One more donation.

1574
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:44,060
Thank you so much.

1575
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:44,740
Thank you.

1576
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,840
Do you guys miss when I call you Master?

1577
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:48,860
Bye-bye.

1578
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:49,620
Bye-bye.

1579
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,340
Kind of like say it just at the beginning.

1580
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,500
Bye-bye.

1581
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:52,800
Bye-bye.

1582
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,100
Bye-bye.

1583
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:53,460
Bye-bye.

1584
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:54,500
Okay.

1585
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:55,620
One, two, three.

1586
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:01,360
Okay.

1587
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,060
Okay.

1588
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:02,520
Okay.

1589
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:02,700
Bye.

1590
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:10,730
Okay.

1591
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:10,990
Bye.

1592
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:14,050
Bye.

1593
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:15,410
Three

1594
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:44,310
seconds.

1595
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:47,010
It's over.

1596
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:49,850
No way.

1597
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:55,430
Oh gosh.

1598
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:55,830
Okay.

1599
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:56,090
Bye.

1600
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:56,550
Okay.

1601
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:56,770
Bye.

1602
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:59,390
Oh no.

1603
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:04,190
Oh my gosh.

1604
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:04,310
Oh my gosh.

1605
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:07,670
Let's see if there's anything else.

1606
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:09,470
Any other streams and stuff.

1607
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:13,610
I'm not going to go through like you know a ton of them or anything like that.

1608
01:06:13,830 --> 01:06:14,090
Oh here.

1609
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:15,030
I'll get rid of the menu too.

1610
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:16,210
Wow.

1611
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:20,230
It's really like I'm just back in the day baby.

1612
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,650
One of the first...

1613
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:26,890
The first thing I played ever was Witch's House.

1614
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,690
Which is a...

1615
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:31,190
Which is a...

1616
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:33,190
You know that... What's it called?

1617
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:33,410
Game.

1618
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:34,770
The pixel game?

1619
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:35,930
Pixel game.

1620
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:38,350
First...

1621
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:41,110
Stop.

1622
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:44,090
But what did I do for other streams?

1623
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:44,950
Okay.

1624
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,330
I'm going to go to my very next stream.

1625
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:48,750
We'll do the Witch's House.

1626
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:50,490
How did I end the stream though?

1627
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:52,390
Right?

1628
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,970
First Moi Moi game stream.

1629
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:56,930
If you guys have noticed my...

1630
01:06:57,470 --> 01:06:59,570
Or maybe you haven't noticed but my...

1631
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:00,470
My...

1632
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:05,550
My playlists are all kind of similar to how they were back then.

1633
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:08,170
So my playlists are like...

1634
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:08,450
Hold on.

1635
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:10,430
I'm pulling it up so I can remember too.

1636
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:13,590
I have like...

1637
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:15,530
Moi random hauntings.

1638
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:17,270
Which this stream is in.

1639
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:18,930
I have Mint's Moi Moi gaming.

1640
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:21,270
Moi membership streams.

1641
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:22,670
Moi collab streams.

1642
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:23,810
Moi karaoke streams.

1643
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:25,570
Moi spirit box sessions.

1644
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:28,390
You know like... Everything is so Moi Moi.

1645
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:31,350
Yeah.

1646
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:33,170
Everything is Moi Moi Moi Moi.

1647
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:34,450
Oh my gosh!

1648
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:35,710
Wait.

1649
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:36,370
You can't see.

1650
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:39,710
The amount of likes on this one!

1651
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:41,990
Oh.

1652
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:42,430
Wait.

1653
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:43,330
That's why you can't see.

1654
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:44,690
Not because I'm blocking it.

1655
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:46,550
Because you can't see it.

1656
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:47,290
Small.

1657
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:53,190
Look at this.

1658
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:55,270
Look.

1659
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,000
4-4-4!

1660
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:02,580
How spooky is that?

1661
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,160
How spooky is that?

1662
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:05,180
How spooky is that?

1663
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:08,680
Yeah.

1664
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:09,480
Okay.

1665
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:09,880
Let's see.

1666
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:10,780
So I started...

1667
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:10,920
Oh!

1668
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:12,940
I

1669
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:20,600
don't even have a starting screen.

1670
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:24,080
I just jump right into it, baby.

1671
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:24,600
I just jump right into it, baby.

1672
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,440
You can hear me breathing.

1673
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:34,190
Can you guys see me?

1674
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:44,560
Hello.

1675
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:44,680
Hello.

1676
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:46,880
Why do I sound so sad?

1677
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:47,720
Hello.

1678
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:48,900
Hello.

1679
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:50,360
Hello.

1680
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,640
And the breathing is...

1681
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,480
This is the best overlay ever.

1682
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:04,340
The game is just clipping into my...

1683
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,280
Into my...

1684
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,240
My...

1685
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,160
What's the word?

1686
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:10,700
Logo!

1687
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:13,020
Just...

1688
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:14,700
I don't know how this...

1689
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:17,420
This...

1690
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:18,720
What this chat is.

1691
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:20,820
I don't even know.

1692
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:22,280
Am I here?

1693
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,180
Am I here?

1694
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,080
Am I here?

1695
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:29,280
So...

1696
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,880
Oh, at some point, look.

1697
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,200
Some ghosties come out.

1698
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:34,340
Just look.

1699
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:35,540
Let's see.

1700
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,140
I just want to know how I end the stream.

1701
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,160
Do I have a closed...

1702
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,720
I don't think so, you guys.

1703
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,040
I think I just end the stream.

1704
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:46,000
You guys, I think I just end the stream as I did before.

1705
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:47,160
Yay!

1706
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:48,960
What the...

1707
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:49,760
What was that?

1708
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,880
Why was this...

1709
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:04,900
It's the other...

1710
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:05,040
It's...

1711
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:09,200
Oh my god, it's so loud.

1712
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,480
Why am I so low energy?

1713
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:13,520
Why am I so low energy?

1714
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,160
I feel so like...

1715
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,020
Okay, we're gonna listen to Bustin' now.

1716
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:18,960
Okay.

1717
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:22,420
Bustin' Bustin' Bustin' Bustin' Oh...

1718
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:26,380
Maybe I have changed more than I thought that I have.

1719
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:28,880
Probably nervous.

1720
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:29,760
I think so too.

1721
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:31,820
OL work.

1722
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,100
I wasn't...

1723
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:36,500
I was tired from being an OL.

1724
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:42,080
I was tired from being an office lady, so I was just...

1725
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:42,680
Sad.

1726
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:44,900
I was just so sad.

1727
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:45,660
I'm sorry.

1728
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:46,080
Hold on.

1729
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,140
I'll move this too.

1730
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:50,540
I don't know how high my heart-rate has gotten.

1731
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:54,720
I don't know how high my heart-rate has gotten.

1732
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,000
It's true though.

1733
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:57,160
It's so true.

1734
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,400
But...

1735
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:04,060
But... I really liked streaming so I did as much as I could back then.

1736
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,340
But... I really liked streaming so I did as much as I could back then.

1737
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:05,760
I

1738
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:17,440
loved it !

1739
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,100
I loved it !

1740
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:25,620
INFP We did this on the podcast!

1741
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:25,720
Cast.

1742
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,920
Wait, let me ask Matora.

1743
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:29,240
What am I?

1744
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,500
What... what am I?

1745
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:39,640
L... L... M... N... O... P. 51 cards!

1746
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:43,510
Thank you for the... What happened to my face?

1747
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:48,430
What happened to my face?

1748
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,920
How do I change it back?

1749
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,500
How do I change it back?

1750
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:16,350
I fixed it.

1751
01:12:18,650 --> 01:12:20,230
I fixed it, I fixed it, I fixed it.

1752
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:24,370
Past Minto is haunting us.

1753
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:27,930
I don't know if you guys have ever seen... I think... hold on.

1754
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,470
I think it's this.

1755
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:31,130
Oh wait.

1756
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:34,690
I'll have to try later.

1757
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:36,430
I'm not manifesting enough ghost power.

1758
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:39,450
She's got such a thousand-yard stare.

1759
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:40,650
It's true!

1760
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:42,550
I'm just kinda...

1761
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:47,710
I watched a video recently about... do you guys know the movie?

1762
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:51,610
I've never watched it as a kid, but it's called The Indian in the Cupboard.

1763
01:12:52,770 --> 01:12:57,350
And it's about this kid that gets like a little toy and he puts it in his cupboard and it comes to life.

1764
01:12:57,730 --> 01:13:00,750
But the kid always has this thousand-yard stare.

1765
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:01,990
He's just like...

1766
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:09,000
Just like this.

1767
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:11,720
I wish... wait.

1768
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,980
I wonder if I can make my Mintos look at each other.

1769
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:16,540
Okay, Minto.

1770
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:20,440
We're gonna... hold on.

1771
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:23,140
One second.

1772
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,960
We're gonna have you look at each other.

1773
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:27,020
Mintos.

1774
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:31,760
You're over there.

1775
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:33,860
One second.

1776
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,200
You come over here.

1777
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:39,480
Hi, Minto!

1778
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,620
Hello there, Minto.

1779
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,340
How are you doing today?

1780
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,220
I'm great.

1781
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:44,880
Thank you, Minto.

1782
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:49,620
Now, kiss?

1783
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:02,950
Self-love.

1784
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:08,250
Thank you, Miss First!

1785
01:14:09,090 --> 01:14:10,510
You're generally such an amazing person.

1786
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:11,870
So proud to see you shining today.

1787
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:14,830
Thank you, though.

1788
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:15,510
Thank you.

1789
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:20,410
Imagine putting an anime figure in the cupboard.

1790
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:20,830
I know.

1791
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:21,770
What?

1792
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:22,030
What?

1793
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:22,190
Okay.

1794
01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:23,050
Okay.

1795
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:25,530
If you could put one thing in the cupboard...

1796
01:14:26,430 --> 01:14:28,490
If you could put one thing in the cupboard...

1797
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:30,690
But... only one.

1798
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:32,330
Only one thing.

1799
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:35,670
What would you put in your cupboard to turn into real?

1800
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:38,090
What would you put in your cupboard?

1801
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:42,060
A Gundam.

1802
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:42,780
Minto.

1803
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:44,320
No, you don't have that.

1804
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,320
You don't have that.

1805
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,840
A jar containing a ghost.

1806
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:51,380
Whiskey?

1807
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:51,860
What?

1808
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,800
That doesn't make any sense.

1809
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,180
I know.

1810
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:55,560
Minto Stanley.

1811
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:57,660
Okay.

1812
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:01,500
I'm getting a little freaked out that Minto is staring at me.

1813
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,400
So we're just gonna...

1814
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:04,020
We're gonna...

1815
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:05,720
Fix it.

1816
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:06,140
There we go.

1817
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,700
Well, I don't know what...

1818
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:17,140
I guess I... I thought really truly that I was like, I haven't changed so much.

1819
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:23,400
Since I... since I was around... since like I first started streaming, but...

1820
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,640
I've actually have changed so much.

1821
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:27,480
Way more than I ever realized.

1822
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:29,100
Especially my voice.

1823
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,360
Like, that's kinda crazy.

1824
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:30,740
Hold on.

1825
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,980
I'm seeing if there's anything else that I've played or done or whatever.

1826
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,900
She's so different.

1827
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:37,460
Oh, yeah.

1828
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:38,860
I wonder.

1829
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:39,800
Let's see like a...

1830
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,860
Oh, I have a 4.44 sub karaoke stream.

1831
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:45,740
Let's see how my singing is.

1832
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:46,840
Let's see.

1833
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:47,360
Oh, gosh.

1834
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:47,620
Wait.

1835
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:48,700
This might actually be...

1836
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,620
This might actually be unbearable.

1837
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:52,120
Hold on.

1838
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,540
4.44k subs.

1839
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:01,400
You've gotten way more confident.

1840
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:03,800
Okay, okay, okay.

1841
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:07,080
Surely, this is 3 years ago.

1842
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:10,200
Surely at this point I have a... an opening...

1843
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:10,360
Oh!

1844
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,900
It's the one that I use now!

1845
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:13,300
And a closing.

1846
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,180
Okay, okay.

1847
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:15,120
Alright, here we go.

1848
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:25,770
My opening sound...

1849
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:29,230
Is just the joy sound.

1850
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,160
Where's the music?

1851
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:44,900
You can't hear it?

1852
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:45,500
Is it too soft?

1853
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:47,660
Like that?

1854
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:49,080
Yeah, it's like...

1855
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:51,660
It's the joy sound music.

1856
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:57,460
My birthday coincidentally.

1857
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,380
Happy birthday, Ethan!

1858
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,060
Oh my goodness.

1859
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:04,200
It's always something.

1860
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,160
These are so funny.

1861
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,260
Here, let's skip a little ahead.

1862
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:09,660
What did I sing?

1863
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:16,340
What did I sing back in the day?

1864
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,860
I'm gonna skip... here.

1865
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,260
Wait, I sang the...

1866
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:36,640
... Recently.

1867
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:36,860
Recently.

1868
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:47,540
And then this is a Conan song, Nazo, and then Fanta.

1869
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,980
Wait, what's this one?

1870
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:52,920
What is happening?

1871
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,800
Why is it Legend of Zelda background?

1872
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,740
Connect, part of your world, Mario, Pokemon edition.

1873
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,020
Oh wait.

1874
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,080
What is this?

1875
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,760
What is the background?

1876
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:17,920
Oh my god!

1877
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:25,220
Oh no.

1878
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:34,780
Oh my gosh.

1879
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,020
Mint of the past was so brave.

1880
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,220
No reverb, nothing.

1881
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,800
Just regular...

1882
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:41,500
Regular...

1883
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:42,160
Fake Nate!

1884
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:42,720
You're there!

1885
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:46,660
There you are!

1886
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:51,120
And Cosmo, you're there too!

1887
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:54,120
Raw dog.

1888
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:54,640
Stop!

1889
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:55,740
Don't say that!

1890
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,140
Oh my gosh.

1891
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:01,320
Isaruru!

1892
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,080
There you are!

1893
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:05,800
But...

1894
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,100
Oh

1895
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:13,870
my gosh!

1896
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:17,170
I feel like I've seen F.W.A.S.T.

1897
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:18,790
around, but maybe I'm gaslighting myself.

1898
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:21,890
Salute to the old heads.

1899
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:23,630
Mewtwo.

1900
01:19:26,610 --> 01:19:27,050
Let's see.

1901
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:28,030
What else is here?

1902
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:29,370
What's this one?

1903
01:19:36,330 --> 01:19:37,010
Oh my gosh.

1904
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:37,210
Wait.

1905
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:38,730
Did I actually sing Fancy Baby Doll?

1906
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:41,190
Da da da da da da da.

1907
01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:43,770
This is Trendsing Pulse.

1908
01:19:43,770 --> 01:19:45,610
Maybe nothing has changed.

1909
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:49,370
Maybe I need to learn new songs.

1910
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:55,390
Maybe I need to learn new stuff in four years.

1911
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:05,470
Mado!

1912
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:06,250
Mado!

1913
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:07,170
Mado!

1914
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:08,350
Mado kime...

1915
01:20:10,690 --> 01:20:11,330
Yay!

1916
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:11,390
Yay!

1917
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:14,890
Ikenai Borderline was that old?

1918
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:15,130
Wow.

1919
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:16,110
What are you talking about?

1920
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,270
Ikenai Borderline...

1921
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:20,150
I think was a couple years even before I debuted.

1922
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,870
Sorry, OBS is being weird.

1923
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:24,670
Sorry, sorry!

1924
01:20:25,330 --> 01:20:25,790
Okay.

1925
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:27,970
I think...

1926
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:29,690
I think...

1927
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:34,210
I don't know, is there anything else you guys want to see of my old streams?

1928
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:37,270
I think we got the idea, haven't we?

1929
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:38,970
Fukashigi no Karte!

1930
01:20:41,330 --> 01:20:41,650
Ta-da!

1931
01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:44,450
Oh, this is Snow Halation.

1932
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:52,750
I just recently put out a short of this song.

1933
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:56,290
Show Yomawari?

1934
01:20:57,950 --> 01:20:59,470
What, like the end of Yomawari?

1935
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:02,210
Okay guys, this is when I first ever lost it.

1936
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:02,530
Hold on.

1937
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:06,390
This is when I first ever lost it on stream.

1938
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:08,950
Wait.

1939
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:10,870
Yomawari...

1940
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:13,490
Three?

1941
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:17,050
How many parts did it take me to beat this game?

1942
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:19,090
I don't see anymore.

1943
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:19,810
It must be three.

1944
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:24,420
Must be three.

1945
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:28,860
This one.

1946
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:30,680
Moi moi game stream.

1947
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,180
But it wasn't very moi moi, I think.

1948
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,400
I think actually...

1949
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,320
Let's see, I was fighting the final boss.

1950
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:40,880
Hold on.

1951
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:42,800
Did I beat it?

1952
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:43,820
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

1953
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,180
Joshua, thank you!

1954
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:50,940
Here we go.

1955
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:53,100
First time I ever lost it.

1956
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:53,740
Maybe here.

1957
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:55,220
Oh.

1958
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:57,830
Oh.

1959
01:21:58,190 --> 01:21:58,690
Oh.

1960
01:21:59,290 --> 01:21:59,790
Oh.

1961
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:02,370
Friendly video, is that okay?

1962
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:05,710
Is that okay if this becomes my...

1963
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:06,090
Whoa!

1964
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:07,490
What happened to the quality?

1965
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:10,010
There we go.

1966
01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:12,930
So from the walkthrough it says to circle around the edge...

1967
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:15,290
How long was I on this fight for?

1968
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:17,790
A long time.

1969
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:19,870
Oh gosh, this is giving...

1970
01:22:19,870 --> 01:22:20,690
This is just too...

1971
01:22:20,690 --> 01:22:21,570
Oh my gosh.

1972
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:22,670
How was I on this fight?

1973
01:22:23,050 --> 01:22:25,490
Okay, started around 1.38...

1974
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:27,130
And I'm at 2.37!

1975
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:30,630
So I've been on it for an hour.

1976
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:34,570
This fight is actually super hard.

1977
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:37,650
I wonder how well I would do now.

1978
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:41,150
Okay.

1979
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:45,210
Maybe I'll try to still be nice.

1980
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:45,790
Whoa!

1981
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:50,930
But if I let something slip, I'm sorry.

1982
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:52,410
I'm sorry.

1983
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:53,710
Let's see.

1984
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:55,490
When did I really start losing it?

1985
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:57,530
I wish I could see the comments.

1986
01:22:58,150 --> 01:22:59,310
Same winter noises.

1987
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:04,590
After this, I'm going to...

1988
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:05,350
Oh yeah.

1989
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:07,290
After this, I'm going to announce some...

1990
01:23:07,290 --> 01:23:08,070
Oh my god.

1991
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:09,070
Girlie!

1992
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,310
I'm going to announce some stuff, so...

1993
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:12,790
What the mid-ception?

1994
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:16,890
YouTube's policy is really dumb for that.

1995
01:23:17,090 --> 01:23:20,290
Because they make everyone conform...

1996
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:22,350
What am I talking about?

1997
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:24,090
...to children, even if you...

1998
01:23:24,090 --> 01:23:25,290
Conform to children?

1999
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:27,250
...say your channel isn't for children.

2000
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:27,650
Oh!

2001
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:31,570
Like, obviously this game is not for children.

2002
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:36,230
But if I don't swear it's monetized, what sense does that make?

2003
01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:37,010
You know?

2004
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:37,710
Oh, I'm...

2005
01:23:37,710 --> 01:23:39,150
Yeah, go off.

2006
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:40,150
Go off, Pashmint.

2007
01:23:41,470 --> 01:23:42,490
Oh, no!

2008
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:43,370
You had it!

2009
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:45,270
You had it!

2010
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:47,490
And then I'm still fighting on my thumbnail.

2011
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:51,130
Remember the thumbnail I told you about earlier?

2012
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:54,010
That's the one I was still fighting about.

2013
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:58,150
They kept demonetizing my stream because of it.

2014
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:01,970
Don't whitelist my thumbnail.

2015
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:03,770
Because there's no reason

2016
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:08,420
for my thumbnail.

2017
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:08,920
Happy late...

2018
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,240
What do you mean late first anniversary?

2019
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,300
Oh, I guess it is kind of late, right?

2020
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,340
To be taken down.

2021
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:14,040
Thank you!

2022
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:16,000
Fight for the booba.

2023
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,660
Now you get thumbnails that are even crazier, right?

2024
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,340
I don't know how to juke them into...

2025
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:23,500
To go out, you know?

2026
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,480
I really...

2027
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:24,760
Come on, please!

2028
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:26,240
When do I start popping off, though?

2029
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,400
His pinky touched me.

2030
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:28,280
It went...

2031
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:28,480
Boink!

2032
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,240
What am I talking about?

2033
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:31,800
Boink!

2034
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:32,460
Boink!

2035
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:32,860
But...

2036
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:34,760
But yeah!

2037
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,440
I started with the bottom one, but the top one is the hardest to get.

2038
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:42,320
So, if I get it first...

2039
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:42,560
Oh!

2040
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:44,140
Yeah!

2041
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,520
Because I can like...

2042
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,040
They're not...

2043
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,620
Because they camp up there the most.

2044
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:48,480
It's terrible.

2045
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:49,820
It's absolutely the worst.

2046
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:50,160
It's true.

2047
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:51,000
Pop off, girly.

2048
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:51,900
Pop off.

2049
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:54,780
Peculiar things are the gifted!

2050
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:57,840
Anyway...

2051
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:58,540
Yeah.

2052
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,120
I think that's...

2053
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,880
That's about everything, isn't it?

2054
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:03,720
I think that's about everything.

2055
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:06,160
Wow.

2056
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:06,940
Look at...

2057
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:07,440
Look at...

2058
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,360
Back in the day...

2059
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,860
I don't think I need this heart rate monitor anymore.

2060
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:11,420
Hopefully...

2061
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:12,580
I don't think it got so high.

2062
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:13,320
Maybe...

2063
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:13,900
Maybe I'm normal.

2064
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,640
Aren't you gonna show the sleepy ASMR stream?

2065
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:18,380
Sleepy ASMR...

2066
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:20,900
Sleepy ASMR stream?

2067
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:22,420
Hmm?

2068
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:26,420
Sleepy ASMR stream?

2069
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,060
50 Ikenai borderlines?

2070
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:32,300
Let's see...

2071
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:33,780
Where is that even?

2072
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:34,980
Oh!

2073
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,860
Singing Ikenai borderline 50 plus 1 times.

2074
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,040
Um...

2075
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:42,960
Oh...

2076
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:43,300
Oh...

2077
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:44,300
Oh...

2078
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:45,400
Oh my gosh.

2079
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:45,680
Wait.

2080
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:47,320
I actually want to see this one too.

2081
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:50,620
When bore...

2082
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:53,580
No...

2083
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:54,960
Uh...

2084
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:56,120
Here...

2085
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:57,020
There...

2086
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:58,120
I become Mikumo.

2087
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,300
I become Mintumo.

2088
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:01,460
Wow!

2089
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:04,560
Oh my god!

2090
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:05,260
Different opening!

2091
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:08,020
Cosmo, isn't this the one you made?

2092
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:12,660
Isn't this the one you made?

2093
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:13,280
Oh!

2094
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:13,620
Let's see.

2095
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:15,620
This could be bad.

2096
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,280
This could be bad.

2097
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,640
This could be so bad.

2098
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:20,120
Why is it bad?

2099
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:21,000
Wait.

2100
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:21,580
Why is it bad?

2101
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:26,720
My hands are like this because I'm a ghost!

2102
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:28,820
Ah!

2103
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:29,620
Paige, thank you!

2104
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:30,260
Ah!

2105
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:31,180
Toofy, thank you!

2106
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:32,760
Okay.

2107
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:33,800
Thank you!

2108
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:34,780
Okay.

2109
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:36,720
How

2110
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:53,280
did I go to this one immediately?

2111
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:53,900
Oh my god!

2112
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:57,420
Jeremy!

2113
01:26:57,580 --> 01:26:58,020
There you are!

2114
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:58,180
Jeremy!

2115
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:02,040
Splatoon!

2116
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:02,680
There you are!

2117
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:04,380
Ah!

2118
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:19,870
Bloodlust!

2119
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:20,490
Thank you!

2120
01:27:20,670 --> 01:27:21,570
Thank you so much!

2121
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:36,650
Guys, this is how I used to sound like.

2122
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:38,530
Have I improved in my singing a little bit?

2123
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:42,370
Have I improved in my singing?

2124
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:44,170
Or did I regre...

2125
01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:45,810
Actually, I feel like I've regressed quite.

2126
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:48,290
Can you hit that note now?

2127
01:27:49,630 --> 01:27:50,770
Probably not right now.

2128
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:51,210
Oh!

2129
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:51,390
Oh!

2130
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:52,970
It must be the new mic.

2131
01:27:54,990 --> 01:27:56,250
You peaked here.

2132
01:27:58,270 --> 01:27:58,910
I...

2133
01:27:58,910 --> 01:27:59,650
Yeah.

2134
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:00,230
I must have...

2135
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:01,730
I've probably regressed.

2136
01:28:01,810 --> 01:28:02,470
And so...

2137
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:03,130
I'm so sorry.

2138
01:28:04,810 --> 01:28:05,870
You peaked.

2139
01:28:10,770 --> 01:28:11,410
Wait.

2140
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:12,890
Voice acting stream!

2141
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:16,610
Practice stream at 1 hour 44 minutes snake.

2142
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:17,950
What?

2143
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:21,560
What?

2144
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:22,300
Wait.

2145
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:22,520
What?

2146
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:23,060
Hold on.

2147
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:23,260
Wait.

2148
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:23,540
I thought...

2149
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:24,320
What do you...

2150
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:24,560
Wait.

2151
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:24,900
Really?

2152
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:25,920
How did...

2153
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:26,020
Wait.

2154
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,440
First of all, how do you have that information?

2155
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:28,920
And second of all...

2156
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,300
Where is the voice acting stream?

2157
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,280
Voice acting...

2158
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,020
Voice acting stream.

2159
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:36,140
Voice acting stream.

2160
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,280
Voice acting...

2161
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:39,260
Voice...

2162
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,500
Voice acting practice stream?

2163
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:45,260
For 1 hour 44 minutes?

2164
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:46,080
I do snake?

2165
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:49,920
I do snake?

2166
01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:58,500
You guys!

2167
01:28:58,760 --> 01:28:59,140
There is...

2168
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,800
There's something I need to share with you guys!

2169
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,240
That we need to bring back!

2170
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:06,940
So, there's a video that I really, really love.

2171
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:08,440
I still love it to this day.

2172
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:10,900
I think I... oh gosh, where did I have it saved?

2173
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:13,020
I just have to find where I saved it!

2174
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:17,120
But, basically, it's like... it's about the eagle.

2175
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:20,040
And I must show you guys, for those who don't know.

2176
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:24,560
Maybe those who were here back in the day remember it a little bit.

2177
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:28,700
But if you don't know... where did I save it though?

2178
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:31,240
I don't remember.

2179
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:32,020
Oh no!

2180
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:33,960
No, I found it like the other day!

2181
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:35,660
Is that under here?

2182
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:38,620
No... I'll show you guys.

2183
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,180
I'll find it.

2184
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:42,380
The eagle fly higher!

2185
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:43,700
Above the clouds!

2186
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:44,040
Exactly!

2187
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:44,980
Oh wait!

2188
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:47,540
No, these are just random videos.

2189
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:49,440
What are these?

2190
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,100
What are they?

2191
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:54,540
Oh, these are just random videos.

2192
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:58,060
Oh, I still have my intro video!

2193
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,000
No way!

2194
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:02,200
I still have my intro video.

2195
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:09,840
In here, I have a video of... I think this is a video of Pikami saying my name.

2196
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:19,620
I still have a video... look at this.

2197
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:22,560
I have a screenshot of Pikami when she modded me on her channel.

2198
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:26,160
I can't get rid of it.

2199
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:26,880
It's my precious.

2200
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:32,800
It's my precious... my precious... you know...

2201
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:38,540
And then I have this screenshot as well of me next to Pikami when we were playing Among Us together.

2202
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,940
Oh my gosh!

2203
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,180
I know I had it though!

2204
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:47,900
I know I had it.

2205
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:49,040
I just can't find it.

2206
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:49,740
What?

2207
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:53,300
Okay, I should have been more prepared.

2208
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,340
I'm so sorry you guys.

2209
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:58,040
But I'll find it and I'll show you guys next time I find it.

2210
01:30:58,060 --> 01:31:01,500
I'll be like, look, this is one of my favorite videos of all time.

2211
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:03,460
But where did I have it?

2212
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:04,320
Maybe... Oh, wait!

2213
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:05,260
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2214
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,780
Wait, wait, wait.

2215
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:09,020
We're waiting.

2216
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:09,680
We're waiting.

2217
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,780
And then we're gonna watch...

2218
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:17,300
No.

2219
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:17,960
I lost.

2220
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:18,740
I don't think so.

2221
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:19,180
No.

2222
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:20,360
No.

2223
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:22,300
Dang it.

2224
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:23,960
Oh, where did I save this at?

2225
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:26,180
Hold!

2226
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:27,440
Hold!

2227
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:31,440
I don't know where I saved it.

2228
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:33,580
I do have it somewhere though, as you can tell.

2229
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:35,160
I save everything.

2230
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:36,160
I keep everything.

2231
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,840
I'm a little freaky like that.

2232
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:38,920
Okay.

2233
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,820
So here I'm doing a snake impression.

2234
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:42,100
Let's see.

2235
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:50,500
Oh, Bashamin!

2236
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,180
Is she okay?

2237
01:31:58,340 --> 01:31:59,260
I don't know what's going on.

2238
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:01,220
I think I'm dying.

2239
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:01,920
Of laughter.

2240
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,220
Or just dying.

2241
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:04,000
Again.

2242
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:05,700
Why am I laughing so much?

2243
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:06,500
Wait.

2244
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:09,440
I'm crying.

2245
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:12,220
I think I'm actually crying.

2246
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:13,620
She cries higher.

2247
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,360
Above the cloud.

2248
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:17,380
Above the cloud.

2249
01:32:23,690 --> 01:32:24,210
Wait.

2250
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:24,730
Okay.

2251
01:32:24,810 --> 01:32:25,650
We're almost to 144.

2252
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:28,730
What's that sound?

2253
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:29,510
It's like a...

2254
01:32:30,210 --> 01:32:30,730
Sorry.

2255
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:31,250
Ohamito.

2256
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:32,170
Good morning.

2257
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:33,850
Good morning.

2258
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:37,570
While this plays, I'll also look for it.

2259
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:39,630
The timing.

2260
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:42,010
The timing.

2261
01:32:43,990 --> 01:32:45,750
We'll never know what's so funny.

2262
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:48,390
Next.

2263
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:50,470
I don't see it playing.

2264
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:51,330
What is that?

2265
01:32:53,330 --> 01:32:54,550
Sorry in advance.

2266
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:55,950
Sorry in advance.

2267
01:32:56,730 --> 01:33:00,110
Can you please say, please say, in solid snake language?

2268
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:02,390
Okay.

2269
01:33:05,470 --> 01:33:06,270
No way.

2270
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:08,870
No.

2271
01:33:09,230 --> 01:33:09,530
No.

2272
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:12,070
No.

2273
01:33:12,730 --> 01:33:13,130
No.

2274
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:13,350
Come on.

2275
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:13,850
You can do this.

2276
01:33:15,230 --> 01:33:16,650
I hate it.

2277
01:33:19,790 --> 01:33:20,430
I'm gonna do it.

2278
01:33:20,510 --> 01:33:20,710
No.

2279
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:21,290
I don't hate this.

2280
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:21,870
I love this.

2281
01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:23,610
Hmm.

2282
01:33:23,730 --> 01:33:24,130
Colonel.

2283
01:33:24,570 --> 01:33:25,270
I'm a child.

2284
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:27,090
It's okay.

2285
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:27,810
You can do it, Mint.

2286
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:28,750
You can do it.

2287
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:30,190
You can do it, me from the past.

2288
01:33:30,390 --> 01:33:31,710
The prophecy is true.

2289
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:34,410
Metal Gear has always been a part of me.

2290
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:37,830
How did you know this?

2291
01:33:39,770 --> 01:33:41,790
How did you know that this was here?

2292
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:43,430
In this VOD?

2293
01:33:44,430 --> 01:33:45,670
How did you know this?

2294
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:54,440
Oh god.

2295
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:57,100
I can't even get through it.

2296
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:00,620
I can't even get through it.

2297
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:03,180
That's so funny.

2298
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:05,320
The sacred text.

2299
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:13,000
I'm dummy thick and the clap of my ass cheeks keeps alerting the guards.

2300
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:18,180
Colonel, I'm trying to sneak around but I'm dummy thick.

2301
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:23,780
It was foretold in the scripts.

2302
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:25,160
Kojumbo does it again.

2303
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:27,140
Kojumbo does it again.

2304
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,180
Free will is a myth?

2305
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:34,220
Let's see.

2306
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:36,040
There was this one I wanted to look at.

2307
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,980
Maybe this is the last one that I do.

2308
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:39,480
Because I'm just kind of curious.

2309
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:43,080
It's an Akiba tour.

2310
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:47,480
Which I did an updated version when I first came back.

2311
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:49,140
Oh my goodness.

2312
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:51,980
Please wait to be seated.

2313
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:54,040
Let's see where we're here.

2314
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:57,020
Jonathan's.

2315
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:58,860
This Jonathan's is not there anymore.

2316
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:04,380
This Jonathan's isn't there anymore, I believe.

2317
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,040
We need to match that character.

2318
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,560
A Goku haircut.

2319
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:10,180
Goku haircut!

2320
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:14,100
You could get a one...

2321
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:15,520
Let's see what else is around.

2322
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:17,480
Mileage!

2323
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:18,200
I don't know how to do that.

2324
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,400
Oh wait, is this it?

2325
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:21,040
Oh, we can go back.

2326
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:22,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2327
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:23,560
Okay, let's go back.

2328
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:26,420
I feel like I'm sensing deja vu right now.

2329
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,520
March 2020.

2330
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Did it burn down?

2331
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,440
No, they just changed the place.

2332
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:35,120
Is this where we talk about Akiba CIA?

2333
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:38,060
That Hotomoto Grill also isn't there anymore, I believe.

2334
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:39,760
Oh, I know.

2335
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:40,300
This is...

2336
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:41,700
Oh, Hanyon!

2337
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,000
Hanyon!

2338
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Oh my god.

2339
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:45,700
Let's play.

2340
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:48,780
Survival game?

2341
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:49,340
What is this?

2342
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,380
I think that's still there though.

2343
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:52,540
Soft...

2344
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,480
Wait, wait, wait.

2345
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:55,240
Wait, wait, wait.

2346
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:58,380
Akiba CIA is right there.

2347
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:02,340
Akiba CIA is like right there, isn't it?

2348
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:03,380
Oh wait, no, never mind.

2349
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:05,940
Meet... meant to meet up at Akiba CIA.

2350
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,180
Oh my god!

2351
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:15,800
I have made meet up at Akiba CIA.

2352
01:36:20,710 --> 01:36:21,810
Oh my god!

2353
01:36:21,970 --> 01:36:22,590
Akiba CIA.

2354
01:36:23,470 --> 01:36:25,050
The way to the Google person.

2355
01:36:25,390 --> 01:36:26,410
Oh my god!

2356
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:27,970
It's not there anymore, unfortunately.

2357
01:36:28,270 --> 01:36:28,630
But...

2358
01:36:28,650 --> 01:36:30,150
Oh, wow!

2359
01:36:31,710 --> 01:36:34,650
It's like some of the smaller things that I remember, you know?

2360
01:36:34,730 --> 01:36:35,530
Perfect timing.

2361
01:36:38,610 --> 01:36:41,310
Anyways, this is fine.

2362
01:36:41,490 --> 01:36:41,950
This is...

2363
01:36:41,950 --> 01:36:44,090
A fun trip down memory lane.

2364
01:36:44,550 --> 01:36:46,810
I still am confused how you...

2365
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:50,210
Oh my gosh, this stream is just called The Spy Animals Got Me.

2366
01:36:52,030 --> 01:36:52,570
Thank

2367
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:56,830
you for the anniversary!

2368
01:36:57,510 --> 01:36:58,050
Yeah!

2369
01:36:58,170 --> 01:36:58,810
Thank you, Sai!

2370
01:36:59,190 --> 01:36:59,930
Thank you.

2371
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:05,750
The Spy Animals Got Me.

2372
01:37:09,410 --> 01:37:11,670
It's getting more and more unhinged.

2373
01:37:13,950 --> 01:37:15,370
And then...

2374
01:37:15,370 --> 01:37:18,570
And then...

2375
01:37:19,230 --> 01:37:21,170
My review...

2376
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:23,510
And then my announcement...

2377
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:25,630
Reveal this of how I look now.

2378
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:28,890
And then my karaoke plus announcement.

2379
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:30,930
I'm so sorry.

2380
01:37:33,150 --> 01:37:34,650
That's why I announced my graduation.

2381
01:37:36,010 --> 01:37:37,090
And then I came back.

2382
01:37:37,170 --> 01:37:37,590
It's okay.

2383
01:37:40,110 --> 01:37:40,810
It's okay.

2384
01:37:40,870 --> 01:37:41,450
It's all good.

2385
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:42,290
I came back.

2386
01:37:43,130 --> 01:37:43,610
So...

2387
01:37:44,050 --> 01:37:44,290
Yeah.

2388
01:37:46,710 --> 01:37:47,590
We're here.

2389
01:37:47,850 --> 01:37:48,530
We're here now.

2390
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:50,350
As a family.

2391
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:53,950
We're here now as a family.

2392
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:55,250
So...

2393
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:02,040
I have some things I would like to announce.

2394
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:03,960
Um...

2395
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:06,820
Uh...

2396
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:10,160
Some of my...

2397
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:11,780
Well, okay.

2398
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:12,350
So...

2399
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:16,540
I'm still trying to figure out how to open up the store.

2400
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:19,120
And um...

2401
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:21,960
You'll see from the pictures as well.

2402
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:24,600
That some of the stuff is not completed as well.

2403
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:26,220
But...

2404
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:27,460
But...

2405
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:28,500
Um...

2406
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:30,340
There is stuff...

2407
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:32,020
Perhaps that I will...

2408
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:33,860
We will be selling in the future!

2409
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:35,760
Merch!

2410
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:37,880
Merch!

2411
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:38,260
Merch!

2412
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:38,920
Merch!

2413
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:42,320
And I will share with you what the merch will be.

2414
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:47,080
Some of these will be on my own store.

2415
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:49,600
Some of these will be in other locations.

2416
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:55,080
And of course I will spam everywhere where you will be able to get the stuff as soon as it's available.

2417
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:56,860
But I have three...

2418
01:38:58,060 --> 01:38:59,020
Three things...

2419
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:01,080
For now.

2420
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:03,400
Yes.

2421
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:12,220
And first, if you were in the membership stream, you will have seen...

2422
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:12,820
Ta-da!

2423
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:17,680
Mint plushie!

2424
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:20,640
Mint!

2425
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:26,240
Official mint plushie that you can take and grab and go on the Minto2go everywhere.

2426
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,020
Very throwable, yes, yes.

2427
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:31,420
You can take it anywhere.

2428
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:32,000
You can take it anywhere.

2429
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:33,400
You can take all your fun pictures with it.

2430
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:36,520
And all the cool things.

2431
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:39,500
It's about 9 centimeters.

2432
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:40,800
So...

2433
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:43,180
Very portable!

2434
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:45,620
Very squeezable, yes, yes.

2435
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:47,160
Yes.

2436
01:39:47,540 --> 01:39:48,100
And...

2437
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:48,980
So...

2438
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:49,960
Here's the back.

2439
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:50,780
One second.

2440
01:39:54,140 --> 01:39:55,140
Here's the back.

2441
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:58,180
Look at that!

2442
01:39:58,460 --> 01:39:59,060
Look at that!

2443
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:03,280
I was supposed to have a sample for...

2444
01:40:03,820 --> 01:40:05,520
That was being sent to me today.

2445
01:40:05,820 --> 01:40:08,800
I was gonna like show you with my real hands.

2446
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:10,980
But unfortunately...

2447
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:13,880
It didn't arrive on time.

2448
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:14,780
So...

2449
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:18,180
I believe the plushie will be on somebody else's site.

2450
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:22,120
Of course, I will give you all the details.

2451
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:25,440
But the person I've been working with has been so awesome.

2452
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:28,240
I thought maybe it would be done in time.

2453
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:29,240
For today.

2454
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:30,920
To be like...

2455
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:31,340
Like...

2456
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:32,500
It would be in my...

2457
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:34,140
Like the inventory would be in my possession.

2458
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:35,460
But...

2459
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:37,240
Actually, the vendor...

2460
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:39,540
The designer and everything.

2461
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:44,840
They spent a really long time trying to find someone that would do the gradient in my hair.

2462
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,360
Which is really nice because...

2463
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:50,840
I like that part.

2464
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:53,240
And so they worked really hard to...

2465
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:54,680
To...

2466
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:56,380
Here, I'll zoom...

2467
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:58,220
I'll make it big again so you guys can see.

2468
01:40:58,220 --> 01:40:58,540
See it?

2469
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,560
It's so cute, isn't it?

2470
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:02,240
It's so grab-able.

2471
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:04,480
So...

2472
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:07,360
I hope you...

2473
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:10,360
Will grab your little mint and...

2474
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:11,880
Grab her and shake her.

2475
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:12,920
Yeah.

2476
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:14,600
Grab her and shake her.

2477
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:15,520
Oh, wait, hold on.

2478
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:17,060
Actually, I'll put it like right here.

2479
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:18,140
Ta-da!

2480
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:21,280
So...

2481
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,020
I don't quite have a date for when all of these...

2482
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:26,540
There will be pre-orders first as well.

2483
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:27,640
They won't be like...

2484
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:29,160
They won't be...

2485
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:31,180
Like...

2486
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:35,360
So you will probably have to wait some time before you get them.

2487
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:36,040
I'm really sorry.

2488
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:37,940
But...

2489
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:39,860
But...

2490
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:44,900
I will get it to you eventually.

2491
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:47,660
And I don't...

2492
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:49,560
I'm not quite sure of when the shop will open.

2493
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:51,520
When everything will be up as well.

2494
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:55,020
But of course, like I said, I'll post it on the community tab.

2495
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:56,420
I'll post it on Twitter.

2496
01:41:56,420 --> 01:41:58,080
I'll have it on the menu.

2497
01:41:58,360 --> 01:41:59,420
It will be...

2498
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:01,140
Everywhere.

2499
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:02,360
That you...

2500
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,280
That I can post it.

2501
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:05,700
So yeah.

2502
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:06,940
Eventually.

2503
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:07,860
Eventually.

2504
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:10,140
I'm looking to ship...

2505
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:11,620
Wherever I can.

2506
01:42:12,740 --> 01:42:13,300
For...

2507
01:42:14,380 --> 01:42:16,600
The stuff that I will be shipping out myself.

2508
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:18,280
I planned to be doing international.

2509
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:20,660
But again...

2510
01:42:21,820 --> 01:42:23,560
I'm working stuff out.

2511
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:24,340
So...

2512
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:26,100
So...

2513
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:28,200
Yes.

2514
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:30,920
Doing everything myself.

2515
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:31,620
So you know.

2516
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:32,460
Antarctica.

2517
01:42:32,540 --> 01:42:33,040
Let's go.

2518
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:35,640
But yeah.

2519
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:36,780
So plushy.

2520
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:37,740
The next thing.

2521
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:40,400
This actually...

2522
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:42,040
I believe it was announced right before stream.

2523
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:43,100
But I have...

2524
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:45,920
Oh my gosh.

2525
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:47,460
The picture is humongous.

2526
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:50,680
One second.

2527
01:42:51,940 --> 01:42:52,540
Ta-da.

2528
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:53,000
Ta -da.

2529
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:56,340
An official mint happy.

2530
01:42:57,780 --> 01:42:58,420
Happy.

2531
01:42:58,520 --> 01:42:58,920
Happy.

2532
01:42:59,080 --> 01:42:59,320
Happy.

2533
01:42:59,320 --> 01:42:59,400
Yeah.

2534
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:02,660
Official mint happy.

2535
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:04,900
Akiba's custom made.

2536
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:06,680
And...

2537
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:08,360
The art is by Maru.

2538
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:11,480
And it's got my signature down there.

2539
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:12,300
And...

2540
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:13,140
This...

2541
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:14,540
This will not be on my store.

2542
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:15,880
But it will be...

2543
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:19,720
Also maybe...

2544
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:21,660
Available at certain conventions.

2545
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:22,160
Like...

2546
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:22,340
If...

2547
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:25,180
If the vendor will be at the convention as well.

2548
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:26,460
So...

2549
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:27,140
Yeah.

2550
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:28,900
The art is really really cute.

2551
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:29,920
I love the design.

2552
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:30,840
I like how it's like...

2553
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:31,400
Kind of spooky.

2554
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:31,900
And...

2555
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:32,720
And soft.

2556
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:33,720
And the chocolate.

2557
01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:35,440
And the wisps.

2558
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:35,940
And everything.

2559
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:37,040
They're so cute.

2560
01:43:38,180 --> 01:43:38,660
So...

2561
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:40,580
And the little gravestones.

2562
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:41,100
Everything.

2563
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:41,700
I love...

2564
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:42,560
I love it so much.

2565
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:44,580
So...

2566
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:45,320
Yeah.

2567
01:43:45,620 --> 01:43:48,200
The tombstones are unexpectedly metal.

2568
01:43:50,020 --> 01:43:50,780
So yeah.

2569
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:51,960
That will be...

2570
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:54,420
That will be...

2571
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,100
On sale eventually.

2572
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:03,560
I don't think Otakutan will be...

2573
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:05,820
I don't think it will be done in time for Otakutan unfortunately.

2574
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:06,680
But...

2575
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:07,920
I would say...

2576
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:09,800
For mostly everything...

2577
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:12,200
Within...

2578
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:13,300
By...

2579
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:13,920
I would say...

2580
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:14,800
End of the year.

2581
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:16,660
Which I know it's kind of early to be...

2582
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:17,800
Announcing...

2583
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:18,160
Oh wait.

2584
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:19,820
Let me make this small as well too.

2585
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:20,260
And then...

2586
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:21,820
I know it's kind of early to be announcing.

2587
01:44:21,820 --> 01:44:21,940
But...

2588
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:22,160
I'm going to be announcing it.

2589
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:22,980
And then being like...

2590
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:23,320
Oh yeah.

2591
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:24,520
You'll get it by the end of the year.

2592
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:25,220
But...

2593
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:25,680
You know.

2594
01:44:25,740 --> 01:44:27,560
Merch stuff takes a while to create.

2595
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:28,860
And things like...

2596
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:30,040
And things like that.

2597
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:31,200
So...

2598
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:31,920
Um...

2599
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:32,400
Mm-hmm.

2600
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:36,400
I appreciate your patience.

2601
01:44:36,420 --> 01:44:38,280
It's also my first time ever like making merch.

2602
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:38,840
So...

2603
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:40,360
It's been...

2604
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:42,540
It's been a very...

2605
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:45,480
Learning curve.

2606
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:47,560
It's been an...

2607
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:48,440
It's been a...

2608
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:50,200
A learning curve for sure.

2609
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:50,980
Yeah.

2610
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:51,920
Yeah.

2611
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:52,820
Um...

2612
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:55,460
The next thing...

2613
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:56,340
Okay.

2614
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:57,660
I'm going to move the notifs again.

2615
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:00,120
Put you over here.

2616
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:04,320
Um...

2617
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,260
The next thing...

2618
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:07,220
I have...

2619
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:08,780
Is...

2620
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:09,180
Uh...

2621
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:11,240
Okay.

2622
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:13,320
So this one you'll see of course...

2623
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:14,560
That it's not done.

2624
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:15,900
It's still in...

2625
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:17,120
The sketch phase.

2626
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:18,380
But...

2627
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:18,780
Um...

2628
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:20,320
It is...

2629
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:21,280
Will be...

2630
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:21,920
I don't know.

2631
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:22,960
Completed eventually.

2632
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:26,600
But...

2633
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:26,740
Um...

2634
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:27,220
Oh gosh.

2635
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,560
I'm kind of nervous about this one.

2636
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:29,160
I actually...

2637
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:30,120
I censored...

2638
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:30,260
No.

2639
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:31,060
I didn't censor it.

2640
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:31,320
I...

2641
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:32,860
Since it's a sketch...

2642
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:33,600
I didn't want...

2643
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,280
And the design is not final.

2644
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:36,880
I kind of blurred it just a little bit.

2645
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:39,160
Ta-da!

2646
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:52,800
Mint dakimakura!

2647
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:55,920
As you can see...

2648
01:45:57,120 --> 01:45:57,520
I'm going to...

2649
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:58,280
Um...

2650
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:01,040
Onii-chan daisuki!

2651
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:01,800
Thanks for the buy!

2652
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:01,980
Get it!

2653
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:04,040
Um...

2654
01:46:04,860 --> 01:46:05,380
Yep!

2655
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:07,320
The dakimakura.

2656
01:46:07,420 --> 01:46:10,080
You can see the side A and the side B.

2657
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:12,640
And um...

2658
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:14,380
It's so funny because...

2659
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:16,340
The artist is Deyui.

2660
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:21,000
And uh...

2661
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:23,160
It's so blurred.

2662
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:24,040
We can't see the moles.

2663
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:25,300
I can kind of see it.

2664
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:27,500
Maybe...

2665
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:27,900
Maybe you can't.

2666
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:28,800
I can kind of see it.

2667
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:29,440
But they are there.

2668
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:30,520
Um...

2669
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:34,200
I had a different image in mind for the back side.

2670
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:36,880
And Deyui was just like...

2671
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:38,160
I think...

2672
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:40,680
We need to go beyond.

2673
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:44,060
I was like...

2674
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:44,580
Here hold on.

2675
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:45,100
I'm going to...

2676
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:45,880
I'm going to...

2677
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:46,840
There we go.

2678
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,120
So you can see me.

2679
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:49,320
I'm embarrassed.

2680
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:50,600
You're seeing old Mint.

2681
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:52,640
She can stay behind me.

2682
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,100
Like a go...

2683
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:55,080
Like she's haunting me.

2684
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,080
There we go.

2685
01:46:57,020 --> 01:46:57,500
I'm embarrassed.

2686
01:46:58,220 --> 01:46:59,360
There we go.

2687
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:00,760
There we go.

2688
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:01,920
Um...

2689
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:03,320
So...

2690
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:04,260
Um...

2691
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:06,300
You can thank Deyui...

2692
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:09,920
For...

2693
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:11,700
For the back side.

2694
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:13,560
Which I don't hate.

2695
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:15,320
I still think it's pretty cute.

2696
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:17,040
But um...

2697
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:19,740
She has a stand.

2698
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:22,240
Jojo!

2699
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:26,000
Um...

2700
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,500
Back side...

2701
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:28,420
Best side...

2702
01:47:30,220 --> 01:47:32,460
Any estimated pricings yet?

2703
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:34,480
I wish I could tell you.

2704
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:35,260
Um...

2705
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:37,320
Unfortunately I don't have anything set in stone.

2706
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:38,400
Um...

2707
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:39,220
But...

2708
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:42,780
Once it gets closer to everything I will of course...

2709
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:43,500
Um...

2710
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:44,320
Tell you guys.

2711
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:45,160
Um...

2712
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,180
Probably...

2713
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:47,180
You know...

2714
01:47:47,180 --> 01:47:47,560
I...

2715
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:48,220
I...

2716
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:49,160
Um...

2717
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:50,080
The Daki...

2718
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:51,200
You know...

2719
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:52,980
Probably be like normal Daki rates.

2720
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:53,540
You know...

2721
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:54,620
So...

2722
01:47:54,620 --> 01:47:55,920
Table dom!

2723
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:57,740
Thank you for the tenget and thank you!

2724
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:00,860
But yeah.

2725
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:01,600
So...

2726
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,420
My own Daki makura.

2727
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:04,800
It's a little...

2728
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:06,460
It's a little spicy!

2729
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:09,500
It's...

2730
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:11,840
It's a little spicy!

2731
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:16,960
But um...

2732
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:20,200
Um...

2733
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:22,320
I hope you guys will still like it.

2734
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:27,320
The other stuff is wholesome, so you know.

2735
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:28,780
The spice of life.

2736
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:30,780
Mint is basically a spice.

2737
01:48:34,930 --> 01:48:37,830
It's so embarrassing showing off something like this.

2738
01:48:40,150 --> 01:48:43,790
And there were even versions that were even spicier.

2739
01:48:44,690 --> 01:48:45,910
Than version C.

2740
01:48:47,570 --> 01:48:50,490
There were versions that I was like...

2741
01:48:52,950 --> 01:48:55,210
I don't think we can go this...

2742
01:48:55,210 --> 01:48:56,910
I don't think we can go this far.

2743
01:49:01,550 --> 01:49:02,350
There were...

2744
01:49:03,490 --> 01:49:03,890
The

2745
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:07,580
pig!

2746
01:49:07,860 --> 01:49:11,900
I still remember finding your Ace Attorney finale stream in the middle of the night 3 years ago.

2747
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:12,740
Oh my gosh, Pogman.

2748
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:13,440
Thank you!

2749
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:15,180
Thank you so much.

2750
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:18,080
Thank you, thank you.

2751
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,060
How about B and A?

2752
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:23,420
A was the spiciest... no, B was the spiciest.

2753
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:25,440
I'm not gonna show you guys.

2754
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:27,540
I'm not gonna show you guys.

2755
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:28,480
Because then you'll be like...

2756
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:30,680
This is what we could've had!

2757
01:49:34,030 --> 01:49:35,710
I'm not gonna show you guys.

2758
01:49:36,670 --> 01:49:38,230
Release the day we cut.

2759
01:49:41,410 --> 01:49:42,650
She hates us!

2760
01:49:44,050 --> 01:49:45,610
Show the director's cut!

2761
01:49:51,510 --> 01:49:52,870
Happy anniversary, Mintou.

2762
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:53,390
Thank you!

2763
01:49:54,750 --> 01:49:56,270
Thank you so much, Notorious!

2764
01:49:56,530 --> 01:49:57,970
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2765
01:49:59,730 --> 01:50:00,310
PSG.

2766
01:50:03,870 --> 01:50:04,890
Oh my gosh.

2767
01:50:04,970 --> 01:50:06,630
I'm giving it the peer pressure right now.

2768
01:50:07,770 --> 01:50:08,710
Okay, hold on.

2769
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:10,090
Hold on!

2770
01:50:13,010 --> 01:50:13,810
Hold on!

2771
01:50:14,190 --> 01:50:14,730
Hold!

2772
01:50:15,370 --> 01:50:15,910
Hold!

2773
01:50:16,090 --> 01:50:16,370
Hold!

2774
01:50:16,990 --> 01:50:17,870
I'll get it.

2775
01:50:20,510 --> 01:50:21,710
But I'm gonna hide.

2776
01:50:21,890 --> 01:50:22,750
Because I'm embarrassed.

2777
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:23,930
So...

2778
01:50:23,930 --> 01:50:25,890
I think my channel...

2779
01:50:25,890 --> 01:50:26,270
Oh gosh.

2780
01:50:26,370 --> 01:50:26,730
Okay.

2781
01:50:27,070 --> 01:50:27,870
Oh god.

2782
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:28,990
Oh god.

2783
01:50:32,150 --> 01:50:33,230
Oh god.

2784
01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:35,590
Okay.

2785
01:50:35,890 --> 01:50:36,150
So...

2786
01:50:36,150 --> 01:50:36,430
Just to...

2787
01:50:36,430 --> 01:50:37,470
I'm just gonna...

2788
01:50:41,430 --> 01:50:46,930
The comments are so funny that they wrote because this is just says, Emphasize ass.

2789
01:50:49,050 --> 01:50:52,580
Oh gosh.

2790
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:53,140
Okay.

2791
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:53,520
Okay.

2792
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:53,820
Okay.

2793
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:57,260
This is not what it will be.

2794
01:50:59,420 --> 01:50:59,900
Obviously.

2795
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:01,320
But...

2796
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:02,860
This is...

2797
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:03,600
This is one of the...

2798
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:04,660
This is what they sent me.

2799
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:05,400
And I was like...

2800
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:05,740
Um...

2801
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:09,380
I don't... I don't know about this one, chief.

2802
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:13,220
Oh gosh, oh gosh!

2803
01:51:13,460 --> 01:51:13,900
OK, OK.

2804
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:16,220
I'm disappearing.

2805
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,700
OK, go, go, go, go, go away!

2806
01:52:09,150 --> 01:52:09,630
Anyway...

2807
01:52:10,910 --> 01:52:11,390
Anyway...

2808
01:52:13,370 --> 01:52:13,850
Anyway...

2809
01:52:14,890 --> 01:52:16,570
That was one of the sketches.

2810
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:25,460
Too spicy for TV, true.

2811
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:28,960
Way too spicy, way too spicy.

2812
01:52:29,940 --> 01:52:32,660
And the last thing that I have is...

2813
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:35,680
Something that I think is kind of fun.

2814
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:36,920
Because...

2815
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:39,720
I've been so excited about this.

2816
01:52:39,780 --> 01:52:41,680
Maybe it's not the most exciting thing.

2817
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:43,640
But I've been very excited about it.

2818
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:44,620
Because...

2819
01:52:44,620 --> 01:52:48,480
I don't see very many people having merch like this.

2820
01:52:50,260 --> 01:52:50,660
So...

2821
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:53,260
And I think you guys will find it fun as well.

2822
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:58,620
So a couple of months ago, a company reached out to me.

2823
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:00,800
And... the Japanese company.

2824
01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:03,560
And at first, I was like nervous about responding.

2825
01:53:03,740 --> 01:53:04,840
I was just like, oh...

2826
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:06,420
I don't know...

2827
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:09,040
Can I work with them?

2828
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:11,820
Because, you know, the language barrier and...

2829
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:14,240
Working with Japanese company, this and that.

2830
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:16,360
But...

2831
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:21,220
I kind of got over my fear.

2832
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:22,000
And I was like, you know what?

2833
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:22,680
No.

2834
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:23,300
I will.

2835
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:23,940
I will.

2836
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:25,240
I will contact them.

2837
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:29,780
And so, I even hired a translator to work with me.

2838
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:32,520
And we've been going back and forth.

2839
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:33,760
And they've been so kind.

2840
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:34,320
And so...

2841
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:35,880
So...

2842
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:38,080
Fun to talk to and work with.

2843
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:39,120
So...

2844
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:41,960
It's not...

2845
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:45,360
It's not the most impressive thing, maybe.

2846
01:53:45,460 --> 01:53:47,480
And it's maybe not what you guys think.

2847
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:49,200
Who's saying Tenga?

2848
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:51,340
Where did this come from?

2849
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:52,180
Huh?

2850
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:54,700
No!

2851
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:55,500
It's wholesome!

2852
01:53:56,020 --> 01:53:56,500
Stop!

2853
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:00,940
It's wholesome!

2854
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,040
It's wholesome.

2855
01:54:07,530 --> 01:54:08,170
But...

2856
01:54:08,170 --> 01:54:09,930
So, again...

2857
01:54:09,930 --> 01:54:10,810
I think I'm...

2858
01:54:10,810 --> 01:54:11,530
You know...

2859
01:54:11,530 --> 01:54:13,930
Maybe it's not so impressive, like I said.

2860
01:54:14,050 --> 01:54:14,310
But...

2861
01:54:14,310 --> 01:54:18,930
To me, it's been a lot of work that I've been putting into it.

2862
01:54:19,110 --> 01:54:19,510
So...

2863
01:54:19,610 --> 01:54:22,630
To me, it feels a little bit more special.

2864
01:54:23,070 --> 01:54:24,970
But basically, the...

2865
01:54:25,870 --> 01:54:26,830
One second...

2866
01:54:32,350 --> 01:54:32,990
The...

2867
01:54:35,170 --> 01:54:37,170
The company is called...

2868
01:54:37,170 --> 01:54:38,570
Mitako Block.

2869
01:54:40,370 --> 01:54:41,290
Mitakuru Block.

2870
01:54:42,350 --> 01:54:44,630
And we've been working together to create...

2871
01:54:45,390 --> 01:54:45,830
Da da da...

2872
01:54:45,830 --> 01:54:46,550
Oh, wait...

2873
01:54:46,550 --> 01:54:47,030
Uh...

2874
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:48,610
Da da da...

2875
01:54:48,610 --> 01:54:49,610
Da da da da...

2876
01:54:49,610 --> 01:54:50,270
Ta-da!

2877
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:52,650
Lego Mito!

2878
01:54:58,080 --> 01:54:58,700
It's your...

2879
01:54:58,700 --> 01:54:59,020
You...

2880
01:54:59,020 --> 01:55:03,820
You know how, like, there's, like, the Pokemon, like, little Legos and things like that?

2881
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:04,920
And...

2882
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:07,640
So, I thought, I really like those.

2883
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:09,840
And I even have, like, a Neptunia one.

2884
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:11,900
So, when I got this offer, I was like...

2885
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:13,380
This is so cute!

2886
01:55:13,540 --> 01:55:14,620
I can have my own!

2887
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:17,760
And then you will get the pieces and you get to assemble it yourself.

2888
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:19,040
So...

2889
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:20,900
You can have your own little...

2890
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:22,540
Mint DIY project.

2891
01:55:24,260 --> 01:55:24,820
Yeah!

2892
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:25,600
Yeah, yeah.

2893
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:26,480
Like the Nano Block.

2894
01:55:28,860 --> 01:55:29,420
So...

2895
01:55:29,420 --> 01:55:30,280
I thought...

2896
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:33,060
I thought this was kind of, like, a fun little...

2897
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:35,180
Fun little thing that you can also...

2898
01:55:35,180 --> 01:55:36,080
Put together.

2899
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:37,280
It's...

2900
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:38,420
It's quite small.

2901
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:40,760
I think it's like...

2902
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:43,020
Three inches...

2903
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:43,760
It's like, you know...

2904
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:45,040
It's quite small.

2905
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:45,940
So...

2906
01:55:45,940 --> 01:55:47,820
You can put it on your desk.

2907
01:55:47,820 --> 01:55:50,460
You can put it on your bookshelf.

2908
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:51,260
You know...

2909
01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:53,320
You can put it wherever you...

2910
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:55,440
Wherever you want.

2911
01:55:56,540 --> 01:55:57,140
Small.

2912
01:55:57,420 --> 01:55:58,340
Small, small, small.

2913
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:01,820
So, yeah.

2914
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,460
How does it taste, though?

2915
01:56:05,900 --> 01:56:06,500
Like...

2916
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:08,020
Plastic, probably.

2917
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:11,700
Three inches isn't small.

2918
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:14,020
Yes!

2919
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:15,380
It's versatile.

2920
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:17,500
And it's...

2921
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:18,040
Portable!

2922
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:20,260
It's portable!

2923
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:20,800
It's portable!

2924
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:22,420
So...

2925
01:56:22,420 --> 01:56:23,100
Yeah!

2926
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:24,320
I was...

2927
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:25,660
I've been really excited about it.

2928
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:26,140
Um...

2929
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:27,500
Uh...

2930
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:28,880
They...

2931
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:29,440
They...

2932
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:30,620
They were just like...

2933
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:31,080
Just...

2934
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:31,520
You know...

2935
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:34,460
Make sure you tell them that it'll be shipped out in this amount of time.

2936
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:34,940
And...

2937
01:56:34,940 --> 01:56:35,900
And so...

2938
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:36,460
Um...

2939
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:38,460
Uh...

2940
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:40,060
I imagine...

2941
01:56:40,060 --> 01:56:41,900
I'll probably get them around...

2942
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:42,520
Uh...

2943
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:43,080
Uh...

2944
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:43,940
Around...

2945
01:56:43,940 --> 01:56:44,320
Um...

2946
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:46,140
Uh...

2947
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:46,620
Some...

2948
01:56:46,620 --> 01:56:47,860
End of August, maybe?

2949
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:48,720
So...

2950
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:49,680
Uh...

2951
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:49,820
Uh...

2952
01:56:49,820 --> 01:56:52,560
We're working on getting it shipped out to me.

2953
01:56:52,640 --> 01:56:53,360
All the pieces.

2954
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:54,360
Um...

2955
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:54,640
Oh!

2956
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:55,820
I also want to mention...

2957
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:56,480
That...

2958
01:56:57,320 --> 01:56:57,840
Um...

2959
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:58,280
Uh...

2960
01:56:59,140 --> 01:56:59,660
So...

2961
01:56:59,660 --> 01:57:00,660
For...

2962
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:01,360
Um...

2963
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:02,980
For...

2964
01:57:02,980 --> 01:57:04,640
The little LEGO pieces...

2965
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:05,260
The...

2966
01:57:05,260 --> 01:57:06,700
The mythical block ones...

2967
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:06,940
Sorry.

2968
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:09,140
I probably shouldn't say LEGO because that's like...

2969
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:11,660
That's like copyrighted, isn't it?

2970
01:57:11,740 --> 01:57:12,200
Um...

2971
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:13,300
It is going to be...

2972
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:13,900
Um...

2973
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:14,040
Um...

2974
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:14,340
Limited.

2975
01:57:14,980 --> 01:57:15,660
Uh...

2976
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:16,420
But...

2977
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:17,260
But...

2978
01:57:17,260 --> 01:57:18,440
For all of this...

2979
01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:19,000
Probably...

2980
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:19,660
You know...

2981
01:57:19,660 --> 01:57:19,960
Um...

2982
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:21,280
We can do multiple runs.

2983
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:23,660
I'm not sure how much of stuff we'll sell.

2984
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:24,800
So...

2985
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:25,340
Um...

2986
01:57:27,180 --> 01:57:27,860
So...

2987
01:57:27,860 --> 01:57:28,820
I'm just kind of...

2988
01:57:28,820 --> 01:57:29,460
Seeing...

2989
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:31,060
I'm testing the waters...

2990
01:57:31,060 --> 01:57:32,700
To get an idea...

2991
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:33,040
Of...

2992
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:34,320
What...

2993
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:34,760
What...

2994
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:35,940
What to expect...

2995
01:57:37,060 --> 01:57:37,740
Um...

2996
01:57:37,740 --> 01:57:38,960
But yeah!

2997
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:41,640
Legally distinct block toy.

2998
01:57:41,860 --> 01:57:42,460
Um...

2999
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:43,880
Um...

3000
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:45,060
Um...

3001
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:45,800
Uh...

3002
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:46,320
So yeah!

3003
01:57:46,860 --> 01:57:47,540
Um...

3004
01:57:47,540 --> 01:57:49,180
I hope you guys...

3005
01:57:49,180 --> 01:57:49,460
L...

3006
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:50,080
Like...

3007
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:51,340
The stuff...

3008
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:52,240
Um...

3009
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:53,200
The merch...

3010
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:54,200
My first ever...

3011
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:55,440
My first ever...

3012
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:55,940
Well...

3013
01:57:55,940 --> 01:57:57,400
I guess if you don't count the...

3014
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:57,760
Um...

3015
01:57:57,760 --> 01:57:59,820
My first ever solo merch launch...

3016
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:00,360
Because...

3017
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:02,120
The Patreon was with Matara...

3018
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:02,780
Or...

3019
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:03,180
Not sorry...

3020
01:58:03,180 --> 01:58:03,580
The Patreon...

3021
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:04,580
The podcast was with...

3022
01:58:04,580 --> 01:58:05,680
Matara...

3023
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:07,340
But it's my first ever...

3024
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:08,680
Personal...

3025
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:10,120
It's my first ever time...

3026
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:10,460
Like...

3027
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:12,180
Doing my own merch...

3028
01:58:12,180 --> 01:58:12,600
And...

3029
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:13,360
Um...

3030
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:14,780
And...

3031
01:58:14,780 --> 01:58:15,180
Uh...

3032
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:15,780
There's...

3033
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:16,480
There's more...

3034
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:17,940
Coming in the future as well...

3035
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:19,400
So if you're just like...

3036
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:20,000
Um...

3037
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:20,600
I'm already...

3038
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:20,860
I'm...

3039
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:22,060
I am in talks with...

3040
01:58:22,060 --> 01:58:22,860
Perhaps...

3041
01:58:22,860 --> 01:58:24,680
Some other places as well...

3042
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:25,480
So...

3043
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:26,520
Um...

3044
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:28,140
Uh...

3045
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:28,800
But...

3046
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:29,400
You know...

3047
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:30,180
Um...

3048
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:32,200
Yes...

3049
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:33,260
It's...

3050
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:33,840
It's kind of...

3051
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:35,320
There's some things that...

3052
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:35,980
Um...

3053
01:58:35,980 --> 01:58:36,480
I...

3054
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:37,680
I also didn't want to...

3055
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:39,200
I didn't want to...

3056
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:40,320
Um...

3057
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,880
Start off too much...

3058
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:43,220
And overwhelm myself...

3059
01:58:45,380 --> 01:58:46,900
Me from three years ago...

3060
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:47,760
Would have been so jealous...

3061
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:49,460
We got mint merch...

3062
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:51,640
Oh my gosh...

3063
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:52,080
Paperbacks!

3064
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:53,040
Thank you for the Onkosupa!

3065
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:55,880
Thanks for being here...

3066
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:56,820
And being silly with us...

3067
01:58:56,820 --> 01:58:57,840
Thank you...

3068
01:58:59,340 --> 01:58:59,940
Thank you...

3069
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:00,460
Thank you...

3070
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:01,500
Um...

3071
01:59:02,660 --> 01:59:03,120
Oh...

3072
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:06,180
Um...

3073
01:59:06,180 --> 01:59:06,940
But yeah...

3074
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:08,520
Take my money...

3075
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:08,860
No!

3076
01:59:09,380 --> 01:59:09,840
No!

3077
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:10,020
No!

3078
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:10,300
No!

3079
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:11,140
Thank you!

3080
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:13,100
Mint from three years ago would die looking at that...

3081
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,440
I'm already dying...

3082
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:16,440
Not gonna lie...

3083
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:17,720
I'm kind of just like...

3084
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:20,140
Maybe it's a little outside my comfort zone...

3085
01:59:20,140 --> 01:59:20,800
But um...

3086
01:59:21,660 --> 01:59:22,560
But um...

3087
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:26,060
But...

3088
01:59:26,060 --> 01:59:27,180
You know...

3089
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:29,340
I'm not a freak phantom for nothing, right?

3090
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:32,320
Oh...

3091
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:34,340
There we go...

3092
01:59:34,340 --> 01:59:36,580
Not freak phantom for nothing...

3093
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:37,600
Haha...

3094
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:37,840
Haha...

3095
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:48,160
The pre-orders for all this stuff, probably will have pre-orders open sometime next month.

3096
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:52,240
And then the orders will be shipped out a few months from then.

3097
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:58,740
I hope you guys don't mind me being slow and I appreciate your patience with everything.

3098
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:02,800
And all that, Official Freak Phantom Glasses win!

3099
02:00:09,460 --> 02:00:15,020
I appreciate you guys always being so patient with me and everything.

3100
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:17,240
How many plushies can I buy?

3101
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:23,060
People say that they are going to buy an amount, but they don't actually...

3102
02:00:23,060 --> 02:00:25,280
They're just kidding, you know?

3103
02:00:25,700 --> 02:00:26,220
So...

3104
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:32,980
As for the plushies, I definitely think multiple runs will be okay.

3105
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:39,580
Hold on...

3106
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:48,540
But you know, if you...

3107
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:50,100
I'm not kidding!

3108
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:56,640
If you don't buy anything, that's totally okay too.

3109
02:00:56,800 --> 02:01:00,160
You know, just being here watching is always more than enough.

3110
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:03,160
Just having your support...

3111
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:03,680
Thank you!

3112
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:04,760
Oh, Spooky!

3113
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:06,560
Thank you so much, Akira!

3114
02:01:06,660 --> 02:01:07,160
Thank you!

3115
02:01:07,340 --> 02:01:08,480
Okay, here's a tip too!

3116
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:11,540
And yeah...

3117
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:13,900
So, of course, I always...

3118
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:17,920
I always appreciate just any sort of support.

3119
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:20,700
You watching, watching the VODs...

3120
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:22,940
Donating merch...

3121
02:01:22,940 --> 02:01:24,780
Whatever, whatever, whatever...

3122
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:27,420
I'm buying a bigger jar!

3123
02:01:29,780 --> 02:01:30,280
Jason!

3124
02:01:31,220 --> 02:01:32,400
Thank you for the 10!

3125
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:33,760
Thank you so much!

3126
02:01:36,610 --> 02:01:39,330
Don't give your money to me, give your money to Yuu-chan!

3127
02:01:39,330 --> 02:01:42,550
What are you doing?

3128
02:01:43,310 --> 02:01:44,350
What are you doing?

3129
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:45,430
Give your money to Yuu-chan!

3130
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:50,350
But...

3131
02:01:51,270 --> 02:01:51,710
Yeah!

3132
02:01:53,650 --> 02:01:55,210
I don't really know what else.

3133
02:01:55,330 --> 02:01:57,030
Sorry that I didn't have so much prepared.

3134
02:01:58,470 --> 02:01:59,390
Thank you too!

3135
02:01:59,810 --> 02:02:00,550
Thank you!

3136
02:02:01,550 --> 02:02:01,990
And...

3137
02:02:04,070 --> 02:02:06,130
I'm going to buy even more plushies than before.

3138
02:02:06,670 --> 02:02:07,490
No, please!

3139
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:09,470
I don't know how much they're going to be.

3140
02:02:10,010 --> 02:02:11,490
I don't know how much they're going to be.

3141
02:02:12,550 --> 02:02:13,490
Stop saying sorry.

3142
02:02:14,950 --> 02:02:15,310
Okay...

3143
02:02:15,310 --> 02:02:15,990
Sorry!

3144
02:02:17,410 --> 02:02:18,730
I'm sorry for saying sorry!

3145
02:02:19,470 --> 02:02:22,210
I'm going to eat some food real quick because I'm starting to get a little hungry.

3146
02:02:23,170 --> 02:02:24,010
Spite is powerful.

3147
02:02:24,290 --> 02:02:24,670
You know what?

3148
02:02:24,690 --> 02:02:25,150
That is true.

3149
02:02:26,830 --> 02:02:27,530
That is true.

3150
02:02:28,230 --> 02:02:29,490
I think I'm just mostly...

3151
02:02:33,330 --> 02:02:34,990
I just feel so...

3152
02:02:35,450 --> 02:02:36,070
Okay, hold on.

3153
02:02:36,110 --> 02:02:36,950
It's time to get sappy.

3154
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:37,670
Hold on.

3155
02:02:37,730 --> 02:02:39,390
I'm going to turn the sappy music on.

3156
02:02:39,510 --> 02:02:41,310
I already feel the tears rising up in my...

3157
02:02:42,610 --> 02:02:44,710
I already feel my tears rising up.

3158
02:02:46,290 --> 02:02:47,650
Rise of the tears.

3159
02:02:49,810 --> 02:02:50,830
Where is my music?

3160
02:02:52,010 --> 02:02:52,530
Wait...

3161
02:02:52,530 --> 02:02:53,430
Oh, here we go.

3162
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:00,520
This one maybe?

3163
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:13,400
Okay.

3164
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:15,540
Hold, Mint!

3165
02:03:15,640 --> 02:03:15,920
Hold!

3166
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:18,280
Hold!

3167
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:19,880
Hold!

3168
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:23,900
I already, you know, I feel already so grateful.

3169
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:31,980
That metal tear rising up.

3170
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:33,700
That you guys are here.

3171
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:38,580
And that you guys are watching at all.

3172
02:03:52,260 --> 02:03:53,540
And that...

3173
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:54,380
And that...

3174
02:03:54,380 --> 02:03:55,360
And that...

3175
02:03:57,340 --> 02:03:57,520
And that...

3176
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:01,120
And that...

3177
02:04:01,120 --> 02:04:01,620
It's been...

3178
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:04,180
It's been...

3179
02:04:04,180 --> 02:04:07,140
I don't want to say tumultuous time.

3180
02:04:08,050 --> 02:04:09,220
Basically, I left.

3181
02:04:09,380 --> 02:04:11,220
And I came back maybe...

3182
02:04:12,030 --> 02:04:12,800
somewhat different.

3183
02:04:14,360 --> 02:04:17,040
I don't know what you're talking about.

3184
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:18,300
But...

3185
02:04:19,860 --> 02:04:20,720
But...

3186
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:21,740
But...

3187
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:24,180
But, uh...

3188
02:04:24,180 --> 02:04:25,740
Oh, now I do have an idea.

3189
02:04:27,580 --> 02:04:56,640
You know, so many people here that are, um, even, uh, uh, still, um, sorry, um, still willing to give me a chance, um, uh, sorry.

3190
02:04:58,460 --> 02:05:21,580
It was just, it's been kind of a crazy year, and so I'm really happy that I could finally celebrate my anniversary, even though I'm three years late, and I'm sorry I couldn't celebrate it before, and maybe there are people here that didn't watch me before,

3191
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:27,100
so, um, now I'm glad that we could, um,

3192
02:05:30,860 --> 02:05:33,880
uh, instead celebrate it all together.

3193
02:05:35,540 --> 02:05:36,700
Are those keys?

3194
02:05:39,220 --> 02:05:42,700
Are those keys to Metal Gear Solid?

3195
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:47,600
No way, are you just, oh, thank you for reminding me.

3196
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:51,020
I can't believe you just gave away keys for the game, yes.

3197
02:05:57,480 --> 02:05:58,080
Uh...

3198
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:04,160
YouTube recommended me one of your streams way back, but I was a hater.

3199
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:05,800
You were a hater?

3200
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:10,080
That's okay.

3201
02:06:10,300 --> 02:06:11,480
I would be a hater, too.

3202
02:06:11,980 --> 02:06:15,820
You see cringe, uh, cringe, cringe anime.

3203
02:06:16,540 --> 02:06:19,860
Girl, do wish I could have stayed a member all three years.

3204
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,800
Why, how could I do that, though?

3205
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:27,140
How could I just have my memberships open for all that time?

3206
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:30,140
But, um...

3207
02:06:37,660 --> 02:06:38,240
Uh...

3208
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:40,840
Oh my gosh!

3209
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:41,820
Tom!

3210
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:43,560
Happy anniversary, boss!

3211
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:44,540
Thank you!

3212
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:48,560
Oh my gosh, I used your thing for the stream!

3213
02:06:49,100 --> 02:06:52,020
I was like, your, your thing for VTube Studio!

3214
02:06:53,160 --> 02:06:55,680
I was like, oh my gosh, Tom developed this?

3215
02:06:56,020 --> 02:06:57,000
That's crazy!

3216
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:59,620
Thank you!

3217
02:07:02,340 --> 02:07:02,920
Um...

3218
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:05,840
I recently found the channel, but glad to have found you, man!

3219
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:06,500
Thank you!

3220
02:07:06,680 --> 02:07:07,960
Love for Metal Gear is strong!

3221
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:08,780
Frank Hunter!

3222
02:07:13,400 --> 02:07:13,920
Um...

3223
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:14,420
Huh?

3224
02:07:17,540 --> 02:07:18,060
Tom!

3225
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:23,840
I'm so happy to see you again.

3226
02:07:24,860 --> 02:07:26,000
Thank you so much.

3227
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:28,080
Thank you.

3228
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:30,600
Until now.

3229
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:30,980
I'm on my day.

3230
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:33,540
Um...

3231
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:35,680
You know...

3232
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:37,420
Even if you find me today...

3233
02:07:38,100 --> 02:07:39,360
Even if you're just like...

3234
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:44,140
Even if you're like, I just came upon this stream and this ghost seems kind of cool and kind of funky!

3235
02:07:44,720 --> 02:07:47,740
You know, appreciated that too and...

3236
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:50,760
I just, uh...

3237
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:55,820
I just, uh, I just, I just am so grateful that, um...

3238
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:58,720
You guys haven't given up on me...

3239
02:08:04,890 --> 02:08:32,550
I can keep haunting you guys for some time and maybe I should just say it I've kind of have been I have been I have been kind of like I mean things have been I've been slow because I... I... I've been trying to decide what to do.

3240
02:08:34,210 --> 02:08:36,350
I've been trying to decide what to do with everything.

3241
02:08:36,910 --> 02:08:41,510
But I think... I think I've found my footing a little bit.

3242
02:08:42,610 --> 02:08:43,430
A little bit.

3243
02:08:44,990 --> 02:08:46,450
And even... I will say this.

3244
02:08:46,590 --> 02:08:47,130
I will give a hint.

3245
02:08:47,410 --> 02:08:48,290
I will give a hint.

3246
02:08:48,690 --> 02:08:52,490
Even if my appearance changes just a little bit.

3247
02:08:54,170 --> 02:08:55,890
Just... a little bit.

3248
02:08:57,270 --> 02:08:58,370
Not too dramatic.

3249
02:08:59,950 --> 02:09:04,610
I hope that you guys will still...

3250
02:09:07,130 --> 02:09:07,770
Still...

3251
02:09:07,770 --> 02:09:09,810
Hint phantom.

3252
02:09:12,130 --> 02:09:15,530
I hope you guys will still stick around.

3253
02:09:19,730 --> 02:09:21,530
But that's not for a while.

3254
02:09:24,250 --> 02:09:24,690
Um...

3255
02:09:25,530 --> 02:09:25,970
Surgery?

3256
02:09:26,150 --> 02:09:26,410
No!

3257
02:09:28,190 --> 02:09:30,290
I just... I... I don't know.

3258
02:09:30,370 --> 02:09:31,270
I can't...

3259
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:42,820
I just... can't... really thank you guys enough.

3260
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:43,980
3.0?

3261
02:09:46,220 --> 02:09:47,220
What's going on?

3262
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:54,060
I think you guys... I think you guys might like the change too.

3263
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:54,640
A little bit.

3264
02:09:54,860 --> 02:09:56,080
Like I said, it's not a huge change.

3265
02:09:56,980 --> 02:09:57,460
Um...

3266
02:09:58,320 --> 02:09:59,440
Not a huge change.

3267
02:10:00,980 --> 02:10:02,400
You'll see when it happens.

3268
02:10:03,380 --> 02:10:03,860
Um...

3269
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:07,540
BBL?

3270
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:08,260
BBL confirmed?

3271
02:10:10,540 --> 02:10:11,520
I'm a newer fan.

3272
02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:12,140
Oh no!

3273
02:10:12,260 --> 02:10:12,840
Thank you Jose!

3274
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:13,420
Thank you!

3275
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:15,600
2.5?

3276
02:10:15,700 --> 02:10:17,740
2.5 I think is a good way to put it.

3277
02:10:19,940 --> 02:10:20,420
Um...

3278
02:10:21,340 --> 02:10:22,440
We're getting a BBL.

3279
02:10:22,780 --> 02:10:24,040
That's my next thing.

3280
02:10:24,300 --> 02:10:25,320
I'm going to Brazil!

3281
02:10:25,320 --> 02:10:25,720
Brazil!

3282
02:10:33,400 --> 02:10:33,920
Um...

3283
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,240
I still... and I... um...

3284
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:43,360
I guess I apologize so much because, you know, I feel that you guys have...

3285
02:10:44,260 --> 02:10:44,780
Um...

3286
02:10:45,980 --> 02:10:47,720
You guys have changed my afterlife.

3287
02:10:47,940 --> 02:10:49,240
You guys have changed my whole world.

3288
02:10:49,820 --> 02:10:50,800
And um...

3289
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:56,100
All I want for you guys is... um...

3290
02:10:57,420 --> 02:10:58,380
Is to...

3291
02:10:59,940 --> 02:11:00,880
You know...

3292
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:03,820
For you guys to...

3293
02:11:03,820 --> 02:11:04,740
Um...

3294
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:06,080
Also...

3295
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:07,600
Receive, you know...

3296
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:09,200
In whatever ways that I can give.

3297
02:11:09,680 --> 02:11:11,460
I feel like... I'm just like...

3298
02:11:11,460 --> 02:11:15,440
How... How is merch any special because you're just spending money?

3299
02:11:17,580 --> 02:11:19,620
But I... um...

3300
02:11:22,990 --> 02:11:24,610
I just wish I could...

3301
02:11:25,370 --> 02:11:27,090
Give you guys... uh...

3302
02:11:28,350 --> 02:11:30,010
Give you guys back... like...

3303
02:11:30,010 --> 02:11:31,870
Fifty-fold!

3304
02:11:32,830 --> 02:11:34,470
Everything that, um...

3305
02:11:35,570 --> 02:11:41,330
You have done for me, so...

3306
02:11:47,940 --> 02:11:48,780
Get

3307
02:11:52,260 --> 02:11:53,640
that BBL!

3308
02:11:56,100 --> 02:11:58,400
And so, even if, uh...

3309
02:11:59,660 --> 02:12:01,080
Even, um...

3310
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:05,800
My birthday...

3311
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:07,140
Or sincere feelings...

3312
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:10,240
Um...

3313
02:12:10,240 --> 02:12:11,280
Yeah, you do.

3314
02:12:11,720 --> 02:12:12,280
Yeah...

3315
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:14,660
Yeah, I wanna watch you cry...

3316
02:12:16,200 --> 02:12:17,820
Before I start streaming.

3317
02:12:19,940 --> 02:12:21,600
But yeah... so...

3318
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:23,160
Um...

3319
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:27,040
Never got to appreciate our time in the past.

3320
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:28,300
I'm glad to have another chance!

3321
02:12:28,680 --> 02:12:29,220
Thank you!

3322
02:12:29,820 --> 02:12:32,640
We have to pay you back tenfold, 500 fold!

3323
02:12:32,740 --> 02:12:33,860
What are you talking about?

3324
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:36,680
What are you talking about?

3325
02:12:48,750 --> 02:12:50,430
I always... sorry.

3326
02:12:51,690 --> 02:12:54,750
I always feel bad because I just feel like...

3327
02:12:55,150 --> 02:12:57,410
You guys do so much for me and I...

3328
02:12:57,410 --> 02:12:58,730
Can't ever...

3329
02:12:59,390 --> 02:13:01,970
I can't ever repay it...

3330
02:13:01,970 --> 02:13:02,970
Like well enough.

3331
02:13:04,950 --> 02:13:06,230
I just...

3332
02:13:12,860 --> 02:13:15,200
So that's why I'm always just like, I'm sorry.

3333
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:18,600
Because I just really...

3334
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:20,380
I'm really so thankful.

3335
02:13:20,580 --> 02:13:23,220
I'm really so grateful for...

3336
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:24,960
You know...

3337
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:26,900
Being in this position.

3338
02:13:27,460 --> 02:13:27,880
And...

3339
02:13:30,060 --> 02:13:31,880
Like I feel like I'm just...

3340
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:33,680
I'm just the luckiest...

3341
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:35,900
I'm the luckiest ghost ever.

3342
02:13:36,100 --> 02:13:36,840
To ever exist.

3343
02:13:37,120 --> 02:13:38,140
Ever to exist.

3344
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:39,520
So...

3345
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:41,940
Sorry I'm such a crybaby today.

3346
02:13:54,070 --> 02:13:56,090
Like I said, it's been kind of a year.

3347
02:13:57,310 --> 02:13:58,270
And so...

3348
02:14:02,790 --> 02:14:03,550
It's been...

3349
02:14:03,550 --> 02:14:04,510
It's been a year.

3350
02:14:06,250 --> 02:14:06,730
And...

3351
02:14:08,470 --> 02:14:11,070
Even when I'm a little lonely, you guys...

3352
02:14:11,810 --> 02:14:12,290
Never...

3353
02:14:13,050 --> 02:14:15,110
Make me feel lonely, so...

3354
02:14:17,050 --> 02:14:18,670
Just kind of like...

3355
02:14:20,590 --> 02:14:22,330
Sometimes you're allowed to be a big sap.

3356
02:14:24,250 --> 02:14:24,770
What...

3357
02:14:24,770 --> 02:14:25,650
What...

3358
02:14:25,650 --> 02:14:26,630
I'm a leaf!

3359
02:14:26,850 --> 02:14:27,830
Mint is a leaf!

3360
02:14:27,890 --> 02:14:28,770
Mint is not a tree!

3361
02:14:35,730 --> 02:14:36,770
Sap hours...

3362
02:14:38,350 --> 02:14:39,930
I'm not really good at...

3363
02:14:41,810 --> 02:14:42,330
I...

3364
02:14:43,630 --> 02:14:44,150
I...

3365
02:14:44,150 --> 02:14:45,650
Expressing myself sometimes.

3366
02:14:45,830 --> 02:14:47,170
Especially because when I do...

3367
02:14:47,170 --> 02:14:49,150
I turn into the puddle like this.

3368
02:14:49,550 --> 02:14:53,370
You can repay us by getting an oil rig and starting a PMC!

3369
02:14:53,970 --> 02:14:54,490
Yeah!

3370
02:14:58,550 --> 02:14:59,070
Yeah!

3371
02:15:01,950 --> 02:15:03,330
We'll start a PMC.

3372
02:15:09,730 --> 02:15:12,070
I'm not a words guy, but you're a pretty cool ghost.

3373
02:15:12,290 --> 02:15:13,150
Oh, I'm a cool ghost.

3374
02:15:15,610 --> 02:15:17,170
We're diamond wisps.

3375
02:15:22,750 --> 02:15:25,150
You guys are always...

3376
02:15:27,470 --> 02:15:30,490
I think you guys make me laugh more than...

3377
02:15:30,490 --> 02:15:32,030
I make you guys laugh.

3378
02:15:34,310 --> 02:15:35,670
Private Minto Company.

3379
02:15:35,990 --> 02:15:36,470
Yeah!

3380
02:15:40,950 --> 02:15:41,930
Mint boss.

3381
02:15:43,410 --> 02:15:44,770
Private maid company!

3382
02:15:46,150 --> 02:15:46,630
Perfect!

3383
02:15:47,790 --> 02:15:49,010
Wait, what does this...

3384
02:15:49,010 --> 02:15:49,710
What does the...

3385
02:15:49,710 --> 02:15:49,990
Oh, wait.

3386
02:15:50,030 --> 02:15:52,270
It's usually private military company, right?

3387
02:15:56,980 --> 02:15:58,260
Honor to serve you, boss.

3388
02:15:58,560 --> 02:15:59,040
No!

3389
02:15:59,120 --> 02:16:00,000
I'm the maid!

3390
02:16:00,120 --> 02:16:01,060
I'm serving you!

3391
02:16:02,780 --> 02:16:03,660
Oh, contractor.

3392
02:16:04,180 --> 02:16:04,660
Contractor.

3393
02:16:04,660 --> 02:16:04,920
That's right.

3394
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:05,260
Yeah, yeah.

3395
02:16:07,620 --> 02:16:09,180
Thank you, Kuya.

3396
02:16:09,860 --> 02:16:11,560
Thank you guys for all the super chats.

3397
02:16:11,680 --> 02:16:12,640
Thank you so much.

3398
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:14,820
Pervert maid company.

3399
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:15,240
Get out.

3400
02:16:15,320 --> 02:16:15,920
You know what?

3401
02:16:15,940 --> 02:16:16,300
Never mind.

3402
02:16:16,360 --> 02:16:16,820
I'll take it back.

3403
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:22,340
But life's a little boring if you're not a pervert.

3404
02:16:22,420 --> 02:16:23,000
Isn't it true?

3405
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:25,800
You gotta be a little perverted.

3406
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:29,020
I think life is more fun that way.

3407
02:16:37,830 --> 02:16:39,050
So true, ghost.

3408
02:16:39,270 --> 02:16:42,250
Do not scatter our ectoplasm to the heartless sea.

3409
02:16:42,370 --> 02:16:42,590
No.

3410
02:16:43,130 --> 02:16:43,930
I'll eat it.

3411
02:16:46,110 --> 02:16:53,410
The fact that you're here with us celebrating now is better than any merch money goodbye.

3412
02:16:54,670 --> 02:16:58,190
But if you want to grab something, a reminder that Virtual Vacation merch is now available online.

3413
02:17:01,790 --> 02:17:02,890
It's true, actually.

3414
02:17:04,090 --> 02:17:05,710
If you didn't go to...

3415
02:17:07,570 --> 02:17:11,730
If you didn't go to Virtual Vacation, if you want the...

3416
02:17:11,730 --> 02:17:12,610
Oh my god, stop.

3417
02:17:12,610 --> 02:17:13,450
Stop, Luhun!

3418
02:17:14,850 --> 02:17:15,330
Stop!

3419
02:17:17,650 --> 02:17:19,570
Oh my gosh, thanks for the rainbow!

3420
02:17:22,830 --> 02:17:23,870
Oh my god.

3421
02:17:26,090 --> 02:17:27,290
I have the...

3422
02:17:28,330 --> 02:17:31,090
Luhun made some little keychains, right?

3423
02:17:31,170 --> 02:17:32,170
Some mint keychains.

3424
02:17:32,210 --> 02:17:33,610
And I still have the form.

3425
02:17:33,970 --> 02:17:36,130
I still have the model thing that you gave me.

3426
02:17:36,230 --> 02:17:39,110
And I'm like, how can I create my own mint army?

3427
02:17:41,610 --> 02:17:42,130
Mintification.

3428
02:17:43,750 --> 02:17:45,390
My little tiny mint army.

3429
02:17:48,030 --> 02:17:49,470
You always make my day, boss.

3430
02:17:50,110 --> 02:17:50,630
Thanks.

3431
02:17:51,630 --> 02:17:52,350
Thank you.

3432
02:17:52,470 --> 02:17:54,310
You guys always make my day too.

3433
02:17:54,830 --> 02:17:55,790
I mean that.

3434
02:17:59,080 --> 02:17:59,600
Yeah.

3435
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:01,460
I mean that.

3436
02:18:04,760 --> 02:18:06,580
Which is why I always...

3437
02:18:06,580 --> 02:18:07,460
You know.

3438
02:18:10,480 --> 02:18:12,600
I want you to be so happy.

3439
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:13,920
So healthy.

3440
02:18:14,560 --> 02:18:16,480
And I want you guys to have fun.

3441
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:17,840
And if...

3442
02:18:21,890 --> 02:18:23,890
If your days are bad...

3443
02:18:24,410 --> 02:18:25,090
You know.

3444
02:18:25,170 --> 02:18:27,790
You can always come to Minto's dream.

3445
02:18:28,650 --> 02:18:29,770
And have a good time.

3446
02:18:29,870 --> 02:18:30,210
I hope.

3447
02:18:31,870 --> 02:18:32,610
I hope.

3448
02:18:32,970 --> 02:18:36,030
If I can at least make you laugh just a little bit.

3449
02:18:38,410 --> 02:18:38,870
But...

3450
02:18:39,570 --> 02:18:40,890
She doesn't hate us.

3451
02:18:40,950 --> 02:18:41,230
Real.

3452
02:18:43,890 --> 02:18:44,790
Always remember.

3453
02:18:45,210 --> 02:18:45,670
Wait.

3454
02:18:45,730 --> 02:18:47,110
Always remember.

3455
02:18:48,010 --> 02:18:49,210
Happy Minto Day.

3456
02:18:54,990 --> 02:18:55,450
But...

3457
02:18:57,210 --> 02:18:58,270
I suck at words.

3458
02:18:58,290 --> 02:18:59,650
But I think you are pretty good.

3459
02:19:00,910 --> 02:19:02,690
Those are the best words I could hear.

3460
02:19:04,450 --> 02:19:05,930
Those are the best words I could hear.

3461
02:19:06,030 --> 02:19:07,210
You are pretty good.

3462
02:19:07,410 --> 02:19:07,690
Oh my god.

3463
02:19:07,730 --> 02:19:08,770
What is this one now?

3464
02:19:08,970 --> 02:19:09,730
What is this one?

3465
02:19:10,470 --> 02:19:11,570
Here is a sign of my affection.

3466
02:19:11,770 --> 02:19:13,450
Outer Wilds meant a lot to me.

3467
02:19:13,530 --> 02:19:14,450
It means a lot to you too.

3468
02:19:14,530 --> 02:19:15,030
So for chat.

3469
02:19:24,420 --> 02:19:25,920
Outer Wilds means so much to me.

3470
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:27,240
Yeah.

3471
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:34,620
Sometimes chat is my oshi.

3472
02:19:34,740 --> 02:19:36,940
And I like to give every super chat a like after reading.

3473
02:19:37,080 --> 02:19:37,980
That's so wholesome.

3474
02:19:38,680 --> 02:19:39,800
I give that a like.

3475
02:19:42,160 --> 02:19:43,620
It won't let me like it normally.

3476
02:19:43,720 --> 02:19:44,740
But it will let me heart it.

3477
02:19:48,460 --> 02:19:50,520
I do have some giveaways as well.

3478
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:51,820
But...

3479
02:19:51,820 --> 02:19:53,360
I'm not sure how to give them away.

3480
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:56,080
So you guys might know.

3481
02:19:56,260 --> 02:19:57,320
That I have a code.

3482
02:19:57,400 --> 02:19:58,620
With gamersubs.

3483
02:20:00,580 --> 02:20:01,020
But...

3484
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:02,960
Today...

3485
02:20:03,540 --> 02:20:05,380
They asked if I wanted some codes.

3486
02:20:05,620 --> 02:20:06,120
Oh my gosh.

3487
02:20:07,160 --> 02:20:08,320
Thank you for the...

3488
02:20:12,660 --> 02:20:14,680
They said if I wanted some codes.

3489
02:20:15,060 --> 02:20:16,080
And basically...

3490
02:20:16,080 --> 02:20:17,560
They gave me...

3491
02:20:17,560 --> 02:20:18,800
They gave me...

3492
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:19,260
Hold on.

3493
02:20:19,860 --> 02:20:20,380
Um...

3494
02:20:21,740 --> 02:20:22,260
Uh...

3495
02:20:22,260 --> 02:20:23,300
Uh...

3496
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:25,840
I thought it was gonna be like...

3497
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:27,240
Oh, here's a code for...

3498
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:29,580
40% off.

3499
02:20:29,900 --> 02:20:30,440
No, no.

3500
02:20:30,620 --> 02:20:32,240
They gave me some crazy codes.

3501
02:20:33,440 --> 02:20:35,540
I just don't know how to get rid of them.

3502
02:20:35,540 --> 02:20:36,560
They gave me...

3503
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:39,240
5 codes for $40.

3504
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:42,400
3 codes for $60.

3505
02:20:42,720 --> 02:20:45,540
And 1 code for $100 off.

3506
02:20:45,900 --> 02:20:48,020
And none of the codes expire.

3507
02:20:48,660 --> 02:20:49,040
And none of the codes expire.

3508
02:20:49,320 --> 02:20:49,940
And none of the codes expire.

3509
02:20:49,960 --> 02:20:50,400
Yeah.

3510
02:20:51,160 --> 02:20:51,820
So...

3511
02:20:53,460 --> 02:20:55,760
How do you do giveaways on YouTube?

3512
02:20:56,040 --> 02:20:56,920
I don't know!

3513
02:21:00,300 --> 02:21:00,960
So...

3514
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:03,680
They actually gave some pretty awesome stuff.

3515
02:21:03,980 --> 02:21:04,680
That's crazy.

3516
02:21:04,900 --> 02:21:05,420
I know, right?

3517
02:21:05,540 --> 02:21:06,340
So...

3518
02:21:06,340 --> 02:21:08,360
Big shoutouts to Via.

3519
02:21:08,580 --> 02:21:09,400
Thank you.

3520
02:21:09,540 --> 02:21:10,840
And Gabersupps.

3521
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:13,340
Thank you so much for providing these codes.

3522
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:14,480
I was so shocked.

3523
02:21:14,500 --> 02:21:15,120
I was like...

3524
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:17,040
I thought it was just gonna be like...

3525
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:19,440
Buy code but different.

3526
02:21:19,720 --> 02:21:22,200
But no, they gave like real code codes.

3527
02:21:22,500 --> 02:21:22,920
So...

3528
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:24,600
Maybe...

3529
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:29,220
What I will do is probably create a Google form.

3530
02:21:29,360 --> 02:21:30,700
And you can sign up.

3531
02:21:30,700 --> 02:21:32,640
Because obviously I'm going to need like...

3532
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:34,200
Some contact email or something.

3533
02:21:34,340 --> 02:21:35,640
For me to send you the...

3534
02:21:37,220 --> 02:21:38,000
The codes.

3535
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:39,380
And I will do...

3536
02:21:39,380 --> 02:21:41,800
I will pick somebody at random.

3537
02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:44,720
And for each one...

3538
02:21:46,100 --> 02:21:46,540
Um...

3539
02:21:47,440 --> 02:21:48,800
The Hunger Games.

3540
02:21:51,220 --> 02:21:51,660
Yeah.

3541
02:21:52,540 --> 02:21:52,980
So...

3542
02:21:52,980 --> 02:21:53,980
I don't know.

3543
02:21:54,020 --> 02:21:55,080
Do you guys want me to do it now?

3544
02:21:55,180 --> 02:21:56,420
Or do you want me to...

3545
02:21:56,420 --> 02:21:58,100
Maybe I'll do it...

3546
02:21:58,100 --> 02:21:59,620
Maybe next stream or something.

3547
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:01,280
I can have the...

3548
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:04,100
The form be up for a certain amount of time.

3549
02:22:04,280 --> 02:22:06,220
Because I would want VOD watchers...

3550
02:22:06,220 --> 02:22:08,240
To have an opportunity as well.

3551
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:10,560
So I'll have the form up.

3552
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:11,900
And um...

3553
02:22:13,520 --> 02:22:15,120
Take your time to get it set up.

3554
02:22:15,180 --> 02:22:15,680
Thank you.

3555
02:22:17,220 --> 02:22:18,140
After stream.

3556
02:22:18,340 --> 02:22:18,540
Yeah.

3557
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:20,580
Because maybe some people are listening to the stream.

3558
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:24,180
And they won't have a chance to enter or anything like that.

3559
02:22:24,580 --> 02:22:25,040
So...

3560
02:22:26,420 --> 02:22:28,060
I shouldn't be laughing so hard.

3561
02:22:28,380 --> 02:22:29,720
Magic doodoo chance.

3562
02:22:40,060 --> 02:22:40,980
But um...

3563
02:22:43,700 --> 02:22:45,160
VODs deserve a chance.

3564
02:22:45,300 --> 02:22:45,760
Of course.

3565
02:22:45,900 --> 02:22:47,500
Make an announcement also on Twitter.

3566
02:22:47,560 --> 02:22:48,120
I will.

3567
02:22:48,760 --> 02:22:49,020
I will.

3568
02:22:49,120 --> 02:22:49,280
I will.

3569
02:22:49,400 --> 02:22:50,400
I'll post it everywhere.

3570
02:22:50,820 --> 02:22:52,720
So everybody...

3571
02:22:52,720 --> 02:22:53,700
Gotta go now.

3572
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:54,180
Thanks 9!

3573
02:22:59,800 --> 02:23:00,320
1 year.

3574
02:23:02,140 --> 02:23:02,740
Because...

3575
02:23:02,740 --> 02:23:04,240
I graduated.

3576
02:23:05,380 --> 02:23:06,480
On 4-4.

3577
02:23:06,640 --> 02:23:07,420
April 4th.

3578
02:23:07,420 --> 02:23:09,120
And then I returned on April 4th.

3579
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:10,020
So it's been 1...

3580
02:23:10,840 --> 02:23:12,240
Non-consecutive year.

3581
02:23:13,660 --> 02:23:14,860
But overall...

3582
02:23:16,020 --> 02:23:17,040
4 years.

3583
02:23:18,860 --> 02:23:19,800
4 years.

3584
02:23:20,620 --> 02:23:21,580
It's not about...

3585
02:23:21,580 --> 02:23:22,260
Changing the world.

3586
02:23:22,340 --> 02:23:22,800
It's about...

3587
02:23:22,800 --> 02:23:25,540
Doing our best to make our world a bit better.

3588
02:23:27,100 --> 02:23:27,700
Hmm...

3589
02:23:28,340 --> 02:23:28,940
Yeah.

3590
02:23:29,800 --> 02:23:31,500
Respecting the will of others and believing in your own.

3591
02:23:31,620 --> 02:23:32,560
There's only one mint.

3592
02:23:33,220 --> 02:23:35,040
But there's room for a lot of wisps.

3593
02:23:37,440 --> 02:23:38,140
Thanks boss.

3594
02:23:39,540 --> 02:23:40,740
What if instead...

3595
02:23:41,420 --> 02:23:43,620
Of the hunger games, it was the freaky games.

3596
02:23:43,880 --> 02:23:44,480
Oh my gosh.

3597
02:23:44,500 --> 02:23:46,060
What if we all got into...

3598
02:23:46,060 --> 02:23:47,420
Got into Minecraft...

3599
02:23:47,420 --> 02:23:50,380
And it was just PvP and last one standing won.

3600
02:23:51,380 --> 02:23:52,080
Oh my gosh.

3601
02:23:52,120 --> 02:23:53,760
What if we crab-gamed it?

3602
02:23:55,160 --> 02:23:56,080
What if we...

3603
02:23:56,080 --> 02:23:58,400
What if we fall-guys-tortmented?

3604
02:24:03,780 --> 02:24:05,600
PvP pervert versus pervert?

3605
02:24:06,380 --> 02:24:06,980
Yeah.

3606
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:08,760
Yes.

3607
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:10,420
Marble game.

3608
02:24:16,400 --> 02:24:19,080
There will be blood!

3609
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:19,920
Blood!

3610
02:24:20,200 --> 02:24:20,960
Shed!

3611
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:21,660
Shed!

3612
02:24:22,080 --> 02:24:23,520
Just for a code.

3613
02:24:23,620 --> 02:24:24,060
Hell yeah.

3614
02:24:26,320 --> 02:24:27,760
Freaky fall-guys.

3615
02:24:29,260 --> 02:24:30,980
May the biggest pervert win!

3616
02:24:38,780 --> 02:24:39,980
But yeah.

3617
02:24:40,100 --> 02:24:41,160
Thank you guys for...

3618
02:24:41,160 --> 02:24:41,640
You know...

3619
02:24:44,140 --> 02:24:46,500
Mint may never fulfill all of my wishes.

3620
02:24:47,180 --> 02:24:47,500
Mint may never fulfill all of my wishes.

3621
02:24:48,020 --> 02:24:48,620
Yeah.

3622
02:24:48,740 --> 02:24:50,080
Maybe that's for the best, right?

3623
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:52,760
Yeah.

3624
02:24:52,760 --> 02:24:53,360
Maybe that's for the best, right?

3625
02:24:53,360 --> 02:24:54,140
Thank you guys...

3626
02:24:55,740 --> 02:24:57,400
So much for...

3627
02:24:57,400 --> 02:24:59,560
Sorry, I start getting emotional again.

3628
02:25:04,020 --> 02:25:04,580
For...

3629
02:25:05,140 --> 02:25:06,320
For supporting...

3630
02:25:06,320 --> 02:25:08,060
A little ghost like me.

3631
02:25:10,040 --> 02:25:10,600
And...

3632
02:25:12,640 --> 02:25:14,620
Should go with B after all.

3633
02:25:16,640 --> 02:25:19,000
Thanks for accepting me when I'm a little freaky.

3634
02:25:20,260 --> 02:25:21,440
When I'm a little shy.

3635
02:25:22,020 --> 02:25:23,220
When I'm a little...

3636
02:25:23,220 --> 02:25:25,080
When I'm a little ghastly.

3637
02:25:25,400 --> 02:25:25,960
Ghostly.

3638
02:25:30,300 --> 02:25:32,120
A little freaky.

3639
02:25:34,220 --> 02:25:36,580
A little freaky.

3640
02:25:36,580 --> 02:25:37,080
Yeah.

3641
02:25:40,300 --> 02:25:41,760
I hope you guys...

3642
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:42,380
I hope you guys...

3643
02:25:42,380 --> 02:25:44,080
Enjoy the rest of your night.

3644
02:25:44,300 --> 02:25:46,320
I thought about maybe going into VRChat.

3645
02:25:46,680 --> 02:25:46,900
I thought about maybe going into VRChat.

3646
02:25:48,380 --> 02:25:50,400
But I think I gotta go eat instead.

3647
02:25:53,460 --> 02:25:54,580
Words hard.

3648
02:25:54,580 --> 02:25:55,380
Mint good.

3649
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:56,140
Big heart.

3650
02:25:56,240 --> 02:25:56,720
Love forever.

3651
02:25:56,940 --> 02:25:57,660
Real freak too.

3652
02:26:02,820 --> 02:26:05,000
And all the donations as well.

3653
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:06,560
I know they've been kind of backed up.

3654
02:26:06,660 --> 02:26:07,500
From the...

3655
02:26:08,400 --> 02:26:10,500
From all the gifted memberships.

3656
02:26:10,860 --> 02:26:12,920
I just saw a Snee that you said...

3657
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:13,740
There's a kudo board!

3658
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:14,800
Wait.

3659
02:26:14,920 --> 02:26:16,280
My anniversary tag!

3660
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:19,220
Oh my gosh.

3661
02:26:19,240 --> 02:26:19,880
I think the...

3662
02:26:19,880 --> 02:26:21,600
The viewer count just stabilized.

3663
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:22,400
Oh my god.

3664
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:24,460
I think it's just stable.

3665
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:32,840
Where is...

3666
02:26:32,840 --> 02:26:32,960
Oh.

3667
02:26:33,060 --> 02:26:34,200
I was like where is it?

3668
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:36,340
It's here.

3669
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:38,400
Hashtag mintiversary.

3670
02:26:38,900 --> 02:26:39,320
Wait.

3671
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:39,880
Where do I...

3672
02:26:39,880 --> 02:26:41,200
Kudo board.

3673
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:43,420
Kudo board.

3674
02:26:43,420 --> 02:26:43,500
Kudo board.

3675
02:26:50,970 --> 02:26:51,410
Oh!

3676
02:26:51,410 --> 02:26:52,250
I see it!

3677
02:26:52,710 --> 02:26:53,410
Thank you!

3678
02:26:55,270 --> 02:26:56,130
Maybe I'll...

3679
02:26:56,130 --> 02:26:59,310
Look after stream in case people are still...

3680
02:26:59,310 --> 02:26:59,650
I don't know.

3681
02:26:59,690 --> 02:27:00,970
Can people still add it to that?

3682
02:27:01,150 --> 02:27:02,150
All the bots are gone.

3683
02:27:07,210 --> 02:27:08,570
YouTube's been really weird lately.

3684
02:27:08,790 --> 02:27:10,150
Thanks for giving me so many laughs.

3685
02:27:10,270 --> 02:27:11,170
Thank you so much!

3686
02:27:11,270 --> 02:27:11,910
Thank you.

3687
02:27:12,190 --> 02:27:12,690
Thank you.

3688
02:27:12,770 --> 02:27:12,970
Thank you.

3689
02:27:15,070 --> 02:27:15,510
Vengeance.

3690
02:27:17,350 --> 02:27:18,870
Get your games everybody.

3691
02:27:19,230 --> 02:27:20,230
But if you have the games.

3692
02:27:20,390 --> 02:27:21,610
Don't take them from other people.

3693
02:27:22,490 --> 02:27:24,310
Trying to see if I can find my first chat.

3694
02:27:24,550 --> 02:27:26,570
Ace Attorney vids were my favorite back in the day.

3695
02:27:28,210 --> 02:27:30,750
I don't have any plans on...

3696
02:27:30,750 --> 02:27:32,290
Un-privating the old VODs.

3697
02:27:32,290 --> 02:27:35,290
Because I'm still kind of embarrassed by everything with that.

3698
02:27:36,470 --> 02:27:36,990
But...

3699
02:27:36,990 --> 02:27:37,990
I...

3700
02:27:37,990 --> 02:27:38,790
And also...

3701
02:27:38,790 --> 02:27:43,370
I want to make memories with...

3702
02:27:44,530 --> 02:27:45,050
With...

3703
02:27:45,070 --> 02:27:47,010
With old fans, new fans...

3704
02:27:47,010 --> 02:27:48,790
Maybe if you...

3705
02:27:48,790 --> 02:27:50,850
Somehow if I haunted you...

3706
02:27:50,850 --> 02:27:52,070
Somehow in between...

3707
02:27:52,070 --> 02:27:54,410
When I left and when I came back...

3708
02:27:55,150 --> 02:27:56,550
I would like to make...

3709
02:27:56,550 --> 02:27:57,590
All sorts of memories.

3710
02:27:57,990 --> 02:28:00,510
With everybody and...

3711
02:28:00,510 --> 02:28:02,430
Have lots of things...

3712
02:28:02,770 --> 02:28:04,430
Lots of new memories.

3713
02:28:07,070 --> 02:28:07,750
So...

3714
02:28:07,750 --> 02:28:10,050
I'm not like...

3715
02:28:11,610 --> 02:28:12,710
Abandoning it...

3716
02:28:12,710 --> 02:28:13,990
Not saying...

3717
02:28:13,990 --> 02:28:15,570
Not saying it never happened.

3718
02:28:15,970 --> 02:28:17,390
Just kind of moving forward.

3719
02:28:18,390 --> 02:28:18,870
And...

3720
02:28:27,950 --> 02:28:29,330
I'll be there no matter what.

3721
02:28:29,890 --> 02:28:30,510
Thank you!

3722
02:28:34,670 --> 02:28:36,830
Not even un-privating the debut stream.

3723
02:28:36,890 --> 02:28:38,450
I don't think we need the debut stream.

3724
02:28:38,610 --> 02:28:39,210
I think we...

3725
02:28:39,210 --> 02:28:42,450
I think you saw pretty much everything that was the debut stream.

3726
02:28:45,570 --> 02:28:46,050
Taco!

3727
02:28:46,390 --> 02:28:47,670
Thanks for the 50 gifted!

3728
02:28:47,670 --> 02:28:49,130
Thank you guys so much for all the gifted!

3729
02:28:49,270 --> 02:28:50,410
If I missed you, I'm so sorry!

3730
02:28:50,990 --> 02:28:51,590
Thank you!

3731
02:28:51,630 --> 02:28:54,270
I'm reading them as fast as they scroll by.

3732
02:28:55,550 --> 02:28:57,310
I'm reading them as fast as they scroll by.

3733
02:29:00,570 --> 02:29:01,010
I'm reading them as fast as they scroll by.

3734
02:29:01,010 --> 02:29:01,990
Free the debut stream.

3735
02:29:02,170 --> 02:29:04,550
Maybe I will free the intro video.

3736
02:29:04,850 --> 02:29:05,190
Maybe.

3737
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:06,930
Plus pre-ordered.

3738
02:29:08,290 --> 02:29:09,050
Thank you!

3739
02:29:12,790 --> 02:29:14,650
I feel like I want to say more.

3740
02:29:14,790 --> 02:29:16,090
Maybe I should have written it down.

3741
02:29:16,350 --> 02:29:16,450
Maybe I should have written it down.

3742
02:29:17,670 --> 02:29:18,650
But um...

3743
02:29:21,730 --> 02:29:23,250
I have...

3744
02:29:23,250 --> 02:29:26,410
too many feelings in my kokoro.

3745
02:29:26,910 --> 02:29:28,250
In my heart.

3746
02:29:28,430 --> 02:29:31,430
Maybe it's better because I would just cry if I read everything.

3747
02:29:33,030 --> 02:29:34,370
Maybe it's better because I would just cry if I read everything.

3748
02:29:39,740 --> 02:29:41,640
So here's to...

3749
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:42,840
hopefully...

3750
02:29:43,320 --> 02:29:44,320
many more years?

3751
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:46,360
Hopefully?

3752
02:29:48,580 --> 02:29:49,340
And...

3753
02:29:50,220 --> 02:29:50,980
Um...

3754
02:29:51,360 --> 02:29:52,280
I'll keep...

3755
02:29:52,280 --> 02:29:53,720
I'll keep doing my best!

3756
02:29:56,100 --> 02:29:56,640
Yeah!

3757
02:29:56,820 --> 02:29:58,380
I can't believe also it's been...

3758
02:29:58,380 --> 02:30:00,120
I can't believe even that it's been...

3759
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:02,440
That it's been...

3760
02:30:03,160 --> 02:30:04,240
4 years.

3761
02:30:04,540 --> 02:30:05,880
It's insane to me.

3762
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:09,260
It's so crazy to me.

3763
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:13,320
That thing.

3764
02:30:13,940 --> 02:30:14,340
Oh...

3765
02:30:17,300 --> 02:30:17,700
Hmm...

3766
02:30:18,940 --> 02:30:22,780
Recently started watching and following you, I look forward to your streams or podcasts, Whatever I can make it.

3767
02:30:23,020 --> 02:30:23,660
Thank you!

3768
02:30:23,900 --> 02:30:25,040
Thanks for finding me.

3769
02:30:26,060 --> 02:30:27,020
Thank you, thank you!

3770
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:30,320
I gotta find that video.

3771
02:30:30,500 --> 02:30:31,240
I gotta show you guys.

3772
02:30:32,060 --> 02:30:34,100
That's one thing from the past we can show.

3773
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:50,400
Thank you!

3774
02:30:50,920 --> 02:30:58,980
Thank you!

3775
02:31:04,100 --> 02:31:14,600
The anime... the anime fest that I'll be at tomorrow, in Texas, that Ayami-sensei will have merch as well if you're going to be there.

3776
02:31:14,740 --> 02:31:16,460
It's exclusive to the event.

3777
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:20,020
Let me see.

3778
02:31:20,200 --> 02:31:20,720
Hold on.

3779
02:31:21,300 --> 02:31:21,700
Ayami...

3780
02:31:23,060 --> 02:31:24,440
She sent it to me earlier.

3781
02:31:24,800 --> 02:31:26,120
She sent it to me earlier.

3782
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:27,160
She was just like...

3783
02:31:27,160 --> 02:31:30,380
She was like, oh, I forgot to ask you sooner.

3784
02:31:30,500 --> 02:31:32,140
Is it okay if I make merch of us?

3785
02:31:32,300 --> 02:31:33,040
I was like, of course!

3786
02:31:34,100 --> 02:31:34,860
Let me see.

3787
02:31:34,980 --> 02:31:35,400
Hold on.

3788
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:37,340
Anime fest.

3789
02:31:38,120 --> 02:31:41,480
This will be at the Sekai Project booth, I believe.

3790
02:31:43,300 --> 02:31:45,840
Which will have all of her merch as well if you're going.

3791
02:31:46,140 --> 02:31:47,440
But look how cute this is.

3792
02:31:48,160 --> 02:31:49,280
Look how cute this is.

3793
02:31:49,380 --> 02:31:49,780
Look at this.

3794
02:31:49,880 --> 02:31:50,180
Look at this.

3795
02:31:50,360 --> 02:31:51,000
Oh, sorry.

3796
02:31:51,140 --> 02:31:52,160
My face went whack again.

3797
02:31:56,340 --> 02:31:57,140
Oh, sorry.

3798
02:31:57,320 --> 02:31:57,580
My bad.

3799
02:31:57,940 --> 02:31:58,480
There we go.

3800
02:31:58,580 --> 02:31:59,340
Look at this!

3801
02:32:00,320 --> 02:32:01,300
Look how cute!

3802
02:32:03,500 --> 02:32:05,640
There's a print and an acrylic keychain feature.

3803
02:32:06,340 --> 02:32:07,680
Ayami-sensei and me!

3804
02:32:09,080 --> 02:32:09,780
Oh my gosh.

3805
02:32:09,920 --> 02:32:12,200
It looks like a real ghost is haunting me right now.

3806
02:32:19,720 --> 02:32:21,260
How do I get rid of it?

3807
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:26,480
How?

3808
02:32:26,480 --> 02:32:26,960
How?

3809
02:32:27,720 --> 02:32:30,140
How do I change my face back to normal?

3810
02:32:34,420 --> 02:32:35,900
How do I change it back to normal?

3811
02:32:44,250 --> 02:32:45,110
I don't know.

3812
02:32:45,270 --> 02:32:46,330
I think I give up.

3813
02:32:48,190 --> 02:32:48,870
But anyway.

3814
02:32:49,090 --> 02:32:49,930
Isn't it so cute?

3815
02:32:50,670 --> 02:32:51,730
Isn't it so, so cute?

3816
02:32:53,670 --> 02:32:54,550
We're cowgirls!

3817
02:32:59,210 --> 02:32:59,990
They're so cute.

3818
02:33:00,070 --> 02:33:00,290
And look!

3819
02:33:00,390 --> 02:33:01,350
You guys are a cactus!

3820
02:33:04,290 --> 02:33:05,550
You guys are a cactus!

3821
02:33:07,990 --> 02:33:08,710
So cute.

3822
02:33:09,050 --> 02:33:10,170
So, so, so cute.

3823
02:33:10,830 --> 02:33:12,410
I think this is the first time...

3824
02:33:13,330 --> 02:33:15,590
Ayami-sensei has drawn me as like a merch.

3825
02:33:20,890 --> 02:33:24,570
So, if I see you tomorrow at Anime Fest, I'll see you tomorrow!

3826
02:33:25,910 --> 02:33:29,990
If not, then I'll see you at whatever event or I'll see you when I stream.

3827
02:33:35,920 --> 02:33:37,480
I'm gonna get rid of this background.

3828
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,080
Goodbye, background.

3829
02:33:40,860 --> 02:33:41,340
Goodbye.

3830
02:33:41,340 --> 02:33:41,500
Goodbye.

3831
02:33:43,380 --> 02:33:44,100
Uh...

3832
02:33:44,100 --> 02:33:45,300
Yeah.

3833
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,980
It's kinda surreal seeing Mint 1.0...

3834
02:33:49,980 --> 02:33:51,260
in this café.

3835
02:33:52,280 --> 02:33:53,000
ooooooooooooo

3836
02:33:57,180 --> 02:33:58,160
That's so creepy.

3837
02:34:00,100 --> 02:34:00,820
Okay.

3838
02:34:03,520 --> 02:34:04,240
Boston?

3839
02:34:06,560 --> 02:34:07,280
Boston.

3840
02:34:07,400 --> 02:34:07,720
Boston.

3841
02:34:07,960 --> 02:34:08,200
Boston.

3842
02:34:08,420 --> 02:34:08,580
Boston.

3843
02:34:08,940 --> 02:34:09,040
Boston.

3844
02:34:09,420 --> 02:34:10,380
B-B-Boston.

3845
02:34:10,480 --> 02:34:10,740
Boston.

3846
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:11,060
Bustin'.

3847
02:34:11,580 --> 02:34:12,960
B-b-b-b-b-bustin'!

3848
02:34:12,960 --> 02:34:15,660
B-b-b-bustin', bustin'!

3849
02:34:18,580 --> 02:34:18,980
Bustin'.

3850
02:34:21,960 --> 02:34:22,840
Oh my god, loud.

3851
02:34:39,030 --> 02:34:41,090
If there's something strange...

3852
02:34:41,090 --> 02:34:42,570
sleeping in your bed.

3853
02:34:44,470 --> 02:34:45,730
How do I get rid of this face?

3854
02:34:45,730 --> 02:34:46,570
Let me tell you something.

3855
02:34:47,390 --> 02:34:49,510
If there's something weird...

3856
02:34:49,510 --> 02:34:51,010
sleeping in your bed.

3857
02:34:51,550 --> 02:34:52,010
Ow!

3858
02:34:52,290 --> 02:34:53,210
Let me tell you something.

3859
02:34:54,250 --> 02:34:55,790
Bustin' makes me feel...

3860
02:34:55,790 --> 02:34:55,870
Oh!

3861
02:34:56,170 --> 02:34:56,770
Yeah!

3862
02:35:00,570 --> 02:35:05,470
Bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin'.

3863
02:35:07,310 --> 02:35:08,230
Hold on.

3864
02:35:13,790 --> 02:35:14,140
Yeah!

3865
02:35:18,060 --> 02:35:18,460
Yeah!

3866
02:35:20,860 --> 02:35:22,900
If you're seeing things...

3867
02:35:22,900 --> 02:35:24,520
sleeping in your bed.

3868
02:35:27,620 --> 02:35:28,360
Yeah!

3869
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:28,800
Yeah!

3870
02:35:28,900 --> 02:35:29,360
Yeah!

3871
02:35:29,360 --> 02:35:29,720
Yeah!

3872
02:35:29,820 --> 02:35:31,380
An invisible man...

3873
02:35:31,750 --> 02:35:32,960
sleeping in your bed.

3874
02:35:33,400 --> 02:35:33,900
Ow!

3875
02:35:34,140 --> 02:35:35,260
Let me tell you something.

3876
02:35:35,880 --> 02:35:36,300
Ow!

3877
02:35:36,740 --> 02:35:37,480
Yeah!

3878
02:35:37,540 --> 02:35:38,020
Yeah!

3879
02:35:38,100 --> 02:35:38,420
Yeah!

3880
02:35:42,460 --> 02:35:46,040
Bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin'.

3881
02:35:46,040 --> 02:35:49,660
makes me feel good, feel good, feel good.

3882
02:35:49,660 --> 02:35:51,720
Yeah, I'll make a prettier graphic for...

3883
02:35:51,720 --> 02:35:53,040
once the stuff is, you know.

3884
02:35:53,580 --> 02:35:55,540
Make a prettier graphic...

3885
02:35:55,540 --> 02:35:57,420
eventually, you know.

3886
02:35:59,180 --> 02:36:03,060
Bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin'.

3887
02:36:03,060 --> 02:36:10,380
makes me feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good.

3888
02:36:14,490 --> 02:36:15,940
Freaky ghost maid!

3889
02:36:18,600 --> 02:36:20,160
Freaky ghost maid!

3890
02:36:22,300 --> 02:36:22,820
Freaky ghost man!

3891
02:36:22,820 --> 02:36:24,100
Freaky man, baby!

3892
02:36:26,960 --> 02:36:27,480
Ow!

3893
02:36:27,620 --> 02:36:28,020
Ow!

3894
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:28,460
Ow!

3895
02:36:30,140 --> 02:36:31,560
Let me sleep in your bed.

3896
02:36:36,990 --> 02:36:38,090
Let me tell you something.

3897
02:36:38,990 --> 02:36:40,890
Sleeping makes me feel good!

3898
02:36:45,070 --> 02:36:46,750
I ain't afraid of no sleep.

3899
02:36:47,210 --> 02:36:48,830
I ain't afraid of no bed.

3900
02:36:50,690 --> 02:36:50,790
Hahaha.

3901
02:36:53,630 --> 02:36:54,830
Uninvisible bamb.

3902
02:36:56,030 --> 02:36:58,050
Freaky ghost bamb.

3903
02:37:02,930 --> 02:37:03,670
I'm eating.

3904
02:37:05,530 --> 02:37:06,170
Fume.

3905
02:37:06,410 --> 02:37:07,930
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

3906
02:37:12,250 --> 02:37:14,430
Feel good, feel good.

3907
02:37:15,370 --> 02:37:17,250
Feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good.

3908
02:37:17,910 --> 02:37:19,590
Why am I eating fried rice?

3909
02:37:19,870 --> 02:37:20,310
