00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,570
Hello!

2
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,070
Welcome back!

3
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,290
Master!

4
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,430
Lady!

5
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,470
Hello!

6
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,110
Hello!

7
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:35,670
Hello!

8
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,990
Hello!

9
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,750
Hello!

10
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,970
Hello!

11
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:41,370
Hello!

12
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,970
Hello!

13
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:42,990
Hello!

14
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:42,990
Hello!

15
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:42,990
Grammy!

16
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,010
Hi!

17
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,110
Hello!

18
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,870
Hi!

19
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,690
Hello!

20
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:51,470
Hello!

21
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,830
Wow!

22
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,010
Wow!

23
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,590
Okay, security guy, sorry.

24
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,350
Welcome, everybody, to Fears to Fathom.

25
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,350
Um...

26
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,910
The... last episode?

27
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,250
Question mark?

28
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,190
Of this series?

29
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,390
I feel like he's not gonna make it the last one.

30
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,430
I feel like he has had such good reception with it.

31
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,930
And he even says still, if you have a story to share, send it to here.

32
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,190
I feel like he's gonna keep at it.

33
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,230
Oh my gosh, Jerry!

34
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:20,470
Jerry!

35
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,010
With a G!

36
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,710
Gary!

37
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,010
Jerry, thank you for the video!

38
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,710
Thank you!

39
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,910
Thank you so much!

40
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,210
So, so, so early.

41
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,350
So early in the stream.

42
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,730
We're like freaks to Fathom.

43
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,130
But I've played all the episodes before.

44
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,570
But it's kind of silly that this is...

45
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,210
The potential last one might be the first one on my list.

46
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:50,410
Because it's my channel.

47
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,750
But which was your favorite?

48
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,030
Let's see.

49
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,530
We had Home Alone.

50
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:01,960
Um...

51
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,840
Because I'm pretty sure he said it was only gonna be five games.

52
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,040
Or at least the dev or whatever.

53
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,380
Home Alone...

54
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,420
Was the one with the... Wait, or was that Carson House?

55
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,660
I don't remember Home Alone.

56
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:15,860
Maybe.

57
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,940
Was Carson House the one with the girlfriend, right?

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,020
Iron Bart... Iron Bart!

59
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,840
Ironbark lookout.

60
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:31,140
Wait, then... I'm getting the settings all confused because there's two about a house and then two about going outside.

61
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,480
Yeah, the Yandere one.

62
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,400
Yeah, Carson house was the Yandere one, right?

63
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,020
Oh, pizza delivery.

64
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,720
I don't remember.

65
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,380
Yeah, Carson house was... you were house-sitting for a neighbor and you were texting a girl.

66
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,080
Yes, yes, yes.

67
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,200
Ironbark was the one... was that the one with the cult?

68
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,620
I think.

69
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,760
Yeah, this is the one with the cult that is like leaving skellies at your door.

70
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,220
Now the first two I don't remember so well.

71
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,840
Maybe I should put them on my channel because I can't remember how they were.

72
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,820
Like the one with the lasagna.

73
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,740
I hope there are more.

74
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,720
It's been nice to have these virtual urban legends.

75
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,560
It's fun, right?

76
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,000
And they're great games.

77
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:32,540
There are games that can be done in one stream, which are always sometimes more difficult to do, more difficult to find than you'd imagine.

78
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,240
Just a game that's kind of one and done, you know?

79
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,420
Which are great for streamers sometimes.

80
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,300
So, we should send a story in?

81
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,700
But I think he wants like realistic ones, doesn't he?

82
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,520
Perhaps.

83
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,520
I think these are all allegedly real, right?

84
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,840
Unless we could embellish one.

85
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:08,280
One time... one time I was... I was playing with a friend and she lived in not such a great neighborhood.

86
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,120
She...

87
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,880
It was a little bit dangerous, but...

88
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,360
Not so dangerous that we couldn't go out and play, the two of us ourselves, right?

89
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
And we were just taking a walk.

90
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,680
And...

91
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,140
I...

92
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,600
I...

93
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,160
Remember we were just like hanging out like at the top of a hill.

94
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,560
And...

95
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,660
I...

96
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,820
Look over at one of the neighboring houses and I see a guy in the window staring at us.

97
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,980
And I'm just like...

98
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,160
That's weird.

99
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,120
But I thought maybe he was just kind of like...

100
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,240
What are these kids doing on my lawn?

101
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,360
We weren't on the lawn.

102
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
But we were just like...

103
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,920
Kind of hanging out in the street.

104
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,240
And then...

105
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,160
Like I look away.

106
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,600
And then when I look back...

107
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,480
He has...

108
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,280
A...

109
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,360
A...

110
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,740
A camera!

111
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,680
Like he's taking pictures of us!

112
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,640
With a camera!

113
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,040
And I look at my friend and I didn't want to tell her because she lives here.

114
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,680
I didn't want to freak her out.

115
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,700
So I was just like...

116
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,300
A friend!

117
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,220
Let's...

118
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,280
Race down the hill!

119
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,120
Last one there is rotten egg!

120
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,040
And so we like...

121
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,980
Raced down the hill...

122
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,320
I...

123
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,580
I still think about that.

124
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,460
I was like...

125
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:19,960
Freaky...

126
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,420
Freaky...

127
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:23,960
So...

128
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,300
Something like that...

129
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,380
We just embellish it?

130
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,080
Make a freaky story out of it, right?

131
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,140
Mmmmm.

132
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:35,780
Mmmmmm.

133
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,820
Was the last one there a rotten egg?

134
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,040
Yeah, that's why I've got a big ol' egg head.

135
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,920
But that's my episodic horror.

136
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,680
That's my Freaks to Phantom right there.

137
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,180
Freak, Phantom, and origin story.

138
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,320
That guy in the window?

139
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:00,860
Me.

140
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,400
But yeah, so...

141
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,940
We're here at the Woodbury Getaway.

142
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,560
The Woodbury Woodbury Getaway.

143
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,220
Yeah.

144
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,080
And I guess we're going on a getaway.

145
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,640
This looks nice though.

146
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,000
It actually kind of reminds me of a Phasmophobia home.

147
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,680
I've been haunted for five months now.

148
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,760
F2F Episode 6?

149
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,920
Spears to Fathom episodes are never like hauntings.

150
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,680
They're never like that.

151
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,620
They're always like a real... Wait!

152
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,820
Which one?

153
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,840
There was one, was it?

154
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,960
It must be the hitchhike.

155
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Where you go to the motel.

156
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,800
Right?

157
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,900
And then you're stuck in the closet and you have to...

158
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,640
You can't say anything.

159
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,180
Then I don't remember the Home Alone one.

160
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,980
I think Home Alone had the lasagna.

161
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

162
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,880
You guys remember.

163
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,840
You guys remember so well.

164
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,620
Another thing I wanted to bring up today... was today.

165
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:21,200
Was the last episode of the Minto Matara Summer Special Podcast.

166
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,960
So happy!

167
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,600
Last...

168
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,720
Summer Special Day?

169
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,520
I believe actually next week.

170
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,620
Hold on, let me check.

171
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,120
Last... day of summer.

172
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,240
I think next week is actually the last.

173
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:40,660
Oh no!

174
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,480
The 22nd!

175
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,600
22nd or 23rd.

176
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,540
Is the last day.

177
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,240
So technically the next episode... or rather we...

178
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,860
This is the last episode that would be in summer.

179
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,540
I did plan it well.

180
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,620
I did plan it exactly.

181
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

182
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,440
Where's the s'mores pictures?

183
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,340
Where are they?

184
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,620
I didn't get s'mores!

185
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,180
But I have a couple days.

186
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,580
Before summer's over.

187
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,980
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do.

188
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,400
Yeah, I really mathematized it.

189
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,540
But we have a bonus episode.

190
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,560
If you were not watching Matara's stream, I was on it earlier.

191
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,700
Just before this.

192
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,620
And I kind of... We have a bonus episode and I talked about it.

193
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,000
And our bonus episode is going to be...

194
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,740
Sorry, the music's a little loud.

195
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,420
Going to be an interview with...

196
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,420
With... with... with... with... with...

197
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,220
The famous... the famous... in Akihabara...

198
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,280
Mofuku-chan-sama!

199
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,160
Of Dear Stage!

200
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,020
So we got to go to Dear Stage.

201
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,500
And we got to...

202
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,660
We got to...

203
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,180
Film in there and interview...

204
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:55,720
Oh my gosh, hold on.

205
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,560
Let me show you guys a picture.

206
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,320
Oh my gosh.

207
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,200
It's...

208
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,800
Oh my gosh.

209
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,680
Oh, oh, oh, TikTok.

210
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,760
Hold on, I have a picture I want to show you guys.

211
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,360
Oh my gosh.

212
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,740
Hold on.

213
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,160
It's like...

214
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,440
It was kind of like my dream come true.

215
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,080
And I...

216
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,380
Did cry.

217
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,540
Not on the episode.

218
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,060
Not while recording.

219
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,360
But definitely...

220
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,760
While I was in there.

221
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,340
Because I was like...

222
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,340
You can't usually take like photos and stuff.

223
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:28,740
You know.

224
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,680
Inside.

225
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,960
So to be able to...

226
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,800
Even record and everything...

227
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,600
Was just crazy.

228
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,540
Look at this photo.

229
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:38,940
Hold on.

230
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,420
Uh...

231
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,180
This is like...

232
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,280
My dream place.

233
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,860
This is my favorite place ever.

234
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,200
Oh my gosh.

235
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,260
Look at this picture.

236
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:51,760
Hold on.

237
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,280
Hold on.

238
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,600
Ta-da!

239
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,160
You can see us.

240
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,100
You can see the little Momo.

241
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,380
And you can see me.

242
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,580
Oh my gosh.

243
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,160
Isn't it crazy?

244
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,240
Oh my gosh.

245
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,040
I never thought...

246
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,260
I would even be able to...

247
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,080
Touch this stage.

248
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,780
You can see even back here.

249
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,180
There's a little thing that says no photography.

250
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,660
But that didn't apply to us.

251
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,600
Yeah.

252
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,200
It's so awesome.

253
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,980
So hopefully...

254
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,700
You watch that when that comes out.

255
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,700
Because it was super duper important.

256
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,140
To me.

257
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,240
Basically...

258
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,500
Mataro went to V-Shojo JP staff.

259
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,100
And was just like we want to do this thing.

260
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,120
Can you please help us make it work?

261
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,540
So they did.

262
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,420
And it was really awesome.

263
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,100
Yeah.

264
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,380
Guess you're a criminal now.

265
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,500
Always have been.

266
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,620
Will it be on the podcast channel?

267
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:50,920
Yeah.

268
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,740
Will it be on the podcast...

269
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,780
channel?

270
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,180
So...

271
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,020
Yippee!

272
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,560
I'll post a photo later.

273
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,120
I have more photos too.

274
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,580
I was so like...

275
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,140
Oh my god.

276
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,480
Oh my god.

277
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,360
I was so excited.

278
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,620
You guys ready?

279
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,480
To experience a fears to fathoms.

280
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,540
The fears to freakdoms.

281
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,120
Next week or sometime later.

282
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,340
Depends on when the editing gets done.

283
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,180
I think June our editor.

284
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,280
Is going to TwitchCon.

285
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,020
So I think.

286
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,000
If it's not next Monday.

287
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,140
It might be a bit later.

288
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:33,900
We'll see.

289
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,000
The fear.

290
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
We're on this game.

291
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320

292
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,840

00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,260

297
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,060

00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,800
Okay.

300
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,520
Oh no.

301
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,680
We're an office worker.

302
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,480
Needed coffee to get done with the day.

303
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,100
Oh no.

304
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,020
No.

305
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,600
This is.

306
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,980
I'm fathoming.

307
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,080
I'm fathoming the fear.

308
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,640
Oh look.

309
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,760

Wallpaper.

312
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,080
It's like Nyan Cat.

313
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,260
Oh my gosh.

314
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,240
I can.

315
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,180
Apex.

316
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,380
Legends.

317
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,500
What did it say?

318
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,220
I actually don't know.

319
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,100
What else should we type?

320
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,020
What else should we type?

321
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,360
Let's go to.

322
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,200
Let's go to.

323
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,320
Browser.

324
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,890
I'm feeling lucky.

325
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:09,730
Oh I'm lucky.

326
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,470
Okay.

327
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:11,770
Hold on.

328
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,710
Google is broken.

329
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,970
Put all business funds into your bank account.

330
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:18,270
And run.

331
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,350
I'm going to make a new folder.

332
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,310
I'm going to call it.

333
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,590

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,130
Type invader.

335
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,880

336
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,420

337
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,660

This is awesome.

374
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,700
I wasn't.

375
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,900
I wasn't ready for this though.

376
00:16:59,480 --> 00:16:59,640
Uh.

377
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,540

Okay.

383
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:13,520
I'm.

384
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,580
I've trained for this.

385
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,820
I trained for this.

386
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,200
I'm ready.

387
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:16,880
Uh.

388
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,140
Oh my gosh.

389
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,080
Ah.

390
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,800
Uh.

391
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,040
Okay.

392
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,640
We're killing it.

393
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,080
We're killing it.

394
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,500
We're killing it.

395
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:34,960
We're killing it.

396
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,420
It's not real words or anything.

397
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,540
What does this mean?

398
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,400
Oh.

399
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,520
Oh.

400
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,860
Beat minigame with 70 plus HP.

401
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,380
Oh.

402
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,900
Accuracy 100%.

403
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,500
Health 100%.

404
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,180
Health 100%.

405
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,200
Health 100%.

406
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,160
GG easy baby.

407
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,240
GG easy baby.

408
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,590
I'm kind of a gamer.

409
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,870
How do I get out of here?

410
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,310
Oh.

411
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,390
I'm kind of a gamer.

412
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:19,670
Oh yeah.

413
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,290
I needed coffee.

414
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,850
I'm feeling lively.

415
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,250
Why are all the lights off in my office though?

416
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:26,850
Wow.

417
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:27,610
The big city.

418
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,270
Wow.

419
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,330
There's even people down there.

420
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,270
There's a lot of people walking for how late it seems.

421
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,650
Oh my god.

422
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,110
Oh sorry.

423
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,810
The car.

424
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,870
Why is it so dark?

425
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,330
Oh.

426
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,210
I couldn't leave just yet.

427
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,110
I had to get coffee.

428
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:44,710
Oh.

429
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,290
Okay.

430
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,210
Just kidding.

431
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,790
Uh.

432
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:51,310
Hold on.

433
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,330
No battery.

434
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:52,810
Wait.

435
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,410
No I was.

436
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,290
What's the.

437
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,990
No what's the menu?

438
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,310
That's me pressing escape.

439
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,250
How do I get to the.

440
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,850
I feel like the sensitivity is a little strange.

441
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,750
It's a little high.

442
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,770
I think.

443
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,930
Can I run?

444
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,110
Okay.

445
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:06,490
Kinda.

446
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,090
I hear something.

447
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,330
It's like a clinky.

448
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,150
Oh.

449
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:23,650
Oh hello.

450
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,110
Hey.

451
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,530
What do you want Sid?

452
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,250
I'm trying to get this done.

453
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:30,670
Uh.

454
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,530
Why are you being such a.

455
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,410
Why are you shaft tilting at me?

456
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,430
Oh my gosh.

457
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,550
I was just checking if you need anything.

458
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,630
Can't these clients ever make up their minds.

459
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,210
Still working.

460
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:45,750
Wait.

461
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,850
How is he working without even looking at the screen?

462
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,570
This guy.

463
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,530
He's a maniac.

464
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,310
Oh my god.

465
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:58,890
Oh my god.

466
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,290
Still working on that report?

467
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:01,690
Yeah.

468
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,950
I'm trying to get this done.

469
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,630
I would wish him good luck.

470
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,710
But I don't think he needs it.

471
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,890
I think he knows what he's doing.

472
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,550
Don't burn yourself out.

473
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:12,850
Whatever.

474
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,050
Okay jerk.

475
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,190
Trying to be nice to you.

476
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,570
Oh as much as I wanted to leave.

477
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:19,970
Okay.

478
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,690
I want to look out at the people.

479
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,950
There's a lot of people walking.

480
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,090
There's a lot going on out there.

481
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:29,490
Alright.

482
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:31,090
Coffee.

483
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,450
Coffee.

484
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,510
What else we got here?

485
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,070
Can't read any of these post-it notes.

486
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,090
It's like reading something in a dream.

487
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:40,690
What's this?

488
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:41,710
Oh.

489
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,050
Maybe he wants some chips.

490
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,150
Throw something at him.

491
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:46,390
Yeah.

492
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,590
He wants these chips.

493
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:48,830
Hungry?

494
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,810
I swear if one more thing hits my desk.

495
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,870
I'm going to tell HR about this.

496
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,390
Oh my bad.

497
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,290
You're asking for it.

498
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,990
I swear.

499
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,750
I swear.

500
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,150
Okay.

501
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,470
He's just going to repeat the same stuff.

502
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:08,750
Do you mind?

503
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,690
Some of us are actually working here.

504
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,750
Are you?

505
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,690
You're asking for it.

506
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:14,870
Okay.

507
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,030
That managed to actually land on his desk.

508
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,690
We'll take that as the win.

509
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,550
We got some fizz.

510
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:23,390
Wait.

511
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,990
Choose your drink.

512
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,990
We got a fizz.

513
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,550
We got a Mountain Pew.

514
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,030
We got a Red Cola.

515
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,370
We got a Energy Bowl.

516
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,670
We got a Prepsy.

517
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,630
We got a Dr. Fizz.

518
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,210
Which one would you guys like?

519
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,310
And it's 85 cents.

520
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,250
That's cheap.

521
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,650
A fizz.

522
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,470
Dr. Fizz.

523
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:52,770
Prepsy.

524
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:54,890
Energy Bowl.

525
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,490
I can only pick one you guys.

526
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,090
You guys gotta decide on one.

527
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,270
The children yearn for the Red 40.

528
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,610
No, it's Energy Bowl.

529
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,730
Not Red Bowl.

530
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,030
Okay.

531
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,470
Pick the doctor.

532
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,330
Dr. Fizz.

533
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,830
Dr. Fizz.

534
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,950
Oh.

535
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,800
Whoa!

536
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,140
Scroll up to open.

537
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,520
Right.

538
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,600
Press the mouse button to drink.

539
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,460
Wow.

540
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,700
That was crisp.

541
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,740
That was clean.

542
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,840
I was done with it.

543
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,880
Can I get more?

544
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,400
Oh.

545
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,740
Let's try them all.

546
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,460
Let's try them all.

547
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,280
Dang.

548
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,260
I tried to grab it.

549
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,780
Ready for this?

550
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,730
Throw an unopened one at that guy.

551
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,230
I tried to murder him.

552
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,970
I'll throw an empty one at him.

553
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,900
I was done with it.

554
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,580
Do you mind?

555
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:24,980
Gosh.

556
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,640
You're making such a mess at your desk.

557
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,660
Wait.

558
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,380
This is just rolling.

559
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,860
Maybe this place really is haunted.

560
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,800
Slowly and slowly.

561
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,000
Endless inertia.

562
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,760
There's nothing to ever stop it from moving.

563
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,580
It'll just keep going on.

564
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:43,660
I don't know.

565
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,280
On and on forever.

566
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,740
Slowly and surely.

567
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,100
Where are we anyway?

568
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,100
EPSOL Solicitor's Office.

569
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,000
Shepherd Title Group.

570
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,680
Suya Maritime Counseling.

571
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,280
What are these names?

572
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,180
I wonder how far it'll get.

573
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,740
If I walk...

574
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,760
Nope.

575
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,720
Even walking on top of it doesn't stop it.

576
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,320
Alright.

577
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,000
Where's my coffee?

578
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,060
Coffee.

579
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:17,180
Wait.

580
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,640
Did it just...

581
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,880
Oh my gosh.

582
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,780
It's also just going.

583
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,920
The cans yearn for the mines.

584
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,960
They're all going this way.

585
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,060
There's something down there.

586
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,210
Coffee?

587
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,550
Is that cheese in the freezer?

588
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,490
Where's the coffee?

589
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,010
Oh here we go.

590
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,910
Needed to prepare a cup of coffee.

591
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,350
Oh.

592
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,270
Which flavor do we want?

593
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,450
I want a light roast.

594
00:24:59,370 --> 00:24:59,890
Okay.

595
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,930
How do I do this?

596
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,530
What is this thing?

597
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:08,690
My cup?

598
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,490
It needed water.

599
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,540
Check the calculator.

600
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,660
I think it's on the table.

601
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,040
Does it say 80085?

602
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,120
Oh.

603
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,100
I thought that was the power.

604
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,460
My coffee's looking a little red there.

605
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:39,620
Oh.

606
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,300
Needed a lid.

607
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,600
We like it.

608
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,340
We like it black.

609
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,060
Oh here it is.

610
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,240
My hands were full.

611
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,040
Uh.

612
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,860
Is that it?

613
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,280
Wow.

614
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,800
These sound effects are something.

615
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,880
Why is nobody else here except us?

616
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,920
Am I done with it?

617
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,940
Oh I'm done with it.

618
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,620
Garbage day!

619
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,760
I like how he's just my garbage can.

620
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:26,540
Wait.

621
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:26,960
Did it stop?

622
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,740
It finally stopped.

623
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,240
What does it say?

624
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,240
It's too blurry for me to read.

625
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,660
I can't read it at all.

626
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,200
What does it say?

627
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:48,580
Oh.

628
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,260
Hold on.

629
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:49,740
Oh.

630
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,260
I turned down the quality.

631
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,320
So that's probably why.

632
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,980
Cause you know sometimes with these like indie games you can never tell if they're going to be like badly optimized.

633
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:10,960
And so I usually just turn them down so that like automatically so that um and I can't change it cause the menu just says no battery.

634
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:24,260
But I'll as soon as I can I'll make it cause sometimes you know they're poorly optimized and they're really laggy or...

635
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,240
something.

636
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,580
So why is over here so scary looking?

637
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,840
Needed to use restroom.

638
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,720
Okay I saw the sign over here.

639
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,500
Just charge your phone.

640
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,340
I'm trying!

641
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,880
Where's my computer at?

642
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,220
Oh here?

643
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,530
Can I?

644
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,870
Had to pee.

645
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,490
Okay.

646
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:48,590
Gosh.

647
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,730
This place is so creepy.

648
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,330
I don't like it.

649
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,450
Coffee went through us for real for real.

650
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,410
Had to pee.

651
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,990
I need this getaway now.

652
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,370
Pronto stat.

653
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,470
Wait can we just leave?

654
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:19,900
Hello?

655
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,780
Do we need a key?

656
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,300
Remember your cutout?

657
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,160
The face connect booth at AMIC it watches me sleep every day.

658
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,360
Wait you got it!

659
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,820
Oh I'm a girl?

660
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,120
Oh.

661
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,120
Oh.

662
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,680
Oh.

663
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,700
Gross.

664
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,980
This place is the worst bathroom I've ever seen.

665
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,580
Why are there so many sinks?

666
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,500
Why?

667
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,080
Why are these like the naughty sinks?

668
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,640
Why are there seats facing into the bathroom?

669
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,540
Are we not?

670
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:06,980
I'm scared.

671
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,700
There's a toilet meter!

672
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,090
Oh!

673
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,410
Did

674
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,600
you hear that person walk?

675
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,440
Was that the other?

676
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:43,040
Did he get mad because I threw too much stuff at him?

677
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,280
Is he mad because I threw too much stuff at him?

678
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,800
He walked into the bathroom!

679
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,780
Oh my god!

680
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,300
Oh my god!

681
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:53,620
Oh my god!

682
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:53,700
Oh my god!

683
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,220
He's gonna kill me!

684
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:54,700
Oh my god!

685
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:54,980
Oh my god!

686
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,180
Oh my god!

687
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,040
Don't look up!

688
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,420
Don't look up!

689
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,280
Ah!

690
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,160
I'm sorry!

691
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,780
I'm sorry!

692
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:05,980
I hear footsteps.

693
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:06,320
Yeah!

694
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,620
Someone came into the bathroom!

695
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,800
We gotta wash our hands!

696
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,760
We didn't even flush!

697
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:13,680
Okay.

698
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,600
We flushed.

699
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,800
I think she didn't look left.

700
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,040
I think she didn't look left.

701
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,300
What's there?

702
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:18,700
Ah!

703
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:20,940
Ah!

704
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,640
Okay.

705
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,340
Okay!

706
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,020
We're fine!

707
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,380
We're fine!

708
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,640
Oh!

709
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,100
Oh!

710
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,440
Wow!

711
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,180
Wow, ma'am!

712
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:42,460
Sorry!

713
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,160
Didn't know anyone was in here!

714
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,800
Holy cannoli!

715
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,540
Mister!

716
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,100
You almost gave me a heart attack!

717
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,780
I'm so sorry.

718
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,640
Should've knocked before I came in, but there isn't usually anyone here this late.

719
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,200
Yeah, you should've knocked.

720
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,740
Again, I'm sorry.

721
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,640
I usually do knock, but I'm a little bit frustrated tonight.

722
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,780
Must've slipped my mind.

723
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,780
We're just having a conversation with this guy in the bathroom?

724
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,020
He seems a little excited to be in here.

725
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,040
What has you frustrated?

726
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,980
Someone keeps throwing coffee cups on the floor.

727
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,160
On the floor all over the office.

728
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,100
It's been happening for weeks.

729
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,870
Yeah, that's me.

730
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:39,990
Yeah, that's me.

731
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,550
Did someone raise you in a barn?

732
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,450
There's trash cans all over the office!

733
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,190
Act like an adult and use them!

734
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,970
I'm not sorry for my actions.

735
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,110
Well, I need to get back to it.

736
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,470
Don't want to be picking...

737
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,750
Don't want to be here all night picking up coffee cups.

738
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,530
Have a good night.

739
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:07,530
Have a good night.

740
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,210
Oh my god, that's how I fold up my boxes too.

741
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,870
Did I just see a bug crawl across the...

742
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,030
ground?

743
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:22,610
Did I just see a bug crawl across the...

744
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:23,530
ground?

745
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,530
Get me out of here!

746
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,690
I didn't even wash my hands!

747
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,110
I didn't even wash my hands!

748
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:31,790
Okay, hold on.

749
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:32,310
There we go.

750
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,690
Order of operations.

751
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,450
Dry, but don't wash.

752
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:39,570
What's this?

753
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,130
I don't even know what this is.

754
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,230
Oh, it's a towel dispenser?

755
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,030
Oh, we'll dry our hands...

756
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:45,890
but we won't take the towel.

757
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:01,330
Alright, let's get back to work.

758
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,990
Someone's calling me.

759
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,090
I can still hear him humming.

760
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,210
The guy is...

761
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,150
so loud.

762
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,350
Moshi moshi!

763
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:21,870
Um...

764
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,930
Go for Sidney Harper?

765
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,410
What does that mean?

766
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,570
Go for Sidney Harper?

767
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:28,850
Hey Harp, it's Mike!

768
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:29,390
Oh!

769
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:31,370
Mike.

770
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,070
Hey Mike!

771
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:35,110
I've been trying to call your cell for the last two hours.

772
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,830
It just keeps going to voicemail.

773
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,370
Is everything alright?

774
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,350
Oh!

775
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,490
My battery dies at the worst times!

776
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,990
Oh snap!

777
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:46,530
I was starting to think maybe you were ignoring me.

778
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,010
I was starting to think maybe you were ignoring me.

779
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:48,930
Uh...

780
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,150
Uh...

781
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,870
Hi ghost lady.

782
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:53,210
Hello!

783
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,350
Thanks for the super chat.

784
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:01,590
Awkward laugh.

785
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:07,850
No!

786
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,390
I'm just gonna...

787
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,150
I'm just kidding.

788
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,750
Anyway, what are you still doing at work?

789
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,370
It's getting kind of late.

790
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,210
Why are you calling me at work?

791
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:22,710
It is late.

792
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,090
Why are you calling me Mike?

793
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:25,970
Um...

794
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,670
Just more overtime?

795
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,970
Damn Harp, that sounds rough.

796
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,750
Good thing I called to cheer you up.

797
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,370
No response.

798
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:35,610
Um...

799
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,170
About our trip.

800
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,030
Did you get a chance to book the rental house?

801
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,050
Just really wanted to see you.

802
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,570
And Nora.

803
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,270
I think Mike is into us.

804
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:48,710
I think Mike is into us.

805
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,150
Hmm...

806
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,970
I was going to do it after work.

807
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,410
No worries, Harper.

808
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,750
I don't want to stress you out.

809
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,010
As long as you book it tonight, I think it will be fine.

810
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,490
Is he... does he or does Mike like us?

811
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:02,730
Hey.

812
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:03,830
Hey.

813
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:10,250
I was thinking since we both live in the city, maybe I could pick you up and ride together.

814
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,670
It would be nice to catch up.

815
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,050
He's picking me up!

816
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,330
He's picking me up!

817
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,110
He's picking me up!

818
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:18,110
He's picking me up!

819
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,110
You know, save on gas and relive the good old days.

820
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:24,350
Just a little bit of Mike and Sidney time before Nora gets there.

821
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,070
Mike Wazowski?

822
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,850
Mike and Sidney time?

823
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:27,790
Uh...

824
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:30,710
There's... I can't... I can't reject him!

825
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,790
I can only say yes?

826
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,670
Okay, sure.

827
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:37,650
Great.

828
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,110
I guess I'll let you get back to work then.

829
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,450
Okay, Mike.

830
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,430
I kinda like Mike.

831
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:43,590
Oh, wait.

832
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:44,310
One more thing.

833
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,250
Okay, Columbo.

834
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,690
When you book the rental, please make sure to keep it under $100.

835
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,650
Okay.

836
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,310
A thrifty guy.

837
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,370
Nora and I were talking and she's been on a pretty tight budget.

838
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,430
Things haven't been going very well for her.

839
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:58,610
Things haven't been going very well for her.

840
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,090
I could just hang up without saying bye!

841
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,250
I could just hang up without saying bye!

842
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,270
I could just be like, I...

843
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,590
I don't even say anything.

844
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,270
Also, you're spilling Nora's like...

845
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,650
dirty, you know, laundry like that.

846
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:17,850
You know?

847
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,950
But for Nora, I'll find something affordable.

848
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,290
It'll be just like the old college days.

849
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,810
You always had a knack for finding the best spots.

850
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:28,450
You always had a knack for finding the best spots.

851
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,610
Remember that little cafe you found on our trip to Oregon?

852
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:31,910
Remember that little cafe you found on our trip to Oregon?

853
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:31,990
Remember that little cafe you found on our trip to Oregon?

854
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,550
I should really make the booking now.

855
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,310
The Nook Cafe!

856
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,070
Yeah.

857
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,470
I miss those days, Harp.

858
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,130
Harp?

859
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,090
I thought my name was Sydney.

860
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,030
I should really make the booking now.

861
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:44,790
Right, right.

862
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:45,250
Of course.

863
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,470
Sorry for yapping.

864
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,270
I'm just excited.

865
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:48,770
I guess.

866
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,310
Mom!

867
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,590
Mike sounds cute!

868
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:54,970
Nora?

869
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,090
I hardly Nora.

870
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,110
Stop!

871
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,690
Oh, my last name is Sydney Harper.

872
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:01,650
Oh, okay, okay.

873
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,550
Oh, he sounds cute.

874
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:03,990
All right.

875
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,130
Talk to you later, Harp.

876
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:05,750
Bye!

877
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,570
Maybe I'm judging the guy too hard.

878
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,730
I'm judging the guy too hard.

879
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,110
Okay, we're gonna make a booking, right?

880
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,830
So we're gonna go to browser.

881
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:15,790
We're gonna go...

882
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:16,970
What the?

883
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:18,850
That's not what I typed.

884
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:20,710
Sexy... No, no, no, no!

885
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:20,990
Stop!

886
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,770
I was looking up sexy hotels!

887
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,110
Sexy... No, no, no, no!

888
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:27,870
Please!

889
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,650
This man is trying so hard to catch a date.

890
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:31,710
Yeah, stop!

891
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,150
I'm not gonna say that name.

892
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,090
I'm not gonna say that name.

893
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:34,930
You cannot get me.

894
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,880
If I do it really fast, do you think the game will...

895
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,380
Sexy hotel!

896
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,440
Rentacabin.com!

897
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,900
I'm feeling unlucky.

898
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,860
It's my birthday!

899
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,680
I'm peeling and boiling potatoes in my hotel room.

900
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,540
In your hotel room?

901
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,680
How are you gonna cook that?

902
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,780
John, happy birthday!

903
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,040
Happy birthday to you.

904
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,880
Happy birthday to you.

905
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,840
Happy birthday dear John.

906
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,060
Happy birthday dear John.

907
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,940
You're a pretty okay guy.

908
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,800
Happy birthday to you.

909
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,460
Happy birthday to you.

910
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,260
Happy birthday!

911
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,820
Where are we going?

912
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,620
To hell.

913
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,480
Oh, wood.

914
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,660
Burry.

915
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,780
Search.

916
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,740
Alright.

917
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,260
$3.50 a night!

918
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,940
Holy moly.

919
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,260
Peaceful cabinet.

920
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,460
Oh, but it's got four stars.

921
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,580
$2.40...

922
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,060
This does not look like a $2.40 a night kind of...

923
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,520
$2 stars!

924
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,280
Okay, come on.

925
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,300
Why do we even have security cameras?

926
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:47,760
That's scary.

927
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,360
Cozy Lodge.

928
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:51,820
Woodbury.

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,300
Wow!

930
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,320
$1.99 a night and five stars.

931
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,820
This looks cozy.

932
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,900
It's got a smoke alarm.

933
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,640
I think those are mandatory.

934
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,120
I think you shouldn't just advertise that.

935
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,000
I think that should be a given.

936
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
A surveillance camera.

937
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,200
Private cabin in Woodbury.

938
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,660
$1.99 a night!

939
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,940
Okay, that's under $100.

940
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,180
What a coincidence.

941
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,320
It's my birthday, too.

942
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:27,880
Happy birthday, John.

943
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,660
Rios!

944
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,260
Happy birthday!

945
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,340
Happy birthday to you!

946
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,540
Happy birthday to you!

947
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,840
Happy birthday, dear Rios!

948
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,760
Happy birthday to you!

949
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,060
Happy birthday!

950
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,400
Thank you so much!

951
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,320
$2.59!

952
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,120
$2.59!

953
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,460
$2.59!

954
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:55,740
Okay, but what if we get this place, the $1.99 place, and I cover most of it, you know?

955
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,320
Because it's got really nice reviews.

956
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,920
I mean, this one only has three stars.

957
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,400
But it's got fishing.

958
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,060
It was over our budget.

959
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:06,740
Oh, dang.

960
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,120
Dang it!

961
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,080
I have to do it.

962
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,240
I have to get this one.

963
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,540
Three guests.

964
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,880
Oh, that's how many we are.

965
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,560
Two bedroom.

966
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,140
Can we look at the pictures?

967
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:26,520
No.

968
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,120
Two beds.

969
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:28,540
Wait.

970
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,960
Wait, wait, wait.

971
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,840
Is this why he wanted...

972
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,160
Is this why Mike wanted a...

973
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,400
one under $100?

974
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,560
So that we could have...

975
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,940
a two bedroom location.

976
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,700
A two bedroom With two beds.

977
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,160
Mike, you dog.

978
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,080
Michael!

979
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,420
Ah!

980
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,040
For Supa.

981
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,180
Thank you!

982
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,740
Hey, I'm assuming you get hundreds if not thousands of stories sent daily.

983
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,720
So I'll give you a basic rundown of something that happened to me.

984
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,140
I'm sorry if some of it is written weird, but I was rushed.

985
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,160
Oh, so that must be the email that he got about the story.

986
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,640
Game Dev, right?

987
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,300
Hold on.

988
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,120
Sorry, I'm eating my dinner a little bit.

989
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,940
Yeah, we're gonna make Mike sleep on the couch for real.

990
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,140
What's for dinner?

991
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,020
Mac and cheese!

992
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,520
Had to make something fast.

993
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,220
When I was in my early 20's I worked at a big consulting firm in my city.

994
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,640
Life at the firm was a constant juggle of deadlines, client meetings, and trying to prove my worth.

995
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,760
Which didn't leave much room for leisure, let alone a social life.

996
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,180
The job paid well, sure, but at the expense of my mental peace.

997
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,780
I'm Sydney Harper, and this story takes place during one of those days.

998
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:08,760
One of my college friends, Mike, suggested that we take a weekend getaway to rural Vermont, which sounded like a perfect break from my cycle of work.

999
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,940
And my other friend Nora was quick to jump on board as well.

1000
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:23,900
Nora either is third wheeling and does not read the room well, or she read the room exactly well and was just like, no no no Mike, I am not allowing this to happen.

1001
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,600
The plan was simple.

1002
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:32,820
We rent a small cabin, close our shift early on Friday, leave and be back on Monday.

1003
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,960
Mike came to pick me up.

1004
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,880
Two days later.

1005
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,500
Love triangle?

1006
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,660
Maybe Nora's into Mike.

1007
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:43,900
Oh!

1008
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,040
Is this Mike?

1009
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:45,280
Wait!

1010
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,840
Is he on a PSP?

1011
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,120
Mike?

1012
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,520
You're a gamer.

1013
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,040
Oh, Michael Carter is calling me?

1014
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,040
How do I hang up?

1015
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,760
What do you mean hang up?

1016
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:02,370
Oh wow, okay.

1017
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:03,590
Just booked.

1018
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,230
Do you ever answer the phone anymore?

1019
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,010
Call me please.

1020
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:07,410
Gosh.

1021
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:09,250
Okay Michael.

1022
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,250
Wait, we have a lot.

1023
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:11,930
Yo Harp, how have you been?

1024
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:12,710
Mike!

1025
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,430
I'm literally so tired.

1026
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,250
I was just about to turn in for the night.

1027
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:19,250
Wibby.

1028
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:20,970
Not much.

1029
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:22,570
What the hell?

1030
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:26,010
What?

1031
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:31,470
What's so...

1032
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:32,030
Typo.

1033
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:33,750
Typo in the chat.

1034
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:37,050
Just keeping things afloat, my friend.

1035
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:38,970
How's the work at the new firm?

1036
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,930
Pretty much the same as the old job.

1037
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,170
Bibicor, thanks for the gifted.

1038
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,510
It means, what about you?

1039
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:53,180
Wibby.

1040
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,050
I like my version better.

1041
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:08,050
I

1042
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,400
think I'm more used to seeing it as an actual U.

1043
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,340
Instead of the Y.

1044
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,020
That's what threw me off.

1045
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,640
I think most people type W-B-U.

1046
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,600
How's the work at the new firm?

1047
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,860
Pretty much the same as the old job.

1048
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,980
Just coding my life away, but the pay is better.

1049
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,000
Anyway, I've been thinking about our chat from earlier today.

1050
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,620
Oh Mike, like I really don't know.

1051
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,760
Getting away sounds fun, but it'll be so much work to get packed and leave for the weekend.

1052
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,360
All I'm going to do is think about all the work I should be getting done at the office.

1053
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,740
You have to take weekends off.

1054
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:53,560
Wibby!

1055
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:53,780
Wibby!

1056
00:44:58,670 --> 00:44:59,670
Wibby at the chat!

1057
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:00,770
Thanks for the super chat!

1058
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:09,290
I can't tell if you changed your name or if that was your username already and you were like, who mentioned me?

1059
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,570
Listen to yourself, harp.

1060
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:25,590
We're talking about taking a nice dot dot dot, relaxing dot dot dot, weekend getaway and all you're focusing on is how to make all you are focusing on is how to make relaxing.

1061
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:27,950
What?

1062
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:32,350
I haven't had a real break in break in ages, Mike.

1063
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,050
I'm not even sure I remember how to relax anymore.

1064
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:40,370
I work all day and when I get home all I think about is work.

1065
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,310
I didn't get finished.

1066
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:43,010
It's hard to just unplug, you know?

1067
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,470
And that's exactly why you should come.

1068
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,760
Think of it this way, Sydney Harper.

1069
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,420
You're like a battery full of power and productivity.

1070
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,540
But what happens when you run the battery too long?

1071
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,040
It loses its charge.

1072
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,100
We've got to put you back on the charger, harp.

1073
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,880
You'll go back to work after the weekend with more energy than ever.

1074
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,040
20% more productivity, I bet.

1075
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,060
Come on.

1076
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,580
Why did he use the Lenny face?

1077
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,860
I don't know.

1078
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,780
Who knows?

1079
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,740
Maybe you'll thank me later.

1080
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,180
What?

1081
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,300
Plus, Nora is really excited about it.

1082
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,020
It wouldn't be the same without you.

1083
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,700
Sorry, passed out last night.

1084
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:29,760
Damn it.

1085
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,160
Fine.

1086
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:30,580
All right.

1087
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,580
I'll check in with HR and let you know.

1088
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,140
What do you mean?

1089
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,060
It's the weekend.

1090
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,120
You shouldn't have to check in with HR.

1091
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,800
Take your time, harp.

1092
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,740
And just know that whatever you decide, we're here for you.

1093
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,020
Smiley heart.

1094
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:44,740
Yo, harp.

1095
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,440
Your cell keeps going straight to voicemail.

1096
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:46,980
Everything okay?

1097
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,320
Call me back.

1098
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,160
I'm getting a little worried.

1099
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,200
Just booked.

1100
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,940
Do you ever answer the phone anymore?

1101
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:52,760
Call me, please.

1102
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,040
I'm off work now.

1103
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,220
Okay, I'm headed that way.

1104
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,900
Pulling into the parking garage now.

1105
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,880
You downstairs yet?

1106
00:46:59,420 --> 00:46:59,820
Wibby.

1107
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,440
Oh, it won't let me erase it?

1108
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,000
Oh, gosh.

1109
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:04,460
Wait.

1110
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,180
Okay, there we go.

1111
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,880
And here we have Sydney from Rent-A-Cabin.

1112
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,000
Thanks for booking my property in Woodbury for December 10th to 12th.

1113
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,800
I'm Rick, your host.

1114
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,840
Let me know if you have any questions and feel free to contact me for anything during your day.

1115
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,340
Looking forward to hosting you.

1116
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,020
Thanks, Rick.

1117
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:22,760
Thanks, Rick.

1118
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:26,820
We're looking forward to forward it.

1119
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,480
Just confirming the check-in time is 3 p.m., right?

1120
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:31,400
That's correct.

1121
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,720
The key will be in a lockbox by the front door.

1122
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,360
Call me if you have any trouble getting it open.

1123
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,120
Have a safe trip.

1124
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:37,680
Great.

1125
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,220
Thank you.

1126
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,400
Oh, wow.

1127
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:43,860
We have a lot.

1128
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,620
Oh, my gosh.

1129
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,680
Friends 3 ever.

1130
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,800
What the hell is this?

1131
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,580
Oh, my gosh.

1132
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,280
What is...

1133
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,020
There is so much going on here.

1134
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,460
We're popular.

1135
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,120
Harpy!

1136
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,760
It's been over a year since I saw your stwipped face.

1137
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:02,700
Ha!

1138
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:03,880
It'll be fun, right?

1139
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,360
It'll be like the girls trip we planned during our sophomore year.

1140
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,800
The one that never ended up happening.

1141
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:11,620
Lololol.

1142
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,400
Yumi and Taylor?

1143
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:13,820
Haha.

1144
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,220
That was such a long time ago.

1145
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,220
Why didn't we go?

1146
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,120
Baxter took her to a concert?

1147
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:20,620
I think?

1148
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,100
We just never tried again.

1149
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,880
You know, I can't be mad at her for not inviting us to the wedding.

1150
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:29,360
We all just kind of lost touch with each other.

1151
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,840
But we're gonna change that this weekend.

1152
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,280
I'm so excited!

1153
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,700
But are you gonna drive alone?

1154
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,620
Yeah, I've done it before.

1155
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:37,740
Don't you worry, girl.

1156
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,540
I'll probably get there a little late, though.

1157
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:43,320
One of my clients wants to do a review that afternoon.

1158
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,840
You can probably tag with Mike, though, since you both live in the city.

1159
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,640
Yeah, I'll talk to him about it.

1160
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,640
We can burn up his gas.

1161
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,080
Smiley.

1162
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:53,700
Thanks, girl!

1163
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,520
Can't wait to give you the biggest hug!

1164
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,900
Me too too too!

1165
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,700
People type like this for real.

1166
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,320
What is Friends 3 Eva?

1167
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,500
This is so cute.

1168
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,980
Oh, this is the Taylor girl, right?

1169
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,200
And she... Oh my god, this is so shady.

1170
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:21,560
Nora posts about Taylor getting married in the group chat?

1171
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,940
I'm assuming with Taylor?

1172
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,940
Wait, who's in this group chat?

1173
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,000
Oh, Michael.

1174
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,780
Oh, this is Mike.

1175
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:30,560
Okay.

1176
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,680
Like, not forever.

1177
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:35,540
Oh, I don't even think Taylor's in this group chat.

1178
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,860
I was gonna say, that's really shady to be like, Taylor, look!

1179
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,480
Wait, what's this?

1180
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,320
Here's the thing, guys.

1181
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,940
I'm on a tight budget.

1182
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,620
Like, I'm eating ramen noodles for every meal.

1183
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,460
Kind of tight.

1184
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,300
Not to mention, I really need to put a new set of tires on the car.

1185
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:54,820
If we could find something in the ballpark of $100 per night, I think I can still make it work.

1186
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:55,820
I don't know.

1187
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,220
Let me know if that's okay with you.

1188
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,020
I hope I get to see you both soon.

1189
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,020
Is this Lily Pichu?

1190
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,040
Just kinda sound like her, doesn't it?

1191
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:04,320
Hold on.

1192
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,900
Here's the thing, guys.

1193
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,480
I'm on a tight budget.

1194
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,180
Like, I'm eating ramen noodles for every meal.

1195
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,000
Kind of tight.

1196
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,820
Not to mention, I really need to put a new set of tires on the car.

1197
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,360
If we could find something in the ballpark of $100 per night, I think I can still make it work.

1198
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,360
I don't know.

1199
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,760
Let me know if that's okay with you.

1200
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,580
I hope I get to see you both soon.

1201
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,800
Is she the one setting up the bedroom situation?

1202
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,400
Oh, maybe.

1203
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,140
We know you're a millionaire at heart, Nora.

1204
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,780
The fanciest woman we know.

1205
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:41,820
Stop!

1206
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,740
XD jump scare.

1207
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:45,720
Oh, wait.

1208
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,500
My hair is blocking it.

1209
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:48,100
XD!

1210
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,240
Lol.

1211
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:54,840
Lol.

1212
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:57,440
XD Oh.

1213
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,040
What is this?

1214
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,420
Oh, my stuff.

1215
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:06,580
XD Ding bong.

1216
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:10,530
Hello?

1217
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:13,730
What was that guy who was just like chilling in the elevator?

1218
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:17,610
She can definitely afford more than $100?

1219
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:18,690
This is definitely a setup?

1220
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:19,430
Oh!

1221
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:21,350
Ah!

1222
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:29,910
Stay away from me!

1223
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:31,210
The luggage is holding me down.

1224
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:31,550
Ah!

1225
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:33,770
Stay away!

1226
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:40,430
She's got a pickup truck!

1227
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:42,250
Hold on.

1228
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:42,990
Let's throw it at him.

1229
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:45,670
Let's throw it at him.

1230
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,940
Why does he look like Jack's films?

1231
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:55,640
Harp.

1232
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,060
Hug!

1233
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:56,780
Oh!

1234
00:51:59,260 --> 00:51:59,740
Ah!

1235
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,880
That's still how you hug people?

1236
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,960
What's wrong with how I hug people?

1237
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,780
Why don't you hug me like you missed me?

1238
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,960
Just a test hug to see if you smelled first.

1239
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,060
What if we're just so awkward and terrible with him the entire time?

1240
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,780
What if we're just like...

1241
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,280
XD

1242
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,470
You look good.

1243
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:41,830
You can just throw your stuff in the back and we'll get on our way.

1244
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:43,830
I mean, tougher handing.

1245
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,330
No, I feel like we're gonna miss out on story if I...

1246
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:49,830
you know.

1247
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:51,950
Alright then, Harp.

1248
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:53,370
Are you ready to hit the road?

1249
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:55,090
Where's Nora?

1250
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:57,030
She'll meet us there.

1251
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:02,110
The route through the city would have been a detour for her anyway.

1252
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:04,670
Alright then, Harp.

1253
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:12,730
He's aggressive.

1254
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:13,930
He's aggressive.

1255
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:13,950
He's aggressive.

1256
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,390
What happened to the guy with the PSP?

1257
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:22,830
What did he do with Nora?

1258
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,250
4.26 PM?

1259
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:26,050
It was night time though, wasn't it?

1260
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:27,530
Am I crazy?

1261
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:32,450
This is kind of nice.

1262
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,450
It was starting to snow.

1263
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:42,430
Oh.

1264
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:43,770
Um.

1265
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:45,030
Uh.

1266
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:46,830
It's kind of romantic.

1267
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,110
Um.

1268
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:51,610
The moon is beautiful.

1269
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:53,690
Harp.

1270
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:55,670
Isn't it weird?

1271
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:58,310
We used to dream about escaping our college.

1272
00:53:58,490 --> 00:53:59,730
And now here we are.

1273
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:03,490
Trying to escape from the life we wanted to live.

1274
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:07,970
Funny how that works.

1275
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,250
Yeah, eyes on the road, mister.

1276
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:12,550
Change is just hard.

1277
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:14,530
Like trying to adjust to the new job.

1278
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:16,250
Uh.

1279
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,190
How's your new job going?

1280
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:23,950
We're working on this project that uses machine learning to predict market trends.

1281
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:25,770
It's pretty cutting edge stuff.

1282
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:30,510
Sounds like you're shaping the future.

1283
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,510
Not quite Tony Stark yet.

1284
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:34,910
But I'll take it.

1285
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:37,050
Let's be nice to him, you guys.

1286
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:37,590
Let's be nice.

1287
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:37,810
Oh.

1288
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:38,710
Mr. Rick.

1289
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,690
You know, I never understood.

1290
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:43,830
What do consultants even do?

1291
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,470
I'm not sure.

1292
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:46,650
I'm not sure.

1293
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,400
Stop looking at me!

1294
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:56,800
Oh my gosh.

1295
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,120
What are we looking at?

1296
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,780
What just happened?

1297
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,300
Did you see that?

1298
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,180
Did you see that school bus?

1299
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,800
See what?

1300
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:08,980
There was a school bus.

1301
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,740
Why does that matter?

1302
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,880
Maybe it's a project.

1303
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:18,240
You know, someone's idea of turning it into a tiny home on wheels or something.

1304
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,220
Yeah, I've read people do that on the internet.

1305
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,120
Yeah.

1306
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,480
Who cares if there's a school bus in their yard?

1307
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:25,540
Okay.

1308
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:30,340
Mr. Rick, it's nearly 5pm and I haven't received a confirmation text for you.

1309
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:31,420
Oh.

1310
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,720
Oh my gosh, we almost died, Mike!

1311
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,620
We almost just died!

1312
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,320
That was close!

1313
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:46,840
You know, I read on the internet that in Native American lore seeing a deer cross your path is like getting a message from the universe.

1314
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:52,200
Well, what is it explaining to us?

1315
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:53,760
Okay, I'm trying to...

1316
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,500
There's like 15 different things going on.

1317
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,200
Um...

1318
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,620
Just wanted to make sure...

1319
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,080
Check in and make sure everything's okay.

1320
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,640
The roads near Woodbury can be a little dangerous if you're not from the area.

1321
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,280
Please let me know when you arrive.

1322
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:05,200
We're on our way.

1323
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,220
Should be there around 6pm.

1324
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,600
The snow slowed us down quite a bit.

1325
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,340
Thanks for checking in.

1326
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,840
Okay, please confirm when you check in and travel safe.

1327
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:12,100
Okay.

1328
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,620
All right.

1329
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,060
Oh gosh.

1330
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,240
Should be about an hour and a half from here.

1331
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:20,640
What?

1332
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,440
An hour and a half?

1333
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,560
You know?

1334
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,400
Driving through the snow kind of feels like we're traveling through the intergalactic space.

1335
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,720
This guy's such a nerd.

1336
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:34,780
What do you mean?

1337
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,900
Look at the way the snowflakes swirl around the headlights.

1338
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,480
He's trying to make this so romantic.

1339
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,660
Like the stars and galaxies rushing past us.

1340
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,100
Okay, Captain Kirk.

1341
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,400
Why are you on the road, please?

1342
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:55,360
Oh my gosh.

1343
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,320
It's kind of...

1344
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:57,900
beautiful.

1345
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,480
Stop looking at me, please.

1346
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,140
He didn't say, like me.

1347
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,860
He didn't even try.

1348
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,220
Mike, I'm not feeling anything right now.

1349
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,640
5.14pm.

1350
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,420
Pretend to be asleep.

1351
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,460
It's 5pm?

1352
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:22,460
Why is it so dark?

1353
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,180
Yo, Harp.

1354
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:26,980
Check that out.

1355
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,740
What am I looking at?

1356
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,040
Pizza?

1357
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:33,920
Moe's Pizza!

1358
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:35,720
Oh.

1359
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,640
Oh, okay.

1360
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,220
Okay.

1361
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,920
Didn't you say this guy sounded cute?

1362
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,560
I'm being judgy, okay?

1363
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,240
But he's fine.

1364
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,120
I'm being judgy, but he's a fine guy.

1365
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:46,860
He's fine.

1366
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,140
He hasn't done anything weird.

1367
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:52,500
He's just a little awkward.

1368
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,640
And he also didn't ask if I wanted pizza or anything.

1369
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,540
You know, Harp, I gotta tell you.

1370
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,060
These new GPS systems are something else.

1371
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,440
This pizzeria is exactly where it appeared on my GPS.

1372
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:09,240
It's like living in the future.

1373
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,780
I'm so hungry.

1374
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,600
I think I...

1375
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,500
How hungry.

1376
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,140
That's a very human thing to say.

1377
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,480
How hungry.

1378
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,460
He's lame, but inoffensive.

1379
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,000
Exactly.

1380
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:33,960
I'm so hungry.

1381
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,800
I think I could eat a whole pizza myself.

1382
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:37,580
Come on.

1383
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,940
Say the line.

1384
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,940
Say the line, Mike.

1385
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:41,820
Me too.

1386
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,580
Alright then, Harp.

1387
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,800
Operation Pizza Pit Stop is a go.

1388
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,380
Prepare to land!

1389
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,900
I kinda like Mike.

1390
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,640
He's a dork.

1391
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,140
He's kinda stupid.

1392
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,680
Okay, now's our chance.

1393
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,620
We're gonna go to that motel.

1394
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:03,220
We're gonna get out of here.

1395
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,360
Okay.

1396
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,400
Mike was waiting for me.

1397
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,880
There's no invisible wall to stop me.

1398
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,300
No!

1399
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,300
It has vacancy!

1400
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,260
What are you waiting for?

1401
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,620
Oh my gosh.

1402
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,780
Can we get hit by the car?

1403
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:25,980
Oh shoot.

1404
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,420
You scared me.

1405
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,060
You're not too discreet.

1406
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,400
Where is he?

1407
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,260
He's holding the door open for us.

1408
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,600
What do they got?

1409
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:41,760
Cheese?

1410
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,280
Veggie?

1411
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,540
No salami?

1412
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,820
Moe's special?

1413
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,100
Mushroom?

1414
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:48,340
Barbecue chicken?

1415
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:49,400
Calzone?

1416
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:53,400
Three dollars for like a single slice?

1417
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,400
Enter my pin.

1418
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,760
It worked?

1419
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:09,720
Wait, what?

1420
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:13,700
Did I just win the lottery?

1421
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:16,500
What?

1422
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,920
I'm gonna take out three hundred dollars.

1423
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,580
Truck Kun was on vacation too.

1424
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,640
Four thousand dollars?

1425
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:35,280
Let's go?

1426
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:36,840
How do I get my cash?

1427
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:42,790
What the hell am I hearing?

1428
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:49,830
I think there's like a TV going on in there or something.

1429
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:52,130
We have four thousand dollars in our bank account!

1430
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:54,210
Damn!

1431
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,630
Mento just unlocked the TikTok chase glitch again.

1432
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:01,150
Dinner's on me, Mikey!

1433
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:03,530
Thank you for the card info, Mento.

1434
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:06,130
I can super chat the freak phantomers.

1435
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:11,210
You guys don't hack my bank account, okay?

1436
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:13,330
Don't hack my bank account.

1437
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:16,650
I'm just a city girl.

1438
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,920
I'm just a city girl.

1439
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,760
Oh yeah, Mike is the dork here.

1440
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,080
Sure.

1441
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:38,420
Well, it's just me and Mike, and uh, definitely ain't me.

1442
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:44,730
I wanna see what the other, um...

1443
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:46,850
Oh, we're on the road, Nora.

1444
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:48,470
Let us know when you get going, okay?

1445
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:52,690
Let's see what all this is about.

1446
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:53,630
OMG.

1447
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:56,030
Did you guys hear about Taylor and Baxter?

1448
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,230
Let me guess.

1449
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:01,550
Baxter got her pregnant, and now they're planning a Star Wars themed baby shower.

1450
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:02,830
This guy is such a nerd!

1451
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:04,330
I can see it now.

1452
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:08,610
A birth announcement that says, the force is strong with this one.

1453
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:18,600
Mikey...

1454
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,060
Did they tie the knot?

1455
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,440
Tell me they didn't get married.

1456
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:24,520
I didn't get an invitation!

1457
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:28,080
Mike, you are the biggest nerd I know, other than Baxter.

1458
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,320
He would totally do that.

1459
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,220
This is so cute!

1460
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,260
All you need is love.

1461
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,760
Aww, so happy for them.

1462
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:39,440
They make me believe in love again.

1463
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:41,140
Right?

1464
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:42,700
I always thought they were so cute together.

1465
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,440
I remember Taylor telling me how they met at a Beatles tribute concert in high school.

1466
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,100
It's too stinking cute.

1467
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,620
That's goals.

1468
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,060
Hashtag goals, everybody.

1469
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:57,840
Our college friends are moving on with their lives and getting married, and I'm here busting my ass and revising designs for a company I don't even care about.

1470
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,200
Blah.

1471
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,540
Why do the pictures look like a Sims 4 screenshot?

1472
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,680
Oh my gosh, it really does.

1473
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,780
Three weeks ago they got married!

1474
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,080
Right?

1475
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:10,960
Oh, oh wait.

1476
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,820
Seriously, I feel you, girl.

1477
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:16,440
May as well put a bed in my office because I feel like I live here.

1478
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,280
We're practically zombies at this point.

1479
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:19,220
Exactly.

1480
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,920
And I miss the city.

1481
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,880
My social life is officially dead.

1482
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,140
Syracuse just doesn't hit the same.

1483
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,180
What is this reaction?

1484
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:36,200
Michael Carter.

1485
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:44,600
I'll tell you a funny story of when I met the English voice for Solid Snake.

1486
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:46,440
Wait, oh my gosh, hold on.

1487
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:52,600
In my Mario cosplay and we both did our own impressions of them apologizing for beating each other up in Smash.

1488
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:53,360
That's so cute!

1489
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,120
Sounds so fun.

1490
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,360
Can't believe it's been a year since the last time we saw each other.

1491
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,700
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

1492
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:03,920
I have a proposal.

1493
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:06,520
To Sydney.

1494
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,360
Not the same kind as...

1495
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,380
Oh wait, oh gosh!

1496
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,780
Not the same kind as Baxter had for Taylor.

1497
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:14,880
What a proposal.

1498
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:16,060
Stop.

1499
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,120
Syracuse hates...

1500
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,640
hate from NoraIsRealAF.

1501
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,060
How about we find a rental house this winter?

1502
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:25,540
Somewhere in Vermont maybe?

1503
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,740
We can chill and relax for a weekend.

1504
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,020
I'm 100% serious.

1505
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:30,780
It'll be like our college days.

1506
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,760
We can watch movies, eat junk food, whatever we want.

1507
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:36,460
Maybe we can get high...

1508
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:37,600
No!

1509
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,060
Michael J.

1510
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:39,540
Carter!

1511
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:40,780
Not on my channel!

1512
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,380
This is...

1513
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,220
This is...

1514
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:46,080
This is a drug-free zone.

1515
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:50,240
I'm sure one of my old contacts could come through.

1516
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,740
Also, I'm afraid of heights.

1517
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,680
That actually sounds like a great idea.

1518
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,000
Our own cozy little getaway for the weekend.

1519
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:00,000
I heart it.

1520
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:01,820
A getaway?

1521
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:02,620
I don't know, Mike.

1522
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:03,660
Sounds like a lot of work.

1523
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:04,880
Plus, I'm swamped right now.

1524
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,820
My boss just dropped two new clients on me this week.

1525
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:10,700
Think about it.

1526
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:10,960
Harpy?

1527
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,880
A weekend away from all the stress?

1528
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:13,800
No work?

1529
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:14,340
No deadlines?

1530
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,760
It'll be like a girl's trip.

1531
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,300
But with Mike, lol.

1532
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,320
Yeah.

1533
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,120
Guy's third wheeling.

1534
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,280
You say like...

1535
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,640
You say it like it's a bad thing.

1536
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:24,920
I don't know, guys.

1537
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,380
I'll get...

1538
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,540
I'll let... I'll let...

1539
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:30,180
I'll let get back with you after I think it over.

1540
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,020
XOXO, gossip girl.

1541
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,980
Honestly, the more I think about it, the more I like the idea.

1542
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,500
That's the spirit, Harpy!

1543
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:37,620
Let's make it happen!

1544
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:39,060
Alright, I'm in.

1545
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,340
But there better be wine involved.

1546
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,360
Alright, good deal.

1547
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:44,800
I'll bring some pizza supplies.

1548
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:48,440
Not the kind of wake and bake Mikey has in mind.

1549
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,080
What's that?

1550
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:50,920
Wake and bake.

1551
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,140
But it'll be so good.

1552
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:55,500
Oh no, and here we are having pizza without Nora!

1553
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:04,100
Wake up.

1554
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:06,740
And smoke.

1555
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:07,500
And smoke.

1556
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:08,100
No!

1557
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,140
What does that have to do with pizza?

1558
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:13,160
What does that have to do with pizza?

1559
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,260
Harp, would you mind taking the lead on booking the house?

1560
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,100
We've always had a knack for finding a great place to stay.

1561
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:20,700
Me?

1562
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:21,300
Book a cabin?

1563
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:22,160
I suppose I could do that.

1564
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:23,680
And then she does the voice message.

1565
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,700
Nora, that's no problem.

1566
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,900
We will make sure to get something reasonably priced.

1567
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:29,300
We've got you, girl.

1568
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,120
Cheap and cozy.

1569
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,420
Don't say cheap, Harpy.

1570
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,340
Makes me sound so...

1571
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:35,580
well, cheap.

1572
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:38,060
Okay, yeah.

1573
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:38,620
Okay, cool.

1574
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:39,960
Alright, pizza time!

1575
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,480
Come on in, Harp.

1576
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:47,360
Thank you, Mike.

1577
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:50,660
What the hell?

1578
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,380
Everyone in that pizzeria is frozen solid.

1579
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:59,120
Residents are recommended to stay indoors and keep warm during this time.

1580
01:06:59,280 --> 01:06:59,720
What is this?

1581
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,160
Let's check in with our field reporter.

1582
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:02,340
Oh no, a snowstorm?

1583
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:02,840
How's the weather out there feel?

1584
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,480
Will Nora be able to get here?

1585
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:05,780
I can't feel my hands, okay?

1586
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,700
The studio should have really brought some snow gear instead of buying that new coffee machine.

1587
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,340
I'm sure you'll be fine.

1588
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:14,020
You can have some coffee when you get back to the studio.

1589
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:16,460
Jerry, you cannot be serious.

1590
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,700
You know my doctor said not to drink any caffeine.

1591
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,980
Sounds like someone's having a bad day.

1592
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:23,640
Maybe you should cool off.

1593
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:25,580
You little shit.

1594
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:28,640
Why can't you go out here and deal with the snow instead of me?

1595
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,020
I've been working here for six years and I never get to report somewhere nice.

1596
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:32,920
Listen, Phil.

1597
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,200
I'm just clearly the better looking one.

1598
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:35,640
Who's Queso?

1599
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,780
You can worry about where you'll report once you get that rhinoplasty.

1600
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:40,880
Rhinoplasty?

1601
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,560
Why would I need rhinoplasty?

1602
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,180
My face looks perfectly fine.

1603
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:45,060
Who is Queso?

1604
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:47,240
You could also use some Botox while you're at it.

1605
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,340
Actually, maybe you should work as a studio light engineer.

1606
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:50,720
The girls are fighting!

1607
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,320
Behind the camera.

1608
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,360
I think it would be a better field of work for you.

1609
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,100
You only got your job because your sister works at the mixing board.

1610
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,520
You would have never been able to work here if it wasn't for her.

1611
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,880
I'd like to see you work the ENG sometime.

1612
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:03,220
How dare you?

1613
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,160
I'm a certified news anchor.

1614
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:05,600
I wanna be in Fierce to Fathom.

1615
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,960
I wanna be a voice actor.

1616
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,140
You didn't do shit.

1617
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,160
How about I come by the studio and we settle this like men?

1618
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:12,900
Oh yeah?

1619
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,440
Well let's do it, punk.

1620
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:15,980
How's the weather?

1621
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,160
We'll be right back at this commercial break.

1622
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:17,740
Oh my god.

1623
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:20,300
But the weather!

1624
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:23,620
Oh.

1625
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:25,900
My bad.

1626
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:26,360
Sorry.

1627
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,620
Is this a music video?

1628
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:30,940
What is going on?

1629
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,720
What the heck is this?

1630
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:36,700
What is happening?

1631
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:38,940
Woah!

1632
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,320
Woah!

1633
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:42,920
Extreme sports!

1634
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:45,440
Oh

1635
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,660
my gosh.

1636
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:53,560
He's gonna die.

1637
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,240
Is

1638
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,620
this a snowman?

1639
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:01,500
What?

1640
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,860
This is the commercial.

1641
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:04,560
What is it selling?

1642
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:05,760
Insurance?

1643
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,480
Is that my office?

1644
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:09,860
Oh my god.

1645
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:12,680
Oh my god.

1646
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:13,180
There's a security.

1647
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,660
There's a live feed of my office.

1648
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:21,200
Oh my god.

1649
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,500
They're playing Fierce to Fathom.

1650
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:36,520
And no, we're not gonna penalize you for that, of course.

1651
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,640
But it's mainly for you that I'm doing this.

1652
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,240
I cannot get over.

1653
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:44,040
Everybody is chewing in my ear.

1654
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:44,720
Shut up.

1655
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,500
Shut up every single one of you.

1656
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:47,200
Please.

1657
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:48,180
Oh my god.

1658
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,060
I can't take it anymore.

1659
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,120
Sorry.

1660
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,320
I have that misoph- phobia.

1661
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,160
Excuse me.

1662
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:57,520
Evening, folks.

1663
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,280
Looks like the cold's got everyone craving pizza tonight.

1664
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:06,080
You fine folks know what you want to eat.

1665
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:11,160
We'll get three slices each.

1666
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:11,900
Okay, Mikey.

1667
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:12,880
Deciding for me.

1668
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,980
I'll go with pepperoni, cheese, and a veggie.

1669
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:17,920
And for you, miss?

1670
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:19,440
Uh...

1671
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:21,540
Uh...

1672
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:22,660
Cheese?

1673
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,860
Alright, what's your second slice?

1674
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,080
Veggie?

1675
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:28,500
The third?

1676
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,540
Let's go with the Moe's special.

1677
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,720
There's a setting in the options that remove chewing sounds.

1678
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:34,220
No way!

1679
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,780
Any drinks for you folks?

1680
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:39,280
That should cover us.

1681
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:39,780
What?

1682
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:40,160
Wait.

1683
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:40,440
No.

1684
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,700
I want like a lemonade.

1685
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:43,800
Come on, Mike.

1686
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:45,880
That should cover us.

1687
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,180
Just the pizza today, thanks.

1688
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:48,740
Alright then.

1689
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:49,880
Six hot slices.

1690
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:51,160
Coming right up.

1691
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,140
That'll be $22.50.

1692
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:55,400
Oh, I'm the one paying!

1693
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:04,940
Your order number is 27.

1694
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:08,520
Grab a seat and we'll call you when your pizza's ready.

1695
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:10,340
I thought you were into me, Mike.

1696
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,620
How do I turn off the sounds?

1697
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,620
You guys, how do I go into the settings?

1698
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,120
There's no way to get into the settings.

1699
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:19,440
Please.

1700
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:21,920
How do I go into the settings?

1701
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,000
If I press escape, this is all I get.

1702
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:26,940
Oh my god!

1703
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,220
How do I...

1704
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:31,180
Tab?

1705
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,180
No, it doesn't work.

1706
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:33,700
Alt F4.

1707
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,400
Oh god!

1708
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,420
Tab out of the game?

1709
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:42,280
No, it doesn't do anything.

1710
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:45,140
Phone settings?

1711
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,420
There is none.

1712
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:50,220
Oh my gosh.

1713
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,600
There's only like a little thing down here that I'm kind of covering.

1714
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:54,340
It says messages and rent a cabin.

1715
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:11,310
Oh god!

1716
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:12,890
The chewing sounds are so bad!

1717
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:14,330
Oh!

1718
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:14,570
Oh!

1719
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:15,750
Hi, sir.

1720
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:17,910
Sorry.

1721
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:20,470
I wanted my own little soda.

1722
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:23,670
How are you doing, my friend?

1723
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:25,070
I'm pretty hungry.

1724
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:27,570
Pizza does smell awfully good.

1725
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:29,650
Going to grab a slice?

1726
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:32,350
No, just looking for a little help.

1727
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:33,890
Maybe I can help you.

1728
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,090
Maybe you can.

1729
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:38,170
But you go on and get some pizza first, eh?

1730
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:39,610
Maybe we'll catch up later.

1731
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:40,370
Alright!

1732
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:44,350
Mikey's like, why are you flirting with that guy?

1733
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:45,310
Why are you flirting with that guy?

1734
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,340
Oh my god.

1735
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:07,160
Hello?

1736
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:09,180
How's the pizza?

1737
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,620
The pizza's great, actually.

1738
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,380
I think Moe's might have ruined other pizzas for us.

1739
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,080
It's our first time in the area.

1740
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:19,100
Oh.

1741
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:19,740
Uh.

1742
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,920
Are you from...

1743
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,800
Wait, she said it's her first time in the area.

1744
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:25,680
Where are you headed?

1745
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:30,260
We're on our way to a conference in the next town over with my buddy here.

1746
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,580
Your buddy is like Sasquatch posing.

1747
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,880
Your buddy just wants to eat his pizza in peace.

1748
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,180
Oh, we don't...

1749
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:46,260
Oh, excuse me.

1750
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:47,800
We're having a conversation here.

1751
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,680
Oh yeah, we just stopped to eat whatever...

1752
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,220
whatever a place looks interesting.

1753
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,020
This place definitely has a cozy vibe.

1754
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,200
This place definitely has a cozy vibe.

1755
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:02,300
How about you?

1756
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,160
Local are just passing through.

1757
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,020
I don't think I'm going to tell you where I'm going.

1758
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:08,180
Yeah, we're just passing through.

1759
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,240
You gotta exit the game to change the settings, unfortunately.

1760
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:11,920
What?

1761
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,780
That's so messed up.

1762
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:14,980
Interesting.

1763
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:16,440
Hmm.

1764
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:19,720
We better get back to this pizza.

1765
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,480
You have a safe trip and be careful in the snow.

1766
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:24,180
You too.

1767
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,240
Oh my god.

1768
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:27,500
Hold on, Mikey.

1769
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,360
I'm being social.

1770
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,140
Craps is at it.

1771
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:31,180
Whoa.

1772
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:33,440
Craps, slow down.

1773
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:34,100
You're going to choke.

1774
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,040
Oh my god.

1775
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,760
He's just shoveling down this pizza.

1776
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:40,660
How's the pizza?

1777
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:42,580
Well, my dear.

1778
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:45,720
You absolutely can't go wrong with the pepperoni here at Moe's.

1779
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:49,000
Every bite reminds you of a story.

1780
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,640
So what brings you to Moe's?

1781
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,620
Oh, so what brings you to Moe's?

1782
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:58,680
I'm here on a road trip with my friend.

1783
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,180
You've made a mistake.

1784
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,640
It's a good choice stopping here.

1785
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:03,280
Do you come here often?

1786
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:04,800
Oh, my dear.

1787
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:07,160
I've been coming to Moe's since 85.

1788
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,600
This place is full of memories for me.

1789
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:15,420
Though my daughter, bless her, she tries to keep me from eating too much pizza.

1790
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:18,580
Yeah, you're desperate for that pizza.

1791
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,540
I think you have an addiction.

1792
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,840
I was kidding when I said all time for.

1793
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,080
The pizza bite of 85.

1794
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:29,700
Bad for a man my age, she says.

1795
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,340
She worries too much.

1796
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:37,700
Only have one of these heavenly slices about twice a month now.

1797
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,560
Well, it was nice chatting with you.

1798
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,080
Safe travels to you and your friend.

1799
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:43,060
Thank you.

1800
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:48,000
Oh, oh, okay.

1801
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:49,220
I was not talking to you.

1802
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:50,740
How's your day going?

1803
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:52,460
Who are you?

1804
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:54,480
I'm Sydney.

1805
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:56,240
Look, Sydney.

1806
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:59,040
We're just here to enjoy our pizza in peace.

1807
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:00,320
Thanks for understanding.

1808
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,600
You weren't here this morning for coffee break.

1809
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,560
Oh, talk to all people.

1810
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:06,280
All NPCs in the pizzeria.

1811
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,360
I didn't talk to this guy, though.

1812
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:10,960
Do you have any recommendations?

1813
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:13,240
Get the cheese.

1814
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,660
Just the cheese.

1815
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:17,520
Okay.

1816
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,320
This guy is going everywhere.

1817
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:19,940
He does not.

1818
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,180
It does not matter where he.

1819
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,000
Oh, my God.

1820
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:25,600
Oh.

1821
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:26,220
Oh.

1822
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:28,840
What are you doing?

1823
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,420
This guy is so short.

1824
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,500
Are you lost, little kid?

1825
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:47,200
What do you want?

1826
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:47,740
Stop!

1827
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:51,380
He's trying to fight me for real.

1828
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:59,020
Another Tokyo map stream.

1829
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:00,180
Going to Japan in November.

1830
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:01,300
Wanted to know some recommendations.

1831
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:03,860
Oh, I've only done Akiba before.

1832
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:05,800
I don't know where else I could...

1833
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,640
I don't know so many other places as well as...

1834
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,120
Oh, who's that?

1835
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:10,680
As well as I know...

1836
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:11,840
No!

1837
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,700
As well as I know Akiba.

1838
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,340
Walked up to a girl wearing an MGS2 shirt.

1839
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:17,280
Asked if she liked the game.

1840
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:17,880
She was confused.

1841
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:19,580
Then said she doesn't know him.

1842
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,100
She just likes the shirt.

1843
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:24,200
Glad people like Yoji, but I want to die after that L.

1844
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,980
No way!

1845
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,700
That is such an L.

1846
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:31,240
You should have told her to play at No 2.

1847
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:33,380
Actually, it was crazy.

1848
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:39,360
I would see Metal Gear shirts all the time in Japan.

1849
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,540
Like the Uniqlo ones.

1850
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,740
I saw them everywhere.

1851
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:44,560
It was kind of crazy actually.

1852
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:48,160
It was a lot of the ones...

1853
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:50,260
The one from Peace Walker.

1854
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:52,120
With them wearing the boxes on the head.

1855
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:53,640
And a lot of the Raiden ones.

1856
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:56,480
Like the Metal Gear Rising one.

1857
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:57,240
With Raiden.

1858
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,420
It was the Uniqlo one too.

1859
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:01,220
No!

1860
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:04,820
Oh, it hurts.

1861
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:05,680
Oh, it hurts!

1862
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,720
I kind of want to see if this guy opens the door back up.

1863
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:10,440
If we can go in.

1864
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:17,820
What are these?

1865
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:20,380
Oh, sorry.

1866
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:20,700
My bad.

1867
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:29,180
I know.

1868
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:31,220
We are going to continue the game in like 2 seconds.

1869
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:32,940
What does this say?

1870
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:36,520
I hope you are not doing these crosswords on the job.

1871
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:38,180
I hope you are not doing these crosswords on the job.

1872
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,420
Oh, I am so close.

1873
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:42,320
I am so close.

1874
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:44,020
Let me in.

1875
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:44,420
Let me in.

1876
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:45,240
Push me in.

1877
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:45,640
Push me in.

1878
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:47,620
Come on.

1879
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:47,940
Come on.

1880
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:54,980
Too bad.

1881
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:06,620
Oh, wait.

1882
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:07,600
I hate those things.

1883
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,740
I should have read the sign before I ordered that.

1884
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,400
Mike, what are you doing?

1885
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:17,880
Mike?

1886
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,380
It smells so good in here.

1887
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:30,360
We'll join in with him so he doesn't feel so self-conscious.

1888
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:31,120
Oh!

1889
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:33,580
A voice message.

1890
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,980
You guys are going to hate me.

1891
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,780
I swear I'll get on the road as soon as I can.

1892
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:42,180
I swear I'll get on the road as soon as I can.

1893
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:43,720
But something last minute popped up.

1894
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,520
I'm not going to bore you with all of the details.

1895
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:49,040
The long and short of it is one of my clients needs a last minute change.

1896
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:50,380
The long and short of it is one of my clients needs a last minute change.

1897
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,780
This is the only thing keeping the lights on.

1898
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,560
I hate to leave so late.

1899
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:56,000
But I gotta keep them happy.

1900
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:56,360
Oh, no.

1901
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:59,220
I'll have this logo done before you know it.

1902
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,540
And be on my way.

1903
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,980
I'm so sorry, you guys.

1904
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,080
Nora.

1905
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,060
Sad, sad, sad.

1906
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:06,480
Be careful.

1907
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,000
I hate that you're leaving so late.

1908
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,160
Drive slow and don't worry.

1909
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,520
I'll make sure Harp stays up to let you in.

1910
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:15,360
Why don't you stay up?

1911
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:16,960
What?

1912
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:16,980
What?

1913
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:22,220
Did you listen to Nora's voice message in the group?

1914
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:23,520
Yeah, I just saw.

1915
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:25,280
Looks like she'll be late.

1916
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,820
I guess we'll have to start the fun without her.

1917
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:31,380
Cheap.

1918
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:31,720
Safe.

1919
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,600
Oh, order number 27.

1920
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,440
You folks are right here.

1921
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,040
You gonna get that?

1922
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,660
Mike, be a gentleman.

1923
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,520
And go fetch our food for us.

1924
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:50,260
I swear.

1925
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:51,700
I'm messing all this up.

1926
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,420
Oh, now you get up?

1927
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,000
You're just getting your own?

1928
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:57,120
Mike, you're so selfish.

1929
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,580
Don't stare at me while you eat.

1930
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:04,660
Alright, you folks are all set.

1931
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,040
Thank you.

1932
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,940
I just can't with this guy.

1933
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:12,760
He's fumbling everything.

1934
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,720
Let's try...

1935
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:19,680
Oh, God.

1936
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:23,660
Oh, damn.

1937
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:25,140
This pizza slaps.

1938
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,480
I can't believe Nora is missing out on this bomb-ass pizza.

1939
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:31,440
Shut up.

1940
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:33,300
I'm mad at you right now.

1941
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:34,560
Oh, God.

1942
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,300
Can I mute it when this happens?

1943
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:41,590
Yeah.

1944
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:43,050
Nom, nom, nom, nom.

1945
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:45,670
Nom, nom, nom, nom.

1946
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:48,190
Nom, nom, nom, nom.

1947
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:52,670
Nom, nom, nom, nom.

1948
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:54,170
Nom, nom, nom, nom.

1949
01:21:57,610 --> 01:21:58,730
He's eating it up.

1950
01:21:58,790 --> 01:21:59,450
He's eating it up.

1951
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:02,610
Nom, nom, nom, nom.

1952
01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:04,330
Nom, nom, nom, nom.

1953
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:05,170
Oh.

1954
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:05,850
Oh.

1955
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:10,110
Hey there, my friends.

1956
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:11,630
Hello there.

1957
01:22:11,950 --> 01:22:15,270
I saw y'all pull in driving that nice old truck.

1958
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:18,690
Are you just watching who pulls in and taking notes?

1959
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:19,370
Gosh.

1960
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:20,950
Okay, Sydney.

1961
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:21,590
That's right.

1962
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:26,790
Not to be a bother or anything, but I was heading down the road myself.

1963
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:31,630
Seems like we might have been going the same direction.

1964
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:36,410
Y'all mind if I hitch a ride with you?

1965
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,210
Where's your car?

1966
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:45,570
Who needs a car when there are fine friends like you to pass the time with?

1967
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:45,930
Oh.

1968
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:46,170
Oh.

1969
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:48,750
Okay.

1970
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:51,790
Y'all wouldn't even know I was there.

1971
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:53,390
Quiet as a church mouse.

1972
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:54,750
And twice as nice.

1973
01:22:56,190 --> 01:22:57,010
So what do you say?

1974
01:22:57,130 --> 01:23:00,030
Care to give this free spirit a ride down that snowy road?

1975
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:01,590
Um.

1976
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:04,590
It's not my car.

1977
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:05,850
Sure, you can come with us.

1978
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:08,910
Oh.

1979
01:23:09,170 --> 01:23:10,310
Oh, but okay.

1980
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:12,650
You were making all the decisions tonight, Mike.

1981
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:15,250
But as soon as I make a decision, you have to say something?

1982
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:16,690
Huh?

1983
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:18,730
Hold on a second.

1984
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:20,810
Don't you think we need to discuss this?

1985
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:24,750
Isn't that what we're doing?

1986
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:27,950
I'm not sure if we have extra space for another passenger.

1987
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:34,130
Yeah.

1988
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:35,630
Oh, oh, oh.

1989
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:41,390
You know, you were fine with deciding that we didn't want drinks and deciding that we wanted three slices of pizza.

1990
01:23:42,170 --> 01:23:42,590
Right?

1991
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:44,550
And deciding that I get to pay for the pizza?

1992
01:23:44,970 --> 01:23:45,390
Michael?

1993
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:50,070
But as soon as I make a decision that I want to do something...

1994
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:50,910
Oh, oh, what?

1995
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:52,130
Shouldn't we talk about this?

1996
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:52,750
Oh my gosh, Joy!

1997
01:23:53,870 --> 01:23:54,930
Thank you for the hug!

1998
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:55,730
Thank you!

1999
01:23:55,970 --> 01:23:56,930
Thank you so much!

2000
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:01,010
I'm sorry, Minto.

2001
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:02,270
Oh, not you, Michael.

2002
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:03,570
Not you.

2003
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:04,190
Never you.

2004
01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:06,050
Never you.

2005
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:10,950
Oh, he's right.

2006
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:12,330
Only two seats in the truck.

2007
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:15,130
Surely you can find just a little bit of room for me.

2008
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:16,390
I can ride in the middle.

2009
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:18,330
Hell, I'll even ride in the bed.

2010
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:21,910
Aw, it's my friend's car.

2011
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:22,490
I'm sorry.

2012
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:25,330
We would give you a ride, but there isn't any space.

2013
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:27,230
You gotta be shitting me, lady.

2014
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:28,890
No space?

2015
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:30,810
I know there's a middle seat.

2016
01:24:30,990 --> 01:24:32,170
You scared of me or something?

2017
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,600
You ain't too kind, are you?

2018
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,040
Unkind people meet unkindness themselves.

2019
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:44,460
You best be careful out there.

2020
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:50,340
Are you threatening us?

2021
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:51,440
Yeah, get him, Mike.

2022
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:51,900
Get him.

2023
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:53,380
No, no, no!

2024
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:54,640
Y'all got me all wrong.

2025
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:56,880
Sorry, I'm just cold and tired is all.

2026
01:24:58,860 --> 01:24:59,340
Yeah.

2027
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:00,580
Thanks.

2028
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:03,780
That was weird.

2029
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:05,860
Look, Mike.

2030
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:10,180
We almost got killed because of your unkindness.

2031
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:11,000
We almost got killed because of your unkindness.

2032
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:11,480
Are you serious?

2033
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:14,540
How are you gonna let a stranger ride with us in the middle out of nowhere?

2034
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:16,280
How are you gonna let a stranger ride with us in the middle out of nowhere?

2035
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:18,740
I was just trying to help.

2036
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:20,260
Yeah.

2037
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:22,380
Well, sometimes helping can put you in a bad situation.

2038
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,540
What's up with your head, guy?

2039
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:26,740
You're starting to freak me out a little bit, Mike.

2040
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:28,820
Why is your head glitching like that?

2041
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,980
I think Mike is possessed.

2042
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:34,160
Alright, dad.

2043
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:35,740
Gosh.

2044
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,720
Back to chomp now.

2045
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:46,040
Damn, Harp.

2046
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:47,240
The crust?

2047
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:49,400
What?

2048
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:51,700
That's like the best part.

2049
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:55,420
What?

2050
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,400
What's wrong with eating the crust?

2051
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:03,690
It's kind of wasteful that too, don't you think?

2052
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:07,550
I guess, but you wouldn't really eat the peel of an orange, would you?

2053
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:10,530
That's not the same thing at all!

2054
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:14,790
Mike!

2055
01:26:16,290 --> 01:26:16,810
What?

2056
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:21,630
Meow meow meow meow meow Meow meow meow meow meow

2057
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,000
Pizza's made of crust!

2058
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:32,140
Yeah, when you eat an orange, you're not eating... like the whole peel is not involved!

2059
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:34,640
Mike is kind of insane.

2060
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:39,580
Meow meow meow meow Meow meow yum

2061
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:45,320
Oh, thank you!

2062
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:46,480
Oh my gosh, I wouldn't have heard that.

2063
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:47,440
Try for just thank you.

2064
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:48,780
10 out of 10 pizza ASMR.

2065
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:52,560
I can right mouse button to burp.

2066
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:53,100
Ugh.

2067
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:54,720
Oh my gosh.

2068
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,860
A burp so loud, even Nora heard it.

2069
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:00,260
Ugh.

2070
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:02,200
Oh my god, Sydney!

2071
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:08,000
Real fear is the Mike we fathomed on the way.

2072
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:15,680
Mike, you have no room to be judgemental here.

2073
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:16,980
What is this?

2074
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:20,740
You have no room to be judgemental.

2075
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:22,660
That was me enjoying my crust.

2076
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,300
Drive slow and don't... oh yeah.

2077
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,040
Heart XD heart!

2078
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,460
He doesn't want a real woman.

2079
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:33,900
He's like...

2080
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:38,400
He's like, oh my gosh, I used to be so in love with Sydney during our college days.

2081
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:39,280
You know what?

2082
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:40,500
I think this trip...

2083
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:44,380
Oh my god, the grandpa behind him looks like an evil demon.

2084
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:45,920
Like in some... look at him!

2085
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:47,620
Doesn't he look evil?

2086
01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:53,590
Holy cow.

2087
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:58,430
He's like, oh my gosh, I've always been in love with Sydney.

2088
01:27:58,530 --> 01:28:04,150
She was always so delicate and wonderful and kind and smart and beautiful in college.

2089
01:28:04,330 --> 01:28:09,290
She probably grew up to be like the most reliable, awesome person ever.

2090
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:13,350
Little does he know.

2091
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,450
Oh my god.

2092
01:28:17,570 --> 01:28:18,370
Oh gosh.

2093
01:28:18,530 --> 01:28:19,190
We're so close.

2094
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:20,390
Holy...

2095
01:28:20,530 --> 01:28:21,110
That was good!

2096
01:28:22,350 --> 01:28:22,790
Joy!

2097
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:24,370
Look at the bamboo ship!

2098
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:25,110
Thank you!

2099
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:27,230
Alright then.

2100
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:28,310
Are you ready to hit the road?

2101
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:30,190
Maybe we can beat the worst of the snow.

2102
01:28:31,030 --> 01:28:31,930
Give me the keys.

2103
01:28:33,390 --> 01:28:34,630
Harp, the weather is awful.

2104
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:36,990
Why don't you drive part of the way home?

2105
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:39,850
Take a break while I drive.

2106
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:41,870
Michael...

2107
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:49,230
This guy is moaning and groaning behind you.

2108
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:58,070
Michael, I think you're being violated right in front of this guy.

2109
01:28:58,990 --> 01:28:59,970
What is happening?

2110
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:03,410
Why is Michael in quotation marks?

2111
01:29:04,510 --> 01:29:07,350
I'm afraid of what kind of break you're going to give me, Harp.

2112
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:11,610
You'll be afraid if you don't give me the keys.

2113
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:18,470
What is happening?

2114
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:18,570
What is happening?

2115
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:29,260
Oh my

2116
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:37,680
gosh, we need to get out of here.

2117
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:39,300
Fine, but there's one condition.

2118
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,440
What is it?

2119
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:44,640
I get first choice of bedrooms when or if we get there.

2120
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:45,840
Whatever.

2121
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,440
It's time for Minto to drive.

2122
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,040
He's been freed.

2123
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:53,740
Y'all drive safe.

2124
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:56,080
Yeah, I'm going to take over the wheel.

2125
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:57,700
You're going to what?

2126
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,480
Why is it so loud all of a sudden?

2127
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:09,540
We could have gotten a water.

2128
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:12,640
Come on, let's go.

2129
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,980
Bro is enjoying that Zod too much.

2130
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:19,480
Andragos, thank you for the 20 gift.

2131
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:20,140
Thank you so much.

2132
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,240
Thank you, Paige, for the super jet.

2133
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:24,180
Pretty funny.

2134
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:28,560
He doesn't speak many words.

2135
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:31,800
Alright, let's go.

2136
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:38,000
Oh, gosh.

2137
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:39,980
That was like the longest detour ever.

2138
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:42,680
You ready for me to drive?

2139
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:46,940
Where'd that guy go?

2140
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:47,980
He's not in the bed, is he?

2141
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:48,280
Okay.

2142
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,160
Here we go.

2143
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,080
Minto Drifto.

2144
01:30:58,240 --> 01:30:59,840
5.49 p.m.

2145
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:03,780
Good evening, Vermont.

2146
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:06,600
This is your host on WKWB.

2147
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:07,980
Your hometown station.

2148
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:11,120
Bringing you the best tunes to warm your hearts on this chilly night.

2149
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:17,140
As we embrace the first snowfall of the season, there's nothing like a perfect song to set the mood.

2150
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:20,180
So here's a track that'll make you feel right at home.

2151
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:20,380
Beep.

2152
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:21,180
Beep.

2153
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:21,380
Beep.

2154
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:23,640
Beep.

2155
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:25,040
Well.

2156
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,400
Oh my gosh.

2157
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:30,900
This is like, giving me a real Christmas vibe, right?

2158
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:32,640
It's pretty nice, actually.

2159
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:35,340
Ghost Behind the Wheel?

2160
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:36,340
Yeah.

2161
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:39,080
What?

2162
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,760
That's one way to take the scenic route.

2163
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:48,780
Sorry.

2164
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:49,020
Hi!

2165
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,540
I was out of practice with the drivers.

2166
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:58,280
I'm trying to get on the side of the road!

2167
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:06,900
This song kind of slaps.

2168
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:13,280
25 miles per hour!

2169
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,300
What about 250 miles per hour?

2170
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:19,540
Wait, which way do I go?

2171
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:20,900
Oh.

2172
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:22,940
Which is this way?

2173
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:27,060
That's Woodbury, but...

2174
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:29,660
Why don't we go this way?

2175
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,360
We missed the turn at first.

2176
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:37,700
I see.

2177
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:40,360
I see what?

2178
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:44,400
Joy, thanks for the 50 gift cards!

2179
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,200
Thank you!

2180
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:46,320
Uh-oh.

2181
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:48,700
Uh-oh.

2182
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:49,860
The car is stalling.

2183
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:50,780
Uh-oh!

2184
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:53,760
Oh gosh!

2185
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,120
The car is stalling!

2186
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:55,740
We can't make it!

2187
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:02,180
I hope this isn't copyrighted.

2188
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:02,440
It's not!

2189
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:08,680
At the beginning, when I opened the game, it said that all the music is copyright-free.

2190
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:11,740
So, we should be okay.

2191
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:12,520
Hopefully.

2192
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:14,460
Come on, car!

2193
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:17,320
I just spent a year alone and never missed a soul.

2194
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:17,840
Yay!

2195
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:20,960
I could try my hardest and I'll never reach my goals.

2196
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:24,280
I know that I'll need more love inside my heart.

2197
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:25,220
What is here?

2198
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:26,060
Oh my gosh.

2199
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:27,560
Why are we going so slow, actually?

2200
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:30,480
We should be getting pretty close.

2201
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:31,880
Do you remember the address?

2202
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:35,040
I think the address was 241 Woodbury Boulevard.

2203
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:36,400
Wait.

2204
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:42,250
Okay, I think we're good now.

2205
01:33:45,150 --> 01:33:48,190
I see one crazy driver.

2206
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:51,630
Oh!

2207
01:33:51,990 --> 01:33:52,550
Hello!

2208
01:33:56,930 --> 01:33:58,870
It was a very cold night.

2209
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:00,810
Why are we getting out here, Harp?

2210
01:34:03,630 --> 01:34:05,390
Actually, there's an invisible wall.

2211
01:34:07,330 --> 01:34:08,650
He's just following me.

2212
01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:10,770
Like a little puppy.

2213
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:13,370
Okay, we'll turn around.

2214
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:20,030
Got to talk to my actual boss about keeping my job soon.

2215
01:34:20,210 --> 01:34:21,550
So, I'm glad I could catch the stream.

2216
01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:22,330
Oh!

2217
01:34:22,470 --> 01:34:22,990
Good luck!

2218
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:27,310
You are a value to your company.

2219
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:30,230
Oh!

2220
01:34:30,710 --> 01:34:31,530
Harp, are you okay?

2221
01:34:31,690 --> 01:34:32,450
Do you want me to take over?

2222
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:33,570
Says nothing.

2223
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:36,770
I crashed by a truck.

2224
01:34:37,430 --> 01:34:38,410
Okay, it's really loud.

2225
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:40,490
Today is a good time to start.

2226
01:34:44,070 --> 01:34:44,510
Oh, it's a little bit cold.

2227
01:34:45,370 --> 01:34:46,890
Back up the hill we go!

2228
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:50,430
This is what happens when you go off the beaten path, I guess.

2229
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:52,570
Oh, my lights are flashing.

2230
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:54,270
The car is really breaking down.

2231
01:34:57,670 --> 01:34:58,110
Okay!

2232
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:02,390
Shut up, please.

2233
01:35:04,650 --> 01:35:05,090
Alright.

2234
01:35:05,290 --> 01:35:05,950
Here we go.

2235
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:11,530
You'll be running up the hill, running up the road.

2236
01:35:13,110 --> 01:35:16,130
Something, I'm trying to get to Woodbury.

2237
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:21,230
I think we are almost there.

2238
01:35:23,310 --> 01:35:24,690
You got your license?

2239
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:25,910
Yeah.

2240
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:28,530
I'm licensed to kill.

2241
01:35:28,670 --> 01:35:29,630
Why is it so slow?

2242
01:35:30,990 --> 01:35:32,590
Did I really break the car?

2243
01:35:33,790 --> 01:35:35,010
Oh, come on.

2244
01:35:35,490 --> 01:35:36,770
Why is it so slow?

2245
01:35:50,690 --> 01:35:52,650
Yeah, do a little squirt, squirt.

2246
01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:57,030
Squirt, squirt.

2247
01:35:58,970 --> 01:36:00,030
Which way is it?

2248
01:36:02,170 --> 01:36:03,050
241, right?

2249
01:36:03,670 --> 01:36:04,150
Slow.

2250
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:05,810
I don't think so.

2251
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:07,830
I've been going slow this whole time.

2252
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:12,250
Did I put it back on?

2253
01:36:12,990 --> 01:36:14,090
Look at that bobblehead.

2254
01:36:18,030 --> 01:36:18,650
We're here!

2255
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:21,230
Hold on!

2256
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:23,230
Hold on!

2257
01:36:26,210 --> 01:36:28,670
I told you, driving in the snow is no joke.

2258
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:29,370
This guy!

2259
01:36:29,730 --> 01:36:30,630
It wasn't me!

2260
01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:33,270
I should have just let Mike drive.

2261
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:35,830
I'm trying!

2262
01:36:35,830 --> 01:36:37,750
They're the one who ran into me!

2263
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:40,830
Okay, the music is distracting me, you guys.

2264
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:42,090
It's the music's fault.

2265
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:47,850
Okay, 241.

2266
01:36:48,910 --> 01:36:50,490
This looks kind of industrial.

2267
01:36:50,670 --> 01:36:51,630
This doesn't look like a neighborhood.

2268
01:36:52,350 --> 01:36:54,850
We're gonna be there any minute now.

2269
01:36:55,650 --> 01:36:56,170
Right?

2270
01:36:57,150 --> 01:36:58,310
Should be getting close.

2271
01:37:00,330 --> 01:37:01,430
241 Woodbury.

2272
01:37:01,710 --> 01:37:01,950
Oh.

2273
01:37:03,810 --> 01:37:04,630
That's a cop.

2274
01:37:04,630 --> 01:37:05,450
Okay.

2275
01:37:05,770 --> 01:37:06,630
Act natural.

2276
01:37:06,710 --> 01:37:07,030
Act natural.

2277
01:37:07,170 --> 01:37:08,550
The real horror was Minto's driving.

2278
01:37:08,690 --> 01:37:10,210
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2279
01:37:11,890 --> 01:37:13,010
Shackled by lust?

2280
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:14,830
Jesus, that's free!

2281
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:16,030
Wait!

2282
01:37:18,210 --> 01:37:19,090
I saw...

2283
01:37:19,090 --> 01:37:21,810
I saw a sign almost just like this in California.

2284
01:37:23,050 --> 01:37:23,490
Joy!

2285
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:24,710
Thank you for the 50!

2286
01:37:25,450 --> 01:37:26,710
Such a rude driver.

2287
01:37:26,850 --> 01:37:26,970
No!

2288
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:28,010
No!

2289
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:28,830
I saw...

2290
01:37:28,830 --> 01:37:29,130
Hold on.

2291
01:37:30,130 --> 01:37:31,410
I have a photo of it.

2292
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:32,290
I took a picture of it.

2293
01:37:32,290 --> 01:37:33,050
Cause I was like, whoa!

2294
01:37:33,910 --> 01:37:35,570
It was a photo just like this.

2295
01:37:35,970 --> 01:37:36,890
When I went to...

2296
01:37:38,410 --> 01:37:39,530
When I went to AX.

2297
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:40,430
Hold on.

2298
01:37:41,370 --> 01:37:41,890
Hold on.

2299
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:42,450
I got it.

2300
01:37:44,990 --> 01:37:45,590
Hold on.

2301
01:37:45,690 --> 01:37:46,550
I have it.

2302
01:37:47,290 --> 01:37:47,790
Hold on.

2303
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:48,330
That's off-key.

2304
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:49,490
Wait.

2305
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:51,170
When was AX?

2306
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:52,270
Yes.

2307
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:52,690
Okay.

2308
01:37:53,570 --> 01:37:54,610
It said... Hold on.

2309
01:37:54,690 --> 01:37:55,370
I got it.

2310
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:57,150
It said... Hold on.

2311
01:37:57,210 --> 01:37:57,730
I have it.

2312
01:37:57,770 --> 01:37:58,090
Hold on.

2313
01:37:59,870 --> 01:38:00,730
Where is it?

2314
01:38:00,770 --> 01:38:00,930
Oh!

2315
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:01,630
It said...

2316
01:38:02,290 --> 01:38:03,310
Stop your OnlyFans.

2317
01:38:03,470 --> 01:38:04,890
Stop simping.

2318
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:07,690
Save our families and communities.

2319
01:38:08,230 --> 01:38:09,650
Paid for by...

2320
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:10,730
No simps.

2321
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:14,650
Wait.

2322
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:16,810
Which way is it?

2323
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:18,510
Which way is it?

2324
01:38:21,190 --> 01:38:22,550
This way?

2325
01:38:23,210 --> 01:38:23,890
Probably.

2326
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:30,540
Paid for by no simps.

2327
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:32,720
I don't want no simps.

2328
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:34,280
A simp is a guy who has...

2329
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:35,680
Onlyfans.

2330
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:38,000
Thanks for the combo.

2331
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:40,020
It should be shackled by lust.

2332
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,140
Jesus sets... free?

2333
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:43,060
What?

2334
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:45,020
Which way is it?

2335
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:47,020
I don't know.

2336
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:49,080
Oh!

2337
01:38:49,180 --> 01:38:50,680
I drove past our cabin at first.

2338
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:51,040
I did?

2339
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:53,260
Is it this way?

2340
01:38:56,820 --> 01:38:57,460
This way?

2341
01:39:01,670 --> 01:39:02,750
How can I tell?

2342
01:39:04,570 --> 01:39:04,930
Wait.

2343
01:39:05,050 --> 01:39:05,130
What?

2344
01:39:06,070 --> 01:39:07,110
Am I going the right way?

2345
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:10,350
Beep.

2346
01:39:11,410 --> 01:39:11,770
Beep.

2347
01:39:12,210 --> 01:39:12,570
Beep.

2348
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:15,510
Behind me.

2349
01:39:17,810 --> 01:39:19,010
He told us the address.

2350
01:39:19,110 --> 01:39:20,230
I wish he would say like...

2351
01:39:20,230 --> 01:39:21,250
Stop here.

2352
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:23,670
Oh!

2353
01:39:23,690 --> 01:39:24,330
There it is.

2354
01:39:24,430 --> 01:39:24,770
There it is.

2355
01:39:25,610 --> 01:39:26,330
Right here.

2356
01:39:26,670 --> 01:39:31,320
We are here.

2357
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:32,220
This should be it.

2358
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:32,760
Hahaha.

2359
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:36,520
I should have just let Mike drive.

2360
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:37,320
Hahaha.

2361
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,800
I thought you were just going to keep driving there.

2362
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:45,040
Alright.

2363
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:47,660
We are here.

2364
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:49,000
Oh!

2365
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:50,360
It was a quaint little house...

2366
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:51,260
in a quiet neighborhood.

2367
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:54,080
Is that...

2368
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:54,860
boarded up?

2369
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:55,140
Why?

2370
01:39:55,420 --> 01:39:55,980
What is that?

2371
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:56,780
Oh!

2372
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:57,220
Oh yeah!

2373
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:57,820
Let's get our stuff.

2374
01:40:02,690 --> 01:40:03,430
My things.

2375
01:40:07,890 --> 01:40:08,730
Open the door.

2376
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:09,850
Oh!

2377
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:10,570
The door was locked.

2378
01:40:10,670 --> 01:40:11,830
I had to get the key from the lockbox.

2379
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:13,210
Oh!

2380
01:40:13,530 --> 01:40:14,250
What was it?

2381
01:40:16,030 --> 01:40:16,830
It was...

2382
01:40:18,090 --> 01:40:18,490
5176.

2383
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:25,840
One.

2384
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:27,180
Seven.

2385
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:28,200
Six.

2386
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:30,280
Yeah!

2387
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:33,240
Perfect.

2388
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:34,820
Don't forget to check in.

2389
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:35,340
Yeah, I know.

2390
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:35,500
Oh!

2391
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:37,440
Here!

2392
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:45,680
Ready?

2393
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:47,640
My back hurts.

2394
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:48,640
Hahaha.

2395
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:52,900
Do we need to get you to the nursing home, old man?

2396
01:40:53,420 --> 01:40:54,240
Let's go in.

2397
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:55,460
I really need to.

2398
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,020
Let's just hurry up, Harp.

2399
01:40:58,080 --> 01:40:58,400
What?

2400
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:59,640
The nursing home?

2401
01:41:01,220 --> 01:41:03,680
I'd like to place a delivery order for I.C.

2402
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:04,460
Wiener.

2403
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,120
Hahaha.

2404
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,120
Go on in!

2405
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:10,580
What is this part though?

2406
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:11,800
Why is it boarded up right here?

2407
01:41:14,300 --> 01:41:15,200
Why is this...

2408
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:16,140
This place is kind of...

2409
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:17,200
dumpy, isn't it?

2410
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:21,940
Why is the music so scary?

2411
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:25,180
Oh!

2412
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:26,100
What a great place!

2413
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,520
I knew we could count on you!

2414
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:29,500
It smells so nice in here.

2415
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:30,580
Right?

2416
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:32,140
But I really need to hit the john.

2417
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:33,360
Take your time!

2418
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:36,700
While I'm gone, can you put these groceries away?

2419
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:38,280
There should be enough space in the fridge.

2420
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:39,020
Sure.

2421
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:43,140
Checked in.

2422
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:43,900
Entered the cabin.

2423
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:46,240
The house was cozy and well furnished.

2424
01:41:48,180 --> 01:41:48,700
Alright.

2425
01:41:49,740 --> 01:41:51,720
The music does not match the dialogue.

2426
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:52,400
Yeah, I'm scared.

2427
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,080
Okay.

2428
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:56,060
What do we got in here?

2429
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,080
We got yogurt.

2430
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:02,640
We got...

2431
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:06,100
Apples?

2432
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:08,680
We got...

2433
01:42:09,700 --> 01:42:10,220
Milk.

2434
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:13,900
We got...

2435
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:14,760
We got...

2436
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:15,200
Milk again.

2437
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:19,040
That one actually worked.

2438
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:20,560
We got...

2439
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:21,260
Eggs.

2440
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:25,680
We got...

2441
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:28,320
Had to close the mini fridge before picking it up.

2442
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:30,240
How do I close it?

2443
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:30,640
Oh.

2444
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:33,280
What was that?

2445
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:36,600
Excuse me.

2446
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:37,300
I'm trying to...

2447
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:39,540
I'm trying to open this.

2448
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:41,620
Oh, there we go.

2449
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:43,260
We've got turkey.

2450
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:46,480
We've got...

2451
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:47,380
Bell peppers.

2452
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:49,580
Joint!

2453
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:51,380
Oh my gosh!

2454
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:52,520
Thank you for another 50!

2455
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:53,240
What is happening?

2456
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:55,100
Thank you!

2457
01:42:57,580 --> 01:42:58,460
We've got...

2458
01:42:58,460 --> 01:42:58,900
Lettuce.

2459
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:04,640
Okay.

2460
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:07,640
How do I get this in the fridge?

2461
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:09,820
Oh!

2462
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:10,860
I just have to...

2463
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:10,940
Oops.

2464
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:11,580
Oh.

2465
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:13,380
Wait.

2466
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:15,900
Hold on.

2467
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:16,380
Stop.

2468
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:18,640
Let's stop it, please.

2469
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,220
I didn't need to throw it at all.

2470
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:27,600
There we go.

2471
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:31,720
All good!

2472
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:37,500
Oh my god!

2473
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,380
Sorry about that harp.

2474
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:42,920
You had to use the bathroom.

2475
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:43,900
What's the issue?

2476
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:45,680
Also, I see you there.

2477
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:46,760
No simps for Minto.

2478
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:49,100
Shackled by this mortal coil of existence.

2479
01:43:49,460 --> 01:43:50,380
Live no more.

2480
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:51,060
Minto drives.

2481
01:43:52,580 --> 01:43:53,540
TV tables dry!

2482
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:54,360
Thank you for the 20.

2483
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:54,600
I'm dead!

2484
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:56,760
Are you okay?

2485
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,980
Long drive and all that pizza really did a number on me.

2486
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:01,160
Hang on.

2487
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:02,180
I really need to pee.

2488
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:03,700
You can go ahead.

2489
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,220
I'll start unpacking our bags.

2490
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:06,920
You're gonna go through my stuff?

2491
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:08,580
Thanks.

2492
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:10,780
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2493
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:11,860
I have underwear in there.

2494
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:12,120
Oh!

2495
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:13,880
No, no, no!

2496
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:14,300
No, no, no!

2497
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:16,340
No!

2498
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:16,920
You freak!

2499
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:18,500
You freak, you freak, you freak.

2500
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:19,700
I had to pee.

2501
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:29,440
Is that him opening the doors?

2502
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:31,420
Can we close this?

2503
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:32,400
Oh, no, no, no.

2504
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:37,720
I'm scared.

2505
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:40,560
The smell alone told me pizza had really done a number on me.

2506
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:41,220
This is disgusting.

2507
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:42,860
I don't need to know this.

2508
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:44,800
Come on!

2509
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:45,940
Game!

2510
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:50,640
We have the pee meter again.

2511
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,400
Escape to text Rick.

2512
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,780
Okay, this is the most realistic thing now.

2513
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:56,180
Oh.

2514
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:58,720
I thought it was gonna be like a...

2515
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:00,160
Hi, we've checked in.

2516
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,740
I thought it was gonna be like one of those...

2517
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:03,220
What's it called?

2518
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:07,860
One of those like...

2519
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:10,620
I type it and it automatically puts in something.

2520
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:18,820
Oh, you can see through the blinds.

2521
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:21,620
Nothing but metal gear memorabilia in the back.

2522
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:24,960
See the crouch?

2523
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:27,440
Oh, gosh.

2524
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:28,500
It's gonna be one of these.

2525
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:29,580
Wash your hands.

2526
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:32,520
Guys, I'm not actually peeing.

2527
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:33,020
Stop it.

2528
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:38,260
Whose leftover stuff is this?

2529
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:40,600
Why is it so dark in here?

2530
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:41,460
Dry your hands.

2531
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:43,020
Okay.

2532
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:46,820
Oh my god!

2533
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:47,340
Jesus!

2534
01:45:52,890 --> 01:45:53,970
Oh my god!

2535
01:45:58,200 --> 01:45:59,760
You're scaring me so much!

2536
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:01,820
You feeling better after the drive?

2537
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:03,660
Much better now.

2538
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:04,980
So, oh!

2539
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:06,820
This is the most movement we've seen him done.

2540
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:08,360
Ready to check out the place?

2541
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:10,900
Sure, let's see what this place has to offer.

2542
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:12,320
After you.

2543
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:15,080
Okay.

2544
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:16,580
Crosswords.

2545
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:18,900
And the fire is already going.

2546
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:24,480
This living room is bigger than my apartment.

2547
01:46:26,940 --> 01:46:28,300
Aren't you like a programmer?

2548
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:32,060
Wow, nice TV.

2549
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:34,560
Isn't this like also the 90s or something?

2550
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:35,340
Like this TV is...

2551
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:37,220
They don't have flat screen.

2552
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:38,740
Who's that?

2553
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:42,820
Could've swept.

2554
01:46:42,820 --> 01:46:45,060
Before we came in.

2555
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:45,620
But alright.

2556
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:48,480
Oh my god!

2557
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:49,540
It's creeping me out!

2558
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:50,540
Oh!

2559
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,460
What is this?

2560
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:54,660
Ouija board!

2561
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:57,060
Play it!

2562
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,000
But they don't even empty the trash!

2563
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:01,740
Oh!

2564
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:04,120
90s didn't have smartphones and K-cups either.

2565
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:05,140
You're so right!

2566
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:06,560
How did you think about it?

2567
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:09,240
Nobody's out there, right?

2568
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:10,740
Why doesn't this room have blinds?

2569
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:13,340
Oh, sick dinosaur!

2570
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:17,380
Chess...

2571
01:47:20,790 --> 01:47:22,030
Whispers in the dark?

2572
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:24,150
The hell is that?

2573
01:47:25,490 --> 01:47:26,230
Excuse me.

2574
01:47:31,590 --> 01:47:32,570
What else we got?

2575
01:47:32,930 --> 01:47:34,510
We got the kitchen!

2576
01:47:37,590 --> 01:47:38,330
Hurry up!

2577
01:47:39,010 --> 01:47:39,850
Hurry up, Mikey!

2578
01:47:41,870 --> 01:47:42,910
Hurry up!

2579
01:47:43,230 --> 01:47:44,650
Can't wait to cook here later!

2580
01:47:45,150 --> 01:47:47,010
When did you start cooking?

2581
01:47:47,690 --> 01:47:48,950
Don't let Mike cook.

2582
01:47:49,210 --> 01:47:50,450
I'm full of surprises!

2583
01:47:51,070 --> 01:47:51,590
Weak!

2584
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:04,840
What's this door over here?

2585
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:08,040
Oh!

2586
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,660
You can go down there first.

2587
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:13,620
Let's go up...

2588
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:14,400
Let's go upstairs.

2589
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:17,620
Let's go upstairs.

2590
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:20,060
Unbiased vampire.

2591
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:20,700
Boy, thanks.

2592
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:21,820
Welcome to membership.

2593
01:48:21,860 --> 01:48:22,400
Thank you!

2594
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:24,360
Thanks for joining.

2595
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:27,260
Oh my gosh, Joy!

2596
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:28,600
Thank you for another 50!

2597
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:30,680
Thank you!

2598
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:32,360
Please, your wallet.

2599
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:33,980
Please, please, please, please, please, your wallet.

2600
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:38,680
Okay.

2601
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:40,920
We got a...

2602
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:42,800
Maybe we should take this as a weapon?

2603
01:48:44,300 --> 01:48:45,320
I'll take this for now.

2604
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:48,720
Okay.

2605
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:50,140
What else we got?

2606
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:50,320
Oh!

2607
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:53,060
Ah!

2608
01:48:53,740 --> 01:48:54,340
Ah!

2609
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:13,680
Oh hey, you're here!

2610
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:16,440
Who are you?

2611
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:16,840
Who are you?

2612
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:19,340
Welcome to my home sweet home!

2613
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:21,560
What a lovely young couple.

2614
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:22,580
No, no, no!

2615
01:49:22,700 --> 01:49:23,380
We're not a couple!

2616
01:49:33,550 --> 01:49:35,730
Mike took offense to that.

2617
01:49:36,170 --> 01:49:36,770
Oh!

2618
01:49:37,310 --> 01:49:39,730
You didn't have to sell it that hard, Harp.

2619
01:49:40,190 --> 01:49:42,230
I was just answering his question.

2620
01:49:42,670 --> 01:49:44,530
He didn't ask a question, Sydney.

2621
01:49:44,710 --> 01:49:46,310
He made a statement and you...

2622
01:49:47,270 --> 01:49:47,990
Never mind.

2623
01:49:49,610 --> 01:49:50,330
Oopsie daisy.

2624
01:49:50,410 --> 01:49:50,870
Silly me.

2625
01:49:50,970 --> 01:49:52,610
Didn't mean to cause a stir with you two.

2626
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:54,750
We didn't expect anyone to be here.

2627
01:49:55,770 --> 01:49:56,650
Oh, um...

2628
01:49:56,650 --> 01:50:01,470
I was out looking for my cat earlier and remembered the TV has been on the fritz here.

2629
01:50:02,290 --> 01:50:07,190
Just thought I'd stop by and try to get it working again since the last few folks left a bad word for it.

2630
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:12,030
You know, they say treat your guests like family.

2631
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:14,170
My family doesn't go without TV.

2632
01:50:17,630 --> 01:50:19,630
The dramatic turns back to Mikey.

2633
01:50:20,130 --> 01:50:25,370
Speaking of that, now that you folks are here, let me show you around my sweet home.

2634
01:50:27,550 --> 01:50:30,190
I'd be a bad owner if I didn't give you the grand tour.

2635
01:50:31,770 --> 01:50:32,250
Oh.

2636
01:50:34,170 --> 01:50:35,070
About the TV?

2637
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:38,630
My host was a middle-aged man with a nervous energy.

2638
01:50:40,490 --> 01:50:43,270
Right from the start, his presence made us uncomfortable.

2639
01:50:44,110 --> 01:50:46,270
This is why I don't do Airbnbs.

2640
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:49,070
This is exactly why I don't do Airbnbs.

2641
01:50:49,070 --> 01:50:51,470
Because sometimes the owner will just stay at the Airbnb.

2642
01:50:51,710 --> 01:50:53,290
It doesn't make any sense why that's allowed.

2643
01:50:54,210 --> 01:50:57,810
Singer Invader from Space reveals truth about nut allergies.

2644
01:51:00,310 --> 01:51:02,170
Bites Tiger attacking police.

2645
01:51:02,490 --> 01:51:02,930
Bites Tiger attacking police.

2646
01:51:02,930 --> 01:51:03,650
What's going on here?

2647
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:06,490
Why is there a toilet roll next to the couch?

2648
01:51:06,670 --> 01:51:06,810
Why is there a toilet roll next to the couch?

2649
01:51:06,810 --> 01:51:07,270
Oh my god!

2650
01:51:09,350 --> 01:51:10,010
What's here?

2651
01:51:10,970 --> 01:51:11,930
Here's your shower!

2652
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:16,590
That thing will make you feel like you're bathing under a waterfall in the Amazon jungle.

2653
01:51:17,950 --> 01:51:19,950
Oh, this sink doesn't work unfortunately.

2654
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:24,460
Not to worry.

2655
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:26,360
I'll get it fixed for you real soon.

2656
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:28,420
I've never been in one.

2657
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:29,040
Are they dangerous?

2658
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,340
What, an Airbnb?

2659
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:34,700
It's just that it's not as well regulated as a hotel is.

2660
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:36,440
Because...

2661
01:51:37,540 --> 01:51:43,620
Airbnb hosts can just walk in or they can put cameras in rooms and you don't realize it.

2662
01:51:45,580 --> 01:51:47,840
Let me show you the other bedroom now.

2663
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:54,520
Why is there no lights in here?

2664
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:56,080
Look, Harp!

2665
01:51:56,540 --> 01:51:58,300
This room has a nice ass!

2666
01:51:59,300 --> 01:51:59,740
View!

2667
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:09,900
You think that's nice, mister?

2668
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:12,260
Wait till I show you the deck.

2669
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:16,960
First the ass, now the deck?

2670
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:19,320
Follow me now, please.

2671
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:21,820
Wait, I want to see the view.

2672
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:26,480
Mikey, your standards.

2673
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:27,940
Are you coming, miss?

2674
01:52:31,340 --> 01:52:31,940
Yeah.

2675
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:33,020
Yeah.

2676
01:52:33,020 --> 01:52:33,380
I'm coming.

2677
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,080
Alright, let's go.

2678
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:37,460
I'm following along.

2679
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:40,640
A laundry room.

2680
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:42,480
Oh, nice!

2681
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:43,940
Wow, this is actually...

2682
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:45,660
Wow, this looks so nice!

2683
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:48,180
Holy smokes, this is incredible!

2684
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:49,860
Definitely.

2685
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:51,920
Glad you folks like it.

2686
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:54,040
This is one of my favorite spots.

2687
01:52:54,340 --> 01:52:56,060
The view of the creek is beautiful.

2688
01:52:56,780 --> 01:52:58,580
It's a great spot for fishing, too.

2689
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:00,340
Fishing!

2690
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:03,480
Alright, folks.

2691
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:06,000
Let's head back in before I catch the cold here again.

2692
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:07,840
Yeah, you don't even have a...

2693
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,100
You just have a t-shirt on.

2694
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:11,620
Like you're in Hawaii or something.

2695
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:13,660
Wow, this looks so nice!

2696
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:15,220
Oh, are you coming, miss?

2697
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:16,220
Hold on, hold on.

2698
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:17,720
It looks so nice!

2699
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:18,960
Where's the creek?

2700
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:20,060
What creek?

2701
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:22,060
There's a creek?

2702
01:53:23,340 --> 01:53:24,600
Do you guys see a creek?

2703
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:25,800
Am I crazy?

2704
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:27,560
Is it that over there?

2705
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:28,960
I can't tell at all.

2706
01:53:37,530 --> 01:53:38,050
Okay.

2707
01:53:38,690 --> 01:53:39,530
Storage closet.

2708
01:53:43,890 --> 01:53:45,250
It's probably frozen over.

2709
01:53:45,430 --> 01:53:45,830
Oh.

2710
01:53:49,070 --> 01:53:50,230
Here's the storage room.

2711
01:53:50,890 --> 01:53:53,470
Was looking for his cat, but isn't dressed for outside.

2712
01:53:53,690 --> 01:53:54,030
Sus.

2713
01:53:55,850 --> 01:53:56,570
You're right.

2714
01:53:57,630 --> 01:54:01,790
If you need anything, tools, extra blankets, what not, it's all in here.

2715
01:54:03,110 --> 01:54:07,570
If the power ever goes out, we can use this flashlight here on my right.

2716
01:54:08,230 --> 01:54:09,090
That's what I'm holding.

2717
01:54:09,370 --> 01:54:10,810
Storms like these, you never know.

2718
01:54:12,490 --> 01:54:13,670
We might not need it.

2719
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:14,590
Trust me.

2720
01:54:14,610 --> 01:54:16,370
It's always best to know where your light is.

2721
01:54:18,010 --> 01:54:18,690
Alright, folks.

2722
01:54:18,770 --> 01:54:19,890
Let's head downstairs now.

2723
01:54:20,230 --> 01:54:20,710
Shutting the door.

2724
01:54:23,790 --> 01:54:24,670
Me first.

2725
01:54:24,830 --> 01:54:25,630
I'm gonna beat Mikey.

2726
01:54:27,650 --> 01:54:28,530
Haha, slowpoke.

2727
01:54:28,770 --> 01:54:29,050
Haha.

2728
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:37,150
Alrighty, folks.

2729
01:54:37,250 --> 01:54:40,070
I see I already stocked up the fridge with some tasty food.

2730
01:54:40,610 --> 01:54:41,530
Yep, that's ours.

2731
01:54:42,110 --> 01:54:43,090
You see the knob?

2732
01:54:43,290 --> 01:54:46,090
Turn the knob for more cooling and down to cool it off.

2733
01:54:46,990 --> 01:54:48,830
I tend to keep it low in the winter.

2734
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:50,190
The bill gets out of control.

2735
01:54:51,590 --> 01:54:54,070
Speaking of winter, I better show you folks the water.

2736
01:54:54,090 --> 01:54:54,250
The water heater.

2737
01:54:55,730 --> 01:54:56,970
Is that in the basement?

2738
01:54:58,390 --> 01:54:59,690
Is that in the basement?

2739
01:55:03,650 --> 01:55:07,170
Okay, Mikey is just all powerful.

2740
01:55:07,450 --> 01:55:09,310
He can just go through any door he pleases.

2741
01:55:09,490 --> 01:55:09,990
Oh my gosh.

2742
01:55:10,210 --> 01:55:11,710
No access to guests.

2743
01:55:14,010 --> 01:55:15,530
I couldn't open the door.

2744
01:55:21,510 --> 01:55:23,370
Nothing to worry about down here.

2745
01:55:23,370 --> 01:55:25,670
Just the water heater and some old storage stuff.

2746
01:55:31,150 --> 01:55:31,630
Okay.

2747
01:55:31,630 --> 01:55:32,290
It's creepy.

2748
01:55:32,650 --> 01:55:35,610
If it ever stops working, just hit the button at the bottom.

2749
01:55:35,970 --> 01:55:39,290
The pilot light will fire right up and you'll be back in business.

2750
01:55:40,690 --> 01:55:41,650
Which button?

2751
01:55:41,850 --> 01:55:42,450
That button?

2752
01:55:43,090 --> 01:55:43,570
Okay.

2753
01:55:44,450 --> 01:55:45,270
Don't leave me.

2754
01:55:45,330 --> 01:55:45,730
Don't leave me.

2755
01:55:47,450 --> 01:55:48,750
It's creepy down here.

2756
01:55:48,790 --> 01:55:49,790
Oh, there's the breaker, guys.

2757
01:55:49,910 --> 01:55:52,150
Okay, we know the breaker for the future.

2758
01:55:54,990 --> 01:55:55,950
Hey, sir.

2759
01:55:56,130 --> 01:55:57,630
What's the deal with that room over there?

2760
01:55:59,110 --> 01:56:01,350
Nothing you two need to concern yourselves with.

2761
01:56:03,490 --> 01:56:05,510
I kinda use this basement as storage.

2762
01:56:06,150 --> 01:56:07,530
Renters don't need the space.

2763
01:56:07,790 --> 01:56:09,170
They really ought to keep upstairs.

2764
01:56:10,310 --> 01:56:11,830
Okay, well I was just curious.

2765
01:56:13,770 --> 01:56:14,690
Let's move on.

2766
01:56:18,350 --> 01:56:19,510
What is that, though?

2767
01:56:22,820 --> 01:56:23,840
Just some...

2768
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:24,660
Oh my gosh.

2769
01:56:24,940 --> 01:56:25,620
I'm here.

2770
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:26,500
I'm here.

2771
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:27,560
I'm here.

2772
01:56:28,730 --> 01:56:29,000
What?

2773
01:56:29,140 --> 01:56:29,680
What?

2774
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:30,180
Sorry.

2775
01:56:30,700 --> 01:56:32,280
Did I mention?

2776
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:33,700
Well, no.

2777
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:35,360
Maybe I ought to keep it to myself.

2778
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:42,260
The fella I bought this house from, well, told me his mother died down here.

2779
01:56:43,540 --> 01:56:46,880
Some guests have reported hearing voices at night.

2780
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:49,800
Said they could hear something shuffling down here.

2781
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:56,320
Not to scare you folks, but if I were one of you, I wouldn't really step down here.

2782
01:57:02,840 --> 01:57:03,280
Hehehe.

2783
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:07,540
The looks on your faces.

2784
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:11,680
Come on, now.

2785
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:12,400
I'm just joking.

2786
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:15,660
Don't leave me down here.

2787
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:20,440
At this point, my creep meter was quietly pinging at around 6 out of 10.

2788
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:22,760
Hold on.

2789
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:27,860
Alrighty, folks.

2790
01:57:28,100 --> 01:57:29,180
Snow's starting to pick up.

2791
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:30,480
I'm gonna hit the road now.

2792
01:57:30,740 --> 01:57:32,140
Gotta find that damn cat.

2793
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:34,200
But you're not dressed for the outdoors.

2794
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:35,640
Yeah, only 6?

2795
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:37,380
We're only at a 6?

2796
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:40,640
Sydney's tolerance is insane.

2797
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:42,360
Thanks for showing us around.

2798
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:46,560
By the way...

2799
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:53,000
What was the name on the booking?

2800
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,860
I must be getting old.

2801
01:57:58,290 --> 01:57:59,130
It's Sydney.

2802
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:01,050
Ha!

2803
01:58:01,050 --> 01:58:01,610
Sydney.

2804
01:58:02,510 --> 01:58:03,290
That's right.

2805
01:58:04,490 --> 01:58:06,790
A pretty name for a pretty girl.

2806
01:58:10,430 --> 01:58:12,810
Room $50 a night cleaning $500.

2807
01:58:13,990 --> 01:58:15,890
I don't think this guy is our guy.

2808
01:58:21,650 --> 01:58:23,970
Is it just me or is that dude super weird?

2809
01:58:24,450 --> 01:58:25,610
Uh, very weird.

2810
01:58:25,950 --> 01:58:28,890
Anyway, let's go see if there's anything good on TV.

2811
01:58:29,650 --> 01:58:31,210
Actually, I'm going to take a quick shower.

2812
01:58:31,630 --> 01:58:32,910
Sydney, you just saw...

2813
01:58:33,570 --> 01:58:36,770
You just saw the man we just met and you're gonna go take a shower?

2814
01:58:38,330 --> 01:58:40,510
Cool, I'll find something to watch while you're in there.

2815
01:58:41,430 --> 01:58:42,230
Heh, me.

2816
01:58:43,730 --> 01:58:45,850
Let me know if it feels like you're under a waterfall.

2817
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:47,150
Chuckle.

2818
01:58:47,930 --> 01:58:48,910
What a weird guy.

2819
01:58:50,570 --> 01:58:51,590
You're the weird guy.

2820
01:58:51,790 --> 01:58:52,670
Wait, what do you mean?

2821
01:58:54,890 --> 01:58:55,810
Hopper, welcome to the membership.

2822
01:58:55,830 --> 01:58:56,250
Thank you!

2823
01:58:57,790 --> 01:58:58,190
But...

2824
01:59:00,530 --> 01:59:01,310
Can I take...

2825
01:59:01,310 --> 01:59:02,490
Can I use this shower instead?

2826
01:59:02,570 --> 01:59:05,390
I was keen on taking shower upstairs.

2827
01:59:06,150 --> 01:59:07,950
No, I would feel so much more comfortable!

2828
01:59:08,190 --> 01:59:13,630
Okay, I don't feel comfortable showering next to him, but I would feel more comfortable showering next to him.

2829
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:14,590
You know what I mean?

2830
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:15,650
...

2831
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:19,550
Wait, what?

2832
01:59:19,730 --> 01:59:19,750
...

2833
01:59:21,190 --> 01:59:21,590
...

2834
01:59:21,590 --> 01:59:21,910
...

2835
01:59:21,910 --> 01:59:22,090
...

2836
01:59:38,930 --> 01:59:40,210
I don't like it!

2837
01:59:40,210 --> 01:59:45,790
You're not even sure of this shower!

2838
01:59:50,730 --> 01:59:51,490
Oh, I'll take a shower!

2839
01:59:51,490 --> 01:59:51,850
Oh my gosh.

2840
01:59:52,190 --> 01:59:52,670
He's so big.

2841
01:59:52,670 --> 01:59:53,710
I don't like it!

2842
01:59:56,190 --> 01:59:57,150
Come on, come on.

2843
01:59:57,150 --> 01:59:57,670
Oh my gosh.

2844
01:59:58,530 --> 01:59:59,730
This is where we shower.

2845
02:00:00,050 --> 02:00:00,510
Oh, okay.

2846
02:00:06,030 --> 02:00:06,750
There we go!

2847
02:00:08,710 --> 02:00:11,170
If it's cold, we can tell Mike to go into the basement.

2848
02:00:11,870 --> 02:00:12,390
You know?

2849
02:00:12,530 --> 02:00:13,490
We don't have to do it ourselves.

2850
02:00:15,430 --> 02:00:17,190
I feel so much better.

2851
02:00:18,670 --> 02:00:19,270
I think.

2852
02:00:20,350 --> 02:00:22,050
Oh god, I thought he was gonna be standing there.

2853
02:00:23,030 --> 02:00:23,430
Run.

2854
02:00:24,790 --> 02:00:25,270
Run.

2855
02:00:26,410 --> 02:00:27,210
Run downstairs.

2856
02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:29,650
Run, run, run.

2857
02:00:29,870 --> 02:00:30,950
I took my shower!

2858
02:00:31,730 --> 02:00:32,210
Hey,

2859
02:00:35,370 --> 02:00:35,610
Harp.

2860
02:00:35,670 --> 02:00:36,410
Check this out.

2861
02:00:36,510 --> 02:00:38,070
I found this fishing rod in that shed.

2862
02:00:39,550 --> 02:00:40,630
Planning to catch dinner?

2863
02:00:41,630 --> 02:00:42,850
Now that you mention...

2864
02:00:43,350 --> 02:00:45,310
That would be a pretty epic addition to the trip.

2865
02:00:46,590 --> 02:00:47,690
Mike jump scare.

2866
02:00:50,330 --> 02:00:52,610
I had to show my roommate this...

2867
02:00:52,610 --> 02:00:53,270
This...

2868
02:00:55,590 --> 02:00:56,310
This TikTok...

2869
02:00:57,490 --> 02:00:58,410
Was it TikTok?

2870
02:00:58,770 --> 02:00:59,550
Might have been on Twitter.

2871
02:00:59,670 --> 02:00:59,990
I don't remember.

2872
02:01:00,390 --> 02:01:01,910
But it was basically like...

2873
02:01:03,110 --> 02:01:03,830
Some guy...

2874
02:01:04,870 --> 02:01:06,430
And she does this all the time.

2875
02:01:09,790 --> 02:01:12,330
He'll turn the corner and in the video the guy's like, Oh!

2876
02:01:12,450 --> 02:01:13,330
You scared me there.

2877
02:01:14,370 --> 02:01:18,230
Like the cameraman and then the other guy in the video will be like, Yeah, I live here.

2878
02:01:18,290 --> 02:01:19,130
You should expect me.

2879
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:23,690
And he would just be like...

2880
02:01:23,690 --> 02:01:25,350
It would just be different scenarios.

2881
02:01:25,470 --> 02:01:26,710
Eventually it got up to like...

2882
02:01:26,710 --> 02:01:29,470
Him walking into the dude's room and being like, Whoa!

2883
02:01:29,610 --> 02:01:30,370
Didn't see you there.

2884
02:01:30,390 --> 02:01:30,870
You scared me.

2885
02:01:30,990 --> 02:01:32,690
The guy's like, This is my room.

2886
02:01:33,110 --> 02:01:34,690
This is where I would be.

2887
02:01:35,530 --> 02:01:36,870
But it's the same thing.

2888
02:01:37,170 --> 02:01:38,930
She'll always be like, Whoa!

2889
02:01:39,130 --> 02:01:39,970
You scared me.

2890
02:01:40,410 --> 02:01:40,950
I'm like...

2891
02:01:41,730 --> 02:01:42,170
I...

2892
02:01:42,510 --> 02:01:43,330
I haunt here.

2893
02:01:43,990 --> 02:01:44,430
Like...

2894
02:01:44,430 --> 02:01:47,130
You should expect me to be around the corner sometimes.

2895
02:01:48,930 --> 02:01:49,810
But also...

2896
02:01:49,810 --> 02:01:51,270
I'm so jumpy too.

2897
02:01:51,390 --> 02:01:52,090
So I get it.

2898
02:01:54,090 --> 02:01:55,590
Now that you mentioned...

2899
02:01:55,590 --> 02:01:57,310
That would be a pretty epic addition to the trip.

2900
02:01:58,910 --> 02:01:59,690
Let's do it.

2901
02:02:01,010 --> 02:02:01,890
But fishing.

2902
02:02:02,210 --> 02:02:02,730
You know.

2903
02:02:03,690 --> 02:02:04,330
Hell yeah.

2904
02:02:04,510 --> 02:02:05,070
Follow me.

2905
02:02:05,110 --> 02:02:07,450
There's another rod in the shed and we can both give it a shot.

2906
02:02:09,790 --> 02:02:11,290
What's the other rod, Mikey?

2907
02:02:14,110 --> 02:02:15,570
You just left the door open?

2908
02:02:15,690 --> 02:02:16,510
But it's so cold.

2909
02:02:19,250 --> 02:02:20,630
It's really cold out here.

2910
02:02:21,550 --> 02:02:21,990
Whoa.

2911
02:02:22,130 --> 02:02:22,630
You scared me.

2912
02:02:23,170 --> 02:02:23,570
Whoa.

2913
02:02:23,670 --> 02:02:24,370
You scared me.

2914
02:02:24,550 --> 02:02:26,050
There's nobody in the windows or anything, right?

2915
02:02:27,510 --> 02:02:27,910
Whoa.

2916
02:02:27,950 --> 02:02:28,150
Wait.

2917
02:02:28,710 --> 02:02:29,110
Look.

2918
02:02:29,190 --> 02:02:30,370
That looks like an easel.

2919
02:02:32,590 --> 02:02:33,390
Did they paint?

2920
02:02:35,730 --> 02:02:36,890
The music is so nice.

2921
02:02:41,490 --> 02:02:41,890
Oh.

2922
02:02:42,170 --> 02:02:45,070
He looks really serial killer-y right now.

2923
02:02:46,090 --> 02:02:48,270
Do you want to grab the other fishing rod harp?

2924
02:02:48,790 --> 02:02:49,190
Yeah.

2925
02:02:49,210 --> 02:02:49,910
Just give me a second.

2926
02:02:50,210 --> 02:02:51,070
Where is it?

2927
02:02:51,930 --> 02:02:52,330
Wait.

2928
02:02:53,130 --> 02:02:53,530
Oh.

2929
02:02:53,530 --> 02:02:54,030
Oh.

2930
02:02:54,290 --> 02:02:55,950
I got to put this down, don't I?

2931
02:02:56,070 --> 02:02:56,330
Okay.

2932
02:02:59,470 --> 02:03:00,550
Let's go put it...

2933
02:03:02,450 --> 02:03:03,170
Like here.

2934
02:03:04,590 --> 02:03:06,310
Where we can find it easily, you know?

2935
02:03:13,670 --> 02:03:14,290
Okie dokie.

2936
02:03:16,370 --> 02:03:17,110
Grab the rod.

2937
02:03:17,290 --> 02:03:17,530
Okay.

2938
02:03:17,570 --> 02:03:18,050
We got it.

2939
02:03:18,350 --> 02:03:19,090
And some bait.

2940
02:03:19,650 --> 02:03:20,370
Oh, snap.

2941
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:22,390
I saw a killer recipe for baked carp.

2942
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:24,990
We'll need to catch three carp though.

2943
02:03:25,210 --> 02:03:26,130
You up for the challenge?

2944
02:03:27,650 --> 02:03:28,050
Oh.

2945
02:03:28,050 --> 02:03:29,190
I meant to do dot, dot, dot.

2946
02:03:29,350 --> 02:03:30,250
Well, first things first.

2947
02:03:30,370 --> 02:03:31,490
We need the right bait for carp.

2948
02:03:31,650 --> 02:03:33,310
Check out this bait information board.

2949
02:03:34,490 --> 02:03:38,070
Whenever you're ready, grab a carp bait and let's head to the creek.

2950
02:03:38,290 --> 02:03:39,610
We're going to catch some carp harp.

2951
02:03:40,630 --> 02:03:42,670
Please don't make rhymes with my name.

2952
02:03:47,870 --> 02:03:50,430
So common carp, cheese delight.

2953
02:03:52,030 --> 02:03:53,290
Stop saying carp.

2954
02:03:56,290 --> 02:03:57,850
I think we need a cheese delight.

2955
02:03:59,790 --> 02:04:00,190
Cheese.

2956
02:04:02,030 --> 02:04:02,430
Oh.

2957
02:04:03,650 --> 02:04:04,610
None of those work.

2958
02:04:04,790 --> 02:04:05,270
Let's go.

2959
02:04:05,490 --> 02:04:05,970
Oh, okay.

2960
02:04:06,030 --> 02:04:06,410
We're ready.

2961
02:04:08,350 --> 02:04:09,930
Oh, I needed to attach the bait.

2962
02:04:10,130 --> 02:04:10,870
Come on, harp.

2963
02:04:10,910 --> 02:04:11,410
It's this way.

2964
02:04:12,790 --> 02:04:13,190
RMP.

2965
02:04:13,870 --> 02:04:14,590
To put it...

2966
02:04:14,590 --> 02:04:15,250
Oh, I got it on there.

2967
02:04:15,370 --> 02:04:15,550
Okay.

2968
02:04:16,850 --> 02:04:17,650
Only cheese.

2969
02:04:20,430 --> 02:04:25,990
I guess it doesn't freeze over because it's a creek.

2970
02:04:26,090 --> 02:04:26,790
It's always running.

2971
02:04:27,010 --> 02:04:27,270
Wow.

2972
02:04:27,350 --> 02:04:27,830
This area is...

2973
02:04:27,830 --> 02:04:29,050
This area is so nice.

2974
02:04:32,970 --> 02:04:33,370
Okay.

2975
02:04:33,470 --> 02:04:35,690
Oh, that was going to be my seat, but sure.

2976
02:04:37,190 --> 02:04:38,130
Why did you...

2977
02:04:39,450 --> 02:04:41,330
I hope those carp are biting today.

2978
02:04:41,890 --> 02:04:45,230
Why did you walk on that side if you were going to take the chair closer to me?

2979
02:04:50,890 --> 02:04:52,030
This is kind of nice.

2980
02:04:53,410 --> 02:04:54,990
I'm glad I'm here with you, Mikey.

2981
02:04:56,450 --> 02:04:57,010
Shoo.

2982
02:04:58,990 --> 02:04:59,870
Where's my...

2983
02:04:59,870 --> 02:05:00,870
Where's my line?

2984
02:05:02,790 --> 02:05:04,270
Oh, he's got one.

2985
02:05:06,390 --> 02:05:08,190
Oh, he didn't take it.

2986
02:05:09,490 --> 02:05:10,050
Oh.

2987
02:05:11,570 --> 02:05:12,410
Oh, oh, oh.

2988
02:05:12,410 --> 02:05:12,750
Wait.

2989
02:05:12,830 --> 02:05:13,070
Oh.

2990
02:05:14,190 --> 02:05:14,750
Oh.

2991
02:05:14,790 --> 02:05:15,230
Oh.

2992
02:05:15,290 --> 02:05:16,170
What is this?

2993
02:05:16,430 --> 02:05:17,450
This is bizarre.

2994
02:05:18,050 --> 02:05:18,610
Okay.

2995
02:05:19,230 --> 02:05:20,430
We got it.

2996
02:05:20,450 --> 02:05:21,550
A bluegill.

2997
02:05:22,290 --> 02:05:22,850
Throwback.

2998
02:05:22,950 --> 02:05:23,330
Okay.

2999
02:05:23,370 --> 02:05:24,070
Maybe that's what happened.

3000
02:05:24,210 --> 02:05:24,350
Let's go.

3001
02:05:24,490 --> 02:05:24,970
Oh.

3002
02:05:26,730 --> 02:05:27,170
Geez.

3003
02:05:33,070 --> 02:05:33,950
What about yours?

3004
02:05:34,670 --> 02:05:35,110
No?

3005
02:05:35,310 --> 02:05:35,570
Okay.

3006
02:05:35,970 --> 02:05:36,590
That's fine.

3007
02:05:37,530 --> 02:05:38,230
What we got?

3008
02:05:38,330 --> 02:05:38,650
What we got?

3009
02:05:38,790 --> 02:05:39,010
Oh.

3010
02:05:39,030 --> 02:05:39,330
Oh.

3011
02:05:41,610 --> 02:05:42,050
Oh.

3012
02:05:42,150 --> 02:05:42,590
Oh.

3013
02:05:42,630 --> 02:05:43,070
Oh.

3014
02:05:43,170 --> 02:05:43,610
Oh.

3015
02:05:43,750 --> 02:05:44,190
Oh.

3016
02:05:44,190 --> 02:05:44,350
Oh.

3017
02:05:44,450 --> 02:05:44,850
Oh.

3018
02:05:44,850 --> 02:05:45,030
Oh.

3019
02:05:45,110 --> 02:05:45,170
Oh.

3020
02:05:45,170 --> 02:05:45,510
Oh.

3021
02:05:45,510 --> 02:05:45,770
Oh.

3022
02:05:45,770 --> 02:05:45,830
Oh.

3023
02:05:45,830 --> 02:05:45,870
Oh.

3024
02:05:45,870 --> 02:05:46,070
Oh.

3025
02:05:46,070 --> 02:05:46,110
Oh.

3026
02:05:46,110 --> 02:05:46,210
Oh.

3027
02:05:46,210 --> 02:05:46,290
Oh.

3028
02:05:46,450 --> 02:05:46,890
Oh.

3029
02:05:47,390 --> 02:05:47,830
Oh.

3030
02:05:47,830 --> 02:05:48,530
A carp.

3031
02:05:51,910 --> 02:05:55,670
They say whenever there's one carp, there's always more.

3032
02:05:56,510 --> 02:05:57,650
Who says that?

3033
02:05:59,090 --> 02:06:00,550
Who's saying that, Mikey?

3034
02:06:00,770 --> 02:06:01,810
Let's go fishing.

3035
02:06:02,350 --> 02:06:03,090
Oh, dang it.

3036
02:06:03,990 --> 02:06:05,050
Let's go fishing.

3037
02:06:05,930 --> 02:06:07,050
Oh, dang it.

3038
02:06:07,150 --> 02:06:08,310
Oh, dang it.

3039
02:06:08,590 --> 02:06:09,710
Oh, dang it.

3040
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:11,530
Didn't know you were playing Yakuza 3.

3041
02:06:12,730 --> 02:06:13,810
Mikey says it.

3042
02:06:14,690 --> 02:06:15,750
Stop giving...

3043
02:06:16,430 --> 02:06:17,190
Who is that?

3044
02:06:17,270 --> 02:06:17,810
Oh.

3045
02:06:17,830 --> 02:06:18,350
Who's that back there?

3046
02:06:18,490 --> 02:06:18,850
Oh.

3047
02:06:19,110 --> 02:06:20,190
Who is that back there?

3048
02:06:20,550 --> 02:06:21,830
You guys saw that person walking?

3049
02:06:22,790 --> 02:06:24,630
You saw that person walking over there?

3050
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:34,180
Where'd they go?

3051
02:06:40,440 --> 02:06:41,680
It was too far to cast.

3052
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:41,920
Oh.

3053
02:06:49,170 --> 02:06:49,610
Okay.

3054
02:06:50,430 --> 02:06:51,190
Oh my gosh.

3055
02:06:51,250 --> 02:06:52,050
What if our...

3056
02:06:53,150 --> 02:06:54,210
What if our...

3057
02:06:57,770 --> 02:07:00,550
What if our rod's tied?

3058
02:07:00,670 --> 02:07:01,110
Oh my gosh.

3059
02:07:01,310 --> 02:07:02,930
Why do I keep getting bluegill?

3060
02:07:03,130 --> 02:07:03,630
Throw away.

3061
02:07:16,160 --> 02:07:17,560
Don't cross the streams.

3062
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:23,440
I got a carp.

3063
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:24,040
Okay.

3064
02:07:25,660 --> 02:07:26,100
Woohoo.

3065
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:27,480
Just one more carp left.

3066
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:28,260
You've got this.

3067
02:07:28,300 --> 02:07:28,420
Oh.

3068
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:29,420
Are you not doing anything?

3069
02:07:30,340 --> 02:07:31,540
What are you doing, Mikey?

3070
02:07:32,240 --> 02:07:32,680
Huh?

3071
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:34,940
What are you doing?

3072
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:35,960
Oh.

3073
02:07:37,940 --> 02:07:38,380
Oh.

3074
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:39,700
We're fishing.

3075
02:07:39,780 --> 02:07:40,680
Wishing I was always fishing.

3076
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:42,760
Fish to fathom.

3077
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:45,280
Something, something, fish fear me.

3078
02:07:46,080 --> 02:07:47,120
Woman love me.

3079
02:07:53,700 --> 02:07:54,140
Bluegill.

3080
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:55,020
Throw away.

3081
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:59,040
That's like not the guy that's staring at me right there, right?

3082
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:01,820
That's just...

3083
02:08:01,820 --> 02:08:02,200
That was...

3084
02:08:02,200 --> 02:08:03,440
That's been there the whole time, right?

3085
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:06,360
Guy per...

3086
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:07,040
The guy disappeared.

3087
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:09,380
So I can't tell.

3088
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:20,300
Whoa, I'm a genius?

3089
02:08:20,580 --> 02:08:21,920
I'm so good at this, I'm a pro.

3090
02:08:24,220 --> 02:08:25,380
He's staring at Mike.

3091
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:30,800
He's like, dang, that guy's so skilled.

3092
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:34,680
Oh my gosh, it's tiny.

3093
02:08:35,240 --> 02:08:37,360
I think I got the rarest fish there is.

3094
02:08:44,550 --> 02:08:45,830
Please, this is so difficult!

3095
02:08:49,830 --> 02:08:50,310
Please!

3096
02:08:50,470 --> 02:08:51,210
Oh my god.

3097
02:08:58,980 --> 02:08:59,840
Please, fish!

3098
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:04,000
Please!

3099
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:04,680
Please!

3100
02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:06,680
This is so hard!

3101
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:07,880
Please!

3102
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:10,280
Please!

3103
02:09:11,020 --> 02:09:13,300
Please, just take...

3104
02:09:14,300 --> 02:09:15,140
Oh my god.

3105
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:15,940
Okay, hold on.

3106
02:09:18,460 --> 02:09:19,480
Don't worry, Harp.

3107
02:09:19,480 --> 02:09:21,220
The fish are just playing hard to get today.

3108
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:23,140
Kind of like someone else I know.

3109
02:09:32,390 --> 02:09:32,910
Whack!

3110
02:09:32,910 --> 02:09:33,390
Whack!

3111
02:09:36,470 --> 02:09:37,310
Riz, maybe?

3112
02:09:38,110 --> 02:09:38,310
Hahaha!

3113
02:09:43,330 --> 02:09:45,150
No, Mike, I'm just not interested in you.

3114
02:09:50,220 --> 02:09:50,960
Take a hint!

3115
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:51,960
Yeah!

3116
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:56,580
Looks like we got three carp.

3117
02:09:56,780 --> 02:09:59,140
Do you want to head back and throw these in the oven for dinner?

3118
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:00,840
Let's do it.

3119
02:10:01,180 --> 02:10:02,580
Mike is the true creep here.

3120
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:03,860
How do I get up?

3121
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:04,800
Wait, hold on.

3122
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:06,320
Mike, how do I stand?

3123
02:10:06,500 --> 02:10:06,900
Oh, here.

3124
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:07,500
I think it was space.

3125
02:10:08,360 --> 02:10:08,720
Okay.

3126
02:10:11,580 --> 02:10:12,740
Look, we even got a...

3127
02:10:13,160 --> 02:10:13,520
Oh.

3128
02:10:18,010 --> 02:10:19,770
Oh no, the creepy music is coming back.

3129
02:10:19,950 --> 02:10:20,690
No, no, no!

3130
02:10:21,470 --> 02:10:21,950
No!

3131
02:10:22,130 --> 02:10:23,410
I think he's hooked on you.

3132
02:10:24,610 --> 02:10:26,330
No, the creepy music is coming back!

3133
02:10:28,070 --> 02:10:28,550
No!

3134
02:10:28,690 --> 02:10:29,910
I like the music before!

3135
02:10:30,750 --> 02:10:31,150
No!

3136
02:10:32,790 --> 02:10:34,610
I don't see anyone in the house.

3137
02:10:38,110 --> 02:10:38,590
Okay.

3138
02:10:44,340 --> 02:10:44,820
Huh!

3139
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:49,440
While I'm cleaning the fish, do you mind prepping the marinade?

3140
02:10:49,980 --> 02:10:51,360
I'm not sure how to do marinade.

3141
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:56,340
Just take a bowl and throw in ginger paste, cooking oil, black pepper...

3142
02:10:56,340 --> 02:10:56,420
Okay.

3143
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:56,660
Wait.

3144
02:10:56,860 --> 02:10:58,520
Hold on.

3145
02:10:58,620 --> 02:10:59,100
This is...

3146
02:10:59,100 --> 02:10:59,600
Wait.

3147
02:10:59,700 --> 02:11:00,480
Can I get...

3148
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:01,700
Can you write this down?

3149
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:08,940
Throw in ginger paste, cooking oil, black pepper, salt, Italian seasoning, paprika, and yogurt.

3150
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:12,020
I think we only brought, like, milk and beans.

3151
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:14,160
Mike, I don't think we have all this.

3152
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:15,000
Wait.

3153
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:15,840
Huh?

3154
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:23,500
Mike, the door.

3155
02:11:23,540 --> 02:11:23,760
To the door.

3156
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:24,440
To the basement is open.

3157
02:11:24,580 --> 02:11:26,080
Mike, the door to the basement is open.

3158
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:28,000
Mike, the door to the basement is open.

3159
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:28,340
Mikey!

3160
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:28,620
Mikey!

3161
02:11:28,740 --> 02:11:28,980
Mikey!

3162
02:11:29,020 --> 02:11:29,280
Mikey!

3163
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:29,720
Mikey!

3164
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:30,040
Mikey!

3165
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:30,380
Mikey!

3166
02:11:30,380 --> 02:11:30,720
Mikey!

3167
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:31,040
Mikey!

3168
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:31,300
Mikey!

3169
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:31,540
Mikey!

3170
02:11:31,660 --> 02:11:31,820
Mikey!

3171
02:11:31,900 --> 02:11:32,100
Mikey!

3172
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:32,260
Mikey!

3173
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:32,480
Mikey!

3174
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:32,700
Mikey!

3175
02:11:32,700 --> 02:11:32,840
Mikey!

3176
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:32,940
Mikey!

3177
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:33,180
Mikey!

3178
02:11:33,500 --> 02:11:33,860
Mikey!

3179
02:11:33,860 --> 02:11:34,020
Mikey!

3180
02:11:48,840 --> 02:11:49,200
Mikey!

3181
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:50,780
Mike, why can't you listen to me?

3182
02:11:50,780 --> 02:11:51,960
Mike, you never listen to me.

3183
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:55,680
Okay.

3184
02:11:57,940 --> 02:11:59,260
Alright, so we need...

3185
02:11:59,260 --> 02:12:00,980
What do we need?

3186
02:12:01,060 --> 02:12:01,420
Yogurt?

3187
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:04,040
Where do I put this?

3188
02:12:04,100 --> 02:12:04,380
In a bowl?

3189
02:12:04,540 --> 02:12:05,220
Okay, yogurt.

3190
02:12:06,160 --> 02:12:06,560
Salt.

3191
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:10,660
Oh, ginger... ginger paste.

3192
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:12,580
Ginger garlic paste.

3193
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:13,900
Corn flakes?

3194
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:14,260
No.

3195
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:15,040
Salt.

3196
02:12:16,040 --> 02:12:16,440
Pepper.

3197
02:12:17,900 --> 02:12:18,300
Paprika.

3198
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:21,820
Something's gonna be outside that window, isn't it?

3199
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:23,120
Olive oil.

3200
02:12:27,460 --> 02:12:28,180
Paprika again?

3201
02:12:28,420 --> 02:12:28,860
Wait.

3202
02:12:30,500 --> 02:12:32,100
Oh, I did the Italian seasoning.

3203
02:12:34,820 --> 02:12:35,300
Okay.

3204
02:12:36,300 --> 02:12:37,040
Oh, paprika.

3205
02:12:40,730 --> 02:12:41,590
Okay, I'll finish.

3206
02:12:43,290 --> 02:12:44,250
What are those?

3207
02:12:45,810 --> 02:12:46,770
Oh, lemons.

3208
02:12:48,950 --> 02:12:52,550
Do you mind throwing the fish in the marinade in the casserole?

3209
02:12:52,710 --> 02:12:53,870
While I chop these veggies?

3210
02:12:54,190 --> 02:12:54,910
On it.

3211
02:12:59,450 --> 02:13:00,270
I'm scared.

3212
02:13:00,610 --> 02:13:01,690
Wait, where's the fish?

3213
02:13:03,710 --> 02:13:04,970
What'd you do with the fish?

3214
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:06,350
Weren't they in here?

3215
02:13:08,590 --> 02:13:09,730
What'd you do with them?

3216
02:13:13,090 --> 02:13:14,570
What did you do with the fish?

3217
02:13:17,230 --> 02:13:18,210
Two carps?

3218
02:13:19,570 --> 02:13:20,510
They're in the cooler?

3219
02:13:22,350 --> 02:13:22,870
Oh.

3220
02:13:25,410 --> 02:13:25,950
No.

3221
02:13:28,050 --> 02:13:29,370
Where did I put them?

3222
02:13:29,810 --> 02:13:30,870
Oh, they're here.

3223
02:13:31,150 --> 02:13:31,890
This cooler.

3224
02:13:32,270 --> 02:13:32,830
Oh, okay.

3225
02:13:33,710 --> 02:13:34,250
One.

3226
02:13:36,050 --> 02:13:36,590
Two.

3227
02:13:37,310 --> 02:13:37,850
Marinade.

3228
02:13:39,810 --> 02:13:40,730
And veggies.

3229
02:13:42,030 --> 02:13:42,790
Oh, good.

3230
02:13:42,950 --> 02:13:44,170
Now could you add the veggies?

3231
02:13:44,290 --> 02:13:45,230
That's what I just did.

3232
02:13:45,770 --> 02:13:49,770
I read it needs to go for 30 minutes at 400.

3233
02:13:54,300 --> 02:13:54,840
I...

3234
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:55,080
I...

3235
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:55,460
Did that?

3236
02:13:55,640 --> 02:13:55,860
Okay.

3237
02:13:57,680 --> 02:13:58,080
Okay.

3238
02:13:58,380 --> 02:13:59,660
Cooking sim, for real.

3239
02:14:04,130 --> 02:14:05,930
Those carp are going to taste amazing.

3240
02:14:06,750 --> 02:14:07,990
I hope they're not...

3241
02:14:07,990 --> 02:14:09,010
I hope they're clean.

3242
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:15,730
Like, I know that they're like from the wild, but I mean, what if there's like, I don't know, radiation in these parts?

3243
02:14:15,830 --> 02:14:16,210
Who knows?

3244
02:14:17,430 --> 02:14:19,890
While we wait for it to cook, how about we play some board games?

3245
02:14:20,550 --> 02:14:22,770
I saw some in the room next to the living room.

3246
02:14:23,150 --> 02:14:23,690
Which one?

3247
02:14:24,430 --> 02:14:26,130
Just grab whatever catches your eye.

3248
02:14:26,270 --> 02:14:27,490
Can't wait to see what you pick.

3249
02:14:27,490 --> 02:14:29,570
I saw some in the room next to the living room.

3250
02:14:29,790 --> 02:14:30,630
Okay, let me see.

3251
02:14:30,730 --> 02:14:32,450
You guys, should we do the Ouija board?

3252
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:35,350
Should we do the Ouija board?

3253
02:14:37,210 --> 02:14:38,370
What's one that you...

3254
02:14:38,370 --> 02:14:40,590
If you've watched someone play this game before...

3255
02:14:40,590 --> 02:14:42,830
Oh my gosh, can you come over here though, please?

3256
02:14:43,410 --> 02:14:46,970
If you've seen someone play this game before, what's one that people...

3257
02:14:46,970 --> 02:14:48,610
What's one that you haven't seen someone pick?

3258
02:14:51,710 --> 02:14:53,150
Because I want to do one that you...

3259
02:14:53,150 --> 02:14:55,470
If you've watched someone play this game before...

3260
02:14:56,750 --> 02:14:57,470
What is one that you haven't seen someone pick?

3261
02:14:57,490 --> 02:14:58,050
What is one that you haven't...

3262
02:14:58,050 --> 02:14:58,570
Chess?

3263
02:15:00,070 --> 02:15:01,350
Oh, everyone does Luigi.

3264
02:15:05,230 --> 02:15:05,710
Chess?

3265
02:15:05,790 --> 02:15:06,430
Okay, we'll do chess.

3266
02:15:11,330 --> 02:15:12,810
All right, time for nerd game.

3267
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:18,190
That's a classic.

3268
02:15:18,330 --> 02:15:20,530
How about we go for something with a bit of mystery?

3269
02:15:21,310 --> 02:15:23,390
You said I could pick whatever I wanted.

3270
02:15:24,010 --> 02:15:25,610
Mikey, this is so unfair.

3271
02:15:26,490 --> 02:15:27,770
I hate you.

3272
02:15:28,210 --> 02:15:29,210
I hate you.

3273
02:15:30,390 --> 02:15:32,150
Something with a bit more suspense.

3274
02:15:32,150 --> 02:15:32,510
I hate you.

3275
02:15:33,910 --> 02:15:34,870
You suck!

3276
02:15:34,950 --> 02:15:35,810
You're so...

3277
02:15:37,150 --> 02:15:38,830
I can't stand this guy.

3278
02:15:44,820 --> 02:15:45,760
Let's try this one.

3279
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:47,500
Whatever this Whispers in the Dark is.

3280
02:15:47,820 --> 02:15:49,120
I'm curious about it.

3281
02:15:49,860 --> 02:15:51,700
You can pick anything but that.

3282
02:15:53,140 --> 02:15:53,620
Yeah.

3283
02:15:56,540 --> 02:15:57,240
I don't know.

3284
02:15:57,260 --> 02:15:58,700
Maybe something with a bit more suspense.

3285
02:15:59,020 --> 02:16:01,400
This is like a murder mystery.

3286
02:16:01,460 --> 02:16:02,440
What are you talking about?

3287
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:07,020
It's called Whispers in the Dark!

3288
02:16:15,180 --> 02:16:16,780
I cannot stand you.

3289
02:16:16,860 --> 02:16:17,820
Wanna get a game?

3290
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:20,860
Just grab whatever catches your eye!

3291
02:16:21,120 --> 02:16:21,860
This guy sucks!

3292
02:16:25,080 --> 02:16:25,540
Mike!

3293
02:16:25,540 --> 02:16:27,380
I'm trying to be on your side here.

3294
02:16:27,460 --> 02:16:28,120
I really am.

3295
02:16:28,260 --> 02:16:30,880
But you're just being such a jerk.

3296
02:16:36,670 --> 02:16:37,130
Jenga.

3297
02:16:37,130 --> 02:16:39,010
Is this mysterious enough for you?

3298
02:16:40,610 --> 02:16:42,790
Does this have enough air of mystery?

3299
02:16:43,870 --> 02:16:44,430
Ah!

3300
02:16:44,650 --> 02:16:45,910
What the fuck?

3301
02:16:47,190 --> 02:16:47,750
What?

3302
02:16:49,470 --> 02:16:50,350
Tower stack.

3303
02:16:50,650 --> 02:16:51,670
Nice choice, Harp.

3304
02:16:51,730 --> 02:16:53,230
It's been ages since I played this.

3305
02:16:55,030 --> 02:16:59,830
Mike really acting like a girlfriend after asking what she wants for dinner.

3306
02:17:00,110 --> 02:17:02,730
I can't believe this is the suspense you wanted!

3307
02:17:05,430 --> 02:17:07,630
Okay, let's see how steady those hands are.

3308
02:17:09,250 --> 02:17:10,550
I hate you.

3309
02:17:10,650 --> 02:17:11,870
I hate you.

3310
02:17:12,270 --> 02:17:13,430
I hate you.

3311
02:17:13,470 --> 02:17:15,050
You're just throwing me out of the game.

3312
02:17:17,670 --> 02:17:18,850
Whenever you're ready, Harp.

3313
02:17:24,550 --> 02:17:25,070
What the?

3314
02:17:25,830 --> 02:17:26,870
Draw the loop.

3315
02:17:29,690 --> 02:17:30,170
Huh?

3316
02:17:30,170 --> 02:17:32,590
Am I gonna get jumpscared here and like...

3317
02:17:34,290 --> 02:17:35,250
What a hunt.

3318
02:17:35,990 --> 02:17:36,470
Stop!

3319
02:17:36,850 --> 02:17:37,630
Damn, Harp.

3320
02:17:37,710 --> 02:17:39,310
Do you practice this in your free time?

3321
02:17:39,570 --> 02:17:40,470
Shut up, Mikey.

3322
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:45,620
On a roll here.

3323
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:46,880
It's the first one.

3324
02:17:46,980 --> 02:17:47,980
Don't get so excited.

3325
02:17:48,280 --> 02:17:49,240
Wait, what about me?

3326
02:17:49,520 --> 02:17:50,560
You get to go twice?

3327
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:51,240
What about me?

3328
02:17:52,260 --> 02:17:52,780
Boom.

3329
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:54,660
Another perfect move by yours truly.

3330
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:55,640
He's cheating.

3331
02:17:55,780 --> 02:17:56,320
He's cheating.

3332
02:17:59,220 --> 02:18:00,420
Gonna make him lose.

3333
02:18:02,020 --> 02:18:02,740
How though?

3334
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:07,580
I'm just gonna keep taking middle pieces.

3335
02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:12,880
I feel like there's gonna be a jumpscare here.

3336
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:15,340
They're gonna make you concentrate on doing the circle.

3337
02:18:16,940 --> 02:18:19,580
And then he proceeds to say she's playing hard to get.

3338
02:18:19,720 --> 02:18:20,500
Way to go, Mike.

3339
02:18:20,600 --> 02:18:26,740
You guys, if you were trying to woo someone over, don't be like Mike, okay?

3340
02:18:27,860 --> 02:18:28,900
Oh, you scared me.

3341
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:30,080
Didn't think you'd be streaming.

3342
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:34,420
Don't be like Mike.

3343
02:18:34,700 --> 02:18:35,700
Too easy, right?

3344
02:18:40,310 --> 02:18:41,430
On a roll here.

3345
02:18:42,210 --> 02:18:43,730
Why does he get to go twice?

3346
02:18:43,730 --> 02:18:46,210
This guy is actually cheating.

3347
02:18:47,670 --> 02:18:49,250
This is so messed up.

3348
02:18:50,650 --> 02:18:52,690
I want him to lose so badly.

3349
02:18:55,250 --> 02:18:57,070
I want him to lose so badly.

3350
02:18:59,310 --> 02:19:00,110
That was close.

3351
02:19:02,730 --> 02:19:06,170
I think as long as I do this right, it won't fall, right?

3352
02:19:08,170 --> 02:19:09,790
Harp, you're making this game look easy.

3353
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:17,840
This is how it's done, Harp.

3354
02:19:17,880 --> 02:19:19,560
Okay, I'm playing the game well, too.

3355
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:20,920
Not just you, all right?

3356
02:19:23,640 --> 02:19:25,300
So if I like do this one, you think?

3357
02:19:34,290 --> 02:19:35,430
Smooth moves, Harp.

3358
02:19:37,890 --> 02:19:39,950
Okay, now you're just taking stuff from the top.

3359
02:19:40,970 --> 02:19:42,710
Time to channel my inner architect.

3360
02:19:44,870 --> 02:19:45,230
Okay.

3361
02:19:46,310 --> 02:19:47,230
Okay, good, good, good.

3362
02:19:47,370 --> 02:19:47,710
All right.

3363
02:19:48,250 --> 02:19:49,110
Let's do this one.

3364
02:19:49,170 --> 02:19:49,550
Let's just...

3365
02:19:49,550 --> 02:19:50,930
Whoa, okay, okay, okay.

3366
02:19:51,110 --> 02:19:51,510
All right.

3367
02:19:56,100 --> 02:19:56,460
Okay.

3368
02:19:56,960 --> 02:20:00,540
See, they're gonna make you like be really concentrating on this.

3369
02:20:00,620 --> 02:20:03,440
And then they're gonna jump scare you with like a big bang or something, you know?

3370
02:20:05,740 --> 02:20:06,760
You're a pro, Harp.

3371
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:10,260
Oh, he's going for the bottom.

3372
02:20:10,420 --> 02:20:11,400
He's going for the bottom.

3373
02:20:14,560 --> 02:20:15,080
I'm scared.

3374
02:20:26,310 --> 02:20:27,150
Oops, tower down.

3375
02:20:27,390 --> 02:20:28,390
Let's not dwell on it.

3376
02:20:28,450 --> 02:20:29,010
Another game?

3377
02:20:29,730 --> 02:20:30,130
Okay.

3378
02:20:45,240 --> 02:20:46,860
I guess this game has suspense.

3379
02:20:47,220 --> 02:20:47,920
Yeah, I guess so.

3380
02:20:49,440 --> 02:20:50,840
So I have to win, I guess.

3381
02:20:51,560 --> 02:20:52,680
How do I make him lose?

3382
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:56,100
Oh my gosh, seriously?

3383
02:20:58,060 --> 02:20:59,540
But actually, how do I make him lose?

3384
02:20:59,640 --> 02:21:00,920
I'm just gonna keep taking the middles.

3385
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:13,100
Is the fish not overcooked yet?

3386
02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:15,260
That's a half hour real time.

3387
02:21:15,460 --> 02:21:15,860
No, I'm just kidding.

3388
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:20,860
Our little square.

3389
02:21:23,900 --> 02:21:24,820
What the?

3390
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:27,800
What do you mean?

3391
02:21:28,420 --> 02:21:29,580
I drew it.

3392
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:35,060
You're a pro.

3393
02:21:35,420 --> 02:21:36,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3394
02:21:37,180 --> 02:21:37,900
Lose.

3395
02:21:39,480 --> 02:21:40,200
Yeah!

3396
02:21:41,460 --> 02:21:43,040
Oh, snap.

3397
02:21:43,440 --> 02:21:45,220
Didn't expect it to fall like that.

3398
02:21:45,620 --> 02:21:46,800
I think I've had enough.

3399
02:21:49,340 --> 02:21:51,900
Mike's not the same after working with General X.

3400
02:21:52,720 --> 02:21:54,020
That was a fun game, Harp.

3401
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:55,100
You did really well.

3402
02:21:56,180 --> 02:21:58,360
All right, the carp should be just about done.

3403
02:21:58,500 --> 02:21:59,480
Let's grab some plates.

3404
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:00,520
I'm starving.

3405
02:22:01,940 --> 02:22:02,340
Yeah.

3406
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:04,680
Oh, I was like, what's this on the ground?

3407
02:22:05,640 --> 02:22:06,200
That's me.

3408
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:07,160
I made a bit of a mess.

3409
02:22:09,720 --> 02:22:11,740
I wonder what happens if you do the Ouija board.

3410
02:22:17,800 --> 02:22:21,500
Oh, I think our show is about to come on.

3411
02:22:21,640 --> 02:22:23,440
You want to watch TV while we eat?

3412
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:24,440
Sure.

3413
02:22:27,140 --> 02:22:28,360
I'll have to grab a plate.

3414
02:22:28,620 --> 02:22:30,080
He couldn't make the plate for me.

3415
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:36,720
For some guy, for a guy who's interested in me, he's like not very considerate, you know?

3416
02:22:37,940 --> 02:22:42,540
Like sometimes, you know, if you're into someone, you like do things for them.

3417
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:45,620
Like when you, you know, you're just like, oh, yeah, I'll make your plate for you.

3418
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:46,940
Or, you know, just stuff like that.

3419
02:22:47,160 --> 02:22:49,380
Just small things that like, you know.

3420
02:22:51,020 --> 02:22:53,700
The bare-handed reach in the oven is insane.

3421
02:22:55,980 --> 02:22:57,360
There's a reason he's your ex.

3422
02:23:00,480 --> 02:23:00,840
What?

3423
02:23:03,620 --> 02:23:04,460
Mikey's our ex?

3424
02:23:05,360 --> 02:23:06,580
Hey, girl, want to get a good dinner?

3425
02:23:06,660 --> 02:23:11,140
I'll order for you, force you to play games I want, and at the end, make you pay for dinner.

3426
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:12,420
Girls love that, right?

3427
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:20,520
Wait, how is he our ex?

3428
02:23:20,600 --> 02:23:22,180
I don't, I don't think I got that lore.

3429
02:23:22,960 --> 02:23:25,380
We had to catch that show on TV while we ate.

3430
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:26,280
Oh, turn it on.

3431
02:23:27,620 --> 02:23:28,480
Oh, okay.

3432
02:23:28,580 --> 02:23:29,740
Mikey can't do anything.

3433
02:23:30,060 --> 02:23:32,120
He's like, turn on the TV for us.

3434
02:23:32,140 --> 02:23:33,160
Oh, my God.

3435
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:34,980
With a little bit of vinegar.

3436
02:23:35,360 --> 02:23:39,200
Gotta keep that fancy flavor in there.

3437
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:43,020
The next thing we prepare is the mayonnaise.

3438
02:23:43,100 --> 02:23:45,260
Why is there always a weird TV show?

3439
02:23:45,260 --> 02:23:48,400
I'm gonna try this in a pan with Irish tofu.

3440
02:23:49,160 --> 02:23:53,120
I'm not gonna lie, this is gonna taste like shit.

3441
02:23:53,400 --> 02:23:53,820
What?

3442
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:58,920
But here you are, anyway, listening to my cooking instructions.

3443
02:23:59,340 --> 02:24:01,820
This is the brine of the mayonnaise.

3444
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:09,100
We gotta inject it with a little anesthesia to make sure it doesn't revolt against us.

3445
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:12,260
It gets very angry once it knows we're trying to cook it.

3446
02:24:12,260 --> 02:24:13,060
I was done with it.

3447
02:24:16,340 --> 02:24:18,180
Harp, that was some damn fine food.

3448
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:20,360
Twice as good since we caught the fish ourselves.

3449
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:22,020
It was all right.

3450
02:24:22,740 --> 02:24:24,840
You don't have to rain on my parade, Harp.

3451
02:24:26,340 --> 02:24:29,400
It was no Moe's Pizza, but I thought it turned out well.

3452
02:24:30,760 --> 02:24:31,480
Hey, anyways.

3453
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:35,560
I need to check my emails real quick.

3454
02:24:35,780 --> 02:24:36,720
Left my laptop upstairs.

3455
02:24:38,600 --> 02:24:41,480
That little place makes his living room look so cozy.

3456
02:24:42,280 --> 02:24:43,040
I'm gonna check my emails real quick.

3457
02:24:43,060 --> 02:24:44,440
I thought we were taking a break from work.

3458
02:24:44,900 --> 02:24:45,680
It's not work.

3459
02:24:45,700 --> 02:24:48,020
I'm just waiting on shipment details for my new DS.

3460
02:24:50,340 --> 02:24:51,160
I'll be right back.

3461
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:54,320
All right, I'll clean up here.

3462
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:01,200
I'll keep the TV on just cause I'm scared.

3463
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:04,820
Well, I want it on in the background.

3464
02:25:05,580 --> 02:25:06,380
You know?

3465
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:10,400
Okay.

3466
02:25:13,060 --> 02:25:13,960
What is going on?

3467
02:25:14,100 --> 02:25:17,500
Why is there always weird TV shows in this game?

3468
02:25:20,020 --> 02:25:20,820
Our ramen.

3469
02:25:21,220 --> 02:25:22,720
We don't see anyone out there, do we?

3470
02:25:22,860 --> 02:25:23,120
Okay.

3471
02:25:26,040 --> 02:25:27,660
How do I wash the dishes?

3472
02:25:27,800 --> 02:25:28,760
Oh, had to get the plates.

3473
02:25:29,020 --> 02:25:29,900
Yeah, I have them.

3474
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:32,000
Had to do both of our plates.

3475
02:25:32,020 --> 02:25:32,640
Okay, I have them.

3476
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:35,600
Dish washing.

3477
02:25:35,720 --> 02:25:36,040
I'm scared.

3478
02:25:36,400 --> 02:25:36,980
I'm scared.

3479
02:25:37,540 --> 02:25:39,160
Something's gonna pop out of the window.

3480
02:25:40,020 --> 02:25:41,720
It's forcing me to dish wash.

3481
02:25:43,060 --> 02:25:43,480
Oh, Mikey!

3482
02:25:43,860 --> 02:25:44,920
Come back downstairs!

3483
02:25:46,830 --> 02:25:47,120
No!

3484
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:48,960
I'm scared.

3485
02:25:49,320 --> 02:25:50,520
Use some soap!

3486
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:51,880
That was it?

3487
02:25:56,560 --> 02:25:57,520
That's it for real?

3488
02:25:58,480 --> 02:25:59,060
Okay.

3489
02:26:00,040 --> 02:26:00,620
Oh.

3490
02:26:01,460 --> 02:26:02,340
Michael J.

3491
02:26:02,380 --> 02:26:02,660
Carter.

3492
02:26:03,020 --> 02:26:03,700
Oh, that's Mikey.

3493
02:26:15,560 --> 02:26:16,040
What?

3494
02:26:19,060 --> 02:26:20,460
Is this so rude?

3495
02:26:20,580 --> 02:26:22,920
Is this the way to get me in your bedroom, Mikey?

3496
02:26:23,240 --> 02:26:23,540
No.

3497
02:26:24,440 --> 02:26:25,320
Bye, Grandma.

3498
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:27,220
Stay in your room.

3499
02:26:30,670 --> 02:26:31,630
You're not a man.

3500
02:26:33,810 --> 02:26:34,290
Okay.

3501
02:26:34,450 --> 02:26:36,250
I'm glad she ate that up.

3502
02:26:36,990 --> 02:26:37,330
I'm...

3503
02:26:42,500 --> 02:26:42,980
Leave.

3504
02:26:44,160 --> 02:26:45,460
Yeah, I'm getting out of here.

3505
02:26:45,860 --> 02:26:46,660
Bye, Mikey.

3506
02:26:48,400 --> 02:26:49,180
Bye, Mikey.

3507
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:51,540
I really could just leave.

3508
02:26:51,580 --> 02:26:51,660
Okay.

3509
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:53,860
If I really wanted to.

3510
02:26:54,340 --> 02:26:55,660
I could just run out of there.

3511
02:27:01,940 --> 02:27:03,500
I guess we have to be brave.

3512
02:27:04,560 --> 02:27:05,500
Which room is his?

3513
02:27:06,020 --> 02:27:06,540
This one?

3514
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:09,700
Don't make sounds.

3515
02:27:09,780 --> 02:27:10,180
Walk slow.

3516
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:12,640
Where are you?

3517
02:27:13,380 --> 02:27:14,320
Are you in this room?

3518
02:27:16,420 --> 02:27:17,100
I'm scared.

3519
02:27:27,910 --> 02:27:28,690
Is he there?

3520
02:27:28,690 --> 02:27:29,570
Is he the one under the bed?

3521
02:27:32,030 --> 02:27:33,470
Is he the one under the bed?

3522
02:27:33,990 --> 02:27:35,490
He just wants me in his bedroom.

3523
02:27:35,770 --> 02:27:36,610
This freak!

3524
02:27:46,260 --> 02:27:46,740
Gotcha!

3525
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:51,300
You're lucky I didn't break your nose.

3526
02:27:51,580 --> 02:27:54,120
My good looks are half my charm, Harp.

3527
02:27:54,180 --> 02:27:55,180
Don't mess them up.

3528
02:28:03,300 --> 02:28:05,080
I totally got you.

3529
02:28:07,580 --> 02:28:09,980
He just wanted me in his bedroom.

3530
02:28:10,440 --> 02:28:11,540
This freak!

3531
02:28:13,700 --> 02:28:14,980
That was fun, wasn't it?

3532
02:28:15,040 --> 02:28:15,860
It's not cool.

3533
02:28:16,060 --> 02:28:16,720
Come on.

3534
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:17,680
It was just a joke.

3535
02:28:18,600 --> 02:28:20,000
You wanna go for the next round?

3536
02:28:20,400 --> 02:28:21,400
Next round?

3537
02:28:21,860 --> 02:28:23,560
How about a game of hide and seek?

3538
02:28:23,820 --> 02:28:24,240
No!

3539
02:28:26,140 --> 02:28:26,620
No!

3540
02:28:26,900 --> 02:28:29,760
No, no, no, no, no!

3541
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:31,220
Mikey's such a freak!

3542
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:32,020
I hate this guy!

3543
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:34,080
Who suggests this?

3544
02:28:34,140 --> 02:28:34,980
Who suggests this?

3545
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:35,700
Who suggests this?

3546
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:39,320
I'll get back to you for this.

3547
02:28:39,760 --> 02:28:41,340
Whatever you say, Sydney Harper.

3548
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:43,160
Alright, you're on.

3549
02:28:43,240 --> 02:28:43,960
I'll count to ten.

3550
02:28:45,640 --> 02:28:46,120
Oh.

3551
02:28:46,820 --> 02:28:47,300
No.

3552
02:28:48,060 --> 02:28:49,380
I'm hiding in here.

3553
02:28:49,780 --> 02:28:51,740
I decided to hide in the basement!

3554
02:28:52,940 --> 02:28:53,960
Sydney, you're an idiot.

3555
02:28:54,220 --> 02:28:55,400
Sydney, you're so stupid.

3556
02:28:57,100 --> 02:28:58,340
I don't wanna play this anymore.

3557
02:28:58,680 --> 02:28:59,960
Why don't you go hide now?

3558
02:29:08,260 --> 02:29:13,420
I think the person who sent in this story, Sydney Harper, is dumb as hell.

3559
02:29:15,220 --> 02:29:16,960
I think she's so stupid.

3560
02:29:18,800 --> 02:29:21,020
I think Sydney is an idiot.

3561
02:29:22,540 --> 02:29:25,700
And probably deserves everything that's happening to her.

3562
02:29:26,740 --> 02:29:27,940
Okay, where am I gonna hide?

3563
02:29:27,980 --> 02:29:28,220
In here?

3564
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:29,380
Couldn't open the door.

3565
02:29:29,620 --> 02:29:29,880
Oh.

3566
02:29:30,980 --> 02:29:32,500
Where do I decide to hide?

3567
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:32,800
Oh!

3568
02:29:34,360 --> 02:29:34,840
What?!

3569
02:29:35,580 --> 02:29:36,060
Sydney!

3570
02:29:37,640 --> 02:29:38,600
Sydney Harper!

3571
02:29:38,820 --> 02:29:40,540
You are so stupid!

3572
02:30:43,250 --> 02:30:43,610
What?!

3573
02:30:43,610 --> 02:30:43,970
How?!

3574
02:30:44,730 --> 02:30:46,610
Okay, sorry that I had to mute the game.

3575
02:30:47,050 --> 02:30:48,150
It was picking...

3576
02:30:48,150 --> 02:30:49,830
So I think it was doing my streaming mic.

3577
02:30:50,210 --> 02:30:51,750
Which picks up the music as well.

3578
02:30:52,490 --> 02:30:53,850
So I had to like...

3579
02:30:53,850 --> 02:30:56,130
Or rather, it picks up the game, not just my voice.

3580
02:30:56,170 --> 02:30:56,970
So I had to mute everything.

3581
02:30:58,490 --> 02:30:58,850
Aha!

3582
02:30:59,090 --> 02:30:59,710
Got you!

3583
02:31:01,030 --> 02:31:02,110
That wasn't even a challenge.

3584
02:31:02,150 --> 02:31:05,770
That's why I muted my mic and it was still like the bar was still going kinda crazy.

3585
02:31:06,430 --> 02:31:07,550
That wasn't even a challenge.

3586
02:31:07,670 --> 02:31:11,250
I figured you would be good at this ever... since I never find you in the city.

3587
02:31:11,970 --> 02:31:12,330
Maybe.

3588
02:31:12,350 --> 02:31:13,350
Maybe you need to look harder.

3589
02:31:14,770 --> 02:31:16,590
Alright, my turn to hide now.

3590
02:31:16,990 --> 02:31:19,090
You better close your eyes and start counting.

3591
02:31:20,170 --> 02:31:21,530
Okay, I'm leaving.

3592
02:31:21,830 --> 02:31:22,430
I'm leaving.

3593
02:31:24,290 --> 02:31:25,390
Mike was hiding.

3594
02:31:25,650 --> 02:31:27,110
Can I get out of here?

3595
02:31:28,090 --> 02:31:29,690
I'm not gonna count in here?!

3596
02:31:30,090 --> 02:31:30,890
Oh my god.

3597
02:31:44,720 --> 02:31:45,720
One Mississippi.

3598
02:31:46,180 --> 02:31:47,340
Two Mississippi.

3599
02:31:47,720 --> 02:31:48,800
Three Mississippi.

3600
02:31:49,180 --> 02:31:50,320
Four Mississippi.

3601
02:31:50,820 --> 02:31:51,860
Five Mississippi.

3602
02:31:54,180 --> 02:31:54,260
Ten.

3603
02:32:15,580 --> 02:32:16,840
I don't like this.

3604
02:32:17,080 --> 02:32:19,400
I don't like Mike because he's an asshole to us.

3605
02:32:19,860 --> 02:32:20,900
Is he like outside?

3606
02:32:21,320 --> 02:32:22,280
Is he in the shed?

3607
02:32:22,480 --> 02:32:22,880
You think?

3608
02:32:23,900 --> 02:32:25,080
You think he's like out here?

3609
02:32:26,120 --> 02:32:27,660
Just take his car and go home?

3610
02:32:27,740 --> 02:32:28,360
Yeah, for real.

3611
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:29,960
Anybody in the windows?

3612
02:32:30,560 --> 02:32:31,260
You in here?

3613
02:32:32,780 --> 02:32:34,740
Why is the music so scary?

3614
02:32:36,380 --> 02:32:38,500
Why is the music so scary?

3615
02:32:39,480 --> 02:32:40,200
Why is the music so scary?

3616
02:32:40,200 --> 02:32:40,260
What is this?

3617
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:44,620
In the fridge.

3618
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:46,940
Ice zone.

3619
02:32:47,440 --> 02:32:48,400
He's in the oven?

3620
02:32:48,860 --> 02:32:49,760
I wish.

3621
02:32:50,940 --> 02:32:52,540
Oh my god, the bear scared me.

3622
02:32:52,860 --> 02:32:53,900
Oh gosh.

3623
02:32:57,260 --> 02:32:58,940
Is there gonna be someone actually...

3624
02:33:00,060 --> 02:33:01,060
The door is shut.

3625
02:33:03,380 --> 02:33:04,340
The door is shut.

3626
02:33:04,380 --> 02:33:04,940
The door is shut.

3627
02:33:04,980 --> 02:33:05,560
The door is shut.

3628
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:05,860
The door is shut.

3629
02:33:12,070 --> 02:33:12,890
He's on the deck.

3630
02:33:14,490 --> 02:33:15,250
No, he's not.

3631
02:33:20,800 --> 02:33:22,800
This is the chiller.

3632
02:33:23,620 --> 02:33:25,020
I'm not even saying it.

3633
02:33:26,580 --> 02:33:28,420
I'm gonna cancel your DS order.

3634
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:29,960
That's what I'm gonna do.

3635
02:33:30,780 --> 02:33:31,880
I'm gonna cancel it.

3636
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:33,880
You won't have it.

3637
02:33:36,240 --> 02:33:37,920
You won't get that DS.

3638
02:33:38,460 --> 02:33:44,060
You won't get that DS.

3639
02:33:44,780 --> 02:33:45,660
You won't get that DS.

3640
02:33:52,650 --> 02:33:53,750
Oh my god.

3641
02:33:59,800 --> 02:34:00,660
Oh, got you.

3642
02:34:01,940 --> 02:34:02,480
Wait, what?

3643
02:34:03,860 --> 02:34:04,700
Hang on, Harp.

3644
02:34:04,720 --> 02:34:05,740
I think I hear something upstairs.

3645
02:34:06,440 --> 02:34:07,720
See, I'm not talking.

3646
02:34:07,940 --> 02:34:09,960
I'm gonna mute myself and you'll see how loud it is still.

3647
02:34:14,340 --> 02:34:14,780
I'm gonna mute myself and you'll see how loud it is still.

3648
02:34:14,780 --> 02:34:17,720
I have to mute the game as well.

3649
02:34:17,900 --> 02:34:18,300
I'm sorry.

3650
02:34:18,460 --> 02:34:20,600
I didn't realize I was using the wrong mic.

3651
02:34:22,160 --> 02:34:22,880
Hang on, Harp.

3652
02:34:22,900 --> 02:34:24,220
I think I heard something upstairs.

3653
02:34:25,180 --> 02:34:26,560
Fool me once, shame on you.

3654
02:34:26,660 --> 02:34:29,280
Fool me twice, you're gonna try this again?

3655
02:34:29,400 --> 02:34:30,160
Yeah, you're gonna try this again?

3656
02:34:30,160 --> 02:34:30,860
No kidding, Sydney.

3657
02:34:31,220 --> 02:34:33,120
I really heard something sliding up there.

3658
02:34:34,380 --> 02:34:35,260
You didn't hear it?

3659
02:34:36,820 --> 02:34:37,180
No.

3660
02:34:37,900 --> 02:34:39,560
I swear on my life I heard something.

3661
02:34:42,220 --> 02:34:45,460
I see the attic access door is... a door in here.

3662
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:55,620
Why are we just standing here?

3663
02:34:59,020 --> 02:34:59,460
What?

3664
02:35:03,840 --> 02:35:04,720
Excuse me?

3665
02:35:07,660 --> 02:35:09,140
Yeah, you're taller than me.

3666
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:09,640
Why don't you go?

3667
02:35:10,060 --> 02:35:13,180
I think my shoulders are too broad to fit through there, Sydney.

3668
02:35:13,180 --> 02:35:15,400
But one of us really should look.

3669
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:18,680
Where are you hiding these broad shoulders?

3670
02:35:18,780 --> 02:35:19,600
Yeah, you tell him, Sydney.

3671
02:35:20,340 --> 02:35:21,240
Seriously, Sydney.

3672
02:35:21,320 --> 02:35:22,400
I don't think I would fit through.

3673
02:35:24,060 --> 02:35:27,480
Use the step stool behind you and climb up.

3674
02:35:34,830 --> 02:35:35,370
Use the step stool behind you and climb up.

3675
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:40,470
I wish every bad thing upon you ever, ever in your life.

3676
02:35:40,630 --> 02:35:40,730
I wish every bad thing upon you ever, ever in your life.

3677
02:35:41,030 --> 02:35:41,570
Michael.

3678
02:35:41,890 --> 02:35:42,750
Michael Carter.

3679
02:35:43,030 --> 02:35:45,490
Sorry if your name is Michael Carter in the chat.

3680
02:35:46,210 --> 02:35:47,790
What is this?

3681
02:35:48,490 --> 02:35:50,250
This guy is the worst ever.

3682
02:36:04,160 --> 02:36:05,560
Do not shut the door on me.

3683
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:06,900
Do not do that.

3684
02:36:08,360 --> 02:36:09,220
Oh my god.

3685
02:36:11,360 --> 02:36:13,960
There's gonna be someone up there and then I'm gonna have to...

3686
02:36:13,960 --> 02:36:15,740
Why am I quiet in the closet?

3687
02:36:18,460 --> 02:36:19,920
At least I can turn the light on.

3688
02:36:24,040 --> 02:36:25,040
I'm too scared.

3689
02:36:25,160 --> 02:36:25,780
I'm too scared.

3690
02:36:25,780 --> 02:36:26,460
I'm too scared.

3691
02:36:26,520 --> 02:36:26,880
He lies.

3692
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:34,180
Couldn't reach without...

3693
02:36:34,180 --> 02:36:34,860
I'm on the step stool.

3694
02:36:36,200 --> 02:36:37,220
No, I'm on it.

3695
02:36:49,560 --> 02:36:50,920
Oh my god.

3696
02:37:00,220 --> 02:37:01,520
Oh, it's a cat.

3697
02:37:04,280 --> 02:37:06,040
Oh, it's just a cat.

3698
02:37:06,480 --> 02:37:08,260
In someone else's bed.

3699
02:37:08,740 --> 02:37:10,960
And clothes that are drying.

3700
02:37:11,060 --> 02:37:12,240
But mostly a cat.

3701
02:37:13,240 --> 02:37:14,600
It's just a cat.

3702
02:37:15,020 --> 02:37:15,620
It's just a cat.

3703
02:37:17,340 --> 02:37:18,900
And no one else in this corner.

3704
02:37:21,240 --> 02:37:22,640
You can pet the cat.

3705
02:37:24,700 --> 02:37:25,640
You gonna come with?

3706
02:37:27,180 --> 02:37:28,060
Come on.

3707
02:37:29,220 --> 02:37:31,000
Thanks for keeping that in the attic.

3708
02:37:31,300 --> 02:37:31,960
Come on, cat.

3709
02:37:49,580 --> 02:37:50,580
Sydney, are you okay?

3710
02:37:50,580 --> 02:37:51,600
What was up there?

3711
02:37:56,440 --> 02:37:59,080
Looks like you aren't the only...

3712
02:37:59,080 --> 02:38:00,840
pussy cat in the house.

3713
02:38:02,900 --> 02:38:04,320
I don't think he liked that.

3714
02:38:05,420 --> 02:38:06,440
What do you mean by that?

3715
02:38:06,700 --> 02:38:07,840
It was just a cat.

3716
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:09,740
Oh, that's a relief.

3717
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:11,580
I was worried there for a minute.

3718
02:38:11,620 --> 02:38:12,900
But why is a cat in the attic?

3719
02:38:14,540 --> 02:38:15,740
I think she was hungry.

3720
02:38:16,380 --> 02:38:16,980
Oh yeah?

3721
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:18,580
Maybe we can give her one of the carp after.

3722
02:38:19,020 --> 02:38:20,340
I come find you again.

3723
02:38:20,480 --> 02:38:20,640
What?

3724
02:38:23,300 --> 02:38:23,700
What?

3725
02:38:24,840 --> 02:38:26,840
I decided to hide in the tool shed...

3726
02:38:26,840 --> 02:38:27,280
in the backyard.

3727
02:38:29,360 --> 02:38:29,760
Okay...

3728
02:38:33,340 --> 02:38:34,640
I guess I decided...

3729
02:38:34,640 --> 02:38:35,140
to do that.

3730
02:38:38,840 --> 02:38:40,100
I guess that's better than...

3731
02:38:40,100 --> 02:38:40,580
the basement.

3732
02:38:41,860 --> 02:38:43,380
Okay, we're hiding in the tool shed.

3733
02:38:44,840 --> 02:38:45,920
Why are we still...

3734
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:46,620
doing this?

3735
02:38:46,820 --> 02:38:48,020
Wait, I should shut the door.

3736
02:38:48,100 --> 02:38:48,400
Shouldn't I?

3737
02:38:50,420 --> 02:38:52,080
This makes no sense.

3738
02:38:52,280 --> 02:38:52,720
I know.

3739
02:38:53,080 --> 02:38:54,260
This is so...

3740
02:38:54,260 --> 02:38:54,580
bizarre.

3741
02:38:54,900 --> 02:38:56,060
This is not what like...

3742
02:38:56,060 --> 02:38:58,120
adults do on their...

3743
02:38:58,120 --> 02:38:58,840
time off.

3744
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:00,400
Like...

3745
02:39:01,880 --> 02:39:03,280
This is so weird.

3746
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,180
Do I just chill here?

3747
02:39:19,050 --> 02:39:20,170
You do this all...

3748
02:39:20,170 --> 02:39:20,430
the time?

3749
02:39:20,910 --> 02:39:22,030
Maybe I believe you.

3750
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:28,720
I can't... Oh.

3751
02:39:38,020 --> 02:39:38,700
Where is he going?

3752
02:39:42,220 --> 02:39:43,480
I think he can see me.

3753
02:39:46,760 --> 02:39:47,880
Did you see that?

3754
02:39:48,380 --> 02:39:49,600
Did you see there was something...

3755
02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:50,320
walking in the house?

3756
02:39:54,040 --> 02:39:54,960
Oh, that was subtle.

3757
02:39:56,560 --> 02:39:57,480
Oh, Mike!

3758
02:39:58,980 --> 02:39:59,680
Mike, I think...

3759
02:39:59,680 --> 02:39:59,980
we're in trouble.

3760
02:40:00,080 --> 02:40:01,380
Wait, I think my computer's in trouble.

3761
02:40:02,020 --> 02:40:03,500
Uh, my wallpaper...

3762
02:40:03,500 --> 02:40:04,520
engine is glitching out.

3763
02:40:09,550 --> 02:40:09,950
Aha!

3764
02:40:10,190 --> 02:40:10,930
There you are!

3765
02:40:12,790 --> 02:40:13,190
Wait!

3766
02:40:13,310 --> 02:40:13,990
We're not gonna...

3767
02:40:13,990 --> 02:40:14,690
say anything about it?

3768
02:40:15,010 --> 02:40:15,730
Damn, Harp.

3769
02:40:15,730 --> 02:40:16,050
It took...

3770
02:40:16,110 --> 02:40:17,810
me a while to figure out you left the house.

3771
02:40:18,530 --> 02:40:19,970
Anything worth doing is worth...

3772
02:40:19,970 --> 02:40:20,330
doing well.

3773
02:40:21,510 --> 02:40:22,210
My turn!

3774
02:40:22,430 --> 02:40:23,690
Close those pretty eyes now.

3775
02:40:23,890 --> 02:40:24,590
I'm getting tired.

3776
02:40:25,510 --> 02:40:26,750
Look, I'll hide in the house.

3777
02:40:26,850 --> 02:40:27,770
We're headed back in anyway.

3778
02:40:27,970 --> 02:40:29,210
You find me and we'll go to bed.

3779
02:40:31,090 --> 02:40:31,530
Nooooooo!

3780
02:40:35,250 --> 02:40:35,690
Nooooooo!

3781
02:40:44,420 --> 02:40:44,860
Nooooooo!

3782
02:40:47,020 --> 02:40:48,740
I don't think we'll find Mike.

3783
02:40:48,940 --> 02:40:50,620
I don't think we'll find Mike.

3784
02:40:50,620 --> 02:40:52,240
Where's Nora getting here?

3785
02:40:55,620 --> 02:40:56,060
One...

3786
02:40:56,060 --> 02:40:58,120
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

3787
02:41:06,570 --> 02:41:08,130
Oh, stuck on the fishing rod.

3788
02:41:13,280 --> 02:41:14,160
Oh, golly.

3789
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:16,000
Gosh, gosh, gosh, gosh.

3790
02:41:16,120 --> 02:41:17,220
I don't like this at all.

3791
02:41:19,720 --> 02:41:21,060
But there's someone in here!

3792
02:41:21,440 --> 02:41:21,620
But there's someone in here!

3793
02:41:26,260 --> 02:41:27,860
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

3794
02:41:29,260 --> 02:41:30,560
Please close the door.

3795
02:41:40,240 --> 02:41:41,820
I feel nervous.

3796
02:41:51,680 --> 02:41:52,560
What's that sound?

3797
02:41:59,670 --> 02:42:00,570
What's that sound?

3798
02:42:18,650 --> 02:42:19,610
Oh, gosh.

3799
02:42:20,070 --> 02:42:21,470
Nothing in here, right?

3800
02:42:23,990 --> 02:42:24,470
Upstairs?

3801
02:42:24,590 --> 02:42:26,350
I know where I need to go!

3802
02:42:26,610 --> 02:42:26,950
Okay!

3803
02:42:27,930 --> 02:42:29,750
I know where I need to go!

3804
02:42:29,890 --> 02:42:30,810
I just don't want to!

3805
02:42:32,550 --> 02:42:33,870
What if I keep the door open?

3806
02:42:41,100 --> 02:42:42,440
All the doors...

3807
02:42:42,440 --> 02:42:43,840
All the doors are open, so...

3808
02:42:46,980 --> 02:42:48,380
Are you including that one?

3809
02:42:49,560 --> 02:42:49,720
Are you including that one?

3810
02:42:49,720 --> 02:42:50,140
Are you including that one?

3811
02:42:54,820 --> 02:42:55,520
In here?

3812
02:42:58,260 --> 02:42:59,480
Oh, my God!

3813
02:43:00,940 --> 02:43:01,700
Oh, my God!

3814
02:43:03,260 --> 02:43:04,020
What's going on?

3815
02:43:04,040 --> 02:43:04,420
What happened?

3816
02:43:04,760 --> 02:43:06,420
Well, hey there!

3817
02:43:09,040 --> 02:43:11,000
Why the hell are you in here again?

3818
02:43:11,280 --> 02:43:11,360
Why the hell are you in here again?

3819
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:13,740
I'm fixing the faucet.

3820
02:43:14,080 --> 02:43:15,380
You got a problem with that?

3821
02:43:15,380 --> 02:43:17,120
You should have told us!

3822
02:43:17,900 --> 02:43:19,420
Miss, this is my house.

3823
02:43:19,560 --> 02:43:22,440
I don't need to check in with you every time I fix something.

3824
02:43:22,900 --> 02:43:23,960
I don't need to check in with you every time I fix something.

3825
02:43:23,960 --> 02:43:26,660
I've never seen anyone fix a faucet with a hammer before.

3826
02:43:27,100 --> 02:43:27,420
I've never seen anyone fix a faucet with a hammer before.

3827
02:43:27,480 --> 02:43:28,880
Ooh, you tell him.

3828
02:43:29,060 --> 02:43:32,440
You didn't ever fix many faucets yourself, young man!

3829
02:43:33,840 --> 02:43:35,240
Rick is kind of sassy.

3830
02:43:35,520 --> 02:43:36,220
Fake Rick.

3831
02:43:36,800 --> 02:43:37,720
Didn't think so.

3832
02:43:38,120 --> 02:43:40,820
I'd imagine you don't know what tools you need.

3833
02:43:41,640 --> 02:43:43,040
How long have you been here?

3834
02:43:43,540 --> 02:43:45,200
Just got here a couple minutes ago.

3835
02:43:46,360 --> 02:43:46,980
He was...

3836
02:43:46,980 --> 02:43:47,620
It came from the...

3837
02:43:47,620 --> 02:43:49,180
He walked from the right, though, right?

3838
02:43:49,260 --> 02:43:50,480
So he was in the basement, I think.

3839
02:43:53,940 --> 02:43:56,660
If you heard anything before that, it must have been that old lady.

3840
02:43:56,780 --> 02:43:57,120
Remember?

3841
02:44:00,240 --> 02:44:00,600
Um...

3842
02:44:00,600 --> 02:44:02,080
Look, we need to go to bed now.

3843
02:44:02,900 --> 02:44:04,380
You asking me to leave, miss?

3844
02:44:05,020 --> 02:44:05,380
Yes!

3845
02:44:06,780 --> 02:44:09,900
We're paying $100 a night to be here!

3846
02:44:12,660 --> 02:44:13,020
We're paying $100 a night to be here!

3847
02:44:13,020 --> 02:44:13,300
You're being too polite.

3848
02:44:13,500 --> 02:44:16,000
We rented this house and would like to have it to ourselves.

3849
02:44:16,360 --> 02:44:16,840
I...

3850
02:44:16,840 --> 02:44:19,900
We don't really want to have to call law enforcement.

3851
02:44:20,880 --> 02:44:21,800
Mike, please.

3852
02:44:21,960 --> 02:44:22,520
Actually, no.

3853
02:44:22,640 --> 02:44:23,560
Let Mike handle this.

3854
02:44:29,940 --> 02:44:32,360
Ain't no cops in Woodbury, son.

3855
02:44:32,620 --> 02:44:34,020
That is an absolute lie.

3856
02:44:34,140 --> 02:44:36,720
I've seen like three cop cars drive by the house.

3857
02:44:37,100 --> 02:44:38,500
I almost ran into one!

3858
02:44:38,840 --> 02:44:39,580
What are you talking about?

3859
02:44:39,620 --> 02:44:40,720
There's no cops in Woodbury.

3860
02:44:41,700 --> 02:44:45,800
You think they're going to arrest the homeowner for fixing the faucet?

3861
02:44:45,820 --> 02:44:48,180
I was just doing some work.

3862
02:44:48,400 --> 02:44:51,160
If you can't handle that, it's your problem.

3863
02:44:51,340 --> 02:44:52,160
Not mine.

3864
02:44:53,320 --> 02:44:54,240
You know what?

3865
02:44:54,740 --> 02:44:58,500
If you folks don't like me fixing the faucet, I'll leave you to it.

3866
02:44:59,400 --> 02:45:01,160
Yeah, let us fix it.

3867
02:45:01,340 --> 02:45:03,100
We don't need this anyway.

3868
02:45:03,380 --> 02:45:04,440
The tap didn't work.

3869
02:45:04,520 --> 02:45:05,420
Wow, it really is broken.

3870
02:45:08,800 --> 02:45:09,300
Okay.

3871
02:45:10,280 --> 02:45:12,660
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

3872
02:45:13,760 --> 02:45:14,260
Ricky?

3873
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:17,560
That's right.

3874
02:45:17,920 --> 02:45:18,580
Good night.

3875
02:45:21,800 --> 02:45:23,280
It actually is broken.

3876
02:45:24,160 --> 02:45:25,660
Maybe this guy is legit.

3877
02:45:29,700 --> 02:45:30,540
Is that it?

3878
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:34,840
After locking the door, we debated what to do.

3879
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:37,560
We agreed that there was something off about Rick from the start.

3880
02:45:37,740 --> 02:45:40,880
It seemed like he enjoyed making excuses to come over unannounced.

3881
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:42,160
He wants to catch us naked.

3882
02:45:42,160 --> 02:45:45,660
In the end, we decided Rick was weird but probably harmless.

3883
02:45:46,040 --> 02:45:49,620
We attributed his behavior to an extreme lack of social awareness.

3884
02:45:51,160 --> 02:45:52,680
I think he broke it.

3885
02:45:52,780 --> 02:45:53,700
Maybe he broke it?

3886
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:53,980
Maybe.

3887
02:45:54,980 --> 02:45:56,920
Look, we already drove all the way out here.

3888
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:58,520
Let's just enjoy ourselves, Mike said.

3889
02:45:58,760 --> 02:46:00,820
But by this time, I was feeling really tired.

3890
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:02,400
I decided to get some rest.

3891
02:46:04,960 --> 02:46:06,400
11.39 pm.

3892
02:46:08,060 --> 02:46:08,540
No!

3893
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:09,520
No!

3894
02:46:09,520 --> 02:46:09,720
Hello?

3895
02:46:11,800 --> 02:46:12,580
What's going on?

3896
02:46:16,540 --> 02:46:17,240
What's that sound?

3897
02:46:21,160 --> 02:46:22,380
I still have the flashlight.

3898
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:27,700
Could not go back to sleep with those knocks at my door.

3899
02:46:29,040 --> 02:46:29,440
Hello?

3900
02:46:31,400 --> 02:46:32,040
Who is it?

3901
02:46:32,180 --> 02:46:32,200
Oh.

3902
02:46:34,500 --> 02:46:36,460
Not even the flashlight worked.

3903
02:46:39,420 --> 02:46:39,820
Harp?

3904
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:40,560
Are you still awake?

3905
02:46:42,140 --> 02:46:43,060
He's knocking on my door.

3906
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:47,280
My extreme lack of social awareness.

3907
02:46:47,460 --> 02:46:48,860
Like someone else I know.

3908
02:46:50,800 --> 02:46:52,040
Do you mind if I come in?

3909
02:46:52,260 --> 02:46:53,460
I'd like to talk about something.

3910
02:46:54,820 --> 02:46:56,200
At 4 in the morning?

3911
02:47:01,160 --> 02:47:01,720
Didn't the...

3912
02:47:01,720 --> 02:47:03,340
It said 4 in the morning, right?

3913
02:47:03,460 --> 02:47:04,100
Or am I crazy?

3914
02:47:04,380 --> 02:47:04,780
Sure?

3915
02:47:08,840 --> 02:47:09,840
Yeah, 4.30.

3916
02:47:10,720 --> 02:47:12,360
The storm is starting to get really bad.

3917
02:47:12,460 --> 02:47:13,960
I can hardly see the truck in the driveway.

3918
02:47:15,240 --> 02:47:17,260
I hate that Nora is out there all alone.

3919
02:47:18,440 --> 02:47:19,660
She'll be just fine, Sydney.

3920
02:47:20,980 --> 02:47:21,540
Don't worry.

3921
02:47:21,820 --> 02:47:23,480
I'm here to keep you safe.

3922
02:47:29,030 --> 02:47:30,330
That's nice of you, Mike.

3923
02:47:31,950 --> 02:47:32,350
Okay.

3924
02:47:33,030 --> 02:47:34,270
Hey, it's no problem at all.

3925
02:47:35,330 --> 02:47:38,710
Guys are supposed to watch over people they care about, right?

3926
02:47:41,450 --> 02:47:42,390
What are you talking about?

3927
02:47:42,870 --> 02:47:43,690
What a day, huh?

3928
02:47:45,230 --> 02:47:47,810
This wasn't exactly how I thought our getaway was going to be.

3929
02:47:48,330 --> 02:47:49,010
I'm going to go, Sydney.

3930
02:47:51,910 --> 02:47:53,890
It's been a strange day.

3931
02:47:54,650 --> 02:47:56,450
Can you believe that guy?

3932
02:47:56,610 --> 02:47:59,210
He just keeps wandering around the house like he owns the place.

3933
02:48:00,030 --> 02:48:01,470
Yeah, he does own the place.

3934
02:48:02,630 --> 02:48:04,130
You know exactly what I meant, Sydney.

3935
02:48:04,310 --> 02:48:07,190
He shouldn't just barge in the place whenever he wants.

3936
02:48:07,390 --> 02:48:08,810
We rented the damn house.

3937
02:48:10,110 --> 02:48:12,630
I mean, the guy is probably harmless, but I'm frustrated.

3938
02:48:14,830 --> 02:48:17,450
You've also been a little difficult to deal with.

3939
02:48:18,330 --> 02:48:19,730
Maybe I shouldn't provoke him.

3940
02:48:19,830 --> 02:48:20,230
I don't know.

3941
02:48:23,670 --> 02:48:24,410
You're right, Sydney.

3942
02:48:24,870 --> 02:48:25,650
I'm really sorry.

3943
02:48:27,690 --> 02:48:28,150
It's okay.

3944
02:48:34,800 --> 02:48:36,700
Why don't you come sit by me, Sydney?

3945
02:48:40,680 --> 02:48:41,040
Mikey?

3946
02:48:46,250 --> 02:48:46,610
Mikey?

3947
02:48:46,990 --> 02:48:48,250
I don't want to sit on the bed.

3948
02:48:49,110 --> 02:48:50,250
I don't want to sit on the bed.

3949
02:48:51,590 --> 02:48:53,050
Mikey, I don't want to sit on the bed.

3950
02:48:58,490 --> 02:48:59,910
Leaving me already, Sydney?

3951
02:49:02,410 --> 02:49:04,230
I don't want to sit on the bed.

3952
02:49:04,230 --> 02:49:05,190
I don't want to sit on

3953
02:49:10,500 --> 02:49:10,580
the bed.

3954
02:49:10,820 --> 02:49:11,300
I don't want to sit on the bed.

3955
02:49:11,300 --> 02:49:18,160
Mikey, I thought you were awkward, but I was on your side for the long time, Mikey.

3956
02:49:23,850 --> 02:49:25,030
No, no, no.

3957
02:49:26,870 --> 02:49:30,530
Harp, you know, I've missed this.

3958
02:49:30,670 --> 02:49:30,870
I've missed this.

3959
02:49:32,130 --> 02:49:33,290
Us just talking.

3960
02:49:33,550 --> 02:49:34,750
It's been too long.

3961
02:49:39,660 --> 02:49:40,420
Nobody's talking.

3962
02:49:40,680 --> 02:49:40,920
Nobody's talking.

3963
02:49:41,980 --> 02:49:44,000
Do you think Nora didn't come on purpose?

3964
02:49:44,500 --> 02:49:47,740
Do you think Nora is actually coming?

3965
02:49:48,340 --> 02:49:49,200
Do you think Nora is actually coming?

3966
02:49:50,020 --> 02:49:54,000
You know, you don't have to sleep alone tonight if you don't want to.

3967
02:49:57,420 --> 02:49:59,800
Would you be doing this if Nora was here?

3968
02:50:05,150 --> 02:50:05,630
What?

3969
02:50:07,690 --> 02:50:08,170
What?

3970
02:50:08,170 --> 02:50:08,910
Oh!

3971
02:50:11,810 --> 02:50:14,070
You act like you don't remember our trip to Oregon.

3972
02:50:15,010 --> 02:50:15,650
Uh-oh.

3973
02:50:17,530 --> 02:50:19,510
I remember it being pretty awkward.

3974
02:50:20,970 --> 02:50:22,670
It didn't start out awkward, though.

3975
02:50:23,430 --> 02:50:25,010
Mike, we had a lot to drink.

3976
02:50:25,810 --> 02:50:26,770
Things happened.

3977
02:50:28,310 --> 02:50:29,250
They sure did.

3978
02:50:31,430 --> 02:50:33,250
I'm hoping maybe they can happen again.

3979
02:50:34,170 --> 02:50:35,070
Oh, gosh.

3980
02:50:35,070 --> 02:50:36,950
Oh, Mike.

3981
02:50:37,490 --> 02:50:39,370
Oh, Mike.

3982
02:50:39,490 --> 02:50:40,290
I don't know what to say.

3983
02:50:41,670 --> 02:50:44,710
You just let me worry about the details, Sydney.

3984
02:50:45,210 --> 02:50:45,770
Oh!

3985
02:50:47,770 --> 02:50:49,190
What's, what's, what's...

3986
02:50:49,810 --> 02:50:50,370
Guys?

3987
02:50:51,130 --> 02:50:57,210
I think I'm about 70 miles away from Woodbury and my stinking tire just blew out.

3988
02:50:57,730 --> 02:51:02,470
It's snowing and I'm on the side of the road on Highway 11 near Killington.

3989
02:51:02,730 --> 02:51:04,610
There's a sign by the side of the road.

3990
02:51:05,070 --> 02:51:06,070
It's hard to see.

3991
02:51:06,210 --> 02:51:09,270
I think it says Kent Pond.

3992
02:51:09,670 --> 02:51:14,850
The snow is like half a foot deep and I can't get the lug nuts off the tire.

3993
02:51:16,690 --> 02:51:20,530
I hate to ask, but can you two come get me?

3994
02:51:21,170 --> 02:51:21,650
Okay!

3995
02:51:21,790 --> 02:51:22,350
S.O.S.

3996
02:51:22,370 --> 02:51:22,790
S.O.S.

3997
02:51:22,890 --> 02:51:24,990
We are on our way.

3998
02:51:25,310 --> 02:51:27,250
Bibigirl, don't you worry.

3999
02:51:27,370 --> 02:51:30,630
We're coming right now, right on over.

4000
02:51:36,760 --> 02:51:38,380
We gotta go save Nora.

4001
02:51:40,160 --> 02:51:40,560
Right?

4002
02:51:43,140 --> 02:51:44,260
What a timing, huh?

4003
02:51:44,500 --> 02:51:46,320
I guess we can't leave Nora stranded.

4004
02:51:47,540 --> 02:51:48,240
No, we can't.

4005
02:51:48,280 --> 02:51:48,900
We better get ready.

4006
02:51:51,320 --> 02:51:51,920
No, Sydney.

4007
02:51:52,100 --> 02:51:53,460
You stay here and get some sleep.

4008
02:51:53,620 --> 02:51:56,080
There's no sense in both of us freezing our asses off.

4009
02:51:56,580 --> 02:51:56,980
What?

4010
02:51:58,340 --> 02:51:58,740
No!

4011
02:51:58,740 --> 02:51:59,140
No!

4012
02:52:00,620 --> 02:52:01,020
No!

4013
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:02,400
No!

4014
02:52:02,460 --> 02:52:02,620
No!

4015
02:52:02,720 --> 02:52:02,840
No!

4016
02:52:02,840 --> 02:52:03,040
No!

4017
02:52:03,040 --> 02:52:03,260
No!

4018
02:52:03,460 --> 02:52:03,540
No!

4019
02:52:03,660 --> 02:52:03,740
No!

4020
02:52:03,880 --> 02:52:03,980
No!

4021
02:52:04,160 --> 02:52:04,560
No!

4022
02:52:04,600 --> 02:52:05,000
No!

4023
02:52:05,220 --> 02:52:05,620
No!

4024
02:52:05,620 --> 02:52:07,760
Can I have an option to say no?

4025
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:10,120
No!

4026
02:52:10,280 --> 02:52:10,660
No!

4027
02:52:10,660 --> 02:52:11,200
Mikey, please!

4028
02:52:12,500 --> 02:52:13,380
Are you sure?

4029
02:52:13,560 --> 02:52:14,140
Yeah, I'm sure.

4030
02:52:14,260 --> 02:52:16,200
You're in pajamas and I'm still dressed.

4031
02:52:16,420 --> 02:52:18,180
You just settle in and I'll go help Nora.

4032
02:52:18,380 --> 02:52:19,940
That's really nice, Mike!

4033
02:52:22,700 --> 02:52:28,220
Can we please remember that there is a guy who keeps barging into our home?

4034
02:52:30,320 --> 02:52:33,140
I always like doing nice things for you, Sydney.

4035
02:52:40,560 --> 02:52:41,740
Let's split up, gang!

4036
02:52:41,980 --> 02:52:42,220
No!

4037
02:52:42,280 --> 02:52:43,820
This is the worst idea!

4038
02:52:44,120 --> 02:52:44,500
Please!

4039
02:52:45,640 --> 02:52:47,740
We'll finish talking about this later, okay?

4040
02:52:47,820 --> 02:52:49,760
Get some good rest and stay warm.

4041
02:52:53,740 --> 02:52:54,140
Oh!

4042
02:52:57,720 --> 02:52:58,120
No!

4043
02:53:00,760 --> 02:53:01,520
I'm coming with.

4044
02:53:01,620 --> 02:53:02,040
I'm coming with.

4045
02:53:02,100 --> 02:53:02,560
I'm coming with.

4046
02:53:02,600 --> 02:53:03,080
I'm coming with.

4047
02:53:03,120 --> 02:53:03,620
I'm coming with.

4048
02:53:03,660 --> 02:53:04,160
I'm coming with.

4049
02:53:04,200 --> 02:53:04,660
I'm coming with.

4050
02:53:07,220 --> 02:53:08,340
The door's not opening.

4051
02:53:09,260 --> 02:53:10,380
And my flashlight's gone.

4052
02:53:10,560 --> 02:53:11,160
I'm coming with.

4053
02:53:11,280 --> 02:53:11,900
I'm coming with.

4054
02:53:12,380 --> 02:53:13,320
It's freezing cold outside.

4055
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:15,720
It's okay.

4056
02:53:15,780 --> 02:53:16,260
I'm in my pajamas.

4057
02:53:16,480 --> 02:53:16,780
It's fine.

4058
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:22,080
There's no sense in both of us freezing our asses off.

4059
02:53:22,380 --> 02:53:23,440
Please, no, Mikey!

4060
02:53:23,720 --> 02:53:25,420
I won't let you go!

4061
02:53:26,520 --> 02:53:27,060
Please!

4062
02:53:29,020 --> 02:53:29,560
Please!

4063
02:53:29,600 --> 02:53:30,480
I'm sorry!

4064
02:53:32,160 --> 02:53:34,520
Joy, thank you for the Hakosufa!

4065
02:53:34,980 --> 02:53:36,020
No, Mikey!

4066
02:53:36,580 --> 02:53:37,480
Mikey, please!

4067
02:53:37,560 --> 02:53:38,440
I love this truck!

4068
02:53:38,780 --> 02:53:39,960
I love this truck!

4069
02:53:40,080 --> 02:53:40,320
Please!

4070
02:53:42,420 --> 02:53:42,840
No!

4071
02:53:48,480 --> 02:53:50,900
Are you sure it's safe to drive in this weather?

4072
02:53:51,320 --> 02:53:52,960
Oh, why don't you get some rest while I'm gone?

4073
02:53:53,440 --> 02:53:55,020
Don't worry, I've driven and worse.

4074
02:53:55,640 --> 02:53:58,000
Besides, Nora's probably freaking out more than you right now.

4075
02:53:58,100 --> 02:53:58,520
No!

4076
02:53:58,760 --> 02:53:59,520
She's not!

4077
02:54:02,580 --> 02:54:05,040
Look, make sure you take care of yourself, alright?

4078
02:54:05,240 --> 02:54:06,340
Lock all the doors!

4079
02:54:07,920 --> 02:54:08,340
Yes!

4080
02:54:08,400 --> 02:54:09,600
You sound like my dad.

4081
02:54:09,600 --> 02:54:10,720
Can you blame me?

4082
02:54:11,280 --> 02:54:13,540
Before I go, how about a hug?

4083
02:54:25,090 --> 02:54:27,870
I mean, just in case you're asleep when I get back.

4084
02:54:28,070 --> 02:54:29,650
I kinda need one right now.

4085
02:54:41,470 --> 02:54:42,690
Where's my hug at?

4086
02:54:43,590 --> 02:54:44,950
Not now, Mike.

4087
02:54:46,090 --> 02:54:46,990
Sweet dreams!

4088
02:54:47,130 --> 02:54:48,390
Get some sleep, Cindy!

4089
02:54:52,410 --> 02:54:53,590
Mikey, please!

4090
02:54:53,890 --> 02:54:54,570
Don't leave!

4091
02:54:57,270 --> 02:54:57,850
Please!

4092
02:55:08,760 --> 02:55:09,740
Let's go get her.

4093
02:55:09,980 --> 02:55:12,760
I was keen on getting some sleep until Mike and Nora arrived.

4094
02:55:13,600 --> 02:55:14,800
Where's my flashlight?

4095
02:55:16,420 --> 02:55:17,520
Where's the flashlight?

4096
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:19,600
Wait, actually, where's the flashlight?

4097
02:55:20,960 --> 02:55:22,120
Oh my god.

4098
02:55:24,160 --> 02:55:24,980
Oh my god.

4099
02:55:24,980 --> 02:55:25,020
Oh my god.

4100
02:55:27,480 --> 02:55:30,400
I told myself things would get better if I could just get some rest.

4101
02:55:30,660 --> 02:55:33,680
Nora always knew how to cheer me up and I needed it more by the minute.

4102
02:55:33,920 --> 02:55:36,300
With her arriving soon, I decided to rest in the meantime.

4103
02:55:41,120 --> 02:55:42,000
1239 AM!

4104
02:55:52,040 --> 02:55:52,880
Who's at the door?

4105
02:55:53,860 --> 02:55:54,300
Doorbell?

4106
02:55:55,940 --> 02:55:56,380
Doorbell?

4107
02:55:57,240 --> 02:55:58,520
Someone was at the front door.

4108
02:56:01,860 --> 02:56:02,880
Where's my flashlight?

4109
02:56:03,480 --> 02:56:04,280
Wait, for real?

4110
02:56:05,240 --> 02:56:05,800
It's gone.

4111
02:56:07,460 --> 02:56:08,860
Where did I drop it last?

4112
02:56:09,440 --> 02:56:10,260
Do you guys remember?

4113
02:56:10,560 --> 02:56:11,620
It was in the bedroom, wasn't it?

4114
02:56:23,260 --> 02:56:25,900
The realization that someone was outside this late at night was horrible.

4115
02:56:32,120 --> 02:56:33,360
Alert the hiker!

4116
02:56:35,400 --> 02:56:37,120
I saw you there, my friend.

4117
02:56:39,420 --> 02:56:40,660
Please open the door.

4118
02:56:40,740 --> 02:56:42,080
I'm freezing to death out here.

4119
02:56:54,350 --> 02:56:55,770
How did he find us?

4120
02:57:02,260 --> 02:57:03,800
Is the back door locked?

4121
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:05,160
I don't know how to lock it.

4122
02:57:06,060 --> 02:57:07,620
I can only know how to open it.

4123
02:57:09,440 --> 02:57:10,380
What do I do?

4124
02:57:13,820 --> 02:57:14,740
Get the gun?

4125
02:57:14,860 --> 02:57:15,220
What gun?

4126
02:57:15,500 --> 02:57:16,060
There's a gun?

4127
02:57:19,260 --> 02:57:20,020
What gun?

4128
02:57:27,210 --> 02:57:28,290
Can I get a knife?

4129
02:57:29,670 --> 02:57:30,890
I can't see anything.

4130
02:57:37,290 --> 02:57:38,890
If I open the door, do I die?

4131
02:57:45,390 --> 02:57:47,210
Do you have any idea what time it is?

4132
02:57:47,830 --> 02:57:52,790
Look friend, I know it ain't ideal banging on your door in the middle of the night, but I'm in a bad spot here.

4133
02:57:53,330 --> 02:57:58,290
I was counting on a ride from some friends, but they are running behind and won't be here for another...

4134
02:57:58,290 --> 02:58:00,750
About two more hours!

4135
02:58:02,910 --> 02:58:04,970
You can sit on the porch while you wait.

4136
02:58:06,170 --> 02:58:06,570
You can sit on the porch while you wait.

4137
02:58:06,570 --> 02:58:06,610
You can sit on the porch while you wait.

4138
02:58:06,610 --> 02:58:07,450
I'm not even going to say anything.

4139
02:58:07,610 --> 02:58:09,370
The weather outside is getting pretty bad.

4140
02:58:09,630 --> 02:58:13,190
I was hoping you'd be a friend and let me come inside to warm up.

4141
02:58:13,290 --> 02:58:13,490
I was hoping you'd be a friend and let me come inside to warm up.

4142
02:58:13,490 --> 02:58:14,830
Just until my friends get here.

4143
02:58:15,270 --> 02:58:16,810
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

4144
02:58:18,350 --> 02:58:19,950
Come on now, my friend.

4145
02:58:20,150 --> 02:58:24,190
If you were caught out in this blizzard, I'd give you a warm place to wait it out.

4146
02:58:24,430 --> 02:58:24,990
If you were caught out in this blizzard, I'd give you a warm place to wait it out.

4147
02:58:24,990 --> 02:58:26,510
You're not coming in, end of story.

4148
02:58:26,630 --> 02:58:27,890
Oh gosh, he's going to get angry.

4149
02:58:27,970 --> 02:58:28,270
He's going to get mad.

4150
02:58:28,290 --> 02:58:28,790
He's going to get angry.

4151
02:58:31,950 --> 02:58:33,030
Are you...

4152
02:58:33,730 --> 02:58:34,970
plucking kidding me?

4153
02:58:36,010 --> 02:58:38,410
You're going to let me freeze to death out here?

4154
02:58:39,650 --> 02:58:42,010
I should have known you'd be a big...

4155
02:58:42,010 --> 02:58:42,990
A big B?

4156
02:58:43,610 --> 02:58:44,530
Here is you.

4157
02:58:44,650 --> 02:58:46,290
We're back at the pizza joint.

4158
02:58:48,060 --> 02:58:51,730
You think I didn't see you and your little boyfriend fishing in the creek?

4159
02:58:51,890 --> 02:58:53,250
That was him!

4160
02:58:53,550 --> 02:58:56,010
Oh my gosh, that was him in the background.

4161
02:58:56,010 --> 02:58:59,390
I figured maybe you'd give me a chance this time.

4162
02:58:59,530 --> 02:59:01,210
But looks like you're still...

4163
02:59:02,390 --> 02:59:02,910
unkind.

4164
02:59:05,650 --> 02:59:07,370
Get out or I'll call the cops.

4165
02:59:07,790 --> 02:59:09,370
Ain't no cops around here.

4166
02:59:09,650 --> 02:59:12,510
Why are there not cops around here?

4167
02:59:12,990 --> 02:59:14,490
Why do you guys keep saying that?

4168
02:59:16,130 --> 02:59:17,170
Speaking of...

4169
02:59:20,190 --> 02:59:21,090
Wait, did I hear...

4170
02:59:21,090 --> 02:59:21,970
Do I hear like a...

4171
02:59:22,490 --> 02:59:23,230
like a...

4172
02:59:23,930 --> 02:59:24,450
sound?

4173
02:59:25,290 --> 02:59:26,670
Like the breaker or something?

4174
02:59:27,190 --> 02:59:29,450
I don't see your fella's truck out here either.

4175
02:59:29,630 --> 02:59:30,890
I'm dialing 911 now.

4176
02:59:31,390 --> 02:59:31,910
Fine.

4177
02:59:33,350 --> 02:59:34,210
Suit yourself.

4178
02:59:37,350 --> 02:59:39,810
But the lights are working.

4179
02:59:40,230 --> 02:59:40,950
I think.

4180
02:59:41,730 --> 02:59:42,790
Actually I can't tell.

4181
02:59:43,370 --> 02:59:44,790
If I turn this on...

4182
02:59:45,590 --> 02:59:46,110
Okay.

4183
02:59:47,030 --> 02:59:47,970
What do I do?

4184
02:59:49,350 --> 02:59:50,430
Where do I...

4185
02:59:52,230 --> 02:59:53,650
But let me tell you something.

4186
02:59:55,950 --> 02:59:57,190
You'll get what's coming...

4187
02:59:57,190 --> 02:59:58,650
Why did the door open?

4188
02:59:59,210 --> 03:00:00,510
You'll get what's coming...

4189
03:00:00,510 --> 03:00:01,990
to you for leaving me out here?

4190
03:00:03,090 --> 03:00:04,490
Karma's a bitch, my friend.

4191
03:00:05,550 --> 03:00:06,750
Why did that door open?

4192
03:00:07,230 --> 03:00:07,710
Hello?

4193
03:00:10,630 --> 03:00:11,890
The man at the door seemed...

4194
03:00:11,890 --> 03:00:13,510
irrelevant compared to how tired I was.

4195
03:00:13,650 --> 03:00:14,070
Stop!

4196
03:00:14,290 --> 03:00:15,310
Are you kidding me?

4197
03:00:15,730 --> 03:00:16,210
Sydney.

4198
03:00:16,770 --> 03:00:18,210
I couldn't keep my eyes open.

4199
03:00:18,210 --> 03:00:19,910
I had to get some sleep.

4200
03:00:32,780 --> 03:00:33,820
I had to get some sleep.

4201
03:00:33,820 --> 03:00:34,720
Yeah, the light's on here.

4202
03:00:36,040 --> 03:00:37,020
This is...

4203
03:00:38,280 --> 03:00:39,820
Zero survival instinct.

4204
03:00:40,380 --> 03:00:41,080
At all.

4205
03:00:42,520 --> 03:00:43,940
Zero survival instincts.

4206
03:00:46,380 --> 03:00:48,260
Couldn't go to bed with the bedroom door wide open.

4207
03:00:48,400 --> 03:00:50,160
Couldn't go to bed with the bedroom door wide open.

4208
03:00:50,260 --> 03:00:51,520
Oh my god.

4209
03:00:54,360 --> 03:00:55,220
What's going on?

4210
03:01:02,780 --> 03:01:03,100
What's

4211
03:01:14,640 --> 03:01:14,960
going on?

4212
03:01:14,960 --> 03:01:15,920
I might have to turn...

4213
03:01:15,920 --> 03:01:17,040
I might have to turn...

4214
03:01:18,480 --> 03:01:19,500
off the sound.

4215
03:01:19,640 --> 03:01:21,080
So if I have to do that, I'm really sorry.

4216
03:01:38,100 --> 03:01:40,180
Rick, I'm sorry to bother you again, but can you come back over?

4217
03:01:40,720 --> 03:01:41,360
There's someone...

4218
03:01:41,360 --> 03:01:43,580
They're Subwood.

4219
03:01:43,680 --> 03:01:45,320
We met driving down here.

4220
03:01:45,460 --> 03:01:47,020
He was banging on the door and started threatening me.

4221
03:01:47,020 --> 03:01:47,500
I'm pretty scared.

4222
03:01:47,540 --> 03:01:49,620
I think I hear him moving around outside the house.

4223
03:01:49,760 --> 03:01:51,740
Could you please come look since you live so close?

4224
03:01:54,200 --> 03:01:55,400
Watch, he's gonna be like...

4225
03:01:55,400 --> 03:01:56,700
Sydney, I'm...

4226
03:01:56,700 --> 03:01:58,120
I'm out of the state.

4227
03:01:58,300 --> 03:01:59,900
I can't come at all.

4228
03:02:01,440 --> 03:02:02,380
SOS, that's me!

4229
03:02:03,080 --> 03:02:03,600
That's me!

4230
03:02:15,030 --> 03:02:15,430
Hello?

4231
03:02:17,230 --> 03:02:18,010
What do I do?

4232
03:02:19,810 --> 03:02:20,990
Me too, too, too, too.

4233
03:02:26,020 --> 03:02:26,420
Hello?

4234
03:02:26,780 --> 03:02:27,180
Hello?

4235
03:02:40,420 --> 03:02:41,860
Wait, it wasn't this...

4236
03:02:41,860 --> 03:02:43,400
Oh, he was throwing stuff at it.

4237
03:02:43,460 --> 03:02:44,640
It wasn't this dirty before, right?

4238
03:02:46,120 --> 03:02:46,600
Okay.

4239
03:02:47,700 --> 03:02:48,440
I'm scared.

4240
03:02:49,320 --> 03:02:50,200
There's a snowball.

4241
03:03:04,680 --> 03:03:05,760
Open the door, miss.

4242
03:03:05,820 --> 03:03:06,220
It's me.

4243
03:03:07,260 --> 03:03:07,800
It's who?

4244
03:03:09,140 --> 03:03:09,620
Oh!

4245
03:03:10,300 --> 03:03:11,400
He's got his hammer!

4246
03:03:13,560 --> 03:03:14,820
Are they in cahoots?

4247
03:03:15,500 --> 03:03:16,820
Wait, Rick is so fast.

4248
03:03:18,200 --> 03:03:18,680
Um...

4249
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:20,820
Open door...

4250
03:03:20,820 --> 03:03:22,280
Oh gosh, this is giving me a tummy ache.

4251
03:03:23,420 --> 03:03:25,060
This is giving me a tummy ache.

4252
03:03:26,420 --> 03:03:27,080
Oh, hello!

4253
03:03:27,620 --> 03:03:28,940
What the hell is going on here?

4254
03:03:30,380 --> 03:03:31,500
Did you see anyone outside?

4255
03:03:32,120 --> 03:03:33,420
I might have seen something.

4256
03:03:33,940 --> 03:03:34,940
Could have been anyone.

4257
03:03:35,060 --> 03:03:36,300
Or no one at all.

4258
03:03:36,340 --> 03:03:36,920
What does that mean?

4259
03:03:38,420 --> 03:03:39,140
Explain the situation.

4260
03:03:40,360 --> 03:03:42,080
Yeah, I came as quickly as I could.

4261
03:03:43,120 --> 03:03:44,840
I wouldn't worry about him anymore.

4262
03:03:45,260 --> 03:03:46,300
Wait, is that the...

4263
03:03:46,300 --> 03:03:47,780
The screaming we heard?

4264
03:03:53,680 --> 03:03:54,060
Okay.

4265
03:03:56,240 --> 03:03:56,620
Okay.

4266
03:03:56,620 --> 03:03:57,200
Oh my god.

4267
03:03:59,840 --> 03:04:01,840
By the way, where's your friend?

4268
03:04:01,940 --> 03:04:03,240
The guy who was with you earlier?

4269
03:04:04,900 --> 03:04:05,280
He...

4270
03:04:05,720 --> 03:04:06,760
He should be back soon.

4271
03:04:08,100 --> 03:04:08,480
Rickrolled?

4272
03:04:10,420 --> 03:04:12,480
So you're all alone here right now, huh?

4273
03:04:13,960 --> 03:04:16,560
Yeah, but my friends will be back soon.

4274
03:04:17,380 --> 03:04:18,440
Wait, why did we say yeah?

4275
03:04:18,560 --> 03:04:19,260
Are we stupid?

4276
03:04:19,420 --> 03:04:20,260
I think we're really stupid.

4277
03:04:20,540 --> 03:04:21,180
I think we're dumb.

4278
03:04:21,800 --> 03:04:22,180
I think we're an idiot.

4279
03:04:22,360 --> 03:04:22,960
Where are you going?

4280
03:04:23,140 --> 03:04:23,860
You should be leaving!

4281
03:04:29,280 --> 03:04:30,600
You're just gonna make yourself comfortable?

4282
03:04:39,800 --> 03:04:41,680
I think I'm gonna wait outside for my friends.

4283
03:04:41,900 --> 03:04:44,260
I still didn't feel safe opening the door.

4284
03:04:44,460 --> 03:04:47,800
Why do you feel safer with this guy in your room?

4285
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:49,740
No way.

4286
03:04:51,660 --> 03:04:52,960
Thank you for the gift.

4287
03:04:52,960 --> 03:04:53,560
Thank you so much.

4288
03:04:55,980 --> 03:04:56,860
This girl...

4289
03:04:56,860 --> 03:04:58,040
I can't stand Sydney.

4290
03:04:58,240 --> 03:04:58,940
She's the enemy.

4291
03:05:01,280 --> 03:05:01,760
Oh.

4292
03:05:02,320 --> 03:05:05,020
There was another thing that popped up but it went away fast.

4293
03:05:05,380 --> 03:05:07,600
Storms like this bring out all kinds of folks.

4294
03:05:09,260 --> 03:05:11,400
Not all of them know when to stay away.

4295
03:05:13,300 --> 03:05:13,780
Huh?

4296
03:05:14,260 --> 03:05:15,080
What does that mean?

4297
03:05:18,340 --> 03:05:19,240
Oh no!

4298
03:05:20,100 --> 03:05:21,340
Here he comes!

4299
03:05:21,480 --> 03:05:21,880
Here he comes!

4300
03:05:24,960 --> 03:05:26,360
Here he comes!

4301
03:05:26,560 --> 03:05:31,100
Come back over?

4302
03:05:31,300 --> 03:05:31,960
What do you mean?

4303
03:05:32,140 --> 03:05:33,200
I live in Burlington.

4304
03:05:33,440 --> 03:05:35,720
I haven't been to the rental in weeks!

4305
03:05:38,540 --> 03:05:40,040
Oh my gosh, Rick.

4306
03:05:41,780 --> 03:05:42,240
The

4307
03:06:05,590 --> 03:06:06,450
game is...

4308
03:06:07,630 --> 03:06:08,090
No!

4309
03:06:08,250 --> 03:06:09,610
There's an invisible...

4310
03:06:13,330 --> 03:06:13,790
My

4311
03:06:20,440 --> 03:06:20,640
god!

4312
03:06:20,740 --> 03:06:22,420
The game is trying to kill us!

4313
03:06:22,460 --> 03:06:23,600
The game is trying to kill us!

4314
03:06:25,800 --> 03:06:26,260
No!

4315
03:06:37,760 --> 03:06:39,000
Everything okay, miss?

4316
03:06:39,660 --> 03:06:40,120
Yeah.

4317
03:06:40,780 --> 03:06:42,300
Awful late for texting, isn't it?

4318
03:06:42,460 --> 03:06:43,540
Who you talking to?

4319
03:06:45,120 --> 03:06:46,740
You are not Rick, are you?

4320
03:06:47,160 --> 03:06:48,000
That's my friends.

4321
03:06:48,040 --> 03:06:48,600
They're almost here.

4322
03:06:49,600 --> 03:06:50,400
Is that so?

4323
03:06:51,080 --> 03:06:51,540
Yeah.

4324
03:06:51,600 --> 03:06:52,700
Thanks for coming by, though.

4325
03:06:54,300 --> 03:06:55,340
I'll be fine now.

4326
03:06:56,420 --> 03:06:58,260
You can head back if...

4327
03:06:58,260 --> 03:06:59,460
No, don't say if you want!

4328
03:07:00,660 --> 03:07:01,100
I should head back now?

4329
03:07:01,380 --> 03:07:03,300
You could leave the home!

4330
03:07:04,400 --> 03:07:05,460
Are you sure about that?

4331
03:07:05,800 --> 03:07:06,260
Yeah.

4332
03:07:06,300 --> 03:07:07,440
I just overreacted.

4333
03:07:07,820 --> 03:07:09,120
Maybe I should stick around.

4334
03:07:09,280 --> 03:07:10,940
Make sure everything's really okay.

4335
03:07:17,290 --> 03:07:20,230
None of these options are gonna lead to a good answer.

4336
03:07:21,730 --> 03:07:24,870
None of these options are gonna lead to a good answer!

4337
03:07:25,470 --> 03:07:26,650
Oh my god!

4338
03:07:30,740 --> 03:07:31,180
Oh my god!

4339
03:07:31,180 --> 03:07:31,440
Oh my god!

4340
03:07:31,460 --> 03:07:32,080
And I'm stuck!

4341
03:07:32,400 --> 03:07:34,440
If I need to run, I'm trapped, for real.

4342
03:07:37,080 --> 03:07:38,360
I'm just gonna say, you need to leave.

4343
03:07:39,500 --> 03:07:40,620
What did you just say?

4344
03:07:43,020 --> 03:07:43,420
Confront.

4345
03:07:44,660 --> 03:07:46,220
This is my fucking house.

4346
03:07:46,340 --> 03:07:47,980
I will leave when I want to.

4347
03:07:49,540 --> 03:07:50,320
What do you want?

4348
03:07:50,820 --> 03:07:52,000
I want what's mine.

4349
03:07:52,220 --> 03:07:53,000
This house.

4350
03:07:53,220 --> 03:07:54,140
And you!

4351
03:07:56,060 --> 03:07:56,860
You're trespassing.

4352
03:07:57,760 --> 03:07:59,100
Get out of here before I call the...

4353
03:07:59,100 --> 03:08:00,640
He's gonna say there's no cops here.

4354
03:08:00,780 --> 03:08:01,820
You need to leave right now.

4355
03:08:01,820 --> 03:08:03,660
I don't think so.

4356
03:08:03,880 --> 03:08:08,140
If anyone's leaving this house, it will be one of us.

4357
03:08:08,160 --> 03:08:08,540
You know what?

4358
03:08:09,920 --> 03:08:10,600
I'll go.

4359
03:08:11,100 --> 03:08:12,220
Actually, great idea.

4360
03:08:12,680 --> 03:08:13,880
Let me leave.

4361
03:08:14,200 --> 03:08:15,720
I'll just walk out the front door.

4362
03:08:16,160 --> 03:08:17,120
I won't come back.

4363
03:08:17,220 --> 03:08:17,960
Let me go.

4364
03:08:18,120 --> 03:08:18,540
You know?

4365
03:08:20,360 --> 03:08:22,400
If one of us needs to leave, I'll go.

4366
03:08:28,400 --> 03:08:29,300
What is he doing?

4367
03:08:35,880 --> 03:08:36,300
Ah!

4368
03:08:45,950 --> 03:08:47,490
Why are you so slow?

4369
03:08:47,650 --> 03:08:48,090
I don't know.

4370
03:08:48,270 --> 03:08:48,690
What?

4371
03:08:50,770 --> 03:08:51,570
Oh, whoa.

4372
03:08:52,070 --> 03:08:53,030
Whoa, hold on.

4373
03:08:53,390 --> 03:08:55,090
Hold on.

4374
03:08:55,090 --> 03:08:56,080
The game just like...

4375
03:08:57,890 --> 03:08:58,450
Hold on.

4376
03:08:58,590 --> 03:08:59,170
Oh my gosh.

4377
03:08:59,350 --> 03:09:00,010
Oh my gosh.

4378
03:09:01,690 --> 03:09:02,350
There we go.

4379
03:09:02,730 --> 03:09:03,150
Okay.

4380
03:09:03,230 --> 03:09:03,970
And it like turned.

4381
03:09:04,070 --> 03:09:04,890
I had it like here.

4382
03:09:06,670 --> 03:09:07,310
There we go.

4383
03:09:08,950 --> 03:09:09,850
What just happened?

4384
03:09:11,350 --> 03:09:12,030
What just happened?

4385
03:09:12,050 --> 03:09:12,470
What just happened?

4386
03:09:13,850 --> 03:09:15,050
I hope it auto-saved.

4387
03:09:17,210 --> 03:09:18,170
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

4388
03:09:18,410 --> 03:09:19,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4389
03:09:19,130 --> 03:09:19,430
We're good.

4390
03:09:19,490 --> 03:09:19,690
We're good.

4391
03:09:19,770 --> 03:09:19,990
We're good.

4392
03:09:21,450 --> 03:09:22,170
Okay, so...

4393
03:09:22,170 --> 03:09:22,390
What?

4394
03:09:25,210 --> 03:09:27,510
So while he's hanging out there...

4395
03:09:28,370 --> 03:09:28,730
Um...

4396
03:09:31,510 --> 03:09:32,570
So don't leave.

4397
03:09:33,490 --> 03:09:34,990
Maybe I... I don't want to go upstairs.

4398
03:09:35,090 --> 03:09:38,830
I think he'll notice me walking... Do I go into the basement and hide in the little closet?

4399
03:09:39,290 --> 03:09:43,490
Or maybe I go into the attic because he won't be able to get in there, right?

4400
03:09:45,190 --> 03:09:45,870
I think...

4401
03:09:45,870 --> 03:09:48,550
I think hiding in the attic because even if...

4402
03:09:49,810 --> 03:09:51,130
If, uh... What's his name?

4403
03:09:51,250 --> 03:09:51,750
Or... Wait.

4404
03:09:51,910 --> 03:09:52,290
Oh.

4405
03:10:03,850 --> 03:10:05,010
Maybe it doesn't matter.

4406
03:10:10,850 --> 03:10:12,550
Oh, are we sure he doesn't live in the walls?

4407
03:10:12,650 --> 03:10:13,390
I guess that's true.

4408
03:10:13,530 --> 03:10:17,950
I guess we go hide in that little storage wall then, right?

4409
03:10:18,430 --> 03:10:18,830
Okay.

4410
03:10:20,270 --> 03:10:21,010
Basement is closer.

4411
03:10:21,190 --> 03:10:22,410
True, true, true, true, true.

4412
03:10:24,190 --> 03:10:25,490
He kind of was like, What are you doing?

4413
03:10:26,870 --> 03:10:27,550
Oh gosh, okay.

4414
03:10:27,710 --> 03:10:28,790
We got to do all this again.

4415
03:10:30,010 --> 03:10:30,910
La, la, la, la, la!

4416
03:10:30,910 --> 03:10:32,090
Let's just like, uh...

4417
03:10:32,970 --> 03:10:33,610
Let's just...

4418
03:10:35,130 --> 03:10:36,010
Make it go fast.

4419
03:10:36,290 --> 03:10:37,370
It came as quickly as it could.

4420
03:10:37,770 --> 03:10:38,610
Wouldn't worry about him.

4421
03:10:41,410 --> 03:10:42,050
Uh... Rick.

4422
03:10:42,150 --> 03:10:42,770
Nothing personal.

4423
03:10:42,830 --> 03:10:44,030
We got Rickrolled for real.

4424
03:10:46,890 --> 03:10:48,370
Mike went to go pick up another friend.

4425
03:10:48,750 --> 03:10:49,070
Hmm...

4426
03:10:55,210 --> 03:10:56,390
Why is he doing...

4427
03:10:56,390 --> 03:10:57,450
Why does he act like this?

4428
03:10:59,690 --> 03:11:00,890
Here, I'm gonna preempt...

4429
03:11:00,890 --> 03:11:01,370
I'm gonna...

4430
03:11:02,530 --> 03:11:03,290
Get ready.

4431
03:11:03,410 --> 03:11:03,870
You know?

4432
03:11:05,250 --> 03:11:06,590
We'll have it get ready, right?

4433
03:11:07,790 --> 03:11:08,230
Oh!

4434
03:11:08,290 --> 03:11:09,690
It says something there.

4435
03:11:09,730 --> 03:11:10,670
But it goes by too fast.

4436
03:11:11,410 --> 03:11:13,470
Storms like this bring out all kinds of folks.

4437
03:11:13,930 --> 03:11:14,770
And then...

4438
03:11:18,230 --> 03:11:19,110
Come back.

4439
03:11:19,110 --> 03:11:19,430
Come back over.

4440
03:11:19,590 --> 03:11:20,350
Oh my god!

4441
03:11:31,280 --> 03:11:32,080
Everything okay?

4442
03:11:32,400 --> 03:11:33,300
Yeah, oh wait.

4443
03:11:33,720 --> 03:11:34,800
You're not Rick, are you?

4444
03:11:34,880 --> 03:11:35,760
What did you just say?

4445
03:11:37,620 --> 03:11:38,020
Um...

4446
03:11:39,040 --> 03:11:39,920
You need to leave.

4447
03:11:40,160 --> 03:11:40,920
I don't think so.

4448
03:11:41,020 --> 03:11:42,380
If anyone's leaving this house...

4449
03:11:42,380 --> 03:11:43,620
It will be one of us.

4450
03:11:43,660 --> 03:11:43,800
Okay.

4451
03:11:44,340 --> 03:11:46,200
I will probably have to mute...

4452
03:11:48,240 --> 03:11:49,560
Uh, the audio in the game.

4453
03:11:49,720 --> 03:11:51,400
So I'm sorry that it will be muted.

4454
03:11:51,520 --> 03:11:52,380
And me as well.

4455
03:11:52,480 --> 03:11:54,000
Because otherwise it just picks up...

4456
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:55,340
My mic is too sensitive, I guess.

4457
03:13:51,310 --> 03:13:52,110
I think...

4458
03:13:52,110 --> 03:13:53,290
I think for that part...

4459
03:13:53,290 --> 03:13:55,850
I have to run into the closet.

4460
03:13:56,630 --> 03:13:57,190
The attic.

4461
03:13:57,330 --> 03:13:57,790
Oh my gosh!

4462
03:13:57,810 --> 03:13:58,310
It did it again!

4463
03:14:04,980 --> 03:14:06,840
I think I have to go to the closet.

4464
03:14:07,200 --> 03:14:08,000
For that part.

4465
03:14:08,600 --> 03:14:09,880
Sorry for your ears.

4466
03:14:12,120 --> 03:14:13,060
I was like...

4467
03:14:13,760 --> 03:14:15,340
Basically the phone went off...

4468
03:14:15,340 --> 03:14:16,920
And then he got me and I had to run.

4469
03:14:17,180 --> 03:14:17,580
So...

4470
03:14:19,640 --> 03:14:20,520
Hide under the bed?

4471
03:14:20,760 --> 03:14:21,960
I don't know if it would have let me.

4472
03:14:24,300 --> 03:14:25,720
I think I have to go to the closet.

4473
03:14:25,880 --> 03:14:26,680
And then be quiet there.

4474
03:14:28,380 --> 03:14:28,740
So...

4475
03:14:28,740 --> 03:14:29,760
I was just...

4476
03:14:30,280 --> 03:14:31,840
Sorry if I have to keep the audio off.

4477
03:14:31,940 --> 03:14:33,840
Gosh, I don't want to keep losing because...

4478
03:14:33,840 --> 03:14:33,980
Oh!

4479
03:14:34,140 --> 03:14:34,960
Hiding in the basement.

4480
03:14:35,160 --> 03:14:35,400
Perfect.

4481
03:14:36,980 --> 03:14:37,940
Audio, be gone!

4482
03:16:36,910 --> 03:16:37,270
No!

4483
03:16:39,070 --> 03:16:40,110
Okay, I have to go...

4484
03:16:40,110 --> 03:16:40,630
Oh my gosh!

4485
03:16:41,710 --> 03:16:42,790
Oh my gosh!

4486
03:16:42,910 --> 03:16:43,950
They called me!

4487
03:16:46,690 --> 03:16:48,170
And then he heard me!

4488
03:16:48,630 --> 03:16:48,730
And then he heard me!

4489
03:16:50,390 --> 03:16:50,870
Okay.

4490
03:16:52,090 --> 03:16:52,850
It's like a...

4491
03:16:52,850 --> 03:16:54,970
It's like a different thing every time.

4492
03:16:55,050 --> 03:16:55,990
Nora, you bitch!

4493
03:16:58,150 --> 03:16:59,390
Yeah, he heard the phone.

4494
03:17:01,530 --> 03:17:03,070
So yeah, he gonna...

4495
03:17:03,650 --> 03:17:04,630
Okay, so...

4496
03:17:04,630 --> 03:17:06,610
Now can we go from the attic?

4497
03:17:07,710 --> 03:17:09,770
No, we have to do hiding in the basement again!

4498
03:17:10,330 --> 03:17:10,690
No, we have to do hiding in the basement again!

4499
03:17:10,690 --> 03:17:12,490
Okay, so I have to go into the attic.

4500
03:17:13,450 --> 03:17:15,310
As soon as... and...

4501
03:17:15,650 --> 03:17:17,470
They call me and I go hide in the attic maybe.

4502
03:17:17,630 --> 03:17:18,010
I don't know.

4503
03:17:23,650 --> 03:17:24,050
No!

4504
03:17:24,050 --> 03:17:24,830
My gosh!

4505
03:17:27,550 --> 03:17:28,570
You are muted too.

4506
03:17:28,630 --> 03:17:29,410
Yeah, I have to be!

4507
03:17:30,650 --> 03:17:31,050
Because...

4508
03:17:32,470 --> 03:17:33,950
My mic is too sensitive.

4509
03:17:34,110 --> 03:17:35,090
It doesn't have a noise gate.

4510
03:17:35,170 --> 03:17:36,270
My interface.

4511
03:17:36,350 --> 03:17:37,190
So it like...

4512
03:17:37,190 --> 03:17:37,930
Picks up everything.

4513
03:17:42,760 --> 03:17:43,160
Okay.

4514
03:20:11,020 --> 03:20:11,780
Go downstairs.

4515
03:20:26,080 --> 03:20:27,460
He said open the door.

4516
03:20:31,800 --> 03:20:32,240
Oh!

4517
03:20:33,100 --> 03:20:34,020
He's called 911.

4518
03:20:35,720 --> 03:20:37,580
Just got done talking to other guests on the phone.

4519
03:20:37,620 --> 03:20:38,100
I called 911.

4520
03:20:39,120 --> 03:20:39,560
Oh!

4521
03:20:44,220 --> 03:20:45,160
Do I just go?

4522
03:20:49,600 --> 03:20:51,240
I guess it's okay?

4523
03:20:51,820 --> 03:20:53,000
Can I take you with me?

4524
03:20:53,540 --> 03:20:53,980
Hehehe

4525
03:20:59,330 --> 03:20:59,970
It's safe?

4526
03:21:00,170 --> 03:21:00,910
Is it actually?

4527
03:21:20,320 --> 03:21:21,160
Okay, I'm gonna go.

4528
03:21:24,520 --> 03:21:24,920
Oh!

4529
03:21:25,520 --> 03:21:26,420
I can't sprint.

4530
03:21:28,160 --> 03:21:29,300
I have to be very slow.

4531
03:21:31,860 --> 03:21:32,720
Who's playing music?

4532
03:21:34,980 --> 03:21:35,640
What's that noise?

4533
03:21:36,060 --> 03:21:36,460
Hello!

4534
03:21:36,680 --> 03:21:37,560
I have my hands up!

4535
03:21:40,440 --> 03:21:41,760
Oh, I think he left out the background.

4536
03:21:41,760 --> 03:21:42,580
Jesus!

4537
03:21:43,960 --> 03:21:45,160
Oh my god!

4538
03:21:52,340 --> 03:21:56,170
Everything that happened after Mike had left.

4539
03:21:56,610 --> 03:21:57,950
Rick had called the cops.

4540
03:21:58,230 --> 03:22:00,370
The storm had quieted down by the time they arrived.

4541
03:22:00,490 --> 03:22:00,950
How convenient.

4542
03:22:01,590 --> 03:22:03,870
And of course, the man was nowhere to be seen.

4543
03:22:08,990 --> 03:22:12,630
On our drive back, the whole night played over and over in my head.

4544
03:22:13,630 --> 03:22:17,570
We think that the man we saw secretly lived in that cabin when it wasn't being used.

4545
03:22:17,810 --> 03:22:19,870
And planned on robbing us during our stay.

4546
03:22:20,830 --> 03:22:25,410
But cops seemed to think that there was more intent behind this man's actions aside from just robbing us.

4547
03:22:25,450 --> 03:22:26,490
What happened to the other guy?

4548
03:22:26,710 --> 03:22:28,390
Why is everybody so sussy in this town?

4549
03:22:30,970 --> 03:22:35,230
Rick asked me what the man looked like and after that, he didn't ask any more questions.

4550
03:22:35,590 --> 03:22:37,830
We think he knew more than he was letting on.

4551
03:22:38,770 --> 03:22:41,330
But in the end, he gave us a full refund.

4552
03:22:41,410 --> 03:22:42,590
I would hope so.

4553
03:22:45,850 --> 03:22:46,450
Lesson learned.

4554
03:22:46,530 --> 03:22:48,010
Don't ever leave the office.

4555
03:22:50,330 --> 03:22:51,210
Oh, survivor!

4556
03:22:53,270 --> 03:22:53,710
Wait.

4557
03:22:54,850 --> 03:22:56,110
What is that implying?

4558
03:22:59,510 --> 03:23:01,110
Why is he looking in the basement?

4559
03:23:01,250 --> 03:23:02,210
What's that implying, huh?

4560
03:23:04,390 --> 03:23:05,290
Oh, Lily Peach!

4561
03:23:06,050 --> 03:23:07,310
Yeah, you guys were right.

4562
03:23:07,590 --> 03:23:09,290
In that case, so die.

4563
03:23:12,230 --> 03:23:14,050
HAHAHAHA Just done with that.

4564
03:23:14,530 --> 03:23:14,830
Well...

4565
03:23:14,830 --> 03:23:15,210
It's the police!

4566
03:23:15,330 --> 03:23:15,830
OK, never mind.

4567
03:23:17,150 --> 03:23:18,950
Are they gonna find that other guy's body?

4568
03:23:21,190 --> 03:23:22,750
And this is so happy sounding.

4569
03:23:23,050 --> 03:23:26,210
La la la la la la la la la la la...

4570
03:23:27,430 --> 03:23:32,850
The', da da da da da da da da da, da da, da da da, da da da, da da, da da da, da da da da...

4571
03:23:44,750 --> 03:23:45,990
We made it!

4572
03:23:46,010 --> 03:23:46,830
Yeah, what happened to the hiker?

4573
03:23:47,010 --> 03:23:48,790
Thanks for playing Fears to Fathom.

4574
03:23:49,090 --> 03:23:50,970
This is why hotels over Airbnb.

4575
03:23:54,770 --> 03:23:58,910
I wonder... I don't remember the other ones having a credit like that.

4576
03:23:59,150 --> 03:24:00,910
I wonder if... Oh, hold on.

4577
03:24:06,670 --> 03:24:08,550
I see... I have to do this.

4578
03:24:08,630 --> 03:24:09,810
I have to do this every time.

4579
03:24:10,590 --> 03:24:12,690
Or else I'm like all messed up.

4580
03:24:15,210 --> 03:24:15,650
Yeah!

4581
03:24:16,550 --> 03:24:19,450
Bent up staying in an Airbnb next month for the first time.

4582
03:24:19,490 --> 03:24:20,370
What should I do?

4583
03:24:25,010 --> 03:24:26,330
Don't let any Ricks inside.

4584
03:24:27,930 --> 03:24:29,330
Even if your own name is Rick.

4585
03:24:29,810 --> 03:24:30,570
Don't do it.

4586
03:24:31,930 --> 03:24:33,090
Refund, refund, refund.

4587
03:24:40,660 --> 03:24:41,660
Don't get Rickrolled.

4588
03:24:42,100 --> 03:24:43,920
Don't play hide and seek in Jenga.

4589
03:24:44,400 --> 03:24:46,420
The hide and seek was so wild.

4590
03:24:48,760 --> 03:24:51,640
This guy is just like, hey, I'm interested in you.

4591
03:24:51,900 --> 03:24:52,960
Do you want to play hide and seek?

4592
03:24:53,160 --> 03:24:58,380
I wonder whatever happened with the sender and Mikey, huh?

4593
03:25:01,060 --> 03:25:03,280
He overstepped his boundaries a little bit.

4594
03:25:05,000 --> 03:25:08,460
I thought it was going to be a switcheroo and he was going to be the bad guy, you know?

4595
03:25:08,800 --> 03:25:11,800
But in the end, it was fine, I guess.

4596
03:25:12,280 --> 03:25:15,240
Just remember, if you think you have zero Riz, you could be worse.

4597
03:25:15,400 --> 03:25:16,100
You could be Mike.

4598
03:25:20,120 --> 03:25:20,520
Yeah.

4599
03:25:21,880 --> 03:25:23,540
But did anyone ever feed the cat?

4600
03:25:23,940 --> 03:25:29,080
I feel like if this guy was living in the attic and he has a cat, he can't be so bad, right?

4601
03:25:31,160 --> 03:25:33,040
You can't have a cat and be bad.

4602
03:25:34,120 --> 03:25:34,880
I don't think.

4603
03:25:34,880 --> 03:25:34,960
I don't think.

4604
03:25:46,840 --> 03:25:48,400
He killed you with a hammer.

4605
03:25:55,630 --> 03:25:56,810
I guess that's true.

4606
03:25:59,370 --> 03:26:01,750
He killed you multiple times.

4607
03:26:08,410 --> 03:26:10,090
I guess that's true.

4608
03:26:11,470 --> 03:26:13,090
I guess that's true.

4609
03:26:14,530 --> 03:26:18,990
Well, what if he was trying to use my body to feed the cat?

4610
03:26:23,840 --> 03:26:24,680
To feed the cat.

4611
03:26:25,500 --> 03:26:26,920
I've got a bell, but thank you for the stream.

4612
03:26:27,060 --> 03:26:27,400
Thank you.

4613
03:26:28,440 --> 03:26:30,060
I'm terrified of being Mike.

4614
03:26:30,340 --> 03:26:34,520
I'm fairly certain cats are most evil geniuses.

4615
03:26:36,180 --> 03:26:36,580
No.

4616
03:26:37,660 --> 03:26:39,720
For Rick, it was indeed hammer time.

4617
03:26:42,140 --> 03:26:43,680
He could just buy cat food.

4618
03:26:45,240 --> 03:26:46,920
Cats eat a little human as a treat?

4619
03:26:47,180 --> 03:26:47,360
Yeah.

4620
03:26:47,860 --> 03:26:48,780
Some eat mice.

4621
03:26:49,320 --> 03:26:50,220
Some eat humans.

4622
03:26:51,880 --> 03:26:52,520
I don't know.

4623
03:26:55,200 --> 03:26:55,880
I don't know.

4624
03:26:57,320 --> 03:26:58,400
I'm just sayin'.

4625
03:26:59,740 --> 03:27:02,420
But also, maybe, I guess he lived in the basement instead.

4626
03:27:03,520 --> 03:27:07,520
So who was feeding the cat if he lived in the basement?

4627
03:27:08,580 --> 03:27:12,140
Because he probably was in that room that was like, dude, no guests enter.

4628
03:27:13,040 --> 03:27:16,780
If you check the room in the basement, you see he was living down there and how he got into the house.

4629
03:27:17,140 --> 03:27:18,400
Wait, how do you check it?

4630
03:27:19,040 --> 03:27:20,540
Wait, how do you actually see it?

4631
03:27:29,620 --> 03:27:31,440
Thank you for the five gifts and thank you!

4632
03:27:33,220 --> 03:27:33,700
Walk?

4633
03:27:34,040 --> 03:27:35,860
Okay, smart aleck.

4634
03:27:39,500 --> 03:27:40,820
Probably when he's out and about.

4635
03:27:41,100 --> 03:27:42,740
I think you check at the reveal part.

4636
03:27:43,640 --> 03:27:47,720
Oh, like instead of hiding in the... in the um...

4637
03:27:48,640 --> 03:27:49,320
What's it called?

4638
03:27:49,620 --> 03:27:51,400
But it said we couldn't get the door open.

4639
03:27:52,580 --> 03:27:56,080
I think we can only get the door open when he opens it, right?

4640
03:27:56,980 --> 03:27:57,960
I don't know.

4641
03:28:00,220 --> 03:28:01,180
But this is fine.

4642
03:28:01,300 --> 03:28:02,280
I hope you guys liked it.

4643
03:28:02,400 --> 03:28:06,360
I hope you guys were feared to freakdom.

4644
03:28:06,920 --> 03:28:08,800
And yeah, this is a good time.

4645
03:28:11,860 --> 03:28:16,120
If they don't continue the series, I hope they do maybe other things similar.

4646
03:28:16,460 --> 03:28:21,260
But if they do continue this series, then you can count on me.

4647
03:28:21,400 --> 03:28:22,380
I'm playing them, baby!

4648
03:28:24,140 --> 03:28:25,240
So it was fun.

4649
03:28:25,660 --> 03:28:26,320
Yeah.

4650
03:28:28,260 --> 03:28:29,500
Fear to freak.

4651
03:28:30,020 --> 03:28:30,680
Yeah.

4652
03:28:31,020 --> 03:28:32,360
IT was fun.

4653
03:28:33,420 --> 03:28:34,560
Great stream event.

4654
03:28:34,740 --> 03:28:35,740
And another note.

4655
03:28:35,840 --> 03:28:39,060
I was wondering, have you finished Bunny Garden offline?

4656
03:28:39,920 --> 03:28:41,240
Uh, no.

4657
03:28:43,900 --> 03:28:45,060
I haven't.

4658
03:28:46,120 --> 03:28:46,780
Two!

4659
03:28:49,150 --> 03:28:49,810
Two!

4660
03:28:51,250 --> 03:28:52,170
Should I?

4661
03:28:53,990 --> 03:28:55,490
He's a killer, but has a cat.

4662
03:28:55,630 --> 03:28:55,810
Mint.

4663
03:28:55,930 --> 03:28:57,190
Okay, he's a yellow flag.

4664
03:29:11,560 --> 03:29:13,300
Sorry, can't stop me laughing now.

4665
03:29:14,400 --> 03:29:16,480
The blonde girl from Bunny Garden is getting an android.

4666
03:29:16,580 --> 03:29:17,740
I did see that, actually.

4667
03:29:17,940 --> 03:29:23,240
It's kind of crazy how, like, crazy, like, popular Bunny Garden popped off.

4668
03:29:25,520 --> 03:29:26,300
Pretty funny.

4669
03:29:27,540 --> 03:29:27,980
But...

4670
03:29:29,340 --> 03:29:30,800
Lethal Company-ass music.

4671
03:29:31,000 --> 03:29:32,780
I wanna be playing Lethal Company!

4672
03:29:33,400 --> 03:29:34,600
I love Lethal Company.

4673
03:29:34,720 --> 03:29:35,060
So fun.

4674
03:29:37,740 --> 03:29:40,300
Apparently there's, like, a new monster in it.

4675
03:29:40,340 --> 03:29:42,440
Maybe I should organize something for Lethal Company.

4676
03:29:43,120 --> 03:29:45,020
Maybe I should find some people to play with.

4677
03:29:47,540 --> 03:29:48,420
But yeah.

4678
03:29:49,140 --> 03:29:50,780
Um, I'm gonna go...

4679
03:29:50,780 --> 03:29:55,360
Uh, my dinner... I only had, like, a little bit, so I'm gonna go get another scoop.

4680
03:29:56,420 --> 03:29:57,620
Of mac and cheese.

4681
03:29:57,620 --> 03:30:00,400
And I'm gonna go to bed.

4682
03:30:00,740 --> 03:30:01,800
I've been going to bed...

4683
03:30:01,800 --> 03:30:06,760
Last night I went to bed at 9 PM and I woke up this morning at, like, 8 AM.

4684
03:30:07,220 --> 03:30:09,380
I got so much sleep.

4685
03:30:10,200 --> 03:30:11,240
Thanks for the fun stream!

4686
03:30:11,360 --> 03:30:11,760
Thank you!

4687
03:30:13,060 --> 03:30:13,580
Oh!

4688
03:30:13,580 --> 03:30:14,840
While I was hiding!

4689
03:30:15,600 --> 03:30:16,080
Um...

4690
03:30:16,420 --> 03:30:19,160
Joy, thank you for the Hakasupa!

4691
03:30:19,980 --> 03:30:21,040
And, uh...

4692
03:30:21,040 --> 03:30:22,220
Who was the other one?

4693
03:30:22,440 --> 03:30:22,860
Uh...

4694
03:30:22,860 --> 03:30:24,180
Daniel, thank you!

4695
03:30:24,680 --> 03:30:25,060
You're welcome!

4696
03:30:25,500 --> 03:30:25,700
You're welcome!

4697
03:30:27,120 --> 03:30:27,680
Thank you!

4698
03:30:27,760 --> 03:30:28,100
Thank you so much!

4699
03:30:28,280 --> 03:30:31,300
While I was being sneaky and unable to react.

4700
03:30:31,620 --> 03:30:33,100
I don't know if you could tell me...

4701
03:30:33,100 --> 03:30:34,940
Or if you could tell that my voice...

4702
03:30:34,940 --> 03:30:36,540
Or my... I was, like, lipping it.

4703
03:30:36,600 --> 03:30:37,120
I was like...

4704
03:30:37,120 --> 03:30:37,600
Thank you!

4705
03:30:37,720 --> 03:30:38,160
Thank you!

4706
03:30:38,180 --> 03:30:38,480
Thank you!

4707
03:30:39,560 --> 03:30:40,980
I don't know if you could tell.

4708
03:30:41,600 --> 03:30:43,840
Early in the stream there was a mention of a nut allergy.

4709
03:30:43,940 --> 03:30:45,860
And it gave me war flashbacks to second grade.

4710
03:30:46,200 --> 03:30:50,280
When a girl who had a nut allergy caused the cafeteria to stop serving PB&J.

4711
03:30:50,360 --> 03:30:51,420
And I was so mad!

4712
03:30:52,720 --> 03:30:54,180
That's not her fault!

4713
03:30:57,480 --> 03:30:58,660
That's not her fault!

4714
03:31:01,930 --> 03:31:04,110
When was there a nut allergy mentioned?

4715
03:31:05,490 --> 03:31:06,690
It's her fault!

4716
03:31:10,510 --> 03:31:13,050
I'm not gonna lie though, I would be pretty sad too.

4717
03:31:13,410 --> 03:31:15,110
Especially because, uh...

4718
03:31:15,110 --> 03:31:16,130
Uh...

4719
03:31:16,790 --> 03:31:19,790
The elementary school I went to had Uncrustables.

4720
03:31:21,950 --> 03:31:23,330
And I loved those.

4721
03:31:23,670 --> 03:31:26,130
If I couldn't have one of those, I'd be so sad.

4722
03:31:28,650 --> 03:31:29,990
Not the PB&J.

4723
03:31:31,890 --> 03:31:32,770
What are those?

4724
03:31:32,950 --> 03:31:33,470
Uncrustables?

4725
03:31:34,090 --> 03:31:38,110
They're... They're pre-made PB&J sandwiches without the crust.

4726
03:31:38,770 --> 03:31:40,770
So it's exactly what the name is.

4727
03:31:41,850 --> 03:31:43,270
Why can't they be crusted?

4728
03:31:43,290 --> 03:31:45,210
I think some people just don't like the crust.

4729
03:31:46,250 --> 03:31:49,190
Do you guys like the crust or do you dislike the crust?

4730
03:31:50,370 --> 03:31:51,990
Even as a kid I ate the crust.

4731
03:31:52,450 --> 03:31:54,750
I never knew... What's wrong with the crust?

4732
03:31:54,930 --> 03:31:56,750
Why are people such crust aunties?

4733
03:32:00,230 --> 03:32:01,630
I don't get it.

4734
03:32:03,590 --> 03:32:04,850
I love the crust.

4735
03:32:07,070 --> 03:32:08,290
Crust auntie here.

4736
03:32:08,490 --> 03:32:09,890
But I've never wasted crust.

4737
03:32:11,450 --> 03:32:12,090
That's...

4738
03:32:12,790 --> 03:32:13,350
Right!

4739
03:32:13,610 --> 03:32:14,630
You're so good!

4740
03:32:17,550 --> 03:32:18,510
Good, good.

4741
03:32:19,390 --> 03:32:20,470
That's so...

4742
03:32:20,470 --> 03:32:22,130
So good of you.

4743
03:32:22,650 --> 03:32:23,330
Crusty gang.

4744
03:32:23,750 --> 03:32:23,950
Yeah!

4745
03:32:24,070 --> 03:32:24,850
The crust!

4746
03:32:24,910 --> 03:32:25,810
The crust!

4747
03:32:25,810 --> 03:32:26,210
Yes!

4748
03:32:27,290 --> 03:32:29,590
The crust is just kind of dry and bland, IMO.

4749
03:32:30,050 --> 03:32:30,690
I guess.

4750
03:32:31,030 --> 03:32:35,590
But you know, you have all the stuff on the sandwich to help you with eating the crust.

4751
03:32:35,890 --> 03:32:36,310
I don't know.

4752
03:32:40,330 --> 03:32:40,730
Yeah.

4753
03:32:41,970 --> 03:32:42,650
Crust gang.

4754
03:32:42,750 --> 03:32:43,410
Crust gang.

4755
03:32:44,170 --> 03:32:44,810
Okay, guys.

4756
03:32:44,930 --> 03:32:45,210
Anyway.

4757
03:32:45,490 --> 03:32:46,490
Thank you so much!

4758
03:32:46,710 --> 03:32:49,390
I hope you guys enjoyed being a little feared.

4759
03:32:50,170 --> 03:32:51,290
And a little fathomed.

4760
03:32:52,010 --> 03:32:53,190
And I will see you tomorrow.

4761
03:32:53,330 --> 03:32:54,430
I have a collab, I think.

4762
03:32:54,430 --> 03:32:57,050
I'm pretty sure it's still happening.

4763
03:33:00,090 --> 03:33:00,630
And...

4764
03:33:07,360 --> 03:33:07,900
Yeah.

4765
03:33:08,040 --> 03:33:08,380
Okay.

4766
03:33:08,440 --> 03:33:08,980
Yes, yes, yes.

4767
03:33:09,740 --> 03:33:10,280
Okay.

4768
03:33:11,000 --> 03:33:12,080
Yes, it's still happening.

4769
03:33:13,900 --> 03:33:14,880
I have a collab.

4770
03:33:15,940 --> 03:33:19,640
And I'm playing Pico Park 2 with a bunch of other people.

4771
03:33:19,980 --> 03:33:21,360
So that will be...

4772
03:33:22,480 --> 03:33:23,020
Something.

4773
03:33:25,060 --> 03:33:26,900
We'll see how that happens.

4774
03:33:27,320 --> 03:33:27,840
Arigatou!

4775
03:33:27,980 --> 03:33:28,520
